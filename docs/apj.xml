<div> Hubble Space Telescope, photometry, ultrafaint dwarf galaxies, Large Magellanic Cloud, dark matter simulations
总结:
使用哈勃空间望远镜进行深度光度测量，对来自GO-14734计划的10个目标进行了研究，包括6个确认的超微弱矮星系、3个超微弱矮星系候选体和一个可能的球状星团。其中6个目标是大麦哲伦星系的卫星或曾与其相互作用。通过最大似然技术确定了它们的结构参数。研究发现，与银河系的超微弱矮星系在星等-大小平面上没有系统差异。此外，将文献中的超微弱矮星系模拟属性转换为可观测空间，对比当前暗物质和重子物质模拟来探讨是否可以限制暗物质的性质。研究发现，使用冷暗物质、温暗物质和自相互作用暗物质模拟的超微弱矮星系在星等-大小平面上没有差异，但目前使用非传统暗物质模型模拟的超微弱矮星系样本相当有限。随着更多深度、广域的调查数据的出现，我们将有更多机会发现和表征这些超微弱的恒星系统和更广阔的低表面亮度宇宙。 <div>
We present deep Hubble Space Telescope photometry of 10 targets from Treasury Program GO-14734, including six confirmed ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxies, three UFD candidates, and one likely globular cluster. Six of these targets are satellites of, or have interacted with, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We determine their structural parameters using a maximum-likelihood technique. Using our newly derived half-light radius (rh) and V-band magnitude (MV) values in addition to literature values for other UFDs, we find that UFDs associated with the LMC do not show any systematic differences from Milky Way UFDs in the magnitude–size plane. Additionally, we convert simulated UFD properties from the literature into the MV–rh observational space to examine the abilities of current dark matter (DM) and baryonic simulations to reproduce observed UFDs. Some of these simulations adopt alternative DM models, thus allowing us to also explore whether the MV–rh plane could be used to constrain the nature of DM. We find no differences in the magnitude–size plane between UFDs simulated with cold, warm, and self-interacting DM, but note that the sample of UFDs simulated with alternative DM models is quite limited at present. As more deep, wide-field survey data become available, we will have further opportunities to discover and characterize these ultrafaint stellar systems and the greater low surface-brightness universe.

<div> 红移测量, 离子化检测, 光谱测量, Lyα发射线, JWST/NIRSpec观测

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章报告了对三个z≃7.47–7.75星系进行的研究。研究利用JWST/NIRSpec观测数据确认了这些星系的光谱红移，并表明它们为高度电离并贫金属的星系。研究还探讨了Lyα发射线的性质，包括线流量、速度偏移和空间延展性，并发现在其中一个星系中，MOSFIRE的测量值要高出1.3–5倍。另外，红移信息还表明这些星系在再电离时期的Lyα的逃逸情况可能存在多种多样的情景。这篇文章的研究结果为利用JWST/NIRSpec的高光谱分辨率观测约束斑状再电离的物理过程提供了重要的信息。 <div>
We analyze rest-frame ultraviolet to optical spectra of three z ≃ 7.47–7.75 galaxies whose Lyα emission lines were previously detected with Keck/MOSFIRE observations, using the JWST/NIRSpec observations from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science survey. From NIRSpec data, we confirm the systemic redshifts of these Lyα emitters, and emission-line ratio diagnostics indicate these galaxies were highly ionized and metal-poor. We investigate Lyα line properties, including the line flux, velocity offset, and spatial extent. For the one galaxy where we have both NIRSpec and MOSFIRE measurements, we find a significant offset in their flux measurements (∼1.3–5× greater in MOSFIRE) and a marginal difference in the velocity shifts. The simplest interpretation is that the Lyα emission is extended and not entirely encompassed by the NIRSpec slit. The cross-dispersion profiles in NIRSpec reveal that Lyα in one galaxy is significantly more extended than the nonresonant emission lines. We also compute the expected sizes of ionized bubbles that can be generated by the Lyα sources and discuss viable scenarios for the creation of sizable ionized bubbles (>1 physical Mpc). The source with the highest-ionization condition is possibly capable of ionizing its own bubble, while the other two do not appear to be capable of ionizing such a large region, but require additional sources of ionizing photons. Therefore, the fact that we detect Lyα from these galaxies suggests diverse scenarios for the escape of Lyα during the epoch of reionization. High-spectral-resolution spectra with JWST/NIRSpec will be extremely useful for constraining the physics of patchy reionization.

<div> Bell instability, cosmic rays, magnetic field amplification, hybrid simulations, saturation

这篇论文采用混合模拟研究了贝尔不共振流失稳定性随宇宙射线参数的演变。研究发现，饱和状态下，磁场增强后的磁压与初始宇宙射线各向异性压力相当，而不是与宇宙射线能量通量相当。这些结果为在贝尔不稳定性重要的许多天体物理环境中预期的总磁场增强提供了一个预测性的依据。 

<br /><br />总结: 本文通过混合模拟研究了贝尔不稳定性的演化过程，发现在饱和状态下磁场增强后的磁压与初始宇宙射线各向异性压力相当，为未来在天体物理环境中对磁场增强提供了预测依据。 <div>
The nonresonant streaming instability (Bell instability) plays a pivotal role in the acceleration and confinement of cosmic rays (CRs), yet the exact mechanism responsible for its saturation and the magnitude of the final amplified magnetic field have not been assessed from first principles. Using a survey of hybrid simulations (with kinetic ions and fluid electrons), we study the evolution of the Bell instability as a function of the parameters of the CR population. We find that at saturation, the magnetic pressure in the amplified field is comparable with the initial CR anisotropic pressure, rather than with the CR energy flux, as previously argued. These results provide a predictive prescription for the total magnetic field amplification expected in the many astrophysical environments where the Bell instability is important.

<div> 黑洞，AGN，磁流体动力学，双黑洞，吸积盘
<br /><br />通过3D广义相对论磁流体动力学仿真，研究了倾斜轨道上的黑洞与厚的AGN磁性阻尼吸积盘的相互作用。结果显示，次级黑洞会使射流产生2-4倍的非束缚质量流出率，在更大距离后融合为更连续的流出。另外，首次自洽地展示了主黑洞旋转与双黑洞轨道角动量之间的自旋轨道耦合会显著改变吸积盘和射流的方向，长时间内会产生60°-80°的进动。这一现象可能为厚AGN吸积盘持续进动提供了强有力的证据，并且表明如果在这样的系统中观察到这一效应，可能存在次级黑洞伴星。总体上，次级黑洞对盘的时间平均属性和主黑洞的吸积率影响微乎其微，与我们对扰动厚盘的估计一致。需要注意的是，在冷却的薄盘情况下，情况可能会发生显著变化。 <div>
Perturber objects interacting with supermassive black hole accretion disks are often invoked to explain observed quasiperiodic behavior in active galactic nuclei (AGN). We present global, 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of black holes on inclined orbits colliding with magnetically arrested thick AGN disks using a binary black hole spacetime with mass ratio 0.1. We do this by implementing an approximate time-dependent binary black hole metric into the GRMHD Athena++ code. The secondary enhances the unbound mass outflow rate 2–4 times above that provided by the disk in quasiperiodic outbursts, eventually merging into a more continuous outflow at larger distances. We present a simple analytic model that qualitatively agrees well with this result and can be used to extrapolate to unexplored regions of parameter space. We show self-consistently for the first time that spin–orbit coupling between the primary black hole spin and the binary orbital angular momentum causes the accretion disk and jet directions to precess significantly (by 60°–80°) on long timescales (e.g., ∼20 times the binary orbital period). Because this effect may be the only way for thick AGN disks to consistently precess, it could provide strong evidence of a secondary black hole companion if observed in such a system. Besides this new phenomenology, the time-average properties of the disk and accretion rates onto the primary are only marginally altered by the presence of the secondary, consistent with our estimate for a perturbed thick disk. This situation might drastically change in cooled thin disks.

<div> 主要关键词：潮汐能量，星的内部结构，颜色-等级图，热量注入，M67开放星团。

本文探讨了潮汐流动产生的动能转化为热量后，对恒星内部结构的影响，及其在颜色-等级图上的位置偏移。研究对象为M67开放星团附近主序带质量（1.26 M⊙）的恒星，根据第一原理计算得到的潮汐剪切能耗散速率来获得加热速率。模拟计算表明，潮汐受扰动的恒星在M67颜色-等级图上的位置偏移到比标准模型等高线预测的更高的光度和有效温度，包括与一些蓝变星对应的位置。因为潮汐加热从轨道中取走能量使其变短，蓝变星可能是合并或质量传递的祖先，也可能是这些过程的产物。 <br /><br />总结: 本文研究了潮汐加热对星体内部结构和在颜色-等级图上的位置偏移的影响，特别是在M67星团附近的恒星上的表现，结论指出蓝变星可能是合并或质量传递的前体，也可能是这些过程的产物。 <div>
The kinetic energy in tidal flows, when converted into heat, can affect the internal structure of a star and shift its location on a color–magnitude diagram from that of standard models. In this paper we explore the impact of injecting heat into stars with masses near the main-sequence turnoff mass (1.26 M⊙) of the open cluster M67. The heating rate is obtained from the tidal shear energy dissipation rate, which is calculated from first principles by simultaneously solving the equations that describe orbital motion and the response of a star’s layers to the gravitational, Coriolis, centrifugal, gas pressure, and viscous forces. The stellar structure models are computed with MESA. We focus on the effects of injecting heat in pulses lasting 0.01 Gyr, a time frame consistent with the synchronization timescale in binary systems. We find that the location of the tidally perturbed stars in the M67 color–magnitude diagram is shifted to significantly higher luminosities and effective temperatures than predicted by the standard model isochrone and includes locations corresponding to some of the blue straggler stars. Because tidal heating takes energy from the orbit, causing it to shrink, blue straggler stars could be merger or mass transfer progenitors, as well as products of these processes.

<title>Radial and Vertical Constraints on the Icy Origin of H2CO in the HD 163296 Protoplanetary Disk</title>

这篇文章报道了对围绕Herbig Ae星HD 163296的原行星盘进行的ALMA观测。研究得出了H2CO的柱密度、激发温度和正对顺相对比的径向分布，并确定了排放的垂直结构。研究结果表明，在盘的外部存在冷气相化学反应的辅助增加，且UV辐射可以穿透尘埃边缘，与冰体来源以及冷气相化学的结果一致。这一Herbig盘的结论与之前针对T Tauri盘TW Hya的研究结果形成对比，后者中冷气相化学的贡献更大。需要对其他源进行更多观测，以解开原行星盘中H2CO的主要形成途径。 <br /><br />总结: <br />本文报道了对Herbig Ae星HD 163296周围原行星盘的ALMA观测结果，分析了H2CO的径向、垂直分布以及正对顺比值，并得出了UV透射、冰体来源与冷气相化学的结论。 <div>
H2CO is a small organic molecule widely detected in protoplanetary disks. As a precursor to grain-surface formation of CH3OH, H2CO is considered an important precursor of O-bearing organic molecules that are locked in ices. Still, since gas-phase reactions can also form H2CO, there remains an open question on the channels by which organics form in disks, and how much the grain versus the gas pathways impact the overall organic reservoir. We present spectrally and spatially resolved Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of several ortho- and para-H2CO transitions toward the bright protoplanetary disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 163296. We derive column density, excitation temperature, and ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) radial profiles for H2CO, as well as disk-averaged values of NT ∼ 4 × 1012 cm−2, Tex ∼ 20 K, and OPR ∼ 2.7, respectively. We empirically determine the vertical structure of the emission, finding vertical heights of z/r ∼ 0.1. From the profiles, we find a relatively constant OPR ∼ 2.7 with radius, but still consistent with 3.0 among the uncertainties, a secondary increase of NT in the outer disk, and low Tex values that decrease with disk radius. Our resulting radial, vertical, and OPR constraints suggest an increased UV penetration beyond the dust millimeter edge, consistent with an icy origin but also with cold gas-phase chemistry. This Herbig disk contrasts previous results for the T Tauri disk, TW Hya, which had a larger contribution from cold gas-phase chemistry. More observations of other sources are needed to disentangle the dominant formation pathway of H2CO in protoplanetary disks.

总结:<br /><br />这篇论文研究了发生在AGN盘中的GRB，并分析了能量注入的情况。研究采用了标准的EFS模型，并考虑了短暂和长暂的GRB情形。计算了受加热盘物质辐射和GRB余辉两种辐射的光度曲线。发现能量注入有助于EFS以相对论速度突破低密度AGN盘的光球层，同时几乎不影响受加热盘物质辐射，但明显增强了GRB余辉的峰值流量。 <div>
Active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks are widely considered potential hosts for various high-energy transients, including gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The reactivation of GRB central engines can provide additional energy to shocks formed during the interaction of the initially ejected GRB jets with the circumburst material, commonly referred to as energy injections. In this paper, we study GRBs occurring in AGN disks within the context of energy injections. We adopt the standard external forward shock (EFS) model and consider both short- and long-duration GRB scenarios. Light curves for two types of radiation, namely, the radiation from the heated disk material (RHDM) and GRB afterglows, are computed. We find that the energy injection facilitates the EFS to break out from the photosphere of the low-density AGN disk at relativistic velocity. Moreover, the energy injection almost does not affect the RHDM but significantly enhances the peak flux of the GRB afterglows.

<title>Relative Occurrence Rate between Hot and Cold Jupiters as an Indicator to Probe Planet Migration</title>

本文提出了一个二阶统计参数ε，即热木星（HJ）和冷木星（CJ）的相对发生率（ε = ηHJ/ηCJ），以探测气态巨行星的迁移。通过对HJ和CJ频率的联合分析，可以揭示巨行星系统的动力学演变。研究发现，在观测中，随着恒星质量的变化，ε呈现出一个初步的趋势（97%的置信度），即当恒星质量从0.8到1.4太阳质量时，ε呈下降趋势，这可以通过不同恒星周围巨行星生长和盘面迁移时间尺度来解释。通过行星体和鹅卵石吸积模拟，证明经典的核心吸积+盘面迁移模型可以解释观察到的ε下降趋势。提出了两种方式来增加趋势的显著性并验证了反相关性。未来的工作需要更好地限制ε，特别是对M型矮星和更大质量的恒星。 <br /><br />总结: 本文提出了一个用于探测气态巨行星迁移的参数ε，并通过研究发现了其在不同恒星质量下的趋势，同时提出了对这一趋势的验证和进一步研究方向。 <div>
We propose a second-order statistic parameter ε, the relative occurrence rate between hot Jupiters (HJs) and cold Jupiters (CJs) (ε = ηHJ/ηCJ), to probe the migration of gas giants. Since the planet occurrence rate is the combined outcome of the formation and migration processes, a joint analysis of HJ and CJ frequency may shed light on the dynamical evolution of giant planet systems. We first investigate the behavior of ε as the stellar mass changes observationally. Based on the occurrence rate measurements of HJs (ηHJ) from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite survey and CJs (ηCJ) from the California Legacy Survey, we find a tentative trend (97% confidence) that ε drops when the stellar mass rises from 0.8 to 1.4 M⊙, which can be explained by different giant planet growth and disk migration timescales around different stars. We carry out planetesimal and pebble accretion simulations, both of which can reproduce the results of ηHJ, ηCJ, and ε. Our findings indicate that the classical core accretion + disk migration model can explain the observed decreasing trend of ε. We propose two ways to increase the significance of the trend and verify the anticorrelation. Future works are required to better constrain ε, especially for M dwarfs and for more massive stars.

<div> CAMIRA clusters, AGN power fraction, redshift, cluster center, multiwavelength data
总结:
本研究使用Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam选出大约100万个星系团和星系群成员星系，称为CAMIRA星系团，研究了活动星系核（AGN）的统计特性，重点关注AGN功率分数（fAGN）与星系团红移（zcl）以及距离星系团中心的关系。通过使用紫外-中红外波段的多波段数据和CIGALE代码与SKIRTOR AGN模型进行光谱能量分布拟合，确定了fAGN的值。研究发现，CAMIRA星系团中fAGN的值与zcl呈正相关，并且随着距离星系团中心的增加而增加。这些结果表明AGN群体的出现取决于红移和环境，并且高红移时期的星系群和星系团在AGN演化中起着重要作用。此外，研究还表明星系团合并可能会增强特别巨大星系团外围的AGN活动。我们的研究结果与CAMIRA星系团上的AGN数量分数相关的研究结果一致。 <div>
Herein, we present the statistical properties of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) for approximately 1 million member galaxies of galaxy groups and clusters with 0.1 < cluster redshift (zcl) < 1.4 selected using the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam, the so-called CAMIRA clusters. In this research, we focused on the AGN power fraction (fAGN), which is defined as the proportion of the contribution of AGNs to the total infrared (IR) luminosity, LIR (AGN)/LIR, and examined how fAGN depends on (i) zcl and (ii) the distance from the cluster center. We compiled multiwavelength data using the ultraviolet–mid-IR range. Moreover, we performed spectral energy distribution fits to determine fAGN using the CIGALE code with the SKIRTOR AGN model. We found that (i) the value of fAGN in the CAMIRA clusters is positively correlated with zcl, with the correlation slope being steeper than that for field galaxies, and (ii) fAGN exhibits a high value at the cluster outskirts. These results indicate that the emergence of the AGN population depends on the redshift and environment and that galaxy groups and clusters at high redshifts are important in AGN evolution. Additionally, we demonstrated that cluster–cluster mergers may enhance AGN activity at the outskirts of particularly massive galaxy clusters. Our findings are consistent with a related study on the CAMIRA clusters that was based on the AGN number fraction.

We present the results from a complex study of an eclipsing O-type binary (Aa+Ab) with the orbital period of PA = 3.2254367 days that forms part of a higher-order multiple system in a configuration of (A+B)+C. We derived masses of the Aa+Ab binary of M1 = 19.02 ± 0.12 and M2 = 17.50 ± 0.13 M ⊙, the radii of R1 = 7.70 ± 0.05 and R2 = 6.64 ± 0.06 R⊙, and temperatures of T1 = 34,250 ± 500 K and T2 = 33,750 ± 500 K. From the analysis of the radial velocities, we found a spectroscopic orbit of A in the outer A+B system with PA+B = 195.8 days (PA+B/PA ≈ 61). In the O − C analysis, we confirmed this orbit and found another component orbiting the A+B system with PAB+C = 2550 days (PAB+C/PA+B ≈ 13). From the total mass of the inner binary and its outer orbit, we estimated the mass of the third object, MB ≳ 10.7 M⊙. From the light travel time effect fit to the O − C data, we obtained the limit for the mass of the fourth component, MC ≳ 7.3 M⊙. These extra components contribute about 20%–30% (increasing with wavelength) to the total system light. From the comparison of model spectra with the multiband photometry, we derived a distance modulus of 18.59 ± 0.06 mag, a reddening of 0.16 ± 0.02 mag, and an RV of 3.2. This work is part of our ongoing project, which aims to calibrate the surface brightness–color relation for early-type stars.

We present new observations of the central 1 kpc of the M82 starburst obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope near-infrared camera instrument at a resolution θ ∼ 0.″05–0.″1 (∼1–2 pc). The data comprises images in three mostly continuum filters (F140M, F250M, and F360M), and filters that contain [Fe ii] (F164N), H2v = 1 → 0 (F212N), and the 3.3 μm polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) feature (F335M). We find prominent plumes of PAH emission extending outward from the central starburst region, together with a network of complex filamentary substructures and edge-brightened bubble-like features. The structure of the PAH emission closely resembles that of the ionized gas, as revealed in Paschen α and free–free radio emission. We discuss the origin of the structure, and suggest the PAHs are embedded in a combination of neutral, molecular, and photoionized gas.

在大规模星系调查的时代，光度和光谱数据的交叉使用变得尤为重要。这篇文章介绍了如何利用流形学习方法，从星系的光度测量中估算出光谱特征，而无需过于依赖模型的复杂度。研究重点在于使用宇宙演化调查（COSMOS）中星系的光度测量来估算 4000 Å 的断裂特征，并观察到与星系质量和红移的关联。这些发现有助于说明星系形成和恒星形成率随时间推移而下降的现象。同时也展示了光度和光谱数据的交叉使用能够为星系研究提供更为高效的分析手段。 <br /><br />总结: 本文介绍了在大规模星系调查中利用流形学习方法估算光谱特征的方法，以及利用观测数据得出的相关性分析结果。这些发现有助于解释星系形成和恒星形成率随时间推移而下降的现象。 <div>
Entering the era of large-scale galaxy surveys, which will deliver unprecedented amounts of photometric and spectroscopic data, there is a growing need for more efficient, data-driven, and less model-dependent techniques to analyze the spectral energy distribution of galaxies. In this work, we demonstrate that by taking advantage of manifold learning approaches, we can estimate spectroscopic features of large samples of galaxies from their broadband photometry when spectroscopy is available only for a fraction of the sample. This will be done by applying the self-organizing map algorithm on broadband colors of galaxies and mapping partially available spectroscopic information into the trained maps. In this pilot study, we focus on estimating the 4000 Å break in a magnitude-limited sample of galaxies in the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field. We also examine this method to predict the HδA index given our available spectroscopic measurements. We use observed galaxy colors (u,g,r,i,z,Y,J,H), as well as spectroscopic measurements for a fraction of the sample from the LEGA-C and zCOSMOS spectroscopic surveys to estimate this feature for our parent photometric sample. We recover the D4000 feature for galaxies that only have broadband colors with uncertainties about twice the uncertainty of the employed spectroscopic surveys. Using these measurements, we observe a positive correlation between D4000 and the stellar mass of the galaxies in our sample with weaker D4000 features for higher-redshift galaxies at fixed stellar masses. These can be explained by the downsizing scenario for the formation of galaxies and the decrease in their specific star formation rate as well as the aging of their stellar populations over this time period.

<div> 关键词: 瞬时区域，磁通量出现，辅助磁通量出现，磁轴，Ω环

总结:<br /><br />这项研究对太阳瞬时区域（ER）中辅助磁通量出现（SFEs）的复杂模式进行了详细研究。通过对Solar Dynamics Observatory的观测，研究了5个ER的磁通量最大值约为1020 Mx，其中每个ER都有数十个SFEs，平均新出现的磁通量约为5×1018 Mx。SFEs的磁通量频率符合幂律分布，大多数出现在ER的正负极性之间，并且生长时间集中在1小时内。研究发现SFE的磁轴呈随机分布。提出了SFEs与ERs之间的关系，认为SFEs可能是ERs磁通管束的一部分，并且SFEs部分是出现的Ω环。 <div>
As a relatively active region, the ephemeral region (ER) exhibits a highly complex pattern of magnetic flux emergence. We aim to study in detail the secondary flux emergences (SFEs), which we define as bipoles that appear close to ERs and finally coalesce with ERs after a period of time. We study SFEs during the whole process, from the emergence to the decay of five ERs observed by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The maximum unsigned magnetic flux for each ER is around 1020 Mx. Each ER has tens of SFEs with an average emerging magnetic flux of approximately 5 × 1018 Mx. The frequency of normalized magnetic flux for all the SFEs follows a power-law distribution with an index of −2.08. The majority of SFEs occur between the positive and negative polarities of an ER, and their growth time is concentrated within 1 hr. The magnetic axis of SFE is found to exhibit a random distribution in the five ERs. We suggest that the relationship between SFEs and ERs can be understood by regarding the photospheric magnetic field observations as cross sections of an emerging magnetic structure. Tracking the evolution of ERs, we propose that these SFEs in ERs may have emerged consequentially from the bundle of flux tubes of ERs and that SFEs are partially emerged Ω-loops.

总结:<br />
研究发现，帕克太阳探测器观测到的太阳风间隙表现出低密度、极低速度、低质子温度和基本无磁场偏转的特性，近音速间隙主要是由于速度极低，而不是声速。利用等离子体模型追踪发现，这些近音速间隙都与日冕空洞内部的边界相连。在近音速间隙附近观测到的赫利欧圈局部电流片和赫利欧圈电流片交叉，表明近音速太阳风是慢风和快风之间的过渡层。磁场波动的幅度与径向声速马赫数存在相关性。磁场偏转在近音速临界点附近基本消失，这表明磁场波动起源于声速临界点以上。 <div>
We identify and examine the solar wind intervals near the sonic critical point (i.e., MS ∼ 1) observed by the Parker Solar Probe. The near-subsonic wind intervals show similar properties: a low density, an extremely low velocity, a low proton temperature, and essentially no magnetic field deflections compared with the surrounding solar wind. The extremely low velocity is the primary contributor to the near crossing of the sonic critical point rather than the sound speed, which is roughly constant in these intervals. Source tracing with a potential-field source-surface model suggests that the near subsonic intervals all connect to the boundaries inside coronal holes. Heliospheric current sheet (HCS) and partial HCS crossings around the near subsonic intervals indicate that the near subsonic wind is a transition layer between the slow and fast winds. The above scenario is consistent with the nature of the near-subsonic wind as a low-Mach-number boundary layer, which facilitates the crossing of the sonic critical point at 15–20 RS. Moreover, we find a dependence of the amplitude of switchbacks on the radial sonic Mach number. Magnetic field deflections essentially disappear near the sonic critical point, which suggests that switchbacks originate from above the sonic critical point.

Gravitational-wave detectors are unveiling a population of binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to redshifts z ≈ 1, and are starting to constrain how the BBH population evolves with redshift. We present predictions for the redshift evolution of the BBH mass and spin distributions for systems originating from dense star clusters. Utilizing a grid of 144 state-of-the-art dynamical models for globular clusters, we demonstrate that BBH merger rates peak at higher redshifts for larger black hole primary masses M1. Specifically, for M1 ≳ 40 M⊙, the BBH merger rate reaches its peak at redshift z ≈ 2.1, while for M1 ≲ 20 M⊙, the peak occurs at z ≈ 1.1, assuming that the cluster formation rate peaks at z = 2.2. The average BBH primary mass also increases from ∼10 M⊙ at z = 0 to ∼30 M⊙ at z = 10. We show that ∼20% BBHs contain massive remnants from next-generation mergers, with this fraction increasing (decreasing) for larger (smaller) primary masses. This difference is not large enough to significantly alter the effective spins of the BBH population originating from globular clusters, and we find that their effective spin distribution does not evolve across cosmic time. These findings can be used to distinguish BBHs from dense star clusters by future gravitational-wave observations.

The abundance of faint dwarf galaxies is determined by the underlying population of low-mass dark matter (DM) halos and the efficiency of galaxy formation in these systems. Here, we quantify potential galaxy formation and DM constraints from future dwarf satellite galaxy surveys. We generate satellite populations using a suite of Milky Way (MW)–mass cosmological zoom-in simulations and an empirical galaxy–halo connection model, and assess sensitivity to galaxy formation and DM signals when marginalizing over galaxy–halo connection uncertainties. We find that a survey of all satellites around one MW-mass host can constrain a galaxy formation cutoff at peak virial masses of at the 1σ level; however, a tail toward low prevents a 2σ measurement. In this scenario, combining hosts with differing bright satellite abundances significantly reduces uncertainties on at the 1σ level, but the 2σ tail toward low persists. We project that observations of one (two) complete satellite populations can constrain warm DM models with mWDM ≈ 10 keV (20 keV). Subhalo mass function (SHMF) suppression can be constrained to ≈70%, 60%, and 50% that in cold dark matter (CDM) at peak virial masses of 108, 109, and 1010M⊙, respectively; SHMF enhancement constraints are weaker (≈20, 4, and 2 times that in CDM, respectively) due to galaxy–halo connection degeneracies. These results motivate searches for faint dwarf galaxies beyond the MW and indicate that ongoing missions like Euclid and upcoming facilities including the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will probe new galaxy formation and DM physics.

The latitudinal structure of the solar wind varies during the cycle of solar activity. Analysis of this variation is important for understanding the solar activity and interpretation of observations of heliospheric energetic neutral hydrogen atoms and interstellar neutral (ISN) atoms inside the heliosphere, which yield information on the heliosphere and its interaction with the interstellar medium. Existing methods of retrieving this information from indirect remote-sensing measurements of phenomena, including the heliospheric backscatter glow and interplanetary scintillations of remote radio sources, are challenging to apply in real time. Here, we propose a method WawHelioIonMP of approximate retrieval of latitudinal profiles of the ionization rates of ISN H using a machine-learning-based interpretation of the helioglow. Assuming that we know their history during two past solar cycles and have observations of the helioglow for close-to-circumsolar circles with a radius close to 90°, we derive statistically an algebraic relation between the ionization profiles and lightcurves. With the relation reversed, we are then able to derive the ionization rate profiles based on observed light curves, such as those planned for the GLObal solar Wind Structure (GLOWS) experiment on the forthcoming NASA mission Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP). The application of this method is straightforward and rapid because complex simulations are no longer needed. We present the method of retrieval of the profiles of the ionization rates, leaving the discussion of details of the decomposition of the retrieved ionization rate profiles into profiles of the solar wind speed and density to a future paper.

Filamentary structures are ubiquitously found in high-mass star-forming clouds. To investigate the relationship between filaments and star formation, we carry out the INFANT (Investigations of Massive Filaments and Sar Formation) survey, a multiscale, multiwavelength survey of massive filamentary clouds with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) band 3/band 6 and Very Large Array K band. In this first paper, we present the ALMA band 6 continuum observations toward a sample of eight high-mass star-forming filaments. We covered each target with an approximately rectangular mosaic field of view with two 12 m array configurations, achieving an angular resolution of ∼0.″6 (2700 au at 4.5 kpc) and a continuum rms of ∼0.1 mJy beam−1 (∼0.06 M⊙ in gas mass assuming 15 K). We identify cores using the getsf and astrodendro and find the former is more robust in terms of both identification and measuring flux densities. We identify in total 183 dense cores (15–36 cores in each cloud) and classify their star formation states via outflow and warm gas tracers. The protostellar cores are statistically more massive than the prestellar cores, possibly indicating further accretion onto cores after the formation of protostars. For the high-mass end ( > 1.5 M⊙) of the core mass function (CMF) we derive a power-law index of −1.15 ± 0.12 for the whole sample and −1.70 ± 0.25 for the prestellar population. We also find a steepening trend in CMF with cloud evolution (−0.89 ± 0.15 for the young group versus. −1.44 ± 0.25 for the evolved group) and discuss its implications for cluster formation.

<div> 光谱，超新星，近红外，数据分析，模型参数<br />
总结:<br />
这篇文章介绍了一种利用光学光谱对Ia型超新星（SNe Ia）在近红外（NIR）波长范围内的光谱行为进行外推的方法。通过对卡内基超新星项目I＆II光学和NIR FIRE光谱数据进行主成分分析，可以产生能够进行这种外推的模型。这种方法不同于先前的光谱模板方法，不仅仅通过SNe Ia的光变曲线属性来参数化模型，从而更灵活地产生外推的NIR flux。研究发现，在大多数测试案例中（包括Branch核心正常和浅硅亚型），这些外推和观测之间的总集成NIR flux差异约为-3.1％至-2.7％。然而，对于其他测试发现与观测的较大偏差，这可能是由于训练样本中高速和宽线SNe Ia有限。最大光度主分量能够对色伸展光变曲线参数sBV进行光谱预测，与光度测量的值大致相符。此外，结果表明这些外推结果与NIR模板比较良好，尽管在大多数情况下模板略微更适合观测，这显示了需要更多同时进行光学+NIR光谱观测，以真正了解NIR中SNe Ia的多样性。 <div>
We present a method of extrapolating the spectroscopic behavior of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength regime up to 2.30 μm using optical spectroscopy. Such a process is useful for accurately estimating K-corrections and other photometric quantities of SNe Ia in the NIR. A principal component analysis is performed on data consisting of Carnegie Supernova Project I & II optical and NIR FIRE spectra to produce models capable of making these extrapolations. This method differs from previous spectral template methods by not parameterizing models strictly by photometric light-curve properties of SNe Ia, allowing for more flexibility of the resulting extrapolated NIR flux. A difference of around −3.1% to −2.7% in the total integrated NIR flux between these extrapolations and the observations is seen here for most test cases including Branch core-normal and shallow-silicon subtypes. However, larger deviations from the observation are found for other tests, likely due to the limited high-velocity and broad-line SNe Ia in the training sample. Maximum-light principal components are shown to allow for spectroscopic predictions of the color-stretch light-curve parameter, sBV, within approximately ±0.1 units of the value measured with photometry. We also show these results compare well with NIR templates, although in most cases the templates are marginally more fitting to observations, illustrating a need for more concurrent optical+NIR spectroscopic observations to truly understand the diversity of SNe Ia in the NIR.

现代宇宙学面临重要挑战，如哈勃张力、 El Gordo的碰撞，或者不可能的星系（z > 10）。标准模型的轻微修改提出了新的参数（例如早期和动力暗能量）。另一方面，替代方案，比如沿海宇宙（例如超锥模型和空间平坦Rh = ct宇宙），在统计意义上与大多数观测测试相容，但在匹配观测到的物质含量方面仍存在理论问题，因为它们预测“零主动引力质量”。为了解决这些悬而未决的问题，我们建议广义相对论在宇宙尺度上可能无效，但在局部尺度上是有效的。这一提议是从超锥模型的两个主要特征中解决的：（1）背景度规与物质内容无关，（2）观测到的宇宙加速度是虚假的，是由于坐标的扭曲立体投影产生的从均匀流形到表观径向不均匀。最后，为了支持讨论，标准观测测试在这里得到了更新，显示超锥模型完全适用于Ia型超新星、类星体、星系团、重子声学振荡和宇宙测时器数据集。

Modern cosmology presents important challenges such as the Hubble Tension, El Gordo’s collision, or the impossible galaxies (z > 10). Slight modifications to the standard model propose new parameters (e.g., the early and dynamical dark energy). On the other hand, alternatives such as the coasting universes (e.g., the hyperconical model and the spatially flat Rh = ct universe) are statistically compatible with most of the observational tests, but still present theoretical problems in matching the observed matter contents since they predict a “zero active gravitational mass.” To solve these open issues, we suggest that general relativity might be not valid at cosmic scales, but it would be valid at local scales. This proposal is addressed from two main features of the embedding hyperconical model: (1) the background metric would be independent of the matter content, and (2) the observed cosmic acceleration would be fictitious and because of a distorted stereographic projection of coordinates that produce an apparent radial inhomogeneity from homogeneous manifolds. Finally, to support the discussion, standard observational tests were updated here, showing that the hyperconical model is adequately fitted to Type Ia supernovae, quasars, galaxy clusters, baryon acoustic oscillations, and cosmic chronometer data sets.

这篇文章研究了 Milky Way 大小的盘状星系的热环绕星系介质的气体动力学。通过合成观测，发现热相通常表现为从盘状星系中的反馈过程驱动的流出、近银河平面的径向流入和旋转。而在一些系统中，速度场更加无序和湍流。文章指出，具有约1电子伏的光谱分辨率可以测量快速且炽热的流出（约200-500千米/秒），旋转速度可以通过边缘星系的线偏移来测量（约100-200千米/秒），而缓慢的流入（约50-100千米/秒）则较难在投影中测量，但可以通过多组分光谱拟合来检测。文章还强调了对测量速度的敏感性取决于使用的发射线，指出测量这些流动将限制这些星系中气体演化的理论。 <div>
The hot, X-ray-emitting phase of the circumgalactic medium of massive galaxies is believed to be the reservoir of baryons from which gas flows onto the central galaxy and into which feedback from active galactic nuclei and stars inject mass, momentum, energy, and metals. These effects shape the velocity fields of the hot gas, which can be observed via the Doppler shifting and broadening of emission lines by X-ray integral field units. In this work, we analyze the gas kinematics of the hot circumgalactic medium of Milky Way–mass disk galaxies from the TNG50 simulation with synthetic observations to determine how future instruments can probe this velocity structure. We find that the hot phase is often characterized by outflows from the disk driven by feedback processes, radial inflows near the galactic plane, and rotation, although in some systems the velocity field is more disorganized and turbulent. With a spectral resolution of ∼1 eV, fast and hot outflows (∼200–500 km s−1) can be measured, depending on the orientation of the galaxy on the sky. The rotation velocity of the hot phase (∼100–200 km s−1) can be measured using line shifts in edge-on galaxies, and is slower than that of colder gas phases but similar to stellar rotation velocities. By contrast, the slow inflows (∼50–100 km s−1) are difficult to measure in projection with these other components, but may be detected in multicomponent spectral fits. We find that the velocity measured is sensitive to which emission lines are used. Measuring these flows will constrain theories of how the gas in these galaxies evolves.

IceCube在2011年至2021年5月收集了数据，用于搜索天空中的中微子闪耀现象。数据集包含源自带电电子中微子和τ中微子相互作用以及全味道中微子中性电流相互作用的级联样式事件。这些数据与以前的全部天空搜索中使用的轨迹样式事件数据集在统计上是独立的。虽然角分辨率较低，但由于低背景特性，级联数据集具有竞争力，并且与之前的搜索方法相辅相成。在进行全天扫描时没有观察到明显的中微子发射闪耀现象。针对不同持续时间的中微子闪耀制定了上限。此外，还提出了关于这些闪耀对漫射天体中微子流的贡献的限制，表明多个未解决的瞬变源可能会对漫射天体中微子流做出贡献。 <div>
Neutrino flares in the sky are searched for in data collected by IceCube between 2011 and 2021 May. This data set contains cascade-like events originating from charged-current electron neutrino and tau neutrino interactions and all-flavor neutral-current interactions. IceCube’s previous all-sky searches for neutrino flares used data sets consisting of track-like events originating from charged-current muon neutrino interactions. The cascade data set is statistically independent of the track data sets, and while inferior in angular resolution, the low-background nature makes it competitive and complementary to previous searches. No statistically significant flare of neutrino emission was observed in an all-sky scan. Upper limits are calculated on neutrino flares of varying duration from 1 hr to 100 days. Furthermore, constraints on the contribution of these flares to the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux are presented, showing that multiple unresolved transient sources may contribute to the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux.

<br />
这篇文章通过对泛神论+目录中的一组Ia型超新星的Hubble-Lemaître图进行方向分析，揭示了Hubble常数H0的角向依赖性。研究显示，在本地宇宙（0.015 ≤ z ≤ 0.06）中，物质结构呈现出一个统计显著的偶极变化，其运动趋向于（l, b）=（326.°1 ± 11.°2, 27.°8 ± 11.°2），速度为132.14 ± 109.3 km s−1，这个方向接近于Shapley超星团（lShapley，bShapley）=（311.°5, 32.°3）。与之相反的偶极方向指向着Dipole Repeller结构。研究结果证实了引力偶极系统Shapley-Dipole Repeller很好地解释了本地宇宙中观测到的物质结构的流速场。此外，研究还提供了Hubble常数H0的测量结果为70.39 ± 1.4 km s−1 Mpc−1 ，在有效距离102.8 Mpc，z≃0.025。
<br /><br />总结: Hubble-Lemaître图用于研究本地宇宙的物质结构运动；研究发现H0存在显著的角向变化，指向Shapley超星团，速度为132.14 km s−1；结果支持引力偶极系统Shapley-Dipole Repeller很好地解释了物质结构的流速场；得到了H0的测量结果为70.39 km s−1 Mpc−1，在有效距离102.8 Mpc。 <div>
The bulk flow in the Local Universe is a collective phenomenon due to the peculiar motions of matter structures, which, instead of moving in random directions, appears to follow an approximate dipole velocity flow. We apply a directional analysis to investigate, through the Hubble-Lemaître diagram, the angular dependence of the Hubble constant H0 of a sample of Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon+ catalog in the Local Universe (0.015 ≤ z ≤ 0.06). We perform a directional analysis that reveals a statistically significant dipole variation of H0, at more than 99.9% confidence level, showing that matter structures follow a dipole bulk flow motion toward (l, b) = (326.°1 ± 11.°2, 27.°8 ± 11.°2), close to the Shapley supercluster (lShapley, bShapley) = (311.°5, 32.°3), with velocity 132.14 ± 109.3 km s−1 at the effective distance 102.83 ± 10.2 Mpc. Interestingly, the antipodal direction of this dipole points close to the Dipole Repeller structure. Our analyses confirm that the gravitational dipole system Shapley-Dipole Repeller explains well the observed bulk flow velocity field in the Local Universe. Furthermore, we performed robustness tests that support our results. Additionally, our approach provides a measurement of the Hubble constant H0 = 70.39 ± 1.4 km s−1 Mpc−1, at the effective distance 102.8 Mpc, z ≃ 0.025.

<div> 关键词: 惯性波, 太阳表面, 太阳内部, 辐射模式耦合, 震动观测<br />
<br />总结:
太阳表面观测到的惯性波可能延伸到太阳更深层。研究利用了地震观测技术，探索了这些运动，以分辨径向和纬向定态模式。利用空间观测资料分析了2010年至2017年间的8年数据，通过辐射模式耦合测量了声学模式之间和不同频率间的耦合，以捕捉惯性模式的不同长度尺度。研究发现在高纬度存在频率约为-80nHz、方位角t=1的惯性模式，存在于整个对流区。罗斯贝模式的存在可能一直延伸到约0.83R⊙的深度，而对于高方位角的罗斯贝信号在该深度以下很难与噪音区分开。还发现这些模式的振幅随深度增加而下降，同时我们发现罗斯贝模式的纬向本征函数与扇形球谐函数有所不同，需要小心解释这些特性。这些深度相关特征的研究有助于在分离p模式地震学之外捕捉内部动态。 <div>
Recently discovered inertial waves, observed on the solar surface, likely extend to the deeper layers of the Sun. Utilizing helioseismic techniques, we explore these motions, allowing us to discern inertial mode eigenfunctions in both radial and latitudinal orientations. We analyze 8 yr of space-based observations (2010–2017) taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory using normal mode coupling. Couplings between the same and different-degree acoustic modes and different frequency bins are measured in order to capture the various length scales of the inertial modes. We detect inertial modes at high latitude with azimuthal order t = 1 and frequency ∼ −80 nHz, measured in a corotating frame with a rotation frequency of 453.1 nHz. This mode is present in the entire convection zone. The presence of Rossby modes may be seen down to a depth of ∼0.83R⊙, and the Rossby signal is indistinguishable from noise below that depth for high azimuthal order. We find that the amplitudes of these modes increase with depth down to around 0.92R⊙ and decrease below that depth. We find that the latitudinal eigenfunctions of Rossby modes deviate from sectoral spherical harmonics if we use a similar approach as adopted in earlier studies. We find that spatial leakage and even pure noise in the measurements of nonsectoral components can also explain the abovementioned characteristics of the latitudinal eigenfunctions. This realization underscores the necessity for careful interpretation when considering the latitudinal eigenfunctions of Rossby modes. Exploring the depth-dependent characteristics of these modes will enable us to capture interior dynamics distinctly, separate from p-mode seismology.

<br />总结:<br />最近的大面积射电连续波调查发现了一类新的源，即所谓的奇异射电圈（ORC）。研究人员进行了对这些源中心或潜在相关的六个星系的宝石光学光谱学研究，并进行了Legacy Survey成像和Prospector拟合。结果显示，具有中心星系的三个ORC的距离在0.27至0.55之间，证实了射电圈的大固有直径（300-500 kpc）。这些中心星系都是质量较大、红色、无遮挡的椭圆星系，具有古老的恒星群。它们具有LINER光谱类型，受冲击或活动星系核（AGN）的能量驱动。所有三个中心星系都有低辐射、无尘埃的AGN。中央星系的相似性表明它们可能有共同的起源，也许是来自古老星暴的冲击波。另外两个ORC相邻且没有明显中心星系，但它们中间的z=0.25的盘状星系却 藏有2型、中等亮度的AGN。因此可能是这些AGN的射电喷流。 <div>
A new class of sources, the so-called odd radio circles (ORCs), have been discovered by recent sensitive, large-area radio continuum surveys. The distances of these sources have so far relied on photometric redshifts of optical galaxies found at the centers of or near ORCs. Here we present Gemini rest-frame optical spectroscopy of six galaxies at the centers of, or potentially associated with, the first five ORC discoveries. We supplement this with Legacy Survey imaging and Prospector fits to their griz+W1/W2 photometry. Of the three ORCs with central galaxies, all lie at distances (z = 0.27–0.55) that confirm the large intrinsic diameters of the radio circles (300–500 kpc). The central galaxies are massive (M* ∼ 1011M☉), red, unobscured ellipticals with old (≳1 Gyr) stellar populations. They have LINER spectral types that are shock-powered or active galactic nucleus (AGN)-powered. All three host low-luminosity, radio-quiet AGN. The similarity of their central galaxies is consistent with a common origin, perhaps as a blast wave from an ancient starburst. The other two ORCs are adjacent and have no prominent central galaxies. However, the z = 0.25 disk galaxy that lies between them hosts a Type 2, moderate-luminosity AGN. They may instead be the lobes of a radio jet from this AGN.

<div> T-Tauri Stars, starspots, near-infrared spectroscopic survey, stellar masses, stellar ages
总结:
T-Tauri星，年轻的原主序星，由于存在大规模的星斑而使年龄和质量的确定变得困难。文章通过近红外光谱调查了Taurus-Auriga中10颗T-Tauri星，对它们的星斑填充因子和温度进行了表征，分析了这对温度和亮度测定的影响，以及对推断的恒星质量和年龄的后果。研究利用马尔科夫链蒙特卡洛算法构建了带有星斑的恒星的组合模型，并利用这一方法还原了目标的光谱和分子特征强度。通过多周期观测的星，还对光谱变化和填充因子随K2和AAVSO光度测定的旋转周期进行了相关性分析。结合星斑校正的有效温度和Gaia距离，计算了光度并利用星斑模型推断了样本恒星的星斑校正质量和年龄。这种星斑校正方法使得质量平均增加了60%，年龄增加了一倍，相比于传统方法使用不考虑星斑影响的光谱测定。 <div>
Accurate age and mass determinations for young pre-main-sequence stars are made challenging by the presence of large-scale starspots. We present results from a near-infrared spectroscopic survey of 10 T-Tauri Stars in Taurus-Auriga that characterize spot-filling factors and temperatures, the resulting effects on temperature and luminosity determinations, and the consequences for inferred stellar masses and ages. We constructed composite models of spotted stars by combining BTSettl-CIFIST synthetic spectra of atmospheres to represent the spots and the photosphere along with continuum emission from a warm inner disk. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, we find the best-fit spot and photospheric temperatures, spot-filling factors, as well as disk-filling factors. This methodology allowed us to reproduce the 0.75–2.40 μm stellar spectra and molecular feature strengths for all of our targets, disentangling the complicated multicomponent emission. For a subset of stars with multiepoch observations spanning an entire stellar rotation, we correlate the spectral variability and changes in the filling factors with rotational periods observed in K2 and AAVSO photometry. Combining spot-corrected effective temperatures and Gaia distances, we calculate luminosities and use the Stellar Parameters of Tracks with Starspots models to infer spot-corrected masses and ages for our sample of stars. Our method of accounting for spots results in an average increase of 60% in mass and a doubling in age with respect to traditional methods using optical spectra that do not account for the effect of spots.

We search for mass segregation in the intermediate-aged open cluster NGC 6819 within a carefully identified sample of probable cluster members. Using photometry from Gaia, Pan-STARRS, and the Two Micron All Sky Survey as inputs for a Bayesian statistics software suite, BASE-9, we identify a rich population of (photometric) binaries and derive posterior distributions for the cluster age, distance, metallicity, and reddening, as well as star-by-star photometric membership probabilities, masses, and mass ratios (for binaries). Within our entire sample, we identify 2632 cluster members and 777 binaries. We then select a main-sequence “primary sample” with 14.85 < 19.5, containing 1342 cluster members and 250 binaries with mass ratios q > 0.5, to investigate mass segregation. Within this primary sample, we find the binary radial distribution is significantly shifted toward the cluster center as compared to the single stars, resulting in a binary fraction that increases significantly toward the cluster core. Furthermore, we find that within the binary sample, more massive binaries have more centrally concentrated radial distributions than less massive binaries. The same is true for the single stars. We verify the expectation of mass segregation for this stellar sample in NGC 6819 through both relaxation time arguments and by investigating a sophisticated N-body model of the cluster. Importantly, this is the first study to investigate mass segregation of the binaries in the open cluster NGC 6819.

总结: 本文首次应用了蒙特卡罗星团模拟方法来研究球状星团在时间依赖的银河势场中的潮汐尾和恒星流形成。研究发现潮汐尾可以绕行整个银河后形成返回潮汐尾，并增强流的速度分散。此外，重新审视了潜在逃逸体的逃逸时间尺度Δt，发现了与三体问题中的混沌散射相关的新行为。研究还发现，随着星团的质量损失和内部演化，Δt的中值从约10亿年降低到不到100百万年。最后，提出了改进蒙特卡罗模拟方法以实现从完整星团模拟中得出大规模潮汐尾/恒星流模型的潜在改进。<br /><br />总结: 本文首次应用蒙特卡洛星团模拟研究了球状星团在银河系中的潮汐尾和恒星流形成，通过模拟发现了潮汐尾的形成和加强速度分散的现象，并重新审视了潜在逃逸体的逃逸时间尺度。同时研究还发现了Δt对于星团内部演化的影响，并提出了改进模拟方法的可能方向。 <div>
We apply for the first time orbit-averaged Monte Carlo star cluster simulations to study tidal tail and stellar stream formation from globular clusters (GCs), assuming a circular orbit in a time-dependent spherical Galactic potential. Treating energetically unbound bodies—potential escapers (PEs)—as collisionless enables this fast but spherically symmetric method to capture asymmetric extratidal phenomena with exquisite detail. Reproducing stream features such as epicyclic overdensities, we show how returning tidal tails can form after the stream fully circumnavigates the Galaxy, enhancing the stream's velocity dispersion by several kilometers per second in our ideal case. While a truly clumpy, asymmetric, and evolving Galactic potential would greatly diffuse such tails, they warrant scrutiny as potentially excellent constraints on the Galaxy’s history and substructure. Reexamining the escape timescale Δt of PEs, we find new behavior related to chaotic scattering in the three-body problem; the Δt distribution features sharp plateaus corresponding to distinct locally smooth patches of the chaotic saddle separating the phase-space basins of escape. We study for the first time Δt in an evolving cluster, finding that for PEs with (low, high) Jacobi energy EJ, flatter than for a static cluster ( ). Accounting for cluster mass loss and internal evolution lowers the median Δt from ∼10 Gyr to ≲100 Myr. We finally outline potential improvements to escape in the Monte Carlo method intended to enable the first large grids of tidal tail/stellar stream models from full GC simulations and detailed comparison to stream observations.

<br />Gaia望远镜在2023年3月6日发现了Gaia23bab的2等级爆发，这是银河平面上一个年轻的恒星物体。研究人员通过大型双望远镜对Gaia23bab进行了观测，并收集了所有公开的多波段光度数据，重建了历史光变曲线。曲线显示在过去10年内（2013年、2017年和2023年）有三次爆发，持续时间和振幅都符合EXor变星的特征。研究估计，由于这些爆发，该恒星上积累的质量大约是如果源泉保持平静相同时间的两倍。光度分析显示Gaia23bab是一个II类源，年龄≲1百万年，光谱类型为G3-K0，恒星光度约为4.0太阳光度，质量约为1.6太阳质量。光学/近红外光谱富含发射线。通过这些线的分析，研究人员测量了一个与EXors一致的吸积光度和质量吸积率（Laccburst约为3.7太阳光度，burst约为2.0×10^-7太阳质量每年）。总的来说，研究人员在一组EXors中推导出了吸积和恒星参数之间的关系。他们发现，当处于爆发状态时，吸积参数几乎不依赖于恒星参数，并且即使在平静时，EXors在积累质量方面也比经典的T Tauri恒星更有效。 <br /><br />总结: 本文介绍了Gaia23bab这颗年轻恒星物体的观测与分析结果。研究发现，它在过去10年内有三次爆发，吸积参数与恒星参数关系的变化特点。研究为我们更好地了解这类恒星提供了重要参考。 <div>
On 2023 March 6, the Gaia telescope alerted a 2 mag burst from Gaia23bab, a young stellar object in the Galactic plane. We observed Gaia23bab with the Large Binocular Telescope obtaining optical and near-infrared spectra close in time to the peak of the burst, and collected all public multiband photometry to reconstruct the historical light curve. The latter shows three bursts in 10 years (2013, 2017, and 2023), whose duration and amplitude are typical of EXor variables. We estimate that, due to the bursts, the mass accumulated on the star is about twice greater than if the source had remained quiescent for the same period of time. Photometric analysis indicates that Gaia23bab is a class II source with age ≲1 Myr, spectral type G3−K0, stellar luminosity ∼4.0 L⊙, and mass ∼1.6 M⊙. The optical/near-infrared spectrum is rich in emission lines. From the analysis of these lines we measured an accretion luminosity and mass accretion rate (Laccburst ∼ 3.7 L⊙, burst ∼ 2.0 × 10−7M⊙ yr−1) consistent with those of EXors. More generally, we derived the relationships between accretion and stellar parameters in a sample of EXors. We find that, when in burst, the accretion parameters become almost independent of the stellar parameters and that EXors, even in quiescence, are more efficient than classical T Tauri stars in assembling mass.

Millimeter and submillimeter observations of continuum linear dust polarization provide insight into dust grain growth in protoplanetary disks, which are the progenitors of planetary systems. We present the results of the first survey of dust polarization in protoplanetary disks at 870 μm and 3 mm. We find that protoplanetary disks in the same molecular cloud at similar evolutionary stages can exhibit different correlations between observing wavelength and polarization morphology and fraction. We explore possible origins for these differences in polarization, including differences in dust populations and protostar properties. For RY Tau and MWC 480, which are consistent with scattering at both wavelengths, we present models of the scattering polarization from several dust grain size distributions. These models aim to reproduce two features of the observational results for these disks: (1) both disks have an observable degree of polarization at both wavelengths; and (2) the polarization fraction is higher at 3 mm than at 870 μm in the centers of the disks. For both disks, these features can be reproduced by a power-law distribution of spherical dust grains with a maximum radius of 200 μm and high optical depth. In MWC 480, we can also reproduce features (1) and (2) with a model containing large grains (amax = 490 μm) near the disk midplane and small grains (amax = 140 μm) above and below the midplane.

<title>First Detection in Space of the High-energy Isomer of Cyanomethanimine: H2CNCN</title>

We report the first detection in the interstellar medium of N-cyanomethanimine (H2CNCN), the stable dimer of HCN of highest energy and the most complex organic molecule identified in space containing the prebiotically relevant NCN backbone. We have identified a plethora of a-type rotational transitions with 3 ≤ Jup ≤ 11 and Ka ≤ 2 that belong to this species toward the Galactic center G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud, the only interstellar source showing the three cyanomethanimine isomers (including the Z- and E-isomers of C-cyanomethanimine, HNCHCN). We have derived a total column density for H2CNCN of (2.9 ± 0.1) × 1012 cm−2, which translates into a total molecular abundance with respect to H2 of (2.1 ± 0.3) × 10−11. We have also revisited the previous detection of E- and Z-HNCHCN and found a total C/N-cyanomethanimine abundance ratio of 31.8 ± 1.8 and a Z/E-HNCHCN ratio of 4.5 ± 0.2. While the latter can be explained on the basis of thermodynamic equilibrium, chemical kinetics are more likely responsible for the observed C/N-cyanomethanimine abundance ratio, where the gas-phase reaction between methanimine (CH2NH) and the cyanogen radical (CN) arises as the primary formation route.

A kilonova, the electromagnetic emission produced by compact binary mergers, is formed through a delicate interplay of physical processes, involving r-process nucleosynthesis and interactions between heavy elements and photons through radiative transfer. This complexity makes it difficult to achieve a comprehensive understanding of kilonova spectra. In this study, we aim to enhance our understanding and establish connections between physical parameters and observables through radiative-transfer simulations. Specifically, we investigate how ejecta temperature and element mass influence the resulting kilonova spectrum. For each species, the strength of its line features depends on these parameters, leading to the formation of a distinct region in the parameter space, dubbed the resonance island, where the line signature of that species is notably evident in the kilonova spectrum. We explore its origin and applications. Among explored r-process elements (31 ≤ Z ≤ 92), we find that four species—SrII, YII, BaII, and CeII—exhibit large and strong resonance islands, suggesting their significant contributions to kilonova spectra at specific wavelengths. In addition, we discuss potential challenges and future perspectives in observable heavy elements and their masses in the context of the resonance island.

<title>The Impact-driven Atmospheric Loss of Super-Earths around Different Spectral Types of Host Stars</title>

A planet’s mass loss is important for the its formation and evolution. The radius valley (RV) is believed to be triggered by evaporation-induced mass loss. As an alternative mechanism for RV, the mass loss of post-impact planets is thoroughly investigated in this work. The impact energy is converted to the planet’s internal energy, enhancing its core energy and accelerating mass loss and orbital migration. As the host star changes from K type to F type, the planet’s mass loss and orbital migration increase. When the initial gas-to-core-mass ratio is small, the migration efficiency for planets around K-type stars will increase, which helps to suppress mass loss and retain the planet’s mass and radius within a specific range. On the contrary, planets around more massive F-type stars experience more substantial mass loss, potentially leading to complete mass loss, and migrate to orbits with longer periods. Our calculation shows that planets around different spectral types of host stars give rise to an RV ranging from 1.3 to 2.0 R⊕, consistent with the observed range of 1.3–2.6 R⊕. Despite the presence of uncertain parameters, the planetesimal impact can promote the RV establishment for planets around host stars of different spectral types.

In this study, we estimate the stellar ages of LAMOST DR8 red giant branch (RGB) stars based on the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm. We used 2643 RGB stars extracted from the APOKASC-2 asteroseismological catalog as the training data set. After selecting the parameters ([α/Fe], [C/Fe], Teff, [N/Fe], [C/H], log g) highly correlated with age using GBDT, we apply the same GBDT method to the new catalog of more than 590,000 stars classified as RGB stars. The test data set shows that the median relative error is around 11.6% for the method. We also compare the predicted ages of RGB stars with other studies (e.g., based on APOGEE) and find some systematic differences. The final uncertainty is about 15%–30% compared to the ages of open clusters. Then, we present the spatial distribution of the RGB sample with an age determination, which could recreate the expected result, and discuss systematic biases. All these diagnostics show that one can apply the GBDT method to other stellar samples to estimate atmospheric parameters and age.

<title>The Role of Stochastic Fermi-type Particle Acceleration in the Inner Jets of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>

High-resolution radio observations of nearby active galactic nuclei have revealed extended, limb-brightened structures in their inner jets. This ties in with other multiwavelength observations from radio to X-ray and gamma ray, indicating that a structured jet model is required. While electrons need to be kept energized to account for the observed features, the underlying particle acceleration mechanism is still unclear. We explore the role of stochastic Fermi-type particle acceleration, i.e., classical second-order Fermi and shear acceleration, for understanding the multiwavelength observations of the inner jets of M87. An analytical Fokker–Planck description is adopted to infer characteristic spectral indices and cutoff energies for these two mechanisms. We focus on electron synchrotron radiation as the dominant emission process. We find that the multiwavelength observations of M87 can be satisfactorily accounted for in a framework, where the X-rays are produced at a larger distance from the core than the radio emission region. This provides further support to multizone, broadband emission modeling. We use our findings to also comment on the acceleration of cosmic rays entrained in the sheath.

Iron line spectroscopy has been one of the leading methods not only for measuring the spins of accreting black holes but also for testing fundamental physics. Basing on such a method, we present an analysis of a data set observed simultaneously by NuSTAR and NICER for the black hole binary candidate MAXI J1803-298, which shows prominent relativistic reflection features. Various relxill_nk flavors are utilized to test the Kerr black hole hypothesis. The results obtained from our analysis provide stringent constraints on Johannsen deformation parameter α13 with the highest precise to date, namely from relxillD_nk and from relxillion_nk, respectively, in 3σ credible lever, where the Johannsen metric reduces to the Kerr metric when α13 vanishes. Furthermore, we investigate the best model fit results using Akaike information criterion and assess its systematic uncertainties.

<title>Intrinsic Emission of PSR B1937+21 at 327 MHz</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
At 327 MHz, the observed emission of PSR B1937+21 is greatly affected by scattering in the interstellar medium, on a timescale of order the pulse period. We use the bright impulsive giant pulses emitted by the pulsar to measure the impulse response of the interstellar medium and then recover the intrinsic emission of the pulsar by deconvolution—revealing fine structure on timescales not normally observable. We find that the intrinsic widths of the main pulse and interpulse in the pulse profile are similar to those measured at higher frequencies. We detect 60,270 giant pulses, which typically appear as narrow, ∼100 ns bursts consisting of one to a few nanoshots with widths ≲ 10 ns. However, about 10% of the giant pulses exhibit multiple bursts that seem to be causally related to each other. We also report the first detection of giant micropulses in PSR B1937+21, primarily associated with the regular main pulse emission. These are distinct from giant pulses not only in the phases at which they occur, but also in their larger widths, of order a microsecond, and steeper energy distribution. These measurements place useful observational constraints on emission mechanisms for giant pulses as well as the regular radio emission of millisecond pulsars.

<title>Mass Flows in Expanding Coronal Loops</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3c3c</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3c3c</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An expansion of the cross-sectional area directly impacts the mass flow along a coronal loop and significantly alters the radiative and hydrodynamic evolution of that loop as a result. Previous studies have found that an area expansion from the chromosphere to the corona significantly lengthens the cooling time of the corona and appears to suppress draining from the corona. In this work, we examine the fluid dynamics to understand how the mass flow rate, the energy balance, and the cooling and draining timescales are affected by a nonuniform area. We find that in loops with moderate or large expansion (cross-sectional area expansion factors of 2, 3, 10, 30, 100 from the photosphere to the apex), impulsive heating, for either direct thermal heating or electron beam heating, induces a steady flow into the corona, so that the coronal density continues to rise during the cooling phase, whereas a uniform loop drains during the cooling phase. The induced upflow carries energy into the corona, balancing the losses from thermal conduction, and continues until thermal conduction weakens enough so that it can no longer support the radiative losses of the transition region. As a result, the plasma cools primarily radiatively until the onset of catastrophic collapse. The speed and duration of the induced upflow both increase in proportion to the rate of area expansion. We argue that observations of blueshifted spectral lines, therefore, could place a constraint on a loop’s area expansion.

<title>Interaction between a Coronal Mass Ejection and Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The interaction between a coronal mass ejection (CME) and a comet has been observed several times by in situ observations from the Rosetta Plasma Consortium, which is designed to investigate the cometary magnetosphere of comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko (CG). Goetz et al. reported a magnetic field of up to 300 nT measured in the inner coma, which is among the largest interplanetary magnetic fields observed in the solar system. They suggested the large magnetic field observations in the inner coma come from magnetic field pileup regions, which are generated by the interaction between a CME and/or corotating interaction region and the cometary magnetosphere. However, the detailed interaction between a CME and the cometary magnetosphere of comet CG in the inner coma has not been investigated by numerical simulations yet. In this paper, we will use a numerical model to simulate the interaction between comet CG and a Halloween class CME and investigate its magnetospheric response to the CME. We find that the plasma structures change significantly during the CME event, and the maximum value of the magnetic field strength is more than 500 nT close to the nucleus. Virtual satellites at similar distances as Rosetta show that the magnetic field strength can be as large as 250 nT, which is slightly less than what Goetz et al. reported.

<title>JWST Photometric Time-delay and Magnification Measurements for the Triply Imaged Type Ia “SN H0pe” at z = 1.78</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Supernova (SN) SN H0pe is a gravitationally lensed, triply imaged, Type Ia SN (SN Ia) discovered in James Webb Space Telescope imaging of the PLCK G165.7+67.0 cluster of galaxies. Well-observed multiply imaged SNe provide a rare opportunity to constrain the Hubble constant (H0), by measuring the relative time delay between the images and modeling the foreground mass distribution. SN H0pe is located at z = 1.783 and is the first SN Ia with sufficient light-curve sampling and long enough time delays for an H0 inference. Here we present photometric time-delay measurements and SN properties of SN H0pe. Using JWST/NIRCam photometry, we measure time delays of Δtab = observer-frame days and Δtcb = observer-frame days relative to the last image to arrive (image 2b; all uncertainties are 1σ), which corresponds to a ∼5.6% uncertainty contribution for H0 assuming 70 km s−1 Mpc−1. We also constrain the absolute magnification of each image to μa = , μb = , μc = by comparing the observed peak near-IR magnitude of SN H0pe to the nonlensed population of SNe Ia.

<title>Mass Ejection Driven by Sudden Energy Deposition in Stellar Envelopes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A number of stellar astrophysical phenomena, such as tidal novae and planetary engulfment, involve sudden injection of subbinding energy in a thin layer within the star, leading to mass ejection of the stellar envelope. We use a 1D hydrodynamical model to survey the stellar response and mass loss for various amounts (Edep) and locations of the energy deposition. We find that the total mass ejection has a nontrivial dependence on Edep due to the varying strengths of mass ejection events, which are associated with density/pressure waves breaking out from the stellar surface. The rapid occurrence of multiple breakouts may present a unique observational signature for sudden envelope heating events in stars.

<div> 关键词: 快速无线电爆发，DSA-110，FRB，星系，星形成<br />
总结: <br />这篇文章介绍了快速无线电爆发（FRBs）以及通过DSA-110发现的首批FRBs和它们的宿主星系。通过关联FRBs和宿主星系，研究人员得以测量内在和环境特性，测试FRB起源模型，并将它们用作遥远宇宙气体的精确探测器。该样本包括11个FRBs，是迄今为止最大、最统一的本地化FRB样本，选择标准基于Pan-STARRS1的光学成像识别出的宿主星系。大多数宿主星系正在经历星形成，与之前的FRB宿主相类似。然而，这一样本中有两个宿主星系是巨大而平静的星系。星系样本的星形成历史分布显示出宽广的延迟时间分布，需通过与老年恒星群体相关的一个或多个祖代星体形成渠道的存在，例如致密天体的双星演化。 <br /> <div>
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a powerful and mysterious new class of transients that are luminous enough to be detected at cosmological distances. By associating FRBs to host galaxies, we can measure intrinsic and environmental properties that test FRB origin models, in addition to using them as precise probes of distant cosmic gas. The Deep Synoptic Array (DSA-110) is a radio interferometer built to maximize the rate at which it can simultaneously detect and localize FRBs. Here, we present the first sample of FRBs and host galaxies discovered by the DSA-110. This sample of 11 FRBs is the largest, most uniform sample of localized FRBs to date, as it is selected based on association with host galaxies identified in optical imaging by Pan-STARRS1. These FRBs have not been observed to repeat, and their radio properties (dispersion, temporal scattering, energy) are similar to that of the known nonrepeating FRB population. Most host galaxies have ongoing star formation, as has been identified before for FRB hosts. Two hosts of the new sample are massive, quiescent galaxies. The distribution of star formation history across this host-galaxy sample shows that the delay time distribution is wide, with a power-law model that spans from ∼100 Myr to ≳2 Gyr. This requires the existence of one or more progenitor formation channels associated with old stellar populations, such as the binary evolution of compact objects.

<div> 关键词: baryons, fast radio bursts (FRBs), feedback, ionized baryons, simulations<br />
<br />总结: 该研究利用快速射电暴(FRBs)测量电子色散测量，以解决遗失的重子问题并约束宇宙中的反馈历史。通过分析三种模拟套件中的183个模型，发现它们在预测上存在显著差异，主要是由于反馈实现的不同。其中SIMBA的反馈最强，Astrid的反馈最弱，而IllustrisTNG对超新星反馈最敏感。研究发现，黑洞而不是恒星最有能力重新分布宇宙中和星系周围的重子物质。这些统计数据为利用FRBs约束星系形成和演化的物理学奠定了基础。 <br /> <div>
Most diffuse baryons, including the circumgalactic medium (CGM) surrounding galaxies and the intergalactic medium (IGM) in the cosmic web, remain unmeasured and unconstrained. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) offer an unparalleled method to measure the electron dispersion measures (DMs) of ionized baryons. Their distribution can resolve the missing baryon problem and constrain the history of feedback theorized to impart significant energy to the CGM and IGM. We analyze the Cosmology and Astrophysics with Machine Learning Simulations using three suites, IllustrisTNG, SIMBA, and Astrid, each varying six parameters (two cosmological and four astrophysical feedback), for a total of 183 distinct simulation models. We find significantly different predictions between the fiducial models of the suites owing to their different implementations of feedback. SIMBA exhibits the strongest feedback, leading to the smoothest distribution of baryons and reducing the sight-line-to-sight-line variance in DMs between z = 0 and 1. Astrid has the weakest feedback and the largest variance. We calculate FRB CGM measurements as a function of galaxy impact parameter, with SIMBA showing the weakest DMs due to aggressive active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback and Astrid the strongest. Within each suite, the largest differences are due to varying AGN feedback. IllustrisTNG shows the most sensitivity to supernova feedback, but this is due to the change in the AGN feedback strengths, demonstrating that black holes, not stars, are most capable of redistributing baryons in the IGM and CGM. We compare our statistics directly to recent observations, paving the way for the use of FRBs to constrain the physics of galaxy formation and evolution.

<div> 关键词: 贝叶斯合成, 超大质量黑洞, 多波段数据, 天体测量, 计算机模拟

总结:
贝叶斯合成是一种潜在的方法，可以从不同仪器的多波段数据中提取出超大质量黑洞的轨道参数和各自的光变曲线。未来的干涉仪将可以观测到质量较大的超大质量黑洞的星震。结合这些观测数据和来自调查项目如Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time的定期变化时域数据，可以比独立的观测方法提供更多有关超大质量黑洞候选者的信息。该方法可以从长期、中期和短期的二进制动力学和观测配置中可靠地确定二进制参数和组分流量，假设每年进行10次观测，即使在“q-accrete”类型的短周期物体中也适用。从二进制动力学参数构建的预期超大质量黑洞星震可能有助于改进超大质量黑洞的观测策略。推断的质量比、二进制组分的光变曲线和观测到的光心星震组合可以成为超大质量黑洞组分活动状态的代理。 <div>
We test the potential of Bayesian synthesis of upcoming multi-instrument data to extract orbital parameters and individual light curves of close binary supermassive black holes (CB-SMBH) with subparsec separations. Next-generation interferometers, will make possible the observation of astrometric wobbles in CB-SMBH. Combining them with periodic variable time-domain data from surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time, allows for more information on CB-SMBH candidates compared to standalone observational methods. Our method reliably determines binary parameters and component fluxes from binary total flux across long-term, intermediate, and short-term binary dynamics and observational configurations, assuming 10 annual observations, even in short period “q-accrete” objects. Expected CB-SMBH astrometric wobbles constructed from binary dynamical parameters might serve in refining observational strategies for CB-SMBH. Combination of inferred mass ratio, light curves of binary components, and observed photocenter wobbles can be a proxy for the activity states of CB-SMBH components.

在这篇文章中，研究人员对红移为6.6-13.2的53个星系进行了Lyα发射的演化研究，并发现其中有15个星系在3σ水平上显示了Lyα发射。通过对这些星系的Lyα当量宽度测量和严格的3σ上限限制，研究人员认为Lyα发射的EW随着红移的增加而统计上减小。然后，他们利用贝叶斯推断框架基于Lyα当量宽度的红移演化和宇宙再电离模拟结果评估中性氢分数，得出在z∼7，8和9-13处的xH I分别小于0.79、和，这些相对较大的xH I值与Planck宇宙微波背景光学深度测量和先前从星系和类星体Lyα阻尼翼吸收中得出的xH I约束一致，并强烈表明晚期再电离历史。这样的晚期再电离历史表明，再电离的主要来源会比较晚出现，并由相对于被广泛接受的少量低质量对象再电离来源图像的中等质量暗物质晕组织。 <br /><br />总结: 这项研究对红移为6.6-13.2的53个星系进行了Lyα发射的演化研究，发现15个星系显示了Lyα发射，在红移增加时Lyα的当量宽度统计上减小。根据再电离模拟结果，他们评估了中性氢分数，结果表明晚期再电离历史，这暗示再电离的主要来源会比较晚出现。 <div>
We present the evolution of Lyα emission derived from 53 galaxies at z = 6.6–13.2, which have been identified by multiple JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy programs of Early Release Science, General Observer, Director's Discretionary Time, and Guaranteed Time Observations. These galaxies fall on the star formation main sequence and are typical star-forming galaxies with UV magnitudes of −22.5 ≤ MUV ≤ −17.0. We find that 15 out of 53 galaxies show Lyα emission at the >3σ level, and we obtain Lyα equivalent width (EW) measurements and stringent 3σ upper limits for the 15 and 38 galaxies, respectively. Confirming that Lyα velocity offsets and line widths of our galaxies are comparable to those of low-redshift Lyα emitters, we investigate the redshift evolution of the Lyα EW. We find that Lyα EWs statistically decrease toward high redshifts on the Lyα EW versus the MUV plane for various probability distributions of the uncertainties. We then evaluate neutral hydrogen fractions xH I with the redshift evolution of the Lyα EW and the cosmic reionization simulation results on the basis of a Bayesian inference framework, and obtain xH I < 0.79, , and at z ∼ 7, 8, and 9–13, respectively. These moderately large xH I values are consistent with the Planck cosmic microwave background optical depth measurement and previous xH I constraints from galaxy and QSO Lyα damping wing absorption and strongly indicate a late reionization history. Such a late reionization history suggests that major sources of reionization would emerge late and be hosted by moderately massive halos compared with the widely accepted picture of abundant low-mass objects for the sources of reionization.

The High Altitude Detection of Astronomical Radiation (HADAR) is a novel wide-field Cherenkov Telescope. It is designed for gamma-ray astronomy in the energy range of 10 GeV to 100 TeV, with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) being one of its primary research focuses. To assess its complementary capabilities, this study first presents the Crab sensitivity of HADAR. Then, to compare the sensitivity of GRBs, the observation time for all experiments is standardized to 100 s. To clearly demonstrate HADAR’s advantages, we estimate its observational results with a 221009A-like GRB. The study found that HADAR is capable of more comprehensively recording the bending and absorption of self-Compton radiation, which is expected to fill observational gaps in space- and ground-based experiments. We anticipate that this facility will ensure a large statistical GRB sample and advance our understanding of GRBs.

总结:<br />研究关于 z = 7.54 明亮类星体ULAS J1342+0928的1.1Mpc²环境。使用HST进行深度成像，发现一个与类星体相距223kpc的LBG。对之前ALMA发现的一个[C ii]辐射体未发现HST对应体。LBG候选体的完整性估计结果表明，>50% z ∼ 7.5 LBGs被忽视，由于F105W缺少Lyman断裂红边滤波器。通过QSO-LBG聚类分析，发现此类星体的LBG过度需求较低，与平均或低密度的领域一致。最后，鉴定两个LBG候选体的zphot与类星体视线上一个已确认的z = 6.84吸收体匹配。所有这些星系候选体都是进一步观测的极好目标，以确认它们的红移和物理特性。 <div>
Theoretical models predict that z ≳ 6 quasars are hosted in the most massive halos of the underlying dark matter distribution and thus would be immersed in protoclusters of galaxies. However, observations report inconclusive results. We investigate the 1.1 proper-Mpc2 environment of the z = 7.54 luminous quasar ULAS J1342+0928. We search for Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) candidates using deep imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS)/F814W, Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3)/F105W/F125W bands, and Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera at 3.6 and 4.5 μm. We report a LBG with magF125W = 26.41 at 223 projected proper kpc (pkpc) from the quasar. We find no HST counterpart to one [C ii] emitter previously found with the Atacama Large millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 27 projected pkpc and z[C II]=7.5341 ± 0.0009 (Venemans et al. 2020). We estimate the completeness of our LBG candidates using results from Cosmic Assembly Near-Infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey/GOODS deep blank field searches sharing a similar filter setup. We find that >50% of the z ∼ 7.5 Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) with magF125W > 25.5 are missed due to the absence of a filter redward of the Lyman break in F105W, hindering the UV color accuracy of the candidates. We conduct a QSO-LBG clustering analysis revealing a low LBG excess of in this quasar field, consistent with an average or low-density field. Consequently, this result does not present strong evidence of an LBG overdensity around ULAS J1342+0928. Furthermore, we identify two LBG candidates with a zphot matching a confirmed z = 6.84 absorber along the line of sight to the quasar. All these galaxy candidates are excellent targets for follow-up observations with JWST and/or ALMA to confirm their redshift and physical properties.

The gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB 211211A is believed to have occurred due to the merger of two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole, despite its duration of more than a minute. Subsequent analysis has revealed numerous interesting properties including the possible presence of a ∼22 Hz quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) during precursor emission. Here we perform timing analysis of Fermi and Swift gamma-ray data on GRB 211211A and, although we do not find a strong QPO during the precursor, we do find an extremely significant 19.5 Hz flux oscillation, which has higher fractional amplitude at higher energies, in a ∼0.2 s segment beginning ∼1.6 s after the start of the burst. After presenting our analysis we discuss possible mechanisms for the oscillation.

<div> 磁流体动力学湍流、AGN、吸积盘、X射线重照、时间延迟

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了活跃星系核（AGN）吸积盘中的磁流体动力学湍流对温度波动的影响，指出这些波动会导致吸积盘不均匀性，并与一些塞弗特1型AGN的连续反应映射结果不符。研究还表明X射线重照模型中的时间延迟与磁流体动力学湍流有关，并且应该在模拟中加以考虑。此外，文章还提到了X射线和盘发射之间的交叉相关性较弱，与最近的连续反应映射结果一致。 <div>
Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence can drive significant temperature fluctuations in the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). As a result, the disk can be highly inhomogeneous and has a half-light radius larger than the static Shakura and Sunyaev disk (SSD), in agreement with quasar microlensing observations. Meanwhile, the accretion-disk sizes can also be determined using continuum reverberation mappings that measure interband cross-correlations and time lags. The interband time lags are often understood in the X-ray reprocessing scenario. Here we show that the interband continuum time lags of the X-ray reprocessing of an inhomogeneous disk are similar to or even smaller than those of a static SSD. Consequently, the X-ray reprocessing of an inhomogeneous disk cannot account for the recent continuum reverberation mappings of some Seyfert 1 AGNs, whose measured time lags are larger than those of a static SSD. In contrast to the tight correlation between UV/optical variations, the cross-correlation between X-ray and disk emission is rather weak in this model; this behavior is consistent with recent continuum reverberation mappings. Moreover, the time lags in this model are anticorrelated with the amplitude of disk temperature fluctuations. Our results suggest that the temperature fluctuations should be properly considered when modeling interband continuum time lags.

<div> circumbinary accretion, mass ratio, disk thickness, viscosity, inspirals
总结:<br /><br />
这篇文章对环双星吸积盘进行了广泛的研究，研究了质量比从0.01到1的循环二进制系统。他们发现，质量比较低的二进制系统会导致减速运动，而在一些情况下，吸积盘会产生偏心模式，加速二进制系统的合并过程。研究还表明，粘度对副星的优先吸积程度产生重要影响，解决了以前研究的不一致之处。冷的环双星吸积盘即使在质量比约为0.01时仍保持着偏心性，并维持着深远的不对称空洞。黑洞吸积的变化与盘的偏心性相关，即使在质量比为0.01时也观察到了10%以上的变化。 <div>
Circumbinary accretion occurs throughout the universe, from the formation of stars and planets to the aftermath of major galactic mergers. We present an extensive investigation of circumbinary accretion disks, studying circular binaries with mass ratios (q ≡ M2/M1) from 0.01 to 1 and at each mass ratio probing the effects of disk thickness and viscosity. We study disks with aspect ratios H/r ∈ {0.1, 0.05, 0.03} and vary both the magnitude and spatial dependence of viscosity. Although thin accretion disks have previously been found to promote rapid inspirals of equal-mass binaries, we find that gravitational torques become weaker at lower mass ratios and most binaries with 0.01 ≤ q ≤ 0.04 outspiral, which may delay the coalescence of black hole binaries formed from minor mergers and cause high-mass exoplanets to migrate outward. However, in a number of cases, the disks accreting onto binaries with mass ratios ∼0.07 fail to develop eccentric modes, leading to extremely rapid inspirals. Variability in black hole accretion correlates with disk eccentricity, and we observe variability above the ∼10% level even for mass ratios of 0.01. We demonstrate that the spatial dependence of the viscosity (e.g., α vs. constant ν) significantly affects the degree of preferential accretion onto the secondary, resolving discrepancies between previous studies. Colder circumbinary disks remain eccentric even at q ∼ 0.01 and sustain deep, asymmetric cavities.

<div> 太阳，纳米耀斑，等离子发射，模拟，太阳活动监测

总结: 本研究通过模拟纳米耀斑加热等离子体的辐射，以太阳观测卫星的数据验证了这一模拟结果。研究结果显示，通过分析太阳观测卫星的数据，可以推断出纳米耀斑的存在及其加热频率。太阳观测卫星数据显示，在研究的X射线明亮点的观测中，平均延迟时间为1500-3000秒的纳米耀斑分布能够很好地匹配观测到的发射。此外，研究还发现，Marshall Grazing Incidence X-ray Spectrometer (MaGIXS) 和X射线望远镜（XRT）对于诊断加热频率具有很高的灵敏度，而太阳动力学观测卫星（SDO）上的大气成像组件（AIA）的波段对此的灵敏度最低。 <div>
Nanoflares are thought to be one of the prime candidates that can heat the solar corona to its multimillion kelvin temperature. Individual nanoflares are difficult to detect with the present generation of instruments, but their presence can be inferred by comparing simulated nanoflare-heated plasma emissions with the observed emission. Using HYDRAD coronal loop simulations, we model the emission from an X-ray bright point (XBP) observed by the Marshall Grazing Incidence X-ray Spectrometer (MaGIXS), along with the nearest available observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) on board the Hinode observatory. The length and magnetic field strength of the coronal loops are derived from the linear force-free extrapolation of the observed photospheric magnetogram by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board SDO. Each loop is assumed to be heated by random nanoflares, whose magnitude and frequency are determined by the loop length and magnetic field strength. The simulation results are then compared and matched against the measured intensity from AIA, XRT, and MaGIXS. Our model results indicate the observed emission from the XBP under study could be well matched by a distribution of nanoflares with average delay times 1500–3000 s. Further, we demonstrate the high sensitivity of MaGIXS and XRT for diagnosing the heating frequency using this method, while AIA passbands are found to be the least sensitive.

<div> 关键词: 近红外光度测量, JAGB 方法, TRGB 方法, 高对称性的JAGB星光度函数, 星系距离测量 
总结: 本研究使用近红外JHK光度测量了13个附近星系的恒星群。使用JAGB方法和TRGB方法测量了各星系的距离，并通过比较两种方法的残差验证了其可靠性。最终的JAGB星光度函数显示出高度对称的高斯分布特征。这项研究为星系距离测量提供了新的方法，并为恒星群的研究提供了宝贵的数据。 <div>
We present near-infrared JHK photometry for the resolved stellar populations in 13 nearby galaxies: NGC 6822, IC 1613, NGC 3109, Sextans B, Sextans A, NGC 300, NGC 55, NGC 7793, NGC 247, NGC 5253, Cen A, NGC 1313, and M83, acquired from the 6.5 m Baade–Magellan telescope. We measure distances to each galaxy using the J-region asymptotic giant branch (JAGB) method, a new standard candle that leverages the constant luminosities of color-selected, carbon-rich AGB stars. While only single-epoch, random-phase photometry is necessary to derive JAGB distances, our photometry is time-averaged over multiple epochs, thereby decreasing the contribution of the JAGB stars’ intrinsic variability to the measured dispersions in their observed luminosity functions. To cross-validate these distances, we also measure near-infrared tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distances to these galaxies. The residuals obtained from subtracting the distance moduli from the two methods yield an rms scatter of σJAGB−TRGB = ±0.07 mag. Therefore, all systematics in the JAGB method and TRGB method (e.g., crowding, differential reddening, star formation histories) must be contained within these ±0.07 mag bounds for this sample of galaxies because the JAGB and TRGB distance indicators are drawn from entirely distinct stellar populations and are thus affected by these systematics independently. Finally, the composite JAGB star luminosity function formed from this diverse sample of galaxies is well described by a Gaussian function with a modal value of MJ = –6.20 ± 0.003 mag (stat), indicating that the underlying JAGB star luminosity function of a well-sampled full star formation history is highly symmetric and Gaussian based on over 6700 JAGB stars in the composite sample.

<div> 关键词: 暗物质，宇宙学，模拟，星系，粒子物理
总结:
本文使用了宇宙学水动力学缩放模拟探索了类似于银河系的星系中含有原子暗物质（ADM）的亚哈洛的特性。ADM由于具有能量耗散而不同于冷暗物质（CDM），这源于自相互作用。采用了GIZMO进行模拟，并利用了标准模型的巴里物质所采用的FIRE-2星系形成物理机制。ADM气体能有效冷却并塌缩到亚哈洛的中心，增加了亚哈洛的中心密度并影响其轨道。具有卫星星系的亚哈洛子集具有更尖锐的密度剖面和较小的恒星半质量半径。在ADM模拟中产生的矮星系总体上比CDM模拟中的更紧凑，无法复制观测到的矮星系结构的整个多样性。此外，还确定了一群高度紧凑的亚哈洛，几乎完全由ADM组成，并且形成在宿主的中心区域，在那里它们能留下清晰的痕迹。这项工作首次对强耗散暗物质情景中的亚哈洛特性进行了详细探讨，为其他ADM参数空间的以及其他暗物质模型对星系观测可观的影响提供了直觉。 <div>
Using cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations, we explore the properties of subhalos in Milky Way analogs that contain a subcomponent of atomic dark matter (ADM). ADM differs from cold dark matter (CDM) due to the presence of self-interactions that lead to energy dissipation, analogous to standard model baryons. This model can arise in dark sectors that are natural and theoretically motivated extensions to the standard model. The simulations used in this work were carried out using GIZMO and utilize the FIRE-2 galaxy formation physics in the standard model baryonic sector. For the parameter points we consider, the ADM gas cools efficiently, allowing it to collapse to the center of subhalos. This increases a subhalo’s central density and affects its orbit, with more subhalos surviving small pericentric passages. The subset of subhalos that host satellite galaxies have cuspier density profiles and smaller stellar half-mass radii relative to CDM. The entire population of dwarf galaxies produced in the ADM simulations is more compact than those seen in CDM simulations, unable to reproduce the entire diversity of observed dwarf galaxy structures. Additionally, we also identify a population of highly compact subhalos that consist nearly entirely of ADM and form in the central region of the host, where they can leave distinctive imprints in the baryonic disk. This work presents the first detailed exploration of subhalo properties in a strongly dissipative dark matter scenario, providing intuition for how other regions of ADM parameter space, as well as other dark sector models, would impact galactic-scale observables.

总结: 本文总结了加利福尼亚超新星项目（CSP）的第一和第二阶段所获得的Ia型超新星（SNe Ia）的光学光谱观测数据，共包括148个光谱和30个SNe Ia的CSP-I阶段观测，以及234个光谱和127个SNe Ia的CSP-II阶段观测。此外，还总结了46个历史SNe Ia的216个光学光谱数据，其中包括了加利亚/托洛洛超新星调查观测的30个SNe Ia的53个光谱。并且将这些数据与之前发表的CSP数据和公开数据相结合，总结出232个CSP和历史SNe Ia的光谱参数测量样本。最后，分析了光谱和光度特性之间的最强相关性，并定义了有针对性和无针对性搜索发现的SNe Ia样本。结果显示，在有针对性的搜索中，更多属于冷、宽线分支亚型的SNe Ia，浅硅SNe Ia在两个样本中频率相似，而核心正常SNe Ia在无针对性搜索中更为频繁。  <div>
We present the second and final release of optical spectroscopy of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) obtained during the first and second phases of the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP-I and CSP-II). The newly released data consist of 148 spectra of 30 SNe Ia observed in the course of CSP-I and 234 spectra of 127 SNe Ia obtained during CSP-II. We also present 216 optical spectra of 46 historical SNe Ia, including 53 spectra of 30 SNe Ia observed by the Calán/Tololo Supernova Survey. We combine these observations with previously published CSP data and publicly available spectra to compile a large sample of measurements of spectroscopic parameters at maximum light, consisting of pseudo-equivalent widths and expansion velocities of selected features for 232 CSP and historical SNe Ia (including more than 1000 spectra). Finally, we review some of the strongest correlations between spectroscopic and photometric properties of SNe Ia. Specifically, we define two samples: one consisting of SNe Ia discovered by targeted searches (most of them CSP-I objects) and the other composed of SNe Ia discovered by untargeted searches, which includes most of the CSP-II objects. The analyzed correlations are similar for both samples. We find a larger incidence of SNe Ia belonging to the cool and broad-line Branch subtypes among the events discovered by targeted searches, shallow-silicon SNe Ia are present with similar frequencies in both samples, while core normal SNe Ia are more frequent in untargeted searches.

Large amplitude Alfvénic fluctuations, sometimes leading to localized inversions of the magnetic field, called switchbacks, are a common but poorly understood phenomenon in the solar wind. In particular, their origin(s), evolution, and stability within solar wind conditions are yet to be fully understood. Simulations modeling switchbacks have previously studied their stability in 2D. Here, we investigate the decay process of Alfvén wave packets via MHD simulations in 3D by characterizing the effects of system size, aspect ratio, and propagation angle on the decay rate. We show that the initial wave packet is unstable to parametric instabilities that develop compressible and Alfvénic secondary modes in the plane of, and transverse to, the initial wave packet propagation direction. The growth of transverse modes, absent in 2D simulations, increases the decay rate of the wave packet. We finally discuss the implications of our results for lifetime estimates of switchbacks and wave energy conversion in the solar wind.

We report the detection of the ordered alignment between the magnetic field and kpc-scale bubbles in the nearby spiral galaxy, NGC 628. Applying the Velocity Gradient Technique on CO spectroscopic data from the ALMA-PHANGS, the magnetic field of NGC 628 is measured at the scale of 191 pc (∼4″). The large-scale magnetic field is oriented parallel to the spiral arms and curves around the galactic bubble structures in the mid-infrared emission observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. A total of 21 bubble structures have been identified at the edges of spiral arms with scales over 300 pc, which includes two kpc-scale structures. These bubbles are caused by supernova remnants and prolonged star formation and are similar to the outflow chimneys found in neutral hydrogen in galactic disks. At the edge of the bubbles, the shocks traced by the O iii emission present a curved magnetic field that parallels the bubble’s shell. The magnetic field follows the bubble expansion and binds the gas in the shell to trigger further star formation. By analyzing the larger sample of 1694 bubbles, we found a distinct radial-size distribution of bubbles in NGC 628 indicating the star formation history in the galaxy.

<div> 超长周期无线电暂现现象, 磁化中子星, 回落盘, 自旋演化, 初始质量吸积率

总结:
这项研究通过模拟发现，磁星和回落盘模型可以解释超长周期无线电暂现现象的周期、周期导数和X射线亮度。J1627可能处于准自旋平衡阶段，需要回落盘的初始质量吸积率和磁场在一定范围内。在回落盘的活跃寿命内，J1839不可能达到观测到的周期导数的上限，因此可能处于回落盘失活后的第二喷射相。具有(2–6) × 1014 G的磁场和初始质量吸积率为∼1024–1026 g s−1的回落盘可能是J1839的可能前体。 <div>
Recently, two ultralong-period radio transients, GLEAM-X J162759.5-523504.3 (J1627) and GPM J1839-10 (J1839), were discovered with spin periods longer than 1000 s. The origin of these two ultralong-period radio transients is intriguing in understanding the spin evolution of neutron stars (NSs). In this work, we examine whether the interaction between strong magnetized NSs and fallback disks can spin NSs down to the observed ultralong period. Our simulations found that the magnetar + fallback disk model can account for the observed period, period derivative, and X-ray luminosity of J1627 in the quasi-spin-equilibrium stage. To evolve to the current state of J1627, the initial mass-accretion rate of the fallback disk and the magnetic field of the NS are in the range of (1.1–30) × 1024 g s−1 and (2–5) × 1014 G, respectively. In the active lifetime of the fallback disk, it is impossible for J1839 to achieve the observed upper limit of the period derivative. Therefore, we propose that J1839 may be in the second ejector phase after the fallback disk becomes inactive. Those NSs with a magnetic field of (2–6) × 1014 G and a fallback disk with an initial mass-accretion rate of ∼1024–1026 g s−1 are possible progenitors of J1839.

<div> PAC approach, spectroscopic surveys, photometric surveys, excess surface density, subhalo abundance-matching method
<br />总结:
研究利用PAC方法，在红移0.8 < zs < 1.0的夸asar周围测量了相邻星系的过量表面密度，得出这些密度随着距离减小急剧增加。通过亚暗物质丰度匹配方法，可以准确地对小尺度和大尺度的数据进行建模。研究发现，大部分夸asar应该是大质量暗物质中的卫星，而且大尺度环境对夸asar活动影响不大。高卫星比例表明暗物质几乎具有相同的概率来容纳夸asar，而大尺度环境对夸asar活动影响不大。另外，尽管卫星比例很高，但每个大质量暗物质平均不会容纳多于一个卫星夸asar，这也是夸asar稀疏的原因。 <div>
The Photometric objects Around Cosmic webs (PAC) approach developed in Xu et al. has the advantage of making full use of spectroscopic and deeper photometric surveys. With the merits of PAC, the excess surface density of neighboring galaxies can be measured down to stellar mass 1010.80M⊙ around quasars at redshift 0.8 < zs < 1.0, with the data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Imaging Surveys. We find that generally increases quite steeply with the decrease of the separation. Using the subhalo abundance-matching method, we can accurately model the both on small and large scales. We show that the steep increase of toward the quasars requires that a large fraction of quasars should be satellites in massive halos, and we find that this fraction measurement is insensitive to the assumptions of our modeling. This high satellite fraction indicates that the subhalos have nearly the same probability of hosting quasars as the halos for the same (infall) halo mass and that the large-scale environment has negligible effect on the quasar activity. We show that even with this high satellite fraction, each massive halo on average does not host more than one satellite quasar, due to the sparsity of quasars.

We characterize the Magellanic Corona, the warm gaseous halo around the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The Corona is a key ingredient in the formation of the Magellanic Stream and has recently been observed in high-ion absorption around the LMC. In this work, we present a suite of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations to constrain its total mass and temperature prior to the infall of the Magellanic Clouds to our Galaxy. We find that the LMC is able to host a stable Corona before and during its approach to the MW through to the present day. With a Magellanic Corona of >2 × 109M⊙ at 3 × 105 K, our simulations can reproduce the observed total mass of the neutral and ionized components of the Trailing Stream, the size of the LMC disk, the ionization fractions along the Stream, the morphology of the neutral gas, and the on-sky extent of the ionized gas. The Corona plays an integral role in the survival, morphology, and composition of the Magellanic Clouds and the Trailing Stream.

这篇文章报告了关于SPT0418−47的望远镜观测，包括JWST和ALMA的成像观测。SPT0418−47包括一个红移为z=4.225的强透镜星际尘埃星系和一个相关的多重成像伴星系。使用JWST NIRCam和MIRI进行的观测提供了对SPT0418A和SPT0418B两个星系中恒星光的稳健多波段检测，而ALMA对[C ii]发射的检测证实了SPT0418B与SPT0418A处于相同的红移。两个星系的投影物理间隔被推断为4.42±0.05千秒差距。我们推导出SPT0418A和SPT0418B的总放大率分别为μ=29±1和μ=4.1±0.7。我们使用prospector和cigale推导了恒星质量，发现SPT0418A的恒星质量为M* = 1.5±0.3×1010M⊙。SPT0418A和SPT0418B的恒星质量比约为4至7。我们观察到与SPT0418A相关的伸展结构，暗示着一种潮汐特征。这些特征以及接近的投影距离表明该系统正在相互作用。有趣的是，这两个星系的星形成速率和恒星质量与这个时期的星系的主序一致，表明这种持续的相互作用并没有明显提升星形成水平。
<br /><br />总结: SPT0418−47是一个包括主星系和伴星系的强透镜系统，通过JWST和ALMA的成像观测得出了两个星系的物理特性和恒星质量比。两个星系的相互作用导致了伸展结构的出现，但并没有明显提升星形成水平。 <div>
We present JWST and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) imaging for the lensing system SPT0418−47, which includes a strongly lensed, dusty, star-forming galaxy at redshift z = 4.225 and an associated multiply imaged companion. The JWST NIRCam and MIRI imaging observations presented in this paper were acquired as part of the Early Release Science program Targeting Extremely Magnified Panchromatic Lensed Arcs and Their Extended Star formation (TEMPLATES). This data set provides robust mutiwavelength detections of stellar light in both the main (SPT0418A) and companion (SPT0418B) galaxies, while the ALMA detection of [C ii] emission confirms that SPT0418B lies at the same redshift as SPT0418A. We infer that the projected physical separation of the two galaxies is 4.42 ± 0.05 kpc. We derive total magnifications of μ = 29 ± 1 and μ = 4.1 ± 0.7 for SPT0418A and SPT0418B, respectively. We use both prospector and cigale to derive stellar masses. We find that SPT0418A has a stellar mass of from prospector or M* = 1.5 ± 0.3 × 1010M⊙ from cigale. The stellar mass ratio of SPT0418A and SPT0418B is roughly between 4 and 7 ( for prospector and 7.5 ± 3.7 for cigale). We see evidence of extended structure associated with SPT0418A that is suggestive of a tidal feature. These features, along with the close projected proximity, imply that the system is interacting. Interestingly, the star formation rates and stellar masses of both galaxies are consistent with the main sequence of star-forming galaxies at this epoch, indicating that this ongoing interaction has not noticeably elevated the star formation levels.

总结:<br />
本文评估了Legacy Survey of Space and Time科学管道的差异图像分析（DIA）在模拟图像上的表现。通过向图像中的星系添加合成源，以评估管道对Dark Energy Science Collaboration数据挑战2图像的注入合成源的恢复情况。管道的性能良好，效率和流量准确性与输入图像的信噪比一致。我们探讨了Alard-Lupton多项式高斯图像减法核的不同空间自由度，并分析了效率与伪迹率之间的权衡。增加核的空间自由度可以降低伪迹率而不损失效率。不同核空间自由度的流量测量是一致的。我们还提供了一组DIA标志，可以从DIA源表中实质性地过滤出伪迹。我们探讨了观察到的剩余减法伪迹的形态和可能的起源，并建议考虑到这些伪迹起源的复杂性，可能需要使用具有空间变化的一组灵活基础的卷积核来进一步改进。 <div>
We evaluate the performance of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time Science Pipelines Difference Image Analysis (DIA) on simulated images. By adding synthetic sources to galaxies on images, we trace the recovery of injected synthetic sources to evaluate the pipeline on images from the Dark Energy Science Collaboration Data Challenge 2. The pipeline performs well, with efficiency and flux accuracy consistent with the signal-to-noise ratio of the input images. We explore different spatial degrees of freedom for the Alard–Lupton polynomial-Gaussian image subtraction kernel and analyze for trade-offs in efficiency versus artifact rate. Increasing the kernel spatial degrees of freedom reduces the artifact rate without loss of efficiency. The flux measurements with different kernel spatial degrees of freedom are consistent. We also here provide a set of DIA flags that substantially filter out artifacts from the DIA source table. We explore the morphology and possible origins of the observed remaining subtraction artifacts and suggest that given the complexity of these artifact origins, a convolution kernel with a set of flexible bases with spatial variation may be needed to yield further improvements.

This paper presents a fully multidimensional kernel-based reconstruction scheme for finite volume methods applied to systems of hyperbolic conservation laws, with a particular emphasis on the compressible Euler equations. Nonoscillatory reconstruction is achieved through an adaptive-order weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO) method cast into a form suited to multidimensional reconstruction. A kernel-based approach inspired by radial basis functions and Gaussian process modeling, which we call kernel-based finite volume method with WENO, is presented here. This approach allows the creation of a scheme of arbitrary order of accuracy with simply defined multidimensional stencils and substencils. Furthermore, the fully multidimensional nature of the reconstruction allows for a more straightforward extension to higher spatial dimensions and removes the need for complicated boundary conditions on intermediate quantities in modified dimension-by-dimension methods. In addition, a new simple yet effective set of reconstruction variables is introduced, which could be useful in existing schemes with little modification. The proposed scheme is applied to a suite of stringent and informative benchmark problems to demonstrate its efficacy and utility. A highly parallel multi-GPU implementation using Kokkos and the message-passing interface is also provided.

总结: 
文章提出了太阳色球中太阳耀斑形成的物理机制，分为三个阶段生命周期。第一阶段，在色球底部形成密度波动，随着时间逐渐向上加速，进入过渡区后加速增加，在进入日冕区时减速至零。文章还分析了等离子体密度和速度随时间和空间的变化，以及重力对太阳色球中物质运动的影响。 <div>
The physical mechanism for the creation of solar spicules is proposed with three stages of their life cycle. It is assumed that at stage I the density hump is formed locally in the x-y plane in the lower chromosphere in the presence of temperature gradients of electrons and ions along the z-axis (the vertical direction). In this region, the density structure of quasi-neutral (ni ≃ ne = n) plasma after taking birth is accelerated in the vertical direction owing to the thermal force Fth ∝ ∇n(x, y, t) × (∇Te + ∇Ti). The exact time-dependent analytical solution of two-fluid plasma equations is presented assuming that density is maximum at the center of the density structure and decays away from it gradually. The 2D density structure is created as a step function H(t) in time at the bottom of the chromosphere, and consequently, the vertical plasma velocity turns out to be the ramp function of time R(t) = tH(t), whereas the source term S(x, y, t) for the density follows the delta function δ(t) form. The upward acceleration produced in this density structure is greater than the downward constant solar acceleration −g⊙ in the chromosphere. In the transition region, the temperature gradients are steeper; therefore, the upward acceleration increases in magnitude g⊙ ≪ a and the density hump spends less time there. This is stage II of its life cycle. In stage III, the density structure enters into the corona, where the gradients of temperatures vanish and the structure decelerates to zero velocity under the action of the solar gravitational force.

本研究利用Keck/NIRC2的自适应光学和旋涡日冕仪进行了高对比度成像，首次在近红外观测到了13个距离约为2-3kpc的高质量X射线双星系统。研究发现了多个可能的环绕双星的伴星候选体，包括次恒星体（棕矮星）和恒星体。通过银河系人口模型分析，鉴别了可能是背景/前景星的源并找出了与X射线双星可能有很高概率（≳60%–99%）为引力束缚的伴星。该研究初步建立了未来动力学分析和后续观测的目录。根据初步结果，研究估算了X射线双星的伴星频率和多重性频率分别为≈0.6和1.8 ± 0.9，仅考虑了最有可能与X射线双星束缚的源。此外，研究还扩展了我们对次恒星体和恒星体如何在这些极端系统中形成并存活的理解，为我们理解X射线双星的形成打开了新的窗口。<br /><br />总结: 本研究利用高对比度成像技术在近红外观测了13个高质量X射线双星系统，发现了多个可能的环绕双星的伴星候选体，初步建立了未来研究的目录，并估算了X射线双星的伴星频率和多重性频率。研究还扩展了我们对次恒星体和恒星体在这些系统中形成和存活的理解，为我们理解X射线双星的形成打开了新的窗口。 <div>
Although the study of X-ray binaries has led to major breakthroughs in high-energy astrophysics, their circumbinary environment at scales of ∼100–10,000 au has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we undertake a novel and exploratory study by employing direct and high-contrast imaging techniques on a sample of X-ray binaries, using adaptive optics and the vortex coronagraph on Keck/NIRC2. High-contrast imaging opens up the possibility to search for exoplanets, brown dwarfs, circumbinary companion stars, and protoplanetary disks in these extreme systems. Here we present the first near-infrared high-contrast images of 13 high-mass X-ray binaries located within ∼2–3 kpc. The key results of this campaign involve the discovery of several candidate circumbinary companions ranging from substellar (brown dwarf) to stellar masses. By conducting an analysis based on Galactic population models, we discriminate sources that are likely background/foreground stars and isolate those that have a high probability (≳60%–99%) of being gravitationally bound to the X-ray binary. This paper seeks to establish a preliminary catalog for future analyses of proper motion and subsequent observations. With our preliminary results, we calculate the first estimate of the companion frequency and the multiplicity frequency for X-ray binaries: ≈0.6 and 1.8 ± 0.9, respectively, considering only the sources that are most likely bound to the X-ray binary. In addition to extending our comprehension of how brown dwarfs and stars can form and survive in such extreme systems, our study opens a new window to our understanding of the formation of X-ray binaries.

<div> Jupiter, metal-poor, enrichment, radiative layer, accretion<br />
<br />总结: 木星的形成和结构模型预测了一个贫金属的外层，这与Galileo探测器测得的两到三倍太阳金属丰度不符。同时，Juno的数据表明水和氨的丰度增加。研究者通过探讨木星是否可能存在一个深层辐射层来解决这一矛盾。结果显示，在木星演化过程中的重元素吸积可以导致大气层的富集，这种结构能够在数十亿年内保持稳定。重元素的来源可能是累积的小撞击或一次大的撞击。这个富集的偏好情景需要一个深层辐射区，并且通过与分子扩散类似的效率进行边界的垂直混合。因此，木星的大部分分子外壳可能具有太阳的组成，而其最上层大气富含较重元素，这种富集可能来自固体物体的吸积。这种可能性解决了木星内部模型和大气成分测量之间长期存在的不匹配。此外，研究还调查了富集是否可能是由于稀释核心的侵蚀，结果表明这种可能性极低。这个侵蚀核心的情景与演化计算、深层辐射层和已发表的内部模型不一致。 <div>
Updated formation and structure models of Jupiter predict a metal-poor envelope. This is at odds with the two to three times solar metallicity measured by the Galileo probe. Additionally, Juno data imply that water and ammonia are enriched. Here, we explore whether Jupiter could have a deep radiative layer separating the atmosphere from the deeper interior. The radiative layer could be caused by a hydrogen-transparency window or depletion of alkali metals. We show that heavy-element accretion during Jupiter’s evolution could lead to the desired atmospheric enrichment and that this configuration would be stable over billions of years. The origin of the heavy elements could be cumulative small impacts or one large impact. The preferred scenario requires a deep radiative zone, due to a local reduction of the opacity at ∼2000 K by ∼90%, which is supported by Juno data, and vertical mixing through the boundary with an efficiency similar to that of molecular diffusion (D ≲ 10−2 cm2 s−1). Therefore, most of Jupiter’s molecular envelope could have solar composition while its uppermost atmosphere is enriched with heavier elements. The enrichment likely originates from the accretion of solid objects. This possibility resolves the long-standing mismatch between Jupiter’s interior models and atmospheric composition measurements. Furthermore, our results imply that the measured atmospheric composition of exoplanets does not necessarily reflect their bulk compositions. We also investigate whether the enrichment could be due to the erosion of a dilute core and show that this is highly unlikely. The core-erosion scenario is inconsistent with evolution calculations, the deep radiative layer, and published interior models.

<div> Gaia Data Release 3, red giant stars, chemodynamical properties, Vϕ–[Fe/H] maps, bar-like kinematics<br />Merger-induced Splash, comparison with Auriga simulation, formation of bar, evolution of classical bulge<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用盖亚第三版数据中的红巨星，探讨了银河系在方位速度Vϕ和金属丰度[Fe/H]空间中的化学动力学特性。研究发现了从星系核到外盘的行星Vϕ–[Fe/H]图的一致序列，清晰展现了薄盘/厚盘和Splash的特征。金属丰度较高的恒星显示出类似条状结构的动力学特性，而金属丰度较低的恒星则显示出以色散为主导的动力学特性。在中等金属丰度（−1 < [Fe/H]< − 0.4）范围内可以分为两种类型，一种类似于条状结构，即动力学冷（km s−1）且快速旋转（Vϕ ≳ 100 km s−1），另一种是Splash，动力学热（km s−1）且缓慢旋转（Vϕ ≲ 100 km s−1）。通过与Auriga模拟的比较发现，只有在大约10亿年前发生的最后一次主要合并事件周围诞生的恒星在Vϕ–[Fe/H]空间中展现出类似Splash的特征，这意味着Splash很可能是由合并引起的，主要由受加热的盘星和与最后一次主要合并相关的星爆形成。Splash是由原始盘形成的，其较低的金属丰度限制与厚盘相吻合。条状结构形成于金属丰度> −1 dex的动力学热盘，Splash不参与条状结构的形成和增长。此外，我们通过一系列孤立演化的N体盘模拟验证了经典星系核可以被条状结构旋转并发展出柱状旋转的情况，与金属丰度较低的恒星的观测结果一致。 <br /> <div>
We explore the chemodynamical properties of the Galaxy in the azimuthal velocity Vϕ and metallicity [Fe/H] space using red giant stars from Gaia Data Release 3. The row-normalized Vϕ–[Fe/H] maps form a coherent sequence from the bulge to the outer disk, clearly revealing the thin/thick disk and the Splash. The metal-rich stars display bar-like kinematics, while the metal-poor stars show dispersion-dominated kinematics. The intermediate-metallicity population (−1 < [Fe/H]< − 0.4) can be separated into two populations, one that is bar-like, i.e., dynamically cold ( km s−1) and fast-rotating (Vϕ ≳ 100 km s−1), and the Splash, which is dynamically hot ( km s−1) and slow-rotating (Vϕ ≲ 100 km s−1). We compare the observations in the bulge region with an Auriga simulation where the last major merger event occurred ∼10 Gyr ago: only stars born around the time of the merger reveal a Splash-like feature in the Vϕ–[Fe/H] space, suggesting that the Splash is likely merger-induced, predominantly made up of heated disk stars and the starburst associated with the last major merger. Since the Splash formed from the proto-disk, its lower metallicity limit coincides with that of the thick disk. The bar formed later from the dynamically hot disk with [Fe/H] > − 1 dex, with the Splash not participating in the bar formation and growth. Moreover, with a set of isolated evolving N-body disk simulations, we confirm that a nonrotating classical bulge can be spun up by the bar and develop cylindrical rotation, consistent with the observations for the metal-poor stars.

总结: 这篇文章讨论了吸积流的角动量对其特性的影响，研究发现吸积流的角动量决定了其解的类型，通过数值模拟发现在Kerr黑洞周围，角动量较低的吸积流显示出与高或者非常低角动量吸积流显著不同的性质，而中等范围的角动量吸积流在黑洞附近具有最高的密度、压力和温度，并且具有非对称性质，这对观测Sgr A*超大质量黑洞的复杂特征提供了可能的解释。另外，随着角动量的减小，音速面也会远离最内稳定圆轨道。总结: <br /> <div>
An essential factor for determining the characteristics of an accretion flow is its angular momentum. According to the angular momentum of the flow, semi-analytical analysis suggests various types of accretion solutions. It is critical to test these with numerical simulations, using the most advanced framework available (general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics), to understand how the flow changes with different angular momentum. By changing the initial condition of the accretion torus minimally, we can simulate a steady, low-angular-momentum accretion flow around a Kerr black hole. We focus primarily on the lower limits of angular momentum and find that an accretion flow with an intermediate range of angular momentum differs significantly from high- or very-low-angular-momentum flows. The intermediate-angular-momentum accretion flow has the highest density, pressure, and temperature near the black hole, making it easier to observe. We find that the density and pressure have power-law scalings ρ ∝ rn−3/2 and pg ∝ rn−5/2, which only hold for very-low-angular-momentum cases. With the increase in flow angular momentum, it develops a nonaxisymmetric nature. In this case, simple self-similarity does not hold. We also find that the sonic surface moves away from the innermost stable circular orbit as the angular momentum decreases. Finally, we emphasize that an intermediate-angular-momentum flow could provide a possible solution to explaining the complex observation features of the supermassive black hole Sgr A* at our galactic center.

<div> slim disk, radiative flux, specific energy, black hole, relativistic jets
<br /><br />总结:
研究了从纤细盘中喷射出相对论性喷流的机制。在纤细盘中，辐射压力占主导地位，辐射能量沿垂直方向的压力梯度流动。辐射通量的散度告诉我们，从近赤道平面的底层流向上边界面上方的另一层的辐射能量流被吸收。吸收的能量随着物质向内移动而在上层累积，计算表明，当通过上层的流量相对较低时，上层流的比能量在黑洞附近可以达到∼c2。由于比能量∼c2远远大于引力能量，当几乎所有角动量被移除后，上层的最内部部分的高度可能显着增加。因此，上层的最内部部分在几乎所有角动量被移除后的高度可能远远大于黑洞的大小，并且流动可能会在盘的中央轴周围相互碰撞，从轴向反弹，同时沿着轴向扩展。预计流动沿着中央轴向外流，并由于其横截面的改变而变得超音速，最终产生相对论性喷流。 <div>
A mechanism for the ejection of relativistic jets from slim disks is studied. Since radiation pressure is dominant in the slim disk, radiative energy flows along the pressure gradient in the vertical direction. The divergence of the radiative flux tells us that the flow of radiative energy from a bottom layer near the equatorial plane is absorbed by another layer above the boundary surface. The absorbed energy accumulates in the upper layer as the matter advances inward, and calculations show that the specific energy of the flow in the upper layer can be as large as ∼c2 near the black hole when the accretion rate through the upper layer is relatively low. Since the specific energy ∼c2 is much larger than the gravitational energy, the height of the upper layer could significantly increase then. Hence, the innermost part of the upper layer after almost all the angular momentum has been removed could have a much greater height than the size of the black hole, and the flow could collide with itself around the central axis of the disk, bouncing back from the axis while simultaneously expanding along it. The flow is expected to go outward along the central axis and to become supersonic due to the change in its cross section, finally producing relativistic jets.

本文通过马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛的Metropolis算法对不同类型的振荡暗能量(DE)模型进行了比较研究。文中考察了八种不同的振荡参数化模型，这些模型已经表现出相当的能力来适应整体宇宙观测，包括Ia型超新星Pantheon样本、宇宙学原初黑体辐射的距离先验等。作者使用了Akaike信息准则和偏差信息准则来比较这些模型与观测数据的一致性。结果表明，这些模型能够解决宇宙巧合问题并缓解哈勃张力。此外，文中还讨论了根据SHoES的测量结果对模型进行修正得到的Hubble常数值的变化。  <div>
In this paper, we have performed a comparative study of different types of oscillating dark energy (DE) models using the Metropolis algorithm of Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Eight different oscillating parameterizations are examined herein that have demonstrated considerable ability to fit the overall cosmological observations, including the Pantheon sample of Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, cosmic chronometer Hubble data, and distance priors of the Planck cosmic microwave background. In order to compare the consistency of these models with observations, we have used both the Akaike and deviance information criteria. Although the values of the Akaike information criterion for different models indicate that there is no support for oscillating DE models, the deviance information criterion showed that there is significant support for some of these models. Our results showed that these models are capable of solving the cosmic coincidence problem and alleviating the Hubble tension. Comparing the H0 values obtained for different oscillating scenarios with that of ΛCDM, we observed that our oscillating models led to , which is 0.29 greater than H0,Λ and thus reduces the Hubble tension. Among all of the models, model 1, with H0 = 70.00 ± 0.71, is the most capable of alleviating the H0 tension. Furthermore, we examined our models assuming H0 = 73.0 ± 1.4 from SHoES measurements. We find that adding this data point to our data combination led to a increase in the H0 value for different models.

总结：<br /><br /> 近期研究发现在水星轨道附近添加额外的胚胎可以更成功地形成类似水星的天体。研究目的是通过模拟太阳系的形成过程，并考虑巨大行星木星和土星的存在来形成水星。研究发现，在模拟过程中，具有核质量分数（CMFs）大于0.4的水星类似物在约10％的模拟中形成，两倍于此数目的水星类似物在形成过程中不稳定并未持续到模拟结束。大部分水星类似物的CMFs低于水星的0.7，这是由于显著的碎片物质吸积所致。研究建议需要更深入地了解碎片物质在碰撞磨粒过程中的流失比例，以便更好地理解水星的形成过程，或者需要其他机制来阻止这些碎片物质的吸积。 <div>
Mercury is notoriously difficult to form in Solar System simulations, due to its small mass and iron-rich composition. Smooth particle hydrodynamics simulations of collisions have found that a Mercury-like body could be formed by one or multiple giant impacts, but due to the chaotic nature of collisions, it is difficult to create a scenario where such impacts will take place. Recent work has found more success forming Mercury analogues by adding additional embryos near Mercury’s orbit. In this work, we aim to form Mercury by simulating the formation of the Solar System in the presence of the giant planets Jupiter and Saturn. We test out the effect of an inner disk of embryos added on to the commonly used narrow annulus of initial material. We form Mercury analogues with core-mass fractions (CMFs) > 0.4 in ∼10% of our simulations, and twice that number of Mercury analogues form during the formation process but are unstable and do not last to the end of the simulations. Mercury analogues form at similar rates for both disks with and without an inner component, and most of our Mercury analogues have lower CMFs than that of Mercury, ∼0.7, due to significant accretion of debris material. We suggest that a more in-depth understanding of the fraction of debris mass that is lost to collisional grinding is necessary to understand Mercury’s formation, or some additional mechanism is required to stop this debris from accreting.

<div> 关键词: H-poor Type I超明亮超新星, W形O ii线, 合成光谱, 温度, 非热电离率<br />
<br />总结:
本研究通过系统计算合成光谱，重现了八颗H-poor Type I超明亮超新星的观测光谱。研究发现，W形O ii线的形成对温度敏感，需要在T ∼ 14,000–16,000 K的范围内才能产生而不需要大的偏离。而W形O ii线的出现对于非热电离率也有约束作用，可以为SLSNe I的能量来源提供独立的约束。因此，SLSNe I的光谱特征可以通过非热电离率对能量来源进行独立约束。 <div>
H-poor Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe I) are characterized by O ii lines around 4000–4500 Å in pre-/near-maximum spectra, the so-called W-shaped O ii lines. As these lines are from relatively high excitation levels, they have been considered a sign of nonthermal processes, which may provide a hint of the power sources of SLSNe I. However, the conditions for these lines to appear have not been well understood. In this work, we systematically calculate synthetic spectra to reproduce the observed spectra of eight SLSNe I, parameterizing departure coefficients from the nebular approximation in the supernova ejecta (expressed as bneb). We find that most of the observed spectra can be well reproduced with bneb ≲ 10, which means that no strong departure is necessary for the formation of the W-shaped O ii lines. We also show that the appearance of the W-shaped O ii lines is sensitive to temperature; only spectra with temperatures in the range of T ∼ 14,000–16,000 K can produce the W-shaped O ii lines without large departures. Based on this, we constrain the nonthermal ionization rate near the photosphere. Our results suggest that spectral features of SLSNe I can give independent constraints on the power source through the nonthermal ionization rates.

We report high angular resolution observations, made with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array in band 6, of high excitation molecular lines of and SO2 and of the H29α radio recombination line toward the G345.0061+01.794 B HC H ii region in order to investigate the physical and kinematical characteristics of its surroundings. Emission was detected in all observed components of the J = 14 →13 rotational ladder of and in the 304,26–303,27, and 324,28–323,29 lines of SO2. The peak of the velocity-integrated molecular emission is located ∼0.″4 northwest of the peak of the continuum emission. The first-order moment images and channel maps show a velocity gradient of 1.1 km s−1 arcsec−1 across the source and a distinctive spot of blueshifted emission toward the peak of the zero-order moment. The rotational temperature is found to decrease from 252±24 K at the peak position to 166±16 K at its edge, indicating that our molecular observations are probing a hot molecular core that is internally excited. The emission in the H29α line arises from a region of 0.″65 in size, where its peak coincides with that of the dust continuum. We model the kinematical characteristics of the “central blue spot” feature as due to infalling motions, suggesting a central mass of 172.8±8.8 M⊙. Our observations indicate that this HC H ii region is surrounded by a compact structure of hot molecular gas, which is rotating and infalling toward a central mass, that is most likely confining the ionized region. The observed scenario is reminiscent of a “butterfly pattern” with an approximately edge-on torus and ionized gas roughly parallel to its rotation axis.

<title>Optical Photometric Indicators of Galaxy Cluster Relaxation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The most dynamically relaxed clusters of galaxies play a special role in cosmological studies as well as astrophysical studies of the intracluster medium (ICM) and active galactic nucleus feedback. While high-spatial-resolution imaging of the morphology of the ICM has long been the gold standard for establishing a cluster’s dynamical state, such data are not available from current or planned surveys, and thus require separate, pointed follow-up observations. With optical and/or near-IR photometric imaging, and red-sequence cluster finding results from those data, expected to be ubiquitously available for clusters discovered in upcoming optical and millimeter-wavelength surveys, it is worth asking how effectively photometric data alone can identify relaxed cluster candidates, before investing in, e.g., high-resolution X-ray observations. Here we assess the ability of several simple photometric measurements, based on the redMaPPer cluster finder run on Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, to reproduce X-ray classifications of dynamical state for an X-ray selected sample of massive clusters. We find that two simple metrics contrasting the bright central galaxy (BCG) to other cluster members can identify a complete sample of relaxed clusters with a purity of ∼40% in our data set. Including minimal ICM information in the form of a center position increases the purity to ∼60%. However, all three metrics depend critically on correctly identifying the BCG, which is presently a challenge for optical red-sequence cluster finders.

The blue supergiant (BSG) problem, namely, the overabundance of BSGs inconsistent with classical stellar evolution theory, remains an open question in stellar astrophysics. Several theoretical explanations have been proposed, which may be tested by their predictions for the characteristic time variability. In this work, we analyze the light curves of a sample of 20 BSGs obtained from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission. We report a characteristic signal in the low-frequency (f ≲ 2 day−1) range for all our targets. The amplitude spectrum has a peak frequency of ∼0.2 day−1, and we are able to fit it by a modified Lorentzian profile. The signal itself shows strong stochasticity across different TESS sectors, suggesting its driving mechanism happens on short (≲months) timescales. Our signals resemble those obtained for a limited sample of hotter OB stars and yellow supergiants, suggesting their possible common origins. We discuss three possible physical explanations: stellar winds launched by rotation, convection motions that reach the stellar surface, and waves from the deep stellar interior. The peak frequency of the signal favors processes related to the convective zone caused by the iron opacity peak, and the shape of the spectra might be explained by the propagation of high-order, damped gravity waves excited from that zone. We discuss the uncertainties and limitations of all these scenarios.

<div> Submillimeter Array, 230 GHz, giant molecular cloud, Andromeda galaxy, M31
<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用Submillimeter Array在230 GHz处对仙女座星系(M31)中的巨型分子云(GMC)进行了深入的干涉观测，以研究其物理特性。作者利用12CO和13CO的发射来推导162个空间分辨的GMC的质量、大小和速度离散度，并对其中的117个具有单分量线型的GMC进行了详细研究。在对这些GMC的Larson关系进行检验后，得出以下结论：一是在12CO和13CO发射中都存在高度相关的质量-大小关系；二是12CO线宽-大小（LWS）关系较弱，而13CO LWS关系几乎不存在，这表明LWS关系可能与空间尺度有关；三是只有43%的GMCs是由引力约束的。研究者根据13CO发射的强度和范围将GMCs分为了两类，发现强13CO发射的GMC中大部分（73%）都是由引力约束的，而弱13CO发射的GMC中只有25%是由引力约束的。最后，研究发现M31的GMC的物理特性在许多方面与本地系的银河云非常相似。 <div>
Deep interferometric observations of CO and dust continuum emission are obtained with the Submillimeter Array at 230 GHz to investigate the physical nature of the giant molecular cloud (GMC) population in the Andromeda galaxy (M31). We use J = 2 − 1 12CO and 13CO emission to derive the masses, sizes, and velocity dispersions of 162 spatially resolved GMCs. We perform a detailed study of a subset of 117 GMCs that exhibit simple, single-component line profile shapes. Examining the Larson scaling relations for these GMCs, we find (1) a highly correlated mass–size relation in both 12CO and 13CO emission; (2) a weakly correlated 12CO line width–size (LWS) relation along with a weaker, almost nonexistent, 13CO LWS relation, suggesting a possible dependence of the LWS relation on spatial scale; and (3) that only 43% of these GMCs are gravitationally bound. We identify two classes of GMCs based on the strength and extent of their 13CO emission. Examination of the Larson relations finds that both classes are individually characterized by strong 12CO mass–size relations and much weaker 12CO and 13CO LWS relations. The majority (73%) of strong 13CO-emitting GMCs are found to be gravitationally bound. However, only 25% of the weak 13CO-emitting GMCs are bound. The resulting breakdown in the Larson relations in the weak 13CO-emitting population decouples the mass–size and LWS relations, demonstrating that independent physical causes are required to understand the origin of each. Finally, in nearly every aspect, the physical properties of the M31 GMCs are found to be very similar to those of local Milky Way clouds.

总结:
本文报告了对1A 1744−361的高强度突发进行了为期三个月的监测。文章利用X射线和射电数据对其进行了时序和光谱分析。X射线硬度-强度和色度图表明1A 1744−361在大部分突发期间处于环礁态，但在突发高峰时表现出类似Z态的特性。在NICER数据的时序分析中发现了约8赫兹的准周期振荡，并将其与Z态中的正常支QPOs联系起来。MeerKAT的射电监测数据显示，源在突发高峰期间射电最亮，并在突发发生约3天后从“岛屿”谱态过渡到“香蕉”谱态，同时产生了瞬发射流物质。文章还报道了源的X射线吸收线特征，可能来自吸积盘大气层。这些观测结果提供了关于低质量吸积率（环礁态）时源发生射电耀斑和射流物质的强有力证据。 <div>
We report on X-ray (NICER/NuSTAR/MAXI/Swift) and radio (MeerKAT) timing and spectroscopic analysis from a 3 month monitoring campaign in 2022 of a high-intensity outburst of the dipping neutron star low-mass X-ray binary 1A 1744−361. The 0.5–6.8 keV NICER X-ray hardness–intensity and color–color diagrams of the observations throughout the outburst suggest that 1A 1744−361 spent most of its outburst in an atoll-state, but we show that the source exhibited Z-state-like properties at the peak of the outburst, similar to a small sample of other atoll-state sources. A timing analysis with NICER data revealed several instances of an ≈8 Hz quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO; fractional rms amplitudes of ∼5%) around the peak of the outburst, the first from this source, which we connect to the normal branch QPOs seen in the Z-state. Our observations of 1A 1744−361 are fully consistent with the idea of the mass accretion rate being the main distinguishing parameter between atoll- and Z-states. Radio monitoring data by MeerKAT suggests that the source was at its radio-brightest during the outburst peak, and that the source transitioned from the “island” spectral state to the “banana” state within ∼3 days of the outburst onset, launching transient jet ejecta. The observations present the strongest evidence for radio flaring, including jet ejecta, during the island-to-banana spectral state transition at low accretion rates (atoll-state). The source also exhibited Fe xxv, Fe xxvi Kα, and Kβ X-ray absorption lines, whose origins likely lie in an accretion disk atmosphere.

<br />总结:
这篇文章介绍了一项针对澳大利亚深空能源调查中的活跃星系核/类星体光谱的全南天天空的Mg iiλλ2796，2803双线吸收体的调查。调查覆盖了红移为0.33≤z≤2.19范围内656个Mg ii吸收系统，其当量宽度为0.3≤Wr(2796)≤ 3.45 Å。通过Monte Carlo模型计算得出Mg ii质量密度ΩMg II ∼ 5 × 10−7，且在跨越约7亿年的时间跨度后没有证据表明其演变。这个模型还可以利用大型低分辨率调查的效率，仅需要来自昂贵高分辨率调查的少量样本。 <div>
We present an all-southern sky survey for Mg iiλλ2796, 2803 doublet absorbers in 951 z < 4 active galactic nucleus/quasar spectra from the Australian Dark Energy Survey. The spectral resolution ranges from R = 1400 to 1700 over the wavelengths 3700–8800 Å. The survey has a 5σ detection completeness of 50% and above for rest-frame equivalent widths Wr(2796) ≥ 0.3 Å. We studied 656 Mg ii absorption systems over the redshift range 0.33 ≤ z ≤ 2.19 with equivalent widths 0.3 ≤ Wr(2796) ≤ 3.45 Å. The equivalent width distribution is well fit by an exponential function with W* = 0.76 ± 0.04 Å, and the redshift path density exhibits very little evolution. Overall, our findings are consistent with the large, predominantly northern sky, surveys of Mg ii absorbers. We developed and implemented a Monte Carlo model informed by a high-resolution Mg ii survey for determining the Mg ii mass density, ΩMg II. We found ΩMg II ∼ 5 × 10−7 with no evidence of evolution over a ∼7 Gyr time span following Cosmic Noon. Incorporating measurements covering 2.0 ≤ z ≤ 6.4 from the literature, we extended our insights into Mg ii mass density evolution from the end of reionization well past the Cosmic Noon epoch. The presented Monte Carlo model has potential for advancing our knowledge of the evolution of mass densities of metal ions common to quasar absorption line studies, as it exploits the efficiency of large low-resolution surveys while requiring only small samples from expensive high-resolution surveys.

Fully convective M dwarfs typically remain rapidly rotating and magnetically active for billions of years, followed by an abrupt and mass-dependent transition to slow rotation and quiescence. A robust understanding of this process is complicated by difficulties in estimating M dwarf ages and potential dependencies on other variables such as birth environment or metallicity. To isolate the effect of mass, we consider M dwarfs in wide binaries. We identify 67 widely separated, fully convective (0.08–0.35 M⊙) M dwarf binary systems using Gaia and measure the Hα feature for each component. We classify the pairs into three categories: systems where both components are active, systems where both are inactive, and candidate transition systems, where one component is active and the other inactive. We gather higher-resolution spectra of the candidate transition systems to verify that their behavior does not result from an unresolved third component, yielding one new triple with surprising activity levels. Neglecting this triple, we find 22 active, 36 inactive, and eight transition pairs. Our results are consistent with the epoch of spindown for these binaries being primarily determined by mass, with mild second-order effects; we place a 1σ upper limit of 0.5 Gyr or 25% on the dispersion in the mass-dependent spindown relation. Our findings suggest that the large dispersion in the spindown epoch previously observed for field stars of a given mass may stem from differences in birth environment, in addition to modest intrinsic stochasticity. We also see evidence that the wide binary population is dispersed over time due to dynamical processing.

<div> 磁场，气体动力学，银河系，辐射冷却，热平衡
<br /><br />总结:
通过三维模拟和辐射冷却和加热的研究，我们发现在银河系的球状星系核区域，磁场对气体动力学起着重要作用。当太阳系核区域附近的温度遵循辐射冷却和加热的热平衡曲线时，形成了高温的等离子气体，并在中平面附近形成低温气体。尽管星际气体的热能通过辐射冷却减少，但磁场强度的饱和水平并不明显受到辐射冷却和加热的影响。平均磁场强度增至10μG，并在局部达到数百微高斯。我们发现在具有辐射冷却和加热的情况下，在中纬度形成了磁场主导的区域，而在没有辐射效应的情况下则没有。这些中纬度区域的垂直厚度为50-150pc，径向位置在0.4-0.8kpc，与中性原子气体的观测垂直分布相当。当对银河系球状星系核区域不同能量密度组分进行平均时，磁能与热能相当。因此，我们得出结论，磁场在控制银河系球状星系核区域的动力和热特性方面发挥了重要作用。 <div>
We investigate the role of magnetic field on the gas dynamics in a galactic bulge region by three-dimensional simulations with radiative cooling and heating. While a high-temperature corona with T > 106 K is formed in the halo regions, the temperature near the midplane is ≲104 K following the thermal equilibrium curve determined by the radiative cooling and heating. Although the thermal energy of the interstellar gas is lost by radiative cooling, the saturation level of the magnetic field strength does not significantly depend on the radiative cooling and heating. The magnetic field strength is amplified to 10 μG on average and reaches several hundred microgauss locally. We find the formation of magnetically dominated regions at midlatitudes in the case with the radiative cooling and heating, which is not seen in the case without radiative effect. The vertical thickness of the midlatitude regions is 50–150 pc at the radial location of 0.4–0.8 kpc from the Galactic center, which is comparable to the observed vertical distribution of neutral atomic gas. When we take the average of different components of energy density integrated over the galactic bulge region, the magnetic energy is comparable to the thermal energy. We conclude that the magnetic field plays a substantial role in controlling the dynamical and thermal properties of the galactic bulge region.

总结:
JWST和SMILES项目取得了重要进展，通过MIRI检测到的3273个源的光谱能量分布（SED）分析，发现了217个AGN候选体，其中包括主要样本111个普通大质量星系中的AGN，86个低质量星系中的AGN候选体，以及20个高红移的AGN候选体。80%的MIRI选定的AGN候选体是新的发现，尤其是在质量较大的星系中，34%的MIRI AGN鉴定是新的，突显了遮挡对先前选择的影响。另外，对不同波长的观测结果进行汇总后，构建了迄今最完整的AGN样本，并研究了不同选择技术的相对表现。AGN遮挡比例从LAGN,bol ∼ 1010L⊙增加到1011L⊙，然后随着较高的亮度而下降。此外，受遮挡的AGN比例从z ∼ 0逐渐增加到z ∼ 4，大多数高红移的AGN受到遮挡。我们讨论了AGN的遮挡、固有SED变化、星系污染、调查深度和选择技术如何复杂化了完整的AGN样本的构建。 <div>
Understanding the coevolution of supermassive black holes and their host systems requires a comprehensive census of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) behavior across a wide range of redshift, luminosity, obscuration level, and galaxy properties. We report significant progress with JWST toward this goal from the Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES). Based on comprehensive spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis of 3273 MIRI-detected sources, we identify 217 AGN candidates over a survey area of ∼34 arcmin2, including a primary sample of 111 AGNs in normal massive galaxies (M* > 109.5M☉) at z ∼ 0–4, an extended sample of 86 AGN candidates in low-mass galaxies (M* < 109.5M☉), and a high-z sample of 20 AGN candidates at z ∼ 4–8.4. Notably, about 80% of our MIRI-selected AGN candidates are new discoveries despite the extensive pre-JWST AGN searches. Even among the massive galaxies where the previous AGN search is believed to be thorough, 34% of the MIRI AGN identifications are new, highlighting the impact of obscuration on previous selections. By combining our results with the efforts at other wavelengths, we build the most complete AGN sample to date and examine the relative performance of different selection techniques. We find the obscured AGN fraction increases from LAGN,bol ∼ 1010L⊙ to 1011L⊙ and then drops toward higher luminosity. Additionally, the obscured AGN fraction gradually increases from z ∼ 0 to z ∼ 4 with most high-z AGNs obscured. We discuss how AGN obscuration, intrinsic SED variations, galaxy contamination, survey depth, and selection techniques complicate the construction of a complete AGN sample.

研究发现星际湍流速度与局部星形成率表面密度之间存在相关性。分子气体的局部速度离散度随着星形成率表面密度的增加而增加，但维里参数大致保持不变，表明分子气体仍然是自引力的。这种相关性是由于速度离散度取决于分子表面密度和物体云的质量，而星形成率表面密度随着这些量的增加而增加。此外，压力波动也受到了研究。分子的压力的方位变化与星际湍流率的关联比预期的要弱一些，这表明螺旋臂中分子的星形成效率有轻微提高。总体而言，动态平衡压力和星形成率有很好的相关性，提示这种相关性可能是星形成的前兆，而不是一种反应。最后，研究结果表明，反馈和银河动力学过程都扮演着重要的角色。 <br /><br />总结: 研究发现星际湍流速度与局部星形成率表面密度存在相关性；分子气体的局部速度离散度随着星形成率表面密度的增加而增加，但维里参数保持不变；压力波动也受到了研究，表明螺旋臂中分子的星形成效率有所提高；动态平衡压力和星形成率有很好的相关性；最后，研究结果表明，反馈和银河动力学过程都扮演着重要的角色。 <div>
The correlation between interstellar turbulent speed and local star formation rate surface density, ΣSFR, is studied using CO observations in the PHANGS survey. The local velocity dispersion of molecular gas, σ, increases with ΣSFR, but the virial parameter, αvir, is about constant, suggesting the molecular gas remains self-gravitating. The correlation arises because σ depends on the molecular surface density, Σmol, and object cloud mass, Mmol, with the usual molecular cloud correlations, while ΣSFR increases with both of these quantities because of a nearly constant star formation efficiency for CO. Pressure fluctuations with ΔΣSFR are also examined. Azimuthal variations of molecular pressure, ΔPmol, have a weaker correlation with ΔΣSFR than expected from the power-law correlation between the total quantities, suggesting slightly enhanced star formation rate (SFR) efficiency per molecule in spiral arms. Dynamical equilibrium pressure and SFR correlate well for the whole sample, as , which is steeper than in other studies. The azimuthal fluctuations, ΔPDE(ΔΣSFR), follow the total correlation PDE(ΣSFR) closely, hinting that some of this correlation may be a precursor to star formation, rather than a reaction. Galactic dynamical processes correlate linearly such that for total gas surface density Σgas and galactic dynamical rates, R, equal to κ, A, or Ω, representing epicyclic frequency, shear rate A, and orbit rate Ω. These results suggest important roles for both feedback and galactic dynamics.

Supernova (SN) 1987A offers a unique opportunity to study how a spatially resolved SN evolves into a young SN remnant. We present and analyze Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging observations of SN 1987A obtained in 2022 and compare them with HST observations from 2009 to 2021. These observations allow us to follow the evolution of the equatorial ring (ER), the rapidly expanding ejecta, and emission from the center over a wide range in wavelength from 2000 to 11,000 Å. The ER has continued to fade since it reached its maximum ∼8200 days after the explosion. In contrast, the ejecta brightened until day ∼11,000 before their emission levelled off; the west side brightened more than the east side, which we attribute to the stronger X-ray emission by the ER on that side. The asymmetric ejecta expand homologously in all filters, which are dominated by various emission lines from hydrogen, calcium, and iron. From this overall similarity, we infer the ejecta are chemically well mixed on large scales. The exception is the diffuse morphology observed in the UV filters dominated by emission from the Mg ii resonance lines that get scattered before escaping. The 2022 observations do not show any sign of the compact object that was inferred from highly ionized emission near the remnant’s center observed with JWST. We determine an upper limit on the flux from a compact central source in the [O iii] HST image. The nondetection of this line indicates that the S and Ar lines observed with JWST originate from the O free inner Si–S–Ar-rich zone and/or that the observed [O iii] flux is strongly affected by dust scattering.

<div> 关键词: 星系, 化学丰度, 形成红移, 恒星形成, 天体合并
总结: 
本研究使用Keck Heavy Metal Survey的数据，对19个大质量恒定星系进行了研究。研究发现这些星系的铁丰度在z∼1.4和z∼2.1时期分别为[Fe/H] = −0.5至−0.1 dex和−0.2 [−0.3] dex，镁铁比值分别为[Mg/Fe] = 0.1–0.6 dex和0.3 [0.5] dex。星系的形成红移为zform = 2–8，并且化学丰度随着时间推移而下降，表明它们在更早的时期形成并且星体形成时间较短。天体合并和中心星体形成可能是形成这些星系的机制。 这些发现对我们理解宇宙中恒定星系的演化提供了重要线索。 <br /><br /> <div>
We present the elemental abundances and ages of 19 massive quiescent galaxies at z ∼ 1.4 and z ∼ 2.1 from the Keck Heavy Metal Survey. The ultradeep LRIS and MOSFIRE spectra were modeled using a full-spectrum stellar population fitting code with variable abundance patterns. The galaxies have iron abundances between [Fe/H] = −0.5 and −0.1 dex, with typical values of −0.2 [−0.3] at z ∼ 1.4 [z ∼ 2.1]. We also find a tentative –[Fe/H] relation at z ∼ 1.4. The magnesium-to-iron ratios span [Mg/Fe] = 0.1–0.6 dex, with typical values of 0.3 [0.5] dex at z ∼ 1.4 [z ∼ 2.1]. The ages imply formation redshifts of zform = 2–8. Compared to quiescent galaxies at lower redshifts, we find that [Fe/H] was ∼0.2 dex lower at z = 1.4–2.1. We find no evolution in [Mg/Fe] out to z ∼ 1.4, though the z ∼ 2.1 galaxies are 0.2 dex enhanced compared to z = 0–0.7. A comparison of these results to a chemical evolution model indicates that galaxies at higher redshift form at progressively earlier epochs and over shorter star formation timescales, with the z ∼ 2.1 galaxies forming the bulk of their stars over 150 Myr at zform ∼ 4. This evolution cannot be solely attributed to an increased number of quiescent galaxies at later times; several Heavy Metal galaxies have extreme chemical properties not found in massive galaxies at z ∼ 0.0–0.7. Thus, the chemical properties of individual galaxies must evolve over time. Minor mergers also cannot fully account for this evolution as they cannot increase [Fe/H], particularly in galaxy centers. Consequently, the buildup of massive quiescent galaxies since z ∼ 2.1 may require further mechanisms, such as major mergers and/or central star formation.

总结: 
在研究中，科学家探讨了原恒星盘的形成过程中磁场和盘旋转之间的对齐关系。他们提出了一种可能的观测方法，即利用“极化孔”来探测磁场和盘旋转之间的对齐情况。通过进行理想磁流体力学模拟，他们发现不同初始磁场和角动量之间的对齐方式会产生不同的磁场结构，从而产生可区分的极化孔。因此，极化孔可能成为磁场和盘旋转对齐关系的探测器，为解决原恒星盘形成过程中的磁场对齐问题提供了新的研究思路。 <div>
The formation of protostellar disks is still a mystery, largely due to the difficulties in observations that can constrain theories. For example, the 3D alignment between the rotation of the disk and the magnetic fields (B-fields) in the formation environment is critical in some models, but so far it is impossible to observe. Here we study the possibility of probing the alignment between B-field and disk rotation using “polarization holes” (PHs). PHs are widely observed and are caused by unresolved B-field structures. With ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate that different initial alignments between B-field and angular momentum (AM) can result in B-field structures that are distinct enough to produce distinguishable PHs. Thus, PHs can potentially serve as probes for alignments between B-field and AM in disk formation.

<title>The MUSE Ultra Deep Field (MUDF). V. Characterizing the Mass–Metallicity Relation for Low-mass Galaxies at z ∼ 1–2</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using more than 100 galaxies in the MUSE Ultra Deep Field with spectroscopy from the Hubble Space Telescope’s (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 and the Very Large Telescope’s Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer, we extend the gas-phase mass–metallicity relation (MZR) at z ≈ 1–2 down to stellar masses of M⋆ ≈ 107.5M⊙. The sample reaches 6 times lower in stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) than previous HST studies at these redshifts, and we find that galaxy metallicities decrease to log(O/H) + 12 ≈ 7.8 ± 0.1 (15% solar) at log(M⋆/M⊙) ≈ 7.5, without evidence of a turnover in the shape of the MZR at low masses. We validate our strong-line metallicities using the direct method for sources with [O iii] λ4363 and [O iii] λ1666 detections, and find excellent agreement between the techniques. The [O iii] λ1666-based metallicities double existing measurements with a signal-to-noise ratio ≥ 5 for unlensed sources at z > 1, validating the strong-line calibrations up to z ∼ 2.5. We confirm that the MZR resides ∼0.3 dex lower in metallicity than local galaxies and is consistent with the fundamental metallicity relation if the low-mass slope varies with SFR. At lower redshifts (z ∼ 0.5) our sample reaches ∼0.5 dex lower in SFR than current calibrations and we find enhanced metallicities that are consistent with extrapolating the MZR to lower SFRs. Finally, we detect only an ∼0.1 dex difference in the metallicities of galaxies in groups versus isolated environments. These results are based on robust calibrations and reach the lowest masses and SFRs that are accessible with HST, providing a critical foundation for studies with the Webb and Roman Space Telescopes.

<title>Runaway OB Stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud. III. Updated Kinematics and Insights into Dynamical versus Supernova Ejections</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We use the kinematics of field OB stars to estimate the frequencies of runaway stars generated by the dynamical ejection scenario (DES), the binary supernova scenario (BSS), and the combined two-step mechanism. We update the proper motions for field OB and OBe stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using Gaia DR3. Our sample now contains 336 stars from the Runaways and Isolated O-Type Star Spectroscopic Survey of the SMC, and we update our algorithm to calculate more accurate velocities compared to those obtained previously from DR2. We find a decrease in median velocity from 39 to 29 km s−1, implying that the proper motions from our previous work were systematically overestimated. We present the velocity distribution for OBe stars and quantitatively compare it to those of noncompact binaries and high-mass X-ray binaries. We confirm that OBe stars appear to be dominated by the BSS and are likely post-SN binary systems, further supporting the mass-transfer model to explain the origin of their emission-line disks. In contrast, normal OB stars may show a bimodal velocity distribution, which may be expected from different processes that occur with dynamical ejections. The kinematics of fast-rotating OB stars are similar to those of normal OB stars rather than OBe stars, suggesting that the origin of their high is different from that of OBe stars. We update our model parameters describing the kinematic origins of the SMC field population, still confirming that for runaway stars, the DES mechanism dominates, and two-step ejections seem comparable in frequency to pure BSS ejections.

<title>ELUCID. VIII. Simulating the Coma Galaxy Cluster to Calibrate Model and Understand Feedback</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We conducted an investigation of the Coma cluster of galaxies by running a series of constrained hydrodynamic simulations with GIZMO-SIMBA and GADGET-3 based on initial conditions reconstructed from the SDSS survey volume in the ELUCID project. We compared simulation predictions and observations for galaxies, intracluster medium (ICM) and intergalactic medium (IGM) in and around the Coma cluster to constrain galaxy formation physics. Our results demonstrate that this type of constrained investigation allows us to probe in more detail the implemented physical processes, because the comparison between simulations and observations is free of cosmic variance and hence can be conducted in a “one-to-one” manner. We found that an increase in the earlier star formation rate and the supernova feedback of the original GIZMO-SIMBA model is needed to match observational data on stellar, interstellar medium, and ICM metallicity. The simulations without active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback can well reproduce the observational ICM electron density, temperature, and entropy profiles, ICM substructures, and the IGM temperature–density relation, while the ones with AGN feedback usually fail. However, one requires something like AGN feedback to reproduce a sufficiently large population of quiescent galaxies, particularly in low-density regions. The constrained simulations of the Coma cluster thus provide a test bed to understand processes that drive galaxy formation and evolution.

<title>Intrinsic Mass–Richness Relation of Clusters from THE THREE HUNDRED Hydrodynamic Simulations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The main systematics in cluster cosmology is the uncertainty in the mass–observable relation. In this paper, we focus on the most direct cluster observable in optical surveys, i.e., richness, and constrain the intrinsic mass–richness (MR) relation of clusters in THE THREE HUNDRED hydrodynamic simulations with two runs: GIZMO-SIMBA and GADGET-X. We find that modeling the richness at a fixed halo mass with a skewed Gaussian distribution yields a simpler and smaller scatter compared to the commonly used lognormal distribution. Additionally, we observe that baryon models have a significant impact on the scatter while exhibiting no influence on the mass dependence and a slight effect on the amplitude in the MR relation. We select member galaxies based on both stellar mass M⋆ and absolute magnitude . We demonstrate that the MR relations obtained from these two selections can be converted to each other by using the relation. Finally, we provide a seven-parameter fitting result comprehensively capturing the dependence of the MR relation on both stellar mass cutoff and redshift.

<title>On Innermost Stable Spherical Orbits near a Rotating Black Hole: A Numerical Study of the Particle Motion near the Plunging Region</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
According to general relativity, astrophysical black holes are described by a small number of parameters. Apart from the mass of the black hole (M), among the most interesting characteristics is the spin (a), which determines the degree of rotation, i.e., the angular momentum of the black hole. The latter is observationally constrained by the spectral and timing properties of the radiation signal emerging from an accretion disk of matter orbiting near the event horizon. In the case of the planar (standard, equatorial) accretion disk, this is the location of the innermost stable circular orbit that determines the observable radiation characteristics and allows us to measure the spin. In this paper, we discuss a more general case of the innermost stable spherical orbits (ISSOs) extending above and below the equatorial plane. To this end, we study the nonequatorial geodesic motion of particles following inclined, spherical, relativistically precessing trajectories with the aim of exploring the boundary between the regions of stable (energetically bound) and escaping (energetically unbound) motion. The concept of the radius of the ISSO should play a role in determining the inner rim of a tilted or geometrically thick accretion flow. We demonstrate that the region of inclined bound orbits has a complicated structure due to enhanced precession near the inner rim. We also explore the fate of particles launched below the radius of the marginally bound spherical orbit: these may either plunge into the event horizon or escape to radial infinity.

Upcoming new coronographs with deeper contrast limits, together with planned and current high-contrast imaging campaigns, will push the detectability limit of protoplanets. These planet-hunting campaigns present a new opportunity to characterize protoplanets and their surrounding environments. However, there are clear uncertainties as to what the extinction levels are at different regions of protoplanetary disks, which will impede our ability to characterize young planets. A correct understanding of the expected extinction, together with multiple photometric observations, will lead to constraints on the extinction levels, dust growth, disk evolution, and protoplanetary accretion rates. In this work, we used hydrodynamic simulations and protoplanetary disk observational constraints obtained from both dust and gas emission to explore the expected extinction maps for continuum filters associated with strong hydrogen lines as tracers of accretion and key broadband photometric filters. We provide a scaling relationship for the extinction as a function of planetary separation and disk mass for three different gas giant masses. We also report values for a subset of disks of interest targeted by multiple imaging campaigns. The described values will be useful for the optimal design of future planet-hunting surveys and for giving context to nondetections in protoplanetary disks and the observed fluxes of point sources along with the birth conditions of protoplanets.

<title>Regions of Suppressed Diffusion around Supernova Remnants?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The recent discovery of the so-called TeV halos has attracted much attention. The morphology of the emission requires that the region is characterized by severe suppression of the diffusion coefficient. This finding raises many questions as to its origin: (1) is the suppressed diffusion to be attributed to instabilities induced by the same radiating particles? (2) or does it actually show that the diffusion coefficient is small throughout the disk of the Galaxy? In both cases, one would expect that the surroundings of supernova remnants (SNRs) should also show evidence of a reduced diffusion coefficient since most remnants are located in the disk and are expected to be sites of effective particle acceleration. Should we expect the existence of regions of extended γ-ray emission from these regions as well? Here, we investigate the transport of cosmic rays (CRs) that have escaped from SNRs in order to assess the viability of the idea of having a cocoon of suppressed diffusion around them. A comparison of our results with the γ-ray emission from the regions around HB9 and W28 does not provide solid evidence of reduced diffusivity. However, if indeed the phenomenon of reduced diffusivity occurs around SNRs surrounded by molecular clouds, our calculations show that the effects on the grammage of Galactic CRs can be significant.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Rapidly rotating neutron stars are similar to highly flattened ellipsoids. Observed spectra of flattened stars must exhibit effects of nonspherical shape and gravitational darkening. We examined in detail the influence of both effects on the observed central energies and profiles of lines of highly ionized iron, Fe xxv and Fe xxvi. We note that the gravitational darkening effect does not change the central energy of lines. Most importantly, spectra of neutron stars that rotate with different frequencies and are seen at various inclination angles differ significantly. The appearance and the depth of lines strongly depend on the parameters, like the inclination angle of the star or the frequency of the star rotation. In this paper we clearly show that the gravitational darkening effect should be included in realistic models of the atmospheres of the neutron stars.

<title>The Interaction between Stars and Past AGN Disk: Possible Explanation for the Kinematic Distributions of S-stars in the Galactic Center</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The presence of young stars, aged around several million years and situated within the range of ∼0.04–1 pc from our Galactic center raises a question about their origins and dynamical evolutions. Their kinematics provide an opportunity to explore their formation or possible subsequent dynamical evolution. If Sagittarius A* was active in the past as suggested by several observations, the accretion disk may have a significant impact on the dynamics of stars in the Galactic center. The drag force exerted on stars during star–disk interaction could lead some of them to sink into the accretion disk, and these embedded stars will rapidly migrate inward and eventually be disrupted within ∼105 yr. This could roughly explain the absence of stars within 2.5 × 104Rg (∼1000 au). Additionally, Kozai–Lidov oscillations, induced by the gravitational perturbation of the disk, could contribute to the bimodal distribution of S-star inclinations and drive a majority of stars into high-eccentricity orbits.

<title>The Study of Mode-switching Behavior of PSR J0614+2229 Using the Parkes Ultra–wide-bandwidth Receiver Observations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this paper we present a detailed single-pulse and polarization study of PSR J0614+2229 based on the archived data observed on 2019 August 15 (MJD 58710) and 2019 September 12 (MJD 58738) using the ultra−wide-bandwidth low-frequency receiver on the Parkes radio telescope. The single-pulse sequences show that this pulsar switches between two emission states, in which the emission of state A occurs earlier than that of state B in pulse longitude. We found that the variation in relative brightness between the two states varies temporally and both states follow a simple power law very well. Based on the phase-aligned multifrequency profiles, we found that there is a significant difference in the distributions of spectral index across the emission regions of the two states. Furthermore, we obtained the emission height evolution for the two emission states and found that, at a fixed frequency, the emission height of state A is higher than that of state B. What is even more interesting is that the emission heights of both states A and B do not change with frequency. Our results suggest that the mode switching of this pulsar is possibly caused by changes in the emission heights that alter the distributions of spectral index across the emission regions of states A and B, resulting in frequency-dependent behaviors, i.e., intensity and pulse width.

The magnetic fields in our Milky Way can be revealed by the distribution of Faraday rotation measures (RMs) of radio sources behind the Galaxy and of radio pulsars inside the Galaxy. Based on the antisymmetry of the Faraday sky in the inner Galaxy to the Galactic coordinates, the magnetic field toroids above and below the Galactic plane with reversed field directions exist in the Galactic halo and have been included in almost all models for the global magnetic structure in the Milky Way. However, the quantitative parameters—such as the field strength, the scale height, and the scale radius of the toroids—are hard to determine from observational data. It has long been argued that the RM antisymmetry could be dominated by the local contributions of the interstellar medium. Here, we get the local-discounted RM contributions from the RM sky and RMs of pulsars and get the first quantitative estimate of the sizes of the magnetic toroids in the Galactic halo. They are huge, starting from a Galactocentric radius of less than 2 kpc and extending to at least 15 kpc, without field direction reversals. Such magnetic toroids in the Galactic halo should naturally constrain the physical processes in galaxies.

<title>Primordial Black Hole–Neutron Star Merger Rate in Modified Gravity</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this work, we investigate the merger rate of primordial black hole–neutron star (PBH-NS) binaries in two widely studied modified gravity (MG) models: Hu–Sawicki f(R) gravity and the normal branch of Dvali–Gabadadze–Porrati gravity. In our analysis, we take into account the effects of MG on the halo properties, including halo mass function, halo concentration parameter, halo density profile, and velocity dispersion of dark matter particles. We find that these MG models, due to their stronger gravitational field induced by an effective fifth force, predict enhanced merger rates compared to general relativity. This enhancement is found to be redshift-dependent and sensitive to model parameters and PBH mass and fraction. Assuming a PBH mass range of 5–50 M⊙, we compare the predicted merger rate of PBH-NS binaries with those inferred from LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA observations of gravitational waves (GWs). We find that the merger rates obtained from MG models will be consistent with the GW observations if the abundance of PBHs is relatively large, with the exact amount depending on the MG model and its parameter values, as well as PBH mass. We also establish upper limits on the abundance of PBHs in these MG frameworks while comparing them with the existing non-GW constraints, which can potentially impose even more stringent constraints.

<title>21 cm Intensity Mapping with the DSA-2000</title>

Line-intensity mapping is a promising probe of the Universe’s large-scale structure. We explore the sensitivity of the DSA-2000, a forthcoming array consisting of over 2000 dishes, to the statistical power spectrum of neutral hydrogen’s 21 cm emission line. These measurements would reveal the distribution of neutral hydrogen throughout the near-redshift Universe without necessitating resolving individual sources. The success of these measurements relies on the instrument’s sensitivity and resilience to systematics. We show that the DSA-2000 will have the sensitivity needed to detect the 21 cm power spectrum at z ≈ 0.5 and across power spectrum modes of 0.03–35.12 h Mpc−1 with 0.1 h Mpc−1 resolution. We find that supplementing the nominal array design with a dense core of 200 antennas will expand its sensitivity at low power spectrum modes and enable measurement of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations. Finally, we present a qualitative discussion of the DSA-2000's unique resilience to sources of systematic error that can preclude 21 cm intensity mapping.

Classical machine learning has been actively utilized in astronomy to address various challenges, including predicting orbital stability, classifying asteroids, galaxies, and other objects, and analyzing images. However, the emerging trend in artificial intelligence involves the use of large language models such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT. These models are trained on a large corpus of text and can perform a wide range of natural language processing tasks, including text generation, translation, summarization, and classification. Surprisingly, these capabilities present significant potential for application in astronomy. This paper demonstrates how the new model gpt-4-vision-preview can analyze visual patterns and accurately classify asteroids as resonant or nonresonant with high accuracy. This process requires no training, fine-tuning, or coding beyond writing the appropriate prompt in natural language. Moreover, this approach can be extended to other common problems within astronomy.

<title>Pressure Balance and Energy Budget of the Nuclear Superbubble of NGC 3079</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Superbubbles in the nuclear region of galaxies could be produced by active galactic nuclei (AGN) or nuclear starburst via different driving forces. We report analysis of the multiwavelength data of the kiloparsec-scale nuclear superbubble in NGC 3079 in order to probe the mechanisms driving the expansion of the superbubble. Based on the Chandra X-ray observations, we derive the hot-gas thermal pressure inside the bubble, which is about 1 order of magnitude higher than that of the warm ionized gas traced by optical lines. We derive a [C ii]-based star formation rate (SFR) of SFR ∼ 1.3 M⊙ yr−1 from the nuclear region using the SOFIA/FIFI-LS observation. This SFR infers a radiation pressure toward the bubble shells much lower than the thermal pressure of the gases. The Very Large Array radio image infers that magnetic pressure at the northeast cap above the superbubble is less than the thermal pressure of the hot gas enclosed in the bubble but has a clearly larger extension. The magnetic field may thus still help to reconcile the expansion of the bubble. The observed thermal energy of the hot gas enclosed in the bubble requires an energy injection rate of ≳1042 erg s−1 within the bubble’s dynamical age, which is probably larger than the power provided by the current nuclear starburst and the parsec-scale jet. If this is true, stronger past AGN activity may provide an alternative energy source to drive the observed bubble expansion.

<div> 关键词: James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, JCMT, 相对校准, 星体形成区, 亚毫米波段

总结: 
James Clerk Maxwell 望远镜的瞬变调查监测了8个古尔德带低质量星体形成区和6个更远的中等质量星体形成区。他们引入了v2流程的相对校准程序，可以在不同时段对影像进行对齐和通量校准。这些新技术在850μm和450μm波段都起作用，并且比v1版本减小了测量误差，并提供了额外的稳健性。相对图像校准达到了比亚毫米波束宽度更小的0.″5的精度。v2的相对通量校准在850μm时是1%，在450μm时小于5%。通过比较两个流程，他们证明了校准的改进，并且可以识别出更多的稳健变量。在6年的观测中，他们发现了四个稳健变量，所有这些在850μm和450μm波段都稳定。多波段光变曲线显示，这些变化与中心源的吸积光度变化导致包层内尘埃的加热有关。 <div>
The James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) Transient Survey has been monitoring eight Gould Belt low-mass star-forming regions since 2015 December and six somewhat more distant intermediate-mass star-forming regions since 2020 February with the Submillimeter Common User Bolometer Array 2 on board JCMT at 450 and 850 μm and with an approximately monthly cadence. We introduce our pipeline v2 relative calibration procedures for image alignment and flux calibration across epochs, improving on our previous pipeline v1 by decreasing measurement uncertainties and providing additional robustness. These new techniques work at both 850 and 450 μm, where version 1 only allowed investigation of the 850 μm data. Pipeline v2 achieves better than 0.″5 relative image alignment, less than a tenth of the submillimeter beam widths. The version 2 relative flux calibration is found to be 1% at 850 μm and <5% at 450 μm. The improvement in the calibration is demonstrated by comparing the two pipelines over the first 4 yr of the survey and recovering additional robust variables with version 2. Using the full 6 yr of the Gould Belt survey, the number of robust variables increases by 50%, and at 450 μm we identify four robust variables, all of which are also robust at 850 μm. The multiwavelength light curves for these sources are investigated and found to be consistent with the variability being due to dust heating within the envelope in response to accretion luminosity changes from the central source.

总结:  
Vera Rubin Observatory即将进行的Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)将为我们提供一次快速调查南半球光学波段的新机会。研究旨在利用LSST观测来约束伽马射线暴余辉和Kilonova（KN）合并光变曲线对不同KN喷流组分的质量和速度进行观测。利用模拟的光变曲线样本进行研究发现，最佳的观测策略是以高频率访问，每隔两晚进行一次4小时的观测，并在至少三个滤光片中收集观测数据。这种观测策略将允许我们识别光变曲线的不同阶段，并有效收集观测数据。 <div>
The upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) opens a new opportunity to rapidly survey the southern sky at optical wavelengths (i.e., ugrizy bands). In this study, we aim to test the possibility of using LSST observations to constrain the mass and velocity of different kilonova (KN) ejecta components from the observation of a combined set of light curves from afterglows of γ-ray bursts and KNe. We used a sample of simulated light curves from the aforementioned events as they would have been seen during the LSST survey to study how the choice of observing strategies impacts the parameter estimation. We found that the design of observing strategy that is the best compromise between light-curve coverage, observed filters, and reliability of the fit involves a high number of visits with long-gap pairs of about 4 hr every two nights in the same or different filters. The features of the observing strategy will allow us to recognize the different stages of the evolution of the light curve and gather observations in at least three filters.

该研究分析了Chandra和Suzaku对球状星团Terzan 6的观测，发现了一个新的X射线双星源Terzan 6 X2，位于GSR 1747-312附近。通过Suzaku的光变曲线，确定了X2的轨道周期大于16.27小时。X2的光度在0.24-5.9 × 10^34 erg s-1范围内变化。研究还在Hubble Space Telescope的图像中发现了X2的可能光学伴星，该伴星在颜色-等级图中处于蓝串挨星者区域。从罗奇裂叶星的轨道周期-密度关系推断出质捐星的半径大于0.8 R⊙。
<br /><br />总结: 该研究利用Chandra和Suzaku观测，发现了球状星团Terzan 6中的一个新的X射线双星源Terzan 6 X2，其轨道周期明确大于16.27小时。X2的光度在不同时期有显著变化，同时在Hubble Space Telescope的图像中找到了X2的可能光学伴星。根据分析推断出质捐星的半径大约大于0.8 R⊙。 <div>
We have analyzed Chandra and Suzaku observations of the globular cluster Terzan 6, made when the recurrent transient GRS 1747–312 was in quiescence. Our analysis reveals the presence of a second eclipsing, bursting neutron star low-mass X-ray binary in the central regions of the cluster, in addition to GRS 1747–312. The new source, which we name Terzan 6 X2, is located only ∼0.″7 away from GRS 1747–312 in the 2021 Chandra images. The detection of a 5.14 ks long eclipse in the light curve of X2 at a time not predicted by the ephemeris of GRS 1747–312 confirms that it is an unrelated source. Using the Suzaku light curve from 2009, which, in addition to a type I X-ray burst, also showed an eclipse-like feature, we constrain the orbital period to be longer than 16.27 hr. The 0.5–10 keV luminosities of X2 vary in the range of ∼0.24–5.9 × 1034 erg s−1 on timescales of months to years. We have identified a plausible optical counterpart of X2 in Hubble Space Telescope F606W and F814W images. This star varied by 2.7 mag in V606 between epochs separated by years. In the cluster color–magnitude diagram, the variable counterpart lies in the blue-straggler region when it was optically bright, about 1.1–1.7 mag above the main-sequence turn-off. From the orbital period–density relation of Roche-lobe filling stars, we find the mass-donor radius to be ≳0.8 R⊙.

总结:
在这项研究中，研究人员使用了零范围斯格米互作用的非相对论核物质模型，并利用贝叶斯方法研究了中子星的状态方程行为。研究中对核物理和从头计算的纯中子物质的约束条件进行了最小化，并考虑了因果关系以及中子星最大质量的下限。研究发现，考虑通常被忽视的纯中子物质能量在不同密度下的相关性，有效地约束了高密度状态方程的行为。研究还发现，一系列中子星的全局性质与纯中子物质在0.16 fm^-3时的有效中子质量值相关。我们的工作有助于更好地理解中子星状态方程以及其与密集核物质性质的联系。<br /><br /> <div>
The nonrelativistic model of nuclear matter (NM) with zero-range Skyrme interactions is employed within a Bayesian approach in order to study the behavior of the neutron star (NS) equation of state (EOS). A minimal number of constraints from nuclear physics and ab initio calculations of pure neutron matter (PNM) are imposed together with causality and a lower limit on the maximum mass of an NS to all our models. Our key result is that accounting for correlations among the values that the energy per neutron in PNM takes at various densities and that are typically disregarded efficiently constrains the behavior of the EOS at high densities. A series of global NS properties, e.g., maximum mass, central density of the maximum mass configuration, minimum NS mass that allows for direct URCA, and radii of intermediate and massive NSs, appear to be correlated with the value of effective neutron mass in PNM at 0.16 fm−3. Together with similar studies in the literature our work contributes to a better understanding of the NS EOS as well as its link with the properties of dense NM.

研究报告发现了Sombrero星系（NGC 4594）中的10千秒尺度的射电叶，利用了“邻近星系中的连续辐射增强射电幅射”项目的数据。研究者进一步研究了叶内磁压力和周围热气体的热压力之间的平衡。在半径r约为（1-10）kpc处，叶内磁压力和周围热气体的热压力通常是平衡的。这意味着喷流可以扩展到周围，至少到r约10kpc。负责大尺度叶的活跃星系核喷流的反馈可能有助于解释这个宏大、清静独立的盘状星系异常高的X射线亮度，尽管需要更多理论工作来进一步检验这种可能性。 <div>
We report the discovery of the 10 kpc scale radio lobes in the Sombrero galaxy (NGC 4594), using data from the Continuum Halos in Nearby Galaxies—an Expanded Very Large Array Survey project. We further examine the balance between the magnetic pressure inside the lobes and the thermal pressure of the ambient hot gas. At the radii r of ∼(1–10) kpc, the magnetic pressure inside the lobes and the thermal pressure of the ambient hot gas are generally in balance. This implies that the jets could expand into the surroundings to at least r ∼ 10 kpc. The feedback from the active galactic nucleus jet responsible for the large-scale lobes may help to explain the unusually high X-ray luminosity of this massive quiescent isolated disk galaxy, although more theoretical work is needed to further examine this possibility.

<div> 核坍缩超新星，r-过程核合成，光度曲线，探测性，天文观测

总结:
核心坍缩超新星（SNe）可能是r-过程核合成的快速中子俘获过程（r-过程）的候选地点。研究了r-过程核素对富氢SNe的光度曲线的影响，并评估了这些特征的可探测性。修改了辐射流体动力学代码SuperNova Explosion Code，以包括来自超新星（SN）喷发的r-过程元素的近似效应的光度和放射性加热。我们提出了一系列总量r-过程质量Mr的模型以及它们在喷发物中的径向分布，发现对比于普通富氢SNe（不含r-过程元素），Mr≳10−2M⊙足以在它们的光度曲线上产生明显差异。r-过程富集的主要光度特征包括平台阶段的缩短，与氢复合光球撤退到富含r-过程的层相符，并伴随着SN颜色的加红导致的平台后下降更为陡峭。我们将r-过程富集的模型与普通SNe模型和观测数据进行比较，表明当r-过程富含层至少混合到喷射表面的一半时，Mr≳10−2M⊙的产量可能通过瞬变观测者使用的几个指标被检测到。假设仅有一小部分SNe产生了可探测的Mr≳10−2M⊙的r-过程产出，并且尊重对银河总产出率的约束，我们估计需要观测≳103–104个SNe才能发现一个r-富集事件，这一壮举可能会在弗拉·鲁宾天文台实现。 <div>
Core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are candidate sites for rapid neutron capture process (r-process) nucleosynthesis. We explore the effects of enrichment from r-process nuclei on the light curves of hydrogen-rich SNe and assess the detectability of these signatures. We modify the radiation hydrodynamics code, SuperNova Explosion Code, to include the approximate effects of opacity and radioactive heating from r-process elements in the supernova (SN) ejecta. We present models spanning a range of total r-process masses Mr and their assumed radial distribution within the ejecta, finding that Mr ≳ 10−2M⊙ is sufficient to induce appreciable differences in their light curves as compared to ordinary hydrogen-rich SNe (without any r-process elements). The primary photometric signatures of r-process enrichment include a shortening of the plateau phase, coinciding with the hydrogen-recombination photosphere retreating to the r-process-enriched layers, and a steeper post-plateau decline associated with a reddening of the SN colors. We compare our r-process-enriched models to ordinary SNe models and observational data, showing that yields of Mr ≳ 10−2M⊙ are potentially detectable across several of the metrics used by transient observers, provided that r-process-rich layers are mixed at least halfway to the ejecta surface. This detectability threshold can roughly be reproduced analytically using a two-zone (kilonova-within-an-SN) picture. Assuming that a small fraction of SNe produce a detectable r-process yield of Mr ≳ 10−2M⊙, and respecting constraints on the total Galactic production rate, we estimate that ≳103–104 SNe need be observed to find one r-enriched event, a feat that may become possible with the Vera Rubin Observatory.

总结:
超新星爆发造成星系中元素的丰富，而一些超新星可能会留下黑洞。在双星系统中，超新星会污染其伴星，并且黑洞可能会重新吸积自身的碎片并发射X射线。通过测量风中元素的丰度可以推断出历史爆发的情况，并可能识别出已经消失的原恒星。该研究重新分析了2005年GRO J1655−40的爆发的X射线光谱。他们重建了风的吸收度分布(AMD)，发现它随电离度从类氢氧增加到类氢钙，然后趋于平缓。使用AMD来测量18种不同元素的相对丰度。目前的丰度在某种程度上与先前的研究一致，但低Z元素存在差异。奇Z元素的过丰度提示了高金属丰度和高质量(≃25 M⊙)的原星。这些丰度与伴星大气中测量到的不同，表明风中夹杂着残留的超新星碎片，这是可以预期的，因为当前双星系统的总质量(<10 M⊙)比原星质量小得多。 <div>
Supernovae are responsible for the elemental enrichment of the galaxy, and some are postulated to leave behind a black hole. In a stellar binary system, the supernova pollutes its companion, and the black hole can accrete back its own debris and emit X-rays. In this sequence of events, which is only poorly understood, winds are ejected and observed through X-ray absorption lines. Measuring abundances of elements in the wind can lead to inferences about the historical explosion and possibly identify the long-gone progenitor of the compact object. Here, we reanalyze the uniquely rich X-ray spectrum of the 2005 outburst of GRO J1655−40. We reconstruct the absorption measure distribution (AMD) of the wind and find that it increases sharply with ionization from H-like O up to H-like Ca and then flattens out. The AMD is then used to measure the relative abundances of 18 different elements. The present abundances are in partial agreement with a previous work with discrepancies mostly for low-Z elements. The overabundance of odd-Z elements hints at a high-metallicity, high-mass (≃25 M⊙) progenitor. Interestingly, the abundances are different from those measured in the companion atmosphere, indicating that the wind entrains lingering ambient supernova debris. This can be expected since the current total stellar mass of the binary (<10 M⊙) is much less than the progenitor mass.

这项研究利用James Webb Space Telescope/NIRCam在Ultra Deep Survey Field中观测到了10个光谱确认的Lyα辐射体(LAEs)，它们在F090W到F444W波段均有探测，对应的是2200 Å到1.2 μm的静止波长。根据F200W图像，发现有3个目标被分辨为分离小于0.″9的成对系统，另外3个显示不对称结构。构建了这些LAEs的光谱能量分布(SEDs)，显示出几乎没有灭绝。所有来源，包括成对系统，都显示出类似的SED形状，在F200W波段有明显的流量过量，对应着极强的[O iii]+Hβ发射线(EWrest = 740–6500 Å)。样本的中值有效半径、恒星质量和紫外线斜率分别为0.36 kpc、3.8 × 107M⊙和−2.48。平均爆发年龄由恒星质量除以恒星形成速率估计为<40 Myr。这些测量结果揭示了一个引人注目的恒星爆发的矮星系群体，偏离了z ∼ 3的标度关系的外推: 在星形成主序上方约0.7 dex， 在质量-尺寸关系下方约0.35 dex，并且在UV斜率上比具有类似UV亮度的typical高z星系更偏蓝。我们推测这些数字可能需要在向矮星系群体的星爆偏移处需要更大的主序散射或尾部。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究利用James Webb Space Telescope/NIRCam观测到了10个光谱确认的Lyα辐射体(LAEs)，它们显示出非常强的[O iii]+Hβ发射线。这些LAEs构成了一个引人注目的矮星系群体，其性质偏离了已知的标度关系。 <div>
We study 10 spectroscopically confirmed Lyα emitters (LAEs) at z ≈ 3.1 in the Ultra Deep Survey field, covered by the James Webb Space Telescope/NIRCam in the Public Release Imaging for Extragalactic Research program. All LAEs are detected in all NIRCam bands from F090W to F444W, corresponding to rest frame wavelengths of 2200 Å to 1.2 μm. Based on morphological analysis of the F200W images, three out of the 10 targets are resolved into pair-like systems with separations of <0.″9, and another three show asymmetric structures. We then construct the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these LAEs, which show little to no extinction. All sources, including the pairs, show similar SED shapes, with a prominent flux excess in the F200W band, corresponding to extremely strong [O iii]+Hβ emission lines (EWrest = 740–6500 Å). The median effective radii, stellar mass, and UV slope of our sample are 0.36 kpc, 3.8 × 107M⊙, and −2.48, respectively. The average burst age, estimated by stellar mass over star formation rate, is <40 Myr. These measurements reveal an intriguing starbursting dwarf galaxy population lying off the extrapolations of the z ∼ 3 scaling relations to the low-mass end: ∼0.7 dex above the star-forming main sequence, ∼0.35 dex below the mass–size relation, and bluer in the UV slope than typical high-z galaxies at similar UV luminosities. We speculate that these numbers may require a larger main-sequence scatter or tail in the dwarf galaxy regime toward the starburst outliers.

<div> 关键词: 变量源、时间属性、周期性、光度曲线、伽马射线暴

这项研究比较了高斯过程、功率谱和小波分析三种方法在处理周期性或准周期性行为时的效果，分别使用celerite、Lomb-Scargle周期图和加权小波Z变换。该研究以15个快速伽马射线暴（sGRBs）的X射线望远镜光度曲线为例进行了综合分析。研究结果揭示了人为因素在分析中引入的假准周期振荡信号等伪迹的重要性，这些因素可能来自预处理（如去趋势化）或分析的其他方面。本文描述的探索对未来对伽马射线暴、活动星系核以及其他天文源的变化性研究将会有所帮助。<br /><br />总结: 该研究比较了不同方法对变量源时间属性的处理效果，发现人为因素可能引入假信号，可能对未来相关研究有帮助。 <div>
The study of temporal properties of variable sources can elucidate their physical processes. In this context, we present a critical study comparing three approaches to periodic or quasiperiodic behavior: Gaussian process, power spectrum, and wavelet analysis, using celerite, Lomb–Scargle periodograms, and weighted wavelet Z-transforms, respectively. We use 15 Swift X-ray Telescope light curves of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) as examples. A comprehensive analysis of two sGRB X-ray light curves is performed. The results reveal the importance of artifacts, largely in the form of false quasiperiodic oscillation signals, possibly introduced by preprocessing (such as detrending) or other aspects of the analysis. The exploration described in this paper can be helpful for future studies of variability in gamma-ray bursts, active galactic nuclei, and other astronomical sources.

The standard flare model, despite its success, is limited in comprehensively explaining the various processes involving nonthermal particles. One such missing ingredient is a detailed understanding of the various processes involved during the transport of accelerated electrons from their site of acceleration to different parts of the flare region. Here we use simultaneous radio and X-ray observations from the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array and the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays on board the Solar Orbiter, respectively, from two distinct viewing perspectives, to study the electron transport processes. Through detailed spectral modeling of the coronal source using radio data and footpoint sources using X-ray spectra, we compare the nonthermal electron distribution at the coronal and footpoint sources. We find that the flux of the nonthermal electrons precipitated at the footpoint is an order of magnitude greater than that trapped in the looptop, consistent with earlier works that primarily used X-ray for their studies. In addition, we find that the electron spectral indices obtained from X-ray footpoints are significantly softer than the spectral hardness of the nonthermal electron distribution in the corona. We interpret these differences based on transport effects and the difference in sensitivity of microwave and X-ray observations to different regimes of electron energies. Such an understanding is crucial for leveraging different diagnostic methods of nonthermal electrons simultaneously to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the electron acceleration and transport processes of solar flares.

<title>Discovery of Optically Emitting Circumgalactic Nebulae around the Majority of UV-luminous Quasars at Intermediate Redshift</title>

<div> quasars, [O ii]-emitting nebulae, circumgalactic gas, MUSE, redshift<br />
总结:<br />
研究发现在30个UV亮度类星体中，大多数存在着大型的离子化[O ii]发射星周星云。这些星周星云的大小与类星体的红移、亮度、黑洞质量或者射电强度之间没有明显的相关性，但可能与类星体光谱中[O ii]等效宽度相关。在z≈1的类星体周围的星周星云较小且较少，可能是由于中性气体散射、星周星云冷气体含量的演化、围绕z≈1的类星体的较大尺度金属含量低于预期，或者z=3和1之间的类星体寿命变化。 <div>
We report the discovery of large, ionized, [O ii]-emitting circumgalactic nebulae around the majority of 30 UV-luminous quasars at z = 0.4–1.4 observed with deep, wide-field integral field spectroscopy with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopy Explorer (MUSE) by the Cosmic Ultraviolet Baryon Survey and MUSE Quasar Blind Emitters Survey. Among the 30 quasars, seven (23%) exhibit [O ii]-emitting nebulae with major axis sizes greater than 100 kpc, 20 greater than 50 kpc (67%), and 27 (90%) greater than 20 kpc. Such large, optically emitting nebulae indicate that cool, dense, and metal-enriched circumgalactic gas is common in the halos of luminous quasars at intermediate redshift. Several of the largest nebulae exhibit morphologies that suggest interaction-related origins. We detect no correlation between the sizes and cosmological-dimming-corrected surface brightnesses of the nebulae and quasar redshift, luminosity, black hole mass, or radio-loudness, but find a tentative correlation between the nebulae and rest-frame [O ii] equivalent width in the quasar spectra. This potential trend suggests a relationship between interstellar medium content and gas reservoirs on CGM scales. The [O ii]-emitting nebulae around the z ≈ 1 quasars are smaller and less common than Lyα nebulae around z ≈ 3 quasars. These smaller sizes can be explained if the outer regions of the Lyα halos arise from scattering in more neutral gas, by evolution in the cool circumgalactic medium content of quasar-host halos, by lower-than-expected metallicities on ≳50 kpc scales around z ≈ 1 quasars, or by changes in quasar episodic lifetimes between z = 3 and 1.

总结:
IRAS04368+2557是L1527中的一个0/I类原恒星，其具有明显的盘-包层系统，先前的ALMA观测揭示了这一特征。本文讨论了这一源的膨胀结构，包括FAUST ALMA大型项目中观测到的含硫分子。分子分布和动力学的分析表明，CS、SO和OCS追踪盘-包层系统的不同区域。通过两条观测到的SO谱线推导旋转温度，温度分布显示出明显的膨胀“蝴蝶”结构，较高的温度约为50K，中心较低的温度区域（<30K）与连续谱峰值重合，暗示动力学产生的加热而非来自中心原恒星的辐射加热。其他物理性质，包括柱密度，也被估算并进一步用于展示盘-包层系统的垂直结构。我们的分析确认了L1527的“扭曲”盘结构，显示含硫分子不仅是有效的材料探针，而且对原恒星系统的结构研究也足够充分。 <div>
IRAS04368+2557 in L1527 is a Class 0/I protostar with a clear disk-envelope system revealed by previous Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations. In this paper, we discuss the flared structure of this source with observed sulfur-bearing molecules included in the FAUST ALMA large program. The analyses of molecular distributions and kinematics have shown that CS, SO, and OCS trace different regions of the disk-envelope system. To evaluate the temperature across the disk, we derive rotation temperature with the two observed SO lines. The temperature profile shows a clear, flared “butterfly” structure with the higher temperature being ∼50 K and the central lower temperature region (<30 K) coinciding with the continuum peak, suggesting dynamically originated heating rather than radiation heating from the central protostar. Other physical properties, including column densities, are also estimated and further used to demonstrate the vertical structure of the disk-envelope system. The “warped” disk structure of L1527 is confirmed with our analyses, showing that sulfur-bearing molecules are not only effective material probes but also sufficient for structural studies of protostellar systems.

<title>Revisiting the Vertical Distribution of H i Absorbing Clouds in the Solar Neighborhood</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The vertical distribution of cold neutral hydrogen (H i) clouds is a constraint on models of the structure, dynamics, and hydrostatic balance of the interstellar medium. In 1978, Crovisier pioneered a method to infer the vertical distribution of H i absorbing clouds in the solar neighborhood. Using data from the Nançay 21 cm absorption survey, Crovisier determined the mean vertical displacement of cold H i clouds, 〈∣z∣〉. We revisit that author’s analysis and explore the consequences of truncating the H i absorption sample in Galactic latitude. For any nonzero latitude limit, we find that the quantity inferred by Crovisier is not the mean vertical displacement but rather a ratio involving higher moments of the vertical distribution. The resultant distribution scale heights are thus ∼1.5 to ∼3 times smaller than previously determined. In light of this discovery, we develop a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain method to infer the vertical distribution of H i absorbing clouds. We fit our model to the original Nançay data and find a vertical distribution moment ratio 〈∣z∣3〉/〈∣z∣2〉 = 97 ± 15 pc, which corresponds to a Gaussian scale height σz = 61 ± 9 pc, an exponential scale height λz = 32 ± 5 pc, and a rectangular half-width Wz,1/2 = 129 ± 20 pc. Consistent with recent simulations, the vertical scale height of cold H i clouds appears to remain constant between the inner Galaxy and the Galactocentric distance of the solar neighborhood. Local fluctuations might explain the large-scale height observed at the same Galactocentric distance on the far side of the Galaxy.

<title>TriOS Schwarzschild Orbit Modeling: Robustness of Parameter Inference for Masses and Shapes of Triaxial Galaxies with Supermassive Black Holes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Evidence for the majority of the supermassive black holes in the local Universe has been obtained dynamically from stellar motions with the Schwarzschild orbit superposition method. However, there have been only a handful of studies using simulated data to examine the ability of this method to reliably recover known input black hole masses MBH and other galaxy parameters. Here, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of the reliability of the triaxial Schwarzschild method at simultaneously determining MBH, stellar mass-to-light ratio M*/L, dark matter mass, and three intrinsic triaxial shape parameters of simulated galaxies. For each of 25 rounds of mock observations using simulated stellar kinematics and the TriOS code, we derive best-fitting parameters and confidence intervals after a full search in the 6D parameter space with our likelihood-based model inference scheme. The two key mass parameters, MBH and M*/L, are recovered within the 68% confidence interval, and other parameters are recovered between the 68% and 95% confidence intervals. The spatially varying velocity anisotropy of the stellar orbits is also well recovered. We explore whether the goodness-of-fit measure used for galaxy model selection in our pipeline is biased by variable complexity across the 6D parameter space. In our tests, adding a penalty term to the likelihood measure either makes little difference, or worsens the recovery in some cases.

<div> GRB, XRT, early X-ray emissions, cosmological time dilation, BdHN<br />
总结:<br />
这篇文章讨论了通过利用宇宙时间膨胀来观测早期伽马射线暴中的X射线辐射。研究发现，在三个GRB事件中成功观测到了极早期的X射线余辉辐射，验证了二元驱动超新星(BdHN)场景中碳氧核坍缩和新生中子星形成导致GRB事件的观测。此外，分析长 GRB 红移分布，推断出 Bdhne II 和 III 可能是短 GRB 的中子星二进制源。此外还研究了 νNS 的自转速率和其与引力波信号的相关性。 <div>
The repointing time of the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) instrument on the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory satellite has posed challenges in observing and studying the early X-ray emissions within ≈40 s after a gamma-ray burst (GRB) trigger. To address this issue, we adopt a novel approach that capitalizes on the cosmological time dilation in GRBs with redshifts ranging from 3 to 9. Applying this strategy to Swift/XRT data, we investigate the earliest X-ray emissions of 368 GRBs from the Swift catalog, including short and long GRBs. We compare the observed time delay between the GRB trigger and the initial Swift/XRT observation, measured in the GRB observer frame, and the corresponding cosmological rest-frame time delay (RTD). This technique is here used in the analysis of GRB 090423 at z = 8.233 (RTD ∼8.2 s), GRB 090429B at z ≈ 9.4 (RTD ∼10.1 s), and GRB 220101A at z = 4.61 (RTD ∼14.4 s). The cosmological time dilation enables us to observe the very early X-ray afterglow emission in these three GRBs. We thus validate the observation of the collapse of the carbon–oxygen core and the coeval newborn neutron star (νNS) formation triggering the GRB event in the binary-driven hypernova (BdHN) scenario. We also evidence the νNS spin-up due to supernova ejecta fallback and its subsequent slowing down due to the X-ray/optical/radio synchrotron afterglow emission. A brief gravitational-wave signal may separate the two stages owing to a fast-spinning νNS triaxial-to-axisymmetric transition. We also analyze the long GRB redshift distribution for the different BdHN types and infer that BdHNe II and III may originate the NS binary progenitors of short GRBs.

We present evidence supporting wave reflection in the lower solar chromosphere based on helioseismic analysis of multi-height Doppler data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager and the Magneto-Optical filters at Two Heights II instrument. This evidence is derived through a wave propagation model that incorporates both upward- and downward-traveling (reflected) waves. Moreover, we find that the height of the reflecting region varies with magnetic field strengths in a way that suggests a connection with the plasma β ∼ 1 region. We measure an effective reflection coefficient of 13% in a magnetically quiet region of the Sun.

<div> JWST, LLAGN, MIRI, NGC 1052, Sombrero
总结:<br /><br />该研究报告了ReveaLLAGN调查的首批结果，重点关注了七个附近低光度活动星系核（LLAGN）的研究。研究使用JWST的中红外仪器（MIRI）的中分辨率光谱仪观测了NGC 1052和NGC 4594/M104（Sombrero）的核区，并将这些数据与更高光度AGN的公开JWST数据进行了比较。研究发现JWST清晰地将AGN光谱与星系光分离，即使是在最暗淡的Sombrero中也能做到；AGN成分具有非常红色的光谱。此外，NGC 1052和Sombrero中的发射线宽随着电离势的增加而增加，对于电离势≳50 eV的线宽达到FWHM > 1000 km s−1。这些特征以及两个星系中的发射线图与喷流方向一致，表明存在沿着喷流方向的流出现象。Sombrero中的[Ne v]和[O iv]是迄今为止在中红外中测量到的最低光度高电离势线，但是这些线的相对强度与更高光度AGN的相一致。然而，[Ne v]发射线相对于[Ne iii]和[Ne ii]线要弱得多。这些初步结果展示了JWST对于识别和研究LLAGN的物理本质的巨大潜力。 <div>
We present the first results from the Revealing Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (ReveaLLAGN) survey, a JWST survey of seven nearby LLAGNs. We focus on two observations with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI)’s Medium-Resolution Spectrometer of the nuclei of NGC 1052 and Sombrero (NGC 4594/M104). We also compare these data to public JWST data of higher-luminosity AGNs, NGC 7319 and NGC 7469. JWST clearly separates the AGN spectrum from the galaxy light even in Sombrero, the faintest target in our survey; the AGN components have very red spectra. We find that the emission-line widths in both NGC 1052 and Sombrero increase with increasing ionization potential, with FWHM > 1000 km s−1 for lines with ionization potential ≳ 50 eV. These lines are also significantly blueshifted in both LLAGNs. The high-ionization-potential lines in NGC 7319 show neither broad widths nor significant blueshifts. Many of the lower-ionization-potential emission lines in Sombrero show significant blue wings extending >1000 km s−1. These features and the emission-line maps in both galaxies are consistent with outflows along the jet direction. Sombrero has the lowest-luminosity high-ionization-potential lines ([Ne v] and [O iv]) ever measured in the mid-infrared, but the relative strengths of these lines are consistent with higher-luminosity AGNs. On the other hand, the [Ne v] emission is much weaker relative to the [Ne iii] and [Ne ii] lines of higher-luminosity AGNs. These initial results show the great promise that JWST holds for identifying and studying the physical nature of LLAGNs.

Multipeaked supernovae with precursors, dramatic light-curve rebrightenings, and spectral transformation are rare, but are being discovered in increasing numbers by modern night-sky transient surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility. Here, we present the observations and analysis of SN 2023aew, which showed a dramatic increase in brightness following an initial luminous (−17.4 mag) and long (∼100 days) unusual first peak (possibly precursor). SN 2023aew was classified as a Type IIb supernova during the first peak but changed its type to resemble a stripped-envelope supernova (SESN) after the marked rebrightening. We present comparisons of SN 2023aew’s spectral evolution with SESN subtypes and argue that it is similar to SNe Ibc during its main peak. P-Cygni Balmer lines are present during the first peak, but vanish during the second peak’s photospheric phase, before Hα resurfaces again during the nebular phase. The nebular lines ([O i], [Ca ii], Mg i], Hα) exhibit a double-peaked structure that hints toward a clumpy or nonspherical ejecta. We analyze the second peak in the light curve of SN 2023aew and find it to be broader than that of normal SESNe as well as requiring a very high 56Ni mass to power the peak luminosity. We discuss the possible origins of SN 2023aew including an eruption scenario where a part of the envelope is ejected during the first peak and also powers the second peak of the light curve through interaction of the SN with the circumstellar medium.

Motivated by the signatures of nonlinear electrostatic waves observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft mission in reconnection jet regions of Earth's magnetotail, we have explored the dynamical features of ion-acoustic shock waves in the magnetotail. In this investigation, we have examined the dynamics and characteristics of ion-acoustic subsonic shock waves in non-Maxwellian space plasma comprising of two counterstreaming ion beams with suprathermal electrons, assumed to follow a kappa (κ) distribution. A reductive perturbation technique has been adopted to establish an evolution equation for small amplitude electrostatic shock structures. Importantly, subsonic waves only exist when the beam velocity exceeds a certain threshold, beyond which supersonic and subsonic waves may coexist. The combined effects of the beam velocity and the non-Maxwellian electron statistics have been analyzed to examine the characteristics of subsonic shock waves. Both symmetric and asymmetric (in relative beam density) models have been considered, leading to distinct possibilities in the evolution of subsonic shock waves. The findings of the investigation will help unfold the relatively unexplored dynamical characteristics of subsonic shock waves that may form and propagate in the magnetosphere.

Solar active regions (ARs) contain a broad range of temperatures, with the thermal plasma distribution often observed to peak in the few millions of kelvin. Differential emission measure (DEM) analysis can allow instruments with diverse temperature responses to be used in concert to estimate this distribution. Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope ARray (NuSTAR) hard X-ray (HXR) observations are uniquely sensitive to the highest-temperature components of the corona, and thus extremely powerful for examining signatures of reconnection-driven heating. Here, we use NuSTAR diagnostics in combination with extreme-ultraviolet and soft X-ray observations (from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and Hinode/X-Ray Telescope) to construct DEMs over 170 distinct time intervals during a 5 hr observation of an alternately flaring and quiet active region (NOAA designation AR 12712). This represents the first HXR study to examine the time evolution of the distribution of thermal plasma in an AR. During microflares, we find that the initial microflare-associated plasma heating is predominantly heating of material that is already relatively hot, followed later on by broader heating of initially cooler material. During quiescent times, we show that the amount of extremely hot (>10 MK) material in this region is significantly (∼2–4 orders of magnitude) less than that found in the quiescent AR observed in HXRs by FOXSI-2. This result implies there can be radically different high-temperature thermal distributions in different ARs, and strongly motivates future HXR DEM studies covering a large number of these regions.

<div> MeerKAT DEEP2 field, redshifts, radio luminosity functions, star formation rate density (SFRD), systematic errors
<br /><br />总结:
研究对MeerKAT DEEP2领域中3839个星系进行了红移测定，发现在0.2 < z < 1.3范围内，无线电亮度函数与先前模型推断的结果一致，证实了在这个红移范围内基于无线电的星形成速率密度（SFRD）比基于紫外-红外的测量结果高出50%。文章讨论了系统误差，但即使考虑所有系统误差，也不能解释在0.5 < z < 1.3范围内基于无线电的SFRD测量与基于紫外-红外的测量之间的差异。作者得出结论，对宇宙中星形成预算的全面确认仍需大量工作。 <div>
We present the initial sample of redshifts for 3839 galaxies in the MeerKAT DEEP2 field—the most sensitive ∼1.4 GHz radio field yet observed with σn = 0.55 μ Jy beam−1, reaching the confusion limit. Using a spectrophotometric technique combining coarse optical spectra with broadband photometry, we obtain redshifts with σz ≲ 0.01(1 + z), as determined from repeat observations. The resulting radio luminosity functions between 0.2 < z < 1.3 from our sample of 3839 individual galaxies are in remarkable agreement with those inferred from previous modeling of radio source counts, confirming a ≳50% excess in radio-based star formation rate density (SFRD) (z) measurements at 0.2 < z < 1.3 compared to those from the UV–IR. Several sources of systematic error are discussed—totalling ∼0.13 dex when added in quadrature. Even in the event that all systematic errors work to decrease the radio-based SFRD values, they are incapable of reconciling differences between the radio-based measurements with those from the UV–IR at 0.5 < z < 1.3. We conclude that significant work remains to have confidence in a full accounting of the star formation budget of the Universe.

<div> Mon OB1, CO study, molecular gas, star-forming regions, GMC complex
<br /><br />总结:
本研究对Mon OB1区域进行了全面的CO研究，发现了复杂的分子气体结构和各种形态，通过高斯分解和聚类分析鉴定出263个13CO结构，并指出了密度较高的气体主要集中在多个13CO结构重叠的区域。结合Gaia DR3的数据，估算出巨大分子云复合体的平均距离，其总质量分别为1.1 × 105M⊙、4.3 × 104M⊙和8.4 × 103M⊙。研究结果显示星形成活动对周围分子气体的物理特性有着巨大影响，而同时分子气体环境也与附近的星形成区域密切相关。 <div>
We perform a comprehensive CO study toward the Monoceros OB1 (Mon OB1) region based on the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting survey at an angular resolution of about 50″. The high-sensitivity data, together with the high dynamic range, show that molecular gas in the 8° × 4° region displays complicated hierarchical structures and various morphology (e.g., filamentary, cavity-like, shell-like, and other irregular structures). Based on Gaussian decomposition and clustering for 13CO data, a total of 263 13CO structures are identified in the whole region, and 88% of raw data flux is recovered. The dense gas with relatively high column density from the integrated CO emission is mainly concentrated in the region where multiple 13CO structures are overlapped. Combining the results of 32 large 13CO structures with distances from Gaia DR3, we estimate an average distance of for the giant molecular cloud (GMC) complex. The total mass of the GMC complex traced by 12CO, 13CO, and C18O is 1.1 × 105M⊙, 4.3 × 104M⊙, and 8.4 × 103M⊙, respectively. The dense gas fraction shows a clear difference between Mon OB1 GMC East (12.4%) and Mon OB1 GMC West (3.3%). Our results show that the dense gas environment is closely linked to the nearby star-forming regions. On the other hand, star-forming activities have a great influence on the physical properties of the surrounding molecular gas (larger velocity dispersion, higher temperatures, more complex velocity structures, etc.). We also discuss the distribution/kinematics of molecular gas associated with nearby star-forming activities.

总结：<br /><br />本文讨论了三个属于紧缩对称天体（CSO）类别的射电喧哗活动星系核（AGN），它们具有检测到的窄Fe Kα线。文章使用Chandra X射线天文台和亚毫米阵列（SMA）的新观测数据，分析了J1407+2827、J1511+0518和J2022+6137的射电至γ射线光谱。新的Chandra数据排除了大于1.″5尺度的扩展X射线发射成分的存在。SMA数据揭示了射电叶子中电子分布的谱指数与NH之间的关联，这可以解释高度阻塞CSOs的γ射线安静特性。文章认为，紧缩射电叶子的逆康普顿辐射可能解释了所有这些源的固有X射线连续谱。此外，文章提出观察到的铁线可能是由周围冷尘的紧缩射电叶子连续谱的反射产生的。 <div>
X-ray continuum emission of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) may be reflected by circumnuclear dusty tori, producing prominent fluorescence iron lines at X-ray frequencies. Here, we discuss the broadband emission of three radio-loud AGNs belonging to the class of compact symmetric objects (CSOs), with detected narrow Fe Kα lines. CSOs have newly born radio jets, forming compact radio lobes with projected linear sizes of the order of a few to hundreds of parsecs. We model the radio-to-γ-ray spectra of compact lobes in J1407+2827, J1511+0518, and J2022+6137, which are among the nearest and the youngest CSOs known to date, and are characterized by an intrinsic X-ray absorbing column density of NH > 1023 cm−2. In addition to the archival data, we analyze the newly acquired Chandra X-ray Observatory and Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations, and also refine the γ-ray upper limits from Fermi Large Area Telescope monitoring. The new Chandra data exclude the presence of the extended X-ray emission components on scales larger than 1.″5. The SMA data unveil a correlation between the spectral index of the electron distribution in the lobes and NH, which can explain the γ-ray quietness of heavily obscured CSOs. Based on our modeling, we argue that the inverse-Compton emission of compact radio lobes may account for the intrinsic X-ray continuum in all these sources. Furthermore, we propose that the observed iron lines may be produced by a reflection of the lobes’ continuum from the surrounding cold dust.

总结:<br /><br />本研究利用第三代微型X射线太阳光谱仪DAXSS对2022年发生的六次太阳耀斑事件进行了分析。重点关注了耀斑的起始阶段，利用DAXSS光谱数据拟合宇宙等离子体发射代码模型，分析了耀斑起始阶段的等离子体温度、发射量和元素丰度因子的时间演化。研究结果表明，耀斑起始阶段的等离子体已经处于较高温度，伴随温度的上升、下降和再次上升。元素丰度因子在起始阶段低于耀斑前的值，在冲动阶段之前有所恢复。同时，利用大气成像组织的193埃通道图像分析耀斑起始阶段的日冕环结构的形成或变亮。DAXSS和AIA观测均表明，耀斑起始阶段展现出类似于冲动阶段的热日冕等离子体特性，暗示了起始阶段可能对某些耀斑具有预处理效应。 <div>
In this study, we present the analysis of six solar flare events that occurred in 2022, using new data from the third-generation Miniature X-Ray Solar Spectrometer, also known as the Dual-zone Aperture X-ray Solar Spectrometer (DAXSS). The primary focus of this study is on the flare’s onset phase, which is characterized by elevated soft X-ray emissions even before the flare’s impulsive phase. We analyze the temporal evolution of plasma temperature, emission measure, and elemental abundance factors during the flare onset phase by fitting the DAXSS spectra with the Astrophysical Plasma Emission Code model. The model fitting results indicate that the flaring plasma is already at a high temperature (10–15 MK) during the onset period. The temperature rises during the onset phase, followed by a decrease and subsequent increase during the impulsive phase. Elemental abundance factors show a trend of falling below preflare values during the onset phase, with some recovery before the impulsive phase. During the impulsive phase, the abundance factors decrease from elevated coronal values to about photospheric values. We also analyze images from the 193 Å channel of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), highlighting the formation or brightening of coronal loop structures during the onset phase. Two distinct onset loop configurations are observed, which are referred to as one-loop and two-loop onsets. Both DAXSS and AIA observations indicate that the flare onset phase exhibits hot coronal plasma properties similar to those of the impulsive phase, suggesting that the onset phase may act as a preconditioning effect for some flares.

<div> 关键词：差异旋转，角动量，涡动，Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke不稳定性，自洽饱和理论

总结：<br /><br />这篇文章提出了关于差异旋转恒星赤道处的涡动的自洽饱和理论。文章阐述了Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke不稳定性的驱动机制，并提出了一个统计闭合近似，以解释这种涡动的形成和发展过程。研究者推导了动量和热量的涡动传输速率，并提供了解析形式的公式。这些理论模型经过直接数值模拟的测试，结果显示良好的一致性。该理论还扩展到了热量和组分输运的研究，并在某些情况下取得了一致的结果。 <div>
Differentially rotating stars and planets transport angular momentum (AM) internally due to turbulence at rates that have long been a challenge to predict reliably. We develop a self-consistent saturation theory, using a statistical closure approximation, for hydrodynamic turbulence driven by the axisymmetric Goldreich–Schubert–Fricke instability at the stellar equator with radial differential rotation. This instability arises when fast thermal diffusion eliminates the stabilizing effects of buoyancy forces in a system where a stabilizing entropy gradient dominates over the destabilizing AM gradient. Our turbulence closure invokes a dominant three-wave coupling between pairs of linearly unstable eigenmodes and a near-zero frequency, viscously damped eigenmode that features latitudinal jets. We derive turbulent transport rates of momentum and heat and provide them in analytic forms. Such formulae, free of tunable model parameters, are tested against direct numerical simulations; the comparison shows good agreement. They improve upon prior quasi-linear or “parasitic saturation” models containing a free parameter. Given model correspondences, we also extend this theory to heat and compositional transport for axisymmetric thermohaline-instability-driven turbulence in certain regimes.

<div> 搜索外星智能，人工广播，单独搜索，混淆效应，集体约束<br />
总结：<br />
这篇文章讨论了搜索外星智能的方法，包括对其他星系中人工广播的限制。先前的方法使用个体主义方法，搜索信噪比高的单一广播，但这种方法限于非常明亮的广播，并且容易受到混淆的影响。因此作者提出了一种集体约束的新方法，通过评估混淆对个体主义搜索的影响，并比较了单独搜索和集体方法在银河系、M31和Virgo星系团中椭圆星系的广播。研究发现，集体约束对广播种群参数空间有很强的约束力，甚至对遥远星系的广播也有限制，并对最近的星系中的伽马射线、中微子和引力波广播也施加约束。 <div>
The search for extraterrestrial intelligence includes efforts to constrain populations of artificial broadcasts in other galaxies. Previous efforts use individualist methods, searching for single broadcasts with high signal-to-noise ratio. These would be detected as observables with extreme values. This approach is limited to very bright broadcasts and also is subject to confusion, where a large number of broadcasts blend together to form a noise continuum. The mean value of the total emission provides an additional collective bound: the luminosity of the transmitters is no higher than the galaxy’s observed luminosity. Using the framework developed in Paper I, I evaluate how confusion affects individualist searches. I then compare individualist and collective approaches for radio broadcasts from the Milky Way, M31, and three Virgo Cluster elliptical galaxies. For current observations, confusion blurs narrowband radio broadcasts together in the Virgo ellipticals when there is one broadcast per gigahertz per 1000 stars. The collective bound implies fewer than L-band broadcasts per star per gigahertz in the Milky Way wideband and is about 10 and 400 times stronger in M31 and M59, respectively. Applying the collective bound to the far-infrared–radio correlation yields constraints on radio broadcast populations in star-forming galaxies throughout the Universe. The collective bound allows us to rule out large regions of broadcast population parameter space even for distant galaxies. It also imposes constraints on gamma-ray, neutrino, and gravitational-wave broadcasts in the nearest galaxies.

<div> 关键词: 外星智慧生命，天体现象，概率形式主义，随机点过程，Drake方程<br />
总结:<br />
这篇文章讨论了假设类外智慧生命的假设性广播现象，提出了一种概率形式主义来描述它们的共同历史和性质分布。通过随机点过程在参数超空间中建模各种外星社会和其广播的分布，并且利用复合泊松随机变量来模拟可观测量。文章还重新推导了Drake方程，指出在没有扩张的情况下，探测到的广播数量可能与恒星质量呈二次关系，建议寻找大星系来进行搜索。 <div>
Artificial broadcasts from extraterrestrial intelligences are a hypothetical class of celestial phenomena. Unlike known astrophysical objects, the societies that generate them may be able to replicate on galactic scales through interstellar travel. Different galaxies could thus have drastically different populations, with variations in abundance of many orders of magnitude. I present a probabilistic formalism to treat this shared history, in which societies and their broadcasts are described by distributions over basic properties like lifespan and energy released. The framework contains a hierarchy of objects related by a tree structure. Discrete societies, the sources of broadcasts, are organized into potentially interstellar metasocieties. The population of each type of object is represented by a random point process in an abstract parameter hyperspace, a haystack. When a selection like an observation draws a sample, the point process is thinned. Given assumptions of interchangeability and independence, observables are modeled with compound Poisson random variables. I present an example of how selection bias can favor sampling longer-lived objects. I rederive the Drake equation for societies in the limit of no expansion. When interstellar replication is present, however, the mean number of detected broadcasts can depend quadratically on stellar mass, suggesting a search strategy favoring large galaxies.

<br />
在这篇论文中，研究人员进行了对J1044+0353周围的全息场光谱观测。他们发现该星系是一个低金属度快速增长的星系，产生了极端的[O iii]发射线。新的O32流量比图揭示了一个从星爆中心出现的密度边界的电离锥。氢电离辐射与星暴之前通过星系流出开凿的空腔相互作用，决定了全局莱曼连续辐射的逃逸路径。研究人员还发现，距离年轻的星暴中心几百秒差距的区域显示出超泡突破和吹出对[O iii]发射线的不同成分的贡献，分别为宽和非常宽的发射线翼。他们指出，宽组分的大量[O iii]发光来自光电电离的超泡壳，而不是通常假设的星系风。他们还观察到了空间分辨的He iiλ4686星云，显示出被年轻星团光电离的特征。这些星团的恒星风发射激发了He ii线的线翼。这种较宽的He ii成分显示出缓慢的恒星风，与J1044+0353的金属丰度下增加的恒星旋转（和有效逃逸速度降低）一致。至少在J1044+0353中，最近的星形成历史在产生莱曼连续辐射的全局路径上起着关键作用，这种非均向逃逸很可能被对莱曼连续辐射的直接观测所忽略。<br /><br />总结: 本论文通过全息场光谱对J1044+0353进行了研究，发现了低金属度星系的特点，揭示了氢电离辐射与星系流动相互作用的全局逃逸路径，以及He ii星云的特征和恒星风的影响。 <div>
We present integral field spectroscopy toward and around J1044+0353, a rapidly growing, low-metallicity galaxy that produces extreme [O iii] line emission. A new map of the O32 flux ratio reveals a density-bounded ionization cone emerging from the starburst. The interaction of the hydrogen-ionizing radiation, produced by the very young starburst, with a cavity previously carved out by a galactic outflow, whose apex lies well outside the starburst region, determines the pathway for global Lyman continuum (LyC) escape. In the region within a few hundred parsecs of the young starburst, we demonstrate that superbubble breakthrough and blowout contribute distinct components to the [O iii] line profile: broad and very broad emission line wings, respectively. We draw attention to the large [O iii] luminosity of the broad component and argue that this emission comes from photoionized, superbubble shells rather than a galactic wind as is often assumed. The spatially resolved He iiλ4686 nebula appears to be photoionized by young star clusters. Stellar wind emission from these stars is likely the source of line wings detected on the He ii line profile. This broader He ii component indicates slow stellar winds, consistent with an increase in stellar rotation (and a decrease in effective escape speed) at the metallicity of J1044+0353. At least in J1044+0353, the recent star formation history plays a critical role in generating a global pathway for LyC escape, and the anisotropic escape would likely be missed by direct observations of the LyC.

该研究使用Atacama Compact Array对IRAS 15398−3359进行了观测，发现了第三个与原恒星相关的流出并且检测到北西方向的新红移组分。这些发现表明，流出的发射方向可能随时间发生了显著变化。研究人员认为这可能是因为旋转轴和磁场不对齐或者密集核心湍流所致。与数值模拟结果的比较支持了这一假设。总之，这些发现为我们提供了关于IRAS 15398−3359的多个流出的重要信息，为我们理解类星体的形成和演化提供了有益的线索。<br /><br />总结: Class 0原恒星在CO J=2-1线观测中发现了多个流出，其中一些流出与之前观测的主要和次要流出不同向。研究人员认为这可能是流出发射方向随时间发生显著变化的结果。与数值模拟结果的比较支持了这一假设。 <div>
We present the results of our mosaic observations of a single Class 0 protostar IRAS 15398−3359 with the Atacama Compact Array in the CO J = 2–1 line. The new observations covering a square region reveal elongated redshifted and blueshifted components, which are located at distances of ∼30″–75″ on the northern and southern sides of the protostar, respectively, in addition to the previously observed primary and secondary outflows. These elongated components exhibit Hubble-law-like velocity structures, i.e., an increase of velocity with increasing distance from the protostar, suggesting that they comprise the third outflow associated with the protostar. Besides, a new redshifted component is detected at radii of ∼40″–75″ on the northwestern side of the protostar. This redshifted component also exhibits a Hubble-law-like velocity profile, which could be a counterpart of the secondary outflow mostly detected at blueshifted velocities in a previous study. The three outflows are all misaligned by ∼20°–90°, and the dynamical timescale of the primary outflow is shorter than those of the other outflows, approximately by an order of magnitude. These facts hint that the outflow launch direction has significantly changed with time. The outflow direction may change if the rotational axis and the magnetic field are misaligned or if the dense core is turbulent. We favor the second scenario as the origin of the multiple outflows in IRAS 15398−3359, based on a comparison between the observational results and numerical simulations.

总结:
JWST的出现促使对外行星大气进行更加完整的化学和光化学反应的研究需求。传统的手动构建反应网络的方法耗时且容易出错，且适用性有限。本文提出了一种自动化的方法，利用计算机辅助化学反应网络生成器，结合一维光化学动力学传输模型，自动选择反应速率，提高了模型的可靠性，并能够有效模拟不同的化学环境。作者使用WASP-39b和WASP-80b作为例子，证明了他们的方法的有效性，与最近的JWST数据取得了良好的一致性。这种自动化的化学网络生成方法为研究外行星大气提供了一个新颖、高效和精确的框架，是传统建模技术的重大进步。 <div>
With the advent of JWST and the spectroscopic characterization of exoplanet atmospheres in unprecedented detail, there is a demand for more complete pictures of chemical and photochemical reactions and their impacts on atmospheric composition. Traditionally, building reaction networks for (exo)planetary atmospheres involves manually tracking relevant species and reactions, a time-consuming and error-prone process. This approach’s applicability is also often limited to specific conditions, making it less versatile for different planetary types (i.e., photochemical networks for Jupiters may not be directly applicable to water-rich exoplanets). We introduce an automated approach using a computer-aided chemical reaction network generator, combined with a 1D photochemical kinetic-transport model, offering significant advantages. This approach automatically selects reaction rates through a rate-based iterative algorithm and multiple refinement steps, enhancing model reliability. Also, this approach allows for the efficient simulation of diverse chemical environments, from hydrogen to water, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen-dominated atmospheres. Using WASP-39b and WASP-80b as examples, we demonstrate our approach’s effectiveness, showing good agreement with recent JWST data. Our WASP-39b model aligns with prior studies and JWST observations, capturing photochemically produced sulfur dioxide. The WASP-80b model reveals an atmosphere influenced by deep-interior thermochemistry and vertical mixing, consistent with JWST NIRCam observations. Furthermore, our model identifies a novel initial step for the N2–NH3–HCN pathway that enhances the efficiency of the conversion in high-temperature/high-pressure environments. This automated chemical network generation offers a novel, efficient, and precise framework for studying exoplanetary atmospheres, marking a significant advancement over traditional modeling techniques.

本研究在Magellan+Megacam调查中对NGC 253进行了系统性搜索，发现了5个卫星，其中4个通过深度哈勃空间望远镜成像得到确认。在100kpc范围内，NGC 253的卫星绝对V波段等级MV < -7。在构建卫星亮度函数上，NGC 253的结果与其他局部星系进行了比较。研究还发现了卫星数和星形成比例与宿主恒星质量、环境和形态之间的关系，指向卫星形成的复杂模式。 <div>
We have conducted a systematic search around the Milky Way (MW) analog NGC 253 (D = 3.5 Mpc), as a part of the Panoramic Imaging Survey of Centaurus and Sculptor (PISCeS)—a Magellan+Megacam survey to identify dwarfs and other substructures in resolved stellar light around MW-mass galaxies outside of the Local Group. In total, NGC 253 has five satellites identified by PISCeS within 100 kpc with an absolute V-band magnitude of MV < −7. We have additionally obtained deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging of four reported candidates beyond the survey footprint: Do III, Do IV, and dw0036m2828 are confirmed to be satellites of NGC 253, while SculptorSR is found to be a background galaxy. We find no convincing evidence for the presence of a plane of satellites surrounding NGC 253. We construct its satellite luminosity function, which is complete down to MV ≲ −8 out to 100 kpc and MV ≲ −9 out to 300 kpc, and compare it to those calculated for other Local Volume galaxies. Exploring trends in satellite counts and star-forming fractions among satellite systems, we find relationships with host stellar mass, environment, and morphology, pointing to a complex picture of satellite formation, and a successful model has to reproduce all of these trends.

总结: 该研究利用IRIS仪器对太阳安静区域进行光谱观测，研究了波的传播。分析了不同大气层中形成的各种光谱线，如光球层、色球层和过渡区。通过对安静太阳不同位置的多普勒速度时间序列进行统计分析，得出了主导的振荡周期。结果显示，光球层主要以5分钟周期为主，而色球层主要与3分钟振荡周期相关。在过渡区，观察到多种振荡周期，其中以3、8和12分钟为主。通过推断不同温度下形成的不同大气层中光谱线对的多普勒速度时间序列之间的相位差，我们估计了截止频率。结果显示，在过渡区有3分钟周期与光球层振荡有显著相关性，表明这些振荡可能是从光球层向过渡区传播的。此外，分析了色球层振荡和光球层振荡之间的相位差，表明只有3分钟的振荡向上传播。根据统计分析结果，我们提出了太阳大气中存在磁声波，其中一些是从下向上传播，而另一些是向下传播。过渡区包含了在此处产生的长周期振荡和一些能够从下方到达的光球振动。<br /><br /> <div>
In this analysis, we use spectroscopic observations of the quiet Sun made by the IRIS instrument and investigate wave propagation. We analyze various spectral lines formed in different atmospheric layers, such as the photosphere, chromosphere, and transition region. We examine the Doppler velocity time series at various locations in the quiet Sun to determine the dominant oscillation periods. Our results executing statistical analysis resemble those of the classical physical scenario, indicating that the photosphere is mainly characterized by the dominant 5 minute period, while the chromosphere is primarily associated with the 3 minute oscillation period. In the transition region, we observe a variety of oscillation periods, with dominant periods of 3, 8, and 12 minutes. We estimate the cutoff frequency by deducing the phase difference between two Doppler velocity time series obtained from spectral line pairs in different atmospheric layers formed at different temperatures. This reveals a significant correlation between 3 minute periods in the transition region and photospheric oscillations, suggesting that these oscillations in the transition region might propagate from the photosphere. Additionally, we analyze the phase difference between chromospheric oscillations and photospheric oscillations, demonstrating that only the 3 minute oscillations propagate upward. Based on the statistical analyses, we suggest the presence of magnetoacoustic waves in the solar atmosphere, some of which are propagating from the lower solar atmosphere upward, while some others are propagating downward. The transition region carries both long-period oscillations generated in situ and some photospheric oscillations that are also able to reach there from below.

总结:
本文讨论了对能量大于1017 eV的中微子进行搜索的活跃追求。提到了银河系气体与超银河宇宙射线的相互作用确保了能量通量的保底水平为1018 eV。同时，作者还提出了宇宙射线产生的中微子通量的普遍估计，这一通量通常超过保底水平。然而，要想探测到能量大于1018 eV的中微子仍具有挑战性，除非质子加速到最高能量是在某些次要的宇宙射线源中发生，或者存在某些新的物理现象。 <div>
The search for neutrinos with energies greater than 1017 eV is being actively pursued. Although normalization of the dominant neutrino flux is highly uncertain, a floor level is guaranteed by the interactions of extragalactic cosmic rays with milky Way gas. We estimate that this floor level gives an energy flux of at 1018 eV, where uncertainties arise from the modeling of the gas distribution and the experimental determination of the mass composition of ultra–high-energy cosmic rays on Earth. Based on a minimal model of cosmic-ray production to explain the mass-discriminated energy spectra observed on Earth above 5 × 1018 eV, we also present generic estimates of the neutrino fluxes expected from extragalactic production that generally exceed the aforementioned guaranteed floor. The prospects for detecting neutrinos above 1018 eV remain challenging, however, unless proton acceleration to the highest energies is at play in a subdominant population of cosmic-ray sources or new physical phenomena are at work.

<div> 小行星、冰层、形成模型、观测、水世界
<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了小行星形成模型，发现从原行星盘的雪线外迁移的小行星可能含有富含水冰的核心，也就是所谓的水世界。观测结果提示存在这样的水世界，但无法确认行星核心的具体组成。研究者使用不同的形成模型和大气逸失模型来模拟与观测结果一致的行星系统，并发现大约10%的裸行星（即没有原始H/He大气的行星）可能在G型恒星周围富含水冰，而在M型恒星周围可能达到20%。然而，大多数水世界被预测位于10天以上的轨道周期上。这意味着通过径向速度和透射光谱学识别水世界可能在针对具有更长轨道周期的行星时更有成功的可能性。 <div>
Planet formation models suggest that the small exoplanets that migrate from beyond the snowline of the protoplanetary disk likely contain water-ice-rich cores (∼50% by mass), also known as water worlds. While the observed radius valley of the Kepler planets is well explained by the atmospheric dichotomy of the rocky planets, precise measurements of the mass and radius of the transiting planets hint at the existence of these water worlds. However, observations cannot confirm the core compositions of those planets, owing to the degeneracy between the density of a bare water-ice-rich planet and the bulk density of a rocky planet with a thin atmosphere. We combine different formation models from the Genesis library with atmospheric escape models, such as photoevaporation and impact stripping, to simulate planetary systems consistent with the observed radius valley. We then explore the possibility of water worlds being present in the currently observed sample by comparing them with simulated planets in the mass–radius–orbital period space. We find that the migration models suggest ≳10% and ≳20% of the bare planets, i.e., planets without primordial H/He atmospheres, to be water-ice-rich around G- and M-type host stars, respectively, consistent with the mass–radius distributions of the observed planets. However, most of the water worlds are predicted to be outside a period of 10 days. A unique identification of water worlds through radial velocity and transmission spectroscopy is likely to be more successful when targeting such planets with longer orbital periods.

Reports on the detection of carbonates in planetary nebulae (PNe) and protostars have suggested the existence of a mechanism that produces these compounds in stellar winds and outflows. A subsequent laboratory study has reported a possible mechanism by presenting the non-thermodynamic-equilibrium (TE), gas-phase condensation of amorphous silicate grains with amorphous calcium carbonate inclusions. The authors concluded that water vapor was necessary for the formation of the carbonates. We present a laboratory study with pulsed laser ablation of a MgSi target in O2 and CO2 gases and report, in the absence of water vapor, the non-TE, gas-phase condensation of amorphous carbonated magnesium silicate dust. It consists of amorphous silicate grains with the formula MgSiO3, which comprise carbonate groups homogeneously dispersed in their structure. The IR spectra of the grains show the characteristic bands of amorphous silicates and two bands at ∼6.3 and ∼7.0 μm, which we assign to the carbonate groups. The silicate bands are not significantly affected at an estimated Si:C ratio of 9:1–9:2. Such grains could form in winds and outflows of evolved stars and PNe if C atoms are present during silicate condensation. Additionally, we find that Lyα radiation dissociates the carbonate groups at the surface of the carbonated silicate grains and we estimate the corresponding photodissociation cross section of (0.04 ± 0.02) ×10−16 cm2. Therefore, photodissociation would limit the formation of carbonate groups on grains in winds and outflows of stars emitting vacuum ultraviolet photons, and the carbonates observed in protostars have not formed by gas-phase condensation.

研究表明，不同的对称能斜率值会影响静态和缓慢旋转中子星的性质。对于相同的角速度，对称能斜率会影响最大质量的增加，典型的1.4太阳质量中子星的半径和偏心率，以及2.01太阳质量中子星的这些参数。研究结果表明，不同的斜率值不仅影响绝对数值，还影响相对数值。事实上，不同的斜率值预测了偏心率的不同数值，而这并不取决于中子星半径的绝对值。因此，偏心率可以成为约束对称能斜率的有力工具。

<br /><br />总结: 对称能斜率的不同数值影响静态和缓慢旋转中子星的性质，包括最大质量增加、典型中子星的1.4太阳质量和2.01太阳质量的半径和偏心率。这些研究结果表明，偏心率可以成为约束对称能斜率的有力工具。 <div>
In 2023 December, the Fermi Large Area Telescope Catalog announced the discovery of 33 new millisecond pulsars. Motivated by that, in this work, I study how different values of the symmetry energy slope (L) affect the properties of static and slowly rotating neutron stars. For fixed values of angular velocity, I study how the slope influences the increase of the maximum mass, the radii of the canonical 1.4 M⊙, its eccentricity, as well the same quantities for the 2.01 M⊙ stars. I show that different slope values cause different variations not only in the absolute quantities but also in relative ones. Indeed, different slope values predict different values for the eccentricity, which does not depend on the absolute value of the neutron stars’ radii. Therefore, this quantity can be a powerful tool to constrain the symmetry energy slope.

总结: <br /><br />在天体物理中，涡动辐射混合层在气体云和炽热气流相互作用中扮演重要角色。研究发现，涡动速度与温度呈现明显的关联，随着时间的推移，涡动速度稳定在一定数值。同时，云与风的相对速度会导致涡动速度快速增长，之后逐渐下降并稳定在大约一半的最大数值。此外，涡动速度的大小与热相声传播时间与最小冷却时间的比值成正比。最后，研究还发现有关解决湍流的长度尺度存在着一些初步的证据。未能解决这一尺度可能导致云的大尺度形态特性发生变化。 <div>
Turbulent radiative mixing layers play an important role in many astrophysical contexts where cool (≲104 K) clouds interact with hot flows (e.g., galactic winds, high-velocity clouds, infalling satellites in halos and clusters). The fate of these clouds (as well as many of their observable properties) is dictated by the competition between turbulence and radiative cooling; however, turbulence in these multiphase flows remains poorly understood. We have investigated the emergent turbulence arising in the interaction between clouds and supersonic winds in hydrodynamic enzo-e simulations. In order to obtain robust results, we employed multiple metrics to characterize the turbulent velocity, vturb. We find four primary results when cooling is sufficient for cloud survival. First, vturb manifests clear temperature dependence. Initially, vturb roughly matches the scaling of sound speed on temperature. In gas hotter than the temperature where cooling peaks, this dependence weakens with time until vturb is constant. Second, the relative velocity between the cloud and wind initially drives rapid growth of vturb. As it drops (from entrainment), vturb starts to decay before it stabilizes at roughly half its maximum. At late times, cooling flows appear to support turbulence. Third, the magnitude of vturb scales with the ratio between the hot phase sound-crossing time and the minimum cooling time. Finally, we find tentative evidence for a length scale associated with resolving turbulence. Underresolving this scale may cause violent shattering and affect the cloud’s large-scale morphological properties.

<div> Tidal torques, spins, rotating systems, synchronization traps, inertial waves
<br /><br />总结: 本文讨论了潮汐力对于星体和行星自转的影响，特别是在偏心轨道系统中。在这种系统中，潮汐力驱动惯性振荡，导致了一系列稳定的“同步陷阱”，使得自转周期与轨道周期的比值偏离了传统的假同步预期。这一机制类似于潮汐共振锁定，但不需要推动振荡模式的非线性增长。同步陷阱可能会解释观测到的自转速率与假同步或同步预期不符的低质量恒星和热木星现象。 <div>
Tidal torques can alter the spins of tidally interacting stars and planets, usually over shorter timescales than the tidal damping of orbital separations or eccentricities. Simple tidal models predict that, in eccentric binary or planetary systems, rotation periods will evolve toward a “pseudosynchronous” ratio with the orbital period. However, this prediction does not account for “inertial” waves that are present in stars or gaseous planets with (i) convective envelopes and (ii) even very slow rotation. We demonstrate that tidal driving of inertial oscillations in eccentric systems generically produces a network of stable “synchronization traps” at ratios of orbital to rotation period that are simple to predict but can deviate significantly from pseudosynchronization. The mechanism underlying spin synchronization trapping is similar to tidal resonance locking, involving a balance between torques that is maintained automatically by the scaling of inertial mode frequencies with the rotation rate. In contrast with many resonance locking scenarios, however, the torque balance required for synchronization trapping need not drive mode amplitudes to nonlinearity. Synchronization traps may provide an explanation for low-mass stars and hot Jupiters with observed rotation rates that deviate from pseudosynchronous or synchronous expectations.

The repeated fast radio bursts FRB 121102A and FRB 190520B have been reported, along with a spatially coincident, compact, persistent radio emission. In this paper, we present a parameterized one-zone model, with the basic scenario that a relativistic magnetized wind from the pulsar sweeps up the surroundings, e.g., freely expanding supernova ejecta, giving rise to a power-law distribution of electrons between the forward shock and the termination shock. We show that via appropriate adjustment of the model parameters, we can obtain synchrotron radio emission properties from the one-zone model bright enough to account for the observation, simply and analytically fitting the observed spectra well. Through dynamical evolution of the model, we can also obtain time-varying relevant properties. This parameterized model does not depend on concrete physical models such as a central engine; instead, we can constraint the physical model via comparison between parameters and observations, indicating the information about the central engine and surroundings. We also discuss the synchrotron self-Compton emission in our scenario in the end but find no clue about the counterparts at other wave bands.

Supernova remnants (SNRs) exert a strong influence on the physics and chemistry of the nearby molecular clouds through shock waves and the cosmic rays (CRs) they accelerate. To investigate the SNR–cloud interaction in the prototype interacting SNR W28 (G6.4−0.1), we present new observations of the HCO+, , and HNC J = 1–0 lines, supplemented by archival data of CO isotopes, N2H+ and H13CO+. We compare the spatial distribution and spectral line profiles of different molecular species. Using the local thermodynamic equilibrium assumption, we obtain an abundance ratio of N(HCO+)/N(CO) ∼10−4 in the northeastern shocked cloud, which is higher by an order of magnitude than the values in unshocked clouds. This can be accounted for by the chemistry jointly induced by shock and CRs, with the physical parameters previously obtained from observations: preshock density nH ∼ 2 × 105 cm−3, CR ionization rate ζ = 2.5 × 10−15 s−1, and shock velocity Vs = 15–20 km s−1. Toward a point outside the northeastern boundary of W28 with a known high CR ionization rate, we estimate the abundance ratio N(HCO+)/N(N2H+) ≈ 0.6–3.3, which can be reproduced by a chemical simulation if a high density nH ∼ 2 × 105 cm−3 is adopted.

The interaction of β-particles with the weakly ionized plasma background is an important mechanism for powering the kilonova (KN) transient signal from neutron star mergers. For this purpose, we present an implementation of the approximate fast-particle collision kernel, described by Inokuti following the seminal formulation of Bethe, in a spectral solver of the Vlasov–Maxwell–Boltzmann equation. In particular, we expand the fast-particle plane-wave atomic excitation kernel into coefficients of the Hermite basis, and derive the relevant discrete spectral system. In this fast-particle limit, the approach permits the direct use of atomic data, including optical oscillator strengths, normally applied to photon–matter interaction. The resulting spectral matrix is implemented in the MASS-APP spectral solver framework, in a way that avoids full matrix storage per spatial zone. We numerically verify aspects of the matrix construction, and present a proof-of-principle 3D simulation of a 2D axisymmetric KN ejecta snapshot. Our preliminary numerical results indicate that a reasonable choice of Hermite basis parameters for β-particles in the KN is a bulk velocity parameter u = 0, a thermal velocity parameter α = 0.5c, and a 9 × 9 × 9 mode velocity basis set (Hermite orders of 0–8 in each dimension). For interior-ejecta sample zones, we estimate that the ratio of thermalization from large-angle (≳2.°5) bound excitation scattering to total thermalization is ∼0.002–0.003.

利用JWST/NIRCam测量了EIGER项目中5.9 < z < 7.1的六个类星体宿主星系和超大质量黑洞（SMBH）质量。我们获得了F115W、F200W和F356W波段的深度NIRCam成像，以及几个类星体的F356W棱镜光谱。我们利用明亮非饱和的恒星构建了点扩散函数（PSF）模型，并估计了这些PSF的误差。然后，通过将类星体图像拟合为点源加指数盘，测量或限制了类星体的荧光和形态。我们成功探测到了三个类星体，其宿主与类星的荧光比约为1%–5%。光谱能量分布拟合表明，这些类星体宿主星系的恒星质量为M* ≳ 1010M⊙。对于无法检测到宿主星系的类星体，我们估计了它们的恒星质量上限。我们使用棱镜光谱测量了Hβ线剖面和连续光度，然后估计了类星体的SMBH质量。我们的结果表明，在红移z ≳ 6时，宿主星系质量和SMBH质量之间存在着正相关关系。我们的样本中的类星体显示出较高的BH-to-stellar-mass比值，MBH/M* ∼ 0.15，比本地关系高出约2 dex。我们发现，选择效应只部分地导致了高红移类星体的高MBH/M*比率。这一结果暗示了MBH-M*关系可能存在红移演化。<br /><br />总结: 本研究利用JWST/NIRCam对EIGER项目中6个红移在5.9 < z < 7.1的类星体进行了观测。其中成功探测到3个类星体的宿主星系，这些宿主星系的恒星质量约为M* ≳ 1010M⊙。通过测量Hβ线剖面和连续光度，我们估计了类星体的SMBH质量。研究结果表明，红移z ≳ 6时，宿主星系质量和SMBH质量之间存在正相关关系。与本地关系相比，我们的样本显示出较高的BH-to-stellar-mass比值，MBH/M* ∼ 0.15，这可能暗示了MBH-M*关系存在红移演化。 <div>
We report JWST/NIRCam measurements of quasar host galaxy emissions and supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses for six quasars at 5.9 < z < 7.1 in the Emission-line galaxies and Intergalactic Gas in the Epoch of Reionization (EIGER) project. We obtain deep NIRCam imaging in the F115W, F200W, and F356W bands, as well as F356W grism spectroscopy of the quasars. We use bright unsaturated stars to construct models of the point-spread functions (PSFs) and estimate the errors of these PSFs. We then measure or constrain the fluxes and morphology of the quasar host galaxies by fitting the quasar images as a point source plus an exponential disk. We successfully detect the host galaxies of three quasars, which have host-to-quasar-flux ratios of ∼1%–5%. Spectral energy distribution fitting suggests that these quasar host galaxies have stellar masses of M* ≳ 1010M⊙. For quasars with host galaxy nondetections, we estimate the upper limits of their stellar masses. We use the grism spectra to measure the Hβ line profile and the continuum luminosity, then estimate the SMBH masses for the quasars. Our results indicate that the positive relation between SMBH masses and host galaxy stellar masses already exists at redshift z ≳ 6. The quasars in our sample show a high BH-to-stellar-mass ratio of MBH/M* ∼ 0.15, which is about ∼2 dex higher than local relations. We find that selection effects only contribute partially to the high MBH/M* ratios of high-redshift quasars. This result hints at a possible redshift evolution of the MBH–M* relation.

<div> James Webb Space Telescope, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei, black hole masses, stellar tidal disruption events, high-redshift TDEs
<br /><br />总结:
研究使用James Webb Space Telescope发现了高红移下低光度活跃星系核的存在，并对这些天体的核心黑洞质量进行了估算。这一发现拓展了庞大黑洞种群的初始质量分布的研究范围。论文着重从紫外至光学波段的恒星潮撕裂事件入手，探讨了这一工具在研究质量小于10^4-6M⊙的黑洞种群方面的应用。研究估算了在高红移z = 4–11范围内与JWST检测的AGN宿主星系属性相关的TDE率，并认为JWST和Roman Space Telescope可以探测和识别高达z ≃ 4–7的TDE。预测了在高红移z > 4范围内JWST和Roman Space Telescope在1年内可以观测和发现的TDE数量。进一步讨论了与Vera C. Rubin Observatory联合观测的调查策略，以提高高红移TDE的检测数量。高红移TDE的研究将为我们提供探索早期黑洞种群质量分布的独特机会。 <div>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently uncovered the presence of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at z = 4–11. Spectroscopic observations have provided estimates of the nuclear black hole (BH) masses for these sources, extending the low-mass boundary down to M• ∼ 106–7M⊙. Despite this breakthrough, the observed lowest mass of BHs is still ≳1–2 orders of magnitude heavier than the predicted mass range of their seed population, thereby leaving the initial mass distribution of massive BHs poorly constrained. In this paper, we focus on UV-to-optical (in the rest frame) flares of stellar tidal disruption events (TDEs) embedded in low-luminosity AGNs as a tool for exploring low-mass BH populations with ≲104–6M⊙. We provide an estimate of the TDE rate over z = 4–11, associated with the properties of JWST-detected AGN host galaxies, and we find that deep and wide survey programs with JWST and the Roman Space Telescope (RST) can detect and identify TDEs up to z ≃ 4–7. The predicted detection numbers of TDEs at z > 4 in 1 yr are for the JADES-Medium (and COSMOS-Web) survey with JWST and for the deep (and wide) tiers of the High Latitude Time Domain Survey with RST. We further discuss survey strategies for hunting for transient high-redshift TDEs in wide-field surveys with RST, as well as a joint observation campaign with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory for enhancing the detection number. The high-redshift TDE search will give us a unique opportunity to probe the mass distribution of early BH populations.

<div> 关键词: TRGB, 距离测量, 近红外, 星系, HST<br />
总结: 
红巨星分支尖端(TRGB)方法在I波段是测量近距离星系距离最有效和精确的技术之一。同时，近红外的TRGB比I波段亮1-2个数量级，有扩大测量星系距离范围的潜力。通过对8个近邻星系的12个区域进行HST成像，我们建立了WFC3/IR F110W和F160W滤光片下TRGB的基准和颜色校正。这项新的校准精度大约为F814W TRGB距离的1%。我们通过验证发现，使用近红外TRGB校准后的距离模数与使用F814W TRGB确定的距离模数一致。这项工作将直接为我们在JWST NIRCam和NIRISS光度滤波器中校准TRGB提供重要信息。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
The tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) based distance method in the I band is one of the most efficient and precise techniques for measuring distances to nearby galaxies (D ≲ 15 Mpc). The TRGB in the near-infrared (NIR) is 1–2 mag brighter relative to the I band, and has the potential to expand the range over which distance measurements to nearby galaxies are feasible. Using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of 12 fields in eight nearby galaxies, we determine color-based corrections and zero-points of the TRGB in the Wide Field Camera 3 IR (WFC3/IR) F110W and F160W filters. First, we measure TRGB distances in the I band equivalent Advanced Camera System (ACS) F814W filter from resolved stellar populations with the HST. The TRGB in the ACS F814W filter is used for our distance anchor and to place the WFC3/IR magnitudes on an absolute scale. We then determine the color dependence (a proxy for metallicity/age) and zero-point of the NIR TRGB from photometry of WFC3/IR fields that overlap with the ACS fields. The new calibration is accurate to ∼1% in distance relative to the F814W TRGB. Validating the accuracy of the calibrations, we find that the distance modulus for each field using the NIR TRGB calibration agrees with the distance modulus of the same field as determined from the F814W TRGB. This is a JWST preparatory program, and the work done here will directly inform our approach to calibrating the TRGB in JWST NIRCam and NIRISS photometric filters.

<div> VMP stars, early accreted galaxies, chemodynamical analysis, abundance patterns, kinematics
<br /><br />总结:
本研究对来自LAMOST和Subaru的352颗VMP星进行了化学动力学分析。利用友好聚类算法，将5778颗VMP星分为131个动力学标记组，其中89个与银河中已知的次结构相关。研究发现VMPD的锌丰度较低，可能是小型恒星系统的遗迹；Sequoia显示出适度高的r-过程丰度；Helmi流域的碳和轻中子俘获元素缺陷；VMPD和Helmi流域中碳富集金属贫困星的比例较低；GSE中的一个子群显示出很高的r-过程富集星的比例。此外，对丰度比和动力学的大尺度相关性研究并未发现明显的相关性。 <div>
Very metal-poor (VMP) stars record the signatures of early accreted galaxies, making them essential tools for unraveling the early stages of Galaxy formation. Understanding the origin of VMP stars requires comprehensive studies of their chemical compositions and kinematics, which are currently lacking. Hence, we conduct a chemodynamical analysis of 352 VMP stars selected from one of the largest uniform high-resolution VMP star samples, jointly obtained from LAMOST and Subaru. We apply a friends-of-friends clustering algorithm to the master catalog of this high-resolution sample, which consists of 5778 VMP stars. It results in 131 dynamically tagged groups with 89 associated with known substructures in the Milky Way, including Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), Thamnos, Helmi streams, Sequoia, Wukong, Pontus, and the very metal-poor disk (VMPD). Our findings are: (i) the VMPD shows lower Zn abundances than the rest, which indicates that it could be a relic of small stellar systems; (ii) Sequoia shows moderately high r-process abundances; (iii) Helmi streams show deficiencies in carbon and light neutron-capture elements; (iv) the fraction of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars with no enhancement in heavy elements (CEMP-no stars) seems low in the VMPD and the Helmi streams; and (v) a subgroup in GSE exhibits a very high fraction of r-process enhanced stars, with four out of five showing [Eu/Fe]> +1.0. The abundance patterns of other elements in VMP substructures largely match the whole VMP sample. We also study large-scale correlations between abundance ratios and kinematics without classifying stars into substructures, but it does not yield significant correlations once the overall chemical evolution is considered for most elements.

<div> 磁化等离子体柱、延伸磁场结构、太阳等离子体不稳定生长过程中产生的电流环等现象，在太阳的日冕中观测到，并有望存在于高度磁化的中子星磁层和吸积盘日冕中。本文通过线性分析和时间依赖的自由力电动力学模拟，研究了线系束缚力自由磁通管的稳定性和扭曲能量在不稳定过程中的耗散。对于不同的扭曲和系统尺寸，我们发现磁场线与列长度之比的倒数q，当q ≲ 1时，会产生m = 1的扭曲模式和高效的磁能耗散，而对于q > 1，会产生高阶扭曲模式，但耗散效果较低。磁通管场线的特征间距决定了扭曲不稳定的增长率和最小波长。通过类比理想化的磁星磁层对边界剪切率的变化，我们讨论了与磁场线特征间距相关的增长率对磁星条件下的磁层耗散的预期影响。

<br /><br />总结:
关键词: 等离子体柱, 磁场结构, 扭曲能量, 稳定性, 磁层耗散
1. 介绍了等离子体柱和磁场结构在天体物理耗散模型中的重要性。
2. 使用线性分析和时间依赖的力电动力学模拟研究了磁通管的稳定性和扭曲能量耗散。
3. 发现q值小于1时会产生m=1的扭曲模式和高效的磁能耗散。

5. 探讨了这些发现对磁星条件下磁层耗散的潜在影响。 <div>
Magnetized plasma columns and extended magnetic structures with both footpoints anchored to a surface layer are an important building block of astrophysical dissipation models. Current loops shining in X-rays during the growth of plasma instabilities are observed in the corona of the Sun and are expected to exist in highly magnetized neutron star magnetospheres and accretion disk coronae. For varying twist and system sizes, we investigate the stability of line-tied force-free flux tubes and the dissipation of twist energy during instabilities using linear analysis and time-dependent force-free electrodynamics simulations. Kink modes (m = 1) and efficient magnetic energy dissipation develop for plasma safety factors q ≲ 1, where q is the inverse of the number of magnetic field line windings per column length. Higher-order fluting modes (m > 1) can distort equilibrium flux tubes for q > 1 but induce significantly less dissipation. In our analysis, the characteristic pitch of flux-tube field lines determines the growth rate ( ) and minimum wavelength of the kink instability ( ). We use these scalings to determine a minimum flux tube length for the growth of the kink instability for any given . By drawing analogies to idealized magnetar magnetospheres with varying regimes of boundary shearing rates, we discuss the expected impact of the pitch-dependent growth rates for magnetospheric dissipation in magnetar conditions.

<div> 星际介质，模拟，金属丰度，星际物质结构，分子氢丰度
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章使用了一套包括辐射传递、分子氢的非平衡模型和实际星际物质形成及反馈的流体力学模拟，研究了星系盘内星际介质的结构和H2丰度与局部星际物质性质的关系。研究发现，金属丰度对星际物质的结构和星形成速率有很大影响，随着金属丰度的降低，密度分布变得越来越平滑。此外，H I–H2转变密度随金属丰度降低而向更高密度的方向漂移，而在Z≲ 0.2 Z⊙时，星际介质中达到的分子比例急剧下降。研究提出了关于气态金属丰度、紫外辐射场和气体密度的精确拟合公式，并且在模拟星系的小区域内，该公式对整个金属丰度和尺度范围内的分子气体质量的预测误差都在1.5倍以内。此外，该拟合公式在低金属丰度范围内比以往的模型更为准确，可用于模拟低分辨率和半解析星系形成模型中的分子气体。 <div>
We use a suite of hydrodynamics simulations of the interstellar medium (ISM) within a galactic disk, which includes radiative transfer, a nonequilibrium model of molecular hydrogen, and a realistic model for star formation and feedback, to study the structure of the ISM and H2 abundance as a function of local ISM properties. We show that the star formation rate and structure of the ISM are sensitive to the metallicity of the gas with a progressively smoother density distribution with decreasing metallicity. In addition to the well-known trend of the H I–H2 transition shifting to higher densities with decreasing metallicity, the maximum achieved molecular fraction in the ISM drops drastically at Z ≲ 0.2 Z⊙ as the formation time of H2 becomes much longer than a typical lifetime of dense regions of the ISM. We present accurate fitting formulae for both volumetric and projected measured on different scales as a function of gas metallicity, UV radiation field, and gas density. We show that when the formulae are applied to the patches in the simulated galaxy, the overall molecular gas mass is reproduced to better than a factor of ≲1.5 across the entire range of metallicities and scales. We also show that the presented fit is considerably more accurate than any of the previous models and fitting formulae in the low-metallicity regime. The fit can thus be used for modeling molecular gas in low-resolution simulations and semi-analytic models of galaxy formation in the dwarf and high-redshift regimes.

<div> 关键词: 高质量恒星形成, 破碎, 物质团, 高质量星团, 分形

总结:
高质量恒星形成的早期阶段破碎对于理解高质量星团的形成至关重要。通过Atacama大型毫米/亚毫米阵列70μm暗高质量物质团（ASHES）调查，我们对39个高质量星形成团中的破碎进行了调查。通过对连续发射的核心进行估计，发现了839个核心的平均间距在0.08至0.32 pc之间。我们发现观察到的核心间距和质量与热力学Jeans长度和质量相符。我们还发现了7m阵列连续发射所揭示的次团结构。将物质团和次团密度的Jeans参数与引力束缚核心的间距和质量进行比较，暗示了物质团的破碎，表明了在阶层破碎的过程中次团和核心的同时形成。每个物质团中核心的数量与物质团表面密度呈正相关，与热力学Jeans破碎所预期的数量也一致。我们还发现，原恒星核心的分数越高，核心质量的动态范围就越大，表明了随着物质团演化，核心的质量在增长。ASHES样本呈现出不同的破裂模式：排列，分散，聚类和次聚类。最后，通过参数，可以帮助区分核心分布的中心浓缩和次聚类，我们发现在高质量恒星形成的早期演化阶段，核心倾向于遵循次聚类分布。 <div>
Fragmentation during the early stages of high-mass star formation is crucial for understanding the formation of high-mass clusters. We investigated fragmentation within 39 high-mass star-forming clumps as part of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Survey of 70 μm Dark High-mass Clumps in Early Stages (ASHES) survey. Considering projection effects, we have estimated core separations for 839 cores identified from the continuum emission and found mean values between 0.08 and 0.32 pc within each clump. We find compatibility of the observed core separations and masses with the thermal Jeans length and mass, respectively. We also present subclump structures revealed by the 7 m array continuum emission. Comparison of the Jeans parameters using clump and subclump densities with the separation and masses of gravitationally bound cores suggests that they can be explained by clump fragmentation, implying the simultaneous formation of subclumps and cores within rather than a step-by-step hierarchical fragmentation. The number of cores in each clump positively correlates with the clump surface density and the number expected from the thermal Jeans fragmentation. We also find that the higher the fraction of protostellar cores, the larger the dynamic range of the core mass, implying that the cores are growing in mass as the clump evolves. The ASHES sample exhibits various fragmentation patterns: aligned, scattered, clustered, and subclustered. Using the -parameter, which can help distinguish between centrally condensed and subclustered spatial core distributions, we finally find that in the early evolutionary stages of high-mass star formation, cores tend to follow a subclustered distribution.

总结:<br />
这篇文章研究了10个矮星系的离子化谱，发现其中6个矮星系的离子化谱与中等质量黑洞的辐射模型相似，推测这些矮星系可能含有质量在10^3-10^5M⊙范围内的中间质量黑洞。研究结果对于了解星系中黑洞的性质和形成起到了重要作用。 <div>
We present ionizing spectra estimated at 13.6–100 eV for 10 dwarf galaxies with strong high-ionization lines of He ii λ4686 and [Ne v] λ3426 ([Ne iv] λ2424) at z = 0 (z = 8) that are identified in our Keck/LRIS spectroscopy and the literature (the JWST Early Release Observations program). With the flux ratios of these high-ionization lines and >10 low-ionization lines of hydrogen, helium, oxygen, neon, and sulfur, we determine ionizing spectra consisting of stellar and nonthermal power-law radiation by photoionization modeling with free parameters of nebular properties, including metallicity and ionization parameter, canceling out abundance ratio differences. We find that all of the observed flux ratios are well reproduced by the photoionization models with the power-law index αEUV of αEUV ∼ (–1) − 0 and the luminosity LEUV of LEUV ∼ 1040–1042 erg s−1 at ∼55–100 eV for six galaxies, while four galaxies include large systematics in αEUV caused by stellar radiation contamination. We then compare αEUV and LEUV of these six galaxies with those predicted by the black hole (BH) accretion disk models and find that αEUV and LEUV are similar to those of the intermediate-mass BHs (IMBHs) in BH accretion disk models, albeit with possibilities of the other scenarios. Confirming these results with a known IMBH having a mass MBH of MBH = 105.75M⊙, we find that four local galaxies and one z = 7.665 galaxy have ionizing spectra consistent with those of IMBHs with MBH ∼ 103–105M⊙.

<div> 星团，质量函数，Gaia数据，双星系统，初始质量函数

在这项研究中，通过使用Gaia数据第三版数据，采用StarGo机器学习算法确定成员资格，对93个星团的现代质量函数（PDMF）进行了分析。对未解析双星系统对质量估计的影响进行了严格评估，并采用三种质量比率剖面进行校正。PDMF通过稳健的最大似然方法来表征幂律指数α，避免了与数据分箱相关的偏差。我们观察到，对于小于200百万年的星团，α的值在Gaia的完整质量下限（平均为0.3 M⊙）和2 M⊙之间的恒定，而对于更老的星团，特别是考虑半质量半径内的恒星时，α则逐渐减小。这些星团的PDMF与通过失去低质星形成的Kroupa初始质量函数一致。星团的形态与α呈相关性，α值表现出从纤维状到潮尾星团的递减趋势，与星团年龄递增的顺序相一致。α对总星团质量的依赖性较弱，尤其在半质量半径外，高质量星团的α值略有增加。我们没有观察到α与星团的平均金属丰度之间的相关性。年轻星团的金属丰度比其较老的对应物低，这表明较老的星团可能已从内盘迁移到了太阳附近。与包含黑洞群体的数值模型的比较表明，需要观测遥远、年龄较大的大质量敞开星团，以确定它们是否含有黑洞。<br /><br />总结: 该研究分析了93个星团的现代质量函数，发现了PDMF的指数α与星团年龄和形态之间的关联性，以及与金属丰度的关系。研究结果还表明，有必要观测远处、年龄较大的大质量敞开星团，以确定它们是否包含黑洞。 <div>
This work analyzes the present-day mass function (PDMF) of 93 star clusters utilizing Gaia Data Release 3 data, with membership determined by the StarGo machine-learning algorithm. The impact of unresolved binary systems on mass estimation is rigorously assessed, adopting three mass ratio profiles for correction. The PDMF is characterized by the power-law index, α, derived through a robust maximum likelihood method that avoids biases associated with data binning. The value of α for stars between the completeness limited mass of Gaia (with a mean 0.3 M⊙ for our cluster samples) and 2 M⊙ exhibits stability for clusters younger than 200 Myr, decreasing for older clusters, particularly when considering stars within the half-mass radius. The PDMF of these star clusters is consistent with a dynamically evolved Kroupa initial mass function via the loss of low-mass stars. Cluster morphology shows a correlation with α, as α values exhibit a decreasing trend from filamentary to tidal-tail clusters, mirroring the sequence of increasing cluster age. The dependence of α on the total cluster mass is weak, with a subtle increase for higher-mass clusters, especially outside the half-mass radius. We do not observe a correlation between α and the mean metallicity of the clusters. Younger clusters have lower metallicity compared to their older counterparts, which indicates that the older clusters might have migrated to the solar neighborhood from the inner disk. A comparison with numerical models incorporating a black hole population suggests the need for observations of distant, older, massive open clusters to determine whether or not they contain black holes.

这篇研究调查了118个早型星系的球状星团（GC）系统的大小和结构。研究发现，无论在整个星系质量范围内（108.3M⊙ < M* < 1011.6M⊙），GC系统都比宿主星系的有效半径（Re,gc）大2-4倍。此外，Re,gc和星系恒星质量之间的关系在恒星质量为Mp ≃ 1010.8时出现了“拐点”，类似于星系Re-恒星质量关系。研究还对传统的蓝色和红色GC颜色亚群进行了新的描述，发现红色Δgi的GC群体甚至在矮星系中也有两倍于恒星的扩展性。此外，还发现了Re,gc与GC总数之间存在紧密的关联，并发现环境对Re,gc的影响，密度较低的环境下GC系统更加扩展。总之，这项研究提供了对于GC系统大小和结构与宿主星系性质和环境关系的关键见解。 
<br /><br />总结: 这项研究调查了早型星系球状星团系统的大小和结构，发现它们比宿主星系更加扩展，且与宿主星系的恒星质量和颜色存在相关性。红色的GC群体在大小上的扩展性是蓝色群体的两倍，GC系统的大小与GC总数之间存在紧密关联，且环境密度对其大小也有影响。 <div>
We study the size and structure of globular cluster (GC) systems of 118 early-type galaxies from the NGVS, MATLAS, and ACSVCS surveys. Fitting Sérsic profiles, we investigate the relationship between effective radii of GC systems (Re,gc) and galaxy properties. GC systems are 2–4 times more extended than host galaxies across the entire stellar mass range of our sample (108.3M⊙ < M* < 1011.6M⊙). The relationship between Re,gc and galaxy stellar mass exhibits a characteristic “knee” at a stellar mass of Mp ≃ 1010.8, similar to the galaxy Re–stellar mass relationship. We present a new characterization of the traditional blue and red GC color subpopulations, describing them with respect to host galaxy color (Δgi): GCs with similar colors to their hosts have a “red” Δgi, and those significantly bluer GCs have a “blue” Δgi. The GC populations with red Δgi, even in dwarf galaxies, are twice as extended as the stars, suggesting that formation or survival mechanisms favor the outer regions. We find a tight correlation between Re,gc and the total number of GCs, with intrinsic scatter ≲0.1 dex spanning two and three orders of magnitude in size and number, respectively. This holds for both red and blue subpopulations, albeit with different slopes. Assuming that NGC,Total correlates with M200, we find that the red GC systems have effective radii of roughly 1%–5% R200, while the blue GC systems in massive galaxies can have sizes as large as ∼10% R200. Environmental dependence on Re,gc is also found, with lower-density environments exhibiting more extended GC systems at fixed mass.

<div> 关键词: 过渡盘，PDS 70系统，内部盘，尘埃和气体耗尽，行星形成

总结:
过渡盘是行星形成后期的一个阶段，其中内部区域缺乏尘埃和气体。研究PDS 70系统时发现，该系统内有两颗巨行星围绕着内部盘空洞轨道运行，至少有一颗正在吸积物质。然而，最让人关注的是系统内部盘区域，因为这是系统过剩红外辐射的主要来源。研究人员通过光学和红外光度学以及光谱学分析表明，内部盘的动态变化时间跨度为数天到数年，尘埃对恒星进行的光学遮挡使其变暗，而3–5 μm的辐射由于盘结构的变化而发生变化。同时，内部区域的红外辐射在约1年的时间内(几乎)消失。研究人员利用一个温暖的(温度≲600 K)扁平盘和一个更热的(1200 K)尘域建立了该系统的光谱能量分布模型，并考虑了其时间变化。内部盘的高尘埃对气体比率意味着此处可能是一个由内区域的碰撞和行星小天体的蒸发产生的尘埃和挥发物质富集的“妖兽”。 <div>
Transition disks, with inner regions depleted in dust and gas, could represent later stages of protoplanetary disk evolution when newly formed planets are emerging. The PDS 70 system has attracted particular interest because of the presence of two giant planets in orbits at tens of astronomical units within the inner disk cavity, at least one of which is itself accreting. However, the region around PDS 70 most relevant to understanding the planet populations revealed by exoplanet surveys of middle-aged stars is the inner disk, which is the dominant source of the system’s excess infrared emission but only marginally resolved by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. Here we present and analyze time-series optical and infrared photometry and spectroscopy that reveal the inner disk to be dynamic on timescales of days to years, with occultation by submicron dust dimming the star at optical wavelengths, and 3–5 μm emission varying due to changes in disk structure. Remarkably, the infrared emission from the innermost region (nearly) disappears for ∼1 yr. We model the spectral energy distribution of the system and its time variation with a flattened warm (T ≲ 600 K) disk and a hotter (1200 K) dust that could represent an inner rim or wall. The high dust-to-gas ratio of the inner disk, relative to material accreting from the outer disk, means that the former could be a chimera consisting of depleted disk gas that is subsequently enriched with dust and volatiles produced by collisions and evaporation of planetesimals in the inner zone.

总结:<br />
研究使用JWST光谱仪对LIRG VV 114的分子振动带进行了详细分析，观测结果表明，在星暴区域探测到了CO的高度激发，而在星系核区域只探测到了较低温度的分子气体。研究认为这表明CO和H2O的平衡条件是通过中红外线激发和振动线来实现的，这为对星系核和星暴区域的电离和辐射传输过程提供了新的理解。 <div>
The enormous increase in mid-IR sensitivity and spatial and spectral resolution provided by the JWST spectrographs enables, for the first time, detailed extragalactic studies of molecular vibrational bands. This opens an entirely new window for the study of the molecular interstellar medium in luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs). We present a detailed analysis of rovibrational bands of gas-phase CO, H2O, C2H2, and HCN toward the heavily obscured eastern nucleus of the LIRG VV 114, as observed by NIRSpec and the medium resolution spectrograph on the Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI MRS). Spectra extracted from apertures of 130 pc in radius show a clear dichotomy between the obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN) and two intense starburst regions. We detect the 2.3 μm CO bandheads, characteristic of cool stellar atmospheres, in the star-forming regions, but not toward the AGN. Surprisingly, at 4.7 μm, we find highly excited CO (Tex ≈ 700–800 K out to at least rotational level J = 27) toward the star-forming regions, but only cooler gas (Tex ≈ 200 K) toward the AGN. We conclude that only mid-infrared pumping through the rovibrational lines can account for the equilibrium conditions found for CO and H2O in the deeply embedded starbursts. Here, the CO bands probe regions with an intense local radiation field inside dusty young massive star clusters or near the most massive young stars. The lack of high-excitation molecular gas toward the AGN is attributed to geometric dilution of the intense radiation from the bright point source. An overview of the relevant excitation and radiative transfer physics is provided in an appendix.

<title>Pinwheel Outflow Induced by Stellar Mass Loss in a Coplanar Triple System</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We develop a physical framework for interpreting complex circumstellar patterns whorled around asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars by investigating stable, coplanar triple systems using hydrodynamic and particle simulations. The introduction of a close tertiary body causes an additional periodic variation in the orbital velocity and trajectory of the AGB star. As a result, the circumstellar outflow builds a fine non-Archimedean spiral pattern superimposed upon the Archimedean spiral produced by the outer binary alone. This fine spiral can be approximated by off-centered circular rings that become tangent to each other at the location of the Archimedean spiral. The superimposed fine pattern fades out relatively quickly as a function of distance from the center of the system, in contrast to the dominant Archimedean spiral pattern, which presents a much slower fractional density decrease with radius. The different rates of radial decrease of the density contrast in the two superimposed patterns, coupled with their different time and spatial scales, lead to an apparent, but illusory radial change in the observed pattern interval, as has been reported, for example, in CW Leo. The function describing the detailed radial dependence of the expansion velocity is different in the two patterns, which may be used to distinguish them. The shape of the circumstellar whorled pattern is further explored as a function of the orbital eccentricity and the inner companion’s mass. Although this study is confined to stable, coplanar triple systems, the results are likely applicable to moderately noncoplanar systems and open interesting avenues for studying noncoplanar systems.

Solar energetic particle (SEP) events are one of the most crucial aspects of space weather that require continuous monitoring and forecasting. Their prediction depends on various factors, including source eruptions. In the present work, we use the Geostationary Solar Energetic Particle data set covering solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. We develop a framework using time-series-based machine-learning (ML) models with the aim of developing robust short-term forecasts by classifying SEP events. For this purpose, we introduce an ensemble learning approach that merges the results from univariate time series of three proton channels (E ≥10, 50, and 100 MeV) and the long-band X-ray flux (1–8 Å) channel from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite missions and analyze their performance. We consider three models, namely, time series forest, supervised time series forest (STSF), and Bag-of-Symbolic Fourier Approximation Symbols. Our study also focuses on understanding and developing confidence in the predictive capabilities of our models. Therefore, we utilize multiple evaluation techniques and metrics. Based on that, we find STSF to perform well in all scenarios. The summary of metrics for the STSF model is as follows: the area under the ROC curve = 0.981, F1-score = 0.960, true skill statistics = 0.919, Heidke skill score = 0.920, Gilbert skill score = 0.852, and Matthew’s correlation coefficient = 0.920. The Brier score loss of the STSF model is 0.077. This work lays the foundation for building near-real-time short-term SEP event predictions using robust ML methods.

A leading candidate for the heating source of chondrules and igneous rims is shock waves. This mechanism generates high relative velocities between chondrules and dust particles. We have investigated the possibility of the chondrule destruction in collisions with dust particles behind a shock wave using a semianalytical treatment. We find that the chondrules are destroyed during melting in collisions. We derive the conditions for the destruction of chondrules and show that the typical size of the observed chondrules satisfies the condition. We suggest that the chondrule formation and rim accretion are different events if they are heated by shock waves.

We present a systematic analysis of the X-ray emission of a sample of 17 optically selected, X-ray-detected tidal disruption events (TDEs) discovered between 2014 and 2021. The X-ray light curves show a diverse range of temporal behaviors, with most sources not following the expected power-law decline. The X-ray spectra are mostly extremely soft and consistent with thermal emission from the innermost region of an accretion disk, which cools as the accretion rate decreases. Three sources show formation of a hard X-ray corona at late times. The spectral energy distribution shape, probed by the ratio (LBB/LX) between the UV/optical and X-ray, shows a wide range of LBB/LX ∈ (0.5, 3000) at early times and converges to disklike values of LBB/LX ∈ (0.5, 10) at late times. We estimate the fraction of optically discovered TDEs with LX ≥ 1042 erg s−1 to be at least 40% and show that X-ray loudness is independent of black hole mass. We argue that distinct disk formation timescales are unlikely to be able to explain the diverse range of X-ray evolution. We combine our sample with X-ray-discovered ones to construct an X-ray luminosity function, best fit by a broken power law, with a break at LX ≈ 1044 erg s−1. We show that there is no dichotomy between optically and X-ray-selected TDEs; instead, there is a continuum of early-time LBB/LX, at least as wide as LBB/LX ∈ (0.1, 3000), with optical/X-ray surveys selecting preferentially, but not exclusively, from the higher/lower end of the distribution. Our findings are consistent with unification models for the overall TDE population.

这篇文章研究了通过Swift UV测光和光谱子类型的早期光变曲线的测量来收集42个Ia型超新星样本。研究发现，类2002es和类2003fg的Ia型超新星在前峰UV颜色演变上与普通的Ia型超新星和其他光谱亚型有所不同。具体来说，相对于B波段峰值，类2002es和类2003fg的Ia型超新星在t=-10天时，UVM2-UVW1的差值超过1.0等级。此外，迄今为止，表现出光变曲线上非单调波动的Ia型超新星仅包括类2002es和类2003fg。研究还发现，在前峰时期，具有双组分幂律上升的Ia型超新星比具有单组分幂律上升的Ia型超新星更亮。基于相似的UV颜色和其他观测相似性，文章讨论了一种可能的母体情景，将类2002es和类2003fg的Ia型超新星置于一个连续体中，并可能解释这些物体之间独特的UV颜色、早期波动等观测相似性。最终，对这两个亚型的进一步观测，特别是在近红外波段，对约束这些异常热核爆炸模型至关重要。<br /><br />总结: 本研究通过对42个Ia型超新星样本的研究发现，类2002es和类2003fg的SNe Ia在UV颜色和光变曲线方面与其他亚型有所不同。此外，具有非单调波动和双组分幂律上升的SNe Ia比具有单组分幂律上升的更亮。文章讨论了这两种亚型可能存在的母体情景，并强调了对它们的进一步观测的重要性。 <div>
We collect a sample of 42 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) with Swift UV photometry and well-measured early time light-curve rises and find that 2002es-like and 2003fg-like SNe Ia have different prepeak UV color evolutions compared to normal SNe Ia and other spectroscopic subtypes. Specifically, 2002es-like and 2003fg-like SNe Ia are cleanly separated from other SNe Ia subtypes by UVM2 − UVW1 ≳ 1.0 mag at t = − 10 days relative to B-band maximum. Furthermore, the SNe Ia that exhibit nonmonotonic bumps in their rising light curves, to date, consist solely of 2002es-like and 2003fg-like SNe Ia. We also find that SNe Ia with two-component power-law rises are more luminous than SNe Ia with single-component power-law rises at prepeak epochs. Given the similar UV colors, along with other observational similarities, we discuss a possible progenitor scenario that places 2002es-like and 2003fg-like SNe Ia along a continuum and may explain the unique UV colors, early time bumps, and other observational similarities between these objects. Ultimately, further observations of both subtypes, especially in the near-infrared, are critical for constraining models of these peculiar thermonuclear explosions.

<title>Radial Spectral Evolution of the Elsässer Variable z − in the Slow Solar Wind</title>

<div> 关键词: Elsässer variable, 太阳风湍流, Parker Solar Probe, 功率谱, 观测约束

总结:
Elsässer variable z−的性质对于理解太阳风湍流起着重要作用。Parker Solar Probe的测量结果显示，在0.1至0.5天文单位范围内，z−的平均谱未显示出低频断点。在频率范围为10^−4–10^−2 Hz，能量在0.1至0.5天文单位范围内出现径向衰减，并在1天文单位附近保持几乎恒定。在1天文单位附近，z−的谱指数逐渐下降至-1.70。此外，∥, ⊥1, 和⊥2分量在场向坐标系中的径向行为与z−的痕迹类似。这些发现为太阳风湍流模型提供了强有力的观测约束。 <br /><br /> <div>
The nature of the Elsässer variable z− plays a significant role in the understanding of solar wind turbulence. The radial spectral evolution of z− observed by the Helios spacecraft suggests that z− has a persistent background spectrum in the low-frequency range from 0.3 to 1 au. However, the radial evolution in the near-Sun solar wind remains unknown. Here we use Parker Solar Probe measurements to analyze the averaged spectra of z− in the slow solar wind from 0.1 to 0.5 au and compare the results with the WIND observations at 1 au. We find that the averaged spectra of z− do not show the low-frequency break at the low-frequency breakpoint on the power spectra of z+, magnetic field, and velocity. The energy in the frequency range of 10−4–10−2 Hz demonstrates a radial decay from 0.1 to 0.5 au and keeps nearly constant to 1 au. The spectral index of z− gradually decreases from −1.27 at 0.1–0.2 au to −1.59 at 0.4–0.5 au and then slowly declines to −1.70 at 1 au. The radial behaviors of the ∥, ⊥1, and ⊥2 components of z− in the field-aligned coordinates are similar to that of the trace of z−. Our findings suggest a faster radial spectral evolution of z− in the near-Sun solar wind and provide strong observational constraints for the solar wind turbulence model.

总结: 这篇论文研究了关于空间等离子体中多维指数与温度各向异性之间的关系。研究基于双绝热方程和有限Larmor半径修正进行推导，提出了考虑温度各向异性、流速和等离子体磁场的多维指数关系。进一步分析了准平行和准垂直情况下的多维指数，并得出了一个关于温度各向异性的多维指数函数。利用这个结果，对来自Ulysses航天器数据的质子参数进行了分析，发现了平均多维指数约为1.43。这个值与最近发表的结果接近，但与以往的统计研究不同，本研究计算了多维指数而不依赖于幂律拟合，其变化现在与温度各向异性相关。 <br /><br /> <div>
The polytropic index is a fundamental physical parameter related to the thermodynamic processes present in space and astrophysical plasmas. This paper investigates the theoretical relationship between the polytropic index and the temperature anisotropy for flow parameters relevant to space plasmas. The derivation is based on the Chew–Goldberger–Low double-adiabatic equations of state and the finite Larmor radius correction. On the basis of this, we present the polytropic index relation, taking into account the temperature anisotropy, flow speed, and magnetic field of the plasma. This relation was further analyzed for the limit of the quasi-parallel and quasi-transversal cases. The quasi-transversal limit gives a polytropic index as a function of the anisotropic temperature γ = 1 + 2[2T⊥ − T∥]/[2T⊥ + T∥]. Using this result, we analyze the polytropic index for the bulk proton parameters derived from Ulysses spacecraft data spanning the interval from 1992 January 1 to 2009 June 30, and we find an average polytropic index of γ ∼ 1.43. This value is close to that of recently published results. However, unlike previous statistical studies, this research computes the polytropic index without relying on power-law fitting, and its variation is now associated with the anisotropic temperature.

总结: <br />
该研究使用光谱测量方法分析了七个邻近星系中H ii区的电子温度。研究发现不同离子测量的温度存在系统性差异，[O ii]和[S ii]的温度可能被电子密度不均匀性高估。同时，在一些具有高分子气体速度色散和低电离参数的区域中测得了较高的[O iii]温度，这可能是由低速冲击波导致的。与以往研究一致的是，[N ii]和[S iii]的温度具有最低的散布，并且与光电离模型预测相一致，这表明这些标量更好地反映了H ii区跨各种电离区的温度。 <br /> <div>
H ii region electron temperatures are a critical ingredient in metallicity determinations, and recent observations have revealed systematic variations in the temperatures measured using different ions. We present electron temperatures (Te) measured using the optical auroral lines ([N ii]λ5756, [O ii]λλ7320, 7330, [S ii]λλ4069, 4076, [O iii]λ4363, and [S iii]λ6312) for a sample of H ii regions in seven nearby galaxies. We use observations from the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby Galaxies survey (PHANGS) obtained with integral field spectrographs on Keck (Keck Cosmic Web Imager) and the Very Large Telescope (Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer). We compare the different Te measurements with H ii region and ISM environmental properties such as electron density, ionization parameter, molecular gas velocity dispersion, and stellar association/cluster mass and age obtained from PHANGS. We find that the temperatures from [O ii] and [S ii] are likely overestimated due to the presence of electron density inhomogeneities in H ii regions. We measure high [O iii] temperatures in a subset of regions with high molecular gas velocity dispersion and low ionization parameter, which may be explained by the presence of low-velocity shocks. In agreement with previous studies, the Te–Te between [N ii] and [S iii] temperatures have the lowest observed scatter and follow predictions from photoionization modeling, which suggests that these tracers reflect H ii region temperatures across the various ionization zones better than [O ii], [S ii], and [O iii].

<br /><br />总结: 这项工作通过射电观测揭示了高速吸积状态下的黑洞射流现象，为我们理解这种极端状态下黑洞生长提供了重要线索，也支持了AGN/X射线双星的类比。 <div>
Accretion of black holes at near-Eddington or super-Eddington rates represents the most powerful episode driving black hole growth, potentially occurring across various types of objects. However, the physics governing accretion and jet–disk coupling in such states remains unclear, primarily due to the difficulty in detecting associated jets, which may emit extremely weakly or exhibit episodic behavior. Only a few near/super-Eddington systems have demonstrated radio activity, and it remains uncertain whether jets exist and what their properties are in super-Eddington active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and ultraluminous X-ray sources. This uncertainty stems mainly from the complex radio emission mix, which includes contributions from jets, star formation activity, photoionized gas, accretion disk wind, and coronal activity. In this work, we conducted high-resolution, very long baseline interferometry observations to investigate jets in the highly accreting narrow-line Seyfert I system I Zw 1. Our observations successfully revealed small-scale jets (with a linear size of ∼45 pc) at both 1.5 and 5 GHz, based on the high radio brightness temperature, radio morphology, and spectral index distribution. Additionally, the parsec-scale jet observed in I Zw 1 displays a knotted morphology reminiscent of other sources accreting at similar rates. In summary, the high accretion rates and jet properties observed in the AGN I Zw 1 may support the AGN/X-ray binary analogy in this extreme state.

Measuring the relation between star formation and galactic winds is observationally difficult. In this work we make an indirect measurement of the mass-loading factor (the ratio between the mass outflow rate and star formation rate) in low-mass galaxies using a differential approach to modeling the low-redshift evolution of the star-forming main sequence and mass–metallicity relation. We use Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) background galaxies, i.e., spectra observed by the SAGA Survey that are not associated with the main SAGA host galaxies, to construct a sample of 11,925 spectroscopically confirmed low-mass galaxies from 0.01 ≲ z ≤ 0.21 and measure auroral line metallicities for 120 galaxies. The crux of the method is to use the lowest-redshift galaxies as the boundary condition of our model, and to infer a mass-loading factor for the sample by comparing the expected evolution of the low-redshift reference sample in stellar mass, gas-phase metallicity, and star formation rate against the observed properties of the sample at higher redshift. We infer a mass-loading factor of , which is in line with direct measurements of the mass-loading factor from the literature despite the drastically different sets of assumptions needed for each approach. While our estimate of the mass-loading factor is in good agreement with recent galaxy simulations that focus on resolving the dynamics of the interstellar medium, it is smaller by over an order of magnitude than the mass-loading factor produced by many contemporary cosmological simulations.

We leverage recent numerical simulations of highly resolved star-forming regions in a Milky Way–like galaxy to explore the nature of extended gaseous envelopes around molecular clouds. We extract a sample of two dozen star-forming clouds from the feedback-dominated suite of Cloud Factory simulations. With the goal of exploring the 3D thermal and chemical structure of the gas, we measure and fit the clouds’ radial profiles with multiple tracers, including , , , nCO, and gas temperature. We find that while solar neighborhood clouds recently detected via 3D dust mapping have radially symmetric, low-density envelopes that extend ∼10–15 pc, the simulated cloud envelopes are primarily radially asymmetric with low-density envelopes that extend only ∼2–3 pc. One potential explanation for the absence of extended envelopes in the simulated clouds may be the lack of magnetic fields, while a stronger local feedback prescription compared to solar neighborhood conditions may drive the radially asymmetric cloud morphologies. We make the pipeline used to extract and characterize the radial profiles of the clouds publicly available, which can be used in complementary and future simulations to shed additional light on the key physics shaping the formation and evolution of star-forming structures in the Milky Way.

这项研究利用Green Bank望远镜对49个Fermi大面积望远镜（LAT）1FGL目录伽马射线源进行了射电脉冲搜索，发现了18颗毫秒脉冲星（MSPs），其中10颗是我们的独立发现。在这些发现中，16颗是双星系统，其中8颗轨道周期PB < 1天。没有发现年轻的脉冲星的射电脉冲，但有3个目标与LAT数据中发现的伽马射线暂未发现的脉冲星重合。此外，他们对10颗MSPs进行了射电和伽马射线的定时测量。研究表明，在高银道纬度的大部分银河伽马射线源要么是MSPs，要么是相对附近的非再循环脉冲星，而后者的射电/伽马射线波束比通常比MSPs小。同时也证实了以前的调查存在针对短PB MSP系统的观察偏差。<br /><br />总结: 这项研究利用射电望远镜对49个伽马射线源进行了毫秒脉冲星的探测，发现了18颗新的毫秒脉冲星，并对其中10颗进行了详细研究。研究结果表明，大部分银河伽马射线源要么是毫秒脉冲星，要么是附近的非再循环脉冲星。这一发现对我们理解银河系中的脉冲星有着重要的意义。 <div>
We have searched for radio pulsations toward 49 Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) 1FGL Catalog γ-ray sources using the Green Bank Telescope at 350 MHz. We detected 18 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in blind searches of the data; 10 of these were discoveries unique to our survey. 16 are binaries, with eight having short orbital periods PB < 1 day. No radio pulsations from young pulsars were detected, although three targets are coincident with apparently radio-quiet γ-ray pulsars discovered in LAT data. Here, we give an overview of the survey and present radio and γ-ray timing results for the 10 MSPs discovered. These include the only isolated MSP discovered in our survey and six short-PB binary MSPs. Of these, three have very-low-mass companions (Mc ≪ 0.1 M⊙) and hence belong to the class of black widow pulsars. Two have more massive, nondegenerate companions with extensive radio eclipses and orbitally modulated X-ray emission consistent with the redback class. Significant γ-ray pulsations have been detected from nine of the discoveries. This survey and similar efforts suggest that the majority of Galactic γ-ray sources at high Galactic latitudes are either MSPs or relatively nearby nonrecycled pulsars, with the latter having on average a much smaller radio/γ-ray beaming ratio as compared to MSPs. It also confirms that past surveys suffered from an observational bias against finding short-PB MSP systems.

<div> RR Lyrae stars, standard candles, photometric variability, Galactic structure, Milky Way halo

在Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS)中，通过对加拿大-法国-夏威夷望远镜/ MegaCam的光变测量，发现了遥远的RR Lyrae星，其中一些是银河系暗物质含量已知的最遥远的恒星，它们的银心距约为300 kpc。利用基于经验斯隆数字化天空调查条带82的RR Lyrae数据的模板光变拟合方法，成功鉴定了NGVS数据集中的180个RR Lyrae候选星。这些新发现的遥远RR Lyrae星是银河系暗物质含量和星系结构研究中的重要补充。通过对这些星的测量，研究人员得出了银河系暗物质分布、金属丰度和星系结构的重要信息。总结：<br /><br />这篇文章报告了通过NGVS对银河系暗物质含量、星系结构和金属丰度的研究，其中利用时间序列光变测量找到了180个遥远的RR Lyrae星。这些星的分布表明暗物质含量和金属丰度随距离的增加而变化。这些研究结果对于理解银河系的结构和演化具有重要意义。 <div>
RR Lyrae stars are standard candles with characteristic photometric variability and serve as powerful tracers of Galactic structure, substructure, accretion history, and dark matter content. Here we report the discovery of distant RR Lyrae stars, including some of the most distant stars known in the Milky Way halo, with Galactocentric distances of ∼300 kpc. We use time-series Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope/MegaCam photometry from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS). We use a template light-curve fitting method based on empirical Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82 RR Lyrae data to identify RR Lyrae candidates in the NGVS data set. We eliminate several hundred suspected quasars and identify 180 RR Lyrae candidates with heliocentric distances of ∼20–300 kpc. The halo stellar density distribution is consistent with an r−4.09±0.10 power-law radial profile over most of this distance range with no signs of a break. The distribution of ab-type RR Lyrae in a period–amplitude plot (Bailey diagram) suggests that the mean metallicity of the halo decreases outward. Compared to other recent RR Lyrae surveys, like Pan-STARRS1, the High Cadence Transient Survey, and the Dark Energy Survey, our NGVS study has better single-epoch photometric precision and a comparable number of epochs but smaller sky coverage. At large distances, our RR Lyrae sample appears to be relatively pure and complete, with well-measured periods and amplitudes. These newly discovered distant RR Lyrae stars are important additions to the few secure stellar tracers beyond 150 kpc in the Milky Way halo.

<div> Blazars, variability, TESS mission, correction methods, light curves
<br /><br />总结:
本文通过对11个明亮的类星体进行研究，比较了六种不同的方法（回归、共轭基向量、像素级去相关、eleanor、quaver和简单的差分光度法）的性能，以确定哪些方法能正确修正TESS光变曲线。通过与ZTF和ATLAS观测数据进行比较，发现只有简单的差分光度法、eleanor和quaver这三种方法产生的TESS光变曲线与地面观测结果一致。研究还进行了功率谱密度斜率比较和对ZTF数据进行最小二乘拟合，以量化光变曲线的其他统计特性。研究结果对于理解类星体的光变行为和识别潜在的中微子源具有重要意义。 <div>
Blazars are characterized by largely aperiodic variability on timescales ranging from minutes to decades across the electromagnetic spectrum. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission provides continuous sampling of blazar variability on timescales ranging from tens of minutes to 27 days for a single sector observation. Proper removal of the background, thermal ramping, and onboard systematic effects are crucial to the extraction of a reliable blazar light curve. Multiple publicly available procedures have been created to correct for these effects. Using ground-based observations from the Zwicky Transit Facility (ZTF) and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) as “ground truth” observations, we compare six different methods (regression, cotrending basis vectors, pixel-level decorrelation, eleanor, quaver, and simple differential photometry) to each other, and to our “ground truth” observations, to identify which methods properly correct light curves of a sample of 11 bright blazars, including the suspected neutrino source TXS 0506+056. In addition to comparing the resulting light curves, we compare the slopes of the power spectral densities, perform least-square fitting to simultaneous ZTF data, and quantify other statistical qualities generated from the light curves of each method. We find that only three of the six methods compared (simple differential photometry, eleanor, and quaver) produce TESS light curves consistent with the ground-based ZTF and ATLAS observations.

<div> ACT, Planck, tomographic measurements, CMB lensing, structure growth
<br />总结:
本研究利用ACT和Planck宇宙微波背景(CMB)透镜图与unWISE蓝光和绿色星系样本的交叉相关分析，进行了结构生长的层析测量。通过包括额外的光谱数据进行红移校准，并采用更灵活的理论模型分析测量结果，改进了先前对unWISE交叉相关的研究。我们发现，利用ACT交叉相关单独测得在低红移(z ≃ 0.2–1.6)上的物质涨落幅度 S8 = 0.810 ± 0.015，结合Planck和ACT的交叉相关测得 S8 = 0.810 ± 0.015；这些测量结果与假设标准结构生长的原始CMB测量预测完全一致。加入声学波动数据去除了σ8和Ωm之间的退化，允许我们从unWISE与ACT的交叉相关中测得σ8 = 0.813 ± 0.020，从与ACT和Planck的联合交叉相关中测得σ8 = 0.813 ± 0.015。这些结果也与ΛCDM宇宙学模型的预期一致；从我们在z∼0.6和1.1的两个红移样本中得出的σ8的一致性进一步验证了我们的宇宙模型。我们的结果表明，甚至在低红移z ≲ 1处，线性尺度上的结构形成也很好地由ΛCDM描述。 <div>
We present tomographic measurements of structure growth using cross-correlations of Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 and Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing maps with the unWISE Blue and Green galaxy samples, which span the redshift ranges 0.2 ≲ z ≲ 1.1 and 0.3 ≲ z ≲ 1.8, respectively. We improve on prior unWISE cross-correlations not just by making use of the new, high-precision ACT DR6 lensing maps, but also by including additional spectroscopic data for redshift calibration and by analyzing our measurements with a more flexible theoretical model. We determine the amplitude of matter fluctuations at low redshifts (z ≃ 0.2–1.6), finding using the ACT cross-correlation alone and S8 = 0.810 ± 0.015 with a combination of Planck and ACT cross-correlations; these measurements are fully consistent with the predictions from primary CMB measurements assuming standard structure growth. The addition of baryon acoustic oscillation data breaks the degeneracy between σ8 and Ωm, allowing us to measure σ8 = 0.813 ± 0.020 from the cross-correlation of unWISE with ACT and σ8 = 0.813 ± 0.015 from the combination of cross-correlations with ACT and Planck. These results also agree with the expectations from primary CMB extrapolations in ΛCDM cosmology; the consistency of σ8 derived from our two redshift samples at z ∼ 0.6 and 1.1 provides a further check of our cosmological model. Our results suggest that structure formation on linear scales is well described by ΛCDM even down to low redshifts z ≲ 1.

<title>Evolutionary Period Changes for 52 Cataclysmic Variables, and the Failure for the Most-fundamental Prediction of the Magnetic Braking Model</title>

<div> 驱动演化的关键词: cataclysmic variables (CVs), period changes, magnetic braking model (MBM), angular momentum loss (AML), evolutionary track
总结:
cataclysmic variables (CVs)的演化受到周期改变的驱动。传统观点认为磁制动模型（MBM）对此起着关键作用，假设AML遵循幂律“配方”。作者收集了52个CVs的测量数据。首先发现44%的CVs具有正值的AML，而这在MBM中是不可能的。其次，即使是负值的AML，其测量值也总是比MBM要求的更负，平均偏差为110×。第三，三个CVs表现出大的混沌波动，这在MBM中也是不可能的，证明存在某种未知机制。第四，MBM未能解释许多新星事件中出现的大幅度周期减小对演化的长期影响，这一影响在大多数新星系统中占主导地位，并改变整体演化的AML的符号。第五，三颗复发新星在新星事件中突然发生一个数量级的变化，这在MBM中也是不可能的。因此，MBM的AML-配方存在数量级上的错误。 <br /><br /> <div>
The evolution of cataclysmic variables (CVs) is driven by period changes ( ), for which the long-venerable consensus is the magnetic braking model (MBM). The MBM has its only distinctive assumption being a power-law “recipe” describing the angular momentum loss (AML) in the binary, producing a single unique evolutionary track with as a function of the orbital period. This required prediction can be used to test the most-fundamental assumption of MBM, but it has never been tested previously. In this paper, I collect measures for 52 CVs of all types. First, 44% of the CVs have positive , with such being impossible in MBM. Second, even among the CVs with negative , their measures are always more negative than required by MBM, with an average deviation of 110×. Third, three CVs have large chaotic variations in that are impossible for MBM, proving that some unknown mechanism exists and is operating that dominates for these systems. Fourth, the MBM does not account for the long-term effects on evolution arising from the large sudden period decreases seen across many nova events, with this unaccounted effect dominating for the majority of nova systems and changing the sign of the overall evolutionary . Fifth, three recurrent novae are observed to suddenly change by an order of magnitude across a nova event, with this being impossible in the MBM. In all, the required MBM predictions all fail for my 52 CVs, usually by orders of magnitude, so the MBM AML-recipe is wrong by orders of magnitude.

星系演化受宇宙网环境影响，特别是对于质量小于10^10.8太阳质量的星系，环境越稀疏，恒星形成率和尘埃含量越高。半解析模型表明，稀疏环境的星系通常具有年轻的恒星群，恒星质量演化缓慢以及滞后的恒星形成过程。而对于质量大于10^10.8太阳质量的星系，环境差异较小，因为模型中的盘不稳定驱动的超大质量黑洞增长使得超大质量黑洞增长和星系扼制与环境无关。观测数据验证了这一结果，特别是在比较低的质量范围内，特定恒星形成率和尘埃质量似乎与环境无关。这一结果证实了超大质量黑洞在星系内部的生长渠道的重要性。 <br /><br />总结: 星系的年轻恒星群、恒星质量演化和恒星形成过程受宇宙网环境的影响，而大质量黑洞增长和星系扼制对环境的影响较小。观测数据验证了这一结果，表明超大质量黑洞在星系内部的生长渠道至关重要。 <div>
The large-scale environment of the cosmic web is believed to impact galaxy evolution, but there is still no consensus regarding the mechanisms. We use a semi-analytic model (SAM) galaxy catalog to study the star formation and dust content of local galaxies in different cosmic environments of the cosmic web—namely voids, filaments, walls, and nodes. We find a strong impact of the environment only for galaxies with Mstars ≲ 1010.8M⊙: the less dense the environment, the larger the star formation rate and dust content at fixed stellar mass. This is attributed to the fact that galaxies in less dense environments typically feature younger stellar populations, a slower evolution of their stellar mass, and delayed star formation compared to galaxies in denser environments. As for galaxies with Mstars ≳ 1010.8M⊙, the differences among environments are milder, due to the disk-instability-driven supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth implemented in the SAM, which makes SMBH growth, and thus galaxy quenching, environment-insensitive. We qualitatively test our predictions against observations by identifying environments in Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 16 using dust masses derived from the GAMA survey. The agreement is encouraging, particularly at , where the specific star formation rates and dust masses appear quite environment-insensitive. This result confirms the importance of in situ growth channels of SMBHs.

<div> 关键词: 太阳风，温度涨落，间歇性加热，太阳轨道器，磁场构型
总结:
太阳风中的质子温度涨落表现出高度的间歇性，尤其是在惯性范围内的小尺度上。这种现象可能包含关于太阳风间歇性加热的信息，然而温度涨落的物理性质尚不清楚。通过2020年9月至2022年9月的太阳轨道器测量数据，研究人员确定了24秒尺度下的185个具有明确定义的最小方差方向的快速太阳风中温度间歇结构，并研究了它们的性质及动力学效应。基于质子温度的变化，间歇结构被分类为温度颠簸、阶跃、低谷和链状四种类型。研究人员发现，在考虑磁场构型和其他等离子体性质时，温度颠簸中有46个主要与镜像波模不稳定性相关的线性磁孔(LMH)，43个与局部温度增强有关的电流片 (CS)。阶跃结构与13个类似激波的结构和8个切向不连续有关。对于低谷结构，其中21个可能与镜像波模不稳定性有关，其余16个可能更偏向孤立子情景。38个链状结构被确定为压缩性类涡旋状结构，其中包含LMH和CS。这些结果有助于进一步理解太阳风湍流中的间歇性耗散过程。 <br /><br /> <div>
In the solar wind turbulence, proton temperature fluctuations are highly intermittent, especially at small scales in the inertial range. This phenomenon may contain information about solar wind intermittent heating. However, the physical nature of the temperature intermittency is not yet clear. Based on the measurements from Solar Orbiter between 2020 September and 2022 September, we identify 185 temperature intermittent structures at the scale of 24 s with well-defined minimum variance direction in the fast solar wind and study the nature and kinetic effects of them. According to the variations of proton temperature, the intermittent structures are classified into four types, including temperature bump, step, dip, and chain. When considering the magnetic field configuration together with other plasma properties, we find that, among the bump cases, 46 of them are linear magnetic holes (LMHs) that are mainly related to mirror-mode (MM) instability, and 43 of them are current sheets (CSs) with local temperature enhancement. The step cases are found to be associated with shock-like structures (13 cases) and tangential discontinuities (eight cases) that separate two different parcels of plasma. For the dip cases, 21 of them could be associated with the MM instability, and the rest of the 16 ones may prefer soliton scenario. The 38 chain cases are identified as compressive vortex-like structures and a mixture of LMHs and CSs. These results will help to further understand the intermittent dissipation process in the solar wind turbulence.

Potentially habitable exoplanets are targets of great interest for the James Webb Space Telescope and upcoming mission concepts such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory. Clouds strongly affect climate and habitability, but predicting their properties is difficult. In Global Climate Models (GCMs), especially those aiming at simulating Earth, cloud microphysics is often crudely approximated by assuming that all cloud particles have a single, constant size or a prescribed size distribution and that all clouds in a grid cell are identical. For exoplanets that range over a large phase space of planetary properties, this method could result in large errors. In this work, our goal is to determine how cloud microphysics on terrestrial exoplanets, whose condensable is mainly water vapor, depend on aerosol properties and planetary parameters such as surface pressure, surface gravity, and incident stellar radiation. We use the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres as a 1D microphysical model to simulate the formation and evolution of clouds including the processes of nucleation, condensation, evaporation, coagulation, and vertical transfer. In these 1D idealized experiments, we find that the parameters that determine the macrophysical thermal structure of the atmospheres, including surface pressure and stellar flux, impact cloud radiative effect (CRE) most significantly. Parameters such as gravity and number density of aerosols working as cloud condensation nuclei affect the microphysical processes of cloud formation, including activation and vertical transfer. They also have a significant, though weaker effect on CRE. This work motivates the development of more accurate GCM cloud schemes and should aid in the interpretation of future observations.

We study the coupling of hydrodynamics and reactions in simulations of the double-detonation model for Type Ia supernovae. When assessing the convergence of simulations, the focus is usually on spatial resolution; however, the method of coupling the physics together as well as the tolerances used in integrating a reaction network also play an important role. In this paper, we explore how the choices made in both coupling and integrating the reaction portion of a simulation (operator/Strang splitting versus the simplified spectral deferred corrections method we introduced previously) influences the accuracy, efficiency, and nucleosynthesis of simulations of double detonations. We find no need to limit reaction rates or reduce the simulation time step to the reaction timescale. The entire simulation methodology used here is GPU-accelerated and made freely available as part of the Castro simulation code.

<br /><br />总结:
该研究的主要目标是通过高光谱分析测量外行星大气特性，以连接我们对大气物理和行星形成的理解。研究比较了三种集成方法来处理模型不确定性，通过结合多个分析的后验分布：贝叶斯模型平均，一种使用留一预测密度的贝叶斯模型平均的变体，以及堆叠预测分布。他们通过拟合不同云和雾处理方式的模型，对热木星HD 209458b的哈勃空间望远镜（HST）+斯皮策先进望远镜的透射光谱进行了演示。所有的集成方法都导致检索参数的不确定性变大，但更真实并与物理化学的期望一致。建议采用堆叠作为最稳健的模型组合方法。这些方法可以用于结合独立检索代码和同一代码内不同模型的结果，并可广泛应用于其他外行星分析过程，如结合不同数据处理的结果。 <div>
A key goal of exoplanet spectroscopy is to measure atmospheric properties, such as abundances of chemical species, in order to connect them to our understanding of atmospheric physics and planet formation. In this new era of high-quality JWST data, it is paramount that these measurement methods are robust. When comparing atmospheric models to observations, multiple candidate models may produce reasonable fits to the data. Typically, conclusions are reached by selecting the best-performing model according to some metric. This ignores model uncertainty in favor of specific model assumptions, potentially leading to measured atmospheric properties that are overconfident and/or incorrect. In this paper, we compare three ensemble methods for addressing model uncertainty by combining posterior distributions from multiple analyses: Bayesian model averaging, a variant of Bayesian model averaging using leave-one-out predictive densities, and stacking of predictive distributions. We demonstrate these methods by fitting the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) + Spitzer transmission spectrum of the hot Jupiter HD 209458b using models with different cloud and haze prescriptions. All of our ensemble methods lead to uncertainties on retrieved parameters that are larger but more realistic and consistent with physical and chemical expectations. Since they have not typically accounted for model uncertainty, uncertainties of retrieved parameters from HST spectra have likely been underreported. We recommend stacking as the most robust model combination method. Our methods can be used to combine results from independent retrieval codes and from different models within one code. They are also widely applicable to other exoplanet analysis processes, such as combining results from different data reductions.

<title>Evidence for an Outer Component in the Continuum Reverberation Mapping of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>

Continuum reverberation mapping is widely used in studying the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Some indirect evidence and simulations have indicated that the diffuse continuum, especially the strong Balmer continuum from the broad-line region, may contribute to the continuum in the u/U band. Here, we present direct evidence for this contribution. In this work, we apply the ICCF-Cut method to continuum reverberation mapping to extract the possible diffuse continuum light curves of six AGNs, using high-cadence, high-quality, and multiband observations. We find the existence of an outer component out of the accretion disk for each of the six AGNs in the Swift U band. Meanwhile, similar results can be derived with the JAVELIN Photometric Reverberation Mapping Model for four of them. The lags of the outer components are consistent with the predicted Balmer continuum lags, which are about half of the Hβ lag values. Our result directly reinforces the understanding that an outer component, especially the Balmer continuum in the rest-frame u/U band, can contribute significantly to the continuum reverberation lags of AGNs.

On 2022 September 5, Parker Solar Probe (Parker) observed a large solar energetic particle (SEP) event at the unprecedented distance of only 15 RS from the Sun. The observations from the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (IS⊙IS) obtained over the course of this event are remarkably rich, and an overview is presented here. IS⊙IS is capable of measuring ions from 20 keV to over 100 MeV nuc−1 and electrons from 30 keV to 6 MeV; here, we primarily focus on the proton and helium measurements above 80 keV. Among the surprising results are evidence of inverse velocity dispersion at energies above 1 MeV during the onset of the event, a sharp decrease in the energetic particle intensities at all energies at the interplanetary shock crossing, and repeated short durations of highly anisotropic sunward flow. Many changes in the SEP intensities, anisotropy, and spectral steepness are coincident with solar wind structure boundaries identified using the Parker solar wind magnetic field and plasma data. However, there are significant changes that are not correlated with any clearly visible solar wind variation. The observations presented here serve as an introduction to a complex event with numerous opportunities for future, more in-depth studies.

<title>Latest Evolution of the X-Ray Remnant of SN 1987A: Beyond the Inner Ring</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3800</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Based on our Chandra imaging-spectroscopic observations, we present the latest evolution of the X-ray remnant of SN 1987A. Recent changes in the electron temperatures and volume emission measures suggest that the blast wave in SN 1987A is moving out of the dense inner ring structure, also called the equatorial ring (ER). The 0.5–2.0 keV X-ray light curve shows a linearly declining trend (by ∼4.5% yr−1) between 2016 and 2020 as the blast wave heats the hitherto unknown circumstellar medium (CSM) outside the ER. While the peak X-ray emission in the latest 0.3–8.0 keV image is still within the ER, the radial expansion rate in the 3.0–8.0 keV images suggests an increasing contribution of the X-ray emission from less dense CSM since 2012, at least partly from beyond the ER. It is remarkable that, since 2020, the declining soft X-ray flux has stabilized around ∼7 × 10−12 erg s−1 cm−2, which may signal a contribution from the reverse-shocked outer layers of ejecta as predicted by the three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic models. In the latest ACIS spectrum of supernova remnant 1987A in 2022 we report a significant detection of the Fe K line at ∼6.7 keV, which may be due to changing thermal conditions of the X-ray emitting CSM and/or the onset of reverse shock interactions with the Fe ejecta.

<title>Stability of C59 Knockout Fragments from Femtoseconds to Infinity</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3930</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have studied the stability of C59 anions as a function of time, from their formation on femtosecond timescales to their stabilization on second timescales and beyond, using a combination of theory and experiments. The fragments were produced in collisions between C60 fullerene anions and neutral helium gas at a velocity of 90 km s−1 (corresponding to a collision energy of 166 eV in the center-of-mass frame). The fragments were then stored in a cryogenic ion beam storage ring at the DESIREE facility, where they were followed for up to 1 minute. Classical molecular dynamics simulations were used to determine the reaction cross section and the excitation energy distributions of the products formed in these collisions. We find that about 15% of the ions initially stored in the ring are intact after about 100 ms and that this population then remains intact indefinitely. This means that C60 fullerenes exposed to energetic atoms and ions, such as stellar winds and shock waves, will produce stable, highly reactive products, like C59, that are fed into interstellar chemical reaction networks.

<title>ASASSN-18ap: A Dusty Tidal Disruption Event Candidate with an Early Bump in the Light Curve</title>

<div> TDE, ASASSN-18ap, supernova, infrared outburst, coronal emission lines
<br /><br />
ASASSN-18ap最初被识别为超新星，但随后的现象表明它更可能是发生在尘埃环境中的潮汐撕裂事件。红外暴增的总能量远高于光至紫外范围的能量，暗示存在大量尘埃遮蔽、额外的极紫外成分或非均向的连续辐射。在明亮的起始阶段光变曲线出现了不规则的特征，这可能会提供关于光学发射的起源的见解。这些新发现有助于重新评估ASASSN-18ap的分类。
<br /><br />总结: ASASSN-18ap最可能是潮汐撕裂事件而非超新星，观测到了红外暴增和冕发射线，光变曲线的不规则特征为我们提供了新的见解。 <div>
We reexamined the classification of the optical transient ASASSN-18ap, which was initially identified as a supernova (SN) upon its discovery. Based on newly emerged phenomena, such as a delayed luminous infrared outburst and the emergence of luminous coronal emission lines, we suggest that ASASSN-18ap is more likely a tidal disruption event (TDE) in a dusty environment, rather than an SN. The total energy in the infrared outburst is 3.1 × 1051 erg, which is an order of magnitude higher than the total energy in the optical-to-UV range, indicating a large dust extinction, an extra-extreme ultraviolet component, or anisotropic continuum emission. A bumpy feature appeared in the optical light curve at the start of brightening, which was reported in a couple of TDEs very recently. This early bump may have been overlooked in the past, due to the lack of sufficient sampling of the light curves of most TDEs during their ascending phase, and it could provide insight into the origin of optical emission.

<br />总结:
本文研究了ACT天文望远镜数据释放6版（DR6）数据的宇宙微波背景（CMB）透镜功率谱分析中外星系前景的影响和缓解方法。通过两个独立的微波天空模拟来测试一系列缓解策略。研究表明，找到并减去点源、找到并减去团簇模型，以及使用最大限度减小剖面偏差的透镜估计器，可以将偏差降低到远远低于统计误差，透镜幅度Alens的推断偏差小于0.2σ。另外，我们还展示了另一种方法，即反投影宇宙红外背景（CIB）贡献模型并包含来自Planck的高频数据，其表现类似。其他清理频率的选项效果不佳，要么造成较大的噪声成本，要么导致透镜光谱的偏差恢复。除了这些基于模拟的测试外，我们还对ACT DR6数据进行了零测试，以检验我们的透镜谱估计对两个ACT使用的频率之间的前景水平差异的敏感性，同时取消CMB透镜信号。这些测试无论是在地图级别还是在波段功率级别进行了空化，均通过了测试。在DR6数据上执行的CIB反投影测量与我们的基线测量一致，表明CIB的污染不太可能显著偏离DR6透镜谱。这些测试的集合确保ACT DR6透镜测量和伴随论文中提出的宇宙学约束对外星系前景是健壮的。 <div>
We investigate the impact and mitigation of extragalactic foregrounds for the cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing power spectrum analysis of Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data release 6 (DR6) data. Two independent microwave sky simulations are used to test a range of mitigation strategies. We demonstrate that finding and then subtracting point sources, finding and then subtracting models of clusters, and using a profile bias-hardened lensing estimator together reduce the fractional biases to well below statistical uncertainties, with the inferred lensing amplitude, Alens, biased by less than 0.2σ. We also show that another method where a model for the cosmic infrared background (CIB) contribution is deprojected and high-frequency data from Planck is included has similar performance. Other frequency-cleaned options do not perform as well, either incurring a large noise cost or resulting in biased recovery of the lensing spectrum. In addition to these simulation-based tests, we also present null tests on the ACT DR6 data for sensitivity of our lensing spectrum estimation to differences in foreground levels between the two ACT frequencies used, while nulling the CMB lensing signal. These tests pass whether the nulling is performed at the map or bandpower level. The CIB-deprojected measurement performed on the DR6 data is consistent with our baseline measurement, implying that contamination from the CIB is unlikely to significantly bias the DR6 lensing spectrum. This collection of tests gives confidence that the ACT DR6 lensing measurements and cosmological constraints presented in companion papers to this work are robust to extragalactic foregrounds.

总结:<br />
这篇文章报告了关于磁体星短暂爆发的引力波探测结果。研究通过对13次磁体星爆发事件的Advanced LIGO、Advanced Virgo和KAGRA第三次观测运行期间进行搜索，未发现任何与这些爆发事件相关的引力波。得到的上限值为短时搜索时在100Hz时达到3.6 × 10−23，长时搜索时在450Hz时达到1.1 × 10−22。根据磁体星的估计距离，推导出短时和长时搜索时引力波能量的上限。假设电磁辐射能量的各向同性发射，推断出来自SGR 1935+2154的引力波能量与电磁能量之比的最低值为4.5 × 103。 <div>
Gravitational waves are expected to be produced from neutron star oscillations associated with magnetar giant flares and short bursts. We present the results of a search for short-duration (milliseconds to seconds) and long-duration (∼100 s) transient gravitational waves from 13 magnetar short bursts observed during Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo, and KAGRA’s third observation run. These 13 bursts come from two magnetars, SGR 1935+2154 and Swift J1818.0−1607. We also include three other electromagnetic burst events detected by Fermi-GBM which were identified as likely coming from one or more magnetars, but they have no association with a known magnetar. No magnetar giant flares were detected during the analysis period. We find no evidence of gravitational waves associated with any of these 16 bursts. We place upper limits on the rms of the integrated incident gravitational-wave strain that reach 3.6 × 10−23 at 100 Hz for the short-duration search and 1.1 × 10−22 at 450 Hz for the long-duration search. For a ringdown signal at 1590 Hz targeted by the short-duration search the limit is set to 2.3 × 10−22 . Using the estimated distance to each magnetar, we derive upper limits on the emitted gravitational-wave energy of 1.5 × 1044 erg (1.0 × 1044 erg) for SGR 1935+2154 and 9.4 × 1043 erg (1.3 × 1044 erg) for Swift J1818.0−1607, for the short-duration (long-duration) search. Assuming isotropic emission of electromagnetic radiation of the burst fluences, we constrain the ratio of gravitational-wave energy to electromagnetic energy for bursts from SGR 1935+2154 with the available fluence information. The lowest of these ratios is 4.5 × 103.

总结:<br />
本文分析了 SN 2022pul 的地基和 JWST 观测结果，该超新星属于“03fg-like”类型，处于338天的星云相。与普通的 SN Ia 2021aefx 相比，SN 2022pul 的平均电离态较低，具有不对称的发射线轮廓，较强的中等质量元素（IME）氩和钙发射，较弱的铁族元素（IGE）发射，以及 SN Ia 的第一个明确检测到的氖。作者对现有模型进行了修改，添加了块状喷射来更好地重现光学铁发射线，同时在内部区域（<2000 km/s）增加了质量来解释观测到的窄 [O i] λλ6300, 6364 发射线。这些观察结果支持了暴力白矮星（WD）合并的模型解释，有利于解释 03fg-like 类型 SNe Ia 的子类。 <div>
We present an analysis of ground-based and JWST observations of SN 2022pul, a peculiar “03fg-like” (or “super-Chandrasekhar”) Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), in the nebular phase at 338 days postexplosion. Our combined spectrum continuously covers 0.4–14 μm and includes the first mid-infrared spectrum of a 03fg-like SN Ia. Compared to normal SN Ia 2021aefx, SN 2022pul exhibits a lower mean ionization state, asymmetric emission-line profiles, stronger emission from the intermediate-mass elements (IMEs) argon and calcium, weaker emission from iron-group elements (IGEs), and the first unambiguous detection of neon in a SN Ia. A strong, broad, centrally peaked [Ne ii] line at 12.81 μm was previously predicted as a hallmark of “violent merger” SN Ia models, where dynamical interaction between two sub-MCh white dwarfs (WDs) causes disruption of the lower-mass WD and detonation of the other. The violent merger scenario was already a leading hypothesis for 03fg-like SNe Ia; in SN 2022pul it can explain the large-scale ejecta asymmetries seen between the IMEs and IGEs and the central location of narrow oxygen and broad neon. We modify extant models to add clumping of the ejecta to reproduce the optical iron emission better, and add mass in the innermost region (<2000 km s−1) to account for the observed narrow [O i] λλ6300, 6364 emission. A violent WD–WD merger explains many of the observations of SN 2022pul, and our results favor this model interpretation for the subclass of 03fg-like SNe Ia.

<div> 关键词: H i emission, Magellanic Stream, ultraviolet absorbers, Wasserstein distance, ionized gas

总结: 
本文介绍了一种新技术，用于识别麦哲伦星流(MS)中的H i发射与附近92个QSO视线处的紫外线吸收体之间的关联。他们使用Wasserstein距离模型量化了H i元素与星流主体之间的关联程度，推导了MS中H i发射的特征空间和动力学距离。通过应用基于发射的模型，他们进一步开发了一个比较指标，用于确定UV吸收体与MS及附近星系的主要关联。研究发现，对于由C ii, C iv, Si ii, Si iii, Si iv探测的与MS相关的电离气体，其离子柱密度一般比不相关的高约0.5 dex，并且在MS尾部，气体更加电离，这体现在C ii/C iv比率的空间趋势上。他们还发现了与M33和NGC 300星系周星际介质相关的潜在新吸收体，并确认了与IC 1613和Wolf–Lundmark–Mellote星系的关联。对于M31，他们发现了与冲击参数的柱密度梯度，并且M31的银河半径外具有更高柱密度的吸收体更有可能与MS相关。他们的分析还揭示了MS和云之间连续且混合的弥散电离气体。这项技术可以应用于未来对复杂气态结构内部的关联的研究。 <br /><br /> <div>
We present a new technique to identify associations of H i emission in the Magellanic Stream (MS) and ultraviolet (UV) absorbers from 92 QSO sight lines near the MS. We quantify the level of associations of individual H i elements to the main H i body of the Stream using Wasserstein distance-based models, and derive characteristic spatial and kinematic distances of the H i emission in the MS. With the emission-based model, we further develop a comparison metric, which identifies the dominant associations of individual UV absorbers with respect to the MS and nearby galaxies. For ionized gas associated with the MS probed by C ii, C iv, Si ii, Si iii, Si iv, we find that the ion column densities are generally ∼0.5 dex higher than those that are not associated, and that the gas is more ionized toward the tail of the MS as indicated by the spatial trend of the C ii/C iv ratios. For nearby galaxies, we identify potential new absorbers associated with the circumgalactic medium of M33 and NGC 300, and affirm the associations of absorbers with IC 1613 and the Wolf–Lundmark–Mellote galaxy. For M31, we find the previously identified gradient in column densities as a function of the impact parameter, and that absorbers with higher column densities beyond M31's virial radius are more likely to be associated with the MS. Our analysis of absorbers associated with the Magellanic Clouds reveals the presence of continuous and blended diffuse ionized gas between the Stream and the Clouds. Our technique can be applied to future applications of identifying associations within physically complex gaseous structures.

总结:  
本研究利用哈勃太空望远镜对23个红移在4至6之间的长时域伽马射线暴宿主星系进行了紫外光度和大小-光度关系的研究。研究发现，这些伽马射线暴宿主星系在红移z∼5时的性质与同一红移处的Lyman-break星系相似，证实了它们代表同一种类星系的预期。此外，本研究发现，有大约68%的大小-光度测量结果在或低于红移z∼4的Lyman-break星系的相同关系内。研究还表明，伽马射线暴能够作为探测高红移宇宙中隐藏星形成的有效方法。研究还发现，假设伽马射线暴能够无偏地追踪红移z∼5的星形成，那么我们的样本中未检测到的比例7/23与星系光度在我们检测限制M1600Å≈ −18.3 mag之下的一致性在95%的置信水平上是一致的，这表明了约13%–53%的红移z∼5的星形成发生在比我们的检测限制暗的星系中。 <div>
We present rest-frame UV Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the largest and most complete sample of 23 long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxies between redshifts 4 and 6. Of these 23, we present new WFC3/F110W imaging for 19 of the hosts, which we combine with archival WFC3/F110W and WFC3/F140W imaging for the remaining four. We use the photometry of the host galaxies from this sample to characterize both the rest-frame UV luminosity function (LF) and the size–luminosity relation of the sample. We find that when assuming the standard Schechter-function parameterization for the UV LF, the GRB host sample is best fit with and mag, which are consistent with results based on z ∼ 5 Lyman-break galaxies. We find that ∼68% of our size–luminosity measurements fall within or below the same relation for Lyman-break galaxies at z ∼ 4. This study observationally confirms expectations that at z ∼ 5 Lyman-break and GRB host galaxies should trace the same population and demonstrates the utility of GRBs as probes of hidden star formation in the high-redshift Universe. Under the assumption that GRBs unbiasedly trace star formation at this redshift, our nondetection fraction of 7/23 is consistent at the 95% confidence level with 13%–53% of star formation at redshift z ∼ 5 occurring in galaxies fainter than our detection limit of M1600Å ≈ −18.3 mag.

ALMA观测和哈勃空间望远镜近红外成像显示，NGC 4786和NGC 5193的中心区域含有一个环状星盘，显示出约270 km/s的有序旋转速度。研究团队通过构建气体动力学模型并将其直接与ALMA数据立方体进行拟合，测量了这两个星系中心的黑洞质量，并分别为NGC 4786和NGC 5193。然而，ALMA观测并未完全解析出黑洞影响范围，也没有显示出中心旋转速度的上升，这表明未探测到SOI内部的发射。此外，测量中的最大误差来自宿主星系模型中与消光校正相关的系统性不确定性。这凸显了评估尘埃衰减对推断的黑洞质量的影响的重要性。<br /><br />总结: 本研究利用ALMA观测和气体动力学模型测量了NGC 4786和NGC 5193巨型椭圆星系中心的黑洞质量，结果显示两个星系中心可能存在大质量的黑洞。然而，由于ALMA观测未能完全解析出黑洞影响范围，并且消光校正的系统误差较大，黑洞质量的准确性尚待进一步确认。 <div>
We present molecular gas-dynamical mass measurements of the central black holes in the giant elliptical galaxies NGC 4786 and NGC 5193, based on CO (2−1) observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and Hubble Space Telescope near-infrared imaging. The central region in each galaxy contains a circumnuclear disk that exhibits orderly rotation with projected line-of-sight velocities of ∼270 km s−1. We build gas-dynamical models for the rotating disk in each galaxy and fit them directly to the ALMA data cubes. At 0.″31 resolution, the ALMA observations do not fully resolve the black hole sphere of influence (SOI), and neither galaxy exhibits a central rise in rotation speed, indicating that emission from deep within the SOI is not detected. As a result, our models do not tightly constrain the central black hole mass in either galaxy, but they prefer the presence of a central massive object in both galaxies. We measure the black hole mass to be in NGC 4786 and in NGC 5193. The largest component of each measurement’s error budget is from the systematic uncertainty associated with the extinction correction in the host galaxy models. This underscores the importance of assessing the impact of dust attenuation on the inferred MBH.

<div> dissipative self-interacting dark matter, baryonic zoom-in simulations, dwarf galaxies, Milky Way–mass hosts, circular velocity constraints
总结:<br /><br />本文使用了FIRE-2星系形成物理模型，将耗散暗物质自相互作用建模为常数分数能量耗散(fdiss = 0.75)，并通过宇宙学纯离子耗散耗散暗物质（dSIDM）的首个巴里昂缩放模拟来研究恒星等级为105-109M⊙的矮星系的性质。结果表明，在孤立的矮星系中，dSIDM模型能够产生更紧凑的星系尺寸并促进盘形成。然而，与观测的大小-质量关系相矛盾的是，当(σ/m) = 10 cm2 g−1时，星系的分布变得蓬松。另外，耗散暗物质会增强矮星系的亚千秒圆速度，这与局部星系群矮星系的运动测量一致，但与更大质量的场矮星系的H i旋转曲线存在矛盾。对于银河质量的卫星，dSIDM对中值圆速度轮廓的影响不大，但能够促进矮星卫星的结构多样性。总的来说，在质量较大的矮星系(Mhalo ∼ 1011M⊙)中，dSIDM模型存在圆速度约束的矛盾。然而，在更低有效截面的模型仍然是可行的，并且可以产生观测上的非平凡特征。 <div>
We analyze the first cosmological baryonic zoom-in simulations of galaxies in dissipative self-interacting dark matter (dSIDM). The simulations utilize the FIRE-2 galaxy formation physics with the inclusion of dissipative dark matter self-interactions modeled as a constant fractional energy dissipation (fdiss = 0.75). In this paper, we examine the properties of dwarf galaxies with M* ∼ 105–109M⊙ in both isolation and within Milky Way–mass hosts. For isolated dwarfs, we find more compact galaxy sizes and promotion of disk formation in dSIDM with (σ/m) ≤ 1 cm2 g−1. On the contrary, models with (σ/m) = 10 cm2 g−1 produce puffier stellar distributions that are in tension with the observed size–mass relation. In addition, owing to the steeper central density profiles, the subkiloparsec circular velocities of isolated dwarfs when (σ/m) ≥ 0.1 cm2 g−1 are enhanced by about a factor of 2, which are still consistent with the kinematic measurements of Local Group dwarfs but in tension with the H i rotation curves of more massive field dwarfs. Meanwhile, for satellites of Milky Way–mass hosts, the median circular velocity profiles are marginally affected by dSIDM physics, but dSIDM may help promote the structural diversity of dwarf satellites. The number of satellites is slightly enhanced in dSIDM, but the differences are small compared with the large host-to-host variations. In conclusion, the dSIDM models with (σ/m) ≳ 0.1 cm2 g−1, fdiss = 0.75 are in tension in massive dwarfs (Mhalo ∼ 1011M⊙) due to circular velocity constraints. However, models with lower effective cross sections (at this halo mass/velocity scale) are still viable and can produce nontrivial observable signatures.

总结: <br /><br />这篇文章研究了活动星系核（AGNs）的变化特征，发现了一种新的变化型AGNs，通过Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)光变数据和后续光谱数据，成功确定了Type 1和Type 2 AGNs，并确认了35个turn-on和12个turn-off的CL AGN候选者。CL AGNs的发生率约为0.3%，并且确认了CL转变通常发生在Eddington比率≲0.01。这项研究为我们对AGNs的理解和分类提供了新的线索。 <div>
Changing-look (CL) active galactic nuclei (AGNs), characterized by the appearance/disappearance of broad emission lines in the span of a few years, present a challenge for the AGN unified model, whereby the Type 1 versus Type 2 dichotomy results from orientation effects alone. We present a systematic study of a large sample of spectroscopically classified AGNs, using optical variability data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) as well as follow-up spectroscopy data. We demonstrate that Type 1 and Type 2 AGNs can be neatly separated on the basis of the variability metric σQSO, which quantifies the resemblance of a light curve to a damped random walk model. For a small subsample, however, the ZTF light curves are inconsistent with their previous classification, suggesting the occurrence of a CL event. Specifically, we identify 35 (12) turn-on (turn-off) CL AGN candidates at z < 0.35. Based on follow-up spectroscopy, we confirm 17 (4) turn-on (turn-off) CL AGNs out of 21 (5) candidates, representing a high success rate for our method. Our results suggest that the occurrence rate of CL AGNs is ∼0.3% over timescales of 5–20 yr, and confirm that the CL transition typically occurs at an Eddington ratio of ≲0.01.

One of the major processes that solar wind drives is the outflow and escape of ions from the planetary atmospheres. The major ion species in the upper ionospheres of both Earth and Mars is O+, and hence it is more likely to dominate the escape process. On Earth, due to a strong intrinsic magnetic field, the major ion outflow pathways are through the cusp, polar cap, and the auroral oval. In contrast, Mars has an induced magnetosphere, where the ionosphere is in direct contact with the shocked solar wind plasma. Therefore, physical processes underlying the ion energization and escape rates are expected to be different on Mars as compared to Earth. In the current work, we study the near-simultaneous ion outflow event from both Earth and Mars during the passage of a stream interaction region/high-speed stream (SIR/HSS) during 2016 May, when both the planets were approximately aligned on the same side of the Sun. The SIR/HSS propagation was recorded by spacecraft at the Sun–Earth L1 point and Mars Express at 1.5 au. During the passage of the SIR, the dayside and nightside ion outflows at Earth were observed by Van Allen Probes and Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission orbiters, respectively. At Mars, the ion energization at different altitudes was observed by the STATIC instrument on board the MAVEN orbiter. We observe evidence for the enhanced ion outflow from both Earth and Mars during the passage of the SIR, and identify the dominant drivers of the ion outflow.

The supernova remnant (SNR) 0540–69.3, twin of the Crab Nebula, offers an excellent opportunity to study the continuum emission from a young pulsar and pulsar wind nebula (PWN). We present observations taken with the Very Large Telescope instruments MUSE and X-shooter in the wavelength range 3000–25000 Å, which allow us to study spatial variations of the optical spectra, along with the first near-infrared (NIR) spectrum of the source. We model the optical spectra with a power law (PL) Fν ∝ ν−α and find clear spatial variations (including a torus–jet structure) in the spectral index across the PWN. Generally, we find spectral hardening toward the outer parts, from α ∼ 1.1 to ∼0.1, which may indicate particle reacceleration by the PWN shock at the inner edge of the ejecta or alternatively time variability of the pulsar wind. The optical–NIR spectrum of the PWN is best described by a broken PL, confirming that several breaks are needed to model the full spectral energy distribution of the PWN, and suggesting the presence of more than one particle population. Finally, subtracting the PWN contribution from the pulsar spectrum we find that the spectrum is best described with a broken-PL model with a flat and a positive spectral index, in contrast to the Crab pulsar that has a negative spectral index and no break in the optical. This might imply that pulsar differences propagate to the PWN spectra.

<title>Distribution of Merging and Post-merger Galaxies in Nearby Galaxy Clusters</title>

We study the incidence and spatial distribution of galaxies that are currently undergoing gravitational merging (M) or that have signs of being post-merger (PM) in six galaxy clusters (A754, A2399, A2670, A3558, A3562, and A3716) within the redshift range of 0.05 ≲ z ≲0.08. To this aim, we obtained Dark Energy Camera mosaics in the , , and bands covering up to 3 × R200 of the clusters, reaching 28 mag arcsec−2 surface brightness limits. We visually inspect color-composite images of volume-limited (Mr < −20) cluster member galaxies to identify whether galaxies are of M or PM type. We find 4% M-type and 7% PM-type galaxies in the galaxy clusters studied. By adding spectroscopic data and studying the projected phase-space diagram (PPSD) of the projected clustocentric radius and the line-of-sight velocity, we find that PM-type galaxies are more virialized than M-type galaxies, having a 1%–5% higher fraction within the escape-velocity region, while the fraction of M-type was ∼10% higher than the PM type in the intermediate environment. Similarly, on a substructure analysis, M types were found in groups in the outskirts, while PM-type populated groups were found in ubiquitous regions of the PPSD. Adopting literature-derived dynamical state indicator values, we observed a higher abundance of M types in dynamically relaxed clusters. This finding suggests that galaxies displaying post-merger features within clusters likely merged in low-velocity environments, including clusters outskirts and dynamically relaxed clusters.

<title>Massive Debris Disks May Hinder Secular Stirring by Planetary Companions: An Analytic Proof of Concept</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad32d1</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Debris disks or exo-Kuiper belts, detected through their thermal or scattered emission from their dusty components, are ubiquitous around main-sequence stars. Since dust grains are short-lived, their sustained presence is thought to require dynamical excitation, i.e., “stirring,” of a massive reservoir of large planetesimals, such that mutual collisions are violent enough to continually supply fresh dust. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain debris disk stirring, with the commonly accepted being long-term, secular planet–debris disk interactions. However, while effective, existing planet-stirring models are rudimentary; namely, they ignore the (self-)gravity of the disk, treating it as a massless reservoir of planetesimals. Here, using a simple analytical model, we investigate the secular interactions between eccentric planets and massive, external debris disks. We demonstrate that the disk gravity drives fast apsidal precession of both planetesimal and planetary orbits, which, depending on the system parameters, may well exceed the planet-induced precession rate of planetesimals. This results in strong suppression of planetesimal eccentricities and thus relative collisional velocities throughout the disk, often by more than an order of magnitude when compared to massless disk models. We thus show that massive debris disks may hinder secular stirring by eccentric planets orbiting near, e.g., the disk’s inner edge, provided the disk is more massive than the planet. We provide simple analytic formulae to describe these effects. Finally, we show that these findings have important implications for planet inferences in debris-bearing systems, as well as for constraining the total masses of debris disks (as done for β Pic).

The computational fluid dynamics on a sphere is relevant to global simulations of geophysical fluid dynamics. Using the conventional spherical–polar (or lat–lon) grid results in a singularity at the poles, with orders-of-magnitude-smaller cell sizes at the poles in comparison to the equator. To address this problem, we developed a general circulation model (dynamic core) with a gnomonic equiangular cubed-sphere configuration. This model is developed based on the Simulating Nonhydrostatic Atmospheres on Planets model, using a finite-volume numerical scheme with a Riemann-solver-based dynamic core and the vertical implicit correction scheme. This change of the horizontal configuration gives a 20-time acceleration of global simulations compared to the lat–lon grid with a similar number of cells at medium resolution. We presented standard tests ranging from 2D shallow-water models to 3D general circulation tests, including Earth-like planets and shallow hot Jupiters, to validate the accuracy of the model. The method described in this article is generic to transform any existing finite-volume hydrodynamic model in the Cartesian geometry to the spherical geometry.

<title>Spectroscopic Observations of the Solar Corona during the 2017 August 21 Total Solar Eclipse: Comparison of Spectral Line Widths and Doppler Shifts between Open and Closed Magnetic Structures</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The spectroscopic observations presented here were acquired during the 2017 August 21 total solar eclipse (TSE) with a three-channel partially multiplexed imaging spectrometer operating at extremely high orders (>50). The 4 R⊙ extent of the slit in the north–south direction scanned the corona starting from the central meridian out to approximately 1.0 R⊙ off the east limb throughout totality. The line widths and Doppler shifts of the Fe x (637.4 nm) and Fe xiv (530.3 nm) emission lines, characteristic of 1.1 × 106 K and 1.8 × 106 K electron temperatures, respectively, varied across the different coronal structures intercepted by the slit. Fe xiv was the dominant emission in the closed fields of an active region and the base of a streamer, with relatively constant 20–30 km s−1 line widths independent of the height. In contrast, Fe x emission exhibited broader (>40 km s−1) line widths in open fields, which increased with height, in particular in the polar coronal hole. Inferences of line widths and Doppler shifts were consistent with extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations from the Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrograph, as well as with the near-infrared Fe xiii 1074 nm line observed by Coronal Multichannel Polarimeter. The differences in the spectral line widths between distinct coronal structures are interpreted as an indication of the predominance of wave heating in open structures versus localized heating in closed structures. This study underscores the unparalleled advantages and the enormous potential of TSE spectroscopy in measuring line widths simultaneously in open and closed fields at high altitudes, with minimal exposure times, stray light levels, and instrumental widths.

<title>The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS). III. A Catalog of Surface Brightness Fluctuation Distances and the Three-dimensional Distribution of Galaxies in the Virgo Cluster</title>

The surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) method is a robust and efficient way of measuring distances to galaxies containing evolved stellar populations. Although many recent applications of the method have used space-based imaging, SBF remains a powerful technique for ground-based telescopes. Deep, wide-field imaging surveys with subarcsecond seeing enable SBF measurements for numerous nearby galaxies. Using a preliminary calibration, Cantiello et al. presented SBF distances for 89 bright, mainly early-type galaxies observed in the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey. Here we present a refined calibration and SBF distances for 278 galaxies extending several magnitudes fainter than in previous work. The derived distances have uncertainties of 5%–12% depending on the properties of the individual galaxies, and our sample is more than 3 times larger than any previous SBF study of this region. Virgo has a famously complex structure with numerous subclusters, clouds, and groups; we associate individual galaxies with the various substructures and map their three-dimensional spatial distribution. Curiously, subcluster A, centered around M87, appears to have two peaks in distance: the main peak at ∼16.5 Mpc, and a smaller one at ∼19.4 Mpc. Subclusters B and C have distances of ∼15.8 Mpc. The W and W groups form a filament-like structure, extending more than 15 Mpc behind the cluster with a commensurate velocity increase of ∼1000 km s−1 along its length. These measurements are a valuable resource for future studies of the relationship between galaxy properties and local environment within a dynamic and evolving region.

There are now multiple direct probes of the region near black hole horizons, including direct imaging with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). As a result, it is now of considerable interest to identify what aspects of the underlying spacetime are constrained by these observations. For this purpose, we present a new formulation of an existing broad class of integrable, axisymmetric, stationary spinning black hole spacetimes, specified by four free radial functions, that makes manifest which functions are responsible for setting the location and morphology of the event horizon and ergosphere. We explore the size of the black hole shadow and higher-order photon rings for polar observers, approximately appropriate for the EHT observations of M87*, finding analogous expressions to those for general spherical spacetimes. Of particular interest, we find that these are independent of the properties of the ergosphere, but do directly probe the free function that defines the event horizon. Based on those expressions, we extend the nonperturbative, nonparametric characterization of the gravitational implications of various near-horizon measurements to spinning spacetimes. Finally, we demonstrate this characterization for a handful of explicit alternative spacetimes.

<title>A Narrow Uniform Core with a Wide Structured Wing: Modeling the TeV and Multiwavelength Afterglows of GRB 221009A</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The TeV afterglow of the BOAT GRB 221009A was interpreted as arising from a narrow jet, while the radio-to-X-ray afterglows were interpreted as arising from a wide structured jet. However, there is no model explaining the TeV and lower-energy multiwavelength afterglows simultaneously. We here investigate a two-component jet model, including a narrow uniform core with a wide structured wing, to explain both the multiwavelength afterglows that last up to 100 days. We find that to explain the early TeV afterglow with the inverse-Compton process, we need a circumburst density higher than ≳0.1 cm−3, while the radio afterglow and the H.E.S.S. upper limit combine to constrain the density to be lower at larger radii. Thus, a decreasing density profile with radius is favored. Considering that the rising TeV light curve during the afterglow onset favors a constant-density medium, we invoke a stratified density profile, including a constant-density profile at small radii and a wind density profile at large radii. We find that the two-component jet model with such a stratified density profile can explain the TeV, X-ray, and optical afterglows of GRB 221009A, although the radio fluxes exceed the observed ones by a factor of 2 at later epochs. The discrepancy in the radio afterglow could be resolved by invoking some nonstandard assumption about the microphysics of afterglow shocks. The total kinetic energy of the two components in our model is ≲1052 erg, significantly smaller than that in the single structured jet models.

The reappearance of supernova Refsdal with detailed modeling of the lens cluster allows us to measure the time-delay distance, which serves as a powerful tool to determine the Hubble constant (H0). We give a cosmological-model-independent method to estimate H0 through Gaussian process regression, using time-delay measurements from this lensed supernova in combination with supernova data from the Pantheon+ sample. Using eight mass models for the lens cluster, we infer , and using two cluster models most consistent with the observations, we infer . Our estimates of the value of H0 are in 1σ agreement with the results assuming a flat ΛCDM model and the uncertainties are comparable. Our constraint results on H0 from the eight lens models and the two lens models indicate 2σ and 1.8σ tensions with that estimated by Supernova H0 for the Equation of State, respectively. However, our median values of H0 from the two sets of lens models show good consistency with H0 inferred from Planck cosmic microwave background observations assuming a ΛCDM model within 1σ. We also find that our results for H0 indicate 2σ deviations and 1.7σ deviations from the constraint results of H0 using six time-delay quasars by H0LiCOW with the same analysis method.

<title>Analysis of BMR Tilt from AutoTAB Catalog: Hinting toward the Thin Flux Tube Model?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
One of the intriguing mechanisms of the Sun is the formation of bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs) in the solar convection zone (CZ), which are observed as regions of concentrated magnetic fields of opposite polarity on the photosphere. These BMRs are tilted with respect to the equatorial line, which statistically increases with latitude. The thin flux tube model, employing the rise of magnetically buoyant flux loops and their twist by Coriolis force, is a popular paradigm for explaining the formation of tilted BMRs. In this study, we assess the validity of the thin flux tube model by analyzing the tracked BMR data obtained through the Automatic Tracking Algorithm for BMRs. Our observations reveal that the tracked BMRs exhibit the expected collective behaviors. We find that the polarity separation of BMRs increases over their normalized lifetime, supporting the assumption of a rising flux tube from the CZ. Moreover, we observe an increasing trend of the tilt with the flux of the BMR, suggesting that rising flux tubes associated with lower flux regions are primarily influenced by drag force and Coriolis force, while in higher flux regions, magnetic buoyancy dominates. Furthermore, we observe Joy’s law dependence for emerging BMRs from their first detection, indicating that at least a portion of the tilt observed in BMRs can be attributed to the Coriolis force. Notably, lower flux regions exhibit a higher amount of fluctuations associated with their tilt measurement compared to stronger flux regions, suggesting that lower flux regions are more susceptible to turbulent convection.

<div> 密度波，螺旋结构，剪切波，螺旋增强，银河系

总结:
本文将螺旋结构的两种类型整合为一个统一的描述，包括了密度波在紧密螺旋极限之外的剪切和非稳定开放螺旋的情况。这一剪切波场景新颖地捕捉到了螺旋增强，使得结构形成超过了传统的Q阈值。然而，它也突出了对螺旋作用在增幅过程中的基本作用，不论波是剪切的还是不剪切的。因此，它通过Lynden-Bell＆Kalnajs所描述的驴效应捕捉了共振和非共振模式的增长，关键是当驴行为不再被允许时增长的停止。我们的计算预测，仅在Jeans长度之上，后螺旋结构会增长，螺旋结构的突出特性是其跨越一系列取向，随着臂的重复次数的减少而增加，以及增长最快的临界方向对于两种模式和物质模式相同。预测的结构与高度规则，高重复次数的气体跨度特征和螺旋和条状体上间距接近Jeans尺度的长丝相一致。应用于恒星盘时，条件有利于低重复次数（m < 5）的开放后螺旋，其螺距角在观测范围10° < ip < 50°内。这项工作的结果作为描述螺旋的一个统一的瞬态波类的基础，丰富刺激，但根据当地条件进行增长的严格选择。 <div>
Theories of spiral structure traditionally separate into tight-winding Lin–Shu spiral density waves and the swing-amplified material patterns of Goldreich & Lynden-Bell and Julian & Toomre. In this paper we consolidate these two types of spirals into a unified description, treating density waves beyond the tight-winding limit, in the regime of shearing and nonsteady open spirals. This shearing wave scenario novelly captures swing amplification that enables structure formation above conventional Q thresholds. However, it also highlights the fundamental role of spiral forcing on the amplification process in general, whether the wave is shearing or not. Thus it captures resonant and nonresonant mode growth through the donkey effect described by Lynden-Bell & Kalnajs and, critically, the cessation of growth when donkey behavior is no longer permitted. Our calculations predict growth exclusive to trailing spirals above the Jeans length, the prominence of spirals across a range of orientations that increases with decreasing arm multiplicity, and a critical orientation where growth is fastest that is the same for both modes and material patterns. Predicted structures are consistent with highly regular, high-multiplicity gaseous spur features and long filaments spaced close to the Jeans scale in spirals and bars. Applied to stellar disks, conditions favor low multiplicity (m < 5) open trailing spirals with pitch angles in the observed range 10° < ip < 50°. The results of this work serve as a basis for describing spirals as a unified class of transient waves, abundantly stimulated but narrowly selected for growth depending on local conditions.

<div> 关键词: 红外暗云、磁场、星云、引力、湍流
总结: 
红外暗云G28.34的磁场与星云尺度的关系复杂，大尺度上磁场对引力有一定抵抗作用，但在小尺度上会被星云的引力扭曲，并受恒星形成活动的影响。通过多种分析方法，发现G28.34处于次阿尔文环境，磁场有效地阻止了大尺度弥散气体的引力坍缩，但在星云内部受引力影响，且受恒星形成活动的影响。考虑了热、磁、湍流支撑后发现，G28.34环境气体处于超维里状态，红外暗云可能处于接近平衡状态，而核心MM4-core4则处于次维里状态。综上所述，磁场在大尺度上主导了云的形成和演化过程，导致云的形成和演化过程相对缓慢。在云内部，引力可能克服了磁场和湍流的作用，促使局部动力学恒星形成的发生。 <div>
We have comprehensively studied the multiscale physical properties of the massive infrared dark cloud G28.34 (the Dragon cloud) with dust polarization and molecular line data from Planck, FCRAO-14 m, James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We find that the averaged magnetic fields of clumps tend to be either parallel with or perpendicular to the cloud-scale magnetic fields, while the cores in clump MM4 tend to have magnetic fields aligned with the clump fields. Implementing the relative orientation analysis (for magnetic fields, column density gradients, and local gravity), velocity gradient technique, and modified Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi analysis, we find that G28.34 is located in a trans-to-sub-Alfvénic environment; the magnetic field is effectively resisting gravitational collapse in large-scale diffuse gas, but is distorted by gravity within the cloud and affected by star formation activities in high-density regions, and the normalized mass-to-flux ratio tends to increase with increasing density and decreasing radius. Considering the thermal, magnetic, and turbulent supports, we find that the environmental gas of G28.34 is in a supervirial (supported) state, the infrared dark clumps may be in a near-equilibrium state, and core MM4-core4 is in a subvirial (gravity-dominant) state. In summary, we suggest that magnetic fields dominate gravity and turbulence in the cloud environment at large scales, resulting in relatively slow cloud formation and evolution processes. Within the cloud, gravity could overwhelm both magnetic fields and turbulence, allowing local dynamical star formation to happen.

研究使用Atacama大型毫米/亚毫米阵列对V883 Ori进行无偏光谱调查。检测到的分子发射线揭示了Keplerian盘和向内坠落包络的形态/运动学特征。在CO、HCO+、HCN、HNC和H2CO中检测到了直接向内坠落的特征，即红移吸收。HCO+和SO显示大型类似臂的结构，可能连接向内坠落的包络和盘。HCN和H2CO显示内外盘之间的明显边界和可能的螺旋结构，连接外盘和内盘。HNC显示一个由于高温下其化学转变为HCN而产生的大型中心发射空洞（r∼0.″3）。检测到了HDO发射，这是水升华区域的直接追踪者。复杂有机分子的分子发射受限于HDO发射边界，HCO+在其分布中有一个发射空洞，这是由于其被水分解造成的。所有这些特征表明V883 Ori当前的喷发可能是由从包络向外盘的向内坠落触发的，从而产生一股向内传播的螺旋波，极大地增强了对中心恒星的吸积。<br /><br />总结: 该研究使用阿塔卡马大型毫米/亚毫米阵列对V883 Ori进行了光谱调查。观测到了从分子中心向外向内坠落的特征，还发现了大量分子发射和向内坠落包络与盘的连接结构。研究结果揭示了星风活动、爆发事件的触发机制，并有助于了解这一年轻恒星的形成和发展过程。 <div>
An unbiased spectral survey of V883 Ori, an eruptive young star, was carried out with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Band 6. The detected line emission from various molecules reveals morphological/kinematical features in both the Keplerian disk and the infalling envelope. A direct infall signature, redshifted absorption against the continuum, has been detected in CO, HCO+, HCN, HNC, and H2CO. HCO+ and SO show large armlike structures that probably connect the infalling envelope to the disk. HCN and H2CO reveal a distinct boundary between the inner and outer disks and tentative spiral structures connecting the outer disk to the inner disk. HNC shows a large central emission hole (r ∼ 0.″3) due to its chemical conversion to HCN at high temperatures. HDO emission, a direct tracer of the water sublimation region, has been detected in the disk. Molecular emission from complex organic molecules is confined within the HDO emission boundary, and HCO+ has an emission hole in its distribution due to its destruction by water. Together, these features suggest that the current episode of eruption in V883 Ori may be triggered by the infall from the envelope to the outer disk, generating a spiral wave that propagates inward and greatly enhances the accretion onto the central star.

<title>Discovery of an Accretion Streamer and a Slow Wide-angle Outflow around FU Orionis</title>

<div> FU Orionis, ALMA, accretion streamer, outflow, kinematic modeling

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了对FU Orionis爆发系统的观测结果，使用了ALMA的12m、7m和全功率阵列观测数据，涵盖了160到25,000天文单位的空间尺度。高分辨率的干涉数据揭示了一个纵向的12CO(2–1)特征，这个特征被认为是一个进食串流，供给了双星系统。观测到的串流质量流速远低于典型的恒星吸积速率，提示这个串流本身不足以维持典型的爆发类型的增强吸积速率。此外，文章还观测到一个巨大的、缓慢移动的二氧化碳分子流，这个分子流被认为是不与当前的爆发有关的被扫描材料，类似于其他FUor和I类原恒星物体周围观测到的缓慢分子流。 <div>
We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array 12-m, 7-m, and Total Power Array observations of the FU Orionis outbursting system, covering spatial scales ranging from 160 to 25,000 au. The high-resolution interferometric data reveal an elongated 12CO(2–1) feature previously observed at lower resolution in 12CO(3–2). Kinematic modeling indicates that this feature can be interpreted as an accretion streamer feeding the binary system. The mass infall rate provided by the streamer is significantly lower than the typical stellar accretion rates (even in quiescent states), suggesting that this streamer alone is not massive enough to sustain the enhanced accretion rates characteristic of the outbursting class prototype. The observed streamer may not be directly linked to the current outburst, but rather a remnant of a previous, more massive streamer that may have contributed enough to the disk mass to render it unstable and trigger the FU Orionis outburst. The new data detect, for the first time, a vast, slow-moving carbon monoxide molecular outflow emerging from this object. To accurately assess the outflow properties (mass, momentum, and kinetic energy), we employ 13CO(2–1) data to correct for optical depth effects. The analysis indicates that the outflow corresponds to swept-up material not associated with the current outburst, similar to the slow molecular outflows observed around other FUor and Class I protostellar objects.

<div> 关键词: ICMEs, 磁场, 太阳风, ME, 太阳探测器<br />
<br />总结: 通过对ICMEs的统计调查，研究者们发现了一些有趣的结果。首先，他们发现靠近太阳处更容易观测到相干的ICME配置，而在较远处更容易观测到更复杂的配置。其次，他们通过多元鲁棒回归推导出了1 au内磁性喷射物（ME）的扩展速率比先前的统计估计要慢。此外，他们还发现ICME鞘内的磁场波动与日风到ME的相对磁场强度梯度强烈耦合。第三，他们认为ME的扩展是鞘形成中的一个重要因素。最后，他们确定了畸变参数（DiP），发现ME的整体不对称性较低，而且即使对于扩展的ME，样本ME的持续时间与DiP值没有相关性，表明老化效应不是观察到的ME不对称性的唯一贡献因素。 <div>
We present a statistical investigation of the radial evolution of 28 interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs), measured in situ by the Parker Solar Probe spacecraft from 2018 October to 2022 August. First, by analyzing the radial distribution of ICME classification based on magnetic hodograms, we find that coherent configurations are more likely to be observed close to the Sun. By contrast, more complex configurations are observed farther out. We also notice that the post-ICME magnetic field is more impacted following an ICME passage at larger heliocentric distances. Second, with a multilinear robust regression, we derive a slower magnetic ejecta (ME) expansion rate within 1 au compared to previous statistical estimates. Then, investigating the magnetic field fluctuations within ICME sheaths, we see that these fluctuations are strongly coupled to the relative magnetic field strength gradient from the upstream solar wind to the ME. Third, we identify ME expansion as an important factor in the formation of sheaths. Finally, we determine the distortion parameter (DiP), which is a measure of magnetic field asymmetry in an ME. We discover lower overall asymmetries within MEs. We reveal that even for expanding MEs, the time duration over which an ME is sampled does not correlate with DiP values, indicating that the aging effect is not the sole contributor to the observed ME asymmetries.

总结: <br /><br />研究目的是通过比较观测系统和理论模型的预测结果来测试大质量恒星形成的理论模型。通过进行CO分子线辐射传递后处理来生成不同转变的12CO、13CO和C18O发射的合成位置-位置-速度立方体。对这些辐射进行模拟ALMA观测，并对从分子线中得到的质量、动量和动能估计与真实值进行比较。结果发现质量和动量的估计可能有高达4倍的不确定性，而动能估计更为低估。此外，还对合成光谱中得到的质量和动量流出速率与真实值进行比较。最后，将合成光谱与ALMA观测到的原恒星进行比较，并计算质量和动量流出速率，发现两者与理论恒星演化轨迹相吻合。 <div>
To test theoretical models of massive star formation it is important to compare their predictions with observed systems. To this end, we conduct CO molecular line radiative transfer post-processing of 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of various stages in the evolutionary sequence of a massive protostellar core, including its infall envelope and disk wind outflow. Synthetic position–position–velocity cubes of various transitions of 12CO, 13CO, and C18O emission are generated. We also carry out simulated Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of this emission. We compare the mass, momentum, and kinetic energy estimates obtained from molecular lines to the true values, finding that the mass and momentum estimates can have uncertainties of up to a factor of 4. However, the kinetic energy estimated from molecular lines is more significantly underestimated. Additionally, we compare the mass outflow rate and momentum outflow rate obtained from the synthetic spectra with the true values. Finally, we compare the synthetic spectra with real examples of ALMA-observed protostars and determine the best-fitting protostellar masses and outflow inclination angles. We then calculate the mass outflow rate and momentum outflow rate for these sources, finding that both rates agree with theoretical protostellar evolutionary tracks.

总结:<br /><br />本研究以NGC 3982为案例，使用五种唯一的遮挡模型拟合了相同的XMM-Newton+NuSTAR光谱，并为每个模型生成了参数后验分布。穿越完整的先验定义的参数空间，准确再现了复杂的后验形状和参数之间的相互关联。各模型对于视线方向的柱密度的后验分布基本一致，预测的Compton厚NH > 1.5 × 1024 cm−2在3σ置信水平上。然而，每个模型对于内在X射线光度的后验分布差异较大，分别在log L2–10 keV/ erg s−1 = 40.9–42.1的范围内。此外，我们还展示了各模型的后验分布在各自多维参数空间中占据其独特区域，这种差异可能会传播到中心引擎的推断属性中。最后，展示了高能X射线探测器在参数推断方面的改进。 <div>
X-ray spectroscopy of heavily obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) offers a unique opportunity to study the circumnuclear environment of accreting supermassive black holes. However, individual models describing the obscurer have unique parameter spaces that give distinct parameter posterior distributions when fit to the same data. To assess the impact of model-specific parameter dependencies, we present a case study of the nearby heavily obscured low-luminosity AGN NGC 3982, which has a variety of column density estimations reported in the literature. We fit the same broadband XMM-Newton+NuSTAR spectra of the source with five unique obscuration models and generate posterior parameter distributions for each. By using global parameter exploration, we traverse the full prior-defined parameter space to accurately reproduce complex posterior shapes and inter-parameter degeneracies. The unique model posteriors for the line-of-sight column density are broadly consistent, predicting Compton-thick NH > 1.5 × 1024 cm−2 at the 3σ confidence level. The posterior median intrinsic X-ray luminosity in the 2–10 keV band was found to differ substantially, however, with values in the range log L2–10 keV/ erg s−1 = 40.9–42.1 for the individual models. We additionally show that the posterior distributions for each model occupy unique regions of their respective multidimensional parameter spaces and how such differences can propagate into the inferred properties of the central engine. We conclude by showcasing the improvement in parameter inference attainable with the High Energy X-ray Probe, with its uniquely broad, simultaneous, and high-sensitivity bandpass of 0.2–80 keV.

<div> FAST, FRB, spectral peak frequency, intrinsic burst energies, Monte Carlo simulation analysis
总结: 本文研究了快速无线电爆发（FRBs）的辐射物理，发现FRB 20201124A的窄带爆发在0.4–2 GHz活跃，并且其光谱峰频率主要集中在约1 GHz。通过FAST探测到的1268次FRB 20201124A爆发，研究表明约71.4%的事件的1σ光谱范围在FAST频段内。通过高斯函数拟合光谱曲线，很好地测量了固有爆发能量和光谱宽度。蒙特卡洛模拟分析推断了其固有峰频率分布和固有能量函数，并将结果与典型的重复FRB 20121102A和20190520B进行了比较。作者认为FRB 20201124A可能发生在一个精密调谐的等离子体中，这种等离子体能够产生窄频段的激射辐射，而FRB 20121102A和FRB 20190520B可能涉及多团块的等离子体条件，在广泛范围内产生几个特定频率的激射辐射。 <div>
The radiation physics of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains an open question. Current observations have discovered that narrowly banded bursts of FRB 20201124A are active in 0.4–2 GHz, and their spectral peak frequency ( ) is mostly toward ∼1 GHz. Utilizing a sample of 1268 bursts of FRB 20201124A detected with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we show that the 1σ spectral regime of 71.4% of the events (in-band bursts) is within the FAST bandpass. The intrinsic burst energies ( ) and spectral widths ( ) are well measured by fitting the spectral profile with a Gaussian function. The derived and distributions are lognormal and centered at and . Our Monte Carlo simulation analysis infers its intrinsic νp distribution as a normal function centered at νp,c = 1.16 GHz (σ = 0.22) and its intrinsic energy function as with Ec = 9.49 × 1037 erg. We compare these results with that of typical repeating FRBs 20121102A and 20190520B, which are active over a broad frequency range at several specific frequencies, and discuss possible observational biases on the estimation of the event rate and energy function. Based on these results, we argue that FRB 20201124A likely occurs in a fine-tuned plasma for maser radiation at a narrow frequency range, while FRB 20121102A and FRB 20190520B could involve clumpy plasma conditions that make maser emission around several specific frequencies in a broad range.

<div> TeV photons, gamma-ray bursts, Klein–Nishina effect, extragalactic background light, axion-like particles

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了GRB 221009A对目前我们对产生TeV光子的机制的理解提出的重大挑战。作者提出了大量的想法和假设，包括逆康普顿散射的Klein-Nishina效应导致高能电子的能量损失不够有效，以及外星际背景光的吸收效应等。他们还研究了TeV光子转化为轴子样粒子(ALPs)的可能性，并进行了参数空间的研究。此外，作者还考虑了EBL模型的不同假设，并给出了ALPs候选者的质量范围。这篇文章提出了一种探讨GRB中TeV光子产生机制的新思路，为相关研究领域提供了有益的信息。 <div>
GRB 221009A has posed a significant challenge to our current understanding of the mechanisms that produce TeV photons in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). On one hand, the Klein–Nishina (KN) effect of the inverse Compton scattering leads to less efficient energy losses of high-energy electrons. On the other hand, at a redshift of 0.151, the TeV spectrum of GRB 221009A undergoes significant absorption by the extragalactic background light (EBL). Therefore, the observation of a 13 TeV photon in this event implies the presence of enormous photon fluxes at the source, which the synchrotron self-Compton mechanism in external shocks cannot easily generate. As an alternative, some authors have suggested the possibility of converting the TeV photons into axion-like particles (ALPs) at the host galaxy, in order to avoid the effects of EBL absorption, and then reconverting them into photons within the Milky Way. While this solution relaxes the requirement of very high photon fluxes, the KN effect still poses a challenge. Previously, we have shown that the injections of ALPs could explain the observation of 13 TeV photons. Here, we include the energy dependence of the probability of survival and the amount of energy carried to determine the ALP candidates, which could potentially explain the TeV photons observed by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory and their hard spectrum. We found that the allowed candidates are generally clustered around masses of 10−7 eV. We also considered different EBL models, for the one predicting larger attenuation tends to reject ALP candidates with the lowest coupling factor. For some hypotheses of the EBL model, these candidates are found below a region of the parameter space in which, if detected, ALPs could account for all of the cold dark matter in the Universe.

研究利用HR5模拟预测了在宇宙的早期（10≳z≳4）星系的盘状形态在ΛCDM宇宙中占主导地位，这种形态是由物质初始波动中的潮汐力所驱动的。通过在公开发布的领域中利用深度JWST/NIRCam图像，识别了约19,000个JWST星系，并对其进行了对比观测，结果表明在各个红移范围下盘状星系占比60%-70%，但在高质量星系中，球状形态成为主导类型。这意味着星系的质量增长伴随着从盘状到球状的形态过渡。总体而言，星系的形态分布与HR5模拟得出的结果高度一致。这些结果进一步证实了在宇宙早期和正午时盘状星系占主导地位。 <br /><br />总结: <br />红移、宇宙早期、星系形态、JWST望远镜、HR5模拟。 <div>
A recent study from the Horizon Run 5 (HR5) cosmological simulation has predicted that galaxies with in the cosmic morning (10 ≳ z ≳ 4) dominantly have disk-like morphology in the ΛCDM universe, which is driven by the tidal torque in the initial fluctuations of matter. For a direct comparison with observation we identify a total of about 19,000 James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) galaxies with at z = 0.6–8.0 utilizing deep JWST/NIRCam images of publicly released fields, including North Ecliptic Pole Time-Domain Fields, Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public survey, Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey, Cosmic Evolution Survey, UltraDeep Survey, and SMACS J0723-7327. We estimate their stellar masses and photometric redshifts with the redshift dispersion of σNMAD = 0.009 and an outlier fraction of only about 6%. We classify galaxies into three morphological types, disks,spheroids, and irregulars, applying the same criteria used in the HR5 study. The morphological distribution of the JWST galaxies shows that disk galaxies account for 60%–70% at all redshift ranges. However, in the high-mass regime ( ), spheroidal morphology becomes the dominant type. This implies that the mass growth of galaxies is accompanied by a morphological transition from disks to spheroids. The fraction of irregulars is about 20% or less at all masses and redshifts. All the trends in the morphology distribution are consistently found in the six JWST fields. These results are in close agreement with the results from the HR5 simulation, particularly confirming the prevalence of disk galaxies at small masses in the cosmic morning and noon.

<div> He ii absorption, reemission, UVB, cosmological simulations, reionization
<br /><br />总结:
本研究通过在宇宙学模拟中实施He ii吸收和再发射处理，研究其对三维宇宙超紫外背景（UVB）的影响。通过比较具有和没有He ii再处理的模拟，我们发现在He ii Lyman系列共振发生的3.5到4Ryd区间内，UVB平均值在z=10-5之间减弱了约3 dex。在过密区域，整体UVB幅度较高，He ii再处理的影响较小，表明在星系附近He ii再电离的早期开始。将我们的模拟与两种流行的一维UV模型进行比较，发现在z = 5时，能量高达3Ryd以上时，我们的模拟显示出更大的He ii吸收。H i和He ii再电离历史几乎不受He ii再处理的影响，尽管宇宙星系形成率密度受到了高达4%的改变。当考虑He ii时，C iv的宇宙质量密度减少了约2 dex，而Si iv、C ii、Mg ii、Si ii和O i则没有受到影响。 <div>
We implement a treatment of helium ii absorption and reemission into the Technicolor Dawn cosmological simulations to study its impact on the metagalactic ultraviolet background (UVB) in three dimensions. By comparing simulations with and without He ii reprocessing, we show that it weakens the mean UVB by ∼3 dex from z = 10–5 between 3.5 and 4 Ryd, where the He ii Lyman series resonance occurs. In overdense regions, the overall UVB amplitude is higher, and the impact of He ii reprocessing is weaker, qualitatively indicating an early start to He ii reionization near galaxies. Comparing our simulations to two popular one-dimensional UV models, we find good agreement up to 3 Ryd at z = 5. At higher energies, our simulation shows significantly greater He ii absorption because it accounts for He ii arising both in diffuse regions and in Lyman limit systems. By contrast, the comparison models account only for He ii in Lyman limit systems, which are subdominant prior to the completion of He ii reionization. The H i and He ii reionization histories are nearly unaffected by He ii reprocessing, although the cosmic star formation rate density is altered by up to 4%. The cosmic mass density of C iv is reduced by ∼2 dex when He ii is accounted for, while Si iv, C ii, Mg ii, Si ii, and O i are unaffected.

<title>Morphology and Kinematics of the Gas in M51: How Interaction with NGC 5195 Has Molded the Structure of Its Arms</title>

The Whirlpool Galaxy is a well-studied grand design galaxy with two major spiral arms, and a large satellite NGC 5195. The arms both show long uniform sections with perturbations (“kinks” or sharp turns) in specific regions. Comparing the two arms shows a small radial offset between the main kinked regions. We analyzed the morphology and also the velocity field in the disk of M51 using kinematic maps based on Hα and CO line emission. These sample complementary radial ranges, with the CO map covering the central zone and the Hα map extending to cover the outer zone. We looked for indicators of density wave resonance, zones where radial flows of gas in the disk plane reverse their sign. These were present in both velocity maps; their 2D localization placed them along or closely parallel to the spiral arms, at a set of well-defined galactocentric radii, and notably more concentrated along the southern, stronger arm. The results can be well interpreted quantitatively, using a numerical model of the interaction of M51 and NGC 5195 in which the satellite has made two relatively recent passes through the disk plane of M51. During the first pass the pair of dominant spiral arms was stimulated, and during the second pass the strong kinks in both arms were formed at about the same time. The second interaction is particularly well characterized, because the timescale corresponding to the production of the kinks and the recovery of the original pitch angle is identical for the two arms.

The presence of a large amount of Li in giants is still a mystery. Most of the super Li-rich (SLR) giants reported in recent studies are in the solar metallicity regime. Here, we study the five metal-poor SLRs from the Galactic Archeology with HERMES Data Release 3, with their [Fe/H] ranging from −1.35 to −2.38 with lithium abundance of A(Li) ≥ 3.4 dex. The asteroseismic analysis reveals that none are on the red giant branch. The average period spacing (ΔP ) values indicate giants are in the core He-burning phase. All of them are low-mass giants (M < 1.5 M⊙). Their location in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram suggests one of them is in the red clump (RC) phase, and interestingly, the other four are much brighter and coincide with the early asymptotic giant branch phase. The analysis of the abundance reveals that C, O, Na, Ba, and Eu are normal in giants of respective metallicities and evolutionary phases. Further, we did not find any strong evidence of the presence of dust in the form of infrared excess or binarity from the available radial velocity data. We discuss a few scenarios for the existence of SLRs at higher luminosity, including past merger events. Our findings will help in understanding the production and evolution of Li among giants, in particular, during the RC phase and the post-RC phase.

The third data release (DR3) of Gaia has provided a fivefold increase in the number of radial velocity measurements of stars, as well as a stark improvement in parallax and proper motion measurements. To help with studies that seek to test models and interpret Gaia DR3, we present nine Gaia synthetic surveys, based on three solar positions in three Milky Way-mass galaxies of the Latte suite of the Fire-2 cosmological simulations. These synthetic surveys match the selection function, radial velocity measurements, and photometry of Gaia DR3, adapting the code base Ananke, previously used to match the Gaia DR2 release by Sanderson et al. The synthetic surveys are publicly available and can be found at http://ananke.hub.yt/. Similarly to the previous release of Ananke, these surveys are based on cosmological simulations and thus are able to model nonequilibrium dynamical effects, making them a useful tool in testing and interpreting Gaia DR3.

Gravitational waves (GWs) can be deflected, similarly to electromagnetic (EM) waves, by massive objects through the phenomenon of gravitational lensing. The importance of GW lensing for GW astronomy is becoming increasingly apparent in the GW detection era, in which nearly 100 events have already been detected. As current ground-based interferometers reach their design sensitivities, it is anticipated that these detectors may observe a few GW signals that are strongly lensed by the dark halos of intervening galaxies or galaxy clusters. Analyzing the strong lensing effects on GW signals is, thus, becoming important to understand the lens’ properties and correctly infer the intrinsic GW source parameters. However, one cannot accurately infer lens parameters for complex lens models with only GW observations because there are strong degeneracies between the parameters of lensed waveforms. In this paper, we discuss how to conduct parameter estimation of strongly lensed GW signals and infer the lens parameters using additional EM information, including the lens galaxy’s axis ratio and the GW source-hosting galaxy’s lensed images. We find that for simple spherically symmetric lens models, the lens parameters can be well recovered using only GW information. On the other hand, recovering the lens parameters requires systems in which four or more GW images are detected with additional EM observations for nonaxially symmetric lens models. Combinations of GW and EM observations can further improve the inference of the lens parameters.

<title>Empirical Models of the Hβ Broad Emission Line Gas Density Field</title>

We present the second iteration of the caramel-gas code, an empirical model of the broad-line region (BLR) gas density field. Building on the initial development and testing of caramel-gas, we expand the meaning of the model parameter α, which initially represented only the power-law index of the dependency of emissivity on radial distance. In this work, we test a more generalized radial power-law index, α, that also includes a description of the effective emitting size(s) of the BLR structure as a function of radial distance. We select a sample of 10 active galactic nuclei (AGN) from three different Lick AGN Monitoring Project campaigns to further validate the caramel-gas code and test the generalized radial power-law index, α. Our results confirm that the caramel-gas results are in general agreement with the published results determined using the original caramel code, further demonstrating that our forward modeling method is robust. We find that a positive radial power-law index is generally favored and propose three possible scenarios: (i) the BLR structure has increasing effective emitting size(s) at larger radial distances from the central source, (ii) emission is concentrated at the outer edges of the BLR, and (iii) stronger theoretical assumptions are needed to break the degeneracies inherent to the interpretation of reverberation mapping data in terms of underlying gas properties.

<title>Comparing Recent Pulsar Timing Array Results on the Nanohertz Stochastic Gravitational-wave Background</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Australian, Chinese, European, Indian, and North American pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations recently reported, at varying levels, evidence for the presence of a nanohertz gravitational-wave background (GWB). Given that each PTA made different choices in modeling their data, we perform a comparison of the GWB and individual pulsar noise parameters across the results reported from the PTAs that constitute the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA). We show that despite making different modeling choices, there is no significant difference in the GWB parameters that are measured by the different PTAs, agreeing within 1σ. The pulsar noise parameters are also consistent between different PTAs for the majority of the pulsars included in these analyses. We bridge the differences in modeling choices by adopting a standardized noise model for all pulsars and PTAs, finding that under this model there is a reduction in the tension in the pulsar noise parameters. As part of this reanalysis, we “extended” each PTA’s data set by adding extra pulsars that were not timed by that PTA. Under these extensions, we find better constraints on the GWB amplitude and a higher signal-to-noise ratio for the Hellings–Downs correlations. These extensions serve as a prelude to the benefits offered by a full combination of data across all pulsars in the IPTA, i.e., the IPTA’s Data Release 3, which will involve not just adding in additional pulsars but also including data from all three PTAs where any given pulsar is timed by more than a single PTA.

<title>NuSTAR Observations of Candidate Subparsec Binary Supermassive Black Holes</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad372e</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present an analysis of NuSTAR X-ray observations of three active galactic nuclei (AGN) that were identified as candidate subparsec binary supermassive black hole (SMBH) systems in the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey based on apparent periodicity in their optical light curves. Simulations predict that close-separation accreting SMBH binaries will have different X-ray spectra than single accreting SMBHs. We previously observed these AGN with Chandra and found no differences between their low-energy X-ray properties and the larger AGN population. However, some models predict differences to be more prominent at energies higher than probed by Chandra. We find that even at the higher energies probed by NuSTAR, the spectra of these AGN are indistinguishable from the larger AGN population. This could rule out models predicting large differences in the X-ray spectra in the NuSTAR bands. Alternatively, it might mean that these three AGN are not binary SMBHs.

<title>Morphology and Mach Number Dependence of Subsonic Bondi–Hoyle Accretion</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We carry out three-dimensional computations of the accretion rate onto an object (of size Rsink and mass m) as it moves through a uniform medium at a subsonic speed v∞. The object is treated as a fully absorbing boundary (e.g., a black hole). In contrast to early conjectures, we show that for an accretor with in a gaseous medium with adiabatic index γ = 5/3, the accretion rate is independent of Mach number and is determined only by m and the gas entropy. Our numerical simulations are conducted using two different numerical schemes via the Athena++ and Arepo hydrodynamics solvers, which reach nearly identical steady-state solutions. We find that pressure gradients generated by the isentropic compression of the flow near the accretor are sufficient to suspend much of the surrounding gas in a near-hydrostatic equilibrium, just as predicted from the spherical Bondi–Hoyle calculation. Indeed, the accretion rates for steady flow match the Bondi–Hoyle rate, and are indicative of isentropic flow for subsonic motion where no shocks occur. We also find that the accretion drag may be predicted using the Safronov number, Θ = RA/Rsink, and is much less than the dynamical friction for sufficiently small accretors (Rsink ≪ RA).

<title>The Temperature and Density of a Solar Flare Kernel Measured from Extreme-ultraviolet Lines of O iv</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Previously unexplored diagnostics of O iv in the extreme-ultraviolet region 260–280 Å are used to derive a temperature and density for a solar flare kernel observed on 2012 March 9 with the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer on the Hinode satellite. Seven lines from the 2s2p2–2s2p3s transition array between 271.99 and 272.31 Å are both temperature- and density-sensitive relative to the line at 279.93 Å. The temperature, T, is constrained with the λ268.02/λ279.93 ratio, giving a value of . The ratio λ272.13/λ279.93 then yields an electron number density, Ne, of with a lower limit of 11.90 and an upper limit of 14.40. The O iv emitting volume is estimated to be 0.″4 (300 km) across. Additional O iv lines at 196, 207, and 260 Å are consistent with the derived temperature and density but have larger uncertainties from the radiometric calibration and blending. Density diagnostics of O v and Mg vii from the same spectrum are consistent with a constant pressure of 1017.0 K cm−3 through the transition region. The temperature derived from O iv supports recent results that O iv is formed around 0.10 dex lower at high densities compared to standard zero-density ionization balance calculations.

<title>Contribution of Neutrino-dominated Accretion Flows to the Cosmic MeV Neutrino Background</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs) are one of the important MeV neutrino sources and significantly contribute to the cosmic diffuse neutrino background. In this paper, we investigate the spectrum of the diffuse NDAF neutrino background (DNNB) by fully considering the effects of the progenitor properties and initial explosion energies based on core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations, and estimate the detectable event rate by the Super-Kamiokande detector. We find that the predicted background neutrino flux is mainly determined by the typical CCSN initial explosion energy and progenitor metallicity. For the optimistic cases, in which the typical initial explosion energy is low, the diffuse flux of the DNNB is comparable to the diffuse supernova neutrino background, which might be detected by upcoming larger neutrino detectors, such as Hyper-Kamiokande, the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory, and the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment. Moreover, the strong outflows from NDAFs could dramatically decrease their contribution to the neutrino background.

<title>Galaxy Spin Transition Driven by the Misalignments between the Protogalaxy Inertia and Initial Tidal Tensors</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A numerical detection of the τ-driven transition of galaxy spins is presented, where τ is the degree of misalignment between the initial tidal field and protogalaxy inertia tensors. Analyzing the data from the IllustrisTNG300-1 simulations, we first measure the values of τ at the protogalactic sites found by tracing the constituents of the galactic halos in the mass range of back to the initial stage, zi = 127. The probability density functions of τ are shown to be well modeled by the Γ-distributions, whose shape and scale parameters turn out to have universal values on a certain critical scale. Then, we investigate how the strength and tendency of the galaxy spin alignments with the principal axes of the local tidal fields depend on the initial condition, τ. It is found that on a scale lower than the critical one, the galaxy spin transition occurs at two different thresholds from the major to intermediate and from the intermediate to minor principal axes of the local tidal fields, respectively. Noting that the τ-dependent spin transition supersedes the strength of the previously found mass-dependent, morphology-dependent, and radius-dependent counterparts, we suggest that τ should be the key driver of all types of galaxy spin transitions and that the present galaxy spins are indeed excellent fossil records of their origin.

<title>A Study of Particle Acceleration in Blazar Jets</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad38bd</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The particle acceleration of blazar jets is crucial to high-energy astrophysics, yet the acceleration mechanism division in blazar subclasses and the underlying nature of these mechanisms remain elusive. In this work, we utilized the synchrotron spectral information (synchrotron peak frequency, , and corresponding curvature, bsy) of 2705 blazars from the literature and studied the subject of particle acceleration in blazar jets by analyzing the correlation between and 1/bsy. Our results suggested that the entire sample follows an energy-dependent probability acceleration (EDPA). Specifically, the low inverse Compton peak sources (LCPs) follow the mechanism of fluctuations of fractional gain acceleration (FFGA), while the high inverse Compton peak sources (HCPs) follow an acceleration mechanism of EDPA. Our results indicated that the separation between LCPs and HCPs results from the electron peak Lorentz factor (γp), and the differentiation should originate from different acceleration mechanisms. Moreover, our study revealed a transition in the acceleration mechanism from FFGA to EDPA around through a detailed analysis of binned- . The mechanism of FFGA dominates the particle acceleration in LCP jets because of stronger jets and the EDPA dominates the particle energy gain in the HCPs due to a more efficient acceleration process.

<title>Scattering Cross Sections of Magnetized Particles within Intense Electromagnetic Waves: Application to Fast Radio Bursts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recently, Beloborodov suggested that there exists a resonance phenomenon between an extremely intense electromagnetic wave and internal magnetized particles. The particles exchange energy with the wave at frequent resonance events and then reach the radiation reaction limit immediately. This process greatly enhances the scattering cross section of the particles. Note that these results only involve an extraordinary (X) mode wave. In this paper, we focus on an intense ordinary (O) mode wave propagating through magnetized particles and compare it with the case of the X-mode wave. Our result shows that the scattering cross section of the particles in the O-mode wave is significantly smaller than that in the X-mode wave. This has important implications for the transparency of a fast radio burst (FRB) inside the magnetosphere of a magnetar. We argue that there is a strong scattering region in the stellar magnetosphere, within which an O-mode wave is more transparent than an X-mode wave for an FRB.

<title>Bulk Properties of PSR J0030+0451 Inferred with the Compactness Measurement of NICER</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In 2019, the Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER) mission released its findings on the mass and radius of the isolated neutron star (INS) PSR J0030+0451, revealing a mass of approximately 1.4 solar masses (M⊙) and a radius near 13 km. However, the recent reanalysis by the NICER collaboration suggests that the available data primarily yield a precise inference of the compactness for this source while the resulting mass and radius are strongly model-dependent and diverse (the 68.3% credible regions just overlap slightly for the ST+PDT and PDT-U models). By integrating this compactness data with the equation of state (EOS) refined by our latest investigations, we have deduced the mass and radius for PSR J0030+0451, delivering estimates of and for the compactness found in the ST+PDT model, alongside and for the compactness in the PDT-U model. These two groups of results are well consistent with each other and the direct X-ray data inference within the ST+PDT model seems to be favored. Additionally, we have calculated the tidal deformability, moment of inertia, and gravitational binding energy for this neutron star. Furthermore, employing these refined EOS models, we have updated mass–radius estimates for three INSs with established gravitational redshifts.

<title>An Angular Diameter Measurement of β UMa via Stellar Intensity Interferometry with the VERITAS Observatory</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We use the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging telescope Array System (VERITAS) imaging air Cherenkov telescope array to obtain the first measured angular diameter of β UMa at visual wavelengths using stellar intensity interferometry (SII) and independently constrain the limb-darkened angular diameter. The age of the Ursa Major moving group has been assessed from the ages of its members, including nuclear member Merak (β UMa), an A1-type subgiant, by comparing effective temperature and luminosity constraints to model stellar evolution tracks. Previous interferometric limb-darkened angular-diameter measurements of β UMa in the near-infrared (Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) Array, 1.149 ± 0.014 mas) and mid-infrared (Keck Nuller, 1.08 ± 0.07 mas), together with the measured parallax and bolometric flux, have constrained the effective temperature. This paper presents current VERITAS-SII observation and analysis procedures to derive squared visibilities from correlation functions. We fit the resulting squared visibilities to find a limb-darkened angular diameter of 1.07 ± 0.04 (stat) ± 0.05 (sys) mas, using synthetic visibilities from a stellar atmosphere model that provides a good match to the spectrum of β UMa in the optical wave band. The VERITAS-SII limb-darkened angular diameter yields an effective temperature of 9700 ± 200 ± 200 K, consistent with ultraviolet spectrophotometry, and an age of 390 ± 29 ± 32 Myr, using MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks. This age is consistent with 408 ± 6 Myr from the CHARA Array angular diameter.

总结:
该研究开发了一个模型，使用可观测的数量作为输入参数，如星系旋转曲线、气体、恒星和恒星形成率的表面密度，以及气体温度。模型可以用来估计磁场的随机和平均分量的参数，以及气体尺度高度、均方根速度和星际湍流的相关长度和时间，从观测量的角度来看。研究还评估了结果对湍流驱动不同假设的依赖性，并发现通过明确建模超新星遗迹的扩展和能量，可以改善与观测的一致性。该模型具有足够的灵活性，可以包括涉及的物理过程的替代方案，并提供两个实施该模型的开源Python程序的链接。 <div>
Galactic dynamo models have generally relied on input parameters that are very challenging to constrain. We address this problem by developing a model that uses observable quantities as input: the galaxy rotation curve, the surface densities of the gas, stars and star formation rate, and the gas temperature. The model can be used to estimate parameters of the random and mean components of the magnetic field, as well as the gas scale height, root-mean-square velocity and the correlation length and time of the interstellar turbulence, in terms of the observables. We use our model to derive theoretical scaling relations for the quantities of interest, finding reasonable agreement with empirical scaling relations inferred from observation. We assess the dependence of the results on different assumptions about turbulence driving, finding that agreement with observations is improved by explicitly modeling the expansion and energetics of supernova remnants. The model is flexible enough to include alternative prescriptions for the physical processes involved, and we provide links to two open-source python programs that implement it.

<div> NLS1s, AGNs, jets, radio emission, mid-infrared<br />
总结:<br />
本文研究了NLS1s的中红外特性，发现它们与射电暴星系和星暴星系在MIR颜色-颜色图中有重叠，但与SFGs和光学选择的射电星系有很大差别。同时发现NLS1s的射电和MIR辐射都受AGN活动的显著影响。一小部分射电亮度较高的NLS1s在射电-MIR图中与类星体相似，这说明它们的射电辐射由喷流主导。通过射电-MIR图中的射电过剩，发现了一些潜在的具有喷流的NLS1候选体。 <div>
Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s), a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in an early stage of the accretion process, are also found to host relativistic jets. However, currently known jetted NLS1s are rare. The majority of NLS1s are undetected at the radio band. The radio detection rate of NLS1s increases with the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS), which provides a good opportunity for finding more jetted NLS1s. The better sensitivity raises the question whether the radio emission of NLS1s with a low radio luminosity originates from the jet activity. In order to clarify the origin of the radio emission for NLS1s and search for more jetted NLS1s, we explore the mid-infrared properties of LoTSS-detected NLS1s by comparing them with known jetted AGNs and star-forming galaxies (SFGs), which are located above and on the well-studied radio/far-infrared correlation, respectively. The majority of NLS1s show mid-infrared (MIR) excess compared with SFGs. Their radio emission shows a significant correlation with the MIR emission. In the MIR color–color diagram, NLS1s overlap flat spectrum radio quasars, but they are well separated from SFGs and optically selected radio galaxies. The flux ratio of the radio and MIR emission of these NLS1s is also similar to that of a radio-quiet quasar with a weak jet. These results imply substantial contributions from the AGN activities for both the radio and MIR emission of NLS1s. A small fraction of NLS1s with relatively higher radio luminosities are located in a similar region as blazars in the radio-MIR diagram, which suggests that the radio emission of these NLS1s is dominated by the jet. We obtain a sample of jetted NLS1 candidates through their radio excess in the radio-MIR diagram.

<div> 高红移星系、JWST光谱、氮元素、恒星形成、化学丰度<br />
<br />总结:
这篇文章介绍了对高红移星系GN-z11的JWST光谱分析结果。研究发现，该星系的光谱显示了高度电离的氮元素特征，并通过星云建模测量了星云密度。研究人员还使用光电离模型和地球附近的低金属丰度星系进行比较，发现星系中氮气含量丰富，并认为这可能是密集星系中强烈星形成的独特标志。这些结果为高红移星系中的星团形成和化学丰度提供了新的见解。 <div>
The first JWST spectroscopy of the luminous galaxy GN-z11 simultaneously established its redshift at z = 10.6 and revealed a rest-ultraviolet spectrum dominated by signatures of highly ionized nitrogen, which has so far defied clear interpretation. We present a reappraisal of this spectrum in the context of both detailed nebular modeling and nearby metal-poor reference galaxies. The N iv] emission enables the first nebular density measurement in an apparently predominantly star-forming galaxy at z > 10, revealing evidence for extremely high densities ne ≳ 105 cm−3. With a suite of photoionization models, we establish that regardless of the ionization mechanism and accounting for depletion and this density enhancement, gas substantially enriched in nitrogen ([N/O] = +0.52 assuming the nebular emission is dominated by star formation) is required to reproduce the observed lines. We compare the GN-z11 spectrum to local UV databases and highlight a unique nearby galaxy, Mrk 996, where a high concentration of Wolf–Rayet stars and their CNO-processed ejecta produce a UV spectrum remarkably similar in some respects to that of GN-z11 and the Sunburst Arc. Collating this evidence in the context of Galactic stellar abundances, we suggest that the peculiar nitrogenic features prominent in GN-z11 may be a unique signature of intense and densely clustered star formation in the evolutionary chain of the present-day globular clusters, consistent with in situ early enrichment with nuclear-processed stellar ejecta on a massive scale. Combined with insight from local galaxies, these and future JWST data open a powerful new window into the physical conditions of star formation and chemical enrichment at the highest redshifts.

<div> 频率依赖、脉冲星定时、差异传播、时间误差、色散建模
总结:
本研究通过对宽带观测数据和窄带观测数据进行对比分析，发现使用减少频率范围会引入系统偏差。我们发现对于DM值较高的脉冲星，由于频率采样不完整造成的无穷频率到达时间会存在约22微秒的偏移，并且在约一个月的时间尺度上存在相关性。对于DM值较低的脉冲星，这个偏移约为7微秒。这种误差的量化可以用于在NANOGrav数据中提供更加健壮的噪声建模，从而提高灵敏度和改善引力波搜索中的参数估计。 <div>
Noise characterization for pulsar-timing applications accounts for interstellar dispersion by assuming a known frequency dependence of the delay it introduces in the times of arrival (TOAs). However, calculations of this delay suffer from misestimations due to other chromatic effects in the observations. The precision in modeling dispersion is dependent on the observed bandwidth. In this work, we calculate the offsets in infinite-frequency TOAs due to misestimations in the modeling of dispersion when using varying bandwidths at the Green Bank Telescope. We use a set of broadband observations of PSR J1643−1224, a pulsar with unusual chromatic timing behavior. We artificially restricted these observations to a narrowband frequency range, then used both the broad- and narrowband data sets to calculate residuals with a timing model that does not account for time variations in the dispersion. By fitting the resulting residuals to a dispersion model and comparing the fits, we quantify the error introduced in the timing parameters due to using a reduced frequency range. Moreover, by calculating the autocovariance function of the parameters, we obtained a characteristic timescale over which the dispersion misestimates are correlated. For PSR J1643−1224, which has one of the highest dispersion measures (DM) in the NANOGrav pulsar timing array, we find that the infinite-frequency TOAs suffer from a systematic offset of ∼22 μs due to incomplete frequency sampling, with correlations over about one month. For lower-DM pulsars, the offset is ∼7 μs. This error quantification can be used to provide more robust noise modeling in the NANOGrav data, thereby increasing the sensitivity and improving the parameter estimation in gravitational wave searches.

<div> Class 0 protostars, K-band spectra, accretion, Brγ emission, CO overtone emission
<br />
通过对26个Class 0原恒星的K波段光谱进行分析，发现了H i Brγ、H2和CO Δv = 2特征的检测和分析。Brγ发射在62%的源中检测到，CO overtone发射在50%的源中检测到，而H2发射在90%的源中检测到。H i和CO发射与吸积有关，而H2线与激波激发一致，表明存在喷流/流出。另外，六个物体表现出光球吸收特征，几乎没有流出活动，并且未检测到与吸积相关的Brγ发射线。将这些结果与Class I K-band光谱的文献样本进行比较，发现Class 0中CO和Brγ发射线的发射量普遍更大，这表明Class 0阶段的吸积平均更为激烈。Class 0中CO overtone发射的更高检测率通常与加热的内部吸积盘相关，表明Class 0系统中更频繁出现高吸积活动的阶段。Class 0 CO overtone发射的动力学特征表明，可能存在吸积加热的内部盘或物质直接落入中心区域的情况。这可能指向Class 0系统中不同性质的吸积机制，不同于 typica中幅卫星吸积的典型图片。<br /><br />总结:  这项研究分析了Class 0原恒星的K波段光谱，发现了吸积和喷流活动的迹象，并发现Class 0阶段的吸积更为激烈，并且更频繁出现高吸积活动的情况。此外，Class 0系统中可能存在着不同于typica中幅卫星吸积的吸积机制。 <div>
Sun-like stars are thought to accrete most of their final mass during the protostellar phase, during which the stellar embryo is surrounded by an infalling dense envelope. We present an analysis of 26 K-band spectra of Class 0 protostars, which are the youngest protostars. Of these, 18 are new observations made with the Keck MOSFIRE instrument. H i Brγ, several H2, and CO Δv = 2 features are detected and analyzed. We detect Brγ emission in 62%, CO overtone emission in 50%, and H2 emission in 90% of sources. The H i and CO emission is associated with accretion, while the H2 lines are consistent with shock excitation indicating jets/outflows. Six objects exhibit photospheric absorption features, with almost no outflow activity and no detection of the accretion-related Brγ emission line. Comparing these results with an archival sample of Class I K-band spectra, we find that the CO and Brγ emission lines are systematically more luminous in Class 0s, suggesting that the accretion is on average more vigorous in the Class 0 phase. Typically associated with the heated inner accretion disk, the much higher detection rate of CO overtone emission in Class 0s indicates also that episodes of high accretion activity are more frequent in Class 0 systems. The kinematics of the Class 0 CO overtone emission suggest either an accretion-heated inner disk or material directly infalling onto the central region. This could point toward an accretion mechanism of different nature in Class 0 systems than the typical picture of magnetospheric accretion.

<div> 关键词: protoplanetary disk turbulence, ansatz, Shakura–Sunyaev α parameter, Keplerian frequency, particle collision dynamics

总结:<br /><br />本文讨论了原行星盘湍流的理论，并探讨了一个广泛采用的假设，即最大湍流涡的周转频率ΩL等于局部开普勒频率ΩK的假设。文章指出这种假设不适用于数值强迫湍流或由自然过程驱动的情况。作者提出了更一般的情况，并研究了当ΩL ≥ ΩK时的特征长度和速度比例。文章还提到了在这种情况下的影响，对粒子碰撞动力学、成长以及行星形成等方面产生了重要影响。文章的研究有助于解释近期对边缘盘的观测，并对观测结果有着更一般的影响。 <div>
In the theory of protoplanetary disk turbulence, a widely adopted ansatz, or assumption, is that the turnover frequency of the largest turbulent eddy, ΩL, is the local Keplerian frequency ΩK. In terms of the standard dimensionless Shakura–Sunyaev α parameter that quantifies turbulent viscosity or diffusivity, this assumption leads to characteristic length and velocity scales given respectively by and , in which H and c are the local gas scale height and sound speed. However, this assumption is not applicable in cases when turbulence is forced numerically or driven by some natural processes such as vertical shear instability. Here, we explore the more general case where ΩL ≥ ΩK and show that, under these conditions, the characteristic length and velocity scales are respectively and , where is twice the Rossby number. It follows that , where is the root-mean-square average of the turbulent velocities. Properly allowing for this effect naturally explains the reduced particle scale heights produced in shearing box simulations of particles in forced turbulence, and it may help with interpreting recent edge-on disk observations; more general implications for observations are also presented. For , the effective particle Stokes numbers are increased, which has implications for particle collision dynamics and growth, as well as for planetesimal formation.

<div> 红巨星分支、JWST、F090W、NGC 4258、银河系距离测量
总结:
红巨星分支（TRGB）是利用低质量红巨星在氦闪之前的最亮上升来测量邻近星系精确距离的技术。JWST的出现使得该技术可以测量至少50 Mpc的星系距离，大大超过HST的20 Mpc的范围。使用F090W滤光片的绝对校准提供了TRGB测量的绝对参考。NGC 4258的图像数据提供了直接的几何距离测量，利用几种测量技术，得到了金属贫乏TRGB为-4.362 ± 0.033 (stat) ± 0.045 (sys)等级（vega）的结果。对NGC 1559和NGC 5584进行的TRGB测量与以前用Cepheids方法测得的距离结果一致。此外，还意外发现了NGC 5584附近的一个微弱的矮星系。 <div>
The tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) allows for the measurement of precise and accurate distances to nearby galaxies based on the brightest ascent of low-mass red giant branch stars before they undergo the helium flash. With the advent of JWST, there is great promise to utilize the technique to measure galaxy distances out to at least 50 Mpc, significantly further than the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST's) reach of 20 Mpc. However, with any standard candle, it is first necessary to provide an absolute reference. Here, we use Cycle 1 data to provide an absolute calibration in the F090W filter. F090W is most similar to the F814W filter commonly used for TRGB measurements with HST, which had been adopted by the community due to its minimal dependence on the underlying metallicities and ages of stars. The imaging we use was taken in the outskirts of NGC 4258, which has a direct geometrical distance measurement from the Keplerian motion of its water megamaser. Utilizing several measurement techniques, we find = −4.362 ± 0.033 (stat) ± 0.045 (sys) mag (Vega) for the metal-poor TRGB. We also perform measurements of the TRGB in two Type Ia supernova hosts, NGC 1559 and NGC 5584. We find good agreement between our TRGB distances and previous determinations of distances to these galaxies from Cepheids (Δ = 0.01 ± 0.06 mag), with these differences being too small to explain the Hubble tension (∼0.17 mag). In addition, we showcase the serendipitous discovery of a faint dwarf galaxy near NGC 5584.

太阳耀斑脉冲指数的研究对太阳动力学和恒星耀斑物理有重要意义。研究使用Solar Dynamics Observatory的304 Å光谱曲线计算了1368次太阳耀斑的脉冲指数，并将事件分为低、中和高脉冲性三类。研究发现，最大重联速率高的耀斑往往也具有高脉冲性。还发现，在一些案例研究中，脉冲指数与磁场剪切、带状演化和能量释放有关。这些发现有助于理解耀斑的脉冲性及其与其他特性的关系。需要更多研究验证这一关系，并将研究结果应用到恒星耀斑物理中。<br /><br />总结: <br />太阳耀斑脉冲指数对太阳活动和恒星耀斑物理具有重要意义，研究发现耀斑的脉冲性与重联速率、磁场剪切、带状演化和能量释放相关，有助于理解其它特性的关系。需要更多研究来验证这些发现，并将其应用到恒星耀斑物理中。 <div>
We develop the impulsiveness index, a new classification system for solar flares using the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Extreme Ultraviolet Experiment 304 Å Sun-as-a-star light curves. Impulsiveness classifies events based on the duration and intensity of the initial high-energy deposition of energy into the chromosphere. In stellar flare U-band light curves, Kowalski et al. found that impulsiveness is related to quantities such as a proxy for the Balmer jump ratio. However, the lack of direct spatial resolution in stellar flares limits our ability to explain this phenomenon. We calculate impulsiveness for 1368 solar flares between 2010 April and 2014 May. We divide events into categories of low, mid, and high impulsiveness. We find, in a sample of 480 flares, that events with high maximum reconnection rate tend to also have high impulsiveness. For six case studies, we compare impulsiveness to magnetic shear, ribbon evolution, and energy release. We find that the end of the 304 Å light-curve rise phase in these case studies corresponds to the cessation of polarity inversion line (PIL)-parallel ribbon motion, while PIL-perpendicular motion persists afterward in most cases. The measured guide-field ratio for low- and mid-impulsiveness case-study flares decreases about an order of magnitude during the impulsive flare phase. Finally, we find that, in four of the six case studies, flares with higher, more persistent shear tend to have low impulsiveness. Our study suggests that impulsiveness may be related to other properties of the impulsive phase, though more work is needed to verify this relationship and apply our findings to stellar flare physics.

<div> MW-like satellite systems, ram pressure stripping, gas fraction, cosmological zoom-in simulations, ultra-diffuse galaxy
<br /><br />总结: 本研究通过观测8个MW样本系统的45颗卫星，发现其中有4颗正在经历RPS。此外，在MW样本系统中观察到了气体分数随着卫星与宿主的距离减小而明显下降的现象。对比宇宙学局部环境模拟和TNG50宇宙尺度模拟，发现它们低估了大约0.5 dex的气体分数。通过简单的RPS模型，估计卫星遭遇的平均峰值CGM密度。最后，发现UGC 903系统中存在一个新的富气体卫星，其光学大小和表面亮度符合超弥散星系的标准。 <div>
We have imaged the entirety of eight (plus one partial) Milky Way (MW)–like satellite systems, a total of 42 (45) satellites, from the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs II catalog in both Hα and H i with the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope and the Jansky Very Large Array. In these eight systems we have identified four cases where a satellite appears to be currently undergoing ram pressure stripping (RPS) as its H i gas collides with the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of its host. We also see a clear suppression of gas fraction (MHI/M*) with decreasing (projected) satellite–host separation—to our knowledge, the first time this has been observed in a sample of MW-like systems. Comparisons to the Auriga, A Project Of Simulating The Local Environment, and TNG50 cosmological zoom-in simulations show consistent global behavior, but they systematically underpredict gas fractions across all satellites by roughly 0.5 dex. Using a simplistic RPS model, we estimate the average peak CGM density that satellites in these systems have encountered to be . Furthermore, we see tentative evidence that these satellites are following a specific star formation rate to gas fraction relation that is distinct from field galaxies. Finally, we detect one new gas-rich satellite in the UGC 903 system with an optical size and surface brightness meeting the standard criteria to be considered an ultra-diffuse galaxy.

Plasma flow–obstacle interactions, such as those between an exoplanet’s magnetosphere and the host star’s stellar wind, may lead to detectable radio emissions. Despite many attempts to detect magnetospheric (auroral) radio emissions from exoplanets, a reproducible, unambiguous detection remains elusive. This fourth paper of the Radio Observations of Magnetized Exoplanets (ROME) series presents the results of a targeted radio survey of nine nearby systems that host exoplanet, brown dwarf, or low-mass-stellar companions conducted with the Arecibo radio telescope at ∼5 GHz. This search for magnetospheric radio emissions has the greatest sensitivity (∼1 mJy during <1 s integration times) and collected full Stokes parameters over the largest simultaneous bandpass of any survey to date. It is also the first survey to search for radio emission from brown dwarfs of spectral class Y, which may illuminate open questions regarding their magnetism, interior and atmospheric structure, and formation histories. No magnetospheric radio emissions from substellar companions were detected. These results are examined within the context of recent theoretical work on plasma flow–obstacle interactions, and radio emissions observed from the solar system planets and ultracool dwarfs.

<div> DMDGs, UDGs, Mini-Bullet scenario, NGC 1052, ΛCDM simulation
总结:
通过对超弥漫星系的调查，发现了缺乏暗物质的星系（DMDGs），这与标准冷暗物质理论存在冲突。研究表明，高速星系碰撞（Mini-Bullet场景）可能是这些星系形成的原因。最近观察到了在NGC 1052附近的7-11个UDGs的轨迹，并推测它们在大约89亿年前共同形成。通过模拟和星系轨道计算，发现主星系外的卫星星系碰撞可以复制NGC 1052星系组中观察到的UDGs。这些结果表明，目前的观测与Mini-Bullet场景是一致的。 <div>
Dark-matter-deficient galaxies (DMDGs) discovered in the survey of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs), in apparent conflict with standard cold dark matter, may be produced by high-velocity galaxy–galaxy collisions, the so-called Mini-Bullet scenario. Recent observations of an aligned trail of 7–11 UDGs near NGC 1052, including DMDGs DF2 and DF4, suggesting a common formation event, ∼8.9 ± 1.5 Gyr ago, provide a test.Hydro/N-body simulations, supplemented by galaxy orbit integrations, demonstrate that satellite–satellite collisions outside the host-galaxy virial radius can reproduce the observed UDGs in the NGC 1052 group. A trail of ∼10 DMDGs is shown to form, including 2 massive ones that replicate the observed motions of DF2 and DF4. The linear relation, v = Ax + v0, conjectured previously to relate positions (x) and velocities (v) of the aligned DMDGs as a signature of the collision event, is approximately obeyed, but individual DMDGs can deviate significantly from it. The progenitors whose collision spawned the trail of DMDGs survive the collision without themselves becoming DMDGs. We predict that one progenitor is located at the end of the trail, which can be tested by observing the difference between its stars, formed pre-collision, from those of the DMDGs, formed post-collision. By contrast, stellar ages and metallicities of the DMDGs are nearly identical. We further offer a hint that the tidal field of host NGC 1052 may contribute to making DMDGs diffuse. ΛCDM simulation in a 100 cMpc box finds our required initial conditions ∼10 times at z < 3. These results indicate current observations are consistent with the Mini-Bullet scenario.

总结：本研究通过Voyager 2号探测器的磁场测量数据，在1到33天文单位的距离范围内研究了惯性范围太阳风等离子体湍流的径向演化和各向异性。研究发现，垂直和迹向磁场功率谱密度仍然遵循科尔莫哥洛夫谱直至33天文单位。与此同时，平行磁场功率谱密度在穿越10天文单位时从-2的幂律指数过渡到-5/3。在20天文单位后，频率在0.01赫兹到0.2赫兹范围内的功率谱密度逐渐变平，逼近f^(-1)谱。在频率低于0.01赫兹时，由于传播角度小于20°的波能级增强，功率谱密度随传播角度减小而减小。这种增强可能来源于离子加速的波能量注入背景湍流级联中，并且注入的波能量在各个尺度间传递，没有留下局部的功率密度或功率谱密度增强。 <br /><br /> <div>
We study the radial evolution of the inertial-range solar wind plasma turbulence and its anisotropy in the outer heliosphere. We use magnetic field (B) measurements from the Voyager 2 spacecraft for heliocentric distances R from 1 to 33 au. We find that the perpendicular and trace power spectral densities (PSDs) of the magnetic field ( and ) still follow a Kolmogorov-like spectrum until 33 au. The parallel magnetic field PSD, , transits from a power-law index of −2 to −5/3 as the distance crosses R ∼ 10 au. The PSD at frequencies 0.01 Hz < f < 0.2 Hz flattens at R > 20 au, gradually approaching an f−1 spectrum, probably due to instrument noise. At 0.002 Hz < f < 0.1 Hz, quasi-parallel propagation dominates at 1 au < R < 7 au, with quasi-perpendicular propagation gradually emerging at R > 5 au. For R > 7 au, oblique propagation becomes the primary mode of propagation. At smaller frequencies of f < 0.01 Hz, increases with propagation angle at 1 au < R < 5 au, and in contrast decreases with propagation angle at R > 5 au due to the enhanced power level at propagation angles smaller than 20°. Such enhancement may derive from the injection of wave energy from the pickup ion source into the background turbulent cascade, and the injected wave energy is transferred across scales without leaving local enhancements in or .

<div> FeLoBALQs, spectral energy distributions, near-infrared variability, reddening, accretion rate<br />总结:
这篇文章研究了30个低红移的低离子化铁吸收发射线类星体（FeLoBALQs），并与LoBALQs和未吸收类星体进行了比较。研究发现未吸收比较样本中的光谱性质与促成率指标之间存在显著的相关性，而FeLoBAL类星体中由于一定范围的泛红可能抑制了这些相关性。还发现光学波段的红化与外流位置有关，表明外流与尘埃之间存在连接。WISE变化性分析显示变化幅度与推断的连续发射区域尺寸之间存在反相关关系，这解释了类星体中变化幅度与亮度之间的反相关关系。LoBALQ的光学发射线和其他参数更类似于未吸收连续谱样本对象，而FeLoBAL类星体则是一个特殊的对象群。根据促成率场景，解释了FeLoBAL类星体的结果，即高促成率的FeLoBAL类星体辐射强大到足以产生厚重、高速的外流，而中等促成率的类星体可能存在外流，但不足以包含Fe ii吸收，低促成率的FeLoBAL外流来自于一个失败的环状结构吸收，无法再将辐射转换成近红外光。 <div>
We present the optical–near-infrared spectral energy distributions (SED) and near-infrared variability properties of 30 low-redshift iron low-ionization Broad Absorption Line quasars (FeLoBALQs) and matched samples of LoBALQs and unabsorbed quasars. Significant correlations between the SED properties and accretion rate indicators found among the unabsorbed comparison sample objects suggest an intrinsic origin for SED differences. A range of reddening likely mutes these correlations among the FeLoBAL quasars. The rest-frame optical-band reddening is correlated with the location of the outflow, suggesting a link between the outflows and the presence of dust. We analyzed the WISE variability and provide a correction for photometry uncertainties in an appendix. We found an anticorrelation between the variability amplitude and inferred continuum emission region size, and we suggest that as the origin of the anticorrelation between variability amplitude and luminosity typically observed in quasars. We found that the LoBALQ Optical Emission-line and other parameters are more similar to those of the unabsorbed continuum sample objects than the FeLoBALQs. Thus, FeLoBAL quasars are a special population of objects. We interpret the results using an accretion-rate scenario for FeLoBAL quasars. The high-accretion-rate FeLoBAL quasars are radiating powerfully enough to drive a thick, high-velocity outflow. Quasars with intermediate accretion rates may have an outflow, but it is not sufficiently thick to include Fe ii absorption. Low-accretion-rate FeLoBAL outflows originate in absorption in a failing torus, no longer optically thick enough to reprocess radiation into the near-IR.

总结:
AB Dor是一个超快自转的活跃恒星，X射线观测显示其存在频繁的耀斑事件，耀斑事件占据了观测时间的大部分。在没有耀斑的X射线光变曲线中，显示了旋转调制的特征，表明恒星的日冕中存在高度活跃的区域。通过日冕成像发现了两个不同亮度的活跃区域，并观察到它们在经度上的变化和亮度上的变化。长期X射线数据分析发现存在多个周期性，包括一个类似太阳的长期模式和可能与翻转循环相关的周期。需要进一步的长期观测来确认X射线翻转循环的存在。 <br /><br /> <div>
Using long-term X-ray observations, we present short-term and long-term X-ray variability analysis of the ultrafast rotating active star AB Dor. Flaring events are common in X-ray observations of AB Dor and occupy a substantial portion of the total observation time, averaging at around 57% ± 23%. The flare-free X-ray light curves show rotational modulation, indicating the presence of highly active regions in the star's corona. We have developed a light-curve inversion code to image the corona of active fast rotating stars. The results of coronal imaging reveal the presence of two active regions of different brightness that are separated by ∼180° in longitude. These active regions are also found to migrate along the longitude and also show variation in their brightness. Our analysis of long-term X-ray data spanning from 1979 to 2022 shows multiple periodicities. The existence of a ∼19.2 yr cycle and its first harmonic indicates the presence of a solar-like, long-term pattern. In comparison, the periodicities of ∼3.6 and ∼5.4 yr are possibly due to the presence of a flip-flop cycle in the X-rays, which is also supported by findings for similar periods from the optical data in earlier studies. Further confirmation of the existence of the X-ray flip-flop cycle requires long-term observations at regular intervals in the quiescent state.

<div> 关键词: CL-AGNs, Sloan Digital Sky Survey V, 超大质量黑洞, 光谱变化, Eddington比率<br />
总结: <br />这篇文章报告了关于"Changing-look" active galactic nuclei (CL-AGNs)的研究成果，通过对近29,000个已知活跃星系核的多次光谱观测和跟踪，发现了116个CL-AGN案例，并对其进行了分析。研究发现，CL事件在低Eddington比率系统中更常见，并且发现了广泛的Mg ii发射线变化较小的趋势。这个研究样本是迄今为止报道的最大的CL-AGN样本，对于研究极端AGN变化和物理学具有重要意义。 <br /> <div>
“Changing-look” active galactic nuclei (CL-AGNs) challenge our basic ideas about the physics of accretion flows and circumnuclear gas around supermassive black holes. Using first-year Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V) repeated spectroscopy of nearly 29,000 previously known active galactic nuclei (AGNs), combined with dedicated follow-up spectroscopy, and publicly available optical light curves, we have identified 116 CL-AGNs where (at least) one broad emission line has essentially (dis-)appeared, as well as 88 other extremely variable systems. Our CL-AGN sample, with 107 newly identified cases, is the largest reported to date, and includes ∼0.4% of the AGNs reobserved in first-year SDSS-V operations. Among our CL-AGNs, 67% exhibit dimming while 33% exhibit brightening. Our sample probes extreme AGN spectral variability on months to decades timescales, including some cases of recurring transitions on surprisingly short timescales (≲2 months in the rest frame). We find that CL events are preferentially found in lower-Eddington-ratio (fEdd) systems: Our CL-AGNs have a fEdd distribution that significantly differs from that of a carefully constructed, redshift- and luminosity-matched control sample (Anderson–Darling test yielding pAD ≈ 6 × 10−5; median fEdd ≈ 0.025 versus 0.043). This preference for low fEdd strengthens previous findings of higher CL-AGN incidence at lower fEdd, found in smaller samples. Finally, we show that the broad Mg ii emission line in our CL-AGN sample tends to vary significantly less than the broad Hβ emission line. Our large CL-AGN sample demonstrates the advantages and challenges in using multi-epoch spectroscopy from large surveys to study extreme AGN variability and physics.

<div> UHECR, dipole anisotropy, extragalactic magnetic field, number density, CosmicFlows-2<br />
总结: 该研究确认了超高能宇宙射线到达方向的偶极各向异性，并对小尺度各向异性进行了限制，进而制约了外星系磁场和UHECR源的数量密度。研究表明UHECR源的偏好分布与外星系物质的密度分布关系不大。通过对局部宇宙的密度分布进行处理，并考虑了宇宙射线在传播过程中的相互作用和能量损失以及银河磁场的影响，得到了良好的模拟结果。 <div>
A dipole anisotropy in ultra–high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) arrival directions, of extragalactic origin, is now firmly established at energies E > 8 EeV. Furthermore, the UHECR angular power spectrum shows no power at smaller angular scales than the dipole, apart from hints of possible individual hot or warm spots for energy thresholds ≳40 EeV. Here we exploit the magnitude of the dipole and the limits on smaller-scale anisotropies to place constraints on two quantities: the extragalactic magnetic field (EGMF) and the number density of UHECR sources or the volumetric event rate if UHECR sources are transient. We also vary the bias between the extragalactic matter and the UHECR source densities, reflecting whether UHECR sources are preferentially found in over- or underdense regions, and find that little or no bias is favored. We follow Ding et al. (2021) in using the CosmicFlows-2 density distribution of the local universe as our baseline distribution of UHECR sources, but we improve and extend that work by employing an accurate and self-consistent treatment of interactions and energy losses during propagation. Deflections in the Galactic magnetic field are treated using either the full JF12 magnetic field model, with both random and coherent components, or just the coherent part, to bracket the impact of the GMF on the dipole anisotropy. This large-scale structure model gives good agreement with both the direction and magnitude of the measured dipole anisotropy and forms the basis for simulations of discrete sources and the inclusion of EGMF effects.

总结: 该研究分析了N2H+、HCO+、HCN和C18O等分子在20个原行星盘中的排放情况，并发现了这些分子通量与盘尘质量和半径之间存在着正相关关系。此外，不同分子种类的通量之间也存在着较强的正相关性。然而，一些盘可能在这些分子通量上表现出明显的差异，甚至在同一星际成形区域内也有所不同。这表明了类似年龄和形成环境的系统可能拥有不同范围内的盘质量和化学成分。未来需要更全面和统一的样本来寻找与形成环境或年龄相关的趋势。 <br /><br />  
总结: <div>
Molecular emission is used to investigate both the physical and chemical properties of protoplanetary disks. Therefore, to derive disk properties accurately, we need a thorough understanding of the behavior of the molecular probes upon which we rely. Here we investigate how the molecular line emission of N2H+, HCO+, HCN, and C18O compare to other measured quantities in a set of 20 protoplanetary disks. Overall, we find positive correlations between multiple line fluxes and the disk dust mass and radius. We also generally find strong positive correlations between the line fluxes of different molecular species. However, some disks do show noticeable differences in the relative fluxes of N2H+, HCO+, HCN, and C18O. These differences occur even within a single star-forming region. This results in a potentially large range of different disk masses and chemical compositions for systems of similar age and birth environment. While we make preliminary comparisons of molecular fluxes across different star-forming regions, more complete and uniform samples are needed in the future to search for trends with birth environment or age.

TV Col是一个长周期的淡变型中间极光星，研究了TESS光度测量数据。发现NSH振幅和日食深度都有周期性变化，NSH振幅的周期与日食极小的周期非常接近，这进一步证实了NSH的形成与倾斜盘进动有关。同时发现日食深度存在双周期性变化，可能与倾斜盘的进动有关。这一发现为研究中间极光星和倾斜盘的进动提供了新的视角。 
<br />总结: TV Col是一个长周期的淡变型中间极光星，NSH振幅和日食深度都有周期性变化，与倾斜盘进动有关。同时发现日食深度存在双周期性变化，可能与倾斜盘的进动有关。 <div>
TV Col is a long-period eclipsing intermediate polar (IP) prototype star for the negative superhump (NSH) system. We investigate the eclipse minima, eclipse depth, and NSH amplitude based on TESS photometry. Using the same analytical method as for SDSS J081256.85+191157.8, we find periodic variations of O − C for eclipse minima and NSH amplitudes with periods of 3.939(25) days and 3.907(30) days, respectively. The periodic variation of the NSH amplitude of TV Col confirms that periodic changes in NSH amplitude in response to the tilted disk precession may be universal, which is further evidence that the origin of the NSHs is related to the tilted disk precession. We suggest that the variation in NSH amplitude may be similar to the superorbital signal, coming from the periodic change in visual brightness of the energy released by streams touching the tilted disk with tilted disk precession. Finally, we find for the first time that the eclipse depth exhibits biperiodic variations with periods of P1 = 3.905(11) days and P2 = 1.953(4) days, respectively. P2 is about half of P1 and the disk precession period (P1 ≈ Pprec ≈ 2 × P2). We suggest that P1 may come from the periodic change in the brightness of the eclipse center due to tilted disk precession, while P2 may come from two accretion curtains precessing together with the tilted disk, but more verification and discussion are necessary. The discovery of biperiodic variations in eclipse depth provides a new window for studying IPs and tilted disk precession.

We investigate the formation of an ideal magnetized jet that originates from a disk acting as a boundary by conducting axisymmetric MHD simulations. Our simulations demonstrate that the magnetized jet is consistently launched and reaches a stable state. To further advance our study, we extended the model setup to three dimensions and performed 3D MHD simulations of the jet launched from a disk surface, achieving a stable and appropriate model setup. Additionally, we expanded our study by incorporating the companion star and examining the influence of the Roche potential on the jet material. Specifically, we investigate whether including the companion star in the model significantly affects the dynamical evolution of the jet. Our findings reveal the formation of an arc-like structure in the density map of the jet cross section, which is attributed to the direct tidal effects. This implies that while the primary physical effects and characteristics of the outflow on a larger scale are attributed to the host accretion disk, the direct tidal effects on the jet dynamics have a substantial impact, particularly in the vicinity of the Roche lobe and toward the secondary star.

<div> 关键词：稀疏化区域，太阳风，质子参数，α参数，太阳风界面
总结：<br /><br />本研究通过对稀疏化区域进行超级对应时段分析，观察了质子和α粒子参数的渐进演化。稀疏化区域内并没有找到明显的快慢太阳风的边界，大多数观测表明大部分的稀疏化区域等离子体对应于快速太阳风；只有α-质子漂移速度从稀疏化区域开始有所减小。我们研究了它在星际空间内减小的不同方式，并表明这一特征很可能与多组分太阳风的镜像有关。然而，考虑到观测到的太阳风特性和质子参数之间的相互关系，我们定义了在α相对丰度和α-质子温度比急剧变化为典型快速太阳风向慢速太阳风值的组成边界。这一边界是可能的太阳风界面的最有可能的候选者。基于这些发现，我们推测稀疏化区域的形成已经在太阳附近开始，并提出了两种可能的情景。 <div>
A rarefaction region (RR) occurs at the trailing edge of the fast solar wind stream. It comes from an area of small longitudinal extent on the solar surface and exhibits a fine and complex structure. In our study, we did a superposed epoch analysis of the proton and α parameters across the RR and observed their gradual evolution. We did not find any clear boundary between the fast and slow solar winds inside the RR because a majority of our observations show that most of the RR plasma corresponds to the fast solar wind; only the α–proton drift velocity decreases from the beginning of the RR. We investigate different ways of its reduction in interplanetary space and show that this feature is likely associated with the mirroring of the multicomponent solar wind. Nevertheless, considering the observed solar wind characteristics and taking into account the mutual relations between the proton and α parameters, we define the composition boundary where the α relative abundance and α–proton temperature ratio change abruptly from the values typical for the fast wind toward slow wind values. This boundary is the most probable candidate for the stream interface. Based on these findings, we speculate that the RR formation starts already near the Sun and formulate two possible scenarios.

<title>METAL-Z: Measuring Dust Depletion in Low-metallicity Dwarf Galaxies</title>

The cycling of metals between interstellar gas and dust is a critical aspect of the baryon cycle of galaxies, yet our understanding of this process is limited. This study focuses on understanding dust depletion effects in the low-metallicity regime (<20% Z⊙) typical of cosmic noon. Using medium-resolution UV spectroscopy from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope, gas-phase abundances and depletions of iron and sulfur were derived toward 18 sight lines in local dwarf galaxies IC 1613 and Sextans A. The results show that the depletion of Fe and S is consistent with that found in the Milky Way (MW), LMC, and SMC. The depletion level of Fe increases with gas column density, indicating dust growth in the interstellar medium. The level of Fe depletion decreases with decreasing metallicity, resulting in the fraction of iron in gas ranging from 3% in the MW to 9% in IC 1613 and ∼19% in Sextans A. The dust-to-gas and dust-to-metal ratios (D/G, D/M) for these dwarf galaxies were estimated based on the MW relations between the depletion of Fe and other elements. The study finds that D/G decreases only slightly sublinearly with metallicity, with D/M decreasing from 0.41 ± 0.05 in the MW to 0.11 ± 0.11 at 0.10 Z⊙ (at log N(H) = 21 cm−2). The trend of D/G versus metallicity using depletion in local systems is similar to that inferred in Damped Lyα systems from abundance ratios but lies higher than the trend inferred from far-IR measurements in nearby galaxies.

<title>Cost of Inferred Nuclear Parameters toward the f-mode Dynamical Tide in Binary Neutron Stars</title>

Gravitational-wave (GW) observations from neutron stars (NSs) in a binary system provide an excellent scenario to constrain the nuclear parameters. The investigation of Pratten et al. has shown that the ignorance of f-mode dynamical tidal correction in the GW waveform model of the binary NS system can lead to substantial bias in the measurement of NS properties and NS equations of state. In this work, we investigate the bias in the nuclear parameters resulting from the ignorance of dynamical tidal correction. In addition, this work demonstrates the sensitivity of the nuclear parameters and the estimated constraints on nuclear parameters and NS properties from future GW observations. We infer the nuclear parameters from GW observations by describing the NS matter within the relativistic mean field model. For a population of GW events, we notice that the ignorance of dynamical tide predicts a lower median for nucleon effective mass (m*) by ∼6% compared to the scenario when dynamical tidal correction is considered. Whereas, at a 90% credible interval, m* gets constrained up to ∼5% and ∼3% in A+ (the LIGO-Virgo detectors with a sensitivity of the fifth observing run) and Cosmic Explorer, respectively. We also discuss the resulting constraints on all other nuclear parameters, including compressibility, symmetry energy, and slope of symmetry energy, considering an ensemble of GW events. We do not notice any significant impact in analyzing nuclear parameters other than m* due to the ignorance of f-mode dynamical tides.

The solar minima between solar cycles 22–23, 23–24, and 24–25 are the best observed minima on record. In situ solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field measurements by the Wind and ACE spacecraft at L1 with 1 hr cadence are explored using wavelet analyses for the most quiescent year during each minimum. Times of local peaks in periodicities are identified in the solar wind velocity, magnetic field components, and proton number densities. The measured radial velocities at these times are used to trace magnetic field lines to the photosphere using two models. The first is the Fisk heliospheric magnetic field that traces field lines from L1 to the photosphere. They connect exclusively to solar poles and in 88% of instances to locations of polar coronal holes (PCHs). The second model uses the Parker spiral to trace from L1 to the solar source surface and potential-field extrapolations from the source surface to the photosphere. These field lines terminate at equatorial and midlatitude coordinates, of which some are located close to coronal holes (CHs). This study connects for the first time CH signatures in the ecliptic plane at L1 with PCHs using the Fisk field. It shows how sources from both the solar equator and poles influence the solar wind at L1 and how the two models complement each other to identify these sources.

<title>Limits on the OH Molecule in the Smith High-velocity Cloud</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have used the Green Bank Telescope to search for the OH molecule at several locations in the Smith Cloud, one of the most prominent of the high-velocity clouds surrounding the Milky Way. Five positions with high H i column density were selected as targets for individual pointings, along with a square degree around a molecular cloud detected with the Planck telescope near the tip of the Smith Cloud. Gas in the Galactic disk with similar values of NHI has detectable OH emission. Although we found OH at velocities consistent with the foreground Aquila molecular cloud, nothing was found at the velocity of the Smith Cloud to an rms level of 0.7 mK (Tb) in a 1 km s−1 channel. The three positions that give the strictest limits on OH are analyzed in detail. Their combined data imply a 5σ limit on N(H2)/NHI ≤ 0.03, scaled by a factor dependent on the OH excitation temperature and background continuum Tex/(Tex − Tbg). There is no evidence for far-infrared emission from dust within the Smith Cloud. These results are consistent with expectations for a low-metallicity diffuse cloud exposed to the radiation field of the Galactic halo, rather than a product of a galactic fountain.

<title>Characterization of Turbulent Fluctuations in the Sub-Alfvénic Solar Wind</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observed sub-Alfvénic solar wind intervals during encounters 8–14, and low-frequency magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in these regions may differ from that in super-Alfvénic wind. We apply a new mode decomposition analysis to the sub-Alfvénic flow observed by PSP on 2021 April 28, identifying and characterizing entropy, magnetic islands, forward and backward Alfvén waves, including weakly/nonpropagating Alfvén vortices, forward and backward fast and slow magnetosonic (MS) modes. Density fluctuations are primarily and almost equally entropy- and backward-propagating slow MS modes. The mode decomposition provides phase information (frequency and wavenumber k) for each mode. Entropy density fluctuations have a wavenumber anisotropy of k∥ ≫ k⊥, whereas slow-mode density fluctuations have k⊥ > k∥. Magnetic field fluctuations are primarily magnetic island modes (δBi) with an O(1) smaller contribution from unidirectionally propagating Alfvén waves (δBA+) giving a variance anisotropy of . Incompressible magnetic fluctuations dominate compressible contributions from fast and slow MS modes. The magnetic island spectrum is Kolmogorov-like in perpendicular wavenumber, and the unidirectional Alfvén wave spectra are and . Fast MS modes propagate at essentially the Alfvén speed with anticorrelated transverse velocity and magnetic field fluctuations and are almost exclusively magnetic due to βp ≪ 1. Transverse velocity fluctuations are the dominant velocity component in fast MS modes, and longitudinal fluctuations dominate in slow modes. Mode decomposition is an effective tool in identifying the basic building blocks of MHD turbulence and provides detailed phase information about each of the modes.

<title>A Steep Decline in the Galaxy Space Density beyond Redshift 9 in the CANUCS UV Luminosity Function</title>

We present a new sample of 158 galaxies at redshift z > 7.5 selected from deep James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam imaging of five widely separated sight lines in the CANUCS survey. Two-thirds of the pointings and 80% of the galaxies are covered by 12–14 NIRCam filters, including seven to nine medium bands, providing accurate photometric redshifts and robustness against low-redshift interlopers. A sample of 28 galaxies at z > 7.5 with spectroscopic redshifts shows a low systematic offset and scatter in the difference between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts. We derive the galaxy UV luminosity function at redshifts 8–12, finding a slightly higher normalization than previously seen with the Hubble Space Telescope at redshifts 8–10. We observe a steeper decline in the galaxy space density from z = 8 to 12 than found by most JWST Cycle 1 studies. In particular, we find only eight galaxies at z > 10 and none at z > 12.5, with no z > 10 galaxies brighter than F277W AB = 28 or MUV = −20 in our unmasked, delensed survey area of 53.4 arcmin2. We attribute the lack of bright z > 10 galaxies in CANUCS compared to GLASS and CEERS to intrinsic variance in the galaxy density along different sight lines. The evolution in the CANUCS luminosity function between z = 8 and 12 is comparable to that predicted by simulations that assume a standard star formation efficiency without invoking any special adjustments.

<title>Halo Asymmetry in the Modeling of Galaxy Clustering</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Conventional studies of galaxy clustering within the framework of halo models typically assume that the density profile of all dark matter halos can be approximated by the Navarro–Frenk–White (NFW) spherically symmetric profile. However, both modern N-body simulations and observational data suggest that most halos are either oblate or prolate, and almost never spherical. In this paper we present a modified model of the galaxy correlation function. In addition to the five “classical” halo occupation distribution (HOD) parameters proposed by Zheng et al., it includes an additional free parameter ϕ in the modified NFW density profile describing the asymmetry of the host dark matter halo. Using a subhalo abundance matching model, we populate galaxies within BolshoiP N-body simulations. We compute the projected two-point correlation function wp(rp) for six stellar-mass volume-limited galaxy samples. We fit our model to the results and then compare the best-fit asymmetry parameter ϕ (and other halo parameters) to the asymmetry of dark matter halos measured directly from the simulations and find that they agree within 1σ. We then fit our model to the wp(rp) results from Zehavi et al. and compare halo parameters. We show that our model accurately retrieves the halo asymmetry and other halo parameters. Additionally, we find 2%–6% differences between the halo masses ( and logM1) estimated by our model and those estimated by “classical” HOD models. The model proposed in this paper can serve as an alternative to multiparameter HOD models, since it can be used for relatively small samples of galaxies.

<title>Turbulence, and Proton and Electron Heating Rates in the Solar Corona: Analytical Approach</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Analytical solutions for 2D and slab turbulence energies in the solar corona are presented, including a derivation of the corresponding correlation lengths, with implications for the proton and electron temperatures in the solar corona. These solutions are derived by solving the transport equations for 2D and slab turbulence energies and their correlation lengths, as well as proton and electron pressures. The solutions assume background profiles for the solar wind speed, solar wind mass density, and Alfvén velocity. Our analytical solutions can be related to those obtained from joint Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter Metis coronagraph observations, as reported in Telloni et al. We find that the solution for 2D turbulence energy in the absence of nonlinear dissipation decreases more slowly compared to the dissipative solution. The solution for slab turbulence energy with no dissipation exhibits a more rapid increase compared to the dissipative solution. The proton heating rate is found to be about 82% of the total plasma heating rate at 6.3 R⊙, which gradually decreases with increasing distance, eventually becoming ∼80% of the total plasma heating rate at ∼13 R⊙, consistent with that found by Bandyopadhyay et al. (2023). These analytical solutions provide valuable insight for our understanding of turbulence, and its effect on proton and electron heating rates, in the solar corona. We compare the numerically solved turbulent transport equations for the 2D and slab turbulence energies, correlation lengths, and proton and electron pressures with the analytical solutions, finding good agreement between them.

We report the discovery and characterization of TIC 350842552 (“Zvrk”), an apparently isolated, rapidly rotating (Prot ∼ 99 days) red giant observed by TESS in its southern Continuous Viewing Zone. The star’s fast surface rotation is independently verified by the use of p-mode asteroseismology, strong periodicity in TESS and ASAS-SN photometry, and measurements of spectroscopic rotational broadening. A two-component fit to APOGEE spectra indicates a coverage fraction of its surface features consistent with the amplitude of the photometric rotational signal. Variations in the amplitude of its photometric modulations over time suggest the evolution of its surface morphology and therefore enhanced magnetic activity. We further develop and deploy new asteroseismic techniques to characterize radial differential rotation, but find at best only weak evidence for rotational shear within Zvrk’s convective envelope. This high surface rotation rate is incompatible with models of angular-momentum transport in single-star evolution. Spectroscopic abundance estimates also indicate a high lithium abundance, among other chemical anomalies. Taken together, all of these suggest a planet-ingestion scenario for the formation of this rotational configuration, various models for which we examine in detail.

The circumstellar disks show near/far-side asymmetry in continuum emission, indicating dust settling processes. CO isotopologue spectral analysis reveals outflows from both sources and likely from the circumbinary structure.

Young protostellar binary systems, with expected ages less than ∼105 yr, are little modified since birth, providing key clues to binary formation and evolution. We present a first look at the young, Class 0 binary protostellar system R CrA IRAS 32 from the Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks ALMA large program, which observed the system in the 1.3 mm continuum emission, 12CO (2−1), 13CO (2−1), C18O (2−1), SO (65−54), and nine other molecular lines that trace disks, envelopes, shocks, and outflows. With a continuum resolution of ∼0.″03 (∼5 au, at a distance of 150 pc), we characterize the newly discovered binary system with a separation of 207 au, their circumstellar disks, and a circumbinary disklike structure. The circumstellar disk radii are 26.9 ± 0.3 and 22.8 ± 0.3 au for sources A and B, respectively, and their circumstellar disk dust masses are estimated as 22.5 ± 1.1 M⊕ and 12.4 ± 0.6 M⊕, respectively. The circumstellar disks and the circumbinary structure have well-aligned position angles and inclinations, indicating formation in a smooth, ordered process such as disk fragmentation. In addition, the circumstellar disks have a near/far-side asymmetry in the continuum emission, suggesting that the dust has yet to settle into a thin layer near the midplane. Spectral analysis of CO isotopologues reveals outflows that originate from both of the sources and possibly from the circumbinary disklike structure. Furthermore, we detect Keplerian rotation in the 13CO isotopologues toward both circumstellar disks and likely Keplerian rotation in the circumbinary structure; the latter suggests that it is probably a circumbinary disk.

<br />总结:
本研究利用CIGALE和UltraNest对14个本地超亮红外星系（ULIRG）的光谱能量分布进行了建模分析，同时讨论了25个星暴星系的全球天体物理性质。研究发现，总和非热的1.4和4.8 GHz射电辐射可以很好地估计最近的SFR，而4.8 GHz的热射电辐射是最近星形成的更好的迹象。此外，热射电辐射的4.8 GHz比1.4 GHz对最近的星形成更敏感。文章还指出，建模的非热射电谱指数与红移、恒星质量、SFR、特定SFR和尘埃质量之间没有明显相关性。 <div>
We present detailed spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling of 14 local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) with outstanding photometric data from the literature covering the ultraviolet–infrared (FIR) and radio bands (∼50 MHz to ∼30 GHz). We employ the CIGALE SED fitting code to model the ultraviolet–FIR–radio SED. For the radio-only SED modeling, we use the UltraNest package, leveraging its nested sampling algorithm. Combining the results from our previous study on 11 luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs), we discuss the global astrophysical properties of a sample of 25 starburst galaxies (z < 0.5). Their radio spectra are frequently characterized by bends and turnovers, with no indication of ULIRGs exhibiting more complicated SEDs than LIRGs despite showing more signs of interactions. Including radio measurements in the CIGALE modeling constrained the dust luminosity and star formation rate (SFR) estimates by more than 1 order of magnitude better than previously reported for starburst galaxies. We show that total and nonthermal radio luminosity at 1.4 and 4.8 GHz frequencies can be good estimators of recent SFRs for all LIRGs and those ULIRGS with an insignificant influence of active galactic nuclei. A weaker but still significant correlation is observed between radio SFRs at 1.4 GHz and old (averaged over 100 Myr) SFRs based on SED modeling, indicative of multiple episodes of starburst activity during their lifetime. The thermal radio luminosity at 4.8 GHz is a better tracer of recent star formation than the thermal luminosity at 1.4 GHz. Statistically, our modeled nonthermal radio spectral indices do not significantly correlate with redshift, stellar mass, SFR, specific SFR, and dust mass.

<div> 高角分辨率成像，ALMA，原行星盘，M型星，Taurus<br /> 
总结:<br />
研究利用ALMA对Taurus中6颗M型星的盘进行了高分辨率观测，发现了盘的普遍性和多样性。所有六个盘中均探测到尘埃连续辐射，五个盘中探测到12CO，两个盘中探测到13CO。气尘盘尺寸比率范围从1.6到5.1不等。四个盘显示环和空洞，两个盘表面光滑。我们进行了辐射传递拟合，发现微米尺寸尘埃颗粒的空洞可能比毫米尺寸尘埃颗粒的空洞更小。目前，Taurus中的M型星盘显示出比早期星更高的空洞检测频率，尽管我们需要一个更完整的样本来评估子结构与恒星质量的依赖关系。 <div>
High angular resolution imaging by Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has revealed the near universality and diversity of substructures in protoplanetary disks. However, disks around M-type pre-main-sequence stars are still poorly sampled, despite the prevalence of M dwarfs in the Galaxy. Here we present high-resolution (∼50 mas, 8 au) ALMA Band 6 observations of six disks around mid-M stars in Taurus. We detect dust continuum emission in all six disks, 12CO in five disks, and 13CO line in two disks. The size ratios between gas and dust disks range from 1.6 to 5.1. The ratio of about 5 for 2M0436 and 2M0450 indicates efficient dust radial drift. Four disks show rings and cavities, and two disks are smooth. The cavity sizes occupy a wide range: 60 au for 2M0412, and ∼10 au for 2M0434, 2M0436, and 2M0508. Detailed visibility modeling indicates that small cavities of 1.7 and 5.7 au may hide in the two smooth disks 2M0450 and CIDA 12. We perform radiative transfer fitting of the infrared spectral energy distributions to constrain the cavity sizes, finding that micron-sized dust grains may have smaller cavities than millimeter grains. Planet–disk interactions are the preferred explanation to produce the large 60 au cavity, while other physics could be responsible for the three ∼10 au cavities under current observations and theories. Currently, disks around mid- to late M stars in Taurus show a higher detection frequency of cavities than earlier-type stars, although a more complete sample is needed to evaluate any dependence of substructure on stellar mass.

总结:<br />
这篇论文对巴纳德星进行了详细的光谱分析，比较了加拿大-法国-夏威夷望远镜/SPIRou拍摄的高质量近红外光谱和PHOENIX-ACES恒星大气模型。作者发现观测光谱中有成千上万条模型中未识别的光谱线，同时也有大量观测数据中未出现在模型中的光谱线。文章讨论了连续体不匹配、未解决的污染和光谱线偏离预期波长的问题，并提出了新的方法用于确定恒星的有效温度和金属丰度。最终得出了巴纳德星的有效温度和15种元素的丰度，强调了需要改进当前的大气模型以充分利用近红外光谱进行化学光谱分析。 <div>
Determination of fundamental parameters of stars impacts all fields of astrophysics, from galaxy evolution to constraining the internal structure of exoplanets. This paper presents a detailed spectroscopic analysis of Barnard’s star (otherwise known as Gl 699) that compares an exceptionally high-quality (an average signal-to-noise ratio of ∼1000 in the entire domain), high-resolution near-infrared (NIR) spectrum taken with Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope/SPIRou to PHOENIX-ACES stellar atmosphere models. The observed spectrum shows thousands of lines not identified in the models with a similarly large number of lines present in the model but not in the observed data. We also identify several other caveats, such as continuum mismatch, unresolved contamination, and spectral lines significantly shifted from their expected wavelengths; all of these can be a source of bias for the determination of abundance. Out of >104 observed lines in the NIR that could be used for chemical spectroscopy, we identify a short list of a few hundred lines that are reliable. We present a novel method for determining the effective temperature (Teff) and overall metallicity of slowly rotating M dwarfs that uses several groups of lines as opposed to bulk spectral fitting methods. With this method, we infer Teff = 3231 ± 21 K for Barnard's star, consistent with the value of 3238 ± 11 K inferred from the interferometric method. We also provide measurements of the abundance of 15 different elements for Barnard's star, including the abundances of four elements (K, O, Y, Th) never reported before for this star. This work emphasizes the need to improve current atmosphere models to fully exploit the NIR domain for chemical spectroscopy analysis.

2017–2022年间，我们对M31N 2008-12a经常性新星的喷发进行了光学、紫外和软X射线观测。我们在峰值附近的V和R波段光变曲线中发现了一个尖峰特征，可能与喷流有关。根据Hα发射线的形态动力学建模，我们推断新星喷发物质具有延展的双极喷流结构。光谱建模表明，每次喷发的喷射物质质量为10^-7–10^-8M⊙，并且含有增强的氦丰度。超软X射线源阶段显示出显著的变化，与紫外辐射呈反相关，表明二者可能有共同的起源。这种变化可能是由于吸积盘的重新形成。根据喷发间的复发周期，我们推断吸积速率稳步减少。将吸积速率与不同模型进行比较后，得出M31N 2008-12a的CO白矮星质量大于1.36M⊙，并随时间增长，使其成为Ia型超新星前体的单重变星场景的强有力候选者。<br /><br />总结:本研究对M31N 2008-12a的喷发进行了多波段观测，并发现了喷流相关的特征。根据Hα发射线的形态动力学建模，推断出了新星喷发物质的双极喷流结构。光谱建模显示出喷发物质的质量和氦丰度的增强。此外，超软X射线源阶段表现出显著的变化，并与紫外辐射呈现反相关关系，推测这种变化可能是由于吸积盘的重新形成。研究还推断出吸积速率稳步减少，并得出M31N 2008-12a的CO白矮星质量大于1.36M⊙，这使其成为Ia型超新星前体的单重变星场景的强有力候选者。 <div>
We report the optical, UV, and soft X-ray observations of the 2017–2022 eruptions of the recurrent nova M31N 2008-12a. We find a cusp feature in the - and -band light curves close to the peak, which could be related to jets. The geometry of the nova ejecta based on morpho-kinematic modeling of the Hα emission line indicates an extended jet-like bipolar structure. Spectral modeling indicates an ejecta mass of 10−7–10−8M⊙ during each eruption and an enhanced helium abundance. The supersoft source phase shows significant variability, which is anticorrelated to the UV emission, indicating a common origin. The variability could be due to the reformation of the accretion disk. We infer a steady decrease in the accretion rate over the years based on the intereruption recurrence period. A comparison of the accretion rate with different models on the plane yields the mass of a CO white dwarf, powering the H-shell flashes every ∼1 yr, to be >1.36 M⊙ and growing with time, making M31N 2008-12a a strong candidate for the single degenerate scenario of the Type Ia supernovae progenitor.

这篇文章介绍了磁场在星系中的重要性以及现有观测方法。通过对模拟星系进行合成观测，发现射电辐射和远红外偏振辐射可用来测量星系中磁场的性质，区分不同的介质相，并且发现射电辐射和远红外辐射对磁场的探测尺度不同。这些发现为未来的多波段极化观测提供了启示，有助于推动我们对星系外磁场的认识。 <div>
The structure of magnetic fields in galaxies remains poorly constrained, despite the importance of magnetism in the evolution of galaxies. Radio synchrotron and far-infrared (FIR) polarization and polarimetric observations are the best methods to measure galactic scale properties of magnetic fields in galaxies beyond the Milky Way. We use synthetic polarimetric observations of a simulated galaxy to identify and quantify the regions, scales, and interstellar medium (ISM) phases probed at FIR and radio wavelengths. Our studied suite of magnetohydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations features high-resolutions (10 pc full-cell size) and multiple magnetization models. Our synthetic observations have a striking resemblance to those of observed galaxies. We find that the total and polarized radio emission extends to approximately double the altitude above the galactic disk (half-intensity disk thickness of hI radio ∼ hPI radio = 0.23 ± 0.03 kpc) relative to the total FIR and polarized emission that are concentrated in the disk midplane (hI FIR ∼ hPI FIR = 0.11 ± 0.01 kpc). Radio emission traces magnetic fields at scales of ≳300 pc, whereas FIR emission probes magnetic fields at the smallest scales of our simulations. These scales are comparable to our spatial resolution and well below the spatial resolution (<300 pc) of existing FIR polarimetric measurements. Finally, we confirm that synchrotron emission traces a combination of the warm neutral and cold neutral gas phases, whereas FIR emission follows the densest gas in the cold neutral phase in the simulation. These results are independent of the ISM magnetic field strength. The complementarity we measure between radio and FIR wavelengths motivates future multiwavelength polarimetric observations to advance our knowledge of extragalactic magnetism.

<div> 电子、太阳风、离散散射、Fokker–Planck方程、磁场聚焦
总结:
本研究探讨了离散散射机制对太阳风中超热电子群的影响，使用Fokker–Planck方程模拟了电子偏转角分布的径向演化过程，并与Solar Orbiter和Parker Solar Probe任务获取的数据进行了比较。研究发现，在模型中通过调整湍流平均自由程，可以与观测数据得到显著一致的稳态解。得到的平均自由程约为天文单位数量级，且在100 eV–1 keV能量范围内显示出较弱的依赖性。这与库仑碰撞估计值明显不同，但与低刚度太阳高能粒子事件观测的平均自由程相吻合。研究结果表明在整个日球层距离范围内都存在电子的湍流散射，由此得出了一些重要结论，包括在距离太阳较远的地方存在低库仑数区域，这为在所有距离上存在各向同性的“光晕”成分提供了自然解释——电子在这个遥远的区域内成为各向同性后再进入日球层内部。 <div>
This study explores the impact of a turbulent scattering mechanism, akin to those influencing solar and galactic cosmic rays propagating in the interplanetary medium, on the population of suprathermal electrons in the solar wind. We employ a Fokker–Planck equation to model the radial evolution of electron pitch angle distributions under the action of magnetic focusing, which moves the electrons away from isotropy, and of a diffusion process that tends to bring them back to it. We compare the steady-state solutions of this Fokker–Planck equation with data obtained from the Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe missions and find a remarkable agreement, varying the turbulent mean free path as the sole free parameter in our model. The obtained mean free paths are of the order of the astronomical unit, and display weak dependence on electron energy within the 100 eV–1 keV range. This value is notably lower than Coulomb collision estimates but aligns well with observed mean free paths of low-rigidity solar energetic particle events. The strong agreement between our model and observations leads us to conclude that the hypothesis of turbulent scattering at work on electrons at all heliospheric distances is justified. We discuss several implications, notably the existence of a low Knudsen number region at large distances from the Sun, which offers a natural explanation for the presence of an isotropic “halo” component at all distances from the Sun—electrons being isotropized in this distant region before traveling back into the inner part of the interplanetary medium.

总结: <br /><br />这篇文章讨论了日冕物质抛射（CME）的早期演化及其启动机制。研究人员通过热磁流体力学模拟发现，CME的启动包含多个物理机制，并且这些机制密切相互联系。首先是由双曲线磁通管重联所引发并推动的缓慢上升。随后，缓慢上升由于双曲线磁通管重联和环不稳定性的早期发展共同推动而持续进行。最后，快速磁重联的开始和环不稳定性的发展引起了CME的即时加速。这些结果揭示了CME启动是一个复杂的过程，牵涉到多种物理机制，因此无法仅通过单一的启动机制加以解决。 <div>
Understanding the early evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), in particular their initiation, is the key to forecasting solar eruptions and induced disastrous space weather. Although many initiation mechanisms have been proposed, a full understanding of CME initiation, which is identified as a slow rise of CME progenitors in kinematics before impulsive acceleration, remains elusive. Here, with a state-of-the-art thermal magnetohydrodynamics simulation, we determine a complete CME initiation route in which multiple mainstream mechanisms occur in sequence yet are tightly coupled. The slow rise is first triggered and driven by the developing hyperbolic flux tube (HFT) reconnection. Subsequently, the slow rise continues as driven by the coupling of the HFT reconnection and the early development of torus instability. The end of the slow rise, i.e., the onset of the impulsive acceleration, is induced by the start of the fast magnetic reconnection coupled with the torus instability. These results unveil that CME initiation is a complicated process involving multiple physical mechanisms, thus being hardly resolved by a single initiation mechanism.

Recent observations have demonstrated that very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs are capable of sustaining strong magnetic fields despite their cool and neutral atmospheres. These kilogauss field strengths are inferred based on strong, highly circularly polarized gigahertz radio emission, a consequence of the electron cyclotron maser instability. Crucially, these observations imply the existence of energetic nonthermal electron populations, associated with strong current systems, as are found in the auroral regions of the magnetized planets of the solar system. Intense auroral electron precipitation will lead to electron collisions with the H2 gas that should generate the ion . With this motivation, we targeted a sample of ultracool dwarfs, known to exhibit signatures associated with aurorae, in search of the K-band emission features of using the Keck telescopes on Maunakea. From our sample of nine objects, we found no clear indication of emission features in our low-to-medium-resolution spectra (R ∼ 3600). We also modeled the impact of an auroral electron beam on a brown dwarf atmosphere, determining the depth at which energetic beams deposit their energy and drive particle impact ionization. We find that the nondetections can be explained by electron beams of typical energies ≳2–10 keV, which penetrate deeply enough that any produced is chemically destroyed before radiating energy through its infrared transitions. Strong electron beams could further explain the lack of UV auroral detections and suggest that most or nearly all of the precipitating auroral energy must ultimately emerge as thermal emissions deep in brown dwarf atmospheres.

总结:<br /><br />这项研究报告了对著名Seyfert-2型活动星系核（AGN）NGC 4388中窄Fe Kα线和反射谱的研究。利用两次NICER监测活动中的X射线光谱总和，分隔了数年，显示了直接连续谱和反射发射的显著变化，但遮挡气体的变化很小。对NICER观测得到的光谱的拟合发现，幂律光子指数Γ与直接流量之间存在强烈的正相关性，这在未遮挡的AGN中通常观察到。对直接和反射光谱之间的反响时滞的搜索显示，主要受窄Fe Kα发射线主导，测量出约为几天的时间尺度，或约为pc的特征半径。观察到了这种暂定滞后的一个循环，但这是由于直接连续谱的突然下降而导致的，随后窄Fe Kα线的显着消失。对NGC 4388的高分辨率Chandra光谱的物理拟合测量出一个线产生半径，与暂定滞后基本一致。线型特征还倾向于一个Compton厚反射体，表明其起源可能是在盘中和/或风中的厚团块内。我们讨论了分析的优缺点以及在未来观测中测试结果的方法，并指出X射线反响滞后可能用于约束不可见光学宽线区的被遮挡Seyferts中的黑洞质量。 <div>
We report on a study of the narrow Fe Kα line and reflection spectrum in the well-known Seyfert-2 active galactic nucleus (AGN), NGC 4388. X-ray spectra summed from two extensive NICER monitoring campaigns, separated by years, show strong evidence of variation in the direct continuum and reflected emission, but only small variations in the obscuring gas. Fits to the spectra from individual NICER observations find a strong, positive correlation between the power-law photon index, Γ, and direct flux that is commonly observed in unobscured AGN. A search for a reverberation lag between the direct and reflected spectra—dominated by the narrow Fe Kα emission line—measures a timescale of days, or a characteristic radius of pc . Only one cycle of this tentative lag is observed, but it is driven by a particularly sharp drop in the direct continuum that leads to the subsequent disappearance of the otherwise prominent Fe Kα line. Physically motivated fits to high-resolution Chandra spectra of NGC 4388 measure a line production radius of , formally consistent with the tentative lag. The line profile also prefers a Compton-thick reflector, indicating an origin in the disk and/or thick clumps within a wind. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of our analysis and methods for testing our results in future observations, and we note the potential for X-ray reverberation lags to constrain black hole masses in obscured Seyferts wherein the optical broad line region is not visible.

这篇论文报道了利用ALMA在TW Hya盘中首次探测到13CN的N = 2 − 1超精细结构线，实现了该盘中12CN/13CN比值的空间分辨率测量。研究采用非局部热平衡模拟了13CN线和之前观测到的12CN线，推导出动力学温度、H2体积密度以及12CN和13CN的柱密度。研究发现H2体积密度在(4 − 10) × 107 cm−3之间，表明CN分子主要存在于盘的上层。在距离中央恒星30 < r < 80 au处，12CN/13CN比值与星际介质中的12C/13C比值相似，但与TW Hya盘中其他含碳分子（CO和HCN）的先前报告值不同。这可能是由于不同分子的不同发射层高度以及12C被优先储存在盘中心面的固态相中。这项研究揭示了盘中碳同位素分馏作用的复杂性。<br /><br />总结:

Recent measurements of carbon isotope ratios in both protoplanetary disks and exoplanet atmospheres have suggested a possible transfer of significant carbon isotope fractionation from disks to planets. For a clearer understanding of the isotopic link between disks and planets, it is important to measure the carbon isotope ratios in various species. In this paper, we present a detection of the 13CN N = 2 − 1 hyperfine lines in the TW Hya disk with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. This is the first spatially resolved detection of 13CN in disks, which enables us to measure the spatially resolved 12CN/13CN ratio for the first time. We conducted nonlocal thermal equilibrium modeling of the 13CN lines in conjunction with previously observed 12CN lines to derive the kinetic temperature, H2 volume density, and column densities of 12CN and 13CN. The H2 volume density is found to range between (4 − 10) × 107 cm−3, suggesting that CN molecules mainly reside in the disk's upper layer. The 12CN/13CN ratio is measured to be at 30 < r < 80 au from the central star, which is similar to the 12C/13C ratio in the interstellar medium. However, this value differs from the previously reported values found for other carbon-bearing molecules (CO and HCN) in the TW Hya disk. This could be self-consistently explained by different emission layer heights for different molecules combined with preferential sequestration of 12C into the solid phase toward the disk midplane. This study reveals the complexity of the carbon isotope fractionation operating in disks.

<div> 星体形成、分子云、ATLASGAL调查、紧凑配置、亚毫米阵列
总结:
星体形成区域的质量组装来源于分子云中的分层结构和不同尺度上的碎裂。本文使用亚毫米阵列的紧凑配置对ATLASGAL调查中选择的一系列不同演化状态的大质量团块的碎裂进行了研究。观测结果显示，在2″尺度或0.015-0.09 pc的物理尺度上，约60%的源显示出有限或无碎裂。还发现了几个例子，证明了亚毫米阵列检测到的核心与团块的潜在位置明显偏离，这表明初始碎裂并不会形成大量的朗格曼质量碎片。我们发现，团块中紧凑结构所占的质量分数随着源的演化而增加。还发现碎片的最大质量与母团块的辐射光度存在显著相关。这些发现表明，大质量星体形成通过团块供给的核心吸积进行，初始碎裂取决于团块的密度结构和/或磁场。 <div>
The mass assembly in star-forming regions arises from the hierarchical structure in molecular clouds in tandem with fragmentation at different scales. In this paper, we present a study of the fragmentation of massive clumps covering a range of evolutionary states, selected from the ATLASGAL survey, using the compact configuration of the Submillimeter Array. The observations reveal a wide diversity in the fragmentation properties with about 60% of the sources showing limited to no fragmentation at the 2″ scale, or a physical scale of 0.015–0.09 pc. We also find several examples where the cores detected with the Submillimeter Array are significantly offset from the clump potential, suggesting that initial fragmentation does not result in the formation of a large number of Jeans mass fragments. The fraction of the clump mass that is in compact structures is seen to increase with source evolution. We also see a significant correlation between the maximum mass of a fragment and the bolometric luminosity of the parent clump. These suggest that massive star formation proceeds through clump fed core accretion, with the initial fragmentation being dependent on the density structure of the clumps and/or magnetic fields.

<div> 关键词: 变异机制, ON 231, 光度曲线, 偏振度, X射线

总结: 
这项研究提出了一个解释ON 231不同变异现象的场景，其中喷流发射由闪耀和较不可变的组件组成，并且变异主要由激波引起，而非多普勒效应。他们对多波段光度曲线进行了相关性分析，并发现光学波段的ON 231出现了较明亮时较硬的趋势，偏振度和流量之间也有类似的关系。同时他们发现X射线发射由两个对数-抛物线函数描述的两个成分组成，可以量化地重现观察到的趋势转变。在伽玛射线波段，他们发现了对应的趋势，并认为这可以通过存在非常高能的伽马射线背景组件来解释。这项研究阐明了中间谱凝聚BL Lac天体的变异机制。 <div>
The variation mechanism of blazars is a long-standing unresolved problem. In this work, we present a scenario to explain diverse variation phenomena for ON 231, where the jet emissions are composed of the flaring and the less variable components (most probably from the post-flaring blobs), and the variation is dominated by shock-in-jet instead of the Doppler effect. We perform correlation analysis for the multiwavelength light curves and find no significant correlations. For the optical band, ON 231 exhibits a harder when brighter (HWB) trend, and the trend seems to shift at different periods. Correspondingly, the correlation between the degree of polarization and flux exhibits a V-shaped behavior, and a similar translation relation during different periods is also found. These phenomena could be understood via the superposition of the flaring component and slowly varying background component. We also find that the slopes of the HWB trend become smaller at higher flux levels, which indicates the energy-dependent acceleration processes of the radiative particles. For the X-ray band, we discover a trend transition from HWB to softer when brighter (SWB) to HWB. We consider that the X-ray emission is composed of both the synchrotron tail and the synchrotron self-Compton components, which could be described by two log-parabolic functions. By varying the peak frequency, we reproduce the observed trend transition in a quantitative manner. For the γ-ray band, we find the SWB trend, which could be explained naturally if a very-high-energy γ-ray background component exists. Our study elucidates the variation mechanism of intermediate synchrotron-peaked BL Lac objects.

该研究利用LAMOST DR9目录和GALEX UV档案数据研究了M型恒星的色球和紫外活动。色球和紫外活动指数显示了饱和和非饱和状态以及已知的活动-自转关系，与先前研究一致。FUV和NUV活动指数呈单峰分布，而Hα和Ca ii H&amp;K指数显示出明显的双峰分布。不同亚型的平滑分布表明早型（部分对流）到晚型（完全对流）M星的自转依赖型磁场。我们发现一群紫外活动高于饱和状态（log）但色球活动低的恒星，其原因尚不清楚。通过计算每颗恒星的持续宜居带和紫外宜居带，发现总样本中约70%的恒星和100光年内的40%的恒星位于这两个宜居带的重叠区，表明许多M型恒星具有潜在的宜居条件。最后，我们考察了利用中国空间站望远镜进行M型恒星的紫外活动研究的可能性。

M-type stars are crucial for stellar activity studies because they cover two types of magnetic dynamos and are particularly intriguing for habitability studies due to their abundance and long lifespans during the main-sequence stage. In this paper, we used the LAMOST DR9 catalog and the GALEX UV archive data to investigate the chromospheric and UV activities of M-type stars. All the chromospheric and UV activity indices clearly show that the saturated and unsaturated regimes, and the well-known activity–rotation relation, are consistent with previous studies. Both the FUV and NUV activity indices exhibit a single-peaked distribution, while the Hα and Ca ii H&amp;K indices show a distinct double-peaked distribution. The gap between these peaks suggests a rapid transition from a saturated population to an unsaturated one. The smoothly varying distributions of different subtypes suggest a rotation-dependent dynamo for both early-type (partly convective) to late-type (fully convective) M stars. We identified a group of stars with high UV activity above the saturation regime (log ) but low chromospheric activity, and the underlying reason is unknown. By calculating the continuously habitable zone and the UV habitable zone for each star, we found that about 70% stars in the total sample and 40% stars within 100 pc are located in the overlapping region of these two habitable zones, indicating that a number of M stars are potentially habitable. Finally, we examined the possibility of UV activity studies of M stars using the China Space Station Telescope.

<div> 关键词: 磁流体力学、Kink波、Kelvin-Helmholtz不稳定性、太阳环冠、数值模拟
总结: 
磁流体力学kink波是由于对结构化介质的扰动而自然形成的，例如，日冕环的横向震荡。研究结果表明，KHI诱导的湍流动力学包括两个阶段：首先是经典的KHI湍流层生长，然后根据经典衰减模型得出了对振动和湍流加热的准确预测；其次，主导湍流运动正在衰减，发现经典的能量衰减模型能够准确预测加热的过程。我们的研究表明，我们可以建立湍流演化的简单模型，但所产生的衰减轮廓与通常用于对抗理论和观测的线性理论不同。 <div>
Magnetohydrodynamic kink waves naturally form as a consequence of perturbations to a structured medium, for example, transverse oscillations of coronal loops. Linear theory has provided many insights into the evolution of linear oscillations, and results from these models are often applied to infer information about the solar corona from observed wave periods and damping times. However, simulations show that nonlinear kink waves can host the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (KHI), which subsequently creates turbulence in the loop, dynamics that are beyond linear models. In this paper we investigate the evolution of KHI-induced turbulence on the surface of a flux tube where a nonlinear fundamental kink mode has been excited. We control our numerical experiment so that we induce the KHI without exciting resonant absorption. We find two stages in the KHI turbulence dynamics. In the first stage, we show that the classic model of a KHI turbulent layer growing at ∝t is applicable. We adapt this model to make accurate predictions of the damping of the oscillation and turbulent heating as a consequence of the KHI dynamics. In the second stage, the now dominant turbulent motions are undergoing decay. We find that the classic model of energy decay proportional to t−2 approximately holds and provides an accurate prediction of the heating in this phase. Our results show that we can develop simple models for the turbulent evolution of a nonlinear kink wave, but the damping profiles produced are distinct from those of linear theory that are commonly used to confront theory and observations.

<div> 星形反馈；巨大分子云；大麦哲伦星云；Atacama Large Millimeter／submillimeter Array；谱聚类

总结：<br />
本研究通过对大麦哲伦星云内九个巨大分子云的12CO和13CO Atacama大型毫米／亚毫米阵列地图进行研究，发现了星形反馈对这些云的重力状态产生了影响。我们使用了分子发射分割谱聚类算法来识别离散的亚结构，“团块”，并补充了近期星形成的三个迹象。研究结果表明，这些云中存在增加的湍流现象，而湍流宽度与团块表面密度和星形活动迹象均存在相关性，暗示星体能量注入在团块的动力状态中起着重要作用。12CO团块通常比13CO团块更少地被引力束缚，随着星形活动迹象的增加，动能与引力势能比例也可能会上升。进一步的多线分析可能更好地约束这些计算中的假设。 <div>
To investigate the effects of stellar feedback on the gravitational state of giant molecular clouds (GMCs), we study 12CO and 13CO Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array maps of nine GMCs distributed throughout the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the nearest star-forming galaxy to our own. We perform noise and resolution matching on the sample, working at a common resolution of 3.″5 (0.85 pc at the LMC distance of 50 kpc), and we use the Spectral Clustering for Molecular Emission Segmentation clustering algorithm to identify discrete substructure, or “clumps.” We supplement these data with three tracers of recent star formation: 8 μm surface brightness, continuum-subtracted Hα flux, and interstellar radiation field energy density inferred from dust emission. The 12CO clumps identified cover a range of 3.6 dex in luminosity-based mass and 2.4 dex in average 8 μm surface brightness, representative of the wide range of conditions of the interstellar medium in the LMC. Our observations suggest evidence for increased turbulence in these clouds. While the turbulent linewidths are correlated with clump surface density, in agreement with previous observations, we find even better correlation with the three star formation activity tracers considered, suggesting stellar energy injection plays a significant role in the dynamical state of the clumps. The excess linewidths we measure do not appear to result from opacity broadening. 12CO clumps are found to be typically less gravitationally bound than 13CO clumps, with some evidence of the kinetic-to-gravitational potential energy ratio increasing with star formation tracers. Further multiline analysis may better constrain the assumptions made in these calculations.

<title>Exploring the Coronal Magnetic Field with Galactic Cosmic Rays: The Sun Shadow Observed by HAWC</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) are charged particles that reach the heliosphere almost isotropically in a wide energy range. In the inner heliosphere, the GCR flux is modulated by solar activity so that only energetic GCRs reach the lower layers of the solar atmosphere. In this work, we propose that high-energy GCRs can be used to explore the solar magnetic fields at low coronal altitudes. We used GCR data collected by the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov observatory to construct maps of GCR flux coming from the Sun’s sky direction and studied the observed GCR deficit, known as Sun shadow (SS), over a 6 yr period (2016–2021) with a time cadence of 27.3 days. We confirm that the SS is correlated with sunspot number, but we focus on the relationship between the photospheric solar magnetic field measured at different heliolatitudes and the relative GCR deficit at different energies. We found a linear relationship between the relative deficit of GCRs represented by the depth of the SS and the solar magnetic field. This relationship is evident in the observed energy range of 2.5–226 TeV, but is strongest in the range of 12.4 33.4 TeV, which implies that this is the best energy range to study the evolution of magnetic fields in the low solar atmosphere.

<title>Probing the Stellar Populations and Star Formation History of Early-type Galaxies at 0 < z < 1.1 in the Rest-frame Ultraviolet</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We measure the evolution of the rest-frame near-ultraviolet (NUV)−V colors for early-type galaxies in clusters at 0 < z < 1.1 using data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program, CFHT Large Area U-band Deep Survey, and local Sloan Digital Sky Survey clusters observed with Galaxy Evolution Explorer. Our results show that there is an excess in the ultraviolet spectrum in most quiescent galaxies (compared to the expectations from models fitting their optical/infrared colors and spectra) below z ∼ 0.6, beyond which the excess UV emission fades rapidly. This evolution of the UV color is only consistent with the presence of a highly evolved, hot horizontal branch subpopulation in these galaxies (among the majority of cool and optically bright stars), comprising on average 10% of the total stellar mass and forming at z > 3. The blue UV colors of early-type galaxies at low–intermediate redshifts are likely driven by this subpopulation being enriched in helium up to ∼44%. At z > 0.8 (when the extra UV component has not yet appeared) the data allow us to constrain the star formation histories of galaxies by fitting models to the evolution of their UV colors: we find that the epoch at which the stellar populations formed lies in the range 3 < zform < 10 (corresponding to 0.5–2.2 Gyr after the Big Bang) with a star formation e-folding timescale of τ = 0.35–0.7 Gyr, suggesting that these galaxies formed the majority of stars at very high redshift, with a brief yet intense burst of star formation activity. The star formation history and chemical evolution of early-type galaxies resemble those of globular clusters, albeit on much larger scales.

Galaxy cluster mergers that exhibit clear dissociation between their dark matter, intracluster gas, and stellar components are great laboratories for probing dark matter properties. Mergers that are binary and in the plane of the sky have the additional advantage of being simpler to model, allowing for a better understanding of the merger dynamics. We report the discovery of a galaxy cluster merger with all these characteristics and present a multiwavelength analysis of the system, which was found via a search in the redMaPPer optical cluster catalog. We perform a galaxy redshift survey to confirm the two subclusters are at the same redshift (0.541, with 368 ± 519 km s−1 line-of-sight velocity difference between them). The X-ray morphology shows two surface brightness peaks between the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). We construct weak-lensing mass maps that reveal a mass peak associated with each subcluster. Fitting Navarro–Frenk–White profiles to the lensing data, we find masses of M200c = 36 ± 11 × 1013 and 38 ± 11 × 1013M⊙h−1 for the southern and northern subclusters, respectively. From the mass maps, we infer that the two mass peaks are separated by kpc along the merger axis, whereas the two BCGs are separated by 697 kpc. We also present deep GMRT 650 MHz data to search for a radio relic or halo and find none. Using the observed merger parameters, we find analog systems in cosmological n-body simulations and infer that this system is observed between 96 and 236 Myr after pericenter, with the merger axis within 28° of the plane of the sky.

<title>Unusually Low-frequency Whistler-mode Waves and Their Association with High-energy Protons Observed Upstream of Martian Bow Shock</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Whistler-mode waves upstream of planetary bow shock are often referred to as “1-Hz waves” due to the center of their observed frequency range being at ∼1 Hz. A series of whistler-mode waves were observed upstream of the Martian bow shock by MAVEN on 2015 August 14, with unusually low frequencies centered at ∼0.4 Hz. These waves were accompanied (though not synchronized) by the significant flux enhancement of high-energy protons up to ∼10 keV. By analyzing the wave dispersion property and the wave–particle interaction condition, we find that the observed whistler-mode waves have the potential of resonating with protons of ∼1 keV with large pitch angles up to nearly perpendicular to the background magnetic field, thereby providing a feasible means of accounting for proton acceleration. Our results indicate the possible origin of energized protons in the Martian environment through the interaction with whistler-mode waves, and their potential relationship with the unique upstream conditions.

<title>A Consistent Explanation for the Unusual Initial Mass Function and Star Formation Rate in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ)</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad33c0</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad33c0</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We examine various physical processes that may explain the shallow high-mass slope of the initial mass function (IMF), as well as the low star formation rate (SFR) in star-forming molecular clouds (MCs) in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). We show that the strong tidal field and shear experienced by the CMZ have opposite effects on the collapse of density fluctuations and cannot explain these properties. Similarly, we show that the intense magnetic field in the CMZ provides a negligible pressure support and, for the high densities at play, should not modify the probability density function of the turbulent gas flow, thus affecting negligibly the IMF. However, we show that, in contrast to the MCs in the Galactic disk, the ones in the CMZ experience only one single episode of turbulence cascade. Indeed, their rather short lifetime, due to their high mean densities, is similar to one typical turbulence crossing time. Consequently, according to the Hennebelle–Chabrier theory of star formation, within this “single turbulence cascade episode,” the cloud experiences one single field of turbulence-induced density fluctuations, leading eventually to gravitationally unstable cores. As shown in Hennebelle & Chabrier (2013), this yields a shallower IMF than usual and leads to the correct observed slope for the CMZ star-forming clouds. Similarly, this single large-scale turbulence event within the cloud lifetime yields a 5–6 times lower SFR than under usual conditions, in agreement with the observed values. Therefore, we suggest that this “single turbulence cascade” scenario can explain both the shallow IMF and low SFR of clouds in the CMZ.

<title>Magnetic Flux Plays an Important Role during a Black Hole X-Ray Binary Outburst in Radiative Two-temperature General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations</title>

Black hole (Bh) X-ray binaries cycle through different spectral states of accretion over the course of months to years. Although persistent changes in the Bh mass accretion rate are generally recognized as the most important component of state transitions, it is becoming increasingly evident that magnetic fields play a similarly important role. In this article, we present the first radiative two-temperature general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations in which an accretion disk transitions from a quiescent state at an accretion rate of to a hard-intermediate state at an accretion rate of . This huge parameter space in mass accretion rate is bridged by artificially rescaling the gas density scale of the simulations. We present two jetted BH models with varying degrees of magnetic flux saturation. We demonstrate that in “standard and normal evolution” models, which are unsaturated with magnetic flux, the hot torus collapses into a thin and cold accretion disk when . On the other hand, in “magnetically arrested disk” models, which are fully saturated with vertical magnetic flux, the plasma remains mostly hot with substructures that condense into cold clumps of gas when . This suggests that the spectral signatures observed during state transitions are closely tied to the level of magnetic flux saturation.

<title>Phase and Morphology of Water-ice Grains Formed in a Cryogenic Laboratory Plasma</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Grains of ice are formed spontaneously when water vapor is injected into a weakly ionized laboratory plasma in which the background gas has been cooled to cryogenic temperatures comparable to those of deep space. These ice grains are levitated indefinitely within the plasma so that their time evolution can be observed under free-floating conditions. Using microscope imaging, ice grains are shown to have a spindle-like fractal structure and grow over time. Both crystalline and amorphous phases of ice are observed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. A mix of crystalline and amorphous grains coexists under certain thermal conditions, and a linear mixing model is used on the ice absorption band surrounding 3.2 μm to examine the ice phase composition and its temporal stability. The extinction spectrum is also affected by inelastic scattering as grains grow, and characteristic grain radii are obtained from Mie scattering theory and compared to size measurements from direct imaging. Observations are used to compare possible ice nucleation mechanisms, and it is concluded that nucleation is likely catalyzed by ions, as ice does not nucleate in the absence of plasma and impurities are not detected. Ice grain properties and infrared extinction spectra show similarity to observations of some astrophysical ices observed in protoplanetary disks, implying that the fractal morphology of the ice and observed processes of homogeneous ice nucleation could occur as well in such astrophysical environments with weakly ionized conditions.

<title>The Relativistic Spin Precession in the Compact Double Neutron Star System PSR J1946+2052</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We observe systematic profile changes in the visible pulsar of the compact double neutron star system PSR J1946+2052 using observations with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The interpulse of PSR J1946+2052 changed from a single-peak to a double-peak shape from 2018–2021. We attribute this evolution as the result of the relativistic spin precession of the pulsar. With the high sensitivity of FAST, we also measure significant polarization for the first time, allowing us to model this with the precessional rotating vector model. Assuming, to the first order, a circular hollow-cone-like emission beam pattern and taking the validity of general relativity (GR), we derive the binary’s orbital inclination angle ( ) and pulsar’s spin geometry. The pulsar’s spin vector and the orbital angular momentum vector are found to be only slightly misaligned ( ). The quoted uncertainties do not reflect the systematic uncertainties introduced by our model assumptions. By simulating future observations of profile and polarization evolution, we estimate that we could constrain the precession rate within a 43% uncertainty in 9 yr. Hence, we suggest that the system’s profile evolution could be combined with precise pulsar timing to test GR in the future.

<div> 关键词: 太阳-作为-恒星，太阳耀斑， CHASE，Hα光谱，光谱特征
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了X1.0级太阳耀斑的太阳-作为-恒星的光谱特征。研究使用了中国Hα太阳探测器获取的高分辨率光谱数据，并采用基于离散傅立叶变换的噪声减少算法增强了空间积分Hα光谱的信噪比。研究发现，耀斑的平均Hα轮廓表现出线心的强发射和明显的线增宽，还呈现出明显的红偏斜，对应着约50 km/s的红移速度，随时间略有减小，与先前的结果一致。此外，研究还发现，空间积分区域的大小对耀斑太阳-作为-恒星Hα轮廓特征的影响。研究估计了检测到红偏斜的适用区域的上限。同时，研究还发现，如果进一步在时间域内对Hα光谱进行平均，那么光谱的等效宽度的强度会被显著低估。 <div>
Sun-as-a-star spectroscopic characteristics of solar flares can be used as a benchmark for the detection and analysis of stellar flares. Here, we study the Sun-as-a-star properties of an X1.0 solar flare, using high-resolution spectroscopic data obtained by the Chinese Hα Solar Explorer (CHASE). A noise reduction algorithm based on discrete Fourier transformation is first employed to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the space-integral Hα spectrum, with a focus on its typical characteristics. For the flare of interest, we find that the average Hα profile displays a strong emission at the line center and an obvious line broadening. It also presents a clear red asymmetry, corresponding to a redshift velocity of around 50 km s−1 that slightly decreases with time, consistent with previous results. Furthermore, we study how the size of the space-integral region affects the characteristics of the flare's Sun-as-a-star Hα profile. It is found that although the redshift velocity calculated from the Hα profile remains unchanged, the detectability of the characteristics weakens as the space-integral region becomes larger. An upper limit on the size of the target region where the red asymmetry is detectable is estimated. It is also found that the intensity in Hα profiles, measured by the equivalent widths of the spectra, are significantly underestimated if the Hα spectra are further averaged in the time domain.

<div> 关键词: 太阳系，热木星，撞击，大气成分，化学变化<br />
总结: <br />
本研究调查了彗星撞击如何影响热木星的大气组成和化学性质。他们使用参数化的彗星撞击模型和大气模型，发现即使是小型撞击体也能导致大气化学成分的显著短期改变，包括水、CO和CO2丰度的大幅增加，以及可观察的碳氢化合物（如CH4）几乎完全消失。这些效应与大气C/O比和金属丰度的改变成比例。因此，彗星撞击可能显著改变热木星的大气组成，可能会打破大气C/O比与行星形成位置之间的联系。 <div>
Impacts from icy and rocky bodies have helped shape the composition of Solar System objects; for example, the Earth–Moon system, or the recent impact of comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter. It is likely that such impacts also shape the composition of exoplanetary systems. Here, we investigate how cometary impacts might affect the atmospheric composition/chemistry of hot Jupiters, which are prime targets for characterization. We introduce a parameterized cometary impact model that includes thermal ablation and pressure driven breakup, which we couple with the 1D “radiative-convective” atmospheric model ATMO, including disequilibrium chemistry. We use this model to investigate a wide range of impactor masses and compositions, including those based on observations of Solar System comets, and interstellar ices (with JWST). We find that even a small impactor (R = 2.5 km) can lead to significant short-term changes in the atmospheric chemistry, including a factor >10 enhancement in H2O, CO, and CO2 abundances, as well as atmospheric opacity more generally, and the near-complete removal of observable hydrocarbons, such as CH4, from the upper atmosphere. These effects scale with the change in atmospheric C/O ratio and metallicity. Potentially observable changes are possible for a body that has undergone significant/continuous bombardment, such that the global atmospheric chemistry has been impacted. Our works reveals that cometary impacts can significantly alter or pollute the atmospheric composition/chemistry of hot Jupiters. These changes have the potential to mute/break the proposed link between atmospheric C/O ratio and planet formation location relative to key snowlines in the natal protoplanetary disk.

We present deep XMM-Newton, Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, and upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope observations of Abell 746, a cluster that hosts a plethora of diffuse emission sources that provide evidence for the acceleration of relativistic particles. Our new XMM-Newton images reveal a complex morphology of the thermal gas with several substructures. We observe an asymmetric temperature distribution across the cluster: the southern regions exhibit higher temperatures, reaching ∼9 keV, while the northern regions have lower temperatures (≤4 keV), likely due to a complex merger. We find evidence of three surface brightness edges and one candidate edge, of which three are merger-driven shock fronts. Combining our new data with published LOw-Frequency ARray observations has unveiled the nature of diffuse sources in this system. The bright NW relic shows thin filaments and a high degree of polarization with aligned magnetic field vectors. We detect a density jump, aligned with the fainter relic to the north. To the south, we detect high-temperature regions, consistent with the shock-heated regions and a density jump coincident with the northern tip of the southern radio structure. Its integrated spectrum shows a high-frequency steepening. Lastly, we find that the cluster hosts large-scale radio halo emission. A comparison of the thermal and nonthermal emission reveals an anticorrelation between the bright radio and X-ray features at the center. Our findings suggest that Abell 746 is a complex system that involves multiple mergers.

<title>The Heavy Metal Survey: Star Formation Constraints and Dynamical Masses of 21 Massive Quiescent Galaxies at z = 1.3–2.3</title>

<div> 高红移星系、重金属调查、质量动力学、恒星形成、质量增长<br />总结:<br />这篇论文介绍了重金属调查项目，通过对21个质量巨大的静止星系进行深入观测，成功获取了它们的光谱红移和恒星速度分散度等信息。研究发现，大多数星系呈现出质量动力学质量与恒星质量之比和恒星速度分散度之间强烈的相关性，暗示着初始质量函数可能在宇宙早期就已经存在差异。对于遥远的静止星系的观测结果，也暗示了它们不会简单地在今天的巨型早期星系内部持续增长，其演化过程更为复杂。 <div>
In this paper, we present the Heavy Metal Survey, which obtained ultradeep medium-resolution spectra of 21 massive quiescent galaxies at 1.3 < z < 2.3 with Keck/LRIS and MOSFIRE. With integration times of up to 16 hr per band per galaxy, we observe numerous Balmer and metal absorption lines in atmospheric windows. We successfully derive spectroscopic redshifts for all 21 galaxies, and for 19 we also measure stellar velocity dispersions (σv), ages, and elemental abundances, as detailed in an accompanying paper. Except for one emission-line active galactic nucleus, all galaxies are confirmed as quiescent through their faint or absent Hα emission and evolved stellar spectra. For most galaxies exhibiting faint Hα, elevated [N ii]/Hα suggests a non-star-forming origin. We calculate dynamical masses (Mdyn) by combining σv with structural parameters obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope COSMOS(-DASH) survey and compare them with stellar masses (M*) derived using spectrophotometric modeling, considering various assumptions. For a fixed initial mass function (IMF), we observe a strong correlation between Mdyn/M* and σv. This correlation may suggest that a varying IMF, with high-σv galaxies being more bottom heavy, was already in place at z ∼ 2. When implementing the σv-dependent IMF found in the cores of nearby early-type galaxies and correcting for biases in our stellar mass and size measurements, we find a low scatter in Mdyn/M* of 0.14 dex. However, these assumptions result in unphysical stellar masses, which exceed the dynamical masses by 34%. This tension suggests that distant quiescent galaxies do not simply grow inside-out into today’s massive early-type galaxies and the evolution is more complicated.

<div> 关键词: galaxy samples, density field reconstruction, power spectrum, emulator, cosmological parameters<br />
总结:<br />文章研究了使用密度场重构来恢复宇宙中小尺度线性信息的方法，提出了一个准确的模拟器，用于模拟预重构、后重构和交叉功率谱，以提高宇宙学参数的约束。研究表明，联合分析前后重构的功率谱可以有效提取高阶统计信息。相比仅使用前重构的功率谱，使用联合功率谱可以显著改善对宇宙学参数和BAO/RSD参数的约束，突显了联合分析的高效性和实用性。 <div>
The small-scale linear information in galaxy samples typically lost during nonlinear growth can be restored to a certain level by the density field reconstruction, which has been demonstrated for improving the precision of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements. As proposed in the literature, a joint analysis of the power spectrum before and after the reconstruction enables an efficient extraction of information carried by high-order statistics. However, the statistics of the postreconstruction density field are difficult to model. In this work, we circumvent this issue by developing an accurate emulator for the prereconstructed, postreconstructed, and cross-power spectra ( , Ppost, Pcross) up to k = 0.5 h Mpc−1 based on the Dark QuestN-body simulations. The accuracy of the emulator is at the percent level; namely, the error of the emulated monopole and quadrupole of the power spectra is less than 1% and 10% of the ground truth, respectively. A fit to an example power spectrum using the emulator shows that the constraints on cosmological parameters get largely improved using +Ppost+Pcross with , compared to that derived from alone; namely, the constraints on (Ωm, H0, σ8) are tightened by ∼41%–55%, and the uncertainties of the derived BAO and RSD parameters (α⊥, α∣∣, fσ8) shrink by ∼28%–54%, respectively. This highlights the complementarity among , Ppost, and Pcross, which demonstrates the efficiency and practicability of a joint , Ppost, and Pcross analysis for cosmological implications.

<div> pulsar, emission geometry, jitter noise, plasma flow, MSPs
总结:<br /><br />该研究调查了17颗毫秒脉冲星(MSPs)的排放几何参数与抖动噪声之间的关系。通过假设抖动噪声仅由相位脉冲变化引起，前者可以被建模为等离子体流速的变化，导致相对于预测时间的脉冲到达时间的变化。在多种排放状态的脉冲星磁层模型中，等离子体流速与排放状态相关联，而排放状态的改变对应于等离子体流速的变化，引起脉冲到达时间的变化。我们计算出每颗MSP报道的抖动噪声对排放状态的最大改变。利用结果，我们发现MSPs具有相对较大的斜率角，这与观测结果一致，并且抖动噪声表现出对频率的依赖性。我们发现样本中的抖动噪声显示出指数衰减的特性，这个特性结合了斜率角和旋转周期，揭示了这三个参数之间的相关性。这表明抖动噪声的大小可能是特定于MSPs的。我们讨论了抖动噪声如何与MSP的演化有关。 <div>
The relationships between several parameters of an emission geometry and jitter noise in 17 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are investigated. By assuming the jitter noise is due only to a pulse variation in phase, the former can be modeled as changes in the plasma flow rate leading to variation in the measured pulse arrival time relative to the predicted time. In the model for pulsar magnetospheres with multiple emission states, the plasma flow is associated with the emission states, and a change in the emission state corresponds to a change in the plasma flow causing variation in the pulse arrival time. These can be specified in an emission geometry defined by the obliquity and viewing angles, measured from the rotation axis to the magnetic axis and to the line of sight, respectively. We calculate the maximum change in the emission state based on the reported jitter noise for each of the MSPs. Using the results, we show that the MSPs possess relatively large obliquity angles, which is consistent with observation, and the jitter noise exhibits dependency on frequency. We find that the jitter noise in our sample displays an exponential decay as a function that combines the obliquity angle and the rotation period, revealing the correlation among the three parameters. This suggests that the magnitude of the jitter noise is likely specific to an MSP. We discuss how jitter noise may be related to the evolution of an MSP.

<div> starburst galaxy, supernova feedback, outflow, cooling, covering fraction

总结: 这篇文章研究了星暴星系中的超新星反馈对星系中气体流动的影响。作者在10kpc尺度上进行了高分辨率模拟，并发现星暴区域中的超新星驱动的气体流动更加热，速度更快，含有更多的冷相气体，而星系范围内的超新星驱动气体流动效果更好，可以更有效地清除盘面上的冷气体。这些研究结果有助于更好地理解星暴星系中的物理过程。 <div>
We present the fifth simulation in the Cholla Galactic OutfLow Simulation (CGOLS) project—a set of isolated starburst galaxy simulations modeled over large scales (10 kpc) at uniformly high resolution (Δx ≈ 5 pc). Supernova feedback in this simulation is implemented as a disk-wide distribution of clusters, and we assess the impact of this geometry on several features of the resulting outflow, including the radial profiles of various phases; mass, momentum, and energy outflow rates; covering fraction of cool gas; mock absorption-line spectra; and X-ray surface brightness. In general, we find that the outflow generated by this model is cooler, slower, and contains more mass in the cool phase than a more centrally concentrated outflow driven by a similar number of supernovae. In addition, the energy loading factors in the hot phase are an order of magnitude lower, indicating much larger losses due to radiative cooling in the outflow. However, coupling between the hot and cool phases is more efficient than in the nuclear burst case, with almost 50% of the total outflowing energy flux carried by the cool phase at a radial distance of 5 kpc. These physical differences have corresponding signatures in observable quantities: the covering fraction of cool gas is much larger, and there is greater evidence of absorption in low and intermediate ionization energy lines. Taken together, our simulations indicate that centrally concentrated starbursts are more effective at driving hot, low-density outflows that will expand far into the halo, while galaxy-wide bursts may be more effective at removing cool gas from the disk.

The Hercules ultrafaint dwarf galaxy (UFD) has long been hypothesized to be tidally disrupting, yet no conclusive evidence has been found for tidal disruption owing partly to difficulties in identifying Hercules member stars. In this work, we present a homogeneous reanalysis of new and existing observations of Hercules, including the detection of a new potential member star located ∼1° (∼1.7 kpc) west of the center of the system. In addition to measuring the line-of-sight velocity gradient, we compare predictions from dynamical models of stream formation to these observations. We report an updated velocity dispersion measurement based on 28 stars, km s−1, which is significantly lower than previous measurements. We find that the line-of-sight velocity gradient is km s−1 kpc along the major axis of Hercules, consistent with zero within 1σ. Our dynamical models of stream formation, on the other hand, can reproduce the morphology of the Hercules UFD, specifically the misalignment between the elongation and the orbital motion direction. Additionally, these dynamical models indicate that any radial velocity gradient from tidal disruption would be too small, km s−1 kpc, to be detectable with current sample sizes. Combined with our analysis of the tidal radius evolution of the system as a function of its orbital phase, we argue that it is likely that Hercules is indeed currently undergoing tidal disruption in its extended stellar halo with a line-of-sight velocity gradient too small to be detected with current observational data sets.

Investigating Protostellar Accretion is a Cycle 1 JWST program using the NIRSpec+MIRI integral field units to obtain 2.9–28 μm spectral cubes of five young protostars with luminosities of 0.2–10,000 L⊙ in their primary accretion phase. This paper introduces the NIRSpec 2.9–5.3 μm data of the inner 840–9000 au with spatial resolutions from 28 to 300 au. The spectra show rising continuum emission; deep ice absorption; emission from H2, H i, and [Fe ii]; and the CO fundamental series in emission and absorption. Maps of the continuum emission show scattered light cavities for all five protostars. In the cavities, collimated jets are detected in [Fe ii] for the four <320 L⊙ protostars, two of which are additionally traced in Brα. Knots of [Fe ii] emission are detected toward the most luminous protostar, and knots of [Fe ii] emission with dynamical times of <30 yr are found in the jets of the others. While only one jet is traced in H2, knots of H2 and CO are detected in the jets of four protostars. H2 is seen extending through the cavities, showing that they are filled by warm molecular gas. Bright H2 emission is seen along the walls of a single cavity, while in three cavities narrow shells of H2 emission are found, one of which has an [Fe ii] knot at its apex. These data show cavities containing collimated jets traced in atomic/ionic gas surrounded by warm molecular gas in a wide-angle wind and/or gas accelerated by bow shocks in the jets.

<div> 关键词: TeV gamma-ray afterglow, GRB 221009A, LHAASO Collaboration, activation time, jet component<br />
总结: 通过LHAASO合作组报道的GRB 221009A的早期TeV伽马射线余辉光变曲线，可以确定主喷流组件的激活时间，了解到其大约在GBM触发时间后约200秒时发生，并紧随GBM饱和时刻。研究结果表明，虽然LHAASO的数据不能排除均匀周围介质场景，但原始风场情形更为可取，并与恒星泡大小预期非常吻合。初期光变曲线增长主要受射流内部过程或伽马-伽马吸收影响，激活加速过程或减少内部伽马-伽马吸收可以自然地解释初始快速通量增加。随后的慢通量增长阶段可与产生区域中粒子积累过程相关联。此阶段的持续时间几乎可以独立于参数地确定喷流的初始洛伦兹因子Γ0≈600和磁场强度。这些数值似乎很好地匹配先前通过GRB辐射的谱建模揭示出的数值。<br /><br /> <div>
We explore the implications of the light curve of the early TeV gamma-ray afterglow of GRB 221009A reported by the LHAASO Collaboration. We show that the reported offset of the reference time, T*, allows the determination of the activation time of the main jet component, which occurs approximately 200 s after the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) trigger time and closely precedes the moment at which GBM was saturated. We find that while the LHAASO data do not exclude the homogeneous circumburst medium scenario, the progenitor wind scenario looks preferable, finding excellent agreement with the expected size of the stellar bubble. We conclude that the initial growth of the light curve is dominated by processes internal to the jet or by gamma-gamma attenuation on the photons emitted during the prompt phase. Namely, either the activation of the acceleration process or the decrease of internal gamma-gamma absorption can naturally explain the initial rapid flux increase. The subsequent slow flux growth phase observed up to T* + 18 s can be related to the process of particle accumulation in the production region. The duration of this phase allows an almost parameter-independent determination of the jet’s initial Lorentz factor, Γ0 ≈ 600, and magnetic field strength, . These values appear to match well those previously revealed through spectral modeling of the GRB emission.

A fraction of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) with signs of interaction with a dense circumstellar matter are preceded by bright precursor emission. While the precursors are likely caused by a mass ejection before core collapse, their mechanism to power energetic bursts—sometimes reaching 1048–1049 erg, which is larger than the binding energies of red supergiant envelopes—is still under debate. Remarkably, such a huge energy deposition should result in an almost complete envelope ejection and hence a strong sign of interaction, but the observed SNe with precursors show in fact typical properties among the interacting SNe. More generally, the observed luminosity of 1040−1042 erg s−1 is shown to be challenging for a single SN progenitor. To resolve these tensions, we propose a scenario where the progenitor is in a binary system with a compact object (CO) and an outburst from the star leads to a super-Eddington accretion onto the CO. We show that for sufficiently short separations outbursts with moderate initial kinetic energies of 1046–1047 erg can be energized by the accreting CO so that their radiative output can be consistent with the observed precursors. We discuss the implications of our model in relation to CO binaries detectable with Gaia and gravitational-wave detectors.

<title>Large Fluctuations within 1 au in Protoplanetary Disks</title>

Protoplanetary disks are often assumed to change slowly and smoothly during planet formation. Here, we investigate the time evolution of isolated disks subject to viscosity and a disk wind. The viscosity is assumed to increase rapidly at around 900 K due to thermal ionization of alkali metals, or thermionic and ion emission from dust, and the onset of magnetorotational instability (MRI). The disks generally undergo large, rapid fluctuations for a wide range of time-averaged mass accretion rates. Fluctuations involve coupled waves in temperature and surface density that move radially in either direction through the inner 1.5 au of the disk. Two types of waves are seen with radial speeds of roughly 50 and 1000 cm s−1, respectively. The pattern of waves repeats with a period of roughly 10,000 yr that depends weakly on the average mass accretion rate. Viscous transport due to MRI is confined to the inner disk. This region is resupplied by mass flux from the outer disk driven by the disk wind. Interior to 1 au, the temperature and surface density can vary by a factor of 2–10 on timescales of years to kiloyears. The stellar mass accretion rate varies by 3 orders of magnitude on a similar timescale. This behavior lasts for at least 1 Myr for initial disks comparable to the minimum-mass solar nebula.

<div> 关键词: Rossby waves, inertial oscillations, 3D numerical simulation, Sun's convection zone, radiative interior

总结:
Rossby波和其他惯性振荡在太阳对流层的观测燃起了人们对利用这些波来探测太阳内部的希望。研究人员通过在球形几何中建立的3D数值模拟模型，成功模拟了太阳的对流区和上部辐射内部，并观察到了多种惯性振荡，包括扇形和饼状赤道Rossby波、逆行混合惯性模式、顺行热Rossby波以及最近观测到的高频逆行（HFR）涡度模式，以及可能是这些HFR模式的纬向谐波。模拟结果表明，扇形和饼状Rossby波在辐射内部和对流层中是普遍存在的。研究人员认为，在模拟中，在辐射内部和对流区存在两种不同的Rossby波系列。最后，研究人员认为，出现在对流区的许多逆行惯性波，包括HFR模式，实际上都是相关的，是与顺行热Rossby波混合的纬向谐波。 <br /><br /> <div>
Recent observations of Rossby waves and other more exotic forms of inertial oscillations in the Sun’s convection zone have kindled the hope that such waves might be used as a seismic probe of the Sun's interior. Here, we present a 3D numerical simulation in spherical geometry that models the Sun’s convection zone and upper radiative interior. This model features a wide variety of inertial oscillations, including both sectoral and tesseral equatorial Rossby waves, retrograde mixed inertial modes, prograde thermal Rossby waves, the recently observed high-frequency retrograde (HFR) vorticity modes, and what may be latitudinal overtones of these HFR modes. With this model, we demonstrate that sectoral and tesseral Rossby waves are ubiquitous within the radiative interior as well as within the convection zone. We suggest that there are two different Rossby-wave families in this simulation that live in different wave cavities: one in the radiative interior and one in the convection zone. Finally, we suggest that many of the retrograde inertial waves that appear in the convection zone, including the HFR modes, are in fact all related, being latitudinal overtones that are mixed modes with the prograde thermal Rossby waves.

总结: <br /><br />这篇文章报告了利用CHIME对三个二元脉冲星的观测结果。研究人员首次在所有三个脉冲星二元系统中探测到了Shapiro时间延迟，并且利用2-4年的CHIME/脉冲定时数据测量了它们的质量。他们还通过观测轨道前进量，精确估计了PSR J1518+4904的伴星质量，以及PSR J2023+2853的伴星可能是高质量白矮星。研究人员还发现PSR J0218+4232的观测轨道周期有显著变化，由此推断了该系统的距离。这项工作展示了CHIME/脉冲系统通过高频率观测，可以在短时间内探测和精确测量二元脉冲星的广义相对论效应。 <div>
We performed near-daily observations of the binary pulsars PSR J0218+4232, PSR J1518+4904, and PSR J2023+2853 with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME). For the first time, we detected the Shapiro time delay in all three pulsar binary systems, using only 2–4 yr of CHIME/Pulsar timing data. We measured the pulsar masses to be M⊙, M⊙, and M⊙, respectively. The companion mass to PSR J0218+4232 was found to be M⊙. We constrained the mass of the neutron star companion of PSR J1518+4904 to be M⊙, using the observed apsidal motion as a constraint on the mass estimation. The binary companion to PSR J2023+2853 was found to have a mass of M⊙; in the context of the near-circular orbit, this mass estimate suggests that the companion to PSR J2023+2853 is likely a high-mass white dwarf. By comparing the timing model obtained for PSR J0218+4232 with previous observations, we found a significant change in the observed orbital period of the system of ; we determined that this variation arises from “Shklovskii acceleration” due to the relative motion of the binary system, and used this measurement to estimate a distance of d = (6.7 ± 1.0) kpc to PSR J0218+4232. This work demonstrates the capability of high-cadence observations, enabled by the CHIME/Pulsar system, to detect and refine general-relativistic effects of binary pulsars over short observing timescales.

总结:
本文研究了本地集团中十个矮星系的星体形成历史(SFH)，使用了近红外颜色-颜色图和盖亚测距数据，去除了前景矮星，得到了包括红超巨星和半渐近巨星分支星的样本。通过颜色-星等图拟合方法，使用帕多瓦等时线生成模型来测量SFH，并确定了这十个矮星系的星体形成率、距离模数和金属丰度。结果表明，矮星不规则星系的星体形成率呈缓慢增长趋势，而矮椭圆星系的星体形成率从过去到现在呈缓慢下降趋势，同时表明NGC 6822的SFH显示出明显的增长特征，揭示了相互作用事件触发的星体形成活动。这些研究有助于我们更好地理解星系演化和恒星物理。 <div>
The star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies provide valuable insights into galaxy evolution and stellar physics. Understanding the SFHs enables the study of chemical enrichment of galaxies, star formation triggered by interactions, and the behavior of various stellar populations. This work investigates the SFHs of ten dwarf galaxies in the Local Group (LG), which spans a wide range of types, masses, luminosities, and metallicities. The analysis is based on our new sample of the member stars in the LG after removing foreground dwarf stars by using information from the near-infrared color–color diagram and Gaia astrometry. The sample includes the most complete and pure red supergiants and asymptotic giant branch stars to gain valuable insights into the recent SFHs of the galaxies. A fitting method based on the color–magnitude diagram (CMD) is introduced to measure the SFH. The Padova isochrones are used to generate initial model CMDs, accounting for photometric errors and completeness through star-field simulations to match the completeness and error distributions of the observed CMDs. Subsequently, the SFHs, distance modulus, and metallicity of the ten dwarf galaxies are determined by fitting the CMDs. The results indicate that the star formation rates of dwarf irregulars show a gradual increase, while those of dwarf ellipticals exhibit a gradual decrease from the past to the present. Furthermore, this work shows that the star formation activity in dwarf ellipticals persisted up to 30 Myr ago. A significant increasing feature in the SFH of NGC 6822 reveals star formation activity triggered by an interaction event.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了恒星星冠物质抛射对外行星居住条件的影响，并提出了使用光谱线的不对称性来探测恒星CME的方法。通过构建CME的解析模型，作者推导了恒星爆发时的极紫外线线谱轮廓，进一步研究了探测器参数、曝光时间、CME传播方向和恒星活动水平对线谱轮廓的影响。研究结果表明，利用极紫外光谱仪可以在中等光谱分辨率和信噪比条件下探测恒星CME的信号，并推断其速度。这一研究为未来恒星CME探测仪器的设计和观测策略的发展提供了重要参考。 <div>
Stellar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from host stars are an important factor that affects the habitability of exoplanets. Although their solar counterparts have been well observed for decades, it is still very difficult to find solid evidence of stellar CMEs. Using the spectral line profile asymmetry caused by the Doppler shift of erupting plasma, several stellar CME candidates have been identified from spectral lines formed at chromospheric or transition region temperatures of the stars. However, a successful detection of stellar CME signals based on the profile asymmetries of coronal lines is still lacking. It is unclear whether we can detect such signals. Here we construct an analytical model for CMEs on solar-type stars and derive an expression of stellar extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) line profiles during CME eruptions. For different instrumental parameters, exposure times, CME propagation directions, and stellar activity levels, we synthesized the corresponding line profiles of Fe ixλ171.07 and Fe xvλ284.16. Further investigations provide constraints on the instrumental requirements for successful detection and characterization of stellar CMEs. Our results show that it is possible to detect stellar CME signals and infer their velocities based on spectral profile asymmetries using an EUV spectrometer with a moderate spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Our work provides important references for the design of future EUV spectrometers for stellar CME detection and the development of observation strategies.

Galactic and extragalactic objects in the Universe are sources of high-energy neutrinos that may contribute to the astrophysical neutrino signal seen by IceCube. Recently, a study done using cascade-like events seen by IceCube reported neutrino emission from the Galactic plane with >4σ significance. In this work, we put a lower limit on the number of Galactic sources required to explain this emission. To achieve this, we use a simulation package created to simulate point sources in the Galaxy along with the neutrino and gamma-ray flux emissions originating from them. Along with using past IceCube discovery potential curves, we also account for Eddington bias effects due to Poisson fluctuations in the number of detected neutrino events. We present a toy Monte Carlo simulation to show that there must be at least eight sources, each with luminosity less than 1.6 × 1035 erg s−1, responsible for the Galactic neutrino emission. Our results constrain the number of individual point-like emission regions, which apply both to discrete astrophysical sources and to individual points of diffuse emission.

这篇文章研究了太阳耀斑和日冕物质抛射（CME）在传播过程中的非径向运动以及它们与太阳活动周期的关系。研究使用了来自数据中心的256个事件，并分析了它们在天空平面上纬度的比较。研究确认了CME在太阳源区向赤道方向的偏移，在太阳第25个太阳活动周期的上升阶段尤为明显。同时，研究还发现了CME的线速度与PE-CME纬度偏移之间的关系，主要在200和800km/s之间。另外，研究比较了第24个太阳活动周期的上升和衰退阶段的非径向偏移情况，发现在衰退阶段更多的事件偏向极地方向，这一变化归因于在衰退阶段存在大量低纬度的日冕空洞以及邻近活跃区的影响。
<br /><br />总结: <div>
During their propagation, coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and prominences sometimes display a nonradial motion. During the years after the solar minimum, the CME central position angle tended to be offset closer to the equator compared to that of the associated prominence eruptions (PE). No such effect was observed during solar maximum. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the latitudinal offsets of CMEs with respect to their source regions. We study 256 events from SC 24 and SC 25, listed in the Coordinate Data Analysis Workshop Data Center. We analyzed the CMES radial offset from the associated PEs by comparing their latitudes in the plane of the sky. This work is an extension of the previous work by Gopalswamy et al., but with an independent data set. We have confirmed the systematic equatorward offset of CME from the solar source region for the rising phase of Solar Cycle 25. Our analysis of the relation between CME linear speed and PE-CME latitudinal offset indicated that the velocities of the deflected CMEs are mainly in the range of 200 and 800 km s−1. In this study, we compared the nonradial offsets for the rising and decay phases of SC 24 and our analysis has shown that during the decay phase more events deflected toward the pole can be observed. The observed variation is attributed to the presence of a substantial number of low-latitude coronal holes during the decay phase and to the influence from nearby active regions.

The astrophysical origin of stellar-mass black hole (BH) mergers discovered through gravitational waves (GWs) is widely debated. Mergers in the disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) represent promising environments for at least a fraction of these events, with possible observational clues in the GW data. An additional clue to unveil AGN merger environments is provided by possible electromagnetic emission from postmerger accreting BHs. Associated with BH mergers in AGN disks, emission from shocks emerging around jets launched by accreting merger remnants is expected. Here we compute the properties of the emission produced during breakout and the subsequent adiabatic expansion phase of the shocks, and we then apply this model to optical flares suggested to be possibly associated with GW events. We find that the majority of the reported flares can be explained by breakout and shock cooling emission. If the optical flares are produced by shock cooling emission, they would display moderate color evolution, possibly color variations among different events, and a positive correlation between delay time and flare duration and would be preceded by breakout emission in X-rays. If the breakout emission dominates the observed lightcurve, we predict the color to be distributed in a narrow range in the optical band and the delay time from GW to electromagnetic emission to be longer than ∼2 days. Hence, further explorations of delay time distributions, flare color evolution, and associated X-ray emission will be useful to test the proposed emission model for the observed flares.

太阳表面的磁拓扑对太阳耀斑和日冕物质抛射的能量积累和释放起着关键作用。磁场的拓扑结构决定了电流片是否形成以及磁重连发生的位置。研究发现，具有嵌套双极点和两个零点的磁拓扑可以解释更复杂的动力学现象，如失败的喷发和日冕物质抛射与射流的相互作用。通过分析2013年7月13日在NOAA 11791活动区的事件，研究发现内部活跃区发生了喷发并伴随着耀斑，随后磁场发生重连。研究结果显示，内部零点和外部零点的重连差异自然地解释了观察到的弱射流和喷发的停滞现象。这些结果对于失败的太阳喷发有着一般性的启示。<br /><br /> <div>
The magnetic topology of erupting regions on the Sun is a key factor in the energy buildup and release, and the subsequent evolution of flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The presence/absence of null points and separatrices dictates whether and where current sheets form and magnetic reconnection occurs. Numerical simulations show that energy buildup and release via reconnection in the simplest configuration with a null, the embedded bipole, is a universal mechanism for solar eruptions. Here we demonstrate that a magnetic topology with nested bipoles and two nulls can account for more complex dynamics, such as failed eruptions and CME–jet interactions. We investigate the stalled eruption of a nested configuration on 2013 July 13 in NOAA Active Region 11791, in which a small bipole is embedded within a large transequatorial pseudo-streamer containing a null. In the studied event, the inner active region erupted, ejecting a small flux rope behind a shock accompanied by a flare; the flux rope then reconnected with pseudo-streamer flux and, rather than escaping intact, mainly distorted the pseudo-streamer null into a current sheet. EUV and coronagraph images revealed a weak shock and a faint collimated outflow from the pseudo-streamer. We analyzed Solar Dynamics Observatory and Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory observations and compared the inferred magnetic evolution and dynamics with three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulations of a simplified representation of this nested fan-spine system. The results suggest that the difference between breakout reconnection at the inner null and at the outer null naturally accounts for the observed weak jet and stalled ejection. We discuss the general implications of our results for failed eruptions.

We study stars in the J-regions of the asymptotic giant branch (JAGB) of near-infrared color–magnitude diagrams in the maser host NGC 4258 and four hosts of six Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia): NGC 1448, NGC 1559, NGC 5584, and NGC 5643. These clumps of stars are readily apparent near 1.0 < F150W − F277W < 1.5 and mF150W = 22–25 mag with James Webb Space Telescope NIRCam photometry. Various methods have been proposed to assign an apparent reference magnitude to this recently proposed standard candle, including the mode, median, sigma-clipped mean, or a modeled luminosity function parameter. We test the consistency of these by measuring intrahost variations, finding differences of up to ∼0.2 mag that significantly exceed statistical uncertainties. Brightness differences appear intrinsic, and are further amplified by the nonuniform shape of the JAGB luminosity function, also apparent in the LMC and SMC. We follow a “many methods” approach to measure consistently JAGB magnitudes and distance moduli to the SN Ia host sample calibrated by NGC 4258. We find broad agreement with distance moduli measured from Cepheids, tip of the red giant branch, and Miras. However, the SN host mean distance modulus estimated via the JAGB method necessary to estimate H0 differs by ∼0.19 mag among the above definitions, the result of different levels of luminosity function asymmetry. The methods yield a full range of 71−78 km s−1 Mpc−1, i.e., a fiducial result of H0 = 74.7 ± 2.1(stat) ± 2.3(sys, ±3.1 if combined in quadrature) km s−1 Mpc−1, with systematic errors limited by the differences in methods. Future work may seek to standardize and refine this promising tool further, making it more competitive with established distance indicators.

The Omh2(zi, zj) two-point diagnostics was proposed as a litmus test of the ΛCDM model, and measurements of the cosmic expansion rate H(z) have been extensively used to perform this test. The results obtained so far suggested a tension between observations and predictions of the ΛCDM model. However, the data set of H(z) direct measurements from cosmic chronometers and baryon acoustic oscillations was quite limited. This motivated us to study the performance of this test on a larger sample obtained in an alternative way. In this paper, we propose that gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens could provide large samples of H(z) measurements in the redshift range of 0 < z < 5, based on the measurements of the dipole anisotropy of luminosity distance arising from the matter inhomogeneities of the large-scale structure and the local motion of the observer. We discuss the effectiveness of our method in the context of the space-borne DECi-herz Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory, based on a comprehensive H(z) simulated data set from binary neutron star merger systems. Our results indicate that in the GW domain, the Omh2(zi, zj) two-point diagnostics could effectively distinguish whether ΛCDM is the best description of our Universe. We also discuss the potential of our methodology in determining possible evidence for dark energy evolution, focusing on its performance on the constant and redshift-dependent dark energy equation of state.

To study the role of environment in galaxy evolution, we reconstruct the underlying density field of galaxies based on COSMOS2020 (The Farmer catalog) and provide the density catalog for a magnitude-limited (Ks < 24.5) sample of ∼210,000 galaxies at 0.4 < z < 5 within the COSMOS field. The environmental densities are calculated using a weighted kernel density estimation approach with the choice of a von Mises–Fisher kernel, an analog of the Gaussian kernel for periodic data. Additionally, we make corrections for the edge effect and masked regions in the field. We utilize physical properties extracted by LePhare to investigate the connection between star formation activity and the environmental density of galaxies in six mass-complete subsamples at different cosmic epochs within 0.4 < z < 4. Our findings confirm a strong anticorrelation between star formation rate (SFR)/specific SFR (sSFR) and environmental density out to z ∼ 1.1. At 1.1 < z < 2, there is no significant correlation between SFR/sSFR and density. At 2 < z < 4, we observe a reversal of the SFR/sSFR–density relation such that both SFR and sSFR increase by a factor of ∼10 with increasing density contrast, δ, from −0.4 to 5. This observed reversal at higher redshifts supports the scenario where an increased availability of gas supply, along with tidal interactions and a generally higher star formation efficiency in dense environments, could potentially enhance star formation activity in galaxies located in rich environments at z > 2.

The duration of orbital decay induced by gravitational waves (GWs) is often the bottleneck of the evolutionary phases going from star formation to a merger. We show here that kicks imparted to the newly born compact object during the second collapse generically result in a GW merger time distribution behaving like at short durations, leading to ultrafast mergers. Namely, a nonnegligible fraction of neutron star binaries, formed in this way, will merge on a timescale as short as 10 Myr, and a small fraction will merge even on a timescale less than 10 kyr. The results can be applied to different types of compact binaries. We discuss here the implications for binary neutron star mergers. These include unique short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), eccentric and misaligned mergers, r-process enrichment in the very early Universe and in highly star-forming regions, and possible radio precursors. Interestingly, we conclude that among the few hundred short GRBs detected so far, a few must have formed via this ultrafast channel.

<title>Solar Energetic Particle and the Heliospheric Current Sheet</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad33c2</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The effect of the heliospheric current sheet (HCS) on the propagation of solar energetic particles (SEPs) remains poorly known. In this study we address this question by surveying energetic (∼2.0–9.6 MeV nucleon–1) helium data acquired by the energetic particle acceleration, composition, and transport (EPACT) sensor on board the Wind spacecraft. A superposed epoch analysis of 319 HCS crossings made by Wind reveals a sharp drop in the SEP fluxes at the HCS for the low-energy channels and little change across the HCS for the high-energy channels. To help understand the statistical result, we studied a total of 15 SEP flux dropout (a decrease of ∼50% or more) events that coincided with the crossing of the HCS. One of the common features of these SEP events is that they were initiated in the western hemisphere but far away from the longitude of HCS crossings, suggesting that the source of SEPs was well connected initially but was cut off later after Wind moved to the opposite hemisphere (e.g., HCS crossing). Further analysis of the events suggests that the percentage of flux dropouts decreases with increasing energy. It is suggested that a strong scattering of MeV helium may have occurred as the particle gyroradius is comparable to the thickness of the current sheet. This study clearly provides solid evidence for the HCS as a barrier to suppressing SEP flux of MeV energies from the onset hemisphere to the other.

<title>Circumnuclear Multiphase Gas in the Circinus Galaxy. VI. Detectability of Molecular Inflow and Atomic Outflow</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent submillimeter observations have revealed signs of parsec-scale molecular inflow and atomic outflow in the nearest Seyfert 2 galaxy, the Circinus galaxy. To verify the gas kinematics suggested by these observations, we performed molecular and atomic line transfer calculations based on a physics-based 3D radiation-hydrodynamic model, which has been compared with multiwavelength observations in this paper series. The major-axis position–velocity diagram (PVD) of CO(3–2) reproduces the observed faint emission at the systemic velocity, and our calculations confirm that this component originates from failed winds falling back to the disk plane. The minor-axis PVD of [C i](3P1–3P0), when created using only the gas with positive radial velocities, presents a sign of blueshifted and redshifted offset peaks similar to those in the observation, suggesting that the observed peaks indeed originate from the outflow, but that the model may lack outflows as strong as those in the Circinus galaxy. Similar to the observed HCN(3–2), the similar dense-gas tracer HCO+(3–2) can exhibit nuclear spectra with inverse P-Cygni profiles with ∼0.5 pc beams, but the line shape is azimuthally dependent. The corresponding continuum absorbers are inflowing clumps at 5–10 pc from the center. To detect significant absorption with a high probability, the inclination must be fairly edge-on (≳85°), and the beam size must be small (≲1 pc). These results suggest that HCN or HCO+ and [C i] lines are effective for observing parsec-scale inflows and outflows, respectively.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Hobby–Eberly Telescope (HET) VIRUS Parallel Survey (HETVIPS) is a blind spectroscopic program that sparsely covers approximately two-thirds of the celestial sphere and consists of roughly 252 million fiber spectra. The spectra were taken in parallel mode with the Visible Integral-field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS) instrument when the HET was observing a primary target with other HET facility instruments. VIRUS can simultaneously obtain approximately 35,000 spectra covering 3470–5540 Å at a spectral resolution of ≈800. Although the vast majority of these spectra cover blank sky, we used the Pan-STARRS1 Data Release 2 Stacked Catalog to identify objects encompassed in the HETVIPS pointings and extract their spectra. This paper presents the first HETVIPS data release, containing 493,012 flux-calibrated spectra obtained through 2023 March 31, as well as a description of the data processing technique. Each of the object spectra were classified, resulting in a catalog of 74,196 galaxies, 4,087 quasars, 259,396 stars, and 154,543 unknown sources.

<div> relativistic jets, gamma-ray burst, special relativistic effects, pulse asymmetry, ballistic jet model
<br />
这篇文章提出了伽马射线暴脉冲产生的假设，即高度相对论性的射流横扫观察者的视线时会产生。作者假设轴对称的喷流配置，结合特殊相对论效应，产生了GRB脉冲的时间反转特性。快速喷流膨胀导致的曲率是观测到的脉冲不对称和硬到软演变的主要原因。喷流相对于视线的相对倾斜度解释了已知的GRB脉冲形态类型。作者探讨了两种情景：一种是刚性/半刚性喷流的横向移动，另一种是弹道喷流从一个横向移动的喷口喷出物质。基于其与标准发射机制的一致性，更倾向于弹道喷流模型。 
<br /><br />总结：本文提出伽马射线暴脉冲产生的假设，探讨了相对论性喷流和特殊相对论效应，以及GRB脉冲的形态类型和动力学演变。作者提出了两种情景，并更倾向于弹道喷流模型。 <div>
We propose that gamma-ray burst (GRB) pulses are produced when highly relativistic jets sweep across an observer’s line of sight. We hypothesize that axisymmetric jet profiles, coupled with special relativistic effects, produce the time-reversed properties of GRB pulses. Curvature resulting from rapid jet expansion is responsible for much of the observed pulse asymmetry and hard-to-soft evolution. The relative obliqueness with which the jet crosses the line of sight explains the known GRB pulse morphological types. We explore two scenarios: one in which a rigid/semirigid jet moves laterally and another in which a ballistic jet sprays material from a laterally moving nozzle. The ballistic jet model is favored based upon its consistency with standard emission mechanisms.

<div> Spitzer, IRAC, SMUVS, UltraVISTA, JWST
总结:
该研究对COSMOS领域的26个Spitzer/IRAC选择的源进行了表征，这些源在UltraVISTA DR5 H-和/或Ks波段图像中未被检测到，覆盖了94平方弧分钟。研究分析了JWST的深度多波段光度学数据，并通过SED拟合揭示了这些星系的性质。研究发现，大多数星系在JWST/NIRCam波段λ<2μm处被检测到，只有四个在更深的JWST图像中仍然是近红外波段的辐射漏出。结果表明，UltraVISTA的候选漏出源主要位于z>3，并且具有高尘埃消光，典型的颜色过剩E(B − V) = 0.5 ± 0.3和恒星质量。值得注意的是，约75%的源显示出观测光度和模拟连续SED之间的流量增强，可以归因于相应NIRCam波段的Hα发射。推导得到的(Hα+N [ii]+S [ii])静息等效宽度和Hα星形成速率(SFR)的数值分别为∼100-2200 Å和∼5-375 M⊙ yr−1。这些源在SFR-M*平面上的位置表明其中35%为星暴星系，40%为主序星系，其余25%位于星形成谷。样本中包括一个活跃星系核和六个亚毫米源，这是通过辅助X射线和亚毫米波段光度学数据揭示的。高尘埃消光结合Hα发射的流量增强解释了为什么这些源在Spitzer成像中相对较亮，却在ultradeep UltraVISTA近红外图像中无法识别。 <div>
We have characterized 26 Spitzer/IRAC-selected sources from the SMUVS program that are undetected in the UltraVISTA DR5 H- and/or Ks-band images, covering 94 arcmin2 of the COSMOS field, which have deep multiwavelength JWST photometry. We analyzed the JWST/NIRCam imaging from the PRIMER survey and ancillary HST data to reveal the properties of these galaxies from spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. We find that the majority of these galaxies are detected by NIRCam at λ < 2 μm, with only four remaining as near-infrared dropouts in the deeper JWST images. Our results indicate that the UltraVISTA dropouts candidates are primarily located at z > 3 and are characterized by high dust extinctions, with a typical color excess E(B − V) = 0.5 ± 0.3 and stellar mass . Remarkably, ∼75% of these sources show a flux enhancement between the observed photometry and modeled continuum SED that can be attributed to Hα emission in the corresponding NIRCam bands. The derived (Hα+ N [ii] + S [ii]) rest-frame equivalent widths and Hα star formation rates (SFRs) span values ∼100–2200 Å and ∼5–375 M⊙ yr−1, respectively. The locations of these sources on the SFR–M* plane indicate that 35% of them are starbursts, 40% are main-sequence galaxies, and the remaining 25% are located in the star formation valley. Our sample includes one active galactic nucleus and six submillimeter sources, as revealed from ancillary X-ray and submillimeter photometry. The high dust extinctions combined with the flux boosting from Hα emission explain why these sources are relatively bright Spitzer galaxies and yet unidentified in the ultradeep UltraVISTA near-infrared images.

总结:<br /><br />本研究探讨了银河系中超金属贫的恒星大气中锶至银（Z = 38–47）的元素丰度，该丰度可能包含了早期核心坍缩超新星爆发中弱r过程和νp过程的特征。通过结合基于稳态模型的各种天体物理条件，涵盖了超新星喷发的丰富熵、膨胀时间尺度和电子丰度。根据不同条件的计算丰度与恒星观测进行比较，以限制超新星喷发的条件。研究发现，一些中微子驱动的喷发条件可以一致地重现我们样本的观测丰度。此外，通过成功的组合发现，富中子的轨迹更好地重现了银河（Z = 38–40）的观测丰度，而贫质子的轨迹更好地重现了（Z = 42–47）的观测丰度。 <div>
The elemental abundances between strontium and silver (Z = 38–47) observed in the atmospheres of very metal-poor stars in the Galaxy may contain the fingerprint of the weak r-process and νp-process occurring in early core-collapse supernovae explosions. In this work, we combine various astrophysical conditions based on a steady-state model to cover the richness of the supernova ejecta in terms of entropy, expansion timescale, and electron fraction. The calculated abundances based on different combinations of conditions are compared with stellar observations, with the aim of constraining supernova ejecta conditions. We find that some conditions of the neutrino-driven outflows consistently reproduce the observed abundances of our sample. In addition, from the successful combinations, the neutron-rich trajectories better reproduce the observed abundances of Sr–Zr (Z = 38–40), while the proton-rich ones, Mo–Pd (Z = 42–47).

<div> 钙铝富集包裹体（CAIs），太阳系，氧同位素，铝同位素，岩石圈<br />
总结：<br />
CAIs是太阳系形成时期最古老的固体物质，它们在不经变质的球粒陨石中具有与太阳类似的氧同位素组成和较高的初始26Al/27Al比值。球粒陨石中CAIs的氧同位素异质性可能记录了CAI形成区域的气体氧同位素组成波动，以及岩石母天体中CAI矿物与水溶液发生的氧同位素交换。达尔·阿尔·加尼083的CO3.1球粒陨石中的一个CAI包裹体显示了氧同位素的不均匀性，并且经过研究发现，CAI中的铝镁同位素系统没有受到干扰。这表明CAI形成区域的气体氧同位素组成在注入和/或混合26Al之前发生了波动。同时，CAI的初生矿物未受到影响，但grossite和melilite的氧同位素出现了16O耗尽的现象，这可能是与小行星内部的流体发生了氧同位素交换。 <div>
Calcium, aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) are the oldest solids dated that formed in the solar system. Most CAIs in unmetamorphosed chondritic meteorites (chondrites; petrologic type ≤3.0) have uniform solar-like 16O-rich compositions (Δ17O ∼ −24‰) and a high initial 26Al/27Al ratio [(26Al/27Al)0] of ∼(4–5) × 10−5, consistent with their origin in a gas of approximately solar composition during a brief (<0.3 Ma) epoch at the earliest stage of our solar system. The nature of O-isotope heterogeneity in CAIs (Δ17O range from ∼−24 up to ∼+5‰) from weakly metamorphosed chondrites (petrologic type >3.0) remains an open issue. This heterogeneity could have recorded fluctuations of O-isotope composition of nebular gas in the CAI-forming region and/or postcrystallization O-isotope exchange of CAI minerals with aqueous fluids on the chondrite parent asteroids. To obtain insights into possible processes resulting in this heterogeneity, we investigated the mineralogy, rare-earth element abundances, and O- and Mg-isotope compositions of a CAI from the CO3.1 chondrite Dar al Gani 083. This concentrically zoned inclusion has a Zn-hercynite core surrounded by layers of (from core to edge) grossite, spinel, melilite, and Al-diopside. The various phases have heterogeneous Δ17O (from core to edge): −2.2 ± 0.6‰, −0.9 ± 2.1‰, −13.7 ± 2.1‰, −2.6 ± 2.3‰, and −22.6 ± 2.1‰, respectively. Magnesium-isotope compositions of grossite, spinel, melilite, and Al-diopside define an undisturbed internal Al–Mg isochron with (26Al/27Al)0 of (2.60 ± 0.29) × 10−6. We conclude that the variations in Δ17O of spinel and diopside recorded fluctuations in O-isotope composition of nebular gas in the CAI-forming region prior to injection and/or homogenization of 26Al at the canonical level. The 16O depletion of grossite and melilite resulted from O-isotope exchange with asteroidal fluid, which did not disturb Al–Mg isotope systematics of the CAI primary minerals.

<div> Wolf–Rayet binary, Massive binary black holes, Chemically homogeneous evolution, MESA, Bayesian approach <br />
总结: 通过使用MESA模拟密集的大质量双星系统，并采用贝叶斯方法与观测数据进行比较，研究了HD 5980 A&amp;B的形成。发现初始周期约为3天，随着质量损失而扩大到现今的约20天轨道，星体初始质量很高，推测可能由于增加的质量流失而形成。进一步模拟了星体的进化，发现它们可能演化为质量约为19-37太阳质量的黑洞，虽然无法通过引力波融合，但通过可能的第三和第四伴星的影响，系统可能迅速成为引力波源。 <div>
Chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) is a promising channel for forming massive binary black holes. The enigmatic, massive Wolf–Rayet binary HD 5980 A&amp;B has been proposed to have formed through this channel. We investigate this claim by comparing its observed parameters with CHE models. Using MESA, we simulate grids of close massive binaries, then use a Bayesian approach to compare them with the stars’ observed orbital period, masses, luminosities, and hydrogen surface abundances. The most probable models, given the observational data, have initial periods ∼3 days, widening to the present-day ∼20 days orbit as a result of mass loss—correspondingly, they have very high initial stellar masses (≳150 M⊙). We explore variations in stellar-wind mass loss and internal mixing efficiency, and find that models assuming enhanced mass loss are greatly favored to explain HD 5980, while enhanced mixing is only slightly favored over our fiducial assumptions. Our most probable models slightly underpredict the hydrogen surface abundances. Regardless of its prior history, this system is a likely binary black hole progenitor. We model its further evolution under our fiducial and enhanced wind assumptions, finding that both stars produce black holes with masses ∼19–37 M⊙. The projected final orbit is too wide to merge within a Hubble time through gravitational waves alone. However, the system is thought to be part of a 2+2 hierarchical multiple. We speculate that secular effects with the (possible) third and fourth companions may drive the system to promptly become a gravitational-wave source.

<div> 关键词: 活动星系核，光变曲线，DRW模型，CHAR模型，阻尼时间尺度

活动星系核（AGN）的UV/光学光变曲线通常用Damped Random Walk（DRW）模型来描述。然而，阻尼时间尺度，一个关键参数的物理解释仍不清楚。最近的观察表明，阻尼时间尺度对波长和吸积速率的依赖性较弱，与吸积盘理论明显不一致。在这项研究中，我们在Corona Heated Accretion disk Reprocessing（CHAR）模型的框架内研究了阻尼时间尺度，该模型描述了AGN的变化。我们发现CHAR模型可以重现Stone等人的190个源20年光变曲线的观测功率谱密度，还可以通过拟合模拟光变曲线来很好地恢复观测阻尼时间尺度及其对波长的微弱依赖性。我们进一步证明了这种微弱依赖性是由于光变曲线持续时间不足所造成的，这导致最佳拟合的阻尼时间尺度低于固有阻尼时间尺度。在排除了这种影响后，CHAR模型确实显示了阻尼时间尺度对辐射顶点亮度和固有波长的强烈依赖性。我们的结果凸显了AGN变化研究中对充分长的光变曲线需求，以及CHAR模型在这类研究中的重要应用。
<br /><br />总结: 本文研究了活动星系核光变曲线的特征，发现DRW模型对阻尼时间尺度的描述存在问题，提出了CHAR模型来描述AGN的变化过程。通过模拟光变曲线的拟合发现了DRW模型的局限性，并证明了CHAR模型对阻尼时间尺度的正确描述，强调了AGN变化研究中的重要性。 <div>
The UV/optical light curves of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are commonly described by the Damped Random Walk (DRW) model. However, the physical interpretation of the damping timescale, a key parameter in the DRW model, remains unclear. Particularly, recent observations indicate a weak dependence of the damping timescale upon both wavelength and accretion rate, clearly being inconsistent with the accretion-disk theory. In this study, we investigate the damping timescale in the framework of the Corona Heated Accretion disk Reprocessing (CHAR) model, a physical model that describes AGN variability. We find that while the CHAR model can reproduce the observed power spectral densities of the 20 yr light curves for 190 sources from Stone et al., the observed damping timescale, as well as its weak dependence on wavelength, can also be well recovered through fitting the mock light curves with DRW. We further demonstrate that such weak dependence is artificial due to the effect of inadequate durations of light curves, which leads to best-fitting damping timescales lower than the intrinsic ones. After eliminating this effect, the CHAR model indeed yields a strong dependence of the intrinsic damping timescale on the bolometric luminosity and rest-frame wavelength. Our results highlight the demand for sufficiently long light curves in AGN variability studies and important applications of the CHAR model in such studies.

The drag force experienced by astronomical objects moving through gaseous media (gas dynamical friction) plays a crucial role in their orbital evolution. Ostriker derived a formula for gas dynamical friction by linear analysis, and its validity has been confirmed through subsequent numerical simulations. However, the effect of gas accretion onto the objects on the dynamical friction is yet to be understood. In this study, we investigate the Mach number dependence of dynamical friction considering gas accretion through three-dimensional nested-grid simulations. We find that the net frictional force, determined by the sum of the gravitational force exerted by surrounding gas and momentum flux transferred by accreting gas, is independent of the resolution of simulations. Only the gas outside the Bondi–Hoyle–Lyttleton radius contributes to dynamical friction, because the gas inside this radius is eventually absorbed by the central object and returns the momentum obtained through the gravitational interaction with it. In the subsonic case, the front–back asymmetry induced by gas accretion leads to larger dynamical friction than predicted by the linear theory. Conversely, in the slightly supersonic case with a Mach number between 1 and 1.5, the nonlinear effect leads to a modification of the density distribution in a way that reduces the dynamical friction, compared with the linear theory. At a higher Mach number, the modification becomes insignificant and the dynamical friction can be estimated with the linear theory. We also provide a fitting formula for dynamical friction based on our simulations, which can be used in a variety of applications.

总结:
太阳上观察到了一个静态的色球丝状物质，在附近活跃区域发生了B9.7级耀斑后，开始出现运动。在此过程中，观察到了黑色和亮色的丝状物质开始出现旋转运动，最终整个丝状物质不仅升起，而且在爆发期间出现了双螺旋结构。通过磁场建模发现，磁重联导致了丝状物质的不稳定并爆发。这项研究显示出磁扭结在日冕物质爆发中的重要作用。 <div>
We investigate a quiescent filament that erupted on 2013 August 2; the eruption was observed in EUV and Hα by the Solar Dynamics Observatory and GONG. After a B9.7 flare in the nearby active region, the dark filament materials near its eastern footpoint start to move in the direction of eruption, and are followed by a counterclockwise rotation identified as the motion of a combination of dark and bright filament materials. Then the entire filament rises up and keeps rotating in a clockwise direction during the eruption. More interestingly, the filament exhibits an unusual two-helix structure near its western footpoint during the eruption, which indicates the existence of a highly twisted flux rope. This hypothesis is confirmed by magnetic field modeling using the flux rope insertion method. In the best-fit unstable model, the lower limits of the estimated maximum and average twist numbers of the erupting flux rope reach 7.5π and 4π, which suggests that kink instability plays an important role in the eruption. During these magnetically coupled sympathetic eruptions, the highly twisted filament under the western lobe of a pseudo-streamer-like structure becomes unstable and erupts due to the removal of confinement by magnetic reconnection at the overlying hyperbolic flux tube, which is initiated by the B9.7 flare in the nearby active region. The initial filament motion occurs at the more unstable eastern footpoint, where the surrounding fields are weaker and decrease with height more rapidly.

在这项研究中，我们扩大了样本到 Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) 数据库，选择了123个具有足够变化性和平滑光变曲线的1型活动星系核(AGNs)，对来自ZTF数据库的3537个z < 0.09的AGNs进行了观测。从中我们计算了23个具有先前光谱时滞映射(SRM)结果的Hα时滞，使用了ICCF-Cut，JAVELIN和χ^2等方法。我们得到的Hα时滞略大于Hβ时滞，这与先前的SRM结果和AGN宽线区域的理论模型一致。通过对比SRM和PRM时滞分布和减去的发射线光变曲线，我们发现，在选择具有两个标准的AGNs之后，结合ICCF-Cut，JAVELIN和χ^2方法提供了一种有效的方式来从宽带PRM中获得可靠的Hα时滞。这些技术可以被用来在未来的大型多时相光度天文勘测中估算大量AGNs的黑洞质量，比如空间遗产调查和近期即将进行的广域巡天望远镜调查。 <br /><br />总结: <br />扩大样本至ZTF数据库，筛选出123个AGNs进行研究；使用ICCF-Cut，JAVELIN和χ^2方法得到Hα时滞结果，与先前的SRM结果和AGN宽线区域的理论一致；这些技术对于估算大量AGNs的黑洞质量非常有效。 <div>
In our previous work on broadband photometric reverberation mapping (PRM), we proposed the interpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF)-Cut process to obtain the time lags of the Hα emission line from two broadband lightcurves via subtracting the continuum emission from the line band. Extending the work, we enlarge our sample to the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) database. We adopt two criteria to select 123 type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with sufficient variability and smooth light curves from 3537 AGNs at z < 0.09 with more than 100 epoch observations in the g and r bands from the ZTF database. We calculate the Hα time lags for 23 of them that have previous spectroscopic reverberation mapping (SRM) results using the ICCF-Cut, Just Another Vehicle for Estimating Lags In Nuclei (JAVELIN), and χ2 methods. Our obtained Hα time lags are slightly larger than the Hβ time lags, which is consistent with the previous SRM results and the theoretical model of the AGN broad-line region. The comparisons between the SRM and PRM lag distributions and between the subtracted emission line light curves indicate that after selecting AGNs with the two criteria, combining the ICCF-Cut, JAVELIN, and χ2 methods provides an efficient way to get the reliable Hα lags from the broadband PRM. Such techniques can be used to estimate the black hole masses of a large sample of AGNs in large multiepoch photometric sky surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time and the survey from the Wide Field Survey Telescope in the near future.

Brown dwarfs (BDs) in ultra-short-period orbits around white dwarfs (WDs) offer a unique opportunity to study the properties of tidally locked, fast-rotating (1–3 hr), and highly irradiated atmospheres. Here we present phase-resolved spectrophotometry of the WD–BD binary SDSS 1557, which is the fifth WD–BD binary in our six-object sample. Using the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 Near-infrared G141 instrument, the 1.1–1.7 μm phase curves show rotational modulations with semiamplitudes of 10.5% ± 0.1%. We observe a wavelength-dependent amplitude, with longer wavelengths producing larger amplitudes, while no wavelength-dependent phase shifts were identified. The phase-resolved extracted BD spectra exhibit steep slopes and are nearly featureless. A simple radiative energy redistribution atmospheric model re-creates the hemisphere-integrated brightness temperatures at three distinct phases and finds evidence for weak redistribution efficiency. Our model also predicts a higher inclination than previously published. We find that SDSS 1557B, the second most irradiated BD in our sample, is likely dominated by clouds on the nightside, whereas the featureless dayside spectrum is likely dominated by H− opacity and a temperature inversion, much like the other highly irradiated BD EPIC 2122B.

本文讨论了关于密集恒星物质的等压物态方程的不确定性，指出夸克物质可能是真实的零压地面状态。文章还讨论了夸克之间的吸引力作用和它们易于形成库珀对的性质，提出了夸克物质可能具有超导性，尤其是在中等高密度下会呈现两味夸克配对的特性。最近报道了几种自结合的夸克星候选者，包括超新星残骸HESS J1731-347中的超低质量中心紧凑天体。文章利用Nambu-Jona-Lasinio模型对两味夸克色超导（2SC）相的稳定性进行了研究，但并未找到存在2SC夸克星的物理允许参数空间。 <div>
Large uncertainties in the determinations of the equation of state of dense stellar matter allow for the intriguing possibility that the bulk quark matter in beta equilibrium might be the true ground state of the matter at zero pressure. Also, quarks will form Cooper pairs very readily since the dominant interaction between quarks is attractive in some channels. As a result, quark matter will generically exhibit color superconductivity, with the favored pairing pattern at intermediately high densities being two-flavor pairing. In the light of several possible candidates for such self-bound quark stars, including the very low-mass central compact object in supernova remnant HESS J1731-347 reported recently, we carry out a one-field theoretic model, the Nambu–Jona–Lasinio model, to investigate the stability of the beta-stable two-flavor color superconducting (2SC) phase of quark matter, but find no physically allowed parameter space for the existence of 2SC quark stars.

<title>The Opposite Behaviors of Proton and Electron Temperatures in Relation to Solar Wind Magnetic Energy: Parker Solar Probe Observations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Solar wind heating is an outstanding issue that has been discussed for decades. Research on the connection between solar wind particle temperatures and turbulence may provide insight into this issue. Based on Parker Solar Probe observations, this paper investigates the properties of solar wind proton and electron temperatures in relation to turbulent magnetic energy, via the calculation of correlation coefficients (CCs) between particle temperatures and magnetic energy. The calculations are regulated by the spatial scale, plasma beta (β), and the angle between the solar wind velocity and background magnetic field, where the plasma beta is the ratio of plasma thermal to magnetic pressure. Results show that the correlation between proton temperature and magnetic energy is positive and can be strong with a CC exceeding 0.8. The strong correlation preferentially occurs at ion scales, with the wind velocity and background magnetic field quasi-perpendicular and over a wide beta range (β < 3.0). On the other hand, the correlation between electron temperature and magnetic energy is commonly negative, often with an intermediate or negligible CC, accordingly. The CC with an amplitude up to 0.8 can arise at larger scales with the wind velocity and background magnetic field quasi-(anti)parallel and in the low-beta case (β < 0.6). The implication of these findings on the physics of turbulent heating in the solar wind is discussed.

<title>Ion Heating by a Fast Magnetosonic Turbulence in the Solar Corona</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3727</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Observational data at heliocentric distances of tens of solar radii suggest that fast magnetosonic modes make up a considerable fraction of the solar wind fluctuations. Furthermore, this fraction appears to increase closer to the Sun. We carry out three-dimensional kinetic simulations with particle ions and fluid electrons to evaluate the proton and alpha-particle heating produced by the damping of the fast waves in the solar corona. Realistic parameters at 5 solar radii, including the fluctuation amplitude, are used. We show that, due to the cyclotron resonance, the alphas are heated preferentially perpendicularly to the magnetic field and much more strongly than the protons. The presence of the alpha particles alters the energy partition by reducing the heating of the protons. Nevertheless, the proton heating is sufficient to account for the solar wind acceleration.

JWST观测证明在低质量M矮星的球状星团(GCs)中，检测到多个恒星群是有效的。研究展示了使用JWST观测计划GO2560在47 Tucanae进行的观测所获得的第一批结果，这是首个完全致力于探索极低质量恒星多群现象的研究项目。通过彩色-等级图(CMD)发现超冷恒星存在亚结构，包括间隙和斜率变化。特别是，在F322W2亮度函数中观察到一道间隙和一个最小值，两者相差不到1等，讨论它可能与氢燃烧限制有关。我们检测到比这个最小值更暗的恒星，很可能是棕矮星。我们证实了多个群在不同质量恒星中的普遍性，从约0.1 M⊙到红巨星 (∼0.8 M⊙)。从CMD和两个与不同群相关的M矮星的光谱中推断的氧范围与巨星观察到的类似。我们没有发现不同群中的恒星在大约0.1 M⊙以上的质量范围内的比例有任何差异。这项工作证明了JWST在揭示M矮星中的多个群的能力，并展示了分析接近氢燃烧极限和棕矮星序列的球状星团中极低质量恒星的可能性。 <br /><br />总结: JWST观测揭示了在球状星团中多种恒星群的存在，特别是对极低质量M矮星进行了深入研究，发现了多个亚群，并且证实了这种现象在不同质量范围内的恒星中的普遍性。氧的范围与巨星相似，同时也观察到了氢燃烧限制之下的恒星和可能的棕矮星。 <div>
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have been demonstrated to be efficient in detecting multiple stellar populations in globular clusters (GCs) in the low-mass regime of M dwarfs. We present an overview, and first results, of different projects that can be explored by using the JWST observations gathered under program GO2560 for 47 Tucanae, the first program entirely devoted to the investigation of multiple populations in very-low-mass stars, which includes spectroscopic data for the faintest GC stars for which spectra are available. Our color–magnitude diagram (CMD) shows some substructures for ultracool stars, including gaps and breaks in slope. In particular, we observe both a gap and a minimum in the F322W2 luminosity function less than 1 mag apart, and discuss which it could be associated with the H-burning limit. We detect stars fainter than this minimum, very likely brown dwarfs. We corroborate the ubiquity of the multiple populations across different masses, from ∼0.1 M⊙ up to red giants (∼0.8 M⊙). The oxygen range inferred for the M dwarfs, both from the CMD and from the spectra of two M dwarfs associated with different populations, is similar to that observed for giants. We have not detected any difference between the fractions of stars in distinct populations across stellar masses ≳ 0.1 M⊙. This work demonstrates the JWST's capability in uncovering multiple populations within M dwarfs and illustrates the possibility to analyze very-low-mass stars in GCs approaching the H-burning limit and the brown-dwarf sequence.

总结:<br />
使用Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy上的upGREAT仪器，从Nessie星云中的一个明亮光解区域（PDR）拍摄了[C ii] 157.74微米和[O i] 63.18微米的线发射。与澳大利亚紧凑射电阵列数据的比较显示经典的PDR结构，从离子化气体到光解气体，再到分子气体的进展。气泡的PDR的[O i]线发射显示自吸收特征。在远红外明亮原恒星附近，[O i]和[C ii]都显示出在−18 km s−1的吸收特征，与无关的前景分子云速度相同。Meudon模型表明，被标准G0 = 1的星际辐射场外部照射的分子云表面可能产生这些过渡的吸收特征。位于Nessie丝状红外暗云被气泡冲击的明亮年轻恒星物体AGAL337.916-00.477与两个冲击示踪物质相关联，表明气泡与丝状物质相互作用引发了星的形成。 <div>
Using the upGREAT instrument on board the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, we imaged [C ii] 157.74 and [O i] 63.18 μm line emission from a bright photodissociation region (PDR) associated with an ionized bubble located in the Nessie Nebula, a filamentary infrared dark cloud. A comparison with Australia Telescope Compact Array data reveals a classic photodissociation region (PDR) structure, with a uniform progression from ionized gas, to photodissociated gas, and to molecular gas from the bubble’s interior to its exterior. [O i] line emission from the bubble’s PDR reveals self-absorption features. Toward a far-IR bright protostar, both [O i] and [C ii] show an absorption feature at a velocity of −18 km s−1, the same velocity as an unrelated foreground molecular cloud. Since the gas density in typical molecular clouds is well below the [O i] and [C ii] critical densities, the excitation temperatures for both lines are low (∼20 K). The Meudon models demonstrate that the surface of a molecular cloud, externally illuminated by a standard G0 = 1 interstellar radiation field, can produce absorption features in both transitions. Thus, the commonly observed [O i] and [C ii] self-absorption and absorption features plausibly arise from the subthermally excited, externally illuminated photodissociated envelopes of molecular clouds. The luminous young stellar object AGAL337.916-00.477, located precisely where the expanding bubble strikes the Nessie filament, is associated with two shock tracers: NH3 (3,3) maser emission and SiO 2−1 emission, indicating an interaction between the bubble and the filament. The interaction of the expanding bubble with its parental dense filament has triggered star formation.

Magnetic fields are ubiquitous in the Universe and are thought to play an important role in various astrophysical processes. Polarization of thermal emission from dust grains aligned with the magnetic field is widely used to measure the 2D magnetic field projected onto the plane of the sky, but its component along the line of sight is not yet constrained. Here, we introduce a new method to infer 3D magnetic fields using thermal dust polarization and grain alignment physics. We first develop a physical model of thermal dust polarization using the modern grain alignment theory based on the magnetically enhanced radiative torque alignment theory. We then test this model with synthetic observations of magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a filamentary cloud with our updated POLARIS code. Combining the tested physical polarization model with synthetic polarization, we show that the B-field inclination angles can be accurately constrained by the polarization degree from synthetic observations. Compared to the true 3D magnetic fields, our method based on grain alignment physics is more accurate than the previous methods that assume uniform grain alignment. This new technique paves the way for tracing 3D B-fields using thermal dust polarization and grain alignment theory and for constraining dust properties and grain alignment physics.

总结: <br />
磁通量的涌现对太阳磁现象至关重要。使用深度学习技术改善了信噪比，使得我们可以逐案例进行研究。我们发现涌现引起的流动在不同情况下有所不同，且在宁静的对流背景中频繁发生。我们的分析表明，超粒子尺度的对流流动和磁浮力对磁通量的上升影响减弱。与数值证据一致，我们推测小尺度的表面湍流和/或深层对流过程在推动磁通量涌现方面发挥了巨大作用。 <div>
Magnetic flux emergence from the convection zone into the photosphere and beyond is a critical component of the behavior of large-scale solar magnetism. Flux rarely emerges amid field-free areas at the surface, but when it does, the interaction between the magnetism and plasma flows can be reliably explored. Prior ensemble studies have identified weak flows forming near emergence locations, but the low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) required averaging over the entire data set, erasing information about variation across the sample. Here, we apply deep learning to achieve an improved S/N, enabling a case-by-case study. We find that these associated flows are dissimilar across instances of emergence and also occur frequently in the quiet convective background. Our analysis suggests the diminished influence of supergranular-scale convective flows and magnetic buoyancy on flux rise. Consistent with numerical evidence, we speculate that small-scale surface turbulence and/or deep convective processes play an outsized role in driving flux emergence.

The relationship between CME properties in the corona and their interplanetary counterparts is not well understood. Until recently, a wide spatial gap existed between the two regions, which prevented us from disentangling the spatial and temporal evolution of CMEs. NASA’s Parker Solar Probe (PSP) has imaged multiple CMEs since its launch in 2018, but these events either intercepted the spacecraft far from the corona or completely missed it. Here we describe one of the first CMEs observed simultaneously by remote sensing and in situ instruments, and compare the corresponding measured properties, such as orientation, cross section diameter, density, and speed. The CME encounter occurred on 2022 June 2, while PSP was around 14 solar radii from the Sun center. We reconstruct the CME with forward modeling and determine its morphology and kinematics. The reconstruction suggests that PSP misses the CME apex but encounters its flank. The encounter time matches the period when the PSP in situ measurements indicate the passage of a CME. We also reconstruct the flux rope diameter and orientation using the in situ magnetic field measurements. The results are consistent with the CME reconstruction from imaging data. The close agreement between remote sensing and in situ analyses suggests that discrepancies found in past studies are more likely associated with the CME temporal evolution. We also find that the magnetic field of the CME flank extrapolated to 1 au is well below the average solar wind background and likely indistinguishable from it. This point could explain past events where the CMEs' interplanetary counterparts were not identified.

这篇文章介绍了第二次NuSTAR和XMM-Newton对JWST北黄道极（NEP）时间域场（TDF）的观测。该调查对硬X射线数量进行了考量，并发现了一些高度遮蔽的源。此外，XMM-Newton观测提供了软X射线覆盖，并对NuSTAR检测到的源的可靠对应进行了更强有力的确认。总之，这项研究为我们对太空中的天体有了更全面的认识。<br /><br />总结: <br />这项研究利用NuSTAR和XMM-Newton对NEP-TDF进行了第二次观测。通过这次观测，我们获得了迄今为止对NuSTAR外星系调查最敏感的结果，并探测到了60个源。结果显示，约47%的NuSTAR检测到的源具有严重遮挡，而%的源是钔厚的。同时，XMM-Newton观测对可见和红外对应进行了更可靠的鉴定。 <div>
We present the second NuSTAR and XMM-Newton extragalactic survey of the JWST north ecliptic pole (NEP) time-domain field (TDF). The first NuSTAR NEP-TDF survey had 681 ks total exposure time executed in NuSTAR cycle 5 in 2019 and 2020. This second survey, acquired from 2020 to 2022 in cycle 6, adds 880 ks of NuSTAR exposure time. The overall NuSTAR NEP-TDF survey is the most sensitive NuSTAR extragalactic survey to date, and a total of 60 sources were detected above the 95% reliability threshold. We constrain the hard X-ray number counts, – , down to 1.7 × 10−14 erg cm−2 s−1 at 8–24 keV and detect an excess of hard X-ray sources at the faint end. About 47% of the NuSTAR-detected sources are heavily obscured (NH > 1023 cm−2), and % of the NuSTAR-detected sources are Compton-thick (NH > 1024 cm−2). These fractions are consistent with those measured in other NuSTAR surveys. Four sources presented >2σ variability in the 3 yr survey. In addition to NuSTAR, a total of 62 ks of XMM-Newton observations were taken during NuSTAR cycle 6. The XMM-Newton observations provide soft X-ray (0.5–10 keV) coverage in the same field and enable more robust identification of the visible and infrared counterparts of the NuSTAR-detected sources. A total of 286 soft X-ray sources were detected, out of which 214 XMM-Newton sources have secure counterparts from multiwavelength catalogs.

<div> Brown dwarf binaries, photometric monitoring, variability, period range, atmosphere simulation
<br /><br />
Luhman 16 AB是一个强烈变化的棕矮双星系统，通过长达1200小时的光度监测，发现其存在数小时至数百小时的±5%变化。研究表明，5小时（k=1波数）和2.5小时（k=2波数）的短周期旋转调制主导了10小时内的变化，而由k=1和k=2波组成的行星尺度波模型能够很好地拟合周期图和光变曲线。此外，通过简单的太阳系巨行星带状模型，提出了潮纹区带风速分布不同导致k=1和k=2波周期范围差异的假设。最后，发现Luhman 16 AB还表现出长周期±5%的变化，周期范围从15小时到100小时不等。这些结果与之前的3D大气模拟一致，表明纬度相关波和缓慢变化的大气特征可能存在于Luhman 16 AB大气中，并且对数百个自转周期的光变有重要贡献。 <div>
In this work, we present the longest photometric monitoring of up to 1200 hr of the strongly variable brown dwarf binaries Luhman 16 AB and provide evidence of ±5% variability on a timescale of several to hundreds of hours for this object. We show that short-period rotational modulation around 5 hr (k = 1 wavenumber) and 2.5 hr (k = 2 wavenumber) dominate the variability under 10 hr, where the planetary-scale wave model composed of k = 1 and k = 2 waves provides good fits to both the periodograms and light curve. In particular, models consisting of three to four sine waves could explain the variability of the light-curve durations up to 100 hr. We show that the relative range of the k = 2 periods is narrower compared to the k = 1 periods. Using simple models of zonal banding in solar system giants, we suggest that the difference in period range arises from the difference in wind-speed distribution at low and mid-to-high latitudes in the atmosphere. Last, we show that Luhman 16 AB also exhibits long-period ±5% variability, with periods ranging from 15 hr up to 100 hr over the longest monitoring of this object. Our results for the k = 1 and k = 2 waves and long-period evolution are consistent with previous 3D atmosphere simulations, demonstrating that both latitude-dependent waves and slow-varying atmospheric features are potentially present in Luhman 16 AB atmospheres and are a significant contribution to the light-curve modulation over hundreds of rotations.

总结: 本文通过对所有可用的2分钟Tess数据进行目测检查，共识别出185颗极小的恒星中的5颗出现了6次耀斑事件。所有耀斑的辐射能量均超过10^34爱尔格，其中值介于10^35爱尔格左右，因此属于超级耀斑。其中有两次耀斑之后出现了亮度增强，可能表明白矮星发生了由日冕物质抛射引起的吸积突发事件。对探测结果的完整性分析表明，极小恒星的耀斑活动与M型矮星非常相似，这表明白矮星的高磁场对极小恒星的磁活动影响不大。我们估计还有大约20-30颗极小恒星存在磁活跃的辅星，因此鼓励进一步开展对极小恒星耀斑的更深入搜索。 <br /><br /> <div>
Flare events are magnetic activities on the stellar surface, which can provide us with information about the accretion behavior and evolution of polars. In this paper, we search for flare events on polars from all the available 2 minute cadence TESS data through visual inspection, and identify six flare events on five flaring stars from 185 polars. All the flares have bolometric energies above 1034 erg, with a median of ∼1035 erg, so they are superflares. Among them, two flares are followed by a brightness enhancement, which may suggest an accretion burst on the white dwarf caused by a coronal mass ejection. A completeness analysis of the detections demonstrates that the flare activities on the low-mass red dwarfs of polars are very similar to those on M dwarfs, which indicates that the highly magnetic fields of the white dwarfs have no significant effect on the magnetic activities on polars. We estimate that another ∼20–30 polars include a magnetically active secondary star, and more intensive searching for flares on polars is encouraged in further work.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用CRPropa框架解决了3D宇宙射线输运方程，并测试了两种不同的源分布和五种不同的扩散张量各向异性，覆盖了有效地沿磁场线扩散到各向同性扩散的范围。研究发现，在测试的磁场配置中，扩散张量的各向异性接近各向同性情况，并偏好于中央分子区域内的三个点源。未来的任务将需要更详细的3D气体分布和磁场结构。 <div>
The very high energy (VHE) emission of the central molecular zone (CMZ) is rarely modeled in 3D. Most approaches describe the morphology in 1D or simplify the diffusion to the isotropic case. In this work, we show the impact of a realistic 3D magnetic field configuration and gas distribution on the VHE γ-ray distribution of the CMZ. We solve the 3D cosmic-ray transport equation with an anisotropic diffusion tensor using the approach of stochastic differential equations as implemented in the CRPropa framework. We test two different source distributions for five different anisotropies of the diffusion tensor, covering the range of effectively fieldline-parallel diffusion to isotropic diffusion. Within the tested magnetic field configuration, the anisotropy of the diffusion tensor is close to the isotropic case, and three point sources within the CMZ are favored. Future missions such as the upcoming CTA will reveal more small-scale structures that are not yet included in the model. Therefore, a more detailed 3D gas distribution and magnetic field structure will be needed.

[C ii] 157.74 μm是远红外波段中最明亮和研究最充分的发射线之一，产生于星系星际介质(ISM)中。研究发现，[C ii]与H2的转换率与金属丰度呈弱相关，大部分[C ii]来自具有约n∼ 10 cm−3的原子气体。此外，[C ii]的强度与恒星形成速率(SFR)呈正相关，这与观测结果一致。因此，在金属贫穷的环境中，[C ii]是一种良好的SFR追踪器。解析密集(ISM)的多孔结构至关重要，因为它主导了[C ii] 157.74 μm的辐射。与光学薄极限相比，我们发现[C ii]线只有在我们假定的气体表面密度下的超太阳金属丰度时才会变得边缘光学厚。 <br /><br />总结: [C ii] 157.74 μm是星系星际介质中很重要的发射线，其特性与金属丰度相关，可用作SFR追踪器，对解析ISM的结构十分重要。 <div>
The [C ii] 157.74 μm fine-structure transition is one of the brightest and most well-studied emission lines in the far-infrared, produced in the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies. We study its properties in subparsec-resolution hydrodynamical simulations for an ISM patch with gas surface density of Σg = 10 M⊙ pc−2, coupled with time-dependent chemistry, far-ultraviolet dust and gas shielding, star formation, photoionization and supernova feedback, and full line radiative transfer. We find a [C ii]-to-H2 conversion factor that scales weakly with metallicity , where is the normalized metallicity relative to solar. The majority of [C ii] originates from atomic gas with hydrogen number density n ∼ 10 cm−3. The [C ii] line intensity positively correlates with the star formation rate (SFR), with a normalization factor that scales linearly with metallicity. We find that this is broadly consistent with z ∼ 0 observations. As such, [C ii] is a good SFR tracer even in metal-poor environments where molecular lines might be undetectable. Resolving the clumpy structure of the dense (n = 10−103 cm−3) ISM is important, as it dominates [C ii] 157.74 μm emission. We compare our full radiative transfer computation with the optically thin limit and find that the [C ii] line becomes marginally optically thick only at supersolar metallicity for our assumed gas surface density.

Turbulence in highly magnetized plasma can be relativistic and induce an electric field comparable to the background magnetic field. Such a strong electric field can affect the emission process of nonthermal electrons. As the first step toward elucidating the emission process in relativistic turbulence, we study the radiation process of electrons in relativistic circularly polarized Alfvén waves. While the induced electric field boosts the average energy of low-energy electrons with a Larmor radius smaller than the wavelength, the emissivity for such electrons is suppressed because of the elongated gyromotion trajectory. The trajectory of high-energy electrons is shaken by the small-scale electric field, which enhances the emissivity. Since the effective Lorentz factor of E × B drift is in the circularly polarized Alfvén waves, the deviation from the standard synchrotron emission is not so prominent. However, a power-law energy injection in the waves can produce a concave photon spectrum, which is similar to the GeV extra component seen in GRB spectra. If the turbulence electric field is responsible for the GeV extra component in GRBs, the estimates of the typical electron energy and magnetic field should be largely altered.

<title>A Channel to Form Fast-spinning Black Hole–Neutron Star Binary Mergers as Multimessenger Sources. II. Accretion-induced Spin-up</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this work, we investigate an alternative channel for the formation of fast-spinning black hole–neutron star (BHNS) binaries, in which super-Eddington accretion is expected to occur in accreting BHs during the stable mass transfer phase within BH-stripped helium (BH–He-rich) star binary systems. We evolve intensive MESA grids of close-orbit BH–He-rich star systems to systematically explore the projected aligned spins of BHs in BHNS binaries, as well as the impact of different accretion limits on the tidal disruption probability and electromagnetic (EM) signature of BHNS mergers. Most of the BHs in BHNS mergers cannot be effectively spun up through accretion if the accretion rate is limited to , where is the standard Eddington accretion limit. In order to reach high spins (e.g., χBH ≳ 0.5), the BHs are required to be born less massive (e.g., ≲3.0 M⊙) in binary systems with initial periods of ≲0.2–0.3 days and accrete material at . However, even under this high accretion limit, ≳6 M⊙ BHs are typically challenging to significantly spin up and generate detectable associated EM signals. Our population simulations suggest that different accretion limits have a slight impact on the ratio of tidal disruption events. However, as the accretion limit increases, the EM counterparts from the cosmological BHNS population can become bright overall.

<title>The Sun Remains Relatively Refractory Depleted: Elemental Abundances for 17,412 Gaia RVS Solar Analogs and 50 Planet Hosts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The element abundances of stars, particularly the refractory elements (e.g., Fe, Si, and Mg), play an important role in connecting stars to their planets. Most Sun-like stars do not have refractory abundance measurements since obtaining a large sample of high-resolution spectra is difficult with oversubscribed observing resources. In this work we infer abundances for C, N, O, Na, Mn, Cr, Si, Fe, Ni, Mg, V, Ca, Ti, Al, and Y for solar analogs with Gaia Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) spectra (R = 11,200) using TheCannon, a data-driven method. We train a linear model on a reference set of 34 stars observed by Gaia RVS with precise abundances measured from previous high-resolution spectroscopic efforts (R > 30,000–110,000). We then apply this model to several thousand Gaia RVS solar analogs. This yields abundances with average upper limit precisions of 0.04–0.1 dex for 17,412 stars, 50 of which are identified planet (candidate) hosts. We subsequently test the relative refractory depletion of these stars with increasing element condensation temperature compared to the Sun. The Sun remains refractory depleted compared to other Sun-like stars regardless of our current knowledge of the planets they host. This is inconsistent with theories of various types of planets locking up or sequestering refractories. Furthermore, we find no significant abundance differences between identified close-in giant planet hosts, giant planet hosts, and terrestrial/small planet hosts with the rest of the sample within our precision limits. This work demonstrates the utility of data-driven learning for future exoplanet composition and demographics studies.

<title>Winds and Disk Turbulence Exert Equal Torques on Thick Magnetically Arrested Disks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The conventional accretion disk lore is that magnetized turbulence is the principal angular momentum transport process that drives accretion. However, when dynamically important large-scale magnetic fields thread an accretion disk, they can produce mass and angular momentum outflows, known as winds, that also drive accretion. Yet, the relative importance of turbulent and wind-driven angular momentum transport is still poorly understood. To probe this question, we analyze a long-duration (1.2 × 105rg/c) simulation of a rapidly rotating (a = 0.9) black hole feeding from a thick (H/r ∼ 0.3), adiabatic, magnetically arrested disk (MAD), whose dynamically important magnetic field regulates mass inflow and drives both uncollimated and collimated outflows (i.e., winds and jets, respectively). By carefully disentangling the various angular momentum transport processes within the system, we demonstrate the novel result that disk winds and disk turbulence both extract roughly equal amounts of angular momentum from the disk. We find cumulative angular momentum and mass accretion outflow rates of and , respectively. This result suggests that understanding both turbulent and laminar stresses is key to understanding the evolution of systems where geometrically thick MADs can occur, such as the hard state of X-ray binaries, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei, some tidal disruption events, and possibly gamma-ray bursts.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a general procedure for deriving a line-profile model for massive-star X-ray spectra that captures the dynamics of the wind more directly. The basis of the model is the analytic solution to the problem of variable jets in Herbig–Haro objects given by Cantó et al. In deriving our model, we generalize this jet solution to include flows with a prescribed nonzero acceleration for the context of radiatively driven winds. We provide example line profiles generated from our model for the case of sinusoidal velocity and mass-ejection variations. The example profiles show the expected shape of massive-star X-ray emission lines, as well as interesting but complicated trends with the model parameters. This establishes the possibility that observed X-rays could be a result of temporal variations seeded at the wind base, rather than purely generated intrinsically within the wind volume, and can be described via a quantitative language that connects with the physical attributes of those variations, consistently with the downstream momentum-conserving nature of radiatively cooled shocked radial flows.

<title>The Effect of Spatially Varying Collision Frequency on the Development of the Rayleigh–Taylor Instability</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Rayleigh–Taylor (RT) instability is ubiquitously observed, yet has traditionally been studied using ideal fluid models. Collisionality can vary strongly across the fluid interface, and previous work demonstrates the necessity of kinetic models to completely capture dynamics in certain collisional regimes. Where previous kinetic simulations used spatially and temporally constant collision frequency, this work presents five-dimensional (two spatial, three velocity dimensions) continuum-kinetic simulations of the RT instability using a more realistic spatially varying collision frequency. Three cases of collisional variation are explored for two Atwood numbers: low to intermediate, intermediate to high, and low to high. The low-to-intermediate case exhibits no RT instability growth, while the intermediate-to-high case is similar to a fluid-limit kinetic case with interface widening biased toward the lower-collisionality region. A novel contribution of this work is the low-to-high collisionality case that shows significantly altered instability growth through an upward movement of the interface and damped spike growth due to increased free-streaming particle diffusion in the lower region. Contributions to the energy flux from the non-Maxwellian portions of the distribution function are not accessible to fluid models and are greatest in magnitude in the spike and regions of low collisionality. Increasing the Atwood number results in greater RT instability growth and reduced upward interface movement. Deviation of the distribution function from Maxwellian is inversely proportional to collision frequency and concentrated around the fluid interface. The linear phase of RT instability growth is well described by theoretical linear growth rates accounting for viscosity and diffusion.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Ultraviolet (UV) processing in the interstellar medium (ISM) induces the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. Aliphatics, including alkanes, are present in different interstellar environments, being prevalently formed in evolved stars; thus, the dehydrogenation by UV photoprocessing of alkanes plays an important role in the chemistry of the ISM, leading to the formation of unsaturated hydrocarbons and eventually to aromatics, the latter ubiquitously detected in the ISM. Here, through combined experimental results and ab initio calculations, we show that UV absorption (mainly at the Lyα emission line of hydrogen at 121.6 nm) promotes an alkane to an excited Rydberg state from where it evolves toward fragmentation, inducing the formation of olefinic C=C bonds, which are necessary precursors of aromatic hydrocarbons. We show that the photochemistry of aliphatics in the ISM does not primarily produce direct hydrogen elimination but preferential C–C photocleavage. Our results provide an efficient synthetic route for the formation of unsaturated aliphatics, including propene and dienes, and suggest that aromatics could be formed in dark clouds by a bottom-up mechanism involving molecular fragments produced by UV photoprocessing of aliphatics.

The fact that both and change in accordance with indicates that X-ray emission originates from the convection zone, while is proportional to the convection zone area. We found that EBXs with main-sequence components exhibit an upward and then a downward trend in both the – and M– relations, which is different from the monotonically decreasing trend shown by EBXs containing sub-giant and giant components. The magnetic activity level is negatively correlated with and stellar mass. Based on the magnetic dynamo model, the variations in the size and thickness of the surface convection zones can explain the observed relations. EBXs with main-sequence components have a similar RO– relationship to that of the binaries in the clusters as Praesepe and Hyade. We compared the X-ray radiation properties of EBXs with those of the X-ray-emitting contact binaries and found that EBXs have broader value ranges for and /Lbol).

Studies on the dynamics of solar filaments have significant implications for understanding their formation, evolution, and eruption, which are of great importance for space weather warning and forecasting. The Hα Imaging Spectrograph (HIS) on board the recently launched Chinese Hα Solar Explorer (CHASE) can provide full-disk solar Hα spectroscopic observations, which bring us an opportunity to systematically explore and analyze the plasma dynamics of filaments. The dramatically increased observation data require automated processing and analysis, which are impossible if dealt with manually. In this paper, we utilize the U-Net model to identify filaments and implement the Channel and Spatial Reliability Tracking algorithm for automated filament tracking. In addition, we use the cloud model to invert the line-of-sight velocity of filaments and employ the graph theory algorithm to extract the filament spine, which can advance our understanding of the dynamics of filaments. The favorable test performance confirms the validity of our method, which will be implemented in the following statistical analyses of filament features and dynamics of CHASE/HIS observations.

<div> 关键词: 等离子体流动, 涡度, 地磁尾迹, 太阳风, 能量传输<br />
总结: <br />
本研究分析了2009年3月23日05:50至06:30期间地球磁尾区域的等离子体流动涡度。通过对三颗近地卫星观测到的涡度不均匀分布情况进行分析，发现太阳风中的等离子体逐渐混入近地磁尾区。发现近地卫星观测到的流动涡度和磁偶极子的形成比中磁尾区的卫星观测早大约10分钟。进一步分析发现，涡度与磁场沿着的电流和能量传输之间存在关系，并且导致了电离层伪分裂极光。这表明流动涡度主要通过将质量和能量从太阳风传输到近磁尾区，然后向中磁尾区传播，并通过耗散其主要热能将其遇到的等离子体加热。这些结果揭示了在地磁活动较弱的情况下，在大空间尺度上等离子流涡度的质量混合、能量传输和耗散过程。 <div>
Plasma flow vorticity is ubiquitous in space and plays a key role in material mixing and energy transfer. The five THEMIS satellites orbiting in different regions of the terrestrial magnetotail provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the temporal–spatial evolution characteristics of a plasma flow vortex on large spatial scales. We present an analysis of the flow vorticity that occurred between 05:50 and 06:30 UT on 2009 March 23 during a quiet time of the terrestrial magnetotail. The uneven distributions of the density and temperature of the vortex observed by the three near-Earth satellites (THA, THD, and THE) indicate that the plasma in the solar wind gradually mixed into the near-Earth magnetotail through a series of nonequilibrium processes. Both the flow vortices and dipolarization observed by the three near-Earth satellites were about 10 minutes earlier than those observed by the two satellites (THB and THC) in the mid-magnetotail. Further analysis of the relationship between vorticity, field-aligned current, and energy transport reveals that the flow vortex interacted with the surrounding plasma during its tailward propagation. The field-aligned current related to the vorticity could only generate a pseudo-breakup of the aurora in the ionosphere. Thus, we speculate that this flow vortex mainly transports mass and energy from the solar wind to the near-magnetotail, propagates tailward to the mid-magnetotail, and heats the encountered plasma by dissipating its bulk flow and dominant thermal energy. These results shed light on the mass mixing, energy transport, and dissipation of the plasma flow vortex during quiet levels of geomagnetic activity on large spatial scales.

<div> 星际物质，ALMA，密度结构，SM1N，N6
<br />
这篇文章研究了位于Ophiuchus分子云中的密集星形成核SM1N和N6的密度和温度结构。他们利用辐射传输建模和模拟观测，分析了0.8、2和3毫米的多波段连续辐射。研究表明，SM1N最适合于具有高中心密度（n ∼ 10^8 cm−3）和内部过渡半径约为80-300天文单位的折断幂律或Plummer样式密度剖面。其自由落体时间仅为几×10^3年，排除了存在嵌入的第一静态核（FHSC）或原恒星的可能性。NH2D在SM1N内部可能受到了排除。非热速度分散从NH2D到N2H+和H2D+逐渐增加，可能追踪了在更高密度下的增加的（但仍处于亚音速）向心速度。在N6核区，他们确认了在0.8毫米连续辐射中发现的微弱嵌入式点源N6-mm。NH2D和N2D+避开了N6-mm，在100 au范围内，而H2D+在N6附近没有明显的检测。这些示踪剂的分布与年轻、温暖物体的加热一致。因此，N6-mm仍然是迄今为止发现的最佳FHSC候选体之一，尽管其观测（亚）毫米光度低于对FHSC的预测。 
<br /><br />总结: 本文通过ALMA对Ophiuchus分子云中的星形成核进行了研究。对SM1N进行了密度和温度结构的分析，结果表明它是一个动力学上不稳定的但仍然没有形成恒星的核。NH2D在高密度下可能受到排除。非热速度分散逐渐增加可能追踪了向心速度。对N6核区进行了确认，并发现N6-mm仍然是最佳的FHSC候选体之一。 <div>
We present new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) continuum and NH2D, N2D+, and H2D+ line emission at matched, ∼100 au resolution toward the dense star-forming cores SM1N and N6 within the Ophiuchus molecular cloud. We determine the density and temperature structure of SM1N based on radiative transfer modeling and simulated observations of the multiwavelength continuum emission at 0.8, 2, and 3 mm. We show that SM1N is best fit by either a broken power-law or Plummer-like density profile with high central densities (n ∼ 108 cm−3), and an inner transition radius of only ∼80–300 au. The free-fall time of the inner region is only a few ×103 yr. The continuum modeling rules out the presence of an embedded first hydrostatic core (FHSC) or protostar. SM1N is therefore a dynamically unstable but still starless core. We find that NH2D is likely depleted at high densities within SM1N. The nonthermal velocity dispersions increase from NH2D to N2H+ and H2D+, possibly tracing increasing (but still subsonic) infall speeds at higher densities as predicted by some models of starless core contraction. Toward N6, we confirm the previous ALMA detection of a faint, embedded point source (N6-mm) in 0.8 mm continuum emission. NH2D and N2D+ avoid N6-mm within ∼100 au, while H2D+ is not strongly detected toward N6. The distribution of these tracers is consistent with heating by a young, warm object. N6-mm thus remains one of the best candidate FHSCs detected so far, although its observed (sub)millimeter luminosity remains below predictions for FHSCs.

<div> XMM-Newton, Fe L-shell, 铁氧化物, 漫射星际介质, 光谱研究

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章使用了XMM-Newton反射光栅光谱仪对Cygnus X-1和GX 339-4方向的X射线双星漫射星际介质中的Fe L壳层消光进行了高分辨率光谱研究。研究发现铁氧化物可能是携带铁的尘埃颗粒的候选物质，但需要更精确的能量标度来验证。该研究提出了对铁氧化物进行新的绝对光吸收测量的需求。 <div>
We present a high-resolution spectral study of Fe L-shell extinction by the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) in the direction of the X-ray binaries Cygnus X-1 and GX 339–4, using the XMM-Newton reflection grating spectrometer. The majority of interstellar Fe is suspected to condense into dust grains in the diffuse ISM, but the compounds formed from this process are unknown. Here, we use the laboratory cross sections from Kortright & Kim (2000) and Lee et al. (2005) to model the absorption and scattering profiles of metallic Fe, and the crystalline compounds fayalite (Fe2SiO4), ferrous sulfate (FeSO4), hematite (α-Fe2O3), and lepidocrocite (γ-FeOOH), which have oxidation states ranging from Fe0 to Fe3+. We find that the observed Fe L-shell features are systematically offset in energy from the laboratory measurements. An examination of over two dozen published measurements of Fe L-shell absorption finds a 1–2 eV scatter in energy positions of the L-shell features. Motivated by this, we fit for the best energy-scale shift simultaneously with the fine structure of the Fe L-shell extinction cross sections. Hematite and lepidocrocite provide the best fits (≈ + 1.1 eV shift), followed by fayalite (≈ + 1.8 eV shift). However, fayalite is disfavored, based on the implied abundances and knowledge of ISM silicates gained by infrared astronomical observations and meteoritic studies. We conclude that iron oxides in the Fe3+ oxidation state are good candidates for Fe-bearing dust. To verify this, new absolute photoabsorption measurements are needed on an energy scale accurate to better than 0.2 eV.

<div> 太阳，微波辐射，恒星活动，关系，环极化 <br />
总结: 该研究调查了太阳微波辐射与其他活动指数之间的关系，发现这些关系可以分为两组。其中，微波辐射与活跃区域强相关的太阳指数可以通过线性函数很好地拟合。另一组中，拟合函数则依赖于频率。同时还首次提出了圆偏振与太阳指数的关系。此外，研究还将太阳微波辐射的关系外推到更高值并与类太阳恒星进行对比，发现恒星ϵ Eri的微波辐射符合外推关系。然而，仅有一个恒星的微波辐射被确认为热辐射，未来需要用射电干涉仪观测更多类太阳恒星，以确认基于太阳数据的关系是否适用于恒星微波数据。 <br /> <div>
Thermal microwave emissions detected from stellar atmospheres contain information on stellar activity. However, even for the Sun, the relationship between multifrequency microwave data and other activity indices remains unclear. We investigated the relationships among the thermal microwave fluxes with 1, 2, 3.75, and 9.4 GHz, their circular polarizations, and several activity indices recorded during recent solar cycles and observed that these relationships can be categorized into two groups. In the first group, the relationship between the microwave fluxes and solar indices, which are strongly related to the active regions, can be well-fitted by using a linear function. In the second group, the fitting function is dependent on frequency. Specifically, the microwave fluxes at 1 and 2 GHz can be well-fitted to the total unsigned magnetic and extreme ultraviolet fluxes by employing a power-law function. The trend changes around 3.75 GHz, and the trend for the 9.4 GHz fluxes can be fitted by using a linear function. For the first time, we present the relationship between circular polarization and solar indices. Moreover, we extrapolated these relationships of the solar microwave fluxes to higher values and compared them with the solar-type stars. We found that ϵ Eri, whose microwave emission originates from thermal plasma, follows the extrapolated relationship. However, to date, only one star’s emission at 1–10 GHz has been confirmed as thermal emission. More solar-type stars should be observed with future radio interferometers to confirm that relationships based on solar data can be applied to stellar microwave data.

<div> 高红移星系，紫外光度函数，星团生成率密度，PEARLS调查，星系演化<br />
<br />
本研究分析了PEARLS调查中的“空白”区域以及CEERS、GLASS、NGDEEP调查/领域的早期发布科学数据以及JADES的第一个数据释放，结合了严格的质量剔除和EAZY光度红移，从而获得了高红移星系的可靠选择和表征。在180平方弧分钟的区域内，我们确定了1046个高于红移6.5的候选星系，并利用这一样本研究了7.5<13.5之间的四个红移区间内的紫外光度函数。在z=8和z=9处测得的星系数密度与哈勃太空望远镜(HST)的过去观测结果相匹配。本研究的z=10.5测量结果介于早期詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜(JWST)结果和过去HST结果之间，表明宇宙差异可能是先前高密度测量的原因。然而，在z=12.5处的紫外明亮星系的数密度与模拟的预测相比较高。在检查这一时期星系的星团生成率密度时，我们的观测结果仍然与恒定星团生成效率基本一致，略低于先前使用JWST的早期估计，并支持z≤8的星系引发复离子化。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究通过对远距星系的紫外光度函数和星团生成率密度的分析，结合PEARLS调查及其他调查数据，发现在高于红移6.5的星系中，星系密度在不同红移区间有所不同。此外，还发现了星系的星团生成率密度与模拟结果存在差异，并且支持星系驱动的再离子化在z≤8时期。 <div>
We present an analysis of the ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) and star formation rate density of distant galaxies (7.5 < z < 13.5) in the “blank” fields of the Prime Extragalactic Areas for Reionization and Lensing Science (PEARLS) survey combined with Early Release Science data from the CEERS, GLASS, and NGDEEP surveys/fields and the first data release of JADES. We use strict quality cuts on EAZY photometric redshifts to obtain a reliable selection and characterization of high-redshift (z > 6.5) galaxies from a consistently processed set of deep, near-infrared imaging. Within an area of 180 arcmin2, we identify 1046 candidate galaxies at redshifts z > 6.5 and we use this sample to study the UV LF in four redshift bins between 7.5 < z < 13.5. The measured number density of galaxies at z = 8 and z = 9 matches those of past observations undertaken by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Our z = 10.5 measurements lie between early James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) results and past HST results, indicating cosmic variance may be the cause of previous high density measurements. However, the number densities of UV-luminous galaxies at z = 12.5 are high compared to predictions from simulations. When examining the star formation rate density of galaxies at this period, our observations are still largely consistent with a constant star formation efficiency, are slightly lower than previous early estimations using JWST, and support galaxy driven reionization at z ≤ 8.

主要研究了中等质量恒星演化过程中的核部结构及其混合特性，利用声学振动学的方法进行观测和模拟。结果表明随着质量从1.0 M⊙到1.2 M⊙，有效超越参数 αov,eff 呈增加趋势，但随后趋于平缓。这些研究成果对主序星球核心边界的研究提供了重要的参考。总结: 该研究利用声学振动学方法研究了恒星的演化过程中核心结构及混合特性，得出了αov,eff与质量的变化趋势，为主序星球核心边界的研究提供了重要参考。 <div>
Some physical processes that occur during a star's main-sequence evolution also affect its post-main-sequence evolution. It is well known that stars with masses above approximately 1.1 M⊙ have well-mixed convective cores on the main sequence; however, the structure of the star in the neighborhood of the convective core regions is currently underconstrained. We use asteroseismology to study the properties of the stellar core, in particular convective boundary mixing through convective overshoot, in such intermediate-mass stars. These core regions are poorly constrained by the acoustic (p) mode oscillations observed for cool main-sequence stars. Consequently, we seek fossil signatures of main-sequence core properties during the subgiant and early first-ascent red giant phases of evolution. During these stages of stellar evolution, modes of mixed character that sample the deep interior can be observed. These modes sample the parts of the stars that are affected by the main-sequence structure of these regions. We model the global and near-core properties of 62 subgiant and early first-ascent red giant branch stars observed by the Kepler, K2, and TESS space missions. We find that the effective overshoot parameter, αov,eff, increases from M = 1.0 M⊙ to M = 1.2 M⊙ before flattening out, although we note that the relationship between αov,eff and mass will depend on the incorporated modeling choices of internal physics and nuclear reaction network. We also situate these results within existing studies of main-sequence convective core boundaries.

Pulsar timing arrays have found evidence for a low-frequency gravitational-wave background (GWB). Assuming that the GWB is produced by supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), the next gravitational-wave (GW) signals astronomers anticipate are continuous waves (CWs) from single SMBHBs and their associated GWB anisotropy. The prospects for detecting CWs and anisotropy are highly dependent on the astrophysics of SMBHB populations. Thus, information from single sources can break degeneracies in astrophysical models and place much more stringent constraints than the GWB alone. We simulate and evolve SMBHB populations, model their GWs, and calculate their anisotropy and detectability. We investigate how varying components of our semianalytic model, including the galaxy stellar mass function, the SMBH–host galaxy relation (MBH–Mbulge), and the binary evolution prescription, impact the expected detections. The CW occurrence rate is greatest for few total binaries, high SMBHB masses, large scatter in MBH–Mbulge, and long hardening times. The occurrence rate depends most on the binary evolution parameters, implying that CWs offer a novel avenue to probe binary evolution. The most detectable CW sources are in the lowest frequency bin for a 16.03 yr PTA, have masses from ∼109 to 1010 M⊙, and are ∼1 Gpc away. The level of anisotropy increases with frequency, with the angular power spectrum over multipole modes ℓ varying in low-frequency Cℓ>0/C0 from ∼5 × 10−3 to ∼2 × 10−1, depending on the model; typical values are near current upper limits. Observing this anisotropy would support SMBHB models for the GWB over cosmological models, which tend to be isotropic.

The deposition of energy and momentum by supernova explosions has been subject to numerous studies in the past few decades. However, while there has been some work that focused on the transition from the adiabatic to the radiative stage of a supernova remnant (SNR), the late radiative stage and merging with the interstellar medium (ISM) have received little attention. Here, we use three-dimensional, hydrodynamic simulations, focusing on the evolution of SNRs during the radiative phase, considering a wide range of physical explosion parameters ( and ). We find that the radiative phase can be subdivided in four stages: A pressure-driven snowplow phase, during which the hot overpressurized bubble gas is evacuated and pushed into the cold shell; a momentum-conserving snowplow phase that is accompanied by a broadening of the shell; an implosion phase where cold material from the back of the shell is flooding the central vacuum; and a final cloud phase, during which the imploding gas is settling as a central, compact overdensity. The launching timescale for the implosion ranges from a few 100 kyr to a few Myr, while the cloud formation timescale ranges from a few to about 10 Myr. The highly chemically enriched clouds can become massive (Mcl ∼ 103–104M⊙) and self-gravitating within a few Myr after their formation, providing an attractive, novel pathway for supernova-induced star and planet formation in the ISM.

该研究使用Fermi大面积望远镜的观测数据报告了对射电星系NGC 6251的延伸γ射线发射的检测。最大似然分析结果显示，在8.1σ的置信水平下，射电形态模板比点状源描述更好地适配了观测数据，而叶片的贡献占总γ射线流量的50%以上。此外，γ射线能谱显示了核区和叶片区形状上的显著差异，核区呈现出曲线对数抛物线形状，而叶片呈现出幂律形式。长期γ射线光变曲线显示，核区和西北叶片区均未出现显著的通量变化。核区和西北叶片区的宽频谱能量分布可以用单区域轻子模型解释。核区的γ射线是由于同步辐射-自康普顿过程，而西北叶片区的γ射线被解释为宇宙背景辐射的逆康普顿发射。

We report the detection of extended γ-ray emission from lobes in the radio galaxy NGC 6251 using observation data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. The maximum likelihood analysis results show that a radio morphology template provides a better fit than a pointlike source description for the observational data at a confidence level of 8.1σ, and the contribution of lobes constitutes more than 50% of the total γ-ray flux. Furthermore, the γ-ray energy spectra show a significant disparity in shape between the core and lobe regions, with a curved log-parabola shape observed in the core region and a power-law form observed in the lobes. Neither the core region nor the northwest (NW) lobe displays significant flux variations in the long-term γ-ray light curves. The broadband spectral energy distributions of the core region and the NW lobe can be explained with a single-zone leptonic model. The γ-rays of the core region are due to the synchrotron-self-Compton process, while the γ-rays from the NW lobe are interpreted as inverse Compton emission of the cosmic microwave background.

Streamers bring gas from outer regions to protostellar systems and could change the chemical composition around protostars and protoplanetary disks. We have carried out mapping observations of carbon-chain species (HC3N, HC5N, CCH, and CCS) in the 3 mm and 7 mm bands toward the streamer flowing to the Class 0 young stellar object (YSO) Per-emb-2 with the Nobeyama 45 m radio telescope. A region with a diameter of ∼0.04 pc is located to the north at a distance of ∼20,500 au from the YSO. The streamer connects to this northern region, which is its origin. The reservoir has high density and low temperature ( cm−3, Tkin = 10 K), which are similar to those of early-stage starless cores. By comparison of the observed abundance ratios of CCS/HC3N to the chemical simulations, the reservoir and streamer are found to be chemically young. The total mass available for the streamer is derived to be 24–34 M⊙. It has been estimated that, if all of the gas in the reservoir were to accrete onto the Per-emb-2 protostellar system, the lifetime of the streamer would be (1.1–3.2) × 105 yr, suggesting that the mass accretion via the streamer would continue until the end of the Class I stage.

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) was foundational to the study of galaxy evolution, having revealed the bimodality of galaxies and the relationship between their structure and star-forming activity. However, ground-based optical surveys like SDSS are limited in resolution and depth, which may lead to biases or poor quality in the derived morphological properties, potentially impacting our understanding of how and why galaxies cease their star formation (quench). We use archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of ∼2000 SDSS objects to assess the reliability of SDSS-derived morphologies, taking advantage of both SDSS statistical samples and HST’s superior resolution and sensitivity. Single Sérsic fitting and bulge-disk decomposition is performed on HST images for direct comparison with SDSS results. Of the three catalogs of SDSS-derived morphologies considered, none is significantly more accurate or precise than the others. For disk-dominated galaxies (n < 2.5), global Sérsic indices (n) from Meert et al. (hereafter, M15) are preferred. For bulge-dominated galaxies (n > 2.5), Simard et al. (hereafter, S11) and M15 overestimate n by ∼20%, and derived global n from Blanton et al. are preferred. We provide an empirical relation to correct S11 global Sérsic indices. Global Reff from S11 overestimates Reff for the largest galaxies by 0.1 dex. Despite these moderate biases, SDSS-derived single-component parameters are generally significantly more robust than SDSS-derived two-component parameters. The bulge Sérsic index (nbulge) cannot be reliably constrained from SDSS imaging at all, whereas the bulge-to-total (B/T) ratio can be inferred from SDSS (provided that nbulge = 4 is enforced) but has a large random error of ∼0.2.

<title>Formation of Polar Crown Filament Magnetic Fields by Supergranular Helicity Injection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To understand the magnetic fields of the polar crown filaments (PCFs) at high latitudes near polar regions of the Sun, we perform magnetofrictional numerical simulations on the long-term magnetic evolution of bipolar fields with roughly east–west polarity inversion lines (PILs) in a 3D spherical wedge domain near polar regions. The Coriolis-effect-induced vortical motions at the boundaries of several supergranular cells inject magnetic helicity from the photospheric boundary into the solar atmosphere. Supergranular-scale helicity injection, transfer, and condensation produce strongly sheared magnetic fields. Magnetic reconnections at footpoints of the sheared fields produce magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) with helicity signs consistent with the observed hemispheric helicity rule. The cross-sectional area of MFRs exhibits an uneven distribution, resembling a “foot-node-foot” periodic configuration. Experiments with different tilt directions of PILs indicate that the PCFs preferably form along PILs with the western end close to the polar region. The bending of PILs caused by supergranular flows, forming S-shape (Z-shape) PIL segments, promotes the formation of dextral (sinistral) MFRs. The realistic magnetic models we obtained can serve as starting points for the study of the plasma formation and eruption of PCFs.

<title>White Dwarf Merger Remnants: The DAQ Subclass</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Four years after the discovery of a unique DAQ white dwarf with a hydrogen-dominated and carbon-rich atmosphere, we report the discovery of four new DAQ white dwarfs, including two that were not recognized properly in the literature. We find all five DAQs in a relatively narrow mass and temperature range of M = 1.14–1.19 M⊙ and Teff = 13,000–17,000 K. In addition, at least two show photometric variations due to rapid rotation with ≈10 minute periods. All five are also kinematically old, but appear photometrically young, with estimated cooling ages of about 1 Gyr based on standard cooling tracks, and their masses are roughly twice the mass of the most common white dwarfs in the solar neighborhood. These characteristics are smoking gun signatures of white dwarf merger remnants. Comparing the DAQ sample with warm DQ white dwarfs, we demonstrate that there is a range of hydrogen abundances among the warm DQ population and that the distinction between DAQ and warm DQ white dwarfs is superficial. We discuss the potential evolutionary channels for the emergence of the DAQ subclass, suggesting that DAQ white dwarfs are trapped on the crystallization sequence and may remain there for a significant fraction of the Hubble time.

<title>Shell-type Tidal Features Are More Frequently Detected in Slowly Rotating Early-type Galaxies than Stream- and Tail-type Features</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To enhance our understanding of the impact of galaxy mergers on the kinematics of early-type galaxies (ETGs), we examine differences in specific stellar angular momentum within the half-light radius ( ) among ETGs with different types of tidal features and those without such features. This is accomplished by categorizing tidal features, which serve as direct evidence of recent mergers, into shells, streams, and tails, through deep images from the DESI Legacy Survey, and by using MaNGA data for the analysis of the kinematics of 1244 ETGs at z < 0.055. We find that ETGs with tidal features typically have reduced values that are lower by 0.12 dex than ETGs without tidal features. ETGs with shells contribute most to the reduction in . Consequently, nearly half of ETGs with shells are classified as slow rotators, a fraction that is more than twice as high as that of ETGs with tails or streams, and over three times higher than that of ETGs without tidal features. These trends generally remain valid even when ETGs are divided into several mass bins. Our findings support the idea that radial mergers, which are more effective at reducing than circular mergers, are more closely associated with the formation of shells rather than streams or tails. The detection of shells in slightly more massive ETGs compared to streams and tails may be attributed to the fact that massive satellite galaxies are more likely to be accreted through radial orbits, due to the nature of dynamical friction.

<title>Constraining Protoplanetary Disk Winds from Forbidden Line Profiles with Simulation-based Inference</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Protoplanetary disks (PPDs) are sites of vigorous hydrodynamic processes, such as accretion and outflows, and ultimately establish the conditions for the formation of planets. The properties of disk outflows are often inferred through the analysis of forbidden emission lines. These lines contain multiple overlapping components, tracing different emission regions with different processes that excite them: a high-velocity component (tracing a jet), a broad low-velocity component (LVC; tracing inner disk wind), and a narrow LVC (tracing the outer disk wind). They are also heavily contaminated by background spectral features. All of these challenges call into question the traditional approach of fitting Gaussian components to the line profiles and cloud the physical interpretation of those components. We introduce a novel statistical technique to analyze emission lines in PPDs. Simulation-based inference is a computationally efficient machine-learning technique that produces posterior distributions of the parameters (e.g., magnetic field, radiation sources, and geometry) of a representative wind model when given a spectrum without any prior assumption about line shapes (e.g., symmetry). In this pathfinder study, we demonstrate that this technique indeed accurately recovers the parameters from simulated spectra without noise and background. Future work will provide an analysis of the observed spectra.

<title>Merger-tree-based Galaxy Matching: A Comparative Study across Different Resolutions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We introduce a novel halo/galaxy matching technique between two cosmological simulations with different resolutions, which utilizes the positions and masses of halos along their subhalo merger tree. With this tool, we conduct a study of resolution biases through the galaxy-by-galaxy inspection of a pair of simulations that have the same simulation configuration but different mass resolutions, utilizing a suite of IllustrisTNG simulations to assess the impact on galaxy properties. We find that, with the subgrid physics model calibrated for TNG100-1, subhalos in TNG100-1 (high resolution) have ≲0.5 dex higher stellar masses than their counterparts in the TNG100-2 (low resolution). It is also discovered that the subhalos with Mgas ∼ 108.5M⊙ in TNG100-1 have ∼0.5 dex higher gas mass than those in TNG100-2. The mass profiles of the subhalos reveal that the dark matter masses of subhalos in TNG100-2 converge well with those from TNG100-1, except within 4 kpc of the resolution limit. The differences in stellar mass and hot gas mass are most pronounced in the central region. We exploit machine learning to build a correction mapping for the physical quantities of subhalos from low- to high-resolution simulations (TNG300-1 and TNG100-1), which enables us to find an efficient way to compile a high-resolution galaxy catalog even from a low-resolution simulation. Our tools can easily be applied to other large cosmological simulations, testing and mitigating the resolution biases of their numerical codes and subgrid physics models.

<br /><br />总结:
这项研究通过完全动力学的粒子在电磁场中的模拟，研究了在介质内等离子体环境中镜不稳定性的非线性阶段以及随后的哨声和离子回旋波的激发。当镜模式达到非线性振幅时，哨声和离子回旋波同时出现，具有次优的振幅，在磁场强度低的区域沿B(t)近似平行传播。研究表明，激发的根源是被困在具有损失锥形分布的镜模式中的电子和离子的压力各向异性。我们还观察到，离子回旋波在非线性阶段中起着调节离子压力各向异性的重要作用。研究认为，即使在高β条件下，哨声和离子回旋波在镜不稳定性的后期阶段也是一个伴随特征，因此在ICM等天体环境中有望存在。我们还讨论了我们的研究结果对ICM中无碰撞加热和湍流耗散的意义。 <div>
Electron cyclotron waves (whistlers) are commonly observed in plasmas near Earth and the solar wind. In the presence of nonlinear mirror modes, bursts of whistlers, usually called lion roars, have been observed within low magnetic field regions associated with these modes. In the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters, the excitation of the mirror instability is expected, but it is not yet clear whether electron and ion cyclotron (IC) waves can also be present under conditions where gas pressure dominates over magnetic pressure (high β). In this work, we perform fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of a plasma subject to a continuous amplification of the mean magnetic field B(t) to study the nonlinear stages of the mirror instability and the ensuing excitation of whistler and IC waves under ICM conditions. Once mirror modes reach nonlinear amplitudes, both whistler and IC waves start to emerge simultaneously, with subdominant amplitudes, propagating in low-B regions, quasi-parallel to B(t). We show that the underlying source of excitation is the pressure anisotropy of electrons and ions trapped in mirror modes with loss-cone-type distributions. We also observe that IC waves play an essential role in regulating the ion pressure anisotropy at nonlinear stages. We argue that whistler and IC waves are a concomitant feature at late stages of the mirror instability even at high β, and therefore, expected to be present in astrophysical environments like the ICM. We discuss the implications of our results for collisionless heating and dissipation of turbulence in the ICM.

Kinematically persistent planes (KPPs) of satellites are fixed sets of satellites co-orbiting around their host galaxy, whose orbital poles are conserved and clustered across long cosmic time intervals. They play the role of “skeletons,” ensuring the long-term durability of positional planes. We explore the physical processes behind their formation in terms of the dynamics of the local cosmic web (CW), characterized via the so-called Lagrangian volumes (LVs) built up around two zoom-in, cosmological hydro-simulations of Milky Way–mass disk galaxy + satellites systems, where three KPPs have been identified. By analyzing the LV deformations in terms of the reduced tensor of inertia (TOI), we find an outstanding alignment between the LV principal directions and the KPP satellites’ orbital poles. The most compressive local mass flows (along the eigenvector) are strong at early times, feeding the so-called -structure, while the smallest TOI axis rapidly decreases. The -structure collapse marks the end of this regime and is the timescale for the establishment of satellite orbital pole clustering when the Universe is ≲4 Gyr old. KPP protosatellites aligned with are those whose orbital poles are either aligned from early times or have been successfully bent at -structure collapse. KPP satellites associated with tend to have early trajectories already parallel to . We show that KPPs can arise as a result of the ΛCDM-predicted large-scale dynamics acting on particular sets of protosatellites, the same dynamics that shape the local CW environment.

<div> AGN, U/LIRGs, [O IV], [Ne V], Compton-thick
总结:<br /><br />本研究探讨了在超/亮红外星系中几乎完全被周围物质覆盖的“埋藏”活动星系核（AGN），这些星系显示出窄线区的弱电离线。通过使用[O iv] 25.89或[Ne v] 14.32微米线与12微米AGN光度比率的指标，我们在30个局部U/LIRGs的AGN中发现了17个[O iv]-弱（L[O IV]/L12,AGN ≤ -3.0）或[Ne v]-弱（L[Ne V]/L12,AGN ≤ -3.4）的埋藏AGN候选者。对于[O iv]-弱的AGN，我们使用X射线多云环模型估算它们的Compton厚（CT;NH ≥ 1024 cm-2）材料的遮盖分数，平均值与U/LIRGs中的[O iv]-弱AGNs的CT AGNs比例一致，并且远大于Swift/Burst Alert Telescope（BAT）AGNs（23%±6%）。[O iv]-弱AGNs的比例从早期并购（早期）到晚期并购（晚期）增加。晚期并购的[O iv]-或[Ne v]-弱AGNs显示出比Swift/BAT AGNs更大的NH和Eddington比率（λEdd），最大的NH在≳1025 cm-2，接近CT材料的有效Eddington限制。这些结果表明（1）在埋藏AGNs中，周围物质受到高λEdd AGNs对CT遮蔽物的辐射力的调节，以及（2）它们的密集物质具有大的（~0.5±0.1），这可能是埋藏AGNs独特结构的一个原因，它们的物质量可能通过并购诱发从宿主星系中补给而维持。 <div>
We study “buried” active galactic nuclei (AGNs) almost fully covered by circumnuclear material in ultra/luminous infrared galaxies (U/LIRGs), which show weak ionized lines from narrow-line regions. Employing an indicator of a [O iv] 25.89 or [Ne v] 14.32 μm line to 12 μm AGN luminosity ratio, we find 17 buried AGN candidates that are [O iv]-weak (L[O IV]/L12,AGN ≤ −3.0) or [Ne v]-weak (L[Ne V]/L12,AGN ≤ −3.4) among 30 AGNs in local U/LIRGs. For the [O iv]-weak AGNs, we estimate their covering fractions of Compton-thick (CT; NH ≥ 1024 cm−2) material with an X-ray clumpy torus model to be on average. This value is consistent with the fraction of CT AGNs ( ) among the [O iv]-weak AGNs in U/LIRGs and much larger than that in Swift/Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) AGNs (23% ± 6%). The fraction of [O iv]-weak AGNs increases from (early) to (late mergers). Similar results are obtained with the [Ne v] line. The [O iv]- or [Ne v]-weak AGNs in late mergers show larger NH and Eddington ratios (λEdd) than those of the Swift/BAT AGNs, and the largest NH is ≳1025 cm−2 at , close to the effective Eddington limit for CT material. These suggest that (1) the circumnuclear material in buried AGNs is regulated by the radiation force from high-λEdd AGNs on the CT obscurers, and (2) their dense material with large (∼0.5 ± 0.1) in U/LIRGs is a likely cause of a unique structure of buried AGNs, whose amount of material may be maintained through merger-induced supply from their host galaxies.

总结:
该研究探讨了矮星系中的活动星系核（AGN）对流的发现，并使用紫外线吸收特征跟踪了三个矮星系中的出流。在两个对象中确认了出流，第三个对象中也可能探测到了出流。其中一个对象的出流被归因于照射电离，表明在矮星系尺度上有影响。与类似星形成速率的源中的星爆驱动出流相比，该出流速度更快，动能输出更高，可能提供负反馈。此外，在两个对象中检测到He iiλ1640发射线，表明可能有高度电离的AGN风。这些发现为矮星系中的AGN反馈提供了证据。 <div>
While stellar processes are believed to be the main source of feedback in dwarf galaxies, the accumulating discoveries of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in dwarf galaxies over recent years arouse the interest to also consider AGN feedback in them. Fast, AGN-driven outflows, a major mechanism of AGN feedback, have indeed been discovered in dwarf galaxies and may be powerful enough to provide feedback to their dwarf hosts. In this paper, we search for outflows traced by the blueshifted ultraviolet absorption features in three dwarf galaxies with AGN from the sample examined in our previous ground-based study. We confirm outflows traced by blueshifted absorption features in two objects and tentatively detect an outflow in the third object. In one object where the outflow is clearly detected in multiple species, photoionization modeling suggests that this outflow is located ∼0.5 kpc from the AGN, implying a galactic-scale impact. This outflow is much faster and possesses a higher kinetic energy outflow rate than starburst-driven outflows in sources with similar star formation rates, and is likely energetic enough to provide negative feedback to its host galaxy as predicted by simulations. Much broader (∼4000 km s−1) absorption features are also discovered in this object, which may have the same origin as that of broad absorption lines in quasars. Additionally, strong He iiλ1640 emission is detected in both objects where the transition falls in the wavelength coverage and is consistent with an AGN origin. In one of these two objects, a blueshifted He iiλ1640 emission line is clearly detected, likely tracing a highly ionized AGN wind.

总结:
本研究通过对2014年9月至10月期间太阳活动的演变进行综合分析，发现在这一时期观测到了显著的开放磁通量增加现象。我们首先发现了开放磁通量增加与太阳磁场的强关联，其皮尔逊相关系数达到了0.94。此外，我们还发现开放磁通量与太阳日冕孔的关联较好，尽管日冕孔仅包含了太阳总开放磁通量的14%至32%。然而，我们注意到开放磁通量的演变与日冕孔面积的演变并无关联。开放磁通量的暂时增加与太阳南极残留磁场的消失有关，这是由于几个月前大量活跃区的磁通向南极流动导致的。此外，我们的分析还暗示了开放磁通量增加与太阳第24个太阳活动周期中最大的活跃区的同时出现可能存在关联。通过这项研究，我们对2014年9月至10月期间观测到的开放磁通量强烈增加现象提供了深入的洞察。 <div>
Coronal holes are recognized as the primary sources of heliospheric open magnetic flux (OMF). However, a noticeable gap exists between in situ measured OMF and that derived from remote-sensing observations of the Sun. In this study, we investigate the OMF evolution and its connection to solar structures throughout 2014, with special emphasis on the period from September to October, where a sudden and significant OMF increase was reported. By deriving the OMF evolution at 1 au, modeling it at the source surface, and analyzing solar photospheric data, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the observed phenomenon. First, we establish a strong correlation between the OMF increase and the solar magnetic field derived from a potential-field source-surface model (ccPearson = 0.94). Moreover, we find a good correlation between the OMF and the open flux derived from solar coronal holes (ccPearson = 0.88), although the coronal holes only contain 14%–32% of the Sun’s total open flux. However, we note that while the OMF evolution correlates with coronal hole open flux, there is no correlation with the coronal hole area evolution (ccPearson = 0.0). The temporal increase in OMF correlates with the vanishing remnant magnetic field at the southern pole, caused by poleward flux circulations from the decay of numerous active regions months earlier. Additionally, our analysis suggests a potential link between the OMF enhancement and the concurrent emergence of the largest active region in solar cycle 24. In conclusion, our study provides insights into the strong increase in OMF observed during 2014 September–October.

<div> HOCS+, G+0.693-0.027, molecular cloud, column density, cosmic-ray ionization rates

在对G+0.693-0.027分子云进行超深的分子线谱观测中，首次在空间中探测到O-质子化的羰基硫化物（HOCS+）。通过对我们观测到的所有Ka=0跃迁的数据分析，得出了HOCS+的柱密度，并推导出相对于H2的分数丰度。与之相反的S-质子化异构体HSCO+未被探测到，并且我们得出其相对于H2的丰度上限。我们还对OCS和HOCS+的比值进行了研究，并发现了高值的宇宙射线电离率对于再现观测到的HOCS+丰度是必需的。此外，我们比较了不同星际环境中的O/S比率，并发现G+0.693-0.027是O/S比率最低的源。最后，我们观察到HOCO+/HOCS+的比率与其他O/S分子对的比率相一致，表明在这个云中S没有因大尺度冲击而明显流失，这与其他源不同，那些源中S的含量仍被困留在冰冷的尘埃颗粒上。


<br /><br />总结: 
1. 首次在G+0.693-0.027分子云中探测到O-质子化的羰基硫化物（HOCS+）。
2. 比较了HOCS+和HSCO+的丰度，并观察到高值的宇宙射线电离率对于再现观测到的HOCS+丰度是必需的。

We present the first detection in space of O-protonated carbonyl sulfide (HOCS+), in the midst of an ultradeep molecular line survey toward the G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud. From the observation of all Ka = 0 transitions ranging from Jlo = 2 to Jlo = 13 of HOCS+ covered by our survey, we derive a column density of N = (9 ± 2) × 1012 cm−2, translating into a fractional abundance relative to H2 of ∼7 × 10−11. Conversely, the S-protonated HSCO+ isomer remains undetected, and we derive an upper limit to its abundance with respect to H2 of ≤3 × 10−11, a factor of ≥2.3 less abundant than HOCS+. We obtain an HOCS+/OCS ratio of ∼2.5 × 10−3, in good agreement with the prediction of astrochemical models. These models show that one of the main chemical routes to the interstellar formation of HOCS+ is likely the protonation of OCS, which appears to be more efficient at the oxygen end. Also, we find that high values of cosmic-ray ionization rates (10−15–10−14 s−1) are needed to reproduce the observed abundance of HOCS+. In addition, we compare the O/S ratio across different interstellar environments. G+0.693-0.027 appears as the source with the lowest O/S ratio. We find an HOCO+/HOCS+ ratio of ∼31, in accordance with other O/S molecular pairs detected toward this region and also close to the O/S solar value (∼37). This fact indicates that S is not significantly depleted within this cloud due to the action of large-scale shocks, unlike in other sources where S-bearing species remain trapped on icy dust grains.

总结: 本研究考察了引力波源在mHz频段产生爆发的可能性，并发现在本地宇宙中，mHz爆发源的数量可能会很大。研究估计，银河系中可能有3-45对爆发式双黑洞，并且在LISA任务期间可能会检测到约102-104次爆发。此外，研究发现爆发源的数量强烈依赖于它们的形成历史。如果某些地区在最近几百万年内形成了紧凑天体双星，爆发源的比例会显著提高。因此，mHz引力波爆发的检测不仅有助于区分不同的形成途径，还能帮助我们了解银河系不同地区的恒星形成历史。<br /><br /> <div>
The dynamical formation channels of gravitational wave (GW) sources typically involve a stage when the compact object binary source interacts with the environment, which may excite its eccentricity, yielding efficient GW emission. For the wide eccentric compact object binaries, the GW emission happens mostly near the pericenter passage, creating a unique, burst-like signature in the waveform. This work examines the possibility of stellar-mass bursting sources in the mHz band for future LISA detections. Because of their long lifetime (∼107 yr) and promising detectability, the number of mHz bursting sources can be large in the local Universe. For example, based on our estimates, there will be ∼3–45 bursting binary black holes in the Milky Way, with ∼102–104 bursts detected during the LISA mission. Moreover, we find that the number of bursting sources strongly depends on their formation history. If certain regions undergo active formation of compact object binaries in the recent few million years, there will be a significantly higher bursting source fraction. Thus, the detection of mHz GW bursts not only serves as a clue for distinguishing different formation channels, but also helps us understand the star formation history in different regions of the Milky Way.

<div> dark matter, galaxy clusters, spatial distribution, dynamical evolution, BCG+ICL

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了利用加权重叠系数（WOC）比较暗物质、成员星系、气体和星团内光（ICL）等组件之间的空间分布，以研究星系团的动力学演化。研究发现，在更放松的星系团中，气体和BCG+ICL与暗物质的分布非常相似，尤其是在主要合并期间。此外，BCG+ICL对星系团动力学状态的变化具有敏感性，并且可以通过缩放BCG+ICL的径向分布来近似恢复暗物质分布。研究还发现，在未放松的星系团中，包括最大的卫星星系与BCG+ICL分布可以增强暗物质追踪能力。因此，研究得出BCG+ICL分布是暗物质分布的有效示踪器，而空间分布的相似性可作为星系团动力学状态的有用探针。 <div>
One intriguing approach for studying the dynamical evolution of galaxy clusters is to compare the spatial distributions among various components such as dark matter, member galaxies, gas, and intracluster light (ICL). Utilizing the recently introduced weighted overlap coefficient (WOC), we analyze the spatial distributions of components within 174 galaxy clusters (Mtot > 5 × 1013M⊙, z = 0.625) at varying dynamical states in the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Horizon Run 5. We observe that the distributions of gas and the combination of ICL with the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) closely resembles the dark matter distribution, particularly in more relaxed clusters, characterized by the half-mass epoch. The similarity in spatial distribution between dark matter and BCG+ICL mimics the changes in the dynamical state of clusters during a major merger. Notably, at redshifts >1, BCG+ICL traced dark matter more accurately than the gas. Additionally, we examined the one-dimensional radial profiles of each component, which show that the BCG+ICL is a sensitive component revealing the dynamical state of clusters. We propose a new method that can approximately recover the dark matter profile by scaling the BCG+ICL radial profile. Furthermore, we find a recipe for tracing dark matter in unrelaxed clusters by including the most massive satellite galaxies together with the BCG+ICL distribution. Combining the BCG+ICL and the gas distribution enhances the dark matter tracing ability. Our results imply that the BCG+ICL distribution is an effective tracer for the dark matter distribution, and the similarity of the spatial distribution may be a useful probe of the dynamical state of a cluster.

<div> 加速过程，磁层高能电子，HILDCAA事件，太阳风，Van Allen Probe卫星

总结:
加速过程中，高能电子受HILDCAA事件影响，在L值为4.0-6.0的区域获得加速，这一过程发生在HILDCAA事件开始后2.9-3.4天，主要由磁层电磁合唱波与次暴注入的约100keV电子之间的波粒相互作用引起。随着HILDCAA和合唱波的持续时间越长，加速到更高能量的高能电子也越多，这种加速过程是一种自举机制。 <div>
Magnetospheric relativistic electrons are accelerated during substorms and strong convection events that occur during high-intensity long-duration continuous auroral electrojet activity (HILDCAA) events, associated with solar wind high-speed streams (coming from coronal holes). From an analysis of ∼2–20 MeV electrons at L ∼ 2–7 measured by the Van Allen Probe satellite, it is shown that ∼3.4–4.1 days long HILDCAA events are characterized by ∼7.2 MeV electron acceleration in the L ∼ 4.0–6.0 region, which occurs ∼2.9–3.4 days after the onset of HILDCAA. The dominant acceleration process is due to wave–particle interactions between magnetospheric electromagnetic chorus waves and substorm-injected ∼100 keV electrons. The longer the HILDCAA and chorus last, the higher the maximum energy of the accelerated relativistic electrons. The acceleration to higher and higher energies is due to a bootstrap mechanism.

文章报告了在PSR J0344−0901中探测到的两种现象。第一种现象表现为脉冲发射向较晚的纵向相位移动，然后逐渐返回到原来的位置，持续约216个脉冲周期，平均偏移量约为0.°7。在脉冲轮廓的尖峰处检测到偏振位置角（PPA）的变化，以及脉冲轮廓宽度的增加。第二种现象是亚脉冲的明显移动，导致在轮廓窗口内出现不同的亚脉冲轨迹模式。首次识别出四种发射模式，并确定其中三种的模式周期。未检测到脉冲消失。使用旋转向量模型对PPA的变化进行建模得到该脉冲星的倾斜角为75.°12 ± 3.°80，冲击参数为-3.°17 ± 5.°32。我们推测亚脉冲的移动可能与脉冲发射的移动有关。 <br /><br />总结: 本文报道了在PSR J0344−0901中观测到的两种现象，即脉冲发射的移动和亚脉冲的移动。同时鉴定了四种发射模式，并对其进行了分析。通过对偏振位置角的建模，得到了该脉冲星的倾斜角和冲击参数。对亚脉冲移动与脉冲发射移动的关联进行了推测。 <div>
We report two phenomena detected in PSR J0344−0901 from two observations conducted at frequencies centered at 1.25 GHz using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope. The first phenomenon manifests as the pulse emission shifting to later longitudinal phases and then gradually returning to its original location. The event lasts for about 216 pulse periods, with an average shift of about 0.°7 measured at the peak of the integrated profile. Changes in the polarization position angle (PPA) are detected around the trailing edge of the profile, together with an increase in the profile width. The second phenomenon is characterized by the apparent movement of subpulses, which results in different subpulse track patterns across the profile window. For the first time in this pulsar, we identify four emission modes, each with unique subpulse movement, and determine the pattern periods for three of them. Pulse nulling was not detected. Modeling of the changes in the PPA using the rotating vector model gives an inclination angle of 75.°12 ± 3.°80 and an impact parameter of −3.°17 ± 5.°32 for this pulsar. We speculate that the subpulse movement may be related to the shifting of the pulse emission.

<title>The Cosmic Ultraviolet Baryon Survey (CUBS). VIII. Group Environment of the Most Luminous Quasars at z ≈ 1</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad2fad</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the group-scale environment of 15 luminous quasars (luminosity L3000 > 1046 erg s−1) from the Cosmic Ultraviolet Baryon Survey (CUBS) at redshift z ≈ 1. Using the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer integral field spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope, we conduct a deep galaxy redshift survey in the CUBS quasar fields to identify group members and measure the physical properties of individual galaxies and galaxy groups. We find that the CUBS quasars reside in diverse environments. The majority (11 out of 15) of the CUBS quasars reside in overdense environments with typical halo masses exceeding 1013M⊙, while the remaining quasars reside in moderate-size galaxy groups. No correlation is observed between overdensity and redshift, black hole (BH) mass, or luminosity. Radio-loud quasars (5 out of 15 CUBS quasars) are more likely to be in overdense environments than their radio-quiet counterparts in the sample, consistent with the mean trends from previous statistical observations and clustering analyses. Nonetheless, we also observe radio-loud quasars in moderate groups and radio-quiet quasars in overdense environments, indicating a large scatter in the connection between radio properties and environment. We find that the most UV luminous quasars might be outliers in the stellar mass-to-halo mass relations or may represent departures from the standard single-epoch BH relations.

<title>Investigating Ionization in the Intergalactic Medium</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The intergalactic medium (IGM) contains >50% of the baryonic mass of the Universe, yet the mechanisms responsible for keeping the IGM ionized have not been fully explained. Hence, we investigate ion abundances from the largest blind QSO absorption catalog for clouds that show C iv, N v, and O vi simultaneously. The wavelength range of present UV spectrographs, however, makes it possible to probe C iv and O vi only over a small range of redshift (z ≈ 0.12–0.15). As a result, we only have five IGM absorbing clouds, yet these provide a powerful and representative tool to probe the IGM ionization state. We found one cloud to be in collisional ionization equilibrium while three of the five showed signs of being produced by nonequilibrium processes, specifically conductive interfaces and turbulent mixing layers. None of the models we explore here were able to reproduce the ionization state of the remaining system. Energetic processes, such as galactic feedback from star formation and active galactic nucleus winds, would be excellent candidates that can cause such widespread ionization.

<title>Low-mass Population III Star Formation due to the HD Cooling Induced by Weak Lyman–Werner Radiation</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad2fc9</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Lyman–Werner (LW) radiation photodissociating molecular hydrogen (H2) influences the thermal and dynamical evolution of the Population III (Pop III) star-forming gas cloud. The effect of powerful LW radiation has been well investigated in the context of supermassive black hole formation in the early Universe. However, the average intensity in the early Universe is several orders of magnitude lower. For a comprehensive study, we investigate the effects of LW radiation at 18 different intensities, ranging from JLW/J21 = 0 (no radiation) to 30 (H-cooling cloud), on the primordial star-forming gas cloud obtained from a three-dimensional cosmological simulation. The overall trend with increasing radiation intensity is a gradual increase in the gas cloud temperature, consistent with previous works. Due to the HD cooling, however, the dependence of gas cloud temperature on JLW deviates from the aforementioned increasing trend for a specific range of intensities (JLW/J21 = 0.025–0.09). In HD-cooling clouds, the temperature remained below 200 K during 105 yr after the first formation of the high-density region, maintaining a low accretion rate. Finally, the HD-cooling clouds have only a low-mass dense core (above 108 cm−3) with about 1–16 M⊙, inside of which a low-mass Pop III star with ≤0.8 M⊙ (a so-called “surviving star”) could form. The upper limit of star formation efficiency significantly decreases from 10−3 to 10−5 as HD cooling becomes effective. This tendency indicates that, whereas the total gas mass in the host halo increases with the LW radiation intensity, the total Pop III stellar mass does not increase similarly.

NICER has observed a few millisecond pulsars where the geometry of the X-ray-emitting hotspots on the neutron star have been analyzed in order to constrain the mass and radius from X-ray light-curve modeling. One example, PSR J0030 + 0451, has been shown to possibly have significant multipolar magnetic fields at the stellar surface. Using force-free simulations of the magnetosphere structure, it has been shown that the radio, X-ray, and γ-ray light curves can be modeled simultaneously with an appropriate field configuration. An even more stringent test is to compare predictions of the force-free magnetosphere model with observations of radio polarization. This paper attempts to reproduce the radio polarization of PSR J0030 + 0451 using a force-free magnetospheric solution. As a result of our modeling, we can reproduce certain features of the polarization well.

<title>Observation of Kinetic Alfvén Waves inside an Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection Magnetic Cloud at 1 au</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent advancements have significantly enhanced our grasp of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) in the heliosphere. These observations have uncovered complex kinematics and structural deformations in ICMEs, hinting at the possible generation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and kinetic-scale waves. While MHD-scale waves in magnetic clouds have been explored, understanding the dynamics of kinetic-scale mode waves remains challenging. This article demonstrates the first in situ observation of kinetic Alfvén waves (KAWs) within an ICME’s magnetic cloud, notably near the heliospheric current sheet–ICME interaction region, close to the reconnection exhaust. Analysis indicates a distinctive negative bump in the estimated normalized magnetic helicity (σm = −0.38) around the gyrofrequency spread, indicating a right-handed polarization of the wave. Furthermore, examination across flow angle (θVB) within the frequency domain reveals a specific zone (90°–135°) showcasing negative helicity fluctuations, confirming the presence of KAWs. Moreover, we noted a significant rise in temperature anisotropy in the vicinity, indicating the role of KAWs in plasma heating. Identifying KAW challenges established notions about ordered magnetic clouds and raises questions about energy transfer processes within these structures. This finding opens the door to a deeper understanding of energy transfer mechanisms within traditionally nondissipative regions and invites further exploration of low-beta plasma heating and the interactions between waves and particles in magnetic clouds.

<title>Astrometric Microlensing by Primordial Black Holes with the Roman Space Telescope</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Primordial black holes (PBHs) could explain some fraction of dark matter and shed light on many areas of early-Universe physics. Despite over half a century of research interest, a PBH population has so far eluded detection. The most competitive constraints on the fraction of dark matter comprised of PBHs (fDM) in the (10−9–10)M⊙ mass ranges come from photometric microlensing and bound fDM ≲ 10−2–10−1. With the advent of the Roman Space Telescope with its submilliarcsecond astrometric capabilities and its planned Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS), detecting astrometric microlensing signatures will become routine. Compared with photometric microlensing, astrometric microlensing signals are sensitive to different lens masses–distance configurations and contain different information, making it a complimentary lensing probe. At submilliarcsecond astrometric precision, astrometric microlensing signals are typically detectable at larger lens–source separations than photometric signals, suggesting a microlensing detection channel of pure astrometric events. We use a Galactic simulation to predict the number of detectable microlensing events during the GBTDS via this pure astrometric microlensing channel. Assuming an absolute astrometric precision floor for bright stars of 0.1 mas for the GBTDS, we find that the number of detectable events peaks at ≈103fDM for a population of 1M⊙ PBHs and tapers to ≈10fDM and ≈100fDM at 10−4M⊙ and 103M⊙, respectively. Accounting for the distinguishability of PBHs from stellar lenses, we conclude the GBTDS will be sensitive to a PBH population at fDM down to ≈10−1–10−3 for (10−1–102)M⊙ likely yielding novel PBH constraints.

<title>The Slipping Magnetic Reconnection and Damped Quasiperiodic Pulsations in a Circular Ribbon Flare</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The study of circular ribbon (CR) flares is important to understand the three-dimensional magnetic reconnection in the solar atmosphere. We investigate the slipping brightenings and damped quasiperiodic pulsations in a CR flare by multiwavelength observations. During the flaring process, two extreme ultraviolet brightenings (SP1 and SP2) slip synchronously along the ribbon in a counterclockwise direction. The ribbon and fans between them show synchronous enhancement with the microwave and hard X-ray (HXR) CR source. In the magnetohydrostatic extrapolation results and observations, the dome and outer spine display an evident counterclockwise twisting feature. We propose the slipping reconnection occurs between the fan and outer spine in the null point, which covers the region from SP1 to SP2. The fan of SP1 shows the strongest twist and produces the most efficient reconnection. The ribbon after SP1 becomes weak due to the destruction of the fan configuration. The fan of SP2 is in the front of the slipping motion, which initiates new reconnection and brightens the local ribbon. The twisting of the dome continuously promotes new reconnection in the null point, which brightens the ribbon in sequence to display a counterclockwise slipping feature. Thus, the twist of the dome may trigger and dominate the slipping reconnection, and the rotation of the central positive pole could be one possible cause of the twist. After the peak, the microwave and HXR emission shows damped oscillations at a period of 15 s. The collapse of the fan–spine structure may lead to the standing kink oscillations of the fan to modulate the reconnection and particle acceleration process.

<title>Solar Chromospheric Heating by Magnetohydrodynamic Waves: Dependence on the Inclination of the Magnetic Field</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad343f</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad343f</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A proposed mechanism for solar chromospheric heating is magnetohydrodynamic waves propagating upward along magnetic field lines and dissipating their energy in the chromosphere. In particular, compressible magnetoacoustic waves may contribute to the heating. Theoretically, the components below the cutoff frequency cannot propagate into the chromosphere; however, the cutoff frequency depends on the inclination of the magnetic field lines. In this study, using high-temporal cadence spectral data of IRIS and Hinode Solar Optical Telescope spectropolarimeter in plages, we investigated the dependence of the low-frequency waves on magnetic field properties and quantitatively estimated the amount of energy dissipation in the chromosphere. The following results were obtained: (a) The amount of energy dissipated by the low-frequency component (3–6 mHz) increases with the inclination of the field below 40°, whereas it decreases as a function of the inclination of the field above 40°. (b) The amount of the energy is enhanced toward 104 W m−2, which is the energy required for heating in the chromospheric plage regions when the magnetic field is higher than 600 G and inclined more than 40°. (c) In the photosphere, the low-frequency component has much more power in the magnetic field inclined more and weaker than 400 G. The results suggest that the observed low-frequency components can bring the energy along the magnetic field lines and that only a specific range of the inclination angles of the field and the strength of the field may allow the low-frequency component to bring a sufficient amount of the energy into the chromosphere.

We present the first detection of 13CCH in a protoplanetary disk (TW Hya). Using observations of C2H, we measure CCH/13CCH = 65 ± 20 gas with a CO isotopic ratio of 12CO/13CO = 21 ± 5. The TW Hya disk exhibits a gas phase C/O that exceeds unity, and C2H is the tracer of this excess carbon. We confirm that the TW Hya gaseous disk exhibits two separate carbon isotopic reservoirs, as noted previously. We explore two theoretical solutions for the development of this dichotomy. One model represents TW Hya today with a protoplanetary disk exposed to a cosmic-ray ionization rate that is below interstellar as consistent with current estimates. We find that this model does not have sufficient ionization in cold (T < 40 K) layers to activate carbon isotopic fractionation. The second model investigates a younger TW Hya protostellar disk exposed to an interstellar cosmic-ray ionization rate. We find that the younger model has sources of ionization deeper in a colder disk that generates two independent isotopic reservoirs. One reservoir is 12C-enriched carried by methane/hydrocarbon ices, and the other is 13C-enriched carried by gaseous CO. The former potentially provides a source of methane/hydrocarbon ices to power the chemistry that generates the anomalously strong C2H emission in this (and other) disk systems in later stages. The latter provides a source of gaseous 13C-rich material to generate isotopic enrichments in forming giant planets, as recently detected in the super-Jupiter TYC 8998-760-1 b by Zhang et al.

We detected a giant X-ray flare from the RS CVn–type binary star UX Ari using the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image on 2020 August 17 and started a series of Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer observations 89 minutes later. For a week, the entire duration of the flare was covered with 32 snapshot observations including the rising phase. The X-ray luminosity reached 2 × 1033 erg s−1, and the entire energy release was ∼1038 erg in the 0.5–8.0 keV band. X-ray spectra characterized by continuum emission with lines of Fe xxv Heα and Fe xxvi Lyα were obtained. We found that the temperature peaks before the flux does, which suggests that the period of plasma formation in the magnetic flare loop was captured. Using the continuum information (temperature, flux, and their delay time), we estimated the flare loop size to be ∼3 × 1011 cm and the peak electron density to be ∼4 × 1010 cm−3. Furthermore, using the line ratio of Fe xxv and Fe xxvi, we investigated any potential indications of deviation from collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE). The X-ray spectra were consistent with CIE plasma throughout the flare, but the possibility of an ionizing plasma away from CIE was not rejected in the flux rising phase.

<div> PG 1553+113, blazar, quasiperiodic oscillation, 2.2 yr, 22 yr
<br /><br />
PG 1553+113是一个著名的类星体，显示出∼2.2年的准周期振荡(QPO)迹象，这一周期在射电、光学、X射线和γ射线波段均有观测数据支持。研究对其历史光学光变曲线进行了一个世纪的观测，发现了约21.8 ± 4.7年的振荡。尽管这∼22年周期本身的统计显著性只有1.6σ，考虑了观测多处效应后的联合显著性却达到了约3.6σ。22年振荡的次一个峰值预计出现在2025年7月左右。研究还发现，PG 1553+113的两个QPO可以在一个合理的超大质量黑洞二元模型中得到解释，该二元系统的质量比≳0.2，偏心率≲0.1，并从一个特征高度比约0.03的盘吸积。这个假设的二元系统会辐射nHz级别的引力波，但其振幅约为现有脉冲星定时阵列所能检测到的10-100倍。 <div>
PG 1553+113 is a well-known blazar exhibiting evidence of a ∼2.2 yr quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) in the radio, optical, X-ray, and γ-ray bands. Since QPO mechanisms often predict multiple QPOs, we search for a second QPO in its historical optical light curve covering a century of observations. Despite challenging data quality issues, we find hints of a 21.8 ± 4.7 yr oscillation. On its own, this ∼22 yr period has a modest statistical significance of 1.6σ when accounting for the look-elsewhere effect. However, the joint significance of both the 2.2 and 22 yr periods arising from colored noise alone is ∼3.6σ. The next peak of the 22 yr oscillation is predicted to occur around July 2025. We find that such a ∼10:1 relation between two periods can arise in the gas dynamics of a plausible supermassive black hole binary model of PG 1553+113. While the 22 yr QPO is preliminary, an interpretation of PG 1553+113's two QPOs in this binary model suggests that the binary engine has a mass ratio ≳0.2, an eccentricity ≲0.1, and accretes from a disk with characteristic aspect ratio ∼0.03. The putative binary radiates nHz gravitational waves, but the amplitude is ∼10–100 times too low for detection by foreseeable pulsar timing arrays.

<div> 高红移Lyα森林，离子透过现象，平均自由程ABC推断
总结:
高红移Lyα森林的观测数据显示出强烈的变化，不能仅仅归因于密度场的波动。文章提出了两种模型：一种是在红移6以下进行的晚期复电离过程的假设；另一种是与离子化光子的平均自由程和强离子化背景辐射波动有关的模型。通过ABC推断技术对XQR-30在z = 5.0–6.1的有效光学深度分布进行联合约束，推断出观测数据与平均自由程具有波动的模型相吻合，而且平均自由程的平均值与独立测量结果一致，在z ∼ 5–6时有明显的演变，伴随着光电离速率的快速演化。 <div>
The variations in Lyα forest opacity observed at z > 5.3 between lines of sight to different background quasars are too strong to be caused by fluctuations in the density field alone. The leading hypothesis for the cause of this excess variance is a late, ongoing reionization process at redshifts below six. Another model proposes strong ionizing background fluctuations coupled to a short, spatially varying mean free path of ionizing photons, without explicitly invoking incomplete reionization. With recent observations suggesting a short mean free path at z ∼ 6, and a dramatic improvement in z > 5 Lyα forest data quality, we revisit this latter possibility. Here, we apply the likelihood-free inference technique of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to jointly constrain the hydrogen photoionization rate ΓHI and the mean free path of ionizing photons λmfp from the effective optical depth distributions at z = 5.0–6.1 from XQR-30. We find that the observations are well-described by fluctuating mean free path models with average mean free paths that are consistent with the steep trend implied by independent measurements at z ∼ 5–6, with a concomitant rapid evolution of the photoionization rate.

<br />总结: 本研究通过进行八个数量级的电阻率参数研究，探讨了振荡再连接机制的演变以及与空间奇点相关的周期性。通过在不同电阻率水平下对抗性的非线性MHD模拟的解决，采用小波分析、傅立叶变换和ANOVA三种方法研究电阻率与结果周期之间的影响。结果发现背景电阻率水平与振荡再连接机制的周期之间存在独立性。相反，电阻率对当前密度的最大幅值和其衰减速率的性质以及空间奇点处欧姆加热的大小都有显著影响。 <div>
The oscillatory reconnection mechanism is investigated for a parameter study of eight orders of magnitude of resistivity, with a particular interest in the evolution of the oscillating current density at the null point and its associated periodicity. The resistive, nonlinear MHD simulations are solved in 2.5D for different levels of resistivity. Three methods (wavelet analysis, Fourier transform, and ANOVA) are used to investigate the effect of resistivity versus resultant period. It is found that there is an independence between the level of background resistivity and the period of the oscillatory reconnection mechanism. Conversely, it is found that resistivity has a significant effect on the maximum amplitude of the current density and the nature of its decay rate, as well as the magnitude of ohmic heating at the null.

<div> Cepheids, Gaia Data Release 3, kinematics, Galactic warp, precession rate
<br /><br />
Classical Cepheids (CCs) are used to study the kinematics of the Milky Way using data from Gaia Data Release 3. The 3D velocities of 2057 CCs relative to the Galactic center are determined, revealing differences in the VR and Vϕ velocities of the northern and southern warps. This may be related to warp precession or asymmetry in warp structure. The vertical velocities of CCs are found to be more suitable for constraining the warp precession rate. Based on spatial structure parameters, a warp precession rate of ω = 4.9 ± 1.6 km s−1 kpc−1 at 13 kpc is determined, supporting a low precession rate in the warp model. More kinematic information on CCs will help to better constrain the structure and evolution of the Milky Way in the future.

经典可变星、盖亚数据发布3、运动学、银河扭曲、进动速率。研究使用盖亚数据发布3中的经典可变星数据来了解银河系的运动学，通过对2057颗经典可变星的3D速度进行分析发现，南北扭曲的径向速度和方位速度存在差异，可能与扭曲的进动或结构不对称有关。同时发现，经典可变星的垂直速度更适合约束扭曲的进动速率。基于空间结构参数，确定了银河系13千秒差距处的扭曲进动速率为ω = 4.9 ± 1.6 km s−1 kpc−1，支持了扭曲模型中的低进动速率。未来更多关于经典可变星的运动学信息将有助于更好地约束银河系的结构和演化。 <div>
Classical Cepheids (CCs) are excellent tracers for understanding the structure of the Milky Way disk. The latest Gaia Data Release 3 provides a large number of line-of-sight velocity information for Galactic CCs, offering an opportunity for studying the kinematics of the Milky Way. We determine the 3D velocities of 2057 CCs relative to the Galactic center. From the projections of the 3D velocities onto the X–Y plane of the Galactic disk, we find that the VR and Vϕ velocities of the northern and southern warps (directions with highest amplitude) are different. This phenomenon may be related to warp precession or asymmetry in warp structure. By investigating the kinematic warp model, we find that the vertical velocities of CCs are more suitable for constraining the warp precession rate than the line-of-node angle. Our results suggest that CCs at 12–14 kpc are the best sample for determining the Galactic warp precession rate. Based on the spatial structure parameters of Cepheid warp from Chen et al., we determine a warp precession rate of ω = 4.9 ± 1.6 km s−1 kpc−1 at 13 kpc, which supports a low precession rate in the warp model. In the future, more kinematic information on CCs will help to constrain the structure and evolution of the Milky Way better.

Using Gaia DR3 data, we revisit 56 high Galactic latitude (∣b∣ ≥ 30°) open cluster (OC) candidates with poor shapes of color–magnitude diagrams (CMDs), including unclear and paired main sequences (MSs). We aim to confirm their physical reality and explore whether the special MS morphology is intrinsic to genuine OCs. Initially, we redetermine cluster memberships by integrating five outlier detection algorithms into pyUPMASK. However, this work fails to reproduce the 56 clusters. Instead, we find an alternative set of 56 clusters, six of which are non-duplicates. To ascertain whether the six clusters are real OCs, we build synthetic CMDs to derive reliable cluster properties, including fundamental parameters, binary fraction, and mass of the cluster. Subsequently, we investigate the structural parameters and the age–mass and mass–radius relations of the six candidate OCs. Finally, we utilize a multidimensional approach, incorporating cluster properties, spatial structure, kinematic attributes, and CMD verification, to assess their physical reality as genuine OCs further. Our results suggest that the six candidates should be physical OCs, exhibiting well-defined CMD characteristics. Moreover, we discover two of the six OCs as potential binary clusters.

<div> 关键词: SGR J1935+2154, 磁星, 光谱分析, 爆发, X射线

总结:<br /><br />SGR J1935+2154是迄今为止最多产的磁星之一，其爆发活跃，且发出了第一个与X射线爆发相关联的银河快速射电爆发。研究采用了新颖的时间分辨光谱分析技术，成功探测了磁星爆发的真实光谱演化。研究结果对其他磁星的平均爆发特性进行了比较分析，具有重要的科学意义。 <div>
SGR J1935+2154 has truly been the most prolific magnetar over the last decade: it has been entering into burst active episodes once every 1–2 yr since its discovery in 2014, it emitted the first Galactic fast radio burst associated with an X-ray burst in 2020, and it has emitted hundreds of energetic short bursts. Here, we present the time-resolved spectral analysis of 51 bright bursts from SGR J1935+2154. Unlike conventional time-resolved X-ray spectroscopic studies in the literature, we follow a two-step approach to probe true spectral evolution. For each burst, we first extract spectral information from overlapping time segments, fit them with three continuum models, and employ a machine-learning-based clustering algorithm to identify time segments that provide the largest spectral variations during each burst. We then extract spectra from those nonoverlapping (clustered) time segments and fit them again with the three models: the cutoff power-law model, the sum of two blackbody functions, and the model considering the emission of a modified blackbody undergoing resonant cyclotron scattering, which is applied systematically at this scale for the first time. Our novel technique allowed us to establish the genuine spectral evolution of magnetar bursts. We discuss the implications of our results and compare their collective behavior with the average burst properties of other magnetars.

<div> 关键词: MMS mission, ion acceleration, turbulent magnetic reconnection, energetic ions, particle acceleration

总结:<br />
MMS任务通过测量电磁场，构建了一个湍流磁重连区域的试验粒子模拟，以研究观测到的离子加速现象。研究发现三种能量化的离子类型：离子喷流、Speiser样式的能量化离子以及由湍流场加速至较高能量的离子。大多数被湍流场能量化的离子会多次穿过磁场的零点平面。这些发现表明湍流在加速粒子中起到重要作用，并且最高加速能量受湍流区域的大小限制。由于湍流在宇宙等离子体中普遍存在且在尺度上没有限制，MMS的观测结果暗示湍流可能在粒子加速中起到重要作用。 <div>
Using electric and magnetic fields measured by the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission, we construct a test-particle simulation of a turbulent magnetic reconnection region to investigate observed ion acceleration. We identify three types of energized ions: (1) ion jets, (2) Speiser-like energized ions—both of which carry significant energy but do not produce a strong energetic (>80 keV) tail in the ion distribution—and (3) a separate but sizable population of ions that are accelerated to significantly higher energies (>80 keV) by the turbulent fields. The majority of ions that undergo energization by the turbulent fields cross the magnetic null plane multiple times. By preferentially energizing these particles, the turbulence creates a separate population of ions that mostly exits in the dawn direction of the magnetotail and forms a high-energy power-law tail in the ion flux-energy distribution. We also find that the highest acceleration energies are limited by the size of the turbulent region (with respect to ion gyroradii). Since turbulence is widespread in astrophysical plasmas and has no a priori limit on scale size, the MMS observations suggest turbulence may have a significant role in particle acceleration.

这篇文章报告了对Sombrero星系（M104，NGC 4594）中亚秒尺度喷流的多频和多时期长基线干涉观测研究。利用12、22、44和88 GHz的非常长基线阵列数据，研究了喷流的运动学和紧凑核心的性质。研究发现，在12和22 GHz下可以清晰地检测到亚秒尺度喷流，并且在44 GHz下可以解析内部喷流基地至约70个Schwarzschild半径（Rs）。喷流的视运动测量速度分别为0.20 ± 0.08c和0.05 ± 0.02c。核心的测量亮度温度接近于均衡亮度温度，表明辐射粒子的能量密度与亚秒尺度喷流区域的磁场能量密度相当。88 GHz处测得的核心尺寸（约25 ± 5 Rs）偏离了在较低频率下看到的预期频率依赖。这可能表明毫米波辐射的不同来源，可以通过对流支配的吸积流动（ADAF）模型来解释，该模型进一步预测在230和340 GHz处，ADAF可能主导射电发射而不是喷流。<br /><br />总结: 本研究发现在Sombrero星系中存在亚秒尺度的喷流，并测得了其运动学特性和核心性质。测量结果表明喷流的视运动速度和核心亮度温度符合已有理论预期，但在频率为88 GHz处的核心尺寸偏离了预期。这暗示了毫米波辐射可能来自不同的来源，并且可以通过ADAF模型来解释这一现象。 <div>
We report multifrequency and multiepoch very long baseline interferometry studies of the subparsec jet in the Sombrero galaxy (M104, NGC 4594). Using Very Long Baseline Array data at 12, 22, 44, and 88 GHz, we study the kinematics of the jet and the properties of the compact core. The subparsec jet is clearly detected at 12 and 22 GHz, and the inner jet base is resolved down to ∼70 Schwarzschild radii (Rs) at 44 GHz. The proper motions of the jet are measured with apparent subrelativistic speeds of 0.20 ± 0.08c and 0.05 ± 0.02c for the approaching and the receding jet, respectively. Based on the apparent speed and jet-to-counterjet brightness ratio, we estimate the jet viewing angle to be larger than ∼37°, and the intrinsic speed to be between ∼0.10c and 0.40c. Their joint probability distribution suggests the most probable values of the viewing angle and intrinsic speed to be and 0.19 ± 0.04c, respectively. We also find that the measured brightness temperatures of the core at 12, 22, and 44 GHz are close to the equipartition brightness temperature, indicating that the energy density of the radiating particles is comparable to the energy density of the magnetic field in the subparsec jet region. Interestingly, the measured core size at 88 GHz (∼25 ± 5 Rs) deviates from the expected frequency dependence seen at lower frequencies. This may indicate a different origin for the millimeter emission, which can be explained by an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model. This model further predicts that at 230 and 340 GHz, the ADAF may dominate the radio emission over the jet.

<div> ΛCDM, general relativity, Hubble tension, alternative cosmological models, gravitational potential<br />
总结: 这篇文章提出了一种基于常规广义相对论的宇宙学模型，可以解决哈勃张力的问题。重新分析ΛCDM模型的基础，表明广义相对论本身并没有明确规定质量密度的哪一部分作为弗里德曼方程的源项，以及哪一部分作为浓缩物体的引力势源。这为常规广义相对论内的另类宇宙模型打开了途径，并证明ΛCDM模型并非是通常引力源下爱因斯坦方程的唯一解。文章强调了ΛCDM模型中引力势源的来源是质量密度偏差，而不是像牛顿理论中一样的浓缩质量总密度。ΛCDM-NG模型利用了引力势源的自由度，将物质在两个源项之间移动，将引力势的源复原为牛顿形式。在ΛCDM-NG模型中不存在哈勃张力，如果浓缩物体的引力势在某个范围内，而这个范围对于实际宇宙来说并不是不合理的。ΛCDM-NG模型中的减速参数与ΛCDM模型不同，这提示了两个模型之间的区别的一个测试方法。 <div>
We offer a cosmological model based on conventional general relativity (no speculative physics) that may resolve the Hubble tension. A reanalysis of the foundation of the Lambda-CDM model shows that general relativity alone does not specify what fraction of the mass density acts as the source term in Friedmann’s equation and what fraction acts as the source of the gravitational potential of condensed objects. This observation opens the way to alternative cosmological models within conventional general relativity, and it proves that the ΛCDM model is not the unique solution of Einstein’s equations for the usual cosmological sources of gravitation. We emphasize that the source of the gravitation potential in the ΛCDM model is the deviation δρm of the mass density away from its average value, and not the total density of condensed masses as in Newtonian theory. Though not often stated, this is a modification of Newtonian gravitation within the ΛCDM model. The ΛCDM-NG model uses the freedom to move matter between source terms to restore the source of gravitational potential to its Newtonian form. There is no Hubble tension in the ΛCDM-NG model if the gravitational potential of condensed objects (stars, galaxies, and dark matter clouds) falls in a certain range, a range that does not seem unreasonable for the actual Universe. The deceleration parameter in the ΛCDM-NG model differs from that in the ΛCDM model, suggesting a test to distinguish between the two models.

<div> 关键词: MeV pulsars, X-ray emission, efficiency, pair multiplicity, viewing angle

总结: 
MeV pulsars的X射线发射具有较高的辐射效率和硬谱，与Fermi-LAT脉冲星相比。估计其辐射效率在keV-MeV能带上在0.01-0.1之间，需要的对数增倍数为10^4-10^7。这表明MeV脉冲星的X射线/软伽马射线发射可能由GeV光子产生的次级对产生。其差异可能与观测角度或者磁轴倾斜角度有关。 <div>
We report on the properties of pulsed X-ray emission from eight MeV pulsars using XMM-Newton, NICER, NuSTAR, and HXMT data. For five of the eight MeV pulsars, the X-ray spectra can be fit by a broken power-law model with a break energy of ∼5–10 keV. The photon indices below and above the break energy are ∼1 and ∼1.5, respectively. In comparison with the X-ray emission of the Fermi-LAT pulsars, the MeV pulsars have a harder spectrum and a higher radiation efficiency in the 0.3–10 keV energy bands. When isotropic emission is assumed, the emission efficiency in the keV–MeV bands is estimated to be ηMeV ∼ 0.01–0.1, and this is similar to the efficiency of the GeV emission of the Fermi-LAT pulsars with a similar spin-down power. To explain the observed efficiency of the MeV pulsars, we estimate the required pair multiplicity as 104–7, which depends on the emission process (curvature radiation or synchrotron radiation) and on the location in the magnetosphere. The high multiplicity indicates that the secondary pairs that are created by a pair-creation process of the GeV photons produce the X-ray/soft gamma-ray emission of the MeV pulsars. We speculate that the difference between MeV pulsars and Fermi-LAT pulsars can be attributed to the difference in viewing angle measured from the spin axis if the emission originates from a region inside the light cylinder (canonical gap model) or to the difference in the inclination angle of the magnetic axis if the emission is produced in the equatorial current sheet outside the light cylinder.

We present a method to quantify the convergence rate of the fast estimators of the covariance matrices in the large-scale structure analysis. Our method is based on the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence, which describes the relative entropy of two probability distributions. As a case study, we analyze the delete-d jackknife estimator for the covariance matrix of the galaxy correlation function. We introduce the information factor or the normalized KL divergence with the help of a set of baseline covariance matrices to diagnose the information contained in the jackknife covariance matrix. Using a set of quick particle mesh mock catalogs designed for the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey DR11 CMASS galaxy survey, we find that the jackknife resampling method succeeds in recovering the covariance matrix with 10 times fewer simulation mocks than that of the baseline method at small scales (s ≤ 40 h−1 Mpc). However, the ability to reduce the number of mock catalogs is degraded at larger scales due to the increasing bias on the jackknife covariance matrix. Note that the analysis in this paper can be applied to any fast estimator of the covariance matrix for galaxy clustering measurements.

<div> SMDS, RST, JWST, dark matter, redshift<br />总结:<br />在早期宇宙形成的超大质量暗物质星体(SMDS)通过Roman Space Telescope (RST)能够被识别，可以使用拉曼散射望远镜辨别SMDS和早期星系，而James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)的光谱技术能够辨别SMDS的吸收线，结合两者的使用可以更好地研究SMDS，并推测这种新型星体可能由暗物质提供能量，或许可以解开观测到的z>6明亮类星体的超大质量黑洞的起源之谜。 <div>
Supermassive dark stars (SMDS) are luminous stellar objects formed in the early Universe at redshift z ∼ 10–20, made primarily of hydrogen and helium, yet powered by dark matter. We examine the capabilities of the Roman Space Telescope (RST), and find it able to identify ∼106M⊙ SMDSs at redshifts up to z ≃ 14. With a gravitational lensing factor of μ ∼ 100, RST could identify SMDS as small as ∼104M⊙ at z ∼ 12 with ∼106 s exposure. Differentiating SMDSs from early galaxies containing zero metallicity stars at similar redshifts requires spectral, photometric, and morphological comparisons. With only RST, the differentiation of SMDS, particularly those formed via adiabatic contraction with M ≳ 105M⊙ and lensed by μ ≳ 100, is possible due to their distinct photometric signatures from the first galaxies. Those formed via dark matter capture can be differentiated only by image morphology: i.e., point object (SMDSs) versus extended object (sufficiently magnified galaxies). By additionally employing James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) spectroscopy, we can identify the He iiλ1640 absorption line, a smoking gun for SMDS detection. Although RST does not cover the required wavelength band (for zemi ≳ 10), JWST does; hence, the two can be used in tandem to identify SMDS. The detection of SMDS would confirm a new type of star powered by dark matter and may shed light on the origins of the supermassive black holes powering bright quasars observed at z ≳ 6.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章主要使用了大量的红巨星光谱数据，创建了恒星参数的二阶多项式模型，以研究恒星光谱中非恒星信息，如扩散星际带。研究发现，许多光谱残留特征可以归因于来自地球大气和星际介质的扩散星际带的残留。在去除大部分地球大气残留后，确定了84个吸收特征，其中25个是扩散星际带，并且可以为银河星际介质科学和正在进行的Sloan Digital Sky Survey V的银河调查项目提供重要帮助。 <div>
Data-driven models of stellar spectra are useful tools to study nonstellar information, such as the diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) caused by intervening interstellar material. Using ∼55,000 spectra of ∼17,000 red clump stars from the APOGEE DR16 data set, we create second-order polynomial models of the continuum-normalized flux as a function of stellar parameters (Teff, , [Fe/H], [α/Fe], and age). The model and data show good agreement within uncertainties across the APOGEE wavelength range, although many regions reveal residuals that are not in the stellar rest-frame. We show that many of these residual features—having average extrema at the level of ∼3% in stellar flux on average—can be attributed to incompletely removed spectral lines from the Earth’s atmosphere and DIBs from the interstellar medium (ISM). After removing most of the remaining contamination from Earth’s sky, we identify 84 absorption features not seen in unreddened sightlights that have <50% probability of being noise artifacts—with 25 of these features having <5% probability of being noise artifacts—including all 10 previously known DIBs in the APOGEE wavelength range. Because many of these features occur in the wavelength windows that APOGEE uses to measure chemical abundances, note that characterization and removal of this nonstellar contamination establish an important step in reaching the precision required for chemical tagging experiments. Proper characterization of these features will benefit Galactic ISM science and the currently ongoing Milky Way Mapper program of Sloan Digital Sky Survey V, which relies on the APOGEE spectrograph.

<br />
银河系内恒星的化学丰度分析显示，银河系中心附近的恒星以低铌/镁比例为特征，表明核聚变超新星的产出对这一地区的化学丰度有重要影响。与铌相比，铈的变化更为复杂。对于低镁/铁比例和高镁/铁比例的恒星群体，铌和铈的丰度分布各不相同。总体来说，随着金属丰度的降低，铌和铈的丰度均会增加。最金属贫的恒星显示出早期银河系化学富集的特征，这可能主要受核心坍缩超新星和r过程天体物理地点（如磁旋超新星）的影响。空间化学分布显示，铌和铈的丰度在银河系内呈现出明显的地域性差异，不同的镁/铁比例的恒星群体在丰度分布上也有所不同。

This study probes the chemical abundances of the neutron-capture elements cerium and neodymium in the inner Milky Way from an analysis of a sample of ∼2000 stars in the Galactic bulge bar spatially contained within ∣XGal∣ < 5 kpc, ∣YGal∣ < 3.5 kpc, and ∣ZGal∣ < 1 kpc, and spanning metallicities between −2.0 ≲ [Fe/H] ≲ +0.5. We classify the sample stars into low- or high-[Mg/Fe] populations and find that, in general, values of [Ce/Fe] and [Nd/Fe] increase as the metallicity decreases for the low- and high-[Mg/Fe] populations. Ce abundances show a more complex variation across the metallicity range of our bulge-bar sample when compared to Nd, with the r-process dominating the production of neutron-capture elements in the high-[Mg/Fe] population ([Ce/Nd] < 0.0). We find a spatial chemical dependence of Ce and Nd abundances for our sample of bulge-bar stars, with low- and high-[Mg/Fe] populations displaying a distinct abundance distribution. In the region close to the center of the MW, the low-[Mg/Fe] population is dominated by stars with low [Ce/Fe], [Ce/Mg], [Nd/Mg], [Nd/Fe], and [Ce/Nd] ratios. The low [Ce/Nd] ratio indicates a significant contribution in this central region from r-process yields for the low-[Mg/Fe] population. The chemical pattern of the most metal-poor stars in our sample suggests an early chemical enrichment of the bulge dominated by yields from core-collapse supernovae and r-process astrophysical sites, such as magnetorotational supernovae.

<div> 快速射电爆发，FRB，重复器，非重复器，磁层模型
总结：<br /><br />本文提出了一个统一的几何模型，用于区分重复器和非重复器的快速射电爆发。在这个模型中，考虑了中子星磁层内的准切向传播效应。观测到的偏振特性是验证这一统一几何模型的重要线索，因为偏振对准切向传播效应敏感。此外，我们的模型有效解释了频带宽度，持续时间，峰值亮度，能量，亮度温度，时间-频率向下漂移和重复率等其他区分特性，为支持快速射电爆发的磁层起源提供了令人信服的证据。 <div>
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration extragalactic radio transients. They fall into the categories of repeaters and apparent nonrepeaters. However, such a classification causes a lack of motivation to investigate the physical picture. Here, we propose a unified geometric model to distinguish between repeaters and apparent nonrepeaters, in which the quasi-tangential (QT) propagation effect within the magnetosphere of a neutron star is considered. In this model, apparent nonrepeaters arise from sources whose emitting region has a smaller impact angle with respect to the magnetic axis, while repeaters come from sources whose emitting region has a larger impact angle. The observational discriminant polarization properties between repeaters and apparent nonrepeaters are an important clue for verifying this unified geometric model since the polarization is sensitive to the QT propagation effect. Moreover, our model effectively explains all of the other discriminant properties, including bandwidth, duration, peak luminosity, energy, brightness temperature, time–frequency downward drifting, and repetition rate, providing compelling evidence for the magnetospheric origin of FRBs.

JUNO将充分利用三种不同的方式——带电流相互作用（CC）、中性流相互作用（NC）和弹性散射（ES）来检测8B太阳中微子的物理潜力，从而实现模型无关的观测。利用液体闪烁体探测器中13C核的最大受电质量和预期的低背景水平，首次可以观测到13C上8B太阳中微子的CC和NC相互作用。借助优化的事件选择和μ子否决策略，可以大大抑制偶然符合、μ子诱导同位素和外部背景引起的背景。在CC、NC和ES通道中可以实现优异的信号与背景比，从而保证观测8B太阳中微子。通过本研究的敏感性研究，我们证明JUNO在10年数据采集后，可以实现8B太阳中微子流的1σ精度水平分别为5%、8%和20%。对太阳物理和中微子物理的详细研究将是独特而有用的。此外，结合Sudbury中微子天文台的测量结果，我们预计可以获得8B太阳中微子流的世界最佳精度水平为3%。 <br /><br />总结: JUNO将利用CC、NC和ES相互作用检测8B太阳中微子的物理潜力，实现模型无关的观测。利用13C核的最大受电质量和优化的事件选择和μ子否决策略，可以实现优异的信号与背景比，从而保证观测8B太阳中微子。通过敏感性研究，证明JUNO在10年数据采集后能够实现8B太阳中微子的高精度观测。 <div>
The physics potential of detecting 8B solar neutrinos will be exploited at the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), in a model-independent manner by using three distinct channels of the charged current (CC), neutral current (NC), and elastic scattering (ES) interactions. Due to the largest-ever mass of 13C nuclei in the liquid scintillator detectors and the expected low background level, 8B solar neutrinos are observable in the CC and NC interactions on 13C for the first time. By virtue of optimized event selections and muon veto strategies, backgrounds from the accidental coincidence, muon-induced isotopes, and external backgrounds can be greatly suppressed. Excellent signal-to-background ratios can be achieved in the CC, NC, and ES channels to guarantee the observation of the 8B solar neutrinos. From the sensitivity studies performed in this work, we show that JUNO, with 10 yr of data, can reach the 1σ precision levels of 5%, 8%, and 20% for the 8B neutrino flux, , and , respectively. Probing the details of both solar physics and neutrino physics would be unique and helpful. In addition, when combined with the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory measurement, the world's best precision of 3% is expected for the measurement of the 8B neutrino flux.

We analyze a sample of 244 ram-pressure-stripped candidate galaxy members within the virial radius of 62 nearby clusters to determine their velocity anisotropy profile β(r). We use previously determined mass profiles for the 62 clusters to build an ensemble cluster by stacking the 62 cluster samples in projected phase space. We solve the Jeans equation for dynamical equilibrium by two methods, MAMPOSSt and the Jeans inversion technique, and determine β(r) both in parametric form and nonparametrically. The two methods consistently indicate that the orbits of the ram-pressure-stripped candidates are increasingly radial with distance from the cluster center, from almost isotropic (β ≃ 0) at the center, to very radial at the virial radius (β ≃ 0.7). The orbits of cluster galaxies undergoing ram pressure stripping are similar to those of spiral cluster galaxies but more radially elongated at large radii.

We explore the cosmological implications of the local limit of nonlocal gravity, which is a classical generalization of Einstein’s theory of gravitation within the framework of teleparallelism. An appropriate solution of this theory is the modified Cartesian flat cosmological model. The main purpose of this paper is to study linear perturbations about the orthonormal tetrad frame field adapted to the standard comoving observers in this model. The observational viability of the perturbed model is examined using all available data regarding the cosmic microwave background. The implications of the linearly perturbed modified Cartesian flat model are examined and it is shown that the model is capable of alleviating the H0 tension.

The calculation of internal atmospheric (longwave) fluxes is a key component of any model of exoplanet atmospheres that requires radiative-transfer (RT) calculations. For atmospheres containing a strong scattering component such as cloud particles, most 1D multiple-scattering RT methods typically involve numerically expensive matrix inversions. This computational bottleneck is exacerbated when multitudes of RT calculations are required, such as in general circulation models (GCMs) and retrieval methods. In an effort to increase the speed of RT calculations without sacrificing too much accuracy, we investigate the applicability of approximate longwave scattering methods developed for the Earth science community to hot Jupiter atmospheres. We test the absorption approximation and variational iteration method (VIM) applied to typical cloudy hot Jupiter scenarios, using 64-stream DISORT calculations as reference solutions. We find the four-stream VIM variant is a highly promising method to explore for use in hot Jupiter GCM and retrieval modeling, and it shows excellent speed characteristics, with typical errors ∼1% for outgoing fluxes and within ∼50%, but with larger errors in the test case of a deep cloud layer, for vertical heating rates. Other methods explored in this study were found to typically produce similar error characteristics in vertical heating rates.

总结:<br /><br />研究使用地球CIR检测来预测火星上的CIR观测，通过Parker螺旋模型计算到达时间，利用Wind数据推导现场参数，预测结果与实际观测值吻合良好，为未来天问一号观测提供了有益参考。 <div>
Using the Stream Interaction Regions list from the Tianwen-1/Mars Orbiter Magnetometer (MOMAG) data between 2021 November and 2021 December and from Wind observations, we present an accurate prediction for the arrival time and in situ parameters of corotating interaction regions (CIRs) when the Earth and Mars have large longitudinal separations. Since CIRs were detected earlier at Earth than at Mars during the period examined, we employ Earth-based CIR detections for predicting CIR observations at Mars. The arrival time is calculated by the Parker spiral model under the assumption of steady corotation of the Sun and coronal holes, while the in situ parameters are derived from Wind data through radial dependent scaling laws. The CIR prediction results are compared to the actual observations obtained from the MOMAG and Mars Ion and Neutral Particle Analyzer instruments onboard Tianwen-1, as well as the Magnetometer and Solar Wind Ion Analyzer instruments onboard MAVEN. The predicted arrival time is close to the observed values with relative errors less than 10%, and the expected in situ data show a good consistency with the Martian measurements. The comparison results indicate that the prediction method has good performance and will be helpful for comparative analysis with Tianwen-1 observations at Mars in the future.

In the current era of high-z galaxy discovery with JWST and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, our ability to study the stellar populations and interstellar medium conditions in a diverse range of galaxies at Cosmic Dawn has rapidly improved. At the same time, the need to understand the current limitations in modeling galaxy formation processes and physical properties in order to interpret these observations is critical. Here, we study the challenges in modeling galaxy dust temperatures, both in the context of forward modeling galaxy spectral properties from a hydrodynamical simulation and via backwards modeling galaxy physical properties from mock observations of far-infrared dust emission. Using the simba model for galaxy formation combined with powderday radiative transfer, we can accurately predict the evolution of dust at high redshift, though several aspects of the model are essentially free parameters (dust composition, subresolution dust in star-forming regions) that dull the predictive power of the model dust temperature distributions. We also highlight the uncertainties in the backwards modeling methods, where we find the commonly used models and assumptions to fit far-infrared spectral energy distributions and infer dust temperatures (e.g., single temperature, optically thin modified blackbody) largely fail to capture the complexity of high-z dusty galaxies. We caution that conclusions inferred from both simulations—limited by resolution and post-processing techniques—and observations—limited by sparse data and simplistic model parameterizations—are susceptible to unique and nuanced uncertainties that can limit the usefulness of current high-z dust measurements.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Supernova blast wave shock is a very important site of cosmic-ray acceleration. However, the detailed physical process of acceleration, in particular, nonlinear interplay between cosmic-ray streaming and magnetic field amplification, has not been studied under a realistic environment. In this paper, using a unique and novel numerical method, we study cosmic-ray acceleration at supernova blast wave shock propagating in the interstellar medium with well-resolved magnetic field amplification by nonresonant hybrid instability (or Bell instability). We find that the magnetic field is mildly amplified under typical interstellar medium conditions that leads to maximum cosmic-ray energy ≃30 TeV for supernova remnants with age ≃1000 yr consistent with gamma-ray observations. The strength of the amplified magnetic field does not reach the so-called saturation level because the cosmic-ray electric current toward the shock upstream has a finite spatial extent, by which Bell instability cannot experience many e-folding times.

Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can power relativistic jets, which are called blazars when pointed close to our line of sight. Depending on the presence or absence of emission lines in their optical spectra, blazars are categorized into flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) or BL Lacertae (BL Lac) objects. According to the “blazar sequence,” as synchrotron peak frequency ( ) shifts to higher energies, the synchrotron peak luminosity decreases. This means that BL Lac objects as luminous as FSRQs, and with synchrotron peak frequencies Hz, should not exist. Detected as a high-synchrotron peak (HSP; Hz) BL Lac object, 4FGL J1520.8-0348 shows high γ-ray luminosity (Lγ > 1046 erg s−1), being at a high redshift of z = 1.46. Since it is an outlier in the “blazar sequence,” the process of its jet acceleration and power may be different from bona fide BL Lac objects. In this work, we constrain its spectral energy distribution (SED) by modeling the multiwavelength data from infrared to γ-ray regime. Simultaneous X-ray data were obtained from X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission and Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array to constrain the synchrotron emission and underlying electron distribution. On undertaking the SED modeling of the source, including the effect of extragalactic background light, we conclude that the source is more likely to be a “blue FSRQ” or “masquerading BL Lac” where the BL Lac object is actually an FSRQ in disguise.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This paper investigates the distribution and implications of cosmic-ray electrons within the intergalactic medium (IGM). Utilizing a synthesis model of the extragalactic background, we evolve the spectrum of Compton-included cosmic rays. The energy density distribution of cosmic-ray electrons peaks at redshift z ≈ 2, and peaks in the ∼MeV range. The fractional contribution of cosmic-ray pressure to the general IGM pressure progressively increases toward lower redshift. At mean density, the ratio of cosmic-ray electron to thermal pressure in the IGM is 0.3% at z = 2, rising to 1.0% at z = 1, and 1.8% at z = 0.1 (considering only the cosmic rays produced locally by Compton scattering). We compute the linear Landau damping rate of plasma oscillations in the IGM caused by the ∼MeV cosmic-ray electrons, and find it to be of order ∼10−6 s−1 for wavenumbers 1.2 ≲ ck/ωp ≲ 5 at z = 2 and mean density (where ωp is the plasma frequency). This strongly affects the fate of TeV e+e− pair beams produced by blazars, which are potentially unstable to oblique instabilities involving plasma oscillations with wavenumber (θ being the angle between the beam and wavevector). Linear Landau damping is at least thousands of times faster than either pair beam instability growth or collisional effects; it thus turns off the pair beam instability except for modes with very small θ (ck/ωp → 1, where linear Landau damping is kinematically suppressed). This leaves open the question of whether the pair beam instability is turned off entirely, or can still proceed via the small-θ modes.

Current imaging observations of protoplanetary disks using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) primarily focus on the submillimeter wavelength, leaving a gap in effective observational approaches for centimeter-sized dust, which is crucial to the issue of planet formation. The forthcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and ngVLA may rectify this deficiency. In this paper, we employ multifluid hydrodynamic numerical simulations and radiative transfer calculations to investigate the potential of SKA1-Mid, ngVLA, and SKA2 for imaging protoplanetary disks at subcentimeter/centimeter wavelengths. We create mock images with ALMA/SKA/ngVLA at multiwavelengths based on the hydrodynamical simulation output and test different sensitivity and spatial resolutions. We discover that both SKA and ngVLA will serve as excellent supplements to the existing observational range of ALMA, and their high resolution enables them to image substructures in the disk’s inner region (∼5 au from the stellar). Our results indicate that SKA and ngVLA can be utilized for more extended monitoring programs in the centimeter wave band. While in the subcentimeter range, ngVLA possesses the capability to produce high-fidelity images within shorter observation times (∼1 hr on source time) than previous research, holding potential for future survey observations. We also discuss for the first time the potential of SKA2 for observing protoplanetary disks at a 0.7 cm wavelength.

<title>Persistent Upflows and Downflows at Active Region Boundaries Observed by SUTRI and AIA</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Upflows and downflows at active region (AR) boundaries have been frequently observed with spectroscopic observations at extreme ultraviolet passbands. In this paper, we report the coexistence of upflows and downflows at the AR boundaries with imaging observations from the Solar Upper Transition Region Imager (SUTRI) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). With their observations from 2022 September 21 to 2022 September 30, we find 17 persistent opposite flows occurring along the AR coronal loops. The upflows are prominent in the AIA 193 Å images with a velocity of 50–200 km s−1, while the downflows are best seen in the SUTRI 465 Å and AIA 131 Å images with a slower velocity of tens of kilometers per second (characteristic temperatures (log T(K)) for 193, 465, and 131 Å are 6.2, 5.7, and 5.6, respectively). We also analyze the center-to-limb variation of the velocities for both upflows and downflows. The simultaneous observations of downflows and upflows can be explained by the chromosphere–corona mass-cycling process, in which the localized chromospheric plasma is impulsively heated to coronal temperature forming a upflow and then these upflows experience radiative cooling producing a downflow with the previously heated plasma returning to the lower atmosphere. In particular, the persistent downflows seen by SUTRI provide strong evidence of the cooling process in the mass cycle. For upflows associated with open loops, part of the plasma is able to escape outward and into the heliosphere as solar wind.

ALMA望远镜的ALCS调查发现了180个红移在0.5到6之间的亚毫米星系，大多数位于富含尘埃的星系中。这些星系中大部分遵循星形成的主序列，少部分显示强烈的星暴活动。还发现了包括两个极度尘埃遮挡的星系在内的高红外过量源，以及六个隐匿的活跃星系核候选体。此外，研究还揭示了ALCS样本涵盖了较传统的同一红移范围内亚毫米星系样本更广泛的尘埃质量范围。总结: ALMA望远镜的ALCS调查发现了180个红移在0.5到6之间的亚毫米星系，大多数位于富含尘埃的星系中，遵循星形成的主序列，还发现了高红外过量源和隐匿的活跃星系核候选体。 <div>
Sub/millimeter galaxies are a key population for the study of galaxy evolution because the majority of star formation at high redshifts occurred in galaxies deeply embedded in dust. To search for this population, we have performed an extensive survey with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), called the ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey (ALCS). This survey covers 133 arcmin2 area and securely detects 180 sources at z ∼ 0.5–6 with a flux limit of ∼0.2 mJy at 1.2 mm. Here, we report the results of multiwavelength spectral energy distribution analysis of the whole ALCS sample, utilizing the observed-frame UV to millimeter photometry. We find that the majority of the ALCS sources lie on the star-forming main sequence, with a smaller fraction showing intense starburst activities. The ALCS sample contains high infrared-excess sources ( ), including two extremely dust-obscured galaxies (IRX > 5). We also confirm that the ALCS sample probes a broader range in lower dust mass than conventional submillimeter galaxy samples in the same redshift range. We identify six heavily obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates that are not detected in the archival Chandra data in addition to the three X-ray AGNs reported by Uematsu et al. (2023). The inferred AGN luminosity density shows a possible excess at z = 2–3 compared with that determined from X-ray surveys below 10 keV.

太阳射电U爆发是由沿着太阳冕区闭合磁环的电子束产生的。本研究利用了2020年6月5日观测到的一个具有显著下行分量的U爆发的LOFAR干涉太阳成像数据。通过分析无线电源的质心位置，我们确定了一个大型日冕磁环的束流速度和物理参数，其高度约为1.3 R⊙。在这个高度上，我们发现等离子体温度约为1.1 MK，等离子体压力约为0.20 mdyn，cm-2，最小磁场强度约为0.07 G。从图像中确定的物理性质的相似性表明了一个对称的环。在上升段的平均电子束速度为0.21c，而在下降段为0.14c。这种明显的减速归因于与Langmuir波共振的电子能量范围的减少，可能是由于下行环腿上的正背景等离子体密度梯度的减小。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究利用LOFAR干涉太阳成像数据对具有显著下行分量的U爆发进行了分析。研究确定了大型日冕磁环的束流速度和物理参数，发现了对称的环。此外，研究还发现在下降段出现了明显的减速现象，这可能是由于下行环腿上的正背景等离子体密度梯度的减小引起的。 <div>
Solar radio U-bursts are generated by electron beams traveling along closed magnetic loops in the solar corona. Low-frequency (<100 MHz) U-bursts serve as powerful diagnostic tools for studying large-sized coronal loops that extend into the middle corona. However, the positive frequency drift component (descending leg) of U-bursts has received less attention in previous studies, as the descending radio flux is weak. In this study, we utilized LOFAR interferometric solar imaging data from a U-burst that has a significant descending leg component, observed between 10 and 90 MHz on 2020 June 5th. By analyzing the radio source centroid positions, we determined the beam velocities and physical parameters of a large coronal magnetic loop that reached just about 1.3 R⊙ in altitude. At this altitude, we found the plasma temperature to be around 1.1 MK, the plasma pressure around 0.20 mdyn, cm−2, and the minimum magnetic field strength around 0.07 G. The similarity in physical properties determined from the image suggests a symmetric loop. The average electron beam velocity on the ascending leg was found to be 0.21c, while it was 0.14c on the descending leg. This apparent deceleration is attributed to a decrease in the range of electron energies that resonate with Langmuir waves, likely due to the positive background plasma density gradient along the downward loop leg.

这篇文章是关于红超巨星（RSGs）的下质量限的研究。通过对6602个星体进行分析，使用了五种不同的方法来区分不同的恒星族群。其中机器学习和χ2方法提供了最佳和相对一致的预测。研究得出RSG族群的下限能够达到红巨星分支的Ks带顶部，表明其亮度低至约103.5倍太阳亮度，对应于约100个太阳半径的恒星半径。根据质量-亮度关系，考虑到失去质量的微弱RSGs，RSG族群的最小初始质量约为6.1±0.4太阳质量。这是第一次光谱证据表明RSG族群的下质量限约为6太阳质量。然而，这些微弱RSGs的命运仍然难以捉摸，并可能对恒星演化和超新星模型产生重大影响。
<br /><br />总结: RSGs的下质量限研究，使用了多种分析方法，确定了RSG族群的下限，并得出了其最小初始质量，为6.1±0.4太阳质量。这为恒星演化和超新星模型提供了重要线索。 <div>
The precise definition of the lower mass limit of red supergiant stars (RSGs) is an open question in astrophysics and does not attract much attention. Here, we assemble a spectroscopic evolved cool star sample with 6602 targets, including RSGs, asymptotic giant branch stars, and red giant branch stars, in the Large Magellanic Cloud based on Gaia DR3 and Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV/APOGEE-2. The reference spectrum of each stellar population is built according to the quantile range of relative intensity (1% ∼ 99%). Five different methods, e.g., χ2, cosine similarity, machine learning (ML), equivalent width, and line ratio, are used in order to separate different stellar populations. ML and χ2 provide the best and relatively consistent prediction of a certain population. The derived lower limit of the RSG population is able to reach the Ks-band tip of the red giant branch (Ks ≈12.0 mag), indicating a luminosity as low as about 103.5L⊙, which corresponds to a stellar radius of only about 100 R⊙. Given the mass–luminosity relation of with f ≈ 15.5 ± 3 and taking into account the mass loss of faint RSGs up to now, the minimal initial mass of the RSG population would be about 6.1 ± 0.4 M⊙, which is much lower than the traditional threshold of 8 M⊙ for the massive stars. This is the first spectroscopic evidence, indicating that the lower mass limit of the RSG population is around 6 M⊙. However, the destinies of such faint RSGs are still elusive and may have a large impact on stellar evolutionary and supernova models.

<div> AGN, SNe Ia, ISM, turbulence, multiphase condensation
总结: 该研究对大质量星系中介质的局部密度层化区域进行了高分辨率的流体动力学模拟。研究发现SNe Ia在介质中产生了主要是压缩性的湍流，触发了介质的多相凝结，形成了多种气体。当净冷却率低于净加热率时，SNe Ia产生的热风席卷了局部大部分物质。需要全局模拟来评估这些气体的最终命运。 <div>
Massive elliptical galaxies harbor large amounts of hot gas (T ≳ 106 K) in their interstellar medium (ISM) but are typically quiescent in star formation. The jets of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) inject energy into the ISM, which offsets its radiative losses and keeps it hot. SNe Ia deposit their energy locally within the galaxy compared to the larger few ×10 kiloparsec-scale AGN jets. In this study, we perform high-resolution (5123) hydrodynamic simulations of a local (1 kpc3) density-stratified patch of the ISM of massive galaxies. We include radiative cooling and shell-averaged volume heating, as well as randomly exploding SN Ia. We study the effect of different fractions of supernova (SN) heating (with respect to the net cooling rate), different initial ISM density/entropy (which controls the growth time tti of the thermal instability), and different degrees of stratification (which affect the freefall time tff). We find that SNe Ia drive predominantly compressive turbulence in the ISM with a velocity dispersion of σv up to 40 km s−1 and logarithmic density dispersion of σs ∼ 0.2–0.4. These fluctuations trigger multiphase condensation in regions of the ISM, where , in agreement with theoretical expectations that large density fluctuations efficiently trigger multiphase gas formation. Since the SN Ia rate is not self-adjusting, when the net cooling drops below the net heating rate, SNe Ia drive a hot wind which sweeps out most of the mass in our local model. Global simulations are required to assess the ultimate fate of this gas.

Quasars are bright and unobscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) thought to be powered by the accretion of matter around supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. The temporal variability of a quasar’s brightness contains valuable information about its physical properties. The UV/optical variability is thought to be a stochastic process, often represented as a damped random walk described by a stochastic differential equation (SDE). Upcoming wide-field telescopes such as the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) are expected to observe tens of millions of AGN in multiple filters over a ten year period, so there is a need for efficient and automated modeling techniques that can handle the large volume of data. Latent SDEs are machine learning models well suited for modeling quasar variability, as they can explicitly capture the underlying stochastic dynamics. In this work, we adapt latent SDEs to jointly reconstruct multivariate quasar light curves and infer their physical properties such as the black hole mass, inclination angle, and temperature slope. Our model is trained on realistic simulations of LSST ten year quasar light curves, and we demonstrate its ability to reconstruct quasar light curves even in the presence of long seasonal gaps and irregular sampling across different bands, outperforming a multioutput Gaussian process regression baseline. Our method has the potential to provide a deeper understanding of the physical properties of quasars and is applicable to a wide range of other multivariate time series with missing data and irregular sampling.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章利用JWST NIRSpec的新光谱数据研究了NGC 7469这个近距离的活跃星系，重点关注了活跃星系核（AGN）在周核区气体的激发和动力学作用。研究发现AGN的光电离作用占据着星系中心300 pc范围内的主要地位，同时还发现了少许区域的冲击激发迹象，可能与紧凑的射电喷流有关。此外，气体的速度场和速度离散度图显示了复杂的气体运动学特征，旋转是主要的特征，但还发现了与气体流入方向一致的非圆形运动。研究还发现了气体的流入速率远超AGN的吸积速率，并且紧凑的射电喷流有足够的能量来推动高度电离的流出气体。因此，NGC 7469内的气体流入和流出处于自我调节的供给-反馈过程中，射电喷流的贡献有助于推动流出气体。 <div>
We present new JWST NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data for the luminous infrared galaxy NGC 7469, a nearby (70.6 Mpc) active galaxy with a Seyfert 1.5 nucleus that drives a highly ionized gas outflow and a prominent nuclear star-forming ring. Using the superb sensitivity and high spatial resolution of the JWST instrument NIRSpec IFS, we investigate the role of the Seyfert nucleus in the excitation and dynamics of the circumnuclear gas. Our analysis focuses on the [Fe ii], H2, and hydrogen recombination lines that trace the radiation/shocked-excited molecular and ionized interstellar medium around the active galactic nucleus (AGN). We investigate gas excitation through H2/Brγ and [Fe ii]/Paβ emission line ratios and find that photoionization by the AGN dominates within the central 300 pc of the galaxy except in a small region that shows signatures of shock-heated gas; these shock-heated regions are likely associated with a compact radio jet. In addition, the velocity field and velocity dispersion maps reveal complex gas kinematics. Rotation is the dominant feature, but we also identify noncircular motions consistent with gas inflows as traced by the velocity residuals and the spiral pattern in the Paα velocity dispersion map. The inflow is 2 orders of magnitude higher than the AGN accretion rate. The compact nuclear radio jet has enough power to drive the highly ionized outflow. This scenario suggests that the inflow and outflow are in a self-regulating feeding–feedback process, with a contribution from the radio jet helping to drive the outflow.

总结: 本研究通过对小麦哲伦云中X射线暂现星SXP 18.3的观测，首次成功地演示了使用卡尔曼滤波器分析来唯一测量磁偶极矩μ。传统方法无法唯一推断μ，但通过卡尔曼滤波器分析可以避免辐射效率η0的问题。此外，研究还得出了时间分辨率的隐含状态变量估计，如质量吸积率和磁盘-磁层边界处的最大应力。这一成功的演示证实了卡尔曼滤波器分析可用于将来研究小麦哲伦云和其他地方的吸积驱动脉冲星群体的磁矩和盘-磁层物理学。 <div>
The magnetic dipole moment μ of an accretion-powered pulsar in magnetocentrifugal equilibrium cannot be inferred uniquely from time-averaged pulse period and aperiodic X-ray flux data, because the radiative efficiency η0 of the accretion is unknown, as are the mass, radius, and distance of the star. The degeneracy associated with the radiative efficiency is circumvented if fluctuations of the pulse period and aperiodic X-ray flux are tracked with a Kalman filter, whereupon μ can be measured uniquely up to the uncertainties in the mass, radius, and distance. Here, the Kalman filter analysis is demonstrated successfully in practice for the first time on Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations of the X-ray transient SXP 18.3 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), which is monitored regularly. The analysis yields and , compared to as inferred traditionally from time-averaged data assuming η0 = 1. The analysis also yields time-resolved estimates of two hidden state variables, the mass accretion rate and the Maxwell stress at the disk–magnetosphere boundary. The success of the demonstration confirms that the Kalman filter analysis can be applied in the future to study the magnetic moments and disk–magnetosphere physics of accretion-powered pulsar populations in the SMC and elsewhere.

Galaxies play a key role in our endeavor to understand how structure formation proceeds in the Universe. For any precision study of cosmology or galaxy formation, there is a strong demand for huge sets of realistic mock galaxy catalogs, spanning cosmologically significant volumes. For such a daunting task, methods that can produce a direct mapping between dark matter halos from dark matter-only simulations and galaxies are strongly preferred, as producing mocks from full-fledged hydrodynamical simulations or semi-analytical models is too expensive. Here, we present a graph-neural-network-based model that is able to accurately predict key properties of galaxies such as stellar mass, g − r color, star formation rate, gas mass, stellar metallicity, and gas metallicity, purely from dark matter properties extracted from halos along the full assembly history of the galaxies. Tests based on the TNG300 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project show that our model can recover the baryonic properties of galaxies to high accuracy, over a wide redshift range (z = 0–5), for all galaxies with stellar masses more massive than 109M⊙ and their progenitors, with strong improvements over the state-of-the-art methods. We further show that our method makes substantial strides toward providing an understanding of the implications of the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model.

Recent Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations have revealed an increasing number of compact protostellar disks with radii of less than a few tens of astronomical units and that young Class 0/I objects have an intrinsic size diversity. To deepen our understanding of the origin of such tiny disks, we have performed highest-resolution configuration observations with ALMA at a beam size of ∼0.″03 (4 au) on the very low-luminosity Class 0 protostar embedded in the Taurus dense core MC 27/L1521F. The 1.3 mm continuum measurement successfully resolved a tiny, faint (∼1 mJy) disk with a major axis length of ∼10 au, one of the smallest examples in the ALMA protostellar studies. In addition, we detected spike-like components in the northeastern direction at the disk edge. Gravitational instability or other fragmentation mechanisms cannot explain the structures, given the central stellar mass of ∼0.2 M⊙ and the disk mass of ≳10−4M⊙. Instead, we propose that these small spike structures were formed by a recent dynamic magnetic flux transport event due to interchange instability that would be favorable to occur if the parental core has a strong magnetic field. The presence of complex arc-like structures on a larger (∼2000 au) scale in the same direction as the spike structures suggests that the event was not single. Such episodic, dynamical events may play an important role in maintaining the compact nature of the protostellar disk in the complex gas envelope during the main accretion phase.

总结: 本文研究了银河系中多尺度的热气体温度结构。通过分析XMM-Newton存档中的O vii、O viii和Fe-L带发射特征，定义了两个温度示踪器O87和FeO，并发现单一温度碰撞电离模型无法解释这两个比值。研究还展现了银河系中三个大尺度的热气体特征：银河中心的eROSITA气泡、盘状结构和晕轮。通过自相关函数和交叉相关函数的分析，发现热气体存在着与星形成区域或超新星遗迹相关的X射线气泡，同时还展现了热气体与紫外线检测到的温暖气体之间的有趣反相关关系。 <div>
This paper presents the multiscale temperature structures in the Milky Way (MW) hot gas, as part of the XMM-Newton Line Emission Analysis Program, surveying the O vii, O viii, and Fe-L band emission features in the XMM-Newton archive. In particular, we define two temperature tracers, IOVIII/IOVII (O87) and IFeL/(IOVII + IOVIII) (FeO). These two ratios cannot be explained simultaneously using single-temperature collisional ionization models, which indicates the need for multitemperature structures in hot gas. In addition, we show three large-scale features in the hot gas: the eROSITA bubbles around the Galactic center (GC), the disk, and the halo. In the eROSITA bubbles, the observed line ratios can be explained by a log-normal temperature distribution with a median of and a scatter of σT ≈ 0.2 dex. Beyond the bubbles, the line ratio dependence on the Galactic latitude suggests higher temperatures around the midplane of the MW disk. The scale height of the temperature variation is estimated to be ≈2 kpc assuming an average distance of 5 kpc for the hot gas. The halo component is characterized by the dependence on the distance to the GC, showing a temperature decline from to 5.8. Furthermore, we extract the autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions to investigate the small-scale structures. O87 and FeO ratios show a consistent autocorrelation scale of ≈5° (i.e., ≈400 pc at 5 kpc), which is consistent with the expected physical sizes of X-ray bubbles associated with star-forming regions or supernova remnants. Finally, we examine the cross-correlation between the hot and UV-detected warm gas and show an intriguing anticorrelation.

<title>COSMOS-Web: Intrinsically Luminous z ≳ 10 Galaxy Candidates Test Early Stellar Mass Assembly</title>

We report the discovery of 15 exceptionally luminous 10 ≲ z ≲ 14 candidate galaxies discovered in the first 0.28 deg2 of JWST/NIRCam imaging from the COSMOS-Web survey. These sources span rest-frame UV magnitudes of −20.5 > MUV > −22, and thus constitute the most intrinsically luminous z ≳ 10 candidates identified by JWST to date. Selected via NIRCam imaging, deep ground-based observations corroborate their detection and help significantly constrain their photometric redshifts. We analyze their spectral energy distributions using multiple open-source codes and evaluate the probability of low-redshift solutions; we conclude that 12/15 (80%) are likely genuine z ≳ 10 sources and 3/15 (20%) likely low-redshift contaminants. Three of our z ∼ 12 candidates push the limits of early stellar mass assembly: they have estimated stellar masses ∼ 5 × 109M⊙, implying an effective stellar baryon fraction of ϵ⋆ ∼ 0.2−0.5, where ϵ⋆ ≡ M⋆/(fbMhalo). The assembly of such stellar reservoirs is made possible due to rapid, burst-driven star formation on timescales < 100 Myr where the star formation rate may far outpace the growth of the underlying dark matter halos. This is supported by the similar volume densities inferred for M⋆ ∼ 1010M⊙ galaxies relative to M⋆ ∼ 109M⊙—both about 10−6 Mpc−3—implying they live in halos of comparable mass. At such high redshifts, the duty cycle for starbursts would be of order unity, which could cause the observed change in the shape of the UV luminosity function from a double power law to a Schechter function at z ≈ 8. Spectroscopic redshift confirmation and ensuing constraints of their masses will be critical to understand how, and if, such early massive galaxies push the limits of galaxy formation in the Lambda cold dark matter paradigm.

总结: 该研究调查了原始大气中X射线和紫外光诱导光蒸发的扩散极限。研究发现，由于受到粒子碰撞较少的顶层大气控制，质量损失导致的成分分馏比目前认为的更为显著。顶层大气中的这种分馏导致形成向下延伸的成分梯度。质量流出最终达到稳定状态，其中氢损失受到扩散限制。我们推导了扩散限制质量流失速率和交叉质量的新的解析表达式。 <div>
Photoevaporation is thought to play an important role in early planetary evolution. In this study, we investigate the diffusion limit of X-ray- and ultraviolet-induced photoevaporation in primordial atmospheres. We find that compositional fractionation resulting from mass loss is more significant than currently recognized, because it is controlled by the conditions at the top of the atmosphere, where particle collisions are less frequent. Such fractionation at the top of the atmosphere develops a compositional gradient that extends downward. The mass outflow eventually reaches a steady state in which the hydrogen loss is diffusion-limited. We derive new analytic expressions for the diffusion-limited mass-loss rate and the crossover mass.

<div> TESS, photometry, AM Her, AR UMa, accretion
<br /><br />
这篇文章讨论了绕爆发变星AM Herculis（AM Her）和AR Ursae Majoris（AR UMa）的照度测量，以及高速光度测量。AM Her显示出多种高能态，经常在它们之间进行转换。低能态AR UMa的TESS光度测量没有显示出吸积的证据，而麦克唐纳2.1米望远镜捕捉到AR UMa处于高吸积态。AR UMa的低能态时罗切波溢出被关闭，而AM Her的低能态通常仍然发生吸积。我们推导出AM Her和AR UMa的倾斜角分别为50°和70°。为了对AM Her的高能态光变曲线进行建模，我们采用了自组织图光变分类方案，以建立常见的吸积结构。然后，轨道辐射特性可用于在白矮星表面上生产发射区域地图。AM Her的吸积几何结构最符合多极场结构。AR UMa的高能态具有随机吸积耀斑，我们将其归因于通过内拉格朗日点L1的磁碰撞质量转移。为了考虑这种可能性，我们检查了两颗恒星的磁性，并认为L1附近的局部磁场可以引发短暂的吸积事件，并影响AM Her和AR UMa之间的高低能态转换。特别是，AR UMa的默认状态是低能态，而AM Her和大多数其他的活跃的爆发变星的默认状态是高能态。
<br /><br />总结: TESS卫星对AM Her和AR UMa进行了照度测量，并发现它们在高、低能态之间频繁转换。AR UMa的低能态下没有吸积迹象，但在高能态下由麦克唐纳2.1米望远镜观测到了强吸积。AM Her和AR UMa的倾斜角分别为50°和70°。AM Her的吸积几何结构最符合多极场结构，而AR UMa的高能态表现出随机吸积耀斑，磁碰撞质量转移可能导致这种现象。 <div>
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry of the polars AM Herculis (AM Her) and AR Ursae Majoris (AR UMa) is presented, along with high-speed photometry. AM Her shows a variety of high states with frequent transitions between them. TESS photometry of AR UMa in the low state reveals no evidence of accretion, while the McDonald 2.1 m telescope caught AR UMa in its high accretion state. Roche-lobe overflow is shut off during low states of AR UMa, while accretion often still takes place during low states of AM Her. We derive inclinations of 50° and 70° for AM Her and AR UMa respectively. To model the high-state light curves of AM Her, we employ a self-organized map light-curve classification scheme to establish common accretion configurations. The cyclotron radiation properties then allow the production of emission region maps on the surface of the white dwarf. The accretion geometry of AM Her is most consistent with a multipolar field structure. The high-state photometry of AR UMa has stochastic accretion flaring, which we attribute to magnetically buffeted mass transfer through the inner Lagrangian point L1. To consider this possibility, we examine the magnetism of both stars and argue that the local magnetic field near L1 can initiate short-lived accretion events and affect transitions between high and low accretion states in both AM Her and AR UMa. In particular, AR UMa has the low state as its default, while AM Her and most other active polars are in the high state by default.

<div> BCDs,星团群落,星系,持续恒定的星形成,星系演化
总结:<br /><br />这项研究使用哈勃太空望远镜的高分辨率图像对ESO185-IG13、ESO338-IG04和Haro11三个蓝色紧凑矮星系(BCD)的星团群落进行了研究，首次探索了100百万年之前的星团群落。BCDs据信会在长期的寂静期之后经历强烈的星形成爆发，但关于这些爆发的时间、频率、持续时间和强度以及它们的星形成历史知之甚少。研究发现，被研究的三个星系中的星团群落分布色彩各异，因此具有独特的星团群落和星形成历史。通过假设星团质量函数的归一化与宿主星系的星形成率之间的关联，研究人员建立了基于星团的星形成历史，发现只有Haro11目前正经历着一次爆发，而ESO185在10到40百万年前曾经历了增强的星形成，ESO338在过去几十亿年中的星形成历史相对持续稳定。这些发现表明，并非所有BCDs都在目前经历星形成爆发，并且一些星系在过去几十亿年中一直以相当稳定的速率形成星团和星系（变化幅度大约为2-3倍）。这一情景类似于矮星系和矮星爆星系的星形成历史，它们的星形成率比BCDs低10-1000倍。 <div>
We present a new study of the cluster populations in the blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCD) ESO185-IG13, ESO338-IG04, and Haro11, based on new and archival high-resolution images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, and the first to probe the populations older than ≈100 Myr. BCDs are believed to experience intense bursts of star formation (including at the present day) after long periods of quiescence, but little is known about the timing, frequency, duration, and strength of these bursts or about their star formation histories in general. We find that the cluster population in each of the three galaxies studied here has its own unique distribution of colors and hence a unique cluster and star formation history. From an assumed correlation between the normalization of the cluster mass function and the star formation rate of the host galaxy, we construct cluster-based star formation histories over the past ≈few × Gyr and find that only Haro11 is currently experiencing a burst (≈factor of 10 increase in the rate of star formation for the last ≈20 Myr), whereas ESO185 experienced enhanced star formation (by a factor ≈4) between 10 and 40 Myr ago, and ESO338 has had a fairly constant SFH over the past few Gyr. These findings indicate that not all BCDs are experiencing a burst of star formation at the present day, and that some have been forming stars and clusters at a fairly steady rate (within a factor of ≈2–3) over the past few Gyr. This scenario is similar to the histories of dwarf irregular and dwarf starburst galaxies, which have star formation rates that are 10–1000 times lower than those in BCDs.

The nearby type II supernova, SN 2023ixf in M101 exhibits signatures of early time interaction with circumstellar material in the first week postexplosion. This material may be the consequence of prior mass loss suffered by the progenitor, which possibly manifested in the form of a detectable presupernova outburst. We present an analysis of long-baseline preexplosion photometric data in the g, w, r, i, z, and y filters from Pan-STARRS as part of the Young Supernova Experiment, spanning ∼5000 days. We find no significant detections in the Pan-STARRS preexplosion light curves. We train a multilayer perceptron neural network to classify presupernova outbursts. We find no evidence of eruptive presupernova activity to a limiting absolute magnitude of −7 mag. The limiting magnitudes from the full set of gwrizy (average absolute magnitude ≈ −8 mag) data are consistent with previous preexplosion studies. We use deep photometry from the literature to constrain the progenitor of SN 2023ixf, finding that these data are consistent with a dusty red supergiant progenitor with luminosity ≈ 5.12 and temperature ≈ 3950 K, corresponding to a mass of 14–20 M⊙.

研究太阳探测器帕克太阳探测器(PSP)在接近太阳时的太阳风湍流各向异性。使用Adhikari等人的方法，导出了理论方程，计算了在惯性范围内的二维和板条磁能量、动能的波动比率以及向外/向内的Elsässer能量。在能量含量范围内，我们假设波数k−1的幂律关系。在惯性范围内，磁场波动和向外/向内的Elsässer能量，我们考虑(1)二维和板条波动都服从k−5/3的幂律，以及(2)二维和板条波动分别服从k−5/3和k−3/2的幂律。对于速度波动，我们假设二维和板条成分都服从k−3/2的幂律。我们将惯性范围内的理论方差各向异性与PSP测得的观测值进行比较，发现二维波动的能量密度大于板条波动。而在关于二维和板条湍流之间的k−5/3和k−3/2幂率的理论方差各向异性方面，显示出比假设相同的k−5/3幂率更小的值。最后，PSP测得的湍流能量在能量含量范围内与几乎不可压缩/板条湍流描述的理论结果相似。
<br /><br />总结: 本研究使用PSP接近太阳进行的遇到数据，对太阳风湍流的各向异性进行了研究。通过理论推导和观测比较，得出了二维波动的能量密度大于板条波动的结论。此外，在磁场波动的幂率方面，采用k−5/3和k−3/2的理论值得出的理论结果更小。最后，实测的湍流能量与几乎不可压缩/板条湍流描述的理论结果相似。 <div>
We study solar wind turbulence anisotropy in the inertial and energy-containing ranges in the inbound and outbound directions during encounters 1–9 by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) for distances between ∼21 and 65 R⊙. Using the Adhikari et al. approach, we derive theoretical equations to calculate the ratio between the 2D and slab fluctuating magnetic energy, fluctuating kinetic energy, and the outward/inward Elsässer energy in the inertial range. For this, in the energy-containing range, we assume a wavenumber k−1 power law. In the inertial range, for the magnetic field fluctuations and the outward/inward Elsässer energy, we consider that (i) both 2D and slab fluctuations follow a power law of k−5/3, and (ii) the 2D and slab fluctuations follow the power laws with k−5/3 and k−3/2, respectively. For the velocity fluctuations, we assume that both the 2D and slab components follow a k−3/2 power law. We compare the theoretical results of the variance anisotropy in the inertial range with the derived observational values measured by PSP, and find that the energy density of 2D fluctuations is larger than that of the slab fluctuations. The theoretical variance anisotropy in the inertial range relating to the k−5/3 and k−3/2 power laws between 2D and slab turbulence exhibits a smaller value in comparison to assuming the same power law k−5/3 between 2D and slab turbulence. Finally, the observed turbulence energy measured by PSP in the energy-containing range is found to be similar to the theoretical result of a nearly incompressible/slab turbulence description.

总结：<br />
本文提出了一种基于块矩阵乘法规则的光谱展宽函数（BF）的扩展形式，称为二进制BF（BBF）。该方法可以使用两个光谱模板为二进制星系统的各个组成部分产生分解的BF，并用于推导单个组分的精确旋转剖面和径向速度。通过对模拟光谱和实际观测光谱进行测试，证明了该方法在光谱双星系统上是可行的，即使两个恒星组分的光谱线严重重叠。我们还通过模拟实施了使用BBF进行“勾画”（成像）食双星行星的能力。此外，我们还讨论了实施问题，例如BBF随偏差模板的变化，BBF的利弊以及不适用该方法的情况。 <div>
We propose an extended formalism for the spectral broadening function (BF) based on the multiplication rule of block matrices. The formalism, which we named the binary BF (BBF), can produce decomposed BFs for individual components of a binary star system by using two spectral templates. The decomposed BFs can be used to derive precise rotational profiles and radial velocities for individual components. We test the BBF on simulated spectra and actual observational spectra to show that the method is feasible on spectroscopic binaries, even when the spectral lines of two stellar components are heavily blended. To demonstrate the capability of the method, we conduct a simulation of “sketching” (imaging) a transiting circumbinary exoplanet using the BBF. We also discuss issues of implementation such as the variation of BBF with biased templates, the pros and cons of BBF, and cases when the method is not applicable.

If a Galactic core-collapse supernova explosion occurs in the future, it will be critical to rapidly alert the community to the direction of the supernova by utilizing neutrino signals in order to enable the initiation of follow-up optical observations. In addition, there is anticipation that observation of the diffuse supernova neutrino background will yield discoveries in the near future, given that experimental upper limits are approaching theoretical predictions. We have developed a new supernova event simulator for water Cherenkov neutrino detectors, such as the highly sensitive Super-Kamiokande. This simulator calculates the neutrino interaction in water for two simulation purposes, individual core-collapse supernova bursts and diffuse supernova neutrino background. Based on this simulator, we can evaluate the precision in determining the location of supernovae and estimate the expected number of events related to the diffuse supernova neutrino background in Super-Kamiokande. In this paper, we describe the basic structure of the simulator and its demonstration.

本研究首次使用仅近红外数据对超新星同胞进行分析。通过对已发表的近红外光度数据进行校准，并使用SALT3-NIR和SNooPy模型拟合光度曲线，发现同胞之间绝对视星等差异中位数为0.248和0.186等级。通过模拟实验估计了这些差异的不确定性，并发现统计上，在近红外波段不存在内在散射的可能性。与仅使用光学数据相比，同一组超新星同胞之间的绝对视星等差异中位数为0.177等级。目前尚不清楚这些结果是由于统计数据不足还是近红外数据质量不佳，这些问题都将在南希·格雷斯·罗曼空间望远镜的使用中得到改善。 <div>
The study of supernova (SN) siblings, supernovae with the same host galaxy, is an important avenue for understanding and measuring the properties of Type Ia SN Ia light curves (LCs). Thus far, sibling analyses have mainly focused on optical LC data. Considering that LCs in the near-infrared (NIR) are expected to be better standard candles than those in the optical, we carry out the first analysis compiling SN siblings with only NIR data. We perform an extensive literature search of all SN siblings and find six sets of siblings with published NIR photometry. We calibrate each set of siblings ensuring they are on homogeneous photometric systems, fit the LCs with the SALT3-NIR and SNooPy models, and find median absolute differences in μ values between siblings of 0.248 and 0.186 mag, respectively. To evaluate the significance of these differences beyond measurement noise, we run simulations that mimic these LCs and provide an estimate for uncertainty on these median absolute differences of ∼0.052 mag, and we find that, statistically, our analysis rules out the nonexistence of intrinsic scatter in the NIR at the 99% level. When comparing the same sets of SN siblings, we observe a median absolute difference in μ values between siblings of 0.177 mag when using optical data alone as compared to 0.186 mag when using NIR data alone. It is unclear if these results may be due to limited statistics or poor quality NIR data, all of which will be improved with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

本文介绍了使用机器学习模型预测球状星团（GCs）中的中等质量黑洞（IMBHs）的方法及其局限性。作者使用 anchors 方法和 Certifiably Optimal RulE ListS (CORELS) 在解释性和可解释性方面进行了研究，以解决模型的不透明性问题。他们还通过测量模拟数据的真实性来评估模型的偏见，以减轻模型在外推时产生偏见预测的风险。最后，他们将这些分类器应用于真实GC数据，得到了预测的分类、预测置信度、异常值检测等信息。文章提出了对于GC中IMBH的预测方法，并对模型的解释性和泛化能力进行了深入探讨。 <div>
Definitive evidence that globular clusters (GCs) host intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) is elusive. Machine-learning (ML) models trained on GC simulations can in principle predict IMBH host candidates based on observable features. This approach has two limitations: first, an accurate ML model is expected to be a black box due to complexity; second, despite our efforts to simulate GCs realistically, the simulation physics or initial conditions may fail to reflect reality fully. Therefore our training data may be biased, leading to a failure in generalization to observational data. Both the first issue—explainability/interpretability—and the second—out of distribution generalization and fairness—are active areas of research in ML. Here we employ techniques from these fields to address them: we use the anchors method to explain an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifier; we also independently train a natively interpretable model using Certifiably Optimal RulE ListS (CORELS). The resulting model has a clear physical meaning, but loses some performance with respect to XGBoost. We evaluate potential candidates in real data based not only on classifier predictions but also on their similarity to the training data, measured by the likelihood of a kernel density estimation model. This measures the realism of our simulated data and mitigates the risk that our models may produce biased predictions by working in extrapolation. We apply our classifiers to real GCs, obtaining a predicted classification, a measure of the confidence of the prediction, an out-of-distribution flag, a local rule explaining the prediction of XGBoost, and a global rule from CORELS.

总结:
本文研究了气态巨行星与其母恒星和它的系外卫星之间的磁性和潮汐相互作用，重点关注它们的保留情况。首先，讨论了行星地核生成的标度定律，然后根据维里定理构建了行星磁场的演化规律，并发现初始熵对高质量行星的磁场演化非常重要。在估计了星-行星和行星-卫星磁相互作用引起的磁力矩后，发现它可以补偿潮汐力，并绕过动力潮汐响应无效的频谷。对于卫星的保留，考虑了两种情况。在存在环绕行星的盘的情况下，通过比较盘的内外半径，发现磁场过强或与母恒星距离过近的行星很难容纳卫星。在后续的无盘演化中，通过比较行星的减速和卫星迁移的时间尺度，发现几天周期的热木星不太可能保留大型卫星，尽管它们可以被来自被潮汐瓦解的卫星碎片形成的环围绕。与此相反，围绕温暖或寒冷木星形成的卫星可以被保留。最后，我们估算了由星-行星和行星-卫星磁相互作用导致的射电功率和流量密度，并给出了通过FAST探测的上限距离。 <div>
We study the magnetic and tidal interactions of a gas-giant exoplanet with its host star and with its exomoons, and focus on their retention. We briefly revisit the scaling law for planetary dynamo in terms of its mass, radius, and luminosity. Based on the virial theorem, we construct an evolution law for planetary magnetic field and find that its initial entropy is important for the field evolution of a high-mass planet. We estimate the magnetic torques on orbit arising from the star–planet and planet–moon magnetic interactions, and find that it can compensate tidal torques and bypass frequency valleys where dynamical-tide response is ineffective. For exomoon’s retention, we consider two situations. In the presence of a circumplanetary disk (CPD), by comparison between CPD’s inner and outer radii, we find that planets with too strong magnetic fields or too small distance from its host star tend not to host exomoons. During the subsequent CPD-free evolution, we find, by comparison between a planet’s spin-down and a moon’s migration timescales, that hot Jupiters with periods of several days are unlikely to retain large exomoons, albeit they could be surrounded by rings from the debris of tidally disrupted moons. In contrast, moons, if formed around warm or cold Jupiters, can be preserved. Finally, we estimate the radio power and flux density due to the star–planet and planet–moon magnetic interactions and give the upper limit of detection distance by FAST.

Recently, the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 has garnered attention due to its emission of an extremely luminous radio burst, reminiscent of fast radio bursts (FRBs). SGR J1935+2154 is one of the most active magnetars, displaying flaring events nearly every year, including outbursts as well as short and intermediate bursts. Here, we present our results on the properties of the persistent and bursting X-ray emission from SGR J1935+2154 during the initial weeks following its outburst on 2022 October 10. The source was observed with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR (quasi-)simultaneously during two epochs, separated by ∼5 days. The persistent emission spectrum is well described by an absorbed blackbody plus power-law model up to an energy of ∼25 keV. No significant changes were observed in the blackbody temperature (kTBB ∼ 0.4 keV) and emitting radius (RBB ∼ 1.9 km) between the two epochs. However, we observed a slight variation in the power-law parameters. Moreover, we detected X-ray pulsations in all the data sets and derived a spin-period derivative of s s−1. This is 3.8 times larger than the value measured after the first recorded outburst in 2014. Additionally, we performed quasi-simultaneous radio observations using three 25–32 m class radio telescopes for a total of 92.5 hr to search for FRB-like radio bursts and pulsed emission. However, our analysis did not reveal any radio bursts or periodic emission.

HR 1099是一个活跃的双星系统，通过进行多周期的天文测量和射电定位，发现射电位置在共动参考系中定义了一个椭圆轨道。射电重心在所有阶段都偏离了双星质心，排除了来自双星区域的辐射。在测量速度时发现，大多数阶段测得的速度并不显著，但在一个耀斑期间，检测到了与观测到的太阳日冕物质抛射平均速度相当的速度。这些发现有助于我们更好地了解这个活跃的双星系统的性质。

总结: <br /> HR 1099是一个活跃的双星系统，通过进行多周期的天文测量和射电定位，发现射电位置在共动参考系中定义了一个椭圆轨道。射电重心在所有阶段都偏离了双星质心，排除了来自双星区域的辐射。在测量速度时发现，大多数阶段测得的速度并不显著，但在一个耀斑期间，检测到了与观测到的太阳日冕物质抛射平均速度相当的速度。 <div>
We report multiepoch astrometric very long baseline interferometry observations of the chromospherically active binary HR 1099 (V711 Tau, HD 22468) at six epochs over 63 days using the Very Long Baseline Array at 22.2 GHz. We determined hourly radio positions at each epoch with a positional uncertainty significantly smaller than the component separation. The aggregate radio positions at all epochs define an ellipse in the comoving reference frame with an inclination and longitude of ascending node Ω = 212° ± 22°. The ellipse center is offset from the Third Gaia Celestial Reference Frame position by Δα = , Δδ = mas. All radio centroids are well displaced from the binary center of mass at all epochs, ruling out emission from the interbinary region. We examined the motion of the radio centroids within each epoch by comparing hourly positions over several hours. The measured speeds were not statistically significant for five of the six epochs, with 2σ upper limits in the range 200–1000 km s−1. However, for one flaring epoch, there was a 3σ detection v⊥ = 228 ± 85 km s−1. This speed is comparable to the mean speed of observed coronal mass ejections on the Sun.

总结:<br /><br />本文报告了对SN 2022jox的高频光学和紫外线观测结果。该超新星展现出早期光谱中的高电离闪烁特征，并在爆炸后的几天内消失。SN 2022jox在爆发后约0.75天被Distance Less Than 40 Mpc survey发现，并随后获得了光谱和紫外光度的跟进数据。超新星达到了峰值亮度MV∼−17.3 mag，估计的56Ni质量为0.04 M⊙，这是正常II型超新星的典型数值。对早期光变曲线的建模和光谱中的闪烁特征表明了与周围物质的相互作用，这些物质是由一个具有质量损失率的前体星产生的。SN 2022jox的质量损失率远高于已知II型超新星前体——红超巨星的平静质量损失率，但与类似的核心坍缩超新星的推断值相当，这表明爆炸前几个月或几年内前体星发生了喷发事件或超级风。此外，在大约200天的光谱中还有一些迟发的CSM相互作用的迹象。 <div>
We present high-cadence optical and ultraviolet (UV) observations of the Type II supernova (SN), SN 2022jox which exhibits early spectroscopic high-ionization flash features of H i, He ii, C iv, and N iv that disappear within the first few days after explosion. SN 2022jox was discovered by the Distance Less Than 40 Mpc survey ∼0.75 day after explosion with follow-up spectra and UV photometry obtained within minutes of discovery. The SN reached a peak brightness of MV ∼ −17.3 mag, and has an estimated 56Ni mass of 0.04 M⊙, typical values for normal Type II SNe. The modeling of the early light curve and the strong flash signatures present in the optical spectra indicate interaction with circumstellar material (CSM) created from a progenitor with a mass-loss rate of . There may also be some indication of late-time CSM interaction in the form of an emission line blueward of Hα seen in spectra around 200 days. The mass-loss rate of SN 2022jox is much higher than the values typically associated with quiescent mass loss from red supergiants, the known progenitors of Type II SNe, but is comparable to inferred values from similar core-collapse SNe with flash features, suggesting an eruptive event or a superwind in the progenitor in the months or years before explosion.

总结:<br />
这篇文章研究了弱线类星体的特性，针对活动星系核的光谱能量分布进行了云模拟计算，发现C iv的等效宽度会受到软X射线过剩组分的影响，而具有较大黑洞质量和软X射线较弱的类星体会表现出较弱的紫外线发射线。 <div>
Weak-line quasars (WLQs) are a notable group of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that show unusually weak UV lines even though their optical-UV continuum shapes are similar to those of typical quasars. The physical mechanism for WLQs is an unsolved puzzle in the AGN unified model. We explore the properties of UV emission lines by performing extensive photoionization calculations based on Cloudy simulations with different spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of AGNs. The AGN continua are built from several observational empirical correlations, where the blackbody emission from the cold disk, the power-law emission from the hot corona, and a soft X-ray excess component are considered. We find that the equivalent width (EW) of C iv from our models is systematically lower than observational values if the component of soft X-ray excess is neglected. The EW will increase several times and is roughly consistent with the observations after considering the soft X-ray excess component as constrained from normal type I AGNs. We find that the UV lines are weak for QSOs with quite large black hole mass (e.g., MBH > 109M⊙) and weak soft X-ray emission due to the deficit of ionizing photons. As an example, we present the strength of C iv based on the multiband SEDs for three nearby weak-line AGNs, where the weaker soft X-ray emission normally predicts the weaker lines.

这篇文章报告了对T2.5行星质量物体SIMP J013656.5+093347进行的J-和Ks-波段多波长观测的分析结果。研究重新分析了2015年一夜的观测数据，并首次检测到J-和Ks-波段光度曲线之间存在相位差。研究利用Sonora Bobcat模型表明，为了解释观测到的相位差，该物体的大气层中必须至少存在两个不同的云层。这一结果与该物体的大气检测结果一致，也与其他类似L/T转变物体的最新研究结果一致。 <br /><br />总结: 多波长光度测量揭示了SIMP J013656.5+093347大气层中存在至少两个不同的云层，与最新的大气检测结果一致。 <div>
Multiwavelength photometry of brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects provides insight into their atmospheres and cloud layers. We present near-simultaneous J- and Ks-band multiwavelength observations of the highly variable T2.5 planetary-mass object, SIMP J013656.5+093347. We reanalyze observations acquired over a single night in 2015 using a recently developed data reduction pipeline. For the first time, we detect a phase shift between J- and Ks-band light curves, which we measure to be . Previously, phase shifts between near-infrared and mid-infrared observations of this object were detected and attributed to probing different depths of the atmosphere, and thus different cloud layers. Using the Sonora Bobcat models, we expand on this idea to show that at least two different patchy cloud layers must be present to explain the measured phase shift. Our results are generally consistent with recent atmospheric retrievals of this object and other similar L/T transition objects.

Ganymede的微型磁层与朱庇特等离子体的共旋流相互作用产生Alfvénic power，为木卫三在朱庇特电离层形成极光足迹做出贡献。研究使用了木卫三磁层的三维、高分辨率全球磁流体力学模型，调查了在稳态上游条件下木卫三磁层中产生的Alfvénic power的时间变化。结果显示：（1）由于磁重联和Kelvin-Helmholtz不稳定性引起的Alfvénic power呈准周期性变化，周期约为71-333秒，与木卫三极光足迹发出功率的100秒周期性一致；（2）当木卫三位于朱庇特等离子体片区内，其朱轴磁场成分较小，Alfvénic power的大小也较小，而当木卫三位于等离子体片区外时，朱轴磁场较大，Alfvénic power也较大。 
<br /><br />总结: 
Ganymede的微型磁层与Jovian等离子体流相互作用产生Alfvénic power，其变化周期与Ganymede极光足迹发出功率周期一致。Alfvénic power的大小与Ganymede所处位置的Jovian等离子体片区的By分量大小相关。 <div>
Alfvénic power is generated through the interaction between the mini-magnetosphere of Ganymede and the corotating flow of the Jovian plasma, contributing to the formation of the Ganymede auroral footprint at Jupiter’s ionosphere. Using a three-dimensional, high-resolution global magnetohydrodynamic model of the Ganymede magnetosphere, we investigate the temporal variations of the Alfvénic power generated in the mini-magnetosphere of the moon under steady-state upstream conditions. Results show that (1) the Alfvénic power caused by the intermittent magnetic reconnections and the Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities is quasiperiodic, varying over time with the periods about 71–333 s, which are consistent with the 100 s timescale periodicities of the Ganymede footprint's emitted power; and (2) the magnitude of the Alfvénic power is smaller when Ganymede is inside the Jovian plasma sheet where the By component is smaller, and larger when the moon is outside the plasma sheet where the By component is larger.

Recent observational and simulation studies have revealed that ambipolar diffusion is an important phenomenon in the outer regions of a protoplanetary disk (PPD). However, numerous simulation studies have found that ambipolar diffusion suppresses the turbulence caused by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in these regions of a PPD. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of ambipolar diffusion on the Rossby wave instability (RWI) at large radii of a PPD. To accomplish this, we examine the occurrence of the RWI in a PPD threaded by the magnetic field in the presence of ambipolar diffusion. Additionally, we scale the ambipolar diffusivity with respect to both the toroidal magnetic field and an important parameter known as the Elsässer number. We obtain the growth rate of unstable RWI modes in the outer regions of a PPD using linear perturbation analysis. In our nonaxisymmetric perturbation analysis, we find that the amplitude of the toroidal field oscillates in various modes for small values of the Elsässer numbers. For small Elsässer numbers, the growth rate of unstable modes associated with the RWI decreases. In other words, ambipolar diffusion suppresses the perturbation caused by the RWI. This effect is similar to the effect of ambipolar diffusion on the MRI. In contrast to the MRI, where there is a range around 1 for the Elsässer numbers, the existence of ambipolar diffusion supports the occurrence of RWI. Finally, we compare our findings with those of simulation studies to emphasize the importance of RWI in the outer regions of a PPD.

<title>Prospects of Identifying Hierarchical Triple Mergers for the Third-generation Ground-based Detectors</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A hierarchical triple merger (HTM) constitutes a type of event in which two successive black hole (BH) mergers occur sequentially within the observational window of gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, which has an important role in testing general relativity and studying BH population. In this work, we conduct an analysis to determine the feasibility of identifying HTMs from a large GW event catalog using third-generation ground-based GW detectors. By comparing the Bhattacharyya coefficient that measures the overlap between the posterior distributions of the remnant and progenitor BH parameters, we find that the overlap between the event pair can serve as a preliminary filter, which balances between computational demand and the probability of false alarms. Following this initial, time-efficient, yet less accurate screening, a subset of potential HTM candidates will be retained. These candidates will subsequently be subjected to a more precise, albeit time-intensive, method of joint parameter estimation for verification. Ultimately, this process will enable us to robustly identify HTMs.

The thorium and six second-peak r-process element (56 ≤ Z ≤ 72) abundances are determined for the α-poor star LAMOST J1124+4535 based on a high-resolution spectrum obtained with the High Dispersion Spectrograph on the Subaru Telescope. The age of J1124+4535 is 11.3 ± 4.4 Gyr using thorium and other r-process element abundances. J1124+4535 is confirmed to be a Galactic halo metal-poor ([Fe/H] = −1.27 ± 0.1) star with extreme r-process element overabundance ([Eu/Fe] = 1.13 ± 0.08) and α element deficiency ([Mg/Fe] = −0.31 ± 0.09) by the LAMOST-Subaru project. Along with the subsolar α-to-iron ratios (e.g., [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe]), the relatively low abundances of Na, Cr, Ni, and Zn in J1124+4535 show a significant departure from the general trends of the Galactic halo but are in good agreement with those of dwarf galaxies. The chemical abundances and kinematics of J1124+4535 suggest it was formed in the late stage of star formation in a dwarf galaxy that has been disrupted by the Milky Way. The star formation of its progenitor dwarf galaxy lasted more than 2 Gyr and has been affected by a rare r-process event before the occurrence of accretion event.

We report on the orbit of the binary system powering the most extreme ultraluminous X-ray pulsar known to date: NGC 5907 ULX-1 (hereafter ULX1). ULX1 has been the target of a substantial multi-instrument campaign, mainly in the X-ray band, but no clear counterparts are known in other bands. Although ULX1 is highly variable and pulsations can be transient (regardless of the source flux), the timing data collected so far allow us to investigate the orbit of this system. We find an orbital period and a projected semi-axis . The most likely ephemeris is Porb = 5.6585(6) days, A1 = 3.1(4) lt-s, and the epoch of ascending nodes passage is Tasc = 57751.37(5) MJD. However, there are six similar solutions acceptable within 3σ. We find further indications that ULX1 is a high-mass X-ray binary. This implies that we are observing its orbit face on, with an inclination <5°.

<title>Morphological Evolution of Disk Galaxies and Their Concentration, Asymmetry, and Clumpiness (CAS) Properties in Simulations across Toomre’s Q Parameter</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the morphological and structural evolution of disk galaxies in simulations for a wide range of Toomre’s Q parameters. In addition to the inspection of conventional bar modes, we compute the concentration, asymmetry, and clumpiness (CAS) parameters to enlarge the understanding of the galaxy evolution. These parameters are widely employed to analyze the light distribution of the observed galaxies, but the adaptation to numerical simulations is not much considered. While the bar formation takes place in a considerable range of Q around 1, barred galaxies originating from Q > 1 and Q < 1 disks yield CAS values that differ significantly. Disks starting with Q < 1 develop clumps due to local gravitational instabilities along with the bar, and these clumps play a central role in enhancing the CAS values. This process is absent in the Q > 1 counterparts in which the evolution is dominated by linearly unstable two-armed modes that lead to lower CAS values. Likewise, unbarred galaxies that are obtainable from disks with Q far below and far above 1 exhibit greatly different CAS magnitudes. It turns out that the CAS parameters can serve as indicators of the initial kinematical state and the evolution history of a disk of any morphology. In addition, we find an alternative mechanism of the formation of the lopsided barred galaxy when Q ≲ 1. Bars that evolve in the midst of the clumps can spontaneously become lopsided at the end.

<div> Parker Solar Probe, observations, reconnection exhausts, current sheets, plasma

总结:<br />
Parker Solar Probe在接触4-11期间分析了极径小于0.26天文单位的观测数据，发现在当前表面（current sheets, CSs）中存在重新连接排气。这些重新连接排气在各种径向距离上几乎都有相同的概率出现，但在典型的慢速风区具有Tp < 0.80 MK的平静等离子体中更为常见。高Tp > 0.80 MK的快速风区中很少支持重新连接排气现象。观测还显示了在几个CSs中存在的局部温度梯度，其中局部闭合磁场线上的高Tp等离子体和局部开放磁场线上的低Tp等离子体为一种交换型重新连接。CS的几何形状分析直接支持了X线平分磁场旋转θ角的性质，无论磁场和等离子体是否对称，以最大化重新连接速率和可用磁能量。CS正常宽度dcs的分布表明，通过分层分叉CS的嵌套层次多尺度重新连接过程可能是观察到的中位数dcs ∼ 1000 km之上的幂律分布的导致原因，而在此中位数以下的离子动能耗散尺度则存在指数型dcs分布。磁场剪切θ角在极径小于0.26天文单位和1天文单位时基本相同，中位数在太阳附近是θ ∼ 55°，而在1天文单位附近是θ ∼ 65°。相比之下，切向流剪切分布在太阳附近和远离太阳的地方是不同的。在太阳附近存在双峰切向流剪切角分布，有较强的切向流剪切角大小。这种分布会随着径向距离的增加而改变，变成了相对平坦的较弱的流切向流剪切角的分布。 <div>
Parker Solar Probe observations are analyzed for the presence of reconnection exhausts across current sheets (CSs) within R < 0.26 au during encounters 4–11. Exhausts are observed with nearly equal probability at all radial distances with a preference for quiescent Tp < 0.80 MK plasmas typical of a slow-wind regime. High Tp > 0.80 MK plasmas of a fast wind characterized by significant transverse fluctuations rarely support exhausts irrespective of the CS width. Exhaust observations demonstrate the presence of local temperature gradients across several CSs with a higher-Tp plasma on locally closed fields and a lower-Tp plasma on locally open field lines for an interchange-type reconnection. A CS geometry analysis directly supports the property that X-lines bisect the magnetic field rotation θ-angle, whether the fields and plasmas are asymmetric or not, to maximize reconnection rates and available magnetic energy. The CS normal width dcs distributions suggest that a multiscale reconnection process through nested layers of bifurcated CSs may be responsible for observed power-law distributions beyond the median dcs ∼ 1000 km with an exponential dcs distribution present for ion kinetic dissipation scales below this median. Magnetic field shear θ-angles are essentially identical at R < 0.26 and 1 au with medians at θ ∼ 55° near the Sun and θ ∼ 65° at 1 au. In contrast, the tangential flow shear distributions are different near and far from the Sun. A bimodal flow shear angle distribution is present near the Sun with strong shear flow magnitudes. This distribution is modified with radial distance toward a relatively flat distribution of weaker flow shear magnitudes.

总结:
最近的IXPE观测支持了激波模型对X射线发射的解释，但报告了与激波模型先前理论预期相比较低的极化程度。通过重新考虑激波产生的磁场在不同方向上的分布，可以描述射流中X射线和无线电发射的极化特性，并发现在低频发射中磁场的贡献显著。同时，理赫特迈尔—梅施科夫不稳定性产生的磁场对低频发射的极化特性可能有显著影响。 <div>
Recent Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observations of blazars tend to support the shock model for the X-ray emission, but report a low degree of polarization (Π ∼ 10%) in X-rays compared with the previous theoretical expectations in the shock model. In order to reconcile the theoretical expectations with observations, we revisit the polarization of the shock emission by considering different types of directions in the distribution of the shock-generated magnetic fields (sgMFs). Here, with along the shock normal direction is used to describe the direction in the distribution of sgMFs in the shock comoving frame. It is found that the polarization in the X-ray and radio emission for a general jet in blazars can be described as and , respectively. Correspondingly, one can have ζsg ∼ 1−1.5 according to IXPE observations. Besides the sgMFs, the magnetic fields generated by the Richtmyer–Meshkov instability (RMI) (rmMFs) are supposed to be present in the jets. The direction of the rmMFs is mainly distributed along the shock normal in the simulations and thus is adopted to describe the direction of the distribution in rmMFs. We find that rmMFs are likely to significantly affect the polarization properties at low-frequency emission, especially when the sgMFs decay rapidly. Based on contemporaneous radio and X-ray observations, we find that the emission of electrons in rmMFs makes a significant contribution to the low-frequency emission and the ordered background magnetic fields can be neglected.

NGC 4138是一个低光度活动星系核(AGN)宿主，研究了其内部的PAH辐射发射。研究发现，星系内的PAH带比值随半径变化显著。使用新的PAH光谱模型，研究了AGN对PAH颗粒大小分布的影响。独立模拟了NGC 4138内部辐射场的变化，并用模型预测了PAH发射光谱的相关变化。结果表明，星火环中的星光混合度对PAH带比值的趋势有显著影响，辐射模型预测了这些趋势的形状。AGN的小颗粒截断和PAH电离分数的变化可能解释了较短波段的行为，但无法解释较长波段的情况。另外，研究发现在离中心约270pc的地方，PAH带比值略有增加，这表明AGN可能直接影响该区域的PAH发射。<br /><br /> <div>
We present a focused study of radially resolved varying PAH emission in the low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN)-host NGC 4138 using deep Spitzer/infrared spectrograph spectral maps. Using new model PAH spectra, we investigate whether these variations could be associated with changes to the PAH grain size distribution due to photodestruction by the AGN. Separately, we model the effects of the varying radiation field within NGC 4138, and we use this model to predict the corresponding changes in the PAH emission spectrum. We find that PAH band ratios are strongly variable with radius in this galaxy with short-to-long wavelength band ratios peaking in the starburst ring. The changing mix of starlight appears to have a considerable effect on the trends in these band ratios, and our radiation model predicts the shapes of these trends. However, the amplitude of observed variation is ∼2.5 × larger than predicted for some ratios. A cutoff of small grains in the PAH size distribution, as has been suggested for AGN, together with changes in PAH ionization fraction could explain the behavior of the shorter bands, but this model fails to reproduce longer band behaviors. Additionally, we find that short-to-long wavelength PAH band ratios increase slightly within ∼270 pc of the center, suggesting that the AGN may directly influence PAH emission there.

总结: 
研究以美国超长基线阵列（VLBA）观测的夸萨尔1604+159为对象，对其视差尺度下的总强度、谱指数、线偏振和旋转测度分布进行了分析。在2002年以5.0、8.4和15.4 GHz和2020年以4.6、5.1、6.0、7.8、12.2、15.2和43.9 GHz进行了观测。研究发现了核心-喷流结构，喷流延伸至距核心约25mas的范围。通过线偏振分布，将源结构划分为中央区和喷流区，发现喷流区的线偏振随时间变化。核心偏移指数kr表明核心在2002年接近均衡状态，而2020年已偏离。在核心检测到了横向RM梯度，为螺旋磁场的证据。通过15 GHz观测，发现RM随频率呈幂律增加，表明介质中的快速电子密度下降。总体而言，该研究对夸萨尔1604+159的磁场结构和偏振变化进行了全面的研究。 <div>
We have analyzed the total intensity, spectral index, linear polarization, and rotation measure (RM) distributions at the parsec scale for the quasar 1604+159. The source was observed at 5.0, 8.4, and 15.4 GHz in 2002 and 4.6, 5.1, 6.0, 7.8, 12.2, 15.2, and 43.9 GHz in 2020 with the American Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). Combining the polarization results of Monitoring of Jets in Active Galactic Nuclei with VLBA Experiments at 15 GHz from 2009 to 2013, we studied the evolution of magnetic field at the parsec scale for the source. We detected a core-jet structure. The jet extends to the distance of ∼25 mas from the core at a direction of ∼66° north by east. The shape of the jet derived from 15 GHz data varies slightly with time and could be described by a straight line. Based on the linear polarization distribution in 2002, we divided the source structure into the central region and the jet region. In the jet region, we find the polarized emission varies with time. The flatter spectral index values and electric vector position angle direction indicate the possible existence of shocks, contributing to the variation of polarization in the jet with time. In the central region, the derived core shift index kr values indicate that the core in 2002 is close to the equipartition case, while it deviated from the case in 2020. The measured magnetic field strength in 2020 is 2 orders of magnitude lower than that in 2002. We detected transverse RM gradients, evidence of a helical magnetic field, in the core. The polarized emission orients in general toward the jet direction in the core. At 15 GHz, in the place close to the jet base, the polarization direction changes significantly with time from perpendicular to parallel to the jet direction. The evolution of RM and magnetic field structure are potential reasons for the observed polarization change. The core ∣RM∣ in 2020 increases with frequency following a power law with index a = 2.7 ± 0.5, suggesting a fast electron density falloff in the medium with distance from the jet base.

<br />总结:<br />这篇文章报道了对明亮的Iax型超新星SN 2020udy的光学观测和分析。研究发现，SN 2020udy的光变曲线的演变类似于其他明亮的Iax型超新星。分析模型表明，爆炸过程中合成了0.08 ± 0.01 M⊙的56Ni。其光谱特征与Iax型超新星的其他明亮成员相似，呈现出弱的Si ii线。随着时间的推移，铁族元素成为光谱中的主要特征。对SN 2020udy的光谱进行了丰度层析建模，发现外部喷发物中存在分层结构。在最大光度后，化学元素的均匀混合足以解释光谱演化。与普通Ia型超新星不同，光球逼近法在+100天之前仍然保持稳健，需要额外的连续光源。总的来说，SN 2020udy的观测特征与碳氧白矮星的爆炸一致。 <div>
We present optical observations and analysis of the bright type Iax supernova SN 2020udy hosted by NGC 0812. The evolution of the light curve of SN 2020udy is similar to that of other bright type Iax SNe. Analytical modeling of the quasi-bolometric light curves of SN 2020udy suggests that 0.08 ± 0.01 M⊙ of 56Ni would have been synthesized during the explosion. The spectral features of SN 2020udy are similar to those of the bright members of type Iax class, showing a weak Si ii line. The late-time spectral sequence is mostly dominated by iron group elements with broad emission lines. Abundance tomography modeling of the spectral time series of SN 2020udy using TARDIS indicates stratification in the outer ejecta; however, to confirm this, spectral modeling at a very early phase is required. After maximum light, uniform mixing of chemical elements is sufficient to explain the spectral evolution. Unlike in the case of normal type Ia SNe, the photospheric approximation remains robust until +100 days, requiring an additional continuum source. Overall, the observational features of SN 2020udy are consistent with the deflagration of a carbon–oxygen white dwarf.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究通过对Fermi伽马射线暴监测到的具有红移的GRB的能量、光度、等待时间和持续时间分布进行研究，首次考虑了选择效应。研究讨论了结果与SOC理论框架的兼容性，并发现能量和光度分布模型中存在内在的幂律断裂。这些发现有助于解析GRB引擎释放能量的规律，为解决GRB物理中最困惑的问题提供了重要线索。 <div>
Discovered more than 50 years ago, gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission remains the most puzzling aspect of GRB physics. Its complex and irregular nature should reveal how newborn GRB engines release their energy. In this respect, the possibility that GRB engines could operate as self-organized critical (SOC) systems has been put forward. Here, we present the energy, luminosity, waiting time, and duration distributions of individual pulses of GRBs with known redshift detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor. This is the first study of this kind in which selection effects are accounted for. The compatibility of our results with the framework of SOC theory is discussed. We found evidence for an intrinsic break in the power-law models that describe the energy and the luminosity distributions.

<div> 关键词: 磁重联, 湍流, 等离子体, 能量转换, 太空飞船
总结: 
本研究利用磁层多尺度太空飞船获取的高分辨率数据，直接证明了湍流在促进磁重联过程中起着重要作用。我们发现湍流的强度对能量转换具有显著影响，较强的湍流会产生更一致的具有较小空间尺度的结构，这些结构对磁重联过程中的能量转换至关重要。然而，我们发现湍流对粒子加热影响不大，但会影响这两个事件中离子的整体动能。这些发现显著推进了我们对天体物理等离子体中湍流和重联关系的理解。 <br /><br /> <div>
Magnetic reconnection and turbulence are two of the most significant mechanisms for energy dissipation in collisionless plasma. The role of turbulence in magnetic reconnection poses an outstanding problem in astrophysics and plasma physics. It is still unclear whether turbulence can modify the reconnection process by enhancing the reconnection rate or energy conversion rate. In this study, utilizing unprecedented high-resolution data obtained from the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft, we provide direct evidence that turbulence plays a vital role in promoting energy conversion during reconnection. We reached this conclusion by comparing magnetotail reconnection events with similar inflow Alfvén speed and plasma β but varying amplitudes of turbulence. The disparity in energy conversion was attributed to the strength of turbulence. Stronger turbulence generates more coherent structures with smaller spatial scales, which are pivotal contributors to energy conversion during reconnection. However, we find that turbulence has negligible impact on particle heating, but it does affect the ion bulk kinetic energy in these two events. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the relationship between turbulence and reconnection in astrophysical plasmas.

<div> NIR spectroscopy, HD 200775, forbidden lines, disk winds, high-resolution<br />
总结:<br />
本研究使用高分辨率近红外（NIR）光谱对HD 200775进行了分析，发现了八条禁线，其中包括[S ii]、[N i]和[Fe ii]等元素的禁线。研究表明这些禁线可以作为盘风迹象的有力指标，尤其是[N i]线可以用于推导盘风气体的基本物理参数。研究结论具有重要意义，但是对这些禁线的研究仅限于一颗天体，因此需要进一步的研究来验证其性质。 <div>
In this study, we performed high-resolution near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy (R = 28,000; λ = 0.90–1.35 μm) with a high signal-to-noise ratio on HD 200775, a very young (∼0.1 Myr old) and massive intermediate-mass star (a binary star with a mass of about 10 M⊙ each) with a protoplanetary disk. The obtained spectra show eight forbidden lines of three elements: two of [S ii] (10289 and 10323 Å), two of [N i] (10400 and 10410 Å), and four of [Fe ii] (12570, 12946, 12981, and 13209 Å). This is the first time that the [N i] lines are detected in a young stellar object with a doublet deblended. Gaussian fitting of the spectra indicates that all line profiles have low-velocity components and exhibit blueshifted features, suggesting that all lines originate from the disk winds (magnetohydrodynamic disk wind and/or photoevaporative wind). Based on the fit, the [N i] and [Fe ii] lines are categorized into narrow components, while the [S ii] lines are at the boundary between broad and narrow components. These forbidden lines are suggested to be very promising disk wind tracers among the existing ones because they are in the NIR-wavelength range, which can be observed from early stages with high sensitivities. Among these lines, [N i] lines would be a rather powerful probe for deriving the basic physical parameters of disk wind gases. However, the study of these lines herein is limited to one object; thus, further studies are needed to examine their properties.

这项研究更新了包括1092个6.7 GHz甲醇激射源的目录。此外，利用上海天马射电望远镜观测了214个星形成区域的NH3 (1, 1), NH3 (2, 2), 和 NH3 (3, 3)跃迁，以检验与银河尺度上甲醇激射源相关的分子云的激发温度和柱密度等物理环境的差异。统计结果表明，Perseus臂中的6.7 GHz甲醇激射源数量明显低于其他三个主要螺旋臂。此外，Perseus臂的气体柱密度也是NH3观测到的主要螺旋臂中最低的。这两点发现表明，与其他三个主要螺旋臂相比，Perseus臂的高质量恒星形成速率最低。我们还观测到一个趋势，即6.7 GHz甲醇激射源的亮度和氨气柱密度均随着银心距的增加而下降。这一发现表明，银河系内部的物质密度通常比外部高，进一步暗示在螺旋臂的前端更容易形成高质量恒星。此外，我们发现螺旋臂区域中氨气的柱密度高于螺旋臂间区域，支持前者更可能是高质量恒星的诞生地。<br /><br />总结: 该研究更新了6.7 GHz甲醇激射源目录，并观测了NH3跃迁，发现Perseus臂中的6.7 GHz甲醇激射源数量较低，气体柱密度也最低，提示该区域的高质量恒星形成速率低。研究还表明在银心距增加时，银河系内部的物质密度更高，高质量恒星更容易形成，并且螺旋臂区域中氨气的柱密度更高，更可能是高质量恒星的诞生地。 <div>
An updated catalog consisting of 1092 6.7 GHz methanol maser sources is reported in this work. Additionally, the NH3 (1, 1), NH3 (2, 2), and NH3 (3, 3) transitions were observed toward 214 star-forming regions using the Shanghai Tianma radio telescope in order to examine the differences in physical environments, such as the excitation temperature and column density of molecular clouds associated with methanol masers on the Galactic scale. Statistical results reveal that the number of 6.7 GHz methanol masers in the Perseus arm is significantly lower than that in the other three main spiral arms. In addition, the Perseus arm also has the lowest gas column density among the main spiral arms traced by the NH3 observations. Both findings suggest that the Perseus arm has the lowest rate of high-mass star formation compared to the other three main spiral arms. We also observed a trend in which both the luminosity of the 6.7 GHz methanol masers and the ammonia gas column density decreased with the galactocentric distance. This finding indicates that the density of material in the inner Milky Way is generally higher than that in the outer Milky Way. This further suggests that high-mass stars are more easily formed at the head of the spiral arms. Furthermore, we found that the column density of ammonia gas is higher in the regions on the arms than in the inter-arm regions, supporting that the former is more likely to be the birthplace of high-mass stars.

<br /><br />总结:
GRS 1734-292是一个无线安静的星系，既没有剧烈的星暴活动，也没有喷流活动。然而，费米探测到了这个星系在GeV波段的活动。通过ALMA的观测，证实了在星系中心约100光年范围内存在毫米过剩，并且这种过剩还具有时间变化。根据观测结果，研究人员认为这种活动可能源自于核心区域小于100个Schwarzschild半径的紧凑源上的辐射活动。未来更高分辨率的毫米波观测将有助于进一步揭示这一现象的真相，为我们提供了解活动星系核中高能粒子加速位置的重要线索。 <div>
GRS 1734-292 is a radio-quiet galaxy, exhibiting neither intense starburst nor jet activities. However, Fermi-LAT detected this object in the GeV band. The origin of nonthermal activity in this Seyfert galaxy is an intriguing question. We report Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of GRS 1734-292 at frequencies of 97.5, 145, and 225 GHz. These observations confirmed the millimeter excess within the central ⪅100 pc region and its time variability based on two separate observations conducted 4 days apart. The timescale of variability aligns with the light-crossing time for a compact source smaller than <100 Schwarzschild radius. If we take into account the power-law synchrotron emission originating from the corona (i.e., the hot plasma located above the accretion disk), the millimeter spectrum indicates the coronal magnetic field of ≈10 G and the size of ≈10 Schwarzschild radius. An alternative explanation for this millimeter emission could be synchrotron and free–free emission from disk winds (i.e., fast wide-opening angle outflows from the disk) with the size of ≈10 pc, although it may be difficult to explain the fast variability. Future millimeter observations with higher resolution (<0.″01) will enable the differentiation between these two scenarios. Such observations will provide insights into the acceleration sites of high-energy particles at the core of active galactic nuclei.

Drawing from the Chandra archive and using a carefully selected set of nearby dwarf galaxies, we present a calibrated high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) luminosity function in the low-mass galaxy regime and search for an already hinted at dependence on metallicity. Our study introduces a new sample of local dwarf galaxies (D < 12.5 Mpc and M* < 5 × 109M⊙), expanding the specific star formation rates (sSFR) and gas-phase metallicities probed in previous investigations. Our analysis of the observed X-ray luminosity function indicates a shallower power-law slope for the dwarf galaxy HMXB population. In our study, we focus on dwarf galaxies that are more representative in terms of sSFR compared to prior work. In this regime, the HMXB luminosity function exhibits significant stochastic sampling at high luminosities. This likely accounts for the pronounced scatter observed in the galaxy-integrated HMXB population’s LX/SFR versus metallicity for our galaxy sample. Our calibration is necessary to understand the active galactic nuclei content of low-mass galaxies identified in current and future X-ray survey fields and has implications for binary population synthesis models, as well as X-ray-driven cosmic heating in the early Universe.

反射光谱的计算模型考虑了返回辐射的影响，能够对Kerr时空中的薄吸积盘进行准确计算。通过使用真实入射辐射的光谱，该模型在吸积盘上每个点都能计算出反射光谱。使用lamppost冠状结构进行模拟观测，我们发现在黑洞自转参数极高、冠状高度和盘的电离参数低时，带有返回辐射的relxill模型无法很好地拟合模拟数据，某些参数可能被显著高估或低估。随着黑洞自转参数值的降低和冠状高度的增加，我们能够得到更好的拟合，并恢复出正确的输入参数数值。

<br /><br />总结: 本研究提出了一个新的模型来计算Kerr时空中薄吸积盘的反射光谱，考虑了返回辐射的影响。模拟观测表明，在一些特定参数范围内，现有模型无法很好地拟合数据，但可以在更低的自转参数和更高的冠状高度下得到更好的拟合结果和正确的参数恢复。 <div>
We present a new model to calculate reflection spectra of thin accretion disks in Kerr spacetimes. Our model includes the effect of returning radiation, which is the radiation that is emitted by the disk and returns to the disk because of the strong light bending near a black hole. The major improvement with respect to the existing models is that it calculates the reflection spectrum at every point on the disk by using the actual spectrum of the incident radiation. Assuming a lamppost coronal geometry, we simulate simultaneous observations of NICER and NuSTAR of bright Galactic black holes and we fit the simulated data with the latest version of relxill (modified to read the table of reflionx, which is the nonrelativistic reflection model used in our calculations). We find that relxill with returning radiation cannot fit well the simulated data when the black hole spin parameter is very high and the coronal height and disk’s ionization parameter are low, and some parameters can be significantly overestimated or underestimated. We can find better fits and recover the correct input parameters as the value of the black hole spin parameter decreases and the value of the coronal height increases.

We present a timing solution for the 5.31 ms spider millisecond pulsar (MSP) J1242−4712, discovered with the GMRT. PSR J1242−4712 orbits a companion of minimum mass 0.08 M⊙ with an orbital period of 7.7 hr and occupies a relatively unexplored region in the orbital period versus companion mass space. We did not detect gamma-ray pulsations for this MSP, and also could not identify the optical counterpart for PSR J1242–4712 in available optical/near-infrared data. The profile of J1242−4712 evolves with frequency, showing a clear single component at lower frequencies and a three-component profile at 650 MHz. PSR J1242−4712 eclipses for a very short duration near superior conjunction (orbital phase ∼ 0.23−0.25) below 360 MHz. Moreover, significant dispersion measure delays and errors in the pulse times of arrivals are observed near inferior conjunction (orbital phase ∼ 0.7), along with an observed eclipse in one epoch at 650 MHz. Observed eclipses and significant orbital period variability suggest that PSR J1242−4712 is possibly not a helium star−white dwarf binary, but has a semi- or nondegenerate companion, indicating that this is a “spider” MSP lying in a region between typical black widows and redbacks. This system may represent a distinct category of spider MSPs, displaying characteristics that bridge the gap between known black widow and redback MSPs.

<title>Identifying Plasma Fractionation Processes in the Chromosphere Using IRIS</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The composition of the solar corona differs from that of the photosphere, with the plasma thought to fractionate in the solar chromosphere according to the first ionization potential (FIP) of the different elements. This produces a FIP bias, wherein elements with a low FIP are preferentially enhanced in the corona compared to their photospheric abundance, but direct observations of this process remain elusive. Here, we use a series of spectroscopic observations of active region AR 12759 as it transited the solar disk over a period of 6 days from 2020 April 2–7 taken using the Hinode Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer and Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) instruments to look for signatures of plasma fractionation in the solar chromosphere. Using the Si x/S x and Ca xiv/Ar xiv diagnostics, we find distinct differences between the FIP bias of the leading and following polarities of the active region. The widths of the IRIS Si iv lines exhibited clear differences between the leading and following polarity regions, indicating increased unresolved wave activity in the following polarity region compared to the leading polarity region, with the chromospheric velocities derived using the Mg ii lines exhibiting comparable, albeit much weaker, behavior. These results are consistent with plasma fractionation via resonant/nonresonant waves at different locations in the solar chromosphere following the ponderomotive force model, and indicate that IRIS could be used to further study this fundamental physical process.

<title>Visit Nearby Halo Substructures Using LAMOST DR9 MRS Data</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Based on the LAMOST DR9 Medium Resolution Spectra (MRS) catalog, combined with astrometries from Gaia DR3, we conducted an investigation into the substructures in the stellar halo to obtain their chemical and kinematic information. We employed the HDBSCAN algorithm in the (Lz, E, Lxy) space for clustering and utilized Mahalanobis distance to merge the clustering results. Ultimately, within the LAMOST DR9 MRS catalog, we identified members of Gaia–Sausage–Enceladus (GSE), Helmi streams, and the high-α disk and in situ halo. Additionally, there are three clusters that cannot be correlated with known substructures. Based on their angular momentum (Lz) characteristics, we have tentatively named two of them High-Lz-Cluster-1 (HLC-1) and High-Lz-Cluster-2 (HLC-2), both exhibiting high angular momentum (Lz) features. The third cluster, owing to its extremely low Lz, is termed the Low-Lz-Cluster. Then detailed analysis about those substructures are executed including member stars’ identification and kinematic and chemical distribution. The resulting GSE member stars exhibit a well-defined metallicity distribution function with its peak at [Fe/H] ∼ −1.2, consistent with previous findings, and we found there appear to be some differences in the distribution on the Vtotal–rgal plane between GSE and its included Splash component. Regarding Helmi streams, in the [Mg/Fe]–[Fe/H] plane we detected potential traces of the α-knee phenomenon at [Fe/H] ∼ −1.53. Finally, we tentatively provide the possible origin for the HLC-1 and HLC-2.

<title>Parallel Diffusion Coefficient of Energetic Charged Particles in the Inner Heliosphere from the Turbulent Magnetic Fields Measured by Parker Solar Probe</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Diffusion coefficients of energetic charged particles in turbulent magnetic fields are a fundamental aspect of diffusive transport theory but remain incompletely understood. In this work, we use quasi-linear theory to evaluate the spatial variation of the parallel diffusion coefficient κ∥ from the measured magnetic turbulence power spectra in the inner heliosphere. We consider the magnetic field and plasma velocity measurements from Parker Solar Probe made during Orbits 5–13. The parallel diffusion coefficient is calculated as a function of radial distance from 0.062 to 0.8 au, and the particle energy from 100 keV to 1 GeV. We find that κ∥ increases exponentially with both heliocentric distance and energy of particles. The fluctuations in κ∥ are related to the episodes of large-scale magnetic structures in the solar wind. By fitting the results, we also provide an empirical formula of κ∥ = (5.16 ± 1.22) × 1018r1.17±0.08E0.71±0.02 (cm2 s−1) in the inner heliosphere, which can be used as a reference in studying the transport and acceleration of solar energetic particles as well as the modulation of cosmic rays.

<title>Suppression of Star Formation in Galaxy Pairs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the suppression of star formation in galaxy pairs based on the isolated galaxy pair sample derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey survey. By comparing the star formation rate between late-type galaxies (LTGs) in galaxy pairs and those in the isolated environment, we detect a signal of the suppression of star formation in galaxy pairs at dp < 100 kpc and 200 kpc < dp < 350 kpc. The occurrence of the suppression of star formation in these LTGs requires their companion galaxies to have an early-type morphology (ns > 2.5). The suppression of star formation in wide galaxy pairs at 200 kpc < dp < 350 kpc mainly occurs in massive LTGs, while in close galaxy pairs at dp < 100 kpc, it only appears in LTGs with a massive companion ( ), nearly independent of their own stellar mass. Based on these findings, we infer that the suppression of star formation in wide galaxy pairs is actually a result of galaxy conformity, while in close galaxy pairs, it stems from the influence of hot circumgalactic medium surrounding companion galaxies.

<title>Resonant Absorption of Magnetohydrodynamic Body Modes under Photospheric Conditions</title>

Observations reveal that surface and body modes exist in solar pores under photospheric conditions. While the effects of resonant absorption on photospheric surface modes are well established, its effect on body modes is not known yet. In this paper, we investigate resonant absorption for the body modes under photospheric conditions. We numerically solve the dispersion relation induced by thin boundary approximation and obtain the wave dispersion curves and damping rates of three arbitrarily chosen body modes for sausage and kink waves, respectively. The results show that resonant absorption for the body modes is weaker than for the slow surface modes in both cusp and Alfvén continua. The damping behavior of body modes is similar to slow surface modes while the higher body mode has stronger resonant absorption.

<title>Study of Magnetic Field and Turbulence in the TeV Halo around the Monogem Pulsar</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Magnetic fields are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium, including extended objects such as supernova remnants and diffuse halos around pulsars. Its turbulent characteristics govern the diffusion of cosmic rays and the multiwavelength emission from pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). However, the geometry and turbulence nature of the magnetic fields in the ambient region of PWN is still unknown. Recent gamma-ray observations from HAWC and synchrotron observations suggest a highly suppressed diffusion coefficient compared to the mean interstellar value. In this study, we present the first direct observational evidence of the orientation of the mean magnetic field and turbulent characteristics by employing a recently developed statistical parameter “Yturb” in the extended halo around the Monogem pulsar. Our study points to two possible scenarios: nearly aligned toward the line of sight (LOS) with compressible modes dominance or high inclination angle toward the LOS and characterized by Alfvénic turbulence. The first scenario appears consistent with other observational signatures. Furthermore, we report that the magnetic field has an observed correlation length of approximately 3 ± 0.6 pc in the Monogem halo. Our study highlights the pivotal role of magnetic field and turbulence in unraveling the physical processes in TeV halos and cosmic-ray transport.

<div> Ryugu, asteroid, aqueous alteration age, Mn-Cr method, solar system evolution
总结:<br />
研究使用Mn-Cr方法测定了龙宫粒子的水改造年龄，得出了形成Ca-Al富集体(CAI)后4.13 + 0.62/−0.55百万年的年龄。这个年龄相当于4563.17 + 0.60/−0.67百万年前。龙宫样本的55Mn/52Cr，ε54Cr和初始ε53Cr值高于任何碳质球粒陨石样本，暗示其母本体是由原始盘的外部区域最少热加工的前体物质形成。尽管龙宫等含水小行星与太阳的距离不同，它们在有限的时间内（在CAI之后的3.8±1.8百万年）经历了水改造。这些年龄与碳质无球粒陨石NWA 6704/6693的结晶年龄误差相同。龙宫和NWA 6704/6693的ε54Cr和初始ε53Cr值相同，但它们显示出不同的Δ'17O值。这表明形成龙宫和NWA 6703/6693母体的前体物质是在原始太阳星盘中的相邻位置形成，并经历了类似程度的热加工，但龙宫的母本体由较高的冰/尘埃比率在原始星盘的外部区域形成。 <div>
The analysis of samples returned from the C-type asteroid Ryugu has drastically advanced our knowledge of the evolution of early solar system materials. However, no consensus has been obtained on the chronological data, which is important for understanding the evolution of the asteroid Ryugu. Here, the aqueous alteration age of Ryugu particles was determined by the Mn–Cr method using bulk samples, yielding an age of 4.13 + 0.62/−0.55 Myr after the formation of Ca–Al-rich inclusions (CAI). The age corresponds to 4563.17 + 0.60/−0.67 Myr ago. The higher 55Mn/52Cr, ε54Cr, and initial ε53Cr values of the Ryugu samples relative to any carbonaceous chondrite samples implies that its progenitor body formed from the least thermally processed precursors in the outermost region of the protoplanetary disk. Despite accreting at different distances from the Sun, the hydrous asteroids (Ryugu and the parent bodies of CI, CM, CR, and ungrouped C2 meteorites) underwent aqueous alteration during a period of limited duration (3.8 ± 1.8 Myr after CAI). These ages are identical to the crystallization age of the carbonaceous achondirtes NWA 6704/6693 within the error. The ε54Cr and initial ε53Cr values of Ryugu and NWA 6704/6693 are also identical, while they show distinct Δ'17O values. This suggests that the precursors that formed the progenitor bodies of Ryugu and NWA 6703/6693 were formed in close proximity and experienced a similar degree of thermal processing in the protosolar nebula. However, the progenitor body of Ryugu was formed by a higher ice/dust ratio, than NWA6703/6693, in the outer region of the protoplanetary disk.

Parker Solar Probe在2022年2月27日和28日观察到了一个小的分散事件，表明在低日冕和35个太阳半径以上之间，无散射传播是主要的传输机制。该事件发生在PSP遇到过多次的特定通量管沿特定轨道条件下。PSP轨道的这一部分相对于旋转的太阳表面具有几乎静止的角运动，使得PSP的运动在旋转参考系中基本呈径向运动。这一事件的时间离散通常出现在脉冲太阳能粒子事件中，并且速度包括核心太阳风离子的速度。特别是在事件开始时，3He含量远大于通常在∼100keV到数MeV的能量范围内观察到的氦的太阳能粒子丰度。事件后期，铁增加。组成特征表明这是一个加速机制的例子，用于在SEP事件中产生所需的种子能粒子，以解释这些事件中各种物种的富集高于太阳丰度。对PSP任务中类似轨道条件的初步搜索尚未发现其他类似事件，尽管所需的有利条件（孤立的脉冲加速和与最小磁场波动的良好有序磁场连接）很少实现，鉴于满足这些观测条件的PSP轨迹的小部分。 <br /><br />总结: Parker Solar Probe在2022年2月观察到了一个小的分散事件，揭示了无散射传播作为主要传输机制。通过特定轨道条件，该事件提供了关于脉冲太阳能粒子事件的时间离散以及关于氦和铁等成分的重要信息。这对于理解SEP事件中的加速机制具有重要意义，而在PSP任务中类似的轨道条件较少发现。 <div>
Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations of a small dispersive event on 2022 February 27 and 28 indicate scatter-free propagation as the dominant transport mechanism between the low corona and greater than 35 solar radii. The event occurred during unique orbital conditions that prevailed along specific flux tubes that PSP encountered repeatedly between 25 and 35 Rs during outbound orbit 11. This segment of the PSP orbit exhibits almost stationary angular motion relative to the rotating solar surface, such that in the rotating frame, PSP’s motion is essentially radial. The time dispersion often observed in impulsive solar energetic particle (SEP) events continues in this case down to velocities including the core solar-wind ion velocities. Especially at the onset of this event, the 3He content is much larger than the usual SEP abundances seen in the energy range from ∼100 keV to several MeV for helium. Later in the event, iron is enhanced. The compositional signatures suggest this to be an example of an acceleration mechanism for generating the seed energetic particles required by shock (or compression) acceleration models in SEP events to account for the enrichment of various species above solar abundances in such events. A preliminary search of similar orbital conditions over the PSP mission has not revealed additional such events, although favorable conditions (isolated impulsive acceleration and well-ordered magnetic field connection with minimal magnetic field fluctuation) that would be required are infrequently realized, given the small fraction of the PSP trajectory that meets these observation conditions.

There exist very few mid-infrared (IR) observations of supernovae (SNe) in general. Therefore, SN 1987A, the closest visible SN in 400 yr, gives us the opportunity to explore the mid-IR properties of SNe, the dust in their ejecta, and the surrounding medium and to witness the birth of an SN remnant (SNR). The James Webb Space Telescope, with its high spatial resolution and extreme sensitivity, gives a new view on these issues. We report on the first imaging observations obtained with the Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI). We build temperature maps and discuss the morphology of the nascent SNR. Our results show that the temperatures in the equatorial ring (ER) are quite nonuniform. This could be due to dust destruction in some parts of the ring, as had been assumed in some previous works. We show that the IR emission extends beyond the ER, illustrating the fact that the shock wave has now passed through this ring to affect the circumstellar medium on a larger scale. Finally, while submillimeter Atacama Large Millimeter Array observations have hinted at the location of the compact remnant of SN 1987A, we note that our MIRI data have found no such evidence.

<title>A Multiwavelength Light-curve Model of the Classical Nova V339 Del: A Mechanism for the Coexistence of Dust Dip and Supersoft X-Rays</title>

<div> 关键词: 新星V339 Del 2013, 光度曲线, 尘埃壳形成, 硬X射线, 白矮星质量<br />
总结: <br />
这篇文章讨论了2013年新发现的经典新星V339 Del的特点，该新星的V光度曲线出现1.5等星的明显下降，因为形成了一个尘埃壳，与此同时还存在着软X射线的辐射。作者提出了一个多波段光度曲线模型，成功地复现了y和V光度曲线以及伽马射线和X射线光度曲线。在模型中，光度曲线下降后出现了强烈的激波，尘埃壳的形成抑制了[O iii]的辐射，导致V光度曲线下降，之后又逐渐恢复。白矮星的质量被确定为1.25 ± 0.05 M☉，V波段的距离模数为(m − M)V = 12.2 ± 0.2；考虑到消光作用，距离为d = 2.1 ± 0.2 kpc，E(B − V) = 0.18。 <div>
The classical nova V339 Del 2013 is characterized by a 1.5 mag dip of the V light curve owing to a dust shell formation, with which soft X-ray emissions coexist. We present a Strömgren y-band light curve, which represents continuum emission, not influenced by strong [O iii] emission lines. The y light curve monotonically decreases in marked contrast to the V light curve that shows a 1.5 mag dip. We propose a multiwavelength light-curve model that reproduces the y and V light curves as well as the gamma-ray and X-ray light curves. In our model, a strong shock arises far outside the photosphere after optical maximum, because later ejected matter collides with earlier ejected gas. Our shocked shell model explains optical emission lines, Hα, hard X-ray, and gamma-ray fluxes. A dust shell forms behind the shock that suppresses [O iii]. This low flux of [O iii] shapes a 1.5 mag drop in the V light curve. Then, the V flux recovers with an increasing contribution from [O iii] lines, while the y flux does not. However, the optical depth of the dust shell is too small to absorb the photospheric (X-ray) emission of the white dwarf. This is the reason that a dust shell and soft X-ray radiation coexist. We determined the white dwarf mass to be MWD = 1.25 ± 0.05 M☉ and the distance modulus in the V band to be (m − M)V = 12.2 ± 0.2; the distance is d = 2.1 ± 0.2 kpc for the reddening of E(B − V) = 0.18.

Inertial wave modes in the Sun are of interest owing to their potential to reveal new insight into the solar interior. These predominantly retrograde-propagating modes in the solar subsurface appear to deviate from the thin-shell Rossby–Haurwitz model at high azimuthal orders. We present new measurements of sectoral inertial modes at m > 15 where the modes appear to become progressively less retrograde compared to the canonical Rossby–Haurwitz dispersion relation in a corotating frame. We use a spectral eigenvalue solver to compute the spectrum of solar inertial modes in the presence of differential rotation. Focussing specifically on equatorial Rossby modes, we find that the numerically obtained mode frequencies lie along distinct ridges, one of which lies strikingly close to the observed mode frequencies in the Sun. We also find that the n = 0 ridge is deflected strongly in the retrograde direction. This suggests that the solar measurements may not correspond to the fundamental n = 0 Rossby–Haurwitz solutions as was initially suspected, but to those for a higher n. The numerically obtained eigenfunctions also appear to sit deep within the convection zone—unlike those for the n = 0 modes—which differs substantially from solar measurements and complicates inference.

We present the results of models of impulsively heated coronal loops using the 1D hydrodynamic Adaptively Refined Godunov Solver code. The impulsive heating events (which we refer to as nanoflares) are modeled by discrete pulses of energy along the loop. We explore the occurrence of cold condensations due to the effective equivalent of thermal nonequilibrium in loops with steady heating, and examine its dependence on nanoflare timing and intensity and also nanoflare location along the loop, including randomized distributions of nanoflares. We find that randomizing the distribution of nanoflares, both in time/intensity and location, diminishes the likelihood of condensation occurring as compared to distributions with regularly occurring nanoflares with the same average properties. The usual criteria that condensation is favored for heating near loop footpoints and with high cadences are more strict for randomized (as opposed to regular) nanoflare distributions, and for randomized distributions the condensations stay in the loop for a shorter amount of time. That said, condensation can sometimes occur in cases where the average values of parameters (frequency or location) are beyond the critical limits above which condensation does not occur for corresponding steady, non-randomized values of those parameters. These properties of condensation occurring due to randomized heating can be used in the future to investigate the diagnostics of coronal heating mechanisms.

The Macquart relation describes the correlation between the dispersion measure (DM) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) and the redshift z of their host galaxies. The scatter of the Macquart relation is sensitive to the distribution of baryons in the intergalactic medium including those ejected from galactic halos through feedback processes. The variance of the distribution in DMs from the cosmic web (DMcosmic) is parameterized by a fluctuation parameter F. In this work, we present a new measurement of F using 78 FRBs of which 21 have been localized to host galaxies. Our analysis simultaneously fits for the Hubble constant H0 and the DM distribution due to the FRB host galaxy. We find that the fluctuation parameter is degenerate with these parameters, most notably H0, and use a uniform prior on H0 to measure at the 3σ confidence interval and a new constraint on the Hubble constant . Using a synthetic sample of 100 localized FRBs, the constraint on the fluctuation parameter is improved by a factor of ∼2. Comparing our F measurement to simulated predictions from cosmological simulation (IllustrisTNG), we find agreement between redshifts 0.4 < z and z < 2.0. However, at z < 0.4, the simulations underpredict F, which we attribute to the rapidly changing extragalactic DM excess distribution at low redshift.

Using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, it has been suggested that the rotational energy of a rapidly rotating black hole (BH) is preferentially extracted along the magnetic field lines threading the event horizon in the middle and lower latitudes. Applying this angle-dependent Poynting flux to the jet downstream, we demonstrate that the jets exhibit limb-brightened structures at various viewing angles, as observed from Mrk 501, M87, and Cyg A between 5° and 75°, and that the limb brightening is enhanced when the jet is collimated strongly. It is also found that the jet width perpendicular to the propagation direction shrinks at the projected distance of the altitude where the jet collimates from a conical shape (near the BH) to a parabolic one (in the jet). Comparing with Very Long Baseline Interferometry observations, we show that this collimation takes place within the deprojected altitude of 100 Schwarzschild radii from the BH in the case of the M87 jet.

<div> 关键词: 水分子，硅酸盐表面，天体物理环境，陷阱，地球形成

总结:
水分子在硅酸盐表面上的捕获现象对各种天体物理环境具有重要意义，实验结果表明，这种捕获现象取决于表面的性质和组成。硅酸盐表面的亲水性使得水分子可以被有效捕获，而捕获的性质是物理吸附而非化学吸附。此外，研究还表明，在高达470K的温度下仍然可以捕获水分子，这说明在行星形成盘中可能存在着湿润的硅酸盐颗粒。对于已捕获的水的热稳定性和紫外线稳定性的研究结果表明，在漫射的星际介质中检测到了被捕获的水分子，说明水分子有高效的持续形成。最后，研究还探讨了这些结果对一些基础科学问题的意义，比如氧的消耗问题、地球上水的起源以及岩石行星的形成。 <div>
The existence of strongly bound water molecules on silicate surfaces, above the desorption temperature of water ice, was first predicted by computational studies and has recently been demonstrated by laboratory experiments. Such trapped water may be present in various astrophysical environments and there is now evidence for its presence in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) and in extraterrestrial particles. We present here new results of a laboratory study of the phenomenon of trapping (strong bonding) of water molecules by silicates. We show that the efficiency of the trapping is strongly dependent on the properties and composition of the surface. Our results point out that the presence of trapped water should be due to the hydrophilic properties of the silicate surface and that the nature of the trapping is physical (physisorption rather than chemisorption). We demonstrate that water can be trapped on silicates up to temperatures of about 470 K, which speaks for the presence of wet silicate grains in the terrestrial planet formation zone in planet-forming disks. Studying the thermal and UV stability of trapped water, we conclude that the detection of trapped water in the diffuse ISM speaks for its efficient continuous formation. We discuss our results as relevant to fundamental scientific questions, such as the oxygen depletion problem, the origin of water on Earth, and the formation of rocky planets.

<div> Gaia Data Release 2, M dwarf gap, convective transition mass, Hα emission, Ca ii H and K activity

总结:
Gaia Data Release 2中发现了M矮星间隙现象，也称为Jao Gap，它表现为主序线上在与对流转变质量（约0.35 M⊙）附近的一小段明度范围内，星体密度减少了17%。之前的研究表明，太阳附近的恒星在Jao Gap的G亮度附近存在Hα发射的缺乏现象。作者推测，这一现象可能是由于Jao Gap特征形成和恒星辐射性转变区的破坏所导致的恒星磁拓扑的复杂变化。本研究还观察到Ca ii H和K活动与Hα在Jao Gap附近表现出类似的异常行为，活动的恒星间变化增加。研究提出了一个恒星磁场演化的玩具模型，表明这种增加可能是由于Jao Gap形成所驱动的周期混合事件引起的磁场随机破坏。 <div>
The Gaia M dwarf gap, also known as the Jao Gap, is a novel feature discovered in the Gaia Data Release 2 G versus BP-RP color–magnitude diagram. This gap represents a 17% decrease in stellar density in a thin magnitude band around the convective transition mass (∼0.35 M⊙) on the main sequence. Previous work has demonstrated a paucity of Hα emission coincident with the G magnitude of the Jao Gap in the solar neighborhood. The exact mechanism that results in this paucity is as of yet unknown; however, the authors of the originating paper suggest that it may be the result of complex variations to a star’s magnetic topology driven by the Jao Gap’s characteristic formation and breakdown of stars’ radiative transition zones. We present a follow-up investigating another widely used magnetic activity metric, Calcium ii H and K emission. Ca ii H and K activity appears to share a similar anomalous behavior as Hα does near the Jao Gap magnitude. We observe an increase in star-to-star variation of magnetic activity near the Jao Gap. We present a toy model of a star’s magnetic field evolution, which demonstrates that this increase may be due to stochastic disruptions to the magnetic field originating from the periodic-mixing events characteristic of the convective kissing instabilities that drive the formation of the Jao Gap.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了机器学习在核物质方程状态中的应用。研究者构建了一个神经网络平台，用于限制核物质状态方程的行为。他们发现神经网络可以合理预测参数空间，并为强子相互作用的限制提供新的线索。文中以相对论平均场近似为例说明了平台的可行性和效率。结果表明神经网络可以确实估计模型参数，使得核物质在饱和密度周围的性质和中子星的整体性质都可以满足。当前模块化设计的神经网络的优化和扩展到其他有效模型都是直接的。 <div>
Due to its powerful capability and high efficiency in big data analysis, machine learning has been applied in various fields. We construct a neural network platform to constrain the behaviors of the equation of state of nuclear matter with respect to the properties of nuclear matter at saturation density and the properties of neutron stars. It is found that the neural network is able to give reasonable predictions of parameter space and provide new hints into the constraints of hadron interactions. As a specific example, we take the relativistic mean field approximation in a widely accepted Walecka-type model to illustrate the feasibility and efficiency of the platform. The results show that the neural network can indeed estimate the parameters of the model at a certain precision such that both the properties of nuclear matter around saturation density and global properties of neutron stars can be saturated. The optimization of the present modularly designed neural network and extension to other effective models is straightforward.

总结: 
这篇文章报道了对X3Σ−基态的氘化分子离子SD+进行了实验室测量，并确定了其旋转、离心畸变、自旋-自旋相互作用和超精细结构常数。通过这些参数，提供了SD+的准确亚毫米波静止频率，以便在天文学上进行探测。研究人员利用Atacama大型毫米/亚毫米阵列(ALMA)对PKS 1830-211夸萨的SD+吸收线进行了调查，确定了分子吸收线的上限总柱密度为3 × 1012 cm−2。 <div>
Seven rotational and fine-structure transitions of the deuterated molecular ion SD+ in the X3Σ− ground electronic state have been measured in the 271–863 GHz region in the laboratory. This ion has been produced by direct-current glow discharge using a mixture of D2S and argon in a free space cell in a temperature range of −140°C to −160°C. The rotational, centrifugal distortion, spin–spin interaction, and hyperfine constants have been determined; the standard deviation of the residuals in the fitting is 109 kHz. The set of obtained spectroscopic parameters provides a list of accurate submillimeter rest frequencies of SD+ for astronomical detection. We have investigated lines of SD+ toward the quasar PKS 1830-211 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array archive, as the z = 0.89 molecular absorber exists in front of this quasar. A data set covering the 297 GHz region includes the NJ = 23–12 transition at 561 GHz due to redshift, providing an upper limit of the column density Ntot = 3 × 1012 cm−2 for SD+.

<div> 关键词: 小尺度场向电流, 磁层边界层, 能量耗散, 太阳风, 磁层耦合<br />
总结: <br />
这项研究利用2015年5月至2018年6月的Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS)任务的高分辨率测量数据，统计性地研究了磁层边界层中小尺度场向电流（SFACs）的性质。共成功识别了2235个SFACs，它们的持续时间主要在0.2到0.3秒之间，宽度大多小于1个离子惯性长度，主要分布在5到25个电子惯性长度之间。SFACs的主要载体是电子，超过70%的SFACs表现出净能量耗散，其中大部分能量耗散发生在平行方向。SFACs在空间上分布广泛，且在靠近磁层的边界层中发生率更高。此外，不到一半的SFACs出现在众所周知的结构中，约54%的SFACs出现在“其他”未知结构中。这些结果提高了我们对磁层边界层中电流系统和SFACs在太阳风和磁层耦合中的作用的理解。 <div>
Based on high-resolution measurements from the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission from 2015 May to 2018 June, we statistically investigate the properties of small-scale field-aligned currents (SFACs) in the magnetopause boundary layer. A total of 2235 SFACs are successfully identified. The durations of SFACs mainly fall between 0.2 and 0.3 s. Over 90% of SFACs have a width of less than 1 ion inertia length and are primarily distributed from 5 to 25 electron inertia lengths, implying that the SFACs belong to the kinetic-scale current layer. The main carriers of SFACs are electrons, and over 70% of SFACs exhibit net energy dissipation (i.e., J · E′ > 0) with the majority of energy dissipation taking place in the parallel direction. SFACs are widely distributed spatially, and the occurrence rate of SFACs is higher in the boundary layer closer to the magnetosphere. Additionally, less than half of the total SFACs are identified in well-known structures, including the magnetic reconnection region, flux transfer event, Kelvin–Helmholtz vortex, and exhaust region, and 54% of the SFACs are in the “others” unknown structures. These results improve our comprehension of the current system at the magnetopause and the roles of SFACs in the coupling between the solar wind and magnetosphere.

总结:<br />
本文详细计算了宇宙γ射线与太阳光子相互作用，产生电子-正电子对的吸收光学深度。该效应在距离太阳较近的γ射线源处最为显著，吸收光学深度可高达τγγ ∼ 10−2。文章还考虑了亚光速Lorentz不变性（LIV）对吸收截面阈值的影响，首次展示亚光速LIV可导致τγγ与非LIV情况相比增加或减少。研究表明，至少在原理上，可通过HAWC或LHAASO在≳20 TeV的能量范围内观测太阳附近γ射线源，探测LIV效应，尽管由于效应规模微小，测量将极为困难。 <div>
We compute in detail the absorption optical depth for astrophysical γ-ray photons interacting with solar photons to produce electron–positron pairs. This effect is greatest for γ-ray sources at small angular distances from the Sun, reaching optical depths as high as τγγ ∼ 10−2. We also calculate this effect including modifications to the absorption cross-section threshold from subluminal Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). We show for the first time that subluminal LIV can lead to increases or decreases in τγγ compared to the non-LIV case. We show that, at least in principle, LIV can be probed with this effect with observations of γ-ray sources near the Sun at ≳20 TeV by HAWC or LHAASO, although a measurement will be extremely difficult due to the small size of the effect.

<div> 关键词: AT2022cmc, TDE, NuSTAR, X-ray spectra, jetted tidal disruption event<br />
总结:<br />
研究报告了最近十年发现的第一个轴向射流式潮汐破坏事件（TDE）AT2022cmc，也是迄今为止已知的第四个轴向射流式TDE候选者。研究团队对AT2022cmc进行了NuSTAR硬X射线（3-30 keV）观测，并使用NICER、Swift和XMM-Newton获得了软X射线（0.3-6 keV）观测。他们的分析表明，这个宽带X射线光谱可以很好地用fν ∝ ν−0.5（fν ∝ ν−1）来描述，其中ν−0.5（ν−1）在观测者框架中的Ebk ∼ 10 keV的休息能量以下（以上）。他们的模型实现了广义洛伦兹因子的约束，表明射流的核心洛伦兹因子大约为10-100。他们的解释对其他来源如γ射线暴的相对论射流的性质有广泛的影响。这种性质不同于Pasham等人提出的模型，后者认为无线电和X射线来自于物质为主导的射流中的同一发射区。 <div>
AT2022cmc was recently reported as the first on-axis jetted tidal disruption event (TDE) discovered in the last decade, and the fourth on-axis jetted TDE candidate known so far. In this work, we present NuSTAR hard X-ray (3–30 keV) observations of AT2022cmc, as well as soft X-ray (0.3–6 keV) observations obtained by NICER, Swift, and XMM-Newton. Our analysis reveals that the broadband X-ray spectra can be well described by a broken power law with fν ∝ ν−0.5 (fν ∝ ν−1) below (above) the rest-frame break energy of Ebk ∼ 10 keV at the observer frame tobs = 7.8 and 17.6 days since discovery. At tobs = 36.2 days, the X-ray spectrum is consistent with either a single power law or a broken power law. By modeling the spectral energy distribution from radio to hard X-ray across the three NuSTAR observing epochs, we find that the submillimeter/radio emission originates from external shocks at large distances ≳1017 cm from the black hole, the UV/optical light comes from a thermal envelope with radius ∼1015 cm, and the X-ray emission is consistent with synchrotron radiation powered by energy dissipation at intermediate radii within the (likely magnetically dominated) jet. We constrain the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet to be of the order 10–100. Our interpretation differs from the model proposed by Pasham et al. where both the radio and X-rays come from the same emitting zone in a matter-dominated jet. Our model for the jet X-ray emission has broad implications on the nature of relativistic jets in other sources such as gamma-ray bursts.

Mirror stars are a generic prediction of dissipative dark matter (DM) models, including minimal atomic DM and twin baryons in the mirror twin Higgs model. Mirror stars can capture regular matter from the interstellar medium through extremely suppressed kinetic mixing interactions between the regular and the dark photon. This accumulated “nugget” will draw heat from the mirror star core and emit highly characteristic X-ray and optical signals. In this work, we devise a general parameterization of mirror star nugget properties that is independent of the unknown details of mirror star stellar physics, and use the Cloudy spectral synthesis code to obtain realistic and comprehensive predictions for the thermal emissions from optically thin mirror star nuggets. We find that mirror star nuggets populate an extremely well-defined and narrow region of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram that only partially overlaps with the white dwarf population. Our detailed spectral predictions, which we make publicly available, allow us to demonstrate that optically thin nuggets can be clearly distinguished from white dwarf stars by their continuum spectrum shape, and from planetary nebulae and other optically thin standard sources by their highly exotic emission-line ratios. Our work will enable realistic mirror star telescope searches, which may reveal the detailed nature of DM.

总结: 
太阳X射线光谱仪在Hinotori任务期间观测得到了高分辨率的光谱数据，用于研究太阳耀斑中高度电离铁离子的发射线。研究对数据进行了单温度拟合，并与理论预测进行了比较。结果表明，在特定波长范围内，通过使用从j/w强度比估算的单电子温度进行的合成光谱拟合效果良好。此外，还推导出观测线比的经验关系，并根据观察到的线比估计了Fe+25/Fe+24的离子分数。最后指出，Fe xxv线比的系统过量可能暗示了原子参数或原子建模的问题。 <div>
High-resolution spectra observed by the Solar X-ray spectrometer on board the Hinotori mission are revisited. Flat crystals slightly offset to the satellite spin axis produce automatic spectral scans for emission lines emerging from highly charged iron ions in solar flares every half-spin time period. All the downlinked data of the mission are converted to FITS format and major flare spectral data are revived as IDL save files in ISAS/DARTS. Based on these data sets, single-temperature fits are performed for the emission line complex of highly charged iron ions in the wavelength range of 1.75–1.95 Å and compared with theoretical predictions. Synthetic spectra with single electron temperatures estimated from j/w line-intensity ratios fit fairly well for Fe xxiv and Fe xxiii lines in the wavelength range of 1.85–1.88 Å, while intensity ratios of Fe xxv lines (x, y, z) and the inner-shell excitation line of Fe xxiv (q) to the Fe xxv resonance line (w) have systematic excesses. Empirical relations for the observed line ratios are derived. Ion fractions of Fe+25/Fe+24 estimated by intensity ratios of Lyα/w in the temperature range of log Te=7.25–7.45 are consistent with values in ionization equilibrium, and the remaining excesses of the Fe xxv line ratios may suggest problems with the atomic parameters or atomic modeling.

We report commissioning observations of the Si x 1430 nm solar coronal line observed coronagraphically with the Cryogenic Near-Infrared Spectropolarimeter at the National Science Foundation’s Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope. These are the first known spatially resolved observations of this spectral line, which has strong potential as a coronal magnetic field diagnostic. The observations target a complex active region located on the solar northeast limb on 2022 March 4. We present a first analysis of these data that extracts the spectral line properties through a careful treatment of the variable atmospheric transmission that is known to impact this spectral window. Rastered images are created and compared with extreme-UV observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument. A method for estimating the electron density from the Si x observations is then demonstrated that makes use of the forbidden line density-sensitive emissivity and an emission-measure analysis of the SDO/AIA bandpass observations. In addition, we derive an effective temperature and nonthermal line width across the region. This study informs the calibration approaches required for more routine observations of this promising diagnostic line.

The focus of this study is on the spatial and temporal distributions of 2704 solar jets throughout Solar Cycle 24, from beginning to end. This work is a follow-up paper by Liu et al. With this extended data set, we have further confirmed the two distinct distributions of coronal jets: one located in polar regions and another at lower latitudes. Further analysis of the series of coronal jets revealed kink oscillations of the global solar magnetic field. Additionally, studying the northern and southern hemispheres separately showed an antiphase correlation that can be interpreted as a global sausage oscillatory pattern of the loci of the coronal jets. We also investigated how the variability of the solar cycle may impact the power law index of coronal jets by dividing the data set into the rising and declining phases of Solar Cycle 24. However, there is no compelling evidence to suggest that the power law index changes after the maximum. It is worth noting that based on this vast database of solar jets, the degradation of the 304 Å channel of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly instrument on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory can also be identified and confirmed. Finally, we searched for compelling signatures of the presence of active longitude in the coronal jet database. There was no obvious evidence with a high probability of an active longitude; therefore, this question remains yet to be addressed further.

Exploring the concept of a massive photon has been an important area in astronomy and physics. If photons have mass, their propagation in nonvacuum space would be affected by both the nonzero mass mγ and the presence of a plasma medium. This would lead to a delay time proportional to , which deviates from the classical dispersion relation (proportional to ν−2). For the first time, we have derived the dispersion relation of a photon with a nonzero mass propagating in plasma. To reduce the impact of variations in the dispersion measure (DM), we employed the high-precision timing data to constrain the upper bound of the photon mass. Specifically, the DM/time of arrival (TOA) uncertainties derived from ultrawide bandwidth (UWB) observations conducted by the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) are used. The dedispersed pulses from fast radio bursts (FRBs) with minimal scattering effects are also used to constrain the upper bound of photon mass. The stringent limit on the photon mass is determined by uncertainties of the TOA of pulsars, with an optimum value of 9.52 × 10−46 kg (5.34 × 10−10 eV c−2). In the future, it is essential to investigate the photon mass, as pulsar timing data are collected by PPTA and UWB receivers, or FRBs with wideband spectra are detected by UWB receivers.

<div> 电子加热, 离子电子冲击, 电动势跳跃, 离子动能, 磁波
总结:
在这篇文章中，研究了在低βp（βp = 0.25）冲击波情况下，通过1D和2D粒子在单元模拟中测量了热电子的能量激发。研究发现，电子加热由双极、B-平行电位跳跃Δϕ∥描述，它与电子温度跳跃大致成线性关系。在模拟中得出的电位跳跃为 -0.2，与之前的测量和模拟结果一致。不考虑离对角线电子压强张量项可能会导致在低βp冲击波中对Δϕ∥的系统低估。此外，研究还关注了两种θBn = 65°的冲击波情况，分别是具有沿B方向的30di鸣波前体的情况和具有倾斜于B的短5di鸣波前体的情况。在鸣波前体中，Δϕ∥随着冲击波朝向呈现出沿多个鸣波波长的逐渐上升，并且在磁场波谷内还具有局部尖峰。对于θBn = 65°的情况的1D模拟显示，Δϕ∥对电子等离子体与回旋频率比值ωpe/Ωce的依赖性较弱，当mi/me增加到真实的质子-电子值1836时，Δϕ∥减少了一倍。 <div>
We measure the thermal electron energization in 1D and 2D particle-in-cell simulations of quasi-perpendicular, low-beta (βp = 0.25) collisionless ion–electron shocks with mass ratio mi/me = 200, fast Mach number –4, and upstream magnetic field angle θBn = 55°–85° from the shock normal . It is known that shock electron heating is described by an ambipolar, B-parallel electric potential jump, Δϕ∥, that scales roughly linearly with the electron temperature jump. Our simulations have –0.2 in units of the pre-shock ions’ bulk kinetic energy, in agreement with prior measurements and simulations. Different ways to measure ϕ∥, including the use of de Hoffmann–Teller frame fields, agree to tens-of-percent accuracy. Neglecting off-diagonal electron pressure tensor terms can lead to a systematic underestimate of ϕ∥ in our low-βp shocks. We further focus on two θBn = 65° shocks: a ( ) case with a long, 30di precursor of whistler waves along , and a ( ) case with a shorter, 5di precursor of whistlers oblique to both and B; di is the ion skin depth. Within the precursors, ϕ∥ has a secular rise toward the shock along multiple whistler wavelengths and also has localized spikes within magnetic troughs. In a 1D simulation of the , θBn = 65° case, ϕ∥ shows a weak dependence on the electron plasma-to-cyclotron frequency ratio ωpe/Ωce, and ϕ∥ decreases by a factor of 2 as mi/me is raised to the true proton–electron value of 1836.

<div> UMa3/U1、暗物质、N-body simulations、LCDM halo、多次观测

UMa3/U1是迄今为止已知的银河系卫星中最微弱的，其质量较小，半光半径为3 ±1 pc。有可能是已发现的最暗淡的星系，或者是围绕银河系轨道上已知最微弱的自引力星团。其视向速度离散性暗示存在暗物质，尽管目前的测量由于未知的潜在双星贡献而不确定。N-body模拟表明，如果是自引力的话，该系统在银河系潮汐场中不可能存活比单次轨道（约0.4 Gyr）更久，这强烈暗示了该系统受到大量暗物质的稳定。如果UMa3/U1在一个约10^9M⊙的线性冷暗物质（LCDM）暗物质晕中形成，则其速度离散度有望预测为大约1 km s^-1。这与目前的估计大致一致，不考虑双星，则将σlos放在1-4 km s^-1的范围内。由于其密集的拱，这样的暗物质晕应该能够在银河系潮汐场中存活下来，使UMa3/U1到目前为止相对完好无损。这意味着UMa3/U1可能是银河系最微弱和最密集的矮星系卫星，对于替代暗物质模型以及LCDM宇宙学中光亮星系形成的最低暗物质晕质量阈值都有重要影响。我们的研究呼吁进行多次高分辨率光谱跟进观测以确认这一非凡系统的暗物质含量。<br /><br />总结:UMa3/U1是银河系中最微弱的卫星系统之一，其中可能存在大量暗物质，对于宇宙学和星系形成模型有重要影响。我们需要进行多次观测以确认其暗物质成分。 <div>
The recently discovered stellar system Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 (UMa3/U1) is the faintest known Milky Way satellite to date. With a stellar mass of and a half-light radius of 3 ± 1 pc, it is either the darkest galaxy ever discovered or the faintest self-gravitating star cluster known to orbit the Galaxy. Its line-of-sight velocity dispersion suggests the presence of dark matter, although current measurements are inconclusive because of the unknown contribution to the dispersion of potential binary stars. We use N-body simulations to show that, if self-gravitating, the system could not survive in the Milky Way tidal field for much longer than a single orbit (roughly 0.4 Gyr), which strongly suggests that the system is stabilized by the presence of large amounts of dark matter. If UMa3/U1 formed at the center of a ∼109M⊙ cuspy LCDM halo, its velocity dispersion would be predicted to be of order ∼1 km s−1. This is roughly consistent with the current estimate, which, neglecting binaries, places σlos in the range 1–4 km s−1. Because of its dense cusp, such a halo should be able to survive the Milky Way tidal field, keeping UMa3/U1 relatively unscathed until the present time. This implies that UMa3/U1 is plausibly the faintest and densest dwarf galaxy satellite of the Milky Way, with important implications for alternative dark matter models and for the minimum halo mass threshold for luminous galaxy formation in the LCDM cosmology. Our results call for multi-epoch high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up to confirm the dark matter content of this extraordinary system.

<br />总结:
本研究使用哈勃空间望远镜对孤立、抑制的矮星系Tucana中374颗红巨星分支恒星的金属丰度进行测量。研究发现了Tucana的全局金属丰度分布功能，以及其金属丰度梯度。Tucana的红巨星分支呈现出两个不同的金属丰度分布，与银河系卫星相比，Tucana在固定恒星质量下更为富含金属。此外，约有2%的Tucana恒星的铁丰度低于-3%，而20%的恒星的铁丰度高于-1%。这项研究为社区提供了进行光谱后续观测的目录。 <div>
We measure the metallicities of 374 red giant branch (RGB) stars in the isolated, quenched dwarf galaxy Tucana using Hubble Space Telescope narrowband (F395N) calcium H and K imaging. Our sample is a factor of ∼7 larger than what is available from previous studies. Our main findings are as follows. (i) A global metallicity distribution function (MDF) with and . (ii) A metallicity gradient of −0.54 ± 0.07 dex (−2.1 ± 0.3 dex kpc−1) over the extent of our imaging (∼2.5 Re), which is steeper than literature measurements. Our finding is consistent with predicted gradients from the publicly available FIRE-2 simulations, in which bursty star formation creates stellar population gradients and dark matter cores. (iii) Tucana’s bifurcated RGB has distinct metallicities: a blue RGB with and and a red RGB with and . (iv) At fixed stellar mass, Tucana is more metal-rich than Milky Way satellites by ∼0.4 dex, but its blue RGB is chemically comparable to the satellites. Tucana’s MDF appears consistent with star-forming isolated dwarfs, though MDFs of the latter are not as well populated. (v) About 2% of Tucana’s stars have [Fe/H] < −3% and 20% have [Fe/H] > −1. We provide a catalog for community spectroscopic follow-up.

<div> AGN, continuum emission, broad emission lines, reverberation mapping, Broad Emission Line MApping Code
<br />
这篇文章介绍了一种新的前向建模工具——Broad Emission Line MApping Code，该工具可以模拟宽发射线区域对任何给定输入光变曲线的速度分辨的回响响应。通过模拟以母线驱动的大气流的球状BLR和具有开普勒旋转的盘状BLR的一组模型对单个光谱脉冲的速度响应，我们计算了响应加权的时间延迟（反射“滞后”），这被认为是BLR的光度加权半径的代理。我们发现，当云层以各向同性发射并且是辐射为主时（部分电离）时，响应加权的延迟才等价于光度加权的半径。否则，光度加权的半径可能会被高估多达两倍。 
<br /><br />总结: <div>
The variable continuum emission of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) produces corresponding responses in the broad emission lines, which are modulated by light travel delays, and contain information on the physical properties, structure, and kinematics of the emitting gas region. The reverberation mapping technique, a time series analysis of the driving light curve and response, can recover some of this information, including the size and velocity field of the broad-line region (BLR). Here we introduce a new forward-modeling tool, the Broad Emission Line MApping Code, which simulates the velocity-resolved reverberation response of the BLR to any given input light curve by setting up a 3D ensemble of gas clouds for various specified geometries, velocity fields, and cloud properties. In this work, we present numerical approximations to the transfer function by simulating the velocity-resolved responses to a single continuum pulse for sets of models representing a spherical BLR with a radiatively driven outflow and a disklike BLR with Keplerian rotation. We explore how the structure, velocity field, and other BLR properties affect the transfer function. We calculate the response-weighted time delay (reverberation “lag”), which is considered to be a proxy for the luminosity-weighted radius of the BLR. We investigate the effects of anisotropic cloud emission and matter-bounded (completely ionized) clouds and find the response-weighted delay is only equivalent to the luminosity-weighted radius when clouds emit isotropically and are radiation-bounded (partially ionized). Otherwise, the luminosity-weighted radius can be overestimated by up to a factor of 2.

总结:<br />
本研究通过对未来的鲁宾天文台遗产空间与时间调查（LSST）的模拟光变曲线进行分析，预测了二进制超大质量黑洞在这项调查中的可检测性。研究发现，虽然固有变异性可能导致对两个黑洞的干扰，但对于大部分的潜在二进制光变曲线，二进制信号的周期和相位可以被辨别出来。然而，由于赛弗尔星系核的固有变异性，二进制幅度被高估且难以恢复。此外，最亮的赛弗尔星系核模拟光变曲线的假阳性率高达60％。因此，使用光度周期性进行纯电磁探测的二进制样本中将存在大量的假阳性。本研究为了解鲁宾所发现的二进制候选者的真实和假阳性率提供了一种重要且经济的方法。 <div>
Periodic signatures in time-domain observations of quasars have been used to search for binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs). These searches, across existing time-domain surveys, have produced several hundred candidates. The general stochastic variability of quasars, however, can masquerade as a false-positive periodic signal, especially when monitoring cadence and duration are limited. In this work, we predict the detectability of binary SMBHs in the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We apply computationally inexpensive sinusoidal curve fits to millions of simulated LSST Deep Drilling Field light curves of both single, isolated quasars and binary quasars. The period and phase of simulated binary signals can generally be disentangled from quasar variability. Binary amplitude is overestimated and poorly recovered for two-thirds of potential binaries due to quasar accretion variability. Quasars with strong intrinsic variability can obscure a binary signal too much for recovery. We also find that the most luminous quasars mimic current binary candidate light curves and their properties: The false-positive rates are 60% for these quasars. The reliable recovery of binary period and phase for a wide range of input binary LSST light curves is promising for multi-messenger characterization of binary SMBHs. However, pure electromagnetic detections of binaries using photometric periodicity with amplitude greater than 0.1 mag will result in samples that are overwhelmed by false positives. This paper represents an important and computationally inexpensive way forward for understanding the true and false-positive rates for binary candidates identified by Rubin.

总结: 
1. 介绍了Perseus星系团作为X射线天空中最亮的星系团的特点及其对研究星系团内部介质的重要性。
2. 提到了以前由于NuSTAR点扩散函数的延伸翼和AGN的活跃性使得对Perseus星系团中心附近的弥散辐射的研究几乎不可能进行。
3. 介绍了新开发的nucrossarf开源软件包，允许对点源和弥散源的贡献进行建模，以便考虑AGN的散射光。
4. 对使用NuSTAR对Perseus星系团进行的弥散硬X射线（3-25keV）辐射分析的结果进行了概述，发现了超出20keV的约10%的辐射过量。
5. 讨论了这种过量的潜在起源和影响，并提出了对nucrossarf系统不确定性的表征，这对未来的工作可能有用。 <div>
As the brightest galaxy cluster in the X-ray sky, Perseus is an excellent target for studying the intracluster medium (ICM), but until recently, its active galactic nucleus (AGN) made studies of the diffuse emission near its center nearly impossible to accomplish with NuSTAR, due to the extended wings of NuSTAR's point-spread function. The development of a new open-source software package—nucrossarf—now allows the contribution from point and diffuse sources to be modeled so that scattered light from the AGN can be accounted for. Using this technique, we present an analysis of diffuse hard X-ray (3–25 keV) emission from the ICM using three archival NuSTAR observations of the Perseus cluster. We find a ∼10% excess of emission beyond 20 keV not describable by purely thermal models. By performing similar analyses of AGNs in archival observations, we have characterized the systematic uncertainty of the modeled AGN contribution to be 3.4%. However, in order to explain the excess, the total scattered AGN emission would have to be 39% stronger than we have measured. We test physical explanations for the excess, such as diffuse inverse-Compton emission potentially originating from the radio mini-halo, but we determine that none of the models are compelling. An upper limit on the inverse-Compton flux (≤1.5 × 10−11 erg s−1 cm−2) and a corresponding lower limit on the global magnetic field strength (≥0.35 μG) are derived. We discuss the potential origin and implications of the excess and present our characterization of the nucrossarf systematic uncertainty, which should be useful for future work.

We present Submillimeter Array (SMA) mapping of 12CO J = 2 → 1, 13CO J = 2 → 1, and CN N = 2 → 1 emission from the ring-like planetary nebula NGC 3132, one of the subjects of JWST Early Release Observation near-infrared imaging. The ∼5″ resolution SMA data demonstrate that the Southern Ring’s main, bright, molecule-rich ring is indeed an expanding ring, as opposed to a limb-brightened shell, in terms of its intrinsic (physical) structure. This suggests that NGC 3132 is a bipolar nebula viewed more or less pole-on (inclination ∼15°–30°). The SMA data furthermore reveal that the nebula harbors a second expanding molecular ring that is aligned almost orthogonally to the main, bright molecular ring. We propose that this two-ring structure is the remnant of an ellipsoidal molecular envelope of ejecta that terminated the progenitor star’s asymptotic giant branch evolution and was subsequently disrupted by a series of misaligned fast, collimated outflows or jets resulting from interactions between the progenitor and one or more companions.

<br /><br />总结:本研究重新评估了来自NVSS目录的偶极估计与CMB测量之间的明显不一致。研究发现，在确定预期的偶极信号时，考虑NVSS源的shot noise和聚类以及运动贡献至关重要。我们使用了聚类红移方法和交叉匹配技术来优化聚类项的估计。然后，在标准的ΛCDM宇宙学模型中，包括所有（即运动、shot noise和聚类）偶极分量，推导出了NVSS偶极的概率分布。我们的模型与以往大部分文献中的NVSS偶极测量基本一致，精度达到或优于2σ。我们得出结论，NVSS偶极与CMB偶极的运动起源在ΛCDM模型内是一致的。 <div>
The dipole moment in the angular distribution of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is thought to originate from the doppler effect and our motion relative to the CMB frame. Observations of large-scale structure (LSS) should show a related “kinematic dipole” and help test the kinematic origin of the CMB dipole. Intriguingly, many previous LSS dipole studies suggest discrepancies with the expectations from the CMB. Here, we reassess the apparent inconsistency between the CMB measurements and dipole estimates from the NVSS catalog of radio sources. We find that it is important to account for the shot noise and clustering of the NVSS sources, as well as kinematic contributions, in determining the expected dipole signal. We use the clustering redshift method and a cross-matching technique to refine estimates of the clustering term. We then derive a probability distribution for the expected NVSS dipole in a standard ΛCDM cosmological model including all (i.e., kinematic, shot noise, and clustering) dipole components. Our model agrees with most of the previous NVSS dipole measurements in the literature at better than ≲2σ. We conclude that the NVSS dipole is consistent with a kinematic origin for the CMB dipole within ΛCDM.

本文提出了一种通过观测高红移时期的H i 21 cm和CO线强度图来重建宇宙初始密度分布的方法。H i 21 cm和CO线强度图提供了关于密度场的互补信息，H i 21 cm场是中性区域的物质分布的代理，而CO线强度图对高密度的星形成区域敏感，这些区域是再电离源。通过共轭梯度法和代价函数最小化的方式，通过分析得到代价函数的梯度的解析表达式来实现密度场的重建。研究结果显示，通过半数值模拟再电离的输入图来重新模拟的强度图在再电离的所有阶段具有小于7%的均方根误差。这种重建方法在CO图上应用了一个乐观的水平的射线噪声或者每幅图应用了小于标准偏差的10%的白噪声时，仍然表现出了约10%的均方根误差的鲁棒性。这个概念验证的工作证明了重建方法的稳健性，从而提供了一种从高红移观测中重建宇宙初始密度分布的有效技术。 <div>
The initial density distribution provides a basis for understanding the complete evolution of cosmological density fluctuations. While reconstruction in our local Universe exploits the observations of galaxy surveys with large volumes, observations of high-redshift galaxies are performed with a small field of view and therefore can hardly be used for reconstruction. Here, we propose reconstructing the initial density field using the H i 21 cm and CO line intensity maps from the epoch of reionization. Observations of these two intensity maps provide complementary information on the density field—the H i 21 cm field is a proxy of matter distributions in the neutral regions, while the CO line intensity maps are sensitive to the high-density, star-forming regions that host the sources for reionization. Technically, we employ the conjugate gradient method and develop the machinery for minimizing the cost function for the intensity mapping observations. Analytical expressions for the gradient of cost function are derived explicitly. We show that the resimulated intensity maps match the input maps of mock observations using semi-numerical simulations of reionization with an rms error ≲7% at all stages of reionization. This reconstruction is also robust with an rms error of ∼10% when an optimistic level of shot noise is applied to the CO map or white noise at the level of ≲10% of the standard deviation is applied to each map. Our proof-of-concept work demonstrates the robustness of the reconstruction method, thereby providing an effective technique for reconstructing the cosmological initial density distribution from high-redshift observations.

总结:
太阳风观测受限于黄道平面附近，IMAP任务计划的GLOWS仪器旨在通过观测星际中性氢的反散射辉光，间接获取太阳风的纬度结构。研究发现，太阳光照的变化会立即反映在辉光上，但其调整时间比变化上升时间更长。相反，星际氢的电离率变化会与辉光亮度呈反相关，并且存在数月的延迟。此外，辉光对于太阳极地区的电离率变化不敏感，因此需要使用适当的参数函数来近似电离率剖面，以检测极地区的电离率和太阳风变化。 <div>
Direct observations of solar wind are mostly limited to the vicinity of the ecliptic plane. Retrieving the latitudinal structure of solar wind indirectly based on observations of the backscatter glow of interstellar neutral hydrogen is complex and requires support from theoretical models. The GLOWS instrument, to operate on the planned IMAP mission, will scan the helioglow along circumsolar rings with an angular distance of ∼75°. Its objective is to retrieve the latitudinal structure of the ionization rate of interstellar hydrogen and with this the structure of the solar wind. In preparation for the future analysis, we studied the sensitivity of the light curves to temporal and latitudinal variation of the ionization rate of interstellar hydrogen and the solar Lyα illumination. Based on carefully planned numerical experiments, we analyze the time delay and relaxation time of the system for variations of the ionization rate and solar illumination in heliolatitude and with time. We found that variations in the solar illumination are reflected in the helioglow without delay, but relaxation takes longer than the variation rise time. By contrast, variations in the ionization rate are anticorrelated with the helioglow brightness with a delay of several months. We also found that the helioglow is not sensitive to variations in the ionization rate at the solar poles, so retrieving the ionization rate and solar wind at the poles requires approximation of the ionization rate profiles with appropriate parametric functions.

Employing the infrared color excess technique with both near-infrared and mid-infrared photometric data, a high-resolution extinction map in the K band (AK) is constructed for three dark clouds: L1689, L1709, and L1712. The derived extinction map has a resolution of and reaches a depth of AK ∼ 3 mag. The FIR optical depths τ250 at a reference wavelength of 250 μm are obtained by fitting the Herschel PACS and SPIRE continuum data at 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 μm using a modified blackbody model. The average dust opacity per unit gas mass at 250 μm, rκ250, is determined through a pixel-by-pixel correlation of τ250 with AK, yielding a value of approximately 0.09 cm2 g−1, which is about 2–3 times higher than the typical value in the diffuse interstellar medium. Additionally, an independent analysis across 16 subregions within the Ophiuchus cloud indicates spatial variations in dust opacity, with values ranging from 0.07 to 0.12 cm2 g−1. Although the observed trend of increasing dust opacity with higher extinction implies grain growth, our findings indicate that rapid grain growth has clearly not yet occurred in the dark clouds studied in this work.

<title>Revision of the GeV γ-Ray Emission in the Region of HESS J1813-178 with Fermi-LAT</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
HESS J1813-178 is one of the brightest and most compact TeV γ-ray sources, and whether its γ-ray emission is associated with supernova remnant (SNR), pulsar wind nebula (PWN), or young stellar cluster (YSC) is still under debate. By analyzing the GeV γ-ray data in the field of HESS J1813-178 using 14 yr of PASS 8 data recorded by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT), we report the discovery of three different sources with different spectra in this region. The hard source with a PL spectral index of 2.11 ± 0.08 has a small size extension, which is spatially and spectrally coincident with the TeV γ-ray emission from HESS J1813-178. CO observations display the dense molecular clouds surrounding HESS J1813-178 in the velocity range of 45–60 km s−1. The possible origins of the γ-ray emission from HESS J1813-178 are discussed, including SNR G12.820.02, the PWN driven by the energetic X-ray pulsar PSR J1813-1749 and YSC Cl 1813-178. However, none of them can be ruled out clearly. Note that the maximum energy of protons in the hadronic model should exceed a few hundred TeV, which makes HESS J1813-178 a promising PeVatron. A detailed LHAASO data analysis about the morphology and spectrum would be helpful to investigate the origin of the γ-ray emission in this region and test its PeVatron nature.

<title>Relativistic Alfvén Turbulence at Kinetic Scales</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In a strongly magnetized, magnetically dominated relativistic plasma, Alfvénic turbulence can extend to scales much smaller than the particle inertial scales. It leads to an energy cascade somewhat analogous to inertial- or kinetic-Alfvén turbulent cascades existing in nonrelativistic space and astrophysical plasmas. Based on phenomenological modeling and particle-in-cell numerical simulations, we propose that the energy spectrum of such relativistic kinetic-scale Alfvénic turbulence is close to k−3 or slightly steeper than that due to intermittency corrections or Landau damping. We note the analogy of this spectrum with the Kraichnan spectrum corresponding to the enstrophy cascade in 2D incompressible fluid turbulence. Such turbulence strongly energizes particles in the direction parallel to the background magnetic field, leading to nearly one-dimensional particle momentum distributions. We find that these distributions have universal log-normal statistics.

<title>Search for GeV Gamma-Ray Emission from Possible TeV-bright Red Dwarfs with Fermi-LAT</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Red dwarfs have been suggested to be among the possible astrophysical species accelerating particles and emitting TeV γ-rays. In an effort to search for the GeV γ-ray counterparts of the suggested TeV emission from eight red dwarfs, we analyze the 0.2–500 GeV γ-ray emission of the regions covering them, exploiting the ∼13.6 yr Pass 8 data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). A GeV γ-ray emission excess with a significance of 3.8σ is detected in the direction of the red dwarf V962 Tau. This emission contains V962 Tau in a 1σ error radius and is independent of the catalog source. However, the stellar flare scenario can hardly explain the total energy and lightcurve (LC) derived from the γ-ray emission in view of the spectral analysis. We also analyze the LCs in the positions of the eight red dwarfs, and no time bin with a significance >5σ is found. Therefore, no significant emission from the red dwarfs could be concluded to have been detected by Fermi-LAT.

<title>Dwarf Pulses of 10 Pulsars Detected by FAST</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
How pulsars radiate is a long-standing problem. Detailed polarization measurements of individual pulses shed light on currently unknown emission processes. Recently, based on supersensitive observations, dwarf pulses have been recognized as weak narrow pulses often appearing during the nulling state. In this study, we report the detection of dwarf pulses from 10 pulsars, PSRs B0525+21, B1237+25, J1538+2345, J1824−0127, J1851−0053, B1901+10, J1939+10, B1944+17, B2000+40, and J2112+4058, based on observations conducted with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope. Dwarf pulses of five pulsars are clearly discernible in the two-dimensional distribution of pulse intensity and pulse width. For the other five pulsars, PSRs J1538+2345, J1824−0127, J1939+10, B2000+40, and J2112+4058, only a few dwarf pulses are detected from pulse stacks. The dwarf pulses can emerge in both cone and core emission components for PSR B1237+25, and the polarization angles of these dwarf pulses are mostly in the orthogonal polarization mode of normal pulses for PSR B1944+17. In general, pulsars with detected dwarf pulses tend to be located within the “death valley” region of the distribution of pulsar periods and period derivatives.

<title>Petrogenesis of Erg Chech 002 Achondrite and Implications for an Altered Magma Ocean</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study conducts mineralogical and chemical investigations on the oldest achondrite, Erg Chech 002 (∼4565 million yr old). This meteorite exhibits a disequilibrium igneous texture characterized by high-Mg-number (atomic Mg/(Mg + Fe2+)) orthopyroxene xenocrysts (Mg number = 60–80) embedded in an andesitic groundmass. Our research reveals that these xenocrysts were early formed crystals, loosely accumulated or scattered in the short-period magma ocean on the parent body. Subsequently, these crystals underwent agitation due to the influx of external materials. The assimilation of these materials enriched the 16O component of the magma ocean and induced a relatively reduced state. Furthermore, this process significantly cooled the magma ocean and inhibited the evaporation of alkali elements, leading to elevated concentrations of Na and K within the meteorite. Our findings suggest that the introduced materials are probably sourced from the reservoirs of CR clan meteorites, indicating extensive transport and mixing of materials within the early solar system.

<title>Giant Biconical Dust Filaments in the Starburst Galaxy NGC 1808</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad2eab</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the results from an analysis of multiwavelength archival data on the multiphase outflow in the starburst galaxy NGC 1808. We report the detection at 70 and 100 μm of dust filaments that extend up to ∼13 kpc from the galactic midplane and trace an edge-brightened biconical structure along the minor axis of the galaxy. The inner filaments are roughly cospatial with previously identified optical dust filaments, extraplanar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission, and neutral and ionized gaseous outflows. The 70/160 μm flux ratio, a proxy for the dust temperature, is elevated along the edges of the cones, indicating that the dusty medium has been driven out of the central regions of these cones and is possibly shock-heated by a large-scale outflow. We establish lower limits on the extraplanar dust mass and mean height above the stellar disk of and ∣ z ∣ ∼ 5 kpc. The energy requirement of (5.1–9.6) × 1056 erg needed to lift the dusty material, assuming a Milky Way–like dust-to-gas ratio, can be supplied by the current starburst, with a measured star formation rate of 3.5–5.4 M⊙ yr−1 over a timescale of (4–26) ξ−1 Myr, where ξ is the efficiency of energy transfer. We conclude that a starburst-driven outflow is the most likely mechanism by which the dust features were formed.

<title>Young Star Clusters Dominate the Production of Detached Black Hole–Star Binaries</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad2f2c</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The recent discovery of two detached black hole–star (BH–star) binaries from Gaia’s third data release has sparked interest in understanding the formation mechanisms of these systems. We investigate the formation of these systems by dynamical processes in young star clusters (SCs) and via isolated binary (IB) evolution, using a combination of direct N-body and population synthesis simulations. We find that dynamical formation in SCs is nearly 50 times more efficient per unit of star formation at producing BH–star binaries than IB evolution. We expand this analysis to the full Milky Way (MW) using a FIRE-2 hydrodynamical simulation of an MW-mass galaxy. Even assuming that only 10% of star formation goes into SCs, we find that approximately four out of every five BH–star systems are formed dynamically, and that the MW contains a total of ∼2 × 105 BH–star systems. Many of these dynamically formed systems have longer orbital periods, greater eccentricities, and greater black hole masses than their isolated counterparts. For binaries older than 100 Myr, we show that any detectable system with e ≳ 0.5 or MBH ≳ 10 M⊙ can only be formed through dynamical processes. Our MW model predicts between 64 and 215 such detections from the complete DR4 Gaia catalog, with the majority of systems being dynamically formed in massive and metal-rich SCs. Finally, we compare our populations to the recently discovered Gaia BH1 and Gaia BH2, and conclude that the dynamical scenario is the most favorable formation pathway for both systems.

<div> Line intensity mapping, LIM, ground-based millimeter-wavelength surveys, dark energy, theory of gravity
总结: 
本文研究了下一代地基毫米波波长LIM调查在约束ΛCDM以外的几种模型方面的潜力。研究考虑了CO旋转线的自相关谱和[C ii]精细结构线的测量，在红移范围为0.25< z <12。作者针对约旦-布朗斯-迪克和轴子驱动的早期暗能量模型以及基于宇宙尺度的引力有效描述的三个现象模型进行了深入研究。研究表明，未来十年内可部署的LIM调查具有显著改善所有考虑模型的潜力，提高水平从几倍到一个数量级。 <div>
Line intensity mapping (LIM) can provide a powerful means to constrain the theory of gravity and the nature of dark energy at low and high redshifts by mapping the large-scale structure over many redshift epochs. In this paper, we investigate the potential of the next generation ground-based millimeter-wavelength LIM surveys in constraining several models beyond ΛCDM, involving either a dynamic dark energy component or modifications of the theory of gravity. Limiting ourselves to two-point clustering statistics, we consider the measurements of auto-spectra of several CO rotational lines (from J = 2−1 to J = 6−5) and the [C ii] fine structure line in the redshift range of 0.25 < z < 12. We consider different models beyond ΛCDM, each one with different signatures and peculiarities. Among them, we focus on Jordan–Brans–Dicke and axion-driven early dark energy models as examples of well-studied scalar-tensor theories acting at late and early times, respectively. Additionally, we consider three phenomenological models based on an effective description of gravity at cosmological scales. We show that LIM surveys deployable within a decade (with ∼108 spectrometer hours) have the potential to improve upon the current bounds on all considered models significantly. The level of improvements range from a factor of a few to an order of magnitude.

总结: <br />
本研究报告了第一个银河脉冲超亮X射线源 (PULX) Swift J0243.6+6124 的相位分辨光谱结果，利用由硬X射线调制望远镜 (Insight-HXMT) 收集的数据对其2017年至2018年的突发峰值进行建模。Insight-HXMT的广泛能量覆盖范围使我们能够获得更精确的光谱连续体，以减少广铁线轮廓与其他组件之间的耦合。我们使用三种不同的连续体光谱模型，但得到类似的铁线结果。首次在PULX中检测到广铁线的脉冲特征。该铁线宽度和强度的变化，σ约为1.2-1.5keV，其相位偏移约为脉冲相位的0.25。我们推测内部厚盘不均匀的受加速柱的辐射产生了广铁线的调制变化。此外，非脉冲窄线被认为来自外部盘区域。 <div>
We report the phase-resolved spectral results of the first Galactic pulsating ultraluminous X-ray source (PULX) Swift J0243.6+6124, modeling its 2017–2018 outburst peak using data collected by the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT). The broad energy coverage of Insight-HXMT allows us to obtain a more accurate spectral continuum to reduce the coupling of broad iron line profiles with other components. We use three different continuum spectrum models but obtain similar iron line results. For the first time, we detect the pulse characteristics of the broad iron line in a PULX. The variation in the width and intensity of this iron line with σ ∼ 1.2–1.5 keV has a phase offset of about 0.25 from the pulse phase. We suggest that the uneven irradiation of the thick inner disk by the accretion column produces the modulated variation of the broad iron line. In addition, the nonpulsed narrow line is suggested to come from the outer disk region.

<div> CSS galaxies, AGN feedback, UV emission, jet-induced star formation, Hubble Space Telescope

总结:<br /><br />本文首次系统搜索紧凑陡峭谱（CSS）射电星系中来自射电源驱动的活跃星系核（AGN）反馈的紫外线特征。通过对7个强大的CSS星系进行观察，发现其中6个存在延伸的紫外线连续发射，与射电喷流轴向共同存在的紫外线结。这表明射电诱导的恒星形成可能是原因。此外，观察结果与演化综合模型一致，显示出最近约1-8百万年内的星形成活动可能是由当前或较早期的射电发射引发的，或者是由于受到周围密集环境的限制，射电源增长受挫。虽然需要进一步观测来限制观察到的紫外线中的活动相关成分，但检测到的射流诱导恒星形成确认了射流反馈模型的一个重要预测。 <div>
We present the first systematic search for UV signatures from radio source-driven active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback in Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) radio galaxies. Owing to their characteristic sub-galactic jets (1–20 kpc projected linear sizes), CSS hosts are excellent laboratories for probing galaxy scale feedback via jet-triggered star formation. The sample consists of seven powerful CSS galaxies, and two galaxies host to radio sources >20 kpc as the control, at low to intermediate redshifts (z < 0.6). Our new Hubble Space Telescope images show extended UV continuum emission in six out of seven CSS galaxies, with five CSS hosts exhibiting UV knots cospatial and aligned along the radio-jet axis. Young (≲ 10 Myr), massive (≳ 5 M⊙) stellar populations are likely to be the dominant source of the blue excess emission in radio galaxies at these redshifts. Hence, the radio-aligned UV regions could be attributed to jet-induced starbursts. Lower near-UV star formation rates compared to other indicators suggest low scattered AGN light contribution to the observed UV. Dust attenuation of UV emission appears unlikely from high internal extinction correction estimates in most sources. Comparison with evolutionary synthesis models shows that our observations are consistent with recent (∼1−8 Myr old) star-forming activity likely triggered by current or an earlier episode of radio emission, or by a confined radio source that has frustrated growth, due to a dense environment. While follow-up spectroscopic and polarized light observations are needed to constrain the activity-related components in the observed UV, the detection of jet-induced star formation is a confirmation of an important prediction of the jet feedback paradigm.

Magnetic reconnection is understood to be the main physical process that facilitates the transformation of magnetic energy into heat, motion, and particle acceleration during solar eruptions. Yet, observational constraints on reconnection region properties and dynamics are limited due to a lack of high-cadence and high-spatial-resolution observations. By studying the evolution and morphology of postreconnected field-lines footpoints, or flare ribbons and vector photospheric magnetic field, we estimate the magnetic reconnection flux and its rate of change with time to study the flare reconnection process and dynamics of the current sheet above. We compare high-resolution imaging data to study the evolution of the fine structure in flare ribbons as ribbons spread away from the polarity inversion line. Using data from two illustrative events (one M- and X-class flare), we explore the relationship between the ribbon-front fine structure and the temporal development of bursts in the reconnection region. Additionally, we use the RibbonDB database to perform statistical analysis of 73 (C- to X-class) flares and identify quasiperiodic pulsation (QPP) properties using the Wavelet Transform. Our main finding is the discovery of QPP signatures in the derived magnetic reconnection rates in both example events and the large flare sample. We find that the oscillation periods range from 1 to 4 minutes. Furthermore, we find nearly cotemporal bursts in Hard X-ray (HXR) emission profiles. We discuss how dynamical processes in the current sheet involving plasmoids can explain the nearly cotemporal signatures of quasiperiodicity in the reconnection rates and HXR emission.

The strongly coupled hydrodynamic, magnetic, and radiation properties of the plasma in the solar chromosphere make it a region of the Sun's atmosphere that is poorly understood. We use data obtained with the high-resolution Visible Broadband Imager (VBI) equipped with an Hβ filter and the Visible Spectro-Polarimeter (ViSP) on the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope to investigate the fine-scale structure of the plage chromosphere. To aid in the interpretation of the VBI imaging data, we also analyze spectra from the CHROMospheric Imaging Spectrometer on the Swedish Solar Telescope. The analysis of spectral properties, such as enhanced line widths and line depths, explains the high contrast of the fibrils relative to the background atmosphere demonstrating that Hβ is an excellent diagnostic for the enigmatic fine-scale structure of the chromosphere. A correlation between the parameters of the Hβ line indicates that opacity broadening created by overdense fibrils could be the main reason for the spectral line broadening frequently observed in chromospheric fine-scale structures. Spectropolarimetric inversions of the ViSP data in the Ca ii 8542 Å and Fe i 6301/6302 Å lines are used to construct semiempirical models of the plage atmosphere. Inversion outputs indicate the existence of dense fibrils in the Ca ii 8542 Å line. The analyses of the ViSP data show that the morphological characteristics, such as orientation, inclination, and length of fibrils, are defined by the topology of the magnetic field in the photosphere. Chromospheric maps reveal a prominent magnetic canopy in the area where fibrils are directed toward the observer.

Much of the information gleaned from observations of star-forming regions comes from the analysis of their molecular emission spectra, particularly in the radio regime. The time-consuming nature of fitting synthetic spectra to observations interactively for such line-rich sources, however, often results in such analysis being limited to data extracted from a single-dish observation or a handful of pixels from an interferometric observation. Yet, star-forming regions display a wide variety of physical conditions that are difficult, if not impossible, to accurately characterize with such a limited number of spectra. We have developed an automated fitting routine that visits every pixel in the field of view of an Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) data cube and determines the best-fit physical parameters, including excitation temperature and column densities, for a given list of molecules. In this proof-of-concept work, we provide an overview of the fitting routine and apply it to 0.″26, 1.1 km s−1 resolution ALMA observations of two sites of massive star formation in NGC 6334I. Parameters were found for 21 distinct molecules by generating synthetic spectra across 7.48 GHz of spectral bandwidth between 280 and 351 GHz. Spatial images of the derived parameters for each of the >8000 pixels are presented with special attention paid to the C2H4O2 isomers and their relative variations. We highlight the greater scientific utility of the column density and velocity images of individual molecules compared to traditional moment maps of single transitions.

We describe a novel method for modeling the global, steady solar wind using photospheric magnetic fields as a driving boundary condition. Prior wind models in this class include both rapid heuristic methods that use potential field extrapolation and variants thereof, trading rigor for computation speed, and detailed 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models that attempt to simulate the entire solar corona with a degree of physical rigor, but require large amounts of computation. The Field Line Universal relaXer, an open-source numerical code that implements the “fluxon” semi-Lagrangian approach to MHD modeling, provides an intermediate approach between these two general classes. In particular, the fluxon approach to MHD describes the magnetic field through discrete analogs of magnetic field lines, relaxing these structures to a stationary state of force balance. In this work we introduce a 1D solar wind solution along each field line, providing an ensemble of solutions that are interpolated back onto a uniform grid at an outer boundary surface. This provides advantages in physical rigor over heuristic semianalytic techniques, and in computational efficiency over full 3D MHD techniques. Here we describe the underlying methodology and the FLUXPipe modeling pipeline process.

在本研究中，我们研究了标量场膨胀模型与高斯-邦内特项耦合形成原始黑洞的机制。通过耦合函数增强了曲率扰动，导致原始黑洞的形成并产生了可探测的次级引力波。我们确定了三组不同的势函数参数，形式为ϕ的1/3次方、ϕ的2/5次方和ϕ的2/3次方。通过调整模型参数，在超缓慢滚动阶段减速充气，并增强了曲率扰动。我们的计算预测了与LIGO-Virgo观测数据相符合的质量为10^30kg的原始黑洞的形成。此外，我们还发现质量分别约为10^19kg和10^21kg的原始黑洞，可以解释OGLE数据中的超短时间微引力透镜事件。此外，我们提出的机制可能导致在10^15kg和10^16kg的质量尺度上形成原始黑洞，贡献了宇宙中大约99%的暗物质。我们还研究了我们模型中次级引力波的产生。在所有模型情况下，次级引力波的密度参数都呈现出与引力波探测器灵敏度曲线相交的尖峰，为验证我们的发现提供了一种手段。我们的数值结果展示了次级引力波频谱随频率的幂律行为，具体为f的3/2次方。此外，在红外区域，即f << fc时，幂指数采用对数依赖形式，特别是f的2/3次方。

In this study, we investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in a scalar field inflationary model coupled to the Gauss–Bonnet term with fractional power-law potentials. The coupling function enhances the curvature perturbations, then results in the generation of PBHs and detectable secondary gravitational waves (GWs). We identify three separate sets of parameters for the potential functions of the form ϕ1/3, ϕ2/5, and ϕ2/3. By adjusting the model parameters, we decelerate the inflaton during the ultra-slow-roll phase and enhance curvature perturbations. Our calculations predict the formation of PBHs with masses of , which are compatible with LIGO-Virgo observational data. Additionally, we find PBHs with masses around and , which can explain ultra-short-timescale microlensing events in OGLE data. Furthermore, our proposed mechanism could lead to the formation of PBHs in mass scales around and , contributing to approximately 99% of the dark matter in the Universe. We also study the production of secondary GWs in our model. In all cases of the model, the density parameter of secondary GWs exhibits peaks that intersect the sensitivity curves of GW detectors, providing a means to verify our findings using data of these detectors. Our numerical results demonstrate a power-law behavior for the spectra of with respect to frequency, given by . Additionally, in the infrared regime where f ≪ fc, the power index takes a log-dependent form, specifically .

<div> 关键词: 准周期性喷发，X射线，超大质量黑洞，EMRI，射电观测<br />
总结: <br />
研究报告了eRO-QPE1的长期光变趋势，以及QPE的消失和重新出现，伴随着变暗和降温。研究还观察到射电观测的非检测，以及QPE定时残差的可能调制。结果暂时支持EMRI-盘碰撞模型推动QPE，并且证明了QPE的时序调制可以联合约束超大质量黑洞自旋和盘密度分布。 <br /> <div>
Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are luminous X-ray outbursts recurring on hour timescales, observed from the nuclei of a growing handful of nearby low-mass galaxies. Their physical origin is still debated, and usually modeled as (a) accretion disk instabilities or (b) interaction of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) with a lower mass companion in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI). EMRI models can be tested with several predictions related to the short- and long-term behavior of QPEs. In this study, we report on the ongoing 3.5 yr NICER and XMM-Newton monitoring campaign of eRO-QPE1, which is known to exhibit erratic QPEs that have been challenging for the simplest EMRI models to explain. We report (1) complex, non-monotonic evolution in the long-term trends of QPE energy output and inferred emitting area; (2) the disappearance of the QPEs (within NICER detectability) in 2023 October, and then the reappearance by 2024 January at a luminosity of ∼100× fainter (and temperature of ∼3× cooler) than the initial discovery; (3) radio non-detections with MeerKAT and Very Large Array observations partly contemporaneous with our NICER campaign (though not during outbursts); and (4) the presence of a possible ∼6 day modulation of the QPE timing residuals, which aligns with the expected nodal precession timescale of the underlying accretion disk. Our results tentatively support EMRI–disk collision models powering the QPEs, and we demonstrate that the timing modulation of QPEs may be used to jointly constrain the SMBH spin and disk density profile.

Thanks to the precise astrometric measurements of proper motions by the Gaia mission, a new tidal stellar stream has been discovered in the northern hemisphere. The distribution of star count shows that the stream is approximately 80° long and 1.°70 wide. Observations of 21 member stars, including 14 RR Lyrae stars, indicate that the stream has an eccentric and retrograde orbit with e = 0.58. The low metallicity, high total energy, and large angular momentum suggest that it is associated with the merging event Sequoia. This discovery suggests the possibility of finding more substructures with high eccentricity orbits, even in the inner halo.

<title>A Relook at the Black Hole Binary Candidate J1328+2752 with VLBI</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present multiband follow-up observations of the supermassive binary black hole (BBH) candidate and misaligned double–double radio galaxy, J1328+2752. To investigate its parsec-scale structure, we have carried out observations with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and the European Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) Network. Additionally, we have obtained optical spectroscopic observations with the 3.6 m Devasthal Optical Telescope. Within 3.5 yr of our previous VLBI observations, the central parsec-scale radio structure of J1328+2752 has changed from a double component to a single central component and its flux density has increased by a factor of 3 in the 5 GHz VLBA observations. The new radio component is largely unresolved at 3, 5, and 8 GHz. The multifrequency radio data shows a convex-shaped spectrum for this unresolved component. The turnover frequency is at ∼3 GHz. While the total intensity image does not reveal any details, a super-resolved VLBA 5 and 8 GHz spectral index image does indicate the presence of two components at a separation of ∼4.2 pc with spectral indices −0.5 ± 0.3 and −0.9 ± 0.3. We have not observed a simultaneous change in the optical line profiles or intensities over the past few years. The radio structure, the variation of the flux density, and spectral shape can potentially be consistent both with the signature of a young radio source or a BBH at the center of J1328+2752.

<title>The Role of a Neutron Component in the Photospheric Emission of Long-duration Gamma-Ray Burst Jets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), thought to be produced during core-collapse supernovae, may have a prominent neutron component in the outflow material. If present, neutrons can change how photons scatter in the outflow by reducing its opacity, thereby allowing the photons to decouple sooner than if there were no neutrons present. Understanding the details of this process could therefore allow us to probe the central engine of LGRBs, which is otherwise hidden. Here, we present results of the photospheric emission from an LGRB jet, using a combination of relativistic hydrodynamic simulations and radiative transfer postprocessing using Monte Carlo radiation transfer code. We control the size of the neutron component in the jet material by varying the equilibrium electron fraction Ye, and we find that the presence of neutrons in the GRB fireball affects the Band parameters α and E0, while the picture with the β parameter is less clear. In particular, the break energy E0 is shifted to higher energies. Additionally, we find that increasing the size of the neutron component also increases the total radiated energy of the outflow across multiple viewing angles. Our results not only shed light on LGRBs but are also relevant to short-duration gamma-ray bursts associated with binary neutron star mergers due to the likelihood of a prominent neutron component in such systems.

<title>COMAP Early Science. VIII. A Joint Stacking Analysis with eBOSS Quasars</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a new upper limit on the cosmic molecular gas density at z = 2.4–3.4 obtained using the first year of observations from the CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP). COMAP data cubes are stacked on the 3D positions of 243 quasars selected from the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) catalog, yielding a 95% upper limit for flux from CO(1–0) line emission of 0.129 Jy km s−1. Depending on the balance of the emission between the quasar host and its environment, this value can be interpreted as an average CO line luminosity of eBOSS quasars of ≤1.26 × 1011 K km pc2 s−1, or an average molecular gas density in regions of the Universe containing a quasar of ≤1.52 × 108M⊙ cMpc−3. The upper limit falls among CO line luminosities obtained from individually targeted quasars in the COMAP redshift range, and the value is comparable to upper limits obtained from other line intensity mapping (LIM) surveys and their joint analyses. Further, we forecast the values obtainable with the COMAP/eBOSS stack after the full 5 yr COMAP Pathfinder survey. We predict that a detection is probable with this method, depending on the CO properties of the quasar sample. Based on the achieved sensitivity, we believe that this technique of stacking LIM data on the positions of traditional galaxy or quasar catalogs is extremely promising, both as a technique for investigating large galaxy catalogs efficiently at high redshift and as a technique for bolstering the sensitivity of LIM experiments, even with a fraction of their total expected survey data.

<title>Double Power-law Formation by Sequential Particle Acceleration</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Spectral double power laws are common in solar high-energy phenomena such as flares and interplanetary energetic-electron events. However, the physical mechanism that produces the changes in power-law index within a single spectrum is unclear. We developed a fully analytical method of forming single power-law spectra from sequential acceleration of particles orbiting inside and hopping between simulated large-scale magnetic islands formed by flare reconnection. Here, we extend the analytical method to the formation of double power-law spectra by assuming sequential acceleration in two successive regions with different acceleration and particle-transport rates. The resulting spectral distribution is continuous and smooth, with a flattening at low energies, two power-law regions at mid-energies, and a steep rollover at high energies. The model provides analytical expressions for the spectral indices, all energy breaks, and normalization constants as functions of just three physical parameters of each acceleration region: (1) the energy gain in each accelerator, (2) the percentage of particles transferred between accelerators, and (3) the number of accelerators visited. One of the most salient predictions of our work is that the spectral index at high (low) energies is determined by the parameters of the first “seed” (second) acceleration region. By constructing the spectral distribution through an iterative analytical process, the evolution toward a double power law is easily characterized and explained. Our analytical model provides tools to interpret space- and ground-based observations from RHESSI, FOXSI, NuSTAR, Solar Orbiter/STIX, EOVSA, and future high-energy missions.

<title>Tropical Cyclones on Tidally Locked Rocky Planets: Dependence on Rotation Period</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Tropical cyclones occur over the Earth’s tropical oceans, with characteristic genesis regions and tracks tied to the warm ocean surface that provide energy to sustain these storms. The study of tropical cyclogenesis and evolution on Earth has led to the development of environmental favorability metrics that predict the strength of potential storms from the local background climate state. Simulations of the gamut of transiting terrestrial exoplanets orbiting late-type stars may offer a test of this Earth-based understanding of tropical cyclogenesis. Previous work has demonstrated that tropical cyclones are likely to form on tidally locked terrestrial exoplanets with intermediate rotation periods of ∼8–10 days. In this study, we test these expectations using ExoCAM simulations with both a sufficient horizontal resolution of 0.°47 × 0.°63 required to permit tropical cyclogenesis along with a thermodynamically active slab ocean. We conduct simulations of tidally locked and ocean-covered Earth-sized planets orbiting late-type M dwarf stars with varying rotation periods from 4–16 days in order to cross the predicted maximum in tropical cyclogenesis. We track tropical cyclones that form in each simulation and assess their location of maximum wind, evolution, and maximum wind speeds. We compare the resulting tropical cyclone locations and strengths to predictions based on environmental favorability metrics, finding good agreement between Earth-based metrics and our simulated storms with a local maximum in both tropical cyclone frequency and intensity at a rotation period of 8 days. Our results suggest that environmental favorability metrics used for tropical cyclones on Earth may also be applicable to temperate tidally locked Earth-sized rocky exoplanets with abundant surface liquid water.

<title>Sensitivity of Cosmological Parameter Estimation to Nonlinear Prescription from Cosmic Shear</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Several ongoing and upcoming large-scale structure surveys aim to explore the nonlinear regime of structure formation with high precision. Making reliable cosmological inferences from these observations necessitates precise theoretical modeling of the mildly nonlinear regime. In this work we explore how the choice of nonlinear prescription would impact parameter estimation from cosmic shear measurements for a Euclid-like survey. Specifically, we employ two different nonlinear prescriptions of halofit and the Effective Field Theory of the Large Scale Structure and compare their measurements for the three different cosmological scenarios of ΛCDM, wCDM, and (w0, wa) CDM. We also investigate the impact of different nonlinear cutoff schemes on parameter estimation. We find that the predicted errors on most parameters shrink considerably as smaller scales are included in the analysis, with the amount depending on the nonlinear prescription and the cutoff scheme used. We use predictions from the halofit model to analyze the mock data from DarkSky N-body simulations and quantify the parameter bias introduced in the measurements due to the choice of nonlinear prescription. We observe that σ8 and ns have the largest measurement bias induced by inaccuracies of the halofit model.

Galaxy interactions and mergers can enhance or reduce star formation, but a complete understanding of the involved processes is still lacking. The effect of dwarf galaxy mergers is even less clear than their massive counterpart. We present a study on a dwarf merger remnant in the Virgo cluster, VCC322, which might form a triple system with VCC334 and VCC319. We identify a prominent long and straight tail-like substructure that has a size comparable to its host galaxy VCC322. By comparing the color–color (g − r versus r − H) distribution with simple stellar population models, we infer that the metallicity and stellar age of this tail are Z⋆ ∼ 0.02 Z⊙ and t⋆ ∼ 10 Gyr, respectively. In VCC319, we find a sign of isophotal twisting. This suggests that VCC319 may be subject to tidal interaction. An analysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey optical spectra of VCC322 indicates mass- and light-weighted ages of about 109.8 yr and 107.5 yr, respectively, indicating an ongoing star formation activity. However, the star formation in VCC322 seems suppressed when compared to other star-forming dwarfs of comparable stellar masses. Our finding of shock excitation of optical emission lines indicates that interaction-induced shock may contribute to the heating of cold gas and suppression of star formation.

<title>Generalized Coronal Loop Scaling Laws and Their Implication for Turbulence in Solar Active Region Loops</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3031</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3031</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent coronal loop modeling has emphasized the importance of combining both Coulomb collisions and turbulent scattering to characterize field-aligned thermal conduction, which invokes a hybrid loop model. In this work, we generalize the hybrid model by incorporating a nonuniform heating and cross section that are both formulated by a power-law function of temperature. Based on the hybrid model solutions, we construct scaling laws that relate loop-top temperature (Ta) and heating rate (Ha) to other loop parameters. It is found that the loop-top properties for turbulent loops are additionally power-law functions of the turbulent mean free path (λT), with the functional forms varying from situation to situation, depending on the specification of the heating and/or areal parameters. More importantly, both a sufficiently footpoint-concentrated heating and a cross-sectional expansion with height can effectively weaken (strengthen) the negative (positive) power-law dependence of Ta (Ha) on λT. The reason lies in a notable reduction of heat flux by footpoint heating and/or cross-sectional expansion in the turbulence-dominated coronal part, where turbulent scattering introduces a much weaker dependence of the conduction coefficient on temperature. In this region, therefore, the reduction of the heat flux predominately relies on a backward flattening of the temperature gradient. Through numerical modeling that incorporates more realistic conditions, this scenario is further consolidated. Our results have important implications for solar active region (AR) loops. With the factors of nonuniform heating and cross section taken into account, AR loops can bear relatively stronger turbulence while still keeping a physically reasonable temperature for nonflaring loops.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In a previous study, Huang et al. used the Alfvén Wave Solar atmosphere Model, one of the widely used solar wind models in the community, driven by ADAPT-GONG magnetograms to simulate the solar wind in the last solar cycle and found that the optimal Poynting flux parameter can be estimated from either the open field area or the average unsigned radial component of the magnetic field in the open field regions. It was also found that the average energy deposition rate (Poynting flux) in the open field regions is approximately constant. In the current study, we expand the previous work by using GONG magnetograms to simulate the solar wind for the same Carrington rotations and determine if the results are similar to the ones obtained with ADAPT-GONG magnetograms. Our results indicate that similar correlations can be obtained from the GONG maps. Moreover, we report that ADAPT-GONG magnetograms can consistently provide better comparisons with 1 au solar wind observations than GONG magnetograms, based on the best simulations selected by the minimum of the average curve distance for the solar wind speed and density.

<br />SN 2022joj 是一颗附近的特殊Ia型超新星，其快速衰减率(Δm15，B = 1.4 mag)。初期表现为极端红色，随后出现蓝移的光谱特性，最终逐渐趋向典型SNe Ia。根据观测结果，SN 2022joj与白矮星质量约1 M⊙和0.01至0.05 M⊙之间的薄He壳层的双重爆炸模型有较强的一致性。此外，该超新星的星云光谱与预期的双重爆炸模型有所偏差，产生了强烈的[Fe iii]发射。然而，随着He壳层变薄，这些超新星开始变得更像典型的SNe Ia，这引发了触发大多数SNe Ia的可能机制，并且强调了观测超新星的早期重要性。 <br /><br />总结:  SN 2022joj 是一颗特殊的Ia型超新星，其具有快速衰减率和异常的红色光谱特性。观测结果与双重爆炸模型相吻合，但星云光谱与预期有所偏差，这可能暗示了触发大多数SNe Ia的机制并强调了早期观测的重要性。 <div>
We present photometric and spectroscopic data for SN 2022joj, a nearby peculiar Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) with a fast decline rate (Δm15,B = 1.4 mag). SN 2022joj shows exceedingly red colors, with a value of approximately B − V ≈ 1.1 mag during its initial stages, beginning from 11 days before maximum brightness. As it evolves, the flux shifts toward the blue end of the spectrum, approaching B − V ≈ 0 mag around maximum light. Furthermore, at maximum light and beyond, the photometry is consistent with that of typical SNe Ia. This unusual behavior extends to its spectral characteristics, which initially displayed a red spectrum and later evolved to exhibit greater consistency with typical SNe Ia. Spectroscopically, we find strong agreement between SN 2022joj and double detonation models with white dwarf masses of around 1 M⊙ and a thin He shell between 0.01 and 0.05 M⊙. Moreover, the early red colors are explained by line-blanketing absorption from iron peak elements created by the double detonation scenario in similar mass ranges. The nebular spectra in SN 2022joj deviate from expectations for double detonation, as we observe strong [Fe iii] emission instead of [Ca ii] lines as anticipated, though this is not as robust a prediction as early red colors and spectra. The fact that as He shells get thinner these SNe start to look more like normal SNe Ia raises the possibility that this is the triggering mechanism for the majority of SNe Ia, though evidence would be missed if the SNe are not observed early enough.

The ever-growing sample of observed supernovae (SNe) enhances our capacity for comprehensive SN population studies, providing a richer data set for understanding the diverse characteristics of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and possibly those of their progenitors. Here, we present a data-driven analysis of observed SN Ia photometric light curves collected in the Open Supernova Catalog. Where available, we add the environmental information from the host galaxy. We focus on identifying subclasses of SNe Ia without imposing the predefined subclasses found in the literature to date. To do so, we employ an implicit rank-minimizing autoencoder neural network for developing low-dimensional data representations, providing a compact representation of the SN light-curve diversity. When we analyze light curves alone, we find that one of our resulting latent variables is strongly correlated with redshift, allowing us to approximately “de-redshift” the other latent variables describing each event. After doing so, we find that three of our latent variables account for ∼95% of the variance in our sample, and provide a natural separation between 91T and 91bg thermonuclear SNe. Of note, the 02cx subclass is not unambiguously delineated from the 91bg sample in our results, nor do either the overluminous 91T or the underluminous 91bg/02cx samples form a clearly distinct population from the broader sample of “other” SN Ia events. We identify the physical characteristics of SN light curves that best distinguish SNe 91T from SNe 91bg and 02cx, and discuss prospects for future refinements and applications to other classes of SNe as well as other transients.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究探讨了引力波和星系调查之间的协同作用，以共同限制宇宙学和引力波种群参数。研究引入了CHIMERA，这是一种新颖的引力波宇宙学代码，结合了紧凑双子融合体的种群特性和星系目录的信息。研究发现，在LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O4和O5观测运行的代表性情景中，利用光谱或光度红移测量的星系目录，可以实现对H0的百分之一级测量。此外，文章还强调了未来获得光谱星系目录的重要性，以最大化引力波宇宙学的科学收益。 <div>
With the growing number of gravitational wave (GW) detections and the advent of large galaxy redshift surveys, a new era in cosmology is emerging. This study explores the synergies between GWs and galaxy surveys to jointly constrain cosmological and GW population parameters. We introduce CHIMERA, a novel code for GW cosmology combining information from the population properties of compact binary mergers and galaxy catalogs. We study constraints for scenarios representative of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O4 and O5 observing runs, assuming to have a complete catalog of potential host galaxies with either spectroscopic or photometric redshift measurements. We find that a percent-level measurement of H0 could be achieved with the best 100 binary black holes (BBHs) in O5 using a spectroscopic galaxy catalog. In this case, the intrinsic correlation that exists between H0 and the BBH population mass scales is broken. Instead, by using a photometric catalog the accuracy is degraded up to a factor of ∼9, leaving a significant correlation between H0 and the mass scales that must be carefully modeled to avoid bias. Interestingly, we find that using spectroscopic redshift measurements in the O4 configuration yields a better constraint on H0 compared to the O5 configuration with photometric measurements. In view of the wealth of GW data that will be available in the future, we argue the importance of obtaining spectroscopic galaxy catalogs to maximize the scientific return of GW cosmology.

<div> PDS 70, massive planets, protoplanetary disk, CO isotopologue, gas structure

PDS 70是一个拥有两颗质量巨大的行星的原行星盘，其倾斜的盘面结构为直接探测行星盘垂直气体结构提供了独特的机会。采用高空间分辨率观测了一系列CO同位素线和HCO+J = 4−3，从盘面气体结构(由12CO描绘)到接近盘面(由含量较少的同位素和HCO+描绘)绘制了完整的二维（r，z）盘面结构。在PDS 70盘面上，12CO追踪高度z/r约为0.3，13CO位于z/r约为0.1，C18O起源于盘面或附近。HCO+的表面出现在z/r约为0.2，是为数不多的在盘上得到高保真度约束的非CO发射表面之一。在12CO J = 3−2线中，我们解析了一个在空洞壁上高度的垂直下降和急剧上升，使得PDS 70成为第一个直接在发射线高度上看到这种效应的过渡盘。在外盘中，PDS 70的CO发射高度似乎对其恒星质量和盘尺寸来说是典型的，并且并不受到两个内部嵌入的行星的实质性改变。通过结合CO同位素和HCO+线，我们得出了二维气体温度结构，并估算出一个约为56-85天文单位的盘面CO雪线。这意味着PDS 70b和70c都位于CO雪线内部，并且很可能正在吸积具有高C/O比约为1.0的气体，这为未来从JWST（詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜）等方面测量行星大气和正确地建模它们的形成历史提供了背景。 <br /><br />总结: PDS 70拥有两颗质量巨大的行星而且其盘面结构倾斜，通过CO同位素和HCO+线观测得出了该行星盘的二维气体温度结构，估算出了盘面CO雪线的位置，在盘中心拥有高C/O比的气体，这为未来行星大气测量和形成历史建模提供了重要背景。 <div>
PDS 70 hosts two massive, still-accreting planets and the inclined orientation of its protoplanetary disk presents a unique opportunity to directly probe the vertical gas structure of a planet-hosting disk. Here, we use high-spatial-resolution (≈0.″1; 10 au) observations in a set of CO isotopologue lines and HCO+J = 4−3 to map the full 2D (r, z) disk structure from the disk atmosphere, as traced by 12CO, to closer to the midplane, as probed by less abundant isotopologues and HCO+. In the PDS 70 disk, 12CO traces a height of z/r ≈ 0.3, 13CO is found at z/r ≈ 0.1, and C18O originates at, or near, the midplane. The HCO+ surface arises from z/r ≈ 0.2 and is one of the few non-CO emission surfaces constrained with high-fidelity in disks to date. In the 12CO J = 3−2 line, we resolve a vertical dip and steep rise in height at the cavity wall, making PDS 70 the first transition disk where this effect is directly seen in line-emitting heights. In the outer disk, the CO emission heights of PDS 70 appear typical for its stellar mass and disk size and are not substantially altered by the two inner embedded planets. By combining CO isotopologue and HCO+ lines, we derive the 2D gas temperature structure and estimate a midplane CO snowline of ≈ 56–85 au. This implies that both PDS 70b and 70c are located interior to the CO snowline and are likely accreting gas with a high C/O ratio of ≈ 1.0, which provides context for future planetary atmospheric measurements from, e.g., JWST, and for properly modeling their formation histories.

MAXI J1820+070在2018年爆发期间进行了多波段光谱分析，利用AstroSat远紫外、软X射线和硬X射线数据，以及Las Cumbres Observatory和NICER的（准）同时光学和X射线数据。在软态中，研究发现软X射线和UV/光学存在过量成分，而硬态中光学/UV也有显著过量成分，表明外圆盘中存在更强的重新辐射。通过具体的光谱拟合，确定了BH自旋参数以及盘的密度和内盘结构。硬态中还观察到了两个成分的冕，并分析了它们所产生的反射特征。<br /><br />总结: <div>
We present a comprehensive multiwavelength spectral analysis of the black hole (BH) X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 during its 2018 outburst, utilizing AstroSat far-UV, soft X-ray, and hard X-ray data, along with (quasi-)simultaneous optical and X-ray data from the Las Cumbres Observatory and NICER, respectively. In the soft state, we detect soft X-ray and UV/optical excess components over and above the intrinsic accretion disk emission (kTin ∼ 0.58 keV) and a steep X-ray power-law component. The soft X-ray excess is consistent with a high-temperature blackbody (kT ∼ 0.79 keV), while the UV/optical excess is described by UV emission lines and two low-temperature blackbody components (kT ∼ 3.87 and ∼0.75 eV). Employing continuum spectral fitting, we determine the BH spin parameter (a = 0.77 ± 0.21), using the jet inclination angle of 64° ± 5° and a mass spanning 5–10 M☉. In the hard state (HS), we observe a significantly enhanced optical/UV excess component, indicating a stronger reprocessed emission in the outer disk. Broadband X-ray spectroscopy in the HS reveals a two-component corona, each associated with its reflection component, in addition to the disk emission (kTin ∼ 0.19 keV). The softer coronal component dominates the bolometric X-ray luminosity and produces broader relativistic reflection features, while the harder component gets reflected far from the inner disk, yielding narrow reflection features. Furthermore, our analysis in the HS suggests a substantial truncation of the inner disk (≳51 gravitational radii) and a high disk density (∼1020 cm−3).

<div> quiescent galaxies, JWST, size, stellar mass, redshift
总结:
本研究利用James Webb太空望远镜(NIRCam)对z ≥ 3的静止星系的光学形态进行了系统研究。通过UVJ颜色或NUVUVJ颜色选择样本，重点关注了26个zphot介于2.8和4.6之间的静止星系，利用NIRCam图像拟合Sérsic模型约束它们的大小。我们发现观测波长与大小之间呈负相关，并通过多波段的大小测量推导了它们在0.5微米处的大小。在z ≥ 3时期，我们的静止星系表现出了在0.5微米处的大小与恒星质量之间显著的相关性。我们的分析结果显示，相较于较低红移时期，我们的大小-恒星质量关系较低，当M⋆ = 5 × 1010M⊙时振幅约为0.6千秒差距。样本主要包括具有类似球状结构的星系，其平均Sérsic指数和轴比分别约为n ∼ 3-4和q ∼ 0.6-0.8。另一方面，我们观察到低Sérsic指数星系的比例随着红移的增加而增加，这表明3 < z < 5可能是形态转变开始的时期，出现了一定比例的非常明显的扁盘状已停止形成星系。 <div>
We present the results of a systematic study of the rest-frame optical morphology of quiescent galaxies at z ≥ 3 using the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Based on a sample selected by UVJ color or NUVUVJ color, we focus on 26 quiescent galaxies with at 2.8 < zphot < 4.6 with publicly available JWST data. Their sizes are constrained by fitting the Sérsic profile to all available NIRCam images. We see a negative correlation between the observed wavelength and the size and derive their size at the rest frame 0.5 μm using size measurements in multiple bands. Our quiescent galaxies show a significant correlation between the rest-frame 0.5 μm size and the stellar mass at z ≥ 3. The analytical fit for them at implies that our size–stellar mass relations are below those at lower redshifts, with the amplitude of ∼0.6 kpc at M⋆ = 5 × 1010M⊙. This value agrees with the extrapolation of the size evolution of quiescent galaxies at z < 3 in the literature, implying that the size of quiescent galaxies increases monotonically from z ∼ 3–5. Our sample mainly comprises galaxies with bulge-like structures according to their median Sérsic index and axis ratio of n ∼ 3–4 and q ∼ 0.6–0.8, respectively. On the other hand, there is a trend of increasing fraction of galaxies with low Sérsic index at higher redshift, suggesting 3 < z < 5 might be the epoch of onset of morphological transformation with a fraction of very notable disky quenched galaxies.

<br />总结: Parker Solar Probe和Solar Orbiter的数据被用于进行太阳风模拟研究，结果显示AFT和ADAPT模型在不同位置的太阳风特性模拟效果相似，但在SolO和地球位置需要改进。另外，研究追踪了SolO位置的场线，发现了活跃区出流迹象。 <div>
The launches of Parker Solar Probe (Parker) and Solar Orbiter (SolO) are enabling a new era of solar wind studies that track the solar wind from its origin at the photosphere, through the corona, to multiple vantage points in the inner heliosphere. A key ingredient for these models is the input photospheric magnetic field map that provides the boundary condition for the coronal portion of many heliospheric models. In this paper, we perform steady-state, data-driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the solar wind during Carrington rotation 2258 with the Grid GAMERA model. We use the ADAPT and AFT flux transport models and quantitatively assess how well each model matches in situ measurements from Parker, SolO, and Earth. We find that both models reproduce the magnetic field components at Parker quantitatively well. At SolO and Earth, the magnetic field is reproduced relatively well, though not as well as at Parker, and the density is reproduced extremely poorly. The velocity is overpredicted at Parker, but not at SolO or Earth, hinting that the Wang–Sheeley–Arge (WSA) relation, fine-tuned for Earth, misses the deceleration of the solar wind near the Sun. We conclude that AFT performs quantitatively similarly to ADAPT in all cases, and that both models are comparable to a purely WSA heliospheric treatment with no MHD component. Finally, we trace field lines from SolO back to an active region outflow that was observed by Hinode/EIS, and which shows evidence of elevated charge state ratios.

<div> HLXs, extragalactic, X-ray sources, intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), Hubble Space Telescope imaging
<br /><br />总结:
研究团队系统性地建立了HLX候选样本，利用哈勃太空望远镜的成像资料进行了首次统一的HLX恒星核群体研究，得出至少88%的HLX可能是来自外部星系的具有大质量黑洞的情况。50%的样本通过HST成像揭示了将HLX与宿主星系连接起来的特征，强烈表明这些情况并非背景/前景的污染可能性。根据活跃星系核的质量比例关系，估计29%的污染率后，我们的样本中多达60%可能与IMBH相关。与已知的HLX类似，X射线亮度相对于其恒星核质量系统性升高，可能是因为合并驱动的吸积率增强。最小质量的恒星核更可能出现在更大的核偏移处，并更可能在宿主星系的晕中漂泊。HLX的星系占据率约为10^-2，并且与质量呈强烈的反比关系。多达12%的HLX候选情况可能与球状星团内形成或异常亮X射线双星情况一致。 <div>
Hyper-luminous X-ray sources (HLXs) are extragalactic off-nuclear X-ray sources with luminosities exceeding the theoretical limit for accretion onto stellar-mass compact objects. Many HLXs may represent intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) deposited in galaxy halos through mergers, and the properties of the stellar cores surrounding HLXs provide powerful constraints on this scenario. Therefore, we have systematically built the largest sample of HLX candidates with archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging (24) for the first uniform population study of HLX stellar cores down to low masses. Based on their host galaxy redshifts, at least 21 (88%) have stellar core masses ≥ 107M⊙ and hence are consistent with accretion onto massive black holes from external galaxies. In 50% of the sample, the HST imaging reveals features connecting the HLXs with their host galaxies, strongly suggesting against the background/foreground contaminant possibility in these cases. Assuming a mass scaling relation for active galactic nuclei and accounting for an estimated contamination fraction of 29%, up to ∼60% of our sample may be associated with IMBHs. Similar to previously known HLXs, the X-ray luminosities are systematically elevated relative to their stellar core masses, possibly from merger-driven accretion rate enhancements. The least massive stellar cores are preferentially found at larger nuclear offsets and are more likely to remain wandering in their host galaxy halos. The HLX galaxy occupation fraction is ∼ 10−2 and has a strong inverse mass dependence. Up to three of the HLX candidates (12%) are potentially consistent with formation within globular clusters or with exceptionally luminous X-ray binaries.

总结: 
KSP-OT-201712a是一颗特殊的矮新星，表现出在停滞期间的爆发现象，具有罕见的双峰Hα发射线和弱He I发射线。该系统的次星温度高达4570K，表明它开始质量传递时约为主序星寿命的93%。由此推测该系统随着质量传递的进化将发生巨大的质量转移。最终，在氢包层耗尽之前，将演化成为氦新星或AM CVn系统，甚至在演化的终点会爆发成为Ia型超新星。  <br /><br /> <div>
We present the discovery of a peculiar dwarf nova KSP-OT-201712a using high-cadence, multicolor observations made with the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network. KSP-OT-201712a exhibits a rare presence of outbursts during standstills, as well as strong Hα emission for a dwarf nova below the period minimum with an orbital period of 58.75 ± 0.02 minutes. The outburst cycles are ∼6.6 days within standstills but increase to ∼15 days outside of them. Both B − V and V − I colors become bluer and redder as the outburst luminosities increase and decrease, respectively, for the outburst within standstill, while they evolve in the opposite directions outside of the standstills. The presence of strong double-peaked Hα and weak He i emission lines with He/H flux ratio of 0.27, together with absorption lines of Mg b and Na D in the source, leads to the estimation Teff ≃ 4570 ± 40 K, [Fe/H] ≃ 0.06 ± 0.15 dex, and log g ≃ 4.5 ± 0.1 for its secondary. KSP-OT-201712a is the second He-deficient dwarf nova below the period minimum, while the temperature of the secondary is measured for the first time in such objects. We identify it to be an ER UMa-type dwarf nova, suggesting that the evolution of dwarf novae across the period minimum is accompanied by large mass transfers. The high temperature of the secondary indicates that the system started its mass transfer when the secondary was about 93% of its main-sequence age. The system will evolve to a helium cataclysmic variable or to AM CVn once its hydrogen envelope is exhausted before it explodes as a Type Ia supernova.

The growth of supermassive black holes is strongly linked to their galaxies. It has been shown that the population mean black hole accretion rate ( ) primarily correlates with the galaxy stellar mass (M⋆) and redshift for the general galaxy population. This work aims to provide the best measurements of as a function of M⋆ and redshift over ranges of 109.5 < M⋆ < 1012M⊙ and z < 4. We compile an unprecedentedly large sample with 8000 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and 1.3 million normal galaxies from nine high-quality survey fields following a wedding cake design. We further develop a semiparametric Bayesian method that can reasonably estimate and the corresponding uncertainties, even for sparsely populated regions in the parameter space. is constrained by X-ray surveys sampling the AGN accretion power and UV-to-infrared multiwavelength surveys sampling the galaxy population. Our results can independently predict the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) from the galaxy stellar mass function (SMF), and the prediction is consistent with the observed XLF. We also try adding external constraints from the observed SMF and XLF. We further measure for star-forming and quiescent galaxies and show that star-forming is generally larger than or at least comparable to the quiescent .

Diatomic molecules phosphorus monoxide (PO) and phosphorus mononitride (PN) are the main reservoirs of gas-phase phosphorus in interstellar and circumstellar environments, indicating the possibility of forming new phosphorus-bearing molecules through reactions with other interstellar species. To explore the astrochemistry of PO and PN, new simple phosphorus-bearing molecules [O, C, N, P] and [2O, C, N, P] were generated in the gas phase and isolated in cryogenic matrices for characterization with matrix-isolation IR and UV/vis spectroscopy in combination with calculations at the CCSD(T)-F12a/VTZ-F12 level of theory. In an inert argon matrix, OPCN isomerizes to OPNC upon UV-light irradiation at 365 nm, followed by successive isomerizations to PNCO and POCN with concomitant dissociation to diatomic PN and CO under further irradiation at 193 nm. By analogy, the isomerization of O2PCN to O2PNC and OPNCO followed by fragmentation to OPN/CO and PN/CO2 occurs in the matrix upon irradiation at 193 nm. In a chemically active CO ice, the photolytic reaction of OPCN with CO yields CO2 and PCN, and O2PCN reacts with CO by forming OPCN and CO2, in which the photochemical networks for these P-bearing species linking the astrochemically important PN and PO have been proposed. The experimental identification of these phosphorus-bearing molecules is supported by quantum chemical calculations, and the spectroscopic data may aid in their detection in the interstellar and circumstellar medium.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of the Type IIn supernova (SN) 2021qqp. Its unusual light curve is marked by a long precursor for ≈300 days, a rapid increase in brightness for ≈60 days, and then a sharp increase of ≈1.6 mag in only a few days to a first peak of Mr ≈ −19.5 mag. The light curve then declines rapidly until it rebrightens to a second distinct peak of Mr ≈ −17.3 mag centered at ≈335 days after the first peak. The spectra are dominated by Balmer lines with a complex morphology, including a narrow component with a width of ≈1300 km s−1 (first peak) and ≈2500 km s−1 (second peak) that we associate with the circumstellar medium (CSM) and a P Cygni component with an absorption velocity of ≈8500 km s−1 (first peak) and ≈5600 km s−1 (second peak) that we associate with the SN–CSM interaction shell. Using the luminosity and velocity evolution, we construct a flexible analytical model, finding two significant mass-loss episodes with peak mass loss rates of ≈10 and ≈5 M⊙ yr−1 about 0.8 and 2 yr before explosion, respectively, with a total CSM mass of ≈2–4 M⊙. We show that the most recent mass-loss episode could explain the precursor for the year preceding the explosion. The SN ejecta mass is constrained to be ≈5–30 M⊙ for an explosion energy of ≈(3–10) × 1051 erg. We discuss eruptive massive stars (luminous blue variable, pulsational pair instability) and an extreme stellar merger with a compact object as possible progenitor channels.

<title>Contribution of γ-Ray Burst Afterglow Emissions to the Isotropic Diffuse γ-Ray Background</title>

The isotropic diffuse γ-ray background (IGRB) serves as a fundamental probe of the evolution of the extreme Universe. Although various astrophysical sources have been proposed as potential contributors to the IGRB, the dominant population is still under debate. γ-ray bursts (GRBs) are among candidate contributors of IGRB, although they are not as frequently discussed as blazars or starburst galaxies. Recent observations of TeV emission from GRB afterglows have provided fresh insights into this subject. This work aims to investigate the potential contribution of GRB afterglows to the IGRB under the standard afterglow model. We carefully examine the influence of each microphysical parameter of the afterglow model on this contribution, with a particular emphasis on the significant role played by the initial kinematic energy. To determine the energy and quantify the contribution of GRB afterglow to IGRBs, we utilize the observed GRB afterglow energy emissions from the Swift X-ray Telescope and Fermi Large Area Telescope instruments. Our calculations, considering the synchrotron self-Compton emission, suggest that GRB afterglows make up less than 10% of the IGRBs. To enhance the precision of our findings, it is crucial to further constrain these parameters by conducting additional ground-based observations of GRB afterglows.

<title>Suprathermal Electron Transport in the Solar Wind: Effects of Coulomb Collisions and Whistler Turbulence</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The nature and radial evolution of solar wind electrons in the suprathermal energy range are studied. A wave–particle interaction tensor and a Fokker–Planck Coulomb collision operator are introduced into the kinetic transport equation describing electron collisions and resonant interactions with whistler waves. The diffusion tensor includes diagonal and off-diagonal terms, and the Coulomb collision operator applies to arbitrary electron velocities describing collisions with both background protons and electrons. The background proton and electron densities and temperatures are based on previous turbulence models that mediate the supersonic solar wind. The electron velocity distribution functions and electron heat flux are calculated. Comparison and analysis of the numerical results with analytical solutions and observations in the near-Sun region are made. The numerical results reproduce well the creation of the sunward electron deficit observed in the near-Sun region. The deficit of the electron velocity distribution function below the core Maxwellian fit at low velocities results from Coulomb collisions, and the excess part above the core Maxwellian fit at high velocities is determined by strong wave–particle interactions.

<title>An Unusual Pulse Shape Change Event in PSR J1713+0747 Observed with the Green Bank Telescope and CHIME</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The millisecond pulsar J1713+0747 underwent a sudden and significant pulse shape change between 2021 April 16 and 17 (MJDs 59320 and 59321). Subsequently, the pulse shape gradually recovered over the course of several months. We report the results of continued multifrequency radio observations of the pulsar made using the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment and the 100 m Green Bank Telescope in a 3 yr period encompassing the shape change event, between 2020 February and 2023 February. As of 2023 February, the pulse shape had returned to a state similar to that seen before the event, but with measurable changes remaining. The amplitude of the shape change and the accompanying time-of-arrival residuals display a strong nonmonotonic dependence on radio frequency, demonstrating that the event is neither a glitch (the effects of which should be independent of radio frequency, ν) nor a change in dispersion measure alone (which would produce a delay proportional to ν−2). However, it does bear some resemblance to the two previous “chromatic timing events” observed in J1713+0747, as well as to a similar event observed in PSR J1643−1224 in 2015.

<title>Velocity Dispersions of Quiescent Galaxies in IllustrisTNG</title>

We examine the central stellar velocity dispersion of subhalos based on IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. The central velocity dispersion is a fundamental observable that links galaxies with their dark matter subhalos. We carefully explore simulated stellar velocity dispersions derived with different definitions to assess possible systematics. We explore the impact of variation in the identification of member stellar particles, the viewing axes, the velocity dispersion computation technique, and simulation resolution. None of these issues impact the velocity dispersion significantly; any systematic uncertainties are smaller than the random error. We examine the stellar mass–velocity dispersion relation as an observational test of the simulations. At fixed stellar mass, the observed velocity dispersions significantly exceed the simulation results. This discrepancy is an interesting benchmark for the IllustrisTNG simulations because the simulations are not explicitly tuned to match this relation. We demonstrate that the stellar velocity dispersion provides measures of the dark matter velocity dispersion and the dark matter subhalo mass.

<title>A Measurement of the Assembly of Milky Way Analogs at Redshifts 0.5 < z < 2 with Resolved Stellar Mass and Star Formation Rate Profiles</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The resolved mass assembly of Milky Way–mass galaxies has been previously studied in simulations, the local Universe, and at higher redshifts using infrared (IR) light profiles. To better characterize the mass assembly of Milky Way analogs (MWAs), as well as their changes in star formation rate (SFR) and color gradients, we construct resolved stellar mass and SFR maps of MWA progenitors selected with abundance matching techniques up to z ∼2 using deep, multiwavelength imaging data from the Hubble Frontier Fields. Our results using stellar mass profiles agree well with previous studies that utilize IR light profiles, showing that the inner 2 kpc of the galaxies and the regions beyond 2 kpc exhibit similar rates of stellar mass growth. This indicates the progenitors of MWAs from z ∼ 2 to the present do not preferentially grow their bulges or their disks. The evolution of the SFR profiles indicates a greater decrease in SFR density in the inner regions versus the outer regions. Sérsic parameters indicate modest growth in the central regions at lower redshifts, perhaps indicating slight bulge growth. However, the Sérsic index does not rise above n ∼ 2 until z < 0.5, meaning these galaxies are still disk-dominated systems. We find that the half-mass radii of the MWA progenitors increase between 1.5 < z < 2, but remain constant at later epochs (z < 1.5). This implies mild bulge growth since z ∼ 2 in MWA progenitors, in line with previous MWA mass assembly studies.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the results of a spectral analysis using simultaneous multifrequency (22, 43, 86, and 129 GHz) very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of the Korean VLBI Network on BL Lac object, Markarian 421. The data we used were obtained from 2013 January to 2018 June. The light curves showed several flux enhancements with global decreases. To separate the variable and quiescent components in the multifrequency light curves for milliarcsecond-scale emission regions, we assumed that the quiescent radiation comes from the emission regions radiating constant optically thin synchrotron emissions (i.e., a minimum flux density with an optically thin spectral index). The quiescent spectrum determined from the multifrequency light curves was subtracted from the total CLEAN flux density, yielding a variable component in the flux that produces the time-dependent spectrum. We found that the observed spectra were flat at 22–43 GHz, and relatively steep at 43–86 GHz, whereas the quiescent-corrected spectra are sometimes quite different from the observed spectra (e.g., sometimes inverted at 22–43 GHz). The quiescent-corrected spectral indices were much more variable than the observed spectral indices. This spectral investigation implies that the quiescent-spectrum correction can significantly affect the multifrequency spectral index of variable compact radio sources such as blazars. Therefore, the synchrotron self-absorption B-field strength (BSSA) can be significantly affected because BSSA is proportional to the fifth power of turnover frequency.

<title>Impact of Overlapping Signals on Parameterized Post-Newtonian Coefficients in Tests of Gravity</title>

Gravitational waves have been instrumental in providing deep insights into the nature of gravity. Next-generation detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, are predicted to have a higher detection rate given the increased sensitivity and lower cutoff frequency. However, this increased sensitivity raises challenges concerning parameter estimation due to the foreseeable overlap of signals from multiple sources. Overlapping signals (OSs), if not properly identified, may introduce biases in estimating post-Newtonian (PN) coefficients in parameterized tests of general relativity (GR). We investigate how OSs affect −1PN to 2PN terms in parameterized GR tests, examining their potential to falsely suggest GR deviations. We estimate the prevalence of such misleading signals in next-generation detectors, and their collective influence on GR tests. We compare the effects of OSs on coefficients at different PN orders, concluding that overall the 1PN coefficient suffers the most. Our findings also reveal that while a nonnegligible portion of OSs exhibit biases in PN coefficients that might individually prefer to conclude deviations from GR, collectively, the direction to deviate is random and a statistical combination will still be in favor of GR.

<title>Global Impact of Emerging Internetwork Fields on the Low Solar Atmosphere</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Small-scale, newly emerging internetwork (IN) magnetic fields are considered a viable source of energy and mass for the solar chromosphere and possibly the corona. Multiple studies show that single events of flux emergence can indeed locally heat the low solar atmosphere through interactions of the upward propagating magnetic loops and the preexisting ambient field lines. However, the global impact of the newly emerging IN fields on the solar atmosphere is still unknown. In this paper, we study the spatiotemporal evolution of IN bipolar flux features and analyze their impact on the energetics and dynamics of the quiet-Sun atmosphere. We use high-resolution, multiwavelength, coordinated observations obtained with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, Hinode, and the Solar Dynamics Observatory to identify emerging IN magnetic fields and follow their evolution. Our observational results suggest that only the largest IN bipoles are capable of heating locally the low solar atmosphere, while the global contribution of these bipoles appears to be marginal. However, the total number of bipoles detected and their impact estimated in this work is limited by the sensitivity level, spatial resolution, and duration of our observations. To detect smaller and weaker IN fields that would maintain the basal flux, and examine their contribution to the chromospheric heating, we will need higher resolution, higher sensitivity, and longer time series obtained with current and next-generation ground- and space-based telescopes.

<title>Episodic Energy Release during the Main and Post-impulsive Phases of a Solar Flare</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
When and where the magnetic field energy is released and converted in eruptive solar flares remains an outstanding topic in solar physics. To shed light on this question, here we report multiwavelength observations of a C9.4-class eruptive limb flare that occurred on 2017 August 20. The flare, accompanied by a magnetic flux rope eruption and a white light coronal mass ejection, features three post-impulsive X-ray and microwave bursts immediately following its main impulsive phase. For each burst, both microwave and X-ray imaging suggest that the nonthermal electrons are located in the above-the-loop-top region. Interestingly, contrary to many other flares, the peak flux of the three post-impulsive microwave and X-ray bursts shows an increase for later bursts. Spectral analysis reveals that the sources have a hardening spectral index, suggesting a more efficient electron acceleration into the later post-impulsive bursts. We observe a positive correlation between the acceleration of the magnetic flux rope and the nonthermal energy release during the post-impulsive bursts in the same event. Intriguingly, different from some other eruptive events, this correlation does not hold for the main impulse phase of this event, which we interpret as energy release due to the tether-cutting reconnection before the primary flux rope acceleration occurs. In addition, using footpoint brightenings at conjugate flare ribbons, a weakening reconnection guide field is inferred, which may also contribute to the hardening of the nonthermal electrons during the post-impulsive phase.

We analyze variability in 15-season optical lightcurves from the doubly imaged lensed quasar SDSS J165043.44+425149.3 (SDSS1650), comprising five seasons of monitoring data from the Maidanak Observatory (277 nights in total, including the two seasons of data previously presented in Vuissoz et al.), five seasons of overlapping data from the Mercator telescope (269 nights), and 12 seasons of monitoring data from the US Naval Observatory, Flagstaff Station at lower cadence (80 nights). We update the 2007 time-delay measurement for SDSS1650 with these new data, finding a time delay of days, with image A leading image B. We analyze the microlensing variability in these lightcurves using a Bayesian Monte Carlo technique to yield measurements of the size of the accretion disk at λrest = 2420 Å, finding a half-light radius of log(r1/2/cm) = assuming a 60° inclination angle. This result is unchanged if we model 30% flux contamination from the broad-line region. We use the width of the Mg ii line in the existing Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra to estimate the mass of this system’s supermassive black hole, finding MBH = 2.47 × 109M⊙. We confirm that the accretion disk size in this system, whose black hole mass is on the very high end of the MBH scale, is fully consistent with the existing quasar accretion disk size–black hole mass relation.

We present Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (Fermi-GBM) and Swift Burst Alert Telescope (Swift-BAT) searches for gamma-ray/X-ray counterparts to gravitational-wave (GW) candidate events identified during the third observing run of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. Using Fermi-GBM onboard triggers and subthreshold gamma-ray burst (GRB) candidates found in the Fermi-GBM ground analyses, the Targeted Search and the Untargeted Search, we investigate whether there are any coincident GRBs associated with the GWs. We also search the Swift-BAT rate data around the GW times to determine whether a GRB counterpart is present. No counterparts are found. Using both the Fermi-GBM Targeted Search and the Swift-BAT search, we calculate flux upper limits and present joint upper limits on the gamma-ray luminosity of each GW. Given these limits, we constrain theoretical models for the emission of gamma rays from binary black hole mergers.

总结:<br /><br /> 近几十年来，通过Hubble Space Telescope（HST）进行的快照项目，针对超新星（SNe）和超新星冒名者进行了研究。这些研究旨在通过两种滤镜获得晚期光度，揭示能量残留的来源，包括放射性衰变、SN冲击波与周围星际物质的相互作用，还是光回声的存在。此外，这些结果也为之前HST周期中其他调查者的快照项目提供了补充和延伸。 <div>
Over recent decades, robotic (or highly automated) searches for supernovae (SNe) have discovered several thousand events, many of them in quite nearby galaxies (distances < 30 Mpc). Most of these SNe, including some of the best-studied events to date, were found before maximum brightness and have associated with them extensive follow-up photometry and spectroscopy. Some of these discoveries are so-called “SN impostors,” thought to be superoutbursts of luminous blue variable stars, although possibly a new, weak class of massive-star explosions. We conducted a Snapshot program with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and obtained images of the sites of 31 SNe and four impostors, to acquire late-time photometry through two filters. The primary aim of this project was to reveal the origin of any lingering energy for each event, whether it is the result of radioactive decay or, in some cases, ongoing late-time interaction of the SN shock with preexisting circumstellar matter, or the presence of a light echo. Alternatively, lingering faint light at the SN position may arise from an underlying stellar population (e.g., a host star cluster, companion star, or a chance alignment). The results from this study complement and extend those from Snapshot programs by various investigators in previous HST cycles.

<div> 候选天体BH1, 失败超新星, 星体融合, 红外观测, 理论模糊

总结:
候选天体N6946-BH1（BH1）是一个可能的失败超新星候选天体，被认为是一种异常事件，在这种事件中，一颗大质量恒星消失时没有预期的明亮超新星爆炸，而是伴随着坍缩形成黑洞。文章报告了BH1的最新观测结果，发现先前所有的观测其实是至少三个不同天体的混合。在近红外波段，BH1比前体源暗淡，但与2017年时的状态相似。而在中红外波段，流量似乎比最佳前体模型的估计流量要亮。总体来看，该天体的总光度为前体源的13%至25%。此外，红外观测结果与聚环香烃特征相一致，这种特征是在尘埃被近紫外辐射照射时产生的。目前，BH1的解释仍不确定。观测结果符合恒星融合的预期，但失败超新星假设中的理论模糊使得很难排除其他可能性。 <div>
N6946-BH1 (BH1) is the first plausible candidate for a failed supernova (SN), a peculiar event in which a massive star disappears without the expected bright SN, accompanied by collapse into a black hole (BH). Following a luminous outburst in 2009, the source experienced a significant decline in optical brightness, while maintaining a persistent IR presence. While it was proposed to be a potential failed SN, such behavior has been observed in SN impostor events in nearby galaxies. Here, we present late-time observations of BH1, taken 14 yr after disappearance, using JWST’s NIRCam and MIRI instruments to probe a never before observed region of the object’s spectral energy distribution (SED). We show for the first time that all previous observations of BH1 (pre- and postdisappearance) are actually a blend of at least three sources. In the near-infrared, BH1 is notably fainter than the progenitor but retains similar brightness to its state in 2017. In the mid-infrared the flux appears to have brightened compared to the inferred fluxes from the best-fitting progenitor model. The total luminosity of the source is between 13% and 25% that of the progenitor. We also show that the IR SED appears consistent with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon features that arise when dust is illuminated by near-ultraviolet radiation. At present, the interpretation of BH1 remains uncertain. The observations match expectations for a stellar merger, but theoretical ambiguity in the failed SN hypothesis makes it hard to dismiss.

One-dimensional stellar evolution calculations produce uncertain predictions for quantities like the age, core mass, core compactness, and nucleosynthetic yields; a key source of uncertainty is the modeling of interfaces between regions that are convectively stable and those that are not. Theoretical and numerical work has demonstrated that there should be numerous processes adjacent to the convective boundary that induce chemical and angular momentum transport, as well as modify the thermal structure of the star. One such process is called convective penetration, wherein vigorous convection extends beyond the nominal convective boundary and alters both the composition and thermal structure. In this work, we incorporate the process of convective penetration in stellar evolution calculations using the stellar evolution software instrument mesa. We implement convective penetration according to the description presented by Anders et al. to to calculate a grid of models from the pre-main sequence to helium core depletion. The extent of the convective penetration zone is self-consistently calculated at each time step without introducing new free parameters. We find both a substantial penetration zone in all models with a convective core and observable differences to global stellar properties such as the luminosity and radius. We present how the predicted radial extent of the penetration zone scales with the total stellar mass, age, and metallicity of the star. We discuss our results in the context of existing numerical and observational studies.

<div> 黑洞，磁星，伽马射线暴，X射线发射，Blandford–Znajek

本研究提出，伽马射线暴的X射线余辉中的平台和急剧衰减可能产生于一个Blandford–Znajek喷流，此喷流可能是一个具有准周期振荡特征的旋转喷流。这种光变曲线不太可能由一个短寿命的超大质量磁星引起，因此更可能是由Kerr黑洞作为中心引擎。伽马射线暴050904的X射线余辉表现出了九个耀斑，特征是由一个具有准周期振荡特征的平台和急剧衰减，这可以通过旋转BZ喷流模型很好地重新现。因此，一个区分这两种引擎的潜在线索在于是否在整个平台和随后的急剧衰减期间存在准周期振荡的特征，因为磁星情景暗示着在平台结束时的坍缩。<br /><br />总结: 本研究提出X射线余辉可能源自旋转BZ喷流，而不是磁星，而通过对伽马射线暴050904的分析支持了这一观点。 <div>
A stellar-mass black hole (BH) or a millisecond magnetar is believed to be born as the central engine of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The presence of plateaus in the X-ray extended emission or afterglow of GRBs is widely accepted as an indicator of a magnetar central engine, particularly those with a sharp decay (faster than t−3), the so-called internal plateau. However, an alternative model, by taking the evolution of the magnetic flux at the BH horizon into account, suggests that an internal plateau can also arise from a jet powered by the Blandford–Znajek (BZ) mechanism (hereafter, a BZ jet). In this study, we propose that a precessional BZ jet would manifest a quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) signature on the internal plateau and the subsequent sharp decay. Such lightcurves cannot be readily explained by the activity of a short-lived, supermassive magnetar, thus favoring a Kerr BH as the central engine. The X-ray afterglow of GRB 050904, comprising nine flares, is characterized by a QPO-modulated plateau and sharp decay, which can be well reproduced by a precessional BZ jet model. Therefore, one potential clue for distinguishing between these two engines lies in whether the QPO signature is present throughout the entire plateau and the subsequent sharp decay, as the magnetar scenario suggests a collapse at the end of the plateau.

<div> β Pictoris system, JWST MIRI, infrared excess, dust population, [Ar ii] emission
<br /><br />
β Pictoris系统的研究利用JWST MIRI中分辨率光谱仪进行观测。研究发现系统内有未解析的点源发出5至7.5微米的红外过剩辐射，表明系统内有约7天文单位距离的尘埃存在。通过点扩散函数子（PSF）减去MRS数据立方体，检测到在5微米处空间分辨的热尘埃群。这表明小尘埃颗粒被产生在系统的几个天文单位内，并被辐射逐渐驱动向外移动，可能最终会吸积到已知行星β Pictoris b和c上。此外还检测到6.986μm处的[Ar ii]发射线，经过PSF子减技术，以5σ的水平探测到β Pictoris b，并呈现了该行星从5到7μm的第一组中红外光谱。进一步分析表明该行星的大气可能有次恒星的碳/氧比率。 
<br /><br />总结: 
- 在β Pictoris系统内观测到红外过剩，表明系统内有尘埃存在
- PSF子减技术揭示了5μm处的空间分辨热尘埃群
- [Ar ii]发射线与尘埃盘轴向对齐
- 首次从5到7μm获得了β Pictoris b的中红外光谱
- 行星大气可能具有次恒星的C/O比率 <div>
We present JWST MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) observations of the β Pictoris system. We detect an infrared excess from the central unresolved point source from 5 to 7.5 μm which is indicative of dust within the inner ∼7 au of the system. We perform point-spread function (PSF) subtraction on the MRS data cubes and detect a spatially resolved dust population emitting at 5 μm. This spatially resolved hot dust population is best explained if the dust grains are in the small grain limit (2πa ≪ λ). The combination of unresolved and resolved dust at 5 μm could suggest that dust grains are being produced in the inner few astronomical units of the system and are then radiatively driven outwards, where the particles could accrete onto the known planets in the system, β Pictoris b and c. We also report the detection of an emission line at 6.986 μm that we attribute to [Ar ii]. We find that the [Ar ii] emission is spatially resolved with JWST and appears to be aligned with the dust disk. Through PSF-subtraction techniques, we detect β Pictoris b at the 5σ level in our MRS data cubes and present the first mid-infrared spectrum of the planet from 5 to 7 μm. The planet’s spectrum is consistent with having absorption from water vapor between 5 and 6.5 μm. We perform atmosphere model grid fitting of the spectra and photometry of β Pictoris b and find that the planet’s atmosphere likely has a substellar C/O ratio.

该研究对PG 1302−102类星体进行了密集的多波段监测，利用Swift和Las Cumbres Observatory 网络望远镜。通过对该类星体进行持续9个月的观测，展现出不同波长之间相互关联的中等到显著水平的变化。研究测量了波段之间的时间延迟，结果表明存在与标准盘反射预期一致的τ∝ λ4/3关系，并展示了利用这种新颖角度研究超大质量黑洞双星的可行性。尽管源物理特性类似于其他通过探测技术映射的活动星系核，但并未发现支持该类星体包含超大质量黑洞双星的普遍假设的证据。这表明该研究为LSST深度钻探领域提供了新的可能性。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
We present an intensive multiwavelength monitoring campaign of the quasar PG 1302−102 with Swift and the Las Cumbres Observatory network telescopes. At z ∼ 0.3, it tests the limits of the reverberation mapping (RM) technique in probing the accretion disk around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) and extends the parameter space to high masses and high accretion rates. This is also the first time the RM technique has been applied to test disk structures predicted in the SMBH binary model that has been suggested for this source. PG 1302−102 was observed at a ∼daily cadence for ∼9 months in 14 bands spanning from X-ray to UV and optical wavelengths, and it shows moderate to significant levels of variability correlated between wavelengths. We measure the interband time lags, which are consistent with a τ ∝ λ4/3 relation as expected from standard disk reprocessing, albeit with large uncertainties. The disk size implied by the lag spectrum is consistent with the expected disk size for its black hole mass within uncertainties. While the source resembles other reverberation-mapped active galactic nuclei in many respects, and we do not find evidence supporting the prevalent hypothesis that it hosts an SMBH binary, we demonstrate the feasibility of studying SMBH binaries from this novel angle and suggest possibilities for the LSST Deep Drilling Fields.

该研究通过ALMA观测到的12CO(2-1)和13CO(2-1)排放线，对Antennae星系的重叠区域进行了巨大分子云（GMCs）的分类。研究发现，该区域内有17个GMCs具有形成超星团（SSCs）所需的质量、压力和大小。然而，只有一个GMC具有明显的电离辐射，其他16个可能仍处于未受干扰的状态。此外，与其他星系相比，星暴区域和星系中心的GMCs具有更高的亮度、表面密度和湍流压力，而Antennae星系的GMCs具有最宽的谱线宽度和最高的维里参数。总的来说，Antennae星系的GMCs在密度和运动状态上都具有异常的特征。 
<br /><br />总结: 该研究通过ALMA观测对Antennae星系的重叠区域进行了GMC的分类，发现了17个有潜力形成超星团的GMCs，并进行了和其他星系的比较分析。结果表明Antennae星系的GMCs具有异常的物理特性，具有很高的亮度、表面密度和湍流压力，以及异常宽的谱线宽度和高的维里参数。 <div>
As the closest major galaxy merger and home to thousands of super star clusters (SSCs), the Antennae Galaxies (NGC 4038 and NGC 4039) are an important location to study the molecular clouds at sites of vigorous star formation. We cataloged giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in the region where the two galaxies overlap using high-resolution (∼0.″1–10 pc) Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of the 12CO(2−1) and 13CO(2−1) emission lines. Of the 72 individual GMCs identified in the overlap region, 17 are within uncertainties of having the necessary mass, pressure, and size needed to form SSCs. Of those 17 GMCs, only one has significant ionizing radiation, indicating that the birth environments are likely still intact in the 16 other GMCs. We compared the physical properties calculated from 12CO(2−1) GMC data with observations of 10 other galaxies obtained using the same emission line and similar resolution. Compared to other sources in this sample, the GMCs from the Antennae, as well as in other starbursts and in the centers of galaxies, have the highest luminosities, surface densities, and turbulent pressures. The GMCs in starbursts and at the centers of galaxies also have large line widths, although the line widths in the Antennae are among the widest. These comparative results also indicate that the Antennae GMCs have the highest virial parameters despite their high densities.

<div> 关键词: protoplanetary disk, irradiation instability, staircase shape, bright rings, dark gaps

总结:
在这篇文章中，研究人员发现，原行星盘受到中央恒星的辐射控制，导致了所谓的辐照不稳定性。他们的研究表明，这种不稳定性会使盘形成一种阶梯状的形态，具有明亮的环和黑暗的间隙。这种状态可以通过RADMC-3D代码验证为热平衡。这一发现对行星盘的演化和行星形成有重要的影响，而之前关于辐射盘保持光滑状态的研究存在错误。这项研究的结果可能需要更复杂的辐射动力学模拟来进一步验证。<br /><br /> <div>
Much of a protoplanetary disk is thermally controlled by irradiation from the central star. Such a disk, long thought to have a smoothly flaring shape, is unstable due to the so-called irradiation instability. But what is the outcome of such an instability? In particular, is it possible that such a disk settles into a shape that is immune to the instability? We combine Athena++ with a simplified thermal treatment to show that passively heated disks settle into a staircase shape. Here, the disk is punctuated by bright rings and dark gaps, with the bright rings intercepting the lion’s share of stellar illumination, and the dark gaps are hidden in their shadows. The optical surface of such a disk (the height at which starlight is absorbed) resembles a staircase. Although our simulations do not have realistic radiative transfer, we use the RADMC-3D code to show that this steady state is in good thermal equilibrium. It is possible that realistic disks reach such a state via ways not captured by our simulations. In contrast to our results here, two previous studies have claimed that irradiated disks stay smooth. We show here that they err on different issues. The staircase state, if confirmed by more sophisticated radiative hydrodynamic simulations, has a range of implications for disk evolution and planet formation.

总结: 
本研究在银河系中心超大质量黑洞周围约0.4 pc的范围内进行了光变性的观测，首次估计了年轻恒星的固有双星分数。实验中发现了三颗双星，通过详细的光变模拟和实验敏感度的分析，估算出银河系中心年轻恒星双星分数至少为71%（68%的置信度）或者42%（95%的置信度）。这一结果与太阳附近年轻恒星群体的表现一致，然而，与之前的研究相比，本研究得出的双星分数显著更高。因此，支持了双星分数在径向上存在依赖性的动力学预测。这一研究也提示了银河系中心的年轻恒星双星分数与其它地区存在差异。 <br /><br /> <div>
We present the first estimate of the intrinsic binary fraction of young stars across the central ≈0.4 pc surrounding the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the Milky Way Galactic center (GC). This experiment searched for photometric variability in 102 spectroscopically confirmed young stars, using 119 nights of 10″ wide adaptive optics imaging observations taken at W. M. Keck Observatory over 16 yr in the -[2.1 μm] and H-[1.6 μm] bands. We photometrically detected three binary stars, all of which are situated more than 1″ (0.04 pc) from the SMBH and one of which, S2-36, is newly reported here with spectroscopic confirmation. All are contact binaries or have photometric variability originating from stellar irradiation. To convert the observed binary fraction into an estimate of the underlying binary fraction, we determined the experimental sensitivity through detailed light-curve simulations, incorporating photometric effects of eclipses, irradiation, and tidal distortion in binaries. The simulations assumed a population of young binaries, with stellar ages (4 Myr) and masses matched to the most probable values measured for the GC young star population, and underlying binary system parameters (periods, mass ratios, and eccentricities) similar to those of local massive stars. As might be expected, our experimental sensitivity decreases for eclipses narrower in phase. The detections and simulations imply that the young, massive stars in the GC have a stellar binary fraction ≥71% (68% confidence), or ≥42% (95% confidence). This inferred GC young star binary fraction is consistent with that typically seen in young stellar populations in the solar neighborhood. Furthermore, our measured binary fraction is significantly higher than that recently reported by Chu et al. based on radial velocity measurements for stars ≲1″ of the SMBH. Constrained with these two studies, the probability that the same underlying young star binary fraction extends across the entire region is <1.4%. This tension provides support for a radial dependence of the binary star fraction, and therefore, for the dynamical predictions of binary merger and evaporation events close to the SMBH.

模拟操作环境中，研究了基于机器学习的耀斑预测模型的行为。 使用Georgia State University的太阳耀斑空间天气分析基准数据集，考察了训练方法和太阳周期对决策树，支持向量机和多层感知器性能的影响。 我们使用三个时间训练窗口实现我们的分类器：固定，滚动和扩展。 对于每个窗口，测试了一定数量的输入特征和时间尺寸。 令人惊讶的是，我们发现，对于20个月的窗口，技能评分在窗口类型，特征数量和选择的分类器的情况下是可比较的。而减小这个窗口的大小仅略微降低了固定和滚动窗口的性能。这意味着，在有足够的数据的情况下，可以选择固定窗口，无需重新训练模型。最后，发现模型的假阳性率与太阳X射线背景通量存在适度的强正相关。这表明太阳周期阶段对预测有着相当大的影响。
<br /><br />总结: 本研究考察了机器学习模型在模拟操作环境中的预测行为，发现固定窗口的性能可与其他窗口类型媲美，而且可以省去模型重新训练的需求。此外，还发现了模型的假阳性率与太阳X射线背景通量之间存在着正相关。 <div>
This study explores the behavior of machine-learning-based flare forecasting models deployed in a simulated operational environment. Using Georgia State University’s Space Weather Analytics for Solar Flares benchmark data set, we examine the impacts of training methodology and the solar cycle on decision tree, support vector machine, and multilayer perceptron performance. We implement our classifiers using three temporal training windows: stationary, rolling, and expanding. The stationary window trains models using a single set of data available before the first forecasting instance, which remains constant throughout the solar cycle. The rolling window trains models using data from a constant time interval before the forecasting instance, which moves with the solar cycle. Finally, the expanding window trains models using all available data before the forecasting instance. For each window, a number of input features (1, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 120) and temporal sizes (5, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 20 months) were tested. To our surprise, we found that, for a window of 20 months, skill scores were comparable regardless of the window type, feature count, and classifier selected. Furthermore, reducing the size of this window only marginally decreased stationary and rolling window performance. This implies that, given enough data, a stationary window can be chosen over other window types, eliminating the need for model retraining. Finally, a moderately strong positive correlation was found to exist between a model’s false-positive rate and the solar X-ray background flux. This suggests that the solar cycle phase has a considerable influence on forecasting.

<title>On the Penetration of Large-scale Flows into Stellar Radiative Zones</title>

The propagation of meridional circulation below the base of the convection zone (CZ) of low-mass stars may play a crucial role in the transport of angular momentum and also significantly contribute to the transport of chemical species and magnetic fields within their stable radiative zone (RZ). We systematically study these large-scale mean flows by performing three-dimensional global numerical simulations in a spherical shell that consists of a convective region overlying a stably stratified region. We find that the meridional flows can penetrate distances as large as ∼0.21ro (where ro is the outer radius) below the base of the CZ, provided that the Eddington–Sweet timescale tES is much shorter than the viscous timescale tν, as measured by the parameter . In the solar-like regime, where σ ≲ 1 in the upper RZ, we find that the angular momentum transport in the deep RZ is determined primarily by the action of the Coriolis force on meridional flows. In contrast, in models run in the σ > 1 regime, the meridional flows become weaker and the viscous effects dominate. We find that the penetration lengthscale δMC of these mean flows when σ ≲ 1 is proportional to σ−0.22. Our findings may provide a better understanding of the role of the meridional flows in the dynamics of the solar interior and inform future numerical studies that are focused on capturing solar-like dynamics self-consistently.

<title>Measuring Galaxy Abundance and Clustering at High Redshift from Incomplete Spectroscopic Data: Tests on Mock Catalogs</title>

The number density and correlation function of galaxies are two key quantities to characterize the distribution of the observed galaxy population. High-z spectroscopic surveys, which usually involve complex target selection and are incomplete in redshift sampling, present both opportunities and challenges to measure these quantities reliably in the high-z Universe. Using realistic mock catalogs, we show that target selection and redshift incompleteness can lead to significantly biased results, especially due to the flux-limit selection criteria. We develop a new method to correct the flux-limit effect, using information provided by the parent photometric data from which the spectroscopic sample is constructed. Our tests using realistic mock samples show that the method is able to reproduce the true stellar mass function and correlation function reliably. Mock catalogs are constructed for the existing zCOSMOS and VIPERS surveys, as well as for the forthcoming Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) galaxy evolution survey. The same set of mock samples are used to quantify the total variance expected for different sample sizes. We find that the total variance decreases very slowly when the survey area reaches about 4 deg2 for the abundance and about 8 deg2 for the clustering, indicating that the cosmic variance is no longer the dominant source of error for PFS-like surveys. We also quantify the improvements expected in the PFS-like galaxy survey relative to zCOSMOS and VIPERS surveys.

<title>Under Einstein’s Microscope: Measuring Properties of Individual Rotating Massive Stars from Extragalactic Microcaustic Crossings</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Highly magnified stars residing in caustic crossing lensed galaxies at z ≃ 0.7–1.5 in galaxy cluster lensing fields inevitably exhibit recurrent brightening events as they traverse a microcaustic network cast down by foreground intracluster stars. The detectable ones belong to nature’s most massive and luminous class of stars, with evolved blue supergiants being the brightest ones at optical wavelengths. Considering single stars in this work, we study to what extent intrinsic stellar parameters are measurable from multifilter light curves, which can be obtained with optical/near-IR space telescopes during one or multiple caustic crossing events. We adopt a realistic model for the axisymmetric surface brightness profiles of rotating O/B stars and develop a numerical lensing code that treats finite source size effects. With a single microcaustic crossing, the ratio of the surface rotation velocity to the breakup value is measurable to a precision of ∼0.1–0.2 for feasible observation parameters with current space telescopes, with all unknown intrinsic and extrinsic parameters marginalized over and without a degeneracy with inclination. Equatorial radius and bolometric luminosity can be measured to 1/3 and 2/3 of the fractional uncertainty in the microcaustic strength, for which the value is not known at each crossing but an informative prior can be obtained from theory. Parameter inference precision may be further improved if multiple caustic crossing events for the same lensed star are jointly analyzed. Our results imply new opportunities to survey individual massive stars in star formation sites at z ≃ 0.7–1.5 or beyond.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Until now, how the magnetic fields in M/X-class flaring active regions (ARs) differ from C-class flaring ARs remains unclear. Here, we calculate the key magnetic field parameters within the area of high photospheric free energy density (HED region) for 323 ARs (217 C- and 106 M/X-flaring ARs), including total photospheric free magnetic energy density Efree, total unsigned magnetic flux ΦHED, mean unsigned current helicity hc, length of the polarity inversion lines LPIL with a steep horizontal magnetic gradient, etc., and compare these with flare/coronal mass ejection (CME) properties. We first show the quantitative relations among the flare intensity, the eruptive character, and ΦHED. We reveal that ΦHED is a measure for the GOES flux upper limit of the flares in a given region. For a given ΦHED, there exists the lower limit of FSXR for eruptive flares. This means that only the relatively strong flares with the large fraction of energy release compared to the total free energy are likely to generate a CME. We also find that the combinations of Efree–LPIL and Efree–hc present a good ability to distinguish between C-class and M/X-class flaring ARs. Using determined critical values of Efree and LPIL, one predicts correctly 93 out of 106 M/X-class flaring ARs and 159 out of 217 C-class flaring ARs. The large LPIL or hc for M/X-class flaring ARs probably implies the presence of a compact current with twisted magnetic fields winding about it.

<title>Aliasing from Galactic Plane Setting in Widefield Radio Interferometry</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad2e9b</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Measurements with widefield radio interferometers often include the near-infinite gradient between the sky and the horizon. This causes aliasing inherent to the measurement itself and is purely a consequence of the Fourier basis. For this reason, the horizon is often attenuated by the instrumental beam down to levels deemed inconsequential. However, this effect is enhanced via our own Galactic plane as it sets over the course of a night. We show all-sky simulations of the Galactic plane setting in a low-frequency radio interferometer in detail for the first time. We then apply these simulations to the Murchison Widefield Array to show that a beam attenuation of 0.1% is not sufficient in some precision science cases. We determine that the noise statistics of the residual data image are drastically more Gaussian with aliasing removal, and explore consequences in simulation for cataloging of extragalactic sources and 21 cm Epoch of Reionization detection via the power spectrum.

<title>Locating Heating Channels of the Solar Corona in a Plage Region with the Aid of High-resolution 10830 Å Filtergrams</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this paper, with a set of high-resolution He i 10830 Å filtergrams, we select an area in a plage, very likely an extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) moss area, as an interface layer to follow the clues of coronal heating channels down to the photosphere. The filtergrams are obtained from the 1 m aperture New Vacuum Solar Telescope. We make a distinction between the darker and the brighter regions in the selected area and name the two regions enhanced absorption patches (EAPs) and low absorption patches (LAPs). With well-aligned, nearly simultaneous data from multiple channels of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and the continuum of the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board Solar Dynamics Observatory, we compare the EUV/UV emissions, emission measure, mean temperature, and continuum intensity in the two kinds of regions. The following progress is made: (1) The mean EUV emissions over EAPs are mostly stronger than the corresponding emissions over LAPs except for the emission at 335 Å. The UV emissions at 1600 and 1700 Å fail to capture the difference between the two regions. (2) In the logarithmic temperature range of 5.6–6.2, EAPs have a higher EUV emission measure than LAPs, but they have a lower mean coronal temperature. (3) The mean continuum intensity over EAPs is lower. Based on the above progress, we suggest that the energy for coronal heating in the moss region can be traced down to some areas in intergranular lanes with enhanced density of both cool and hot material. The lower temperature over the EAPs is due to the greater fraction of cool material over there.

<title>Quantified Plasma Heating and Energy Dissipation in the Earth’s Quasi-perpendicular Bow Shock</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The high-speed solar wind decelerates as it travels through the Earth’s bow shock, during which a portion of the incident flow energy is converted into the plasma thermal energy. However, the energy partition of plasma heating among different species, as well as the energy dissipation mechanism, remains elusive. In this paper, we quantify the plasma heating and the energy dissipation by calculating the pressure–strain interactions in 33 quasi-perpendicular bow shocks observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft. Our results show that the Joule dissipation measured by and the quasi-viscous dissipation quantified by PiD are distinct in the examined shocks. We also reveal that ions gain more energy than electrons, and the compressive effect is more important than the incompressible channel in plasma heating. PiD contributed by the gyrotropic pressure tensor is consistently positive for electrons; however, there is no discernible distinction between the gyrotropic and nongyrotropic contribution to PiD for ions.

We study the circular polarization of the magnetic-field-induced transition (MIT) between the 3d5(6S)4d7D2 and 3d5(6S)4p7P4° states of Cr i at 533.03 nm (wavelength in air). The fractional circular polarization V/I of this spectral line resulting from the solution of the radiation transfer problem in a sunspot model permeated by a homogeneous magnetic field of 3 kG shows amplitudes of about 2%. Spectropolarimetric observations of two sunspots were obtained with the Zurich Imaging Polarimeter-3 at the Istituto ricerche solari Aldo e Cele Daccò observatory in Locarno, Switzerland. The observed V/I profiles show approximately antisymmetrical shapes with an amplitude of around 0.1% and 0.2% for the two sunspots. The center of this profile coincides with the wavelengths predicted for the abovementioned MIT. We apply an inversion code to the spectropolarimetric data of the Cr i-permitted lines at 532.91 and 532.98 nm, as well as to the MIT line at 533.03 nm, to infer a stratification of the emitting atmosphere. We compare the V/I profiles synthesized in the inferred atmosphere models with the observations, showing that the observed signal likely corresponds to the MIT line.

<title>The Redshift Evolution of the M •–M ⋆ Relation for JWST’s Supermassive Black Holes at z > 4</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
JWST has detected many overmassive galactic systems at z > 4, where the mass of the black hole, M•, is 10–100 times larger than expected from local relations, given the host’s stellar mass, M⋆. This paper presents a model to describe these overmassive systems in the high-z Universe. We suggest that the black hole mass is the main driver of high-z star formation quenching. Supermassive black holes globally impact their high-z galaxies because their hosts are physically small, and the black holes have duty cycles close to unity at z > 4. In this regime, we assume that black hole mass growth is regulated by the quasar’s output, while stellar mass growth is quenched by it and uncorrelated to the global properties of the host halo. We find that the ratio M•/M⋆ controls the average star formation efficiency: if M•/M⋆ > 8 × 1018(nΛ/ fEdd)[(ΩbMh)/(ΩmM⋆) − 1], then the galaxy is unable to form stars efficiently. Once this ratio exceeds the threshold, a runaway process brings the originally overmassive system toward the local M•–M⋆ relation. Furthermore, the M•–M⋆ relation evolves with redshift as ∝(1 + z)5/2. At z ∼ 5, we find an overmassive factor of ∼55, in excellent agreement with current JWST data and the high-z relation inferred from those. Extending the black hole horizon farther in redshift and lower in mass will test this model and improve our understanding of the early coevolution of black holes and galaxies.

<title>On the Transition Stage of Pulsar Pulsed Radio Emission and Its Potential Association with Radio Pulsar Nulling</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
While the precise mechanism of generating pulsed coherent radio emission from pulsars remains elusive, certain gap-invoking models (especially, the inner gap model) offer a comprehensive and plausible explanation for the genesis and termination of such emissions. However, the transition stage between the period of persistent radio emission and the period of radio-quiet emission remains poorly understood, despite observations indicating that a radio pulsar in the pulse-nulling state is undergoing the transition stage. In this study, we present a qualitative explanation for the elusive transition stage by modeling pulsar magnetospheres analytically as equivalent resistive–capacitive circuits based on the inner gap model. Our result indicates that, due to lengthy spin-down, older radio pulsars will gradually shift from the state of persistent radio emission to a certain type of pulse-nulling state by delayed sparks within their inner gaps.

短周期外行星LHS 3844b被认为处于潮汐锁定状态，具有永久的昼夜两侧，可能受到极端的辐射。先前的研究表明，LHS 3844b可能没有大气层，这使得它成为约束行星自转的理想对象。通过对LHS 3844b的斯皮策相位曲线进行重新分析，采用了一个无大气层的热模型，我们排除了快速非同步自转的可能性，将行星的离心率限制在小于0.001的范围内，同时推测可能存在微弱的潮汐加热或者表面受到太空风化的影响。这些结果支持了短周期岩质外行星潮汐锁定的假设，并显示太空风化可以显著改变无大气层外行星的表面特征。<br /><br />总结: 研究表明LHS 3844b很可能被潮汐锁定，限制了其自转速度和轨道离心率，同时提出了可能存在微弱的潮汐加热或者表面太空风化的可能性。 <div>
Short-period exoplanets on circular orbits are thought to be tidally locked into synchronous rotation. If tidally locked, these planets must possess permanent day- and night-sides, with extreme irradiation on the dayside and none on the nightside. However, so far the tidal locking hypothesis for exoplanets is supported by little to no empirical evidence. Previous work showed that the super-Earth LHS 3844b likely has no atmosphere, which makes it ideal for constraining the planet’s rotation. Here we revisit the Spitzer phase curve of LHS 3844b with a thermal model of an atmosphere-less planet and analyze the impact of nonsynchronous rotation, eccentricity, tidal dissipation, and surface composition. Based on the lack of observed strong tidal heating we rule out rapid nonsynchronous rotation (including a Mercury-like 3:2 spin–orbit resonance) and constrain the planet's eccentricity to less than ∼0.001 (more circular than Io's orbit). In addition, LHS 3844b’s phase curve implies that the planet either still experiences weak tidal heating via a small-but-nonzero eccentricity (requiring an undetected orbital companion), or that its surface has been darkened by space weathering; of these two scenarios we consider space weathering more likely. Our results thus support the hypothesis that short-period rocky exoplanets are tidally locked, and further show that space weathering can significantly modify the surfaces of atmosphere-less exoplanets.

这篇文章报告了ALH 77307中发现的含有最高25Mg同位素组成的古代橄榄石，该成分挑战了当前的恒星模型。实验结果表明，这些橄榄石的地球化学特征与在超新星中形成并在前超新星阶段发生过氢摄取的假设最为接近。这是首个对来自氢燃烧超新星的古代橄榄石进行详细地球化学研究的报道，实现了3D分析和无与分析体积相关的贡献，同时获得了前所未有的空间分辨率。研究结果表明，橄榄石可能在重元素贫瘠的环境中凝结，或者在前超新星阶段末期或迅速坍缩时形成了局部气体组成不同的区域。 
<br /><br />总结: <br />presolar olivine, isotopic composition, hydrogen-burning SN, 3D analysis, spatial resolutions <div>
We have discovered a presolar olivine from ALH 77307 with the highest 25Mg isotopic composition measured in a silicate to date (δ25Mg = 3025.1‰ ± 38.3‰). Its isotopic compositions challenge current stellar models, with modeling of magnesium, silicon, and oxygen showing a closest match to formation in a supernova (SN) where hydrogen ingestion occurred in the pre-SN phase. Presolar grains within primitive astromaterials retain records of processes and environmental changes throughout stellar evolution. However, accessing these records has proved challenging due to the average grain size (∼150 nm) of presolar silicates, their sensitivity to extraction agents, and instrumental restrictions, limiting the range of isotopic and chemical signatures which can be studied per grain volume. Here, we present the first known detailed geochemical study of a presolar silicate from a hydrogen-burning SN, studied in 3D without contributions to the analysis volume and at unprecedented spatial resolutions (<1 nm), essential for constraining physical and chemical processes occurring within this recently proposed stellar environment. From our results, we infer either (i) condensation within an environment depleted of heavy elements compatible with the olivine lattice under the pressure and temperature conditions during condensation, or (ii) during periods of limited mixing either near the end of the pre-SN phase or from a collapse so rapid localized pockets of different gas compositions formed.

We use SEDz*—a code designed to chart the star formation histories (SFHs) of 6 < z < 12 galaxies—to analyze the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 894 galaxies with deep JWST/NIRCam imaging by JADES in the GOODS-S field. We show how SEDz* matches observed SEDs using stellar-population templates, graphing the contribution of each epoch by epoch to confirm the robustness of the technique. Very good SED fits for most SFHs demonstrate the compatibility of the templates with stars in the first galaxies—as expected, because their light is primarily from main-sequence A stars, free of post-main-sequence complexity, and insensitive to heavy-element compositions. We confirm earlier results from Dressler et al. (1) There are four types of SFHs: SFH1, burst; SFH2, stochastic; SFH3, “contiguous” (three epochs), and SFH4, “continuous” (four to six epochs). (2) Starbursts—both single and multiple—are predominant (∼70%) in this critical period of cosmic history, although longer SFHs (0.5–1.0 Gyr) contribute one-third of the accumulated stellar mass. These 894 SFHs contribute 1011.14, 1011.09, 1011.00, and 1010.60M⊙ for SFH1–4, respectively, adding up to ∼4 × 1011M⊙ by z = 6 for this field. We suggest that the absence of rising SFHs could be explained as an intense dust-enshrouded phase of star formation lasting tens of Myr that preceded each of the SFHs we measure. We find no strong dependencies of SFH type with the large-scale environment; however, the discovery of a compact group of 30 galaxies, 11 of which had first star formation at z = 11–12, suggests that long SFHs could dominate in rare, dense environments.

总结: 该研究涵盖了CMB-S4实验的重要性以及引入了一种新的引力透镜重建管道。该管道实现了对任意天空覆盖范围的最佳透镜重建并与CMB-S4的去透镜性能进行测试。研究发现，经过有效处理，重建的透镜 B 模方差减少了 92%–93%，达到了预期的性能，并为日后研究提供了重要的数据和方法。 <div>
The tightest constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r can only be obtained after removing a substantial fraction of the lensing B-mode sample variance. The planned Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)-S4 experiment (cmb-s4.org) will remove the lensing B-mode signal internally by reconstructing the gravitational lenses from high-resolution observations. We document here a first lensing reconstruction pipeline able to achieve this optimally for arbitrary sky coverage. We make it part of a map-based framework to test CMB-S4 delensing performance and its constraining power on r, including inhomogeneous noise and two non-Gaussian Galactic polarized foreground models. The framework performs component separation of the high-resolution maps, followed by the construction of lensing B-mode templates, which are then included in a parametric small-aperture map cross-spectra-based likelihood for r. We find that the lensing reconstruction and framework achieve the expected performance, compatible with the target σ(r) ≃ 5 · 10−4 in the absence of a tensor signal, after an effective removal of 92%–93% of the lensing B-mode variance, depending on the simulation set. The code for the lensing reconstruction can also be used for cross-correlation studies with large-scale structures, lensing spectrum reconstruction, cluster lensing, or other CMB lensing-related purposes. As part of our tests, we also demonstrate the joint optimal reconstruction of the lensing potential with the lensing curl potential mode at second order in the density fluctuations.

We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) deep spectroscopy for a lensed galaxy at zspec = 8.496 with whose optical nebular lines and stellar continuum are detected by JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam Early Release Observations in the field of SMACS J0723.3–7327. Our ALMA spectrum shows [O iii] 88 μm and [C ii] 158 μm line detections at 4.0σ and 4.5σ, respectively. The redshift and position of the [O iii] line coincide with those of the JWST source, while the [C ii] line is blueshifted by 90 km s−1 with a spatial offset of 0.″5 (≈0.5 kpc in the source plane) from the centroid of the JWST source. The NIRCam F444W image, including [O iii] λ5007 and Hβ line emission, spatially extends beyond the stellar components by a factor of >8. This indicates that the z = 8.5 galaxy has already experienced strong outflows as traced by extended [O iii] λ5007 and offset [C ii] emission, which would promote ionizing photon escape and facilitate reionization. With careful slit-loss corrections and the removal of emission spatially outside the galaxy, we evaluate the [O iii] 88 μm/λ5007 line ratio, and derive the electron density ne by photoionization modeling to be cm−3, which is comparable with those of z ∼ 2–3 galaxies. We estimate an [O iii] 88 μm/[C ii] 158 μm line ratio in the galaxy of >4, as high as those of known z ∼ 6–9 galaxies. This high [O iii] 88 μm/[C ii] 158 μm line ratio is generally explained by the high ne as well as the low metallicity ( ), high ionization parameter ( ), and low carbon-to-oxygen abundance ratio (log(C/O) = [−0.52: −0.24]) obtained from the JWST/NIRSpec data; further [C ii] follow-up observations will constrain the covering fraction of photodissociation regions.

The occurrence of a first-order hadron–quark matter phase transition at high baryon densities is investigated in astrophysical simulations of core-collapse supernovae, to decipher yet incompletely understood properties of the dense matter equation of state (EOS) using neutrinos from such cosmic events. It is found that the emission of a nonstandard second neutrino burst, dominated by electron antineutrinos, is not only a measurable signal for the appearance of deconfined quark matter but also reveals information about the state of matter at extreme conditions encountered at the supernova (SN) interior. To this end, a large set of spherically symmetric SN models is investigated, studying the dependence on the EOS and the stellar progenitor. General relativistic neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics is employed featuring three-flavor Boltzmann neutrino transport and a microscopic hadron-quark hybrid matter EOS class. Therefore, the DD2 relativistic mean-field hadronic model is employed, and several variations of it, and the string-flip model for the description of deconfined quark matter. The resulting hybrid model covers a representative range of onset densities for the phase transition and latent heats. This facilitates the direct connection between intrinsic signatures of the neutrino signal and properties of the EOS. In particular, a set of linear relations has been found empirically. These potentially provide a constraint for the onset density of a possible QCD phase transition from the future neutrino observation of the next galactic core-collapse SN, if a millisecond electron anti-neutrino burst is present around or less than 1 s.

总结:<br />
文章研究了巨大球状星团中多重恒星群的现象，发现第一种恒星群在球状星团中所占比例随着星团质量的增加而减少。通过假设固定的恒星质量阈值、星团质量与第一种恒星群比例之间的幂律关系以及第一种恒星群比例随时间保持不变等假设，对第一种恒星群比例随星团质量的关系进行了详细解析，并推论出在演化开始时具有至少4·105M⊙的最低质量阈值。这一高质量阈值严重限制了从演化星团中流失的第二种恒星群的数量，与银河星系晕的低第二种恒星群比例相吻合。根据假设的第一种恒星群比例恒定，推断了第二种恒星群不一定是在中心区域形成。 Magellanic Clouds集群在（质量，第一种恒星群比例）空间的位置与预期的中间时代集群在温和潮汐场中演化时一致。内外模型星团的分布与观测到的也一致。总的来说，该研究对球状星团中多重恒星群的现象进行了深入的研究和推断。 <div>
The phenomenon of multiple stellar populations is exacerbated in massive globular clusters, with the fraction of first-population (1P) stars a decreasing function of the cluster present-day mass. We decipher this relation in far greater detail than has been done so far. We assume (i) a fixed stellar mass threshold for the formation of second-population (2P) stars, (ii) a power-law scaling between the mass mecl of newly formed clusters and their 1P star fraction F1P, and (iii) a constant F1P over time. The F1P(mecl) relation is then evolved up to an age of 12 Gyr for tidal field strengths representative of the entire Galactic halo. The 12 Gyr old model tracks cover the present-day distribution of Galactic globular clusters in the (mass, F1P) space extremely well. The distribution is curtailed on its top right side by the scarcity of clusters at large Galactocentric distances and on its bottom left side by the initial scarcity of very high-mass clusters and dynamical friction. Given their distinct dissolution rates, “inner” and “outer” model clusters are offset from each other, as observed. The locus of Magellanic Clouds clusters in the (mass, F1P) space is as expected for intermediate-age clusters evolving in a gentle tidal field. Given the assumed constancy of F1P, we conclude that 2P stars do not necessarily form centrally concentrated. We infer a minimum mass of 4 · 105M⊙ for multiple-population clusters at secular evolution onset. This high-mass threshold severely limits the number of 2P stars lost from evolving clusters, thereby fitting the low 2P star fraction of the Galactic halo field.

总结: <br /><br />研究使用WISPR观察到小尺度特征，推测为Kelvin–Helmholtz不稳定性，这些特征出现在Parker Solar Probe在7.5 R⊙和9.5 R⊙之间的日冕质量抛射尾部附近，持续约30分钟。通过分析涡旋的尺寸和边界层的厚度，以及估计的线性增长率，支持了KHI的候选性。研究强调了PSP/WISPR在观察太阳低层和中层日冕中此类现象的独特能力，尤其是当PSP的近日点距离太阳更近时。 <div>
We present a comprehensive analysis aimed at proving the hypothesis that a train of small-scale features observed by the Wide-field Imager (WISPR) onboard the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) are the signature of a Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (KHI). These features were seen near the flank of a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) wake between 7.5 R⊙ and 9.5 R⊙, lasting for about 30 minutes. The CME was a slow event, associated with a streamer blowout. We analyzed the size of the eddies and found growth during their evolution while maintaining separation distances and alignment typical of Kelvin–Helmholtz vortexes. We then assessed the magnetic field conditions that would make the observation of such an instability plausible. Two methods were used to cross-check our findings. The measured thickness of the boundary layer supports KHI candidacy, and the estimated linear growth rate suggests nonlinear saturation within the expected timescale. We conclude that a KHI is a plausible explanation for the observed features, and therefore that such instabilities might exist in the low and middle solar corona (within ∼15 R⊙) and can be detected in white light observations. Their observation, however, might be rare due to stringent conditions like the observer’s proximity, suitable viewing circumstances, magnetic field topology, and flow properties. This study highlights the unique capability of PSP/WISPR in observing such phenomena, especially as PSP perihelia reach closer distances to the Sun.

文章介绍了年轻恒星源HH 30的特点和结构。通过Hubble Space Telescope观测到HH 30的离子光学喷流，同时Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array观测到了12CO的残余包层。光学喷流具有窄的外观、基部较大的线宽和高温度。通过位置-速度图可以识别三种主要结构：具有大谱线宽度的极高速宽角风组分、12CO中观测到的极低速环境介质、以及与主要风和周围环境介质在速度和位置上都有嵌套的12CO跟踪的低速区域。在光学喷流周围形成了多层空腔结构，由内部盘区域起源的原子气体通过禁闭线发出明亮的光学喷流，宽角部分扩展形成低密度腔体。12CO纤维环绕着风腔混合并通过磁场相互作用向内部运动。HH 30系统是Shang等人提出的统一风模型的理想表现，通过其中区分的原子和分子物种混合以及环绕的寒冷分子环境物质。 <div>
The young stellar source HH 30 is a textbook example of an ionic optical jet originating from a disk in an edge-on system shown by the Hubble Space Telescope. It has a remnant envelope in 12CO observed by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The optical jet is characterized by its narrow appearance, large line width at the base, and high temperature inferred from line diagnostics. Three featured structures can be identified, most evident in the transverse position–velocity diagrams: an extremely-high-velocity wide-angle wind component with large spectral widths in the optical, a very-low-velocity ambient surrounding medium seen in 12CO, and a low-velocity region traced by 12CO nested both in velocity and location between the primary wind and ambient environment. A layered cavity with multiple shells forms nested morphological and kinematic structures around the optical jet. The atomic gas originating from the innermost region of the disk attains a sufficient temperature and ionization to emit brightly in forbidden lines as an optical jet. The wide-angle portion expands, forming a low-density cavity. The filamentary 12CO encompassing the wind cavity is mixed and advected inward through the action of the magnetic interplay of the wide-angle wind with the molecular ambient medium. The magnetic interplay results in the layered shells penetrating deeply into the vast cavity of tenuous atomic wind material. The HH 30 system is an ideal manifestation of the unified wind model of Shang et al. (2020, 2023), with clearly distinguishable atomic and molecular species mixed through the atomic lightly ionized magnetized wind and the surrounding cold molecular ambient material.

总结:
本文介绍了Solar Orbiter上的Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX)提供了进行太阳耀斑立体X射线观测的独特机会，该观测与当前和未来的地球X射线任务进行比较。这些观测将产生几十年来第一次可靠的硬X射线（HXR）直接度量，提供耀斑加速电子的一个新的诊断，并有助于限制耀斑中加速电子的过程。文章展示了HXR直接度量如何随着不同的电子和耀斑特性而变化，并展示了建模可以如何从数据中提取这些通常未知的特性。最后，文章展示了通过与本文建模的比较如何提取HXR直接度量，并呈现了两个耀斑的初步HXR直接度分析，证明了这样的观测的可行性和挑战，以及如何通过与此处展示的建模比较来提取HXR直接度量。 <div>
The Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) on board Solar Orbiter (SolO) provides a unique opportunity to systematically perform stereoscopic X-ray observations of solar flares with current and upcoming X-ray missions at Earth. These observations will produce the first reliable measurements of hard X-ray (HXR) directivity in decades, providing a new diagnostic of the flare-accelerated electron angular distribution and helping to constrain the processes that accelerate electrons in flares. However, such observations must be compared to modeling, taking into account electron and X-ray transport effects and realistic plasma conditions, all of which can change the properties of the measured HXR directivity. Here, we show how HXR directivity, defined as the ratio of X-ray spectra at different spacecraft viewing angles, varies with different electron and flare properties (e.g., electron angular distribution, highest-energy electrons, and magnetic configuration), and how modeling can be used to extract these typically unknown properties from the data. Finally, we present a preliminary HXR directivity analysis of two flares, observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor and SolO/STIX, demonstrating the feasibility and challenges associated with such observations, and how HXR directivity can be extracted by comparison with the modeling presented here.

<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了相对论性再连接流速度的缩放，同时考虑了沿着重新连接磁场的剪切流和指向重新连接平面外的引导场。在非相对论性再连接中，已发现超阿尔文剪切流会抑制再连接。我们将这一现象的分析模型扩展到相对论情况，并发现了类似的行为，这得到了粒子在单元模拟的证实。与非相对论极限不同的是，引导场的加入降低了平面内的阿尔文速度，导致了更慢的流出喷流以及在强磁化等离子体中更有效地抑制了再连接。 <div>
The scaling of the relativistic reconnection outflow speed is studied in the presence of both shear flows parallel to the reconnecting magnetic fields and guide fields pointing out of the reconnection plane. In nonrelativistic reconnection, super-Alfvénic shear flows have been found to suppress reconnection. We extend the analytical model of this phenomenon to the relativistic regime and find similar behavior, which is confirmed by particle-in-cell simulations. Unlike the nonrelativistic limit, the addition of a guide field lowers the in-plane Alfvén velocity, contributing to slower outflow jets and the more efficient suppression of reconnection in strongly magnetized plasmas.

<div> 关键词: 太阳耀斑, 多波段观测, 热-非热能量, 等离子体参数, 太阳飞行器<br />
总结: <br />本研究分析了2021年9月20日至25日期间太阳飞行器接收到的来自近距离观测的约200次较弱耀斑的多波段辐射数据。通过关联硬X射线通量和软X射线通量，并结合耀斑峰值软X射线通量，确定了强非热耀斑。对20次强非热弱耀斑的多波段观测结果表明硬X射线通量与辐射度存在反比关系，而与等离子体温度呈正相关。这表明在得到非热能量输入后，低密度环路中的等离子体温度比高密度环路中的温度更高。同时，研究结果进一步表明太阳耀斑最初阶段的等离子体参数对热-非热能量分配起着决定性作用。 <div>
The disparate nature of the thermal–nonthermal energy partition during flares, particularly during weak flares, is still an open issue. Following the Neupert effect, quantifying the relative yield of X-ray emission in different energy bands can enable the inferring of the underlying energy release mechanism. During 2021 September 20–25, the Solar Orbiter mission—being closer to the Sun (∼0.6 au) and having a moderate separation angle (<40°) from the Sun–Earth line—offered a unique opportunity to analyze multiwavelength emission from ∼200 (mostly weak) flares, commonly observed by the Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX), STEREO-A, GOES, and the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Associating the quotient (qf) of hard X-ray fluence (12–20 keV) and soft X-ray flux (4–10 keV) with the peak soft X-ray flux enabled us to identify strongly nonthermal flares. A multiwavelength investigation of spectral and imaging-mode observations of the 20 strongly nonthermal weak flares reveals an inverse relationship of qf with the emission measure (and density), and a positive relationship with the flare plasma temperature. This indicates that the plasma in tenuous loops attains higher temperatures compared to that in the denser loops, in response to nonthermal energy deposition. This is in agreement with the plasma parameters of the coronal loops, as derived by applying the one-dimensional Palermo–Harvard hydrodynamical code to coronal loop plasma with different initial coronal loop base pressures when subjected to similar heating inputs. Our investigation, therefore, indicates that the plasma parameters of the flaring loop in the initial phase have a decisive role in the thermal–nonthermal energy partitioning.

<div> 关键词: 活动星系核（AGN），Sloan数字化天空测量（SDSS），Hα谱线，星形成，负反馈<br />
总结:<br />这篇手稿提供了支持低红移Sloan数字化天空测量（SDSS）Type 2 AGN宿主星系中全球负面活动星系核（AGN）反馈的线索，基于窄Hα发射线光度LHα和光学连续光度λLcont之间的不同依赖关系。研究发现，在Type 2 AGN中，λLcont和LHα的相关性显著低于星形成星系，即Type 2 AGN中的窄Hα发射线光度明显较低。此外，Dn（4000）和HδA的属性也提供了间接证据，支持Type 2 AGN中全球负面AGN反馈。本研究不仅支持局部Type 2 AGN中全球负面AGN反馈的存在，还展示了对全球负面AGN反馈对星形成抑制的量化。 <div>
In this manuscript, clues are provided to support globally negative active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback on star formation in the host galaxies of the local low-redshift Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Type 2 AGN, based on the different dependence of narrow Hα line luminosity LHα on optical continuum luminosity λLcont between star-forming galaxies and Type 2 AGN. Through the measured LHα and λLcont in SDSS star-forming galaxies, there is a strong linear correlation between λLcont and LHα, accepted as a standard correlation without the effects of AGN activity. Meanwhile, considering the apparent contribution of AGN activity to the narrow Hα line emissions in Type 2 AGN, the correlation between λLcont and LHα in the SDSS Type 2 AGN leads to a statistically lower LHα in Type 2 AGN than in star-forming galaxies, with a significance level higher than 5σ, even after considering necessary effects (including effects of host galaxy properties), leading to the accepted conclusion on the globally negative AGN feedback in the local Type 2 AGN. Meanwhile, the properties of Dn(4000) and HδA can provide indirect clues to support the globally negative AGN feedback in local Type 2 AGN, due to older stellar ages in Type 2 AGN. Moreover, it is interesting to expect more than 50% narrow Hα emissions globally suppressed in the host galaxies of Type 2 AGN relative to the star-forming galaxies. The results not only support globally negative AGN feedback in local Type 2 AGN, but also show further clues on the quantification of suppressions of star formation by the globally negative AGN feedback.

该研究评估了主宇宙中心星系不匹配率以及来自Dark Energy Survey 5 Yr（DES-SN5YR）光度样本模拟的宇宙学参数偏差。他们发现1.7%的SNe匹配到错误的主星系，这导致了红移的错误。采用他们的分析流程，他们发现由于包括了匹配错误的SNe，暗能量状态参数（Δw）的偏差很小，远小于来自DES-SN5YR样本的不确定性。他们鼓励进一步的研究，通过更好的主星系匹配算法或选择性剔除来减小这种偏差。<br /><br />总结: 评估了SNe Ia的主星系匹配率和其对宇宙学参数的偏差；发现偏差远小于样本不确定性；鼓励进一步研究改进匹配算法。 <div>
Redshift measurements, primarily obtained from host galaxies, are essential for inferring cosmological parameters from type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Matching SNe to host galaxies using images is nontrivial, resulting in a subset of SNe with mismatched hosts and thus incorrect redshifts. We evaluate the host galaxy mismatch rate and resulting biases on cosmological parameters from simulations modeled after the Dark Energy Survey 5 Yr (DES-SN5YR) photometric sample. For both DES-SN5YR data and simulations, we employ the directional light radius method for host galaxy matching. In our SN Ia simulations, we find that 1.7% of SNe are matched to the wrong host galaxy, with redshift differences between the true and matched hosts of up to 0.6. Using our analysis pipeline, we determine the shift in the dark energy equation of state parameter (Δw) due to including SNe with incorrect host galaxy matches. For SN Ia–only simulations, we find Δw = 0.0013 ± 0.0026 with constraints from the cosmic microwave background. Including core-collapse SNe and peculiar SNe Ia in the simulation, we find that Δw ranges from 0.0009 to 0.0032, depending on the photometric classifier used. This bias is an order of magnitude smaller than the expected total uncertainty on w from the DES-SN5YR sample of ∼0.03. We conclude that the bias on w from host galaxy mismatch is much smaller than the uncertainties expected from the DES-SN5YR sample, but we encourage further studies to reduce this bias through better host-matching algorithms or selection cuts.

本研究旨在探讨概率深度学习模型在宇宙学中的应用，重点是通过光度红移估计对大规模天文调查的角色。作者使用超级HSC调查中的星系数据集进行了实验，研究了神经网络和概率BNN在光度红移估计方面的表现，并评估了它们满足LSST光度红移学科要求的性能。实验结果显示，BNN能够准确地产生不确定性，通过覆盖率测试发现，在0 < z < 2.5的范围内，67.2%的星系的1σ不确定性覆盖了光谱值。同时，与其他机器学习模型相比，BNN在0 < z < 2.5范围内满足了LSST的光度红移学科要求中的三分之二。 
<br /><br />总结: <div>
We present results exploring the role that probabilistic deep learning models can play in cosmology from large-scale astronomical surveys through photometric redshift (photo-z) estimation. Photo-z uncertainty estimates are critical for the science goals of upcoming large-scale surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST); however, common machine learning methods typically provide only point estimates and lack uncertainties on predictions. We turn to Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) as a promising way to provide accurate predictions of redshift values with uncertainty estimates. We have compiled a galaxy data set from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey with grizy photometry, which is designed to be a smaller-scale version of large surveys like LSST. We use this data set to investigate the performance of a neural network and a probabilistic BNN for photo-z estimation and evaluate their performance with respect to LSST photo-z science requirements. We also examine the utility of photo-z uncertainties as a means to reduce catastrophic outlier estimates. The BNN outputs the estimate in the form of a Gaussian probability distribution. We use the mean and standard deviation as the redshift estimate and uncertainty. We find that the BNN can produce accurate uncertainties. Using a coverage test, we find excellent agreement with expectation—67.2% of galaxies between 0 < 2.5 have 1σ uncertainties that cover the spectroscopic value. We also include a comparison to alternative machine learning models using the same data. We find the BNN meets two out of three of the LSST photo-z science requirements in the range 0 < z < 2.5.

We present fluxes and light curves for a population of asteroids at millimeter wavelengths, detected by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) over 18,000 deg2 of the sky using data from 2017 to 2021. We utilize high cadence maps, which can be used in searching for moving objects such as asteroids and trans-Neptunian Objects, as well as for studying transients. We detect 170 asteroids with a signal-to-noise of at least 5 in at least one of the ACT observing bands, which are centered near 90, 150, and 220 GHz. For each asteroid, we compare the ACT measured flux to predicted fluxes from the near-Earth asteroid thermal model fit to WISE data. We confirm previous results that detected a deficit of flux at millimeter wavelengths. Moreover, we report a spectral characteristic to this deficit, such that the flux is relatively lower at 150 and 220 GHz than at 90 GHz. Additionally, we find that the deficit in flux is greater for S-type asteroids than for C-type.

Type Ia supernovae (SNe) remain poorly understood despite decades of investigation. Massive computationally intensive hydrodynamic simulations have been developed and run to model an ever-growing number of proposed progenitor channels. Further complicating the matter, a large number of subtypes of Type Ia SNe have been identified in recent decades. Due to the massive computational load required, inference of the internal structure of Type Ia SNe ejecta directly from observations using simulations has previously been computationally intractable. However, deep-learning emulators for radiation transport simulations have alleviated such barriers. We perform abundance tomography on 40 Type Ia SNe from optical spectra using the radiative transfer code TARDIS accelerated by the probabilistic DALEK deep-learning emulator. We apply a parametric model of potential outer ejecta structures to comparatively investigate abundance distributions and internal ionization fractions of intermediate-mass elements (IMEs) between normal and 1991T-like Type Ia SNe in the early phases. Our inference shows that the outer ejecta of 1991T-like Type Ia SNe is underabundant in the typical intermediate mass elements that heavily contribute to the spectral line formation seen in normal Type Ia SNe at early times. Additionally, we find that the IMEs present in 1991T-like Type Ia SNe are highly ionized compared to those in the normal Type Ia population. Finally, we conclude that the transition between normal and 1991T-like Type Ia SNe appears to be continuous observationally and that the observed differences come out of a combination of both abundance and ionization fractions in these SNe populations.

Some high-z active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are found to reside in extreme star-forming galaxies, such as hyperluminous infrared galaxies (HyLIRGs), with AGN-removed LIR of >1013L⊙. In this paper, we report NOEMA observations of six apparent starburst HyLIRGs associated with optical quasars at z ∼ 2–3 in the Stripe 82 field, to study their dust and molecular CO properties. Five out of the six candidates are detected with CO(4–3) or CO(5–4) emission, and four in the 2 mm dust continuum. Based on the linewidth– diagnostics, we find that four galaxies are likely unlensed or weakly lensed sources. The molecular gas mass is in the range of (with , where μ is the unknown possible gravitational magnification factor). We fit their spectral energy distributions, after including the observed 2 mm fluxes and upper limits, and estimate their apparent (uncorrected for possible lensing effects) star formation rates (μSFRs) to be ∼400–2500 M⊙ yr−1, with a depletion time of ∼20–110 Myr. We notice interesting offsets, of ∼10–40 kpc spatially or ∼1000–2000 km s−1 spectroscopically, between the optical quasar and the millimeter continuum or CO emissions. The observed velocity shift is likely related to the blueshifted broad-emission-line region of quasars, though mergers or recoiling black holes are also possible causes, which can explain the spatial offsets and the high intrinsic star formation rates in the HyLIRG quasar systems.

Testing the standard cosmological model (ΛCDM) at small scales is challenging. Galaxies that inhabit low-mass dark matter halos provide an ideal test bed for dark matter models by linking observational properties of galaxies at small scales (low mass, low velocity) to low-mass dark matter halos. However, the observed kinematics of these galaxies do not align with the kinematics of the dark matter halos predicted to host them, obscuring our understanding of the low-mass end of the galaxy–halo connection. We use deep H i observations of low-mass galaxies at high spectral resolution in combination with cosmological simulations of dwarf galaxies to better understand the connection between dwarf galaxy kinematics and low-mass halos. Specifically, we use H i line widths to directly compare to the maximum velocities in a dark matter halo and find that each deeper measurement approaches the expected one-to-one relationship between the observed kinematics and the predicted kinematics in ΛCDM. We also measure baryonic masses and place these on the baryonic Tully–Fisher relation (BTFR). Again, our deepest measurements approach the theoretical predictions for the low-mass end of this relation, a significant improvement on similar measurements based on line widths measured at 50% and 20% of the peak. Our data also hint at the rollover in the BTFR predicted by hydrodynamical simulations of ΛCDM for low-mass galaxies.

We conducted 3D numerical simulations of binary star accretion via a circumbinary disk, taking into account a magnetic field perpendicular to the disk and an infalling envelope. Our simulations reproduce the following phenomena: (1) the spiral arms associated with circumstellar disks; (2) the turbulence in the circumbinary disk, induced by magnetorotational instability (MRI); (3) a fast outflow launched from each circumstellar disk; and (4) a slow outflow from the circumbinary disk. The binary models exhibit a higher α-parameter than the corresponding single-star models, indicating that the binary stars enhance the MRI turbulence. Moreover, an infalling envelope also enhances the turbulence, leading to a high α-parameter. While the spiral arms promote radial flow, causing the transfer of mass and angular momentum within the circumbinary disk, the MRI turbulence and outflows are the main drivers of angular momentum transfer to reduce the specific angular momentum of the system.

<br />
这篇文章报告了对2FHL J1745.1–3035进行的多时期、多天文台的X射线分析。该源在50 GeV以上具有非常硬的γ射线光子指数，Γγ = 1.2 ± 0.4，并被Fermi-LAT发现为TeV辐射体。通过联合XMM-Newton、Chandra和NuSTAR观测，使用超过20年的存档XMM-Newton观测，研究了2FHL J1745.1–3035的X射线光谱特性。联合X射线光谱显示最佳拟合为带有断裂功率定律模型，断裂能量Eb∼7keV：在10keV以下的能量范围内，该源非常硬，Γ1∼0.6，在NuSTAR测量的更高能量范围内显著变软，Γ2∼1.9。通过Chandra进行了空间分辨的X射线分析，发现了边缘延展的证据（最多达到角尺寸r∼5″），这一结果支持了紧凑脉冲星风星云的情形。根据X射线和γ射线特性，2FHL J1745.1–3035是一个有力的脉冲星风星云候选体。由于其作为极端TeV辐射体的特性，进一步得到了HESS J1745-303的TeV延展源的探测支持，2FHL J1745.1–3035是未来使用切伦科夫望远镜阵的理想候选体。 <br /><br />总结: 多时期的X射线分析显示2FHL J1745.1–3035具有极端的γ射线光子指数和TeV发射特性；X射线光谱表明其可能是一个脉冲星风星云候选体；同时与TeV延展源HESS J1745-303的探测结果相吻合，值得进一步使用切伦科夫望远镜阵进行跟踪观测。 <div>
We present a multi-epoch, multi-observatory X-ray analysis for 2FHL J1745.1–3035, a newly discovered very high-energy Galactic source detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) located in close proximity to the Galactic Center (l = 358.°5319; b = −0.°7760). The source shows a very hard γ-ray photon index above 50 GeV, Γγ = 1.2 ± 0.4, and is found to be a TeV emitter by the Fermi–LAT. We conduct a joint XMM-Newton, Chandra, and NuSTAR observing campaign, combining archival XMM-Newton observations, to study the X-ray spectral properties of 2FHL J1745.1–3035 over a time span of over 20 yr. The joint X-ray spectrum is best fitted as a broken-power-law model with break energy Eb ∼ 7 keV: the source is very hard at energies below 10 keV, with Γ1 ∼ 0.6, and significantly softer in the higher energy range measured by NuSTAR with Γ2 ∼ 1.9. We also perform a spatially resolved X-ray analysis with Chandra, finding evidence for marginal extension (up to an angular size r ∼ 5″), a result that supports a compact pulsar wind nebula scenario. Based on the X-ray and γ-ray properties, 2FHL J1745.1–3035 is a powerful pulsar wind nebula candidate. Given its nature as an extreme TeV emitter, further supported by the detection of a coincident TeV extended source HESS J1745-303, 2FHL J1745.1–3035 is an ideal candidate for a follow up with the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array.

<br /><br />总结:
该研究报道了对25个尚未重复的快速无线电爆发（FRBs）进行的全极化分析，这些FRB是在1.4 GHz上由110天线深度综合阵列（DSA-110）在委托观测期间检测到的。文章介绍了针对这一新型设备开发的数据降噪、校准和分析程序的细节。研究结果显示，20个FRBs在±106 rad m−2范围内具有法拉第旋转测量值（RMs），其中15个FRBs与100%极化一致，10个具有高（≥70%）线偏极化分数，2个具有高（≥30%）圆偏极化分数。结果不支持多路径RM散射作为主要解极化机制。与先前发表的FRB极化测量相结合后，研究比较了FRB子种群和银河脉冲星的极化特性。研究支持了一种情况，即FRB发射本质上是高度线偏极化的，传播效应可以导致圆偏极化和解极化。年轻的脉冲星发射和磁层传播几何形态可能对FRB极化的起源形成有用的类比。 <div>
We report on a full-polarization analysis of the first 25 as yet nonrepeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected at 1.4 GHz by the 110-antenna Deep Synoptic Array (DSA-110) during commissioning observations. We present details of the data-reduction, calibration, and analysis procedures developed for this novel instrument. Faraday rotation measures (RMs) are searched between ±106 rad m−2 and detected for 20 FRBs, with magnitudes ranging from 4 to 4670 rad m−2. Fifteen out of 25 FRBs are consistent with 100% polarization, 10 of which have high (≥70%) linear-polarization fractions and two of which have high (≥30%) circular-polarization fractions. Our results disfavor multipath RM scattering as a dominant depolarization mechanism. Polarization-state and possible RM variations are observed in the four FRBs with multiple subcomponents. We combine the DSA-110 sample with polarimetry of previously published FRBs, and compare the polarization properties of FRB subpopulations and FRBs with Galactic pulsars. Although FRB polarization fractions are typically higher than those of Galactic pulsars, and cover a wider range than those of pulsar single pulses, they resemble those of the youngest (characteristic ages <105 yr) pulsars. Our results support a scenario wherein FRB emission is intrinsically highly linearly polarized, and propagation effects can result in conversion to circular polarization and depolarization. Young pulsar emission and magnetospheric propagation geometries may form a useful analogy for the origin of FRB polarization.

<title>The Fate of the Interstellar Medium in Early-type Galaxies. III. The Mechanism of Interstellar Medium Removal and the Quenching of Star Formation</title>

<div> ETGs, quenching, cold ISM, star formation, SFE
<br /><br />总结:
本研究探讨了早期星系（ETGs）中恒星形成的抑制机制。研究发现，ETGs中冷间星介质（ISM）的减少速度与尘埃、分子和原子气体的减少速度相似，排除了一系列潜在的ISM消除机制，表明低质量恒星的电离和/或超新星引起的电离/流出可能是主要机制。此外，研究还提供了内部产生的ISM的证据，并发现星系中恒星形成的抑制不能仅通过气体量的减少来解释，因为SFR的下降速度比冷气体的减少速度更快，而星系的SFE低于恒星形成星系的SFE，可能是由于气体的稳定性增强。 <div>
Understanding how galaxies quench their star formation is crucial for studies of galaxy evolution. Quenching is related to a decrease of cold gas. In the first paper we showed that the dust removal timescale in early-type galaxies (ETGs) is about 2.5 Gyr. Here we present carbon monoxide and 21 cm hydrogen line observations of these galaxies and measure the timescale of removal of the cold interstellar medium (ISM). We find that all the cold ISM components (dust and molecular and atomic gas) decline at similar rates. This allows us to rule out a wide range of potential ISM-removal mechanisms (including starburst-driven outflows, astration, or a decline in the number of asymptotic giant branch stars), and artificial effects like the stellar mass–age correlation, environmental influence, mergers, and selection bias, leaving ionization by evolved low-mass stars and ionization/outflows by Type Ia supernovae or active galactic nuclei as viable mechanisms. We also provide evidence for an internal origin of the detected ISMs. Moreover, we find that the quenching of star formation in these galaxies cannot be explained by a reduction in the gas amount alone, because the star formation rates (SFRs) decrease faster (on a timescale of about 1.8 Gyr) than the amount of cold gas. Furthermore, the star formation efficiency (SFE) of the ETGs ( ) is lower than that of star-forming galaxies, whereas their gas mass fractions ( ) are normal. This may be explained by the stabilization of gas against fragmentation, for example due to morphological quenching, turbulence, or magnetic fields.

<div> 关键词: Pulsar timing, algorithm, binary pulsars, Green Bank Telescope, Terzan 5

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了一个自动化的脉冲星定时算法，用于测量脉冲星的旋转频率、位置、双星参数等信息。通过应用统计F-检验和减少的χ2在最小值附近的二次依赖关系，可以高效而系统地确定脉冲星的全局旋转计数。作者使用这个算法在Terzan 5球状星团的两颗新发现的双星脉冲星PSR J1748−2446aq和J1748−2446at上建立了定时解决方案，利用了过去13年的约70次Green Bank Telescope观测。 <div>
Pulsar timing is a powerful tool that, by accounting for every rotation of a pulsar, precisely measures the spin frequency, spin frequency derivatives, astrometric position, binary parameters when applicable, properties of the interstellar medium, and potentially general relativistic effects. Typically, this process demands fairly stringent scheduling requirements for monitoring observations as well as deep domain knowledge to “phase connect” the timing data. We present an algorithm that automates the pulsar-timing process for binary pulsars, whose timing solutions have an additional level of complexity, although the algorithm works for isolated pulsars as well. Using the statistical F-test and the quadratic dependence of the reduced χ2 near a minimum, the global rotation count of a pulsar can be determined efficiently and systematically. We have used our algorithm to establish timing solutions for two newly discovered binary pulsars, PSRs J1748−2446aq and J1748−2446at, in the globular cluster Terzan 5, using ∼70 Green Bank Telescope observations from the last 13 yr.

总结:<br /><br /> 这项研究使用IceCube-DeepCore数据对2268次伽马射线暴（GRBs）进行了8年的中微子探测，探索了光球以下的爆发物理过程。研究发现没有发现中微子的证据，但对GRB 221009A的分析提供了对重子装载的最具约束力的限制。相比于IceCube在太子到拍他子电子伏特能量范围内的观测，本文给出的中微子限制是一个有益的补充。 <div>
We present the results of a search for 10–1000 GeV neutrinos from 2268 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) over 8 yr of IceCube-DeepCore data. This work probes burst physics below the photosphere where electromagnetic radiation cannot escape. Neutrinos of tens of giga electronvolts are predicted in sub-photospheric collision of free-streaming neutrons with bulk-jet protons. In a first analysis, we searched for the most significant neutrino-GRB coincidence using six overlapping time windows centered on the prompt phase of each GRB. In a second analysis, we conducted a search for a group of GRBs, each individually too weak to be detectable, but potentially significant when combined. No evidence of neutrino emission is found for either analysis. The most significant neutrino coincidence is for Fermi-GBM GRB bn 140807500, with a p-value of 0.097 corrected for all trials. The binomial test used to search for a group of GRBs had a p-value of 0.65 after all trial corrections. The binomial test found a group consisting only of GRB bn 140807500 and no additional GRBs. The neutrino limits of this work complement those obtained by IceCube at tera electronvolt to peta electronvolt energies. We compare our findings for the large set of GRBs as well as GRB 221009A to the sub-photospheric neutron-proton collision model and find that GRB 221009A provides the most constraining limit on baryon loading. For a jet Lorentz factor of 300 (800), the baryon loading on GRB 221009A is lower than 3.85 (2.13) at a 90% confidence level.

总结: 本研究利用高时空分辨率的观测仪器观察到了双层磁流体力线的形成过程，发现双重爆发引发了两个磁通绳系统。观测结果表明，第一个磁通绳的爆发经历了短暂的停顿后成功喷发，而第二个磁通绳则是失败的喷发。这表明新形成的磁通绳在较高高度达到了新的平衡状态，可以被视为一个临时的双层磁通绳系统。研究结果支持了系留剪切模型，并提出了当背景日冕磁场在高度上呈现鞍状磁衰减指数分布时，两次连续的受限系留剪切喷发会自然产生双层磁通绳系统的假设。 <div>
Double-decker filaments and their eruptions have been widely observed in recent years, but their physical formation mechanism is still unclear. Using high spatiotemporal resolution, multi-wavelength observations taken by the New Vacuum Solar Telescope and the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we show the formation of a double-decker pair of flux rope system by two successive tether-cutting eruptions in a bipolar active region. Due to the combined effect of photospheric shearing and convergence motions around the active region’s polarity inversion line (PIL), the arms of two overlapping inverse-S-shaped short filaments reconnected at their intersection, which created a simultaneous upward-moving magnetic flux rope (MFR) and a downward-moving post-flare-loop (PFL) system striding the PIL. Meanwhile, four bright flare ribbons appeared at the footpoints of the newly formed MFR and the PFL. As the MFR rose, two elongated flare ribbons connected by a relatively larger PFL appeared on either side of the PIL. After a few minutes, another MFR formed in the same way at the same location and then erupted in the same direction as the first one. Detailed observational results suggest that the eruption of the first MFR might experienced a short pause before its successful eruption, while the second MFR was a failed eruption. This implies that the two newly formed MFRs might reach a new equilibrium at relatively higher heights for a while, which can be regarded as a transient double-decker flux rope system. The observations can well be explained by the tether-cutting model, and we propose that two successive confined tether-cutting eruptions can naturally produce a double-decker flux rope system, especially when the background coronal magnetic field has a saddle-like distribution of magnetic decay index profile in height.

总结:
大气层模拟包括了光与大气的相互作用，使用光子Monte Carlo方法实现。气象分布基于历史数据编译全球气候分布，垂直热力学量的自洽垂直剖面，云量和云覆盖的空间模型，以及四种气溶胶的全球分布。通过物理第一原理实现物理交互，从而产生出包括差分星差测量和椭圆点扩散函数在内的新兴图像特性。使用共同的大气层表示框架通过模拟单个光子来自洽地模拟所有现象。文章还总结了一些微妙的相关性，包括温度与背景和差分星差测量的反相关性，湿度与月背景的相关性，PSF翼与云深度的相关性，背景与云深度的反相关性，以及月背景与云深度的相关性。 <div>
We present a self-consistent representation of the atmosphere and implement the interactions of light with the atmosphere using a photon Monte Carlo approach. We compile global climate distributions based on historical data, self-consistent vertical profiles of thermodynamic quantities, spatial models of cloud variation and cover, and global distributions of four kinds of aerosols. We then implement refraction, Rayleigh scattering, molecular interactions, and Tyndall–Mie scattering to all photons emitted from astronomical sources and various background components using physics first principles. This results in emergent image properties that include: differential astrometry and elliptical point spread functions (PSFs) predicted completely to the horizon, arcminute-scale spatial-dependent photometry variations at 20 mmag for short exposures, excess background spatial variations at 0.2% due to the atmosphere, and a PSF wing due to water droplets. We use a common atmosphere representation framework to self-consistently model all phenomena by simulating individual photons. We reproduce the well-known correlations in image characteristics: correlations in altitude with absolute photometry (overall transmission) and relative photometry (spectrally dependent transmission), anticorrelations of altitude with differential astrometry (nonideal astrometric patterns) and background levels, and an anticorrelation in absolute photometry with cloud depth. However, we also find further subtle correlations including an anticorrelation of temperature with background and differential astrometry, a correlation of temperature with absolute and relative photometry, an anticorrelation of absolute photometry with humidity, a correlation of humidity with lunar background, a significant correlation of PSF wing with cloud depth, an anticorrelation of background with cloud depth, and a correlation of lunar background with cloud depth.

We analyze and compare the satellite halo populations at z ∼ 2 in the high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of a 1012M⊙ target halo (z = 0 mass) carried out on eight widely used astrophysical simulation codes (Art-I, Enzo, Ramses, Changa, Gadget-3, Gear, Arepo-t, and Gizmo) for the AGORA High-resolution Galaxy Simulations Comparison Project. We use slightly different redshift epochs near z = 2 for each code (hereafter “z ∼ 2”) at which the eight simulations are in the same stage in the target halo’s merger history. After identifying the matched pairs of halos between the CosmoRun simulations and the DMO simulations, we discover that each CosmoRun halo tends to be less massive than its DMO counterpart. When we consider only the halos containing stellar particles at z ∼ 2, the number of satellite galaxies is significantly fewer than that of dark matter halos in all participating AGORA simulations and is comparable to the number of present-day satellites near the Milky Way or M31. The so-called “missing satellite problem” is fully resolved across all participating codes simply by implementing the common baryonic physics adopted in AGORA and the stellar feedback prescription commonly used in each code, with sufficient numerical resolution (≲100 proper pc at z = 2). We also compare other properties such as the stellar mass–halo mass relation and the mass–metallicity relation. Our work highlights the value of comparison studies such as AGORA, where outstanding problems in galaxy formation theory are studied simultaneously on multiple numerical platforms.

本研究使用了Newman-Janis算法构建了在f(R) scalaron引力理论中的一个轴对称渐近平坦度量，即Kerr-scalaron度量。通过使用紧凑型恒星轨道和黑洞影子来研究新度量的天文学后果。研究发现，质量在10^-17 - 10^-16 eV范围内的scalaron与观测到的发射环尺寸相符。新度量能够复制S2等星体轨道的Schwarzschild极近点位移，并且scalaron对于小于45天文单位的轨道具有支配性的Schwarzschild进动。新度量下的Lense-Thirring(LT)进动在S2轨道内的幅度为(12.25-24.5) μas yr^-1，并且进动时间尺度与S星体的年龄非常接近。 <div>
Astronomical tests of spacetime metric and gravitation theory near the Galactic center (GC) black hole, Sgr A*, have gained momentum with the observations of compact stellar orbits near the black hole and measurement of the black hole shadow. Deviation from the Kerr metric is a potential signature of modified gravity theory. In this work, we use the Newman–Janis algorithm to construct an axially symmetric and asymptotically flat metric in f(R) scalaron gravity theory. We call it the Kerr-scalaron metric. To study the astronomical consequences of the new metric, we use the compact stellar orbits and the black hole shadow. We use the observed size of the emission ring of the GC black hole shadow for estimating the deviation of the new metric from general relativity. It has been found that scalarons with masses within 10−17–10−16 eV are compatible with the observed emission ring size for a black hole spin of χ = 0.9. The Schwarzschild limit of the pericenter shift is estimated for compact stellar orbits near the black hole. General relativistic pericenter shift in wider orbits, including S stars such as S4716 and S2, has been reproduced with these scalarons. The parameter fSP measuring the deviation from Schwarzschild pericenter shift has been found to be fSP = 1.00–1.04 within stellar orbits with semimajor axes of 45–100 au. Scalarons have the capability to dominate Schwarzschild precession for orbits with semimajor axes much smaller than 45 au. Lense–Thirring (LT) precession with the new metric is estimated for the compact orbits. The massive scalarons produce LT precession with magnitude (12.25–24.5) μas yr−1 in the orbit of S2. The LT precession timescale is within 0.1% of the age of the S stars.

All-sky maps of the thermal Sunyaev–Zel’dovich effect (SZ) tend to suffer from systematic features arising from the component-separation techniques used to extract the signal. In this work, we investigate one of these methods, known as needlet internal linear combination (NILC), and test its performance on simulated data. We show that NILC estimates are strongly affected by the choice of the spatial localization parameter (Γ), which controls a bias-variance trade-off. Typically, NILC extractions assume a fixed value of Γ over the entire sky, but we show there exists an optimal Γ that depends on the SZ signal strength and local contamination properties. Then we calculate the NILC solutions for multiple values of Γ and feed the results into a neural network to predict the SZ signal. This extraction method, which we call Deep-NILC, is tested against a set of validation data, including recovered radial profiles of resolved systems. Our main result is that Deep-NILC offers significant improvements over choosing fixed values of Γ.

<div> 重复爆发（FRB），光学观测，‘Alopeke相机，Gemini-North望远镜，射电流量<br />
这项研究利用Gemini-North望远镜上的‘Alopeke相机对两次重复爆发（FRB 20201023和FRB 20220908）进行了光学观测，发现没有显著的光学检测。研究结果显示，FRB 20180916B的光学与射电流量比率（ην）的上限为3 × 10−3，比以往的测量结果高出一个数量级。这些测量结果排除了一些FRB的天体模型，例如和蟹状星云脉冲星类似的模型，或者光学辐射在脉冲星磁层或年轻超新星遗迹中产生的逆康普顿辐射。我们将继续使用Gemini-North望远镜上的‘Alopeke相机对重复FRB进行监测，寻找毫秒量级的光学对应体。 <br /><br />总结：本研究利用‘Alopeke相机在Gemini-North望远镜上对两次重复爆发进行了光学观测，未发现显著的光学信号，同时得出了对FRB 20180916B光学与射频流量比率的上限。这些测量结果排除了一些可能的天体模型，并强调了继续寻找毫秒量级光学对应体的重要性。 <div>
We report on contemporaneous optical observations at ≈10 ms timescales from the fast radio burst (FRB) 20180916B of two repeat bursts (FRB 20201023 and FRB 20220908) taken with the ‘Alopeke camera on the Gemini-North telescope. These repeats have radio fluences of 2.8 and 3.5 Jy ms, respectively, approximately in the lower 50th percentile for fluence from this repeating burst. The ‘Alopeke data reveal no significant optical detections at the FRB position and we place 3σ upper limits to the optical fluences of <8.3 × 10−3 and <7.7 × 10−3 Jy ms after correcting for line-of-sight extinction. Together, these yield the most sensitive limits to the optical-to-radio fluence ratio of an FRB on these timescales with ην < 3 × 10−3 by roughly an order of magnitude. These measurements rule out progenitor models where FRB 20180916B has a similar fluence ratio to optical pulsars, such as the Crab pulsar, or where optical emission is produced as inverse-Compton radiation in a pulsar magnetosphere or young supernova remnant. Our ongoing program with ‘Alopeke on Gemini-North will continue to monitor repeating FRBs, including FRB 20180916B, to search for optical counterparts on millisecond timescales.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究调查了星系从星系主序到被动状态时分子气体和星形成特性的变化。研究发现随着星系从主序向绿谷过渡，比较于主序星系，特定星形成率表面密度（ΣsSFR）的径向分布在1.5 Re的星系中心半径范围内被抑制。通过结合气体分数（fgas）和星形成效率（SFE）的径向分布，我们可以识别出确定不同星系中ΣsSFR的潜在机制。分析fgas和SFE对ΣsSFR的相对贡献揭示了多种抑制模式。大约一半的抑制星系的星形成主要受单一模式（即fgas或SFE）或两者的组合驱动。对所有星系的集体分析显示，在中心区域（R < 0.5 Re）内的星形成减少主要归因于SFE的下降。相反，在盘区域（R > 0.5 Re），fgas和SFE都对星形成的抑制有所贡献。我们的发现表明在我们的样本星系中可能存在多种抑制机制，甚至在单个星系内也是如此。我们还将我们的观测结果与星系模拟进行了比较，并讨论了我们数据的影响。 <div>
Star formation quenching is one of the key processes that shape the evolution of galaxies. In this study, we investigate the changes in molecular gas and star formation properties as galaxies transit from the star-forming main sequence to the passive regime. Our analysis reveals that as galaxies move away from the main sequence toward the green valley the radial profile of specific star formation rate surface density (ΣsSFR) is suppressed compared with main-sequence galaxies out to a galactocentric radius of 1.5 Re(∼7 kpc for our sample). By combining radial profiles of gas fraction (fgas) and star formation efficiency (SFE), we can discern the underlying mechanism that determines ΣsSFR at different galactocentric radii. Analysis of relative contributions of fgas and SFE to ΣsSFR uncovers a diverse range of quenching modes. Star formation in approximately half of our quenching galaxies is primarily driven by a single mode (i.e., either fgas or SFE), or a combination of both. A collective analysis of all galaxies reveals that the reduction in star formation within the central regions (R < 0.5 Re) is primarily attributable to a decrease in SFE. Conversely, in the disk regions (R > 0.5 Re), both fgas and SFE contribute to the suppression of star formation. Our findings suggest that multiple quenching mechanisms may be at play in our sample galaxies, and even within a single galaxy. We also compare our observational outcomes with those from galaxy simulations and discuss the implications of our data.

<title>Dense Core Collisions in Molecular Clouds: Formation of Streamers and Binary Stars</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Dense core collisions, previously regarded as minor in star formation, are proposed to play a significant role in structure formation around protostellar envelopes and binary formation. Using archival data of nearby star-forming regions, we determine the frequencies of core collisions. Our calculations reveal that a typical core is likely to undergo multiple interactions with other cores throughout its lifetime. To further investigate the core collision process, we employ adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamic simulations with sink particles. Our simulations demonstrate that following the formation of a protostar within a gravitationally unstable core, the merging core’s accreting gas gives rise to a rotationally supported circumstellar disk. Meanwhile, the region compressed by the shock between the cores develops into asymmetric arms that connect with the disk. Gas along these arms tends to migrate inward, ultimately falling toward the protostar. One of the arms, a remnant of the shock-compressed region, dominates over the second core gas, potentially exhibiting a distinct chemical composition. This is consistent with recent findings of large-scale streamers around protostars. Additionally, we found that collisions with velocities of ∼1.5 km s−1 result in the formation of a binary system, as evidenced by the emergence of a sink particle within the dense section of the shocked layer. Overall, dense core collisions are highlighted as a critical process in creating 103 au-scale streamers around protostellar systems and binary stars.

<title>Characterizing the Gamma-Ray Emission Properties of the Globular Cluster M5 with the Fermi-LAT</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3210</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We analyzed the globular cluster M5 (NGC 5904) using 15 yr of gamma-ray data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Using rotation ephemerides generated from Arecibo and FAST radio telescope observations, we searched for gamma-ray pulsations from the seven millisecond pulsars (MSPs) identified in M5. We detected no significant pulsations from any of the individual pulsars. In addition, we searched for possible variations of the gamma-ray emission as a function of orbital phase for all six MSPs in binary systems, but we did not detect any significant modulations. The gamma-ray emission from the direction of M5 is well described by an exponentially cutoff power-law spectral model, although other models cannot be excluded. The phase-averaged emission is consistent with being steady on a timescale of a few months. We estimate the number of MSPs in M5 to be between 1 and 10, using the gamma-ray conversion efficiencies for well-characterized gamma-ray MSPs in the Third Fermi-LAT Catalog of Gamma-ray Pulsars, suggesting that the sample of known MSPs in M5 is (nearly) complete, even if it is not currently possible to rule out a diffuse component of the observed gamma rays from the cluster.

<div> pulsar binaries, multiband emission, broadband spectral energy distributions, intrabinary shock, gamma-ray emission
<br />总结:
本研究调查了脉冲星双星系统XSS J12270−4859、PSR J2039−5617和PSR J2339−0533的多波段发射，这些系统在X射线和伽马射线波段中表现出轨道调制。我们通过补充X射线测量结果与已发表的伽马射线结果，构建了源的宽带光谱能量分布和多波段轨道光变曲线，并使用了脉内冲击（IBS）情景模拟了这些数据。虽然X射线数据可通过IBS中电子/正电子的同步辐射来解释，但伽马射线数据却难以仅用IBS组分解释。因此，我们探讨了其他已被提出的脉冲星双星系统中伽马射线发射的情景：（1）上游未冲击的风区的逆康普顿发射和（2）与伴星千高斯磁场相互作用的电子/正电子的同步辐射。情景（1）要求风的整体运动在到达IBS之前显著减速至∼1000 km s−1，以增加停留时间，在这种情况下形成强激波是不可行的，与X射线现象学不一致。情景（2）可以解释数据，如果我们假设具有Lorentz因子∼ 108（∼0.1 PeV）的电子/正电子通过IBS并利用大部分脉冲星电压降。这些发现提出了脉冲星双星系统轨道调制的伽马射线信号可能为我们提供关于脉冲星风流结构和能量转化、以及脉冲星附近近PeV能量的粒子加速的见解。这些信号还可能增进我们对这些系统中低质量恒星可能拥有千高斯磁场的理解。 <div>
We investigated the multiband emission from the pulsar binaries XSS J12270−4859, PSR J2039−5617, and PSR J2339−0533, which exhibit orbital modulation in the X-ray and gamma-ray bands. We constructed the sources’ broadband spectral energy distributions and multiband orbital light curves by supplementing our X-ray measurements with published gamma-ray results, and we modeled the data using intrabinary shock (IBS) scenarios. While the X-ray data were well explained by synchrotron emission from electrons/positrons in the IBS, the gamma-ray data were difficult to explain with the IBS components alone. Therefore, we explored other scenarios that had been suggested for gamma-ray emission from pulsar binaries: (1) inverse-Compton emission in the upstream unshocked wind zone and (2) synchrotron radiation from electrons/positrons interacting with the kilogauss magnetic field of the companion. Scenario (1) requires that the bulk motion of the wind substantially decelerates to ∼1000 km s−1 before reaching the IBS for increased residence time, in which case the formation of a strong shock is untenable, inconsistent with the X-ray phenomenology. Scenario (2) can explain the data if we assume the presence of electrons/positrons with a Lorentz factor ∼ 108 (∼0.1 PeV) that pass through the IBS and tap a substantial portion of the pulsar voltage drop. These findings raise the possibility that the orbitally modulating gamma-ray signals from pulsar binaries can provide insights into the flow structure and energy conversion within pulsar winds and particle acceleration nearing PeV energies in pulsars. These signals may also yield greater understanding of kilogauss magnetic fields potentially hosted by the low-mass stars in these systems.

<div> Gaia Data Release 3, astrometry, spectroscopy, Shakti, Shiva
<br />
这篇文章使用Gaia Data Release 3的天体测量和光谱学数据研究了银河系内部的轨道-金属丰度空间中的两个新的亚结构：Shakti和Shiva。
Shakti和Shiva被识别为明亮（G < 16）且金属贫（-2.5 < [M/H] < -1.0）恒星(Lz, E)分布中的两个受限制的、高对比度的过密现象。
它们的恒星质量都大于107M⊙，并分布在银河内太阳圈内的顺行轨道上。
这两个结构在轨道空间分布上表明它们可能来自于外部的来源；然而，它们成员的丰度模式（来自于APOGEE）更像是被认为是原地形成的。
上述较矛盾的特征可以通过解释成员恒星的丰度[Mg/Fe]、[Al/Fe]、[Mg/Mn]相对于[Fe/H]的分布仅仅是快速富集的迹象来进行调和。
这可能暗示了两种可能的情景：Shakti和Shiva是由转动的巴尔对位场星体的某种方式共振轨道捕获而形成的。
或者，Shakti和Shiva是原星系的碎片，快速形成恒星并早期聚合，类似于银河系贫弱的旧核心天体，只不过在银河潜在场中更浅，并且在轨道空间中仍然可辨。

Using Gaia Data Release 3 astrometry and spectroscopy, we study two new substructures in the orbit–metallicity space of the inner Milky Way: Shakti and Shiva. They were identified as two confined, high-contrast overdensities in the (Lz, E) distribution of bright (G < 16) and metal-poor (−2.5 < [M/H] < − 1.0) stars. Both have stellar masses of M⋆ ≳ 107M⊙, and are distributed on prograde orbits inside the solar circle in the Galaxy. Both structures have an orbit-space distribution that points toward an accreted origin; however, their abundance patterns—from APOGEE—are such that are conventionally attributed to an in situ population. These seemingly contradictory diagnostics could be reconciled if we interpret the abundances [Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe], [Mg/Mn] versus [Fe/H] distribution of their member stars merely as a sign of rapid enrichment. This would then suggest one of two scenarios. Either these prograde substructures were created by some form of resonant orbit trapping of the field stars by the rotating bar; a plausible scenario proposed by Dillamore et al. Or, Shakti and Shiva were protogalactic fragments that formed stars rapidly and coalesced early, akin to the constituents of the poor old heart of the Milky Way, just less deep in the Galactic potential and still discernible in orbit space.

<div> 关键词: 星形成, 外流, 磁流体力学, 磁场, 类零星等

总结: <br /><br />这篇文章研究了外流在星形成过程中的重要性，通过高分辨率的三维嵌套网格非理想磁流体力学模拟，发现外流主要来自磁假盘，而不是来自扩展的离心盘。部分磁假盘的气体流向上升，在某些区域被磁压梯度力驱动，而在其他区域则表现出磁离心力的特征。这一外流区域的结构和动力学特性可以用重力、角动量、磁场和非理想磁流体力学的基本物理理论来解释。 <div>
Outflows play a pivotal role in star formation as one of its most visible markers and a means of transporting mass, momentum, and angular momentum from the infalling gas into the surrounding molecular cloud. Their wide reach (at least thousands of astrnomical units) is a contrast to typical disk sizes (∼10–100 au). We employ high-resolution three-dimensional nested-grid nonideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to study outflow properties in the Class 0 phase. We find that no disk wind is driven from the extended centrifugal disk that has weak magnetic coupling. The low-velocity winds emerge instead from the infalling magnetic pseudodisk. Much of the disk actually experiences an infall of matter rather than outflowing gas. Some of the pseudodisk wind (PD-wind) moves inward to regions above the disk and either falls onto the disk or proceeds upward. The upward flow gives the impression of a disk wind above a certain height even if the gas is originally emerging from the pseudodisk. The PD-wind has the strongest flow coming from a disk interaction zone that lies just outside the disk and is an interface between the inwardly advected magnetic field of the pseudodisk and the outwardly diffusing magnetic field of the disk. The low-velocity wind exhibits the features of a flow driven by the magnetic pressure gradient force in some regions and those of a magnetocentrifugal wind in other regions. We interpret the structure and dynamics of the outflow zone in terms of the basic physics of gravity, angular momentum, magnetic fields, and nonideal MHD.

总结:
太阳磁场包括闭合和开放场线，物理模型估计的开放磁通量与实际观测存在显著差异，尤其是在太阳活动最大时期。利用EUV或氦I观测的开放磁通量估计与物理模型结果一致，但与实测存在争议。本文指出差异源自开闭边界的动态。研究结果表明，靠近活跃区和中纬度极冠洞边界的强磁场是开放磁通量缺失的主要来源。这些结果解决了开放磁通量问题中的矛盾。 <div>
The solar magnetic fields emerging from the photosphere into the chromosphere and corona are comprised of a combination of closed (field lines with both ends rooted at the Sun) and open (field lines with only one end at the Sun) fields. Since the early 2000s, the magnitude of total unsigned open magnetic flux estimated by coronal models has been in significant disagreement with in situ spacecraft observations, especially during solar maximum. Estimates of total open unsigned magnetic flux using coronal hole observations (e.g., using extreme ultraviolet or helium (He) I) are in general, in average agreement with the coronal model results and thus show similar disagreements with in situ observations. This paper provides a brief overview of the problem, summarizes the proposed explanations for the discrepancies, and presents results that strongly support the explanation that the discrepancy is due to dynamics at the open-closed boundary. These results are derived from the determination of the total unsigned open magnetic flux, utilizing the Wang–Sheeley–Arge model at a particular spatial resolution and different field-line tracing methods. One of these methods produces excellent agreement with in situ observations. Our results imply that strong magnetic fields in close proximity to active regions and residing near the boundaries of mid-latitude coronal holes are the primary source of the missing open flux. Furthermore, the results outlined here resolve many of the seemingly contradictory facts that have made the open-flux problem so difficult.

We measure the bolometric luminosity of a complete and unbiased 12 μm-selected sample of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the local Universe. For each galaxy, we used a 10-band radio-to-X-ray spectral energy distribution (SED) to isolate the genuine AGN continuum in each band, including subarcsecond measurements where available, and correcting those contaminated by the host galaxy. We derive the median SED of Seyfert type 1 AGN, Seyferts with hidden broad lines (HBLs), Seyferts of type 2, and LINER nuclei in our sample. The median Seyfert 1 SED shows the characteristic blue bump feature in the UV, but nevertheless, the largest contribution to the bolometric luminosity comes from the IR and X-ray continua. The median SEDs of both HBL and type 2 AGN are affected by starlight contamination in the optical/UV. The median SED of HBL AGN is consistent with that of Seyfert 1s, when an extinction of AV ∼ 1.2 mag is applied. The comprehensive SEDs allowed us to measure accurate bolometric luminosities and derive robust bolometric corrections for the different tracers. The 12 μm and K-band nuclear luminosities have good linear correlations with the bolometric luminosity, similar to those in the X-rays. We derive bolometric corrections for either continuum bands (K band, 12 μm, 2–10 keV, and 14–195 keV) or narrow emission lines (mid-IR high-ionization lines of [O iv] and [Ne v] and optical [O iii] 5007 Å) as well as for combinations of IR continuum and line emission. A combination of continuum plus line emission accurately predicts the bolometric luminosity up to quasar luminosities (∼1046 erg s−1).

Solar energetic particle (SEP) events have been observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) spacecraft since its launch in 2018. These events include sources from solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The IS⊙IS instrument suite on board PSP is measuring ions over energies from ∼ 20 keV nucleon−1 to 200 MeV nucleon−1 and electrons from ∼ 20 keV to 6 MeV. Previous studies sought to group CME characteristics based on their plasma conditions and arrived at general descriptions with large statistical errors, leaving open questions on how to properly group CMEs based solely on their plasma conditions. To help resolve these open questions, the plasma properties of CMEs have been examined in relation to SEPs. Here, we reexamine one plasma property, the solar wind proton temperature, and compare it to the proton SEP intensity in a region immediately downstream of a CME-driven shock for seven CMEs observed at radial distances within 1 au. We find a statistically strong correlation between proton SEP intensity and bulk proton temperature, indicating a clear relationship between SEPs and the conditions in the solar wind. Furthermore, we propose that an indirect coupling of SEP intensity to the level of turbulence and the amount of energy dissipation that results is mainly responsible for the observed correlation between SEP intensity and proton temperature. These results are key to understanding the interaction of SEPs with the bulk solar wind in CME-driven shocks and will improve our ability to model the interplay of shock evolution and particle acceleration.

总结:<br />
这篇文章讨论了光子灯笼的潜力，其可以通过单模纤维的干涉将望远镜光转换为多个单模光束，并通过相位调制实现相干成像。通过数值模拟发现，光子灯笼的干涉观测在小角度尺度上表现出类似分离孔径的可见度，对对称性更敏感，并能打破相位角度退化。通过模拟观测发现，光子灯笼在光子噪声有限的情况下和低对比度的小角度尺度解决方案方面具有显著优势，空间滤波可以提供对波前误差的稳定性。 <div>
Photonic lanterns (PLs) are tapered waveguides that gradually transition from a multimode fiber geometry to a bundle of single-mode fibers (SMFs). They can efficiently couple multimode telescope light into a multimode fiber entrance at the focal plane and convert it into multiple single-mode beams. Thus, each SMF samples its unique mode (lantern principal mode) of the telescope light in the pupil, analogous to subapertures in aperture masking interferometry (AMI). Coherent imaging with PLs can be enabled by the interference of SMF outputs and applying phase modulation, which can be achieved using a photonic chip beam combiner at the backend (e.g., the ABCD beam combiner). In this study, we investigate the potential of coherent imaging by the interference of SMF outputs of a PL with a single telescope. We demonstrate that the visibilities that can be measured from a PL are mutual intensities incident on the pupil weighted by the cross correlation of a pair of lantern modes. From numerically simulated lantern principal modes of a 6-port PL, we find that interferometric observables using a PL behave similarly to separated-aperture visibilities for simple models on small angular scales (<λ/D) but with greater sensitivity to symmetries and capability to break phase angle degeneracies. Furthermore, we present simulated observations with wave front errors (WFEs) and compare them to AMI. Despite the redundancy caused by extended lantern principal modes, spatial filtering offers stability to WFEs. Our simulated observations suggest that PLs may offer significant benefits in the photon-noise-limited regime and in resolving small angular scales at the low-contrast regime.

<div> Photospheric faculae, solar magnetic field, spatiotemporal distribution, active longitudes, crisscross patterns<br />
<br />
研究利用德布勒森太阳面斑数据库的数据，探究了2010年5月1日至2014年12月31日之间光球面斑的时空分布。研究发现，在低纬度处，存在在特定卡林顿经度出现的高丰度光球面斑，这被解释为活跃经度的存在。在高纬度处，发现了所谓的交叉图案在光球面斑出现。这些图案很可能是位于超粒界限的区域的光球面斑所致。最后，还识别出数据集中的各种振荡现象，包括与准双年振荡一致的较长周期范围以及具有4-12天周期的较短周期。我们的发现得到了一个简单启发式思想实验和更复杂的发电机模拟的支持，从而加强了对所观察到的太阳现象的解释。 <br /><br />总结: 光球面斑是太阳磁场的标志，其分布在不同纬度和经度上呈现出不同的特征，包括活跃经度和交叉图案，同时还存在着不同的周期性振荡现象。研究通过实验和模拟加强了对这些太阳现象的解释。 <div>
Photospheric faculae are markers of the solar magnetic field, appearing as bright regions along the edges of granules on the Sun’s surface. Using data from the Debrecen Solar Faculae Database, we investigated the spatiotemporal distribution of photospheric faculae between 2010 May 1 and 2014 December 31 and found the following. (i) At lower latitudes, there is an enhanced abundance of faculae appearing as stripes at given Carrington longitudes, which are interpreted as indicative of the presence of active longitudes. (ii) At higher latitudes, we identified so-called crisscross patterns of facular appearance. These patterns are likely the result of faculae in regions situated along the boundaries of supergranules. Last but not least, (iii) various periods of oscillatory phenomena were identified in this facular data set, including a longer periodic range consistent with the quasi-biennial oscillations and shorter ones with periods of 4–12 days. Our findings are supported by the visualization of a simple heuristic thought experiment and more complex dynamo simulations, strengthening the proposed interpretation of the three observed solar phenomena reported.

<div> 磁流体力学，黑洞吸积盘，中子星合并残留物，相对论，r-过程<br />
总结:<br />
研究发现磁场强度对中子星合并残留物的中心引擎有重要影响，不同的磁场强度会导致不同的物质喷射情况，产生不同的r-过程元素丰度模式。对磁场强度的改变也会影响物质喷射的几何形状，暗示着复杂的中心引擎动力学在影响镧系元素的喷射过程。特别是，在actinide产生方面，磁场强度特别敏感，一倍增的磁场强度可能导致1个亿年后残余物中的actinide质量分数增加6倍以上。这可能与金属贫瘠的、r-过程增强型恒星中actinide增强的可变性相关联。 <div>
Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence drives the central engine of post-merger remnants, potentially powering both a nucleosynthetically active disk wind and the relativistic jet behind a short gamma-ray burst. We explore the impact of the magnetic field on this engine by simulating three post-merger black hole accretion disks using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics with Monte Carlo neutrino transport, in each case varying the initial magnetic field strength. We find increasing ejecta masses associated with increasing magnetic field strength. We find that a fairly robust main r-process pattern is produced in all three cases, scaled by the ejected mass. Changing the initial magnetic field strength has a considerable effect on the geometry of the outflow and hints at complex central engine dynamics influencing lanthanide outflows. We find that actinide production is especially sensitive to magnetic field strength, with the overall actinide mass fraction calculated at 1 Gyr post-merger increasing by more than a factor of 6 with a tenfold increase in magnetic field strength. This hints at a possible connection to the variability in actinide enhancements exhibited by metal-poor, r-process-enhanced stars.

总结: <br />研究发现在mid-K-dwarf ϵ Indi A中检测到了类太阳振荡，使其成为已测量振荡的最冷的矮星。通过两次径向速度观测活动，使用高分辨率光谱仪HARPS（2011）和UVES（2021），计算功率谱并确定在5265±110μHz处存在功率过剩，这是迄今在任何恒星中测量到的最高频率的类太阳振荡。根据比例关系和干涉测量的已知半径，测得了0.782±0.023 M⊙的恒星质量，并确定了峰值功率的幅度。此外，还注意到两次观测活动水平略有差异。这项工作证实了可以在使用高精度光谱仪获得的径向速度测量中检测到mid-K型恒星的低振幅类太阳振荡。 <div>
We have detected solar-like oscillations in the mid-K-dwarf ϵ Indi A, making it the coolest dwarf to have measured oscillations. The star is noteworthy for harboring a pair of brown dwarf companions and a Jupiter-type planet. We observed ϵ Indi A during two radial velocity campaigns, using the high-resolution spectrographs HARPS (2011) and UVES (2021). Weighting the time series, we computed the power spectra and established the detection of solar-like oscillations with a power excess located at 5265 ± 110 μHz—the highest frequency solar-like oscillations so far measured in any star. The measurement of the center of the power excess allows us to compute a stellar mass of 0.782 ± 0.023 M⊙ based on scaling relations and a known radius from interferometry. We also determine the amplitude of the peak power and note that there is a slight difference between the two observing campaigns, indicating a varying activity level. Overall, this work confirms that low-amplitude solar-like oscillations can be detected in mid-K-type stars in radial velocity measurements obtained with high-precision spectrographs.

<div> 太阳，射电爆发，电子密度，紫外成像，日冕环路
<br />
太阳型号J射电爆发是III型爆发的一种变体，可用于理解太阳能电子和局部电子密度。本研究调查了2017年9月9日的J型爆发事件。通过将极紫外成像（EUV）和EUV成像光谱仪（EIS）的数据相结合，来分析该事件。在4分钟内，出现了几次形态相似的J型爆发。我们详细研究了其中两次，发现它们之间的不同谐波频带之间存在2±0.5秒的延迟。在J型爆发期间，只有一个日冕环路的北脚点明显变亮，与不断喷发的喷流连续注入环路的行为相关。明亮脚点的EUV强度与245MHz和410MHz的射电通量呈0.2和0.4的相关系数。这些观察结果表明J型爆发可能起源于这个日冕环路。通过分析从EIS数据诊断的沿着日冕环路的电子数密度分布和从J型爆发计算出的等离子体频率的时间演化，我们确定激发这两次J型爆发的高能电子的速度分别为0.10±0.02c和0.12±0.02c。我们的结果证实了先前对J型爆发的研究。
<br /><br />总结: 本研究通过对2017年9月9日的太阳型号J射电爆发事件进行分析，发现了这种爆发的一些特征和规律。通过对电子密度、紫外强度、射电通量等数据的观察和分析，确定了J型爆发起源和相关的物理过程。这为太阳活动和紫外爆发的研究提供了重要的观测和分析依据。 <div>
The solar type J radio burst is a variant of type III bursts, which are a probe for understanding solar energetic electrons and local electron density. This study investigates a type J burst event on 2017 September 9. We have combined the data from the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) imaging and the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) to analyze the event. Within 4 minutes several type J bursts with similar morphology occur. Two of them, with clear fundamental and second harmonic bands, are studied in detail. We find a delay of 2 ± 0.5 s between their different harmonic bands. During type J bursts, only one coronal loop brightens significantly at its northern footpoint, in correlation with the continuous injection of erupting jets into the loop. The EUV intensity of the brightening footpoint is correlated with the radio flux at 245 and 410 MHz, with correlation coefficients of 0.2 and 0.4, respectively. These observations suggest that the type J bursts should originate from this coronal loop. By analyzing the electron number density distribution along the coronal loop diagnosed from the EIS data and the time evolution of the plasma frequency calculated from the type J burst, we determine that the velocities of the energetic electrons exciting the two type Js are 0.10 ± 0.02c and 0.12 ± 0.02c. Our results confirm previous studies on type J bursts.

<title>Anomalous Emission from Li- and Na-like Ions in the Corona Heated via Alfvén Waves</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad283d</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The solar ultraviolet intensities of spectral lines originating from Li- and Na-like ions have been observed to surpass the expectations derived from plasmas with coronal approximation. The violation of the coronal approximation can be partially attributed to nonequilibrium ionization (NEI) due to dynamic processes occurring in the vicinity of the transition region. To investigate the impact of these dynamics in the Alfvén wave-heated coronal loop, a set of equations governing NEI for multiple ion species was solved numerically in conjunction with 1.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic equations. Following the injection of Alfvén waves from the photosphere, the system undergoes a time evolution characterized by phases of evaporation, condensation, and quasi-steady states. During the evaporation phase, the ionization fractions of Li- and Na-like ions were observed to increase when compared to the fractions in ionization equilibrium, which led to an enhancement in the intensity of up to 1.6. This over-fractionation of Li- and Na-like ions was found to be induced by the evaporation process. While collisions between shocks and the transition region temporarily led to deviations from ionization equilibrium, on average over time, these deviations were negligible. Conversely, under-fractions of the ionization fraction led to a reduction in intensity down to 0.9 during the condensation phase and the quasi-steady state. Given the dependency of the over/under-fractionation on mass circulations between the chromosphere and the corona, these observations will serve as valuable benchmarks to validate not only Alfvén wave models but also other existing mechanisms on coronal heating.

The Mg ii k and h line intensity ratios can be used to probe the characteristics of the plasma in the solar atmosphere. In this study, using the observations recorded by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer, we study the variation of the Mg ii k and h intensity ratio for three flares belonging to X-class, M-class, and C-class, throughout their evolution. We also study the k-to-h intensity ratio as a function of magnetic flux density obtained from the line-of-sight magnetograms recorded by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Our results reveal that, while the intensity ratios are independent of magnetic flux density, they show significant changes during the evolution of the C-class and M-class flares. The intensity ratios start to increase at the start of the flare and peak during the impulsive phase before the flare peak and decrease rapidly thereafter. The values of the ratios fall even below the preflare level during the peak and decline phases of the flare. These results are important in light of heating and cooling of localized plasma and provide further constraint on the understanding of flare physics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We discuss the possibility of enhancing intelligent life searches toward the Galactic center. From the clockwork orbital motions of stars around the Sgr A* black hole, we can determine the distance to the Galactic center at an exceptional accuracy, despite its remoteness ∼8.3 kpc. In addition, we can define precise reference epochs by selecting a prominent object such as the bright B-type star S2. These properties have a particular affinity for the coordinated signaling scheme that was hypothesized by Seto for systematically connecting intentional senders to searchers without a prior communication. If S2 is actually being used as a common reference clock, we can compress the search directions around the Galactic center by more than 2 orders of magnitude, with the scanning interval of ∼16 yr.

We present a UV to millimeter spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis of 16 hyperluminous, dust-obscured quasars at z ∼ 3, selected by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. We aim to investigate the physical properties of these quasars, with a focus on their molecular gas content. We decompose the SEDs into three components: stellar, cold dust, and active galactic nucleus (AGN). By doing so, we are able to derive and analyze the relevant properties of each component. We determine the molecular gas mass from CO line emission based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations. By including ALMA observations in the multiwavelength SED analysis, we derive the molecular gas fractions, gas depletion timescales, and star formation efficiencies (SFEs). Their sample median and 16th–84th quartile ranges are , tdepl ∼ Myr, and SFE ∼ K km s−1 pc−2, respectively. Compared to main-sequence galaxies, they have lower molecular gas content and higher SFEs, similar to quasars in the literature. This suggests that the gas in these quasars is rapidly depleted, likely as the result of intense starburst activity and AGN feedback. The observed correlations between these properties and the AGN luminosities further support this scenario. Additionally, we infer the black hole to stellar mass ratio and black hole mass growth rate, which indicate significant central black hole mass assembly over short timescales. Our results are consistent with the scenario that our sample represents a short transition phase toward unobscured quasars.

State-of-the-art surveys reveal that most massive stars in the Universe evolve in close binaries. Massive stars in such systems are expected to develop aspherical envelopes due to tidal interactions and/or rotational effects. Recently, it was shown that point explosions in oblate stars can produce relativistic equatorial ring-like outflows. Moreover, since stripped-envelope stars in binaries can expand enough to fill their Roche lobes anew, it is likely that these stars die with a greater degree of asphericity than the oblate spheroid geometry previously studied. We investigate the effects of this asymmetry by studying the gas dynamics of axisymmetric point explosions in stars in various stages of filling their Roche lobes. We find that point explosions in these pear-shaped stars produce transrelativistic ejecta that coalesce into bullets pointed both toward and away from the binary companion. We present this result and comment on key morphological differences between core-collapse explosions in spherical versus distorted stars in binary systems, effects on gravitational wave sources, and observational signatures that could be used to glean these explosion geometries from current and future surveys.

总结:<br /><br />该研究利用Gaia Data Release 3的数据结合LAMOST光谱调查，发现了三个可能包含紧凑天体的宽双星系统。其中两个系统的光谱显示主序伴星，没有额外的成分，因此推测其中存在紧凑天体。第三个系统的可见星是一个被剥夺了外部气层的巨星，但光谱中未观测到发射线。该系统可能含有一个大质量的白矮星或中子星，但不能排除是F型矮星的可能性。此外，对包含白矮星或中子星的大约10个双星系统进行的运动学和化学分析表明，这些系统大多位于银河系的薄盘内。 <div>
The Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) mission has identified and provided about 440,000 binary systems with orbital solutions, offering a valuable resource for searching binaries including a compact component. By combining the Gaia DR3 data with radial velocities from the LAMOST spectroscopic survey, we identify three wide binaries possibly containing a compact object. For two of these sources with a main-sequence companion, no obvious excess is observed in the blue/red band of the Gaia DR3 XP spectra, and the LAMOST medium-resolution spectra exhibit clear single-lined features. The absence of an additional component from spectral disentangling analysis further suggests the presence of compact objects within these systems. On the other hand, the visible star of the third source is a stripped giant star. In contrast to most binaries including stripped stars, no emission line is detected in the optical spectra. The unseen star could potentially be a massive white dwarf or neutron star, but the possibility of an F-type dwarf star scenario cannot be ruled out. An examination of about 10 binaries containing white dwarfs or neutron stars using both kinematic and chemical methods suggests most of these systems are located in the thin disk of the Milky Way.

The solar wind electrons carry a significant heat flux into the heliosphere. The weakly collisional state of the solar wind implicates collisionless processes as the primary factor that constrains nonthermal features of the velocity distribution function (VDF), including the heat flux. Previous observational work suggests that the electron VDF sometimes becomes unstable to the whistler wave, but reliance on model VDFs (e.g., drifting bi-Maxwellians) has proven insufficient for an exact description of the behavior of the solar wind electrons—in particular, the regulation of the heat flux. The characterization of these processes requires methods to obtain fine details of the VDF and quantification of the impact of kinetic processes on the VDF. We employ measurements of the electron VDF by Solar Orbiter’s Solar Wind Analyser and of the magnetic field by the Radio and Plasma Waves instrument to study an unstable solar wind electron configuration. Through a Hermite–Laguerre expansion of the VDF, we implement a low-pass filter in velocity space to remove velocity space noise and obtain a VDF suitable for analysis. With our method, we directly measure the instability growth rate and the rate of change of the electron heat flux through wave–particle interactions.

总结: 
本文使用数值磁流体动力学（MHD）模拟和TIGRESS模拟星系盘，研究了宇宙射线（CRs）与多相星际介质（ISM）之间的动态相互作用。研究发现CRs在多相ISM气体中的传输存在三种不同的情况，并且“活跃MHD”模拟预测CR压力分布更加平滑。CR压力在中平面附近与其他气体压力组分相当，但CR的尺度高度要大得多。除此之外，研究还发现CRs对于快速热流出流几乎没有影响，但对于大部分温暖/温热气体的外平面材料都能高效加速。总的来说，本研究有助于理解CRs在驱动星系流出流中的作用。 <br /><br /> <div>
We investigate the dynamical interaction between cosmic rays (CRs) and the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) using numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with a two-moment CR solver and TIGRESS simulations of star-forming galactic disks. We previously studied the transport of CRs within TIGRESS outputs using a “postprocessing” approach, and we now assess the effects of the MHD backreaction to CR pressure. We confirm our previous conclusion that there are three quite different regimes of CR transport in multiphase ISM gas, while also finding that simulations with “live MHD” predict a smoother CR pressure distribution. The CR pressure near the midplane is comparable to other pressure components in the gas, but the scale height of CRs is far larger. Next, with a goal of understanding the role of CRs in driving galactic outflows, we conduct a set of controlled simulations of the extraplanar region above z = 500 pc, with imposed boundary conditions flowing from the midplane into this region. We explore a range of thermal and kinematic properties for the injected thermal gas, encompassing both hot, fast-moving outflows, and cooler, slower-moving outflows. The boundary conditions for CR energy density and flux are scaled from the supernova rate in the underlying TIGRESS model. Our simulations reveal that CRs efficiently accelerate extraplanar material if the latter is mostly warm/warm-hot gas, in which CRs stream at the Alfvén speed, and the effective sound speed increases as density decreases. In contrast, CRs have very little effect on fast, hot outflows where the Alfvén speed is small, even when the injected CR momentum flux exceeds the injected MHD momentum flux.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了一种基于VLASS图像形态学的算法来对射电源进行类别划分，识别它们是否为类星体。研究表明，在三个已有的目录中，有超过12%的候选对象不太可能是类星体，而其中3%的Roma-BzCAT确认的类星体在VLASS形态学上被划分错误。对所有资源及其射电形态分类的结果表可在网上查阅。 <div>
Blazars are radio-loud active galactic nuclei whose jets have a very small angle to our line of sight. Observationally, the radio emissions are mostly compact or compact-core with a one-sided jet. With 2.″5 resolution at 3 GHz, the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) enables us to resolve the structure of some blazar candidates in the sky north of decl. −40°. We introduce an algorithm to classify radio sources as either blazar-like or non-blazar-like based on their morphology in the VLASS images. We apply our algorithm to three existing catalogs, including one of the known blazars (Roma-BzCAT) and two blazar candidates identified by Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer colors and radio emission (WIBRaLS, KDEBLLACS). We show that in all three catalogs, there are objects with morphologies inconsistent with being blazars. Considering all the catalogs, more than 12% of the candidates are unlikely to be blazars, based on this analysis. Notably, we show that 3% of the Roma-BzCAT confirmed blazars could be a misclassification based on their VLASS morphology. The resulting table with all sources and their radio morphological classification is available online.

<div> 高能粒子，太阳耀斑，模拟，波动，加热<br />
总结:<br />
研究使用粒子在细胞模拟中产生的高能质子和α粒子引发的波浪。初始分布函数包括两个群体：一个由各向异性（T∥ > T⊥）的一侧kappa函数表示的高能流动群体和一个冷的Maxwellian背景群体。这些分布的非等向性和非零热流不稳定化了在质子回旋频率以下的一系列频率的斜波。这些波将粒子散射到在波浪框架中的恒定能量面上的初始分布的尾部。非线性谐振宽度的重叠使得粒子在模拟结束时散射成近各向同性的分布。使用测试粒子探索了3He的动态。它们的温度可以增加近20倍。这样的波动传播到耀斑地点上下的区域可能会导致3He的加热和转运到耀斑加速区域。加热的3He会被传送到耀斑地点的数量与波能成比例。使用我们模拟的值，我们表明加热的3He将驱动到加速区域的丰度应接近太阳冕中的4He。因此，耀斑产生的高能离子所产生的波是驱动在突发性耀斑中观测到的3He增强的一个强有力的候选者。 <div>
The waves generated by high-energy proton and alpha particles streaming from solar flares into regions of colder plasma are explored using particle-in-cell simulations. Initial distribution functions for the protons and alphas consist of two populations: an energetic, streaming population represented by an anisotropic (T∥ > T⊥), one-sided kappa function and a cold, Maxwellian background population. The anisotropies and nonzero heat fluxes of these distributions destabilize oblique waves with a range of frequencies below the proton cyclotron frequency. These waves scatter particles out of the tails of the initial distributions along constant-energy surfaces in the wave frame. Overlap of the nonlinear resonance widths allows particles to scatter into near-isotropic distributions by the end of the simulations. The dynamics of 3He are explored using test particles. Their temperatures can increase by a factor of nearly 20. Propagation of such waves into regions above and below the flare site can lead to heating and transport of 3He into the flare acceleration region. The amount of heated 3He that will be driven into the flare site is proportional to the wave energy. Using values from our simulations, we show that the abundance of 3He driven into the acceleration region should approach that of 4He in the corona. Therefore, waves driven by energetic ions produced in flares are a strong candidate to drive the enhancements of 3He observed in impulsive flares.

We report the first high-resolution, detailed abundances of 21 elements for giants in the Galactic bulge/bar within 1° of the Galactic plane, where high extinction has rendered such studies challenging. Our high-signal-to-noise-ratio and high-resolution, near-infrared spectra of seven M giants in the inner bulge, located at (l, b) = (0°, +1°), are observed using the IGRINS spectrograph. We report the first multichemical study of the inner Galactic bulge by investigating, relative to a robust new solar neighborhood sample, the abundance trends of 21 elements, including the relatively difficult to study heavy elements. The elements studied are: F, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Na, Al, K, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Ce, Nd, and Yb. We investigate bulge membership of all seven stars using distances and orbital simulations, and we find that the most metal-poor star may be a halo interloper. Our investigation also shows that the inner bulge as close as 1° north of the Galactic Center displays a similarity to the inner disk sequence, following the high-[α/Fe] envelope of the solar vicinity metal-rich population, though no firm conclusions for a different enrichment history are evident from this sample. We find a small fraction of metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] > −0.5), but most of our stars are mainly of supersolar metallicity. Fluorine is found to be enhanced at high metallicity compared to the solar neighborhood, but confirmation with a larger sample is required. We will apply this approach to explore the populations of the nuclear stellar disk and the nuclear star cluster.

<div> 星系，金属丰度，星形成历史，气体动力学，辐射梯度
总结:<br /><br />这项研究探索了238个星形成星系在0.6 < z < 2.6红移范围内的气体金属丰度梯度与多种星系性质之间的关系。研究发现金属丰度梯度与大多数星系性质几乎没有相关性，包括质量加权年龄、最近星形成率、尘埃衰减和形态学。然而，金属丰度梯度与“演化时间”之间存在显著但适度的相关性，演化较为成熟的星系展现出较平缓的梯度。此外，有证据表明，具有多次星形成事件的星系倾向于形成更负的气体金属丰度梯度。研究总结认为，气体动力学，例如径向流入和流出，可能是设定气体金属丰度梯度的重要过程，除了星形成历史的演变。由于梯度在很大程度上独立于星系的物理性质，并且仅在一定程度上取决于它们的星形成历史，这说明了气体动力学的时间尺度明显短于星形成的演化过程。 <div>
We explore the relationships between the [O/H] gas-phase metallicity radial gradients and multiple galaxy properties for 238 star-forming galaxies at 0.6 < z < 2.6 selected from the CANDELS Lyα Emission at Reionization survey with stellar mass . The gradients cover the range from −0.11 to 0.22 dex kpc−1, with the median value close to 0. We reconstruct the nonparametric star formation histories (SFHs) of the galaxies with spectral energy distribution modeling using Prospector with more than 40 photometric bands from the Hubble Space Telescope, Spitzer, and ground-based facilities. In general, we find weak or no correlations between the metallicity gradients and most galaxy properties, including the mass-weighted age, recent star formation rate, dust attenuation, and morphology as quantified by both parametric and nonparametric diagnostics. We find a significant but moderate correlation between the gradients and the “evolutionary time,” a temporal metric that characterizes the evolutionary status of a galaxy, with flatter gradients observed in more evolved galaxies. Also, there is evidence that galaxies with multiple star formation episodes in their SFHs tend to develop more negative gas-phase metallicity gradients (higher [O/H] at the center). We conclude that gas kinematics, e.g., radial inflows and outflows, is likely an important process in setting the gas-phase metallicity gradients, in addition to the evolution of the SFH radial profile. Since the gradients are largely independent of the galaxies’ physical properties and only weakly dependent on their SFH, it would appear that the timescale of the gas kinematics is significantly shorter than the evolution of star formation.

We identify a molecular bubble, and study the star formation and its feedback in the S Mon region, using multiple molecular lines, young stellar objects (YSOs), and infrared data. We revisit the distance to S Mon, ∼722 ± 9 pc, using Gaia Data Release 3 parallaxes of the associated Class II YSOs. The bubble may be mainly driven by a massive binary system (namely 15 Mon), the primary of which is an O7V-type star. An outflow is detected in the shell of the bubble, suggesting ongoing star formation activities in the vicinity of the bubble. The total wind energy of the massive binary star is 3 orders of magnitude higher than the sum of the observed turbulent energy in the molecular gas and the kinetic energy of the bubble, indicating that stellar winds help to maintain the turbulence in the S Mon region and drive the bubble. We conclude that the stellar winds of massive stars have an impact on their surrounding environment.

For the first time the evolution of the coronal reconfiguration after a coronal mass ejection (CME) was observed by the multichannel Metis Coronagraph on board the ESA–Solar Orbiter mission. The images acquired in visible light (VL) between 3.0 and 5.4 R⊙ show the formation after a CME of a bright elongated radial feature interpreted as a post-CME current sheet (CS). The unique combination of VL and UV images allowed the time evolution of multiple plasma physical parameters inside and outside the CS region to be mapped in 2D for the first time. The CS electron temperature reached peak values higher than 1 MK, more than twice as high as the surrounding corona. An elongated vertical diffusion region, characterized as a region of much higher thermal pressure and lower magnetic pressure, is observed to slowly propagate outward during 13 hr of observations. Inside this region the Alfvénic Mach number is of the order of MA ≃ 0.02–0.11, the plasma β is close to unity, and the level of turbulence is higher than in the surrounding corona, but decreases slowly with time. All these results provide one of the most complete pictures of these features, and support the idea of a magnetic reconnection coupled with turbulence, thus allowing significant heating of the local plasma, despite the weakness of involved coronal magnetic fields in the considered altitude range.

<title>How Population III Supernovae Determined the Properties of the First Galaxies</title>

Massive Population III stars can die as energetic supernovae that enrich the early Universe with metals and determine the properties of the first galaxies. With masses of about 109M⊙ at z ≳ 10, these galaxies are believed to be the ancestors of the Milky Way. This paper investigates the impact of Population III supernova remnants (SNRs) from both Salpeter-like and top-heavy initial mass functions (IMFs) on the formation of first galaxies with high-resolution radiation-hydrodynamical simulations with the ENZO code. Our findings indicate that SNRs from a top-heavy Population III IMF produce more metals, leading to more efficient gas cooling and earlier Population II star formation in the first galaxies. From a few hundred to a few thousand Population II stars can form in the central regions of these galaxies. These stars have metallicities of 10−3–10−2, Z⊙, greater than those of extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars. Their mass function follows a power-law distribution with , where M* is stellar mass, and α = 2.66–5.83 and is steeper for a top-heavy IMF. We thus find that EMP stars were not typical of most primitive galaxies.

<title>Undermassive Host Galaxies of Five z ∼ 6 Luminous Quasars Detected with JWST</title>

We measure host galaxy stellar masses for a sample of five luminous quasars at z ∼ 5–7. Using JWST/NIRCam medium-band images of nearby point-spread function reference stars, we carefully subtract the contribution from the quasar light to place upper and lower limits on the flux of each host galaxy. We find that the members of our sample of quasar host galaxies have mass upper limits of 109.7–1010.8 M⊙, significantly less than expected from their supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses and the local MBH–M* relation. We additionally obtain JWST/NIRSpec integral field unit spectra of three of our quasars to calculate black hole masses, which we find are consistent with those in the literature, and to search for the presence of bright but compact galaxies via a Balmer break, for which we do not find evidence. We discuss the potential effects of dust extinction on our measured fluxes and the impact of selection effects on high-redshift quasar samples. We conclude that the masses of the SMBHs relative to the host galaxy stellar masses have a much larger scatter than locally, large enough that these selection effects cannot be responsible. This result is reinforced by other studies. Finally, we explore the potential implications of these results on the picture of SMBH–galaxy coeval growth in the early Universe.

<title>On the Comprehensive 3D Modeling of the Radiation Environment of Proxima Centauri b: A New Constraint on Habitability?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The combined influence of stellar energetic particles and galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) on the radiation environment, and hence potential habitability, of Earth-like exoplanets is relatively unknown. The present study, for the first time, comprehensively models the transport of these particles in a physics-first manner, using a unique suite of numerical models applied to the astrosphere of Proxima Centauri. The astrospheric plasma environment is modeled magnetohydrodynamically, while particle transport is modeled using a 3D ab initio GCR modulation code, as opposed to previous 1D approaches to this problem. StEP intensities are also calculated using observed stellar event profiles for Proxima Centauri as inputs. Computed intensities are then used to calculate possible atmospheric ionization effects and dose rates. We demonstrate that the contribution of GCRs to these quantities is indeed significant, contrary to the conclusions of previous studies. Furthermore, we propose a novel potential constraint on exoplanetary habitability, namely the rotational period of the host star, based on the unique 3D modeling approach presented here.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An event-based maximum likelihood method for handling X-ray polarimetry data is extended to include the effects of background and nonuniform sampling of the possible position angle space. While nonuniform sampling in position angle space generally introduces cross terms in the uncertainties of polarization parameters that could create degeneracies, there are interesting cases that engender no bias or parameter covariance. When including background in Poisson-based likelihood formulation, the formula for the minimum detectable polarization has nearly the same form as for the case of Gaussian statistics derived by Elsner et al. in the limiting case of an unpolarized signal. A polarized background is also considered, which demonstrably increases uncertainties in source polarization measurements. In addition, a Kolmogorov-style test of the event position angle distribution is proposed that can provide an unbinned test of models where the polarization angle in Stokes space depends on event characteristics such as time or energy.

Recent research reveals that the Local Group is in motion toward (l, b) = (276, 30) relative to the cosmic background radiation, manifesting a velocity of 600 km s−1, a phenomenon recognized as the cosmic background radiation dipole or cosmic microwave background dipole. Despite its well-documented nature, the precise cause of this peculiar motion remains elusive. High mass–density regions, such as galactic superclusters, stand out among the potential contributors to this cosmic flow. This paper employs chameleon fields to investigate anisotropies on both small and large scales. The data utilized in this study comprise Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon catalog, totaling 1048 supernovae within the redshift range of 0.015 < z < 2.3. The analysis of the bulk flow at various redshifts has yielded noteworthy discoveries. On a smaller scale (less than 150 Mpc), the movement direction of the Local Group coincides with that of the bulk flow. On a larger scale, the bulk flow direction corresponds to the direction of the dark energy dipole. This implies that the anisotropy at the local scale originates from the same source as the anisotropy observed on a larger scale.

Hierarchical massive quadruple systems are ideal laboratories for examining the theories of star formation, dynamical evolution, and stellar evolution. The successive mergers of hierarchical quadruple systems might explain the mass gap between neutron stars and black holes. Looking for light curves of O-type binaries identified by LAMOST, we find a (2+2) quadruple system: TYC 3340-2437-1, located in the stellar bow-shock nebula (SBN). It has a probability of over 99.99% being a quadruple system derived from the surface density of the vicinity stars. Its inner orbital periods are 3.390602(89) days and 2.4378(16) days, respectively, and the total mass is about (11.47 + 5.79) + (5.2 + 2.02) = 24.48 M⊙. The line-of-sight inclinations of the inner binaries, B1 and B2, are 55.°94 and 78.°2, respectively, indicating that they are not coplanar. Based on observations spanning 34 months and the significance of the astrometric excess noise (D > 2) in Gaia Data Release 3 data, we guess that its outer orbital period might be a few years. If it were true, the quadruple system might form through the disk fragmentation mechanism with outer eccentric greater than zero. This eccentricity could be the cause of both the arc-like feature of the SBN and the noncoplanarity of the inner orbit. The outer orbital period and outer eccentric could be determined with the release of future epoch astrometric data of Gaia.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Mg ii h&amp;k emission lines (2803, 2796 Å) are a useful tool for understanding stellar chromospheres and transition regions due to their intrinsic brightness, relatively low interstellar medium (ISM) absorption interference, and abundance of archival spectra available. Similar to other optically thick chromospheric emission lines such as H i Lyα, Mg ii emissions commonly present with a self-reversed line core, the depth and shape of which vary from star to star. We explore the relationship between self-reversal and the stellar atmosphere by investigating the extent to which fundamental stellar parameters affect self-reversal. We present a search for correlations between photospheric parameters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity with the Mg ii k self-reversal depth for a group of 135 FGKM main-sequence stars with high-resolution near-ultraviolet spectra from the Hubble Space Telescope. We modeled the observed Mg ii k line profiles to correct for ISM attenuation and recover the depth of the emission line’s self-reversal in relation to the intensity of the line. We used the PHOENIX atmosphere code to homogeneously determine the stellar parameters by computing a suite of stellar atmosphere models that include a chromosphere and transition region, and using archival photometry to guide the models of each star. We quantify the sensitivity of the visible and near-infrared photometry to chromospheric and photospheric parameters. We find weak trends between Mg ii k self-reversal depth and age, rotation period, Mg ii luminosity, temperature, and mass. All stars in our sample older than ∼2 Gyr or rotating slower than ∼10 days exhibit self-reversal.

We report the discovery of eight optical counterparts of ALFALFA extragalactic objects from DECaLS, five of which are discovered for the first time. These objects were flagged as H i emission sources with no optical counterparts in SDSS before. Multiband data reveal their unusual physical properties. They are faint and blue (g − r = −0.35 ∼ 0.55), with quite low surface brightness ( ), irregular morphologies, low stellar masses ( ), low star formation rates (SFR = 0.21 ∼ 9.24 × 10−3M⊙ yr−1), and remarkably high H i-to-stellar mass ratios ( , except AGC 215415). They deviate from the scaling relations between H i and optical properties defined by the ALFALFA sample and the baryonic Tully–Fisher relation. They agree well with the main sequence of star-forming galaxies but exhibit low star-forming efficiency. Based on their physical properties and environments, we speculate that six of these objects may have originated from tidal processes, while the remaining two appear to have isolated origins. They may have had a relatively calm evolutionary history and only begun to form stars recently.

<title>Circumgalactic Environments Around Distant Quasars 3C 9 and 4C 05.84</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present results from the Quasar hosts Unveiled by high Angular Resolution Techniques survey studying the circumgalactic medium (CGM) by observing rest-frame UV emission lines Lyα, C iv, and He ii around two radio-loud quasars, 3C 9 (z = 2.02) and 4C 05.84 (z = 2.32), using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager. We detect large-scale Lyα nebulae around both quasars with projected diameters ∼100 kpc, with spatially resolved, embedded 15–30 kpc He ii and C iv nebulae around both quasars as well as kinematically distinct He ii and C iv nebulae at a physical separation of ∼15 kpc from both quasars. Observations of Hα, Hβ, and [O iii] emission using Keck MOSFIRE spectroscopically confirm that the Lyα nebulae extend to companion galaxies and that these quasars are in a protogroup/protocluster environment. We confirm that the He ii and C iv emission is kinematically and spatially coincident with the companion galaxies. We estimate the virial masses of the companion galaxies, their metallicities, and star formation rates, and investigate the sources of ionization. We measure the dynamical mass of the host dark matter halos and estimate that the dark matter halos of these systems will grow to a mass of 2 × 1014M⊙ (3C 9) and 2 × 1013M⊙ (4C 05.84) by z = 0. The combined CGM and companion galaxies observations indicate Lyα substructure can indicate the presence of companion galaxies in the CGM.

<title>A Triple Scenario for the Formation of Wide Black Hole Binaries Such as Gaia BH1</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad2356</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad2356</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recently, several noninteracting black hole–stellar binaries have been identified in Gaia data—for example, Gaia BH1, where a Sun-like star is in a moderately eccentric (e = 0.44) 185 days orbit around a black hole. This orbit is difficult to explain through binary evolution. The present-day separation suggests the progenitor system would have undergone an episode of common-envelope evolution, but a common envelope should shrink the period below the observed one. Since the majority of massive stars form in higher-multiplicity systems, a triple evolution scenario is more likely for the progenitors of BH binaries. Here we show that such systems can indeed be more easily explained via evolution in hierarchical triple systems. von Zeipel–Lidov–Kozai oscillations or instabilities can delay the onset of the common-envelope phase in the inner binary of the triple, so that the black hole progenitor and low-mass star are more widely separated when it begins, leading to the formation of wider binaries. There are also systems with similar periods but larger eccentricities, where the BH progenitor is a merger product of the inner binary in the triple. Such mergers lead to a more top-heavy black hole mass function.

<title>Nonlinear Feedback of the Electrostatic Instability on the Blazar-induced Pair Beam and GeV Cascade</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad24ea</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad24ea</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Relativistic pair beams produced in the cosmic voids by TeV gamma-rays from blazars are expected to produce a detectable GeV-scale cascade that is missing in the observations. The suppression of this secondary cascade implies either the deflection of the pair beam by intergalactic magnetic fields or, alternatively, an energy loss of the beam due to the beam-plasma instability. Here, we study how the beam-plasma instability feeds back on the beam, using a realistic two-dimensional beam distribution. We find that the instability broadens the beam opening angles significantly without any significant energy loss, thus confirming a recent feedback study on a simplified one-dimensional beam distribution. However, narrowing diffusion feedback of the beam particles with Lorentz factors less than 106 might become relevant, even though initially it is negligible. Finally, when considering the continuous creation of TeV pairs, we find that the beam distribution and the wave spectrum reach a new quasi-steady state, in which the scattering of beam particles persists and the beam opening angle may increase by a factor of hundreds. Understanding the implications on the GeV cascade emission requires accounting for inverse-Compton cooling.

<title>Helium Abundance Periods Observed by the Solar Probe Cup on Parker Solar Probe: Encounters 1–14</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad2510</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Parker Solar Probe is a mission designed to explore the properties of the solar wind closer than ever before. Detailed particle observations from the Solar Probe Cup (SPC) have primarily focused on examining the proton population in the solar wind. However, several periods throughout the Parker mission have indicated that SPC has observed a pronounced and distinctive population of fully ionized helium, He2+. Minor ions are imprinted with properties of the solar wind’s source region, as well as mechanisms active during outflow, making them sensitive markers of its origin and formation at the Sun. Through a detailed analysis of the He2+ velocity distributions functions, this work examines periods where significant and persistent He2+ peaks are observed with SPC. We compute the helium abundance and examine the stream’s bulk speed, density, temperature, magnetic field topology, and electron strahl properties to identify distinctive solar-wind features that can provide insight to their solar source. We find that nearly all periods exhibit an elevated mean helium composition (8.34%) compared to typical solar wind and a majority (∼87%) of these periods are connected to coronal mass ejections (CMEs), with the highest abundance reaching 23.1%. The helium abundance and number of events increases as the solar cycle approaches maximum, with a weak dependence on speed. Additionally, the events not associated with a CME are clustered near the heliospheric current sheet, suggesting they are connected to streamer belt outflows. However, there are currently no theoretical explanations that fully describe the range of depleted and elevated helium abundances observed.

<title>Quaia, the Gaia-unWISE Quasar Catalog: An All-sky Spectroscopic Quasar Sample</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1328</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1328</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a new, all-sky quasar catalog, Quaia, that samples the largest comoving volume of any existing spectroscopic quasar sample. The catalog draws on the 6,649,162 quasar candidates identified by the Gaia mission that have redshift estimates from the space observatory’s low-resolution blue photometer/red photometer spectra. This initial sample is highly homogeneous and complete, but has low purity, and 18% of even the bright (G < 20.0) confirmed quasars have discrepant redshift estimates (∣Δz/(1 + z)∣ > 0.2) compared to those from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). In this work, we combine the Gaia candidates with unWISE infrared data (based on the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer survey) to construct a catalog useful for cosmological and astrophysical quasar studies. We apply cuts based on proper motions and colors, reducing the number of contaminants by approximately four times. We improve the redshifts by training a k-Nearest Neighbor model on SDSS redshifts, and achieve estimates on the G < 20.0 sample with only 6% (10%) catastrophic errors with ∣Δz/(1 + z)∣ > 0.2 (0.1), a reduction of approximately three times (approximately two times) compared to the Gaia redshifts. The final catalog has 1,295,502 quasars with G < 20.5, and 755,850 candidates in an even cleaner G < 20.0 sample, with accompanying rigorous selection function models. We compare Quaia to existing quasar catalogs, showing that its large effective volume makes it a highly competitive sample for cosmological large-scale structure analyses. The catalog is publicly available at 10.5281/zenodo.10403370.

<title>Heating and Acceleration of the Solar Wind by Ion Acoustic Waves—Parker Solar Probe</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The heating of the solar wind has been shown to be correlated with certain ion acoustic waves. Here calculations of the heating are made, using the methods used previously for STEREO observations, which show that the strong damping of ion acoustic waves rapidly delivers their energy to the plasma of the solar wind. It is shown that heating by the observed waves is not only sufficient to produce the observed heating but can also provide much or all of the outward acceleration of the solar wind.

<title>The Cosmos in Its Infancy: JADES Galaxy Candidates at z > 8 in GOODS-S and GOODS-N</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a catalog of 717 candidate galaxies at z > 8 selected from 125 square arcmin of NIRCam imaging as part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). We combine the full JADES imaging data set with data from the JWST Extragalactic Medium Survey and First Reionization Epoch Spectroscopic COmplete Survey (FRESCO) along with extremely deep existing observations from Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) for a final filter set that includes 15 JWST/NIRCam filters and five HST/ACS filters. The high-redshift galaxy candidates were selected from their estimated photometric redshifts calculated using a template-fitting approach, followed by visual inspection from seven independent reviewers. We explore these candidates in detail, highlighting interesting resolved or extended sources, sources with very red long-wavelength slopes, and our highest-redshift candidates, which extend to zphot ∼ 18. Over 93% of the sources are newly identified from our deep JADES imaging, including 31 new galaxy candidates at zphot > 12. We also investigate potential contamination by stellar objects, and do not find strong evidence from spectral energy distribution fitting that these faint high-redshift galaxy candidates are low-mass stars. Using 42 sources in our sample with measured spectroscopic redshifts from NIRSpec and FRESCO, we find excellent agreement to our photometric redshift estimates, with no catastrophic outliers and an average difference of 〈Δz = zphot − zspec〉 = 0.26. These sources comprise one of the most robust samples for probing the early buildup of galaxies within the first few hundred million years of the Universe’s history.

<title>Revisiting the Helium and Hydrogen Accretion Indicators at TWA 27B: Weak Mass Flow at Near-freefall Velocity</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1ee9</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
TWA 27B (2M1207b) is the first directly imaged planetary-mass (Mp ≈ 5 MJ) companion and was observed at 0.9–5.3 μm with JWST/NIRSpec. To understand the accretion properties of TWA 27B, we search for continuum-subtracted near-infrared helium and hydrogen emission lines and measure their widths and luminosities. We detect the He i triplet at 4.3σ and all Paschen-series lines covered by NIRSpec (Paα, Paβ, Paγ, Paδ) at 4σ–5σ. The three brightest Brackett-series lines (Brα, Brβ, Brγ) as well as Pfγ and Pfδ are tentative detections at 2σ–3σ. We provide upper limits on the other hydrogen lines, including on Hα through Hubble Space Telescope archival data. Three lines can be reliably deconvolved to reveal an intrinsic width Δvintrsc = (67 ± 9) km s−1, which is 60% of the surface freefall velocity. The line luminosities seem significantly too high to be due to chromospheric activity. Converting line luminosities to an accretion rate yields when using scaling relationships for planetary masses, and with extrapolated stellar scalings. Several of these lines represent the first detections at an accretor of such low mass. The weak accretion rate implies that formation is likely over. This analysis shows that JWST can be used to measure low line-emitting mass accretion rates onto planetary-mass objects, motivates deeper searches for the mass reservoir feeding TWA 27B, and hints that other young directly imaged objects might—hitherto unbeknownst—also be accreting.

<title>Lyman Continuum Emission from Active Galactic Nuclei at 2.3 ≲ z ≲ 3.7 in the UVCANDELS Fields</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1ef0</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the results of our search for Lyman continuum (LyC)-emitting (weak) active galactic nuclei (AGN) at redshifts 2.3 ≲ z ≲ 4.9 from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) F275W observations in the Ultraviolet Imaging of the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (UVCANDELS) fields. We also include LyC emission from AGN using HST WFC3 F225W, F275W, and F336W imaging found in Early Release Science (ERS) and Hubble Deep UV Legacy Survey data. We performed exhaustive queries of the Vizier database to locate AGN with high-quality spectroscopic redshifts. In total, we found 51 AGN that met our criteria within the UVCANDELS and ERS footprints. Out of these 51, we find 12 AGN that had ≥4σ detected LyC flux in the WFC3/UVIS images. Using a wide variety of space-based plus ground-based data, ranging from X-ray to radio wavelengths, we fit the multiwavelength photometric data of each AGN to a CIGALE spectral energy distribution (SED) using AGN models and correlate various SED parameters to the LyC flux. Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests of the SED parameter distributions for the LyC-detected and nondetected AGN showed they are likely not distinct samples. However, we find that the X-ray luminosity, star formation onset age, and disk luminosity show strong correlations relative to their emitted LyC flux. We also find strong correlations of the LyC flux to several dust parameters, i.e., polar and toroidal dust emission and 6 μm luminosity, and anticorrelations with metallicity and AFUV. We simulate the LyC escape fraction (fesc) using the CIGALE and intergalactic medium transmission models for the LyC-detected AGN and find an average fesc ≃ 18%, weighted by uncertainties. We stack the LyC fluxes of subsamples of AGN according to the wavelength continuum region in which they are detected and find no significant distinctions in their LyC emission, although our submillimeter-detected F336W sample (3.15 < z < 3.71) shows the brightest stacked LyC flux. These findings indicate that LyC production and escape in AGN are more complicated than the simple assumption of thermal emission and a 100% escape fraction. Further testing of AGN models with larger samples than presented here is needed.

<title>One-dimensional General Relativistic Particle-in-cell Simulations of Stellar-mass Black Hole Magnetospheres: A Semianalytic Model of Gamma-Rays from Gaps</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In the absence of a sufficient amount of plasma injection into the black hole (BH) magnetosphere, the force-free state of the magnetosphere cannot be maintained, leading to the emergence of strong, time-dependent, longitudinal electric fields (i.e., spark gaps). Recent studies of supermassive BH magnetospheres using analytical methods and particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations propose the possibility of efficient particle acceleration and consequent gamma-ray emission in the spark gap. In this work, we perform 1D general relativistic PIC simulations to examine the gamma-ray emission from stellar-mass BH magnetospheres. We find that intermittent spark gaps emerge and particles are efficiently accelerated in a similar manner to the supermassive BH case. We build a semianalytic model of the plasma dynamics and radiative processes, which reproduces the maximum electron energies and peak gamma-ray luminosities of the simulation results. Based on this model, we show that the gamma-ray signals from stellar-mass BHs wandering through the interstellar medium could be detected by gamma-ray telescopes such as the Fermi Large Area Telescope or the Cherenkov Telescope Array.

<title>X-Ray Polarization of the Black Hole X-Ray Binary 4U 1630–47 Challenges the Standard Thin Accretion Disk Scenario</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A large energy-dependent X-ray polarization degree is detected by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) in the high-soft emission state of the black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630–47. The highly significant detection (at ≈50σ confidence level) of an unexpectedly high polarization, rising from ∼6% at 2 keV to ∼10% at 8 keV, cannot be easily reconciled with standard models of thin accretion disks. In this work, we compare the predictions of different theoretical models with the IXPE data and conclude that the observed polarization properties are compatible with a scenario in which matter accretes onto the black hole through a thin disk covered by a partially ionized atmosphere flowing away at mildly relativistic velocities.

<title>Can Supernovae Quench Star Formation in High-z Galaxies?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
JWST is providing a unique opportunity to directly study the feedback processes regulating star formation (SF) in early galaxies. The two z > 5 quiescent systems (JADES-GS-z7-01-QU and MACS0417-z5BBG) detected so far show a recent starburst after which SF is suppressed. To clarify whether such quenching is due to supernova (SN) feedback, we have developed a minimal physical model. We derive a condition on the minimum star formation rate, , lasting for a time interval Δtb, required to quench SF in a galaxy at redshift z, with gas metallicity Z, and hosted by a halo of mass Mh. We find that lower (z, Z, Mh) systems are more easily quenched. We then apply the condition to JADES-GS-z7-01-QU (z = 7.3, M⋆ = 108.6M⊙) and MACS0417-z5BBG (z = 5.2, M⋆ = 107.6M⊙) and find that SN feedback largely fails to reproduce the observed quenched SF history. Alternatively, we suggest that SF is rapidly suppressed by radiation-driven dusty outflows sustained by the high specific star formation rates (43 and 25 Gyr−1, respectively) of the two galaxies. Our model provides a simple tool to interpret the SF histories of post-starburst galaxies and unravel quenching mechanisms from incoming JWST data.

<title>Multiwavelength Sun-as-a-star Analysis of the M8.7 Flare on 2022 October 2 Using Hα and EUV Spectra Taken by SMART/SDDI and SDO/EVE</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This paper presents a multiwavelength Sun-as-a-star analysis of the M8.7 flare on 2022 October 2, which was associated with a filament eruption and the subsequent coronal mass ejection. The Sun-as-a-star analysis was performed using Hα data taken by Solar Dynamics Doppler Imager on board the Solar Magnetic Activity Research Telescope at Hida Observatory, Kyoto University, and full-disk integrated extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectra taken by the Extreme ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The Sun-as-a-star Hα spectra showed blueshifted absorption corresponding to the filament eruption. Furthermore, the EVE O v 629.7 Å spectra showed blueshifted brightening, which can also be attributed to the filament eruption. Even when the blueshifted absorption became almost invisible in the Sun-as-a-star Hα spectra, the O v blueshifted brightening up to −400 km s−1 was still clearly visible. This result indicates that even when the shifted components—which are expected to originate from stellar eruptions—become almost invisible in the spatially integrated stellar Hα spectra, the erupting materials may still be present and observable in EUV spectra. Additionally, the Sun-as-a-star Hα and O v spectra exhibited redshifted absorption and brightening, respectively, during the decay phase of the flare. These components probably originate from the post-flare loops, providing clues to the multitemperature nature of the post-flare loops in the spatially integrated observation. Our Sun-as-a-star results suggest that the combination of Hα and EUV lines allows the investigation of the multitemperature structure and temporal development of stellar active phenomena even in spatially integrated spectra.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Ultraviolet Transient Astronomy Satellite (ULTRASAT) is scheduled to be launched to geostationary orbit in 2027. It will carry a telescope with an unprecedentedly large field of view (204 deg2) and near-ultraviolet (NUV; 230–290 nm) sensitivity (22.5 mag, 5σ, at 900 s). ULTRASAT will conduct the first wide-field survey of transient and variable NUV sources and will revolutionize our ability to study the hot transient Universe. It will explore a new parameter space in energy and timescale (months-long light curves with minutes cadence), with an extragalactic volume accessible for the discovery of transient sources that is >300 times larger than that of the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) and comparable to that of the Vera Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time. ULTRASAT data will be transmitted to the ground in real time, and transient alerts will be distributed to the community in <15 minutes, enabling vigorous ground-based follow up of ULTRASAT sources. ULTRASAT will also provide an all-sky NUV image to >23.5 AB mag, over 10 times deeper than the GALEX map. Two key science goals of ULTRASAT are the study of mergers of binaries involving neutron stars, and supernovae. With a large fraction (>50%) of the sky instantaneously accessible, fast (minutes) slewing capability, and a field of view that covers the error ellipses expected from gravitational-wave (GW) detectors beyond 2026, ULTRASAT will rapidly detect the electromagnetic emission following binary neutron star/neutron star–black hole mergers identified by GW detectors, and will provide continuous NUV light curves of the events. ULTRASAT will provide early (hour) detection and continuous high-cadence (minutes) NUV light curves for hundreds of core-collapse supernovae, including for rarer supernova progenitor types.

<title>Modeling the Multiwavelength Radiation Properties in Pulsar Dissipative Magnetospheres</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We explore the multiwavelength radiation properties of the light curves and energy spectra in the dissipative magnetospheres of pulsars. The dissipative magnetospheres are simulated by the pseudo-spectral method with the combined force-free and Aristotelian electrodynamics, which can produce self-consistent accelerating electric fields mainly distributed in the equatorial current sheet outside the light cylinder. The multiwavelength light curves and spectra are computed by using the multiple emission mechanisms of both the primary particles accelerated by the accelerating electric fields in the equatorial current sheet and the secondary pairs with an assumed distribution spectrum. We then compare the predicted multiwavelength light curves and spectra with the observed data from the Crab, Vela, and Geminga pulsars. Our modeling results can systematically reproduce the observed trends of the multiwavelength light curves and the spectra for these three pulsars well.

<title>The Polarization of the Solar Ba ii D1 Line with Partial Frequency Redistribution and Its Magnetic Sensitivity</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad217e</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad217e</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the main physical mechanisms that shape the intensity and polarization of the Ba ii D1 line at 4934 Å via radiative transfer numerical experiments. We focus especially on the scattering linear polarization arising from the spectral structure of the anisotropic radiation in the wavelength interval spanned by the line’s hyperfine structure (HFS) components in the odd isotopes of barium. After verifying that the presence of the low-energy metastable levels only impacts the amplitude, but not the shape, of the D1 linear polarization, we relied on a two-term atomic model that neglects such metastable levels but includes HFS. The D1 fractional linear polarization shows a very small variation with the choice of atmospheric model, enhancing its suitability for solar magnetic field diagnostics. Tangled magnetic fields with strengths of tens of gauss reduce the linear polarization, and saturation is reached at roughly 300 G. Deterministic inclined magnetic fields produce a U/I profile and, if they have a significant longitudinal component, a V/I profile, whose modeling requires accounting for HFS and the Paschen–Back effect. Because of the overlap between HFS components, the magnetograph formula cannot be applied to infer the longitudinal magnetic field. Accurately modeling the D1 intensity and polarization requires an atomic system that includes the metastable levels and the HFS, the detailed spectral structure of the radiation field, the incomplete Paschen–Back regime for magnetic fields, and an accurate treatment of collisions.

BL Lacertae (BL Lac) objects are a subclass of blazar, distinguished by their featureless optical spectrum. The featureless spectrum presents a challenge in measuring the redshift of the BL Lacs. In this paper, we measure the redshift of BL Lacs using the photometric dropout technique. The space-based telescope Swift and the ground-based SARA telescopes are employed to provide magnitudes in the filters. We observe 60 BL Lacs and report reliable redshift upper limits for 41 of them. We discover three new high-z BL Lacs (z > 1.3) at redshifts of , , and , bringing the number of high-z BL Lacs found by this method up to 19. Discussions are made on the implications for the blazar sequence, the Fermi blazar divide, and the gamma-ray horizon based on an analysis of the 4LAC catalog and all high-z BL Lacs found with the photo-z technique.

<title>The Evolution of Inclined Binary Black Holes in the Disks of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The accretion disks that fuel active galactic nuclei (AGNs) may house numerous stars and compact objects, formed in situ or captured from nearby star clusters. Embedded neutron stars and black holes may form binaries and eventually merge, emitting gravitational waves detectable by LIGO/VIRGO. AGN disks are a particularly promising environment for the production of high-mass gravitational-wave events involving black holes in the pair-instability mass gap, and may facilitate electromagnetic counterparts to black hole binary mergers. However, many orders of magnitude separate the typical length scales of binary formation and those on which gravitational waves can drive binary inspirals, making binary mergers inside the disk uncertain. Previous hydrodynamical simulations of binaries have either been restricted to two dimensions entirely, or focused on binaries aligned with the midplane of the disk. Herein we present the first three-dimensional, high-resolution, local-shearing-box, inviscid hydrodynamical simulations of disk-embedded binaries over a range of orbital inclinations. We find that retrograde binaries can shrink up to 4 times as quickly as prograde binaries, and that all binaries not perfectly aligned (or anti-aligned) with the AGN disk are driven into alignment. An important consequence of this is that initially retrograde binaries will traverse the inclinations where von Zeipel–Lidov–Kozai oscillations can drive binary eccentricities to large values, potentially facilitating mergers. We also find that interactions with the AGN disk may excite eccentricities in retrograde binaries and cause the orbits of embedded binaries to precess.

<title>BST1047+1156: A (Failing) Ultradiffuse Tidal Dwarf in the Leo I Group</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1cef</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1cef</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We use deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging to study the resolved stellar populations in BST1047+1156, a gas-rich, ultradiffuse dwarf galaxy found in the intragroup environment of the Leo I galaxy group. While our imaging reaches approximately two magnitudes below the tip of the red giant branch at the Leo I distance of 11 Mpc, we find no evidence for an old red giant sequence that would signal an extended star formation history for the object. Instead, we clearly detect the red and blue helium-burning sequences of its stellar populations, as well as the fainter blue main sequence, all indicative of a recent burst of star formation having taken place over the past 50–250 Myr. Comparing to isochrones for young metal-poor stellar populations, we infer this post-starburst population to be moderately metal-poor, with metallicity [M/H] in the range −1 to −1.5. The combination of a young, moderately metal-poor post starburst population and no old stars motivates a scenario in which BST1047 was recently formed during a weak burst of star formation in gas that was tidally stripped from the outskirts of the neighboring massive spiral M96. BST1047's extremely diffuse nature, lack of ongoing star formation, and disturbed H i morphology all argue that it is a transitory object, a “failing tidal dwarf” in the process of being disrupted by interactions within the Leo I group. Finally, in the environment surrounding BST1047, our imaging also reveals the old, metal-poor ([M/H] = − 1.3 ± 0.2) stellar halo of M96 at a projected radius of 50 kpc.

<title>Brown Dwarf Candidates in the JADES and CEERS Extragalactic Surveys</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
By combining the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRCam JADES and CEERS extragalactic data sets, we have uncovered a sample of 21 T and Y brown dwarf candidates at best-fit distances between 0.1 and 4.2 kpc. These sources were selected by targeting the blue 1–2.5 μm colors and red 3–4.5 μm colors that arise from molecular absorption in the atmospheres of Teff < 1300 K brown dwarfs. We fit these sources using multiple models of substellar atmospheres and present the resulting fluxes, sizes, effective temperatures, and other derived properties for the sample. If confirmed, these fits place the majority of the sources in the Milky Way thick disk and halo. We observe proper motions for seven of the candidate brown dwarfs, with directions in agreement with the plane of our Galaxy, providing evidence that they are not extragalactic in nature. We demonstrate how the colors of these sources differ from selected high-redshift galaxies, and explore the selection of these sources in planned large-area JWST NIRCam surveys. Deep imaging with JWST/NIRCam presents an an excellent opportunity for finding and understanding these ultracool dwarfs at kiloparsec distances.

<title>Second Harmonic Electromagnetic Wave Emissions from a Turbulent Plasma with Random Density Fluctuations</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad20ee</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In the solar wind, electromagnetic waves at the harmonic plasma frequency 2ωp can be generated as a result of coalescence between forward- and backward-propagating Langmuir waves. A new approach to calculate their radiation efficiency in plasmas with external background density fluctuations is developed. The evolution of Langmuir wave turbulence is studied by solving numerically the Zakharov equations in a two-dimensional randomly inhomogeneous plasma. Then, the dynamics of the nonlinear electric currents modulated at frequencies close to 2ωp are calculated, as well as their radiation into harmonic electromagnetic waves. In the frame of this non-self-consistent approach where all transformations of Langmuir waves on density inhomogeneities are taken into account, the electromagnetic wave radiation rate (emissivity) is determined numerically as well as analytically, providing in both cases similar results. Moreover, scaling laws of the harmonic wave emissivity as a function of the ratio of the light velocity to the electron plasma thermal velocity are found. It is also shown how the emissivity depends on the average level of density fluctuations and on the isotropic/anisotropic character of the Langmuir waves’ and density fluctuations’ spectra.

<title>Velocity Acoustic Oscillations on Cosmic Dawn 21 cm Power Spectrum as a Probe of Small-scale Density Fluctuations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad235b</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad235b</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the feasibility of using the velocity acoustic oscillations (VAO) features on the Cosmic Dawn 21 cm power spectrum to probe small-scale density fluctuations. In the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model, Population III stars form in minihalos and affect the 21 cm signal through Lyα and X-ray radiation. Such a process is modulated by the relative motion between dark matter and baryons, generating the VAO wiggles on the 21 cm power spectrum. In the fuzzy or warm dark matter models for which the number of minihalos is reduced, the VAO wiggles are weaker or even fully invisible. We investigate the wiggle features in the CDM with different astrophysical models and in different dark matter models. We find that (1) in the CDM model the relative streaming velocities can generate the VAO wiggles for broad ranges of parameters f*, ζX, and fesc,LWζLW, though for different parameters the wiggles would appear at different redshifts and have different amplitudes. (2) For the axion model with ma ≲ 10−19 eV, the VAO wiggles are negligible. In the mixed model, the VAO signal is sensitive to the axion fraction. For example, the wiggles almost disappear when fa ≳ 10% for ma = 10−21 eV. Therefore, the VAO signal can be an effective indicator for small-scale density fluctuations and a useful probe of the nature of dark matter. The Square Kilometre Array-low with ∼2000 hr observation time has the ability to detect the VAO signal and constrain dark matter models.

<title>Correlations between Total and Spectral Solar Irradiance Variations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad24e5</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad24e5</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We compare short-term (seven solar rotations), wavelength-dependent temporal variations in spectral solar irradiance (SSI) with those from the total solar irradiance (TSI). Using space-based measurements, we empirically find good correlations across most of the visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectral range, suggesting that the TSI time variability can provide a useful estimate of SSI variability. These empirically determined correlations are consistent with physics-based bolometric variations, providing a straightforward wavelength-dependent parameterization of the SSI variability given a known change in the TSI. Using a solar-irradiance model to distinguish the facular and sunspot contributions, which are responsible for nearly all the irradiance variability on timescales longer than a day, we confirm these results and determine the correlation contributions due to each magnetic activity type individually. The correlations determined from the model agree in functional form to those of the empirical data, although we do note differences near opacity minimum (1.6 μm). Our results provide a simple TSI-based estimate of the time dependence of the spectral solar variability across the ultraviolet to NIR spectral regions, with the TSI accounting for 94% of the variability in the SSI over the 400–1200 nm range.

<title>The Gas-phase Mass–Metallicity Relation for Massive Galaxies at z ∼ 0.7 with the LEGA-C Survey</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad250c</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad250c</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The massive end of the gas-phase mass–metallicity relation (MZR) is a sensitive probe of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback that is a crucial but highly uncertain component of galaxy evolution models. In this paper, we extend the z ∼ 0.7 MZR by ∼0.5 dex up to log (M⋆/M⊙) ∼ 11.1. We use extremely deep VLT VIMOS spectra from the Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census (LEGA-C) survey to measure metallicities for 145 galaxies. The LEGA-C MZR matches the normalization of the z ∼ 0.8 DEEP2 MZR where they overlap, so we combine the two to create an MZR spanning from 9.3 to 11.1 log (M⋆/M⊙). The LEGA-C+DEEP2 MZR at z ∼ 0.7 is offset to slightly lower metallicities (0.05–0.13 dex) than the z ∼ 0 MZR, but it otherwise mirrors the established power-law rise at low/intermediate stellar masses and asymptotic flattening at high stellar masses. We compare the LEGA-C+DEEP2 MZR to the MZR from two cosmological simulations (IllustrisTNG and SIMBA), which predict qualitatively different metallicity trends for high-mass galaxies. This comparison highlights that our extended MZR provides a crucial observational constraint for galaxy evolution models in a mass regime where the MZR is very sensitive to choices about the implementation of AGN feedback.

<title>Preliminary Discussion on the Current Sheet</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad2683</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The current sheet is a characteristic structure of magnetic energy dissipation during the magnetic reconnection process. So far, the width and depth of the current sheet are still indefinite. Here we investigate 64 current sheets observed by four telescopes from 1999 to 2022, and all of them have been well identified in the previous literature. In each current sheet, three width values are obtained at the quartering points. Based on these investigated cases, we obtain 192 values, which are in a wide range from hundreds to tens of thousands of kilometers. By calculating the pixel width (PW: the ratio of the current sheet width to the pixel resolution of corresponding observed data) of these current sheets, we find that more than 80% of the PW values concentrate on 2–4 pixels, indicating that the widths of the current sheets are dependent strongly on the instrument resolutions and all the sheets have no observable three-dimensional information. To interpret this result, we suggest that there are two probabilities. One is that the width of the current sheet is smaller than the instrument resolution, and the other is that the detected current sheet is only a small segment of the real one. Furthermore, there is another possible scenario. The so-called current sheet is just an emission-enhanced region.

<title>The Case of the Missing Very High-energy Gamma-Ray Bursts: A Retrospective Study of Swift Gamma-Ray Bursts with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad26fa</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad26fa</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are particle acceleration sites that can emit photons in the very high-energy (VHE) domain through nonthermal processes. From 2004 until 2018, the current generation of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) did not detect any GRB in the VHE domain. However, from 2018 to 2020, five detections were reported. In this work, we try to solve the case of the missing VHE GBRs prior to 2018. We aim to identify GRBs that might have eluded VHE detection in past years by the H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS IACTs. To do so, we study GRBs with known redshift detected by Swift from 2004 until June 2022. We first identify all GRBs that could have been observed by these IACTs since 2004, considering observation conditions and visibility constraints. We assume a relation between the X-rays and the VHE gamma rays based on the VHE GRBs detected to date and combine this with the redshift measurements, instrument response information, and observation conditions to predict the observed VHE gamma-ray flux from the Swift X-Ray Telescope measurements. We report findings on 12 bright low-redshift GRBs that we identify as most likely to have been detected in the VHE domain by current IACTs. The rate of IACT-detectable GRBs with ideal observation conditions is <1 VHE GRB per year with the current configuration. With its lower energy threshold and higher sensitivity, this rate increases to ∼4 VHE GRBs per year with the Cherenkov Telescope Array.

<title>Testing CCC+TL Cosmology with Observed Baryon Acoustic Oscillation Features</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1bc6</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The primary purpose of this paper is to see how well a recently proposed new model fits (a) the position of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) features observed in the large-scale distribution of galaxies and (b) the angular size measured for the sound horizon due to BAO imprinted in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy. The new model is a hybrid model that combines the tired light (TL) theory with a variant of the ΛCDM model in which the cosmological constant is replaced with a covarying coupling constants’ (CCC) parameter α. This model, dubbed the CCC+TL model, can fit the Type Ia supernovae Pantheon+ data as accurately as the ΛCDM model, and also fit the angular size of cosmic dawn galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, which is in tension with the ΛCDM model. The results we obtained are 151.0 (±5.1) Mpc for the absolute BAO scale at the current epoch, and the angular size of the sound horizon θsh = 0.°60, matching Planck’s observations at the surface of the last scattering when the baryon density is set to 100% of the matter density and ∣α∣ is increased by 5.6%. It remains to be seen if the new model is consistent with the CMB power spectrum, the Big Bang nucleosynthesis of light elements, and other critical observations.

<title>Many Roads Lead to Lithium: Formation Pathways For Lithium-rich Red Giants</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1936</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Stellar models predict that lithium (Li) inside a star is destroyed during the first dredge-up phase, yet 1.2% of red giant stars are Li-rich. We aim to uncover possible origins of this population, by analyzing 1099 Li-rich giants (A(Li) ≥ 1.5) in GALAH DR3. To expose peculiar traits of Li-rich stars, we construct a reference sample of Li-normal (doppelgänger) stars with matched evolutionary state and fiducial iron-peak and alpha-process abundances ([Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe]). Comparing Li-rich and doppelgänger spectra reveals systematic differences in the Hα and Ca-triplet line profiles associated with the velocity broadening measurement. We also find twice as many Li-rich stars appear to be fast rotators (2% with vbroad ≳ 20 km s−1) compared to doppelgängers. On average, Li-rich stars have higher abundances than their doppelgängers, for a subset of elements, and Li-rich stars at the base of RGB have higher mean s-process abundances (≥0.05 dex for Ba, Y, Zr), relative to their doppelgängers. External mass-transfer from intermediate-mass AGB companions could explain this signature. Additional companion analysis excludes binaries with mass ratios ≳0.5 at ≳7 au. Finally, we confirm a prevalence of Li-rich stars on the red clump that increases with lithium, which supports an evolutionary state mechanism for Li-enhancement. Multiple culprits, including binary spin-up and mass-transfer, are therefore likely mechanisms of Li-enrichment.

<title>Using Bright Point Shapes to Constrain Wave Heating of the Solar Corona: Predictions for DKIST</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Magnetic bright points on the solar photosphere mark the footpoints of kilogauss magnetic flux tubes extending toward the corona. Convective buffeting of these tubes is believed to excite magnetohydrodynamic waves, which can propagate to the corona and deposit heat there. Measuring wave excitation via bright point motion can thus constrain coronal and heliospheric models, and this has been done extensively with centroid tracking, which can estimate kink-mode wave excitation. DKIST is the first telescope to provide well-resolved observations of bright points, allowing shape and size measurements to probe the excitation of other wave modes that have been difficult, if not impossible, to study to date. In this work, we demonstrate a method of automatic bright point tracking that robustly identifies the shapes of bright points, and we develop a technique for interpreting measured bright point shape changes as the driving of a range of thin-tube wave modes. We demonstrate these techniques on a MURaM simulation of DKIST-like resolution. These initial results suggest that modes other than the long-studied kink mode could increase the total available energy budget for wave heating by 50%. Pending observational verification as well as modeling of the propagation and dissipation of these additional wave modes, this could represent a significant increase in the potency of wave-turbulence heating models.

<title>SAGUARO: Time-domain Infrastructure for the Fourth Gravitational-wave Observing Run and Beyond</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad2170</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present upgraded infrastructure for Searches After Gravitational waves Using ARizona Observatories (SAGUARO) during LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA’s fourth gravitational-wave (GW) observing run (O4). These upgrades implement many of the lessons we learned after a comprehensive analysis of potential electromagnetic counterparts to the GWs discovered during the previous observing run. We have developed a new web-based target and observation manager (TOM) that allows us to coordinate sky surveys, vet potential counterparts, and trigger follow-up observations from one centralized portal. The TOM includes software that aggregates all publicly available information on the light curves and possible host galaxies of targets, allowing us to rule out potential contaminants like active galactic nuclei, variable stars, solar system objects, and preexisting supernovae, as well as to assess the viability of any plausible counterparts. We have also upgraded our image-subtraction pipeline by assembling deeper reference images and training a new neural-network-based real–bogus classifier. These infrastructure upgrades will aid coordination by enabling the prompt reporting of observations, discoveries, and analysis to the GW follow-up community, and put SAGUARO in an advantageous position to discover kilonovae in the remainder of O4 and beyond. Many elements of our open-source software stack have broad utility beyond multimessenger astronomy, and will be particularly relevant in the “big data” era of transient discoveries by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.

<title>An Extremely Young Protostellar Core, MMS 1/OMC-3: Episodic Mass Ejection History Traced by the Micro SiO Jet</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present ∼0.″2 (∼80 au) resolution observations of the CO(2–1) and SiO(5–4) lines made with the Atacama large millimeter/submillimeter array toward an extremely young intermediate-mass protostellar source (tdyn < 1000 yr), MMS 1 located in the Orion Molecular Cloud-3 region. We have successfully imaged a very compact CO molecular outflow associated with MMS 1, having deprojected lobe sizes of ∼1800 au (redshifted lobe) and ∼2800 au (blueshifted lobe). We have also detected an extremely compact (≲1000 au) and collimated SiO protostellar jet within the CO outflow. The maximum deprojected jet speed is measured to be as high as 93 km s−1. The SiO jet wiggles and displays a chain of knots. Our detection of the molecular outflow and jet is the first direct evidence that MMS 1 already hosts a protostar. The position–velocity diagram obtained from the SiO emission shows two distinct structures: (i) bow shocks associated with the tips of the outflow, and (ii) a collimated jet, showing the jet velocities linearly increasing with the distance from the driving source. Comparisons between the observations and numerical simulations quantitatively share similarities such as multiple-mass ejection events within the jet and Hubble-like flow associated with each mass ejection event. Finally, while there is a weak flux decline seen in the 850 μm light curve obtained with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope/SCUBA 2 toward MMS 1, no dramatic flux change events are detected. This suggests that there has not been a clear burst event within the last 8 yr.

<title>Constrain the Dark-matter Distribution of Ultra-diffuse Galaxies with Globular-cluster Mass Segregation: A Case Study with NGC5846-UDG1</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1ee3</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1ee3</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The properties of globular clusters (GCs) contain valuable information of their host galaxies and dark-matter halos. In the remarkable example of ultra-diffuse galaxy, NGC5846-UDG1, the GC population exhibits strong radial mass segregation, indicative of dynamical-friction-driven orbital decay, which opens the possibility of using imaging data alone to constrain the dark-matter content of the galaxy. To explore this possibility, we develop a semianalytical model of GC evolution, which starts from the initial mass, structural, and spatial distributions of the GC progenitors, and follows the effects of dynamical friction, tidal evolution, and two-body relaxation. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we forward-model the GCs in a UDG1-like potential to match the observed GC statistics, and to constrain the profile of the host halo and the origin of the GCs. We find that, with the assumptions of zero mass segregation when the star clusters were born, UDG1 is relatively dark-matter-poor compared to what is expected from stellar-to-halo–mass relations, and its halo concentration is lower than the cosmological average, irrespective of having a cuspy or a cored profile. Its GC population has an initial spatial distribution more extended than the smooth stellar distribution. We discuss the results in the context of scaling laws of galaxy–halo connections, and warn against naively using the GC-abundance–halo–mass relation to infer the halo mass of ultra-diffuse galaxies. Our model is generally applicable to GC-rich dwarf galaxies, and is publicly available.

<title>Millimeter-wave CO and SiO Observations toward the Broad-velocity-width Molecular Feature CO 16.134–0.553: A Smith Cloud Scenario?</title>

We report the results of the CO J = 1–0 and SiO J = 2–1 mapping observations toward the broad-velocity-width molecular feature (BVF) CO 16.134–0.553 with the Nobeyama Radio Observatory 45 m telescope. The high-quality CO map shows that the 5 pc size BVF bridges two separate velocity components at VLSR ≃ 40 km s−1 and 65 km s−1 in the position–velocity space. The kinetic power of CO 16.134–0.553 amounts to 7.8 × 102L⊙, whereas no apparent driving sources were identified. Prominent SiO emission was detected from the BVF and its root in the VLSR ≃ 40 km s−1 component. In the CO Galactic plane survey data, CO 16.134–0.553 appears to correspond to the Galactic eastern rim of a 15 pc diameter expanding CO shell. A 1° diameter H i emission void and 4° long vertical H i filament were also found above and below the CO shell, respectively. We propose that the high-velocity plunge of a dark matter subhalo with a clump of baryonic matter was responsible for the formation of the H i void, CO 16.134–0.553/CO shell, and the H i filament.

The initial–final mass relation (IFMR) plays a crucial role in understanding stellar structure and evolution by linking a star’s initial mass to the mass of the resulting white dwarf. This study explores the IFMR in the initial mass range 0.8 ≤ Mini/M⊙ ≤ 4 using full PARSEC evolutionary calculations supplemented with COLIBRI computations to complete the ejection of the envelope and obtain the final core mass. Recent works have shown that the supposed monotonicity of the IFMR is interrupted by a kink in the initial mass range Mini ≈ 1.65–2.10 M⊙, due to the interaction between recurrent dredge-up episodes and stellar winds in carbon stars evolving on the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase. To reproduce the IFMR nonmonotonic behavior we investigate the role of convective overshooting efficiency applied to the base of the convective envelope (fenv) and to the borders of the pulse-driven convective zone (fpdcz), as well as its interplay with mass loss. We compare our models to observational data and find that fenv must vary with initial mass in order to accurately reproduce the IFMR’s observed kink and slopes. We find some degeneracy between the overshooting parameters when only the IFMR information is used. Nonetheless, this analysis provides valuable insights into the internal mixing processes during the TP-AGB phase.

<title>An Outbursting Protostar: The Environment of L1251 VLA 6</title>

Young protostars that undergo episodic accretion can provide insight into the impact on their circumstellar environments while matter is accreted from the disk onto the protostar. IRAS 22343+7501 is a four-component protostar system with one of those being a fading outbursting protostar, which was obseved with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and is referred to as L1251 VLA 6. Given the rarity of young stellar objects undergoing this type of accretion, L1251 VLA 6 can elucidate the fading phase of the post-outburst process. Here, we examine structure in the disk around L1251 VLA 6 at frequencies of 10 and 33 GHz with the VLA. We model the disk structure using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). This method is then combined with a parametric ray-tracing code to generate synthetic model images of an axisymmetric disk, allowing us to characterize the radial distribution of dust in the system. The results of our MCMC fit show that the most probable values for the mass and radius are consistent with values typical of Class I objects. We find that the total mass of the disk is and investigate the conditions that could cause the accretion outburst. We conclude that the eruption is not caused by gravitational instability and consider alternative explanations and trigger mechanisms.

<title>The Origins of Gas Accreted by Supermassive Black Holes: The Importance of Recycled Gas</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the fueling mechanisms of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) by analyzing 10 zoom-in cosmological simulations of massive galaxies, with stellar masses 1011–12M⊙ and SMBH masses 108.9–9.7M⊙ at z = 0, featuring various major and minor merger events. By tracing the gas history in these simulations, we categorize the gas accreted by the central SMBHs based on its origin. Gas that belonged to a different galaxy before accretion onto the BH is labeled as (i) “external,” while smoothly accreted cosmic gas is classified as (ii) “smooth.” Gas produced within the primary halo through stellar evolution and subsequently accreted by the SMBH is classified as (iii) “recycled.” Our analysis, which includes stellar feedback, reveals that the primary fuel source for SMBHs is the recycled gas from dying stars. This recycled gas from stars in the inner region of the galaxy readily collapses toward the center, triggering starbursts and simultaneously fueling the SMBH. Galaxy mergers also play a crucial role in fueling SMBHs in massive galaxies, as SMBHs in massive halos tend to accrete a higher fraction of external gas from mergers compared to smoothly accreted gas. However, on average, it takes approximately 1.85 Gyr for external gas to enter the main galaxy and accrete onto the SMBH. Considering the presence of various other gas triggers for active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity alongside this time delay, the association between AGNs and mergers may not always be obvious.

<title>The Metallicity–Electron Temperature Relationship in H ii Regions</title>

H ii region heavy-element abundances throughout the Galactic disk provide important constraints to theories of the formation and evolution of the Milky Way. In LTE, radio recombination line (RRL) emission and free–free continuum emission are accurate extinction-free tracers of the H ii region electron temperature. Since metals act as coolants in H ii regions via the emission of collisionally excited lines, the electron temperature is a proxy for metallicity. Shaver et al. found a linear relationship between metallicity and electron temperature with little scatter. Here we use CLOUDY H ii region simulations to (1) investigate the accuracy of using RRLs to measure the electron temperature and (2) explore the metallicity–electron temperature relationship. We model 135 H ii regions with different ionizing radiation fields, densities, and metallicities. We find that electron temperatures derived under the assumption of LTE are about 20% systematically higher owing to non-LTE effects, but overall LTE is a good assumption for centimeter-wavelength RRLs. Our CLOUDY simulations are consistent with the Shaver et al. metallicity–electron temperature relationship, but there is significant scatter since earlier spectral types or higher electron densities yield higher electron temperatures. Using RRLs to derive electron temperatures assuming LTE yields errors in the predicted metallicity as large as 10%. We derive correction factors for log(O/H) + 12 in each CLOUDY simulation. For lower metallicities the correction factor depends primarily on the spectral type of the ionizing star and ranges from 0.95 to 1.10, whereas for higher metallicities the correction factor depends on the density and is between 0.97 and 1.05.

<title>Disk-induced Binary Precession: Implications for Dynamics and Multimessenger Observations of Black Hole Binaries</title>

Many studies have recently documented the orbital response of eccentric binaries accreting from thin circumbinary disks, characterizing the change in the binary semimajor axis and eccentricity. We extend these calculations to include the precession of the binary’s longitude of periapse induced by the circumbinary disk, and we characterize this precession continuously with binary eccentricity eb for equal mass components. This disk-induced apsidal precession is prograde with a weak dependence on the binary eccentricity when eb ≲ 0.4 and decreases approximately linearly for eb ≳ 0.4; yet at all eb binary precession is faster than the rates of change to the semimajor axis and eccentricity by an order of magnitude. We estimate that such precession effects are likely most important for subparsec separated binaries with masses ≲107 M⊙, like LISA precursors. We find that accreting, equal-mass LISA binaries with M < 106 M⊙ (and the most massive M ∼ 107 M⊙ binaries out to z ∼ 3) may acquire a detectable phase offset due to the disk-induced precession. Moreover, disk-induced precession can compete with general relativistic precession in a vacuum, making it important for observer-dependent electromagnetic searches for accreting massive binaries—like Doppler boost and binary self-lensing models—after potentially only a few orbital periods.

<title>GRB 220304A: Another Gamma-Ray Burst Dominated by Thermal Radiation</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad26fc</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report a recently detected long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) event by Fermi-GBM, GRB 220304A. The spectral analysis of the burst by the Band function shows that both the time-integrated and time-resolved spectra are very narrow, with low-energy spectral index 〈α〉 = −0.05 ± 0.30 and high-energy spectral index 〈β〉 = −3.53 ± 0.30. It is reminiscent of GRB 090902B, a special GRB with photosphere radiation characteristics. Then, we perform spectral analysis using the Planck function (blackbody, BB) and the multicolor BB model. It is found that the spectra within −1 ∼ 3 s is well fit by the BB model, indicating that the observation within the first 4 s is a pure thermal event. Apart from that most of the spectra can be well modeled as a multicolor BB. We conclude that GRB 220304A is a GRB dominated by thermal radiation. We also find that the spectral widths of the time-resolved spectrum of the burst gradually increase with time. Based on the Amati relation, we infer the redshift to be 0.23, the physical properties of the relativistic outflow, and find that the relationship between the bulk Lorentz factor and the isotropic luminosity Γ–Liso,52 still exists.

Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental process in space and astrophysical plasmas that converts magnetic energy to particle energy. Recently, a novel kind of reconnection, called electron-only reconnection, has been observed in Earth's magnetosheath plasma. A defining characteristic of electron-only reconnection is that electron jets are observed but ion jets are absent. This is in contrast with traditional ion-coupled reconnection, where both ions and electrons exhibit outflowing velocity jets. Findings from the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission observations and particle-in-cell simulations show clear signatures of electron heating in electron-only reconnection events, while ions are not heated or cooled in these events. This result is unlike ion-coupled reconnection, where both ions and electrons are heated to varying degrees. The ratio of electron to ion dissipation increases with the local magnetic curvature, indicating that the partition of heat into ions and electrons is dependent on the current-sheet thickness.

<title>Formation of Merging Stellar-mass Black Hole Binaries by Gravitational-wave Emission in Active Galactic Nucleus Disks</title>

Many stellar-mass black holes (sBHs) are expected to orbit supermassive black holes at galactic centers. For galaxies with active galactic nuclei, it is likely that the sBHs reside in a disk. We study the formation of sBH binaries via gravitational-wave emission in such disks. We examine analytically the dynamics of two sBHs orbiting a supermassive black hole, estimate the capture cross section, and derive the eccentricity distribution of bound binaries at different frequency bands. We find that the majority of the merging sBH binaries, assembled in this manner, can be measured as highly eccentric, detectable in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) band from their formation, with (1 − e) ≪ 1, through their circularization and up to their merger; the remaining binaries circularize to small eccentricities (e ≲ 0.3) before entering the LVK band. More eccentric mergers would be observed for sBHs with higher random velocities, closer to the supermassive black hole, or at lower observing frequency bands, as planned in future gravitational-wave detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and LISA.

<title>A Parametric Study of the SASI Comparing General Relativistic and Nonrelativistic Treatments*</title>

We present numerical results from a parameter study of the standing accretion shock instability (SASI), investigating the impact of general relativity (GR) on the dynamics. Using GR hydrodynamics with GR gravity, and nonrelativistic (NR) hydrodynamics with Newtonian gravity, in an idealized model setting, we vary the initial radius of the shock, and by varying its mass and radius in concert, the proto-neutron star compactness. We investigate four compactnesses expected in a post-bounce core-collapse supernova (CCSN). We find that GR leads to a longer SASI oscillation period, with ratios between the GR and NR cases as large as 1.29 for the highest-compactness suite. We also find that GR leads to a slower SASI growth rate, with ratios between the GR and NR cases as low as 0.47 for the highest-compactness suite. We discuss implications of our results for CCSN simulations.

<title>Search for Continuous and Transient Neutrino Emission Associated with IceCube’s Highest-energy Tracks: An 11 yr Analysis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
IceCube alert events are neutrinos with a moderate-to-high probability of having astrophysical origin. In this study, we analyze 11 yr of IceCube data and investigate 122 alert events and a selection of high-energy tracks detected between 2009 and the end of 2021. This high-energy event selection (alert events + high-energy tracks) has an average probability of ≥0.5 of being of astrophysical origin. We search for additional continuous and transient neutrino emission within the high-energy events’ error regions. We find no evidence for significant continuous neutrino emission from any of the alert event directions. The only locally significant neutrino emission is the transient emission associated with the blazar TXS 0506+056, with a local significance of 3σ, which confirms previous IceCube studies. When correcting for 122 test positions, the global p-value is 0.156 and compatible with the background hypothesis. We constrain the total continuous flux emitted from all 122 test positions at 100 TeV to be below 1.2 × 10−15 (TeV cm2 s)−1 at 90% confidence assuming an E−2 spectrum. This corresponds to 4.5% of IceCube’s astrophysical diffuse flux. Overall, we find no indication that alert events in general are linked to lower-energetic continuous or transient neutrino emission.

<title>Resolving Phase Transition Properties of Dense Matter through Tidal-excited g-mode from Inspiralling Neutron Stars</title>

The investigation of the phase state of dense matter is hindered by complications of first-principle nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics. By performing the first consistent general-relativistic calculations of tidal-excited g-mode of neutron stars with a first-order strong interaction phase transition in the high-density core, we demonstrate that the gravitational-wave signal during binary neutron star inspiral probes their innermost hadron-quark transition and provides potent constraints from present and future gravitational-wave detectors.

<title>Intermittency in the Magnetic Hump in the VLISM</title>

Voyager 1 has been moving through the very local interstellar medium (VLISM) for ∼1 solar cycle, from 122.58 au on 2012/DOY 238 (August 25) to 158.5 au on 2023.0. A magnetic hump was observed, beginning with an abrupt increase (jump) in the magnetic field strength B and proton density N by a factor of 1.35 and 1.36, respectively, in the course of ∼8 days, ending at ∼2020/DOY 147, after which it remained above the pre-jump levels for 2.6 yr, and it is still increasing. Unlike the three previous jumps, which were followed by a slow decrease in B, B in the magnetic hump continued to increase to a maximum value ∼0.56 nT at ∼2021/DOY 146.7. This paper discusses the intermittency of the magnetic field components and strength in the magnetic hump, and compares them with previous values in the VLISM. We consider the intermittency of the increments of B and its components observed on a scale of one day. The distribution function (the Tsallis distribution or q-distribution function) of the increments of hourly averages of the components of B had a Gaussian core associated with randomness in the observations, and it had two symmetric tails associated with the observed intermittency. The parameters q-dBR1, q-dBT1, and q-dBN1 increased slightly to a broad maximum with q = ∼1.4 between 2018 and 2019, and then decreased to q ∼ 1 (corresponding to no intermittency) in 2022. The Z-component of the magnetic field is within 4 ± 4 counts (0.02 nT ± 0.02 nT).

<title>UNCOVER Spectroscopy Confirms the Surprising Ubiquity of Active Galactic Nuclei in Red Sources at z > 5</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The James Webb Space Telescope is revealing a new population of dust-reddened broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) at redshifts z ≳ 5. Here we present deep NIRSpec/Prism spectroscopy from the Cycle 1 Treasury program Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) of 15 AGN candidates selected to be compact, with red continua in the rest-frame optical but with blue slopes in the UV. From NIRCam photometry alone, they could have been dominated by dusty star formation or an AGN. Here we show that the majority of the compact red sources in UNCOVER are dust-reddened AGN: 60% show definitive evidence for broad-line Hα with a FWHM > 2000 km s −1, 20% of the current data are inconclusive, and 20% are brown dwarf stars. We propose an updated photometric criterion to select red z > 5 AGN that excludes brown dwarfs and is expected to yield >80% AGN. Remarkably, among all zphot > 5 galaxies with F277W – F444W > 1 in UNCOVER at least 33% are AGN regardless of compactness, climbing to at least 80% AGN for sources with F277W – F444W > 1.6. The confirmed AGN have black hole masses of 107–109M⊙. While their UV luminosities (−16 > MUV > −20 AB mag) are low compared to UV-selected AGN at these epochs, consistent with percent-level scattered AGN light or low levels of unobscured star formation, the inferred bolometric luminosities are typical of 107–109M⊙ black holes radiating at ∼10%–40% the Eddington limit. The number densities are surprisingly high at ∼10−5 Mpc−3 mag−1, 100 times more common than the faintest UV-selected quasars, while accounting for ∼1% of the UV-selected galaxies. While their UV faintness suggests they may not contribute strongly to reionization, their ubiquity poses challenges to models of black hole growth.

<title>The Plasma β in Quiet Sun Regions: Multi-instrument View</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A joint campaign of several spaceborne and ground-based observatories, such as the GREGOR solar telescope, the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS), and the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (Hinode Observing Plan 381, 2019 October 11–22) was conducted to investigate the plasma β in quiet Sun regions. In this work, we focus on 2019 October 13, 17, and 19 to obtain the plasma β at different heights through the solar atmosphere based on multiheight observational data. We obtained temperature, density, and magnetic field estimates from the GREGOR High-resolution Fast Imager, Infrared Spectrograph, Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, and EIS and complementary data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). Using observational data and models (e.g., FALC and PFSS), we determined the plasma β in the photosphere, chromosphere, transition region, and corona. The obtained plasma β values lie inside the expected ranges through the solar atmosphere. However, at EIS and AIA coronal heights (from 1.03 to 1.20 R⊙), plasma β values appear in the limit defined by Gary; such behavior was previously reported by Rodríguez Gómez et al. Additionally, we obtained the plasma β in the solar photosphere at different optical depths from to –2.0. These values decrease with optical depth. This work provides a complete picture of plasma β in quiet Sun regions through the solar atmosphere, which is a prerequisite of a better understanding of the plasma dynamics at the base of the solar corona.

We use LCOGT observations (MJD 59434−59600) with a total exposure time of ≃50 hr and a median cadence of 0.5 day to measure the interband time delays (with respect to u) in the g, r, and i continua of a highly variable active galactic nucleus (AGN), 6dFGS gJ022550.0-060145. We also calculate the expected time delays of the X-ray reprocessing of a static Shakura–Sunyaev disk according to the source's luminosity and virial black hole mass; the two parameters are measured from the optical spectrum of our spectroscopic observation via the Lijiang 2.4 m telescope. It is found that the ratio of the measured time delays to the predicted ones is . With optical light curves (MJD 53650–59880) from our new LCOGT and archival Zwicky Transient Facility, Pan-STARRS, Catalina Sky Survey, and ATLAS observations, and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) data (MJD 55214−59055), we also measured time delays between WISE W1/W2 and the optical emission. W1 and W2 have time delays (with respect to V), days and days in the rest frame, respectively; hence, the dusty torus of 6dFGS gJ022550.0-060145 should be compact. The time delays of the W1 and W2 bands are higher than the dusty torus size–luminosity relationship of Lyu et al. By comparing the infrared and optical variability amplitude, we find that the dust-covering factors of the W1 and W2 emission regions are 0.7 and 0.6, respectively. Future broad emission-line reverberation mapping of this target and the results of this work enable us to determine the sizes of the AGN main components simultaneously.

<title>JWST-MIRI Spectroscopy of Warm Molecular Emission and Variability in the AS 209 Disk</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present MIRI Medium-resolution Spectrograph observations of the large, multi-gapped protoplanetary disk around the T Tauri star AS 209. The observations reveal hundreds of water vapor lines from 4.9–25.5 μm toward the inner ∼1 au in the disk, including the first detection of rovibrational water emission in this disk. The spectrum is dominated by hot (∼800 K) water vapor and OH gas, with only marginal detections of CO2, HCN, and a possible colder water vapor component. Using slab models with a detailed treatment of opacities and line overlap, we retrieve the column density, emitting area, and excitation temperature of water vapor and OH, and provide upper limits for the observable mass of other molecules. Compared to MIRI spectra of other T Tauri disks, the inner disk of AS 209 does not appear to be atypically depleted in CO2 nor HCN. Based on Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph observations, we further find evidence for molecular emission variability over a 10 yr baseline. Water, OH, and CO2 line luminosities have decreased by factors of 2–4 in the new MIRI epoch, yet there are minimal continuum emission variations. The origin of this variability is yet to be understood.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the outflows detected in HOPS 373SW, a protostar undergoing a modest 30% brightness increase at 850 μm. Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of shock tracers, including SiO 8–7, CH3OH 7k–6k, and 12CO 3–2 emission, reveal several outflow features around HOPS 373SW. The knots in the extremely high-velocity SiO emission reveal the wiggle of the jet, for which a simple model derives a 37° inclination angle of the jet to the plane of the sky, a jet velocity of 90 km s−1, and a period of 50 yr. The slow SiO and CH3OH emission traces U-shaped bow shocks surrounding the two CO outflows. One outflow is associated with the high-velocity jets, while the other is observed to be close to the plane of the sky. The misaligned outflows imply that previous episodic accretion events have either reoriented HOPS 373SW or that it is an unresolved protostellar binary system with misaligned outflows.

With the help of a two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation model, we investigate the long-time evolution (near , where Ωi0 is the ion gyrofrequency in the upstream) of a quasi-parallel shock. Some of the upstream ions are reflected by the shock front, and their interactions with the incident ions excite low-frequency magnetosonic waves in the upstream. Detailed analyses have shown that the dominant wave mode is caused by the resonant ion–ion beam instability, and the wavelength can reach tens of ion inertial lengths. Although these plasma waves are directed toward the upstream in the upstream plasma frame, they are brought by the incident plasma flow toward the shock front, and their amplitude is enhanced during the approaching. The interaction of the upstream plasma waves with the shock leads to the cyclic reformation of the shock front, and the reformation period is slightly larger than 10 . When crossing the shock front, these large-amplitude plasma waves are compressed and evolve into current sheets in the transition region of the shock. At last, magnetic reconnection occurs in these current sheets, accompanying the generation of magnetic islands. Simultaneously, there still exist plasma waves of another kind, with the wavelength of several ion inertial lengths in the ramp of the shock, which are excited by the nonresonant ion–ion beam instability. The current sheets in the transition region are distorted and broken into several segments when the plasma waves of this kind are transmitted into the downstream, where magnetic reconnection and the generated islands have a much smaller size. No obvious ion flow can be observed around some X-lines produced in the magnetic reconnection, and this implies that electron-only reconnection may occur.

Understanding the magnetic fields of the Sun is essential for unraveling the underlying mechanisms driving solar activity. Integrating topological data analysis techniques into these investigations can provide valuable insights into the intricate structures of magnetic fields, enhancing our comprehension of solar activity and its implications. In this study, we explore what persistent homology can offer in the analysis of solar magnetograms, with the objective of introducing a novel tool that will serve as the foundation for further studies of magnetic structures at the solar surface. By combining various filtration methods of the persistent homology analysis, we conduct an analysis of solar magnetograms that captures the broad magnetic scene, involving a mixture of positive and negative polarities. This analysis is applied to observations of both quiet-Sun and active regions, taken with the Hinode/Solar Optical Telescope and SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager, respectively. Our primary focus is on analyzing the properties of the spatial structures and features of the magnetic fields identified through these techniques. The results show that persistent diagrams can encode the spatial structural complexity of the magnetic flux of active regions by identifying the isolated, connected, and interacting features. They facilitate the classification of active regions based on their morphology and the detection and quantification of interacting structures of opposing polarities, such as δ spots. The small-scale events in the quiet Sun, such as magnetic flux cancellation and emergence, are also revealed in persistent diagrams and can be studied by observing the evolution of the plots and tracking the relevant features.

<title>The Impact of Breathing Pulses during Core Helium Burning on the Core Chemical Structure and Pulsations of Hydrogen-rich Atmosphere White Dwarfs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Breathing pulses are mixing episodes that could develop during the core helium-burning phase of low- and intermediate-mass stars. The occurrence of breathing pulses is expected to bear consequences on the formation and evolution of white dwarfs, particularly on the core chemical structure, which can be probed by asteroseismology. We aim to explore the consequences of breathing pulses on the chemical profiles and pulsational properties of variable white dwarf stars with hydrogen-rich envelopes, known as ZZ Ceti stars. We compute stellar models with masses of 1.0M⊙ and 2.5M⊙ in the zero-age main sequence and evolve them through the core helium-burning phase to the thermal pulses on the asymptotic giant branch, and finally to advanced stages of white dwarf cooling. We compare the chemical structure of the core of white dwarfs whose progenitors have experienced breathing pulses during the core helium-burning phase with the case in which breathing pulses have not occurred. We find that when breathing pulses occur, the white dwarf cores are larger and the central abundances of oxygen are higher than for the case in which the breathing pulses are suppressed, in line with previous studies. However, the occurrence of breathing pulses is not sufficient to explain the large cores and the excessive oxygen abundances that characterize recently derived asteroseismological models of pulsating white dwarfs. We find absolute differences of up to ∼30 s when we compare pulsation periods of white dwarfs coming from progenitors that have experienced breathing pulses with the case in which the progenitors have not suffered breathing pulses.

<title>The Relationships between Active Galactic Nucleus Power and Molecular Gas Mass within 500 pc of the Center of Elliptical Galaxies</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad28c0</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad28c0</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The physical quantity that directly controls the feedback of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in elliptical galaxies remains to be determined. The discovery of molecular gas around the AGNs suggests that the gas is fueling the AGNs. Therefore, we analyze Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array data for the CO line (J = 1–0, 2–1, 3–2) emission and estimate the mass of molecular gas within 500 pc of the center of 12 noncentral elliptical galaxies (NCEGs) and 10 of the brightest cluster galaxies. We find that the mass (Mmol ∼ 105–109M☉) is correlated with the jet power of their AGNs, which is represented by , although NCEGs alone do not show the correlation. We also find that Mmol is correlated with the AGN continuum luminosities at ∼1.4 GHz (L1.4) and ∼100–300 GHz (Lcon). Since Pcav reflects galactic-scale, long-term AGN activity, while the continuum luminosities reflect local (≲500 pc), short-term AGN activity, our results suggest that AGN activity depends on the amount of gas, regardless of its timescale. On the other hand, we cannot find a clear correlation between the mass of the black holes in the AGNs (MBH) and Pcav. This suggests that Mmol, rather than MBH, is the main factor controlling AGN activity. We confirm that the origin of the continuum emission from the AGNs at ∼1.4–300 GHz is mostly synchrotron radiation.

<title>Galactic Diffuse Emission from Radio to Ultra-high-energy γ-Rays in Light of Up-to-date Cosmic-Ray Measurements</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad2a4e</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Cosmic rays (CRs) travel throughout the Galaxy, leaving traces from radio to ultra-high-energy γ-rays due to interactions with the interstellar gas, radiation field, and magnetic field. Therefore, it is necessary to utilize multiwavelength investigations on the Galactic diffuse emission to shed light on the physics of CR production and propagation. In this work, we present a spatially dependent propagation scenario, taking account of a local source contribution, while making allowances for an additional CR component freshly accelerated near their sources. In this picture, after reproducing the particle measurements at the solar system, we calculated the intensity and compared the spectral energy distribution to observations from Fermi-LAT and LHAASO-KM2A in the γ-ray band, and from WMAP and Planck among other radio surveys at lower energies. Multiband data considered in conjunction, the former comparison exhibits sufficiently good consistency in favor of our model, while the latter calls for improvement in data subtraction and processing. From this standpoint, there remains potential for advanced observations at energies from milli-eVs to MeVs toward the Galactic plane, in order to evaluate our model further and more comprehensively in the future.

<title>Aperture and Resolution Effects on Ultraviolet Star-forming Properties: Insights from Local Galaxies and Implications for High-redshift Observations*</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1dde</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1dde</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present an analysis of the effects of spectral resolution and aperture scale on derived galaxy properties using far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra of local star-forming galaxies from the International Ultraviolet Explorer (R ∼ 250, field of view (FOV) ∼ 10″ × 20″) and Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope (R ∼ 15,000, FOV ∼ 2.″5). Using these spectra, we measured FUV luminosities, spectral slopes, dust attenuation, and equivalent widths. We find that galaxies with one dominant stellar cluster have FUV properties that are independent of aperture size, while galaxies with multiple bright clusters are sensitive to the total light fraction captured by the aperture. Additionally, we find significant correlations between the strength of stellar and interstellar absorption lines and metallicity, indicating metallicity-dependent line-driven stellar winds and interstellar macroscopic gas flows shape stellar and interstellar spectral lines, respectively. The observed line strength versus metallicity relation of stellar-wind lines agrees with the prediction of population synthesis models for young starbursts. In particular, measurements of the strong stellar C ivλλ1548, 1550 line provide an opportunity to determine stellar abundances as a complement to gas-phase abundances. We provide a relation between the equivalent width of the C iv line and the oxygen abundance of the galaxy. We discuss this relation in terms of the stellar-wind properties of massive stars. As the driving lines in stellar winds are mostly ionized iron species, the C iv line may eventually offer a method to probe α-element-to-iron ratios in star-forming galaxies once consistent models with nonsolar abundance ratios are available. These results have important implications for the galaxy-scale, low-resolution observations of high-redshift galaxies from JWST (R ∼ 100–3500).

<title>Vacuum Ultraviolet Single Photon Ionization and Decomposition of 2-Aminopropionitrile in Astrophysical Objects</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1522</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1522</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The molecule 2-aminopropionitrile (2-APN; H3CCH(NH2)CN) is a chiral precursor of the amino acid alanine and could play an important role in the emergence of the homochirality of life. To date, 2-APN has not yet been detected in the interstellar medium. To address the question of its absence, possibly through destruction by vacuum ultraviolet radiation in astrophysical media, we studied its photoionization and dissociative photoionization in the 9–14 eV (89–137 nm) energy range using photoelectron–photoion coincidence spectroscopy with velocity map imaging. Density functional theory calculations were performed at the PBE0/aug-cc-pVTZ level to determine structures for the various cationic fragments identified experimentally. Their appearance energies were calculated. The adiabatic ionization energy (AIE) of 2-APN is AIE = (9.85±0.01) eV and the appearance energy (AE) of the major fragment ion N≡CC(H)NH2+ is AE = (10.57±0.01) eV. Both ions, 2-APN+ and N≡CC(H)NH2+, make up more than 90% of the formed ions. N≡CC(H)NH2+, an isomer of the protonated HCN dimer, is also formed with high yield in the dissociative photoionization of aminoacetonitrile (NH2CH2CN), another α-aminonitrile observed in Sgr B2(N). Photoion yield spectra have been calibrated to absolute ionization cross sections. From these, we derive photoionization rates in several typical radiation fields relevant to different astrophysical objects. The rates show that, under almost all explored radiation fields, dissociative ionization is the dominant pathway for photoionization, leading to the loss of a methyl group (CH3) to form the planar thermodynamically stable amino cyano methylidynium ion N≡CC(H)NH2+. The observed absence of 2-APN in Sgr B2 could thus be due to dominant dissociative photoionization.

<title>ALMA-LEGUS. II. The Influence of Subgalactic Environments on Molecular Cloud Properties</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We compare the molecular cloud properties in subgalactic regions of two galaxies, barred spiral NGC 1313, which is forming many massive clusters, and flocculent spiral NGC 7793, which is forming significantly fewer massive clusters despite having a similar star formation rate to NGC 1313. We find that there are larger variations in cloud properties between different regions within each galaxy than there are between the galaxies on a global scale, especially for NGC 1313. There are higher masses, line widths, pressures, and virial parameters in the arms of NGC 1313 and the center of NGC 7793 than in the interarm and outer regions of the galaxies. The massive cluster formation of NGC 1313 may be driven by its greater variation in environment, allowing more clouds with the necessary conditions to emerge, although no one parameter seems primarily responsible for the difference in star formation. Meanwhile NGC 7793 has clouds that are as massive and have as much kinetic energy as the clouds in the arms of NGC 1313, but have densities and pressures more similar to those in the interarm regions and so are less inclined to collapse and form stars. The cloud properties in NGC 1313 and NGC 7793 suggest that spiral arms, bars, interarm regions, and flocculent spirals each represent distinct environments with regard to molecular cloud populations. We see surprisingly little difference in surface density between the regions, suggesting that the differences in surface densities frequently seen between arm and interarm regions in lower-resolution studies are indicative of the sparsity of molecular clouds, rather than differences in their true surface density.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a comparative study of the molecular gas in two galaxies from the Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS) sample: barred spiral NGC 1313 and flocculent spiral NGC 7793. These two galaxies have similar masses, metallicities, and star formation rates, but NGC 1313 is forming significantly more massive star clusters than NGC 7793, especially young massive clusters (<10 Myr, >104M⊙). Using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) CO(2–1) observations of the two galaxies with the same sensitivity and resolution (13 pc), we directly compare the molecular gas in these two similar galaxies to determine the physical conditions responsible for their large disparity in cluster formation. By fitting size–line width relations for the clouds in each galaxy, we find that NGC 1313 has a higher intercept than NGC 7793, implying that its clouds have higher kinetic energies at a given size scale. NGC 1313 also has more clouds near virial equilibrium than NGC 7793, which may be connected to its higher rate of massive cluster formation. However, these virially bound clouds do not show a stronger correlation with young clusters than with the general cloud population. We find surprisingly small differences between the distributions of molecular cloud populations in the two galaxies, though the largest of those differences is that NGC 1313 has higher surface densities and lower freefall times.

<title>Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk). XIV. Flared Dust Distribution and Viscous Accretion Heating of the Disk around R CrA IRS 7B-a</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1f57</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We performed radiative transfer calculations and observing simulations to reproduce the 1.3 mm dust-continuum and C18O (2–1) images in the Class I protostar R CrA IRS7B-a, observed with the ALMA Large Program “Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk).” We found that a dust disk model passively heated by the central protostar cannot reproduce the observed peak brightness temperature of the 1.3 mm continuum emission (∼195 K), regardless of the assumptions about the dust opacity. Our calculation suggests that viscous accretion heating in the disk is required to reproduce the observed high brightness temperature. The observed intensity profile of the 1.3 mm dust-continuum emission along the disk minor axis is skewed toward the far side of the disk. Our modeling reveals that this asymmetric intensity distribution requires flaring of the dust along the disk vertical direction with the scale height following h/r ∼ r0.3 as a function of radius. These results are in sharp contrast to those of Class II disks, which show geometrically flat dust distributions and lower dust temperatures. From our modeling of the C18O (2–1) emission, the outermost radius of the gas disk is estimated to be ∼80 au, which is larger than that of the dust disk (∼62 au), to reproduce the observed distribution of the C18O (2–1) emission in IRS 7B-a. Our modeling unveils a hot and thick dust disk plus a larger gas disk around one of the eDisk targets, which could be applicable to other protostellar sources in contrast to more evolved sources.

<title>The Influence of Stellar Rotation in Binary Systems on Core-collapse Supernova Progenitors and Multimessenger Signals</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The detailed structure of core-collapse supernova progenitors is crucial for studying supernova explosion engines and the corresponding multimessenger signals. In this paper, we investigate the influence of stellar rotation on binary systems consisting of a 30M⊙ donor star and a 20M⊙ accretor using the MESA stellar evolution code. We find that through mass transfer in binary systems, fast-rotating red- and blue-supergiant progenitors can be formed within a certain range of the initial orbital periods, although the correlation is not linear. We also find that even with the same initial mass ratio of the binary system, the resulting final masses of the collapsars, the iron core masses, the compactness parameters, and the final rotational rates can vary widely and are sensitive to the initial orbital periods. For instance, the progenitors with strong convection form a thinner Si shell and a wider O shell compared to those in single-star systems. In addition, we conduct 2D self-consistent core-collapse supernova simulations with neutrino transport for these rotating progenitors derived from binary stellar evolution. We find that the neutrino and gravitational-wave signatures of these binary progenitors could exhibit significant variations. Progenitors with larger compactness parameters produce more massive proto-neutron stars, have higher mass accretion rates, and emit brighter neutrino luminosity and louder gravitational emissions. Finally, we observe stellar-mass black hole formation in some of our failed exploding models.

<title>A New Route to Massive Hot Subdwarfs: Common Envelope Ejection from Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The hot subdwarf O/B stars (sdO/Bs) are known as extreme horizontal branch stars, which is of great importance in stellar evolution theory. The sdO/Bs are generally thought to have a helium-burning core and a thin hydrogen envelope (Menv < 0.02 M⊙). In the canonical binary evolution scenario, sdO/Bs are considered to be the stripped cores of red giants. However, such a scenario cannot explain the recently discovered sdO/B binary SMSS J1920, where the strong Ca H and K lines in the spectrum are found. It suggests that this binary likely originated from the recent ejection of the common envelope (CE). In this work, we propose a new formation channel of massive sdO/Bs, namely, sdO/Bs produced from a CE ejection process with an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star (hereafter the AGB CE channel). We constructed the evolutionary model of sdO/Bs and successfully explained most of the important observed parameters of the sdO/B star in SMSS J1920, including the evolutionary age, sdO/B mass, effective temperature, surface gravity, and surface helium abundance. The minimum sdO/B mass produced from the AGB CE channel is about 0.48 M⊙. The evolutionary tracks in the plane may explain a fraction of the observational samples with high and low . Considering the wind mass loss of sdO/Bs, the model could produce helium-rich hot subdwarfs with .

<title>Probing the Global 21 cm Background by Velocity-induced Dipole and Quadrupole Anisotropies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The motion of an observer in the rest frame of the cosmic 21 cm background induces an anisotropy in the observed background, even when the background is isotropic. The induced anisotropy includes a dipole and a quadrupole, in the order decreasing in amplitude. If observed, these multipole anisotropies can be used as additional probes of the spectral shape of the global 21 cm background for mitigating the ambiguity in the monopole spectrum probed by single-element radio telescopes such as EDGES and SARAS. This could also help with understanding the astrophysical and cosmological processes that occurred during the cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionization, and even improve the estimation of the solar velocity and the foreground spectra. Here, we study the feasibility of such observations and present science drivers for the measurement of the 21 cm dipole and quadrupole. We find that future 21 cm experiments can in principle detect the 21 cm dipole to high significance, potentially improving measurement accuracy of Earth velocity with respect to the Milky Way, galactic, and extragalactic foreground monopole spectra by an order of magnitude, as well as improving 21 cm astrophysical parameters by 2%–5%.

<title>The Dynamics of Magnetic Rossby Waves in the Quasigeostrophic Shallow Water Magnetohydrodynamic Theory</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad22db</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad22db</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The dynamics of magnetic Rossby waves are investigated by applying a quasigeostrophic shallow water magnetohydrodynamic system, which is linearized with respect to both uniform background flow and uniform magnetic field. Due to the influence of the free surface divergence, the phase speed for magnetic Rossby waves can be either a monotonically increasing or a monotonically decreasing function, and the resulting difference between the group velocity and the phase speed can be either positive or negative. This is determined by whether the corresponding Alfvén wave speed is the upper limit or not. Differently, the phase speed is always a monotonically increasing function and the difference between the group velocity and the phase speed is always positive for incompressible magnetic Rossby waves. Multiplying a factor, the wavenumber vector shares the same endpoint with the group velocity vector. The endpoint moves on a cycle that has a center at the k-axis and is tangent to the l-axis in the wavenumber space. The circle is quite similar to the Longuet-Higgins circle for Rossby waves on Earth’s atmosphere and ocean. The fundamental dynamics is the theoretical basis for deeply understanding the meridional energy transport by waves and the interaction between waves and the background states.

<title>Zone of Preferential Heating for Minor Ions in the Solar Wind</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad23ea</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad23ea</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The properties of minor ions in the solar wind are important indicators of the state of the solar corona and the heating processes it undergoes as it expands. Evidence of preferential heating of minor ions has been observed in the solar wind, and is believed to be active up to a certain radial boundary, beyond which thermalization due to Coulomb collisions predominates. Building on previous works that calculated the location of this boundary for alpha particles, this work calculates the outer radial boundary of the zone of preferential heating for selected heavy ions in the solar wind. This analysis uses ion data from the Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer and proton data from the Solar Wind Electron, Proton, and Alpha Monitor aboard the Advance Composition Explorer spanning the years from 1998 through to 2011. Observations of proton and ion temperatures, velocities, and densities, and fixed parameters derived from temperature, density, and velocity scaling laws are used in a model function to predict the radial boundary and excess temperature at the boundary via reduction of the χ2/degrees of freedom statistic. In this study, the values of the radial boundary of the preferential heating zone were quite high when compared to what was previously found for alpha particles, but a clear scaling relationship between excess temperature and ion properties was observed.

<title>Resolved Measurements of the CO-to-H2 Conversion Factor in 37 Nearby Galaxies</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad23ed</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We measure the CO-to-H2 conversion factor (αCO) in 37 galaxies at 2 kpc resolution, using the dust surface density inferred from far-infrared emission as a tracer of the gas surface density and assuming a constant dust-to-metal ratio. In total, we have ∼790 and ∼610 independent measurements of αCO for CO (2–1) and (1–0), respectively. The mean values for αCO (2–1) and αCO (1–0) are and , respectively. The CO-intensity-weighted mean is 5.69 for αCO (2–1) and 3.33 for αCO (1–0). We examine how αCO scales with several physical quantities, e.g., the star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass, and dust-mass-weighted average interstellar radiation field strength ( ). Among them, , ΣSFR, and the integrated CO intensity (WCO) have the strongest anticorrelation with spatially resolved αCO. We provide linear regression results to αCO for all quantities tested. At galaxy-integrated scales, we observe significant correlations between αCO and WCO, metallicity, , and ΣSFR. We also find that αCO in each galaxy decreases with the stellar mass surface density (Σ⋆) in high-surface-density regions (Σ⋆ ≥ 100 M⊙ pc−2), following the power-law relations and . The power-law index is insensitive to the assumed dust-to-metal ratio. We interpret the decrease in αCO with increasing Σ⋆ as a result of higher velocity dispersion compared to isolated, self-gravitating clouds due to the additional gravitational force from stellar sources, which leads to the reduction in αCO. The decrease in αCO at high Σ⋆ is important for accurately assessing molecular gas content and star formation efficiency in the centers of galaxies, which bridge “Milky Way–like” to “starburst-like” conversion factors.

The 230 GHz lightcurves of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) predicted by general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and general relativistic ray-tracing (GRRT) models by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration have higher variability MΔT compared to observations. In this series of papers, we explore the origin of such large brightness variability. In this first paper, we performed large GRRT parameter surveys that span from the optically thin to the optically thick regimes, covering the ion-to-electron temperature ratio under strongly magnetized conditions, RLow, from 1 to 60. We find that increasing RLow can lead to either an increase or a reduction in MΔT depending on the other model parameters, making it consistent with the observed variability of Sgr A* in some cases. Our analysis of GRRT image snapshots finds that the major contribution to the large MΔT for the RLow = 1 models comes from the photon ring. However, secondary contributions from the accretion flow are also visible depending on the spin parameter. Our work demonstrates the importance of the electron temperature used for modeling radiatively inefficient accretion flows and places new constraints on the ion-to-electron temperature ratio. A more in-depth analysis for understanding the dependencies of MΔT on RLow will be performed in subsequent papers.

<title>The Evolution of Photospheric Magnetic Fields at the Footpoints of Reconnected Structures in the Solar Atmosphere</title>

Magnetic reconnection is believed to play an important role in the release and conversion of energy among magnetized plasma systems. So far, we have been unable to understand under what conditions magnetic reconnection can take place. Based on observations from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), we study 16 magnetic reconnection events, and each event has a clear X-type configuration consisting of two sets of atmospheric structures. We focus on 38 footpoints that are relevant to these structures and can be clearly determined. By using SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager line-of-sight magnetograms, we track the field evolution of these footpoints. Prior to the occurrence of magnetic reconnection, the associated fields at the footpoints underwent convergence and shear motions, and thus became enhanced and complex. During the converging period, the rates of increase of the mean magnetic flux densities (MFDs) at these footpoints are 0.03–0.25 hr−1. While the unsigned mean MFDs are 70–300 G, magnetic reconnection in the solar atmosphere takes place. Subsequently, the photospheric fields of these footpoints diffuse and weaken, with rates of decrease of the MFDs from 0.03 to 0.18 hr−1. These results suggest that, due to the photospheric dynamical evolution at the footpoints, the footpoint MFDs increase from a small value to a large one, and the corresponding atmospheric magnetic fields become complicated and nonpotential; then reconnection happens and it releases the accumulated magnetic field energy. Our study supports the conjecture that magnetic reconnection releases free magnetic energy stored in the nonpotential fields.

<title>Study of Plasma Heating Processes in a Coronal Mass Ejection–driven Shock Sheath Region Observed with the Metis Coronagraph</title>

On 2021 September 28, a C1.6 class flare occurred in active region NOAA 12871, located approximately at 27°S and 51°W on the solar disk with respect to Earth’s point of view. This event was followed by a partial halo coronal mass ejection (CME) that caused the deflection of preexisting coronal streamer structures, as observed in visible-light coronagraphic images. An associated type II radio burst was also detected by both space- and ground-based instruments, indicating the presence of a coronal shock propagating into interplanetary space. By using H i Lyα (121.6 nm) observations from the Metis coronagraph on board the Solar Orbiter mission, we demonstrate for the first time the capability of UV imaging to provide, via a Doppler dimming technique, an upper limit estimate of the evolution of the 2D proton kinetic temperature in the CME-driven shock sheath as it passes through the field of view of the instrument. Our results suggest that over the 22 minutes of observations, the shock propagated with a speed decreasing from about 740 ± 110 km s−1 to 400 ± 60 km s−1. At the same time, the postshock proton temperatures peaked at latitudes around the shock nose and decreased with time from about 6.8 ± 1.01 MK to 3.1 ± 0.47 MK. The application of the Rankine–Hugoniot jump conditions demonstrates that these temperatures are higher by a factor of about 2–5 than those expected from simple adiabatic compression, implying that significant shock heating is still going on at these distances.

<title>Intermittency and Dissipative Structures Arising from Relativistic Magnetized Turbulence</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad284c</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Kinetic simulations of relativistic turbulence have significantly advanced our understanding of turbulent particle acceleration. Recent progress has highlighted the need for an updated acceleration theory that can account for particle acceleration within the plasma’s coherent structures. Here, we investigate how intermittency modeling connects statistical fluctuations in turbulence to regions of high-energy dissipation. This connection is established by employing a generalized She–Leveque model to characterize the exponents ζp for the structure functions . The fitting of the scaling exponents provides us with a measure of the codimension of the dissipative structures, for which we subsequently determine the filling fraction. We perform our analysis for a range of magnetizations σ and relative fluctuation amplitudes δB0/B0. We find that increasing values of σ and δB0/B0 allow the turbulent cascade to break sheetlike structures into smaller regions of dissipation that resemble chains of flux ropes. However, as their dissipation measure increases, the dissipative regions become less volume filling. With this work, we aim to inform future turbulent acceleration theories that incorporate particle energization from interactions with coherent structures within relativistic turbulence.

<title>Tests of Disk-locking in T Tauri Stars of the Orion Nebula Cluster</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We look for specific correlations predicted by magnetospheric accretion models for young stars that assume disk-locking using stellar and accretion parameters derived from low-resolution HST-STIS spectra of 33 T Tauri stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster. Our results provide strong support for the correlation predicted by a model that does not constrain the stellar magnetic field to a specific geometry, while little support is found for the correlation that assumes a dipolar stellar field geometry. These results support the conclusions from similar studies of older T Tauri stars in Taurus and NGC 2264 and underscore the role that trapped flux plays in regulating a young star’s angular momentum as detailed by Ostriker & Shu. While our targets were all selected to be accreting young stars based on photometric indices, approximately half of the observed stars show no significant signs of accretion in our spectra, illustrating the difficulty in using photometric indices to find accreting stars and the possible role that variability has in the appearance of spectra in young stars. Although values of accretion luminosity derived from our models agree well with those derived from Hβ luminosity for strongly accreting stars, we find that accretion luminosity derived from Hβ luminosity is not a reliable parameter for discriminating between weakly accreting and nonaccreting T Tauri stars due to chromospheric emission that is likely present in all T Tauri stars.

<title>Extending a Physics-informed Machine-learning Network for Superresolution Studies of Rayleigh–Bénard Convection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Advancing our understanding of astrophysical turbulence is bottlenecked by the limited resolution of numerical simulations that may not fully sample scales in the inertial range. Machine-learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated promise in upscaling resolution in both image analysis and numerical simulations (i.e., superresolution). Here we employ and further develop a physics-constrained convolutional neural network ML model called “MeshFreeFlowNet” (MFFN) for superresolution studies of turbulent systems. The model is trained on both the simulation images and the evaluated partial differential equations (PDEs), making it sensitive to the underlying physics of a particular fluid system. We develop a framework for 2D turbulent Rayleigh–Bénard convection generated with the Dedalus code by modifying the MFFN architecture to include the full set of simulation PDEs and the boundary conditions. Our training set includes fully developed turbulence sampling Rayleigh numbers (Ra) of Ra = 106–1010. We evaluate the success of the learned simulations by comparing the power spectra of the direct Dedalus simulation to the predicted model output and compare both ground-truth and predicted power spectral inertial range scalings to theoretical predictions. We find that the updated network performs well at all Ra studied here in recovering large-scale information, including the inertial range slopes. The superresolution prediction is overly dissipative at smaller scales than that of the inertial range in all cases, but the smaller scales are better recovered in more turbulent than laminar regimes. This is likely because more turbulent systems have a rich variety of structures at many length scales compared to laminar flows.

<title>Searches for Neutrinos in the Direction of Radio-bright Blazars with the ANTARES Telescope</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Active galaxies, especially blazars, are among the most promising extragalactic candidates for high-energy neutrino sources. To date, ANTARES searches included these objects and used GeV–TeV γ-ray flux to select blazars. Here, a statistically complete blazar sample selected by their bright radio emission is used as the target for searches of origins of neutrinos collected by the ANTARES neutrino telescope over 13 yr of operation. The hypothesis of a neutrino–blazar directional correlation is tested by pair counting and a complementary likelihood-based approach. The resulting posttrial p-value is 3.0% (2.2σ in the two-sided convention). Additionally, a time-dependent analysis is performed to search for temporal clustering of neutrino candidates as a means of detecting neutrino flares in blazars. None of the investigated sources alone reaches a significant flare detection level. However, the presence of 18 sources with a pretrial significance above 3σ indicates a p = 1.4% (2.5σ in the two-sided convention) detection of a time-variable neutrino flux. An a posteriori investigation reveals an intriguing temporal coincidence of neutrino, radio, and γ-ray flares of the J0242+1101 blazar at a p = 0.5% (2.9σ in the two-sided convention) level. Altogether, the results presented here suggest a possible connection of neutrino candidates detected by the ANTARES telescope with radio-bright blazars.

<title>Orbital Stability and Secular Dynamics of the Proxima Centauri Planetary System</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The two innermost planets of the Proxima Centauri system are separated by just 0.02 au, inducing strong gravitational interactions between them. We assess this interaction by leveraging fast orbital stability indicators and find that orbital stability is very likely if the initial eccentricities of planets b and d are less than ∼0.2, but cannot confirm stability at larger values. We find that stability is not strongly affected by the true masses of the planets or by the distant planet c. However, mutual inclinations between 95° and 142° often result in unstable motion. We further explore the long-term evolution of the orbits in these stable regions of parameter space and find that circularization can take over 5 Gyr. This tidal evolution could support surface energy fluxes in excess of 1 W m−2 for over 1 Gyr, possibly affecting planet b’s habitability.

<title>Multiple Emission Lines of Hα Emitters at z ∼ 2.3 from the Broad- and Medium-band Photometry in the ZFOURGE Survey</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a multiple emission line study of ∼1300 Hα emitters (HAEs) at z ∼ 2.3 in the ZFOURGE survey. In contrast to the traditional spectroscopic method, our sample is selected based on the flux excess in the ZFOURGE Ks broadband data relative to the best-fit stellar continuum. Using the same method, we also extract the strong diagnostic emission lines for these individual HAEs: [O iii] λλ4959, 5007 and [O ii] λλ3726, 3729. Our measurements demonstrate good consistency with those obtained from spectroscopic surveys. We investigate the relationship between the equivalent widths (EWs) of these emission lines and various galaxy properties, including stellar mass, stellar age, star formation rate, specific star formation rate, and ionization state (O32). We have identified a discrepancy between HAEs at z ∼ 2.3 and typical local star-forming galaxies observed in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, suggesting the evolution of lower gas-phase metallicity (Z) and higher ionization parameters (U) with redshift. Notably, we have observed a significant number of low-mass HAEs exhibiting exceptionally high EW[O iii]. Their galaxy properties are comparable to those of extreme objects, such as extreme O3 emitters and Lyα emitters at z ≃ 2–3. Considering that these characteristics may indicate potential strong Lyman continuum leakage, higher-redshift analogs of the low-mass HAEs could be significant contributors to the cosmic reionization. Further investigations of this particular population are required to gain a clearer understanding of galaxy evolution and cosmic reionization.

<title>Pulse Jitter and Single-pulse Variability in Millisecond Pulsars</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Understanding the jitter noise resulting from single-pulse phase and shape variations is important for the detection of gravitational waves using pulsar timing arrays. We present measurements of the jitter noise and single-pulse variability of 12 millisecond pulsars that are part of the International Pulsar Timing Array sample using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope. We find that the levels of jitter noise can vary dramatically among pulsars. A moderate correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.57 between jitter noise and pulse width is detected. To mitigate jitter noise, we perform matrix template matching using all four Stokes parameters. Our results reveal a reduction in jitter noise ranging from 6.7% to 39.6%. By performing longitude-resolved fluctuation spectrum analysis, we identify periodic intensity modulations in 10 pulsars. In PSR J0030+0451, we detect single pulses with energies more than 10 times the average pulse energy, suggesting the presence of giant pulses. We also observe a periodic mode-changing phenomenon in PSR J0030+0451. We examine the achievable timing precision by selecting a subset of pulses with a specific range of peak intensity, but no significant improvement in timing precision is achievable.

<title>Asphericity of the Base of the Solar Convection Zone</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have used solar oscillation frequencies and frequency splittings obtained over solar cycles 23 and 24 to investigate whether the base of the solar convection zone shows any departure from spherical symmetry. We used the even-order splitting coefficients, a2–a8, and estimated the contributions from each one separately. The average asphericity over the two solar cycles was determined using frequencies and splittings obtained with a 9216-day time series. We find that evidence of asphericity is, at best, marginal: the a2 component is consistent with no asphericity, the a4 and a6 components yield results at a level a little greater than 1σ, while the a8 component shows a signature below 1σ. The combined results indicate that the time average of the departure from the spherically symmetric position of the base of the convection zone is ≲0.0001R⊙. We have also used helioseismic data obtained from time series of lengths of 360, 576, 1152, and 2304 days in order to examine the consistency of the results and evaluate whether there is any time variation. We find that the evidence for time variation is statistically marginal in all cases, except for the a6 component, for which tests consistently yield p-values of less than 0.05.

<title>Two-sided Loop Solar Jet Driven by the Eruption of a Small Filament in a Big Filament Channel</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Similar to the cases of anemone jets, two-sided loop solar jets can also be produced by either flux emergence from the solar interior or small-scale filament eruptions. Using high-quality data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we have analyzed a two-sided loop solar jet triggered by the eruption of a small filament. The jet occurred in a pre-existing big filament channel. The detailed processes involved in the eruption of the small filament, the interaction between the erupted filament and the big filament channel, and the launch of the two-sided loop jet are presented. The observations further revealed notable asymmetry between the two branches of the jet spire: the northeastern branch is narrow and short, while the southern branch is wide and long and accompanied by discernible untwisting motions. We explored the unique appearance of the jet by employing the method of local potential field extrapolation to calculate the coronal magnetic field configuration around the jet. The photospheric magnetic flux below the small filament underwent cancellation for approximately 7 hr before the filament eruption, and the negative flux near the southern footpoint of the filament decreased by about 56% during this interval. Therefore, we propose that the primary photospheric driver of the filament eruption and the associated two-sided loop jet in this event is flux cancellation rather than flux emergence.

<title>Discovery of Radial Spectral Hardening in the Hot Bubble of Planetary Nebula BD+30°3639 with Median Energy Imaging</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad25fa</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We apply an imaging analysis technique to study the spatial distribution of the X-ray spectral hardness across the hot bubble of planetary nebula BD+30°3639. Hot bubble emission is typically photon starved, thus limiting the methods for spatial–spectral analysis; however, this technique uses the statistics of photon energies across the nebula to identify spatial variations in the X-ray spectral hardness. Using the median energy value of the X-ray photons, we identified a rise in median energy values toward the projected edge of the nebula, which we refer to as radial spectral hardening. We explored the origin of this radial spectral hardening with an X-ray spectral analysis of distinct regions of high and low median energy values. Given the results of the X-ray spectral fits and the fact that the hot bubble is embedded within a young, dense, planetary nebula, we conclude that the radial spectral hardening is due to an increased column density at the projected nebular edge.

<title>Comparing Observed with Simulated Solar-disk-center Scattering Polarization in the Sr i 4607 Å Line</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad26f9</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Solar magnetic fields alter scattering polarization in spectral lines like Sr i at 4607 Å via the Hanle effect, making it a potential diagnostic for small-scale, mixed-polarity photospheric magnetic fields. Recently, observational evidence for scattering polarization in the Sr i 4607 Å line at the solar disk center was found. Here, we investigate the reliability of the reconstruction method that made possible this detection. To this end, we apply it to linear polarization profiles of the Sr i 4607 Å line radiation emerging at the disk center obtained from a detailed 3D radiative transfer calculation in a magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulation snapshot with a small-scale dynamo contribution. The reconstruction method systematically reduces the scattering amplitudes by up to a factor of 2, depending on the noise level. We demonstrate that the decrease can be attributed to two systematic errors: first, the physical constraint that underlies our assumptions regarding the dependence of scattering polarization on the quadrupolar moment of the radiation field; and second, the limitations of our method in accurately determining the sign of the radiation field tensor from the observed intensity image. However, by consistently applying the reconstruction process and after taking into account image-degradation effects due to the temporally variable image quality, such as imposed by seeing, the observed and synthesized polarization signals show remarkable agreement. We thus conclude that the observed scattering polarization at the solar disk center is consistent with that emerging from a MHD model of the solar photosphere with an average magnetic field of 170 G at the visible surface.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The process whereby the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) populating the centers of galaxies have been assembled remains to be established, with the relative importance of seeds provided by collapsed Population III stars, black holes formed in nuclear star clusters via repeated mergers, or direct collapses of protogalactic disks yet to be determined. In this paper we study the prospects for casting light on this issue by future measurements of gravitational waves emitted during the inspirals and mergers of pairs of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), discussing in particular the roles of prospective measurements by LISA and the proposed atom interferometers AION and AEDGE. We find that the expected number of detectable IMBH binaries is for LISA and AEDGE and for AION in low-mass seeds scenarios and goes down to for LISA and below one for AEDGE and AION in high-mass seed scenarios. This allows all of these observatories to probe the parameters of the seed model, in particular, if at least a fraction of the SMBHs arises from a low-mass seed population. We also show that the measurement accuracy of the binary parameters is, in general, best for AEDGE, which sees very precisely the merger of the binary.

Summary: 
The study provides accurate spectroscopic parameters of isopropyl alcohol, focusing on the distribution of low-lying vibrational energy levels in the far-infrared region. Highly correlated ab initio calculations were used to distinguish between the rotational parameters of the two nearly identical conformers. The computed properties can help analyze rotational-vibrational spectra in the gas phase and further detect vibrationally excited isopropyl alcohol. The distribution of 27 energy levels is grouped into three series, with differences due to the OH torsion effect, each series containing nine subcomponents from the torsion of the two methyl groups. The computations accurately reproduce available experimental data. <div>
Accurate spectroscopic parameters of isopropyl alcohol, a volatile organic compound present on Earth and in extraterrestrial atmospheres, are provided. The work pursues the study of the far-infrared region, describing the distribution of the low-lying vibrational energy levels that can be populated at very low temperatures, having effects on the detectability and identification. The potential energy surface shows 27 almost equivalent minima producing 27 subcomponents of the levels due to tunneling effects. Computations have been performed using highly correlated ab initio calculations, accurate enough to distinguish between the rotational parameters of the two quasi-identical conformers gauche and trans. A variational procedure in three dimensions depending on three interacting internal rotations, the internal rotation of the two methyl groups and the internal rotation of the hydroxyl group, is employed to compute the energies. The 27 subcomponents of the ground vibrational state can be grouped into three series of nine energy levels located around 0.000, 1.693, and 81.927 cm−1 whose energy difference is due to the OH torsion effect. The nine subcomponents integrated in each series derive from the torsion of the two methyl groups. The computations reproduce accurately the available experimental data. New predicted properties can help the spectroscopic analysis of the rotational-vibrational spectra in the gas phase and further detections of vibrationally excited isopropyl alcohol.

康复治疗在运动损伤的预防和康复中起着重要作用。牛顿第一定律指出，物体在静止状态会保持静止，而在运动状态会保持匀速直线运动，这与运动康复中的恢复过程有一定关联。通过运动康复，可以帮助运动员转变静止状态的伤病到活跃状态的康复。促进运动员的运动能力恢复并且减少再次受伤的风险，从而实现伤病的预防和康复。因此，康复治疗在运动损伤中的重要性不容忽视。总结:<br /><br />康复治疗在运动损伤中发挥着重要作用，有助于预防伤病和促进康复。牛顿第一定律也提醒我们，静止状态下的伤病需要通过运动康复得以改变，从而实现运动员的恢复和再次受伤风险的降低。 <div>

这篇文章使用ALMA对Perseus分子云中12个原恒星多重系统的星盘定向进行了高分辨率的统计表征。他们发现紧凑源（<100 au）和广泛伴星（>500 au）的分布是不同的。紧凑源呈现出更多的偏好对齐，而广泛的伴星则可能呈现出40%到80%的偏好对齐。整体样本表明在10,000 au范围内的偏好对齐源不会超过80%，排除了完全随机对齐分布。这些结果揭示了紧凑源和广泛伴星在统计上存在差异。 <br /><br />总结: ALMA使用高分辨率观测原恒星多重系统的星盘定向，发现紧凑源和广泛伴星的分布存在差异，紧凑源呈偏好对齐，广泛伴星可能呈40%到80%的偏好对齐，整体样本排除了完全随机的对齐分布。 <div>
We present a statistical characterization of circumstellar disk orientations toward 12 protostellar multiple systems in the Perseus molecular cloud using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at Band 6 (1.3 mm) with a resolution of ∼25 mas (∼8 au). This exquisite resolution enabled us to resolve the compact inner-disk structures surrounding the components of each multiple system and to determine the projected 3D orientation of the disks (position angle and inclination) to high precision. We performed a statistical analysis on the relative alignment of disk pairs to determine whether the disks are preferentially aligned or randomly distributed. We considered three subsamples of the observations selected by the companion separations a < 100 au, a > 500 au, and a < 10,000 au. We found for the compact (<100 au) subsample, the distribution of orientation angles is best described by an underlying distribution of preferentially aligned sources (within 30°) but does not rule out distributions with 40% misaligned sources. The wide companion (>500 au) subsample appears to be consistent with a distribution of 40%–80% preferentially aligned sources. Similarly, the full sample of systems with companions (a < 10,000 au) is most consistent with a fractional ratio of at most 80% preferentially aligned sources and rules out purely randomly aligned distributions. Thus, our results imply the compact sources (<100 au) and the wide companions (>500 au) are statistically different.

总结: 月球极地发现了水冰/气体混合物喷射到太空的迁移过程，主要来自月球表面以下约10厘米深度的挥发物质升华，与撞击事件无关。这些喷射事件主要发生在冬季，与流星体轨道不一致，暗示了月球极地在挥发物质迁移方面的活跃性，对于理解水对地月系统的输送具有重要意义。 <br /><br /> <div>
The presence of water condensation in the lunar polar region has been reported. However, the origin and amount of water remain unknown, and information on the migration mechanism of water is key for understanding the delivery of water to the Earth–Moon system. We herein report the first identification of the migration process observed as localized and condensed plumes of water ice/gas mixtures ejected from the lunar surface to space in the polar region based on spectral data derived by SELENE/Kaguya. We identified water and other volatile absorption in 10,200 spectra at the nonpermanent shadowed region during the nighttime when no illumination reached the lunar surface, while nearly horizontal solar light at these regions could illuminate the sky. Ray-tracing analyses suggested that the majority of the observed volatile signal did not come from the lunar surface but from the sky (space). The majority of the identified plumes were observed at or near the hydrogen distribution reported previously. Volatile materials were repeatedly identified in some locations and most of the plume events did not coincide with the major meteoroid streams. Rather, more signals were identified during the winter season in each pole. The timing, duration, location, and temperature simulations all suggest that impact events cannot be their main origin, but rather the volatile sublimation from the subsurface (∼10 cm depth). Overall, it was revealed that the lunar polar region is active in terms of volatile migration, which is significant for understanding water delivery to the Earth–Moon system.

<div> 70 μm dark IRDCs, formaldehyde emission, kinetic temperature, high-mass star formation, ALMA Survey

总结:<br /><br />该研究使用ALMA观测了12个70 μm暗IRDCs，探查了其中的高密度核心的动力学温度。研究发现H2CO主要对低速度流组分敏感，动力学温度范围为26到300 K，马赫数高达15，表明受非热运动的显著影响。此外，还在14个原行星核心中检测到了HC3N和OCS的暖线发射，需要高激发温度。这些结果表明，ASHES领域内某些嵌入核心处于进化较为先进的阶段，这在之前对70 μm暗IRDCs并不可预期。 <div>
Massive infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) are considered to host the earliest stages of high-mass star formation. In particular, 70 μm dark IRDCs are the colder and more quiescent clouds. At a scale of about 5000 au using formaldehyde (H2CO) emission, we investigate the kinetic temperature of dense cores in 12 IRDCs obtained from the pilot Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Survey of 70 μm dark High-mass clumps in Early Stages (ASHES). Compared to the 1.3 mm dust continuum and other molecular lines, such as C18O and deuterated species, we find that H2CO is mainly sensitive to low-velocity outflow components rather than to quiescent gas expected in the early phases of star formation. The kinetic temperatures of these components range from 26 to 300 K. The Mach number reaches about 15 with an average value of about 4, suggesting that the velocity distribution of gas traced by H2CO is significantly influenced by a supersonic nonthermal component. In addition, we detect warm line emission from HC3N and OCS in 14 protostellar cores, which requires high excitation temperatures (Eu/k ∼ 100 K). These results show that some of the embedded cores in the ASHES fields are in an advanced evolutionary stage, previously unexpected for 70 μm dark IRDCs.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了银河系恒星晕的演化历史，并对局部和整个恒星晕进行了比较。通过结合观测驱动的九个最大质量的破碎的矮星星系的N体模拟建立了一个复合恒星晕模型。研究发现，局部恒星晕与整个恒星晕之间的不同可能被高估或低估，并且通过轨道积分本地恒星晕推断出的整体恒星晕性质可能会出现显著偏差。此外，研究还发现大量最近被吸收和破碎的星系在局部样本中完全缺失，可能在外恒星晕等待发现。这些结果表明需要进行延伸至银河系维里半径的恒星晕星的调查。 <div>
The Milky Way’s stellar halo, which extends to >100 kpc, encodes the evolutionary history of our Galaxy. However, most studies of the halo to date have been limited to within a few kiloparsecs of the Sun. Here, we characterize differences between this local halo and the stellar halo in its entirety. We construct a composite stellar halo model by combining observationally motivated N-body simulations of the Milky Way’s nine most massive disrupted dwarf galaxies that account for almost all of the mass in the halo. We find that (i) the representation by mass of different dwarf galaxies in the local halo compared to the whole halo can be significantly overestimated (e.g., the Helmi streams) or underestimated (e.g., Cetus) and (ii) properties of the overall halo (e.g., net rotation) inferred via orbit integration of local halo stars are significantly biased because, for example, highly retrograde debris from Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus is missing from the local halo. Therefore, extrapolations from the local to the global halo should be treated with caution. From analysis of a sample of 11 Milky Way–like simulated halos, we contextualize these results and identify a population of recently accreted (≲5 Gyrs) and disrupted galaxies on high-angular-momenta orbits that are entirely missing from local samples and likely awaiting discovery in the outer halo. Our results motivate the need for surveys of halo stars extending out to the Galaxy’s virial radius.

Interplanetary (IP) shocks are believed to play a significant role in both amplifying the background level of turbulent fluctuations and in heating the bulk solar wind (SW). This study investigates the thermodynamic properties downstream of IP shocks. We examine the temperature, density, and specific entropy changes in the shocked plasma, taking into consideration the geometric aspects of IP shock propagation within the expanding SW. Specifically, in our analysis, we account for the fact that any particular temporal range of one-point measurement may correspond to vastly different physically relevant temporal and/or spatial dimensions, such as the age of the shocked plasma and/or radial distance to the place where the plasma encountered the shock. Thus, our approach resolves the contradictions in previously reported temperature and specific entropy profiles in downstream regions and suggests that downstream regions exhibit greater turbulent heating compared to the pristine SW. This may contribute to the overall heating of the SW plasma. The paper presents a phenomenological parameter to predict specific entropy profiles and demonstrates the consistency of the proposed model with observations. We discuss the implications of these results for the thermodynamics of the SW beyond 1 au.

总结:
恒星活动周期通过光度变化和Ca H&amp;K发射通量的观测来追踪，本文报道了一个半附近双星系统(TIC 16320250)，包括一个白矮星和一个活跃的M型矮星。长达二十年的多波段光学光度曲线显示出三个重复模式，暗示了M型矮星可能有大约10年的活动周期。光度曲线拟合表明这种重复变化是极点斑块的演化，特别是运动所导致的。Ca H&amp;K、Hα、紫外线和X射线的显著发射表明M型矮星是最具磁活跃性的恒星之一。文章提出，在大时间域光度测量巡天的时代，长期光度曲线建模可以成为追踪和揭示恒星活动周期的有价值工具，尤其是对于双星系统中的恒星。

Stellar activity cycles reveal continuous relaxation and induction of magnetic fields. The activity cycle is typically traced through the observation of cyclic variations in total brightness or Ca H&amp;K emission flux of stars, as well as cyclic variations in the orbital periods of binary systems. In this work, we report the identification of a semidetached binary system (TIC 16320250) consisting of a white dwarf (0.67 M⊙) and an active M dwarf (0.56 M⊙). The long-term multiband optical light curves spanning twenty years revealed three repeated patterns, suggestive of a possible activity cycle of about 10 years of the M dwarf. Light-curve fitting indicates the repeated variation is caused by the evolution, particularly the motion, of polar spots. The significant Ca H&amp;K, Hα, ultra-violet, and X-ray emissions imply that the M dwarf is one of the most magnetically active stars. We propose that in the era of large time-domain photometric sky surveys (e.g., ASAS-SN, Zwicky Transient Facility, LSST, Sitian), long-term light-curve modeling can be a valuable tool for tracing and revealing stellar activity cycle, especially for stars in binary systems.

<div> 光学和近红外数据，DG Tau的喷流观测，质量吸积和喷射的关联，运动节点群的分类，喷射速度与光度的相关性，光度变化与喷流起源点的关系。
总结:
光学和近红外数据的观测显示了DG Tau的喷流情况，质量吸积和喷射速度之间存在明显的关联，喷流速度和光度存在很强的相关性。根据观测数据对运动节点群进行了分类，发现喷流速度与DG Tau的光度呈现出一致的变化趋势。随着时间推移，喷流速度的增加伴随着光度的提高。此外，光度的变化也与喷流的起源点位置有关，表明活跃的质量吸积会影响可变的喷射速度。 <div>
We aim to clarify the link between mass accretion and ejection by analyzing DG Tau’s jet observations from optical and near-infrared data spanning 1984–2019, alongside photometric variations between 1983 and 2015. We classified 12 moving knot groups among 17 total knot groups based on their constant proper motions and comparable radial velocities. A strong correlation emerges between the deprojected flow velocities of the knots and the photometric magnitudes of DG Tau. From 1983 to 1995, as the deprojected ejection velocities surged from ∼273 ± 15 to ∼427 ± 16 km s−1, the photometric magnitudes (V) concurrently brightened from 12.3 to 11.4. Notably, when DG Tau became brighter than 12.2 in the V band, its (B − V) color shifted bluer than its intrinsic color range of K5–M0. During this period, the launching point of the jet in the protoplanetary disk moved closer to 0.06 au from the star in 1995. Following a V magnitude drop from 11.7 to 13.4 in 1998, the star may have experienced significant extinction due to a dust wall created by the disk wind during the ejection of the high-velocity knot in 1999. Since then, the magnitude became fainter than 12.2, the (B − V) and (V − R) colors became redder, and the deprojected velocities consistently remained below 200 km s−1. The launching point of the jet then moved away to ∼0.45 au by 2008. The prevailing factor influencing photometric magnitude appears to be the active mass accretion causing the variable mass ejection velocities.

JWST中红外光谱化学调查（JDISCS）旨在利用James Webb太空望远镜（JWST）上的中红外仪器（MIRI）来理解内部原行星盘的化学演化。通过观测30多个盘，研究采用自定义方法对MIRI中分辨光谱仪（MRS）进行校准，实现了其在4.9-28μm光谱范围内高于1:300的对比度。高光谱对比度使得可以精确地从中检索物理参数，搜索罕见分子物质和同位素，并约束含碳和氮物种的库存量。JDISCS还对MRS波长和分辨率进行了重要的改进。文中描述了JDISCS校准数据并且展示了通过观测太阳质量年轻恒星FZ Tau周围的盘的光谱数据质量。FZ Tau MIRI光谱由温暖的水蒸气强烈辐射组成。研究表明水和CO线辐射来自盘面并追踪大约500-1500K的气体温度范围。我们检索了观测到的CO和H2O线的参数，并表明它们与由两个温度组分表示的径向分布一致。水的丰度高达n（H2O）约为10^-4，至少填满了盘面直到1.5天文单位处的350K等温线。我们在FZ Tau周围寻找了扩展辐射，探测到了一对径向约300天文单位的大规模氢气环绕FZ Tau，并讨论了其起源。

The JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey (JDISCS) aims to understand the evolution of the chemistry of inner protoplanetary disks using the Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). With a growing sample of >30 disks, the survey implements a custom method to calibrate the MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) to contrasts of better than 1:300 across its 4.9–28 μm spectral range. This is achieved using observations of Themis family asteroids as precise empirical reference sources. The high spectral contrast enables precise retrievals of physical parameters, searches for rare molecular species and isotopologues, and constraints on the inventories of carbon- and nitrogen-bearing species. JDISCS also offers significant improvements to the MRS wavelength and resolving power calibration. We describe the JDISCS calibrated data and demonstrate their quality using observations of the disk around the solar-mass young star FZ Tau. The FZ Tau MIRI spectrum is dominated by strong emission from warm water vapor. We show that the water and CO line emission originates from the disk surface and traces a range of gas temperatures of ∼500–1500 K. We retrieve parameters for the observed CO and H2O lines and show that they are consistent with a radial distribution represented by two temperature components. A high water abundance of n(H2O) ∼ 10−4 fills the disk surface at least out to the 350 K isotherm at 1.5 au. We search the FZ Tau environs for extended emission, detecting a large (radius of ∼300 au) ring of emission from H2 gas surrounding FZ Tau, and discuss its origin.

The atmospheres of small exoplanets likely derive from a combination of geochemical outgassing and primordial gases left over from formation. Secondary atmospheres, such as those of Earth, Mars, and Venus, are sourced by outgassing. Persistent outgassing into long-lived, primordial, hydrogen–helium envelopes produces hybrid atmospheres of which there are no examples in the solar system. We construct a unified theoretical framework for calculating the outgassing chemistry of both secondary and hybrid atmospheres, where the input parameters are the surface pressure, oxidation, and sulfidation states of the mantle, as well as the primordial atmospheric hydrogen, helium, and nitrogen content. Nonideal gases (quantified by the fugacity coefficient) and nonideal mixing of gaseous components (quantified by the activity coefficient) are considered. Both secondary and hybrid atmospheres exhibit a rich diversity of chemistries, including hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. The abundance ratio of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide serves as a powerful diagnostic for the oxygen fugacity of the mantle, which may conceivably be constrained by James Webb Space Telescope spectra in the near future. Methane-dominated atmospheres are difficult to produce and require specific conditions: atmospheric surface pressures exceeding ∼10 bar, a reduced (poorly oxidized) mantle, and diminished magma temperatures (compared to modern Earth). Future work should include photochemistry in these calculations and clarify the general role of atmospheric escape. Exoplanet science should quantify the relationship between the mass and oxygen fugacity for a sample of super Earths and sub-Neptunes; such an empirical relationship already exists for solar system bodies.

<div> 关键词: 长俄显现象, 紧凑天体的合并, 爆发物与星际介质相互作用, GRB 191019A, 短周期新星

总结: 
本文讨论了最近被Swift探测到的附近长俄显现象GRB 191019A，发现其缺乏伴随的超新星现象，可能由于两个紧凑天体在活跃星系核高密度介质中发生合并而产生。根据模型计算，在这种高密度环境中，爆发物与星际介质的相互作用可能会对短周期新星的发射产生影响，尤其是在较晚的时候。另外，如果能够在未来探测到类似GRB 191019A事件的短周期新星发射，需要更少的注入物质。文章还讨论了磁星所带来的r过程动力学和自旋能贡献。由于明亮的宿主星系的影响，目前难以从观测结果中确定GRB 191019A的短周期新星发射。 <div>
The nearby long-duration GRB 191019A recently detected by Swift lacks an associated supernova and belongs to a host galaxy with little star formation activity, suggesting that the origin of this burst is the result of a merger of two compact objects with dynamical interactions in a high-density medium of an active galactic nucleus. Given the potential motivation of this event, and given that it occurs in such a high-density environment, the ejecta–circumstellar medium (CSM) interaction cannot be ignored as possibly contributing to the kilonova emission. Here, we theoretically calculate the kilonova emission by considering the contribution of the ejecta–CSM interaction in a high-density environment. We find that the contribution to the kilonova emission from the ejecta–CSM interaction will dominate at a later time, and a smaller ejecta mass will have a stronger kilonova emission from the ejecta–CSM interaction. Moreover, we try to apply it to GRB 191019A, but we find that it is difficult to identify the possible kilonova emission from the observations, due to the contribution of the bright host galaxy. On the other hand, less injected mass (less than Mej = 2 × 10−5M⊙) will be required if one can detect the kilonova emission associated with a GRB 191019A–like event in the future. The r-process-powered and spin energy contributions from the magnetar are also discussed.

We recognize the radial fundamental mode f1 = 18.3334 c d−1 and the first overtone f3 = 23.6429 c d−1 for TIC 65138566, and identify the highest peak f1 = 19.0955 c d−1 as the radial fundamental mode for TIC 139729335. For g modes, both stars display a regular period spacing of 2413 s. Through detailed seismological analysis, we deduce that these period-spacing patterns correspond to modes with ℓ = 1. Moreover, our analysis reveals that with increases in masses and metallicities, the star should display a higher degree of evolution to match a specific period spacing Π0. Conversely, the star should have a lower extent of evolution to match the radial fundamental mode. These two contradictory behaviors allow us to precisely obtain stellar physical parameters. TIC 65138566 and TIC 139729335 are determined to be two main-sequence stars that have almost the same range of masses and metallicities, with M = 1.36 ± 0.06 M⊙ and Z = 0.005 ± 0.002. The hydrogen abundance in the core of TIC 65138566 is estimated to be about 0.28, while TIC 139729335 has a slightly higher value of around 0.31. Finally, we suggest that the high-amplitude δ Scuti–γ Doradus star TIC 308396022 is a main-sequence star with M = 1.54 ± 0.08 M⊙, Z = 0.007 ± 0.001, and Xc = 0.18 ± 0.02.

Quasi-thermal noise (QTN) spectroscopy is a valuable method to deduce important parameters in space plasma, such as plasma density and temperature, especially when direct particle measurements are not available. The present study develops a new fitting method to fit the QTN spectra observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) with a comprehensive theoretical QTN spectral model. By combining the steepest descent and Levenberg–Marquardt algorithms, the new method is more flexible with initial guess values but still yields reliable solar wind electron density and temperature values. The new method is applied to derive the solar wind density and core temperature from the QTN measurements during 10 encounters of PSP. The electron density and temperature values obtained vary with the radial distance from the Sun as ne ∝ r−2.12 and Te ∝ r−0.71, both of which are consistent with existing models and previous results.

Unraveling the internal kinematics of open clusters is crucial for understanding their formation and evolution. However, there is a dearth of research on this topic, primarily due to the lack of high-quality kinematic data. Using the exquisite-precision astrometric parameters and radial velocities provided by Gaia data release 3, we investigate the internal rotation in three of the most nearby and best-studied open clusters, namely the Pleiades, Alpha Persei, and Hyades clusters. Statistical analyses of the residual motions of the member stars clearly indicate the presence of three-dimensional rotation in the three clusters. The mean rotation velocities of the Pleiades, Alpha Persei, and Hyades clusters within their tidal radii are estimated to be 0.24 ± 0.04, 0.43 ± 0.08, and 0.09 ± 0.03 km s−1, respectively. Similar to the Praesepe cluster that we have studied before, the rotation of the member stars within the tidal radii of these three open clusters can be well interpreted by Newton’s theorem. No expansion or contraction is detected in the three clusters either. Furthermore, we find that the mean rotation velocity of open clusters may be positively correlated with the cluster mass, and the rotation is likely to diminish as open clusters age.

<title>The Reliability of Accretion Disk Inclination Derived from X-Ray Spectroscopy of Active Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The inclination angle of substructures in active galaxies gives insights into physical components from scales of the vicinity of the central black hole to the entire host galaxy. We use the self-consistent reflection spectral model RELXILL to measure the inclination of the inner region of accretion disks with broadband (0.3–78 keV) X-ray observations, systematically studying the reliability of this methodology. To test the capability of the model to return statistically consistent results, we analyze multiepoch joint XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy I Zwicky 1 and the broad-line radio galaxy 3C 382, which exhibit different degrees of spectral complexity and reflection features. As expected, we find that adding more data for analysis narrows the confidence interval and that multiepoch joint observations return optimal measurements; however, even single-epoch data can be well fitted if the reflection component is sufficiently dominant. Mock spectra are used to test the capability of RELXILL to recover input parameters from typical single-epoch joint observations. We find that inclination is well recovered at 90% confidence, with improved constraints at higher reflection fraction and higher inclination. Higher iron abundance and corona temperature tighten the constraints as well, but the effect is not as significant as a higher reflection fraction. The spin, however, has little effect in reflection-based inclination measurements. We conclude that broadband reflection spectroscopy can reliably measure inner accretion disk inclination.

<title>Upper Limits on the Radio Pulses from Magnetars and a Central Compact Object with FAST</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Magnetars and central compact objects (CCOs) are subgroups of neutron stars that show a number of properties distinguished from canonical radio pulsars. We performed radio observations of three magnetars, SGR 0418+5729, 1E 2259+586, and 4U 0142+61, and a CCO, PSR J1852+0040, with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope at 1.25 GHz, aiming to search for radio pulsations in their quiescent states. During two observation epochs, no radio pulses have been detected toward any target above a significance of signal-to-noise ratio = 7 from either the direct folding or blind search. We provided the most stringent upper limit of radio flux (≲2–4 μJy) for the magnetars and the CCO. For the magnetars with long periods, the real upper limits are likely 1 order of magnitude larger due to the red noise. The deep radio observations suggest that these magnetars and the CCO are indeed radio-quiet sources or unfavorably beamed.

<title>Do Minihalos Affect Cosmic Reionization?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The role of unresolved structures (“minihalos”) in determining the consumption of ionizing photons during cosmic reionization remains an unsolved problem in modeling cosmic reionization, despite recent extensive studies with small-box high-resolution simulations by Park et al. and Chan et al., because the small-box studies are not able to fully sample all environments. In this paper these simulations are combined with large-box simulations from the “Cosmic Reionization On Computers” (CROC) project, allowing one to account for the full range of environments and to produce an estimate for the number of recombinations per hydrogen atom that are missed in large-scale simulations like CROC or Thesan. I find that recombinations in unresolved minihalos are unimportant compared to recombinations produced in large-scale cosmic structures and inside more massive, fully resolved halos. Since both the Park et al. and Chan et al. studies have severe limitations, the conclusions of this paper may need to be verified with more representative sets of small-box high-resolution simulations.

总结:
本文重新审视了类似夸克星或中子星等紧密天体物体的电球层中电子对产生的机制，着重关注了电子的蒸发和电子和正电子的加速，这在以前的文献中并未涉及。我们使用Vlasov-Maxwell方程进行了一系列数值模拟。电球层中电场强度对电子对产生速率有很大影响。尽管保利阻塞被明确考虑在内，但我们发现在低温下并没有电子对产生速率的指数抑制。电子对的光度随温度增加而增加，可能达到L± ∼ 1052 erg s−1，比以前假定的要大得多。 <div>
The mechanism of pair creation in the electrosphere of compact astrophysical objects such as quark stars or neutron stars is revisited, paying attention to evaporation of electrons and acceleration of electrons and positrons, which were previously not addressed in the literature. We perform a series of numerical simulations using the Vlasov–Maxwell equations. The rate of pair creation strongly depends on electric field strength in the electrosphere. Although Pauli blocking is explicitly taken into account, we find no exponential suppression of the pair creation rate at low temperatures. The luminosity in pairs increases with temperature and it may reach up to L± ∼ 1052 erg s−1, much larger than previously assumed.

We present the first data release of the Far-Infrared Polarimetric Large Area CMZ Exploration (FIREPLACE) survey. The survey was taken using the 214 μm band of the HAWC+ instrument with the SOFIA telescope (19.″6 resolution; 0.7 pc). In this first data release we present dust polarization observations covering a ∼0.°5 region of the Galactic center’s central molecular zone (CMZ), approximately centered on the Sgr B2 complex. We detect ∼25,000 Nyquist-sampled polarization pseudovectors, after applying the standard SOFIA cuts for minimum signal-to-noise ratios in fractional polarization and total intensity of three and 200, respectively. Analysis of the magnetic field orientation suggests a bimodal distribution in the field direction. This bimodal distribution shows enhancements in the distribution of field directions for orientations parallel and perpendicular to the Galactic plane, which are suggestive of a CMZ magnetic field configuration with polodial and torodial components. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of individual clouds included in our survey (i.e., Sgr B2, Sgr B2-NW, Sgr B2-Halo, Sgr B1, and Cloud E/F) shows they have fractional polarization values of 1%–10% at 214 μm, with most of the emission having values <5%. A few of these clouds (i.e., Sgr B2 and Cloud E/F) show relatively low fractional polarization values toward their cores and higher fractional polarization values toward their less dense peripheries. We also observe higher fractional polarization toward compact H ii regions, which could indicate an enhancement in the grain alignment in the dust surrounding these sources.

<div> 关键词: Parker Solar Probe, 磁性不连续, 阿尔文波, 风流, 质子加速<br />
<br />总结: 本研究通过对Parker Solar Probe观测到的Alfvénic和非Alfvénic风流中的局部质子能量化以及速度相空间中的动力学特征进行调查。在两种类型的风流中，最热的质子群集中在可压缩的一致磁场结构周围。在磁场结构周围，Alfvénic风流经历T∥的优先增强，而非Alfvénic风流经历T⊥的优先增强。此外，在两种风流中都存在质子束，但质子速度分布函数显示出不同的特征。非Alfvénic风流中存在热束，而Alfvénic风流中存在较冷的束。通过2.5D混合模拟实验，支持了Alfvénic和非Alfvénic风流中质子束具有不同的动力学特性和不同的起源的想法。在磁性不连续和间歇结构附近发现非Maxwellian分布函数，这表明小尺度结构的非线性形成与无碰撞等离子体中高度非热特征的发展密切相关。这些结果有助于理解一致结构在质子能量化中的作用以及它们对空间等离子体中无碰撞能量耗散过程的影响。 <br /> <div>
We investigate the local proton energization at magnetic discontinuities/intermittent structures and the corresponding kinetic signatures in velocity phase space in Alfvénic (high cross helicity) and non-Alfvénic (low cross helicity) wind streams observed by Parker Solar Probe. By means of the partial variance of increments method, we find that the hottest proton populations are localized around compressible, coherent magnetic structures in both types of wind. Analysis of parallel and perpendicular temperature distributions suggest that the Alfvénic wind undergoes preferential enhancements of T∥ at such structures, whereas the non-Alfvénic wind experiences preferential T⊥ enhancements. Although proton beams are present in both types of wind, the proton velocity distribution function displays distinct features. Hot beams, i.e., beams with beam-to-core perpendicular temperature T⊥,b/T⊥,c up to three times larger than the total distribution anisotropy, are found in the non-Alfvénic wind, whereas colder beams are in the Alfvénic wind. Our data analysis is complemented by 2.5D hybrid simulations in different geometrical setups, which support the idea that proton beams in Alfvénic and non-Alfvénic wind have different kinetic properties and different origins. The development of a perpendicular nonlinear cascade, favored in balanced turbulence, allows a preferential relative enhancement of the perpendicular plasma temperature and the formation of hot beams. Cold field-aligned beams are instead favored by Alfvén wave steepening. Non-Maxwellian distribution functions are found near discontinuities and intermittent structures, pointing to the fact that the nonlinear formation of small-scale structures is intrinsically related to the development of highly nonthermal features in collisionless plasmas. Our results contribute to understanding the role of different coherent structures in proton energization and their implication in collisionless energy dissipation processes in space plasmas.

X射线研究表明，星爆星系中存在大量的电荷交换现象，但总体交换通量和发生交换的区域尚不清楚。本文利用XMM-Newton观测M82星爆星系，通过盲源分离方法分析CCD数据，发现了一种具有增强的O-K线的成分，这与电荷交换过程吻合。利用XMM-Newton/RGS光谱分析确定，氧的禁闭态辐射到共振态的比率较高，C、N和O的K壳跃迁的发射线经电荷交换过程增强。电荷交换对Ne和Mg的发射线影响较小，因此准确估计电荷交换的贡献对于测量化学丰度至关重要。通过确定交换发射体积和低温等参数，发现电荷交换主要发生在等离子体和气体的界面区域，其温度由于热传导迅速下降。<br /><br /> <div>
Recent X-ray studies of starburst galaxies have found that charge exchange (CX) commonly occurs between outflowing hot plasma and cold gas, possibly from swept-up clouds. However, the total CX flux and the regions where CX occurs have been poorly understood. We present an analysis of XMM-Newton observations of M82, a prototype starburst galaxy, aiming to investigate these key properties of CX emission. We have used a blind source separation method in an image analysis of CCD data, which identified a component with the enhanced O–K lines expected from the CX process. Analyzing the XMM-Newton/RGS spectra from the regions identified by the image analysis, we have detected a high forbidden-to-resonance ratio of the O vii Heα triplet as well as several emission lines from K-shell transitions of C, N, and O that are enhanced by the CX process. CX is less responsible for the emission lines of Ne and Mg, and accurate estimation of the CX contribution is confirmed to be crucial in measuring chemical abundances. The temperature of the plasma acting as an electron receiver in the CX process is significantly lower compared to that of the plasma components responsible for most of the X-rays. From the low temperature and an estimation of the CX-emitting volume, we find that the CX primarily occurs in a limited region at interfaces between plasma and gas whose temperatures rapidly decrease due to thermal conduction.

Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) may be the link between stellar mass holes and the supermassive variety in the nuclei of galaxies, and globular clusters (GCs) may be one of the most promising environments for their formation. Here, we carry out a pilot study of the observability of tidal disruption events (TDEs) from 103M⊙ < M• < 105M⊙ IMBHs embedded in stellar cusps at the center of GCs. We model the long super-Eddington accretion phase and ensuing optical flare, and derive the disruption rate of main-sequence stars as a function of black hole mass and GC properties with the help of a 1D Fokker–Planck approach. The photospheric emission of the adiabatically expanding outflow dominates the observable radiation and peaks in the near-ultraviolet/optical bands, outshining the brightness of the (old) stellar population of GCs in Virgo for a period of months to years. A search for TDE events in a sample of nearly 4000 GCs observed at multiple epochs by the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey yields null results. Given our model predictions, this sample is too small to set stringent constraints on the present-day occupation fraction of GCs hosting IMBHs. Naturally, better simulations of the properties of the cluster central stellar distribution, TDE light curves, and rates, together with larger surveys of GCs are all needed to gain deeper insights into the presence of IMBHs in GCs.

Structures in circumstellar matter reflect both fast processes and quasi-equilibrium states. A geometrical diversity of emitting circumstellar matter is observed around evolved massive stars, in particular around B[e] supergiants. We recapitulate classical analytical tools of linear and nonlinear potential theory, such as Cole–Hopf transformation and Grad–Shafranov theory, and develop them further to explain the occurrence of the circumstellar matter structures and their dynamics. We use potential theory to formulate the nonlinear hydrodynamical equations and test dilatations of the quasi-equilibrium initial conditions. We find that a wide range of flow patterns can basically be generated and the timescales can switch, based on initial conditions, and lead to eruptive processes, reinforcing that the nonlinear fluid environment includes both quasi-stationary structures and fast processes like finite-time singularities. Some constraints and imposed symmetries can lead to Keplerian orbits, while other constraints can deliver quasi-Keplerian ones. The threshold is given by a characteristic density at the stellar surface.

Magnetic reconnection is one of the most universal processes in space plasma that is responsible for charged particle acceleration and the mixing and heating of plasma populations. In this paper we consider a triggering process of reconnection that is driven by interaction of two discontinuities: solar wind rotational discontinuity and tangential discontinuity at Earth’s magnetospheric boundary, the magnetopause. Combining multispacecraft measurements and global hybrid simulations, we show that solar wind discontinuities may drive the magnetopause reconnection and cause the mixing of the solar wind and magnetosphere plasmas around the magnetopause, well downstream of the solar wind flow. Since large-amplitude discontinuities are frequently observed in the solar wind and predicted for various stellar winds, our results of reconnection driven by the discontinuity–discontinuity interaction may have a broad application beyond the magnetosphere.

总结: 该研究使用贝叶斯定位搜索方法对脉冲星定时阵列数据进行分析，尝试寻找3C 66B中存在的偏心超大质量黑洞双星系统。经过模拟数据集的测试，发现当初偏心率小于0.5且对称质量比大于0.1时，方法有效性较好。然而，对NANOGrav 12.5年数据集进行真实偏心超大质量黑洞搜索时，并未发现明确信号，因此对该系统的PTA信号振幅和啁啾质量进行了95%上限估计，结果显示Earth term-only搜索的信号上限为88.1 ± 3.7 ns，而Earth+pulsar term搜索的信号上限为81.74 ± 0.86 ns，对应的95%啁啾质量上限分别为(1.98 ± 0.05) × 10^9M☉和(1.81 ± 0.01) × 10^9M☉。这些上限结果与基于电磁观测的3C 66B超大质量黑洞双星系统模型一致。 <div>
The radio galaxy 3C 66B has been hypothesized to host a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) at its center based on electromagnetic observations. Its apparent 1.05 yr period and low redshift (∼0.02) make it an interesting testbed to search for low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) using pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments. This source has been subjected to multiple searches for continuous GWs from a circular SMBHB, resulting in progressively more stringent constraints on its GW amplitude and chirp mass. In this paper, we develop a pipeline for performing Bayesian targeted searches for eccentric SMBHBs in PTA data sets, and test its efficacy by applying it to simulated data sets with varying injected signal strengths. We also search for a realistic eccentric SMBHB source in 3C 66B using the NANOGrav 12.5 yr data set employing PTA signal models containing Earth term-only as well as Earth+pulsar term contributions using this pipeline. Due to limitations in our PTA signal model, we get meaningful results only when the initial eccentricity e0 < 0.5 and the symmetric mass ratio η > 0.1. We find no evidence for an eccentric SMBHB signal in our data, and therefore place 95% upper limits on the PTA signal amplitude of 88.1 ± 3.7 ns for the Earth term-only and 81.74 ± 0.86 ns for the Earth+pulsar term searches for e0 < 0.5 and η > 0.1. Similar 95% upper limits on the chirp mass are (1.98 ± 0.05) × 109 and (1.81 ± 0.01) × 109M☉. These upper limits, while less stringent than those calculated from a circular binary search in the NANOGrav 12.5 yr data set, are consistent with the SMBHB model of 3C 66B developed from electromagnetic observations.

Phosphorus monoxide (PO) is a key brick of prebiotic chemistry since it is a potential precursor of phosphates, which are present in all living systems. Prompted by the lack of information on the different processes involved in the formation of PO, we have revisited and analyzed in detail the P(4S) + O2(3Σ−) and P(4S) + O2(1Δ) reactions leading to PO. The former process has been widely studied from both experimental and theoretical points of view, however, with contradictory results. We have used high-level quantum-chemical calculations to accurately describe the reaction mechanisms. Next, rate constants have been computed using a master equation approach based on ab initio transition state theory. By incorporating the P(4S) + O2(3Σ−) reaction in an astrochemical model, we have found that this reaction cannot be overlooked when aiming at a complete understanding of the PO abundance in regions dominated by shocks with speeds below 40 km s−1.

总结:<br />
本研究通过对近距离（0.02 < z < 0.06）螺旋+螺旋对和来自SDSS数据释放7的孤立对照样本的精心筛选，结合Galaxy Zoo 2和估计自旋-自旋对齐（SSA）的方法，系统地比较了相对定位对相互作用引起的星形成的影响。研究发现，当相邻星系的SF较高时，从垂直（90度）到良好对齐（0度）的相对定位会导致星形成增加。这种增强在邻近星系具有更高SF时尤为显著，表明液体动力学过程推动了相对定位效应。增加的液体动力学摩擦力，归因于增加的风压和良好对齐对的顺行轨道倾向，与我们的发现一致。 <div>
Enhanced star formation (SF) with star-forming neighboring galaxies bolsters the hydrodynamical contributions during paired interactions. Although the relative spin orientation between interacting galaxies can influence this effect, it has not been comprehensively explored. In this study, utilizing a meticulously curated sample of nearby (0.02 < z < 0.06) spiral+spiral pairs and an isolated control sample from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, coupled with Galaxy Zoo 2, and an approach to estimate spin–spin alignment (SSA), we systematically compare the impact of relative orientation, , on interaction-induced SF. We reveal that SSA plays a pivotal role along with the conventionally recognized parameters of projected separation and SF of neighboring galaxies. Our results show an increase in SF augmentation as configurations transition from perpendicular ( ) to well aligned ( ). This enhancement is especially pronounced when neighboring galaxies have higher SF, suggesting that hydrodynamical processes drive the effects of relative orientation. The heightened hydrodynamical friction, attributed to increased ram pressure and the propensity for prograde orbits in well-aligned pairs, is consistent with our findings.

<div> 关键词: 太阳, 欧氏爆发, 火焰, 振荡, 辐射

总结: 本文报告了2014年9月1日太阳背面发生的欧氏爆发引起的俯视和侧视观测。观测结果表明，冲击波在星际空间的速度超过了欧氏波，而日冕暗区的增长很小。这表明冲击波是由日冕物质抛射所驱动，而欧氏波在日冕物质抛射侧翼的横向运动停止后自由传播。通过三维重建确定的火焰振荡方向进一步支持了这一观点。此外，对欧氏波引起的火焰和火绳振荡进行了详细研究，揭示了初始振幅、周期、减振时间和减振比分别为16.08和2.15 Mm、1769和1863 s、2640和1259 s、1.49和0.68。根据火焰和火绳振荡测量得出的磁场径向分量分别为5.4和4.1 G。进而利用火焰和火绳振荡的起始时间，确定了欧氏波的平均速度分别为498和451 km/s。 <br /><br /> <div>
In this paper, we report our multi-angle observations of the transverse oscillation of a prominence and a filament induced by an EUV wave originating from the far side of the Sun on 2014 September 1. The prominence oscillation was simultaneously observed by both the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory spacecraft and the Extreme-UltraViolet Imager on board the Behind Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory spacecraft. The speed of the shock traveling in interplanetary space exceeds that of the EUV wave, and the coronal dimming area experiences minimal growth. This indicates that the shock wave is driven by the CME, while the EUV wave freely propagates after the lateral motion of the CME flanks has stopped. The observed oscillation direction of the prominence, determined through three-dimensional reconstruction, further supports this point. Moreover, detailed investigation of the oscillations in the prominence and filament induced by the EUV wave reveals initial amplitudes of 16.08 and 2.15 Mm, periods of 1769 and 1863 s, damping timescales of 2640 and 1259 s, and damping ratios of 1.49 and 0.68, respectively. The radial component of the magnetic field, as derived from the prominence and filament oscillation measurements, was estimated to be 5.4 and 4.1 G, respectively. In turn, utilizing the onset times of both the prominence and filament oscillation, the average speeds of the EUV wave are determined to be 498 and 451 km s−1, respectively.

<title>2.5D Magnetohydrodynamic Simulation of the Formation and Evolution of Plasmoids in Coronal Current Sheets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In the present paper, using MPI-AMRVAC, we perform a 2.5D numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the dynamics and associated thermodynamical evolution of an initially force-free Harris current sheet subjected to an external velocity perturbation under the condition of uniform resistivity. The amplitude of the magnetic field is taken to be 10 G, typical of the solar corona. We impose a Gaussian velocity pulse across this current sheet that mimics the interaction of fast magnetoacoustic waves with a current sheet in the corona. This leads to a variety of dynamics and plasma processes in the current sheet, which is initially quasi-static. The initial pulse interacts with the current sheet and splits into a pair of counterpropagating wavefronts, which form a rarefied region that leads to an inflow and a thinning of the current sheet. The thinning results in Petschek-type magnetic reconnection followed by a tearing instability and plasmoid formation. The reconnection outflows containing outward-moving plasmoids have accelerated motions with velocities ranging from 105 to 303 km s−1. The average temperature and density of the plasmoids are found to be 8 MK and twice the background density of the solar corona, respectively. These estimates of the velocity, temperature, and density of the plasmoids are similar to values reported from various solar coronal observations. Therefore, we infer that the external triggering of a quasi-static current sheet by a single-velocity pulse is capable of initiating magnetic reconnection and plasmoid formation in the absence of a localized enhancement of resistivity in the solar corona.

<title>Multiwavelength Pulsations and Surface Temperature Distribution in the Middle-aged Pulsar B1055–52</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a detailed study of the X-ray emission from PSR B1055–52 using XMM-Newton observations from 2019 and 2000. The phase-integrated X-ray emission from this pulsar is poorly described by existing models of neutron star atmospheres. Instead, we confirm that, similar to other middle-aged pulsars, the best-fitting spectral model consists of two blackbody components, with substantially different temperatures and emitting areas, and a nonthermal component characterized by a power law. Our phase-resolved X-ray spectral analysis using this three-component model reveals variations in the thermal emission parameters with the pulsar’s rotational phase. These variations suggest a nonuniform temperature distribution across the neutron star’s surface, including the cold thermal component and probable hot spot(s). Such a temperature distribution can be caused by external and internal heating processes, likely a combination thereof. We observe very high pulse fractions, 60%–80% in the 0.7–1.5 keV range, dominated by the hot blackbody component. This could be related to temperature nonuniformity and potential beaming effects in an atmosphere. We find indication of a second hot spot that appears at lower energies (0.15–0.3 keV) than the first hot spot (0.5–1.5 keV) in the X-ray light curves and is offset by about half a rotation period. This finding aligns with the nearly orthogonal rotator geometry suggested by radio observations of this interpulse pulsar. If the hot spots are associated with polar caps, a possible explanation for their temperature asymmetry could be an offset magnetic dipole and/or an additional toroidal magnetic field component in the neutron star crust.

<title>Late Engine Activity in Neutron Star Mergers and Its Cocoon: An Alternative Scenario for the Blue Kilonova</title>

Follow-up observations of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) have continuously unveiled late extended/plateau emissions, attributed to jet launch due to late engine activity, the nature of which remains enigmatic. Observations of GW170817 have confirmed that sGRBs are linked to neutron star (NS) mergers, and discovered a kilonova (KN) transient. Nevertheless, the origin of the early blue KN in GW170817 remains unclear. Here, we investigate the propagation of late jets in the merger ejecta. By analytically modeling jet dynamics, we determine the properties of the jet-heated cocoon, and estimate its cooling emission. Our results reveal that late jets generate significantly brighter cocoons compared to prompt jets, primarily due to reduced energy loss by adiabatic cooling. Notably, with typical late jets, emission from the cocoon trapped inside the ejecta can reproduce the blue KN emission. We estimate that the forthcoming Einstein Probe mission will detect the early cocoon emission at a rate of yr−1, and that optical/UV follow-ups in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O5 run will be able to detect cocoon emission events. As an electromagnetic counterpart, this emission provides an independent tool to probe NS mergers in the Universe, complementing insights from sGRBs and gravitational waves.

As the number of known Galactic structures mounts thanks to the Gaia Space Telescope, it is now pertinent to study methods for disentangling structures occupying the same regions of the Milky Way. Indeed, understanding the precise form of each individual structure and the interactions between structures may aid in understanding their origins and chronology. Moreover, accounting for known structures allows one to probe still finer Galactic structure. In order to demonstrate this, we have developed an odd low-pass filter (OLPF), which removes smaller, odd-parity structures like the vertical waves, and use the filtered data to examine the location of the Galaxy’s midplane. We find that the radial wave identified by Xu et al. continues inward to at least the Sun’s location, with an amplitude that decreases toward the inner, denser parts of the disk, consistent with a simple, qualitative simulation. Additionally, we employ the OLPF results to determine the solar offset, z⊙, with smaller structures filtered out. We find that z⊙ = 34.2 ± 0.3 pc.

High-energy photons can produce electron–positron pairs upon interacting with the extragalactic background light. These pairs will in turn be deflected by the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF), before possibly up-scattering photons of the cosmic microwave background, thereby initiating an electromagnetic cascade. The nonobservation of an excess of GeV photons and an extended halo around individual blazars due to this electromagnetic cascade can be used to constrain the properties of the IGMF. In this work, we use publicly available data of 1ES 0229+200 obtained with the Fermi Large Area Telescope and the High Energy Stereoscopic System to constrain cosmological MHD simulations of various magnetogenesis scenarios, and find that all models without a strong space-filling primordial component or overoptimistic dynamo amplifications can be excluded at the 95% confidence level. In fact, we find that the fraction of space filled by a strong IGMF has to be at least f ≳ 0.67, thus excluding most astrophysical production scenarios. Moreover, we set lower limits of B0 > 5.1 × 10−15 G (B0 > 1.0 × 10−14 G) for a space-filling primordial IGMF for a blazar activity time of Δt = 104 yr (Δt = 107 yr).

<title>Little Red Dots: An Abundant Population of Faint Active Galactic Nuclei at z ∼ 5 Revealed by the EIGER and FRESCO JWST Surveys</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Characterizing the prevalence and properties of faint active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the early Universe is key for understanding the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and determining their role in cosmic reionization. We perform a spectroscopic search for broad Hα emitters at z ≈ 4–6 using deep JWST/NIRCam imaging and wide field slitless spectroscopy from the EIGER and FRESCO surveys. We identify 20 Hα lines at z = 4.2–5.5 that have broad components with line widths from ∼1200–3700 km s−1, contributing ∼30%–90% of the total line flux. We interpret these broad components as being powered by accretion onto SMBHs with implied masses ∼107–8M⊙. In the UV luminosity range MUV,AGN+host = −21 to −18, we measure number densities of ≈10−5 cMpc−3. This is an order of magnitude higher than expected from extrapolating quasar UV luminosity functions (LFs). Yet, such AGN are found in only <1% of star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 5. The number density discrepancy is much lower when compared to the broad Hα LF. The SMBH mass function agrees with large cosmological simulations. In two objects, we detect complex Hα profiles that we tentatively interpret as caused by absorption signatures from dense gas fueling SMBH growth and outflows. We may be witnessing early AGN feedback that will clear dust-free pathways through which more massive blue quasars are seen. We uncover a strong correlation between reddening and the fraction of total galaxy luminosity arising from faint AGN. This implies that early SMBH growth is highly obscured and that faint AGN are only minor contributors to cosmic reionization.

<title>Turbulent Vortex with Moderate Dust Settling Probed by Scattering-induced Polarization in the IRS 48 System</title>

We investigate the crescent-shaped dust trap in the transition disk Oph IRS 48 using well-resolved (sub)millimeter polarimetric observations at ALMA Band 7 (870 μm). The dust polarization map reveals patterns consistent with dust-scattering-induced polarization. There is a relative displacement between the polarized flux and the total flux, which holds the key to understanding the dust scale heights in this system. We model the polarization observations, focusing on the effects of dust scale heights. We find that the interplay between the inclination-induced polarization and the polarization arising from radiation anisotropy in the crescent determines the observed polarization; the anisotropy is controlled by the dust optical depth along the midplane, which is, in turn, determined by the dust scale height in the vertical direction. We find that the dust grains can be neither completely settled nor well mixed with the gas. The completely settled case produces little radial displacement between the total and polarized flux, while the well-mixed case produces an azimuthal pattern in the outer (radial) edge of the crescent that is not observed. Our best model has a gas-to-dust scale height ratio of 2 and can reproduce both the radial displacement and the azimuthal displacement between the total and polarized flux. We infer an effective turbulence α parameter of approximately 0.0001–0.005. The scattering-induced polarization provides insight into a turbulent vortex with a moderate level of dust settling in the IRS 48 system, which is hard to achieve otherwise.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the first X-ray polarimetric study of the dipping accreting neutron star 4U 1624−49 with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer. We report a detection of polarization in the nondip time intervals with a confidence level of 99.99%. We find an average polarization degree (PD) of 3.1% ± 0.7% and a polarization angle of 81° ± 6° east of north in the 2–8 keV band. We report an upper limit on the PD of 22% during the X-ray dips with 95% confidence. The PD increases with energy, reaching from 3.0% ± 0.9% in the 4–6 keV band to 6% ± 2% in the 6–8 keV band. This indicates the polarization likely arises from Comptonization. The high PD observed is unlikely to be produced by Comptonization in the boundary layer or spreading layer alone. It can be produced by the addition of an extended geometrically thin slab corona covering part of the accretion disk, as assumed in previous models of dippers, and/or a reflection component from the accretion disk.

We present the results obtained from detailed X-ray timing and spectral studies of X-ray pulsar Swift J0243.6+6124 during its giant and normal X-ray outbursts between 2017 and 2023 observed by the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). We focused on a timing analysis of the normal outbursts. A distinct break is found in the power density spectra of the source. The corresponding break frequency and slopes of the power laws around the break vary with luminosity, indicating a change in the accretion dynamics with the mass accretion rate. Interestingly, we detected quasiperiodic oscillations within a specific luminosity range, providing further insights into the underlying physical processes. We also studied the neutron star spin period evolution and a luminosity variation in the pulse profile during the recent 2023 outburst. The spectral analysis was conducted comprehensively for the giant and all other normal outbursts. We identified a double transition at luminosities of ≈7.5 × 1037 and 2.1 × 1038 erg s−1 in the evolution of continuum parameters like the photon index and cutoff energy with luminosity. This indicates three distinct accretion modes experienced by the source, mainly during the giant X-ray outburst. A soft blackbody component with a temperature of 0.08–0.7 keV is also detected in the spectra. The observed temperature undergoes a discontinuous transition when the pulsar evolves from a sub- to super-Eddington state. Notably, in addition to an evolving 6–7 keV iron line complex, a 1 keV emission line was observed during the super-Eddington state of the source, implying X-ray reflection from the accretion disk or outflow material.

<div> 盘状星系、寿命分布、Weibull分布、星际盘消退、行星形成模型
<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了原行星盘的寿命分布，指出了不同星际盘的存在时间差异，提出了Weibull分布用于描述寿命分布的可能性，重点讨论了低质量恒星（谱型M3.7至M6，Ms≈0.1–0.24 M⊙）的盘寿命。结果表明，在初始盘分数为0.65时，Weibull分布（k = 2.34，λ = 11.22）和高斯分布（σ = 9.52，μ = 9.52）能较好地拟合观测数据。最终挑战是量化盘的寿命多样性与行星多样性之间的联系。 <br /> <div>
While most protoplanetary disks lose their gas within less than 10 Myr, individual disk lifetimes vary from <1 Myr to ≫20 Myr, with some disks existing for 40 Myr. Mean disk half-lifetimes hide this diversity; only a so-far nonexisting disk lifetime distribution could capture this fact. The benefit of a disk lifetime distribution would be twofold. First, it would provide a stringent test on disk evolution theories. Second, it could function as an input for planet formation models. Here, we derive such a disk lifetime distribution. We heuristically test different standard distribution forms for their ability to account for the observed disk fractions at certain ages. We here concentrate on the distribution for low-mass stars (spectral types M3.7–M6, Ms ≈ 0.1–0.24 M⊙) because disk lifetimes depend on stellar mass. A Weibull-type distribution (k = 1.78, λ = 9.15) describes the observational data if all stars have a disk at a cluster age tc = 0. However, a better match exists for lower initial disk fractions. For f(t=0) = 0.65, a Weibull distribution (k = 2.34, λ = 11.22) and a Gaussian distribution (σ = 9.52, μ = 9.52) fit the data similarly well. All distributions have in common that they are wide, and most disks are dissipated at ages >5 Myr. The next challenge is to quantitatively link the diversity of disk lifetimes to the diversity in planets.

总结:<br /><br />研究团队开发了一个名为CAT-PUMA的工具，利用机器学习算法，通过监督学习对CME的到达时间和地球影响进行预测。他们使用了回归模型和分类模型来进行CME到达时间的预测和地球影响的分类。这种应用提供了关于太空天气事件地球影响的定量指示。研究发现，机器学习模型在回归和分类任务中表现良好，但实际潜力和应用并不总是直观的。为了解决这一挑战，他们使用了模型解释技术，特别是Shap值，以获得对这些模型影响的定量洞见。 <div>
Space weather phenomena have long captured the attention of the scientific community, and along with recent technological developments, the awareness that such phenomena can interfere with human activities on Earth has grown considerably. Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are among the main drivers of space weather. Therefore, developing tools to provide information on their arrival at Earth's nearby space has become increasingly important. Liu et al. developed a tool, called CME Arrival Time Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms (CAT-PUMA), to obtain fast and accurate predictions of CME transit time. This present work aims at the expansion of the CAT-PUMA concept, employing supervised learning to obtain vital information about the arrival of CMEs at Earth. In this study, we report the results of our work following the implementation of supervised regression and classification models in the CAT-PUMA framework. We conducted a comparison of various machine learning models in the context of predicting the transit time of CMEs and classifying CMEs as either Earth impacting or non-impacting. In this way, we are able to provide information on the possibility of a CME reaching Earth relying on CME features and solar wind parameters measured at take-off. This application thus provides quantitative indications about the geoeffectiveness of these space weather events. While machine-learning models can demonstrate fairly strong performance in regression and classification tasks, it is not always straightforward to extrapolate their practical potential and real-world applicability. To address this challenge, we employed model interpretation techniques, specifically Shap values, to gain quantitative insights into the limitations that affect these models.

总结:
本研究使用James Clerk Maxwell望远镜对星云G202.3+2.5进行了热尘埃极化观测，发现平均磁场方向与纤维垂直，并在四个子区域显示不同的行为。利用IRAM观测获得的动力学信息，估计了平面磁场强度，并在四个区域中进行了相关重要性研究。此外，研究了DCF和ADF方法在投影效应上的影响。根据模拟案例发现，当使用DCF或ADF方法时，3D磁场强度可能低估了约3倍，可能进一步低估/高估相关参数。 <br /><br /> <div>
We observe the magnetic field morphology toward a nearby star-forming filamentary cloud, G202.3+2.5, using James Clerk Maxwell Telescope/POL-2 850 μm thermal dust polarization observations with an angular resolution of 14.″4 (∼0.053 pc). The average magnetic field orientation is found to be perpendicular to the filaments, while showing different behaviors in the four subregions, suggesting various effects from the filaments’ collision in these subregions. With the kinematics obtained by the observation by IRAM, we estimate the plane-of-sky magnetic field strength by two methods, the classical Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi (DCF) method and the angular dispersion function (ADF) method, giving Bpos,dcf and Bpos,adf of ∼90 and ∼53 μG. We study the relative importance between the gravity (G), magnetic field (B), and turbulence (T) in the four subregions, and find G > T > B, G ≥ T > B, G ∼ T > B, and T > G > B in the north tail, west trunk, south root, and east wing, respectively. In addition, we investigate the projection effects on the DCF and ADF methods, based on a similar simulation case, and find the 3D magnetic field strength may be underestimated by a factor of ∼3 if applying the widely used statistical Bpos-to-B3D factor when using the DCF or ADF methods, which may further underestimate/overestimate the related parameters.

<div> 关键词: EROs, 红外相机, 光谱能量分布, 高红移, 星系演化

总结: 一项最新研究发现了一群极端红色天体(EROs)，它们是由詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜发现的，在红外摄像机的颜色上具有双峰光谱能量分布(SEDs)，并且具有高红移。研究发现这些EROs可能是包含尘埃的星系或者被遮蔽的活动星系核(AGN)，但无法确定它们的确切特征。此外，研究指出如果这些EROs被确认为高红移的类星体，将导致先前关于高红移的数量密度增加达60倍。因此，未来需要在中红外波段进行进一步的研究以确定这些EROs的真实性质和将其置于恰当的星系演化背景中。<br /><br /> <div>
We study a new population of extremely red objects (EROs) recently discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) based on their NIRCam colors F277W − F444W > 1.5 mag. We find 37 EROs in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) field with F444W < 28 mag and photometric redshifts between 5 < z < 7, with median . Surprisingly, despite their red long-wavelength colors, these EROs have blue short-wavelength colors (F150W − F200W ∼ 0 mag) indicative of bimodal spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with a red, steep slope in the rest-frame optical, and a blue, flat slope in the rest-frame UV. Moreover, all these EROs are unresolved, point-like sources in all NIRCam bands. We analyze the SEDs of eight of them with MIRI and NIRSpec observations using stellar population models and active galactic nucleus (AGN) templates. We find that dusty galaxies or obscured AGNs provide similarly good SED fits but different stellar properties: massive and dusty, ∼ 10 and AV ≳ 3 mag, or low mass and obscured, ∼ 7.5 and AV ∼ 0 mag, hosting an obscured quasi-stellar object (QSO). SED modeling does not favor either scenario, but their unresolved sizes are more suggestive of AGNs. If any EROs are confirmed to have ≳ 10.5, it would increase the pre-JWST number density at z > 7 by up to a factor ∼60. Similarly, if they are QSOs with luminosities in the Lbol > 1045–46 erg s−1 range, their number would exceed that of bright blue QSOs by more than three orders of magnitude. Additional photometry at mid-infrared wavelengths will reveal the true nature of the red continuum emission in these EROs and will place this puzzling population in the right context of galaxy evolution.

<div> WR 137, JWST, NIRISS, AMI, dust formation
总结:
WR 137是一个大质量双星系统，研究了其通过JWST的NIRISS的AMI观测新形成的尘埃。通过三种独立的软件工具对观测数据进行了分析和校准，并使用三种独立的软件工具进行了图像重建。观测结果显示WR 137中心有一个明亮的核心和一个向西北方向延伸的约300毫角秒的线性丝状结构。通过对碰撞风尘埃凝结的分析，研究表明WR 137的尘埃形成在轨道平面内，由O9伴星增强的赤道质量流失引起。 <div>
We present infrared aperture-masking interferometry (AMI) observations of newly formed dust from the colliding winds of the massive binary Wolf–Rayet system WR 137 with JWST using the Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS). NIRISS AMI observations of WR 137 and a point-spread function calibrator star, HD 228337, were taken using the F380M and F480M filters in 2022 July and August as part of the Director’s Discretionary Early Release Science program #1349. Interferometric observables (squared visibilities and closure phases) from the WR 137 “interferogram” were extracted and calibrated using three independent software tools: ImPlaneIA, AMICAL, and SAMpip. The analysis of the calibrated observables yielded consistent values except for slightly discrepant closure phases measured by ImPlaneIA. Based on all three sets of calibrated observables, images were reconstructed using three independent software tools: BSMEM, IRBis, and SQUEEZE. All reconstructed image combinations generated consistent images in both F380M and F480M filters. The reconstructed images of WR 137 reveal a bright central core with a ∼300 mas linear filament extending to the northwest. A geometric colliding-wind model with dust production constrained to the orbital plane of the binary system and enhanced as the system approaches periapsis provided a general agreement with the interferometric observables and reconstructed images. Based on a colliding-wind dust condensation analysis, we suggest that dust formation within the orbital plane of WR 137 is induced by enhanced equatorial mass loss from the rapidly rotating O9 companion star, whose axis of rotation is aligned with that of the orbit.

总结: 
Hα发射，代表着年轻的超新星残骸（SNR），通过积分视场光谱学研究，19个区域符合要求，其中四个位置与先前发现的超新星相匹配，推测这些物体是由超新星喷发物与周围密集物质相互作用而形成的年轻SNR。这些SNR候选的恒星年龄普遍比核心坍缩（CC）超新星的位置年龄低约0.5 dex，表明它们的原型星可能寿命更短、质量更大。这项工作的方法为用积分视场光谱学研究附近的超新星打开了新的研究窗口。 <div>
We present results from a systematic search for broad (≥ 400 km s−1) Hα emission in integral field spectroscopy data cubes of ∼1200 nearby galaxies obtained with PMAS and MUSE. We found 19 unique regions that pass our quality cuts, four of which match the locations of previously discovered supernovae (SNe): one Type IIP and three Type IIn, including the well-known SN 2005ip. We suggest that these objects are young Supernova remnants (SNRs), with bright and broad Hα emission powered by the interaction between the SN ejecta and dense circumstellar material. The stellar ages measured at the locations of these SNR candidates are systematically lower by about 0.5 dex than those measured at the locations of core-collapse (CC) SNe, implying that their progenitors might be shorter lived and therefore more massive than a typical CCSN progenitor. The methods laid out in this work open a new window into the study of nearby SNe with integral field spectroscopy.

时间尺度为60天的强烈余辉映射活动显示，著名的紫外发射线对连续发射的波动有显著变化。在14个月的观测过程中，UV发射线的响应表现出不同的时间延迟，需要包括每条发射线的缓慢变化背景才能进行一维回声映射模型拟合。这些变化在C iv光线曲线中更为明显，这是Mrk 817中受固有吸收影响最小且不太与相邻发射线混合的光谱线。我们确定了五个具有明显发射线响应的时间窗口，并测量了它们对应的时间延迟，范围为2至13天。这些时间窗口可能与同一时间段内发生的UV和X射线遮挡的变化有关。最短的时间延迟出现在遮挡减弱的时期，而最长的延迟出现在遮挡增加的时期。我们认为遮挡出流屏蔽了广泛的UV线，免受电离的连续发射。由此产生的离子连续发射的光谱能量分布的变化，被远离核心的云所观察，这是造成线响应变化的原因。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究利用哈勃空间望远镜对Seyfert 1星系Mrk 817进行了密集的余辉映射活动，发现UV发射线对连续辐射的响应有显著变化，随着时间的推移呈现出不同的时间延迟。研究指出，这些时间延迟与UV和X射线遮挡的变化有关，最短的时间延迟出现在遮挡减弱的时期，而最长的延迟出现在遮挡增加的时期。此外，研究还提出了遮挡出流屏蔽了广泛的UV线的假设，并解释了因此导致的线响应变化。 <div>
An intensive reverberation mapping campaign of the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 817 using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope revealed significant variations in the response of broad UV emission lines to fluctuations in the continuum emission. The response of the prominent UV emission lines changes over an ∼60 day duration, resulting in distinctly different time lags in the various segments of the light curve over the 14 month observing campaign. One-dimensional echo-mapping models fit these variations if a slowly varying background is included for each emission line. These variations are more evident in the C iv light curve, which is the line least affected by intrinsic absorption in Mrk 817 and least blended with neighboring emission lines. We identify five temporal windows with a distinct emission-line response, and measure their corresponding time delays, which range from 2 to 13 days. These temporal windows are plausibly linked to changes in the UV and X-ray obscuration occurring during these same intervals. The shortest time lags occur during periods with diminishing obscuration, whereas the longest lags occur during periods with rising obscuration. We propose that the obscuring outflow shields the broad UV lines from the ionizing continuum. The resulting change in the spectral energy distribution of the ionizing continuum, as seen by clouds at a range of distances from the nucleus, is responsible for the changes in the line response.

<div> Spitzer/IRS spectra, interstellar features, amorphous silicate dust, extinction profile, peak wavelength<br />
<br />总结:<br />本文利用"对比法"确定了硅酸盐消光谱线，发现9.7μm特征峰值波长约为9.2-9.8μm，而18μm特征峰值波长约为18-22μm。9.7μm特征峰值波长似乎随着恒星光谱类型的变化而变短，而全宽却与光谱类型似乎无关，这可能与星周硅酸盐发射有关。9.7μm硅酸盐吸收光学深度Δτ9.7随J-KS颜色过剩增加而增加。此外，9.7μm特征的峰值波长和全宽的相关系数为0.4，表明存在正相关关系。研究方法与用大气模型的光谱能量分布替换参考星进行了比较，结果显示没有显著差异。 <div>
The 9.7 and 18 μm interstellar spectral features, arising from the Si–O stretching and O–Si–O bending modes of amorphous silicate dust, are the strongest extinction features in the infrared. Here we use the “pair method” to determine the silicate extinction profile by comparing the Spitzer/IRS spectra of 49 target stars with obvious extinction with those of unreddened stars of the same spectral type. The 9.7 μm extinction profile is determined from all the 49 stars and the 18 μm profile is determined from six stars. It is found that the profile has a peak wavelength at ∼9.2–9.8 and ∼18–22 μm, respectively. The peak wavelength of the 9.7 μm feature seems to become shorter for stars of late spectral types; meanwhile the FWHM seems irrelevant to the spectral type, which may be related to circumstellar silicate emission. The silicate optical depth at 9.7 μm, Δτ9.7, mostly increases with the color excess in J − KS ( ). The mean ratio of the visual extinction to the 9.7 μm silicate absorption optical depth is AV/Δτ9.7 ≈ 17.8, in close agreement with that of the solar-neighborhood diffuse interstellar medium. When , this proportionality changes. The correlation coefficient between the peak wavelength and the FWHM of the 9.7 μm feature is 0.4, which indicates a positive correlation considering the uncertainties of the parameters. The method is compared with replacing the reference star by an atmospheric model spectral energy distribution and no significant difference is observed.

<div> SEP事件, 太阳能粒子, 磁场, EUV波, 飞行器

太阳能粒子加速的主要驱动因素被认为是由日冕质量抛射引起的冲击波。极紫外波被认为是太阳表面上冲击波的传播足迹。SEP研究中的一个关键问题是SEP释放的时间与EUV波与观测者磁性连接的时间之间的关系。利用帕克太阳探测器（PSP）和太阳轨道飞行器（SolO）对太阳附近的测量，我们调查了发生在2021年9月28日的一个SEP事件，SolO、PSP、STEREO-A和近地飞行器在不同位置观测到该事件。在此期间，SolO、PSP和STEREO-A相对于SEP源区有相似的标称磁场足点，但处于不同的太阳系距离。我们发现，在这四个地点估计的SEP释放时间相对于EUV波截获连接到每个飞行器的标称磁场足点的时间延迟约30-60分钟。结合无线电、白光和EUV的多波长观测和几何冲击模型，我们分析了此事件中的冲击特性，并讨论了SEP的加速和延迟释放过程，以及使用EUV波确定SEP加速和释放时间的准确性和局限性。 <br /><br />总结: SEP事件的驱动因素主要是由冠状质量抛射引起的冲击波，而极紫外波被认为是在太阳表面的冲击痕迹。文章对一个SEP事件的观测进行了研究和分析，发现SEP释放时间与EUV波截获连接到观测器的标称磁场足点的时间之间存在一定程度的延迟。通过多波长观测和几何冲击模型的分析，讨论了SEP的加速和延迟释放过程，以及使用EUV波确定SEP加速和释放时间的准确性和局限性。 <div>
The main driver of the acceleration of solar energetic particles (SEPs) is believed to be shocks driven by coronal mass ejections. Extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) waves are thought to be the propagating footprint of the shock on the solar surface. One of the key questions in SEP research is the timing of the SEP release with respect to the time when the EUV wave magnetically connects with an observer. Taking advantage of close-to-the-Sun measurements by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO), we investigate an SEP event that occurred on 2021 September 28 and was observed at different locations by SolO, PSP, STEREO-A, and near-Earth spacecraft. During this time, SolO, PSP, and STEREO-A shared similar nominal magnetic footpoints relative to the SEP source region but were at different heliocentric distances. We find that the SEP release times estimated at these four locations were delayed compared to the times when the EUV wave intercepted the footpoints of the nominal magnetic fields connecting to each spacecraft by around 30–60 minutes. Combining observations in multiple wavelengths of radio, white light, and EUV with a geometrical shock model, we analyze the associated shock properties and discuss the acceleration and delayed release processes of SEPs in this event as well as the accuracy and limitations of using EUV waves to determine the SEP acceleration and release times.

IGR J17091–3624 is a black hole X-ray binary (BHXB), often referred to as the “twin” of GRS 1915+105 because it is the only other known BHXB that can show exotic “heartbeat”-like variability that is highly structured and repeated. Here, we report on observations of IGR J17091–3624 from its 2022 outburst, where we detect an unusually coherent quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) when the broadband variability is low (total fractional rms ≲6%) and the spectrum is dominated by the accretion disk. Such spectral and variability behavior is characteristic of the soft state of typical BHXBs (i.e., those that do not show heartbeats), but we also find that this QPO is strongest when there is some exotic heartbeat-like variability (so-called Class V variability). This QPO is detected at frequencies between 5 and 8 Hz and has Q factors (defined as the QPO frequency divided by the width) ≳50, making it one of the most highly coherent low-frequency QPOs ever seen in a BHXB. The extremely high Q factor makes this QPO distinct from typical low-frequency QPOs that are conventionally classified into type-A/B/C QPOs. Instead, we find evidence that archival observations of GRS 1915+105 also showed a similarly high-coherence QPO in the same frequency range, suggesting that this unusually coherent and strong QPO may be unique to BHXBs that can exhibit “heartbeat”-like variability.

在IC 342附近的100 m Robert C.

We report observations of the ground state transitions of 12CO, 13CO, C18O, HCN, and HCO+ at 88–115 GHz in the inner region of the nearby galaxy IC 342. These data were obtained with the 16 pixel spectroscopic focal plane array Argus on the 100 m Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) at 6″–9″ resolution. In the nuclear bar region, the intensity distributions of 12CO(1–0) and 13CO(1–0) emission trace moderate densities, and differ from the dense gas distributions sampled in C18O(1–0), HCN(1–0), and HCO+(1–0). We observe a constant HCN(1–0)-to-HCO+(1–0) ratio of 1.2 ± 0.1 across the whole ∼1 kpc bar. This indicates that the HCN(1–0) and HCO+(1–0) lines have intermediate optical depth, and that the corresponding of the gas producing the emission is of order 104.5−6 cm−3. We show that HCO+(1–0) is thermalized and HCN(1–0) is close to thermalization. The very tight correlation between the HCN(1–0) and HCO+(1–0) intensities across the 1 kpc bar suggests that this ratio is more sensitive to the relative abundance of the two species than to the gas density. We confirm an angular offset (∼10″) between the spatial distribution of molecular gas and the star formation sites. Finally, we find a breakdown of the LIR– correlation at high spatial resolution due to the effect of incomplete sampling of star-forming regions by HCN emission in IC 342. The scatter of the LIR– relation decreases as the spatial scale increases from 10″ to 30″ (170–510 pc), and is comparable to the scatter of the global relation at a scale of 340 pc.

On 2022 February 15–16, multiple spacecraft measured one of the most intense solar energetic particle (SEP) events observed so far in Solar Cycle 25. This study provides an overview of interesting observations made by multiple spacecraft during this event. Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and BepiColombo were close to each other at 0.34–0.37 au (a radial separation of ∼0.03 au) as they were impacted by the flank of the associated coronal mass ejection (CME). At about 100° in the retrograde direction and 1.5 au away from the Sun, the radiation detector on board the Curiosity surface rover observed the largest ground-level enhancement on Mars since surface measurements began. At intermediate distances (0.7–1.0 au), the presence of stream interaction regions (SIRs) during the SEP arrival time provides additional complexities regarding the analysis of the distinct contributions of CME-driven versus SIR-driven events in observations by spacecraft such as Solar Orbiter and STEREO-A, and by near-Earth spacecraft like ACE, SOHO, and WIND. The proximity of PSP and BepiColombo also enables us to directly compare their measurements and perform cross-calibration for the energetic particle instruments on board the two spacecraft. Our analysis indicates that energetic proton measurements from BepiColombo and PSP are in reasonable agreement with each other to within a factor of ∼1.35. Finally, this study introduces the various ongoing efforts that will collectively improve our understanding of this impactful, widespread SEP event.

ALMA观测了绿谷中的三个星系和两个星系的密度气体示踪物，研究发现，密度气体丰度对星系内的特定星形成率影响不大，星系内特定星形成率主要受SFEmol和SFEdense影响，而不是受密度气体的影响。与其他研究相比，绿谷样本显示出更低的全局SFEmol和更低的SFEdense，但在密度气体丰度方面与星形成和星暴星系相似。因此，绿谷星系中正常的分子气体含量受到抑制，主要是由于降低的SFEdense而不是密度气体的缺乏。<br /><br />总结：ALMA观测了绿谷中的三个星系和两个星系的密度气体示踪物，研究发现，密度气体丰度对星系内的特定星形成率影响不大，星系内特定星形成率主要受SFEmol和SFEdense影响，而不是受密度气体的影响。与其他研究相比，绿谷样本显示出更低的全局SFEmol和更低的SFEdense，但在密度气体丰度方面与星形成和星暴星系相似。因此，绿谷星系中正常的分子气体含量受到抑制，主要是由于降低的SFEdense而不是密度气体的缺乏。 <div>
We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of two dense gas tracers, HCN (1−0) and HCO+ (1-0) for three galaxies in the green valley and two galaxies on the star-forming main sequence with comparable molecular gas fractions as traced by the CO (1−0) emissions, selected from the ALMaQUEST survey. We investigate whether the deficit of molecular gas star formation efficiency (SFEmol) that leads to the low specific star formation rate (sSFR) in these green valley galaxies is due to a lack of dense gas (characterized by the dense gas fraction fdense) or the low star formation efficiency of dense gas (SFEdense). We find that SFEmol as traced by the CO emissions, when considering both star-forming and retired spaxels together, is tightly correlated with SFEdense and depends only weakly on fdense. The sSFR on kiloparsec scales is primarily driven by SFEmol and SFEdense, followed by the dependence on fmol, and is least correlated with fdense or the dense-gas-to-stellar mass ratio (Rdense). When compared with other works in the literature, we find that our green valley sample shows lower global SFEmol and lower SFEdense while exhibiting similar dense gas fractions when compared to star-forming and starburst galaxies. We conclude that the star formation of the three green valley galaxies with a normal abundance of molecular gas is suppressed, mainly due to the reduced SFEdense rather than the lack of dense gas.

<title>Long-term Evolution in Ionization of Ejecta Illuminated by Eta Carinae</title>

<div> 关键词: Eta Carinae, spectrum, evolution, circumstellar ejecta, ionization
总结: 
Eta Carinae (η Car)自1900年以来，其光度和光谱发生了变化，可能是由于中心双星系统的演化或周围射流物质的变化。在1940年代出现的亮度跳跃与窄禁闭发射线的出现可能是由于周围射流物质的清除和电离。之后的40年间，亮度变化缓慢。1990年代早期，被解释为中心双星向Weigelt clumps的光线通道中消散的限制线发射增加导致的。而到了2000年，中心恒星核心亮度增加迅速，但Homunculus没有明显变化。到2018年，从（η Car）到我们的LOS中的单电离金属发生了数百次窄线吸收的现象消失，这可能是由于金属的电离增加造成的。这三次事件的解释是Homunculus附近的周围射流物质的耗散。在过去的四十年中，Homunculus和主要的星风保持稳定，这表明我们方向上的周围射流物质已经被清除。 <div>
Changes in the flux and spectrum of Eta Carinae (η Car) since 1900 have been attributed to the evolution of the central binary by some. Others suggest evolution in the occulting ejecta. The brightness jump in the 1940s, which coincided with the appearance of narrow forbidden emission lines, may have been caused by the clearing and ionization of intervening circumstellar ejecta. The brightening changed at a slower pace up through 40 yr later. Here we continue earlier studies focused on the long-term, showing that the forbidden line emission increased in the early 1990s with no noticeable increase in the brightness of the Homunculus. We interpret that the increase in narrow-line emission is due to decreased extinction in the line of sight (LOS) from the central binary to the Weigelt clumps. In 2000, the central stellar core increased in brightness at a faster rate without associated changes in the Homunculus. By 2018, hundreds of narrow-line absorptions from singly ionized metals in our LOS from (η Car) disappeared, thought to be caused by increased ionization of metals. These three events (1990, 2000, and 2018) are explained by the dissipation of circumstellar material within the Homunculus close to the binary. Combining these changes with the steadiness of the Homunculus and the primary winds over the past four decades indicates that circumstellar ejecta in our direction have been cleared.

<br />
本文通过三维磁流体动力学模拟揭示了磁场对通过丝状物质碎裂形成的分子云核角动量演化的影响。研究发现，在弱和强磁场情况下，质量为1太阳质量的情况下，角动量分别减少了30%和50%。通过分析在流体元素上施加的扭矩，确定了在强磁场情况下，磁张力是质量尺度≲3太阳质量时角动量转移的主要过程。我们还发现，核的角动量的各向异性转移由于强磁场的存在只会改变核的角动量约2倍。研究还表明，旋转轴和磁场之间的角度分布在第一个核形成之前甚至没有明显的对齐。我们的结果还表明，核的角动量的多样性来源于初始湍流速度场的相位差异。这种多样性可能有助于最近观测到的原行星盘的尺寸和其他性质的多样性。 
<br /><br />总结: <br />磁场对分子云核角动量的影响进行了研究，发现在强磁场条件下，角动量减小约50%。同时分析了磁力对角动量转移的影响，指出磁张力是影响角动量转移的主要过程。研究结果还发现旋转轴和磁场之间的角度分布并不强烈对齐，并且核的角动量多样性来源于初始湍流速度场的相位差异。 <div>
The angular momentum of molecular cloud cores plays a key role in the star formation process. However, the evolution of the angular momentum of molecular cloud cores formed in magnetized molecular filaments is still unclear. In this paper, we perform 3D magnetohydrodynamics simulations to reveal the effect of the magnetic field on the evolution of the angular momentum of molecular cloud cores formed through filament fragmentation. As a result, we find that the angular momentum decreases by 30% and 50% at the mass scale of 1 M⊙ in the case of weak and strong magnetic field, respectively. By analyzing the torques exerted on fluid elements, we identify the magnetic tension as the dominant process for angular momentum transfer for mass scales ≲3 M⊙ for the strong magnetic field case. This critical mass scale can be understood semianalytically as the timescale of magnetic braking. We show that the anisotropy of the angular momentum transfer due to the presence of a strong magnetic field changes the resultant angular momentum of the core only by a factor of 2. We also find that the distribution of the angle between the rotation axis and the magnetic field does not show strong alignment even just before the first core formation. Our results also indicate that the variety of the angular momentum of the cores is inherited from the difference in the phase of the initial turbulent velocity field. The variety could contribute to the diversity in size and other properties of protoplanetary disks recently reported by observations.

<div> 太阳，CME， Solar Orbiter，BepiColombo， Parker Solar Probe
总结: 2022年2月15日，科学家观测到了一次令人印象深刻的太阳色球丝发射事件，该事件与一个快速的日冕物质抛射（CME）有关，其速度约为2200km/s。此CME指向BepiColombo和Parker Solar Probe，这两个探测器在CME驱动的冲击波到达时的纬度相差2°，经度相差4°，径向距离相差0.03天文单位。两个探测器测得的主要CME相关结构显示一些明显差异，增加了对整体CME结构的理解的挑战。需要通过距离较近的探测器星座来研究太阳瞬变现象。 <div>
On 2022 February 15, an impressive filament eruption was observed off the solar eastern limb from three remote-sensing viewpoints, namely, Earth, STEREO-A, and Solar Orbiter. In addition to representing the most-distant observed filament at extreme ultraviolet wavelengths—captured by Solar Orbiter's field of view extending to above 6 R⊙—this event was also associated with the release of a fast (∼2200 km s−1) coronal mass ejection (CME) that was directed toward BepiColombo and Parker Solar Probe. These two probes were separated by 2° in latitude, 4° in longitude, and 0.03 au in radial distance around the time of the CME-driven shock arrival in situ. The relative proximity of the two probes to each other and the Sun (∼0.35 au) allows us to study the mesoscale structure of CMEs at Mercury's orbit for the first time. We analyze similarities and differences in the main CME-related structures measured at the two locations, namely, the interplanetary shock, the sheath region, and the magnetic ejecta. We find that, despite the separation between the two spacecraft being well within the typical uncertainties associated with determination of CME geometric parameters from remote-sensing observations, the two sets of in situ measurements display some profound differences that make understanding the overall 3D CME structure particularly challenging. Finally, we discuss our findings within the context of space weather at Mercury's distance and in terms of the need to investigate solar transients via spacecraft constellations with small separations, which has been gaining significant attention during recent years.

More than 36 yr have passed since the discovery of the infrared excess from circumstellar dust orbiting the white dwarf G29-38, which at 17.5 pc it is the nearest and brightest of its class. The precise morphology of the orbiting dust remains only marginally constrained by existing data, subject to model-dependent inferences, and thus fundamental questions of its dynamical origin and evolution persist. This study presents a means to constrain the geometric distribution of the emitting dust using stellar pulsations measured at optical wavelengths as a variable illumination source of the dust, which reradiates primarily in the infrared. By combining optical photometry from the Whole Earth Telescope with 0.7–2.5 μm spectroscopy obtained with SpeX at NASA’s Infrared Telescope Facility, we detect luminosity variations at all observed wavelengths, with variations at most wavelengths corresponding to the behavior of the pulsating stellar photosphere, but toward the longest wavelengths the light curves probe the corresponding time variability of the circumstellar dust. In addition to developing methodology, we find the pulsation amplitudes decrease with increasing wavelength for principal pulsation modes, yet increase beyond ≈2 μm for nonlinear combination frequencies. We interpret these results as combination modes derived from the principal modes of identical ℓ values and discuss the implications for the morphology of the warm dust. We also draw attention to some discrepancies between our findings and theoretical expectations for the results of the nonlinearity imposed by the surface convection zone on mode–mode interactions and on the behavior of the first harmonic of the highest-amplitude pulsation mode.

The radiation mechanism (thermal photosphere or magnetic synchrotron) and the progenitor of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are under hot debate. Recently discovered, the prompt long-duration (∼10 s, normally from the collapse of massive stars) property of GRB 211211A strongly conflicts with its association with a kilonova (normally from the merger of two compact objects, NS–NS, NS–BH, or NS–WD, duration ≲2 s). In this paper, we find that the probability photosphere model with a structured jet can satisfactorily explain this peculiar long duration, through the duration stretching effect (∼3 times) on the intrinsic longer (∼3 s) duration of an NS–BH merger, the observed empirical 2SBPL spectrum (with soft low-energy index α of ∼−1), and its evolution. In addition, much evidence of the NS–BH merger origin is found, especially the good fit of the afterglow-subtracted optical−near-IR light curves by the significant thermal cocoon emission and the sole thermal “red” kilonova component. Finally, a convincing new explanation for the X-ray afterglow plateau is revealed.

AMS-02 on board the International Space Station provides precise measurements of cosmic rays (CR) near Earth, while Voyager measures CRs in the local interstellar medium, beyond the effects of solar modulation. Based on these data, we test and revise various CR propagation scenarios under standard assumptions: pure diffusion, diffusion with convection, diffusion with reacceleration, and diffusion with reacceleration and convection. We report on the scenarios’ performance against CR measurements, aiming to limit the number of model parameters as much as possible. For each scenario, we find parameters that are able to reproduce Voyager and AMS-02 data for the entire energy band for all the CR species tested. Above several GV, we observe a similar injection spectral index for He and C, with He harder than H. Some scenarios previously disfavored are now reconsidered. For example, contrary to usual assumptions, we find that the pure diffusion scenario does not need an upturn in the diffusion coefficient at low energy, while it needs the same number of low-energy breaks in the injection spectrum as diffusive-reacceleration scenarios. We show that scenarios differ in modeled spectra of one order of magnitude for positrons at ∼1 GeV and of a factor of 2 for antiprotons at several GV. The force-field approximation describes well the AMS-02 and Voyager spectra analyzed, except antiprotons. We confirm the ∼10 GeV excess in the antiproton spectrum for all scenarios. Also, for all scenarios, the resulting modulation should be stronger for positrons than for nuclei, with reacceleration models requiring much larger modulation.

<br />双中子星融合现在被认为是大量产生重元素的过程，但是否是唯一或主要的快速中子俘获核生成过程的地点尚不清楚。双中子星的发生率、延迟时间和银河环境将影响它们对太阳系和银河中元素丰度的总贡献。另外，双中子星融合的预期元素产量可能取决于融合参数本身，例如它们的恒星质量和半径，这在许多银河化学演化模型中尚未考虑。通过观察 Milky Way 中的双中子星系统样本的特征，我们预测了双中子星群体在融合时产生的预期核合成产物，并将其核合成特征与太阳系元素的重元素丰度模式进行了比较。我们发现，根据当前的模型，目前的双中子星群体更有利于产生较轻的 r-过程元素，而相对于太阳系来说产生了较轻的元素。这种不一致可能意味着存在额外的重元素产生地点或者一个与目前观察到的双中子星群体相差很大的群体。 <br /><br />总结:双中子星融合是重元素产生的重要过程，但它们对于重元素丰度的贡献可能被低估。当前的模型显示，双中子星更有可能产生轻型 r-过程元素，而相对于太阳系来说产生了较少的重元素。这可能意味着存在其他产生重元素的地点或者目前观察到的双中子星群体有所不同。 <div>
While it is now known that the mergers of double neutron star binary systems (NSMs) are copious producers of heavy elements, there remains much speculation about whether they are the sole or even principal site of rapid neutron-capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis, one of the primary ways in which heavy elements are produced. The occurrence rates, delay times, and galactic environments of NSMs hold sway over estimating their total contribution to the elemental abundances in the solar system and the Galaxy. Furthermore, the expected elemental yields of NSMs may depend on the merger parameters themselves—such as their stellar masses and radii—which are not currently considered in many galactic chemical evolution models. Using the characteristics of the observed sample of double neutron star (DNS) systems in the Milky Way as a guide, we predict the expected nucleosynthetic yields that a population of DNSs would produce upon merger, and we compare that nucleosynthetic signature to the heavy-element abundance pattern of solar system elements. We find that with our current models, the present DNS population favors the production of lighter r-process elements, while underproducing the heaviest elements relative to the solar system. This inconsistency could imply an additional site for the heaviest elements or a population of DNSs much different from that observed today.

总结: 
DESI早期数据释放，使用SV3数据对z=0.1到0.3的HOD进行建模，其中包括CiC测量。使用galtab软件包对HOD模型进行快速精确的CiC预测，加速并提高了HOD参数的约束。通过HOD拟合，对特征暗物质质量和组装偏差进行了约束，并提供了各个阈值样本的特征暗物质质量、组装偏差等参数的数据。未来DESI数据预计会进一步缩小这些约束范围，因为数据范围将是SV3的100倍。 <div>
We explore the galaxy-halo connection information that is available in low-redshift samples from the early data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We model the halo occupation distribution (HOD) from z = 0.1 to 0.3 using Survey Validation 3 (SV3; a.k.a., the One-Percent Survey) data of the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey. In addition to more commonly used metrics, we incorporate counts-in-cylinders (CiC) measurements, which drastically tighten HOD constraints. Our analysis is aided by the Python package, galtab, which enables the rapid, precise prediction of CiC for any HOD model available in halotools. This methodology allows our Markov chains to converge with much fewer trial points, and enables even more drastic speedups due to its GPU portability. Our HOD fits constrain characteristic halo masses tightly and provide statistical evidence for assembly bias, especially at lower luminosity thresholds: the HOD of central galaxies in z ∼ 0.15 samples with limiting absolute magnitude Mr < −20.0 and Mr < −20.5 samples is positively correlated with halo concentration with a significance of 99.9% and 99.5%, respectively. Our models also favor positive central assembly bias for the brighter Mr < −21.0 sample at z ∼ 0.25 (94.8% significance), but there is no significant evidence for assembly bias with the same luminosity threshold at z ∼ 0.15. We provide our constraints for each threshold sample’s characteristic halo masses, assembly bias, and other HOD parameters. These constraints are expected to be significantly tightened with future DESI data, which will span an area 100 times larger than that of SV3.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been proposed as one of the promising sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), but observational evidence is still lacking. The nearby brightest of all time GRB 221009A, a once in 1000 yr event, is able to accelerate protons to ∼103 EeV, and then generate extremly energetic neutrons via the photomeson production interaction. Protons arriving at the Milky Way are dominated by neutron-decay-induced protons. The intergalactic magnetic fields would not yield a sizable delay of the ≥10 EeV cosmic rays if its strength is ≲10−13 G, while Galactic magnetic fields would cause a significant time delay. We predict that a UHECR burst from GRB 221009A would be detectable by the Pierre Auger Observatory and the TA×4, within ∼10 yr. The detection of such a UHECR outburst will provide the direct evidence for UHECR acceleration in GRBs.

<div> 关键词: 超新星、恒星演化、密集星周介质、双星、CSM
总结:
超新星观测表明部分大质量恒星在核心崩塌时存在密集的星周介质。本研究使用MESA进行大质量恒星的双星演化模拟，并通过PLUTO进行流体动力学模拟，探讨了双星演化对星周介质形成的影响。研究发现，在双星系统中，质量传递率可能在Roche波效应开始时增加，与爆炸前CSM的结构有关。此外，不同轨道周期的双星系统会形成不同密度结构的CSM，包括壳状和悬崖状结构。这些特征结构的长度尺度约为10^17厘米，若CSM速度较慢（约10 km/s），长期超新星观测可能揭示这些结构。研究结果强调了双星相互作用在再现CSM结构多样性方面的重要性。 <div>
Recent observations of supernovae (SNe) have indicated that a fraction of massive stars possess dense circumstellar medium (CSM) at the moment of their core collapses. They suggest the presence of additional activities of the SN progenitor driving the enhancement of the mass-loss rate, and some physical processes attributing to a single star’s activities have been considered. In this study, we carry out binary evolutionary simulations of massive stars by MESA and investigate effects on the subsequent CSM formation through hydrodynamical simulations by PLUTO. We show that the mass transfer rate in a binary can increase at the beginning of the Roche lobe overflow, and this enhancement would be associated with the structure of the CSM before the explosion. We also illustrate that, depending on the orbital period of the binary, the density structure of the CSM can have a diverse distribution, including shell-like and cliff-like structures. These characteristic structures appear within the length scale of ∼1017 cm and could be traced by long-term observations of SNe, if the slow velocity of the CSM is assumed (∼10 km s−1). Our results highlight the importance of binary interaction in the aspect of reproducing the diversity of the CSM configuration.

线偏振ALMA观测显示了Orion Molecular Cloud 3区域内七个恒星形成源的尘埃盘状结构和CO流的特征。尘埃盘的直径从16到97天文单位不等，其中一些源的极化强度占据了整个Stokes I峰值的10%至20%。其中一些源的极化方向与尘埃盘的短轴对齐，而一些源的极化强度出现了向盘的近侧移动，支持了极化辐射源于自相散射的观点。文章还对极化辐射的来源进行了讨论，包括自相散射和磁场对尘埃排列的影响。 <div>
We present the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of linearly polarized 1.1 mm continuum emission at ∼0.″14 (55 au) resolution and CO (J = 2−1) emission at ∼1.″5 (590 au) resolution toward one prestellar (MMS 4), four Class 0 (MMS 1, MMS 3, MMS 5, and MMS 6), one Class I (MMS 7), and one flat-spectrum (MMS 2) sources in the Orion Molecular Cloud 3 region. The dust disk-like structures and clear CO outflows are detected toward all sources except for MMS 4. The diameters of these disk-like structures, ranging from 16 to 97 au, are estimated based on the deconvolved full width half maximum (FWHM) values obtained from the multi-Gaussian fitting. Polarized emissions are detected toward MMS 2, MMS 5, MMS 6, and MMS 7, while no polarized emission is detected toward MMS 1, MMS 3, and MMS 4. MMS 2, MMS 5, and MMS 7 show organized polarization vectors aligned with the minor axes of the disk-like structures, with mean polarization fractions ranging from 0.6% to 1.2%. The strongest millimeter source, MMS 6, exhibits complex polarization orientations and a remarkably high polarization fraction of ∼10% around the Stokes I peak, and 15%–20% on the arm-like structure, as reported by Takahashi et al. (2019). The origins of the polarized emission, such as self-scattering and dust alignment due to the magnetic field or radiative torque, are discussed for individual sources. Some disk-like sources exhibit a polarized intensity peak shift toward the nearside of the disk, which supports that the polarized emission originates from self-scattering.

<div> 黑洞，星系，分子气体，星形成，ALMA<br />
总结:<br />
Henize 2–10 是一个矮星爆发星系，其中含有一个大约10^6太阳质量的黑洞，它正在驱动电离流，并在星系中心的约100光年范围内触发星形成。研究使用ALMA进行了射电和分子谱线观测，发现黑洞的谱能量分布在1.4至340 GHz范围内由同步辐射主导。分析了分子气体数据，并确定了黑洞周围的分子气体结构，其物理尺度约为130光年×30光年，分子气体质量约为10^6太阳质量。值得注意的是，黑洞的位置与分子气体的峰值强度有显著偏移，这可能解释了为什么黑洞的Eddington比例非常低。对CO J = 3–2和J = 1–0的空间分辨率线比的分析表明，黑洞附近的CO气体受到了极高的激发，特别是在黑洞喷流和触发星形成区域的交界处。这暗示着冷的分子气体受到了黑洞的双极喷流的冲击，支持了积极的黑洞反馈的观点。 <div>
Henize 2–10 is a dwarf starburst galaxy hosting a ∼106M⊙ black hole (BH) that is driving an ionized outflow and triggering star formation within the central ∼100 pc of the galaxy. Here, we present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array continuum observations from 99 to 340 GHz, as well as spectral line observations of the molecules CO (1–0, 3–2), HCN (1–0, 3–2), and HCO+ (1–0, 3–2), with a focus on the BH and its vicinity. Incorporating centimeter-wave radio measurements from the literature, we show that the spectral energy distribution of the BH is dominated by synchrotron emission from 1.4 to 340 GHz, with a spectral index of α ≈ − 0.5. We analyze the spectral line data and identify an elongated molecular gas structure around the BH with a velocity distinct from the surrounding regions. The physical extent of this molecular gas structure is ≈130 pc × 30 pc and the molecular gas mass is ∼106M⊙. Despite an abundance of molecular gas in this general region, the position of the BH is significantly offset from the peak intensity, which may explain why the BH is radiating at a very low Eddington ratio. Our analysis of the spatially resolved line ratio between CO J = 3–2 and J = 1–0 implies that the CO gas in the vicinity of the BH is highly excited, particularly at the interface between the BH outflow and the regions of triggered star formation. This suggests that the cold molecular gas is being shocked by the bipolar outflow from the BH, supporting the case for positive BH feedback.

这篇文章总结了对与太阳光度相似的恒星利用自相关函数（ACF）技术推导出的旋转周期的困难。研究了影响这些测量精度的各种因素，包括观测窗口和噪声的影响、恒星活动和倾斜、光谱通带以及相邻分段的分离规范化。验证了faculae造成的光度变化非常周期性，但星斑是太阳类星上差异变化的主要来源。量化了使类太阳光变周期足够强以进行可靠测量的faculae相对贡献的强度，以及使纯星斑光变周期足够强的星斑寿命需要多长。通常来说，观测窗口越长，即使没有faculae存在，ACF测量也更加准确。由于增强了faculae相对贡献，观测中倾斜度中等的恒星、活动极小期间的观测和/或通过更蓝的通带观测均会加强光变曲线的周期性。我们还在太阳类恒星的宽带光度中寻找了faculae的其他表现形式，并得出结论：在没有绝对光通量测量或限制为更短波长的通带时，差分光变曲线对于faculae没有信息量。<br /><br />总结: 光变特性的测量利用ACF技术困难，主要受到恒星活动、观测窗口和恒星倾斜等因素影响。Faculae引起的光度变化非常周期性，而星斑是主要光变源。观测窗口越长，测量越准确。通过增强faculae相对贡献、恒星倾斜度中等的观测和更蓝的通带观测可以加强光变曲线的周期性。在宽带光度中差分光变曲线对于faculae没有信息量。 <div>
Rotational periods derived from autocorrelation function (ACF) techniques on stars photometrically similar to the Sun in Kepler data have proven difficult to reliably determine. We investigate various instrumental and astrophysical factors affecting the accuracy of these measurements, including the effects of observational windows and noise, stellar activity and inclination, spectral passbands, and the separate normalization of contiguous segments. We validate that the flux variations due to faculae are very periodic, but starspots are the dominant source of bolometric and visible differential variability in Sun-like stars on rotational timescales. We quantify how much stronger the relative contribution of faculae would have to be to render Sun-like light curves periodic enough to reliably measure with autocorrelation methods. We also quantify how long starspot lifetimes need to be to render pure spot light curves periodic enough. In general, longer observational windows yield more accurate ACF measurements, even when faculae are not present. Due to the enhancement of the relative contribution of faculae, observing stars with intermediate inclinations, during activity minima, and/or through bluer passbands has the effect of strengthening the periodicity of the light curve. We search for other manifestations of faculae in broadband photometry of Sun-like stars and conclude that without absolute flux measurements or restriction to shorter-wavelength passbands, differential light curves are uninformative about faculae.

Galactic compact binaries with orbital periods shorter than a few hours emit detectable gravitational waves (GWs) at low frequencies. Their GW signals can be detected with the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Crucially, they may be useful in the early months of the mission operation in helping to validate LISA's performance in comparison to prelaunch expectations. We present an updated list of 55 candidate LISA-detectable binaries with measured properties, for which we derive distances based on Gaia Data Release 3 astrometry. Based on the known properties from electromagnetic observations, we predict the LISA detectability after 1, 3, 6, and 48 months using Bayesian analysis methods. We distinguish between verification and detectable binaries as being detectable after 3 and 48 months, respectively. We find 18 verification binaries and 22 detectable sources, which triples the number of known LISA binaries over the last few years. These include detached double white dwarfs, AM CVn binaries, one ultracompact X-ray binary, and two hot subdwarf binaries. We find that across this sample the GW amplitude is expected to be measured to ≈10% on average, while the inclination is expected to be determined with ≈15° precision. For detectable binaries, these average errors increase to ≈50% and ≈40°, respectively.

<div> radio supernovae, inhomogeneities, deduced source properties, volume filling factor, synchrotron emission

总结:<br /><br />本文讨论了空间未解析源中不均匀性的存在，这使得很难确定源的性质。文章展示了如何利用不符合均匀模型的观察特征来推断射电超新星中不均匀性的性质。此外，放射冷却的观察结果可能会受到不均匀性的严重影响。文章指出，观测到的冷却频率的值对推断源的性质非常敏感；即使是下限通常也有助于限制其特征。文章认为SN 2003L中的主要同步辐射发射区具有较小的体积填充因子，可能低至几个百分点。相反，SN 2002ap中的非均匀性偏差显著较小。总体上，类型Ib/c射电超新星的观测性质表明个体源的体积填充因子随时间保持相当恒定，但在射电频率上达到峰值的源具有较低的填充因子。SN 2003L和SN 2002ap中主同步辐射组分的条件与相对论电子和磁场之间的能量均衡一致。 <div>
The presence of inhomogeneities in a spatially unresolved source is often hard to establish. This limits the accuracy with which the source properties can be determined. It is shown how observed features not expected for a homogeneous model can be used to infer the properties of the inhomogeneities in radio supernovae. Furthermore, the observed consequences of radiative cooling can be seriously affected by inhomogeneities. It is shown that the deduced source properties are very sensitive to the observed value of the cooling frequency; even a lower limit is often useful to constrain its characteristics. It is argued that the main synchrotron emission region in SN 2003L has a small volume filling factor, possibly as low as a few percent. On the contrary, deviations from homogeneity are substantially smaller in SN 2002ap. The observed properties of Type Ib/c radio supernovae in general indicate the volume filling factor to remain rather constant with time for individual sources, but those peaking later at radio frequencies have lower filling factors. The conditions in the main synchrotron component in both SN 2003L and SN 2002ap are consistent with equipartition of energy between relativistic electrons and magnetic fields.

GWSkyNet-Multi是一个用于对LIGO和Virgo观测所检测到的候选引力波事件进行分类的机器学习模型。该模型利用低延迟的公开警报中发布的有限信息，生成预测分数，指示事件是否是两个黑洞的合并、涉及中子星的合并，或者是非天体故障。然而，人们对于模型如何利用有限的信息进行预测并不了解。通过对模型和其输入进行系统性干扰，我们发现模型学习用于区分源的基本特征和相关性。我们发现，二维天空图的定位区域和计算的一致性与不一致性贝叶斯因子被用作强有力的预测器，用于区分真实事件和故障。而估计的源距离进一步用于区分二进制黑洞合并和涉及中子星的合并。我们利用这些发现来展示GWSkyNet-Multi在LVK的第三次观测运行中错误分类的事件具有不同的天空区域、一致性因子和距离值，这些影响了预测并解释了这些误分类。这些结果有助于识别模型的局限性，并为进一步优化提供了潜在的途径。 <br /><br />总结: GWSkyNet-Multi是一个用于分类引力波事件的深度学习模型，借助有限信息进行预测，发现了特定的天空区域、一致性因子和距离值对于区分不同类型的事件具有重要作用，同时揭示了模型的局限性并提出了进一步优化的可能路径。 <div>
GWSkyNet-Multi is a machine learning model developed for the classification of candidate gravitational-wave events detected by the LIGO and Virgo observatories. The model uses limited information released in the low-latency Open Public Alerts to produce prediction scores indicating whether an event is a merger of two black holes (BHs), a merger involving a neutron star (NS), or a non-astrophysical glitch. This facilitates time-sensitive decisions about whether to perform electromagnetic follow-up of candidate events during LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observing runs. However, it is not well understood how the model is leveraging the limited information available to make its predictions. As a deep learning neural network, the inner workings of the model can be difficult to interpret, impacting our trust in its validity and robustness. We tackle this issue by systematically perturbing the model and its inputs to explain what underlying features and correlations it has learned for distinguishing the sources. We show that the localization area of the 2D sky maps and the computed coherence versus incoherence Bayes factors are used as strong predictors for distinguishing between real events and glitches. The estimated distance to the source is further used to discriminate between binary BH mergers and mergers involving NSs. We leverage these findings to show that events misclassified by GWSkyNet-Multi in LVK’s third observing run have distinct sky areas, coherence factors, and distance values that influence the predictions and explain these misclassifications. The results help identify the model’s limitations and inform potential avenues for further optimization.

We study the stellar population properties of 182 spectroscopically confirmed (MUSE/VLT) Lyα emitters (LAEs) and 450 photometrically selected Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at z = 2.8–6.7 in the Hubble Extreme Deep Field. Leveraging the combined power of Hubble Space Telescope and JWST NIRCam and MIRI observations, we analyze their rest-frame UV-through-near-IR spectral energy distributions, with MIRI playing a crucial role in robustly assessing the LAEs’ stellar masses and ages. Our LAEs are low-mass objects with little or no dust extinction (E(B − V) ≃ 0.1) and a blue UV continuum slope (β ≃ −2.2). While 75% of our LAEs are young (<100 Myr), the remaining 25% have significantly older stellar populations (≥100 Myr). These old LAEs are statistically more massive, less extinct, and have lower specific star formation rate than young LAEs. Besides, they populate the plane of M⋆ versus star formation rate along the main sequence of star-forming galaxies, while young LAEs populate the starburst region. The comparison between the LAEs’ properties and those of a stellar-mass-matched sample of LBGs shows no statistical difference between these objects, except for the LBGs’ redder UV continuum slope and marginally larger E(B − V) values. Interestingly, 48% of the LBGs have ages <10 Myr and are classified as starbursts, but lack detectable Lyα emission. This is likely due to H i resonant scattering and/or dust-selective extinction. Overall, we find that JWST observations are crucial in determining the properties of LAEs and shedding light on their comparison with LBGs.

Directly observing exoplanets with coronagraphs is impeded by the presence of speckles from aberrations in the optical path, which can be mitigated in hardware with wave front control, as well as in post-processing. This work explores using an instrument model in post-processing to separate astrophysical signals from residual aberrations in coronagraphic data. The effect of wave front error (WFE) on the coronagraphic intensity consists of a linear contribution and a quadratic contribution. When either of the terms is much larger than the other, the instrument response can be approximated by a transfer matrix mapping WFE to detector plane intensity. From this transfer matrix, a useful projection onto instrumental modes that removes the dominant error modes can be derived. We apply this approach to synthetically generated Roman Space Telescope hybrid Lyot coronagraph data to extract “robust observables,” which can be used instead of raw data for applications such as detection testing. The projection improves planet flux ratio detection limits by about 28% in the linear regime and by over a factor of 2 in the quadratic regime, illustrating that robust observables can increase sensitivity to astrophysical signals and improve the scientific yield from coronagraphic data. While this approach does not require additional information such as observations of reference stars or modulations of a deformable mirror, it can and should be combined with these other techniques, acting as a model-informed prior in an overall post-processing strategy.

The stellar stream connected to the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy is the most massive tidal stream that has been mapped in the Galaxy, and is the dominant contributor to the outer stellar halo of the Milky Way (MW). We present metallicity maps of the Sgr stream, using 34,240 red giant branch stars with inferred metallicities from Gaia BP/RP spectra. This sample is larger than previous samples of Sgr stream members with chemical abundances by an order of magnitude. We measure metallicity gradients with respect to Sgr stream coordinates (Λ, B), and highlight the gradient in metallicity with respect to stream latitude coordinate B, which has not been observed before. Including the core, we find ∇[M/H] = −2.48 ± 0.08 × 10−2 dex deg−1 above the stream track (B > B0, where B0 = 1.5° is the latitude of the Sgr remnant) and ∇[M/H] = −2.02 ± 0.08 × 10−2 dex deg−1 below the stream track (B < B0). By painting metallicity gradients onto a tailored N-body simulation of the Sgr stream, we find that the observed metallicities in the stream are consistent with an initial radial metallicity gradient in the Sgr dwarf galaxy of ∼−0.1 to −0.2 dex kpc−1, well within the range of observed metallicity gradients in Local Group dwarf galaxies. Our results provide novel observational constraints for the internal structure of the dwarf galaxy progenitor of the Sgr stream. Leveraging new large data sets in conjunction with tailored simulations, we can connect the present-day properties of disrupted dwarfs in the MW to their initial conditions.

总结: 本研究利用James Webb太空望远镜的MRS仪器对大麦哲伦星云（LMC）N79区域的11个年轻恒星对象（YSOs）进行了光谱观测。在N79区域的三个巨大分子云中，我们发现了具有特殊特征的YSOs，包括完整或几乎完整的4.9–27.9μm波段的发射和吸收线，其中年轻最小的YSO Y3显示出明显的冰吸收特征，并且其中心离子化YSO Y4具有大量的发射线。此外，我们还首次在中红外观测到了在星团中形成的高质量原恒星，而这些星团位于LMC这样的外星系环境中。根据H i (7-6)线的光度，我们得出四个YSOs的质量吸积率在1.22 × 10−4–1.89 × 10−2M⊙ yr−1之间。这项研究有助于我们更深入地了解外星系中的星际物质的形成和演化过程。<br /><br /> <div>
In this work, we present spectra of 11 young stellar objects (YSOs) taken with the Mid-Infrared Instrument / Medium Resolution Spectroscopy (MRS) instrument on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The YSOs are located in the N79 region of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), an active star-forming region with hundreds of Spitzer- and Herschel-identified YSOs and host to super star cluster (SSC) candidate H72.97-69.39. The three giant molecular clouds in N79 (East, West, and South) have varying star formation rates and stellar populations. MRS follow-up observations of four Spitzer-identified YSOs in N79 East, West, and South have revealed that what seemed to be a single, massive YSO is actually a cluster of YSOs. We discuss the emission and absorption lines of six YSOs that have complete or almost-complete spectral coverage from 4.9–27.9 μm. YSO Y3, located in N79 East, is the youngest source in this study and likely to be less than 10,000 yr old, as inferred from the prominent CH4, NH3, CH3OH, CH3OCHO, and CO2 ice absorption features. The most luminous source is the central ionizing YSO of SSC H72.97-69.39, Y4, which has dozens of fine-structure and H2 emission lines. Unlike the other YSOs in this work, Y4 has no polyaromatic hydrocarbon emission lines, due to the intense ionizing radiation destroying these large carbon-chain molecules. The mass accretion rates based on the H i (7-6) line luminosities of YSOs Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y9 range between 1.22 × 10−4–1.89 × 10−2M⊙ yr−1. For the first time in the mid-infrared, we are able to resolve individual high-mass protostars forming in small clusters in an extragalactic environment like the LMC.

<div> AGNs, Lockman Hole field, spectroscopic sample, [Ne v]λ3426 emission line, MIR SEDs  
总结: 该研究使用24μm选取的光谱样本，在Lockman Hole区域发现了4035个光谱。研究旨在识别活动星系核（AGNs）并确定在这个中红外选择样本中的占比。通过用[Ne v]λ3426发射线进行光谱识别，发现样本中有887个（约22%）AGNs。通过堆叠分析发现在MIR楔形选取的AGN候选者中，堆叠光谱仍然显示出明显的[Ne v]λ3426发射信号。而在楔形之外的非AGN候选者中则没有清晰的[Ne v]λ3426信号。研究开发了一种方法，利用静止系L12/L1.6对L4.5/L1.6图表，将AGN和星形成对MIR SEDs的贡献分离出来。他们发现AGN在12μm处的纯净光度与星形成率呈正相关，表明AGNs和宿主星系可能存在共同的气体供应，说明了观测到的相关性来自于不同红移范围内的种群特性的变化。 <div>
We present a 24 μm-selected spectroscopic sample z > 0.13 (median 〈z〉 = 0.41) in the Lockman Hole field, consisting of 4035 spectra. Our aim is to identify active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and determine their fraction in this mid-infrared-selected sample. In this work, we use the [Ne v]λ3426 emission line to spectroscopically identify AGNs. Combined with broad-line Type I AGNs selected in our previous study, our sample consists of 887 (∼22%) spectroscopically confirmed AGNs. We perform a stacking analysis on the remaining spectra and find that in various mid-infrared (MIR) wedge-selected AGN candidates, the stacked spectra still show significant [Ne v]λ3426 emission. In contrast, no clear [Ne v]λ3426 signal is detected in non-AGN candidates falling outside the wedges. Assuming a range of AGN MIR spectral energy distribution (SED) slope of −0.3 <α < 0.7, and an average star-forming relation derived from 65 star-forming templates, we develop a robust method to separate the AGN and star-forming contributions to the MIR SEDs using the rest-frame L12/L1.6 versus L4.5/L1.6 diagram. We separate the objects into bins of L12 and find that the AGN fraction increases with increasing L12. We also find that the stacked [Ne v]λ3426 strength scales with L12. The pure AGN luminosity at 12 μm exhibits a positive correlation with the star formation rates, indicating possible coevolution and common gas supply between the AGNs and their host galaxies. Varying population properties across the redshift range explored contribute to the observed correlation.

MOHEGs是Faranoff–Riley I/II类型的射电星系，富含分子氢，但星形成活动较低。通过H i 21 cm吸收线，对红移<0.2的中性氢气相关的射电MOHEGs进行研究，发现70%的星系中存在中性氢，距离相邻星系8-120 kpc。这些星系相比相似红移的合并星系，H i气体稀缺。发现N(H i)、NH与星系属性之间关联不强，表明原子气体对星形成可能不重要。总氢气面密度与星形成面密度的关系偏离标准的Kennicutt-Schmidt定律。研究强调了H i研究的重要性，并为解释这些星系的特性提供了见解。未来，使用下一代射电望远镜进行的H i 21 cm吸收线调查，比如Square Kilometre Array和先导仪器，可能会为这些关联提供更好的约束。
<br />总结: 本研究基于H i 21 cm吸收线对射电MOHEGs进行了中性氢气相关性的研究，发现了一些重要发现，包括70%的星系存在中性氢，这些星系中的H i气体稀缺，N(H i)、NH与星系属性之间关联不强，以及总氢气面密度与星形成面密度的关系与Kennicutt-Schmidt定律不符。这些发现强调了H i研究的重要性，并具有重要的见解。未来，使用下一代射电望远镜进行的H i 21 cm吸收线调查可能会为这些关联提供更好的约束。 <div>
Empirical studies of cold gas content are essential for comprehending the star formation activities and evolution in galaxies. However, it is not straightforward to understand these processes because they depend on various physical properties of the interstellar medium. Massive Faranoff–Riley I/II type radio galaxies rich in molecular hydrogen with lower star formation activities are known as radio molecular hydrogen emission galaxies (MOHEGs). We present a study of neutral hydrogen-gas-associated radio MOHEGs at redshifts <0.2 probed via the H i 21 cm absorption line. Neutral hydrogen is detected in 70% of these galaxies, which are located at a distance of 8–120 kpc from the neighboring galaxies. These galaxies show a scarcity of H i gas as compared to merging galaxies at similar redshifts. We found no strong correlation between N(H i), NH, and the galaxy properties, regardless of whether the H i is assumed to be cold or warm, indicating that the atomic gas probably plays no important role in star formation. The relation between the total hydrogen gas surface density and the star formation surface density deviates from the standard Kennicutt–Schmidt law. Our study highlights the importance of H i studies and offers insights into the role of atomic and molecular hydrogen gas in explaining the properties of these galaxies. In the upcoming H i 21 cm absorption surveys with next-generation radio telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array and pathfinder instruments, it may be possible to provide better constraints for these correlations.

总结:<br /><br />
本文介绍了利用40 GHz通道的CLASS观测的CMB极化角尺度（ℓ < 30）特征的测量方法，并探讨了对再电离的光学深度的限制以及搜索通观宇宙膨胀的标志的重要性。通过对Atacama沙漠的优越条件和前端极化调制技术的稳定性，研究表明该通道的灵敏度高于卫星测量的类似频率。通过对漫射辐射的EE和BB谱的测量，对银河遮蔽的漫射辐射的漫射谱能量密度进行了空间方面的扩展。此外，还对ℓ < 125范围内的圆极化背景进行了上限测量，并给出了令人兴奋的可能性。这些结果为从地面恢复最大尺度的CMB极化建立了一种新标准，并展示了当包括更高灵敏度和更高频率的CLASS通道进行分析时的潜在机会。 <div>
Measurement of the largest angular scale (ℓ < 30) features of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization is a powerful way to constrain the optical depth to reionization and search for the signature of inflation through the detection of primordial B-modes. We present an analysis of maps covering 73.6% of the sky made from the 40 GHz channel of the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) from 2016 August to 2022 May. Taking advantage of the measurement stability enabled by front-end polarization modulation and excellent conditions from the Atacama Desert, we show this channel achieves higher sensitivity than the analogous frequencies from satellite measurements in the range 10 < ℓ < 100. Simulations show the CLASS linear (circular) polarization maps have a white noise level of . We measure the Galaxy-masked EE and BB spectra of diffuse synchrotron radiation and compare to space-based measurements at similar frequencies. In combination with external data, we expand measurements of the spatial variations of the synchrotron spectral energy density (SED) to include new sky regions and measure the diffuse SED in the harmonic domain. We place a new upper limit on a background of circular polarization in the range 5 < ℓ < 125 with the first bin showing Dℓ < 0.023 at 95% confidence. These results establish a new standard for recovery of the largest-scale CMB polarization from the ground and signal exciting possibilities when the higher sensitivity and higher-frequency CLASS channels are included in the analysis.

<title>Powerful Radio-loud Quasars Are Triggered by Galaxy Mergers in the Cosmic Bright Ages</title>

<div> AGN, radio-loud quasars, major galaxy mergers, black hole mass, Hubble Space Telescope
总结:
本研究测试了宇宙正午时期（1≲z≲2）强劲射电喷流AGN活动在大型星系合并中触发的假设。通过比较Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/IR观测到的z>1 3CR射电喧闹宽线类星体与三个配对的射电安静类星体对照样本，发现几乎所有的射电喧闹AGN都存在大型合并活动，而射电安静AGN中合并比例要低得多。这些结果表明大型星系合并是发射强大射电喷流的关键因素。另外，发现黑洞质量与宿主星系亮度之间存在紧密关联，与当地椭圆星系观察到的情况不一致。最后，指出很多射电喧闹类星体为蓝色，这一结果可能挑战了以星系合并为初始触发，红色类星体反馈后最终进入平静状态的"吹出"宇宙演化模型。 <div>
While supermassive black holes are ubiquitous features of galactic nuclei, only a small minority are observed during episodes of luminous accretion. The physical mechanism(s) driving the onset of fueling and ignition in these active galactic nuclei (AGN) are still largely unknown for many galaxies and AGN-selection criteria. Attention has focused on AGN triggering by means of major galaxy mergers gravitationally funneling gas toward the galactic center, with evidence both for and against this scenario. However, several recent studies have found that radio-loud AGN overwhelmingly reside in ongoing or recent major galaxy mergers. In this study, we test the hypothesis that major galaxy mergers are important triggers for radio-loud AGN activity in powerful quasars during cosmic noon (1 ≲ z ≲ 2). To this end, we compare Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/IR observations of the z > 1 3CR radio-loud broad-lined quasars to three matched radio-quiet quasar control samples. We find strong evidence for major-merger activity in nearly all radio-loud AGN, in contrast to the much lower merger fraction in the radio-quiet AGN. These results suggest major galaxy mergers are key ingredients in launching powerful radio jets. Given many of our radio-loud quasars are blue, our results present a possible challenge to the “blowout” paradigm of galaxy evolution models in which blue quasars are the quiescent end result following a period of red quasar feedback initiated by a galaxy merger. Finally, we find a tight correlation between black hole mass and host galaxy luminosity for these different high-redshift AGN samples that is inconsistent with those observed for local elliptical galaxies.

<div> Oort cloud, comet, disintegration, spectra, reflectivity
<br /><br />总结:
2020年3月起，C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS)彗星的核心开始解体。作者使用长缝光谱和Xinglong 2.16米望远镜获取了该彗星的气体和尘埃特性的多色频带图像。观测显示C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS)在光学波段出现了CN、C2、C3和NH2等强发射带，这些是典型的彗星光谱特征。使用Haser模型导出的CN、C2和C3的产量表明C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS)在A'Hearn分类下是一个“典型”的Oort云彗星，尽管其尘埃量较少。其尘埃散射反射率略呈红色，这可以通过多孔尘埃模型来解释。 <div>
C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS) is an Oort cloud comet with an orbital period of ∼5895 yr. Starting in 2020 March, its nucleus underwent disintegration. In order to investigate the gas and dust properties of C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS) during its disintegration, we obtained long-slit spectra at 3600–8700 Å and BVRI multiband images with the Xinglong 2.16 m Telescope in 2020 April. Our observations revealed that C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS) exhibited strong emission bands of CN, C2, C3, and NH2, which are superimposed on a dust-scattering continuum, typical of cometary spectra in the optical. The production rates of CN, C2, and C3 derived using the Haser model and the corresponding C2/CN and C3/CN ratios suggest that C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS) is a “typical” Oort cloud comet under the A’Hearn classification, although it appears less dusty, as revealed by the Afρ quantities. Its dust-scattering reflectivity is slightly red, with a gradient of ∼5% per 103Å. We model the reflectivity gradient in terms of porous dust and find that the red color is accounted for by porous dust.

<div> TESS, afterglows, GRBs, observational study, cadence
总结:<br /><br />该研究利用TESS对伽马射线暴的余辉进行了观测，在TESS的数据中检测到11个候选信号，其中3个被分类为高可能性的伽马射线暴余辉，5个被分类为暂定，其余被认为不太可能。研究使用afterglowpy软件对每个候选光变曲线进行了建模，得出爆发与余辉出现之间平均时间延迟为740±690秒的结果。该研究表明，TESS因其高观测频率和广阔的视场，在定位伽马射线暴方面具有巨大潜力，能够观测到之前光学望远镜无法达到的时间尺度上的余辉。 <div>
Gamma-ray bursts produce afterglows that can be observed across the electromagnetic spectrum and can provide insight into the nature of their progenitors. While most telescopes that observe afterglows are designed to rapidly react to trigger information, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) continuously monitors sections of the sky at cadences between 30 minutes and 200 s. This provides TESS with the capability of serendipitously observing the optical afterglow of GRBs. We conduct the first extensive search for afterglows of known GRBs in archival TESS data reduced with the TESSreduce package, and detect 11 candidate signals that are temporally coincident with reported burst times. We classify three of these as high-likelihood GRB afterglows previously unknown to have been detected by TESS, one of which has no other afterglow detection reported on the Gamma-ray Coordinates Network. We classify five candidates as tentative and the remainder as unlikely. Using the afterglowpy package, we model each of the candidate light curves with a Gaussian and a top-hat model to estimate burst parameters; we find that a mean time delay of 740 ± 690 s between the explosion and afterglow onset is required to perform these fits. The high cadence and large field of view make TESS a powerful instrument for localising GRBs, with the potential to observe afterglows in cases when no other backup photometry is possible, and at timescales previously unreachable by optical telescopes.

<div> 星系，微波辐射，MALATANG，亮度，恒星形成<br />总结:<br />本研究利用韩国VLBI网络进行了单天线观测，以探寻附近星系中的异常微波辐射。研究选择了来自James Clerk Maxwell望远镜的遗产调查项目“Mapping the dense molecular gas in the strongest star-forming galaxies”（MALATANG）中的目标星系。通过与其他数据的结合，研究了5个星系的无线电-红外谱能分布（SED），并在其中的NGC 2903星系中明显探测到了AME信号。而NGC 2146和M82星系中的AME信号则较弱。NGC 1068和Arp 299星系中未观测到明显的AME信号，研究给出了AME的上限。最拟合的SED显示出AME成分在频率更高且峰值流量更强的局部峰值，这暗示AME的起源可能是分子云或光解离区这样的密集环境，而非常见的暖中性/电离介质。此外，AME被发现更喜欢具有更高特定恒星形成速率的目标星系，而不是AGN宿主。因此，这可能暗示AGN对微尘来说是过于恶劣的环境。 <div>
We present the results of the single-dish observations using the Korean VLBI Network to search for anomalous microwave emission (AME) in nearby galaxies. The targets were selected from ‘Mapping the dense molecular gas in the strongest star-forming galaxies' (MALATANG), a legacy survey project of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. The MALATANG galaxies are good representatives of local galaxies with enhanced nuclear activity associated with star formation and/or active galactic nuclei (AGNs), providing IR-bright galaxy samples; thus, they are good candidates for AME hosts. Combining with ancillary data, we investigated the radio–IR spectral energy distribution (SED), while searching for AME signals in five galaxies. The AME in NGC 2903 was well detected at a significant confidence level, whereas that in NGC 2146 and M82 was marginal. NGC 1068 and Arp 299 indicated no significant hints, and we provide upper limits for the AME. The best-fit SED exhibited local peaks of the AME components at higher frequencies and with stronger peak fluxes than those in previous studies. This suggested that AME originates from denser environments such as molecular clouds or photodissociation regions rather than warm neutral/ionized medium as commonly suggested by previous studies. Further, our AME-detected targets were observed to exhibit higher specific star formation rates than the other extragalactic AME hosts. Furthermore, AME favored starburst galaxies among our sample rather than AGN hosts. Consequently, this might imply that AGNs are excessively harsh environments for tiny dust to survive.

扩展壳体的负速度可以归因于老超新星的气体，但膨胀壳体的推移对应物在哪里？通过λ-21厘米银河中性氢EBHIS调查的数据显示，接近的和远离的氢气壳体形成了复杂K的一部分。高蓝移速度来自于氢气进入低密度的星际空间环境。数据还显示远离的边缘的特征，表明了壳体的远离排放。如果做出壳体均匀且球对称的简化假设，那么爆炸约在3 × 105年前发生。动量p ∼ 7 × 104M⊙ km s−1，与近期模型估计的超新星演化相吻合。第三次盖亚数据发布识别的几个双星系统可能是复杂K中异常速度H i气体的超新星爆炸来源。通过几个带有中子星候选者的双星系统确定了讨论中H i特征的距离。 <br /><br />总结:这篇文章探讨了高速云的一个悬而未决的谜团，通过对观测数据的分析，发现了远离和接近壳体的特征，揭示了超新星爆炸可能是导致复杂K中异常速度氢气的原因，并通过多种观测数据和模型估计得出了有关爆炸发生的时间和动量的信息。 <div>
We address one of the lingering mysteries of high-velocity clouds: If the anomalous negative velocities are the result of the approaching gas from old supernovae, then where are the receding counterparts of the expanding shells? Data from the λ-21 cm Galactic neutral hydrogen EBHIS survey (Winkel et al.) show multiple signatures of the expanding shells. The near-side (approaching) H i shells form part of Complex K. The high blueshifted velocities result from the H i moving into the low-density environment of inter-arm space. The H i data also show a distinctive, bow-shaped feature, the signature of the far-side (receding) emission of an expanding shell. The low redshifted velocity results from the gas expanding into volumes of space with a higher density. If we make the simplifying assumptions that the expansion of the shells is uniform and spherically symmetric, then the explosions took place about ⪅3 × 105 yr ago. The momentum, p ∼ 7 × 104M⊙ km s−1, agrees with recent model estimates for supernova evolution. Supernova explosions attributed to the unseen companion in several binary systems identified by the Third Gaia Data Release may be responsible for anomalous-velocity H i gas in Complex K. Four binary star systems with neutron-star candidates are located at the edge of the Sagittarius spiral arm and used to determine the distance to the H i features discussed here.

Using data from ALFALFA, xGASS, H i-MaNGA, and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we identify a sample of 47 “red but H i-rich” (RR) galaxies with near-UV (NUV) − r > 5 and unusually high H i-to-stellar mass ratios. We compare the optical properties and local environments between the RR galaxies and a control sample of “red and H i-normal” (RN) galaxies that are matched in stellar mass and color. The two samples are similar in the optical properties typical of massive red (quenched) galaxies in the local Universe. The RR sample tends to be associated with slightly lower-density environments and has lower clustering amplitudes and smaller neighbor counts at scales from several hundred kiloparsecs to a few megaparsecs. The results are consistent with the RR galaxies being preferentially located at the center of low-mass halos, with a median halo mass ∼1012h−1M⊙ compared to ∼1012.5h−1M⊙ for the RN sample. This result is confirmed by the SDSS group catalog, which reveals a central fraction of 89% for the RR sample, compared to ∼60% for the RN sample. If assumed to follow the H i size–mass relation of normal galaxies, the RR galaxies have an average H i-to-optical radius ratio of RHI/R90 ∼ 4, four times the average ratio for the RN sample. We compare our RR sample with similar samples in previous studies, and quantify the population of RR galaxies using the SDSS complete sample. We conclude that the RR galaxies form a unique but rare population, accounting for only a small fraction of the massive quiescent galaxy population. We discuss the formation scenarios of the RR galaxies.

总结:<br />
2022年9月5日，太阳探测器帕克太阳探测器首次直接在日冕中进行了快速日冕物质抛射（CME）和冲击的原地测量。通过对帕克太阳探测器在近日点附近的原地测量，可以推测出两个冲击，第二个冲击已经衰减，与日冕图像中观察到的两次喷发一致。尽管发生了侧面穿越，测量结果表明了年轻喷射物的独特特征：等离子体的温度远高于环境介质，这表明了一个热的太阳源，并且大的等离子体β值表明了一个高度非力自由状态以及热压梯度对CME加速和膨胀的重要性。对全球日冕磁场的重建显示了日球际电流片（HCS）的长时间变化，观察到的磁场极性反转与更弯曲的HCS配置相符。在HCS穿越的内部观察到了重新连接迹象，深入到声速临界点。由于重新连接发生在次阿尔文速度风中，重新连接后的磁通量可以朝向太阳闭合，有助于平衡太阳圈中的磁通量。在HCS穿越后，次阿尔文速度风的性质作为低马赫数边界层（LMBL）导致在意外大的距离上进行了近亚声速等离子体的原位测量。 <div>
We report on the first direct in situ measurements of a fast coronal mass ejection (CME) and shock in the corona, which occurred on 2022 September 5. In situ measurements from the Parker Solar Probe spacecraft near perihelion suggest two shocks, with the second one decayed, which is consistent with more than one eruption in coronagraph images. Despite a flank crossing, the measurements indicate unique features of the young ejecta: a plasma much hotter than the ambient medium, suggestive of a hot solar source, and a large plasma β implying a highly non-force-free state and the importance of thermal pressure gradient for CME acceleration and expansion. Reconstruction of the global coronal magnetic fields shows a long-duration change in the heliospheric current sheet (HCS), and the observed field polarity reversals agree with a more warped HCS configuration. Reconnection signatures are observed inside an HCS crossing as deep as the sonic critical point. As the reconnection occurs in the sub-Alfvénic wind, the reconnected flux sunward of the reconnection site can close back to the Sun, which helps balance magnetic flux in the heliosphere. The nature of the sub-Alfvénic wind after the HCS crossing as a low Mach-number boundary layer (LMBL) leads to in situ measurements of the near subsonic plasma at a surprisingly large distance. Specifically, an LMBL may provide favorable conditions for the crossings of the sonic critical point in addition to the Alfvén surface.

We combine proper motions measured with the Hubble Space Telescope, Gaia, or a combination of the two, from a recent study by Bennet et al. with literature line-of-sight velocities (LOSVs) to give three components of motion. With these, we derive a 3D velocity dispersion anisotropy , consistent with the GCs forming a flattened system with significant azimuthal motion. We then apply a tracer mass estimator and measure an enclosed mass M⊙. This is broadly consistent with results from previous studies of the LOSVs of GCs and other luminous tracers. Assuming a cosmologically constrained Navarro–Frenk–White distribution for the dark matter, this implies a virial mass M⊙. Despite being an extrapolation by almost an order of magnitude in radius, this result is consistent with published estimates from other methods that are directly sensitive to the LMC’s total mass. Our results support the conclusion that the LMC is approximately % of the Milky Way’s mass, making it a significant contributor to the Local Group potential.

<div> M101, Type Ia supernova, Miras, Hubble Space Telescope, Hubble constant
<br /><br />总结:
这篇文章研究了M101中最近发生的Type Ia超新星SN 2011fe并通过发现和分类211个周期在240-400天之间的Miras，在Hubble Space Telescope (HST)的观测基础上得出了M101的第一个Mira基础距离。通过采用绝对标定的Mira周期-光度关系，得出了M101的距离，并发现了SN Ia的峰值亮度。作者还通过超新星Ia的哈勃图得出了Hubble常数H0 = 72.37 ± 2.97 km s−1 Mpc−1，这是Mirasa的4.1%测量值。最后得出的结论是，与最近的Cepheid距离梯度测量结果相比，本地宇宙的H0值高于早期宇宙的值，并且在95%的置信水平上证实了这一点。 <div>
The giant spiral galaxy M101 is host to the nearest recent Type Ia supernova (SN 2011fe) and thus has been extensively monitored in the near-infrared to study the late-time light curve of the SN. Leveraging this existing baseline of observations, we derive the first Mira-based distance to M101 by discovering and classifying a sample of 211 Miras with periods ranging from 240–400 days in the SN field. Combined with new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3/IR channel observations, our data set totals 11 epochs of F110W (HST YJ) and 13 epochs of F160W (HST H) data spanning ∼2900 days. We adopt absolute calibrations of the Mira period–luminosity relation based on geometric distances to the Large Magellanic Cloud and the water megamaser host galaxy NGC 4258, and find μM101 = 29.10 ± 0.06 mag. This distance is in 1σ agreement with most other recent Cepheid and tip of the red giant branch distance measurements to M101. Including the previous Mira SN Ia host, NGC 1559, and SN 2005df, we determine the fiducial SN Ia peak luminosity, mag. With the Hubble diagram of supernovae Ia, we derive H0 = 72.37 ± 2.97 km s−1 Mpc−1, a 4.1% measurement of H0 using Miras. We find excellent agreement with recent Cepheid distance ladder measurements of H0 and confirm previous indications that the local universe value of H0 is higher than the early universe value at ∼95% confidence. Currently, the Mira-based H0 measurement is still dominated by the statistical uncertainty in the SN Ia peak magnitude.

<div> 关键词: Parker Solar Probe, 太阳风, 阿尔芬速度, 速度相关性, 磁场波动

总结:
Parker Solar Probe自2021年4月以来的数据显示了太阳冠层的原位观测，揭示了太阳风形成和加速的过程。研究利用PSP的数据探究了α-质子速度差和它们在临界阿尔芬面（CAS）附近的特征。首先展示了α-质子差速度与PSP遭遇距离处的太阳风速度的正相关性。然后探讨了差速流在CAS附近的特征以及它们如何受到阿尔芬波动的影响。研究发现，在CAS以下，差速度通常小于CAS以上的差速度，并且局部阿尔芬速度很好地限制了差速。而当出现较大幅度的阿尔芬波动和差速减小时，即出现了差速与局部磁场矢量对齐度的偏差。此外，PSP观测到α质子速度从MA < 1到MA ≃ 2增加，然后开始减小，这表明α粒子可能在CAS以上仍然保持优先加速状态。我们的结果还揭示，在亚阿尔芬太阳风中，质子和α粒子的速度波动与磁场波动之间存在强烈的相关性，对于α粒子来说相关性较弱。相比之下，在超阿尔芬太阳风中，质子的相关性保持高水平，但对于α粒子而言则减弱。 <div>
Data obtained from Parker Solar Probe (PSP) since 2021 April have shown the first in situ observation of the solar corona, where the solar wind is formed and accelerated. Here, we investigate the alpha-proton differential flow and its characteristics across the critical Alfvén surface (CAS) using data from PSP during encounters 8–10 and 12–13. We first show the positive correlation between the alpha-proton differential velocity and the bulk solar wind speed at PSP encounter distances. Then we explore how the characteristics of the differential flow vary across the CAS and how they are affected by Alfvénic fluctuations including switchbacks. We find that the differential velocity below the CAS is generally smaller than that above the CAS, and the local Alfvén speed well limits the differential speed both above and below the CAS. The deviations from the alignment between the differential velocity and the local magnetic field vector are accompanied by large-amplitude Alfvénic fluctuations and decreases in the differential speed. Moreover, we observe that Vαp increases from MA < 1 to MA ≃ 2 and then starts to decrease, which suggests that alphas may remain preferentially accelerated well above the CAS. Our results also reveal that in the sub-Alfvénic solar wind both protons and alphas show a strong correlation between their velocity fluctuations and magnetic field fluctuations, with a weaker correlation for alphas. By contrast, in the super-Alfvénic regime the correlation remains high for protons, but is reduced for alphas.

<div> 辐射流体力学、原行星盘、H2泵浦、尘埃-气体质量比、质量损失率
总结:
辐射流体力学模拟原行星盘的结构和演化，显示H2泵浦和X射线加热在尘埃-气体质量比较低时对盘的质量损失有更强烈的贡献。盘的质量损失率随着尘埃减少而减小，但仍然维持在10^-10-11M⊙yr^-1左右。在这些缺乏尘埃的盘中，H2泵浦增强了内盘区域的光蒸发并塑造了盘的质量损失曲线。因此，我们认为晚期盘的演化受到紫外H2泵浦效应的影响。我们模拟得出的质量损失率可用于研究长期盘演化。 <div>
We perform radiation hydrodynamics simulations to study the structure and evolution of a photoevaporating protoplanetary disk. Ultraviolet and X-ray radiation from the host star heats the disk surface, where H2 pumping also operates efficiently. We run a set of simulations in which we varied the number of dust grains or the dust-to-gas mass ratio, which determines the relative importance between photoelectric heating and H2 pumping. We show that H2 pumping and X-ray heating contribute more strongly to the mass loss of the disk when the dust-to-gas mass ratio is . The disk mass-loss rate decreases with a lower dust amount, but remains around 10−10−11M⊙yr−1. In these dust-deficient disks, H2 pumping enhances photoevaporation from the inner disk region and shapes the disk mass-loss profile. We thus argue that the late-stage disk evolution is affected by the ultraviolet H2 pumping effect. The mass-loss rates derived from our simulations can be used in the study of long-term disk evolution.

<title>On the Formation of Double Neutron Stars in the Milky Way: Influence of Key Parameters</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The detection of gravitational wave events has stimulated theoretical modeling of the formation and evolution of double compact objects (DCOs). However, even for the most studied isolated binary evolution channel, there exist large uncertainties in the input parameters and treatments of the binary evolution process. So far, double neutron stars (DNSs) are the only DCOs for which direct observations are available through traditional electromagnetic astronomy. In this work, we adopt a population synthesis method to investigate the formation and evolution of Galactic DNSs. We construct 324 models for the formation of Galactic DNSs, taking into account various possible combinations of critical input parameters and processes such as mass transfer efficiency, supernova type, common envelope efficiency, neutron star kick velocity, and pulsar selection effect. We employ Bayesian analysis to evaluate the adopted models by comparing with observations. We also compare the expected DNS merger rate in the galaxy with that inferred from the known Galactic population of pulsar-neutron star systems. Based on these analyses we derive the favorable range of the aforementioned key parameters.

<title>Solar Spicules, Filigrees, and Solar Wind Switchbacks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Spicules, the smallest observable jetlike dynamic features ubiquitous in the chromosphere, are supposedly an important potential source for small-scale solar wind transients, with supporting evidence yet needed. We studied the high-resolution Hα images (0.″10) and magnetograms (0.″29) from the Big Bear Solar Observatory to find that spicules are an ideal candidate for the solar wind magnetic switchbacks detected by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). It is not that spicules are a miniature of coronal jets, but that they have unique properties not found in other solar candidates in explaining solar origin of switchbacks. (1) The spicules under this study originate from filigrees, all in a single magnetic polarity. Since filigrees are known as footpoints of open fields, the spicule guiding field lines can form a unipolar funnel, which is needed to create an SB patch, a group of field lines that switch from one common base polarity to the other polarity. (2) The spicules come in a cluster lined up along a supergranulation boundary, and the simulated waiting times from their spatial intervals exhibit a number distribution continuously decreasing from a few seconds to ∼30 minutes, similar to that of switchbacks. (3) From a time–distance map for spicules, we estimate their occurrence rate as 0.55 spicules Mm−2 s−1, which is sufficiently high for detection by PSP. In addition, the dissimilarity of spicules with coronal jets, including the absence of base brightening and low correlation with EUV emission, is briefly discussed.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
1RXS J083842.1−282723 is a nearly synchronous magnetic cataclysmic variable with a simple X-ray light curve. While its orbital period was fairly well established at Porb = 98.4 minutes from optical spectroscopy, indirect estimates of Pspin/Porb ranged from 0.90 to 0.96 because the short X-ray light curves could not determine the beat period to a factor of 2. We analyze a recent 50 days TESS observation, and ground-based optical time-series photometry spanning 9 yr, that together measure precise beat, orbit, and spin periods and enable the X-ray and optical modulations to be phase aligned. Although the X-ray light curves do not distinguish between a beat period of 16.11 or 32.22 hr, all of the optical evidence favors the longer value, with complete pole switching of accretion every half beat cycle. This would require Pspin/Porb = 0.952. Long-term optical monitoring also shows a decline in accretion rate, and a change in the beat-folded light curve. It would be useful to obtain a new X-ray/optical observation of at least 32 hr duration to examine any associated change in accretion structure, and to confirm the spin and beat periods.

<title>Investigation of Nulling and Subpulse-drifting Properties of PSR J1649+2533 with FAST</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the nulling and subpulse-drifting properties of PSR J1649+2533 with observations of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST). The FAST observations reveal that the nulling fraction of this pulsar is about 20.9% ± 0.8% at 1250 MHz. The statistical study of the durations of the nulling and burst states shows that the burst states can persist for extended pulse periods, exceeding 100 periods in some cases, while the shortest lasts only a few pulse periods. The null states have a much shorter duration, with a maximum duration of less than 30 pulse periods. A comparative study between the pulse profiles of the first active pulse (FAP) and the last active pulse (LAP) shows that the pulse profiles of LAPs are stronger and wider than those of FAPs. An analysis of the two-dimensional fluctuation spectrum for the single-pulse stack indicates that the pulsar exhibits clear amplitude modulation and subpulse drifting. The periods are a P3 = 2.5 ± 0.1 spin period and P2 = 17.°0 ± 0.°5 at 1250 MHz, respectively. In addition, the multiband investigation shows that P2 seems to increase with the increase of the observing frequency, i.e., P2 ∝ ν0.8±0.1. This seems to be caused by the increasing pulse-profile width with the frequency. The high-sensitivity FAST observations will enable a detailed understanding of the emission of this pulsar and provide important clues for theoretical studies of the radiation mechanism.

<div> 850 μm, polarization, circumstellar envelope, AGB star, grain alignment
<br /><br />
总结: 本研究对碳星IRC+10216的星周环境进行了850μm极化观测。研究发现850 μm极化的几何结构与Zeeman观测和CSE中的小尺度结构一致，可能由磁偶极子几何所致。此外，研究还提出了一个新的颗粒对齐机制，认为带电颗粒在磁场中运动时会绕着感应的电场进动，从而与磁场对齐。这一机制能够解释碳尘在光学、远红外和亚毫米波段的极化现象，只需考虑颗粒的电荷状态不同即可。 <div>
We present SCUBA-2/POL-2 850 μm polarimetric observations of the circumstellar envelope (CSE) of the carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star IRC+10216. Both far-IR (FIR) and optical polarization data indicate grains aligned with their long axis in the radial direction relative to the central star. The 850 μm polarization does not show this simple structure. The 850 μm data are indicative, albeit not conclusive, of a magnetic dipole geometry. Assuming such a simple dipole geometry, the resulting 850 μm polarization geometry is consistent with both Zeeman observations and small-scale structure in the CSE. While there is significant spectral-line polarization contained within the SCUBA-2 850 μm passband for the source, it is unlikely that our broadband polarization results are dominated by line polarization. To explain the required grain alignment, grain mineralogy effects, due to either fossil silicate grains from the earlier oxygen-rich AGB phase of the star or due to the incorporation of ferromagnetic inclusions in the largest grains, may play a role. We argue that the most likely explanation is due to a new alignment mechanism wherein a charged grain, moving relative to the magnetic field, precesses around the induced electric field and therefore aligns with the magnetic field. This mechanism is particularly attractive as the optical, FIR, and submillimeter-wave polarization of the carbon dust can then be explained in a consistent way, differing simply due to the charge state of the grains.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章报告了对天体潮裂事件（TDE）AT2020ksf/Gaia20cjk的X射线光谱的发现。在UV/光学峰值后约230天，X射线明亮度急剧增加。研究发现，在初始阶段没有显著的吸收特征，但在几天内出现，并在峰值后770天仍然被探测到。作者发现，简单的热连续模型结合幂律或中性吸收体并不能很好地描述这些特征。添加部分覆盖、低速离子化吸收体可以改善早期拟合，但在后期会失效。高速（速度约42,000 km/s）的离子化吸收体（UFO）可以很好地拟合所有数据。研究还讨论了X射线延迟的几种解释场景，以及更大尺度风反馈的潜力。这一发现的偶然性可能表明TDE中UFO的高发生率，缓解了与理论预期的某些张力。 <div>
Supermassive black holes can experience super-Eddington peak mass fallback rates following the tidal disruption of a star. The theoretical expectation is that part of the infalling material is expelled by means of an accretion disk wind, whose observational signature includes blueshifted absorption lines of highly ionized species in X-ray spectra. To date, however, only one such ultrafast outflow (UFO) has been reported in the tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN–14li. Here we report on the discovery of a transient absorption-like signature in X-ray spectra of the TDE AT2020ksf/Gaia20cjk (at a redshift of z = 0.092), following an X-ray brightening ∼230 days after UV/optical peak. We find that while no statistically significant absorption features are present initially, they appear on a timescale of several days and remain detected up to 770 days after peak. Simple thermal continuum models, combined with a power-law or neutral absorber, do not describe these features well. Adding a partial-covering, low-velocity ionized absorber improves the fit at early times but fails at late times. A high-velocity (vw ∼ 42,000 km s−1), ionized absorber (UFO) provides a good fit to all data. The few-day timescale of variability is consistent with expectations for a clumpy wind. We discuss several scenarios that could explain the X-ray delay, as well as the potential for larger-scale wind feedback. The serendipitous nature of the discovery could suggest a high incidence of UFOs in TDEs, alleviating some of the tension with theoretical expectations.

The era of the James Webb Space Telescope ushers stellar population models into uncharted territories, particularly at the high-redshift frontier. In a companion paper, we apply the Prospector Bayesian framework to jointly infer galaxy redshifts and stellar population properties from broadband photometry as part of the UNCOVER survey. Here we present a comprehensive error budget in spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling. Using a sample selected to have photometric redshifts higher than 9, we quantify the systematic shifts stemming from various model choices in inferred stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and age. These choices encompass different timescales for changes in the star formation history (SFH), nonuniversal stellar initial mass functions (IMF), and the inclusion of variable nebular abundances, gas density, and ionizing photon budget. We find that the IMF exerts the strongest influence on the inferred properties: the systematic uncertainties can be as much as 1 dex, 2–5 times larger than the formal reported uncertainties in mass and SFR, and importantly, exceed the scatter seen when using different SED fitting codes. Although the assumptions on the lower end of the IMF induce degeneracy, our findings suggest that a common practice in the literature of assessing uncertainties in SED-fitting processes by comparing multiple codes is substantively underestimating the true systematic uncertainty. Highly stochastic SFHs change the inferred SFH by much larger than the formal uncertainties, and introduce ∼0.8 dex systematics in SFR averaged over a short timescale and ∼0.3 dex systematics in average age. Finally, employing a flexible nebular emission model causes ∼0.2 dex systematic increase in mass and SFR, comparable to the formal uncertainty. This paper constitutes an initial step toward a complete uncertainty estimate in SED modeling.

混合对棕矮星和巨行星大气中的化学反应产生影响，而大气模型通常使用Kzz扩散参数来参数化这种混合。研究表明，金属丰度和C/O比值也会影响大气化学。本研究提出了Sonora Elf Owl自洁云的大气网格模型，覆盖了几个数量级的Kzz变化以及次太阳到超太阳金属丰度和C/O比值。观察发现，在金属贫乏的物体中，Kzz对大气的影响在较高有效温度下较大，而在富金属的大气中，Kzz的影响则出现在较低有效温度下。研究还发现，在3-5μm波长窗口存在Kzz和金属丰度的光谱重叠。通过自洁模型，我们发现这些物体中存在很低效的垂直混合，推测的Kzz值在约101-104 cm2 s-1之间。观测揭示了这种缓慢的垂直混合是由于探测到了这些大气中深层脱离的辐射区的混合。 <br /><br />总结: 混合对大气化学有影响，金属丰度和C/O比值也会影响大气化学；Sonora Elf Owl网格模型包含了Kzz变化、金属丰度和C/O比值，研究发现在不同条件下Kzz对大气产生不同影响；研究发现在特定波长范围存在Kzz和金属丰度的光谱重叠；对九个早至晚T型物体进行观测，并发现了垂直混合效率较低的迹象；观测揭示了这种缓慢的垂直混合是由于探测到了这些大气中深层脱离的辐射区的混合。 <div>
Disequilibrium chemistry due to vertical mixing in the atmospheres of many brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets is well established. Atmosphere models for these objects typically parameterize mixing with the highly uncertain Kzz diffusion parameter. The role of mixing in altering the abundances of C-N-O-bearing molecules has mostly been explored for atmospheres with a solar composition. However, atmospheric metallicity and the C/O ratio also impact atmospheric chemistry. Therefore, we present the Sonora Elf Owl grid of self-consistent cloud-free 1D radiative-convective equilibrium model atmospheres for JWST observations, which includes a variation in Kzz across several orders of magnitude and also encompasses subsolar to supersolar metallicities and C/O ratios. We find that the impact of Kzz on the T(P) profile and spectra is a strong function of both Teff and metallicity. For metal-poor objects, Kzz has large impacts on the atmosphere at significantly higher Teff than in metal-rich atmospheres, where the impact of Kzz is seen to occur at lower Teff. We identify significant spectral degeneracies between varying Kzz and metallicity in multiple wavelength windows, in particular, at 3–5 μm. We use the Sonora Elf Owl atmospheric grid to fit the observed spectra of a sample of nine early to late T-type objects from Teff = 550–1150 K. We find evidence for very inefficient vertical mixing in these objects, with inferred Kzz values lying in the range between ∼101 and 104 cm2 s−1. Using self-consistent models, we find that this slow vertical mixing is due to the observations, which probe mixing in the deep detached radiative zone in these atmospheres.

ALMA观测了Orion B分子云中与HH270mms1相关的原恒星流。通过12CO (J = 3−2)的发射，发现分子流的速度结构包括低速度、中速度、高速度和包围低速度分子的夹带气体的速度。高速和中速流具有良好的聚束结构，而节点链嵌入在高速流或射流中。通过观测发现，低速和中速分子流中存在垂直于流轴线的速度梯度。确认了外层和盘的旋转，并发现它们的速度梯度与分子流相同。此外，根据观测到的分子流特性，估计了低速和中速流的发射半径，得出了射流从内盘区域驱动的结论。文章内容符合最近的理论研究的预期特征。<br /><br />总结: 分子流呈现出低速度、中速度和高速度结构，嵌入着射流和旋转特性。观测结果符合最新的理论研究。 <div>
We present molecular line observations of the protostellar outflow associated with HH270mms1 in the Orion B molecular cloud with ALMA. The 12CO (J = 3−2) emissions show that the outflow velocity structure consists of four distinct components of low (≲10 km s−1), intermediate (∼10–25 km s−1) and high (≳40 km s−1) velocities in addition to the entrained gas velocity (∼25–40 km s−1). The high- and intermediate-velocity flows have well-collimated structures surrounded by the low-velocity flow. The chain of knots is embedded in the high-velocity flow or jet, which is the evidence of episodic mass ejections induced by time-variable mass accretion. We could detect the velocity gradients perpendicular to the outflow axis in both the low- and intermediate-velocity flows. We confirmed the rotation of the envelope and disk in the 13CO and C17O emission and found that their velocity gradients are the same as those of the outflow. Thus, we concluded that the velocity gradients in the low- and intermediate-velocity flows are due to the outflow rotation. Using observational outflow properties, we estimated the outflow launching radii to be 67.1–77.1 au for the low-velocity flow and 13.3–20.8 au for the intermediate-velocity flow. Although we could not detect the rotation in the jets due to the limited spatial resolution, we estimated the jet launching radii to be (2.36–3.14) × 10−2 au using the observed velocity of each knot. Thus, the jet is driven from the inner disk region. We could identify the launching radii of distinct velocity components within a single outflow with all the prototypical characteristics expected from recent theoretical works.

总结:
这篇文章介绍了一种利用卷积神经网络(CNN)对类星体的多波段光谱能量分布(SEDs)进行建模的新方法。他们在一种包括同步辐射和逆Compton发射的轻子模型上训练了CNN。这种方法显著减少了计算时间，实现了对多波段数据集的实时拟合。他们还展示了如何使用训练好的CNN和MultiNest来拟合Mrk 421和1ES 1959+650的宽带SEDs，并成功获得了它们的参数后验分布。这种新的SED拟合框架将进一步扩展，以加入基于外部Compton和强子场景的更复杂模型，并通过Markarian多波段数据中心的网页界面公开提供这些模型，以促进类星体观测的多信使数据的自洽建模。<br /><br /> <div>
Modeling the multiwavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of blazars provides key insights into the underlying physical processes responsible for the emission. While SED modeling with self-consistent models is computationally demanding, it is essential for a comprehensive understanding of these astrophysical objects. We introduce a novel, efficient method for modeling the SEDs of blazars by the mean of a convolutional neural network (CNN). In this paper, we trained the CNN on a leptonic model that incorporates synchrotron and inverse Compton emissions, as well as self-consistent electron cooling and pair creation–annihilation processes. The CNN is capable of reproducing the radiative signatures of blazars with high accuracy. This approach significantly reduces the computational time, thereby enabling real-time fitting to multiwavelength data sets. As a demonstration, we used the trained CNN with MultiNest to fit the broadband SEDs of Mrk 421 and 1ES 1959+650, successfully obtaining their parameter posterior distributions. This novel framework for fitting the SEDs of blazars will be further extended to incorporate more sophisticated models based on external Compton and hadronic scenarios, allowing for multimessenger constraints in the analysis. The models will be made publicly available via a web interface at the Markarian Multiwavelength Data Center to facilitate self-consistent modeling of multimessenger data from blazar observations.

<div> 关键词: 太阳能粒子事件, 元素丰度增强, 电子分布, 离子化相互作用, 温度估计

总结:
太阳能粒子（SEP）事件的重要方面是它们的来源群体。文章探讨了来自假定的日冕重连事件的冲击SEP事件的元素丰度增强，以及在加速过程中电子分布的影响，以及离子化相互作用对电荷状态的影响。研究发现，电子速度分布是否偏离麦克斯韦分布并不显著影响加速区温度的估计。这表明SEP在较短时间内加速并离开加速区，与离子化时间尺度相比。 <br /><br /> <div>
An important aspect of solar energetic particle (SEP) events is their source populations. Elemental abundance enhancements of impulsive SEP events, originating in presumed coronal reconnection episodes, can be fitted to steep power laws of A/Q, where A and Q are the atomic mass and ionic charge. Since thermal electron energies are enhanced and nonthermal electron distributions arise in the reconnection process, we might expect that ionic charge states Q would be increased through ionization interactions with those electron populations during the acceleration process. The temperature estimated from the SEPs corresponds to the charge state during the acceleration process, while the actual charge state measured in situ may be modified as the SEPs pass through the corona. We examine whether the temperature estimation from the A/Q would differ with various κ values in a κ function representing high-energy tail deviating from a Maxwellian velocity distribution. We find that the differences in the A/Q between a Maxwellian and an extreme κ distribution are about 10%–30%. We fit power-law enhancement of element abundances as a function of their A/Q with various κ values. Then, we find that the derived source region temperature is not significantly affected by whether or not the electron velocity distribution deviates from a Maxwellian, i.e., thermal, distribution. Assuming that electrons are heated in the acceleration region, the agreement of the SEP charge state during acceleration with typical active region temperatures suggests that SEPs are accelerated and leave the acceleration region in a shorter time than the ionization timescale.

Estimating the magnetic field strength in the solar corona is crucial for understanding different physical processes happening over diverse spatiotemporal scales. However, the high temperatures and low density of the solar corona make this task challenging. The coronal magnetic field is too weak to produce a measurable splitting of the spectral lines using the Zeeman effect, and high temperature causes spectral lines to become weak and broad, making it difficult to detect the small Zeeman splitting. Coronal magneto-seismology, which combines the theoretical and observed properties of magnetohydrodynamic waves, can be used to infer the magnetic field strength of oscillating structures in the solar corona, which are otherwise difficult to estimate. In this work, we use the Doppler velocity and density data obtained from the Coronal Multichannel Polarimeter on 2016 October 14 to obtain the global map of the coronal magnetic field using Bayesian inference. Two priors are used for plasma density, viz Gaussian and uniform distributions. Bayesian inference provides us with the probability distribution for the magnetic field strength at each location from 1.05 to 1.35 R⊙. A comparison between the magnetic field obtained using simple inversion and Bayesian inference is also drawn. We find that the values obtained using simple inversion do not always match the maximum posterior estimates obtained using Bayesian inference. We find that the inferred values follow a power-law function for the radial variation of the coronal magnetic field, with the power-law indices for simple and Bayesian inversion being similar.

<div> 关键词: 早期太阳系，26Al，超新星，原行星盘，太阳系起源<br />
总结: 早期太阳系含有一种短寿命放射性核素26Al，据信它的衰变能控制了小行星的热演化，可能也影响了行星的水含量。一种可能的假设是“盘注入情形”，即在原行星盘形成后，附近(<1 pc)的超新星将放射性物质直接注入盘中。然而，研究发现需要超新星产生的26Al量很大，且注入后会改变盘的温度，这与太阳系的实际情况不符。因此，推测早期太阳系中的新鲜26Al可能以其他方式合成/注入。 <div>
The early solar system contained a short-lived radionuclide, 26Al (its half-life time t1/2 = 0.7 Myr). The decay energy of 26Al is thought to have controlled the thermal evolution of planetesimals and, possibly, the water contents of planets. Many hypotheses have been proposed for the origin of 26Al in the solar system. One of the possible hypotheses is the “disk injection scenario”: when the protoplanetary disk of the solar system had already formed, a nearby (<1 pc) supernova injected radioactive material directly into the disk. Such a 26Al injection hypothesis has been tested so far with limited setups for disk structure and supernova distance, which have treated disk disruption and 26Al injection separately. Here, we revisit this problem, to investigate whether there are self-consistent conditions under which the surviving disk radius can receive enough 26Al to account for the abundance in the early solar system. We also consider a range of disk masses and structures, 26Al yields from supernova, and a large dust mass fraction ηd. We find that 26Al yields of supernova are required as , which are challenging to achieve with the known possible 26Al ejection and dust mass fraction ranges. Furthermore, we find that even if the above conditions are met, the supernova flow changes the disk temperature, which may not be consistent with the solar system record. Our results place a strong constraint on the disk injection scenario. Rather, we suggest that the fresh 26Al of the early solar system must have been synthesized/injected in other ways.

We summarize the entire known sample of these types of companion systems, termed “compositional benchmarks,” that are present in the literature or recently published as key systems of study in order to best understand brown dwarf chemistry and condensate formation. Via mass balance and stoichiometric calculations, we predict a median brown dwarf atmospheric oxygen sink of by utilizing published stellar abundances in the local solar neighborhood. Additionally, we predict a silicate condensation sequence such that atmospheres with bulk Mg/Si ≲0.9 will form enstatite (MgSiO3) and quartz (SiO2) clouds, and atmospheres with bulk Mg/Si ≳0.9 will form enstatite and forsterite (Mg2SiO4) clouds. The implications of these results on C/O ratio trends in substellar-mass objects and the utility of these predictions in future modeling work are discussed.

<title>AT2022cmc: A Tidal Disruption Event with a Two-component Jet in a Bondi-profile Circumnuclear Medium</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A supermassive black hole can launch a relativistic jet when it violently disrupts a star that passes too close. Such jetted tidal disruption events (TDEs) are rare and unique tools to investigate quiescent supermassive black holes, jet physics, and circumnuclear environments at high redshift. The newly discovered TDE AT2022cmc (z ∼ 1.193), providing rich multiband (X-ray, UV, optical, submillimeter, and radio) data, has been interpreted as the fourth on-axis jetted TDE. In this work, we constrain the circumnuclear medium (CNM) density profile with both a closure relation test and detailed forward shock model fit with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to the multiband (optical, submillimeter, and radio) data of AT2022cmc. We find that the CNM density profile of AT2022cmc is n ∝ R−k with k ∼ 1.68, implying a Bondi accretion in history. Furthermore, our model fit result suggests a two-component jet in AT2022cmc, indicating similar jet physics to well-studied jetted TDE Sw J1644+57.

<title>Radio Pulsar B0950+08: Radiation in the Magnetosphere and Sparks above the Surface</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We observed the nearby radio pulsar B0950+08, which has a 100% duty cycle, using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope. We obtained the polarization profile for its entire rotation, which enabled us to investigate its magnetospheric radiation geometry and the sparking pattern of the polar cap. After we excluded part of the profile in which the linear polarization factor is low (≲30%) and potentially contaminated by jumps in position angle, the rest of the swing in polarization position angle fits a classical rotating vector model (RVM) well. The best-fit RVM indicates that the inclination angle, α, and the impact angle, β, of this pulsar, are 100.°5 and −33.°2, respectively, suggesting that the radio emission comes from two poles. We find that, in such RVM geometry, either the annular vacuum gap model or the core vacuum gap model would require that the radio emissions come from a high-altitude magnetosphere with heights from ∼0.25 RLC to ∼0.56 RLC, with RLC being the light cylinder radius. Both the main and interpulses’ sparking points are located away from the magnetic pole, which could relate to the physical conditions on the pulsar surface.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Space plasmas are turbulent and maintain different types of critical points or flow nulls. Electron vortex, as one type of flow null structure, is crucial in the energy cascade in turbulent plasmas. However, due to the limited time resolution of the spacecraft observations, one can never analyze the three-dimensional properties of the electron vortex. In the present study, with the advancement of the FOTE-V method and the unprecedented high-resolution measurements from four Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft, we successfully identify the electron vortex and then reconstruct its three-dimensional topology of the surrounding electron flow field. The results of the reconstruction show that the configuration of the electron vortex is elliptical. Comparison between the observation and reconstruction scales of the vortex indicates the reliable reconstruction of the flow velocity. Our study sheds light on the understanding of the topology and property of the electron vortex and its relationship with kinetic-scale magnetic holes.

<title>A Theory for Neutron Star and Black Hole Kicks and Induced Spins</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using 20 long-term 3D core-collapse supernova simulations, we find that lower compactness progenitors that explode quasi-spherically due to the short delay to explosion experience smaller neutron star recoil kicks in the ∼100−200 km s−1 range, while higher compactness progenitors that explode later and more aspherically leave neutron stars with kicks in the ∼300−1000 km s−1 range. In addition, we find that these two classes are correlated with the gravitational mass of the neutron star. This correlation suggests that the survival of binary neutron star systems may in part be due to their lower kick speeds. We also find a correlation between the kick and both the mass dipole of the ejecta and the explosion energy. Furthermore, one channel of black hole birth leaves masses of ∼10 M⊙, is not accompanied by a neutrino-driven explosion, and experiences small kicks. A second channel is through a vigorous explosion that leaves behind a black hole with a mass of ∼3.0 M⊙ kicked to high speeds. We find that the induced spins of nascent neutron stars range from seconds to ∼10 ms, but do not yet see a significant spin/kick correlation for pulsars. We suggest that if an initial spin biases the explosion direction, a spin/kick correlation would be a common byproduct of the neutrino mechanism of core-collapse supernovae. Finally, the induced spin in explosive black hole formation is likely large and in the collapsar range. This new 3D model suite provides a greatly expanded perspective and appears to explain some observed pulsar properties by default.

We present a quantum treatment of atom–electron collisions in magnetic fields, demonstrating the significant importance of including the effect of exchange that arises from two interacting electrons. We find strange behaviors that are not encountered in collisions without a magnetic field. In high magnetic fields, exchange can lead to orders of magnitude enhancements of collision cross sections. Additionally, the elastic collision cross sections that involve the ground state become comparable to those involving excited states, and states with large orbits have the largest contribution to the collisions. We anticipate significant changes to spectral line broadening in neutron star surfaces and atmospheres.

总结: 
本文使用Bayesian方法对NANOGrav 12.5年数据进行了引力波记忆的搜索，未发现任何具有说服力的信号。通过更灵活的红噪声模型，与GW记忆信号相关的支持度减少至1.3。根据天空位置和事件时刻，我们计算了GW记忆事件的应变上限，发现中位数应变上限约为3.3×10^-14。部分天空位置的应变上限存在差异，PSR J0613−0200周围存在一些额外噪声可能与GW记忆混淆。最后，应变上限随着时间的推移而改善，这归因于脉冲星定时阵列的持续增长。 <div>
We present the results of a Bayesian search for gravitational wave (GW) memory in the NANOGrav 12.5 yr data set. We find no convincing evidence for any gravitational wave memory signals in this data set. We find a Bayes factor of 2.8 in favor of a model that includes a memory signal and common spatially uncorrelated red noise (CURN) compared to a model including only a CURN. However, further investigation shows that a disproportionate amount of support for the memory signal comes from three dubious pulsars. Using a more flexible red-noise model in these pulsars reduces the Bayes factor to 1.3. Having found no compelling evidence, we go on to place upper limits on the strain amplitude of GW memory events as a function of sky location and event epoch. These upper limits are computed using a signal model that assumes the existence of a common, spatially uncorrelated red noise in addition to a GW memory signal. The median strain upper limit as a function of sky position is approximately 3.3 × 10−14. We also find that there are some differences in the upper limits as a function of sky position centered around PSR J0613−0200. This suggests that this pulsar has some excess noise that can be confounded with GW memory. Finally, the upper limits as a function of burst epoch continue to improve at later epochs. This improvement is attributable to the continued growth of the pulsar timing array.

We present results from the search for astrometric accelerations of stars in ω Centauri using 13 yr of regularly scheduled Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/UVIS calibration observations in the cluster core. The high-precision astrometry of ∼160,000 sources was searched for significant deviations from linear proper motion. This led to the discovery of four cluster members and one foreground field star with compelling acceleration patterns. We interpreted them as the result of the gravitational pull by an invisible companion and determined preliminary Keplerian orbit parameters, including the companion’s mass. For the cluster members, our analysis suggests periods ranging from 8.8 to 19+ yr and dark companions in the mass range of ∼0.7 to ∼1.4M☉. At least one companion could exceed the upper mass boundary of white dwarfs and can be classified as a neutron star candidate.

总结: 这篇论文研究了银河系的灰尘消光曲线在近红外的特征，通过对SDSS和2MASS的星表数据进行分析，发现在低至中等灰尘密度范围内，消光曲线的斜率βNIR没有系统性变化，平均值为1.85。此外，发现βNIR与RV之间没有内在的相关性。这些结果对于typical sightlines是适用的，不包括靠近银心的尘埃密集区域或RV大于4的罕见视线。最后，发现RH = 0.345，这对Cepheid的校准和H0的测定有一定的影响。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
The Milky Way dust extinction curve in the near-infrared (NIR) follows a power-law form, but the value of the slope, βNIR, is debated. Systematic variations in the slope of the Milky Way UV extinction curve are known to be correlated with variations in the optical slope (through RV), but whether such a dependence extends to the NIR is unclear. Finally, because of low dust column densities, the NIR extinction law is poorly understood at high Galactic latitudes where most extragalactic work takes place. In this paper, we construct extinction curves from 56,649 stars with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Two Micron All Sky Survey photometry, based on stellar parameters from SDSS spectra. We use dust maps to identify dust-free stars, from which we calibrate the relation between stellar parameters and intrinsic colors. Furthermore, to probe the low-dust regime at high latitudes, we use aggregate curves based on many stars. We find no systematic variation of βNIR across low-to-moderate dust columns (0.02 < E(B − V) ≲ 1), and report average βNIR = 1.85 ± 0.01, in agreement with the law in the 2019 Fitzpatrick et al. study, but steeper than the Cardelli et al. and 1999 Fitzpatrick laws. Star-to-star scatter in βNIR is relatively small (σ(βNIR) = 0.13). We also find no intrinsic correlation between βNIR and RV (there is an apparent correlation that is the result of the correlated uncertainties in the two values). These results hold for typical sightlines; we do not probe very dusty regions near the Galactic Center, nor rare sightlines with RV > 4.

主要研究M31星系中大质量恒星的环境，通过多分辨率的遮光测量来探究其周围的星际介质。根据Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT)项目中得到的恒星光度和贝叶斯遮光和恒星工具（BEAST）拟合的模型，建立了一份包含42,107个主序大质量恒星候选者的目录。使用核密度估计来量化星系环境，比较了BEAST提供的高分辨率消光估计和PHAT的25 pc分辨率的尘埃图，测量了消光的总柱密度分布。研究发现，尽管尘埃的平均总柱密度随着大质量恒星的密度增加而增加，但朝向这些恒星的平均视线消光在所有环境中保持不变。这表明，大质量恒星在其周围拥有相同数量的尘埃，而不受其在星系中的位置的影响。这些结果表明，在M31星系中，大质量恒星是在稀疏区域中形成的，而不是迁移到那里。<br /><br />总结: 该研究利用M31星系中恒星的测量数据探究了大质量恒星的形成环境，发现了尘埃密度与恒星密度的关系，以及大质量恒星周围的消光情况。研究结果表明，大质量恒星在M31星系中是在稀疏区域中形成的，而不是迁移到那里。 <div>
Resolving the environments of massive stars is crucial for understanding their formation mechanisms and their impact on galaxy evolution. An important open question is whether massive stars found in diffuse regions outside spiral arms formed in situ or migrated there after forming in denser environments. To address this question, we use multiresolution measurements of extinction in the Andromeda galaxy (M31) to probe the interstellar medium surrounding massive stars across galactic environments. We construct a catalog of 42,107 main-sequence massive star candidates (M ≥ 8 M⊙) using resolved stellar photometry from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) program, plus stellar and dust model fits from the Bayesian Extinction and Stellar Tool (BEAST). We quantify galactic environments by computing surrounding stellar densities of massive stars using kernel density estimation. We then compare high-resolution line-of-sight extinction estimates from the BEAST with 25 pc resolution dust maps from PHAT, measuring the total column density distribution of extinction. Our key finding is that, although the average total column density of dust increases with the density of massive stars, the average line-of-sight extinction toward massive stars remains constant across all environments. This suggests that massive stars have a uniform amount of dust in their immediate environment, regardless of their location in the galaxy. One possible explanation for these findings is that small molecular clouds are still capable of forming massive stars, even if they are not resolvable at 25 pc. These results indicate that massive stars are forming in the sparse regions of M31, as opposed to migrating there.

在这项研究中，我们考虑了辐射冷却纤维状分子云在引力坍缩过程中的等离子扩散效应。我们考虑了磁场的两种不同配置，即轴向和环向，在等离子扩散的情况下，对于辐射冷却的纤维状分子云会导致两种不同的问题。在两种磁场配置下，纤维状分子云都会被等离子扩散辐射冷却和加热。我们使用自相似方法来求解每种情况下得到的方程。我们发现绝热指数和等离子扩散率在冷却纤维坍缩过程中起着非常重要的作用。结果表明，等离子加热显著增加了冷却纤维中间区域的温度。此外，我们发现等离子扩散在坍缩过程中具有非常重要的影响，以至于在冷却纤维中间区域，其加热效应比其动力学效应更为突出。得到的结果还提到了一些区域，那里的星体形成速率相对观测报告来说更多或更少。 <br /><br />总结: ambipolar diffusion对纤维状分子云的引力坍缩过程起着重要作用，其加热效应显著增加了纤维中间区域的温度。在一些区域，等离子扩散的影响使得星体形成速率有所不同。 <div>
In this study, we consider the effects of ambipolar diffusion during the gravitational collapse of a radiative cooling filamentary molecular cloud. Two separate configurations of magnetic field, i.e., axial and toroidal, are considered in the presence of the ambipolar diffusion for a radiative cooling filament. These configurations lead to two different formulations of the problem. The filament is radiatively cooled and heated by ambipolar diffusion in both cases of magnetic field configurations. The self-similar method is used to solve the obtained equations in each case. We found that the adiabatic exponent and ambipolar diffusivity play very important roles during the gravitational collapse of a cooling filament. The results show that the ambipolar heating significantly increases the temperature in the middle regions of a cooling filament. Furthermore, we found that the ambipolar diffusion has very important effects during the collapse, so that its heating effect is dominant over its dynamical effect in the middle regions of a cooling filament. The obtained results also address some regions where the rate of star formation is more or less compared to the observational reports.

<div> DESI Bright Galaxy Survey, pSMF, One-percent Survey, stellar mass, BGS

总结:
DESI亮星系调查中的概率星族质量函数(pSMF)利用一次性调查观测的数据推导出星系的质量函数，使用了概率价值增值BGS (PROVABGS) 贝叶斯光谱能量分布建模框架，推导出了亮星系和暗星系样本的pSMF以及星系的红移演化。研究显示pSMF与文献中的质量函数测量结果相当一致，展示出DESI Bright Galaxy Survey在研究低红移时尺度关系的统计能力。 <div>
We present the probabilistic stellar mass function (pSMF) of galaxies in the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS), observed during the One-percent Survey. The One-percent Survey was one of DESI’s survey validation programs conducted from 2021 April to May, before the start of the main survey. It used the same target selection and similar observing strategy as the main survey and successfully observed the spectra and redshifts of 143,017 galaxies in the r < 19.5 magnitude-limited BGS Bright sample and 95,499 galaxies in the fainter surface-brightness- and color-selected BGS Faint sample over z < 0.6. We derive pSMFs from posteriors of stellar mass, M*, inferred from DESI photometry and spectroscopy using the Hahn et al. PRObabilistic Value-Added BGS (PROVABGS) Bayesian spectral energy distribution modeling framework. We use a hierarchical population inference framework that statistically and rigorously propagates the M* uncertainties. Furthermore, we include correction weights that account for the selection effects and incompleteness of the BGS observations. We present the redshift evolution of the pSMF in BGS, as well as the pSMFs of star-forming and quiescent galaxies classified using average specific star formation rates from PROVABGS. Overall, the pSMFs show good agreement with previous stellar mass function measurements in the literature. Our pSMFs showcase the potential and statistical power of BGS, which in its main survey will observe >100 × more galaxies. Moreover, we present the statistical framework for subsequent population statistics measurements using BGS, which will characterize the global galaxy population and scaling relations at low redshifts with unprecedented precision.

总结:
NGC 3603是银河系中最明亮的GH ii区域，通过中红外成像调查发现其辐射区域。利用多波段观测数据，发现了14个可能是MYSOs的紧凑源。同时，也检测到了3个大质量原行星盘候选体以及演化蓝色超巨星Sher 25的盘和喷流的尘埃辐射。通过多波段数据推导了NGC 3603内部星形成凝块的辐射-质量比和维里参数，估计了它们的相对年龄，并发现与之前研究过的GH ii区域相比，NGC 3603是一个年龄较大的GH ii区域，呈空腔型。相比于类似的连续裂解光子速率的分布型GH ii区域，NGC 3603的MYSOs和分子凝块数量较为适度。 <div>
We present our sixth set of results from our mid-infrared imaging survey of Milky Way Giant H ii regions with our detailed analysis of NGC 3603, the most luminous giant H ii (GH ii) region in the Galaxy. We used imaging data from the FORCAST instrument on the Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) at 20 and 37 μm, which mapped the central ∼8.′5 × 8.′5 infrared-emitting area of NGC 3603 at a spatial resolution of ≲3″. Utilizing these SOFIA data in conjunction with multiwavelength observations from the near-infrared to radio, including Spitzer-IRAC and Herschel-PACS archival data, we investigate the physical nature of individual infrared sources and subcomponents within NGC 3603. For individual compact sources, we used the multiwavelength photometry data to construct spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and fit them with massive young stellar object (MYSO) SED models, and find 14 sources that are likely to be MYSOs. We also detect dust emission from the 3 massive proplyd candidates, as well as from the disk and outflow of the evolved blue supergiant, Sher 25. Utilizing multiwavelength data, we derived luminosity-to-mass ratio and virial parameters for the star-forming clumps within NGC 3603, estimating their relative ages and finding that NGC 3603 is an older GH ii region overall, compared to our previously studied GH ii regions. We discuss how NGC 3603, which we categorize as a cavity-type GH ii region, exhibits a more modest number of MYSOs and molecular clumps when compared to the distributed-type GH ii regions that share similar Lyman continuum photon rates.

<div> 高红移星系、三维形态推断、贝叶斯模型、椭圆度、三轴性<br />

在这篇文章中，研究者使用了不同iable贝叶斯模型和Hamilton Monte Carlo方法来推断James Webb Space Telescope Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science观测中高红移星系的三维形态。他们发现高质量和低红移的星系呈现更加椭圆的形态，而高质量和高红移的星系呈现更加三轴对称的形态，暗示了星系的发展趋势。他们还同时推断了三维尺寸和质量之间的关系，以及其与三维几何形态的相关性。最后，他们讨论了选择效应、后续观测前景和理论意义。<br /> <div>
The 3D geometries of high-redshift galaxies remain poorly understood. We build a differentiable Bayesian model and use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to efficiently and robustly infer the 3D shapes of star-forming galaxies in James Webb Space Telescope Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science observations with at z = 0.5–8.0. We reproduce previous results from the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey in a fraction of the computing time and constrain the mean ellipticity, triaxiality, size, and covariances with samples as small as ∼50 galaxies. We find high 3D ellipticities for all mass–redshift bins, suggesting oblate (disky) or prolate (elongated) geometries. We break that degeneracy by constraining the mean triaxiality to be ∼1 for dwarfs at z > 1 (favoring the prolate scenario), with significantly lower triaxialities for higher masses and lower redshifts indicating the emergence of disks. The prolate population traces out a “banana” in the projected diagram with an excess of low-b/a, large- galaxies. The dwarf prolate fraction rises from ∼25% at z = 0.5–1.0 to ∼50%–80% at z = 3–8. Our results imply a second kind of disk settling from oval (triaxial) to more circular (axisymmetric) shapes with time. We simultaneously constrain the 3D size–mass relation and its dependence on 3D geometry. High-probability prolate and oblate candidates show remarkably similar Sérsic indices (n ∼ 1), nonparametric morphological properties, and specific star formation rates. Both tend to be visually classified as disks or irregular, but edge-on oblate candidates show more dust attenuation. We discuss selection effects, follow-up prospects, and theoretical implications.

AGN燃料来源的研究得到了促进，研究者通过Sloan数字化巡天IV（SDSS-IV）的MaNGA积分场谱学调查，建立了一个包含387个AGN的目录。通过结合MaNGA AGN目录和基于合并星系的一系列水动力学模拟识别的新SDSS星系合并目录，研究了星系合并和AGN核活动之间的联系。发现在约1011M⊙的恒星质量星系中，与非合并星系相比，合并星系中AGN的超额较强。进一步的研究发现，合并星系和AGN光度或吸积率之间没有相关性。总结：虽然总体上星系合并似乎会比非合并星系触发或增强AGN活动，但它们似乎并不会引起更高水平的吸积或更高的光度。我们为科学界提供MaNGA AGN目录和MaNGA星系合并目录。 <div>
To facilitate new studies of galaxy-merger-driven fueling of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we present a catalog of 387 AGNs that we have identified in the final population of over 10,000 z < 0.15 galaxies observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-IV (SDSS-IV) integral field spectroscopy survey Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA). We selected the AGNs via mid-infrared Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer colors, Swift/Burst Alert Telescope ultra-hard X-ray detections, NRAO Very Large Array Sky Survey and Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters radio observations, and broad emission lines in SDSS spectra. By combining the MaNGA AGN catalog with a new SDSS catalog of galaxy mergers that were identified based on a suite of hydrodynamical simulations of merging galaxies, we study the link between galaxy mergers and nuclear activity for AGNs above a limiting bolometric luminosity of 1044.4 erg s−1. We find an excess of AGNs in mergers, relative to nonmergers, for galaxies with stellar mass ∼1011M⊙, where the AGN excess is somewhat stronger in major mergers than in minor mergers. Further, when we combine minor and major mergers and sort by merger stage, we find that the highest AGN excess occurs in post-coalescence mergers in the highest-mass galaxies. However, we find no evidence of a correlation between galaxy mergers and AGN luminosity or accretion rate. In summary, while galaxy mergers overall do appear to trigger or enhance AGN activity more than nonmergers, they do not seem to induce higher levels of accretion or higher luminosities. We provide the MaNGA AGN Catalog and the MaNGA Galaxy Merger Catalog for the community here.

Gravitational wave (GW) standard siren observations provide a rather useful tool to explore the evolution of the Universe. In this work, we wish to investigate whether dark sirens with neutron star (NS) deformation from third-generation GW detectors could help probe the interaction between dark energy and dark matter. We simulate the GW dark sirens of four detection strategies based on 3 yr observation and consider four phenomenological interacting dark energy (IDE) models to perform cosmological analysis. We find that GW dark sirens could provide tight constraints on Ωm and H0 in the four IDE models but do not perform well in constraining the dimensionless coupling parameter β in models of the interaction proportional to the energy density of cold dark matter. Nevertheless, the parameter degeneracy orientations of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and GW are almost orthogonal, and thus, the combination of them could effectively break cosmological parameter degeneracies, with the constraint errors of β being 0.00068–0.018. In addition, we choose three typical equations of state (EoSs) of an NS, i.e., SLy, MPA1, and MS1, to investigate the effect of an NS’s EoS on cosmological analysis. The stiffer EoS could give tighter constraints than the softer EoS. Nonetheless, the combination of CMB and GW dark sirens (using different EoSs of an NS) shows basically the same constraint results of cosmological parameters. We conclude that the dark sirens from 3G GW detectors would play a crucial role in helping probe the interaction between dark energy and dark matter, and the CMB+GW results are basically not affected by the EoS of an NS.

We present a study of a sample of 45 spectroscopically confirmed, UV luminous galaxies at z ∼ 6. They were selected as bright Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) using deep multiband optical images in more than 2 deg2 of the sky, and subsequently identified via their strong Lyα emission. The majority of these LBGs span an absolute UV magnitude range from −22.0 to −20.5 mag with Lyα equivalent width (EW) between ∼10 and ∼200 Å, representing the most luminous galaxies at z ∼ 6 in terms of both UV continuum emission and Lyα line emission. We model the spectral energy distributions of 10 LBGs that have deep infrared observations from Hubble Space Telescope, JWST, and/or Spitzer, and find that they have a wide range of stellar masses and ages. They also have high star formation rates ranging from a few tens to a few hundreds of solar mass per year. Five of the LBGs have JWST or HST images, and four of them show compact morphology in these images, including one that is roughly consistent with a point source, suggesting that UV luminous galaxies at this redshift are generally compact. The fraction of our photometrically selected LBGs with strong Lyα emission (EW > 25 Å) is about 0.2, which is consistent with previous results and supports a moderate evolution of the intergalactic medium opacity at the end of cosmic reionization. Using deep X-ray images, we do not find evidence of strong active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity in these galaxies, but our constraint is loose, and we are not able to rule out the possibility of any weak AGN activity.

<title>Simple Model for Temporal Variations of Hα Spectrum by an Eruptive Filament from a Superflare on a Solar-type Star</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Flares are intense explosions on the solar and stellar surfaces, and solar flares are sometimes accompanied by filament or prominence eruptions. Recently, a large filament eruption associated with a superflare on a solar-type star EK Dra was discovered for the first time. The absorption of the Hα spectrum initially exhibited a blueshift with the velocity of 510 km s−1, and decelerated in time probably due to gravity. Stellar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) were thought to occur, although the filament eruption did not exceed the escape velocity under the surface gravity. To investigate how such a filament eruption can occur and whether CMEs are associated with the filament eruption or not, we perform a one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation of the flow along an expanding magnetic loop emulating a filament eruption under adiabatic and unsteady conditions. The loop configuration and expanding velocity normal to the loop are specified in the configuration parameters, and we calculate the line-of-sight velocity of the filament eruption using the velocities along and normal to the loop. We find that (i) the temporal variations of the Hα spectrum for EK Dra can be explained by a falling filament eruption in the loop with longer time and larger spatial scales than that of the Sun, and (ii) the stellar CMEs are also thought to be associated with the filament eruption from the superflare on EK Dra, because the rarefied loop unobserved in the Hα spectrum needs to expand faster than the escape velocity, whereas the observed filament eruption does not exceed the escape velocity.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report on the spectroscopic confirmation of a massive quiescent galaxy at zspec = 4.53 in the COSMOS field. The object was first identified as a galaxy with suppressed star formation at zphot ∼ 4.65 from the COSMOS2020 catalog. The follow-up spectroscopy with Keck/MOSFIRE in the K band reveals faint [O ii] emission and the Balmer break, indicative of evolved stellar populations. We fit the spectral energy distribution using photometry and a spectrum to infer physical properties. The obtained stellar mass is high (M* ∼ 1010.8M⊙) and the current star formation rate is more than 1 dex below that of main-sequence galaxies at z = 4.5. Its star formation history suggests that this galaxy experienced rapid quenching from z ∼ 5. The galaxy is among the youngest quiescent galaxies confirmed so far at zspec > 3 with zform ∼ 5.2 (200 Myr ago), which is the epoch when 50% of the total stellar mass was formed. A unique aspect of the galaxy is that it is in an extremely dense region; there are four massive star-forming galaxies at 4.4 < zphot < 4.7 located within 150 physical kpc from the galaxy. Interestingly, three of them have virial radii that strongly overlap with that of the central quiescent galaxy (∼70 kpc), suggesting that the overdensity region is likely the highest-redshift candidate of a dense group with a spectroscopically confirmed quiescent galaxy at the center. The group provides us with a unique opportunity to gain insights into the role of the group environment in quenching at z ∼ 5, which corresponds to the formation epoch of massive elliptical galaxies in the local Universe.

<title>The Remarkable Predictive Power of Infrared Data of Blazars</title>

Blazars are the brightest and most abundant persistent sources in the extragalactic γ-ray sky. Due to their significance, they are often observed across various energy bands, where the data of which can be used to explore potential correlations between emission at different energies, yielding valuable insights into the emission processes of their powerful jets. In this study we utilized IR data at 3.4 and 4.6 μm from the Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer Reactivation Mission, spanning 8 yr of observations, X-ray data from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory collected throughout the satellite’s lifetime, and 12 years of γ-ray measurements from the Fermi Large Area Telescope’s all-sky survey. Our analysis reveals that the IR spectral slope reliably predicts the peak frequency and maximum intensity of the synchrotron component of blazar spectral energy distributions, provided it is uncontaminated by radiation unrelated to the jet. A notable correlation between the IR and γ-ray fluxes was observed, with the BL Lacertae subclass of blazars displaying a strong correlation coefficient of r = 0.80. IR band variability is more pronounced in flat spectrum radio quasars than in BL Lacertae objects, with mean fractional variability values of 0.65 and 0.35, respectively. We also observed that the synchrotron peak intensity of intermediate-high-energy-peaked objects can forecast their detectability at very high γ-ray energies. We used this predicting power to identify objects in current catalogs that could meet the detection threshold of the Cerenkov Telescope Array extragalactic survey, which should encompass approximately 180 blazars.

<title>Very High-energy (>50 GeV) Gamma-Ray Flux Variability of Bright Fermi Blazars</title>

Understanding the high-energy emission processes and variability patterns are two of the most challenging research problems associated with relativistic jets. In particular, the long-term (months to years) flux variability at very high energies (VHE >50 GeV) has remained an unexplored domain so far. This is possibly due to the decreased sensitivity of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) above a few GeV, hence low photon statistics, and observing constraints associated with the ground-based Cherenkov telescopes. This paper reports the results obtained from the 0.05−2 TeV Fermi-LAT data analysis of a sample of 29 blazars with the primary objective to explore their months-to-year-long very high-energy (VHE) flux variability behavior. This systematic search has led to, for the first time, the detection of significant flux variations in five blazars at the >99% confidence level, whereas eight of them exhibit variability, albeit at a lower confidence level (∼95%–99%). A comparison of the 0.05–2 TeV flux variations with that observed at 0.1–50 GeV band has revealed similar variability behavior for most of the sources. However, complex variability patterns that are not reflected contemporaneously in both energy bands were also detected, thereby providing tantalizing clues about the underlying radiative mechanisms. These results open up a new dimension to unravel the VHE emission processes operating in relativistic jets, hence sowing the seeds for their future observations with the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array.

Voyager 1 and 2 are only the two spacecraft that have arrived and passed through the heliospheric boundaries. Based on the plasma data from the Voyager 2 spacecraft, the electron quasi-thermal noise (QTN) is investigated by using of the electron population model consisting of a core with Maxwellian distribution and a halo with kappa distribution. The power spectra of the electron QTN is calculated at different heliocentric distances from 1 to 110 au. The parametric dependence of the QTN power spectra and the effective Debye length on the model parameters, such as the density ratio and temperature ratio of the halo to the core, kappa index and the antenna length, are discussed further. The results show that the electron QTN spectrum consists of a plateau in the low frequency band f < fpt, a prominent peak at the plasma frequency fpt, and a rapid decreasing part in the high frequency band f > fpt. The QTN plateau level basically falls down outwards until the termination shock crossing at about 84 au, after which the plateau rebounds a little near the heliopause. Although the model parameters can be very variable, the QTN plateau level does not present more than the double change in a fairly wide range of the model parameters. The presented results can be useful for future deep-space explorations in the heliosphere and can provide valuable references for the design of onboard detectors.

Lyman limit systems (LLSs) are dense hydrogen clouds with high enough H i column densities to absorb Lyman continuum photons emitted from distant quasars. Their high column densities imply an origin in dense environments; however, the statistics and distribution of LLSs at high redshifts still remain uncertain. In this paper, we use self-consistent radiative transfer cosmological simulations from the Cosmic Reionization on Computers (CROC) project to study the physical properties of LLSs at the tail end of cosmic reionization at z ∼ 6. We generate 3000 synthetic quasar sight lines to obtain a large number of LLS samples in the simulations. In addition, with the high physical fidelity and resolution of CROC, we are able to quantify the association between these LLS samples and nearby galaxies. Our results show that the fraction of LLSs spatially associated with nearby galaxies increases with H i column density. Moreover, we find that LLSs that are not near any galaxy typically reside in filamentary structures connecting neighboring galaxies in the intergalactic medium (IGM). This quantification of the distribution and association of LLSs to large-scale structure informs our understanding of the IGM–galaxy connection during the “Epoch of Reionization,” and provides a theoretical basis for interpreting future observations.

<title>COOL-LAMPS. VI. Lens Model and New Constraints on the Properties of COOL J1241+2219, a Bright z = 5 Lyman Break Galaxy and its z = 1 Cluster Lens</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a strong lensing analysis of COOL J1241+2219, the brightest known gravitationally lensed galaxy at z ≥ 5, based on new multiband Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging data. The lensed galaxy has a redshift of z = 5.043, placing it shortly after the end of the “Epoch of Reionization,” and an AB magnitude zAB = 20.47 mag (Khullar et al.). As such, it serves as a touchstone for future research of that epoch. The high spatial resolution of HST reveals internal structure in the giant arc, from which we identify 15 constraints and construct a robust lens model. We use the lens model to extract the cluster mass and lensing magnification. We find that the mass enclosed within the Einstein radius of the z = 1.001 cluster lens is , significantly lower than other known strong lensing clusters at its redshift. The average magnification of the giant arc is 〈μarc〉 = , a factor of greater than previously estimated from ground-based data; the flux-weighted average magnification is 〈μarc〉 = . We update the current measurements of the stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) of the source for the revised magnification to 9.7 ± 0.3 and SFR = M⊙ yr−1, respectively. The powerful lensing magnification acting upon COOL J1241+2219 resolves the source and enables future studies of the properties of its star formation on a clump-by-clump basis. The lensing analysis presented here will support upcoming multiwavelength characterization with HST and JWST data of the stellar mass assembly and physical properties of this high-redshift lensed galaxy.

<title>On the Possibility of an Upper Limit on Magnetically Induced Radius Inflation in Low-mass Stars</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The radii of low-mass stars are observed to be inflated above standard model predictions, especially in magnetically active stars. Typically, the empirical relative radius inflations ΔR/R are ≤10% but in (rare) cases may be ≥20%. Our magneto-convective stellar models have already replicated many empirical ΔR/R values. Here, we ask: is there any theoretical upper limit on the amount of such inflation? We use our magneto-convective model to compute ΔR/R using empirically plausible values of the surface field strength parameter δ. Inside each model, the maximum internal field is set to a particular value: Bceil = 10, or 100 kG, or 1 MG. When Bceil = 10 kG, peak inflation with ΔR/R ≈ 90% occurs in stars with masses of 0.7 M⊙. With Bceil = 100 kG, peak inflation with ΔR/R ≈ 140% occurs in stars with M ≈ 0.5 M⊙. But with Bceil = 1 MG, we find no peak in ΔR/R as a function of δ; instead, the larger δ is, the larger ΔR/R becomes, reaching 300%–350% in the case of the largest δ considered. Thus, magneto-convective modeling can accommodate ΔR/R values which are considerably larger than any reported empirical inflations. We find that a maximum occurs in ΔR/R as a function of δ only in model stars where the field reaches its maximum strength Bceil inside the convective envelope. Moreover, our models of completely convective stars undergo smaller amounts of relative radius inflation than models with radiative cores, a result consistent with some previous reports.

<title>A Transition Discovered in the Subcritical Regime of 1A 0535+262</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present NICER observations of the accreting X-ray pulsar 1A 0535+262 during its faint state (≲6 × 1036 erg s−1), observed in several type I and type II outbursts. We discovered a transition of temporal and spectral properties around the luminosity Lt = 3.3 × 1035 erg s−1, below which spectra are relatively soft and the pulse profiles have only a narrow peak. The spectra are harder and a secondary hump gradually appears in the pulse profiles when L ≳ Lt. We discuss possible physical mechanisms for this transition, including different Comptonization seed photons, the disappearance of gas shocks on the neutron star surface, and the combination of plasma and vacuum polarization effects.

<br /><br />
研究热木星的大气动力学时，了解全球环流和化学之间的相互作用非常重要。本文介绍了二维光化学运输模型VULCAN 2D，该模型通过允许非均匀纬向风改进了伪二维方法。我们对VULCAN 2D进行了广泛的验证，并应用到HD 189733 b和HD 209458 b，揭示了混合机制的转变。针对先前推断的富碳大气，我们发现超太阳C/O比的HD 209458 b在早晨边缘呈现出明显的C2H4吸收，而在晚上边缘则没有，这归因于来自夜侧的水平运输。最后，我们用合成光谱展示了水平运输在透射观测中的影响及其对晨晚边缘不对称性的影响，强调在解释外行星大气时考虑全球运输的必要性。 
<br /><br />总结: 这篇文章介绍了VULCAN 2D模型，并讨论了热木星的大气动力学以及其对化学的影响。研究发现水平运输在下层主导，而在高空垂直混合更为重要。针对HD 209458 b的观测发现，考虑全球运输对解释大气现象非常重要。 <div>
The atmospheric dynamics of tidally locked hot Jupiters is characterized by strong equatorial winds. Understanding the interaction between global circulation and chemistry is crucial in atmospheric studies and interpreting observations. Two-dimensional (2D) photochemical transport models shed light on how the atmospheric composition depends on circulation. In this paper, we introduce the 2D photochemical (horizontal and vertical) transport model, VULCAN 2D, which improves on the pseudo-2D approaches by allowing for nonuniform zonal winds. We extensively validate our VULCAN 2D with analytical solutions and benchmark comparisons. Applications to HD 189733 b and HD 209458 b reveal a transition in mixing regimes: horizontal transport predominates below ∼0.1 mbar, while vertical mixing is more important at higher altitudes above 0.1 mbar. Motivated by the previously inferred carbon-rich atmosphere, we find that HD 209458 b with supersolar carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) exhibits pronounced C2H4 absorption on the morning limb but not on the evening limb, due to horizontal transport from the nightside. We discuss when a pseudo-2D approach is a valid assumption and its inherent limitations. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of horizontal transport in transmission observations and its impact on the morning−evening limb asymmetry with synthetic spectra, highlighting the need to consider global transport when interpreting exoplanet atmospheres.

<div> 关键词: 太阳耀斑，光谱线，大气层，辐射传递，速度场

总结: 太阳耀斑期间，光谱线的形成受到上层区域的影响，表现出复合的出射强度曲线。通过辐射-流体动力学和辐射传递计算模拟了太阳/恒星大气对电子束加热的响应，合成了铁离子的光谱线并研究了通过多普勒频移得到的视线速度场信息。研究发现，光谱线变化主要由色球层的变化引起，该区域的上升气流能够在线心产生蓝移或伪红移，取决于与光球层相比的相对贡献。在极端太阳和恒星耀斑情景中，爆炸性的色球凝结物也可以主导轮廓形状的暂时性红移，需要考虑三元分量才能完全表征。因此，深层形成的光谱线需要多组分的理解和处理，光谱线的不同区域对大气速度流动的探测都是有用的。 <div>
During solar flares, spectral lines formed in the photosphere have been shown to exhibit changes to their profiles despite the challenges of energy transfer to these depths. Recent work has shown that deep-forming spectral lines are subject to significant contributions from regions above the photosphere throughout the flaring period, resulting in a composite emergent intensity profile from multiple layers of the atmosphere. We employ radiative–hydrodynamic and radiative transfer calculations to simulate the response of the solar/stellar atmosphere to electron beam heating and synthesize spectral lines of Fe i to investigate the line-of-sight velocity fields information available from Doppler shifts of the emergent intensity profile. By utilizing the contribution function to deconstruct the line profile shape into its constituent sources, we show that variations in the line profiles are primarily caused by changes in the chromosphere. Up-flows in this region were found to create blueshifts or false redshifts in the line core dependent on the relative contribution of the chromosphere compared to the photosphere. In extreme solar and stellar flare scenarios featuring explosive chromospheric condensations, redshifted transient components can dominate the temporal evolution of the profile shape, requiring a tertiary component consideration to fully characterize. We conclude that deep-forming lines require a multicomponent understanding and treatment, with different regions of the spectral line being useful for probing individual regions of the atmosphere’s velocity flows.

<div> 关键词: 尘埃颗粒, 太阳星云, 行星形成, 涡流, 盘片金属

总结:
本文研究了太阳星云中尘埃颗粒的长期存活条件，发现在弱湍流、平坦径向压力梯度和高金属含量的条件下（α∼10−6, η≲10−3, Z∼0.1），直径为1毫米的尘埃颗粒可以在太阳星云中存活并保持其大小超过106年。这与最近的观测结果相符。最后，文章提出行星体形成可能是由盘片演化引起的，例如由于盘片风的内向扩散导致。 <div>
The lifetime of millimeter-sized dust grains, such as chondrules, in the nominal solar nebula model is limited to ∼105 yr, due to an inward drift driven by gas drag. However, isotopic and petrological studies of primitive meteorites indicate a discrepancy of ≳106 yr between the formation time of chondrules and that of chondritic parent bodies. Therefore, chondrules should survive for ≳106 yr in the solar nebula against the inward drift without subsequent growth (i.e., planetesimal formation). Here, we investigate the conditions of the solar nebula that are suitable for the long lifetime of chondrule-sized dust particles. We take the turbulent strength, the radial pressure gradient force, and the disk metallicity of the solar nebula as free parameters. For 1 mm radius chondrules to survive and keep their size for ≳106 yr, the suitable condition is a weak turbulence (α ∼ 10−6), a flat radial profile (η ≲ 10−3), and a high metallicity (Z ∼ 0.1). This condition is qualitatively consistent with the characteristics of protoplanetary disks suggested by recent observations. We eventually propose that planetesimal formation may be induced by disk evolution, e.g., the inside-out dispersal of the gas component due to the disk wind.

Iron Kα (Fe Kα) emission is observed ubiquitously in active galactic nuclei (AGN), and it is a powerful probe of their circumnuclear environment. Examinations of the emission line play a pivotal role in understanding the disk geometry surrounding black holes. It has been suggested that the torus and the broad-line region (BLR) are the origins of emission. However, there is no universal location for the emitting region relative to the BLR. Here, we present an analysis of the narrow component of the Fe Kα line in the Seyfert AGN MCG-5-23-16, one of the brightest AGN in X-rays and in Fe Kα emission, to localize the emitting region. Spectra derived from Chandra/HETGS observations show asymmetry in the narrow Fe Kα line, which has only been confirmed before in the AGN NGC 4151. Models including relativistic Doppler broadening and gravitational redshifts are preferred over simple Gaussians and measure radii consistent with R ≃ 200–650 rg. These results are consistent with those of NGC 4151 and indicate that the narrow Fe Kα line in MCG-5-23-16 is primarily excited in the innermost part of the optical BLR, or X-ray BLR. Characterizing the properties of the narrow Fe Kα line is essential for studying the disk geometries of the AGN population and mapping their innermost regions.

合并星系UGC 5205是一个在低红移处很罕见的沉寂型低质量星系。虽然具有丰富的冷气体和紫外线发射，表明在过去的几亿年内有显著的星形成活动，但是最近∼10百万年内却没有探测到Hα发射-星的形成。新的Karl G.Jansky超大阵观测显示，UGC 5205星系中主体的H i非常扰动，大部分H i存在于几千秒差距长的尾部，而PGC 027864的H i受有序旋转的影响。研究对UGC 5205的恒星群进行建模表明，一致的UV和Hα发射表明，星系约100-300百万年前经历了一个协调的淬火事件。UGC 5205和PGC 027864的不对称结果表明，主要的合并事件既可以淬火也可以触发矮星的形成。然而，由于气体仍然与系统结合，我们建议这样的合并仅暂时淬火星形成。我们估计UGC 5205的总淬火时间约为∼560百万年，与研究已建立的矮星体淬火部分的上限约为几个百分比一致。<br /><br />总结:合并星系UGC 5205具有丰富的冷气体和紫外线发射，但最近的Hα发射显示其星形成被淬火。通过H i观测发现，UGC 5205缺乏H i，而PGC 027864具有有序旋转的H i。研究模拟表明UGC 5205的淬火事件约为100-300百万年前发生，暗示主要合并事件会暂时淬火星形成。 <div>
It is exceedingly rare to find quiescent low-mass galaxies in the field at low redshift. UGC 5205 is an example of such a quenched field dwarf (M⋆ ∼ 3 × 108 M⊙). Despite a wealth of cold gas (MHI ∼ 3.5 × 108 M⊙) and UV emission that indicates significant star formation in the past few hundred megayears, there is no detection of Hα emission—star formation in the last ∼10 Myr—across the face of the galaxy. Meanwhile, the near equal-mass companion of UGC 5205, PGC 027864, is starbursting (which has an Hα equivalent width > 1000 Å). In this work, we present new Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array 21 cm line observations of UGC 5205, showing that the lack of star formation is caused by an absence of H i in the main body of the galaxy. The H i of UGC 5205 is highly disturbed; the bulk of the H i resides in several-kiloparsec–long tails, while the H i of PGC 027864 is dominated by ordered rotation. We model the stellar populations of UGC 5205 to show that, as indicated by the UV and Hα emission, the galaxy underwent a coordinated quenching event ∼100–300 Myr ago. The asymmetry of outcomes for UGC 5205 and PGC 027864 demonstrate that major mergers can both quench and trigger star formation in dwarfs. However, because the gas remains bound to the system, we suggest that such mergers only temporarily quench star formation. We estimate a total quenched time of ∼560 Myr for UGC 5205, consistent with established upper limits on the quenched fraction of a few percent for dwarfs in the field.

Using an idealized climate model incorporating seasonal forcing, we investigate the impact of rotation rate on the abundance of clouds on an Earth-like aquaplanet, and the resulting impacts upon albedo and seasonality. We show that the cloud distribution varies significantly with season, depending strongly on the rotation rate, and is well explained by the large-scale circulation and atmospheric state. Planetary albedo displays nonmonotonic behavior with rotation rate, peaking at around 1/2ΩE. Clouds reduce the surface temperature and total precipitation relative to simulations without clouds at all rotation rates, and reduce the dependence of total precipitation on rotation rate, causing nonmonotonic behavior and a local maximum around 1/8ΩE; these effects are related to the impacts of clouds on the net atmospheric and surface radiative energy budgets. Clouds also affect the seasonality. The influence of clouds on the extent of the winter Hadley cell and the intertropical convergence zone is relatively minor at slow rotation rates (<1/8ΩE), but becomes more pronounced at intermediate rotation rates, where clouds decrease their maximum latitudes. The timing of seasonal transitions varies with rotation rate, and the addition of clouds reduces the seasonal phase lag.

<div> 关键词: polytropic index, solar corona, LTE, ionization-recombination, plasma cocktail
总结:
本文通过理论模拟解决了观测到的太阳日冕多普勒/绝热指数γ下降的现象。研究发现，在含有重元素的太阳等离子体混合物中，离子化-复合反应的化学过程在局部热力学平衡(LTE)状态下导致了1.1<γ≤5/3。通过数值求解Saha方程并利用新推导的方程计算多普勒指数，得出了该结果。此外，观测到的缓慢磁流体波在日冕环中的传播速度与LTE离子化仅占观测到的γ下降的一小部分，这意味着太阳活跃区的等离子体并未处于预期的LTE状态。然而，当前的理论方法证实了温度升高时更高的多普勒指数的依赖性。综上所述，为了解释太阳日冕活跃区内多普勒指数的下降，有必要进行动力学非LTE离子化计算。 <div>
An initial theoretical attempt to explain the observed decrease of the polytropic/adiabatic index γ in the solar corona has been accomplished. The chemical reactions of the ionization–recombination processes in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) of a solar plasma cocktail containing heavy elements are found to cause 1.1 < γ ≤ 5/3 in the quiet solar atmosphere. It is also shown that the quiet solar atmosphere is in LTE, justifying this theoretical study. This result is obtained by numerically solving the Saha equation and subsequently using a newly derived equation for calculation of the polytropic index from thermodynamic partial derivatives of the enthalpy and pressure with respect to density and temperature. In addition, a comparison measured from spectroscopic observations of propagating slow magnetohydrodynamic waves in coronal loops shows that LTE ionization accounts for a very small part of the observed decrease of γ, meaning that the solar plasma in the active region is not in LTE as expected. However, the observed dependency of higher polytropic index at higher temperatures is confirmed by the current theoretical approach. It is concluded that in order to account for the polytropic index decrease in the active regions of the solar corona, it is necessary for kinetic non-LTE ionization calculations to be performed.

本文研究了低质量M型矮星的潮汐耗散对短周期太阳系外行星系统轨道结构的影响。通过非摄动谱方法计算了完全对流M型矮星的正常模式振荡，并计算了每种模式的耗散潮汐响应。研究发现非绝热耦合是耗散计算的重要组成部分。根据耗散结果，对潮汐在宿主恒星中的影响进行了计算。研究发现共面行星轨道因共振锁定而发生轨道迁移，影响周期小于1.5天的地球质量行星和周期小于2.5天的木星质量行星的轨道。由于共振驱动的轨道衰减和外移，预测在周期约1天内缺乏小行星，同时周期约3天内更大行星数量也很稀少。 <div>
The orbital architectures of short-period exoplanet systems are shaped by tidal dissipation in their host stars. For low-mass M dwarfs whose dynamical tidal response comprises a dense spectrum of inertial modes at low frequencies, resolving the frequency dependence of tidal dissipation is crucial to capturing the effect of tides on planetary orbits throughout the evolutionary stages of the host star. We use nonperturbative spectral methods to calculate the normal mode oscillations of a fully convective M dwarf modeled using realistic stellar profiles from MESA. We compute the dissipative tidal response composed of contributions from each mode, as well as nonadiabatic coupling between the modes, which we find to be an essential component of the dissipative calculations. Using our results for dissipation, we then compute the evolution of circular, coplanar planetary orbits under the influence of tides in the host star. We find that orbital migration driven by resonance locking affects the orbits of Earth-mass planets at orbital periods Porb ≲ 1.5 days and of Jupiter-mass planets at Porb ≲ 2.5 days. Due to resonantly driven orbital decay and outward migration, we predict a dearth of small planets closer than Porb ∼ 1 day and similarly sparse numbers of more massive planets out to Porb ∼ 3 days.

<div> 关键词: 分析模型, 初代星, 宿主暗物质晕, 红移, 数值模拟
总结:
本文开发了一个分析模型，用于描述初代星在原始气云中心形成的质量，作为宿主暗物质晕质量、红移和旋转程度的函数。模型基于对三个过程关键时间尺度的估计：气云坍缩、原恒星核吸积和原恒星核辐射反馈。最终的恒星质量取决于直到辐射反馈停止吸积的总吸积质量。这种分析估计出于全数值模拟的结果，导出了代数表达式，执行速度极快。尽管简单，该模型复制了观察到的最新宇宙学放大模拟中的恒星质量尺度和其参数依赖关系。这项工作阐明了支撑这种数值处理的基本物理原理，并为高效调整数值预测以符合最终观测到的初代星提供了途径。 <div>
We develop an analytic model for the mass of the first stars forming in the centers of primordial gas clouds as a function of host halo mass, redshift, and degree of rotation. The model is based on the estimation of key timescales determining the following three processes: the collapse of the gas cloud, the accretion onto the protostellar core, and the radiative feedback of the protostellar core. The final stellar mass is determined by the total mass accreted until the radiative feedback halts the accretion. The analytic estimation, motivated by the result of the full numerical simulations, leads to algebraic expressions allowing an extremely fast execution. Despite its simplicity, the model reproduces the stellar mass scale and its parameter dependencies observed in state-of-the-art cosmological zoom-in simulations. This work clarifies the basic physical principles undergirding such numerical treatments and provides a path to efficiently calibrating numerical predictions against eventual observations of the first stars.

<div> 观测、JWST/NIRCam slitless grism spectroscopy、Mg II absorption、星系、再电离

在这项研究中，研究人员利用深度的JWST/NIRCam slitless grism spectroscopy观测了29个星系周围冷弥散气体的新现象，这些星系的红移在2.3到6.3之间。它们的质量跨度很大，并且具有SFR/M⊙ yr−1 < 2.3的星形成率。研究发现，在距离类星体J0100+2802的视线附近300 kpc处有七个Mg II吸收系统。Mg II径向吸收剖面随半径急剧下降，大部分吸收延伸至宿主星系的2-3倍R200。其中六个Mg II吸收系统与质量为9的星系相关。Mg II吸收的动力学偏移与宿主星系的系统红移不同，其中位动速度约为135 km/s，标准偏差约为85 km/s。未绑定到宿主星系的Mg II吸收系统数量较高，表明在再电离末期，星系的晕层处于显著失衡状态，并且在丰富星系间介质方面非常高效。最强的两个Mg II吸收系统分别在z∼4.22和4.5处检测到，前者与一个合并的星系系统相关，后者与三个动力学接近的星系相关。这些星系都位于局部星系密集区，表明在z>4时存在两个“原星系团”中的冷Mg II吸收。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究利用JWST/NIRCam slitless grism spectroscopy观测了29个星系周围的冷弥散气体，发现其中七个Mg II吸收系统。这些吸收系统显示出高动力学偏移和大径向分离，表明大部分Mg II气体与其宿主星系不是通过引力约束在一起的。此外，两个最强的Mg II吸收系统出现在星系合并和星系密集区，暗示着在z>4时存在原星系团。 <div>
We report new observations of the cool diffuse gas around 29, 2.3 < z < 6.3 galaxies using deep JWST/NIRCam slitless grism spectroscopy around the sight line to the quasar J0100+2802. The galaxies span a stellar mass range of , and star formation rates (SFRs) of SFR/M⊙ yr−1 < 2.3. We find galaxies for seven Mg ii absorption systems within 300 kpc of the quasar sight line. The Mg ii radial absorption profile falls off sharply with radius, with most of the absorption extending out to 2–3 R200 of the host galaxies. Six out of seven Mg ii absorption systems are detected around galaxies with 9. The Mg ii absorption kinematics are shifted from the systemic redshifts of host galaxies with a median absolute velocity ≈ 135 km s−1 and standard deviation ≈ 85 km s−1. The high kinematic offset and large radial separation (R > 1.3 R200), suggest that five out of the seven Mg ii absorption systems are not gravitationally bound to their host galaxy. In contrast, most of the cool circumgalactic medium at z < 1 is gravitationally bound. The high incidence of unbound Mg ii gas in this work suggests that toward the end of reionization, galaxy halos are in a state of remarkable disequilibrium, and are highly efficient in enriching the intergalactic medium. The two strongest Mg ii absorption systems are detected at z ∼ 4.22 and 4.5, the former associated with a merging galaxy system and the latter associated with three kinematically close galaxies. Both of these galaxies reside in local galaxy overdensities, indicating the presence of cool Mg ii absorption in two “protogroups” at z > 4.

总结:<br />
这篇文章研究了Taurus分子云中最近检测到的1-和2-氰基萘和氰基苯的真空紫外光动力学。通过合并同步辐射和双成像电子/离子的巧合实验装置，实验得到了所有三种分子的高分辨率阈电子光谱，从中汇报了绝对精度很高的绝热电离能，特别是对于2-氰基萘，这是在这个精度水平上没有数据的。理论计算用于比较离子的基态的阈电子光谱。此外，通过外价格林函数计算，已经将扩展的阈电子光谱中观察到的不同特征分配给不同的分子轨道。该研究还阐明了光电子的动能分布，以描述它们对星际介质中的光电加热效应的贡献。最后，通过估计总离子产额，我们估算了几种星际辐射场的光速率。最后，我们讨论了两种氰基萘的光解离，借助Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus建模报告了解离通道的活化能。观察到CN取代对VUV解离光电离弛豫通道没有引起任何明显变化。 <div>
We investigate the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photodynamics of gas phase 1- and 2-cyanonaphthalene and cyanobenzene, recently detected in the Taurus molecular cloud, by combining synchrotron radiation and a double imaging electron/ion coincidence setup. The high-resolution threshold photoelectron spectra (TPES) of all three molecules are obtained experimentally from which the adiabatic ionization energies are reported with very high accuracy, particularly for 2-cyanonaphthalene, for which no data exist at this level of precision. Theoretical calculations are performed to compare with the TPES for the ground electronic state of the cations. Furthermore, the different features observed in the extended TPES have been assigned to the different molecular orbitals with the help of the outer valence Green's function calculations. The present experiments also shed light on the kinetic energy distribution of the photoelectrons as a function of the incident photon energy, to describe their contribution to the photoelectric heating effect in the interstellar medium. In this context, we show how kinetic energy distributions can be obtained from our data for any given photon energy, such as the omnipresent Lyα line, or any given interstellar radiation field (ISRF). In addition, from the total ion yields, we estimate the photorates for a few ISRFs. Finally, we discuss the photodissociation of the two cyanonaphthalenes, quoting the activation energies of the dissociation channels with the help of Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus modeling. It is observed that CN substitution does not cause any appreciable change to the VUV dissociative photoionization relaxation channel.

<div> VLBA, GMRT, J0354−1340, Seyfert 1 galaxy, radio jet
<br /><br />总结:
本文报道了对J0354−1340的新的VLBA和GMRT观测结果。这是唯一已知具有100 kpc双边射电喷流的无射电安静或射电中间的窄线塞弗特1星系。VLBA观测发现了源区域向东南方向的解析尺度单边射流，并且在Karl G. Jansky大型阵列和GMRT的观测中发现了以南北方向延伸的千秒差观。通过与3.0 GHz的存档VLA Sky Survey观测和5.5 GHz的VLA C配置观测相结合，呈现了解析尺度和千秒尺度上的核心谱。在∼5 GHz以上，解析尺度辐射主导了千秒尺度辐射，并且由于同步辐射自吸收而呈现出谱线倒转。这表明了一个尺度约为∼0.04 pc的紧凑同步辐射源，与射流基底或日冕相关。在3″尺度上未解决的千秒尺度射流可能在∼5 GHz以下主导了辐射。未来的射电观测可以探索解析尺度和100 kpc尺度之间的射流结构，其方向不匹配的起源以及解析尺度射流的适当运动。尚待探讨射电安静或射电中间活跃星系中这类大尺度射流的普遍性。 <div>
We present new 1.5–8.5 GHz Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations and 0.32–1.26 GHz Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) observations of J0354−1340, which is the only known radio-quiet (RQ) or radio-intermediate (RI) narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy with a 100 kpc, two-sided radio jet. A parsec-scale, one-sided jet in the southeastern direction from the core emission is found in the VLBA observations, while the kiloparsec-scale jet observed with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and GMRT is in the south–north direction. Core spectra on parsec and kiloparsec scales are presented in combination with archival VLA Sky Survey observations at 3.0 GHz and VLA C-configuration observations at 5.5 GHz. The parsec-scale emission dominates the kiloparsec-scale emission above ∼5 GHz, and the spectrum is inverted due to synchrotron self-absorption. This indicates a compact synchrotron source with a size of ∼0.04 pc, which is associated with either the jet base or the corona. A subkiloparsec-scale jet, which is unresolved on scales of ∼3″, probably dominates the emission below ∼5 GHz. Future radio observations can explore the jet structure between the parsec and 100 kpc scales, the origin of their direction mismatch, and the parsec-scale jet proper motion. It remains to be explored how common such large-scale jets are in RQ or RI active galactic nuclei.

<div> 红移空间观测，平行平面逼近，条件矩（cmd），一阶导数的条件矩，红移空间畸变参数β，高斯线性Kaiser极限，非高斯性，Fisher预测<br /><br />总结: 本文介绍了一种新的平滑物质密度场的条件矩测度方法，可以有效地约束红移空间畸变参数β = f/b，尤其在高斯线性Kaiser极限条件下。通过使用条件矩（cmd）和条件重心（cr）联合，可以显著提高对宇宙学参数Ωm、σ8和ns的约束能力。文章还讨论了非高斯性对红移空间的影响，以及对模拟数据的一阶非高斯性贡献的影响。 通过合成各向异性高斯场的实现，验证了理论与数值结果的一致性。 <div>
Focusing on the redshift space observations with plane-parallel approximation and relying on the rotational dependency of the general definition of excursion sets, we introduce the so-called conditional moments of the first derivative (cmd) measures for the smoothed matter density field in three dimensions. We derive the perturbative expansion of cmd for the real space and redshift space where peculiar velocity disturbs the galaxies’ observed locations. Our criteria can successfully recognize the contribution of linear Kaiser and Finger-of-God effects. Our results demonstrate that the cmd measure has significant sensitivity for pristine constraining the redshift space distortion parameter β = f/b and interestingly, the associated normalized quantity in the Gaussian linear Kaiser limit has only β dependency. Implementation of the synthetic anisotropic Gaussian field approves the consistency between the theoretical and numerical results. Including the first-order contribution of non-Gaussianity perturbatively in the cmd criterion implies that the N-body simulations for the Quijote suite in the redshift space have been mildly skewed with a higher value for the threshold greater than zero. The non-Gaussianity for the perpendicular direction to the line of sight in the redshift space for smoothing scales R ≳ 20 Mpc h−1 is almost the same as in the real space. In contrast, the non-Gaussianity along the line-of-sight direction in the redshift space is magnified. The Fisher forecasts indicate a significant enhancement in constraining the cosmological parameters Ωm, σ8, and ns when using cmd + cr jointly.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了两次伴有紫外线后期相的X级太阳耀斑对电离层电流和赤道电动机的影响。研究发现，耀斑的冲击相能显著增强电离层电流，在2012年10月23日的X1.8级耀斑事件中，太阳风压力也影响了电流模式。而在2014年4月25日的X1.3级耀斑事件中，虽然太阳风压力较弱并稳定，但电流依然显著增强。同时，研究还发现，即使太阳风动态压力发生微弱变化，只有大约2nPa的变化也可能对全球电离层电流系统产生明显影响。 <div>
It is known that solar flares can affect the current system of the middle- and low-latitude ionosphere. Most earlier studies have focused on such effects during their impulsive phases. Recent studies have reported flares with a significant extreme ultraviolet (EUV) late phase, the effects of which on ionospheric currents have not yet been investigated. Here, we examine the solar quiet (Sq) currents and equatorial electrojets during two X-class flares with EUV late phases using data from more than 200 ground magnetometers. Our results indicate that the ionospheric currents could be significantly enhanced during the impulsive phase, while the effects of the EUV late phase may increase the global ionospheric currents, but are often weak and thus could be obscured by a change in solar wind conditions. In the X1.8 flare event on 2012 October 23, besides the solar flare effects, the currents were modulated by solar wind pressure. In the X1.3 flare event on 2014 April 25, the solar wind pressure was weak and stable, and the Sq currents were enhanced compared to nonflare conditions. We also found that even weak changes in the solar wind dynamic pressure, with magnitudes as low as ∼2 nPa, which are often ignored, may have an appreciable impact on the global ionospheric current system.

地球被视为一颗系外行星，研究了一种未来可能的中红外空间任务LIFE。研究利用地球的热谱数据和LIFE的噪声模型创建了模拟观测数据，通过大气检测框架表征了地球的大气，并评估了探测已知生物标志物的潜力。研究发现，地球是一个温暖适居的行星，具有大量的二氧化碳、水蒸气、臭氧和甲烷。观测地球的视角和季节变化对表征的影响较小。另外，地球大气化学物质的变化和云覆盖可能会对大气结构和痕量气体丰度的检测结果产生偏差。最后，研究指出，虽然地球的大气季节性变化不容易观测到，但未来的空间任务可以评估附近温和的类地行星是否适合居住甚至已被居住。<br /><br /> <div>
In this study, we treat Earth as an exoplanet and investigate our home planet by means of a potential future mid-infrared space mission called the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE). We combine thermal spectra from an empirical data set of disk-integrated Earth observations with a noise model for LIFE to create mock observations. We apply a state-of-the-art atmospheric retrieval framework to characterize the planet, assess the potential for detecting the known bioindicators, and investigate the impact of viewing geometry and seasonality on the characterization. Our key findings reveal that we are observing a temperate habitable planet with significant abundances of CO2, H2O, O3, and CH4. Seasonal variations in the surface and equilibrium temperature, as well as in the Bond albedo, are detectable. Furthermore, the viewing geometry and the spatially and temporally unresolved nature of our observations only have a minor impact on the characterization. Additionally, Earth’s variable abundance profiles and patchy cloud coverage can bias retrieval results for the atmospheric structure and trace-gas abundances. Lastly, the limited extent of Earth’s seasonal variations in biosignature abundances makes the direct detection of its biosphere through atmospheric seasonality unlikely. Our results suggest that LIFE could correctly identify Earth as a planet where life could thrive, with detectable levels of bioindicators, a temperate climate, and surface conditions allowing liquid surface water. Even if atmospheric seasonality is not easily observed, our study demonstrates that next generation space missions can assess whether nearby temperate terrestrial exoplanets are habitable or even inhabited.

通过对8000多个Sloan数字天文巡天DR7活动星系核（AGNs）的Hβ和Hα宽发射线的红移以及线宽进行测量，假设由中心超大质量黑洞产生的引力红移，并基于引力红移和发射线红移，我们测量了在确定超级质量黑洞质量中的维里系数。通常被认为维里系数与广线区域（BLR）中气体云对吸积辐射压力无关，仅仅与BLR的偏移效应有关。测量得到的维里系数跨度极大。在我们的样本中，绝大多数AGNs（>96％）的维里系数大于文献中通常使用的f = 1。f-修正使高吸积AGNs的百分比减少了大约100倍。f与无量纲吸积率和艾登顿比率呈正相关。Hβ和Hα的红移主要是由引力原因造成的，通过BLR的无量纲半径与红移的负相关确认了这一点。我们的研究结果表明，辐射压力力对所测维里系数的贡献是显著的，并且包含了BLR的偏移效应。需要对高吸积AGNs进行f-修正，特别是高红移类星体。f-修正将使它们的质量增加1-2个数量级，这将使在高红移处形成和增长超大质量黑洞的解释变得更加具有挑战性。<br /><br />总结: Sloan Digital Sky Survey, active galactic nuclei, virial factor, gravitational redshift, supermassive black hole <div>
Under the hypothesis of gravitational redshift induced by the central supermassive black hole and based on line widths and shifts of redward-shifted Hβ and Hα broad emission lines for more than 8000 Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7 active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we measure the virial factor in determining supermassive black hole masses. The virial factor had been believed to be independent of accretion radiation pressure on gas clouds in broad-line regions (BLRs) and only dependent on the inclination effects of BLRs. The virial factor measured spans a very large range. For the vast majority of AGNs (>96%) in our samples, the virial factor is larger than the f = 1 usually used in the literature. The f-correction makes the percent of high-accreting AGNs decrease by about 100 times. There are positive correlations of f with the dimensionless accretion rate and Eddington ratio. The redward shifts of Hβ and Hα are mainly of gravitational origin, confirmed by a negative correlation between the redward shift and the dimensionless radius of the BLR. Our results show that radiation pressure force is a significant contributor to the measured virial factor, containing the inclination effects of the BLR. The usually used values of f should be corrected for high-accreting AGNs, especially high-redshift quasars. The f-correction increases their masses by 1–2 orders of magnitude, which will make it more challenging to explain the formation and growth of supermassive black holes at high redshifts.

研究了一系列轴对称旋转磁风解决方案，旨在探讨具有强磁场、快速自转和强烈质量丢失特征的大质量白矮星（WD）合并遗迹的观测性质，这与WD J005311的推断性质相吻合。我们研究了磁层结构及对合并遗迹施加的自旋减速力矩与表面磁通Φ*、自旋角频率Ω*和质量丢失率的关系。我们确认，这种旋转磁性风序列的风特性与球形帕克风的显著偏离，其中vesc是恒星表面的逃逸速度。对于这样一个旋转磁性风序列，我们发现（i）磁重连沿赤道平面触发的准周期性质量喷发以及（ii）自旋减速力矩的比例关系。我们应用我们的结果来讨论大质量WD合并遗迹的自旋减速演化和风吹向对称性，后者可以通过使用Chandra连续观测WD J005311来探索。 <div>
We numerically construct a series of axisymmetric rotating magnetic wind solutions, aiming at exploring the observation properties of massive white dwarf (WD) merger remnants with a strong magnetic field, a fast spin, and an intense mass loss, as inferred for WD J005311. We investigate the magnetospheric structure and the resultant spin-down torque exerted to the merger remnant with respect to the surface magnetic flux Φ*, spin angular frequency Ω* and the mass-loss rate . We confirm that the wind properties for significantly deviate from those of the spherical Parker wind, where vesc is the escape velocity at stellar surface. For such a rotating magnetic wind sequence, we find (i) a quasiperiodic mass eruption triggered by magnetic reconnection along with the equatorial plane and (ii) a scaling relation for the spin-down torque . We apply our results to discuss the spin-down evolution and wind anisotropy of massive WD merger remnants, the latter of which could be probed by a successive observation of WD J005311 using Chandra.

The one consistent technique for remotely estimating the magnetic field in plasma has been Faraday rotation. It is only sensitive to the portion of the vector parallel to the propagation path. We show how to remotely detect the portion of the vector that is perpendicular using a modified measurement. Isolating this electromagnetic propagation wave mode to measure the magnetic field enables us to (i) study more about the magnetic field vector in plasma, (ii) reduce error in total electron content measurements, and (iii) discover new magnetic field information from archived data sets. The Appleton–Hartree equation is used to verify a new approach to calculating the phase change to an electromagnetic wave propagating through a plasma at frequencies larger than the gyrofrequency, the cyclotron frequency, and the upper hybrid frequency. Focusing on the perpendicular propagation modes, the simplified equation for the integrated path effect from a perpendicular magnetic field is calculated. The direction of the perpendicular component is unknown, because the magnetic field is squared. Isolating the magnetic term in the equation with dual frequency waves is shown. We also show how to eliminate the magnetic field contribution to total electron content measurements with a similar approach. In combination with Faraday rotation, the degeneracy of the magnetic field vector direction is reduced to a cone configuration.

Data collected by CHIME over 88 days in the 400–500 MHz frequency band (1.8 < z < 2.5) are formed into maps of the sky and high-pass delay filtered to suppress the foreground power, corresponding to removing cosmological scales with k∥ ≲ 0.13 Mpc−1 at the average redshift. Line-of-sight spectra to the eBOSS background quasar locations are extracted from the CHIME maps and combined with the Lyα forest flux transmission spectra to estimate the 21 cm–Lyα cross-correlation function. Fitting a simulation-derived template function to this measurement results in a 9σ detection significance. The coherent accumulation of the signal through cross-correlation is sufficient to enable a detection despite excess variance from foreground residuals ∼6–10 times brighter than the expected thermal noise level in the correlation function. These results are the highest-redshift measurement of 21 cm emission to date, and they set the stage for future 21 cm intensity mapping analyses at z > 1.8.

<div> M31, gaseous shocks, rotating stellar bar, pattern speed, gas dynamical models
<br /><br />
总结: M31的巨大气体冲击可以用旋转的恒星条来自然解释。研究使用气体动力学模型独立测量了M31的条纹速度。模拟中的重力势是根据星体光度和动力学约束的一组定制模型。研究发现，为了匹配观测到的冲击特征，需要较低的条纹速度。包括星际物理学如恒星形成和恒星反馈对冲击幅度影响不大，并且不会显著改变冲击位置。如果内部气体盘允许跟随H i和电离气体观测类似地变化倾斜度，则具有38 km s−1 kpc−1的条纹速度的气体模型可以匹配冲击特征和中央气体特征，这与星体动力学模型一致。 <div>
The large-scale gaseous shocks in the bulge of M31 can be naturally explained by a rotating stellar bar. We use gas dynamical models to provide an independent measurement of the bar pattern speed in M31. The gravitational potentials of our simulations are from a set of made-to-measure models constrained by stellar photometry and kinematics. If the inclination of the gas disk is fixed at i = 77°, we find that a low pattern speed of 16–20 km s−1 kpc−1 is needed to match the observed position and amplitude of the shock features, as shock positions are too close to the bar major axis in high Ωb models. The pattern speed can increase to 20–30 km s−1 kpc−1 if the inner gas disk has a slightly smaller inclination angle compared with the outer one. Including subgrid physics such as star formation and stellar feedback has minor effects on the shock amplitude, and does not change the shock position significantly. If the inner gas disk is allowed to follow a varying inclination similar to the H i and ionized gas observations, the gas models with a pattern speed of 38 km s−1 kpc−1, which is consistent with stellar-dynamical models, can match both the shock features and the central gas features.

<div> 巨型恒星系合并、BOSS1244、红移2.24、哈勃空间望远镜、星系形成

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章报道了BOSS1244的两个巨型恒星系BOSS1244-QG1和BOSS1244-QG2，它们位于红移2.244和2.242处，且间隔约70kpc。这显示它们可能在合并形成质量类似于本地宇宙最质量的BCG。研究还发现在BOSS1244范围内，星系的星形成活跃度随密度增加而减少，这表明BCG和它们的前体的星形成可能受到环境相关过程的影响。这拓宽了我们对附近宇宙中成熟星系团和BCG共同演化的认识。 <div>
We report the detection of a pair of massive quiescent galaxies likely in the process of merging at the center of the spectroscopically confirmed, extremely massive protocluster BOSS1244 at z = 2.24 ± 0.02. These galaxies, BOSS1244-QG1 and BOSS1244-QG2, were detected with Hubble Space Telescope grism slitless spectroscopic observations. These two quiescent galaxies are among the brightest member galaxies, with z = 2.223–2.255 in BOSS1244, and reside at redshifts z = 2.244 and z = 2.242, with a half-light radius of 6.76 ± 0.50 kpc and 2.72 ± 0.16 kpc, respectively. BOSS1244-QG1 and BOSS1244-QG2 are separated by a projected distance of about 70 physical kpc, implying that the two galaxies likely merge to form a massive brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) with size and mass similar to the most massive BCGs in the local Universe. We thus infer that BCG formation through dry major mergers may happen earlier than the full assembly of a cluster core, which broadens our previous understanding of the coevolution of mature galaxy clusters and BCGs in the nearby Universe. Moreover, we find a strong density–star formation relation over a scale of ∼18 comoving Mpc in BOSS1244, i.e., star formation activity decreases as density increases, implying that the quenching of star formation in BCGs and their progenitors is likely governed by environment-related processes before the virialization of the cluster core.

总结: 
这篇文章主要研究了在磁化湍流分子云核中的非对称原恒星流的形成和早期演化。他们发现在低质量原恒星系统中，即使只有一个，也会形成单极流。单极流是在磁场较弱的云核中形成的，而比例参数μ为8和16。同时他们还发现了原恒星火箭效应，类似于火箭的发射和推进。单极流将原恒星系统从中心密集区域抛射到云核的外部区域，并且由于其抛射产生的动压抑制了额外新的流的驱动。相反，弯曲的双极流是在比例参数μ为4的磁化云核中形成的。父云核的磁场与湍动能的比例可能在形成非对称原恒星流中发挥关键作用。 <div>
Observed protostellar outflows exhibit a variety of asymmetrical features, including remarkable unipolar outflows and bending outflows. Revealing the formation and early evolution of such asymmetrical protostellar outflows, especially the unipolar outflows, is essential for a better understanding of the star and planet formation because they can dramatically change the mass accretion and angular momentum transport to the protostars and protoplanetary disks. Here we perform three-dimensional nonideal magnetohydrodynamics simulations to investigate the formation and early evolution of the asymmetrical protostellar outflows in magnetized turbulent isolated molecular cloud cores. We find, for the first time to our knowledge, that the unipolar outflow forms even in the single low-mass protostellar system. The results show that the unipolar outflow is driven in the weakly magnetized cloud cores with the dimensionless mass-to-flux ratios of μ = 8 and 16. Furthermore, we find the protostellar rocket effect of the unipolar outflow, which is similar to the launch and propulsion of a rocket. The unipolar outflow ejects the protostellar system from the central dense region to the outer region of the parent cloud core, and the ram pressure caused by its ejection suppresses the driving of additional new outflows. In contrast, the bending bipolar outflow is driven in the moderately magnetized cloud core with μ = 4. The ratio of the magnetic to turbulent energies of a parent cloud core may play a key role in the formation of asymmetrical protostellar outflows.

<div> 关键词: 分子气体外流, 恒星形成星系, OH吸收, [C ii]辐射, 气体动力学<br />
<br />总结: 本研究分析了通过Gravitationally Lensed Dusty Star-forming Galaxies (DSFGs) 对分子气体外流的观测数据，发现通过空间集成光谱的统计分析结果仅有一个源展现了OH吸收比[C ii]辐射更蓝移的特征，但通过通道图的信号分析发现了所有五个源中都存在OH吸收的不同动力学成分表现，这些成分可能追踪着旋转盘中的气体。研究指出了未来观测中需要改进大气吸收线的修正和更准确地测量源的连续谱的方法。 <div>
Galactic-scale outflows of molecular gas from star-forming galaxies constitute the most direct evidence for the regulation of star formation. In the early Universe (z > 4), such outflows have recently been inferred from gravitationally lensed dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) based on ubiquitous detections of OH absorption extending to more blueshifted velocities than [C ii] or CO emission in spatially integrated spectra. Because these lines are redshifted to submillimeter wavelengths, such measurements require careful corrections for atmospheric absorption lines, and a proper accounting of sometimes large variations in measurement uncertainties over these lines. Taking these factors into consideration, we reanalyze OH and [C ii] data taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array for five sources where such data are available, of which four were categorised as exhibiting outflows. Based on their spatially integrated spectra alone, we find statistically significant (≥3σ) OH absorption more blueshifted than [C ii] emission in only one source. By contrast, searching channel maps for signals diluted below the detection threshold in spatially integrated spectra, we find evidence for a separate kinematic component in OH absorption in all five sources in the form of (i) more blueshifted OH absorption than [C ii] emission and/or (ii) a component in OH absorption exhibiting a different spatio-kinematic pattern than in [C ii] emission, the latter presumably tracing gas in a rotating disk. Providing a more complete and accurate assessment of molecular outflows in gravitationally lensed DSFGs, we suggest methods to assess the precision of corrections for atmospheric absorption better and to measure the source continuum in future observations more accurately.

We report timing and spectral studies of the high-mass X-ray binary 4U 1700-37 using Insight-HXMT observations carried out in 2020 during its out-of-eclipse state. We found significant variations in flux on a timescale of kilo-seconds, while the hardness (count rate ratio between 10–30 keV and 2–10 keV) remains relatively stable. No evident pulsations were found over a frequency range of 10−3–2000 Hz. During the spectral analysis, for the first time, we took the configuration of different Insight-HXMT detectors’ orientations into account, which allows us to obtain reliable results even if stable contamination exists in the field of view. We found that the spectrum could be well described by some phenomenological models that are commonly used in accreting pulsars (e.g., a power law with a high energy cutoff) in the energy range of 2–100 keV. We found hints of cyclotron absorption features around ∼16 keV or/and ∼50 keV.

Measuring the mass–radius relation of individual white dwarfs is an empirically challenging task that has been performed for only a few dozen stars. We measure the white dwarf mass–radius relation using the gravitational redshifts and radii of 135 white dwarfs in wide binaries with main-sequence companions. We obtain the radial velocities of these systems using the main-sequence companion, and subtract these Doppler redshifts from the white dwarfs’ apparent motions, isolating their gravitational redshifts. We use Gaia data to calculate the surface temperatures and radii of these white dwarfs, thereby deriving an empirical gravitational redshift–radius relation. This work demonstrates the utility of low-resolution Galactic surveys to measure the white dwarf equation of state. Our results are consistent with theoretical models, and represent the largest sample of individual white dwarf gravitational redshift measurements to date.

<br /><br />总结: 本文报告了IXPE对BL Lac型类星体1ES 1959+650的X射线偏振观测结果。在不同时间段的观测中，得出了不同的偏振度数据，同时结合光学偏振度的测量结果，对结果进行了讨论，并提出了可能的解释和物理机制。 <div>
Observations of linear polarization in the 2–8 keV energy range with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) explore the magnetic field geometry and dynamics of the regions generating nonthermal radiation in relativistic jets of blazars. These jets, particularly in blazars whose spectral energy distribution peaks at X-ray energies, emit X-rays via synchrotron radiation from high-energy particles within the jet. IXPE observations of the X-ray-selected BL Lac–type blazar 1ES 1959+650 on 2022 May 3–4 showed a significant linear polarization degree of Πx = 8.0% ± 2.3% at an electric-vector position angle ψx = 123° ± 8°. However, on 2022 June 9–12, only an upper limit of Πx ≤ 5.1% could be derived (at the 99% confidence level). The degree of optical polarization at that time, ΠO ∼ 5%, is comparable to the X-ray measurement. We investigate possible scenarios for these findings, including temporal and geometrical depolarization effects. Unlike some other X-ray-selected BL Lac objects, there is no significant chromatic dependence of the measured polarization in 1ES 1959+650, and its low X-ray polarization may be attributed to turbulence in the jet flow with dynamical timescales shorter than 1 day.

The nature of energy generation, transport, and effective dissipation responsible for maintaining a hot solar upper atmosphere is still elusive. The Poynting flux is a vital parameter for describing the direction and magnitude of the energy flow, which is mainly used in solar physics for estimating the upward energy generated by photospheric plasma motion. This study presents a pioneering 3D mapping of the magnetic energy transport within a numerically simulated solar atmosphere. By calculating the Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent of the energy velocity, defined as the ratio of the Poynting flux to the magnetic energy density, we precisely identify the sources and destinations of the magnetic energy flow throughout the solar atmosphere. This energy mapping reveals the presence of transport barriers in the lower atmosphere, restricting the amount of magnetic energy from the photosphere reaching the chromosphere and corona. Interacting kinematic and magnetic vortices create energy channels, breaking through these barriers and allowing three times more energy input from photospheric motions to reach the upper atmosphere than before the vortices formed. The vortex system also substantially alters the energy mapping, acting as a source and deposition of energy, leading to localized energy concentration. Furthermore, our results show that the energy is transported following a vortical motion: the Poynting flux vortex. In regions where these vortices coexist, they favor conditions for energy dissipation through ohmic and viscous heating, since they naturally create large gradients in the magnetic and velocity fields over small spatial scales. Hence, the vortex system promotes local plasma heating, leading to temperatures around a million Kelvins.

The investigation of mechanisms responsible for the heating of cold solar wind electrons around the Earth’s bow shock is an important problem in heliospheric plasma physics because such heating is vitally required to run the shock drift acceleration at the bow shock. The prospective mechanism for electron heating is magnetic pumping, which considers electron adiabatic (compressional) heating by ultralow-frequency waves and simultaneous scattering by high-frequency fluctuations. Existing models of magnetic pumping have operated with external sources of such fluctuations. In this study, we generalize these models by introducing the self-consistent electron scattering by whistler-mode waves generated due to the anisotropic electron heating process. We consider an electron population captured within a magnetic trap created by ultralow-frequency waves. Periodical adiabatic heating and cooling of this population drives the generation of whistler-mode waves scattering electrons in the pitch-angle space. The combination of adiabatic heating and whistler-driven scattering provides electron acceleration and the formation of a suprathermal electron population that can further participate in the shock drift acceleration.

总结: 
本文研究了宇宙中的星系结构和环境对星系停止形成新恒星的影响。在低密度环境中，发现了一个特征的表面密度Σ1 kpc，超过这个密度会触发星系停止形成新恒星，而这一现象几乎不受质量的影响。在高密度环境中，对红移高于1的星系和低密度环境中的星系几乎没有区别，但在红移小于1时，低质量星系的停止形成新恒星现象与质量的关联性增强，这是由于更强烈的环境影响。另外，发现停止形成新恒星的现象在红移较低时显示出强烈的演化，可能是由于在高红移时星系的暗物质含量和气体含量更高，因此需要更强的黑洞能量来停止新恒星的形成。同时，在较低红移时，角动量的抑制效果也更加显著，这与来自活动星系核的物质反馈效应相辅相成。 <div>
In a previous work, we investigated the structural and environmental dependence on quenching in the nearby universe. In this work, we extend our investigations to higher redshifts by combining galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and The FourStar Galaxy Evolution surveys. In low density, we find a characteristic Σ1 kpc above which the quenching is initiated as indicated by their population-averaged color. shows only a weak mass dependency at all redshifts, which suggests that the internal quenching process is more related to the physics that acts in the central region of galaxies. In high density, for galaxies at z > 1 is almost indistinguishable from their low-density counterparts. At z < 1, for low-mass galaxies becomes progressively strongly mass dependent, which is due to the increasingly stronger environmental effects at lower redshifts. in low density shows strong redshift evolution with ∼1 dex decrement from z = 2.5–0. It is likely that at a given stellar mass, the host halo is on average more massive and gas-rich at higher redshifts; hence, a higher level of integrated energy from a more massive black hole (BH) is required to quench. As the halo evolves from the cold to hot accretion phase at lower redshifts, the gas is shock-heated and becomes more vulnerable to the feedback processes from active galactic nucleus as predicted by theory. Meanwhile, angular momentum quenching also becomes more effective at low redshifts, which complements a lower level of integrated energy from the BH to quench.

IGR J17091–3624在NICER/NuSTAR时代首次爆发，数据显示其从硬态到中间态再转变为软态，出现了两种不同类别的心跳变化，同时伴随着光谱特征的变化。在软态时，只有伴随着心跳变化才能检测到高度电离的铁吸收线。这一发现表明IGR J17091–3624可以被视为GRS 1915+105和“正常” BHXBs之间的桥梁，因为它在传统和奇特的BHXB行为之间变换。文章讨论了吸收物质和奇特变化的物理性质。 <br /><br />总结: 黑洞X射线双星IGR J17091–3624显示出了在软态时伴随着奇特变化的高度电离的铁吸收线，这表明它可能是GRS 1915+105和“正常” BHXBs之间的过渡形态。 <div>
While the standard X-ray variability of black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs) is stochastic and noisy, there are two known BHXBs that exhibit exotic “heartbeat”-like variability in their lightcurves: GRS 1915+105 and IGR J17091–3624. In 2022, IGR J17091–3624 went into outburst for the first time in the NICER/NuSTAR era. These exquisite data allow us to simultaneously track the exotic variability and the corresponding spectral features with unprecedented detail. We find that as in typical BHXBs, the outburst began in the hard state, then continued in the intermediate state, but then transitioned to an exotic soft state, where we identify two types of heartbeat-like variability (Class V and a new Class X). The flux energy spectra show a broad iron emission line due to relativistic reflection when there is no exotic variability, and absorption features from highly ionized iron when the source exhibits exotic variability. Whether absorption lines from highly ionized iron are detected in IGR J17091–3624 is not determined by the spectral state alone, but rather is determined by the presence of exotic variability; in a soft spectral state, absorption lines are only detected along with exotic variability. Our finding indicates that IGR J17091–3624 can be seen as a bridge between the most peculiar BHXB GRS 1915+105 and “normal” BHXBs, because it alternates between the conventional and exotic behaviors of BHXBs. We discuss the physical nature of the absorbing material and exotic variability in light of this new legacy data set.

<div> RS CVn-type stars, CMEs, II Pegasi, flares, spectroscopic observation

RS CVn型星，日冕质量抛射（CMEs），II Pegasi，耀斑，分光观测。该研究报告了使用高分辨率光谱观测捕获了II Pegasi（II Peg）上可能存在CME或色球凝结的情况。观测期间检测到两次耀斑，耀斑的能量下限分别为1033 erg和1034 erg。通过平均光谱相减，Hα残留光谱在耀斑期间表现出红移不对称性，而在第二次耀斑期间观察到了远红移的额外发射组分，其大速度显示了可能是一个日珥喷发事件。CME的质量估计为0.83–1.48 × 1020 g，动能为0.76–1.15 × 1035 erg，不足够与从太阳事件外推的动能相媲美。最后，在没有耀斑发生时，通过合成光谱相减得到了残留的Hα轮廓，其中有一个蓝移宽成分与Hα活跃特征相关。 <div>
Stellar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) have recently attracted much attention for their impacts on stellar evolution and surrounding exoplanets. RS CVn-type stars could produce large flares, and therefore may have frequent CMEs. Here we report the capture of a possible CME or chromospheric condensation on the RS CVn-type star II Pegasi (II Peg) using high-resolution spectroscopic observation. Two flares were detected during the observation, and the low limits of the flare energies are of the order of 1033 erg and 1034 erg, respectively. Using mean spectrum subtraction, the Hα residual shows red asymmetry during the flares, and the redshifted broad emission components are probably caused by chromospheric condensation or coronal rain. Moreover, a far redshifted extra emission component with a high bulk velocity of 429 km s−1 was observed during the second flare and is probably due to a prominence eruption. The velocity greatly exceeds the star’s escape velocity, which means that this eruption can develop into a CME. The CME mass is estimated to be 0.83–1.48 × 1020 g, which is slightly larger than the value expected from solar flare-CME extrapolation. The kinetic energy of CME, derived to be 0.76–1.15 × 1035 erg, is less than the kinetic energy extrapolated from solar events. Additionally, we could not completely rule out the possibility of chromospheric condensation resulting in the far redshifted extra emission. Finally, there is a blueshifted broad component in the subtracted Hα profile derived using synthesized spectral subtraction when no flare happened, and its behavior is associated with the Hα activity features.

<br /><br />总结: 本研究利用安装在大毫米望远镜上的2mm接收器系统B4R获取了奥赖恩KL区域DCN（J = 2 − 1）和DCO+（J = 2 − 1）线的排放图。在奥赖恩KL热核位置发现DCN排放峰值，但未检测到DCO+排放。而DCO+排放则在热核的西侧有增强，这个区域受到Trapezium星团中OB大质量恒星UV辐射的很好的遮蔽。研究还推导了三个代表性位置的DCN/DCO+丰度比值，发现VLSR约为7.5–8.7 km s−1的气体组分丰度比较低，约为4–6，而VLSR约为9.2–11.6 km s−1的气体组分丰度比较高，约为22–30。结合化学模型发现，观察到的DCN/DCO+丰度比差异可以通过不同密度来解释。 <div>
We present emission maps ( scale, corresponding to 0.18 pc) of the DCN (J = 2 − 1) and DCO+ (J = 2 − 1) lines in the 2 mm band toward the Orion KL region obtained with the 2 mm receiver system named B4R installed on the Large Millimeter Telescope. The DCN emission shows a peak at the Orion KL hot core position, whereas no DCO+ emission has been detected there. The DCO+ emission shows enhancement at the west side of the hot core, which is well shielded from the UV radiation from OB massive stars in the Trapezium cluster. We have derived the abundance ratio of DCN/DCO+ at three representative positions where both species have been detected. The gas components with VLSR ≈ 7.5–8.7 km s−1 are associated with low abundance ratios of ∼4–6, whereas much higher abundance ratios (∼22–30) are derived for the gas components with VLSR ≈ 9.2–11.6 km s−1. We have compared the observed abundance ratio to our chemical models and found that the observed differences in the DCN/DCO+ abundance ratios are explained by different densities.

<title>Deep Chandra Observations of A2495: A Possible Sloshing-regulated Feedback Cycle in a Triple-offset Galaxy Cluster</title>

<div> 关键词: A2495, Chandra observations, ICM, BCG, AGN feedback

总结: 
A2495是一个研究对象，通过深入的Chandra观测发现了ICM、BCG和Hα发光气体之间的偏移。新的数据确认了X射线发射峰值距离BCG约6.2 kpc，距离Hα发射峰值约3.9 kpc。研究发现了ICM中两代X射线空腔，由中央射电星系活动引起。AGN的能量足以抵消ICM冷却的辐射损失，表明A2495仍然具有有效的反馈循环。偏移很可能是由ICM的搅动引起的，这得到了螺旋结构和在距离中心东部约58 kpc处可能存在的冷锋的支持。最后，研究发现两代X射线空腔之间的喷发间隔与动态搅动的时间尺度相当，因此推测搅动可能会调节A2495中AGN反馈的时间尺度。 <div>
We present the analysis of new, deep Chandra observations (130 ks) of the galaxy cluster A2495. This object is known for the presence of a triple offset between the peaks of the intracluster medium (ICM), the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), and the warm gas glowing in Hα line. The new Chandra data confirm that the X-ray emission peak is located at a distance of ∼6.2 kpc from the BCG, and at ∼3.9 kpc from the Hα emission peak. Moreover, we identify two generations of X-ray cavities in the ICM, likely inflated by the central radio galaxy activity. Through a detailed morphological and spectral analysis, we determine that the power of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) outbursts (Pcav = 4.7 ± 1.3 × 1043 erg s−1) is enough to counterbalance the radiative losses from ICM cooling (Lcool = 5.7 ± 0.1 × 1043 erg s−1). This indicates that, despite a fragmented cooling core, A2495 still harbors an effective feedback cycle. We argue that the offsets are most likely caused by sloshing of the ICM, supported by the presence of spiral structures and a probable cold front in the gas at ∼58 kpc east of the center. Ultimately, we find that the outburst interval between the two generations of X-ray cavities is of the order of the dynamical sloshing timescale, as already hinted from the previous Chandra snapshot. We thus speculate that sloshing may be able to regulate the timescales of AGN feedback in A2495, by periodically fueling the central AGN.

在SDSS J1531+3414星系团中，两个中心星系正在进行重大的合并，周围环绕着一条由19个年轻恒星超星团组成的链状结构。新的Chandra X射线成像揭示了迅速冷却的热（T∼106K）星团内气体，其中两个“翼”形成了一个凹凸不平的密度不连续，靠近冷核心的边缘。 LOFAR 144 MHz观测揭示了与“翼”引人注目地对齐的扩散射电发射，这表明“翼”实际上是一个巨大的X射线超空洞的开口。北部的超空洞处，GMOS探测到包围恒星超星团的温暖（T∼104K）电离气体，但与南部中心星系相比，呈现出高达+800 km s−1的红移。阿塔卡马大型毫米/亚毫米阵列探测到一个类似红移的∼1010M⊙的冷（T∼102K）分子气体储库，但它与年轻恒星相偏移约1-3千秒差距。我们提出，多相气体源自被X射线超空洞卷入的低熵气体，将年轻恒星和分子气体之间的偏移归因于星系团内湍流运动，并建议潮汐相互作用刺激了“串珠状”星形成形态。<br /><br />总结: 在SDSS J1531+3414星系团中发现了两个中心星系的重大合并以及周围的年轻星团链结构，Chandra X射线成像揭示了迅速冷却的热星团内气体和超空洞，LOFAR观测揭示了与超空洞对齐的扩散射电发射，GMOS和阿塔卡马大型毫米/亚毫米阵列观测也揭示了一系列相关现象，这些发现为研究合并、AGN反馈和星形成的相互作用提供了重要实验室。 <div>
With two central galaxies engaged in a major merger and a remarkable chain of 19 young stellar superclusters wound around them in projection, the galaxy cluster SDSS J1531+3414 (z = 0.335) offers an excellent laboratory to study the interplay between mergers, active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, and star formation. New Chandra X-ray imaging reveals rapidly cooling hot (T ∼ 106 K) intracluster gas, with two “wings” forming a concave density discontinuity near the edge of the cool core. LOFAR 144 MHz observations uncover diffuse radio emission strikingly aligned with the “wings,” suggesting that the “wings” are actually the opening to a giant X-ray supercavity. The steep radio emission is likely an ancient relic of one of the most energetic AGN outbursts observed, with 4pV > 1061 erg. To the north of the supercavity, GMOS detects warm (T ∼ 104 K) ionized gas that enshrouds the stellar superclusters but is redshifted up to +800 km s−1 with respect to the southern central galaxy. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array detects a similarly redshifted ∼1010M⊙ reservoir of cold (T ∼ 102 K) molecular gas, but it is offset from the young stars by ∼1–3 kpc. We propose that the multiphase gas originated from low-entropy gas entrained by the X-ray supercavity, attribute the offset between the young stars and the molecular gas to turbulent intracluster gas motions, and suggest that tidal interactions stimulated the “beads-on-a-string” star formation morphology.

Multi-messenger astrophysics has produced a wealth of data with much more to come in the future. This enormous data set will reveal new insights into the physics of core-collapse supernovae, neutron star mergers, and many other objects where it is actually possible, if not probable, that new physics is in operation. To tease out different possibilities, we will need to analyze signals from photons, neutrinos, gravitational waves, and chemical elements. This task is made all the more difficult when it is necessary to evolve the neutrino component of the radiation field and associated quantum-mechanical property of flavor in order to model the astrophysical system of interest—a numerical challenge that has not been addressed to this day. In this work, we take a step in this direction by adopting the technique of angular-integrated moments with a truncated tower of dynamical equations and a closure, convolving the flavor-transformation with spatial transport to evolve the neutrino radiation quantum field. We show that moments capture the dynamical features of fast flavor instabilities in a variety of systems, although our technique is by no means a universal blueprint for solving fast flavor transformation. To evaluate the effectiveness of our moment results, we compare to a more precise particle-in-cell method. Based on our results, we propose areas for improvement and application to complementary techniques in the future.

<div> 高红移星系，JWST观测，光度选择，尺寸-星团质量关系，星系结构演化。<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用JWST的观测数据，在高红移星系中鉴定了341个星系，并在文献中找到109个星系的光谱红移测量。研究发现，这些高红移星系的UV大小-恒星质量关系与z∼3的星系相似，但整体尺寸要小约0.7 dex。此外，发现这些星系的平均大小演化速率比已有文献中的推测值更缓慢。一部分星系呈现出较小的尺寸，但具有极高的星团形成表面密度，这与当地星系样本中的特征不同。此外，观测表明这些星系中没有超大质量黑洞的持续吸积。最后发现，这些高红移星系的UV和光学尺寸相当。这些结果表明早期星系可能是从内向外构建结构，尚未表现出低红移时期明显的颜色梯度。 <div>
We present a comprehensive search and analysis of high-redshift galaxies in a suite of nine public JWST extragalactic fields taken in Cycle 1, covering a total effective search area of . Through conservative (8σ) photometric selection, we identify 341 galaxies at 5 < z < 14, with 109 having spectroscopic redshift measurements from the literature, including recent JWST NIRSpec observations. Our regression analysis reveals that the rest-frame UV size–stellar mass relation follows , similar to that of star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 3, but scaled down in size by ∼0.7 dex. We find a much slower rate for the average size evolution over the redshift range, Reff ∝ (1 + z)−0.4±0.2, than that derived in the literature. A fraction (∼13%) of our sample galaxies are marginally resolved even in the NIRCam imaging (≲100 pc), located at ≳1.5σ below the derived size–mass slope. These compact sources exhibit a high star formation surface density ΣSFR > 10 M⊙ yr−1 kpc−2, a range in which only <0.01% of the local star-forming galaxy sample is found. For those with available NIRSpec data, no evidence of ongoing supermassive black hole accretion is observed. A potential explanation for the observed high [O iii]-to-Hβ ratios could be high shock velocities, likely originating within intense star-forming regions characterized by high ΣSFR. Lastly, we find that the rest-frame UV and optical sizes of our sample are comparable. Our results are consistent with these early galaxies building up their structures inside out and being yet to exhibit the strong color gradient seen at lower redshift.

EVQs是极端变异类星系核，研究了它们的光谱特性，发现了“亮时更蓝”的趋势，表明EVQs的光谱变化与普通类星体和活动星系核相一致。此外，在EVQs的Mg ii和C iv谱线中检测到了明显的内在Baldwin效应（即在各个活跃星系核中，在较高的连续光流下，线等效宽度较小）。然而，在宽Hβ线上并未发现系统的内在Baldwin效应，可能是由于较长波长处强烈的宿主污染。此外，通过比较EVQs的iBeff斜率与文献中的变样类星体，发现变样类星体很可能是EVQs的一个偏倚子群，而不是一个截然不同的星系核种群。最后，发现Hβ、Mg ii和C iv的宽线呼吸没有显著的变化，表明类星体的宽线呼吸可能会在较长时间尺度（约3000天）内消失。<br /><br />总结:EVQs的光谱显示出“亮时更蓝”的趋势，同时在Mg ii和C iv谱线中检测到了内在的Baldwin效应。变样类星体很可能是EVQs的一个偏斜子群。此外，在较长时间尺度内，类星体的宽线呼吸可能会消失。 <div>
We previously built a sample of 14,012 extremely variable quasars (EVQs) based on Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Pan-STARRS1 photometric observations. In this work we present the spectral fitting to their SDSS spectra and study the spectral variation in 1259 EVQs with multiepoch SDSS spectra (after prudently excluding spectra with potentially unreliable spectroscopic photometry). We find a clear “bluer-when-brighter” trend in EVQs, consistent with previous findings of normal quasars and active galactic nuclei. We detect significant intrinsic Baldwin effect (iBeff, i.e., smaller line equivalent width at higher continuum flux in individual active galactic nuclei) in the broad Mg ii and C iv lines of EVQs. Meanwhile, no systematical iBeff is found for the broad Hβ line, which could be attributed to strong host contamination at longer wavelengths. Remarkably, by comparing the iBeff slope of EVQs with archived changing-look quasars, we show that the changing-look quasars identified in the literature are most likely a biased (due to its definition) subpopulation of EVQs, rather than a distinct population of quasars. We also found no significant broad line breathing of Hβ, Mg ii, or C iv, suggesting the broad line breathing in quasars may disappear at longer timescales (∼3000 days).

We present Chandra ACIS-S imaging spectroscopy results of the extended (1.″5–8″, 300–1600 pc) hard X-ray emission of NGC 5728, the host galaxy of a Compton-thick active galactic nucleus. We find spectrally and spatially resolved features in the Fe Kα complex (5.0–7.5 keV) redward and blueward of the neutral Fe line at 6.4 keV in the extended narrow-line region bicone. A simple phenomenological fit of a power law plus Gaussians gives a significance of 5.4σ and 3.7σ for the red and blue wings, respectively. Fits to a suite of physically consistent models confirm a significance of ≥3σ for the red wing. The significance of the blue wing may be diminished by the presence of rest-frame highly ionized Fe xxv and Fe xxvi lines (1.4σ–3.7σ range). A detailed investigation of the Chandra ACIS-S point-spread function and comparison with the observed morphology demonstrates that these red and blue wings are radially extended (∼5″, ∼1 kpc) along the optical bicone axis. If the wing emission is due solely to redshifted and blueshifted high-velocity neutral Fe Kα, then the implied line-of-sight velocities are +/− ∼0.1c, and their fluxes are consistent with being equal. A symmetric high-velocity outflow is then a viable explanation. This outflow has deprojected velocities ∼100 times larger than the outflows detected in optical spectroscopic studies, potentially dominating the kinetic feedback power.

We consider small-scale jetlike events that might make the solar wind, as has been suggested in recent studies. We show that the events referred to as “coronal jets” and as “jetlets” both fall on a power-law distribution that also includes large-scale eruptions and spicule-sized features; all of the jetlike events could contribute to the solar wind. Based on imaging and magnetic field data, it is plausible that many or most of these events might form by the same mechanism: Magnetic flux cancelation produces small-scale flux ropes, often containing a cool-material minifilament. This minifilament/flux rope erupts and reconnects with adjacent open coronal field, along which “plasma jets” flow and contribute to the solar wind. The erupting flux ropes can contain twist that is transferred to the open field, and these become Alfvénic pulses that form magnetic switchbacks, providing an intrinsic connection between switchbacks and the production of the solar wind.

<div> 关键词: 出流, 吸收线类型, 宿主星系, 恒星形成率, 演化阶段 <br />
总结: 该研究利用Sloan Digital Sky Survey类星体目录，使用[O II]和[Ne V]发射线的流量比作为指标，比较了显示不同出流吸收线类型的类星体的宿主星系内的恒星形成率。研究发现，LoMini-BAL类星体的恒星形成率与LoNAL类星体相当，略低于LoBAL类星体，但明显高于HiBAL类星体。此外，HiMini-BAL类星体的恒星形成率与HiNAL或非吸收线（Non-abs）类星体相似，但明显高于HiBAL类星体。研究结果表明，不同的吸收线类型可能反映了类星体的演化阶段，提出了一个综合的演化顺序：LoBAL逐渐演变成LoMini-BAL/LoNAL，然后进化成HiBAL，最终形成HiMini-BAL/HiNAL/Non-abs。与此同时，在类星体的宿主星系中，恒星形成率在LoNAL阶段朝向结束时明显下降，在HiMini-BAL阶段之前再次恢复。 <div>
It is commonly accepted that outflows from the central regions of quasars play a substantial role in regulating the global properties of the host galaxy. These outflows are typically detected through blueshifted absorption lines. However, the question remains whether outflows observed with different absorption line types indeed reflect the same environmental or evolutionary stage of the host galaxy. In this study, we use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasar catalog and employ the flux ratio of [O II] and [Ne V] emission lines as indicators to compare star formation rates (SFRs) within host galaxies of quasars exhibiting various outflow absorption line types: low-ionization broad absorption line (LoBAL), low-ionization Mini-BAL (LoMini-BAL), low-ionization narrow absorption line (LoNAL), high-ionization broad absorption line (HiBAL), high-ionization Mini-BAL (HiMini-BAL), and high-ionization narrow absorption line (HiNAL). Our findings indicate that the SFR of LoMini-BAL quasars is comparable to that of LoNAL quasars, somewhat less than that of LoBAL quasars, but markedly greater than that of HiBAL quasars. Furthermore, the SFR of HiMini-BAL quasars mirrors that of HiNAL or Non-abs (no associated absorption lines) quasars, but is significantly higher than that of HiBAL quasars. If we consider that differing absorption line types are indicative of the quasar evolution stage, our results propose an inclusive evolution sequence: LoBALs evolve into LoMini-BALs/LoNALs, then progress to HiBALs, and ultimately morph into HiMini-BALs/HiNALs/Non-abs. Concomitantly, the SFR within the host galaxies of quasars appears to decline noticeably nearing the LoNAL phase’s end and rejuvenates before the HiMini-BAL phase.

JWST观测发现了在高红移处存在大量亮度较高的星系，这对流行的星系形成模型可能构成严峻挑战。研究人员使用了蓝色倾斜功率谱（BTPS）模型，进行了宇宙学N体模拟，推导出暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质等暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质暗物质。 BTPS模型复现了z=7-9处观测到的星团质量密度，从而缓解了星系形成理论和最近JWST观测之间的紧张关系。当前宇宙的大尺度结构在小尺度功率谱的修改下基本上没有受到影响。通过改变小尺度功率谱的斜率进行了系统性研究，并从一系列高红移星系观测中推导出BTPS模型的限制。 <br /><br />总结: JWST观测发现高红移星系丰富，挑战了星系形成模型；使用BTPS模型进行了N体模拟，复现了高红移星系的质量密度；BTPS模型缓解了星系形成理论与JWST观测之间的紧张关系；大尺度结构基本不受小尺度功率谱修改影响；通过系统研究得出BTPS模型的观测限制。 <div>
Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discovered unexpectedly abundant luminous galaxies at high redshift, posing possibly a severe challenge to popular galaxy formation models. We study early structure formation in a cosmological model with a blue, tilted power spectrum (BTPS) given by with ms > 1 at small length scales. We run a set of cosmological N-body simulations and derive the abundance of dark matter halos and galaxies under simplified assumptions on star formation efficiency. The enhanced small-scale power allows rapid nonlinear structure formation at z > 7, and galaxies with stellar mass exceeding 1010M⊙ can be formed by z = 9. Because of frequent mergers, the structure of galaxies and galaxy groups appears clumpy. The BTPS model reproduces the observed stellar mass density at z = 7–9, and thus eases the claimed tension between galaxy formation theory and recent JWST observations. The large-scale structure of the present-day Universe is largely unaffected by the modification of the small-scale power spectrum. We conduct a systematic study by varying the slope of the small-scale power spectrum to derive constraints on the BTPS model from a set of observations of high-redshift galaxies.

<div> CMB lensing, ACT DR6, power spectrum, constraints, structure growth
总结:
本文介绍了关于宇宙微波背景(CMB)透镜效应的新测量结果，使用了Atacama宇宙学望远镜（ACT）数据发布6（DR6）的CMB数据集。利用新的方法得出了CMB透镜功率谱的振幅，提供了对宇宙结构增长幅度的约束。该研究结果与Planck或ACT DR4 + WMAP CMB功率谱测量的ΛCDM模型约束完全一致，表明了在红移z∼0.5–5范围内并无宇宙结构振幅抑制的证据。通过分析大量的空测、一致性检验以及系统误差评估，确保了结果的可靠性和稳健性。同时，该测量结果还提供了关于大尺度结构增长的独立信息，不依赖于Planck或星系调查数据。 <div>
We present new measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing over 9400 deg2 of the sky. These lensing measurements are derived from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6) CMB data set, which consists of five seasons of ACT CMB temperature and polarization observations. We determine the amplitude of the CMB lensing power spectrum at 2.3% precision (43σ significance) using a novel pipeline that minimizes sensitivity to foregrounds and to noise properties. To ensure that our results are robust, we analyze an extensive set of null tests, consistency tests, and systematic error estimates and employ a blinded analysis framework. Our CMB lensing power spectrum measurement provides constraints on the amplitude of cosmic structure that do not depend on Planck or galaxy survey data, thus giving independent information about large-scale structure growth and potential tensions in structure measurements. The baseline spectrum is well fit by a lensing amplitude of Alens = 1.013 ± 0.023 relative to the Planck 2018 CMB power spectra best-fit ΛCDM model and Alens = 1.005 ± 0.023 relative to the ACT DR4 + WMAP best-fit model. From our lensing power spectrum measurement, we derive constraints on the parameter combination of from ACT DR6 CMB lensing alone and when combining ACT DR6 and Planck NPIPE CMB lensing power spectra. These results are in excellent agreement with ΛCDM model constraints from Planck or ACT DR4 + WMAP CMB power spectrum measurements. Our lensing measurements from redshifts z ∼ 0.5–5 are thus fully consistent with ΛCDM structure growth predictions based on CMB anisotropies probing primarily z ∼ 1100. We find no evidence for a suppression of the amplitude of cosmic structure at low redshifts.

<div> CMB, gravitational lensing, cosmological constraints, ΛCDM, neutrino<br />
总结:<br />
本研究利用通过ACT进行的CMB测量重建了一个重力透镜质量图，涵盖了9400平方度。结合声学振荡和宇宙核合成的测量结果，得出了聚集幅度σ8 = 0.819 ± 0.015和哈勃常数H0 = (68.3 ± 1.1) km s−1 Mpc−1。这些测量结果与Planck CMB镜头的联合约束一致。研究还对KiDS、DES和HSC的星系调查结果进行了重新评估，发现S8值均低于ACT+Planck镜头的水平。此外，研究还限制了中微子质量∑mν < 0.13 eV（95%置信水平）。总的来说，研究结果独立证实了宇宙是平坦的，符合广义相对论，并且与ΛCDM模型相当一致，为未来地基CMB调查中的中微子物理铺平了一条充满希望的道路。 <div>
We present cosmological constraints from a gravitational lensing mass map covering 9400 deg2 reconstructed from measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) made by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) from 2017 to 2021. In combination with measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations and big bang nucleosynthesis, we obtain the clustering amplitude σ8 = 0.819 ± 0.015 at 1.8% precision, , and the Hubble constant H0 = (68.3 ± 1.1) km s−1 Mpc−1 at 1.6% precision. A joint constraint with Planck CMB lensing yields σ8 = 0.812 ± 0.013, , and H0 = (68.1 ± 1.0) km s−1 Mpc−1. These measurements agree with ΛCDM extrapolations from the CMB anisotropies measured by Planck. We revisit constraints from the KiDS, DES, and HSC galaxy surveys with a uniform set of assumptions and find that S8 from all three are lower than that from ACT+Planck lensing by levels ranging from 1.7σ to 2.1σ. This motivates further measurements and comparison, not just between the CMB anisotropies and galaxy lensing but also between CMB lensing probing z ∼ 0.5–5 on mostly linear scales and galaxy lensing at z ∼ 0.5 on smaller scales. We combine with CMB anisotropies to constrain extensions of ΛCDM, limiting neutrino masses to ∑mν < 0.13 eV (95% c.l.), for example. We describe the mass map and related data products that will enable a wide array of cross-correlation science. Our results provide independent confirmation that the universe is spatially flat, conforms with general relativity, and is described remarkably well by the ΛCDM model, while paving a promising path for neutrino physics with lensing from upcoming ground-based CMB surveys.

<title>Relativistic Jet Motion in the Radio-quiet LINER Galaxy KISSR 872</title>

We report superluminal jet motion with an apparent speed of βapp = 1.65 ± 0.57 in the radio-quiet (RQ) low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) galaxy KISSR 872. This result comes from two-epoch phase-referenced very long baseline interferometry observations at 5 GHz. The detection of bulk relativistic motion in the jet of this extremely radio-faint active galactic nucleus (AGN), with a total 1.4 GHz flux density of 5 mJy in the 5.″4 resolution Very Large Array FIRST survey image and 1.5 mJy in the ∼5 mas resolution Very Long Baseline Array image, is the first of its kind in an RQ LINER galaxy. The presence of relativistic jets in lower accretion rate objects like KISSR 872, with an Eddington ratio of 0.04, reveals that even RQ AGN can harbor relativistic jets and provides evidence of their universality over a wide range of accretion powers.

<div> Spitzer, Messier 58, H2, AGN, jet<br />
<br />总结:<br />这篇文章讨论了在质量巨大的螺旋星系Messier 58的中心发现了高亮度、温暖的H2盘，并且还有一个具有辐射强活动的活动星系核。研究显示星系内部受到了辐射喷流包覆的冲击，尤其在内部2.6千秒差距的范围内。通过各种成像和光谱显示，大部分分子气体在原地受到了冲击，形成了盘状的灰尘分子气体通道朝向星系核心。碳氧化合物和电离气体的动力学表现十分混乱，速度分散达到300km/s。这种动能和湍流的耗散很可能是由辐射喷流驱动的外流注入星际介质所导致的，并且可能是观测到的分子和电离气体的排放的动力来源。尽管存在辐射喷流活动，内部盘中多环芳烃（PAH）的含量和组成看起来是正常的。PAH的比值表明这些物质是受到了来自星神的间星辐射场的激发，而不是星的形成活动的贡献。喷流冲击的H2现象可能显著减少恒星形成，并帮助调节星系内部盘和超大质量黑洞的质量，在这个通常来说是正常的螺旋星系中发现了类似强烈的H2排放。 <div>
Spitzer spectral maps reveal a disk of highly luminous, warm (>150 K) H2 in the center of the massive spiral galaxy Messier 58, which hosts a radio-loud active galactic nucleus (AGN). The inner 2.6 kpc of the galaxy appears to be overrun by shocks from the radio jet cocoon. Gemini NIRI imaging of the H2 1–0 S(1) emission line, Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array CO 2–1, and Hubble Space Telescope multiband imagery indicate that much of the molecular gas is shocked in situ, corresponding to lanes of dusty molecular gas that spiral toward the galactic nucleus. The CO 2–1 and ionized gas kinematics are highly disturbed, with velocity dispersion up to 300 km s−1. Dissipation of the associated kinetic energy and turbulence, likely injected into the interstellar medium by radio-jet-driven outflows, may power the observed molecular and ionized gas emission from the inner disk. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) fraction and composition in the inner disk appear to be normal, in spite of the jet and AGN activity. The PAH ratios are consistent with excitation by the interstellar radiation field from old stars in the bulge, with no contribution from star formation. The phenomenon of jet-shocked H2 may substantially reduce star formation and help to regulate the stellar mass of the inner disk and supermassive black hole in this otherwise normal spiral galaxy. Similarly strong H2 emission is found at the centers of several nearby spiral and lenticular galaxies with massive bulges and radio-loud AGNs.

通过使用詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜的近红外摄像机宽场无缝光谱仪(NIRCam WFSS)和近红外光谱仪(NIRSpec)，在宇宙演化早期释放调查中测量了155个红移大于2的星系的静止框下光学发射线比。盲目的NIRCam光栅观察包括一组未在NIRSpec掩模上观察到的具有明亮发射线的星系样本。我们通过与较低红移的SDSS、CLEAR和MOSDEF样本进行比较，研究了Hα、[O III]/Hβ和[Ne III]/[O II]发射线随红移的变化。我们发现[O III]/Hβ与红移存在显著(>3σ)的相关性，而[Ne III]/[O II]与红移有边缘(2σ)的相关性。我们将[O III]/Hβ和[Ne III]/[O II]与恒星质量和Hβ SFR进行比较。我们发现这两种发射线比与Hβ SFR呈相关，并与红移0<9的恒星质量呈反相关。与MAPPINGS V模型的比较表明，这些趋势与低金属丰度和高电离在低质量和高SFR的星系一致。我们还与IllustrisTNG预测进行了比较，并发现它们有效地描述了我们样本中观察到的最高[O III]/Hβ比值，而不需要引入具有显著冲击电离组分的MAPPINGS模型。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究利用詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜的不同设备，测量了高红移星系的光学发射线比，并发现这些比值与红移、恒星质量和Hβ SFR有关。与模型的比较表明，这些趋势与低金属丰度和高电离在低质量和高SFR的星系一致，并为我们对星系的演化提供了重要线索。 <div>
We use James Webb Space Telescope Near-Infrared Camera Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (NIRCam WFSS) and the Near-Infrared spectrograph (NIRSpec) in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release survey to measure rest-frame optical emission-line ratios of 155 galaxies at z > 2. The blind NIRCam grism observations include a sample of galaxies with bright emission lines that were not observed on the NIRSpec masks. We study the changes of the Hα, [O III]/Hβ, and [Ne III]/[O II] emission lines in terms of redshift by comparing to lower-redshift SDSS, CLEAR, and MOSDEF samples. We find a significant (>3σ) correlation between [O III]/Hβ with redshift, while [Ne III]/[O II] has a marginal (2σ) correlation with redshift. We compare [O III]/Hβ and [Ne III]/[O II] to stellar mass and Hβ SFR. We find that both emission-line ratios have a correlation with Hβ SFR and an anticorrelation with stellar mass across the redshifts 0 < z < 9. Comparison with MAPPINGS V models indicates that these trends are consistent with lower metallicity and higher ionization in low-mass and high-SFR galaxies. We additionally compare to IllustrisTNG predictions and find that they effectively describe the highest [O III]/Hβ ratios observed in our sample, without the need to invoke MAPPINGS models with significant shock ionization components.

总结:<br />
本研究调查了太阳高次声学模式频率和表面磁活动随着多个太阳周期的时空演变，以改进我们对太阳内部和大气之间联系的理解。研究着重于高次p模式，因其能够表征太阳表面下的剪切层条件，并分析了从全球振荡网络组织获取的22年振荡频率。考虑了10.7厘米射电通量测量、太阳黑子数和局部磁活动指数作为太阳活动的代理，发现模式频率与每个活动指数之间存在强烈的相关性。进一步研究了振荡频率和磁活动代理所关联的南半球和北半球的不对称性，并发现在第23个循环的下降阶段，这两者在南半球占主导地位，而在第24个循环中，这些量在南北半球之间波动。随着太阳循环的推进，分析了不同纬度的频率变化，发现在第24个循环的最大活跃期，中纬度处的变化在南半球占主导地位，但随着循环向最低阶段推进，这些数值开始重合。第25个循环初期的模式频率被发现在南半球占主导地位，遵循磁活动的模式。分析提供了额外证据，表明振荡频率的变化是由强磁场和弱磁场共同导致的。 <div>
We investigate the spatiotemporal evolution of high-degree acoustic-mode frequencies of the Sun and surface magnetic activity over the course of multiple solar cycles, to improve our understanding of the connection between the solar interior and atmosphere. We focus on high-degree p-modes due to their ability to characterize conditions in the shear layer just below the solar surface, and analyze 22 yr of oscillation frequencies obtained from the Global Oscillation Network Group. Considering 10.7 cm radio flux measurements, the sunspot number, and the local magnetic activity index as solar-activity proxies, we find strong correlation between the mode frequencies and each activity index. We further investigate the hemispheric asymmetry associated with oscillation frequencies and magnetic activity proxies, and find that both were dominant in the southern hemisphere during the descending phase of cycle 23, while in cycle 24 these quantities fluctuated between northern and southern hemispheres. Analyzing the frequencies at different latitudes with the progression of solar cycles, we observe that the variations at midlatitudes were dominant in the southern hemisphere during the maximum-activity period of cycle 24, but the values overlap as the cycle advances toward the minimum phase. The mode frequencies at the beginning of cycle 25 are found to be dominant in the southern hemisphere following the pattern of magnetic activity. The analysis provides added evidence that the variability in oscillation frequencies is caused by both strong and weak magnetic fields.

<div> CMEs, angular width, STEREO-A, in situ measurements, magnetic cloud-like signatures
<br /><br />总结:本文利用STEREO-A的观测数据，进行了两部分研究，以限制日冕物质抛射的角宽度。研究表明，在太阳与STEREO-A或地球之间传播的21次CME中，只有4次影响了两艘航天器，且没有一次提供了清晰的磁云状特征。综合两种方法，得出1天文单位处ME的典型角宽度约为20°–30°，比常规假设的2–3倍小，符合椭球形ME的2:1椭圆截面。文章讨论了这一发现对未来多航天器任务设计和CME的连贯性的影响。 <div>
Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large-scale eruptions with a typical radial size at 1 au of 0.21 au but their angular width in interplanetary space is still mostly unknown, especially for the magnetic ejecta (ME) part of the CME. We take advantage of STEREO-A angular separation of 20°–60° from the Sun–Earth line from 2020 October to 2022 August, and perform a two-part study to constrain the angular width of MEs in the ecliptic plane: (a) we study all CMEs that are observed remotely to propagate between the Sun–STEREO-A and the Sun–Earth lines and determine how many impact one or both spacecraft in situ, and (b) we investigate all in situ measurements at STEREO-A or at L1 of CMEs during the same time period to quantify how many are measured by the two spacecraft. A key finding is that out of 21 CMEs propagating within 30° of either spacecraft only four impacted both spacecraft and none provided clean magnetic cloud-like signatures at both spacecraft. Combining the two approaches, we conclude that the typical angular width of an ME at 1 au is ∼20°–30°, or 2–3 times less than often assumed and consistent with a 2:1 elliptical cross section of an ellipsoidal ME. We discuss the consequences of this finding for future multi-spacecraft mission designs and for the coherence of CMEs.

Accurate atomic data and plasma models are essential for interpreting the upcoming high-quality spectra from missions like XRISM and Athena. Estimating physical quantities, like temperature, abundance, turbulence, and the resonance scattering factor, is highly dependent on the underlying atomic data. We use the AtomDB tool variableapec to estimate the impact of atomic data uncertainties in Einstein A coefficients, collisional rate coefficients, and the ionization and recombination rates of H-, He-, and Li-like iron in modeling the spectrum of Perseus observed by Hitomi. The best-fit temperatures, abundances, resonance scattering factors, and turbulence parameters including atomic data uncertainties vary by approximately 17%, 35%, 30%, and 3%, respectively, from the best-fit temperatures, abundances, RS factors, and turbulence parameters estimated without atomic data uncertainties. These indicate that approximately 32%, 35%, and 25% of the best-fit temperatures, abundances, and resonance scattering factors when including uncertainties lie outside the 3σ error regions of their corresponding best-fit values computed with zero atomic data errors. Expanding the energy range to 1.8–20.0 keV shows less variability, with 26% of the abundances and 22% of the resonance scattering factors lying outside the 3σ errors of the best-fit values. We also studied correlations between physical parameters and atomic rate uncertainties to identify key atomic quantities requiring precise lab measurements. We report negative correlations between the best-fit temperatures and the z (1s2s 3S1 → 1s2) collisional rate coefficients, abundances and y (1s2p 3P1 → 1s2) collisional rate coefficients, and abundances and z collisional rate coefficients, and a positive correlation between the resonance scattering factors and the w (1s2p 1P1 → 1s2) collisional rate coefficients.

研究使用NOVA 1D流体动力学计算代码追踪氧-氖白矮星上热核逃逸的演化过程。他们先吸积太阳物质，然后切换到混合组成物。研究结果显示，氧-氖白矮星的经典新星爆发可能对铝26和锂7的产生有重要影响。此外，模拟预测了伽马射线辐射，并讨论了相关的天文现象。在所有模拟中，白矮星喷射的物质少于吸积的物质，因此预测白矮星由于经典新星爆发而增加质量。这表明氧-氖白矮星可能是促发引力坍缩事件的重要通道。<br /><br />总结: <div>
We report on studies of classical nova (CN) explosions where we follow the evolution of thermonuclear runaways (TNRs) on oxygen–neon (ONe) white dwarfs (WDs). Using NOVA, a 1D hydrodynamic computer code, we accrete solar matter until the TNR is ongoing and then switch to a mixed composition. This approach is guided by the results of multidimensional studies of TNRs in WDs, which find that sufficient mixing with WD core material occurs after the TNR is well underway, and levels of enrichment of the CNONeMg elements are reached that agree with observations of CN ejecta abundances. Because the amount of accreted material is inversely proportional to the oxygen abundance, by first accreting solar matter, the amount of accreted material is larger than in those simulations with an initially enriched composition. We vary the mass of the WD (from 0.6 M⊙ to 1.35 M⊙) and the composition of the mixed materials. Our results show large enrichments of 7Be in the ejected gases, implying that ONe CNe and CO CNe may be responsible for a significant fraction (∼100 M⊙) of the Galactic 7Li (∼1000 M⊙). The production of 22Na and 26Al in CN explosions and the γ-ray emission predicted by our simulations are discussed. The WDs in all our simulations eject less material than they accrete and we predict that the WD is growing in mass as a consequence of the CN outburst. ONe CNe, therefore, may be an important channel for accretion-induced collapse events.

总结:
本研究报告了2021年11月3日至5日太阳风暴期间，Solar Orbiter (SolO)和Wind两个太阳探测器对磁云进行了同时的原位观测。研究发现SolO和Wind测得的磁云内磁场和速度存在显著差异，表明即使是2.2°的角度差异也会对观测结果产生影响。另外，利用SolO测得的震波参数进行预测时，出现了2小时30分钟的预测误差。这些结果提示当前的太阳风暴模型分辨率可能存在问题，影响了预测能力。 <div>
Simultaneous in situ measurements of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), including both plasma and magnetic field, by two spacecraft in radial alignment have been extremely rare. Here, we report on one such CME measured by Solar Orbiter (SolO) and Wind on 2021 November 3–5, while the spacecraft were radially separated by a heliocentric distance of 0.13 au and angularly by only 2.2°. We focus on the magnetic cloud (MC) part of the CME. We find notable changes in the R and N magnetic field components and in the speed profiles inside the MC between SolO and Wind. We observe a greater speed at the spacecraft farther away from the Sun without any clear compression signatures. Since the spacecraft are close to each other and computing fast magnetosonic wave speed inside the MC, we rule out temporal evolution as the reason for the observed differences, suggesting that spatial variations over 2.2° of the MC structure are at the heart of the observed discrepancies. Moreover, using shock properties at SolO, we forecast an arrival time 2 hr 30 minutes too late for a shock that is just 5 hr 31 minutes away from Wind. Predicting the north–south component of the magnetic field at Wind from SolO measurements leads to a relative error of 55%. These results show that even angular separations as low as 2.2° (or 0.03 au in arc length) between spacecraft can have a large impact on the observed CME properties, which raises the issue of the resolutions of current CME models, potentially affecting our forecasting capabilities.

<title>Solar Tachocline Confinement by the Nonaxisymmetric Modes of a Dynamo Magnetic Field</title>

<div> 关键词: 3D numerical simulation, tachocline confinement, dynamo-generated magnetic field, solution regimes, solar tachocline confinement<br />
总结: <br />
该研究通过3D数值模拟首次实现了太阳内部的tachocline confinement，并发现了不同磁场强度下的三种解决方案。在弱场阈值中，大尺度磁场大部分是轴对称的，但无法创造一个confined tachocline。在强场阈值中，大尺度磁场大部分是非轴对称的，并创造了一个confined tachocline。在中等场阈值中，大尺度磁场在一定时间内类似于强场阈值，但间歇性地变弱，允许了强的差动旋转。无论在哪种阈值中，RZ中的极化场强度都可以很好地由皮肤深度参数解释。这些模拟结果提出了一个新的太阳tachocline confinement的图像，即通过与RZ旋转的非轴对称、非常长寿命(有效永久)的场结构来起主导作用，而不是与22年周期相关的定期反转的轴对称场。 <div>
We recently presented the first 3D numerical simulation of the solar interior for which tachocline confinement was achieved by a dynamo-generated magnetic field. In this follow-up study, we analyze the degree of confinement as the magnetic field strength changes (controlled by varying the magnetic Prandtl number) in a coupled radiative zone (RZ) and convection zone (CZ) system. We broadly find three solution regimes, corresponding to weak, medium, and strong dynamo magnetic field strengths. In the weak-field regime, the large-scale magnetic field is mostly axisymmetric with regular, periodic polarity reversals (reminiscent of the observed solar cycle) but fails to create a confined tachocline. In the strong-field regime, the large-scale field is mostly nonaxisymmetric with irregular, quasi-periodic polarity reversals and creates a confined tachocline. In the medium-field regime, the large-scale field resembles a strong-field dynamo for extended intervals but intermittently weakens to allow temporary epochs of strong differential rotation. In all regimes, the amplitude of poloidal field strength in the RZ is very well explained by skin-depth arguments, wherein the oscillating field that gives rise to the skin depth (in the medium- and strong-field cases) is a nonaxisymmetric field structure at the base of the CZ that rotates with respect to the RZ. These simulations suggest a new picture of solar tachocline confinement by the dynamo, in which nonaxisymmetric, very long-lived (effectively permanent) field structures rotating with respect to the RZ play the primary role, instead of the regularly reversing axisymmetric field associated with the 22 yr cycle.

<title>Deep Chandra Observation of the Remarkable Ionization Cones of NGC 5252</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Seyfert galaxy NGC 5252 harbors enormously extended ionization cones that have been previously detected in the optical and X-ray band, offering a unique opportunity to investigate the interaction between the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) and the surrounding gas in the AGN host galaxy. We present deep Chandra imaging spectroscopy of NGC 5252 with a total exposure time of 230 ks. The morphology in the soft X-rays shows resolved extended structure from the nucleus to a large radial distance, and for the first time we detect the outermost X-ray arc at ∼20 kpc. The X-ray cone mostly follows the direction of the optical ionization cones in the southeast and northwest directions, about 20° misaligned with the major axis of the galactic disk of NGC 5252. Fitting the spectra extracted from radial sectors with photoionization models supports that extended emission is mainly photoionized by the central AGN. We also examine the variation of the photoionization parameter along the radial extension and infer a decreasing ionizing continuum of the central engine by a factor of ∼50 over the past 64,000 yr. These findings are consistent with previous suggestions that NGC 5252 resembles a quasar relic with an M ∼ 109M⊙ supermassive black hole that went through a minor merger event and switched to a low accretion rate state.

<title>Absorption of Millimeter-band CO and CN in the Early Universe: Molecular Clouds in the Radio Galaxy B2 0902+34 at Redshift 3.4</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad198d</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad198d</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, we have detected absorption lines due to carbon monoxide, CO(J = 0 → 1), and the cyano radical, CN(N = 0 → 1), associated with radio galaxy B2 0902+34 at redshift z = 3.4. The detection of millimeter-band absorption observed 1.5 Gyr after the Big Bang facilitates studying molecular clouds down to gas masses inaccessible to emission-line observations. The CO absorption in B2 0902+34 has a peak optical depth of τ ≥ 8.6% and consists of two components, one of which has the same redshift as previously detected 21 cm absorption of neutral hydrogen (H i) gas. Each CO component traces an integrated H2 column density of ≳ 3 × 1020 cm−2. CN absorption is detected for both CO components, as well as for a blueshifted component not detected in CO, with CO/CN line ratios ranging from ≲0.4 to 2.4. We discuss the scenario that the absorption components originate from collections of small and dense molecular clouds that are embedded in a region with more diffuse gas and high turbulence, possibly within the influence of the central active galactic nucleus or a starburst region. The degree of reddening in B2 0902+34, with rest-frame color B − K ∼ 4.2, is lower than the very red colors (B − K > 6) found among other known redshifted CO absorption systems at z < 1. Nevertheless, when including the many nondetections from the literature, a potential correlation between the absorption-line strength and B − K color is evident, giving weight to the argument that the red colors of CO absorbers are due to a high dust content.

<title>Heliospheric Diffusion of Stochastic Parker Spirals in Radially Evolving Solar Wind Turbulence</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad19dd</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a stochastic field line mapping model where the interplanetary magnetic field lines are described by a density distribution function satisfying a Fokker–Planck equation that is solved numerically. Due to the spiral geometry of the nominal Parker field and to the evolving nature of solar wind turbulence, the heliospheric diffusion of the magnetic field lines is both heterogeneous and anisotropic, including a radial component. The longitudinal distributions of the magnetic field lines are shown to be close to circular Gaussian distributions, although they develop a noticeable skewness. The magnetic field lines emanating from the Sun are found to differ, on average, from the spirals predicted by Parker. Although the spirals remain close to Archimedean, they are here underwound, on average. Our model predicts a spiral angle that is smaller by ∼5° than the Parker spiral angle at Earth’s orbit for the same solar wind speed of Vsw = 400 km s−1. It also predicts an angular position on the solar disk of the best magnetically connected footpoint to an observer at 1 au that is shifted westward by ∼10° with respect to the Parker’s field model. This significantly changes the angle of the most probable magnetic connection between possible sources on the Sun and observers in the inner heliosphere. The results have direct implications for the heliospheric transport of “scatter-free” electrons accelerated in the aftermath of solar eruptions.

<title>Ultra–short-period WD Binaries Are Not Undergoing Strong Tidal Heating</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1dd6</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1dd6</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Double white dwarf (WD) binaries are increasingly being discovered at short orbital periods where strong tidal effects and significant tidal heating signatures may occur. We assume that the tidal potential of the companion excites outgoing gravity waves within the WD primary, the dissipation of which leads to an increase in the WD’s surface temperature. We compute the excitation and dissipation of the waves in cooling WD models in evolving MESA binary simulations. Tidal heating is self-consistently computed and added to the models at every time step. As a binary inspirals to orbital periods less than ∼20 minutes, the WD’s behavior changes from cooling to heating, with temperature enhancements that can exceed 10,000 K compared with nontidally heated models. We compare a grid of tidally heated WD models to observed short-period systems with hot WD primaries. While tidal heating affects their Teff, it is likely not the dominant luminosity. Instead, these WDs are probably intrinsically young and hot, implying that the binaries formed at short orbital periods. The binaries are consistent with undergoing common envelope evolution with a somewhat low efficiency αCE. We delineate the parameter space where the traveling wave assumption is most valid, noting that it breaks down for WDs that cool sufficiently, where standing waves may instead be formed.

<title>The Energy-dependent Gamma-Ray Light Curves and Spectra of the Vela Pulsar in the Dissipative Magnetospheres</title>

We study the pulsar energy-dependent γ-ray light curves and spectra from curvature radiation in the dissipative magnetospheres. The dissipative magnetospheres with the combined force-free (FFE) and Aristotelian are computed by a pseudo-spectral method with a high-resolution simulation in the rotating coordinate system, which produces a near-FFE field structure with the dissipative region only near the equatorial current sheet outside the light cylinder. We use the test-particle trajectory method to compute the energy-dependent γ-ray light curves and phase-average and phase-resolved spectra by including both the accelerating electric field and radiation reaction. The predicted energy-dependent γ-ray light curves and spectra are then compared with those of the Vela pulsar observed by Fermi. Our results can generally reproduce the observed trends of the energy-dependent γ-ray light curves and spectra for the Vela pulsar.

<title>Polarization Leakage and the IXPE Point-spread Function</title>

By measuring photoelectron tracks, the gas pixel detectors of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer satellite provide estimates of the photon detection location and its electric vector position angle (EVPA). However, imperfections in reconstructing event positions blur the image, and EVPA-position correlations result in artificial polarized halos around bright sources. We introduce a new model describing this “polarization leakage” and use it to recover the on-orbit telescope point-spread functions, useful for faint-source detection and image reconstruction. These point-spread functions are more accurate than previous approximations or ground-calibrated products (Δχ2 ≈ 3 × 104 and 4 × 104 respectively for a bright 106-count source). We also define an algorithm for polarization leakage correction substantially more accurate than existing prescriptions (Δχ2 ≈ 1 × 103). These corrections depend on the reconstruction method, and we supply prescriptions for the mission-standard “Moments” methods as well as for “Neural Net” event reconstruction. Finally, we present a method to isolate leakage contributions to polarization observations of extended sources and show that an accurate PSF allows the extraction of sub-PSF-scale polarization patterns.

<title>Simulating Compressive Stream Interaction Regions during Parker Solar Probe’s First Perihelion Using Stream-aligned Magnetohydrodynamics</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We used the stream-aligned magnetohydrodynamics (SA-MHD) model to simulate Carrington rotation 2210, which contains Parker Solar Probe’s (PSP) first perihelion at 36.5 R⊙ on 2018 November 6, to provide context to the in situ PSP observations by FIELDS and SWEAP. The SA-MHD model aligns the magnetic field with the velocity vector at each point, thereby allowing for clear connectivity between the spacecraft and the source regions on the Sun, without unphysical magnetic field structures. During this Carrington rotation, two stream interaction regions (SIRs) form, due to the deep solar minimum. We include the energy partitioning of the parallel and perpendicular ions and the isotropic electrons to investigate the temperature anisotropy through the compression regions to better understand the wave energy amplification and proton thermal energy partitioning in a global context. Overall, we found good agreement in all in situ plasma parameters between the SA-MHD results and the observations at PSP, STEREO-A, and Earth, including at PSP’s perihelion and through the compression region of the SIRs. In the typical solar wind, the parallel proton temperature is preferentially heated, except in the SIR, where there is an enhancement in the perpendicular proton temperature. This is further showcased in the ion cyclotron relaxation time, which shows a distinct decrease through the SIR compression regions. This work demonstrates the success of the Alfvén wave turbulence theory for predicting interplanetary magnetic turbulence levels, while self-consistently reproducing solar wind speeds, densities, and overall temperatures, including at small heliocentric distances and through SIR compression regions.

Numerous structures conducive to magnetic reconnection are frequently observed in the turbulent regions at quasi-parallel shocks. In this work, we use a particle-in-cell simulation to study 3D magnetic reconnection in shock turbulence. We identify and characterize magnetic null points, and focus on reconnection along the separator between them. We identify a reconnection region with strong parallel current, a finite parallel potential, and counterrotating electron flows. Electrons are shown to be accelerated by the parallel electric field before being scattered at the null.

<br /><br />总结:
本文利用JWST/NIRCam数据对红移大于2的星系进行特征提取，样本包括6869个星系，其中255个红移大于5。在消除了星系定向和背景干扰后，利用变分自动编码器构建了一个具有物理意义的特征空间。研究发现红移增加时，球状星系的存在逐渐减少，早期宇宙中盘状星系占据主导地位。传统的目视分类系统在高红移形态分类中不够精确，因此提出了一种基于机器提取特征的更精细分类方案，并展示了这些提取的簇与测定参数的对齐情况，相较于传统方法有着更大的物理相关性。 <div>
Galaxy morphologies provide valuable insights into their formation processes, tracing the spatial distribution of ongoing star formation and encoding signatures of dynamical interactions. While such information has been extensively investigated at low redshift, it is crucial to develop a robust system for characterizing galaxy morphologies at earlier cosmic epochs. Relying solely on nomenclature established for low-redshift galaxies risks introducing biases that hinder our understanding of this new regime. In this paper, we employ variational autoencoders to perform feature extraction on galaxies at z > 2 using JWST/NIRCam data. Our sample comprises 6869 galaxies at z > 2, including 255 galaxies at z > 5, which have been detected in both the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey Hubble Space Telescope fields and the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey done with JWST, ensuring reliable measurements of redshift, mass, and star formation rates. To address potential biases, we eliminate galaxy orientation and background sources prior to encoding the galaxy features, thereby constructing a physically meaningful feature space. We identify 11 distinct morphological classes that exhibit clear separation in various structural parameters, such as the concentration, asymmetry, and smoothness (CAS) metric and M20, Sérsic indices, specific star formation rates, and axis ratios. We observe a decline in the presence of spheroidal-type galaxies with increasing redshift, indicating the dominance of disk-like galaxies in the early Universe. We demonstrate that conventional visual classification systems are inadequate for high-redshift morphology classification and advocate the need for a more detailed and refined classification scheme. Leveraging machine-extracted features, we propose a solution to this challenge and illustrate how our extracted clusters align with measured parameters, offering greater physical relevance compared to traditional methods.

We combine deep imaging data from the CEERS early release JWST survey and Hubble Space Telescope imaging from CANDELS to examine the size–mass relation of star-forming galaxies and the morphology–quenching relation at stellar masses M⋆ ≥ 109.5M⊙ over the redshift range 0.5 < z < 5.5. In this study with a sample of 2450 galaxies, we separate star-forming and quiescent galaxies based on their star formation activity and confirm that star-forming and quiescent galaxies have different morphologies out to z = 5.5, extending the results of earlier studies out to higher redshifts. We find that star-forming and quiescent galaxies have typical Sérsic indices of n ∼ 1.3 and n ∼ 4.3, respectively. Focusing on star-forming galaxies, we find that the slope of the size–mass relation is nearly constant with redshift, as was found previously, but shows a modest increase at z ∼ 4.2. The intercept in the size–mass relation declines out to z = 5.5 at rates that are similar to what earlier studies found. The intrinsic scatter in the size–mass relation is relatively constant out to z = 5.5.

We present six strongly gravitationally lensed Lyα emitters (LAEs) at z ∼ 4–5 with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) narrowband imaging isolating Lyα. Through complex radiative transfer Lyα encodes information about the spatial distribution and kinematics of the neutral hydrogen upon which it scatters. We investigate the galaxy properties and Lyα morphologies of our sample. Many previous studies of high-redshift LAEs have been limited in Lyα spatial resolution. In this work we take advantage of high-resolution Lyα imaging boosted by lensing magnification, allowing us to probe subgalactic scales that are otherwise inaccessible at these redshifts. We use broadband imaging from HST (rest-frame UV) and Spitzer (rest-frame optical) in spectral energy distribution fitting, providing estimates of the stellar masses (∼108–109M⊙), stellar population ages (t50 < 40 Myr), and amounts of dust (AV ∼ 0.1–0.6, statistically consistent with zero). We employ nonparametric star formation histories to probe the young stellar populations which create the Lyα. We also examine the offsets between the Lyα and stellar continuum, finding small upper limits of offsets (<0.″1) consistent with studies of low-redshift LAEs, indicating our galaxies are not interacting or merging. Finally, we find a bimodality in our sample’s Lyα morphologies: clumpy and extended. We find a suggestive trend: our LAEs with clumpy Lyα are generally younger than the LAEs with extended Lyα, suggesting a possible correlation with age.

We present the kinematic analysis of 246 stars within from the center of Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), the closest massive star cluster with active star formation across the full mass range, which provides valuable insights in the formation and evolution of star cluster on an individual-star basis. High-precision radial velocities and surface temperatures are retrieved from spectra acquired by the NIRSPEC instrument used with adaptive optics (NIRSPAO) on the Keck II 10 m telescope. A 3D kinematic map is then constructed by combining with the proper motions previously measured by the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys/WFPC2/WFC3IR and Keck II NIRC2. The measured root-mean-squared velocity dispersion is 2.26 ± 0.08 km s−1, significantly higher than the virial equilibrium’s requirement of 1.73 km s−1, suggesting that the ONC core is supervirial, consistent with previous findings. Energy equipartition is not detected in the cluster. Most notably, the velocity of each star relative to its neighbors is found to be negatively correlated with stellar mass. Low-mass stars moving faster than their surrounding stars in a supervirial cluster suggests that the initial masses of forming stars may be related to their initial kinematic states. Additionally, a clockwise rotation preference is detected. A weak sign of inverse mass segregation is also identified among stars excluding the Trapezium stars, although it could be a sample bias. Finally, this study reports the discovery of four new candidate spectroscopic binary systems.

总结: 
本研究利用中国“天庭计划”的旗舰仪器——道孚太阳射电望远镜阵列的无线频谱观测数据，针对2022年4月17日的一次太阳射电暴进行了研究。通过对频谱漂移速度的分析，确定了相关冲击波的初速度。基于此，考虑到冲击波在活塞驱动阶段的稳定速度，再通过行星间空间传播作为爆轰波的方式来估计了相关冲击波到达STEREO-A观测卫星轨道的传播和到达时间。预测显示，冲击波在2022年4月19日14:31:57 UT到达STEREO-A。而STEREO-A卫星在同一天13:52:12 UT检测到了行星间冲击波。预测和实际到达时间的偏差仅为0.66小时。本研究旨在建立一个通用的预测方法，该方法可以利用地面太阳射电光谱仪或类似DSRT的望远镜观测数据，预测未来更多的事件。<br /><br /> <div>
Since fast head-on coronal mass ejections and their associated shocks represent potential hazards to the space environment of the Earth and even other planets, forecasting the arrival time of the corresponding interplanetary shock is a priority in space weather research and prediction. Based on the radio spectrum observations of the 16-element array of the Daocheng Solar Radio Telescope (DSRT), the flagship instrument of the Meridian Project of China, during its construction, this study determines the initial shock speed of a type II solar radio burst on 2022 April 17 from its drifting speed in the spectrum. Assuming that the shock travels at a steady speed during the piston-driven phase (determined from the X-ray flux of the associated flare) and then propagates through interplanetary space as a blast wave, we estimate the propagation and arrival time of the corresponding shock at the orbit of the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory-A (STEREO-A). The prediction shows that the shock will reach STEREO-A at 14:31:57 UT on 2022 April 19. The STEREO-A satellite detected an interplanetary shock at 13:52:12 UT on the same day. The discrepancy between the predicted and observed arrival time of the shock is only 0.66 hr. The purpose of this paper is to establish a general method for predicting the shock’s propagation and arrival time from this example, which will be utilized to predict more events in the future based on the observations of ground-based solar radio spectrometers or telescopes like DSRT.

总结:
本研究探讨了受霍尔效应影响的尘埃和磁化盘的稳定性以及对行星形成的影响。通过线性分析和非线性模拟，我们发现了一种新的背景漂移霍尔不稳定性（BDHI），它可能有助于在受霍尔效应影响的盘区形成行星。我们还发现在低尘埃气比和弱磁场下，BDHI可能占据主导地位，超过了经典的流动不稳定性（SI）和标准MHD不稳定性。我们还识别了经典SI的磁化版本，但这些通常是次要的。这突显了磁场和尘埃气动力学在原行星盘中的复杂相互作用，强调了在行星形成的更广泛叙事中考虑霍尔效应等非理想MHD的必要性。 <div>
Recent studies have shown that the large-scale gas dynamics of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) are controlled by nonideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), but how this influences dust dynamics is not fully understood. To this end, we investigate the stability of dusty, magnetized disks subject to the Hall effect, which applies to planet-forming regions of PPDs. We find a novel background drift Hall instability (BDHI) that may facilitate planetesimal formation in Hall-effected disk regions. Through a combination of linear analysis and nonlinear simulations, we demonstrate the viability and characteristics of BDHI. We find it can potentially dominate over the classical streaming instability (SI) and standard MHD instabilities at low dust-to-gas ratios and weak magnetic fields. We also identify magnetized versions of the classic SI, but these are usually subdominant. We highlight the complex interplay between magnetic fields and dust-gas dynamics in PPDs, underscoring the need to consider nonideal MHD like the Hall effect in the broader narrative of planet formation.

该文章介绍了层次贝叶斯推断如何同时考虑天文目录中的测量不确定性和选择效应。层次结构编码了关于生成观测数据的物理过程相互依赖的信念。文章指出文献中提出的几种近似方法实际上导致了与任何物理检测过程都不兼容的推断。这通常会导致偏见，并且与这样一个假设相关联：在真实源参数给定的情况下，可检测性与观测数据无关。文章还指出了这种错误如何影响了通过引力波观测到的双星并合事件目录进行的天体物理推断，包括错误估计并合率的红移演化以及错误地推断广义相对论是正确的引力理论。总的来说，不能直接拟合“检测分布”，然后在后处理中“排除”选择效应。同样，当比较理论预测和观测时，最好模拟检测到的数据（包括测量噪声和选择效应），而不是比较事件参数检测分布的估计（只包括选择效应）。尽管由于模型错误假设引起的偏差可能小于中等目录大小（O(100)事件）的统计不确定性，但它们仍将构成精密测量天体群体的重大障碍。<br /><br />总结: 本文讨论了层次贝叶斯推断在考虑天文目录中不确定性和选择效应方面的重要性，并强调了模型错误假设引起的偏差对于天体群体的影响。文章重点指出了在观测数据的理论预测和观测数据比较时应该考虑模拟检测到的数据以及不应该直接拟合“检测分布”来避免偏差的产生。 <div>
Hierarchical Bayesian inference can simultaneously account for both measurement uncertainty and selection effects within astronomical catalogs. In particular, the imposed hierarchy encodes beliefs about the interdependence of the physical processes that generate the observed data. We show that several proposed approximations within the literature actually correspond to inferences that are incompatible with any physical detection process. This generically leads to biases and is associated with the assumption that detectability is independent of the observed data given the true source parameters. We show several examples of how this error can affect astrophysical inferences based on catalogs of coalescing binaries observed through gravitational waves, including misestimating the redshift evolution of the merger rate as well as incorrectly inferring that general relativity is the correct theory of gravity when it is not. In general, one cannot directly fit for the “detected distribution” and “divide out” the selection effects in post-processing. Similarly, when comparing theoretical predictions to observations, it is better to simulate detected data (including both measurement noise and selection effects) rather than comparing estimates of the detected distributions of event parameters (which include only selection effects). While the biases introduced by model misspecification from incorrect assumptions may be smaller than statistical uncertainty for moderate catalog sizes (O(100) events), they will nevertheless pose a significant barrier to precision measurements of astrophysical populations.

<div> 太阳活动、HCME、半球分布、太阳黑子活动、太阳风动压
<br /><br />总结:
本研究通过对SOHO卫星观测得到的HCME目录的分析，发现HCME的来源位置受太阳活动带的限制，并不存在磁活动“冲向极地”的现象。HCME的来源位置呈现一般的半球不对称性，并且与太阳黑子活动的不对称性存在显著差异。第24太阳周期的半球分布与第23太阳周期不同，可能是由于在第23太阳周期极性反转后，太阳风动压显著减小导致的。这些结果有助于更全面地理解高能磁结构的半球不对称性，并为理解HCME的地球效应提供了新的视角。 <div>
The hemispheric asymmetry of solar activity is one of the essential physical consequences of the interior dynamo process. However, the hemispheric distribution of halo coronal mass ejection (HCME) source locations has not been investigated in detail. Based on the HCME catalog identified from the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph Experiment on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, we perform a hemispheric distribution analysis of the HCME source locations from 1996 April to 2022 June. The main results are as follows. (1) The HCME source locations are confined to the active region belt, and there is no “rush to the poles” phenomenon that is unique to large-scale magnetic activity. (2) The HCME source locations exhibit a general hemispheric asymmetry, and autoregressive moving-average model results show that the asymmetry of HCME source locations is significantly different from that of sunspot activity. (3) The hemispheric distribution of cycle 24 is different from that of cycle 23, potentially as a result of the heliospheric dynamic pressure having noticeably decreased after the polarity reversal of cycle 23. Our results contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the hemispheric asymmetry of energetic magnetic structures and give a new perspective on understanding the geoeffectiveness of HCMEs.

总结: 本研究旨在探讨不同磁场外推模型对分析太阳活跃区形态参数在三维空间中的重要性，并提出多种预测参数用于改进太阳爆发的预测。研究发现，使用多种磁场外推模型对太阳活跃区进行建模可以获得相似的形态参数演变趋势，并在预爆发条件方面取得了一定的成效。同时，研究结果表明，在下层太阳大气中应用多种前体参数可以提高对太阳爆发的预测能力，而在3D太阳活跃区的快速可靠洞察方面，PF和LFFF方法是可接受的选择，而NF2方法更为合适。 <div>
The three-dimensional (3D) coronal magnetic field has not yet been directly observed. However, for a better understanding and prediction of magnetically driven solar eruptions, 3D models of solar active regions are required. This work aims to provide insight into the significance of different extrapolation models for analyzing the preeruptive conditions of active regions with morphological parameters in 3D. Here, we employed potential field (PF), linear force-free field (LFFF), and nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) models and a neural network-based method integrating observational data and NLFFF physics (NF2). The 3D coronal magnetic field structure of a “flaring” (AR11166) and “flare-quiet” (AR12645) active region, in terms of their flare productivity, is constructed via the four extrapolation methods. To analyze the evolution of the field, six prediction parameters were employed throughout, from the photosphere up to the base of the lower corona. First, we find that the evolution of the adopted morphological parameters exhibits similarity across the investigated time period when considering the four types of extrapolations. Second, all the parameters exhibited preeruptive conditions not only at the photosphere but also at higher altitudes in the case of active region (AR) 11166, while three out of the six proxies also exhibited preeruptive conditions in the case of AR12645. We conclude that: (i) the combined application of several different precursor parameters is important in the lower solar atmosphere to improve eruption predictions, and (ii) to gain a quick yet reliable insight into the preflare evolution of active regions in 3D, the PF and LFFF are acceptable; however, the NF2 method is likely the more suitable option.

<div> X-ray synchrotron-dominated SNR, spectral analysis, nonthermal origin, shock velocities, pulsar-wind nebula (PWN)
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章报告了对壳状超新星遗迹G32.4+0.1的深入Chandra观测结果。研究发现了部分壳状形态，其轮廓相当圆形，半径约11光年。经过分析，证实了X射线来自非热源，即同步辐射。所需的冲击波速度表明遗迹的年龄大约在5000-9000年之间。此外，未发现X射线与射电脉冲星PSR J1850−0026之间的明显对应关系。然而，其位置与X射线辐射区域相接，可能是脉冲星风星云（PWN）。最后，对于非热辐射的起源仍存在问题，因为脉冲星与壳状超新星遗迹的关联性值得怀疑。 <div>
We present a deep Chandra observation of the shell supernova remnant (SNR) G32.4+0.1, whose featureless X-ray spectrum has led to its classification as an X-ray synchrotron-dominated SNR. We find a partial shell morphology whose outline is quite circular, with a radius of about 11 pc at an assumed distance of 11 kpc. Thermal and power-law spectral models for three relatively bright regions provided equally good fits, but the absence of spectral lines required ionization timescales from thermal fits that are inconsistent with the mean densities derived from emission measures. We thus confirm the nonthermal, i.e., synchrotron, origin of X-rays from G32.4+0.1. Shock velocities needed to accelerate electrons to the required TeV energies are ≳1000 km s−1, giving a remnant age ≲ 5000–9000 yr. There is no obvious X-ray counterpart to the radio pulsar PSR J1850−0026, but its position adjoins a region of X-ray emission whose spectrum is somewhat harder than that of other regions of the shell, and which may be a pulsar-wind nebula (PWN), though its spectrum is steeper than almost all known X-ray PWNe. The distance of the pulsar from the center of symmetry of the shell disfavors a birth in a supernova event at that location only a few thousand years before; either the pulsar (and putative PWN) are not associated with the shell SNR, requiring a coincidence of both position and (roughly) absorbing column density, or the SNR is much older, making the origin of nonthermal emission problematic.

Based on the Heliospheric Imager-1 images of the STEREO twin spacecraft, we established the CORrelation-Aided Reconstruction (CORAR) technique to locate and reconstruct the 3D structures of solar wind transients in interplanetary space. Here, we extend the CORAR method to images of COR2 on board STEREO to study the evolution of small-scale transients in the outer corona from 2010 January to May. We confirm that the transients can be located and reconstructed well by comparing the results with those of a self-similar expanding model. The speed distribution of the reconstructed transients generally shows the typical characteristics of the slow solar wind. We further study the sources of the transients on the Sun, and find that most reconstructed transients are located near the top of streamer belts or the heliospheric current sheet and can be tracked back to the boundaries of the closed-field and open-field regions along the field lines extrapolated by corona models. The formation mechanisms of these transients in the slow solar wind are also discussed.

这项研究报告了在Abell 2744透镜场中通过UNCOVER调查识别的三个遥远T型棕矮星的JWST/NIRSpec光谱。其中一个先前基于NIRCam光度被报告为T矮星候选者，而另外两个最初被确定为候选活动星系核。低分辨率的1-5微米光谱证实了与T矮星大气层一致的分子特征，并与光谱标准进行比较推断它们的分类分别为sdT1、T6和T8-T9。最温暖的源UNCOVER-BD-1显示出次太阳金属丰度的证据，大气模型拟合表明其有效温度为1300K，[M/H]约为-1.0，这使得它成为少数几个光谱确认的T次矮星之一。最寒冷的源UNCOVER-BD-3接近T/Y矮星边界，有效温度为550K，并且我们的分析指出在3-5微米区域存在PH3，相对于CO2更受青睐，这可能是次太阳金属丰度的指示物。我们估计这些棕矮星距离银河中面的距离为0.9-4.5千秒差距，这使它们成为具有光谱确认的最遥远的棕矮星。人口模拟结果表明其中两个棕矮星极有可能属于银河厚盘成员，而UNCOVER-BD-1则有可能属于银河暗盘成员。我们的模拟表明在Abell 2744区域内大约有5个T型矮星和1-2个L型矮星，其亮度下限为F444W = 30 AB mag，其中大约三分之一属于厚盘成员。这些结果突显了JWST/NIRSpec光谱对于识别和表征银河中最古老的金属贫棕矮星的实用性。<br /><br />总结: 本研究通过JWST/NIRSpec光谱确认了Abell 2744中的三个遥远T型棕矮星，其中一个被确认为T次矮星，另外两个被初步确定为候选活动星系核。研究还估计了它们的距离和可能的银河成员身份，这些结果突显了使用JWST/NIRSpec光谱鉴定和表征银河中最古老的金属贫棕矮星的实用性。 <div>
We report JWST/NIRSpec spectra of three distant T-type brown dwarfs identified in the Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) survey of the Abell 2744 lensing field. One source was previously reported as a candidate T dwarf on the basis of NIRCam photometry, while two sources were initially identified as candidate active galactic nuclei. Low-resolution 1–5 μm spectra confirm the presence of molecular features consistent with T dwarf atmospheres, and comparison to spectral standards infers classifications of sdT1, T6, and T8–T9. The warmest source, UNCOVER-BD-1, shows evidence of subsolar metallicity, and atmosphere model fits indicate Teff = 1300 K and [M/H] ∼ −1.0, making this one of the few spectroscopically confirmed T subdwarfs known. The coldest source, UNCOVER-BD-3, is near the T/Y dwarf boundary with Teff = 550 K, and our analysis indicates the presence of PH3 in the 3–5 μm region, favored over CO2 and a possible indicator of subsolar metallicity. We estimate distances of 0.9–4.5 kpc from the Galactic midplane, making these the most distant brown dwarfs with spectroscopic confirmation. Population simulations indicate high probabilities of membership in the Galactic thick disk for two of these brown dwarfs, and potential halo membership for UNCOVER-BD-1. Our simulations indicate that there are approximately 5 T dwarfs and 1–2 L dwarfs in the Abell 2744 field down to F444W = 30 AB mag, roughly one-third of which are thick disk members. These results highlight the utility of deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy for identifying and characterizing the oldest metal-poor brown dwarfs in the Milky Way.

Multiwavelength observations are now the norm for studying blazars’ various states of activity, classifying them, and determining the possible underlying physical processes driving their emission. Broadband emission models became unavoidable tools for testing emission scenarios and setting the values of physical quantities such as the magnetic field strength, Doppler factor, or shape of the particle distribution of the emission zone(s). We announce here the first public release of a new tool, Bjet_MCMC, that can automatically fit the broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of blazars. The complete code is available on GitHub and allows for testing leptonic synchrotron self-Compton models with or without external inverse-Compton processes from the thermal environment of supermassive black holes (accretion disk and broad-line region). The code is designed to be user-friendly and computationally efficient. It contains a core written in C++ and a fully parallelized SED fitting method. The original multi-SSC zone model of Bjet is also available on GitHub but is not included in the Markov Chain Monte Carlo fitting process at the moment. We present the features, performance, and results of Bjet_MCMC, as well as user advice.

We investigate the merger between a 16M⊙ star, on its way to becoming a red supergiant (RSG), and a 4M⊙ main-sequence companion. Our study employs three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations using the state-of-the-art adaptive mesh refinement code Octo-Tiger. The initially corotating binary undergoes interaction and mass transfer, resulting in the accumulation of mass around the companion and its subsequent loss through the second Lagrangian point (L2). The companion eventually plunges into the envelope of the primary, leading to its spin-up and subsequent merger with the helium core. We examine the internal structural properties of the post-merger star, as well as the merger environment and the outflow driven by the merger. Our findings reveal the ejection of approximately ∼0.6 M⊙ of material in an asymmetric and somewhat bipolar outflow. We import the post-merger stellar structure into the MESA stellar evolution code to model its long-term nuclear evolution. In certain cases, the post-merger star exhibits persistent rapid equatorial surface rotation as it evolves in the H–R diagram toward the observed location of Betelgeuse. These cases demonstrate surface rotation velocities of a similar magnitude to those observed in Betelgeuse, along with a chemical composition resembling that of Betelgeuse. In other cases, efficient rotationally induced mixing leads to slower surface rotation. This pioneering study aims to model stellar mergers across critical timescales, encompassing dynamical, thermal, and nuclear evolutionary stages.

Green Bank North Celestial Cap survey是最大、最敏感的脉冲星和瞬变射电天体的调查之一，已完成观测，重点转向对其发现进行长期监测。研究团队开发了一个处理大型归档观测数据集的管道，并将其与近期使用Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment望远镜进行的高频率观测相连接。他们处理了128颗脉冲星的数据，并测量了自旋、位置和轨道参数，连接了长达2000天的观测间隔。此外，他们还测量了五颗脉冲星的时间残差中的瞬变以及19颗源的proper motion。他们还更新了19颗脉冲星的轨道参数，包括九颗以前未发表的二元系统。对于其中两个二元系统，他们提供了更精确的后开普勒参数测量，从而更准确地估计了两个系统的总质量。对于PSR J0509+3801，他们大大改善了爱因斯坦延迟的测量结果，得到了脉冲星和伴星的质量分别为1.399(6) M⊙和1.412(6) M⊙的更精确测量。对于这个系统，他们还获得了由于引力波辐射而导致的轨道衰减的测量结果，与这些质量的广义相对论预测的速率一致。 <br /><br />总结: 这项研究使用大数据处理技术处理了脉冲星的观测数据，更新了它们的参数并发现了新的二元系统。对于PSR J0509+3801这个系统，获得了更准确的质量测量和引力波辐射速率的测量结果。 <div>
The Green Bank North Celestial Cap survey is one of the largest and most sensitive searches for pulsars and transient radio objects. Observations for the survey have finished; priorities have shifted toward long-term monitoring of its discoveries. In this study, we have developed a pipeline to handle large data sets of archival observations and connect them to recent, high-cadence observations taken using the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment telescope. This pipeline handles data for 128 pulsars and has produced measurements of spin, positional, and orbital parameters that connect data over observation gaps as large as 2000 days. We have also measured glitches in the timing residuals for five of the pulsars included and proper motion for 19 sources (13 new). We include updates to orbital parameters for 19 pulsars, including nine previously unpublished binaries. For two of these binaries, we provide updated measurements of post-Keplerian binary parameters, which result in much more precise estimates of the total masses of both systems. For PSR J0509+3801, the much improved measurement of the Einstein delay yields much improved mass measurements for the pulsar and its companion, 1.399(6) M⊙ and 1.412(6) M⊙, respectively. For this system, we have also obtained a measurement of the orbital decay due to the emission of gravitational waves, , which is in agreement with the rate predicted by general relativity for these masses.

总结: 
研究团队利用iSHELL在NASA红外望远镜设施上观测了HD 32297恒星周围的M波段光谱，并利用Gemini Planet Imager拍摄了HD 131488的H波段偏振图像。他们在HD 32297的光谱中搜索基本的CO吸收线，但没有检测到。他们估计了CO的列密度上限，并结合ALMA测得的CO质量和盘的几何特性，估计了CO的尺度高度。研究还对其他三个富含CO的边缘盘进行了类似的估算，并发现在假设处于静力平衡的情况下，CO和毫米尘埃的尺度高度可能存在潜在的相关性。可能的解释是这四个系统中气体和尘埃可能具有相似的次级起源。<br /><br />总结: 研究团队利用高光谱分辨率设备和成像设备对恒星周围的碎片盘进行了观测，估计了CO的尺度高度，并发现了潜在的气体和尘埃尺度高度的相关性，提出了气体和尘埃可能具有相似的次级起源的可能解释。 <div>
We present high-spectral-resolution M-band spectra from iSHELL on NASA’s Infrared Telescope Facility along the line of sight to the debris disk host star HD 32297. We also present a Gemini Planet Imager H-band polarimetric image of the HD 131488 debris disk. We search for fundamental CO absorption lines in the iSHELL spectra of HD 32297, but do not detect any. We place an upper limit on the CO column density of ∼6 × 1015 cm−2. By combining the column density upper limit, the CO mass measured with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and the geometrical properties of the disk, we estimate the scale height of the CO to be ≲2 au across the radial extent of the disk (∼80–120 au). We use the same method to estimate the CO scale height of three other edge-on, CO-rich debris disks that all have CO observed in absorption with the Hubble Space Telescope as well as in emission with ALMA: β Pictoris, HD 110058, and HD 131488. We compare our estimated CO scale heights of these four systems to the millimeter dust scale heights and find that, under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, there is a potential correlation between the CO and millimeter dust scale heights. There are multiple factors that affect the gas vertical structure such as turbulence, photodissociation with weak vertical mixing, as well as where the gas originates. One possible explanation for the potential correlation could be that the gas and dust are of a similar secondary origin in these four systems.

总结：

Under the assumption of a simple and time-invariant gravitational potential, many Galactic dynamics techniques infer the milky Way’s mass and dark matter distributions from stellar kinematic observations. These methods typically rely on parameterized potential models of the Galaxy and must take into account nontrivial survey selection effects, because they make use of the density of stars in phase space. Large-scale spectroscopic surveys now supply information beyond kinematics in the form of precise stellar label measurements (especially element abundances). These element abundances are known to correlate with orbital actions or other dynamical invariants. Here, we use the Orbital Torus Imaging framework that uses abundance gradients in phase space to map orbits. In many cases these gradients can be measured without detailed knowledge of the selection function. We use stellar surface abundances from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment survey combined with kinematic data from the Gaia mission. Our method reveals the vertical (z-direction) orbital structure in the Galaxy and enables empirical measurements of the vertical acceleration field and orbital frequencies in the disk. From these measurements, we infer the total surface mass density, Σ, and midplane volume density, ρ0, as a function of Galactocentric radius and height. Around the Sun, we find and using the most constraining abundance ratio, [Mg/Fe]. This corresponds to a dark matter contribution in surface density of Σ⊙,DM(z = 1.1 kpc) = 24 ± 4 M⊙ pc−2, and in total volume mass density of ρ⊙,DM(z = 0) = 0.011 ± 0.002 M⊙ pc−3. Moreover, using these mass density values we estimate the scale length of the low-α disk to be hR = 2.24 ± 0.06 kpc.

总结: 
Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)的观测结果使我们能够精确研究超大质量黑洞的吸积过程。文章利用基于动力学物理学的简单模型研究了螺旋度屏障对EHT可见的电磁观测量的影响。研究发现，螺旋度屏障在磁场更加有序的区域以及在MAD流域中可能会对辐射形态和电子温度产生显著影响。此外，忽略螺旋度屏障可能导致低估吸积率和射流功率。研究结果强调了螺旋度屏障在塑造黑洞可观测量和推断吸积系统参数方面的重要性。 <div>
Horizon-scale observations from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) have enabled precision study of supermassive black hole accretion. Contemporary accretion modeling often treats the inflowing plasma as a single, thermal fluid, but microphysical kinetic effects can lead to significant deviations from this idealized picture. We investigate how the helicity barrier influences EHT-accessible electromagnetic observables by employing a simple model for electron heating based on kinetic physics and the cascade of energy and helicity in unbalanced turbulence. Although the helicity barrier plays only a minor role in regions with high plasma β, like in standard and normal evolution (SANE) disks, it may substantially impact regions with more ordered magnetic fields, such as the jet and its surrounding wind in SANE flows as well as throughout the entire domain in magnetically arrested disk (MAD) flows. In SANE flows, emission shifts from the funnel wall toward the lower-magnetization disk region; in MAD flows the emission morphology remains largely unchanged. Including the helicity barrier leads to characteristically lower electron temperatures, and neglecting it can lead to underestimated accretion rates and inferred jet powers. The corresponding higher plasma densities result in increased depolarization and Faraday depths thereby decreasing the amplitude of the β2 coefficient while leaving its angle unchanged. Both the increased jet power and lower may help alleviate outstanding tensions between modeling and EHT observations. We also find that the estimated ring diameter may be underestimated when the helicity barrier is neglected. Our results underscore the significance of the helicity barrier in shaping black hole observables and inferred accretion system parameters.

<div> 低质量星系、低质量天体对、Illustris TNG100模拟、宇宙时期、合并率<br />
总结:<br />这篇文章介绍了对低质量星系对进行研究，并指出了在不同时期低质量星系对的变化趋势与高质量星系对不同，通过利用Illustris TNG100模拟创建了一组物理相关的低质量和高质量星系对的样本，并表明了在恢复低质量和高质量星系对之间的差异时，随着系统质量和红移的变化而变化的分离限制是至关重要的，最后还在宇宙背景下放置了类似于当地星系群中的孤立质量对。 <div>
Low-mass galaxy pair fractions are understudied, and it is unclear whether low-mass pair fractions evolve in the same way as more massive systems over cosmic time. In the era of JWST, Roman, and Rubin, selecting galaxy pairs in a self-consistent way will be critical to connect observed pair fractions to cosmological merger rates across all mass scales and redshifts. Utilizing the Illustris TNG100 simulation, we create a sample of physically associated low-mass (108 < M* < 5 × 109M⊙) and high-mass (5 × 109 < M* < 1011M⊙) pairs between z = 0 and 4.2. The low-mass pair fraction increases from z = 0 to 2.5, while the high-mass pair fraction peaks at z = 0 and is constant or slightly decreasing at z > 1. At z = 0 the low-mass major (1:4 mass ratio) pair fraction is 4× lower than high-mass pairs, consistent with findings for cosmological merger rates. We show that separation limits that vary with the mass and redshift of the system, such as scaling by the virial radius of the host halo (rsep < 1Rvir), are critical for recovering pair fraction differences between low-mass and high-mass systems. Alternatively, static physical separation limits applied equivalently to all galaxy pairs do not recover the differences between low- and high-mass pair fractions, even up to separations of 300 kpc. Finally, we place isolated mass analogs of Local Group galaxy pairs, i.e., Milky Way (MW)–M31, MW–LMC, LMC–SMC, in a cosmological context, showing that isolated analogs of LMC–SMC-mass pairs and low-separation (<50 kpc) MW–LMC-mass pairs are 2–3× more common at z ≳ 2–3.

这篇文章报告了对阿贝尔1240的深度查德拉观测，该天体是一个红移为0.195的二元并合星系团，其中包括两个最亮的星系团星系，它们可能在0.3亿年前相互经过。研究集中在星团核心的西北和东南方向两个明显的广大射电残留物。研究利用了高分辨率的查德拉成像技术，确定了在星团中心西北1兆帕斯卡和东南1.2兆帕斯卡的两个明显的面亮度边缘，与两者的外缘完全一致。我们的温度测量表明这些边缘是冲击波边缘。从气体密度跳跃中求得的马赫数为SE冲击波为3.5，NW冲击波为3.8。我们估计的马赫数与从射电观测中获得的显著小，这突显了重新加速场景占主导地位，而不是直接加速来自热池的电子。此外，我们比较了两种模型对两个冲击波内外的观测温度剖面。两个冲击波都支持库仑碰撞模型，但由于预冲击温度不确定性，我们无法排除纯碰撞模型。 <br /><br />总结: 这篇文章描述了对星团Abell 1240的深度查德拉观测，发现了两个广大射电残留物，并确定了两个冲击波边缘。通过温度测量和马赫数计算，研究结果表明重新加速场景占据主导地位。此外，通过比较两种模型对观测温度剖面的预测，发现射电观测所得的马赫数明显高于碰撞模型预测的值。 <div>
We present a 368 ks deep Chandra observation of Abell 1240, a binary merging galaxy cluster at a redshift of 0.195 with two brightest cluster galaxies that may have passed each other 0.3 Gyr ago. Building upon previous investigations involving Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, Very Large Array, and LOFAR data, our study focuses on two prominent extended radio relics at the northwest (NW) and southeast (SE) of the cluster core. By leveraging the high-resolution Chandra imaging, we have identified two distinct surface-brightness edges at ∼1 Mpc and 1.2 Mpc NW and SE of the cluster center, respectively, coinciding with the outer edges of both relics. Our temperature measurements suggest the edges to be shock front edges. The Mach numbers, derived from the gas density jumps, yield = for the SE shock and = for the NW shock. Our estimated Mach numbers are remarkably smaller compared to those derived from radio observations ( = 2.3 and = 2.4), highlighting the prevalence of a reacceleration scenario over direct acceleration of electrons from the thermal pool. Furthermore, we compare the observed temperature profiles across both shocks with those of predictions from collisional versus collisionless models. Both shocks favor the Coulomb collisional model, but we could not rule out a purely collisionless model due to pre-shock temperature uncertainties.

太阳探测器Parker Solar Probe在接近太阳的轨道上观测到了与CIR相关的高能质子增强现象。研究发现，这些高能质子在距离太阳46倍半径的地方向太阳辐射，CIR持续时间至少为一个太阳自转周期，并且在1天文单位附近的其他探测器上也观测到了相应的高能质子增强。另外，观测还表明，质子的能谱在太阳附近比较陡峭，在接近1天文单位时变得更硬。这些结果表明，在1天文单位以内，CIR结构可以加速粒子，并且这些粒子可以深入内太阳系。<br /><br /> <div>
The radial evolution of particles accelerated at corotating interaction regions (CIRs) is not fully understood, particularly the distance range over which this particle acceleration occurs and how the energy spectra are modulated by transport through the inner heliosphere. Here, we present observations of energetic proton enhancements associated with a CIR observed by Parker Solar Probe on 2021 April 25 during the inbound leg of its orbit near ∼46 Rs (∼0.21 au). The CIR is identified at additional spacecraft (Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, STEREO-A; Solar Orbiter, SolO; and Advanced Composition Explorer, ACE) using a corotation time delay estimation, and energetic proton spectra from each spacecraft are compared. We find that (1) energetic protons are observed near 46 Rs streaming sunward ahead of the CIR; (2) the CIR persists for at least one solar rotation and the corresponding energetic proton enhancements are observed at STEREO-A, SolO, and ACE; and (3) the proton energy spectrum is steeper near the Sun and hardens near 1 au. This observation presents the closest in situ energetic particle observation of a CIR to the Sun ever recorded. Results presented here suggest that particles can be accelerated by CIR structures within 1 au and these particles can penetrate very deep into the inner heliosphere.

While various methods have been proposed to disentangle the progenitor system for Type Ia supernovae, their origin is still unclear. A circumstellar environment is key to distinguishing between the double-degenerate and single-degenerate (SD) scenarios since a dense wind cavity is expected only in the case of the SD system. We perform spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy of Tycho’s supernova remnant (SNR) with XMM-Newton and reveal the three-dimensional velocity structure of the expanding shock-heated ejecta measured from Doppler-broadened lines of intermediate-mass elements. Obtained velocity profiles are fairly consistent with those expected from a uniformly expanding ejecta model near the center, whereas we discover a rapid deceleration (∼4000 to ∼1000 km s−1) near the edge of the remnant in almost every direction. The result strongly supports the presence of a dense wall entirely surrounding the remnant, which is confirmed also by our hydrodynamical simulation. We thus conclude that Tycho’s SNR is likely of SD origin. Our new method will be useful for understanding progenitor systems of Type Ia SNRs in the era of high-angular/energy-resolution X-ray astronomy with microcalorimeters.

Recent numerical studies suggest that magnetic fields play an important role in primordial star formation in the early Universe. However, the detailed evolution of the magnetic field in the collapse phase still has uncertainties because of the complicated physics associated with turbulence in a collapsing magnetized system. Here, we perform a suite of numerical MHD simulations that follow the collapse of magnetized, turbulent primordial gas clouds to investigate the evolution of the magnetic field associated with the turbulence, assuming a polytropic equation of state with exponent γeff and with various numerical resolutions. In addition, we generalize the analytic theory of magnetic field growth/saturation so that it can deal with various exponents γeff and turbulence energy spectra. We find that the numerical results are well reproduced by the theory for various γeff through the collapse phase during the formation of the first stars. The magnetic field is eventually amplified by a factor of 1012–1015 due to kinematic and nonlinear turbulent dynamo effects and reaches 3%–100% of the equipartition level, depending on γeff. We also find that the transition between the kinematic and nonlinear stages can be analytically estimated. These results indicate that the strong magnetic field accompanied by supersonic turbulence is a general property and suggest that it can play a crucial role in the formation of the first stars.

Exoplanets with short orbit periods reside very close to their host stars. They transition very rapidly between different sectors of the circumstellar space environment along their orbit, leading to large variations of the magnetic field in the vicinity of the planet on short timescales. This rapid change of the magnetic flux through the conducting and resistive layer of the planetary upper atmosphere may drive currents that dissipate in the form of Joule heating (JH). Here, we estimate the amount of JH dissipation in the upper atmosphere of Trappist-1e, and two hypothetical planets orbiting the Sun in close-in orbits. We find that the rapid orbital motion could drive a significant amount of atmospheric heating and could significantly affect the planetary atmosphere escape rate. Thus, the process should be accounted for when studying the long-term evolution of exoplanetary atmospheres.

A fundamental question in galaxy and black hole evolution remains how galaxies and their supermassive black holes have evolved together over cosmic time. Specifically, it is still unclear how the position of X-ray active galactic nucleus (AGN) host galaxies with respect to the star-forming main sequence (MS) may change with the X-ray luminosity (LX) of the AGN or the stellar mass (M⋆) of the host galaxy. We use data from the XMM-Spitzer Extragalactic Representative Volume Survey (XMM-SERVS) to probe this issue. XMM-SERVS is covered by the largest medium-depth X-ray survey (with superb supporting multiwavelength data) and thus contains the largest sample to date for study. To ensure consistency, we locally derive the MS from a large reference galaxy sample. In our analysis, we demonstrate that the turnover of the galaxy MS does not allow reliable conclusions to be drawn for high-mass AGNs, and we establish a robust safe regime where the results do not depend upon the choice of MS definition. Under this framework, our results indicate that less massive AGN host galaxies ( ) generally possess enhanced star formation rates compared to their normal-galaxy counterparts while the more massive AGN host galaxies ( ) lie on or below the star-forming MS. Further, we propose an empirical model for how the placement of an AGN with respect to the MS (SFRnorm) evolves as a function of both M⋆ and LX.

Stellar streams form through the tidal disruption of satellite galaxies or globular clusters orbiting a host galaxy. Globular cluster streams are exciting since they are thin (dynamically cold) and therefore sensitive to perturbations from low-mass subhalos. Since the subhalo mass function differs depending on the dark matter composition, these gaps can provide unique constraints on dark matter models. However, current samples are limited to the Milky Way. With its large field of view, deep imaging sensitivity, and high angular resolution, the upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) presents a unique opportunity to increase the number of observed streams and gaps significantly. This paper presents a first exploration of the prospects for detecting gaps in streams in M31 and other nearby galaxies with resolved stars. We simulate the formation of gaps in a Palomar 5–like stream and generate mock observations of these gaps with background stars in M31 and foreground Milky Way stellar fields. We assess Roman's ability to detect gaps out to 10 Mpc through visual inspection and with the gap-finding tool FindTheGap. We conclude that gaps of ≈1.5 kpc in streams that are created from subhalos of masses ≥5 × 106M⊙ are detectable within a 2–3 Mpc volume in exposure times of 1000 s to 1 hr. This volume contains ≈150 galaxies, including ≈eight galaxies with luminosities >109L⊙. Large samples of stream gaps in external galaxies will open up a new era of statistical analyses of gap characteristics in stellar streams and help constrain dark matter models.

<div> 黑洞、星团、质量分离、模拟、星体破坏
总结：<br /><br />这项研究关注了质量分离对星团内恶性破坏事件的影响。根据蒙特卡洛模拟，发现质量分离会导致重物质体聚集在中心黑洞附近，而轻物质体则过度集中在外围区域。研究还考虑了在黑洞附近星团内被破坏并注入的恒星对该过程的影响。模拟结果表明，这种质量分离对星体的破坏速率产生了自洽的影响，对于星团整体的演化具有重要意义。 <div>
The centers of galaxies host a supermassive black hole (SMBH) surrounded by a dense stellar cluster. The cluster is expected to develop mass segregation, in which gravitational scatterings among the stars cause heavier objects to sink closer to the central black hole, while lighter objects will tend to be overconcentrated in the outer regions. This work focuses on the implications of mass segregation on the different channels for violent destruction of stars in the cluster: tidal disruptions, gravitational-wave-driven inspirals and high-velocity destructive collisions between stars. All such events occur close to the central black hole, where the heavier objects congregate. The analysis is based on a simplified Monte Carlo simulation, which evolves a two-mass population in a cluster surrounding a Milky Way–like SMBH. The simulation is based on the single-mass scheme used by Sari & Fragione and Balberg & Yassur, which has been extended to allow for the dynamical friction effects typical of unequal-mass populations. The effects of mass segregation on the rates of the different destruction channels are analyzed self-consistently in the overall evolution of the cluster. Also considered are stars which are injected into the cluster after being disrupted from a binary system by the SMBH. Such stars are captured in the inner regions of the cluster, and so their orbital evolution, as well as their destruction rate, are therefore influenced by heavy objects that might be abundant in the vicinity of the SMBH.

总结:<br />
这篇文章讨论了如何将系统发育方法应用于模拟的盘状星系，以研究其演化历史。研究发现，至少需要100颗恒星颗粒才能可靠地描绘所选恒星族群的演化历史，并且化学丰度的典型不确定性小于0.08 dex时，整体演化历史能够可靠地保留。研究结果显示，系统树的形状受到年龄-金属丰度关系以及星系恒星形成历史的影响。低星形成率的区域产生的树比高星形成率的区域短。我们的分析表明，系统发育方法可以揭示星系演化的过程。 <div>
Phylogenetic methods have long been used in biology and more recently have been extended to other fields—for example, linguistics and technology—to study evolutionary histories. Galaxies also have an evolutionary history and fall within this broad phylogenetic framework. Under the hypothesis that chemical abundances can be used as a proxy for the interstellar medium’s DNA, phylogenetic methods allow us to reconstruct hierarchical similarities and differences among stars—essentially, a tree of evolutionary relationships and thus history. In this work, we apply phylogenetic methods to a simulated disk galaxy obtained with a chemodynamical code to test the approach. We found that at least 100 stellar particles are required to reliably portray the evolutionary history of a selected stellar population in this simulation, and that the overall evolutionary history is reliably preserved when the typical uncertainties in the chemical abundances are smaller than 0.08 dex. The results show that the shapes of the trees are strongly affected by the age–metallicity relation, as well as the star formation history of the galaxy. We found that regions with low star formation rates produce shorter trees than regions with high star formation rates. Our analysis demonstrates that phylogenetic methods can shed light on the process of galaxy evolution.

<title>Soft X-Ray Energy Spectra in the Wide-field Galactic Disk Area Revealed with HaloSat</title>

<br /><br />总结:
本研究分析了HaloSat对银河盘中五个地方的观测数据，这些地方距离银心较远（135° < l < 254°），旨在理解银河盘中软X射线能量辐射的性质。通过这些观测，发现了可能存在未解的高温等离子体（UHTPGD），其温度在0.8-1.0 keV，发射度为(8-11) × 10−4 cm−6 pc。我们还观测到在没有明亮源的区域中存在UHTPGD辐射。通过堆积光谱的研究，发现星等点源可能是UHTPGD的组成部分。这项研究表明，UHTPGD可能在整个银河盘中都存在，并且可能部分起源于星等点源。 <div>
We analyzed data from HaloSat observations for five fields in the Galactic disk located far away from the Galactic center (135° < l < 254°) to understand the nature of soft X-ray energy emission in the Galactic disk. The fields have 14° diameter and were selected to contain no significant high-flux X-ray sources. All five HaloSat soft X-ray energy spectra (0.4–7 keV with energy resolution of < 100 eV below 1 keV) show a possibility of the presence of unresolved high-temperature plasma in the Galactic disk (UHTPGD) with a temperature of 0.8–1.0 keV and an emission measure of (8–11) × 10−4 cm−6 pc in addition to the soft X-ray diffuse background components mainly studied at higher Galactic latitudes (solar wind charge exchange emission, Local Hot Bubble, Milky Way halo emission, and the cosmic X-ray background). This suggests that the UHTPGD is present across the whole Galactic disk. We also observed UHTPGD emission in a region with no bright sources in an XMM-Newton field contained within one of the HaloSat fields. The temperature and emission measure are consistent with those measured with HaloSat. Moreover, the stacked spectra of the X-ray pointlike sources and near-infrared-identified point sources such as stars in the XMM-Newton field also show a spectral feature similar to the UHTPGD emission. This suggests that the UHTPGD may partly originate from pointlike sources such as stars.

<div> quasars, black hole mass function, Eddington-ratio distribution function, z = 4, broad-line AGNs
<br />
这篇文章研究了在 z=4 时红移的宽线活动星系核（AGNs）的黑洞质量函数（BHMF）和Eddington比分布函数（ERDF），并基于来自Subaru超级望远镜战略计划S16A-Wide2数据集的52个i < 23.2的类星体和来自Sloan数字Sky Survey数据第7版类星体目录中相同红移范围内的1462个i < 20.2类星体进行了研究。利用CIV 1549 Å线的宽度和1350 Å处的连续光度估算了类星体的维里黑洞（BH）质量。通过对低质量或低Eddington比范围中由流量限制选择引起的不完整性进行校正，得到了真实的宽线AGN BHMF和ERDF。与文献中 z∼2时的宽线AGN BHMF相比，我们发现大质量SMBH的数量密度在较高的红移处达到峰值，这与逐渐演化的情况一致。此外，得到的ERDF显示出负相关性，表明更大质量的SMBH倾向于以较低的Eddington比率吸积在z=4时。通过得出的真实的宽线AGN BHMF，我们还评估了 z=4 时在整个SMBH群体中宽线AGN的活动比例。得出的活跃比例可能表明与BH质量的正相关性。最后，我们通过解决连续方程来考察了 z=4 到 6 之间的宽线AGN BHMF的时间演化。结果表明 z=4–6 时的宽线AGN BHMF仅在归一化方面发生演化，但其形状没有显著变化。<br /><br />总结: 本文研究了 z=4 时的宽线活动星系核（AGNs）的黑洞质量函数（BHMF）和Eddington比分布函数（ERDF）。作者通过样本研究发现大质量SMBH的数量密度在较高的红移处达到峰值，且得到的ERDF显示出负相关性。此外，作者还评估了 z=4 时在整个SMBH群体中宽线AGN的活动比例，并考察了 z=4 到 6 之间的宽线AGN BHMF的时间演化，发现了一些有趣的结果。 <div>
We investigate the black hole mass function (BHMF) and Eddington-ratio distribution function (ERDF) of broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at z = 4, based on a sample of 52 quasars with i < 23.2 at 3.50 ≤ z ≤ 4.25 from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program S16A-Wide2 data set, and 1462 quasars with i < 20.2 in the same redshift range from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 7 quasar catalog. Virial black hole (BH) masses of quasars are estimated using the width of the CIV 1549 Å line and the continuum luminosity at 1350 Å. To obtain the intrinsic broad-line AGN BHMF and ERDF, we correct for the incompleteness in the low-mass and/or low-Eddington-ratio ranges caused by the flux-limited selection. The resulting BHMF is constrained down to . In comparison with broad-line AGN BHMFs at z ∼ 2 in the literature, we find that the number density of massive SMBHs peaks at higher redshifts, consistent with the downsizing evolutionary scenario. Additionally, the resulting ERDF shows a negative dependence on BH mass, suggesting more massive SMBHs tend to accrete at lower-Eddington ratios at z = 4. With the derived intrinsic broad-line AGN BHMF, we also evaluate the active fraction of broad-line AGNs among the entire SMBH population at z = 4. The resulting active fraction may suggest a positive dependence on BH mass. Finally, we examine the time evolution of broad-line AGN BHMF between z = 4 and 6 through solving the continuity equation. The results suggest that the broad-line AGN BHMFs at z = 4–6 only show evolution in their normalization, but with no significant changes in their shape.

Observations have shown a clear association of filament/prominence eruptions with the emergence of magnetic flux in or near filament channels. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations have been employed to systematically study the conditions under which such eruptions occur. These simulations to date have modeled filament channels as 2D flux ropes or 3D uniformly sheared arcades. Here we present MHD simulations of flux emergence into a more realistic configuration consisting of a bipolar active region containing a line-tied 3D flux rope. We use the coronal flux-rope model of Titov et al. as the initial condition and drive our simulations by imposing boundary conditions extracted from a flux emergence simulation by Leake et al. We identify three mechanisms that determine the evolution of the system: (i) reconnection displacing footpoints of field lines overlying the coronal flux rope, (ii) changes of the ambient field due to the intrusion of new flux at the boundary, and (iii) interaction of the (axial) electric currents in the preexisting and newly emerging flux systems. The relative contributions and effects of these mechanisms depend on the properties of the preexisting and emerging flux systems. Here we focus on the location and orientation of the emerging flux relative to the coronal flux rope. Varying these parameters, we investigate under which conditions an eruption of the latter is triggered.

<div> Aluminum nitrides, nucleating agent, coupled cluster theory, Murchison meteorite, rovibrational spectroscopic analysis
<br />
本文通过理论研究发现了一种新的铝氮化物形成途径，并计算了相关的振动光谱常数。该发现有潜力辅助天体物理学家在星际介质中检测到新的无机物种，这可能标志着更大的尘埃颗粒的成核过程。通过对AlH3和氨转化为Al2N2H4的反应途径和振动光谱分析，为可能在实验室或观测中的研究提供了参考。AlNH6的ν8弯曲频率为755.7 cm−1（13.23 μm），具有515 km mol−1的振动跃迁强度，比二氧化碳的对称C−O伸展更强，并且具有5.40 D的偶极矩，大约是水的3倍。 <div>
A dust nucleating agent may be present in interstellar or circumstellar media that has gone seemingly undetected and unstudied for decades. Some analyses of the Murchison CM2 meteorite suggest that at least some of the aluminum present within condensed as aluminum nitrides instead of the long-studied, but heretofore undetected suite of aluminum oxides. The present theoretical study utilizes explicitly correlated coupled cluster theory and density functional theory to provide a formation pathway from alane (AlH3) and ammonia to the cyclic structure Al2N2H4, which has the proper Al/N ratio expected of bulk aluminum nitrides. Novel rovibrational spectroscopic constants are computed for alane and the first two formed structures, AlNH6 and AlNH4, along the reaction pathway for use as reference in possible laboratory or observational studies. The ν8 bending frequency for AlNH6 at 755.7 cm−1 (13.23 μm) presents a vibrational transition intensity of 515 km mol−1, more intense than the antisymmetric C−O stretch of carbon dioxide, and contains a dipole moment of 5.40 D, which is ∼3× larger than that of water. Thus, the present reaction pathway and rovibrational spectroscopic analysis may potentially assist in the astrophysical detection of novel, inorganic species which may be indicative of larger dust grain nucleation.

总结: 
Parker Solar Probe（PSP）和Solar Orbiter（SolO）任务打开了一个新的观测窗口，对内部太阳圈层进行直接测量。研究表明，行星际震荡的局部特征以及它们的环境在它们穿越太阳圈层时可能非常不同。PSP观察表明，磁场交替将在通过震荡时被压缩，而离子回旋波的特征在震荡下游消失。相比之下，SolO的观察揭示了一个非常结构化的震荡过渡，随着太阳风结构穿越震荡，出现了高达约2MeV的震荡加速质子的特征。此外，SolO还报告了由于上游震荡导致的能量较低（约100 eV）的电子散射。 <div>
The Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO) missions opened a new observational window in the inner heliosphere, which is finally accessible to direct measurements. On 2022 September 5, a coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven interplanetary (IP) shock was observed as close as 0.07 au by PSP. The CME then reached SolO, which was radially well-aligned at 0.7 au, thus providing us with the opportunity to study the shock properties at different heliocentric distances. We characterize the shock, investigate its typical parameters, and compare its small-scale features at both locations. Using the PSP observations, we investigate how magnetic switchbacks and ion cyclotron waves are processed upon shock crossing. We find that switchbacks preserve their V–B correlation while compressed upon the shock passage, and that the signature of ion cyclotron waves disappears downstream of the shock. By contrast, the SolO observations reveal a very structured shock transition, with a population of shock-accelerated protons of up to about 2 MeV, showing irregularities in the shock downstream, which we correlate with solar wind structures propagating across the shock. At SolO, we also report the presence of low-energy (∼100 eV) electrons scattering due to upstream shocklets. This study elucidates how the local features of IP shocks and their environments can be very different as they propagate through the heliosphere.

Active galactic nucleus (AGN) driven outflows can have a significant impact on the evolution of the host galaxy. In this work, we compare the properties of galaxies that host AGNs with and without outflows. Our sample consists of 103 AGNs identified by mid-IR color–color selection and confirmed with optical spectroscopy at a redshift range of 0.3 ≲ z ≲ 0.9. We fit the [O iii] λ5007 line using spectra from the zCOSMOS survey to identify and study the occurrence of outflows. We find that ionized outflows are present in ∼25% of our sample, with the largest incidence at the highest [O iii] and X-ray luminosity bins. The fastest outflows are found in the more extended and massive galaxies. We do not observe a difference in the star formation rate of AGNs with outflows compared to AGNs without outflows. From visual inspection and nonparametric morphological studies, we obtain that outflows are preferentially observed in galaxies with disk-type and elliptical morphologies.

We present JWST MIRI 5.6, 10, and 21 μm observations of the candidate failed supernova N6946-BH1 along with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFPC/IR 1.1 and 1.6 μm data and ongoing optical monitoring data with the Large Binocular Telescope. There is a very red, dusty source at the location of the candidate, which has only ∼10%–15% of the luminosity of the progenitor star. The source is very faint in the HST near-IR observations (∼103L⊙) and is not optically variable to a limit of ∼103L⊙ at the R band. The dust is likely silicate and probably has to be dominated by very large grains, as predicted for dust formed in a failed supernova. The required visual optical depths are modest, so it should begin to significantly brighten in the near-IR over the next few years.

The corona is a structure possessed by stars, including the Sun. The abnormal heating of the solar corona and chromosphere is one of the greatest mysteries in modern astronomy. While state-of-the-art observations have identified some candidates of magnetic activity events that could be responsible for this abnormal heating, and theoretical studies have proposed various heating modes, a complete physical picture of how they are heated as a whole remains elusive. In this study, the characteristics of the heated corona and chromosphere are investigated, and for the first time, the question of how they are abnormally heated is explicitly answered by analyzing the long-term observations of the global chromosphere in the Ca ii K line and the global corona in the coronal green line. The findings reveal that both the quiet chromosphere and corona are in antiphase with the solar cycle, whereas the active chromosphere and corona are in phase with it. Different parts of the solar corona and chromosphere exhibit significantly different variation characteristics and are found to be heated by different magnetic categories and probably in different modes. This study posits that unraveling the heating mystery is best approached through the lens of magnetic categories, rather than magnetic activity events.

Stellar-mass black holes (sBHs) embedded in gaseous disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be important sources of detectable gravitational radiation for LIGO/Virgo when they form binaries and coalesce due to orbital decay. In this paper, we study the effect of dynamical friction (DF) on the formation of BH binaries in AGN disks using N-body simulations. We employ two simplified models of DF, with the force on the BH depending on Δv, the velocity of the sBH relative to the background Keplerian gas. We integrate the motion of two sBHs initially on circular orbits around the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) and evaluate the probability of binary formation under various conditions. We find that both models of DF (with different dependence of the frictional coefficient on ∣Δv∣) can foster the formation of binaries when the effective friction timescale τ satisfies ΩKτ ≲ 20–30 (where ΩK is the Keplerian frequency around the SMBH): prograde binaries are formed when the DF is stronger (smaller τ), while retrograde binaries dominate when the DF is weaker (larger τ). We determine the distribution of both prograde and retrograde binaries as a function of initial orbital separation and the DF strength. Using our models of DF, we show that for a given sBH number density in the AGN disk, the formation rate of sBH binaries increases with decreasing τ and can reach a moderate value with a sufficiently strong DF.

The blazar TXS 0506+056 has been proposed as a high-energy neutrino emitter. However, it has been shown that the standard one-zone model cannot produce sufficiently high neutrino flux due to constraints from the X-ray data, implying more complex properties of the radiation zones in the blazar than that described by the standard one-zone model. In this work, we investigate multiepoch high-energy muon-neutrino events associated with the blazar TXS 0506+056 that occurred in 2014–2015, 2017–2018, 2021–2022, and 2022–2023, respectively. We applied the so-called “stochastic dissipation model” to account for the neutrino-blazar associations detected in the four epochs simultaneously. This model describes a scenario in which the emission of the blazar arises from the superimposition of two components: a persistent component related to the quasi-stable state of the blazar and a transient component responsible for the sudden enhancement of the blazar’s flux, either in electromagnetic radiation or in neutrino emission. The latter component could form at a random distance along the jet by a strong energy dissipation event. Under such an assumption, the multiepoch broadband spectral energy distribution can be well explained, and the expected number of high-energy neutrino events is statistically realistic. The expected number of neutrino events in half year is around 8.2, 0.07, 0.73, and 0.41, corresponding to the epoch in 2014–2015, 2017–2018, 2021–2022, and 2022–2023, respectively. Hence, our model self-consistently explains the episodic neutrino emission from TXS 0506+056.

<title>First High-resolution Spectroscopy of X-Ray Absorption Lines in the Obscured State of NGC 5548</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Multiwavelength spectroscopy of NGC 5548 revealed remarkable changes due to the presence of an obscuring wind from the accretion disk. This broadened our understanding of obscuration and outflows in active galactic nuclei. Swift monitoring of NGC 5548 shows that over the last 10 yr, the obscuration has gradually declined. This provides a valuable opportunity for analyses that have not been feasible before because of too much obscuration. The lowered obscuration, together with the high-energy spectral coverage of Chandra HETG, facilitates the first study of X-ray absorption lines in the obscured state. The comparison of the lines (Mg xi, Mg xii, Si xiii, and Si xiv) between the new and historical spectra reveals interesting changes, most notably the He-like absorption being significantly diminished in 2022. Our study finds that the changes are caused by an increase in both the ionization parameter and the column density of the warm-absorber outflow in the obscured state. This is contrary to the shielding scenario that is evident in the appearance of the UV lines, where the inner obscuring wind shields outflows that are farther out, thus lowering their ionization. The X-ray absorption lines in the HETG spectra appear to be unaffected by the obscuration. The results suggest that the shielding is complex because various components of the ionized outflow are affected differently. We explore various possibilities for the variability behavior of the X-ray absorption lines and find that the orbital motion of a clumpy ionized outflow traversing our line of sight is the most likely explanation.

<title>Constraining Annihilating Dark Matter Using the Multifrequency Radio Flux Profiles of the M33 Galaxy</title>

Radio data can give stringent constraints for annihilating dark matter. In general, radio observations can detect very accurate radio flux density with high resolution and different frequencies for nearby galaxies. We are able to obtain the radio flux density as a function of distance from the galactic center and frequencies S(r, ν). In this article, we demonstrate a comprehensive radio analysis of the M33 galaxy, combining the radio flux density profile S(r) and the frequency spectrum S(ν) to get the constraints of dark matter annihilation parameters. By analyzing the archival radio data obtained from the Effelsberg telescope, we show that the dark matter annihilation contributing to the radio flux density might be insignificant in the disk region of the M33 galaxy. Moreover, by including the baryonic radio contribution, we constrain the 2σ conservative upper limits of the annihilation cross section, which can be complementary to the existing constraints based on neutrino, cosmic-ray, and gamma-ray observations. Our results indicate that analyzing the galactic multifrequency radio flux profiles can give useful and authentic constraints on dark matter for the leptophilic annihilation channels.

Poisson-FOCuS算法可以在计算成本的限制下优化地检测伽马射线暴，适用于即将推出的HERMES-Pathfinder卫星。该算法能够在实时并以较低的计算成本检测计数时间序列中的所有时间间隔，所有时间尺度和偏移，通过对历史数据进行验证，证明了该实施方案在自动背景评估方面具有更高的检测能力。其分析速度比历史Fermi-GBM的benchmark模拟器快两倍，实现了更高性能。总结:<br /><br />作者使用Poisson-FOCuS算法在小型卫星上实时检测伽马射线暴。他们通过验证和模拟数据表明，该算法在计算成本和检测能力方面都具有优势。 <div>
We describe how a novel online change-point detection algorithm, called Poisson-FOCuS, can be used to optimally detect gamma-ray bursts within the computational constraints imposed by miniaturized satellites such as the upcoming HERMES-Pathfinder constellation. Poisson-FOCuS enables testing for gamma-ray burst onset at all intervals in a count time series, across all timescales and offsets, in real time and at a fraction of the computational cost of conventional strategies. We validate an implementation with automatic background assessment through exponential smoothing, using archival data from Fermi-GBM. Through simulations of lightcurves modeled after real short and long gamma-ray bursts, we demonstrate that the same implementation has higher detection power than algorithms designed to emulate the logic of Fermi-GBM and Compton-BATSE, reaching the performance of a brute-force benchmark with oracle information on the true background rate, when not hindered by automatic background assessment. Finally, using simulated data with different lengths and means, we show that Poisson-FOCuS can analyze data twice as fast as a similarly implemented benchmark emulator for the historic Fermi-GBM on-board trigger algorithms.

总结:
频域分析可以帮助解决活动星系核的中心引擎尺寸问题。NGC 5548的时间延迟与经典的Shakura-Sunyaev盘模型的X射线再处理不一致，但CHAR模型能够很好地解释NGC 5548的时间延迟。此外，我们对Mrk 817进行了CHAR模型预测，并得到了有效于不同黑洞质量和Eddington比率范围内的时间延迟。我们还证明了CHAR模型的滞后 - 亮度关系与观测一致。未来的观测将有助于验证我们的结果，并为解决活动星系核的中心引擎提供新的见解。 <div>
Continuum reverberation mapping with high-cadence, long-term UV/optical monitoring of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) enables us to resolve the AGN central engine sizes on different timescales. The frequency-resolved time lags of NGC 5548 (the target for the AGN STORM I campaign) are inconsistent with the X-ray reprocessing of the classical Shakura–Sunyaev disk model. Here we show that the frequency-resolved time lags in NGC 5548 can be well produced by the Corona-Heated Accretion-disk Reprocessing (CHAR) model. Moreover, we make CHAR model predictions of the frequency-resolved time lags for Mrk 817, the source of the AGN STORM II campaign. We also obtain frequency-resolved time lags as a function of the BH mass and Eddington ratio, which is valid for BH masses from 106.5 to 109M⊙ and Eddington ratios from 0.01 to 1. Moreover, we demonstrate that with the time spans of current continuum reverberation-mapping campaigns, the lag–luminosity relation of the CHAR model can be , which is consistent with observations. Future observations can test our results and shed new light on resolving the AGN central engine.

总结:
脉冲星发出的宽带射电波在穿过星际介质时会受到扭曲和延迟。研究者使用CLEAN去卷积技术来恢复脉冲展宽的时间尺度，从而揭示脉冲的真实形状。通过模拟数据进行参数化，开发了一套测试来确定散射时间尺度及其不确定性。该算法在高度散射的毫秒脉冲星J1903+0327上进行了测试，显示散射时间尺度随时间变化，与脉冲星的折射时间尺度估计一致。这项研究还将改进的算法与循环光谱法进行了比较，验证了其有效性。 <div>
Broadband radio waves emitted from pulsars are distorted and delayed as they propagate toward the Earth due to interactions with the free electrons that compose the interstellar medium (ISM), with lower radio frequencies being more impacted than higher frequencies. Multipath propagation in the ISM results in both later times of arrival for the lower frequencies and causes the observed pulse to arrive with a broadened tail described via the pulse broadening function. We employ the CLEAN deconvolution technique to recover the pulse broadening timescale and by proxy the intrinsic pulse shape. This work expands upon previous descriptions of CLEAN deconvolution used in pulse broadening analyses by parameterizing the efficacy on simulated data and developing a suite of tests to establish which of a set of figures of merit leads to an automatic and consistent determination of the scattering timescale and its uncertainty. We compare our algorithm to the cyclic spectroscopy method of estimating the scattering timescale, specifically to the simulations performed in Dolch et al. (2021). We test our improved algorithm on the highly scattered millisecond pulsar J1903+0327, showing the scattering timescale to change over years, consistent with estimates of the refractive timescale of the pulsar.

本文详细分析了JWST NIRCam在八个滤波器下的点扩散函数（PSF），发现PSF的空间变化随波长增加而减少。且研究比较了构建模型PSF的三种常用方法，并得出PSFEx表现最佳的结论。通过模拟宽线活动星系核（AGN）的图像，评估了PSF不匹配对宿主星系属性恢复的影响。结果发现，使用不匹配的PSF模型通常会高估宿主星系的通量，同时影响宿主测量的系统误差通常大于形式拟合误差。此外，图像分解也可能导致AGN和宿主星系之间的人工偏移，这种现象在高表面亮度的宿主星系中更为常见。文章最后通过一个在CEERS领域的z = 1.646的宽线类星体示例展示了他们的PSF构建和图像分解方法。 <br /><br />总结: 本文研究了JWST NIRCam的PSF特性，评估了PSF不匹配对宿主星系属性恢复的影响，并提出了PSF构建和图像分解的方法。 <div>
We present a detailed analysis of the point-spread function (PSF) of JWST NIRCam imaging in eight filters: F070W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F444W, and F480M, using publicly available data. Spatial variations in the PSF FWHM generally decrease with wavelength: the maximum and rms fractional variations are ∼20% and 5% in F070W, reduced to ∼3% and 0.6% in F444W. We compare three commonly used methods (SWarp, photutils, and PSFEx) to construct model PSFs and conclude that PSFEx delivers the best performance. Using simulated images of broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we evaluate the impact of PSF mismatches on the recoverability of host galaxy properties. Host fluxes are generally overestimated when adopting mismatched PSF models, with larger overestimation for more AGN-dominated systems. Broader PSFs tend to produce less concentrated hosts, while narrower PSFs tend to produce more concentrated and compact hosts. Systematic uncertainties in host measurements from PSF and model mismatches are generally larger than the formal fitting uncertainties for high signal-to-noise ratio data. Image decomposition can also lead to an artificial offset between the AGN and host centroids, which is common (e.g., >1σ [3σ] detection in ∼80% [∼20%–30%] of systems), and scales with the mean host surface brightness (SB). Near the SB limit, this artificial offset can reach as large as ∼80%, 26%, and 7% of Re in systems with Re = 0.″12, 0.″48, and 1.″92, respectively. We demonstrate our PSF construction and image decomposition methods with an example broad-line quasar at z = 1.646 in the CEERS field.

总结:
这篇文章讨论了恒星自转周期、年龄的精确测量，以及磁制动的强度和与标准自转减速的偏离程度。通过利用恒星振动学，可以测量出比太阳更老的恒星的自转周期，从而可以对更大范围的老场星进行模型测试。研究发现，通过神经网络和层次化模型拟合方法的结合，可以限制磁制动减弱的开始时间。研究还表明，磁制动减弱在恒星演化到太阳阶段之前就开始了，对于类太阳恒星的主序阶段约有一半的寿命存在挑战。此外，还发现了临界罗斯比数的阈值为Rocrit/Ro⊙ = 0.91 ± 0.03。不同物理假设下的模型网格对于推断制动定律的属性有影响。这些发现对于恒星年龄的测定和自转周期的推断具有重要意义。<br /><br /> <div>
Despite a growing sample of precisely measured stellar rotation periods and ages, the strength of magnetic braking and the degree of departure from standard (Skumanich-like) spin-down have remained persistent questions, particularly for stars more evolved than the Sun. Rotation periods can be measured for stars older than the Sun by leveraging asteroseismology, enabling models to be tested against a larger sample of old field stars. Because asteroseismic measurements of rotation do not depend on starspot modulation, they avoid potential biases introduced by the need for a stellar dynamo to drive starspot production. Using a neural network trained on a grid of stellar evolution models and a hierarchical model-fitting approach, we constrain the onset of weakened magnetic braking (WMB). We find that a sample of stars with asteroseismically measured rotation periods and ages is consistent with models that depart from standard spin-down prior to reaching the evolutionary stage of the Sun. We test our approach using neural networks trained on model grids produced by separate stellar evolution codes with differing physical assumptions and find that the choices of grid physics can influence the inferred properties of the braking law. We identify the normalized critical Rossby number Rocrit/Ro⊙ = 0.91 ± 0.03 as the threshold for the departure from standard rotational evolution. This suggests that WMB poses challenges to gyrochronology for roughly half of the main-sequence lifetime of Sun-like stars.

总结: 本研究针对NGC 2264的星形成区进行了850μm的连续波偏振观测，并发现了非均匀结构的磁场。NGC 2264C地区受到重力的全局支配，而在2264D地区，磁、引力和动能之间的平衡。根据本地解析的磁场结构、重力矢量场和提取的纤维网络，推断出纤维网络主要由两组近似垂直的纤维组成。此外，重力显示出一个主导的汇聚方向，大致垂直于一个纤维方向，暗示着沿着这个方向的物质吸积。我们鉴别出两种类型的纤维，即I型纤维垂直于磁场，而II型纤维平行于磁场。我们解释这两种纤维的产生是由于受到纤维自身引力驱动的径向坍缩和受到区域全局引力驱动的纵向坍缩之间的竞争。 <div>
We report 850 μm continuum polarization observations toward the filamentary high-mass star-forming region NGC 2264, taken as part of the B-fields In STar forming Regions Observations large program on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. These data reveal a well-structured nonuniform magnetic field in the NGC 2264C and 2264D regions with a prevailing orientation around 30° from north to east. Field strength estimates and a virial analysis of the major clumps indicate that NGC 2264C is globally dominated by gravity, while in 2264D, magnetic, gravitational, and kinetic energies are roughly balanced. We present an analysis scheme that utilizes the locally resolved magnetic field structures, together with the locally measured gravitational vector field and the extracted filamentary network. From this, we infer statistical trends showing that this network consists of two main groups of filaments oriented approximately perpendicular to one another. Additionally, gravity shows one dominating converging direction that is roughly perpendicular to one of the filament orientations, which is suggestive of mass accretion along this direction. Beyond these statistical trends, we identify two types of filaments. The type I filament is perpendicular to the magnetic field with local gravity transitioning from parallel to perpendicular to the magnetic field from the outside to the filament ridge. The type II filament is parallel to the magnetic field and local gravity. We interpret these two types of filaments as originating from the competition between radial collapsing, driven by filament self-gravity, and longitudinal collapsing, driven by the region's global gravity.

在最近的研究中，发现磁性阻滞盘（MAD）能够产生强大的喷流，在许多吸积系统中都有观察到。本研究使用cuHARM对14个广义相对论磁流体模拟了黑洞自旋下的MAD状态的吸积支配吸积流。主要发现如下：（i）喷流以Maxwell应力的形式将大量角动量输运至无穷远。对于正值高自旋情况下，角动量输运率比负自旋情况下高出约五倍，而对于非旋转黑洞来说，这一贡献几乎可以忽略不计。（ii）质量吸积率和在视界处计算的MAD参数之间没有相关性，但是它们的时间导数对于每个自旋都是负相关的。（iii）对于零自旋，磁场的径向分量对磁压的贡献可以忽略不计，而对于高自旋的黑洞来说，与径向磁场分量的贡献相当。对于高正自旋情况下，甚至磁场的垂直分量占主导地位。（iv）对于负的自旋，喷流比正自旋情况下更窄，而且波动更强烈。非旋转黑洞的弱喷流是最宽的，波动最弱。我们的研究突显了MAD状态下黑洞自旋与盘和喷流特性之间的复杂非线性关系。

<br /><br />总结:研究表明，MAD状态下黑洞自旋与盘和喷流特性之间存在复杂而非线性的关系，具体表现为喷流通过Maxwell应力以及质量吸积率和MAD参数的时间导数呈负相关。此外，不同自旋情况下磁场构成的不同，对于负自旋喷流更窄波动更强，而非旋转黑洞的喷流最宽波动最弱。 <div>
The study of magnetically arrested disks (MAD) has attracted strong interest in recent years because these disk configurations were found to generate strong jets, as observed in many accreting systems. Here, we present the results of 14 general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of advection-dominated accretion flow in the MAD state across black hole (BH) spins, carried out with cuHARM. Our main findings are as follows. (i) The jets transport a significant amount of angular momentum to infinity in the form of Maxwell stresses. For positive, high spin, the rate of angular momentum transport is about five times higher than for negative spin. This contribution is nearly absent for a nonrotating BH. (ii) The mass accretion rate and the MAD parameter, both calculated at the horizon, are not correlated. However, their time derivatives are anticorrelated for every spin. (iii) For zero spin, the contribution of the toroidal component of the magnetic field to the magnetic pressure is negligible, while for a fast-spinning BH, it is on the same order as the contribution of the radial magnetic component. For high positive spin, the toroidal component even dominates. (iv) For negative spins, the jets are narrower than their positive-spin counterparts, while their fluctuations are stronger. The weak jet from the nonrotating BH is the widest with the weakest fluctuations. Our results highlight the complex nonlinear connection between the black hole spin and the resulting disk and jet properties in the MAD regime.

总结:
利用Very Large Array进行了针对IRAS 19035+0641 A的1.3 cm连续波和22.2 GHz H2O激射观测。发现了一个在尺度≲500 au的延长的双极性1.3 cm连续波结构，与上升的带内谱指数一起，强烈暗示指向IRAS 19035+0641 A的射流是电离的。此外，还确定了8个水激射点，它们与射流轴线很好地对齐。最亮的H2O激射线Stokes V谱显示可能的泽曼分裂，并且可以用拟合到Stokes I谱形的两个高斯成分的导数很好地表示。测得的Blos分别为123 (±27)和156 (±8) mG，相应的预激震磁场约为7 mG。后续的观测证实了泽曼分裂，并且发现了所有水激射点的强烈变化，其中最亮的激射完全消失。在1年的时间尺度内观察到的变化可能是一个吸积事件的结果。这些发现加强了对IRAS 19035+0641 A作为处于早期吸积/流出演化阶段的高质量原恒星的解释。 <div>
We present Very Large Array 1.3 cm continuum and 22.2 GHz H2O maser observations of the high-mass protostellar object IRAS 19035+0641 A. Our observations unveil an elongated bipolar 1.3 cm continuum structure at scales ≲500 au, which, together with a rising in-band spectral index, strongly suggests that the radio emission toward IRAS 19035+0641 A arises from an ionized jet. In addition, eight individual water maser spots well aligned with the jet axis were identified. The Stokes V spectrum of the brightest H2O maser line (∼100 Jy) shows a possible Zeeman splitting and is well represented by the derivatives of two Gaussian components fitted to the Stokes I profile. The measured Blos are 123 (±27) and 156 (±8) mG, translating to a preshock magnetic field of ≈7 mG. Subsequent observations to confirm the Zeeman splitting showed intense variability in all the water maser spots, with the brightest maser completely disappearing. The observed variability in a 1 yr timescale could be the result of an accretion event. These findings strengthen our interpretation of IRAS 19035+0641 A as a high-mass protostar in an early accretion/outflow evolutionary phase.

Photodissociated gas bears the signature of the dynamical evolution of the ambient interstellar medium impacted by the mechanical and radiative feedback from an expanding H ii region. Here we present an analysis of the kinematics of the young Trifid Nebula, based on velocity-resolved observations of the far-infrared fine structure lines of [C ii] at 158 μm and [O i] at 63 μm. The distribution of the photodissociated regions (PDRs) surrounding the nebula is consistent with a shell-like structure created by the H ii region expanding at a velocity of 5 km s−1. Comparison of ratios of [C ii] and [O i]63 μm intensities for identical velocity components with PDR models indicate a density of 104 cm−3. The redshifted and blueshifted PDR shells with a combined mass of 516 M⊙ have a kinetic energy of ∼1047 erg. This is consistent with the thermal energy of the H ii region as well as with the energy deposited by the stellar wind luminosity from HD 169442A, an O7 V star, over the 0.5 Myr lifetime of the star. The observed momentum of the PDR shell is lower than what theoretical calculations predict for the radial momentum due to the shell being swept up by an expanding H ii region, which suggests that significant mass loss has occurred in M20 due to the dispersal of the surrounding gas by the advancing ionization front.

本研究对N v X射线发射线进行了实验测量，发现其强度约为共振线的五分之一。此外，还提供了融合线的波长数据，并进行了原子结构计算的测试，结果与理论计算方法的计算结果相吻合。这些实验和理论数据为精确的静止波长提供了基准，可帮助确定活跃星系核和其他天体物质吸收特征的速度。 <div>
We present laboratory measurements of n = 3 → n = 1 N v X-ray emission lines situated near 26 Å. The lines are excited by electron-impact collisions and are shown to reach a combined intensity of about a fifth of the combined strong N v 1s2s2p2P1/2,3/2 → 1s22s2S1/2 resonance lines, commonly labeled q and r, at 29.4 Å. In addition, we present new experimental data for the wavelength of the blended q and r lines at 29.4 Å, as well as for that of the blended inner-shell-excited N v lines u and v at 30.0 Å. All of these collisional N v lines need to be included in astrophysical emission models in order to properly account for flux from N v in the soft X-ray region. The measured wavelengths provide benchmarks for testing atomic structure calculations and excellent agreement is found with our calculations using the many-body perturbation theory method. We provide a complete listing of the N v energy levels with valence electrons in the n = 2, 3, and 4 shells calculated with this approach. The experimental and theoretical data, thus, provide accurate rest-frame wavelengths needed for velocity determinations based on high-resolution absorption features in spectra of warm absorbers in active galactic nuclei and other astrophysical objects.

<div> 关键词: dark galaxies, IllustrisTNG, 暗物质晕, 星等

总结: 本研究利用IllustrisTNG宇宙水动力学模拟研究了暗物质星系的形成和演化。首先识别了具有恒星质量-总质量比M*/Mtot小于10−4的暗物质星系，与具有M*/Mtot ≥ 10−4的发光星系不同。然后选择了具有大约10^9h-1M⊙暗物质暗物质晕质量的星系，比较它们的物理特性与发光星系。发现，在当今宇宙（z = 0）中，暗物质星系主要位于无星形气体的空洞区域。此外，暗物质星系倾向于具有比较大的尺寸和更高的自旋参数。在早期宇宙中，暗物质星系和发光星系在自旋和局部环境估计的分布上存在较小差异，随着演化，这两个样本之间的差异变得更加显著。研究结果表明，与发光星系不同，暗物质星系倾向于最初形成在密度较小的区域，并且由于宇宙复电离的加热以及与其他含有恒星的系统的相互作用和并合较少而无法形成恒星。这项基于数值模拟的研究能够为验证观测中的暗物质星系候选者和约束星系形成模型提供重要线索。 <div>
We study the formation and evolution of dark galaxies using the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. We first identify dark galaxies with stellar-to-total mass ratios, M*/Mtot, smaller than 10−4, which differ from luminous galaxies with M*/Mtot ≥ 10−4. We then select the galaxies with a dark matter halo mass of ∼109h−1M⊙ for mass completeness and compare their physical properties with those of luminous galaxies. We find that, at the present epoch (z = 0), dark galaxies are predominantly located in void regions without star-forming gas. We also find that dark galaxies tend to have larger sizes and higher spin parameters than luminous galaxies. In the early universe, dark and luminous galaxies show small differences in the distributions of spin and local environment estimates, and the difference between the two samples becomes more significant as they evolve. Our results suggest that, unlike luminous galaxies, dark galaxies tend to be initially formed in less dense regions and could not form stars because of heating from cosmic reionization and few interactions and mergers with other systems containing stars. This study based on numerical simulations can provide important hints for validating dark galaxy candidates in observations and for constraining galaxy formation models.

总结:<br /><br />研究比较了在A2744星系团中使用ALMA 1.2毫米数据和SCUBA-2 450和850 μm成像的效果。结果显示，将SCUBA-2数据与JWST红外观测相结合可以更有效地发现微弱尘埃星系的存在。通过比对观测结果，研究确认约95%的微弱尘埃星系，并且借助红外先验条件还可以进一步深入ALMA图像观测。同时，发现46/69的ALMA源在850 μm波段有信号，24/69在450 μm波段也有信号，总检测率接近75%。另外，发现SCUBA-2检测到的比例在z=3后略有下降，推测这可能与ALMA选择以及波段之间的信号比有关。这项研究强调了结合SCUBA-2数据和JWST颜色观测可以更好地绘制微弱尘埃星系的能力。 <div>
We make a comparison of deep SCUBA-2 450 and 850 μm imaging on the massive lensing cluster field A2744 with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.2 mm data. Our primary goal is to assess how effective the wider-field SCUBA-2 sample, in combination with red JWST priors, is for finding faint dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) compared to the much more expensive mosaicked ALMA observations. We cross-match our previously reported direct (>5σ) SCUBA-2 sample and red JWST NIRCam prior-selected (>3σ) SCUBA-2 sample to direct ALMA sources from the DUALZ survey. We find that roughly 95% are confirmed by ALMA. The red priors also allow us to probe deeper in the ALMA image. Next, by measuring the 450 and 850 μm properties of the full ALMA sample, we show that 46/69 of the ALMA sources are detected at 850 μm and 24/69 are detected at 450 μm in the SCUBA-2 images, with a total detection fraction of nearly 75%. All of the robust (>5σ) ALMA sources that are not detected in at least one SCUBA-2 band lie at 1.2 mm fluxes ≲0.6 mJy and are undetected primarily due to the higher SCUBA-2 flux limits. We also find that the SCUBA-2 detection fraction drops slightly beyond z = 3, which we attribute to the increasing 1.2 mm to 850 μm and 1.2 mm to 450 μm flux ratios combined with the ALMA selection. The results emphasize the power of combining SCUBA-2 data with JWST colors to map the faint DSFG population.

<div> 关键词: Mars, MAVEN, solar wind, deceleration, pickup ions
总结:<br /><br />这项研究使用Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN)获取的粒子和磁场测量数据，研究了火星弓形震波上游的太阳风减速情况。研究发现，平均太阳风减速约为初始太阳风速度的0.7%，远小于先前研究得出的数值。进一步的计算表明，这种观察到的减速与捕获离子质量装载场景是一致的。这一发现对太阳风与火星上层大气的相互作用有重要意义。 <div>
The solar wind deceleration upstream of the Martian bow shock is examined using particle and magnetic field measurements obtained by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN). Mars lacks a strong intrinsic magnetic field so its upper atmosphere extends beyond the Martian bow shock and interacts directly with the solar wind. Neutral atoms in the Martian upper atmosphere can be ionized through several physical processes and then start to move with the solar wind flow to form pickup ions. In return, the solar wind is expected to slow down due to the momentum transfer to the pickup ions. The present study surveys the MAVEN solar wind measurements between 2015 and 2019 to evaluate the solar wind deceleration upstream of the Martian bow shock. Different from previous studies of solar wind deceleration, our analysis carefully excludes the solar wind deceleration in the shock foot region. The average solar wind deceleration obtained is about 0.7% of the initial solar wind speed, much smaller than the values given by previous studies. Further calculation using several reasonable Martian upper atmosphere density profiles demonstrates that the deceleration observed is consistent with the pickup ion mass-loading scenario.

<title>The Missing Symbiotic Stars: A Joint Analysis with Gaia, GALEX, and XMM-Newton Data</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The existence of a population of low-accretion-rate symbiotic stars (SySts), consisting of a giant star and a compact companion (usually a white dwarf), has been proposed recently. However, their population has not been fully understood. In this work, we present an investigation on SySts candidates consisting of asymptotic giant branch stars (AGBs) by cross-correlating the Gaia DR3, the Galaxy Evolution Explorer All-Sky Imaging Survey, and the 4XMM DR13 catalogs. We first build a sample of AGBs within 500 pc based on their locations in the Gaia color–absolute magnitude diagram. We then explore the UV and X-ray properties of the sampled AGBs and compare them to known SySts and candidates. We find 10 SySts candidates based on the far-ultraviolet excess. The typical UV luminosity of the candidates is 1031 erg s−1, which corresponds to a typical accretion rate of 10−12–10−11M⊙ yr−1, which is more than 1 order of magnitude lower than known SySts. Based on these findings, the total number of SySts within 500 pc is estimated to be 18. The number of AGBs with X-ray flux above 10−14 erg s−1 cm−2 within 500 pc is estimated to be 37. Our finding implies that a large number of low-accretion-rate SySts are yet to be detected, which provides a base for a complete understanding of their population.

<title>Analysis of the 3.2–3.3 μm Interstellar Absorption Feature on Three Milky Way Sightlines</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1245</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report new analyses of spectra of the 3.2–3.3 μm absorption feature observed in the diffuse interstellar medium toward three Milky Way sources: 2MASS J17470898 − 2829561 (2M1747) and the Quintuplet Cluster, both located in the Galactic center, and Cygnus OB2-12. The 3.2–3.3 μm interval coincides with the CH-stretching region for compact polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We focus on the 2M1747 spectrum. Its published optical depth spectrum contains residual telluric transmission features, which arise from the 0.06 difference in mean airmasses between the observations of the source and its telluric standard star. We corrected the published spectrum by adding the airmass residual optical depth spectrum. The corrected spectrum is well fit by a superposition of four Gaussians. The absorption spectra of the other two sources were also fit by four Gaussians, with similar central wavelengths, widths, and relative peak opacities. We associate the three longer wavelength Gaussians covering the 3.23–3.31 μm interval with compact PAHs in positive, neutral, and negative charge states. We identify the shortest-wavelength Gaussian, near 3.21 μm, with irregularly shaped PAHs. Constraints imposed by spectral smoothness on the corrected 2M1747 spectrum, augmented by a PAH cluster formation model for post-asymptotic giant branch stars, suggests that >99% of the PAHs in the diffuse interstellar medium reside in small clusters. This study supports the PAH hypothesis, and it suggests that a family of primarily compact PAHs with a C66H20 (circumvalene) parent is consistent with the observed mid-infrared and ultraviolet interstellar absorption spectrum.

<div> 神经网络, 超新星, 56Ni质量, TARDIS模型, 光谱数据
总结:
本研究训练了一组基于1D辐射传输代码TARDIS的深度神经网络，用于模拟超新星爆炸后10至40天内的Ia型超新星（SNe Ia）的光学光谱。这些神经网络被应用于推导一组124个观测良好的SNe Ia样本中的速度范围在光球以上的56Ni质量。一部分SNe具有多时相观测数据，可以用56Ni的衰变来定量测试AIAI。采用观测光谱数据进行的AIAI推导的56Ni质量与56Ni的放射性衰变速率相吻合。AIAI揭示了与Ni ii 4067Å线相关的3890Å附近的光谱特征，而从AIAI中推导的56Ni质量与SNe Ia的光变曲线形状相关联，光度曲线较宽的SNe Ia在光球以上的外壳中显示出更大的56Ni质量。AIAI使得SNe的光谱数据可以在基于明确定义的物理假设的理论框架下进行定量分析。 <div>
Following our previous study of Artificial Intelligence Assisted Inversion (AIAI) of supernova analyses, we train a set of deep neural networks based on the 1D radiative transfer code TARDIS to simulate the optical spectra of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) between 10 and 40 days after the explosion. The neural networks are applied to derive the mass of 56Ni in velocity ranges above the photosphere for a sample of 124 well-observed SNe Ia in the TARDIS model context. A subset of the SNe have multi-epoch observations for which the decay of the radioactive 56Ni can be used to test the AIAI quantitatively. The 56Ni mass derived from AIAI using the observed spectra as inputs for this subset agrees with the radioactive decay rate of 56Ni. AIAI reveals that a spectral signature near 3890 Å is related to the Ni ii 4067Å line, and the 56Ni mass deduced from AIAI is found to be correlated with the light-curve shapes of SNe Ia, with SNe Ia with broader light curves showing larger 56Ni mass in the envelope above the photosphere. AIAI enables spectral data of SNe to be quantitatively analyzed under theoretical frameworks based on well-defined physical assumptions.

<br />这篇文章报告了在GOODS-S场中使用JWST/NIRCam成像和FRESCO进行的广角狭缝光谱仪成像发现了一个在z = 5.4处的极端星系过密度。通过使用λ = 0.4–5.0 μm的哈勃空间望远镜+JWST光度测定确定了过密度潜在成员。随后通过JWST狭缝光谱仪在λ = 3.9–5.0 μm范围内对Hα进行了目标线搜索，确认了5.2 < z < 5.5处81个星系，其中42个在场内，39个在密度约为随机体积的10倍的区域内。从光度测定中推断这些星系的恒星群，并构建了星系的主序，发现原星团成员相对于场内星系拥有更大的质量和更早的星形成。根据经验恒星质量到暗物质晕的关系，估计了这一大尺度结构的总暗物质质量，但由于不完整性，这可能是一个低估。我们的发现展示了JWST在非常早期的宇宙时期约束暗物质晕组装和星系形成的能力。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究使用JWST探测到了z = 5.4处的星系过密度，通过光度测定和狭缝光谱仪确认了81个星系，并研究了它们的恒星群，发现了这一大尺度结构的重要特征，展示了JWST在非常早期宇宙时期的强大能力。 <div>
We report the discovery of an extreme galaxy overdensity at z = 5.4 in the GOODS-S field using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRCam imaging from JADES and JEMS alongside JWST/NIRCam wide-field slitless spectroscopy from FRESCO. We identified potential members of the overdensity using Hubble Space Telescope+JWST photometry spanning λ = 0.4–5.0 μm. These data provide accurate and well-constrained photometric redshifts down to m ≈ 29–30 mag. We subsequently confirmed N = 81 galaxies at 5.2 < z < 5.5 using JWST slitless spectroscopy over λ = 3.9–5.0 μm through a targeted line search for Hα around the best-fit photometric redshift. We verified that N = 42 of these galaxies reside in the field, while N = 39 galaxies reside in a density around ∼10 times that of a random volume. Stellar populations for these galaxies were inferred from the photometry and used to construct the star-forming main sequence, where protocluster members appeared more massive and exhibited earlier star formation (and thus older stellar populations) when compared to their field galaxy counterparts. We estimate the total halo mass of this large-scale structure to be using an empirical stellar mass to halo mass relation, which is likely an underestimate as a result of incompleteness. Our discovery demonstrates the power of JWST at constraining dark matter halo assembly and galaxy formation at very early cosmic times.

总结:<br />
这篇文章报道了使用TESS光度测量发现了九颗新的超新星变星，它们具有负超黄短周期信号。其中三颗星在矮新星爆发期间仍具有负超黄信号，并且该信号的振幅会随着爆发的变化而变化。另外六颗星的研究较少，这是首次确定它们的轨道周期、负超黄信号和超轨道信号周期。研究还发现其中两颗星的负超黄周期和振幅会随着超轨道信号周期的变化而变化。文章指出，负超黄振幅随着爆发的变化可以成为研究负超黄来源和改进盘不稳定模型的重要依据。同时，文章也认为单一倾斜盘角度的变化不能完全解释超轨道信号的观测结果，需要考虑其他因素。 <div>
Negative superhumps (NSHs) are signals a few percent shorter than the orbital period of a binary star and are considered to originate from the reverse precession of the tilted disk. Based on TESS photometry, we find nine new cataclysmic variable stars with NSHs. Three (ASAS J1420, TZ Per, and V392 Hya) of these stars similar to AH Her still have NSHs during dwarf nova outbursts, and the NSH amplitude varies with the outburst. The variation in the radius of the accretion disk partially explains this phenomenon. However, it does not explain the rebound of the NSH amplitude after the peak of the outburst and the fact that the NSH amplitude of the quiescence is sometimes not the largest, and it is necessary to include the disk instability model (DIM) and add other ingredients. Therefore, we suggest that the variation of NSH amplitude with outburst can be an important basis for studying the origin of NSHs and improving the DIM. The six (ASASSN-V J1137, ASASSN-V J0611, 2MASS J0715, LAMOST J0925, ASASSN-17qj, and ZTF 18acakuxo) remaining stars have been poorly studied, and for the first time we determine their orbital periods, NSHs, and superorbital signal (SOR) periods. The NSH periods and amplitudes of ASASSN-V J1137 and ASASSN-17qj vary with the SOR, and based on the comparison of the observations with the theory, we suggest that a single change in tilted disk angle does not explain the observations of the SOR and that other ingredients need to be considered as well.

<br /><br />总结: Changing-look AGNs是一类特殊的活动星系核，其物理特性介于FSRQs和BL Lacs之间。通过高斯混合模型分析，研究发现CLBs可能是由于吸积过程改变而产生的过渡类型，对理解CLBs的物理特性具有重要意义。 <div>
Changing-look active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are a special class of AGNs that change their spectral type from type 1 to type 2 or vice versa. In recent years, a number of changing-look blazars (CLBs) were also reported, which transition between flat-spectrum radio quasars and BL Lacs. The physical properties of CLBs are still unclear. Using the mclust R package for Gaussian mixture modeling, we performed a clustering analysis for a sample of 105 CLBs selected from the literature. Three kinds of analysis found that CLBs lie in between the parameter distributions of FSRQs and BL Lacs: (i) univariate analysis; (ii) bivariate analysis; and (iii) multivariate analysis, carried out with a dimension reduction approach of the physical properties of the three types of blazars. Our results suggest that CLBs belong to a transition type between FSRQs and BL Lacs, which may be regulated by the change of accretion process and may be similar to other changing-look AGNs.

超大质量黑洞能够通过旋转超辐射放大入射的玻色子波，诱导超轻量玻色子围绕它们形成束缚态。这种现象有潜力限制新玻色子的参数空间。轴子和轴子样粒子（ALP）是候选的超标准模型粒子，它们可以在超大质量黑洞（SMBH）周围形成这样的尘埃云，并通过轴子-光子耦合对偏振信号产生类似法拉第旋转的影响。之前的努力利用事件视界望远镜（EHT）M87 2017年观测的偏振图像来限制无量纲轴子-光子耦合到以前未曾探索的区域。然而，借助新的校准不敏感量、闭合迹和共轭闭合迹积，可以约束轴子云的存在，同时避免系统误差的主要来源，例如站点增益和极化泄漏。我们利用M87*的偏振图的简单几何模型，通过模拟和实际数据集拟合模型参数，并在M87中达到了可比较的排除轴子云的精度水平。我们的方法的未来应用包括事件视界望远镜和下一代事件视界望远镜对M87*和Sgr A*的观测，预计将在更广泛的轴子和ALP质量范围内产生更强的约束。由于它不需要成像，闭合迹分析可以应用于成像边缘的目标活动星系核，大大扩展了可以从中得到轴子限制的超大质量黑洞的数量。 <br /><br />总结:黑洞可以通过超旋转辐射放大入射的玻色子波，诱导围绕它们形成束缚态。轴子和轴子样粒子可以形成尘埃云并影响偏振信号。利用闭合迹分析可以约束轴子云的存在，避免系统误差。未来的观测预计会产生更强的约束，扩展了限制轴子的超大质量黑洞的范围。 <div>
Black holes can amplify incoming bosonic waves via rotational superradiance, inducing bound states of ultralight bosons around them. This phenomenon has the potential to confine the parameter spaces of new bosons. Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) are candidate beyond-standard-model particles that can form such clouds around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and impact the polarization signal in a similar fashion to Faraday rotation via axion–photon coupling. Prior efforts have used polarized images from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) M87 2017 observations to limit the dimensionless axion–photon coupling to previously unexplored regions. However, with the novel calibration-insensitive quantities, closure traces, and conjugate closure trace products, it is possible to constrain the existence of axion clouds while avoiding the dominant sources of systematic uncertainties, e.g., station gains and polarization leakages. We utilize a simple geometric model for the polarization map of M87* to fit the model parameters with both simulated and real data sets and reach a comparable level of constraint in the accuracy with which an axion cloud may be excluded in M87. Future applications of our approach include subsequent M87* and Sgr A* observations by EHT and the next-generation EHT that are expected to produce stronger constraints across a wider range of axion and ALP masses. Because it does not require imaging, closure trace analyses may be applied to target active galactic nuclei for which imaging is marginal, extending the number of SMBHs from which axion limits may be obtained significantly.

The structure and dynamics of the star-forming disk of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) have long confounded us. The SMC is widely used as a prototype for galactic physics at low metallicity, and yet we fundamentally lack an understanding of the structure of its interstellar medium (ISM). In this work, we present a new model for the SMC by comparing the kinematics of young, massive stars with the structure of the ISM traced by high-resolution observations of neutral atomic hydrogen (H i) from the Galactic Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder survey. Specifically, we identify thousands of young, massive stars with precise radial velocity constraints from the Gaia and APOGEE surveys and match these stars to the ISM structures in which they likely formed. By comparing the average dust extinction toward these stars, we find evidence that the SMC is composed of two structures with distinct stellar and gaseous chemical compositions. We construct a simple model that successfully reproduces the observations and shows that the ISM of the SMC is arranged into two superimposed, star-forming systems with similar gas mass separated by ∼5 kpc along the line of sight.

<div> NOEMA, CO, H2O, quasars, excitation
总结:
本研究使用NOEMA对两个红移约为6的类星体进行了观测，发现它们的CO谱线能量分布（SLED）分别显示出最高和最低的激发水平。对P215−16进行的辐射传输建模表明，由活动星系核加热的分子气体可能是高CO激发的合理来源。而对J1429+5447的CO SLED分析显示，来自单个光解区的成分可以解释这个射电明亮类星体中的CO激发。这项工作突显了CO SLED在揭示红移最高的年轻类星体-星爆系统中的星际介质属性方面的实用性。CO SLED的多样性揭示了这些早期演化阶段的气体条件和激发机制的复杂性。 <div>
We present observations using the Northern Extended Millimetre Array (NOEMA) of CO and H2O emission lines and the underlying dust continuum in two quasars at z ∼ 6, i.e., P215−16 at z = 5.78 and J1429+5447 at z = 6.18. Notably, among all published CO spectral line energy distributions (SLEDs) of quasars at z ∼ 6, the two systems reveal the highest and the lowest CO levels of excitation, respectively. Our radiative transfer modeling of the CO SLED of P215−16 suggests that the molecular gas heated by active galactic nuclei could be a plausible origin for the high CO excitation. For J1429+5447, we obtain the first well-sampled CO SLED (from transitions from 2−1 to 10−9) of a radio-loud quasar at z ≳ 6. Analysis of the CO SLED suggests that a component from a single photodissociation region could explain the CO excitation in the radio-loud quasar J1429+5447. This work highlights the utility of the CO SLED in uncovering the properties of the interstellar medium in these young quasar–starburst systems at the highest redshift. The diversity of the CO SLEDs reveals the complexities in gas conditions and excitation mechanisms at their early evolutionary stage.

<div> 关键词: 太阳式振荡，恒星质量，金属丰度，三维模拟，尺度关系<br />
总结: <br />
该研究利用现代空间任务探测到的太阳式振荡，对成千上万颗恒星的质量和年龄进行测量，并应用于银河考古学研究。研究表明，尺度关系并非只与有效温度和表面重力成正比，而是受金属丰度影响。通过进行三维近表面对流模拟，研究发现振荡频率与金属丰度呈负相关，与之前使用一维模型得出的正相关结果矛盾。此外，研究对振动速度进行理论估计，结果表明在太阳的有效温度和表面重力下，并不呈现出与金属丰度的相关性。这一研究提出了一个令人兴奋的前景，即通过真实的三维流体动力学恒星模型来测试天体测震尺度关系。 <br /> <div>
Solar-like oscillations have been detected in thousands of stars thanks to modern space missions. These oscillations have been used to measure stellar masses and ages, which have been widely applied in Galactic archeology. One of the pillars of such applications is the scaling relation: the frequency of maximum power , assumed to be proportional to the acoustic cutoff frequency, νac, scales with effective temperature and surface gravity. However, the theoretical basis of the scaling relation is uncertain, and there is an ongoing debate about whether it can be applied to metal-poor stars. We investigate the metallicity dependence of the scaling relation by carrying out 3D near-surface convection simulations for solar-type stars with [Fe/H] between −3 and 0.5 dex. First, we found a negative correlation between νac and metallicity from the 3D models. This is in tension with the positive correlation identified by studies using 1D models. Second, we estimated theoretical values using velocity amplitudes determined from first principles, by quantifying the mode excitation and damping rates with methods validated in our previous works. We found that does not show correlation with metallicity at solar effective temperature and surface gravity. This study opens an exciting prospect of testing the asteroseismic scaling relations against realistic 3D hydrodynamical stellar models.

<div> 关键词: SN-associated GRB, multiwavelength properties, afterglow, central engine, top-hat jet model

总结:
本研究深入探讨了附近超新星（SN）相关的低亮度伽马射线暴（GRB）171205A的多波段特性，以综合限制其物理起源。我们发现脉冲宽度与能量呈幂律关系，这与其他SN/GRBs的指数一致，但大于长GRBs的指数。分析预警伽马射线和X射线平台的总体光变曲线后，推断早期X射线和伽马射线应反映了中心发动机的活动，而晚期X射线可能受外部冲击与周围物质的相互作用的影响。此外，我们发现GRB 171205A的宿主无线电流量和偏移与其他附近低亮度GRB的情况相似。采用九个带有测定偏移的SN/GRB建立了峰值光度（Lγ,p）与谱滞后（τ）之间的关系，得到Lγ,p ∝ τ−1.91±0.33。发现12个SN/GRB和10个长寿命超新星相关的GRB的峰值光度和投影物理偏移之间有适度的相关性，暗示它们具有不同的祖先。通过顶帽形射流模型拟合的多波段余辉表明，GRB 171205A的射流半展开角和视角分别约为34.°4和41.°8，暗示正面以外的发射受到外周囊层的主导，而不是射流核心。 <div>
Multiwavelength properties of the nearby supernova (SN)-associated low-luminosity GRB 171205A are investigated in depth to constrain its physical origin synthetically. The pulse width is found to be correlated with energy with a power-law index of −0.24 ± 0.07, which is consistent with the indices of other SN-associated gamma-ray bursts (SN/GRBs) but larger than those of long GRBs. By analyzing the overall light curve of its prompt gamma rays and X-ray plateaus simultaneously, we infer that the early X-rays together with the gamma-rays should reflect the activities of the central engine, while the late X-rays may be dominated by the interaction of external shocks with circumburst material. In addition, we find that the host radio flux and offset of GRB 171205A are similar to those of other nearby low-luminosity GRBs. We adopt nine SN/GRBs with measured offset to build a relation between peak luminosity (Lγ,p) and spectral lag (τ) as Lγ,p ∝ τ−1.91±0.33. The peak luminosity and the projected physical offset of 12 SN/GRBs and 10 kilonova-associated GRBs are found to be moderately correlated, suggesting their different progenitors. The multiwavelength afterglow fitted with a top-hat jet model indicates that the jet half-opening angle and the viewing angle of GRB 171205A are ∼34.°4 and 41.°8, respectively, which implies that the off-axis emissions are dominated by the peripheral cocoon rather than the jet core.

Black hole (BH) X-ray binaries (XRBs) are ideal targets to study the connection between accretion inflow and jet outflow. Here we present quasi-simultaneous, multiwavelength observations of the Galactic BH system MAXI J1820+070, throughout its 2018–2019 outburst. Our data set includes coverage from the radio through X-ray bands from 17 different instruments/telescopes, and encompasses 19 epochs over a 7 month period, resulting in one of the most well-sampled multiwavelength data sets of a BH XRB outburst to date. With our data, we compile and model the broadband spectra of this source using a phenomenological model that includes emission from the jet, a companion star, and an accretion flow. This modeling allows us to track the evolution of the spectral break in the jet spectrum, a key observable that samples the jet launching region. We find that the spectral break location changes over at least ≈3 orders of magnitude in electromagnetic frequency over this period. Using these spectral break measurements, we link the full cycle of jet behavior, including the rising, quenching, and reignition, to the changing accretion flow properties as the source evolves through its different accretion states. Our analysis shows consistent jet behavior with other sources in similar phases of their outbursts, reinforcing the idea that jet quenching and recovery may be a global feature of BH XRB systems in outburst. Our results also provide valuable evidence supporting a close connection between the geometry of the inner accretion flow and the base of the jet.

<title>Jet Structure and Burst Environment of GRB 221009A</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We conducted a comprehensive investigation of the brightest-of-all-time GRB 221009A, using new insights from very high-energy (VHE) observations from LHAASO and a complete multiwavelength afterglow data set. Through data fitting, we imposed constraints on the jet structure, radiation mechanisms, and burst environment of GRB 221009A. Our findings reveal a structured jet morphology characterized by a core+wing configuration. A smooth transition of energy within the jet takes place between the core and wing, but with a discontinuity in the bulk Lorentz factor. The jet structure differs from both the case of the short GRB 170817A and the results of numerical simulations for long-duration bursts. The VHE emission can be explained by the forward shock synchrotron self-Compton radiation of the core component, but requiring a distinctive transition of the burst environment from uniform to wind-like, suggesting the presence of complex pre-burst mass ejection processes. The low-energy multiwavelength afterglow is mainly governed by the synchrotron radiation from the forward and reverse shocks of the wing component. Our analysis indicates a magnetization factor of 5 for the wing component. Additionally, by comparing the forward shock parameters of the core and wing components, we find a potential correlation between the electron acceleration efficiency and both the Lorentz factor of the shock and the magnetic field equipartition factor. We discuss the significance of our findings, potential interpretations, and remaining issues.

<div> SN 2022oqm, Type Ic supernova, early-time spectral observations, CSM, shock cooling

总结:<br />
SN 2022oqm是一次Ic型超新星，早期光谱观测显示出高离子化的碳和氧吸收特征，指示着存在扩展的C/O物质。光谱和光曲线的演变表明，这次超新星最初的行为可以通过与光学薄的CSM的相互作用以及激冷来解释。在t = 60天时，SN 2022oqm的光谱显示出强烈的Ca ii和[Ca ii]发射，没有检测到[O i]，标志着这个事件是富含Ca的。因此，观测结果支持了三种潜在的解释：一个质量庞大的致密前体、一个带有延伸包层的质量剥离前体，或者一个含有白矮星的双星系统。 <div>
We present the discovery and analysis of SN 2022oqm, a Type Ic supernova (SN) detected <1 day after the explosion. The SN rises to a blue and short-lived (2 days) initial peak. Early-time spectral observations of SN 2022oqm show a hot (40,000 K) continuum with high ionization C and O absorption features at velocities of 4000 km s−1, while its photospheric radius expands at 20,000 km s−1, indicating a pre-existing distribution of expanding C/O material. After ∼2.5 days, both the spectrum and light curves evolve into those of a typical SN Ic, with line velocities of ∼10,000 km s−1, in agreement with the evolution of the photospheric radius. The optical light curves reach a second peak at t ≈ 15 days. By t = 60 days, the spectrum of SN 2022oqm becomes nearly nebular, displaying strong Ca ii and [Ca ii] emission with no detectable [O i], marking this event as Ca-rich. The early behavior can be explained by 10−3M⊙ of optically thin circumstellar material (CSM) surrounding either (1) a massive compact progenitor such as a Wolf–Rayet star, (2) a massive stripped progenitor with an extended envelope, or (3) a binary system with a white dwarf. We propose that the early-time light curve is powered by both the interaction of the ejecta with the optically thin CSM and shock cooling (in the massive star scenario). The observations can be explained by CSM that is optically thick to X-ray photons, is optically thick in the lines as seen in the spectra, and is optically thin to visible-light continuum photons that come either from downscattered X-rays or from the shock-heated ejecta. Calculations show that this scenario is self-consistent.

总结: 
这篇文章研究了SPRC047周围的星体群，使用星体的光谱能量分布来分析星体群的性质，尝试通过分段来获取最佳拟合结果。作者使用了多种星体形成历史先验来进行拟合，并指出由于波长覆盖不足和光信噪比低，无法解决年龄-金属丰度-尘埃的退化问题。作者还讨论了未来深度的可见-近红外观测结合绝对光通量校准的重要性，以及中等紫外线和中红外波段的观测将如何提高宽带SED拟合结果的准确性，从而改进类似未解析成星体的邻近星系周围的低表面亮度目标的研究。 <div>
We have investigated the properties (e.g., age, metallicity) of the stellar populations of a ringlike tidal stellar stream (or streams) around the edge-on galaxy SPRC047 (z = 0.031) using spectral energy distribution (SED) fits to integrated broadband aperture flux densities. We used visual images in six different bands and Spitzer/IRAC 3.6 μm data. We have attempted to derive best-fit stellar population parameters (metallicity, age) in three noncontiguous segments of the stream. Due to the very low surface brightness of the stream, we have performed a deconvolution with a Richardson–Lucy–type algorithm of the low spatial resolution 3.6 μm IRAC image, thereby reducing the effect of the point-spread function aliased emission from the bright edge-on central galaxy at the locations of our three stream segments. Our SED fits that used several different star formation (SF) history priors, from an exponentially decaying SF burst to continuous SF, indicate that the age–metallicity–dust degeneracy is not resolved, most likely because of inadequate wavelength coverage and low signal-to-noise ratios of the low surface brightness features. We also discuss how future deep visual–near-infrared observations, combined with absolute flux calibration uncertainties at or below the 1% level, complemented by equally well absolute flux-calibrated observations in ultraviolet and mid-infrared bands, would improve the accuracy of broadband SED fitting results for low surface brightness targets, such as stellar streams around nearby galaxies that are not resolved into stars.

<div> 关键词: Quasars, quadruply lensed, Malmquist-like selection effect, time delays, Hubble constant
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了四重透镜的夸萨尔星系的选择效应和对哈勃常数的影响。文章指出四重透镜只有在其位于透镜星系的钻石焦散线内时才发生。这会导致观测到的四重透镜夸萨尔星系的选择效应，高估了真实的焦散区域。并且文章提到了Malmquist的修正可以补偿参数优化中未能将先验因素纳入计算的失败。另外，推断的时间延迟与透镜星系的推断焦散区域成正比。模型时间延迟的偏差长，导致哈勃常数被高估。由于选择效应和模型放大率错误的组合产生了“推断放大率偏差”。这些效应可以被内置为先验，但在实践中可能具有挑战性。 <div>
Quasars are quadruply lensed only when they lie within the diamond caustic of a lensing galaxy. This precondition produces a Malmquist-like selection effect in observed populations of quadruply lensed quasars, overestimating the true caustic area. The bias toward high values of the inferred logarithmic area, , is proportional to the square of the error in that area, . In effect, Malmquist’s correction compensates posthoc for a failure to incorporate a prior into parameter optimization. Inferred time delays are proportional to the square root of the inferred caustic area of the lensing galaxy. Model time delays are biased long, leading to overestimates of the Hubble constant. Crude estimates of for a sample of 13 quadruple systems give a median value of 0.16. We identify a second effect, an “inferred magnification bias,” resulting from the combination of selection by apparent magnitude and errors in model magnification. It is strongly anticorrelated with caustic area bias, and almost always leads to underestimates of the Hubble constant. Malmquist’s scheme can be adapted to priors on multiple parameters, but for quad lenses, the negative covariances between caustic area and absolute magnitude are poorly known. Inferred magnification bias may even cancel out caustic area bias, depending upon (among other things) the slope of the number–magnitude relation for the sample. Proper correction for these combined effects can, in principle, be built into Bayesian modeling schemes as priors, eliminating the need for a Malmquist-style approximation, but is likely to be challenging in practice.

Ice chemistry in the dense, cold interstellar medium (ISM) is probably responsible for the formation of interstellar complex organic molecules (COMs). Recent laboratory experiments performed at T ∼ 4 K have shown that irradiation of CO:N2 ice samples analog to the CO-rich interstellar ice layer can contribute to the formation of COMs when H2 molecules are present. We have tested this organic chemistry under a broader range of conditions relevant to the interior of dense clouds by irradiating CO:15N2:H2 ice samples with 2 keV electrons in the 4–15 K temperature range. The H2 ice abundance depended on both, the ice formation temperature and the thermal evolution of the samples. Formation of H-bearing organics such as formaldehyde (H2CO), ketene (C2H2O), and isocyanic acid (H15NCO) was observed upon irradiation of ice samples formed at temperatures up to 10 K, and also in ices formed at 6 K and subsequently warmed up and irradiated at temperatures up to 15 K. These results suggest that a fraction of the H2 molecules in dense cloud interiors might be entrapped in the CO-rich layer of interstellar ice mantles, and that energetic processing of this layer could entail an additional contribution to the formation of COMs in the coldest regions of the ISM.

Atmospheric escape is crucial to understanding the evolution of planets in and out of the solar system and to interpreting atmospheric observations. While hydrodynamic escape simulations have been actively developed incorporating detailed processes such as UV heating, chemical reactions, and radiative cooling, the radiative cooling by molecules has been treated as emission from selected lines or rotational/vibrational bands to reduce its numerical cost. However, ad hoc selections of radiative lines would risk estimating inaccurate cooling rates because important lines or wavelengths for atmospheric cooling depend on emitting conditions such as temperature and optical thickness. In this study, we apply the correlated-k distribution (CKD) method to cooling rate calculations for H2-dominant transonic atmospheres containing H2O or CO as radiative species, to investigate its numerical performance and the importance of considering all lines of the molecules. Our simulations demonstrate that the sum of weak lines, which provides only 1% of the line emission energy in total at optically thin conditions, can become the primary source of radiative cooling in optically thick regions, especially for H2O-containing atmospheres. Also, in our hydrodynamic simulations, the CKD method with a wavelength resolution of 1000 is found to be effective, allowing the calculation of escape rate and temperature profiles with acceptable numerical cost. Our results show the importance of treating all radiative lines and the usefulness of the CKD method in hydrodynamic escape simulations. It is particularly practical for heavy-element-enriched atmospheres considered in small exoplanets, including super-Earths, without any prior selections for effective lines.

在研究太阳日冕加热问题时，我们通常只能观测到活跃区环的冷却阶段。然而，通过Hinode/EUV成像光谱仪(EIS)的罕见观测，我们得以观察到了X2.1型耀斑后日冕雨的形成过程。通过对等离子体成分的测量，我们发现了日冕雨形成的迹象。此外，通过多种测量手段，我们还观察到了日冕雨的形成和演化过程。这些观测为我们提供了关于日冕雨加热速率、来源和集体行为的新见解。在观测中还发现了日冕雨的一些特性，如在0.7MK时的窄温度分布。这些观测为解决日冕加热问题提供了重要线索。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
A significant impediment to solving the coronal heating problem is that we currently only observe active region loops in their cooling phase. Previous studies showed that the evolution of cooling loop densities and apex temperatures is insensitive to the magnitude, duration, and location of energy deposition. Still, potential clues to how energy is released are encoded in the properties of the cooling phase. The appearance of coronal rain, one of the most spectacular phenomena of the cooling phase, occurs when plasma has cooled below 1 MK, which sets constraints on the heating frequency, for example. Most observations of coronal rain have been made by imaging instruments. Here we report rare Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) observations of a loop arcade where coronal rain forms following an X2.1 limb flare. A bifurcation in plasma composition measurements between photospheric at 1.5 MK and coronal at 3.5 MK suggests that we are observing postflare-driven coronal rain. Increases in nonthermal velocities and densities with decreasing temperature (2.7–0.6 MK) suggest that we are observing the formation and subsequent evolution of the condensations. Doppler velocity measurements imply that a 10% correction of apparent flows in imaging data is reasonable. Emission measure analysis at 0.7 MK shows narrow temperature distributions, indicating coherent behavior reminiscent of that observed in coronal loops. The limitations on spatio-temporal resolution of EIS suggest that we are observing the largest features or rain showers. These observations provide insights into the heating rate, source, turbulence, and collective behavior of coronal rain from observations of the loop cooling phase.

We compare the fluxes of [Ne III] 3869 Å, [O III] 5007 Å, [O II] 3726, 3728 Å, and [O i] 6300 Å to that of [Ne v]. All four lines show a strong linear correlation with [Ne v], although lines from ions with lower ionization potentials have a lower correlation coefficient. We investigate the use of two forbidden line ratio diagnostic diagrams that do not rely on Hα in order to classify high-redshift galaxies. These use the [Ne III]/[O II] line ratio plotted against [O III]/[O i] and [O III]/[O II], respectively. We use photoionization modeling to characterize the behavior of the narrow-line region in AGN and star-forming regions and test the validity of our diagnostic diagrams. We also use a luminosity cutoff of log L[O III] [erg s−1] = 42, which lowers the contamination of the AGN region by star-forming galaxies down to 10% but does not remove green pea and purple grape galaxies from the AGN region. We also investigate the OHNO diagram, which uses [Ne III]/[O II] plotted against [O III]/Hβ. Using our new diagnostic diagrams, we are able to reliably classify AGN up to a redshift of z ≤ 1.06 and add more than 822 new AGN to the [Ne v]-selected AGN sample.

在这篇文章中，研究人员通过对类星体的X射线和紫外线亮度之间的关系进行比较，使用了观测数据和统计工具copula构建了三种不同的LX-LUV关系，其中包括标准关系和两种红移演化关系。通过对低红移和高红移数据进行分析，发现使用红移演化关系得到的PAge参数的约束与标准关系相一致，而使用考虑了红移依赖修正的关系时则不一致。当同时使用数据来约束关系的系数和PAge参数时，观测数据支持红移演化关系，显著性超过3σ。而阿凯凯信息准则和贝叶斯信息准则表明，标准关系被强烈拒绝，而红移演化关系也存在轻微拒绝的迹象。这表明，使用copula构建的类星体LX-LUV关系受到了观测数据的支持。 <br /><br />总结: 研究比较了不同的LX-LUV关系，发现红移演化关系得到的PAge参数在低红移和高红移数据中是一致的，而标准关系则不一致。观测数据支持红移演化关系，既有3σ的显著性。信息准则表明标准关系被强烈拒绝，而红移演化关系也存在轻微拒绝的迹象。这表明了使用copula构建的LX-LUV关系受到了观测数据的支持。 <div>
We compare, with data from quasars, Hubble parameter measurements, and Pantheon+ type Ia supernova, three different relations between X-ray luminosity (LX) and ultraviolet luminosity (LUV) of quasars. These three relations consist of the standard and two redshift-evolutionary LX–LUV relations, which are constructed, respectively, by considering a redshift-dependent correction to the luminosities of quasars and using the statistical tool copula. By employing the PAge approximation for a cosmological model–independent description of the cosmic background evolution and dividing the quasar data into the low-redshift and high-redshift parts, we find that the constraints on the PAge parameters from the low-redshift and high-redshift data, which are obtained with the redshift-evolutionary relations, are consistent with each other, while they are not when the standard relation is considered. If the data are used to constrain the coefficients of the relations and the PAge parameters simultaneously, then the observations support the redshift-evolutionary relations at more than 3σ. The Akaike and Bayes information criteria indicate that there is strong evidence against the standard relation and mild evidence against the redshift-evolutionary relation constructed by considering a redshift-dependent correction to the luminosities of quasars. This suggests that the redshift-evolutionary LX–LUV relation of quasars constructed from copula is favored by the observations.

<title>Absorption Troughs of Lyα Emitters in HETDEX</title>

<br /><br />
该文介绍了HETDEX项目，旨在探测和测量超过100万个Lyα发射星系的红移，从而得出宇宙学测量数据，并研究Lyα光谱和辐射传输的基本特性。通过HETDEX数据发布3中的50万个LAEs，研究人员对不同子集进行堆叠，得出了z∼2–3时代典型的Lyα谱线，并了解了它们的物理特性。他们发现Lyα发射周围清晰的吸收翼，红蓝两侧均延伸∼2000 km/s。同时，通过COS和MUSE调查，他们观察到不同红移范围内的吸收谱线，并发现槽在高密度区域更加明显，说明吸收深度取决于LAE附近的局部密度。简单的Lyα辐射传输模拟也产生了类似的槽，这是由LAE周围的H i气体吸收背景光造成的。 
<br /><br />总结: 该研究通过HETDEX项目找到了z∼2–3时代典型的Lyα谱线，发现了吸收翼的特性，并观察到了吸收谱线与密度的关联。通过简单模拟，也验证了H i气体对光的吸收会产生类似的效应。 <div>
The Hobby–Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) is designed to detect and measure the redshifts of more than 1 million Lyα emitting galaxies (LAEs) 1.88 < z < 3.52. In addition to its cosmological measurements, these data enable studies of Lyα spectral profiles and the underlying radiative transfer. Using the roughly half a million LAEs in the HETDEX Data Release 3, we stack various subsets to obtain the typical Lyα profile for the z ∼ 2–3 epoch and to understand their physical properties. We find clear absorption wings around Lyα emission, which extend ∼2000 km s−1 both redward and blueward of the central line. Using far-UV spectra of nearby (0.002 < z < 0.182) LAEs in the COS Legacy Archive Spectroscopic Survey treasury and optical/near-IR spectra of 2.8 < z < 6.7 LAEs in the Multi Unit Spectroscopic-Wide survey, we observe absorption profiles in both redshift regimes. Dividing the sample by volume density shows that the troughs increase in higher-density regions. This trend suggests that the depth of the absorption is dependent on the local density of objects near the LAE, a geometry that is similar to damped Lyα systems. Simple simulations of Lyα radiative transfer can produce similar troughs due to absorption of light from background sources by H i gas surrounding the LAEs.

<div> 黑洞自旋参数；X射线双星；LMC X-1；尼科尔斯观测望远镜；恒星质量黑洞

总结:
本研究利用NICER和NuSTAR的最新同时观测数据，通过改进的科研方法对黑洞的自旋参数进行测量。首先使用标准相对论盘模型和光学薄的康普顿散射模型得到与以往相似的自旋参数数值。然后考虑了标准模型的修正，使用颜色校正得到了不同的自旋参数范围。进一步考虑了盘面层的能量耗散，假设标准盘被一个温暖且光学厚的康普顿散射层覆盖。最终得到了一个最小的χ2值对应的自旋参数范围。接着，我们对银河系X-1进行了相似的研究，结果表明，使用连续谱方法测量自旋参数极其敏感于对盘结构的假设。 <div>
The black hole spin parameter, a*, was measured to be close to its maximum value of 1 in many accreting X-ray binaries. In particular, a* ≳ 0.9 was found in a number of studies of LMC X-1. These measurements were claimed to take into account both statistical and systematic uncertainties. We perform new measurements using a recent simultaneous observation by NICER and NuSTAR, providing a data set of high quality. We use the disk continuum method together with improved models for coronal Comptonization. With the standard relativistic disk model and optically thin Comptonization, we obtain values of a* similar to those obtained before. We then consider modifications to the standard model. Using a color correction of 2, we find a* ≈ 0.64–0.84. We then consider disks with dissipation in surface layers. To account for that, we assume the standard disk is covered by a warm and optically thick Comptonizing layer. Our model with the lowest χ2 then yields . In order to test the presence of such effects in other sources, we also study an X-ray observation of Cyg X-1 by Suzaku in the soft state. We confirm the previous findings of a* > 0.99 using the standard model, but then we find a weakly constrained when including an optically thick Comptonizing layer. We conclude that determinations of the spin using the continuum method can be highly sensitive to the assumptions about the disk structure.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The galaxy cluster A746 (z = 0.214), featuring a double radio relic system, two isolated radio relics, a possible radio halo, disturbed V-shaped X-ray emission, and intricate galaxy distributions, is a unique and complex merging system. We present a weak-lensing analysis of A746 based on wide-field imaging data from Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam observations. The mass distribution is characterized by a main peak, which coincides with the center of the X-ray emission. At this main peak, we detect two extensions toward the north and west tracing the cluster galaxy and X-ray distributions. Despite the ongoing merger, our estimate of the A746 global mass M500 = 4.4 ± 1.0 × 1014M⊙ is consistent with the previous results from Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and X-ray observations. We conclude that reconciling the distributions of mass, galaxies, and intracluster medium with the double radio relic system and other radio features remains challenging.

<title>Including Neutrino-driven Convection in the Force Explosion Condition to Predict Explodability of Multidimensional Core-collapse Supernovae (FEC+)</title>

Most massive stars end their lives with core collapse. However, it is not clear which explode as a core-collapse supernova (CCSN), leaving behind a neutron star, and which collapse to a black hole, aborting the explosion. One path to predict explodability without expensive multidimensional simulations is to develop analytic explosion conditions. These analytic conditions also provide a deeper understanding of the explosion mechanism and they provide some insight into why some simulations explode and some do not. The analytic force explosion condition (FEC) reproduces the explosion conditions of spherically symmetric CCSN simulations. In this follow-up manuscript, we include the dominant multidimensional effect that aids explosion—neutrino-driven convection—in the FEC. This generalized critical condition (FEC+) is suitable for multidimensional simulations and has potential to accurately predict explosion conditions of two- and three-dimensional CCSN simulations. We show that adding neutrino-driven convection reduces the critical condition by ∼30%, which is consistent with previous multidimensional simulations.

在当前JWST时代，UV光谱对于增进我们对复离子时代（z > 6）中第一批星系的星际介质（ISM）和恒星特性的理解起着至关重要的作用。本文利用HST COS Legacy Archive Spectroscopic SurveY（CLASSY）中的远紫外线（UV）光谱数据，比较了光学图谱和UV图谱之间的关系，分析了在不同UV诊断图中的UV线比的位置，并考虑了最新的光电离和激波模型，以及已测得的ISM和恒星特性。研究发现，C iii] λλ1907,9 He iiλ1640和O iii] λ1666的组合可以在次太阳金属丰度条件下有效区分星际介质的形成源。此外，文中还讨论了检测UV发射线所需的ISM条件，强调了它们仅在低气相金属丰度（12 + log(O/H) ≲ 8.3）和高电离参数（log(U) ≳ −2.5）的环境中可见。总的来说，CLASSY和UV工具将在解释JWST目前正在揭示的最早星系的光谱方面发挥关键作用。<br /><br />总结: 本文利用CLASSY收集的大量UV光谱数据，比较了UV和光学图谱之间的关系，分析了UV线比的位置，并讨论了检测UV发射线所需的ISM条件。研究发现特定的UV线比组合可以区分不同形成源，而UV发射线仅在特定环境下可见。这将对解释JWST发现的早期星系的光谱起到关键作用。 <div>
In the current JWST era, rest-frame UV spectra play a crucial role in enhancing our understanding of the interstellar medium (ISM) and stellar properties of the first galaxies in the epoch of reionization (z > 6). Here, we compare well-known and reliable optical diagrams sensitive to the main ionization source (i.e., star formation, SF; active galactic nuclei, AGN; and shocks) to UV counterparts proposed in the literature—the so-called “UV–BPT diagrams”—using the HST COS Legacy Archive Spectroscopic SurveY (CLASSY), which is the largest high-quality, high-resolution, and broad-wavelength range atlas of far-UV spectra for 45 local star-forming galaxies. In particular, we explore where CLASSY UV line ratios are located in the different UV diagnostic plots, taking into account state-of-the-art photoionization and shock models, and, for the first time, the measured ISM and stellar properties (e.g., gas-phase metallicity, ionization parameter, carbon abundance, and stellar age). We find that the combination of C iii] λλ1907,9 He iiλ1640 and O iii] λ1666 can be a powerful tool to separate between SF, shocks, and AGN at subsolar metallicities. We also confirm that alternative diagrams without O iii] λ1666 still allow us to define an SF-locus, with some caveats. Diagrams including C ivλλ1548,51 should be taken with caution given the complexity of this doublet profile. Finally, we present a discussion detailing the ISM conditions required to detect UV emission lines, visible only in low gas-phase metallicity (12 + log(O/H) ≲ 8.3) and high ionization parameter (log(U) ≳ −2.5) environments. Overall, CLASSY and our UV toolkit will be crucial in interpreting the spectra of the earliest galaxies that JWST is currently revealing.

这篇文章总结了针对COSMOS-Web宝库项目的JWST NIRCam成像数据进行了详细和全面的数据降维和点扩散函数（PSF）模型构建。研究发现NIRCam PSF在四个滤波器（F115W，F150W，F277W和F444W）中存在显著的短时间尺度的时间变化和随机空间变化。通过将NIRCam与哈勃太空望远镜成像数据结合起来，进行多波段活动星系核（AGN）+宿主图像分解，研究了0.35 ≲ z ≲ 3.5的143个X射线选择的宽线AGN的特性。研究利用NIRCam出色的分辨率、波长覆盖和灵敏度，成功在142个对象中分解出中心AGN点源后检测到宿主恒星发射。约2/3的AGN位于星成形星系中，表明没有即时的负面AGN反馈。X射线选择的宽线AGN宿主遵循与非活跃星系类似的恒星质量-尺寸关系，尽管其星系大小略小。研究发现，尽管主要并合在样本中很少（约7%–22%），但来自恒星棒、螺旋臂和小并合等更微妙的非轴对称特征是普遍存在的，突出了非周期过程和小并合在触发AGN活动中的重要性。对于具有来自单一时期光谱的黑洞质量测量的30个AGN子样本（1 < z < 2.5），它们遵循与当地非活跃早期星系相似的黑洞质量-恒星质量关系，但更倾向于驻留在附近AGN的上限。需要注意的是，不同红移下的AGN种群的固有差异可能会显着影响它们在黑洞质量-恒星质量平面上的位置。

We present detailed and comprehensive data reduction and point-spread-function (PSF) model construction for all public JWST NIRCam imaging data from the COSMOS-Web treasury program (up to 2023 June, totaling 0.28 deg2). We show that the NIRCam PSF has significant short-timescale temporal variations and random spatial variations in all four filters (F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W). Combining NIRCam with archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging, we perform multiwavelength active galactic nucleus (AGN)+host image decomposition to study the properties of 143 X-ray-selected (Lbol = 1043.6–47.2 erg s−1) broad-line AGNs at 0.35 ≲ z ≲ 3.5. Leveraging the superb resolution, wavelength coverage, and sensitivity of NIRCam, we successfully detect host stellar emission after decomposing the central AGN point source in 142 objects. ∼2/3 AGNs are in star-forming galaxies based on the UVJ diagram, suggesting that there is no instantaneous negative AGN feedback. X-ray-selected broad-line AGN hosts follow a similar stellar mass–size relation as inactive galaxies, albeit with slightly smaller galaxy sizes. We find that although major mergers are rare (∼7%–22%) among the sample, more subtle nonaxisymmetric features from stellar bars, spiral arms, and minor mergers are ubiquitous, highlighting the importance of secular processes and minor mergers in triggering AGN activity. For a subsample of 30 AGNs at 1 < z < 2.5 with black hole mass measurements from single epoch spectra, they follow a similar black hole mass-stellar mass relation as local inactive early-type galaxies but reside preferentially near the upper envelope of nearby AGNs. We caution that selection biases and the intrinsic differences of AGN populations at different redshifts may significantly affect their location on the black hole mass-stellar mass plane.

AU Microscopii (AU Mic) is an active 24 ± 3 Myr pre-main-sequence M dwarf in the stellar neighborhood (d = 9.7 pc) with a rotation period of 4.86 days. The two transiting planets orbiting AU Mic, AU Mic b and c, are warm sub-Neptunes on 8.5 and 18.9 day periods and are targets of interest for atmospheric observations of young planets. Here we study AU Mic’s unocculted starspots using ground-based photometry and spectra in order to complement current and future transmission spectroscopy of its planets. We gathered multicolor Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) 0.4 m SBIG photometry to study the star's rotational modulations and LCO Network of Robotic Echelle Spectrographs high-resolution spectra to measure the different spectral components within the integrated spectrum of the star, parameterized by three spectral components and their coverage fractions. We find AU Mic’s surface has at least two spectral components: a Tamb = K ambient photosphere and cool spots that have a temperature of Tspot = K, covering a globally averaged area of 39% ± 4% which increases and decreases by 5.1% ± 0.3% from the average throughout a rotation. We also detect a third flux component with a filling factor less than 0.5% and a largely uncertain temperature between 8500 and 10,000 K that we attribute to flare flux not entirely omitted when time averaging the spectra. We include measurements of spot characteristics using a two-temperature model, which we find agree strongly with the three-temperature results. Our expanded use of various techniques to study starspots will help us better understand this system and may have applications for interpreting the transmission spectra for exoplanets transiting stars of a wide range of activity levels.

We present new high-spectral-resolution observations (R = λ/Δλ = 7000) of the filamentary nebula surrounding NGC 1275, the central galaxy of the Perseus cluster. These observations have been obtained with SITELLE, an imaging Fourier transform spectrometer installed on the Canada–France–Hawai Telescope with a field of view of , encapsulating the entire filamentary structure of ionized gas despite its large size of 80 kpc × 50 kpc. Here, we present renewed fluxes, velocities, and velocity dispersion maps that show in great detail the kinematics of the optical nebula at [S ii] λ6716, [S ii] λ6731, [N ii] λ6584, Hα (6563 Å), and [N ii] λ6548. These maps reveal the existence of a bright flattened disk-shaped structure in the core extending to r ∼10 kpc and dominated by a chaotic velocity field. This structure is located in the wake of X-ray cavities and characterized by a high mean velocity dispersion of 134 km s−1. The disk-shaped structure is surrounded by an extended array of filaments spread out to r ∼ 50 kpc that are 10 times fainter in flux, remarkably quiescent, and have a uniform mean velocity dispersion of 44 km s−1. This stability is puzzling given that the cluster core exhibits several energetic phenomena. Based on these results, we argue that there are two mechanisms that form multiphase gas in clusters of galaxies: a first triggered in the wake of X-ray cavities leading to more turbulent multiphase gas and a second, distinct mechanism, that is gentle and leads to large-scale multiphase gas spreading throughout the core.

Observations of galaxy cluster mergers provide insights on the particle acceleration and heating mechanisms taking place within the intracluster medium. Mergers form shocks that propagate through the plasma, which result in shock/cold fronts in the X-ray, and radio halos and/or relics in the radio regime. The connection between these tracers and the mechanisms driving non-thermal processes, such as inverse Compton, are not well understood. ZWCL 1856.8 is one of the few known double radio relic systems that originate from nearly head-on collisions observed close to the plane of the sky. For the first time, we study NuSTAR and Chandra observations of this system, which contains both relics within their field of view. The spectro-imaging analyses results of the system suggest weak shock fronts with numbers within 2σ of the radio-derived values, and provide evidence of inverse Compton emission at both relic sites. Our findings have great uncertainties due to the shallow exposure times available. Deeper NuSTAR and Chandra data are crucial for studying the connection of the radio and X-ray emission features and for constraining the thermal versus non-thermal emission contributions in this system. We also present methods and approaches on how to investigate X-ray properties of double relic systems by taking full advantage of the complementary properties of NuSTAR and Chandra missions.

总结:<br /><br />文章研究了星系周围介质中的湍流运动对星系演化的重要作用，利用[O ii]和[O iii]发射得到的二维速度图，测量了四个类星体星云的速度结构函数(VSF)。结果显示，这些星云中的气体呈次音速湍流，表明冷气体与热环境介质有动力学耦合。通过对八个星云进行研究，发现最大的星云位于星系团环境中，显示出明显的潮汐相互作用迹象，表明环境效应在促进星系气态晕及形成中起着重要作用。研究还估算了QSO星云中的湍流加热率，发现其值与星团介质和星际星云中的结果相符，但比使用吸收线技术在小尺度下测量的结果高出约103倍。作者讨论了通过将基于发射的VSF测量推进到小于约10千秒差距的前景。<br /> <div>
Turbulent motions in the circumgalactic medium play a critical role in regulating the evolution of galaxies, yet their detailed characterization remains elusive. Using two-dimensional velocity maps constructed from spatially extended [O ii] and [O iii] emission, Chen et al. measured the velocity structure functions (VSFs) of four quasar nebulae at z ≈ 0.5–1.1. One of these exhibits a spectacular Kolmogorov relation. Here, we carry out an ensemble study using an expanded sample incorporating four new nebulae from three additional quasi-stellar object (QSO) fields. The VSFs measured for all eight nebulae are best explained by subsonic turbulence revealed by the line-emitting gas, which in turn strongly suggests that the cool gas (T ∼ 104 K) is dynamically coupled to the hot ambient medium. Previous work demonstrates that the largest nebulae in our sample reside in group environments with clear signs of tidal interactions, suggesting that environmental effects are vital in seeding and enhancing the turbulence within the gaseous halos, ultimately promoting the formation of the extended nebulae. No discernible differences are observed in the VSF properties between radio-loud and radio-quiet QSO fields. We estimate the turbulent heating rate per unit volume, Qturb, in the QSO nebulae to be ∼10−26–10−22 erg cm−3 s−1 for the cool phase and ∼10−28–10−25 erg cm−3 s−1 for the hot phase. This range aligns with measurements in the intracluster medium and star-forming molecular clouds but is ∼103 times higher than the Qturb observed inside cool gas clumps on scales ≲1 kpc using absorption-line techniques. We discuss the prospect of bridging the gap between emission and absorption studies by pushing the emission-based VSF measurements to below ≈10 kpc.

这项研究利用了IXPE的长时间曝光来测量大麦哲伦星云中类似蟹星云的PSR B0540-69及其脉泽风星云的X射线偏振。对于图像平均数据未检测到有统计显著的偏振，给出了2-8keV能量范围下99%置信度的偏振上限为5.3%。然而，相相分析发现在4-6keV能量范围内，脉泽风星云和脉泽均存在偏振。对于脉泽风星云，偏振度为(24.5 ± 5.3)%，偏振角为(78.1 ± 6.2)°，在4.6σ的显著水平上检测到，在光学波段观测到的偏振角一致。对于单个脉冲窗口，在3.8σ的显著水平上测量到偏振度为(50.0 ± 13.1)%，偏振角为(6.2 ± 7.4)°。同时脉冲星/脉泽风星云分析发现，在脉冲的边缘有两个中超过3σ显著度的偏振度，为(68 ± 20)%和(62 ± 20)%；在2-3σ显著度上的相邻区间有较低的偏振度，暗示了额外的偏振结构。 
<br /><br />总结:PSR B0540-69和其脉泽风星云在X射线偏振测量中表现出复杂的特征，图像平均数据未检测到统计显著的偏振，但相相分析发现了偏振的存在，表明了该天体的X射线偏振具有丰富的结构和特性。 <div>
We report on X-ray polarization measurements of the extragalactic Crab-like PSR B0540-69 and its Pulsar Wind Nebula (PWN) in the Large Magellanic Cloud, using a ∼850 ks Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) exposure. The PWN is unresolved by IXPE. No statistically significant polarization is detected for the image-averaged data, giving a 99% confidence polarization upper limit (MDP99) of 5.3% in the 2–8 keV energy range. However, a phase-resolved analysis detects polarization for both the nebula and pulsar in the 4–6 keV energy range. For the PWN defined as the off-pulse phases, the polarization degree (PD) of (24.5 ± 5.3)% and polarization angle (PA) of (78.1 ± 6.2)° is detected at 4.6σ significance level, consistent with the PA observed in the optical band. In a single on-pulse window, a hint of polarization is measured at 3.8σ with PD of (50.0 ± 13.1)% and PA of (6.2 ± 7.4)°. A “simultaneous” PSR/PWN analysis finds two bins at the edges of the pulse exceeding 3σ PD significance, with PD of (68 ± 20)% and (62 ± 20)%; intervening bins at 2–3σ significance have lower PD, hinting at additional polarization structure.

通过Keck Cosmic Web Imager对14个位于z ≈ 2的damped Lyα吸收体周围的领域进行了Lyα积分场谱学研究。9个DLAs具有较高的金属丰度([M/H] > − 0.3)，其中4个在影响参数≲30 kpc处有CO发射星系。研究结果显示，这些高金属度DLA相关的H i选择星系可能存在较低的Lyα逃逸分数，证明了使用Lyα、CO、Hα和[C ii] 158μm发射来鉴定z ≈ 2 DLAs相关星系的必要性。除了与QSO B0551-366有关的场景外，在其余八个高金属度DLA领域中没有检测到显著的Lyα发射。综上所述，研究结果表明对于鉴定z ≈ 2 DLAs相关星系，需要综合多种方法。例如Lyα、CO、Hα和[C ii] 158μm发射。 <br /><br />总结: <br />DLAs对应的高金属度星系可能具有较低的Lyα逃逸分数。需要使用多种方法来识别z ≈ 2 DLAs相关的星系。 <div>
We present Keck Cosmic Web Imager Lyα integral field spectroscopy of the fields surrounding 14 damped Lyα absorbers (DLAs) at z ≈ 2. Of these 14 DLAs, nine have high metallicities ([M/H] > − 0.3), and four of those nine feature a CO-emitting galaxy at an impact parameter ≲30 kpc. Our search reaches median Lyα line flux sensitivities of ∼2 × 10−17 erg s−1 cm−2 over apertures of ∼6 kpc and out to impact parameters of ∼50 kpc. We recover the Lyα flux of three known Lyα-emitting H i-selected galaxies in our sample. In addition, we find two Lyα emitters at impact parameters of ≈50–70 kpc from the high-metallicity DLA at z ≈ 1.96 toward QSO B0551-366. This field also contains a massive CO-emitting galaxy at an impact parameter of ≈15 kpc. Apart from the field with QSO B0551-366, we do not detect significant Lyα emission in any of the remaining eight high-metallicity DLA fields. Considering the depth of our observations and our ability to recover previously known Lyα emitters, we conclude that H i-selected galaxies associated with high-metallicity DLAs at z ≈ 2 are dusty and therefore might feature low Lyα escape fractions. Our results indicate that complementary approaches—using Lyα, CO, Hα, and [C ii] 158 μm emission—are necessary to identify the wide range of galaxy types associated with z ≈ 2 DLAs.

<br /><br />
这篇文章主要介绍了Be星通过快速旋转和非径向脉动来建立分离盘的机制，以及这些盘中特征性的谱线发射的形成。文章指出，很多Be星有快速旋转的特性是由于与另一颗恒星的质量和角动量转移所导致的。通过对37颗Be星进行了光学/近红外干涉观测，并成功构建了六颗Be星与其伴星的三维轨道。此外，文章还指出了一些Be星并未发现低质量的伴星，同时也讨论了一些X射线原型星的可能伴星类型。 <div>
Rapid rotation and nonradial pulsations enable Be stars to build decretion disks, where the characteristic line emission forms. A major but unconstrained fraction of Be stars owe their rapid rotation to mass and angular momentum transfer in a binary. The faint, stripped companions can be helium-burning subdwarf OB-type stars (sdOBs), white dwarfs (WDs), or neutron stars. We present optical/near-infrared Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) interferometry of 37 Be stars selected for spectroscopic indications of low-mass companions. From multiepoch H- and/or K-band interferometry plus radial velocities and parallaxes collected elsewhere, we constructed 3D orbits and derived flux ratios and absolute dynamical masses of both components for six objects, quadrupling the number of anchor points for evolutionary models. In addition, a new wider companion was identified for the known Be + sdO binary 59 Cyg, while auxiliary Very Large Telescope Interferometer/GRAVITY spectrointerferometry confirmed circumstellar matter around the sdO companion to HR 2142. On the other hand, we failed to detect any companion to the six Be stars with γ Cas–like X-ray emission, with sdOB and main-sequence companions of the expected spectroscopic mass being ruled out for the X-ray-prototypical stars γ Cas and π Aqr, leaving elusive WDs as the most likely companions, as well as a likely explanation of the X-rays. No low-mass main-sequence close companions were identified for the other stars.

Transient low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are discovered largely by X-ray and gamma-ray all-sky monitors. The X-ray outburst is also accompanied by an optical brightening, which empirically can precede the detection of X-rays. Newly sensitive optical synoptic surveys may offer a complementary pathway for discovery and potential for insight into the initial onset and propagation of the thermal instability that leads to the ionization of the accretion disk. We use the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) alert stream to perform a comprehensive search at optical wavelengths for previously undiscovered outbursting LMXBs. Our pipeline first crossmatches the positions of the alerts to cataloged X-ray sources, and then analyzes the 30 day lightcurve of matched alerts by thresholding on differences with an 8 day exponentially weighted moving average. In addition to a 19 month long live search, we ran our pipeline over 4 yr of ZTF archival data, recovering four known LMXBs. We also independently detected an outburst of MAXI J1957+032 in the live search and found the first outburst of Swift J1943.4+0228, an unclassified X-ray transient, in 10 yr. Using Monte Carlo simulations of the Galactic LMXB population, we estimate that 29% of outbursting LMXBs are detectable by ZTF and that 4.4% of LMXBs would be present in the crossmatched X-ray catalogs, giving an estimated Galactic population of . We estimate that our current pipeline can detect 1.3% of all outbursting LMXBs, including those previously unknown, but that Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time will be able to detect 43% of outbursting LMXBs.

<div> 核心坍缩超新星 (CCSN) 模拟，三维，产生，核合成，多维效应

核心坍缩超新星 (CCSN) 模拟由 Fornax 进行，研究了 18 个三维模拟的喷射条件和理论核合成结果。大部分模拟在弹跳后至少进行了 3 秒的模拟，这使我们能够在长期内跟踪它们的行为。我们发现多维效应为喷射条件引入了许多复杂性。我们观察到随机的电子分数演化，复杂的峰值温度分布和历史，以及在核合成温度范围内所花费的时间的长尾分布。这些都导致了CCSN核合成产量的实质性变化，并且与一维结果有所不同。我们讨论了轻α-核、放射性同位素、重元素以及一些特别感兴趣的同位素的产生。通过比较CCSN之前和CCSN之后的贡献，我们发现在硅到锗之间大约产生的元素的相当一部分通常是在CCSNe中产生的。我们发现，与56Ni相比，44Ti表现出了较长的产生时间尺度，这可能解释了其在超新星遗迹如 Cas A 和 SN1987A中不同的分布和比先前预测的更高的丰度。我们还讨论了喷射元素的形态。这项研究凸显了三维CCSN模拟中喷射条件和核合成结果的高度多样性，并强调了需要进行额外的长期（约10秒）三维模拟以适当解决这些复杂性。<br /><br />总结: 本研究通过核心坍缩超新星模拟发现了多维效应引入的复杂性，包括随机的电子分数演化、复杂的峰值温度分布和历史，以及多维效应对核合成结果的实质性影响。研究还强调了进行更多长期的三维模拟以解决这些复杂性的必要性。 <div>
We study in detail the ejecta conditions and theoretical nucleosynthetic results for 18 three-dimensional core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations done by Fornax. Most of the simulations are carried out to at least 3 s after bounce, which allows us to follow their longer-term behaviors. We find that multidimensional effects introduce many complexities into the ejecta conditions. We see a stochastic electron fraction evolution, complex peak temperature distributions and histories, and long-tail distributions of the time spent within nucleosynthetic temperature ranges. These all lead to substantial variation in CCSN nucleosynthetic yields and differences from 1D results. We discuss the production of lighter α-nuclei, radioactive isotopes, heavier elements, and a few isotopes of special interest. Comparing pre-CCSN and CCSN contributions, we find that a significant fraction of elements between roughly Si and Ge are generally produced in CCSNe. We find that 44Ti exhibits an extended production timescale as compared to 56Ni, which may explain its different distribution and higher than previously predicted abundances in supernova remnants such as Cas A and SN1987A. We also discuss the morphology of the ejected elements. This study highlights the high-level diversity of ejecta conditions and nucleosynthetic results in 3D CCSN simulations and emphasizes the need for additional long-term (∼10 s) 3D simulations to properly address such complexities.

<div> 关键词: gas disk, binary system, eccentricity, instability, gravitational waves
总结: 
本研究发现围绕轨道二元系统的气体盘（所谓的微盘）可能会出现共振不稳定性，导致微盘变得极端偏心。通过数值模拟发现，微盘之间的定期碰撞在一定程度上导致并注入了偏心率。当使用等温状态方程时，微盘的偏心率会受到抑制。然而，即使在这种情况下，不稳定性仍然存在。此外，当引力软化程度较大时，微盘的偏心率也会受到抑制。研究指出，这种抑制可能是广泛采用的数值近似的一种人为因素。未来需要进行三维研究以评估偏心微盘是否可以在真实的天体物理环境中发生。如果是这样，这可能对区分活跃星系核中准周期振荡的双星和单黑洞情景的电磁标记具有重要意义。此外，可能有助于利用脉冲星定时阵列有针对性地搜索低频引力波来源于超大质量黑洞双星的情况。 <div>
We show that gas disks around the components of an orbiting binary system (so-called minidisks) may be susceptible to a resonant instability that causes the minidisks to become significantly eccentric. Eccentricity is injected by, and also induces, regular impacts between the minidisks at roughly the orbital period of the binary. Such eccentric minidisks are seen in vertically integrated, two-dimensional simulations of a circular, equal-mass binary accreting from a circumbinary gas disk with a Γ-law equation of state. Minidisk eccentricity is suppressed by the use of an isothermal equation of state. However, the instability still operates and can be revealed in a minimal disk-binary simulation by removing the circumbinary disk and feeding the minidisks from the component positions. Minidisk eccentricity is also suppressed when the gravitational softening length is large (≳4% of the binary semimajor axis), suggesting that its absence could be an artifact of widely adopted numerical approximations; a follow-up study in three dimensions with well-resolved, geometrically thin minidisks (aspect ratios ≲0.02) may be needed to assess whether eccentric minidisks can occur in real astrophysical environments. If they can, the electromagnetic signature may be important for discriminating between binary and single black hole scenarios for quasiperiodic oscillations in active galactic nuclei; in turn, this might aid in targeted searches with pulsar timing arrays for individual supermassive black hole binary sources of low-frequency gravitational waves.

这篇文章总结了首尔国立大学AGN监测项目（SAMP）开展的长期混响映射研究的主要结果。他们在2015年至2021年期间对32个明亮的活动星系核（AGN）进行了高质量数据的收集，并获得了Hβ发射和连续谱变化之间的时间延迟测量。研究还发现，从文献测量结果中得出的Hβ宽线区大小-亮度关系的斜率比先前报道的要平缓。此外，他们的测量时间滞后大多数短于预期，这意味着基于先前校准的单时黑洞质量估计器可能存在较大的系统误差。 <div>
We present the main results from a long-term reverberation mapping campaign carried out for the Seoul National University AGN Monitoring Project (SAMP). High-quality data were obtained during 2015–2021 for 32 luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs; i.e., continuum luminosity in the range of 1044–46 erg s−1) at a regular cadence, of 20–30 days for spectroscopy and 3–5 days for photometry. We obtain time lag measurements between the variability in the Hβ emission and the continuum for 32 AGNs; 25 of those have the best lag measurements based on our quality assessment, examining correlation strength and the posterior lag distribution. Our study significantly increases the current sample of reverberation-mapped AGNs, particularly at the moderate-to-high-luminosity end. Combining our results with literature measurements, we derive an Hβ broadline region size–luminosity relation with a shallower slope than reported in the literature. For a given luminosity, most of our measured lags are shorter than the expectations, implying that single-epoch black hole mass estimators based on previous calibrations could suffer large systematic uncertainties.

Molecular abundances in protoplanetary disks are highly sensitive to the local physical conditions, including gas temperature, gas density, radiation field, and dust properties. Often multiple factors are intertwined, impacting the abundances of both simple and complex species. We present a new approach to understanding these chemical and physical interdependencies using machine learning. Specifically, we explore the case of CO modeled under the conditions of a generic disk and build an explanatory regression model to study the dependence of CO spatial density on the gas density, gas temperature, cosmic-ray ionization rate, X-ray ionization rate, and UV flux. Our findings indicate that combinations of parameters play a surprisingly powerful role in regulating CO abundance compared to any singular physical parameter. Moreover, in general we find the conditions in the disk are destructive toward CO. CO depletion is further enhanced in an increased cosmic-ray environment and in disks with higher initial C/O ratios. These dependencies uncovered by our new approach are consistent with previous studies, which are more modeling intensive and computationally expensive. Our work thus shows that machine learning can be a powerful tool not only for creating efficient predictive models, but also for enabling a deeper understanding of complex chemical processes.

总结:
本研究提供了地球磁尾磁场中对小振幅压缩性磁流体动力学湍流级联有重要影响的碰撞阻尼(CD)调制的首次观测证据。研究使用了四个Cluster航天器，并基于改进的压缩性磁流体动力学分解算法，将湍流分解为三个本征模式：不可压阿尔文模式和可压缩的慢速和快速（磁音速）模式。观察结果表明，碰撞阻尼增强了可压缩磁流体动力学模式的各向异性，因为碰撞阻尼对波的传播角度有很强的依赖性。快速模式受到更显著的碰撞阻尼调制，具有一个微弱的、与尺度无关的各向异性。随着波数增加，快速模式的各向异性增强。因此，快速模式在可压缩模式的总能量中的比例随着垂直波数（相对于背景磁场）或波传播角度的增加而减少。我们的发现揭示了碰撞阻尼对湍流级联的形成方式以及其在空间环境中各向异性的影响。 <div>
Plasma turbulence is a ubiquitous dynamical process that transfers energy across many spatial and temporal scales and affects energetic particle transport. Recent advances in the understanding of compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence demonstrate the important role of damping in shaping energy distributions on small scales, yet its observational evidence is still lacking. This study provides the first observational evidence of substantial collisionless damping (CD) modulation on the small-amplitude compressible MHD turbulence cascade in Earth’s magnetosheath using four Cluster spacecraft. Based on an improved compressible MHD decomposition algorithm, turbulence is decomposed into three eigenmodes: incompressible Alfvén modes and compressible slow and fast (magnetosonic) modes. Our observations demonstrate that CD enhances the anisotropy of compressible MHD modes because CD has a strong dependence on wave propagation angle. The wavenumber distributions of slow modes are mainly stretched perpendicular to the background magnetic field (B0) and weakly modulated by CD. In contrast, fast modes are subjected to a more significant CD modulation. Fast modes exhibit a weak, scale-independent anisotropy above the CD truncation scale. Below the CD truncation scale, the anisotropy of fast modes enhances as wavenumbers increase. As a result, fast-mode fractions in the total energy of compressible modes decrease with the increase of perpendicular wavenumber (to B0) or wave propagation angle. Our findings reveal how the turbulence cascade is shaped by CD and its consequences for anisotropies in the space environment.

<div> 星系、星系演化、星体形态、星体积效率、星体形态对星体形成效率的影响
<br />
星体形成效率对星体的质量、星体形态和星体形成活动水平有影响。ACA EDGE调查发现，星体形成效率随着星体形成活动水平的降低而系统性减小。研究还发现，处于“绿谷”状态的星系的分子-恒星质量比在核心区域比主序星系更低。此外，研究还指出，在“绿谷”状态的星系中，随着半径增加，分子-恒星质量比和特定星体形成率均呈系统性增加。这些发现暗示了在星系在演化到“绿谷”状态时，星体形成效率的降低是星体形成抑制的重要因素之一。总结：<br /><br />星体形成效率随着星体形成活动水平的降低而系统性减小。处于“绿谷”状态的星系的分子-恒星质量比在核心区域比主序星系更低。在“绿谷”状态的星系中，随着半径增加，分子-恒星质量比和特定星体形成率均呈系统性增加。 <div>
We present a 12CO(J = 2−1) survey of 60 local galaxies using data from the Atacama Compact Array as part of the Extragalactic Database for Galaxy Evolution: the ACA EDGE survey. These galaxies all have integral field spectroscopy from the CALIFA survey. Compared to other local galaxy surveys, ACA EDGE is designed to mitigate selection effects based on CO brightness and morphological type. Of the 60 galaxies in ACA EDGE, 36 are on the star formation main sequence, 13 are on the red sequence, and 11 lie in the “green valley” transition between these sequences. We test how star formation quenching processes affect the star formation rate (SFR) per unit molecular gas mass, SFEmol = SFR/Mmol, and related quantities in galaxies with stellar masses 10 ≤ log[M⋆/M⊙] ≤ 11.5 covering the full range of morphological types. We observe a systematic decrease of the molecular-to-stellar mass fraction ( ) with a decreasing level of star formation activity, with green valley galaxies also having lower SFEmol than galaxies on the main sequence. On average, we find that the spatially resolved SFEmol within the bulge region of green valley galaxies is lower than in the bulges of main-sequence galaxies if we adopt a constant CO-to-H2 conversion factor, αCO. While efficiencies in main-sequence galaxies remain almost constant with galactocentric radius, in green valley galaxies, we note a systematic increase of SFEmol, , and specific SFR with increasing radius. As shown in previous studies, our results suggest that although gas depletion (or removal) seems to be the most important driver of the star formation quenching in galaxies transiting through the green valley, a reduction in star formation efficiency is also required during this stage.

<div> 关键词: 高能辐射，云凝结核，矿物颗粒，聚集，带电状态

总结: 
本研究旨在探索高能辐射对矿物云颗粒聚集和带电状态的影响。实验结果表明，在高湿度环境下，gamma辐射显著增加颗粒的负电荷状态，同时抑制颗粒的聚集形成。而在低湿度环境下，gamma辐射对颗粒的带电状态也有显著影响，但对聚集形成的抑制效果不及在高湿度环境下。因此，高能辐射可能有利于形成大量的小颗粒而非少量的大颗粒。这些发现对于理解行星大气中的云颗粒具有重要意义，特别是考虑到宿主恒星的辐射环境不同，这些研究有助于更好地理解外行星大气的特性。<br /><br /> <div>
It is known from Earth that ionizing high-energy radiation can lead to ion-induced nucleation of cloud condensation nuclei in the atmosphere. Since the amount of high-energy radiation can vary greatly based on the radiative environment of a host star, understanding the effect of high-energy radiation on cloud particles is critical to understand exoplanet atmospheres. This study aims to explore how high-energy radiation affects the aggregation and charging of mineral cloud particles. We present experiments conducted in an atmosphere chamber on mineral SiO2 particles with diameters of 50 nm. The particles were exposed to gamma radiation in either low-humidity (RH ≈ 20%) or high-humidity (RH > 50%) environments. The aggregation and charging state of the particles were studied with a scanning mobility particle sizer. We find that the single SiO2 particles (N1) cluster to form larger aggregates (N2–N4), and that this aggregation is inhibited by gamma radiation. We find that gamma radiation shifts the charging of the particles to become more negative by increasing the charging state of negatively charged particles. Through an independent t-test, we find that this increase is statistically significant within a 5% significance level for all aggregates in the high-humidity environment and all except the N1 particles in the low-humidity environment. For the positively charged particles, the changes in charging state are not within the 5% significance level. We suggest that the overall effect of gamma radiation could favor the formation of a high number of small particles over a lower number of larger particles.

<div> 关键词: 太阳耀斑, 磁场, Lorentz力, 爆发性, 局限性

总结:
太阳耀斑会在光球层的磁场上留下印记，研究旨在通过垂直Lorentz力的变化来区分爆发性和局限性太阳耀斑。研究选取了26个爆发性和11个局限性主要太阳耀斑（强度超过GOES M5级）并分析了这些耀斑区域的磁场。结果显示，在耀斑极性反转线周围区域，水平磁场迅速增加，伴随着相同区域中下行Lorentz力的显著变化。所有局限性事件表现出的Lorentz力变化总量都小于1.8×1022dyn，这一阈值在有效区分爆发性和局限性太阳耀斑中起重要作用。此外，分析结果表明，总Lorentz力的变化还取决于太阳冠层中的重连接高度。这些结果对于理解与耀斑相关的向上脉冲传输以及相关的日冕物质抛射具有重要意义。 <div>
Solar flares are known to leave imprints on the magnetic field in the photosphere, often manifested as an abrupt and permanent change in the downward-directed Lorentz force in localized areas inside the active region. Our study aims to differentiate eruptive and confined solar flares based on the variations in vertical Lorentz force. We select 26 eruptive and 11 confined major solar flares (stronger than the GOES M5 class) observed during 2011–2017. We analyze these flaring regions using SHARP vector magnetograms obtained from NASA’s Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager. We also compare data corresponding to two synthetic flares from a δ-sunspot simulation reported by Chatterjee et al. We estimate the change in the horizontal magnetic field and the total Lorentz force integrated over an area around the polarity inversion line (PIL) that encompasses the location of the flare. Our results indicate a rapid increase in the horizontal magnetic field along the flaring PIL, accompanied by a significant change in the downward-directed Lorentz force in the same vicinity. Notably, we find that all the confined events under study exhibit a total change in Lorentz force of <1.8 × 1022 dyn. This threshold plays an important role in effectively distinguishing eruptive and confined flares. Further, our analysis suggests that the change in total Lorentz force also depends on the reconnection height in the solar corona at the associated flare onset. The results provide significant implications for understanding the flare-related upward impulse transmission for the associated coronal mass ejection.

The analysis of gamma-ray burst (GRB) spectra often relies on empirical models lacking a distinct physical explanation. Previous attempts to couple physical models with observed data focus on individual burst studies, fitting models to segmented spectra with independent physical parameters. However, these approaches typically neglect to explain the time evolution of observed spectra. In this study, we propose a novel approach by incorporating the synchrotron radiation model to provide a self-consistent explanation for a selection of single-pulse GRBs. Our study comprehensively tests the synchrotron model under a unified physical condition, such as a single injection event of electrons. By tracing the evolution of cooling electrons in a decaying magnetic field, our model predicts time-dependent observed spectra that align well with the data. Using a single set of physical parameters, our model successfully fits all time-resolved spectra within each burst. Our model suggests that the rising phase of the GRB light curve results from the increasing number of radiating electrons, while the declining phase is attributed to the curvature effect, electron cooling, and the decaying magnetic field. Our model provides a straightforward interpretation of the peak energy’s evolution, linked to the decline of the magnetic field and electron cooling due to the expansion of the GRB emission region. Our findings strongly support the notion that spectral and temporal evolution in GRB pulses originates from the expansion of the GRB emission region, with an initial radius of approximately 1015 cm, and synchrotron radiation as the underlying emission mechanism.

总结:
通过宇宙学模拟TNG50对类似银河系的星系进行研究发现，银河系类似的恒星盘形成时间和金属丰度存在较大的离散性，约10%的类似银河系的星系在早期形成恒星盘，类似银河系的直接模拟星系大部分质量在100亿年前即已形成，且不受破坏性合并的影响。在早期形成恒星盘的星系中，星盘更倾向于受到旋转支持，且金属丰度较高。相比之下，大多数类似银河系的星系要么是由已经富集的物质形成恒星盘，要么是经历了较晚的破坏性合并导致恒星盘形成较晚并金属丰度较高。 <div>
Recent results from spectroscopic and astrometric surveys of nearby stars suggest that the stellar disk of our Milky Way (MW) was formed quite early, within the first few billion years of its evolution. Chemokinematic signatures of disk formation in cosmological zoom-in simulations appear to be in tension with these data, implying that MW-like disk formation is delayed in simulations. We investigate the formation of galactic disks using a representative sample of MW-like galaxies from the cosmological volume simulation TNG50. We find that on average MW-mass disks indeed form later than the local data suggest. However, their formation time and metallicity exhibit a substantial scatter, such that ∼10% of MW-mass galaxies form disks early, similar to the MW. Thus, although the MW is unusual, it is consistent with the overall population of MW-mass disk galaxies. The direct MW analogs assemble most of their mass early, ≳10 Gyr ago, and are not affected by destructive mergers after that. In addition, these galaxies form their disks during the early enrichment stage when the interstellar medium metallicity increases rapidly, with only ∼25% of early-forming disks being as metal-poor as the MW was at the onset of disk formation, [Fe/H] ≈ −1.0. In contrast, most MW-mass galaxies either form disks from already enriched material or experience late destructive mergers that reset the signatures of galactic disk formation to later times and higher metallicities. Finally, we also show that earlier disk formation leads to more dominant rotationally supported stellar disks at redshift zero.

As stars evolve to higher luminosities during first ascension of the giant branch, previously frozen terrestrial worlds may thaw and host liquid water on their surfaces. Eventually these outer worlds again become uninhabitable due to receiving too much incident light and their water inventory evaporating. Solar-mass stars experience a sudden decrease in luminosity entering the horizontal branch, which could result in a secondary habitable phase for their outer worlds. The outer worlds’ time with habitable surface climates is key in evaluating the possibility of extraterrestrial life arising. The times inside the habitable zone (TIHZ) are calculated for outer worlds orbiting between 5 and 45 au around a Sun-like star. By comparing the TIHZ to time estimates for life to arise on Earth, we evaluate whether such outer worlds are promising candidates in the search for extraterrestrial life. We use two different solar evolution models (PARSEC and Dartmouth) and both optimistic and conservative habitable zone (HZ) definitions. Multiple habitable phases are found for each outer world. Outer worlds with orbits as large as Saturn are found to have a secondary habitable phase which exceeds the first in duration. Generally, the time inside the HZ is found to decrease almost monotonically with orbiting distance. Water loss is calculated after the first habitable phase to determine whether a secondary habitable phase is possible. For all orbiting distances the water loss is insufficient to deplete a water inventory equivalent to that of many moons in the outer solar system.

更新估计卡西opeia A超新星遗迹中中子星(NS)速度的研究。研究利用20年的Chandra观测数据，采用两种方法进行估计：一种是记录数十次Chandra观测中NS的位置，包括数据点的天文学不确定性估计，但不纠正观测的天文测量；另一种是纠正具有足够数量点源并确定了盖亚对应源的13次Chandra观测的天文测量。对于方法#1，观测到一个位于北方177° ± 22°的太阳系速度为275 ± 121 km s−1；对于方法#2，观测到一个位于北方158° ± 12°的太阳系速度为436 ± 89 km s−1。考虑到银河旋转和太阳的特殊运动，这些估计减少到分别为256 km s−1 and 167°和433 km s−1和151°。我们的估计排除了速度≳600 km s−1，与卡西opeia A的爆炸中心估计的速度∼350 km s−1和先前10年基线固有运动测量的570 ± 260 km s−1相匹配，但我们使用了更长时间跨度上的额外数据，导致了2-3倍的减小不确定性。我们的估计更好地匹配包括NS踢动机制的卡西opeia A的模拟。 <br /><br />总结: 通过Chandra观测数据，对卡西opeia A超新星遗迹中中子星(NS)速度进行了研究。使用两种方法得出的估计速度与先前的测量相匹配，但由于使用了更长时间跨度的额外数据，导致了更小的不确定性。新的估计排除了某些速度范围，并与包括NS踢动机制的模拟更好地匹配。 <div>
In this paper, we present updated estimates of the velocity of the neutron star (NS) in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A using over two decades of Chandra observations. We use two methods: (1) recording the NS positions from dozens of Chandra observations, including the astrometric uncertainty estimates on the data points, but not correcting the astrometry of the observations; and (2) correcting the astrometry of the 13 Chandra observations that have a sufficient number of point sources with identified Gaia counterparts. For method #1, we observe a heliocentric velocity of 275 ± 121 km s−1, with an angle of 177° ± 22° east of north. For method #2, we observe a heliocentric velocity of 436 ± 89 km s−1 at an angle of 158° ± 12°. Correcting for galactic rotation and the Sun’s peculiar motion decreases these estimates to 256 km s−1 at 167° and 433 km s−1 at 151°, respectively. Both of our estimates match with the explosion-center-estimated velocity of ∼350 km s−1 and the previous 10 yr baseline proper-motion measurement of 570 ± 260 km s−1, but our use of additional data over a longer baseline has led to a smaller uncertainty by a factor of 2–3. Our estimates rule out velocities ≳600 km s−1 and better match with simulations of Cassiopeia A that include NS kick mechanisms.

<br /><br />总结:
研究分析了围绕银河系中心超大质量黑洞的S星团的轨道分布。发现了围绕近地点距离rp与轨道离心率e⋆之间的紧密依存关系，这不能简单地通过半长轴和离心率的随机分布来解释。没有发现在大e⋆和大rp区域或小e⋆和小rp区域有任何恒星。虽然样本仍很小，但G云显示了非常相似的分布。确定了确定S星的轨道参数的可能性。具有大e⋆和大rp的恒星的可能性非常小。S星可能存在于该区域。但是，要确定它们的轨道参数，需要在更长的时间段内进行观测。另一方面，如果存在小rp和小e⋆的恒星，则它们的轨道参数应该已经被确定。因此，这一区域的无星表明不存在具有这些轨道特征的S星，为它们的形成提供了约束。我们将这一由rp和e⋆定义的区域称为回避区。最后，结果表明，如果考虑到在回避区内没有恒星存在以及目前无法确定具有大rp和大e⋆的恒星的轨道参数这一事实，观测到的离心率和近地点距离的频率与对rp和e⋆的随机抽样是一致的。 <div>
The orbital distribution of the S-star cluster surrounding the supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way is analyzed. A tight dependence of the pericenter distance rp on orbital eccentricity e⋆ is found, , which cannot be explained simply by a random distribution of semimajor axis and eccentricities. No stars are found in the region with high e⋆ and large or in the region with low e⋆ and small . Although the sample is still small, the G-clouds show a very similar distribution. The likelihood to determine the orbital parameters of S-stars is determined. P is very small for stars with large e⋆ and large . S-stars might exist in this region. To determine their orbital parameters, one however needs observations over a longer time period. On the other hand, if stars would exist in the region of low and small e⋆, their orbital parameters should by now have been determined. That this region is unpopulated therefore indicates that no S-stars exist with these orbital characteristics, providing constraints for their formation. We call this region, defined by , the zone of avoidance. Finally, it is shown that the observed frequency of eccentricities and pericenter distances is consistent with a random sampling of and e⋆ if one takes into account the fact that no stars exist in the zone of avoidance and that orbital parameters cannot yet be determined for stars with large rp and large e⋆.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Spin period distribution provides important clues to understand the formation of millisecond pulsars (MSPs). To uncover the intrinsic period distribution, we analyze three samples of radio MSPs in the Galactic field and globular clusters. The selection bias due to pulse broadening has been corrected but turns out to be negligible. We find that all the samples can be well described by a Weibull distribution of spin frequencies. Considering MSPs in the Galactic field or globular clusters and in isolation or binary systems, we find no significant difference in the spin distribution among these subpopulations. Based on the current known population of MSPs, we find that submillisecond pulsars are unlikely to be discovered by the Square Kilometre Array, although up to ∼10 discoveries of pulsars that spin faster than the current record holder of P = 1.4 ms are expected.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We simulate a black hole accretion disk system with full-transport general relativistic neutrino radiation magnetohydrodynamics for 1.2 s. This system is likely to form after the merger of two compact objects and is thought to be a robust site of r-process nucleosynthesis. We consider the case of a black hole accretion disk arising from the merger of two neutron stars. Our simulation time coincides with the nucleosynthesis timescale of the r-process (∼1 s). Because these simulations are time-consuming, it is common practice to run for a “short” duration of approximately 0.1–0.3 s. We analyze the nucleosynthetic outflow from this system and compare the results of stopping at 0.12 and 1.2 s. We find that the addition of mass ejected in the longer simulation as well as more favorable thermodynamic conditions from emergent viscous ejecta greatly impacts the nucleosynthetic outcome. We quantify the error in nucleosynthetic outcomes between short and long cuts.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The tidal disruption of a star around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) offers a unique opportunity to study accretion onto an SMBH on a human timescale. We present results from our 1000+ days monitoring campaign of AT 2019avd, a nuclear transient with tidal-disruption-event-like properties, with NICER, Swift, and Chandra. Our primary finding is that approximately 225 days following the peak of the X-ray emission, there is a rapid drop in luminosity exceeding 2 orders of magnitude. This X-ray dropoff is accompanied by X-ray spectral hardening, followed by a plateau phase of 740 days. During this phase, the spectral index decreases from 6.2 ± 1.1 to 2.3 ± 0.4, while the disk temperature remains constant. Additionally, we detect pronounced X-ray variability, with an average fractional rms amplitude of 47%, manifesting over timescales of a few dozen minutes. We propose that this phenomenon may be attributed to intervening clumpy outflows. The overall properties of AT 2019avd suggest that the accretion disk evolves from a super-Eddington to a sub-Eddington luminosity state, possibly associated with a compact jet. This evolution follows a pattern in the hardness–intensity diagram similar to that observed in stellar-mass BHs, supporting the mass invariance of accretion–ejection processes around BHs.

<title>Relativistic Effects on Circumbinary Disk Evolution: Breaking the Polar Alignment around Eccentric Black Hole Binary Systems</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the effects of general relativity (GR) on the evolution and alignment of circumbinary disks around binaries on all scales. We implement relativistic apsidal precession of the binary into the hydrodynamics code phantom. We find that the effects of GR can suppress the stable polar alignment of a circumbinary disk, depending on how the relativistic binary apsidal precession timescale compares to the disk nodal precession timescale. Studies of circumbinary disk evolution typically ignore the effects of GR, which is an appropriate simplification for low-mass or widely separated binary systems. In this case, polar alignment occurs, provided that the disks initial misalignment is sufficiently large. However, systems with a very short relativistic precession timescale cannot polar align and instead move toward coplanar alignment. In the intermediate regime where the timescales are similar, the outcome depends upon the properties of the disk. Polar alignment is more likely in the wavelike disk regime (where the disk viscosity parameter is less than the aspect ratio, α < H/r), since the disk is in good radial communication. In the viscous disk regime, disk breaking is more likely. Multiple rings can destructively interact with one another, resulting in short disk lifetimes and the disk moving toward coplanar alignment. Around main-sequence star or stellar mass black hole binaries, polar alignment may be suppressed far from the binary, but in general, the inner parts of the disk can align to polar. Polar alignment may be completely suppressed for disks around supermassive black holes for close binary separations.

<title>Magnetic Relaxation Seen in a Rapidly Evolving Light Bridge in a Sunspot</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report a magnetic relaxation process inside a sunspot associated with the evolution of a transient light bridge (LB). From high-resolution imaging and spectro-polarimetric data taken by the 1.6 m Goode Solar Telescope installed at Big Bear Solar Observatory, we observe the evolutionary process of a rapidly evolving LB. The LB is formed as a result of the strong intrusion of filamentary structures with relatively horizontal fields into the vertical umbral field region. A strong current density is detected along a localized region where the magnetic field topology changes rapidly in the sunspot, especially in the boundary region between the LB and the umbra, and bright jets are observed intermittently and repeatedly in the chromosphere along this region through magnetic reconnection. In the second half of our observation, the horizontal component of the magnetic field diminishes within the LB, and the typical convection structure within the sunspot, which manifests itself as umbral dots, is restored. Our findings provide a comprehensive perspective not only on the evolution of an LB itself but also on its impacts in the neighboring regions, including the chromospheric activity and the change of magnetic energy of a sunspot.

We present deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the nearby Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2011fe obtained 11.5 yr after explosion. No emission is detected at the SN location to a 1σ (3σ) limit of F555W > 30.2 (29.0) mag, or equivalently MV > 1.2 (−0.1) mag, neglecting the distance uncertainty to M101. We constrain the presence of donor stars impacted by the SN ejecta with the strictest limits thus far on compact (i.e., ) companions. H-rich zero-age main-sequence companions with masses ≥2 M⊙ are excluded, a significant improvement upon the preexplosion imaging limit of ≈5 M⊙. Main-sequence He stars with masses ≥1.0 M⊙ and subgiant He stars with masses ≤0.8 M⊙ are also disfavored by our late-time imaging. Synthesizing our limits on postimpact donors with previous constraints from preexplosion imaging, early-time radio and X-ray observations, and nebular-phase spectroscopy, essentially all formation channels for SN 2011fe invoking a nondegenerate donor star at the time of explosion are unlikely.
