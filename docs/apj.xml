<div> ram pressure, star formation rates, SFR measurements, GASP survey, dense gas

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了来自GASP调查的五个星系中，受到了风压剥夺气体的后期阶段，对SFR的影响。研究结果显示，在受密集气体主导的区域，UV和Hα示踪物显示类似的SFR值，而在受弥散电离气体主导的区域，SFR(UV)高出0.5 dex。另外，研究还发现了在Hα有发射而UV没有的区域，这些区域显示出类似LINER的发射特征，表明它们的电离过程不是由于恒星形成。最终的结论是，导致SFR测量差异的主要原因是最近在受到DIG主导的区域中星形成历史的变化。 <div>
Star formation rates (SFRs) in galaxies offer a view of various physical processes across them, and are measured using various tracers, such as Hα and ultraviolet (UV). Different physical mechanisms can affect Hα and UV emission, resulting in a discrepancy in the corresponding SFR estimates (ΔSFR). We investigate the effects of ram pressure on the SFR measurements and ΔSFR across five galaxies from the GASP survey caught in the late stages of gas stripping due to ram pressure. We probe spatially resolved ΔSFR at pixel scales of 0.5 kpc, and compare disks to tails and regions dominated by the dense gas to diffuse ionized gas (DIG) regions. The regions dominated by dense gas show similar SFR values for UV and Hα tracers, while the regions dominated by the DIG show up to 0.5 dex higher SFR(UV). There is a large galaxy-by-galaxy variation in ΔSFR, with no difference between the disks and the tails. We discuss the potential causes of variations in ΔSFR between the dense gas and DIG areas. We conclude that the dominant cause of discrepancy are recent variations in star formation histories, where star formation recently dropped in the DIG-dominated regions leading to changes in ΔSFR. The areal coverage of the tracers shows areas with Hα and no UV emission; these areas have LINER-like emission (excess in [O iλ6300]/Hα line ratio), indicating that they are ionized by processes other than star formation.

The gas-phase velocity dispersions in disk galaxies, which trace turbulence in the interstellar medium, are observed to increase with lookback time. However, the mechanisms that set this rise in turbulence are observationally poorly constrained. To address this, we combine kiloparsec-scale Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of CO(3−2) and CO(4−3) with Hubble Space Telescope observations of Hα to characterize the molecular gas and star formation properties of seven local analogs of main-sequence galaxies at z ∼ 1–2, drawn from the DYNAMO sample. Investigating the “molecular gas main sequence” on kiloparsec scales, we find that galaxies in our sample are more gas-rich than local star-forming galaxies at all disk positions. We measure beam-smearing-corrected molecular gas velocity dispersions and relate them to the molecular gas and star formation rate surface densities. Despite being relatively nearby (z ∼ 0.1), DYNAMO galaxies exhibit high velocity dispersions and gas and star formation rate surface densities throughout their disks, when compared to local star-forming samples. Comparing these measurements to predictions from star formation theory, we find very good agreements with the latest feedback-regulated star formation models. However, we find that theories that combine dissipation of gravitational energy from radial gas transport with feedback overestimate the observed molecular gas velocity dispersions.

总结: 
本文描述了“Medium Bands, Mega Science” JWST Cycle 2调查（JWST-GO-4111），展示了这些数据揭示了从当地宇宙到宇宙黎明时代的星系的空间集成和空间分辨特性。MegaScience获得了大约30平方弧秒的深度多波段NIRCam成像，其中包括11个中波段滤光片和两个最短波长的宽带滤光片，F070W和F090W。此外，MegaScience还包括了大约17平方弧秒的NIRISS平行成像。我们公开发布了NIRCam主要和NIRISS并行领域的完全降低的数据和光度目录。我们的研究显示，MegaScience通过光度红移的分散度和灾难性离群值率改善了2-3倍。此外，我们通过展示三个光谱确认的z>6星系的 [O iii]线发射和连续发射的地图，展示了MegaScience所带来的空间解析科学的价值。这些研究结果证明了就连在早期时代，星系的结构和形成历史也是复杂的。 <div>
In this paper, we describe the “Medium Bands, Mega Science” JWST Cycle 2 survey (JWST-GO-4111) and demonstrate the power of these data to reveal both the spatially integrated and spatially resolved properties of galaxies from the local Universe to the era of cosmic dawn. Executed in 2023 November, MegaScience obtained ∼30 arcmin2 of deep multiband NIRCam imaging centered on the z ∼ 0.3 A2744 cluster, including 11 medium-band filters and the two shortest-wavelength broadband filters, F070W and F090W. Together, MegaScience and the UNCOVER Cycle 1 treasury program provide a complete set of deep (∼28–30 magAB) images in all NIRCam medium- and broadband filters. This unique data set allows us to precisely constrain photometric redshifts, map stellar populations and dust attenuation for large samples of distant galaxies, and examine the connection between galaxy structures and formation histories. MegaScience also includes ∼17 arcmin2 of NIRISS parallel imaging in two broadband and four medium-band filters from 0.9 to 4.8 μm, expanding the footprint where robust spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting is possible. We provide example SEDs and multiband cutouts at a variety of redshifts, and use a catalog of JWST spectroscopic redshifts to show that MegaScience improves both the scatter and catastrophic outlier rate of photometric redshifts by factors of 2–3. Additionally, we demonstrate the spatially resolved science enabled by MegaScience by presenting maps of the [O iii] line emission and continuum emission in three spectroscopically confirmed z > 6 galaxies. We show that line emission in reionization-era galaxies can be clumpy, extended, and spatially offset from continuum emission, implying that galaxy assembly histories are complex even at these early epochs. We publicly release fully reduced mosaics and photometric catalogs for both the NIRCam primary and NIRISS parallel fields (jwst-uncover.github.io/megascience).

We have used high-resolution zoom-in simulations of direct collapse to supermassive black hole (SMBH) seeds within dark mater halos in the presence of magnetic fields generated during the collapse, down to 10−5 pc or 2 au. We confirm an efficient amplification of magnetic field during collapse, the formation of a geometrically thick self-gravitating accretion disk inside 0.1 pc, and damping of fragmentation in the disk by the field. This disk differs profoundly from SMBH accretion disks. We find the following: (1) The accretion disk is subject to the magnetorotational instability, which further amplifies the field to near equipartition. No artificial seeding of the disk field has been used. (2) The equipartition toroidal field changes its polarity in the midplane. (3) The nonlinear Parker instability develops, accompanied by the vertical buckling of the field lines, which injects material above the disk, leading to an increase in the disk scale height. (4) With the Coriolis force producing a coherent helicity above the disk, the vertical poloidal field has been generated and amplified. (5) We estimate that the associated outflow will be most probably squashed by accretion. The resulting configuration consists of a magnetized disk with β ≳ 0.1 and its magnetosphere with β ≪ 1, where β = Pth/PB is the ratio of thermal to magnetic energy density. (6) The disk is highly variable, due to feeding by variable accretion flow, and strong vortical motions are present. (7) Finally, the negative gradient of the total vertical stress drives an equatorial outflow sandwiched by an inward accretion flow.

Understanding when and how reionization happened is crucial for studying the early structure formation and the properties of the first galaxies in the Universe. At z > 5.5, the observed intergalactic medium (IGM) optical depth shows a significant scatter, indicating an inhomogeneous reionization process. However, the nature of the inhomogeneous reionization remains debated. A SPectroscopic survey of biased halos In the Reionization Era (ASPIRE) is a JWST Cycle 1 program that has spectroscopically identified >400 [O iii] emitters in 25 quasar fields at z > 6.5. Combined with deep ground-based optical spectroscopy of ASPIRE quasars, the ASPIRE program provides the current largest sample for IGM-galaxy connection studies during cosmic reionization. We present the first results of IGM effective optical depth measurements around [O iii] emitters using 14 ASPIRE quasar fields. We find the IGM transmission is tightly related to reionization era galaxies to the extent that a significant excess of Lyα transmission exists around [O iii] emitters. We measure the stacked IGM effective optical depth of IGM patches associated with [O iii] emitters and find they reach the same IGM effective optical depth at least dz ∼ 0.1 ahead of those IGM patches where no [O iii] emitters are detected, supporting earlier reionization around [O iii] emitters. Our results indicate an enhancement in IGM Lyα transmission around [O iii] emitters at scales beyond 25 h−1 cMpc, consistent with the predicted topology of reionization from fluctuating UV background models.

The binary-driven hypernova (BdHN) model proposes long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate in binaries composed of a carbon–oxygen (CO) star and a neutron star (NS) companion. The CO core collapse generates a newborn NS and a supernova that triggers the GRB by accreting onto the NSs, rapidly transferring mass and angular momentum to them. This article aims to determine the conditions under which a black hole (BH) forms from NS collapse induced by the accretion and the impact on the GRB’s observational properties and taxonomy. We perform three-dimensional, smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of BdHNe using up-to-date NS nuclear equations of state, with and without hyperons, and calculate the structure evolution in full general relativity. We assess the binary parameters leading either NS in the binary to the critical mass for gravitational collapse into a BH and its occurrence time, tcol. We include a nonzero angular momentum of the NSs and find that tcol ranges from a few tens of seconds to hours for decreasing NS initial angular momentum values. BdHNe I are the most compact (about 5 minute orbital period), promptly form a BH, and release ≳1052 erg of energy. They form NS–BH binaries with tens of kiloyears merger timescales by gravitational-wave emission. BdHNe II and III do not form BHs, and release ∼1050–1052 erg and ≲1050 erg of energy, respectively. They form NS–NS binaries with a range of merger timescales larger than for NS–BH binaries. In some compact BdHNe II, either NS can become supramassive, i.e., above the critical mass of a nonrotating NS. Magnetic braking by a 1013 G field can delay BH formation, leading to BH–BH or NS–BH with tens of kiloyears merger timescales.

总结:
射电星系根据形态学可分为两大类：FR-I和FR-II。研究表明，射流动力学结构受到能量注入通量和射流与背景密度对比的影响。通过相对论流体力学模拟，发现了低能量相对论射流在亚千秒差距和千秒差距尺度上的流动结构。模拟结果显示，射流主脊的速度和背景密度梯度对射流诱导流的动力学和结构起主导作用。使用简单的磁场分布和非热电子模型以及相对论束缚效应，制作了模拟射流的合成同步辐射亮度地图，结果与观测相一致。对比了不同背景效应，认为压力约束的丧失可能是FR-I射流不稳定和破裂的关键因素。研究结果证实，温和相对论射流能够解释射电星系的单侧或不对称特征。 <div>
Radio galaxies are classified into two primary categories based on their morphology: center-brightened FR-I and edge-brightened FR-II. It is believed that the jet power and interactions with the ambient medium govern the deceleration and decollimation of the jet-spine flows, which, in turn, influence this dichotomy. Using high-resolution, three-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic simulations, we follow the development of flow structures on sub-kiloparsec to kiloparsec scales in kinetically dominant low-power relativistic jets. We find that the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet spine and the advance speed of the jet head, which depend on the energy injection flux and the jet-to-background density contrast, primarily determine the dynamics and structures of the jet-induced flows. The entrainment of ambient gas and the background density and pressure gradient may also play significant roles. To emulate radio morphology, we produce the synthetic maps of the synchrotron surface brightness for the simulated jets, by employing simple models for magnetic field distribution and nonthermal electron population and considering relativistic beaming effects at different inclination angles. Both the flow structures and radio maps capture the longitudinal and transverse structures of the jet-spine and shear layer, consistent with observations. We also compare different background effects and argue that the loss of pressure confinement beyond the galactic core may be a key factor in the flaring and disruption of FR-I jets. Our results confirm that mildly relativistic jets could explain the one-sidedness or asymmetries with the boosted main jet and deboosted counterjet pairs.

本研究探讨了恒星外壳的声学扰动如何通过非线性波陡增导致弱激波的形成。我们使用了平行欧拉方程在等熵流动情况下有精确黎曼不变量的事实，得出了声学扰动的精确解，并展示了在波峰形成激波之后，可以使用惠特姆逼近来解决激波的动力学问题，使用简单的常微分方程。数值模拟表明我们的解析激波近似在中等马赫数范围内是准确的，其中准确性随绝热指数增加而增加。 <div>
Acoustic perturbations to stellar envelopes can lead to the formation of weak shock waves via nonlinear wave steepening. Close to the stellar surface, the weak shock wave increases in strength and can potentially lead to the expulsion of part of the stellar envelope. While accurate analytic solutions to the fluid equations exist in the limits of low-amplitude waves or strong shocks, connecting these phases generally requires simulations. We address this problem using the fact that the plane-parallel Euler equations, in the presence of a constant gravitational field, admit exact Riemann invariants when the flow is isentropic. We obtain exact solutions for acoustic perturbations and show that after they steepen into shock waves, Whitham’s approximation can be used to solve for the shock’s dynamics in the weak to moderately strong regimes, using a simple ordinary differential equation. Numerical simulations show that our analytic shock approximation is accurate up to moderate (∼few–15) Mach numbers, where the accuracy increases with the adiabatic index.

总结:
该研究利用射电太阳望远镜网络在1989年1月1日至2019年12月17日期间记录的太阳无线电流量数据，通过集合经验模态分解（EEMD）和小波分析的方法，研究了太阳冠层的径向差分旋转的时间演变。结果显示，在30年的观测期间内，在245-8800 MHz的频率范围内，太阳无线电流量的旋转率随频率增加而增加，验证了太阳冠层在近三个太阳周期的长时间尺度上存在径向差分旋转。同时，根据射电发射机制，这些结果在一定程度上可以作为太阳上层大气旋转随高度变化的指标。此外，通过无线电流量旋转周期长度的时间变化，研究发现从低冠层到大约1.3个太阳半径高度范围内，太阳冠层旋转随着太阳活动周期的进展表现出复杂的时间变化，但在过去30年里，冠层旋转速度随着高度增加而逐渐变慢。最后，EEMD方法可以从这些高度随机的无线电发射中提取旋转周期信号，因此可以用来研究更高或更低频率的无线电发射的旋转周期。 <br /><br /> <div>
The daily measurements of the disk-integrated solar radio flux, observed by the Radio Solar Telescope Network, at 245, 410, 610, 1415, 2695, 4995, and 8800 MHz during the time interval of 1989 January 1 to 2019 December 17, are used to investigate the temporal evolution of radial differential rotation of the solar corona using the methods of ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and wavelet analysis. Overall, the results reveal that over the 30 yr period, the rotation rates for the observed solar radio flux within the frequency range of 245–8800 MHz show an increase with frequency. This verifies the existence of the radial differential rotation of the solar corona over long timescales of nearly three solar cycles. Based on the radio emission mechanism, to some extent, the results can also serve as an indicator of how the rotation of the solar upper atmosphere varies with altitude within a specific range. From the temporal variation of rotation cycle lengths of radio flux, the coronal rotation at different altitudes from the low corona to approximately 1.3 R⊙ exhibits complex temporal variations with the progression of the solar cycle. However, in this altitude range, over the past 30 yr from 1989 to 2019, the coronal rotation consistently becomes gradually slower as the altitude increases. Finally, the EEMD method can extract rotation cycle signals from these highly randomized radio emissions, and so it can be used to investigate the rotation periods for the radio emissions at higher or lower frequencies.

Ultralow-frequency (ULF) waves在木星系统中普遍存在，与磁层和电离层中的能量耗散有关。尽管磁层内部存在与行星自转相关的磁盘振荡，但通过Juno探测器在磁层界面层的长时间（>4小时）原位测量，可以直接评估内部等离子体和外部太阳风相互作用导致的界面动态的几十分钟周期性。通过磁场和粒子数据的周期图分析，发现了约18分钟、约40分钟和约70-80分钟的ULF波，这与远程遥感观测中的脉动一致。同时还发现了多谐波ULF现象。原位测量得到的周期性提供了解木星系统中脉动波动/极光发射起源的重要线索。这些结果还有助于进一步了解木星内部等离子体与外部太阳风之间的能量传输和释放。 <br /><br />总结: Ultralow-frequency waves在木星系统中广泛存在，Juno探测器的原位测量揭示了多种周期性，这些发现有助于我们更好地理解木星系统中的能量转移和释放过程。 <div>
Ultralow-frequency (ULF) waves (∼tens of minutes period) are widely identified in the Jovian system and are believed to be associated with energy dissipation in the magnetosphere and ionosphere. Due to the magnetodisk oscillation related to planetary rotation, it is challenging to identify the periodicities inside the magnetosphere, although remote sensing observations of the polar emissions provide clear evidence of the tens of minutes pulsations. In this study, we take advantage of Juno’s in situ measurements in the magnetopause boundary layer for a long duration, i.e., >4 hr, to directly assess the tens of minutes periodicities of the boundary dynamics caused by the interactions between the internal plasma and external solar wind. Through periodogram analysis on the magnetic field and particle data, we find ULF waves with periodicities of ∼18 minutes, ∼40 minutes, and ∼70–80 minutes, which is generally consistent with pulsations in multiple remote sensing observations. A multiple-harmonic ULF phenomenon was also identified in the observations. The periodicities from in situ measurements provide crucial clues in understanding the origin of pulsating wave/auroral emissions in the Jovian system. The results could also further our understanding of energy transfer and release between the internal plasma of Jupiter and external solar wind.

总结:<br /><br />这项研究利用Juno任务在太阳系外巡航阶段的磁场数据，对1-5.5天文单位距离范围内的338个小磁通量绳进行了可视化识别和分析。研究发现这些事件在日心距离上均匀分布，没有明显的趋势。平均来看，小磁通量绳的磁场轮廓对称，并且在观测的日心距离上变化不大。此外，研究还观察到小磁通量绳的持续时间平均呈轻微增加趋势，表明在传播过程中扩展很小。研究确定小磁通量绳的平均磁场与距离的关系最适合用两个分别的幂律来描述，从1到大约2.1天文单位距离有较陡的衰减，而从大约2.1到5.5天文单位距离的衰减较为缓和。研究还发现，在近1天文单位距离，小磁通量绳平均磁场的统计衰减速率略高于恒星际磁场，这表明小磁通量绳可能随时间变得难以与恒星际磁场区分开。在总体小磁通量绳中，仅有约26%出现在距离太阳风带电流片区1天的范围内，这表明大多数小磁通量绳的出现与太阳风带电流片区的关联性非常有限。这些结果对于太阳系外探测到的小磁通量绳的起源提出了问题，鼓励寻找传统发生机制之外的替代方案。 <div>
In this study, we utilize magnetic field data from the Juno mission’s cruise phase to visually identify and analyze 338 interplanetary small flux ropes (SFRs) across a heliocentric distance range of 1–5.5 au. The events are uniformly distributed across heliocentric distances, showing no clear trend. Through superposed epoch analysis, we find that the average SFR magnetic field profiles are symmetric and show little variation across the observed heliocentric distances. Additionally, we observe a slight increasing trend in the mean duration of SFRs, indicating minimal expansion during propagation. Furthermore, we determine that the SFR mean magnetic field dependence on distance is best fit by two separate power laws, exhibiting a steeper decay from 1 to ∼2.1 au and a shallower decay from ∼2.1 to 5.5 au. Near 1 au, the statistical decay rate of the mean magnetic field magnitude of SFRs is slightly higher than that of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), suggesting that SFRs may become indistinguishable from the IMF over time. This finding implies that SFRs detected at greater radial distances are possibly generated in situ as opposed to near the Sun. However, only ∼26% of the total population of SFRs in our catalog occurs within 1 day from the heliospheric current sheet (HCS), indicating a very limited association between the occurrence of the majority of SFRs and the presence of the HCS. These results raise questions about the origin of SFRs detected at larger distances, encouraging further exploration for alternatives to the conventional generation mechanisms.

星系聚类研究了星系的动力学特性与宿主暗物质的关系，通过使用IllustrisTNG和SIMBA星系形成模型的2000个流体动力学模拟，对M* > 10^9M⊙的中心星系和卫星星系应用了神经密度估计（NDE）来估计它们的空间和速度偏移。结果表明，中心星系的空间和速度存在显著偏差，与宿主暗物质的质量、浓度和自旋密切相关。而卫星星系的分布显示出明显的不规则性，可以分为不同的轨道和进入种群。然而，对于θ的依赖性较弱。此外，宇宙参数和原初宇宙中子星和活跃星系核的反馈似乎对这些星系的动力学特性没有明显的影响。这些结果为改善当前的HOD模型提供了关键见解，并且将有助于在小尺度对星系聚类进行更好的建模。

Galaxy clustering contains information on cosmology, galaxy evolution, and the relationship between galaxies and their dark matter hosts. On small scales, the detailed kinematics of galaxies within their host halos determines the galaxy clustering. In this paper, we investigate the dependence of the central and satellite galaxy kinematics on θ, the intrinsic host halo properties (mass, spin, concentration), cosmology (Ωm, σ8), and baryonic feedback from active galactic nuclei and supernovae (AAGN1, AAGN2, ASN1, ASN2). We utilize 2000 hydrodynamic simulations in CAMELS run using IllustrisTNG and SIMBA galaxy formation models. Focusing on central and satellite galaxies with M* > 109M⊙, we apply neural density estimation (NDE) with normalizing flows to estimate their p(Δr ∣ θ) and p(Δv ∣ θ), where Δr and Δv are the magnitudes of the halocentric spatial and velocity offsets. With NDE, we accurately capture the dependence of galaxy kinematics on each component of θ. For central galaxies, we identify significant spatial and velocity biases dependent on halo mass, concentration, and spin. For satellite distributions, we find significant deviations from a Navarro–Frenk–White profile and evidence that they consist of distinct orbiting and infalling populations. However, we find no strong dependence on θ besides a weak dependence on host halo spin. For both central and satellite galaxies, there is no notable dependence on cosmological parameters and baryonic feedback. These results provide key insights for improving the current halo occupation distribution (HOD) models. This work is the first in a series that will reexamine and develop HOD frameworks for improved modeling of galaxy clustering at smaller scales.

<div> 关键词: 太阳高纬度、太阳自转速率、极地斑、太阳年轻

这篇论文描述了一种新的方法，从同时观测多个极地斑的数据中，统计确定高纬度太阳自转速率的方法。作者提取了之前在1997年2月至1998年2月期间获取的在6767Å连续波段的平坦场图像制作的电影中的帧，并用这些帧构建了有利的朝向南极帽高纬度切片的时空图。这些图显示了一系列倾斜的轨迹，其平均斜率表示该纬度的斑点的东西速度。当斜率被测量并作为纬度的函数绘制时，它们显示出相对较小的散射，约为0.01-0.02 km s-1，从一个直线的零速度延伸通过太阳的南极。这意味着速度v(λs)和纬度半径r(λs)以相同的速率趋近于0，因此它们的比率给出了一个几乎恒定的绕太阳南极的日辉自转速率约为8.6°/天。在一些不利的朝向北极帽的测量与南极附近的这些测量一致。 <br /><br />总结：这篇论文描述了一种新的方法，用于统计确定高纬度太阳自转速率，通过观测极地斑来得出结果。作者发现，南极附近的斑点显示出固定的自转速率约为8.6°/天。 <div>
This paper describes a new way of determining the high-latitude solar rotation rate statistically from simultaneous observations of many polar faculae. In this experiment, I extracted frames from a movie made previously from flat-fielded images obtained in the 6767 Å continuum during 1997–1998 February and used those frames to construct spacetime maps from high-latitude slices of the favorably oriented south polar cap. These maps show an array of slanted tracks whose average slope indicates the east–west speed of faculae at that latitude, λs. When the slopes are measured and plotted as a function of latitude, they show relatively little scatter ∼ 0.01–02 km s−1 from a straight line whose zero-speed extension passes through the Sun’s south pole. This means that the speed, v(λs), and the latitudinal radius, , approach 0 at the same rate, so that their ratio gives a nearly constant synodic rotation rate ∼8.°6 day−1 surrounding the Sun’s south pole. A few measurements of the unfavorably oriented north polar cap are consistent with these measurements near the south pole.

总结:<br />
本研究通过比较ALMA观测的盘半径和毫米波观测的气体表面密度，自洽地确定了气体和尘埃飘移时间。研究发现，符合测量尘埃质量的气体表面密度剖面具有非常短的漂移时间尺度，比恒星年龄短一个数量级或更长。对于处于重力不稳定边缘的盘，漂移时间尺度与恒星寿命相当。这适用于尘埃质量≳5地球质量的盘，在不到1百万年到10亿年的绝对年龄范围内。所推断的盘质量与恒星质量成比例。这种对毫米波观测的解释同时解决了关于尘埃寿命和外行星质量预算的两个长期问题，并建议将毫米波波长观测视为对具有广泛尺寸分布和大型行星体盘的潜在种群的窗口。 <div>
Millimeter emitting dust grains have sizes that make them susceptible to drift in protoplanetary disks due to the difference between their orbital speed and that of the gas. The characteristic drift timescale depends on the surface density of the gas. By comparing disk radius measurements from Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array CO and continuum observations at millimeter wavelengths, the gas surface density profile and dust drift time can be self-consistently determined. We find that profiles which match the measured dust mass have very short drift timescales, an order of magnitude or more shorter than the stellar age, whereas profiles for disks that are on the cusp of gravitational instability, defined via the minimum value of the Toomre parameter, , have drift timescales comparable to the stellar lifetime. This holds for disks with masses of dust ≳5 M⊕ across a range of absolute ages from less than 1 Myr to over 10 Myr. The inferred disk masses scale with stellar mass as . This interpretation of the gas and dust disk sizes simultaneously solves two long standing issues regarding the dust lifetime and exoplanet mass budget, and suggests that we consider millimeter wavelength observations as a window into an underlying population of particles with a wide size distribution in secular evolution with a massive planetesimal disk.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究报告了在Pierre Auger Observatory进行的为期19年的观测中探测到的超高能宇宙射线到达方向的大尺度各向异性测量结果。研究重建了4个能量段内4 EeV以上的3D偶极子幅度和方向。除了已确认的R.A.大于8 EeV的偶极各向异性外，现在8-16 EeV能量段的傅里叶振幅也超过了5σ的发现水平。在8 EeV以上的偶极矩没有发现时间变化，95%置信水平上将这种变化的变化率上限设置为0.3% yr−1。此外，展示了角功率谱的结果，证明没有其他统计显着的多极子。还首次提出了赤道偶极子分量的结果，使用了针对较低能量优化的触发器所获得的数据集。最后，讨论了模型预测并与观测进行了比较，这是基于在0.6 EeV以上的能谱和成分的联合拟合中获得的两种源发射场景。 <div>
Results are presented for the measurement of large-scale anisotropies in the arrival directions of ultra–high-energy cosmic rays detected at the Pierre Auger Observatory during 19 yr of operation, prior to AugerPrime, the upgrade of the observatory. The 3D dipole amplitude and direction are reconstructed above 4 EeV in four energy bins. Besides the established dipolar anisotropy in R.A. above 8 EeV, the Fourier amplitude of the 8–16 EeV energy bin is now also above the 5σ discovery level. No time variation of the dipole moment above 8 EeV is found, setting an upper limit to the rate of change of such variations of 0.3% yr−1 at the 95% confidence level. Additionally, the results for the angular power spectrum are shown, demonstrating no other statistically significant multipoles. The results for the equatorial dipole component down to 0.03 EeV are presented, using for the first time a data set obtained with a trigger that has been optimized for lower energies. Finally, model predictions are discussed and compared with observations, based on two source emission scenarios obtained in the combined fit of spectrum and composition above 0.6 EeV.

Neutron-induced nuclear reactions play an important role in the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. Their excitation functions are, from an experimental point of view, usually difficult to measure. Nevertheless, in the last decades, big efforts have led to a better understanding of their role in the primordial nucleosynthesis network. In this work, we apply the Trojan Horse Method to extract the cross section at astrophysical energies for the 3He(n,p)3H reaction after a detailed study of the 2H(3He,pt)H three-body process. Data extracted from the present measurement are compared with other published sets. The reaction rate is also calculated, and the impact on the Big Bang nucleosynthesis is examined in detail.

<div> 星系，形成历史，AGN驱动，快速熄灭，红移<br />
总结:<br />
研究表明，在年轻宇宙中的大质量静止星系可以分为三类：相对古老的星系在早期停止形成，最近迅速熄灭的星系，以及经历大规模恒星爆发后最近迅速熄灭的星系。大部分最近熄灭的星系显示中性气体流出，并有电离气体发射，显示出与活动星系核诊断一致的谱线比。这表明，AGN活动驱动多相气体流出，导致快速熄灭。通过追溯整个样本的形成历史，预测了在z = 4-6时期的大质量静止星系的数量密度。样本中的两个老年大质量静止星系可能是在z > 3时期早期恒星爆发的后代。这些星系仍然显示出中性气体储库和微弱的Hα发射，可能是因为导致快速熄灭的喷射式AGN反馈随着时间的推移而减弱。 <div>
Massive quiescent galaxies in the young Universe are expected to be quenched rapidly, but it is unclear whether they all experience starbursts before quenching and what physical mechanism drives rapid quenching. We study 14 massive quiescent galaxies ( ) at z ∼ 2 selected from a representative sample of the Blue Jay survey. We reconstruct their star formation histories (SFHs) by fitting spectral energy distribution models to the JWST/NIRSpec R ∼ 1000 spectra. We find that massive quiescent galaxies can be split into three categories with roughly equal numbers of galaxies according to their SFHs: (1) relatively old galaxies quenched at early epochs; (2) galaxies that are rapidly and recently quenched after a flat or bursty formation history (depending on the assumed prior); and (3) galaxies that are rapidly and recently quenched after a major starburst. Most recently quenched galaxies show neutral gas outflows, probed by blueshifted Na i D absorption, and ionized gas emission, with line ratios consistent with active galactic nucleus (AGN) diagnostics. This suggests that AGN activity drives multiphase gas outflows, leading to rapid quenching. By tracing back the SFHs of the entire sample, we predict the number density of massive quiescent galaxies at z = 4–6: n = (1.5–6.0) × 10−5 Mpc−3. The two old massive quiescent galaxies in our sample appear to have extremely early formation and quenching (z ≳ 6) and are possibly descendants of early post-starbursts at z > 3. These galaxies still show neutral gas reservoirs and weak Hα emission, perhaps because the ejective AGN feedback that caused rapid quenching has weakened over time.

We study a magnitude-limited sample of 36 broad-lined type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic-BL) from the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey (detected between 2018 March and 2021 August), which is the largest systematic study of SNe Ic-BL done in literature thus far. We present the light curves (LCs) for each of the SNe and analyze the shape of the LCs to derive empirical parameters, along with the explosion epochs for every event. The sample has an average absolute peak magnitude in the r band of mag. Using spectra obtained around peak light, we compute expansion velocities from the Fe ii 5169 Å line for each event with high enough signal-to-noise ratio spectra, and find an average value of km s−1. We also compute bolometric LCs, study the blackbody temperature and radii evolution over time, and derive the explosion properties of the SNe. The explosion properties of the sample have average values of , , and erg. Thirteen events have radio observations from the Very Large Array, with eight detections and five non-detections. We find that the populations that have radio detections and radio non-detections are indistinct from one another with respect to their optically inferred explosion properties, and there are no statistically significant correlations present between the events’ radio luminosities and optically inferred explosion properties. This provides evidence that the explosion properties derived from optical data alone cannot give inferences about the radio properties of SNe Ic-BL and likely their relativistic jet formation mechanisms.

Using a combination of Hubble Space Telescope (HST), JWST, and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) data, we perform spatially resolved spectral energy distributions (SED) fitting of fourteen 4 < z < 6 ultraviolet (UV)-selected main-sequence galaxies targeted by the ALMA Large Program [C ii] Resolved ISM in Star-forming Galaxies. We consistently model the emission from stars and dust in ∼0.5–1 kpc spatial bins to obtain maps of their physical properties. We find no offsets between the stellar masses (M*) and star formation rates (SFRs) derived from their global emission and those from adding up the values in our spatial bins, suggesting there is no bias of outshining by young stars on the derived global properties. We show that ALMA observations are important to derive robust parameter maps because they reduce the uncertainties in Ldust (hence, AV and SFR). Using these maps, we explore the resolved star-forming main sequence for z ∼ 5 galaxies, finding that this relation persists in typical star-forming galaxies in the early Universe. We find less obscured star formation where the M* (and SFR) surface densities are highest, typically in the central regions, contrary to the global relation between these parameters. We speculate this could be caused by feedback driving gas and dust out of these regions. However, more observations of IR luminosities with ALMA are needed to verify this. Finally, we test empirical SFR prescriptions based on the UV+IR and [C ii] line luminosity, finding they work well at the scales probed (approximately kiloparsec). Our work demonstrates the usefulness of joint HST-, JWST-, and ALMA-resolved SED modeling analyses at high redshift.

We present a comprehensive analysis of the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of the extreme high-energy peaked BL Lac source, 1ES 0229+200. Our study utilizes near-simultaneous data collected at various epochs between 2017 September and 2021 August (MJD 58119−59365) from different instruments, including AstroSat−UVIT, Soft X-ray focusing Telescope, LAXPC, Swift−UVOT, Fermi-LAT, and MAGIC. We investigate the one-zone synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model, employing diverse particle distributions such as the log parabola, broken power law, power law with a maximum electron energy γ, energy-dependent diffusion (EDD), and energy-dependent acceleration (EDA) models to fit the broadband SED of the source. Our findings indicate that both peaks in the SED are well described by the one-zone SSC model across all particle distribution models. We estimate the jet power for different particle distributions. The estimated jet power for broken power law particle distributions is found to be on the order of 1047 (1044) erg s−1 for a minimum electron energy ∼10 (104). However, for intrinsically curved particle energy distributions (e.g., log parabola, EDD, and EDA models), the estimated jet power is ∼1044 erg s−1. The SED fitting at five epochs enables us to explore the correlation between the derived spectral parameters of various particle distribution models. Notably, the observed correlations are inconsistent with the predictions in the power-law with a maximum γ model, although the EDD and EDA models yield the correlations as expected. Moreover, the estimated physical parameter values are consistent with the model assumptions.

Population III stars, metal-poor stars, initial mass distribution, supernova explosions, explodability theory <div>
The most metal-poor stars record the earliest metal enrichment triggered by Population III stars. By comparing observed abundance patterns with theoretical yields of metal-free stars, physical properties of their first star progenitors can be inferred, including zero-age main-sequence mass and explosion energy. In this work, the initial mass distribution of the first stars is obtained from the largest analysis to date of 406 very metal-poor stars with the newest LAMOST/Subaru high-resolution spectroscopic observations. However, the mass distribution fails to be consistent with the Salpeter initial mass function, which is also reported by previous studies. Here, we modify the standard power-law function with explodability theory. The mass distribution of Population III stars could be well explained by ensuring that the initial metal enrichment originates from successful supernova explosions. Based on the modified power-law function, we suggest an extremely top-heavy or nearly flat initial mass function with a large exponent for the explosion energy. This indicates that supernova explodability should be considered in the earliest metal enrichment process in the Universe.

粘性在星团中间介质中的影响仍然是天体物理学中一个未解之谜。通过使用OpenGadget3平滑粒子磁流体动力学代码对三个质量大于1015M⊙的星团进行了宇宙学模拟，以量化粘性的影响并限制其值。研究结果显示粘性引起了小尺度上的显著形态差异、温度变化和密度波动。我们观察到小尺度不稳定性的抑制，导致了更多的小结构和更丝状的结构，同时也由于缺乏与介质的混合。动能向内能的转化导致星团的维里温度增加了大约5%–10%，而密度较高的区域保持较低的温度。密度和速度波动的幅度发现会随粘性增加而增加。然而，与观测数据的比较表明，尽管粘性不同，模拟结果仍然符合密度波动幅度的观测斜率，挑战了通过仅通过密度波动直接限制粘性的观点。此外，密度波动与速度波动的比率不受粘性量的影响，与理论预期一致。我们的结果首次在星团的宇宙学模拟中呈现了粘性在星团中间介质中的影响，而这方面的研究在当前文献中尚未有报道。 <div>
The impact of viscosity in the intracluster medium (ICM) is still an open question in astrophysics. To address this problem, we have run a set of cosmological simulations of three galaxy clusters with a mass larger than MVir > 1015M⊙ at z = 0 using the smoothed particle magnetohydrodynamics-code OpenGadget3. We aim to quantify the influence of viscosity and constrain its value in the ICM. Our results show significant morphological differences at small scales, temperature variations, and density fluctuations induced by viscosity. We observe a suppression of instabilities at small scales, resulting in a more filamentary structure and a larger amount of small structures due to the lack of mixing with the medium. The conversion of kinetic to internal energy leads to an increase of the virial temperature of the cluster of ∼5%–10%, while the denser regions remain cold. The amplitude of density and velocity fluctuations are found to increase with viscosity. However, comparison with observational data indicates that the simulations, regardless of the viscosity, match the observed slope of the amplitude of density fluctuations, challenging the direct constraint of viscosity solely through density fluctuations. Furthermore, the ratio of density to velocity fluctuations remains close to 1 regardless of the amount of viscosity, in agreement with the theoretical expectations. Our results show for the first time in a cosmological simulation of a galaxy cluster the effect of viscosity in the ICM, a study that is currently missing in the literature.

<div> 关键词：超陡谱、射电晕、星系团、X射线、巨型米波射电望远镜

总结:
本研究首次对星系团PLCKESZ G171.94−40.65中的超陡谱射电晕进行了多频分析，利用升级后的巨型米波射电望远镜（400兆赫）和卡尔·G·詹斯基超大尺度阵列（1–2千兆赫）观测数据。射电数据辅以Chandra X射线观测数据，为了了解发生在大尺度的星系团内部介质的复杂物理过程提供了关键见解。研究发现射电晕辐射范围约1.5兆秒差距，比以往报道的范围大得多，并发现中心区域有五个尾状星系，以及在星系团外围发现一个名为“U”的未知弥散源，范围为300千秒差距。通过现有观测，发现射电晕的射电谱与单一幂律拟合良好，具有-1.36±0.05的谱指数，表明它并非超陡谱射电晕。X射线和射电表面亮度在形态上呈现出一致性，且呈现出沿西北-东南方向的轻微延伸。射电和X射线表面亮度呈现出明显正相关，相关斜率约为0.71，表明星系团中心区域存在较强的动力活动。<br /><br /> <div>
We present the first multifrequency analysis of the candidate ultrasteep spectrum radio halo in the galaxy cluster PLCKESZ G171.94−40.65, using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio telescope (400 MHz), and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (1–2 GHz) observations. Our radio data have been complemented with archival Chandra X-ray observations to provide a crucial insight into the complex intracluster medium physics, happening at large scales. We detect the radio halo emission to the extent of ∼1.5 Mpc at 400 MHz, significantly larger than previously reported, along with five tailed galaxies in the central region. We also report the discovery of an unknown diffuse source “U,” at the cluster periphery, with an extent of 300 kpc. Using the available observations, we have found that the radio spectrum of the halo is well-fitted with a single power law, having a spectral index of −1.36 ± 0.05, indicating that it is not an ultrasteep spectrum radio halo. Our low-resolution (25″) resolved spectral map shows an overall uniform spectral index, with some patches of fluctuations. The X-ray and radio surface brightness are morphologically cospatial, with a slight extension along the northwest–southeast direction, seen in both maps. The radio and X-ray surface brightness indicates strong positive correlations, with sublinear correlation slopes (∼0.71). Multiple tailed galaxies and the radio halo indicate a high dynamical activity at the cluster central region.

本文重点研究M型恒星的恒星风特性及其在TRAPPIST-1和Proxima Centauri等恒星系中可能产生的影响。M型恒星在宇宙中最为常见，由于其尺寸小、温度低，适合用于搜寻宜居区内的太阳系外行星。但是它们的恒星风特性及恒星-行星磁场相互作用可能与太阳系内的情况大不相同。本文通过Alfvén波驱动的恒星风模型，重新评估了M矮星的恒星风特性，并发现TRAPPIST-1行星很可能处于Alfvén表面内，这意味着这些行星可能受到星-行星磁场相互作用的影响。此外，Proxima Cen b与其宿主恒星之间的磁场相互作用可能是最近观测到的无线电发射的原因。这些研究结果有助于我们更好地了解M型恒星及其周围行星的环境特性。 
<br />总结: <br />本文研究了M型恒星的恒星风特性，通过Alfvén波驱动的模型重新评估了TRAPPIST-1和Proxima Centauri等恒星系中的恒星风特性，并指出了可能存在的星-行星磁场相互作用以及其可能引发的无线电发射。 <div>
M-type stars are the most common stars in the Universe. They are ideal hosts for the search of exoplanets in the habitable zone (HZ), as their small size and low temperature make the HZ much closer-in than their solar twins. Harboring very deep convective layers, they also usually exhibit very intense magnetic fields. Understanding their environment, in particular their coronal and wind properties, is thus very important, as they might be very different from what is observed in the solar system. The mass-loss rate of M-type stars is poorly known observationally, and recent attempts to estimate it for some of them (e.g., TRAPPIST-1 and Proxima Centauri) can vary by an order of magnitude. In this work, we revisit the stellar wind properties of M dwarfs in the light of the latest estimates of through Lyα absorption at the astropause and slingshot prominences. We outline a modeling strategy to estimate the mass-loss rate, radiative loss, and wind speed, with uncertainties, based on an Alfvén-wave-driven stellar wind model. We find that it is very likely that several TRAPPIST-1 planets lie within the Alfvén surface, which implies that these planets experience star–planet magnetic interactions (SPMIs). We also find that SPMIs between Proxima Cen b and its host star could be the reason for recently observed radio emissions.

总结:
NGC 741的深度、宽频多频率射电观测揭示了NGC 741-742系统的复杂结构，包括NGC 742的冲击錐、NGC 742的受干扰射流、南部射电尾巴以及东部似叶状结构。同时，观测还显示了尾巴和叶状结构中复杂的射电丝状物质，以及冲击錐后可能存在的涡流环。NGC 742的冲击可能压缩并重新加速了射电等离子体，并向IGrM中注入了大量热能。观测结果还表明，X射线和射电的某些热丝状结构相吻合，暗示了NGC 742尾部的相对论等离子体与周围介质的相互作用。这些发现强调了多频观测对于解析NGC 741中各种射电特征的复杂起源至关重要，同时也需要模拟才能复现所有检测到的特征。 <div>
We present deep, wideband multifrequency radio observations (144 MHz−8 GHz) of the remarkable galaxy group NGC 741, which yield crucial insights into the interaction between the infalling head-tail radio galaxy (NGC 742) and the main group. Our new data provide an unprecedentedly detailed view of the NGC 741-742 system, including the shock cone, disrupted jets from NGC 742, the long (∼255 kpc) braided southern radio tail, and the eastern lobe-like structure (∼100 kpc), and reveal, for the first time, complex radio filaments throughout the tail and lobe, and a likely vortex ring behind the shock cone. The cone traces the bow shock caused by the supersonic ( ) interaction between the head-tail radio galaxy NGC 742 and the intragroup medium (IGrM), while the ring may have been formed by the interaction between the NGC 742 shock and a previously existing lobe associated with NGC 741. This interaction plausibly compressed and reaccelerated the radio plasma. We estimate that shock-heating by NGC 742 has likely injected ∼2–5 × 1057 erg of thermal energy into the central 10 kpc cooling region of the IGrM, potentially affecting the cooling and feedback cycle of NGC 741. A comparison with Chandra X-ray images shows that some of the previously detected thermal filaments align with radio edges, suggesting compression of the IGrM as the relativistic plasma of the NGC 742 tail interacts with the surrounding medium. Our results highlight that multifrequency observations are key to disentangling the complex, intertwined origins of the variety of radio features seen in the galaxy group NGC 741, and the need for simulations to reproduce all the detected features.

<div> 关键词: 超大质量黑洞，活跃星系核，伽马射线暴，相对论性喷流，前向和后向冲击波

总结:
超大质量黑洞（SMBH）在活跃星系核（AGN）中的吸积盘被认为是产生不同类型的伽马射线暴（GRB）的理想地点。通过研究因喷流与AGN盘物质相互作用而导致的反向和正向冲击动力学，发现只有在足够高的亮度和足够长的持续时间下，相对论喷流才能成功从盘中突破。与普通的GRB喷流相比，相对较正常的GRB喷流更容易被窒息在盘中，除非GRB发生在质量相对较低的SMBH附近（例如∼106M⊙）。对于被窒息的喷流来说，与正常的GRB即时和余辉辐射不同，我们只能期望在冲击波非常接近盘的边缘时检测到来自正向冲击的辐射，即冲击波爆发辐射和随后的冲击冷却。 <div>
The accretion disks of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) harboring in active galactic nuclei (AGN) are considered to be an ideal site for producing different types of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The detectability of these GRB phenomena hidden in AGN disks is highly dependent on the dynamical evolution of the GRB relativistic jets. By investigating the reverse- and forward-shock dynamics due to the interaction between the jets and AGN disk material, we find that the relativistic jets can successfully break out from the disks only for a sufficiently high luminosity and a long enough duration. In comparison, relatively normal GRB jets are inclined to be choked in the disks unless the GRBs occur near an SMBH with relatively low mass (e.g., ∼106M⊙). For the choked jets, unlike normal GRB prompt and afterglow emission, we can only expect to detect emission from the forward shock when the shock is very close to the edge of the disks, i.e., at the shock breakout emission and subsequent cooling of the shock.

长型GRB与融合相关，短型GRB与恒星坍缩相关。然而，“奇特GRB”挑战了传统分类。研究发现，长型GRB几乎总是类似于Type I GRB，这暗示融合可能产生T90 > 2s的GRB。而根据红移分布的概率，发现短型GRB几乎表现出与Type II GRB类似的特性，这表明短型Type II GRB的数量并不稀少，而是隐藏在大量没有红移的样本中。这不利于推断射流的进展导致主要辐射被错过。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究分析了机器学习识别的长型Type I GRB和短型Type II GRB候选者的特性，发现长型GRB-I几乎始终表现出与Type I GRB类似的特性，而短型GRB-II几乎表现出与Type II GRB类似的特性。这暗示了融合可能产生T90大于2秒的GRB，而短型Type II GRB的数量并不稀少，而是隐藏在大量没有红移的样本中。 <div>
Traditionally, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are classified as long and short GRBs, with T90 = 2 s being the threshold duration. Generally, long-duration GRBs (LGRBs; T90 > 2 s) are associated with the collapse of massive stars, and short-duration (SGRBs; T90 < 2 s) are associated with compact binary mergers involving at least one neutron star. However, the existence of a population of so-called “peculiar GRBs”—i.e., LGRBs originating from mergers or long Type I GRBs, and SGRBs originating from collapsars or short Type II GRBs—has challenged the traditional paradigm of GRB classification. Finding more peculiar GRBs may help to give more insight into this issue. In this work, we analyze the properties of machine-learning-identified long Type I GRB and short Type II GRB candidates, long GRBs-I and short GRBs-II (the so-called “peculiar GRBs”). We find that long GRBs-I almost always exhibit properties similar to Type I GRBs, which suggests that mergers may indeed produce GRBs with T90 > 2 s. Furthermore, according to the probability given by the redshift distribution, short GRBs-II almost exhibit properties similar to Type II GRBs. This suggests that the populations of short Type II GRBs are not scarce and that they are hidden in a large number of samples without redshifts, which is unfavorable for the interpretation that the jet progression leads to a missed main emission.

We present a broadband spectral analysis of the soft-intermediate and soft states using Insight-HXMT observations of the black hole binary MAXI J1348–630 during its outburst in 2019. We employ a combination of reflection and continuum fitting methods to measure the spin of the black hole and determine a spin of a = 0.79 ± 0.13, which is consistent with most of the previous results. Additionally, we investigate some sources of systematic uncertainty that could bias the measurement. The valid spectral hardening factor can partially account for the spin evolution observed during the outburst. Other potential factors, such as assumptions about the corona’s structure and their interaction with reflected photons, can also affect the accuracy of spin measurements. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that MAXI J1348–630 exhibits a significantly high disk density (∼1022 cm−3), with a moderate iron abundance of approximately 2.5 times solar.

<div> 关键词: 低质量星系，星形成历史，James Webb太空望远镜，Epoch of Reionization，红移

总结: 本文报告了对低质量孤立星系Leo P的JWST观测结果，揭示了其星形成历史的重要发现。研究发现Leo P在再电离纪时期经历了早期星形成，随后出现了暂停，而后又重新点燃了星形成过程。这与之前研究发现的其他矮星系的星形成历史非常相似。对Leo P的久期星形成历史的发现揭示了在红移约5到1期间星形成的停滞现象，对低质量星系在中间红移的紫外光子产生的贡献具有重要意义。同时，研究还表明，使用两个NIRCam短波长滤波器进行观测优于使用一个短波长和一个长波长滤波器。 <div>
Isolated, low-mass galaxies provide the opportunity to assess the impact of reionization on their star formation histories (SFHs) without the ambiguity of environmental processes associated with massive host galaxies. There are very few isolated, low-mass galaxies that are close enough to determine their SFHs from resolved star photometry reaching below the oldest main-sequence turnoff. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has increased the volume for which this is possible, and here we report on JWST observations of the low-mass, isolated galaxy Leo P. From NIRCam imaging in F090W, F150W, and F277W, we derive an SFH that shows early star formation followed by a pause subsequent to the Epoch of Reionization, which is then later followed by a reignition of star formation. This is very similar to the SFHs from previous studies of other dwarf galaxies in the “transition zone” between quenched very-low-mass galaxies and the more massive galaxies that show no evidence of the impact of reionization on their SFHs; this pattern is rarely produced in simulations of SFHs. The lifetime SFH reveals that Leo P’s stellar mass at the Epoch of Reionization was in the range that is normally associated with being totally quenched. The extended pause in star formation from z ∼ 5 to 1 has important implications for the contribution of low-mass galaxies to the ultraviolet photon budget at intermediate redshifts. We also demonstrate that, due to higher sensitivity and angular resolution, observing in two NIRCam short-wavelength filters is superior to observing in a combination of a short- and a long-wavelength filter.

总结:
本研究对局部（z = 0.0315）活跃星系核(AgN) Mrk 817进行了超过500天的监测，使用了航天器和地面仪器，采用详细建模分析了宽线区域（BLR）、几种区分其光学深度的盘风，以及新的数值模拟。研究发现，扩散的连续光（DC）发射以及强烈而宽广的发射线的附加贡献可以解释在高和低亮度阶段观察到的连续光滞后。我们的BLR模型假设分布在2-122光天距离的受辐射压束缚的云。我们还提出了许多发射线和DC发射的平均发射半径的计算值，并提出了一个简单的、与传递函数相关的方法，将它们与交叉相关滞后的测定联系起来。我们没有发现大光学深度风的明确迹象，但鉴定了较低柱密度风的特征。特别是，我们将观察到的最短连续光滞后与τ(1 Ryd)≈2的风以及部分受到屏蔽的BLR相结合。即使较小光学深度的风，也可能与X射线吸收特征有关，并且会导致一些高电离线的宽度和滞后时间的显著变化，如He ii和C iv。最后，我们展示了环尘发射对i和z波段观察滞后时间的影响。 <div>
The local (z = 0.0315) active galactic nucleus (AGN) Mrk 817 was monitored over more than 500 days with space-borne and ground-based instruments as part of a large international campaign, AGN STORM 2. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the broadband continuum variations using detailed modeling of the broad line region (BLR), several types of disk winds classified by their optical depth, and new numerical simulations. We find that diffuse continuum (DC) emission, with additional contributions from strong and broad emission lines, can explain the continuum lags observed in this source during high- and low-luminosity phases. Disk illumination by the variable X-ray corona contributes only a small fraction of the observed continuum lags. Our BLR models assume radiation-pressure-confined clouds distributed over a distance of 2–122 light days. We present calculated mean emissivity radii of many emission lines, and DC emission, and suggest a simple, transfer-function-dependent method that ties them to cross-correlation lag determinations. We do not find clear indications for large-optical-depth winds, but identify the signature of lower-column-density winds. In particular, we associate the shortest observed continuum lags with a combination of τ(1 Ryd) ≈ 2 wind and a partly shielded BLR. Even smaller optical depth winds may be associated with X-ray absorption features and with noticeable variations in the widths and lags of several high-ionization lines like He ii and C iv. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of torus dust emission on the observed lags in the i and z bands.

Recent constraints on neutron star mass and radius have advanced our understanding of the equation of state (EOS) of cold dense matter. Some of them have been obtained by modeling the pulses of three millisecond X-ray pulsars observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). Here, we present a Bayesian parameter inference for a fourth pulsar, PSR J1231−1411, using the same technique with NICER and XMM-Newton data. When applying a broad mass-inclination prior from radio timing measurements and the emission region geometry model that can best explain the data, we find likely converged results only when using a limited radius prior. If limiting the radius to be consistent with the previous observational constraints and EOS analyses, we infer the radius to be 12.6 ± 0.3 km and the mass to be M⊙, each reported as the posterior credible interval bounded by the 16% and 84% quantiles. If using an uninformative prior but limited between 10 and 14 km, we find otherwise similar results, but km for the radius. In both cases, we find a nonantipodal hot region geometry where one emitting spot is at the equator or slightly above, surrounded by a large colder region, and where a noncircular hot region lies close to southern rotational pole. If using a wider radius prior, we only find solutions that fit the data significantly worse. We discuss the challenges in finding the better fitting solutions, possibly related to the weak interpulse feature in the pulse profile.

We solve for waves in a polytropic, stratified plasma with a spatially varying background magnetic field that points along the horizontal x-direction, and with gravity that is directed along the vertical z-direction. Force balance determines the magnitude of the background magnetic field, , where n is the polytropic index. Using numerical and asymptotic methods, we deduce an explicit dispersion relation for fast pressure-driven waves: + . Here, Ω is the frequency, K is the wavenumber, θ is the angle the wavevector makes with the background magnetic field, MA is the Alfvénic Mach number, and m is an integer representing the eigenstate. We discuss the roles of such an explicit formula in asteroseismology.

PSR J1846−0258 is a young 327 ms radio-quiet pulsar with a large rotational power (∼8 × 1036 erg s−1), and resides at the center of the supernova remnant Kes 75. It is one of the rare examples of a high-magnetic-field pulsar showing characteristics both of magnetars and radio pulsars, and can thus provide important clues on the differences in the emission mechanisms between these two classes. In 2006, PSR J1846−0258 was detected to undergo an outburst for the first time, accompanied by a large flux increase, millisecond X-ray bursts, significant spectral changes, and a large timing glitch. In the period between 2020 May and June, after 14 yr of quiescent stable emission, the source underwent a second magnetar-like outburst, which was followed up with several observations by Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and Swift. In this work, we report on the long-term timing and X-ray spectral properties of the source following the 2020 outburst, and place upper limits on any source activity at radio wavelengths. We demonstrate that the pulsed flux increased by a factor >6 during the outburst, followed by nontrivial variability in the spin-down rate. Our timing analysis shows that the spin frequency and its derivative are clearly affected by magnetospheric activity due to the outburst. We find hints for an oscillation in the frequency derivative with a timescale of 50–60 days, recovering later on to stable quiescence.

<div> 关键词: 长伽马射线暴, 星亲, 爆发, 环周介质, 同步辐射

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了长伽马射线暴（GRBs）的星亲星可能被在巴赛克尺度距离上存在的一个重要且复杂的星云结构所围绕。在GRB射流释放能量后，射流将与这个星云环境相互作用。作者指出，在大部分情况下，射流冲击波与风终结（逆向）冲击的相互作用会比较弱，并且可能导致前驱辐射。另外，当射流冲击波遇到压缩至风和星际介质的接触不连续面时，新形成的逆向冲击产生了一次明亮的同步辐射闪耀。这个闪耀预计会在最初爆炸后大约100秒左右被观察到。因此，这个延迟的辐射构成了GRB的环周介质阶段，其物理起源不同于前期的快速爆发和后期的余辉阶段。环周介质阶段的辐射可以为观察到有前期辐射的、随后是强烈、以同步辐射为主的主要阶段的GRBs提供一个自然的解释。因此，正确识别辐射阶段对推断GRB星亲周围环境的性质至关重要。 <div>
Progenitor stars of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) could be surrounded by a significant and complex nebula structure lying at a parsec-scale distance. After the initial release of energy from the GRB jet, the jet will interact with this nebula environment. We show here that for a large, plausible parameter space region, the interaction between the jet blast wave and the wind termination (reverse) shock is expected to be weak, and may be associated with a precursor emission. As the jet blast wave encounters the contact discontinuity separating the shocked wind and the shocked interstellar medium, we find that a bright flash of synchrotron emission from the newly formed reverse shock is produced. This flash is expected to be observed at around ∼100 s after the initial explosion and precursor. Such a delayed emission thus constitutes a circumburst medium (CBM) phase in a GRB, having a physically distinct origin from the preceding prompt phase and the succeeding afterglow phase. The CBM phase emission may thus provide a natural explanation for bursts observed to have a precursor followed by an intense, synchrotron-dominated main episode that is found in a substantial minority, ∼10% of GRBs. A correct identification of the emission phase is thus required to infer the properties of the flow and of the immediate environment around GRB progenitors.

在这篇文章中，作者使用了高斯-博尔茨曼模型来预测银河系类似星系中解体星团的总数、质量和径向分布。他们还通过模拟这些祖先星团的轨道历史生成了虚拟的恒星串流，考虑了星团的形成和并入时间、质量和金属丰度。结果显示，在银河中，约9000个质量大于104M⊙的星团已经在中央星团溶解并在目前完全混合，而剩下的约1000个形成了一致的恒星串流。这表明目前对银河中约80个星团串流的普查严重不完整，15千秒巴赫光度（g ≲ 27.5）的深度拉宾光度测量将能够检测到这些串流，即使是距离银河中心超过75千秒巴赫的最遥远的串流。研究还发现M31在30-100千秒巴赫的银心辐射范围内将有大量串流存在。作者总结指出，未来的调查将发现大量来自星团的恒星串流，并可用于暗物质亚环的搜索。 <br /><br />总结: 作者使用高斯-博尔茨曼模型预测银河系类似星系中解体星团的总数、质量和径向分布。根据模拟结果，约9000个星团已经在中央星团溶解并在目前完全混合，而剩下的约1000个形成了一致的恒星串流。未来的调查将发现大量来自星团的恒星串流，并可用于暗物质亚环的搜索。 <div>
Thin stellar streams originating from globular clusters (GCs) are among the most sensitive tracers of low-mass dark matter subhalos. Joint analysis of the entire population of stellar streams will place the most robust constraints on the dark matter subhalo mass function, and therefore the nature of dark matter. Here we use a hierarchical model of GC formation to forecast the total number, masses, and radial distribution of dissolved GC in Milky Way–like galaxies. Furthermore, we generate mock stellar streams from these progenitors’ orbital histories taking into account the clusters’ formation and accretion times, mass, and metallicity. Out of ∼10,000 clusters more massive than 104M⊙, ∼9000 dissolved in the central bulge and are fully phase mixed at the present, while the remaining ∼1000 survive as coherent stellar streams. This suggests that the current census of ∼80 GC streams in the Milky Way is severely incomplete. Beyond 15 kpc from the Galactic center we are missing ∼100 streams, of which the vast majority are from accreted GCs. Deep Rubin photometry (g ≲ 27.5) would be able to detect these streams, even the most distant ones beyond >75 kpc. We also find that M31 will have an abundance of streams at galactocentric radii of 30–100 kpc. We conclude that future surveys will find a multitude of stellar streams from GCs, which can be used for dark matter subhalo searches.

The Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a cosmic-ray detector as well as a pair-converting γ-ray telescope. The effective area, reflecting the geometrical cross-section area, the γ-ray conversion probability, and the photon selection efficiency, is important in γ-ray analyses. In this work, we find a significant time variation in the effective area, as large as ∼−4% yr−1 at 2 GeV for the high-energy trigger. We derive the data-based correction factors to the effective areas and apply corrections to both the effective areas and the exposure maps. The calibrated exposure can be ∼12% smaller than the Monte Carlo one on average at 2 GeV. The calibration is further verified using the observation of the Vela pulsar, showing the spectral parameters with the correction are more consistent with those in the Fermi-LAT catalog than the ones without correction. All the corrections are now implemented in the latest version of the DAMPE γ-ray analysis toolkit DmpST.

总结:
X射线爆发和快速射电爆发之间存在关联，但其确切起源仍不清楚。文章提出了三种模型：火球的共振旋转散射、极向阻滞膨胀火球的流出以及远处相对论冲击的同步辐射。研究者通过计算每个模型的X射线光谱，并拟合观测数据，然后计算相应的偏振信号。发现这三种模型在相位/时间和能量变化的偏振模式上有所不同，可以通过未来的X射线极化观测来验证模型。 <div>
The origin of an extraordinary X-ray burst (XRB) associated with a fast radio burst (FRB) such as FRB 20200428 is still unclear, though several models, such as the emission of a trapped fireball modified by resonant cyclotron scattering, the outflow from a polar trapped-expanding fireball, and the synchrotron radiation of a far-away relativistic shock, have been proposed. To determine which model is true, we study the possible X-ray polarization signature for each model, inspired by the importance of radio polarization in identifying the FRB origin. We first numerically simulate or calculate the XRB spectrum for each model and fit it to the observed data, then compute the corresponding polarization signal based on the fit. We find that these three models predict different polarization patterns in terms of phase/time and energy variations. The differences can be used to test the models with future X-ray polarization observations.

We present periodicity search analyses on the long-term γ-ray light curve of the BL Lacertae object 4FGL J2139.4−4235 observed by the Fermi Large Area Telescope, over a period of more than 15 yr, from 2008 August 4 to 2023 December 10. To determine the quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) behavior of 4FGL J2139.4−4235 in the 0.3–300 GeV energy range, we used four methods, namely the Lomb–Scargle periodogram, the weighted wavelet z-transform, the phase dispersion minimization, and the autoregressive integrated moving average model. A Monte Carlo simulation technique is used to evaluate the significance level of the QPO signal. Significant levels above 3.5σ were detected in the γ-ray light curve at about 650 days QPO, which is presented throughout the observation period. Interestingly, there was some correlation between the three bands in the discrete correlation function method calculations, which may be an indication that the variability trends between the three bands are similar. We explore the possible physical models and show that a supermassive binary black hole system or a jet helical motion model seem to be reasonable explanations for the potential QPO behavior.

Planet–disk interactions can produce kinematic signatures in protoplanetary disks. While recent observations have detected non-Keplerian gas motions in disks, their origins are still being debated. To explore this, we conduct 3D hydrodynamic simulations using the code FARGO3D to study nonaxisymmetric kinematic perturbations at two scale heights induced by Jovian planets in protoplanetary disks, followed by examinations of detectable signals in synthetic CO emission line observations at millimeter wavelengths. We advocate for using residual velocity or channel maps, generated by subtracting an azimuthally averaged background of the disk, to identify planet-induced kinematic perturbations. We investigate the effects of two basic simulation parameters, simulation duration and numerical resolution, on the simulation results. Our findings suggest that a short simulation (e.g., 100 orbits) is insufficient to establish a steady velocity pattern given our chosen viscosity (α = 10−3) and displays plenty of fluctuations on an orbital timescale. Such transient features could be detected in observations. By contrast, a long simulation (e.g., 1000 orbits) is required to reach steady state in kinematic structures. At 1000 orbits, the strongest detectable velocity structures are found in the spiral wakes close to the planet. Through numerical convergence tests, we find hydrodynamics results converge in spiral regions at a resolution of 14 cells per disk scale height or higher. Meanwhile, synthetic observations produced from hydrodynamic simulations at different resolutions are indistinguishable with 0.″1 angular resolution and 10 hr of integration time on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array.

<br /><br />总结:
本文讨论了暗物质的聚集现象与其质量（主要偏差）和内部性质（次要偏差）之间的关系。研究表明，暗物质的聚集不仅取决于其质量，还与其内部属性有关。之前将次要偏差归因于不同背景下暗物质的合并速率，称之为组装偏差，但实际上合并对内部属性没有留下痕迹。更现实的峰值模型表明，暗物质种子由峰值曲率确定，不同背景下的峰值具有不同的平均曲率，这决定了它们演化为具有不同内部属性的暗物质聚集。对暗物质聚集的背景（或聚集）的内部属性依赖性进行了验证，结果与模拟的结果相吻合。 <div>
The clustering of dark matter halos depends not only on their mass, the so-called primary bias, but also on their internal properties, the so-called secondary bias. While the former effect is well understood within the Press–Schechter and excursion set models of structure formation, the latter is not. In those models, protohalos are fully characterized by their height and scale, which determine the halo mass and collapse time, so there is no room for any other halo property. This is why the secondary bias was believed not to be innate but due to the distinct merger rate of halos lying in different backgrounds, and dubbed assembly bias. However, it has now been determined that mergers leave no imprint in the inner halo properties. In fact, the innate origin of the secondary bias cannot be discarded because, in the more realistic peak model of structure formation, halo seeds are characterized by one additional property: the peak curvature. Here, we use the confluent system of peak trajectory formalism to show that peaks lying in different backgrounds have different mean curvatures, which in turn cause them to evolve into halos with different typical inner properties. The dependence we find of the properties on halo background (or halo clustering) reproduces the results of simulations.

Our analyses reveal a rotation period of EPIC 248705247 of approximately 6.82 ± 0.07 hr, making it one of the most rapidly rotating DBV stars currently known. We utilize the White Dwarf Evolution Code (WDEC) to compute models to look for the seismic best-fitted model, yielding the following stellar parameters: M/M⊙ = 0.650 ± 0.003, Teff = 23,660 ± 68 K, and . We also explore the phenomenon of mode trapping, as well as the potential influence of a weak magnetic field. We find that this star is located near the red edge of the theoretical instability strip of DBVs.

We investigate the long-term persistence of the time series of energetic neutral atom (ENA) fluxes recorded by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX). ENAs provide global information about the outer heliosphere and its interactions with the very local interstellar medium. To avoid the IBEX Ribbon, here, we focus our analysis solely on the polar regions N60°–N90° and S60°–S90°. Each year, IBEX takes two measurements of every pixel in the sky. We make use of the whole set of 14 yr of IBEX data and adhere to the correct time order for the construction of the flux time series. We examine in detail both the trend and the fluctuations of these time series. Using modern methods of time series analysis and persistence characterization, we show that the time series (i) trend is influenced by the solar cycle, (ii) persistence can be established independently of the presence of this trend, and (iii) statistical properties of the fluctuations differs between north and south, pointing to the existence of anisotropy and thus a north–south asymmetry.

总结: 中子星表面的辐射对质量吸积率产生影响，X射线爆发会导致Poynting–Robertson (PR) 拖曳对质量吸积盘的影响，提高质量吸积率。观测发现X射线爆发期间盘生成的持续辐射的标准化因子fa增加，fa的变化被用来推断质量吸积率的演化。研究使用模拟数据考察了fa与质量吸积率增强之间的关系，发现fa与盘温度强相关，但与质量吸积率的关联性较弱。同时，加热导致盘以更高能量辐射，减小其对软过量的贡献。因此，fa不能准确捕捉质量吸积率的增强，而更像是盘温度的示踪器。 <br /> <div>
The accretion flow onto a neutron star will be impacted by irradiation from a type I X-ray burst. The burst radiation exerts Poynting–Robertson (PR) drag on the accretion disk, leading to an enhanced mass accretion rate. Observations of X-ray bursts often find evidence that the normalization of the disk-generated persistent emission (commonly denoted by the factor fa) increases during a burst, and changes in fa have been used to infer the evolution of the mass accretion rate due to PR drag. Here, we examine this proposed relationship between fa and mass accretion rate enhancement using time-resolved data from simulations of accretion disks impacted by type I X-ray bursts. We consider bursts from both spinning and nonspinning neutron stars and track both the change in accretion rate due to PR drag and the disk emission spectra during the burst. Regardless of the neutron star spin, we find that fa strongly correlates with the disk temperature and only weakly follows the mass accretion rate (the Pearson correlation coefficients are ≤0.63 in the latter case). Additionally, heating causes the disk to emit at higher energies, reducing its contribution to a soft excess. We conclude that fa cannot accurately capture the mass accretion rate enhancement and is rather a tracer of the disk temperature.

Stellar ultraviolet (UV) emission serves as a crucial indicator for estimating magnetic activity and evaluating the habitability of exoplanets orbiting stars. In this paper, we present a straightforward method to derive stellar photospheric UV emission for F to M main-sequence stars. By using PARSEC models, we establish relations between near-UV (NUV) and far-UV (FUV) magnitudes from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer, NUV magnitudes from the China Space Station Telescope, and stellar effective temperatures and Gaia blue photometer–red photometer colors for different metallicities. Together with the observed sample, we find that for NUV emission, the photospheric contribution to the observed flux is less than 20% for M stars, around 10%–70% for K stars, and in a range from 30% to 85% for G and F stars. For FUV emission, the photospheric contribution is less than 10−6 for M stars, below 10−4 for K stars, around 10−4–10% for G stars, and between 6% and 50% for F stars. Our work enables the simple and effective determination of stellar excess UV emission and the exploration of magnetic activity.

Self-consistent strong plasma screening around light nuclei is implemented in the Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) epoch to determine the short-range screening potential, eϕ(r)/T ≥ 1, relevant for thermonuclear reactions. We numerically solve the nonlinear Poisson–Boltzmann equation incorporating Fermi–Dirac statistics, adopting a generalized screening mass to find the electric potential in the cosmic BBN electron–positron plasma for finite-sized α particles (4He++) as an example. Although the plasma follows Boltzmann statistics at large distances, Fermi–Dirac statistics is necessary when work performed by ions on electrons is comparable to their rest-mass energy. While self-consistent strong screening effects are generally minor owing to the high BBN temperatures, they can enhance the fusion rates of high-Z (Z > 2) elements while leaving fusion rates of lower-Z (Z ≤ 2) elements relatively unaffected. Our results also reveal a pronounced spatial dependence of the self-consistent strong screening potential near the nuclear surface. These findings about the electron–positron plasma’s role refine BBN theory predictions and offer broader applications for studying weakly coupled plasmas in diverse cosmic and laboratory settings.

<div> UV-bright galaxies, ultralight axion (ULA) dark matter, abundance, redshift, Hubble Space Telescope (HST)

总结:
本研究通过对Hubble Space Telescope (HST)观测的24,000个源的紫外光度函数（UVLF）数据进行分析，计算了紫外亮星系在超轻轴子（ULA）暗物质存在下的丰度。研究发现，轴子对紫外亮星系的形成有非平凡的抑制作用，并且这种抑制与红移和光度有关。通过对UVLF数据的分析，得出了轴子暗物质的限制，排除了单一轴子占据所有暗物质的可能性，并且限制了轴子占据暗物质的上限为22%（在95%的置信水平下）。这些高红移的测量结果为低红移轴子暗物质的检验提供了一个有力的一致性检查，并且未来James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) 的测量有望改善这些结果。同时，研究还发现了在z < 3时低质量暗物质（<109M⊙）的过剩，这可以通过亚星系结构探测（例如星流、卫星星系和强引力透镜）来研究。 <div>
We calculate the abundance of UV-bright galaxies in the presence of ultralight axion (ULA) dark matter (DM), finding that axions suppress their formation with a non-trivial dependence on redshift and luminosity. We set limits on axion DM using UV luminosity function (UVLF) data, excluding a single axion as all the DM for max < 10−21.6 eV and limiting axions with to be less than 22% of the DM (both at 95% credibility). These limits use UVLF measurements from 24,000 sources from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) at redshifts 4 ≤ z ≤ 10. We marginalize over a parametric model connecting halo mass and UV luminosity. Our results bridge a window in axion mass and fraction previously unconstrained by cosmological data, between large-scale cosmic microwave background and galaxy clustering and the small-scale Lyα forest. These high-z measurements provide a powerful consistency check of low-z tests of axion DM, including the recent hint for a sub-dominant ULA DM fraction in Lyα forest data. We also consider a sample of 25 spectroscopically confirmed high-z galaxies from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), finding these data to be consistent with HST. Combining HST and JWST UVLF data does not improve our constraints beyond HST alone, but future JWST measurements have the potential to improve these results. We also find an excess of low-mass halos (<109M⊙) at z < 3, which could be probed by subgalactic structure probes (e.g., stellar streams, satellite galaxies, and strong lensing).

Very-high-energy (0.1–100 TeV) gamma-ray emissions were observed in High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) data from the lobes of the microquasar SS 433, making them the first set of astrophysical jets that were resolved at TeV energies. In this work, we update the analysis of SS 433 using 2565 days of data from the HAWC observatory. Our analysis reports the detection of a point-like source in the east lobe at a significance of 6.6σ and in the west lobe at a significance of 8.2σ. For each jet lobe, we localize the gamma-ray emission and identify a best-fit position. The locations are close to the X-ray emission sites “e1” and “w1” for the east and west lobes, respectively. We analyze the spectral energy distributions and find that the energy spectra of the lobes are consistent with a simple power law dN/dE ∝ Eα with and for the east and west lobes, respectively. The maximum energy of photons from the east and west lobes reaches 56 TeV and 123 TeV, respectively. We compare our observations to various models and conclude that the very-high-energy gamma-ray emission can be produced by a population of electrons that were efficiently accelerated.

HOPS 87 is a Class 0 protostellar core known to harbor an extremely young bipolar outflow and a hot corino. We report the discovery of localized, chemically rich regions near the bases of the two-lobe bipolar molecular outflow in HOPS 87 containing molecules such as H2CO, 13CS, H2S, OCS, and CH3OH, the simplest complex organic molecule (COM). The locations and kinematics suggest that these localized features are due to jet-driven shocks rather than being part of the hot-corino region encasing the protostar. The COM compositions of the molecular gas in these jet-localized regions are relatively simpler than those in the hot-corino zone. We speculate that this simplicity is due to either the liberation of ice with a less complex chemical history or the effects of shock chemistry. Our study highlights the dynamic interplay between the protostellar bipolar outflow, disk, inner-core environment, and the surrounding medium, contributing to our understanding of molecular complexity in solar-like young stellar objects.

<div> refractory organics, C carrier, protosolar nebula, Kuiper Belt objects, CI chondrites
<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了在外太阳前星云中作为碳主要携带者的耐火性有机物的作用，以及对大冥王星带对象（KBOs）和CI球粒陨石组成的影响。通过利用罗塞塔对彗星67P / Churyumov-Gerasimenko中的耐火性有机物的测量，我们发现根据目前广泛采用的太阳丰度，它们将占据KBO形成区域中前太阳C库存的很大一部分。然而，这将释放出太多的氧来形成水冰，产生的固体物质不够富含岩石，无法解释冥王星-卡戎系统和其他大型KBOs的未压缩密度；前者被认为是我们对大型KBOs的整体组成最具代表性的值。这种不一致进一步凸显了太阳丰度问题 - 在调和光谱测定的重元素丰度与太阳强度约束之间存在的挑战。通过使用来自太阳CNO中微子和太阳风测量的新数据集，我们展示了冥王星-卡戎系统的未压缩密度可以在各种情况下得到复制。我们发现龙宫和奔努样本中缺少硫酸盐意味着最初聚集到CI球粒陨石母体中的水冰量比以前认为的要少。这些数据与新数据集所暗示的太阳C / O比一致。我们的预测可以通过未来的中微子，太阳地震学和宇宙化学测量来进行验证。 <div>
We examine the role of refractory organics as a major C carrier in the outer protosolar nebula and its implications for the compositions of large Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) and CI chondrites. By utilizing Rosetta measurements of refractory organics in comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, we show that they would make up a large fraction of the protosolar C inventory in the KBO-forming region based on the current widely adopted solar abundances. However, this would free up too much O to form water ice, producing solid material that is not sufficiently rock-rich to explain the uncompressed density of the Pluto–Charon system and other large KBOs; the former has been argued as the most representative value we have for the bulk composition of large KBOs. This inconsistency further highlights the solar abundances problem—an ongoing challenge in reconciling spectroscopically determined heavy-element abundances with helioseismology constraints. By employing a new data set from solar CNO neutrinos and solar wind measurements of C, N, and O, we show that the uncompressed density of the Pluto–Charon system can be reproduced over a wide range of scenarios. We show that a lack of sulfates in Ryugu and Bennu samples implies a lower amount of water ice initially accreted into CI chondrite parent bodies than previously thought. These data are found to be consistent with the solar C/O ratio implied by the new data set. Our predictions can be tested by future neutrino, helioseismology, and cosmochemical measurements.

该研究发现，早期宇宙中的星系似乎以比预期更快的速度成长和组装成大规模星系。这与ΛCDM结构形成范式的预期不符。现有的光度数据表明，在z≳10时期形成了一群大质量星系，并在短时间内（≲1 Gyr）迅速停止形成新星，符合传统的巨型椭圆星系演化模型。类似地，动力学观测显示，在早期已经存在大质量螺旋星系及其尺度关系。解释大规模星系的早期形成需要在z>10时期出现极高效率的重子转化成恒星，或者比ΛCDM预期的更快速的重子组装。后一种可能性正是修正牛顿动力学（MOND）提前明确预测的。我们还讨论了MOND的一些进一步预测，如星系团的早期形成和早期再电离。<br /><br />总结: 该研究发现早期宇宙中的大规模星系形成速度比预期更快，与传统模型不符。其中一种可能性是修正牛顿动力学提前预测的，还讨论了修正牛顿动力学的一些进一步预测。 <div>
Galaxies in the early Universe appear to have grown too big too fast, assembling into massive, monolithic objects more rapidly than anticipated in the hierarchical Lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM) structure formation paradigm. The available photometric data are consistent with there being a population of massive galaxies that form early (z ≳ 10) and quench rapidly over a short (≲1 Gyr) timescale, consistent with the traditional picture for the evolution of giant elliptical galaxies. Similarly, kinematic observations as a function of redshift show that massive spirals and their scaling relations were in place at early times. Explaining the early emergence of massive galaxies requires either an extremely efficient conversion of baryons into stars at z > 10 or a more rapid assembly of baryons than anticipated in ΛCDM. The latter possibility was explicitly predicted in advance by modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). We discuss some further predictions of MOND, such as the early emergence of clusters of galaxies and early reionization.

总结: 
生命在地球上的独特生物标志是有机化合物的手性选择性。本文提出了磁性对齐尘埃颗粒可能是自旋极化电子来源，这些电子通过巴耐特效应被光电发射出来。这些自旋极化电子可能对星际尘埃颗粒上的手性分子产生非对称的影响。通过研究发现，这一机制可能解释了在众多彗星、小行星和陨石中检测到的生命前分子的手性不对称性。同时，在尘埃颗粒和气体中，电子自旋的磁性对齐效应在电子的运动过程中可能是可以忽略的。 <div>
The unique biosignature of life on Earth is the homochirality of organic compounds, such as amino acids, proteins, and sugars. High-energy spin-polarized (spinup or spindown) electrons (SPEs) from the β decay of radioactive nuclei have been proposed as a source of symmetry breaking, leading to homochirality; however, their exact role is much debated. Here, we propose magnetically aligned dust grains as a new source of SPEs, due to the photoemission of electrons having aligned spins by the Barnett effect. For the interstellar UV radiation field of strength GUV, we find that the SPE emission rate is electrons per second per H, the fraction of spin-polarized to total photoelectrons is ∼10%, and the SPE yield (photoelectron number per UV photon) can reach ∼1%, using the modern theory of grain alignment. SPEs emitted from aligned grains could play an important role in chiral-induced spin-selectivity-driven reduction chemistry in the icy grain mantles, producing an enantiomer excess of chiral molecules formed on the grain mantle. Finally, we suggest magnetically aligned grains could directly impact the enantio-selectivity through the chiral-induced spin-selective adsorption effect and exchange interaction. We estimate the disalignment of electron spins and depolarization by elastic scattering using the Mott theory and find that these effects are negligible for low-energy SPEs, so that the spins of SPEs remain well aligned during their journey through dust grains and the gas. Our proposed mechanism might explain the chiral asymmetry of prebiotic molecules detected in numerous comets, asteroids, and meteorites.

总结:<br />
本研究使用Hubble Space Telescope观测了171个大质量后爆发星系的图像，并进行了结构拟合分析。研究发现，这些后爆发星系比普通静止星系更紧凑，但其核心表面质量密度与静止星系相似。这些后爆发星系呈现圆形投影，主要是3D中的球状体，而不是盘状星系。此外，研究表明后爆发星系的大小或中心密度与熄灭时间间隔之间不存在相关性，这排除了由于星暴消退导致的结构增长。相反，研究推测这些大质量星系的快速熄灭更倾向于发生在具有预先紧凑结构的星系中。 <div>
Poststarburst galaxies (PSBs) are young quiescent galaxies that have recently experienced a rapid decrease in star formation, allowing us to probe the fast-quenching period of galaxy evolution. In this work, we obtained Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/WFC3 F110W imaging to measure the sizes of 171 massive ( spectroscopically identified PSBs at 1 < z 1.3 selected from the DESI Survey Validation luminous red galaxy sample. This statistical sample constitutes an order of magnitude increase from the ∼20 PSBs with space-based imaging and deep spectroscopy. We perform structural fitting of the target galaxies with pysersic and compare them to quiescent and star-forming galaxies in the 3D-HST survey. We find that these PSBs are more compact than the general population of quiescent galaxies, lying systematically ∼0.1 dex below the established size–mass relation. However, their central surface mass densities are similar to those of their quiescent counterparts ( ). These findings are easily reconciled by later ex situ growth via minor mergers or a slight progenitor bias. These PSBs are round in projection (b/amedian ∼ 0.8), suggesting that they are primarily spheroids, not disks, in 3D. We find no correlation between the time since quenching and light-weighted PSB sizes or central densities. This disfavors apparent structural growth due to the fading of centralized starbursts in this galaxy population. Instead, we posit that the fast quenching of massive galaxies at this epoch occurs preferentially in galaxies with preexisting compact structures.

Ultrahot Jupiters (UHJs), being the hottest class of exoplanets known, provide a unique laboratory for testing atmospheric interactions with internal planetary magnetic fields at a large range of temperatures. Thermal ionization of atmospheric species on the dayside of these planets results in charged particles becoming embedded in the planet’s mostly neutral wind. The charges will resist flow across magnetic field lines as they are dragged around the planet and ultimately alter the circulation pattern of the atmosphere. We model this process to study this effect on high-resolution emission and transmission spectra in order to identify observational signatures of the magnetic circulation regime that exist across multiple UHJs. Using a state-of-the-art kinematic MHD/active drag approach in a 3D atmospheric model, we simulate three different UHJs with and without magnetic effects. We postprocess these models to generate high-resolution emission and transmission spectra and explore trends in the net Doppler shift as a function of phase. In emission spectra, we find that the net Doppler shift before and after secondary eclipse can be influenced by the presence of magnetic drag and the wavelength choice. Trends in transmission spectra show our active drag models consistently produce a unique shape in their Doppler shift trends that differs from the models without active drag. This work is a critical theoretical step to understanding how magnetic fields shape the atmospheres of UHJs and provides some of the first predictions in high-resolution spectroscopy for observing these effects.

We investigate the multiphase structure of gas flows in galaxies. We study 80 galaxies during the epoch of peak star formation (1.4 ≤ z ≤ 2.7) using data from the Keck/Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) and the Very Large Telescope/K-Band Multi-Object Spectrograph (KMOS). Our analysis provides a simultaneous probe of outflows using UV emission and absorption features and Hα emission. With this unprecedented data set, we examine the properties of gas flows estimated from LRIS and KMOS in relation to other galaxy properties, such as star formation rate (SFR), SFR surface density (ΣSFR), stellar mass (M*), and main-sequence offset (ΔMS). We find no strong correlations between outflow velocity measured from rest-UV line centroids and galaxy properties. However, we find that galaxies with detected outflows show higher averages in SFR, ΣSFR, and ΔMS than those lacking outflow detections, indicating a connection between outflow and galaxy properties. Furthermore, we find a lower average outflow velocity than previously reported, suggesting greater absorption at the systemic redshift of the galaxy. Finally, we detect outflows in 49% of our LRIS sample and 30% in the KMOS sample and find no significant correlation between outflow detection and inclination. These results may indicate that outflows are not collimated and that Hα outflows have a lower covering fraction than low-ionization interstellar absorption lines. Additionally, these tracers may be sensitive to different physical scales of outflow activity. A larger sample size with a wider dynamic range in galaxy properties is needed to further test this picture.

The accretion/ejection processes in T Tauri stars are fundamental to their physical evolution, while also impacting the properties and evolution of the circumstellar material at a time when planet formation takes place. To date, the characterization of ongoing accretion processes in stellar pairs at 5–50 au scales has been challenging as high-angular resolution spectrographs are required to extract the spectral features of each component. We present the analysis of spectroscopic observations of the tight (160 mas, 25 au) T Tauri system HT Lup A/B, obtained with MUSE at the Very Large Telescope in 2021 March and July. We focus on constraining the accretion/ejection processes and variability of the secondary component HT Lup B by searching for accretion tracers by applying high-resolution spectral differential imaging techniques. We retrieve strong (signal-to-noise ratio > 5) Hα, Hβ, and [O i]λ6300 emission in both epochs. The Hα and Hβ line fluxes showcase high variability, with variations up to 200%–300% between epochs. The fluxes are consistent with accretion rates of 3× 10−9M⊙ yr−1 and 8 × 10−10M⊙ yr−1 for the first and second epochs, respectively. We attribute the increased accretion activity during the first night to a “burst-like” event, followed by a relaxation period more representative of the common accretion activity of the system. The [O i]λ6300 line profiles remain relatively similar between epochs and suggest ejection rates on the order of 10−9−10−10M⊙ yr−1, compatible with moderate disk wind emission. Our results also indicate that the accretion processes of HT Lup B are compatible with Classical T Tauri stars, unlike previous classifications.

We incorporate the thermal Doppler mechanism and microturbulence velocity. Pressure-broadening effects on molecular transitions, leading to Lorentzian or Voigt profiles, are explored in the context of atmospheric profiles for exoplanets, brown dwarfs, and low-mass stars. We also delve into the impact of electron degeneracy and nonideal effects, such as ionization potential depression under high-density conditions, emphasizing its notable influence on Rosseland mean opacities at temperatures exceeding 10,000 K. As a result, this study expands the ÆSOPUS public web interface for customized gas chemical mixtures, promoting flexibility in opacity calculations based on specific research needs. Additionally, precomputed opacity tables, inclusive of condensates, are provided. We present a preliminary application to evolutionary models for very low-mass stars.

<div> MAXI J1813−095, hard state, relativistic iron line, truncated disk, reflection fraction

总结:
MAXI J1813−095在2018年的硬态“停滞”爆发期间进行了自洽分析，使用了NICER、Swift、Chandra和NuSTAR进行了七次观测。研究发现了来自星体吸积盘内部区域的约6.5keV的相对论性铁线。结果表明，内半径约为2Rg，最小自旋值为>0.7，最佳值约为0.9，假设在Lx∼1%LEdd时Rin达到最内稳定圆轨道。研究还运用了耦合种子盘光子到复合反射的谱模型分析MAXI J1813−095的爆发过程，这是本研究的独特之处。其他关键参数（如倾斜度和内半径）与其他研究结果一致。反射比为1的结果明显高于先前的研究，这是应用自洽盘-复合-反射光谱模型的结果。 <div>
We present our analysis of MAXI J1813−095 during its hard state “stalled” outburst in 2018. This self-consistent analysis has been carried out using the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer, Swift, Chandra, and NuSTAR throughout seven observations of MAXI J1813−095. We find a relativistic iron line at ∼6.5 keV from the inner region of the accretion disk. Our results are consistent with a slightly truncated disk or nontruncated disk for an inner radius of ∼2Rg and minimum spin of >0.7 with the best value of ∼0.9, assuming Rin reaches the innermost stable circular orbit at Lx ∼ 1% LEdd. We analyzed MAXI J1813−095 over its outburst, employing a spectral model that self-consistently couples the seed disk photons to the Comptonization and reflection components, also inclusive of reflection Comptonization. The unique aspect of this work is a reflection fraction of order unity, which is significantly higher than previous studies of this source and is a consequence of applying the self-consistent disk-Comptonization-reflection spectral model. Other key parameters, such as inclination and inner radius, are found to be consistent with other works.

研究团队对矮椭圆星系的暗物质晕进行了分析，并讨论了宇宙学和演化方面的影响。他们通过轨道建模，获得了密度斜率和球化程度，并发现“锥心-核心”矛盾较小。矮椭圆星系的暗物质晕中心斜率略低于理论预测，但测量得到的球化程度仍比宇宙学模拟预测的更加圆形。与更明亮的早期星系不同，矮椭圆星系的总密度斜率较浅，且其暗物质密度与亮度的关系不符合预期。矮椭圆星系的暗物质密度和斜率与环境和角动量密切相关。此外，研究结果还表明，矮椭圆星系的晕具有一定的不确定性，且只受到内部反馈的轻微影响。总的来说，矮椭圆星系在局部宇宙组装的红移较高，星系的形成和暗物质晕的组装有很大差异，这表明目前不会有新的矮椭圆星系形成。 <br /><br />总结: 暗物质晕的密度斜率略低于理论预测，矮椭圆星系的球化程度较宇宙学模拟预测的更加圆形；矮椭圆星系的暗物质密度与亮度的关系不符合预期；矮椭圆星系的暗物质密度和斜率与环境和角动量密切相关；矮椭圆星系的暗物质晕受到内部反馈的轻微影响；矮椭圆星系在局部宇宙组装的红移较高，星系的形成和暗物质晕的组装有很大差异。 <div>
We analyze the dark matter (DM) halos of a sample of dwarf ellipticals (dEs) and discuss cosmological and evolutionary implications. Using orbit modeling, we recover their density slopes and, for the first time, halo flattening. We find that the “cusp-core” tension is mild; on average, dEs have central slopes slightly below the Navarro–Frenk–White predictions. However, the measured flattenings are still more spherical than cosmological simulations predict. Unlike brighter early-type galaxies, the total density slopes of dEs are shallower, and their average DM density does not follow their scaling relation with luminosity. Conversely, dE halos are denser and the densities steeper than in late-type galaxies. We find average DM density and slope are strongly correlated with the environment and moderately with the angular momentum. Central, nonrotating dEs have dense and cuspy halos, whereas rotating dEs in Virgo’s outskirts are more cored and less dense. This can be explained by a delayed formation of the dEs in the cluster outskirts, or alternatively by the accumulated baryonic feedback that the dEs in the outskirts have experienced during their very different star formation history. Our results suggest halo profiles are not universal (they depend on assembly conditions) and they evolve only mildly due to internal feedback. We conclude dEs in the local Universe have assembled at a higher redshift than local spirals. In these extreme conditions, star formation and halo assembly, for example, were very different, suggesting no new dEs are formed at present.

<div> dEs, Virgo cluster, kinematic moments, star formation, stellar structure
总结: 
该研究分析了居住在维珍星系团中不同环境中的矮椭圆星系（dEs）的恒星结构。研究利用高光谱分辨率的积分场观测，确定了它们的低速度离散度（约25 km s−1）和半光半径处更高阶的动力学时刻。研究发现，dEs在年龄上表现出多样性，年轻的dEs的金属丰度比年老的低，这表明最近进入维珍星系团的dEs的恒星形成历史复杂，而另一些星系在复电离后不久就被抑制了恒星形成。轨道叠加建模允许恢复视角、恒星质量-光度比（带梯度）以及固有轨道结构。研究发现，与普通早期星系相比，dEs的角动量受到强烈抑制，并且与环境相关。扁平的dEs是因为其垂直于赤道面的动能被抑制。结合人口和动力学建模结果，我们发现了一个年龄相关的恒星初始质量函数，或者证据表明对于那些初始质量较高和/或居住在较低密度环境中的星系，它们的星形成历史更加延续。dEs似乎具有空间均匀的恒星结构，但它们停止形成恒星时所处的状态根据其初始条件在很大程度上会发生显著变化。<br /><br /> <div>
We analyze the stellar structure of a sample of dwarf ellipticals (dEs) inhabiting various environments within the Virgo cluster. Integral-field observations with a high spectral resolution allow us to robustly determine their low-velocity dispersions (∼25 km s−1) and higher-order kinematic moments out to the half-light radius. We find the dEs exhibit a diversity in ages, with the younger dEs being less enhanced than the older, suggesting a complex star formation history for those dEs that recently entered Virgo, while others have been quenched shortly after reionization. Orbit-superposition modeling allowed us to recover viewing angles, stellar mass-to-light ratios (with gradients), as well as the intrinsic orbit structure. We find that the angular momentum of the dEs is strongly suppressed compared to ordinary early-type galaxies and correlates with the environment. Flattened dEs are so because of a suppressed kinetic energy perpendicular to their equatorial plane. Combining population and dynamical modeling results, we find an age-dependent stellar initial mass function or, alternatively, evidence for a more extended star formation history for those galaxies that have had higher initial mass and/or inhabited lower-density environments. dEs appear to have a spatially homogeneous stellar structure, but the state they were “frozen” in as they stopped forming stars varies dramatically according to their initial conditions.

<div> TDE, AT2022lri, X-ray data, super-Eddington accretion flow, ionized outflows
<br /><br />总结:
本文报告了TDE事件AT2022lri，该事件发生在一个距离我们约144Mpc的一颗低质量的大质量黑洞（104M⊙ < MBH < 106M⊙）的准静态星系中。通过NICER，Swift和XMM-Newton收集了超过1Ms的X射线数据，发现X射线的亮度从峰值187到672天之间逐渐下降，但仍远高于紫外线和光学亮度，与正面观察到的超艾丁顿吸积流一致。还观察到不规则的强X射线波动，变化时间尺度约为0.5小时至1天，振幅约为2-8。在对时间分辨光谱进行分析后，显示X射线波动与内部盘温度的下降相关，并需要次相对论（0.1-0.3c）的离子外流存在。研究者提出，盘温度波动可能源于磁不稳定性或内部吸积盘沿着黑洞自旋轴的摇摆。 <div>
We present the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2022lri, hosted in a nearby (≈144 Mpc) quiescent galaxy with a low-mass massive black hole (104M⊙ < MBH < 106M⊙). AT2022lri belongs to the TDE-H+He subtype. More than 1 Ms of X-ray data were collected with NICER, Swift, and XMM-Newton from 187 to 672 days after peak. The X-ray luminosity gradually declined from 1.5 × 1044 erg s−1 to 1.5 × 1043 erg s−1 and remains much above the UV and optical luminosity, consistent with a super-Eddington accretion flow viewed face-on. Sporadic strong X-ray dips atop a long-term decline are observed, with a variability timescale of ≈0.5 hr–1 days and amplitude of ≈2–8. When fitted with simple continuum models, the X-ray spectrum is dominated by a thermal disk component with inner temperature going from ∼146 to ∼86 eV. However, there are residual features that peak around 1 keV, which, in some cases, cannot be reproduced by a single broad emission line. We analyzed a subset of time-resolved spectra with two physically motivated models describing a scenario either where ionized absorbers contribute extra absorption and emission lines or where disk reflection plays an important role. Both models provide good and statistically comparable fits, show that the X-ray dips are correlated with drops in the inner disk temperature, and require the existence of subrelativistic (0.1–0.3c) ionized outflows. We propose that the disk temperature fluctuation stems from episodic drops of the mass accretion rate triggered by magnetic instabilities or/and wobbling of the inner accretion disk along the black hole’s spin axis.

The James Webb Space Telescope opens a new window to directly probe luminous quasars powered by billion solar mass black holes in the Epoch of Reionization and their coevolution with massive galaxies with unprecedented details. In this paper, we report the first results from a deep NIRSpec integral field unit spectroscopic study of a quasar at z = 7.5. We obtain a bolometric luminosity of ∼1.8 × 1047 erg s−1 and a black hole mass of ∼0.7–2.5 × 109M⊙ based on the Hβ emission line in the quasar spectrum. We discover ∼2 kpc scale, highly blueshifted (∼−870 km s−1) and broad (∼1400 km s−1) [O iii] line emission after the quasar point-spread function has been subtracted. Such line emission most likely originates from a fast, quasar-driven outflow, the earliest one at galactic scales known so far. The dynamical properties of this outflow fall within the typical ranges of quasar-driven outflows at lower redshift, and the outflow may be fast enough to reach the circumgalactic medium. Combining both the extended and nuclear outflow together, the mass outflow rate, ∼300 M⊙ yr−1, is ∼60%–380% of the star formation rate of the quasar host galaxy, suggesting that the outflow may expel a significant amount of gas from the inner region of the galaxy. The kinetic energy outflow rate, ∼3.6 × 1044 erg s−1, is ∼0.2% of the quasar bolometric luminosity, which is comparable to the minimum value required for negative feedback based on simulation predictions. The dynamical timescale of the extended outflow is ∼1.7 Myr, consistent with the typical quasar lifetime in this era.

Gravitational-wave (GW) detectors are observing compact object mergers from increasingly far distances, revealing the redshift evolution of the binary black hole (BBH)—and soon the black hole–neutron star (BHNS) and binary neutron star (BNS)—merger rate. To help interpret these observations, we investigate the expected redshift evolution of the compact object merger rate from the isolated binary evolution channel. We present a publicly available catalog of compact object mergers and their accompanying cosmological merger rates from population synthesis simulations conducted with the COMPAS software. To explore the impact of uncertainties in stellar and binary evolution, our simulations use two-parameter grids of binary evolution models that vary the common-envelope efficiency with mass transfer accretion efficiency and supernova (SN) remnant mass prescription with SN natal kick velocity, respectively. We quantify the redshift evolution of our simulated merger rates using the local (z ∼ 0) rate, the redshift at which the merger rate peaks, and the normalized differential rates (as a proxy for slope). We find that although the local rates span a range of ∼103 across our model variations, their redshift evolutions are remarkably similar for BBHs, BHNSs, and BNSs, with differentials typically within a factor 3 and peaks of z ≈ 1.2–2.4 across models. Furthermore, several trends in our simulated rates are correlated with the model parameters we explore. We conclude that future observations of the redshift evolution of the compact object merger rate can help constrain binary models for stellar evolution and GW formation channels.

Narrow emission lines in a galaxy’s spectrum that show double peaks indicate the presence of distinct gas components with different velocities, and its physical origin remains uncertain. This study uses galaxies from the final MaNGA data release to detect double-peaked narrow emission-line spaxels (DPSs) by examining the double Gaussian profiles of the Hα-[N ii] doublets across all MaNGA spaxels. A total of 5420 DPSs associated with 304 double-peaked narrow emission-line galaxies (DPGs) are identified, with each DPG containing a minimum of five DPSs and being free from overlap with other galaxies. We find that DPSs can be categorized into three groups according to their central distance r/Re and the velocity difference Δv between their two components: the inner low-Δv, inner high-Δv, and outer DPSs. By incorporating the physical characteristics of the DPGs into their DPSs, we demonstrate for the first time the existence of statistical correlations between barred DPGs and inner low-Δv DPSs, AGN-hosting DPGs, and inner high-Δv DPSs, as well as tidal DPGs and outer DPSs.

We investigate the connection between galaxies, dark matter halos, and their large-scale environments at z = 0 with Illustris TNG300 hydrodynamic simulation data. We predict stellar masses from subhalo properties to test two types of machine learning (ML) models: explainable boosting machines (EBMs) with simple galaxy environment features and -invariant graph neural networks (GNNs). The best-performing EBM models leverage spherically averaged overdensity features on 3 Mpc scales. Interpretations via SHapley Additive exPlanations also suggest that in the context of the TNG300 galaxy–halo connection, simple spherical overdensity on ∼3 Mpc scales is more important than cosmic web distance features measured using the DisPerSE algorithm. Meanwhile, a GNN with connectivity defined by a fixed linking length, L, outperforms the EBM models by a significant margin. As we increase the linking length scale, GNNs learn important environmental contributions up to the largest scales we probe (L = 10 Mpc). We conclude that 3 Mpc distance scales are most critical for describing the TNG galaxy–halo connection using the spherical overdensity parameterization, but that information on larger scales, which is not captured by simple environmental parameters or cosmic web features, can further augment these models. Our study highlights the benefits of using interpretable ML algorithms to explain models of astrophysical phenomena, and the power of using GNNs to flexibly learn complex relationships directly from data while imposing constraints from physical symmetries.

本文研究了GW170817A双中子星合并事件的电磁辐射和余辉观测，确认了该合并事件与一个狭窄而强大的喷流相关联。研究利用了协同中子星磁流体动力学模拟和半解析估计，注入了一个狭窄而强大的非磁化喷流。研究探讨了不同的开角、光度、中心引擎持续时间和合并后时间。发现半解析估计正确预测了喷流的爆发和聚束条件。通过将合成余辉光曲线与观测到的射电数据进行比较，发现3 × 10^49 erg的喷流在合并后晚期发射，并且开角在约5°-7°的范围内能与观测数据相符。 <div>
The electromagnetic emission and the afterglow observations of the binary neutron star merger event GW170817A confirmed the association of the merger with a short gamma-ray burst (GRB) harboring a narrow (5°–10°) and powerful (1049–1050 erg) jet. Using the 1 s long neutrino-radiation general relativistic MHD simulation of coalescing neutron stars of K. Kiuchi et al., and following the semi-analytical estimates of M. Pais et al., we inject a narrow, powerful, unmagnetized jet into the post-merger phase. We explore different opening angles, luminosities, central engine durations, and times after the merger. We explore early (0.1 s following the merger) and late (1 s) jet launches; the latter is consistent with the time delay of ≈1.74 s observed between GW170817 and GRB 170817A. We demonstrate that the semi-analytical estimates correctly predict the jets’ breakout and collimation conditions. When comparing our synthetic afterglow light curves to the observed radio data of GW170807, we find a good agreement for a 3 × 1049 erg jet launched late with an opening angle in the range ≃5°–7°.

X-rays have significant impacts on cold, weakly ionized protoplanetary disks by increasing the ionization rate and driving chemical reactions. Stellar flares are explosions that emit intense X-rays and are the unique source of hard X-rays with an energy of ≳10 keV in the protoplanetary disk systems. Hard X-rays should be carefully taken into account in models as they can reach the disk midplane as a result of scattering in the disk atmospheres. However, previous models are insufficient to predict the hard X-ray spectra because of simplifications in flare models. We develop a model of X-ray spectra of stellar flares based on observations and flare theories. The flare temperature and nonthermal electron emissions are modeled as functions of flare energy, which allows us to better predict the hard X-ray photon flux than before. Using our X-ray model, we conduct radiative transfer calculations to investigate the impact of flare hard X-rays on disk ionization, with a particular focus on the protoplanetary disk around a T Tauri star. We demonstrate that for a flare with an energy of 1035 erg, X-ray photons with ≳5 keV increase the ionization rates more than galactic cosmic rays down to z ≈ 0.1R. The contribution of flare X-rays to the ionization at the midplane depends on the disk parameters such as disk mass and dust settling. We also find that the 10 yr averaged X-rays from multiple flares could certainly contribute to the ionization. These results emphasize the importance of stellar flares on the disk evolution.

本研究使用COMPAS进行了群体综合模拟，发现孤立双黑洞、黑洞-中子星和双中子星合并率与尺度SFRD存在显著偏差。这种偏差主要是由于低金属丰度条件下形成双黑洞的效率比太阳金属丰度条件下高一个数量级，以及双黑洞形成和合并之间存在着广泛的延迟时间。此外，我们还发现双黑洞的延迟时间分布随红移变化，增加了合并时的红移分布的复杂性。这些结果表明来自孤立渠道的双黑洞、黑洞-中子星和双中子星合并率可能明显偏离尺度SFRD，未来的合并率测量将对引力波源的形成途径提供进一步洞察。 <div>
Gravitational-wave detectors are now making it possible to investigate how the merger rate of binary black holes (BBHs) evolves with redshift. In this study, we examine whether the BBH merger rate of isolated binaries deviates from a scaled star formation rate density (SFRD)—a frequently used model in state-of-the-art research. To address this question, we conduct population synthesis simulations using COMPAS with a grid of stellar evolution models, calculate their cosmological merger rates, and compare them to a scaled SFRD. We find that our simulated rates deviate by factors up to 3.5 at z ∼ 0 and 5 at z ∼ 9 due to two main phenomena: (i) the formation efficiency of BBHs is an order of magnitude higher at low metallicities than at solar metallicity, and (ii) BBHs experience a wide range of delays (from a few megayears to many gigayears) between formation and merger. The deviations are similar when comparing to a delayed SFRD, and even larger (up to ∼10×) when comparing to SFRD-based models scaled to the local merger rate. Interestingly, our simulations find that the BBH delay time distribution is redshift dependent, increasing the complexity of the redshift distribution of mergers. We find similar results for simulated merger rates of black hole–neutron stars (BHNSs) and binary neutron stars (BNSs). We conclude that the rate of BBH, BHNS, and BNS mergers from the isolated channel can significantly deviate from a scaled SFRD, and that future measurements of the merger rate will provide insights into the formation pathways of gravitational-wave sources.

<div> LISA, gravitational waves, intermediate-mass black holes, dwarf galaxies, N-body simulations
总结: 这篇文章讨论了中等质量黑洞（IMBH）在侏儒星系中的动力学和演化。研究发现，在非核心侏儒星系中，IMBH之间的融合速度较慢，尽管具有极高的偏心率。这表明在非核心侏儒星系中，低密度的星际环境不足以推动IMBH二进制系统融合。这些发现强调了需要考虑宿主特性才能准确预测LISA所观测到的IMBH融合速率。 <div>
Intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) mergers with masses 104–106M⊙ are expected to produce gravitational waves detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) with high signal-to-noise ratios from the present day to cosmic dawn. IMBH mergers are expected to take place within dwarf galaxies; however, the dynamics, timescales, and effect on their hosts are largely unexplored. In a previous study, we examined how IMBHs would pair and merge within nucleated dwarf galaxies. IMBHs in nucleated hosts evolve very efficiently, forming a binary system and coalescing within a few hundred million years. Although the fraction of dwarf galaxies (107M⊙ ≤ M⋆ ≤ 1010M⊙) hosting nuclear star clusters is between 60% and 100%, this fraction drops to 20%–70% for lower-mass dwarfs (M⋆ ≈ 107M⊙), with the largest drop in low-density environments. Here, we extend our previous study by performing direct N-body simulations to explore the dynamics and evolution of IMBHs within nonnucleated dwarf galaxies, under the assumption that IMBHs exist within these dwarfs. To our surprise, none of the IMBHs in our simulation suite merge within a Hubble time, despite many attaining high eccentricities e ∼ 0.7–0.95. We conclude that extremely low stellar density environments in the centers of nonnucleated dwarfs do not provide an ample supply of stars to interact with an IMBH binary, resulting in its stalling, in spite of triaxiality and high eccentricity, common means to drive a binary to coalescence. Our findings underline the importance of considering all detailed host properties to predict IMBH merger rates for LISA.

总结: 通过使用非局部热力学平衡反演和瑞典反演码，研究了太阳色球区域的声波能量通量和辐射损失之间的平衡。利用干涉双向光谱仪和接触区域成像光谱仪的光谱观测数据，自洽地推导了大气不同高度处的速度功率谱和冷却速率。研究结果表明，在拟合这些光谱线时，反演可能低估了色球各个高度处的声波通量，同时略微高估了辐射损失。然而，即使考虑了这些偏差，声波通量与辐射损失的比值在大多数观测区域仍然低于1，特别是在色球的较高层。此外，我们还观察到在斑区，磁场倾斜角与低色球的辐射损失之间存在相关性，这表明磁场拓扑在色球损失中起着一定作用。 <div>
Accurately assessing the balance between acoustic wave energy fluxes and radiative losses is critical for understanding how the solar chromosphere is thermally regulated. We investigate the energy balance in the chromosphere by comparing deposited acoustic flux and radiative losses under quiet and active solar conditions using non–local thermodynamic equilibrium inversions with the Stockholm Inversion Code. To achieve this, we utilize spectroscopic observations from the Interferometric BIdimensional Spectrometer in the Na i 5896 Å and Ca ii 8542 Å lines and from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph in the Mg ii h and k lines to self-consistently derive spatially resolved velocity power spectra and cooling rates across different heights in the atmosphere. Additionally, we use snapshots of a three-dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamics simulation to investigate the systematic effects of the inversion approach, particularly the effect of attenuation on the velocity power spectra and the determination of the cooling rates. The results indicate that inversions potentially underestimate acoustic fluxes at all chromospheric heights while slightly overestimating the radiative losses when fitting these spectral lines. However, even after accounting for these biases, the ratio of acoustic flux to radiative losses remains below unity in most observed regions, particularly in the higher layers of the chromosphere. We also observe a correlation between the magnetic field inclination in the photosphere and radiative losses in the low chromosphere in plage, which is evidence that the field topology plays a role in the chromospheric losses.

Data from the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) are analyzed from 1996 to 2023 to investigate tilt angles (γ) of bipolar magnetic regions and Joy’s law for Solar Cycles 23 and 24 and a portion of Cycle 25. The HMI radial magnetic field (Br) and MDI magnetogram (Blos) data are used to calculate (γ) using the flux-weighted centroids of the positive and negative polarities. Each active region (AR) is only sampled once. The analysis includes only Beta (β)-class ARs since computing γ of complex ARs is less meaningful. During the emergence of the ARs, we find that the average tilt angle ( ) increases from 3.°30 ± 0.75 when 20% of the flux has emerged to 6.°79° ± 0.66 when the ARs are at their maximum flux. Cycle 24 has a larger average tilt, =6.67 ± 0.66, than Cycle 23, = 5.11 ± 0.61. No significant difference is found in the slope of Joy’s law or when sampling the ARs at the time of maximum flux or central meridian crossing. There are persistent differences in in the hemispheres, with the Sun's southern hemisphere having higher in Cycles 23 and 24, but the uncertainties are such that these differences are not statistically significant.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章采用两点相关函数作为统计工具，对IllustrisTNG模拟中不同宇宙红移下不同宿主暗物质晕体积质量范围内星系的空间聚类进行了量化。研究发现，空间聚类强度与星系形成红移之间存在明显相关性，且随着宿主暗物质晕质量的增加而减弱。对于更庞大的星系系统，它们在较晚的时间进行组装，新加入的恒星会增加聚类现象。此外，更庞大暗物质晕中的卫星星系轨道表现出更大的径向各向异性，反映了其宿主暗物质晕更活跃的吞并状态以及更高的质量损失速率。 <div>
We adopt the two-point correlation function (2PCF) as a statistical tool to quantify the spatial clustering of halo stars for galaxy systems spanning a wide range in host halo virial mass ( ) and redshifts (0 < z < 1.5) from the IllustrisTNG simulations. Consistent with a previous study, we identify clear correlations between the strength of the 2PCF signals and galaxy formation redshifts, but over a much wider mass range. We find that such correlations are slightly stronger at higher redshifts and get weakened with the increase of host halo mass. We demonstrate that the spatial clustering of halo stars is affected by two factors: (1) the clustering gets gradually weakened as time passes (phase mixing); (2) newly accreted stars at more recent times would increase the clustering. For more massive galaxy systems, they assemble late, and the newly accreted stars would increase the clustering. The late assembly of massive systems may also help to explain the weaker correlations between the 2PCF signals and the galaxy formation redshifts in massive halos, as their 2PCFs are affected more by recently accreted stars, while formation redshift characterizes mass accretion on a much longer timescale. We find that the orbits of satellite galaxies in more massive halos maintain larger radial anisotropy, reflecting the more active accretion state of their hosts while also contributing to their stronger mass loss rates.

太阳活跃区NOAA Active Region 11861的耀斑活动的观测结果显示，在接口区成像光谱仪（IRIS）的远紫外通道中可以观测到分子氢（H2）的丰富光谱发射线。通过比较使用1D建模的H2荧光产生的合成光谱，确定了37条新的发射线。为了避免误认H2线，还从先前研究中编制了IRIS FUV波段的完整原子线鉴定清单。我们对耀斑期间发生的H2发射进行了空间分辨分析，得出了以下结论：（1）在空间分辨观测中，H2线比可能显示出光学厚线形成，与先前的结果相反；（2）H2多普勒速度的空间分布与从其他物种测量的速度相比，表明H2远程探测探测了大气的中间深度，介于光球和色球之间，与建模的预期一致；（3）H2线强度与其激发源的观测强度之间的关系与大气成层有关；（4）H2荧光有时会对来自太阳表面许多兆米之外的远源辐射作出反应。

A rich spectrum of molecular hydrogen (H2) emission lines is seen in sensitive observations from the far-ultraviolet (FUV) channels of the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) during flare activity in solar active region NOAA Active Region 11861. Based on this observation, we have determined 37 new line identifications by comparing synthetic spectra produced using 1D modeling of H2 fluorescence. To avoid misidentification of the H2 lines, we have also compiled a complete list of atomic line identifications for the IRIS FUV bandpasses from previous work. We carry out analysis of the spatially resolved H2 emission that occurs during the flares and find the following: (1) in spatially resolved observations the H2 line ratios may show optically thick line formation, contrary to previous results; (2) comparison of the spatial distribution of H2 Doppler velocities with those measured from other species reveals that H2 remote sensing probes an intermediate depth in the atmosphere between the photosphere and chromosphere, consistent with expectations from modeling; (3) the relationship between H2 line intensity and the observed intensity of its exciter is related to the atmospheric stratification; however, (4) H2 fluorescence can sometimes occur in response to radiation from distant sources many megameters away across the solar surface.

Sub-ion-scale magnetic holes (MHs) are ubiquitous structures in plasmas across a wide range of environments. Despite previous observational and modeling efforts, the three-dimensional (3D) electric field in MHs has yet to be adequately resolved. In this study, utilizing high-resolution measurements of an MH (∼0.08ρi × 0.14ρi) from the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission in Earth’s turbulent magnetosheath, we report this 3D electric field and unveil its roles and generation mechanism. A model is established to quantify the impacts of E∥ on increasing the loss cone of trapped electrons. The electric field is attributed to electron convection and pressure gradient terms of generalized Ohm’s law. The MH, primarily coupling to the electron, is accompanied by electron jets. These electron jets can be interpreted as different segments of an electron vortex. These electron jets combined with nonideal electric fields not only lead to strong energy conversion (j · (E + ve × B) ∼ 40 nW m−3) from the electromagnetic field to electrons but also enable energy conversion between different electron motion directions. Our study significantly clarifies the physical image of kinetic-scale MHs.

We present a survey of 1D kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of quasi-parallel nonrelativistic shocks to identify the environments favorable for electron acceleration. We explore an unprecedented range of shock speeds vsh ≈ 0.067–0.267c, Alfvén Mach numbers , sonic Mach numbers , as well as the proton-to-electron mass ratios mi/me = 16–1836. We find that high Alfvén Mach number shocks can channel a large fraction of their kinetic energy into nonthermal particles, self-sustaining magnetic turbulence and acceleration to larger and larger energies. The fraction of injected particles is ≲0.5% for electrons and ≈1% for protons, and the corresponding energy efficiencies are ≲2% and ≈10%, respectively. The extent of the nonthermal tail is sensitive to the Alfvén Mach number; when , the nonthermal electron distribution exhibits minimal growth beyond the average momentum of the downstream thermal protons, independently of the proton-to-electron mass ratio. Acceleration is slow for shocks with low sonic Mach numbers, yet nonthermal electrons still achieve momenta exceeding the downstream thermal proton momentum when the shock Alfvén Mach number is large enough. We provide simulation-based parameterizations of the transition from thermal to nonthermal distribution in the downstream (found at a momentum around ), as well as the ratio of nonthermal electron to proton number density. The results are applicable to many different environments and are important for modeling shock-powered nonthermal radiation.

The origin of high-energy galactic cosmic rays is yet to be understood, but some galactic cosmic-ray accelerators can accelerate cosmic rays up to PeV energies. The high-energy cosmic rays are expected to interact with the surrounding material or radiation, resulting in the production of gamma-rays and neutrinos. To optimize for the detection of such associated production of gamma-rays and neutrinos for a given source morphology and spectrum, a multimessenger analysis that combines gamma-rays and neutrinos is required. In this study, we use the Multi-Mission Maximum Likelihood framework with IceCube Maximum Likelihood Analysis software and HAWC Accelerated Likelihood to search for a correlation between 22 known gamma-ray sources from the third HAWC gamma-ray catalog and 14 yr of IceCube track-like data. No significant neutrino emission from the direction of the HAWC sources was found. We report the best-fit gamma-ray model and 90% CL neutrino flux limit from the 22 sources. From the neutrino flux limit, we conclude that, for five of the sources, the gamma-ray emission observed by HAWC cannot be produced purely from hadronic interactions. We report the limit for the fraction of gamma-rays produced by hadronic interactions for these five sources.

本文讨论了太阳辐射对气候的影响，特别是在太阳活动异常低的时期。文章利用半经验模型重建了过去一千年的太阳辐射记录，发现在 Spörer 最低期（约1400年）和 Maunder 最低期（1645年至1715年）出现了辐射值下降的情况。这为我们更全面地了解太阳对气候的影响提供了重要数据。 <div>
Solar irradiance variations across various timescales, from minutes to centuries, represent a potential natural driver of past regional and global climate cold phases. To accurately assess the Sun’s effect on climate, particularly during periods of exceptionally low solar activity, known as grand minima, an accurate reconstruction of solar forcing is essential. While direct measurements of the total solar irradiance (TSI) only began in the late 1970s, with the advent of space radiometers, indirect evidence from various historical proxies suggests that the Sun’s magnetic activity has undergone possible significant fluctuations over much longer timescales. Employing diverse and independent methods for TSI reconstruction is essential to gaining a comprehensive understanding of this issue. This study employs a semi-empirical model to reconstruct TSI over the past millennium. Our approach uses an estimated open solar magnetic field (Fo), derived from cosmogenic isotope data, as a proxy for solar activity. We reconstruct the cyclic variations of TSI, due to the solar surface magnetic features, by correlating Fo with the parameter of active region functional form. We obtain the long-term TSI trend by applying the empirical mode decomposition algorithm to the reconstructed Fo to filter out the 11 yr and 22 yr solar variability. We prepare a reconstructed TSI record, spanning 971 to 2020 CE. The estimated departure from modern TSI values occurred during the Spörer minimum (around 1400 CE), with a decrease of approximately 2.3 Wm−2. A slightly smaller decline of 2.2 Wm−2 is reported during the Maunder minimum, between 1645 and 1715 CE.

我们使用来自Solar Dynamics Observatory和Solar and Heliospheric Observatory的数据，选择并研究了六次全球太阳极端紫外波事件。这些喷发都位于太阳边缘，但被记录为日冕质量抛射（CME）所驱动的震荡扩展到了相反的一侧。通过使用边缘观测避免了投影效应，我们测量了EUV波前从1.05到1.25 R⊙的倾斜度和速度。我们还调查了EUV波前与CME边界以及CME驱动的冲击波之间的耦合和联系。在这六个事件中的主要发现包括：（1）主要和日冕孔传播的EUV波前的前倾角估计，并研究了这些倾斜的起源及其对实际波前速度估计的影响；（2）环系统在日冕基部附近可以提高波前速度，在低日冕的平均速度与高日冕中CME驱动的冲击波的横向扩展之间没有明显的相关性；（3）波前的快磁音马赫数从日冕基部就大于1；（4）EUV波前在两个事件中在传播过程中与CME驱动始终耦合；（5）在EUV波前消失后，CME驱动的冲击波在相反的一侧继续传播，并在四个事件中与EUV波前断开联系。这些结果及其影响进行了讨论，这些结果有助于深入了解全球EUV波的特性。 <div>
We select and investigate six global solar extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave events using data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. These eruptions are all on the limb but recorded as halo coronal mass ejections (CMEs) because the CME-driven shocks have expanded laterally to the opposite side. With the limb observations avoiding the projection effect, we have measured the inclination and speed of the EUV wavefront from 1.05 to 1.25 R⊙. We also investigate the coupling and connection of the EUV wavefront with the CME boundary and the CME-driven shock, respectively. The major findings in the six events are: (1) the forward inclination of the primary and coronal-hole-transmitted EUV wavefronts is estimated, respectively, and the origins of these inclinations and their effects on the estimate of actual wavefronts speed are investigated; (2) the wavefront speed can be elevated by loop systems near the coronal base, and the average speed in the low corona has no clear correlation with the lateral expansion of the CME-driven shock in the high corona; (3) the fast magnetosonic Mach number of the wavefront is larger than unity from the coronal base; (4) the EUV wavefront is coupled with the CME driver throughout the propagation in two events; (5) after the EUV wavefront vanishes, the CME-driven shock continues traveling on the opposite side and disconnects from the EUV wavefront in four events. These results and their implications are discussed, which provide insight into the properties of global EUV waves.

本研究使用三维全球混合模拟来研究太阳风磁场、火星壳磁场和行星捕获离子对火星磁尾的扭曲影响。结果表明，火星壳磁场会使火星磁尾产生逆时针或顺时针扭曲，取决于太阳风磁场在火星日心坐标系中的Y分量的符号。但是，当火星壳磁场在夜侧时，扭曲更为明显，这与早期解释不同，早期解释认为火星壳磁场通过白天磁重连接影响扭曲。另外，行星捕获离子也对扭曲起作用，因为它们的质量装载减慢了等离子体流动，并导致磁场线在磁尾弯曲。研究表明，在火星阴影内的近磁尾区域（在X=-1.5RM，其中RM为火星半径），扭曲主要归因于壳磁场，而在火星阴影外和离火星较远的区域，行星捕获离子的影响开始占主导地位。 <div>
Three-dimensional global hybrid simulations are performed to explore how the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), the Martian crustal fields, and planetary pickup ions affect the twisting of the Martian magnetotail. The results agree with previous studies that the crustal magnetic fields cause the Martian magnetotail to twist counterclockwise or clockwise depending on the sign of the IMF Y-component in the Mars solar orbital coordinates. However, the twist is more pronounced when the crustal fields are on the nightside, contradicting the early explanation that the crustal fields affect the twist through dayside magnetic reconnection between the crustal fields and the draped IMF. Additionally, planetary pickup ions also contribute to the twist because their mass loading slows down the plasma flow and leads to the bending of the magnetic field lines in the magnetotail. It is demonstrated that the twist inside Mars’ shadow in the near magnetotail region (at X = −1.5 RM, where RM is Mars’ radius) is mainly attributable to the crustal fields, while the influence of planetary pickup ions starts to dominate outside Mars’ shadow and in regions further away from Mars.

黑洞的生长可以通过吸积和合并两种途径进行。本文结合了观测到的吸积途径和模拟的合并途径，描绘了超大质量黑洞（SMBH）种群的真实演化模式。研究得出了黑洞质量和宿主星系质量的比例关系，并且发现这个关系基本上没有随红移的演化。此外，研究还预测在本地宇宙中，约25%的SMBH质量可能存在于长寿命的漫游SMBH之中，并且漫游SMBH的质量分数和数量随着宿主星系质量的增加而增加。这些发现有助于我们更好地理解超大质量黑洞的演化和分布。 <br /><br />总结: 观测和模拟相结合揭示了超大质量黑洞种群的演化模式，描绘了黑洞质量和宿主星系质量的比例关系，以及漫游SMBH在本地宇宙中的存在和分布情况。 <div>
Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can grow through both accretion and mergers. It is still unclear how SMBHs evolve under these two channels from high redshifts to the SMBH population we observe in the local Universe. Observations can directly constrain the accretion channel but cannot effectively constrain mergers yet, while cosmological simulations provide galaxy merger information but can hardly return accretion properties consistent with observations. In this work, we combine the observed accretion channel and the simulated merger channel, taking advantage of observations and cosmological simulations, to depict a realistic evolution pattern of the SMBH population. With this methodology, we can derive the scaling relation between the black hole mass (MBH) and host-galaxy stellar mass (M⋆), and the local black hole mass function (BHMF). Our scaling relation is lower than those based on dynamically measured MBH, supporting the claim that dynamically measured SMBH samples may be biased. We show that the scaling relation has little redshift evolution. The BHMF steadily increases from z = 4 to z = 1 and remains largely unchanged from z = 1 to z = 0. The overall SMBH growth is generally dominated by the accretion channel, with possible exceptions at high mass (MBH ≳ 108M⊙ or M⋆ ≳ 1011M⊙) and low redshift (z ≲ 1). We also predict that around 25% of the total SMBH mass budget in the local Universe may be locked within long-lived, wandering SMBHs, and the wandering mass fraction and wandering SMBH counts increase with M⋆.

<br />
总结: 
研究表明，投射在原行星盘上的阴影可以使其变得偏心。恒星辐射在这些盘的大部分区域都占主导地位，因此不均匀的照射可以产生有趣的动力学效应。研究着重于过渡盘。作者进行了3D Athena++模拟，使用恒定的热松弛时间来描述盘对变化恒星照射的响应。发现不对称的阴影扰动了径向压力梯度，并将流体流线扭曲成一组扭曲的椭圆。这些流线之间的相互作用产生了一系列后果。对于窄环，不对称的阴影可以急剧截断其内边缘，可能解释了一些盘中观察到的陡峭密度下降，并避免了对大量扰动体的需要。对于宽环，这样的阴影可以将其拆分为两个（或可能更多）偏心环。这些环不断对彼此施加扭矩，并以健康的速率驱动气体吸积，甚至在没有盘粘度的情况下也是如此。此类扭曲的偏心环的特征可能已经被观察到，例如在气体空腔内的扭曲速度图中。我们主张进行更有针对性的观测，并更好地理解这些阴影的起源。 <div>
We demonstrate that shadows cast on a protoplanetary disk can drive it eccentric. Stellar irradiation dominates heating across much of these disks, so an uneven illumination can have interesting dynamical effects. Here, we focus on transition disks. We carry out 3D Athena++ simulations, using a constant thermal relaxation time to describe the disk’s response to changing stellar illumination. We find that an asymmetric shadow, a feature commonly observed in real disks, perturbs the radial pressure gradient and distorts the fluid streamlines into a set of twisted ellipses. Interactions between these streamlines have a range of consequences. For a narrow ring, an asymmetric shadow can sharply truncate its inner edge, possibly explaining the steep density drop-offs observed in some disks and obviating the need for massive perturbers. For a wide ring, such a shadow can dismantle it into two (or possibly more) eccentric rings. These rings continuously exert torque on each other and drive gas accretion at a healthy rate, even in the absence of disk viscosity. Signatures of such twisted eccentric rings may have already been observed as, e.g., twisted velocity maps inside gas cavities. We advocate for more targeted observations and for a better understanding on the origin of such shadows.

总结: 本研究是首次提出了Chandra X射线天文台（CXO）所发现的“脉冲星X射线丝状结构”或“不对齐的流出”。这些线性的同步辐射特征由超相对论电子和正电子提供能源，并逃离脉冲星的弓形冲击波。通过均匀的方法提取了五个确定的丝状结构和三个候选者的光谱拟合和形态特性。在档案CXO数据的搜索中，找到了一些已知的例子，并识别了一些额外的弱候选者。还报告了对具有类似产生丝状结构的脉冲星的快照CXO ACIS调查，没有发现新的丝状结构，但发现了一些弥漫辐射，包括一个PWN尾迹。最后，根据这些新观测结果，提供了一个关于产生丝状结构所需的脉冲星属性的更新模型。 <div>
We present the first Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) catalog of “pulsar X-ray filaments,” or “misaligned outflows.” These are linear, synchrotron-radiating features powered by ultrarelativistic electrons and positrons that escape from bow shock pulsars. The filaments are misaligned with the (large) pulsar velocity, distinguishing them from the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) trail, which is also often visible in CXO ACIS images. Spectral fits and morphological properties are extracted for five secure filaments and three candidates using a uniform method. We present a search of archival CXO data for linear diffuse features; the known examples are recovered and a few additional weak candidates are identified. We also report on a snapshot CXO ACIS survey of pulsars with properties similar to the filament producers, finding no new filaments but some diffuse emission, including one PWN trail. Finally, we provide an updated model for the pulsar properties required to create filaments in light of these new observations.

总结: 
通过SOFIA上的EXES仪器，我们对银河系中三个天体的分子气体进行了研究，包括IC 443的超新星遗迹、NGC 2071的中等质量星形成区域中的原恒星外流和3C 391的超新星遗迹。该研究旨在寻找C型冲击中正-反H2跃迁之间预期的速度差。与此前对HH7的类似研究不同，我们的搜索结果为阴性，未能可靠地检测到速度差。文章讨论了这种差异缺失的几种可能解释，包括预冲击正-反H2比已接近高温平衡值3（在IC 443C的情况下）、所有这些源中表现出的更复杂的冲击结构，以及观测中相对于HH7观测的更大的投影孔径尺寸。 <br /><br /> <div>
Using the EXES instrument on SOFIA, we have obtained velocity-resolved spectra of several pure rotational lines of H2 toward shocked molecular gas within three Galactic sources: the supernova remnant (SNR) IC 443 (clump C), a protostellar outflow in the intermediate-mass star-forming region NGC 2071, and the SNR 3C 391. These observations had the goal of searching for expected velocity shifts between ortho- and para-H2 transitions emitted by C-type shocks. In contrast in our previous similar study of HH7, the result of our search was negative: no velocity shifts were reliably detected. Several possible explanations for the absence of such shifts are discussed: these include a preshock ortho-to-para ratio that is already close to the high-temperature equilibrium value of 3 (in the case of IC 443C), the more complex shock structures evident in all these sources, and the larger projected aperture sizes relative to those in the observations of HH7.

<div> 高精度观测，TIC 400562821，脉动行为，三个频率，高振幅δ Scuti星，非线性响应，振幅变化，稳定振幅，径向恒星脉动建模，恒星演化

总结:<br /><br />本研究使用高精度TESS观测探究了TIC 400562821的脉动行为，发现其为三模式高振幅δ Scuti星，振幅变化稳定。径向恒星脉动建模表明，虽然F模式振幅保持恒定，但F1逐渐减小，F2接近于零，暗示TIC 400562821可能最终演化为单模式HADS星。此外，通过测定αMLT和非绝热等参数，推测TIC 400562821可能处于主序星后阶段，但仍需进一步研究确认其性质。 <div>
We investigated the pulsating behavior of TIC 400562821 using high-precision observations from TESS. Fourier analysis of time-series data revealed three independent frequencies. The period ratios of F to F1 (0.774) and F to F2 (0.625), along with an amplitude change of approximately 0.1 mag, indicate that TIC 400562821 is a triple-mode High-Amplitude δ Scuti (HADS) star. Using the Best Parent Method and the ΓO functions, we identified that the harmonics and sum combination frequencies of F and F1 are caused by the nonlinear response of the stellar medium to pulsation. We also analyzed the amplitude variations of F, F1, and F2. Observational data over 76 days show stable amplitudes for these modes. However, Radial Stellar Pulsations modeling suggests that, over 10,000 cycles, the amplitude of F remains constant, while F1 gradually decreases and F2 approaches zero. This implies that TIC 400562821 may eventually evolve into a single-mode HADS star. Furthermore, asteroseismic modeling was performed, and several effects, such as the mixing-length parameter αMLT and nonadiabatic, were examined on this star. In view of the results by Daszyńska-Daszkiewicz et al. (i.e., αMLT < ∼1 for δ Scuti stars), TIC 400562821 is suggested to be more likely in the post-main-sequence stage, with mass M = 1.34–1.38 M⊙ and metallicity Z = 0.007–0.008, but still warrants further study to ascertain its nature.

The recent results from the first-year baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data released by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernova (SN) data, have shown a detection of significant deviation from a cosmological constant for dark energy. In this work, we utilize the latest DESI BAO data in combination with the SN data from the full 5 yr observations of the Dark Energy Survey and the CMB data from the Planck satellite to explore potential interactions between dark energy and dark matter. We consider four typical forms of the interaction term Q. Our findings suggest that interacting dark energy (IDE) models with Q ∝ ρde support the presence of an interaction where dark energy decays into dark matter. Specifically, the deviation from ΛCDM for the IDE model with Q = βH0ρde reaches the 3σ level. These models yield a lower value of Akaike information criterion than the ΛCDM model, indicating a preference for these IDE models based on the current observational data. For IDE models with Q ∝ ρc, the existence of interaction depends on the form of the proportionality coefficient Γ. The IDE model with Q = βHρc yields β = 0.0003 ± 0.0011, which essentially does not support the presence of the interaction. In general, whether the observational data support the existence of interaction is closely related to the model. Our analysis helps to elucidate which type of IDE model can better explain the current observational data.

总结:<br />
TianQin提出利用激光干涉测量来检测引力波信号，但激光传播效应可能引入潜在噪声因素。研究使用磁流体动力学模拟来获得极强太阳耀斑期间的空间磁场和等离子体分布，并基于模拟结果，调查了TianQin项目的激光传播噪声。对于极强太阳耀斑事件，发现激光传播噪声接近于Michelson组合的100%位移噪声要求，而对于时间延迟干涉法（TDI）-X组合，激光传播噪声仍然约为TianQin位移噪声要求的30%。另外，研究了12个不同太阳风条件下的激光传播噪声。发现激光传播噪声与一些太空天气参数（如太阳风动压、Sym-H和Dst）呈线性相关，其中太阳风动压的相关系数最强。整合1999年至2021年太阳风动压的累积分布和太阳风动压与激光传播噪声的线性相关，确定Michelson组合在整个太阳活动周内发生激光传播噪声超过TianQin要求30%以上的发生率约为15%。此外，发现TDI可以抑制激光传播噪声，并将激光传播噪声超过TianQin要求的发生率减少至1%以下。 <div>
TianQin (TQ) proposes to detect gravitational-wave signals by using laser interferometry. However, the laser propagation effect introduces a potential noise factor for TQ. In this work, we used magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to obtain the space magnetic field and plasma distributions during an extremely strong solar eruption, and based on the MHD simulation result, we investigated laser propagation noise for TQ. For the extremely strong solar eruption event, we find that the laser propagation noise closely approaches 100% of TQ’s displacement noise requirement for the Michelson combination, while the laser propagation noise is still about 30% of TQ’s displacement noise requirement for time-delay interferometry (TDI)-X combination. In addition, we investigate the laser propagation noise for 12 cases with different solar wind conditions. Our finding reveals a linear correlation between the laser propagation noise and several space weather parameters, e.g., solar wind dynamic pressure, Sym-H, and Dst, where the correlation coefficients for solar wind dynamic pressure are strongest. Combining the cumulative distribution of solar wind dynamic pressure from 1999 to 2021 with the linear correlation between solar wind dynamic pressure and laser propagation noise, we have determined that the occurrence rate of the laser propagation noise to be greater than 30% of TQ’s displacement noise requirement for the Michelson combination over the entire solar activity week is about 15%. In addition, we find that TDI can suppress the laser propagation noise, and reduce the occurrence rate of the laser propagation noise exceeding 30% of TQ’s requirement to less than 1%.

总结：<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了行星和恒星质量黑洞在盘状星系中的角动量交换和迁移过程。研究发现，盘状星系中的行星/黑洞会与盘内气体进行角动量交换，导致其迁移方向发生变化。研究使用了二维全局流体动力学模拟，考虑了重力、压力、粘性等因素对行星/黑洞和盘内气体之间的角动量交换。当行星/黑洞处于不断吸积状态时，发现由盘内气体向行星/黑洞传递的正角动量导致其发生外迁。此外，研究还发现在全局稳态条件下，质量和角动量通量在盘中是恒定的，除了在行星/黑洞位置会出现跳跃，这些跳跃与行星/黑洞的吸积率和力矩相匹配。因此，文章建议在应用盘中迁移标准结果到不断吸积的行星和黑洞时需要谨慎。 <div>
Nascent planets are thought to lose angular momentum (AM) to the gaseous protoplanetary disk via gravitational interactions, leading to inward migration. A similar migration process also applies to stellar-mass black holes (BHs) embedded in the disks of active galactic nuclei. However, AM exchange via accretion onto the planet/BH may strongly influence the migration torque. In this study, we perform 2D global hydrodynamic simulations of an accreting planet/BH embedded in a disk, where AM exchange between the planet/BH and disk via gravity, accretion, pressure, and viscosity are considered. When accretion is turned off, we recover the linear estimate for Type I migration torque. However, for the two planet masses we investigated with our accreting simulations, we find outward migration due to the positive AM deposited onto the accreting body by the disk gas. Our simulations achieve the global steady state for the transport of mass and AM: The mass and AM fluxes are constant across the disk except for jumps ( and ) at the planet’s location, and the jumps match the accretion rate and torque on the planet. Our findings suggest that caution is needed when applying the standard results of disk migration to accreting planets and BHs.

Strong gravitational lenses are a singular probe of the Universe’s small-scale structure—they are sensitive to the gravitational effects of low-mass (<1010M⊙) halos even without a luminous counterpart. Recent strong-lensing analyses of dark matter structure rely on simulation-based inference (SBI). Modern SBI methods, which leverage neural networks as density estimators, have shown promise in extracting the halo-population signal. However, it is unclear whether the constraints from these models are limited by the methodology or the data. In this study, we introduce an accelerator-optimized simulation pipeline that can generate lens images with realistic subhalo populations in milliseconds. Leveraging this simulator, we identify the main limitation of our fiducial SBI analysis: training set size. We then adopt a sequential neural posterior estimation (SNPE) approach, allowing us to refine the training distribution to align with the observed data. Using only one-fifth as many mock Hubble Space Telescope images, SNPE matches the constraints on the low-mass halo population produced by our best nonsequential model. Our experiments suggest that an over 3 order-of-magnitude increase in training set size and GPU hours would be required to achieve an equivalent result without sequential methods. While the full potential of the existing lens sample remains to be explored, the notable improvement in constraining power enabled by our sequential approach highlights that current constraints are limited primarily by methodology and not the data itself. Moreover, our results emphasize the need to treat training set generation and model optimization as interconnected stages of any cosmological analysis using SBI.

Dense cores inherit turbulent motions from the interstellar medium in which they form. As a tool for comparison to both simulations and observations, it is valuable to construct theoretical core models that can relate their internal density and velocity structure while predicting their stability to gravitational collapse. To this end, we solve the angle-averaged equations of hydrodynamics under two assumptions: (1) the system is in a quasi-steady equilibrium; (2) the velocity field consists of radial bulk motion plus isotropic turbulence, with turbulent dispersion increasing as a power law in the radius. The resulting turbulent equilibrium sphere (TES) solutions form a two-parameter family, characterized by the sonic radius rs and the power-law index p. The TES is equivalent to a Bonnor–Ebert (BE) sphere when rs → ∞ . The density profile in the outer regions of the TES is slightly shallower than the BE sphere, but is steeper than the logotropic model. Stability analysis shows that the TESs with size exceeding a certain critical radius are unstable to radial perturbations. The center-to-edge density contrast, mass, and radius of the marginally stable TES all increase with increasing average velocity dispersion. The FWHM of the column density profile is always smaller than the critical radius, by a larger factor at higher velocity dispersion, suggesting that observations need to probe beyond the FWHM to capture the full extent of turbulent cores. When applied to the highly turbulent regime typical of cluster-forming clumps, the critical mass and radius of the TES intriguingly resembles the typical mass and radius of observed star clusters.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了一个名为Synthetic Corona Outflow Model (SynCOM)的经验模型，该模型可以模拟太阳冠层的动态，以匹配高分辨率观测，并提供了一个有用的资源，用于测试速度测量算法。SynCOM生成合成图像，描述了总亮度的径向变化，并包括等离子体流动和仪器噪声的随机元素。它利用预定义的流速概率分布和可调的信噪比，评估了不同的冠层流动数据分析方法。通过调整参数以匹配特定的冠层和仪器条件，SynCOM提供了一个平台，用于评估确定冠层流速和加速度的方法。验证这些测量结果将有助于我们理解太阳风的起源，并支持Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere (PUNCH)等任务。在这项研究中，我们演示了如何利用SynCOM来评估两种不同的流动跟踪方法的精度和性能。通过提供基于观测数据的参考标准，我们强调了SynCOM在确认用于检测冠层流动的观测标准方面的重要性。 <div>
The Synthetic Corona Outflow Model (SynCOM), an empirical model, simulates the solar corona’s dynamics to match high-resolution observations, providing a useful resource for testing velocity measurement algorithms. SynCOM generates synthetic images depicting radial variability in total brightness and includes stochastic elements for plasma outflows and instrumental noise. It employs a predefined probability distribution for flow velocity and an adjustable signal-to-noise ratio to evaluate different data analysis methods for coronal flows. By adjusting parameters to match specific coronal and instrumental conditions, SynCOM offers a platform to assess these methods for determining coronal velocity and acceleration. Validating these measurements would help us to understand the origins of the solar wind and support missions such as the Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere (PUNCH). In this study, we demonstrate how SynCOM can be employed to assess the precision and performance of two different flow-tracking methods. By providing a ground truth based on observational data, we highlight the importance of SynCOM in confirming observational standards for detecting coronal flows.

<div> 关键词: Gaia XP spectroscopy, Milky Way, metal-rich stars, TNG50 simulations, Galactic EMR knot <br />
总结: 通过Gaia XP光谱学，我们发现银河系中极端富含金属的恒星主要集中在一个紧凑的“节点”处，这个节点在投影上是圆形的，在RGC，proj约1.5千秒巴附近有一个相当明显的边缘，是一个动力学上活跃的系统。银河系中富含金属的节点也包含了非常金属丰富的恒星。然而，与EMR恒星不同，大部分VMR恒星形成了内部银河系中扁平分布。我们利用TNG50模拟来进行比较，发现紧凑、富含金属的节点限制在大约1.5千秒巴内是一个普遍的特征。在我们的银河系数据中，最富含金属的恒星仅占0.1%。需要进行穿透尘埃的广域近红外光谱观测，如第五次斯隆数字天文学调查，才能对银河系EMR节点中恒星的比例进行严格估计。值得解释的是，为什么在我们的银河系中，只有EMR巨星被限制在这样一个中心节点。值得注意的是，银河系中心几千秒巴的范围内既有最集中的贫金属恒星（“贫穷的老心脏”），也几乎包含所有富含金属的恒星。这突显了在银河系重力势阱底部的恒星种群多样性。 <br /> <div>
We show with Gaia XP spectroscopy that extremely metal-rich (EMR) stars in the Milky Way ([M/H]XP ≳ 0.5) are largely confined to a tight “knot” at the center of the Galaxy. This EMR knot is round in projection, has a fairly abrupt edge near RGC,proj ∼ 1.5 kpc, and is a dynamically hot system. This central knot also contains very metal-rich (VMR; +0.2 ≤ [M/H]XP ≤ +0.4) stars. However, in contrast to EMR stars, the bulk of VMR stars forms an extended, highly flattened distribution in the inner Galaxy (RGC ≲ 5 kpc). We draw on TNG50 simulations of Milky Way analogs for context and find that compact, metal-rich knots confined to ≲1.5 kpc are a universal feature. In typical simulated analogs, the top 5%–10% most metal-rich stars are confined to a central knot; however, in our Milky Way data this fraction is only 0.1%. Dust-penetrating wide-area near-infrared spectroscopy, such as the fifth Sloan Digital Sky Survey, will be needed for a rigorous estimate of the fraction of stars in the Galactic EMR knot. Why in our Milky Way only EMR giants are confined to such a central knot remains to be explained. Remarkably, the central few kiloparsecs of the Milky Way harbor both the highest concentration of metal-poor stars (the “poor old heart”) and almost all EMR stars. This highlights the stellar population diversity at the bottom of galactic potential wells.

<title>Radial Wave in the Galactic Disk: New Clues to Discriminate Different Perturbations</title>

<div> Gaia DR3, Galactic disk structure, wave pattern, perturbations, bar<br /> <br />总结:<br />银河系盘结构的动态过程对于重建银河系的进化历史至关重要。最新的Gaia DR3数据显示，在LZ−〈VR〉空间中出现了一种新的波动模式，但它的形成机制仍然不清楚。通过利用最新的Gaia DR3数据，我们发现LZ−〈VR〉波动会随着动力学热量更大、JZ值更大的恒星而系统性地向更低的LZ偏移。我们进行了三组测试粒子模拟以区分不同扰动因素的作用。结果显示LZ−〈VR〉波更可能是内部起源的。此外，将ΔLZ峰值与2:1 OLR相联系提供了一种约束银河系棒的转动速度的新方法，支持了长/慢棒模型。 <div>
Decoding the key dynamical processes that shape the Galactic disk structure is crucial for reconstructing the Milky Way’s evolution history. The second Gaia data release unveils a novel wave pattern in the LZ−〈VR〉 space, but its formation mechanism remains elusive due to the intricate nature of involved perturbations and the challenges in disentangling their effects. Utilizing the latest Gaia DR3 data, we find that the LZ−〈VR〉 wave systematically shifts toward lower LZ for dynamically hotter stars with larger JZ values. The amplitude of this phase shift between stars of different dynamical hotness (ΔLZ) peaks at around 2100 km s−1 kpc. To differentiate the role of different perturbations, we perform three sets of test particle simulations, wherein a satellite galaxy, transient spiral arms, and a bar plus the transient spiral arms act as the sole perturber, respectively. Under the satellite impact, the phase shift amplitude ΔLZ decreases toward higher LZ, which we interpret through a toy model of radial phase mixing. While neither the transient spiral arms nor the bar generates an azimuthally universal phase shift variation pattern, combining the bar and spirals generates a characteristic ΔLZ peak at the 2:1 outer Lindblad resonance (OLR) of the bar, qualitatively resembling the observed feature. Therefore, the LZ−〈VR〉 wave is more likely of internal origin. Furthermore, linking the ΔLZ peak to the 2:1 OLR offers a novel approach to constraining the pattern speed of the Galactic bar, supporting the long/slow bar model.

总结：<br /><br />本研究使用多流体模型模拟了高β质子-电子等离子体中平行质子飞鞭不稳定性的演化和饱和过程，无需添加人工粘性。研究发现，在所有物种中允许压力各向异性发展时，电子对平行质子飞鞭不稳定性的饱和有显著影响，调节了不稳定性饱和时的质子压力各向异性。即使对于与太阳圈等离子体更相关的较低β值，使用梯度松弛闭合的模拟中也观察到了明显的电子能量化现象。我们的研究结果表明，解决电子压力各向异性对于正确描述多种物种等离子体系统的行为是重要的。 <div>
Instabilities driven by pressure anisotropy play a critical role in modulating the energy transfer in space and astrophysical plasmas. For the first time, we simulate the evolution and saturation of the parallel proton firehose instability using a multifluid model without adding artificial viscosity. These simulations are performed using a 10-moment, multifluid model with local and gradient relaxation heat-flux closures in high-β proton–electron plasmas. When these higher-order moments are included and pressure anisotropy is permitted to develop in all species, we find that the electrons have a significant impact on the saturation of the parallel proton firehose instability, modulating the proton pressure anisotropy as the instability saturates. Even for lower β's more relevant to heliospheric plasmas, we observe a pronounced electron energization in simulations using the gradient relaxation closure. Our results indicate that resolving the electron pressure anisotropy is important to correctly describe the behavior of multispecies plasma systems.

<div> 关键词: Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer, 热量分布, Bayesian分析, 加热机制, 重连加热模型

总结:<br />
本文利用Hinode/EUV成像光谱仪获取的数据，对18个日冕环进行分析，得出加热分布随着加热规模高度朝向日冕环顶部递减，加热速率在过渡区高度为E0 = 10^(-2.0±0.5) erg cm^(-3) s^(-1)，并估计得到加热流量FH = 10^(7.0±0.4) erg cm^(-2) s^(-1)。研究发现使用成像数据会导致对电子密度和E0、FH的低估，最终得出重连加热模型是最合理的结论。 <div>
Heating distributions along coronal loops are obtained from spectroscopic data with the Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer. The loop half-lengths Lhalf are in the range of 24–107 Mm for our analysis of 18 loops. By using the analytical approximations to 1D hydrostatic numerical calculations of electron temperature Te(s) and density distributions ne(s) along a loop, the heating distribution that decreases with a heating scale height sH toward the loop top with a heating rate E0 at the height of the transition region is estimated by applying a Bayesian analysis to the observed Te(s) and ne(s) derived by emission line ratios. We obtain sH = 10 ± 4 Mm increasing with Lhalf, E0 = 10−2.0±0.5 erg cm−3 s−1 decreasing with Lhalf, and the heating flux FH = 107.0±0.4 erg cm−2 s−1. These loops show sH/Lhalf = 0.21 ± 0.07, suggesting the concentration of the heating near the lower part. Compared to the previous study using imaging data, sH is comparable, while E0 and FH are about an order of magnitude larger. We find that using the imaging data leads to the underestimation of the electron density and consequently the underestimation of E0 and FH. We examine heating mechanisms using the power-law relation for FH, the field strength Bbase and Lhalf: . We find and , which show that the reconnection heating model is the most plausible.

Knowledge of the global magnetic field distribution and its evolution on the Sun’s surface is crucial for modeling the coronal magnetic field, understanding the solar wind dynamics, computing the heliospheric open flux distribution, and predicting the solar cycle strength. As the far side of the Sun cannot be observed directly and high-latitude observations always suffer from projection effects, we often rely on surface flux transport (SFT) simulations to model the long-term global magnetic field distribution. Meridional circulation, the large-scale north–south component of the surface flow profile, is one of the key components of the SFT simulation that requires further constraints near high latitudes. Prediction of the photospheric magnetic field distribution requires knowledge of the flow profile in the future, which demands reconstruction of that same flow at the current time so that it can be estimated at a later time. By performing Observing System Simulation Experiments, we demonstrate how the ensemble Kalman filter technique, when used with an SFT model, can be utilized to make “posterior” estimates of flow profiles into the future that can be used to drive the model forward to forecast the photospheric magnetic field distribution.

Interpreting and reconstructing distant sources that are gravitationally lensed by galaxy clusters requires accurate and precise lens models. While high-quality data sets have reduced statistical errors in such models, systematic errors remain important. We examine systematic lensing effects caused by density fluctuations due to large-scale structure along the line of sight. We use a multiplane ray-tracing algorithm with the IllustrisTNG 100-3 cosmological simulation of matter distribution and compute the statistical distributions of shear, convergence, and higher-order deflections using two Hubble Frontier Field clusters as examples (A2744 and MACS J0416.1−2403). The cosmic shear distribution is Gaussian in each component, while the cosmic convergence distribution is skewed such that 1 + κ is consistent with a log-normal distribution; the standard deviations for these quantities are at the level of a few to 10%, depending on the redshift of the source. The deflection from higher-order terms beyond convergence and shear has significant scatter: the rms deflection is ∼15″, considerably larger than the image position residuals for current lens models. These results indicate that line-of-sight deflection effects due to large-scale structure can significantly impact lens models and should not be neglected. We present results in forms that can be incorporated into future cluster lens models.

<div> 关键词: 快速射电暴（FRB），磁星，O模式，X模式，等离子体冲击<br />
<br />
本研究调查了在磁星附近发出的快速射电爆发（FRB）是如何通过其周围的偶极磁层（r = 10^7–10^9厘米）传播的。首先，我们显示出在O模式下发射的GHz射电暴，只有沿着磁轴方向有一个狭窄的锥形区域是不会被立即衰减的。然后，我们研究了X模式下的射电暴。在靠近磁赤道附近传播的GHz波将表现为磁流体力学波，如果它们的能量远远大于10^40erg/s。这些波将在每次振荡中形成等离子体冲击并在厘米尺度处耗散。具有较低能量或者传播方向更接近磁轴的波不服从磁流体力学规律，而是与单个粒子相互作用，并需要动力学描述。动力学相互作用会迅速将粒子加速到洛伦兹因子为10^4–10^5，这将以波能量为代价，最终导致波的强烈衰减。在任一传播范围内，无论是磁流体力学还是动力学，包围FRB源的偶极磁层都会作为吸收射电暴并在X射线中重新辐射吸收能量的枕头。这些结果限制了观测到的FRB的起源。我们认为观测到的FRB之所以避免衰减，是因为它们是由磁星爆发产生的相对论外流所发出的，因此GHz波不需要通过包围磁星的外部平衡磁层传播。 <br /><br />总结: 这项研究揭示了快速射电爆发在磁星周围磁层中的传播行为，并指出了观测到的FRB避免衰减的可能原因。 <div>
We investigate how a fast radio burst (FRB) emitted near a magnetar would propagate through its surrounding dipole magnetosphere at radii r = 107–109 cm. First, we show that a GHz burst emitted in the O-mode with luminosity L ≫ 1040 erg s−1 is immediately damped for all propagation directions except a narrow cone along the magnetic axis. Then, we examine bursts in the X-mode. GHz waves propagating near the magnetic equator behave as magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves if they have L ≫ 1040 erg s−1. The waves develop plasma shocks in each oscillation and dissipate at cm. Waves with lower L or propagation directions closer to the magnetic axis do not obey MHD. Instead, they interact with individual particles and require a kinetic description. The kinetic interaction quickly accelerates particles to Lorentz factors 104–105 at the expense of the wave energy, which again results in strong damping of the wave. In either propagation regime, MHD or kinetic, the dipole magnetosphere surrounding the FRB source acts as a pillow absorbing the radio burst and reradiating the absorbed energy in X-rays. These results constrain the origin of observed FRBs. We argue that the observed FRBs avoid damping because they are emitted by relativistic outflows from magnetospheric explosions, so that the GHz waves do not need to propagate through the outer equilibrium magnetosphere surrounding the magnetar.

Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can be ejected from their galactic centers due to gravitational wave recoil or the slingshot mechanism following a galaxy merger. If an ejected SMBH retains its inner accretion disk, it may be visible as an off-nuclear active galactic nucleus (AGN). At present, only a handful of offset AGNs that are recoil or slingshot candidates have been found, and none have been robustly confirmed. Compiling a large sample of runaway SMBHs would enable us to constrain the mass and spin evolution of binary SMBHs and study feedback effects of displaced AGNs. We adapt the method of varstrometry—which was developed for Gaia observations to identify off-center, dual, and lensed AGNs—in order to quickly identify off-nuclear AGNs in optical survey data by looking for an excess of blue versus red astrometric jitter. We apply this to the Pan-STARRS1 3π Survey and report on five new runaway AGN candidates. We focus on ZTF18aajyzfv: a luminous quasar offset by 6.7 ± 0.2 kpc from an adjacent galaxy at z = 0.224, and conclude after Keck LRIS spectroscopy and comparison to ASTRID simulation analogs that it is likely a dual AGN. This selection method can be easily adapted to work with data from the soon-to-be commissioned Vera C. Rubin Telescope Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). LSST will have a higher cadence and deeper magnitude limit than Pan-STARRS1, and should permit detection of many more runaway SMBH candidates.

总结:<br /><br />
本研究利用James Webb Space Telescope的成功性能推进了我们对宇宙再离子化时期的理解。通过合成不同红移下的观测数据，我们发现星系计数和视星等基于紫外线光度函数，其中包括红移依赖的星体形成效率（SFE）和对尘埃衰减的修正。进一步的分析显示，汤姆逊散射光学深度为某值，再离子化始于某红移，结束于某红移，而这并不受UV光度函数截断等选择的影响。通过结合其他数据集和一些合理的限制，我们发现物质扰动的振幅为σ8 = 0.80 ± 0.05，与标准ΛCDM模型一致。未来的星系调查和星系演化的动力学模拟将打破SFE和宇宙学参数之间的退化，进一步提高UV光度函数模型的准确性和精度。 <div>
Thanks to the successful performance of the James Webb Space Telescope, our understanding of the epoch of reionization of the Universe has been advanced. The ultraviolet luminosity functions (UV LFs) of galaxies span a wide range of redshifts, not only revealing the connection between galaxies and dark matter (DM) halos but also providing information during reionization. In this work, we develop a model connecting galaxy counts and apparent magnitude based on UV LFs, which incorporates redshift-dependent star formation efficiency (SFE) and corrections for dust attenuation. By synthesizing some observations across the redshift range of 4 ≤ z ≤ 10 from various galaxy surveys, we discern the evolving SFE with increasing redshift and DM halo mass through model fitting. Subsequent analyses indicate that the Thomson scattering optical depth was and the epoch of reionization started (ended) at ( ), which is insensitive to the choice of the truncated magnitude of the UV LFs. Incorporating additional data sets and some reasonable constraints, the amplitude of matter perturbation is found to be σ8 = 0.80 ± 0.05, which is consistent with the standard ΛCDM model. Future galaxy surveys and the dynamical simulations of galaxy evolution will break the degeneracy between SFE and cosmological parameters, improving the accuracy and the precision of the UV LF model further.

总结:<br /><br />本研究通过磁流体动力学模拟了巨型分子云中尘埃粒子大小变化对热化学和演化的影响。研究发现，较大的尘埃粒子导致较低的尘埃不透明度，使星际辐射能更深地穿透云层，导致气体加热迅速和抑制星际形成。尘埃粒子大小变化对星际形成效率也有显著影响，当尘埃粒子动态范围增加时，星际形成效率可降低一个数量级。此外，较高温度的气体抑制了低质量星际形成，尘埃不透明度的降低导致更多的气体在扩散的电离结构中存在。 <div>
The dust grain size distribution (GSD) likely varies significantly across star-forming environments in the Universe, but its impact on star formation remains unclear. This ambiguity arises because the GSD interacts nonlinearly with processes like heating, cooling, radiation, and chemistry, which have competing effects and varying environmental dependencies. Processes such as grain coagulation, expected to be efficient in dense star-forming regions, reduce the abundance of small grains and increase that of larger grains. Motivated by this, we investigate the effects of similar GSD variations on the thermochemistry and evolution of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) using magnetohydrodynamic simulations spanning a range of cloud masses and grain sizes, which explicitly incorporate the dynamics of dust grains within the full-physics framework of the STARFORGE project. We find that grain size variations significantly alter GMC thermochemistry: the leading-order effect is that larger grains, under fixed dust mass, GSD dynamic range, and dust-to-gas ratio, result in lower dust opacities. This reduced opacity permits interstellar radiation field and internal radiation photons to penetrate more deeply. This leads to rapid gas heating and inhibited star formation. Star formation efficiency is highly sensitive to grain size, with an order-of-magnitude reduction when grain size dynamic range increases from 10−3–0.1 μm to 0.1–10 μm. Additionally, warmer gas suppresses low-mass star formation, and decreased opacities result in a greater proportion of gas in diffuse ionized structures.

We present progress on the translational tomography technique for measuring the three-dimensional structure of the corona from near-perihelion Wide-field Imager for Parker Solar Probe (WISPR) image sequences. Translational tomography makes use of noncircular motion of a camera to extract three-dimensional information from an optically thin subject. Parker Solar Probe (PSP) presents a special case both because of the particular structure of the corona and because of the nonlinear motion of the vantage point. We show improvements to a previous direct analytic method (described in Paper I of this series) and an alternative inversion pathway using a synthetic sequence of WISPR images. The newer method successfully reconstructs the correct locations of modeled coronal rays in a synthetic WISPR image sequence, with curvilinear camera motion modeled on the PSP orbit. We present the refined methodology and validation study, and show that the technique is ready for application to actual WISPR data.

总结:
本研究通过对地球磁层中离子群体的观测，发现了不同类型的离子种群共存，如太阳风带来的质子和较重的氦离子（阿尔法粒子）。我们从第一原理出发，探讨了这种多离子等离子体环境中孤立电波的发生条件。非线性分析表明，离子束对多成分等离子体（包括玻尔兹曼电子和建模为冷热（绝热）离子的离子种类）中的阻带出现有影响。我们的参数分析揭示，随着热离子束的速度增加，冷离子电荷密度的范围内阻带变宽。然而，在反向传播的束流情况下，阻带变窄。类似地，冷离子束沿或逆波传播方向的流动导致阻带变窄或变宽。快速孤立子存在的速度范围由两个临界点（交叉点和转折点）所刻画，它们受到束流的影响。我们的研究对于理解太阳风中主要离子（质子）和次要离子（阿尔法粒子）之间相对漂移导致两种离子加热的能量耗散过程具有相关性。 <div>
Satellite observations in the Earth’s magnetosphere suggest a coexistence of different types of ion populations, such as protons and heavier helium ions (alpha particles) transported by the solar wind. We have undertaken an investigation, from first principles, of the conditions for the occurrence of electrostatic solitary waves in such a multi-ion plasma environment. Nonlinear analysis has been employed to explore the effect of an ion beam on the occurrence of stopbands in a multicomponent plasma consisting of Boltzmann electrons and two ion species, modeled as cold and warm (adiabatic) ions. A “stopband” is an interval of pulse speed (mach (Mach number) values in which solitary waves cannot propagate. Such stopbands are known to exist in relation to fast ion-acoustic solitary waves (exclusively). Our parametric analysis reveals that the stopband widens over the range of cold ion charge density (values) upon increasing speed of a hot ion beam moving along the direction of wave propagation. However, the stopband becomes narrower in the case of a counterpropagating beam. Similarly, the streaming of a cold ion beam fluid along (or antiparallel) to the wave direction leads to the narrowing (or widening, respectively) of the stopband. The fast soliton existence (velocity) domain is characterized by two critical points (a crossover and a turning point), which are affected by the beam. Our study could be relevant to understanding energy dissipation processes in the fast solar wind associated with relative drifts between the major (protons) and minor (alpha particles) ions which results in the heating of both species.

<div> 关键词: Cygnus Loop, core-collapse supernova, point-symmetrical morphology, jittering jets explosion mechanism, CCSNe

总结:
Cygnus Loop是一个核心坍缩超新星遗迹，通过分析不同的发射波段图像，发现其具有点对称形态，由三对喷流塑造而成。主要的喷流轴呈S形，被称为S形软管，其它两条线连接着一个突起和中心对面的孔洞，这些结构在X射线、紫外、可见光、红外和/或无线电图像中都有体现。Cygnus Loop的点对称形态符合核心坍缩超新星爆炸机制的预期，这个机制认为数对随机方向变化的喷流引发了星体的爆炸。这项研究进一步支持了这一机制作为核心坍缩超新星的主要爆炸机制。 <div>
Analyzing images of the Cygnus Loop, a core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant, in different emission bands, we identify a point-symmetrical morphology composed of three symmetry axes that we attribute to shaping by three pairs of jets. The main jet axis has an elongated S shape, appearing as a faint narrow zone in visible and UV. We term it the S-shaped hose, and the structure of three symmetry lines the point-symmetric wind rose. The two other lines connect a protrusion (an ear or a bulge) with a hole on the opposite side of the center (a nozzle or a cavity), structures that we identify in the X-ray, UV, visible, IR, and/or radio images. There is a well-known blowout at the southern end of the S-shaped hose, and we identify a possible opposite blowout at the northern end of the S-shaped hose. The point-symmetrical morphology of the Cygnus Loop is according to the expectation of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) of CCSNe, where several to few tens of pairs of jets with stochastically varying directions explode the star. The three pairs of jets that shaped the wind-rose structure of the Cygnus Loop are the last energetic pairs of this series of jets. Our study further supports the JJEM as the main explosion mechanism of CCSNe.

<div> threads, displacement, intensity oscillations, quiescent prominence, New Vacuum Solar Telescope

总结：<br /><br />本文使用New Vacuum Solar Telescope观测到的日冕静态日珥中心Hα线上的数据，对日珥中的线索位移和强度振荡进行了研究。通过对观测数据的分析，发现了35条在线状结构，其中29条线索展示出位移振荡，平均周期为26分钟；另有8条线索展示出强度振荡，平均周期为7.7分钟；而7条线索同时表现出了位移和强度的振荡。此外，通过对线索不同位置进行分析，发现线索的振荡很可能是一种驻波，但也可能是一种长波传播波。这些发现有助于我们更深入地理解太阳上的复杂动态过程。 <div>
In this paper, we investigate the thread displacement and intensity oscillations in a quiescent prominence observed by New Vacuum Solar Telescope at the Hα line center on 2019 October 31. Each individual thread is traced by the local maximum intensity among its width at various times. In total, 35 threads are detected at six heights parallel to the solar surface. We find 29/35 threads exhibiting the displacement oscillation. A sinusoidal function is used to fit them, and a mean period of 26 minutes is identified. By slicing the same thread at different positions, we find that the oscillation of the thread is very likely a standing wave, but it could also be a long-wavelength propagating wave. After integrating the intensity along the thread width, we also find 8/35 threads presenting their intensity oscillation with a mean period of 7.7 minutes. In total, 7/35 threads exhibit both the displacement and the intensity oscillations.

总结: <br />
本研究利用SDSS的Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey和Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey目录，通过精确的光谱红移估计了由太阳系的固有运动引起的动力红移二极性。结果表明，从动力红移二极性中提取的速度与宇宙微波背景辐射推导的值是一致的。尽管SDSS的天区覆盖范围小且光源数量密度有限，限制了我们获取精确和可靠的测量结果，但我们通过红移二极性方法估计了动力红移二极性。本研究中的速度测量对与光源计数二极性相关的固有聚集效应不敏感。本工作测量的动力红移二极性及其与宇宙微波背景辐射值的一致性并不保证大尺度上的各向同性。天文射电台VLASS调查和广域红外勘测卫星目录测量的各向同性偏差可能是由于星系的固有分布。该研究结果仅关注动力红移二极性项。 <div>
We utilize the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey and Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey catalogs with precise spectroscopic redshifts to estimate the kinematic redshift dipole caused by the proper motion of the solar system. We find that the velocity extracted from the kinematic dipole is consistent with cosmic microwave background (CMB) inferred values. Although the small sky coverage and limited number density of the SDSS sources constrain us from obtaining precise and robust measurements, we leverage the redshift dipole method to estimate the kinematic dipole. The velocity measurements in this study are insensitive to intrinsic clustering, associated with the source count dipole. The kinematic dipole measured in this work and its consistency with CMB values do not guarantee isotropy at large scales. The anisotropy (excess dipole) measured with the NRAO VLA Sky Survey and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer Catalog could be due to the intrinsic distribution of galaxies. The results in this work focus solely on the kinematic dipole term.

<div> 关键词: resonant friction, disk rotation, nuclear star cluster, gravitational perturbation, black hole spins

总结：<br /><br />本文主要讨论了共振摩擦对旋转方向与核心星团不一致的盘状结构的影响。这种盘状结构的重力会对星团造成引力干扰，从而对盘状结构产生强大的扭矩。作者认为这种扭矩可能是银河中心年轻恒星的盘状结构破裂的原因，并通过数值实验证明了这种效应对恒星角动量分布的影响。此外，文章还推测了核心星团的旋转对围绕超大质量黑洞的临时大质量吸积盘的方向和黑洞自旋的稳定效应。 <div>
We argue that resonant friction has a dramatic effect on a disk whose rotation direction is misaligned with that of its host nuclear star cluster. The disk’s gravity causes gravitational perturbation of the cluster that in turn exerts a strong torque back onto the disk. We argue that this torque may be responsible for the observed disruption of the clockwise disk of young stars in the Galactic center, and show in numerical experiments that it produces the observed features in the distribution of the stars’ angular momenta. More generally, we speculate that the rotation of nuclear star clusters has a stabilizing effect on the orientation of transient massive accretion disks around the supermassive black holes residing in their centers, and thus on the directions and magnitudes of the black hole spins.

<title>Synchrotron Polarization of a Hybrid Distribution of Relativistic Thermal and Nonthermal Electrons in Gamma-Ray Burst Prompt Emission</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Synchrotron polarization of relativistic nonthermal electrons in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been widely studied. However, recent numerical simulations of relativistic shocks and magnetic reconnection have found that a more realistic electron distribution consists of a power-law component plus a thermal component, which requires observational validation. In this paper, we investigate synchrotron polarization using a hybrid energy distribution of relativistic thermal and nonthermal electrons within a globally toroidal magnetic field in GRB prompt emission. Our results show that compared to the case of solely nonthermal electrons, the synchrotron polarization degrees (PDs) in these hybrid electrons can vary widely, depending on different parameters, and that the PD decreases progressively with frequency in the gamma-ray, X-ray, and optical bands. The time-averaged PD spectrum displays a significant bump in the gamma-ray and X-ray bands, with the PDs higher than ∼60% if the thermal peak energy of the electrons is much smaller than the conjunctive energy of the electrons between the thermal and nonthermal distributions. The high-synchrotron PDs (≳60%) in the gamma-ray and X-ray bands, which generally cannot be produced by solely nonthermal electrons with typical power-law slopes, can be achieved by hybrid electrons and primarily originates from the exponential decay part of the thermal component. Moreover, this model can roughly explain the PDs and spectral properties of some GRBs, where GRB 110301A with a high PD ( ) may be potential evidence for the existence of relativistic thermal electrons.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have used solar oscillation frequencies and frequency splittings obtained over solar cycles 23 and 24 and the rising phase of solar cycle 25 to investigate whether the tachocline properties (the change in the rotation rate across the tachocline. i.e., the jump, the width, and the position) show any time variation. We confirm that the change in rotation rate across the tachocline changes substantially; however, the change does not show a simple correlation with solar cycle unlike, for instance, changes in mode frequencies. The change during the ascending phase of solar cycle 25 is almost a mirror image of the change during the descending part of solar cycle 24, tempting us to speculate that the tachocline has a much longer period than either the sunspot or the magnetic cycle. We also find that the position of the tachocline, defined as the midpoint of the change in rotation rate, showed significant changes during solar cycle 24. The width of the tachocline, on the other hand, has shown significant changes during solar cycle 23 but not later. The change in the tachocline becomes more visible if we look at the upper and lower extents of the tachocline, defined as (position ± width). We find that for epochs around solar maxima and minima, the extent decreases before increasing again—a few more years of data should clarify this trend. Our results reinforce the need to continue helioseismic monitoring of the Sun to understand solar activity and its evolution.

<title>Alleviating H 0 and S 8 Tensions Simultaneously in K-essence Cosmology</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The present work begins by examining the early-Universe inflationary epoch of a special K-essence model, which incorporates a linear coupling term between the scalar field potential and the canonical Lagrangian. For the power-law potential, we both numerically and analytically prove that the inflationary parameters such as the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio are compatible with the recent BICEP/Keck observations. Continuing this work, our analysis based on comparing early-Universe observations with late-Universe measurements indicates that the tension on the Hubble parameter H0 and the growth of structure parameter S8 can be alleviated simultaneously. More precisely, compared to the standard ΛCDM model, our model can reduce H0 tension to roughly 2.2σ, and the S8 discrepancy diminishes to 0.82σ.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Neutron monitors (NMs) are large ground-based detectors of atmospheric secondary particles, mostly neutrons, from primary cosmic rays. Their sky direction and rigidity imply a well-defined incoming (asymptotic) direction in space. From 2015 December 16 to 2017 January 8, 6 of the 18 NM counters had been transferred from McMurdo to Jang Bogo, both in Antarctica, so data from similar detectors were recorded simultaneously at these two nearby NM stations. Autocorrelations of these NM count rates are well fit as the sum of three components: an exponential function and a cosine with a period of 1 day, both centered at zero lag, plus a constant. Fitting the cross correlation of the two count rates, the functions are no longer centered at zero lag. The best-fit cosine phase is at time lag −160.22 ± 0.12 minutes. Calculating cosmic-ray trajectories in Earth's magnetic field throughout the time interval, the mean difference in response-weighted asymptotic longitudes corresponds to time lag −169.41 ± 0.31 minutes, in close agreement with the observed lag. Thus, the cosine term is consistent with and provides a technique to cleanly measure the cosmic-ray anisotropy. In contrast, the peak term shows a time lag of –14.55 minutes, much closer to the –9.60 minutes lag in rotation due to the difference in geographic longitude. We find a similar behavior in the correlations between other pairs of stations. We propose that rapid fluctuations in the counting rate may be primarily due to cosmic-ray particles of very high energy.

It is well known that there is a time lag between the solar activity and the galactic cosmic-ray flux. How to accurately describe this delay is the key problem in making precise predictions of cosmic-ray flux. In this work, a response function in convolution is first used to describe the relative contribution of the solar wind blowout at earlier times to the current flux (the origin of time lag), and its explicit profile is obtained by our 3D time-dependent numerical model. It is found that our response function is superior to other functions in accounting for the time lag effect, and its rigidity and physical process dependence are studied thoroughly. At last, this description is partly demonstrated by a simplified derivation based on the underling physical processes.

<title>Detection of the Extended γ-Ray Emission from the New Supernova Remnant G321.3–3.9 with Fermi-LAT</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
With the 15 yr of Pass 8 data recorded by the Fermi Large Area Telescope, we report the detection of an extended gigaelectronvolt emission component with a 68% containment radius of 0.°85, which is spatially associated with the newly identified supernova remnant (SNR) G321.3–3.9. The γ-ray spectrum is best described by a log-parabola model in the energy range of 100 MeV–1 TeV, which shows a significant spectral curvature at ∼1 GeV. Either a leptonic or a hadronic model could explain the multiwavelength data of G321.3–3.9, while the leptonic model predicts a too-low strength of magnetic field. Also considering the flat radio spectrum of G321.3–3.9 and the γ-ray upper limit in the low energy band, the hadronic model is favored. The spatial coincidence between the γ-ray morphology and the diffuse thermal X-ray emission of G321.3–3.9 and the curved gigaelectronvolt γ-ray spectrum make G321.3–3.9 similar to the typical middle-aged SNRs interacting with molecular clouds (MCs). Such characteristics provide further evidence of the potential hadronic origin for its γ-ray emission. However, there is no MC detected around G321.3–3.9, which challenges the hadronic model.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present 102 embedded young stellar object (YSO) candidates associated with the H72.97-69.39 super star cluster (SSC) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). With the use of the James Webb Space Telescope Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) imaging mode, we utilize an F770W – F1000W versus F1000W color–magnitude diagram to select 70 YSO candidates. An additional 27 YSO candidates are selected based on model fitting using the four MIRI imaging filters employed for this study (F770W, F1000W, F1500W, and F2100W). The central region of H72.97-69.39 is saturated in MIRI imaging, however it is covered by observations made with the Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS), leading to the identification of five additional massive YSOs. The total star formation rate inferred based on the 102 YSO candidates is 0.02 M⊙ yr−1, similar to other high-mass star-forming regions in the LMC which have undergone several generations of starburst events. Due to its young age, however, H72.97-69.39's stellar production rate is expected to increase. The central five YSOs identified with MRS have masses ranging from 21.1 to 40.3 M⊙ and total luminosity over 106L⊙, making H72.97-69.39 a very compact and luminous star-forming region similar to other known SSCs. We theorize that the central five massive YSOs were formed via filamentary collision, while other YSO candidates of varying masses were triggered by wind, radiation, and expanding H ii shells based on their spatial distribution.

总结:
研究通过MAESTROeX模拟热核氦点燃在氢丰富壳层下的演化过程。发现对流区的增长是由于渗透的流体元素冷却了上方的辐射层，而非对流区本身熵值的增加。同时，这些流动有效地混合了成分，将碳带出对流区，并在接触氢壳层之前将质子带入对流区。这些发现对未来这类事件的建模和观测具有重要的意义。 <div>
We perform the first multidimensional fluid simulations of thermonuclear helium ignition underneath a hydrogen-rich shell. This situation is relevant to Type I X-ray bursts on neutron stars that accrete from a hydrogen-rich companion. Using the low-Mach number fluid code MAESTROeX, we investigate the growth of the convection zone due to nuclear burning, and the evolution of the chemical abundances in the atmosphere of the star. We also examine the convective boundary mixing processes that cause the evolution to differ significantly from previous one-dimensional simulations that rely on mixing-length theory. We find that the convection zone grows outward as penetrating fluid elements cool the overlying radiative layer, rather than directly from the increasing entropy of the convection zone itself. Simultaneously, these flows efficiently mix composition, carrying carbon out of and protons into the convection zone even before contact with the hydrogen shell. We discuss the implications of these effects for future modeling of these events and observations.

Molecular hydrogen (H2) formation and dissociation are key processes that drive the gas life cycle in galaxies. Using the SImulating the LifeCycle of Molecular Clouds zoom-in simulation suite, we explore the utility of future observations of H2 dissociation and formation for tracking the life cycle of molecular clouds. The simulations used in this work include nonequilibrium H2 formation, stellar radiation, sink particles, and turbulence. We find that at early times in the cloud evolution H2 formation rapidly outpaces dissociation and molecular clouds build their mass from the atomic reservoir in their environment. Rapid H2 formation is also associated with a higher early star formation rate. For the clouds studied here, H2 is strongly out of chemical equilibrium during the early stages of cloud formation but settles into a bursty chemical steady state about 2 Myr after the first stars form. At the latest stage of cloud evolution, dissociation outweighs formation and the clouds enter a dispersal phase. We discuss how theories of the molecular cloud life cycle and star formation efficiency may be distinguished with observational measurements of H2 fluorescence with a space-based high-resolution far-UV spectrometer, such as the proposed Hyperion and Eos NASA Explorer missions. Such missions would enable measurements of the H2 dissociation and formation rates, which we demonstrate can be connected to different phases in a molecular cloud’s star-forming life, including cloud building, rapidly star forming, H2 chemical equilibrium, and cloud destruction.

这篇文章评估了线性混合近似（LMA）在天王星和海王星内部压力-温度条件下的适用性。通过从头计算的分子动力学模拟，考虑了纯水、纯硅和1:1以及1:4的硅-水分子比例，温度为3000K，压力在30至600 GPa之间。研究发现，在约150至600 GPa范围内，LMA的精度在几个百分点内（<5%）。岩石的存在会延迟1:4的硅-水混合物的超离子水转变约70 GPa。最后，研究指出电子理论（泛函）的选择会影响EOS，并在密度方面引入约10%的不确定性。我们的研究表明，在行星条件下相图的复杂性，并对岩石-水混合物及其对推断得出的行星组成的影响需要更好地理解。 
<br /><br />总结: 分子动力学模拟显示LMA在一定压力范围内适用，岩石的存在会影响超离子水的转变压力，电子理论的选择会影响EOS并引入不确定性。 <div>
The linear mixing approximation (LMA) is often used in planetary models for calculating the equations of state (EOS) of mixtures. A commonly assumed planetary composition is a mixture of rock and water. Here we assess the accuracy of the LMA for pressure–temperature conditions relevant to the interiors of Uranus and Neptune. We perform molecular dynamics simulations using ab initio simulations and consider pure water, pure silica, and 1:1 and 1:4 silica–water molecular fractions at a temperature of 3000 K and pressures between 30 and 600 GPa. We find that the LMA is valid within a few percent (< ∼5%) between ∼150 and 600 Gpa, where the sign of the difference in inferred density depends on the specific composition of the mixture. We also show that the presence of rocks delays the transition to superionic water by ∼70 GPa for the 1:4 silica–water mixture. Finally, we note that the choice of electronic theory (functionals) affects the EOS and introduces an uncertainty of the order of 10% in density. Our study demonstrates the complexity of phase diagrams in planetary conditions and the need for a better understanding of rock–water mixtures and their effect on the inferred planetary composition.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章报告了对超新星遗迹B0453–685中脉冲星风星云（PWN）的多波段观测结果。研究表明，观测到的伽马射线很可能来自PWN，也可能存在脉冲星成分。通过Parkes射电和NuSTAR X射线观测，对PWN进行了约束，得到了PWN的硬X射线光谱参数，并将结果纳入现有的宽带模型中。此外，对NuSTAR观测中的脉冲进行了搜索，得到了硬X射线脉冲分数的上限。最后，研究还发现了一个新的高质量X射线双星候选体。 <div>
Gamma-ray emission is observed coincident in position to the evolved, composite supernova remnant (SNR) B0453–685. Prior multiwavelength investigations of the region indicate that the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) within the SNR is the most likely origin for the observed gamma rays, with a possible pulsar contribution that becomes significant at energies below E ∼ 5 GeV. Constraints on the PWN hard X-ray spectrum are important for the most accurate broadband representation of PWN emission and determining the presence of a gamma-ray pulsar component. The results of Parkes radio and Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) X-ray observations are presented on PWN B0453–685. We perform a search for the central pulsar in the new Parkes radio data, finding an upper limit of 12 μJy. A pulsation search in the new NuSTAR observations additionally provides a 3σ upper limit on the hard X-ray pulsed fraction of 56%. The PWN is best characterized with a photon index ΓX = 1.91 ± 0.20 in the 3–78 keV NuSTAR data, and the results are incorporated into existing broadband models. Last, we characterize a serendipitous source detected by Chandra and NuSTAR that is considered a new high-mass X-ray binary candidate.

We present 3D hydrodynamical simulations of core convection with a stably stratified envelope of a 25 M⊙ star in the early phase of the main sequence. We use the explicit gas-dynamics code PPMstar, which tracks two fluids and includes radiation pressure and radiative diffusion. Multiple series of simulations with different luminosities and radiative thermal conductivities are presented. The entrainment rate at the convective boundary, internal gravity waves in and above the boundary region, and the approach to dynamical equilibrium shortly after a few convective turnovers are investigated. We perform very long simulations on 8963 grids accelerated by luminosity boost factors of 1000, 3162 and 10,000. In these simulations, the growing penetrative convection reduces the initially unrealistically large entrainment. This reduction is enabled by a spatial separation that develops between the entropy gradient and the composition gradient. The convective boundary moves outward much more slowly at the end of these simulations. Finally, we present a 1D method to predict the extent and character of penetrative convection beyond the Schwarzschild boundary. The 1D model is based on a spherically averaged reduced entropy equation that takes the turbulent dissipation as input from the 3D hydrodynamic simulation and takes buoyancy and all other energy sources and sinks into account. This 1D method is intended to be ultimately deployed in 1D stellar evolution calculations and is based on the properties of penetrative convection in our simulations carried forward through the local thermal timescale.

<div> 47 Tuc, multimass equilibrium dynamical models, pulsar timing data, Milky Way globular clusters, mass distribution

这篇文章介绍了一种新的方法，结合多质量平衡动力学模型和脉冲星定时数据，以限制银河系球状星团（GCs）的质量分布和遗留物群。首先应用该方法到47 Tuc，一个有丰富的恒星动力学数据，也有大量毫秒脉冲星的星团。我们证明脉冲星定时数据甚至在没有恒星动力学拟合的情况下也可以对整体质量分布和遗留物群施加强大约束。我们的模型支持该星团中存在少量恒星质量黑洞（BHs）（总质量为），并且认为不需要存在大型（>2000 M⊙）的中等质量BH。然后我们将该方法应用到Terzan 5，一个有很大毫秒脉冲星群的严重阻挡的星团，该星团的常规恒星动力学数据非常有限。我们改善了对该星团质量分布和结构参数的现有约束，并对其黑洞含量施加了严格的约束，得出了对BH的质量的上限在∼4000 M⊙。这种方法即使在缺乏恒星动力学数据的情况下也可以探索GCs的中心动态，并且可以很容易地应用于其他具有脉冲星定时数据的GCs，随着下一代射电望远镜的数据集不断增长。 <br /><br />总结: 介绍了一种结合多质量平衡动力学模型和脉冲星定时数据的新方法，用于限制银河系球状星团（GCs）的质量分布和遗留物群。首先用于47 Tuc和Terzan 5两个星团，证明了即使在缺乏恒星动力学数据的情况下也可以探索GCs的中心动态，并对黑洞含量施加严格的约束。 <div>
We present a new method to combine multimass equilibrium dynamical models and pulsar timing data to constrain the mass distribution and remnant populations of Milky Way globular clusters (GCs). We first apply this method to 47 Tuc, a cluster for which there exists an abundance of stellar kinematic data and which is also host to a large population of millisecond pulsars. We demonstrate that the pulsar timing data allow us to place strong constraints on the overall mass distribution and remnant populations even without fitting on stellar kinematics. Our models favor a small population of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) in this cluster (with a total mass of ), arguing against the need for a large (>2000 M⊙) central intermediate-mass BH. We then apply the method to Terzan 5, a heavily obscured bulge cluster that hosts the largest population of millisecond pulsars of any Milky Way GC and for which the collection of conventional stellar kinematic data is very limited. We improve existing constraints on the mass distribution and structural parameters of this cluster and place stringent constraints on its black hole content, finding an upper limit on the mass in BHs of ∼4000 M⊙. This method allows us to probe the central dynamics of GCs even in the absence of stellar kinematic data and can be easily applied to other GCs with pulsar timing data, for which data sets will continue to grow with the next generation of radio telescopes.

<div> 关键词: SOFIA HAWC+, RCW 36, 磁场, 恒星反馈, 气体动力学
总结:
SOFIA HAWC+ 数据用于研究高质量星形成区RCW 36中磁场与恒星反馈之间的相互作用。采用HRO方法量化磁场与各种观测数据中的结构相对取向关系，并发现在密度较高的区域中，气体结构更倾向于垂直于磁场排列，而在光解区中倾向于平行排列。这表明磁场在RCW 36形成时对气体流动方向起到了重要作用，而在PDR区域，反馈效应可能支配磁场，使其几何形状发生变化。 <div>
We use polarization data from SOFIA HAWC+ to investigate the interplay between magnetic fields and stellar feedback in altering gas dynamics within the high-mass star-forming region RCW 36, located in Vela C. This region is of particular interest as it has a bipolar H ii region powered by a massive star cluster, which may be impacting the surrounding magnetic field. To determine if this is the case, we apply the histogram of relative orientations (HRO) method to quantify the relative alignment between the inferred magnetic field and elongated structures observed in several data sets such as dust emission, column density, temperature, and spectral line intensity maps. The HRO results indicate a bimodal alignment trend, where structures observed with dense gas tracers show a statistically significant preference for perpendicular alignment relative to the magnetic field, while structures probed by the photodissociation region (PDR) tracers tend to align preferentially parallel relative to the magnetic field. Moreover, the dense gas and PDR associated structures are found to be kinematically distinct such that a bimodal alignment trend is also observed as a function of line-of-sight velocity. This suggests that the magnetic field may have been dynamically important and set a preferred direction of gas flow at the time that RCW 36 formed, resulting in a dense ridge developing perpendicular to the magnetic field. However, on filament scales near the PDR region, feedback may be energetically dominating the magnetic field, warping its geometry and the associated flux-frozen gas structures, causing the observed preference for parallel relative alignment.

<div> Palomar 14, outer halo, globular cluster, N-body calculations, dwarf galaxy<br />
总结:<br />这篇文章使用直接N体计算模拟了Pal 14的演化过程，假设它起源于一个与MW脱离或解体的矮星系，在那里演化了2-3亿年，然后被MW所俘获。研究表明，Pal 14在MW中扩展并最终达到适当的质量和大小，在模拟中成功复现了观测到的质量函数。模拟结果表明，Pal 14可能是在一个具有高度原始质量分离的矮星系中形成的，其初始半质量半径为7 pc，质量为8 < M/104 < 10 M⊙。 <div>
We examine a new scenario to model the outer halo globular cluster (GC) Palomar 14 (Pal 14) over its lifetime by performing a comprehensive set of direct N-body calculations. We assume Pal 14 was born in a now detached/disrupted dwarf galaxy with a strong tidal field. Pal 14 evolved there until the slope of the stellar mass function (MF) became close to the measured value, which is observed to be significantly shallower than in most GCs. After about 2–3 Gyr, Pal 14 was then captured by the Milky Way (MW). Although the physical size of such a cluster is indistinguishable from a cluster that has lived its entire life in the MW, other parameters like its mass and the MF slope, strongly depend on the time the cluster is taken from the dwarf galaxy. After being captured by the MW on a new orbit, the cluster expands and eventually reaches the appropriate mass and size of Pal 14 after 11.5 Gyr while reproducing the observed MF. These simulations thus suggest that Pal 14 may have formed in a dwarf galaxy with a post-gas expulsion initial half-mass radius and mass of rh = 7 pc and 8 < M/104 < 10 M⊙, respectively, with a high degree of primordial mass segregation.

The presence of dual active galactic nuclei (AGNs) on scales of a few tens of kiloparsecs can be used to study merger-induced accretion on supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and offer insights about SMBH mergers, using dual AGNs as merger precursors. This study uses the Romulus25 cosmological simulation to investigate the properties and evolution of dual AGNs. We first analyze the properties of AGNs (Lbol > 1043 erg s−1) and their neighboring SMBHs (any SMBHs closer than 30 pkpc to an AGN) at z ≤ 2. This is our underlying population. We then applied the luminosity threshold of Lbol > 1043 erg s−1 to the neighboring SMBHs thereby identifying dual and multiple AGNs. Our findings indicate an increase in the number of both single and dual AGNs from lower to higher redshifts. We also find that the number of dual AGNs with separations of 0.5–4 kpc is twice the number of duals with separations of 4–30 kpc. All dual AGNs in our sample resulted from major mergers. Compared to single AGNs, duals have a lower black hole-to-halo mass ratio. We found that the properties of dual AGN host halos, including halo mass, stellar mass, star formation rate, and gas mass, are generally consistent with those of single AGN halos, albeit tending toward the higher end of their respective property ranges. Our analysis uncovered a diverse array of evolutionary patterns among dual AGNs, including rapidly evolving systems, slower ones, and instances where SMBH mergers are ineffective.

总结:
本研究分析了在0.14 ≲ z ≲ 0.73范围内由H i选择的吸收者的O vi含量和动力学特征，并确定了它们冷光电离相的金属丰度。研究将吸收者分为100个强Lyα森林系统（SLFSs）和26个部分Lyman限制系统（pLLSs）。O vi检测率在低金属量和高金属量的SLFSs之间存在显著差异。我们发现O vi柱密度与金属丰度之间存在强相关性。最强和最宽的O vi吸收者几乎总是与HM吸收者相关联，而较弱的O vi吸收者则既出现在LM吸收者，也出现在HM吸收者。通过与星系选择和盲目O vi调查的比较，我们得出结论：具有 (O vi) ≳ 14的吸收者很可能起源于正在形成恒星的星系的CGM。具有弱O vi的吸收者可能追踪着扩展的CGM或星系间介质，而没有O vi的吸收者可能起源于星系间介质。 <br /><br /> <div>
We analyze the O vi content and kinematics for 126 H i-selected absorbers at 0.14 ≲ z ≲ 0.73 for which the metallicities of their cool photoionized phase have been determined. We separate the absorbers into 100 strong Lyα forest systems (SLFSs with 15 ≲ log N(H i) < 16.2) and 26 partial Lyman Limit systems (pLLSs with 16.2 ≤ log N(H i) ≤ 17.2). The sample is drawn from the COS CGM Compendium (CCC) and has O vi coverage in signal-to-noise ratio ≥ 8 Hubble Space Telescope/COS G130M/G160M QSO spectra, yielding a 2σ completeness level of (O vi) ≥ 13.6. The O vi detection rates differ substantially between low-metallicity (LM; [X/H] ≤ −1.4) and high-metallicity (HM; [X/H] > −1.4) SLFSs, with 20% and 60% detection rates, respectively. The O vi detection frequency for the HM and LM pLLSs is, however, similar at ∼60%. The SLFSs and pLLSs without detected O vi are consistent with the absorbing gas being in a single phase, while those with O vi trace multiphase gas. We show that the O vi velocity widths and column densities have different distributions in LM and HM gas. We find a strong correlation between O vi column density and metallicity. The strongest ( (O vi) ≳ 14) and broadest O vi absorbers are nearly always associated with HM absorbers, while weaker O vi absorbers are found in both LM and HM absorbers. From comparisons with galaxy-selected and blind O vi surveys, we conclude absorbers with (O vi) ≳ 14 most likely arise in the CGM of star-forming galaxies. Absorbers with weak O vi likely trace the extended CGM or intergalactic medium, while those without O vi likely originate in the intergalactic medium.

High-velocity outflows are ubiquitous in compact, massive (M* ∼ 1011M⊙), z ∼ 0.5 galaxies with extreme star formation surface densities (ΣSFR ∼ 2000 M⊙ yr−1 kpc−2). We have previously detected and characterized these outflows using Mg ii absorption lines. To probe their full extent, we present Keck/KCWI integral field spectroscopy of the [O ii] and Mg ii emission nebulae surrounding all of the 12 galaxies in this study. We find that [O ii] is more effective than Mg ii in tracing low surface brightness, extended emission in these galaxies. The [O ii] nebulae are spatially extended beyond the stars, with radial extent R90 between 10 and 40 kpc. The nebulae exhibit nongravitational motions, indicating galactic outflows with maximum blueshifted velocities ranging from −335 to −1920 km s−1. The outflow kinematics correlate with the bursty star formation histories of these galaxies. Galaxies with the most recent bursts of star formation (within the last <3 Myr) exhibit the highest central velocity dispersions (σ ≳ 400 km s−1), while the oldest bursts have the lowest-velocity outflows. Many galaxies exhibit both high-velocity cores and more extended, slower-moving gas indicative of multiple outflow episodes. The slower, larger outflows occurred earlier and have decelerated as they propagate into the circumgalactic medium and mix on timescales ≳50 Myr.

总结:
本研究针对位于银河系中心超大质量黑洞Sgr A*附近的IRS 1W的N源区域进行了研究，发现N源中有大部分呈现出北西飞行角。这些源可能受到中等质量黑洞(IMBH)的束缚，或者观测到的浓集现象是由于沿视线的盘状分布投影。研究还发现N源在H、Ks和波段中可被探测到，这些向西北飞行的源可能是一群束缚的星体。研究讨论了有无IMBH或倾斜的盘状分布来解释这些恒星的显著过密现象。首先的情形暗示了假定的IMBH的下限质量约为10^4太阳质量。我们的测量首次揭示了包含IRS 1W的恒星集合是一群大质量、年轻的恒星。这个恒星集合可能是目前朝向Sgr A*的潮汐剥离的巨大恒星团的残余核心。第二个情形表明，N源的出现可能受到年轻的He星和/或被尘埃包围的星体的盘状分布投影的影响。 <div>
We focus on a sample of 42 sources in the vicinity of the bow-shock source IRS 1W (N-source region), located at a distance of 6.″05 northeast of the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), within the radius of 1.″35. We present the first proper-motion measurements of N sources and find that a larger subset of N sources (28 sources) exhibit a north–west (NW) flying angle. These sources can be bound by an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) or the concentration that we observe is due to a disk-like distribution projection along the line of sight. We detect the N sources in the H, Ks, and bands. The NW-ward flying sources could be a bound collection of stars. We discuss the tentative existence of an IMBH or an inclined disk distribution to explain the significant overdensity of stars. The first scenario of having an IMBH implies the lower limit of ∼104M⊙ for the putative IMBH. Our measurements for the first time reveal that the dense association of stars containing IRS 1W is a comoving group of massive, young stars. This stellar association might be the remnant core of a massive stellar cluster that is currently being tidally stripped as it inspirals toward Sgr A*. The second scenario suggests that the appearance of the N sources might be influenced by the projection of a disk-like distribution of younger He-stars and/or dust-enshrouded stars.

<br />总结:
光波的偏振可以提供有关其天体发射源和传播介质的大量信息，对天文学的各个方面都至关重要。本文展示了在天体物理学中一个重要但长期被忽视的去极化机制：当光的偏振矢量沿着非平面曲线传播时，会经历额外的旋转，特别是对于无线电波。这个过程导致去极化，我们称之为“几何”去极化（GDP）。我们对在几何光学近似下线性偏振无线电波在随机非均匀等离子体中的传输的GDP效应进行了简明的理论分析。在日冕等离子体中进行各向同性散射的情况下，我们表明通过湍动等离子体传播的线性偏振无线电波的到达角的GDP效应是不容忽视的。线性偏振无线电波的GDP效应可以推广到天体现象，如快速无线电爆和恒星无线电爆等。我们的发现可能对分析天体去极化现象产生深远影响。 <div>
Polarization of electromagnetic waves carries a large amount of information about their astrophysical emitters and the media they passed through, and hence is crucial in various aspects of astronomy. Here we demonstrate an important but long-overlooked depolarization mechanism in astrophysics: when the polarization vector of light travels along a nonplanar curve, it experiences an additional rotation, in particular for radio waves. The process leads to depolarization, which we call “geometric” depolarization (GDP). We give a concise theoretical analysis of the GDP effect on the transport of radio waves in a randomly inhomogeneous plasma under the geometrical optics approximation. In the case of isotropic scattering in the coronal plasma, we show that the GDP of the angle of arrival of the linearly polarized radio waves propagating through the turbulent plasma cannot be ignored. The GDP effect of linearly polarized radio waves can be generalized to astrophysical phenomena, such as fast radio bursts and stellar radio bursts, etc. Our findings may have a profound impact on the analysis of astrophysical depolarization phenomena.

总结: 本文研究了12C+12C核反应速率和其分支比对白矮星祖先的演化影响，发现分支比的不确定性是确定超巨星内部组成的主要因素。新的分支比会导致超巨白矮星核心中20Ne的中心丰度差异最多为17%，这将导致冷却时间和晶化核心尺寸的差异。然而，这对于脉动特性的影响很小。研究还发现，在一定质量范围内，超巨白矮星祖先的内部部分发生碳燃烧，形成混合的CONe-核心组合，这与纯CO核心的天体演化有显著差异。晶化核心尺寸和冷却时间的差异导致了周期间距分布的不同模式。 <div>
Recent determinations of the total rate of the 12C+12C nuclear reaction show non-negligible differences with the reference reaction rate commonly used in previous stellar simulations. In addition, the current uncertainties in determining each exit channel constitute one of the main uncertainties in shaping the inner structure of super asymptotic giant branch stars that could have a measurable impact on the properties of pulsating ultramassive white dwarfs (WDs). We explore how new determinations of the nuclear reaction rate and its branching ratios affect the evolution of WD progenitors. We show that the current uncertainties in the branching ratios constitute the main uncertainty factor in determining the inner composition of ultramassive WDs and their progenitors. We found that the use of extreme branching ratios leads to differences in the central abundances of 20Ne of at most 17%, which are translated into differences of at most 1.3% and 0.8% in the cooling times and size of the crystallized core, respectively. However, the impact on the pulsation properties is small, less than 1 s for the asymptotic period spacing. We found that the carbon burns partially in the interior of ultramassive WD progenitors within a particular range of masses, leaving a hybrid CONe-core composition in their cores. The evolution of these new kinds of predicted objects differs substantially from the evolution of objects with pure CO cores. Differences in the size of the crystallized core and cooling times of up to 15% and 6%, respectively, lead to distinct patterns in the period spacing distribution.

Studying the magnetic field properties on the solar surface is crucial for understanding the solar and heliospheric activities, which in turn shape space weather in the solar system. Surface flux transport (SFT) modeling helps us to simulate and analyze the transport and evolution of magnetic flux on the solar surface, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms responsible for solar activity. In this work, we demonstrate the use of machine learning techniques in solving magnetic flux transport, making it accurate. We have developed a novel physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based model to study the evolution of bipolar magnetic regions using SFT in one-dimensional azimuthally averaged and also in two dimensions. We demonstrate the efficiency and computational feasibility of our PINN-based model by comparing its performance and accuracy with that of a numerical model implemented using the Runge–Kutta implicit–explicit scheme. The mesh-independent PINN method can be used to reproduce the observed polar magnetic field with better flux conservation. This advancement is important for accurately reproducing observed polar magnetic fields, thereby providing insights into the strength of future solar cycles. This work paves the way for more efficient and accurate simulations of solar magnetic flux transport and showcases the applicability of PINNs in solving advection–diffusion equations with a particular focus on heliophysics.

总结:<br /><br />研究使用IXPE和NuSTAR观测了新发现的黑洞X射线双星Swift J151857.0-572147的光谱偏振特性。通过IXPE数据分析，采用模型无关方法报告了首次检测到的X射线偏振度(PD)为1.34 ± 0.27和偏振角(PA)为-13.°69 ± 5.°85；而模型相关的分析得到的PD为1.18±0.23和PA为-14.°01±5.°80。联合光谱分析和NuSTAR单独分析限制了中心BH质量约为9.2 ± 1.6至10.1 ± 1.7M⊙，自旋参数约为0.6 ± 0.1至0.7 ± 0.2，盘倾角约为35° ± 7°至46° ± 15°。辐射指数和截止能量分别为2.19 ± 0.03至2.47 ± 0.06和36 ± 4至78 ± 10 keV，表明了软谱状态的转变。<br />此外，相对较小的外部辐射区大小和较低的质量流出率，以及最佳契合的晕尺寸较小，低于盘吸积速率，进一步证实了相同的状态。在软状态下检测到的低PD可能是由于在密集的辐射区内的重复散射所致，并且来自盘的主要发射与低自旋和低盘倾角相一致。拟合得到的氢柱密度相对较高，约为4-5×1022cm−2。 <div>
We study the spectropolarimetric properties of a newly discovered black hole (BH) X-ray binary Swift J151857.0-572147 jointly using Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) and NuSTAR observations during 2024 March. The analysis of IXPE data reports the first detection of X-ray with a polarization degree (PD) of 1.34 ± 0.27 and a polarization angle (PA) of −13.°69 ± 5.°85 using a model-independent approach, while the model-dependent analysis gives a PD of 1.18 ± 0.23 and a PA of −14.°01 ± 5.°80. The joint spectral analysis of the broadband data and NuSTAR analysis in isolation constrain the mass of the central BH between ∼9.2 ± 1.6 and 10.1 ± 1.7M⊙ and a moderate spin parameter of ∼0.6 ± 0.1–0.7 ± 0.2 with a disk inclination of ∼35° ± 7°–46° ± 15°. The power-law photon index and cutoff energy are 2.19 ± 0.03–2.47 ± 0.06 and ∼36 ± 4–78 ± 10 keV, suggesting a transition to the soft spectral state. Additionally, a relatively lower corona size of 6 ± 1–9 ± 2rS, a low mass outflow rate ( ), and the best-fitted halo accretion is less compared to the disk accretion rate further confirm the same state. The low PD detected in the soft state can be due to repeated scattering inside the dense corona, and the dominant emission from the disk agrees with the low spin and low disk inclination. The hydrogen column density obtained from the fit is relatively high at ∼4–5 × 1022 cm−2.

<div> M-dwarf hosts, habitable zone, tidal effects, spin synchronization, Cassini State 2 (CS2)<br />
<br />总结:<br />针对M型矮星宿主的温带外行星，由于其与恒星的适居带接近，需要仔细考虑潮汐效应。研究发现，75%的M型矮星周围探测到的行星可能被激发到高倾角，并在随后的潮汐耗散过程中保持稳定。对于在CS2与宿主恒星适居带内的许多行星来说，潮汐状态的潜在捕获对于理解银河系中最常见的温带行星非常重要。 <div>
For temperate exoplanets orbiting M-dwarf hosts, the proximity of the habitable zone to the star necessitates careful consideration of tidal effects. Spin synchronization of the planetary orbital period and rotation period, tidal locking, and the subsequent impact on surface conditions frames common assumptions about M-dwarf planets. We investigate the plausibility of capture into Cassini State 2 (CS2) for a known sample of 280 multiplanet systems orbiting M-dwarf hosts. This resonance of the spin precession and orbital precession frequencies can excite planets into stable nonzero rotational obliquities, breaking tidal locking and inducing a version of “day” and “night.” Considering each planetary pair and estimating the spin and orbital precession frequencies, we find that 75% of detected planets orbiting M dwarfs may be plausibly excited to a high obliquity and maintain it through subsequent tidal dissipation over long timescales. We also investigate two possible mechanisms for capture into CS2: quantifying the orbital migration or primordial obliquity necessary for CS2. We find orbital migrations by a factor of ≲2 and an isotropic initial spin distribution can produce high-obliquity planets, aligning with similar findings for planets orbiting close-in to FGK dwarfs. Many of the planets in our sample reside in both CS2 and within their stellar habitable zone. Over half of the planets with Teq < 400 K around host stars with Teff < 3000 K could possess nonzero obliquity due to residence in CS2. This overlap renders the potential capture into Cassini States extremely relevant to understanding the galaxy’s most common temperate planets.

Binary stars are responsible for many unusual astrophysical phenomena, including some important explosive cosmic events. The stability criteria for rapid mass transfer and common-envelope evolution are fundamental to binary star evolution. They determine the mass, mass ratio, and orbital distribution of systems such as X-ray binaries and merging gravitational-wave sources. We use our adiabatic mass-loss model to systematically survey metal-poor and solar-metallicity donor thresholds for dynamical timescale mass transfer. The critical mass ratios qad are systematically explored and the impact of metallicity and nonconservative mass transfer are studied. For metal-poor radiative-envelope donors, qad are smaller than those for solar-metallicity stars at the same evolutionary stage. However, qad do the opposite for convective-envelope donors. Nonconservative mass transfer significantly decreases qad for massive donors. This is because it matters how conservative mass transfer is during the thermal timescale phase immediately preceding a delayed dynamical mass transfer. We apply our theoretical predictions to observed high-mass X-ray binaries that have overfilled their Roche lobes and find a good agreement with their mass ratios. Our results can be applied to study individual binary objects or large samples of binary objects with binary population synthesis codes.

<br />
本文讨论了恒星模型显示，星球的核心压缩度并不随着恒星质量单调增加。相反，在碳氧核心质量范围内，核心压缩度急剧下降；这个范围可能对恒星的金属丰度和演化历史有一定敏感性。这种压缩度下降的恒星预计会经历超新星爆发，留下中子星，而在此范围的两侧的恒星预计会形成黑洞。这导致了一个假设质量范围，其中黑洞很少形成。这些模型定量地预测，当应用于双星剥离恒星时，预计几乎没有组分质量为10M⊙–15M⊙的双黑洞。但是，第三次引力波瞬变目录的数据显示，我们没有找到这一现象的证据。如果这个间隙在自然界中确实存在，我们认为在当前（第四次）LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA观测运行结束时很难解决这个问题。
<br /><br />总结: 本文讨论了恒星模型对星球核心压缩度的影响，以及它对星际超新星和黑洞形成的影响。同时指出了引力波信号中可能存在的质量间隙，但最后指出目前难以通过观测解决这个问题。 <div>
Stellar models indicate that the core compactness of a star, which is a common proxy for its explodability in a supernova, does not increase monotonically with the star’s mass. Rather, the core compactness dips sharply over a range of carbon–oxygen core masses; this range may be somewhat sensitive to the star’s metallicity and evolutionary history. Stars in this compactness dip are expected to experience supernovae leaving behind neutron stars, whereas stars on either side of this range are expected to form black holes. This results in a hypothetical mass range in which black holes should seldom form. Quantitatively, when applied to binary stripped stars, these models predict a dearth of binary black holes with component masses ≈10M⊙–15M⊙. The population of gravitational-wave signals indicates potential evidence for a dip in the distribution of chirp masses of merging binary black holes near ≈10M⊙–12M⊙. This feature could be linked to the hypothetical component mass gap described above, but this interpretation depends on what assumptions are made of the binaries’ mass ratios. Here, we directly probe the distribution of binary black hole component masses to look for evidence of a gap. We find no evidence for this feature using data from the third gravitational-wave transient catalog. If this gap does exist in nature, we find that it is unlikely to be resolvable by the end of the current (fourth) LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA observing run.

这篇文章研究了中高质量星形成星系（SFGs）的结构演化情景，通过比较它们的恒星质量分布和现今的恒星质量，来探讨自宇宙中期以来的演化情况。作者发现了SFGs尺寸演化速率的差异可能是由于样本选择和尺寸测量方法的变化所导致。为了验证这些因素，研究团队使用恒星质量增长历史（SMGHs）并结合星际物质主序的演化情况来追踪个体星系的演化过程，并使用IllustrisTNG模拟进行了验证。研究发现，从质量和光度角度估计的结构参数表明，质量加权的尺寸演化速率比光度加权的慢，突显了需要考虑质量与光度比（M/L）梯度。此外，观察到恒星质量分布具有质量相关的演化：大质量星系在z ≳ 1.5形成中心区域，并在外部区域增长更快，暗示了内部-外部的增长模式，而中等质量和小质量星系自z ∼ 2以来遵循相对自相似的质量堆积。此外，观察到的尺寸演化斜率与TNG50的预测相矛盾。研究团队通过半质量尺寸演化和简单的盘形成模型，发现观测到的角动量在过去的100亿年中减少了一半，而TNG50中基本保持不变。这种模拟中更高的角动量可能是由于高角动量气体的吸积所致。 <br /><br />总结：本文研究了中高质量星形成星系的结构演化情况，发现了尺寸演化速率的差异，探讨了质量到光度比对这一结果的影响。在比较质量加权和光度加权的尺寸演化之后，发现质量加权的尺寸演化速率更慢，质量较大的星系在演化过程中呈现出内部区域的形成和外部区域的快速增长，而质量较小的星系则呈现相对自相似的质量增长趋势。研究团队还观察到了与TNG50模拟结果的尺寸演化斜率的矛盾，并通过模型验证发现了观测到的角动量减少与模拟结果的差异。 <div>
We aim to discern scenarios of structural evolution of intermediate-to-high-mass star-forming galaxies (SFGs) since cosmic noon by comparing their stellar mass profiles with present-day stellar masses of . We addressed discrepancies in the size evolution rates of SFGs, which may be caused by variations in sample selection and methods for size measurements. To check these factors, we traced the evolution of individual galaxies by identifying their progenitors using stellar mass growth histories (SMGHs), integrating along the star-forming main sequence and from the IllustrisTNG simulations. Comparison between the structural parameters estimated from the mass- and light-based profiles shows that mass-weighted size evolves at a slower pace compared to light-based ones, highlighting the need to consider the mass-to-light ratio (M/L) gradients. Additionally, we observed mass-dependent growth in stellar mass profiles: massive galaxies ( ) formed central regions at z ≳ 1.5 and grew faster in outer regions, suggesting inside-out growth, while intermediate-mass and less massive SFGs followed a relatively self-similar mass buildup since z ∼ 2. Moreover, slopes of observed size evolution conflict with the predictions of TNG50 for samples selected using the same SMGHs across our redshift range. To explore the origin of this deviation, we examined changes in angular momentum (AM) retention fraction using the half-mass size evolution and employing a simple disk formation model. Assuming similar dark matter halo parameters, our calculations indicate that the AM inferred from observations halved in the past 10 Gyr while it remained relatively constant in TNG50. This higher AM in simulations may be due to the accretion of high-AM gases into disks.

Aiming to capture the formation and eruption of flux ropes (FRs) in the source active regions (ARs), we simulate the coronal magnetic field evolution of the AR 11429 employing the time-dependent magneto-friction model (TMF). The initial field is driven by electric fields that are derived from time-sequence photospheric vector magnetic field observations by invoking ad hoc assumptions. The simulated magnetic structure evolves from potential to twisted fields over the course of two days, followed by rise motion in the later evolution, depicting the formation of an FR and its slow eruption later. The magnetic configuration resembles an inverse S-sigmoidal structure, composed of the potential field enveloping the inverse J-shaped fields that are sheared past one another and a low-lying twisted field along the major polarity inversion line. To compare with observations, proxy emission maps based on averaged current density along the field lines are generated from the simulated field. These emission maps exhibit a remarkable one-to-one correspondence with the spatial characteristics in coronal extreme ultraviolet images, especially the filament trace supported by the twisted magnetic field in the southwest subregion. Further, the topological analysis of the simulated field reveals the cospatial flare ribbons with the quasi-separatrix layers, which is consistent with the standard flare models; therefore, the extent of the twist and orientation of the erupting FR is indicated to be the real scenario in this case. The TMF model simulates the coronal field evolution, correctly capturing the formation of the FR in the observed timescale and the twisted field generated from these simulations serves as the initial condition for the full MHD simulations.

Eclipsing Algol-type systems containing a δ Scuti (hereafter δ Sct) star enable precise determination of physical parameters and the investigation of stellar internal structure and evolution. We present the absolute parameters of CZ Aquarius (hereafter CZ Aqr) based on TESS data. CZ Aqr has an orbital period of 0.86275209 day, a mass ratio of 0.489 (6), and the secondary component nearly fills its Roche lobe. O − C analysis reveals a downward parabolic trend and a cyclical variation with a period of 88.2 yr. The downward parabola suggests a long-term decrease in the orbital period with = −3.09 × 10−8 days yr−1. The mass loss rate is estimated to be 4.54 × 10−9M⊙ yr−1, which is possibly due to magnetic stellar wind or a hot spot. The cyclical variation might be caused by the light travel time effect via the presence of a third body with a minimum mass of = 0.312 (21) M⊙. Additionally, there are two possible celestial bodies in a 2:7 resonance orbit around CZ Aqr. The asymmetric light curve is explained by adding a hot spot on the surface of the primary star. After removing the binary model, 26 frequencies were extracted from TESS data. Two radial modes were newly identified among three possible independent frequencies. Our results show that the eclipsing Algol-type system is composed of a δ Sct primary star and a subgiant star in a quadruple system.

In this study, utilizing data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager–Debrecen Faculae Data Catalogue, we investigated solar facula distribution over timescales much larger than the individual lifetimes of faculae. We aimed to better comprehend the behavior of the Sun’s global magnetic field, where faculae play a role as markers. (1) Along the latitudinal direction, we observed the following in the appearance of faculae. (i) Short-term periods with the Carrington rotation (27.3 days) and some of its harmonics (approximately 13.5 and 9 day periods) are identified. In the northern hemisphere, there is also a faint 7 day period. (ii) We also identified longer periods. These longer periods, approximately between 150–300 and 300–500 days, exhibit a diminishing trend from the solar equator to the poles in both hemispheres. (2) Analyzing the distribution and evolution of the longitudinal coordinates of the faculae, we identified two pairs of active longitudes that are separated by 180° from each other.

MAVEN任务观察到，火星的电子通量在尾电流层交叉区增强，但其原因尚不明确。研究利用MAVEN任务观测数据，发现通过比较电子分布函数得出的场向电位与当地总离子密度的对数值大致呈线性相关。这符合双极静电位的预期行为。这种机制不仅出现在电流片交叉处，还可以出现在任何具有大离子密度梯度和高电子温度的地方。这一发现对于了解火星的电子加速机制具有重要意义。 <div>
It has been long observed at Mars that electron fluxes are enhanced during the tail current sheet crossings, of which the cause is not well understood. We use a novel approach to reveal one of the electron energization mechanisms with observations from the Mars Atmospheric and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission. We find the field-aligned potential, derived from comparing electron distribution functions, to be approximately linearly correlated with the logarithmic values of the local total ion density. This is the expected behavior of an ambipolar electrostatic potential. The large amplitude of potential (tens to hundreds of V) is a result of both a significant density gradient (1 order of magnitude) and the high electron temperature (tens of eV) in the tail. Such a mechanism is not limited to ion density enhancements at current sheet crossings but can be present anywhere that large ion density gradients and hot electrons are present.

Recent JWST observations with superb angular resolution have revealed the existence of clumpy galaxies at high redshift through the detection of rest-frame optical emission lines. We use the FirstLight simulation to study the properties of (sub)galactic clumps that are bright in the [O III] λ5007 line with flux greater than ∼10−18 erg s−1 cm−2, to be detected by JWST. For 62 simulated galaxies that have stellar masses of (0.5–6) × 1010M⊙ at z = 5, we find clumps in 1828 snapshots in the redshift range z = 9.5–5.5. The clumps are identified by the surface density of the star formation rate (SFR). About one-tenth of the snapshots show the existence of clumpy systems with two or more components. Most of the clumps are formed by mergers and can be characterized by their ages: central clumps dominated by stellar populations older than 50 Myr, and off-centered clumps dominated by younger stellar populations with specific SFRs of ∼50 Gyr−1. The latter type of young clumps is formed from gas debris in the tidal tails of major mergers with baryonic mass ratios of 1 ≤ q < 4. The merger-induced clumps are short-lived and merge within a dynamical time of several tens of million years. The number density of the clumpy systems is estimated to be ∼10−5 cMpc−3, which is large enough to be detected in recent JWST surveys.

这项研究利用来自太阳动力学观测卫星的多波长数据，通过分析日珥黑子的跃动型慢磁声波来估算其低日冕和色球通道的形成高度，以及确定这些通道在安静条件下的形成高度。通过交叉相关技术，测量了不同通道之间的最频繁时间差，结合局部声速信息，估算出各通道的形成高度。结果显示，在样本中，UV通道的形成高度相对稳定（在250到500公里之间），而日冕通道的形成高度则变化较大。这项研究对理解太阳和其大气物理过程提供了重要的数据。 <br /> <div>
The multiwavelength data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory is extensively used in studying the physics of the Sun and its atmosphere. In this study, we estimate the formation heights of low-corona and chromospheric channels of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) over the atmospheres of sunspot umbrae during the quiet condition period within 20 different active regions. The upward propagating slow magnetoacoustic waves of a 3 minute period, which are perpetually present in sunspots, are utilized for this purpose. Employing a cross-correlation technique, the most frequent time lag between different channel pairs is measured. By combining this information with the local sound speed obtained from the characteristic formation temperatures of individual channels, we estimate the respective formation heights. The median values of formation heights obtained across all active regions in our sample are 356, 368, 858, 1180, and 1470 km, respectively, for the AIA 1600, 1700, 304, 131, and 171 Å channels. The corresponding ranges in the formation heights are 247–453, 260–468, 575–1155, 709–1937, and 909–2585 km, respectively. These values are measured with respect to the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager continuum. We find the formation height of UV channels is quite stable (between 250 and 500 km) and displays only a marginal difference between the AIA 1600 and 1700 Å channels during quiet conditions. On the other hand, the formation height of coronal channels is quite variable.

<title>Evidence of Extreme Ionization Conditions and Low Metallicity in GHZ2/GLASS-Z12 from a Combined Analysis of NIRSpec and MIRI Observations</title>

<div> 高红移星系 GHZ2/GLASS-z12；JWST 观测；红移测量；光谱特征；极端电离条件<br />
<br />总结:<br />研究了GHZ2星系的NIRSpec + MIRI谱数据。发现其具有极端的电离条件和高密度，推测可能是由于活跃星系核或是高密度星形成环境所致。此外，星系具有低金属丰度，表明其星际介质在过去几百万年中迅速进行了化学丰度。研究还指出大约10%的电离光子逸出GHZ2并开始重新电离周围的星系介质。最后，研究认为在高红移下，UV-至-光谱线比诊断可能已经接近其极限，因为这种方法可能受到这些极端红移星系独特条件的挑战。 <div>
GHZ2/GLASS-z12, one of the most distant galaxies found in JWST observations, has been recently observed with both the NIRSpec and MIRI spectrographs, establishing a spectroscopic redshift zspec = 12.34 and making it the first system at z > 10 with complete spectroscopic coverage from rest-frame UV to optical wavelengths. This galaxy is identified as a strong C ivλ1549 emitter (EW = 46 Å) with many other detected emission lines, such as N iv]λ1488, He iiλ1640, O iii]λλ1661,1666, N iii]λ1750, C iii]λλ1907,1909, [O ii]λλ3726,3729, [Ne iii]λ3869, [O iii]λλ4959,5007, and Hα, including a remarkable detection of the O iii Bowen fluorescence line at rest frame λ = 3133 Å. We analyze in this paper the joint NIRSpec + MIRI spectral data set. Combining six optical strong-line diagnostics (namely R2, R3, R23, O32, Ne3O2, and Ne3O2Hd), we find extreme-ionization conditions, with log10 ([O III]λλ4959,5007/[O II]λλ3726,3729) = 1.39 ± 0.19 and log10 ([Ne III]λ3869/[O II]λλ3726,3729) = 0.37 ± 0.18 in stark excess compared to typical values in the interstellar medium (ISM) at lower redshifts. These line properties are compatible either with an active galactic nucleus (AGN) or with a compact, very dense star-forming environment (ΣSFR ≃ 102–103M⊙ yr−1 kpc−2 and ≃ 104–105M⊙ pc−2), with a high ionization parameter (log10(U) =−1.75 ± 0.16), a high ionizing photon production efficiency , and a low gas-phase metallicity (also confirmed by the direct, Te method) ranging between 4% and 11% Z⊙, indicating a rapid chemical enrichment of the ISM in the past few megayears. These properties also suggest that a substantial amount of ionizing photons (∼10%) are leaking outside of GHZ2 and starting to reionize the surrounding intergalactic medium, possibly due to strong radiation-driven winds. The general lessons learned from GHZ2 are the following: (i) the UV-to-optical combined nebular indicators are broadly in agreement with UV-only or optical-only indicators; (ii) UV+optical diagnostics fail to discriminate between an AGN and star formation in a low-metallicity, high-density, and extreme-ionization environment; and (iii) comparing the nebular line ratios with local analogs may be approaching its limits at z ≳ 10, as this approach is potentially challenged by the unique conditions of star formation experienced by galaxies at these extreme redshifts.

We present the CO(1–0) maps of 28 infrared-bright galaxies from the Great Observatories All-Sky Luminous Infrared Galaxy Survey (GOALS) taken with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA). We detect 100 GHz continuum in 16 of the 28 CARMA GOALS galaxies, which trace both active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and compact star-forming cores. The GOALS galaxies show a variety of molecular gas morphologies, though in the majority of cases the average velocity fields show a gradient consistent with rotation. We fit the full continuum spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of each of the sources using either magphys or SED3FIT (if there are signs of an AGN) to derive the total stellar mass, dust mass, and SFRs of each object. We adopt a value determined from luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs) of αCO = M⊙ (K km s−1 pc2)−1, which leads to more physical values for fmol and the gas-to-dust ratio. Mergers tend to have the highest gas-to-dust ratios. We assume the cospatiality of the molecular gas and star formation and plot the CARMA GOALS sample on the Schmidt–Kennicutt relation, where we find that they preferentially lie above the line set by normal star-forming galaxies. This hyper-efficiency is likely due to the increased turbulence in these systems, which decreases the freefall time compared to star-forming galaxies, leading to “enhanced” star formation efficiency. Line wings are present in a non-negligible subsample (11/28) of the CARMA GOALS sources and are likely due to outflows driven by AGNs or star formation, gas inflows, or additional decoupled gas components.

Low-surface-brightness galaxies (LSBGs) are excellent probes of quenching and other environmental processes near massive galaxies. We study an extensive sample of LSBGs near massive hosts in the local universe that are distributed across a diverse range of environments. The LSBGs with surface-brightness are drawn from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 catalog while the hosts with masses comparable to the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud are selected from the z0MGS sample. We study the projected radial density profiles of LSBGs as a function of their color and surface brightness around hosts in both the rich Fornax–Eridanus cluster environment and the low-density field. We detect an overdensity with respect to the background density, out to 2.5 times the virial radius for both hosts in the cluster environment and the isolated field galaxies. When the LSBG sample is split by g − i color or surface brightness μeff, g, we find the LSBGs closer to their hosts are significantly redder and brighter, like their high-surface-brightness counterparts. The LSBGs form a clear “red sequence” in both the cluster and isolated environments that is visible beyond the virial radius of the hosts. This suggests preprocessing of infalling LSBGs and a quenched backsplash population around both host samples. More so, the relative prominence of the “blue cloud” feature implies that preprocessing is ongoing near the isolated hosts compared to the cluster environment where the LSBGs are already well processed.

Stellar bars in disk galaxies grow as stars in near-circular orbits lose angular momentum to their environments, including their dark matter (DM) halo, and transform into elongated bar orbits. This angular momentum exchange during galaxy evolution hints at a connection between bar properties and the DM halo spin λ, the dimensionless form of DM angular momentum. We investigate the connection between halo spin λ and galaxy properties in the presence/absence of stellar bars, using the cosmological magnetohydrodynamic TNG50 simulations at multiple redshifts (0 < zr < 1). We determine the bar strength (or bar amplitude, A2/A0), using Fourier decomposition of the face-on stellar density distribution. We determine the halo spin for barred and unbarred galaxies (0 < A2/A0 < 0.7) in the center of the DM halo, close to the galaxy’s stellar disk. At zr = 0, there is an anticorrelation between halo spin and bar strength. Strongly barred galaxies (A2/A0 > 0.4) reside in DM halos with low spin and low specific angular momentum at their centers. In contrast, unbarred/weakly barred galaxies (A2/A0 < 0.2) exist in halos with higher central spin and higher specific angular momentum. The anticorrelation is due to the barred galaxies’ higher DM mass and lower angular momentum than the unbarred galaxies at zr = 0, as a result of galaxy evolution. At high redshifts (zr = 1), all galaxies have higher halo spin compared to those at lower redshifts (zr = 0), with a weak anticorrelation for galaxies having A2/A0 > 0.2. The formation of DM bars in strongly barred systems highlights how angular momentum transfer to the halo can influence its central spin.

Most of the dynamical mass loss from star clusters is thought to be caused by the time variability of the tidal field (“tidal shocks”). Systematic studies of tidal shocks have been hampered by the fact that each tidal history is unique, implying both a reproducibility and a generalization problem. Here we address these issues by investigating how star cluster evolution depends on the statistical properties of its tidal history. We run a large suite of direct N-body simulations of clusters with tidal histories generated from power spectra of a given slope and with different normalizations, which determine the timescales and amplitudes of the shocks, respectively. At fixed normalization (i.e., the same median tidal field strength), the dissolution timescale is nearly independent of the power spectrum slope. However, the dispersion in dissolution timescales, obtained by repeating simulations for different realizations of statistically identical tidal histories, increases with the power spectrum slope. This result means that clusters experiencing high-frequency shocks have more similar mass-loss histories than clusters experiencing low-frequency shocks. The density–mass relationship of the simulated clusters follows a power law with slope between 1.08 and 1.45, except for the lowest normalizations (for which clusters effectively evolve in a static tidal field). Our findings suggest that star cluster evolution can be described statistically from a time-series analysis of its tidal history, which is an important simplification for describing the evolution of the star cluster population during galaxy formation and evolution.

The McVittie–Plummer spacetime is a spherically symmetric inhomogeneous cosmological model that represents a spherical star system embedded in a standard Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) cosmological model. We study the main physical properties of this gravitational field. Regarding the interplay between the physics of the local system and the expanding background, we employ the Misner–Sharp mass–energy function to show that there is a relatively weak time-dependent general relativistic coupling between the astrophysical system and the background FLRW cosmological model. The coupling term is proportional to the inverse of the scale factor and decreases as the Universe expands.

总结:
本研究对RM160（SDSS J141041.25+531849.0）进行了速度分辨的映射分析，监测了10年的数据。在分析过程中将观测基线分为低态和高态两个阶段，并观察到不同动力学特征的气体在不同状态下主导线发射。在低态时，Hβ VRLP显示出向宽线区域的流入特征，而在高态时趋于平坦。Hα VRLP在低态时表现出与被辐射的宽线区域质量成平方反比的特征，而在高态时显示出流入特征。研究发现宽线区域的半径和速度没有遵循恒定的维里量子。此外，宽线区域的滞后时间与连续光度存在相关性，这符合宽线区域气体对照射连续光的迅速响应。然而，宽线区域的运动特性以不可预测的方式变化，这与连续光度变化和回波滞后时间无关。研究结果表明，在像RM160这样的明亮和高度变化的类星体中，非维里动力学特性可能会显著影响观测到的线型，从而对黑洞质量的估算提出警告。 <div>
We present a velocity-resolved reverberation mapping analysis of the hypervariable quasar RM160 (SDSS J141041.25+531849.0) at z = 0.359 with 153 spectroscopic epochs of data representing a 10 yr baseline (2013–2023). We split the baseline into two regimes based on the 3× flux increase in the light curve: a “low state” phase during the years 2013–2019 and a “high state” phase during the years 2022–2023. The velocity-resolved lag profiles (VRLPs) indicate that gas with different kinematics dominates the line emission in different states. The Hβ VRLP begins with a signature of inflow onto the broad-line region (BLR) in the low state, while in the high state it is flatter with less signature of inflow. The Hα VRLP begins consistent with a virialized BLR in the low state, while in the high state shows a signature of inflow. The differences in the kinematics between the Balmer lines and between the low state and the high state suggests complex BLR dynamics. We find that the BLR radius and velocity (both FWHM and σ) do not obey a constant virial product throughout the monitoring period. We find that the BLR lags and continuum luminosity are correlated, consistent with rapid response of the BLR gas to the illuminating continuum. The BLR kinematic profile changes in unpredictable ways that are not related to continuum changes and reverberation lag. Our observations indicate that nonvirial kinematics can significantly contribute to observed line profiles, suggesting caution for black hole mass estimation in luminous and highly varying quasars like RM160.

At low observation inclination angles, the secondary image of particles is embedded within the primary image. However, as the inclination increases, the primary and secondary images separate, forming a hat-like structure. The spin and charge of the BH, along with the observer’s inclination angle, affect the image’s asymmetry and the distortion of the inner shadow. To investigate the redshift distribution on the accretion disk, we extended the inner boundary of the accretion disk to the event horizon. The results show that the redshift distribution is significantly influenced by the observation inclination angle. Furthermore, we conducted a detailed analysis of the KN BH image using fisheye camera ray-tracing techniques and found that the optical appearance and intensity distribution of the BH vary at different observation frequencies (specifically at 230 GHz and 86 GHz). We also examined differences in intensity distribution for prograde and retrograde accretion disk scenarios. Comparing observational at the two frequencies, we found that both the total intensity and peak intensity at 86 GHz are higher than those at 230 GHz.

We present JWST broadband images of the highly inclined protoplanetary disk SSTc2d J163131.2-242627 (Oph163131) from 2.0 to 21 μm. The images show a remarkable evolution in disk structure with wavelength, quite different from previous JWST observations of other edge-on disks. At 2.0 and 4.4 μm, Oph163131 shows two scattering surfaces separated by a dark lane, typical of highly inclined disks. Starting at 7.7 μm, however, (1) the two linear nebulosities flanking the dark lane disappear; (2) the brighter nebula tracing the disk upper surface transitions into a compact central source distinctly larger than the JWST point-spread function and whose intrinsic size increases with wavelength; and (3) patches of extended emission appear at low latitudes, and at surprisingly large radii nearly twice that of the scattered light seen with Hubble Space Telescope and NIRCam, and of the gas. We interpret the compact central source as thermal emission from the star and the inner disk that is not seen directly, but which instead is able to progressively propagate to greater distances at longer wavelengths. The lack of sharp-edged structures in the extended patchy emission argues against the presence of shocks and suggests photoexcitation or stochastic heating of material smoothly flowing away from the star along the disk surface. Finally, the dark lane thickness decreases significantly between 0.6 and 4.4 μm, which indicates that the surface layers of Oph163131 lack grains larger than 1 μm.

We investigate the radial dependence of the scaling relations of dust attenuation in nearby galaxies using integral field spectroscopy data from MaNGA. We identify ionized gas regions of kiloparsec size from MaNGA galaxies, and for each region we estimate both the stellar attenuation E(B − V)star and gas attenuation E(B − V)gas. We then quantify the correlations of 15 regional/global properties with E(B − V)gas and E(B − V)star, using both the feature importance obtained with the Random Forest regression technique and the Spearman correlation coefficients. The importance of stellar mass, metallicity, and nebular velocity dispersion found previously from studies based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey can be reproduced if our analysis is limited to the central region of galaxies. The scaling relations of both E(B − V)gas and E(B − V)star are found to vary strongly as one goes from the galactic center to outer regions, and from Hα-bright regions to Hα-faint regions. For E(B − V)gas, [N ii]/[S ii] is top-ranked with a much higher correlation coefficient than any other property at 0 < R ≲ Re, while [O iii]/[O ii] outperforms [N ii]/[S ii] as the leading property in the outermost region. For E(B − V)star, stellar age shows the strongest correlation with no/weak dependence on radial distance, although ΣHα and specific star formation rate present similarly strong correlations with E(B − V)star in the galactic center. We find Hα-bright regions to generally show stronger correlations with E(B − V)gas, while Hα-faint regions are more strongly correlated with E(B − V)star, although this depends on individual properties and radial distance. The implications of our results for studies of high-z galaxies are discussed.

总结:
该研究旨在通过对高分辨率、高信噪比的类星体光谱进行线锁特征研究，探讨类星体外流动力学、辐射压在宇宙流动中的作用，以及早期宇宙的恒星形成历史和金属丰度。研究中使用了欧洲南方天文台的UV可见光Echelle分光仪获得了QSO J221531-174408的光谱，并通过C iv、N v 和 Si iv 双线识别相关吸收体，并测量其速度变化、覆盖率和柱密度。随后比较了不同吸收体之间的速度分离，发现了九对锁定的C iv双线、三对锁定的N v双线以及一对锁定的Si iv双线。研究还发现了三个复杂的线锁系统，其中三到五个吸收体通过多离子双线相互锁定。研究表明，线锁是类星体外流中的常见现象，未来需要建立涉及两个云和一个离子双线以上的更复杂的理论模型来解释这些复杂的线锁特征的形成。 <div>
Investigating line-locked phenomena within quasars is crucial for understanding the dynamics of quasar outflows, the role of radiation pressure in astrophysical flows, and the star formation history and metallicity of the early Universe. We have initiated the Tracking Outflow by Line Locking project to study quasar outflow by studying line-locking signatures using high-resolution high-signal-to-noise-ratio quasar spectra. In this paper, we present a case study of the line-locking signatures from QSO J221531-174408. The spectrum was obtained using the Very Large Telescope’s UV Visual Echelle Spectrograph. We first identify associated absorbers in the spectrum using C iv, N v, and Si iv doublets and measure their velocity shifts, covering fractions, and column densities through a line-profile-fitting technique. Then we compare the velocity separations between different absorbers, and detect nine pairs of line-locked C iv doublets, three pairs of line-locked N v doublets, and one pair of line-locked Si iv doublets. This is one of the four quasars known to possess line-locked signatures in C iv, Si iv, and N v at the same time. We also find three complex line-locked systems, where three to five absorbers are locked together through multi-ion doublets. Our study suggests that line locking is a common phenomenon in the quasar outflows, and theoretical models involving more than two clouds and one ionic doublet are needed in the future to explain the formation of these complex line-locking signatures.

<div> Alfvén waves, parametric decay instability, wave packets, boundary conditions, low-β plasma
<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了Alfvén波的参数衰变不稳定性，重点关注了有限大小的波包以及不同边界条件对生长速率的影响。研究表明，在低β等离子体中，圆形和弧极化波列在开放边界条件下比周期性边界条件稳定3-5倍。此外，当波包宽度ℓ小于系统尺寸L时，生长速率几乎呈现出γ ∝ ℓ/L的幂律下降。研究结果表明，泵波的稳定性与实验室设置密切相关，同时子波的生长速率取决于泵波的上下游条件以及其填充的体积分数。本研究可以解释局部Alfvén波的模拟和实验，同时也表明太阳风中的Alfvén波，包括称为开关返的尖锐脉冲，根据风条件可能比传统理论所暗示的更稳定。 <div>
The parametric decay instability of Alfvén waves has been widely studied, but few investigations have examined wave packets of finite size and the effect of different boundary conditions on the growth rate. In this paper, we perform a linear analysis of circular and arc-polarized wave trains and wave packets in periodic and open boundary systems in a low-β plasma. We find that both types of wave are 3–5 times more stable in open boundary conditions compared to periodic. Additionally, once the wave packet width ℓ becomes smaller than the system size L, the growth rate decreases nearly with a power law γ ∝ ℓ/L. This study demonstrates that the stability of a pump wave cannot be separated from the laboratory settings, and that the growth rate of daughter waves depends on the conditions downstream and upstream of the pump wave and on the fraction of volume it fills. Our results can explain simulations and experiments of localized Alfvén waves. They also suggest that Alfvénic fluctuations in the solar wind, including sharp impulses known as switchbacks, can be more stable than traditional theory suggests depending on wind conditions.

V694 Peg是一个A型/浅接触双星系统，并经历了2013年至2019年的A型到W型转变。这种转变可能是由于组件上的大型冷斑点引起的，表明W型现象可能是由于成分的磁活动所引起的。通过收集了17年的505次光最小值时间，并且发现了长期的周期增加和11.81年的周期变化。这种周期变化可能是磁活动循环或第三体存在的结果。与其他A型和W型转变系统相比，V694 Peg被记录为最短周期的。这些转换系统都是晚期型（大于F7）接触双星，并显示出周期性的周期变化，这表明磁活动可能是导致两种接触双星类型转变的原因。发现更多转变接触双星对于研究A型和W型现象的本质至关重要。 <br /><br />总结: V694 Peg是一个A型到W型的双星系统，通过观察其光变曲线发现了一些有趣的特征，包括冷斑点和周期变化。这些特征可能与磁活动有关，为了更深入地了解这一现象，需要继续研究更多的类似系统。 <div>
Three sets of complete multicolor light curves of V694 Peg observed in 2013, 2015, and 2019 were presented and analyzed. Our photometric solutions show that this system was an A-type shallow contact binary in 2013 and 2015 while it converted to a W-type one in 2019. A large cool spot on the component of this binary could explain the conversion, implying the W-type phenomena may be caused by the magnetic activity of the components. We have collected available data on this binary and calculated 505 times of light minimum, which spans 17 yr. The orbital period investigation based on these timings shows there is a long-term period increase at a rate of dP/dt = 4.3(±0.3)×10−9 day yr−1 superposed on a periodic variation with a period of 11.81(±0.06) yr. The cyclic orbital variation may be the result of magnetic activity cycles or the existence of a third body. Until now, only eight transformed systems, including V694 Peg, have been reported. Compared with other converting contact systems between A-type and W-type, V694 Peg is recorded as the shortest-period one. All of these converting systems are late-type (later than F7) contact binaries with the O’Connell effect and show cyclic period variation, which indicates that magnetic activity may be the reason for the conversion between the two types of contact binaries. For investigating the nature of A-type and W-type phenomena, the discovery of more converting contact binaries is essential.

这项研究对质量缩口黑洞(IC 750)进行了详细的X射线光谱分析，发现了大量的相当于中性6.4keV的Fe Kα的等效宽度，这种等效宽度很少由除了密集遮挡物的荧光之外的其他过程产生。通过三种物理模型来拟合X射线光谱，得出了可能的内在2-10 keV光度区间，这些区间涵盖了模型选择的系统性不确定性。尽管预测的内在2-10keV光度在约10^41和10^43 erg s-1之间，但三种模型都认为IC 750具有Compton-thick的观测列密度，置信度超过99%。Compton-thick的遮蔽已被广泛文献证明对于超大质量黑洞AGN的追踪产生了重大偏差。因此，我们的结果首次表明，应该正确考虑Compton-thick的遮蔽，以无偏见地揭示和理解中等质量黑洞(IMBH)的群体。 <br /><br />总结: 关于质量缩口黑洞(IC 750)的X射线光谱分析结果显示，其具有Compton-thick的遮蔽，这表明Compton-thick的遮蔽对于发现和理解中等质量黑洞(IMBH)的群体同样具有重要意义。 <div>
Recent models suggest approximately half of all accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs; MBH ≳ 105M⊙) are expected to undergo intense growth phases behind Compton-thick (NH > 1.5 × 1024 cm−2) veils of obscuring gas. However, despite being a viable source for the seeding of SMBHs, there are currently no examples known of a Compton-thick accreting intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH; MBH ∼ 102–105M⊙). We present a detailed X-ray spectral analysis of IC 750—the only active galactic nuclei (AGN) to date with a precise megamaser-based intermediate mass <105M⊙. We find the equivalent width of neutral 6.4 keV Fe Kα to be keV via phenomenological modeling of the coadded 177 ks Chandra spectrum. Such large equivalent widths are seldom produced by processes other than fluorescence from dense obscuration. We fit three physically motivated X-ray spectral models to infer a range of possible intrinsic 2–10 keV luminosity posteriors that encompass the systematic uncertainties associated with a choice of model. Despite a wide range of predicted intrinsic 2–10 keV luminosities between ∼ 1041 and 1043 erg s−1, all three models agree that IC 750 has a Compton-thick line-of-sight column density to >99% confidence. Compton-thick obscuration is well-documented to impinge substantial bias on the pursuit of SMBH AGN. Our results thus provide the first indication that Compton-thick obscuration should also be properly considered to uncover and understand the IMBH population in an unbiased manner.

在这篇论文中，研究了用SMUGGLE恒星反馈模型进行的星系模拟。对Mvir ∼ 1010M⊙矮星系进行了理想化模拟，并发现通过改变超新星释放给周围气体的动量的方向分布，可以放大或完全抑制星形成的爆发性，且最终形成的恒星总质量可以相差近3倍。具体来说，当动量主要是垂直于气体盘时，星形成不太爆发，并且整体星形成率较低，导致较少的气体湍流，更多盘状形态，并保留尖锐暗物质密度轮廓。这表明需要改进对恒星反馈与非均匀气态介质之间的非线性耦合的理解，以使矮星系的恒星形态和暗物质核心形成的预测更加稳健，且不依赖于有关重子处理的不确定数值选择。

<br /><br />总结：
1. 研究了用SMUGGLE模型进行的星系模拟
2. 发现动量方向会影响星形成的爆发性和总质量
3. 当动量垂直于气体盘时，星形成较缓和且整体星形成率较低

5. 对矮星系的恒星形态和暗物质核心形成的预测需要更加稳健，不依赖于数值选择。 <div>
Simulations of galaxy formation are mostly unable to resolve the energy-conserving phase of individual supernova events, having to resort to subgrid models to distribute the energy and momentum resulting from stellar feedback. However, the properties of these simulated galaxies, including the morphology, stellar mass formed, and the burstiness of the star formation history, are highly sensitive to the numerical choices adopted in these subgrid models. Using the SMUGGLE stellar feedback model, we carry out idealized simulations of an Mvir ∼ 1010M⊙ dwarf galaxy, a regime where most simulation codes predict significant burstiness in star formation, resulting in strong gas flows that lead to the formation of dark matter cores. We find that by varying only the directional distribution of momentum imparted from supernovae to the surrounding gas, while holding the total momentum per supernova constant, bursty star formation may be amplified or completely suppressed, and the total stellar mass formed can vary by as much as a factor of ∼3. In particular, when momentum is primarily directed perpendicular to the gas disk, less bursty and lower overall star formation rates result, yielding less gas turbulence, more disky morphologies, and a retention of cuspy dark matter density profiles. An improved understanding of the nonlinear coupling of stellar feedback into inhomogeneous gaseous media is thus needed to make robust predictions for stellar morphologies and dark matter core formation in dwarfs independent of uncertain numerical choices in the baryonic treatment.

Constraining planet-formation models based on the observed exoplanet population requires generating large samples of synthetic planetary systems, which can be computationally prohibitive. A significant bottleneck is simulating the giant-impact phase, during which planetary embryos evolve gravitationally and combine to form planets, which may themselves experience later collisions. To accelerate giant-impact simulations, we present a machine learning (ML) approach to predicting collisional outcomes in multiplanet systems. Trained on more than 500,000 N-body simulations of three-planet systems, we develop an ML model that can accurately predict which two planets will experience a collision, along with the state of the postcollision planets, from a short integration of the system’s initial conditions. Our model greatly improves on non-ML baselines that rely on metrics from dynamics theory, which struggle to accurately predict which pair of planets will experience a collision. By combining with a model for predicting long-term stability, we create an ML-based giant-impact emulator, which can predict the outcomes of giant-impact simulations with reasonable accuracy and a speedup of up to 4 orders of magnitude. We expect our model to enable analyses that would not otherwise be computationally feasible. As such, we release our training code, along with an easy-to-use user interface for our collision-outcome model and giant-impact emulator (https://github.com/dtamayo/spock).

Modeling the transport of low-energy (1−10 MeV) cosmic-ray electrons can lead to valuable insights as to the behavior of the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF), due to the fact that the mean free path (MFP) of these particles parallel to the HMF is significantly larger than their perpendicular MFP, and that these particles experience little in the way of drift due to gradients/curvatures in the HMF and along the heliospheric current sheet. Jovian electrons are particularly suitable for such an endeavour, as they originate from a decentral source in the inner heliosphere. To this end, the transport of these electrons is studied using a 3D, ab initio particle transport code that incorporates theoretical expressions for electron diffusion coefficients, and utilizes as inputs for these transport coefficients turbulence quantities calculated using a two-component turbulence transport model. The effects of a novel Fisk-type field on the transport of these Jovian electrons are investigated and compared with the effects of a standard Parker field.

总结：<br />
本文研究了快速射电暴（FRBs）可能起源于磁星磁层的情况，通过模拟发现，当FRB的传播方向与背景磁场夹角很小时，其散射效应会大大减弱。经过对辐射角度和发射半径的研究，得出FRB在磁星磁层发生的可能性较大。FRB的小辐射角和大发射半径对于其在磁层内的传播有益。文章结果支持了FRB可能源自磁星磁层的假设。 <div>
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration transients observed in the radio band, with their origin and radiation mechanism remaining unclear to date. Growing evidence indicates that at least some FRBs originate from magnetars and are likely generated within the magnetospheres of these highly magnetized neutron stars. However, a recent study suggested that FRBs originating from magnetar magnetospheres would be scattered by magnetospheric electron–positron pair plasma, making it impossible for them to escape successfully. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the scattering effect can be greatly attenuated if the angle between the FRB propagation direction and the background magnetic field is ∼10−2 rad or smaller. When the angle is around 10−1 rad, the beaming effect of FRBs becomes significant in reducing scattering. Such FRBs have small transverse spatial sizes, which can help them instantly push the front plasma laterally out of the radiation region. This significantly mitigates the FRB-induced two-photon annihilation reaction, γ + γ → e− + e+, which was previously regarded as a key factor hindering the propagation of FRBs. A critical radiation-cone half-opening angle between 10−3 and 10−2 rad is found for an FRB with isotropic luminosity Liso ∼ 1042 erg s−1 and emitted at a radius rem ≲ 109 cm in the magnetosphere of a magnetar. Smaller beaming angles and larger emission radii can be more advantageous for the propagation of FRBs in magnetospheres. Our result supports the scenario that FRBs could originate from magnetar magnetospheres.

A stellar-mass black hole (BH) surrounded by a neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF) is generally considered to be the central engine of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Neutrinos escaping from the disk will annihilate outside the disk to produce the fireball that could power GRBs with blackbody (BB) components. The initial GRB jet power and fireball launch radius are related to the annihilation luminosity and annihilation height of the NDAFs, respectively. In this paper, we collect seven GRBs with known redshifts and identified BB components to test whether the NDAF model works. We find that, in most cases, the values of the accretion rates and the central BH properties are all in the reasonable range, suggesting that these BB components indeed originate from the neutrino annihilation process.

总结: <br />这篇论文利用成像X射线偏振探测器的观测数据，研究了蟹状星云外环和天蝎座-Vela星云的偏振磁场。蟹状星云外环的极化角度表现出随方位角单调变化的特征，与椭圆环的法线一致。同时，蟹状星云外环的极化矢量与结构一致，暗示着一个0.8倍光速的物质流动。相比之下，天蝎座-Vela星云的极化磁场不完全与结构一致，表现出一个不完全的环状磁场结构。此外，蟹状星云具有一个极化的环形磁场，而天蝎座-Vela星云则呈现出一个不完整的环形磁场结构。 <div>
Polarization measurements provide insight into the magnetic field, a critical aspect of the dynamics and emission properties around the compact object. In this paper, we present the polarized magnetic field of the Crab outer torus and the Vela arc utilizing Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer observation data. The polarization angle (PA) measured for the Crab outer torus exhibits two monotonic evolutions along the azimuth angle, which are consistent with the normal line of the elliptical ring. There is a slight increase in PA along the azimuth angle for both the inner arc and the outer arc of the Vela Nebula. The polarized magnetic vector along the outer torus of the Crab Nebula shows the polarized magnetic field aligns with the Crab outer torus structure. The PA variation along the Crab outer torus suggests a bulk flow speed of 0.8c. Meanwhile, the Vela Nebula polarized magnetic field does not exactly align with the Vela arc structure. We noted that the Crab Nebula possesses a polarized toroidal magnetic field, whereas the Vela Nebula exhibits an incomplete toroidal magnetic field.

这项研究分析了2014年至2019年间Spitzer Space Telescope观测到的约950个微引力透镜事件样本，重点关注了9个微引力透镜事件子样本，根据它们的长时间尺度、小微引力透镜视差和Gaia任务的联合观测进行了选择，以增加所选透镜为巨大并且质量可测量的概率。在所选事件中，识别了黑洞和中子星候选透镜，并有望通过2026年Gaia时序测量数据的发布进行进一步确认。利用贝叶斯分析和银河模型，以及Gaia数据发布3的恰当运动数据，确定了四个潜在的暗残余体候选者：OGLE-2016-BLG-0293，OGLE-2018-BLG-0483，OGLE-2018-BLG-0662和 OGLE-2015-BLG-0149，其透镜质量分别为，，和。值得注意的是，前两个候选者有望展现Gaia可探测到的天文微引力透镜信号，从而提供验证透镜质量的可能性。本研究中开发的方法将应用于整个Spitzer微引力透镜样本，填补和分析时间尺度（tE）与视差（πE）图，以推导透镜总体和巨大残余体特别是残余体的约束。

In the pursuit of understanding the population of stellar remnants within the Milky Way, we analyze the sample of ∼950 microlensing events observed by the Spitzer Space Telescope between 2014 and 2019. In this study we focus on a subsample of nine microlensing events, selected based on their long timescales, small microlensing parallaxes, and joint observations by the Gaia mission, to increase the probability that the chosen lenses are massive and the mass is measurable. Among the selected events we identify lensing black holes and neutron star candidates, with potential confirmation through forthcoming release of the Gaia time-series astrometry in 2026. Utilizing Bayesian analysis and Galactic models, along with the Gaia Data Release 3 proper-motion data, four good candidates for dark remnants were identified: OGLE-2016-BLG-0293, OGLE-2018-BLG-0483, OGLE-2018-BLG-0662, and OGLE-2015-BLG-0149, with lens masses of , , and , respectively. Notably, the first two candidates are expected to exhibit astrometric microlensing signals detectable by Gaia, offering the prospect of validating the lens masses. The methodologies developed in this work will be applied to the full Spitzer microlensing sample, populating and analyzing the timescale (tE) versus parallax (πE) diagram to derive constraints on the population of lenses in general and massive remnants in particular.

Lyα光谱，星系，JWST，红移，再电离<br /><br />总结:
本研究分析了JWST对z≳6.5星系的Lyα光谱，使用了公共数据库中的观测数据，涵盖了四个独立领域：GOOS-N、GOODS-S、A2744和EGS。我们测量了210个z≃6.5-13星系的Lyα发射线特性，并在所有案例中独立于Lyα确认了红移。我们发现三个新的Lyα发射线的探测，并且在GOOS-N中发现了一个大等效宽度（EW=143 Å）的Lyα发射线（LAE），并且还有强C iv发射（EW=21 Å），红移为7.1。我们测量了样本中Lyα等效宽度随红移的分布。我们发现在更早的时期，强Lyα发射（EW>25 Å）变得越来越罕见，暗示Lyα光子的传输在z≃5和z≃9之间下降了4倍。我们描述了对星系间介质中性分数的潜在影响。LAE比例在不同领域之间存在显著差异。与其他三个领域不同，EGS在z≃7-8没有减少Lyα光子的传输迹象，这表明该领域可能存在明显的电离视线。我们使用了来自第一再电离纪元光谱完整观测调查的NIRCam光栅观测数据，用于描述在GOOS领域周围已知LAE的大尺度密度过剩。在大多数情况下，最强的过剩密度似乎与极强的Lyα检测（EW>50 Å）有关。未来JWST的Lyα光谱观测有潜力约束早期星系密度周围电离区域的大小，提供再电离过程的新探针。 <div>
We present an analysis of JWST Lyα spectroscopy of z ≳ 6.5 galaxies, using observations in the public archive covering galaxies in four independent fields: Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS)-N, GOODS-S, A2744, and the Extended Groth Strip (EGS). We measure the Lyα emission line properties for a sample of 210 z ≃ 6.5–13 galaxies, with redshifts confirmed independently of Lyα in all cases. We present three new detections of Lyα emission in JWST spectra, including a large equivalent width (EW; =143 Å) Lyα emitter (LAE) with strong C iv emission (EW = 21 Å) at z = 7.1 in GOODS-N. We measure the redshift-dependent Lyα EW distribution across our sample. We find that strong Lyα emission (EW > 25 Å) becomes increasingly rare at earlier epochs, suggesting that the transmission of Lyα photons decreases by 4× between z ≃ 5 and z ≃ 9. We describe potential implications for the intergalactic medium neutral fraction. There is significant field-to-field variance in the LAE fraction. In contrast to the three other fields, the EGS shows no evidence for reduced transmission of Lyα photons at z ≃ 7–8, suggesting a significantly ionized sight line may be present in the field. We use available NIRCam grism observations from the First Reionization Epoch Spectroscopically Complete Observations survey to characterize overdensities on large scales around known LAEs in the GOODS fields. The strongest overdensities appear linked with extremely strong Lyα detections (EW > 50 Å) in most cases. Future Lyα spectroscopy with JWST has the potential to constrain the size of ionized regions around early galaxy overdensities, providing a new probe of the reionization process.

<div> 强度映射, 大尺度, 宇宙学调查, 交叉相关, 蒙特卡洛模拟
<br />
强度映射是大规模测量选定光谱线但不分辨个体源的方法，目前正在迅速兴起并成为进行大型宇宙学调查的有效方式。多个调查涵盖各种光谱线（如氢原子的21厘米超精细线，一氧化碳的旋转谱线以及[C ii]精细结构线等），正在进行观测或即将上线，承诺在广泛红移范围内为我们提供宇宙的全光谱视图。交叉相关已成为一个有吸引力的前景，既可以探测潜在的天体物理，又可以减轻观测系统的系统偏差。本文构建了一个端到端的分析强度映射交叉相关的流程，通过蒙特卡洛模拟传播仪器效应、前景残留和分析选择到一组严格的误差属性，包括误差协方差、窗函数和功率谱估计的完整概率分布。我们使用这一框架来批判性地检验简化假设的适用性，比如功率谱误差的独立性和高斯性。作为案例，我们预测了近期和未来的21厘米×[C ii]交叉相关测量的灵敏度，并提出了对调查设计的建议。 
<br /><br />总结: 强度映射是一种快速兴起的大规模宇宙学调查方法，利用交叉相关可以探测天体物理和减轻观测系统误差。文章构建了一个分析强度映射交叉相关的流程，并使用蒙特卡洛模拟来传播误差属性，最后对近期和未来的调查提出了建议。 <div>
Intensity mapping—the large-scale mapping of selected spectral lines without resolving individual sources—is quickly emerging as an efficient way to conduct large cosmological surveys. Multiple surveys covering a variety of lines (such as the hydrogen 21 cm hyperfine line, carbon-monoxide rotational lines, and [C ii] fine-structure lines, among others) are either observing or will soon be online, promising a panchromatic view of our Universe over a broad redshift range. With multiple lines potentially covering the same volume, cross-correlations have become an attractive prospect, both for probing the underlying astrophysics and for mitigating observational systematics. For example, cross-correlating 21 cm and [C ii] intensity maps during reionization could reveal the characteristic scale of ionized bubbles around the first galaxies, while simultaneously providing a convenient way to reduce independent foreground contaminants between the two surveys. However, many of the desirable properties of cross-correlations in principle emerge only under ideal conditions, such as infinite ensemble averages. In this paper, we construct an end-to-end pipeline for analyzing intensity mapping cross-correlations, enabling instrumental effects, foreground residuals, and analysis choices to be propagated through Monte Carlo simulations to a set of rigorous error properties, including error covariances, window functions, and full probability distributions for power-spectrum estimates. We use this framework to critically examine the applicability of simplifying assumptions such as the independence and Gaussianity of power-spectrum errors. As worked examples, we forecast the sensitivity of near-term and futuristic 21 cm × [C ii] cross-correlation measurements, providing recommendations for survey design.

总结: <br />
本文报告了来自NOAA 11261活动区域的M9.3耀斑和线状物活动，它们受3D磁学骨架的强烈调节。通过磁场外推法发现了复杂的磁连接和活动区域东南方存在一个高日冕虚点。小型线状物在倒V型极性反转线上方喷发，导致M9.3耀斑并形成相对较大的线状物。硬X射线辐射轨迹显示磁重联点向上沿着日冕虚点传播。同时，EUV观察显示了日冕质量抛射样式的喷发特征。闭合扇区限制了大型线状物和相应的耀斑。我们展示了磁学骨架和活动之间的时空关系，并得出结论，磁学骨架可以调节并确定所研究活动的几乎所有特征。 <div>
We report an M9.3 flare and filaments activities from NOAA Active Region 11261 that are strongly modulated by the 3D magnetic skeleton. Magnetic field extrapolation from the vector magnetic field suggests complex magnetic connectivity and the existence of a high coronal null point southeast of the active region. A small filament over the inversed V-shaped polarity inversion line erupted and resulted in the M9.3 flare associated with a weak ejection in the EUV hot channel and the formation of a relatively large filament. Both the weak ejection and the eruption of the large filament were toward the southeast. Comparative analyses have disclosed the following new facts. First, the trajectory of looptop hard X-ray emission provides solid evidence that the magnetic reconnection site propagated up toward the coronal null point as the flare and filaments erupted. Second, the EVU observations show coronal mass ejection-like eruption features in the ejection region of the magnetic skeleton. Third, the closed fan confined the west end of the large filament and the corresponding flare ribbons. We demonstrate a spatiotemporal relationship between the magnetic skeleton and the flare filament activity. We conclude that the magnetic skeleton can modulate and determine almost all the characteristics of the studied activity in the corresponding scale.

<div> 磁场，太阳风，静止区域，热性质，太阳辐射<br />
总结:<br />
Parker Solar Probe观测到了具有近径向Parker螺旋几何形状的磁场区域，被称为静止区域。这些区域在太阳风的磁场强度变化（δB/〈∣B∣〉）方面表现出非常低的特点。静止区域具有较低的太阳风速度、质子温度和质子密度。在15个太阳半径内，静止区域显示出明显的热性质差异，具有较高的质子温度各向异性和较低的平行等离子体贝塔值。静止区域的太阳风在-β∥p图上更加稳定，表明其起源与周围更湍流的非静止太阳风不同。因此，增强的温度各向异性和增强的磁场强度可能与磁场线经历的磁场膨胀程度较小有关。 <div>
Regions of magnetic fields with near-radial, Parker-spiral-like geometry known as quiescent regions have been observed in Parker Solar Probe data. These regions have very low δB/〈∣B∣〉 compared to nonquiescent solar wind at the same heliocentric distances. Quiescent regions are observed to have lower solar wind bulk speeds, lower proton temperatures, and lower proton density. Inside of 15 solar radii (R⊙), identified quiescent regions show distinct thermal properties, having higher proton temperature anisotropies and lower parallel plasma betas compared to switchback patches observed at the same heliocentric distances. When placed on -versus-β∥p plots (where is the proton temperature anisotropy), quiescent region solar wind is shown to be more stable to proton cyclotron and firehose instabilities than nonquiescent solar wind at the same heliocentric distances. It is shown that quiescent regions evolve similarly to the surrounding nonquiescent solar wind, but quiescent solar wind begins at a different location in the -versus-β∥p parameter space, suggesting that these regions have separate origins from the more turbulent nonquiescent solar wind. Namely, enhanced temperature anisotropies and enhanced magnetic field strength may be consistent with magnetic field lines that have undergone less magnetic field expansion compared to nonquiescent wind at the same heliocentric distances.

We develop a new method for studying the Galactic magnetic field along the spiral arms using pulsar Faraday rotation measures (RMs). Our new technique accounts for the dot-product nature of Faraday rotation and also splits the associated path integral into segments corresponding to particular zones along the line of sight. We apply this geometrically corrected, arm-by-arm technique to the low-latitude portion of a recently published set of Arecibo Faraday RMs for 313 pulsars, along with previously obtained RMs in the same regions. We find disparities >1σ between the magnitude of the field above and below the plane in the Local Arm, Sagittarius Arm, Sagittarius-to-Scutum Interarm, Scutum Arm, and Perseus Arm. We find evidence for a single field reversal near the Local Arm–Sagittarius Arm boundary. Interestingly, our results suggest that this field reversal is dependent on latitude, occurring inside the Sagittarius Arm at negative Galactic latitudes and at the Local Arm–Sagittarius Arm boundary at positive Galactic latitudes. We discuss all of our results in the context of different models and other observational Galactic magnetic field analyses.

这项研究利用第三次LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA引力波瞬变目录中的43个引力波源和Pantheon+合编的1590个光度曲线，来约束暗能量模型，以实现对宇宙参数的精确测量。利用暗射波引力波事件，估计相应的红移。引力波和超新星联合数据能够提供对ΛCDM模型哈勃常数H0和现在物质密度Ωm约16%和8%的精度，并约束暗能量状态方程w的精度约为24%。尽管联合引力波和超新星观测有效地打破了各种宇宙学参数的简并，得到了更严格的约束，但这些约束的精度仍不符合精密宇宙学所需的严格标准。然而，可以合理预期，在不久的将来，引力波和超新星的联合观测将成为在晚期宇宙尤其是对宇宙参数进行精确测量的强大工具。 <div>
The growing tensions between the early Universe and the late Universe increasingly highlight the importance of developing precise probes for late cosmology. As significant late-Universe probes, Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and gravitational waves (GWs) can provide measurements of relative and absolute distances, respectively. Their complementary nature is likely to break the degeneracies among cosmological parameters, thereby yielding more precise constraints. In this study, we use 43 gravitational-wave sources from the Third LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) and 1590 light curves from Pantheon+ compilation to constrain the dark energy models, as an attempt to achieve precise late-Universe cosmological constraints. For the dark siren GW event, we estimate the corresponding redshift using the binary black hole redshift distribution model. The combination of GW and SNe Ia data could provide the precision on the Hubble constant H0 and the present matter density Ωm of approximately 16% and 8% for the ΛCDM model. If we consider the equation of state of dark energy w, the combination sample constrains the precision of w to approximately 24%. Although the combination of GWs and SNe Ia observations effectively breaks degeneracies among various cosmological parameters, yielding more stringent constraints, the precision of these constraints still does not meet the stringent standards required by precision cosmology. However, it is reasonable to anticipate that, in the near future, the joint observations of GWs and SNe Ia will become a powerful tool, particularly in the late Universe, for the precise measurement of cosmological parameters.

<div> 高红移类星体、Fe ii/Mg ii比率、宇宙时钟、铁的丰度、早期宇宙演化
总结:
研究了高红移类星体的Fe ii/Mg ii比率及其在早期宇宙中作为铁和α元素丰度的代理。使用VLT XSHOOTER采集了一组明亮类星体的高质量近红外光谱。结果显示，在z = 1到6.6的广泛红移范围内，Fe ii/Mg ii比率没有显著的演化。这一结果支持了之前的研究结果，表明在高红移时期，超大质量黑洞周围的铁快速富集。 <div>
The Fe ii/Mg ii emission line flux ratio in quasar spectra serves as a proxy for the relative Fe to α-element abundances in the broad-line regions of quasars. Due to the expected different enrichment timescales of the two elements, they can be used as a cosmic clock in the early Universe. We present a study of the Fe ii/Mg ii ratios in a sample of luminous quasars exploiting high-quality near-IR spectra taken primarily by the XQR-30 program with VLT XSHOOTER. These quasars have a median bolometric luminosity of log(Lbol[erg s−1]) ∼ 47.3 and cover a redshift range of z = 6.0–6.6. The median value of the measured Fe ii/Mg ii ratios is ∼7.9 with a normalized median absolute deviation of ∼2.2. In order to trace the cosmic evolution of Fe ii/Mg ii in an unbiased manner, we select two comparison samples of quasars with similar luminosities and high-quality spectra from the literature, one at intermediate redshifts (z = 3.5–4.8) and the other at low redshifts (z = 1.0–2.0). We perform the same spectral analysis for all these quasars, including the usage of the same iron template, the same spectral fitting method, and the same wavelength fitting windows. We find no significant redshift evolution in the Fe ii/Mg ii ratio over the wide redshift range from z = 1 to 6.6. The result is consistent with previous studies and supports the scenario of a rapid iron enrichment in the vicinity of accreting supermassive black holes at high redshift.

总结: 
镧系元素的准确原子结构和波长依赖的不透明度高度不确定，这导致在建模短暂事件如光新星和估算质量、特征速度和重金属含量等关键性质时出现系统误差。研究量化了来自文献各处的原子数据以及r过程放射性衰变加热的热化效率选择对光新星光谱的影响。研究结果表明，原子数据的差异对估算镧系物质质量分数有显著影响，质量估算通常相差25%至40%。 选择热化效率也可能对质量估计产生20%至50%的影响。观测性质如颜色和衰变速率高度依赖于模型。速度估计在仅基于光变曲线拟合时，典型误差约为100%。轻r过程元素的原子数据可能强烈影响蓝色发射。即使是像GW170817这样观测良好的事件，使用不同的原子数据集估算的总镧系产量可能相差约6倍。 <br /><br /> <div>
The precise atomic structure and therefore the wavelength-dependent opacities of lanthanides are highly uncertain. This uncertainty introduces systematic errors in modeling transients like kilonovae and estimating key properties such as mass, characteristic velocity, and heavy metal content. Here, we quantify how atomic data from across the literature as well as choices of thermalization efficiency of r-process radioactive decay heating impact the light curve and spectra of kilonovae. Specifically, we analyze the spectra of a grid of models produced by the radiative transfer code Sedona that span the expected range of kilonova properties to identify regions with the highest systematic uncertainty. Our findings indicate that differences in atomic data have a substantial impact on estimates of lanthanide mass fraction, spanning approximately 1 order of magnitude for lanthanide-rich ejecta, and demonstrate the difficulty in precisely measuring the lanthanide fraction in lanthanide-poor ejecta. Mass estimates vary typically by 25%–40% for differing atomic data. Similarly, the choice of thermalization efficiency can affect mass estimates by 20%–50%. Observational properties such as color and decay rate are highly model dependent. Velocity estimation, when fitting solely based on the light curve, can have a typical error of ∼100%. Atomic data of light r-process elements can strongly affect blue emission. Even for well-observed events like GW170817, the total lanthanide production estimated using different atomic data sets can vary by a factor of ∼6.

<div> 辐射压力, 硅酸盐, 铁含量, 凝结距离, 颗粒聚集

总结:
辐射传输计算显示，不含铁的硅酸盐可以在恒星附近凝结，但通常缺乏足够的不透明度推动气流，除非颗粒足够大，以至于散射引起的辐射压力显著。含铁硅酸盐具有更高的吸收不透明度，但由于吸收更强，其预期凝结位置远远超出了预期的尘埃形成区。最近的研究表明，SiO的冷凝生长效率较低，这意味着成核可能持续更长时间，产生更多更小的初生颗粒，增加了在这些气流中颗粒聚集的可能性。通过聚集成分形聚集物，我们研究了辐射压力随着这些初生颗粒聚集的变化。使用镁铝橄榄石和天文硅酸盐的光学特性进行不同数量（最高256个）初生颗粒和不同分形维度（1.8和2.8）的组合进行不透明度计算。对于半径小于0.1μm的初生颗粒，聚集导致辐射压力增强，超过了等效孤立初生颗粒的结果。 <div>
There is still considerable debate on the exact composition of grains formed in the outflows of O-rich, asymptotic giant branch stars. Estimates of the expected condensation distances based on radiative transfer calculations show that iron-free silicates can condense close to the star but typically lack the opacity to drive an outflow unless they are large enough that radiation pressure due to scattering on the grains becomes significant. Iron-containing silicates have a much higher absorption opacity, but due to this stronger absorption, their expected condensation location is well beyond the expected dust formation zone. Recent measurements of the efficiency of SiO condensational growth have shown that this rate is low. The result of this low growth efficiency is that nucleation may persist for longer, giving a larger number of smaller primary particles, leading to an increased likelihood of particle aggregation in these outflows. In this work, we examine how the radiation pressure changes with the possible aggregation of these primary particles into fractal aggregates. Opacity calculations are made using optical properties of both forsterite and astronomical silicate for aggregates containing up to 256 primary particles and for fractal dimensions of 1.8 and 2.8. For primary particles of radius less than ∼0.1 μm, aggregation leads to an enhancement of the radiation pressure over an equivalent cloud of isolated primary particles.

<div> 关键词: 太阳黑子群，倾斜角，太阳活动周期，数据分析，太阳表面磁场<br />
总结: <br />
研究利用来自SOHO / MDI和SDO / HMI的磁图测量了2008年至2023年间11,373个太阳黑子群的倾斜角。研究发现，在太阳活动周期24期间，太阳黑子群的倾斜角随着纬度的增加而增加，符合Joy定律。另外，发现了倾斜角与太阳活动强度之间的显著负相关关系。研究还揭示了倾斜角参数的南北半球不对称性，南半球的倾斜角显著大于北半球。 <div>
The tilt angle of sunspot groups plays a crucial role in solar dynamo models for the generation of the poloidal field, yet the statistical properties of the tilt angle are not fully comprehended. This study employs magnetograms from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Michelson Doppler Imager and Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager to measure the tilt angles of 11,373 sunspot groups over the period from 2008 to 2023. This comprehensive analysis examines the relationship between the tilt angle and latitude of the sunspot groups, as well as the correlation between the tilt angle and solar cycle strength. The methodology involves calculating tilt angles within the ±45° central meridian distance, comparing mean-based and median-based measurements, and applying specific angular separation criteria. The findings reveal that during solar cycle 24, the tilt angles increase by approximately 4° for every 10° increase in latitude, in line with Joy’s law. A significant anticorrelation is observed between the latitude-normalized tilt angle (γ/∣L∣) and solar cycle strength. The research also uncovers a substantial hemispheric asymmetry in tilt angle parameters, with the southern hemisphere (mJoy: 0.23 ± 0.092 ∼ 0.24 ± 0.074, γ = 8.°14 ± 0.°43 ∼ 9.°04 ± 0.°486) consistently showing larger tilt angles than the northern hemisphere (mJoy: 0.47 ± 0.096 ∼ 0.51 ± 0.062, γ = 6.°14 ± 0.°304 ∼ 6.°64 ± 0.°334).

<div> 关键词: 磁通量、太阳磁场、数值模拟、磁扭曲、活跃区域
总结:
太阳深对流区的磁通量的出现对太阳磁活动起着重要作用，研究表明磁扭曲对磁通量的出现有一定影响。研究使用了R2D2代码进行了数值模拟，通过系统性地调研了初始磁扭曲。结果表明，无论初始的扭曲如何，磁通量都会被上升并在光球层形成太阳黑子。然而，当扭曲太弱时，光球层的磁通很快就会扩散并不能长期保持成为连贯的太阳黑子。磁扭曲在光球层的度量相对较好，并与太阳观察结果相当。总而言之，超过了扭曲临界值的情况下，发现磁螺旋度相对于总磁通量来说是不合理的大，这意味着扭曲不太可能是太阳耀斑产生活跃区域的一个典型情形。 <div>
The emergence of magnetic flux from the deep convection zone plays an important role in solar magnetism, such as the generation of active regions and triggering of various eruptive phenomena, including jets, flares, and coronal mass ejections. To investigate the effects of magnetic twist on flux emergence, we performed numerical simulations of flux tube emergence using the radiative magnetohydrodynamic code R2D2 and conducted a systematic survey on the initial twist. Specifically, we varied the twist of the initial tube both positively and negatively from zero to twice the critical value for kink instability. As a result, regardless of the initial twist, the flux tube was lifted by the convective upflow and reached the photosphere to create sunspots. However, when the twist was too weak, the photospheric flux was quickly diffused and not retained long as coherent sunspots. The degree of magnetic twist measured in the photosphere conserved the original twist relatively well and was comparable to actual solar observations. Even in the untwisted case, a finite amount of magnetic helicity was injected into the upper atmosphere because the background turbulence added helicity. However, when the initial twist exceeded the critical value for kink instability, the magnetic helicity normalized by the total magnetic flux was found to be unreasonably larger than the observations, indicating that the kink instability of the emerging flux tube may not be a likely scenario for the formation of flare-productive active regions.

We simulate mergers between star clusters embedded within their natal giant molecular cloud. We extract initial conditions from cloud-scale simulations of cluster formation and introduce different prescriptions for primordial binaries. We find that simulations that do not include primordial binaries result in a larger fraction of unbound stars than simulations that include a prescription for binaries based on observations. We also find a preferred direction of motion for stars that become unbound during the merger. Subcluster mergers within realistic gas environments promote binary disruption, while mergers between idealized, gas-rich spherical clusters do not produce the same disruption. Binary systems with smaller semimajor axes are disrupted in simulations of subcluster mergers within their natal environment compared to simulations that do not include the realistic gas environment. We conclude that binary disruption and the production of an anisotropic distribution of unbound stars are the natural consequences of subcluster mergers during star cluster assembly.

<title>A Data-driven Magnetohydrodynamic Simulation of the 2011 February 15 Coronal Mass Ejection from Active Region NOAA 11158</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a boundary data-driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of the 2011 February 15 coronal mass ejection (CME) event of Active Region NOAA 11158. The simulation is driven at the lower boundary with an electric field derived from the normal magnetic field and the vertical electric current measured from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Helioseismic Magnetic Imager vector magnetograms. The simulation shows the buildup of a pre-eruption coronal magnetic field that is close to the nonlinear force-free field extrapolation, and it subsequently develops multiple eruptions. The sheared/twisted field lines of the pre-eruption magnetic field show qualitative agreement with the brightening loops in the SDO Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) hot passband images. We find that the eruption is initiated by the tether-cutting reconnection in a highly sheared field above the central polarity inversion line and a magnetic flux rope with dipped field lines forms during the eruption. The modeled erupting magnetic field evolves to develop a complex structure containing two distinct flux ropes and produces an outgoing double-shell feature consistent with the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory B/Extreme UltraViolet Imager observation of the CME. The foot points of the erupting field lines are found to correspond well with the dimming regions seen in the SDO/AIA observation of the event. These agreements suggest that the derived electric field is a promising way to drive MHD simulations to establish the realistic pre-eruption coronal field based on the observed vertical electric current and model its subsequent dynamic eruption.

<title>The Challenge of Predicting the Solar Wind Speed near Sunspot Minimum</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
By applying potential-field source-surface and potential-field current-sheet extrapolations to photospheric field maps from three different observatories, we predict the solar wind speed at Earth for several Carrington rotations during 2018–2021 and compare the results with in situ observations. The predicted speeds are taken to be inversely correlated with the rate of flux-tube expansion inside the source surface, located at a heliocentric distance of 2.5 R⊙. The results often differ markedly from one observatory to another and are very sensitive to the latitudinal position of the ecliptic relative to the narrow belt of slow wind that surrounds the source-surface neutral line. Our main conclusions are that (1) the magnetograph measurements themselves are a major source of uncertainty in solar wind predictions; (2) these uncertainties are especially large near solar minimum, when Earth is located near the rapid transition between slow and fast wind that occurs on either side of the heliospheric current sheet; (3) comparison of the derived open field regions with observed coronal holes provides a strong, underutilized constraint on wind speed predictions; and (4) the observed polarity of the interplanetary magnetic field provides another important constraint on the location of the source region.

<title>Formation of Jupiter-mass Binary Objects through Photoerosion of Fragmenting Cores</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The recent discovery of tens of Jupiter-mass binary objects (JuMBOs) in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) with the James Webb Space Telescope has intensified the debate on the origin of free-floating planetary mass objects within star-forming regions. The JuMBOs have masses below the opacity limit for fragmentation but have very wide separations (from tens to hundreds of astronomical units), suggesting that they did not form in a similar manner to other substellar mass binaries. Here, we propose that the theory of photoerosion of prestellar cores by Lyman continuum radiation from massive stars could explain the JuMBOs in the ONC. We find that for a range of gas densities the final substellar mass is comfortably within the JuMBO mass range, and the separations of the JuMBOs are consistent with those of more massive (G- and A-type) binaries, which would have formed from the fragmentation of the cores had they not been photoeroded. The photoerosion mechanism is most effective within the H ii region(s) driven by the massive star(s). The majority of the observed JuMBOs lie outside of these regions in the ONC, but they may have formed within them and then subsequently migrated due to dynamical evolution.

We use simulated galaxy observations from the NIHAO-SKIRT-Catalog to test the accuracy of spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling techniques. SED modeling is an essential tool for inferring star formation histories from nearby galaxy observations but is fraught with difficulty due to our incomplete understanding of stellar populations, chemical enrichment processes, and the nonlinear, geometry-dependent effects of dust. The NIHAO-SKIRT-Catalog uses hydrodynamic simulations and radiative transfer to produce SEDs from the ultraviolet (UV) through the infrared (IR), accounting for dust. We use the commonly used Prospector software to perform inference on these SEDs and compare the inferred stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs) to the known values in the simulation. We match the stellar population models to isolate the effects of differences in the star formation history, the chemical evolution history, and the dust. For the high-mass NIHAO galaxies (>109.5M⊙), we find that model mismatches lead to inferred SFRs that are on average underestimated by a factor of 2 when fit to UV through IR photometry, and a factor of 3 when fit to UV through optical photometry. These biases lead to significant inaccuracies in the resulting specific SFR–mass relations, with UV through optical fits showing particularly strong deviations from the true relation of the simulated galaxies. In the context of massive existing and upcoming photometric surveys, these results highlight that star formation history inference from photometry may remain imprecise and inaccurate and that there is a pressing need for more realistic testing of existing techniques.

Recent numerical simulations have shown that the unstable disk within the central regime of the primordial gas cloud fragments to form multiple protostars on several scales. Their evolution depends on the mass accretion phenomenon, interaction with the surrounding medium and radiative feedback respectively. In this work, we use a fast semianalytical framework in order to model multiple protostars within a rotating cloud, where the mass accretion is estimated via a Bondi–Hoyle flow and the feedback process is approximated through radiation pressure. We observe that while some of the evolving protostars possibly grow massive (≈1–75 M⊙) via accretion and mergers, a fraction of them (≈20%) are likely to be ejected from the parent cloud with a mass corresponding to M* ≲ 0.8 M⊙. These low-mass protostars may be considered as the potential candidates to enter the zero-age-main-sequence phase and possibly survive until the present epoch.

Gravitational wave searches are crucial for studying compact sources such as neutron stars and black holes. Many sensitive modeled searches use matched filtering to compare gravitational strain data to a set of waveform models known as template banks. We introduce a new stochastic placement method for constructing template banks, offering efficiency and flexibility to handle arbitrary parameter spaces, including orbital eccentricity, tidal deformability, and other extrinsic parameters. This method can be computationally limited by the ability to compare proposal templates with the accepted templates in the bank. To alleviate this computational load, we introduce the use of inner product inequalities to reduce the number of required comparisons. We also introduce a novel application of Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation to enhance waveform coverage in sparser regions. Our approach has been employed to search for eccentric binary neutron stars, low-mass neutron stars, primordial black holes, and supermassive black hole binaries. We demonstrate that our method produces self-consistent banks that recover the required minimum fraction of signals. For common parameter spaces, our method shows comparable computational performance and similar template bank sizes to geometric placement methods and stochastic methods, while easily extending to higher-dimensional problems. The time to run a search exceeds the time to generate the bank by a factor of for dedicated template banks, such as geometric, mass-only stochastic, and aligned spin cases, for eccentric and for the tidal deformable bank. With the advent of efficient template bank generation, the primary area for improvement is developing more efficient search methodologies.

We present the analysis of 200 ks NuSTAR observation of the Vela pulsar and the pulsar wind nebula (PWN). The phase-resolved spectra corresponding to two main peaks in the folded pulse profile differ significantly. The spectrum of Peak 1 is significantly harder than that of Peak 2 in qualitative agreement with the earlier Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer results. However, for both spectra, the values of power-law (PL) fit photon indices, Γ, are noticeably larger than the previously reported values. The harder (Peak 1) spectrum has Γ = 1.10 ± 0.15, which is close to those measured for the bright inner jets of the PWN. We used the off-pulse interval to remove the emission from the pulsar and measure the compact PWN spectrum in hard X-rays. We also measured the spectrum from the southwestern region of the PWN, which is resolved by NuSTAR from the compact PWN. For both regions, we fit the NuSTAR spectra by themselves and together with the Chandra X-ray Observatory spectra. We found that the PWN spectrum (for both regions) requires a more complex model than a simple PL. The fits to compact PWN spectrum favor an exponentially cutoff PL model, with Ec ≈ 50 keV over the broken PL model. The observed synchrotron photon energies imply electrons accelerated to ≈150 TeV.

Studies of surface brightness (SB) fluctuations in the intracluster medium present an indirect estimate of turbulent pressure support and associated Mach numbers. While high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy can directly constrain line-of-sight gas motions, including those due to turbulence, such observations are relatively expensive and will be limited to nearby, bright clusters. In this respect, SB fluctuations are the most economical means to constrain turbulent motions at large cluster radii across a range of redshifts and masses. To forecast what current and future X-ray and Sunyaev–Zel’dovich facilities may achieve in SB fluctuation studies, I review and synthesize matters of accuracy and precision with respect to calculating power spectra of SB fluctuations, from which turbulent properties are derived. Balancing concerns of power spectrum accuracy and precision across a range of spatial scales, I propose the use of three annuli with [0, 0.4]R500, [0.4, 1]R500, and [1, 1.5]R500. Adopting these three regions, I calculate the uncertainty in the hydrostatic mass bias, , that can be achieved for various instruments in several scenarios. I find that Lynx and AtLAST are competitive in their constraints at R500, while AtLAST should perform better when constraining at R200.

The C iv doublet in the UV has long been associated with accretion in T Tauri stars. However, it is still unclear where and how the lines are formed. Here, we present a new C iv line model based on the currently available accretion shock and accretion flow models. We assume axisymmetric, dipolar accretion flows with different energy fluxes and calculate the properties of the accretion shock. We use Cloudy to obtain the carbon level populations and calculate the emerging line profiles assuming a plane-parallel geometry near the shock. Our model generally reproduces the intensities and shapes of the C iv emission lines observed from T Tauri stars. We find that the narrow component is optically thin and originates in the postshock, while the broad component is optically thick and emerges from the preshock. We apply our model to seven T Tauri stars from the Hubble Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards Director’s Discretionary program (ULLYSES), for which the consistently determined accretion shock properties are available. We can reproduce the observations of four stars, finding that the accretion flows are carbon-depleted. We also find that the chromospheric emission accounts for less than 10% of the observed C iv line flux in accreting T Tauri stars. This work paves the way toward a better understanding of hot line formation and provides a potential probe of abundances in the inner disk.

新研究提出常见包络(CE)可能是许多新星早期爆发后光谱的起源。研究基于包络的发射线强度和假设的密度分布提出了一个简单的模型来解释包络的性质。快速的光谱变化被认为是CE的可能证据。来自ARAS小组的时间分辨光谱显示出突然的光谱移动，与探测到的γ射线发射相关，暗示着可能是在产生光谱变化的白矮星上。可能由γ射线引起的间歇性物质流失、瞬变重元素吸收系统的形成和包络的消散。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究提出了CE可能是许多新星早期爆发后光谱的起源，提出了一个简单的模型来解释CE的性质，指出快速的光谱变化可能是CE的证据，还观测到光谱移动与γ射线发射相关，可能是白矮星条件改变的迹象，同时还可能由γ射线引起的间歇性物质流失、瞬变重元素吸收系统的形成和CE的消散。 <div>
A common envelope (CE) is proposed as the origin of the early post-outburst spectra of many novae. A simple model is proposed to explain the properties of the CE based on the emission line strengths and an assumed density distribution. Rapid changes in the spectrum during post-outburst decline are suggested as possible evidence for a CE. Time-resolved spectra from the ARAS group show sudden spectral shifts that are correlated with detected γ-ray emission, suggestive of its possible origin on the white dwarf that produces a change in condition within the CE. Episodic mass loss, formation of transient heavy element absorption systems, and dissipation of the CE may possibly be triggered by γ-ray emission.

<div> 重复快速射电暴（FRBs），等待时间统计，时间间隔依赖性，内存效应，尺度不变的等待时间分布

FRB的重复性与非重复性现象可能都受到时间间隔的内存依赖性影响。研究发现等待时间与上一个时间间隔（λ0）呈现显著的依赖关系，短等待时间后更可能出现下一个短等待时间，而长等待时间后更可能出现下一个长等待时间。这种内存效应还影响了在给定时间窗口内观测到下一个FRB的可能性。研究首次发现了这种内存效应存在于尺度不变的等待时间分布中。这些发现为揭示FRBs的机制提供了新的线索。 <br /><br />总结: FRB的重复与非重复现象可能都受到等待时间的内存依赖性影响，短等待时间更可能后续也是短等待时间，长等待时间也更可能后续是长等待时间。内存效应还影响了在给定时间窗口内观测到下一个FRB的可能性。这种内存效应首次被发现存在于尺度不变的等待时间分布中，为揭示FRBs的机制提供了新的线索。 <div>
Understanding the nature of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) is crucial for probing their underlying physics. In this work, we analyze the waiting time statistics between bursts of three repeating FRBs from four data sets. We find a universally pronounced dependency of the waiting times on the previous time interval (denoted as λ0). We observe a temporal clustering, where short waiting times tend to be followed by short ones and long by long, comparative to their mean value. This memory dependency is manifested in the conditional mean waiting time as well as in the conditional mean residual time to the next burst, both of which increase in direct proportion to λ0. Consequently, the likelihood of experiencing a subsequent FRB burst within a given time window after the preceding burst is generally influenced by the burst history. We reveal, for the first time, that these memory effects are present in the scale-invariant preconditioned waiting time distribution. We show that the memory effect provides a unified description of waiting times that may account for both the repeating FRBs and the apparently nonrepeating FRBs (i.e., those only observed one time). These results shed new light on the mechanism of FRBs.

总结: 
这篇文章报告了对高同步辐射峰(HSP)类星体Mrk 421的X射线和光学偏振测量的观测结果。他们使用IXPE进行了X射线偏振观测，并在同一时间进行了光学偏振观测。结果显示，X射线和光学波段都检测到了偏振信号，而且发现随着能量的降低，偏振程度逐渐减小。研究人员认为这支持了一个假设，即偏振程度变化的原因可能是不同辐射区域的空间延伸差异。同时，他们还通过对X射线和光学数据进行宽带能谱能量分布建模来支持这一假设。这些结果对于理解HSP类星体的辐射机制提供了宝贵信息。 <br /><br /> <div>
We present near-simultaneous X-ray and optical polarization measurements in the high synchrotron peaked (HSP) blazar Mrk 421. The X-ray polarimetric observations were carried out using Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) on 2023 December 6. During IXPE observations, we also carried out optical polarimetric observations using 104 cm Sampurnanand telescope at Nainital and multiband optical imaging observations using 2 m Himalayan Chandra Telescope at Hanle. From model-independent analysis of IXPE data, we detected X-ray polarization with degree of polarization (ΠX) of 8.5% ± 0.5% and an electric vector position angle (ΨX) of 10.°6 ± 1.°7 in the 2−8 keV band. From optical polarimetry on 2023 December 6, in B, V, and R bands, we found values of ΠB = 4.27% ± 0.32%, ΠV = 3.57% ± 0.31%, and ΠR = 3.13% ± 0.25%. The value of ΠB is greater than that observed at longer optical wavelengths, with the degree of polarization suggesting an energy-dependent trend, gradually decreasing from higher to lower energies. This is consistent with that seen in other HSP blazars and favors a stratified emission region encompassing a shock front. The emission happening in the vicinity of the shock front will be more polarized due to the ordered magnetic field resulting from shock compression. The X-ray emission, involving high-energy electrons, originates closer to the shock front than the optical emission. The difference in the spatial extension could plausibly account for the observed variation in polarization between X-ray and optical wavelengths. This hypothesis is further supported by the broadband spectral energy distribution modeling of the X-ray and optical data.

总结: <br />
这篇文章使用JWST MIRI中分辨率光谱仪对SN 2021aefx进行了观测，并结合之前的观测数据，进行了第一次JWST时间序列分析。通过对[Co iii] 11.888 μm特征的分析追踪了56Co的衰变。作者分析了光谱、线型和其演化，并使用偏心延迟爆炸模型进行了拟合。他们发现最佳拟合为白矮星中心密度ρc = 0.9−1.1 × 109 g cm−3，白矮星质量MWD = 1.33–1.35 M⊙，白矮星磁场≈106 G，以及一个约0.5 M⊙的偏心爆燃模型。文章还讨论了电子俘获核心和正电子沉积的影响，以及对光谱特征的改变。最后，分析显示这次超新星爆发是由单个点近中心点燃，排除了多点偏离中心的点燃模型。 <div>
We present a JWST MIRI medium-resolution spectrometer spectrum (5–27 μm) of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2021aefx at +415 days past B-band maximum. The spectrum, which was obtained during the iron-dominated nebular phase, has been analyzed in combination with previous JWST observations of SN 2021aefx to provide the first JWST time series analysis of an SN Ia. We find that the temporal evolution of the [Co iii] 11.888 μm feature directly traces the decay of 56Co. The spectra, line profiles, and their evolution are analyzed with off-center delayed-detonation models. Best fits were obtained with white dwarf (WD) central densities of ρc = 0.9−1.1 × 109 g cm−3, a WD mass of MWD = 1.33–1.35 M⊙, a WD magnetic field of ≈106 G, and an off-center deflagration-to-detonation transition at ≈0.5 M⊙ seen opposite to the line of sight of the observer (−30°). The inner electron capture core is dominated by energy deposition from γ-rays, whereas a broader region is dominated by positron deposition, placing SN 2021aefx at +415 days in the transitional phase of the evolution to the positron-dominated regime. The formerly “flat-tilted” profile at 9 μm now has a significant contribution from [Ni iv], [Fe ii], and [Fe iii] and less from [Ar iii], which alters the shape of the feature as positrons mostly excite the low-velocity Ar. Overall, the strength of the stable Ni features in the spectrum is dominated by positron transport rather than the Ni mass. Based on multidimensional models, our analysis is consistent with a single-spot, close-to-central ignition with an indication of a preexisting turbulent velocity field and excludes a multiple-spot, off-center ignition.

本研究基于事件视界望远镜观测到的M87*图像，提出了一种构建多种不同偏好的先验的框架。这些先验可以是弱先验（仅强调基本自然图像统计）或强先验（对黑洞结构做出假设）。该框架使用基于得分的先验的贝叶斯推断，这些先验源自于可以学习复杂图像分布的深度生成模型。借助我们的贝叶斯成像方法和复杂的数据驱动先验，我们可以评估重建图像的视觉特征和不确定性，以及它们如何取决于先验的选择。除了模拟数据外，我们还对真实的EHT M87*数据进行了图像重建，并讨论了选择先验如何影响恢复的特征。 <br /><br />总结: <br />该研究提出了一种灵活设计不同偏好的图像重建先验的框架，使用贝叶斯推断和数据驱动的先验技术对黑洞图像进行重建，并讨论了先验选择对重建图像的影响。 <div>
Reconstructing images from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87, depends on a prior to impose desired image statistics. However, given the impossibility of directly observing black holes, there is no clear choice for a prior. We present a framework for flexibly designing a range of priors, each bringing different biases to the image reconstruction. These priors can be weak (e.g., impose only basic natural-image statistics) or strong (e.g., impose assumptions of black hole structure). Our framework uses Bayesian inference with score-based priors, which are data-driven priors arising from a deep generative model that can learn complicated image distributions. Using our Bayesian imaging approach with sophisticated data-driven priors, we can assess how visual features and uncertainty of reconstructed images change depending on the prior. In addition to simulated data, we image the real EHT M87* data and discuss how recovered features are influenced by the choice of prior.

这篇文章研究了TeV J2032+4130，一个高能γ射线源，发现它实际上是一个脉冲星风星雲，由PSR J2032+4127驱动。研究发现HAWC J2031+415其实是一个γ射线双星系统，包含脉冲星PSR J2032+4127和其伴星MT91 213。研究团队结合了射电、X射线和γ射线的数据进行了多波段分析，最终确认了这一发现。2017年他们也观测到了这一系统的近日点。总结: 这项研究确认了TeV J2032+4130源实际上是由PSR J2032+4127驱动的脉冲星风星雲，而HAWC J2031+415是一个γ射线双星系统，这一发现得到了多波段数据的验证。 <div>
The first TeV γ-ray source with no lower energy counterparts, TeV J2032+4130, was discovered by HEGRA. It appears in the third HAWC catalog as 3HWC J2031+415 and it is a bright TeV γ-ray source whose emission has previously been resolved as two sources: HAWC J2031+415 and HAWC J2030+409. While HAWC J2030+409 has since been associated with the Fermi Large Area Telescope Cygnus Cocoon, no such association for HAWC J2031+415 has yet been found. In this work, we investigate the spectrum and energy-dependent morphology of HAWC J2031+415. We associate HAWC J2031+415 with a γ-ray binary system containing the pulsar PSR J2032+4127 and its companion MT91 213. We study HAWC data to observe their periastron in 2017. Additionally, we perform a combined multiwavelength analysis using radio, X-ray, and γ-ray emission. We conclude that HAWC J2031+415 and, by extension, TeV J2032+4130 are most probably a pulsar wind nebula powered by PSR J2032+4127.

黑洞候选者Swift J1727.8-1613是近期发现的一个明亮的瞬变物体，利用NICER和NuSTAR联合数据，研究了其在0.5-79 keV的广泛能量范围内的特性。在0.5-10 keV的NICER数据中观察到了0.89±0.01 Hz的显著C型准周期振荡（QPO）及其谐波。有趣的是，在更低的能量范围内，谐波变得较弱（0.5-1和1-3 keV）。同时，在NICER / X射线定时仪观测中首次发现了硬（3-10 keV）和软（0.5-3 keV）波段光子之间在QPO频率处的软时间滞后为0.014±0.001 s。这表明该双星系统中的吸积盘倾斜角可能较高。从详细的能谱分析中，使用relxill反射模型发现了源的盘倾斜角约为85°。文章讨论了通过能谱分析得出的吸积流配置如何帮助我们理解此源中QPO和软滞后的起源。<br /><br />总结：黑洞候选者Swift J1727.8-1613在0.5-79 keV的广泛能量范围内观测到了C型准周期振荡和其谐波，以及硬和软光子之间的软时间滞后，这表明了源的盘倾斜角可能较高。能谱分析揭示了吸积流配置，有助于我们理解QPO和软滞后的来源。 <div>
The recently discovered bright transient black hole candidate Swift J1727.8-1613 is studied in a broad energy range (0.5–79 keV) using combined NICER and NuSTAR data taken on 2023 August 29. A prominent type C quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) at 0.89 ± 0.01 Hz with its harmonic was observed in NICER data of 0.5–10 keV. Interestingly, the harmonic becomes weaker in the lower energy bands (0.5–1 and 1–3 keV). We also report the first detection of a soft time lag of 0.014 ± 0.001 s at the QPO frequency between harder (3–10 keV) and softer (0.5–3 keV) band photons observed with the NICER/X-ray timing instrument. This indicates that the inclination of the accretion disk in the binary system might be high. From the detailed spectral analysis with the relxill reflection model, we found the disk inclination angle of the source to be ∼85°. We discuss how the accretion flow configuration inferred from spectral analysis can help us understand the origin of QPOs and soft lag in this source.

总结:<br />
文章利用交叉相关技术推断宇宙的哈勃常数(H0)，使用来自第三个GW瞬变目录(GWTC-3)和光度星系调查2MPZ、WISE-SuperCOSMOS的引力波(GW)源暗信号(暗灵音)，并结合来自GW170817的明亮灵音测量的H0。只使用暗灵音的H0后验因为定位良好的GW源数量较少而信息含量不足。使用八个定位良好的暗灵音和具有电磁对应的双中子星GW170817，经过边缘化处理，在物质密度和GW偏差参数上获得H0的值为 km s−1 Mpc−1 (中值和68.3%的双尾区间)。这一测量主要受明亮灵音测量的影响，暗灵音的任何约束都没有统计学显著性。未来，随着更多定位良好的GW事件，对宇宙膨胀历史的约束将会得到改善。 <div>
We apply the cross-correlation technique to infer the Hubble constant (H0) of the Universe using gravitational-wave (GW) sources without electromagnetic counterparts (dark sirens) from the third GW Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) and the photometric galaxy surveys 2MPZ and WISE-SuperCOSMOS, and combine these with the bright siren measurement of H0 from GW170817. The posterior on H0 with only dark sirens is uninformative due to the small number of well-localized GW sources. Using the eight well-localized dark sirens and the binary neutron star GW170817 with electromagnetic counterpart, we obtain a value of the Hubble constant km s−1 Mpc−1 (median and 68.3% equal-tailed interval) after marginalizing over the matter density and the GW bias parameters. This measurement is mostly driven by the bright siren measurement, and any constraint from dark sirens is not statistically significant. In the future, with more well-localized GW events, the constraints on expansion history will improve.

It has been widely accepted that mass-accreting white dwarfs (WDs) are the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe) or electron-capture supernovae. Previous work has shown that the accretion rate could affect the elemental abundance on the outer layers of CO WDs, and therefore affect the observational characteristics after they exploded as SNe Ia. However, it has not been well studied how elemental abundance changes on the outer layers of He-accreting ONe WDs as they approach the Chandrasekhar mass limit. In this paper, we investigated the evolution of He-accreting ONe WDs with MESA. We found that a CO-rich mantle will accumulate beneath the He layers resulting from the He burning, after which the ignition of the CO-rich mantle could transform carbon into silicon (Si). The amount of Si produced by carbon burning is strongly anticorrelated with the accretion rate. As the ONe WD nearly approaches the Chandrasekhar mass limit (Mch) through accretion, it is likely to undergo accretion-induced collapse, resulting in the formation of a neutron star.

M-type stars are the most abundant stars in our Galaxy. Their visible spectra are characterized by strong TiO and VO absorption bands with occasional ScO bands near 6000–6100 Å. This region corresponds to the A2Π–X2Σ+ band system and can be used to measure the abundance of ScO. In this work, a new Doppler-limited resolution spectrum of ScO obtained in a hollow-cathode experiment is presented. The A2Π–X2Σ+ electronic transition is analyzed with special care dedicated to fitting the ∼ A2Π(v) perturbation. Spectroscopic constants of the A2Π(v) states are reported for v ≤ 9, and a partial fit of spectroscopic constants is made for the states 2 ≤ v ≤ 6. The modeled interaction of the two states reproduces the experimental data remarkably well. New equilibrium constants are extracted from the fit. Band strengths are calculated with the help of a scaled transition dipole moment function, previously calculated with ab initio methods. Finally, a line list of the A2Π–X2Σ+ band system is provided, including Einstein A coefficients and oscillator strengths. Using this line list, the spectrum of ScO can be simulated for different temperature and pressure conditions in stellar atmospheres.

总结:
JWST TEMPLATES Early Release Science program使用了两个通过引力透镜效应得到的星系的综合光谱，分析了微弱的光谱线，从而直接测量了气相化学丰度。对亮的星系SGAS1723+34 (z = 1.3293)检测到了[O iii] λ4363, [S iii] λ6312, 和[O ii] λλ7320, 7330的发射线，并设定了[N ii] λ5755的上限。对第二个星系SGAS1226+21 (z = 2.925)，没有检测到任何的光谱线，报告了上限。利用这些测量和上限，对这两个星系的不同电离区域内的电子温度进行了限制。对于检测到光谱线的SGAS1723+34星系，计算了直接的氧和氮的丰度，发现了与附近星系观测（z∼0）一致的N/O比值。这些观测凸显了JWST和引力透镜的强大结合，用于测量远距离星系中微弱的发射线，并直接研究这些星系中的化学丰度模式。 <div>
Using integrated spectra for two gravitationally lensed galaxies from the JWST TEMPLATES Early Release Science program, we analyze faint auroral lines, which provide direct measurements of the gas-phase chemical abundance. For the brighter galaxy, SGAS1723+34 (z = 1.3293), we detect the [O iii] λ4363, [S iii] λ6312, and [O ii] λλ7320, 7330 auroral emission lines, and set an upper limit for the [N ii] λ5755 line. For the second galaxy, SGAS1226+21 (z = 2.925), we do not detect any auroral lines, and report upper limits. With these measurements and upper limits, we constrain the electron temperatures in different ionization zones within both of these galaxies. For SGAS1723+34, where auroral lines are detected, we calculate direct oxygen and nitrogen abundances, finding an N/O ratio consistent with observations of nearby (z ∼ 0) galaxies. These observations highlight the potent combination of JWST and gravitational lensing to measure faint emission lines in individual distant galaxies and to directly study the chemical abundance patterns in those galaxies.

Pulse profile modeling (PPM), the technique used to infer mass, radius, and geometric parameters for rotation-powered millisecond pulsars using data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), relies on relativistic ray-tracing of thermal X-ray photons from hot spots on the neutron star surface to the observer. To verify our ray-tracing codes we have in the past conducted cross tests for simple hot spot geometries, focusing primarily on the implementation of the spacetime model. In this paper, we present verification for test problems that explore the more complex hot spot geometries that are now being employed in the NICER PPM analyses. We conclude that the accuracy of our computed waveforms is in general sufficiently high for analyses of current NICER data sets. We have however identified some extreme configurations where extra care may be needed.

<div> 超团、宇宙演化、FoF算法、高红移、光度红移不确定性

超团是研究星系演化的独特实验室，但现有超团目录多集中在红移z=0.7以下。本研究采用物理定义的超团概念，利用FoF算法在Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam测绘数据中搜索了z=0.5-1.0的超团，并鉴定了1027平方度范围内的673个超团候选体。这些高红移超团通常由2到4个星系团组成，表明在年轻的宇宙中，引力束缚结构的极限。此外，研究了不同大尺度环境中的星系团和最亮星系团星系（BCG）的特性，发现与超团相关的星系团通常更丰富，但BCG的特性并未显示出明显的大尺度结构依赖性。比较了观测到的超团丰度与来自晕体光锥的模拟超团，发现光度红移的不确定性是影响超团检测性能的一个限制因素。<br /><br />总结: 本研究使用FoF算法在高红移范围内鉴定了673个超团候选体，并发现了它们多由2到4个星系团组成，展示出了年轻宇宙中引力束缚结构的极限。另外，研究了不同大尺度环境中的星系团和BCG的特性，发现了一些有趣的结果，同时也指出了光度红移不确定性对超团检测性能的限制。 <div>
Superclusters, encompassing environments across a wide range of overdensities, can be regarded as unique laboratories for studying galaxy evolution. Although numerous supercluster catalogs have been published, none of them goes beyond redshift z = 0.7. In this work, we adopt a physically motivated supercluster definition, requiring that superclusters should eventually collapse even in the presence of dark energy. Applying a friends-of-friends (FoF) algorithm to the CAMIRA cluster sample constructed using the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam survey data, we have conducted the first systematic search for superclusters at z = 0.5–1.0 and identified 673 supercluster candidates over an area of 1027 deg2. The FoF algorithm is calibrated by evolving N-body simulations to the far future to ensure high purity. We found that these high-z superclusters are mainly composed of two to four clusters, suggesting the limit of gravitationally bound structures in the younger Universe. In addition, we studied the properties of the clusters and brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) residing in different large-scale environments. We found that clusters associated with superclusters are typically richer, but no apparent dependence of the BCG properties on large-scale structures is found. We also compared the abundance of observed superclusters with mock superclusters extracted from halo light cones, finding that photometric redshift uncertainty is a limiting factor in the performance of superclusters detection.

<title>An Empirical Calibration of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch Distance Method in the Near Infrared. II. JWST NIRCam Wide Filters</title>

<div> 关键词: TRGB, Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, 红巨星分支, 确定距离<br />
总结:本文介绍了红巨星分支顶端（TRGB）作为一个可以标准化的蜡烛，用来测量星系的距离。通过使用Hubble Space Telescope和James Webb Space Telescope的近红外摄像头，可以扩展到约50 Mpc的距离范围。此外，文章还提到了通过颜色来校正TRGB的亮度，推荐了适合不同精度要求的滤波器。与此相关的科学研究需要高精度的测量，可以使用特定滤波器对TRGB进行测量，并且远距离需要更长的观测时间。如果可以接受较低的精度或者需要较短的观测时间，还有其他滤波器可供选择。由于分辨率较低，不推荐使用某些滤波器进行精确的TRGB测量。 <div>
The tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) is a standardizable candle, identifiable as the discontinuity at the bright extreme of the red giant branch (RGB) stars in color–magnitude diagram space. The TRGB-based distance method has been used to measure distances to galaxies out to D ≤ 20 Mpc with the Hubble Space Telescope F814W filter, and is an important rung in the distance ladder to measure the Hubble constant, H0. In the infrared (IR), the TRGB apparent magnitude ranges from 1–2 mag brighter than in the optical. Now with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the feasible distance range of the TRGB method can reach ∼50 Mpc. However, the IR TRGB luminosity depends to varying degrees on stellar metallicity/age. Here we standardize the TRGB luminosity using stellar colors as a proxy for metallicity/age to derive color-based corrections for the JWST Near-Infrared Camera short-wavelength filters F090W, F115W, and F150W, and the long-wavelength filters F277W, F356W, and F444W. We provide recommended filters for distance measurements depending on the requisite precision. For science requiring high precision (≤1% in distance), we recommend measuring the TRGB in F090W versus F090W − F150W or F115W versus F115W − F277W with the caveat that even with JWST, long integration times will be necessary at farther distances. If lower precision (>1.5% in distance) can be tolerated, or if shorter integration times are desirable, we recommend measuring the TRGB in either F115W or F150W. We do not recommend F444W for precision TRGB measurements due to its lower angular resolution.

<div> 红移、紫外选取的星系、低质量黑暗物质暗物质晕、紫外光度函数、星际中的物理过程
总结: 通过简单的分析模型，文章探讨了质量相关的随机性对高红移星系的影响。随着暗物质暗物质晕质量的降低，紫外光度函数呈现出增长的趋势，而星系的聚集程度下降。同时，文章强调了星系中星形成的突发性，对离子化光子预算和再电离过程的影响。文章还提出了一些预测，如在固定紫外光度下，星系的紫外斜率、星际发射线强度和巴尔默断裂将呈现宽广的变化范围。研究表明，质量相关的随机性模型成功地复现了观测到的紫外光度函数，但无法匹配观测到的最高红移处的光度函数，这暗示了在最早期的星系中存在其他物理过程增强了星形成效率。 <div>
The James Webb Space Telescope is unveiling a surprising lack of evolution in the number densities of ultraviolet (UV)-selected galaxies at redshift z ≳ 10. At the same time, observations and simulations are providing evidence for highly bursty star formation in high-z galaxies, resulting in significant scatter in their UV luminosities. Galaxies in low-mass dark matter halos are expected to experience most stochasticity due to their shallow potential wells. Here, we explore the impact of a mass-dependent stochasticity using a simple analytical model. We assume that scatter in the MUV–Mh relation increases toward lower halo masses, following the decrease in halo escape velocity, , independent of redshift. Since low-mass halos are more dominant in the early universe, this model naturally predicts an increase in UV luminosity functions (LFs) at high redshifts compared to models without scatter. We make predictions for additional observables, which would be affected by stochasticity and could be used to constrain its amplitude, finding (i) galaxies are less clustered compared to the no-scatter scenario, with the difference increasing at higher-z; (ii) assuming that star-bursting galaxies dominate the ionizing photon budget implies reionization starts earlier and is more gradual compared to the no-scatter case; (iii) at fixed UV magnitude, galaxies should exhibit wide ranges of UV slopes, nebular emission line strengths, and Balmer breaks. Comparing to observations, the mass-dependent stochasticity model successfully reproduces the observed LFs up to z ∼ 12. However, the model cannot match the observed z ∼ 14 LFs, implying additional physical processes enhance star formation efficiency in the earliest galaxies.

总结: <br /><br />这篇文章报道了对黑洞X射线暂现体GX 339-4的光谱-时间分析，使用了AstroSat和NICER的同时观测数据。研究发现，源处于低/硬态，具有光子指数约为1.64。能谱组合包括热盘组分、硬康普顿化组分和带边的反射组分。功率密度谱显示两个显著的特征频率，在0.22赫兹和2.94赫兹附近。能量相关的时间滞后和均方根分数显示硬滞后以及在较高能量水平下的变异性减少。研究还发现，与加速率、内盘半径、冠加热率和散射分数之间相关的变化，以及它们之间的延迟，可以解释所观察的均方根和滞后谱。 <div>
We present a spectro-timing analysis of the black hole X-ray transient GX 339–4 using simultaneous observations from AstroSat and the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) during the 2021 outburst period. The combined spectrum obtained from NICER, Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter and SXT data is effectively described by a model comprising a thermal disk component, hard Comptonization component, and reflection component with an edge. Our analysis of the AstroSat and NICER spectra indicates the source to be in a low/hard state, with a photon index of ∼1.64. The power density spectra obtained from both AstroSat and NICER observations exhibit two prominent broad features at 0.22 Hz and 2.94 Hz. We generated energy-dependent time lag and fractional root mean square (frms) at both frequencies in a broad energy range of 0.5–30 keV and found the presence of hard lags along with a decrease in variability at higher energy levels. Additionally, we discovered that the correlated variations in accretion rate, inner disk radius, coronal heating rate, and the scattering fraction, along with a delay between them, can explain the observed frms and lag spectra for both features.

<div> 星系、星形成、尘埃性质、光谱能量分布、MOSDEF调查
总结:
该研究通过将660个星系分成具有类似光谱能量分布（SEDs）形状的组，进行星系的光度测量和光谱叠加分析。通过该方法，研究包括了具有非常微弱发射线的星系样本，可以利用Prospector模型测量星体衰减和SED-based星形成速率（SFRs），并从光谱叠加中导出发射线特性，包括巴尔默衰减、尘埃校正的SFR和金属丰度。研究发现恒星衰减主要与质量相关，而星云衰减则与质量和SFR都有较强的相关性。此外，高SFR组的星云衰减过剩与SFR最强烈关联，最高SFR组有2等星等的星云衰减过剩。研究结果与一个模型一致，即随着星系质量的增加，星形成区域变得更加多尘。除此之外，随着每个星系组代表不同的演化阶段，研究了它们在UVJ图和SFR-质量图上的位置。随着质量的增加，金属丰度和尘埃衰减增加，而比星形成速率（sSFR）减少。然而，最大质量的组移向UVJ图中宁静区域，同时表现出较少的遮挡，可能表示了尘埃的去除。 <div>
We examine star formation and dust properties for a sample of 660 galaxies at 1.37 ≤ z ≤ 2.61 in the MOSDEF survey by dividing them into groups with similarly shaped spectral energy distributions (SEDs). For each group, we combine the galaxy photometry into a finely sampled composite SED, and stack their spectra. This method enables the study of more complete galaxy samples, including galaxies with very faint emission lines. We fit these composite SEDs with Prospector to measure the stellar attenuation and SED-based star formation rates (SFRs). We also derive emission-line properties from the spectral stacks, including Balmer decrements, dust-corrected SFRs, and metallicities. We find that stellar attenuation correlates most strongly with mass, while nebular attenuation correlates strongly with both mass and SFR. Furthermore, the excess of nebular compared to stellar attenuation correlates most strongly with SFR. The highest SFR group has 2 mag of excess nebular attenuation. Our results are consistent with a model in which star-forming regions become more dusty as galaxy mass increases. To explain the increasing excess nebular attenuation, we require a progressively larger fraction of star formation to occur in highly obscured regions with increasing SFR. This highly obscured star formation could occur in dusty clumps or central starbursts. Additionally, as each galaxy group represents a different evolutionary stage, we study their locations on the UVJ and SFR-mass diagrams. As mass increases, metallicity and dust attenuation increase, while sSFR decreases. However, the most massive group moves towards the quiescent region of the UVJ diagram, while showing less obscuration, potentially indicating removal of dust.

The observed dispersion measures (DMs) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a good indicator of the amount of ionized material along the propagation paths. In this work, we present a forecast of He ii reionization detection using the DM and redshift measurements of FRBs from the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Assuming a model of the Universe in which He ii reionization occurred at a specific redshift , we analyze what extent the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for the detection of the amplitude of reionization can be achieved in the era of SKA. Using 106 mock FRB data from a 1 year observation of the second phase of SKA, we find that the S/N for detecting He ii reionization can approach the 32–50σ level, and the uncertainty on the reionization redshift can be constrained to be , depending on the assumed FRB redshift distribution. This is the first quantitative analysis on the detection significance of He ii reionization in the SKA era. We also examine the influence of different fiducial values, finding that this effect has a modest impact on the forecasts. Our results demonstrate the potentially remarkable capability of SKA-era FRBs in constraining the epoch of He ii reionization.

Ethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH) has recently been identified in the molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027, situated in the SgrB2 complex in the Galactic center. However, its presence in other regions, and in particular in star-forming sites, is still elusive. Given its likely role as a precursor to simple amino acids, understanding its presence in the star-forming region is required. Here, we present the experimentally obtained temperature-dependent spectral features and morphological behavior of pure ethanolamine ices under astrochemical conditions in the 2–12 μm (MIR) and 120–230 nm (VUV) regions for the first time. These features would help in understanding its photochemical behavior. In addition, we present the first chemical models specifically dedicated to ethanolamine. These models include all the discussed chemical routes from the literature, along with the estimated binding energies and activation energies from quantum chemical calculations reported in this work. We have found that surface reactions CH2OH + NH2CH2 → NH2CH2CH2OH and NH2 + C2H4OH → NH2CH2CH2OH in warmer regions (60–90 K) could play a significant role in the formation of ethanolamine. Our modeled abundance of ethanolamine complements the upper limit of ethanolamine column density estimated in earlier observations in hot core/corino regions. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical estimation of the rotational and distortional constants for various species (such as HNCCO, NH2CHCO, and NH2CH2CO) related to ethanolamine that have not been studied in existing literature. This study could be valuable for identifying these species in the future.

这篇文章介绍了使用GADGET4-Osaka平滑粒子流体动力学代码执行的新的宇宙学模拟数据集CROCODILE。该模拟包括了Y. Oku等人的更新的超新星（SN）反馈模型以及一个活动星系核（AGN）反馈模型。他们的SN反馈模型的一个关键创新是整合了一个与金属丰度和红移相关的、顶部丰富的初始质量函数。他们发现SN反馈是星系演化中化学丰度的关键驱动因素。另外，AGN反馈会产生富含金属的双极喷流，这些喷流会延伸并丰富几个兆秒差不多的尺度上的星系周围介质和星系间介质。他们进行了多种运行的比较，发现Fiducial运行与观测数据有很好的一致性，尤其是在星系恒星质量函数、星系形成主序和质量-金属丰度关系方面。这些结果为他们未来的工作奠定了坚实的基础。 <div>
We introduce our new cosmological simulation data set CROCODILE, executed using the GADGET4-Osaka smoothed particle hydrodynamics code. This simulation incorporates an updated supernova (SN) feedback model of Y. Oku et al. and an active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback model. A key innovation in our SN feedback model is the integration of a metallicity- and redshift-dependent, top-heavy initial mass function. Our SN model introduces a new consideration that results in an order of magnitude difference in the energy injection rate per unit stellar mass formed at high redshift. The CROCODILE data set is comprehensive, encompassing a variety of runs with diverse feedback parameters. This allows for an in-depth exploration of the relative impacts of different feedback processes in galactic evolution. Our initial comparisons with observational data, spanning the galaxy stellar mass function, the star formation main sequence, and the mass–metallicity relation, show promising agreement, especially for the Fiducial run. These results establish a solid foundation for our future work. We find that SN feedback is a key driver in the chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Additionally, the AGN feedback creates metal-rich, bipolar outflows that extend and enrich the circumgalactic medium and IGM over a few Mpc scales.

总结:<br /><br />这项研究对来自MaNGA Product Launch-11的1624个气质丰富的星系中的非圆形运动进行了系统研究。研究发现，非圆形运动的幅度与恒星质量相关，影响最大的是低质量和后期类型的星系。研究还发现，螺旋臂和恒星棒引起的非圆形运动并不会对Hα示踪的旋转曲线产生太大影响。因此，在样本中，我们并未发现非圆形运动对恒星Tully-Fisher关系的散射贡献很大。我们的结果表明，非圆形运动可能在星系中具有更局部化的影响，而不是全局性的影响。 <div>
Noncircular (NC) motions represent the imprints of nonaxisymmetric structures in galaxies, providing opportunities to study the physical properties of gas departing from circular rotation. In this work, we have conducted a systematic study of the NC motions in a sample of 1624 gas-rich disk galaxies from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (or MaNGA) Product Launch-11. By using the Hα velocity as a tracer of the disk rotation, we find indications that the amplitude of the NC motions is related to the stellar mass, with the low-mass and late-type galaxies the most affected. In our sample, we find ratios of circular to NC rotation ranging from 5% to 20%. By implementing harmonic models to include NC motions associated with spiral arms and stellar bars, we find that the rotational curves traced with Hα are barely affected by the NC motions induced by these structures. Consequently, in our sample, we do not find evidence that NC motions contribute to the scatter of the stellar Tully–Fisher relation. Our results suggest that NC motions might have a more localized effect in galaxies rather than a global one.

<br /><br />总结:
本文利用ALMA对NGC 384进行了CO(2-1)观测，发现其中心区域存在动力学扭曲。研究团队开发了扭曲盘的气体动力学模型并将其与观测数据吻合，发现该星系的H波段恒星质量-光度比为1.34 ± 0.01 [1σ统计] ±0.02 [系统] M⊙/L⊙，超大质量黑洞的质量在一定范围内。而与之前研究相比，NGC 384的结果显示其落在BH质量-星系球光度和BH质量-星系球质量关系的分散范围内。这表明NGC 384及其他局部紧凑星系可能是z∼2的红色小圆球的遗迹，而这些遗迹中超大质量黑洞的过质量化可能意味着黑洞的增长可能早于宿主星系的星群组装。这些发现可能挑战了以往的进化理论，并表明BH质量-星系关系中的分散可能比以前认为的更大。然而，这种分散可能被恒星和气体动力学测量方法之间的系统差异所放大，因此需要对NGC 384和其他局部紧凑星系进行直接比较。 <div>
We present 0.″22 resolution CO(2–1) observations of the circumnuclear gas disk in the local compact galaxy NGC 384 with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). While the majority of the disk displays regular rotation with projected velocities rising to 370 km s−1, the inner ∼0.″5 exhibits a kinematic twist. We develop warped disk gas-dynamical models to account for this twist, fit those models to the ALMA data cube, and find a stellar mass-to-light ratio in the H band of M/LH = 1.34 ± 0.01 [1σ statistical] ±0.02 [systematic] M⊙/L⊙ and a supermassive black hole (BH) mass (MBH) of MBH . In contrast to most previous dynamical MBH measurements in local compact galaxies, which typically found over-massive BHs compared to the local BH mass−bulge luminosity and BH mass−bulge mass relations, NGC 384 lies within the scatter of those scaling relations. NGC 384 and other local compact galaxies are likely relics of z ∼ 2 red nuggets, and over-massive BHs in these relics indicate BH growth may conclude before the host galaxy stars have finished assembly. Our NGC 384 results may challenge this evolutionary picture, suggesting there may be increased scatter in the scaling relations than previously thought. However, this scatter could be inflated by systematic differences between stellar- and gas-dynamical measurement methods, motivating direct comparisons between the methods for NGC 384 and the other compact galaxies in the sample.

这项研究利用James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)的数据发现了红移z≳4的遮挡尘埃的紧凑源，其中许多表现出活跃星系核（AGN）活动的迹象，这对于理解超大质量黑洞（SMBHs）的形成和它们与母星系的增长至关重要。研究人员对红移为4.13的GOODS-N领域的一种红色、明亮（MB∼-22.2等级）和紧凑（<500 pc）的源的低分辨率和中分辨率的JWST/NIRSpec光谱进行了分析。研究发现，该源的光学余辉（λrest > 4000 Å）明显由质量巨大（log10[M*/M⊙]∼10.6）、消光（log10[sSFR/yr−1]<−11）的星系主导，表现为明显的巴尔末断裂和恒星吸收线。星形成历史建模显示，大约20亿年前发生了一次星暴事件，随后迅速停止形成新的恒星。光谱显示出极为宽阔（FWHM∼2500 km s−1）的Hα发射线和高水平的光学谱线比，表明有一个正在活跃吞食物质的超大质量黑洞。此外，研究可能还首次通过检测到强烈的Lyα发射线和宽的Mg ii双峰在红的小点中揭示了明显的AGN特征。推导出的黑洞质量log10(MBH/M⊙)∼7.3结果表明MBH/M*∼0.04%，与当地关系一致，而其他高红移AGN的比值要高。最后，研究利用来自z=4-10的AGN的JWST数据探讨了高红移AGN、早期静止星系和当地椭圆星系之间的演化联系。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究利用JWST的数据发现了红移z≳4的遮挡尘埃的紧凑源，具有活跃星系核（AGN）活动迹象。研究表明，该源是一个质量巨大的消光星系，具有星暴事件和迅速停止形成恒星的特征。此外，其光谱显示出极宽的Hα发射线和高水平的光学谱线比，表明其中存在一个活跃的超大质量黑洞。这项研究还可能首次发现了明显的AGN特征，为理解高红移AGN、早期静止星系和当地椭圆星系之间的演化联系提供了重要线索。 <div>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a ubiquitous population of dust-obscured compact sources at z ≳ 4. Many of these objects exhibit signs of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, making their study crucial for understanding the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their growth with host galaxies. In this work, we examine low and medium-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectra from the JADES GTO public data release in the GOODS-N field of a red, luminous (MB ∼ −22.2 mag) and compact (<500 pc) source at z = 4.13. The rest-optical (λrest > 4000 Å) continuum of this source is strongly dominated by a massive (log10[M*/M⊙] ∼ 10.6), quenched (log10[sSFR/yr−1] < −11) galaxy, as indicated by the clear presence of a Balmer break and stellar absorption lines. Star formation history modeling reveals a starburst episode followed by rapid quenching about 200 Myr ago. The spectrum shows extremely broad (FWHM ∼2500 km s−1) Hα emission and elevated optical line ratios, indicating an actively accreting SMBH. Moreover, our work has potentially revealed clear AGN signatures in the rest-UV in little red dots for the first time via the detection of a strong Lyα emission and a broad Mg ii doublet. The derived black hole mass of log10(MBH/M⊙) ∼ 7.3 results in MBH/M* ∼ 0.04%, consistent with the local relations, unlike the elevated ratios in other high-z reddened AGN. Finally, we use JWST data from AGN at z = 4–10 to explore an evolutionary link between high-z reddened AGN, early quiescent galaxies, and local ellipticals.

<div> PAH, Spitzer, spectra, extinction, dust<br />
<br />总结:<br />这篇文章利用Spitzer的“隐藏”观测，构建了包含4090个光谱的目录，并研究了多环芳烃（PAH）分子及其与尘埃消光的关联。研究结果表明WISE12、E(B−V)和11.2μm的PAH带之间存在强烈的正相关关系。针对不同E(B−V)范围内，6.2μm、11.2μm和12.7μm的PAH带与E(B−V)之间的相关性也呈正相关。研究还揭示了三种尘埃温度区域。通过NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database的分解显示了6.2/11.2和PAH电离分数之间的正相关关系，而12.7/11.2稍微呈负相关，暗示了PAH结构的变化。综合光谱于五个E(B−V)和三个Tdust范围内的平均值显示了PAH发射的演变和12.7/11.2的变化。研究结果为JWST项目提供了指导。 <div>
Spitzer “hidden” observations of the background are used to construct a catalog of 4090 spectra and examine the signature of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules and their connection to extinction by dust. A strong positive correlation is recovered between WISE12, E(B − V), and the 11.2 μm PAH band. For 0.06 ≤ E(B − V) ≤ 5.0, correlations of the 6.2, 11.2, and 12.7 μm PAH band are positive with E(B − V). Three dust temperature regimes are revealed. Correlations with WISE12 are well constrained and that with 12.7/11.2 is flat. Decomposition with the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database reveals a tentative positive correlation between the 6.2/11.2 and the PAH ionization fraction, while that with 12.7/11.2 is slightly negative, suggesting PAH structural changes. The relation with PAH size and 6.2/11.2 is negative, while that with 12.7/11.2 is positive. Averaging spectra into five E(B − V) and three Tdust bins shows an evolution in PAH emission and variations in 12.7/11.2. Database-fits show an increase in fi and the PAH ionization parameter γ, but a more stable large PAH fraction. While the largest γs are associated with the highest Tdust, there is no one-to-one correlation. The analysis is hampered by low-quality data at short wavelengths. There are indications that PAHs in the more-diffuse backgrounds behave differently from those in the general interstellar medium. However, they are often still associated with larger scale filamentary cloud-like structures. The spectra and auxiliary data have been made available through the Ames Background Interstellar Medium Spectral Catalog and may guide JWST programs.

研究人员通过模拟太阳涡旋管的平衡构型，获得了MHD波的解，并得到了与MHD模式相关的Poynting flux的垂直分量Sz的表达式。他们展示了在不同背景流强度下，不同MHD模式下Sz的空间结构的二维可视化。研究发现，与无旋转流的磁通管相比，背景旋转流会增加Sz的数值。当背景流强度大于扰动的100倍时，非轴对称（∣m∣ > 0）模式的Sz会增加1000%以上。此外，研究还指出了太阳涡旋的一个基本特性，即它们不能单独在无扭曲的管道中产生向上的Poynting flux，这意味着在直通管中观察到的Sz必定源自于MHD波等扰动。 <br /><br />总结: <br />本研究通过模拟得到了太阳涡旋管的平衡构型以及MHD波的解，并研究了与MHD模式相关的Poynting flux。研究发现在背景旋转流的存在下，Poynting flux的数值会增加。此外，研究还发现太阳涡旋不能单独产生向上的Poynting flux，这些结果对理解太阳大气中磁场的输运过程具有重要意义。 <div>
Magnetic flux tubes in the presence of background rotational flows, known as solar vortex tubes, are abundant throughout the solar atmosphere and may act as conduits for MHD waves to transport magnetic energy to the upper solar atmosphere. We aim to investigate the Poynting flux associated with these waves within solar vortex tubes. We model a solar vortex tube as a straight magnetic flux tube with a background azimuthal velocity component. The MHD wave solutions in the equilibrium configuration of a vortex tube are obtained using the Shooting Eigensolver for SolAr Magnetohydrostatic Equilibria code and we derive an expression for the vertical component of the Poynting flux, Sz, associated with MHD modes. In addition, we present 2D visualizations of the spatial structure of Sz for different MHD modes under different background flow strengths. We show that Sz increases in the presence of a background rotational flow when compared to a flux tube with no rotational flow. When the strength of the background flow is greater than 100 times the strength of the perturbation, the Sz associated with non-axisymmetric (∣m∣ > 0) modes increases by over 1000% when compared to a magnetic flux tube in the absence of a background rotational flow. Furthermore, we present a fundamental property of solar vortices, namely that they cannot solely produce an upward Poynting flux in an untwisted tube, meaning that any observed Sz in straight flux tubes must arise from perturbations, such as MHD waves.

<title>Revisiting the Vertical Distribution of H i Absorbing Clouds in the Solar Neighborhood. II. Constraints from a Large Catalog of 21 cm Absorption Observations at High Galactic Latitudes</title>

<div> 关键词: 冷中性介质、CNM、银河演化、垂直分布、H i吸收观测

总结: 
本研究利用最近开发的动力学尺度高度软件包和大量敏感的H i吸收观测对冷中性介质（CNM）的垂直分布提供了新的约束。在太阳邻域，我们估计了CNM的厚度为σz∼50-90 pc，如果只考虑H i光学深度τ>0.1或柱密度N（H i）>1019.5 cm−2的结构，则厚度为σz∼50 pc。与最近的模拟结果一致，这显示了CNM在太阳邻域的厚度与内部银河中发现的相似。约20％的CNM结构被识别为异常值，这些异常值可能与当地泡士壁有关。我们的结果与最近的观测和模拟进行了比较，并讨论了它们对银河系星际介质的多相结构的影响。<br /><br /> <div>
The cold neutral medium (CNM) is where neutral atomic hydrogen (H i) is converted into molecular clouds, so the structure and kinematics of the CNM are key drivers of galaxy evolution. Here we provide new constraints on the vertical distribution of the CNM using the recently developed kinematic_scaleheight software package and a large catalog of sensitive H i absorption observations. We estimate the thickness of the CNM in the solar neighborhood to be σz ∼ 50–90 pc, assuming a Gaussian vertical distribution. This is a factor of ∼2 smaller than typically assumed, indicating that the thickness of the CNM in the solar neighborhood is similar to that found in the inner Galaxy, consistent with recent simulation results. If we consider only structures with H i optical depths τ > 0.1 or column densities N(H i) > 1019.5 cm−2, which recent work suggests are thresholds for molecule formation, we find σz ∼ 50 pc. Meanwhile, for structures with τ < 0.1 or column densities N(H i) < 1019.5 cm−2, we find σz ∼ 120 pc. These thicknesses are similar to those derived for the thin- and thick-disk molecular cloud populations traced by CO emission, possibly suggesting that cold H i and CO are well mixed. Approximately 20% of CNM structures are identified as outliers, with kinematics that are not well explained by Galactic rotation. We show that some of these CNM structures—perhaps representing intermediate-velocity clouds—are associated with the Local Bubble wall. We compare our results to recent observations and simulations, and we discuss their implications for the multiphase structure of the Milky Way’s interstellar medium.

磁层物质喷射包括狭窄的喷射形式和较宽的扇形形态；喷射由断层互换重联和磁力线稳定性引发；喷射在形成喷喷扩散顶部电流层和横跨流发磁力线后，产生了磁线重联和阿尔文波。伪流带CME与头盔流带CME具有相似的磁学演化，但喷射形态不同。总结：<br />
伪流带CME是与头盔流带CME有所不同的一类喷发。 <div>
Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from pseudostreamers represent a significant fraction of large-scale eruptions from the Sun. In some cases, these CMEs take a narrow jet-like form reminiscent of coronal jets; in others, they have a much broader fan-shaped morphology like CMEs from helmet streamers. We present results from a magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a broad pseudostreamer CME. The early evolution of the eruption is initiated through a combination of breakout interchange reconnection at the overlying null point and ideal instability of the flux rope that forms within the pseudostreamer. This stage is characterized by a rolling motion and deflection of the flux rope toward the breakout current layer. The stretching out of the strapping field forms a flare current sheet below the flux rope; reconnection onset there forms low-lying flare arcade loops and the two-ribbon flare footprint. Once the CME flux rope breaches the rising breakout current layer, interchange reconnection with the external open field disconnects one leg from the Sun. This induces a whip-like rotation of the flux rope, generating the unstructured fan shape characteristic of pseudostreamer CMEs. Interchange reconnection behind the CME releases torsional Alfvén waves and bursty dense outflows into the solar wind. Our results demonstrate that pseudostreamer CMEs follow the same overall magnetic evolution as coronal jets, although they present different morphologies of their ejecta. We conclude that pseudostreamer CMEs should be considered a class of eruptions that are distinct from helmet-streamer CMEs, in agreement with previous observational studies.

The foreshock region filled with turbulences is a natural lab for studying interactions between plasma and waves. The underlying processes are vital for dissipating the energy carried by the solar wind into the Martian environment. In this study, we analyze an ultralow-frequency wave observed on 2015 August 14 by Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution upstream of the Martian bow shock. The wave properties match with those of 30 s waves; the dispersion calculation shows that the upstream plasma was capable of generating the observed waves. The analysis of the ion behaviors implies the wave generated without a field-aligned beam, while the growth rate of waves seems to be modulated by the interplanetary magnetic field conditions. These results indicate the unique role of the Martian foreshock in the interaction between the solar wind and the planet.

We report the first detection of the metal-bearing molecules sodium sulfide and magnesium sulfide and the tentative detection of calcium monoxide in the interstellar medium toward the Galactic center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027. The derived column densities are (5.0 ± 1.1) × 1010 cm−2, (6.0 ± 0.6) × 1010 cm−2, and (2.0 ± 0.5) × 1010 cm−2, respectively. This translates into fractional abundances with respect to H2 of (3.7 ± 1.0) × 10−13, (4.4 ± 0.8) × 10−13, and (1.5 ± 0.4) × 10−13, respectively. We have also searched for other Na-, Mg-, and Ca-bearing species toward this source but none of them have been detected and thus we provide upper limits for their abundances. We discuss the possible chemical routes involved in the formation of these molecules containing metals under interstellar conditions. Finally, we compare the ratio between sulfur-bearing and oxygen-bearing molecules with and without metals, finding that metal-bearing sulfur molecules are much more abundant than metal-bearing oxygen ones, in contrast with the general trend found in the ratios between other nonmetal-oxygen- and sulfur-bearing molecules. This further strengthens the idea that sulfur may be a little depleted in G+0.693-0.027 as a result of the low-velocity shocks present in this source sputtering large amounts of material from dust grains.

With numerical simulations that employ adaptive ray-tracing (ART) for radiative transfer at the same time as evolving gas magnetohydrodynamics, thermodynamics, and photochemistry, it is possible to obtain a high-resolution view of ultraviolet (UV) fields and their effects in realistic models of the multiphase interstellar medium. Here, we analyze results from TIGRESS-NCR simulations, which follow both far-UV (FUV) wavelengths, important for photoelectric heating and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon excitation, and the Lyman continuum (LyC), which photoionizes hydrogen. Considering two models, representing solar neighborhood and inner-galaxy conditions, we characterize the spatial distribution and time variation of UV radiation fields, and quantify their correlations with gas. We compare four approximate models for the FUV to simulated values to evaluate alternatives when full ART is infeasible. By convolving FUV radiation with density, we produce mock maps of dust emission. We introduce a method to calibrate mid-IR observations, for example from JWST, to obtain high-resolution gas surface density maps. We then consider the LyC radiation field, finding most of the gas exposed to this radiation to be in ionization–recombination equilibrium and to have a low neutral fraction. Additionally, we characterize the ionization parameter as a function of the environment. Using a simplified model of the LyC radiation field, we produce synthetic maps of emission measure (EM). We show that the simplified model can be used to extract an estimate of the neutral fraction of the photoionized gas and mean free path of ionizing radiation from observed EM maps in galaxies.

HETDEX计划结合大规模的公众科学活动和机器学习，以加强HETDEX天体望远镜暗能量实验。通过Dark Energy Explorers进行了600万次分类，我们可以确信，当至少有10位个体对源进行分类时，我们能够以超过94%的置信水平确定一个源是否是虚假的；对于信噪比更高的源，这一置信水平会进一步提高。截至目前，我们只能对19万个源应用这种直接分析方法。HETDEX的全样本将包括大约2-3百万个源，包括邻近星系（[O ii]发射体）、远距星系（Lyα发射体或LAEs）、假阳性和仪器问题的污染。通过使用Dark Energy Explorers的经过目视审查的样本，我们可以应对这个10倍增加的样本量。我们已将目视审查过的样本数量从之前的试点研究中的1.4万个LAE候选者增加到19万个。此外，利用目前的目视审查样本，我们为1.2百万个LAEs候选者生成了真假阳性分类。目前，我们拥有来自全球159个国家的约1.7万名志愿者。因此，我们正在将公众科学家或公民科学家的分析应用于我们的完整HETDEX数据集，为大家创造了一个无需先前技术知识的免费教育机会。 <div>
We are merging a large participatory science effort with machine learning to enhance the Hobby–Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX). Our overall goal is to remove false positives, allowing us to use lower signal-to-noise data and sources with low goodness-of-fit. With six million classifications through Dark Energy Explorers, we can confidently determine if a source is not real at over 94% confidence level when classified by at least 10 individuals; this confidence level increases for higher signal-to-noise sources. To date, we have only been able to apply this direct analysis to 190,000 sources. The full sample of HETDEX will contain around 2–3 million sources, including nearby galaxies ([O ii] emitters), distant galaxies (Lyα emitters or LAEs), false positives, and contamination from instrument issues. We can accommodate this tenfold increase by using machine learning with visually vetted samples from Dark Energy Explorers. We have already increased by over tenfold the number of sources that have been visually vetted from our previous pilot study where we only had 14,000 visually vetted LAE candidates. This paper expands on the previous work by increasing the visually vetted sample from 14,000 to 190,000. In addition, using our currently visually vetted sample, we generate a real or false positive classification for the full candidate sample of 1.2 million LAEs. We currently have approximately 17,000 volunteers from 159 countries around the world. Thus, we are applying participatory or citizen scientist analysis to our full HETDEX data set, creating a free educational opportunity that requires no prior technical knowledge.

总结: 本文分析了KIC 8840638的光变化，利用Kepler任务的高精度时间序列数据。分析发现，该目标是一个新的分离式食双星系统，具有一个δ Scuti成分，而不是先前所知的单一δ Scuti恒星。短时序数据的频率分析显示出95个显著频率，其中大多数位于23-32天^ -1的频率范围内。其中，有七个独立频率在δ Scuti恒星的典型频率范围内，并且它们被确定为压力模式。此外，傅里叶变换和自相关函数分析还检测到可能的大分裂值 Δν = 36.5 ± 0.1 μHz。轨道频率forb（= 0.320008 day^ -1）及其谐波也在频率谱中直接检测到。从PHOEBE派生的双星模型表明，该双星系统处于分离的配置中，质量比为，倾角为°。得出的参数和双星演化模型表明，主星是一个接近离开主序的物体，温度约为7600 K，而次星似乎是一个温度比主星低约3100 K的进入巨星分支的冷组件。此外，该系统可能经历了质量比反转，其中质量更大的星是吸积成分，质量较小的星是捐赠星。<br /><br /> <div>
In this paper, we analyze the light variation of KIC 8840638 using high-precision time-series data from the Kepler mission. The analysis reveals that this target is a new detached eclipsing binary system with a δ Scuti component, rather than a single δ Scuti star as previously known. The frequency analysis of short-cadence data reveals 95 significant frequencies, most of which lie in a frequency range of 23−32 day−1. Among them, seven independent frequencies are detected in the typical frequency range of δ Scuti stars, and they are identified as pressure modes. In addition, a possible large separation value of Δν = 36.5 ± 0.1 μHz is also detected with the Fourier transform (FT) and autocorrelation function (AC) analysis. The orbital frequency forb (= 0.320008 day−1) and its harmonics are also detected directly in the frequency spectrum. The binary modelings derived from PHOEBE indicate that this binary system is in detached configurations with a mass ratio of , an inclination angle of °. The derived parameters and binary evolutionary model suggest that the primary star is an object on the verge of leaving the main sequence with a temperature of ∼7600 K, while the secondary appears to be a cool component entering the giant branch with a temperature ∼3100 K lower than the primary. Moreover, this system may have undergone a mass ratio reversal, where the more massive star is the gainer component and the less massive one is the donor star.

总结: <br /><br />本文研究了FU Ori和EX Lup类型的天体对象，在这些天体对象中观察到的化学反应提供了理解恒星和行星形成过程中关键阶段的自然实验。研究表明，这些天体物体的化学特征在恒星暴发后发生了明显的变化，而V1057 Cyg是其中一种典型的化学反应丰富的对象。其他四个天体对象的化学特征受到灵敏度限制，而V1057 Cyg包含了最高的盘/包层气体质量。这为我们深入了解这些恒星暴发对化学成分产生的影响提供了重要线索。 <div>
FU Ori– and EX Lup–type objects present natural experiments for understanding a critical stage in the star and planet formation process. These objects offer insight into the diversity of molecules available to forming planetary systems due to a sudden increase in accretion, and central luminosity causes the disk and surrounding material to increase in temperature. This allows for volatiles to sublimate off of grains and exist in the gas phase for tens to hundreds of years after initial outburst. While this dynamic stage may be common for solar-type protostars, observations of the chemical impact of these bursts are rare. In this article, we present observations from the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array of five young stellar objects (YSOs) that have undergone outbursts within the past 100 yr and catalog the volatile chemistry found within ∼1000 au of the YSO. Only one source clearly shows a line-rich spectra with >11 molecules detected, including complex organics and water, as is expected for a spectra signature for a postoutburst source. This source is V1057 Cyg, and we present it as the northern analog to the well-studied and molecule-rich FU Ori source, V883 Ori. Our conclusions on the chemical inventory of the other four sources in our sample are sensitivity limited, as V1057 Cyg contains the highest disk/envelope gas mass.

磁通绳模型正在发展，以更好地理解日冕物质抛射。传统模型对于这些大尺度结构的整体几何结构可能不够。一种新的扭曲磁通绳模型被开发出来，能够描述磁通绳断面的任意扭曲或磁轴的变形。该模型能够准确重建观测到的 ICME 事件，证明其在事件重建中的实用性。研究展示了磁通绳模型在单独和多点观测下的准确重建能力，并且表明其几何结构与圆柱体或环形近似不符。<br /><br />总结: 研究开发了新的磁通绳模型，能够描述复杂的几何结构，用于重建观测到的日冕物质抛射事件。 <div>
Magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) at the center of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) are often characterized as simplistic cylindrical or toroidal tubes with field lines that twist around the cylinder or torus axis. Recent multipoint observations suggest that the overall geometry of these large-scale structures may be significantly more complex. As such, contemporary modeling approaches are likely insufficient to properly understand the global structure of any ICME. In an attempt to rectify this issue, we have developed a novel flux rope modeling approach that allows for the description of arbitrary distortions of the flux rope cross section or deformation of the magnetic axis. The resulting distorted MFR model is a fully analytic model that can be used to describe a complex geometry and is numerically efficient enough to be used for event reconstructions. To demonstrate the usefulness of our approach, we focus on a specific implementation of our model and apply it to an ICME event that was observed in situ on 2023 April 23 at the L1 point by the Wind spacecraft and also by the STEREO-A spacecraft, which was 10.°2 further east and 0.°9 south in heliographic coordinates. We demonstrate that our model can accurately reconstruct each observation individually and also gives a fair reconstruction of both events simultaneously using a multipoint reconstruction algorithm, which results in a geometry that is inconsistent with a cylindrical or toroidal approximation.

<div> 关键词: 行星形成, 冰盘, 分子浓度, 辐射传递模型, 红外天文学<br />
总结:<br />
本文介绍了一种新的辐射传输建模框架，用于解释HH 48 NE冰盘中观察到的H2O，CO2和CO冰带的组成和混合状态。结果显示冰主要以混合形式存在，其中CO被分别困在H2O和CO2冰中。HH 48 NE冰盘的组成与早期原恒星阶段有明显差异，暗示了盘的形成或演化过程中的热化学再加工。我们推断整个盘中的冰相C/O比率很低，约为0.1，并且还展示了冰的混合和捕获对C/O比率的径向依赖性产生了显著影响。因此，在比较行星组成和可能的形成情景时，考虑到现实的冰盘组成是至关重要的，而幸运的是，这将有可能用JWST对越来越多的冰盘进行观测。 <div>
Planet formation is strongly influenced by the composition and distribution of volatiles within protoplanetary disks. With JWST, it is now possible to obtain direct observational constraints on disk ices, as recently demonstrated by the detection of ice absorption features toward the edge-on HH 48 NE disk as part of the Ice Age Early Release Science program. Here, we introduce a new radiative transfer modeling framework designed to retrieve the composition and mixing status of disk ices using their band profiles, and apply it to interpret the H2O, CO2, and CO ice bands observed toward the HH 48 NE disk. We show that the ices are largely present as mixtures, with strong evidence for CO trapping in both H2O and CO2 ice. The HH 48 NE disk ice composition (pure versus polar versus apolar fractions) is markedly different from earlier protostellar stages, implying thermal and/or chemical reprocessing during the formation or evolution of the disk. We infer low ice-phase C/O ratios around 0.1 throughout the disk, and also demonstrate that the mixing and entrapment of disk ices can dramatically affect the radial dependence of the C/O ratio. It is therefore imperative that realistic disk ice compositions are considered when comparing planetary compositions with potential formation scenarios, which will fortunately be possible for an increasing number of disks with JWST.

<div> 关键词: AstroSat, X射线双星, 2017年爆发, 类C准周期振荡, 宽带谱分析
总结: 本文利用AstroSat观测了低质量黑洞X射线双星H 1743–322在2017年爆发期间的全面定时和宽带谱分析。我们在同时进行的AstroSat和Swift/XRT观测中检测到约0.4赫兹的C型准周期振荡（QPO），而AstroSat数据中仅在约0.9赫兹处观察到上调谐波。在2017和2018年两次失败的爆发中探测到软时滞，表明软时滞可能与反射特征相关。宽带谱分析表明，源在AstroSat观测期间处于低/硬态。模拟得出，当源的光度约为Eddington光度的1.6%时，存在一个受内部稳定圆轨道截断的明显截断的粘附盘。 <br /><br /> Overall, 本文使用AstroSat对H 1743–322进行了全面定时和宽带谱分析，探测到2017年爆发的失败特征，检测到C型QPO，并观察到软时滞。同时，根据宽带谱分析结果，对源的状态进行了有效的建模。 <div>
We perform a comprehensive timing and broadband spectral analysis using an AstroSat observation of the low-mass black hole X-ray binary H 1743–322 during its 2017 outburst. Additionally, we use two Swift/XRT observations, one of which is simultaneous with AstroSat and the other taken three days earlier, for timing analysis. The hardness–intensity diagram indicates that the 2017 outburst was a failed one, unlike the previous successful outburst in 2016. We detect type C quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the simultaneous AstroSat and Swift/XRT observations at ∼0.4 Hz, whereas an upper harmonic is noticed at ∼0.9 Hz in the AstroSat data only. Although these features are found to be energy-independent, we notice a shift of ∼0.08 Hz in the QPO frequency over the interval of three days. We also investigate the nature of variability in the two consecutive failed outbursts in 2017 and 2018. We detect soft time lags of 23.2 ± 12.2 ms and 140 ± 80 ms at the type C QPO frequencies in 2017 AstroSat and 2018 XMM-Newton data, respectively. The lag–energy spectra from both the outbursts suggest that the soft lags may be associated with reflection features. The broadband spectral analysis indicates that the source was in the low/hard state during the AstroSat observation. Modeling of the disk and reflection continuum suggests the presence of an accretion disk that is significantly truncated by at least 27.4rg from the innermost stable circular orbit when the source luminosity is ∼1.6% of the Eddington luminosity.

<div> 高红移类星体，周期振荡， Fermi Large Area Telescope， QPOs， 二元黑洞<br />
总结:<br />
本研究针对高红移FSRQs的两个类星体进行了研究，发现它们的光变曲线呈现出周期性的高低态变化，表现出QPOs的可能性。通过数据积分和适用于稀疏采样数据的方法对曲线进行分析，估算出两个类星体分别可能存在4.69年和6.82年的QPOs。此外，还分析了类星体的流量概率密度函数以及流量和光谱指数的相关性，考虑了二元黑洞情景作为周期性的可能解释，并估算了潜在的系统参数，结果与中心黑洞质量的独立测量一致。 <div>
While there has been an increase in interest in the possibility of quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) in blazars, the search has hitherto been restricted to sources with well-sampled light curves. Objects with light curves that include gaps have been, to our knowledge, overlooked. Here, we study two such curves, which have the interesting feature of pertaining to relatively high-redshift blazars—FSRQs, PKS 2155-83, and PKS 2255-282—observed by the Fermi Large Area Telescope. Their redshifts border the “cosmic noon” era of galaxy formation and merging, and their light curves exhibit a distinctive pattern of repetitive high and low (gap dominant) states for 15.6 yr. To accommodate for the gaps in the curves, data are integrated over extended time intervals of 1 month and 2 months. The resulting curves were also examined using methods suitable for sparsely sampled data. This investigation of PKS 2155-83 and PKS 2255-282 suggests QPOs with periods of 4.69 ± 0.79 yr (3σ) and 6.82 ± 2.25 yr (2.8σ), respectively. The probability density functions of the blazars’ fluxes, along with the correlation between their flux and spectral index, were also analyzed. Given the epochs in which the objects are observed, the plausibility of a binary black hole scenario as an origin of the apparent periodicity was examined. We estimated the prospective parameters of such a system using a simple geometric model. The total masses were estimated and found to be consistent, in principle, with independent (dynamical) measurements of the central black hole masses in the two host galaxies.

<br />
总结: 本研究使用双星人口综合模型创建了银河系中现实的黑洞-光亮伴星双星系统的人口统计。研究发现，通过测量光度变化，Gaia和TESS任务预计能够分辨约300-1000个（SNR ≥ 10）黑洞-伴星双星系统，而TESS任务预计能够分辨约50-200个。此外，Gaia的径向速度测量也能够帮助解析大约60-70个（SNR ≥ 10）的黑洞-伴星双星系统。这些结果对于揭示黑洞及其前体之间的联系具有重要意义。 <div>
Understanding the connection between the properties of black holes (BHs) and their progenitors is interesting in many branches of astrophysics. Discovering BHs in detached orbits with luminous companions (LCs) promises to help establish this connection since the LC and BH progenitor are expected to have the same metallicity and formation time. We explore the possibility of detecting BH–LC binaries in detached orbits using photometric variations of the LC flux, induced by tidal ellipsoidal variation, relativistic beaming, and self-lensing. We create realistic present-day populations of detached BH–LC binaries in the Milky Way (MW) using binary population synthesis where we adopt observationally motivated initial stellar and binary properties, star formation history, and the present-day distribution of these sources in the MW based on detailed cosmological simulations. We test detectability of these sources via photometric variability by Gaia and TESS missions by incorporating their respective detailed detection biases as well as interstellar extinction. We find that Gaia is expected to resolve ∼300–1000 (∼700–1500) detached BH–LC binaries with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ≥ 10 (1) depending on the photometric precision and details of supernova physics. Similarly, the number of resolved BH–LC binaries with TESS is ∼50–200 (∼140–350). We find that BH–LC binaries would be common between Gaia and TESS. Moreover, ∼60–70 (∼50–200) BH–LC binaries identifiable using photometry with SNR ≥ 10 may also be resolved using Gaia’s radial velocity (astrometry).

<title>JWST/NIRSpec Observations of Brown Dwarfs in the Orion Nebula Cluster</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have used the multiobject mode of the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to obtain low-resolution 1–5 μm spectra of 22 brown dwarf candidates in the Orion Nebula Cluster, which were selected with archival images from the Hubble Space Telescope. One of the targets was previously classified as a Herbig–Haro (HH) object and exhibits strong emission in H i, H2, and the fundamental band of CO, further demonstrating that HH objects can have bright emission in that CO band. The remaining targets have late spectral types (M6.5 to early L) and are young based on gravity-sensitive features, as expected for low-mass members of the cluster. According to theoretical evolutionary models, these objects should have masses that range from the hydrogen burning limit to 0.003–0.007 M⊙. Two of the NIRSpec targets were identified as proplyds in earlier analysis of Hubble images. They have spectral types of M6.5 and M7.5, making them two of the coolest and least massive known proplyds. Another brown dwarf shows absorption bands at 3–5 μm from ices containing H2O, CO2, OCN−, and CO, indicating that it is either an edge-on class II system or a class I protostar. It is the coolest and least massive object that has detections of these ice features. In addition, it appears to be the first candidate for a protostellar brown dwarf that has spectroscopy confirming its late spectral type.

<title>Photonuclear Reaction Rates of 157,159Ho and 163,165Tm and Their Impact in the γ-process</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Reliable photonuclear reaction rates in stellar conditions are essential for understanding the origin of the heavy stable neutron-deficient isotopes between 74Se and 196Hg, i.e., p-nuclei. However, many reaction rates of relevance still have to rely on the Hauser–Feshbach (HF) model due to the rarity of experimental progress. One such case is in the mass range of 160 for Dy, Er, Ho, and Tm isotopes. In this work we attempt to constrain the HF model in the TALYS package by reproducing the available experimental data on 160Dy(p, γ)161Ho and 162Er(p, γ)163Tm in the A ∼ 160 mass region, and examine the effects of level density, gamma strength function, and the optical model potential. The constrained model then allows us to calculate the reaction rates of 157,159Ho(γ, p) and 163,165Tm(γ, p) for the γ-process nucleosynthesis in a carbon-deflagration model for Type Ia supernovae. Our recommended rates differ from the JINA REACLIB by more than one order of magnitude in the temperature range 2–3 GK. This results in changes in the final abundance of p-nuclei in the A ∼ 160 mass range by −5.5% to 3% from those with JINA, which means that the uncertainty of (γ, p) reactions is not predominant for the synthesis of these nuclei.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The characteristic timescale at which the variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) turns from red noise to white noise can probe the accretion physics around supermassive black holes (SMBHs). A number of works have studied the characteristic timescale of quasars and obtained quite different scaling relations between the timescale and quasar physical properties. One possible reason for the discrepancies is that the characteristic timescale can be easily underestimated if the light curves are not long enough. In this work, we construct well-defined AGN samples to observationally test the relationships between the characteristic timescale and AGN properties obtained by previous works. Our samples eliminate the effects of insufficient light-curve lengths. We confirm that the timescale predictions of the Corona Heated Accretion disk Reprocessing model are consistent with our timescale measurements. The timescale predictions by empirical relations are systematically smaller than our measured ones. Our results provide further evidence that AGN variability is driven by thermal fluctuations in SMBH accretion disks. Future flagship time-domain surveys can critically test our conclusions and reveal the physical nature of AGN variability.

<title>Exploring the Dynamic Rotational Profile of the Hotter Solar Atmosphere: A Multiwavelength Approach Using SDO/AIA Data</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Understanding the global rotational profile of the solar atmosphere and its variation is fundamental to uncovering a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of the solar magnetic field and the extent of coupling between different layers of the Sun. In this study, we employ the method of image correlation to analyze the extensive data set provided by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly of the Solar Dynamic Observatory in different wavelength channels. We find a significant increase in the equatorial rotational rate (A) and a decrease in absolute latitudinal gradient (∣B∣) at all temperatures representative of the solar atmosphere, implying an equatorial rotation up to 4.18% and 1.92% faster and less differential when compared to the rotation rates for the underlying photosphere derived from Doppler measurement and sunspots respectively. In addition, we also find a significant increase in equatorial rotation rate (A) and a decrease in differential nature (∣B∣ decreases) at different layers of the solar atmosphere. We also explore a possible connection from the solar interior to the atmosphere and interestingly found that A at r = 0.94 R⊙ and 0.965 R⊙ show an excellent match with 171 Å, 304 Å, and 1600 Å, respectively. Furthermore, we observe a positive correlation between the rotational parameters measured from 1600 Å, 131 Å, 193 Å, and 211 Å with the yearly averaged sunspot number, suggesting a potential dependence of the solar rotation on the appearance of magnetic structures related to the solar cycle or the presence of cycle dependence of solar rotation in the solar atmosphere.

<title>Multifluid Theory of Electrostatic Ion Cyclotron Waves in Partially Ionized Plasmas</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Partially ionized plasmas universally exist in various astrophysical environments, such as the solar atmosphere and the E region of the ionosphere. In these contexts, the existence and propagation of waves in plasmas could be significantly influenced by effects of weakly ionized plasma (e.g., ion–neutral collisions). In this work, we investigate electrostatic ion cyclotron (EIC) waves in partially ionized plasmas based on the multifluid model with adiabatic electrons. Two distinct branches of EIC waves coexist in partially ionized plasmas: one branch is the conventional EIC waves; the other branch propagates around the “effective ion cyclotron frequency” which originates from self-consistent ion–neutral collisions. Furthermore, theoretical predictions in the new branch of EIC waves are qualitatively consistent with laboratory observations. In addition, a comparison between our theory and the previous work is also performed. This work can aid in understanding the acceleration and transverse heating of ions in partially ionized astrophysical plasmas where the ion–neutral collisions are frequent.

<title>Characteristics and Source Regions of Slow Alfvénic Solar Wind Observed by Parker Solar Probe</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using a classification scheme for solar-wind type based on the heliocentric distance of the observation, we look at near-perihelion observations from Parker Solar Probe Encounters 4 to 14 to study the sources of the slow Alfvénic solar wind (SASW). Through Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) modeling and ballistic mapping, we connect streams to their solar source and find that a primary population of SASW comes from low magnetic field strength regions (low-B0), likely small coronal holes (CHs) and their overexpanded boundaries, while a second population of high field strength (high-B0) seems to emerge from non-CH structures potentially through interchange reconnection with nearby open field lines. This low-B0 SASW shows larger expansion than the fast solar wind (FSW) but similar mass flux, potentially indicating additional heating below the critical point, and emergence from a cooler structure, which could lead to slower wind emerging from CH-like structures. We show that this low-B0 SASW shows stronger preferential acceleration of alpha particles (similar to the FSW) than the high-B0 SASW, and that this is a velocity-dependent phenomenon as found in previous studies. To have additional confidence in our mapping results, we quantify the error on both the PFSS model and ballistic mapping and discuss how additional multipoint observations of plasma parameters and composition would allow us to better constrain our models and connect the solar wind to its source.

Magnetic holes (MHs) are transient magnetic structures responsible for energy conversion in space plasma. Using single-spacecraft measurements from Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN), the existence of MHs on Mars has been confirmed. However, due to the limitations of single-spacecraft observations, significant uncertainty also arises on the identification of the spatial scale and 3D geometry of MHs. In this study, we report a series of MHs successively detected by Tianwen-1 near the high-latitude magnetopause and by the MAVEN spacecraft near the subsolar magnetopause. The large separation between Tianwen-1 and MAVEN (∼4 RM) suggests these MHs are macroscale structures extending along the axial direction. Additionally, we observe whistler waves generated by electron perpendicular anisotropy in one of the macroscale MHs. This study is the first joint observation of Martian MHs, shedding light on the research of transient magnetic structures on Mars.

ZrO is a well-studied metal monoxide because of its astrophysical importance in characterizing S stars. The bands of the d3Φ–a3Δ system (γ system) with and v″ ≤ 5 are rotationally analyzed using the PGOPHER program to provide spectroscopic constants. The high-resolution ZrO emission spectrum was recorded with a Fourier transform spectrometer using a high-temperature carbon furnace source. New ab initio calculations of the transition dipole moment were carried out in order to determine the vibronic band strengths. The spectroscopic constants, along with the band strengths, are used to calculate a line list for the γ system. This line list can be used to determine Zr abundances in S stars. We also correct the line strengths for the B1Π–A1Δ transition calculated in our previous work.

<title>Heavy Ion Escape at Mars during the Disappearing Solar Wind Event in 2022 December</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A unique event known as the disappearing solar wind (DSW), characterized by an extremely low-density solar wind stream, occurred at Mars on 2022 December 26–27. As this stream flowed past Mars, several properties of the Mars–solar wind interaction changed in response to the density drop. We utilize in situ plasma measurements from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN spacecraft to examine heavy ion escape during this event. We find that escaping ions with energies above and below 30 eV responded differently to the reduction in solar wind density. High-energy ions experienced a decrease in flux, whereas low-energy ions experienced an increase, regardless of whether they were escaping through the plume or tailward channel. Furthermore, we observe a net reduction in the flux of plume escaping ions during the DSW period, primarily due to a considerable reduction in the high-energy component, which typically dominates plume escape. In contrast, the overall flux of tailward escaping ions increased during this period. These variations in heavy ion escape are mainly attributed to substantial reductions in solar wind dynamic pressure and momentum density. This paper provides new insights into the dynamics of heavy ion escape under an exceptional state of the Mars–solar wind interaction.

总结: 本研究利用Keck Planet Finder的极其精密的多普勒速度观测和NASA的Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite的高频光度测量，在邻近的K矮星σ Draconis上检测到了太阳类振荡现象。这颗恒星是迄今为止观测到的最冷的矮星，具有太阳类振荡的光度和速度观测值。观测结果与已建立的振荡光度-速度幅度关系非常吻合，并进一步证明了Teff < 5500 K的恒星的模式振幅遵循(L/M)1.5关系。通过对光度数据建模，测量出该恒星的天体测量年龄为4.5亿年。这些观测结果表明，下一代光谱仪和精密的空间光度测量技术能够将观测星际地壳运动学扩展到邻近的冷矮星，这对于恒星天体物理学具有重要意义，并且对未来的空间望远镜直接成像行星是极其重要的目标。 <br /><br /> <div>
Asteroseismology of dwarf stars cooler than the Sun is very challenging owing to the low amplitudes and rapid timescales of oscillations. Here we present the asteroseismic detection of solar-like oscillations at 4-minute timescales ( μHz) in the nearby K dwarf σ Draconis using extreme-precision Doppler velocity observations from the Keck Planet Finder and 20 s cadence photometry from NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. The star is the coolest dwarf star to date with both velocity and luminosity observations of solar-like oscillations, having amplitudes of 5.9 ± 0.8 cm s−1 and 0.8 ± 0.2 ppm, respectively. These measured values are in excellent agreement with established luminosity−velocity amplitude relations for oscillations and provide further evidence that mode amplitudes for stars with Teff < 5500 K diminish in scale following an (L/M)1.5 relation. By modeling the star’s oscillation frequencies from photometric data, we measure an asteroseismic age of 4.5 ± 0.9 (ran) ± 1.2 (sys) Gyr. The observations demonstrate the capability of next-generation spectrographs and precise space-based photometry to extend observational asteroseismology to nearby cool dwarfs, which are benchmarks for stellar astrophysics and prime targets for directly imaging planets using future space-based telescopes.

<div> 关键词: 辐射, 圆形双星系统, 圆环盘, 温度分布, 能谱

总结:<br /><br />这篇论文研究了围绕恒星到中等质量黑洞的环绕盘(CBD)受到两个黑洞周围的两个小盘辐射（即辐射），对其光谱的影响。研究假设CBD是一个标准的盘，并采用轨道平均辐射通量来计算CBD的温度分布和相应的盘能谱。研究发现，CBD的光谱几乎不受双星质量比的影响。此外，研究还发现两个小盘和CBD的联合光谱具有双峰特性，一个在软X射线波段，另一个在红外波段。观测到的流量密度向软X射线峰增加，而远离红外峰的频率减小。后者的特征可以通过用Subaru和JWST进行近红外观测进行验证。 <div>
We study the effect of irradiation from two accretion disks (minidisks) around respective black holes of stellar-to-intermediate masses in a circular binary on the spectrum of a circumbinary disk (CBD) surrounding them. We assume the CBD to be a standard disk and adopt the orbit-averaged irradiation flux because the viscous timescale is much longer than the orbital period. We then solve the energy equation both analytically and numerically to compute the CBD temperature distribution and the corresponding disk spectrum. We find that the analytically calculated spectra are in good agreement with the numerical ones. The CBD spectrum is almost independent of the binary mass ratio. We also find that the combined spectra of two minidisks and the CBD have double peaks, one peak in the soft X-ray band and the other in the infrared (IR) band. The former peak comes from the two minidisks, while the latter peak from the CBD. The observed flux density increases with frequency as ν1/3 toward the soft X-ray peak, while it decreases with frequency away from the IR peak as ν−5/3. The latter feature is testable with near-IR observations with Subaru and JWST.

<div> AGNs, black hole accretion, SED evolution, disk-corona connection, X-ray variability
<br /><br />总结: 通过对1ES 1927+654的研究发现，其光谱能量分布的演化经历了四个不同阶段，表现出超过Eddington极限的黑洞吸积率。此外，还观察到紫外线亮度和光学到X射线斜率（αOX）之间的相关性，以及光学玻尔克分子校正因子（κ5100）的双分支特性。此外，还发现了盘-冠连接的强有力证据，以及X射线辐射在辐射-温度图中显示出的系统性变化。研究还发现，出现在650天后，出现了从厚盘向薄盘的过渡现象。 <div>
Time-domain studies of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) offer a powerful tool for understanding black hole accretion physics. Prior to the optical outburst on 2017 December 23, 1ES 1927+654 was classified as a “true” type 2 AGN, an unobscured source intrinsically devoid of broad-line emission in polarized spectra. Through our 3 yr monitoring campaign spanning X-ray to ultraviolet/optical wavelengths, we analyze the post-outburst evolution of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of 1ES 1927+654. Examination of the intrinsic SED and subsequent modeling using different models reveal that the post-outburst spectrum is best described by a combination of a disk, blackbody, and corona components. We detect systematic SED variability and identify four distinct stages in the evolution of these components. During the event the accretion rate is typically above the Eddington limit. The correlation between ultraviolet luminosity and optical to X-ray slope (αOX) resembles that seen in previous studies of type 1 AGNs, yet exhibits two distinct branches with opposite slopes. The optical bolometric correction factor (κ5100) is ∼10 times higher than typical AGNs, again displaying two distinct branches. Correlations among the corona optical depth, disk surface density, and αOX provide compelling evidence of a disk–corona connection. The X-ray corona showcases systematic variation in the compactness-temperature plot. Between 200 and 650 days, the corona is “hotter when brighter,” whereas after 650 days, it becomes “cooler when brighter.” This bimodal behavior, in conjunction with the bifurcated branches of αOX and κ5100, offers strong evidence of a transition from a slim disk to a thin disk ∼650 days after the outburst.

<br />
本研究分析了917对Gaia天体测量双星，发现主星的自转速度在面对面轨道上明显较慢，表明存在显著的自转轨道对齐。这些双星的主星自转速度较慢，属于早期恒星双峰自转速度分布中的慢旋转群体。质量比小于0.3的双星主星自转速度更小，与模型预测一致。然而，具有大离心率（大于0.4）的双星并不显示自转轨道对齐或自转速度减小。通过蒙特卡洛技术，测量了自转轨道对齐率为75% ± 5% ，平均自转减小因子为〈Salign〉= 0.43 ± 0.04。因此，我们得出结论，75%的A型近密双星可能经历了周围双星盘吸积，并可能通过盘片碎裂和内向盘片迁移的方式形成。剩下的25%，主要是那些具有大离心率的双星，可能通过核心碎裂和动力摩擦引起的轨道衰减形成。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究分析了大量双星系统，发现了主星自转速度与轨道对齐的关系，以及这种现象对双星形成和演化的重要性。结果表明，大部分A型近密双星可能通过盘片碎裂和内向盘片迁移形成，而一小部分通过核心碎裂和动力摩擦引起的轨道衰减形成。 <div>
The spin–orbit alignment of binary stars traces their formation and accretion history. Previous studies of spin–orbit alignment have been limited to small samples, slowly rotating solar-type stars, and/or wide visual binaries that not surprisingly manifest random spin–orbit orientations. We analyze 917 Gaia astrometric binaries across periods P = 100–3000 days (a = 0.5–5 au) that have B8-F1 IV/V primaries (M1 = 1.5–3 M⊙) and measured projected rotational velocities v sin i. The primary stars in face-on orbits exhibit substantially smaller v sin i compared to those in edge-on orbits at the 6σ level, demonstrating significant spin–orbit alignment. The primaries in our astrometric binaries are rotating more slowly than their single-star or wide-binary counterparts and therefore comprise the slow-rotator population in the observed bimodal rotational velocity distribution of early-type stars. We discuss formation models of close binaries where some of the disk angular momentum is transferred to the orbit and/or secondary spin, quenching angular momentum flow to the primary spin. The primaries in astrometric binaries with small mass ratios q = M2/M1 < 0.3 possess even smaller v sin i, consistent with model predictions. Meanwhile, astrometric binaries with large eccentricities e > 0.4 do not display spin–orbit alignment or spin reduction. Using a Monte Carlo technique, we measure a spin–orbit alignment fraction of Falign = 75% ± 5% and an average spin reduction factor of 〈Salign〉 = 0.43 ± 0.04. We conclude that 75% of close A-type binaries likely experienced circumbinary disk accretion and probably formed via disk fragmentation and inward disk migration. The remaining 25%, mostly those with e > 0.4, likely formed via core fragmentation and orbital decay via dynamical friction.

We present the substellar mass function of star-forming clusters (≃0.1 Myr old) in a low-metallicity environment (≃−0.7 dex). We performed deep JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging of two star-forming clusters in Digel Cloud 2, a star-forming region in the outer Galaxy (RG ≳ 15 kpc). The very high sensitivity and spatial resolution of JWST enable us to resolve cluster members clearly down to a mass detection limit of 0.02 M⊙, enabling the first detection of brown dwarfs in low-metallicity clusters. A total of 52 and 91 sources were extracted in mass-AV-limited samples in the two clusters, from which initial mass functions (IMFs) were derived by model-fitting the F200W band luminosity function, resulting in IMF peak masses (hereafter MC) for both clusters. Although the uncertainties are rather large, the obtained MC values are lower than those in any previous study ( ). Comparison with the local open clusters with similar ages to the target clusters (∼106–107 yr) suggests a metallicity dependence of MC, with lower MC at lower metallicities, while the comparison with globular clusters, with similarly low metallicities but considerably older (∼1010 yr), suggests that the target clusters have not yet experienced significant dynamical evolution and remain in their initial physical condition. The lower MC is also consistent with the theoretical expectation of the lower Jeans mass owing to the higher gas density under such low metallicity. The MC values derived from observations in such an environment would place significant constraints on the understanding of star formation.

总结:
本文讨论了在宇宙星系形成模拟中实施的传统星际介质子网格模型，并介绍了新的第一原理模型的优势。作者将TIGRESS数值框架的校准与PRFM理论相结合，比较了TNG50模拟的本机输出和PRFM的后处理预测。研究发现，PRFM模型预测高密度和红移时的气体耗尽时间比SH03模型短。这些结果代表了在宇宙星系形成模拟中实施新的、经过数值校准的子网格算法的第一步。<br /><br /> <div>
Traditional star formation subgrid models implemented in cosmological galaxy formation simulations, such as that of V. Springel & L. Hernquist (hereafter SH03), employ adjustable parameters to satisfy constraints measured in the local Universe. In recent years, however, theory and spatially resolved simulations of the turbulent, multiphase, star-forming interstellar medium (ISM) have begun to produce new first-principles models, which when fully developed can replace traditional subgrid prescriptions. This approach has advantages of being physically motivated and predictive rather than empirically tuned, and allowing for varying environmental conditions rather than being tied to local-Universe conditions. As a prototype of this new approach, by combining calibrations from the TIGRESS numerical framework with the pressure-regulated feedback-modulated (PRFM) theory, simple formulae can be obtained for both the gas depletion time and an effective equation of state. Considering galaxies in TNG50, we compare the “native” simulation outputs with postprocessed predictions from PRFM. At TNG50 resolution, the total midplane pressure is nearly equal to the total ISM weight, indicating that galaxies in TNG50 are close to satisfying vertical equilibrium. The measured gas scale height is also close to theoretical equilibrium predictions. The slopes of the effective equations of states are similar, but with effective velocity dispersion normalization from SH03 slightly larger than that from current TIGRESS simulations. Because of this and the decrease in PRFM feedback yield at high pressure, the PRFM model predicts shorter gas depletion times than the SH03 model at high densities and redshift. Our results represent a first step toward implementing new, numerically calibrated subgrid algorithms in cosmological galaxy formation simulations.

The CO(1–0) line has been carefully calibrated as a tracer of molecular gas mass. However, recent studies often favor higher J transitions of the CO molecule, which are brighter and accessible for redshift ranges where CO(1–0) is not. These lines are not perfect analogs for CO(1–0), owing to their more stringent excitation conditions, and must be calibrated for use as molecular gas tracers. Here, we introduce the Arizona Molecular ISM Survey with the SMT, a multi-CO line survey of z ∼ 0 galaxies conducted to calibrate the CO(2–1) and CO(3–2) lines. The final survey includes CO(2–1) spectra of 176 galaxies and CO(3–2) spectra for a subset of 45. We supplement these with archival CO(1–0) spectra from xCOLD GASS for all sources and additional CO(1–0) observations with the Kitt Peak 12 m Telescope. Targets were selected to be representative of the 109M⊙ ≤ M* ≤ 1011.5M⊙ galaxy population. Our project emphasized careful characterization of statistical and systematic uncertainties to enable studies of trends in CO line ratios. We show that optical and CO disk sizes are on average equal, for both the CO(1–0) and CO(2–1) line. We measure the distribution of CO line luminosity ratios, finding medians (16th–84th percentile) of 0.71 (0.51–0.96) for the CO(2–1)-to-CO(1–0) ratio, 0.39 (0.24–0.53) for the CO(3–2)-to-CO(1–0) ratio, and 0.53 (0.41–0.74) for the CO(3–2)-to-CO(2–1) ratio. A companion paper presents our study of CO(2–1)'s applicability as a molecular gas mass tracer and search for trends in the CO(2–1)-to-CO(1–0) ratio. Our catalog of CO line luminosities is publicly available.

The degree of spin–orbit alignment in a population of binary stars can be determined from measurements of their orbital inclinations and rotational broadening of their spectral lines. Alignment in a face-on binary guarantees low rotational broadening, while alignment in an edge-on binary maximizes the rotational broadening. In contrast, if spin–orbit angles (ψ) are random, rotational broadening should not depend on orbital inclination. Using this technique, we investigated a sample of 2727 astrometric binaries from Gaia DR3 with F-type primaries and orbital periods between 50 and 1000 days (separations 0.3–2.7 au). We found that ψ is strongly associated with e, the orbital eccentricity. When e < 0.15, the mean spin–orbit angle is degrees, while for e > 0.7, it rises to degrees. These results suggest that some binaries are affected by processes during their formation or evolution that excite both orbital eccentricity and inclination.

新的快速滚动（FR）机制在广义非标准自然膨胀中引入了原始黑洞（PBH）和引力波（GW）的产生。该模型中，通过选择合适的非标准质量尺度参数M(ϕ)的函数，可以产生场演化路径中的悬崖状区域。当通胀场沿着陡峭的悬崖滚动时，其在FR阶段的动能会比缓慢滚动阶段增加。因此，PBH产生的种子就在这个瞬态的FR阶段诞生了。根据悬崖的位置，可以形成适合解释总黑暗物质、微引力透镜效应、LIGO-Virgo事件和NANOGrav 15年数据的PBH的适当案例。该模型的其中一个案例的引力波密度谱落在NANOGrav 15年的范围内，并呈现出Ω_gw ∝ f^3.42的行为，符合NANOGrav 15年的约束。此外，根据再热考虑，证明PBH是在辐射主导时代诞生的。此外，还说明了该模型在理论滩地标准和宇宙微波背景尺度的观测约束方面的可行性。<br /><br />总结: 本论文介绍了一种新的快速滚动机制，用于在广义非标准自然膨胀中产生原始黑洞和引力波。该模型具有解释多种宇宙现象的潜力，并且在理论和观测方面都得到了验证。 <div>
In this work, a new fast-roll (FR) mechanism to generate primordial black holes (PBHs) and gravitational waves (GWs) in generalized noncanonical natural inflation is introduced. In this model, choosing a suitable function for noncanonical mass scale parameter M(ϕ) gives rise to produce a cliff-like region in the field evolution path. When inflaton rolls down the steep cliff, its kinetic energy during an FR stage increases in comparison with a slow-roll stage. Hence, seeds of PBH production are born in this transient FR stage. Depending on the position of the cliff, appropriate cases of PBHs for explaining total dark matter, microlensing effects, LIGO–Virgo events, and NANOGrav 15 yr data can be formed. The density spectrum of GWs related to one case of the model lies in the NANOGrav 15 yr domain and behaves like . The spectral index γ = 3.42 for this case satisfies the NANOGrav 15 yr constraint. Moreover, regarding reheating considerations, it is demonstrated that PBHs are born in the radiation-dominated era. Furthermore, viability of the model in light of theoretical swampland criteria and observational constraints on cosmic microwave background scales are illustrated.

<div> 关键词: sub-Neptunes, water condensation, atmospheric compositions, James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), spectroscopic observations

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了水冷凝对亚海王星大气成分的影响，特别关注了詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜（JWST）光谱观测的影响。研究表明，水冷凝可以显著影响大气成分，尤其是稀薄氢气包围层的行星。这种影响主要表现为大气中氧耗竭，造成碳/氧比例增加。这种变化特别影响氢气丰富的行星，导致主要氮和碳的载体从N2和富氧物种如CO/CO2转向更重的碳氢化合物和腈。JWST对LHS 1140 b的观测谱可能与这种情况一致，表明表面浅层存在大量水冷凝或高大气C/O比。相反，JWST对K2-18 b的观测与具有厚大气层的富挥发性迷你海王星更为一致。 <div>
Understanding the surface temperature and interior structure of cold-to-temperate sub-Neptunes is critical for assessing their habitability, yet direct observations are challenging. In this study, we investigate the impact of water condensation on the atmospheric compositions of sub-Neptunes, focusing on the implications for James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) spectroscopic observations. By modeling the atmospheric photochemistry of two canonical sub-Neptunes, K2-18 b and LHS 1140 b, both with and without water condensation and with and without thick atmospheres, we demonstrate that water condensation can significantly affect the predicted atmospheric compositions. This effect is driven by oxygen depletion from the condensation of water vapor and primarily manifests as an increase in the C/O ratio within the photochemically active regions of the atmosphere. This change in composition particularly affects planets with thin H2-dominated atmospheres, leading to a transition in dominant nitrogen and carbon carriers from N2 and oxygen-rich species like CO/CO2 toward heavier hydrocarbons and nitriles. While our models do not fully account for the loss mechanisms of these higher-order species, such molecules can go on to form more refractory molecules or hazes. Planets with thin H2-rich atmospheres undergoing significant water condensation are thus likely to exhibit very hazy atmospheres. The relatively flat JWST spectra observed for LHS 1140 b could be consistent with such a scenario, suggesting a shallow surface with extensive water condensation or a high atmospheric C/O ratio. Conversely, the JWST observations of K2-18 b are better aligned with a volatile-rich mini-Neptune with a thick atmosphere.

We present a detailed investigation of photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric observations of the Type II SN 2023ixf. Earlier studies have provided compelling evidence for a delayed shock breakout from a confined dense circumstellar matter (CSM) enveloping the progenitor star. The temporal evolution of polarization in the SN 2023ixf phase revealed three distinct peaks in polarization evolution at 1.4 days, 6.4 days, and 79.2 days, indicating an asymmetric dense CSM, an aspherical shock front and clumpiness in the low-density extended CSM, and an aspherical inner ejecta/He-core. SN 2023ixf displayed two dominant axes, one along the CSM-outer ejecta and the other along the inner ejecta/He-core, showcasing the independent origin of asymmetry in the early and late evolution. The argument for an aspherical shock front is further strengthened by the presence of a high-velocity broad absorption feature in the blue wing of the Balmer features in addition to the P-Cygni absorption post-16 days. Hydrodynamical light-curve modeling indicated a progenitor mass of 10 M⊙ with a radius of 470 R⊙ and explosion energy of 2 × 1051 erg, along with 0.06 M⊙ of 56 Ni, though these properties are not unique due to modeling degeneracies. The modeling also indicated a two-zone CSM: a confined dense CSM extending up to 5 × 1014 cm with a mass-loss rate of 10−2M⊙ yr−1 and an extended CSM spanning from 5 × 1014 to at least 1016 cm with a mass-loss rate of 10−4M⊙ yr−1, both assuming a wind-velocity of 10 km s−1. The early-nebular phase observations display an axisymmetric line profile of [O i], redward attenuation of the emission of Hα post 125 days, and flattening in the Ks-band, marking the onset of dust formation.

<div> 二元黑洞并购、高质量恒星、Roche波动溢出、模拟和观测、质量和角动量通量

总结: 本研究探讨了高质量恒星从Roche波动溢出到二元黑洞系统的形成渠道。通过模拟和演化二元质量流，并将新的方法应用于半脱离高质量X射线双星M33 X-7，比较了不同溢出状态下的情况。结果表明极端溢出情况下是保守的，而稍微溢出的情况下是非保守的稳定质量传输，这表明现有假设可能误解了半脱离二元系统作为二元黑洞和共同包络前体的角色和分布。 <div>
While binary merger events have been an active area of study in both simulations and observational work, the formation channels by which a high-mass star extends from Roche lobe overflow (RLO) in a decaying orbit of a black-hole (BH) companion to a binary black-hole (BBH) system merits further investigation. Variable length-scales must be employed to accurately represent the dynamical fluid transfer and morphological development of the primary star as it conforms to a diminishing Roche lobe under the runaway influence of the proximal BH. We have simulated and evolved binary mass flow under these conditions to better identify the key transitional processes from RLO to BBHs. We demonstrate a new methodology to model RLO systems to unprecedented resolution simultaneously across the envelope, donor wind, tidal stream, and accretion disk regimes without reliance upon previously universal symmetry, mass flux, and angular momentum flux assumptions. We have applied this method to the semidetached high-mass X-ray binary M33 X-7 in order to provide a direct comparison to recent observations of an RLO candidate system at two overflow states of overfilling factors f = 1.01 and f = 1.1. We found extreme overflow (f = 1.1) to be entirely conservative in both mass and angular momentum transport, forming a conical L1 tidal stream of density and deflected angle comparable to existing predictions. This case lies within the unstable mass transfer (MT) regime as recently proposed of M33 X-7. The f = 1.01 case differed in stream geometry, accretion disk size, and efficiency, demonstrating nonconservative stable MT through a ballistic uniform-width stream. The nonconservative and stable nature of the f = 1.01 case MT also suggests that existing assumptions of semidetached binaries undergoing RLO may mischaracterize their role and distribution as progenitors of BBHs and common envelopes.

<div> 后验采样，贝叶斯方法，光度红移，星系性质，GPU加速<br />
<br />
这篇文章介绍了一个高效的贝叶斯方法，用于根据预先训练的种群模型(pop-cosmos)估算个别光度红移和星系性质。该模型使用基于分数的扩散模型规定了16个恒星种群合成（SPS）参数的先验分布，并包括对星云发射的详细处理数据模型。研究利用GPU加速的仿射不变合模器在COSMOS2020目录中的292,300个单独星系下，快速进行后验采样，利用神经网络模拟器(Speculator)加速SPS计算。比较了pop-cosmos种群模型和以Prospector-α为灵感的基准先验的结果，并将这些结果与广泛使用的EAZY和LePhare代码的已发布的COSMOS2020红移估计进行比较。针对具有光谱红移的∼12,000个星系，发现pop-cosmos给出了极小的偏差 (∼10−4)、高精度 (σMAD = 7 × 10−3) 和低离群值率 (1.6%)。研究表明pop-cosmos种群模型对比其r < 25 mag训练集更昏暗的星系具有良好的泛化能力。我们分析的样本比以前可能通过完整的SPS模型进行后验采样的样本大的约3倍，pop-cosmos先验下的平均吞吐量为每个星系15 GPU秒，而Prospector先验下为每个星系0.6 GPU秒。这为未来第四阶段星系调查中预期的大型目录的原则性建模铺平了道路。<br /><br />总结: 贝叶斯方法结合种群模型和GPU加速，实现了在大型星系目录中的高效后验采样，得到了准确的光度红移估计和星系性质推断，为未来的星系调查提供了重要的方法学基础。 <div>
We present an efficient Bayesian method for estimating individual photometric redshifts and galaxy properties under a pretrained population model (pop-cosmos) that was calibrated using purely photometric data. This model specifies a prior distribution over 16 stellar population synthesis (SPS) parameters using a score-based diffusion model, and includes a data model with detailed treatment of nebular emission. We use a GPU-accelerated affine-invariant ensemble sampler to achieve fast posterior sampling under this model for 292,300 individual galaxies in the COSMOS2020 catalog, leveraging a neural network emulator (Speculator) to speed up the SPS calculations. We apply both the pop-cosmos population model and a baseline prior inspired by Prospector-α, and compare these results to published COSMOS2020 redshift estimates from the widely used EAZY and LePhare codes. For the ∼12,000 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, we find that pop-cosmos yields redshift estimates that have minimal bias (∼10−4), high accuracy (σMAD = 7 × 10−3), and a low outlier rate (1.6%). We show that the pop-cosmos population model generalizes well to galaxies fainter than its r < 25 mag training set. The sample we have analyzed is ≳3× larger than has previously been possible via posterior sampling with a full SPS model, with average throughput of 15 GPU-sec per galaxy under the pop-cosmos prior, and 0.6 GPU-sec per galaxy under the Prospector prior. This paves the way for principled modeling of the huge catalogs expected from upcoming Stage IV galaxy surveys.

<div> 关键词: 银河系形成, 宇宙中午, 星际尘埃, 超级照相机, 颜色梯度
总结:
星系的颜色变化与其形成、增长、停滞历史和尘埃含量密切相关。在宇宙中午附近的 z ∼ 2 时期，星系的生长尤为重要，往往被称为“宇宙正午”，在这个时期星系平均达到了它们的星形成高峰。研究发现，我们在 z ∼ 1.6 附近的一个星团中观察到的星系，在 Hubble 太空望远镜的三个滤光片 F475W、F625W 和 F160W 中有明显的、具有统计学意义的差异。通过与类似红移的对照样本200个野外星系进行比较，我们发现了两种不同环境中星系的整体空间分辨率颜色和颜色梯度的明显差异。平均而言，星团中的星系在 r50 限定的内部和外部地区的紫外线颜色较红，同时外面向内的颜色梯度的离散程度更大。这些观察到的差异以及来自以前研究的辅助数据的证据强烈表明，环境通过影响恒星群和/或尘埃含量，驱动了这些整体颜色差异。 <div>
The changes in colors across a galaxy are intimately connected to the galaxy’s formation, growth, quenching history, and dust content. A particularly important epoch in the growth of galaxies is near z ∼ 2, often referred to as “cosmic noon,” where galaxies on average reach the peak of their star formation. We study a population of 125 cluster galaxies at z ∼ 1.6 in three Hubble Space Telescope filters, F475W, F625W, and F160W, roughly corresponding to the rest-frame far-ultraviolet, near-ultraviolet, and r band, respectively. By comparing to a control sample of 200 field galaxies at similar redshift, we reveal clear, statistically significant differences in the overall spatially resolved colors and color gradients in galaxies across these two different environments. On average, cluster galaxies have redder ultraviolet colors in both the inner and outer regions bounded by r50, as well as an overall wider dispersion of outside-in color gradients. The presence of these observed differences, along with evidence from ancillary data from previous studies, strongly suggests that the environment drives these population-level color differences, by affecting the stellar populations and/or dust content.

<div> 关键词: Coronal jets, solar atmosphere, magnetic reconnection, three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulation, eruptive events

总结: 论文报告了一个基于数据约束的三维磁流体力学模拟的结果，对太阳活动区NOAA AR12280中于2015年2月5日发生的一个喷发性射流进行了研究。通过模拟和差分发射测量分析结果的比较，提供了关于磁重连的启动和能谱特性的见解。研究捕捉了复杂的拓扑动力学，发现了喷流位置周围磁场和热演化之间的密切对应关系。这一综合方法丰富了对于由于磁流体力学过程引起的热演化的认识，对于揭示日冕加热问题有重要意义。 <br /><br /> <div>
Coronal jets are the captivating eruptions that are often found in the solar atmosphere and primarily formed due to magnetic reconnection. Despite their short-lived nature and lower energy compared to many other eruptive events, e.g., flares and coronal mass ejections, they play an important role in heating the corona and accelerating charged particles. However, their generation in the ambience of nonstandard flare regime is not fully understood, and warrant a deeper investigation, in terms of their onset, growth, eruption processes, and thermodynamic evolution. Toward this goal, this paper reports the results of a data-constrained three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation of an eruptive jet; initialized with a non-force-free-field (NFFF) extrapolation and carried out in the spirit of implicit large eddy simulation (ILES). The simulation focuses on the magnetic and dynamical properties of the jet during its onset, and eruption phases, that occurred on 2015 February 5 in an active region NOAA AR12280, associated with a seemingly three-ribbon structure. In order to correlate its thermal evolution with computed energetics, the simulation results are compared with differential emission measurement analysis in the vicinity of the jet. Importantly, this combined approach provides an insight to the onset of reconnection in transients in terms of emission and the corresponding electric current profiles from MHD evolutions. The presented study captures the intricate topological dynamics, finds a close correspondence between the magnetic and thermal evolution in and around the jet location. Overall, it enriches the understanding of the thermal evolution due to MHD processes, which is one of the broader aspects to reveal the coronal heating problem.

<br />
NGC 1266是一颗距离地球非常近的星后暴发星系，通过使用近红外积分场光谱仪进行观测，研究人员在中心区域探测到了H2 rovibrational发射线和弱的Brγ发射，这表明存在快速的持续性震撼活动。Brγ发射主要集中在中心区域，表明NGC 1266中可能仍存在星形成活动，而周围的冷分子气体则很少发生星形成。虽然不清楚Brγ发射的部分比例是来自于星形成还是活动星系核，假设完全来自于星形成活动，测得瞬时星形成率为0.7 M⊙ yr−1，然而在可能存在附加消光的情况下，星形成率可能会显著更高。NGC 1266是研究活动星系核、射流、震撼和星形成复杂相互作用的独特实验室，这些相互作用对于揭示星后暴发阶段演化过程至关重要。<br /><br />总结: NGC 1266是一颗星后暴发星系，观测结果显示存在持续的快速震撼活动和局部的星形成。通过研究这些复杂的相互作用，有助于了解星后暴发阶段的演化过程。 <div>
We present Gemini near-infrared integral field spectrograph K-band observations of the central 400 pc of NGC 1266, a nearby (D ≈ 30 Mpc) post-starburst galaxy with a powerful multiphase outflow and a shocked interstellar medium. We detect seven H2 rovibrational emission lines excited thermally to T ∼ 2000 K, and weak Brγ emission, consistent with a fast continuous shock (or C-shock). With these bright H2 lines, we observe the spatial structure of the shock with an unambiguous tracer for the first time. The Brγ emission is concentrated in the central ≲100 pc, indicating that any remaining star formation in NGC 1266 is in the nucleus, while the surrounding cold molecular gas has little ongoing star formation. Though it is unclear what fraction of this Brγ emission is from star formation or the active galactic nuclei (AGN), assuming it is entirely due to star formation we measure an instantaneous star formation rate of 0.7 M⊙ yr−1, though the star formation rate may be significantly higher in the presence of additional extinction. NGC 1266 provides a unique laboratory to study the complex interactions between AGN, outflows, shocks, and star formation, all of which are necessary to unravel the evolution of the post-starburst phase.

总结: 本文介绍了FAST在Commensal Radio Astronomy FAST Survey中发现的12颗脉冲星。对这些脉冲星进行了相位连通的定时计算、极化脉冲轮廓观测，以及法拉第旋转测量。其中发现了PSR J1840+2843存在亚脉冲漂移，而有五颗脉冲星表现出脉冲消失现象。此外，还发现两颗稳定自旋速率的孤立毫秒脉冲星，以及一对中子星-白矮星双星系统脉冲星。同时，FAST还发现了超出传统死亡线的两颗脉冲星，为测试脉冲星辐射理论提供了新样本。研究还根据NE2001和YMW16电子密度模型估算了这些脉冲星的距离，为研究银河系电子密度模型提供了数据。 <div>
We present phase-connected timing ephemerides, polarization pulse profiles, and Faraday rotation measurements of 12 pulsars discovered by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) in the Commensal Radio Astronomy FAST Survey. The observational data for each pulsar span at least 1 yr. Among them, PSR J1840+2843 shows subpulse drifting, and five pulsars are detected to exhibit pulse nulling phenomena. PSR J0640−0139 and PSR J2031−1254 are isolated millisecond pulsars (MSPs) with stable spin-down rates ( ) of 4.8981(6) × 10−20 s s−1 and 6.01(2) × 10−21 s s−1, respectively. Additionally, one pulsar (PSR J1602−0611) is in a neutron star−white dwarf (WD) binary system with an 18.23-day orbit and a companion of ≤0.65 M⊙. PSR J1602−0611 has a spin period, companion mass, and orbital eccentricity that are consistent with the theoretical expectations for MSP−helium WD (He WD) systems. Therefore, we believe that it might be an MSP−He WD binary system. The locations of PSR J1751−0542 and PSR J1840+2843 on the diagram are beyond the traditional death line. This indicates that FAST has discovered some low- pulsars, contributing new samples for testing pulsar radiation theories. We estimated the distances of these 12 pulsars based on NE2001 and YMW16 electron density models, and our work enhances the data set for investigating the electron density model of the Galaxy.

在这篇文章中，研究了原始黑洞（PBHs）对宇宙结构形成的影响，使用了半解析方法和宇宙学模拟。模拟中包含具有以10^6M⊙为中心的单色质量分布的PBHs，构成宇宙中10^-2到10^-4的暗物质（DM）部分，其余部分为无碰撞粒子暗物质。结果表明，PBHs对于引发大质量暗物质晕的形成并驻留在其中心具有“种子效应”。通过最近邻统计分析PBH宿主暗物质晕的相对分布，结果表明PBH宿主暗物质晕通过引力影响显著地影响了结构形成过程。如果PBHs构成的暗物质比例显著高于10^-3，几乎所有新形成的暗物质晕都会被PBH引发的晕吞并。因此，模拟预测了暗物质晕质量函数的双峰特征，其中大多数大质量暗物质晕的核心都包含至少一个PBH，其余为质量较小的非PBH暗物质晕。
<br /><br />总结: 原始黑洞对宇宙结构形成具有重要影响；模拟显示PBHs加速了大质量暗物质晕的形成；PBHs会影响新形成暗物质晕的分布；预测了暗物质晕质量函数的双峰特征。 <div>
We examine the effects of massive primordial black holes (PBHs) on cosmic structure formation, employing both a semianalytical approach and cosmological simulations. Our simulations incorporate PBHs with a monochromatic mass distribution centered around 106M⊙, constituting a fraction of 10−2 to 10−4 of the dark matter (DM) in the Universe, with the remainder being collisionless particle DM. Additionally, we conduct a ΛCDM simulation for comparative analysis with runs that include PBHs. At smaller scales, halos containing PBHs exhibit similar density and velocity dispersion profiles to those without PBHs. Conversely, at larger scales, PBHs can expedite the formation of massive halos and reside at their centers owing to the “seed effect.” To analyze the relative distribution of PBH host halos compared to non-PBH halos, we apply nearest neighbor statistics. Our results suggest that PBH host halos, through gravitational influence, significantly impact the structure formation process, compared to the ΛCDM case, by attracting and engulfing nearby newly formed minihalos. Should PBHs constitute a fraction of DM significantly larger than ∼10−3, almost all newly formed halos will be absorbed by PBH-seeded halos. Consequently, our simulations predict a bimodal feature in the halo mass function, with most of the massive halos containing at least one PBH at their core and the rest being less massive non-PBH halos.

We measure the absolute proper motion of Andromeda III (And III) using Advanced Camera for Surveys/Wide Field Channel and WFPC2 exposures spanning an unprecedented 22 yr time baseline. The WFPC2 exposures have been processed using a deep-learning centering procedure recently developed as well as an improved astrometric calibration of the camera. The absolute proper motion zero point is given by 98 galaxies and 16 Gaia EDR3 stars. The resulting proper motion is (μα, μδ) = (−10.5 ± 12.5, 47.5 ± 12.5) μas yr−1. We perform an orbit analysis of And III using two estimates of M31's mass and proper motion. We find that And III’s orbit is consistent with dynamical membership to the Great Plane of Andromeda system of satellites although with some looser alignment compared to the previous two satellites NGC 147 and NGC 185. And III is bound to M31 if M31's mass is Mvir ≥ 1.5 × 1012M⊙.

总结: 本文讨论了标准宇宙学模型在哈勃常数H0的超新星测量和宇宙微波背景辐射推断之间的张力，以及对当今宇宙加速的多种解释所需的新基本标量场的存在。作者提出了一个级联暗能量场景，通过将其简化为一个双场模型，并将其与宇宙微波背景辐射和宇宙中的测量结果进行比较，发现该场景改善了哈勃张力，提高了暗能量模型和宇宙中的测量结果之间的一致性。  <div>
The standard cosmological model is in the midst of a stress test, thanks to the tension between supernova-based measurements of the Hubble constant H0 and inferences of its values from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. Numerous explanations for the present-day cosmic acceleration require the presence of a new fundamental scalar field, as do early dark energy solutions to the Hubble tension. This raises the possibility that multiple fields cooperatively contribute to the dark energy component in bursts throughout cosmic time due to distinct initial conditions and couplings. Here, this cascading dark energy scenario is illustrated through a realization that effectively reduces to a two-field model, with two epochs in which dark energy is cosmologically significant. The model is compared to measurements of the CMB and baryon acoustic oscillations, as well as both PANTHEON and SH0ES observations of Type Ia supernovae. Neglecting the linear perturbations, it is found that this scenario ameliorates the Hubble tension, improving over purely late-time models of dark energy and the agreement between the galaxy survey measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations.

总结:<br /><br />本研究分析了围绕HD 111520星的不对称碎片盘，发现其中存在受行星-盘相互作用影响的结构和不对称性。使用REBOUND模拟了复杂的盘形态，以限制可能导致观测结构的行星的质量和轨道。研究发现，一个大约1木星质量、轨道离盘面有倾角的偏心行星可以重现大部分盘特征，包括弯曲、分叉和径向延伸的不对称性。另外，需要一个内部偏心行星才能产生亮度不对称，但无法完全重现观测到的2:1亮度不对称，这可能需要另一个机制。这项工作展示了仅凭碎片盘形态就可以了解整个系统的结构和演化，还可以提供行星约束，确定JWST/NIRCam和吉米尼行星成像仪2.0等当前/未来仪器的潜在目标。 <div>
Debris disks, which are optically thin, dusty disks around main-sequence stars, are often found to have structures and/or asymmetries associated with planet–disk interactions. Debris disk morphologies can hence be used as probes for planets in these systems, which are unlikely to be detected with other current exoplanet detection methods. In this study we take a look at the very asymmetrical debris disk around HD 111520, which harbours several signs of perturbation such as a “fork”-like structure in the NW, as well as a 4° warp from the midplane on either side of the disk. We simulate the complicated disk morphology using the code REBOUND, with the goal of constraining the possible mass and orbit of the planet responsible for the observed structures. We find that an ∼1 Mjup, eccentric planet that is inclined relative to the disk and is orbiting outside the warp location is able to reproduce the majority of disk features including the warp, fork, and radial extent asymmetry. To create the surface brightness asymmetry, a second eccentric planet is required inside the disk inner edge (50 au), although we are unable to produce the 2:1 brightness asymmetry observed, suggesting that a second mechanism may be required. Our work demonstrates how debris disk morphologies alone can be used to learn more about the architecture and evolution of a system as a whole, and can provide planet constraints to determine potential targets for current/future instruments such as JWST/NIRCam and the Gemini Planet Imager 2.0.

The dark matter subhalos orbiting in a galactic halo perturb the orbits of stars in thin stellar streams. Over time, the random velocities in the streams develop non-Gaussian wings. The rate of velocity increase is approximately a random walk at a rate proportional to the number of subhalos, primarily those in the mass range ≈106−7M⊙. The distribution of random velocities in long streams is measured in simulated Milky Way–like halos that develop in representative warm dark matter (WDM) and cold dark matter (CDM) cosmologies. The radial velocity distributions are well modeled as the sum of a Gaussian and an exponential. The resulting Markov Chain Monte Carlo fits find Gaussian cores of 1−2 km s−1 and exponential wings that increase from 3 km s−1 for 5.5 keV WDM, 4 km s−1 for 7 keV WDM, to 6 km s−1 for a CDM halo. The observational prospects to use stream measurements to constrain the nature of galactic dark matter are discussed.

<title>The Diffusion Tensor of Protons at 1 au: Comparing Simulation, Observation, and Theory</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The natural variation in plasma parameters observed at 1 au can lead to a variation in transport parameters, such as diffusion and drift coefficients, for energetic charged particles of solar and galactic origin. Given the importance of these parameters to particle transport studies, this variation is investigated through test particle simulations over a range of energies in the presence of simulated turbulence with properties corresponding to an ensemble of observed turbulence conditions at Earth. The resulting transport coefficients are then compared with observational estimates from the literature, as well as the predictions of several scattering theories. Parallel and perpendicular mean free paths are shown to vary widely, for the former in agreement with prior observational estimates, but not for the latter. Furthermore, a large disparity between the predictions of theory and the simulation results is noted for the perpendicular mean free path. As such, these results indicate that particle transport studies, particularly predictive ones, need to take into account this natural variation in transport coefficients.

<title>Chromospheric Modeling of the Active M3V Star G 80–21 with RH1.5D</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study investigates the active regions of the M3.0V star G 80–21 using the observed data from the CARMENES project with synthetic spectra generated by the RH1.5D radiative transfer code. The CARMENES project aims to search for exoplanets around M dwarfs using high-resolution near-infrared and optical echelle spectrographs. By comparing the observed data and models for the chromospheric lines of Hα and the bluest Ca ii infrared triplet line, we obtain the best-fit models for this star. The optimal fitting for the observed spectrum of G 80–21 is achieved by employing two active areas in conjunction with an inactive region, with a calcium abundance of [Ca/H] = −0.4. This combination successfully fits all the observed data across varying ratios. The minor active component consistently comprises approximately 18% of the total (ranging from 14% to 20%), which suggests that the minor active component is likely located in the polar regions. Meanwhile, the major active component occupies a variable proportion, ranging from 51% to 82%. Our method allows for the determination of the structure and size of stellar chromospheric active regions by analyzing high-resolution observed spectra.

<div> GRB, gravitational wave astronomy, afterglowpy, GW170817, Chandra X-ray observations
总结:
本文介绍了引力波天文学的到来以及越来越多以时间为重点的天文台观测的到来，这将导致对于与地球有适度倾斜的短γ射线暴（GRBs）的探测数量增加。由于这些事件距离我们很近，它们也是非常适合进行长期跟踪观测和长基线干涉测量的主要候选对象，这对于多信使建模、数据分析和应用于这些源的统计推断方法具有重要意义。文章更新了全面的建模，直接将GRB位置的星表观测、微弱源的泊松统计以及跨相对论电子种群的建模纳入到afterglowpy中。作者使用了革命性事件GW170817来展示这些扩展对于最佳拟合物理参数和模型选择方法的影响，这些方法评估了额外的迟发射分量的统计显著性。通过在分析中包括对GRB 170817A的最新Chandra X射线观测，作者发现在后期仅存在一些微弱证据（≲2σ）支持存在新的发射组分，这对于中心演化和外部介质密度预测更加自然。 <div>
The arrival of gravitational wave astronomy and a growing number of time-domain-focused observatories are set to lead to an increasing number of detections of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) launched with a moderate inclination to Earth. Being nearby events, these are also prime candidates for very long-term follow-up campaigns and very long-baseline interferometry, which has implications for multi-messenger modeling, data analysis, and statistical inference methods applied to these sources. Here, we present a comprehensive modeling update that directly incorporates into afterglowpy astrometric observations of the GRB position, Poissonian statistics for faint sources, and modeling of a trans-relativistic population of electrons. We use the revolutionary event GW170817 to demonstrate the impact of these extensions both for the best-fit physics parameters and model selection methods that assess the statistical significance of additional late-time emission components. By including in our analysis the latest Chandra X-ray observations of GRB 170817A, we find only weak evidence (≲2σ) for a new emission component at late times, which makes for a slightly more natural fit to the centroid evolution and prediction for the external medium density.

本文利用哈勃太空望远镜（HST）的空间望远镜成像光谱仪（STIS）光谱和宽视场相机3（WFC3）图像对15个附近（z <0.02）活动星系核（AGN）的狭线区域（NLR）和宿主星系的相互作用进行了研究。通过结合11个AGN的新HST WFC3连续光谱和[O III] λ5007图像，以及四个存档的AGN，与现有的HST STIS光谱相匹配。对六个AGN进行了适当的NLR长缝覆盖，并使用地面的等光面拟合图像、去除连续波段的[O III]图像和STIS光谱，解决、测量并将气体动力学投影到宿主星系盘面上，并区分NLR流出和星系旋转和/或动力学扰动的气体。研究发现，[O III]的平均范围约为680光年，与[O III]的亮度呈正相关。测得的范围强烈依赖于[O III]图像的深度，突出了在分析比例关系时采用统一阈值的重要性。流出气体的范围达到了NLR范围的39%至88%，并且发现所有六个具有其整个NLR的STIS覆盖的AGN都显示出强烈的流出动力学证据，尽管对于这些AGN以前存在不确定性。这表明NLR流出在中等光度AGN中普遍存在，并且标准的动力学建模标准对于识别流出是至关重要的。<br /><br />总结: 本研究利用Hubble Space Telescope对附近的活动星系核进行了研究，发现NLR流出在中等光度AGN中普遍存在，实现了对NLR动力学的测量和解析。流出范围与[O III]的亮度呈正相关，通过流出的测量，提出了标准的动力学建模标准。 <div>
Outflowing gas from supermassive black holes in the centers of active galaxies has been postulated as a major contributor to galactic evolution. To explore the interaction between narrow-line region (NLR) outflows and their host galaxies, we use Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) spectra and Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) images of 15 nearby (z < 0.02) active galactic nuclei (AGN) to determine the extents and geometries of their NLRs. We combine new HST WFC3 continuum and [O iii] λ5007 images of 11 AGN with four archival AGN to match existing spectra from HST STIS. For the six AGN with suitable long-slit coverage of their NLRs, we use isophotal fitting of ground-based images, continuum-subtracted [O iii] images, and the STIS spectra, to resolve, measure, and de-project the gas kinematics to the plane of the host galaxy disk and distinguish NLR outflows from galaxy rotation and/or kinematically disturbed gas. We find an average [O iii] extent of ∼680 pc with a correlation between gas extent and [O iii] luminosity of R[O III] ∝ . The measured extents depend strongly on the depth of the [O iii] images, highlighting the importance of adopting uniform thresholds when analyzing scaling relationships. The outflows reach from 39% to 88% of the full NLR extents, and we find that all six of the AGN with STIS coverage of their entire NLRs show strong kinematic evidence for outflows, despite previous uncertainty for these AGN. This suggests that NLR outflows are ubiquitous in moderate-luminosity AGN and that standard criteria for kinematic modeling are essential for identifying outflows.

总结: <br />
这篇文章讨论了软X射线（能量小于2keV）的高分辨率光谱需要采用衍射元件来解析天体物理学相关的诊断信息。Rowland准则描述了光栅和探测器的最佳位置以优化光谱分辨能力。文章提出了一种双倾斜Rowland光谱仪的概念，允许两个通道共享相同的探测器，并可以减少构建仪器时的对准要求。这种双倾斜Rowland光谱仪的概念对于次孔径镜特别有用，因为它可以有效利用航天器的入口孔径。其中应用了这一概念的任务之一是Arcus探测器。 <div>
High-resolution spectroscopy in soft X-rays (<2 keV) requires diffractive elements to resolve any astrophysically relevant diagnostics, such as closely spaced lines, weak absorption lines, or line profiles. The Rowland torus geometry describes how gratings and detectors need to be positioned to optimize the spectral resolving power. We describe how an on-axis Rowland geometry can be tilted to accommodate blazed gratings. In this geometry, two channels with separate optical axes can share the same detectors (double tilted Rowland spectrograph). Small offsets between the channels can mitigate the effect of chip gaps and reduce the alignment requirements during the construction of the instrument. The double tilted Rowland spectrograph concept is especially useful for subapertured mirrors, because it allows an effective use of space in the entrance aperture of a spacecraft. One mission that applies this concept is the Arcus Probe.

太阳辐射 总体趋势 卫星观测 数据复合 变化趋势
要点1: 自1978年以来进行了多次总太阳辐射（TSI）卫星任务
要点2: 不同卫星任务产生了略有不同的TSI基线和变化趋势
要点3: 出现了不同的数据复合策略和调整方法
要点4: 基于卫星数据产生了21种TSI时间序列
要点5: 开发了新的TSI数据集供科学界使用，提供了不同分辨率和版本

在自1978年以来的太阳总辐射（TSI）卫星任务中，各个任务产生了略有不同的TSI基线和变化趋势。一些团队通过调整单个任务的数据，显著减少了这些差异，而其他团队则更倾向于使用卫星科学小组发布的原始数据。这些数据组合方式也有所不同，有的将矛盾记录平均在一起，而有的更看重特定记录。研究人员比较了四种现有的组合数据以及基于可用卫星数据的17种新的替代系列。这些21个TSI系列被统计分为了6组，每组3到4个系列。研究发现，这六个组揭示了不同的太阳最小期间的变化趋势。研究人员还将这些组与八个每日分辨的太阳长期预测TSI重构和每日太阳黑子数进行了比较。他们发现，在一到两个太阳周期内取得了良好的一致性，但在更长的时间尺度上存在显著差异。因此，研究人员将所有这些时间序列（新旧）汇集成了一个大型的新TSI数据集，供科学界使用。这个数据集提供了不同分辨率和版本，可以比较地表的太阳变化或太阳与地球相互作用。 <div>
Several total solar irradiance (TSI) satellite missions have been carried out since 1978. None of these missions have lasted more than one to two solar cycles (SCs), and each mission implies a slightly different absolute TSI baseline. Nonetheless, several satellite composites have been developed by compositing satellite data from different missions to form an almost continuous daily record for the satellite era. However, disconcertingly, each mission has implied slightly different changes in TSI between consecutive solar minima and solar maxima. Some groups have developed adjustments to individual missions that have substantially reduced these differences. Others prefer to use the original data published by the satellite science teams. Some TSI composites average together conflicting records, while others prioritize specific records over others. Here, we compare four existing composites to 17 new alternative series based on the available satellite data. These 21 TSI series are statistically sorted into six groups of three to four series each. We found that the six groups suggest different intercycle trends between solar minima. We compare the groups to eight daily resolved solar proxy-based TSI reconstructions and to daily sunspot numbers. Excellent agreement is obtained over one to two SCs, but significant differences are observed over longer timescales for each group. Therefore, we have assembled all these time series (old and new) into a large and new TSI data set for use by the scientific community. Versions scaled to 1 au (for studying solar variability) or in situ values at Earth (for studying solar/terrestrial interactions) are provided at daily, monthly, and yearly resolutions.

Typical solar wind electrons are modeled as being composed of a dense but less energetic thermal “core” population plus a tenuous but energetic “halo” population with varying degrees of temperature anisotropies for both species. In this paper, we seek a fundamental explanation of how these solar wind core and halo electron temperature anisotropies are regulated by combined effects of collisions and instability excitations. The observed solar wind core/halo electron data in (β∥, T⊥/T∥) phase space show that their respective occurrence distributions are confined within an area enclosed by outer boundaries. Here, T⊥/T∥ is the ratio of perpendicular and parallel temperatures and β∥ is the ratio of parallel thermal energy to background magnetic field energy. While it is known that the boundary on the high-β∥ side is constrained by the temperature anisotropy-driven plasma instability threshold conditions, the low-β∥ boundary remains largely unexplained. The present paper provides a baseline explanation for the low-β∥ boundary based upon the collisional relaxation process. By combining the instability and collisional dynamics it is shown that the observed distribution of the solar wind electrons in the (β∥, T⊥/T∥) phase space is adequately explained, both for the “core” and “halo” components.

总结: <br /><br />这篇文章报告了使用XMM-Newton卫星上的Reflection Grating Spectrometer对原型星暴星系M82进行的深度观测，发现了一个快速的软X射线风。通过对O viii、Ne x和Mg xii等发射线的拟合，测量了氧、氖和镁等元素的速度分散，指出了氧具有显著高于逃逸速度的风速，而氖和镁的速度宽度较小，暗示了更低的风速或更小的开启角度。未来的研究将结合X射线成像和分光任务中的Resolve微量热传导仪观测结果，来进一步了解M82中的热星暴风的相位结构和能量预算。 <div>
Starburst wind models predict that metals and energy are primarily carried out of the disk by hot gas (T > 106 K), but the low energy resolution of X-ray CCD observations results in large uncertainties on the mass and energy loading. Here, we present evidence for a fast soft X-ray wind from the prototypical starburst galaxy M82 using deep archival observations from the Reflection Grating Spectrometer on XMM-Newton. After characterizing the complex line-spread function for the spatially extended outflow ( ), we perform emission-line fitting to measure the velocity dispersion, σv, from O viii (0.65, 0.77 keV), Ne x (1.02 keV), and Mg xii (1.47 keV). For the T ≈ 3 × 106 K gas, O viii yields a velocity dispersion of km s−1, implying a wind speed that is significantly above the escape velocity (vesc ≲ 450 km s−1). Ne x ( km s−1) and Mg xii (σv < 370 km s−1) show less velocity broadening than O viii, hinting at a lower wind speed or smaller opening angle on the more compact spatial scales traced by the T ≈ (0.6−1) × 107 K gas. Alternatively, these higher energy emission lines may be dominated by shock-heated gas in the interstellar medium. Future synthesis of these measurements with performance verification observations of the E = 2−12 keV wind in M82 from the Resolve microcalorimeter on the X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission will inform the phase structure and energy budget of the hot starburst wind.

总结:
本研究利用多维双爆炸模拟构建了真实的C/O白矮星，作为双爆炸模拟的起点。经过简化的一维爆炸计算，得出了壳层爆炸可以成功传播的条件。研究发现，大多数C/O白矮星可以支持双爆炸，而更大质量的C/O白矮星需要一定量的吸积才能成功传播爆炸。此外，研究强烈暗示，如果直接冲击吸积流在质量转移过程中达到足够高的温度和密度，吸积的白矮星将经历双爆炸。此外，如果伴星也是C/O白矮星，它在第一次爆炸的喷发影响下将经历自己的双爆炸。一些例外情况可能解释了新发现的高速超新星幸存者。 <div>
Double detonations of sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs (WDs) in unstably mass-transferring double WD binaries have become one of the leading contenders to explain most Type Ia supernovae. However, past theoretical studies of the explosion process have assumed relatively ad hoc initial conditions for the helium shells in which the double detonations begin. In this work, we construct realistic C/O WDs to use as the starting points for multidimensional double detonation simulations. We supplement these with simplified one-dimensional detonation calculations to gain a physical understanding of the conditions under which shell detonations can propagate successfully. We find that C/O WDs ≲1.0 M⊙, which make up the majority of C/O WDs, are born with structures that can support double detonations. More massive C/O WDs require ∼10−3M⊙ of accretion before detonations can successfully propagate in their shells, but such accretion may be common in the double WD binaries that host massive WDs. Our findings strongly suggest that if the direct impact accretion stream reaches high enough temperatures and densities during mass transfer from one WD to another, the accreting WD will undergo a double detonation. Furthermore, if the companion is also a C/O WD ≲1.0 M⊙, it will undergo its own double detonation when impacted by the ejecta from the first explosion. Exceptions to this outcome may explain the newly discovered class of hypervelocity supernova survivors.

There has been increasing evidence of shadows from scattered light observations of outer protoplanetary disks (PPDs) cast from the (unresolved) disk inner region, while in the meantime these disks present substructures of various kinds in the submillimeter. As stellar irradiation is the primary heating source for the outer PPDs, the presence of such shadows thus suggests inhomogeneous heating of the outer disk in azimuth, leading to a “thermal forcing” with dynamical consequences. We conduct a suite of idealized two-dimensional disk simulations of the outer disk with azimuthally varying cooling prescription to mimic the effect of shadows, generally assuming the shadow is static or slowly rotating. The linear response to such shadows is two-armed spirals with the same pattern speed as the shadow. Toward the nonlinear regime, we find that shadows can potentially lead to the formation of a variety of types of substructures including rings, spirals, and crescents, depending on viscosity, cooling time, etc. We have conducted systematic and statistical characterization of the simulation suite, and as thermal forcing from the shadow strengthens, the dominant form of shadow-induced disk substructures change from spirals to rings, and eventually to crescents/vortices. Our results highlight the importance of properly modeling the dynamical impact of inhomogeneous stellar irradiation, while calling for more detailed modeling incorporating more realistic disk physics.

Radio phoenices are complex and filamentary diffuse radio sources found in both merging and relaxed clusters. The formation of these sources has been proposed to be due to adiabatic compression of old active galactic nucleus plasma in shock waves. Most of the previous spectral studies of these sources have been limited to integrated spectral indices, which were found to be very steep and show a curved spectrum. Here, we have performed a multifrequency investigation of the radio phoenix in the A85 cluster. Owing to the sensitive high-resolution observations, we found some of the finer filamentary structures that had been previously undetected. We produced resolved spectral index maps of the radio phoenix between 323, 700, and 1280 MHz. The orientation of the filaments, as well as the gradient across the spectral index maps, suggest the possible direction of the shock motion from northeast to southwest. The integrated spectrum of the radio phoenix was found to be very steep and curved toward high frequencies. Furthermore, the spectral index of the filaments was found to be less steep compared to the nonfilamentary regions, implying greater energy injection in the filaments. The observed features in the radio phoenix in the A85 cluster seem to be in support of an adiabatic shock compression mechanism.

<div> PGC 39535, star formation, molecular gas, kinematics, star-forming main sequence<br />
总结:<br />这篇论文研究了一个巨大的S0星系PGC 39535，发现其星形成主要集中在中心区域，估计总星形成速率为1.57 M⊙ yr−1。通过NOEMA观测发现，分子气体主要集中在中心区域，呈现出类似的运动学特性。总分子气体质量为(5.42 ± 1.52) × 10^9M⊙。PGC 39535处于星形成主序上，但低于螺旋星系的Kennicutt–Schmidt关系，表明星形成效率可能受到巨大的星团的抑制。此外，分析结果表明PGC 39535位于一个巨大星系团的中心，其星形成历史表明它可能在过去的2-7亿年里经历了一系列富含气体的合并。 <div>
Lenticular galaxies (S0s) in the local Universe are generally absent of recent star formation and lack molecular gas. In this paper, we investigate one massive (M* ∼ 5 × 1010M⊙) star-forming S0, PGC 39535, with the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA). Using optical data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV Mapping Nearby Galaxies at the Apache Point Observatory survey, we find star formation mainly concentrates in the central region of PGC 39535. The total star formation rate estimated using extinction-corrected Hα flux is 1.57 M⊙ yr−1. The results of the NOEMA observation suggest that the molecular gas mainly concentrates in the central regions as a gaseous bar and a ring-like structure, and shows similar kinematics as the stellar and ionized gas components. The total molecular gas mass estimated from CO(1–0) is (5.42 ± 1.52) × 109M⊙. We find PGC 39535 lies on the star-forming main sequence but falls below the Kennicutt–Schmidt relation of spiral galaxies, suggesting that the star formation efficiency may be suppressed by the massive bulge. The existence of a second Gaussian component in the CO spectrum of the central region indicates possible gas flows. Furthermore, our analyses suggest that PGC 39535 resides in the center of a massive group and the derived star formation history indicates it may experience a series of gas-rich mergers over the past 2–7 Gyr.

这篇文章研究了中子星与暗物质存在的可能性。作者使用相对论中的双流体形式，通过数值模拟稳定的暗物质掺杂中子星的配置。他们探讨了不同暗物质模型对暗物质质量分布的影响，以及暗物质对X射线流量的影响。研究结果表明，暗物质的存在可能会影响中子星质量和半径的测量，以及对强子物质方程状态的约束。总结：<br /><br /> <div>
The high densities of neutron stars (NSs) could provide astrophysical locations for dark matter (DM) to accumulate. Depending on the DM model, these DM admixed NSs (DANSs) could have significantly different properties than pure baryonic NSs, accessible through X-ray observations of rotation-powered pulsars. We adopt the two-fluid formalism in general relativity to numerically simulate stable configurations of DANSs, assuming a fermionic equation of state (EOS) for the DM with repulsive self-interaction. The distribution of DM in the DANS as a halo affects the path of X-rays emitted from hot spots on the visible baryonic surface, causing notable changes in the pulse profile observed by telescopes such as NICER, compared to pure baryonic NSs. We explore how various DM models affect the DM mass distribution, leading to different types of dark halos. We quantify the deviation in observed X-ray flux from stars with each of these halos. We identify the pitfalls in interpreting mass and radius measurements of NSs inferred from electromagnetic radiation and constraining the baryonic matter EOS if these dark halos exist.

<div> 太阳，射电辐射，空间结构，观测，辐射爆发
<br /><br />总结: 本研究利用升级的Giant Metrewave射电望远镜的高角分辨率观测，发现可以探测到角尺度小至约9″的结构，比以往关于太阳射电辐射爆发观测报告的最小结构约小了三倍。观测结果表明，虽然单个I型爆发具有窄带特性，但这些爆发可能是由于在不同日冕高度诱发磁重联的行进扰动导致的，因此导致在广泛频率范围内观察到的I型爆发的形态发生相关变化。这一发现对于与极紫外线/ X射线波段的观测进行时空关联，以了解这些辐射的详细性质非常重要。 <div>
Type-I solar noise storms are perhaps the most commonly observed active radio emissions from the Sun at meter-wavelengths. Noise storms have a long-lived and wideband continuum background with superposed islands of much brighter narrowband and short-lived emissions, known as type-I bursts. There is a serious paucity of studies focusing on the morphology of these two types of emissions, primarily because of the belief that coronal scattering will always wash out any features at small angular scales. However, it is important to investigate their spatial structures in detail to make a spatio-temporal connection with observations at extreme-ultraviolet/X-ray bands to understand the detailed nature of these emissions. In this work, we use high angular resolution observations from the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope to demonstrate that it is possible to detect structures with angular scales as small as ∼9″, about three times smaller than the smallest structure reported to date from noise storms. Our observations also suggest that while the individual type-I bursts are narrowband in nature, the bursts are probably caused by traveling disturbance(s) inducing magnetic reconnections at different coronal heights, and thus leading to correlated change in the morphology of the type-I bursts observed at a wide range of frequencies.

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has enabled the discovery of numerous tidally tilted pulsators (TTPs), which are pulsating stars in close binaries where the presence of a tidal bulge has the effect of tilting the primary star’s pulsation axes into the orbital plane. Recently, the modeling framework developed to analyze TTPs has been applied to the emerging class of triaxial pulsators, which exhibit nonradial pulsations about three perpendicular axes. In this work, we report on the identification of the second-ever discovered triaxial pulsator, with 16 robustly detected pulsation multiplets, of which 14 are dipole doublets separated by 2νorb. We jointly fit the spectral energy distribution and TESS light curve of the star, and find that the primary is slightly evolved off the zero-age main sequence, while the less massive secondary still lies on the zero-age main sequence. Of the 14 doublets, we associate eight with Y10x modes and six with novel Y10y modes. We exclude the existence of Y11x modes in this star and show that the observed pulsation modes must be Y10y. We also present a toy model for the triaxial pulsation framework in the context of this star. The techniques presented here can be utilized to rapidly analyze and confirm future triaxial pulsator candidates.

Barred galaxies exhibit boxy/peanut or X-shapes (BP/X) protruding from their disks in edge-on views. Two types of BP/X morphologies exist depending on whether the X-wings meet at the center (CX) or are off-centered (OX). Orbital studies indicate that various orbital types can generate X-shaped structures. Here we provide a classification approach that identifies the specific orbit families responsible for generating OX- and CX-shaped structures. Applying this approach to three different N-body bar models, we show that both OX and CX structures are associated with the x1 orbit family, but OX-supporting orbits possess higher angular momentum (closer to x1 orbits) than orbits in CX structures. Consequently, as the bar slows down, the contribution of higher angular momentum OX-supporting orbits decreases and that of lower angular momentum orbits increases, resulting in an evolution of the morphology from OX to CX. If the bar does not slow down, the shape of the BP/X structure and the fractions of OX/CX-supporting orbits remain substantially unchanged. Bars that do not undergo buckling but that do slow down initially show the OX structure and are dominated by high angular momentum orbits, transitioning to a CX morphology. Bars that buckle exhibit a combination of both OX- and CX-supporting orbits immediately after the buckling but become more CX dominated as their pattern speed decreases. This study demonstrates that the evolution of BP/X morphology and orbit populations strongly depends on the evolution of the bar angular momentum.

<title>Probing the Dust Grain Alignment Mechanisms in Spiral Galaxies with M51 as the Case Study</title>

Magnetic fields (B fields) in galaxies have recently been traced using far-infrared and submillimeter polarimetric observations with the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The main assumption is that dust grains are magnetically aligned with the local B-field in the interstellar medium (ISM). However, the range of physical conditions of the ISM, dust grain sizes, and B-field strengths in galaxies where this assumption is valid has not been characterized yet. Here, we use the well-studied spiral galaxy M51 as a case study. We find that the timescale for the alignment mechanism arising from magnetically aligned dust grains (B-RAT) dominates over other alignment mechanisms, including radiative precession (k-RAT) and mechanical alignment (v-MAT), as well as the randomization effect (gas damping). We estimate the sizes of the aligned dust grain to be in the range of 0.009–0.182 μm and 0.019–0.452 μm for arms and interarms, respectively. We show that the difference in the polarization fraction between arms and interarms may arise from the enhancement of small dust grain sizes in the arms resulting from large grains being broken into small grains as an effect of the grain alignment disruption (RAT-D) mechanism. We argue that the RAT-D mechanism needs to have additional effects, e.g., intrinsic variations of the B-field structure and turbulence, in the galaxy’s components to fully explain the polarization fraction variations within the arms and interarms.

This study investigated the mechanisms of vorticity generation and the role of vortex tubes in plasma heating and energy transport. Vortex tubes were identified using the instantaneous vorticity deviation technique in the MURaM data set of a simulated solar plage region of the solar photosphere. Within 3D kinetic vortex tubes, the misalignment of the magnetic pressure and the inverse of the density gradient, rather than baroclinic effects, primarily drive vorticity within the tubes. During their lifetime, vortices become less dense as the Lorentz force pushes plasma outwards against pressure gradients. In the simulated upper photosphere, the Lorentz force contributes to adiabatic cooling and heating by expanding or compressing the plasma around the vortex tubes. In turn, vortex motion affects the magnetic field, enhancing current generation and intensifying the Lorentz force, which may further increase adiabatic cooling and heating. Moreover, our results confirm that vortices can significantly boost viscous and ohmic heating on intergranular scales in the photosphere. They generate more magnetic than kinetic energy, with energy transport by Poynting flux notably nonuniform and dominant at the vortex boundaries. This creates energy circulation in which the net upwards Poynting flux can enhance chromospheric plasma heating and support chromospheric temperatures.

We propose a Bayesian inference framework to predict the merger history of LIGO-Virgo binary black holes (BHs), whose binary components may have undergone hierarchical mergers in the past. The framework relies on numerical relativity predictions for the mass, spin, and kick velocity of the remnant BHs. This proposed framework computes the masses, spins, and kicks imparted to the remnant of the parent binaries, given the initial masses and spin magnitudes of the binary constituents. We validate our approach by performing an “injection study” based on a constructed sequence of hierarchically formed binaries. Noise is added to the final binary in the sequence, and the parameters of the “parent” and “grandparent” binaries in the merger chain are then reconstructed. This method is then applied to three GWTC-3 events: GW190521, GW200220_061928, and GW190426_190642. These events were selected because at least one of the binary companions lies in the putative pair-instability supernova mass gap, in which stellar processes alone cannot produce BHs. Hierarchical mergers offer a natural explanation for the formation of BHs in the pair-instability mass gap. We use the backward evolution framework to predict the parameters of the parents of the primary companion of these three binaries. For instance, the parent binary of GW190521 has masses and within the 90% credible interval. Astrophysical environments with escape speeds ≥100 km s−1 are preferred sites to host these events. Our approach can be readily applied to future high-mass gravitational wave events to predict their formation history under the hierarchical merger assumption.

We compare two-moment-based energy-dependent and three variants of energy-integrated neutrino transport general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of a hypermassive neutron star. To study the impacts due to the choice of the neutrino transport schemes, we perform simulations with the same setups and input neutrino microphysics. We show that the main differences between energy-dependent and energy-integrated neutrino transport are found in the disk and ejecta properties, as well as in the neutrino signals. The properties of the disk surrounding the neutron star and the ejecta in energy-dependent transport are very different from the ones obtained using energy-integrated schemes. Specifically, in the energy-dependent case, the disk is more neutron-rich at early times and becomes geometrically thicker at later times. In addition, the ejecta is more massive and, on average, more neutron-rich in the energy-dependent simulations. Moreover, the average neutrino energies and luminosities are about 30% higher. Energy-dependent neutrino transport is necessary if one wants to better model the neutrino signals and matter outflows from neutron star merger remnants via numerical simulations.

Observational advances have allowed the detection of galaxies, protoclusters, and galaxy clusters at higher and higher redshifts, opening a new view into extreme galaxy evolution. I present an argument that the high-redshift, massive galaxies discovered over the last decade are really the most massive galaxies within protocluster cores of galaxy clusters at z ∼ 2, and that they are the partial descendants of same galaxies discovered by JWST at z ∼ 9. To that end, I present The Manhattan Suite, a set of 100 high resolution zoom-in simulations of the most massive galaxy clusters, out to 9 Rvir, selected at z = 2 from a (1.5 cGpc)3 parent volume, and simulated using the simba model. Unlike other cluster suites, my selection at z = 2 ensures that these systems are biased in a similar fashion to observations, in that they should be the brightest and the most massive by construction at z ≳ 2. I show that my sample is able to reproduce extremely star-bursting protoclusters such as SPT2349-56, high-redshift galaxy clusters XLSSC122 and JKCS041, and the wealth of massive (sometimes quenched) galaxies at z ≳ 3 and up to z ∼ 9. I argue that these systems are intimately linked, and represent the same evolutionary history.

总结:
Mg ii h和k共振线极化是散射过程和磁场诱导的Hanle、Zeeman和磁光效应的共同作用结果，对太阳色球磁场的诊断具有重要潜力。2019年进行的Chromospheric LAyer Spectro-Polarimeter sounding-rocket实验成功地测量了两个不同区域的Stokes参数随波长的变化。通过应用HanleRT Tenerife反演代码，可以根据Stokes参数剖面提供磁场矢量的估计。非磁性对称性破坏的原因对线偏振剖面有重要影响，而在静止区像素中，磁场强度在上色球层的估计值在1至20 G之间变化。 <div>
The polarization of the Mg ii h and k resonance lines is the result of the joint action of scattering processes and the magnetic field–induced Hanle, Zeeman, and magneto-optical effects, thus holding significant potential for the diagnostic of the magnetic field in the solar chromosphere. The Chromospheric LAyer Spectro-Polarimeter sounding-rocket experiment, carried out in 2019, successfully measured at each position along the 196″ spectrograph slit the wavelength variation of the four Stokes parameters in the spectral region of this doublet around 280 nm, both in an active-region plage and in a quiet region close to the limb. We consider some of these CLASP2 Stokes profiles and apply to them the recently developed HanleRT Tenerife Inversion Code, which assumes a one-dimensional model atmosphere for each spatial pixel under consideration (i.e., it neglects the effects of horizontal radiative transfer). We find that the nonmagnetic causes of symmetry breaking, due to the horizontal inhomogeneities and the gradients of the horizontal components of the macroscopic velocity in the solar atmosphere, have a significant impact on the linear polarization profiles. By introducing such nonmagnetic causes of symmetry breaking as parameters in our inversion code, we can successfully fit the Stokes profiles and provide an estimation of the magnetic field vector. For example, in the quiet region pixels, where no circular polarization signal is detected, we find that the magnetic field strength in the upper chromosphere varies between 1 and 20 G.

Stellar magnetic fields have a major impact on space weather around exoplanets orbiting low-mass stars. From an analysis of Zeeman-broadened Fe i lines measured in near-infrared SDSS/APOGEE spectra, mean magnetic fields are determined for a sample of 29 M dwarf stars that host closely orbiting small exoplanets. The calculations employed the radiative transfer code Synmast and MARCS stellar model atmospheres. The sample M dwarfs are found to have measurable mean magnetic fields ranging between ∼0.2 and ∼1.5 kG, falling in the unsaturated regime on the 〈B〉 versus Prot plane. The sample systems contain 43 exoplanets, which include 23 from Kepler, nine from K2, and nine from Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. We evaluated their equilibrium temperatures, insolation, and stellar habitable zones and found that only Kepler-186f and TOI-700d are inside the habitable zones of their stars. Using the derived values of 〈B〉 for the stars Kepler-186 and TOI-700 we evaluated the minimum planetary magnetic field that would be necessary to shield the exoplanets Kepler-186f and TOI-700d from their host star’s winds, considering reference magnetospheres with sizes equal to those of the present-day and young Earth, respectively. Assuming a ratio of 5% between large- to small-scale B-fields, and a young-Earth magnetosphere, Kepler-186f and TOI-700d would need minimum planetary magnetic fields of, respectively, 0.05 and 0.24 G. These values are considerably smaller than Earth’s magnetic field of 0.25 G ≲ B ≲ 0.65 G, which suggests that these two exoplanets might have magnetic fields sufficiently strong to protect their atmospheres and surfaces from stellar magnetic fields.

<br />总结:<br />本研究利用“宇宙再电离计算”模拟中的合成类星体光谱，研究了5.2 < z < 6.8范围内的Lyman-alpha (Lyα)传输峰。重点在于理解这些峰与星系间介质（IGM）属性之间的关系。通过采用可解释的机器学习算法Explainable Boosting machines，量化了各种IGM属性对Lyα流量的相对影响。研究结果显示，气体密度是影响吸收强度的主要因素，其次是背景辐射的强度和IGM的温度。本研究挑战了最近一些观测研究对这些峰来源的假设，证明了Lyα传输峰在很大程度上是大尺度结构的产物，而星系只是偏向探测器。 <div>
We investigate Lyman-alpha (Lyα) transmission spikes at 5.2 < z < 6.8 using synthetic quasar spectra from the “Cosmic Reionization on Computers” simulations. We focus on understanding the relationship between these spikes and the properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Disentangling the complex interplay between IGM physics and the influence of galaxies on the generation of these spikes presents a significant challenge. To address this, we employ Explainable Boosting machines, an interpretable machine learning algorithm, to quantify the relative impact of various IGM properties on the Lyα flux. Our findings reveal that gas density is the primary factor influencing absorption strength, followed by the intensity of background radiation and the temperature of the IGM. Ionizing radiation from local sources (i.e., galaxies) appears to have a minimal effect on Lyα flux. The simulations show that transmission spikes predominantly occur in regions of low gas density. Our results challenge recent observational studies suggesting the origin of these spikes in regions with enhanced radiation. We demonstrate that Lyα transmission spikes are largely a product of the large-scale structure, of which galaxies are biased tracers.

We present a suite of six high-resolution chemodynamical simulations of isolated galaxies, spanning observed disk-dominated environments on the star-forming main sequence, as well as quenched, bulge-dominated environments. We compare and contrast the physics driving star formation and stellar feedback among the galaxies, with a view to modeling these processes in cosmological simulations. We find that the mass loading of galactic outflows is coupled to the clustering of supernova explosions, which varies strongly with the rate of galactic rotation Ω = vcirc/R via the Toomre length, leading to smoother gas disks in the bulge-dominated galaxies. This sets an equation of state in the star-forming gas that also varies strongly with Ω, so that the bulge-dominated galaxies have higher midplane densities, lower velocity dispersions, and higher molecular gas fractions than their main-sequence counterparts. The star formation rate in five out of six galaxies is independent of Ω and is consistent with regulation by the midplane gas pressure alone. In the sixth galaxy, which has the most centrally concentrated bulge and thus the highest Ω, we reproduce dynamical suppression of the star formation efficiency in agreement with observations. This produces a transition away from pressure-regulated star formation.

<title>Quantifying the Expanding and Cooling Effects into the Double Adiabatic Evolution of the Solar Wind Through the Expanding Box Model</title>

<div> 关键词: 太阳风，等熵不变量，拓展盒模型，磁场，等离子体动力学
总结: 
太阳风扩张动力学是空间物理中的一个基本问题，与等离子体反应紧密相关。文章通过拓展盒模型重新审视了Chew-Goldberger-Low（CGL）理论，主要目的是分离扩张效应，探讨等熵不变量的保守性。研究发现，如果通过拓展盒模型引入等离子体冷却效应，双绝热方程将不再保守，其演化与CGL理论以及实验观测存在偏差。这一偏差归因于等离子体扩张引起的冷却效应，同时表明加热机制在抵消等离子体冷却过程中起着重要作用。 <div>
One of the fundamental problems in space physics is the expansion dynamics of the solar wind, strongly correlated with collective plasma reactions, such as wave instabilities that tend to relax kinetic anisotropies. The expansion is in general described through the double adiabatic or Chew–Goldberger–Low (CGL) theory, which sets the main ideas and plasma expansion’s major role in describing plasma cooling/heating dynamics. Here, using the expanding box model (EBM) we revisit the CGL description including plasma expansion. Our primary objective is to isolate the expanding effects into the conservation of the double adiabatic invariants, a key aspect of the CGL theory. Following the same approximations and assumptions as in EBM and CGL theory, we developed a CGL-like description in which the expansion modifies the conservation of the double adiabatic invariants. Our results show that the double adiabatic equations are no longer conserved if plasma cooling is introduced through the EBM, with explicit dependence on expanding parameters, magnetic field profiles, and velocity gradients. Solving the equations for different magnetic field and density profiles (obtained self-consistently through the equations), we compute the evolution of temperature anisotropy and plasma beta, which deviates from CGL predictions and empirical observations. This deviation is attributed to the plasma cooling effect induced by the expansion of the plasma. The results suggest that heating mechanisms even play a major role in counteracting plasma cooling during expansion.

<div> JWST, supernovae, distance indicators, Hubble constant, TRGB<br />
总结:<br />
文章介绍了JWST在空间中使用6.5米镜面来提高超新星数量的测量精度。通过对Virgo星系团中NGC 4536的观测，展示了JWST计划GO-1995的目标是利用三种恒星距离指示器（Cepheids、TRGB和J-分支渐近巨星支/碳星）来测量Hubble常数。文章验证了可以从每种方法中获得精确到约0.05等级的距离测量。作者使用Hubble Space Telescope成像来识别TRGB星，并与JWST光度进行交叉匹配，并对TRGB的F115W与（F115W-F444W）关系进行了初步约束。利用新的TRGB斜率估计来平整2D TRGB特征，并相对于一组标准TRGB颜色测量了TRGB距离。文章最终证明了TRGB可以作为JWST可访问的红外波长下的标准化光源。 <div>
Boasting a 6.5 m mirror in space, JWST can increase by several times the number of supernovae (SNe) to which a redshift-independent distance has been measured with a precision distance indicator (e.g., tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) or Cepheids); the limited number of such SN calibrators currently dominates the uncertainty budget in distance ladder Hubble constant (H0) experiments. JWST/NIRCAM imaging of the Virgo Cluster galaxy NGC 4536 is used here to preview JWST program GO-1995, which aims to measure H0 using three stellar distance indicators (Cepheids, TRGB, and J-branch asymptotic giant branch/carbon stars). Each population of distance indicator was here successfully detected—with sufficiently large number statistics, well-measured fluxes, and characteristic distributions consistent with ingoing expectations—so as to confirm that we can acquire distances from each method precise to about 0.05 mag (statistical uncertainty only). We leverage overlapping Hubble Space Telescope imaging to identify TRGB stars, crossmatch them with the JWST photometry, and present a preliminary constraint on the slope of the TRGB’s F115W versus (F115W – F444W) relation equal to −0.99 ± 0.16 mag mag−1. This slope is consistent with prior slope measurements in the similar Two Micron All-Sky Survey J band, as well as with predictions from the BaSTI isochrone suite. We use the new TRGB slope estimate to flatten the 2D TRGB feature and measure a (blinded) TRGB distance relative to a set of fiducial TRGB colors, intended to represent the absolute fiducial calibrations expected from geometric anchors such as NGC 4258 and the Magellanic Clouds. In doing so, we empirically demonstrate that the TRGB can be used as a standardizable candle at the IR wavelengths accessible with JWST.

<br /><br />
这篇文章讨论了非常金属贫的星星（VMP，[Fe/H] ≤ −2），它们在α元素（如镁、硅和钙）上的丰度比太阳丰度还要低，称为α较低的VMP星星。它们通常与核心坍缩超新星有关，但研究发现其中一颗星SDSS J0018-0939可能具有亚钱德拉塞卡质量的白矮星引发的Ia型超新星的特征，这表明亚钱德拉塞卡质量的白矮星引发的Ia型超新星可能是早期银河系中Ia型超新星的主要来源，有可能占到50%至75%的比例。 <div>
Very metal-poor (VMP) stars ([Fe/H] ≤ −2) that have subsolar values of [X/Fe] for α elements such as Mg, Si, and Ca, are referred to as α-poor VMP stars. They are quite rare among VMP stars and are thought to have formed from gas enriched predominantly by a single Type Ia supernova (SN 1a) in contrast to most VMP stars, which are α-enhanced and usually associated with core-collapse supernovae. The observed abundance pattern in such stars can provide a direct way to probe the nucleosynthesis in individual SN 1a. Although the abundance patterns in some α-poor VMP stars have been shown to be consistent with SN 1a ejecta, a clear nucleosynthetic signature for SN 1a resulting from the explosion of a near Chandrasekhar mass (near-MCh) or a sub-Chandrasekhar mass (sub-MCh) white dwarf, has not been unambiguously detected. We perform a detailed analysis of various formation channels of VMP stars and find that the α-poor VMP star SDSS J0018-0939, which was earlier reported as a star with potential pair-instability supernova origin, provides a near-smoking-gun signature of a sub-MCh SN 1a resulting from He detonation. We find that compared to other α-poor VMP stars that were previously identified with SN 1a, SDSS J0018-0939 is the only star that has a clear and unambiguous signature of SN 1a. Interestingly, our results are consistent with constraints on SN1 a from recent galactic chemical evolution studies that indicate that sub-MCh SN 1a accounts for ∼50%–75% of all SN 1a and is possibly the dominant channel in the early Galaxy.

总结: <br />
本研究利用高分辨率三维全球磁流体力学模拟，研究了Ganymede磁层的Alfvén波空间分布，并基于Juno的飞越测量绘制了Ganymede电离层表面的Alfvén波椭圆。研究结果显示，模拟的Alfvén波椭圆与观察到的极光椭圆非常相似，但模拟得到的Alfvén波Poynting流量明显低于基于极光辐射度估算出的数值。此外，研究还发现，OCFB与Alfvén波功率增强的极地（赤道）边界紧密对齐，磁层通量管输运模式可以引导Alfvén波包向OCFB下游/上游侧的赤道或极地纬度传播。这些研究结果为Juno任务和未来的JUICE任务提供了可检验的预测。 <div>
Alfvén waves generated by the interactions between the Ganymede magnetosphere and the fast-corotating Jovian plasma carry a significant amount of energy. This energy is partially transferred to precipitating particles, which correspond to a feature called the Alfvénic oval. However, the spatial distribution of the Alfvénic oval in the Ganymede system is unclear, and the physical correlation between the Alfvénic oval and the open–closed field line boundary (OCFB) has not been studied quantitatively. Using a high-resolution, three-dimensional global magnetohydrodynamics simulation of Ganymede's magnetosphere, we investigate the spatial distribution of the Alfvénic oval mapped on the ionosphere surface of Ganymede based on upstream measurements from Juno's PJ34 flyby. Our results show that (1) the simulated Alfvénic oval of Ganymede closely resembles the observed aurora oval, and although without kinetic physics, the magnitude of the simulated Afvénic Poynting flux is significantly lower than the estimation based on auroral luminosity; (2) the OCFB aligns closely with the poleward (equatorial) boundary of the enhanced Alfvénic power on the downstream (upstream) side; and (3) the magnetospheric flux tube convection pattern can guide the Alfvénic wave packet to propagate toward latitudes either equatorward or poleward of the OCFB on the downstream/upstream side. These results, presented for the first time in this study, provide testable predictions for both the ongoing Juno mission and future Jovian missions such as JUICE probing the minimagnetosphere system.

During geomagnetic storms, which are the primary periods for heavy ions from the solar wind to enter Earth’s magnetospheric space, the charge state of solar wind heavy ions during these storms has significant implications for studying the distribution and effects of heavy ions in the magnetosphere. We analyzed the states and variations of heavy ions during 158 interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME)–driven geomagnetic storm events using data from the Advanced Composition Explorer satellite and examined four of these events in detail. We found that the increase in the average charge state of heavy ions such as O, Mg, Si, and Fe is positively correlated with the intensity of the geomagnetic storm. Regarding the abundance ratio of heavy ions such as Ne, Mg, Si, and Fe relative to oxygen ions, the rate and magnitude of increase in abundance ratios during extreme geomagnetic storms (Kp = 9) triggered by ICME events are significantly higher than those during other levels of geomagnetic storms. Additionally, we observed that although the average charge states of heavy ions such as O and Fe are correlated with the geomagnetic storm intensity induced by ICMEs, there are significant individual differences in the charge state variations of heavy ions.

总结:本研究使用Illustris TNG100模拟，量化了孤立低质量和高质量主要星系对的并合时间尺度随宇宙时间变化的情况，并探讨了不同选择标准对并合时间尺度的质量和红移依赖性的影响。作者提出了一种基于物理原理的框架，通过缩放分离标准来选择星系对，结果发现在所有红移下，应用这种缩放分离标准可以得到等效的低质量和高质量星系对的并合时间尺度。另外，对所有星系对应用静态物理分离选择标准会导致低质量星系对和高质量星系对的并合率差异高达约1亿年，尤其是在rsep < 150 kpc的情况下。因此，对物理分离选择的星系对应用相同的并合时间尺度会导致一种偏差，系统性地高估低质量星系的并合率。 <div>
The merger timescales of isolated low-mass pairs (108 < M* < 5 × 109M⊙) on cosmologically motivated orbits have not yet been studied in detail, though isolated high-mass pairs (5 × 109 < M* < 1011M⊙) have been studied extensively. It is common to apply the same separation criteria and expected merger timescales of high-mass pairs to low-mass systems, however, it is unclear if their merger timescales are similar, or if they evolve similarly with redshift. We use the Illustris TNG100 simulation to quantify the merger timescales of isolated low-mass and high-mass major pairs as a function of cosmic time, and explore how different selection criteria impact the mass and redshift dependence of merger timescales. In particular, we present a physically motivated framework for selecting pairs via a scaled separation criterion, wherein pair separations are scaled by the virial radius of the primary’s Friends-of-Friends (FoF) group halo (rsep < 1 Rvir). Applying these scaled separation criteria yields equivalent merger timescales for both mass scales at all redshifts. Alternatively, static physical separation selections applied equivalently to all galaxy pairs at all redshifts lead to a difference in merger rate of up to ∼1 Gyr between low- and high-mass pairs, particularly for rsep < 150 kpc. As a result, applying the same merger timescales to physical-separation-selected pairs will lead to a bias that systematically overpredicts low-mass galaxy merger rates.

总结:
Faraday rotation是探测活动星系核喷流周围磁场和磁化等离子体的重要方法。本文利用ALMA在85.2至101.3 GHz范围内获得了M87喷流的Faraday rotation测量图像。研究发现M87核心的RM为(4.5 ± 0.4) × 104 rad m−2，线偏振分数为(0.88 ± 0.08)%。M87喷流的空间RM梯度范围广泛，从∼ −2 × 104 rad m−2到∼3 × 104 rad m−2。与先前的RM测量结果相比，表明核心的Faraday旋转可能起源于超大质量黑洞非常近的位置。喷流的RM梯度表明磁场呈螺旋状，并一直延续到千秒差距尺度。结合较低频率下的千秒差距尺度RM测量结果，发现RM与频率有关，可能的解释是，千秒差距尺度喷流呈喇叭形状，在末端磁场呈螺旋状并逐渐解开。<br /><br /> <div>
Faraday rotation is an important probe of the magnetic fields and magnetized plasma around active galactic nuclei jets. We present a Faraday rotation measure (RM) image of the M87 jet between 85.2 and 101.3 GHz with a resolution of ∼2″ with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We found that the RM of the M87 core is (4.5 ± 0.4) × 104 rad m−2 with a low linear polarization fraction of (0.88 ± 0.08)%. The spatial RM gradient in the M87 jet spans a wide range from ∼ −2 × 104 rad m−2 to ∼3 × 104 rad m−2 with a typical uncertainty of 0.3 × 104 rad m−2. A comparison with previous RM measurements of the core suggests that the Faraday rotation of the core may originate very close to the supermassive black hole. Both an internal origin and an external screen with a rapidly varying emitting source could be possible. As for the jet, the RM gradient indicates a helical configuration of the magnetic field that persists up to the kiloparsec scale. Combined with the kiloparsec-scale RM measurements at lower frequencies, we found that RM is frequency-dependent in the jet. One possible scenario to explain this dependence is that the kiloparsec-scale jet has a trumpet-like shape, and the jet coil unwinds near its end.

<div> quadruply lensed quasar, rectangular hyperbola, lensing galaxy, perpendicular offset, lens models

总结:
Witt提出了从四重成像的类星体构建矩形双曲线的方法，这种双曲线与镜片星系非常接近。通过对39个由相对孤立星系透镜的系统进行观测，发现观测到的镜头光中心与Witt的双曲线之间的中位垂直偏移为0.″013。Witt采用的透镜模型预测，透镜位于双曲线上，但其位置并未用于构建模型。中位偏移大约相当于爱因斯坦环半径的1%，表明镜片的光中心与透镜潜在中心非常接近。在拟合数据时，通过对Witt的双曲线的垂直距离（或者星系与势能之间的距离）设置严格的先验条件，可以将模型空间的维数减少一个。将透镜星系的最亮像素视为其中心，避免了使用平均光中心进行约束的缺点。 <div>
When a rectangular hyperbola is constructed from the image positions of a quadruply lensed quasar, as proposed by Witt, it passes very close to the lensing galaxy. The median measured perpendicular offset between the observed light center of the lens and Witt’s hyperbola is 0.″013 for a sample for 39 systems lensed by a relatively isolated galaxy. The family of lens models adopted by Witt predicts that the lens lies on the hyperbola, but its position is not used for its construction. The median offset corresponds to roughly 1% of the Einstein ring radius and suggests that the centers of the lensing potential are close to the light centers of the lens. By putting a restrictive prior on the perpendicular distance to Witt’s hyperbola (or on the distance between the galaxy and the potential), one reduces by one the dimensionality of a model space when fitting data. Taking the brightest pixel of a lensing galaxy as its center avoids a shortcoming of using the average light center for a constraint.

分子云形成是通过碰撞诱发磁重联机制实现的，碰撞的两个原子气云触发了磁重联并产生了一个巨大的20光年长的丝状结构。通过辐射传输建模表明，这个丝状结构中间部分含有5光年跨度的密集核心，其中一些核心正在活跃地形成恒星。同时，超音速湍流的存在表明磁重联能够自发产生湍流。最后，形成的螺旋磁场应该从大多数观测角度都呈现出两侧的场反转。这一过程与传统的由上至下的云层层次分析不同，而是通过磁场重新连接将冲击气体凝结并逐段输送到主轴构成丝状结构。 <div>
We have investigated the possibility of molecular cloud formation via the collision-induced magnetic reconnection (CMR) mechanism of the cold neutral medium (CNM). Two atomic gas clouds with conditions typical of the CNM were set to collide at the interface of reverse magnetic fields. The cloud–cloud collision triggered magnetic reconnection and produced a giant 20 pc filamentary structure that was not seen in the control models without CMR. The cloud, with rich fiber-like substructures, developed a fully molecular spine at 5 Myr. Radiative transfer modeling of dust emission at far-infrared wavelengths showed that the middle part of the filament contained dense cores over a span of 5 pc. Some of the cores were actively forming stars and typically exhibited both connecting fibers in dust emission and high-velocity gas in CO line emission, indicative of active accretion through streamers. Supersonic turbulence was present in and around the CMR filament due to inflowing gas moving at supersonic velocities in the collision midplane. The shocked gas was condensed and transported to the main filament piece by piece by reconnected fields, making the filament and star formation a bottom-up process. Instead of forming a gravitationally bounded cloud that then fragments hierarchically (top-down) and forms stars, the CMR process creates dense gas pieces and magnetically transports them to the central axis to constitute the filament. Since no turbulence is manually driven, our results suggest that CMR is capable of self-generating turbulence. Finally, the resulting helical field should show field reversal on both sides of the filament from most viewing angles.

<div> 关键词: 磁流体力学，磁风模型，潮汐撕裂事件，磁致运动，光度曲线
总结:
研究了一维、时间相关的磁致运动盘风模型，应用于潮汐撕裂事件的背景下。通过磁流体力学方程，考虑了磁制动和湍流黏度，得到了满足垂直无界MHD流的风解。模拟结果表明，盘风随着初始高斯密度分布的质量损失和从风和吸积的质量演化。同时发现，在没有风的情况下，质量吸积速率与时间的幂律关系为t^-19/16，但当风存在时，吸积速率下降更快。磁制动也导致了质量吸积速率的加速下降，产生了X射线延迟闪耀现象。模型预测了UV明亮的潮汐撕裂事件在后期的光度曲线将会比t^-19/16更陡峭，这可能是磁致风的有力指标。 <div>
We present a time-dependent, one-dimensional, magnetically driven disk wind model based on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, in the context of tidal disruption events (TDEs). We assume that the disk is geometrically thin, is gas pressure dominated, and explicitly accounts for magnetic braking and turbulent viscosity through an extended α-viscosity prescription. We find a particular wind solution for a set of basic equations that satisfies the necessary and sufficient conditions for vertically unbound MHD flows. The solution shows that the disk evolves with mass loss due to wind and accretion from the initial Gaussian density distribution. We confirm that the mass accretion rate follows the power law of time t−19/16 at late times in the absence of wind, which matches the classical solution of J. K. Cannizzo et al. We find that the mass accretion rate is steeper than the t−19/16 curve when the wind is present. Mass accretion is also induced by magnetic braking, known as the wind-driven accretion mechanism, which results in a faster decay with time of both the mass accretion and mass-loss rates. In the disk emission, the ultraviolet (UV) luminosity is the highest among the optical, UV, and X-ray luminosities. While the optical and X-ray emission is observationally insignificant without magnetic braking, the X-ray emission is brighter at late times, especially in the presence of magnetic braking. This provides a possible explanation for observed delayed X-ray flares. Our model predicts that late-time bolometric light curves steeper than t−19/16 in UV-bright TDEs are potentially compelling indicators of magnetically driven winds.

<div> NGC 1851, LMG, BHs, MSP, Monte Carlo N-body code
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了质量在2-5 M⊙之间的紧凑恒星遗迹的存在。通过NGC 1851星团的模拟，研究了LMG黑洞的形成过程，发现质量巨星演化和动力学相互作用都会对LMG黑洞的形成起到贡献。NGC 1851模型能够复制观测到的MSP-LMG BH双星系统，LMG黑洞还可能成为动力学形成的双星系统的组成部分，并且一些将会在类似于最近发现的引力波源GW230529的BH-NS系统中合并。然而，对应的合并率可能不超过1 Gpc-3 yr-1。 <div>
The existence of compact stellar remnants in the mass range 2–5 M⊙ has long been debated. This so-called lower-mass gap (LMG) was initially suggested by the lack of low-mass X-ray binary observations with accretors about 2–5 M⊙, but it has recently been called into question following newer observations, including an LMG candidate with a millisecond pulsar (MSP) companion in the dense globular cluster NGC 1851. Here, we model NGC 1851 with a grid of similar dense star clusters utilizing the state-of-the-art Monte Carlo N-body code Cluster Monte Carlo, and we specifically study the formation of LMG black holes (BHs). We demonstrate that both massive star evolution and dynamical interactions can contribute to forming LMG BHs. In general, the collapse of massive remnants formed through mergers of neutron stars (NSs) or massive white dwarfs produces the largest number of LMG BHs among all formation channels. However, in more massive clusters, supernova core collapse can contribute comparable numbers. Our NGC 1851-like models can reproduce MSP—LMG BH binaries similar to the observed system. Additionally, the LMG BHs can also become components of dynamically assembled binaries, and some will be in merging BH–NS systems similar to the recently detected gravitational wave source GW230529. However, the corresponding merger rate is probably ≲1 Gpc−3 yr−1.

JWST探测、碳载分子、宜居带次海王星、气态矮星、岩浆海洋

总结: 该文介绍了最近JWST探测到宜居带次海王星中含碳分子的发现，标志着低质量外星行星研究迎来新时代。次海王星群体的内部和大气构成多样，包括迷你海王星、超级地球和水世界。研究表明气态矮星可能具有岩质内部和厚厚的H2大气，与潜在的岩浆海洋相互作用可能导致可观测的大气特征。作者提出了一种内外大气耦合模型框架，用于研究气态矮星上岩浆海洋的可能性和可观测特征。研究发现表面-大气相互作用和大气成分对多种参数敏感，需要综合建模方法来避免不切实际的模型解。通过对宜居带次海王星K2-18 b进行案例研究，得出其观测大气成分与岩浆海洋场景不符，并确定了CO2、CO、NH3等大气分子和元素的关键诊断。研究还强调了准确建模这类外星行星所需的基本物质属性。 <div>
The recent JWST detections of carbon-bearing molecules in a habitable-zone sub-Neptune have opened a new era in the study of low-mass exoplanets. The sub-Neptune regime spans a wide diversity of planetary interiors and atmospheres not witnessed in the solar system, including mini-Neptunes, super-Earths, and water worlds. Recent works have investigated the possibility of gas dwarfs, with rocky interiors and thick H2-rich atmospheres, to explain aspects of the sub-Neptune population, including the radius valley. Interactions between the H2-rich envelope and a potential magma ocean may lead to observable atmospheric signatures. We report a coupled interior-atmosphere modeling framework for gas dwarfs to investigate the plausibility of magma oceans on such planets and their observable diagnostics. We find that the surface–atmosphere interactions and atmospheric composition are sensitive to a wide range of parameters, including the atmospheric and internal structure, mineral composition, volatile solubility and atmospheric chemistry. While magma oceans are typically associated with high-temperature rocky planets, we assess if such conditions may be admissible and observable for temperate sub-Neptunes. We find that a holistic modeling approach is required for this purpose and to avoid unphysical model solutions. Using our model framework, we consider the habitable-zone sub-Neptune K2-18 b as a case study and find that its observed atmospheric composition is incompatible with a magma ocean scenario. We identify key atmospheric molecular and elemental diagnostics, including the abundances of CO2, CO, NH3, and, potentially, S-bearing species. Our study also underscores the need for fundamental material properties for accurate modeling of such planets.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了卫星星系在银河系周围形成薄平面的物理机制。通过使用天体力学模拟，他们确认了大型卫星星系，如大麦哲伦星系，引起外部星系暗物质晕的视觉运动。他们发现所有卫星星系都引起了轨道极点分布的变化，但是质量最大且近日点在30至100kpc之间的卫星星系引起最大变化。最佳的大麦哲伦星系模拟显示了最大的轨道极点分布变化。这些结果表明，在银河系中，大麦哲伦星系的近日点经过应该已经改变了所有其他卫星星系的观测到的轨道极点分布。因此，在寻求将银河系置于宇宙背景下的卫星星系运动的研究中，应考虑到存在大麦哲伦星系这样的大型卫星星系。 <div>
Understanding the physical mechanism behind the formation of a corotating thin plane of satellite galaxies, like the one observed around the Milky Way (MW), has been challenging. The perturbations induced by a massive satellite galaxy, like the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), provide valuable insight into this problem. The LMC induces an apparent corotating motion in the outer halo by displacing the inner regions of the halo with respect to the outer halo. Using the Latte suite of Feedback In Realistic Environments cosmological simulations of MW-mass galaxies, we confirm that the apparent motion of the outer halo induced by the infall of a massive satellite changes the observed distribution of orbital poles of outer-halo tracers, including satellites. We quantify the changes in the distribution of orbital poles using the two-point angular correlation function and find that all satellites induce changes. However, the most massive satellites with pericentric passages between ≈30 and 100 kpc induce the largest changes. The best LMC-like satellite analog shows the largest change in orbital pole distribution. The dispersion of orbital poles decreases by 20° during the first two pericentric passages. Even when excluding the satellites brought in with the LMC-like satellite, there is clustering of orbital poles. These results suggest that in the MW, the recent pericentric passage of the LMC should have changed the observed distribution of orbital poles of all other satellites. Therefore, studies of kinematically coherent planes of satellites that seek to place the MW in a cosmological context should account for the existence of a massive satellite like the LMC.

Cep-Her复杂星团是在500光年范围内最大的星群之一，由Roslund 6、Orpheus、Cinyras和Cupavo等四个组成。其中，Orpheus、Cinyras和Cupavo是年龄在25-80百万年之间的年轻组织，分别包含9552颗±960颗、3872颗±455颗和8794颗±1827颗恒星。研究发现Cinyras组织可能经历了顺序的星形成过程，而Orpheus组织显示出可能存在多个云团形成的证据。另外，动力学模拟表明，尽管一些嵌入式的开放星团和这些组织的中心部分正在趋于聚集，它们可能缺乏足够的质量来吸引彼此并进行分层的簇组装。这些研究结果为将来的星球形成研究提供了复杂星形成环境的新视角。 <br /><br />总结: <br /> Cep-Her Complex 是由四个不同组织构成的复杂星团，包括了年龄较大的Roslund 6以及年轻的Orpheus、Cinyras和Cupavo。这些年轻组织都是体积庞大的星团，在其动力学和年龄上都展现出不同的特点。研究还指出Cinyras组织可能经历了顺序的星形成过程，而Orpheus组织显示出可能存在多个云团形成的证据。同时，动力学模拟结果表明这些组织可能不具备进行分层聚集的质量，这为未来的星球形成研究提供了重要的参考。 <div>
Young associations record complete histories of star-forming events through their demographics and dynamics, and Gaia has greatly expanded our knowledge of these associations. We present the first structural and dynamical overview study of the Cep-Her Complex, which has recently emerged as the largest stellar population within 500 pc that still lacks substantial follow-up. We reveal that Cep-Her is not a singular association, but rather an amalgam of four, consisting of the older (τ > 100 Myr) open cluster Roslund 6, in addition to three dynamically coherent and highly substructured young associations that we focus on: Orpheus (25–40 Myr), Cinyras (28–43 Myr), and Cupavo (54–80 Myr). With 9552 ± 960 stars in Orpheus, 3872 ± 455 stars in Cinyras, and 8794 ± 1827 stars in Cupavo, all three are among the largest young associations within 500 pc, rivalling major associations like Sco-Cen. Our novel view of the ages and dynamics of these associations reveals evidence for sequential star formation in Cinyras, in addition to a multiorigin pattern of stellar dispersal in Orpheus that may hint to the presence of multiple clouds at formation. Dynamical simulations indicate that, while some embedded open clusters and central components of these associations are converging, they likely lack the mass necessary to capture one another and undergo hierarchical cluster assembly. Our results provide our first view of the complex star-forming environments that gave rise to the associations of Cep-Her, which will serve as important laboratories for future studies of star and planet formation.

总结:
Hinode-SOT/SP和光谱线反演技术观察到了太阳光球中的颗粒逐渐消失的过程，并且在MURaM模拟中复现了这一现象。研究发现，小尺度的湍流运动在颗粒消失过程中被激发，并且这种湍流流动导致了光谱线的宽ening。因此，光谱线宽度可以成为太阳光球湍流流动的潜在追踪器。 <div>
In the quiet region of the solar photosphere, turbulent convective motions of the granular flows naturally drive the subgranular-scale flows. However, evaluating such small-scale velocities is challenging because of the limited instrumental resolution. Our previous study, R. T. Ishikawa et al., found line-broadening events during the fading process of granules; however, their physical mechanism has remained unclear. In the present study, we observed the fading granules with the Hinode-SOT/SP and performed spectral line inversions. Moreover, we investigated the broadening events of synthesized spectra in fading granules reproduced by the MURaM simulation. Our results demonstrated that the small-scale turbulent motions are excited in the fading process, and such turbulent flows contribute to line broadening. The spectral line widths can be potential tracers of the photospheric turbulent flows.

We present high-resolution simulations of high velocity clouds (HVCs) colliding with the outer part of the Galactic disk. All of the simulations include a 3 × 108M⊙ dark matter subhalo. Three simulations model a dark matter subhalo without a gaseous component, while eight simulations model a dark matter subhalo accompanied by a gaseous cloud of mass 2–8 × 106M⊙. Half of the simulations include the coherent component of the Galaxy's magnetic field. Each simulation spans ∼40 million years before the collision and ∼40 million years after the collision. The collisions between the gas cloud and disk splash gas into the halo, punch half-kiloparsec-size holes in the disk, and form long-lived, multi-kiloparsec-size shells. Each shell encloses a bubble of relatively cool gas. Holes and shells of these scales would be observable, and some have been observed in the past. We determine the fate of the HVC gas, temperature, composition, and ionization state of the bubble and shell gas, size and longevity of the holes, and effects of cloud density. Simulations show that the clouds do not survive the chaos of passage through the disk, but instead become part of the splash, bubble, and shell. Some dark matter clouds may appear to carry material with them long after the collision, but this material is shell gas that was captured by the dark matter subhalo. These results have ramifications for the Smith Cloud and other clouds hypothesized to have hit the Galactic disk.

The structure of the low redshift Universe is dominated by a multiscale void distribution delineated by filaments and walls of galaxies. The characteristics of voids, such as morphology, average density profile, and correlation function, can be used as cosmological probes. However, their physical properties are difficult to infer due to shot noise and the general lack of tracer particles used to define them. In this work, we construct a robust, topology-based void-finding algorithm that utilizes Persistent Homology to detect persistent features in the data. We apply this approach to a volume-limited subsample of galaxies in the SDSS I/II Main Galaxy catalog with the r-band absolute magnitude brighter than Mr = −20.19, and a set of mock catalogs constructed using the Horizon Run 4 cosmological N-body simulation. We measure the size distribution of voids, their averaged radial profile, sphericity, and the centroid nearest neighbor separation, using conservative values for the threshold and persistence. We find 32 topologically robust voids in the SDSS data over the redshift range 0.02 ≤ z ≤ 0.116, with effective radii in the range 21−56 h−1 Mpc. The median nearest neighbor void separation is found to be ∼57 h−1 Mpc, and the median radial void profile is consistent with the expected shape from the mock data.

We report new theories and simulations for electron acceleration in magnetic islands generated by magnetic reconnection in the shock turbulence in a quasi-parallel shock, using a 2 and 1/2 dimensional particle-in-cell simulation. When an island is moving, unmagnetized electrons are accelerated by the Hall electric field pointing toward the island center. In a stationary island, some electrons are energized by “island betatron acceleration” due to the induction electric field when the island core magnetic field changes with time. In the simulation, almost all of the high-energy electrons in the shock transition region that show a power-law distribution are accelerated in ion-skin-depth-scale magnetic flux ropes, and about half of them are accelerated by the Hall electric field and island betatron acceleration. These mechanisms can produce a power-law electron distribution, and also inject electrons into the diffusive shock acceleration. The mechanisms are applicable to quasi-parallel shocks with high Alfvén Mach numbers (MA > 10), including planetary bow shocks and shocks in astrophysical objects such as supernova remnants.

EX Draconis is an eclipsing dwarf nova that shows outbursts with moderate amplitude (≃2 mag) and a recurrence timescale of ≃20–30 days. Dwarf novae outbursts are explained in terms of either a thermal-viscous instability in the disc or an instability in the mass-transfer rate of the donor star (MTIM). We developed simulations of the response of accretion discs to events of enhanced mass transfer, in the context of the MTIM, and applied them to model the light curve and variations in the radius of the EX Dra disc throughout the outburst. We obtain the first modeling of a dwarf nova outburst by using χ2 to select, from a grid of simulations, the best-fit parameters to the observed EX Dra outbursts. The observed time evolution of the system brightness and the changes in the radius of the outer disc along the outburst cycle are satisfactorily reproduced by a model of the response of an accretion disc with a viscosity parameter α = 4.0 and a quiescent mass-transfer rate g s−1 to an event of width Δt = 6.0 × 105 s (∼7 days) where the mass-transfer rate increases to g s−1.

总结:
本研究利用绿岭天文台的中性氢（H i）跟踪调查了378个光学探测到的超弱扩散星系（UDG）候选星系，其中110个目标检测到了H i。根据有效半径和中心表面亮度，我们确定了37个为UDGs，73个为低表面亮度(LSB)矮星系。与先前的研究一致，我们发现H i检测平均具有较蓝的g − r颜色和更不规则的形态，占据了ALFALFA星系表的星形主序的尾端，具有略低的特定星形成率。我们还发现H i检测主要在相对孤立（即，场）环境中，而大多数未检测到的在投影中至少有一个附近邻居。我们发现H i质量与恒星质量比（即，气体丰富度）与UDGs和LSB矮星系的物理尺寸成比例，这表明除了间歇性星形成反馈之外可能存在其他机制。然而，如果我们使用有效表面亮度而不是中心表面亮度来定义UDGs，则气体丰富度与物理尺寸之间存在更强的趋势。我们正在利用这个前所未有的UDG候选样本进行详细的后续研究（例如，星形成和环境分析，与模拟的比较），并且正在为其中的一些进行了解析的H i观测。 <div>
We present the results from the neutral hydrogen (H i) follow-up survey of 378 optically detected ultradiffuse galaxy (UDG) candidates from the Systematically Measuring Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies survey using the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope. We detect H i in 110 targets and determine 37 to be UDGs and 73 to be low-surface-brightness (LSB) dwarfs based on their effective radii and central surface brightnesses. In line with previous studies, we find that: (i) our H i detections have on average bluer g − r colors and more irregular morphologies than our H i nondetections, (ii) our H i detections populate the tail end of the star-forming main sequence from the ALFALFA catalog with marginally lower specific star formation rates, and (iii) H i detections are mostly in relatively isolated (i.e., field) environments, while most nondetections have at least one nearby neighbor in projection. We find that the H i mass to stellar mass ratios (i.e., gas richnesses) scale with the physical sizes for UDGs and LSB dwarfs alike, suggesting that mechanisms other than bursty star formation feedback may be at play for UDGs. However, we find a stronger trend between gas richnesses and physical sizes if we define UDGs using their effective surface brightness instead of their central surface brightness. We are in the process of using this unprecedented sample of UDG candidates to carry out detailed follow-up studies (i.e., star formation and environmental analysis, comparisons to simulations) and are obtaining resolved H i observations for several of them.

总结:<br /><br />本文研究了旋转不稳定小行星形成的碎片云的累积演化。通过半解析模型和大规模离散元法模拟，发现碎片云的形成受大颗粒的支配，而且碎片遗留在小行星周围的机械环境中会发生聚集现象。此外，研究还分析了碰撞对碎片的影响，并指出了缓冲的蓬松结构在释放后会迅速形成。这些结构具有一定的强度，能够吸收碰撞并吸收碰撞产生的碎片。通过模拟研究，得到的结果与观测和小行星任务估计的物理参数一致，证实了该模型的可靠性。 <div>
The rotational mass loss has been realized to be a prevalent mechanism to produce low-speed debris near the asteroid, and the size composition of the asteroid’s surface regolith has been closely measured by in situ explorations. However, the full-scale evolution of the shedding debris has not been examined using the observed particle sizes, which may hold vital clues to the initial growth of an asteroid moonlet and help us to understand the general mechanisms that dominate the formation of asteroid systems. This paper presents our study on the cumulative evolution of the debris cloud formed by a rotationally unstable asteroid. A semianalytical model is developed to characterize the spatiotemporal evolution of the debris cloud posterior to a shedding event. Large-scale discrete element method (DEM) simulations are performed to quantify the clustering behavior of the debris particles in the mechanical environment near the asteroid. As a result, we found that the cumulation of a steady debris cloud is dominated by large pieces of debris, and the shedding particles follow a common migration trend, which fundamentally determines the mass distribution of the debris cloud. For the accretion analysis, we sketched the life cycle of a debris cluster and showed its dependency on particle size. The DEM simulations adopt physical parameters estimated from observations and asteroid missions. The results confirm that porous fluffy cluster structures can form shortly after a shedding event with magnitudes the same as the observed shedding activities. Measurements of these structures show that they themselves possess a certain strength and have the capacity to collisions to absorb dissociative particles that collide with them.

<title>A Comprehensive Study of Open Cluster Chemical Homogeneity Using APOGEE and Milky Way Mapper Abundances</title>

Stars in an open cluster are assumed to have formed from a broadly homogeneous distribution of gas, implying that they should be chemically homogeneous. Quantifying the level to which open clusters are chemically homogeneous can therefore tell us about interstellar medium pollution and gas mixing in progenitor molecular clouds. Using Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-V Milky Way Mapper and SDSS-IV Apache Point Observatory Galaxy Evolution Experiment DR17 abundances, we test this assumption by quantifying intrinsic chemical scatter in up to 20 different chemical abundances across 26 Milky Way open clusters. We find that we can place 3σ upper limits on open cluster homogeneity within 0.02 dex or less in the majority of elements, while for neutron capture elements, as well as those elements having weak lines, we place limits on their homogeneity within 0.2 dex. Finally, we find that giant stars in open clusters are ∼0.01 dex more homogeneous than a matched sample of field stars.

<title>JWST View of Four Infant Galaxies at z = 8.31–8.49 in the MACS J0416.1−2403 Field and Implications for Reionization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
New JWST/NIRCam wide-field slitless spectroscopy provides redshifts for four z > 8 galaxies located behind the lensing cluster MACS J0416.1−2403. Two of them, “Y1” and “JD,” have previously reported spectroscopic redshifts based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array measurements of [O iii] 88 μm and/or [C ii] 157.7 μm lines. Y1 is a merging system of three components, and the existing redshift z = 8.31 is confirmed. However, JD is at z = 8.34 instead of the previously claimed z = 9.28. JD’s close companion, “JD-N,” which was a previously discovered z > 8 candidate, is now identified at the same redshift as JD. JD and JD-N form an interacting pair. A new candidate at z > 8, “f090d_018,” is also confirmed and is at z = 8.49. These four objects are likely part of an overdensity that signposts a large structure extending ∼165 kpc in projected distance and ∼48.7 Mpc in radial distance. They are magnified by less than 1 mag and have an intrinsic MUV ranging from −19.57 to −20.83 mag. Their spectral energy distributions show that the galaxies are all very young with ages ∼ 4–18 Myr and stellar masses of about 107–8M⊙. These infant galaxies have very different star formation rates ranging from a few to over a hundred solar masses per year, but only two of them (JD and f090d_018) have blue rest-frame UV slopes β < −2.0 indicative of a high Lyman-continuum photon escape fraction that could contribute significantly to the cosmic hydrogen-reionizing background. Interestingly, these two galaxies are the least massive and least active ones among the four. The other two systems have much flatter UV slopes largely because of their high dust extinction (AV = 0.9–1.0 mag). Their much lower indicated escape fractions show that even very young, actively star-forming galaxies can have a negligible contribution to reionization when they quickly form dust throughout their bodies.

这篇文章报告了2022年11月9日至11月15日之间观测到的一系列太阳能电子（SEE）事件。在此期间，Solar Orbiter、STEREO-A和近地球的航天器观测到了至少32次能量大于10keV的SEE强度增强现象，其中13次发生在11月11日。这些事件中的一些伴随着小于10MeV的质子和小于2MeV的重离子强度增强。通过结合来自三个观测点的遥感和原位数据，研究人员确定了这一系列事件的起源是在两个活跃区附近的极端紫外观测中探测到的一系列明亮现象和喷射。研究人员还发现硬X射线耀斑、III型射电爆发与SEE的释放之间存在密切关联。另外，11月9日和14日观测到的两次特殊的SEE事件，主要是在电子能量小于50keV但富含小于1MeV的重离子，这些事件的起源是不明确的慢上升EUV排放。 <br /><br />总结: 这篇文章总结了2022年11月9日至11月15日期间观测到的一系列太阳能电子（SEE）事件。观测结果显示，这些事件与活跃区附近的极端紫外观测中探测到的一系列明亮现象和喷射有关，同时伴随着硬X射线耀斑和III型射电爆发。此外，也观测到了两次特殊的SEE事件，但其起源仍不明确。 <div>
A series of solar energetic electron (SEE) events was observed from 2022 November 9 to November 15 by Solar Orbiter, STEREO-A, and near-Earth spacecraft. At least 32 SEE intensity enhancements at energies >10 keV were clearly distinguishable in Solar Orbiter particle data, with 13 of them occurring on November 11. Several of these events were accompanied by ≲10 MeV proton and ≲2 MeV nucleon−1 heavy-ion intensity enhancements. By combining remote-sensing and in situ data from the three viewpoints (Solar Orbiter and STEREO-A were ∼20° and ∼15° east of Earth, respectively), we determine that the origin of this rapid succession of events was a series of brightenings and jetlike eruptions detected in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations from the vicinity of two active regions. We find a close association between these EUV phenomena, the occurrence of hard X-ray flares, type III radio bursts, and the release of SEEs. For the most intense events, usually associated with extended EUV jets, the distance between the site of these solar eruptions and the estimated magnetic connectivity regions of each spacecraft with the Sun did not prevent the arrival of electrons at the three locations. The capability of jets to drive coronal fronts does not necessarily imply the observation of an SEE event. Two peculiar SEE events on November 9 and 14, observed only at electron energies ≲50 keV but rich in ≲1 MeV nucleon−1 heavy ions, originated from slow-rising confined EUV emissions, for which the process resulting in energetic particle release to interplanetary space is unclear.

Blue horizontal branch stars (BHBs), excellent distant tracers for probing the Milky Way’s halo density profile, are distinguished in the versus (i − z)0 color space from another class of stars, blue straggler stars. We develop a Bayesian mixture model to classify BHBs using high-precision photometry data from the Dark Energy Survey Data Release 2 (DES DR2). We select ∼2100 highly probable BHBs based on their griz photometry and the associated uncertainties, and we use these stars to map the stellar halo over the Galactocentric radial range 20 kpc ≲ R ≲ 70 kpc. After excluding known stellar overdensities, we find that the number density n⋆ of BHBs can be represented by a power-law density profile n⋆ ∝ R−α with an index of , consistent with existing literature values. In addition, we examine the impact of systematic errors and the spatial inhomogeneity on the fitted density profile. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of high-precision griz photometry in selecting BHBs. The upcoming photometric survey from the Rubin Observatory, expected to reach depths 2–3 mag greater than DES during its 10 yr mission, will enable us to investigate the density profile of the Milky Way’s halo out to the virial radius, unraveling the complex processes of formation and evolution in our Galaxy.

本文提出了一种从James Webb Space Telescope观测的引力透镜聚类图像中建立和去除聚类星系和星系团内光（ICL）的方法论。研究者们在SMACS 0723 Early Release Observations中应用这一方法，并利用去除了ICL的图像选择了一组星团和矮星系。他们比较了这两个样本的空间分布与他们所建立的星系和ICL光模型，发现了显著的相似之处。特别是，他们发现星团追踪着弥散的ICL，而矮星系集中在聚类中心附近。研究者们量化了紧凑源的表面密度与总聚类光之间的关系，并展示了显著的紧密相关性。他们重复了他们的方法，将星团的分布与暗物质表面密度进行了比较，得到了类似的结果。研究结果表明星团和弥散的ICL可能具有共同的起源，大质量星系与聚类合并时的剥离可能是一个合理的情景。 <div>
We present a methodology for modeling and removing light from cluster galaxies and intracluster light (ICL) from James Webb Space Telescope images of gravitational lensing clusters. We apply our method to Webb’s First Deep Field the SMACS 0723 Early Release Observations and use the ICL-subtracted images to select a sample of globular clusters (GCs) and dwarf galaxies within the cluster. We compare the spatial distributions of these two samples with our models of the galaxy and ICL light, finding significant similarities. In particular, we find that GCs trace the diffuse ICL, while dwarf galaxies are centrally concentrated near the cluster center We quantify the relationship between the surface density of compact sources and total cluster light, demonstrating a significant, tight correlation. We repeat our methodology and compare distributions of GCs with the dark matter surface density and find a comparable result. Our findings suggest a common origin for GCs and diffuse ICL, with stripping from massive galaxies as they merge with the cluster being a plausible scenario.

We report 10 fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected in the far sidelobe region (i.e., ≥5° off-meridian) of the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) from August 28 2018 to August 31 2021. We localize the bursts by fitting their spectra with a model of the CHIME/FRB synthesized beam response. We find that the far sidelobe events have on average ∼500 times greater fluxes than events detected in CHIME’s main lobe. We show that the sidelobe sample is therefore statistically ∼20 times closer than the main lobe sample. We find promising host galaxy candidates (Pcc < 1%) for two of the FRBs, 20190112B and 20210310B, at distances of 38 and 16 Mpc, respectively. CHIME/FRB did not observe repetition of similar brightness from the uniform sample of 10 sidelobe FRBs in a total exposure time of 35,580 hr. Under the assumption of Poisson-distributed bursts, we infer that the mean repetition interval above the detection threshold of the far sidelobe events is longer than 11,880 hr, which is at least 2380 times larger than the interval from known CHIME/FRB detected repeating sources, with some caveats, notably that very narrowband events could have been missed. Our results from these far sidelobe events suggest one of two scenarios: either (1) all FRBs repeat and the repetition intervals span a wide range, with high-rate repeaters being a rare sub-population, or (2) non-repeating FRBs are a distinct population different from known repeaters.

总结:
这篇文章报告了对位于背景类星体FBQS J0209–0438的多相Lyman limit系统(LLS)的分析。文章发现，与这个吸收体相关的O VI双线与低电离金属和H i的谱线具有不同的轮廓。Ly α具有一个与O VI成分非常一致的非常宽的H i成分(b ≈ 150 km s−1)。宽H i和O VI的多普勒b参数表明这些气体的温度约为(0.8 − 2.0) × 10^6 K，并且氢柱密度是负责LLS的冷相气体的一个数量级大。Very Large Telescope MUSE的观测显示，在吸收体附近的约105千秒差距内存在两个中等星形成率的星系，其中一个是一个侏儒星系(M* ≈ 10^6M⊙)，与类星体点扩散函数重叠，另一个是一个较大的星系(R1/2 ≈ 4 kpc) ，具有M* ≈ 3 × 10^10M⊙和Mh ≈ 7 × 10^11M⊙，并且侏儒星系位于其温度半径内。尽管吸收与较大星系的扩展主轴对齐，但吸收气体的视向速度与共转吸积不一致。LLS的金属丰度低于两个星系的气态[O/H]。吸收气体中涉及冷和温/热的气体相，并且它在星系对的联合暗物质环境中的接近和取向，表明LLS是两个星系的联合暗物质环境中的高速气体。 <div>
We report on the analysis of a multiphase Lyman limit system (LLS) at z = 0.39047 identified toward the background quasar FBQS J0209–0438. The O VI doublet lines associated with this absorber have a different profile from the low-ionization metals and H i. Ly α has a very broad H i (b ≈ 150 km s−1) component well-aligned with one of the O VI components. The Doppler b-parameters for the broad H i and O VI indicate gas with T = (0.8 − 2.0) × 106 K and a total hydrogen column density that is an order of magnitude larger than the cooler phase of gas responsible for the LLS. Observations by the Very Large Telescope MUSE show two moderately star-forming galaxies within ρ ≲ 105 kpc and ∣Δv∣ ≲ 130 km s−1 of the absorber, one of them a dwarf galaxy (M* ≈ 106M⊙) overlapping with the quasar point-spread function, and the other a larger galaxy (R1/2 ≈ 4 kpc) with M* ≈ 3 × 1010M⊙ and Mh ≈ 7 × 1011M⊙, and the dwarf galaxy within its virial radius. Although the absorption is aligned with the extended major axis of the larger galaxy, the line-of-sight velocity of the absorbing gas is inconsistent with corotating accretion. The metallicity inferred for the LLS is lower than the gas phase [O/H] of the two galaxies. The mixture of cool and warm/hot gas phases for the absorbing gas and its proximity and orientation to the galaxy pair points to the LLS being a high-velocity gas in the combined halo environment of both galaxies.

Stable isotopic ratios constitute powerful tools for unraveling the thermal and irradiation history of volatiles. In particular, we can use our knowledge of the isotopic fractionation processes active during the various stages of star, disk, and planet formation to infer the origins of different volatiles with measured isotopic patterns in our own solar system. Observations of planet-forming disks with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) now readily detect the heavier isotopologues of C, O, and N, while the isotopologue abundances and isotopic fractionation mechanisms of sulfur species are less well understood. Using ALMA observations of the SO and SO2 isotopologues in the nearby, molecule-rich disk around the young star Oph-IRS 48 we present the first constraints on the combined 32S/34S and 32S/33S isotope ratios in a planet-forming disk. Given that these isotopologues likely originate in relatively warm gas (>50 K), like most other Oph-IRS 48 volatiles, SO is depleted in heavy sulfur, while SO2 is enriched compared to solar system values. However, we cannot completely rule out a cooler gas reservoir, which would put the SO sulfur ratios more in line with comets and other solar system bodies. We also constrain the S18O/SO ratio and find the limit to be consistent with solar system values given a temperature of 60 K. Together these observations show that we should not assume solar isotopic values for disk sulfur reservoirs, but additional observations are needed to determine the chemical origin of the abundant SO in this disk, inform on what isotopic fractionation mechanism(s) are at play, and aid in unraveling the history of the sulfur budget during the different stages of planet formation.

<div> AstroSat, NGC 4151, multiwavelength spectral study, X-ray absorption, intrinsic reddening<br />
<br />总结:<br />本文通过对NGC 4151进行的五次AstroSat观测，对其多波段光谱进行了研究。通过对内部和银河消光、广线区和窄线区的贡献以及宿主星系的发射进行校正，得出了固有的吸积盘连续谱。研究发现，在更亮的紫外光通量下，连续谱较蓝，可能是由于吸积盘连续谱或紫外线红移的变化。利用2000年3月获得的高分辨率哈勃空间望远镜（HST）/ STIS光谱，估计出固有红化为E（B − V）∼0.4。利用热康普顿散射、中性和电离吸收以及X射线反射来模拟X射线光谱。发现X射线吸收的中性柱变化在NH∼1.2和3.4×1023 cm−2之间，比通过假设银河尘埃与气体比值估算的UV消光大约100倍。为了解释这一差异，提出了两种可能的模型：（a）由不含尘域和含尘域组成的双区域遮挡器，通过升华半径分隔；或（b）由密集云团嵌入低密度介质的双相遮挡器，使得少数密集云团大幅度地遮挡致密的X射线光源，而大部分紫外发射来自于通过低密度介质的扩展吸积盘。此外，发现X射线吸收柱与NUV−远紫外颜色和紫外光通量呈正相关，表明可能受到由"更亮时更蓝"紫外连续谱驱动的增强风的影响。 <div>
We present a multiwavelength spectral study of NGC 4151 based on five epochs of simultaneous AstroSat observations in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) to hard X-ray band (∼0.005–80 keV) during 2017–2018. We derived the intrinsic accretion disk continuum after correcting for internal and Galactic extinction, contributions from broad- and narrow-line regions, and emission from the host galaxy. We found a bluer continuum at brighter UV flux, possibly due to variations in the accretion disk continuum or the UV reddening. We estimated the intrinsic reddening, E(B − V) ∼ 0.4, using high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/STIS spectrum acquired in 2000 March. We used thermal Comptonization, neutral and ionized absorption, and X-ray reflection to model the X-ray spectra. We obtained the X-ray absorbing neutral column varying between NH ∼1.2 and 3.4 × 1023 cm−2, which are ∼100 times larger than that estimated from UV extinction, assuming the Galactic dust-to-gas ratio. To reconcile this discrepancy, we propose two plausible configurations of the obscurer: (a) a two-zone obscurer consisting of dust-free and dusty regions, divided by the sublimation radius, or (b) a two-phase obscurer consisting of clumpy, dense clouds embedded in a low-density medium, resulting in a scenario where a few dense clouds obscure the compact X-ray source substantially, while the bulk of UV emission arising from the extended accretion disk passes through the low-density medium. Furthermore, we find a positive correlation between the X-ray absorption column and NUV − far-UV color and UV flux, indicative of enhanced winds possibly driven by the “bluer-when-brighter” UV continuum.

Our prior studies have revealed two distinct global wave modes for circumplanetary disks with BLs exhibiting opposite behaviors in spin modulation. We perform a detailed analysis of the effects of magnetic fields on these global modes, highlighting how magnetic resonances and turning points could complicate the wave dynamics. The angular momentum flux becomes positive near the BL with increasing magnetic field strength. We also examine the perturbation profile to demonstrate the amplification of magnetic fields within the BL. The dependence of growth rates on the magnetic field strength and the spin rate are systematically investigated. We find that stronger magnetic fields tend to result in lower terminal spin rates. We stress the potential possibility of the formation of angular momentum belts and pressure bumps. The implications for the spin evolution and quasiperiodic oscillations observed in compact objects are also briefly discussed. Our calculations advance the understanding of magnetohydrodynamical accretion processes and lay a foundation for observational studies and numerical simulations.

<div> Dark Energy Survey supernova program, SNe Ia, Hubble diagram, cosmological parameters, photometric classification
<br />
这篇文章介绍了来自Dark Energy Survey超新星项目的光度分类SNe Ia的完整哈勃图。该项目发现了超过20,000个超新星候选，并获得了7000个宿主星系的光谱红移。在光度曲线质量的基础上，选择了1635个光度识别的SNe Ia，其光谱红移为0.10 < z < 1.13，这是任何单个调查中已知的z > 0.5超新星数量增加了5倍。在另一篇论文中，提出了DES-SN样本的宇宙学结果，结合了低红移处的194个光谱分类的SNe Ia作为宇宙学拟合的锚定点。在本文中，我们对这个联合样本进行了广泛的建模，并验证了用于推导距离的整个分析流程。我们展示了在平坦ΛCDM模型中宇宙学参数的统计和系统误差为0.017，在平坦wCDM模型中为= (0.082, 0.152)。将DES SN数据与Planck协作组的高度互补的宇宙微波背景测量相结合，能够将宇宙学参数的不确定性减小4倍。在所有情况下，统计不确定性都大于系统误差。我们还表明，由于光度分类引起的不确定性仅占总系统误差预算的不到10%。这一结果为Vera C. Rubin天文台的“空间与时间的遗产调查”等下一代SN宇宙学调查奠定了基础。<br /><br />总结: 该文章介绍了Dark Energy Survey超新星项目对SNe Ia的研究成果，包括光度分类、哈勃图和宇宙学参数的模拟及验证，展示了合作研究对宇宙学参数不确定性的减小以及未来SN宇宙学调查的重要性。 <div>
We present the full Hubble diagram of photometrically classified Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Dark Energy Survey supernova program (DES-SN). DES-SN discovered more than 20,000 SN candidates and obtained spectroscopic redshifts of 7000 host galaxies. Based on the light-curve quality, we select 1635 photometrically identified SNe Ia with spectroscopic redshift 0.10 < z < 1.13, which is the largest sample of supernovae from any single survey and increases the number of known z > 0.5 supernovae by a factor of 5. In a companion paper, we present cosmological results of the DES-SN sample combined with 194 spectroscopically classified SNe Ia at low redshift as an anchor for cosmological fits. Here we present extensive modeling of this combined sample and validate the entire analysis pipeline used to derive distances. We show that the statistical and systematic uncertainties on cosmological parameters are 0.017 in a flat ΛCDM model, and = (0.082, 0.152) in a flat wCDM model. Combining the DES SN data with the highly complementary cosmic microwave background measurements by Planck Collaboration reduces by a factor of 4 uncertainties on cosmological parameters. In all cases, statistical uncertainties dominate over systematics. We show that uncertainties due to photometric classification make up less than 10% of the total systematic uncertainty budget. This result sets the stage for the next generation of SN cosmology surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time.

<div> 高红移、太空望远镜、星系、宇宙环境、暴星形成<br />
<br />总结:
本研究利用JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES)的观测数据，通过MIRI和NIRCam成像筛选出了高红移的静止星系和暴星形成星系。研究发现，利用MIRI 7.7um成像可以在3 < z < 6的范围内鉴定出23个UVJ颜色空间中的静止演化星系，以及12个低质量的暴星形成星系。这些星系的环境分析也表明，低质量的暴星形成星系更偏向于出现在高密度的环境中。具体而言，研究发现了位于z约3.7的一个过密区域，其中有7个低质量的暴星形成星系。此外，还发现了一个群集中心包含一颗质量巨大的静态星系和一颗有明显残余尘埃成分的星系，这表明星系的环境对其演化有重要影响。 <div>
We present the robust selection of high-redshift quiescent galaxies (QG) and poststarburst (PSB) galaxies using ultra-deep NIRCam and MIRI imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). At 3 < z < 6, MIRI 7.7 μm imaging provides rest-frame J band, which is commonly used to break the degeneracy between old stellar populations and dust attenuation at lower redshifts. We identify 23 passively evolving galaxies in UVJ color space in a mass-limited (log M⋆/M⊙ ≥ 8.5) sample over 8.8 arcmin2. An evaluation of the contribution of the 7.7 μm shows that JADES-like NIRCam coverage (9+ photometric bands) can compensate for lacking the J band at these redshifts; however, more limited three-band selections perform better with MIRI. Our sample is characterized by rapid quenching timescales (∼100–600 Myr) with formation redshifts zf ≲ 9 and includes a potential record-holding massive QG at and two QGs with evidence for significant residual dust content (AV ∼ 1–2). In addition, we present a large sample of 12 log M⋆/M⊙ = 8.5–9.5 PSBs, demonstrating that UVJ selection can be extended to low mass. An analysis of the environment of our sample reveals that the group known as the Cosmic Rose contains a massive QG and a dust-obscured star-forming galaxy (a so-called Jekyll and Hyde pair) plus three additional QGs within ∼20 kpc. Moreover, the Cosmic Rose is part of a larger overdensity at z ∼ 3.7, which contains 7/12 of our low-mass PSBs. Another four low-mass PSBs are members of an overdensity at z ∼ 3.4; this result strongly indicates low-mass PSBs are preferentially associated with overdense environments at z > 3.

总结:<br />
本文介绍了JWST上的中红外仪器MIRI以及其在天文调查中的重要性。MIRI的光谱能力得到了扩展，使得对调查结果的详细解释成为可能。SMILES的设计旨在充分利用MIRI的这一能力。文章对红外调查的历史进行了简要描述，并说明了观测结果在各种科学项目中的用途，最后强调了JWST/MIRI需要进行更多全波段调查的必要性。 <div>
The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) for JWST is supplied with a suite of imaging band-pass filters optimized for full spectral coverage in eight intermediate-width bands from 5 to 26 μm and a narrower one at 11.3 μm. This contrasts with previous infrared space telescopes, which generally have provided only two broad bands, one near 10 μm and the other near 20 μm. The expanded MIRI spectral capability provides new possibilities for detailed interpretation of survey results. This is an important feature of the instrument, on top of its great increase in sensitivity and angular resolution over any previous mission. The Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES) was designed to take full advantage of this capability. This paper briefly describes the history of infrared surveys that paved the way for MIRI on JWST and for our approach to designing SMILES. It illustrates the use of the observations for a broad range of science programs and concludes with a brief summary of the need for additional full multiband surveys with JWST/MIRI. This paper is an overall introduction to the survey and is accompanied by a full data release, described in detail by S. Alberts et al.

Ion acoustic waves are pervasive at the Earth’s bow shock and in regions of active plasmas. Recently, frequency-dispersed ion acoustic-like waves have been observed by Parker Solar Probe in the near-Sun solar wind. These waves are electrostatic, propagate nearly along the magnetic field, and have frequencies on the order of the ion plasma frequency. Frequency-dispersed emissions appear in short (<1 s) bursts and exhibit rising and/or falling tones. This article has a narrow focus, to determine if impulsively accelerated ions are a plausible generation mechanism. We show that velocity dispersion from impulsively accelerated ions can generate a positive slope in the ion distribution that changes in space and time, which can lead to emissions with rising or falling tones given a substantial Doppler shift from the solar wind. The phase velocity is at the velocity of the positive slope, which can differ from the ion acoustic speed, but otherwise these waves are similar to ion acoustic waves. Wave growth is strongest when the positive slope velocity is near the ion acoustic speed. Two mechanisms for impulsive ion acceleration are explored. One mechanism imparts equal energy into the source ions as expected from a parallel potential. The other mechanism imparts equal velocity into the source ions such as that expected from impulsive magnetic reconnection. Both mechanisms result in similar wave characteristics with only subtle differences. Given the persistent appearance of these ion acoustic-like waves, these results suggest that impulsively accelerated ions may be abundant in the near-Sun solar wind.

总结: 本文介绍了天体物理透镜效应的研究，重点在于波动光学效应对相干光源的重要性，并提出了“透镜点扩散函数”（LPSF）的概念，用以描述频率相关的光源通量密度分布。LPSF涵盖了从高频离散几何图像到低频平滑分布的变化过程，是有限频率下透镜图像概念的推广。同时，文章确定了具有非平凡波动效应的频率范围，并指出观测该效应需要非常接近的透镜或非常大的观测波长。最后，文章提到了潜在的观测可能性，包括引力波的透镜效应、银河脉冲星的等离子体透镜效应以及太阳引力透镜效应。 <br /><br /> <div>
Most research on astrophysical lensing has been conducted using the geometric optics framework, where there exists a clear concept of lensing images. However, wave optics effects can be important for coherent sources, e.g., pulsars, fast radio bursts, and gravitational waves observed at long wavelengths. There, the concept of lensing images needs an extension. We introduce the concept of the “lensing point-spread function” (LPSF), the smoothed flux density distribution of a coherent point source after being lensed, as a generalization of the lensing image concept at finite frequencies. The frequency-dependent LPSF captures the gradual change of the flux density distribution of the source from discrete geometric images at high frequencies to a smooth distribution at low frequencies. It complements other generalizations of lensing images, notably the imaginary images and the Lefschetz thimbles. Being a footprint of a lensing system, the LPSF is useful for theoretical studies of lensing. Using the LPSF, we identify a frequency range with nontrivial wave effects, where both geometric optics and perturbative wave optics fail, and determine this range to be ∣κ∣−1 ≲ ν ≲ 10, with κ and ν being the dimensionless lens amplitude and the reduced observing frequency, respectively. Observation of LPSFs with nontrivial wave effects requires either very close-by lenses or very large observing wavelengths. The potential possibilities are the lensing of gravitational waves, the plasma lensing of Milky Way pulsars, and lensing by the solar gravitational lens.

中红外水汽发射光谱为表征行星形成盘向内部(<5 au)递送冰冷卵石提供了一种新的方法。最近，JWST MIRI-MRS显示，紧凑盘相对于多重间隔盘具有低能水蒸气发射的过量，这表明在前者中冰冷卵石的漂移更为高效。我们进行了详细的发射线建模来获取JWST 碎片红外光谱化学调查中四个紧凑盘和三个多重间隔盘的旋转水蒸气发射的激发条件。我们呈现了两温度H2O平板模型的检索，并通过拟合参数化径向温度和柱密度分布首次限制水蒸气的空间分布。这些模型在统计上胜过了两温度平板拟合。我们发现可观测的热水蒸气质量与恒星质量吸积率之间存在相关性，以及冷水蒸气质量与亚毫米尘盘半径之间存在反相关性，证实了先前报告的水线通量趋势。我们发现，中红外光谱追踪的H2O的温度下降至180-300 K，但最冷的150-170 K气体仍然未被探测到。此外，H2O温度分布通常比被动辐射盘中预期的“过热”尘埃温度更加陡峭和凉爽。柱密度分布用于估算冰冷卵石质量通量，这表明如果局部进食机制主导它们的组装，紧凑盘和多重间隔盘可能产生明显不同的内盘系外行星种群。<br /><br />总结:文章研究了使用JWST MIRI-MRS对恒星周围行星形成盘的水蒸气发射光谱进行了分析，并针对紧凑盘和多重间隔盘进行了比较。结果显示紧凑盘的水蒸气发射量较高，且与恒星质量吸积率相关，而多重间隔盘的冷水蒸气质量与亚毫米尘盘半径呈反相关。文章还从H2O温度和柱密度分布方面对冰冷卵石质量通量进行了估算，并指出紧凑盘和多重间隔盘可能产生不同的内盘系外行星种群。 <div>
The mid-infrared water vapor emission spectrum provides a novel way to characterize the delivery of icy pebbles toward the innermost (<5 au) regions of planet-forming disks. Recently, JWST MIRI-MRS showed that compact disks exhibit an excess of low-energy water vapor emission relative to extended multigapped disks, suggesting that icy pebble drift is more efficient in the former. We carry out detailed emission-line modeling to retrieve the excitation conditions of rotational water vapor emission in a sample of four compact and three extended disks within the JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey. We present two-temperature H2O slab model retrievals and, for the first time, constrain the spatial distribution of water vapor by fitting parametric radial temperature and column density profiles. Such models statistically outperform the two-temperature slab fits. We find a correlation between the observable hot water vapor mass and stellar mass accretion rate, as well as an anticorrelation between cold water vapor mass and submillimeter dust disk radius, confirming previously reported water line flux trends. We find that the mid-IR spectrum traces H2O with temperatures down to 180–300 K, but the coldest 150–170 K gas remains undetected. Furthermore the H2O temperature profiles are generally steeper and cooler than the expected “superheated” dust temperature in passive irradiated disks. The column density profiles are used to estimate icy pebble mass fluxes, which suggest that compact and extended disks may produce markedly distinct inner-disk exoplanet populations if local feeding mechanisms dominate their assembly.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究对漫射超新星（SN）中微子背景（DSNB）的通量谱、事件率和实验灵敏度进行了研究，该中微子背景源自过去的恒星坍缩，也被称为超新星残留中微子背景。研究考虑了导致成功超新星爆发和黑洞（BH）形成的坍缩对DSNB的贡献，后者从银河系化学演化的角度来看可能是一个不可忽视的种群。如果BH形成的超新星涉及长期对原中子星的物质回落，它们的总发射中微子能量将比普通超新星和失败的超新星（BH形成而没有爆炸）大得多。然后，在正常的中微子振荡质量层次和所有核心坍缩超新星的一半都是BH形成的超新星的情况下，由于BH形成的超新星，根据当前的DSNB模型，期望的事件率增加了一倍。尽管在确定物质回落的持续时间（决定总发射中微子量）和BH形成超新星的比例方面存在实质性的不确定性，但由于这种贡献，Hyper-Kamiokande探测DSNB所需的运行时间无论如何都将缩短。 <div>
The flux spectrum, event rate, and experimental sensitivity are investigated for the diffuse supernova (SN) neutrino background (DSNB), which originates from past stellar collapses and is also known as a supernova relic neutrino background. For this purpose, the contribution of collapses that lead to successful supernova explosion and black hole (BH) formation simultaneously, which are suggested to be a nonnegligible population from the perspective of Galactic chemical evolution, is taken into account. If the BH-forming SNe involve matter fallback onto the protoneutron star for the long term, their total emitted neutrino energy becomes much larger than that of ordinary SNe and failed SNe (BH formation without explosion). Then, in the case of the normal mass hierarchy in neutrino oscillations and with half of all core-collapse SNe being BH-forming SNe, the expected event rate according to the current DSNB model is enhanced by up to a factor of 2 due to the BH-forming SNe. While substantial uncertainties exist regarding the duration of the matter fallback, which determines the total amount of emitted neutrinos, and the fraction of BH-forming SNe, the operation time required to detect the DSNB at Hyper-Kamiokande would be reduced by such contribution in any case.

总结:
研究发现，比亮度最高的GRB 221009A还要亮的伽马射线暴的发生率可能比之前估计的要高得多，这些可能来自一个独立的窄喷流GRB种群。这个种群在红移上有一个上限，以避免过度产生较暗的GRB。这可能对未来外星生命搜索产生影响。此外，窄喷流种群的能量更有利于产生超高能宇宙射线。在银河系内，有能够引发地球生命大灭绝的超亮GRB的发生率估计约为每5亿年一次。 <div>
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) brighter than the GRB 221009A, the brightest yet observed, have previously been estimated to occur at a rate of one per 10,000 yr, based on the extrapolation of the distribution of fluences of the long-GRB population. We show that bursts this bright could instead have a rate as high as approximately one per 200 yr if they are from a separate population of narrow-jet GRBs. This population must have a maximum redshift of about z ≈ 0.38 in order to avoid overproducing the observed rate of fainter GRBs. We show that it will take ≳100 yr to confirm this new population based on observing another GRB from it with a γ-ray detector; observing an orphan optical afterglow from this population with Vera Rubin Observatory or an orphan radio afterglow with the Square Kilometer Array will also take similarly long times to observe, and it is unclear if they could be distinguished from the standard GRB population. We show that the nearby narrow-jet population has more favorable energetics for producing ultra-high-energy cosmic rays than standard GRBs. The rate of bursts in the Milky Way bright enough to cause mass extinctions of life on Earth from the narrow-jet population is estimated to be approximately one per 500 Myr. This GRB population could make life in the Milky Way less likely, with implications for future searches for life on exoplanets.

总结: 
通过分析太阳动力学观测卫星的观测数据，研究人员改进了WLF识别方法，成功识别出更多的太阳白光耀斑，并得到了准确的光变曲线。研究发现，在每个GOES能级中，受限耀斑中的WLF比喷发性耀斑中更为常见。此外，WLF的能量和持续时间之间发现了一种幂律关系。研究结果表明，通过优化识别方法，可以识别更多的太阳WLF，为未来对太阳和恒星WLF的统计和比较研究奠定了基础。<br /><br /> <div>
White-light flares (WLFs) are energetic activity in the stellar atmosphere. However, observed solar WLFs are relatively rare compared to stellar WLFs or solar flares observed at other wavelengths, which limits our further understanding of solar/stellar WLFs through statistical studies. By analyzing flare observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, here we improve WLF identification methods to obtain more solar WLFs and their accurate light curves from two aspects: (1) imposing constraints defined by the typical temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of WLF-induced signals; and (2) setting the intrinsic threshold for each pixel in the flare ribbon region according to its inherent background fluctuation rather than a fixed threshold for the whole region. Applying the optimized method to 90 flares (30 C-class flares, 30 M-class flares, and 30 X-class flares) for a statistical study, we identified a total of nine C-class WLFs, 18 M-class WLFs, and 28 X-class WLFs. The WLF identification rate of C-class flares reported here reaches 30%, which is the highest to date to our best knowledge. It is also revealed that in each GOES energy level the proportion of WLFs is higher in confined flares than that in eruptive flares. Moreover, a power-law relation is found between the WLF energy (E) and duration (τ): τ ∝ E0.22, similar to those of solar hard/soft X-ray flares and other stellar WLFs. These results indicate that we could recognize more solar WLFs through optimizing the identification method, which will lay a base for future statistical and comparison study of solar and stellar WLFs.

In this study, we examine 51 archival NICER observations and six archival NuSTAR observations of the neutron star ultracompact X-ray binary (UCXB) 4U 0614+091, which span over 5 yr. The source displays persistent reflection features, so we use a reflection model designed for UCXBs, with overabundant carbon and oxygen (xillverCO) to study how various components of the system vary over time. The flux of this source is known to vary quasiperiodically on a timescale of a few days, so we study how the various model components change as the overall flux varies. The flux of most components scales linearly with the overall flux, while the power law, representing coronal emission, is anticorrelated, as expected. This is consistent with previous studies of the source. We also find that during observations of the high-soft state, the disk emissivity profile as a function of radius becomes steeper. We interpret this as the corona receding to be closer to the compact object during these states, at which point the assumed power law illumination of xillverCO may be inadequate to describe the illumination of the disk.

<div> 关键词: 4U 1820-30, NICER, 爆发, PRE, 振荡<br />
总结: <br />
研究使用NICER观测了4U 1820-30的15次热核X射线爆发，发现所有的爆发都显示出明显的光球半径膨胀现象。在其中一次爆发中首次观测到了超级膨胀，黑体发射半径达到902公里。研究还在其中一次爆发中发现了具有716赫兹频率的相干振荡信号，但仅为2.9σ的显著性水平。同时还观测到了爆发振荡的能量范围为3-10keV的分数rms振幅为5.8%。此外，还观测到了爆发光谱中峰值时的低电离度值。根据反射建模，推测这可能由部分相互作用的内部吸积盘或弱电离的外部盘引起。 <br /> <div>
We present the results obtained from timing and spectral studies of 15 thermonuclear X-ray bursts from 4U 1820–30 observed with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) during its 5 yr of observations between 2017 and 2022. All bursts showed clear signs of photospheric radius expansion (PRE), where the neutron star (NS) photosphere expanded more than 50 km above the surface. One of the bursts produced a superexpansion with a blackbody emission radius of 902 km for the first time with NICER. We searched for burst oscillations in all 15 bursts and found evidence of a coherent oscillation at 716 Hz in a burst, with a 2.9σ detection level based on Monte Carlo simulations. If confirmed with future observations, 4U 1820–30 would become the fastest-spinning NS known in X-ray binary systems. The fractional rms amplitude of the candidate burst oscillation was found to be 5.8% in the energy range of 3–10 keV. Following the variable persistent model from burst time-resolved spectroscopy, an anticorrelation is seen between the maximum scaling factor value and the (preburst) persistent flux. We detected a low value of ionization at the peak of each burst based on reflection modeling of burst spectra. A partially interacting inner accretion disk or a weakly ionized outer disk may cause the observed ionization dip during the PRE phase.

<title>Probing Three-dimensional Magnetic Fields. III. Synchrotron Emission and Machine Learning</title>

Synchrotron observation serves as a tool for studying magnetic fields in the interstellar medium and intracluster medium, yet its ability to unveil three-dimensional (3D) magnetic fields, meaning probing the field’s plane-of-the-sky (POS) orientation, inclination angle relative to the line of sight, and magnetization from one observational data, remains largely underexplored. Inspired by the latest insights into anisotropic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, we found that synchrotron emission’s intensity structures inherently reflect this anisotropy, providing crucial information to aid in 3D magnetic field studies: (i) the structure’s elongation gives the magnetic field’s POS orientation and (ii) the structure’s anisotropy degree and topology reveal the inclination angle and magnetization. Capitalizing on this foundation, we integrate a machine learning approach—convolutional neural network (CNN)—to extract this latent information, thereby facilitating the exploration of 3D magnetic fields. The model is trained on synthetic synchrotron emission maps, derived from 3D MHD turbulence simulations encompassing a range of sub-Alfvénic to super-Alfvénic conditions. We show that the CNN is physically interpretable and the CNN is capable of obtaining the POS orientation, inclination angle, and magnetization. Additionally, we test the CNN against the noise effect and the missing low-spatial frequency. We show that this CNN-based approach maintains a high degree of robustness even when only high-spatial frequencies are maintained. This renders the method particularly suitable for application to interferometric data lacking single-dish measurements. We applied this trained CNN to the synchrotron observations of a diffuse region. The CNN-predicted POS magnetic field orientation shows a statistical agreement with that derived from synchrotron polarization.

<div> 关键词: 宇宙射线扩散, 磁场湍流, 非线性磁旋, 粒子模拟, 磁场不均匀

总结:<br /><br />这项研究探讨了在无强磁场存在的情况下，宇宙射线在磁场湍流中的扩散问题。研究发现了三种不同的扩散机制，分别是镜像扩散、漫游扩散和磁矩散射。结果显示，CR的扩散也具有空间不均匀性，低能CR更倾向于在强磁场区域发生镜像扩散和漫游扩散，而高能CR更偏向于发生磁矩散射，这导致了CR的平均自由程（MFP）对能量的依赖性不同。这项研究强调了非线性磁旋引起的磁场不均匀性对CR扩散行为的基本作用。 <div>
The diffusion of cosmic rays (CRs) in turbulent magnetic fields is fundamental to understanding various astrophysical processes. We explore the CR diffusion in the magnetic fluctuations amplified by the nonlinear turbulent dynamo in the absence of a strong mean magnetic field. Using test particle simulations, we identify three distinct CR diffusion regimes: mirroring, wandering, and magnetic moment scattering (MMS). With highly inhomogeneous distribution of the dynamo-amplified magnetic fields, we find that the diffusion of CRs is also spatially inhomogeneous. Our results reveal that lower-energy CRs preferentially undergo the mirror and wandering diffusion in the strong-field regions, and the MMS diffusion in the weak-field regions. The former two diffusion mechanisms play a more important role toward lower CR energies, resulting in a relatively weak energy dependence of the overall CR mean free path (MFP). In contrast, higher-energy CRs predominantly undergo the MMS diffusion, for which the incomplete particle gyration, i.e., the limit case of mirroring, in strong fields has a more significant effect than the scattering by small-scale field tangling/reversal. Compared with lower-energy CRs, they are more poorly confined in space and their MFPs have a stronger energy dependence. We stress the fundamental role of magnetic field inhomogeneity of nonlinear turbulent dynamo in causing the different diffusion behavior of CRs compared to that in sub-Alfvénic magnetohydrodynamic turbulence.

<div> 关键词: dark energy, ΛXCDM模型, phantom matter, 引力波, 宇宙学数据

总结:<br /><br />本文讨论了复合暗能量的概念，认为虚空能量密度可能与其他有效的暗能量形式相结合。作者提出了wXCDM模型，并研究了phantom matter的可能性。实验结果表明，使用BAO 2D数据拟合时，H0和生长张力几乎消失。然而，使用各向异性BAO（BAO 3D）时，缓解H0张力的能力明显降低。最后，实验结果支持DE在z≃1.5以下呈现类似quintessence行为，与近期DESI测量相符。 <div>
The idea of composite dark energy (DE) is quite natural since on general grounds we expect that the vacuum energy density (associated with the cosmological term Λ) may appear in combination with other effective forms of DE, denoted X. Here we deal with model wXCDM, a simplified version of the old ΛXCDM model, and exploit the possibility that X behaves as “phantom matter” (PM), which appears in stringy versions of the running vacuum model (RVM). Unlike phantom DE, the PM fluid satisfies the strong energy condition like usual matter, hence bringing to bear positive pressure at the expense of negative energy. Bubbles of PM may appear in the manner of a transitory “phantom vacuum” tunneled into the late Universe before it heads toward a new de Sitter era, thereby offering a crop field for the growing of structures earlier than expected. Using Type Ia supernovae, cosmic chronometers, transversal baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO 2D), large-scale structure data, and the full cosmic microwave background likelihood from Planck 2018, we find that the H0 and growth tensions virtually disappear, provided that BAO 2D are the only source of BAO data used in the fit. In contrast, our preliminary analysis using exclusively anisotropic BAO (BAO 3D) indicates that the ability to ease the H0 tension is significantly reduced as compared to the scenario with BAO 2D, despite the fact that the overall fit to the cosmological data is still better than in the ΛCDM. Finally, our approach with BAO 2D favors quintessence-like behavior of the DE below z ≃ 1.5 at ≳3σ confidence level, which is compatible with the recent DESI measurements.

<div> 白矮星，磁场演化，结晶驱动发电机，电导率，对流扩散<br />
总结:<br />
本研究调查了质量≲1.05 M⊙的碳氧白矮星中生成的晶化驱动发电机产生的磁场的演化。研究表明，初始磁场强度(B0)受初始对流区大小(Rout,0)和白矮星质量的限制。在发电机阶段结束后，通过解诱导方程可以追踪磁场演化，预测的表面磁场强度(Bsurf)与B0相差至少约0.3倍，取决于Rout,0。我们实现了考虑固体相对欧姆扩散的电导率，观察到当固体核增长时电导率会增加，磁场在演化的某一点冻结，并减缓其向外传输。我们研究了对流引起的磁扩散效应，并发现对于较小的Rout,0，Bsurf比非湍流扩散情况更强，但仍比B0小数个数量级。鉴于这些限制，结晶驱动的发电机理论只能解释质量范围为0.45-1.05 M⊙的磁性C/O白矮星，其磁场强度小于几兆高斯。我们的研究结果还表明，如果结晶驱动的对流负责将埋藏的化石磁场输送到表面，则其强度必须至少比观测到的表面磁场强度大100倍。 <div>
We investigate the evolution of magnetic fields generated by the crystallization-driven dynamo in carbon–oxygen white dwarfs (WDs) with masses ≲1.05 M⊙. We use scalings for the dynamo to demonstrate that the initial magnetic field strength (B0) has an upper limit that depends on the initial convection zone size (Rout,0) and the WD mass. We solve the induction equation to follow the magnetic field evolution after the dynamo phase ends. We show that the predicted surface magnetic field strength (Bsurf) differs from B0 by at least a factor of ∼0.3. This reduction depends on Rout,0, where values smaller than half of the star radius give Bsurf ≲ 0.01 B0. We implement electrical conductivities that account for the solid phase effect on the ohmic diffusion. We observe that the conductivity increases as the solid core grows, freezing in the magnetic field at a certain point of the evolution and slowing its outward transport. We study the effect of turbulent magnetic diffusivity induced by the convection and find that for a small Rout,0, Bsurf is stronger than the nonturbulent diffusion cases because of the more rapid transport, but still orders of magnitude smaller than B0. Given these limitations, the crystallization-driven dynamo theory could explain only magnetic C/O WDs with field strengths less than a few megagauss for the mass range 0.45–1.05 M⊙. Our results also suggest that a buried fossil field must be at least 100 times stronger than observed surface fields if crystallization-driven convection is responsible for its transport to the surface.

<div> 光子旋涡，强磁场，光子吸收，角动量，核合成
总结:<br /><br />研究表明，光子旋涡主要在宇宙中极强的磁场中产生。光子旋涡在与原子核相互作用中可能导致显著的大角动量转移，影响了这些天体环境中的恒星核合成过程。研究中计算了贝塞尔波描述的光子旋涡与平面波光子之间的吸收跃迁概率比值。结果显示，通过在动量空间中优化入射光子旋涡的发散角度，促进了对具有大总角动量的态的激发。然而，光子旋涡的平均截面结果与平面波相同。因此，即使贝塞尔光子在天体环境中被主要产生出来，合成元素的同位素丰度并不会改变。 <div>
It is thought that photon vortices are predominantly produced in extremely strong magnetic fields in the Universe. Because the photon vortex may cause significant large angular momentum transfer in interactions with atomic nuclei, stellar nucleosynthesis in such astrophysical environments is affected. In the present study, we calculate the ratios of the photon absorption transition probabilities of photon vortices with Bessel wave to photons described by the plane wave. The result shows enhancement of excitation of states with large total angular momentum by optimization of the divergence angle of the incident photon vortex in momentum space. However, the average cross section for the photon vortex turns out to be identical with that for the plane wave. Therefore, even when Bessel photons are predominantly produced in astrophysical environments, the isotopic abundances of the synthesized elements are not changed.

总结:
太阳物理学领域长期存在一个未解之谜，即在太阳黑子区域是否存在局部磁流体力学作用。本文报道了一种磁场演化的观察模式，使得太阳黑子区域充满了复杂性和能量。这种异常模式表现为特殊的双极磁场出现，具有以下特征：（1）双极磁场出现在太阳黑子的边缘，环绕太阳黑子并以端对端的方式延伸；（2）每个双极磁场会沿着以太阳黑子为中心的弧线轨迹逐渐增长并分离两种极性；（3）在双极磁场演化过程中，在紫外线/极紫外辐射中出现圆形发光带；（4）具有这种演化模式的太阳黑子区域通常表现出强烈的太阳活动，如均匀的大型耀斑。磁场的演化模式和相关的耀斑活动表明存在局部磁流体力学作用，我们将其描述为扭曲-重新连接的动力机制。 <div>
In solar physics, a long-unanswered question is whether or not there are local dynamos acting in sunspot regions. Here we report an observed pattern of magnetic evolution that makes the sunspots alive with ample complexity and energy. This anomalous pattern manifests as peculiar bipolar magnetic emergences (BMEs), exhibiting the following characteristics: (1) the BMEs persistently appear beyond the penumbra, encircling the sunspot in an end-to-end configuration; (2) each BME gradually grows and separates its two polarities along an arc trajectory centered on the sunspot; (3) a circular brightening belt is manifested in the ultraviolet/extreme-ultraviolet radiations during the BMEs’ evolution; and (4) the sunspot regions with such an evolution pattern often exhibit vigorous solar activity, such as homogeneous major flares. The magnetic evolving pattern and relevant flare activity indicate the presence of a local dynamo, and we characterize it as a twisting-reconnecting dynamo.

<div> 关键词: Magellanic Clouds, Hubble Space Telescope, stellar population properties, star formation histories, radial age gradient
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章主要研究了大麦哲伦云附近的相互作用的矮星系及其恒星群体特性的空间趋势。研究利用斯科拉纯并行计划获得的哈勃空间望远镜图像和现有的档案数据，对大麦哲伦云内111个个体区域的星际颜色-星等图进行了生存历史拟合。研究发现，目前的径向年龄梯度从内部盘面的内向梯度转变为在大约2个盘面尺度长度之外的外向梯度，在较早的回溯时期梯度相对较平缓，而反转的位置在回溯时间上保持不变。文章还将观测到的径向年龄趋势与固定质量的其他晚期星系进行了比较，并讨论了在可能的驱动因素背景下的相似性和差异性，暗示了在大麦哲伦云中存在着强烈的径向迁移。 <div>
The proximity of the Magellanic Clouds provides the opportunity to study interacting dwarf galaxies near a massive host, and spatial trends in their stellar population properties in particular, with a unique level of detail. The Scylla pure parallel program has obtained deep (80% complete to >1 mag below the ancient main-sequence turnoff), homogeneous two-filter Hubble Space Telescope imaging sampling the inner star-forming disk of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the perfect complement to shallower, contiguous ground-based surveys. We harness this imaging together with extant archival data and fit lifetime star formation histories (SFHs) to resolved color–magnitude diagrams of 111 individual fields, using three different stellar evolutionary libraries. We validate per-field recovered distances and extinctions, as well as the combined global LMC age–metallicity relation and SFH against independent estimates. We find that the present-day radial age gradient reverses from an inside-out gradient in the inner disk to an outside-in gradient beyond ∼2 disk scale lengths, supported by ground-based measurements. The gradients become relatively flatter at earlier look-back times, while the location of the inversion remains constant over an order of magnitude in look-back time, from ∼1 to 10 Gyr. This suggests at least one mechanism that predates the recent intense LMC–Small Magellanic Cloud interaction. We compare observed radial age trends to other late-type galaxies at fixed stellar mass and discuss similarities and differences in the context of potential drivers, implying strong radial migration in the LMC.

Indirect methods have proven to be a complementary approach for extending our knowledge of nuclear structure and low-energy cross sections. Among these, the neutron-induced reaction cross sections appear to be of particular interest since their role both for unstable and stable beams. In view of this, we report here the combined study of the 17O(n, α)14C reaction accomplished by the Trojan Horse Method (THM) and the asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC) method. The low-lying 8038, 8125, 8213, and 8282 keV resonances in 18O are studied, and their Γn are derived. A comparison with recent direct data and recent THM experimental data is presented. The independent ANC investigation corroborates our previous THM results, confirms the consistence of the two indirect investigations, and shows new frontiers for neutron-induced reactions with radioactive ion beams. Moreover, we examined the impact of adopting the newly recommended 17O(n, α)14C reaction rate on asymptotic giant branch stars' nucleosynthesis. Our findings reveal significant variations (≳10%) in the production of the neutron-rich heavy isotopes sensitive to neutron density, underlining the neutron-poisoning effect of 17O on the s-process.

这篇文章对两颗新发现的Ba巨星进行了详细的化学特征研究，并确认它们是外部s-过程星。通过高分辨率的UVES光谱观测，测量了22种元素的丰度，发现它们在所有测量的s-过程元素上都有明显的富集。此外，两颗星都表现出了轨道速度的变化，很可能是双星系统。在Eu元素上的轻微富集表明污染源是纯s-过程来源。这些新发现的双星系统的丰度与传统的Ba巨星相符，为更好地理解AGB星体内的s-过程提供了观测约束。 
<br /> <div>
Barium (Ba) stars are chemically peculiar stars that show enhanced surface abundances of heavy elements produced by the slow-neutron-capture process, the so-called s-process. These stars are not sufficiently evolved to undergo the s-process in their interiors, so they are considered products of binary interactions. Ba stars form when a former Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) companion, which is now a white dwarf, pollutes them with s-process-rich material through mass transfer. This paper presents a detailed chemical characterization of two newly discovered Ba giants. Our main goal is to confirm their status as extrinsic s-process stars and explore potential binarity and white dwarf companions. We obtained high-resolution spectra with UVES on the Very Large Telescope to determine the chemical properties of the targets. We perform line-by-line analyses and measure 22 elements with an internal precision up to 0.04 dex. The binary nature of the targets is investigated through radial velocity variability and spectral energy distribution fitting. We found that both targets are enhanced in all the measured s-process elements, classifying our targets as Ba giants. This is the first time they are classified as such in the literature. Additionally, both stars present a mild enhancement in Eu, but less than in pure s-process elements, suggesting that the sources that polluted them were pure s-process sources. Finally, we confirmed that the two targets are RV variable and likely binary systems. The abundances in these two newly discovered polluted binaries align with classical Ba giants, providing observational constraints to better understand the s-process in AGB stars.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章探讨了对于超热木星大气透射光谱的多维大气检索中忽略夜侧热辐射可能造成的偏差。通过模拟JWST对超热木星WASP-33b的透射光谱，发现不考虑夜侧辐射会导致分子丰度被高估近一个数量级，同时低估白天温度约400K。研究提出了修改后的检索方法，包括透射光和夜侧热辐射，通过贝叶斯模型比较得到支持。作者建议在解释JWST观测的超热木星透射光谱时，应将夜侧热辐射作为标准做法纳入考虑。同时，文章提供了估算该效应对于给定行星是否重要的公式。 <div>
Transmission spectroscopy is the most widely used technique for studying exoplanet atmospheres. Since the planetary nightside faces the observer during a transit, highly irradiated giant exoplanets with warm nightsides emit thermal radiation that can contaminate transmission spectra. Observations of ultrahot Jupiters in the near- and mid-infrared with JWST are especially susceptible to nightside contamination. However, nightside thermal emission is generally not considered in atmospheric retrievals of exoplanet transmission spectra. Here, we quantify the potential biases from neglecting nightside thermal emission in multidimensional atmospheric retrievals of an ultrahot Jupiter. Using simulated JWST transmission spectra of the ultrahot Jupiter WASP-33b (0.8–12 μm), we find that transmission spectrum retrievals without nightside emission can overestimate molecular abundances by almost an order of magnitude and underestimate the dayside temperature by ≳400 K. We show that a modified retrieval prescription, including both transmitted light and nightside thermal emission, correctly recovers the atmospheric properties and is favored by Bayesian model comparisons. Nightside thermal contamination can be readily implemented in retrieval models via a first-order approximation, and we provide formulae to estimate whether this effect is likely to be significant for a given planet. We recommend that nightside emission should be included as standard practice when interpreting ultrahot Jupiter transmission spectra with JWST.

<br /><br />在矮星系中检测活动黑洞一直是一项艰巨的任务，因为它们的体积小、电磁信号弱。然而，中红外变异性已经成为一种有前景的工具，可以用来检测矮星系中的活跃低质量黑洞。作者分析了AllWISE/NEOWISE多时期目录中10.4年的光度数据，发现了25个表现出类星体活性的物体。通过光学和近红外诊断，独立确认了这些物体中68%的AGN活动。此外，在样本中最低恒星质量（log M* = 7.5 M⊙）和低金属丰度（12 + log(O/H) = 7.46）的J1205中发现了近红外冕线[S ix] λ 1.252 μm。此外，两个目标中观测到的广Paα线可能来自宽线区域，其推断的黑洞质量与黑洞-恒星质量关系一致。虽然作者发现在相似恒星质量和Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer W1 − W2颜色的非变异性星系中并没有明显趋势，但他们发现AGN活动可能导致变异目标中W1 − W2颜色较红，而在非变异性星系中，这种贡献来自强烈的恒星形成活动。此外，变异目标中也观测到了高比例的光学宽线。研究结果表明，中红外变异性是一种有效的方法，可以用来检测低质量星系中的AGN活动，并有助于发现宇宙中更大样本的活跃低质量(<106M⊙)黑洞。 <div>
Detecting active black holes in dwarf galaxies has proven to be a challenge due to their small size and weak electromagnetic signatures. Mid-infrared variability has emerged as a promising tool that can be used to detect active low-mass black holes in dwarf galaxies. We analyzed 10.4 yr of photometry from the AllWISE/NEOWISE multiepoch catalogs, identifying 25 objects with active galactic nuclei (AGN)-like variability. Independent confirmation of AGN activity was found in 68% of these objects using optical and near-infrared diagnostics. Notably, we discover a near-infrared coronal line [S ix] λ 1.252 μm in J1205, the galaxy with the lowest stellar mass (log M* = 7.5 M⊙) and low metallicity (12 + log(O/H) = 7.46) in our sample. Additionally, we find broad Paα potentially from the broad-line region in two targets, and their implied black hole masses are consistent with black hole-stellar mass relations. Comparing nonvariable galaxies with similar stellar masses and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer W1 − W2 colors, we find no clear trends between variability and large-scale galaxy properties. However, we find that AGN activity likely causes redder W1 − W2 colors in variable targets, while for the nonvariable galaxies, the contribution stems from strong star formation activity. A high incidence of optical broad lines was also observed in variable targets. Our results suggest that mid-infrared variability is an effective method for detecting AGN activity in low-mass galaxies and can help uncover a larger sample of active low-mass (<106M⊙) black holes in the Universe.

We present a new grid of cloudy atmosphere and evolution models for substellar objects. These models include the effect of refractory cloud species, including silicate clouds, on the spectra and evolution. We include effective temperatures from 900 to 2400 K and surface gravities from log g = 3.5 to 5.5, appropriate for a broad range of objects with masses between 1 and 84 MJ. Model pressure–temperature structures are calculated assuming radiative–convective and chemical equilibrium. We consider the effect of both clouds and metallicity on the atmospheric structure, resulting spectra, and thermal evolution of substellar worlds. We parameterize clouds using the A. S. Ackerman & M. S. Marley cloud model, including cloud parameter fsed values from 1 to 8; we include three metallicities (−0.5, 0.0, and +0.5). Refractory clouds and metallicity both alter the evolution of substellar objects, changing the inferred temperature at a given age by up to 100–200 K. For solar-metallicity evolution models including clouds in warm objects, we find a hydrogen-burning minimum mass of 70.2 MJ, close to empirical measurements; we find a deuterium-burning minimum mass of 12.05 MJ (50% of initial D burned). We compare to the observed photometry of brown dwarfs, finding broad agreement with the measured photometry. We publish the spectra, evolution, and other data products online with open access on Zenodo (doi:10.5281/zenodo.12735103).

<div> 关键词: 反馈驱动、大规模流出、星系演化、光学深度、SALT模型
总结:<br /><br />该研究探讨了反馈驱动的大规模流出在星系演化中的关键作用。通过对光学深度方法和SALT模型两种方法的比较分析，发现前者可能会低估大气柱密度，特别是在光学厚的情况下。模拟结果显示，这种差异的主要原因是在低速度下存在大量的密集物质，而这些物质可能会被有限的光谱分辨率所隐藏。因此，对于1D光谱的外流性质推断中存在着一定的不确定性，需要更加精细的建模和分析。 <div>
Feedback-driven massive outflows play a crucial role in galaxy evolution by regulating star formation and influencing the dynamics of surrounding media. Extracting outflow properties from spectral lines is a notoriously difficult process for a number of reasons, including the possibility that a substantial fraction of the outflow is carried by dense gas in a very narrow range in velocity. This gas can hide in spectra with insufficient resolution. Empirically motivated analysis based on the apparent optical depth method, commonly used in the literature, neglects the contribution of this gas, and may therefore underestimate the true gas column density. More complex semianalytical line transfer (e.g., SALT) models, on the other hand, allow for the presence of this gas by modeling the radial density and velocity of the outflows as power laws. Here we compare the two approaches to quantify the uncertainties in the inferences of outflow properties based on 1D “down-the-barrel” spectra, using the UV spectra of the CLASSY galaxy sample. We find that empirical modeling may significantly underestimate the column densities relative to SALT analysis, particularly in the optically thick regime. We use simulations to show that the main reason for this discrepancy is the presence of a large amount of dense material at low velocities, which can be hidden by the finite spectral resolution of the data. The SALT models in turn could overestimate the column densities if the assumed power laws of the density profiles are not a property of actual outflows.

<div> 关键词: accreting neutron stars, magnetic field, disk structure, jet power, general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations<br />
<br />总结:<br />文章讨论了增积中子星与黑洞的不同之处，重点在于增积中子星自身的磁场对增积流的影响。研究了两种极端情况下的3D广义相对论磁流体力学模拟，发现了不同磁场方向对系统性质的影响。当磁层在共转半径附近截断盘时，系统的大部分特性都与星-盘相对极性无关。然而，当盘 extends well inside the corotation radius时，与初始盘磁场平行方向下，喷流功率被抑制，内盘密度较低并且磁化更强。提出了可能解释这种行为的物理机制，即交换弹射，并讨论了其天体物理学意义。当星处于快速增积状态时，我们预期两种磁场方向之间会有较大的观测差异，这可能反映为随着增积流带入连续磁结构的不同极性而增加的变化。 <div>
Accreting neutron stars differ from black holes by the presence of the star’s own magnetic field, whose interaction with the accretion flow is a central component in understanding these systems’ disk structure, outflows, jets, and spin evolution. It also introduces an additional degree of freedom, as the stellar dipole can have any orientation relative to the inner disk’s magnetic field. We present a suite of 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations in which we investigate the two extreme polarities, with the dipole field being either parallel or antiparallel to the initial disk field, in both the accreting and propeller states. When the magnetosphere truncates the disk near or beyond the corotation radius, most of the system’s properties, including the relativistic jet power, are independent of the star–disk relative polarity. However, when the disk extends well inside the corotation radius, in the parallel orientation the jet power is suppressed and the inner disk is less dense and more strongly magnetized. We suggest a physical mechanism that may account for this behavior—the interchange slingshot—and discuss its astrophysical implications. When the star is in the rapidly accreting regime, which in most cases will be associated with strong spin-up, we expect large observational differences between the two magnetic orientations. This may be reflected in increased variability as the accretion flow drags in successive magnetic structures of varying polarity.

We conducted a comprehensive variability analysis of the blazar PKS 2255-282 using Fermi-LAT observations spanning over 4 yr, from MJD 57783.5 to 59358.5. Our analysis revealed a transient quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) with a period of 93 ± 2.6 days. We employed a variety of Fourier-based methods, including the Lomb–Scargle periodogram (LSP) and weighted wavelet Z-transform (WWZ), as well as time domain analysis techniques such as seasonal and nonseasonal autoregressive Integrated moving average models and the Stochastic modeling with stochastically driven damped harmonic oscillator models. Consistently, the QPO with a period of 93 days was detected across all methods used. The observed peak in LSP and time-averaged WWZ plots has a significance level of 4.06σ and 3.96σ, respectively. To understand the source of flux modulations in the light curve, we explored various physical models. A plausible scenario involves the precession of the jet with a high Lorentz factor or the movement of a plasma blob along a helical trajectory within the relativistic jet.

The spins of binary black holes (BBHs) measured from gravitational waves contain valuable information about their formation pathways. In this study, we propose a new quantity, the “dimensionless net spin” (χN), which relates to the sum of the angular momenta of the component black holes (BHs) in the system, offering a novel perspective for exploring the origins of BBHs. Through hierarchical Bayesian inference on χN, we find strong evidence that its distribution is better described by two Gaussian components rather than one, and their branching ratios vary with total mass and redshift: there is a narrow peak at χN ∼ 0.15 and an extended peak at χN ∼ 0.3–0.6. The rapidly spinning systems likely dominate the high-mass end of the population and evolve with redshift more quickly. These findings present new challenges to the field binary formation scenario and suggest that dynamical processes may play a key role in the formation of high total mass BBHs.

总结:<br />
该研究关注高红移（z>3）的Lyman连续体（LyC）发射源，这些样本对于研究星系在再电离时期对离子化背景的贡献至关重要。研究收集了一组z>3的LyC发射源，其中有60%–70%的样本显示LyC发射和非电离连续发射之间的空间偏移。特别是，发现了一个偏移的LyC发射源CDFS-6664（z=3.797），在Hubble Space Telescope和James Webb Space Telescope的高分辨率图像中显示两个组分。CDFS-6664的丰富数据集使研究能够在多个波长提取两个组分并估算其物理特性。研究表明，CDFS-6664与一个主要融合系统一致，两个组分的星形成均得到提升，且偏移的LyC发射很可能与这个融合系统中较蓝、较年轻的组分有关。这一结果为融合在LyC光子逸出中的作用提供了一个例子。未来的观测将阐明融合对LyC光子逸出的作用。 <div>
Lyman continuum (LyC) emitters at z > 3 provide critical samples for studying the contribution of galaxies to the ionizing background in the epoch of reionization. We collect a sample of z > 3 LyC emitters, a dominant fraction (∼60%–70%) of which show spatial offsets between LyC emission and the nonionizing continuum. From this sample, especially, we find a case of an offset LyC emitter, CDFS-6664 (z = 3.797), which shows two components in the high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope images. The exceptionally rich data set of CDFS-6664 enables us to extract the two components across multiple wavelengths and estimate their physical properties. We show that CDFS-6664 is consistent with a major merger system with boosted star formation in both components and that the offset LyC emission is most likely associated with the bluer and younger component in this merging system. Our result offers an example in which the offset can be caused by a merger. Future observations of more offset LyC emitters would elucidate the role that mergers play in the escape of LyC photons.

<br />总结: 本研究旨在探寻磁气动力学扭曲不稳定性的临界高度在太阳活动周期中的演变。通过对来自1996年至2023年的Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)和Michelson Doppler Imager Space-Weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARPs和SMARPs)的大量磁图进行分析，发现太阳活动周期影响着活跃区的临界高度，太阳极大期观察到更高的临界高度，主要原因是活跃区的总磁通量和极性之间的分离距离与临界高度成正比，而太阳极大期观察到更多磁通量更大、尺寸更大的磁区。这个发现引人注目，因为尽管临界高度较高，太阳极大期观察到的日冕质量抛射比太阳极小期更多。 <div>
The ideal magnetohydrodynamic torus instability can drive the eruption of coronal mass ejections. The critical threshold of magnetic field strength decay for the onset of the torus instability occurs at different heights in different solar active regions, and understanding this variation could therefore improve space weather prediction. In this work, we aim to find out how the critical torus instability height evolves throughout the solar activity cycle. We study a significant subset of Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) and Michelson Doppler Imager Space-Weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARPs and SMARPs) from 1996 to 2023, totaling 21,584 magnetograms from 4436 unique active-region patches. For each magnetogram, we compute the critical height averaged across the main polarity inversion line, the total unsigned magnetic flux, and the separation between the positive and negative magnetic polarities. We find the critical height in active regions varies with the solar cycle, with higher (lower) average critical heights observed around solar maximum (minimum). We conclude that this is because the critical height is proportional to the separation between opposite magnetic polarities, which in turn is proportional to the total magnetic flux in a region, and more magnetic regions with larger fluxes and larger sizes are observed at solar maximum. This result is noteworthy because, despite the higher critical heights, more coronal mass ejections are observed around solar maximum than at solar minimum.

总结:<br /><br />本研究分析了活跃星系核1ES 1927+654的多时期宽带光谱能量分布，揭示了其复杂、时变的吸积流特性。吸积率的衰减与1.1 M⊙恒星的潮汐破坏一致。光谱能量分布存在三个组成部分：类似超薄盘的中心过热区域、外部截断的薄盘以及热辐射区。高初始吸积率引发的超薄盘中的光子捕获表现出低辐射效率（3%），随后吸积率降至足够低时，盘转变为几何薄状态，辐射效率增加至8%。内部过热区域的黑体温度剖面T∝R-0.60符合超薄盘的理论预期，而外部区域的有效温度剖面T∝R-0.69与薄盘的预测相一致。两个剖面朝向盘的内边界均呈现出扁平化，这是因为辐射区内的康普顿冷却。本研究为超薄吸积盘的存在提供了令人信服的观测证据，并阐明了其行为的关键参数，为该领域的进一步探索铺平了道路。 <div>
The properties of slim accretion disks, while crucial for our understanding of black hole growth, have yet to be studied extensively observationally. We analyze the multiepoch broadband spectral energy distribution of the changing-look active galactic nucleus 1ES 1927+654 to derive the properties of its complex, time-dependent accretion flow. The accretion rate decays as , consistent with the tidal disruption of a 1.1 M⊙ star. Three components contribute to the spectral energy distribution: a central overheated zone resembling a slim disk, an outer truncated thin disk, and a hot corona. Photon trapping in the slim disk triggered by the high initial was characterized by a low radiation efficiency (3%), which later more than doubled (8%) after dropped sufficiently low for the disk to transition to a geometrically thin state. The blackbody temperature profile T ∝ R−0.60 for the inner overheated zone matches the theoretical expectations of a slim disk, while the effective temperature profile of T ∝ R−0.69 for the outer zone is consistent with the predictions of a thin disk. Both profiles flatten toward the inner boundary of the disk as a result of Compton cooling in the corona. Our work presents compelling observational evidence for the existence of slim accretion disks and elucidates the key parameters governing their behavior, paving the way for further exploration in this area.

米尔基亚路亚系周围介质中存在约10^6K的气体已经得到了充分证实。然而，新发现的约10^7K的“超维里尔”（SV）温度的热气体的位置和来源一直令人困惑。本文聚焦于排放气体，发现在排放状态下，“维里尔”和SV温度的气体占据了类似盘状的超平面区域，而不仅是充满了米尔基亚路亚系的弥散维里尔温度气体。我们进行理想的流体动力学模拟，结果显示约10^7K的排放气体很可能是在银河盘内外产生的恒星反馈的结果。此外，我们还发现超平面区域内的SV和维里尔温度排放气体富含金属，且不处于与米尔基亚路亚系相平衡的状态，而是不断演化着。<br /><br /> <div>
The presence of the ≈106 K gas in the circumgalactic medium of the Milky Way (MW) has been well established. However, the location and the origin of the newly discovered hot gas at “supervirial (SV)” temperatures of ≈107 K have been puzzling. This hot gas has been detected in both absorption and emission; here, we focus on the emitting gas only. We show that both the “virial” and the SV temperature gas, as observed in emission, occupy disk-like extraplanar regions, in addition to the diffuse virial temperature gas filling the halo of the MW. We perform idealized hydrodynamical simulations to show that the ≈107 K emitting gas is likely to be produced by stellar feedback in and around the Galactic disk. We further show that the emitting gas at both SV and virial temperatures in the extraplanar regions is metal enriched and is not in hydrostatic equilibrium with the halo but is continuously evolving.

We use the nonobservation of strong lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) in the first three observation runs of the LIGO and Virgo detectors to constrain the fraction of dark matter in the form of compact objects (COs) in the mass range 106−109M⊙. Using a Bayesian formalism supplemented by astrophysical simulations of strong lensing of GWs, we constrain the compact dark matter fraction to ≲0.4−0.6 with currently available data and show that they may get significantly tighter in the future. We find that multiple lensing—i.e., GWs getting deflected by multiple COs on their way to us—is possible. By ignoring this, we underestimate the constraints by a few percent.

太阳孔是理想的磁结构，可用于波传播和能量传输。研究模拟了具有光桥的孔的磁流激发和传播。通过数值求解磁气动力学方程，并计算环流来测量扭转运动。发现磁流之间的相互作用导致了自然激发的扭转阿尔文波，而单个磁流模型中没有扭转波。扭转阿尔文波的传播速度与波幅峰值处的局部阿尔文速度相匹配。 <div>
Solar pores are ideal magnetic structures for wave propagation and transport of energy radially outwards across the upper layers of the solar atmosphere. We aim to model the excitation and propagation of magnetohydrodynamic waves in a pore with a light bridge modeled as two interacting magnetic flux tubes separated by a thin, weaker-field layer. We solve the three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic equations numerically and calculate the circulation as a measure of net torsional motion. We find that the interaction between flux tubes results in the natural excitation of propagating torsional Alfvén waves but find no torsional waves in the model with a single flux tube. The torsional Alfvén waves propagate with wave speeds matching the local Alfvén speed where wave amplitude peaks.

While rotation-supported gas disks are known to exist as early as at z ≈ 7, it is still a general belief that stellar disks form late in the Universe. This picture is now being challenged by the observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which have revealed a large number of disk-like galaxies that could be at z > 3, with some being candidates at z > 7. As an early formation of stellar disks will greatly impact our theory of galaxy formation and evolution, it is important to determine when such systems first emerged. Here we present D-CEERS-RUBIES-z5289 at z = 5.289 ± 0.001, the second confirmed stellar disk at z > 5, discovered using the archival JWST NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec spectroscopic data. This galaxy has a highly regular edge-on disk morphology, extends to ∼6.2 kpc along its major axis, and has an effective radius of ∼1.3–1.4 kpc. Such a large stellar disk is yet to be produced in numerical simulations. By analyzing its 10-band spectral energy distribution using four different tools, we find that it has a high stellar mass of 109.5–10.0M⊙. Its age is in the range of 330–510 Myr, and it has a mild star formation rate of 10–30 M⊙ yr−1. While the current spectroscopic data do not allow the derivation of its rotation curve, the width of its Hα line from the partial slit coverage on one side of the disk reaches ∼345 km s−1, which suggests that it could have a significant contribution from rotation.

The proximity of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC) provides the opportunity to study the impact of dwarf–dwarf interactions on their mass assembly with a unique level of detail. To this end, we analyze two-filter broadband imaging of 83 Hubble Space Telescope (HST) pointings covering 0.203 deg2 toward the SMC, extending out to ∼3.5 kpc in projection from its optical center. Lifetime star formation histories (SFHs) fit to each pointing independently reveal an outside-in age gradient such that fields in the SMC outskirts are older on average. We measure radial gradients of the look-back time to form 90%, 75%, and 50% of the cumulative stellar mass for the first time, finding δ(τ90, τ75, τ50)/δR = (0.61 , , ) Gyr kpc−1 assuming PARSEC evolutionary models and a commonly used elliptical geometry of the SMC, although our results are robust to these assumptions. The wing of the SMC deviates from this trend, forming 25% of its cumulative mass over the most recent 3 Gyr owing to a best-fit star formation rate that remains approximately constant. Our results are consistent with chemodynamical evidence of a tidally stripped SMC component in the foreground and imply contributions to the observed SFH from multiple previous LMC–SMC interactions. We also compare our SMC SFH with results from a companion study of the LMC, finding that while the two galaxies present different internal, spatially resolved SFH trends, both the LMC and SMC have similar near-constant lifetime SFHs when viewed globally.

<div> 关键词: 金属贫乏星，星际震荡，恒星模型，年龄测量，银河形成历史<br />
总结: 本研究报告了发现KIC 8144907，这颗低光度的Kepler红巨星具有高信噪比的振荡，其金属丰度为[Fe/H] = −2.66 ± 0.08，[α/Fe] = 0.38 ± 0.06，这使得它成为迄今为止可以进行详细星际震荡建模的最金属贫乏的恒星。结合Kepler的振荡频谱和高分辨率光谱，测量得到了这颗星的星际质量和年龄，分别为0.79 ± 0.02(ran) ± 0.01(sys) M⊙ 和 12.0 ± 0.6(ran) ± 0.4(sys) Gyr。这些结果表明，恒星模型和星际震荡在金属贫乏恒星的研究中是可靠的。此外，这些结果还为银河早期的形成提供了直接的年龄锚定，表明银河的星体形成直到红移z ≈ 3才开始（如果这颗星是原地形成），或者银河至少经历了约12亿年的并购事件（如果这颗星是通过形成Gaia-Enceladus等矮星体合并而来）。 <br /> <div>
Very-metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] < −2) are important laboratories for testing stellar models and reconstructing the formation history of our galaxy. Asteroseismology is a powerful tool to probe stellar interiors and measure ages, but few asteroseismic detections are known in very-metal-poor stars and none have allowed detailed modeling of oscillation frequencies. We report the discovery of a low-luminosity Kepler red giant (KIC 8144907) with high signal-to-noise ratio oscillations, [Fe/H] = −2.66 ± 0.08 and [α/Fe] = 0.38 ± 0.06, making it by far the most metal-poor star to date for which detailed asteroseismic modeling is possible. By combining the oscillation spectrum from Kepler with high-resolution spectroscopy, we measure an asteroseismic mass and age of 0.79 ± 0.02(ran) ± 0.01(sys) M⊙ and 12.0 ± 0.6(ran) ± 0.4(sys) Gyr, with remarkable agreement across different codes and input physics, demonstrating that stellar models and asteroseismology are reliable for very-metal-poor stars when individual frequencies are used. The results also provide a direct age anchor for the early formation of the Milky Way, implying that substantial star formation did not commence until redshift z ≈ 3 (if the star formed in situ) or that the Milky Way has undergone merger events for at least ≈12 Gyr (if the star was accreted by a dwarf satellite merger such as Gaia-Enceladus).

总结:
本研究利用2.5D完全动力学模拟，研究了帕克太阳探测器观察到的具有非均向性束流的质子速度分布函数的稳定性。研究发现，在具有核心和非均向性束流的构造中，质子束流不稳定性会产生几乎平行的快磁声模式。在不稳定性达到饱和之前，波会与束流质子进行共振相互作用，导致垂直加热以牺牲平行温度。这些发现为太阳风等离子体的行为提供了新的复杂特征。 <div>
The expanding solar wind plasma ubiquitously exhibits anisotropic nonthermal particle velocity distributions. Typically, proton velocity distribution functions (VDFs) show the presence of a core and a field-aligned beam. Novel observations made by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) in the innermost heliosphere have revealed new complex features in the proton VDFs, namely anisotropic beams that sometimes experience perpendicular diffusion. In this study, we use a 2.5D fully kinetic simulation to investigate the stability of proton VDFs with anisotropic beams observed by PSP. Our setup consists of a core and an anisotropic beam population that drift with respect to each other. This configuration triggers a proton beam instability from which nearly parallel fast magnetosonic modes develop. Our results demonstrate that before this instability reaches saturation, the waves resonantly interact with the beam protons, causing perpendicular heating at the expense of the parallel temperature.

<title>Can Supernovae from Runaway Stars Mimic the Signs of Absorbing “Supervirial” Gas?</title>

这篇论文研究了在银河系周围介质中检测到的高度电离气体吸收线现象。研究提出了一种新颖的观点，认为这些观测到的现象可能不是来自于银河系的环绕介质，而是来自于超新星（SN）的恶性排放，这些超新星源于银河盘上方的离子星。研究发现，关联的超新星遗迹中的反冲冲击在早期非辐射相可以将排放物加热到大约10^7K的温度，这可以很自然地解释观测到的高电离气体的高柱密度等现象。然而，来自离子星的超新星的覆盖率仅为0.7%，因此只能解释有限的视线方向的观测现象。 
<br />总结: 检测到银河系周围介质中的高度电离气体吸收线现象；这些现象可能源自于银河盘上方的超新星恶性排放；超新星遗迹中的反冲冲击可以解释这些观测现象；离子星的超新星只能解释有限的视线方向现象。 <div>
The recent detection of large column density absorption lines from highly ionized gas in a few directions through the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way (MW) has been puzzling. The inferred temperature from these absorption lines far exceeds the virial temperature of the MW, and the column densities are also too large to be easily explained. In this paper, we propose a novel idea to explain these observations and claim that they may not have originated from the CGM, but from a totally different type of source, namely, stellar ejecta from supernovae (SNe) above the Galactic disk that happen to lie in the line of sight to the background quasars. About ∼20% of massive OB stars (progenitors of core-collapse supernovae) are known to be runaway stars that have high ejection velocities near the Galactic plane and can end up exploding as SNe above the Galactic disk. We show that the associated reverse shock in the supernova remnant in the early nonradiative phase can heat the ejecta to temperatures of ≳107 K and can naturally explain the observed high column density of ions in the observed “supervirial” phase along with α-enriched supersolar abundance that is typical of core-collapse supernovae. However, SNe from runaway stars has a covering fraction of ≲0.7% and thus can only explain the observations along limited sightlines.

<div> 太阳耀斑，磁场，SDO，太阳活动，重新连接
<br /><br />总结:
研究报道了七个被忽视的狭隘太阳耀斑爆发的例子，这种类型的爆发不符合标准的模型。这些“隐形非标准模型狭隘耀斑爆发”源自太阳黑子。通过SDO的观测，研究者详细追踪了其中两次爆发的过程，并提出了爆发前磁场配置的假设图。研究发现，这些爆发是由于在交叉的内部场线之间的界面上发生突然的重新连接而形成的。这些发现支持了Parker关于太阳日冕磁力线加热的假设。 <div>
We report seven examples of a long-ignored type of confined solar flare eruption that does not fit the standard model for confined flare eruptions. Because they are confined eruptions, do not fit the standard model, and unexpectedly erupt in ostensibly inert magnetic arches, we have named them stealth non-standard-model confined flare eruptions. Each of our flaring magnetic arches stems from a big sunspot. We tracked each eruption in full-cadence UV and EUV images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly of Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) in combination with magnetograms from SDO’s Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager. We present the onset and evolution of two eruptions in detail: one of six that each makes two side-by-side main flare loops, and one that makes two crossed main flare loops. For these two cases, we present cartoons of the proposed pre-eruption field configuration and how sudden reconnection makes the flare ribbons and flare loops. Each of the seven eruptions is consistent with being made by sudden reconnection at an interface between two internal field strands of the magnetic arch, where they cross at a small (10°–20°) angle. These stealth non-standard-model confined flare eruptions therefore plausibly support the idea of E. N. Parker for coronal heating in solar coronal magnetic loops by nanoflare bursts of reconnection at interfaces of internal field strands that cross at angles of 10°–20°.

NGC 602是位于小麦哲伦星系中的一个年轻星团，通过JWST观测到了第一批富含棕矮星候选体（cBD），这些cBD的金属丰度低于太阳，质量在0.05到0.08太阳质量之间。这意味着在非银河系的年轻星团中发现了棕矮星，这一发现对于完善我们对极低金属丰度和年轻年龄下的次太阳质量天体的认识意义重大。需要进一步研究以量化初始质量函数并确认cBD的真实性。这些cBD在空间分布上与主序前恒星位于相同位置。 <div>
We present the discovery of the first rich population of brown dwarf candidates (cBD) at subsolar metallicity, observed by JWST outside the Milky Way (MW) in the young SMC star cluster NGC 602. Located in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) “wing,” in a very low-density environment (1.3 cm−3) and at subsolar metallicity, NGC 602 is very young, with an age of 2–3 Myr. The low stellar density in this star cluster together with JWST NIRCam images in eight filters allowed us to individually resolve and derive accurate photometric measurements for 64 candidate BDs with masses ranging from 0.05 to 0.08 M⊙ or 50 to 84 MJup, according to brown dwarf (BD) evolutionary models. This is the first detection of a young BD population outside the MW. Their spatial distribution indicates that they appear colocated with the pre-main-sequence stars. Although further detailed work is required to quantitatively derive the initial mass function and confirm the true nature of the cBD, this discovery is particularly relevant in the effort to refine our understanding of the subsolar mass function at very low metallicities and young ages.

Over the past three decades, multiple reverberation mapping (RM) campaigns conducted for the quasar PG 2130+099 have exhibited inconsistent findings with time delays ranging from ∼10 to ∼200 days. To achieve a comprehensive understanding of the geometry and dynamics of the broad-line region (BLR) in PG 2130+099, we continued an ongoing high-cadence RM monitoring campaign using the Calar Alto Observatory 2.2 m optical telescope for an extra four years from 2019 to 2022. We measured the time lags of several broad emission lines (including He ii, He i, Hβ, and Fe ii) with respect to the 5100 Å continuum, and their time lags continuously vary through the years. Especially, the Hβ time lags exhibited approximately a factor of 2 increase in the last two years. Additionally, the velocity-resolved time delays of the broad Hβ emission line reveal a back-and-forth change between signs of virial motion and inflow in the BLR. The combination of negligible (∼10%) continuum change and substantial time-lag variation (over 2 times) results in a significant scatter in the intrinsic RHβ–L5100 relationship for PG 2130+099. Taking the consistent changes in the continuum variability time scale and the size of the BLR into account, we tentatively propose that the changes in the measurement of the BLR size may be affected by “geometric dilution”

β Pictoris's well-studied debris disk and two known giant planets, in combination with the stability of the Hubble Space Telescope’s Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (HST/STIS) (and now also JWST), offers a unique opportunity to test planet–disk interaction models and to observe recent planetesimal collisions. We present HST/STIS coronagraphic imaging from two new epochs of data taken between 2021 and 2023, complementing earlier data taken in 1997 and 2012. This data set enables a temporal comparison with the longest baseline and highest precision of any debris disk to date, with sensitivity to variations in temporal surface brightness of sub-percent levels in the midplane of the disk. While no localized changes in surface brightness are detected, which would be indicative of a recent planetesimal collision, there is a tentative brightening of the southeast side of the disk over the past decade. We link the constraints on surface brightness variations to dynamical models of the planetary system’s evolution and to the collisional history of planetesimals. Using a coupled collisional model and injection/recovery framework, we estimate sensitivity to expanding collisional debris down to a Ceres mass per progenitor in the most sensitive regions of the disk midplane. These results demonstrate the capabilities of long-baseline, temporal studies with HST (and also soon with JWST) for constraining the physical processes occurring within debris disks.

总结:
WISEA J171419.96+602724.6是一个极其明亮的2型类星系，通过深度的NuSTAR和XMM-Newton观测发现，该源具有更低的遮挡，但通量减小了约四倍。两次观测表明，该源在不到2.5年的时间内在X射线遮挡、通量和固有光度方面发生了显著的变化。该源是一个红外超亮、受遮挡的星系，其托卢斯中有大量的热尘，并与热、被尘埋没的星系具有许多相似的特性。通过SED拟合发现，该源的辐射率很高，其宿主星系拥有巨大的恒星形成率和星族质量，这与高红移类星体的测量结果一致，并提示该目标的活跃核不会增强或抑制其宿主星系的恒星形成率。 <div>
We present a comprehensive X-ray analysis and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of WISEA J171419.96+602724.6, an extremely luminous type 2 quasar at z = 2.99. The source was suggested as a candidate Compton-thick (column density NH > 1.5×1024 cm−2) quasar by a short XMM-Newton observation in 2011. We recently observed the source with deep NuSTAR and XMM-Newton exposures in 2021 and found that the source has a lower obscuration of NH ∼ 5×1022 cm−2 with an about four times lower flux. The two epochs of observations suggested that the source was significantly variable in X-ray obscuration, flux, and intrinsic luminosity at 2σ–3σ in less than 2.5 yr (in the source rest frame). We performed SED fitting of this source using Code Investigating GALaxy Emission thanks to its great availability of multiwavelength data (from hard X-rays to radio). The source is very luminous, with a bolometric luminosity of LBOL ∼ 2.5 × 1047 erg s−1. Its host galaxy has a huge star formation rate (SFR) of ∼1280 M☉ yr−1 and a huge stellar mass of ∼1.1 × 1012M☉. The correlation between the SFR and stellar mass of this source is consistent with what was measured in the high-z quasars. It is also consistent with what was measured in the main-sequence star-forming galaxies, suggesting that the presence of the active nucleus in our target does not enhance or suppress the SFR of its host galaxy. The source is an infrared hyperluminous, obscured galaxy with a significant amount of hot dust in its torus and shares many similar properties with hot, dust-obscured galaxies.

总结:
太阳黑子和太阳周期间的关系进行了研究。研究表明，过渡期太阳黑子的总面积和总磁通量之间的关系在观测太阳周期的每个阶段似乎变得平坦，并且在太阳周期中没有明显的变化。对于三组太阳黑子，黑子物理参数的平均值及其相关性在太阳周期中只有轻微变化，处于误差范围内。随着平均黑子磁场强度的增加，黑子光强度与磁场强度的相关性也增加。总体而言，过渡期太阳黑子在总面积和总磁通量散点图上的变平与太阳黑子本身的演化有关，并且可能与太阳周期无关。黑子物理参数及其相关性在太阳周期中并没有明显的规律性，这些分析结果有助于更全面地理解太阳黑子磁场的动态过程，为揭示垂直磁通量管的物理特征提供了新的视角。 <div>
To reveal the physical properties of pores and sunspots varying with solar cycle, we carried out a statistical comparison among pores, transitional sunspots, and mature sunspots using Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager from 2010 April to 2023 July. The OTSU method and region-growing algorithm were combined to detect umbrae of 11,876 sunspots covering solar cycles 24 and 25. The relationships between umbral area, continuum intensity (I), line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic field strength (Blos), and line-of-sight velocity (Vlos) of umbrae were investigated in detail. The main conclusions are as follows. (1) The steepness between the total magnetic flux and total area of transitional sunspots appears to be flattened in each phase of the observed solar cycles, and does not have a significant variation over the solar cycle. (2) For three groups of sunspots, the umbral physical parameters’ means and their correlations show only minor variations with the solar cycle, which are in error ranges. (3) As the mean umbral LOS magnetic field strength increases, the correlation of the umbral I–Blos increases. The flattening of transitional sunspots in total area–total magnetic flux scatter is related to the evolution of sunspots itself, and may not correspond to the solar cycle. The umbral physical parameters and their correlations do not exhibit a discernible regularity over the solar cycle. Our analysis results contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamic processes of sunspot magnetic fields and give a new perspective on revealing the physical features of vertical magnetic flux tubes.

冷星际分子气体的形状由多种过程决定，包括自引力、潮汐力、湍流、磁场和星系剪切。本研究利用Vergely等人推导的3D尘埃消光图，识别出银河盘3 kpc范围内550个分子云的样本。我们的样本包含从帕秒到千秒不等大小的云，可以用来研究星系尺度过程（如剪切）对云的演化的影响。我们发现，样本云遵循幂律质量-大小关系，其中R是基于主轴的云半径，RS是基于面积的半径，RV是基于体积的半径。这些云具有平均表面密度约为7 M⊙ pc^-2，并遵循体密度-大小关系。随着云的大小增加，它们的形状逐渐从椭球状过渡到盘状，再过渡到棒状结构。大型云倾向于具有28°-45°的螺距角，在此角度是相对于银河的切线方向测量的。这些巨大云也倾向于与银河盘面平行，并受到星系分子气体盘的限制。我们的结果表明，银河系中的大型分子云可被银河剪切塑造，并在垂直方向上受到重力的约束。<br /><br />总结: 本研究利用尘埃消光图，在银河盘3 kpc范围内识别了550个分子云的样本。样本云遵循幂律质量-大小关系，平均表面密度约为7 M⊙ pc^-2，并遵循体密度-大小关系。随着云的大小增加，它们的形状逐渐从椭球状过渡到盘状，再过渡到棒状结构。大型云倾向于具有28°-45°的螺距角，并倾向于与银河盘面平行，并受到星系分子气体盘的限制。这些结果表明，银河系中的大型分子云可以被银河剪切塑造，并在垂直方向上受到重力的约束。 <div>
The shape of the cold interstellar molecular gas is determined by several processes, including self-gravity, tidal force, turbulence, magnetic field, and galactic shear. Based on the 3D dust extinction map derived by Vergely et al., we identify a sample of 550 molecular clouds within 3 kpc of the solar vicinity in the Galactic disk. Our sample contains clouds whose size ranges from parsec to kiloparsec, which enables us to study the effect of Galactic-scale processes, such as shear, on cloud evolution. We find that our sample clouds follow a power-law mass–size relation of , , and , where is the major axis-based cloud radius, RS is the area-based radius, and RV is the volume-based radius, respectively. These clouds have a mean constant surface density of ∼7 M⊙ pc−2 and follow a volume density–size relation of . As cloud size increases, their shapes gradually transition from ellipsoidal to disk-like to bar-like structures. Large clouds tend to have a pitch angle of 28°−45°, where the angle is measured concerning the Galactic tangential direction. These giant clouds also tend to stay parallel to the Galactic disk plane and are confined within the Galactic molecular gas disk. Our results show that large molecular clouds in the Milky Way can be shaped by Galactic shear and confined in the vertical direction by gravity.

We present a proof-of-concept simulation-based inference on Ωm and σ8 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) LOWZ Northern Galactic Cap (NGC) catalog using neural networks and domain generalization techniques without the need of summary statistics. Using rapid light-cone simulations L-picola, mock galaxy catalogs are produced that fully incorporate the observational effects. The collection of galaxies is fed as input to a point cloud-based network, Minkowski-PointNet. We also add relatively more accurate Gadget mocks to obtain robust and generalizable neural networks. By explicitly learning the representations that reduce the discrepancies between the two different data sets via the semantic alignment loss term, we show that the latent space configuration aligns into a single plane in which the two cosmological parameters form clear axes. Consequently, during inference, the SDSS BOSS LOWZ NGC catalog maps onto the plane, demonstrating effective generalization and improving prediction accuracy compared to non-generalized models. Results from the ensemble of 25 independently trained machines find Ωm = 0.339 ± 0.056 and σ8 = 0.801 ± 0.061, inferred only from the distribution of galaxies in the light-cone slices without relying on any indirect summary statistics. A single machine that best adapts to the Gadget mocks yields a tighter prediction of Ωm = 0.282 ± 0.014 and σ8 = 0.786 ± 0.036. We emphasize that adaptation across multiple domains can enhance the robustness of the neural networks in observational data.

<div> 关键词: 21 cm实验宇宙学, 射电望远镜, 计算电磁学模拟, MEDEA模拟器, 光束超参数

总结: 
21 cm实验宇宙学中，准确表征射电望远镜的天线光束响应对于测量21 cm信号至关重要。为了优化天线设计或准确表示光束，需要进行光束模式和频率响应的计算电磁学模拟。然而，搜索所有可能的参数空间以优化天线设计或准确代表光束是计算上昂贵的。因此，研究人员提出了MEDEA模拟器，它能够快速而准确地在广阔的超参数空间内生成远场辐射模式。MEDEA采用CEM软件模拟的一部分光束，将其空间分解成完整的线性基础上的系数，然后插值形成任意超参数的新光束。研究人员对一个解析偶极子和两个数字光束进行测试，并将MEDEA作为模型用于拟合模拟射电分光计数据以提取输入光束超参数的协方差。他们发现，利用20个或更少的输入光束，插值光束的均方根相对误差最多为10^-2，并且拟合模拟数据能够恢复输入光束超参数。当在模拟数据中引入系统偏差时，提取的光束超参数会出现偏差，这是预期的。他们提出了MEDEA的一些扩展来解决这种偏差。 <div>
In 21 cm experimental cosmology, accurate characterization of a radio telescope’s antenna beam response is essential to measure the 21 cm signal. Computational electromagnetic (CEM) simulations estimate the antenna beam pattern and frequency response by subjecting the EM model to different dependencies, or beam hyperparameters, such as soil dielectric constant or orientation with the environment. However, it is computationally expensive to search all possible parameter spaces to optimize the antenna design or accurately represent the beam to the level required for use as a systematic model in 21 cm cosmology. We therefore present the Model for Emulating Directivities and Electric fields of Antennas (MEDEA), an emulator that rapidly and accurately generates far-field radiation patterns over a large hyperparameter space. MEDEA takes a subset of beams simulated by CEM software, spatially decomposes them into coefficients on a complete, linear basis, and then interpolates them to form new beams at arbitrary hyperparameters. We test MEDEA on an analytical dipole and two numerical beams motivated by upcoming lunar lander missions, and then employ MEDEA as a model to fit mock radio spectrometer data to extract covariances on the input beam hyperparameters. We find that the interpolated beams have rms relative errors of at most 10−2 using 20 input beams or less, and that fits to mock data are able to recover the input beam hyperparameters when the model and mock are derived from the same set of beams. When a systematic bias is introduced into the mock data, extracted beam hyperparameters exhibit bias, as expected. We propose several extensions to MEDEA to potentially account for such bias.

<div> 关键词: broad-line region (BLR), radio-quiet (RQ) active galactic nuclei (AGN), parsec scales, radio emission, Eddington ratios

总结:<br /><br />这项研究探讨了RQ活动星系核中的广谱线区域（BLR）风是否延伸到秒差距尺度并产生无线电发射。研究发现具有无线电和BLR风指标的对象在高Eddington比率（L/LEdd≥0.66）处，并且大部分既没有无线电也没有BLR风指标的对象处于低Eddington比率（L/LEdd≤0.28）处。这表明RQ AGN中的BLR风和无线电风与辐射压力驱动的风有关。研究还发现两个对象中存在AGN光电离气体的自由–自由吸收迹象，三个低Eddington比率（0.05–0.12）对象的无线电流出可能来自低功率喷流，四个中等Eddington比率（0.2–0.4）对象中存在温和的赤道BLR风。未来的光谱偏振测量可以验证这一点。 <div>
Does a broad-line region (BLR) wind in radio-quiet (RQ) active galactic nuclei (AGN) extend to parsec scales and produce radio emission? We explore the correlations between a parsec-scale radio wind and the BLR wind in a sample of 19 RQ Palomar–Green quasars. The radio wind is defined based on the spectral slope and the compactness of the emission at 1.5–5 GHz, and the BLR wind is defined by the excess blue wing in the C iv emission line profile. The five objects with both radio and BLR wind indicators are found at high Eddington ratios, L/LEdd (≥0.66), and eight of the nine objects with neither radio nor BLR winds reside at low L/LEdd (≤0.28). This suggests that the BLR wind and the radio wind in RQ AGN are related to a radiation-pressure-driven wind. Evidence for free–free absorption by AGN photoionized gas, which flattens the spectral slope, is found in two objects. Radio outflows in three low-L/LEdd (0.05–0.12) objects are likely from a low-power jet, as suggested by additional evidence. The presence of a mild equatorial BLR wind in four intermediate-L/LEdd (0.2–0.4) objects can be tested with future spectropolarimetry.

<div> 搜索、脉冲星候选、银河系、MeerKAT射电望远镜、偏振
总结:
本研究利用MeerKAT射电望远镜的图像进行了对银河系中心区域的脉冲星候选的搜索，使用了多种标准来选择候选脉冲星。结果显示出75个偏振源，其中28个和明亮恒星或年轻恒星对象相关。对已知脉冲星进行偏振发射的搜索结果表明了这一技术的有效性。通过比较这些候选源的属性，确定了30个有希望进行脉冲星脉冲跟踪的候选源。有两个源同时具有较强的圆偏振和线偏振。剩下的17个源可能是脉冲星或恒星，但也不能排除是星系外来源或图像伪迹的可能。 <div>
We report on the results of an image-based search for pulsar candidates toward the Galactic bulge. We used mosaic images from the MeerKAT radio telescope that were taken as part of a 173 deg2 survey of the bulge and Galactic center of our Galaxy at L band (856–1712 MHz) in all four Stokes I, Q, U, and V. The image rms noise levels of 12–17 μJy ba−1 represent a significant increase in sensitivity over past image-based pulsar searches. Our primary search criterion was circular polarization, but we used other criteria, including linear polarization, in-band spectral index, compactness, variability, and multiwavelength counterparts to select pulsar candidates. We first demonstrate the efficacy of this technique by searching for polarized emission from known pulsars and comparing our results with measurements from the literature. Our search resulted in a sample of 75 polarized sources. Bright stars or young stellar objects were associated with 28 of these sources, including a small sample of highly polarized dwarf stars with pulsar-like steep spectra. Comparing the properties of this sample with the known pulsars, we identified 30 compelling candidates for pulsation follow-up, including two sources with both strong circular and linear polarization. The remaining 17 sources are either pulsars or stars, but we cannot rule out an extragalactic origin or image artifacts among the brighter, flat-spectrum objects.

<div> 关键词: 非热展宽, 磁场, 视线, 运动, 太阳光谱
总结: 
本文通过观察太阳活跃区的Si iv 1403 Å光谱，发现非热展宽与磁场与观察者视线方向的对齐有关，并且与向下运动（红移）呈正相关。根据这些观察结果，作者推测磁场方向与观察者视线方向一致时，沿着磁场下流的等离子体速度梯度可能导致闭合场区域中过渡区光谱线的非热展宽。这一发现有助于解答太阳光谱中非热展宽的物理过程。 <div>
The origin of nonthermal broadening in solar spectra is one of the long-standing questions in solar physics. Various processes have been invoked—including unresolved flows, waves, and turbulent processes—but definitive answers are lacking. To investigate the physical processes responsible for nonthermal broadening, we examine its relation with the angle between the magnetic field and the line of sight in three different closed-field regions above plage regions at different locations on the solar disk. We obtained the nonthermal width of transition-region Si iv 1403 Å spectra observed in active regions by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, after subtraction of the thermal and instrumental line broadening. To investigate the dependence of the measured broadening on the viewing angle between the line of sight and magnetic field direction, we determined the magnetic field direction at transition-region heights using nonlinear force-free extrapolations based on the observed photospheric vector magnetic field taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. We found that the nonthermal broadening shows a correlation with downward motion (redshifts) and alignment between the magnetic field and the observer’s line-of-sight direction. Based on the observed correlations, we suggest that velocity gradients within plasma flowing down along the magnetic field may lead to a significant portion of the observed nonthermal broadening of transition-region spectral lines in closed fields above plage regions.

Large area observations of extragalactic deep fields with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have provided a wealth of candidate low-mass L- and T-class brown dwarfs. The existence of these sources, which are at derived distances of hundreds of parsecs to several kiloparsecs from the Sun, has strong implications for the low-mass end of the stellar initial mass function, and the link between stars and planets at low metallicities. In this letter, we present a JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectrum of brown dwarf JADES-GS-BD-9, confirming its photometric selection from observations taken as part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program. Fits to this spectrum indicate that the brown dwarf has an effective temperature of 800–900 K (T5–T6) at a distance of 1.8–2.3 kpc from the Sun, with evidence of the source being at low metallicity ([M/H] ≤ −0.5). Finally, because of the cadence of JADES NIRCam observations of this source, we additionally uncover a proper motion between the 2022 and 2023 centroids, and we measure a proper motion of 20 ± 4 mas yr−1 (a transverse velocity of 214 km s−1 at 2.25 kpc). At this predicted metallicity, distance, and transverse velocity, it is likely that this source belongs either to the edge of the Milky Way thick disk or the galactic halo. This spectral confirmation demonstrates the efficacy of photometric selection of these important sources across deep extragalactic JWST imaging.

总结: 最近的研究表明，来自相对论等离子体的同步辐射会导致电子分布在动量空间中形成一个各向异性的环状结构，并且容易受到动力学和流体不稳定性的影响。本文研究了等离子体光学厚度增加时这些不稳定性的行为。我们将最近发展的用于轻度相对论等离子体中同步辐射和吸收的Fokker–Planck算子推广到了超相对论等离子体。对于给定的等离子体参数，由高能电子发射的光子往往具有更高的频率，因此更容易逃离等离子体。因此，对于给定的电子来说，光子发射率（辐射阻力）与吸收率（辐射扩散）的比率极大地依赖于能量。考虑到这种行为，我们确定了控制光学厚度的临界参数，并展示了等离子体如何在更高的光学厚度下逐渐过渡为更各向同性和更稳定的状态。 <div>
Recent work has shown that synchrotron emission from relativistic plasmas leads the electron distribution to form an anisotropic ring in momentum space, which can be unstable to both kinetic and hydrodynamic instabilities. Fundamental to these works was the assumption that the plasma was optically thin, allowing all emitted radiation to escape. Here, we examine the behavior of these instabilities as the plasma becomes more optically thick. To do this, we extend a recently developed Fokker–Planck operator for synchrotron emission and absorption in mildly relativistic plasmas to ultrarelativistic plasmas. For a given set of plasma parameters, photons emitted by higher-energy electrons tend to be higher frequency, and thus more easily escape the plasma. As a result, the ratio of the photon emission rate (radiative drag) to absorption rate (radiative diffusion) for a given electron is extremely energy dependent. Given this behavior, we determine the critical parameters that control the opacity, and show how the plasma gradually transitions to become more isotropic and stable at higher opacity.

Recent works have constrained the binary fraction of evolved populations of massive stars in local galaxies such as red supergiants and Wolf–Rayet stars, but the binary fraction of yellow supergiants (YSGs) in the Hertzsprung gap remains unconstrained. Binary evolution theory predicts that the Hertzsprung gap is home to multiple populations of binary systems with varied evolutionary histories. In this paper, we develop a method to distinguish single YSGs from YSG plus O- or B-type main-sequence binaries using optical and ultraviolet photometry, and then apply this method to identify candidate YSG binaries in the Magellanic Clouds. After constructing a set of combined stellar atmosphere models, we find that optical photometry is, given typical measurement and reddening uncertainties, sufficient to discern single YSGs from YSG+OB binaries if the OB-star is at least ∼5M⊙ for Teff,YSG ∼ 4000 K, but requires a ∼20M⊙ OB star for YSGs up to Teff,YSG ∼ 9000 K. For these hotter YSG temperatures, ultraviolet photometry allows binaries with OB companions as small as ∼7M⊙ to be identified. We use color–color spaces developed from these models to search for evidence of excess blue or ultraviolet light in a set of ∼1000 YSG candidates in the Magellanic Clouds. We identify hundreds of candidate YSG binary systems and report a preliminary fraction of YSGs that show a blue/UV color excess of 20%–60%. Spectroscopic follow-up is now required to confirm the true nature of this population.

这项研究利用GIZMO模拟代码构建了一个富含气体的Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus(GSE)合并模型，成功地重现了盘状星系的弯曲，并捕捉了几乎所有已知特征。模拟结果表明，单次重大合并可能产生银河盘的弯曲幅度和进动。此外，对弯曲的长期演化的分析可能为银河系的形成历史提供更多线索。 <div>
Previous studies have revealed that the Galactic warp is a long-lived, nonsteady, and asymmetric structure. There is a need for a model that accounts for the warp’s long-term evolution. Given that this structure has persisted for over 5 Gyr, its timeline may coincide with the completion of the Gaia–Sausage–Enceladus (GSE) merger. Recent studies indicate that the GSE, the significant merger of our Galaxy, was likely a gas-rich merger and the large amount of gas introduced could have created a profound impact on the Galactic morphology. This study utilizes GIZMO simulation code to construct a gas-rich GSE merger. By reconstructing the observed characteristics of the GSE, we successfully reproduce the disk warp and capture nearly all of its documented features, which align closely with observational data from both stellar and gas disks. This simulation demonstrates the possibility that a single major merger could generate the Galactic warp amplitude and precession. Furthermore, the analysis of the warp’s long-term evolution may offer more clues into the formation history of the Milky Way.

The origin of water and volatile compounds on planets including Earth is a hotly debated topic in planetary science. For example, many dynamic models suggest that the majority of Earth’s water and volatile elements were added from an external source. The stellar wind irradiation of rocky oxygen-containing minerals results in a reaction between H+ ions and silicate minerals to produce water and OH, which could explain the presence of water in the regoliths of airless worlds such as the Moon, as well as the water abundances in asteroids. Here, we used the method of high-resolution infrared spectrometry and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) with mass detection to observe and for the first time quantify water formation on the surfaces of oxygen-bearing minerals. We tested 14 different mineral and natural samples and observed the formation of water on their surfaces upon exposure to H+ or D+ irradiation. The samples, including two meteorite samples (RAS 445 and SAU 567), were shown to have a water adsorption capacity between 0.09 and 0.7 wt%. The adsorbed water (likely dissociatively adsorbed) remains on the surface at pressures as low as 10−9 mbar (in the TPD experiment) and temperatures as high as 600 K, which suggests a possible transfer over long distances and timescales. Our article has a general character and demonstrates that any interaction of oxygen-containing minerals with stellar radiation (H+ ions) leads to the generation of water adsorbed on the surface of the minerals. The case of the origin of water on Earth is taken as a prime example.

该研究利用NICER观测数据对MAXI J1803−298在整个2021年的持续爆发过程进行了研究。在中间态和软态中，我们检测到了显著的吸收线，约为7.0和6.7keV，这些吸收线是来自X射线盘风，在我们的视线上以数百km/s的速度向外流动。根据光电离模型的拟合结果，我们发现这些风是受热压力驱动的，质量流失率较低。我们发现铁在中间态到软态转变期间从主要的H样变为主要的He样，这一转变是由于照明光谱的演变和盘风几何特性的缓慢变化引起的。我们还报告了在中间态中存在盘风和准周期振荡特征的共存现象。该研究使MAXI J1803−298成为首个检测到光学风向X射线风转变的源，为了解整个爆发期间盘风的演化和黑洞吸积盘和质量流出的长期耦合提供了新的见解。

We present the results from the NICER observation data of MAXI J1803−298 across the entire 2021 outburst. In the intermediate and soft state, we detect significant absorption lines at ∼7.0 and ∼6.7 keV, arising from X-ray disk winds outflowing with a velocity of hundreds of km s−1 along our line of sight. The fitting results from the photoionized model suggest that the winds are driven by thermal pressure and the mass-loss rate is low. We find a clear transition for iron from predominantly H-like to predominantly He-like during the intermediate-to-soft state transition. Our results indicate this transition for iron is caused by the evolution of the illuminating spectrum and the slow change of the geometric properties of the disk winds together. The coexistence of disk winds and quasiperiodic oscillation features in the intermediate state is also reported. Our study makes MAXI J1803−298 the first source in which a transition from optical winds to X-ray winds is detected, offering new insights into the evolution of disk winds across an entire outburst and long-term coupling of accretion disks and mass outflows around accreting black holes.

The present study has investigated the statistical distribution of the current sheet width across the reconnection diffusion region by means of the 3D particle-in-cell simulations. The 3D reconnection layers are unstable to the flow shear instabilities, which results in electromagnetic (EM) turbulence generating effective magnetic dissipation around the x-line. The simulations are performed for several ion-to-electron mass ratios and computational domain sizes, which determine the fastest-growing mode in each simulation run. When the turbulence is weak, the current sheet width increases with the turbulence intensity, following a theoretical curve independent of the mass ratio and domain size. However, when the turbulence is stronger, the width saturates at a low level around 2 times the local electron inertia length, i.e., much smaller than the ion kinetic scales. It is found that the intense inductive electric field due to the EM turbulence is partly canceled out by the eddy viscous effect. As a result, the reconnection electric field is almost unchanged during the quasi-steady phase, regardless of the turbulence intensity. The result implies that the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence models are unlikely to be applicable to the reconnection diffusion region.

<div> 关键词: 外行星大气检索, 假设, 水汽剖面, 云, 观测数据

总结: 本研究利用先进的检索框架探讨了假设外行星大气中垂直分子丰度恒定和无云层对外行星性质表征的影响。首先在模拟的地球1D中红外光谱上验证了不同的检索模型，然后对真实的地球中红外光谱进行了分析。研究发现，对H2O丰度和云层的假设直接影响对地球特征的提取。根据观测数据，使用物理合理的H2O剖面和云模型进行的检索效果更佳，能够准确估计地球的半径、压力-温度结构以及CO2、H2O和O3的丰度，并且在R = 100时，可以可靠且无偏倚地检测CH4等生物标志物。因此，本研究建议在温带外行星大气的检索中使用多样的模型，以建立对不同检索假设对外行星光谱解释的影响的理解，从而能够利用未来的空间仪器对遥远的宜居世界进行表征和寻找生命。 <br /><br /> <div>
Atmospheric retrievals are widely used to constrain exoplanet properties from observed spectra. We investigate how the common nonphysical retrieval assumptions of vertically constant molecule abundances and cloud-free atmospheres affect our characterization of an exo-Earth (an Earth-twin orbiting a Sun-like star). Specifically, we use a state-of-the-art retrieval framework to explore how assumptions for the H2O profile and clouds affect retrievals. In the first step, we validate different retrieval models on a low-noise simulated 1D mid-infrared (MIR) spectrum of Earth. Thereafter, we study how these assumptions affect the characterization of Earth with the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE). We run retrievals on LIFE mock observations based on real disk-integrated MIR Earth spectra. The performance of different retrieval models is benchmarked against ground truths derived from remote sensing data. We show that assumptions for the H2O abundance and clouds directly affect our characterization. Overall, retrievals that use physically motivated models for the H2O profile and clouds perform better on the empirical Earth data. For observations of Earth with LIFE, they yield accurate estimates for the radius, pressure–temperature structure, and the abundances of CO2, H2O, and O3. Further, at R = 100, a reliable and bias-free detection of the biosignature CH4 becomes feasible. We conclude that the community must use a diverse range of models for temperate exoplanet atmospheres to build an understanding of how different retrieval assumptions can affect the interpretation of exoplanet spectra. This will enable the characterization of distant habitable worlds and the search for life with future space-based instruments.

<div> MaNGA, resolved spectroscopy, galaxies, star formation, quenched regions
<br /><br />总结:
该研究利用MaNGA的解析光谱对银河系的局部和整体性质进行了调查，以探究kpc尺度上星体形成停止的重要性。研究通过一个单参数标准Dn(4000) - EW(Hα)来识别隔离的盘状星系中的停星区域，并根据冷气体表面密度Σgas将其划分为富气体停星区域（GRQRs）和贫气体停星区域。这两种类型的停星区域往往位于非AGN星系中，具有相对较高的质量（M* ≳ 1010 M⊙）和红色（NUV − r ≳ 3），以及低的星体形成率和固定质量时的高中心密度。他们在其他性质上的范围很广，包括结构参数，与母样本相似，表明导致富气体区域停星的条件在很大程度上独立于星系的整体性质。我们对我们的样本进行了随机森林分类器和回归器的训练，用于预测在15个局部/整体性质中的停星现象。Σ*是停星的最重要性质，尤其是对于GRQRs来说。这些结果强烈表明了低质量的热演化星体的重要作用，这些星体在停星区域中数量众多且寿命长，可以给周围气体提供实质的辐射压力，来抵制重力坍缩。以前A.F.L.Bluck等人发现的停星的不同功能重要性，在一定程度上是由于对停星区域的不同定义，特别是对EW(Hα)的不同要求。 <div>
We use resolved spectroscopy from MaNGA to investigate the significance of both local and global properties of galaxies to the cessation of star formation at kpc scales. Quenched regions are identified from a sample of isolated disk galaxies by a single-parameter criterion Dn(4000) - EW(Hα) , and are divided into gas-rich quenched regions (GRQRs) and gas-poor quenched regions according to the surface density of cold gas (Σgas). Both types of quenched regions tend to be hosted by non-AGN galaxies with relatively high mass (M* ≳ 1010 M⊙) and red colors (NUV − r ≳ 3), as well as low star formation rate and high central density at fixed mass. They span wide ranges in other properties including structural parameters that are similar to the parent sample, indicating that the conditions responsible for quenching in gas-rich regions are largely independent of the global properties of galaxies. We train random forest classifiers and regressors for predicting quenching in our sample with 15 local/global properties. Σ* is the most important property for quenching, especially for GRQRs. These results strongly indicate the important roles of low-mass hot evolved stars, which are numerous and long-lived in quenched regions and can provide substantial radiation pressure to support the surrounding gas against gravitational collapse. The different feature importance for quenching, as found previously by A. F. L. Bluck et al., is partly due to the different definitions of quenched regions, particularly the different requirements on EW(Hα).

总结: 
在现代长基线干涉仪收集的数据中搜索连续波引力辐射需要大量的存储空间。该论文描述了一种数字化方案，将64位干涉仪输出减少到一个或两个比特的数据流，同时最小化失真，并实现存储和输入/输出成本的大幅降低。对于代表性的最大似然匹配滤波器，通过蒙特卡洛模拟发现，在高斯噪声中，注入信号仅需要比64位信号强约24%（对于一比特数据）和强约6.4%（对于具有最佳门限的两比特数据）即可以90%的概率被检测到。当信号频率逐渐降低或噪声统计不是高斯时，上述百分比几乎不会发生显著变化，在LIGO第六次科学运行数据的验证中也得到了证实。 <div>
Searches for continuous-wave gravitational radiation in data collected by modern long-baseline interferometers, such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), the Virgo interferometer, and the Kamioka Gravitational Wave Detector, can be memory intensive. A digitization scheme is described that reduces the 64-bit interferometer output to a one- or two-bit data stream while minimizing distortion and achieving considerable reduction in storage and input/output cost. For the representative example of the coherent, maximum-likelihood matched filter known as the -statistic, it is found using Monte Carlo simulations that the injected signal only needs to be ≈24% stronger (for one-bit data) and ≈6.4% stronger (for two-bit data with optimal thresholds) than a 64-bit signal in order to be detected with 90% probability in Gaussian noise. The foregoing percentages do not change significantly when the signal frequency decreases secularly, or when the noise statistics are not Gaussian, as verified with LIGO Science Run 6 data.

<div> 关键词: 高能宇宙射线电子、能量损失率、红移、气体表面密度、高红移星系<br />
总结: 本研究建立了一个简单的参数模型来描述无线电和红外辐射之间的相关性，考虑了高能宇宙射线电子的能量损失率，包括辐射冷却、电离和绝热膨胀等过程。对每个能量损失过程进行了计算和比较，将每个过程的能量损失率重新写成与气体表面密度和红移的相关比列关系。通过结合每个能量损失率，计算了辐射冷却的能量损失率在气体表面密度和红移上的比例，将局部建立的qIR值重新表达为与红移和气体表面密度相关，并应用于理解I. Delvecchio等人研究中高红移星系的观察到的无线电-红外相关性分布。我们的模型预测，qIR值与气体表面密度呈反相关，并且qIR值的红移依赖性受到星系气体表面密度的影响，捕捉了以恒星质量为选择标准的星形成星系的qIR值观测趋势，减少了无线电-红外选择偏差的影响。<br /><br /> <div>
We introduce a simple parametric model of the radio–infrared correlation (i.e., the ratio between the IR luminosity and the 1.4 GHz radio luminosity, qIR) by considering the energy loss rate of high-energy cosmic-ray (CR) electrons governed by radiative cooling (synchrotron, bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton scattering), ionization, and adiabatic expansion. Each process of CR electron energy loss is explicitly computed and compared to each other. We rewrite the energy loss rate of each process to be dependent on the gas surface density and redshift using the relevant scaling relations. By combining each energy loss rate, the fraction of the synchrotron energy loss rate is computed as a function of gas surface density and redshift and used to extrapolate the well-established “local” radio–infrared correlation to the high-redshift Universe. The locally established qIR is reformulated to be dependent upon the redshift and the gas surface density and applied for understanding the observed distribution of the radio–infrared correlation of high-redshift galaxies in I. Delvecchio et al. Our model predicts that the qIR value is anticorrelated with gas surface density and the redshift dependency of the qIR value changes by the gas surface density of galaxies, which captures the observed trend of qIR values for stellar-mass-selected star-forming galaxies with a minimal impact of radio–infrared selection bias.

<div> 关键词: 外行星, 大气成分, 行星参数, 岩浆, 化学平衡
总结:<br /><br />这项研究考察了外行星大气中氢、氧和碳的依赖关系，并基于行星参数和岩浆特性进行了分析。研究结果表明，在类地行星的全熔岩石内部，大气中H2O的分数约为10^(-2)-10^(-1)，而C/H则仅在大气压力≲1000 bar和H2O分数≳10%时才会略微增加。此外，在氧化大气条件下，C/O比会下降到nebula气体值的十分之一以下，可能为岩石内部和内源水提供了证据。研究还强调了对高压物质特性的约束对解释膨胀行星的岩浆-大气相互作用的重要性。 <div>
Most exoplanets with a few Earth radii are more inflated than bare-rock planets with the same mass, indicating a substantial volatile amount. Neither the origin of the volatiles nor the planet’s bulk composition can be constrained from the mass–radius relation alone, and the spectral characterization of their atmospheres is needed to solve this degeneracy. Previous studies showed that chemical interaction between accreted volatile and possible molten rocky surface (i.e., magma ocean) can greatly affect the atmospheric composition. However, a variety in the atmospheric compositions of such planets with different properties remains elusive. In this work, we examine the dependence of atmospheric H, O, and C on planetary parameters (atmospheric thickness, planetary mass, equilibrium temperature, and magma properties such as redox state) assuming nebula gas accretion on an Earth-like core, using an atmosphere-magma chemical equilibrium model. Consistent with previous work, we show that atmospheric H2O fraction on a fully molten rocky interior with an Earth-like redox state is on the order of 10−2–10−1 regardless of other planetary parameters. Despite the solubility difference between H- and C-bearing species, C/H increases only a few times above the nebula value except for atmospheric pressure ≲1000 bar and H2O fraction ≳10%. This results in a negative O/H–C/O trend and depleted C/O below one-tenth of the nebula gas value under an oxidized atmosphere, which could provide a piece of evidence of rocky interior and endogenic water. We also highlight the importance of constraints on the high-pressure material properties for interpreting the magma–atmospheric interaction of inflated planets.

In this paper, we calculate the energy, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), detection range, and angular anisotropy of the matter, matter memory, and neutrino memory gravitational-wave (GW) signatures of 21 three-dimensional initially nonrotating core-collapse supernova (CCSN) models carried to late times. We find that inferred energy, SNR, and detection range are angle-dependent quantities, and that the spread of possible energy, signal to noise, and detection ranges across all viewing angles generally increases with progenitor mass. When examining the low-frequency matter memory and neutrino memory components of the signal, we find that the neutrino memory is the most detectable component of a CCSN GW signal, and that DECIGO is best equipped to detect both matter memory and neutrino memory. Moreover, we find that the polarization angle between the h+ and h× strains serves as a unique identifier of matter and neutrino memory. Finally, we develop a Galactic density- and stellar mass-weighted formalism to calculate the rate at which we can expect to detect CCSN GW signals with the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (aLIGO). When considering only the matter component of the signal, the aLIGO detection rate is around 65% of the total Galactic supernova rate, but increases to 90% when incorporating the neutrino memory component. We find that all future detectors (Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer, DECIGO) will be able to detect CCSN GW signals from the entire Galaxy, and for the higher-mass progenitors even into the Local Group of galaxies.

The stellar shells surrounding an elliptical galaxy, as remnants of a dwarf galaxy disrupted during merging, reveal the distribution of energy and angular momentum of the progenitor dwarf galaxy. We develop a semi-analytical model to describe the changes in energy ΔEi and angular momentum ΔLzi for particles during the first infall. We show that these changes, induced by the self-gravity of the progenitor, are important in broadening the initial energy distribution of the Plummer or Hernquist progenitor model. Consequently, these changes are crucial in shaping the shells. In the freefall stage following the disintegration of the progenitor potential, particles are no longer bound by self-gravity but move within the gravitational potential of the target galaxy. We investigate the relationship between the radial period and the energy of particles undergoing radial motion. We show that an accurate model of the energy range of the dwarf galaxy at disruption is essential to predict the number of observable shells.

Oscillatory reconnection is a specific type of time-dependent reconnection which involves periodic changes in the magnetic topology of a null point. The mechanism has been reported for a variety of magnetic field strengths and configurations, background temperatures, and densities. All these studies report an oscillation in the current density at the null point, but also report a variety of periods, amplitudes, and overall behaviors. We conduct a parametric study for equilibrium magnetic field strength and initial background temperature, solving two-dimensional resistive magnetohydrodynamic equations around a magnetic X-point. We introduce a parameter space for the ratio of internal to magnetic energy and find self-similar solutions for simulations where this ratio is below 0.1 (which represents a magnetically dominated environment or, equivalently, a low-beta plasma). Self-similarity can be seen in oscillations in the current density at the null (including amplitude and period), ohmic heating, and the temperature generated via reconnection jets. The parameter space of energy ratios also allows us to contextualize previous studies of the oscillatory reconnection mechanism and bring those different studies together into a single unified understanding.

Due to the unprecedented signal strengths offered by the newest high-resolution spectrographs on 10 m class telescopes, exploring the 3D nature of exoplanets is possible with an unprecedented level of precision. In this paper, we present a new technique to probe the vertical structure of exoplanetary winds and dynamics using ensembles of planet absorption lines of varying opacity, and apply it to the well-studied ultrahot Jupiter WASP-76b. We then compare these results to state-of-the-art global circulation models (GCMs) with varying magnetic drag prescriptions. We find that the known asymmetric velocity shift in Fe i absorption during transit persists at all altitudes, and observe tentative trends for stronger blueshifts and more narrow line profiles deeper in the atmosphere. By comparing three different model prescriptions (a hydrodynamical model with no drag, a magnetic drag model, and a uniform drag model) we are able to rule out the uniform drag model due to inconsistencies with observed trends in the data. We find that the magnetic model is slightly favored over the the hydrodynamic model, and note that this 3-Gauss kinematic magnetohydrodynamical GCM is also favored when compared to low-resolution data. Future generation high-resolution spectrographs on extremely large telescopes will greatly increase signals and make methods like these possible with higher precision and for a wider range of objects.

太空天气的实时监测和警报系统的需求在过去20年显著增长。预测太阳质子事件（SPEs）是太空任务运营和规划中最重要的挑战之一。人工智能和机器学习技术在统计预测算法方面开辟了新的领域。大多数模型旨在预测SPE的发生，即它们基于分类方法。这项工作旨在成功实施机载预测系统，这对于未来的太空探索至关重要。作者提出了一种简单高效的机器学习回归算法，能够利用仅来自电子通量的特征，预测未来1小时的高能质子通量。这种方法有助于改进深空和近地环境辐射风险监测系统。该模型对于任务运营和规划非常重要，特别是当耀斑特征和来源位置在实时不可用时，例如在火星距离上。 <br /><br /> <div>
The need for real-time monitoring and alerting systems for space weather hazards has grown significantly in the last two decades. One of the most important challenges for space mission operations and planning is the prediction of solar proton events (SPEs). In this context, artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques have opened a new frontier, providing a new paradigm for statistical forecasting algorithms. The great majority of these models aim to predict the occurrence of an SPE, i.e., they are based on the classification approach. This work is oriented toward the successful implementation of onboard prediction systems, which is essential for the future of space exploration. We present a simple and efficient machine learning regression algorithm that is able to forecast the energetic proton flux up to 1 hr ahead by exploiting features derived from the electron flux only. This approach could be helpful in improving monitoring systems of the radiation risk in both deep space and near-Earth environments. The model is very relevant for mission operations and planning, especially when flare characteristics and source location are not available in real time, as at Mars distance.

<div> 关键词:  PSR B1822−09, 脉冲轮廓组件, 信号交叉相关, 子组件, 脉冲星表面

总结:<br />
研究利用500米口径球面射电望远镜观测数据成功识别了PSR B1822−09的不同脉冲轮廓组件的子组件，并通过单脉冲强度序列的相位-相位交叉相关确定子组件的数量和边缘。研究结果表明，PSR B1822−09的主脉冲（MP）、前驱（PC）和间脉冲（IP）都由三个子组件组成。强烈的子组件之间的正相关表明存在脉冲星表面不同区域的响应，并提出了不同子组件对应于脉冲星表面不同区域的假设。这些复杂的相关关系对描述不同脉冲轮廓组件之间关系的现有理论提出了挑战。 <div>
Using observational data obtained with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, we succeeded in identifying subcomponents of different pulse profile components of PSR B1822−09 by the phase-to-phase cross correlations between intensity sequences of single pulses. The determined number of the subcomponents and edges of the subcomponents are consistent with the results of Gaussian fitting on the mean pulse profiles of PSR B1822−09. According to the results, the main pulse (MP) in both the radio burst mode (B mode) and the radio-quiet mode (Q mode), the precursor (PC), and the interpulse (IP) of PSR B1822−09 are all composed of three subcomponents. The correlation coefficients between intensity sequences at different pulse phases reveal a positive correlation between the subcomponent C8 of the MP and C3 of the IP in the Q mode, and a positive correlation between C5 of the PC and C2 of the IP during the switching process from the B mode to the Q mode. These complex correlations present a challenge for the existing scenarios that describe relations between different pulse profile components. We proposed a hypothesis that different subcomponents correspond to different subpatches on the pulsar surface, and emissions from a subpatch reveal responses of the subpatch to some variations like the voltage in the magnetosphere. Therefore, correlations between different subcomponents depend on the responses of the subpatches to the variations.

We present griz photometric light curves for the full 5 yr of the Dark Energy Survey Supernova (DES-SN) program, obtained with both forced point-spread function photometry on difference images (DiffImg) performed during survey operations, and scene modelling photometry (SMP) on search images processed after the survey. This release contains 31,636 DiffImg and 19,706 high-quality SMP light curves, the latter of which contain 1635 photometrically classified SNe that pass cosmology quality cuts. This sample spans the largest redshift (z) range ever covered by a single SN survey (0.1 < z < 1.13) and is the largest single sample from a single instrument of SNe ever used for cosmological constraints. We describe in detail the improvements made to obtain the final DES-SN photometry and provide a comparison to what was used in the 3 yr DES-SN spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia SN sample. We also include a comparative analysis of the performance of the SMP photometry with respect to the real-time DiffImg forced photometry and find that SMP photometry is more precise, more accurate, and less sensitive to the host-galaxy surface brightness anomaly. The public release of the light curves and ancillary data can be found at github.com/des-science/DES-SN5YR and doi:10.5281/zenodo.12720777.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了对10个类星体（包括两个平谱射电类星体（FSRQs）和八个BL Lacertae目标（BL Lacs））进行了紫外通量变化的研究。研究发现其中九个类星体在短时间尺度上（小时级别）存在紫外通量的变化，并且发现在这些类星体中，紫外光谱的变化表现出亮时更蓝的趋势。通过观察分析得出，这些类星体的紫外辐射主要由喷流同步辐射的过程主导。整体来看，在研究对象中的FSRQs和BL Lacs在紫外光谱的变化行为上没有明显差异。 <div>
Blazars, the peculiar class of active galactic nuclei, are known to show flux variations across the accessible electromagnetic spectrum. Though they have been studied extensively for their flux variability characteristics across wavelengths, information on their ultraviolet (UV) flux variations on timescales of hours is very limited. Here, we present the first UV flux variability study on intraday timescales of a sample of ten blazars comprising two flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and eight BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs). These objects, spanning a redshift (z) range of 0.034 ≤ z ≤ 1.003, were observed in the far-UV (1300−1800 Å) and near-UV (2000−3000 Å) wavebands using the ultraviolet imaging telescope on board AstroSat. UV flux variations on timescales of hours were detected in nine sources out of the observed ten blazars. The spectral variability analysis showed a bluer-when-brighter trend with no difference in the UV spectral variability behavior between the studied sample of FSRQs and BL Lacs. The observed UV flux and spectral variability in our sample of both FSRQs and BL Lacs revealed that the observed UV emission in them is dominated by jet synchrotron process.

总结:
使用Insight-HXMT观测，研究了黑洞X射线暂现双星4U 1630–472在2022和2023年的爆发过程中的光谱特性，发现出现了不寻常的软态。通过kerrbb模型考虑硬化因子对盘温度的影响，发现盘的流量和温度分别与时间呈线性关系。通过p-free模型拟合发现，径向依赖性指数p值与盘温度呈反相关关系。结合非热分数和光度的关系图，发现盘从2022年到2023年可能向辐射效率降低的丰满盘演变，这种演变可能取决于高软态中非热辐射的分数。 <br /><br /> <div>
We study the spectral properties of the black hole X-ray transient binary 4U 1630–472 during its 2022 and 2023 outbursts with Insight-HXMT observations. We find that the outbursts are in peculiar soft states. The effect of the hardening factor on the disk temperature is taken into account by the kerrbb model, and the flux and temperature of the disk are found to follow and for the two outbursts, respectively. The flux–temperature relation is roughly consistent with a standard disk. By fitting with a p-free model, the p-value, the exponent of the radial dependence of the disk temperature, is found to have an anticorrelation with disk temperature. Combining a joint diagnostic analysis with a diagram of the relation between the nonthermal fraction and luminosity, we find a possible scenario that the disk evolves from 2022 to 2023 toward a slim one with a decreasing radiation efficiency, where such an evolution may depend on the fraction of the nonthermal emission in the high soft state.

<div> 太阳色球加热，等离子体流出，波的贡献，数值实验，离子-中性碰撞

总结:<br /><br />这篇论文提供了一个新的关于太阳色球加热和等离子体流出的视角，重点关注太阳颗粒运动产生的波的贡献。通过2.5D数值实验，研究部分电离的太阳大气中这些波的衰减以及它们通过离子-中性碰撞对等离子体流出和色球加热的影响。采用联合分析和数值方法代码，采用两流体模型方程，研究部分电离的氢等离子体动力学，包括质子+电子和中性粒子，将它们视为通过离子-中性碰撞耦合的两个独立流体。我们的研究重点放在一个安静的太阳色球区域，它具有重力层化和初始设置的单个磁弧的磁约束。这些波的主要来源是光球下方的太阳对流运动。我们的结果表明，离子-中性碰撞导致这些波的耗散，释放出加热色球等离子体的热能。值得注意的是，这伴随着向上的等离子体流动。最后，我们得出结论，离子-中性碰撞导致两流体等离子模型中的波的耗散，诱发色球加热和等离子体流出。 <div>
This paper offers a fresh perspective on solar chromosphere heating and plasma outflows, focusing on the contribution of waves generated by solar granulation. Utilizing a 2.5D numerical experiment for the partially ionized lower solar atmosphere, we investigate the dissipation of these waves and their impact on plasma outflows and chromospheric heating via ion-neutral collisions. Employing the JOint ANalytical and Numerical Approach code, we adopt two-fluid model equations, examining partially ionized hydrogen plasma dynamics, including protons+electrons and neutrals, treated as two separate fluids that are coupled through ion-neutral collisions. Our investigation focuses on a quiet solar chromosphere region characterized by gravitational stratification and magnetic confinement by an initially set single magnetic arcade. The primary source of the waves is the solar convection beneath the photosphere. Our results demonstrate that ion-neutral collisions result in the dissipation of such waves, releasing thermal energy that heats the chromosphere plasma. Notably, this is accompanied by upward-directed plasma flows. Finally, we conclude that wave dissipation due to ion-neutral collisions in the two-fluid plasma model induces chromosphere heating and plasma outflows.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用哈勃太空望远镜的钙H和K窄带成像技术，首次测量了 M31矮星系 Andromeda XVI 和 Andromeda XXVIII 中约300颗恒星的金属丰度。通过测量得知，And XVI 显现出比银河超微矮星系更富含金属的特点，而And XXVIII则位于矮星系质量-金属丰度关系上。两个矮星系的金属丰度分布函数没有明显的金属富集截断，表明恒星形成逐渐减少。此外，两个矮星系的金属丰度梯度与FIRE模拟的预测一致，这一梯度受到恒星反馈的影响，而这导致暗物质核心的形成。研究还包括了19颗金属极贫（[Fe/H] < -3.0）的恒星候选者，占据了And XVI金属丰度分布的7%和And XXVIII的6%。 <div>
We present ∼300 stellar metallicity measurements in two faint M31 dwarf galaxies, Andromeda XVI (MV = −7.5) and Andromeda XXVIII (MV = –8.8), derived using metallicity-sensitive calcium H and K narrowband Hubble Space Telescope imaging. These are the first individual stellar metallicities in And XVI (95 stars). Our And XXVIII sample (191 stars) is a factor of ∼15 increase over literature metallicities. For And XVI, we measure , , and ∇[Fe/H] = −0.23 ± 0.15 dex . We find that And XVI is more metal-rich than Milky Way ultrafaint dwarf galaxies of similar luminosity, which may be a result of its unusually extended star formation history. For And XXVIII, we measure , , and ∇[Fe/H]= −0.46 ± 0.10 dex , placing it on the dwarf galaxy mass–metallicity relation. Neither galaxy has a metallicity distribution function (MDF) with an abrupt metal-rich truncation, suggesting that star formation fell off gradually. The stellar metallicity gradient measurements are among the first for faint (L ≲ 106L⊙) galaxies outside the Milky Way halo. Both galaxies’ gradients are consistent with predictions from the FIRE simulations, where an age–gradient strength relationship is the observational consequence of stellar feedback that produces dark matter cores. We include a catalog for community spectroscopic follow-up, including 19 extremely metal-poor ([Fe/H] < –3.0) star candidates, which make up 7% of And XVI’s MDF and 6% of And XXVIII’s.

热次矮B(sdB)星是被剥离了氦燃烧层的恒星，通常出现在紧密双星系统中，受到强烈的潮汐相互作用影响。对于这类恒星，潮汐激发引起的重力波耗散将改变它们在sdB寿命期间的自转演化。本文中，我们直接计算了现实条件下sdB恒星模型中内部重力波的潮汐激发，并积分了sdB双星的自转轨道演化。我们发现，对于典型的sdB(质量为0.47太阳质量)双星系统，它们能在sdB生命周期内达到潮汐同步的过渡轨道周期约为0.2天，且对伴星质量的依赖性不强。对于由更大质量的前体恒星形成的低质量sdB(质量为0.37太阳质量)，过渡轨道周期变为约0.15天。这些数值与观测中明显的潮汐同步边界(约为0.2天)非常接近。我们讨论了潮汐力矩对恒星半径的依赖性，并对由潮汐同步sdB双星形成的快速旋转白矮星做出了预测。 <br /><br />总结: sdB星是被剥离了氦燃烧层的恒星，常出现在紧密双星系统中，受到强烈的潮汐相互作用影响。本文中，将直接计算了现实条件下sdB恒星模型中内部重力波的潮汐激发，并对sdB双星的自转轨道演化进行了分析。研究发现典型sdB双星系统能在sdB生命周期内达到潮汐同步的过渡轨道周期约为0.2天，对伴星质量的依赖性不强。同时对低质量sdB系统也进行了研究，并对快速旋转白矮星形成做出了预测。 <div>
Hot subdwarf B (sdB) stars are stripped helium-burning stars that are often found in close binaries, where they experience strong tidal interactions. The dissipation of tidally excited gravity waves alters their rotational evolution throughout the sdB lifetime. While many sdB binaries have well-measured rotational and orbital frequencies, there have been few theoretical efforts to accurately calculate the tidal torque produced by gravity waves. In this work, we directly calculate the tidal excitation of internal gravity waves in realistic sdB stellar models and integrate the coupled spin–orbit evolution of sdB binaries. We find that for canonical sdB (MsdB = 0.47 M⊙) binaries, the transitional orbital period below which they could reach tidal synchronization in the sdB lifetime is ∼0.2 day, with weak dependence on the companion masses. For low-mass sdBs (MsdB = 0.37 M⊙) formed from more massive progenitor stars, the transitional orbital period becomes ∼0.15 day. These values are very similar to the tidal synchronization boundary (∼0.2 day) evident from observations. We discuss the dependence of tidal torques on stellar radii, and we make predictions for the rapidly rotating white dwarfs formed from synchronized sdB binaries.

<title>A More Precise Measurement of the Radius of PSR J0740+6620 Using Updated NICER Data</title>

<div> PSR J0740+6620, neutron star, mass, radius, NICER<br />
<br />
PSR J0740+6620是质量精确定的中子星，辐射观测推断其质量为2.08 ± 0.07太阳质量。对其半径的测量有望限制中子星核心的性质。通过对2022年4月21日之前通过NICER积累的数据和XMM-Newton观测的数据进行分析，得出其赤道周长半径为km（68%可信度），这一结果略小于之前的报告，暗示了比之前推测的略软的状态方程。如果将半径限制在16km以下，则68%的可信区间为km，与之前的研究结果接近。 <div>
PSR J0740+6620 is the neutron star with the highest precisely determined mass, inferred from radio observations to be 2.08 ± 0.07 M⊙. Measurements of its radius therefore hold promise to constrain the properties of the cold, catalyzed, high-density matter in neutron star cores. Previously, Miller et al. and Riley et al. reported measurements of the radius of PSR J0740+6620 based on Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) observations accumulated through 2020 April 17, and an exploratory analysis utilizing NICER background estimates and a data set accumulated through 2021 December 28 was presented in Salmi et al. Here we report an updated radius measurement, derived by fitting models of X-ray emission from the neutron star surface to NICER data accumulated through 2022 April 21, totaling ∼1.1 Ms additional exposure compared to the data set analyzed in Miller et al. and Riley et al., and to data from XMM-Newton observations. We find that the equatorial circumferential radius of PSR J0740+6620 is km (68% credibility), a fractional uncertainty ∼83% the width of that reported in Miller et al., in line with statistical expectations given the additional data. If we were to require the radius to be less than 16 km, as was done in Salmi et al., then our 68% credible region would become km, which is close to the headline result of Salmi et al. Our updated measurements, along with other laboratory and astrophysical constraints, imply a slightly softer equation of state than that inferred from our previous measurements.

PSR J0740+6620是一个大质量脉冲星，研究利用2018年至2022年间的NICER数据进行了更新分析。通过将新的NICER数据与XMM-Newton数据联合建模，并利用射电定时测量得到的严格质量先验，确定了该脉冲星的赤道半径和引力质量。结果表明，PSR J0740+6620的半径在11.15至11.7 km之间，质量为1.97至2.04个太阳质量，排除了密集物质的非常软的状态方程。研究还表明，结果不会显著受到NICER和XMM-Newton之间的交叉标定不确定性的影响。此外，通过模拟数据，验证了分析流程的准确性。总结: <br /><br />该研究利用了大量NICER数据更新了PSR J0740+6620脉冲星的半径、质量和加热表面区域的分析。通过联合建模NICER和XMM-Newton数据，采用严格的质量先验，得出了该脉冲星的半径和引力质量，结果排除了非常软的状态方程，且不会受到交叉标定不确定性的影响。同时，作者还验证了分析流程的准确性。 <div>
We report an updated analysis of the radius, mass, and heated surface regions of the massive pulsar PSR J0740+6620 using Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) data from 2018 September 21 to 2022 April 21, a substantial increase in data set size compared to previous analyses. Using a tight mass prior from radio-timing measurements and jointly modeling the new NICER data with XMM-Newton data, the inferred equatorial radius and gravitational mass are km and M⊙, respectively, each reported as the posterior credible interval bounded by the 16% and 84% quantiles, with an estimated systematic error ≲ 0.1 km. This result was obtained using the best computationally feasible sampler settings providing a strong radius lower limit but a slightly more uncertain radius upper limit. The inferred radius interval is also close to the km obtained by Dittmann et al., when they require the radius to be less than 16 km as we do. The results continue to disfavor very soft equations of state for dense matter, with R < 11.15 km for this high-mass pulsar excluded at the 95% probability. The results do not depend significantly on the assumed cross-calibration uncertainty between NICER and XMM-Newton. Using simulated data that resemble the actual observations, we also show that our pipeline is capable of recovering parameters for the inferred models reported in this paper.

总结:红巨星的磁场仍然不太清楚。通过模拟发现，红巨星的表面磁场取决于对流运动的尺度，较大的尺度会产生较强的大尺度磁场。对模拟结果与观测进行比较，发现模拟值与观测值非常接近。另外，还提出了红巨星磁场可能会发生翻转的可能性。 <div>
The magnetic field of red giants is still poorly understood today. Close to the core, asteroseismology has revealed magnetic fields of several hundred thousand gauss, but close to the surface, spectropolarimetric observations of the red giant Pollux only showed an average field of the order of 1 G. Using the ASH code, we conduct a series of 3D nonlinear magnetohydrodynamical simulations aiming at modeling the dynamo process operating within the extended convective envelope of a star similar to the red giant Pollux. We find that the dynamo is efficient even for the slow rotation considered and that large-scale fields are generated and maintained. We further test the correlation between the scale of the convective motions and the surface magnetic field geometry by varying the Prandtl number in our simulations. We show in particular that the value and the geometry of the modeled surface field depend directly on the coupling scales between the magnetic and the velocity fields, with larger convective cells leading to a stronger large-scale magnetic field. We also verify that the dynamo and the geometry of the resulting field are robust against a change of the initial conditions. We then compare our simulations to the observed field and find average ∣Bℓ∣ of about 7 G for the simulation with large convective cells, and down to 2 G for the smaller-scale simulation, very close to the observed value. Finally, we suggest the possibility of the reversal of the red giant’s magnetic field.

<div> 最 massive ETGs, galaxy mergers, low-density environments, tidal features, gas-abundant mergers
<br /><br />
在这篇文章中，研究了436个质量最大的早期星系（ETGs），发现它们在低密度环境下更频繁地展现潮汐特征。研究表明，质量最大的ETGs在低密度环境中更可能经历了近期的星系合并，这暗示它们具有持续到现在的延续形成历史。另外发现，具有较蓝色光谱的质量最大ETGs更加驱动了这一发现，而低密度环境中更常观察到尘埃带，这意味着富含气体的星系合并在增加低密度环境中最近星系合并的速率方面起到了主要作用。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
The most massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) are known to form through numerous galaxy mergers. Thus, it is intriguing to study whether their formation in low-density environments, where nearby companions are almost absent, is associated with mergers, which are directly traced by tidal features. Using the 436 most massive ETGs with Mstar > 1011.2M⊙ at z < 0.04, we determine the variation in the fraction of massive ETGs with tidal features (fT) across different environments and verify whether the most massive ETGs commonly have tidal features in very low density environments. Our main discovery is that the most massive ETGs exhibit tidal features more frequently in lower-density environments. In the highest-density environments, like galaxy clusters, fT is 0.21 ± 0.06, while in the lowest-density environments it triples to 0.62 ± 0.06. This trend is stronger for more extremely massive ETGs, with fT reaching 0.92 ± 0.08 in the lowest-density environments. One explanation for our finding is that the most massive ETGs in lower-density environments have genuinely experienced recent mergers more frequently than their counterparts in higher-density environments, suggesting that they possess extended formation histories that continue into the present. Another possibility is that tidal features last shorter in denser environments owing to external factors inherent in these environments. Our additional findings that massive ETGs with bluer u − r colors are a more dominant driver of our main discovery and that dust lanes are more commonly observed in massive ETGs in low-density environments imply that gas-abundant mergers primarily contribute to the increased rate of recent mergers in low-density environments.

<div> 关键词: PSR J2215+5135, redback spider pulsar, X-ray observations, neutron star mass, intrabinary shock

总结:<br /><br />本研究报告了对PSR J2215+5135进行的新的X射线和U波段观测。通过产生轨道光变曲线并利用其来模拟系统特性，我们得到了最佳拟合的光学模型，给出了中子星质量MNS = 1.98 ± 0.08 M⊙的估计值，比之前报道的要低。然而，由于恒星大气金属丰度的不确定性，导致J2215对此参数特别敏感，我们需要考虑MNS∼1.85–2.3 M⊙的统计范围。从X射线分析中，我们发现IBS环绕着脉冲星，但脉冲星风与伴星风的动量比异常接近于1，意味着IBS几何形态较其他蜘蛛脉冲星更为扁平。通过估算伴星风动量和速度，我们得到伴星的质量损失率约为每年10^(-10)个太阳质量，这意味着J2215可能在大约10亿年内变为孤立的毫秒脉冲星。我们的X射线分析对脉冲星风的磁化和粒子密度施加了限制，并支持高度磁化的相对论IBS中的磁重连接和粒子加速模型。 <div>
PSR J2215+5135 (J2215) is a “redback” spider pulsar, where the intrabinary shock (IBS) wraps around the pulsar rather than the stellar-mass companion. Spider orbital light curves are modulated, dominated by their binary companion thermal emission in the optical bands and by IBS synchrotron emission in the X-rays. We report on new XMM-Newton X-ray and U-band observations of J2215. We produce orbital light curves and use them to model the system properties. Our best-fit optical light model gives a neutron star mass MNS = 1.98 ± 0.08 M⊙, lower than previously reported. However, uncertainty in the stellar atmosphere metallicity, a parameter to which J2215 is unusually sensitive, requires us to consider an acceptable systematic plus statistical range of MNS ∼ 1.85–2.3 M⊙. From the X-ray analysis, we find that the IBS wraps around the pulsar but with a pulsar-wind-to-companion-wind-momentum ratio unusually close to unity, implying a flatter IBS geometry than seen in other spiders. Estimating the companion wind momentum and speed from the X-ray light curve, we find a companion mass-loss rate of yr−1 so that J2215 may become an isolated millisecond pulsar in ∼1 Gyr. Our X-ray analyses place constraints on the magnetization and particle density of the pulsar wind and support models of magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the highly magnetized relativistic IBS.

We present a census of photometrically detected rotation periods for white dwarf (WD) stars. We analyzed the light curves of 9285 WD stars observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite up to Sector 69. Using Fourier transform analyses and the TESS_localize software, we detected variability periods for 318 WD stars. The 115 high-probability likely single WDs in our sample have a median rotational period of 3.9 hr and a median absolute deviation of 3.5 hr. Our distribution is significantly different from the distribution of the rotational period from asteroseismology, which exhibits a longer median period of 24.2 hr and a median absolute deviation of 12.1 hr. In addition, we reported nonpulsating periods for three known pulsating WDs with rotational periods previously determined by asteroseismology: NGC 1501, TIC 7675859, and G226-29. We also calculated evolutionary models including six angular momentum transfer mechanisms from the literature throughout evolution in an attempt to reproduce our findings. Our models indicate that the temperature–period relation of most observational data is best fitted by models with low metallicity, probably indicating problems with the computations of angular momentum loss during the high-mass-loss phase. Our models also generate internal magnetic fields through the Tayler–Spruit dynamo.

Aromatic structures are fundamental for key biological molecules such as RNA and metabolites and the abundances of aromatic molecules on young planets are therefore of high interest. Recent detections of benzonitrile and other aromatic compounds in interstellar clouds and comets have revealed a rich aromatic astrochemistry. In the cold phases of star and planet formation, most of these aromatic molecules are likely to reside in icy grain mantles, where they could be observed through IR spectroscopy. We present laboratory IR spectra of benzene and four monosubstituted benzene molecules—toluene, phenol, benzonitrile, and benzaldehyde—to determine their IR ice absorbances in undiluted aromatic ices, and in mixtures with water and CO. We also characterize the aromatic ice desorption rates, and extract binding energies and respective pre-exponential factors using temperature-programmed desorption experiments. We use these to predict at which protostellar and protoplanetary disk temperatures these molecules sublimate into the gas phase. We find that benzene and monosubstituted benzene derivatives are low-volatility with binding energies in the 5220–8390 K (43–70 kJ mol−1) range, which suggests that most of the chemistry of benzene and of functionalized aromatic molecules is to be expected to occur in the ice phase during star and planet formation.

<div> 关键词: He/H ratio, cool stars, spectroscopic analysis, solar model atmospheres, helium abundance<br />
总结: 本研究通过对观测到的太阳光球谱线的分析，利用MgH分子线和中性Mg原子线的组合，以及CH和C2分子线与中性C原子线的组合，来确定太阳光球的氦丰度。通过采用不同He/H比例的太阳模型大气来进行光谱分析，最终确定了太阳的He/H比例。这一结果对于表征不同有效温度下的冷星的He/H比例提供了重要的参考点。该研究填补了冷星He/H比例的知识空白，是天体物理学中的一个基本挑战。<br /><br /> <div>
Determining the He/H ratio in cool stars presents a fundamental astrophysical challenge. While this ratio is established for hot O and B stars, its extrapolation to cool stars remains uncertain due to the absence of helium lines in their observed spectra. We address this knowledge gap by focusing on the Sun as a representative cool star. We conduct spectroscopic analyses of the observed solar photospheric lines by utilizing a combination of MgH molecular lines and neutral Mg atomic lines including yet another combination of CH and C2 molecular lines with neutral C atomic lines. Our spectroscopic analyses were further exploited by adopting solar model atmospheres constructed for distinct He/H ratios to determine the solar photospheric helium abundance. The helium abundance is determined by enforcing the fact that for an adopted model atmosphere with an appropriate He/H ratio, the derived Mg abundance from the neutral Mg atomic lines and that from the MgH molecular lines must be the same. The same holds for the C abundance derived from neutral C atomic lines and that from CH lines of the CH molecular band and C2 lines from the C2 Swan band. The estimated He/H ratio for the Sun is discussed based on the one-dimensional local thermodynamic equilibrium model atmosphere. The helium abundance (He/H = ) obtained for the Sun serves as a critical reference point to characterize the He/H ratio of cool stars across the range in their effective temperature.

The spectra of several galaxies, including extremely metal-poor galaxies from EMPRESS, have shown that the abundances of some Si-group elements differ from “spherical” explosion models of massive stars. This leads to the speculation that these galaxies have experienced supernova explosions with high asphericity, where mixing and fallback of the inner ejecta with the outer material lead to the distinctive chemical compositions. In this paper, we consider the jet-driven supernova models by direct 2D hydrodynamics simulations using progenitors of about 20–25 M⊙ at zero metallicity. We investigate how the abundance patterns depend on the progenitor mass, mass cut, and asphericity of the explosion. We compare the observable with available supernova and galaxy catalogs based on 56Ni, ejecta mass, and individual element ratios. The proximity of our results with the observational data signifies the importance of aspherical supernova explosions in chemical evolution of these galaxies. Our models will provide the theoretical counterpart for understanding the chemical abundances of high-z galaxies measured by the James Webb Space Telescope.

We present the most detailed spectrum of intracluster light (ICL) in an individual cluster to date, the relaxed system RX J2129.7+0005, at z ∼ 0.234. Using 15 broadband, deep images observed with the Hubble Space Telescope and JWST in the optical and the infrared, plus deep integral field spectroscopy from MUSE, we computed a total of 3696 ICL maps spanning the spectral range ∼0.4−5 μm with our algorithm CICLE, a method that is extremely well suited to analyzing large samples of data in a fully automated way. We used both parametric and nonparametric approaches to fit the spectral energy distribution of the ICL and infer its physical properties, yielding a stellar mass between 11.5 and 12.7 and an average age between 9.7 and 10.5 Gyr, from CIGALE and Prospector results. This implies that the ICL in RX J2129.7+0005 is, on average, older than that of disturbed clusters, suggesting that the contribution from different stellar populations to the ICL is at play depending on the cluster’s dynamical state. Coupled with X-ray observations of the hot gas distribution, we confirm the relaxed state of RX J2129.7+0005, showing clear signs of sloshing after a last major merger with a high-mass-ratio satellite that could have happened ∼6.6 Gyr ago in a relatively radial orbit. The presence of substructure in the ICL, such as shells, clouds with different densities and a certain degree of boxyness, and a clump, supports this scenario.

<title>Characterizing the Rapid Hydrogen Disappearance in SN 2022crv: Evidence of a Continuum between Type Ib and IIb Supernova Properties</title>

总结:
SN 2022crv是一个被发现在NGC 3054中的剥离型超新星，具有Ib/IIb型的特征。早期观测显示出高速氢特征，随后迅速消失。超新星的光谱分析表明其起源于一个质量为4.5-5.6太阳质量的He恒星，可能是从一颗质量为16-22太阳质量的主序星演化而来。此外，NIR光谱显示出一个在He i线的蓝侧的独特吸收特征，可能是由于Sr II。进一步的建模可以揭示超新星的起源以及NIR中神秘吸收特征的本质。<br /><br /> <div>
We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) observations of SN 2022crv, a stripped-envelope supernova in NGC 3054, discovered within 12 hr of explosion by the Distance Less Than 40 Mpc Survey. We suggest that SN 2022crv is a transitional object on the continuum between Type Ib supernovae (SNe Ib) and Type IIb supernovae (SNe IIb). A high-velocity hydrogen feature (∼ −20,000 to −16,000 km s−1) was conspicuous in SN 2022crv at early phases, and then quickly disappeared. We find that a hydrogen envelope of ∼10−3M⊙ can reproduce the observed behavior of the hydrogen feature. The lack of early envelope cooling emission implies that SN 2022crv had a compact progenitor with an extremely low amount of hydrogen. A nebular spectral analysis shows that SN 2022crv is consistent with the explosion of a He star with a final mass of ∼4.5–5.6 M⊙ that evolved from a ∼16 to 22 M⊙ zero-age main-sequence star in a binary system with ∼1.0–1.7 M⊙ of oxygen finally synthesized in the core. In order to retain such a small amount of hydrogen, the initial orbital separation of the binary system is likely larger than ∼1000 R⊙. The NIR spectra of SN 2022crv show a unique absorption feature on the blue side of the He i line at ∼1.005 μm. This is the first time such a feature has been observed in SNe Ib/IIb, and it could be due to Sr II. Further detailed modeling of SN 2022crv can shed light on the progenitor and the origin of the mysterious absorption feature in the NIR.

这篇文章研究了伽玛射线暴（GRBs）的后余辉光曲线和偏振特征，着重分析了能量下降缓慢的浅喷流特征。研究发现，与传统的顶帽喷流模型相比，整体偏振度较低。提供了偏振度峰值的解析表达式，该峰值与能量剖面幂律指数、磁场配置和观测角度有关，并表明对于所有观测者，峰值偏振度发生在光曲线拐点附近。针对GRB 221009A事件，发现在光学和X射线波段，后余辉偏振度的上限与该事件的浅喷流结构猜测相符。同时发现，在早期时刻，偏振水平可能会显著提高，有潜力区分不同的喷流结构模型，并可能约束那个阶段前后冲击波的磁化程度。 
<br /><br />总结: <div>
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are powered by ultrarelativistic jets. The launching sites of these jets are surrounded by dense media, which the jets must cross before they can accelerate and release high-energy emission. Interaction with the medium leads to the formation of a mildly relativistic sheath around the jet, resulting in an angular structure to the jet’s asymptotic Lorentz factor and energy per solid angle, which modifies the afterglow emission. We build a semi-analytical tool to analyze the afterglow light curve and polarization signatures of jets observed from a wide range of viewing angles, and focus on ones with slowly declining energy profiles known as shallow jets. We find overall lower polarization compared to the classical top hat jet model. We provide an analytical expression for the peak polarization degree as a function of the energy profile power-law index, magnetic field configuration, and viewing angle, and show that it occurs near the light-curve break time for all viewers. When applying our tool to GRB 221009A, suspected to originate from a shallow jet, we find that the suggested jet structures for this event agree with the upper limits placed on the afterglow polarization in the optical and X-ray bands. We also find that at early times the polarization levels may be significantly higher, allowing for a potential distinction between different jet structure models and possibly constraining the magnetization in both forward and reverse shocks at that stage.

总结:
本文分析了2000年至2022年间针对Cen A的Chandra先进CCD成像光谱仪观测数据，并开发了一种算法，系统地拟合了其X射线喷流结的固有运动。大多数结的表观固有运动都低于检测限。然而，一个距离核心520光年的结的表观超光速固有运动为2.7 ± 0.4倍光速。这限制了喷流的倾斜角为i < 41° ± 6°，该结的速度为β > 0.94 ± 0.02，这与事件视界望远镜内部喷流测得的倾斜角很一致，但与基于喷流和反喷流亮度的先前估计相矛盾。它还与相应的射电结的固有运动（为0.8 ± 0.1倍光速）相矛盾，这进一步表明X射线和射电波段追踪喷流中不同的结构。喷流核心附近有四个突出的X射线结，但只有一个与固定状态矛盾。一些喷流结在非径向方向上也有显著的固有运动分量，这一分量在喷流中心附近通常更大。我们还在距核心100光年处检测到亮度和形态变化。 <div>
The structure of the jet in Cen A is likely better revealed in X-rays than in the radio band, which is usually used to investigate jet proper motions. In this paper, we analyze Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer observations of Cen A from 2000 to 2022 and develop an algorithm for systematically fitting the proper motions of its X-ray jet knots. Most of the knots had an apparent proper motion below the detection limit. However, one knot at a transverse distance of 520 pc had an apparent superluminal proper motion of 2.7 ± 0.4c. This constrains the inclination of the jet to be i < 41° ± 6° and the velocity of this knot to be β > 0.94 ± 0.02. This agrees well with the inclination measured in the inner jet by the Event Horizon Telescope but contradicts previous estimates based on jet and counterjet brightness. It also disagrees with the proper motion of the corresponding radio knot, of 0.8 ± 0.1c, which further indicates that the X-ray and radio bands trace distinct structures in the jet. There are four prominent X-ray jet knots closer to the nucleus, but only one of these is inconsistent with being stationary. A few jet knots also have a significant proper-motion component in the nonradial direction. This component is typically larger closer to the center of the jet. We also detect brightness and morphology variations at a transverse distance of 100 pc from the nucleus.

The physical origin of the large cavities observed in transition disks is to date still unclear. Different physical mechanisms (e.g., a companion, dead zones, enhanced grain growth) produce disk cavities of different depth, and the expected spatial distribution of gas and solids in each mechanism is not the same. In this work, we analyze the multiwavelength interferometric visibilities of dust continuum observations obtained with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and Very Large Array for six transition disks: CQTau, UXTau A, LkCa15, RXJ1615, SR24S, and DMTau, and calculate brightness radial profiles, where diverse emission morphology is revealed at different wavelengths. The multiwavelength data are used to model the spectral energy distribution and compute constraints on the radial profile of the dust surface density, maximum grain size, and dust temperature in each disk. They are compared with the observational signatures expected from various physical mechanisms responsible for disk cavities. The observational signatures suggest that the cavities observed in the disks around UXTau A, LkCa15, and RXJ1615 could potentially originate from a dust trap created by a companion. Conversely, in the disks around CQTau, SR24S, DMTau, the origin of the cavity remains unclear, although it is compatible with a pressure bump and grain growth within the cavity.

We present near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy using the MMT and Magellan infrared spectrograph for a sample of 29 massive galaxies ( ) at z ∼ 0.7 with optical spectroscopy from the Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census (LEGA-C) survey. Having both optical and NIR spectroscopy at this redshift allows us to measure the full suite of rest-optical strong emission lines, enabling the study of ionization sources and the rest-optical selection of active galactic nuclei (AGN), as well as the measurement of dust-corrected Hα-based star formation rates (SFRs). We find that 11 out of 29 galaxies host AGN. We infer the nonparametric star formation histories with the spectral energy distribution fitting code Prospector and classify galaxies as star-forming, green valley, or quiescent based on their most recent specific SFRs. We explore the connection between AGN activity and suppressed star formation, and find that 89% ± 15% of galaxies in the green valley or below host AGN, while only 15% ± 8% of galaxies above the green valley host AGN. We construct the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) and find that the AGN host galaxies are 0.37 dex below the SFMS, while galaxies without detectable AGN are consistent with being on the SFMS. However, when compared to a bootstrapped mass-matched sample, the SFRs of our sample of AGN host galaxies are consistent with the full LEGA-C sample. Based on this mass-matched analysis, we cannot rule out that this suppression of star formation is driven by other processes associated with the higher mass of the AGN sample. We therefore cannot link the presence of AGN activity to the quenching of star formation.

There is an intriguing and growing population of Neptune-sized planets with stellar obliquities near ∼90°. One previously proposed formation pathway is a disk-driven resonance, which can take place at the end stages of planet formation in a system containing an inner Neptune, outer cold Jupiter, and protoplanetary disk. This mechanism occurs within the first ∼10 Myr, but most of the polar Neptunes we see today are ∼Gyr old. Up until now, there has not been an extensive analysis of whether the polar orbits are stable over ∼Gyr timescales. Tidal realignment mechanisms are known to operate in other systems, and if they are active here, this would cause theoretical tension with a primordial misalignment story. In this paper, we explore the effects of tidal evolution on the disk-driven resonance theory. We use both N-body and secular simulations to study tidal effects on both the initial resonant encounter and long-term evolution. We find that the polar orbits are remarkably stable on ∼Gyr timescales. Inclination damping does not occur for the polar cases, although we do identify subpolar cases where it is important. We consider two case study polar Neptunes, WASP-107 b and HAT-P-11 b, and study them in the context of this theory, finding consistency with present-day properties if their tidal quality factors are Q ≳ 104 and Q ≳ 105, respectively.

<title>The Bicoherence Analysis of Type-C Quasiperiodic Oscillations in Swift J1727.8−1613</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the results of bicoherence analysis for Swift J1727.8−1613 during its 2023 outburst, using data from Insight-HXMT. Our analysis focused on observations with quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) of frequencies greater than 1 Hz, revealing that all of them belong to type-C QPOs. We found a strong correlation between the QPO frequency and the hardness ratio, as well as a linear relationship between the QPO rms and the hardness ratio. The bicoherence analysis revealed a transition from a “web” pattern to a “hypotenuse” pattern in the low-energy (LE) and high-energy (HE) bands. In the bicoherence patterns, there are correlations between horizontal and vertical bicoherence at f1 = f2 = fQPO with count rates. The diagonal structure at f1 + f2 = fQPO becomes more prominent with increasing energy. Additionally, we discovered a new bicoherence pattern in the medium energy band from 10 to 20 keV; the diagonal structure at f1 + f2 = fhar is prominent only in this energy band, which we refer to as the “parallel” pattern. The bicoherence analysis indicates that the source is likely a low-inclination source.

<title>Analytical Models for Secular Descents in Hierarchical Triple Systems</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Three-body systems are prevalent in nature, from planetary to stellar to supermassive black hole scales. In a hierarchical triple system, oscillations of the inner orbit’s eccentricity and inclination can be induced on secular timescales. Over many cycles, the octupole-level terms in the secular equations of motion can drive the system to extremely high eccentricities via the eccentric Kozai–Lidov (EKL) mechanism. The overall decrease in the inner orbit’s pericenter distance has potentially dramatic effects for realistic systems, such as tidal disruption events. We present an analytical approximation in the test-particle limit to describe individual stepwise increases in eccentricity of the inner orbit. A second approximation, also in the test-particle limit, is obtained by integrating the equations of motion and calibrating to numerical simulations to estimate the overall octupole-level time evolution of the eccentricity. The latter approach is then extended beyond the test particle to the general case. The three novel analytical approximations are compared to numerical solutions to show that the models accurately describe the form and timescale of the secular descent from large distances to a close-encounter distance (e.g., the Roche limit). By circumventing the need for numerical simulations to obtain the long-term behavior, these approximations can be used to readily estimate properties of close encounters and descent timescales for populations of systems. We demonstrate this by calculating rates of EKL-driven migration for Hot Jupiters in stellar binaries.

<title>Recurrent Coronal Mass Ejections and Their Geomagnetic Storms Association on 2012 January 19: Solar Surface to Upper Earth’s Atmosphere Analyses</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this study, we have conducted an analysis of space weather disruptions that occurred on 19 January 2012. Our analysis identified three coronal mass ejections (CMEs), CME1, CME2, and CME3—which were ejected at 09:48:05 universal time (UT), 14:36:05 UT, and 16:12:06 UT, respectively. Nonrecurrent disturbances in space weather, such as geomagnetic storms, result from CMEs originating from the Sun and traveling toward Earth. We assess the contribution of CME–CME interactions on 2012 January 19 and the volume emission rate of nitric oxide (NO) near the Earth's upper atmosphere in prolonging the geomagnetic disturbances observed on 2012 January 23. The findings suggest an increase in intensity at the interacting boundaries of CME1 and CME2, indicating an increase in pressure and density, leading to the compression of the magnetosphere. The 3D reconstructions of the CMEs provide evidence of unequal expansion and rotations within coronagraphic frames attributed to structural variability in the background solar wind during the eruptions. Furthermore, highlights from the in situ observations suggest that the impact of the recurrent CMEs on the geomagnetic disturbance was more pronounced within the auroral region synchronizing with a significant increase in NO volume emission rate on 2012 January 23, near the upper Earth's atmosphere. Our focus is on exploring the interactions between these CMEs to understand their potential contribution to the extended duration of the observed geomagnetic disturbance.

<title>Superfluid Spin-up: Three-dimensional Simulations of Post-glitch Dynamics in Neutron Star Cores</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Neutron stars show a steady decrease in their rotational frequency, occasionally interrupted by sudden spin-up events called glitches. The dynamics of a neutron star after a glitch involve the transfer of angular momentum from the crust (where the glitch is presumed to originate) to the liquid core, causing the core to spin up. The crust–core coupling, which determines how quickly this spin-up proceeds, can be achieved through various physical processes, including Ekman pumping, superfluid vortex-mediated mutual friction, and magnetic fields. Although the complex nature of these mechanisms has made it difficult to study their combined effects, analytical estimations for individual processes reveal that spin-up timescales vary according to the relative strength of Coriolis, viscous, and mutual friction forces, as well as the magnetic field. However, experimental and numerical validations of those analytical predictions are limited. In this paper, we focus on viscous effects and mutual friction. We conduct nonlinear hydrodynamical simulations of the spin-up problem in a two-component fluid by solving the incompressible Hall–Vinen–Bekarevich–Khalatnikov equations in the full sphere (i.e., including r = 0) for the first time. We find that the viscous (normal) component accelerates due to Ekman pumping, although the mutual friction coupling to the superfluid component alters the spin-up dynamics compared to the single-fluid scenario. Close to the sphere’s surface, the response of the superfluid is accurately described by the mutual friction timescale irrespective of its coupling strength with the normal component. However, as we move deeper into the sphere, the superfluid accelerates on different timescales due to the slow viscous spin-up of the internal normal fluid layers. We discuss potential implications for neutron stars, and requirements for future work to build more realistic models.

<title>The Influence of the Magnetic Braking Laws on the Evolution of Persistent and Transient Low-mass X-Ray Binaries</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Swift J1858.6−0814 (hereafter J1858) is a transient neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB). There is controversy regarding its donor mass derived from observations and theoretical calculations. In this paper, we adopt seven magnetic braking (MB) prescriptions suggested in the literature and different metallicity Z to simulate the evolution of the LMXB. Our results show that, employing the MB model proposed by A. Reiners & S. Mohanty (“rm12”), the convection- and rotation-boosted (“carb”) model, and the intermediate (“inter”) and convection-boosted (“cboost”) models in K. X. Van et al. can match (part of) the observational parameters of J1858 well. We then apply our method to other observed LMXBs and find that the “rm12” and “inter” MB laws are most promising in explaining transient LMXBs. In comparison, the simulations with the “cboost” and “carb” MB laws are more inclined to reproduce persistent LMXBs and ultracompact X-ray binaries, respectively. Our results, though subject to computational and/or observational bias, show that it is challenging to find a unified MB law that applies to the NS LMXB subpopulations simultaneously, indicating our lack of understanding of the true MB law. In addition, we explore the influence of various MB laws on the magnitude of the bifurcation periods in LMXBs.

<title>Evidence of a Forming Nucleus in the Fourcade–Figueroa Galaxy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We analyze data from the IRAS, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, and Planck satellites, revealing an unresolved dust condensation at the center of the Fourcade–Figueroa galaxy (ESO270-G017), which may correspond to a forming nucleus. We model the condensation’s continuum spectrum in the spectral range from 3 to 1300 μm using the DUSTY code. The best-fit model, based on the chi-square test, indicates that the condensation is a shell with an outer temperature of Tout ≈ 12 K and an inner boundary temperature of Ti ≈ 500 K. The shell’s outer radius is ro = 86.2 pc, and the inner cavity radius is ri = 0.082 pc. The condensation produces an extinction AV = 50 mag, and its luminosity is Lc = 1.08 × 1034 W, which would correspond to a burst of massive star formation approximately similar to the central 5 pc of R 136 in the LMC and NGC 3603, the ionizing cluster of a giant Carina arm H ii region. The comparison with normal, luminous, and ultraluminous IR galaxies leads us to consider this obscured nucleus as the nearest and weakest object of this category.

<title>An Extremely Active Repeating Fast Radio Burst Source in a Likely Nonmagneto-ionic Environment</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright radio bursts originating at cosmological distances. Only three repeating FRBs FRB 20121102A, FRB 20190520B, and FRB 20201124A among ∼60 known repeating FRBs have circular polarization. We observed the FRB 20220912A with the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) at L-band on 2022 October 24 and detected 128 bursts in 1.4 hr, corresponding to a burst rate of about 90 hr−1, which is the highest yet for FRBs observed by the GBT. The average rotation measure (RM) was −0.4 ± 0.3 rad m−2 with negligible intraday RM change, indicating a likely nonmagneto-ionic environment. A total of 61% of bursts have a linear polarization fraction greater than 90%. Approximately 56% of the bright bursts have circular polarization. A downward drift in frequency and polarization angle swings were found in our sample. The characterization of FRB 20220912A indicates that the circular polarization is unlikely to be caused by the magneto-ionic environment for at least some of the repeating FRB population.

Variable stars in stellar clusters can offer key constraints on stellar evolution and pulsation models, utilizing estimates of host cluster properties to constrain stellar physical parameters. We present a catalog of 86 luminous (F814W < 19) variable stars in M31 clusters identified by mining the archival Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey using a combination of statistical analysis of sparse PHAT light curves and difference imaging. We determine the evolutionary phases and initial masses of these variable stars by matching them with theoretical isochrones generated using host cluster properties from the literature. We calculate the probability of PHAT photometry being blended due to the highly crowded nature of cluster environments for each cluster-variable star, using these probabilities to inform our level of confidence in the derived properties of each star. Our 86 cluster-variable stars have initial masses between 0.8 and 67 M⊙. Their evolutionary phases span the main sequence, more evolved hydrogen- and helium-burning phases, and the post–asymptotic giant branch. We identify numerous candidate variable star types: RV Tauri variables, red supergiants, and slowly pulsating B-type supergiants, along with Wolf–Rayet stars, α Cygni and Mira variables, a classical Cepheid, and a possible superasymptotic giant. We characterize 12 cluster-variable stars at higher confidence based on their difference image quality and lower blending probability. Ours is the first systematic study of variable stars in extragalactic stellar clusters leveraging the superior resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope and demonstrating the unique power of stellar clusters in constraining the fundamental properties of variable stars.

Extraterrestrial material collected during space missions is highly exposed to contamination issues during on-Earth analysis. Although high-protection-level protocols were developed, to minimize the contamination due to sample manipulation and the substrate contribution an optimal strategy is to perform in situ analysis with contactless techniques. Optical and acoustic trapping represent ideal candidates for contactless manipulation and analysis of nanometer-to-millimeter-sized particles. Here, we show results of the manipulation of cometary analogs and micrometeorite samples using a single-axis acoustic levitator. The investigation of the particle dynamics in the trap allows the calculation of the trap spring constants that are found in the mN/m range. In addition, we collect the Raman spectra of two levitated fragments of Saratov meteorite, demonstrating that acoustic levitation can be effectively used for the contactless and low-contamination characterization of samples of interest in astrophysics.

We present X-ray to radio frequency observations of the bright long gamma-ray burst GRB 210702A. Our Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array 97.5 GHz observations show a significant rebrightening by a factor of ≈2 beginning at 8.2 days post-burst and rising to peak brightness at 18.1 days before declining again. This is the first such rebrightening seen in a millimeter afterglow light curve. A standard forward shock model in a stellar wind circumburst medium can explain most of our X-ray, optical, and millimeter observations prior to the rebrightening, but significantly overpredicts the self-absorbed radio emission, and cannot explain the millimeter rebrightening. We investigate possible explanations for the millimeter rebrightening, and find that energy injection or a reverse shock from a late-time shell collision are plausible causes. Similar to other bursts, our radio data may require alternative scenarios such as a thermal electron population or a structured jet to explain the data. Our observations demonstrate that millimeter light curves can exhibit some of the rich features more commonly seen in optical and X-ray afterglow light curves, motivating further millimeter wavelength studies of GRB afterglows.

To investigate the short-term variability and determine the size of the optical continuum emitting region of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), we carried out high-cadence, multiband photometric monitoring of a Seyfert 1 galaxy J0249−0815 across two nights, together with a one-night single-band preliminary test. The presence of the broad Hα component in our target was confirmed by recent Palomar/P200 spectroscopic observations, 23 yr after the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, ruling out the supernovae origin of the broad Hα line. The photometric experiment was primarily conducted utilizing four-channel imagers MuSCAT 3 and 4 mounted on 2 m telescopes within the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network. Despite the expectation of variability, we observed no significant variation (<1.4%) on timescales of 6–10 hr. This nondetection is likely due to substantial host galaxy light diluting the subtle active galactic nucleus (AGN) variability. Additionally, we cannot rule out that the target was in a relatively quiescent state without intranight variability during our monitoring, owing to the stochastic nature of AGN variations. To enhance the possibility of detecting subtle variability signals and lag in future IMBH reverberation campaigns, it may be beneficial to select targets with a higher AGN-to-host flux ratio, and conduct dual-band preliminary tests and tailored simulations.

总结：<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了氢电离极紫外辐射引起的光蒸发对天体物体的重要影响。作者构建了一个解析模型，考虑了光加热和光电离的有限时间尺度，并将其应用于原行星盘的散射过程。与经典的完全电离和等温风模型相比，该模型提供了更准确的电离、温度和离心距离的速度估计。文章指出，光蒸发风在中心恒星的EUV辐射率和光谱硬度下呈现出几种不同的流体动力学和热化学状态。研究还展示了光蒸发效率如何随着EUV照射强度和光谱硬度的变化而变化，以及解决了关于X射线光蒸发效果的文献差异。该模型强调了光加热和光电离时间尺度对于建模和理解风观测行为的重要性。 <div>
Photoevaporation driven by hydrogen-ionizing extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) radiation profoundly shapes the lives of diverse astrophysical objects. We construct an analytical model accounting for the finite timescales of photoheating and photoionization and apply it to the dispersal of protoplanetary disks. The model yields improved estimates for the ionization, temperature, and velocity versus distance from the central source when compared to the classical picture of fully ionized and isothermal winds with temperatures ≈104 K and speeds ≈10 km s−1. In contrast to the classical picture, the photoevaporative winds take on several distinct hydrodynamical and thermochemical states depending on the central star’s EUV emission rate and spectral hardness: T Tauri stars with EUV luminosities around 1030 erg s−1 drive nonisothermal ionized disk winds at lower temperatures than the classical value if the spectrum is soft, with an average deposited energy per photoionization less than about 3.7 eV. If, however, the spectrum is hard, the winds tend to be atomic and isothermal at most disk radii. For lower EUV intensities, even with soft spectra, atomic winds can emerge beyond ∼10 au through advection. We show that these predictions are in general agreement with detailed radiation hydrodynamics calculations. The model furthermore illustrates how the energy efficiency of photoevaporation varies with the intensity and spectral hardness of the EUV illumination, as well as addressing discrepancies in the literature around the effectiveness of X-ray photoevaporation. The findings highlight the importance of the photoheating and photoionization timescales both for modeling and for understanding winds’ observed behavior.

热Sunyaev-Zeldovich效应是在L*星系的环星系介质中产生的，使用了CGM模型、新的幂律模型和TNG100模拟。研究发现，对于给定的Mvir，PLM有四个参数：halo baryon质量在热CGM气体中的分数fhCGM，virial半径处实际气体温度与virial温度的比例ϕT，热电子压力和氢核密度的幂律指数aP,th和an。B+22 Compton-y剖面暗示了陡峭的电子压力斜率(aP,th≈2)。对于等熵状态，可能存在静压平衡。B+22和D+23的结果与最近的CGM X射线观测结果一致。至于TNG100模拟，对于L*星系，它低估了tSZ参数约0.5 dex，这表明模拟中在这些质量尺度上高估了反馈强度和CGM气体损失。
<br /><br />总结: 热SZ效应的测量显示了L*星系的CGM特征，并表明使用PLM和TNG100模拟可以得出一致的结论。研究发现CGM中的气体可能存在等熵状态，并且结果与实际观测相一致。然而，模拟结果低估了tSZ参数，这可能是由于在模拟中过高估计了反馈效应和CGM气体损失。 <div>
We analyze measurements of the thermal Sunyaev–Zeldovich (tSZ) effect arising in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of L* galaxies, reported by J. N. Bregman et al. (B+22) and S. Das et al. (D+23). In our analysis, we use the Y. Faerman et al. CGM models, a new power-law model (PLM), and the TNG100 simulation. For a given Mvir, our PLM has four parameters: the fraction, fhCGM, of the halo baryon mass in hot CGM gas, the ratio, ϕT, of the actual gas temperature at the virial radius to the virial temperature, and the power-law indices, aP,th and an for the thermal electron pressure and the hydrogen nucleon density. The B+22 Compton-y profile implies steep electron pressure slopes (aP,th ≃ 2). For isothermal conditions, the temperature is at least 1.1 × 106 K, with a hot CGM gas mass of up to 3.5 × 1011M⊙ for a virial mass of 2.75 × 1012M⊙. However, if isothermal, the gas must be expanding out of the halos. An isentropic equation of state is favored for which hydrostatic equilibrium is possible. The B+22 and D+23 results are consistent with each other and with recent (0.5–2 keV) CGM X-ray observations of Milky Way mass systems. For Mvir ≃ 3 × 1012M⊙, the scaled Compton pressure integrals, , lie in the narrow range, 2.5 × 10−4–5.0 × 10−4 kpc2, for all three sets of observations. TNG100 underpredicts the tSZ parameters by factors ∼0.5 dex for the L* galaxies, suggesting that the feedback strengths and CGM gas losses are overestimated in the simulated halos at these mass scales.

<div> 高红移夸asar, 星系密度, 相关长度, 暗物质, 辐射效率
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章报告了对四个z≳6夸asar领域的观测结果，使用JWST/NIRCam进行成像和宽场无筒光谱模式。研究发现在夸asar周围的氧三发射星系数量存在广泛的差异，密度增强范围在2cMpc半径内为δ≈65，而另一些区域的密度对比接近零。通过测量夸asar及其周围星系的两点交叉相关函数，以及星系自相关函数，推断出〈z〉=6.25时夸asar的相关长度为，而氧三发射星系的相关长度为。通过与暗物质模拟比较，估计夸asar宿主暗物质暗物质最小质量为，而对于氧三发射体是。研究结果表明，光度夸asar并不一定位于早期宇宙中最密集的区域，而且这些红移处的紫外光夸asar活跃周期fduty≪1。这种短暂的夸asar活动周期挑战了我们对早期超大质量黑洞生长的理解，并为高度尘埃遮挡的生长阶段或间歇的，辐射低效的吸积率提供了证据。 <div>
We expect luminous (M1450 ≲ −26.5) high-redshift quasars to trace the highest-density peaks in the early Universe. Here, we present observations of four z ≳ 6 quasar fields using JWST/NIRCam in the imaging and wide-field slitless spectroscopy mode and report a wide range in the number of detected [O iii]-emitting galaxies in the quasars’ environments, ranging between a density enhancement of δ ≈ 65 within a 2 cMpc radius—one of the largest protoclusters during the Epoch of Reionization discovered to date—to a density contrast consistent with zero, indicating the presence of a UV-luminous quasar in a region comparable to the average density of the Universe. By measuring the two-point cross-correlation function of quasars and their surrounding galaxies, as well as the galaxy autocorrelation function, we infer a correlation length of quasars at 〈z〉 = 6.25 of , while we obtain a correlation length of the [O iii]-emitting galaxies of . By comparing the correlation functions to dark-matter-only simulations we estimate the minimum mass of the quasars’ host dark matter halos to be (and for the [O iii] emitters), indicating that (a) luminous quasars do not necessarily reside within the most overdense regions in the early Universe, and that (b) the UV-luminous duty cycle of quasar activity at these redshifts is fduty ≪ 1. Such short quasar activity timescales challenge our understanding of early supermassive black hole growth and provide evidence for highly dust-obscured growth phases or episodic, radiatively inefficient accretion rates.

<div> 年轻恒星，Upper Sco，吸积爆发，出流迹象，伴星，光谱天文学

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了位于Upper Sco的一个年轻恒星2MASS J16075796-2040087，发现了其存在大约15天的吸积爆发和多组分禁止辐射线(FEL)所示的出流，这在其年龄上是不寻常的。研究表明，吸积爆发可能是由距离约4.6天文单位的伴星引发的。通过光谱天文学分析发现，FEL的高速组分(HVC)追踪着一个不对称的双极喷流，长约700天文单位，而低速发射线则与HVC更为相似，难以确定MHD盘风成分。作者提出了一个假设，即由于靠近伴星的恒星吸积爆发推动了喷流活动，而在这种活动通常在大多数恒星的年龄结束时停止。所研究的低速发射线可能来自于靠近伴星附近的缓慢喷流，与MHD风的发射混合在一起。 <div>
2MASS J16075796-2040087 is an ∼5 Myr young star in Upper Sco with evidence for accretion bursts on a timescale of about 15 days and, uncommonly for its age, outflows traced by multicomponent forbidden emission lines (FELs). The accretion bursts may be triggered by a companion at ∼4.6 au. We analyze HIRES spectra optimised for spectro-astrometry to better understand the origin of the several FEL velocity components and determine whether a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disk wind is present. The FEL high-velocity component (HVC) traces an asymmetric, bipolar jet ∼700 au long. The jet’s position angle ∼ 277° is not perpendicular to the disk. The lower-velocity emission, classified previously as a disk wind low-velocity component, is found to have more in common with the HVC and overall it is not possible to identify an MHD disk wind component. The spectro-astrometric signal of the low-velocity emission resembles those of jets and its density and ionisation fraction fall into the range of HVCs. We suggest a scenario where the accretion bursts due to the close companion power the jets past the age where such activity ends around most stars. The low-velocity emission here could come from a slow jet launched near the close companion and this emission would be blended with emission from the MHD wind.

<br /><br />总结:
这篇论文对旋转、磁化和稳定分层恒星的线性稳定性分析进行了系统修订。对于Bϕ的合理配置，不稳定性需要扩散过程：粘性、磁扩散率或热量/成分扩散。我们的结果展示了一个新的物理图景，证明了不同扩散效应独立地触发了旋转恒星中两种波的不稳定性：磁流线波和惯性波。它通过波的过稳定性发展，其增长率在一些特征波数急剧达到峰值。我们确定了每种波分支的不稳定条件，并找到了特征波数。对于磁普朗数Pm ≪ 1（例如太阳）和Pm ≫ 1（例如原中子星），不稳定模式的参数依赖性表明了可能的Tayler–Spruit发电机的非通用尺度。 <div>
Tayler instability of toroidal magnetic fields Bϕ is broadly invoked as a trigger for turbulence and angular momentum transport in stars. This paper presents a systematic revision of the linear stability analysis for a rotating, magnetized, and stably stratified star. For plausible configurations of Bϕ, instability requires diffusive processes: viscosity, magnetic diffusivity, or thermal/compositional diffusion. Our results reveal a new physical picture, demonstrating how different diffusive effects independently trigger instability of two types of waves in the rotating star: magnetostrophic waves and inertial waves. It develops via overstability of the waves, whose growth rate sharply peaks at some characteristic wavenumbers. We determine instability conditions for each wave branch and find the characteristic wavenumbers. The results are qualitatively different for stars with magnetic Prandtl number Pm ≪ 1 (e.g., the Sun) and Pm ≫ 1 (e.g., protoneutron stars). The parameter dependence of unstable modes suggests a nonuniversal scaling of the possible Tayler–Spruit dynamo.

The aim of this study is to use multispacecraft measurements of interplanetary magnetic clouds (MCs) to better constrain and understand the effect of expansion on their magnetic field properties. We develop a parameter (γ) for comparing magnetic field components measured at multiple spacecraft. We use the minimum variance technique on the magnetic field data to obtain the axial and azimuthal components. The parameter γ acts at the front boundary as a measure of the global difference in the evolution with heliospheric distance of the axial and azimuthal magnetic field components of MCs. Our goal is to determine whether the studied MCs exhibit self-similar expansion and, if so, whether this expansion is predominantly isotropic or radial, based on the estimated γ. Through our analysis of data from multiple spacecraft, we observe a notable consistency in the γ values across the examples examined. We find that the overall expansion of these MCs tends to be isotropic, while the local expansion of MCs, derived from the γ values measured at the rear boundary of MCs, usually shows anisotropic behavior, particularly when the distances between the observations from the two spacecraft are relatively short. This discovery offers insights for refining flux rope models and advancing our comprehension of the expansion processes associated with coronal mass ejections.

<div> 关键词: Dark matter subhalos, Milky Way, LMC analog, stream encounter rates, FIRE-2 simulations

总结:
本文使用FIRE-2模拟了银河系质量的星系，展示了LMC模拟对流体-次哈洛相遇率的影响。LMC模拟带来了许多次哈洛，使得靠近这一大型卫星的流体的相遇率增加了10%至40%。此外，LMC模拟还使宿主星系偏离了质心位置，引起了反射运动，导致次哈洛的密度和径向速度分布出现南北不对称性。这种不对称性，与LMC模拟次哈洛的存在结合起来，导致了在相同距离处的相遇率在天空的不同位置上变化了50%至70%，尤其是在LMC模拟的相反位置上。此外，LMC模拟还在宿主暗物质晕中引起了密度尾迹，进一步提高了接近LMC模拟的相遇率。作者还探讨了流体轨道特性对相遇率的影响，发现相对LMC模拟轨道背行运动的流体，其相遇率在相反象限内增加了50%。最后，作者报告了银河系流体在模拟背景下的相遇率，分别考虑了有无LMC模拟的情况。相遇率依赖于流体位置、轨道和它们相对LMC的位置，这对于在哪里寻找在银河系中出现的带状和间隙的流体具有重要意义。 <div>
Dark matter subhalos are predicted to perturb stellar streams; stream morphologies and dynamics can, therefore, constrain the mass distribution of subhalos. Using FIRE-2 simulations of Milky Way–mass galaxies, we demonstrate that the presence of an LMC analog significantly changes stream–subhalo encounter rates. The LMC analog brings in many subhalos, increasing encounter rates for streams near the massive satellite by 10%–40%. Additionally, the LMC analog displaces the host from its center of mass (inducing reflex motion), which causes a north–south asymmetry in the density and radial velocity distributions of subhalos. This asymmetry, combined with the presence of LMC-analog subhalos, causes encounter rates at the same distance to vary by 50%–70% across the sky, particularly in regions opposite the LMC analog. Furthermore, the LMC analog induces a density wake in the host's dark matter halo, further boosting the encounter rates near the LMC analog. We also explore how stream orbital properties affect encounter rates, finding up to a 50% increase for streams moving retrograde to the LMC analog’s orbit in the opposite quadrant. Finally, we report the encounter rates for Milky Way streams within the context of our simulations, both with and without the presence of an LMC analog. The dependence of encounter rates on stream location, orbit, and their position relative to the LMC has important implications for where to search for streams with spurs and gaps in the Milky Way.

总结：<br /><br />本文探讨了通过模拟解决TOV方程的方法，包括多层感知器（MLPs）、高斯过程和一种数据驱动的简化基础方法（RBM）。研究发现，MLP型模拟器通常比其他两种算法更准确，而RBM则能够最大程度地加快处理TOV方程的速度。文章还展示了利用这些模拟器进行简单参数推断的应用，并显示我们的模拟器预测的后验概率与通过完整的TOV求解器获得的后验概率非常一致。 <div>
Gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron-star (BNS) mergers have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the nuclear equation of state (EOS) and the fundamental interactions that determine its properties. However, Bayesian parameter estimation frameworks do not typically sample over microscopic nuclear-physics parameters that determine the EOS. One of the major hurdles in doing so is the computational cost involved in solving the neutron-star structure equations, known as the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff (TOV) equations. In this paper, we explore approaches to emulating solutions for the TOV equations: multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), Gaussian processes, and a data-driven variant of the reduced basis method (RBM). We implement these emulators for three different parameterizations of the nuclear EOS, each with a different degree of complexity represented by the number of model parameters. We find that our MLP-based emulators are generally more accurate than the other two algorithms, whereas the RBM results in the largest speedup with respect to the full high-fidelity TOV solver. We employ these emulators for a simple parameter inference using a potentially loud BNS observation and show that the posteriors predicted by our emulators are in excellent agreement with those obtained from the full TOV solver.

A technique has recently been developed for tracking short-term spectral variations in Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) using data from a single neutron monitor (NM), by collecting histograms of the time delay between successive neutron counts and extracting the leader fraction L as a proxy of the spectral index. Here we analyze L from four Antarctic NMs from 2015 March to 2023 September. We have calibrated L from the South Pole NM with respect to a daily spectral index determined from published data of GCR proton fluxes during 2015–2019 from the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) on board the International Space Station. Our results demonstrate a robust correlation between the leader fraction and the spectral index fit over the rigidity range 2.97–16.6 GV for AMS-02 data, with uncertainty of 0.018 in the daily spectral index as inferred from L. In addition to the 11 yr solar activity cycle, a wavelet analysis confirms a 27 day periodicity in the GCR flux and spectral index corresponding to solar rotation, especially near sunspot minimum, while the flux occasionally exhibits a strong harmonic at 13.5 days. The magnetic field component along a nominal Parker spiral (i.e., the magnetic sector structure) is a strong determinant of such spectral and flux variations, with the solar wind speed exerting an additional, nearly rigidity-independent influence on flux variations. Our investigation affirms the capability of ground-based NM stations to accurately and continuously monitor cosmic-ray spectral variations over the long-term future.

This paper presents the global analysis of two extended decreases in the galactic cosmic-ray intensity observed by worldwide networks of ground-based detectors in 2012. This analysis is capable of separately deriving the cosmic-ray density (or omnidirectional intensity) and anisotropy, each as a function of time and rigidity. A simple diffusion model along the spiral field line between Earth and a cosmic-ray barrier indicates the long duration of these events, resulting from about 190° eastern extent of a barrier such as an interplanetary shock followed by the sheath region and/or the corotating interaction region (CIR). It is suggested that the coronal mass ejection merging with and compressing the preexisting CIR at its flank can produce such an extended barrier. The derived rigidity spectra of the density and anisotropy both vary in time during each event period. In particular we find that the temporal feature of the “phantom Forbush decrease (FD)” reported in an analyzed period is dependent on rigidity, and looks quite different at different rigidities. From these rigidity spectra of the density and anisotropy, we derive the rigidity spectrum of the average parallel mean free path of pitch angle scattering along the spiral field line and infer the power spectrum of the magnetic fluctuation and its temporal variation. The possible physical cause of the strong rigidity dependence of the phantom FD is also discussed. These results demonstrate the high-energy cosmic rays observed at Earth responding to remote space weather.

We report the timing and spectral studies of the accreting X-ray pulsar 4U 2206+54 using AstroSat and Insight-HXMT observations taken in 2016 and 2020 respectively. X-ray pulsations from the system are detected by both missions. The AstroSat discovered a significant periodic signal at ∼5619 s in 2016, and Insight-HXMT found a pulsation period at ∼5291 s in 2020. A comparison of its spin-period evolution with the present spin-period estimates shows that the neutron star in 4U 2206+54 now has recently been undergoing a spin-up episode after attaining to its slow pulsations of 5750 s around 2015 from its prolonged spin-down phase. The present average spin-up rate of the pulsar is found to be at ∼1.2 × 10−13 Hz s−1. The phase-averaged spectra of the pulsar in 1–60 keV could be explained with a high-energy cutoff power-law continuum model; no evident line features are found with AstroSat. The application of Comptonization models such as comptt and compmag to the phase-averaged spectra of 4U 2206+54 reveals a hotter source photon region near the pulsar with an emission size extending to ∼2–2.8 km. Using the quasi-spherical settling accretion theory, we explain the present spin-up and the possibility of the strong magnetic field of the pulsar.

Luminous accretion disks around black holes are expected to have densities of ∼1015−1022 cm−3, which are high enough that plasma physics effects become important. Many of these effects have been traditionally neglected in the calculation of atomic parameters, and therefore in photoionization models and ultimately also in X-ray reflection models. In this paper, we describe updates to the atomic rates used by the xstar code, which is in turn part of the xillver disk reflection model. We discuss the effect of adding necessary high-density corrections into the xillver code. Specifically, we find that the change of recombination rates plays an important role, dominating the differences between model versions. With synthetic spectra, we show that, even in a highly ionized state, high-density slabs can produce strong iron (∼6.5–9 keV) and oxygen (∼0.6–0.8 keV) resonance features. The significant iron emission could address the problem of the supersolar iron abundances found in some sources.

这篇论文发现了五个新的Heartbeat stars (HBSs)并且发现它们表现出了tidally excited oscillations (TEOs)，使用了TESS光度数据。通过修正Kumar等人的模型，利用Markov Chain Monte Carlo方法，得出了这些系统的轨道参数。对这些对象的TEOs进行了分析，并识别了它们的脉动相位和模式。提出TIC 266809405，TIC 266894805和TIC 412881444中的TEO脉动相位与主要的l = 2，m = 0或±2球谐波一致。 虽然TIC 11619404的TEO相位接近m = +2模式，但由于该系统的低倾角，m = 0模式也不能被排除。TIC 447927324的TEO相位与绝热期望有明显偏差(>2σ)，这表明它可能是一个行波，或者脉动是非绝热的。此外，这些TEOs发生在相对较低的轨道谐波上，我们谨慎地认为这可能是一种观测偏差。这些对象是研究偏心轨道双星结构和演化，以及扩展TESS HBS目录的宝贵资源。 <div>
Heartbeat stars (HBSs) with tidally excited oscillations (TEOs) are ideal astrophysical laboratories for studying the internal properties of the systems. In this paper, five new HBSs exhibiting TEOs are discovered using TESS photometric data. The orbital parameters are derived using a corrected version of Kumar et al.'s model based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. The TEOs in these objects are examined, and their pulsation phases and modes are identified. The pulsation phases of the TEOs in TIC 266809405, TIC 266894805, and TIC 412881444 are consistent with the dominant l = 2, m = 0, or ±2 spherical harmonic. For TIC 11619404, although the TEO phase is close to the m = +2 mode, the m = 0 mode cannot be excluded because of the low inclination in this system. The TEO phase in TIC 447927324 shows a large deviation (>2σ) from the adiabatic expectations, suggesting that it is expected to be a traveling wave or that the pulsations are nonadiabatic. In addition, these TEOs occur at relatively low orbital harmonics, and we cautiously suggest that this may be an observational bias. These objects are valuable sources for studying the structure and evolution of eccentricity orbit binaries and extending the TESS HBS catalog with TEOs.

Radio spectral shape of quasars can provide insight into the ages of quasars. We have compiled data for 1804 quasars with z ≲ 1 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Additionally, these quasars were also mapped by the Low-Frequency Array at 144 MHz and the Very Large Array Sky Survey at 3000 MHz. The radio spectral index, designated as (with S(ν) ∝ να), is analyzed between 144 and 3000 MHz as a proxy for the ages of quasars. We measure the [O III] λ5007 emission line in the SDSS spectra. A strong correlation was found between the equivalent width of the core component of the [O III] λ5007 emission line and . This relationship suggests that the core component of the [O III] λ5007 emission line could potentially serve as a surrogate for the evolutionary stage of a quasar. The quasars at an early stage of evolutions tend to show weaker [O III] λ5007 emission, while older quasars exhibit stronger [O III] λ5007 emission.

<title>Contribution of the Cygnus Bubble to the Galactic Cosmic Ray Spectrum and Diffuse γ-Ray Emissions</title>

Since the discovery of cosmic rays (CRs) over a century ago, their origin has remained a mystery and a key research question. Recently, the LHAASO experiment identified the first CR superacceleration source, the Cygnus bubble, which can accelerate CRs to energies exceeding 10 PeV. A pertinent question is how much the Cygnus bubble contributes to the CR spectrum observed on Earth. With the aim of answering that question, a 3D propagation analysis was conducted on CRs in this study. The Cygnus bubble was incorporated into our propagation model in order to determine its contributions to the observed spectra. First, we calculated the spectrum and spatial morphology of the Cygnus bubble to reproduce the observed LHAASO data. Subsequently, we calculated the diffuse γ-ray emissions produced by the CRs from the Cygnus bubble and the energy spectrum of the CR particles near Earth after propagation. Finally, we utilized a CR spatial-dependent propagation model to calculate the large-scale CR energy spectrum and the resulting diffuse γ-ray emissions. Our results indicate that (1) the Cygnus bubble contributes minimally to the CR spectrum observed on Earth, (2) the emissions produced by the CR particles from the Cygnus bubble dominate the diffuse γ-ray emissions in that region, and (3) the structural fluctuations of the diffuse γ-ray emissions observed by LHAASO are likely due to the local CR halo. We anticipate that LHAASO will identify more CR halo sources to validate our model.

<title>Instability and Evolution of Shocked Clouds Formed by Orthogonal Collisions between Magnetized Filamentary Molecular Clouds</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Filamentary molecular clouds are recognized as primary sites for the formation of stars. Specifically, regions characterized by the overlapping point of multiple filaments, known as hub regions, are often associated with active star formation. However, the formation mechanism of this hub structure is not well understood. Therefore, to understand the formation mechanism and star formation in hub structures, as a first step, we investigate the orthogonal collisions between two filaments using three-dimensional ideal magnetohydrodynamical simulations. As a model of initial filaments, we use an infinitely long filament in magnetohydrostatic equilibrium under a global magnetic field running perpendicular to the filament axis. Two identical equilibrium filaments, sharing the same magnetic flux, are arranged with their long axes perpendicular to each other and given an initial velocity perpendicular to their long axes to replicate an orthogonal collision. We find three types of evolution after the shocked cloud is formed: collapse, stable, and expansion modes. The energy balance just after the filaments completely collide explains the future evolution of the shocked cloud. If the magnitude of gravitational energy is larger than the sum of the kinetic, thermal, and magnetic energies, the shocked cloud evolves in collapse mode. If the magnitude of gravitational energy is less than the sum of these energies, the cloud evolves in stable mode when the kinetic energy is relatively small and in expansion mode when the kinetic energy is sufficiently large.

Inspired by the entropy–area relation of black hole thermodynamics, we study the thermodynamics of the cosmological apparent horizon in a spatially flat Friedmann–Robertson–Walker universe in the framework of an extended uncertainty principle (EUP). The adopted EUP naturally admits a minimal measurable momentum (equivalently a maximal measurable length), as an infrared cutoff in the theory. We derive the modified Friedmann equations in this setup and explore some predictions of these equations for the late-time universe via distance measures. We show that in this framework it is possible to realize the late-time cosmic speedup and transition to the phantom phase of the equation-of-state parameter of the effective cosmic fluid without recourse to any dark energy component or modified gravity. Inspection of various distance measures in this framework shows that an EUP with a negative deformation parameter suffices for the interpretation of the late-time asymptotically de Sitter universe with standard nonrelativistic matter.

总结:<br />
本研究利用Merian Survey的中等波段成像，对处于0.064 < z < 0.1红移范围内的一组星系进行了非参数形态学分析。我们提出了一种新方法，通过Merian Survey的N708中等波段滤光片来估计恒星连续发射，用于测量Hα发射并为我们的样本星系生成Hα图。我们测量了Hα和恒星连续图像的非参数形态统计量，探讨了Hα的形态与连续图像的差异，并研究了这些参数随星系物理特性的演变。与先前针对更质量较大星系的结果一致，我们发现恒星连续的不对称性随特定星形成率（sSFR）增加而增加，并将这一趋势扩展到质量较低的星系，同时也表明这一趋势适用于Hα发射的不对称性。我们发现具有最高sSFR的质量最低的星系的Hα发射一致地表现出不均匀和紧凑，而在此质量范围内不太活跃的星系的Hα发射似乎 diffus。在更高质量的星系中，我们的数据范围不足以评估类似的趋势是否适用。我们得出结论，低质量星系中的高sSFR可能是由于动力学不稳定性导致星系的分子气体被压缩到中心附近的密集区域。 <div>
Using medium-band imaging from the newly released Merian Survey, we conduct a nonparametric morphological analysis of Hα emission maps and stellar continua for a sample of galaxies with at 0.064 < z < 0.1. We present a novel method for estimating the stellar continuum emission through the Merian Survey’s N708 medium-band filter, which we use to measure Hα emission and produce Hα maps for our sample of galaxies with seven-band Merian photometry and available spectroscopy. We measure nonparametric morphological statistics for the Hα and stellar continuum images, explore how the morphology of the Hα differs from the continuum, and investigate how the parameters evolve with the galaxies’ physical properties. In agreement with previous results for more massive galaxies, we find that the asymmetry of the stellar continuum increases with specific star formation rate (sSFR), and we extend the trend to lower masses, also showing that it holds for the asymmetry of the Hα emission. We find that the lowest-mass galaxies with the highest sSFR have Hα emission that is consistently heterogeneous and compact, while the less active galaxies in this mass range have Hα emission that appears diffuse. At higher masses, our data do not span a sufficient range in sSFR to evaluate whether similar trends apply. We conclude that high sSFRs in low-mass galaxies likely result from dynamical instabilities that compress a galaxy’s molecular gas to a dense region near the center.

解析模型用于解释星系中超新星遗迹的亮度和直径之间关系，在低密度气泡和多密度的环境中进行了模拟和分析。模型表明，超新星遗迹与多密度介质碰撞会导致亮度的增加，然后随着距离增加呈现更陡峭的下降趋势。模型分析还表明，多密度介质的影响在直径约为14 pc时开始显著，并会导致散射的观测数据。然而，还需要进一步分析选择效应，并改进模型以考虑辐射损失和热传导。

We present an analytical model of the Σ–D relation for supernova remnants (SNRs) evolving in a clumpy medium. The model and its approximations were developed using the hydrodynamic simulations of SNRs in environments of low-density bubbles and clumpy media with different densities and volume filling factors. For calculation of SNR luminosities we developed the synchrotron emission model, implying the test-particle approximation. The goal of this work is to explain the flattened part of the Σ–D relation for Galactic SNRs at D ≈ 14–50 pc. Our model shows that the shock collision with the clumpy medium initially enhances the brightness of individual SNRs, which is followed by a steeper fall of their Σ–D curve. We used the analytical model to generate large SNR samples on the Σ–D plane, within a span of different densities and distances to the clumpy medium, keeping the observed distribution of diameters. After comparison with the Galactic sample, we conclude that the observed Σ–D flattening and scatter originate in sporadic emission jumps of individual SNRs while colliding with the dense clumps. Statistically, the significant impact of the clumps starts at diameters of ≈14 pc, up to ∼70 pc, with the average density jump at the clumpy medium of ∼220 times, roughly depending on the low density of the circumstellar region. However, additional analysis considering the selection effects is needed, as well as improvement of the model, considering radiation losses and thermal conduction.

Here are analyzed 3D velocity distribution functions (VDFs) of protons in the suprathermal energy-per-charge (E/Q) domain of 6.2 to 223.1 keV/e, as observed by the WIND Suprathermal Ion Composition Spectrometer (WIND/STICS) between 1995 and 2019, upon passage of interplanetary (IP) shocks. “Suprathermal” designates energies above the bulk, “thermal” solar wind, including inner-source pickup ions, cometary ions, solar energetic particles, and suprathermal tail particles. Within the WIND/STICS measurements, here treated as a standalone data set, only 3D VDFs within 9 hr prior to and following the shock passage are selected, as identified by the Center for Astrophysics (CfA) Harvard Interplanetary Shock Database. These are subsequently averaged, first over the STICS field of view, then over 3 hr intervals in the 9 hr about the shock. The averages, with errors assuming Poisson statistics, are then fitted using the Levenburg–Marquardt nonlinear least squares technique to two simple, observationally suggested functions arising from diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) formalism: a power law in E/Q with spectral index (model I), and a power-law with exponential rollover having a cutoff in E/Q (model II). The first result is a comparison of upstream spectral indices, e-folding energies, and normalization constants with corresponding downstream values. The second is a comparison of fitted spectral indices against those given by measured CfA shock compression ratios and a comparison of fitted e-folding energies with those given by measured ratios and shock normal angles, per DSA-derived predictions. There is additionally a comparison between fitted parameters given by the two functional forms. Little agreement is found with values given by DSA.

We present the most precise measurements to date for the spatial extension and energy spectrum of the γ-ray region between a pulsar’s wind nebula and the interstellar medium, better known as the halo, present around Geminga and PSR B0656+14 (Monogem) using ∼2398 days of >1 TeV data collected by the HAWC observatory. We interpret the data using a physically motivated model for the diffuse γ-ray emission generated from positrons and electrons (e±) injected by the pulsar wind nebula and inverse Compton scattering with interstellar radiation fields. We find the morphologies of the regions inside these halos are characterized by an inhibited diffusion that are approximately three orders of magnitudes smaller than the Galactic average. We also obtain the e± emission efficiencies of 6.6% and 5.1%, respectively, for Geminga and Monogem. These results have remarkable consequences for the study of the particle diffusion in the region between the pulsar wind nebulae and the interstellar medium, and for the interpretation of the flux of positrons measured by the AMS-02 experiment above 10 GeV.

总结:<br /><br />2024年5月10日至11日的超级风暴是太空时代第二大的地磁风暴，也是唯一一个有同时的行星间数据的风暴。风暴的特征是一个+88 nT的突发冲击（SI+），随后是一个持续约9小时的三步风暴主相发展。造成第一个风暴主相的原因是快速前进的行星间冲击和一个南向的行星间磁场成分。第二个风暴主相的原因是太空剪切的加深和磁声波的压缩。第三个也是最强烈的风暴主相是由磁场强度增强引起的。风暴期间的一些效应包括地磁暴引起的极区电流流动、高能电子和宇宙射线通量的变化以及强烈的电离层电流流动。 <div>
The recent superstorm of 2024 May 10–11 is the second largest geomagnetic storm in the space age and the only one that has simultaneous interplanetary data (there were no interplanetary data for the 1989 March storm). The May superstorm was characterized by a sudden impulse (SI+) amplitude of +88 nT, followed by a three-step storm main-phase development, which had a total duration of ∼9 hr. The cause of the first storm main phase with a peak SYM-H intensity of −183 nT was a fast-forward interplanetary shock (magnetosonic Mach number Mms ∼ 7.2) and an interplanetary sheath with a southward interplanetary magnetic field component Bs of ∼40 nT. The cause of the second storm's main phase with an SYM-H intensity of −354 nT was a deepening of the sheath Bs to ∼43 nT. A magnetosonic wave (Mms ∼ 0.6) compressed the sheath to a high magnetic field strength of ∼71 nT. Intensified Bs of ∼48 nT were the cause of the third and most intense storm main phase, with an SYM-H intensity of −518 nT. Three magnetic cloud events with Bs fields of ∼25–40 nT occurred in the storm recovery phase, lengthening the recovery to ∼2.8 days. At geosynchronous orbit, ∼76 keV to ∼1.5 MeV electrons exhibited ∼1–3 orders of magnitude flux decreases following the shock/sheath impingement onto the magnetosphere. The cosmic-ray decreases at Dome C, Antarctica (effective vertical cutoff rigidity <0.01 GV) and Oulu, Finland (rigidity ∼0.8 GV) were ∼17% and ∼11%, respectively, relative to quiet-time values. Strong ionospheric current flows resulted in extreme geomagnetically induced currents of ∼30–40 A in the subauroral region. The storm period is characterized by strong polar-region field-aligned currents, with ∼10 times intensification during the main phase and equatorward expansion down to ∼50° geomagnetic (altitude-adjusted) latitude.

本研究通过比较星体边缘和气体分布来研究星系的生长和环境影响。我们发现一些矮星系在围绕簇和场区域的Dstellar ≫ DHI的情况下，平均H i表面密度约为0.3 M⊙ pc−2，显示出压制和外部气体去除的影响。与之相比，在矮星系中Dstellar/DHI在0.5和2之间，与星体反馈的预期一致。我们还发现了Dstellar–M⋆关系在mbreak ∼ 4 × 108M⊙处发生了突变，这可能区分了低质量星系的影响。这些结果突显了结合深度光学和H i成像对理解星系演化的重要性。 <br /><br /> <div>
Mapping stars and gas in nearby galaxies is fundamental for understanding their growth and the impact of their environment. This issue is addressed by comparing the stellar “edges” of galaxies Dstellar, defined as the outermost diameter where in situ star formation significantly drops, with the gaseous distribution parameterized by the neutral atomic hydrogen diameter measured at 1 M⊙ pc−2, DHI. By sampling a broad H i mass range 105M⊙ < MHI < 1011M⊙, we find several dwarf galaxies with MHI < 109M⊙ from the field and Fornax Cluster that are distinguished by Dstellar ≫ DHI. For the cluster dwarfs, the average H i surface density near Dstellar is ∼0.3 M⊙ pc−2, reflecting the impact of quenching and outside-in gas removal from ram pressure and tidal interactions. In comparison, Dstellar/DHI ranges between 0.5 and 2 in dwarf field galaxies, consistent with the expectations from stellar feedback. Only more massive disk galaxies in the field can thus be characterized by the common assumption that Dstellar ≲ DHI. We discover a break in the Dstellar–M⋆ relation at mbreak ∼ 4 × 108M⊙ that potentially differentiates the low-mass regime, where the influence of stellar feedback and environmental processes more prominently regulates the sizes of nearby galaxies. Our results highlight the importance of combining deep optical and H i imaging for understanding galaxy evolution.

总结:<br />
加拿大氢强度制图实验（CHIME）望远镜发现了12个非重复的快速射电暴（FRB）源。这些源被选自CHIME/FRB全阵列原始电压数据记录的数据库，其信噪比大且形态复杂。这些事件显示出各种独特的漂移现象，并具有微观结构特征。此外，报道了这些事件的极化特征，包括极化分数和法拉第旋转度量。这些爆发的形态特性与FRB辐射的相对论冲击和磁层模型以及通过离散电离等离子体结构的传播预测大致一致。我们还讨论了如何利用我们对形态学原型的改进理解来测试这些模型。 <div>
We present the discovery of 12 apparently nonrepeating fast radio burst (FRB) sources, detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) telescope. These sources, only one of which has been presented previously in the first CHIME/FRB catalog, were selected from a database comprising CHIME/FRB full-array raw voltage data recordings, based on their large signal-to-noise ratios and complex morphologies. Our study examines the time-frequency characteristics of these bursts, including drifting, microstructure, and periodicities. The events in this sample display a variety of unique drifting phenomenologies that deviate from the linear negative drifting phenomenon seen in many repeating FRBs, and motivate a possible new framework for classifying drifting archetypes. Additionally, we detect microstructure features of duration ≲50 μs in seven events, with some as narrow as ≃7 μs. We find no evidence of significant periodicities between subburst components. Furthermore, we report the polarization characteristics of seven events, including their polarization fractions and Faraday rotation measures (RMs). The observed ∣RM∣ values span a wide range of 17.24(2)–328.06(2) rad m−2, with apparent linear polarization fractions between 0.340(1) and 0.946(3). The morphological properties of the bursts in our sample appear broadly consistent with predictions from both relativistic shock and magnetospheric models of FRB emission, as well as propagation through discrete ionized plasma structures. We address these models and discuss how they can be tested using our improved understanding of morphological archetypes.

ALMA进行了1.2毫米波段的观测，发现IRAS16547-E和IRAS16547-W周围存在具有双锥结构的尘埃包层，受到热射电喷流的影响。观测还显示磁场向量与双锥包层的结构密切相关，极化分数约为2.0%。同时，分子线H13CO+和HN13C的速度梯度与磁场有很好的对应关系，可能追踪了分子流的空腔或在某些部分存在向内运动。研究还发现一些区域的磁场强度在2到6.1 mG之间。此外，CS(5−4)分子线的发射显示出多个流出空腔或驶向不同方向的弓形冲击波，其中一些似乎沿着西北-东南方向的热射电喷流运动。
<br /><br />总结: 本文利用ALMA进行了高角分辨率观测，揭示了大质量原恒星周围的尘埃包层结构和磁场特征。研究发现磁场与尘埃包层紧密相关，速度梯度与磁场对应，揭示了磁场在大质量星形成早期进化阶段的重要作用。 <div>
The formation of the massive stars, and in particular, the role that the magnetic fields play in their early evolutionary phase is still far from being completely understood. Here, we present the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array 1.2 mm full polarized continuum and H13CO+(3−2), CS(5−4), and HN13C(3−2) line observations with a high angular resolution (∼0.″4 or 1100 au). In the 1.2 mm continuum emission, we reveal a dusty envelope surrounding the massive protostars, IRAS16547-E and IRAS16547-W, with dimensions of ∼10,000 au. This envelope has a biconical structure likely carved by the powerful thermal radio jet present in region. The magnetic field vectors follow very well the biconical envelope. The polarization fraction is ∼2.0% in this region. Some of these vectors seem to converge to IRAS 16547-E and IRAS 16547-W, the most massive protostars. Moreover, the velocity fields revealed from the spectral lines H13CO+(3−2) and HN13C(3−2) show velocity gradients with a good correspondence with the magnetic fields, which maybe are tracing the cavities of molecular outflows or maybe infalling in some parts. We derived a magnetic field strength in some filamentary regions that goes from 2 to 6.1 mG. We also find that the CS(5−4) molecular line emission reveals multiple outflow cavities or bow shocks with different orientations, some of which seem to follow the NW–SE radio thermal jet.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用AKARI/红外相机研究了多环芳烃（PAH）尘埃排放对宇宙星系中的星形成率的指标作用。通过观测443个星系的光谱并使用光谱诊断方法推断星系的星形成率。研究发现，PAH与24μm的Hα发射光度呈线性关系，但仅限于正常的星形“主序”星系。此外，研究还发现PAH星形成率密度（SFRD）与远红外的SFRD一致，在z∼1时比未校正的UV观测高一个数量级。在z∼1时，星爆星系对总SFRD的贡献超过主序星系，达到总SFRD的0.7以上。 <div>
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) dust emission has been proposed as an effective extinction-independent star formation rate (SFR) indicator in the mid-infrared, but this may depend on conditions in the interstellar medium. The coverage of the AKARI/Infrared Camera (IRC) allows us to study the effects of metallicity, starburst intensity, and active galactic nuclei on PAH emission in galaxies with fν (L18W) ≲ 19 AB mag. Observations include follow-up, rest-frame optical spectra of 443 galaxies within the AKARI North Ecliptic Pole survey that have IRC detections from 7 to 24 μm. We use optical emission line diagnostics to infer SFR based on Hα and [O ii]λλ3726, 3729 emission line luminosities. The PAH 6.2 μm and PAH 7.7 μm luminosities (L(PAH 6.2 μm) and L(PAH 7.7 μm), respectively) derived using multiwavelength model fits are consistent with those derived from slitless spectroscopy within 0.2 dex. L(PAH 6.2 μm) and L(PAH 7.7 μm) correlate linearly with the 24 μm dust-corrected Hα luminosity only for normal, star-forming “main-sequence” galaxies. Assuming multilinear correlations, we quantify the additional dependencies on metallicity and starburst intensity, which we use to correct our PAH SFR calibrations at 0 < z < 1.2 for the first time. We derive the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) per comoving volume from 0.15 ≲ z ≲ 1. The PAH SFRD is consistent with that of the far-infrared and reaches an order of magnitude higher than that of uncorrected UV observations at z ∼ 1. Starburst galaxies contribute ≳0.7 of the total SFRD at z ∼ 1 compared to main-sequence galaxies.

总结:
本研究使用GALEX的近紫外线和远紫外线图像对551个近距离（D < 100 Mpc）的边缘盘星系进行了搜索，发现了广泛存在的星系外发射，其尺度高度为1-2.3千秒差距，大约有10%的（泛红的）流量在μB = 25等视星等/角秒²的B带等视等级之外。额外的发射在7%的个别星系中被探测到，另外三分之一的星系至少有5%的总流量在μB = 25等视等级/角秒²的B带等视星等之外在一个盘组件。额外的发射光度和颜色与反射星云一致，而不是恒星晕，并且表明平均而言，盘状星系的星系外尘埃质量为其星际介质质量的5%-15%。这表明，回收材料至少占了∼L*星系内部星系环境介质（R < 10 kpc）的三分之一。 <div>
Circumgalactic dust grains trace the circulation of mass and metals between star-forming regions and gaseous galactic halos, giving insight into feedback and tidal stripping processes. We perform a search for ultraviolet (UV) reflection nebulae produced by extraplanar dust around 551 nearby (D < 100 Mpc), edge-on disk galaxies using archival near-ultraviolet and far-ultraviolet images from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), accounting for the point-spread function (FWHM = 4″–5″). We detect extraplanar emission ubiquitously in stacks of galaxies binned by morphology and star formation rate, with scale heights of hh = 1–2.3 kpc and ≈10% of the total (reddened) flux in the galaxy found beyond the B-band isophotal level of μB = 25 mag arcsec−2. This emission is detected in 7% of the individual galaxies, and an additional one-third have at least 5% of their total flux found beyond μB = 25 mag arcsec−2 in a disk component. The extraplanar luminosities and colors are consistent with reflection nebulae rather than stellar halos and indicate that, on average, disk galaxies have an extraplanar dust mass of 5%–15% of that in their interstellar medium. This suggests that recycled material composes at least a third of the inner circumgalactic medium (R < 10 kpc) in ∼L* galaxies.

<br />总结:<br />本研究使用高频监测数据和XMM-Newton观测结果，首次检测到了源自内部吸积流的软滞后现象。此外，同时测量了X射线回波和UVOIR盘吸收的时间滞后，有效地绘制了黑洞周围整个吸积盘的图像。研究发现低时间频率产生的UVOIR时间滞后要比标准吸积盘吸收预期的时间滞后长2-3倍。模拟滞后需额外约束的再处理，与Hβ滞后测量结果一致。当将光曲线分成不同部分时，UVOIR滞后表现出明显的变化，当离子化流的遮挡最严重时，滞后最大，我们推测此时BLR的再处理会显著延长滞后。随着风的减弱，滞后会受到较短的吸积盘滞后的主导。 <div>
X-ray reverberation mapping is a powerful technique for probing the innermost accretion disk, whereas continuum reverberation mapping in the UV, optical, and infrared (UVOIR) reveals reprocessing by the rest of the accretion disk and broad-line region (BLR). We present the time lags of Mrk 817 as a function of temporal frequency measured from 14 months of high-cadence monitoring from Swift and ground-based telescopes, in addition to an XMM-Newton observation, as part of the AGN STORM 2 campaign. The XMM-Newton lags reveal the first detection of a soft lag in this source, consistent with reverberation from the innermost accretion flow. These results mark the first simultaneous measurement of X-ray reverberation and UVOIR disk reprocessing lags—effectively allowing us to map the entire accretion disk surrounding the black hole. Similar to previous continuum reverberation mapping campaigns, the UVOIR time lags arising at low temporal frequencies are longer than those expected from standard disk reprocessing by a factor of 2–3. The lags agree with the anticipated disk reverberation lags when isolating short-timescale variability, namely timescales shorter than the Hβ lag. Modeling the lags requires additional reprocessing constrained at a radius consistent with the BLR size scale inferred from contemporaneous Hβ-lag measurements. When we divide the campaign light curves, the UVOIR lags show substantial variations, with longer lags measured when obscuration from an ionized outflow is greatest. We suggest that, when the obscurer is strongest, reprocessing by the BLR elongates the lags most significantly. As the wind weakens, the lags are dominated by shorter accretion disk lags.

<div> 超巨星，质量损失，MESA，赤色超巨星，蓝色超巨星
总结:
这篇文章讨论了大质量恒星中可能存在的喷发性质量损失机制，该机制与恒星外层的超Eddington光度相关。研究者在MESA星演化模拟中实现了这个1D模型，并发现质量损失可达每年约10^-2太阳质量。研究指出，这种喷发性质量损失可能导致质量大于20太阳质量的恒星不再演化为红超巨星，而是变成蓝超巨星，从而解释了观测到的这一质量范围内红超巨星的缺失。 <div>
Eruptive mass loss in massive stars is known to occur, but the mechanism(s) are not yet well understood. One proposed physical explanation appeals to opacity-driven super-Eddington luminosities in stellar envelopes. Here, we present a 1D model for eruptive mass loss and implement this model in the MESA stellar evolution code. The model identifies regions in the star where the energy associated with a local super-Eddington luminosity exceeds the binding energy of the overlaying envelope. The material above such regions is ejected from the star. Stars with initial masses of 10−100 M⊙ at solar and SMC metallicities are evolved through core helium burning, with and without this new eruptive mass-loss scheme. We find that eruptive mass loss of up to ∼10−2M⊙yr−1 can be driven by this mechanism, and occurs in a vertical band on the H-R diagram between . This predicted eruptive mass loss prevents stars of initial masses ≳20 M⊙ from evolving to become red supergiants (RSGs), with the stars instead ending their lives as blue supergiants, and offers a possible explanation for the observed lack of RSGs in that mass regime.

总结:
本研究使用FLASH代码进行三维宇宙射线磁流体动力学模拟，预测了端对端活跃星系核喷流充气泡的射电形态，考虑了强子发射。我们发现，强大且持续时间较长的CRp主导喷流可以在质量较低的暗物质团中产生类似大小（∼300–600 kpc）和射电形态（圆形和边缘增亮）的ORCs气泡。在相同输入喷流能量的情况下，持续时间较长（因此功率较低）的喷流往往会产生较大的气泡，因为高功率喷流会产生强大的激波，带走了喷流能量的相当部分。由于效率高的强子碰撞在气泡和环境介质的界面上，自然产生了ORCs的边缘增亮特征。我们进一步讨论了射电亮度、X射线可检测性以及在星系演化背景下此类强AGN喷流的可能起源。我们得出结论，端对端CR主导的AGN气泡可能是ORCs形成的合理情景。 <br /><br /> <div>
Odd radio circles (ORCs) are newly discovered extragalactic radio objects with an unknown origin. In this work, we carry out three-dimensional cosmic-ray (CR) magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the FLASH code and predict the radio morphology of end-on active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet-inflated bubbles considering hadronic emission. We consider CR proton (CRp)-dominated jets as they tend to inflate oblate bubbles, promising to reproduce the large inferred sizes of the ORCs when viewed end-on. We find that powerful and long-duration CRp-dominated jets can create bubbles with similar sizes (∼300–600 kpc) and radio morphology (circular and edge-brightened) to the observed ORCs in low-mass (Mvir ∼ 8 × 1012 − 8 × 1013M⊙) halos. Given the same amount of input jet energy, longer-duration (thus lower-power) jets tend to create larger bubbles since high-power jets generate strong shocks that carry away a significant portion of the jet energy. The edge-brightened feature of the observed ORCs is naturally reproduced due to efficient hadronic collisions at the interface between the bubbles and the ambient medium. We further discuss the radio luminosity, X-ray detectability, and the possible origin of such strong AGN jets in the context of galaxy evolution. We conclude that end-on CR-dominated AGN bubbles could be a plausible scenario for the formation of ORCs.

Based on the data from the Kodaikanal and Mount Wilson observatories, we investigate the relationships of the tilt angles of sunspot groups, including the mean tilt angle and the tilt-angle scatter, during the declining phase with the parameters of the next solar cycle (SC). The main findings are summarized in the following three points. (1) During the declining phase, the correlation between the mean tilt angle and the tilt-angle scatter is statistically insignificant. (2) Six quantities measured during the declining phase show significant anticorrelations with the strength and amplitude of the next SC and positive correlations with the duration of the ascending phase of the next SC: the standard deviation of the tilt angles, the rms tilt angle, the mean absolute value of the tilt angles, the area-weighted absolute value of the tilt angles, the latitude-weighted absolute value of the tilt angles, and the area- and latitude-weighted absolute value of the tilt angles. (3) The correlations of the mean tilt angle, the area-weighted tilt angle, the latitude-weighted tilt angle, and the area- and latitude-weighted tilt angle during the declining phase with the strength, amplitude, and duration of the ascending phase of the next SC are statistically insignificant. These findings demonstrate that the modulation of the parameters of the next SC by the tilt-angle scatter during the declining phase plays a vital role in regulating SC variability.

<div> 关键词: 主序序列，脉冲星，电子回旋激射辐射，磁层密度，星磁层结构
总结:
主序序列脉冲星是一种产生相干射电脉冲的磁早型恒星，其辐射机制为电子回旋激射辐射。这种辐射具有高指向性和窄带宽的特点，且极化度极高。本文通过对一颗后B型主序序列脉冲星HD 133880进行超宽带观测，并通过不同频率下脉冲到达时间的差异来提取等离子体分布信息，发现恒星磁层具有倾斜的盘状过密度，且密度主要集中在中等频率范围。这些结果支持了最近对于热恒星离心支撑磁层的密度模型，为早型恒星磁层操作提供了进一步的动机，并提供了对大尺度恒星磁层中电子回旋激射辐射现象的全面描述。 <div>
Main-sequence radio pulse emitters (MRPs) are magnetic early-type stars that produce coherent radio emission observed in the form of periodic radio pulses. The emission mechanism behind this is the electron-cyclotron maser emission (ECME). Among all kinds of magnetospheric emission, ECME is unique due to its high directivity and intrinsically narrow bandwidth. The emission is also highly circularly polarized and the sign of polarization is opposite for the two magnetic hemispheres. This combination of properties makes ECME highly sensitive to the three-dimensional structures in the stellar magnetospheres. This is especially significant for late-B and A-type magnetic stars that do not emit other types of magnetospheric emission such as Hα, the key probe used to trace magnetospheric densities. In this paper, we use an ultra-wideband observation (0.4–2 GHz) of a late B-type MRP HD 133880 to demonstrate how we can extract information on plasma distribution from ECME. We achieve this by examining the differences in pulse arrival times (“lags”) as a function of frequencies and qualitatively comparing those with lags obtained by simulating ECME ray paths in hot stars’ magnetospheres. This reveals that the stellar magnetosphere has a disk-like overdensity inclined to the magnetic equator with a centrally concentrated density that primarily affects the intermediate frequencies (400–800 MHz). This result, which is consistent with the recent density model proposed for hotter centrifugally supported magnetospheres, lends support to the idea of a unifying model for magnetospheric operations in early-type stars, and also provides further motivation to fully characterize the ECME phenomenon in large-scale stellar magnetospheres.

<div> 高红移星系、He/H比率、局部矮星系、He过量、电子密度
总结:<br /><br />本文研究了三个红移较高的星系中He i/Hβ flux和He/H丰度比率，发现这些高红移星系表现出强烈的He i发射，He i/Hβ flux比率一般大于局部矮星系。对于高红移星系，He/H值大于0.10或电子密度ne ∼ 103−4 cm−3，远高于局部星系的值。作者发现He/H和N/O或ne–N/O平面间存在正相关关系。这表明高红移星系中的氦过量和氮过量无法用标准恒星爆炸的化学丰度来解释，而可能是由CNO循环产物和平衡比例所导致，或者是由于过多碰撞激发造成的。 <div>
We present He i/Hβ flux and He/H abundance ratios in three James Webb Space Telescope galaxies with significant constraints on N/O abundance ratios, GS-NDG-9422, RXCJ2248-ID, and GLASS150008 at z ∼ 6 mostly with the spectroscopic coverage from He iλ4471 and He iiλ4686 to He iλ7065, and comparing with 68 local dwarf galaxies. We find that these high-z galaxies present strong He i emission with He i/Hβ flux ratios generally larger than those of local dwarf galaxies. We derive He/H with all of the detected Hei, He ii, and 2−3 hydrogen Balmer lines in the same manner as the local He/H determination conducted for cosmology studies. These high-z galaxies show He overabundance He/H ≳0.10 or high electron density of ne ∼ 103−4 cm−3 much larger than local values at low O/H, . In contrast, we obtain low He/H and ne values for our local dwarf galaxies by the same technique with the same helium and hydrogen lines, and confirm that the difference between the high-z and local dwarf galaxies is not mimicked by systematics. While two scenarios of (1) He overabundance and (2) high electron density are not clearly concluded, we find that there is a positive correlation between the He/H–N/O or ne–N/O plane by the comparison of the high-z and local dwarf galaxies. Scenario (1) suggests that the overabundant helium and nitrogen are not explained by the standard chemical enrichment of core-collapse supernovae, but by the CNO-cycle products and equilibrium ratios, respectively. Scenario (2) indicates that the strong helium lines originated from the central dense clouds of the high-z galaxies by excessive collisional excitation.

<br /><br />总结: neutron star mergers产生r过程元素，GSE中出现了与[Mg/H]增加相关的[Eu/Mg]上升现象，化学演化模型表明这可能是由即时和延迟的r过程丰富事件相互作用造成的，未来需要更低金属贫瘠星的研究来了解GSE中r过程来源及其丰富过程。 <div>
Neutron star mergers (NSMs) produce r-process elements after a time-delayed inspiral process. Once a significant number of NSMs are present in a galaxy, r-process elements, such as Eu, are expected to significantly increase with time. Yet, there have been limited observational data in support of Eu increasing within Local Group galaxies. We have obtained high-resolution Magellan/MIKE observations of 43 metal-poor stars in the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus (GSE) tidally disrupted galaxy with −2.5 < [Fe/H] < −1. For the first time, we find a clear rise in [Eu/Mg] with increasing [Mg/H] within one galaxy. We use a simple chemical evolution model to study how such a rise can result from the interplay of prompt and delayed r-process enrichment events. Delayed r-process sources are required to explain the rise and subsequent leveling off of [Eu/Mg] in this disrupted galaxy. However, the rise may be explained by delayed r-process sources with either short (∼10 Myr) or long (∼500 Myr) minimum delay times. Future studies on the nature of r-process sources and their enrichment processes in the GSE will require additional stars in the GSE at even lower metallicities than the present study.

总结: 本文研究了R值变化与X级耀斑在太阳活动区的可能关系，采用Solar Dynamic Observatory的磁场数据进行推算，并在光球以上的区域计算R值。研究表明，在低太阳大气中存在潜在高度范围，即最佳高度范围（OHR），其中R值急剧增加。此外，对于新出现的AR，X级耀斑前的R值演变与非爆发性AR明显不同。对于非新出现的AR，无法找到OHR。这些发现有助于改进耀斑预测方法。 <br /><br /> <div>
The R-value is a measure of the strength of photospheric magnetic polarity inversion lines in active regions (ARs). This work investigates the possibility of a relation between R-value variations and the occurrence of X-class flares in ARs, not in the solar photosphere, as usual, but above it in regions closer to where flares occur. The modus operandi is to extrapolate the Solar Dynamic Observatory’s Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager magnetogram data up to a height of 3.24 Mm above the photosphere and then compute the R-value based on the extrapolated magnetic field. Recent studies have shown that certain flare-predictive parameters such as the horizontal gradient of the vertical magnetic field and magnetic helicity may improve flare prediction lead times significantly if studied at a specific height range above the photosphere, called the optimal height range (OHR). Here, we define the OHR as a collection of heights where a sudden but sustained increase in R-value is found. For the eight case studies discussed in this paper, our results indicate that it is possible for OHRs to exist in the low solar atmosphere (between 0.36 and 3.24 Mm), where R-value spikes occur 48–68 hr before the first X-class flare of an emerging AR. The temporal evolution of R-value before the first X-class flare for an emerging AR is also found to be distinct from that of nonflaring ARs. For X-class flares associated with nonemerging ARs, an OHR could not be found.

总结:<br />
研究利用NIRCam首次公开了北黄道极时域领域的0.9-4.4μm图像，发现了在核心呈现点状特征的星系。研究通过GalFit对66个星系进行了二维光线分布建模，并在16个星系中找到了有可测量的点光源成分的银河核。此外，通过光谱能量分布建模推断了这些星系的活动星系核和宿主星系参数，发现这些近红外点源银河核是AGN的标志。研究还定义了自动样本选择标准，可用于识别具有未解决的红外明亮AGN的星系。这表明詹姆斯·韦伯空间望远镜在红外波长的超凡角分辨率和灵敏度正在重振AGN的形态识别。 <div>
The first public 0.9–4.4 μm NIRCam images of the North Ecliptic Pole Time Domain Field uncovered galaxies displaying point-source features in their cores as seen in the longer-wavelength filters. We visually identified a sample of 66 galaxies (∼1 galaxy arcmin–2) with pointlike cores and have modeled their two-dimensional light profiles with GalFit, identifying 16 galactic nuclei with measurable point-source components. GalFit suggests that the visual sample is a mix of both compact stellar bulge and point-source galaxy cores. This core classification is complemented by spectral energy distribution modeling to infer the sample’s active galactic nucleus (AGN) and host-galaxy parameters. For galaxies with measurable point-source components, the median fractional AGN contribution to their 0.1–30.0 μm flux is 0.44, and 14/16 are color-classified AGN. We conclude that near-infrared point-source galaxy cores are signatures of AGN. In addition, we define an automated sample-selection criterion to identify these point-source features. This criterion can be used in other extant and future NIRCam images to streamline the search for galaxies with unresolved IR-luminous AGN. The James Webb Space Telescope’s superb angular resolution and sensitivity at infrared wavelengths are resurrecting the morphological identification of AGN.

通过MUSE Ultra Deep Field中的星系与两个明亮类星体的吸收线关联，探索星系特性对环星际介质中金属的依赖关系。研究利用超大望远镜（VLT）/MUSE数据和哈勃太空望远镜（HST）/G141M光栅观测，对两个类星体和几个波段的HST成像进行了比较。结果显示吸收线当量宽度与附近星系数量呈正相关，但在冲击参数方面没有显著的反相关。在全样本中，没有发现吸收体发生率随方位角的变化。然而，在小影响参数(<2 rvir)和高星形成星系周围的吸收角度分布呈双峰分布，这可能表明了盘状吸积和双锥出流。最后，没有发现吸收线星系对基本金属丰度关系的系统偏离。这项工作受当前数据波段覆盖范围的限制；使用James Webb太空望远镜的更广泛波长观测将允许我们充分发挥MUDF研究环星际介质的潜力。

We present initial results associating galaxies in the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) Ultra Deep Field (MUDF) with gas seen in absorption along the line of sight to two bright quasars in this field to explore the dependence of metals in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) on galaxy properties. The MUDF includes ∼140 hr of Very Large Telescope (VLT)/MUSE data and 90 orbits of Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/G141M grism observations alongside VLT/Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph spectroscopy of the two quasars and several bands of HST imaging. We compare the metal absorption around galaxies in this field as a function of impact parameter, azimuthal angle, and galaxy metallicity across redshifts 0.5 < z < 3.2. Due to the depth of our data and a large field of view, our analysis extends to low stellar masses (<107M⊙) and high impact parameters (>600 kpc). We find a correlation between the absorber equivalent width and the number of nearby galaxies, but do not detect a significant anticorrelation with the impact parameter. Our full sample does not show any significant change in absorber incidence as a function of azimuthal angle. However, we do find a bimodality in the azimuthal angle distribution of absorption at small impact parameters (<2 rvir) and around highly star-forming galaxies, possibly indicating disk-like accretion and biconical outflows. Finally, we do not detect any systematic deviation from the fundamental metallicity relation among galaxies with detected absorption. This work is limited by gaps in the wavelength coverage of our current data; broader-wavelength observations with the James Webb Space Telescope will allow us to unlock the full potential of the MUDF for studying the CGM.

<title>On the Flux Density Spectral Property of High Linearly Polarized Signal from Pulsar J0332+5434</title>

<div> 关键词: 线偏振, 脉冲星, 磁化等离子体, 频率演变, 弯曲辐射<br />
总结: 
本文研究了来自PSR J0332+5434的高线偏振信号的频谱特性，使用了Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope对300至750 MHz的频率范围进行了观测。研究发现，高线偏振时间样本在很大程度上呈现出宽带的特性，在轮廓明显的区域有时呈现出窄而尖锐的特征。这些尖锐特征在整个频率范围内都局限在一个窄的脉冲经度内，并且它们的光谱形状有时呈倒置抛物线形状。在所有这些情况下，位置角偏振（PPA）仅沿着一个正交的RVM轨迹，可能对应于X模式。从理论上讲，倒置的光谱形状可以通过大量带电孤立子（电荷团）的相干加成引起的X模式的弯曲辐射来解释。 <div>
The polarization position angles (PPA) of time samples with high linear polarization often show two parallel tracks across the pulsar profile that follow the rotating vector model (RVM). This feature supports coherent curvature radiation (CCR) as the underlying mechanism of radio emission from pulsars, where the parallel tracks of the PPA represent the orthogonal extraordinary (X) and ordinary (O) eigenmodes of strongly magnetized pair plasma. However, the frequency evolution of these high linearly polarized signals remains unexplored. In this work, we explore the flux density spectral nature of high linearly polarized signals by studying the emission from PSR J0332+5434 over a frequency range between 300 and 750 MHz, using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. The pulsar average profile comprises a central core and a pair of conal components. We find the high linearly polarized time samples to be broadband in nature, and in many cases, they resemble a narrow spiky feature in the conal regions. These spiky features are localized within a narrow pulse longitude over the entire frequency range, and their spectral shapes sometimes resemble an inverted parabolic shape. In all such cases, the PPA is exclusively along one of the orthogonal RVM tracks, likely corresponding to the X-mode. The inverted spectral shape can, in principle, be explained if the high linearly polarized emission in these time samples is formed due to the incoherent addition of CCR from a large number of charged solitons (charge bunches) exciting the X-mode.

<div> 关键词: 模拟星系团、IllustrisTNG、MGS算法、星系超密度、halo identification

总结:
本文介绍了基于IllustrisTNG模拟的新型模拟星系团目录，使用MGS算法识别星系超密度。与以往的友邻法集群识别不同，本文的集群识别考虑了星系亚暗物质而非不可观测的暗物质粒子，并且采用MGS算法，能够有效分离由大质量星系托管的星系超密度。MGS目录列出了303个M200 > 1014M⊙的halos，比FoF目录多约10％。MGS目录的独立性能够识别出更多独立的大质量星系团halos，这有助于更好地评估MGS星系团对星系演化的影响，并且能够有效识别出合并星系团。因此，MGS星系团目录是研究宇宙学模拟中星系团及与观测星系团样本比较的有用工具。 <div>
We present a new simulated galaxy cluster catalog based on the IllustrisTNG simulation. We use the Mulguisin (MGS) algorithm to identify galaxy overdensities. Our cluster identification differs from the previous friends-of-friends (FoF) cluster identification in two aspects: (1) we identify cluster halos based on the galaxy subhalos instead of unobservable dark matter particles, and (2) we use the MGS algorithm, which separates galaxy overdensities hosted by massive galaxies. Our approach provides a cluster catalog constructed in a way similar to the construction of observed cluster catalogs using spectroscopic surveys. The MGS cluster catalog lists 303 halos with M200 > 1014M⊙, including ∼10% more than the FoF catalog. The MGS catalog includes more systems because we separate some independent massive MGS cluster halos that are bundled into a single FoF halo. These independent MGS halos are apparently distinguishable in the galaxy spatial distribution and the phase-space diagram. Because we construct a refined cluster catalog that identifies local galaxy overdensities, we evaluate the effect of MGS clusters on the evolution of galaxies better than when using the FoF cluster catalog. The MGS halo identification also enables effective identifications of merging clusters by selecting systems with neighboring galaxy overdensities. We thus highlight the fact that the MGS cluster catalog is a useful tool for studying clusters in cosmological simulations and for comparing with observed cluster samples.

<br /><br />总结: 通过对3C391:NML分子云进行分子观测和化学模型研究，发现它受到了强烈的宇宙射线影响，需要比典型分子云更高的宇宙射线电离率才能解释观测结果。 <div>
Cosmic rays (CRs) have strong influences on the chemistry of dense molecular clouds (MCs). To study the detailed chemistry induced by CRs, we conducted a Yebes W-band line survey towards an unshocked MC (which we named 3C391:NML) associated with supernova remnant 3C 391. We detected emission lines of 18 molecular species in total and estimated their column densities with local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE analysis. Using the abundance ratio N(HCO+)/N(CO) and an upper limit of N(DCO+)/N(HCO+), we estimated that the CR ionization rate of 3C391:NML is ζ ≳ 2.7 × 10−14 s−1 with an analytic method. However, we caution against adopting this value because chemical equilibrium, which is a prerequisite of using the equations, is not necessarily reached in 3C391:NML. We observed lower N(HCO+)/N(HOC+), higher N(HCS+)/N(CS), and higher X(l-C3H+) by an order of magnitude in 3C391:NML than the typical values in quiescent dense MCs. We found that an enhanced CR ionization rate (of order ∼10−15 or ∼10−14 s−1) is needed to reproduce the observation with a chemical model. This is higher than the values found in typical MCs by 2–3 orders of magnitude.

<div> gravitational waves, supermassive binary black holes, pulsar timing array, detection probability, GWB origin

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章探讨了超大质量双黑洞在脉冲星定时阵列实验中的引力波信号检测，以及对引力波背景和个体源的来源进行了研究。研究发现，如果检测到的引力波信号完全源自双黑洞，那么质量与宿主星系的红移演化需呈现显著正向趋势。同时，中国脉冲星定时阵列观测数据具有较高的个体双黑洞检测概率，并且即使双黑洞对引力波背景信号的贡献仅为10％，也有望在约10年的观测期内获得积极的检测结果。在未来数年内未能检测到个体双黑洞信号的情况下，结合已检测的引力波背景信号，可以对双黑洞对引力波背景信号的上限提出严格限制，并有助于确定/否定其宇宙起源。 <div>
The gravitational waves (GWs) from supermassive binary black holes (BBHs) have long been sought by pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments, in the forms of both a stochastic GW background (GWB) and individual sources. Evidence for a GWB was reported recently by several PTAs with origins to be determined. Here we use a BBH population synthesis model to investigate the detection probability of individual BBHs by the Chinese PTA (CPTA) and the constraint on the GWB origin that may be obtained by PTA observations of both GWB and individual BBHs. If the detected GWB signal is entirely due to BBHs, a significantly positive redshift evolution (∝ (1 + z)2.07) of the mass scaling relation between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies is required. In this case, we find that the detection probability of individual BBHs is ∼85% or 64% if using a period of 3.4 yr of CPTA observation data, with an expectation of ∼1.9 or 1.0 BBHs detectable with a signal-to-noise ratio ≥3 or 5, and it is expected to increase to >95% if the observation period is extended to 5 yr or longer. Even if the contribution from BBHs to the GWB power signal is as small as ∼10%, a positive detection of individual BBHs can still be expected within an observation period of ∼10 yr. A nondetection of individual BBHs within several years from now jointly with the detected GWB signal can put a strong constraint on the upper limit of the BBH contribution to the GWB signal and help identify/falsify a cosmological origin.

Nitrogen lines are widely observed in astrophysical spectra and provide important diagnostics for plasma properties. In this work, we present extended calculations for accurate energy levels, electric dipole radiative transition parameters, and lifetimes for the lowest 102 states of the 2s22p2, 2s2p3, 2s2p23s, 2s22p{n1l, n2d, 4f}(n1 = 3–5, l = s, p, n2 = 3, 4), and 2p4 configurations of N ii within the framework of the fully relativistic multiconfiguration Dirac–Hartree–Fock and relativistic configuration interaction methods. These data are useful for modeling astrophysical spectra, for example, for nitrogen abundance determinations in early B-type stars, and for studying the compositions and plasma properties of H ii regions and planetary nebulae. Our computed transition parameters are compared with available experimental and theoretical data. The accuracy of the calculations is also assessed via a statistical analysis of the differences between the transition rates in the Babushkin and Coulomb gauges and by consideration of cancellation factors. In this way, 201 of the 1656 transitions computed in this work are estimated to be from accurate to better than 3%, corresponding to an accuracy class of A.

The hydrogen recombination lines H30α, H40α, H42α, H50β, and H57γ and the underlying bremsstrahlung continuum emission were detected with ALMA in the bipolar nebula Mz3. The source was not spatially resolved, but the velocity profile of the H30α line shows clear indication of maser amplification, confirming previous reports of laser amplification in the far-infrared H recombination lines observed with Herschel Space Observatory. Comparison between the flux densities of the H50β, H40α, and H42α lines show overcooling, or darkness amplification by stimulated absorption (dasar effect) at the LSR velocity of about −25 km s−1, which constrains the density of the absorbing region to about 103 cm−3. The H30α line, on the other hand, presents maser lines at LSR velocities of −69 and −98 km s−1, which indicates ionized gas with densities close to 107 cm−3. Although the source of emission was not resolved, it was possible to find the central position of the images for each velocity interval, which resulted in a well defined position–velocity distribution.

总结: 
这项研究调查了NGC 1399球状星团中质量在102M⊙至105M⊙范围内的中间质量黑洞（IMBHs）的可检测性。研究使用了理论的邦迪吸积模型和黑洞吸积的经验基本平面（FP）来估计IMBH的质量，发现IMBH在射电频率300.00 MHz下是可探测的。通过对77个球状星团候选对象进行3小时观测，利用方阵平方公里阵列（Square Kilometre Array），成功识别出了表明IMBH吸积的射电探测基准。研究发现，NGC 1399中的球状星团内的IMBH是可检测到的，并且邦迪吸积模型提供IMBH质量估计为2.93 × 103.0±0.39M⊙至7.43 × 104.0±0.39M⊙，而经验FP关系则指出IMBH质量估计为3.41 × 105.0±0.96M⊙。这些发现强调了球状星团中IMBH的存在和可检测性，为IMBH作为超大质量黑洞的先导体的角色以及黑洞在天体物理环境中形成和演化的认识提供了新的见解。 <br /><br /> <div>
This study investigates the detectability of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) within the mass range 102M⊙ ≤ MBH ≤ 105M⊙ in the globular star clusters of NGC 1399 at a frequency of 300.00 MHz. Employing the theoretical Bondi accretion model and the empirical fundamental plane (FP) of black hole accretion, we estimate IMBH masses based on bolometric luminosity and X-ray/radio luminosities, respectively. By simulating a 3 hr observation of 77 globular cluster (GC) candidates using the Square Kilometre Array, we identify radio detection benchmarks indicative of accretion onto IMBHs. Our results show that IMBHs inside the globular star clusters located in NGC 1399 are indeed detectable, with the Bondi accretion model providing IMBH mass estimates ranging from 2.93 × 103.0±0.39M⊙ to 7.43 × 104.0±0.39M⊙ and the empirical FP relation suggesting IMBH mass estimation with 3.41 × 105.0±0.96M⊙. These findings highlight the presence and detectability of IMBHs in GCs, offering insights into their role as precursors to supermassive black holes and enriching our understanding of black hole formation and evolution in astrophysical environments.

<title>Anisotropic Heating and Cooling within Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection Sheath Plasma</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study presents the first comprehensive investigation of the relationship between heating and cooling, temperature anisotropy, turbulence level, and collisional age within interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) sheaths, which are highly compressed, heated, and turbulent. Using Wind spacecraft data, we analyze 333 ICME sheaths observed at 1 au from 1995 to 2015. The proton temperature within the ICME sheaths has a log-normal probability distribution. Irrespective of instability growth rates, plasma unstable to proton-cyclotron (PC) and firehose instabilities appear to be statistically hotter, at least by a factor of 5 to 10, compared to stable plasma. We also observe relatively enhanced magnetic fluctuations and low collisional age, especially in regimes unstable to PC and firehose instabilities at low proton betas βp ≤ 2. In the case of high beta βp ≥ 2, we observe high magnetic fluctuations close to the instabilities and less collisional age to the plasma unstable to firehose instability rather than near the mirror mode and PC threshold. Our findings suggest that heating processes dominate over cooling processes in producing proton temperature anisotropy in the ICME sheath region. Moreover, collisional age and magnetic fluctuations are critical in maintaining anisotropic and isotropic conditions.

A small fraction of fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been observed with multiple bursts, whereas most Galactic sources emitting radio pulses are known to repeat. Here we present the results of follow-up observations of two FRBs and four rotating radio transients (RRATs). Among these, only one RRAT has been observed with repeating pulses, with an estimated period of around 1.297047 s. For comparison, we reanalysed the Parkes archival follow-up observations in CSIRO’s data archive for all apparently one-off sources discovered by the Parkes telescopes, including 13 RRATs and 29 FRBs. In total, 3 RRATs are suggested to be repeaters, but no repeating signals were detected from the other sources. Reporting details of the nondetection observations for the apparently one-off sources would help investigate their origins, and catastrophic scenarios are worth proposing for both extragalactic and Galactic sources.

总结：<br /><br />该研究使用相对论计算模拟了两个质量相等、不自旋的黑洞从20M初始距离几乎合并。研究结果表明，黑洞的吸积速率先下降，然后趋于稳定，在快速螺旋中仅下降了大约3倍。估计的全波光度曲线遵循相同的特征，这表明一些螺旋合并的超大质量双黑洞在预期的周围盘脱耦后可能具有显着的亮度。小盘是非标准的，雷诺应力主导，而不是麦克斯韦应力，并且在两种状态之间振荡。在循环的某个部分，“晃动”流会在小盘之间传输质量，以最大小盘全波光度的速率携带动能。我们还发现，周期性吸积驱动时间变化的小盘倾斜。这些复杂的动态都导致了螺旋合并超大质量双黑洞光度曲线的独特周期性行为。黑洞的极轴磁通大致上保持在ϕ∼2-3的无量纲水平上，但在合并前突然增加一倍；对于有显著自旋的黑洞来说，这样的磁通预测了由二元动力学驱动的具有变化性的强喷流，这是另一个潜在独特的电磁特征。这项模拟是第一个使用多块基础设施PatchworkMHD的，降低了计算成本，约为传统单网格方法的3％。 <div>
While supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs) inspiral toward merger they may also accrete matter from a surrounding disk. To study the dynamics of this system requires simultaneously describing the evolving spacetime and the magnetized plasma. We present the first relativistic calculation simulating two equal-mass, nonspinning black holes as they inspiral from a 20 M (G = c = 1) initial separation almost to merger. Our results imply important observational consequences: for instance, the accretion rate onto the black holes first decreases and then plateaus, dropping by only a factor of ∼3 despite the rapid inspiral. An estimated bolometric light curve follows the same profile, suggesting some merging SMBBHs may be significantly luminous past the predicted circumbinary disk decoupling. The minidisks are nonstandard: Reynolds, not Maxwell, stresses dominate, and they oscillate between two states. In one part of the cycle, “sloshing” streams transfer mass between minidisks, carrying kinetic energy at a rate sometimes as high as the peak minidisk bolometric luminosity. We also discover that episodic accretion drives time-varying minidisk tilts. These complex dynamics all contribute to unique cyclical behavior in the light curves of late-time inspiraling SMBBHs. The poloidal magnetic flux on the black holes is roughly constant at a dimensionless level ϕ ∼ 2–3, but doubles just before merger; for significant black hole spin, this flux predicts powerful jets with variability driven by binary dynamics, another potentially unique electromagnetic signature. This simulation is the first to employ our multipatch infrastructure PatchworkMHD, decreasing the computational expense to ∼3% of conventional single-grid methods’ cost.

总结:<br /><br />王等人的最新研究调查了大于10MeV的太阳质子事件，通过STEREO-A、STEREO-B和SOHO航天器进行观测。研究识别了每次事件中与源区最佳磁场连接的航天器，并通过拟合分析了航天器观测到的高能质子强度。拟合过程产生了两个参数b和c，用于每次事件的四个能量通道。统计分析揭示了b和c之间的幂律相关性。研究中还对在星际空间中的粒子扩散系数进行了深入探讨，模拟表明径向平均自由程与径向距离呈幂律关系。因此，观测表明了径向平均自由程随着径向距离呈幂律变化。这个模型在未来的研究中有望用于确定高能质子的平均自由程。 <div>
A recent study by Wang et al. investigated gradual solar proton events with energies >10 MeV, as observed by STEREO-A, STEREO-B, and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory spacecraft. For each event, the spacecraft with the best magnetic connection to the source region among the three spacecraft was identified, and energetic proton intensities observed by the spacecraft were analyzed through fitting. The fitting process produced two parameters, b and c, for four energy channels (13–16 MeV, 20–25 MeV, 32–40 MeV, and 40–64 MeV) in each event. Parameters b and c govern the rise and decay of particle intensities, respectively. Statistical analysis revealed a power-law correlation between b and c, expressed as c ∼ b−γ. In this study, in order to explain the relation between the two parameters, we investigate the model of particle diffusion coefficients in the interplanetary space. In our simulations, the radial mean free path is modeled as a power function of radial distance, successfully reproducing the b–c relation. Consequently, the observations demonstrate that the radial mean free path varies with radial distance in a power law. In future research, the model of diffusion coefficients holds promise in determining the mean free path of energetic protons.

总结:<br />
本研究使用多时段最大似然估计（MLE）方法分析了附近超新星遗迹（SNR）的十年变化。通过整合运动特征和点扩散函数效应到MLE框架中，提高了捕捉SNR动态的准确性。利用卡西奥佩拉A作为代表性示例，使用Chandra X射线天文台在2000年、2009年和2019年获取的数据。该方法定性和定量地证明了对所有区域的冲击波和微弱特征等各种运动提供了准确估计。为了研究不对称结构，MLE方法扩展到结合多个计算域，并使用k-means算法对运动属性进行分类。这种方法允许将不同的物理状态映射到图像上，并通过与James Webb太空望远镜的红外观测进行比较，推测出一个分类的组分与星周物质相互作用。因此，这项技术将有助于量化SNR的动态并发现它们独特的演变。 <div>
Decadal changes in a nearby supernova remnant (SNR) were analyzed using a multiepoch maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach. To achieve greater accuracy in capturing the dynamics of SNRs, kinematic features and point-spread function effects were integrated into the MLE framework. Using Cassiopeia A as a representative example, data obtained by the Chandra X-ray Observatory in 2000, 2009, and 2019 were utilized. The proposed multiepoch MLE was qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrated to provide accurate estimates of various motions, including shock waves and faint features, across all regions. To investigate asymmetric structures, such as singular components that deviate from the direction of expansion, the MLE method was extended to combine multiple computational domains and classify kinematic properties using the k-means algorithm. This approach allowed for the mapping of different physical states onto the image, and one classified component was suggested to interact with circumstellar material by comparison with infrared observations from the James Webb Space Telescope. Thus, this technique will help quantify the dynamics of SNRs and discover their unique evolution.

<div> X-ray survey, Stripe 82, spectroscopic redshifts, Type 1 AGN, black hole masses<br />总结:<br />本研究发布了Stripe 82 X射线调查的第三个目录，结合了先前发表的X射线源特性、多波长对应物和光度红移，提供了343个新的光谱红移，并为1297个1型活动星系核（AGN）提供了黑洞质量。调查的光谱完整性为56％，在光学星等极限r < 22的Stripe 82X调查连续部分上升至90％。AGN中有23％被认为是被遮挡的，与其他调查不同，1型和X-ray遮挡的AGN只有18％的重叠。我们发现，具有最高X射线光度的AGN正在以最高爱丁顿比例进行吸积，这与大部分黑洞质量吸积发生在AGN明亮阶段的图像一致。我们还发现黑洞质量估计存在较大散布，应使用统一的公式计算黑洞质量以最小化偏见。 <div>
We present the third catalog release of the wide-area (31.3 deg2) Stripe 82 X-ray survey. This catalog combines previously published X-ray source properties with multiwavelength counterparts and photometric redshifts, presents 343 new spectroscopic redshifts, and provides black hole masses for 1297 Type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGN). With spectroscopic redshifts for 3457 out of 6181 Stripe 82X sources, the survey has a spectroscopic completeness of 56%. This completeness rises to 90% when considering the contiguous portions of the Stripe 82X survey with homogeneous X-ray coverage at an optical magnitude limit of r < 22. Within that portion of the survey, 23% of AGN can be considered obscured by being either a Type 2 AGN, reddened (R − K > 4, Vega), or X-ray obscured with a column density of NH > 1022 cm−2. Unlike other surveys, there is only an 18% overlap between Type 2 and X-ray obscured AGN. We calculated black hole masses for Type 1 AGN that have Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra using virial mass estimators calibrated on the Hβ, Mg ii, Hα, and C iv emission lines. We find wide scatter in these black hole mass estimates, indicating that statistical analyses should use black hole masses calculated from the same formula to minimize bias. We find that the AGN with the highest X-ray luminosities are accreting at the highest Eddington ratios, consistent with the picture that most black hole mass accretion happens in the phase when the AGN is luminous (L2−10keV > 1045 erg s−1).

总结: 
声速上限是核物质的平方声速的最大值，本研究通过多信使观测和非参数方法重构的方程状态证实了这一上限。观测数据表明，声速上限与中子星质心附近物质的性质一致，这与pQCD驱动的因果约束相符。另外，结果显示声速上限与核物质密度之间存在明显相关性，而当密度达到临界值时，这种相关性被违反。最新的联合约束结果显示中子星的半径和质量的范围。这些研究结果通过两个独立约束的一致性，进一步证实了它们的有效性。 <br /><br /> <div>
Very recently, it has been shown that there is an upper bound on the squared sound speed of nuclear matter from the transport, which reads . In this work, we demonstrate that this upper bound is corroborated by the reconstructed equation of state (EOS; modeled with a nonparametric method) for ultradense matter. The reconstruction integrates multimessenger observation for neutron stars, in particular, the latest radius measurements for PSR J0437–4715 ( km), PSR J0030+0451 ( km, in the ST+PDT model), and PSR J0740+6620 ( km) by NICER have been adopted. The result shows in all cases, the upper limit for EOS will naturally yield the properties of matter near the center of the massive neutron star consistent with the causality-driven constraint from pQCD, where, in practice, the density in implementing the pQCD likelihood (nL) is applied at (where is the nuclear saturation density). We also note that there is a strong correlation for the maximum cs2 with nL, and is somehow violated when nL = nc,TOV. The result indicates that a higher nL, even considering the uncertainties from statistics, is more natural. Moreover, the remarkable agreement between the outcomes derived from these two distinct and independent constraints (i.e., the transport calculation and pQCD boundary) lends strong support to their validity. In addition, the latest joint constraint for R1.4, R2.0, R1.4 − R2.0, and MTOV are km, km, km, and (at 90% credible level), respectively.

<div> 关键词: 星体形成率，NGC 1068，分子气体盘，H ii 区域，数值模拟

总结: 
本研究针对近邻塞费尔特星系NGC 1068，利用新的高灵敏度Atacama大型毫米/亚毫米阵列100 GHz连续数据，结合哈勃空间望远镜Paα线数据，提出了NGC 1068分子气体盘的星体形成率（SFR）校准。校准过程中考虑了尘埃消光、H ii 区域的电子温度、AGN污染和扩散电离气体（DIG）的空间变化。经过修正后，NGC 1068盘的总SFR估计为3.2 ± 0.5 M⊙ yr−1。研究还发现南部条状结束和共转半径周围存在高SFR，与先前的SFR测量结果相一致。此外，研究指出基于8μm尘埃发射的总SFR与实际SFR存在差异，这是由于不同追踪器追踪到不同阶段演化的年轻恒星和各自的时间尺度。这项研究提供了一个案例，来解决传统SFR测量中的各种不确定性及其可能导致重大SFR误差的潜在问题。 <div>
The star formation rate (SFR) is a fundamental parameter for describing galaxies and inferring their evolutionary course. H ii regions yield the best measure of instantaneous SFR in galaxies, although the derived SFR can have large uncertainties depending on tracers and assumptions. We present an SFR calibration for the entire molecular gas disk of the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, based on our new high-sensitivity Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array 100 GHz continuum data at 55 pc (= 0.″8) resolution in combination with the Hubble Space Telescope Paα line data. In this calibration, we account for the spatial variations of dust extinction, electron temperature of H ii regions, AGN contamination, and diffuse ionized gas (DIG) based on publicly available multiwavelength data. Especially, given the extended nature and the possible nonnegligible contribution to the total SFR, a careful consideration of DIG is essential. With a cross-calibration between two corrected ionized gas tracers (free–free continuum and Paα), the total SFR of the NGC 1068 disk is estimated to be 3.2 ± 0.5 M⊙ yr−1, one-third of the SFR without accounting for DIG (9.1 ± 1.4 M⊙ yr−1). We confirmed a high SFR around the southern bar end and the corotation radius, which is consistent with the previous SFR measurements. In addition, our total SFR exceeds the total SFR based on 8 μm dust emission by a factor of 1.5. We attribute this discrepancy to the differences in the young stars at different stages of evolution traced by each tracer and their respective timescales. This study provides an example to address the various uncertainties in conventional SFR measurements and their potential to lead to significant SFR miscalculations.

<div> TDEs, radio follow-up, ASKAP, late-time emission, optical discovery
Summary:
Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are increasingly being detected at radio wavelengths, challenging existing models for radio emission. A study using data from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) detected late-time emission in five TDEs, including the independent discovery of radio emission from TDE AT 2019ahk. The study finds that at least a portion of optically discovered TDEs has detectable radio emission, and projects that the ongoing ASKAP Variable and Slow Transients survey can detect approximately 20 TDEs in its operational span. This suggests that late-time radio activity is common to a broad class of TDEs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
Late-time (∼a year) radio follow-up of optically discovered tidal disruption events (TDEs) is increasingly resulting in detections at radio wavelengths, and there is growing evidence for this late-time radio activity to be common to the broad class of subrelativistic TDEs. Detailed studies of some of these TDEs at radio wavelengths are also challenging the existing models for radio emission. Using all-sky multiepoch data from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), taken as a part of the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS), we searched for radio counterparts to a sample of optically discovered TDEs. We detected late-time emission at RACS frequencies (742–1032 MHz) in five TDEs, reporting the independent discovery of radio emission from TDE AT 2019ahk and extending the time baseline out to almost 3000 days for some events. Overall, we find that at least of the population of optically discovered TDEs has detectable radio emission in the RACS survey, while also noting that the true fraction can be higher given the limited cadence (two epochs separated by ∼3 yr) of the survey. Finally, we project that the ongoing higher-cadence (∼2 months) ASKAP Variable and Slow Transients survey can detect ∼20 TDEs in its operational span (4 yr), given the current rate from optical surveys.

星际物质的形成是一个高度动态的过程，连接了从星系尺度的千秒巨泡到百帕尔赛克尺度的巨型分子云和星团的丝状层次结构，并受到超新星的反馈影响。通过多尺度的MHD模拟，可以追踪从星系尺度到亚秒尺度的结构形成过程。模拟表明，气体的吸积与压缩最终驱动了丝状结构形成巨型分子云和星团。在安静的区域，星系剪切可以产生扁平的旋转盘状结构内的丝状巨型分子云。模拟结果还展示了与这些盘状结构形成相关的螺旋磁场的形成。 <br /><br /> <div>
There is now abundant observational evidence that star formation is a highly dynamical process that connects filament hierarchies and supernova feedback from galaxy-scale kiloparsec filaments and superbubbles to giant molecular clouds (GMCs) on 100 pc scales and star clusters (1 pc). Here we present galactic multiscale MHD simulations that track the formation of structure from galactic down to subparsec scales in a magnetized, Milky Way–like galaxy undergoing supernova-driven feedback processes. We do this by adopting a novel zoom-in technique that follows the evolution of typical 3 kpc subregions without cutting out the surrounding galactic environment, allowing us to reach 0.28 pc resolution in the individual zoom-in regions. We find a wide range of morphologies and hierarchical structures, including superbubbles, turbulence, and kiloparsec atomic gas filaments hosting multiple GMC condensations that are often associated with superbubble compression, down to smaller-scale filamentary GMCs and star cluster regions within them. Gas accretion and compression ultimately drive filaments over a critical, scale-dependent line mass leading to gravitational instabilities that produce GMCs and clusters. In quieter regions, galactic shear can produce filamentary GMCs within flattened, rotating disklike structures on 100 pc scales. Strikingly, our simulations demonstrate the formation of helical magnetic fields associated with the formation of these disklike structures.

总结: 
这项研究利用James Clerk Maxwell Telescope SCUBA-2 850 μm连续波数据对G35分子复合体中的细丝和宿主团进行了系统研究。研究发现复合体内有五个云，其中包含91条细丝，其中一些形成了10个枢纽-细丝系统，每个系统至少有三条枢纽组成的细丝。此外，研究编制了一个包含350个密集团的目录，其中183个与细丝相关。   进一步调查了细丝和团的物理特性，如质量、密度和大小，以及它们与恒星形成的关系。研究发现，细丝的全局质量-长度趋势与湍流起源一致，而HFSs中线质量高（ml > 230 M⊙ pc−1）的枢纽组成细丝偏离了这一关系，可能是由于大质量恒星形成的反馈作用。同时发现，在细丝和HFSs的枢纽中，最大质量和最密集的团（R > 0.2 pc，M > 35 M⊙，Σ > 0.05 g cm−2）出现频率更高，突出了HFSs对于高质量恒星形成的优先地点。研究还发现，在云的不同进化环境中团的质量表面密度变化不大，这可能反映了质量吸积和恒星反馈之间的平衡。 <div>
Filaments are believed to play a key role in high-mass star formation. We present a systematic study of the filaments and their hosting clumps in the G35 molecular complex using James Clerk Maxwell Telescope SCUBA-2 850 μm continuum data. We identified five clouds in the complex and 91 filaments within them, some of which form 10 hub–filament systems (HFSs), each with at least three hub-composing filaments. We also compiled a catalog of 350 dense clumps, 183 of which are associated with the filaments. We investigated the physical properties of the filaments and clumps, such as mass, density, and size, and their relation to star formation. We find that the global mass–length trend of the filaments is consistent with a turbulent origin, while the hub-composing filaments of high line masses (ml > 230 M⊙ pc−1) in HFSs deviate from this relation, possibly due to feedback from massive star formation. We also find that the most massive and densest clumps (R > 0.2 pc, M > 35 M⊙, Σ > 0.05 g cm−2) are located in the filaments and in the hubs of HFSs, with the latter bearing a higher probability of the occurrence of high-mass star-forming signatures, highlighting the preferential sites of HFSs for high-mass star formation. We do not find significant variation in the clump mass surface density across different evolutionary environments of the clouds, which may reflect the balance between mass accretion and stellar feedback.

这项研究分析了一个稀有群体，即具有显著H i气体的强凸显型早型星系（sBDEs）的特性，使用了FAST全天H i巡天（FASHI）和阿雷西博遗产快速ALFA（ALFALFA）巡天的数据库。通过从斯隆数字化天空巡天中选择sBDEs，并与FASHI-ALFALFA组合的H i样本进行交叉匹配，得到了104个H i丰富的sBDEs。这些sBDEs倾向于具有极高的H i储库，这在以前的研究中很少见，比如ATLAS3D。选择的sBDEs中总共70%被分类为平静的星系，尽管它们具有大量的H i储库。我们从四个主要方面研究了这些sBDEs的特性：恒星群，气相金属丰度，堆积的H i光谱和环境。绝大多数H i丰富的sBDEs似乎显示出较低的气相金属丰度，并且位于明显较低密度的环境中，这表明它们的H i气体具有外部起源。我们发现，有星形成的sBDEs表现出统计上更高的星形成效率，稍微较老的恒星群，相比于正常的有星形成的星系，这表明在数十亿年的时间尺度上有最近的星形成。与对照有星形成的星系相比，它们也显示出更窄和更集中的H i轮廓，这可能解释了它们更高的星形成效率。

<br /><br />总结:
1. sBDEs具有极高的H i储库
2. 70%的sBDEs被分类为平静的星系
3. H i丰富的sBDEs表现出较低的气相金属丰度

We analyze the properties of a rare population, the strongly bulge-dominated early-type galaxies (sBDEs) with significant H i gas, using the databases from the FAST All Sky H i survey (FASHI) and the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey. We select the sBDEs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and crossmatch with the FASHI-ALFALFA combined H i sample, resulting in 104 H i-rich sBDEs. These sBDEs tend to have extremely high H i reservoirs, which is rare in previous studies such as ATLAS3D. A total of 70% of the selected sBDEs are classified as quiescent galaxies, even though they have a large H i reservoir. We study the properties of these sBDEs from four main aspects: stellar population, gas-phase metallicity, stacked H i spectra, and environment. The majority of H i-rich sBDEs appear to show lower gas-phase metallicity and are located in significantly lower-density environments, suggesting an external origin for their H i gas. We find that star-forming sBDEs exhibit statistically higher star formation efficiency and slightly older stellar populations compared to normal star-forming galaxies, suggesting a recent star formation on the Gyr timescale. They also show narrower and more concentrated H i profiles compared to control star-forming galaxies, which may explain their higher star formation efficiency.

The gradient technique is a promising tool with theoretical foundations based on the fundamental properties of MHD turbulence and turbulent reconnection. Its various incarnations use spectroscopic, synchrotron, and intensity data to trace the magnetic field and measure the media magnetization in terms of Alfvén Mach number. We provide an analytical theory of gradient measurements and quantify the effects of averaging gradients along the line of sight and over the plane of the sky. We derive analytical expressions that relate the properties of gradient distribution with the Alfvén Mach number MA. We show that these measurements can be combined with measures of sonic Mach number or line broadening to obtain the magnetic field strength. The corresponding technique has advantages to the Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi way of obtaining the magnetic field strength.

<div> Perseus Cluster, cold fronts, simulations, magnetohydrodynamics code, subcluster<br />
总结:<br />
文章介绍了Perseus Cluster中冷前沿的形成模拟研究。研究发现，低质量的亚团不能产生能够传播到如此大半径的冷前沿，而小的冲击参数会引起太多湍流，导致冷前沿在到达较大距离前被破坏。只有进行一次核心通过的亚团能产生一个稳定的冷前沿，并在后来的时间里扩展到较大半径，但是在核区域没有在后来的时间形成其他前沿。研究发现，质量比为R∼1:5且初始冲击参数为θ∼20°–25°的亚团产生了大的冷前沿，并在后来的时间在核心区域产生了第二组冷前沿。这些模拟表明，“古老”的冷前沿的年龄约为6–8.5亿年。对于观测结果提供了最接近匹配的模拟来说，亚团已经完全并入主团。 <div>
The intracluster medium of the Perseus Cluster exhibits spiral-shaped X-ray surface brightness discontinuities known as “cold fronts,” which simulations indicate are caused by the sloshing motion of the gas after the passage of a subcluster. Recent observations of Perseus have shown that these fronts extend to large radii. In this work, we present simulations of the formation of sloshing cold fronts in Perseus using the AREPO magnetohydrodynamics code, to produce a plausible scenario for the formation of the large front at a radius of 700 kpc. Our simulations explore a range of subcluster masses and impact parameters. We find that low-mass subclusters cannot generate a cold front that can propagate to such a large radius, and that small impact parameters create too much turbulence, which leads to the disruption of the cold front before it reaches such a large distance. Subclusters that make only one core passage produce a stable initial front that expands to large radii, but without a second core passage of the subcluster, other fronts are not created at a later time in the core region. We find a small range of simulations with subclusters with mass ratios of R ∼ 1:5 and an initial impact parameter of θ ∼ 20°–25° that not only produce the large cold front but a second set in the core region at later times. These simulations indicate that the “ancient” cold front is ∼6–8.5 Gyr old. For the simulations providing the closest match with observations, the subcluster has completely merged into the main cluster.

The origin of fast flux variability in blazars is a long-standing problem, with many theoretical models proposed to explain it. In this study, we focus on BL Lacertae to model its spectral energy distribution (SED) and broadband light curves using a diffusive shock acceleration process involving multiple mildly relativistic shocks, coupled with a time-dependent radiation transfer code. BL Lacertae was the target of a comprehensive multiwavelength monitoring campaign in early 2021 July. We present a detailed investigation of the source’s broadband spectral and light-curve features using simultaneous observations at optical–UV frequencies with the Swift Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope, in X-rays with the Swift X-Ray Telescope and AstroSat-SXT/LAXPC, and in gamma rays with Fermi-LAT, covering the period from 2021 July to August (MJD 59400–59450). A fractional variability analysis shows that the source is most variable in gamma rays, followed by X-rays, UV, and optical. This allowed us to determine the fastest variability time in gamma rays to be on the order of a few hours. The AstroSat-SXT and LAXPC light curves indicate X-ray variability on the order of a few kiloseconds. Modeling simultaneously the SEDs of low- and high-flux states of the source and the multiband light curves provided insights into the particle acceleration mechanisms at play. This is the first instance of a physical model that accurately captures the multiband temporal variability of BL Lacertae, including the hour-scale fluctuations observed during the flare.

<div> 关键词: 三维磁场、CN (N = 1–0) 发射线、尘埃连续辐射、磁场强度、高质量恒星形成区
总结:
本文对六个高质量恒星形成区使用了Taeduk射电天文台14米望远镜观测的CN (N = 1–0)数据和来自Herschel存档的尘埃连续数据，以测试CN线和尘埃连续辐射是否可以追踪相似的区域，并因此可用于推断三维磁场强度。通过比较所有目标的CN和H2柱密度，发现CN线发射倾向于强烈的连续区域。在所有目标中，峰值CN柱密度的位置与峰值H2柱密度的位置特别良好地相关，至少在一个或两个天文望远镜波束尺度内的H2柱密度为8.0×1022cm−2以上，这意味着CN线和尘埃连续辐射区域很可能在空间上重合。这使我们能够通过对其BLOS和BPOS进行矢量求和，可靠地测量出五个目标的三维磁场强度，有助于确定目标的磁致密性为超临界或跨临界。<br /><br /> <div>
Measuring the strength of a three-dimensional (3D) magnetic field vector is challenging as it is not easy to recognize whether its line-of-sight (LOS) and plane-of-sky (POS) components are obtained from the same region. CN (N = 1–0) emission has been used to get the LOS component of a magnetic field (BLOS) from its Zeeman splitting lines, while dust continuum emission has been used to get the POS component of a magnetic field (BPOS). We use the CN (N = 1–0) data observed with the Taeduk Radio Astronomy Observatory 14 m telescope and the dust continuum data from the Herschel archive toward six high-mass star-forming regions in order to test whether CN line and dust continuum emission can trace a similar region and thus can be used for inferring 3D magnetic field strength. Our comparison between CN and H2 column densities for all targets indicates that CN line emission tends to be strong toward bright continuum regions. The positions of peak CN column densities are particularly well correlated with those of peak H2 column densities, at least over the H2 column density of 8.0 × 1022 cm−2 within one or two telescope beam sizes in all targets, implying that CN-line- and dust-continuum-emitting regions are likely spatially coincident. This enabled us to make the reliable measurement of the 3D magnetic field strengths of five targets by taking a vector sum of their BLOS and BPOS, helping to decide the magnetical criticality of the targets as supercritical or transcritical.

<div> 关键词: 黑洞合并, 环形信号, 强场引力动力学, 时间域分析, 参数估计<br />
总结: <br />这篇论文介绍了一种新的时间域方法，用于分析黑洞合并后的环形信号。该方法通过重新配置似然函数并在所有模式的幅度和参考相位上进行解析最大化，实现了参数空间保持恒定，从而大大缩短了参数估计计算时间。传统的时间域方法在包括多个高次谐波模式时变得困难，而这种新方法则有效解决了这个问题。这个新的时间域方法对当前和未来的引力波探测器都具有广泛的研究适用性，并为黑洞频谱学的各种主题提供了灵活性。 <div>
After the final stage of the merger of two black holes (BHs), the ringdown signal takes an important role in providing information about the gravitational dynamics in strong field. We introduce a novel time-domain (TD) approach, predicated on the -statistic, for ringdown analysis. This method diverges from traditional TD techniques in that its parameter space remains constant irrespective of the number of modes incorporated. This feature is achieved by reconfiguring the likelihood and analytically maximizing over the extrinsic parameters that encompass the amplitudes and reference phases of all modes. Consequently, when performing the ringdown analysis under the assumption that the ringdown signal is detected by the Einstein Telescope, the parameter estimation computation time is shortened by at most 5 orders of magnitude compared to the traditional TD method. We further establish that traditional TD methods become difficult when including multiple overtone modes due to close oscillation frequencies and damping times across different overtone modes. Encouragingly, this issue is effectively addressed by our new TD technique. The accessibility of this new TD method extends to a broad spectrum of research and offers flexibility for various topics within BH spectroscopy applicable to both current and future gravitational wave detectors.

总结: 
近期观测研究表明，云团之间的碰撞可能与枢纽-丝状系统的形成有关。研究人员分析了云团碰撞的磁流体力学模拟数据，发现碰撞会在压缩层内形成丝状结构并驱动内部气流。这些气流在锥体的顶点汇聚，迅速聚集高密度气体，最终可能形成大质量恒星。PV图表明了气流朝着锥体顶点的流动，而磁场形态则朝着碰撞的方向弯曲。要注意的是，如果碰撞的云团大小差异较大，则在位置-速度和位置-位置空间中检测两个云团并确认它们的互补分布可能存在挑战。 <div>
Massive star-forming regions (MSFRs) are commonly associated with hub-filament systems (HFSs) and sites of cloud–cloud collision (CCC). Recent observational studies of some MSFRs suggest a possible connection between CCC and the formation of HFSs. To understand this connection, we analyzed the magnetohydrodynamic simulation data from Inoue et al. This simulation involves the collision of a spherical turbulent molecular cloud with a plane-parallel sea of dense molecular gas at a relative velocity of about 10 km s−1. Following the collision, the turbulent and nonuniform cloud undergoes shock compression, rapidly developing filamentary structures within the compressed layer. We found that CCC can lead to the formation of HFSs, which is the combined effect of turbulence, shock compression, magnetic field, and gravity. The collision between the cloud components shapes the filaments into a cone and drives inward flows among them. These inward flows merge at the vertex of the cone, rapidly accumulating high-density gas, which can lead to the formation of massive star(s). The cone acts as a mass-collecting machine, involving a nongravitational early process of filament formation, followed by gravitational gas attraction to finalize the HFS. The gas distribution in the position–velocity (PV) and position–position spaces highlights the challenges in detecting two cloud components and confirming their complementary distribution if the colliding clouds have a large size difference. However, such CCC events can be confirmed by the PV diagrams presenting gas flow toward the vertex of the cone, which hosts gravitationally collapsing high-density objects, and by the magnetic field morphology curved toward the direction of the collision.

<div> 巨型星系, 化学丰度数据, 银河系, 矮星系, 化学丰度模型

总结:<br /><br />这项研究使用了“两过程模型”来解释银河系和矮星系的恒星化学丰度数据，从而实现了对星系之间化学丰度历史差异的定量经验研究。研究发现，虽然矮星系的元素丰度模式存在着较大的变化，但是两过程框架能够准确地刻画它们之间许多元素的丰度模式，而这些多元素模式在矮星系卫星和银河系盘片之间存在着系统性差异。文章探讨了此差异的起源，强调了银河系盘片可能经历了大量原始气体的流入，稀释了形成星体的金属丰度，但没有改变元素丰度比。 <div>
The “two-process model” is a promising technique for interpreting stellar chemical abundance data from large-scale surveys (e.g., the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV/V and the Galactic Archeology with HERMES survey), enabling more quantitative empirical studies of differences in chemical enrichment history between galaxies without relying on detailed yield and evolution models. In this work, we fit two-process model parameters to (1) a luminous giant Milky Way (MW) sample and (2) stars comprising the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr). We then use these two sets of model parameters to predict the abundances of 14 elements of stars belonging to the MW and in five of its massive satellite galaxies, analyzing the residuals between the predicted and observed abundances. We find that the model fit to (1) results in large residuals (0.1–0.3 dex) for most metallicity-dependent elements in the metal-rich ([Mg/H] > −0.8) stars of the satellite galaxies. However, the model fit to (2) results in small or no residuals for all elements across all satellite galaxies. Therefore, despite the wide variation in [X/Mg]–[Mg/H] abundance patterns of the satellite galaxies, the two-process framework provides an accurate characterization of their abundance patterns across many elements, but these multielement patterns are systematically different between the dwarf galaxy satellites and the MW disks. We consider a variety of scenarios for the origin of this difference, highlighting the possibility that a large inflow of pristine gas to the MW disk diluted the metallicity of star-forming gas without changing abundance ratios.

The Press–Schechter (PS) and excursion set (ES) models of structure formation fail in reproducing the halo bias found in simulations, while the ES-peaks' formalism built in the peak model reproduces it only at high masses and does not address in a fully satisfactory manner peak nesting, and the mass and time of ellipsoidal collapse of triaxial peaks in the Gaussian-smoothed density field. Here, we apply the confluent system of peak trajectories formalism fixing all these issues from first principles and with no free parameters to infer the Lagrangian local peak bias parameters, which adopt very simple analytic expressions similar to those found in the PS and ES models. The predicted Eulerian linear halo bias recovers the results of simulations. More specifically, we show that the only small departure observed at intermediate and low masses can be due to the spurious halo splitting and grouping caused by the spherical overdensity halo-finding algorithm used in simulations.

Quasar feedback is a key ingredient in shaping galaxy evolution. A rare population of extremely red quasars (ERQs) at z = 2−3 are often associated with high-velocity [O iii]λ5008 outflows and may represent sites of strong feedback. In this paper, we present an X-ray study of 50 ERQs to investigate the link between the X-ray and outflow properties of these intriguing objects. Using hardness ratio analysis, we confirm that the ERQs are heavily obscured systems with gas column density reaching NH = 1023−24 cm−2. We identify 20 X-ray-nondetected ERQs at high mid-infrared (MIR) luminosities of νLν,6 μm ≳ 3 × 1046 erg s−1. By stacking the X-ray observations, we find that the nondetected ERQs are on average underluminous in X-rays by a factor of ∼10 for their MIR luminosities. We consider such X-ray weakness to be due to both heavy gas absorption and intrinsic factors. Moreover, we find that the X-ray-weak sources also display higher-velocity outflows. One option to explain this trend is that weaker X-rays facilitate more vigorous line-driven winds, which then accelerate the [O iii]-emitting gas to kiloparsec scales. Alternatively, super-Eddington accretion could also lead to intrinsic X-ray weakness and more powerful continuum-driven outflow.

How do galaxies of different luminosities contribute to the metal absorber populations of varying species and strength? We present our analysis of the predicted metal contributions from galaxies as observed in quasar absorption line spectra during the end of the epoch of reionization (10 ≥ z ≥ 5.5). This was done by implementing on-the-fly particle tracking into the latest Technicolor Dawn simulation and then linking C ii, C iv, Si ii, Si iv, O i, and Mg ii absorbers to host galaxies in postprocessing. We define the host galaxy luminosity distribution (HGLD) as the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity distribution of galaxies contributing ions to an absorber, weighted by the fractional contribution, and compute its dependence on ion and absorber strength. The HGLD shape is predicted to be indistinguishable from the field luminosity function, indicating that there is no relationship between the absorber strength or ion and the luminosity of the dominant contributing galaxy. Switching from galaxy luminosity to stellar mass, the predicted host galaxy mass distributions (HGMDs) indicate that more-massive galaxies contribute a higher fraction of metal ions to absorbers of each species, with the HGMDs of stronger absorbers extending out to higher masses. We conclude that the fraction of absorbing metal ions contributed by galaxies increases weakly with stellar mass, but the scatter in luminosity at fixed stellar mass obscures this relationship. For the same reason, we predict that observational analyses of the absorber–galaxy relationship will uncover stronger trends with stellar mass than with luminosity.

Measurements of the accelerations of stars enabled by time-series extreme-precision spectroscopic observations, pulsar timing, and eclipsing binary stars in the solar neighborhood offer insights into the mass distribution of the Milky Way that do not rely on traditional equilibrium modeling. Given the measured accelerations, we can determine a total mass density and infer the amount of dark matter (DM) by accounting for the mass in stars, gas, and dust. Leveraging FIRE-2 simulations of Milky Way–mass galaxies we compare vertical acceleration profiles between cold DM (CDM) and self-interacting DM (SIDM) with a constant cross section of 1 cm2 g−1 across three halos with diverse assembly histories. Notably, significant asymmetries in vertical acceleration profiles near the midplane at fixed radii are observed in both CDM and SIDM, particularly in halos recently affected by mergers with satellites of Sagittarius/SMC-like masses or greater. These asymmetries offer a unique window into exploring the merger history of a galaxy. We show that SIDM halos manifest a more oblate shape and consistently exhibit higher local stellar and DM densities and steeper vertical acceleration gradients, up to 10%–30% steeper near the solar neighborhood. However, similar magnitude changes can arise from azimuthal variations in the baryonic components at a fixed radius and external influences like mergers, making it difficult to distinguish between CDM and SIDM using acceleration measurements in a single galaxy.

太阳活动是由太阳大气中积累的磁能释放所引起的。为了了解其物理机制，必须研究日冕磁场的动力学。然而，由于缺乏直接测量，主导机制仍不清楚。基于磁流体力学（MHD）的数值模拟可以复制太阳日冕磁场的动态演化，提供了一个探索耀斑起源的有用工具。基于观测数据的MHD模拟可以探索不同的机制。通过使用光球磁场的时间序列观测数据作为模拟边界条件，我们对NOAA活动区11283中的几次大型耀斑进行了模拟。我们使用了零beta MHD控制的数据驱动模型，重点关注M5.3耀斑（2011年9月6日01:59 UT）前的自由磁能积累。我们再现了与耀斑相关的喷发，随着扭曲磁场或磁通绳（MFR）的形成，并受其足点处的光球运动的影响。我们发现，喷发首先是由挽稳定性的增长触发的。喷发的MFR通过与喷发方向上的邻近磁场线的磁重联导致了喷发。利用模拟结果和以MFR为中心的轴向-径向衰减指数，我们找到了喷发倾斜的自然解释，并可能预测太阳喷发事件的方向的方法。

Solar energetic events are caused by the release of magnetic energy accumulated in the solar atmosphere. To understand their initiating physical mechanisms, the dynamics of the coronal magnetic fields must be studied. Unfortunately, the dominant mechanisms are still unclear due to a lack of direct measurements. Numerical simulations based on magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) can reproduce the dynamical evolution of solar coronal magnetic field, providing a useful tool to explore flare initiation. Data-driven MHD simulations, in which the time-series observational data of the photospheric magnetic field is used as the simulation boundary condition, can explore different mechanisms. To investigate the accumulation of free magnetic energy through a solar eruption, we simulated the first of several large flares in NOAA active region 11283. We used a data-driven model that was governed by zero-beta MHD, focusing on the free magnetic energy accumulation prior to the M5.3 flare (2011 September 6 at 01:59 UT). We reproduced the flare-associated eruption following the formation of twisted magnetic fields, or a magnetic flux rope (MFR), formed by photospheric motions at its footpoints. We found that the eruption was first triggered by the growth of the torus instability. The erupting MFR caused magnetic reconnections with neighboring magnetic field lines located along the direction of the eruption. Using the simulation results and an axial-radial decay index centered on the MFR, we find a natural explanation for the inclination of the eruption and a possible approach to predict the direction of solar eruptive events.

Using linear perturbation theory, we investigate the density wake morphology, dynamical friction force, and secular orbital evolution for massive single perturbers as well as equal-mass binaries embedded in a homogeneous, static medium. In all cases, the rate of change in the semimajor axis is found to be negative (as expected), whereas the rate of change in eccentricity is negative for strictly subsonic trajectories and positive for strictly supersonic trajectories. Transonic orbits can experience both positive and negative torques during the course of an orbit, with some growing in eccentricity and others circularizing. We observe all initial orbits becoming highly supersonic and eccentric (over sufficiently long timescales) due to a relentless semimajor axis decay increasing the Mach number and subsequent eccentricity driving. We compare our findings to previous studies for rectilinear and circular motion while also making our data for the evolution of Keplerian orbits available.

<div> surface gravities, masses, radii, red giant stars, TESS photometric light curves

红巨星表面重力、质量和半径的测量方法可能存在系统性差异，这可能导致行星质量的过估计。研究发现，用天文测量方法和光学测量方法得出的红巨星的基本参数存在差异，其中星体半径的差异最大，可能存在系统性的过估计。此外，两颗恒星的质量和半径与现有的测量结果存在显著差异，提示了有待进一步研究的问题。提醒研究者，在推断行星性质时需要谨慎对待红巨星半径参数的不确定性。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
We present a study of asteroseismically derived surface gravities, masses, and radii of a sample of red giant stars both with and without confirmed planetary companions using TESS photometric light curves. These red giants were drawn from radial velocity surveys, and their reported properties in the literature rely on more traditional methods using spectroscopy and isochrone fitting. Our asteroseismically derived surface gravities achieved a precision of ∼0.01 dex; however, they were on average ∼0.1 dex smaller than the literature. The systematic larger gravities of the literature could plausibly present as a systematic overestimation of stellar masses, which would in turn lead to overestimated planetary masses of the companions. We find that the fractional discrepancies between our asteroseismically determined parameters and those previously found are typically larger for stellar radii (∼10% discrepancy) than for stellar masses (<5% discrepancy). However, no evidence of a systematic difference between methods was found for either fundamental parameter. Two stars, HD 100065 and HD 18742, showed significant disagreement with the literature in both mass and radii. We explore the impacts of updated stellar properties on inferred planetary properties and caution that red giant radii may be more poorly constrained than uncertainties suggest.

<div> 关键词: 快速射电暴、中子星、小行星带、轨道配置、轨道偏心率

中子星和小行星带之间的重复FRBs问题一直让人们费解。一种观点认为，重复的FRBs可能是由中子星与小行星带之间的相互作用产生的。本文中，我们研究了围绕大质量恒星存在小行星带的系统，并且中子星作为大质量恒星的伴星，通过引力相互作用与小行星带发生作用。我们假设了各种不同的轨道配置，并进行了直接N体模拟来研究小行星带的动力学演化。我们发现，中子星的轨道离心率越大，小行星带就会更快地被摧毁，大量小行星将被散射出系统。低倾角不仅抑制了碰撞，而且在早期阶段还抑制了小行星的抛射率。然而，高倾角系统可能会经历强烈的振荡，导致科萨伊-李多夫不稳定。在各种配置中，我们观察到了在轨道离心率为0.7且相互倾角为0°的情况下碰撞事件的明显周期性。我们发现，这种周期性至少可以在八个中子星轨道周期内持续存在，支持了这种机制是解释周期性重复FRB的可能性。我们的研究还表明，这种FRB源的活跃阶段应该是有限的，因为小行星带最终会被中子星摧毁。 <br /><br />总结: 本文研究了中子星和小行星带之间的相互作用，发现中子星的轨道参数对小行星带的演化有着重要的影响。我们观察到了在特定轨道配置下碰撞事件的周期性，这可能解释了重复FRB的现象。另外，我们也发现这种类型的FRB源的活跃期是有限的，因为小行星带最终会被摧毁。 <div>
Some fast radio bursts (FRBs) exhibit repetitive behaviors, and their origins remain enigmatic. It has been argued that repeating FRBs could be produced by the interaction between a neutron star and an asteroid belt. Here, we consider the systems in which an asteroid belt dwells around a massive star, while a neutron star, as a companion of the massive star, interacts with the belt through gravitational force. Various orbital configurations are assumed for the system. Direct N-body simulations are performed to investigate the dynamical evolution of the asteroids' belt. It is found that a larger orbital eccentricity of the neutron star will destroy the belt more quickly, with a large number of asteroids being scattered out of the system. A low inclination not only suppresses the collisions but also inhibits the ejection rate at early stages. However, highly inclined systems may undergo strong oscillations, resulting in the Kozai–Lidov instabilities. Among the various configurations, a clear periodicity is observed in the collision events for the case with an orbital eccentricity of 0.7 and mutual inclination of 0◦. It is found that such a periodicity can be sustained for at least eight neutron star orbital periods, supporting this mechanism as a possible explanation for periodically repeating FRBs. Our studies also suggest that the active stage of these kinds of FRB sources should be limited, since the asteroid belt would finally be destroyed by the neutron star after multiple passages.

总结：<br /><br />本研究通过三维广义相对论磁流体动力学模拟，探讨了与黑洞自旋轴不一致的磁层流动特性。结果显示，磁层呈现扭曲的稳定结构，外部磁层偏离黑洞轴线，接近黑洞附近存在直立激波。内部磁层与黑洞自旋轴部分一致，且随着半径的增加逐渐趋于一致。研究还提出了轨道拥挤的玩具模型，用于预测在中到快速自转的黑洞中激波的位置，这可能在确定实际不一致的天体系统中激波位置方面具有潜在的物理应用。 <div>
We carry out idealized three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of prograde, weakly magnetized, and geometrically thick accretion flows where the gas distribution is misaligned from the black hole (BH) spin axis. We evolve the disk for three BH spins: a = 0.5, 0.75, and 0.9375, and we contrast them with a standard aligned disk simulation with a = 0.9375. The tilted disks achieve a warped and twisted steady-state structure, with the outer disk misaligning further away from the BH and surpassing the initial 24° misalignment. However, closer to the BH, there is evidence of partial alignment, as the inclination angle decreases with radius in this regime. Standing shocks also emerged in proximity to the BH, roughly at ∼6 gravitational radii. We show that these shocks act to partially align the inner disk with the BH spin. The rate of alignment increases with increasing BH spin magnitude, but in all cases is insufficient to fully align the gas before it accretes. Additionally, we present a toy model of orbit crowding that can predict the location of the shocks in moderate-to-fast rotating BHs, illustrating a potential physical origin for the behavior seen in simulations—with possible applications in determining the positions of shocks in real misaligned astrophysical systems.

We develop a theoretical framework and use 2D hydrodynamical simulations to study the repulsive effect between two close orbiters embedded in an accretion disk. We consider orbiters on fixed Keplerian orbits with masses low enough to open shallow gaps. The simulations indicate that the repulsion is larger for more massive orbiters and decreases with the orbital separation and the disk’s viscosity. We use two different assumptions to derive theoretical scaling relations for the repulsion. A first scenario assumes that each orbiter absorbs the angular momentum deposited in its horseshoe region by the companion’s wake. A second scenario assumes that the corotation torques of the orbiters are modified because the companion changes the underlying radial gradient of the disk surface density. We find a substantial difference between the predictions of these two scenarios. The first one fails to reproduce the scaling of the repulsion with the disk viscosity and generally overestimates the strength of the repulsion. The second scenario, however, gives results that are broadly consistent with those obtained in the simulations.

在这项研究中，我们分析了自1997年至2024年间Advance Composition Explorer太空飞船观测到的80个3He丰富太阳高能粒子事件的光谱特性。我们将光谱分析分为两个标准：伴有快速和广泛日冕物质喷射的事件（称为“FW事件”）和伴有缓慢、狭窄或无日冕物质喷射的事件（称为“非FW事件”）。总的来说，我们发现伴有快速和广泛日冕物质喷射的事件在所有种类的粒子中表现出更均匀的光谱，并且它们的低能谱指数强烈相关，这表明日冕物质喷射提供了一种额外的3He丰富太阳高能粒子的再加速机制。此外，当比较没有与快速和广泛日冕物质喷射相关的事件中每种粒子的低能谱指数时，我们发现3He的谱硬度存在主要峰值，而Mg和Si存在次要峰值。最后，我们提出额外的再加速和/或传输机制可能在Fe和更重的离子的丰度增强中发挥作用，这也是需要进一步研究的问题。<br /><br />总结: 该研究总结了80个3He丰富太阳高能粒子事件的光谱特性分析，发现了日冕物质喷射对粒子再加速的影响，同时也观察到了3He、Mg和Si的谱硬度的不同峰值。此外，对Fe和更重离子的丰度增强提出了需要进一步研究的假设。 <div>
We analyze the spectral properties of 3He and 4He as well as the heavy ions (oxygen, neon, magnesium, silicon, and iron) in 80 3He-rich solar energetic particle (SEP) events observed by the Ultra-Low-Energy Ion Spectrometer on board the Advanced Composition Explorer spacecraft since its launch in 1997 until 2024. We split the spectral analysis into two criteria: events with fast and wide coronal mass ejections (CMEs; called “FW events”) and events with slow, narrow, or no observed CMEs (called “non-FW events”). Overall, we find that events with fast and wide CMEs exhibit more uniform spectra across all species, and their low-energy spectral indices are strongly correlated, suggesting a CME provides an additional reacceleration mechanism for the 3He-rich SEPs. When comparing each species’ low-energy spectral index for events with no associated fast-and-wide CME, we find a primary peak in the spectral hardness of 3He, and a secondary peak in Mg and Si. If we consider a plasma temperature of 1.0–1.3 MK, Mg and Si have a charge-to-mass ratio (Q/M) nearest to one-third (1/3), directly half that of 3He. Thus, our results support the results of Roth & Temerin, which suggest heavy ions resonate with the second harmonic of the same ion cyclotron waves energizing 3He. However, it is unclear why the Fe enhancement is not reflected in its spectral index, and we propose that additional acceleration and/or transport mechanisms are playing a role in the abundance enhancement of Fe and heavier ions.

In many cases accretion proceeds from disks onto planets, stars, white dwarfs, and neutron stars via a boundary layer, a region of intense shear where gas transitions from a near-Keplerian speed to that of the surface. These regions are not susceptible to the common magnetorotational and Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities, and instead global modes generated by supersonic shear instabilities are a leading candidate to govern transport in these regions. This work investigates the dynamics of these systems under a range of thermodynamic conditions, surveying both disk sound speeds and cooling rates. Very fast and very slow cooling have little effect on wave dynamics: In the fast-cooling limit, waves propagate in an effectively isothermal manner, and in the slow-cooling limit, wave propagation is effectively adiabatic. However, when the cooling timescale is comparable to the wave period, wave damping becomes extreme. In cases with intermediate cooling rates, mass and angular momentum transport can be suppressed by orders of magnitude compared to isothermal and uncooled cases. Cooling in accretion disks leads to a preference for wavenumbers near and below the Mach number of the disk; the corresponding lower frequencies can (in nonisothermal systems) couple to gravity modes within the star, potentially driving low-frequency variability such as dwarf nova and quasi-periodic oscillations in accreting systems.

总结:<br /><br />本文报告了对Fermi卫星探测到的GRB 200613A的光学观测和多波段分析。通过贝叶斯分块方法进行了及时光谱分析，确定了统计上最佳的时间区间。根据贝叶斯信息准则，数据通常支持Band+黑体(BB)模型。我们推测主要的Band成分来自Blandford–Znajek机制，而额外的BB成分来自中微子湮灭过程。根据我们的模型与数据的比较，BB成分对于低自旋、高吸积速率的黑洞中央引擎是显著的。余辉光曲线表现出典型的幂律衰减，并且其行为可以通过抛射物和恒定星际介质的碰撞来解释。模型拟合得到如下参数：XXX。此外，我们使用公共Python包Prospector对宿主星系进行了光谱能量分布建模。结果表明，宿主星系是一颗大质量星系（），具有适度的星形成率（yr−1）。这种星形成率与从观测光谱中推导的∼34.2M⊙ yr−1的 [O ii]发射线的星形成率一致。 <div>
We present our optical observations and multiwavelength analysis of the GRB 200613A detected by the Fermi satellite. Time-resolved spectral analysis of the prompt gamma-ray emission was conducted utilizing the Bayesian block method to determine statistically optimal time bins. Based on the Bayesian Information Criterion, the data generally favor the Band+blackbody (BB) model. We speculate that the main Band component comes from the Blandford–Znajek mechanism, while the additional BB component comes from the neutrino annihilation process. The BB component becomes significant for a low-spin, high-accretion-rate black hole central engine, as evidenced by our model comparison with the data. The afterglow light curve exhibits typical power-law decay, and its behavior can be explained by the collision between the ejecta and the constant interstellar medium. Model fitting yields the following parameters: erg, , , cm−3, degree, and . In addition, we employed the public Python package Prospector to perform a spectral energy distribution modeling of the host galaxy. The results suggest that the host galaxy is a massive galaxy ( ) with a moderate star formation rate ( yr−1). This SFR is consistent with the SFR of ∼34.2M⊙ yr−1 derived from the [O ii] emission line in the observed spectrum.

<div> LAEs, low dust attenuation, ODIN, Lyα equivalent widths, [O ii] and [O iii] emitters<br />
<br />总结:<br />Lyman-alpha-emitting galaxies (LAEs)是年轻、低质量、星形成的星系，其低尘埃衰减使得它们的Lyα发射在观测中发光明亮。ODIN项目利用定制窄带滤光片在不同宇宙历史时期发现了大量LAE候选星系。研究引入了一种新的双宽带连续光谱估计技术，提高了Lyα当量宽度的估计精度。通过该方法，在扩展的COSMOS区域发现了大约6032、5691和4066个z=2.4、3.1和4.5的LAE候选星系。在LAE样本中，[O ii]发射星系的污染很小，但类似绿豌豆星系的[O iii]发射星系在红移4.5样本中很重要。研究还引入了一种识别[O ii]和[O iii]发射星系的创新方法，使得它们能够作为不同类别的对象进行研究。对每个星系样本进行了放大的堆叠光谱能量分布的中位数分析，展现了选择方法的整体成功。同时，计算了LAE样本的Lyα当量宽度，发现当量宽度分布最适合以w0 = 53 ± 1, 65 ± 1 和 59 ± 1 Å的指数函数拟合。 <div>
Lyman-alpha-emitting galaxies (LAEs) are typically young, low-mass, star-forming galaxies with little extinction from interstellar dust. Their low dust attenuation allows their Lyα emission to shine brightly in spectroscopic and photometric observations, providing an observational window into the high-redshift Universe. Narrowband surveys reveal large, uniform samples of LAEs at specific redshifts that probe large-scale structure and the temporal evolution of galaxy properties. The One-hundred-deg2 DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) utilizes three custom-made narrowband filters on the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) to discover LAEs at three equally spaced periods in cosmological history. In this paper, we introduce the hybrid-weighted double-broadband continuum estimation technique, which yields improved estimation of Lyα equivalent widths. Using this method, we discover 6032, 5691, and 4066 LAE candidates at z = 2.4, 3.1, and 4.5 in the extended COSMOS field (∼9 deg2). We find that [O ii] emitters are a minimal contaminant in our LAE samples, but that interloping Green Pea–like [O iii] emitters are important for our redshift 4.5 sample. We introduce an innovative method for identifying [O ii] and [O iii] emitters via a combination of narrowband excess and galaxy colors, enabling their study as separate classes of objects. We present scaled median stacked spectral energy distributions for each galaxy sample, revealing the overall success of our selection methods. We also calculate rest-frame Lyα equivalent widths for our LAE samples and find that the EW distributions are best fit by exponential functions with scale lengths of w0 = 53 ± 1, 65 ± 1, and 59 ± 1 Å, respectively.

Joint observations in electromagnetic and gravitational waves shed light on the physics of objects and surrounding environments with extreme gravity that are otherwise unreachable via siloed observations in each messenger. However, such detections remain challenging due to the rapid and faint nature of counterparts. Protocols for discovery and inference still rely on human experts manually inspecting survey alert streams and intuiting optimal usage of limited follow-up resources. Strategizing an optimal follow-up program requires adaptive sequential decision-making given evolving light curve data that (i) maximizes a global objective despite incomplete information and (ii) is robust to stochasticity introduced by detectors/observing conditions. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches allow agents to implicitly learn the physics or detector dynamics and the behavior policy that maximizes a designated objective through experience. To demonstrate the utility of such an approach for the kilonova follow-up problem, we train a toy RL agent with the goal of maximizing follow-up photometry for the true kilonova among several contaminant transient light curves. In a simulated environment where the agent learns online, it achieves 3× higher accuracy compared to a random strategy. However, it is surpassed by human agents by up to a factor of 2. This is likely because our hypothesis function (Q that is linear in state-action features) is an insufficient representation of the optimal behavior policy. More complex agents could perform at par or surpass human experts. Agents like these could pave the way for machine-directed software infrastructure to efficiently respond to next generation detectors, for conducting science inference and optimally planning expensive follow-up observations, scalably and with demonstrable performance guarantees.

Solar filaments can undergo eruptions that result in the formation of coronal mass ejections, which can significantly impact planetary space environments. Observations of eruptions involving polar crown filaments, situated in the polar regions of the Sun, are limited. In this study, we report a polar crown filament eruption (SOL2023-06-12), characterized by fast downflows below the filament. The downflows appear instantly after the onset of the filament eruption and persist for approximately 2 hr, exhibiting plane-of-sky velocities ranging between 92 and 144 km s−1. They originate from the leading edge of the filament, and no clear acceleration is observed. Intriguingly, these downflows appear at two distinct sites, symmetrically positioned at the opposite ends of the conjugate flare ribbons. Based on the observations, we propose that the filament might be supported by a magnetic flux rope (MFR), and these downflows possibly occur along the legs of the MFR. The downflows likely result from continuous reconnections between the MFR and the overlying magnetic field structures and could either be reconnection outflows or redirected filament materials. We also observed horizontal drifting of the locations of downflows, which might correspond to the MFR’s footpoint drifting. This type of downflow can potentially be utilized to track the footpoints of MFRs during eruptions.

这篇文章总结了对20 pc范围内棕矮星质量分布的研究成果。棕矮星的质量与其可观测参数（光度、光谱类型或颜色）之间缺乏相关性，因此棕矮星质量函数的测量必须通过代理测量和理论模型来获得。研究利用各种质量函数形式、出生率函数、低质量截断和理论进化模型，建立了有效温度分布的预测形式，并找到了与观测到的有效温度分布最匹配的质量函数。最终得出了一个简单的幂律形式的质量函数，并确定了恒星形成的低质量截断。研究还发现出生率对温度分布的影响较小，但不同的出生率倾向于较小的幂指数值。研究中的代码可公开获取。此外，研究还通过模拟老年（8-10亿年）棕矮星的分布，提出了亚矮温度间隙的宽度和位置的发现。

After decades of brown dwarf discovery and follow-up, we can now infer the functional form of the mass distribution within 20 pc, which serves as a constraint on star formation theory at the lowest masses. Unlike objects on the main sequence that have a clear luminosity-to-mass correlation, brown dwarfs lack a correlation between an observable parameter (luminosity, spectral type, or color) and mass. A measurement of the brown dwarf mass function must therefore be procured through proxy measurements and theoretical models. We utilize various assumed forms of the mass function, together with a variety of birthrate functions, low-mass cutoffs, and theoretical evolutionary models, to build predicted forms of the effective temperature distribution. We then determine the best fit of the observed effective temperature distribution to these predictions, which in turn reveals the most likely mass function. We find that a simple power law ( ) with α ≈ 0.5 is optimal. Additionally, we conclude that the low-mass cutoff for star formation is ≲0.005 M⊙. We corroborate the findings of Burgasser, which state that the birthrate has a far lesser impact than the mass function on the form of the temperature distribution, but we note that our alternate birthrates tend to favor slightly smaller values of α than the constant birthrate. Our code for simulating these distributions is publicly available. As another use case for this code, we present findings on the width and location of the subdwarf temperature gap by simulating distributions of very old (8–10 Gyr) brown dwarfs.

总结: 
GS3 Hunter是一个基于深度学习的新方法，用于在星动力学数据中搜索亚结构和星流。该方法在FIRE宇宙模拟和Gaia和GALAH数据集的子集上进行了验证，并成功识别出相应的结果。此外，还应用于LAMOST数据集的K型巨星子集，识别出了已知的结构以及一些新的亚结构。GS3 Hunter有望成为一个有用的工具，帮助推进我们对银河系和局部星系团内外晕的理解，以及银河系周围的组装和潮汐剥离历史。<br /><br /> <div>
We present a novel, deep-learning-based method—dubbed Galactic-Seismology Substructures and Streams Hunter, or GS3 Hunter for short—to search for substructures and streams in stellar kinematics data. GS3 Hunter relies on a combined application of Siamese neural networks to transform the phase space information and the K-means algorithm for the clustering. As a validation test, we apply GS3 Hunter to a subset of the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) cosmological simulations. The stellar streams and substructures thus identified are in good agreement with corresponding results reported earlier by the FIRE team. In the same vein, we apply our method to a subset of local halo stars from the Gaia Early Data Release 3 and GALAH DR3 data sets and recover several previously known dynamical groups, such as Thamnos 1+2, the hot thick disk, ED-1, L-RL3, Helmi 1+2, Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, Sequoia, Virgo Radial Merger, Cronus, and Nereus. Finally, we apply our method without fine-tuning to a subset of K giant stars located in the inner halo region, obtained from the LAMOST Data Release 5 data set. We recover three previously known structures (Sagittarius, Hercules-Aquila Cloud, and the Virgo Overdensity), but we also discover a number of new substructures. We anticipate that GS3 Hunter will become a useful tool for the community dedicated to the search for stellar streams and structures in the Milky Way (MW) and the Local Group, thus helping advance our understanding of the stellar inner and outer halos and the assembly and tidal stripping history in and around the MW.

总结:
Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX)观测了来自太阳圈层的能量中性原子（ENA）通量，丰富了我们对太阳风与局部星际介质（LISM）相互作用的理解。研究人员提出了一个新模型，利用磁流体动力学模拟太阳风-LISM相互作用，并在通过太阳圈后传播捡起离子后分析了来自Voyager 2方向的IBEX观测。这项研究扩展了模型，包括了来自Voyager 1方向以及带状的低纬度部分。研究结果显示，Voyager 1方向的模型与Voyager 2方向的结果一致，并且中间带状部分的结果也能复现实际观测。最后，研究人员通过模拟展示了三个大压力波很可能在VLISM中合并，并被Voyager 1观测到为“pf2”，而至少其中一个波的效应在太阳圈层中被IBEX观测到，表现为2016年初ENA通量的短暂增强。 <div>
Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) observations of energetic neutral atom (ENA) fluxes from the heliosphere have greatly enriched our understanding of the interaction of the solar wind (SW) with the local interstellar medium (LISM). However, there has been recent controversy surrounding the inability of most ENA models to produce as high an intensity of ∼0.5–6 keV ENAs as IBEX observes at 1 au, especially as a function of time. In our previous study (E. J. Zirnstein et al.), we introduced a new model that utilizes a data-driven magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the SW–LISM interaction to propagate pickup ions through the heliosheath (HS) after they are nonadiabatically heated at the heliospheric termination shock. E. J. Zirnstein et al. only simulated and analyzed IBEX observations from the direction of Voyager 2. In this study, we expand our model to include fluxes from the direction of Voyager 1, as well as in the low-latitude part (middle) of the ribbon (10° below the ecliptic plane). We show that the model results at Voyager 1 are consistent with E. J. Zirnstein et al.’s results at Voyager 2 in terms of a secondary ENA source contribution of ≲20% from both directions. Our results in the middle of the ribbon also reproduce the data, when including a time-dependent secondary ENA source. Finally, we demonstrate with our simulation that three large pressure waves likely merged in the VLISM and were observed by Voyager 1 as “pf2,” while at least one of the wave’s effects in the HS was observed by IBEX as a brief enhancement in ENA flux in early 2016.

这篇论文使用Keck/LRIS和Keck/MOSFIRE光谱观测数据，研究了z ∼ 3星系的Lyα剖面形状与电离辐射逸出的关联。他们发现低速度分离vLyα,red的KLCS物体的电离辐射逸出比例显著更高。他们还发现Lyα剖面形状与fesc之间没有明显趋势。与文献中z ∼ 0.3的“Green Peas”星系的测量结果相比，KLCS对象在相同vLyα,red情况下具有更大的vsep和更高的fesc。作者得出结论，高红移源的Lyα剖面形状根本不同，vLyα,red等参数与fesc之间的关系也不同，并警告不要仅基于低红移矮星系的Lyα剖面构建重离子化时期的fesc诊断。
<br /><br />总结: 高红移星系的Lyα剖面形状与电离辐射逸出相关，低速度分离的KLCS物体具有更高的电离辐射逸出比例。Lyα剖面形状与fesc之间没有明显趋势。与z ∼ 0.3的“Green Peas”星系相比，KLCS对象具有不同的Lyα剖面形状和逸出比例。作者警告不要仅基于低红移矮星系的Lyα剖面构建重离子化时期的fesc诊断。 <div>
While the shape of the Lyα profile is viewed as one of the best tracers of ionizing-photon escape fraction (fesc) within low-redshift (z ∼ 0.3) surveys of the Lyman continuum, this connection remains untested at high redshift. Here, we combine deep, rest-UV Keck/LRIS spectra of 80 objects from the Keck Lyman Continuum Spectroscopic Survey with rest-optical Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy in order to examine potential correlations between Lyα profile shape and the escape of ionizing radiation within z ∼ 3 star-forming galaxies. We measure the velocity separation between double-peaked Lyα emission structure (vsep), between red-side Lyα emission peaks and systemic (vLyα,red), and between red-side emission peaks and low-ionization interstellar absorption lines (vLyα−LIS). We find that the IGM-corrected ratio of ionizing to nonionizing flux density is significantly higher in KLCS objects with lower vLyα,red. We find no significant trend between measures of ionizing-photon escape and vLyα−LIS. We compare our results to measurements of z ∼ 0.3 “Green Peas” from the literature and find that KLCS objects have larger vsep at fixed vLyα,red, larger fesc at fixed vLyα,red, and higher vLyα,red overall than z ∼ 0.3 analogs. We conclude that the Lyα profile shapes of our high-redshift sources are fundamentally different, and that measurements of profile shape such as vLyα,red map on to fesc in different ways. We caution against building reionization-era fesc diagnostics based purely on Lyα profiles of low-redshift dwarf galaxies. Tracing vsep, vLyα,red, and fesc in a larger sample of z ∼ 3 galaxies will reveal how these variables may be connected for galaxies at the epoch of reionization.

<div> 关键词: 质量间隙黑洞-中子星并合, 引力波, 恒星演化, 天体物理, 脉冲星

总结:
质量间隙黑洞-中子星（mgBHNS）并合是引力波事件中GW230529的一个重要组成部分，由孤立双星演化渠道形成。研究使用“延迟”超新星模型和合理的模型实现来模拟人口综合，结果表明我们的模拟可以同时匹配从人口分析推断出的mgBHNS和总BHNS并合的速率密度，以及LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration报道的BH质量在BHNS并合中的分布。GW230529对推断的mgBHNS速率密度贡献显著，因此我们建议GW230529可以通过孤立双星演化渠道解释。考虑AP4（DD2）态方程，GW230529发生撕裂的概率分别为12.8％（63.2％）。如果GW230529是一个撕裂事件，其金新星峰值视星等预测约为23-24等，并且可以被当前的观测项目和大型巡天望远镜发现。由于GW230529可能是GW观测推断出的非轴向事件，其相关的伽玛射线暴（GRB）可能太暗而无法被γ射线探测器观测到，解释了缺乏GRB观测。我们的研究表明由于GW230529的发现，通过孤立双星演化渠道形成mgBHNS并合的存在，表明BHNS并合仍有可能是发射引力波、伽玛射线暴和金新星的多信使源。虽然mgBHNS并合占据了宇宙学BHNS人口的约50％，但我们发现≳90％的被撕裂的BHNS并合预计来自mgBHNS并合的形成。 <div>
In this paper, we explore the formation of the mass-gap black hole-neutron star (mgBHNS) merger detected in gravitational wave (GW) event, i.e., GW230529, from the isolated binary evolution channel, and study potential signatures of its electromagnetic counterparts. By adopting the “delayed” supernova prescription and reasonable model realizations, our population synthesis simulation results can simultaneously match the rate densities of mgBHNS and total BHNS mergers inferred from the population analyses, along with the population distribution of the BH mass in BHNS mergers reported by the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA Collaboration. Because GW230529 contributes significantly to the inferred mgBHNS rate densities, we suggest that GW230529 can be explained through the isolated binary evolution channel. Considering the AP4 (DD2) equation of state, the probability that GW230529 can make tidal disruption is 12.8% (63.2%). If GW230529 is a disrupted event, its kilonova peak apparent magnitude is predicted ∼23–24 mag, and hence, can be detected by the present survey projects and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. Since GW230529 could be an off-axis event inferred from the GW observation, its associated gamma-ray burst (GRB) might be too dim to be observed by γ-ray detectors, interpreting the lack of GRB observations. Our study suggests the existence of mgBHNS mergers formed through the isolated binary evolution channel due to the discovery of GW230529, indicating that BHNS mergers are still likely to be multimessenger sources that emit GWs, GRBs, and kilonovae. Although mgBHNS mergers account for ∼50% of the cosmological BHNS population, we find that ≳90% of disrupted BHNS mergers are expected to originate from mgBHNS mergers.

总结:
在太阳系的边界区域，也就是太阳风终止震波和日球层之间的赫尔尼辣甚重要。本文使用自洽的混合动力学模拟研究了湍流对赫尔尼辣中离子分布的影响，并与旅行者号观测进行了比较，限定了湍流的振幅和可压缩性范围。结果表明，湍流耗散导致太阳风热离子的温度显著增加，从而增加了低能量处（约100电子伏）的ENAs的电荷交换源。然而，湍流的影响可能不足以完全解释这些不一致。<br /><br /> <div>
The distribution of ions in the heliosheath—the region between the heliospheric termination shock and the heliopause—is important for understanding remote observations of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs). The ion distributions were estimated previously based on hybrid simulations of the heating and evolution of solar wind and interstellar pickup ions across the solar wind termination shock, but these estimates only provide the distributions near the shock. In this work, we use self-consistent hybrid kinetic simulations to investigate the effects of turbulence on ion distributions in the heliosheath. The simulations are compared against Voyager observations, constraining the feasible amplitude and compressibility of turbulence. We find that the heating due to turbulent dissipation can lead to a significant increase in the temperature of thermal solar wind ions. Both turbulent velocity fluctuations and the heating of solar wind ions increase the charge-exchange source for ENAs at low energies (around 100 eV), where current ENA models underpredict observations by more than an order of magnitude. However, the effects of turbulence are likely not strong enough to fully explain these discrepancies.

<div> LHS 3154 b, 质量, 恒星, 行星形成理论, 模拟

总结:
LHS 3154 b是一颗质量为13.2倍地球质量的行星，围绕质量为0.11太阳质量的恒星运转。这一发现挑战了传统的行星形成理论，认为质量较小的恒星周围不会形成质量如此巨大的行星。研究人员提出了“打破锁链”情景的模拟，表明类似LHS 3154 b这样质量巨大且距离恒星较近的行星在模拟系统中出现的概率约为1%。这一结果暗示这些行星不需要特别不寻常的形成条件，而是已有的理论可以解释。另外，模拟系统中还包含大约30天公转周期的小行星，这为该假设提供了可能的检验。 <div>
Conventional planet formation theories predict a paucity of massive planets around small stars, especially very low-mass (0.1−0.3 M⊙) mid-to-late M dwarfs. Such tiny stars are expected to form planets of terrestrial sizes but not much bigger. However, this expectation is challenged by the recent discovery of LHS 3154 b, a planet with period of 3.7 days and minimum mass of 13.2 M⊕ orbiting a 0.11 M⊙ star. Here, we propose that close-in Neptune-mass planets like LHS 3154 b formed through an anomalous series of mergers from a primordial compact system of super-Earths. We perform simulations within the context of the “breaking the chains” scenario, in which super-Earths initially form in tightly spaced chains of mean-motion resonances before experiencing dynamical instabilities and collisions. Planets as massive and close-in as LHS 3154 b (Mp ∼ 12−20 M⊕, P < 7 days) are produced in ∼1% of simulated systems, in broad agreement with their low observed occurrence. These results suggest that such planets do not require particularly unusual formation conditions but rather are an occasional by-product of a process that is already theorized to explain compact multiplanet systems. Interestingly, our simulated systems with LHS 3154 b-like planets also contain smaller planets at around ∼30 days, offering a possible test of this hypothesis.

总结:
NGC 3718是一种近邻特殊星系，其光学形态受多重潮汐臂、扭曲盘和显著的弯曲尘埃巷的影响，但在近红外波段下，它看起来是一个以球状组分为主的星系。研究发现，这种扰动的形态使其成为研究潮汐扰动星系中恒星形成的理想案例。通过对星系进行分区，研究了恒星形成团的分布和特性。研究结果表明，次级并合事件可以触发星系盘的内部－外部生长，年轻的恒星形成团位于外潮汐臂而非内盘中。在中心盘区，恒星形成密度较大，恒星形成团的年龄也较大。 <br /><br /> <div>
We present a UV, optical, and near-IR study of the star-forming complexes in the nearby peculiar galaxy NGC 3718, using Ultraviolet Imaging telescope, Galaxy Evolution Explorer, Spitzer, and DECam Legacy Survey imaging data. The galaxy has a disturbed optical morphology owing to the multiple tidal arms, the warped disk, and the prominent curved dust lanes, but in the near-IR it appears to be a bulge-dominated galaxy. Its disturbed morphology makes it an excellent case to study star formation in a tidally disturbed galaxy that may have undergone a recent minor merger. To study the distribution and properties of the star-forming clumps (SFCs), we divided the galaxy within the R25 (B band) radius into three parts—the upper, central, and lower regions. Using the UV band images, we investigated the warped star-forming disk, the extended tidal arms, and the distribution and sizes of the 182 SFCs. Their distribution is 49, 60, and 73 in the galaxy’s upper, central, and lower regions, respectively. We determined the UV color, star formation rates (SFRs), star formation density (ΣSFR), and ages of the SFCs. The central disk of the galaxy has a larger mean ΣSFR that is ∼3.3 and ∼1.6 times higher than the upper and lower regions, respectively. We also find that the SFCs in the central disk are older than those in the tidal arms. Our study thus shows that minor mergers can trigger the inside-out growth of galaxy disks, where the younger SFCs are in outer tidal arms and not in the inner disk.

总结:
核心形成的主要机制是超大质量黑洞双星的清除作用和来自引力波反冲的加热作用。研究使用N体模拟模拟了四个具有超过0.5千秒差距的大质量椭圆星系的形成过程。结果表明，NGC 1600和A2147-BCG的核心尺寸小于1.3千秒差距，可以通过双星清除机制形成，而NGC 6166和A2261-BCG的大于2千秒差距的核心则需要引力波引起的加热作用。引力波加热作用会导致表面亮度变平，对应着真正的三维空间密度的平坦核心，并且会优先移除轨道角动量低的恒星离星系核心。 <br /><br /> <div>
Scouring by supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries is the most accepted mechanism for the formation of the cores seen in giant elliptical galaxies. However, an additional mechanism is required to explain the largest observed cores. Gravitational-wave (GW) recoil is expected to trigger further growth of the core, as subsequent heating from dynamical friction of the merged SMBH removes stars from the central regions. We model core formation in massive elliptical galaxies from both binary scouring and heating by GW recoil and examine their unique signatures. We aim to determine whether the nature of cores in 3D space density can be attributed uniquely to either process and whether the magnitude of the kick can be inferred. We perform N-body simulations of galactic mergers of multicomponent galaxies, based on the observed parameters of four massive elliptical galaxies with cores >0.5 kpc. After binary scouring and hardening, the merged SMBH remnant is given a range of GW recoil kicks with 0.5–0.9 of the escape speed of the galaxy. We find that binary scouring alone can form the cores of NGC 1600 and A2147-BCG, which are <1.3 kpc in size. However, the >2 kpc cores in NGC 6166 and A2261-BCG require heating from GW recoil kicks of <0.5 of the galaxy escape speed. A unique feature of GW recoil heating is flatter cores in surface brightness, corresponding to truly flat cores in 3D space density. It also preferentially removes stars on low angular momentum orbits from the galactic nucleus.

总结:
CME是一种复杂的磁化等离子体结构，其磁轴与黄道面角度不同，会受到不均匀和各向同性的星际磁场和太阳风的影响。研究使用EUHFORIA 3D模型进行模拟，关注CME倾斜度对其传播的影响。研究发现，CME的倾斜度会影响其保护层演变、磁流体动力学阻力和非径向流动。此外，研究还发现，随着距离太阳的增加，保护层持续时间会增加，而非径向流动在黄道面外更为显著。然而，在数值设定上无法解决阻力参数的倾斜度依赖性。 <div>
Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are complex magnetized plasma structures in which the magnetic field spirals around a central axis, forming what is known as a flux rope (FR). The central FR axis can be oriented at any angle with respect to the ecliptic. Throughout its journey, a CME will encounter interplanetary magnetic fields and solar winds that are neither homogeneous nor isotropic. Consequently, CMEs with different orientations will encounter different ambient medium conditions and, thus, the interaction of a CME with its surrounding environment will vary depending on the orientation of its FR axis, among other factors. This study aims to understand the effect of inclination on CME propagation. We performed simulations with the EUHFORIA 3D magnetohydrodynamic model. This study focuses on two CMEs modeled as spheromaks with nearly identical properties, differing only by their inclination. We show the effects of CME orientation on sheath evolution, MHD drag, and nonradial flows by analyzing the model data from a swarm of 81 virtual spacecraft scattered across the inner heliospheric. We have found that the sheath duration increases with radial distance from the Sun and that the rate of increase is greater on the flanks of the CME. Nonradial flows within the studied sheath region appear larger outside the ecliptic plane, indicating a “sliding” of the interplanetary magnetic field in the out-of-ecliptic plane. We found that the calculated drag parameter does not remain constant with radial distance and that the inclination dependence of the drag parameter cannot be resolved with our numerical setup.

<title>The Accelerating Decline of the Mass Transfer Rate in the Recurrent Nova T Pyxidis*</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The recurrent nova T Pyxidis (T Pyx) has erupted six times since 1890, with its last outburst in 2011, and the relatively short recurrence time between classical nova explosions indicates that T Pyx must have a massive white dwarf (WD) accreting at a high rate. It is believed that, since its outburst in 1890, the mass transfer rate in T Pyx was very large due to a feedback loop where the secondary is heated by the hot WD. The feedback loop has been slowly shutting off, reducing the mass transfer rate, and thereby explaining the magnitude decline of T Pyx from ∼13.8 (before 1890) to 15.7 just before the 2011 eruption. We present an analysis of the latest Hubble Space Telescope far-ultraviolet and optical spectra, obtained 12 yr after the 2011 outburst, showing that the mass transfer rate has been steadily declining and is now below its preoutburst level by about 40%: yr−1 for a WD mass of ∼1.0–1.4 M⊙, an inclination of 50°–60°, reddening of E(B − V) = 0.30 ± 0.05, and a Gaia Data Release 3 distance of pc. This steady decrease in the mass transfer rate in the ∼decade after the 2011 outburst is in sharp contrast with the more constant preoutburst ultraviolet continuum flux level from archival International Ultraviolet Explorer spectra. The flux (i.e., ) decline rate is 29 times faster now in the last ∼decade than observed since 1890 to ∼2010. The feedback loop shut off seems to be accelerating, at least in the decade following its 2011 outburst. In all eventualities, our analysis confirms that T Pyx is going through an unusually peculiar short-lived phase.

The end of supernova remnant (SNR) evolution is characterized by a so-called “radiative” stage, in which efficient cooling of the hot bubble inside the forward shock slows expansion, leading to eventual shock breakup. Understanding SNR evolution at this stage is vital for predicting feedback in galaxies, since SNRs are expected to deposit their energy and momentum into the interstellar medium at the ends of their lives. A key prediction of SNR evolutionary models is the formation at the onset of the radiative stage of a cold, dense shell behind the forward shock. However, searches for these shells via their neutral hydrogen emission have had limited success. We instead introduce an independent observational signal of shell formation arising from the interaction between nonthermal particles accelerated by the SNR forward shock (cosmic rays) and the dense shell. Using a semi-analytic model of particle acceleration based on state-of-the-art simulations coupled with a high-resolution hydrodynamic model of SNR evolution, we predict the nonthermal emission that arises from this interaction. We demonstrate that the onset of the radiative stage leads to nonthermal signatures from radio to gamma rays, including radio and gamma-ray brightening by nearly 2 orders of magnitude. Such a signature may be detectable with current instruments, and will be resolvable with the next generation of gamma-ray telescopes (namely, the Cherenkov Telescope Array).

<title>A VLA Study of Newly Discovered Southern Latitude Nonthermal Filaments in the Galactic Center: Polarimetric and Magnetic Field Properties</title>

A population of structures unique to the Galactic Center (GC), known as the nonthermal filaments (NTFs), has been studied for over 40 yr, but much remains unknown about them. In particular, there is no widely accepted and unified understanding for how the relativistic electrons illuminating these structures are generated. One possibility is that there are compact and extended sources of cosmic rays, which then diffuse along magnetic flux tubes leading to the illumination of the NTFs through synchrotron emission. In this work, we present and discuss the polarimetric distributions associated with a set of faint NTFs in the GC that have only been studied in total intensity previously. We compare the derived polarized intensity, rotation measure, and intrinsic magnetic field distributions for these structures with the results obtained for previously observed GC NTFs. The results are then used to enhance our understanding of the large-scale polarimetric properties of the GC. We then use the derived polarimetric distributions to constrain models for the mechanisms generating the relativistic electrons that illuminate these structures.

<title>Oxygen Isotope Exchange between Dust Aggregates and Ambient Nebular Gas</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Meteorites and their components exhibit a diverse range of oxygen isotope compositions, and the isotopic exchange timescale between dust grains and ambient gas is a key parameter for understanding the spatiotemporal evolution of the solar nebula. As dust grains existed as macroscopic aggregates in the solar nebula, it is necessary to consider the isotopic exchange timescales for these aggregates. Here, we theoretically estimate the isotope exchange timescales between dust aggregates and ambient vapor. The isotope exchange process between aggregates and ambient vapor is divided into four processes: (i) supply of gas molecules to the aggregate surface, (ii) diffusion of molecules within the aggregate, (iii) isotope exchange on the surface of constituent particles, and (iv) isotope diffusion within the particles. We evaluate these timescales and assess which one becomes the rate-determining step. We reveal that the isotope exchange timescale is approximately the same as that of the constituent particles when the aggregate radius is smaller than the critical value, which is a few centimeters when considering the exchange reaction between amorphous forsterite aggregates and water vapor.

<div> 关键词: Parker Solar Probe, Alfvén waves, magnetic switchback patches, heavy ion properties, Solar Orbiter

总结: Parker Solar Probe在靠近太阳的轨道上发现了大幅度的Alfvén波，在离散的磁场反转区域产生了磁场反转斑块。文章使用了Solar Orbiter的数据，发现这些斑块并没有区别于周围太阳风的离子和元素组成。同时，斑块和周围的太阳风都表现出快速和慢速风的特征，说明它们可能源自太阳日冕区域不同的磁场和热性质。研究还表明，可能是置换重连接和/或剪切驱动过程在斑块的形成中发挥了作用。<br /><br /> <div>
Since Parker Solar Probe’s (Parker’s) first perihelion pass at the Sun, large-amplitude Alfvén waves grouped in patches have been observed near the Sun throughout the mission. Several formation processes for these magnetic switchback patches have been suggested with no definitive consensus. To provide insight into their formation, we examine the heavy ion properties of several adjacent magnetic switchback patches around Parker’s 11th perihelion pass, capitalizing on a spacecraft lineup with Solar Orbiter where each samples the same solar wind streams over a large range of longitudes. Heavy ion properties (Fe/O, C6+/C5+, O7+/O6+) related to the wind’s coronal origin, measured with Solar Orbiter, can be linked to switchback patch structures identified near the Sun with Parker. We find that switchback patches do not contain distinctive ion and elemental compositional signatures different from the surrounding nonswitchback solar wind. Both the patches and ambient wind exhibit a range of fast and slow wind qualities, indicating coronal sources with open and closed field lines in close proximity. These observations and modeling indicate switchback patches form in coronal hole boundary wind and with a range of source region magnetic and thermal properties. Furthermore, the heavy ion signatures suggest interchange reconnection and/or shear-driven processes may play a role in their creation.

We present slick (the Scalable Line Intensity Computation Kit), a software package that calculates realistic CO, [C i], and [C ii] luminosities for clouds and galaxies formed in hydrodynamic simulations. Built on the radiative transfer code despotic, slick computes the thermal, radiative, and statistical equilibrium in concentric zones of model clouds, based on their physical properties and individual environments. We validate our results by applying slick to the high-resolution run of the Simba simulations, testing the derived luminosities against empirical and theoretical/analytic relations. To simulate the line emission from a universe of emitting clouds, we have incorporated random forest machine learning (ML) methods into our approach, allowing us to predict cosmologically evolving properties of CO, [C i], and [C ii] emission from galaxies such as luminosity functions. We tested this model in 100,000 gas particles, and 2500 galaxies, reaching an average accuracy of ∼99.8% for all lines. Finally, we present the first model light cones created with realistic and ML-predicted CO, [C i], and [C ii] luminosities in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, from z = 0 to z = 10.

Utilizing JWST MIRI/Medium Resolution Spectrograph integral field unit observations of the kiloparsec-scale central regions, we showcase the diversity of ionized gas distributions and kinematics in six nearby Seyfert galaxies included in the GATOS survey. Specifically, we present spatially resolved flux distribution and velocity field maps of six ionized emission lines covering a large range of ionization potentials (15.8–97.1 eV). Based on these maps, we showcase the evidence of ionized gas outflows in the six targets, and find some highly disturbed regions in NGC 5728, NGC 5506, and ESO137-G034. We propose active galactic nucleus (AGN)-driven radio jets plausibly play an important role in triggering these highly disturbed regions. With the outflow rates estimated based on [Ne V] emission, we find the six targets tend to have ionized outflow rates converged to a narrower range than the previous finding. These results have an important implication for the outflow properties in AGN of comparable luminosity.

The ϵ Lupi A (HD 136504) system stands out among magnetic massive binaries as the only short-period binary system in which both components have detectable magnetic fields. The proximity of the magnetospheres of the components leads to magnetospheric interactions, which are revealed as periodic pulses in the radio light curve of this system. In this work, we aim to investigate the magnetospheric interaction phenomenon in the X-ray domain. We observed this system with the XMM-Newton telescope, covering its orbital period. We observe variable X-ray emission with maximum flux near periastron, showing similarity with radio observations. The X-ray spectra show significantly elevated hard X-ray flux during periastron. We attribute the soft X-ray emission to individual magnetospheres, while the hard X-ray emission is explained by magnetospheric interaction, particularly due to magnetic reconnection. However, unlike in the radio, we do not find any significant short-term X-ray bursts. This exotic system may be an ideal target to study magnetospheric interactions in close binaries with organized magnetospheres.

通过采用k-ω模型，模拟了不同金属丰度和初始质量的氮序列Wolf-Rayet（WNL）星的演化，包括旋转和非旋转模型，并与经典的过冷模型进行了比较。结果表明，在相同的初始条件下，k−ω模型通常会产生更大的对流核心和更宽的过冷区，从而增加了WNL星的质量范围和寿命，并增加形成WNL星的可能性。WNL星的质量和寿命都随着金属丰度和初始质量的增加而增加。在高金属丰度条件下，两种过冷方案在WNL星的寿命上存在明显差异，但在WNL星的质量范围上差异不大。旋转可能会在低质量、金属贫穷对应体中促使WNL星的形成，这种效应在过冷模型中更为显著。在主序星相形成的富金属WNL星的表面氮可能主要来自CN循环，而在相对金属贫穷的对应体中可能来自CN和NO循环。我们的模型可以有效解释银河系中WNL星的分布，但似乎在解释大麦哲伦星云中的WNL星方面存在不足。 <br /><br />总结: 演化模拟表明，k-ω模型产生较大的对流核心和更宽的超越区域，增加了WNL星的寿命和形成可能性。WNL星的质量和寿命随金属丰度和初始质量增加而增加，而旋转有助于在低质量、金属贫穷对应体中形成WNL星。表面氮的来源在不同金属丰度条件下存在差异。这一模型解释了银河系中WNL星的分布，但解释大麦哲伦星云中的WNL星还存在不足。 <div>
We adopt a set of second-order differential equations (k − ω model) to handle core convective overshooting in massive stars, simulate the evolution of nitrogen sequence Wolf–Rayet (WNL) stars with different metallicities and initial masses, both rotating and nonrotating models, and compare the results with the classical overshooting model. The results indicate that, under the same initial conditions, the k − ω model generally produces larger convective cores and wider overshooting regions, thereby increasing the mass ranges and extending the lifetimes of WNL stars, as well as the likelihood of forming WNL stars. The masses and lifetimes of WNL stars both increase with higher metallicities and initial masses. Under higher-metallicity conditions, the two overshooting schemes significantly differ in their impacts on the lifetimes of WNL stars, but are insignificant in the mass ranges of the WNL stars. Rotation may drive the formation of WNL stars in low-mass, metal-poor counterparts, with this effect being more pronounced in the overshooting model. The surface nitrogen of metal-rich WNL stars formed during the main-sequence phase is likely primarily from the CN cycle, while it may come from both the CN and NO cycles for relatively metal-poor counterparts. Our model can effectively explain the distribution of WNL stars in the Milky Way, but appears to have inadequacies in explaining the WNL stars in the LMC.

We present a catalog of stellar parameters (effective temperature Teff, surface gravity , age, and metallicity [Fe/H]) and elemental-abundance ratios ([C/Fe], [Mg/Fe], and [α/Fe]) for some five million stars (4.5 million dwarfs and 0.5 million giant stars) in the Milky Way, based on stellar colors from the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) DR3 and Gaia EDR3. These estimates are obtained through the construction of a large spectroscopic training set with parameters and abundances adjusted to uniform scales, and trained with a kernel principal component analysis. Owing to the seven narrow/medium-band filters employed by J-PLUS, we obtain precisions in the abundance estimates that are as good as or better than those derived from medium-resolution spectroscopy for stars covering a wide range of the parameter space: 0.10–0.20 dex for [Fe/H] and [C/Fe], and 0.05 dex for [Mg/Fe] and [α/Fe]. Moreover, systematic errors due to the influence of molecular carbon bands on previous photometric-metallicity estimates (which only included two narrow/medium-band blue filters) have now been removed, resulting in photometric-metallicity estimates down to [Fe/H] ∼ −4.0, with typical uncertainties of 0.40 dex and 0.25 dex for dwarfs and giants, respectively. This large photometric sample should prove useful for the exploration of the assembly and chemical-evolution history of our Galaxy.

We explore the influence of radio-mode feedback on the properties of the cool circumgalactic medium (CGM). To this end, we assemble a statistical sample of approximately 30,000 radio galaxies with background quasars by combining optical spectroscopic measurements of luminous red galaxies and quasars from the year 1 data set of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and radio sources from the LOw-Frequency ARray Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) DR2 catalog and the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) quick-look catalog. Galaxies with similar optical properties but with no radio counterparts in LoTSS and VLASS are selected as the control group. We measure the cool CGM properties of radio galaxies and their control samples traced by Mg ii absorption lines, including covering fraction, rest equivalent width, and gas kinematics. Our results show no significant difference in the properties of gas around radio galaxies and their control sample, indicating that the operating radio-mode feedback of massive galaxies does not produce detectable effects on the properties of the cool CGM. Finally, we show that the CGM of radio galaxies contains a nonnegligible amount of cool gas with approximately 1010M⊙. This abundance can place a stringent constraint on the radio-mode feedback models.

Solar energetic particle (SEP) events are one of the most crucial aspects of space weather that require continuous monitoring and forecasting using robust methods. We demonstrate a proof of concept of using a data-driven supervised classification framework on a multivariate time-series data set covering solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. We implement ensemble modeling that merges the results from three proton channels (E ≥ 10 MeV, 50 MeV, and 100 MeV) and the long-band X-ray flux (1–8 Å) channel from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite missions. Our task is binary classification, such that the aim of the model is to distinguish strong SEP events from nonevents. Here, strong SEP events are those crossing the Space Weather Prediction Center’s “S1” threshold of solar radiation storm and proton fluxes below that threshold are weak SEP events. In addition, we consider periods of nonoccurrence of SEPs following a flare with magnitudes ≥C6.0 to maintain a natural imbalance of sample distribution. In our data set, there are 244 strong SEP events comprising the positive class. There are 189 weak events and 2460 “SEP-quiet” periods for the negative class. We experiment with summary statistic, one-nearest neighbor, and supervised time-series forest (STSF) classifiers and compare their performance to validate our methods for prediction windows from 5 minutes up to 60 minutes. We find the STSF model to perform better under all circumstances. For an optimal classification threshold of ≈0.3 and a 60 minutes prediction window, we obtain a true skill statistic TSS = 0.850, Heidke skill score HSS = 0.878, and Gilbert skill score GSS = 0.783.

Potential field source surface (PFSS) models are widely used to simulate coronal magnetic fields. PFSS models use the observed photospheric magnetic field as the inner boundary condition and assume a perfectly radial field beyond a “source surface” (Rss). At present, total solar eclipse (TSE) white-light images are the only data that delineate the coronal magnetic field from the photosphere out to several solar radii (R⊙). We utilize a complete solar cycle span of these images between 2008 and 2020 as a benchmark to assess the reliability of PFSS models. For a quantitative assessment, we apply the Rolling Hough Transform to the eclipse data and corresponding PFFS models to measure the difference, Δθ, between the data and model magnetic field lines throughout the corona. We find that the average Δθ, 〈Δθ〉, can be minimized for a given choice of Rss depending on the phase within a solar cycle. In particular, Rss ≈ 1.3 R⊙ is found to be optimal for solar maximum, while Rss ≈ 3 R⊙ yields a better match at solar minimum. Regardless, large (〈Δθ〉 > 10°) discrepancies between TSE data and PFSS-generated coronal field lines remain regardless of the choice of source surface. However, implementation of solar-cycle-dependent Rss optimal values does yield more reliable PFSS-generated coronal field lines for use in models and for tracing in situ measurements back to their sources at the Sun.

该研究介绍了一种名为LAISS的自动化流程，用于在实时数据流中检测异常的天体物理瞬变。他们利用统计的光变曲线和宿主星系的上下文特征，通过随机森林分类器在ZTF警报流上部署了异常检测模型，每晚识别大约1-5个候选异常进行专家审查并协调跟进观测。他们还展示了低延迟的近似相似度搜索方法，用于发现类似的瞬变模拟，进一步用于实时和回顾性搜索中的数据驱动发现、表征、重新分类和填补。他们报道了迄今为止发现的约325个瞬变，所有这些瞬变均在2018年至2021年之间观测到，并且不在公共目录中。这些方法使大容量数据流中的“海量数据中找到宝贵信息”变得系统化。由于它与ANTARES经纪人的集成，LAISS旨在检测鲁宾数据中的激动人心的瞬变。<br /><br /> <div>
We present Lightcurve Anomaly Identification and Similarity Search (LAISS), an automated pipeline to detect anomalous astrophysical transients in real-time data streams. We deploy our anomaly detection model on the nightly Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Alert Stream via the ANTARES broker, identifying a manageable ∼1–5 candidates per night for expert vetting and coordinating follow-up observations. Our method leverages statistical light-curve and contextual host galaxy features within a random forest classifier, tagging transients of rare classes (spectroscopic anomalies), of uncommon host galaxy environments (contextual anomalies), and of peculiar or interaction-powered phenomena (behavioral anomalies). Moreover, we demonstrate the power of a low-latency (∼ms) approximate similarity search method to find transient analogs with similar light-curve evolution and host galaxy environments. We use analogs for data-driven discovery, characterization, (re)classification, and imputation in retrospective and real-time searches. To date, we have identified ∼50 previously known and previously missed rare transients from real-time and retrospective searches, including but not limited to superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), tidal disruption events, SNe IIn, SNe IIb, SNe I-CSM, SNe Ia-91bg-like, SNe Ib, SNe Ic, SNe Ic-BL, and M31 novae. Lastly, we report the discovery of 325 total transients, all observed between 2018 and 2021 and absent from public catalogs (∼1% of all ZTF Astronomical Transient reports to the Transient Name Server through 2021). These methods enable a systematic approach to finding the “needle in the haystack” in large-volume data streams. Because of its integration with the ANTARES broker, LAISS is built to detect exciting transients in Rubin data.

<div> 关键词: gamma-ray bursts, afterglow observations, late-time jets, neutrino detection, IceCube-Gen2
总结: 
本文研究了伽马射线暴后的迟发射，即在观测到的100-1000秒后出现的X射线异常。研究估计了这些迟发射产生的中微子的检测可能性，并发现IceCube-Gen2通过堆积约1000-2000个事件有望实现中微子的检测。同时，文章还指出即使未检测到中微子，仍可以获得有意义的对迟发射特性的约束。文章的研究有望为未来的多信使观测提供重要的参考。<br /><br /> <div>
In gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), ∼100–1000 s after the prompt emission, afterglow observations have consistently shown X-ray excesses detected in the form of flares (in long GRBs) or extended emission (in short GRBs). These observations are interpreted as emissions from jets launched by late central engine activity. However, the characteristics of these late-time jets, particularly the dissipation radius (rdiss), Lorentz factor (Γ), and cosmic-ray loading factor (ξp), remain unknown despite their importance. Here, in order to understand the properties of the late-time jets with future multimessenger observations, we estimate the detectability of neutrinos associated with late-time emissions for a wide range of rdiss and Γ, assuming ξp = 10. We take into account external seed photons from the cocoon around the jets, which can enhance the neutrino production through photohadronic interaction in the jet dissipation region. Our results are still consistent with the upper limit obtained by IceCube. Our calculations indicate a promising prospect for neutrino detection with IceCube-Gen2 through the stacking of ∼1000–2000 events, for a wide range of rdiss and Γ. We found that setting an optimal energy threshold of 10 TeV can significantly reduce noise without negatively affecting neutrino detection. Furthermore, even in the case of nondetection, we show that meaningful constraints on the characteristics of the late-time jets can be obtained.

<br /><br />总结: 
本文重点研究了高能电子束在传播过程中的能量通量减少以及返回电流对加速电子束所携带能量通量的影响。通过系统计算，得出了在不同的束流和等离子体参数下，返回电流损失对能量通量的重要性，并估计了能量通量损失的程度。此外，还分析了在注入通量较高时可能出现的两种情况：一是失控电子的显著影响，二是电流驱动不稳定性的显著影响。最后，还讨论了返回电流对电子束反射的重要性，指出许多太阳耀斑的解释需要重新审视以考虑返回电流的影响。 <div>
High-energy electrons carry much of a solar flare’s energy. Therefore, understanding changes in electron beam distributions during their propagation is crucial. A key focus of this paper is how the cospatial return current reduces the energy flux carried by these accelerated electrons. We systematically compute this reduction for various beam and plasma parameters relevant to solar flares. Our 1D model accounts for collisions between beam and plasma electrons, return-current electric-field deceleration, thermalization in a warm target approximation, and runaway electron contributions. The results focus on the classical (Spitzer) regime, offering a valuable benchmark for energy flux reduction and its extent. Return-current losses are only negligible for the lowest nonthermal fluxes. We calculate the conditions for return-current losses to become significant and estimate the extent of the modification to the beam’s energy flux density. We also calculate two additional conditions that occur for higher injected fluxes: (1) where runaway electrons become significant, and (2) where current-driven instabilities might become significant, requiring a model that self-consistently accounts for them. Condition 2 is relaxed and the energy flux losses are reduced in the presence of runaway electrons. All results are dependent on beam and cospatial plasma parameters. We also examine the importance of the reflection of beam electrons by the return-current electric field. We show that the interpretation of a number of flares needs to be reviewed to account for the effects of return currents.

<title>Effects of Bursty Star Formation on [C ii] Line Intensity Mapping of High-redshift Galaxies</title>

<div> 高红移、星系形成、线强度映射、[C II] 158 微米线、突发星形成<br />
总结:<br />
研究发现，在高红移星系中突发星形成现象普遍存在，表现为[C II] 158 微米线的强度映射。为了理解突发星形成对[C II]线强度映射的影响，文章提出了一个解释高红移星系形成和[C II]信号的分析模型。该模型的结果显示，突发星形成对低质量星系的平均星形成率和[C II] 发光度有显著影响，并且在[C II]功率谱中会产生大尺度聚类项的显著过量。因此，在建模和分析早期宇宙中的[C II]数据集时，必须考虑突发性，并且在极端情况下，突发性的特征可能会被第一代实验如TIME、CONCERTO和CCAT-DSS所发现。 <div>
Bursty star formation—a key prediction for high-redshift galaxies from cosmological simulations explicitly resolving stellar feedback in the interstellar medium—has recently been observed to prevail among galaxies at redshift z ≳ 6. Line intensity mapping (LIM) of the 158 μm [C ii] line as a star formation rate (SFR) indicator offers unique opportunities to tomographically constrain cosmic star formation at high redshift, in a way complementary to observations of individually detected galaxies. To understand the effects of bursty star formation on [C ii] LIM, which have remained unexplored in previous studies, we present an analytic modeling framework for high-z galaxy formation and [C ii] LIM signals that accounts for bursty star formation histories induced by delayed supernova feedback. We use it to explore and characterize how bursty star formation can impact and thus complicate the interpretation of the [C ii] luminosity function and power spectrum. Our simple analytic model indicates that bursty star formation mainly affects low-mass galaxies by boosting their average SFR and [C ii] luminosity, and in the [C ii] power spectrum it can create a substantial excess in the large-scale clustering term. This distortion results in a power spectrum shape that cannot be explained by invoking a mass-independent logarithmic scatter. We conclude that burstiness must be accounted for when modeling and analyzing [C ii] data sets from the early Universe, and that in the extreme, the signature of burstiness may be detectable with first-generation experiments such as TIME, CONCERTO, and CCAT-DSS.

<div> 星际丰度，56Fe，NDAF，SNe Ia，化学丰度<br />
NDAF在太阳邻域的化学丰度演化中扮演重要角色，通过研究铁的演变和金属量比随着时间的变化，发现了NDAF对金属丰度的贡献。太阳邻域的金属丰度在SNe Ia之前逐渐增加，在考虑NDAF的情况下，由于铁的增加，金属贫乏星的金属量分布得到改善，而且还能够复现观测到的[Mg/Fe]的演变。这些结果深入理解了太阳环境中金属丰度的演化。 <br /><br />总结: <br />核崩解超新星在早期起主导作用，而Ia型超新星在后期起主导作用；NDAF对金属丰度的贡献尤为重要；NDAF的考虑改善了金属贫乏星的金属量分布；NDAF可复现[Mg/Fe]的观测到的演变变化；进一步加深了对太阳环境中金属丰度演化的理解。 <div>
The elemental abundances of stars reflect the complex enrichment history of the Galaxy. To explore and explain the metal enrichment history of the cosmic environment near our solar system, we study the evolution of 56Fe abundance over time and [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] evolution in the solar neighborhood. Core-collapse supernovae make the dominant contribution in the early stages, while Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have a delayed and dominant impact in the later stages. In this work, we consider the nucleosynthesis contribution of neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs) formed at the end of the lives of massive stars. The results show that the [Fe/H] gradually increases over time and eventually reaches [Fe/H] = 0 and above, reproducing the chemical enrichment process in the solar neighborhood. Before the onset of SNe Ia, the ratio of 56Fe mass to the total gas mass increases by a factor of at most ∼1.44 when NDAFs are taken into account. We find that by including NDAF in our models, the agreement with the observed metallicity distribution of metal-poor stars in the solar neighborhood (<1 kpc) is improved while not significantly altering the location of the metallicity peak. This inclusion can also reproduce the observed evolutionary change of [Mg/Fe] at [Fe/H] ∼ −1.22, bringing the ratio to match the solar abundance. Our results provide an extensive understanding of metallicity evolution in solar environments by highlighting the nucleosynthesis contribution of NDAF outflows in the solar neighborhood.

领先的狭窄射线射电星系（“星系A”，zA = 0.6850）镜像了一个背景亚毫米星系（zSMG = 2.221）的罕见情况。MMT/Binospec的新光谱证实了伴星系（“星系B”）是镜像系统的一部分，其zB = 0.6835。Hubble Space Telescope的新的三色数据显示完整的爱因斯坦环，并允许更精确的透镜模型。新的HST图像还显示了星系A周围的扩展发射，光谱显示出不规则形态的扩展[O ii]发射和复杂的速度结构。所有迹象表明，两个透镜星系是一个引力相互作用的对。星系A和B的强烈[O ii]发射表明目前有恒星形成，这可能是相互作用的结果。这表明比以前假设的更年轻的恒星群，并暗示了相同亮度的较小恒星质量。改进的透镜模型和扩展的光谱能够更好地估算前景星系的恒星质量。由此得出的暗物质部分约为0.8，比以前计算的要高。更深入的Chandra成像显示了扩展的X射线发射，但没有证据表明与任何星系相关的X射线点源。从3C 220.3的射电叶发射检测出X射线，估计叶中磁场约为3 nT，这是典型射电星系的平衡场的大约3倍。 <br /><br />总结: 3C 220.3系统是一个罕见的案例，其中前景窄线射电星系镜像了一个背景亚毫米星系。透镜模型经过改进，能够更好地估算前景星系的恒星质量，得出的暗物质部分约为0.8。而深入的Chandra成像显示了扩展的X射线发射，但没有与任何星系相关的X射线点源。 <div>
The 3C 220.3 system is a rare case of a foreground narrow-line radio galaxy (“galaxy A,” zA = 0.6850) lensing a background submillimeter galaxy (zSMG = 2.221). New spectra from MMT/Binospec confirm that the companion galaxy (“galaxy B”) is part of the lensing system with zB = 0.6835. New three-color Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data reveal a full Einstein ring and allow a more precise lens model. The new HST images also reveal extended emission around galaxy A, and the spectra show extended [O ii] emission with irregular morphology and complex velocity structure. All indications are that the two lensing galaxies are a gravitationally interacting pair. Strong [O ii] emission from both galaxies A and B suggests current star formation, which could be a consequence of the interaction. This would indicate a younger stellar population than previously assumed and imply smaller stellar masses for the same luminosity. The improved lens model and expanded spectral energy distributions have enabled better stellar mass estimates for the foreground galaxies. The resulting dark matter fractions are ∼0.8, which are higher than previously calculated. Deeper Chandra imaging shows extended X-ray emission but no evidence for an X-ray point source associated with either galaxy. The detection of X-rays from the radio lobes of 3C 220.3 allows an estimate of ∼3 nT for the magnetic fields in the lobes, a factor of ∼3 below the equipartition fields, as is typical for radio galaxies.

Enzo-N是一个GPU加速的混合流体/ N体模拟代码，通过半静态背景加速度近似成功地模拟了星团和宿主星系的共同演化。 Enzo-N的创新之处在于将直接N体模拟代码集成到宇宙学（磁）流体动力学代码中，捕捉了星团的核心坍缩和潮汐剥离等重要现象。这一全面的框架为研究星团在星系中的演化提供了新的可能性，提供了以前无法获得的见解。 <div>
We introduce a GPU-accelerated hybrid hydro/N-body code (Enzo-N) designed to address the challenges of concurrently simulating star clusters and their parent galaxies. This task has been exceedingly challenging, primarily due to the considerable computational time required, which stems from the substantial scale difference between galaxies (∼0.1 Mpc) and star clusters (∼parsecs). Yet, this significant scale separation means that particles within star clusters perceive those outside the star cluster in a semistationary state. By leveraging this aspect, we integrate a direct N-body code (Nbody6++GPU) into a cosmological (magneto)hydrodynamic code (Enzo) through utilization of the semistationary background acceleration approximation. We solve the dynamics of particles within star clusters using a direct N-body solver with regularization for few-body interactions, while evolving particles outside—dark matter, gas, and stars—using a particle-mesh gravity solver and hydrodynamic methods. We demonstrate that Enzo-N successfully simulates the coevolution of star clusters and their parent galaxies, capturing phenomena such as core collapse of the star cluster and tidal stripping due to galactic tides. This comprehensive framework opens up new possibilities for studying the evolution of star clusters within galaxies, offering insights that were previously inaccessible.

Water must condense into ice clouds in the coldest brown dwarfs and exoplanets. When they form, these icy clouds change the emergent spectra, temperature structure, and albedo of the substellar atmosphere. The properties of clouds are governed by complex microphysics but these complexities are often not captured by the simpler parameterized cloud models used in climate models or retrieval models. Here, we combine microphysical cloud modeling and 1D climate modeling to incorporate insights from microphysical models into a self-consistent, parameterized cloud model. Using the 1D Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA), we generate microphysical water clouds and compare their properties with those from the widely used EddySed cloud model for a grid of Y dwarfs. We find that the mass of water condensate in our CARMA water clouds is significantly limited by available condensation nuclei; in models without additional seed particles for clouds added, the atmosphere becomes supersaturated. We incorporate water latent heat release in the convective and radiative parts of the atmosphere and find no significant impact on water-ice cloud formation for typical gas giant compositions. Our analysis reveals the CARMA cloud profiles have a gradual decrease in opacity of approximately 4% per bar below the cloud base. Incorporating this gradual cloud base falloff and a variable fsed parameter allows spectra generated from the parameterized Eddysed model to better match those of the microphysical CARMA model. This work provides recommendations for efficiently generating microphysically informed water clouds for future models of cold substellar objects with H/He atmospheres.

该研究通过测量M82的星系晕端星形成结束时间（t90）和金属丰度（[M/H]）以及NGC 3077的东部潮汐尾的特征，来验证M82是否具有真正的星系晕，确定NGC 3077的潮汐破碎是否与星形成历史有关，以及创建M81星系群中心三个星系的组装历史时间表。研究结果表明，M82具有一个真正的金属贫瘠星系晕，形成于约66亿年前的一个小卫星星系的合并过程。NGC 3077潮汐尾中的恒星形成在与M81之前，且金属丰度大致均匀，表明NGC 3077的原型具有显著的人群梯度。最后，该研究呈现了中心三星系的并购/相互作用历史时间表。 <div>
Mergers of and interactions between galaxies imprint a wide diversity of morphological, dynamical, and chemical characteristics in stellar halos and tidal streams. Measuring these characteristics elucidates aspects of the progenitors of the galaxies we observe today. The M81 group is the perfect galaxy group to understand the past, present, and future of a group of galaxies in the process of merging. Here, we measure the end of star formation (t90) and metallicity ([M/H]) of the stellar halo of M82 and the eastern tidal stream of NGC 3077 to: (1) test the idea that M82 possesses a genuine stellar halo, formed before any interaction with M81; (2) determine if NGC 3077's tidal disruption is related to the star formation history in its tails; and (3) create a timeline of the assembly history of the central trio in the M81 group. We argue that M82 possesses a genuine, metal-poor ([M/H] ∼ −1.62 dex) stellar halo, formed from the merger of a small satellite galaxy roughly 6.6 Gyr ago. We also find that the stars present in NGC 3077's tails formed before tidal disruption with M81, and possess a roughly uniform metallicity as shown in S. Okamoto et al., implying that NGC 3077's progenitor had significant population gradients. Finally, we present a timeline of the central trio’s merger/interaction history.

<div> 频率选择，天空遮蔽，Planck 2018温度数据，透镜异常，宇宙学模型

总结：<br /><br />这篇文章重新审视了Planck 2018年温度（TT）数据中的透镜异常，并检查了其对频率选择和额外天空遮蔽的稳健性。研究的主要发现包括：（1）现象学的透镜振幅参数AL随黄道纬度变化，在黄道附近有AL>1的2.9σ偏好，在黄道极附近有1.0σ偏好，这种行为主要源自或完全源自217 GHz，暗示了一些非随机效应。 （2）217 GHz的TT数据也显示出比较低频率更强的AL>1的偏好。从217 GHz数据中剔除银河尘埃遮罩后的AL变化过大，不能仅仅用统计波动来解释，表明与前景处理有关。总体来看，Planck AL异常并非单一简单原因所致。从217 GHz TT数据中删除后，AL>1的偏好降至1.8σ。低多极（ℓ < 30）的TT数据通过与ΛCDM参数的相关性贡献了AL>1的偏好。在ℓ≥30时，100和143 GHz的数据对AL>1的偏好达到1.3σ，且在我们进行的遮蔽测试中似乎很稳健。透镜异常可能影响对替代宇宙学模型的拟合。通过对Planck TT谱线可选地应用AL边缘化可以检查这一点。提出用于解决宇宙学张力的模型应对Planck 217 GHz TT数据的剔除具有稳健性。 <div>
We revisit the lensing anomaly in the Planck 2018 temperature (TT) data and examine its robustness to frequency selection and additional sky masking. Our main findings are as follows. (1) The phenomenological lensing amplitude parameter, AL, varies with ecliptic latitude, with a 2.9σ preference for AL > 1 near the ecliptic and 1.0σ preference near the ecliptic poles, compared to 2.5σ on the original masks. This behavior is largely or solely from 217 GHz and suggestive of some nonrandom effect, given the Planck scan strategy. (2) The 217 GHz TT data also show a stronger preference for AL > 1 than the lower frequencies. The shifts in AL from 217 GHz with additional Galactic dust masking are too large to be explained solely by statistical fluctuations, indicating some connection with the foreground treatment. Overall, the Planck AL anomaly does not have a single simple cause. Removing the 217 GHz TT data leaves a 1.8σ preference for AL > 1. The low-multipole (ℓ < 30) TT data contribute to the preference for AL > 1 through correlations with ΛCDM parameters. The 100 and 143 GHz data at ℓ ≥ 30 prefer AL > 1 at 1.3σ, and this appears robust to the masking tests we performed. The lensing anomaly may impact fits to alternative cosmological models. Marginalizing over AL, optionally applied only to Planck TT spectra, can check this. Models proposed to address cosmological tensions should be robust to removal of the Planck 217 GHz TT data.

The first generations of stars left their chemical fingerprints on metal-poor stars in the Milky Way and its surrounding dwarf galaxies. While instantaneous and homogeneous enrichment implies that groups of conatal stars should have the same element abundances, small amplitudes of abundance scatter are seen at fixed [Fe/H]. Measurements of intrinsic abundance scatter have been made with small high-resolution spectroscopic data sets where measurement uncertainty is small compared to this scatter. In this work, we present a method to use mid-resolution survey data, which have larger errors, to make this measurement. Using APOGEE Data Release 17, we calculate the intrinsic scatter of Al, O, Mg, Si, Ti, Ni, and Mn relative to Fe for 333 metal-poor stars across six classical dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way, and 1604 stars across 19 globular clusters (GCs). We calibrate the reported abundance errors in bins of signal-to-noise ratio and [Fe/H] using a high-fidelity halo data set. Applying these calibrated errors to the APOGEE data, we find small amplitudes of average intrinsic abundance scatter in dwarf galaxies ranging from 0.03 to 0.09 dex, with a median value of 0.047 dex. For the GCs, we find intrinsic scatters ranging from 0.01 to 0.11 dex, with particularly high scatter for Al and O. Our measurements of intrinsic abundance scatter place important upper bounds, which are limited by our calibration, on the intrinsic scatter in these systems, as well as constraints on their underlying star formation history and mixing that we can look to simulations to interpret.

<div> close X-ray binaries, Wolf-Rayet donor, binary population synthesis, common-envelope ejection, mass transfer stability<br />总结:<br />IC 10 X-1是一个密切的X射线双星系统，其中包含一个Wolf-Rayet捐赠者，可以提供高质量X射线双星和引力波源之间的进化联系。研究认为IC 10 X-1中的紧凑天体更可能是黑洞而不是中子星，其质量约为10-30个太阳质量。研究采用了新的标准来模拟类似IC 10 X-1的双星系统的形成，提出了这些系统形成时可能避免了共同包层演化的观点。 <div>
IC 10 X-1 is one of the close X-ray binaries containing a Wolf–Rayet donor, which can provide an evolutionary link between high-mass X-ray binaries and gravitational wave sources. It is still unclear about the precise nature of the accreting compact object in IC 10 X-1, although it looks more like a black hole (BH) than a neutron star. In this work, we use a binary population synthesis method to simulate the formation of IC 10 X-1–like binaries by assuming different common-envelope ejection efficiencies. This work represents a big step forward over previous studies since we adopt new criteria for mass-transfer stability. These criteria allow the formation of IC 10 X-1–like systems without experiencing common envelope evolution. Based on our calculations, we propose that the compact object in IC 10 X-1 is a BH with a mass of ∼10–30 M⊙ and the progenitor evolution of this binary probably just experienced stable mass transfer.

通过使用WDEC模型和LPCODE模型对四个DAV进行天体测振拟合，发现两种模型计算出的周期相似。在放松化学配置要求的情况下，进行了同样的测定，并探讨了不同的加权方法和仅包括已知周期谱的影响。这些实验有助于确定未来使用WDEC对多个DAV和DBV进行天体测振拟合的方法。同时，对四个DAV进行了天体测振拟合，结果表明WDEC模型和LPCODE模型的一致性。总结：这项研究使用WDEC模型对四个DAV进行了天体测振拟合，并探讨了不同的加权方法和仅包括已知周期谱的影响。这有助于未来使用WDEC模型进行更多DAV和DBV的天体测振拟合。 <div>
We perform the asteroseismic fitting of four DAVs using a grid of WDEC models with chemical profiles that closely mimic those of the LPCODE models and compare them with published asteroseismic fitting results using the LPCODE. These four objects are KIC 11911480, J113655.17+040952.6, KIC 4552982, and GD 1212. The similarities in the results in those controlled experiments point to a consistency in the models. Given similar input, the LPCODE and the WDEC make similar models and calculate similar periods. We further perform the asteroseismic fitting of the same four DAVs by relaxing the constraints on the chemical profiles. We explore the effects of different methods for weighing the modes when calculating the goodness of fit of the models, as well as the effect of only including a subset of the known period spectrum. Such numerical experiments can help place recent and future efforts in the pipeline fitting of numerous DAVs and DBVs using the WDEC on a firmer footing.

<div> 关键词: 小麦云，红巨星分支，绝对校准，SARGs，变化性<br />
总结:<br />这篇文章研究了小麦云红巨星分支（TRGB）的绝对校准，使用了光学引力透镜实验（OGLE）分类的小幅度红巨星（SARGs）。研究表明，所有接近小麦云TRGB的星都是SARGs。通过区分A序列和B序列的年长和年轻红巨星，研究发现小麦云和大麦云的SARG族群存在许多相似之处，但也有显著的差异。利用变化性导出的信息，揭示了小麦云的年龄和金属丰度梯度，并表明其核心由年轻、金属丰富的红巨星组成。B序列提供了最明亮和最准确的校准（MF814W，syn = -4.057 ± 0.019(stat.) ± 0.029(syst.) mag），用于测量云彩之间的距离模数差异并研究金属度效应。未使用变化性信息的距离测量应采用基于靠近分支的所有星的SARG校准（MF814W，syn = -4.024 ± 0.041（stat.）± 0.029（syst.）mag）。这项工作强调红巨星群体多样性对TRGB距离测量的影响，需要进一步研究以揭示这些影响并改进TRGB标准化。 <div>
We investigate the absolute calibration of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using small amplitude red giant stars (SARGs) classified by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE). We show that all stars near the SMC’s TRGB are SARGs. Distinguishing older and younger RGs near the tip according to two period–luminosity sequences labeled A and B, we show many similarities among SARG populations of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the SMC, along with notable differences. In particular, SMC SARGs have shorter periods due to lower metallicity and smaller amplitudes due to younger ages than LMC SARGs. We discover two period–color relations near the TRGB that span all A-sequence and B-sequence stars in the OGLE-III footprints of the SMC and LMC, and we investigate using periods instead of color for TRGB standardization. Using variability-derived information only, we trace the SMC’s age and metallicity gradients and show the core to be populated by younger, more metal-rich RGs. The B-sequence yields the brightest and most accurate calibration (MF814W,syn = −4.057 ± 0.019(stat.) ± 0.029(syst.) mag), which we use to measure the distance modulus difference between the Clouds and investigate metallicity effects. Distance measurements not informed by variability should employ the SARG-based calibration based on all stars near the tip (MF814W,syn = −4.024 ± 0.041(stat.) ± 0.029(syst.) mag). Our work highlights the impact of RG population diversity on TRGB distance measurements. Further study is needed to unravel these effects and improve TRGB standardization.

<title>Balmer Decrement Anomalies in Galaxies at z ∼ 6 Found by JWST Observations: Density-bounded Nebulae or Excited H i Clouds?</title>

<div> 关键词: Balmer decrement anomalies, GS-NDG-9422, RXCJ2248-ID, z ∼ 6, physical modeling <br />
总结: 本研究调查了在z∼6的GS-NDG-9422和RXCJ2248-ID星系中氢的Hα/Hβ值明显小于2.7的巴尔默递减异常的物理起源。通过物理建模，发现了两种情况可以定量解释这些异常：(1) 具有小于Case B复合的光学深度的密度限制星云，(2) 部分/完全被光学厚的激发H i云所包围的电离限制星云。这些发现可能暗示了在高红移星系中由于大量吸积和超新星引起的过度碰撞激发的气体云。<br /> <div>
We investigate the physical origins of the Balmer decrement anomalies in GS-NDG-9422 and RXCJ2248-ID galaxies at z ∼ 6 whose Hα/Hβ values are significantly smaller than 2.7, the latter of which also shows anomalous Hγ/Hβ and Hδ/Hβ values beyond the errors. Because the anomalous Balmer decrements are not reproduced under the Case B recombination, we explore the nebulae with optical depths smaller and larger than the Case B recombination by physical modeling. We find two cases quantitatively explaining the anomalies: (1) density-bounded nebulae that are opaque only up to around Lyγ–Ly8 transitions and (2) ionization-bounded nebulae partly/fully surrounded by optically thick excited H i clouds. The case of (1) produces more Hβ photons via Lyγ absorption in the nebulae, requiring fine tuning in optical depth values, while this case helps ionizing photon escape for cosmic reionization. The case of (2) needs the optically thick excited Hi clouds with N2 ≃ 1012−1013 cm−2, where N2 is the column density of the hydrogen atom with the principal quantum number of n = 2. Interestingly, the high N2 values qualitatively agree with the recent claims for GS-NDG-9422 with the strong nebular continuum requiring a number of 2s-state electrons and for RXCJ2248-ID with the dense ionized regions likely coexisting with the optically thick clouds. While the physical origin of the optically thick excited H i clouds is unclear, these results may suggest gas clouds with excessive collisional excitation caused by an amount of accretion and supernovae in the high-z galaxies.

<div> 关键词: 大气层，热力锁定，外行星，朝晚各边，交接时间<br />
总结:<br />
本文讨论了大气不均一性对过境时间测量精度的影响，特别是对朝晚各边巨大温差的热力锁定外行星。研究指出，对于James Webb太空望远镜的观测来说，朝晚各边对总体透射光谱的贡献可以在一定情况下被准确分离。然而，大气不均一性与行星交接时间的不确定性之间存在高度重叠，可能导致对于大气不均一性的准确研究。文章推导了一个描述大气不均一性对视为交接时间变化的通用公式，并得出这种变化可能高达十秒。此外，文章还推导了一个关于这种额外数值偏差的分析公式。这些公式可以应用于新观测的计划或解释文献的测量结果，并给出了常见外行星的例子。 <div>
Atmospheres are not spatially homogeneous. This is particularly true for hot, tidally locked exoplanets with large day-to-night temperature variations, which can yield significant differences between the morning and evening terminators—known as limb asymmetry. Current transit observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are precise enough to disentangle the separate contributions of these morning and evening limbs to the overall transmission spectrum in certain circumstances. However, the signature of limb asymmetry in a transit light curve is highly degenerate with uncertainty in the planet’s time of conjunction. This raises the question of how precisely transit times must be measured to enable accurate studies of limb asymmetry, in particular with JWST. Although this degeneracy has been discussed in the literature, a general description of it has not been presented. In this work, we show how this degeneracy results from apparent changes in the transit contact times when the planetary disk has asymmetric limb sizes. We derive a general formula relating the magnitude of limb asymmetry to the amount by which it would cause the apparent time of conjunction to vary, which can reach tens of seconds. Comparing our formula to simulated observations, we find that numerical fitting techniques add additional bias to the measured time, of generally less than a second, resulting from the occultation geometry. We also derive an analytical formula for this extra numerical bias. These formulae can be applied to planning new observations or interpreting literature measurements, and we show examples for commonly studied exoplanets.

The intricate behavior of particle acceleration and transport mechanisms complicates the overall efforts in formulating a comprehensive understanding of solar energetic particle (SEP) events; these efforts include observations of low-energy particles (from tens of keV to hundreds of MeV) by space-borne instruments and measurements by the ground-based neutron monitors of the secondary particles generated in the Earth atmosphere by SEPs in the GeV range. Numerous space-borne missions provided good data on the nature/characteristics of these solar particles in past solar cycles, but more recently—concurrently with the rise toward the maximum of solar cycle 25—the High-Energy Particle Detector (HEPD-01) proved to be well suited for the study of solar physics and space weather. Its nominal 30–300 MeV energy range for protons can enlarge the detection capabilities of solar particles at low Earth orbit, closer to the injection limit of many SEP events. In this work, we characterize three SEP events within the first six months of 2022 through spectral and velocity dispersion analysis, assessing the response of HEPD-01 to >M1 events.

<title>Anisotropies of 40–139 keV Ions Measured beyond the Termination Shock and in the Very Local Interstellar Medium</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad7601</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We analyze the count rates of 40–139 keV ions that were measured in situ by the Low Energy Charged Particle instrument on Voyager 1 in order to identify the suprathermal ion anisotropies beyond the termination shock and in the very local interstellar (IS) medium (VLISM). The analysis results in a region of ∼9–10 au before the heliopause (HP) where the radial anisotropy of ions is negative, while the azimuthal ion anisotropy inside the heliosheath lies in the −T direction. In agreement to our previous analyses, we identify a positive radial anisotropy of ions up to at least ∼30 au beyond the HP, which becomes nearly zero from 2021 up to 2023 November (for ∼10 au). Notably, the anisotropy in the azimuthal direction is statistically zero throughout the upstream region, i.e., for ∼40 au past the HP, showing that the 40–139 keV ion anisotropy in the VLISM is only in the radial direction and has no azimuthal component. The presence of suprathermal ions of solar origin over such long spatial scales in the VLISM, along with the inflow of ions from IS space into the heliosheath, are important constraints for characterizing the interaction of the heliosheath with the VLISM. Our observations provide indications that V1 has entered a new regime in the VLISM since (at least) the year 2021, progressively developing characteristics akin to the pristine IS medium. Alternatively, this drop to nearly zero radial anisotropies beyond 2021 could be a manifestation of a prolonged compression/shock of solar origin.

<title>Very Extended Ionized Gas Discovered around NGC 1068 with the Circumgalactic Hα Spectrograph</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have performed wide-field, ultra-low-surface-brightness Hα emission-line mapping around NGC 1068 with the newly commissioned Circumgalactic Hα Spectrograph. NGC 1068 is notable for its active galactic nucleus, which globally ionizes gas in the disk and halo. Line-emitting diffuse ionized gas is distributed throughout the galactic disk and large-scale ionized filaments are found well beyond the disk, aligned with the cone angle of the central jet. We report the discovery of a new ribbon of ionized gas around NGC 1068 beyond even the known outer filamentary structure, located 20 kpc from the galaxy. The Hα surface brightness of this ribbon is on the order of the bright telluric lines, ranging from 4 to 16 R, with fainter regions on the order of the sky background continuum. Unlike previous extended emission, the ribbon is not as well aligned with the current axis of the central jet. It is not associated with any galactic structure or known tidal features in the halo of NGC 1068, though it may originate from a larger distribution of unmapped neutral atomic or molecular gas in the halo. The morphology of the ribbon emission in Hα is correlated with extended UV emission around NGC 1068. Hα-to-UV flux ratios in the ribbon are comparable to extended emission-line ratios in the halos of NGC 5128, NGC 253, and M82. The Hα excess in the ribbon gas suggests ionization by slow shocks or a mixture of in situ star formation and photoionization and collisional ionization processes.

这篇研究模拟了太阳耀斑极紫外晚期阶段对电离层电子密度的影响，使用了真实观测到的2012年10月23日X1.8级耀斑的太阳光谱驱动离子层-热层耦合模型。全球总电子含量（TEC）的观测和模拟显示，在极紫外晚期，白天电离层的TEC增加超过了耀斑主要阶段。研究还检验了模型在具有极紫外晚期的耀斑中的性能。结果显示，F层电子密度增强和恢复不能以与极紫外晚期的时间变化相同的速度变化，并且极紫外晚期的存在延长了电子密度的恢复约9小时。研究还发现，电子密度增强主要由化学产生决定，而电子密度的恢复主要受电场输运效应控制。这项研究加深了对地球空间环境和太阳耀斑极紫外晚期事件中类似行星系统的复杂物理和光化学过程的理解。

<br /><br />总结: 
1. 研究模拟了太阳耀斑极紫外晚期对电离层电子密度的影响
2. 使用真实观测到的太阳光谱驱动模型进行了研究
3. 结果显示极紫外晚期比耀斑主要阶段更能影响白天电离层的电子密度
4. 极紫外晚期的存在延长了电子密度的恢复时间
5. 电子密度的增强主要受化学产生影响，而恢复主要受电场输运效应控制。 <div>
Effects of the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) late phase of solar flares on the ionosphere were rarely studied. Here we simulated such effects on the ionospheric electron density using an ionosphere−thermosphere coupled model driven by the realistic solar spectrum observed during the X1.8 flare on 2012 October 23. Global total electron content (TEC) observations and simulations showed that the dayside ionospheric TEC during the EUV late phase increased more than that of the flare’s main phase. We examined the performance of the model for flares with EUV late phase. The results showed that the F-region electron density enhancement and recovery did not vary in the same pace as the temporal variations of the EUV late phase, and the presence of the EUV late phase prolonged the recovery of electron density by ∼9 hr. We also found that the enhancement in electron density was mainly determined by the chemical production, while the recovery of electron density was primarily controlled by the electric field transport effects. This study enhanced understanding of the intricate physical and photochemical processes governing Earth’s space environment and similar planetary systems during solar flare events with EUV late phase.

<div> 关键词: heliospheric current sheets, Voyager 2, solar maximum periods, magnetic reconnection, Parker spiral field

总结: 
本研究利用2008年至2018年间Voyager 2探测器的观测数据，对太阳风层中的赤道面电流片（HCSs）进行了分析。通过严格的标准，共发现了34个HCSs，这些变化表明磁极性发生了显著变化。这些现象在太阳活动最大期间更为普遍，当HCS扩展到较高的纬度时，与太空飞船平均定位在太阳赤道平面以南31°的纬度相吻合。我们确定了识别的HCS大尺度结构的某些特征。最重要的是，使用两种不同的方法表明，在太阳风层中HCS的厚度范围在0.003到0.4天文单位（au），平均厚度约为0.03到0.1 au，具体取决于事件选择和拟合技术。这个厚度超过了1 au或其他太阳风层距离时所知的厚度。这也明显比典型的质子惯性长度厚，暗示了磁重联的不利条件。此外，我们的分析揭示了HCS平面相对于太阳赤道平面的频繁倾斜，倾斜角度可高达数十度，可能意味着HCS在太阳风层内部常见的扭曲结构。从纵向上看，HCS平面与太阳风层中预期的Parker螺旋场方向紧密对齐。最后，对于识别的HCS事件的大部分，HCS平面可能具有旋转不连续性。这些发现在本研究中使用的1小时分辨率数据的限制范围内是有效的。 <div>
In this paper, we conducted an analysis of the heliospheric current sheets (HCSs) in the heliosheath (HS), utilizing observations by Voyager 2 between 2008 and 2018. Employing rigorous criteria, we identified a total of 34 HCSs that indicate significant changes in magnetic polarity. These occurrences were more prevalent during solar maximum periods when the HCS expanded to higher latitudes, coinciding with the spacecraft positioned at an average latitude of −31° from the solar equator. We determined certain features of the large-scale structures of the identified HCSs. Most importantly, employing two distinct methods indicates that the thickness of the HCSs within the HS ranges from ∼0.003 to ∼0.4 au with an average thickness of ∼0.03 to ∼0.1 au, depending on methods of event selection and fitting techniques. This thickness surpasses that known near 1 au or other heliospheric distances. It is also notably thicker than the typical proton inertial length, implying unfavorable conditions for magnetic reconnection. Additionally, our analysis reveals a frequent tilt of HCS planes relative to the solar equatorial plane by a varying angle up to several tens of degrees, likely implying a common occurrence of a warped structure of the HCS within the HS. Longitudinally, the HCS planes closely align with the Parker spiral field direction expected in the HS. Finally, for a large fraction of the identified HCS events, the HCS planes are likely characterized by a rotational discontinuity. These findings are valid within the limits of the 1 hr resolution data used in this study.

<div> 快速射电暴，窄带谱，角尺寸，多普勒效应，等离子体透镜

FRB的一些观测显示，它们的频谱非常窄，即Δν/ν0 ≪ 1。当射电暴的发射区域的角尺寸大于多普勒束缚角时，由于高纬度效应，观测到的谱宽(Δν/ν0)超过0.58，即使在源点的共动框架中谱线很窄。对于FRB的磁层模型，源的角尺寸可以小于多普勒束缚角，这种几何效应不会影响观测到的带宽。我们讨论了各种传播效应，以确定是否有任何可能将宽频谱射电脉冲转换为观测者位置的窄频谱信号。我们发现等离子体透镜和涟漪效应可能导致观测频谱的窄带宽。然而，在观测到的大量FRB样本中，具有Δν/ν0 < 0.58的窄谱观测谱的现象产生的可能性非常小。

<br /><br />总结：
本研究发现，一些快速射电暴具有极窄的频谱，即Δν/ν0 ≪ 1。在射电暴的发射区域的角尺寸大于多普勒束缚角时，由于高纬度效应，观测到的谱宽(Δν/ν0)超过0.58。磁层模型下，源的角尺寸可以小于多普勒束缚角。等离子体透镜和涟漪效应可能导致观测频谱的窄带宽。然而，在大量FRB样本中，出现具有Δν/ν0 < 0.58的窄谱观测谱的可能性非常小。 <div>
Observations find that some fast radio bursts (FRBs) have extremely narrowband spectra, i.e., Δν/ν0 ≪ 1. We show that, when the angular size of the emission region is larger than the Doppler beaming angle, the observed spectral width (Δν/ν0) exceeds 0.58 due to the high-latitude effects for a source outside the magnetosphere, even when the spectrum in the source’s comoving frame is monochromatic. The angular size of the source for magnetospheric models of FRBs can be smaller than the Doppler beaming angle, in which case this geometric effect does not influence the observed bandwidth. We discuss various propagation effects to determine if any could transform a broad-spectrum radio pulse into a narrow spectrum signal at the observer’s location. We find that plasma lensing and scintillation can result in a narrow bandwidth in the observed spectrum. However, the likelihood of these phenomena being responsible for the narrow observed spectra with Δν/ν0 < 0.58 in the fairly large observed sample of FRBs is exceedingly small.

While gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have the potential to shed light on the astrophysics of jets, compact objects, and cosmology, a major set back in their use as probes of these phenomena stems from our incomplete knowledge surrounding their prompt emission. There are numerous models that can account for various observations of GRBs in the gamma-ray and X-ray energy ranges, due to the flexibility in the number of parameters that can be tuned to increase agreement with data. Furthermore, these models lack predictive power that can test future spectropolarimetric observations of GRBs across the electromagnetic spectrum. In this work, we use the MCRaT radiative transfer code to calculate the X-ray spectropolarimetric signatures expected from the photospheric model for two unique hydrodynamic simulations of long GRBs. We make time-resolved and time-integrated comparisons between the X-ray and gamma-ray mock observations, shedding light on the information that can be obtained from X-ray prompt emission signatures. Our results show that the T90 derived from the X-ray light curve is the best diagnostic for the time that the central engine is active. We also find that our simulations reproduce the observed characteristics of the Einstein Probe–detected GRB 240315C. Based on our simulations, we are also able to make predictions for future X-ray spectropolarimetric measurements. Our results show the importance of conducting global radiative transfer calculations of GRB jets to better contextualize the prompt emission observations and constrain the mechanisms that produce the prompt emission.

We present an enhanced version of the publicly available Stripe 82X catalog (S82-XL), featuring a comprehensive set of 22,737 unique X-ray point sources identified with a significance ≳4σ. This catalog is four times larger than the original Stripe 82X catalog, by including additional archival data from the Chandra and XMM-Newton telescopes. Now covering ∼54.8 deg2 of nonoverlapping sky area, the S82-XL catalog roughly doubles the area and depth of the original catalog, with limiting fluxes (half-area fluxes) of 3.4 × 10−16 (2.4 × 10−15), 2.9 × 10−15 (1.5 × 10−14), and 1.4 × 10−15 (9.5 × 10−15) erg s−1 cm−2 across the soft (0.5–2 keV), hard (2–10 keV), and full (0.5–10 keV) bands, respectively. S82-XL occupies a unique region of flux-area parameter space compared to other X-ray surveys, identifying sources with rest-frame luminosities from 1.2 × 1038 to 1.6 × 1047 erg s−1 in the 2–10 keV band (median X-ray luminosity, 7.2 × 1043 erg s−1), and spectroscopic redshifts up to z ∼ 6. By using hardness ratios, we derived the obscuration of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), obtaining a median value of and an overall, obscured fraction ( ) of ∼36.9%.

该研究提出了一个分析双锥吸积模型，用于对低亮度活动星系核的视界尺度图像进行分析，包括事件视界望远镜（EHT）观测到的核心。研究的模型是基于一个轴对称的、磁化等离子体的同步辐射，该等离子体被限制在沿黑洞自旋轴对齐的两个相对定向的锥形结构内流动。研究表明，该模型能够准确复现各种时间平均的广义相对论磁流体力学模拟的图像，并且能够在贝叶斯推断框架下，使用射电干涉数据准确获得这些模拟中的黑洞自旋、方向、辐射尺度高度、峰值辐射半径和流体流向。此外，研究发现，对于稀疏阵列观测（如EHT 2017年对M87*的观测），相对论吸积流图像中的非平凡拓扑结构可能导致多模态解。这些重叠性的存在强调了使用贝叶斯技术对EHT测量结果进行充分取样的重要性。研究将模型拟合到M87*的EHT观测数据中，并得出质量与距离比θg ∈ (2.84, 3.75) μas的95%最高后验密度区间，并给出一个倾斜角度θo ∈ (11°, 24°)。这些新的测量结果与EHT和恒星动力学估计的质量测量以及M87*射流性质推断的自旋轴倾斜角度一致。<br /><br />总结: 该研究提出了一种用于分析活动星系核的视界尺度图像的分析模型，并在贝叶斯推断框架下对模拟和观测的数据进行了准确拟合，获得了与其他方法一致的结果。研究结果强调了使用贝叶斯技术对EHT测量结果进行充分取样的重要性。 <div>
We propose an analytic dual-cone accretion model for horizon-scale images of the cores of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei, including those observed by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Our model is of synchrotron emission from an axisymmetric, magnetized plasma, constrained to flow within two oppositely oriented cones that are aligned with the black hole’s spin axis. We show this model can accurately reproduce images of a variety of time-averaged general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations and that it accurately recovers the black hole spin, orientation, emission scale height, peak emission radius, and fluid flow direction from these simulations within a Bayesian inference framework using radio interferometric data. We show that nontrivial topologies in the images of relativistic accretion flows around black holes can result in nontrivial multimodal solutions when applied to observations with a sparse array, such as the EHT 2017 observations of M87*. The presence of these degeneracies underscores the importance of employing Bayesian techniques to adequately sample the posterior space for the interpretation of EHT measurements. We fit our model to the EHT observations of M87* and find a 95% highest posterior density interval for the mass-to-distance ratio of θg ∈ (2.84, 3.75) μas, and give an inclination of θo ∈ (11°, 24°). These new measurements are consistent with mass measurements from the EHT and stellar dynamical estimates and with the spin axis inclination inferred from properties of the M87* jet.

<div> 重复快速射电爆发，X射线和无线电观测，FRB 20220912A，X射线和无线电数据，观测方法，观测结果<br /><br />总结:
本研究对重复快速射电爆发源FRB 20220912A进行了为期8周的X射线和无线电观测。观测结果显示，在30次射电爆发期间未检测到显著的X射线发射，并且根据推断，X射线与射电的能量比值(ηx/r)小于7 × 10^6。此外，在FRB 20220912A的位置上也未观测到持续的X射线发射。研究还提出了一种层次化方法，可结合多次观测数据，得出了截至目前关于FRB ηx/r的最佳上界。最后，如果采用类似于2020年4月28日观测到的银河磁星SGR 1935+2154的X射线谱，将得出ηx/r的上界为8 × 10^5，仅为SGR 1935+2154观测到的ηx/r的3倍。 <div>
We present an extensive contemporaneous X-ray and radio campaign performed on the repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source FRB 20220912A for 8 weeks immediately following the source’s detection by CHIME/FRB. This includes X-ray data from XMM-Newton, NICER, and Swift, and radio detections of FRB 20220912A from CHIME/Pulsar and Effelsberg. We detect no significant X-ray emission at the time of 30 radio bursts with upper limits on a 0.5–10.0 keV X-ray fluence of (1.5–14.5) × 10−10 erg cm−2 (99.7% credible interval, unabsorbed) on a timescale of 100 ms. Translated into a fluence ratio ηx/r = FX-ray/Fradio, this corresponds to ηx/r < 7 × 106. For persistent emission from the location of FRB 20220912A, we derive a 99.7% 0.5–10.0 keV isotropic flux limit of 8.8 × 10−15 erg cm−2 s−1 (unabsorbed) or an isotropic luminosity limit of 1.4 × 1041 erg s−1 at a distance of 362.4 Mpc. We derive a hierarchical extension to the standard Bayesian treatment of low-count and background-contaminated X-ray data, which allows the robust combination of multiple observations. This methodology allows us to place the best (lowest) 99.7% credible interval upper limit on an FRB ηx/r to date, ηx/r < 2 × 106, assuming that all 30 detected radio bursts are associated with X-ray bursts with the same fluence ratio. If we instead adopt an X-ray spectrum similar to the X-ray burst observed contemporaneously with FRB-like emission from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 detected on 2020 April 28, we derive a 99.7% credible interval upper limit on ηx/r of 8 × 105, which is only 3 times the observed value of ηx/r for SGR 1935+2154.

Photometric classifications of supernova (SN) light curves have become necessary to utilize the full potential of large samples of observations obtained from wide-field photometric surveys, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. Here, we present a photometric classifier for SN light curves that does not rely on redshift information and still maintains comparable accuracy to redshift-dependent classifiers. Our new package, Superphot+, uses a parametric model to extract meaningful features from multiband SN light curves. We train a gradient-boosted machine with fit parameters from 6061 ZTF SNe that pass data quality cuts and are spectroscopically classified as one of five classes: SN Ia, SN II, SN Ib/c, SN IIn, and SLSN-I. Without redshift information, our classifier yields a class-averaged F1-score of 0.61 ± 0.02 and a total accuracy of 0.83 ± 0.01. Including redshift information improves these metrics to 0.71 ± 0.02 and 0.88 ± 0.01, respectively. We assign new class probabilities to 3558 ZTF transients that show SN-like characteristics (based on the ALeRCE Broker light-curve and stamp classifiers) but lack spectroscopic classifications. Finally, we compare our predicted SN labels with those generated by the ALeRCE light-curve classifier, finding that the two classifiers agree on photometric labels for 82% ± 2% of light curves with spectroscopic labels and 72% ± 0% of light curves without spectroscopic labels. Superphot+ is currently classifying ZTF SNe in real time via the ANTARES Broker, and is designed for simple adaptation to six-band Rubin light curves in the future.

本研究利用数值模拟表明星体速度分布与暗物质之间存在相关性。通过高斯混合模型，在化学动力学空间中将来自LAMOST DR8和Gaia DR3的K型巨星分为盘状结构、暗物质晕及各向同性暗物质晕组分。发现暗物质晕的子结构组分在径向上具有很高的各向异性，可能与Gaia–Enceladus–Sausage(GES)并入事件有关，而各向同性暗物质晕组分是接收自最早的并入，并且服从Maxwell–Boltzmann分布(标准暗物质模型[SHM]).研究发现GES样子的子结构组分占据了太阳附近约85%的本地非盘星体数量，这一结果对于不同体积切割和额外角动量约束的应用几乎没有变化。通过利用金属丰度-恒星质量关系和恒星质量-暗物质晕质量关系，我们发现本地暗物质中约有25%存在于这种动力学子结构中。结合非盘组分的恒星分布，我们修正了本地暗物质的太阳系速度分布。与SHM相比，速度降低，峰值更尖锐，更新了暗物质直接探测实验的检测限。本研究还讨论了GMM拟合中存在的退化，并建议未来更多动力学和化学信息，如α丰度，有助于打破这种退化。我们的工作证实了本地暗物质速度分布显著偏离SHM，需要在暗物质探测实验中得到适当的考虑。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究利用高斯混合模型对银河系内的恒星进行动力学学习，发现本地暗物质晕存在着高度的子结构成分，并且这一组分对于本地暗物质速度分布产生了重大影响，需要在暗物质探测实验中加以充分考虑。 <div>
Numerical simulations indicate that correlations exist between the velocity distributions of stars and dark matter (DM). We study the local DM velocity distribution based on these correlations. We select K giants from LAMOST DR8 cross-matched with Gaia DR3, which have robust measurements of velocity and metallicity, and separate them into the disk, halo substructure, and isotropic halo components in the chemodynamical space utilizing the Gaussian mixture model. The substructure component is highly radially anisotropic and possibly related to the Gaia–Enceladus–Sausage (GES) merger event, while the isotropic halo component is accreted from the earliest mergers following the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution (standard halo model [SHM]). We find that the GES-like substructure contributes ∼85% of the local nondisk stars in the solar neighborhood, which is nearly invariant when applying different volume cuts or additional angular momentum constraints. Utilizing the metallicity–stellar mass relation and the stellar mass–halo mass relation, we find that of local DM is in the kinematic substructure. Combined with the stellar distributions of nondisk components, we modify the heliocentric velocity distribution of local DM. It shifts to a lower speed with a sharper peak compared to the SHM and updates the detection limits of DM direct detection experiments. We discuss extensively the degeneracies present in the GMM fitting and propose that more kinematic and chemical information such as α abundance could help to break the degeneracy in the future. Our work confirms that the local DM velocity distribution deviates significantly from the SHM and needs to be properly accounted for in the DM detection experiments.

<div> Athena++, Monte Carlo radiation transfer module, RMHD simulations, super-Eddington accretion, hard X-ray emission
<br />总结:
研究利用Athena++模拟了超艾丁顿吸积率对黑洞的影响，焦点在硬X射线发射上。他们通过MC和RMHD模拟的比较发现，RMHD模拟中的灰色辐射传输模型低估了喷口区域的气体温度，而多能组模拟更符合MC模拟的结果，并产生了硬X射线辐射比灰色模拟更强的后处理光谱。他们还使用MC后处理光谱尝试直接拟合超光源X射线源的观测数据，结果发现第一原理模型可以很好地解释观测到的硬X射线光谱。 <div>
We use the Athena++ Monte Carlo (MC) radiation transfer module to postprocess simulation snapshots from nonrelativistic Athena++ radiation magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations. These simulations were run using a gray (frequency-integrated) approach but were also restarted and ran with a multigroup approach that accounts for Compton scattering with a Kompaneets operator. These simulations produced moderately super-Eddington accretion rates onto a 6.62 M⊙ black hole. Since we only achieve inflow equilibrium out to 20–25 gravitational radii, we focus on the hard X-ray emission. We provide a comparison between the MC and RMHD simulations, showing that the treatment of Compton scattering in the gray RMHD simulations underestimates the gas temperature in the funnel regions above and below the accretion disk. In contrast, the restarted multigroup snapshots provide a treatment for the radiation field that is more consistent with the MC calculations, and result in postprocessed spectra with harder X-ray emission compared to their gray snapshot counterparts. We characterize these MC postprocessed spectra using commonly employed phenomenological spectral fitting models. We also attempt to fit our MC spectra directly to observations of the ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) NGC 1313 X-1, finding best-fit values that are competitive to phenomenological model fits, indicating that first principle models of super-Eddington accretion may adequately explain the observed hard X-ray spectra in some ULX sources.

流体动力学模拟显示，当给定一个超爱丁顿回落速率时，流-流碰撞可以发生多次，并产生高达10^4太阳质量每秒的强流出。这些流出将气体分散到≳100rs，延迟了气体的循环，并导致前几次流-流碰撞期间次爱丁顿的吸积速率。碰撞和循环的冲击可以在数天内维持约10^44尔格每秒的亮度。这个亮度通常是次爱丁顿的，并且在早期与吸积速率呈弱相关。流出是光学厚的，产生一个大小约10^14厘米、光球温度约4×10^4开尔文的辐射层。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究在流体动力学模拟中发现，潮撕裂事件的早期发射和气体循环受到流-流碰撞的影响。在给定的条件下，流-流碰撞可以产生强大的气体流出，并延迟气体的循环。同时，产生的光度通常是次爱丁顿的，并且与吸积速率呈弱相关。产生的光度主要受到流-流碰撞和循环的冲击影响，同时产生的流出是光学厚的，产生辐射层。 <div>
The rising part of a tidal disruption event light curve provides unique insight into early emission and the onset of accretion. Various mechanisms are proposed to explain the pre-peak emission, including shocks from debris interaction and reprocessing of disk emission. We study the pre-peak emission and its influence on the gas circularization by a series of gray radiation hydrodynamic simulations with varying black hole mass. We find that, given a super-Eddington fallback rate of , the stream–stream collision can occur multiple times and drive strong outflows of up to . By dispersing gas to ≳100rs, the outflow can delay gas circularization and leads to sub-Eddington accretion rates during the first few stream–stream collisions. The stream–stream collision shock and circularization shock can sustain a luminosity of ∼1044 erg s−1 for days. The luminosity is generally sub-Eddington and shows a weak correlation with accretion rate at early times. The outflow is optically thick, yielding a reprocessing layer with a size of ∼1014 cm and photospheric temperature of ∼4 × 104 K.

<div> 关键词: Type Ia supernovae, early-time light curves, excesses, Zwicky Transient Facility, Hubble residuals<br />
总结: <br /><br />这篇文章研究了Type Ia超新星早期光变曲线的多个理论模型和观测到的flux excesses，以及这些过量的影响。作者使用ZTF观测到的SNe Ia的光变曲线进行系统性搜索，发现了17个SNe Ia具有显著的早期过量。研究发现，具有过量的SNe Ia在经过形状、颜色和宿主星系质量的校正后可能具有较低的哈勃残差。作者还比较了具有过量和没有过量的SNe Ia的宿主星系质量，发现它们大致一致，尽管具有过量的SNe Ia可能更倾向于较低质量的宿主星系。这些发现提供了理解SN Ia宇宙学潜在偏见和探索SN Ia前体物理的有效方式。 <div>
Flux excesses in the early-time light curves of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are predicted by multiple theoretical models and have been observed in a number of nearby SNe Ia over the last decade. However, the astrophysical processes that cause these excesses may affect their use as standardizable candles for cosmological parameter measurements. We perform a systematic search for early-time excesses in SNe Ia observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to study whether SNe Ia with these excesses yield systematically different Hubble residuals. We analyze two compilations of SN Ia light curves from ZTF’s first year of operations: 127 high-cadence light curves from Y. Yao et al. and 305 light curves from the ZTF cosmology data release of S. Dhawan et al. We detect significant early-time excesses for 17 SNe Ia in these samples and find that the excesses have a median g − r color of 0.10 ± 0.11 mag; we do not find a clear preference for blue excesses as predicted by several models. Using the SALT3 model, we measure Hubble residuals for these two samples, finding that excess-having SNe Ia may have lower Hubble residuals (HR) after correcting for shape, color, and host-galaxy mass, at ∼2–3σ significance; our baseline result is ΔHR = −0.056 ± 0.026 mag (2.2σ). We compare the host-galaxy masses of excess-having and no-excess SNe Ia and find they are consistent, though at marginal significance excess-having SNe Ia may prefer lower-mass hosts. Additional discoveries of early excess SNe Ia will be a powerful way to understand potential biases in SN Ia cosmology and probe the physics of SN Ia progenitors.

Plumes are considered to play an important role in the origin of the solar wind. However, an understanding of their thermodynamic evolution is not complete. Here, we perform a detailed study of a plume inside a coronal hole throughout its lifetime, using the observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager. We find that the plume’s formation is preceded by frequent occurrences of small-scale jets and jetlets at its base, leading to the gradual development of plume haze. The plume rapidly developed within the first 6 hr into its well-known morphology. Light curves from all extreme ultraviolet channels exhibit a similar profile, suggesting its multithermal nature and intensity modulation over its lifespan. Moreover, the photospheric magnetic field dynamics at the plume’s base are highly correlated with its light curve in 171 Å. We calculate outflow velocities, observed prominently in the 171 Å passband and mildly in the 193 and 211 Å passbands, with median speeds lower in higher temperature bands but occasionally comparable to the respective sound speeds. When data are averaged over larger spatial scales, the plume appears isothermal along its length, with constant temperature throughout its lifetime. However, an analysis of the differential emission measure at full resolution reveals the presence of higher-temperature plasma, indicating internal temperature structures within the plume. These results provide new insights into the formation, dynamics, and thermal properties of coronal plumes, placing tighter constraints on models to understand their thermodynamic evolution and potential role in the solar wind.

<div> X-ray, radio, tidal disruption event, multizone model, relativistic jets
总结: 
研究了AT 2022cmc这一近期发现的潮汐撕裂事件，发现其具有明亮的喷流， beg在X射线和射电观测中表现出快速下降的和长时间持续的辐射。通过提出一个涉及具有不同洛伦兹因子的相对论性喷流的多区域模型，系统地研究了快速和慢速喷流在外部密度分布中的演变，考虑了与时间相关的质量回落时间前后的连续能量注入率。研究了快速和慢速喷流正、反冲击区域的时变多波段辐射的自洽性。结果表明能量注入率可以显著影响喷流演变，并随后影响光变曲线。 X射线光谱和光变曲线可以通过更快喷流的反冲击区域的电子同步辐射来描述，其中延迟时间X射线的上限可以解释为喷流的突变。同时，射电观测可以解释为来自更慢喷流的正冲击区域的同步辐射。还讨论了通过当前和未来观测来测试模型的前景。 <div>
AT 2022cmc is a recently documented tidal disruption event that exhibits a luminous jet, accompanied by fast-declining X-ray and long-lasting radio and millimeter emission. Motivated by the distinct spectral and temporal signatures between the X-ray and radio observations, we propose a multizone model involving relativistic jets with different Lorentz factors. We systematically study the evolution of faster and slower jets in an external density profile, considering the continuous energy injection rate associated with time-dependent accretion rates before and after the mass fallback time. We investigate time-dependent multiwavelength emission from both the forward shock (FS) and reverse shock (RS) regions of the fast and slow jets, in a self-consistent manner. Our analysis demonstrates that the energy injection rate can significantly impact the jet evolution and subsequently influence the lightcurves. We find that the X-ray spectra and lightcurves could be described by electron synchrotron emission from the RS of the faster jet, in which the late-time X-ray upper limits, extending to 400 days after the disruption, could be interpreted as a jet break. Meanwhile, the radio observations can be interpreted as a result of synchrotron emission from the FS region of the slower jet. We also discuss prospects for testing the model with current and future observations.

In the emerging era of big data astrophysics, large-scale extragalactic surveys will soon provide high-quality imaging for billions of celestial objects to answer major questions in astrophysics such as the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Precision cosmology with surveys requires accurate photometric redshift (photo-z) estimation with well-constrained uncertainties as inputs for weak lensing models to measure cosmological parameters. Machine learning methods have shown promise in optimizing the information gained from galaxy images in photo-z estimation; however, many of these methods are limited in their ability to estimate accurate uncertainties. In this work, we present one of the first applications of Bayesian convolutional neural networks (BCNNs) for photo-z estimation and uncertainties. In addition, we use conformal mapping to calibrate the photo-z uncertainties to achieve good statistical coverage. We use the public GalaxiesML data set of ∼300k galaxies from the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey containing five-band photometric images and known spectroscopic redshifts from 0 < z < 4. We find that the performance is much improved when using images compared to photometry, with the BCNN achieving 0.098 rms error, a standard outlier rate of 3.9%, a 3σ outlier rate of 4.5%, and a bias of 0.0007. The performance drops significantly beyond z > 1.5 due to the relative lack of training data beyond those redshifts. This investigation demonstrates the power of using images directly and we advocate that future photo-z analysis of large-scale surveys include galaxy images.

J1543−0757是一个具有两个紧密排列的超大质量黑洞系统的星系。这一发现基于对其进行的多频观测，并揭示了星系中两个紧凑的、变化的、平坦光谱、活跃的核。这些观测还提供了关于所有成分的谱指数和 proper motion 的约束。这两个核的平坦光谱强烈支持它们与两个独立的、正在吸积的超大质量黑洞有关联。两个核似乎固定不动，而从较弱的核发出的喷流似乎移动并终止在明亮的热点上。这一发现对可能成为引力辐射源的紧密双黑洞的数量有着重要的意义。<br /><br />总结: J1543−0757是一个双超大质量黑洞系统，通过多频观测发现了两个活跃的核，并提供了有关它们平坦光谱和 proper motion 的约束。这对于我们了解黑洞系统的数量和引力辐射源是具有重要意义的。 <div>
We report on the discovery of a dual supermassive black hole system in the radio galaxy J1543−0757, with a projected separation between the two black holes of ∼46 mas. The result is based on recent multifrequency observations using the Very Long Baseline Array and European VLBI Network, which reveal two compact, variable, flat-spectrum, active nuclei within the elliptical host galaxy of J1543−0757. Multiepoch observations from the Very Long Baseline Array also provide constraints on the spectral index and proper motions of all components. The flat spectra of both N and S at both frequencies strongly support the hypothesis that these radio components are associated with two separate, accreting supermassive black holes. The two nuclei appear stationary, while the jets emanating from the weaker of the two nuclei appear to move out and terminate in bright hotspots. The discovery of this system has implications for the number of close dual black holes that might be sources of gravitational radiation.

<title>Mapping the Longitudinal Magnetic Field in the Atmosphere of an Active Region Plage from the Inversion of the Near-ultraviolet CLASP2.1 Spectropolarimetric Data</title>

We apply the HanleRT Tenerife Inversion Code to the spectropolarimetric observations obtained by the Chromospheric Layer Spectropolarimeter. This suborbital space experiment measured the variation with wavelength of the four Stokes parameters in the near-ultraviolet spectral region of the Mg ii h and k lines over a solar disk area containing part of an active region plage and the edge of a sunspot penumbra. We infer the stratification of the temperature, the electron density, the line-of-sight velocity, the microturbulent velocity, and the longitudinal component of the magnetic field from the observed intensity and circular polarization profiles. The inferred model atmosphere shows larger temperature and electron density in the plage and the superpenumbra regions than in the quiet regions. The shape of the plage region in terms of its brightness is similar to the pattern of the inferred longitudinal component of the magnetic field in the chromosphere, as well as to that of the overlying moss observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly in the 171 Å band, which suggests a similar magnetic origin for the heating in both the plage and the moss region. Moreover, this heating is particularly significant in the regions with larger inferred magnetic flux. In contrast, in the superpenumbra, the regions with larger electron density and temperature are usually found in between these regions with larger magnetic flux, suggesting that the details of the heating mechanism in the chromosphere of the superpenumbra may be different from those in the plage, but with the magnetic field still playing a key role.

<title>Prior-informed Active Galactic Nucleus Host Spectral Decomposition Using PyQSOFit</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We introduce an improved method for decomposing the emission of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their host galaxies using templates from principal component analysis (PCA). This approach integrates prior information from PCA with a penalized pixel fitting mechanism that improves the precision and effectiveness of the decomposition process. Specifically, we have reduced the degeneracy and overfitting in AGN host decomposition, particularly for those with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), where traditional methods tend to fail. By applying our method to 76,565 Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 16 quasars with z < 0.8, we achieve a success rate of ≈94%, thus establishing the largest host-decomposed spectral catalog of quasars to date. Our fitting results consider the impact of the host galaxy on the overestimation of the AGN luminosity and black hole mass (MBH). Furthermore, we obtained stellar velocity dispersion (σ⋆) measurements for 4137 quasars. The slope of the MBH−σ⋆ relation in this subsample is generally consistent with previous quasar studies beyond the local Universe. Our method provides a robust and efficient approach to disentangle the AGN and host galaxy components across a wide range of SNRs and redshifts.

<title>The Wanderer: Charting WASP-77A b’s Formation and Migration Using a System-wide Inventory of Carbon and Oxygen Abundances</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The elemental and isotopic abundances of volatiles like carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen may trace a planet’s formation location relative to H2O, CO2, CO, NH3, and N2 “snowlines,” or the distance from the star at which these volatile elements sublimate. By comparing the C/O and 12C/13C ratios measured in giant exoplanet atmospheres to complementary measurements of their host stars, we can determine whether the planet inherited stellar abundances from formation inside the volatile snowlines, or nonstellar C/O and 13C enrichment characteristic of formation beyond the snowlines. To date, there are still only a handful of exoplanet systems where we can make a direct comparison of elemental and isotopic CNO abundances between an exoplanet and its host star. Here, we present a 12C/13C abundance analysis for host star WASP-77A (whose hot Jupiter’s 12C/13C abundance was recently measured). We use MARCS stellar atmosphere models and the radiative transfer code TurboSpectrum to generate synthetic stellar spectra for isotopic abundance calculations. We find a 12C/13C ratio of 51 ± 6 for WASP-77A, which is subsolar (∼91) but may still indicate 13C enrichment in its companion planet WASP-77A b (12C/13C = 26 ± 16, previously reported). Together with the inventory of carbon and oxygen abundances in both the host and companion planet, these chemical constraints point to WASP-77A b’s formation beyond the H2O and CO2 snowlines and provide chemical evidence for the planet’s migration to its current location ∼0.024 au from its host star.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of SiO, SiS, H2O, NaCl, and SO line emission at ∼30–50 mas resolution. These images map the molecular outflow and disk of Orion Source I (SrcI) on ∼12–20 au scales. Our observations show that the flow of material around SrcI creates a turbulent boundary layer in the outflow from SrcI, which may dissipate angular momentum in the rotating molecular outflow into the surrounding medium. Additionally, the data suggest that the proper motion of SrcI may have a significant effect on the structure and evolution of SrcI and its molecular outflow. As the motion of SrcI funnels material between the disk and the outflow, some material may be entrained into the outflow and accrete onto the disk, creating shocks that excite the NaCl close to the disk surface.

<title>Late-time X-Ray Observations of the Jetted Tidal Disruption Event AT2022cmc: The Relativistic Jet Shuts Off</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2022cmc represents the fourth known example of a relativistic jet produced by the tidal disruption of a stray star, providing a unique probe of the formation and evolution of relativistic jets in otherwise dormant supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Here we present deep, late-time Chandra observations of AT2022cmc extending to tobs ≈ 400 days after disruption. Our observations reveal a sudden decrease in the X-ray brightness by a factor of ≳14 over a factor of ≈2.3 in time, and a deviation from the earlier power-law decline with a steepening α ≳ 3.2 (FX ∝ t−α), steeper than expected for a jet break, and pointing to the cessation of jet activity at tobs ≈ 215 days. Such a transition has been observed in two previous TDEs (Swift J1644+57 and Swift J2058+05). From the X-ray luminosity and the timescale of jet shut-off, we parameterize the mass of the SMBH in terms of unknown jet efficiency and accreted mass fraction parameters. Motivated by the disk–jet connection in active galactic nuclei, we favor black hole masses ≲105M⊙ (where the jet and disk luminosities are comparable), and disfavor larger black holes (in which extremely powerful jets are required to outshine their accretion disks). We additionally estimate a total accreted mass of ≈0.1 M⊙. Applying the same formalism to Swift J1644+57 and Swift J2058+05, we favor comparable black hole masses for these TDEs of ≲ a few × 105M⊙, and suggest that jetted TDEs may preferentially form from lower-mass black holes when compared to nonrelativistic events, owing to generally lower jet and higher disk efficiencies at higher black hole masses.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using stacked emission-line flux measurements of cool circumgalactic gas (CGM) in lower-mass galaxies (109.0 ≤ M*/M⊙ ≤ 1010.2), we measure the dependence of the emission characteristics on orientation relative to the disk plane as a function of radius and compare to what we found previously for massive (M* > 1010.4 M⊙) early-type galaxies. Although the line ratios (the lower [N ii]/Hα and [O iii]/Hβ) suggest an overall softer ionizing source than in the more massive galaxies, consistent with previous findings, we find the same ionization hardening signature (a higher [N ii]/Hα ratio in the inner polar region) along the polar direction at small radii that we found for the more massive galaxies. The line ratio in the inner polar bin is distinct from that measured for the inner planar bin with 99.99%, confidence and with >99.9% confidence we conclude that it lies outside the star formation regime. The effective hardening of the ionization of the CGM along the polar axis, at small radii, could indicate either relic effects of active galactic nucleus activity or shock ionization. In either case, this signature appears to be ubiquitous across the stellar mass range we are able to explore with our spectral stacking technique and currently available archival data.

Cosmic dawn represents a critical juncture in cosmic history when the first population of stars emerged. The astrophysical processes that govern this transformation need to be better understood. The detection of redshifted 21 cm radiation emitted from neutral hydrogen during this era offers a direct window into the thermal and ionization state of the Universe. This emission manifests as differential brightness between spin temperature and the cosmic microwave background. The SARAS experiment aims to detect the sky-averaged signal in the frequency range 40–200 MHz. SARAS’s unique design and operational strategy to float the antenna over a water body minimizes spectral features that may arise due to stratified ground beneath the antenna. However, the antenna environment can be prone to configuration changes due to variations in critical design parameters such as conductivity and antenna tilt. In this paper, we connect the variations in antenna properties to signal detection prospects. By using realistic simulations of a direction- and frequency-dependent radiation pattern of the SARAS antenna and its transfer function, we establish critical parameters and estimate bias in the detectability of different models of the global 21 cm signal. We find a correlation between the nature of chromaticity in antenna properties and the bias in the recovered spectral profiles of 21 cm signals. We also find stringent requirements for transfer function corrections, which can otherwise make detection prospects prohibitive. We finally explore a range of critical parameters that allow robust signal detection.

总结:
高质量星体形成通常发生在星团环境中，本文利用ALMA 1.33mm连续观测分析了30个高质量星体形成区域，利用树状图算法发现了573个核心，并发现了约5800天文单位的核心分离度。经过进一步分析，确定了约7000天文单位的特征碎裂尺度，与区域的热约恩长度相当。因此，热约恩碎裂在高质量星体形成区域中起着决定性的作用，而不需要调用湍流约恩碎裂。 <div>
Fragmentation contributes to the formation and evolution of stars. Observationally, high-mass stars are known to form multiple-star systems, preferentially in cluster environments. Theoretically, Jeans instability has been suggested to determine characteristic fragmentation scales, and thermal or turbulent motion in the parental gas clump mainly contributes to the instability. To search for such a characteristic fragmentation scale, we have analyzed Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.33 mm continuum observations toward 30 high-mass star-forming clumps taken by the Digging into the Interior of Hot Cores with ALMA survey. We have identified 573 cores using the dendrogram algorithm and measured the separation of cores by using the Minimum Spanning Tree technique. The core separation corrected by projection effects has a distribution peaked around 5800 au. In order to remove biases produced by different distances and sensitivities, we further smooth the images to a common physical scale and perform completeness tests. Our careful analysis finds a characteristic fragmentation scale of ∼7000 au, comparable to the thermal Jeans length of the clumps. We conclude that thermal Jeans fragmentation plays a dominant role in determining the clump fragmentation in high-mass star-forming regions, without the need to invoke turbulent Jeans fragmentation.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用JWST NIRCam广场无缝光谱仪，在ASPIRE项目的25个领域进行了系统的搜索，发现了16个红移为z≈4-5的广谱Hα发射线源。这些源的宽线部分的全宽半最大宽度为1000到3000km/s，暗示黑洞质量在10^7到10^8M⊙之间，同时暗示存在聚集现象。研究结果为高红移下的微弱AGN群体提供了宝贵的数据库。 <div>
Low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with low-mass black holes (BHs) in the early universe are fundamental to understanding the BH growth and their coevolution with the host galaxies. Utilizing JWST NIRCam Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy, we perform a systematic search for broad-line Hα emitters (BHAEs) at z ≈ 4–5 in 25 fields of the A SPectroscopic survey of biased halos In the Reionization Era (ASPIRE) project, covering a total area of 275 arcmin2. We identify 16 BHAEs with FWHM of the broad components spanning from ∼1000 to 3000 km s−1. Assuming that the broad line widths arise as a result of Doppler broadening around BHs, the implied BH masses range from 107 to 108M⊙, with broad Hα-converted bolometric luminosities of 1044.5–1045.5 erg s−1 and Eddington ratios of 0.07–0.47. The spatially extended structure of the F200W stacked image may trace the stellar light from the host galaxies. The Hα luminosity function indicates an increasing AGN fraction toward the higher Hα luminosities. We find possible evidence for clustering of BHAEs: two sources are at the same redshift with a projected separation of 519 kpc; one BHAE appears as a composite system residing in an overdense region with three close companion Hα emitters. Three BHAEs exhibit blueshifted absorption troughs indicative of the presence of high column density gas. We find that the broad-line-selected and photometrically selected BHAE samples exhibit different distributions in the optical continuum slopes, which can be attributed to their different selection methods. The ASPIRE broad-line Hα sample provides a good database for future studies of faint AGN populations at high redshift.

<br /><br />在这项研究中，研究人员通过STARFORGE项目的辐射-尘埃-磁流体动力学模拟对恒星形成分子云进行了研究。研究发现，一旦恒星超过一定的质量阈值（约2太阳质量），它们发出的辐射将清除其周围的尘埃颗粒，形成大约100天文单位大小的尘埃抑制区。这种尘埃的清除改变了该区域的气体性质，并且导致了恒星和其周围盘的降尘对气比（ADG）质量比的质量依赖性减少。研究预测，质量较大的恒星（≳10太阳质量）的ADG比将比其云的约低一个数量级。因此，恒星、其盘和周围环境将显示出与尘埃颗粒相关的元素（如碳和氧）的显著差异。 
<br /><br />总结: 这项研究通过模拟恒星形成过程中尘埃颗粒的动力学行为，发现随着恒星质量的增加，辐射会导致恒星周围形成尘埃抑制区，改变气体性质，影响恒星和其周围环境的尘埃对气比。对于质量较大的恒星，这种影响将导致其周围环境中常见尘埃颗粒相关元素的丰度显著减少。 <div>
Stars form within dense cores composed of both gas and dust within molecular clouds. However, despite the crucial role that dust plays in the star formation process, its dynamics is frequently overlooked, with the common assumption being a constant, spatially uniform dust-to-gas ratio and grain size spectrum. In this study, we introduce a set of radiation-dust-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of star-forming molecular clouds from the STARFORGE project. These simulations expand upon the earlier radiation MHD models, which included cooling, individual star formation, and feedback. Notably, they explicitly address the dynamics of dust grains, considering radiation, drag, and Lorentz forces acting on a diverse size spectrum of live dust grains. We find that once stars exceed a certain mass threshold (∼2 M⊙), their emitted radiation can evacuate dust grains from their vicinity, giving rise to a dust-suppressed zone of size ∼100 au. This removal of dust, which interacts with gas through cooling, chemistry, drag, and radiative transfer, alters the gas properties in the region. Commencing during the early accretion stages and preceding the main-sequence phase, this process results in a mass-dependent depletion in the accreted dust-to-gas (ADG) mass ratio within both the circumstellar disk and the star. We predict that massive stars (≳10 M⊙) would exhibit ADG ratios that are approximately 1 order of magnitude lower than that of their parent clouds. Consequently, stars, their disks, and circumstellar environments would display notable deviations in the abundances of elements commonly associated with dust grains, such as carbon and oxygen.

We present a spatially resolved study of stellar populations in six galaxies with stellar masses M* ∼ 1010M☉ at z ∼ 3.7 using 14-filter James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRCam imaging from the JADES and JEMS surveys. The six galaxies are visually selected to have clumpy substructures with distinct colors over rest frame 3600−4100 Å, including a red, dominant stellar core that is close to their stellar-light centroids. With 23-filter photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope to JWST, we measure the stellar-population properties of individual structural components via spectral energy distribution fitting using Prospector. We find that the central stellar cores are ≳2 times more massive than the Toomre mass, indicating they may not form via single in situ fragmentation. The stellar cores have stellar ages of 0.4−0.7 Gyr that are similar to the timescale of clump inward migration due to dynamical friction, suggesting that they likely instead formed through the coalescence of giant stellar clumps. While they have not yet quenched, the six galaxies are below the star-forming main sequence by 0.2−0.7 dex. Within each galaxy, we find that the specific star formation rate is lower in the central stellar core, and the stellar-mass surface density of the core is already similar to quenched galaxies of the same masses and redshifts. Meanwhile, the stellar ages of the cores are either comparable to or younger than the extended, smooth parts of the galaxies. Our findings are consistent with model predictions of the gas-rich compaction scenario for the buildup of galaxies’ central regions at high redshifts. We are likely witnessing the coeval formation of dense central cores, along with the onset of galaxy-wide quenching at z > 3.

<title>Atmospheric Response for MeV γ Rays Observed with Balloon-borne Detectors</title>

<div> 光子，γ射线，大气响应，散射，能谱畸变
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了MeV γ射线在大气中的响应特征。观察到两种组分，一种是未经散射达到探测器的光子，另一种是经过一次或多次散射后达到探测器的光子。散射组分对于所测光谱造成了显著的能量相关畸变，尤其是在观测巴龙载荷时需要重点考虑。文章通过模拟大气中γ射线传输的完整响应发现，散射组分在更低能量下变得越来越显著，在0.1 MeV时，可能会使测量通量增加约2-4倍，取决于光子指数和源的离轴角度。这对于扩散源特别重要，而对于用成像望远镜观测的点源，散射效应可能大大降低。 <div>
The atmospheric response for MeV γ rays (∼0.1–10 MeV) can be characterized in terms of two observed components. The first component is due to photons that reach the detector without scattering. The second component is due to photons that reach the detector after scattering one or more times. While the former can be determined in a straightforward manner, the latter is much more complex to quantify, as it requires tracking the transport of all source photons that are incident on Earth’s atmosphere. The scattered component can cause a significant energy-dependent distortion in the measured spectrum, which is important to account for when making balloon-borne observations. In this work, we simulate the full response for γ-ray transport in the atmosphere. We find that the scattered component becomes increasingly more significant toward lower energies, and at 0.1 MeV, it may increase the measured flux by as much as a factor of ∼2–4, depending on the photon index and off-axis angle of the source. This is particularly important for diffuse sources, whereas the effect from scattering can be significantly reduced for point sources observed with an imaging telescope.

<div> Hubble Space Telescope, quiescent galaxy, spectroscopic confirmation, low star formation rate, dust attenuation
<br />总结:
该研究报告了一项UNCOVER调查中的一项工作，对一颗红移为3.97的巨大宁静星系进行了光谱确认。尽管存在中等尘埃衰减的证据，深度观测在Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array中发现该星系与低（<10 M⊙ yr−1 ）星形成率（SFR）一致。研究对星系进行了详细的成分分析，发现其内部区域明显偏红，在不同区域的颜色具有强烈的梯度。通过空间分辨率的质量与光度测量，并结合最佳的双组分Sérsic模型，研究人员推断出了该星系的总质量和星际物质比。研究结果表明，这颗星系早期形成了一个密集的、低星形成率的尘埃核心，这对我们对早期结构演化的理解有着重要的启示。另外，全局、整合的尘埃特性与空间梯度的不一致也彰显了在描述星系早期生长过程时，考虑径向变化的恒星种群结构的重要性。 <div>
We report the spectroscopic confirmation of a massive ( ), Hubble Space Telescope–dark (mF150W − mF444W = 3.6) quiescent galaxy at zspec = 3.97 in the UNCOVER survey. NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy and a nondetection in deep Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array imaging surprisingly reveals that the galaxy is consistent with a low (<10 M⊙ yr−1) star formation rate (SFR) despite evidence for moderate dust attenuation. The F444W image is well modeled with a two-component Sérsic fit that favors a compact, re ∼ 200 pc, n ∼ 2.9 component and a more extended, re ∼ 1.6 kpc, n ∼ 1.7 component. The galaxy exhibits strong color gradients: the inner regions are significantly redder than the outskirts. Spectral energy distribution models that reproduce both the red colors and low SFR in the center of UNCOVER 18407 require both significant (Av ∼ 1.4 mag) dust attenuation and a stellar mass-weighted age of 900 Myr, implying 50% of the stars in the core already formed by z = 7.5. Using spatially resolved annular mass-to-light measurements enabled by the galaxy’s moderate magnification ( ) to reconstruct a radial mass profile from the best-fitting two-component Sérsic model, we infer a total mass-weighted kpc and log . The early formation of a dense, low SFR, and dusty core embedded in a less attenuated stellar envelope suggests an evolutionary link between the earliest-forming massive galaxies and their elliptical descendants. Furthermore, the disparity between the global, integrated dust properties and the spatially resolved gradients highlights the importance of accounting for radially varying stellar populations when characterizing the early growth of galaxy structure.

<div> 关键词: 模拟, Wolf–Rayet 星, 银河中心, X 射线光谱, 超大质量黑洞
总结: 本研究使用了流体动力学模拟研究了银河系中心的Wolf-Rayet星的恒星风，预测了超大质量黑洞Sgr A*的X射线光谱。结果表明，在Sgr A*周围形成了一个"冷"（104K）的气体盘，这与先前的网格模拟一致。我们通过产生合成光谱来比较冷盘环境的等离子体场景与没有冷盘环境的情况，并发现目前和未来的X射线任务不太可能区分这两种场景中等离子体的动力学特征。我们的模型与Chandra HETGS获得的Sgr A*光谱相匹配。最后，我们发现射电效率低的吸积流模型和流体动力学模拟的模型并没有强烈的偏好。新的X射线任务将提供更清晰的区分，但只有角秒分辨率的未来X射线任务才能在X射线领域显著推进我们对Sgr A*吸积流的理解。 <div>
Hydrodynamic simulations of the stellar winds from Wolf–Rayet stars within the Galactic center can provide predictions for the X-ray spectrum of the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. Herein, we present results from updated smooth particle hydrodynamics simulations, building on the architecture of Cuadra et al. and Russell et al., and find that a “cold” (104 K) gas disk forms around Sgr A* with a simulation runtime of 3500 yr. This result is consistent with previous grid-based simulations, demonstrating that a cold disk can form regardless of numerical method. We examine the plasma scenarios arising from an environment with and without this cold disk, by generating synthetic spectra for comparison to the quiescent Fe Kα Sgr A* spectrum from Chandra HETGS, taken through the Chandra X-ray Visionary Program. We find that current and future X-ray missions are unlikely to distinguish between the kinematic signatures in the plasma in these two scenarios. Nonetheless, the stellar wind plasma model presents a good fit to the dispersed Chandra spectra within 1.″5 of Sgr A*. We compare our results to the radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) model fit to the HETGS spectrum presented in Paper I and find that the Bayesian model evidence does not strongly favor either model. With 9″ angular resolution and high spectral resolution of the X-IFU, NewAthena will offer a clearer differentiation between the RIAF plasma model and hydrodynamic simulations, but only a future X-ray mission with arcsecond resolution will significantly advance our understanding of Sgr A*’s accretion flow in X-rays.

<div> 关键词：Sgr A*，超大质量黑洞，辐射低效率的吸积流，Chandra HETG-S谱，RIAF模型

总结:<br /><br />本研究使用辐射低效率的吸积流（RIAF）模型对Chandra HETG-S谱进行分析，并考虑了吸积流几何形状和仪器效应。结果显示，谱线特征表明等温和速度结构存在于等离子体内。拟合高分辨率光栅谱表明，存在一个与流出平衡的流入（s∼1），并且温度分布比1/r的引力潜能预期的要平缓。数据要求铁的丰度相对太阳较低（ZFe < 0.32 Z⊙，90％的置信区间），远低于在附近晚型巨星中测量的2 Z⊙金属丰度。未来的任务将提供更高的谱分辨率，但源分离仍将是一个问题。利用Chandra无与伦比的空间分辨率进行详细的银河中心X射线的研究仍然至关重要。 <div>
The extreme low-luminosity supermassive black hole Sgr A* provides a unique laboratory in which to test models of radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs). Previous fits to the quiescent Chandra ACIS-S spectrum found that a RIAF model with an equal inflow–outflow balance works well. In this work, we apply the RIAF model to the Chandra HETG-S spectrum obtained through the Chandra X-ray Visionary Program, which displays features suggestive of temperature and velocity structures within the plasma. A comprehensive forward model analysis accounting for the accretion flow geometry and HETG-S instrumental effects is required for a full interpretation of the quiescent Chandra HETG-S spectrum. We present a RIAF model that takes these effects into account. Our fits to the high-resolution grating spectrum indicate an inflow balanced by an outflow (s ∼ 1) alongside a temperature profile that appears shallower than what would be expected from a gravitational potential following 1/r. The data require that the abundance of iron relative to solar is ZFe < 0.32 Z⊙ (90% credible interval), much lower than the 2 Z⊙ metallicity measured in nearby late-type giants. While future missions like NewAthena will provide higher spectral resolution, source separation will continue to be a problem. Leveraging Chandra’s unparalleled spatial resolution, which is not expected to be surpassed for decades, remains essential for detailed investigations of the densely populated Galactic center in X-rays.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究探讨了毫秒脉冲星在球状星团中的丰度和其光度函数的参数限制能力。我们引入了一种基于边际神经比估计的新型无似然分析方法，该方法能够一致地产生良好行为的后验概率。我们发现Terzan 5球状星团可能拥有158颗MSPs，但对这一数字的不确定性仍然很大。通过对模拟的Terzan 5样本数据进行分析，我们发现通过添加球状星团的弥散射电辐射的可靠测量或将当前无线电脉冲调查的检测阈值提高至少2倍，可以显著改善后验概率。 <div>
Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are abundant in globular clusters (GCs), which offer favorable environments for their creation. While the advent of recent, powerful facilities led to a rapid increase in MSP discoveries in GCs through pulsation searches, detection biases persist. In this work, we investigate the ability of current and future detections in GCs to constrain the parameters of the MSP population in GCs through a careful study of their luminosity function. Parameters of interest are the number of MSPs hosted by a GC, as well as the mean and the width of their luminosity function, which are typically affected by large uncertainties. While, as we show, likelihood-based studies can lead to ill-behaved posteriors on the size of the MSP population, we introduce a novel, likelihood-free analysis, based on marginal neural ratio estimation, which consistently produces well-behaved posteriors. We focus on the GC Terzan 5 (or Ter 5), which currently counts 48 detected MSPs. We find that 158 MSPs should be hosted in this GC, but the uncertainty on this number remains large. We explore the performance of our new method on simulated Terzan 5-like data sets mimicking possible future observational outcomes. We find that significant improvement on the posteriors can be obtained by adding a reliable measurement of the diffuse radio emission of the GC to the analysis or by improving the detection threshold of current radio pulsation surveys by at least a factor of 2.

<div> 关键词: CGM, 矮星系, 模拟, 摩擦剥离, 星际介质

总结: 本研究通过模拟探究了矮星系的CGM在类似银河系环境中对摩擦剥离的敏感程度。研究发现，矮星系的CGM在数百兆年内就有超过95%的质量被摩擦剥离，即使在弱摩擦剥离轨道上，ISM的剥离也是可忽略的。另外，发现加入卫星CGM并不会有效保护其星系，因此ISM的剥离速率不受影响。这些结果表明矮星系的CGM在卫星星系中难以被探测到，并且矮星系的星形成很可能不会得到CGM的补充。 <div>
The circumgalactic medium (CGM) of star-forming dwarf galaxies plays a key role in regulating the galactic baryonic cycle. We investigate how susceptible the CGM of dwarf satellite galaxies is to ram pressure stripping in Milky Way–like environments. In a suite of hydrodynamical wind tunnel simulations, we model an intermediate-mass dwarf satellite galaxy (M* = 107.2M⊙) with a multiphase interstellar medium (ISM; MISM = 107.9M⊙) and CGM (MCGM,vir = 108.5M⊙) along two first-infall orbits to more than 500 Myr past pericenter of a Milky Way–like host. The spatial resolution is ∼79 pc in the star-forming ISM and 316−632 pc in the CGM. Our simulations show that the dwarf satellite CGM removal is fast and effective: more than 95% of the CGM mass is ram pressure stripped within a few hundred megayears, even under a weak ram pressure orbit where the ISM stripping is negligible. The conditions for CGM survival are consistent with the analytical halo gas stripping predictions in McCarthy et al. We also find that including the satellite CGM does not effectively shield its galaxy, and therefore the ISM stripping rate is unaffected. Our results imply that a dwarf galaxy CGM is unlikely to be detected in satellite galaxies; and that the star formation of gaseous dwarf satellites is likely devoid of replenishment from a CGM.

MFs作为一种强大的拓扑摘要统计工具，对提取非高斯信息具有重要作用。研究发现，利用EOR阶段的21厘米亮度温度场的MFs，可以限制再电离参数。通过模拟电波干涉阵列实验，如HERA和SKA的观测，考虑包括热噪声、合成波束和前景回避在内的实际效应。研究表明，利用SKA-Low测量的21厘米信号的MFs可以区分不同的再电离模型，而使用类似HERA的阵列进行的MF测量无法准确进行。进一步预测了利用MFs测量可以限制再电离参数的精度，使用基于前向建模的参数推断的标准Markov Chain Monte Carlo分析。发现对于SKA-Low观测，MFs提供了与功率谱（PS）分析相当的再电离参数无偏估计的精度。此外，使用MFs和PS的联合约束可以提高约30%的约束精度，相比仅使用PS。然而，如果采用强前景回避缩小EOR窗口，约束精度可能会降低。我们的分析表明，MFs作为一组摘要统计量，从21厘米EOR场中提取出与双点统计不同的互补信息，因此有很大动力将MFs纳入未来21厘米观测的数据分析中。<br /><br />总结: MFs作为拓扑摘要统计工具，在21厘米再电离观测数据分析中具有重要潜力，可以提供与功率谱分析相当的再电离参数无偏估计的精度。同时，MFs与PS的联合约束可以提高约束精度，并在21厘米观测中提取出互补信息。 <div>
The Minkowski functionals (MFs), a set of topological summary statistics, have emerged as a powerful tool for extracting non-Gaussian information. We investigate the prospect of constraining the reionization parameters using the MFs of the 21 cm brightness temperature field from the epoch of reionization (EOR). Realistic effects, including thermal noise, synthesized beam, and foreground avoidance, are applied to the mock observations from radio interferometric array experiments such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). We demonstrate that the MFs of the 21 cm signal measured with SKA-Low can be used to distinguish different reionization models, whereas the MF measurement with a HERA-like array cannot be made accurately enough. We further forecast the accuracies with which the MF measurements can place constraints on reionization parameters, using the standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis for parameter inference based on forward modeling. We find that for SKA-Low observation, MFs provide unbiased estimations of the reionization parameters with accuracies comparable to the power spectrum (PS) analysis. Furthermore, joint constraints using both MFs and PS can improve the constraint accuracies by up to 30% compared to those with the PS alone. Nevertheless, the constraint accuracies can be degraded if the EOR window is shrunk with strong foreground avoidance. Our analysis demonstrates the promise of MFs as a set of summary statistics that extract complementary information from the 21 cm EOR field to the two-point statistics, which suggests a strong motivation for incorporating the MFs into the data analysis of future 21 cm observations.

本研究分析了2016年10月12日在L1拉格朗日点探测到的星际日冕物质喷发与高速流的相互作用。通过观测-建模相结合的方法，估计了相互作用发生/起始的星际空间区域。研究使用了多种分析方法，包括最小方差分析和Walen测试来研究可能出现在星际日冕物质喷发和高速流接触界面的重联耗散。同时，使用了逐步圆柱壳重建CME来估计日冕物质喷发的几何形状和源区位置。最后，使用了两步阻力模型来估计相互作用发生的星际空间区域。研究结果表明，星际实际观测显示出具有对称和未受扰动结构的磁障碍，并展现出典型星际日冕物质喷发的磁通量、螺旋度和膨胀速度特征。而最终的两步阻力模型结果表明，星际日冕物质喷发开始与高速流相互作用的地点接近地球（约0.81天文单位），与实际观测的推断相吻合。 <br /> <div>
We analyze the interaction between an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) detected in situ at the L1 Lagrange point on 2016 October 12 with a trailing high-speed stream (HSS). We aim to estimate the region in the interplanetary (IP) space where the interaction happened/started using a combined observational-modeling approach. We use minimum variance analysis (MVA) and the Walen test to analyze possible reconnection exhaust at the interface of ICME and HSS. We perform a graduated cylindrical shell reconstruction of the CME to estimate the geometry and source location of the CME. Finally, we use a two-step drag-based model (DBM) model to estimate the region in IP space where the interaction took place. The magnetic obstacle observed in situ shows a fairly symmetric and undisturbed structure and shows the magnetic flux, helicity, and expansion profile/speed of a typical ICME. The MVA together with the Walen test, however, confirms reconnection exhaust at the ICME–HSS boundary. Thus, in situ signatures are in favor of a scenario where the interaction is fairly recent. The trailing HSS shows a distinct velocity profile which first reaches a semi-saturated plateau with an average velocity of 500 km s−1 and then saturates at a maximum speed of 710 km s−1. We find that the HSS's interaction with the ICME is influenced only by this initial plateau. The results of the two-step DBM suggest that the ICME has started interacting with the HSS close to Earth (∼0.81 au), which compares well with the deductions from in situ signatures.

Interpretation of the ongoing efforts to simulate the atmospheres of potentially habitable terrestrial exoplanets requires that we understand the underlying dynamics and chemistry of such objects to a much greater degree than 1D or even simple 3D models enable. Here, for the tidally locked habitable-zone planet TRAPPIST-1e, we explore one effect which can shape the dynamics and chemistry of terrestrial planets: the inclusion of an Earth-like land–ocean distribution with orography. To do this we use the Earth-system model WACCM6/CESM2 to run a pair of TRAPPIST-1e models with N2–O2 atmospheres and with the substellar point fixed over either land or ocean. The presence of orography shapes atmospheric transport, and in the case of Earth-like orography, breaks the symmetry between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres which was previously found in slab ocean models. For example, peak zonal jet speeds in the Southern Hemisphere are 50%–100% faster than similar jets in the Northern Hemisphere. This also affects the meridional circulation, transporting equatorial material toward the south pole. As a result we also find significant changes in the atmospheric chemistry, including the accumulation of potentially lethal quantities of ozone at both the south pole and the surface. Future studies which investigate the effects of landmass distribution on the dynamics of exoplanetary atmospheres should pay close attention to both the dayside land fraction as well as the orography of the land. Simply modeling a flat landmass will not give a complete picture of its dynamical impact.

Intrinsic colors (ICs) of stars are essential for studies on both stellar physics and dust reddening. In this work, we developed an XGBoost model to predict ICs with the atmospheric parameters Teff, , and [M/H]. The model was trained and tested for three colors at Gaia and Two Micron All Sky Survey bands with 1,040,446 low-reddening sources. The atmospheric parameters were determined by the Gaia DR3 General Stellar Parameterizer from Photometry (GSP-phot) module and were validated by comparing with the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment and Large Sky Area Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope. We further confirmed that the biases in GSP-phot parameters, especially for [M/H], do not present a significant impact on the IC prediction. The generalization error of the model estimated by the test set is 0.014 mag for , 0.050 mag for , and 0.040 mag for . The model was applied to a sample containing 5,714,528 reddened stars with stellar parameters from R. Andrae et al. to calculate ICs and reddenings. The high consistency in the comparison of E(J − KS) between our results and literature values further validates the accuracy of the XGBoost model. The variation of E(GBP − KS)/E(GBP − GRP), a representation of the extinction law, with Galactic longitude is found on large scales. This work preliminarily presents the feasibility and accuracy of the machine learning approach for IC and dust reddening calculation, whose products could be widely applied to spectrophotometric data. The data sets and trained model can be accessed via Zenodo, doi:10.5281/zenodo.12787594. Models for more bands will be completed in following work.

<div> NGC 4278, LINER, γ-ray source, Swift-XRT, spectral energy distribution
<br /><br />
NGC 4278是一个低光度活动星系核，通常被归类为低电离核发射线区(LINER)。最近，有报道称它与首个大型高海拔空气淋浴观测站(LHAASO)源目录中的一个很高能的γ射线源1LHAASO J1219+2915相关。然而，通过分析费米伽马射线空间望远镜(LAT)的数据，没有检测到相关联的对应物。通过分析Swift-XRT的X射线观测数据，我们发现NGC 4278在MJD 59546时处于高通量状态，X射线通量比大约11.7年前的Chandra观测结果高出一个数量级。有趣的是，这个Swift-XRT观测是在γ射线源1LHAASO J1219+2915的活跃阶段进行的。我们提出，NGC 4278的高能γ射线的检测可能归因于其中心活动核的存在。为了再现NGC 4278的光谱能量分布(SED)，我们采用了一个单区域的轻子模型，通常用于拟合BL Lac的宽频谱SED，并发现所需的磁场强度比典型TeV BL Lac要小。此外，与典型TeV BL Lac相比，NGC 4278在无线电和TeV波段表现出显著较低的亮度。在无线电亮度与艾丁顿比平面上，NGC 4278显示出与Seyfert星系和LINERs更相似，而不是BL Lac，然而，它仍然大致跟随BL Lac在较低亮度方向的延伸。 
<br /><br />总结: 
1. NGC 4278被归类为低光度活动星系核(LINER)；
2. 与γ射线源1LHAASO J1219+2915相关，但费米望远镜未检测到对应物；
3. Swift-XRT观测显示NGC 4278处于高通量状态；
4. 提出NGC 4278的高能γ射线检测可能与活动核有关；
5. 采用轻子模型再现NGC 4278的光谱能量分布，磁场强度较小。 <div>
NGC 4278, a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus, is generally classified as a low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER). Recently, it has been reported to be associated with a very high energy γ-ray source 1LHAASO J1219+2915 in the first Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory source catalog. However, no associated counterpart has been detected by analyzing the data collected by the Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. By analyzing its X-ray observation data from Swift-XRT, we find that NGC 4278 is in a high-flux state on MJD 59546, with the X-ray flux more than one order of magnitude higher than that observed ∼11.7 yr earlier by Chandra. Interestingly, this Swift-XRT observation was conducted during the active phase of the γ-ray source 1LHAASO J1219+2915. We propose that the detection of very high energy γ-rays from NGC 4278 may be attributed to the presence of an active nucleus in its center. To reproduce the spectral energy distribution (SED) of NGC 4278, we employ a one-zone leptonic model, typically used for fitting broadband SEDs of BL Lacs, and find that a smaller magnetic field strength is required than that of typical TeV BL Lacs. Furthermore, NGC 4278 exhibits significantly lower luminosity in both radio and TeV bands when compared with typical TeV BL Lacs. In the radio luminosity versus Eddington ratio plane, NGC 4278 shows greater similarity to Seyfert galaxies and LINERs than to BL Lacs; however, it still roughly follows the extension toward lower luminosity seen in BL Lacs.

这篇文章讨论了短暂持续的伽玛射线暴GRB 201006A产生的一次相干射电闪焰，研究认为射电闪焰可能源自超质量磁星坍缩成黑洞的过程，该磁星的表面磁场和初始自转周期落在合理范围内。作者还观察到了不符合预期的光学数据，认为这与GRB 201006A相关的铀新星辐射未被探测到。总体来说，文章认为GRB 201006A的射电闪焰、光谱能量关联和光学观测数据支持了紧凑星的合并模型。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
Recently, the detection of a coherent radio flash associated with short-duration GRB 201006A, occurring 76.6 minutes after the burst, has attracted great attention. However, the physical origin of the coherent radio flash remains under debate. By reanalyzing its data observed by Fermi and Swift, we find that an early radio afterglow as the physical origin of the radio flash can be ruled out, but the coherent radio emission seems to be consistent with the hypothesis of a supramassive magnetar as the central engine collapsing into a black hole. Within this scenario, the derived magnetar surface magnetic field (Bp) and the initial spin period (P0) fall into a reasonable range but require a preferably low value of ηR = 10−7 or 10−6. Moreover, the calculated low-ε value and Eγ,iso–Ep correlation of GRB 201006A also supports the progenitor which is from the merger of compact stars. We also discuss the non-detected kilonova emission associated with GRB 201006A, and then compare with its upper limits of optical observations.

总结: 本文利用TESS光度测量数据对矮新星HS 2325+8205中的倾斜盘旋转和阴性超级高峰进行了综合研究。发现了0.185671日的阴性超级高峰，并观察到这一频率和倾斜盘旋转周期3.943日以及4.135日周期的星食最小值的周期性变化。此外，还发现了星食深度和NSH振幅的双周期变化（P1 = 4.131日和P2 = 2.065日），并发现NSH振幅和星食深度随NSH频率的增加而减小，而NSH振幅与星食深度正相关。这些复杂的变化为理解倾斜盘旋转和阴性超级高峰提供了充分的证据。<br /><br /> <div>
Tilted disk precession exists in different objects. Negative superhumps (NSHs) in cataclysmic variable stars are believed to arise from the interaction between the reverse precession of a tilted disk and the streams from the secondary star. Utilizing Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite photometry, we present a comprehensive investigation into the tilted disk precession and NSHs in the dwarf nova (DN) HS 2325+8205, employing eclipse minima, eclipse depths, NSH frequencies, and NSH amplitudes and the correlation between them as the windows. We identified NSHs with a period of 0.185671(17) day in HS 2325+8205. The NSH frequency exhibits variability with a period of 3.943(9) days, akin to the tilted disk precession period validated in nova-like stars (SDSS J0812) and intermediate polars (IPs; TV Col). The O − C of the eclipse minima were similarly found to vary cyclically in a period of 4.135(5) days, characterized by a faster rise than fall. Furthermore, the NSH amplitude exhibits complex and diverse variations, which may be linked to changes in the disk radius, the mass transfer rate, and the apparent area of the hot spot. For the first time in DNe, we observe biperiodic variations in eclipse depth (P1 = 4.131(4) days and P2 = 2.065(2) days ≈ Pprec/2) resembling those seen in IPs, suggesting that variations with P2 are not attributable to an accretion curtain, as previously suspected. Moreover, NSH amplitude and eclipse depth decrease with increasing NSH frequency, while NSH amplitude correlates positively with eclipse depth. These complex variations observed across multiple observational windows provide substantial evidence for the understanding of tilted disk precession and NSHs.

<br />总结:<br />本文使用了机器学习方法来评估新数据对太阳耀斑后SEP事件的预测潜力。研究发现尽管数据量增加，预测精度仍未超过之前的基准，但模拟实际操作环境的线性支持向量机模型显示对SEP事件的预测精度略有提高。这表明需要更复杂、物理知识驱动的模型以更好地理解导致SEP事件的基本过程。 <div>
The prediction of solar energetic particle (SEP) events garners increasing interest as space missions extend beyond Earth’s protective magnetosphere. These events, which are, in most cases, products of magnetic-reconnection-driven processes during solar flares or fast coronal-mass-ejection-driven shock waves, pose significant radiation hazards to aviation, space-based electronics, and particularly space exploration. In this work, we utilize the recently developed data set that combines the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Space-weather Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager Active Region Patches and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Space-weather Michelson Doppler Imager Active Region Patches. We employ a suite of machine learning strategies, including support vector machines (SVMs) and regression models, to evaluate the predictive potential of this new data product for a forecast of post-solar flare SEP events. Our study indicates that despite the augmented volume of data, the prediction accuracy reaches 0.7 ± 0.1 (experimental setting), which aligns with but does not exceed these published benchmarks. A linear SVM model with training and testing configurations that mimic an operational setting (positive–negative imbalance) reveals a slight increase (+0.04 ± 0.05) in the accuracy of a 14 hr SEP forecast compared to previous studies. This outcome emphasizes the imperative for more sophisticated, physics-informed models to better understand the underlying processes leading to SEP events.

<div> 超轨道信号, 临近光度分析, 断断续续的超表面信号, 周期振荡, 出现幅度的变化
<br />
总结:<br />
这篇文章报道了对EX Dra的光度研究发现。数据显示了20次完整的爆发，表现出几个有趣且罕见的特征。光度曲线展现出一个明显的超轨道信号，周期约为4.39天，以及一个负的超脉冲，周期约为4.805小时，表明了凝聚盘的倾斜和进动。此外，超轨道周期的时变特性表明了进动周期的波动。在平静期的掩星光度极小值O-C分析显示了一个周期为3.9天的振荡，略短于超轨道周期。我们认为这不太可能是轨道周期的突然改变，而更可能受到了凝聚盘的倾斜和进动的影响。值得注意的是，我们发现了从每隔26天出现一次幅度为3.5等的爆发行为，转变为幅度大约为2.5等、周期大约为12天的行为，这种行为持续了14年才恢复。此外，在非遮蔽相位的平台上提取出了在37至40分钟之间的准周期振荡。 <div>
We present a photometric study of EX Dra, a dwarf nova that has been extensively observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. The data reveal the occurrence of 20 complete outbursts, exhibiting several intriguing and rare characteristics. The light curves exhibit a distinct superorbital signal with a period of approximately Psor ∼ 4.39(7) days, along with a negative superhump showing an approximate period of Pnsh ∼ 4.805(1) hr, indicating that the accretion disk is tilted and undergoing precession with the period of Psor. In addition, the time-varying nature of Psor suggests that the precession period is fluctuating.The eclipsing light minima O – C analysis during quiescence shows an oscillation with period of 3.9(5) days, which is a little shorter than the superorbital period. We contend that this is unlikely to be a sudden alteration of the orbital period, but rather, it is influenced by the tilt and precession of the accretion disk. Notably, we found an amplitude shift in the outburst behavior from 3.5 mag with a periodicity of about 26 days to an amplitude of around 2.5 mag with a periodicity of about 12 days, which persisted for 14 yr before reverting. Furthermore, we have extracted quasiperiodic oscillations in the plateau at the noneclipsed phases, characterized by periods ranging between 37 and 40 minutes.

In recent years, the continued detection of complex organic molecules of prebiotic interest has refueled the interest in a panspermic origin of life. The prebiotic molecule glyceraldehyde is proposed to be formed from (Z)-1,2-ethenediol, a molecule recently detected toward the G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud at the galactic center. In this work, we computationally simulate the formation of (Z)-1,2-ethenediol from vinyl alcohol on the surface of amorphous solid water in a two-step synthesis involving an OH addition and an H abstraction reaction. In total, we considered all reaction possibilities of the 1,1- and 1,2-OH addition to vinyl alcohol followed by H abstraction or H addition reactions on the resulting radicals. The combination of these reactions is capable of explaining the formation of (Z)-1,2-ethenediol provided a suprathermal diffusion of OH. We also conclude that our proposed formation pathway is not selective and also yields other abstraction and addition products. Key in our findings is the connection between the adsorption modes of the reactants and intermediates and the stereoselectivity of the reactions.

在本研究中，研究人员构建了一个半解析模型，估算了再电离对超大质量黑洞生长的影响。他们发现，在质量为1012、1011、1010 M⊙的暗物质暗云内，早期的再电离可以使超大质量黑洞的质量在z = 6时减少50%至90%。此外，他们的研究还表明，再电离的影响程度取决于Eddington accretion rate是否可以超过，如果可以，那么超大质量黑洞的质量主要在早期再电离阶段(z≳10)被抑制，否则则在整个红移范围内受抑制。最后，研究发现，全球平均再电离可能会使1011 M⊙以下的暗物质暗云内的超大质量黑洞质量减少至少两倍。未来JWST发现的超大质量黑洞普查结果可能可以验证更质量的超大质量黑洞更可能存在于后期再电离的宇宙体积中的基本预测。
<br /><br />总结: <div>
The supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that power active galactic nuclei found at z ≥ 6 were formed during the Epoch of Reionization. Because reionization is an inhomogeneous process, the physical properties of SMBH host-galaxy environments will vary spatially during reionization. We construct a semi-analytic model to estimate the impact of reionization on SMBH growth. Using a series of merger trees, reionization models, and black hole (BH) growth models, we find that early reionization can reduce a SMBH’s mass by up to [50, 70, 90]% within dark matter halos of mass [1012, 1011, 1010] M⊙ by z = 6. Our findings also suggest that the redshift range in which BH growth is impacted by reionization strongly depends on whether the Eddington accretion rate can be exceeded. If so, we find that BH masses are significantly suppressed principally during the early phases of reionization (z ≳ 10), while they are more readily suppressed across the full redshift range if super-Eddington growth is not allowed. We find that the global average impact of reionization may be to reduce the masses of BHs residing in ≲1011M⊙ halos by a factor of ≳2. The census of SMBHs being uncovered by the JWST may offer a means to test the basic prediction that more massive BHs reside in cosmological volumes that are reionized at later times.

<br /><br />总结:
研究利用詹姆斯·韦伯空间望远镜中红外仪器的中分辨率光谱仪观测了UGC 8782的射电活跃星系核宿主，以绘制温暖的分子和电离气体动力学。数据显示在内部2千秒差距内存在空间分辨的流出现象，低电离（由[Ar ii] 6.99 μm发射跟踪）和温暖的分子气体（由H2旋转跃迁跟踪）均可见。我们发现温暖流（198K ≤ T ≤ 1000K）在距离核心约900pc处的最大流出率为4.90 ± 2.04 M⊙ yr−1，并估计更热的气体相（T > 1000 K）的流出率高达1.22 ± 0.51 M⊙ yr−1。这些流出可以在约1百万年内清除整个核心温暖分子气体。所得分子流出动能导致与AGN光度的耦合效率为2%–5%，远高于AGN反馈在扼制恒星形成中至少预期的最低值。 <div>
We use the James Webb Space Telescope Mid-Infrared Instrument medium-resolution spectrometer observations of the radio-loud active galactic nucleus (AGN) host UGC 8782 to map the warm molecular and ionized gas kinematics. The data reveal spatially resolved outflows in the inner 2 kpc, seen in low ionization (traced by the [Ar ii] 6.99 μm emission) and in warm molecular gas (traced by the H2 rotational transitions). We find a maximum mass-outflow rate of 4.90 ± 2.04 M⊙ yr−1 at ∼900 pc from the nucleus for the warm outflow (198 K ≤ T ≤ 1000 K) and estimate an outflow rate of up to 1.22 ± 0.51 M⊙ yr−1 for the hotter gas phase (T > 1000 K). These outflows can clear the entire nuclear reservoir of warm molecular gas in about 1 Myr. The derived kinetic power of the molecular outflows leads to coupling efficiencies of 2%–5% of the AGN luminosity, way above the minimum expected for the AGN feedback to be effective in quenching the star formation.

The statistical analysis of cosmic large-scale structure is most often based on simple two-point summary statistics, like the power spectrum or the two-point correlation function of a sample of galaxies or other types of tracers. In contrast, topological measures of clustering are also sensitive to higher-order correlations and thus offer the prospect to access additional information that may harbor important constraining power. We here revisit one such geometric measure of the cosmic web in the form of the so-called percolation analysis, using the recent MillenniumTNG simulation suite of the ΛCDM paradigm. We analyze continuum percolation statistics both for high-resolution dark matter particle distributions and for galaxy mock catalogs from a semianalytic galaxy formation model within a periodic simulation volume of 3000 Mpc on a side. For comparison, we also investigate the percolation statistics of random particle sets and neutrino distributions with two different summed particle masses. We find that the percolation statistics of the dark matter distribution evolves strongly with redshift and thus clustering strength, yielding a progressively lower percolation threshold toward later times. However, there is a sizable residual dependence on numerical resolution, which we interpret as a residual influence of different levels of shot noise. This is corroborated by our analysis of galaxy mock catalogs, whose results depend on sampling density more strongly than on galaxy selection criteria. While this limits the discriminative power of percolation statistics, our results suggest that it still remains useful as a complementary cosmological test when controlled for sampling density.

<br />总结:
磁星爆发受到强烈磁场的驱动。最近，这一现象引起了人们的广泛关注，因为据报道与一些快速射电暴有关。了解磁星爆发可能揭示了神秘的瞬变事件的关键。地壳由于磁场演化而产生的弹性变形会在长时间尺度上累积。最终，地壳会在特定阈值之上断裂或产生塑性变形。确定临界限制是需要获得对磁应力响应中的剪应变张量的理解。在一些研究中，这个张量被一个从磁应力代数确定的近似表达式所取代。这项研究通过将其与适当计算得出的应变张量进行比较来评估该近似的有效性。通过求解由磁场驱动的弹性变形的微分方程，结果表明该近似并未准确表示应变张量的数值和空间分布。以往基于虚假标准的演化计算可能会高估应变张量的大小，并且地壳断裂会在较短时间尺度上发生。因此，有必要通过使用正确的方法重新审视演化计算。这项研究对于发展磁星地壳断裂和磁场演化的动力学非常重要。 <div>
Magnetar outbursts are powered by an intense magnetic field. The phenomenon has recently drawn significant attention because of a connection to some fast radio bursts that has been reported. Understanding magnetar outbursts may provide the key to mysterious transient events. The elastic deformation of the solid crust due to magnetic field evolution accumulates over a secular timescale. Eventually, the crust fractures or responds plastically beyond a particular threshold. Determination of the critical limit is required to obtain the shear strain tensor in response to magnetic stress. In some studies, the tensor was substituted with an approximate expression determined algebraically from the magnetic stress. This study evaluated the validity of the approximation by comparing it with the strain tensor obtained through appropriate calculations. The differential equations for the elastic deformation driven by the magnetic field were solved. The results indicated that the approximation did not represent the correct strain tensor value, in both magnitude and spatial profile. Previous evolutionary calculations based on spurious criteria are likely to overestimate the magnitude of the strain tensor, and crustal failure occurs on a shorter timescale. Therefore, revisiting evolutionary calculations using the correct approach is necessary. This study is essential for developing the dynamics of crustal fractures and the magnetic field evolution in a magnetar.

Giant eruptions (GEs) in luminous blue variables are years-to-decades-long episodes of enhanced mass loss from the outer layers of the star during which the star undergoes major changes in its physical and observed properties. We use the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics stellar evolution code to model the evolution of a 70 M⊙ star that undergoes a GE. We let the star evolve to the termination of the main sequence, and when it reaches T ≃ 19,400 K we emulate a GE by removing mass from its outer layers at a rate of 0.15 M⊙ yr−1 for 20 yr. As mass is being lost, the star contracts and releases a substantial amount of gravitational energy. The star undergoes an initial ≃3 days of expansion followed by years of contraction. During that time the star tries to reach an equilibrium state, and as a result of loss in gravitational energy, its luminosity drops about 1 order of magnitude. As the GE terminates, we let the star continue to evolve without any further mass loss and track its recovery as it regains its equilibrium by adjusting its internal structure. After ≃87 yr it reaches a state very close to the one where the GE was first initiated. We suggest that at this point another GE or a cycle of GEs may occur.

这篇文章使用来自Big Bear太阳观测台的高时间和空间分辨率的光谱学数据和高分辨率磁图，研究了2021年8月7日17:00 UT观察到的一个大小约为2″ × 5″的安静太阳小丝及其微耀斑。通过Hα和Ca ii 8542 Å线谱，确定了小丝激活时的温度和非热速度，并观察到了随着爆发，小丝温度的变化以及其热能和动能的估计值。同时，从NIRIS磁图中发现了与小丝爆发同时发生的小尺度磁通量的出现和抵消，以及磁能的改变。这些色球小丝的光谱诊断数据对以前基于日冕图像的小丝爆发研究进行了补充。<br /><br /> <div>
Minifilament eruptions producing small jets and microflares have mostly been studied based on coronal observations at extreme-ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths. This study presents chromospheric plasma diagnostics of a quiet-Sun minifilament of size ∼ 2″ × 5″ with a sigmoidal shape and an associated microflare observed on 2021 August 7 17:00 UT using high temporal and spatial resolution spectroscopy from the Fast Imaging Solar Spectrograph (FISS) and high-resolution magnetograms from the Near InfraRed Imaging Spectropolarimeter (NIRIS) installed on the 1.6 m Goode Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory. Using FISS Hα and Ca ii 8542 Å line spectra at the time of the minifilament activation we determined a temperature of 8600 K and a nonthermal speed of 7.9 km s−1. During the eruption, the minifilament was no longer visible in the Ca ii 8542 Å line, and only the Hα line spectra were used to find the temperature of the minifilament, which reached 1.2 × 104 K and decreased afterward. We estimated thermal energy of 3.6 × 1024 erg from the maximum temperature and kinetic energy of 2.6 × 1024 erg from the rising speed (18 km s−1) of the minifilament. From the NIRIS magnetograms we found small-scale flux emergence and cancellation coincident with the minifilament eruption, and the magnetic energy change across the conjugate footpoints reaches 7.2 × 1025 erg. Such spectroscopic diagnostics of the chromospheric minifilament complement earlier studies of minifilament eruptions made using coronal images.

本研究利用Planck和Stratosphere Observatory for Infrared Astronomy对Musca和OMC-1两个区域的尘埃偏振进行观测，验证了辐射力矩范式（RAT）中的辐射力矩对齐（RAT-A）和破坏（RAT-D）效应。在Musca区域，观测结果表明偏振度P随着极化角分散函数的增加和柱密度N(H2)的增加而减小，与RAT-A效应一致。而在OMC-1区域，考虑到B场纠缠和RAT-D效应后，我们的数值模型成功地再现了观测结果。这些结果为RAT范式提供了更加可靠的观测证据，特别是最近发现的RAT-D效应。
<br /><br />总结: Planck和Stratosphere Observatory for Infrared Astronomy观测了Musca和OMC-1的尘埃偏振；观测验证了辐射力矩对齐（RAT-A）和破坏（RAT-D）效应；Musca区域表明了RAT-A效应；OMC-1区域考虑到B场纠缠和RAT-D效应后，数值模型再现了观测结果；结果为RAT范式提供了更加可靠的观测证据。 <div>
Polarization of starlight and thermal dust emission caused by aligned dust grains is a valuable tool to characterize magnetic fields (B-fields) and constrain dust properties. However, the grain alignment physics is not fully understood. To test the radiative torque (RAT) paradigm, including RAT alignment (RAT-A) and disruption (RAT-D), we use dust polarization observed by Planck and Stratosphere Observatory for Infrared Astronomy/High-resolution Airborne Wideband Camera Plus toward two filaments, Musca and OMC-1, with contrasting physical conditions. Musca, a quiescent filament, is ideal for testing RAT-A, while OMC-1, an active star-forming region OMC-1, is most suitable for testing RAT-D. We found that polarization fraction, P, decreases with increasing polarization angle dispersion function, , and increasing column density, N(H2), consistent with RAT-A. However, P increases with increasing dust temperature, Td, but decreases when Td reaches a certain high value. We compute the polarization fraction for the ideal models with B-fields in the plane of sky based on the RAT paradigm, accounting for the depolarization effect by B-field tangling. We then compare the realistic polarization model with observations. For Musca with well-ordered B-fields, our numerical model successfully reproduces the decline of P toward the filament spine (aka polarization hole), having higher N(H2) and lower Td, indicating the loss of grain alignment efficiency due to RAT-A. For OMC-1, with stronger B-field variations and higher temperatures, our model can reproduce the observed P–Td and P−N(H2) relations only if the B-field tangling and RAT-D effect are incorporated. Our results provide more robust observational evidence for the RAT paradigm, particularly the recently discovered RAT-D.

预测伽马射线暴（GRBs）的前体是通过使用支持向量机统计的分类技术，利用标准观测和分析来实现的。这一技术提供了比先前基于射电波段持续时间的两成分高斯混合更细致的预测。通过对Fermi/伽马射线爆发监视器、Swift/爆发警报望远镜和Swift/X射线望远镜数据进行进一步的协方差测试，研究发现，仅基于暴发特性的分类提供了对最近证据的观点，即合并和塌缩星存在于“长”和“短”GRB种群中。<br /><br />总结: 本研究利用支持向量机统计的分类技术对伽马射线暴的前体进行预测，并发现了先前分类方法的局限性。通过对伽马射线暴监测器和望远镜数据的进一步分析，揭示了长短伽马射线暴种群存在合并和塌缩星的证据。 <div>
Using an established classification technique, we leverage standard observations and analyses to predict the progenitors of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). This technique, utilizing support vector machine statistics, provides a more nuanced prediction than the previous two-component Gaussian mixture in duration of the prompt gamma-ray emission. Based on further covariance testing from Fermi/Gamma Ray Burst Monitor, Swift/Burst Alert Telescope, and Swift/X-Ray Telescope data, we find that our classification based only on prompt emission properties gives perspective on the recent evidence that mergers and collapsars exist in both “long” and “short” GRB populations.

总结: 本研究利用JWST的新观测数据，对五颗原恒星的中心区域进行了亮CO基本发射的研究。通过提取两个振动带的近红外和中红外频谱中的CO线发射图像和通量，发现13CO未被探测到，表明12CO发射为光学薄。利用H2发射线对CO通量进行校正，并构建了CO线的旋转图，估计了旋转温度和CO分子数。对v=1需要两个不同的旋转温度组分，v=2需要一个更热的组分。13CO的流失表明选择性的UV光解作用，可能解释了v=2的更高旋转温度。平均振动温度约为1000K，与最低旋转温度组分相似。根据测得的旋转和振动温度推断CO分子的总数，我们发现总气体质量范围从约低限为10^22克的最小质量原恒星到约10^26克的最大质量原恒星。我们的气体质量下限与更成熟系统中的相吻合，暗示最低旋转温度组分来自内部盘，并且也不能排除来自较大质量目标的盘风对CO发射的贡献。<br /> <div>
We investigate the bright CO fundamental emission in the central regions of five protostars in their primary mass assembly phase using new observations from JWST’s Near-Infrared Spectrograph and Mid-Infrared Instrument. CO line emission images and fluxes are extracted for a forest of ∼150 rovibrational transitions from two vibrational bands, v = 1−0 and v = 2−1. However, 13CO is undetected, indicating that 12CO emission is optically thin. We use H2 emission lines to correct fluxes for extinction and then construct rotation diagrams for the CO lines with the highest spectral resolution and sensitivity to estimate rotational temperatures and numbers of CO molecules. Two distinct rotational temperature components are required for v = 1 (∼600 to 1000 K and 2000 to ∼104 K), while one hotter component is required for v = 2 (≳3500 K). 13CO is depleted compared to the abundances found in the interstellar medium, indicating selective UV photodissociation of 13CO; therefore, UV radiative pumping may explain the higher rotational temperatures in v = 2. The average vibrational temperature is ∼1000 K for our sources and is similar to the lowest rotational temperature components. Using the measured rotational and vibrational temperatures to infer a total number of CO molecules, we find that the total gas masses range from lower limits of ∼1022 g for the lowest mass protostars to ∼1026 g for the highest mass protostars. Our gas mass lower limits are compatible with those in more evolved systems, which suggest the lowest rotational temperature component comes from the inner disk, scattered into our line of sight, but we also cannot exclude the contribution to the CO emission from disk winds for higher mass targets.

We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) observations of warm CO and H2O gas in emission toward the low-mass protostar IRAS 15398-3359, observed as part of the CORINOS program. The CO is detected via the rovibrational fundamental band and hot band near 5 μm, whereas the H2O is detected in the rovibrational bending mode at 6–8 μm. Rotational analysis indicates that the CO originates in a hot reservoir with an excitation temperature of 1598 ± 118 K, while the water is much cooler at 204 ± 7 K. Neither the CO nor the H2O line images are significantly spatially extended, constraining the emission to within ∼40 au of the protostar. The compactness and high temperature of the CO are consistent with an origin in the embedded protostellar disk, or in a compact disk wind. In contrast, the water must arise from a cooler region and requires a larger emitting area (compared to the CO) to produce the observed fluxes. The water may arise from a more extended part of the disk, or from the inner portion of the outflow cavity. Thus, the origin of the molecular emission observed with JWST remains ambiguous. Better constraints on the overall extinction, comparison with realistic disk models, and future kinematically resolved observations may all help to pinpoint the true emitting reservoirs.

<div> 高红移、双活跃星系核、X射线源、贝叶斯因子、上限

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了62个高红移（2.5 < z < 3.5）X射线源，旨在确定高红移宇宙中双活跃星系核的频率。使用BAYMAX分析工具，对每个X射线源进行分析，未发现强有力的双活跃星系核证据。通过比较测得的贝叶斯因子分布和预期的单点源样本分布，未在样本中发现双活跃星系核。虽然该研究利用了最大的Chandra高z X射线点源目录，但结果受到源于高斯时空分辨率和探测源的典型计数率的限制。该研究得出在2.5 < z < 3.5范围内X射线双活跃星系核比例的上限为4.8%。未来需要更大范围、更暗的通量的X射线测量来大幅扩展这些结果，而AXIS任务概念有望在这方面发挥潜在作用。 <div>
We present an analysis searching for dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) among 62 high-redshift (2.5 < z < 3.5) X-ray sources selected from the X-UDS, AEGIS-XD, CDF-S, and COSMOS-Legacy Chandra surveys. We aim to quantify the frequency of dual AGN in the high-redshift Universe, which holds implications for black hole merger timescales and low-frequency gravitational wave detection rates. We analyze each X-ray source using BAYMAX, an analysis tool that calculates the Bayes factor for whether a given archival Chandra AGN is more likely a single or dual point source. We find no strong evidence for dual AGN in any individual source in our sample. We increase our sensitivity to search for dual AGN across the sample by comparing our measured distribution of Bayes factors to that expected from a sample composed entirely of single point sources and find no evidence for dual AGN in the sample distribution. Although our analysis utilizes one of the largest Chandra catalogs of high-z X-ray point sources available to study, the findings remain limited by the modest number of sources observed at the highest spatial resolution with Chandra and the typical count rates of the detected sources. Our nondetection allows us to place an upper limit on the X-ray dual AGN fraction at 2.5 < z < 3.5 of 4.8% at the 95% confidence level. Expanding substantially on these results at X-ray wavelengths will require future surveys spanning larger sky areas and extending to fainter fluxes than has been possible with Chandra. We illustrate the potential of the AXIS mission concept in this regard.

G型食双星对KM UMa的首次详细光度测定和光谱分析表明，该系统是一个短周期的独立食双星。根据光谱观测数据，确定了质量比q=0.45（±0.04）。利用TESS的光变曲线和其他调查数据，以及多波段观测，发现了正负的O'Connell效应，并且这些效应在过去20年中逐渐交替出现，这可以通过主星表面的黑斑来解释。此外，在SuperWASP数据中还检测到了一个超大耀斑事件，进一步表明KM UMa是一个非常活跃的系统。通过分析数百个中分辨率谱线和一个低分辨率谱线，发现Hα线的当量宽度变化，表明存在一个5.21（±0.67）年的磁活动周期。利用O-C方法分析了轨道周期的变化，检测到了一个长期减小的趋势以及一个周期性变化。周期性变化的振幅为0.01124（±0.00004）天，周期为33.66（±0.0012）年，超过了5.21年的活动周期，这更可能是由第三体的光行时效应造成的。同时，基于Gaia的星表观测数据，还发现了一个视星等伴星，表明KM UMa实际上处于一个2+1+1的等级四重星系统中。<br /><br />总结: 本文首次对G型食双星KM UMa进行了详细的光度和光谱分析，确定了其短周期性质，发现了O'Connell效应和超大耀斑事件，并且发现了5.21年的磁活动周期和更长周期的轨道周期变化，最后确认了KM UMa实际上是一个包含两个视伴星的等级四重星系统。 <div>
The first detailed photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the G-type eclipsing binary KM UMa is presented, which indicates that the system is a short-period detached eclipsing binary. The radial velocity curves were calculated using the cross-correlation function method based on Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and our observations, which determined the mass ratio as q = 0.45 (±0.04). Based on the light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, other survey data, and our multiband observations, the positive and negative O’Connell effects have been detected evolving gradually and alternately over the last 20 yr, which can be explained by the presence of spots on the primary component. A superflare event was detected in the SuperWASP data on 2007 February 28, further indicating that KM UMa is a very active system. We calculated its energy to be 5 × 1034 erg by assuming it occurred on the primary star. Utilizing hundreds of medium-resolution spectra and one low-resolution spectrum, the equivalent width variations of the Hα line were calculated, indicating the presence of a 5.21 (±0.67) yr magnetic activity cycle. The orbital period variations were analyzed using the O–C method, detecting a long-term decrease superimposed with a periodic variation. The amplitude of the cyclic variation is 0.01124 (±0.00004) day, with a period of 33.66 (±0.0012) yr, which exceeds the 5.21 yr activity cycle, suggesting that this is more likely attributable to the light travel time effect of a third body. Simultaneously, a visual companion has been detected based on the Gaia astrometric data, indicating that KM UMa is actually in a 2+1+1 hierarchical quadruple system.

Over the last decade, studies of large samples of binary systems have identified chemical anomalies and shown that they might be attributed to planet formation or planet engulfment. However, both scenarios have primarily been tested in pairs without known exoplanets. In this work, we explore these scenarios in the newly detected planet-hosting wide binary TOI-1173 A/B (projected separation ∼11,400 au), using high-resolution MAROON-X and ARCES spectra. We determined photospheric stellar parameters both by fitting stellar models and via the spectroscopic equilibrium approach. Both analyses agree and suggest that they are cool main-sequence stars located in the thin disk. A line-by-line differential analysis between the components (B−A) displays an abundance pattern in the condensation temperature plane, where the planet-hosting star TOI-1173 A is enhanced in refractory elements such as iron by more than 0.05 dex. This suggests the engulfment of ∼18 M⊕ of rocky material in star A. Our hypothesis is supported by the dynamics of the system (detailed in our companion paper), which suggest that the super-Neptune TOI-1173 A b might have been delivered to its current short period (∼7 days) through circularization and von Zeipel–Lidov–Kozai mechanisms, thereby triggering the engulfment of inner rocky exoplanets.

总结: <br />
本文研究了利用X射线观测提供重要见解的太阳耀斑中非热电子的加速和传播。研究发现，在耀斑条件下，传统的冷靶模型无法很好地描述低能截断，因此引入了温靶模型来更好地描述能谱。另外，研究还发现卡帕分布作为电子注入的更合适表示形式，并且在两次M级耀斑的分析中得到了较好的拟合结果。最后，研究还表明使用卡帕分布能够提供有关电子加速过程的宝贵信息，包括总电子数密度和平均能量。 <div>
X-ray observations provide important and valuable insights into the acceleration and propagation of nonthermal electrons during solar flares. Improved X-ray spectral analysis requires a deeper understanding of the dynamics of energetic electrons. Previous studies have demonstrated that the dynamics of accelerated electrons with a few thermal speeds are more complex than those with significantly higher speeds. To better describe the energetic electrons after injection, a model considering energy diffusion and thermalization effects in flare conditions (the warm-target model) has recently been developed for spectral analysis of hard X-rays. This model has demonstrated how the low-energy cutoff, which can hardly be constrained in cold-target modeling, can be determined. However, the power-law form may not be the most suitable representation of injected electrons. The kappa distribution, which is proposed as a physical consequence of electron acceleration, has been applied successfully in RHESSI spectral analysis. In this study, we employ the kappa-form injected electrons in the warm-target model to analyze two M-class flares, observed by RHESSI and the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays, respectively. The best-fit results show that the kappa-form energetic electron spectrum generates lower nonthermal energy than the power-law form when producing a similar photon spectrum in the fit range. We also demonstrated that the fit parameters associated with the kappa-form electron spectrum can be well determined with small uncertainty. Further, the kappa distribution, which covers the entire electron energy range, enables the determination of key electron properties such as total electron number density and average energy at the flare site, providing valuable information on electron acceleration processes.

We present results from our deep far-ultraviolet (FUV) survey using AstroSat/UVIT of a filamentary structure at z ∼0.072. A total of four filaments comprising 58 galaxies were probed in our study. We detect 18 filament galaxies in our FUV observation. All filament galaxies are further classified based on their photometric color, nuclear activity, and morphology. The filaments contain galaxies with mixed stellar population types and structures. We do not detect galaxies in our UVIT survey up to a distance of 0.4 Mpc h−1 from the filament axis, implying a lack of recent star formation in the inner region of filaments. The FUV star formation rate (SFR) for star-forming galaxies agrees well with the SFR144MHz calculated using Low-Frequency Array radio-continuum observations. We witness an increase in the FUV specific-SFR (sSFR) of filament galaxies with increasing distance from the filament spine (Dfil). The intermediate-to-high stellar mass filament galaxies were more star-forming than cluster galaxies in a fixed stellar mass bin. The FUV morphology of some filament galaxies detected in the filament outskirts (Dfil ≳ 0.7 Mpc h−1) is comparable to or slightly extended than their optical counterpart. The mass assembly of galaxies examined by estimating (FUV − r) color gradients shows that more “red-cored’ galaxies reside in the outer region of the filaments. Our results prove that the likelihood of merger interaction and gas starvation increases when approaching the filament spine. We report a definitive and inhomogeneous impact of filaments on the galaxies residing inside them.

Using the “best-bet” models of Sgr A* from the EHT Collaboration, we assess whether this nondetection is expected for current facilities and explore the prospects of detecting a jet with very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) at four frequencies: 86, 115, 230, and 345 GHz. We produce synthetic image reconstructions for current and next-generation VLBI arrays at these frequencies that include the effects of interstellar scattering, optical depth, and time variability. We find that no existing VLBI arrays are expected to detect the jet in these best-bet models, consistent with observations to date. We show that next-generation VLBI arrays at 86 and 115 GHz—in particular, the EHT after upgrades through the ngEHT program and the ngVLA—successfully capture the jet in our tests due to improvements in instrument sensitivity and (u, v) coverage at spatial scales critical to jet detection. These results highlight the potential of enhanced VLBI capabilities in the coming decade to reveal the crucial properties of Sgr A* and its interaction with the Galactic center environment.

总结:<br />
本文介绍了一种扩展传统速率方程方法的框架，用于将不同的结合位点纳入气冰天体化学模型中。作者提出了一种估算吸附物种占据各种位点的概率密度函数的简单方法，通过加权的热解吸和跳跃速率，将结合能分布的影响纳入速率方程方法中。这种方法准确而高效，可以应用于包含数百种冰物种的大型气冰化学网络。文章还首次定量讨论了结合能分布对星际冰组成的影响。 <div>
One of the most serious limitations of current astrochemical models with the rate equation (RE) approach is that only a single type of binding site is considered in grain surface chemistry, although laboratory and quantum chemical studies have found that surfaces contain various binding sites with different potential energy depths. When various sites exist, adsorbed species can be trapped in deep potential sites, increasing the resident time on the surface. On the other hand, adsorbed species can be populated in shallow sites, activating thermal hopping and thus two-body reactions even at low temperatures, where the thermal hopping from deeper sites is not activated. Such behavior cannot be described by the conventional RE approach. In this work, I present a framework for incorporating various binding sites (i.e., binding energy distribution) in gas-ice astrochemical models as an extension of the conventional RE approach. I propose a simple method to estimate the probability density function (pdf) for the occupation of various sites by adsorbed species, assuming a quasi-steady state. By using thermal desorption and hopping rates weighted by the pdfs, the effect of binding energy distribution is incorporated into the RE approach without increasing the number of ordinary differential equations to be solved. This method is found to be accurate and computationally efficient, and enables us to consider binding energy distribution even for a large gas-ice chemical network which contains hundreds of icy species. The impact of the binding energy distribution on interstellar ice composition is discussed quantitatively for the first time.

In the upcoming gravitational-wave (GW) observing runs, identifying host galaxies is crucial as it provides essential redshift information and enables the use of GW events as standard sirens. However, pinpointing host galaxies remains challenging due to the large localization uncertainties and the rapidly fading nature of their optical counterparts. Analyzing the host galaxies of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) offers an alternative approach to deepen our understanding of the environments where binary neutron stars (BNS) primarily merge. This study compiles archival photometric data for the host galaxies of 76 sGRBs and four hybrid GRBs that are long GRBs accompanied by kilonova-like signals. We use this data to evaluate their physical properties through spectral energy distribution fitting. To assess the characteristics of the host galaxies, we utilized a volume-limited sample (z < 0.5) from the COSMOS field as a control group. Contrary to expectations that the BNS merger rate is proportional to host stellar mass, the short and hybrid GRB population appears less massive than the mass-weighted distribution of the control sample. Instead, we propose a formulation for the expected BNS merger rate from a galaxy as + , which optimally explains the deviation between the stellar mass distributions of the GRB host galaxies and the control sample. These insights provide a strategic framework for targeted GW follow-ups and enhance our ability to identify potential host galaxies for future GW events.

<div> 超巨星, 超巨大, 恒星, 质量流失, 观测

总结:<br /><br />研究发现超巨星如红超巨星和超超巨星可能是II型超新星的祖先,它们在演化的最后阶段会喷射大量物质. 观测表明,由于大对流细胞的活动和脉动的作用,这些恒星可能出现质量流失事件. 本研究利用干涉观测CHARA阵列对著名的黄色超巨星ρ Cas进行了研究,发现了巨大的热点和冷斑,这些可能与恒星的物质喷射有关. 此外,在K波段观测到CO发射线,揭示了一个扩展的星周包层. <div>
Massive evolved stars such as red supergiants and hypergiants are potential progenitors of Type II supernovae, and they are known for ejecting substantial amounts of matter, up to half their initial mass, during their final evolutionary phases. The rate and mechanism of this mass loss play a crucial role in determining their ultimate fate and the likelihood of their progression to supernovae. However, the exact mechanisms driving this mass ejection have long been a subject of research. Recent observations, such as the Great Dimming of Betelgeuse, have suggested that the activity of large convective cells, combined with pulsation, could be a plausible explanation for such mass-loss events. In this context, we conducted interferometric observations of the famous yellow hypergiant, ρ Cassiopeiae using the CHARA Array in H- and K-band wavelengths. ρ Cas is well known for its recurrent eruptions, characterized by periods of visual dimming (∼1.5–2 mag) followed by recovery. From our observations, we derived the diameter of the limb-darkened disk and found that this star has a radius of 1.04 ± 0.01 mas, or 564–700 R⊙. We performed image reconstructions with three different image reconstruction software packages, and they unveiled the presence of giant hot and cold spots on the stellar surface. We interpret these prominent hot spots as giant convection cells, suggesting a possible connection to mass ejections from the star’s envelope. Furthermore, we detected spectral CO emission lines in the K band (λ = 2.31–2.38 μm), and the image reconstructions in these spectral lines revealed an extended circumstellar envelope with a radius of 1.45 ± 0.10 mas.

We present a multifrequency polarimetric study for the quasar 1604+159. The source was observed at the L band with the American Very Long Baseline Array and the L, X, and U bands with the Very Large Array. These observations provide different resolutions from mas to arcsec, enabling us to probe the morphology and magnetic field from tens of parsec to hundreds of kiloparsec scale. We detect a symmetrical Fanaroff–Riley Class I–like structure. The source has several lobes and bulges, forming a cocoon shape. The polarization is normal to the edges of the structure with high fractional polarization up to ∼60%. Two hotspots are observed at the eastern and western sides of the source, located symmetrically relative to the core. The flux density ratio (>1.5) between the two hotspots suggests the Doppler beaming effect exists at a large scale. The polarized emission in the hotspots also shows a symmetrical structure with an oblique direction from the jet direction. In general, the jet propagates in a collimating structure with several bends. Polarization is also detected perpendicular to the local jet from ∼100 mas to ∼1″. The jet shows strong polarized intensity and high fractional polarization at the bending edges. We discuss the possible origins of the observed structure and magnetic field.

总结: <br />这篇文章研究了黑洞吸积盘风系统的中微子辐射。在模拟初期发现了电子激元数（ELN）-额外激元数（XLN）交叉现象，但随着时间推移，这种交叉现象只在赤道附近存在。文章对中微子辐射场的几何结构和演变进行了详细分析，并通过与其他发表作品的定性评估，讨论了造成差异的原因。研究发现的ELN-XLN交叉及快速味道不稳定性的几何结构和演变对中子星并合的重元素核成因具有重要意义。 <br /> <div>
We postprocess a three-dimensional, general relativistic, full transport neutrino radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulation of the black-hole-accretion disk-wind system thought to be a potential outcome of the GW170817 merger to investigate the presence of electron lepton number (ELN-XLN) crossings in the neutrino angular distribution. Neutrinos are evolved with an explicit Monte Carlo method and can interact with matter via emission, absorption, or scattering. Within the postprocessing framework, we find ubiquitous occurrence of ELN-XLN crossings at early times (∼11 ms), but this does not hold for later times in the simulation. At postmerger times of ∼60 ms and beyond, ELN-XLN crossings are only present near the equator. We provide a detailed analysis of the neutrino radiation field to investigate the origin and time evolution of these crossings. Previous reports have suggested ubiquitous flavor crossings persisting throughout the simulation lifetime, albeit for different sets of conditions for the merger remnant, the treatment of hydrodynamics, and neutrino transport. Even though we do not perform a direct comparison with other published works, we qualitatively assess the reasons for the difference with our results. The geometric structure and evolution of the ELN-XLN crossings found in our analysis, and by extension, fast flavor instabilities, have important implications for heavy element nucleosynthesis in neutron star mergers.

<div> Alfvén waves, solar wind, turbulence, dynamic alignment, Helios 2 spacecraft
<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了太阳风动力学对动态对齐的影响。研究表明太阳风的湍流受动态对齐影响，但小尺度上并无动态对齐。通过Helios 2航天器观测慢速太阳风间隔，发现只有反向Alfvén波会经历动态对齐，非Alfvén结构则不参与对齐过程。研究还发现，随着尺度缩小，反向Alfvén波的功率比逐渐减小，而非Alfvén结构的功率比在增加。这暗示着需要新的理论模型来充分解释太阳风的可压缩性、间歇性和不平衡性。 <div>
The solar wind dynamics are thought to be governed by counter-propagating Alfvén waves. Alfvén waves generate a turbulent cascade through nonlinear couplings between shearing wave packets. However, imbalances, structures, and intermittency complicate the solar wind’s magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. Simulations and theories have suggested that dynamic alignment, or the tendency for velocity and magnetic fluctuations to become more correlated as a function of scale, may dictate the turbulent cascade. Observations have hinted at dynamic alignment at large scales but remain inconclusive at small scales. To investigate the nature of dynamically aligning fluctuations in the solar wind, we examine slow wind intervals from the Helios 2 spacecraft. We develop a two-component model of solar wind turbulence consisting of Alfvénic and non-Alfvénic contributions. We assume that only counter-propagating Alfvén waves experience dynamic alignment, and the non-Alfvénic structures do not participate in the alignment process. Our model allows us to constrain the relative contribution of inward Alfvén waves and non-Alfvénic structures with respect to the amplitude of outward Alfvén waves in the slow solar wind as a function of scale under the assumption of dynamic alignment. We show that the power ratio of inward to outward Alfvén fluctuations decreases as a function of scale. At the same time, the non-Alfvénic structures to outward Alfvén fluctuations increase with decreasing scale. Increasing structures provide a possible explanation for no dynamic alignment at small scales. Our study implies the need for new theoretical models to fully account for the solar wind’s compressibility, intermittency, and imbalanced nature.

The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is a unique facility for survey astronomy that will soon be commissioned and begin operations. Crucial to many of its scientific goals is the achievement of sustained high image quality, limited only by the seeing at the site. This will be maintained through an active optics system that controls optical element misalignments and corrects mirror figure error to minimize aberrations caused by both thermal and gravitational effects. However, the large number of adjustment degrees of freedom available on the Rubin Observatory introduces a range of degeneracies, including many that are induced by noise due to imperfect measurement of the wave-front errors. We present a structured methodology for identifying these degeneracies through an analysis of image noise level. We also present a novel scaling strategy based on truncated singular value decomposition that mitigates the degeneracy and optimally distributes the adjustment over the available degrees of freedom. Our approach ensures the attainment of optimal image quality, while avoiding excursions around the noise-induced subspace of degeneracies, marking a significant improvement over the previous techniques adopted for Rubin, which were based on an optimal integral controller. This new approach is likely to also yield significant benefits for all telescopes that incorporate large numbers of degrees of freedom of adjustment.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用连续小波变换技术分析了宇宙流体速度场的湍流运动，并通过IllustrisTNG模拟数据构建了全局和环境相关的小波统计特征，如能谱和峰度，研究了湍流运动的波动和间歇性。研究发现能谱的峰值尺度定义了一个特征尺度，可视为湍流的整体尺度，而奈奎斯特波数可视为耗散尺度。有了这两个特征尺度，能谱可分为能量包含范围、惯性范围和耗散范围。小波峰度是波数k的增函数，随着k的增加而迅速变化，然后变化缓慢，表明宇宙流体随着波数k的增加变得更加间歇。在能量包含范围内，能谱在z = 2到1之间显著增加，但在z = 1到0之间几乎保持不变。环境相关的能谱和峰度与全局特征相似，而且在最低密度环境中能谱的幅度最小，在最高密度环境中最大，表明高密度环境中的宇宙流体湍动比低密度环境中更加剧烈。在惯性范围内，能谱的指数比科尔莫哥洛夫和波尔格指数更陡，表明了更有效的能量转移。 <div>
We use continuous wavelet transform techniques to construct the global and environment-dependent wavelet statistics, such as energy spectrum and kurtosis, to study the fluctuation and intermittency of the turbulent motion in the cosmic fluid velocity field with the IllustrisTNG simulation data. We find that the peak scale of the energy spectrum defines a characteristic scale, which can be regarded as the integral scale of turbulence, and the Nyquist wavenumber can be regarded as the dissipation scale. With these two characteristic scales, the energy spectrum can be divided into the energy-containing range, the inertial range, and the dissipation range of turbulence. The wavelet kurtosis is an increasing function of the wavenumber k, which first grows rapidly then slowly with k, indicating that the cosmic fluid becomes increasingly intermittent with k. In the energy-containing range, the energy spectrum increases significantly from z = 2 to 1, but remains almost unchanged from z = 1 to 0. We find that both the environment-dependent spectrum and kurtosis are similar to the global ones, and the magnitude of the spectrum is smallest in the lowest-density and largest in the highest-density environment, suggesting that the cosmic fluid is more turbulent in a high-density than in a low-density environment. In the inertial range, the energy spectrum’s exponent is steeper than both the Kolmogorov and Burgers exponents, indicating more efficient energy transfer compared to Kolmogorov or Burgers turbulence.

Massive stars may form in or be captured into active galactic nuclei (AGN) disks. Recent 1D studies employing stellar-evolution codes have demonstrated the potential for rapid growth of such stars through accretion up to a few hundred solar masses. We perform 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulations of moderately massive stars’ envelopes in order to determine the rate and critical radius Rcrit of their accretion process in an isotropic gas-rich environment in the absence of luminosity-driven mass loss. We find that in the “fast-diffusion” regime where characteristic radiative diffusion speed c/τ is faster than the gas sound speed cs, the accretion rate is suppressed by feedback from gravitational and radiative advection energy flux, in addition to the stellar luminosity. Alternatively, in the “slow-diffusion” regime where c/τ < cs, due to adiabatic accretion, the stellar envelope expands quickly to become hydrostatic and further net accretion occurs on thermal timescales in the absence of self-gravity. When the radiation entropy of the medium is less than that of the star, however, this hydrostatic envelope can become more massive than the star itself. Within this subregime, the self-gravity of the envelope excites runaway growth. Applying our results to realistic environments, moderately massive stars (≲100M⊙) embedded in AGN disks typically accrete in the fast-diffusion regime, leading to a reduction of steady-state accretion rate 1–2 orders of magnitudes lower than expected by previous 1D calculations and Rcrit smaller than the disk scale height, except in the opacity window at temperature T ∼ 2000 K. Accretion in slow diffusion regime occurs in regions with very high density ρ ≳ 10−9 g cm−3, and needs to be treated with caution in 1D long-term calculations.

The origin of our Galaxy’s high-velocity clouds (HVCs) remains a mystery after many decades of effort. In this paper, we use the TNG50 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project to identify cool, dense clouds that match observations of Galactic H i HVCs. We track these clouds back in time to determine their origin. For a TNG50 Milky Way−like galaxy, we find that only 17% of HVCs can be tracked directly to the disk and 21% to material stripped out of satellites. The majority of HVCs (62%) arise from warm and hot circumgalactic gas that cools through thermal instability. They then obtain their anomalous velocities through interactions with the turbulent circumgalactic medium. At TNG50 resolution, we do not see evidence for HVCs forming out of very low metallicity intergalactic material. Instead, low-metallicity HVCs are most likely associated with satellites. These results suggest that Galactic HVCs are highly heterogeneous in their origin and can provide insight into the physical processes that shape the circumgalactic medium, such as disk outflows, satellite accretion, and thermal instabilities.

利用太阳动力学观测卫星（SDO）和太阳和日球层观测卫星（SOHO）的观测，研究了1999年至2021年间30个明显的电流片，包括SDO的10个在太阳盘面上和8个在边缘，以及SOHO的12个在边缘。每个在太阳盘面上的电流片是由两组大气结构的X型配置形成的，而每个边缘的电流片都涉及耀斑 - 日冕物质抛射事件。在磁重连期间，太阳盘面上的明显电流片从一个明亮点演变为一个细长的线状结构，在重连的后期结构变得很薄。随后，电流片内的等离子体分布呈现为一串等离子体小结。对于边缘的明显电流片，其长度延伸速度快于太阳盘面上的电流片，并且也检测到了变薄的过程。尽管边缘案例的长宽比与模拟研究中撕裂模式不稳定性的发生值相当，但在这些边缘电流片中并没有明显的等离子体小结，并且密度分布局部均匀。我们认为，由于边缘案例的迅速延伸，撕裂模式的不稳定性非常快，导致形成比仪器分辨率更小的微小等离子体小结。此外，还有另一种可能情况。观测到的边缘明显电流片只是一个明亮的射线，实际的电流片只是射线的一个小片段。
<br /><br />总结: 该研究利用SDO和SOHO观测了30个明显的太阳电流片，发现在太阳盘面上和边缘的电流片形成过程和特征有所不同。在磁重连期间，电流片从明亮点演变为细长的线状结构，随后形成等离子体小结。边缘电流片的长度延伸速度更快，并且没有明显的等离子体小结。这对于太阳物理领域的研究具有重要意义。 <div>
Based on observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), we investigate 30 apparent current sheets during 1999–2021, including 10 on-disk and 8 limb ones from the SDO, as well as 12 limb ones from the SOHO. Each on-disk current sheet is formed among an X-type configuration consisting of two sets of atmospheric structures, and each limb one is involved in a flare–coronal mass ejection event. During magnetic reconnection period, the on-disk apparent current sheet evolves from a bright point to an elongated line-like structure, and the structure becomes thin in the late stage of the reconnection. Subsequently, the plasma distribution within the current sheet manifests as a plasmoid chain. For the limb apparent current sheet, the length elongation is faster than that of the on-disk one, and the thinning process is also detected. Although the aspect ratios of the limb cases are comparable to the value for the occurrence of tearing mode instability from simulation research, no obvious plasmoid chain is detected within these limb current sheets, and the density distribution is locally uniform. We suggest that due to the rapid extension of limb cases, the tearing mode instability is very fast, resulting in the formation of tiny plasmoids that are smaller than the instrument resolution. Moreover, there is another possible scenario. The observed limb apparent current sheet is just a bright ray, and the actual current sheet is only a small segment of the ray.

In this work, we report dust and gas observational hints of planet formation in the disk around 2MASS J16120668-301027, as part of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Large Program “AGE-PRO: ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in Protoplanetary disks.” The disk was imaged with the ALMA at Band 6 (1.3 mm) in dust continuum emission and four molecular lines: 12CO(J = 2–1), 13CO(J = 2–1), C18O(J = 2–1), and H2CO(J = 3(3,0)–2(2,0)). Resolved observations of the dust continuum emission (angular resolution of ∼150 mas, 20 au) show a ring-like structure with a peak at 0.″57 (75 au), a deep gap with a minimum at 0.″24 (31 au), an inner disk, a bridge connecting the inner disk and the outer ring, along with a spiral arm structure, and a tentative detection (to 3σ) of a compact emission at the center of the disk gap, with an estimated dust mass of ∼2.7−12.9 Lunar masses. We also detected a kinematic kink (not coincident with any dust substructure) through several 12CO channel maps (angular resolution ∼200 mas, 30 au), located at a radius of ∼0.″875 (115.6 au). After modeling the 12CO velocity rotation around the protostar, we identified a purple tentative rotating-like structure at the kink location with a geometry similar to that of the disk. We discuss potential explanations for the dust and gas substructures observed in the disk and their potential connection to signatures of planet formation.

<div> 黑洞、X射线偏振、吸积几何、太空探测器、极化特性
<br /><br />这篇文章研究了利用X射线偏振来探测黑洞系统的吸积几何。研究发现，不考虑质量的情况下，各种类型的黑洞在极化特性上都非常相似，特别是在硬态时，即在辐射区主导的情况下。这暂时支持了恒星黑洞和超大质量黑洞共享一个相同的辐射区几何结构的假设。 <div>
X-ray polarization provides a new way to probe accretion geometry in black hole systems. If the accretion geometry of black holes is similar regardless of mass, we should expect the same to be true of their polarization properties. We compare the polarimetric properties of all nonblazar black holes observed with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer. We find that their polarization properties are very similar, particularly in the hard state, where the corona dominates. This tentatively supports the idea that stellar and supermassive black holes share a common coronal geometry.

总结: 
这篇文章研究了白矮星被重元素污染的问题，主要关注行星的潮汐破碎过程以及因外部引力扰动导致的污染情况。研究考虑了由白矮星、内行星和外行星组成的三体系统，内行星会周期性地部分破碎，并受到外行星的引力扰动影响，导致碎片向白矮星坠落。内行星的质量流失取决于其内部结构和行星系统的轨道配置。文章提出了对这些问题深入研究的观点。<br /><br /> <div>
About 25%–50% of white dwarfs (WDs) are found to be polluted by heavy elements. It has been argued that the pollution could be caused by the tidal disruption of an approaching planet around the WD, during which a large number of clumps would be produced and would finally fall onto the WD. The reason that the planet approaches the WD is usually believed to be due to gravitational perturbations from another distant planet or stellar companion. However, the dynamics of the perturbations and the detailed partial disruption process are still poorly understood. In this study, we present an in-depth investigation of these issues. A triple system composed of a WD, an inner orbit planet, and an outer orbit planet is considered. The inner planet would be partially disrupted periodically over its long-term evolution. Fragments generated in the process are affected by gravitational perturbations from the remnant planet, facilitating their fall toward the WD. The mass-loss rate of the inner planet depends on both its internal structure and also on the orbital configuration of the planetary system.

总结:
NGC 6822是局部星系群中一个低金属量的矮星系，通过Local Group L-band Survey（LGLBS）的高空间和光谱分辨率探测到了两个局部的原子氢中性吸收特征，这是在麦哲伦云之外的低金属量矮星系中首次明确探测到冷中性介质（CNM）。研究使用了自定义管线对高角分辨率的H i吸收进行搜索，并提取相关的H i发射。进一步的高斯分解和辐射传输分析显示了五个CNM成分，并揭示了其关键特性：平均自旋温度为32 ± 6 K，平均CNM柱密度为3.1 × 1020 cm−2，以及两个视线的CNM质量分数分别为0.33和0.12。H i吸收与星形成区域相交，而H i吸收轮廓包括了CO（2−1）发射，表明了分子气体的巧合和高分辨率H i发射的抑制。进一步分析了附近的一个视线，发现了深而窄的H i自吸收，在这里，背景的暖中性介质被中间的CNM所吸收。CNM、CO和Hα发射的关联暗示了NGC 6822中较冷、较密的H i相和星形成之间的密切联系。 <div>
Measuring the properties of the cold neutral medium (CNM) in low-metallicity galaxies provides insights into heating and cooling mechanisms in early Universe-like environments. We report detections of two localized atomic neutral hydrogen (H i) absorption features in NGC 6822, a low-metallicity (0.2 Z⊙) dwarf galaxy in the Local Group. These are the first unambiguous CNM detections in a low-metallicity dwarf galaxy outside the Magellanic Clouds. The Local Group L-band Survey (LGLBS) enabled these detections, due to its high spatial (15 pc for H i emission) and spectral (0.4 km s−1) resolution. We introduce LGLBS and describe a custom pipeline for searching for H i absorption at high angular resolution and extracting associated H i emission. A detailed Gaussian decomposition and radiative transfer analysis of the NGC 6822 detections reveals five CNM components, with key properties: a mean spin temperature of 32 ± 6 K, a mean CNM column density of 3.1 × 1020 cm−2, and CNM mass fractions of 0.33 and 0.12 for the two sightlines. Stacking nondetections does not reveal low-level signals below our median optical depth sensitivity of 0.05. One detection intercepts a star-forming region, with the H i absorption profile encompassing the CO (2−1) emission, indicating coincident molecular gas and a depression in high-resolution H i emission. We also analyze a nearby sightline with deep, narrow H i self-absorption dips, where the background warm neutral medium is attenuated by intervening CNM. The association of CNM, CO, and Hα emissions suggests a close link between the colder, denser H i phase and star formation in NGC 6822.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章提出了利用Gaia任务收集的数据，通过机器学习技术来自动分类恒星是否属于测量二元系统。研究使用了人工神经网络，并利用了高精度的数据进行训练和测试。结果表明，该方法在分类恒星时具有很高的准确性和效率，是一个有前景的替代方法。 <div>
With nearly two billion stars observed and their corresponding astrometric parameters evaluated in the recent Gaia mission, the number of astrometric binary candidates has risen significantly. Due to the surplus of astrometric data, the current computational methods employed to inspect these astrometric binary candidates are both computationally expensive and cannot be executed in a reasonable time frame. In light of this, a machine learning (ML) technique to automatically classify whether a set of stars belongs to an astrometric binary pair via an artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed. Using data from Gaia Data Release 3, the ANN was trained and tested on 1.5 million highly probable true and visual binaries, considering the proper motions, parallaxes, and angular and physical separations as features. The ANN achieves high classification scores, with an accuracy of 99.3%, a precision rate of 0.988, a recall rate of 0.991, and an area under the curve of 0.999, indicating that the utilized ML technique is a highly effective method for classifying astrometric binaries. Thus, the proposed ANN is a promising alternative to the existing methods for the classification of astrometric binaries.

<br />
在Seyfert 1星系Mrk 817的XMM-Newton和NuSTAR观测中，发现了出乎意料的临时遮挡流，这在该源中以前从未见过。通过高分辨率光栅光谱中的吸收特征，确定遮挡物实际上是一种多相离子化风，具有约5200 km s−1的出流速度，并首次发现在同时期的哈勃空间望远镜光谱中观测到了与相同速度的吸收特征相同离子化的下限组分。我们观察到吸收线的形状在几小时的时间尺度上发生变化，如果归因于沿视线的横向运动，则可将可变组分放置在大约1000个Schwarzschild半径，这一估计与对遮挡物距离独立UV测量相一致，表明存在于内部宽线区域的一个吸积盘风。我们估计出流需要大约200天从盘面到我们的视线，这与整个观测过程中流的柱密度变化的时间尺度一致。
<br /><br />总结: Seyfert 1星系Mrk 817的观测发现了一种之前未见的离子化风遮挡物，其在X射线和紫外线光谱中的吸收特征表现出多相并具有变化。测量距离遮挡物的方法为对相同参数的独立测量进行了估计。 <div>
We present the results of the XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations taken as part of the ongoing, intensive multiwavelength monitoring program of the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 817 by the AGN Space Telescope and Optical Reverberation Mapping 2 (AGN STORM 2) Project. The campaign revealed an unexpected and transient obscuring outflow, never before seen in this source. Of our four XMM-Newton/NuSTAR epochs, one fortuitously taken during a bright X-ray state has strong narrow absorption lines in the high-resolution grating spectra. From these absorption features, we determine that the obscurer is in fact a multiphase ionized wind with an outflow velocity of ∼5200 km s−1, and for the first time find evidence for a lower ionization component with the same velocity observed in absorption features in the contemporaneous Hubble Space Telescope spectra. This indicates that the UV absorption troughs may be due to dense clumps embedded in diffuse, higher ionization gas responsible for the X-ray absorption lines of the same velocity. We observe variability in the shape of the absorption lines on timescales of hours, placing the variable component at roughly 1000 Rg if attributed to transverse motion along the line of sight. This estimate aligns with independent UV measurements of the distance to the obscurer suggesting an accretion disk wind at the inner broad line region. We estimate that it takes roughly 200 days for the outflow to travel from the disk to our line of sight, consistent with the timescale of the outflow's column density variations throughout the campaign.

It is generally recognized that the electromagnetic multipolar emission from magnetars can be used to explain radiation from soft gamma repeaters or anomalous X-ray pulsars, but they have little impact on the spin-down of magnetars. We here present an analytical solution for the neutron star multipolar electromagnetic fields and their associated expected luminosities. We find that for newborn millisecond magnetars, the spin-down luminosity from higher multipolar components can match or even exceed that from the dipole component. Such high-intensity radiation will undoubtedly affect related astrophysical phenomena at the birth of a magnetar. We show that the spin-down luminosity from multipoles can well explain the majority of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows, from the plateau starting at several hundred seconds until the normal decay phase lasting for many years. The fitted magnetar parameters for GRB afterglows are all typical values, with spins in the millisecond range and magnetic field strengths on the order of 1014–1015 G. Our results, in turn, provide support for the hypothesis that GRBs originate from the birth of magnetars with a period of a few milliseconds, thus deepening our understanding of the complex magnetic field structure and the equation of state of magnetars.

总结:
研究通过高分辨率数值模拟和风洞模拟，了解尘埃在热银河风中的演化和存活情况。发现尘埃在所有情况下都能够在风中存活，甚至在没有冷相遮挡的情况下也是如此。根据模拟云团特性，估计0.1μm尘埃能够有60%存活并分布在晕气和冷相。还研究了尘埃颗粒大小对结果的影响，发现小于0.01μm的颗粒无法抵御热相暴露，说明观测到的CGM中的小颗粒要么是由大颗粒破碎产生，要么是在冷相中带到那里。最后，还表明尘埃气比随着距离的增加而下降，这为观测到的宇宙中大量尘埃提供了一个解释。<br /><br /> <div>
We present a suite of high-resolution numerical simulations to study the evolution and survival of dust in hot galactic winds. We implement a novel dust framework in the Cholla hydrodynamics code and use wind tunnel simulations of cool, dusty clouds to understand how thermal sputtering affects the dust content of galactic winds. Our simulations illustrate how various regimes of cloud evolution impact dust survival, dependent on cloud size, wind properties, and dust grain size. We find that significant amounts of dust can survive in winds in all scenarios, even without shielding from the cool phase of outflows. We present an analytic framework that explains this result, along with an analysis of the impact of cloud evolution on the total fraction of dust survival. Using these results, we estimate that 60% of 0.1 μm dust that enters a starburst-driven wind could survive to populate both the hot and cool phases of the halo, based on a simulated distribution of cloud properties. We also investigate how these conclusions depend on grain size, exploring grains from 0.1 μm to 10 Å. Under most circumstances, grains smaller than 0.01 μm cannot withstand hot-phase exposure, suggesting that the small grains observed in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) are either formed in situ due to the shattering of larger grains, or must be carried there in the cool phase of outflows. Finally, we show that the dust-to-gas ratio of clouds declines as a function of distance from the galaxy due to cloud–wind mixing and condensation. These results provide an explanation for the vast amounts of dust observed in the CGMs of galaxies and beyond.

本文通过分析Advanced Composition Explorer/Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer He+ double-coincidence pickup ion (PUI)的测量数据，研究了太阳圈与局部星际介质的相互作用。研究发现在1998年至2010年间，太阳风的流向并没有明显的变化趋势，通过拟合kappa函数和移除与日冕质量抛射相关的测量数据，得到这一结论。因此，可以得出太阳圈与局部星际介质的相互作用在该时期并没有发生明显的变化。 <div>
The size, shape, and composition of the heliosphere are affected by its interaction with the local interstellar medium. A means of quantifying this interaction is by measuring the relative motion of the two media. We determine the flow direction, , of the interstellar wind through the heliosphere and its trend over an 11 yr solar cycle using Advanced Composition Explorer/Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer He+ double-coincidence pickup ion (PUI) measurements from a data set spanning 13 full orbits, with focusing cone crossings occurring between the years 1998 and 2010. We measure the flow direction by fitting a kappa function to the focusing cone signature in the count rates of He+ at the PUI cutoff measured as a function of ecliptic longitude. We determine for each three-orbit boxcar centered on the years 1999 through 2009 and find the trend of the resulting linear fit. We account for solar transients by removing measurements associated with CMEs. However, there still may be effects from compression regions, such as stream–stream and corotating interaction regions. We additionally make considerations to ensure the PUI torus is in view, to account for varying interplanetary magnetic field angles, to ensure that we analyze newly injected interstellar PUIs largely unaffected by transport effects, and to account for general solar activity. We measure a slope in the flow direction to be 0.00° ± 0.51° yr−1, indicating that we do not measure a varying trend over this period. We repeat the focusing cone analysis for the combined data set and determine an overall flow direction of 75.37° ± 0.43°.

Barium stars are peculiar stars with enhanced slow neutron capture process (s-process) elements. Abundance analysis of them aids in better understanding the chemical evolution of the Milky Way. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven method named the memory-enhanced adaptive spectral network (MEASNet) to search for barium candidates in the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) low-resolution survey (LRS) and estimate the abundance of five s-process elements: Sr, Y, Ba, Ce, and Nd. MEASNet, trained using spectra from common stars in both LAMOST and the Galactic Archaeology with HERMES survey, showcases notable performance: for the classification task, precision = 98.22% and recall = 94.12%; in prediction, the mean absolute error for the seven elements range between 0.07 and 0.15 dex. After training, we apply the model to 4,083,003 stellar spectra from LAMOST DR10 LRS, successfully identifying 1,803,670 spectra of barium candidates ([Ba/Fe] ≥ 0.25 dex) along with their five s-process elemental abundances. The catalog enlarges the sample size, providing a wealth of data for further statistical analysis of the formation and evolution of barium stars. Meanwhile, this work highlights the potential value of MEASNet in star classification and abundance estimation, offering a strong reference for future data-driven models.

Crush curves are of fundamental importance to numerical modeling of small and porous astrophysical bodies. The empirical literature often measures them for silica grains, and different studies have used various methods, sizes, textures, and pressure conditions. Here, we review past studies and supplement further experiments in order to develop a full and overarching understanding of the silica crush curve behavior. We suggest a new power-law function that can be used in impact simulations of analog materials similar to microgranular silica. We perform a benchmarking study to compare this new crush curve to the parametric quadratic crush curve often used in other studies, based on the study case of the DART impact onto the asteroid Dimorphos. We find that the typical quadratic crush curve parameters do not closely follow the silica crushing experiments, and as a consequence, they under (over) estimate compression close (far) from the impact site. The new crush curve presented here, applicable to pressures between a few hundred Pa and up to 1.1 GPa, might therefore be more precise. Additionally, it is not calibrated by case-specific parameters, and can be used universally for comet- or asteroid-like bodies, given an assumed composition similar to microgranular silica.

We examine Ulysses magnetic field observations from 1993 to 1996 as the spacecraft made its first fast-latitude scan from the southern to the northern hemisphere. Most of the observations we use are representative of high-latitude solar minimum conditions. We examine magnetic field power spectra characteristics of interplanetary turbulence at high frequencies, where the spectrum breaks from an inertial range into the ion dissipation range. The onset and spectral index of the dissipation spectrum are consistent with low-latitude observations at 1 au. Both ranges have a ratio of power in perpendicular magnetic field components to parallel components near 3. The power spectrum ratio test developed by Bieber et al. for single-spacecraft analyses that determines the underlying anisotropy of the wave vectors yields only marginally more energy associated with field-aligned wave vectors than perpendicular wave vectors when comparing the inertial and dissipation-range spectra. The lack of significant change in the anisotropies between the inertial and dissipation ranges contrasts strongly with the turbulence found typically for 1 au near-ecliptic observations, where significant differences in both anisotropies are observed.

In this paper we describe the survey design for the Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam Observations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) Cycle 1 JWST Treasury program, which executed its early imaging component in 2022 November. The UNCOVER survey includes ultradeep (∼29–30AB) imaging of ∼45 arcmin2 on and around the well-studied A2744 galaxy cluster at z = 0.308 and will follow up ∼500 galaxies with extremely deep low-resolution spectroscopy with the NIRSpec/PRISM during the summer of 2023, with repeat visits in summer 2024. We describe the science goals, survey design, target selection, and planned data releases. We also present and characterize the depths of the first NIRCam imaging mosaic, highlighting previously unparalleled resolved and ultradeep 2–4 μm imaging of known objects in the field. The UNCOVER primary NIRCam mosaic spans 28.8 arcmin2 in seven filters (F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M, and F444W) and 16.8 arcmin2 in our NIRISS parallel (F115W, F150W, F200W, F356W, and F444W). To maximize early community use of the Treasury data set, we publicly release the full reduced mosaics of public JWST imaging including 45 arcmin2 NIRCam and 17 arcmin2 NIRISS mosaics on and around the A2744 cluster, including the Hubble Frontier Field primary and parallel footprints.

该研究通过AstroSat和NICER在2017年对黑洞X射线双星源GRS 1915+105的同时观测进行了光谱-时间分析。结果表明，源表现出两个通量水平（高和低），其能谱可以用盘光子的热康普顿散射来描述。通过SXT/LAXPC和NICER/LAXPC的联合拟合获得的光谱参数是一致的。LAXPC和NICER的功率密度谱显示了一个约2赫兹的宽突出特征。这一特征的能量依赖性不能仅通过冠层光谱参数的变化来解释，而是需要一个模型来解释冠层加热速率的变化首先引起了盘温度和内半径的变化。我们的结果强调了AstroSat和NICER的同时观测的重要性，并强调了需要更复杂的模型来解释黑洞系统的光谱-时间行为。<br /><br />总结: 该研究利用AstroSat和NICER对黑洞X射线双星进行了光谱-时间分析，揭示了源的能谱和时间特性。研究结果表明，同时观测对于理解黑洞系统非常重要，并强调了需要更复杂的模型来解释这一行为。 <div>
In this study, we undertake a spectral-timing analysis of the black hole X-ray binary source GRS 1915+105 using simultaneous observations carried out by AstroSat (Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter, LAXPC and Soft X-ray Telescope, SXT) and Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) in 2017. The source showed two flux levels (high and low), whose energy spectra can be described by the thermal comptonization of disk photons. The spectral parameters obtained by the joint fitting of SXT/LAXPC and NICER/LAXPC were consistent. The power density spectra from LAXPC and NICER revealed a broad, prominent feature at ∼2 Hz. The energy dependence of the fractional rms and time lag of this feature cannot be explained by only variations of coronal spectral parameters. Instead, a model where the coronal heating rate varies first and induces a change in the disk temperature and inner radius can explain the variation. Our results underline the importance of simultaneous observations by AstroSat and NICER and highlight the need for more sophisticated models to explain the spectral-temporal behavior of black hole systems.

总结: <br /><br />该研究报告了对选定的明亮活动星系核进行的回响映射(RM)观测活动，旨在通过极大望远镜干涉仪上的GRAVITY仪器进行光谱测量，以充分监测其预期较大的广谱线区域(BLR)的大小。我们对五个对象IC 4329A、Mrk 335、Mrk 509、Mrk 1239和PDS 456的首次结果进行了报告，并且首次对Mrk 1239和PDS 456进行了光谱监测。我们获得了多年的监测数据，并进行了多组分光谱分解，以提取宽Hβ轮廓。我们检测到Hβ和连续变化之间存在显著的时间延迟，总体上与先前建立的BLR大小 - 亮度关系相吻合。速度分辨的Hβ时间延迟揭示了多样化的、可能是进化的BLR动力学。我们还从均值和rms光谱中测量了Hβ线宽，由此得到的毗律产品在不同观测季节之间表现出良好的一致性。采用统一的毗律因子和mean光谱中宽Hβ线的FWHM作为速度的度量，得到的黑洞质量分别为，，，和。我们还报告了使用其他线宽度度量方法进行的黑洞质量估算。对于之前进行过RM活动的对象，我们的质量估计与早先的结果一致。在附带的论文中，我们将使用BLR动力学建模来直接推测黑洞质量，从而确定毗律因子。 <div>
We conduct a reverberation mapping (RM) campaign to spectroscopically monitor a sample of selected bright active galactic nuclei with large anticipated broad-line region (BLR) sizes adequate for spectroastrometric (SA) observations by the GRAVITY instrument on the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. We report the first results for five objects, IC 4329A, Mrk 335, Mrk 509, Mrk 1239, and PDS 456, among which Mrk 1239 and PDS 456 are for the first time spectroscopically monitored. We obtain multiyear monitoring data and perform multicomponent spectral decomposition to extract the broad Hβ profiles. We detect significant time lags between the Hβ and continuum variations, generally obeying the previously established BLR size–luminosity relation. Velocity-resolved Hβ time lags illustrate diverse, possibly evolving, BLR kinematics. We further measure the Hβ line widths from mean and rms spectra and the resulting virial products show good consistency among different observing seasons. Adopting a unity virial factor and the FWHM of the broad Hβ line from the mean spectra as a measure of velocity, the obtained black hole masses averaged over seasons are , , , , and for the five objects, respectively. Black hole mass estimations using other line width measures are also reported. For objects with previous RM campaigns, our mass estimates are in agreement with earlier results. In a companion paper, we will employ BLR dynamical modeling to directly infer the black hole mass and thereby determine the virial factors.

这篇文章研究了来自遥远星系核的一些电磁突发现象，发现其在几个月至几年的时间尺度上重复，并且每个源都可以由超大质量黑洞周围的重复潮汐撕裂产生的吸积耀斑而来。研究通过分析估计和流体力学模拟，测试了rpTDE模型，发现高质量（≳1M⊙）演化恒星可以在与SMBH的多次碰撞中存活，并且几乎不损失质量，从而产生近乎相同振幅的定期吸积耀斑，这与ASASSN-14ko的表现相符。此外，星体受到潮汐力传递的能量可以导致其轨道周期的变化，这与ASASSN-14ko吸积耀斑重现时间的观测衰减相当。相反，低质量和未演化的恒星在相同近日点距离下会逐渐损失更多质量，从而产生更明亮的吸积耀斑，导致星体迅速毁灭和耀斑停止。这也说明了重复瞬变的光变曲线与恒星类型密切相关。总结：研究发现重复瞬变的光变曲线与恒星类型密切相关，高质量演化恒星能够产生近乎相同振幅的定期吸积耀斑，而低质量未演化的恒星则会产生更明亮的吸积耀斑并迅速毁灭。 <div>
Some electromagnetic outbursts from the nuclei of distant galaxies have been found to repeat on months-to-years timescales, and each of these sources can putatively arise from the accretion flares generated through the repeated tidal stripping of a star on a bound orbit about a supermassive black hole (SMBH), i.e., a repeating partial tidal disruption event (rpTDE). Here, we test the rpTDE model through analytical estimates and hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction between a range of stars, which differ from one another in mass and age, and an SMBH. We show that higher-mass (≳1M⊙), evolved stars can survive many (≳10−100) encounters with an SMBH while simultaneously losing few × 0.01M⊙, resulting in accretion flares that are approximately evenly spaced in time with nearly the same amplitude, quantitatively reproducing ASASSN-14ko. We also show that the energy imparted to the star via tides can lead to a change in its orbital period that is comparable to the observed decay in the recurrence time of ASASSN-14ko’s flares, . Contrarily, lower-mass and less-evolved stars lose progressively more mass and produce brighter accretion flares on subsequent encounters for the same pericenter distances, leading to the rapid destruction of the star and cessation of flares. Such systems cannot reproduce ASASSN-14ko-like transients, but are promising candidates for recreating events such as AT2020vdq, which displayed a second and much brighter outburst compared to the first. Our results imply that the lightcurves of repeating transients are tightly coupled with stellar type.

在这篇文章中，研究人员对附近星系的形状进行了深入分析，使用了前向建模方法来克服先前研究中的局限性，并且对比了观测结果和宇宙学模拟。他们发现TNG50模拟和HSC-SSP观测之间的卓越一致性挑战了先前的观点，即ΛCDM模型低估了薄星系的丰度。尤其是在星等小于10^9.5的星系中，观测和模拟之间的张力小于0.1σ，与先前报告的张力大于10σ形成鲜明对比。研究人员还发现，TNG50模拟中的低质量星系比HSC-SSP观测中的对应星系更加厚实，这被归因于虚假的动力学加热效应人为膨胀了星系。此外，他们还发现，尽管整体上存在广泛的一致性，TNG50模拟中的星系在低质量和高质量端更加集中，在中等质量范围内则较少集中。然而，研究人员认为低质量TNG50星系的较高集中度不太可能是它们更厚/更圆外观的原因。这项研究强调了进行模拟的模拟观测和应用一致的测量方法的重要性，以便与观测进行适当的比较。<br /><br />总结: 研究表明TNG50模拟中的星系形状与HSC-SSP观测结果有很好的一致性，挑战了先前的观点；模拟中的低质量星系比观测更厚实，这归因于虚假的动力学加热效应；整体上存在一致性，但在不同质量范围中有一些差异；对模拟进行模拟观测和应用一致的测量方法是很重要的。 <div>
We perform a thorough analysis of the projected shapes of nearby galaxies in both observations and cosmological simulations. We implement a forward-modeling approach to overcome the limitations in previous studies, which hinder accurate comparisons between observations and simulations. We measure axis ratios of z = 0 (snapshot 99) TNG50 galaxies from their synthetic Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) images and compare them with those obtained from real HSC-SSP images of a matched galaxy sample. Remarkably, the comparison shows excellent agreement between the observations and the TNG50 simulation, challenging previous claims that ΛCDM models underproduced the abundance of thin galaxies. Specifically, for galaxies with stellar masses , we find ≲0.1σ tensions between the observations and the simulation, a stark contrast to the previously reported ≳10σ tensions. We reveal that low-mass galaxies (M⋆ ≲ 109.5) in TNG50 are thicker than their observed counterparts in HSC-SSP and attribute this to the spurious dynamical heating effects that artificially puff up galaxies. We also find that, despite the overall broad agreement, TNG50 galaxies are more concentrated than the HSC-SSP ones at the low- and high-mass end of the stellar mass range of and are less concentrated at intermediate stellar masses. But we argue that the higher concentrations of the low-mass TNG50 galaxies are not likely the cause of their thicker/rounder appearances. Our study underscores the critical importance of conducting mock observations of simulations and applying consistent measurement methodologies to facilitate proper comparison with observations.

总结: 该研究使用Keck Cosmic Web Imager光谱观测了Leo P、Sextans A和WLM等附近矮星系中的三颗O型恒星，发现它们的基本恒星特性和辐射驱动风具有一些与当前恒星演化模型不符的现象。研究强调了在极低金属丰度下验证恒星质量、温度和光度之间的关系的重要性，以及未来针对金属贫乏恒星群体的质量损失和演化模型的发展。总的来说，这些发现为未来研究提供了实证基准。 <br /> <div>
Metal-poor massive stars drive the evolution of low-mass galaxies, both locally and at high redshift. However, quantifying the feedback they impart to their local surroundings remains uncertain because models of stellar evolution, mass loss, and ionizing spectra are unconstrained by observations below 20% solar metallicity (Z⊙). We present new Keck Cosmic Web Imager optical spectroscopy of three O-type stars in the nearby dwarf galaxies Leo P, Sextans A, and WLM, which have gas-phase oxygen abundances of 3%–14% Z⊙. To characterize their fundamental stellar properties and radiation-driven winds, we fit PoWR atmosphere models to the optical spectra simultaneously with Hubble Space Telescope far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra and multiwavelength photometry. We find that all three stars have effective temperatures consistent with their spectral types and surface gravities typical of main-sequence dwarf stars. Yet, the combination of those inferred parameters and luminosity for the two lower-Z stars is not reproduced by stellar evolution models, even those that include rotation or binary interactions. The scenario of multiple-star systems is difficult to reconcile with all available data, suggesting that these observations pose a challenge to current evolution models. We highlight the importance of validating the relationship between stellar mass, temperature, and luminosity at very low Z for accurate estimates of ionizing photon production and spectral hardness. Finally, all three stars’ FUV wind profiles reveal low mass-loss rates and terminal wind velocities in tension with expectations from widely adopted radiation-driven wind models. These results provide empirical benchmarks for future development of mass-loss and evolution models for metal-poor stellar populations.

<div> 高红移活跃星系核AGN, 复电离, JWST, 空间密度, 宇宙再电离<br /> 

在过去，高红移活跃星系核（AGN）曾被认为在复电离中扮演较小的角色，尽管Chandra和哈勃空间望远镜初期的证据支持它们在低亮度下的大空间密度。然而，最近JWST的观测发现在红移大于4时有相当数量的暗淡AGN，这确实证实了早期的研究结果。研究人员展示了红移约为5的AGN样本，这些样本来自于广泛的、浅层的地面调查和来自JWST的深层、铅笔光束观测，这使我们能够以前所未有的精度估计它们的空间密度。在红移约为5时，AGN亮度函数的亮端（M1450 < -26）已经得到了很好的限制，斜率相当陡峭。暗端（M1450 ≥ -22）表明有很高的空间密度，而波动很大，拐点（M1450 ~ -24）大部分尚未确定。与最先进的模型进行比较发现，在红移为5时，观测到的AGN亮度函数与预期的相当一致，而在更高红移时，预测的空间密度演化速度似乎过快。考虑到暗端的大方差，我们在拟合亮度函数和推导电离发射率时考虑了不同的选项。即使在最保守的情景中，红移约为5的AGN产生的光电离率也与紫外背景辐射的测量结果一致。观察到暗淡AGN空间密度的缓慢演化表明，活跃超大质量黑洞可能在红移大于6时不断产生大量的电离光子，远远超出再电离纪元。这是一个重要的指示，即高红移AGN可能是宇宙再电离的主要贡献者。<br /><br />总结: 过去高z AGN在再电离中的作用被低估，但JWST的观测证实了它们在红移大于4时的大量存在。红移约为5的AGN亮度函数显示出明显的斜率和高空间密度，而对比现代模型也有相当一致性。活跃超大质量黑洞可能在红移大于6时持续产生大量的电离光子，对宇宙再电离产生重要影响。 <div>
In the past, high-z active galactic nuclei (AGNs) were given a minor role as possible drivers of reionization, despite initial evidence in favor of their large space densities at low luminosities by Chandra and the Hubble Space Telescope. Recent observations from JWST are finding relatively large numbers of faint AGNs at z > 4, convincingly confirming these early results. We present a sample of z ∼ 5 AGNs, both from wide, shallow ground-based surveys and from deep, pencil-beam observations from JWST, allowing us to estimate their space densities with unprecedented accuracy. The bright end (M1450 < −26) of the z ∼ 5 AGN luminosity function is well constrained, with a rather steep slope. The faint end (M1450 ≥ −22) indicates a high space density, the scatter is significant, and the knee (M1450 ∼ −24) is mostly undetermined. Comparisons with state-of-the-art models find reasonable agreement with the observed AGN luminosity function at z = 5, while the predicted space density evolution at higher redshifts appears to be too fast with respect to observational constraints. Given the large variance at the faint end, we consider different options in fitting the luminosity functions and deriving the ionizing emissivity. Even in the most conservative scenario, the photoionization rate produced by z ∼ 5 AGNs is consistent with the ultraviolet background measurements. A slow evolution of the space density of faint AGNs is observed, indicating that active SMBHs are probably producing large amounts of ionizing photons at z > 6, well into the Epoch of Reionization. This is an important indication that high-z AGNs could be major contributors to the reionization of the Universe.

总结: 该研究报道了在Herbig Ae星MWC 480周围的盘中探测到了二甲醚（CH3OCH3），这是在非过渡性II类盘中首次发现CH3OCH3。观测显示CH3OCH3呈紧凑、未解析状态，半径≲25天文单位，线宽≈30 km/s，激发温度≈200 K，表明COMs在暖内盘中升华。尽管探测到了CH3OCH3，但并未探测到CH3OH，这导致了CH3OCH3/CH3OH的列密度比约为7。这一高比值表明在盘相阶段COMs发生重加工，以及内盘物理结构的影响。该研究还发现，这一比值高于最近发现的富含COMs的过渡盘。这可能表明在MWC 480的全盘中，COMs在内部经历了显著的化学重加工，而过渡盘中的COM发射主要跟踪了位于较大半径（≳20 au）的灰尘空洞边缘的继承冰的升华。 <br /><br /> <div>
Characterizing the chemistry of complex organic molecules (COMs) at the epoch of planet formation provides insights into the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM) and the origin of organic materials in our solar system. We report a detection of dimethyl ether (CH3OCH3) in the disk around the Herbig Ae star MWC 480 with sensitive Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations. This is the first detection of CH3OCH3 in a nontransitional Class II disk. The spatially unresolved, compact (≲25 au in radius) nature, broad line width (∼30 km s−1), and high excitation temperature (∼200 K) indicate the sublimation of COMs in the warm inner disk. Despite the detection of CH3OCH3, methanol (CH3OH), the most abundant COM in the ISM, has not been detected, from which we constrain the column density ratio of CH3OCH3/CH3OH ≳ 7. This high ratio may indicate the reprocessing of COMs during the disk phase, as well as the effect of the physical structure in the inner disk. We also find that this ratio is higher than in COM-rich transition disks recently discovered. This may indicate that in the full disk of MWC 480, COMs have experienced substantial chemical reprocessing in the innermost region, while the COM emission in the transition disks predominantly traces the inherited ice sublimating at the dust cavity edge located at larger radii (≳20 au).

这篇文章研究了3C 264的NuSTAR探测结果，以及Chandra和Swift的观测数据。研究发现，3C 264的硬X射线可能主要来自未解析的X射线核心，这表明射流可能与RIAF共同贡献了X射线。通过康普顿化模型分析，发现3C 264的电子温度约为15 keV，光学深度在4到7之间，符合黑洞吸积的冠层特性普遍性。此外，研究还发现3C 264的截断能量或电子温度是其他低亮度活跃星系核中最低的。研究还指出，观测到的硬X射线辐射至少比用来解释γ射线和TeV辐射的自缩一致辐射模型预测的辐射高一个数量级，这可能意味着同步辐射电子的加速能力高于先前的预期。 <br /><br />总结: <br />3C 264的NuSTAR探测结果显示，硬X射线可能来自未解析的X射线核心，表明射流和RIAF共同贡献了X射线。康普顿化模型分析发现电子温度约为15 keV，光学深度在4到7之间，辐射特性普遍。同时，3C 264的截断能量或电子温度是其他低亮度活跃星系核中最低的，而观测到的硬X射线辐射高于先前的预期。 <div>
3C 264 is one of the few FRI radio galaxies with detected TeV emission. It is a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN) and is generally associated with a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF). Earlier multiwavelength studies suggest that the X-ray emission originates from a jet. However, the possibility that the RIAF can significantly contribute to the X-rays cannot be ruled out. In particular, hard X-ray emission ≳10 keV has never been detected, making it challenging to distinguish between X-ray models. Here we report a NuSTAR detection up to 25 keV from 3C 264. We also present subpixel deconvolved Chandra images to resolve jet emission down to ∼0.″2 from the center of the unresolved X-ray core. Together with a simultaneous Swift observation, we have constrained the dominant hard X-ray emission to be from its unresolved X-ray core, presumably in its quiescent state. We found evidence of a cutoff in the energy around 20 keV, indicating that at least some of the X-rays from the core can be attributed to the RIAF. The Comptonization model suggests an electron temperature of about 15 keV and an optical depth ranging between 4 and 7, following the universality of coronal properties of black hole accretion. The cutoff energy or electron temperature of 3C 264 is the lowest among those of other LLAGNs. The detected hard X-ray emission is at least an order of magnitude higher than that predicted by synchrotron self-Compton models introduced to explain γ-ray and TeV emission, suggesting that the synchrotron electrons might be accelerated to higher energies than previously thought.

Our investigation concentrates on the heartbeat-like variability in the X-ray emission, with the aim of using it as a tool to unravel the origin of the nonthermal emission during the heartbeat state. Through X-ray timing and spectral analysis, we observe that the heartbeat-like variability correlates with changes in the disk temperature, supporting the disk radiation pressure instability scenario. Moreover, in addition to a Comptonization component, our time-averaged and phase-resolved spectroscopy reveal the presence of a power-law component that varies independently from the disk component. Combined with the radio–X-ray spectral energy distribution fitting, our results suggest that the power-law component could originate from synchrotron self-Compton radiation in the jet, which requires a strong magnetic field of about B = (0.3–3.5) × 106 G. Additionally, assuming that IGR J17091-3624 and GRS 1915 + 105 share the same radio–X-ray correlation coefficient during both the hard and the heartbeat states, we obtain a distance of 13.7 ± 2.3 kpc for IGR J17091–3624.

Asteroseismic modeling is a powerful way to derive stellar properties. However, the derived quantities are limited by built-in assumptions used in stellar models. This work presents a detailed characterization of stellar model uncertainties in asteroseismic red giants, focusing on the mixing-length parameter αMLT, the initial helium fraction Yinit, the solar abundance scale, and the overshoot parameters. First, we estimate error floors due to model uncertainties to be ≈0.4% in mass, ≈0.2% in radius, and ≈17% in age, primarily due to the uncertain state of αMLT and Yinit. The systematic uncertainties in age exceed typical statistical uncertainties, suggesting the importance of their evaluation in asteroseismic applications. Second, we demonstrate that the uncertainties from αMLT can be entirely mitigated by direct radius measurements or partially through . Utilizing radii from Kepler eclipsing binaries, we determined the αMLT values and calibrated the αMLT–[M/H] relation. The correlation observed between the two variables is positive, consistent with previous studies using 1D stellar models, but in contrast with outcomes from 3D simulations. Third, we explore the implications of using asteroseismic modeling to test the scaling relation. We found that a perceived dependency of on [M/H] from individual frequency modeling can be largely removed by incorporating the calibrated αMLT–[M/H] relation. Variations in Yinit can also affect predictions. These findings suggest that conveys information not fully captured by individual frequencies, and that it should be carefully considered as an important observable for asteroseismic modeling.

<div> 关键词：活动星系核、TeV宇宙射线、超大质量黑洞、磁化湍流、中微子产生

总结:<br /><br />
本文研究了活动星系核作为潜在加速器的可能性，以及其产生的高能中微子。通过NGC 1068活动星系核发出的TeV中微子信号的证据，确认了这一观点，但关于宇宙射线加速的位置和机制仍存在疑问。研究表明，环绕中心超大质量黑洞的磁化湍流可能是宇宙射线加速的候选地点。最新的磁化湍流的粒子-电磁场模拟显示，随机宇宙射线加速是非共振的，与之前的研究假设不同。这对于自洽的活动星系核中微子产生理论有着重要影响，导致比之前认为的更快的宇宙射线加速。磁场湍流的波动和涡旋能量密度高于等于1%的重量能密度，能够解释NGC 1068中微子流的归一化，以及中微子的能谱形状。在这个框架内，只有一部分质子在活动星系核中被加速到高能。因此，NGC 1068中微子信号为磁化湍流中的粒子加速提供了一个检验基础。 <div>
The cores of active galactic nuclei are potential accelerators of 10–100 TeV cosmic rays, in turn producing high-energy neutrinos. This picture was confirmed by the compelling evidence of a TeV neutrino signal from the nearby active galaxy NGC 1068, leaving open the question of what is the site and mechanism of cosmic-ray acceleration. One candidate is the magnetized turbulence surrounding the central supermassive black hole. Recent particle-in-cell simulations of magnetized turbulence indicate that stochastic cosmic-ray acceleration is nonresonant, in contrast to the assumptions of previous studies. We show that this has important consequences on a self-consistent theory of neutrino production in the corona, leading to a more rapid cosmic-ray acceleration than previously considered. The turbulent magnetic-field fluctuations needed to explain the neutrino signal are consistent with a magnetically powered corona. We find that strong turbulence, with turbulent magnetic energy density higher than 1% of the rest-mass energy density, naturally explains the normalization of the IceCube neutrino flux, in addition to the neutrino spectral shape. Only a fraction of the protons in the corona, which can be directly inferred from the neutrino signal, are accelerated to high energies. Thus, in this framework, the neutrino signal from NGC 1068 provides a testbed for particle acceleration in magnetized turbulence.

磁重连接模拟结果显示，伴随着电子和质子的加热和能量增加，两种粒子形成了延伸近三个数量级能量的幂律分布。非热粒子的主要驱动机制是Fermi反射，在不断演变和合并的磁通绳内发生。尽管两种粒子的幂律指数相近，但质子的总能量增加比电子更多，并且它们的幂律延伸到更高能量。在低能量处，幂律分布转变为热分布，对于电子来说，转变能量比质子更低。强引导场通过减少Fermi驱动机制来减少非热粒子的产生。太阳耀斑中，质子的幂律分布应当延展到几十千电子伏特，远低于直接观测得到的能量。因此，质子应当携带比直接观测到的能量更多的磁能。 <br /><br />总结: 研究发现在磁重连接中产生了延伸近三个数量级能量的幂律分布的非热电子和质子，其中质子的能量增加更多，并且幂律分布延伸到更高能量。同时，强引导场能减少非热粒子的产生。在太阳耀斑中，质子应当携带比直接观测到的能量更多的磁能。 <div>
The results of simulations of magnetic reconnection accompanied by electron and proton heating and energization in a macroscale system are presented. Both species form extended power-law distributions that extend nearly three decades in energy. The primary drive mechanism for the production of these nonthermal particles is Fermi reflection within evolving and coalescing magnetic flux ropes. While the power-law indices of the two species are comparable, the protons overall gain more energy than electrons, and their power law extends to higher energy. The power laws roll into a hot thermal distribution at low energy with the transition energy occurring at lower energy for electrons compared with protons. A strong guide field diminishes the production of nonthermal particles by reducing the Fermi drive mechanism. In solar flares, proton power laws should extend down to tens of keV, far below the energies that can be directly probed via gamma-ray emission. Thus, protons should carry much more of the released magnetic energy than expected from direct observations.

Cyclopropenethione falls into the class of complex organic molecules but has not yet been observed in the interstellar medium or any circumstellar disks. However, its existence is very likely, and thus this study provides high-level ab initio predictions, which may serve as reference data for future observations or experimental work. Rovibrational configuration interaction theory based on multidimensional potential energy surfaces being obtained from explicitly correlated coupled-cluster calculations has been used to predict the fundamental vibrational modes, the microwave spectrum, and low-lying rovibrational transitions. Rotational constants as well as quartic and sextic centrifugal distortion constants were obtained from vibrational perturbation theory.

<div> Roche lobe overflow, low-mass star, supermassive black hole, tidal disruption events, multimessenger
总结:<br /><br />本文讨论了来自一个近乎圆形轨道上的一个低质量恒星向一个超大质量黑洞(RLO)的洪流。如果质量转移是不稳定的，那么其速率会在一个失控的过程中加速，结果会产生超Eddington质量吸积速率的辐射，伴随着从超大质量黑洞附近发出的光学/紫外线强光流。这会产生一个持续1-4周的明亮光学/紫外线耀斑，伴随着来自超大质量黑洞的吸积流的持续1-10年的X射线前体和后体。这种“循环潮汐破碎事件”(TDEs)代表了一类新的核瞬变现象，以至多占到了经典拖拽破碎事件速率的1%–10%。在破碎之前，近乎崩溃的旋转和强大的潮汐变形可能导致强大的磁场，使得循环TDEs成为射流TDEs可能的前体。破碎前的流出产生了一个约0.01-0.1 pc距离处约为10^-2 M⊙的星系核环境(CNM)，可能导致明亮的射电辐射，并且也类似于射流TDEs所推断的CNM。我们讨论了循环TDEs和其他最近确定的与星系核相关的瞬变事件类别之间的更广泛的联系，比如重复TDEs和准周期性X射线喷发，以及与AT2018cow等明亮快速蓝光瞬变事件可能的联系。我们还讨论了白矮星环绕中质量黑洞的类似RLO的观测特征，这可能是LISA时代的多信使源。 <div>
We consider Roche lobe overflow (RLO) from a low-mass star on a nearly circular orbit, onto a supermassive black hole (SMBH). If mass transfer is unstable, its rate accelerates in a runaway process, resulting in highly super-Eddington mass accretion rates, accompanied by an optically thick outflow emanating from the SMBH vicinity. This produces a 1–4 week long, bright optical/ultraviolet flare, accompanied by a 1–10 year long X-ray precursor and post-cursor emitted from the accretion flow onto the SMBH. Such “Circular Tidal Disruption Events” (TDEs) represent a new class of nuclear transients, occurring at up to 1%–10% of the canonical parabolic tidal disruption event rate. Near-breakup rotation and strong tidal deformation of the star prior to disruption could lead to strong magnetic fields, making circular TDEs possible progenitors of jetted TDEs. Outflows prior to the final stellar disruption produce a circumnuclear environment (CNM) with ∼10−2 M⊙ at distances of ∼0.01–0.1 pc, likely leading to bright radio emission, and also similar to the CNM inferred for jetted TDEs. We discuss broader connections between circular TDEs and other recently identified classes of transients associated with galactic nuclei, such as repeating TDEs and quasi-periodic X-ray eruptions, as well as possible connections to luminous fast blue optical transients such as AT2018cow. We also discuss observational signatures of the analogous RLO of a white dwarf around an intermediate-mass BH, which may be a multimessenger source in the LISA era.

总结:<br />
本文通过对18个高吸积率mBH（MBH ∼ 106M⊙）驱动的AGN的研究，发现了一个有趣的倾向，即X射线较弱的mBH倾向于具有更大的LR/LX值。这与X射线可能被“苗条”吸积盘遮挡的情景一致。作者比较了此观察结果与弱发射线类星体的结果，并建议这个结果可能为寻找高吸积率AGN提供了一个新的观测特征。 <div>
The supermassive black holes (MBH ∼ 106–1010M⊙) that power luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs), i.e., quasars, generally show a correlation between thermal disk emission in the ultraviolet (UV) and coronal emission in hard X-rays. In contrast, some “massive” black holes (mBHs; MBH ∼ 105–106M⊙) in low-mass galaxies present curious X-ray properties with coronal radiative output up to 100× weaker than expected. To examine this issue, we present a pilot study incorporating Very Large Array radio observations of a sample of 18 high-accretion-rate (Eddington ratios Lbol/LEdd > 0.1), mBH-powered AGNs (MBH ∼ 106M⊙) with Chandra X-ray coverage. Empirical correlations previously revealed in samples of radio-quiet, high-Eddington AGNs indicate that the radio–X-ray luminosity ratio, LR/LX, is approximately constant. Through multiwavelength analysis, we instead find that the X-ray-weaker mBHs in our sample tend toward larger values of LR/LX even though they remain radio-quiet per their optical–UV properties. This trend results in a tentative but highly intriguing correlation between LR/LX and X-ray weakness, which we argue is consistent with a scenario in which X-rays may be preferentially obscured from our line of sight by a “slim” accretion disk. We compare this observation to weak emission-line quasars (AGNs with exceptionally weak broad-line emission and a significant X-ray-weak fraction) and conclude by suggesting that our results may offer a new observational signature for finding high-accretion-rate AGNs.

总结:
本研究使用了SOFIA和HST联合观测了NGC 2071 IR区域，对HOPS 361-A原恒星的流出现象进行了研究。通过SOFIA测量了新的[O I] 63μm光谱，可以跟踪流出现象、分辨光谱线轮廓、给出辐射速度，进而得到3D动力学、激波特性和反馈特性。HST的正确运动和灭光值提供了更完整的准3D图像，用于建立激波速度和密度模型。研究发现14个显示正确运动的明显特征。结合SOFIA数据，估计HOPS 361-A的质量流出率为3.16×10^-6M⊙ yr^-1，激波速度最高可达51 km s^-1。根据所有节，得到的流出力每面积单位为1.45 × 10^-4M⊙ km^-1 s^-1 yr^-1，能量每面积单位为2.37 × 10^-2M⊙ s^-3，假定为恒定，反馈值存在较大不确定性。使用所有SOFIA光圈包围HOPS 361的总[O I]亮度为0.7 L⊙，相当于质量流出率为7×10^-5M⊙ yr^-1。这是NGC 2071 IR区域在近、远红外区域进行的第二次3D动力学研究，SOFIA的[O I]光谱为连接HOPS 361-A最近一次流出事件、流出洞和周围NGC 2071 IR形成环境的参与气体提供了独特的聚焦。 <div>
We present a combined Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) and two-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) study of the region NGC 2071 IR containing the outflow from the protostar HOPS 361-A (NGC 2071 IRS 1). New [O i] 63 μm spectra, taken with the German REciever for Astronomy at Terahertz frequencies (GREAT) instrument aboard SOFIA, trace the outflow, spectrally resolve line profiles, and give radial velocities of the far-IR emission to yield 3D kinematics, shock properties, and feedback properties. Proper motions and extinction values from HST give a more complete quasi-3D picture that we use to model shock speeds and densities. We identify 14 distinct features that show proper motions. Combined with the GREAT data, we estimate that HOPS 361-A has a mass outflow rate of 3.16 × 10−6M⊙ yr−1 with shock speeds up to 51 km s−1. The outflow force summed over all knots per area is measured to be 1.45 × 10−4M⊙ km−1 s−1 yr−1 and a power summed over all knotsper area of 2.37 × 10−2M⊙ s−3 dissipated assuming constant , with large uncertainties on the feedback values. The total [O i] luminosity using all SOFIA apertures encompassing the HOPS 361 clump is 0.7 L⊙, corresponding to a mass outflow rate of 7 × 10−5M⊙ yr−1. This is the second 3D kinematic study of an outflow in NGC 2071 IR in the near- and far-IR regimes following Rubinstein et al. (2023). The SOFIA [O i] spectra add unique focus to the entrained gas connecting the recent episode of outflows from HOPS 361-A to the outflow cavity and the surrounding NGC 2071 IR star-forming environment.

<br />总结:
本文研究了MGRO J1908+06在GeV-TeV能量范围内的γ射线发射的起源。通过分析Fermi大面积望远镜、Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System和High Altitude Water Cherenkov收集的数据，并加入之前LHAASO报告的谱数据，对MGRO J1908+06的形态和光谱特征进行了多波段研究，揭示了γ射线发射的起源。通过详细的宽带建模，限制了磁场强度、源年龄和距离，研究了明亮TeV射线的机制。光谱形状和能量相关形态均支持逆康普顿辐射假说，这种辐射由与PSR J1907+0602相关的演化脉冲星风星云产生，真实年龄T= 22±9千年，磁场B= 5.4±0.8μG，假设脉冲星距离dPSR = 3.2kpc。 <div>
This paper investigates the origin of the γ-ray emission from MGRO J1908+06 in the GeV–TeV energy band. By analyzing the data collected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope, the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System, and High Altitude Water Cherenkov, with the addition of spectral data previously reported by LHAASO, a multiwavelength study of the morphological and spectral features of MGRO J1908+06 provides insight into the origin of the γ-ray emission. The mechanism behind the bright TeV emission is studied by constraining the magnetic field strength, the source age, and the distance through detailed broadband modeling. Both spectral shape and energy-dependent morphology support the scenario that inverse Compton emission of an evolved pulsar wind nebula associated with PSR J1907+0602 is responsible for the MGRO J1908+06 γ-ray emission with a best-fit true age of T = 22 ± 9 kyr and a magnetic field of B = 5.4 ± 0.8 μG, assuming the distance to the pulsar dPSR = 3.2 kpc.

PG 1448+273 is a luminous, nearby (z = 0.0645), narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy, which likely accretes close to the Eddington limit. Previous X-ray observations of PG 1448+273 with XMM-Newton in 2017 and NuSTAR in 2022 revealed the presence of an ultrafast outflow, as seen through its blueshifted iron (Fe) K absorption profile, where the outflow velocity appeared to vary in the range 0.1−0.3c. In this work, new X-ray observations of PG 1448+273 are presented, in the form of four simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations performed in 2023 July and August. The X-ray spectra appeared at a similar flux in each observation, making it possible to analyze the mean 2023 X-ray spectrum at high signal-to-noise ratio. A broad (σ = 1 keV) and highly blueshifted (E = 9.8 ± 0.4 keV) Fe K absorption profile is revealed in the mean spectrum. The profile can be modeled by a fast, geometrically thick accretion disk wind, which reveals a maximum terminal velocity of v∞ = −0.43 ± 0.03c, one of the fastest known winds in a nearby active galactic nucleus. As a result, the inferred mass outflow rate of the wind may reach a significant fraction of the Eddington accretion rate.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了chianti数据库和软件包的第11版，主要介绍了增加的离子平衡模型对太阳过渡区的影响，以及新的原子模型对UV强线辐射的预测和实际观测结果的比较。新模型对于研究过渡区以及高密度天体和实验室等等方面都有更好的适用性。此外，还介绍了更新和添加的离子数据集以及辐射复合能量损失率的更新。 <div>
Version 11 of the chianti database and software package is presented. Advanced ionization equilibrium models have been added for low charge states of seven elements (C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, and S), and represent a significant improvement especially when modeling the solar transition region. The models include the effects of higher electron density and charge transfer on ionization and recombination rates. As an illustration of the difference these models make, a synthetic spectrum is calculated for an electron pressure of 7 × 1015 cm−3 K and compared with an active region observation from HRTS. Increases are seen in factors of 2–5 in the predicted radiances of the strongest lines in the UV from Si iv, C iv, and N v, compared to the previous modeling using the coronal approximation. Much better agreement (within 20%) with the observations is found for the majority of the lines. The new atomic models better equip both those who are studying the transition region and those who are interpreting the emission from higher-density astrophysical and laboratory plasma. In addition to the advanced models, several ion data sets have been added or updated, and data for the radiative recombination energy loss rate have been updated.

<br />
使用Dark Energy Camera (DECam) 在CTIO Blanco 4m 望远镜上进行了大麦哲伦星云 (LMC) 的新发射线调查，使用窄带Hα和[S ii]滤光片，以及一个连续波段来创建纯发射线图像。我们将这项新调查称为DeMCELS，以区别于早期的大麦哲伦星云发射线调查 (MCELS)。DeMCELS覆盖约54平方度，包括LMC的大部分明亮光学盘。由于DECam的像素大小仅为0.″27，我们的DeMCELS调查在分辨率上改进了3-5倍，与MCELS的深度相当，Hα和[S ii]的表面亮度限制分别为和。DeMCELS提供了关于各种尺度的星云的详细形态信息，从最大的超级泡沫到单个H ii区和超新星遗迹，再到包围单个恒星的发射气泡，甚至是LMC的弥散电离气体中的微弱结构。许多复杂的发射区域显示出[S ii] / Hα比值的显着变化，这表明了来自恒星风和/或超新星的冲击与嵌入式热年轻恒星的光电离的混合。我们介绍了这项调查的观测策略和数据处理的细节，并展示了与先前数据的比较结果。小麦哲伦星云的相关项目正在进行中，将另行报告。我们通过NOIRLab的数据实验室网站向整个社区提供这些新数据。 <div>
We have used the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the CTIO Blanco 4 m telescope to perform a new emission-line survey of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using narrowband Hα and [S ii] filters in addition to a continuum band to create pure emission-line images. We refer to this new survey as DeMCELS, to distinguish it from the earlier Magellanic Cloud Emission-line Survey (MCELS). DeMCELS covers ∼54 deg2, encompassing most of the bright optical disk of the LMC. With DECam's pixel size of only 0.″27, our DeMCELS survey provides a seeing-limited improvement of 3–5 times over MCELS and is comparable in depth, with surface brightness limits of and in Hα and [S ii], respectively. DeMCELS provides detailed morphological information on nebulae of all scales, from the largest supershells to individual H ii regions and supernova remnants, to bubbles of emission surrounding individual stars, and even to faint structures in the diffuse ionized gas of the LMC. Many complex regions of emission show significant variations in the ratio of [S ii] to Hα—a sign of a mixture of shocks from stellar winds and/or supernovae with photoionization by embedded hot, young stars. We present the details of the observing strategy and data processing for this survey, and show selected results in comparison with previous data. A companion project for the Small Magellanic Cloud is in progress and will be reported separately. We are making these new data available to the community at large via NOIRLab’s Data Lab site.

<br /><br />
检测到来自银河系球状星团的射电爆发，使用了实时瞬变检测和定位系统realfast。这些脉冲信号在Karl G. Jansky非常大阵列的调查中被同时探测，该调查主要关注无法识别的Fermi γ射线源。通过realfast快速采样成像，将这些爆发定位到亚角秒的精度。Green Bank射电望远镜的跟踪观测发现了来自同一源的额外射电爆发。这些爆发在搜索480秒周期时并未显示出周期性，线偏振度接近100%，圆偏振度可达12%，且展现出数月时间尺度上的可变散射。realfast定位将这一源与Fermi γ射线源牢固地联系在一起，并将其放置在（尽管不是重合于）XMM-Newton X射线源附近。基于该源的整体特性，我们讨论了这一对象的各种性质，并提出它可能是一颗年轻的脉冲星、磁星或双脉冲星系统。 
<br /><br />总结: 检测到银河系球状星团的射电爆发，使用realfast系统定位精确，以及通过Green Bank望远镜的跟踪观测验证。这些爆发未显示出周期性，表现出不同程度的偏振和可变的散射。并且通过realfast定位得知此源与Fermi γ射线源相关，可能为年轻的脉冲星、磁星或双脉冲星系统。 <div>
We report on the detection of radio bursts from the Galactic bulge using the real-time transient detection and localization system, realfast. The pulses were detected commensally on the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array during a survey of unidentified Fermi γ-ray sources. The bursts were localized to subarcsecond precision using realfast fast-sampled imaging. Follow-up observations with the Green Bank Telescope detected additional bursts from the same source. The bursts do not exhibit periodicity in a search up to periods of 480 s, assuming a duty cycle of <20%. The pulses are nearly 100% linearly polarized, show circular polarization up to 12%, and exhibit variable scattering on timescales of months. The arcsecond-level realfast localization links the source confidently with the Fermi γ-ray source and places it nearby (though not coincident with) an XMM-Newton X-ray source. Based on the source’s overall properties, we discuss various options for the nature of this object and propose that it could be a young pulsar, a magnetar, or a binary pulsar system.

<div> 关键词: Local Volume Complete Cluster Survey, X-ray-luminous galaxy clusters, 弱引力透镜, RS分布, 星系团动力学

总结: <br /><br />本文介绍了通过Local Volume Complete Cluster Survey项目使用弱引力透镜观测58个低红移X射线明亮星系团的研究。研究发现在星系团内部，BCG和RS分布的定向强烈相关，而RS分布和星系团质量分布的定向也有一定关联。这些定向关联暗示了星系团在宇宙时间尺度上的长期动力学演化。 <div>
The Local Volume Complete Cluster Survey is an ongoing program to observe nearly a hundred low-redshift X-ray-luminous galaxy clusters (redshifts 0.03 < z < 0.12 and X-ray luminosities in the 0.1–2.4 keV band LX500c > 1044 erg s−1) with the Dark Energy Camera, capturing data in the u, g, r, i, z bands with a 5σ point source depth of approximately 25th–26th AB magnitudes. Here, we map the aperture masses in 58 galaxy cluster fields using weak gravitational lensing. These clusters span a variety of dynamical states, from nearly relaxed to merging systems, and approximately half of them have not been subject to detailed weak lensing analysis before. In each cluster field, we analyze the alignment between the 2D mass distribution described by the aperture mass map, the 2D red-sequence (RS) galaxy distribution, and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We find that the orientations of the BCG and the RS distribution are strongly aligned throughout the interiors of the clusters: the median misalignment angle is 19° within 2 Mpc. We also observe the alignment between the orientations of the RS distribution and the overall cluster mass distribution (by a median difference of 32° within 1 Mpc), although this is constrained by galaxy shape noise and the limitations of our cluster sample size. These types of alignment suggest long-term dynamical evolution within the clusters over cosmic timescales.

<div> 关键词: 太阳活动、太阳探测器、太阳粒子、磁连接性、3He富集事件
总结: 本文报告了在2022年底和2023年初，ACE、STEREO和Solar Orbiter探测到的15次富含3He的太阳粒子事件。其中三至五次事件在至多40°的经度分隔处同时被至少两至三颗太空探测器探测到，而另外七次事件则只被单颗太空探测器探测到。通过磁连接性工具的统计分析，表明当太空探测器的模拟足点与太阳上潜在的源区的角距离小于24°时，探测概率大于50%，这支持了之前的研究结论。然而，由于日冕物质抛射、足点运动和/或磁力线的曲折路径，这可能导致在1天文单位处的探测结果出现差异。 <br /><br /> <div>
Multispacecraft observations of 3He-rich solar energetic particle (SEP) events are scarce, but much needed in order to understand and properly constrain the source and transport of these remarkably enriched 3He SEP events. In this paper, we report 15 3He-rich SEP events that were detected by the Advanced Composition Explorer, the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, and Solar Orbiter near 1 au during Solar Orbiter’s aphelion pass at the end of 2022 and early 2023. Three (five) of these events were detected simultaneously by at least two (three) spacecraft at up to ∼40° longitudinal separation, while seven events were detected by only a single spacecraft, even though an adjacent spacecraft was less than 20° apart. Using a magnetic connectivity tool, we show statistically that there is a >50% probability of detection when the spacecraft-modeled footpoints have an angular separation angle of <24° to the potential source region back at the Sun. This supports previous studies suggesting that the source of these 3He-rich SEP events is narrow in longitudinal extent. On the other hand, the magnetic connectivity due to the presence of coronal mass ejections, footpoint motion, and/or field-line meandering may also lead to difference in a detection at 1 au.

太阳望远镜的观测和Mancha3D模拟结果表明，我们对浮现下方落结的形成和演化进行了分析，同时比较了观测到的结的宽度和运动学特征与模拟调查的结果。我们使用半自动化方法恢复观测参数，发现结的平均速度为-9.68 km/s，平均宽度为614 km。模拟结果显示，在临界波长λc为100到500 km和磁场强度B0为1到20 G的范围内，λc约为300 km，B0约为2到6 G的值最接近于观测结果。由于观测和模拟结果匹配，我们得出结论：磁性雷利-泰勒不稳定可以对此观测结果提供物理上有意义的解释。此外，我们还预测，在应用点扩散函数到模拟结果的示例时，Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope将能够从观测中恢复出落体前缘上的次级不稳定性。 <br /><br />总结: 太阳望远镜和Mancha3D模拟分析表明，磁性雷利-泰勒不稳定提供了对观测结果的物理上有意义的解释。观测得出的结的速度和宽度与模拟范围内的预期值匹配。此外，我们还预测Daniel K.

Using Swedish 1 m Solar Telescope Crisp Imaging Spectro-Polarimeter 6563 Å (Hα) observations and Mancha3D simulations, we analyze the formation and evolution of falling knots beneath a hedgerow prominence. By comparing the observed knot widths and kinematics to those of a parametric survey of simulations, we estimate the range of magnetic field values and characteristic wavelengths to test if the magnetic Rayleigh–Taylor instability (MRTI) can provide a physically meaningful explanation. We recover observational parameters using a novel semiautomated method and find knot velocities with a mean of −9.68 km s−1 and a mean width of 614 km. Our simulations survey a range of critical wavelengths, λc, of 100 to 500 km, and magnetic field strengths, B0, of 1 to 20 G, finding the closest match to observations around λc = 300 km, and B0 = 2 to 6 G. As both the observational and simulated values match expected values, we conclude that the MRTI can provide a physically meaningful explanation of this observation. Additionally, we also predict that the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope will be able to observationally recover secondary instabilities on the leading edge of the falling mass through applying a point-spread function to an example from the simulated results.

<div> Fraunhofer lines, spectropolarimetric, solar eclipse, Fiber Arrayed Solar Optical Telescope, polarization amplitude
总结:
太阳赤道上的上层和内部的色球层以及近日冕层的Fraunhofer线的光谱偏振结果是由Fiber Arrayed Solar Optical Telescope在2013年11月3日在加蓬的日全食期间收集的。研究发现，这些层中的Fraunhofer线的线偏振强烈依赖于特定的谱线和位置。Mg ib1518.4 nm处的Fraunhofer线的偏振幅度可高达0.36%，而Fe i/Cr i524.7 nm等线的偏振通常混合在噪音水平的6.0 × 10−4中。总体趋势是，Fraunhofer线的偏振随着高度的增加而增加，其振幅可能接近于相邻位置产生的发射线，通常大于连续谱。Fraunhofer线的偏振方向的旋转通常伴随着偏振振幅和轮廓形状的变化。还从这些偏振特性以及其他证据中判断，在这些大气层中存在中性金属原子。 <div>
Spectropolarimetric results of Fraunhofer lines between 516.3 and 532.6 nm are presented in local upper solar chromosphere and inner corona below a height of about 0.04 solar radius above the solar limb. The data were acquired on 2013 November 3 during a total solar eclipse in Gabon by the prototype Fiber Arrayed Solar Optical Telescope. It is found that the linear polarizations of the Fraunhofer lines in these layers depend strongly on specific spectral lines and positions. A Fraunhofer line at Mg ib1518.4 nm can have a polarization amplitude up to 0.36% with respect to the continuum polarization level, while polarizations of lines like Fe i/Cr i524.7 nm are often merged in the noise level of 6.0 × 10−4. The polarizations of the Fraunhofer lines, like the emission ones and the continuum, increase with height as a whole trend, and their amplitudes can be close to those of emission ones yielded in close positions, and generally larger than those of the continuum. Rotations of the polarization directions of the Fraunhofer lines are often accompanied by variations in their polarization amplitudes and profile shapes. It is also judged from these polarimetric properties, along with other evidence, that neutral metal atoms exist in these atmospheric layers.

<div> 磁导数近似, 离子速度分布函数, 有限拉莫半径效应, 磁层边界, Kelvin-Helmholtz 不稳定性

总结: 本研究使用本地杂交-Vlasov模拟来研究磁层边界类似的横向速度剪切层中与Kelvin-Helmholtz不稳定性相关的离子速度分布函数。我们发现当速度剪切层存在密度/温度不对称性时，有限拉莫半径效应在涡旋边缘产生热流。这种热流的量级相当于总磁层能流的显著部分，提供了一种可用单一航天器测量的明显特征。在Kelvin-Helmholtz不稳定性的后期非线性阶段，还发现了混合的非麦克斯韦离子速度分布函数。我们的研究结果同样适用于在磁层边界存在微小磁场剪切的情况。 <div>
The Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (KHI), characterized by vortices forming at a perturbed velocity shear layer, is a prominent candidate mechanism for mass, momentum, and energy transport across boundaries with velocity shear in various space plasma environments. It is of particular interest at the flanks of Earth’s magnetopause, which separates the plasma of the magnetosphere from the adjacent shocked solar wind flow in the magnetosheath. In the present study, we use local hybrid-Vlasov simulations to investigate the ion velocity distribution functions (VDFs) associated with KHI in a magnetopause-like, transverse velocity shear layer setting (magnetic field perpendicular to the shear plane). We look for signatures of ion finite Larmor radius (FLR) effects, which could be utilized in spacecraft measurements to recognize when such effects are active, influencing KHI evolution and driving plasma mixing. We show that when a density/temperature asymmetry exists across the shear layer, FLR effects produce a heat flux along the vortex edges. With a magnitude (≳0.1 mW m−2) that is a significant fraction of the total magnetosheath energy flux, the heat flux provides a distinct signature that could be measured with a single spacecraft. During the late nonlinear stage of KHI, mixed non-Maxwellian ion VDFs are additionally found within the vortices. Our results are also valid in the presence of a small magnetic shear across the magnetopause.

Due to observational challenges, the mass function of black holes (BH) at lower masses is poorly constrained in the local universe. Understanding the occupation fraction of BHs in low-mass galaxies is crucial for constraining the origins of supermassive BH seeds. Compact stellar systems (CSSs), including ultracompact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) and compact elliptical galaxies (cEs), are potential intermediate-mass BH hosts. Despite the difficulties posed by their limited spheres of influence, stellar dynamical modeling has been effective in estimating central BH masses in CSSs. Some CSSs may harbor a BH constituting up to 20% of their host stellar mass, while others might not have a central BH. In support of our ongoing efforts to determine the BH masses in select CSSs in the Virgo cluster using JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations and orbit-superposition dynamical models, we create mock kinematic data mimicking the characteristics of observed cEs/UCDs in the Virgo cluster with different BH masses. We then construct a series of dynamical models using the orbit-superposition code FORSTAND and explore the accuracy of recovering the BH mass. We find that the mass of BHs comprising 1% or more of the total host stellar mass can be accurately determined through kinematic maps featuring higher-order velocity moments. We also assess how BH mass measurement is affected by deprojection methods, regularization factors, anisotropy parameters, orbit initial conditions, the absence of higher-order velocity moments, the spatial resolution, and the signal-to-noise ratio.

We present a sample of 335 Mira variables, extracted from DR9 of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) survey. These variables are characterized by the Balmer emissions (Hδ, Hγ, Hβ, and Hα) and the metal emissions (Fe iλλ 4202, 4308, 4376, and Mg iλ4571) observed in M giant spectra. We distinguished oxygen-rich stars from carbon-rich stars through the identification of carbon molecular bands present in the optical spectra. For the oxygen-rich stars we examined multiple attributes, such as the link between line strength and bolometric luminosity, and the connection between atmospheric parameters and their periods. We observed that Fe iλλ 4202, 4308 showed a significantly gradual progression, which can be postulated to trace the fluorescent emission resulting from pulsation shocks. Regarding the correlation between Teff and the period, Teff remains relatively constant over varying periods, with no clear trend, while both log g and [Fe/H] show a decreasing trend within a period range of 450 days, and this decreasing of the log g trend is consistent with the results in the literature. To shed more light on the variations of Balmer lines, we showcase time-series spectra for two objects, demonstrating that the Balmer lines reach their peak intensity during the brightest phase of the stellar cycle.

总结:<br />
这篇文章通过二维粒子模拟研究了低Mach数、低等离子体β值的准垂直激波。研究发现，在激波前缘激发了电子回旋漂移不稳定性，这是由于激波反射离子和入射电子之间的相对漂移导致的。由电子回旋漂移不稳定性触发的静电波能够散射和加热入射电子，有利于它们逃离激波的损失锥。这些电子然后被激波反射，并被SDA加速。这样一来，在低等离子体β值的准垂直激波中，SDA的加速效率得到了极大提高。 <div>
Shock drift acceleration (SDA) plays an important role in generating high-energy electrons at quasi-perpendicular shocks, but its efficiency in low-beta plasmas is questionable. In this article, we perform a two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation of a low-Mach-number, low-plasma-beta quasi-perpendicular shock, and find that the electron cyclotron drift instability is unstable at the leading edge of the shock foot, which is excited by the relative drift between the shock-reflected ions and the incident electrons. The electrostatic waves triggered by the electron cyclotron drift instability can scatter and heat the incident electrons, which facilitates their escape from the shock’s loss cone. These electrons are then reflected by the shock and energized by SDA. In this way, the acceleration efficiency of SDA at low-plasma-beta quasi-perpendicular shocks is highly enhanced.

The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) has detected very-high-energy gamma rays from the low-ionization nuclear emission-line region galaxy NGC 4278, which has a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN) and symmetric, mildly relativistic S-shaped twin jets detected by radio observations. Few LLAGNs have been detected in gamma rays due to their faintness. Earlier, several radio-emitting components were detected in the jets of NGC 4278. We model their radio emission with synchrotron emission of ultra-relativistic electrons to estimate the strength of the magnetic field inside these components within a time-dependent framework after including the ages of the different components. We show that the synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission by these components cannot explain the Swift X-ray data and the LHAASO gamma-ray data from NGC 4278. We suggest that a separate component in one of the jets is responsible for the high-energy emission, whose age, size, magnetic field, and the spectrum of the ultra-relativistic electrons inside it have been estimated after fitting the multiwavelength data of NGC 4278 with the sum of the spectral energy distributions from the radio components and the high-energy component. We note that the radio components of NGC 4278 are larger than the high-energy component, which has also been observed in several high-luminosity active galactic nuclei.

<title>Diversity in Fermi/GBM Gamma-Ray Bursts: New Insights from Machine Learning</title>

Classification of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been a long-standing puzzle in high-energy astrophysics. Recent observations challenge the traditional short versus long viewpoint, where long GRBs are thought to originate from the collapse of massive stars and short GRBs from compact binary mergers. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been instrumental in addressing this problem, revealing five distinct GRB groups within the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) light-curve data, two of which are associated with kilonovae (KNe). In this work, we extend our analysis to the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor catalog and identify five clusters using unsupervised ML techniques, consistent with the Swift/BAT results. These five clusters are well separated in the fluence-duration plane, hinting at a potential link between fluence, duration, and complexities (or structures) in the light curves of GRBs. Further, we confirm two distinct classes of KN-associated GRBs. The presence of GRB 170817A in one of the two KN-associated clusters lends evidence to the hypothesis that this class of GRBs could potentially be produced by binary neutron star mergers. The second KN-associated GRB cluster could potentially originate from neutron star–black hole mergers. Future multimessenger observations of compact binaries in gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves can be paramount in understanding these clusters better.

<title>3He and Fe Spectral Properties in 3He-rich Solar Energetic Particle Events</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have surveyed 3He-rich events on the Solar Orbiter mission from 2020 April to 2024 April, selecting isolated injections whose rollover 3He spectral shape is presumed to represent the initial acceleration state, unprocessed by subsequent activity such as coronal mass ejections or jets. A main goal has been to find relationships between the spectra of 3He and heavy ions C–Fe, in order to explore a common acceleration mechanism in spite of the fact that these events show 3He enrichments of up to ∼104, while the heavy-ion enrichment is rarely larger than ∼10. Selecting 34 3He injections, we find that heavy ions are always present, and arrive at the same time as the 3He signaling a common origin. Concentrating on Fe since it is a minor ion but with higher abundance than many others, we find its spectral shape and intensity is similar to 3He. In ∼two-thirds of the cases, if the 3He spectrum is shifted to lower energy by a factor 3.0 ± 1.3, it nearly coincides with the Fe spectrum, illustrating their close connection. Several plasma wave turbulence models have calculated spectra that also show the ion rollovers around 1 MeV nucleon−1. The unique mass-to-charge ratio of 3He allows it to interact more efficiently with the turbulence, thereby gaining several times more energy per nucleon than the other heavy ions. In the spectral rollover region this can lead to the observed enormous enhancements of 3He. The acceleration appears to be associated with magnetic reconnection in emerging flux regions on the Sun.

We report the temporal evolution of electron pitch angle distributions behind the dipolarization front (DF) in the Earth's magnetotail with observations of the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) spacecraft. Taking advantage of multipoint observations from the THEMIS mission lined up in space, we study pitch angle distributions of energetic electrons behind the DF during two typical events. Pancake, rolling-pin, and cigar distributions are observed sequentially during the acceleration process. Based on Liouville's theorem, it is revealed that pancake distribution is dominantly formed by betatron acceleration in the early stage, and rolling-pin distribution is generated by both dominant Fermi and weak betatron acceleration in the transition stage, while cigar distribution is formed by Fermi acceleration finally. Our results provide comprehensive in situ observational evidence of the temporal evolution of electron acceleration behind the DF during propagation.

<title>A Luminous X-Ray Active Galactic Nucleus in the Dwarf–Dwarf Galaxy Merger RGG 66</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad712d</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the discovery of a luminous X-ray active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the dwarf galaxy merger RGG 66. The black hole is predicted to have a mass of MBH ∼ 105.4 M⊙ and to be radiating close to its Eddington limit (Lbol/LEdd ∼ 0.75). The AGN in RGG 66 is notable both for its presence in a late-stage dwarf–dwarf merger and for its luminosity of L2–10 keV = 1042.2 erg s−1, which is among the most powerful AGNs known in nearby dwarf galaxies. The X-ray spectrum has a best-fit photon index of Γ = 2.4 and an intrinsic absorption of NH ∼ 1021 cm−2. These results come from a follow-up Chandra X-ray Observatory study of four irregular/disturbed dwarf galaxies with evidence for hosting AGNs based on optical spectroscopy. The remaining three dwarf galaxies do not have detectable X-ray sources with upper limits of L2–10 keV ≲ 1040 erg s−1. Taken at face value, our results on RGG 66 suggest that mergers may trigger the most luminous of AGNs in the dwarf galaxy regime, just as they are suspected to do in more massive galaxy mergers.

<div> 关键词: Mrk 501, IXPE, X射线偏振, 光学-红外偏振, 射电偏振

总结:<br /><br />本研究对明亮的类星体Mrk 501进行了为期14个月的多波段偏振测量。使用IXPE进行了2-8 keV的X射线偏振测量，并且伴随有来自NuSTAR、Swift/XRT和/或XMM-Newton的同时X射线数据。此外，还进行了B、V、R、I和J波段的光学-红外偏振测量，以及4.85 GHz至225.5 GHz的射电偏振测量。研究发现，尽管前五次IXPE观测中未发现X射线偏振度和角度的显著变化，但最近的第六次观测发现偏振度高于其他五次观测的平均值。光学和射电测量结果与X射线偏振特性之间没有明显的相关性。总的来说，X射线偏振度始终高于或类似于R波段光学偏振度，而后者又高于射电值。这与最初提出的能量分层激波场景一致，该场景解释了前两次IXPE观测结果，即偏振的X射线、光学和射电辐射来自不同的区域。 <div>
We present multiwavelength polarization measurements of the luminous blazar Mrk 501 over a 14 month period. The 2–8 keV X-ray polarization was measured with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) with six 100 ks observations spanning from 2022 March to 2023 April. Each IXPE observation was accompanied by simultaneous X-ray data from NuSTAR, Swift/XRT, and/or XMM-Newton. Complementary optical–infrared polarization measurements were also available in the B, V, R, I, and J bands, as were radio polarization measurements from 4.85 GHz to 225.5 GHz. Among the first five IXPE observations, we did not find significant variability in the X-ray polarization degree and angle with IXPE. However, the most recent sixth observation found an elevated polarization degree at >3σ above the average of the other five observations. The optical and radio measurements show no apparent correlations with the X-ray polarization properties. Throughout the six IXPE observations, the X-ray polarization degree remained higher than, or similar to, the R-band optical polarization degree, which remained higher than the radio value. This is consistent with the energy-stratified shock scenario proposed to explain the first two IXPE observations, in which the polarized X-ray, optical, and radio emission arises from different regions.

这项研究利用James Webb太空望远镜（JWST）的NIRCam光度学数据，从4 < z < 9的宇宙中选取了1165个极端发射线星系（EELGs）。研究使用简单的方法在光度学上鉴定出具有Hβ + [O iii]或Hα等效宽度（EW）> 5000 Å的EELGs。研究通过对部分（34个）光度学选择的EELGs进行JWST/NIRSpec光谱观测验证了选择方法，结果表明所有光谱观测的EELGs均证实了光度学识别的极端发射。研究发现CEERS中的中带F410M滤波器在识别EELGs方面特别高效。文章还提供了被错误分类为超高红移（z > 12）的EELGs的案例，并将EELGs与相同红移范围内更广泛的（次极端的）星系群体进行比较，发现它们与更广泛的发射线星系群体一致。最高EW的EELGs倾向于具有比连续谱尺寸更紧凑的发射线尺寸，这表明活动星系核至少对一些最极端的EELGs负责。光度学推断的发射线比与具有高电离和适度低金属丰度的星际介质条件一致，与先前的光谱研究一致。

总结: 
这项研究利用JWST的NIRCam光度学数据成功鉴定出1165个4 < z < 9的极端发射线星系(EELGs)，并通过光谱观测验证了其选择方法；其中CEERS中的中带F410M滤波器在识别EELGs方面特别高效；研究还发现一些EELGs可能会被错误分类为超高红移的星系，同时对EELGs和更广泛的星系进行了比较，发现它们是更广泛发射线星系群体的更蓝色、高EW的尾部。最后，研究结果还表明高EW的EELGs倾向于具有紧凑的发射线尺寸，光度学推断的发射线比也与先前的光谱研究一致。 <div>
We present a sample of 1165 extreme emission-line galaxies (EELGs) at 4 < z < 9 selected using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam photometry in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) program. We use a simple method to photometrically identify EELGs with Hβ + [O iii] (combined) or Hα emission of observed-frame equivalent width (EW) > 5000 Å. JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopic observations of a subset (34) of the photometrically selected EELGs validate our selection method: All spectroscopically observed EELGs confirm our photometric identification of extreme emission, including some cases where the spectral-energy-distribution-derived photometric redshifts are incorrect. We find that the medium-band F410M filter in CEERS is particularly efficient at identifying EELGs, both in terms of including emission lines in the filter and in correctly identifying the continuum between Hβ + [O iii] and Hα in the neighboring broadband filters. We present examples of EELGs that could be incorrectly classified as ultrahigh redshift (z > 12) as a result of extreme Hβ + [O iii] emission blended across the reddest photometric filters. We compare the EELGs to the broader (subextreme) galaxy population in the same redshift range and find that they are consistent with being the bluer, high-EW tail of a broader population of emission-line galaxies. The highest-EW EELGs tend to have more compact emission-line sizes than continuum sizes, suggesting that active galactic nuclei are responsible for at least some of the most extreme EELGs. The photometrically inferred emission-line ratios are consistent with interstellar medium conditions with high ionization and moderately low metallicity, consistent with previous spectroscopic studies.

<title>A Multiwavelength Approach to Constraining the Merger Properties of ACT-CL J0034.4+0225</title>

<div> 关键词: J0034.4+0225, 星系团, 合并, 气体分布, X射线质量估算
总结:
J0034.4+0225是一个之前未被识别的星系团，其红移为0.38588。研究发现，该星系团存在两个表面亮度峰值，分别对应于两个最亮的星系团星系，这两个峰值间距约为259千秒差距，被扩展的星系团气体包围着。通过观测数据，确定了星系团的质量，并且通过对星系团的 X 射线图像以及气体和星系团成员的速度差进行分析，确定了星系团的合并状态和特性。同时，通过强镜效分析和星系团形态分析，也对星系团的质量比和合并状态进行了进一步的限制。 <div>
ACT-CL J0034.4+0225 is a previously unrecognized merging galaxy cluster at z = 0.38588 ± 0.00068. Our primary evidence is provided by a 21 ks Chandra image that shows two surface brightness peaks separated by ∼49″ (259 kpc) surrounded by an extended cluster gas distribution. Each gas peak contains a brightest cluster galaxy, offset from the gas peak. We collect new South African Large Telescope optical spectra that, when augmented by archival data, yield redshifts for the two BGCs and 58 other cluster members. Archival Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope and MeerKAT data reveal a radio halo that encompasses the X-ray peaks. We provide and compare three X-ray-based mass estimates (5.0 × 1014M⊙, 6.4 × 1014M⊙, and 8.6 × 1014M⊙). The Planck and ACT Sunyaev–Zel’dovich masses are ≈5.8 × 1014M⊙. We constrain the merger state and properties by comparing them to an existing suite of N-body/hydrodynamical models using the measured gas peak separation (259 kpc, projected) and radial velocity difference (0–1000 km s−1). This constrains the epoch of the merger to be within ∼100 Myr of first pericenter passage. A strong lensing analysis constrains the mass ratio to be in the range 1:1–1:20, while the cluster morphology prefers values near the equal-mass range.

Understanding plasma dynamics and nonthermal particle acceleration in 3D magnetic reconnection has been a long-standing challenge. In this paper, we explore these problems by performing large-scale fully kinetic simulations of multi-X-line plasmoid reconnection with various parameters in both the weak- and strong-guide-field regimes. In each regime, we have identified its unique 3D dynamics that lead to field-line chaos and efficient acceleration, and we have achieved nonthermal acceleration of both electrons and protons into power-law spectra. The spectral indices agree well with a simple Fermi acceleration theory that includes guide-field dependence. In the low-guide-field regime, the flux rope kink instability governs the 3D dynamics for efficient acceleration. The weak dependence of the spectra on the ion-to-electron mass ratio and β (≪1) implies that the particles are sufficiently magnetized for Fermi acceleration in our simulations. While both electrons and protons are injected at reconnection exhausts, protons are primarily injected by perpendicular electric fields through Fermi reflections and electrons are injected by a combination of perpendicular and parallel electric fields. The magnetic power spectra agree with in situ magnetotail observations, and the spectral index may reflect a reconnection-driven size distribution of plasmoids instead of the Goldreich–Sridhar vortex cascade. As the guide field becomes stronger, the oblique flux ropes of large sizes capture the main 3D dynamics for efficient acceleration. Intriguingly, the oblique flux ropes can also experience flux rope kink instability, to drive extra 3D dynamics. This work has broad implications for 3D reconnection dynamics and particle acceleration in heliophysics and astrophysics.

We report nucleosynthetic results for both 44Ti and nickel isotopes for 18 three-dimensional (3D) core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations extended to ∼20 s after bounce. We find that many of our long-term models are able to achieve 44Ti/56Ni ratios similar to that observed in Cassiopeia A, and modern supernova models can synthesize up to 2 × 10−4M⊙ of 44Ti. Neutrino-driven winds and the fact that there can be simultaneous accretion and explosion in 3D models of CCSNe play central roles in its production. We conclude that the 44Ti underproduction problem in previous CCSN models is no longer an issue. In addition, we discuss the production of both 57Ni and stable nickel/iron ratios and compare our results to observations of SN 1987A and the Crab.

Blazars can be detected from very large distances due to their high luminosity. However, the detection of γ-ray emission of blazars beyond z = 3 has only been confirmed for a small number of sources. Such observations probe the growth of supermassive black holes close to the peak of star formation in the history of galaxy evolution. As a result from a continuous monitoring of a sample of 80 z > 3 blazars with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT), we present the first detection of a γ-ray flare from the z = 4.31 blazar TXS 1508+572. This source showed high γ-ray activity from 2022 February to August, reaching a peak luminosity comparable to the most luminous flares ever detected with Fermi-LAT. We conducted a multiwavelength observing campaign involving XMM-Newton, the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, the Effelsberg 100 m radio telescope, and the Very Long Baseline Array. In addition, we make use of the monitoring programs by the Zwicky Transient Facility and the Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer at optical and infrared wavelengths, respectively. We find that the source is particularly variable in the infrared band on daily timescales. The spectral energy distribution collected during our campaign is well described by a one-zone leptonic model, with the γ-ray flare originating from an increase of external Compton emission as a result of a fresh injection of accelerated electrons.

Ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays are often characterized indirectly by analyzing the properties of secondary cosmic ray particles produced in the collisions with air nuclei. The particle number Nμ of muon and the depth of shower maximum Xmax after air shower cascade are mostly studied to infer the energy and mass of the incident cosmic rays. Research has shown that there is a significant excess in the observed number of muons arriving at the ground from extensive air showers compared to the simulations using the existing cosmic ray hadronic interaction model. To explain this muon excess phenomenon, a new theoretical model, the gluon condensation model, is introduced in this paper and simulated by using the AIRES engine. We assume that the gluon condensation (GC) effect appears mainly in the first collision of the cascade, leading to a significant increase in the strangeness production, consequently, the production rate of kaons is increased, and nK/nπ is greater than the value of the usual hadronic interaction process. In the calculation, the model assumes that only pions and kaons are produced in the GC state. The increase of strange particle yield would mean that the energy transferred from the hadronic cascade to the electromagnetic cascade through π0 → 2γ decay is reduced. This would in turn increase the number of muons at the ground level due to meson decays. Our model provides a new theoretical possibility to explain the muon excess puzzle.

CME是太阳释放的等离子体，可能对太空和地面电子设备造成严重损坏。研究CME的触发、加速和演变对我们更好地理解它们非常重要，而了解太阳低日冕中CME等离子体特性使用高分辨率紫外和极紫外光谱学是十分关键的。虽然目前对低太阳日冕中CME的光谱解析观测很少，但随着Solar Orbiter上Spectal Imaging of the Coronal Environment的发射和未来即将上线的Solar-C上的EUVST和MUSE，我们将有机会获得前所未有的光谱解析CME观测。利用Hinode/EUV成像光谱仪对CME进行的唯一完整极紫外光谱观测，我们预测SPICE，EUVST和MUSE在日冕CME喷发期间预计将观测到的光谱，以研究每种仪器的诊断能力。最后，我们提供了CME等离子体诊断的密度敏感和温度敏感比值列表，以及每种仪器预期光谱图谱，以便进行观测序列规划。

总结: <br /><br />本文介绍了关于太阳等离子体爆发的研究，重点是太阳释放的CME对太空和地面电子设备可能造成的损害，以及使用紫外和极紫外光谱学来研究CME的重要性。同时，文章介绍了Solar Orbiter，EUVST和MUSE等仪器，提出了对CME进行观测的方法，并提供了密度敏感和温度敏感比值列表，以及预期光谱图谱，以便进行观测序列规划。 <div>
Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) expel multithermal, magnetized plasma from the Sun, and when directed toward Earth, can cause extensive damage to space and ground-based electronics. To better understand the triggering, acceleration, and evolution of CMEs, it is critical to study CME plasma properties close to the Sun. High-resolution ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet (UV-EUV) spectroscopy can give the most detailed plasma diagnostics of CMEs in the low solar corona. Unfortunately, very few spectrally resolved observations of CMEs in the low solar corona exist. However, with the recent launch of the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment on board Solar Orbiter and the upcoming missions, including the EUV High-Throughput Solar Telescope (EUVST) on Solar-C and the Multi-slit Solar Explorer (MUSE), we will have the opportunity to obtain unprecedented, spectrally resolved CME observations. Using the only full EUV spectral observation of a CME by the Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer, we predict the spectra that SPICE, EUVST, and MUSE are expected to observe during an off-limb CME eruption to investigate the diagnostic capabilities of each instrument. Finally, we provide a list of density-sensitive and temperature-sensitive ratios for CME plasma diagnostics along with the expected spectral atlas for each instrument to facilitate observing sequence planning.

<div> β Hyi, subgiant, rotation period, asteroseismology, magnetic activity cycle
总结:
β Hyi是一个太阳型亚巨星，研究发现它有类似太阳的振荡，通过测量旋转周期和进行磁活动循环预测，得出β Hyi的旋转周期与减弱磁制动模型相一致，这表明亚巨星的结构变化可以重新激活大尺度的动力学，从而短暂地维持磁活动循环。这一结果支持了进化的亚巨星存在“再生”动力学的观点。 <div>
The solar-type subgiant β Hyi has long been studied as an old analog of the Sun. Although the rotation period has never been measured directly, it was estimated to be near 27 days. As a Southern Hemisphere target, it was not monitored by long-term stellar activity surveys, but archival International Ultraviolet Explorer data revealed a 12 yr activity cycle. Previous ground-based asteroseismology suggested that the star is slightly more massive and substantially larger and older than the Sun, so the similarity of both the rotation rate and the activity cycle period to solar values is perplexing. We use two months of precise time-series photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite to detect solar-like oscillations in β Hyi and determine the fundamental stellar properties from asteroseismic modeling. We also obtain a direct measurement of the rotation period, which was previously estimated from an ultraviolet activity–rotation relation. We then use rotational evolution modeling to predict the rotation period expected from either standard spin-down or weakened magnetic braking (WMB). We conclude that the rotation period of β Hyi is consistent with WMB and that changes in stellar structure on the subgiant branch can reinvigorate the large-scale dynamo and briefly sustain magnetic activity cycles. Our results support the existence of a “born-again” dynamo in evolved subgiants—previously suggested to explain the cycle in 94 Aqr Aa—which can best be understood within the WMB scenario.

<br /><br />
本文通过 Parker Solar Probe (PSP) 最近的观测结果表明，在太阳圈电流层 (HCS) 处，质子和重离子被磁重连加速至高能。通过在大尺度 MHD 模拟中解决能量粒子输运方程，我们研究了在重新连接的 HCS 中质子和重离子的压缩加速。我们发现多种离子的加速导致了非热的幂律分布，其谱指数与 PSP 观测一致。我们的研究显示，质子的高能截断可以达到 1 MeV，取决于粒子扩散系数。我们还研究了不同离子种类的高能截断如何随着电荷质量比缩放。当从 Kolmogorov 磁场功率谱的准线性理论中确定扩散系数时，我们发现 α∼0.4，略小于 PSP 观测的 α∼0.7。 <div>
Recent observations by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) suggest that protons and heavier ions are accelerated to high energies by magnetic reconnection at the heliospheric current sheet (HCS). By solving the energetic particle transport equation in large-scale MHD simulations, we study the compression acceleration of protons and heavier ions in the reconnecting HCS. We find that the acceleration of multispecies ions results in nonthermal power-law distributions with a spectral index consistent with the PSP observations. Our study shows that the high-energy cutoff of protons can reach –1 MeV depending on the particle diffusion coefficients. We also study how the high-energy cutoff of different ion species scales with the charge-to-mass ratio . When determining the diffusion coefficients from the quasi-linear theory with a Kolmogorov magnetic power spectrum, we find that α ∼ 0.4, which is somewhat smaller than α ∼ 0.7 observed by PSP.

<div> 关键词: 脉冲星, 干涉测量, 辐射成分, 动态光谱, 广播望远镜<br />
总结: 
本文介绍了利用干涉测量来选择脉冲星候选对象的新技术。该技术通过识别闪烁源并测量其闪烁带宽和时间尺度来确定可能的候选对象，从而实现了对脉冲星的高效率、聚焦的时域搜索。脉冲星的闪烁与其定时属性无关，因此能够找到与时域搜索不同的脉冲星。通过升级后的巨型米波射电望远镜（uGMRT）观测PSR B1508+55、PSR J0437−4715和PSR B0031−07等脉冲星的字段，证明了这一技术在区分脉冲星和其他非闪烁点源方面的正确性，同时展示了从uGMRT相控阵波束中提取的脉冲星动态光谱等结果。同时，讨论了处理干扰和仪器效应时的挑战。<br /><br /> <div>
Pulsars have been primarily detected by their narrow pulses or periodicity in time domain data. Interferometric surveys for pulsars are challenging due to the trade-off between beam sensitivity and beam size and the corresponding tradeoff between survey sensitivity (depth), sky coverage, and computational efforts. The detection sensitivity of time domain searches for pulsars is affected by dispersion smearing, scattering, and rapid orbital motion of pulsars in binaries. We have developed a new technique to select pulsar candidates in interferometric radio images by identifying scintillating sources and measuring their scintillation bandwidth and timescale. Identifying likely candidates allows sensitive, focused time-domain searches, saving computational effort. Pulsar scintillation is independent of its timing properties and hence offers a different selection of pulsars compared to time-domain searches. Candidates identified from this method could allow us to find hard-to-detect pulsars, such as submillisecond pulsars and pulsars in very compact, highly accelerated binary orbits. We use upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) observations in the fields of PSR B1508+55, PSR J0437−4715, and PSR B0031−07 as test cases for our technique. We demonstrate that the technique correctly differentiates between the pulsar and other nonscintillating point sources and show that the extracted dynamic spectrum of the pulsar is equivalent to that extracted from the uGMRT phased array beam. We show the results from our analysis of known pulsar fields and discuss challenges in dealing with interference and instrumental effects.

<br />
大麦哲伦星系（LMC）的研究发现在氢、硫、硅和碳等多种气体中存在离子化的外流现象。这些外流的质量明显与LMC的星形成速率表面密度（ΣSFR）相关，外流的质量以及质载因子进一步揭示了这一现象的特点。研究还发现，这些外流与LMC的年轻恒星盘同步转动，并且未受到外部力量的显著影响。因此，文章推测LMC前方存在一个能够屏蔽外流免受来自银河的迎风压力影响的弓形冲击波。总结: 大麦哲伦星系中存在多种气体的离子化外流，与星形成速率相关，与年轻恒星盘同步转动，可能存在屏蔽外流的弓形冲击波。 <div>
The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is home to many H ii regions, which may lead to significant outflows. We examine the LMC’s multiphase gas (T∼104-5 K) in H i, S ii, Si iv, and C iv using 110 stellar sight lines from the Hubble Space Telescope’s Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards program. We develop a continuum fitting algorithm based on the concept of Gaussian process regression and identify reliable LMC interstellar absorption over vhelio = 175–375 km s−1. Our analyses show disk-wide ionized outflows in Si iv and C iv across the LMC with bulk velocities of ∣vout, bulk∣ ∼ 20–60 km s−1, which indicates that most of the outflowing mass is gravitationally bound. The outflows’ column densities correlate with the LMC’s star formation rate surface densities (ΣSFR), and the outflows with higher ΣSFR tend to be more ionized. Considering outflows from both sides of the LMC as traced by C iv, we conservatively estimate a total outflow rate of and a mass-loading factor of η ≳ 0.15. We compare the LMC’s outflows with those detected in starburst galaxies and simulation predictions, and find a universal scaling relation of over a wide range of star-forming conditions (ΣSFR ∼ 10−4.5–102M⊙ yr−1 kpc−2). Lastly, we find that the outflows are corotating with the LMC’s young stellar disk and the velocity field does not seem to be significantly impacted by external forces; we thus speculate on the existence of a bow shock leading the LMC, which may have shielded the outflows from ram pressure as the LMC orbits the Milky Way.

JWST载荷、星系、UFOs、空间扩展、红移

JWST观测首年的一个意外发现是，在光学上看起来被认为是紧凑的光学暗星系（OFG）群体中，存在大量空间扩展的星系（超红扁平物体，或称UFOs）。利用JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey的深度和调查区域，我们对另外112个天体进行了观测，其中56个在F444W波段分辨率很高，有效尺寸Re > 0.″25，将之前的UFO数量增加了三倍以上。这些星系的红移大约在2 < z < 4之间，具有高质量星系（），并且具有约100-1000M⊙ yr−1的星形成速率。令人惊讶的是，UFOs在整个区域都呈现出红色，空间分辨率分析显示这是由于极高的尘埃衰减（通常在大半径处甚至达到AV > 2 mag）。在形态上，我们的UFO样本大多数倾向于具有较低的Sérsic指数（n∼1），表明这些大型、大质量的OFGs在F444W中几乎没有来自球状物的贡献。此外，大多数的轴比介于0.2 < q < 0.4之间，贝叶斯建模显示它们的本征形状与倾斜的圆盘和近似椭球体的混合相一致，几乎没有来自球状的贡献。虽然动力学约束将需要确定UFOs的真实本征形状，但显而易见的是一个意外的大型、扁平或近圆形物体的群体对OFGs的数量贡献很大。<br /><br />总结: JWST观测发现了大量的空间扩展星系（UFOs），它们具有高红移、高质量和高星形成速率。这些星系在整个区域都呈现出红色，并且大多数都具有较低的Sérsic指数，表明它们几乎没有来自球状物的贡献。此外，它们的本征形状可能是倾斜的圆盘和近似椭球体的混合。 <div>
One of the more surprising findings after the first year of JWST observations is the large number of spatially extended galaxies (ultrared flattened objects, or UFOs) among the optically faint galaxy (OFG) population otherwise thought to be compact. Leveraging the depth and survey area of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey, we extend observations of the OFG population to an additional 112 objects, 56 of which are well-resolved in F444W with effective sizes, Re > 0.″25, more than tripling previous UFO counts. These galaxies have redshifts around 2 < z < 4, high stellar masses ( ), and star formation rates around ∼100–1000 M⊙ yr−1. Surprisingly, UFOs are red across their entire extents, which spatially resolved analysis of their stellar populations shows is due to large values of dust attenuation (typically AV > 2 mag even at large radii). Morphologically, the majority of our UFO sample tends to have low Sérsic indices (n ∼ 1) suggesting that these large, massive, OFGs have little contribution from a bulge in F444W. Further, a majority have axis ratios between 0.2 < q < 0.4, which Bayesian modeling suggests that their intrinsic shapes are consistent with being a mixture of inclined disks and prolate objects with little to no contribution from spheroids. While kinematic constraints will be needed to determine the true intrinsic shapes of UFOs, it is clear that an unexpected population of large, disky or prolate objects contributes significantly to the population of OFGs.

<div> 核子星；夸克物质；相变；热涨落；核化概率

总结:<br />
本文研究了在核子星内部的极高密度条件下可能形成的夸克物质。作者指出，夸克物质的形成可能是通过一种叫做核化的过程发生的，而热涨落对这一过程起着重要作用。在有限温度下，系统中的热力学量会围绕平均值产生波动。热涨落可能使核化过程在子系统中更容易发生。作者还指出，对于较低的温度，需要的过压已经超过了紧凑星所能达到的最大压力。最后，即使考虑到有限尺寸效应，对于更高的温度，核化过程也可能发生。 <div>
At the extreme densities reached in the core of neutron stars, it is possible that deconfined quark matter is produced. The formation of this new phase of strongly interacting matter is likely to occur via a first-order phase transition for the typical temperatures reached in astrophysical processes. The first seeds of quark matter would then form through a process of nucleation within the metastable hadronic phase. Here, we address the role of the thermal fluctuations in the hadronic composition on the nucleation of two-flavor quark matter. At finite temperature, the thermodynamic quantities in a system fluctuate around average values. Nucleation being a local process, it is possible that it occurs in a subsystem whose composition makes the nucleation easier. We will consider the total probability of the nucleation as the product between the probability that a subsystem has a certain hadronic composition different from the average in the bulk, and the nucleation probability in that subsystem. We will show how those fluctuations of the hadronic composition can increase the efficiency of nucleation already for temperatures ∼(0.1−1) keV. However, for temperatures ≲(1−10) MeV, the needed overpressure exceeds the maximum pressure reached in compact stars. Finally, for even larger temperatures the process of nucleation can take place, even taking into account finite-size effects.

We present detailed multiband photometric and spectroscopic observations and analysis of a rare core-collapse supernova, SN 2021wvw, that includes photometric evolution up to 250 days and spectroscopic coverage up to 100 days postexplosion. A unique event that does not fit well within the general trends observed for Type IIP supernovae, SN 2021wvw shows an intermediate luminosity with a short plateau phase of just about 75 days, followed by a very sharp (∼10 days) transition to the tail phase. Even in the velocity space, it lies at a lower velocity compared to a larger Type II sample. The observed peak absolute magnitude is −16.1 mag in r-band, and the nickel mass is well constrained to 0.020 ± 0.006 M⊙. Detailed hydrodynamical modeling using MESA+STELLA suggests a radially compact, low-metallicity, high-mass red supergiant progenitor (MZAMS = 18 M⊙), which exploded with ∼0.2 × 1051 erg s−1 leaving an ejecta mass of Mej ≈ 5 M⊙. Significant late-time fallback during the shock propagation phase is also seen in progenitor+explosion models consistent with the light-curve properties. As the faintest short-plateau supernova characterized to date, this event adds to the growing diversity of transitional events between the canonical ∼100 days plateau Type IIP and stripped-envelope events.

Precise spectroscopic classification of planet hosts is an important tool of exoplanet research at both the population and individual system level. In the era of large-scale surveys, data-driven methods offer an efficient approach to spectroscopic classification that leverages the fact that a subset of stars in any given survey has stellar properties that are known with high fidelity. Here, we use The Cannon, a data-driven framework for modeling stellar spectra, to train a generative model of spectra from the Gaia Data Release 3 Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS). Our model derives stellar labels with precisions of 72 K in Teff, 0.09 dex in logg, 0.06 dex in [Fe/H], 0.05 dex in [α/Fe], and 1.9 km s−1 in vbroad for main-sequence stars observed by Gaia DR3 by transferring GALAH labels, and is publicly available at https://github.com/isabelangelo/gaiaspec. We validate our model performance on planet hosts with available Gaia RVS spectra at SNR>50 by showing that our model is able to recover stellar parameters at ≥20% improved accuracy over the existing Gaia stellar parameter catalogs, measured by the agreement with high-fidelity labels from the Spectroscopic Observations of Cool Stars survey. We also provide metrics to test for stellar activity, binarity, and reliability of our model outputs and provide instructions for interpreting these metrics. Finally, we publish updated stellar labels and metrics that flag suspected binaries and active stars for Kepler Input Catalog objects with published Gaia RVS spectra.

We conduct a systematic search for high-redshift galaxy overdensities at 4.9 < zspec < 8.9 in both the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS)-N and GOODS-S fields using James Webb Space Telescope/Near-Infrared Camera (JWST/NIRCam) imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey and JWST Extragalactic Medium-band Survey in addition to JWST/NIRCam wide field slitless spectroscopy from the First Reionization Epoch Spectroscopic Complete Survey. High-redshift galaxy candidates are identified using Hubble Space Telescope + JWST photometry spanning λ = 0.4–5.0 μm. We confirmed the redshifts for roughly a third of these galaxies using JWST spectroscopy over λ = 3.9–5.0 μm through identification of either Hα or around the best-fit photometric redshift. The rest-ultraviolet magnitudes and continuum slopes of these galaxies were inferred from the photometry: the brightest and reddest objects appear in more dense environments and thus are surrounded by more galaxy neighbors than their fainter and bluer counterparts, suggesting accelerated galaxy evolution within overdense environments. We find 17 significant (δgal ≥ 3.04, Ngal ≥ 4) galaxy overdensities across both fields (seven in GOODS-N and 10 in GOODS-S), including the two highest redshift spectroscopically confirmed galaxy overdensities to date at and (representing densities around ∼6 and ∼12 times that of a random volume). We estimate the total halo mass of these large-scale structures to be using an empirical stellar mass-to-halo mass relation, which are likely underestimates as a result of incompleteness. These protocluster candidates are expected to evolve into massive galaxy clusters with by z = 0.

In this study, galaxy samples have been generated using mock observation techniques based on the results of TNG100-1 simulations to investigate three forms of intrinsic alignment: satellite-central alignment between the orientation of the brightest group galaxies (BGG) and the spatial distribution of their satellites, radial alignment between the satellites’ orientation and the direction toward their BGG, as well as direct alignment between the orientation of BGG and that of its satellites. Overall, the predictions of galaxy alignment generally align with observations, although minor discrepancies have been identified. For satellite-central alignment, the alignment strength and color-dependence trends are well replicated by the mock observations. Regarding radial alignment, the signals are weak but discernible, with no apparent color dependence. As for direct alignment, no signal is detected, nor is there any color dependence. We also investigate the alignment dependencies on halo or the BGG properties, and proximity effect. For satellite-central alignment, the predicted alignment signal shows a positive correlation with halo and BGG mass, consistent with observations and previous predictions. Similar correlations have also been observed with the BGG age and metallicity, which merit future observational analysis for confirmation. Proximity effects have been observed for all three types of alignment, with satellites closer to the BGG exhibiting stronger alignment signals. The influence of galaxy definition and shape determination on alignment studies is also analyzed. This study underscores the importance of employing mock observation techniques for a fair comparison between predictions and observations.

总结:<br />
本文使用PIC模拟研究了低Mach数冲击波中的静电波现象，发现在这样的冲击波中，离子尺度的斜入射哨声波会产生两个热的反向电子流，驱动不稳定的电子声波，并在演化的后期形成静电孤波。通过周期性边界的模拟，显示出电子声波的特性符合线性色散分析。对于实际速度的冲击波，静电孤波的波长将减小到电子皮深度的十分之一，并且静电孤波幅值预计将超过准静态电场的100倍以上。这些理论预测可能解释了PIC模拟和卫星测量之间高频和低频电场波动相对幅度的不一致。 <div>
Collisionless low-Mach-number shocks are abundant in astrophysical and space plasma environments, exhibiting complex wave activity and wave–particle interactions. In this paper, we present 2D Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations of quasi-perpendicular nonrelativistic (vsh ≈ (5500–22000) km s−1) low-Mach-number shocks, with a specific focus on studying electrostatic waves in the shock ramp and precursor regions. In these shocks, an ion-scale oblique whistler wave creates a configuration with two hot counterstreaming electron beams, which drive unstable electron acoustic waves (EAWs) that can turn into electrostatic solitary waves (ESWs) at the late stage of their evolution. By conducting simulations with periodic boundaries, we show that the EAW properties agree with linear dispersion analysis. The characteristics of ESWs in shock simulations, including their wavelength and amplitude, depend on the shock velocity. When extrapolated to shocks with realistic velocities (vsh ≈ 300 km s−1), the ESW wavelength is reduced to one-tenth of the electron skin depth and the ESW amplitude is anticipated to surpass that of the quasi-static electric field by more than a factor of 100. These theoretical predictions may explain a discrepancy, between PIC and satellite measurements, in the relative amplitude of high- and low-frequency electric field fluctuations.

Active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback and its impact on their host galaxies are critical to our understanding of galaxy evolution. Here, we present a combined analysis of new high resolution ultraviolet (UV) data from the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on AstroSat and archival optical spectroscopic data from the Very Large Telescope/MUSE, for the Seyfert galaxy, NGC 1365. Concentrating on the central 5 kpc region, the UVIT images in the far- and near-UV show bright star-forming knots in the circumnuclear ring as well as a faint central source. After correcting for extinction, we found the star formation rate (SFR) surface density of the circumnuclear 2 kpc ring to be similar to other starbursts, despite the presence of an AGN outflow, as seen in [O iii] 5007 Å. On the other hand, we found fainter UV and thus lower SFR in the direction southeast of the AGN relative to northwest in agreement with observations at other wavelengths from JWST and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The AGN outflow velocity is found to be lesser than the escape velocity, suggesting that the outflowing gas will rain back into the galaxy. The deep UV data have also revealed diffuse UV emission in the direction of the AGN outflow. By combining [O iii] and UV data, we found the diffuse emission to be of AGN origin.

<div> H ii regions, electron density, RRL–FS line method, observations, SOFIA Airborne Observatory

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了利用205μm [N ii]精细结构线和射电复合线来推导10个著名H ii区的电子密度。RRL-FS线方法结合了这两种光谱线，可以在无需了解电离区域大小的情况下，对n(e) ≥ 30 cm^-3的区域进行敏感探测。作者利用Green Bank天文台的H54α数据和SOFIA航空天文台的205μm数据，消除了观测中非均匀密度的显著误差。电子密度在观测的不同区域之间差异很大，从2600到36,000 cm^-3不等，其中两个低密度异常值分别为94和520 cm^-3。平均而言，这些密度比最高分辨率的单天线数据大约4倍，比182″角分辨率的单天线数据大约13倍。总体1σ的分数不确定性在0.15-0.29范围内。在RRL-FS线方法中，观测到的量与∫n2(z)dz / ∫n(z)dz成比例。这些高密度值可能是RRL-FS线技术对中心浓缩密度分布峰值的采样结果。 <div>
We employ observations of the 205 μm [N ii] fine structure (FS) line and radio recombination line (RRL) emission to derive the electron density in 10 well-known H ii regions. The combination of these two spectral lines (the RRL–FS line method) provides a sensitive probe of electron density in regions with n(e) ≥ 30 cm−3 without requiring knowledge of the size of the ionized region. By using H54α data from the Green Bank Telescope and 205 μm data from the SOFIA Airborne Observatory, we have almost identical 18″ beamwidths, removing a significant source of error for observations of H ii regions due to nonuniform density across the sources observed. The electron densities vary widely among the sources observed, from 2600 to 36,000 cm−3, with two low-density outliers at 94 and 520 cm−3. On average, these densities are a factor of 4 greater than the highest-resolution single-antenna data and a factor of almost 13 greater than the 182″ angular resolution single-antenna data having more sources in common. The total 1σ fractional uncertainties in n(e) are in the range 0.15–0.29. In the RRL–FS line method, the observationally determined quantity is proportional to ∫n2(z)dz / ∫n(z)dz. For a Gaussian density distribution much more extended than its 1/e radius, this is equal to , where n0 is the peak electron density. The high values of electron density found are plausibly the result of the RRL–FS line technique sampling the peak of a centrally condensed density distribution.

总结: <br />
本研究报告了P II主要离子的两个共振跃迁的更新振子强度数值，这对于测量星际和星系周围气体中金属丰度至关重要。我们利用观测测量和高精度的准相对论Hartree-Fock理论计算，提出了P II 961.401 Å的共振跃迁的更新振子强度值为f = 0.147 ± 0.021。这个结果利用了非常大望远镜观测到的PKS 0528–250类星体的光谱。我们还计算了其他P II共振跃迁的理论振子强度，并提供了多个P II精细结构和激发态跃迁的理论数值。更新后的P II 961 Å跃迁的振子强度将在未来的磷元素丰度研究中发挥重要作用，特别是在1152 Å线饱和的视线测量中。 <div>
Abundance measurements for the volatile element phosphorus are important for measuring the metallicity in interstellar and circumgalactic gas, where their accuracies are limited by uncertainties in the oscillator strengths. We report updated oscillator strength values for two resonant transitions of the dominant ion P II, the transitions at 961.041 and 963.801 Å, which have historically shown large uncertainties. Using a combination of observational measurements and highly accurate quasi-relativistic Hartree–Fock theoretical calculations, we present an updated oscillator strength of f = 0.147 ± 0.021 for the poorly constrained P II resonant transition at 961.401 Å, which arises from the ground electronic state 3s23p23P0 to the excited level 3s23p3d3D . This result utilizes archival optical spectra obtained with the Very Large Telescope for the quasar PKS 0528–250, which has a damped Lyα absorber at z = 2.811. We calculate a theoretical f-value = 0.153 for 961.401 Å consistent with our empirically derived value, and calculate a theoretical f-value = 1.79 for 963.801 Å. We also present theoretical oscillator strengths for the P II resonant transitions at 972.779, 1124.945, 1152.818, 1301.874, and 1532.533 Å, as well as for multiple P II fine-structure and excited-level transitions. The updated f-value for the P II 961 Å transition will be useful in future studies of P abundances, especially in sight lines where the 1152 Å line is saturated.

<title>Where Have All the Sulfur Atoms Gone? Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon as a Possible Sink for the Missing Sulfur in the Interstellar Medium. I. The C–S Band Strengths</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Despite its biogenic and astrochemical importance, sulfur (S), the 10th most abundant element in the interstellar medium (ISM) with a total abundance of S/H ≈ 2.2 × 10−5, largely remains undetected in molecular clouds. Even in the diffuse ISM where S was previously often believed to be fully in the gas phase, in recent years, observational evidence has suggested that S may also be appreciably depleted from the gas. What might be the dominant S reservoir in the ISM remains unknown. Solid sulfides like MgS, FeS, and SiS2 are excluded as major S reservoirs due to the nondetection of their expected infrared spectral bands in the ISM. In this work, we explore the potential role of sulfurated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules—PAHs with sulfur heterocycles (PASHs)—as a sink for the missing S. Utilizing density function theory, we compute the vibrational spectra of 18 representative PASH molecules. It is found that these molecules exhibit a prominent C–S stretching band at ∼10 μm and two relatively weak C–S deformation bands at 15 and 25 μm that are not mixed with the nominal PAH bands at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3, and 12.7 μm. If several parts per million of S (relative to H) are locked up in PAHs, the 10 μm C–S band would be detectable by Spitzer and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). To quantitatively explore the amount of S/H depleted in PASHs, a detailed comparison of the infrared emission spectra of PASHs with the Spitzer and JWST observations is needed.

<title>Galaxy Assembly Bias in the Stellar-to-halo Mass Relation for Red Central Galaxies from SDSS</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad6de1</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report evidence of galaxy assembly bias—the correlation between galaxy properties and biased secondary halo properties at fixed halo mass (MH)—in the stellar-to-halo mass relation for red central galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. In the MH = 1011.5–1013.5h−1M⊙ range, central galaxy stellar mass (M*) is correlated with the number density of galaxies within 10 h−1 Mpc (δ10), a common proxy for halo formation time. This galaxy assembly bias signal is also present when MH, M*, and δ10 are substituted with group luminosity, galaxy luminosity, and metrics of the large-scale density field. To associate differences in δ10 with variations in halo formation time, we fitted a model that accounts for (1) errors in the MH measured by the J. L. Tinker group catalog and (2) the level of correlation between halo formation time and M* at fixed MH. Fitting of this model yields that (1) errors in MH are ∼0.15 dex and (2) halo formation time and M* are strongly correlated (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient ∼0.85). At fixed MH, variations of ∼0.4 dex in M* are associated with ∼1–3 Gyr variations in halo formation time and galaxy formation time (from stellar population fitting). These results are indicative that halo properties other than MH can impact central galaxy assembly.

The evolution of halos with masses around Mh ≈ 1011M⊙ and Mh ≈ 1012M⊙ at redshifts z > 9 is examined using constrained N-body simulations. The average specific mass accretion rates, , exhibit minimal mass dependence and generally agree with existing literature. Individual halo accretion histories, however, vary substantially. About one-third of simulations reveal an increase in around z ≈ 13. Comparing simulated halos with observed galaxies having spectroscopic redshifts, we find that for galaxies at z ≳ 9, the ratio between observed star formation rate and is approximately 2%. This ratio remains consistent for the stellar-to-halo mass ratio (SHMR) but only for z ≳ 10. At z ≃ 9, the SHMR is notably lower by a factor of a few. At z ≳ 10, there is an agreement between specific star formation rates (sSFRs) and . However, at z ≃ 9, observed sSFRs exceed simulated values by a factor of 2. It is argued that the mildly elevated SHMR in high-z halos with Mh ≈ 1011M⊙ can be achieved by assuming the applicability of the local Kennicutt–Schmidt law and a reduced effectiveness of stellar feedback due to deeper gravitational potential of high-z halos of a fixed mass.

We derive the central stellar velocity dispersion function (VDF) for quiescent galaxies in 280 massive clusters with in IllustrisTNG300. The VDF is an independent tracer of the dark matter mass distribution of subhalos in galaxy clusters. Based on the IllustrisTNG cluster catalog, we select quiescent member subhalos with a specific star formation rate <2 × 10−11 yr−1 and stellar mass . We then simulate fiber spectroscopy to measure the stellar velocity dispersion of the simulated galaxies; we compute the line-of-sight velocity dispersions of star particles within a cylindrical volume that penetrates the core of each subhalo. We construct the VDFs for quiescent subhalos within R200. The simulated cluster VDF exceeds the simulated field VDF for , indicating the preferential formation of large velocity dispersion galaxies in dense environments. The excess is similar in simulations and in the observations. We also compare the simulated VDF for the three most massive clusters with with the observed VDF for the two most massive clusters in the local Universe, Coma and A2029. Intriguingly, the simulated VDFs are significantly lower for . This discrepancy results from (1) a smaller number of subhalos with in TNG300 compared to the observed clusters, and (2) a significant offset between the observed and simulated M*–σ* relations. The consistency in the overall shape of the observed and simulated VDFs offers a unique window into galaxy and structure formation in simulations.

三重星系统TIC 290061484打破了最短外部周期的记录，内部二进制系统表现出明显的食变时间变化。光动力学模型显示，三颗星将在20百万年内合并并经历II型超新星爆炸，留下一个单一的中子星残骸。 <div>
We have discovered a triply eclipsing triple-star system, TIC 290061484, with the shortest known outer period, Pout, of only 24.5 days. This “eclipses” the previous record set by λ Tauri at 33.02 days, which held for 68 yr. The inner binary, with an orbital period of Pin = 1.8 days, produces primary and secondary eclipses and exhibits prominent eclipse timing variations with the same periodicity as the outer orbit. The tertiary star eclipses, and is eclipsed by, the inner binary with pronounced asymmetric profiles. The inclinations of both orbits evolve on observable timescales such that the third-body eclipses exhibit dramatic depth variations in TESS data. A photodynamical model provides a complete solution for all orbital and physical parameters of the triple system, showing that the three stars have masses of 6.85, 6.11, and 7.90 M⊙, radii near those corresponding to the main sequence, and Teff in the range of 21,000–23,700 K. Remarkably, the model shows that the triple is in fact a subsystem of a hierarchical 2+1+1 quadruple with a distant fourth star. The outermost star has a period of ∼3200 days and a mass comparable to the stars in the inner triple. In ∼20 Myr, all three components of the triple subsystem will merge, undergo a Type II supernova explosion, and leave a single remnant neutron star. At the time of writing, TIC 290061484 is the most compact triple system and one of the tighter known compact triples (i.e., Pout/Pin = 13.7).

研究使用深度的斯皮策中红外光谱图对M101、NGC 628和NGC 2403三个附近的星系进行了研究，以探索多环芳烃（PAHs）在次太阳金属丰度下存在缺失的物理原因。研究发现，当金属丰度从太阳值降低到0.2太阳金属丰度以下时，PAHs总量与尘埃的辐射比率保持相对稳定，但在2/3太阳金属丰度以下迅速下降。为了解释这一现象，文章使用了新开发的颗粒模型来复现观测到的PAH-金属丰度关系，其中包括PAH特征强度的变化。最佳的模型使用了一个随金属丰度下降而变化的颗粒大小分布，表明金属丰度低时抑制了颗粒的生长，暗示星系中连续的补充过程是塑造PAH颗粒群的主导过程。 
<br /><br />总结: 
在跨越三个星系的实验中发现，PAH-金属丰度关系并非由辐射环境中最小颗粒的偏好破坏所导致，而是由金属丰度降低抑制颗粒生长而导致的。这一现象揭示了星系中连续的颗粒补充过程在塑造PAH颗粒群中发挥主导作用。 <div>
We use deep Spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopic maps of radial strips across three nearby galaxies with well-studied metallicity gradients (M101, NGC 628, and NGC 2403) to explore the physical origins of the observed deficit of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at subsolar metallicity (i.e., the PAH–metallicity relation or PZR). These maps allow us to trace the evolution of all PAH features from 5–18 μm as metallicity decreases continuously from solar (Z⊙) to 0.2 Z⊙. The total PAH-to-dust luminosity ratio remains relatively constant until reaching a threshold of ∼ 2/3 Z⊙, below which it declines smoothly but rapidly. The PZR has been attributed to preferential destruction of the smallest grains in the hard radiation environments found at low metallicity. In this scenario, a decrease in emission from the shortest-wavelength PAH features is expected. In contrast, we find a steep decline in long-wavelength power below Z⊙, especially in the 17 μm feature, with the shorter-wavelength PAH bands carrying an increasingly large fraction of power at low metallicity. We use newly developed grain models to reproduce the observed PZR trends, including these variations in fractional PAH feature strengths. The model that best reproduces the data employs an evolving grain size distribution that shifts to smaller sizes as metallicity declines. We interpret this as a result of inhibited grain growth at low metallicity, suggesting continuous replenishment in the interstellar medium is the dominant process shaping the PAH grain population in galaxies.

Transient current sheets (CSs) are common magnetic structures in the solar wind that can significantly disturb the planetary space environment and cause space weather phenomena. This study focuses on their properties in the Martian space environment and investigates their transformations caused by the Martian bow shock. Based on 14 months of data from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission during similar solar activity, 786 CSs with directional changes greater than 90° and magnetic field depression were automatically identified, including 256 events in the upstream solar wind and 530 events in the Martian magnetosheath. After crossing the bow shock, the duration and thickness of the CSs decrease, while their current density and occurrence rate significantly increase. In the Martian magnetosheath, CSs located on the dayside exhibit stronger current density, a relatively lower occurrence rate, and a smaller than CSs located on the nightside. From the dayside to the nightside, the predominant magnetic field component of CSs changes to due to the draping process. Moreover, a clear dawn–dusk asymmetry in CS properties emerges from the foreshock to the downstream region of the Martian bow shock. Our results reveal the properties and evolution of solar wind CSs in the Martian space environment.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章报告了对TDE ASASSN-19bt/AT 2019ahk的详细射电观测结果，跨越了40至1464天的光学闪耀发现后的时间范围。研究发现，ASASSN-19bt的射电发射显示出与其他TDE不同的异常演化，其射电发射峰值亮度在光学发现后的457天内迅速增加，然后趋于稳定。通过广义的均衡技术，估算了两种可能的发射几何结构的能量和相应的物理参数，包括非相对论球形流和从不同观测角度观察到的相对论流。研究发现，非相对论解意味着出流的能量从E ∼ 10^46增加到E ∼ 10^49 erg，流速β约为0.05，而非轴向相对论喷流解则建议在极端非轴向情况下晚期为E ≈ 10^52 erg，洛伦兹因子Γ∼10。没有模型能全面解释射电发射的起源和演化，这强调了需要更复杂的模型。ASASSN-19bt成为显示出异常射电发射的TDE种群的一部分。进行这些TDE的长期射电观测，特别是在后期阶段，对于理解TDE中这类射电发射的产生至关重要。 <div>
We present detailed radio observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-19bt/AT 2019ahk, obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, and the MeerKAT radio telescopes, spanning 40–1464 days after the onset of the optical flare. We find that ASASSN-19bt displays unusual radio evolution compared to other TDEs, as the peak brightness of its radio emission increases rapidly until 457 days post-optical discovery and then plateaus. Using a generalized approach to standard equipartition techniques, we estimate the energy and corresponding physical parameters for two possible emission geometries: a nonrelativistic spherical outflow and a relativistic outflow observed from a range of viewing angles. We find that the nonrelativistic solution implies a continuous energy rise in the outflow from E ∼ 1046 to E ∼ 1049 erg with outflow speed β ≈ 0.05, while the off-axis relativistic jet solution instead suggests E ≈ 1052 erg with Lorentz factor Γ ∼ 10 at late times in the maximally off-axis case. We find that neither model provides a holistic explanation for the origin and evolution of the radio emission, emphasizing the need for more complex models. ASASSN-19bt joins the population of TDEs that display unusual radio emission at late times. Conducting long-term radio observations of these TDEs, especially during the later phases, will be crucial for understanding how these types of radio emission in TDEs are produced.

总结:<br />
这篇文章研究了NGC 4826星系的红外光度和哈勃空间望远镜成像和光谱，采用Schwarzschild动力学建模测量了其中心黑洞质量M。通过光度分解，发现NGC 4826包含约相等质量的经典和伪球。其总V波段光度为MVT = −21.07，经典球体与总光比为B/T ≃ 0.12，伪球与总光比为PB/T ≃ 0.13，外部盘呈指数型。最佳拟合的Schwarzschild模型得出的黑洞质量满足M与K带光度、恒星质量和经典球体速度色散的相关性。然而，与总（经典加伪）球体光度相关性相比，黑洞质量偏低。因此，NGC 4826星系符合以往关于黑洞比例关系的研究结果，并有助于加强低黑洞质量下的结果。 <div>
We present infrared photometry and Hubble Space Telescope imaging and spectroscopy of the Sab galaxy NGC 4826. Schwarzschild dynamical modeling is used to measure its central black hole mass M. Photometric decomposition is used to enable a comparison of M to published scaling relations between black hole masses and properties of host bulges. This decomposition implies that NGC 4826 contains classical and pseudobulges of approximately equal mass. The classical bulge has best-fit Sérsic index n = 3.27. The pseudobulge is made up of three parts, an inner lens (n = 0.18 at r ≲ 4″), an outer lens (n = 0.17 at r ≲ 45″), and a n = 0.58 Sérsic component required to match the surface brightness between the lens components. The total V-band luminosity of the galaxy is MVT = −21.07, the ratio of classical bulge to total light is B/T ≃ 0.12, and the ratio of pseudobulge to total light is PB/T ≃ 0.13. The outer disk is exponential (n = 1.07) and makes up D/T = 0.75 of the light of the galaxy. Our best-fit Schwarzschild model has a black hole mass with 1σ uncertainties of and a stellar population with a K-band mass-to-light ratio of at the assumed distance of 7.27 Mpc. Our modeling is marginally consistent with M = 0 at the 3σ limit. These best-fit parameters were calculated assuming the black hole is located where the velocity dispersion is largest; this is offset from the maximum surface brightness, probably because of dust absorption. The black hole mass—one of the smallest measured by modeling stellar dynamics—satisfies the well known correlations of M with the K-band luminosity, stellar mass, and velocity dispersion of the classical bulge only. In contrast, the black hole is undermassive with respect to the correlation of M with total (classical plus pseudo) bulge luminosity. Thus the composite (classical bulge plus pseudobulge) galaxy NGC 4826 is consistent with previous results on black hole scaling relations and helps to strengthen these results at low black hole masses.

<div> Population III stars, Type Ia supernovae, redshift, JWST, IMF
<br /><br />总结:
该研究调查了在宇宙学框架下产生Type Ia超新星的Population III双星的情况。研究发现，假设初始恒星质量函数偏好低质量恒星，Population III恒星可能在高红移处引发大量SNe Ia，甚至可能成为z≳6时主要的SNe Ia产生者。在乐观的情况下，JWST在3年内的调查中预期在z≈4（5）处能够发现约1（2）颗来自Population III恒星的SNe Ia。在相同的调查中，可能会记录到大约400颗低红移（z≲2.5）处的SNe Ia，但只有大约一颗来自Population III的祖先。在红移为5-10的同一视场中可能会有大约6颗Population III SNe Ia。对5-10红移范围内的SNe Ia率的观测限制可以对Population III星的IMF提出关键限制。 <div>
Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered at redshift z ≲ 2.5 are presumed to be produced from Population I/II stars. In this work, we investigate the production of SNe Ia from Population III binaries in the cosmological framework. We derive the SN Ia rate as a function of redshift in a theoretical context for the production of first-generation stars and evaluate the likelihood of their detection by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Assuming the initial stellar mass function (IMF) favors low-mass stars, as from recent numerical simulations, we found that Population III stars may give rise to a considerable number of SNe Ia at high redshift, and Population III stars may even be the dominant SN Ia producer at z ≳ 6. In an optimistic scenario, we expect ∼1(2) SNe Ia from Population III stars at z ≈ 4(5) for a survey of area during a 3 yr period with JWST. The same survey may record more than ∼400 SNe Ia at lower redshift (z ≲ 2.5) but with only about one of them from Population III progenitors. There will be ∼six Population III SNe Ia in the same field of view at redshifts of 5–10. Observational constraints on SN Ia rates at the redshift range of 5–10 can place crucial constraints on the IMF of Population III stars.

<br />
该研究利用NuSTAR望远镜观测到了附近强大的射电星系Pictor A，清晰地检测到了位于主星系西侧约4分钟的热点的X射线辐射，这是迄今为止最显著的在10keV以上探测到的热点辐射。通过光谱分析发现，其最佳拟合为指数为2.03的幂律分布，指数越小代表越硬的光谱。此外，通过Chandra观测发现了短时间尺度内的软X射线流量变化，强烈证实了热点的X射线辐射具有同步辐射特性。而光谱截断能量的下限则表明热点中的电子能量至少达到几TeV数量级。这些发现对于揭示射电星系喷流中X射线辐射的物理机制和条件具有重要意义。
<br /><br />总结: 
X射线辐射的探测；NuSTAR观测到Pictor A热点的X射线辐射；热点光谱分析结果；Chandra观测发现热点X射线流量变化；研究对射电星系喷流X射线辐射物理机制和条件具有重要意义。 <div>
The origin of X-ray emission from the resolved kiloparsec-scale jets and hotspots of many active galactic nuclei remains uncertain, particularly where the X-ray emission is separate from the radio-optical synchrotron component. Possible explanations include synchrotron emission from a second electron population and external Compton or synchrotron self-Compton processes—alternatives which imply very different physical conditions within the jet. Until recently, X-ray studies of resolved jets and hotspots have been restricted to below ∼10 keV, often showing a hard spectral index indicating a spectral peak beyond this energy range. Here we present NuSTAR observations of the nearby powerful radio galaxy Pictor A, in which we clearly detect the western hotspot at approximately 4′ from the host galaxy, the most significant detection of hotspot emission above 10 keV to date. The NuSTAR spectrum is best fit by a single power law of index Γ = 2.03 ± 0.04; an exponential cutoff gives a 1σ lower limit on the cutoff energy of 40.7 keV. We confirm previous findings of variations in the soft X-ray flux detected by Chandra over the 2000 to 2015 period, at a significance of 6.5σ. This rises to >8σ in the common 3–8 keV band using the combined 22 yr span of Chandra and NuSTAR observations. The variability of the western Pictor A hotspot strongly confirms the previously argued synchrotron nature of the X-ray emission for the hotspot, while the lower bound to the spectral cutoff energy implies electron energies in the hotspot reach up to at least a few TeV.

<div> 关键词: JWST, 红移, 星系, 重力透镜, 星系团
总结:
JWST的空白场观测程序尚未发现预期在15≤ z ≤ 20形成的第一个星系，因此需要寻找更有效的调查策略。本文探讨了利用引力透镜星系团场的有效性，这在哈勃空间望远镜中已经被证明是最有效的发现工具。研究分析了JWST NIRCam模块中提供最高平均放大倍数的最庞大星系团在揭示这一群体方面的效果。结果表明，具有高放大倍数的前景庞大星系团特定领域，可以在单个NIRCam模块中揭示15≤ z ≤ 20范围的最高可能性，并且发现JWST可能的最高红移星系。而利用多个庞大星系团来交换调查深度则是一种更为高效的探索z > 15范围的时间有效方法。 <div>
Several large JWST blank field observing programs have not yet discovered the first galaxies expected to form at 15 ≤ z ≤ 20. This has motivated the search for more effective survey strategies that will be able to effectively probe this redshift range. Here, we explore the use of gravitationally lensed cluster fields, which have historically been the most effective discovery tool with the Hubble Space Telescope. In this paper, we analyze the effectiveness of the most massive galaxy clusters that provide the highest median magnification factor within a single JWST NIRCam module in uncovering this population. The results of exploiting these lensing clusters to break the z > 15 barrier are compared against the results from large-area, blank-field surveys such as JADES and CEERS in order to determine the most effective survey strategy for JWST. We report that the fields containing massive foreground galaxy clusters specifically chosen to occupy the largest fraction of a single NIRCam module with high magnification factors in the source plane while containing all multiple images in the image plane within a single module provide the highest probability of both probing the 15 ≤ z ≤ 20 regime as well as discovering the highest-redshift galaxy possible with JWST. We also find that using multiple massive clusters in exchange for shallower survey depths is a more time-efficient method of probing the z > 15 regime.

<br />总结:
ALMA观测了BHR 71 IRS1和IRS2的Class 0原恒星系统，检测到了12CO、13CO、C18O、H2CO和SiO分子线以及1.3mm连续谱。紧凑的尘埃连续发射显示了中心组分和延伸的发射，同时没有发现螺旋、环或间隙等结构。通过C18O线的位置-速度图分析，未发现明显的开普勒运动。然而，可以对BHR 71 IRS1和BHR 71 IRS2的中心原恒星质量设定上限。同时，通过12CO和SiO追踪的喷流显示出两个组分，即宽角流和喷流，在IRS1中，喷流表现出双螺旋结构，反映了系统的角动量移除，而在IRS2中，喷流非常集中并显示出一串节，这表明发生了周期性的吸积事件。 <div>
We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the binary Class 0 protostellar system BHR 71 IRS1 and IRS2 as part of the Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) ALMA Large Program. We describe the 12CO (J = 2–1), 13CO (J = 2–1), C18O (J = 2–1), H2CO (J = 32,1–22,0), and SiO (J = 5–4) molecular lines along with the 1.3 mm continuum at high spatial resolution (∼0.″08 or ∼5 au). Dust continuum emission is detected toward BHR 71 IRS1 and IRS2, with a central compact component and extended continuum emission. The compact components are smooth and show no sign of substructures such as spirals, rings, or gaps. However, there is a brightness asymmetry along the minor axis of the presumed disk in IRS1, possibly indicative of an inclined geometrically and optically thick disk-like component. Using a position–velocity diagram analysis of the C18O line, clear Keplerian motions were not detected toward either source. If Keplerian rotationally supported disks are present, they are likely deeply embedded in their envelope. However, we can set upper limits of the central protostellar mass of 0.46 M⊙ and 0.26 M⊙ for BHR 71 IRS1 and BHR 71 IRS2, respectively. Outflows traced by 12CO and SiO are detected in both sources. The outflows can be divided into two components, a wide-angle outflow and a jet. In IRS1, the jet exhibits a double helical structure, reflecting the removal of angular momentum from the system. In IRS2, the jet is very collimated and shows a chain of knots, suggesting episodic accretion events.

本研究探讨了宇宙射线在小尺度上与星际介质的耦合问题。研究通过数值模拟构建了一个两区域宇宙射线传输模型，并发现在冷气体中快速扩散导致更多的冷气体形成，而在温暖气体中缓慢扩散导致宇宙射线能量从湍流能级吸收，这同时也导致了湍流能级在辐射冷却过程中的损失。最后，研究表明，该两区域模型能够匹配模拟中的一些传输路径的格默测量结果。 
<br /><br />总结: <div>
While cosmic rays (E ≳ 1 GeV) are well coupled to a galaxy’s interstellar medium (ISM) at scales of L > 100 pc, adjusting stratification and driving outflows, their impact on small scales is less clear. Based on calculations of the cosmic-ray diffusion coefficient from observations of the grammage in the Milky Way, cosmic rays have little time to dynamically impact the ISM on those small scales. Using numerical simulations, we explore how more complex cosmic-ray transport could allow cosmic rays to couple to the ISM on small scales. We create a two-zone model of cosmic-ray transport, with the cosmic-ray diffusion coefficient set at the estimated Milky Way value in cold gas but smaller in warm gas. We compare this model to simulations with a constant diffusion coefficient. Quicker diffusion through cold gas allows more cold gas to form compared to a simulation with a constant, small diffusion coefficient. However, slower diffusion in warm gas allows cosmic rays to take energy from the turbulent cascade anisotropically. This cosmic-ray energization comes at the expense of turbulent energy which would otherwise be lost during radiative cooling. Finally, we show our two-zone model is capable of matching observational estimates of the grammage for some transport paths through the simulation.

We present a numerical analysis investigating the reliability of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) delay-time distributions recovered from individual host galaxy star formation histories. We utilize star formation histories of mock samples of galaxies generated from the IllustrisTNG simulation at two redshifts to recover delay-time distributions. The delay-time distributions are constructed through piecewise constants as opposed to typically employed parametric forms such as power laws or Gaussian or skew/lognormal functions. The SN Ia delay-time distributions are recovered through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo exploration of the likelihood space by comparing the expected SN Ia rate within each mock galaxy to the observed rate. We show that a reduced representative sample of nonhost galaxies is sufficient to reliably recover delay-time distributions while simultaneously reducing the computational load. We also highlight a potential systematic between recovered delay-time distributions and the mass-weighted ages of the underlying host galaxy stellar population.

本文利用eROSITA全天巡天观测数据，在局部（D < 200 Mpc）矮星系中收集了74对活动星系核-矮星系对。通过清除X射线背景源、X射线双星和超亮X射线源，分析了矮星系中存在超大质量黑洞的情况。得出了矮星系AGN的光度函数，研究了黑洞质量与恒星质量的关系，并与本地和高红移关系进行了对比。研究结果表明，局部AGN在不同质量尺度上经历了类似的生长历史。同时，还与半解析模型进行了比较，结果表明数据支持将超大质量黑洞在矮星系中保持适度活跃的模型，这也促使模型改进以与矮星系中的AGN进行比较。 <div>
Although supermassive black holes (SMBHs) reside in the heart of virtually every massive galaxy, it remains debated whether dwarf galaxies commonly host SMBHs. Because low-mass galaxies may retain memory of the assembly history of their black holes (BHs), probing the BH occupation fraction of local dwarf galaxies might offer insights into the growth and seeding mechanisms of the first BHs. In this work, we exploit the Western half of the eROSITA all-sky survey (covering 20,000 deg2) and compile a catalog of accreting SMBHs in local (D < 200 Mpc) dwarf galaxies. Cleaning our sample from X-ray background sources, X-ray binaries, and ultraluminous X-ray sources, we identify 74 active galactic nucleus (AGN)–dwarf galaxy pairs. Using this large and uniform sample, we derive the luminosity function of the dwarf galaxy AGN, fitting it with a power-law function and obtaining . Measuring the offset between the dwarf galaxies' centroids and the X-ray sources, we find that ≈50% of the AGN are likely off-nuclear, in agreement with theoretical predictions. We compare the BH-to-stellar mass relation of our sample with the local and high-redshift relations, finding that our sources better adhere to the former, which suggests that local AGN across different mass scales undergo similar growth histories. Finally, we compare our sources with semianalytical models: while our sample’s shallowness prevents distinguishing between different seeding models, we find that the data favor models that keep SMBHs in dwarf galaxies active at a moderate rate, motivating model improvement by comparison to AGN in the dwarf galaxy regime.

在这篇文章中，研究人员对Montreal白矮星数据库100 pc样本和Pan-STARRS足迹中M > 0.9 M⊙、Teff ≥ 11,000 K的大质量白矮星进行了详细的模型大气分析。作者进行了109个目标的光学光谱后续研究，对样本中的204个对象进行了完整的光谱后续研究。研究发现118个正常的DA型白矮星，包括45个质量接近ZZ Ceti不稳定带的大质量DA型。样本中没有正常的大质量DB型，而其中六个DB型的白矮星是强磁性和/或快速自转的。样本中有20个大质量DQ型白矮星，所有的DQ型都处在晶化序列中。此外，样本中有66个目标是磁性的（占样本的32%）。研究人员使用磁性白矮星大气模型来限制磁场强度和几何形状，并使用磁性，运动学和自转测量来限制这一人口中合并残留物候选的分数。本样本中合并分数从0.9-1 M⊙的白矮星的25%增加到1.2-1.3 M⊙的49%。然而，对于1.1-1.2 M⊙的白矮星合并分数高达%。先前的研究表明，高质量白矮星中有5-9%因22Ne精馏过程停止冷却约8亿年，这导致太阳邻域Q-支白矮星的过剩。作者证明了我们样本中合并残留物的过多可能是由于相同的过程导致的。 <div>
We present a detailed model atmosphere analysis of massive white dwarfs with M > 0.9 M⊙ and Teff ≥ 11,000 K in the Montreal White Dwarf Database 100 pc sample and the Pan-STARRS footprint. We obtained follow-up optical spectroscopy of 109 objects with no previous spectral classification in the literature. Our spectroscopic follow-up is now complete for all 204 objects in the sample. We find 118 normal DA white dwarfs, including 45 massive DAs near the ZZ Ceti instability strip. There are no normal massive DBs: the six DBs in the sample are strongly magnetic and/or rapidly rotating. There are 20 massive DQ white dwarfs in our sample, and all are found in the crystallization sequence. In addition, 66 targets are magnetic (32% of the sample). We use magnetic white dwarf atmosphere models to constrain the field strength and geometry using offset dipole models. We also use magnetism, kinematics, and rotation measurements to constrain the fraction of merger remnant candidates among this population. The merger fraction of this sample increases from 25% for 0.9–1 M⊙ white dwarfs to 49% for 1.2–1.3 M⊙. However, this fraction is as high as % for 1.1–1.2 M⊙ white dwarfs. Previous works have demonstrated that 5%–9% of high-mass white dwarfs stop cooling for ∼8 Gyr due to the 22Ne distillation process, which leads to an overdensity of Q-branch stars in the solar neighborhood. We demonstrate that the overabundance of the merger remnant candidates in our sample is likely due to the same process.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章通过3D3V混合Vlasov模拟研究了磁暴尾等离子体中的湍流现象，发现了最近由NASA的磁层多尺度任务观测到的新型电子唯一再连接以及它对离子加热的影响。文章表明，在接近电子尺度的注入处，离子加热对电子唯一再连接具有显着影响，βi值较大时，离子与电子之间的解耦现象加剧。此外，文章还发现了离子在碰撞不到等离子体中的湍流加热对注入尺度与ρi之间的分离、βi和有限k∥效应敏感，因此需要进一步研究以得到准确的模型。这些发现对其他碰撞不到的天体物理环境，如星团间介质中的高β等离子体，具有重要意义，因为在这些环境中，微不稳定性或激波等过程可能会在离子动力学尺度附近注入能量。 <div>
We perform 3D3V hybrid-Vlasov simulations of turbulence with quasi-isotropic, compressible injection near ion scales to mimic the Earth’s magnetosheath plasma, and investigate the novel electron-only reconnection, recently observed by NASA’s Magnetospheric Multiscale mission, and its impact on ion heating. Retaining electron inertia in the generalized Ohm's law enables collisionless magnetic reconnection. Spectral analysis shows a shift from kinetic Alfvén waves to inertial kinetic Alfvén and inertial whistler waves near electron scales. To distinguish the roles of inertial scale and gyroradius (di and ρi), three ion beta (βi = 0.25, 1, 4) values are studied. Ion-electron decoupling increases with βi, as ions become less mobile when the injection scale is closer to ρi than di, highlighting the role of ρi in achieving an electron magnetohydrodynamic regime at sub-ion scales. This regime promotes electron-only reconnection in turbulence with small-scale injection at βi ≳ 1. We observe significant ion heating even at large βi, with Qi/ϵ ≈ 69%, 91%, and 96% at βi = 0.25, 1, and 4, respectively. While ion heating is anisotropic at βi ≤ 1 (Ti,⊥ > Ti,∥), it is marginally anisotropic at βi > 1 (Ti,⊥ ≳ Ti,∥). Our results show ion turbulent heating in collisionless plasmas is sensitive to the separation between injection scales (λinj) and ρi, βi, and finite-k∥ effects, necessitating further investigation for accurate modeling. These findings have implications for other collisionless astrophysical environments, like high-β plasmas in intracluster medium, where processes such as microinstabilities or shocks may inject energy near ion-kinetic scales.

<div> 关键词: pulsars, dispersion, scattering, H ii regions, electron density<br />
总结: 通过最近的无线电调查发现，一些脉冲星的离散度和散射延迟超过了观测到的脉冲星群体，部分脉冲星的电子柱密度甚至超过了银河电子密度模型的最大预测。研究发现，大多数离散度大于600 pc cm−3并且散射延迟大于10毫秒的脉冲星位于H ii区域后方，而H ii区域的交叉可能与观测到的脉冲星群体的三分之一相关。考虑到H ii区域可以解释银河电子密度模型将高离子密度脉冲星置于银河盘外的矛盾。研究还发现，通过比较复合线观测推断的发射度与脉冲星的电子密度，H ii区域可能在脉冲星的视线方向上贡献了几十到几百pc/cm³的电子柱密度。几乎所有具有显著离群（和缺失）散射的脉冲星都与已知的离子化气体结构（包括H ii区域）空间相符。考虑到H ii区域对于解释无线电离散度和散射测量作为电子密度示踪器的重要性，不仅在银河系中，还在其他星系中至关重要。 <br /><br /> <div>
Recent radio surveys have revealed pulsars with dispersion and scattering delays induced by ionized gas that are larger than the rest of the observed pulsar population, in some cases with electron column densities (or dispersion measures, DMs) larger than the maximum predictions of Galactic electron density models. By cross-matching the observed pulsar population against H ii region catalogs, we show that the majority of pulsars with DM > 600 pc cm−3 and scattering delays τ(1 GHz) > 10 ms lie behind H ii regions, and that H ii region intersections may be relevant to as much as a third of the observed pulsar population. The fraction of the full pulsar population with sightlines intersecting H ii regions is likely larger. Accounting for H ii regions resolves apparent discrepancies where Galactic electron density models place high-DM pulsars beyond the Galactic disk. By comparing emission measures inferred from recombination line observations to pulsar DMs, we show that H ii regions can contribute tens to hundreds of parsecs per cubic centimeter in electron column density along a pulsar line of sight. We find that nearly all pulsars with significant excess (and deficit) scattering from the mean τ–DM relation are spatially coincident with known discrete ionized gas structures, including H ii regions. Accounting for H ii regions is critical to the interpretation of radio dispersion and scattering measurements as electron density tracers, both in the Milky Way and in other galaxies.

Constraining the formation processes of small solar system bodies is crucial for gaining insights into planetesimal formation. Their bulk densities, determined by their compressive strengths, offer valuable information about their formation history. In this paper, we utilize a formulation of the compressive strength of dust aggregates obtained from dust N-body simulations to establish the relation between the bulk density and diameter. We find that this relation can be effectively approximated by a polytrope with an index of 0.5, coupled with a formulation of the compressive strength of dust aggregates. The lowest-density trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) and main-belt asteroids (MBAs) are well reproduced by dust aggregates composed of 0.1 μm sized grains. However, most TNOs, MBAs, comets, and near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) exhibit higher densities, suggesting the influence of compaction mechanisms such as collision, dust grain disruption, sintering, or melting, leading to further growth. We speculate that there are two potential formation paths for small solar system bodies. One involves the direct coagulation of primordial dust grains, resulting in the formation of first-generation planetesimals, including the lowest-density TNOs, MBAs, and the parent bodies of comets and NEAs. In this case, comets and NEAs are fragments or rubble piles of first-generation planetesimals, and the objects themselves or the rubble are composed of 0.1 μm sized grains. The other path involves the further potential fragmentation of first-generation planetesimals into the compact dust aggregates observed in protoplanetary disks, resulting in the formation of second-generation planetesimals composed of compact dust aggregates, which may contribute to explaining another formation process of comets and NEAs.

<div> 竞争吸积，单体核坍缩，星团形成，模拟，空间分布
<br />
通过研究星团形成的平滑粒子流体动力学模拟，科学家发现竞争吸积模型预测的最大恒星应该在相对密度更高、或者位于更深的引力潜井中，只有在没有反馈的模拟中才符合这一预测。而当反馈效应被考虑时，只有一半的模拟中最大恒星位于更深的引力潜井内，且在空间分布上没有其他明显信号。此外，对于单体核坍缩的简单模型来说，最大恒星可能也会位于更深的引力潜井中。因此，无法通过最大恒星的空间分布来明确区分形成机制，需要其他预测来区分竞争吸积和单体坍缩。（总结：竞争吸积和单体核坍缩形成的恒星在空间分布上没有明显差异，需要其他特征来区分形成机制。） <div>
The two main competing theories proposed to explain the formation of massive (>10 M⊙) stars—competitive accretion and monolithic core collapse—make different observable predictions for the environment of the massive stars during, and immediately after, their formation. Proponents of competitive accretion have long predicted that the most massive stars should have a different spatial distribution to lower-mass stars, through the stars being either mass segregated or being in areas of higher relative densities or sitting deeper in gravitational potential wells. We test these predictions by analyzing a suite of smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulations where star clusters form massive stars via competitive accretion with and without feedback. We find that the most massive stars have higher relative densities, and sit in deeper potential wells, only in simulations in which feedback is not present. When feedback is included, only half of the simulations have the massive stars residing in deeper potential wells, and there are no other distinguishing signals in their spatial distributions. Intriguingly, in our simple models for monolithic core collapse, the massive stars may also end up in deeper potential wells because if massive cores fragment then the stars that form are also massive, and dominate their local environs. We find no robust diagnostic test in the spatial distributions of massive stars that can distinguish their formation mechanisms, and so other predictions for distinguishing between competitive accretion and monolithic collapse are required.

<title>Observational Test of f(Q) Gravity with Weak Gravitational Lensing</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad6c4d</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this article we confront a class of f(Q) gravity models with observational data of galaxy–galaxy lensing. Specifically, we consider f(Q) gravity models containing a small quadratic correction when compared with general relativity (GR), and quantify this correction by a model parameter, α. To derive the observational constraints, we start by extracting spherically symmetric solutions, which correspond to deviations from the Schwarzschild solution that depends on the model parameters in a twofold way, i.e., a renormalized mass and a new term proportional to r−2. Then, we calculate the effective lensing potential, the deflection angle, the shear component, and the effective excess surface density profile. After that, we employ a group catalog and a shape catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 for the lens and source samples, respectively. Moreover, we handle the off-center radius as a free parameter and constrain it using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. Concerning the deviation parameter from GR we derive at the 1σ confidence level, and then compare the fitting efficiency with the standard Λ cold dark matter paradigm by applying the Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion. Our results indicate that the f(Q) corrections alongside the off-center effect yield a scenario that is slightly favored.

<title>The Role of Meridional Flow in the Generation of Solar/Stellar Magnetic Fields and Cycles</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad7027</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad7027</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Meridional flow is crucial in generating the solar poloidal magnetic field by facilitating poleward transport of the field from decayed bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs). As the meridional circulation changes with the stellar rotation rate, the properties of stellar magnetic cycles are expected to be influenced by this flow. In this study, we explore the role of meridional flow in generating magnetic fields in the Sun and Sun-like stars using the STABLE (surface flux transport and Babcock–Leighton) dynamo model. We find that a moderate meridional flow increases the polar field by efficiently driving the trailing polarity flux toward the pole, while a strong flow tends to transport both polarities of BMRs poleward, potentially reducing the polar field. Our findings are in perfect agreement with what one can expect from the surface flux transport model. Similarly, the toroidal field initially increases with moderate flow speeds and then decreases beyond a certain value. This trend is due to the competitive effects of shearing and diffusion. Furthermore, our study highlights the impact of meridional flow on the strength and duration of stellar cycles. By including the meridional flow from a mean-field hydrodynamics model in STABLE, we show that the magnetic field strength initially increases with the stellar rotation rate and then declines in rapidly rotating stars, offering an explanation of the observed variation of stellar magnetic field with rotation rate.

<title>Molecular Distribution in the Central Region of M87</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The central region of M87 has been observed by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) several times to resolve its molecular cloud distribution. We present the ALMA CO(1–0), CO(2–1), and CO(3–2) observations of the M87 circumnuclear region. The CO(1–0) shows emission as well as molecular absorption features toward its nucleus, indicating the existence of cold molecular clouds/gas. ALMA imaging of the CO(1–0) observations show the distribution of molecular clouds toward the nucleus of M87 with a radius of ∼105 pc. The clouds seen in the CO(1–0) are moving with very high velocity and have an apparent motion in the range of −1000 to 3600 km s−1 relative to the central supermassive black hole, which has a systemic velocity of ∼1266 km s−1. The molecular gas mass was estimated to be about 1.08 ± 0.64 × 107M⊙ in the central 210 pc of M87. We calculated the optical depths using the absorption lines of the CO(1–0) and CO(2–1). The excitation temperature was estimated to be ∼7.133 ± 0.03 K using the optical depth ratio of the CO(2-1) to CO(1-0). We also found the line-of-sight column density to be ∼2.25 × 1015 cm−2, which corresponds to a hydrogen column density of ∼0.28 × 1020 cm−2.

<title>Subhalos in Galaxy Clusters: Coherent Accretion and Internal Orbits</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Subhalo dynamics in galaxy cluster host halos govern the observed distribution and properties of cluster member galaxies. We use the IllustrisTNG simulation to investigate the accretion and orbits of subhalos found in cluster-size halos. We find that the median change in the major axis direction of cluster-size host halos is approximately 80° between a ∼ 0.1 and the present day. We identify coherent regions in the angular distribution of subhalo accretion, and ∼68% of accreted subhalos enter their host halo through ∼38% of the surface area at the virial radius. The majority of galaxy clusters in the sample have ∼2 such coherent regions. We further measure angular orbits of subhalos with respect to the host major axis and use a clustering algorithm to identify distinct orbit modes with varying oscillation timescales. The orbit modes correlate with subhalo accretion conditions. Subhalos in orbit modes with shorter oscillations tend to have lower peak masses and accretion directions somewhat more aligned with the major axis. One orbit mode, exhibiting the least oscillatory behavior, largely consists of subhalos that accrete near the plane perpendicular to the host halo major axis. Our findings are consistent with expectations from inflow from major filament structures and internal dynamical friction: most subhalos accrete through coherent regions, and more massive subhalos experience fewer orbits after accretion. Our work offers a unique quantification of subhalo dynamics that can be connected to how the intracluster medium strips and quenches cluster galaxies.

The ability to accurately discern active massive black holes (BHs) in nearby dwarf galaxies is paramount to understanding the origins and processes of “seed” BHs in the early Universe. We present Chandra X-ray Observatory observations of a sample of three local dwarf galaxies (M* ≤ 3 × 109M⊙, z ≤ 0.15) previously identified as candidates for hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN). The galaxies were selected from the NASA-Sloan Atlas with spatially coincident X-ray detections in the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey. Our new Chandra data reveal three X-ray point sources in two of the target galaxies with luminosities between log(L2−10 keV [erg s−1]) = 39.1 and 40.4. Our results support the presence of an AGN in these two galaxies and an ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) in one of them. For the AGNs, we estimate BH masses of MBH ∼ 105−6M⊙ and Eddington ratios on the order of ∼10−3.

<title>The Remarkable X-Ray Spectra and Variability of the Ultraluminous Weak-line Quasar SDSS J1521+5202</title>

We present a focused X-ray and multiwavelength study of the ultraluminous weak-line quasar (WLQ) SDSS J1521+5202, one of the few X-ray weak WLQs that is amenable to basic X-ray spectral and variability investigations. J1521+5202 shows striking X-ray variability during 2006–2023, by up to a factor of ≈32 in 0.5–2 keV flux, and our new 2023 Chandra observation caught it in its brightest X-ray flux state to date. Concurrent infrared/optical observations show only mild variability. The 2023 Chandra spectrum can be acceptably described by a power law with intrinsic X-ray absorption, and it reveals a nominal intrinsic level of X-ray emission relative to its optical/ultraviolet emission. In contrast, an earlier Chandra spectrum from 2013 shows apparent spectral complexity that is not well fit by a variety of models, including ionized absorption or standard Compton-reflection models. Overall, the observations are consistent with the thick-disk plus outflow model previously advanced for WLQs, where a nominal level of underlying X-ray emission plus variable absorption leads to the remarkable observed X-ray variability. In the case of J1521+5202, it appears likely that the outflow, and not the thick disk itself, lies along our line of sight and causes the X-ray absorption.

Blazars exhibit multiwavelength variability, a phenomenon whose underlying mechanisms remain elusive. This study investigates the origin of such variability through leptonic blazar emission simulations, focusing on stochastic fluctuations in environmental parameters. By analyzing the spectral indices of the power spectral densities of the variability, we assess their relationship with the underlying fluctuations. Our findings reveal that the variability spectral indices remain almost independent of the variations responsible for their emergence. This suggests a complex interplay of factors contributing to the observed multiwavelength variability in blazars.

This work introduces advanced computational techniques for modeling the time evolution of compact binary systems using machine learning. The dynamics of compact binary systems, such as black holes and neutron stars, present significant nonlinear challenges due to the strong gravitational interactions and the requirement for precise numerical simulations. Traditional methods, like the post-Newtonian approximation, often require significant computational resources and face challenges in accuracy and efficiency. Here, we employed machine learning algorithms, including deep learning models like long short-term memory (LSTM) and temporal convolutional network (TCN), to predict the future evolution of these systems based on extensive simulation data. Our results demonstrate that employing both LSTM and TCN even as black-box predictors for sequence prediction can also significantly improve the prediction accuracy without physics-informed neural networks (as partial differential equation solvers with prior knowledge or inductive bias. By employing LSTM and TCN, we obtained R2 values of 99.74% and 99.19% for the evolutionary orbits of the compact binaries data set, respectively. Our models demonstrate the ability to effectively capture the dynamics of the binaries, achieving high prediction performance with significantly reduced computational overhead by a factor of 40, compared to conventional numerical methods. This study paves the way for more effective and computationally scalable approaches to the understanding of gravitational phenomena and predictive modeling in gravitational-wave astronomy.

<div> NGC 5253, spatially resolved, multiphase gas, abundances, star-forming clusters
总结:
NGC 5253是一个蓝色紧凑矮星系，进行了空间分辨的多相气体丰度研究，通过在Hubble空间望远镜的COS点ings和光学大型望远镜MUSE观测相结合，对星形成区进行了研究。研究发现中性气体的丰度明显低于电离气体，化学丰度与半径和年龄相关，N，O和N/O的丰度随年龄变化的规律与电离气体和中性气体有所不同，这提供了不同化学丰度形成的证据。 <div>
We present a pioneering, spatially resolved, multiphase gas abundance study on the blue compact dwarf galaxy NGC 5253, targeting 10 star-forming (SF) clusters inside six far-UV (FUV) Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) pointings with cospatial optical Very Large Telescope/MUSE observations throughout the galaxy. The SF regions span a wide range of ages (1–15 Myr) and are distributed at different radii (50–230 pc). We performed a robust absorption-line profile fitting on the COS spectra, covering 1065–1430 Å in the FUV, allowing an accurate computation of neutral-gas abundances for 13 different ions sampling eight elements. These values were then compared with the ionized-gas abundances, measured using the direct method on MUSE integrated spectra inside analog COS apertures. Our multiphase, spatially resolved comparisons find abundances, which are lower in the neutral gas than the ionized gas by 0.22, 0.80, and 0.58 dex for log(O/H), log(N/H), and log(N/O), respectively. We modeled the chemical abundance distributions and evaluated correlations as a function of the radius and age. It was found that, while N, O, and N/O abundances decrease as a function of age in the ionized gas, they increase with age in the neutral gas. No strong correlations for N, O, or N/O were observed as a function of the radius. The N/O and N/H offsets between the phases were found to decrease with age, providing evidence that chemical enrichment happens differentially, first in the ionized-gas phase around 2–5 Myrs (due to N-rich Wolf–Rayet stars) and then mixing out into the cold neutral gas on longer timescales of 10–15 Myr.

<title>A Precessing Stellar Disk Model for Superorbital Modulations of the Gamma-Ray Binary LS I+61° 303</title>

<div> LS I+61° 303, gamma-ray binary, neutron star, Be star, superorbital modulation<br />
总结:<br />
这篇文章研究了伽马射线双星LS I+61° 303，发现其除了轨道调制外还存在长期的光变化，可能由Be星盘的进动引起。通过分析计算得到了望远镜观测数据的合理解释，认为X射线可能来自于星际震荡的同步辐射，而X射线的轨道相位漂移和长期光变的拟合结果表明中子星可能在小离心率轨道上围绕Be星运动。与其他Be/X射线双星的Corbet图相比较，发现其中子星的潮汐力可能诱导了LS I+61° 303中Be星盘的进动。 <div>
Gamma-ray binary LS I+61° 303 consists of a neutron star orbiting around a Be star with a period of Porb ≃ 26.5 days. Apart from orbital modulations, the binary shows long-term flux variations with a superorbital period of as seen in nearly all wavelengths. The origin of this superorbital modulation is still not well understood. Under the pulsar wind–stellar outflow interaction scenario, we propose that the superorbital modulations of LS I+61° 303 could be caused by the precession of the Be disk. Assuming X-rays arise from synchrotron radiation of the intrabinary shock, we develop an analytical model to calculate expected flux modulations over the orbital and superorbital phases. The asymmetric two-peak profiles in orbital light curves and sinusoidal-like long-term modulations are reproduced under the precessing disk scenario. The observed orbital phase drifting of the X-ray peak and our fitting of long-term X-ray data indicate that the neutron star is likely orbiting around the star with a small eccentricity and periastron phase around Φp ∼ 0.6. We compare the Corbet diagrams of LS I+61° 303 with other Be/X-ray binaries, and the linear correlation in the diagram suggests that the precession of the Be disk in LS I+61° 303 is induced by the tidal torque of its neutron star companion.

<br /><br />总结:
通过对G1.9+0.3超新星遗迹的13年观测发现，该遗迹的亮度在不断增加，但空间上存在着很大的变化率差异，可能是由于爆炸波的演化、等离子团的扩张或压缩、磁场湍流或磁场角度的变化引起的。同时，对磁场强度和最大粒子能量进行了推测，并得出了爆炸日期和冲击效率因子等参数。然而，不同模型的光子指数随时间的变化可以对其进行验证。 <div>
We report 13 years of Chandra monitoring of the youngest Galactic supernova remnant G1.9+0.3, the only remnant known to be increasing in brightness. We confirm the spatially integrated rate of flux increase of (1.2 ± 0.2)% yr−1 (1–7 keV), but find large spatial variations, from −3% yr−1 to +7% yr−1, over length scales as small as 10″ or smaller. We observe relatively little change in spectral slope, though one region shows significant hardening as it brightens by 1% yr−1. Such rates of change can be accommodated by any of several explanations, including steady blast-wave evolution, expansion or compression of discrete plasma blobs, magnetic turbulence, or variations in magnetic-field aspect angle. Our results do not constrain the mean magnetic-field strength, but a self-consistent picture can be produced in which the maximum particle energies are limited by the remnant age (applying both to electrons and to ions) to about 20 TeV, and the remnant-averaged magnetic-field strength is about 30 μG. The deceleration parameter m (average shock radius varying as tm) is about 0.7, consistent with estimates from overall expansion dynamics and confirming an explosion date of about 1900 CE. Shock-efficiency factors ϵe and ϵB (fractions of shock energy in relativistic electrons and magnetic field) are 0.003 and 0.0002 in this picture. However, the large range of rates of brightness change indicates that such a global model is oversimplified. Temporal variations of photon index, expected to be small but measurable with longer time baselines, can discriminate among possible models.

<div> LSB galaxies, edge-on orientation, spectroscopic measurements, gas metallicity, mergers<br />
<br />总结:<br />该研究详细研究了四个低表面亮度(LSB)星系的来源，这些星系具有大面积的边缘观测到的盘。他们采用了深度成像和长条光谱，对LSB盘的结构参数和星体成分进行了表征，发现了气体金属丰度梯度较为平缓，LSB盘的恒星速度分散和厚度表明了动态过热的现象。观察结果倾向于支持合并作为形成大质量LSB星系的关键阶段。 <div>
To understand the origin of extended disks of low-surface brightness (LSB) galaxies, we studied in detail four such systems with large disks seen edge on. Two of them are edge-on giant LSB galaxies (gLSBGs) recently identified by our team. The edge-on orientation of these systems boosts their surface brightnesses that provided an opportunity to characterize stellar populations spectroscopically and yielded the first such measurements for edge-on gLSBGs. We collected deep images of one galaxy using the 1.4 m Milanković Telescope, which we combined with the archival Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam and DESI Legacy Surveys data available for the three other systems, and measured the structural parameters of the disks. We acquired deep long-slit spectra with the Russian 6 m telescope and the 10 m Keck II telescope and estimated stellar population properties in the high-surface brightness and LSB regions as well as the gas-phase metallicity distribution. The gas metallicity gradients are shallow to flat in the range between 0 and −0.03 dex per exponential disk scale length, which is consistent with the extrapolation of the gradient–scale length relation for smaller disk galaxies. Our estimates of stellar velocity dispersion in the LSB disks as well as the relative thickness of the disks indicate the dynamical overheating. Our observations favor mergers as the essential stage in the formation scenario for massive LSB galaxies.

总结: 该研究利用IXPE进行螃蟹星的X射线偏振测量，发现偏振角度呈S形变化，并揭示了与光学偏振不同的辐射机制。在内部星云中观察到的偏振地图显示了环形磁场结构，同时发现南部射流中磁场方向相对射流轴的变化和偏振度的减小。这些观察结果可能由射流中的扭结不稳定性或与高密度介质碰撞引起。通过光谱偏振分析发现内部星云四个象限的不对称偏振，与预期的环形磁场几何形状相符，并且偏振度与光子指数呈空间相关。 <div>
We present Crab X-ray polarization measurements using Imaging X-Ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) data with a total exposure of 300 ks, three times more than the initial 2022 discovery paper. Polarization is detected in three times more pulsar phase bins, revealing an S-shaped +40° polarization angle sweep in the main pulse and >1σ departures from the OPTIMA optical polarization in both pulses, suggesting different radiation mechanisms or sites for the polarized emission at the two wavebands. Our polarization map of the inner nebula reveals a toroidal magnetic field, as seen in prior IXPE analyses. Along the southern jet, the magnetic field orientation relative to the jet axis changes from perpendicular to parallel and the polarization degree decreases by ∼6%. These observations may be explained by kink instabilities along the jet or a collision with a dense, jet-deflecting medium at the tip. Using spectropolarimetric analysis, we find asymmetric polarization in the four quadrants of the inner nebula, as expected for a toroidal field geometry, and a spatial correlation between polarization degree and photon index.

<title>Constraints on the Gas-phase C/O Ratio of DR Tau's Outer Disk from CS, SO, and C2H Observations</title>

<div> Class II protoplanetary disks, millimeter wavelength observations, hydrocarbons, gas-phase C/O ratio, DR Tau
总结:<br /><br />本研究利用NOEMA观测了DR Tau原行星盘，发现了较低的CS/SO比值以及异常的SO排布结构。通过热化学模型计算，结果表明DR Tau的低CS/SO比值和微弱的C2H发射可以通过盘中气相C/O比小于1来解释。与13CO结构图的比较结果表明，迟期的物质输入可能导致其盘的气相C/O比降低。 <div>
Millimeter wavelength observations of Class II protoplanetary disks often display strong emission from hydrocarbons and high CS/SO values, providing evidence that the gas-phase C/O ratio commonly exceeds 1 in their outer regions. We present new NOEMA observations of CS 5–4, SO 76–65 and 56–45, C2H N = 3–2, HCN 3–2, HCO+ 3–2, and H13CO+ 3–2 in the DR Tau protoplanetary disk at a resolution of ∼0.″4 (80 au). Estimates for the disk-averaged CS/SO ratio range from ∼0.4 to 0.5, the lowest value reported thus far for a T Tauri disk. At a projected separation of ∼180 au northeast of the star, the SO moment maps exhibit a clump that has no counterpart in the other lines, and the CS/SO value decreases to <0.2 at its location. Thermochemical models calculated with DALI indicate that DR Tau’s low CS/SO ratio and faint C2H emission can be explained by a gas-phase C/O ratio that is <1 at the disk radii traced by NOEMA. Comparisons of DR Tau’s SO emission to maps of extended structures traced by 13CO suggest that late infall may contribute to driving down the gas-phase C/O ratio of its disk.

总结: 
本研究调查了太阳风中阿尔文波中磁场扭曲对质子和阿尔法粒子的影响，重点研究了一个孤立的大尺度磁场扭曲，并详细研究了离子的动力学特性。我们发现在磁场扭曲内，质子和阿尔法粒子密度增加，表明存在波动活动。有趣的是，我们观察到磁场扭曲与阿尔法粒子温度之间存在明显的相关性，而与质子温度没有发现相关性。这表明磁场扭曲可能在优先加热重离子上发挥作用。我们的结果表明磁场扭曲可能导致质子速度分布函数的变形，而阿尔法粒子的优先加热效应可能是由于更密集的次级束和更小的束-核相对漂移速度所致。 <div>
We investigate how ions, namely protons and alpha particles, kinetically react to the presence of strong deflections in the magnetic field, the so-called switchbacks, in the first stream of slow Alfvénic wind observed by Solar Orbiter at the heliocentric distance of 0.64 au. We focus on an isolated, large-scale switchback, and we study in detail ion kinetic properties. Beyond the expected correlation between the magnetic deflection and ion velocity related to the Alfvénic nature of the switchbacks, we find that, within the switchback, proton and alpha particle densities increase, suggesting ongoing wave activity. Very interestingly, we observe a clear correlation between the magnetic deflection and alpha particle temperature, while no correlation has been found with proton temperature. This is an indication of a possible role played by switchbacks in preferentially heating heavy ions. Our results suggest that the presence of switchbacks can induce a deformation of the proton velocity distribution function, while the preferential heating of alpha particles could be due to a denser secondary beam and a smaller relative drift speed between the beam and core.

<title>MOSEL Survey: Spatially Offset Lyman-continuum Emission in a New Emitter at z = 3.088 Can Explain the Low Number Density of Observed LyC Leakers</title>

<br />
这篇文章报道了一项独特的Lyman-continuum（LyC）发射体的发现，其红移为z = 3.088。使用哈勃空间望远镜WFC3/UVIS F336W滤镜检测到了LyC发射，其信噪比为3.9。通过结合詹姆斯·韦伯空间望远镜（JWST）JADES、FRESCO和JEMS调查的成像和光谱数据，以及MXDF调查的VLT/MUSE数据，估计了与干扰者星系引起LyC发射的随机排列的概率小于6×10^-5。星系内的星际介质（ISM）条件类似于高红移处其他LyC发射者的条件，尽管单峰的Lyα谱线和缺乏的光学紫外线发射线表明星际介质为光学厚。观测结果表明LyC光子是通过一个狭窄的光学薄中性ISM锥体泄漏出来的，很可能是由过去的并合事件造成的。使用个体泄漏者的逃逸分数的限制和一个简单的模型，估计了电离锥体的开口半角可以小至16°（2%电离分数），从而再现一些理论关于星系平均逃逸分数的约束。所需的狭窄开口角可以解释已确认的LyC泄漏者数量较低的原因。 <br /><br />总结: Lyman-continuum发射体的发现，高红移区域，通过多个望远镜观测获得数据，LyC光子泄漏，星系内的星际介质条件，电离锥体的开口角。 <div>
We present the discovery of a unique Lyman-continuum (LyC) emitter at z = 3.088. The LyC emission was detected using the Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/UVIS F336W filter, covering a rest-frame wavelength range of 760–900 Å. The peak signal-to-noise ratio of LyC emission is 3.9 in an r = 0.″24 aperture and is spatially offset by 0.″29 ± 0.″04 (∼2.2 ± 0.3 kpc) from the peak of rest-UV emission (F606W). By combining imaging and spectroscopic data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) JADES, FRESCO, and JEMS surveys, along with VLT/MUSE data from the MXDF survey, we estimate that the probability of random alignment with an interloper galaxy causing the LyC emission is less than 6 × 10−5. The interstellar medium (ISM) conditions in the galaxy are similar to those in other LyC emitters at high redshift ( , , O32 = 0.63 ± 0.03), although the single-peaked Lyα profile and lack of rest-UV emission lines suggest an optically thick ISM. Our observations indicate that LyC photons are leaking through a narrow cone of optically thin neutral ISM, most likely created by a past merger (as evidenced by medium-band F210M and F182M images). Using the constraints on escape fraction from individual leakers and a simple model, we estimate that the opening half-angle of ionization cones can be as small as 16° (2% ionized fraction) to reproduce some of the theoretical constraints on the average escape fraction for galaxies. The narrow opening angle required can explain the low number density of confirmed LyC leakers.

<br />总结: <br />这篇文章使用了分析框架来计算二进制轨道在一个考虑了吸积盘风的物理模型下的演化情况。他们发现盘风引起的角动量损失始终大于标准模型中因为吸积盘周围各个方向的质量流失而引起的角动量损失。在大多数情况下，考虑盘风的影响会导致轨道间距显著减小，差异可达60%。因此，文章得出结论，在演化二进制轨道时，考虑吸积盘风引起的角动量损失是非常重要的。 <div>
We use an analytic framework to calculate the evolution of binary orbits under a physically motivated model that accounts for angular momentum loss associated with winds from an accretion disk around the compact-objected accretor. Our prescription considers wind mass ejection from the surface of an accretion disk, accounting for a radial mass-loss dependence across the disk surface. We compare this to the standard prescription of angular momentum loss associated with isotropic mass loss from the vicinity of the accretor. The angular momentum loss from a disk wind is always larger. For mass ratios, q, between 2 and 10, angular momentum loss via a disk wind can be ≃3–40 times greater than the standard prescription. For the majority of mass ratios and disk properties, accounting for the disk wind can result in considerably smaller orbital separations compared to the standard formalism, the differences being ≃60% depending on how long the effect is integrated for. We conclude that it is important to consider the effects of angular momentum loss from a disk wind when evolving binary orbits.

这项研究探讨了行星形成盘中挥发性物质在冰层中的夹持效率，发现夹持效率与冰层厚度没有明显关联。通过温度程序脱附实验发现，微观冰层中的夹持对于H2O和CO2冰矩阵以及N2和Ar等超挥发性物质来说，对冰层厚度并不敏感。研究推测这可能与冰层表面的裂缝等特征有关，导致超挥发物质从深层冰层中逸出。因此在原行星盘中，我们可以预期各种颗粒大小的冰粒中都会有高效的夹持发生。 <br /><br />总结: <br />挥发性物质在行星形成盘中的夹持效率取决于冰层厚度，但对于微观冰层（大约50 ML以上）中的挥发性物质而言，其夹持效率与冰层厚度关系不大。超挥发性物质在冰层中的夹持也表现出相似的趋势。这可能是由于冰层表面特征导致超挥发性物质从深层冰层中逸出。因此，我们可以预期在原行星盘中，各种颗粒大小的冰粒中都会有高效的夹持发生。 <div>
The volatile inventories of planets depend on the precise partitioning of different volatiles between the gas and solid phases across the planet birth disk. For the case of hyper-volatiles (e.g., CO, N2, and noble gases), the partitioning also depends on how efficiently they are trapped into less volatile ice matrices. The thicknesses of these ice matrices can range from a few molecular layers to macroscopic bodies, and in this study we explore how entrapment efficiency depends on the ice thickness between tens of nanometers and a few micrometers (∼50–3000 monolayers, ML). We carry out a series of temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments on H2O:CO and CO2:CO mixtures with 5:1 and 15:1 matrix-to-CO mixing ratios. Entrapment efficiencies range from 41% to 64%, with higher entrapment efficiencies for the more dilute ices. Surprisingly, we find no significant difference in entrapment across the studied ice thicknesses for either H2O or CO2 ice matrices. Complementary TPD experiments with the additional hyper-volatiles N2 and Ar see a similar trend with ice thickness. We speculate that these results may be due to surface topography such as cracks that lead to hyper-volatile escape from deep ice layers. In either case, these experiments show that entrapment in microscopic ices is relatively insensitive to ice thickness (above ∼50 ML). In protoplanetary disks we therefore expect efficient entrapment in icy grains of a range of grain sizes.

A stellar-mass black hole surrounded by the neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF) has been proposed as the central engine of gamma-ray bursts. In this work, we investigate the neutrino/antineutrino luminosity and annihilation luminosity from the NDAF and pair annihilation model, taking into account the neutrino oscillation above the accretion disk. The disk's hydrodynamical properties are modeled using an empirical solution previously derived with boundary conditions, including the effect of electron degeneracy and neutrino trapping. Our key parameters are the mass accretion rate and the black hole spin given in the ranges of –10 M⊙ s−1 and 0 ≤ a < 1, respectively. Without neutrino oscillation, the obtained neutrino/antineutrino luminosity is ∼1051–1053 erg s−1, while the neutrino annihilation luminosity is found to be ∼1046–1051 erg s−1. In the presence of neutrino oscillation in the vacuum limit, the electron neutrino annihilation luminosity decreases by ≲22% through the flavor transformation, while the muon and tau neutrino luminosity can increase by up to ∼45% and 60%, respectively. As a result, the total annihilation luminosity can be reduced by up to ∼19% due to the oscillation process above the disk. Finally, we also investigate the case whereby the charge-conjugation-parity-symmetry-violating (CP-violating) phase is changed from δCP = 0° to 245°. However, our results reveal that the CP-violating phase has minimal impact on the neutrino annihilation luminosity.

Solar active regions (ARs) are the main sources of flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). NOAA AR 12089, which emerged on 2014 June 10, produced two C-class flares accompanied by CMEs within 5 hr after its emergence. When producing the two eruptive flares, the total unsigned magnetic flux (ΦAR) and magnetic free energy (Ef) of the AR are much smaller than the common CME-producing ARs. Why can this extremely small AR produce eruptive flares so early? We compare the AR magnetic environment for the eruptive flares to that for the largest confined flare from the AR. In addition to the ΦAR and Ef, we calculate the ratio between the mean characteristic twist parameter (αFPIL) within the flaring polarity inversion line (FPIL) region and ΦAR, a parameter considering both background magnetic field constraint and nonpotentiality of the core region, for the three flares. We find higher αFPIL/ΦAR values during the eruptive flares than during the confined flare. Furthermore, we compute the decay index along the polarity inversion line, revealing values of 1.69, 3.45, and 0.98 before the two eruptive and the confined flares, respectively. Finally, nonlinear force-free field extrapolation indicates that a flux rope was repeatedly formed along the FPIL before eruptive flares, which ejected out and produced CMEs. No flux rope was found before the confined flare. Our research suggests that even a newly emerged, extremely small AR can produce eruptive flares if it has sufficiently weak background field constraint and strong nonpotentiality in the core region.

未来的远程观测可能会检测到外行星大气中放射性元素的存在，这些放射性元素可能源自宇宙或地质，也可能来自工业源。它们的探测将揭示有关行星地质或空间环境的重要性质，并有可能作为技术标志。然而，很多放射性元素无法通过远程方法进行表征。目前的远程光谱观测任务概念在紫外到中红外波段对于放射性元素的存在并不敏感，因此未来更有可能通过飞掠或探测任务提供这些数据。 <div>
The characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres through transit spectra is becoming increasingly feasible, and technology for direct detection remains ongoing. The possibility of detecting spectral features could enable quantitative constraints on atmospheric composition or even serve as a potential biosignature, with the sensitivity of the instrument and observation time as key limiting factors. This paper discusses the possibility that future remote observations could detect the presence of radioactive elements in the atmospheres of exoplanets. Such radionuclides could arise from cosmogenic or geologic sources, as well as from industrial sources, all of which occur on Earth. The detection of radionuclides in an exoplanetary atmosphere could reveal important properties about the planet’s geology or space environment and potentially could serve as a technosignature. However, many radionuclides, including those from industrial sources, attach to aerosol or other particles that cannot be remotely characterized. Limited experimental and theoretical spectral data exist for long-lived radionuclides, but the sensitivity required to detect the spectral features of some known radionuclides would be at least several orders of magnitude greater than required to detect the spectral features of molecular oxygen. Present-day remote spectroscopic observing mission concepts at ultraviolet to mid-infrared wavelengths are not sensitive to discern the presence of radionuclides in exoplanetary atmospheres. Interplanetary fly-by or probe missions may be more likely to provide such data in the future.

总结: 
氦新星是指白矮星吸积来自氦星伴侣的氢贫物质，氦包层质量达到临界值时会引发不稳定的氦燃烧，触发新星爆发。在早期爆发阶段，会出现明亮的软X射线相，称为X射线闪耀。通过理论光变曲线模拟发现，氦新星的X射线闪耀持续时间长（100天至10年），X射线亮度高（约10^38爱尔/秒），因此可以作为新型X射线瞬变体或持续X射线源进行探测。X射线闪耀是光学亮化的前兆，因此探测氦新星的X射线闪耀可以帮助规划观测光学前最大相，这一直是新星研究的前沿之一。文献中提到了一个可能的氦燃烧X射线闪耀候选天体。这个X射线瞬变源与1.35太阳质量的白矮星的X射线闪耀模型一致。 <div>
A helium nova occurs on a white dwarf (WD) accreting hydrogen-deficient matter from a helium star companion. When the mass of a helium envelope on the WD reaches a critical value, unstable helium burning ignites to trigger a nova outburst. A bright soft X-ray phase appears in an early outbursting phase of a helium nova before it optically rises toward maximum. Such an X-ray bright phase is called the X-ray flash. We present theoretical light curves of X-ray flashes for 1.0, 1.2, and 1.35 M☉ helium novae with mass accretion rates of (1.6–7.5) × 10−7M☉ yr−1. Long durations of the X-ray flashes (100 days–10 yr) and high X-ray luminosities (∼1038 erg s−1) indicate that X-ray flashes are detectable as a new type of X-ray transient or persistent X-ray sources. An X-ray flash is a precursor of optical brightening, so that the detection of X-ray flashes on helium novae enables us to plan arranged observation for optical premaximum phases that have been one of the frontiers of the study of novae. We found a candidate object of helium-burning X-ray flash from the literature on extragalactic X-ray surveys. This X-ray transient source is consistent with our X-ray flash model of a 1.35 M⊙ WD.

The cosmic variance on the star formation history may lead to bias in the merger rate density estimation of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers by compact binary population synthesis. In this paper, we take advantage of the large box size of the Millennium Simulation combined with the semianalytic galaxy formation model GABE and the parameterized population binary star evolution model to examine how much effect the cosmic variance will introduce on the estimation of the merger rate density of BNS mergers. We find that for subbox sizes of 100 and 200 Mpc, the variance of merger rate density σR/R at different redshifts is about 23%–35% and 13%–20%, respectively. On the one hand, as for the variance of the detection rate on BNS mergers with the current LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA (LVK) detector network, this value is very small at ≲10%, which indicates ignoring the cosmic variance is reasonable for estimating the merger rate density from current LVK observations. On the other hand, with next-generation gravitational wave detectors, it is possible to localize BNS mergers within subboxes possessing a length of 40 Mpc for a source redshift zs < 0.2. In such a small box, the cosmic variance of the merger rate density is significant, i.e., the value of σR/R is about ∼55%. This hints that estimating the merger rate density of BNS in different sky areas may provide useful information on the cosmic variance.

<title>The Dustiest Galactic S Stars: Mid-infrared Spectra from SOFIA/FORCAST</title>

We present spectra of 12 of the reddest, and hence dustiest, S stars in the Milky Way, observed with the FORCAST grisms on SOFIA. S stars are asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with C/O ∼ 1, so their molecular and dust chemistries are dominated by neither O nor C, often leading to atypical spectral features from their molecules and dust grains. All of the stars in our sample have strong dust emission features at 10–11 μm, but the shape of the feature in most of the stars differs from the shapes commonly observed in either oxygen-rich or carbon-rich AGB stars. Two stars also show the 13 μm feature associated with crystalline alumina. Two have a water absorption band at ∼6.5–7.5 μm, and a third has a tentative detection, but only one of these three has the more common SiO absorption band at 7.5 μm. Three others show a red 6.3 μm emission feature from complex hydrocarbons consistent with “Class C” objects, and in a fourth it appears at 6.37 μm, redder than even the standard Class C hydrocarbon feature. Class C spectra typically indicate complex hydrocarbons that have been less processed by UV radiation, resulting in more aliphatic bonds relative to aromatic bonds. None of the S stars show a strong 11.3 μm hydrocarbon feature, which is also consistent with the presence of aliphatic hydrocarbons.

<title>Caught in the Act: Observations of the Double-mode RR Lyrae V338 Boo during the Disappearance of a Pulsation Mode</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
New results on the behavior of the double-mode RR Lyrae V338 Boo are presented. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observed this star again in 2022, and an observing campaign of the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) was completed after the TESS observations as a follow-up. We find that the first overtone pulsation mode in this star completely disappears during the TESS observing window. This mode reappears at the end of the TESS observations, and the AAVSO observing campaign shows that in the months that followed, the first overtone mode was not only present but was the dominant mode of pulsation. This star, and potentially others like it, could hold the key to finally solving the mystery of the Blazhko effect in RR Lyrae.

<title>The Independence of Magnetic Turbulent Power Spectra to the Presence of Switchbacks in the Inner Heliosphere</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An outstanding gap in our knowledge of the solar wind is the relationship between switchbacks and solar wind turbulence. Switchbacks are large fluctuations, even reversals, of the background magnetic field embedded in the solar wind flow. It has been proposed that switchbacks may form as a product of turbulence and decay via coupling with the turbulent cascade. In this work, we examine how properties of solar wind magnetic field turbulence vary in the presence or absence of switchbacks. Specifically, we use in situ particle and fields measurements from Parker Solar Probe to measure magnetic field turbulent wave power, separately in the inertial and kinetic ranges, as a function of switchback magnetic deflection angle. We demonstrate that the angle between the background magnetic field and the solar wind velocity in the spacecraft frame (θvB) strongly determines whether Parker Solar Probe samples wave power parallel or perpendicular to the background magnetic field. Further, we show that θvB is strongly modulated by the switchback magnetic deflection angle. In this analysis, we demonstrate that switchback deflection angle does not correspond to any significant increase in wave power in either the inertial range or at kinetic scales. This result implies that switchbacks do not strongly couple to the turbulent cascade in the inertial or kinetic ranges via turbulent wave–particle interactions. Therefore, we do not expect switchbacks to contribute significantly to solar wind heating through this type of energy conversion pathway although contributions via other mechanisms, such as magnetic reconnection, may still be significant.

We present a flow-based generative approach to emulate grids of stellar evolutionary models. By interpreting the input parameters and output properties of these models as multidimensional probability distributions, we train conditional normalizing flows to learn and predict the complex relationships between grid inputs and outputs in the form of conditional joint distributions. Leveraging the expressive power and versatility of these flows, we showcase their ability to emulate a variety of evolutionary tracks and isochrones across a continuous range of input parameters. In addition, we describe a simple Bayesian approach for estimating stellar parameters using these flows and demonstrate its application to asteroseismic data sets of red giants observed by the Kepler mission. By applying this approach to red giants in open clusters NGC 6791 and NGC 6819, we illustrate how large age uncertainties can arise when fitting only to global asteroseismic and spectroscopic parameters without prior information on initial helium abundances and mixing length parameter values. We also conduct inference using the flow at a large scale by determining revised estimates of masses and radii for 15,388 field red giants. These estimates show improved agreement with results from existing grid-based modeling, reveal distinct population-level features in the red clump, and suggest that the masses of Kepler red giants previously determined using the corrected asteroseismic scaling relations have been overestimated by 5%–10%.

研究通过持续1.8年的Swift望远镜观测明亮、变化剧烈的活动星系核Fairall 9，发现紫外/光学波段内有很好的相关性，而X射线通量变化与紫外/光学波段的相关性较差。数据还表明，紫外/光学滞后的模式在四个时期内保持高度稳定，而X射线对紫外的滞后却不稳定，在不同时期中甚至出现了明显变化。这表明X射线对紫外的关系比通常用于AGN的简单再处理模型更为复杂。此外，文章还提出了一个“碗”模型，该模型表明灯塔照射和黑体辐射在具有陡峭边缘的盘状结构上发生，这个结构的厚度和温度与BLR的内边缘一致。 <br /><br />总结: 活动星系核的紫外/光学波段有很好的相关性，X射线通量变化则较不相关。紫外/光学滞后模式稳定，而X射线与紫外的滞后不稳定，且更为复杂。碗状模型指出辐射来源可能与BLR的内边缘有关。 <div>
We present 1.8 yr of near-daily Swift monitoring of the bright, strongly variable Type 1 active galactic nucleus (AGN) Fairall 9. Totaling 575 successful visits, this is the largest such campaign reported to date. Variations within the UV/optical are well correlated, with longer wavelengths lagging shorter wavelengths in the direction predicted by thin-disk/lamppost models. The correlations are improved by “detrending,” subtracting a second-order polynomial fit to the UV/optical light curves to remove long-term trends that are not of interest to this study. Extensive testing indicates detrending with higher-order polynomials removes too much intrinsic variability signal on reverberation timescales. These data provide the clearest detection to date of interband lags within the UV, indicating that neither emission from a large disk nor diffuse continuum emission from the broad-line region (BLR) can independently explain the full observed lag spectrum. The observed X-ray flux variations are poorly correlated with those in the UV/optical. Further, subdivision of the data into four ∼160 days light curves shows that the UV/optical lag spectrum is highly stable throughout the four periods, but the X-ray to UV lags are unstable, significantly changing magnitude and even direction from one period to the next. This indicates the X-ray to UV relationship is more complex than predicted by the simple reprocessing model often adopted for AGN. A “bowl” model (lamppost irradiation and blackbody reprocessing on a disk with a steep rim) fit suggests the disk thickens at a distance (∼10 lt-day) and temperature (∼8000 K) consistent with the inner edge of the BLR.

<div> 关键词: circumplanetary disks, giant planet formation, multifluid radiation hydrodynamics simulations, cooling time, specific angular momentum

总结:<br /><br />本文利用FARGO3D代码进行了三维全局多流体辐射流体力学模拟，阐明了在Jovian行星的广泛轨道周围形成环绕行星盘的热力学条件。研究发现，冷却时间至少比轨道时间尺度短一个数量级时，气体的比角动量在Hill半径的1/3尺度上几乎是开普勒型的。模拟结果还表明，包括多流体尘埃动力学在内的模型可以促进旋转支持，因为尘埃沉降形成一个向各向异性的辐射分布，有利于快速冷却。此外，研究发现，具有辐射流体力学的模型中，随着时间的推移，具体角动量会减小，符合由于压缩加热形成内部等熵包层的情况。因此，年轻的气态巨行星可能具有球形的等熵包层，而不是环行行星盘。 <div>
The formation of circumplanetary disks is central to our understanding of giant planet formation, influencing their growth rate during the post-runaway phase and observability while embedded in protoplanetary disks. We use three-dimensional global multifluid radiation hydrodynamics simulations with the FARGO3D code to define the thermodynamic conditions that enable circumplanetary disk formation around Jovian planets on wide orbits. Our simulations include stellar irradiation, viscous heating, static mesh refinement, and active calculation of opacity based on multifluid dust dynamics. We find a necessary condition for the formation of circumplanetary disks in terms of a mean cooling time: When the cooling time is at least 1 order of magnitude shorter than the orbital timescale, the specific angular momentum of the gas is nearly Keplerian at scales of one-third of the Hill radius. We show that the inclusion of multifluid dust dynamics favors rotational support because dust settling produces an anisotropic opacity distribution that favors rapid cooling. In all our models with radiation hydrodynamics, specific angular momentum decreases as time evolves, in agreement with the formation of an inner isentropic envelope due to compressional heating. The isentropic envelope can extend up to one-third of the Hill radius and shows negligible rotational support. Thus, our results imply that young gas giant planets may host spherical isentropic envelopes, rather than circumplanetary disks.

总结: 
本研究探讨了超大质量黑洞喷流与星系周围介质相互作用的物理过程。喷流与星系间介质的相互作用对星系内恒星形成起到了调控作用。研究建立了喷流与光滑介质相互作用模型，包括了稠密云的影响，提出了重要物理量的标度关系。首次得到了介质颗粒度的解析条件，以验证与数值模拟结果。本研究还与实际观测进行了对比，并讨论了对费米/eROSITA泡泡的影响。这项工作也为宇宙射电源在宇宙射线模拟中提出了有效的次网格模型。 <div>
Accreting supermassive black holes frequently power jets that interact with the interstellar medium (ISM)/circumgalactic medium, regulating star formation in the galaxy. Highly supersonic jets launched by active galactic nuclei (AGN) power a cocoon that confines them and shocks the ambient medium. We build on the models of narrow conical jets interacting with a smooth ambient medium, including the effect of dense clouds, which are an essential ingredient of a multiphase ISM. The key physical ingredient of this model is that the clouds along the supersonic jet beam strongly decelerate the jet head but the subsonic cocoon easily moves around the clouds without much resistance. We propose scalings for important physical quantities—cocoon pressure, head and cocoon speed, and jet radius. For the first time, we obtain the analytic condition on the ambient medium’s clumpiness for the jet to dissipate within the cocoon and verify it with numerical simulations of conical jets interacting with a uniform ISM with embedded spherical clouds. A jet is defined to be dissipated when the cocoon speed exceeds the speed of the jet head. We compare our models with more sophisticated numerical simulations and direct observations of jet–ISM interaction (e.g., quasar J1316+1753), and we discuss implications for the Fermi/eROSITA bubbles. Our work also motivates effective subgrid models for AGN jet feedback in a clumpy ISM unresolved by the present generation of cosmological galaxy formation simulations.

总结:
本文重新评估了观测中测量漫射云中H2电离率的方法，并发现灰尘消光图可以提供与先前估计不同的气体密度值。使用这些数据，结合3d-pdr代码，得出了H2丰度和CR电离率的新值，发现平均来说，CR电离率比先前估计的值低了约9倍，主要是由于密度的降低。这些结果对所有现有的电离率测量都具有深远的影响。 <div>
All current estimates of the cosmic-ray (CR) ionization rate rely on assessments of the gas density along the probed sight lines. Until now, these have been based on observations of different tracers, with C2 being the most widely used in diffuse molecular clouds for this purpose. However, dust extinction maps have recently reached sufficient accuracy to give an independent measurement of the gas density on parsec scales. In addition, they allow us to identify the gas clumps along each sight line, thus localizing the regions where CR ionization is probed. We reevaluate observations, which are often considered as the most reliable method to measure the H2 ionization rate in diffuse clouds. The peak density values derived from the extinction maps for 12 analyzed sight lines turn out to be, on average, an order of magnitude lower than the previous estimates and agree with the values obtained from revised analysis of C2 data. We use the extinction maps in combination with the 3d-pdr code to self-consistently compute the and H2 abundances in the identified clumps for different values of . For each sight line, we obtain the optimum value by comparing the simulation results with observations. We show that is systematically reduced with respect to the earlier estimates by a factor of ≈9 on average, to ≈6 × 10−17 s−1, primarily as a result of the density reduction. We emphasize that these results have profound consequences for all available measurements of the ionization rate.

新的C2与H2碰撞激发的碰撞速率系数较之前采用的数值要大得多，这对于星际气体密度的探测非常重要。作者利用这些新的速率系数模拟了46个背景源的C2旋转分布，推测出导致观测到的C2吸收的前景星际云的气体密度比之前估算的要小4-7倍，与相关视线的3D消光图中的峰值密度基本吻合。对于那些还观测到吸收并用于估算宇宙射线离子化率（CRIR）的情况，我们对CRIR的估计也会相应减小，因为丰度是CRIR与气体密度的比值的函数。 
<br /><br />总结: C2与H2碰撞激发的速率系数重新计算，推测前景星际云气体密度减小，与3D消光图吻合，估计的CRIR也减小。 <div>
Newly computed collisional rate coefficients for the excitation of C2 in collisions with H2, presented recently by Najar & Kalugina, are significantly larger than the values adopted previously in models for the excitation of the C2 molecule, a widely used probe of the interstellar gas density. With these new rate coefficients, we have modeled the C2 rotational distributions inferred from visible and ultraviolet absorption observations of electronic transitions of C2 toward a collection of 46 nearby background sources. The inferred gas densities in the foreground interstellar clouds responsible for the observed C2 absorption are a factor 4–7 smaller than those inferred previously, a direct reflection of the larger collisional rate coefficients computed by Najar & Kalugina. These lower-density estimates are generally in good agreement with the peak densities inferred from 3D extinction maps for the relevant sight lines. In cases where absorption has also been observed and used to estimate the cosmic-ray ionization rate (CRIR), our estimates of the latter will also decrease accordingly because the abundance is a function of the ratio of the CRIR to the gas density.

这篇文章报告了对超大质量黑洞（M87*为典型案例）的燃料来自椭圆星系中的湍流冷却介质的三维磁气动力学模拟。研究发现，与类比的流体动力学模拟相比，质量吸积率增加了约10倍。从大约10 pc到10^-3 pc（约10个Schwarzschild半径），质量吸积率呈现出大致的比例关系，且通过视界的吸积率约为10^-2M⊙ yr^-1。在0.03-3 kpc的尺度上，吸积流呈磁化纤维的形式。在约30 pc范围内，冷气体环绕运动形成了一个高度被磁化（β约10^-3）的厚盘，由主要是环状磁场支撑。冷盘受到截断，并在约0.3 pc（10^3个Schwarzschild半径）处转变为湍流的热吸积流。磁场驱动向极端的强流出。通过的能量通量随着吸积体积减小而增加，对于rin=8 rg，能量通量达到约3 × 10^43 erg s^-1；这相当于接近恒定的能量反馈效率η约为0.05-0.1，与吸积体积无关。反馈能量足以平衡M87 / 维尔戈热晕的总冷却，直至约50 kpc。小半径的吸积磁通量类似于磁阻滞盘模型，与M87在视界尺度上形成强大的喷流相一致。我们的结果可以为低分辨率模拟中的吸积提供次网格模型，其中相对于邦迪率，热气体吸积率受到抑制。 <br /><br />总结: 这项研究重点讨论了超大质量黑洞在燃料来源、磁场作用和能量输出等方面的模拟结果。其中包括质量吸积率的增加、磁化纤维中的吸积流、冷盘的形成和热吸积流的转变以及强大的磁场驱动的极端流出等。研究结果推动了低分辨率模拟中的吸积次网格模型的发展。 <div>
We present 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the fueling of supermassive black holes in elliptical galaxies from a turbulent cooling medium on galactic scales, taking M87* as a typical case. We find that the mass accretion rate is increased by a factor of ∼10 compared with analogous hydrodynamic simulations. The scaling of roughly holds from ∼10 pc to ∼10−3 pc (∼10 rg) with the accretion rate through the event horizon being ∼10−2M⊙ yr−1. The accretion flow on scales ∼0.03–3 kpc takes the form of magnetized filaments. Within ∼30 pc, the cold gas circularizes, forming a highly magnetized (β ∼ 10−3) thick disk supported by a primarily toroidal magnetic field. The cold disk is truncated and transitions to a turbulent hot accretion flow at ∼0.3 pc (103rg). There are strong outflows toward the poles driven by the magnetic field. The outflow energy flux increases with smaller accretor size, reaching ∼3 × 1043 erg s−1 for rin = 8 rg; this corresponds to a nearly constant energy feedback efficiency of η ∼ 0.05–0.1 independent of accretor size. The feedback energy is enough to balance the total cooling of the M87/Virgo hot halo out to ∼50 kpc. The accreted magnetic flux at small radii is similar to that in magnetically arrested disk models, consistent with the formation of a powerful jet on horizon scales in M87. Our results motivate a subgrid model for accretion in lower-resolution simulations in which the hot gas accretion rate is suppressed relative to the Bondi rate by .

We present extensive observations and analysis of supernova (SN) SN 2021dbg, utilizing optical photometry and spectroscopy. For approximately 385 days following the explosion, SN 2021dbg exhibited remarkable luminosity, surpassing most Type II SNe (SNe II). This initial high luminosity is potentially attributed to interaction between the ejected material and the surrounding circumstellar material (CSM), as evidenced by the pronounced interaction signatures observed in its spectra. The subsequent high luminosity is primarily due to the significant 56Ni mass (0.17 ± 0.05 M⊙) produced in the explosion. Based on the flux of flash emission lines detected in the initial spectra, we estimate that the CSM mass near the progenitor amounted to ∼(1.0–2.0) × 10−3M⊙, likely resulting from intense stellar wind activity 2–3 yr preceding the explosion. Considering the bolometric light curve, nebular spectrum modeling, and mass-loss rate, we suggest that the progenitor of SN 2021dbg was a red supergiant (RSG) with a mass of ∼20 M⊙ and a radius of 1200 R⊙. This RSG featured a thick hydrogen shell, which may have contained a region with a sharp decrease in material density, electron density, and temperature, contributing to its layered structure. This object demonstrates mixed features of Type IIP and IIL SNe, making it a transitional event linking the above two subclasses of SNe II.

FRB的色散度量由于与传播路径上的自由电子相互作用，成为宇宙重子分布的独特探针。利用FLIMFLAM光谱调查观测到的背景大尺度结构和干涉星系，结合观测结果，首次对IGM和CGM之间的宇宙重子分配提出了约束。该研究利用贝叶斯技术对FLIMFLAM调查的数据进行处理，推断出了由IGM气体追踪的∼Mpc尺度物质密度场的重建。同时，对干扰前景星系（在impact parameter b⊥ ≲ r200处）和FRB宿主星系进行了更深入的光谱分析，限制了来自CGM的贡献。根据我们的数据应用贝叶斯参数推断，并假设一组假设的先验知识，得出了IGM宇宙重子分数和1010M⊙ ≲ Mhalo ≲ 1013M⊙晕的CGM气体分数。在我们的样本中，平均FRB宿主星系色散度量（自然坐标系）为，其中来自宿主星系星际介质（ISM）和/或FRB发生环境。虽然我们当前的figm和fgas的不确定性范围过于宽泛，无法约束大多数星系反馈模型，但这一结果标志着IGM和CGM重子分数的首次测量，以及FRB宿主色散度量的首次系统分解：来自星系暗物质晕以及来自内部ISM/FRB引擎。 <div>
The dispersion measure of fast radio bursts (FRBs), arising from the interactions with free electrons along the propagation path, constitutes a unique probe of the cosmic baryon distribution. Their constraining power is further enhanced in combination with observations of the foreground large-scale structure and intervening galaxies. In this work, we present the first constraints on the partition of the cosmic baryons between the intergalactic medium (IGM) and circumgalactic medium (CGM), inferred from the FLIMFLAM spectroscopic survey. In its first data release, the FLIMFLAM survey targeted galaxies in the foreground of eight localized FRBs. Using Bayesian techniques, we reconstruct the underlying ∼Mpc-scale matter density field that is traced by the IGM gas. Simultaneously, deeper spectroscopy of intervening foreground galaxies (at impact parameters b⊥ ≲ r200) and the FRB host galaxies constrains the contribution from the CGM. Applying Bayesian parameter inference to our data and assuming a fiducial set of priors, we infer the IGM cosmic baryon fraction to be and a CGM gas fraction of for 1010M⊙ ≲ Mhalo ≲ 1013M⊙ halos. The mean FRB host dispersion measure (rest-frame) in our sample is , of which arises from the host galaxy interstellar medium (ISM) and/or the FRB progenitor environment. While our current figm and fgas uncertainties are too broad to constrain most galactic feedback models, this result marks the first measurement of the IGM and CGM baryon fractions, as well as the first systematic separation of the FRB host dispersion measure into two components: arising from the halo and from the inner ISM/FRB engine.

This study investigates the impact of spacecraft positioning and trajectory on in situ signatures of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Employing the 3DCORE model, a 3D flux rope model that can generate in situ profiles for any given point in space and time, we conduct forward modeling to analyze such signatures for various latitudinal and longitudinal positions, with respect to the flux rope apex, at 0.8 au. Using this approach, we explore the appearance of the resulting in situ profiles for different flux rope types, with different handedness and inclination angles, for both high- and low-twist CMEs. Our findings reveal that CMEs exhibit distinct differences in signatures between apex hits and flank encounters, with the latter displaying elongated profiles with reduced rotation. Notably, constant, nonrotating in situ signatures are only observed for flank encounters of low-twist CMEs, suggesting the existence of untwisted magnetic field lines within CME legs. Additionally, our study confirms the unambiguous appearance of different flux rope types in in situ signatures in all of the cases, barring some indistinguishable cases, contributing to the broader understanding and interpretation of observational data. Given the model assumptions, this may refute trajectory effects as the cause for mismatching flux rope types as identified in solar signatures. While acknowledging limitations inherent in our model, such as the assumption of constant twist and a nondeformable torus-like shape, we still draw relevant conclusions within the context of the global magnetic field structures of CMEs and the potential for distinguishing flux rope types based on in situ observations.

<div> AGN feedback, galaxy formation simulations, FIRE-3, cosmological zoom-in simulations, star formation

总结:
超大质量黑洞的反馈被认为是驱动观测到的星系颜色双峰性的关键因素之一。该研究使用FIRE-3宇宙学放大模拟，首次考察了AGN反馈对质量范围在10^12–10^13M⊙的星系的影响。研究发现，AGN反馈模型能够使星系符合当地的比例关系，并且产生了与观测一致的星系形态和星系星的停止形成现象。然而，当反馈参数保持恒定时，模型并不能产生一致的实际星系，表明需进一步完善AGN建模。 <div>
Feedback from supermassive black holes is believed to be a critical driver of the observed color bimodality of galaxies above the Milky Way mass scale. Active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback has been modeled in many galaxy formation simulations, but most implementations have involved simplified prescriptions or a coarse-grained interstellar medium (ISM). We present the first set of Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE)-3 cosmological zoom-in simulations with AGN feedback evolved to z ∼ 0, examining the impact of AGN feedback on a set of galaxies with halos in the mass range 1012–1013M⊙. These simulations combine detailed stellar and ISM physics with multichannel AGN feedback including radiative feedback, mechanical outflows, and, in some simulations, cosmic rays (CRs). We find that massive (>L*) galaxies in these simulations can match local scaling relations including the stellar mass–halo mass relation and the MBH–σ relation; in the stronger model with CRs, they also match the size–mass relation and the Faber–Jackson relation. Many of the massive galaxies in the simulations with AGN feedback have quenched star formation and elliptical morphologies, in qualitative agreement with observations. In contrast, simulations at the massive end without AGN feedback produce galaxies that are too massive and form stars too rapidly, are order-of-magnitude too compact, and have velocity dispersions well above Faber–Jackson. Despite these successes, the AGN models analyzed do not produce uniformly realistic galaxies when the feedback parameters are held constant: While the stronger model produces the most realistic massive galaxies, it tends to overquench the lower-mass galaxies. This indicates that further refinements of the AGN modeling are needed.

总结:<br />
本文研究了双星系统中受压缩的脉冲星磁屏对自转减速的影响。通过粒子-细胞模拟，发现压缩脉冲星在不同倾斜角度下的减速情况。在较强的约束模型中，脉冲星的自转减速会因磁场线增多而增强。而当倾斜角为90°时，压缩脉冲星的自转减速速率下降至孤立脉冲星的40%以下。最后，将分析应用于PSR J0737-3039系统，并对其磁场进行了估计。 <div>
Pulsars in binary systems with strong companion winds can have the magnetopause separating their magnetosphere from the wind located well within their light cylinder. This bow-like enclosure effectively creates a waveguide that confines the pulsar’s electromagnetic fields and can significantly alter its spindown. In this paper, we study the spindown of compressed pulsar magnetospheres in such systems. We parameterize the confinement as the ratio between the equatorial position of the magnetopause (or standoff distance) Rm and the pulsar’s light cylinder RLC. Using particle-in-cell simulations, we quantify the pulsar spindown for a range of compressions, Rm/RLC = 1/3–1, and inclination angles, χ = 0°…90°, between magnetic and rotation axes. Our strongly confined models (Rm/RLC = 1/3) show two distinct limits. For χ = 0°, the spindown of a compressed pulsar magnetosphere is enhanced by approximately a factor of three compared to an isolated pulsar due to the increased number of open magnetic field lines. Conversely, for χ = 90°, the compressed pulsar spins down at less than 40% of the rate of an isolated reference pulsar due to the mismatch between the pulsar wind stripe wavelength and the waveguide size. We apply our analysis to the 2.77 s oblique rotator (χ = 60°) in the double-pulsar system PSR J0737-3039. With the numerically derived spindown estimate, we constrain its surface magnetic field to B* ≈ (7.3 ± 0.2) × 1011 G. We discuss the time modulation of its period derivative, the effects of compression on its braking index, and implications for the radio eclipse in PSR J0737-3039.

在这篇文章中，研究了simba宇宙水动力模拟中尘埃阻碍的星形成的演化。得到了以下几点结论：在z=3之前，结果与观测结果基本一致，显示出星形成没有明显变化；然而在z>3时，发现在固定的星系恒星质量情况下，尘埃遮蔽的星形成有明显变化，与高红移观测结果存在矛盾。这种在更高红移处逐渐增加的遮蔽现象是由于星尘几何形状的演化导致的，因为灰尘与恒星质量之比在宇宙时空中保持相对恒定。此外，固定红移时，质量更大的星系有更高比例的星形成受到遮蔽，这可以通过更高的恒星质量和灰尘质量之比来解释。最后，估计了尘埃遮蔽的星形成对总体星形成率的贡献，发现尘埃遮蔽的星形成历史在z∼2−3附近达到峰值，并在z≳5时不再是主导因素。在z≲4时，尘埃遮蔽的星形成统治着星系形成的历史，这与在更高红移情况下固定星系质量的尘埃遮蔽星形成比例逐渐增加的结果一致，因为在高红移情况下存在着较少数量的大质量、高度遮蔽的星系。 <br /><br />总结: 星系在不同红移时的尘埃遮蔽星形成情况、质量更大的星系尘埃遮蔽星形成比例较高、尘埃遮蔽星形成对总体星形成率的贡献情况。 <div>
We explore the cosmic evolution of the fraction of dust-obscured star formation predicted by the simba cosmological hydrodynamic simulations featuring an on-the-fly model for dust formation, evolution, and destruction. We find that up to z = 3, our results are broadly consistent with previous observational results of little to no evolution in obscured star formation. However, at z > 3 we find strong evolution at fixed galaxy stellar mass toward greater amounts of obscured star formation, in tension with high-redshift observations. We explain the trend of increasing obscuration at higher redshifts by evolving star-dust geometry, as the dust-to-stellar mass ratios remain relatively constant across cosmic time. We additionally see that at a fixed redshift, more massive galaxies have a higher fraction of their star formation obscured, which is explained by increased dust-to-stellar mass ratios at higher stellar masses. Finally, we estimate the contribution of dust-obscured star formation to the total star formation rate budget and find that the dust-obscured star formation history peaks around z ∼ 2−3, and becomes subdominant at z ≳ 5. The dominance of obscured star formation at redshifts z ≲ 4 is consistent with our results for the evolution of the obscured star formation fraction at fixed stellar mass to higher values at higher redshift because there exist fewer massive, heavily obscured galaxies at high redshift.

这项研究发现了六个强引力透镜后蓝块星系，它们的大小小于1.3 kpc，质量密度高，具有较低的特定星形成率。这些星系的大小-质量和表面密度-质量关系与红色块星系一致，但其特定星形成率接近相同红移下紧凑星形成的蓝块系统的下限，表明它们之间存在明显的演化联系。 <div>
During the early stages of galaxy evolution, a significant fraction of galaxies undergo a transitional phase between the “blue nugget” systems, which arise from the compaction of large, active star-forming disks, and the “red nuggets,” which are red and passive compact galaxies. These objects are typically only observable with space telescopes, and detailed studies of their size, mass, and stellar population parameters have been conducted on relatively small samples. Strong gravitational lensing can offer a new opportunity to study them in detail, even with ground-based observations. In this study, we present the first six bona fide samples of strongly lensed post-blue nugget (pBN) galaxies, which were discovered in the Kilo Degree Survey. By using the lensing-magnified luminosity from optical and near-infrared bands, we have derived robust structural and stellar population properties of the multiple images of the background sources. The pBN galaxies have very small sizes of Reff < 1.3 kpc, high mass density inside 1 kpc of , and low specific star formation rates of , The size–mass and Σ1–mass relations of this sample are consistent with those of the red nuggets, while their sSFR is close to the lower end of compact star-forming blue nugget systems at the same redshift, suggesting a clear evolutionary link between them.

总结: 研究发现，M87星系中的经典新星主要集中在星系的喷流附近，而且这种分布概率性极低。这些新星在喷流附近的特征与远离喷流的新星没有区别。研究探讨了新星分布的可能解释，但发现目前的解释都无法完全解释喷流附近新星的增加。因此，M87星系喷流附近新星的增加现象尚未得到合理解释。 <div>
The 135 classical novae that we have discovered in M87 with two Hubble Space Telescope imaging surveys appear to be strongly concentrated along that galaxy’s jet. Detailed simulations show that the likelihood that this distribution occurred by chance is of order 0.3%. The novae near the jet display outburst characteristics (peak luminosities, colors, and decline rates) that are indistinguishable from novae far from the jet. We explore whether the remarkable nova distribution could be caused by the jet’s irradiation of the hydrogen-rich donors in M87's cataclysmic binaries. This explanation, and others extant in the literature that rely on increased binary mass transfer rates, fail by orders of magnitude in explaining the enhanced nova rate near the jet. An alternate explanation is the presence of a genuine surplus of nova binary systems near the jet, perhaps due to jet-induced star formation. This explanation fails to explain the lack of nova enhancement along M87's counterjet. The enhanced rate of novae along M87's jet is now firmly established, and unexplained.

总结:
该研究通过LIGO和Virgo探测器在第三次观测运行（O3）期间，提出了一种对偏心黑洞合并敏感的波形独立搜索方法。结果显示未发现新的高显著性候选事件。研究确定了搜索对高质量（总源框架质量M>70 M⊙）的偏心二进制系统的灵敏度，并将模型预测与搜索结果进行比较。基于预设的人口模型，假设所有探测结果都是准圆的，该研究在90%置信水平下对具有偏心度0< e ≤ 0.3的高质量二进制系统的合并率密度放置了保守上限为16.9 Gpc−3 yr−1。<br /><br /> <div>
Despite the growing number of binary black hole coalescences confidently observed through gravitational waves so far, the astrophysical origin of these binaries remains uncertain. Orbital eccentricity is one of the clearest tracers of binary formation channels. Identifying binary eccentricity, however, remains challenging due to the limited availability of gravitational waveforms that include the effects of eccentricity. Here, we present observational results for a waveform-independent search sensitive to eccentric black hole coalescences, covering the third observing run (O3) of the LIGO and Virgo detectors. We identified no new high-significance candidates beyond those that have already been identified with searches focusing on quasi-circular binaries. We determine the sensitivity of our search to high-mass (total source-frame mass M > 70 M⊙) binaries covering eccentricities up to 0.3 at 15 Hz emitted gravitational-wave frequency, and use this to compare model predictions to search results. Assuming all detections are indeed quasi-circular, for our fiducial population model, we place a conservative upper limit for the merger rate density of high-mass binaries with eccentricities 0 < e ≤ 0.3 at 16.9 Gpc−3 yr−1 at the 90% confidence level.

<div> 星球系统，潮汐质量因子，角动量，系统演化，NGTS-10

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章提出了一种新的方法，通过观察非同步星球系统来限制潮汐质量因子。文章基于动力系统理论，指出了星球系统角动量共同演化轨迹在Ωorb-Ωspin平面存在一个禁区，该禁区主要由潮汐相互作用的强度决定。通过比较单个星球系统的(Ωorb, Ωspin)与禁区，可以确定潮汐质量因子，无需考虑系统的演化历史。应用该方法于NGTS-10-NGTS-10 b系统，得到的潮汐质量因子为，从而得到了潮汐力的严格上限。由于这不能被之前的理论预测解释，表明非同步星球系统中存在抑制潮汐作用的机制。 <div>
We propose a novel method to constrain the tidal quality factor, , from an observed nonsynchronized star–planet system consisting of a slowly rotating low-mass star and a close-in Jovian planet, taking into account the coevolution of stellar spin and planetary orbit due to the tidal interaction and the magnetic braking. On the basis of dynamical system theory, the track of the coevolution of angular momentum from the fast-rotator regime for such a system exhibits the existence of a forbidden region in the Ωorb–Ωspin plane, where Ωspin and Ωorb denote the angular velocity of the stellar spin and planetary orbit, respectively. The forbidden region is determined primarily by the strength of the tidal interaction. By comparing the (Ωorb, Ωspin) of a single star–planet system to the forbidden region, we can constrain the tidal quality factor regardless of the evolutionary history of the system. The application of this method to the star–planet system NGTS-10–NGTS-10 b gives , leading to a tight upper bound on the tidal torque. Since this cannot be explained by previous theoretical predictions for nonsynchronized star–planet systems, our result requires mechanisms that suppress the tidal interaction in such systems.

We surveyed nearly all the embedded protostars in seven nearby clouds (Corona Australis, Aquila, Chamaeleon I and II, Ophiuchus North, Ophiuchus, Serpens) with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at 1.3 mm observations with a resolution of 0.″1. This survey detected 184 protostellar disks, 90 of which were observed at a resolution of 14–18 au, making it one of the most comprehensive high-resolution disk samples across various protostellar evolutionary stages to date. Our key findings include the detection of new annular substructures in two Class I and two flat-spectrum sources, while 21 embedded protostars exhibit distinct asymmetries or substructures in their disks. We find that protostellar disks have a substantially large variability in their radii across all evolutionary classes. In particular, the fraction of large disks with sizes above 60 au decreases as the protostar evolves from Class 0 to Class I. Compiling the literature data, we discovered an increasing trend of the gas disk radii to dust disk radii ratio (Rgas,Kep/Rmm) with increasing bolometric temperature (Tbol). Our results indicate that the dust and gas disk radii decouple during the early Class I stage. However, in the Class 0 stage, the dust and gas disk sizes are similar, which allows for a direct comparison between models and observational data at the earliest stages of protostellar evolution. We show that the distribution of radii in the 52 Class 0 disks in our sample is in high tension with various disk formation models, indicating that protostellar disk formation remains an unsolved question.

We present an overview and first results from the Spectroscopic Ultradeep Survey Probing Extragalactic Near-infrared Stellar Emission (SUSPENSE), executed with NIRSpec on JWST. The primary goal of the SUSPENSE program is to characterize the stellar, chemical, and kinematic properties of massive quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon. In a single deep NIRSpec/MSA configuration, we target 20 distant quiescent galaxy candidates (z = 1–3, HAB ≤ 23), as well as 53 star-forming galaxies at z = 1–4. With 16 hr of integration and the G140M-F100LP dispersion-filter combination, we observe numerous Balmer and metal absorption lines for all quiescent candidates. We derive stellar masses (logM*/M⊙ ∼ 10.2–11.5) and detailed star formation histories (SFHs) and show that all 20 candidate quiescent galaxies indeed have quenched stellar populations. These galaxies show a variety of mass-weighted ages (0.8–3.3 Gyr) and star formation timescales (∼0.5–4 Gyr), and four out of 20 galaxies were already quiescent by z = 3. On average, the z > 1.75 [z < 1.75] galaxies formed 50% of their stellar mass before z = 4 [z = 3]. Furthermore, the typical SFHs of the galaxies in these two redshift bins (zmean = 2.2 [1.3]) indicate that galaxies at higher redshift formed earlier and over shorter star formation timescales compared to lower redshifts. Although this evolution is naturally explained by the growth of the quiescent galaxy population over cosmic time, number density calculations imply that mergers and/or late-time star formation also contribute to the evolution. In future work, we will further unravel the early formation, quenching, and late-time evolution of these galaxies by extending this work with studies on their chemical abundances, resolved stellar populations, and kinematics.

We present the discovery of 2MASS J05241392−0336543 (hereafter J0524−0336), a very metal-poor ([Fe/H] = −2.43 ± 0.16), highly r-process-enhanced ([Eu/Fe] = +1.34 ± 0.10) Milky Way halo field red giant star, with an ultrahigh Li abundance of A(Li, 3D, NLTE) = 6.15 ± 0.25 and [Li/Fe] = +7.64 ± 0.25, respectively. This makes J0524−0336 the most lithium-enhanced giant star discovered to date. We present a detailed analysis of the star’s atmospheric stellar parameters and chemical abundance determinations. Additionally, we detect indications of infrared excess, as well as observe variable emission in the wings of the Hα absorption line across multiple epochs, indicative of a potential enhanced mass-loss event with possible outflows. Our analysis reveals that J0524−0336 lies either between the bump and the tip of the red giant branch (RGB), or on the early asymptotic giant branch (e-AGB). We investigate the possible sources of lithium enrichment in J0524−0336, including both internal and external sources. Based on current models and on the observational evidence we have collected, our study shows that J0524−0336 may be undergoing the so-called lithium flash that is expected to occur in low-mass stars when they reach the RGB bump and/or the e-AGB.

预警系统开发和操作：KamLAND和SK已联合开展前超新星中微子监测研究，并开发了联合预警系统，能够提供超新星警报给天体物理学界。

联合监测能力：联合系统可以以最高1世纪1次误报率的显著水平检测到距离地球510 pc的一颗15太阳质量的恒星的前超新星中微子信号。

提前警示功能：对于类似Betelgeuse的模型，可以提前最多12小时发出警报。 

<br /><br />总结: 
KamLAND和SK在日本的Kamioka矿联合开展前超新星中微子监测，并且开发了联合预警系统，能够检测到来自距离地球510 pc的15太阳质量恒星的前超新星中微子信号，提供高显著水平的警报，并且可以提前最多12小时发出警报。 <div>
Preceding a core-collapse supernova (CCSN), various processes produce an increasing amount of neutrinos of all flavors characterized by mounting energies from the interior of massive stars. Among them, the electron antineutrinos are potentially detectable by terrestrial neutrino experiments such as KamLAND and Super-Kamiokande (SK) via inverse beta decay interactions. Once these pre-supernova (pre-SN) neutrinos are observed, an early warning of the upcoming CCSN can be provided. In light of this, KamLAND and SK, both located in the Kamioka mine in Japan, have been monitoring pre-SN neutrinos since 2015 and 2021, respectively. Recently, we performed a joint study between KamLAND and SK on pre-SN neutrino detection. A pre-SN alert system combining the KamLAND detector and the SK detector was developed and put into operation, which can provide a supernova alert to the astrophysics community. Fully leveraging the complementary properties of these two detectors, the combined alert is expected to resolve a pre-SN neutrino signal from a 15 M⊙ star within 510 pc of the Earth at a significance level corresponding to a false alarm rate of no more than 1 per century. For a Betelgeuse-like model with optimistic parameters, it can provide early warnings up to 12 hr in advance.

总结：<br /><br />2023年1月，利用JWST的MIRI中分辨率光谱仪对β Pic周围的典型碎片盘进行了观测。与Spitzer上的红外光谱观测相比，发现了明显的差异。在5-15μm范围内建模的明亮连续谱已经消失，以约600K的黑体模型。之前显著的18和23μm结晶辉石发射特征也消失了，被来自更热的500K尘埃成分的非常微弱的特征所取代。此外，10μm硅酸盐特征的形状发生了变化，与温暖尘埃成分的温度从约300K升至约500K以及温暖的硅酸盐尘埃的结晶分数增加一致。这些结果表明β Pic系统具有动态的星周环境，增强的碰撞可能导致大量尘埃在行星系统中形成大云团。20年间，恒星辐射压可能已经将Spitzer光谱中观测到的热和冷结晶尘埃粒子吹出行星系统。 <div>
Modeling observations of the archetypal debris disk around β Pic, obtained in 2023 January with the MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrograph on board JWST, reveals significant differences compared with that obtained with the Infrared Spectrograph on board Spitzer. The bright 5–15 μm continuum excess modeled using a ∼600 K black body has disappeared. The previously prominent 18 and 23 μm crystalline forsterite emission features, arising from cold dust (∼100 K) in the Rayleigh limit, have disappeared and been replaced by very weak features arising from the hotter 500 K dust population. Finally, the shape of the 10 μm silicate feature has changed, consistent with a shift in the temperature of the warm dust population from ∼300 to ∼500 K and an increase in the crystalline fraction of the warm, silicate dust. Stellar radiation pressure may have blown both the hot and the cold crystalline dust particles observed in the Spitzer spectra out of the planetary system during the intervening 20 yr between the Spitzer and JWST observations. These results indicate that the β Pic system has a dynamic circumstellar environment, and that periods of enhanced collisions can create large clouds of dust that sweep through the planetary system.

We test the influence of spiral arms on the star formation activity of disk galaxies by constructing and fitting multiwavelength spectral energy distributions for the two nearby spiral galaxies NGC 628 and NGC 4321, at a spatial scale of 1–1.5 kpc. Recent results in the literature support the “gatherers” picture, i.e., that spiral arms gather material but do not trigger star formation. However, ambiguities in the diagnostics used to measure star formation rates (SFRs) and other quantities have hampered attempts at reaching definite conclusions. We approach this problem by utilizing the physical parameters output of the Multi-wavelength Analysis of Galaxy Physical Properties fitting code, which we apply to the ultraviolet-to-far infrared photometry, in ≥20 bands, of spatially resolved regions in the two galaxies. We separate the regions into arm and interarm, and study the distributions of the specific SFRs (sSFR = SFR/Mstar), stellar ages, and star formation efficiencies (SFE = SFR/Mgas). We find that the distributions of these parameters in the arm regions are almost indistinguishable from those in the interarm regions, with typical differences of a factor of 2 or less in the medians. These results support the “gatherer” scenario of spiral arms, which we plan to test with a larger sample in the near future.

<br />
利用Edenhofer等人的太阳邻域高分辨率3D尘埃地图，我们得出了Local Bubble尘埃迹象表面的新的3D模型。我们发现Local Bubble表面形状高度不规则，其最大消光面距太阳平均距离为170 pc（跨越70–600+ pc），典型厚度为35 pc，总尘埃迹象质量为（6.0 ± 0.7）×105M⊙。Local Bubble在银河北半球具有延伸，形态上与“本地烟囱”一致。我们认为，这个烟囱可能是由超新星驱动的超泡爆发所造成，导致了星际介质喷发进入更低的银河暗区。我们发现许多著名的尘埃特征和分子云位于Local Bubble表面，可能存在多个通向星际介质相邻腔的通道。我们的Local Bubble的新的秒差距分辨率视图可用于未来分析附近气体和年轻恒星的演化，调查太阳周边与银河的下层暗区之间的直接联系，以及其他众多应用。

Leveraging a high-resolution 3D dust map of the solar neighborhood from Edenhofer et al., we derive a new 3D model for the dust-traced surface of the Local Bubble, the supernova-driven cavity surrounding the Sun. We find that the surface of the Local Bubble is highly irregular in shape, with its peak extinction surface falling at an average distance of 170 pc from the Sun (spanning 70–600+ pc) with a typical thickness of 35 pc and a total dust-traced mass of (6.0 ± 0.7) × 105M⊙. The Local Bubble displays an extension in the Galactic northern hemisphere that is morphologically consistent with representing a “local chimney.” We argue this chimney was likely created by the “bursting” of this supernova-driven superbubble, leading to the funneling of interstellar medium (ISM) ejecta into the lower Galactic halo. We find that many well-known dust features and molecular clouds fall on the surface of the Local Bubble and that several tunnels to other adjacent cavities in the ISM may be present. Our new, parsec-resolution view of the Local Bubble may be used to inform future analysis of the evolution of nearby gas and young stars, the investigation of direct links between the solar neighborhood and the Milky Way’s lower halo, and numerous other applications.

总结: 
本文研究了2017年2月发生在OJ 287上的多波段活动，发现其在软X射线和极高能γ射线波段都经历了复杂的闪耀行为。研究聚焦于活动前、中、后三个状态，发现至少有两个非热辐射区域参与了这次闪耀事件，其中一个更紧凑的区域导致了观测到的耀斑。宽带建模结果和对2017年OJ 287射电喷流中的一个新射电节的观察与一次源自射电核外强再压缩激波的闪耀事件是一致的。 <div>
In 2017 February, the blazar OJ 287 underwent a period of intense multiwavelength activity. It reached a new historic peak in the soft X-ray (0.3–10 keV) band, as measured by the Swift X-ray Telescope. This event coincides with a very-high-energy (VHE) γ-ray outburst that led VERITAS to detect emission above 100 GeV, with a detection significance of 10σ (from 2016 December 9 to 2017 March 31). The time-averaged VHE γ-ray spectrum was consistent with a soft power law (Γ = −3.81 ± 0.26) and an integral flux corresponding to ∼2.4% that of the Crab Nebula above the same energy. Contemporaneous data from multiple instruments across the electromagnetic spectrum reveal a complex flaring behavior, primarily in the soft X-ray and VHE bands. To investigate the possible origin of such an event, our study focuses on three distinct activity states: before, during, and after the 2017 February peak. The spectral energy distributions during these periods suggest the presence of at least two nonthermal emission zones, with the more compact one responsible for the observed flare. Broadband modeling results and observations of a new radio knot in the jet of OJ 287 in 2017 are consistent with a flare originating from a strong recollimation shock outside the radio core.

Jansky Very Large Array观测了九个近邻（z≲0.055）矮星系中非核心持续性射电源（PRS），并对其中一个进行了1.7 GHz的高分辨率欧洲VLBI网络观测。研究比较了这些PRS的物理特性（如尺寸、频谱能量分布、射电亮度和光变曲线）与已知活动星系核（AGN）相关的PRS，发现J1136+2643是最有希望与快速射电暴（FRB）源相关的PRS。此外，还针对J1136+2643进行了中子星风星云和超星云模型的验证，发现其物理尺寸、亮度和SED与这些模型基本一致。最后，讨论了这些射电源可能由不断吸积的超大质量黑洞所驱动的替代解释，并概述了区分这些场景的未来展望和跟进观测。 <div>
We present 1–12 GHz Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations of nine off-nuclear persistent radio sources (PRSs) in nearby (z ≲ 0.055) dwarf galaxies, along with high-resolution European VLBI Network observations for one of them at 1.7 GHz. We explore the plausibility that these PRSs are associated with fast radio burst (FRB) sources by examining their properties—physical sizes, host-normalized offsets, spectral energy distributions (SEDs), radio luminosities, and light curves—and compare them to those of the PRSs associated with FRB 20121102A and FRB 20190520B, two known active galactic nuclei (AGN), and one likely AGN in our sample with comparable data, as well as other radio transients exhibiting characteristics analogous to FRB-PRSs. We identify a single source in our sample, J1136+2643, as the most promising FRB-PRS, based on its compact physical size and host-normalized offset. We further identify two sources, J0019+1507 and J0909+5655, with physical sizes comparable to FRB-PRSs, but which exhibit large offsets and flat spectral indices potentially indicative of a background AGN origin. We test the viability of neutron star wind nebula and hypernebula models for J1136+2643 and find that the physical size, luminosity, and SED of J1136+2643 are broadly consistent with these models. Finally, we discuss the alternative interpretation that the radio sources are instead powered by accreting massive black holes, and we outline future prospects and follow-up observations for differentiating between these scenarios.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了2008年1月期间的太阳活动最低期，跟踪了来自STEREO/EUVI的次级流干扰（PD）在扩展的日冕中的传播过程，并通过非径向路径在STEREO/COR1和STEREO/COR2中追踪其结构。通过对417个独特的OPD进行分析，发现了两类PD：慢速OPD和快速OPD。慢速OPD更倾向于在大约1.6R⊙处形成，速度大约为每秒1.5R⊙，并且在7.5R⊙时加速。快速OPD主要在1.6R⊙和3.0R⊙处形成，并且速度也在7.5R⊙时。IPD在大约1.8R⊙处形成，速度约为每秒数十千米，主要集中在日冕物质抛射爆发后。最后，文章还展示了与OPD相关的周期性亮度变化，在2.0R⊙范围内持续存在，速度与通过行星际闪烁获得的太阳风速度相吻合。 <div>
We revisit a quiet 14 day period of solar minimum during 2008 January and track substreamer propagating disturbances (PDs) from low heights in STEREO/EUVI to the extended corona through STEREO/COR1 and into STEREO/COR2 along nonradial paths that trace the structure of the underlying streamers. Using our recently developed method for generating nonradial height–time profiles of outward PDs (OPDs) and inward PDs (IPDs), we obtained their velocities along the radial and position angle directions. Our analysis of 417 unique OPDs revealed two classes: slow and fast OPDs. Slow OPDs form preferentially at ≈1.6 R⊙ closer to the streamer boundaries, with asymmetric occurrence rates, and show speeds of at 1.5 R⊙ and accelerate up to at 7.5 R⊙. Fast OPDs form preferentially at ≈1.6 R⊙ and at ≈3.0 R⊙ both at the streamer boundaries and slightly more often within them. They show speeds of at 1.5 R⊙ up to at 7.5 R⊙. IPDs are observed forming at ≈1.8 R⊙ with speeds of tens of kilometers per second, mostly concentrated in the aftermath of a coronal mass ejection eruption. We present an example in which we show that periodic brightness variations related to OPDs remained in the range of 98 to 128 minutes, down to ≈2.0 R⊙, well within the field of view of COR1. The velocity profiles of slow OPDs for a heliocentric height below 3.0 R⊙ show good agreement with speeds more closely related to the bulk solar wind obtained via interplanetary scintillation.

总结: 针对使用MaNGA数据从不同角度研究了棒状强度和运动学如何影响星系中的星形成。通过Galaxy Zoo DESI对棒状进行分类，以及使用MaNGA调查的星动力学数据上使用Tremaine–Weinberg方法对其进行分类。研究发现，在星形成星系中强棒状结构会导致中心和棒状末端区域的星形成增强，而在棒状臂部分却会导致星形成受到抑制。相反，对于弱棒状星系，其星形成的径向分布与无棒状星系非常相似。此外，研究还发现，在星形成星系中，缓慢的棒状结构会导致沿着棒状的星形成显著增加，然而全局的星形成率在有快速和缓慢棒状结构的星系中并没有显著差异。这表明棒状结构的动力学不会全局影响星形成，而是改变了星系中的星形成位置。因此，研究发现如果棒状结构既强又缓慢，它将对其主星系产生最大影响。 <br /><br /> <div>
We study how bar strength and bar kinematics affect star formation in different regions of the bar by creating radial profiles of EW[Hα] and Dn4000 using data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey-IV Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA). Bars in galaxies are classified as strong or weak using Galaxy Zoo DESI, and they are classified as fast and slow bars using the Tremaine–Weinberg method on stellar kinematic data from the MaNGA survey. In agreement with previous studies, we find that strong bars in star-forming (SF) galaxies have enhanced star formation in their center and beyond the bar-end region, while star formation is suppressed in the arms of the bar. This is not found for weakly barred galaxies, which have very similar radial profiles to unbarred galaxies. In addition, we find that slow bars in SF galaxies have significantly higher star formation along the bar than fast bars. However, the global star formation rate is not significantly different between galaxies with fast and slow bars. This suggests that the kinematics of the bar do not affect star formation globally, but changes where star formation occurs in the galaxy. Thus, we find that a bar will influence its host the most if it is both strong and slow.

总结: 一项关于银河恒星系统中伽马射线发射的研究偶然发现了一个名为IRC-10412的冷却和演化恒星，其强烈的无线电发射级别引起了人们的关注。随后的观测分析表明，IRC-10412被归类为半规则变星SRb型，处于渐近巨星分支。研究提出了其质量流失参数的不同但一致的估计值。研究人员认为其异常高的无线电发射可能源自于受到外部光子电离源的影响，可能来自附近的OB星团。<br /><br /> <div>
As a byproduct of our search for Galactic stellar systems with gamma-ray emission, we have identified an unrelated cool and evolved star (IRC-10412) that attracted our attention due to its strong radio emission level with a spectral index matching, almost perfectly, the canonical +0.6 value expected from an ionized stellar wind. A follow-up observational analysis was undertaken given that these two properties are hard to reconcile as originating in the same stellar object. As a result, IRC-10412 has been classified as a new semiregular variable of SRb type in the asymptotic giant branch, and different but consistent estimates of its mass-loss parameter are reported. We propose that its unusually high radio emission arises from a ∼10−5M⊙ yr−1 stellar wind exposed to an external source of ionizing photons, possibly coming from nearby OB associations.

总结:
本文利用Swift观测GRB的数据，发现GRB 210514A具有大约11秒的QPO信号，信号的置信水平超过3σ。该GRB的全局光变曲线呈现双平台结构，在平台间有明显的衰减段。作者提出了一个超质量磁星模型来解释这一现象，其中第一个平台的QPO信号是由经历进动运动的超质量磁星的偶极辐射产生的，急剧衰减是因为超质量磁星坍缩成黑洞，第二个平台可能是由新生黑洞的回落吸积产生的。作者利用贝叶斯统计学对进动模型进行了拟合，并讨论了最佳拟合磁星参数。其他关于黑洞中心引擎的替代模型也可以解释这次爆发，但在这种情况下，QPO信号可能仅仅是巧合。 <br /><br /> <div>
Magnetar is proposed as one of the possible central engines for a gamma-ray burst (GRB). Recent studies show that if a magnetar has a rotational axis misaligned from the magnetic one, a periodic lightcurve pattern is expected with a period of seconds to minutes. Inspired by this unique feature, in this paper, we search for the quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) signals in the Swift observations of GRBs. Using the Lomb–Scargle periodogram and the weighted wavelet Z-transform algorithms, we find that the Swift Burst Alert Telescope data of GRB 210514A has a QPO signal with a period ∼11 s. The estimated confidence level of the signal is over 3σ. The global lightcurve of this GRB exhibits a double-plateau structure with a sharp decay segment between plateaus. The lightcurve feature resembles those of GRBs that were reported to have internal plateaus. We explain the observations of GRB 210514A with a supramassive magnetar (SMM) model, where the QPO signal in the first plateau is produced via the dipole radiation of the SMM experiencing a precession motion, the sharp decay is due to the collapse of the SMM into a black hole (BH), and the second plateau could be produced via the fallback accretion of the newborn BH. We fit the precession model to the observations using the Bayesian statistic and the best-fit magnetar parameters are discussed. Alternative models concerning a BH central engine may also provide reasonable explanations for this burst, only in this case the QPO signal could merely be a coincidence.

红外脉冲星PSR J1622-0315是已知紧凑红背毫秒脉冲星中的一员，其伴星表现出极低的辐射，尽管轨道周期很短。研究者使用2017年新技术望远镜和2022年北欧光学望远镜的光学观测数据，结合ICARUS二进制建模代码进行模拟，确定了该系统的二进制参数。他们发现，该红外脉冲星的最佳拟合中子星质量为2.3 ± 0.4 M⊙，伴星质量为0.15 ± 0.02 M⊙。研究还首次探测到了来自最小值的不对称低水平辐射以及其光曲线在五年内最大值的不对称性变化。通过恒星黑斑模型，研究者发现与对称直接加热模型相比，能够更好地拟合观测数据，并且得到了一致的轨道参数。最后，他们讨论了一个替代场景，即变化的不对称性是由可变的星际冲击产生的。综上所述，研究者发现PSR J1622-0315将低辐射与可变的光曲线不对称性以及相对较高的中子星质量相结合。 <div>
The companion to PSR J1622-0315, one of the most compact known redback millisecond pulsars, shows extremely low irradiation despite its short orbital period. We model this system to determine the binary parameters, combining optical observations from the New Technology Telescope in 2017 and the Nordic Optical Telescope in 2022 with the binary modeling code ICARUS. We find a best-fit neutron star mass of 2.3 ± 0.4 M⊙, and a companion mass of 0.15 ± 0.02 M⊙. We detect for the first time low-level irradiation from asymmetry in the minima as well as a change in the asymmetry of the maxima of its light curves over five years. Using starspot models, we find better fits than those from symmetric direct heating models, with consistent orbital parameters. We discuss an alternative scenario where the changing asymmetry is produced by a variable intrabinary shock. In summary, we find that PSR J1622-0315 combines low irradiation with variable light-curve asymmetry and a relatively high neutron star mass.

<div> Poynting-flux-dominated jet, magnetic field, turbulence, polarization degree, X-ray
<br /><br />总结:
在Poynting-flux-dominated jet中，经过磁重联和能量耗散后，有序磁场逐渐转变为湍流和磁场无序。通过引入一个包括随机磁场和有序磁场的简化模型，发现随机磁场对低能X射线的极化度结果有显著影响。随着电子注入停止，有序磁场下X射线段的极化度仍有显著值，更易于通过偏振测量检测。然而，引入随机磁场后，低能段和高能段的极化度呈现类似趋势，且X射线段的极化度低于高能段。此外，会出现两种未曾出现的偏振角旋转，并且高能段的旋转略早于之前。这些结果与有序磁场的结构无关。 <div>
In a Poynting-flux-dominated jet that exhibits an ordered magnetic field, a transition toward turbulence and magnetic disorder follows after magnetic reconnection and energy dissipation during the prompt emission phase. In this process, the configuration of the magnetic field evolves with time, rendering it impossible to entirely categorize the magnetic field as ordered. Therefore, we assumed a crude model that incorporates a random magnetic field and an ordered magnetic field, and takes into account the proportionality of the random magnetic field strength to the ordered magnetic field, in order to compute the polarization degree (PD) curve for an individual pulse. It has been discovered that the random magnetic field has a significant impact on the PD results of the low-energy X-ray. In an ordered magnetic field, the X-ray segment maintains a significant PD compared to those in the hundreds of keV and MeV ranges even after electron injection ceases, making PD easier to detect by polarimetry. However, when the random magnetic field is introduced, the low-energy and high-energy PDs exhibit a similar trend, with the X-ray PD being lower than that of the high-energy segment. Of course, this is related to the rate of disorder in the magnetic field. Additionally, there are two rotations of the polarization angles (PAs) that were not present previously, and the rotation of the PA in the high-energy segment occurs slightly earlier. These results are unrelated to the structure of the ordered magnetic field.

<div> T Tauri Stars, Exoplanets, Spectroscopic Survey, Near-infrared, Spot Variability
<br /><br />总结:
这项研究通过分析T Tauri Stars（TTSs）的近红外H波段光谱，使用来自Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer的光谱，探索了13颗T Tauri Stars（TTSs）的斑点变异性。通过分析原子Fe i在∼1.56259 μm和∼1.56362 μm处以及分子OH在∼1.56310和∼1.56317 μm处的有效温度（Teff）敏感线的等效宽度比（EWR）关系，我们建立了Teff在3400–5000 K范围内的经验EWR关系，从而实现了精确的Teff相对估计，达到几十K的范围，并表明与太阳金属丰度目标模型兼容。然而，观测数据与模型预测之间的差异限制了Teff–EWR关系向更广泛参数空间的推广。我们的研究揭示了经典和弱线TTSs可以表现出超过2年内超过150 K的Teff变化。在TTSs中检测到EWR和径向速度相位曲线之间的四分之一相位延迟表明受斑点驱动的信号。然而，CI Tau的相位延迟为0.06 ± 0.13，这表明额外的动力学，可能是由行星相互作用引起的，推测出旋转周期和轨道周期之间的1：1共振。此外，Teff变化幅度与恒星倾角之间的正相关性支持TTSs上存在高纬度斑点的存在，进一步丰富了我们对年轻恒星表面活动的理解。 <div>
As part of the Young Exoplanets Spectroscopic Survey, this study explores the spot variability of 13 T Tauri Stars (TTSs) in the near-infrared H band, using spectra from the Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer. By analyzing effective temperature (Teff) sensitive lines of atomic Fe i at ∼1.56259 μm and ∼1.56362 μm, and molecular OH at ∼1.56310 and ∼1.56317 μm, we develop an empirical equivalent width ratio (EWR) relationship for Teff in the range of 3400–5000 K. This relationship allows for precise relative Teff estimates to within tens of Kelvin and demonstrates compatibility with solar metallicity target models. However, discrepancies between observational data and model predictions limit the extension of the Teff–EWR relationship to a broader parameter space. Our study reveals that both classical and weak-line TTSs can exhibit Teff variations exceeding 150 K over a span of 2 yr. The detection of a quarter-phase delay between the EWR and radial velocity phase curves in TTSs indicates spot-driven signals. A phase delay of 0.06 ± 0.13 for CI Tau, however, suggests additional dynamics, potentially caused by planetary interaction, inferred from a posited 1:1 commensurability between the rotation period and orbital period. Moreover, a positive correlation between Teff variation amplitude and stellar inclination angle supports the existence of high-latitude spots on TTSs, further enriching our understanding of stellar surface activity in young stars.

<div> 关键词: 快速射电暴发, 强磁体星, 脉冲能量分布, 中子星磁层, 引力自透镜效应

总结:
快速射电暴发（FRBs）是宇宙中短暂的相干射电发射，其来源尚不明确。目前，银河系磁星SGR 1935 + 2154是唯一已知发射类似FRBs的天体物体，这支持了FRBs可能源自磁星的假设。然而，FRBs的许多性质，如重复发生和一次性源之间的二分法，以及它们的功率能量分布等，仍不够理解。本文假设FRBs起源于锚定在中子星磁层中的共转热点，并且偶尔通过中子星引力自透镜效应得到大幅度放大。我们评估了这种放大的概率，并表明：（i）事件的能量分布通常遵循E−(2−3)的幂律；（ii）所有FRB源可以看作是重复发生的，其一次性源或重复发生的外观取决于放大概率对发射几何和源相对地球的定向的关键依赖；（iii）最活跃的重复发生者对应于极其罕见和精密调整的定向（约1/106），导致放大概率大，从而使它们的暴发经常可检测。同时，它们的能量释放似乎增强，通常大于10倍，缓解了它们的能量预算问题。 <br /><br /> <div>
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are cosmological subsecond bursts of coherent radio emission, whose source is still unknown. To date, the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935 + 2154 is the only astrophysical object known to emit radio bursts akin to FRBs, albeit less powerful, supporting suggestions that FRBs originate from magnetars. Many remarkable properties of FRBs—e.g., the dichotomy between repeaters and one-off sources, and their power-law energy distributions (with typical index ∼2–3)—are not well understood yet. Moreover, the huge radio power released by the most active repeaters is challenging even for the magnetic energy reservoir of magnetars. Here, we assume that FRBs originate from corotating hotspots anchored in neutron star (NS) magnetospheres and occasionally get amplified by large factors via gravitational self-lensing in the strong NS field. We evaluate the probability of amplification and show that: (i) a power-law energy distribution of events ∝E−(2−3) is generally expected; (ii) all FRB sources may be regarded as repeating, their appearance as one-off sources or repeaters being determined by the critical dependence of the amplification probability on the emission geometry and source orientation relative to Earth; and (iii) the most active repeaters, in particular, correspond to extremely rare and finely tuned orientations (∼1 in 106), leading to large probabilities of amplification that make their bursts frequently detectable. At the same time, their power release appears enhanced, typically by factors ≳10, easing their energy budget problem.

The scale of α-element yields is difficult to predict from theory because of uncertainties in massive star evolution, supernova physics, and black hole formation, and it is difficult to constrain empirically because the impact of higher yields can be compensated by greater metal loss in galactic winds. We use a recent measurement of the mean iron yield of core collapse supernovae (CCSN) by Rodriguez et al., , to infer the scale of α-element yields by assuming that the plateau of [α/Fe] abundance ratios observed in low-metallicity stars represents the yield ratio of CCSN. For a plateau at [α/Fe]cc = 0.45, we find that the population-averaged yields of O and Mg are about equal to the solar abundance of these elements, , where is the mass of element X produced by massive stars per unit mass of star formation. The inferred O and Fe yields agree with predictions of the Sukhbold et al. CCSN models assuming their Z9.6+N20 neutrino-driven engine, a scenario in which many progenitors with M < 40M⊙ implode to black holes rather than exploding. The yields are lower than assumed in many models of the galaxy mass–metallicity relation, reducing the level of outflows needed to match observed abundances. Our one-zone chemical evolution models with evolve to solar metallicity at late times. By further requiring that models reach [α/Fe] ≈ 0 at late times, we infer a Hubble-time integrated Type Ia supernova rate of , compatible with estimates from supernova surveys.

<br /><br />总结:
这篇文章讨论了活动星系核（AGN）可能是IceCube探测到的高能宇宙中微子的主要来源，并提出了AGN中宇宙中微子的产生机制尚未建立的问题。研究通过对AGN的15 GHz无线电观测数据和IceCube的10年中微子数据进行相关性分析，并采用了时间相关的方法来提高统计功效。研究发现在两种分析中均未发现明显的相关性，并报告了上限。与IceCube的漫射通量相比，对于能量为100 TeV，谱指数为2.5的情况，得到的上限分别约为3%和9%。 <div>
Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are prime candidate sources of the high-energy, astrophysical neutrinos detected by IceCube. This is demonstrated by the real-time multimessenger detection of the blazar TXS 0506+056 and the recent evidence of neutrino emission from NGC 1068 from a separate time-averaged study. However, the production mechanism of the astrophysical neutrinos in AGN is not well established, which can be resolved via correlation studies with photon observations. For neutrinos produced due to photohadronic interactions in AGN, in addition to a correlation of neutrinos with high-energy photons, there would also be a correlation of neutrinos with photons emitted at radio wavelengths. In this work, we perform an in-depth stacking study of the correlation between 15 GHz radio observations of AGN reported in the MOJAVE XV catalog, and 10 yr of neutrino data from IceCube. We also use a time-dependent approach, which improves the statistical power of the stacking analysis. No significant correlation was found for both analyses, and upper limits are reported. When compared to the IceCube diffuse flux, at 100 TeV and for a spectral index of 2.5, the upper limits derived are ∼3% and ∼9% for the time-averaged and time-dependent cases, respectively.

Very Large Telescope/UVES spectroscopic and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometric observations for WASP 0346-21 allow the direct determination of its physical properties, along with the detection of a circumbinary object and oscillating signals. The high-resolution spectra yielded the radial velocities of all three stars and the atmospheric parameters of Teff,A = 7225 ± 42 K, [M/H] = 0.30 ± 0.03 dex, and vA = 78 ± 5 km s−1 of the primary component. The combined analysis of these observations resulted in the fundamental parameters of the eclipsing components and the third light of l3 = 0.043 ± 0.004, which is consistent with the light contribution of the tertiary star observed in the echelle spectra. WASP 0346-21 A resides within the overlapping main-sequence domain of δ Sct and γ Dor variables, while the secondary component of MB = 0.185 ± 0.013 M⊙, RB = 0.308 ± 0.023 R⊙, Teff,B = 10,655 ± 146 K, and LB = 1.09 ± 0.17 L⊙ matches well with the low-mass white dwarf (WD) model for Z = 0.01, corresponding to the thick disk population classified by the Galactic kinematics. Multifrequency analyses were performed on the residual TESS data after removing the binarity effects. The low frequencies around 26.348 day−1 and 17.683 day−1 are δ Sct pulsations originating from WASP 0346-21 A, and the high frequencies of 97.996 day−1 and 90.460 day−1 are considered to be extremely low-mass WD oscillations. These results demonstrate that WASP 0346-21 is a hierarchical triple system, consisting of an EL CVn binary with multiperiodic pulsations in each component and a distant outer tertiary.

We present a rapid and reliable deep-learning-based method for gravitational-wave (GW) signal reconstruction from elusive, generic binary black hole mergers in LIGO data. We demonstrate that our model, AWaRe, effectively recovers GWs with parameters it has not encountered during training. This includes features like higher black hole masses, additional harmonics, eccentricity, and varied waveform systematics, which introduce complex modulations in the waveform’s amplitudes and phases. The accurate reconstructions of these unseen signal characteristics demonstrate AWaRe's ability to handle complex features in the waveforms. By directly incorporating waveform reconstruction uncertainty estimation into the AWaRe framework, we show that for real GW events, the uncertainties in AWaRe's reconstructions align closely with those achieved by benchmark algorithms like BayesWave and coherent WaveBurst. The robustness of our model to real GW events and its ability to extrapolate to unseen data open new avenues for investigations in various aspects of GW astrophysics and data analysis, including tests of general relativity and the enhancement of current GW search methodologies.

We present an investigation of evolved stars in the nearby star-forming galaxy Wolf–Lundmark–Melotte (WLM), using Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) imaging from the JWST Resolved Stellar Populations Early Release Science program. We find that various combinations of the F090W, F150W, F250M, and F430M filters can effectively isolate red supergiants and thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stars from one another, while also providing a reasonable separation of the primary TP-AGB subtypes: carbon-rich C-type stars and oxygen-rich M-type stars. The classification scheme we present here agrees very well with the well-established Hubble Space Telescope (HST) medium-band filter technique. The ratio of C to M-type stars is 0.8 ± 0.1 for both the new JWST and the HST classifications, which is within 1σ of empirical predictions from optical narrowband CN and TiO filters. The evolved star colors show good agreement with the predictions from the PARSEC + COLIBRI stellar evolutionary models, and the models indicate a strong metallicity dependence that makes stellar identification even more effective at higher metallicity. However, the models also indicate that evolved star identification with NIRCam may be more difficult at lower metallicities. We test every combination of NIRCam filters using the models and present additional filters that are also useful for evolved star studies. We also find that ≈90% of the dusty evolved stars are carbon rich, suggesting that carbonaceous dust dominates the present-day dust production in WLM, similar to the findings in the Magellanic Clouds. These results demonstrate the usefulness of NIRCam in identifying and classifying dust-producing stars without the need for mid-infrared data.

Brown dwarfs (BDs) are model degenerate in age and mass. High-contrast imaging and spectroscopy of BD companions to host stars where the mass and age can be independently constrained by dynamics and stellar age indicators, respectively, provide valuable tests of BD evolution models. In this paper, we present a new epoch of Subaru/CHARIS H- and K-band observations of one such previously discovered system, HD 33632 Ab. We reanalyze the mass and orbit using our new epoch of extracted relative astrometry and fit extracted spectra to the newest generation of equilibrium, disequilibrium, and cloudy spectral and evolution models for BDs. No spectral model perfectly agrees with evolutionary tracks and the derived mass and age, instead favoring a somewhat younger BD than the host star’s inferred age. This tension can potentially be resolved using atmosphere and evolution models that consider both clouds and disequilibrium chemistry simultaneously or by additional future spectra at higher resolution or in other band passes. Photometric measurements alone remain consistent with the luminosity predicted by evolutionary tracks. Our work highlights the importance of considering complexities like clouds, disequilibrium chemistry, and composition when comparing spectral models to evolutionary tracks.

The interpretation of gamma-ray emission originating from the solar disk (0.5° in angular size) as due to the interaction of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) with the solar atmosphere has remained a central challenge in solar physics. After the seminal work by Seckel, Stanev, and Gaisser based on GCRs’ magnetic mirroring, discrepancies between models and observations persist, indicating the need for a novel approach. The present work focuses on exploring the impact of a closed magnetic field geometry in the low photosphere on the observed gamma-ray flux. We track numerically with the PLUTO code the trajectories of test-particle protons within a static ∼20 Mm scale height magnetic arcade adjacent to jets. By making use of numerical vertical density profiles, we inject particles at distinct chromospheric/photospheric altitudes, mimicking the migration of GCRs from neighboring flux tubes into closed arcades. Remarkably, our model reproduces a flat gamma-ray spectrum below ∼33 GeV, a nearly isotropic emission at ∼10 GeV, both consistent with Fermi-LAT observations, and a near-limb emission at ∼1 TeV. Our model can also reproduce the flux-drop detected by HAWC (∼1 TeV). Finally, we argue that the spectral dip observed at ∼40 GeV may result from the flux suppression at low energy due to the cross-field diffusion, which would produce a cutoff. These findings underscore the pivotal role of closed magnetic field structures in shaping the solar disk gamma-ray emission.

<div> photometric, spectroscopic, Type Ia supernova, SN 2023wrk, carbon-rich

总结:
photometric 和 spectroscopic 观测显示了距离约 40 Mpc 的附近 Type Ia 超新星 SN 2023wrk。观测到超新星爆发后几小时内的早期检测，光变曲线在最初几天显示出一个颠簸特征，而 B − V 颜色呈蓝色并保持几乎恒定。光谱演化整体上与 SN 1991T/SN 1999aa 型 SN Ia 类似，而在最大光度后 t ≈ -15.4 天拍摄的第一张光谱中 C iiλ6580 吸收线显得异常强烈。这种碳特征在随后的演化中迅速消失，但在光度峰值左右再次出现。碳线的复杂演化以及最早光谱中可能检测到的4700 Å 和5300 Å周围的 Ni iii 吸收表明燃料和残余物质的宏观混合。强烈的碳线可能与 SN 释放物与无捆绑碳的碰撞有关，这与脉动延迟爆炸或碳富周围星际物质相互作用模型的预测一致。在这些最初时期具有强烈 C iiλ6580 吸收线的碳富 SNe Ia 中，C ii 和 Si ii 的线强比以及 B − V 颜色的演化显示出较大的多样性，这可能归因于不同性质的无捆绑碳和外向混合的 56Ni。 <div>
We present extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of the nearby Type Ia supernova (SN) 2023wrk at a distance of about 40 Mpc. The earliest detection of this SN can be traced back to a few hours after the explosion. Within the first few days, the light curve shows a bump feature, while the B − V color is blue and remains nearly constant. The overall spectral evolution is similar to that of an SN 1991T/SN 1999aa-like SN Ia, while the C iiλ6580 absorption line appears to be unusually strong in the first spectrum taken at t ≈ −15.4 days after the maximum light. This carbon feature disappears quickly in subsequent evolution but it reappears at around the time of peak brightness. The complex evolution of the carbon line and the possible detection of Ni iii absorption around 4700 Å and 5300 Å in the earliest spectra indicate macroscopic mixing of fuel and ash. The strong carbon lines are likely related to the collision of SN ejecta with unbound carbon, consistent with the predictions of pulsational delayed-detonation or carbon-rich circumstellar-matter interaction models. Among those carbon-rich SNe Ia with strong C iiλ6580 absorption at very early times, the line-strength ratio of C ii to Si ii and the B − V color evolution are found to exhibit large diversity, which may be attributed to different properties of unbound carbon and outward-mixing 56Ni.

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey-IV/Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) Survey data provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the internal motions of galaxies and, in particular, represent the largest sample of barred galaxy kinematic maps obtained to date. We present results from Nirvana, our nonaxisymmetric kinematic modeling code built with a physically motivated Bayesian forward modeling approach, which decomposes MaNGA velocity fields into first- and second-order radial and tangential rotational modes in a generalized and minimally supervised fashion. We use Nirvana to produce models and rotation curves for 1263 unique barred MaNGA galaxies and a matched unbarred control sample. We present our modeling approach, tests of its efficacy, and validation against existing visual bar classifications. Nirvana finds elevated noncircular motions in galaxies identified as bars in imaging, and bar position angles that agree well with visual measurements. The Nirvana-MaNGA barred and control samples provide a new opportunity for studying the influence of nonaxisymmetric internal disk kinematics in a large statistical sample.

<div> 高红移、流动速度、星团形成、模拟、星系形成
<br />
在高红移（z ≳ 12）时，流动速度在低质量天体中明显影响星团形成，减少低质量气体天体的丰度，同时促进了超声速诱导的气体天体（SIGO）和其中的星团在暗物质暗流外的形成。研究了在带有和不带流动速度的一组模拟中，流动对星团在暗物质暗流及SIGO内的形成的群体级影响。结果显示，流动实际上增强了所有质量的单个暗流内的星团形成，在z = 12和z = 20之间。这表现为每个天体的增加的星团形成率，以及Kennicutt–Schmidt关系在有流动天体中的增强。模拟结果与一些高红移观测一致，但在群体级别上，相对于大部分观测，仍然低估了星团形成。模拟结果没有包括反馈，因此可以视为星团形成率的上限，加剧了这些差异。然而，超密度区域的模拟（有和无流动速度）与观测一致，为未来观测中提取关于超密度和流动速度信息的策略提供了参考。 
<br /><br />总结:在高红移时，流动速度显著影响星团的形成，尤其是减少了低质量气体天体的丰度。模拟结果显示流动实际上会增强暗流内星团的形成率，并且Kennicutt–Schmidt关系也会得到加强。然而，模拟结果在群体级别上仍然低估了星团形成率，这可能是由于模拟未考虑反馈效应所致。对于超密度区域的模拟结果与观测一致，为未来观测提取超密度和流动速度信息提供了策略。 <div>
At high redshifts (z ≳ 12), the relative velocity between baryons and dark matter (the so-called streaming velocity) significantly affects star formation in low-mass objects. Streaming substantially reduces the abundance of low-mass gas objects while simultaneously allowing for the formation of supersonically induced gas objects (SIGOs) and their associated star clusters outside of dark matter halos. Here, we present a study of the population-level effects of streaming on star formation within both halos and SIGOs in a set of simulations with and without streaming. Notably, we find that streaming actually enhances star formation within individual halos of all masses at redshifts between z = 12 and z = 20. This is demonstrated both as an increased star formation rate per object as well as an enhancement of the Kennicutt–Schmidt relation for objects with streaming. We find that our simulations are consistent with some observations at high redshift, but on a population level, they continue to underpredict star formation relative to the majority of observations. Notably, our simulations do not include feedback and so can be taken as an upper limit on the star formation rate, exacerbating these differences. However, simulations of overdense regions (both with and without streaming) agree with observations, suggesting a strategy for extracting information about the overdensity and streaming velocity in a given survey volume in future observations.

The central regions of the Milky Way constitute a unique laboratory for a wide swath of astrophysical studies; consequently, the inner ∼400 pc have been the target of numerous large surveys at all accessible wavelengths. In this paper, we present a catalog of sources at 25 and 37 μm located within all of the regions observed with the SOFIA/FORCAST instrument in the inner ∼200 pc of the Galaxy. The majority of the observations were obtained as part of the SOFIA Cycle 7 Galactic Center Legacy program survey, which was designed to complement the Spitzer/MIPS 24 μm catalog in regions saturated in the MIPS observations. Due to the wide variety of source types captured by our observations at 25 and 37 μm, we do not limit the FORCAST source catalog to unresolved point sources, or treat all sources as if they are pointlike sources. The catalog includes all detectable sources in the regions, resulting in a catalog of 950 sources, including point sources, compact sources, and extended sources. We also provide the user with metrics to discriminate between the source types.

<div> 高红移星系、Lyman连续发射、模型、脱逸量、星系性质
总结:<br /><br />本研究利用Cox比例风险模型进行生存分析，开发了新的经验多元预测模型，用于预测Lyman连续发射的脱逸量。通过应用这些模型到高红移星系，发现了预测的脱逸量范围，并鉴定出几个可能的极端泄漏星系。研究还发现多元预测与单变量预测有显著不同，以及高红移星系的预测脱逸量可能会因使用星形率表面密度或半径作为星系形态测量而有显著差异。研究提供了使用这些模型预测高红移星系的所有必要参数。 <div>
JWST is uncovering the properties of ever-increasing numbers of galaxies at z > 6, during the epoch of reionization. Connecting these observed populations to the process of reionization requires understanding how efficiently they produce Lyman continuum (LyC) photons and what fraction (fesc) of these photons escape into the intergalactic medium. By applying the Cox proportional hazards model, a survival analysis technique, to the Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS), we develop new, empirical, multivariate predictions for fesc. The models developed from the LzLCS reproduce the observed fesc for z ∼ 3 samples, which suggests that LyC emitters may share similar properties at low and high redshift. Our best-performing models for the z ∼ 3 galaxies include information about dust attenuation, ionization, and/or morphology. We then apply these models to z ≳ 6 galaxies. For large photometric samples, we find a median predicted fesc = 0.047–0.14. For smaller spectroscopic samples, which may include stronger emission-line galaxies, we find that ≥33% of the galaxies have fesc > 0.2, and we identify several candidate extreme leakers with fesc ≥ 0.5. The current samples show no strong trend between predicted fesc and UV magnitude, but limited spectroscopic information makes this result uncertain. Multivariate predictions can give significantly different results from single-variable predictions, and the predicted fesc for high-redshift galaxies can differ significantly depending on whether star formation rate surface density or radius is used as a measure of galaxy morphology. We provide all parameters necessary to predict fesc for additional samples of high-redshift galaxies using these models.

<div> 关键词: 太阳耀斑, 监督机器学习, 特征分类, 非线性核, 分类准确度<br />
总结:<br />
本文介绍了一种使用监督机器学习来分类太阳耀斑的标准化程序。研究使用来自RHESSI任务的耀斑数据和来自HARPS-N仪器的太阳光谱进行训练，并发现表现最好的算法是具有非线性核（特别是径向基函数RBF）的C-支持向量分类（SVC）。最佳训练模型SVC与RBF核的平均综合准确度得分为0.65，对于无耀斑和弱耀斑类别的分类准确度得分分别超过0.70。测试表明该模型能够在不同特征和分布的全新数据中检测和分类太阳耀斑。未来的努力可以集中在提高分类准确度，探索替代模型的有效性（特别是深度学习模型），并加入更多数据集，以扩展该框架在宿主系外行星的恒星上的应用。 <div>
Flares are a well-studied aspect of the Sun’s magnetic activity. Detecting and classifying solar flares can inform the analysis of contamination caused by stellar flares in exoplanet transmission spectra. In this paper, we present a standardized procedure to classify solar flares with the aid of supervised machine learning. Using flare data from the RHESSI mission and solar spectra from the HARPS-N instrument, we trained several supervised machine-learning models, and found that the best-performing algorithm is C-Support Vector Classification (SVC) with nonlinear kernels, specifically radial basis functions (RBF). The best-trained model, SVC with RBF kernels, achieves an average aggregate accuracy score of 0.65, and categorical accuracy scores of over 0.70 for the no-flare and weak-flare classes, respectively. In comparison, a blind classification algorithm would have an accuracy score of 0.33. Testing showed that the model is able to detect and classify solar flares in entirely new data with different characteristics and distributions from those of the training set. Future efforts could focus on enhancing classification accuracy, investigating the efficacy of alternative models, particularly deep learning models, and incorporating more data sets to extend the application of this framework to stars that host exoplanets.

<div> 关键词：磁流体力学、离心盘、磁旋不稳定性、垂直重力、MHD湍流

总结：<br /><br />本研究探讨了垂直重力对离心磁旋不稳定性所激发的磁流体力学湍流的影响。与无垂直重力的离心盘类似，Maxwell应力与压力之比保持在10^-2左右，而Maxwell应力中的局部反转也持续存在。垂直重力引入了两种新效应：近近心点区域的垂直压缩加剧了重连和耗散，削弱了磁场。磁流体力学应力对角动量传输加速了密度分布的广度，在大约5到10轨道内使质量和离心率的空间分布发生了显著改变。离心碎片中的MHD应力可能在撕裂事件后1年以上的时间里产生辐射。 <div>
Previously we demonstrated that the magnetorotational instability (MRI) grows vigorously in eccentric disks, much as it does in circular disks, and we investigated the nonlinear development of the eccentric MRI without vertical gravity. Here we explore how vertical gravity influences the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence stirred by the eccentric MRI. Similar to eccentric disks without vertical gravity, the ratio of Maxwell stress to pressure, or the Shakura–Sunyaev α parameter, remains ∼10−2, and the local sign flip in the Maxwell stress persists. Vertical gravity also introduces two new effects. Strong vertical compression near pericenter amplifies reconnection and dissipation, weakening the magnetic field. Angular momentum transport by MHD stresses broadens the mass distribution over eccentricity at much faster rates than without vertical gravity; as a result, spatial distributions of mass and eccentricity can be substantially modified in just ∼5 to 10 orbits. MHD stresses in the eccentric debris of tidal disruption events may power emission ≳1 yr after disruption.

<br />总结: 本研究推导了一个半解析的稳定性条件，适用于具有任意倾角的两星系统，其中内部行星是一个测试粒子。研究使用微扰理论计算了外伴对内部二进制的半长轴的特征分数变化β = δa1/a1，由此可以得出稳定性条件。研究发现，环形轨道下，逆行轨道一般比顺行轨道更稳定；中间相互倾角的系统由于von Ziepel–Lidov–Kozai (vZLK)动力学而不太稳定；平均运动共振可以通过抑制vZLK渐进过程来稳定相互倾角渐进不稳定的区域；共振可以破坏一些动力学稳定区域。这些稳定性条件还可用于约束观测系统的轨道特性和它们的年龄。 <div>
Multiple analytical, semi-analytical, and empirical stability criteria have been derived in the literature for two-planet systems. But, the dependence of the stability limit on the initial mutual inclination between the inner and outer orbits is not well modeled by previous stability criteria. Here, we derive a semi-analytical stability criteria for two-planet systems, at arbitrary inclinations, in which the inner planet is a test particle. Using perturbation theory we calculate the characteristic fractional change in the semimajor axis of the inner binary β = δa1/a1 caused by perturbations from the companion. Stability criteria can be derived by setting a threshold on β. Focusing initially on circular orbits, we derive an analytical expression for β for coplanar prograde and retrograde orbits. For noncoplanar configurations, we evaluate a semi-analytical expression. We then generalize to orbits with arbitrary eccentricities and account for the secular effects. Our analytical and semi-analytical results are in excellent agreement with direct N-body simulations. In addition, we show that contours of β ∼ 0.01 can serve as criteria for stability. More specifically, we show that (1) retrograde orbits are generally more stable than prograde ones; (2) systems with intermediate mutual inclination are less stable due to von Ziepel–Lidov–Kozai (vZLK) dynamics; and (3) mean motion resonances (MMRs) can stabilize intermediate inclination secularly unstable regions in phase space, by quenching vZLK secular processes (4) MMRs can destabilize some of the dynamically stable regions. We also point out that these stability criteria can be used to constrain the orbital properties of observed systems and their age.

<br /><br />总结:
这篇文章利用詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜获取了23个晚型T和Y矮星的红外光谱能量分布。它包括NIRSpec PRISM和MIRI低分辨率光谱仪在λ/Δλ≈100处覆盖了1-12μm波长范围的光谱和15、18和21μm的宽带光度测量。它展示了这些对象常见的吸收特征，包括H2O、CH4、CO、CO2和NH3。文章中还计算出了冷棕矮星的首次准确的辐射通量，并通过Spitzer和哈勃空间望远镜的视差获得了这些冷矮星的首次准确辐射通量。同时使用Sonora Bobcat太阳金属丰度演化模型估计了矮星的半径，得出了有效温度估计，范围从∼1000到350K，中位误差为±20K，几乎比以前的工作提高了一个数量级。文章还讨论了光谱的各个部分在按有效温度排序时是不是都清晰地呈现出一个序列。 <div>
We present infrared spectral energy distributions of 23 late-type T and Y dwarfs obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope. The spectral energy distributions consist of NIRSpec PRISM and MIRI low-resolution spectrometer spectra covering the ∼1–12 μm wavelength range at λ/Δλ ≈ 100 and broadband photometry at 15, 18, and 21 μm. The spectra exhibit absorption features common to these objects including H2O, CH4, CO, CO2, and NH3. Interestingly, while the spectral morphology changes relatively smoothly with spectral type at λ < 3 μm and λ > 8 μm, it shows no clear trend in the 5 μm region where a large fraction of the flux emerges. The broad-wavelength coverage of the data enables us to compute the first accurate measurements of the bolometric fluxes of cool brown dwarfs. Combining these bolometric fluxes with parallaxes from Spitzer and Hubble Space Telescope, we also obtain the first accurate bolometric luminosities of these cool dwarfs. We then used the Sonora Bobcat solar-metallicity evolutionary models to estimate the radii of the dwarfs, which results in effective temperature estimates ranging from ∼1000 to 350 K with a median uncertainty of ± 20 K, which is nearly an order of magnitude improvement over previous work. We also discuss how various portions of the spectra either do or do not exhibit a clear sequence when ordered by their effective temperatures.

总结:<br />
本研究通过对250颗Gaia Data Release 3超冷矮星（UCDs）进行TESS光变曲线（LCs）的搜索，发现了61颗具有明显周期性和单一行为的旋转标志。另外，还发现了5颗具有双峰特征的UCDs，以及20颗LCs显示出复杂行为。通过颜色-星等图的分布，发现了两个不同的UCD旋转分布模式，表明旋转速度和年龄有关。这一研究结果为未来的研究提供了重要参考，但是样本分隔引起的物理趋势还需要进一步验证。 <div>
This study presents the results of a search for rotation signatures in 250 Gaia Data Release 3 ultra-cool dwarfs (UCDs) with TESS light curves (LCs). We identified 71 targets with unambiguous periodicities, of which 61 present rotation signatures and a single-source behavior, with periods between 0.133 and 5.81 days. Five UCDs show double-dip features, namely variations with two periods, one approximately double or half the other. The remaining 10 UCDs with unambiguous variability present a likely nonsingle behavior. We also found 20 UCDs showing complex behavior in their LCs, with noticeable fluctuations and irregular structure, with a few exhibiting apparent changes in their temporal structure. The remaining 159 targets show noisy LCs corresponding to low-amplitude signals, whose temporal variation cannot be easily identified. The distribution of the UCDs with rotation signature in a color–magnitude diagram points to a lack of rotating objects within about 11.5 < MG < 12.5 and G–GRP < 1.5, separating them into two regimes, one mainly composed of less massive late-M stars with Prot ≥ 1.0 day, and another mainly composed of more massive early-M stars with Prot < 1.0 day. It is important to emphasize that by separating stars into age intervals, one observes that UCDs with Prot ≥ 1.0 day tend to be located in regions of younger objects, and, in contrast, those with Prot < 1.0 day are mainly concentrated in regions of older objects. Whether this trend of stars contrasting the sample separation is physical or produced by observational biases is a question to be verified in future studies.

总结: 
本研究对Kepler超新星遗迹中的电子加速现象进行了分析。研究表明，在遗迹的北部壳层，电子加速受到周围尘埃密集介质的影响而得到提升。通过对X射线辐射的观测和分析，发现在大多数的细丝结构中，电子加速效率受到了复杂的影响，但在一个特定区域中，电子加速时间超出了同步辐射的时间，导致了非热X射线辐射的明显减弱。这些发现为我们提供了对Kepler超新星遗迹中电子加速现象的深入理解。 <div>
The maximum energy of electrons in supernova remnant (SNR) shocks is typically limited by radiative losses, where the synchrotron cooling time equals the acceleration time. The low speed of shocks in a dense medium increases the acceleration time, leading to lower maximum electron energies and fainter X-ray emissions. However, in Kepler’s SNR, an enhanced electron acceleration, which proceeds close to the Bohm limit, occurs in the north of its shell, where the shock is slowed by a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). To investigate whether this scenario still holds at smaller scales, we analyzed the temporal evolution of the X-ray synchrotron flux in filamentary structures using the two deepest Chandra/ACIS X-ray observations, performed in 2006 and 2014. We examined spectra from different filaments, measured their proper motion, and calculated the acceleration to synchrotron timescale ratios. The interaction with the turbulent and dense northern CSM induces competing effects on electron acceleration: on one hand, turbulence reduces the electron mean free path enhancing the acceleration efficiency, and on the other hand, lower shock velocities increase the acceleration timescale. In most filaments, these effects compensate each other, but in one region, the acceleration timescale exceeds the synchrotron timescale, resulting in a significant decrease in nonthermal X-ray emission from 2006 to 2014, indicating fading synchrotron emission. Our findings provide a coherent understanding of the different regimes of electron acceleration observed in Kepler’s SNR through various diagnostics.

Ne viii traces the volume-filling, virial-temperature gas in ∼1012M☉ halos. In ∼1013M☉ halos the Ne viii gas is clumpier, and biased toward the cooler part of the warm-hot phase. We compare the simulations to observations from the COS Absorption Survey of Baryon Harbors (or CASBaH) and COS Ultraviolet Baryon Survey (or CUBS). We show that when inferring halo masses from stellar masses to compare simulated and observed halos, it is important to account for the scatter in the stellar-mass–halo-mass relation, especially at M⋆ ≳ 1010.5M☉. Median Ne viii columns in the fiducial FIRE-2 model are about as high as observed upper limits allow, while the simulations analyzed do not reproduce the highest observed columns. This suggests that the median Ne viii profiles predicted by the simulations are consistent with observations, but that the simulations may underpredict the scatter. We find similar agreement with analytical models that assume a product of the halo gas fraction and metallicity (relative to solar) ∼0.1, indicating that observations are consistent with plausible circumgalactic medium temperatures, metallicities, and gas masses. Variants of the FIRE simulations with a modified supernova feedback model and/or active galactic nuclei feedback included (as well as some other cosmological simulations from the literature) more systematically underpredict Ne viii columns. The circumgalactic Ne viii observations therefore provide valuable constraints on simulations that otherwise predict realistic galaxy properties.

总结:
本研究利用Chandra X-ray Observatory对四个大质量、明亮、动态活跃的星系团（A3667、A2319、A520和A2146）的X射线表面亮度进行了详细的三维热力学结构研究。利用前向建模方法，研究人员发现A3667和A2319的ICM跨越边缘的三维热力学结构与冷锋的特征一致，而A520和A2146则与激波锋的性质相一致。此外，在A520和A2146的激波锋中，ICM的温度显示出在激波锋位置最高的特点。在A520中观察到的ICM温度表明，在激波锋后的区域内，在距离激波锋大约300kpc的范围内，ICM温度呈现出约10keV的等温特性，与激波加热的瞬时均衡模型的假设相一致。<br /><br /> <div>
We present a detailed study of three-dimensional (3D) thermodynamic structures of the intracluster medium (ICM) across edges in the X-ray surface brightness of four massive, bright, dynamically active galaxy clusters (A3667, A2319, A520, and A2146), with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Based on a forward modeling approach developed in previous work, we extend this approach with more generalized ICM density and temperature profiles, allowing us to apply uniformly to the observed X-ray surface brightness profiles to detect edges and measure the 3D thermodynamic profiles of the ICM simultaneously and self-consistently. With the forward modeling analysis, we find, in agreement with previous works, that the obtained 3D thermodynamic structures of the ICM across the edges in A3667 and A2319 are consistent with the characteristics of cold fronts, whereas those in A520 and A2146 are consistent with the nature of shock fronts. We find that the azimuthal distribution of the pressure ratio at the cold front in A3667 shows a different trend from that in A2319. For the shock fronts in A520 and A2146, the observed 3D temperature profiles of the ICM indicate that the temperature is highest at the position of the shock front. In the case of the sector exhibiting in A520, the ICM temperature appears isothermal with a temperature of ∼10 keV until ∼300 kpc away from the shock front in the post-shock region, being consistent with the hypothesis of the instant-equilibration model for shock heating.

本研究使用澳大利亚平方公里阵列中径阵列观测到的射电数据进行了一个系统性的潮汐撕裂事件（TDEs）的搜索。该研究选取了12个射电明亮的候选TDEs，它们的时间尺度和亮度范围分别为约6至230天和约1038到1041 erg s−1，与TDEs产生的相对论射流的射电辐射模型一致。通过蒙特卡罗模拟TDEs的检测效率，并假设所有12个源都是具有喷流的TDEs，我们计算得到了具有喷流的TDEs的体积率为Gpc−3 yr−1，这与先前经验估计的速率一致。
<br />总结: 本研究利用VAST射电调查系统性地搜索了TDEs，并鉴定了12个射电明亮的候选TDEs，其射电辐射特征与TDEs的模型一致。通过检测效率模拟和假设，推断得到了具有喷流的TDEs的体积率，这对之前的估计速率具有一致性。 <div>
We present a systematic search for tidal disruption events (TDEs) using radio data from the Variables and Slow Transients (VAST) Pilot Survey conducted using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder. Historically, TDEs have been identified using observations at X-ray, optical, and ultraviolet wavelengths. After discovery, a few dozen TDEs have been shown to have radio counterparts through follow-up observations. With systematic time-domain radio surveys becoming available, we can now identify new TDEs in the radio regime. A population of radio-discovered TDEs has the potential to provide several key insights including an independent constraint on their volumetric rate. We conducted a search to select variable radio sources with a single prominent radio flare and a position consistent within 2σ of the nucleus of a known galaxy. While TDEs were the primary target of our search, sources identified in this search may also be consistent with active galactic nuclei exhibiting unusual flux density changes at the timescales probed, uncharacteristically bright supernovae, or a population of gamma-ray bursts. We identify a sample of 12 radio-bright candidate TDEs. The timescales and luminosities range from ∼6 to 230 days and ∼1038 to 1041 erg s−1, respectively, consistent with models of radio emission from TDEs that launch relativistic jets. After calculating the detection efficiency of our search using a Monte Carlo simulation of TDEs, and assuming all 12 sources are jetted TDEs, we derive a volumetric rate for jetted TDEs of Gpc−3 yr−1, consistent with previous empirically estimated rates.

The excess broadening of high-temperature spectral lines, long observed near the tops of flare arcades, is widely considered to result from magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. According to different theories, plasma turbulence is also believed to be a candidate mechanism for particle acceleration during solar flares. However, the degree to which this broadening is connected to the acceleration of nonthermal electrons remains largely unexplored outside of recent work, and many observations have been limited by limited spatial resolution and cadence. Using the Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer, we present spatially resolved observations of loop-top (LT) broadenings using hot (≈11 MK) Fe xxi 1354.1 Å line emission at ≈9 s cadence during the 2022 March 30 X1.3 flare. We find nonthermal velocities upward of 65 km s−1 that decay linearly with time, indicating the presence and subsequent dissipation of plasma turbulence. Moreover, the initial Fe xxi signal was found to be cospatial and cotemporal with microwave emission measured by the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array, placing a population of nonthermal electrons in the same region as the LT turbulence. Evidence of electron acceleration at this time is further supported by hard X-ray measurements from the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays on board Solar Orbiter. Using the decay of nonthermal broadenings as a proxy for turbulent dissipation, we found the rate of energy dissipation to be consistent with the power of nonthermal electrons deposited into the chromosphere, suggesting a possible connection between turbulence and electron acceleration.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了JWST和MIRI在研究早期宇宙中星系时的应用。使用NIRSpec和MIRI得到了MACS0647-JD星系的观测结果，并首次直接测量了其金属丰度。该星系的金属丰度与z∼4-9的星系类似，但高于预期。此外，还对星系的电离参数、电离光子产生效率和恒星形成速率进行了进一步的限制，展示了JWST NIRSpec和MIRI联合研究早期星系的强大能力。 <div>
JWST spectroscopy has revolutionized our understanding of galaxies in the early Universe. Covering wavelengths up to 5.3 μm, NIRSpec can detect rest-frame optical Hα emission lines out to z = 7 and [O iii] to z = 9.5. Observing these lines in more distant galaxies requires longer wavelength spectroscopy with MIRI. Here we present MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrograph integral field unit observations of the lensed galaxy merger MACS0647–JD at z = 10.165. With exposure times of 4.2 hr in each of two bands (SHORT and LONG), we detect Hα at 9σ, [O iii] λ5008 at 11σ, and [O iii] λ4960 at 3σ. Combined with previously reported NIRSpec spectroscopy that yielded seven emission lines including the auroral line [O iii] λ4363, we present the first direct metallicity measurement of a z > 10 galaxy: , or . This is similar to galaxies at z ∼ 4–9 with direct metallicity measurements, though higher than expected given the high specific star formation rate log(sSFR/yr−1) = −7.4 ± 0.3. We further constrain the ionization parameter = −1.9 ± 0.1, ionizing photon production efficiency log(ξion) = 25.3 ± 0.1, and SFR = 5.0 ± 0.6 M⊙ yr−1 within the past 10 Myr. These observations demonstrate the combined power of JWST NIRSpec and MIRI for studying galaxies in the first 500 million years.

Magnification serves as an independent and complementary gravitational lensing measurement to shear. We develop a novel method to achieve an accurate and robust magnification measurement around BOSS CMASS galaxies across physical scales of 0.016h−1 Mpc < rp < 10h−1 Mpc. We first measure the excess total flux density δM of the source galaxies in the deep DECaLS photometric catalog that are lensed by CMASS galaxies. We convert δM to magnification μ by establishing the δμ–δM relation using a deeper photometric sample. By comparing magnification measurements in three optical bands (grz), we constrain the dust attenuation curve and its radial distribution, discovering a steep attenuation curve in the circumgalactic medium of CMASS galaxies. We further compare dust-corrected magnification measurements to model predictions from high-resolution dark matter-only (DMO) simulations in Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and Planck cosmologies, as well as the hydrodynamic simulation TNG300-1, using precise galaxy–halo connections from the Photometric objects Around Cosmic webs method and the accurate ray-tracing algorithm P3MLens. For rp > 70h−1 kpc, our magnification measurements are in good agreement with both WMAP and Planck cosmologies, resulting in an estimation of the matter fluctuation amplitude of S8 = 0.816 ± 0.024. However, at rp < 70h−1 kpc, we observe an excess magnification signal, which is higher than the DMO model in Planck cosmology at 2.8σ and would be exacerbated if significant baryon feedback is included. Implications of the potential small scale discrepancy for the nature of dark matter and for the processes governing galaxy formation are discussed.

<div> EMRI, gravitational-wave radiation, gaseous accretion disk, star-disk collisions, quasiperiodic eruption

总结:
本文研究了在星系核心中，一小部分星体向中心的超大质量黑洞运动，其轨道呈现低偏心率，被引力波辐射驱动。在这种缓慢的螺旋吸积过程中，很可能会形成一个气态吸积盘。如果这期间发生了恒星和盘的碰撞，就会产生符合观测到的准周期性喷发现象的短暂耀斑。研究者建立了星-盘耦合演化的模型，自洽地考虑了从恒星碰撞和相关物质剥离进入盘中所注入的质量和热能。对于弱碰撞/剥离加热，盘具有热不稳定性，并且经历极限循环振荡，从而调制其性质，并导致持续数年到数十年的以太循环发作。强烈的碰撞/剥离加热则稳定了盘，使其以接近EMRI剥离速率的大致恒定速率进行吸积。无论哪种情况，通过剥离的恒星破坏时间，因此最大的QPE寿命，大约是102到103年，远远长于TDE后的回流吸积。QPE源的平静吸积盘在目前阶段可能是自持续的，主要由EMRI剥离提供。实际上，观测到的长期变化范围与碰撞提供的盘预测相当。QPE重现模式的改变，类似于在GSN 069中观察到的，可能是由于在状态转换后EMRI供盘和SMBH赤道面之间暂时的错位所引起的。 <div>
A modest fraction of the stars in galactic nuclei fed toward the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) approach on low-eccentricity orbits driven by gravitational-wave radiation (extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI)). In the likely event that a gaseous accretion disk is created in the nucleus during this slow inspiral (e.g., via an independent tidal disruption event (TDE)), star–disk collisions generate regular short-lived flares consistent with the observed quasiperiodic eruption (QPE) sources. We present a model for the coupled star-disk evolution, which self-consistently accounts for mass and thermal energy injected into the disk from stellar collisions and associated mass ablation. For weak collision/ablation heating, the disk is thermally unstable and undergoes limit-cycle oscillations, which modulate its properties and lead to accretion-powered outbursts on timescales of years to decades, with a time-averaged accretion rate ∼0.1Ṁ Edd. Stronger collision/ablation heating acts to stabilize the disk, enabling roughly steady accretion at the EMRI-stripping rate. In either case, the stellar destruction time through ablation, and hence the maximum QPE lifetime, is ∼102–103 yr, far longer than fallback accretion after a TDE. The quiescent accretion disks in QPE sources may at the present epoch be self-sustaining and fed primarily by EMRI ablation. Indeed, the observed range of secular variability broadly matches those predicted for collision-fed disks. Changes in the QPE recurrence pattern following such outbursts, similar to that observed in GSN 069, could arise from temporary misalignment between the EMRI-fed disk and the SMBH equatorial plane as the former regrows its mass after a state transition.

<div> NGC 315, magnetic field strength, jet, black hole, magnetohydrodynamic model
<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了NGC 315射流中的磁场强度。首先，通过比较NGC 315的测量速度剖面与Tomimatsu和Takahashi提出的磁流体力学射流模型，估计了射流磁层中的角速度。类似于M87，我们发现该模型可以重现速度剖面的对数特征，并建议NGC 315具有一个缓慢旋转的黑洞磁层。通过将估计的ΩF代入Blandford-Znajek机制预测的射流功率中，我们估计了中心黑洞事件视界附近的磁场强度为5×10^3 G≲ BH ≲2×10^4 G。然后，通过比较通过长基线干涉测量（VLBI）观测获得的光谱指数分布与一个同步辐射射流模型，我们估计了射流中的磁场强度。然后，我们限制了离黑洞的去投影距离z的磁场强度在5.2×10^3 rg≲z≲4.9×10^4 rg范围内为0.06 G≲B(z)≲0.9 G，其中rg代表引力半径。通过结合事件视界和射流下游部分的获得的磁场强度，我们发现射流基部的吸积流与磁场阻滞盘一致。我们讨论了NGC 315和M87中射流功率和事件视界上锚定的磁通量的比较。 <div>
We study magnetic field strengths along the jet in NGC 315. First, we estimated the angular velocity of rotation in the jet magnetosphere by comparing the measured velocity profile of NGC 315 with the magnetohydrodynamic jet model proposed by Tomimatsu and Takahashi. Similar to the case of M87, we find that the model can reproduce the logarithmic feature of the velocity profile and suggest a slowly rotating black hole magnetosphere for NGC 315. By substituting the estimated ΩF into the jet power predicted by the Blandford–Znajek mechanism, we estimate the magnetic field strength near the event horizon of the central black hole as 5 × 103 G ≲ BH ≲ 2 × 104 G. We then estimate magnetic field strengths along the jet by comparing the spectral index distribution obtained from very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations with a synchrotron-emitting jet model. Then we constrain the magnetic field strength at a deprojected distance z from the black hole to be in the range 0.06 G ≲ B(z) ≲ 0.9 G for 5.2 × 103rg ≲ z ≲ 4.9 × 104rg, where rg represents the gravitational radius. By combining the obtained field strengths at the event horizon and the downstream section of the jet, we find that the accretion flow at the jet base is consistent with a magnetically arrested disk. We discuss a comparison of the jet power and the magnetic flux anchored to the event horizon in NGC 315 and M87.

总结:<br /><br />本文介绍了传统的单光纤光谱学在参数估计中可能存在的精度问题，以及积分场光谱单元（IFU）调查对减少污染的解决方案。通过使用从Apache Point Observatory IFU调查获得的见解，研究引入了一个新颖的模型，可以将星系光谱分解为SF和NonSF成分。将这一模型应用到Sloan Digital Sky Survey的数据集中，产生了两个独立的光谱。然后将这些分解后的光谱可视化在Baldwin、Phillips和Terlevich（BPT）图上，发现了有趣的模式。在BPT图上出现了非常显著的NonSF分解光谱的位置偏移，以及出现了两个明显的聚类。这一偏移突出了SF“污染”在影响NonSF光谱在BPT图上的位置上所扮演的关键角色。 <div>
Traditional single-fiber spectroscopy provides a single galaxy spectrum, forming the basis for crucial parameter estimation. However, its accuracy can be compromised by various sources of contamination, such as the prominent Hα emission line originating from both star-forming (SF) regions and non-star-forming (NonSF) regions, including active galactic nuclei. The potential to dissect a spectrum into its SF and NonSF constituents holds the promise of significantly enhancing precision in parameter estimates. In contrast, integral field unit (IFU) surveys present a solution to minimize contamination. These surveys examine spatially localized regions within galaxies, reducing the impact of mixed sources. Although an IFU survey’s resulting spectrum covers a smaller region of a galaxy than single-fiber spectroscopy, it can still encompass a blend of heterogeneous sources. Our study introduces an innovative model informed by insights from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory IFU survey. This model enables the decomposition of galaxy spectra, including those from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, into SF and NonSF components. Applying our model to these survey data sets produces two distinct spectra, one for SF and another for NonSF components, while conserving flux across wavelength bins. When these decomposed spectra are visualized on a Baldwin, Phillips, and Terlevich (BPT) diagram, interesting patterns emerge. There is a significant shift in the placement of the NonSF decomposed spectra, as well as the emergence of two distinct clusters in the Low-ionization Nuclear Emission-line Region and the Seyfert region. This shift highlights the key role of SF “contamination” in influencing the positioning of NonSF spectra within the BPT diagram.

This paper demonstrates the impact of state-of-the-art instrumental calibration techniques on the precision of arrival times obtained from 9.6 yr of observations of millisecond pulsars using the Murriyang 64 m CSIRO Parkes Radio Telescope. Our study focuses on 21 cm observations of 25 high-priority pulsars that are regularly observed as part of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array project, including those predicted to be the most susceptible to calibration errors. We employ measurement equation template matching (METM) for instrumental calibration and matrix template matching (MTM) for arrival time estimation, resulting in significantly improved timing residuals with up to a sixfold reduction in white noise compared to arrival times estimated using scalar template matching and conventional calibration based on the ideal feed assumption. The median relative reduction in white noise is 33%, and the maximum absolute reduction is 4.5 μs. For PSR J0437−4715, METM and MTM reduce the best-fit power-law amplitude (2.7σ) and spectral index (1.7σ) of the red noise in the arrival time residuals, which can be tentatively interpreted as mitigation of 1/f noise due to otherwise unmodeled steps in polarimetric response. These findings demonstrate the potential to directly enhance the sensitivity of pulsar timing array experiments through more accurate methods of instrumental calibration and arrival time estimation.

The 18O(p, α)15N reaction is of particular importance for influencing the abundances of key isotopes such as 19F, 18O, and 15N. Peculiar abundances for these nuclei are observed from spectra or meteorite grains originating in asymptotic giant branch stars. The 18O(p, α)15N could provide a way to explain the discrepancy between the observations and model predictions. A comprehensive R-matrix analysis has been performed for the 18O(p, α)15N reaction by including additional constraints from other reaction channels; in particular, the 15N+α scattering data were involved in the analysis for the first time. All available data were compiled and used in the R-matrix analysis. The fitted resonance parameters are compared with previous works. A revised determination of reaction rate has been extracted, relying on the present fitting parameters. The uncertainties on the corresponding reaction rates were then obtained by a Monte Carlo analysis.

<title>A Phase-resolved View of “Heartbeat”-like Variability in IGR J17091-3624 during the 2022 Outburst</title>

<div> 黑洞X射线双星，IGR J17091–3624，心跳变化，相位分析，高能X射线流量，光谱分析，盘温度和流量的同步变化，逆关联的Compton散射组件变化。<br /><br />总结:
本研究对IGR J17091–3624在2022年的爆发期间进行了详细的相位分析，发现软X射线闪耀在峰值相位存在∼15σ的高能量缺失。同时，光谱分析显示，盘温度和流量与计数率呈现显著的同步变化，暗示着闪耀主要由于黑洞周围的不稳定引起，这与之前对GRS 1915+105的研究结果一致。然而，我们观察到盘温度和流量之间存在正相关关系，这与Class ρ变化中发现的参数之间的环路关系不同，这可能暗示着两种变化类别之间的物理过程存在差异。此外，在闪耀期间还观察到Compton散射组件的变化：电子温度和覆盖分数与盘流量呈反相关，显示出盘和顶盖之间潜在的相互作用。 <div>
IGR J17091–3624, in addition to GRS 1915 + 105, is the only black hole X-ray binary that displays “heartbeat”-like variability, characterized by structured flares with high amplitudes. In this study, we conduct a detailed phase-resolved analysis of the recently identified “heartbeat”-like Class X variability in IGR J17091–3624 during its 2022 outburst, utilizing data from NICER and NuSTAR observations. A shortage in the high-energy (>20 keV) X-ray flux is detected at peak phases of the soft-X-ray flare at a ∼15σ confidence level from the phase-folded light curves. Furthermore, our phase-resolved spectral analysis reveals variations in the spectral shape, particularly showing significant synchronous variations in the disk temperature and flux with the count rate. These findings imply that the flare is primarily driven by instabilities within the accretion disk, consistent with previous studies of the well-known Class ρ variability in GRS 1915+105. However, we also observe a positive correlation between the disk temperature and flux over the flare cycle, which differs from the loop relation between the two parameters found in the Class ρ variability. This could suggest differences in the underlying physical processes between the two variability classes. Variations in the Comptonization component during flares are also observed: the electron temperature and covering fraction show anticorrelations with the disk flux, revealing potential interactions between the accretion disk and the corona during these flares.

<br />
这篇文章研究了四颗环绕M矮星的系外行星，即TOI-1685, GJ 436, GJ 3470, 和 TOI-2445，并使用Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV APOGEE调查的高分辨率近红外光谱进行了详细的恒星参数和元素丰度分析。从28颗M矮星的分析结果中发现，环绕系外行星的M矮星表现出略高的C/O丰度比，表明这些M矮星可能更适合于观测地球类和超地球行星的大气。此外，通过C/Mg、Si/Mg、Al/Mg和Fe/Mg的丰度比，确定了TOI-2445 b的质量，并发现其密度和核心质量分数与地球非常相似。文章还提供了M矮星在H波段的113条明确定义的光谱线图谱和各种不确定性的综合评估。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
Exoplanets hosting M dwarfs are the best targets to characterize Earth-like or super-Earth planetary atmospheres with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We determine detailed stellar parameters (Teff, logg, and ξ) and individual abundances of 12 elements for four cool M dwarfs hosting exoplanets TOI-1685, GJ 436, GJ 3470, and TOI-2445, scheduled for future observations by the JWST. The analysis utilizes high-resolution near-infrared spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV APOGEE survey between 1.51 and 1.69 μm. Based on 1D LTE plane-parallel models, we find that TOI-2445 is slightly metal poor ([Fe/H] = −0.16 ± 0.09 dex), while TOI-1685, GJ 436, and GJ 3470 are more metal rich ([Fe/H] = 0.06 ± 0.18, 0.10 ± 0.20, and 0.25 ± 0.15 dex, respectively). The derived C/O ratios for TOI-2445, TOI-1685, GJ 436, and GJ 3470 are 0.526 ± 0.027, 0.558 ± 0.097, 0.561 ± 0.029, and 0.638 ± 0.015, respectively. From the results for 28 M dwarfs analyzed homogeneously from Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) spectra, we find exoplanet-hosting M dwarfs exhibit a C/O abundance ratio approximately 0.01–0.05 higher than those with nondetected exoplanets, at limits of a statistically significant offset. A linear regression of the [Fe/H] versus C/O distribution reveals a noticeable difference in the angular coefficient between FGK dwarfs (0.27) and M dwarfs (0.13). Assuming our abundance ratios of Ca/Mg, Si/Mg, Al/Mg, and Fe/Mg, we determine a mass of M⊕ for TOI-2445 b, which has a density (6.793 g cm−3) and core mass fraction (0.329 ) very similar to Earth’s. We also present an atlas of 113 well-defined spectral lines to analyze M dwarfs in the H band and a comprehensive evaluation of uncertainties from variations in the atmospheric parameters, signal-to-noise ratio, and pseudocontinuum.

通过对弥散的北方扩展毫米阵列天文台观测CH3OH和CH3CN进行分析，研究人员发现这两种分子在中等质量原恒星周围的原行星盘中的空间分布不同。CH3OH和CH3CN的旋转图表分析表明，它们具有不同的旋转温度，分别为198 ± 1.2 K和448 ± 19 K，这暗示着它们的空间分布不同。进一步的3D LTE辐射传输模型表明，CH3OH的空间分布均匀，且丰度为4×10−8。相比之下，CH3CN的空间分布要么更加紧凑（在∼120 au内），要么在内∼55 au的地方丰度增加了≳15倍。这种CH3OH和CH3CN空间丰度分布差异的可能解释是碳颗粒的升华。 <br /><br />总结:CH3OH和CH3CN的旋转温度不同，表明它们在原行星盘中的空间分布不同；CH3OH的空间分布均匀，丰度为4×10−8；相比之下，CH3CN的空间分布要么更加紧凑，要么在内∼55 au的地方丰度增加了≳15倍；这种差异可能是由碳颗粒的升华引起的。 <div>
Observations of low-mass protostellar systems show evidence of rich, complex organic chemistry. Their low luminosity, however, makes determining abundance distributions of complex organic molecules within the water snowline challenging. However, the excitation conditions sampled by differing molecular distributions may produce substantive changes in the resulting emission. Thus, molecular excitation may recover spatial information from spatially unresolved data. By analyzing spatially unresolved NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array observations of CH3OH and CH3CN, we aim to determine if CH3OH and CH3CN are distributed differently in the protostellar disk around HOPS-370, a highly luminous intermediate-mass protostar. Rotational diagram analysis of CH3OH and CH3CN yields rotational temperatures of 198 ± 1.2 K and 448 ± 19 K, respectively, suggesting the two molecules have different spatial distributions. Source-specific 3D LTE radiative transfer models are used to constrain the spatial distribution of CH3OH and CH3CN within the disk. A uniform distribution with an abundance of 4 × 10−8 reproduces the CH3OH observations. In contrast, the spatial distribution of CH3CN needs to be either more compact (within ∼120 au versus ∼240 au for CH3OH) or exhibit a factor of ≳15 increase in abundance in the inner ∼55 au. A possible explanation for the difference in spatial abundance distributions of CH3OH and CH3CN is carbon-grain sublimation.

Abell 514 (A514) at z = 0.071 is an intriguing merging system exhibiting highly elongated (∼1 Mpc) X-ray features and three large-scale (300 ∼ 500 kpc) bent radio jets. To dissect this system with its multiwavelength data, it is critical to robustly identify and quantify its dark matter substructures. We present a weak-lensing analysis of A514 using deep Magellan/Megacam observations. Combining two optical band filter imaging data obtained under optimal seeing (∼0.″6) and leveraging the proximity of A514, we achieve a high source density of or ∼6940 Mpc−2, which enables high-resolution mass reconstruction. We unveil the complex dark matter substructures of A514, which are characterized by the NW and SE subclusters separated by ∼0.7 Mpc, each exhibiting a bimodal mass distribution. The total mass of the NW subcluster is estimated to be and is further resolved into the eastern ( and western ( ) components. The mass of the SE subcluster is , which is also further resolved into the northern ( ) and southern ( ) components. These four substructures coincide with the A514 brightest galaxies and are detected with significances ranging from 3.3σ to 4.7σ. Comparison of the dark matter substructures with the X-ray distribution suggests that A514 might have experienced an off-axis collision, and the NW and SE subclusters are currently near their apocenters.

总结: 
本文报道了对太阳日冕的超高分辨率观测，发现了持续约20小时的等离子体/电流层以及太阳日冕中的准周期磁重联现象。研究观察到的电流层出现在一个风扇-脊拓扑结构的无故障点附近，并持续存在。这个电流层的长度约为6″，宽度约2″，等离子体温度约为10-20MK。研究还观察到在磁重联点/电流层处有准周期的等离子体流入和流出。此外，长时间的准周期磁重联产生了反复爆发 (小型耀斑和喷流)，并对活跃区域的脉冲加热产生了显著影响。这些前所未有的观察为太阳耀斑通用模型（即断层模型）提供了有力证据，并对活跃区域通过无故障点附近的反复磁重联产生脉冲加热有重要意义。这条持续约20小时的断层电流层上的延续和持续磁重联为太阳日冕的动力学和能量释放过程提供了新的见解。 <br /><br /> <div>
Magnetic reconnection is widely believed to be the fundamental process in the solar atmosphere that underlies magnetic energy release and particle acceleration. This process is responsible for the onset of solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and other explosive events (e.g., jets). Here, we report direct imaging of a prolonged plasma/current sheet along with quasiperiodic magnetic reconnection in the solar corona using ultra-high-resolution observations from the 1.6 m Goode Solar Telescope at the Big Bear Solar Observatory and the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly. The current sheet appeared near a null point in the fan–spine topology and persisted over an extended period (≈20 hr). The length and apparent width of the current sheet were about 6″ and 2″, respectively, and the plasma temperature was ≈10–20 MK. We observed quasiperiodic plasma inflows and outflows (bidirectional jets with plasmoids) at the reconnection site/current sheet. Furthermore, quasiperiodic reconnection at the long-lasting current sheet produced recurrent eruptions (small flares and jets) and contributed significantly to the recurrent impulsive heating of the active region. Direct imaging of a plasma/current sheet and recurrent null-point reconnection for such an extended period has not been reported previously. These unprecedented observations provide compelling evidence that supports the universal model for solar eruptions (i.e., the breakout model) and have implications for impulsive heating of active regions by recurrent reconnection near null points. The prolonged and sustained reconnection for about 20 hr at the breakout current sheet provides new insights into the dynamics and energy release processes in the solar corona.

The neutrino-driven wind cooling phase of proto-neutron stars (PNSs) follows successful supernovae. Wind models without magnetic fields or rotation fail to achieve the necessary conditions for production of the third r-process peak, but robustly produce a weak r-process in neutron-rich winds. Using 2D magnetohydrodynamic simulations with magnetar-strength magnetic fields and rotation, we show that the PNS rotation rate significantly affects the thermodynamic conditions of the wind. We show that high-entropy material is quasiperiodically ejected from the closed zone of the PNS magnetosphere with the required thermodynamic conditions to produce heavy elements. We show that maximum entropy S of the material ejected depends systematically on the magnetar spin period P⋆ and scales as for sufficiently rapid rotation. We present results from simulations at a constant neutrino luminosity representative of ∼1–2 s after the onset of cooling for P⋆ ranging from 5–200 ms and a few simulations with evolving neutrino luminosity where we follow the evolution of the magnetar wind until 10–14 s after the onset of cooling. We estimate at magnetar polar magnetic field strength B0 = 3 × 1015 G and 1015 G that neutron-rich magnetar winds can, respectively, produce at least ∼1–5 × 10−5M⊙ and ∼1–4 × 10−7M⊙ of material with the required parameters for synthesis of the third r-process peak, within 1–2 s and 10 s, respectively, in that order after the onset of cooling. We show that proton-rich magnetar winds can have favorable conditions for production of p-nuclei, even at a modest B0 = 5 × 1014 G.

We combine a new Galactic plane survey of hydrogen radio recombination lines (RRLs) with far-infrared surveys of ionized nitrogen, N+, to determine nitrogen abundance across Galactic radius. RRLs were observed with the NASA Deep Space Network Station 43 70 m antenna and the Green Bank Telescope in 108 lines of sight spanning −135°< l < 60°, at b = 0°. These positions were also observed in [N ii] 122 μm and 205 μm lines with the Herschel Space Observatory. Combining RRL and [N ii] 122 μm and 205 μm observations in 41 of 108 samples with high signal-to-noise ratio, we studied the ionized nitrogen abundance distribution across Galactocentric distances of 0–8 kpc. Combined with existing solar neighborhood and outer Galaxy N/H abundance determinations, we studied this quantity’s distribution within the Milky Way’s inner 17 kpc for the first time. We found a nitrogen abundance gradient extending from Galactocentric radii of 4–17 kpc in the Galactic plane, while within 0–4 kpc the N/H distribution remained flat. The gradient observed at large Galactocentric distances supports inside-out galaxy growth, with the additional steepening resulting from variable star formation efficiency and/or radial flows in the Galactic disk, while the inner 4 kpc flattening, coinciding with the Galactic bar’s onset, may be linked to radial flows induced by the bar potential. Using SOFIA/FIFI-LS and Herschel/PACS, we observed the [N iii] 57 μm line to trace doubly ionized gas contribution in a subsample of sight lines. We found negligible N++ contributions along these sight lines, suggesting mostly singly ionized nitrogen originating from low-ionization H ii region outskirts.

We present follow-up spectroscopy and a detailed model atmosphere analysis of 29 wide double white dwarfs, including eight systems with a crystallized C/O core member. We use the state-of-the-art evolutionary models to constrain the physical parameters of each star, including the total age. Assuming that the members of wide binaries are coeval, any age difference between the binary members can be used to test the cooling physics for white dwarf stars, including potential delays due to crystallization and 22Ne distillation. We use our control sample of 14 wide binaries with noncrystallized members to show that this method works well; the control sample shows an age difference of only ΔAge = −0.03 ± 0.15 Gyr between its members. For the eight crystallized C/O core systems we find a cooling anomaly of ΔAge = Gyr. Even though our results are consistent with a small additional cooling delay (∼1 Gyr) from 22Ne distillation and other neutron-rich impurities, the large uncertainties make this result not statistically significant. Nevertheless, we rule out cooling delays longer than 3.6 Gyr at the 99.7% (3σ) confidence level for 0.6–0.9 M⊙ white dwarfs. Further progress requires larger samples of wide binaries with crystallized massive white dwarf members. We provide a list of subgiant + white dwarf binaries that could be used for this purpose in the future.

本文对通过Green Bank Observatory的20米望远镜对蟹状星云脉冲星在1.55GHz频率下的巨型脉冲进行了研究。通过探讨高频率下的屈折闪烁效应及其校正方法，识别了其他单脉冲源和射电暴的确定性模式，寻找了旋转射电瞬变体和快速射电暴的可能周期性，以及是否存在类似于重复快速射电暴FRB 121102中的巨型脉冲聚类现象。 <div>
A small number of pulsars are known to emit giant pulses (GPs), single pulses much brighter than average. Among these is PSR J0534+2200, also known as the Crab pulsar, a young pulsar with high GP rates. Long-term monitoring of the Crab pulsar presents an excellent opportunity to perform statistical studies of its GPs and the processes affecting them, potentially providing insight into the behavior of other neutron stars that emit bright single pulses. Here, we present an analysis of a set of 24,985 Crab GPs obtained from 88 hr of daily observations at a center frequency of 1.55 GHz by the 20 m telescope at the Green Bank Observatory, spread over 461 days. We study the effects of refractive scintillation at higher frequencies than previous studies and compare methods of correcting for this effect. We also search for deterministic patterns seen in other single-pulse sources, possible periodicities seen in several rotating radio transients and fast radio bursts, and clustering of GPs like that seen in the repeating fast radio burst FRB 121102.

Summary:<br />
研究认为伽马射线暴（GRB）的中心引擎会产生一对相对运动的喷射流，即朝向我们的向前喷射流和远离我们的逆向喷射流。GRB 170817A是一个与双中子星合并事件相关的短爆发，具有非常适合搜索逆向喷射流辐射的能量向前喷射流。然而，目前对逆向喷射流的检测前景并不乐观。如果逆向喷射流的冲击参数（ϵe和ϵB）比向前冲击的要高，逆向喷射流的余辉辐射将会增强，可能会被检测到。未来，JWST在F356W波段的几小时曝光将严格测试这种情景。 <br />总结: <br />GRB中心引擎产生对向喷射流，GRB 170817A是一个适合研究的事件，但逆向喷射流的检测前景不明朗，通过调整冲击参数或许可以增强探测逆向喷射流的可能性，未来JWST观测将有望提供更多证据。 <div>
The central engine of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) is widely believed to launch a pair of oppositely moving jets, i.e., the forward jet moving toward us and the counter jet regressing away. The forward jet generates the radiation typically observed in GRBs, while the counter jet has not been detected yet due to its dimness. GRB 170817A, a short burst associated with a binary neutron star merger event, is a nearby event (z = 0.0097) with an off-axis structured energetic forward jet and hence probably the most suitable target for searching the counter jet radiation. Assuming the same properties for the forward and counter jet components as well as the shock parameters, the fit to the multiwavelength afterglow emission of GRB 170817A suggests a peak time ∼quite a few ×103 day of the counter jet radiation, but the detection prospect of this new component is not promising. Anyhow, if the shock parameters (ϵe and ϵB) of the counter jet component are (a few times) higher than that of the forward shock, e.g., the posterior results of the magnetic energy fraction of the forward shock and the counter jet are and , respectively, as still allowed by the current data, the counter jet afterglow emission will be enhanced and hence may be detected. A few hours of exposure by JWST in the F356W band will stringently test such a scenario.

<br /><br />总结:
本文讨论了超地球和迷你海王星这两种最常见的系外行星类型的形成物理学问题。研究发现，标准的核心聚集模型在富气环境中预测，典型的迷你海王星质量的行星在基础盘气体消散之前会膨胀成类木行星。最新提出的从原行星盘向形成的气态包层注入的熵机制被认为能延迟这种失控的吸积过程，尤其是在短轨道距离上。然而，通过数值一维热力学模型重新评估这一推理时发现，如果可以将气体再循环流量渗透到行星重力范围的约0.25以下，那么在0.1天文单位处，这些对流流量只能产生迷你海王星。否则，气体对核心质量比（GCR）将超过约10%，这太大了，不能解释迷你海王星的测量特性，必须有其他限制气体的过程，比如在后期核聚集过程中。熵对气体吸积的影响在0.1天文单位以外进一步减弱。文章还提出了GCR和对流流量渗透深度之间的更新比例关系，这个关系随着轨道距离、核质量和含尘与无尘的不透明度变化而呈现出复杂的变化。我们进一步展示了如何利用未来的仪器（如南茜·格雷斯·罗曼空间望远镜）对1天文单位以外的行星质量分布进行测量，以将不同形成条件下的低气体行星区分开来。 <div>
Super-Earths and mini-Neptunes are the most common types of exoplanets discovered, yet the physics of their formation are still debated. Standard core accretion models in gas-rich environments find that typical mini-Neptune mass planets would blow up into Jupiters before the underlying disk gas dissipates away. The injection of entropy from the protoplanetary disk into forming gaseous envelopes has recently been put forward as a mechanism to delay this runaway accretion, specifically at short orbital distances. Here, we reevaluate this line of reasoning by incorporating recycling flows of gas into a numerical one-dimensional thermodynamic model with a more realistic equation of state and opacities and the thermal state of the advective flow. At 0.1 au, we find that advective flows are only able to produce mini-Neptunes if they can penetrate below ∼0.25 of the planet’s gravitational sphere of influence. Otherwise, the gas-to-core mass ratio (GCR) reaches above ∼10%, which is too large to explain the measured properties of mini-Neptunes, necessitating other gas-limiting processes such as late-time core assembly. The effect of entropy advection on gas accretion weakens even further beyond 0.1 au. We present an updated scaling relation between GCR and the penetration depth of the advective flows, which varies nontrivially with orbital distances, core masses, and dusty versus dust-free opacity. We further demonstrate how measurements of planet mass distribution beyond ∼1 au using future instruments such as the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope could be used to disambiguate between different formation conditions of gas-poor planets.

<div> 关键词: Hubble常数，距离梯子，宇宙微波背景，JWST观测，红巨星分支距离

Hubble常数的局部值通过距离梯子与基于标准ΛCDM模型的宇宙微波背景推断的值之间的差异已经达到5σ显著性。为了确定这一差异是由新物理还是更平凡的系统误差造成的，必须尽可能多地消除系统性不确定性，通过建立独立于传统Cepheid和Ia超新星路径的高精度距离梯子。在本文中，我们展示了对三个Fornax星系团早型星系的JWST观测，这是来自Cycle 2 JWST计划的14次观测中的第一次。我们的适度积分时间使我们能够测量高精度的红巨星分支尖端（TRGB）距离，它们还将用于进行表面亮度波动（SBF）的测量。从这三个星系中，我们确定了Fornax星系团的TRGB平均距离模数为μ = 31.424 ± 0.077等或D = 19.3 ± 0.7 Mpc。随着其他11次观测计划在附近的椭圆星系中，我们的计划将使我们能够将SBF比例的零点调整到更远距离的测量中的不到2％，为独立于传统Cepheid–超新星Ia距离梯子的高精度H0测量打下基础。 <br /><br />总结: Hubble常数的局部值与宇宙微波背景推断的值之间存在显著差异，通过JWST观测，我们得到了Fornax星系团的TRGB距离，这将为独立于传统距离梯子的高精度H0测量奠定基础。 <div>
Differences between the local value of the Hubble constant measured via the distance ladder versus the value inferred from the cosmic microwave background with the assumption of the standard ΛCDM model have reached over 5σ significance. To determine if this discrepancy is due to new physics or more mundane systematic errors, it is essential to remove as many sources of systematic uncertainty as possible, by developing high-precision distance ladders that are independent of the traditional Cepheid and Type Ia supernova route. Here, we present JWST observations of three early-type Fornax Cluster galaxies, the first of 14 observations from a Cycle 2 JWST program. Our modest integration times allow us to measure highly precise tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distances and they will also be used to perform measurements of surface brightness fluctuations (SBFs). From these three galaxies, we determine an average TRGB distance modulus to the Fornax Cluster of μ = 31.424 ± 0.077 mag or D = 19.3 ± 0.7 Mpc. With 11 more scheduled observations in nearby elliptical galaxies, our program will allow us to set the zero-point of the SBF scale to better than 2% for more distant measurements, charting a path toward a high-precision measurement of H0 that is independent of the traditional Cepheid–supernova Ia distance ladder.

Satellite galaxies can be used to indicate the dynamic mass of galaxy groups and clusters. In this study, we apply the axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Multi-Gaussian Expansion (JAM) modeling to satellite galaxies in 28 galaxy clusters selected from the TNG300-1 simulation with halo masses of . If using true bound satellites as tracers, the best constrained total mass within the half-mass radius of satellites, M(<rhalf); yet most of the best constraints are still consistent with the true profiles within 1σ statistical uncertainties for the three circumstances. Using a mock DESI Bright Galaxy Survey catalog with the effect of fiber incompleteness, we find DESI fiber assignments and the choice of flux limits barely modify the velocity dispersion profiles and are thus unlikely to affect the dynamical modeling outcomes. Our results show that with current and future deep spectroscopic surveys, JAM can be a powerful tool to constrain the underlying density profiles of individual massive galaxy clusters.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究发现了固体CH4是通过连续的氢化C原子形成的，C原子存在于物理吸附态或化学吸附态。结果表明，只有物理吸附态的C原子才能在冰上产生CH4。结合先前对冰上物理吸附态C原子的比例估计，我们确定了C原子转化为CH4的上限为30%。这一发现对于了解星际介质中C原子的氢化反应有着重要的意义。 <div>
Methane (CH4) is one of the major components of the icy mantle of cosmic dust prevalent in cold, dense regions of interstellar media, playing an important role in the synthesis of complex organic molecules and prebiotic molecules. Solid CH4 is considered to be formed via the successive hydrogenation of C atoms accreting onto dust: C + 4H → CH4. However, most astrochemical models assume this reaction on the ice mantles of dust to be barrierless and efficient, without considering the states of adsorption. Recently, we found that C atoms exist in either the physisorbed or chemisorbed state on compact amorphous solid water, which is analogous to an interstellar ice mantle. These distinct adsorption states considerably affect the hydrogenation reactivity of the C atom. Herein, we elucidate the reactivities of physisorbed and chemisorbed C atoms with H atoms via sequential deposition and codeposition processes. The results indicate that only physisorbed C atoms can produce CH4 on ice. Combining this finding with a previous estimate for the fraction of physisorbed C atoms on ice, we determined the upper limit for the conversion of C atoms into CH4 to be 30%.

<div> 关键词: Fermi, eROSITA, Galaxy, star formation, Galactic wind

总结: 
Fermi和eROSITA泡泡是银河系中的大型弥散结构，可能是稳定恒星形成活动的副产品。为了同时解释银河系的恒星形成历史和银河盘的金属丰度约为Z⊙，需要由宇宙射线驱动的稳定银河风。该风动力学模型符合银河演化场景，表明泡泡是持久存在的银河结构，而不是非同寻常的、约10百万年前的银心瞬变活动形成的短暂结构。风的一部分回落到盘上，形成银河喷泉流，其X射线和强子伽马射线的尺度高度和表面亮度与观测到的Fermi和eROSITA泡泡的性质一致。 <div>
The Fermi and eROSITA bubbles (FBs and eRBs), large diffuse structures in our Galaxy, can be the by-products of steady star formation activity. To simultaneously explain the star formation history of the Milky Way (MW) and the metallicity of ∼Z⊙ at the Galactic disk, a steady Galactic wind driven by cosmic rays (CRs) is required. For tenuous gases with a density of ≲10−3 cm−3, CR heating dominates over radiative cooling, and the gas can maintain the virial temperature of ∼0.3 keV, ideal for escape from the Galactic system as the wind. A part of the wind falls back onto the disk like a Galactic fountain flow. We model the wind dynamics according to the Galactic evolution scenario and find that the scale height and surface brightness of the X-ray and the hadronic gamma-ray emissions from such fountain flow region can be consistent with the observed properties of the FBs and eRBs. This implies that the bubbles are persistent structures of the MW existing over (at least) the last ∼1 Gyr rather than evanescent structures formed by nontrivial, ∼10 Myr past Galactic center transient activities.

<title>CANUCS: An Updated Mass and Magnification Model of A370 with JWST</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present an updated mass and magnification model of galaxy cluster A370 using new NIRCam, NIRISS, and NIRSpec data from the Canadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). Using Lenstool and a combination of archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and MUSE data with new JWST data as constraints, we derive an improved gravitational lensing model and extract magnifications of background galaxies with uncertainties. Using our best fit model, we perform a search for new multiply imaged systems via predicted positions. We report no new multiply imaged systems with identifiable redshifts, likely due to already very deep HST and Spitzer data but confirm a z ∼ 8 multiply imaged system by measuring its redshift with NIRISS and NIRSpec spectra. We find that the overall shape of the critical curve for a source at z = 9.0 is similar to previous models of A370, with small changes. We investigate the z ∼ 8 galaxy with two images observable with an apparent magnitude in the F125W band of 26.0 ± 0.2 and 25.6 ± 0.1. After correcting for the magnifications of the images, and , we use spectral energy distribution fitting to find an intrinsic stellar mass of log(M*/M⊙) = , intrinsic star formation rate of M⊙ yr−1, and MUV of −21.3 , which is close to the knee of the luminosity function at that redshift. Our model, and corresponding magnification, shear, and convergence maps are available on request and will be made publicly available on MAST in a CANUCS data release (doi:10.17909/ph4n-6n76).

<title>Observations of Kappa Distributions in Solar Energetic Protons and Derived Thermodynamic Properties</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this paper, we model the high-energy tail of observed solar energetic proton energy distributions with a kappa distribution function. We employ a technique for deriving the thermodynamic parameters of solar energetic proton populations measured by the Parker Solar Probe Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun EPI-Hi high-energy telescope, over energies from 10 to 60 MeV. With this technique, we explore, for the first time, the characteristic thermodynamic properties of the solar energetic protons associated with an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) and its driven shock. We find that: (1) the spectral index or, equivalently, the thermodynamic parameter kappa of solar energetic protons (κEP) gradually increases, starting from the pre-ICME region (upstream of the CME-driven shock), reaching a maximum in the CME ejecta (κEP ≈ 3.5), followed by a gradual decrease throughout the trailing portion of the CME; (2) the solar energetic proton temperature and density (TEP and nEP) appear anticorrelated, a behavior consistent with subisothermal polytropic processes; and (3) values of TEP and κEP appear to be positively correlated, indicating an increasing entropy with time. Therefore, these proton populations are characterized by a complex and evolving thermodynamic behavior, consisting of multiple subisothermal polytropic processes, and a large-scale trend of increasing temperature, kappa, and entropy. This study and its companion study by Livadiotis et al. open up a new set of procedures for investigating the thermodynamic behavior of energetic particles and their shared thermal properties.

<title>Constraining Wind-driven Accretion onto Gaia BH3 with Chandra</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Gaia BH3 is the most massive known stellar-origin black hole in the Milky Way, with a mass M• ≈ 33 M⊙. Detected from Gaia’s astrometry, this black hole is in the mass range of those observed via gravitational waves, whose nature is still highly debated. Hosted in a binary system with a companion giant star that is too far away for Roche-lobe mass transfer, this black hole could nonetheless accrete at low levels due to wind-driven mass loss from its companion star, thus accreting in advection-dominated accretion flow, or ADAF, mode. Using stellar wind models, we constrain its Eddington ratio in the range 10−9 < fEdd < 10−7, corresponding to radiative efficiencies 5 × 10−5 < ϵ < 10−3, compatible with radiatively inefficient accretion modes. Chandra ACIS-S observed this object and obtained the most sensitive upper bound of its [2–10] keV flux: FX < 3.25 × 10−15 erg s−1 cm−2 at 90% confidence level corresponding to L[2–10] < 2.10 × 1029 erg s−1. Using ADAF emission models, we constrained its accretion rate to fEdd < 4.91 × 10−7 at the apastron, in agreement with our theoretical estimate. At the periastron, we expect fluxes ∼50 times larger. Because of the inferred low rates, accretion did not significantly contribute to black hole growth over the system’s lifetime. Detecting the electromagnetic emission from Gaia BH3 will be fundamental to informing stellar wind and accretion disk models.

The AGILE space mission was launched in 2007 to study X-ray and gamma-ray astrophysics. AGILE operated in spinning mode from 2009 until 2024 February 14, when it re-entered the Earth’s atmosphere. This work uses data acquired from the AGILE anticoincidence system (ACS) from 2019 January 1 to 2022 December 31. The ACS is designed to reject charged background particles. It also detects X-ray photons in the 50–200 KeV energy range and saves each panel count rate in the telemetry as ratemeter data, a time series with a resolution of 1.024 s. We developed a method that uses a deep learning model to predict the background count rates of the AGILE ACS top panel (perpendicular to the pointing direction of the payload detectors) using the satellite’s orbital parameters as input. Then, we use the difference between predicted and acquired count rates to detect gamma-ray bursts (GRB). We trained the model with a background-only data set. After the training, the model can predict the ACS count rates with a mean reconstruction error of 3.8%. We used the GRBs listed in the GRBweb catalog to search for significant anomalies in the ACS data. We extracted light curves of 140 bins of 1.024 s for each GRB from the AGILE ACS to cover the trigger time of the GRBs. The model detected 39 GRBs with a significance of σ ≥ 3. The results contain four GRBs detected for the first time in the AGILE data.

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) as the most energetic explosions in the modern universe have been studied for over half a century, but the physics of the particle acceleration and radiation responsible for their observed spectral behaviors are still not well understood. Based on the comprehensive analysis of the pulse properties in both bright GRB 160625B and GRB 160509A, for the first time, we identify evidence of particle acceleration by relativistic magnetic reconnection from the evolutionary behavior of the two spectral breaks Ep and Ecut. Meanwhile, the adiabatic cooling process of the emitting particles in the magnetic reconnection regions produces a relation between the spectral index and the flux. We also discuss the physics behind spectral energy correlations. Finally, we argue that the identification of an anticorrelation between Ecut and Liso may open a new avenue for diagnostics of the physics of the particle acceleration and radiation in a variety of astrophysical sources.

Solar spicules are plasma jets observed in the interface region between the visible solar surface and the corona. At any given time, there is a forest of spicules originating in the chromosphere of the Sun. While various models attempt to elucidate their origin and characteristics, here, we consider the one driven by the magnetoconvection undulations. The radiative magnetohydrodynamic (rMHD) equations are solved using Pencil Code with a spatial resolution of 16 km using various magnetic field strengths. The obtained rMHD simulation data are investigated to unveil the various trends in spicular properties as a function of the applied magnetic fields. The important outcome of this study is the finding of a consistent reduction in both the number density and the maximum height reached by spicules as magnetic field strength increases. We also use parabolic fitting on time–distance curves of spicules that are taller than the 75th percentile in the distribution, in order to find a relation between the deceleration of the spicule tip and the magnetic field strength. Our results offer insights into the response of solar spicules to magnetic field strength.

Understanding the mechanisms underlying the heating of the solar atmosphere is a fundamental problem in solar physics. The lower atmosphere of the Sun (i.e., photosphere and chromosphere) is composed of weakly ionized plasma. This results in anisotropic dissipation of electric currents by Coulomb and Cowling resistivities. Joule heating due to dissipation of currents perpendicular to the magnetic field by Cowling resistivity has been demonstrated to be the main mechanism for the heating of a sunspot umbral light bridge located in NOAA AR 12002 on 2014 March 13. Here, we focus on the same target region and demonstrate the importance of further constraining our Joule heating model using observational data in addition to magnetic field, namely plasma temperature calculated from the inversion of spectroscopic data obtained from the Interferometric BI-dimensional Spectrometer instrument of the ground-based Dunn Solar Telescope. As a parameter in our analysis, temperature is demonstrated to have the highest sensitivity after magnetic field. We show that the heating of the light bridge is a highly dynamic event that necessitates utilization of 3D spatially resolved observational data for temperature rather than a 1D temperature stratification based on theoretical/semiempirical solar atmosphere models. Our improved data-constrained analysis using spatially resolved temperatures shows that the entire light bridge is heated by the proposed mechanism, and yields heating rate values that are consistent with our previous study.

We present a pipeline to identify photometric variability within strong gravitationally lensing candidates, in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Imaging Surveys. In our first paper, we laid out our pipeline and presented seven new gravitationally lensed supernovae candidates in a retrospective search. In this companion paper, we apply a modified version of that pipeline to search for gravitationally lensed quasars. From a sample of 5807 strong lenses, we have identified 13 new gravitationally lensed quasar candidates (three of them quadruply lensed). We note that our methodology differs from most lensed quasar search algorithms that solely rely on the morphology, location, and color of the candidate systems. By also accounting for the temporal photometric variability of the posited lensed images in our search via difference imaging, we have discovered new lensed quasar candidates. While variability searches using difference imaging algorithms have been done in the past, they are typically performed over vast swathes of the sky, whereas we specifically target strong gravitationally lensed candidates. We also have applied our pipeline to 655 known gravitationally lensed quasar candidates from past lensed quasar searches, of which we identified 13 that display significant variability (one of them quadruply lensed). This pipeline demonstrates a promising search strategy to discover gravitationally lensed quasars in other existing and upcoming surveys.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究使用了Gemini South的自适应光学系统对五个快速射电暴（FRB）的宿主星系进行了观测，并研究了这些FRB与宿主星系光分布的空间分布和位置关系。研究发现，FRB与宿主星系的中位偏移距离为2.09个半光半径（re），并且这些FRB在宿主星系中出现在较暗的区域。进一步分析发现，大多数FRB出现在高局部恒星质量表面密度区域，与宿主星系的平均全局值相比显著升高。此外，四个宿主星系都有明显的螺旋臂特征，而从这些宿主星系发出的爆发往往出现在或靠近宿主的螺旋结构上。未来更多定位准确的FRB检测结果可能会更好地揭示FRB环境与宿主星系和其他瞬变类的特性。 <div>
We present observations from the Gemini Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics System/Gemini South Adaptive Optics Imager at Gemini South of five fast radio burst (FRB) host galaxies of FRBs with subarcsecond localizations. We examine and quantify the spatial distributions and locations of the FRBs with respect to their host galaxy light distributions, finding a median host-normalized offset of 2.09 half-light radii (re) and the trend that these FRBs occur in fainter regions of their host galaxies. When combined with the FRB host galaxy sample from Mannings et al., we find that FRBs are statistically distinct from Ca-rich transients in terms of light at the source location and from SGRBs and LGRBs in terms of host-normalized offset. We further find that most FRBs are in regions of elevated local stellar mass surface densities in comparison to the mean global values of their hosts. This, along with the finding that the FRB locations trace the distribution of stellar mass, points toward a possible similarity of the environments of CCSNe and FRBs. We also find that four out of five FRB hosts exhibit distinct spiral arm features, and the bursts originating from such hosts tend to appear on or close to their host’s spiral structure, with a median distance of 0.53 ± 0.27 kpc. With many well-localized FRB detections looming on the horizon, we will be able to better characterize the properties of FRB environments relative to their host galaxies and other transient classes. Such insights may only require us to double the number of FRBs with subarcsecond localizations.

<div> 关键词: 五百米口径球面射电望远镜，H i 21厘米辐射，Cloud-9，暗物质，星系。  
总结: 五百米口径球面射电望远镜最近在M94附近探测到H i 21厘米辐射，揭示了一个有趣的物体Cloud-9，它没有光学对应物。进一步分析表明Cloud-9与一个富含气体的暗物质晕（MH I ≈ 10^6M⊙，M200 ≈ 5 × 10^9M⊙）相一致。Karl G. Jansky超大阵的观测显示了Cloud-9的一些特征，表明它可能是一个星暗的ΛCDM暗物质晕。亚利安特望远镜（Hubble Space Telescope）的进一步观测将有助于确定Cloud-9是否是一个星系。Cloud-9可以说是迄今为止最坚实的无星暗物质晕候选者，或者是距离最远的已知最微弱的星系。 <br /><br /> <div>
Observations with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope recently detected H i 21 cm emission near M94, revealing an intriguing object, Cloud-9, without an optical counterpart. Subsequent analysis suggests that Cloud-9 is consistent with a gas-rich (MH I ≈ 106M⊙), starless, dark matter (DM) halo of mass M200 ≈ 5 × 109M⊙. Using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in D-array configuration, we present interferometric observations of Cloud-9, revealing it as a dynamically cold (W50 ≈ 12 km s−1), nonrotating, and spatially asymmetric system, exhibiting gas compression on one side and a tail-like structure toward the other—features likely originating from ram pressure. Our observations suggest Cloud-9 is consistent with a starless ΛCDM DM halo if the gas is largely isothermal. If interpreted as a faint dwarf, Cloud-9 is similar to Leo T, a nearby gas-rich galaxy that would fall below current optical detection limits at Cloud-9's distance (d ≈ 5 Mpc). Further observations with the Hubble Space Telescope reaching magnitudes mg ≈ 30 would help identify such a galaxy or dramatically lower the current limits on its stellar mass (Mgal ≲ 105M⊙). Cloud-9 thus stands as the firmest starless DM halo candidate to date or the faintest galaxy known at its distance.

这篇论文利用JWST的灵敏度和光谱覆盖能力，通过对四个晚期T和Y矮星的PRISM光谱进行分析，表明标准亚恒星大气模型难以复制4.1−4.4μm波长范围的特征。研究使用了基于Elf Owl化学和温度剖面的PICASO模型，并发现对于PH3和CO2的丰度存在数量级上的差异。由此推断，在UNCOVER−BD−3中所宣称的PH3检测可能可以用高于标准大气模型预测的CO2丰度来解释。但是，由于光谱的信噪比不够高，无法区分这两种情况。文章还讨论了解释观测到的PH3欠丰度和CO2过量的大气机制，包括垂直湍流扩散系数（Kzz）随高度变化、错误的化学途径以及元素以NH4H2PO4等形式凝结。作者认为，CO2增加的最佳解释是淬火近似不能准确预测CO2的丰度，因为CO在淬火后仍然与CO2保持化学平衡。 <br /><br />总结: 这篇论文使用JWST观测了晚期T和Y矮星的大气化学成分，发现标准大气模型难以复制观测结果，提出了CO2和PH3丰度不匹配的问题，并通过PICASO模型的拟合得出高于预期的CO2丰度。此外，还讨论了大气机制可能的解释。 <div>
The sensitivity and spectral coverage of JWST are enabling us to test our assumptions of ultracool dwarf atmospheric chemistry, especially with regards to the abundances of phosphine (PH3) and carbon dioxide (CO2). In this paper, we use Near Infrared Spectrograph PRISM spectra (∼0.8−5.5 μm, R ∼ 100) of four late T and Y dwarfs to show that standard substellar atmosphere models have difficulty replicating the 4.1−4.4 μm wavelength range, as they predict an overabundance of phosphine and an underabundance of carbon dioxide. To help quantify this discrepancy, we generate a grid of models using PICASO, based on the Elf Owl chemical and temperature profiles, where we include the abundances of these two molecules as parameters. The fits to these PICASO models show a consistent preference for orders-of-magnitude higher CO2 abundances and a reduction in PH3 abundance as compared to the nominal models. This tendency means that the claimed phosphine detection in UNCOVER−BD−3 could instead be explained by a CO2 abundance in excess of standard atmospheric model predictions; however, the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum is not high enough to discriminate between these cases. We discuss atmospheric mechanisms that could explain the observed underabundance of PH3 and overabundance of CO2, including a vertical eddy diffusion coefficient (Kzz) that varies with altitude, incorrect chemical pathways, or elements condensing out in forms such as NH4H2PO4. However, our favored explanation for the required CO2 enhancement is that the quench approximation does not accurately predict the CO2 abundance, as CO2 remains in chemical equilibrium with CO after CO quenches.

这篇文章利用Hilbert–Huang变换技术对新发现的BHXRB Swift J1727.8–1613中的LFQPO进行了相位分辨光谱学研究。研究揭示了非热和盘-黑体组分在QPO时间尺度上的变化，前者在QPO变异性中占据主导地位。对于光谱参数，我们观察到盘温度、光谱指数和反射分数随QPO相位的高统计学显着性（≳5σ）调制。值得注意的是，盘温度的变化发生在非热和盘流量变化之前，大约是∼0.4–0.5个QPO周期。我们认为这些发现进一步证明了C型QPO变异性是由于围绕着黑洞的吸积流的几何效应。 
<br /> <div>
Low-frequency quasiperiodic oscillations (LFQPOs) are commonly observed in X-ray light curves of black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs); however, their origin remains a topic of debate. In order to thoroughly investigate variations in spectral properties on the quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) timescale, we utilized the Hilbert–Huang transform technique to conduct phase-resolved spectroscopy across a broad energy band for LFQPOs in the newly discovered BHXRB Swift J1727.8–1613. This is achieved through quasi-simultaneous observations from Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer, Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, and Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope. Our analysis reveals that both the nonthermal and disk–blackbody components exhibit variations on the quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) timescale, with the former dominating the QPO variability. For the spectral parameters, we observe modulation of the disk temperature, spectral indices, and reflection fraction with the QPO phase with high statistical significance (≳5σ). Notably, the variation in the disk temperature is found to precede the variations in the nonthermal and disk fluxes by ∼0.4–0.5 QPO cycles. We suggest that these findings offer further evidence that the type-C QPO variability is a result of geometric effects of the accretion flow.

总结: 本文研究了Ia型超新星的形成机制，发现了一颗氦次矮星US 708以及七颗高速星，这支持了捐赠者是低质量氦星或白矮星的假设。通过水动力学模拟，发现在超新星爆发后，捐赠星会剥离大约0.01-0.02太阳质量的物质，并解释了剥离物在膨胀的超新星喷发中的位置。随后使用MESA模拟了受冲击的捐赠星的后爆炸演化，发现它们会保持明亮和膨胀约10^5-10^6年。最后发现氦白矮星的后爆炸性质与一个高速星D6-2相一致。 <div>
Type Ia supernovae arise from thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs accreting from a binary companion. Following the explosion, the surviving donor star leaves at roughly its orbital velocity. The discovery of the runaway helium subdwarf star US 708, and seven hypervelocity stars from Gaia data, all with spatial velocities ≳900 km s−1, strongly support a scenario in which the donor is a low-mass helium star or a white dwarf. Motivated by these discoveries, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with the Athena++ code, modeling the hydrodynamical interaction between a helium star or helium white dwarf and the supernova ejecta. We find that ≈0.01–0.02 M⊙ of donor material is stripped, and explain the location of the stripped material within the expanding supernova ejecta. We continue the postexplosion evolution of the shocked donor stars with the MESA code. As a result of entropy deposition, they remain luminous and expanded for ≈105–106 yr. We show that the postexplosion properties of our helium white dwarf donor agree reasonably with one of the best-studied hypervelocity stars, D6-2.

Coronal rain (CR) is a crucial part of the mass cycle between the corona and chromosphere. It includes flare-driven CR and two types of quiescent CR, along nonflaring active region closed loops and along open structures, separately, labeled as type I, type II, and type III CR, respectively. Among them, type I and type III CR are generally associated with magnetic reconnection. In this study, employing data taken by the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Solar Upper Transition Region Imager on 2022 October 11, we report three types of CR during an interchange reconnection between open and closed magnetic field structures above the southeastern solar limb. The open and closed structures converge, with the formation of the current sheet at the interface, and reconnect. The newly formed closed and open structures then recede from the reconnection region. During the reconnection, coronal condensation occurs along the reconnecting closed loops and falls toward the solar surface along both loop legs, as type II CR. Subsequently, condensation happens in the newly formed closed loops and moves down toward the solar surface along both loop legs, as type I CR. Magnetic dips of the reconnecting open structures form during the reconnection. In the dips, condensation occurs and propagates along the open structures toward the solar surface as type III CR. Our results suggest that the reconnection rate may be crucial for the formation of type I and type III CR during reconnection.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章使用了3D尘埃地图和Planck极化尘埃发射数据，研究了附近星际介质的3D几何形状对大尺度尘埃极化统计的影响。研究发现，极化尘埃发射所探测到的磁场趋向于局部泡泡壁，但并未发现局部泡泡几何形状对尘埃极化分数的影响。另外，研究还发现，当尘埃在不同距离上分布较多时，平均尘埃极化分数会下降；相反，当尘埃在3D空间中更集中时，尘埃极化分数会更高。在1.25千秒差距内，这一发现是具有统计显著性的，但如果只考虑270秒差距内的尘埃，则这一效应消失。最终研究得出结论，扩展的3D尘埃分布，而不仅仅是局部泡泡中的尘埃，对观测到的80′处的尘埃极化分数起到决定作用。 这一结论符合简单的分析预测，并在各种分析修改下保持稳健。这些结果揭示了星际介质的3D几何形状与星际磁场示踪剂之间的关系，对我们对宇宙微波背景极化尘埃前景的理解有重要意义。 <div>
Using 3D dust maps and Planck polarized dust emission data, we investigate the influence of the 3D geometry of the nearby interstellar medium (ISM) on the statistics of the dust polarization on large ( ) scales. We test recent models that assume that the magnetic field probed by the polarized dust emission is preferentially tangential to the Local Bubble wall, but we do not find an imprint of the Local Bubble geometry on the dust polarization fraction. We also test the hypothesis that the complexity of the 3D dust distribution drives some of the measured variation of the dust polarization fraction. We compare sight lines with similar total column densities and find that, on average, the dust polarization fraction decreases when the dust column is substantially distributed among multiple components at different distances. Conversely, the dust polarization fraction is higher for sight lines where the dust is more concentrated in 3D space. This finding is statistically significant for the dust within 1.25 kpc, but the effect disappears if we only consider dust within 270 pc. In conclusion, we find that the extended 3D dust distribution, rather than solely the dust associated with the Local Bubble, plays a role in determining the observed dust polarization fraction at 80′. This conclusion is consistent with a simple analytical prediction and remains robust under various modifications to the analysis. These results illuminate the relationship between the 3D geometry of the ISM and tracers of the interstellar magnetic field. We discuss implications for our understanding of the polarized dust foreground to the cosmic microwave background.

<title>PSR B0943+10: Mode Switch, Polar Cap Geometry, and Orthogonally Polarized Radiation</title>

<div> 关键词: PSR B0943+10, 脉冲星, 磁层动力学, 辐射几何, 单脉冲研究

总结:
脉冲星PSR B0943+10是研究脉冲星磁层动力学的典型范例，显示了模式切换、正交偏振和亚脉冲漂移等特征，研究频率通常在600MHz以下。本研究使用FAST在1.25 GHz高频率下进行综合和单脉冲研究，发现模式切换具有类似奇异吸引子的相空间演化模式。通过拟合偏振位置角和旋转矢量模型，提出了辐射几何学。此外，对B0943+10的正交极化辐射进行了详细研究，揭示了可能支持极化发射辐射传输模型的一些模式。Q模式的脉冲轮廓表明前驱和主脉冲组分具有正交极化，并可能来源于磁层不同深度。这些发现对脉冲星电动力学和相关辐射机制具有重要影响。 <div>
As one of the paradigm examples to probe into pulsar magnetospheric dynamics, PSR B0943+10 (J0946+0951) manifests representatively, showing a mode switch, orthogonal polarization, and subpulse drifting, frequently studied below 600 MHz. Here, both integrated and single pulses are studied at a high frequency (1.25 GHz) with FAST. The mode switch is studied using a profile decomposition method. A phase space evolution for the pulsar’s mode switch shows a strange-attractor-like pattern. The radiative geometry is proposed by fitting polarization position angles with the rotating vector model. The pulsar pulse profile is then mapped to the sparking locations on the pulsar surface, and the differences between the main pulse’s and the precursor component’s radiative processes may explain the X-ray’s synchronization with radio mode switch. Detailed single pulse studies on B0943+10's orthogonally polarized radiation are presented, which may support certain models of radiative transfer of polarized emission. In particular, the difference in orthogonal polarization modes’ circular polarization might reflect the cyclotron absorption in pulsar magnetospheres. B0943+10's B and Q modes evolve differently with frequency and have different proportions of orthogonal modes, which indicates possible magnetospheric changes during mode switch. For Q mode pulse profile, the precursor and the main pulse components are orthogonally polarized, and are probably originated from different depths in the magnetosphere. The findings could impact significantly on the pulsar electrodynamics and the radiative mechanism related.

<div> 关键词: Type Ia supernovae, delay-time distribution (DTD), chemical evolution models, Milky Way, stellar abundance distribution

总结:
Type Ia超新星在宇宙中产生了大部分的Fe峰元素，对星系化学演化模型至关重要。它们不会在恒星形成后立即爆炸，因此延迟时间分布（DTD）对化学演化模型中年龄、[Fe/H]和[α/Fe]之间的关系有重要影响。研究人员在多区域化学演化模型中实现了几种流行的DTD形式，并与银河系的多次星形成历史相结合。他们发现DTD对[α/Fe]分布有最大影响，符合更迅速的Type Ia超新星爆发DTD会产生偏向较低[α/Fe]比率的星际丰度分布。他们的模型结果支持DTD延长，具有较少的迅速Type Ia超新星，而不是经典的t−1幂律。这项研究对观测到的星际丰度轨迹、恒星丰度分布和恒星年龄分布进行了验证。 <br /><br /> <div>
Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) produce most of the Fe-peak elements in the Universe and therefore are a crucial ingredient in galactic chemical evolution models. SNe Ia do not explode immediately after star formation, and the delay-time distribution (DTD) has not been definitively determined by supernova surveys or theoretical models. Because the DTD also affects the relationship among age, [Fe/H], and [α/Fe] in chemical evolution models, comparison with observations of stars in the Milky Way is an important consistency check for any proposed DTD. We implement several popular forms of the DTD in combination with multiple star formation histories for the Milky Way in multizone chemical evolution models that include radial stellar migration. We compare our predicted interstellar medium abundance tracks, stellar abundance distributions, and stellar age distributions to the final data release of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment. We find that the DTD has the largest effect on the [α/Fe] distribution: a DTD with more prompt SNe Ia produces a stellar abundance distribution that is skewed toward a lower [α/Fe] ratio. While the DTD alone cannot explain the observed bimodality in the [α/Fe] distribution, in combination with an appropriate star formation history it affects the goodness of fit between the predicted and observed high-α sequence. Our model results favor an extended DTD with fewer prompt SNe Ia than the fiducial t−1 power law.

<title>Binary Mergers in the Centers of Galaxies: Synergy between Stellar Flybys and Tidal Fields</title>

<div> 关键词: Galactic centers, compact object binaries, tidal field, flyby interactions, merger rates
总结: 本文研究了星系中心环境中紧密天体双星的演化和并合率，首次重点关注星团潮汐场和飞越相互作用的综合效应。研究发现，这两种过程之间存在显著的协同作用，使得并合率相较于仅考虑飞越或潮汐的模型增加了约10-30倍。这种协同作用的结果是潮汐驱动的近似离心率激励受到飞越所推动的jz扩散的增强。并合效率在扩散速率大约比潮汐驱动扭矩速率慢10-100倍时达到峰值。此外，逐渐软化的双星也能解除最初紧密双星的相对论耗散作用，从而扩大了并合的相空间。综上所述，尽管飞越导致双星逐渐软化，但它们通过促进潮汐场驱动的离心率激发，大大增加了星系中心的并合率。 <br /><br /> <div>
Galactic centers (GCs) are very dynamically active environments, often harboring a nuclear star cluster and supermassive black hole at their cores. Binaries in these environments are subject to strong tidal fields that can efficiently torque its orbit, exciting near-unity eccentricities that ultimately lead to their merger. In turn, frequent close interactions with passing stars impulsively perturb the orbit of the binary, generally softening their orbit until their evaporation, potentially hindering the role of tides to drive these mergers. In this work, we study the evolution of compact object binaries in the GC and their merger rates, focusing for the first time on the combined effect of the cluster’s tidal field and flyby interactions. We find a significant synergy between both processes, where merger rates increase by a factor of ∼10−30 compared to models in which only flybys or tides are taken into account. This synergy is a consequence of the persistent tides-driven eccentricity excitation that is enhanced by the gradual diffusion of jz driven by flybys. The merger efficiency peaks when the diffusion rate is ∼10−100 slower than the tides-driven torquing. Added to this synergy, we also find that the gradual softening of the binary can lift the relativistic quenching of initially tight binaries, otherwise unable to reach extreme eccentricities, and thus expanding the available phase space for mergers. Cumulatively, we conclude that despite the gradual softening of binaries due to flybys, these greatly enhance their merger rates in GCs by promoting the tidal-field-driven eccentricity excitation.

A rare population of massive disk-dominated quiescent galaxies has recently drawn much attention, which intrudes the red sequence (RS) population without destroying the underlying stellar disks. In this study, we have carefully identified 48 RS, disk-dominated galaxies with M* > 1010M⊙ between redshift 0.5 and 1.0 in all five CANDELS fields. These galaxies are well fitted by a two-component bulge plus disk model, and have the bulge-to-total ratio B/T < 0.4 in the both F814W and F160W bands. The fitting results indicate that these galaxies generally have extended stellar disks (∼3 kpc on average) and tiny bulge components (∼0.5 kpc on average). To understand their possible origins, we have also selected two control samples of 156 green valley (GV) and 309 blue cloud (BC) disk-dominated galaxies according to the same selection criteria. We study the UVI(U − V versus V − I) color gradients of these galaxies to infer their specific star formation rate (sSFR) gradients out to the maximum acceptable radii. We show that on average the disks in disk-dominated RS galaxies are fully quenched at all radii, whereas both the BC and GV disks are not fully quenched at any radii. We find that all the BC, GV, and RS disk galaxies generally have nearly flat sSFR profiles. We propose a potential formation mechanism, acknowledging that various other mechanisms (e.g., central compaction and active galactic nucleus feedback) might contribute, where massive quiescent disk-dominated galaxies are predominantly formed via a process of secular disk fading.

As both Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO) reach heliocentric distances closer to the Sun, they present an exciting opportunity to study the structure of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the inner heliosphere. We present an analysis of the global flux rope structure of the 2022 September 5 CME event that impacted PSP at a heliocentric distance of only 0.07 au and SolO at 0.69 au. We compare in situ measurements at PSP and SolO to determine global and local expansion measures, finding a good agreement between magnetic field relationships with heliocentric distance, but significant differences with respect to flux rope size. We use PSP/Wide-Field Imager for Solar Probe images as input to the ELlipse Evolution model based on Heliospheric Imager data (or ELEvoHI), providing a direct link between remote and in situ observations; we find a large discrepancy between the resulting modeled arrival times, suggesting that the underlying model assumptions may not be suitable when using data obtained close to the Sun, where the drag regime is markedly different in comparison to larger heliocentric distances. Finally, we fit the SolO's magnetometer and PSP's FIELDS data independently with the 3D Coronal ROpe Ejection (or 3DCORE) model, and find that many parameters are consistent between spacecraft. However, challenges are apparent when reconstructing a global 3D structure that aligns with arrival times at PSP and SolO, likely due to the large radial and longitudinal separations between spacecraft. From our model results, it is clear the solar wind background speed and drag regime strongly affect the modeled expansion and propagation of CMEs and need to be taken into consideration.

磁层太阳大气中是否携带中性电流存在争议，本研究通过对28个喷发磁通绳的磁场和电流进行研究，确认了在同一磁通绳的对应磁场点之间不存在显著差异，并证实了通过日冕变暗来识别磁通绳的方法的有效性。研究还发现，携带大量净电流的磁通绳与产生喷发前变暗有中等程度的关联，这可以通过电流通道的洛伦兹自力作用来解释。测试还表明，在估计磁通绳的磁扭曲时，必须考虑电流密度和磁场的空间不均匀分布。 <div>
It is under debate whether the magnetic field in the solar atmosphere carries neutralized electric currents, in particular, whether a magnetic flux rope (MFR), which is considered the core structure of coronal mass ejections, carries neutralized electric currents. Recently Wang et al. (2023) studied magnetic flux and electric current measured at the footpoints of 28 eruptive MFRs from 2010 to 2015. Because of the small sample size, no rigorous statistical analysis has been done. Here, we include nine more events from 2016 to 2023 and perform a series of nonparametric statistical tests at a significance level of 5%. The tests confirm that there exist no significant differences in magnetic properties between conjugated footpoints of the same MFR, which justifies the method of identifying the MFR footpoints through coronal dimming. The tests demonstrate that there exist no significant differences between MFRs with preeruption dimming and those with only posteruption dimming. However, there is a medium level of association between MFRs carrying substantial net current and those producing preeruption dimming, which can be understood by the Lorentz self-force of the current channel. The tests also suggest that in estimating the magnetic twist of MFRs, it is necessary to take into account the spatially inhomogeneous distribution of electric current density and magnetic field.

We present JWST/NIRSpec high-resolution G395H/F290LP spectroscopy of MACS0647−JD, a gravitationally lensed galaxy merger at z = 10.167.

This is the first observation of the resolved [O ii] λλ3726, 3729 doublet for a galaxy at z > 8. We measure a line flux ratio [O ii] λ3729/λ3726 = 0.9 ± 0.3, which corresponds to an estimated electron density of . This is significantly higher than the electron densities of local galaxies reported in the literature. We compile measurements from the literature and further analyze the redshift evolution of ne. We find that the redshift evolution follows the power-law form of ne = A × (1 + z)p with cm−3 and . This power-law form may be explained by a combination of metallicity and morphological evolution of galaxies, which become, on average, more metal poor and more compact with increasing redshift.

Neutral atomic hydrogen and molecular gas in the host galaxies of radio active galactic nuclei can be traced using H i 21 cm and OH-1667 MHz absorption lines to understand the fueling and feedback processes. We present the results of an H i and OH absorption survey with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope toward 40 radio sources of low–intermediate radio luminosity (∼1023–1026 W Hz−1 at 1.4 GHz), red mid-infrared color (W2[4.6 μm]–W3[12 μm] > 2.5 mag), and redshift up to 0.35. From 13 sources with good data at H i observing frequencies, we report the detection of H i absorption toward eight sources, five of which are new detections, including four in the redshift range 0.25–0.35. Our detection rates are consistent with our previous results, with the dependence on the star formation history of the host galaxies reflected in the mid-infrared Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer W2−W3 colors and the compactness of the radio sources. We find no significant dependence of the detection rates on radio luminosity or redshift. We also find that the H i column densities are anticorrelated with the low-frequency spectral indices ( , Sν ∝ ν−α). We do not have any detections from 23 sources with good data at OH observing frequencies. However, by stacking the spectra, we estimate the 3σ upper limit of the OH column density to be 2.27 × 1014Tex/10 K × 1/fc cm−2. By stacking the OH spectra for seven associated H i absorbers, we get a 3σ upper limit of 3.47 × 1014Tex/10 K × 1/fc cm−2 on the OH column density and 1.78 × 10−7 on the [OH]/[H i] ratio.

The charge exchange between the interstellar medium and the solar wind plasma is crucial for determining the structures of the heliosphere. Since both the neutral-ion and neutral–neutral collision mean free paths are either comparable to or larger than the size of the heliosphere, the neutral phase space distribution can deviate far away from the Maxwellian distribution. A kinetic description for the neutrals is crucial for accurately modeling the heliosphere. It is computationally challenging to run three-dimensional time-dependent kinetic simulations due to the large number of macroparticles. In this paper, we present the new highly efficient Solar Wind with Hydrogen Ion Exchange and Large-scale Dynamics-2 model with a kinetic model of neutrals and a magnetohydrodynamic model for the ions and electrons. To improve the simulation efficiency, we implement adaptive mesh refinement and particle splitting and merging algorithms for the neutral particles to reduce the particle number that is required for an accurate simulation. We present several tests to verify and demonstrate the capabilities of the model.

这篇文章中进行了一个三维的广义相对论辐射磁流体动力学模拟，模拟了一个倾斜的超艾丁顿吸积盘环绕自转黑洞的情况。盘会倾斜和扭曲，并在维持形状的同时进动。气体主要是在外部盘环绕的自转轴向外喷射，而不是在黑洞的自转轴向外喷射。盘的进动会随时间改变气体的喷射方向。辐射能量也在大致相同的方向释放，所以进动会导致观测到的光度产生准周期的时间变化。对于10太阳质量的黑洞和数十个引力半径范围内的盘径，进动的时间尺度约为10秒。这个时间尺度与一些超强X射线源观测到的低频准周期振荡（0.01-1赫兹）的频率是一致的。

We perform a three-dimensional general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulation of a tilted super-Eddington accretion disk around a spinning black hole (BH). The disk, which tilts and twists as it approaches the BH, precesses while maintaining its shape. The gas is mainly ejected around the rotation axis of the outer part of the disk rather than around the spin axis of the BH. The disk precession changes the ejection direction of the gas with time. The radiation energy is also released in approximately the same direction as the outflow, so the precession is expected to cause a quasiperiodic time variation of the observed luminosity. The timescale of the precession is about 10 s for a 10 M⊙ BH and for the radial extent of a disk of several tens of gravitational radii, where M⊙ is the solar mass. This timescale is consistent with the frequency of the low-frequency quasiperiodic oscillation (0.01–1 Hz) observed in some ultraluminous X-ray sources.

红巨星HD 49385内存在小尺度磁场的研究取得了突破，研究人员通过引入修正的Eddington T-τ方程，模拟了磁场对恒星大气中振荡的影响，并推断出磁场约80G的强度，高度约1850km。研究人员还通过将计算频率与观测频率进行对比，选择了两个最佳模型，确认了避免交叉模式与恒星的氦核密切相关，并确定了HD 49385的质量为1.25M⊙，年龄分别为4.1Gyr和4.5Gyr。这些结果提供了关于HD 49385内部结构和恒星参数的重要信息。<br /><br /> <div>
Recent asteroseismic studies have shown convincing evidence that magnetic fields may exist in the interior of some pulsating red giants. Inspired by this breakthrough, we explored the effect of small-scale magnetic fields on the p-mode oscillations in an evolved star, HD 49385. We incorporate a modified Eddington T–τ equation that phenomenologically mimics the effect of the magnetic fields in the atmosphere of HD 49385, and calculate the frequencies of p-modes with l = 0, 1, and 2. By comparing the calculated frequencies with the observed ones, we select two best-fit models with either GS98 or A09 chemical composition. Our best-fit models not only fit satisfactorily the observed frequencies but also well reproduce some spectroscopically observed stellar parameters such as effective temperature and log g. Based on the two best-fit models, we have estimated that the small-scale magnetic fields possess a strength of approximately 80 G and spread concentratively at approximately a height of 1850 km in the atmosphere. By selecting the best-fit models with a special requirement on the avoided-crossing mode, we have confirmed that the frequency of the avoided-crossing mode is tightly related to the helium core of the star, and determined the size of the helium core as 0.117 M⊙ in mass and 0.078 R⊙ in radius. Based on the improvements of the previous two sides, we can accurately determine the mass of HD 49385 to be 1.25 ± 0.02 M⊙ with an age of 4.1 Gyr for GS98 composition and 4.5 Gyr for A09 composition.

<div> 关键词: 反馈、星际介质、星系、星形成率、巨分子云
总结:
本研究使用第二代FIRE-2模拟框架，通过终止反馈来研究其对银河质量星系的影响。结果显示，终止反馈导致星际湍流速度下降，密集物质增加，星形成率增加超过一个数量级。此外，研究发现，反馈对巨分子云的影响也表现在多个方面，包括新的束缚云的增多，松散云的湍流支撑减少，云的密度整体增加以及内部星形成的激增。此外，通过计算云集成的星形成率，发现现有的湍流调控理论对于星形成率的激增预测存在至少3倍的低估。综上所述，该研究表明星系中的星形成受到反馈调控，而星际介质对巨分子云的影响也是多方面的。 <div>
Stellar feedback influences the star formation rate (SFR) and the interstellar medium of galaxies in ways that are difficult to quantify numerically, because feedback is an essential ingredient of realistic simulations. To overcome this, we conduct a feedback-halting experiment starting with a Milky Way–mass galaxy in the second-generation Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) simulation framework. By terminating feedback, and comparing to a simulation in which feedback is maintained, we monitor how the runs diverge. We find that without feedback, the interstellar turbulent velocities decay. There is a marked increase of dense material, while the SFR increases by over an order of magnitude. Importantly, this SFR boost is a factor of ∼15–20 larger than is accounted for by the increased freefall rate caused by higher densities. This implies that feedback moderates the star formation efficiency per freefall time more directly than simply through the density distribution. To probe changes at the scale of giant molecular clouds (GMCs), we identify GMCs using density and virial parameter thresholds, tracking clouds as the galaxy evolves. Halting feedback stimulates rapid changes, including a proliferation of new bound clouds, a decrease of turbulent support in loosely bound clouds, an overall increase in cloud densities, and a surge of internal star formation. Computing the cloud-integrated SFR using several theories of turbulence regulation, we show that these theories underpredict the surge in SFR by at least a factor of 3. We conclude that galactic star formation is essentially feedback regulated on scales that include GMCs, and that stellar feedback affects GMCs in multiple ways.

本文研究了首个脉动超亮X射线源M82 X-2正在经历快速轨道衰变，提出了异常磁制动模型来解释观测到的轨道衰变。研究指出，如果捐赠星是一个具有异常强磁场的Ap/Bp星，那么表面磁场与来自捐赠星表面的辐射驱动风之间的磁耦合可能导致有效的角动量损失，从而驱动观测到的M82 X-2的快速轨道衰变。除此之外，研究还讨论了其他潜在的模型，包括伴星膨胀和周围的环双星盘。总结: 本文提出了异常磁制动模型来解释M82 X-2的轨道衰变，并探讨了其他可能的模型。 <div>
Recently, the first pulsating ultraluminous X-ray source M82 X-2 was reported to be experiencing a rapid orbital decay at a rate of based on 7 yr NuSTAR data. To account for the observed orbital-period derivative, it requires a mass transfer rate of ( is the Eddington accretion rate) from the donor star to the accreting neutron star. However, other potential models cannot be completely excluded. In this work, we propose an anomalous magnetic braking (AMB) model to interpret the detected orbital decay of M82 X-2. If the donor star is an Ap/Bp star with an anomalously strong magnetic field, the magnetic coupling between strong surface magnetic field and irradiation-driven wind from the surface of the donor star could cause an efficient angular-momentum loss, driving a rapid orbital decay observed in M82 X-2. The AMB mechanism of an Ap/Bp star with a mass of 5.0–15.0 M⊙ and a surface magnetic field of 3000–4500 G could produce the observed of M82 X-2. We also discuss the possibility of other alternative models including the companion star expansion and a surrounding circumbinary disk.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章报道了利用JWST的中红外仪器中分辨率光谱仪在中红外波长发现的预主序物体喷流。喷流仅在[Ni ii]、[Fe ii]、[Ar ii]和[Ne ii]线中观察到。H2发射以完全不同的形态呈现，呈现出围绕喷流轴对称分布的宽角双锥形状。ALMA的观测解析出在双中红外喷流起源处处于边缘的两个相邻边视吸积盘。假设正在研究的年轻多重系统的各成分同时发育，该系统的年龄至少为（2-2.5）× 106年，尽管边视盘源的能谱能量分布所推断的年龄有明显较年轻的矛盾。ALMA的CO（2−1）、13CO（2−1）和C18O（2−1）观测显示没有分子流或残余腔壁的痕迹。因此，观察到的H2结构必须起源于宽角盘风，而没有任何环境中被扫除的气体。在最近对原恒星的研究背景下，我们提出了一个流出演变情景，其中分子气体组件在最年轻的源中占主导地位，而快速离子喷流在最老的源中占主导地位，就像在WL 20系统中发现的双喷流一样。 <div>
We report the discovery of jets emanating from pre-main-sequence objects exclusively at mid-infrared wavelengths, enabled by the superb sensitivity of JWST’s Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium-Resolution Spectrometer. These jets are observed only in lines of [Ni ii], [Fe ii], [Ar ii], and [Ne ii]. The H2 emission, imaged in eight distinct transitions, has a completely different morphology, exhibiting a wide-angled, biconical shape, symmetrically distributed about the jet axes. Synergistic high-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations resolve a pair of side-by-side edge-on accretion disks lying at the origin of the twin mid-infrared jets. Assuming coevality of the components of the young multiple system under investigation, the system age is at least (2–2.5) × 106 yr, despite the discrepantly younger age inferred from the spectral energy distribution of the combined edge-on disk sources. The later system evolutionary stage is corroborated by ALMA observations of CO(2−1), 13CO(2−1), and C18O(2−1), which show no traces of molecular outflows or remnant cavity walls. Consequently, the observed H2 structures must have their origins in wide-angled disk winds, in the absence of any ambient, swept-up gas. In the context of recent studies of protostars, we propose an outflow evolutionary scenario in which the molecular gas component dominates in the youngest sources, whereas the fast, ionized jets dominate in the oldest sources, as is the case for the twin jets discovered in the WL 20 system.

The information regarding how the intergalactic medium is reionized by astrophysical sources is contained in the tomographic three-dimensional 21 cm images from the epoch of reionization. In Zhao et al. (“Paper I”), we demonstrated for the first time that density estimation likelihood-free inference (DELFI) can be applied efficiently to perform a Bayesian inference of the reionization parameters from the 21 cm images. Nevertheless, the 3D image data needs to be compressed into informative summaries as the input of DELFI by, e.g., a trained 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) as in Paper I (DELFI-3D CNN). Here in this paper, we introduce an alternative data compressor, the solid harmonic wavelet scattering transform (WST), which has a similar, yet fixed (i.e., no training), architecture to CNN, but we show that this approach (i.e., solid harmonic WST with DELFI) outperforms earlier analyses based on 3D 21 cm images using DELFI-3D CNN in terms of credible regions of parameters. Realistic effects, including thermal noise and residual foreground after removal, are also applied to the mock observations from the Square Kilometre Array. We show that under the same inference strategy using DELFI, the 21 cm image analysis with solid harmonic WST outperforms the 21 cm power spectrum analysis. This research serves as a proof of concept, demonstrating the potential to harness the strengths of WST and simulation-based inference to derive insights from future 21 cm light-cone image data.

Continuous wavelet analysis is gaining popularity in science and engineering for its ability to analyze data across both spatial and scale domains simultaneously. In this study, we introduce a wavelet-based method for halo identification and assess its feasibility in two-dimensional (2D) scenarios. We begin by generating four pseudo-2D data sets from the SIMBA dark matter simulation by compressing thin slices of three-dimensional (3D) data into 2D. Subsequently, we calculate the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) directly from the particle distributions, identify local maxima that represent actual halos, and segment the CWT to delineate halo boundaries. A comparison with the traditional friends-of-friends (FOF) method shows that while our CWT-identified halos contain slightly fewer particles, they have smoother boundaries and are more compact in dense regions. In contrast, the CWT method can link particles over greater distances to form halos in sparse regions due to its spatial segmentation scheme. The spatial distribution and halo power spectrum of both CWT and FOF halos demonstrate substantial consistency, validating the 2D applicability of CWT for halo detection. While our identification scheme has been tested solely in a limited 2D context and has shown some performance limitations, its linear time complexity of and consistency with the FOF method suggest its suitability for analyzing significantly larger data sets in the future and its potential to be extended to the 3D case.

The λ21 cm H i emission that is used to trace the gas-to-dust ratio at high Galactic latitudes has contributions from material beyond the Milky Way disk, with uncertain and likely subsolar metallicity and dust content. These contributions can be isolated kinematically and their presence is clear for sightlines with small mean reddening 〈E(B − V)〉 ≲ 0.03 mag, which have mean ratios 〈N(H i)〉/〈E(B − V)〉 that are 20%–50% above the high-latitude Galactic average 〈N(H i)〉/〈E(B − V)〉 = 8.3 × 1021 cm−2 mag−1. By mapping N(H i) and E(B − V) across H i high-velocity cloud complexes and the Magellanic Clouds, we show that the reddening of this kinematically isolated gas is on average 5 times smaller per H i than the high-latitude average. However, the aggregate contribution of this gas is small and 〈N(H i)〉/〈E(B − V)〉 = 8.3 × 1021 cm−2 mag−1 is the appropriate value for Galactic gas seen at high latitude using the H i and reddening measures employed here and in our previous work.

这篇文章介绍了使用哈勃空间望远镜对小麦哲伦星云核心的88颗Cepheid变星进行相位校正的光度测量，将其纳入了与之前测量的Cepheid变星在SH0ES距离梯度上相同的光度系统中。研究限制在内核区域，并对其几何特性进行建模，以减少由于该云的非平凡深度而导致的误差。得到了前所未有的低离散度值为0.102等 mag 的 P-L 关系。通过对15个晚期分离的SMC双星的新几何距离的测量，将星系标示的数量从三个增加到了四个。将SMC纳入到距离梯度中，得到的H0 = 73.17 ± 0.86 km s^-1 Mpc^-1。该基于Cepheid和Ia型超新星的本地H0测量与基于ΛCDM宇宙学的宇宙微波背景得出的值存在5.8σ的张力，加强了ΛCDM以外的物理可能性。 <div>
We present phase-corrected photometric measurements of 88 Cepheid variables in the core of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), the first sample obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) Wide Field Camera 3, in the same homogeneous photometric system as past measurements of all Cepheids on the SH0ES distance ladder. We limit the sample to the inner core and model the geometry to reduce errors in prior studies due to the nontrivial depth of this cloud. Without crowding present in ground-based studies, we obtain an unprecedentedly low dispersion of 0.102 mag for a period–luminosity (P–L) relation in the SMC, approaching the width of the Cepheid instability strip. The new geometric distance to 15 late-type detached eclipsing binaries in the SMC offers a rare opportunity to improve the foundation of the distance ladder, increasing the number of calibrating galaxies from three to four. With the SMC as the only anchor, we find H0 = 74.1 ± 2.1 km s−1 Mpc−1. Combining these four geometric distances with our HST photometry of SMC Cepheids, we obtain H0 = 73.17 ± 0.86 km s−1 Mpc−1. By including the SMC in the distance ladder, we also double the range where the metallicity ([Fe/H]) dependence of the Cepheid P–L relation can be calibrated, and we find γ = −0.234 ± 0.052 mag dex−1. Our local measurement of H0 based on Cepheids and Type Ia supernovae shows a 5.8σ tension with the value inferred from the cosmic microwave background assuming a Lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmology, reinforcing the possibility of physics beyond ΛCDM.

Solar differential rotation exhibits a prominent feature: its cyclic variations over the solar cycle, referred to as zonal flows or torsional oscillations, are observed throughout the convection zone. Given the challenge of measuring magnetic fields in subsurface layers, understanding deep torsional oscillations becomes pivotal in deciphering the underlying solar dynamo mechanism. In this study, we address the critical question of identifying specific signatures within helioseismic frequency-splitting data associated with the torsional oscillations. To achieve this, a comprehensive forward modeling approach is employed to simulate the helioseismic data for a dynamo model that, to some extent, reproduces solar-cycle variations of magnetic fields and flows. We provide a comprehensive derivation of the forward modeling process utilizing generalized spherical harmonics, as it involves intricate algebraic computations. All estimated frequency-splitting coefficients from the model display an 11 yr periodicity. Using the simulated splitting coefficients and realistic noise, we show that it is possible to identify the dynamo wave signal present in the solar zonal flow from the tachocline to the solar surface. By analyzing observed data, we find similar dynamo wave patterns in the observational data from the Michelson Doppler Imager, Helioseismic Magnetic Imager, and Global Oscillation Network Group. This validates the earlier detection of dynamo waves and holds potential implications for the solar dynamo theory models.

The formation and evolution of spiral arms in low surface brightness galaxies (LSBs) are not well understood. We study the dynamics of spiral arms in two prototypical LSBs, FGC 568-VI and FGC 568-01, using both analytical models and N-body + hydrodynamical simulations. We first consider the disk as a two-component system of gravitationally coupled stars and gas in the force field of a spherical dark matter halo, subjected to local, nonaxisymmetric perturbations. However, no local spirals are formed. We next assume the disk to be a one-component system of stars in the net gravitational potential of a galaxy with a spherical dark matter halo perturbed by a global m = 2 instability. In this case, the growth time for spiral formation was low, equal to 0.78 and 0.96 Gyr, respectively, corresponding to a few dynamical times of the galaxies. Finally, we simulate the LSBs using the N-body + hydrodynamical simulation code RAMSES. Our results show that a quadrupolar field associated with an oblate halo with an axial ratio of 0.7 is necessary to drive a long-lived global spiral in the LSB disks. Further, feedback corresponding to a supernova mass fraction of ∼0.05 is essential to comply with the observed stellar surface density. The simulated spirals survive for about 10 dynamical times and the average pattern speed lies between 10 and 15 km s−1 kpc−1. The spiral arms thus formed are therefore a transient global pattern driven by the tidal field of the oblate dark matter halo.

With the aid of high-resolution spatial and temporal observations from the Goode Solar Telescope, we present an investigation of the emergence, coalescence, and submergence of a moving magnetic feature (MMF) in the region surrounding a magnetic pore located at the periphery of a large sunspot. The results show that the MMF has a magnetic field strength greater than 500 G and is dominated by the horizontal magnetic component. We observe upflow at the inner part and downflow at the outer part, indicating a pattern of Evershed flow. The MMF emergence is accompanied by the expansion of a granule, which has several striations inside just like the twisted features found in the penumbra filament. Our analysis shows that although these striations have different properties of magnetic field and kinematics during the expansion of the granule, the overall magnetic and dynamic properties of the MMF remain stable. We find that the region where the MMF emerges and submerges becomes more penumbra-like, i.e., adjacent positive and negative values of elongated magnetic features that are parallel to each other, while the optical penumbra-like features are not apparent at the same time. Our work indicates that the dynamics of the MMF near the magnetic pore is important for the development of filamentary structure. The magnetic configuration produced by an MMF together with the elongation of a granule could thus be key to understand the formation of penumbra filaments.

该研究对K2-18这颗M红矮星进行了高分辨率光谱分析，发现其托管了一颗位于宜居带的次海王星型外行星。研究介绍了一种准确归一化观测光谱的技术，并引入了一个新的自动逐行模型拟合代码AutoSpecFit，用于测量冷矮星的元素丰度。该团队应用此代码于K2-18星，并测量了10种元素（C、O、Na、Mg、Al、K、Ca、Sc、Ti和Fe）的丰度，发现除Fe外，其丰度均略高于太阳丰度。然而，受不确定的恒星参数系统误差限制了推断丰度的准确性。研究还推导了与几种行星构建元素相关的丰度比，如Al/Mg、Ca/Mg、Fe/Mg和一个类似太阳的C/O比率，即0.568±0.026。另外，K2-18 b行星的大气成分已经引起了极大关注，早期JWST研究揭示了其异常的化学性质。未来JWST对K2-18 b的分析结果将与其母星的化学丰度进行比较，以提供关于该行星系统形成的基本见解。 <br /><br />总结: 高分辨率光谱分析显示K2-18红矮星托管了一颗位于宜居带的次海王星型外行星；研究引入了AutoSpecFit代码，测量了该星的多种元素丰度，并推导了与行星构建元素相关的丰度比；K2-18 b行星的大气化学性质异常，JWST测量结果将与母星的化学丰度进行比较，以提供该行星系统形成的基本见解。 <div>
We present an in-depth, high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of the M dwarf K2-18, which hosts a sub-Neptune exoplanet in its habitable zone. We show our technique to accurately normalize the observed spectrum, which is crucial for a proper spectral fitting. We also introduce a new automatic, line-by-line, model-fitting code, AutoSpecFit, which performs an iterative χ2 minimization process to measure individual elemental abundances of cool dwarfs. We apply this code to the star K2-18, and measure the abundance of 10 elements: C, O, Na, Mg, Al, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, and Fe. We find these abundances to be moderately supersolar, except for Fe, with a slightly subsolar abundance. The accuracy of the inferred abundances is limited by the systematic errors due to uncertain stellar parameters. We also derive the abundance ratios associated with several planet-building elements such as Al/Mg, Ca/Mg, Fe/Mg, and (a solar-like) C/O = 0.568 ± 0.026, which can be used to constrain the chemical composition and the formation location of the exoplanet. On the other hand, the planet K2-18 b has attracted considerable interest, given the JWST measurements of its atmospheric composition. Early JWST studies reveal an unusual chemistry for the atmosphere of this planet, which is unlikely to be driven by formation in a disk of unusual composition. The comparison between the chemical abundances of K2-18 b from future JWST analyses and those of the host star can provide fundamental insights into the formation of this planetary system.

<div> 关键词: 极化观测, 脉冲星, 模式转换, 结果模型, 偏振分数

总结:
极化观测显示，射电脉冲星的极化矢量位置角度会出现突然转变，伴随着偏振矢量的椭圆度角度大幅变化，表明矢量经过了Poincaré球的右或左圆极点附近。这些角度的行为可以通过正交极化模式的支配权的转变或者相位差变化导致的矢量旋转来解释。研究了四种极化模型以量化和理解在模式转换时角度的行为。结果表明，模型的结果可能相似，表示在特定模型背景下对观测到的转变的解释并不唯一。发射的极化分数和平均椭圆度角取决于模式强度波动的统计特性。偏振分数随着波动的增加而增加。当模式强度近似稳定时，椭圆度角的变化会很大，而当强度波动较大时则会被抑制。 <div>
Polarization observations of radio pulsars show that abrupt transitions in the polarization vector’s position angle can be accompanied by large excursions in the vector’s ellipticity angle, suggesting the vector passes near the right or left circular pole of the Poincaré sphere. The behavior of the angles can be explained by a transition in dominance of the orthogonal polarization modes or a vector rotation caused by a change in the phase difference between the modes. Four polarization models are examined to quantify and understand the behavior of the angles at a mode transition: coherent polarization modes, partially coherent modes, incoherent modes with nonorthogonal polarization vectors, and incoherent orthogonal modes with an elliptically polarized emission component. In all four models, the trajectory of the mode transition on the Poincaré sphere follows the geodesic that connects the orientations of the mode polarization vectors. The results from the models can be similar, indicating that the interpretation of an observed transition within the context of a particular model is not necessarily unique. The polarization fraction of the emission and the average ellipticity angle depend upon the statistical character of the mode intensity fluctuations. The polarization fraction increases as the fluctuations increase. The excursion in ellipticity angle can be large when the mode intensities are quasi-stable and is suppressed when the intensity fluctuations are large.

Turbulent diffuse molecular clouds can exhibit complicated morphologies caused by the interactions among radiation, chemistry, fluids, and fields. We performed full 3D simulations for turbulent diffuse molecular interstellar media, featuring time-dependent nonequilibrium thermochemistry coevolved with magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Simulation results exhibit the relative abundances of key chemical species (e.g., C, CO, OH) vary by more than one order of magnitude for the “premature” epoch of chemical evolution (t ≲ 2 × 105 yr). Various simulations are also conducted to study the impacts of physical parameters. Nonideal MHD effects are essential in shaping the behavior of gases, and strong magnetic fields (∼10 μG) tend to inhibit vigorous compressions and thus reduce the fraction of warm gases (T ≳ 102 K). Thermodynamical and chemical conditions of the gas are sensitive to modulation by dynamic conditions, especially the energy injection by turbulence. Chemical features, including ionization (cosmic ray and diffuse interstellar radiation), would not directly affect the turbulence power spectra. Nonetheless, their effects are prominent in the distribution profiles of temperatures and gas densities. Comprehensive observations are necessary and useful to eliminate the degeneracies of physical parameters and constrain the properties of diffuse molecular clouds with confidence.

An enhancement in the activity of the early young Sun resulting in a high charged particle flux has been invoked to explain excesses in spallation-induced nuclides in primitive planetary materials. Astronomical observations of energetic outbursts of young stellar objects (YSOs) also support the idea of an active young Sun. However, the early solar cosmic-ray (SCR) flux has not been well constrained. Here we use measured concentrations of SCR-produced nuclides that formed and are preserved in meteoritical hibonite and spinel, some of the solar system’s oldest solids, and physical models for dust transport in the early protoplanetary disk to determine the magnitude of the early SCR flux. We focus our attention on cosmogenic neon, which cannot have been inherited from precursors and can only be produced in situ in solids. Our modeled effective exposure time to SCRs for these solids is very short, on the order of years. This indicates that the young Sun’s SCR flux recorded in refractory mineral hibonite was up to ∼7 orders of magnitude higher than the contemporary level. Our flux estimate is consistent with the >105× enhanced flux inferred from astronomical observations of greatly enhanced flare activities of YSOs.

<br />主序星在中等光谱类型的中转时，从缓慢旋转（较冷的恒星）向快速旋转（较热的恒星）转变，这一转变被称为克拉夫特断裂，归因于外对流包层的消失，导致磁制动变得无效。研究汇总了405颗距离为33.33 pc的F型恒星的光谱测量数据。在剔除了年轻、进化和候选双星后，投影旋转速度的分布表明断裂是明确定义并相对明显的。几乎所有红于GBP − GRP = 0.60 mag的恒星都是缓慢旋转的（vsini ≲20 km s−1），而比GBP − GRP = 0.54 mag更蓝的32颗恒星中只有4颗是缓慢旋转的，与随机倾斜分布的预期一致。断裂点位于有效温度为6550 K处，宽度约为200 K，相当于1.32–1.41 M⊙的质量范围。断裂点比热木星显示出倾斜分布变化的恒星温度高约450 K，后者通常被归因于潮汐重新定位。上述定义的断裂点在大约650百万年的昴星团中几乎但并非完全建立；它应在1亿年以上的星团中确立。我们建议，克拉夫特断裂为所谓的低质量恒星和中质量恒星之间提供了更有用的划分，无论从专业或教学的目的来看，克拉夫特断裂都有明确的观测定义，并与恒星结构的变化有关。<br /><br />总结: 主序星在中等光谱类型的中转时，从缓慢旋转（较冷的恒星）向快速旋转（较热的恒星）转变，这一转变被称为克拉夫特断裂。在特定的有效温度和质量范围内，这一断裂点是明确定义的。克拉夫特断裂提供了一个更有用的划分，可以用于区分低质量恒星和中质量恒星，并与恒星结构的变化有关。 <div>
Main-sequence stars transition at mid-F spectral types from slowly rotating (cooler stars) to rapidly rotating (hotter stars), a transition known as the Kraft Break and attributed to the disappearance of the outer convective envelope, causing magnetic braking to become ineffective. To define this Break more precisely, we assembled spectroscopic measurements of 405 F stars within 33.33 pc. Once young, evolved, and candidate binary stars are removed, the distribution of projected rotational velocities shows the Break to be well defined and relatively sharp. Nearly all stars redder than GBP − GRP = 0.60 mag are slowly rotating (vsini ≲20 km s−1), while only 4 of 32 stars bluer than GBP − GRP = 0.54 mag are slowly rotating, consistent with that expected for a random distribution of inclinations. The Break is centered at an effective temperature of 6550 K and has a width of about 200 K, corresponding to a mass range of 1.32–1.41 M⊙. The Break is ∼450 K hotter than the stellar temperature at which hot Jupiters show a change in their obliquity distribution, often attributed to tidal realignment. The Break, as defined above, is nearly but not fully established in the ∼650 Myr Hyades cluster; it should be established in populations older than 1 Gyr. We propose that the Kraft Break provides a more useful division, for both professional and pedagogical purposes, between what are called low-mass stars and intermediate-mass stars; the Kraft Break is observationally well defined and is linked to a change in stellar structure.

恒星形成星系和非恒星形成星系都有反转的恒星盘结构。通过DESI g、r、z彩色图像不显示星系合并的迹象，暗示了气体吸积是形成反转恒星盘的动力源。对恒星速度场的可见反转，可以确定内外两个主要恒星盘的边界。在恒星形成星系的内区，恒星和电离气体是共转的，并且恒星群是较年轻的。比较内外两个区域的恒星形成主序关系显示出内区域的增强恒星形成活动。而在非恒星形成星系的外区，恒星和电离气体也是共转的，恒星群也是较年轻的。比较内外两个区域的恒星质量-金属丰度关系表明了外区域的气体相对富含金属。考虑到非恒星形成星系中较为不充分的既有气体，外部吸积的气体可以保存角动量，从而促进了外区域的恒星形成。总的来说，气体吸积对恒星形成星系和非恒星形成星系的演化产生了不同的影响。 <div>
Using integral field spectroscopic data from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory survey, we investigate the spatially resolved properties and empirical relations of a star-forming galaxy and a non-star-forming galaxy hosting counterrotating stellar disks (CRDs). The DESI g, r, z color images reveal no evidence of merger remnants in either galaxy, suggesting that gas accretion fuels the formation of CRDs. Based on the visible counterrotation in the stellar velocity field, we can fit a spatial boundary to distinguish the inner and outer regions dominated by two stellar disks in each galaxy. In the inner region of the star-forming CRDs, stars are corotating with ionized gas, and the stellar population is younger. Comparison of the star-forming main-sequence relations between the inner and outer regions reveals enhanced star formation in the inner region. Given the abundant preexisting gas in the star-forming galaxy, collisions between preexisting and external gas efficiently consume angular momentum, triggering star formation in the inner region. Conversely, in the outer region of the non-star-forming CRDs, stars are corotating with ionized gas, and the stellar population is younger. Comparison of the stellar mass–metallicity relations between the inner and outer regions indicates enriched gas-phase metallicity in the outer region. Considering the less abundant preexisting gas in the non-star-forming galaxy, external gas could preserve angular momentum, fueling star formation in the outer region. Overall, gas accretion exhibits different influences on the evolution of star-forming and non-star-forming galaxies.

总结: <br />
本研究提出了一个新的参数化透镜模型，用于G165.7+67.0星系团。通过Planck发现了这个星系团，其亮子毫米通量来自一对非同寻常的尘埃星系形成星系(DSFGs)，它们的红移约为2.2。通过JWST和干涉毫米/射电观测，我们表征了DSFGs的内在物理性质，它们在源平面上仅相隔约1″(8千秒差距)，速度差ΔV ≲ 600 km s−1，因此可能正在经历一次重要的合并。拥有内在星形成速率SFRIR = 320 ± 70和400 ± 80 M⊙ yr−1，恒星质量为10.3 ± 0.1，尘埃衰减为AV = 1.5 ± 0.3和1.2 ± 0.3，它们是非常相似的天体。我们使用JWST/NIRCam的近似UV至近IR成像进行像素级别的空间分辨光谱能量分布(SED)拟合，解析了一些恒星结构，达到100光差距的尺度。基于其解析的比星形成速率(SFRs)和UVJ颜色，两个DSFGs都正在经历重大的星系规模的星形成事件。如果它们确实在引力上相互作用，这种强烈的星暴可能是气体已经被初次接近的通道破坏的标志。相比之下，SN H0pe的宿主星系其SFR比DSFGs低得多，并且我们呈现了在低比星形成速率区域内内向外熄灭和大尘埃柱密度的证据。基于从UV到远红外SED建模推断的DSFGs的内在SFRs，单单这对物体预计每年将产生可观测的1.1 ± 0.2个核心坍缩超新星，使得该星团领域适合持续监测。 <div>
We present a new parametric lens model for the G165.7+67.0 galaxy cluster, which was discovered with Planck through its bright submillimeter flux, originating from a pair of extraordinary dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at z ≈ 2.2. Using JWST and interferometric mm/radio observations, we characterize the intrinsic physical properties of the DSFGs, which are separated by only ∼1″ (8 kpc) and a velocity difference ΔV ≲ 600 km s−1 in the source plane, and thus are likely undergoing a major merger. Boasting intrinsic star formation rates SFRIR = 320 ± 70 and 400 ± 80 M⊙ yr−1, stellar masses of and 10.3 ± 0.1, and dust attenuations of AV = 1.5 ± 0.3 and 1.2 ± 0.3, they are remarkably similar objects. We perform spatially resolved pixel-by-pixel spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using rest-frame near-UV to near-IR imaging from JWST/NIRCam for both galaxies, resolving some stellar structures down to 100 pc scales. Based on their resolved specific star formation rates (SFRs) and UVJ colors, both DSFGs are experiencing significant galaxy-scale star formation events. If they are indeed interacting gravitationally, this strong starburst could be the hallmark of gas that has been disrupted by an initial close passage. In contrast, the host galaxy of SN H0pe has a much lower SFR than the DSFGs, and we present evidence for the onset of inside-out quenching and large column densities of dust even in regions of low specific SFR. Based on the intrinsic SFRs of the DSFGs inferred from UV through far-infrared SED modeling, this pair of objects alone is predicted to yield an observable 1.1 ± 0.2 core-collapse supernovae per year, making this cluster field ripe for continued monitoring.

<div> 磁场波动，行星间空间，太阳风，湍流，频率-波数谱模型

总结:<br /><br />本文研究了通过Voyager航天器在行星间空间中测量的磁场波动。研究发现，由于太阳风速度变得次音速并且慢于快磁音速，标准的Taylor假设不再适用。为了解决这一问题，引入了一个4D频率-波数谱模型以分解不同的波模式。研究考虑了各种波模式，包括等离子体阿尔文模式、快磁模式和通过三流体理论得到的两种色散快磁波模式。研究发现，内部行星间空间的磁场波动并不像之前认为的那样压缩，而具有大约25%的可压缩波动能量。同时，热揽收离子和相对较冷的太阳风离子在垂直传播限制下引起了两种色散快磁波模式，其中揽收离子快波可能解释了可观测频谱中质子旋频率附近的谱凸起。最后，研究指出湍流波数谱可能并非Kolmogorov样式，而是依赖于各种波模式之间的功率分配，这种分配可能随着波数的变化而改变。 <div>
Magnetic field fluctuations measured in the heliosheath by the Voyager spacecraft are often characterized as compressible, as indicated by a strong fluctuating component parallel to the mean magnetic field. However, the interpretation of the turbulence data faces the caveat that the standard Taylor’s hypothesis is invalid because the solar wind flow velocity in the heliosheath becomes subsonic and slower than the fast magnetosonic speed, given the contributions from hot pickup ions (PUIs) in the heliosheath. We attempt to overcome this caveat by introducing a 4D frequency-wavenumber spectral modeling of turbulence, which is essentially a decomposition of different wave modes following their respective dispersion relations. Isotropic Alfvén and fast mode turbulence are considered to represent the heliosheath fluctuations. We also include two dispersive fast wave modes derived from a three-fluid theory. We find that (1) magnetic fluctuations in the inner heliosheath are less compressible than previously thought, an isotropic turbulence spectral model with about 25% in compressible fluctuation power is consistent with the observed magnetic compressibility in the heliosheath; (2) the hot PUI component and the relatively cold solar wind ions induce two dispersive fast magnetosonic wave branches in the perpendicular propagation limit, PUI fast wave may account for the spectral bump near the proton gyrofrequency in the observable spectrum; (3) it is possible that the turbulence wavenumber spectrum is not Kolmogorov-like although the observed frequency spectrum has a −5/3 power-law index, depending on the partitioning of power among the various wave modes, and this partitioning may change with wavenumber.

在这项研究中，我们进行了包括宇宙射线传输（CRT）的星团形成的数值模拟。我们发现，在类似银河系的环境中，宇宙射线在主要的星形成时期对云的离子化率影响有限。然而，在高宇宙射线环境中，云中的宇宙射线分布升高，导致云的较早坍缩和星形成效率增加约50％至约13％。初始质量函数在所有情况下都相似，但在高宇宙射线环境中可能会有变化。需要进一步的研究来解释观察到的分子云中的离子化率范围，并探索极端宇宙射线环境中的星形成情况。
<br /><br />总结： <div>
Cosmic rays (CRs) are the primary driver of ionization in star-forming molecular clouds (MCs). Despite their potential impacts on gas dynamics and chemistry, no simulations of star cluster formation following the creation of individual stars have included explicit cosmic-ray transport (CRT) to date. We conduct the first numerical simulations following the collapse of a 2000M⊙ MC and the subsequent star formation including CRT using the STAR FORmation in Gaseous Environments framework implemented in the GIZMO code. We show that when CRT is streaming-dominated, the CR energy in the cloud is strongly attenuated due to energy losses from the streaming instability. Consequently, in a Milky Way–like environment the median CR ionization rate in the cloud is low (ζ ≲ 2 × 10−19 s−1) during the main star-forming epoch of the calculation and the impact of CRs on the star formation in the cloud is limited. However, in high-CR environments, the CR distribution in the cloud is elevated (ζ ≲ 6 × 10−18), and the relatively higher CR pressure outside the cloud causes slightly earlier cloud collapse and increases the star formation efficiency by 50% to ∼13%. The initial mass function is similar in all cases except with possible variations in a high-CR environment. Further studies are needed to explain the range of ionization rates observed in MCs and explore star formation in extreme CR environments.

We report the identification of 15 galaxy candidates at z ≥ 9 using the initial COSMOS-Web JWST observations over 77 arcmin2 through four Near Infrared Camera filters (F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W) with an overlap with the Mid-Infrared Imager (F770W) of 8.7 arcmin2.

These galaxies are, on average, more luminous than most z ≥ 9 candidates discovered by JWST so far in the literature, while exhibiting similar blue colors in their rest-frame UV. The rest-frame UV slopes derived from SED fitting are blue (β ∼ [−2.0, −2.7]) without reaching extremely blue values as reported in other recent studies at these redshifts. The blue color is consistent with models that suggest the underlying stellar population is not yet fully enriched in metals like similarly luminous galaxies in the lower-redshift Universe. The derived stellar masses with M⋆/M⊙)〉 ≈ 8–9 are not in tension with the standard Lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM) model, and our measurement of the volume density of such UV-luminous galaxies aligns well with previously measured values presented in the literature at z ∼ 9–10. Our sample of galaxies, although compact, is significantly resolved.

<div> 关键词: 光子解耦, 相对论性喷流, 光谱演化, 辐射, 光学深度<br />
总结: 本文研究了在脉冲中发生的光谱演化，并跟踪了辐射从深次光球区域到观测到的时间分辨信号的过程，考虑了不同角度和半径处的辐射。在高光学深度下，我们发现辐射存在三种特征区域，其中两种表现出高能量的幂律。根据注入的特性，这种幂律可以持续到低光学深度，在脉冲的上升期间表现出一个谱指数β≈α−1，其中α是低能谱指数。该研究结果是在伽玛射线暴喷流的背景下给出的，但对光学厚、相对论性的喷流是普遍适用的。<br /> <div>
Photons that decouple from a relativistic jet do so over a range of radii, leading to a spreading in arrival times at the observer. Therefore, changes to the comoving photon distribution across the decoupling zone are encoded in the emitted signal. In this paper, we study such spectral evolution occurring across a pulse. We track the radiation from the deep subphotospheric regions all the way to the observed time-resolved signal, accounting for emission at various angles and radii. We assume a simple power-law photon spectrum injection over a range of optical depths and let the photons interact with the local plasma. At high optical depths, we find that the radiation exists in one of three characteristic regimes, two of which exhibit a high-energy power law. Depending on the nature of the injection, this power law can persist to low optical depths and manifest itself during the rise time of the pulse with a spectral index β ≈ α − 1, where α is the low-energy spectral index. The results are given in the context of a gamma-ray burst jet, but are general to optically thick, relativistic outflows.

<div> 关键词: 能谱, 激波加速, 粒子输运, 非线性输运, 磁场扰动
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了行星际激波加速粒子的观测能谱与理论预测之间的不匹配问题。研究发现，在某些情况下，粒子通量在广泛能量范围内形成一个高原，延伸到激波上游长达七个通量倍数，然后消失在背景谱中。此外，在激波处和下游，粒子通量按能量的倒数下降，与激波加速理论的预测一致。这表明了一种与传统激波加速模型中的粒子输运机制不同的现象。研究者对激波加速理论进行了修改，包括引入粒子扩散率与粒子通量的依赖关系（非线性输运）以及磁场扰动的作用。这些修改使得模型能够解释观测到的上游高原能谱现象。他们还推测，除了时间相关性之外，上游能谱的非单调空间变化可能还来自于非激波加速机制的作用，例如随机费米加速或磁泵加速。 <div>
The observed energy spectra of accelerated particles at interplanetary shocks often do not match the diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) theory predictions. In some cases, the particle flux forms a plateau over a wide range of energies, extending upstream of the shock for up to seven flux e-folds before submerging into the background spectrum. Remarkably, at and downstream of the shock we have studied in detail, the flux falls off in energy as ϵ−1, consistent with the DSA prediction for a strong shock. The upstream plateau suggests a particle transport mechanism different from those traditionally employed in DSA models. We show that a standard (linear) DSA solution based on a widely accepted diffusive particle transport with an underlying resonant wave–particle interaction is inconsistent with the plateau in the particle flux. To resolve this contradiction, we modify the DSA theory in two ways. First, we include a dependence of the particle diffusivity κ on the particle flux F (nonlinear particle transport). Second, we invoke short-scale magnetic perturbations that are self-consistently generated by, but not resonant with, accelerated particles. They lead to the particle diffusivity increasing with the particle energy as ∝ϵ3/2 that simultaneously decreases with the particle flux as 1/F. The combination of these two trends results in the flat spectrum upstream. We speculate that nonmonotonic spatial variations of the upstream spectrum, apart from being time-dependent, may also result from non-DSA acceleration mechanisms at work upstream, such as stochastic Fermi or magnetic pumping acceleration.

总结: 本文报告了在太阳冠中电流片动态变薄过程中，通过三维磁流体力学模拟首次观测到磁重连接通过撕裂不稳定性开始的初始结果。在所有模拟中，非线性撕裂不稳定性的发生都要在不稳定增长时间比动态变薄时间更快之后才会出现，进而导致电流片的破裂。此外，与之前对太阳冠静态电流片的三维磁流体力学模拟结果相似，对于一些参数来说，磁场的剪切程度是一个重要的开关参数，这对于太阳冠加热模型有重要意义。这些结果可能为利用可观测的太阳冠电流片的数量来预测它们何时会破裂并释放磁能以驱动各种活跃现象和/或加热大气层提供了可能。 <div>
We present the first results of three-dimensional (3D) numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the onset of magnetic reconnection via the tearing instability in dynamically thinning current sheets in the solar corona. In all our simulations, the onset of the nonlinear tearing instability, which leads to the breakup of the thinning current sheet, does not occur until after the instability growth time becomes faster than the dynamic thinning time. Furthermore, as in previous 3D MHD simulations of static current sheets in the corona, for some parameters the amount of magnetic shear is a fundamental switch-on parameter, which has consequences for coronal heating models. These results open up the possibility of using observable quantities of coronal current sheets to predict when they will break up and release magnetic energy to power various energetic phenomena and/or heat the atmosphere.

Circularly polarized waves consistent with parallel-propagating ion cyclotron waves (ICWs) and fast magnetosonic waves (FMWs) are often observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) at ion kinetic scales. Such waves damp energy via cyclotron resonance, and cyclotron damping is expected to play a significant role in the enhanced, anisotropic heating of the solar wind observed in the inner heliosphere. We employ a linear plasma dispersion solver, PLUME, to evaluate the frequencies of ICWs and FMWs in the plasma rest frame and Doppler-shift them to the spacecraft frame, calculating their damping rates at frequencies where persistently high values of circular polarization are observed. We find that such ion-scale waves are observed during 20.37% of PSP Encounters 1 and 2 observations and their plasma frame frequencies are consistent with them being transient ICWs. We estimate significant ICW dissipation onto protons, consistent with previous empirical estimates for the total turbulent damping rates, indicating that ICW dissipation could account for the observed enhancements in the proton temperature and its anisotropy with respect to the mean magnetic field.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用Parkes Murriyang射电望远镜的超宽带低频接收机进行了三颗黑寡妇蜘蛛毫秒脉冲星（BW MSPs）的轨道相位依赖分析，旨在调查日食环境中的磁场。观测到了J0024−7204J，J1431−4715和J1959+2048三个BW MSPs的脉冲辐射在日食相位出现了去极化现象，与其他BW MSPs的先前研究结果一致。我们估计了这些MSPs的轨道相位依赖旋转测量值。宽带观测还为这些BW MSPs的日食截止频率提供了限制。对于J0024−7204J，我们报告了日食截止频率的时间变化，并伴随观察到的六次日食中电子柱密度的变化。此外，对于J1431−4715，确定了1251±80 MHz的截止频率，得出了电子在日食过程中的主要吸收机制为同步辐射。此外，对于J1959+2048，估计的截止频率超过了1400 MHz，与先前的研究结果一致。通过这项调查，我们将具有轨道相位分辨率研究的BW MSPs样本数量增加了一倍，从而更好地探测了日食环境。 <div>
This study presents an orbital-phase-dependent analysis of three black widow spider millisecond pulsars (BW MSPs), aiming to investigate the magnetic field within the eclipse environment. The ultrawide-bandwidth low-frequency receiver of the Parkes Murriyang radio telescope is utilized for full polarization observations covering frequencies from 704−4032 MHz. Depolarization of pulsed emission is observed during the eclipse phase of three BW MSPs, namely PSR J0024−7204J, PSR J1431−4715, and PSR J1959+2048, consistent with previous studies of other BW MSPs. We estimated orbital-phase-dependent rotation measure values for these MSPs. The wide bandwidth observations also provided constraints on the eclipse cutoff frequency for these BW MSPs. For PSR J0024−7204J, we report temporal variation of the eclipse cutoff frequency coupled with changes in the electron column density within the eclipse medium across six observed eclipses. Moreover, the eclipse cutoff frequency for PSR J1431−4715 is determined to be 1251 ± 80 MHz, leading to the conclusion that synchrotron absorption is the primary mechanism responsible for the eclipsing. Additionally, for PSR J1959+2048, the estimated cutoff frequency exceeded 1400 MHz, consistent with previous studies. With this investigation, we have doubled the sample size of BW MSPs with orbital-phase-resolved studies, allowing a better probe of the eclipse environment.

We present an analytical and numerical study of a system composed of a stellar binary pair and a massless, locally isothermal viscous accretion disk that is coplanar to the binary orbital plane. Analytically, we study the effect of the binary’s gravitational potential over short timescales through the stability of epicyclic orbits, and over long timescales by revisiting the concept of resonant torques. Numerically, we perform two-dimensional Newtonian simulations of the disk-binary system over a range of binary mass ratios. We find that the results of our simulations are consistent with those of previous numerical studies. We additionally show, by comparison of the analytical and numerical results, that the circumbinary gap is maintained on the orbital timescale through the driving of epicyclic instabilities, and does not depend on resonant torquing, contrary to the standard lore. While our results are applicable to any disk-binary system, we highlight the importance of this result in the search for electromagnetic and gravitational-wave signatures from supermassive black hole binaries.

本文讨论了HCN + H−反应作为形成CN−的途径，以及在数个星际环境中观察到的最小的氰多炔负离子。首先通过完整的5D表示得到了新的从头算反应势能面，其中只保持C-N键不变，讨论了用于得到动力学精确拟合的神经网络程序。然后利用准经典轨迹方法研究了反应在暗分子云的低温范围内的情况，并将计算扩展到室温以成功地与现有的实验数据进行比较。我们进一步介绍了反应的降维建模，将其作为包含长程力的2D过渡态处理，并讨论了这些力在产生大的反应速率系数方面的主导作用，这两种处理方法得到的反应速率系数在50至300K温度范围内的大小和行为非常相似。我们讨论了这些结果对于CN−物种在星际介质中通过这种化学途径形成的影响，并建议它相对于最近计算得到的辐射电子附着途径的速率系数来说更为重要，后者的速率系数小得多。 <div>
We discuss the HCN + H− reaction as a path to the formation of CN−, the smallest cyanopolyyne anion observed in several interstellar environments. We first obtain the new ab initio reactive potential energy surface using a full 5D representation, where only the C–N bond is kept fixed, and discuss the neural network procedure employed to yield an accurate fit for the dynamics. The reaction is then investigated by using a quasi-classical trajectory approach to scan the low-temperature range of the dark molecular clouds where the anion has been sighted. Calculations are extended to room temperature to make a successful comparison with existing experimental data. We further present reduced dimensionality modeling of the reaction as a 2D process within a variational-transition state treatment with the inclusion of long-range forces. The dominant role of such forces in producing large reaction rate coefficients is discussed for both treatments, which yield very similar sizes and behavior of such coefficients from 50 to 300 K. The implications of our results for the interstellar medium formation of the CN− species via this chemical route are discussed, suggesting its greater significance over the radiative electron attachment paths, whose rate coefficients were found by recent calculations to be orders of magnitude smaller.

总结: 
本研究更新了17个THINGS星系的H i表面密度测量，通过解决原始Very Large Array (VLA) H i图像的短间距问题。更新基于将原始THINGS VLA H i图像与FEASTS项目中FAST单天线接收器拍摄的H i图像相结合。在外部盘中，H i表面密度的中位数增量为0.15–0.4 dex。一些星系的径向剖面H i表面密度发生显著变化，七个星系的H i尺寸-质量关系现在低于1σ。更新了外部盘中的H i星形成定律，H i表面密度和星形成速率表面密度的中位数关系下移约0.15 dex，散射显著增加。星形成效率的散射与恒星质量面密度的相关性更强。因此，探测到以前由于Very Large Array观测的短间距问题而未能检测到的弥散H i对于揭示由外部盘的局部环境中可能受到星际反馈调节的星际物质的真实状态和变化很重要。 <div>
We update the H i surface density measurements for a subset of 17 THINGS galaxies by dealing with the short-spacing problem of the original Very Large Array (VLA) H i images. It is the same sample that Bigiel et al. used to study the relation between H i surface densities and star formation (SF) rate surface densities in galaxy outer disks, which are beyond the optical radius r25. For 10 galaxies, the update is based on combining original THINGS VLA H i images with H i images taken by the single-dish FAST in the FEASTS program. The median increment of H i surface densities in outer disks is 0.15–0.4 dex at a given new H i surface density. Several galaxies change significantly in the shape of radial profiles H i surface densities, and seven galaxies are now more than 1σ below the H i size–mass relation. We update the H i star formation laws in outer disks. The median relation between the H i surface densities and SF rate surface densities based on pixel-wise measurements shifts downward by around 0.15 dex because the H i surface density values shift rightward, and the scatter increases significantly. The scatter of the relation, indicating the star-forming efficiency, exhibits a much stronger positive correlation with the stellar mass surface density than before. Thus, detecting the previously missed, diffuse H i due to the short-spacing problem of the Very Large Array observations is important in revealing the true condition and variation in SF possibly regulated by stellar feedbacks in the localized environment of outer disks.

Interaction between supernova (SN) ejecta and dense circumstellar medium (CSM) with a flat density structure (ρ ∝ r−s, s < 1.5) was recently proposed as a possible mechanism behind interacting SNe that exhibit exceptionally long rise times exceeding 100 days. In such a configuration, the interaction luminosity keeps rising until the reverse shock propagates into the inner layers of the SN ejecta. We investigate the light curves of SNe interacting with a flatly distributed CSM in detail, incorporating the effects of photon diffusion inside the CSM into the model. We show that three physical processes—the shock breakout, the propagation of the reverse shock into the inner ejecta, and the departure of the shock from the dense CSM—predominantly determine the qualitative behavior of the light curves. Based on the presence and precedence of these processes, the light curves of SNe interacting with flatly distributed CSM can be classified into five distinct morphological classes. We also show that our model can qualitatively reproduce doubly peaked SNe whose peaks are a few tens of days apart, such as SN 2005bf and SN 2022xxf. Our results show that the density distribution of the CSM is an important property of CSM that contributes to the diversity in light curves of interacting SNe.

Remote sensing observations by Hayabusa2 and laboratory measurements have revealed that the phyllosilicates on asteroid (162173) Ryugu are dehydrated/dehydroxylated due to space weathering. Reactive molecular dynamics simulations were performed to evaluate the magnitude of the dehydroxylation of Mg-rich serpentine by micrometeoroid impacts. When micrometeoroids were not coupled with interplanetary magnetic fields, serpentine could be dehydroxylated by micrometeoroids as small as 2 nm in size. In particular, ∼200 O–H bonds dissociated when the meteoroids were derived from cometary activity (the impact velocity was ∼20 km s−1). When nano-sized dust particles were accelerated to ∼300 km s−1 by the magnetic fields of solar wind plasma, the number of dissociated O–H bonds increased by 1 order of magnitude. Consequently, even 1 nm-sized dust particles can contribute to the space weathering of Ryugu. In all cases, Si–OH, H2O, and free OH were generated from the hydroxyls initially connected to Mg, which could partially offset dehydration. Despite the limitations of our computational resources, which restricted the simulation timescale to 1 ps, reactive molecular dynamic simulations demonstrated that micrometeoroid bombardment could influence the space weathering of asteroids.

在过去几十年中，近百万个类星体被研究，以阐明超大质量黑洞和星系的演化过程。其中，一型类星体的紫外至光学光谱特别能够揭示它们的黑洞活动情况。然而，最近的发现引发了对红色一型类星体普遍性的质疑，它们的颜色可能是由于尘埃遮挡，并且可能影响类星体的光度相关特性。本文研究了红移范围为0.68 ≤ z < 2.20的一型类星体中红色类星体的比例，应用了斯隆数字化巡天数据第14版的光学至中红外光度数据进行光谱能量分布拟合。大约10%的一型类星体呈现红色，暗示存在尘埃遮挡。我们发现中红外光度与红色一型类星体的比例存在关联，尽管红移进化较小。通过使用SED拟合得到的E(B−V)值，我们获得了红色一型类星体的消光光度，重新评估了类星体光度函数（QLF）和黑洞质量（MBH）的估计。结果显示明亮类星体的数量密度适度增加，与QLF的明亮端坡度更加平缓相关，而MBH的调整则很小。目前的SDSS选择与光学颜色可能忽略了大量严重遮挡的类星体。随着未来MIR（中红外）调查的扩展，如“宇宙历史、再电离时期和冰冰探索者的光谱光度计”，它们可能会揭示足够多的遮挡类星体，促使对基本类星体特性进行更深入的修订。

Over the past decades, nearly a million quasars have been explored to shed light on the evolution of supermassive black holes and galaxies. The ultraviolet-to-optical spectra of type-1 quasars particularly offer insights into their black hole activities. Recent findings, however, raise questions about the prevalence of red type-1 quasars of which colors might be due to dust obscuration and their potential influence on luminosity-related properties of quasars. We examine the fraction of red type-1 quasars within the redshift range of 0.68 ≤ z < 2.20, applying a spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using optical-to-mid-infrared (MIR) photometric data of Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 14 quasars. Approximately 10% of the type-1 quasars exhibit red colors suggestive of dust obscuration. There is an association between the brightness of the MIR luminosity and a higher fraction of red type-1 quasars, albeit with negligible redshift evolution. By employing E(B − V) values from the SED fitting, we obtained dereddened luminosity of the red type-1 quasars and reassess the quasar luminosity function (QLF) and black hole mass (MBH) estimates. Result shows a modest increase in the number density of bright quasars, linking to more flatten bright-end slope of QLFs, while MBH adjustments are minimal. Current SDSS selections with optical colors could miss a significant population of heavily dust-obscured quasars. As future MIR surveys like Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer expand, they may reveal enough obscured quasars to prompt a more profound revision of fundamental quasar properties.

这篇文章介绍了使用SPT-3G进行的三项调查，覆盖了分别深度为1500、2650和6000 deg2的不同区域，总共观测了25%的天空。调查结果显示，在2024年底，将以大约2.5、9和-armin的宇宙微波背景(CMB)温度单位在150 GHz进行观测。此外，调查还包括了95和220 GHz的测量数据。作者采用了一种新方法获取了联合和最优估计的引力透镜势带功率和未透镜CMB温度和极化带功率的协方差矩阵。研究表明，SPT-3G数据对ΛCDM模型的cosmological参数通常具有约2倍更小的不确定性，相比之下Planck测量的角尺度和极化水平有很大的不同，这为标准cosmological模型提供了额外的测试。通过SPT-3G和Planck数据的联合分析，还可以考虑对ΛCDM拓展参数的约束改进。 <br /><br />总结: 本文介绍了SPT-3G进行的三项调查，说明了对cosmological参数的约束与Planck数据相比有显著改进，同时还可以对ΛCDM模型进行额外的测试。 <div>
We forecast constraints on cosmological parameters enabled by three surveys conducted with SPT-3G, the third-generation camera on the South Pole Telescope. The surveys cover separate regions of 1500, 2650, and 6000 deg2 to different depths, in total observing 25% of the sky. These regions will be measured to white noise levels of roughly 2.5, 9, and -armin, respectively, in cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature units at 150 GHz by the end of 2024. The survey also includes measurements at 95 and 220 GHz, which have noise levels a factor of ∼1.2 and 3.5 times higher than 150 GHz, respectively, with each band having a polarization noise level times higher than the temperature noise. We use a novel approach to obtain the covariance matrices for jointly and optimally estimated gravitational lensing potential band powers and unlensed CMB temperature and polarization band powers. We demonstrate the ability to test the ΛCDM model via the consistency of cosmological parameters constrained independently from SPT-3G and Planck data, and consider the improvement in constraints on ΛCDM extension parameters from a joint analysis of SPT-3G and Planck data. The ΛCDM cosmological parameters are typically constrained with uncertainties up to ∼2 times smaller with SPT-3G data, compared to Planck, with the two data sets measuring significantly different angular scales and polarization levels, providing additional tests of the standard cosmological model.

<title>Rotation of Polarization Angle in Gamma-Ray Burst Prompt Phase. II. The Influence of the Parameters</title>

<div> 关键词: 光变曲线, 能谱, 极化, 旋转, 磁重联<br />
<br />总结:
本研究使用磁重联模型研究了伽马射线暴（GRB）的偏振角旋转对光变曲线和能谱推断的影响。发现喷流的半张角θj、观测角θV和洛伦兹因子Γ对偏振角旋转有显著影响，且受到θjΓ0乘积值影响，与具体数值关系不大。对于典型参数，偏离轴的观测变化范围在T90内的偏振角变化△PA为（12°，66°）。当θjΓ0 > 50且1.0 < q ≤ 1.2时，最显著的PA旋转将发生，△PA约为90°。 <div>
In addition to the light curve and energy spectrum, polarization is also important for inferring the physical properties of the gamma-ray burst (GRB). Rotation of the polarization angle (PA) with time will cause depolarization of the time-integrated polarization degree. However, it has rarely been studied before. Here, we use a magnetic reconnection model with a large-scale ordered aligned magnetic field in the emitting region to study the influence of the parameters on the PA rotations in the GRB prompt phase. We find that the half-opening angle of the jet θj, the observational angle θV, and the bulk Lorentz factor Γ all have significant impacts on the PA rotations. The PA rotations are affected by the product value of θjΓ0 (Γ0 is the normalization factor of Γ with ), but are roughly independent of the concrete values of both θj and Γ0. For the typical parameters, the changes of the PA within T90 (△PA) would be within (12°, 66°) for slight off-axis observations, where T90 is the duration of the burst with the accumulated flux density ranging from 5% to 95%. The q range for △PA > 10° becomes smaller with the increase of the product value of θjΓ0. The most significant PA rotation with △PA ∼ 90° will happen when θjΓ0 > 50 and 1.0 < q ≤ 1.2.

Summary:
LHS 6343系统由一个已解析的M-矮星双星系统和一个演化的棕矮星LHS 6343 C组成，棕矮星在主星周围轨道运转。通过使用高斯差分模糊算法，观测到了二次星食现象，进而获得了近红外发射光谱，匹配到了T1.5 ± 1的光谱类型。使用ATMO-2020、Sonora-Bobcat和BT-Settl模型网格进行大气特性的表征，并结合观测和模型化的光谱能量分布，推断出LHS 6343 C的视亮度为log(Lbol/L☉) = −4.77 ± 0.03，有效温度为1303 ± 29 K。同时利用ATMO-2020和Sonora-Bobcat演化模型网格推断了LHS 6343 C的年龄。 <br /><br />总结: LHS 6343系统包括M矮星双星和棕矮星LHS 6343 C，通过观测到的二次星食现象获得了近红外发射光谱，并进行了大气特性的表征。用观测和模型化的光谱能量分布推断出LHS 6343 C的视亮度和有效温度。同时，通过演化模型网格推断了LHS 6343 C的年龄。 <div>
The LHS 6343 system consists of a resolved M-dwarf binary with an evolved, negligibly irradiated brown dwarf (BD), LHS 6343 C, orbiting the primary star. Such BD eclipsing binaries present rare and unique opportunities to calibrate substellar evolutionary and atmosphere models since mass, radius, temperature, and luminosity can be directly measured. We update this BD’s mass (62.6 ± 2.2 MJup) and radius (0.788 ± 0.043 RJup) using empirical stellar relations and a Gaia Data Release 3 distance. We use Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) observations of an LHS 6343 C secondary eclipse to obtain a near-IR emission spectrum, which matches to a spectral type of T1.5 ± 1. We combine this spectrum with existing Kepler and Spitzer/IRAC secondary-eclipse photometry to perform atmospheric characterization using the ATMO-2020, Sonora-Bobcat, and BT-Settl model grids. ATMO-2020 models with strong nonequilibrium chemistry yield the best fit to observations across all modeled bandpasses while predicting physical parameters consistent with Gaia-dependent analogs. BT-Settl predicts values slightly more consistent with such analogs but offers a significantly poorer fit to the WFC3 spectrum. Finally, we obtain a semi-empirical measurement of LHS 6343 C’s apparent luminosity by integrating its observed and modeled spectral energy distribution. Applying knowledge of the system’s distance yields a bolometric luminosity of log(Lbol/L☉) = −4.77 ± 0.03 and, applying the Stefan–Boltzmann law for the known radius, an effective temperature of 1303 ± 29 K. We also use the ATMO-2020 and Sonora-Bobcat evolutionary model grids to infer an age for LHS 6343 C of and respectively.

总结：<br /><br />本文报告了对NGC 6752核心内五颗毫秒射电脉冲星进行了20多年的脉冲星定时观测。研究发现，在GC NGC 6752的核心脉冲星经历了加速度和抖动，这表明核心内至少有2.56 × 103M⊙的非发光物质存在。另外，研究排除了在星团中央存在质量大于或等于∼3000M⊙的中等质量黑洞的可能性。 <div>
Millisecond pulsars are subject to accelerations in globular clusters (GCs) that manifest themselves in both the first and second spin period time derivatives, and can be used to explore the mass distribution of the potentials they inhabit. Here we report on over 20 yr of pulsar timing observations of five millisecond radio pulsars in the core of the core-collapse GC NGC 6752 with the Parkes (Murriyang) and MeerKAT radio telescopes, which have allowed us to measure the proper motions, positions, and first and second time derivatives of the pulsars. The pulsar timing parameters indicate that all the pulsars in the core experience accelerations and jerks that can be explained only if an amount of nonluminous mass of at least 2.56 × 103M⊙ is present in the core of NGC 6752. On the other hand, our studies highly disfavor the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole at the center of the cluster, with a mass equal to or greater than ∼3000M⊙.

总结:
本文主要研究星际气体和星团的动摩擦对黑洞双星形成的影响。首先提出了简单的无量纲摩擦系数来近似描述动摩擦的影响，进行了大量的模拟研究，发现在摩擦较弱时，局部双星形成速率与摩擦系数成线性关系。这些研究结果对于不同尺度上的双星形成具有普遍适用性，如星团中的中等质量黑洞、星际盘中的行星体等。 <div>
Using the equations of motion from Hill’s problem, with added accelerations for different forms of dynamical friction, we provide the (to-date) broadest scale-free study of friction-driven binary formation in gaseous disks and stellar clusters. We focus mainly on binary formation between stellar-mass black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), considering both gas dynamical friction (GDF) from AGN disks and stellar dynamical friction (SDF) from the nuclear star cluster. We first find simple, dimensionless friction coefficients that approximate the effects of standard models for GDF and SDF. We perform extensive simulations of Hill’s problem under such friction, and we present a picture of binary formation through encounters between single stars on nearby orbits, as a function of friction parameter, eccentricity, and inclination. Notably, we find that the local binary formation rate is a linear function of the friction coefficient so long as the friction is weak. Due to the dimensionless nature of our model problem, our findings are generalizable to binary formation at all scales (e.g., intermediate-mass black holes in a star cluster, planetesimals in a gaseous disk).

We present a study of high-cadence, high-precision optical light curves from the TESS satellite of 67 blazars in the southern sky. We provide descriptive flux statistics, power spectral density (PSD) model parameters, and characteristic variability timescales. We find that only 15 BL Lacertae objects (BLLs) and 18 flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) from the initial 26 and 41, respectively, exhibit statistically significant variability. We employ an adapted power spectral response method to test the goodness of fit for the PSD function to three power-law variant models. From our best-fitting description of the PSD, we extract the high-frequency power-spectral slopes, and if present, determine the significant bend or break in the model to identify characteristic timescales. We find no significant difference in the excess variance or rms scatter between blazar subpopulations. We identify a linear rms–flux relation in ∼69% of our sample, in which ∼20% show a strong correlation. We find that both subpopulations of blazars show power spectral slopes of α ∼ 2 in which a broken power-law best fits five BLLs and six FSRQs and a bending power-law best fits one BLL and five FSRQs. The shortest timescales of variability in each light-curve range widely from minutes to weeks. Additionally, these objects’ characteristic timescales range from ∼0.8 to 8 days, consistent with optical variability originating in the jet.

We develop the kappa-tail fitting technique, which analyzes observations of power-law tails of distributions and energy flux spectra, and connects them to theoretical modeling of kappa distributions, to determine the thermodynamics of the examined space plasma.

Then, we apply this technique to a case study by determining the thermodynamics of solar energetic particle (SEP) protons, for an SEP event observed on 2021 April 17, by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP)/Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun instrument suite on board PSP. The results show SEP temperatures and densities of the order of ∼1 MeV and ∼5 × 10−7 cm−3, respectively.

Stellar photospheric inhomogeneities are a significant source of noise, which currently precludes the discovery of Earth-mass planets orbiting Sun-like stars with the radial-velocity (RV) method. To complement several previous studies that have used ground- and spaced-based facilities to characterize the RV of the Sun, here we characterize the center-to-limb variability (CLV) of solar RVs arising from various solar-surface inhomogeneities observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Helioseismic Magnetic Imager and SDO/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly. By using various SDO observables to classify pixels and calculate line-of-sight velocities as a function of pixel classification and limb angle, we show that each identified feature type, including the umbrae and penumbrae of sunspots, quiet-Sun magnetoconvective cells, magnetic network, and plage, exhibit distinct and complex CLV signatures, including a notable limb-angle dependence in the observed suppression of convective blueshift for magnetically active regions. We discuss the observed distributions of velocities by identified region type and limb angle, offer interpretations of the physical phenomena that shape these distributions, and emphasize the need to understand the RV signatures of these regions as astrophysical signals, rather than simple (un)correlated noise processes.

总结:
观测证实了双层丝状通道的存在，该通道由两个丝状结构组成，根源于活跃区和远离的安静区。底层通道表现为间歇性的丝状物质，而上层通道则部分充满暗等离子体，呈现为一个小的丝状物质。通过观测还发现，底层通道的部分爆发是由于重连触发的，随之伴随着明亮的等离子体流向远离的根源。观测结果显示了在充满热/冷等离子体前，双层丝状通道作为一种磁结构的存在。 <div>
We present the observational evidence of the existence of a double-decker filament channel (FC) by using observations in extreme ultraviolet and Hα wavelengths. For both FCs, the east foot-point roots in the active region (AR), while the west one roots in the remote quiet region. The bottom FC (FC1) appears as intermittent filaments. Within the AR, the FC1 appears as an S-shaped filament (F1), which consisted of two J-shaped filaments (F1S/F1N for the south/north one). For the upper one (FC2), only the east part is filled with dark plasma and visible as a small filament (F2). Its east foot-point roots around the junction of F1S and F1N. Initially, due to the recurrent reconnections, F1N and F1S link to each other and form a new filament (F3) thread by thread. Meanwhile, the heated plasma, which appears as brightening features, flows from the east foot-point of F2 to the west, and becomes invisible about 1.1 × 105 km away. The failed eruption of F1S is triggered by the reconnection, which appears as the brightening threads changing their configuration from crossed to quasiparallel in between the F1S and F3, and is confined by the upper magnetic field. Associated with the eruption, the distant invisible plasma becomes visible as a brightening feature. It continuously flows to the remote foot-point, and becomes invisible before reaching it. The brightening plasma flow outlines the skeleton of FC2 gradually. The observations show the existence of a double-decker FC, as a magnetic structure, before they appear as a brightening/dark feature when fully filled with hot/cool plasma.

We present JWST/NIRSpec prism spectroscopy of MACS0647−JD, a triply lensed z ∼ 11 candidate discovered in Hubble Space Telescope imaging and spatially resolved by JWST imaging into two components, A and B. Spectroscopy of component A yields a spectroscopic redshift z = 10.17 based on seven detected emission lines: C iii] λλ1907, 1909, [O ii] λ3727, [Ne iii] λ3869, [Ne iii] λ3968, Hδλ4101, Hγλ4340, and [O iii] λ4363. These are the second-most distant detections of these emission lines to date, in a galaxy observed just 460 million years after the Big Bang. Based on observed and extrapolated line flux ratios we derive a gas-phase metallicity 12 + log(O/H) ∼ 7.5–8.0, or Z ∼ (0.06–0.2) Z⊙, ionization parameter = −1.9 ± 0.2, and an ionizing photon production efficiency erg−1 Hz. The spectrum has a softened Lyα break, evidence for a strong Lyα damping wing. The Lyα damping wing also suppresses the F150W photometry, explaining the slightly overestimated photometric redshift z = 10.6 ± 0.3. MACS0647−JD has a stellar mass log(M/M⊙) = 8.1 ± 0.3, including ∼6 × 107M⊙ in component A, most of which formed recently (within ∼20 Myr) with a star formation rate ∼ 2 ± 1 M⊙ yr−1, all within an effective radius 70 ± 24 pc. Spectroscopy of a fainter companion galaxy C separated by a distance of ∼ 3 kpc reveals a Lyman break consistent with z ∼ 10.17. MACS0647−JD is likely the most distant galaxy merger known.

Circumnuclear star formation (SF) is generally seen in galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN); however, the connection between the AGN activity and SF in them is less well understood. To explore this connection on scales of a few tens of parsecs to a few tens of kiloparsecs and larger, we carried out an investigation of SF in seven Seyfert-type AGN and one low-ionization nuclear emission-line region galaxy, using observations with the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope on board AstroSat in the near-ultraviolet (2000–3000 Å) and far-ultraviolet (1300−1800 Å) bands. A total of 1742 star-forming regions were identified, having size scales of 0.010–63.642 kpc2. Considering all the galaxies, we found a positive correlation between their total surface density of SF (ΣSFR) and extinction. For five galaxies, namely NGC 1365, NGC 4051, NGC 4321, NGC 5033, and NGC 6814, we found a gradual decrease of both extinction and ΣSFR from the centre to the outer regions. Four sources are found to lie in the main sequence of star-forming galaxies, and the other four lie away from it. We found the ratio of the star formation rate (SFR) in the nuclear region to the total SFR to be positively correlated with the Eddington ratio. This points to the influence of AGN in enhancing the SF characteristics of the hosts. However, the impact is dominant only in the central nuclear region and has no significant effect on the larger scales probed in this work.

<div> 磁岛，WISPR，帕克太阳探测器，太阳风，磁重联
总结:<br /><br />本研究利用帕克太阳探测器的WISPR观测到了可能的磁岛特征，并进行了物理分析。磁岛的平均速度约为334 km s−1，加速度约为−0.64 m s−2，表明该磁岛可能被慢太阳风所带动。磁岛呈椭圆形，中心存在密度缺陷，暗示可能存在磁场引导。研究认为这一特征与带状电流层中的重联相关。磁岛的横纵轴比（计算为次轴与主轴的比值）在WISPR观测过程中发生变化，从椭圆形逐渐变为更加圆形。相比于其他白光观测，WISPR的高灵敏度和观测角度使得对这一磁岛特征的观测成为可能。 <div>
We present the identification and physical analysis of a possible magnetic island feature seen in white-light images observed by the Wide-field Imager for Solar Probe (WISPR) on board the Parker Solar Probe. The island is imaged by WISPR during Parker's second solar encounter on 2019 April 6, when Parker was ∼38 R⊙ from the Sun's center. We report that the average velocity and acceleration of the feature are approximately 334 km s−1 and −0.64 m s−2. The kinematics of the island feature, coupled with its direction of propagation, indicate that the island is likely entrained in the slow solar wind. The island is elliptical in shape with a density deficit in its center, suggesting the presence of a magnetic guide field. We argue that this feature is consistent with the formation of this island via reconnection in the current sheet of the streamer. The feature's aspect ratio (calculated as the ratio of its minor to major axis) evolves from an elliptical to a more circular shape that approximately doubles during its propagation through WISPR’s field of view. The island is not distinct in other white-light observations from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory coronagraphs, suggesting that this is a comparatively faint heliospheric feature and that viewing perspective and WISPR’s enhanced sensitivity are key to observing the magnetic island.

<div> 黑洞，引力微透镜，OB110462，速度分布，事件率
<br /><br />
本研究调查了银河系中的黑洞对微透镜事件率分布的影响。研究考虑了不同平均脉冲速度的Maxwell分布，以及黑洞的空间分布的相应变化。研究发现，朝向银河系星系核的黑洞透镜事件率随着平均速度的增加而减少，主要是由于尺度高度的膨胀。重点关注了OB110462的独特微透镜参数，其微透镜视差πE超过0.06，持续时间超过200天。我们计算了OB110462类似参数的黑洞事件在OGLE-IV调查中的预期数量，并将其与实际发生的事件数量进行了比较。我们的模型预测，在vavg = 25, 50, 100, 200和400 km s-1的情况下，预期发生的事件数量分别为0.52, 0.38, 0.18, 0.042和4.0×10^-3。这表明平均脉冲速度可能小于100 km s-1。即使在最大情况下，预期数量也小于单位，这可能表明我们在发现OB110462方面的运气，这可以通过未来的调查，例如罗马空间望远镜加以测试。 
<br />总结:研究调查了银河系中的黑洞对微透镜事件率分布的影响，发现平均脉冲速度可能小于100 km s-1，通过未来的调查可以进一步验证发现OB110462的概率。 <div>
The natal kick velocity distribution for black holes (BHs) is unknown regardless of its importance for understanding the BH formation process. Gravitational microlensing is a unique tool for studying the distribution of BHs in our Galaxy, and the first isolated stellar-mass BH event, OGLE-2011-BLG-0462/MOA-2011-BLG-191 (OB110462), was recently identified by astrometric microlensing. This study investigates how the natal kick velocity for Galactic BHs affects the microlensing event rate distribution. We consider a Maxwell distribution with various average kick velocities, as well as the consequent variation of the spatial distribution of BHs. We find that the event rate for the BH lenses toward the Galactic bulge decreases as vavg increases, mainly due to the scale height inflation. We focus on the unique microlensing parameters measured for OB110462, with microlens parallax πE larger than 0.06 for its long timescale of tE > 200 days. We calculate the expected number of BH events occurring with parameters similar to OB110462 during the OGLE-IV survey by Mróz et al. and compare it with the actual number that occurred, at least one. Our fiducial model predicts 0.52, 0.38, 0.18, 0.042, and 4.0 × 10−3 events occurring for vavg = 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 km s−1, respectively, which suggests that the average kick velocity is likely to be vavg ≲ 100 km s−1. The expected number smaller than unity even at maximum might indicate our luck in finding OB110462, which can be tested with future surveys by, e.g., the Roman Space Telescope.

Over the past few years alone, the lensing community has discovered thousands of strong lens candidates, and spectroscopically confirmed hundreds of them. In this time of abundance, it becomes pragmatic to focus our time and resources on the few extraordinary systems, in order to most efficiently study the Universe. In this paper, we present such a system: DESI-090.9854-35.9683, a cluster-scale lens at zl = 0.49, with seven observed lensed sources around the core, and additional lensed sources further out in the cluster. From the number and the textbook configuration of the lensed images, a tight constraint on the mass potential of the lens is possible. This would allow for detailed analysis on the dark and luminous matter content within galaxy clusters, as well as a probe into dark energy and high-redshift galaxies. We present our spatially resolved kinematic measurements of this system from the Very Large Telescope Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer, which confirm five of these source galaxies (in ascending order, at zs = 0.962, 0.962, 1.166, 1.432, and 1.432). With previous Hubble Space Telescope imaging in the F140W and F200LP bands, we also present a simple flux-based lens model consisting of two power-law profiles that, for a cluster lens, well models the five lensed arc families with redshifts. We determine the mass to be M(< θE) = 4.78 × 1013M⊙ for the primary mass potential. From the model, we extrapolate the redshift of one of the two source galaxies not yet spectroscopically confirmed to be at .

<br /><br />总结:
本研究旨在检查Gaia DR3光度测量和BP/RP光谱的空间均匀性，发现了小的偏差离散度，但存在明显的空间模式，这与Gaia的扫描规律有关。BP和G波段的模式相似，并且比RP波段的模式更明显。进一步独立测试显示，空间模式很可能是由于Gaia DR3 BP/RP光谱引起的。研究证实了Gaia数据在毫星等级上的高空间一致性，但也暗示了Gaia DR3 BP/RP光谱的空间一致性不如光度测量，未来有进一步的改进空间。 <div>
Gaia DR3 photometry and Blue Photometer (BP) and Red Photometer (RP) spectra have been widely used as reference in photometric calibrations. In this work, we check the spatial uniformity of Gaia DR3 photometry and BP/RP spectra by comparing the BP, RP, and G-band photometry with the synthetic ones from the BP/RP spectra. The discrepancies have a small dispersion of 1.07, 0.55, and 1.02 mmag for the BP, RP, and G bands, respectively. However, the discrepancies exhibit obvious spatial patterns, which are clearly associated with Gaia’s scanning law. The patterns observed in the BP and G bands are similar, with discrepancies between photometry and spectra being more pronounced in these bands compared to the RP band. A further independent test with the Dark Energy Survey DR2 photometry reveals that the spatial patterns are more likely attributed to the Gaia DR3 BP/RP spectra, particularly in the BP band. On one hand, our results confirm the high spatial uniformity of Gaia data at the mmag level. On the other hand, our results suggest that the spatial uniformity of Gaia DR3 BP/RP spectra is not as good as that of Gaia DR3 photometry, and could be further improved in the future.

本研究利用Horizon Run 5宇宙学热力学模拟，测试了LAEs和LBGs作为高红移大尺度结构的有效跟踪者。通过比较LAEs和LBGs在暗物质纤维结构周围的空间分布，发现它们比暗物质更集中于纤维结构附近。此外，他们也发现了纤维的垂直密度剖面的经验拟合公式，以及LAEs、LBGs和暗物质定义的纤维结构在空间分布上的一致性。这些结果支持了LAEs和LBGs在高红移时期作为大尺度结构的良好跟踪者的观点。 <div>
We test whether Lyα emitters (LAEs) and Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) can be good tracers of high-z large-scale structures, using the Horizon Run 5 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. We identify LAEs using the Lyα emission line luminosity and its equivalent width, and LBGs using the broadband magnitudes at z ∼ 2.4, 3.1, and 4.5. We first compare the spatial distributions of LAEs, LBGs, all galaxies, and dark matter around the filamentary structures defined by dark matter. The comparison shows that both LAEs and LBGs are more concentrated toward the dark matter filaments than dark matter. We also find an empirical fitting formula for the vertical density profile of filaments as a binomial power-law relation of the distance to the filaments. We then compare the spatial distributions of the samples around the filaments defined by themselves. LAEs and LBGs are again more concentrated toward their filaments than dark matter. We also find the overall consistency between filamentary structures defined by LAEs, LBGs, and dark matter, with the median spatial offsets that are smaller than the mean separation of the sample. These results support the idea that the LAEs and LBGs could be good tracers of large-scale structures of dark matter at high redshifts.

<br /><br />总结: 
太阳耀斑预测的最新研究使用了Space-Weather MDI和SHARP数据，并将它们合并成一种数据产品。通过时间序列分析发现，太阳活动区的磁场特性可能领先于耀斑指数。研究结果显示，在太阳活动周期的高峰期，太阳活动区的高相关性区域对应于耀斑活动的增加。这对于太阳耀斑的预测具有重要意义。 <div>
Solar flare prediction studies have been recently conducted with the use of Space-Weather MDI (Michelson Doppler Imager on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) Active Region Patches (SMARPs) and Space-Weather HMI (Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board Solar Dynamics Observatory) Active Region Patches (SHARPs), which are two currently available data products containing magnetic field characteristics of solar active regions (ARs). The present work is an effort to combine them into one data product, and perform some initial statistical analyses in order to further expand their application in space-weather forecasting. The combined data are derived by filtering, rescaling, and merging the SMARP and SHARP parameters, which can then be spatially reduced to create uniform multivariate time series. The resulting combined MDI–HMI data set currently spans the period between 1996 April 4 and 2022 December 13, and may be extended to a more recent date. This provides an opportunity to correlate and compare it with other space-weather time series, such as the daily solar flare index or the statistical properties of the soft X-ray flux measured by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites. Time-lagged cross correlation indicates that a relationship may exist, where some magnetic field properties of ARs lead the flare index in time. Applying the rolling-window technique makes it possible to see how this leader–follower dynamic varies with time. Preliminary results indicate that areas of high correlation generally correspond to increased flare activity during the peak solar cycle.

通过对TeV辐射明亮的GRB 190114C进行综合的时域和频谱分析，研究了其高能量释放以及辐射转换的效率。发现其快速射流在不同脉冲间有独立的热成分，且整体辐射效率较高。通过结合不同观测情况，测量了火球参数和GRB辐射效率，并发现尽管观测参数有所不同，但从P1和P2获得的辐射效率大致相同，这意味着相同GRB的中心引擎具有一些共同的特性。  <br /><br />总结: <div>
The jet composition of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), as well as how efficiently the jet converts its energy to radiation, are long-standing problems in GRB physics. Here, we reported a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis of the TeV-emitting bright GRB 190114C. Its high fluence (∼4.4 × 10−4 erg cm−2) allows us to conduct the time-resolved spectral analysis in great detail and study their variations down to a very short timescale (∼0.1 s) while preserving a high significance. Its prompt emission consists of three well-separated pulses. The first two main pulses (P1 and P2) exhibit independently strong thermal components, starting from the third pulse (P3) and extending to the entire afterglow, the spectra are all nonthermal, and the synchrotron plus Compton upscattering model well interprets the observation. By combining the thermal (P1 and P2) and the nonthermal (P3) observations based on two different scenarios (global and pulse properties) and following the method described in Zhang et al., we measure the fireball parameters and GRB radiative efficiency with little uncertainties for this GRB. A relevantly high GRB radiative efficiency is obtained based on both the global and pulse properties, suggesting that if GRBs are powered by fireballs, the efficiency can sometimes be high. More interestingly, though the observed parameters are individually different (e.g., the amount of mass loading M), the radiative efficiency obtained from P1 (ηγ = 36.0% ± 6.5%) and P2 (ηγ = 41.1% ± 1.9%) is roughly the same, which implies that the central engine of the same GRB has some common properties.

<div> 关键词: 太阳系, 星际介质, 北领域, 地质证据, 磁流体力学模型

总结: 
太阳系在星际介质中运动，被太阳风形成的日晕保护着。根据地质证据，地球在2-3和5-7百万年前直接接触星际介质。最近的研究表明，太阳在2百万年前经历了一次冷云的遭遇，导致日晕缩小，使得地球暴露在星际介质之下。磁流体力学模型显示，这次经历导致日晕缩小到比地球轨道还要小，从而让地球暴露在寒冷而密集的星际介质之下。这次事件的时间与地质纪录中观测到的波动相匹配，表明太阳经过北领域表面并收缩的日晕可能显著影响了气候和生物圈，这可能是地球历史上的一个新的重要驱动因素。 <div>
The Sun moves through the interstellar medium (ISM) at a velocity of ∼19 pc Myr−1, making the conditions outside the solar system vary with time over millions of years. Today’s solar system is protected from interstellar particles by the heliosphere, the bubble formed by the solar wind as the Sun moves through the ISM, which engulfs the planets. There is geological evidence from 60Fe that Earth was in direct contact with the ISM 2–3 and 5–7 million years ago (MYA). Recent work argues that the Sun encountered a massive cold cloud 2 MYA as part of the Local Ribbon of Cold Clouds that shrunk the heliosphere and exposed Earth to the ISM. Here, we consider the effects of the passage of the Sun through the edge of the Local Bubble occurring at MYA assuming that the Sun encountered a cloud with a density of 900 cm−3. If we consider additional turbulent motion within the cloud due to shocks, the density encountered can be as low as 283 cm−3. Clouds of this density cover a small but nonzero (≲4.6%) fraction of the surface of the Local Bubble, making an encounter plausible. Using a state-of-the art magnetohydrodynamic model, we show that the heliosphere shrank to a scale smaller than Earth’s orbit, thereby exposing Earth to cold dense ISM, consistent with 60Fe evidence. The timing of the event matches perturbations observed in the paleoclimate record recovered from deep-sea sediments. The passage through the Local Bubble’s surface and contraction of the heliosphere therefore may have impacted the climate and biosphere significantly, suggesting a new driver of major events in Earth’s history.

这篇文章讨论了SNe Ia的起源问题。虽然一直以来认为它们来自碳/氧白矮星的爆炸，但确切的祖先构造和导致SNe Ia的爆炸机制仍存在争议。其中一种流行的理论是双重爆炸，即通过二元伴星积累的氦层在主星表面爆炸，导致下面的核心受到收敛的冲击诱发爆炸。研究发现，氦丰富的退化伴星可能会受到主星喷出的物质冲击而引发自己的爆炸。他们还展示了2D模拟，模拟了白矮星进行双重爆炸，触发了退化伴星的爆炸，导致三重或四重爆炸。结果表明，在一定范围内的退化双星质量配置下，这些事件的合成光变曲线和光谱与观测一样好，甚至与独立双重爆炸的理论模型一样。需要进一步了解这种情景，以确定至少一些观测到的SNe Ia是否实际上来自两颗恒星的爆炸。<br /><br />总结: SNe Ia的起源问题是个争议性话题，文章讨论了双重爆炸理论及退化伴星的爆炸，提出了具体研究结果，并强调了对这种场景的进一步理解的必要性。 <div>
The precise origin of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is unknown despite their value to numerous areas in astronomy. While it is a long-standing consensus that they arise from the explosion of a carbon/oxygen white dwarf, the exact progenitor configurations and explosion mechanisms that lead to SNe Ia are still debated. One popular theory is the double detonation, in which a helium layer, accreted from a binary companion, detonates on the surface of the primary star, leading to a converging shock-induced detonation of the underlying core. It has recently been seen in simulations that a helium-rich degenerate companion may undergo its own explosion triggered by the impact from the ejecta of the primary star. We show 2D simulations that approximate a white dwarf undergoing a double detonation, which triggers the explosion of the degenerate companion, leading to either a triple or quadruple detonation. We also present the first multidimensional radiative transfer results from the triple and quadruple detonation scenario. We find that within a range of mass configurations of the degenerate binary, the synthetic light curves and spectra of these events match observations as well as theoretical models of isolated double detonations do. Notably, double and quadruple detonations that are spectrally similar and reach the same peak brightnesses have drastically different ejecta masses and produce different amounts of Si- and Fe-group elements. Further understanding of this scenario is needed in order to determine if at least some observed SNe Ia actually originate from two stars exploding.

The X-ray thermal isolated neutron star (XTINS) RX J0806.4–4123 shows interesting multiwavelength properties that seemingly deviate from those of similar neutron stars. An accurate determination of the spin frequency change over time can assist in interpreting RX J0806.4–4123's properties in comparison to those of other XTINSs and the wider pulsar population. From 2019 to 2023 we carried out a tailored X-ray timing campaign of RX J0806.4–4123 with the NICER instrument. We used statistical properties of the Fourier coefficients and the ZK2 test for phase connecting separate observations and finding a timing solution for the entire data set. We also developed a simple and universal method for estimating the uncertainties of the frequency ν and its derivative from the empirical dependencies of ZK2 on trial values of these parameters, with account of all significant harmonics of the frequency. Applying this method, we determined a spin-down rate . The resulting spin-down power erg s−1 is the lowest among the XTINSs, and it is a factor of 60 lower than the X-ray luminosity of this neutron star. RX J0806.4–4123 is also among the pulsars with the lowest measured in general.

本文提出了一个关于热而稀薄的麦克斯韦分布的质子环以及冷等离子体和电子背景的均匀等离子体系统的全面理论模型，用于研究磁体声波的共振不稳定性。文章通过数值方法解决与麦克斯韦环分布相关的垂直速度积分问题，同时通过调用等离子体色散函数的级数展开解析地解决了平行速度积分问题。对于地球内磁层相关的等离子体参数，理论模型产生了频率从本地质子回旋频率的5倍到低杂波频率以上的磁体声波，传播角度为89.5°。对于相同的等离子体参数，麦克斯韦环质子还激发了氢（H+）带电磁离子回旋波。详细分析表明，足够大的环速度以及较小的垂直和平行热速度可以增强磁体声波的增长。该研究还探讨了背景等离子体参数在调制波动中的作用。当前的理论模型重现了Van Allen Probes在地球内磁层观测到的磁体声波的谐波。此外，该模型还可以在其他等离子体环境中产生磁体声波，例如火星，在这里，MAVEN已经确认了环质子与磁体声波观测的关联。 <div>
A comprehensive theoretical model for a homogeneous plasma system of hot, tenuous Maxwellian ring-distributed protons and the cold background of Maxwellian ions and electrons is used to study the resonant instabilities of magnetosonic (MS) waves. The perpendicular velocity integrals associated with the Maxwellian ring distribution have no analytical solution, hence, are solved numerically, while the parallel velocity integrals are solved analytically by invoking series expansion of the plasma dispersion function. For the plasma parameters relevant to Earth’s inner magnetosphere, the theoretical model generates MS waves with frequencies from 5 times the local proton cyclotron frequency to above the lower hybrid frequency for a propagation angle of 89.5°. Hydrogen (H+) band electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves are also excited by the Maxwellian ring protons for the same set of plasma parameters. A detailed analysis reveals that a sufficiently large ring velocity, as well as a smaller perpendicular and parallel thermal velocity, can enhance the MS wave growth. The study also explores the role of background plasma parameters in modulating the waves. The present theoretical model reproduces the harmonics of the MS waves observed by the Van Allen Probes in the Earth’s inner magnetosphere. Further, the model can generate MS waves in other plasma environments, e.g., Mars, where the presence of ring protons has been established by MAVEN in connection with the MS wave observations.

这项研究提出了一种利用宽双星的标准化速度剖面来调查低加速度重力异常的新方法。研究使用Monte Carlo方法对Gaia观测到的双星及其虚拟的牛顿对应体在s/rM与平面上进行概率分布，并在s/rM的bin中测量了一个对数速度比参数Γ。通过三种双星样本的研究，作者发现了从牛顿平坦线的一致系统变化。作者提出了重力异常因子γg = 102Γ，通过减少的χ2检验，发现牛顿重力被最新样本排除5.8σ，并且使用最大样本排除9.2σ。米尔格罗米安AQUAL理论被证明是可接受的。这些结果与先前的“加速度平面分析”和“叠加速度剖面分析”的结果相吻合。 
<br /><br />总结: 本研究提出了一种新的方法来研究重力异常，通过分析双星的速度剖面，并测量了重力异常因子γg。研究结果表明牛顿重力被排除，而米尔格罗米安AQUAL理论被证明是可接受的。 <div>
Low-acceleration gravitational anomaly is investigated with a new method of exploiting the normalized velocity profile of wide binary stars as a function of the normalized sky-projected radius s/rM, where vp is the sky-projected relative velocity between the pair, vc is the Newtonian circular velocity at the sky-projected separation s, and rM is the MOND radius. With a Monte Carlo method, Gaia observed binaries and their virtual Newtonian counterparts are probabilistically distributed on the s/rM versus plane, and a logarithmic velocity ratio parameter Γ is measured in the bins of s/rM. With three samples of binaries covering a broad range in size, data quality, and implied fraction of hierarchical systems including a new sample of 6389 binaries selected with accurate distances and radial velocities, I find a unanimous systematic variation from the Newtonian flat line. With Γ = 0 at s/rM ≲ 0.15 or s ≲ 1 kau, I get Γ = 0.068 ± 0.015 (stat) (syst) for s/rM ≳ 0.7 or s ≳ 5 kau. The gravitational anomaly (i.e., acceleration boost) factor given by γg = 102Γ is measured to be (stat) (syst). With a reduced χ2 test of Newtonian and Milgromian nonrelativistic theories, I find that Newtonian gravity is ruled out at 5.8σ ( ) by the new sample (and 9.2σ by the largest sample used). The Milgromian AQUAL theory is acceptable with . These results agree well with earlier results with the “acceleration-plane analysis” for a variety of samples and the “stacked velocity profile analysis” for a pure binary sample.

<div> SN 2022oqm, CaRT, spectroscopic evolution, peak luminosity, progenitor <br />
<br />总结:
本文研究了SN 2022oqm的光度和光谱演化，发现它是一个多峰值的氢和氦贫钙丰富的瞬变事件（CaRT）。该事件距离其宿主星系NGC 5875有13.1 kpc。研究发现SN 2022oqm的峰值亮度相对较高（MB = −17 mag），是CaRT中的异常值。研究表明，需要三种不同的能量源来解释光度曲线的演化，分别对应于三个峰值。通过光度曲线的推导，得出了喷射物质和56Ni的质量，以及氢和氦缺乏的CSM。光谱建模显示约0.6 M⊙的喷射物质，并且其中充满了良好混合的Fe峰元素。作者讨论了SN 2022oqm的几种物理起源，认为一个大质量的白矮星前体或一个特殊的剥离包络模型可以解释SN 2022oqm。一个在稠密的、缺乏氢和氦的CSM内发生的剥离包络爆炸，类似于SNe Icn，但具有大质量的56Ni和小质量的CSM可以解释SN 2022oqm。另外，对于一个意外大质量的白矮星发生的氦爆也能解释SN 2022oqm。 <div>
We present the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of SN 2022oqm, a nearby multipeaked hydrogen- and helium-weak calcium-rich transient (CaRT). SN 2022oqm was detected 13.1 kpc from its host galaxy, the face-on spiral galaxy NGC 5875. Extensive spectroscopic coverage reveals an early hot (T ≥ 40,000 K) continuum and carbon features observed ∼1 day after discovery, SN Ic-like photospheric-phase spectra, and strong forbidden calcium emission starting 38 days after discovery. SN 2022oqm has a relatively high peak luminosity (MB = −17 mag) for CaRTs, making it an outlier in the population. We determine that three power sources are necessary to explain the light curve (LC), with each corresponding to a distinct peak. The first peak is powered by an expanding blackbody with a power-law luminosity, suggesting shock cooling by circumstellar material (CSM). Subsequent LC evolution is powered by a double radioactive decay model, consistent with two sources of photons diffusing through optically thick ejecta. From the LC, we derive an ejecta mass and 56Ni mass of ∼0.6 M⊙ and ∼0.09 M⊙. Spectroscopic modeling ∼0.6 M⊙ of ejecta, and with well-mixed Fe-peak elements throughout. We discuss several physical origins for SN 2022oqm and find either a surprisingly massive white dwarf progenitor or a peculiar stripped envelope model could explain SN 2022oqm. A stripped envelope explosion inside a dense, hydrogen- and helium-poor CSM, akin to SNe Icn, but with a large 56Ni mass and small CSM mass could explain SN 2022oqm. Alternatively, helium detonation on an unexpectedly massive white dwarf could also explain SN 2022oqm.

We report the serendipitous multiwavelength discovery of a candidate dual black hole system with a separation of ∼100 pc, in the gas-rich luminous infrared galaxy MCG-03-34-64 (z = 0.016). Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys observations show three distinct optical centroids in the [O iii] narrow-band and F814W images. Subsequent analysis of Chandra/ACIS data shows two spatially resolved peaks of equal intensity in the neutral Fe Kα (6.2–6.6 keV) band, while high-resolution radio continuum observations with the Very Large Array at 8.46 GHz (3.6 cm band) show two spatially coincident radio peaks. Fast shocks as the ionizing source seem unlikely, given the energies required for the production of Fe Kα. If confirmed, the separation of ∼100 pc would represent the closest dual active galactic nuclei reported to date with spatially resolved, multiwavelength observations.

We present near-infrared spectroscopy of 10 weak emission-line quasars (WLQs) at redshifts of z ∼ 2, obtained with the Palomar 200 inch Hale Telescope. WLQs are an exceptional population of type 1 quasars that exhibit weak or no broad emission lines in the ultraviolet (e.g., the C ivλ1549 line), and they display remarkable X-ray properties. We derive Hβ-based single-epoch virial black hole masses (median value 1.7 × 109M⊙) and Eddington ratios (median value 0.5) for our sources. We confirm the previous finding that WLQ Hβ lines, as a major low-ionization line, are not significantly weak compared to typical quasars. The most prominent feature of the WLQ optical spectra is the universally weak/absent [O iii] λ5007 emission. They also display stronger optical Fe ii emission than typical quasars. Our results favor the super-Eddington accretion scenario for WLQs, where the weak lines are a result of a soft ionizing continuum; the geometrically thick inner accretion disk and/or its associated outflow is responsible for obscuring the nuclear high-energy radiation and producing the soft ionizing continuum. We also report candidate extreme [O iii] outflows (blueshifts of ≈500 and 4900 km s−1) in one object.

这篇文章使用绿岸望远镜对银河系两个视线进行了无线再组合线观测。观测结果显示每个视线有两个高斯形状的光谱分量，其发射测量范围在约100至300厘米^-6 pc之间。在光度学选择速率（LSR）速度为负时，没有可检测到的RRL发射，这表明辐射等离子体必须位于太阳轨道内部。G20和G45的发射测量暗示如果这些视线充满均匀等离子体，其均方根密度分别为0.15和0.18厘米^-3。观测到的Hnβ/Hnα线比与LTE激发的最强分量一致。G20的高速度分量具有较窄的线宽（13.5 km s^-1），这为等离子体电子温度设置了上限（≲4000 K），这与普遍存在的低密度约为10,000 K的WIM等离子体的假设不一致。
<br /><br />总结: 该研究使用绿岸望远镜观测了银河系中的离子化气体，发现了两个视线中的RRL发射，并推测了等离子体发射测量的均方根密度。观测结果还表明，高速度分量的等离子体电子温度上限低于10,000 K的普遍假设。 <div>
Diffuse ionized gas pervades the disk of the Milky Way. We detect extremely faint emission from this Galactic warm ionized medium (WIM) using the Green Bank Telescope to make radio recombination line (RRL) observations toward two Milky Way sight lines: G20, (ℓ, b) = (20°, 0°), and G45, (ℓ, b) = (45°, 0°). We stack 18 consecutive Hnα transitions between 4.3 and 7.1 GHz to derive 〈Hnα〉 spectra that are sensitive to RRL emission from plasmas with emission measures EM ≳ 10 cm−6 pc. Each sight line has two Gaussian-shaped spectral components with emission measures that range between ∼100 and ∼300 cm−6 pc. Because there is no detectable RRL emission at negative LSR velocities, the emitting plasma must be located interior to the solar orbit. The G20 and G45 emission measures imply rms densities of 0.15 and 0.18 cm−3, respectively, if these sight lines are filled with homogeneous plasma. The observed 〈Hnβ〉/〈Hnα〉 line ratios are consistent with LTE excitation for the strongest components. The high-velocity component of G20 has a narrow line width, 13.5 km s−1, that sets an upper limit of ≲4000 K for the plasma electron temperature. This is inconsistent with the ansatz of a canonically pervasive, low-density, ∼10,000 K WIM plasma.

总结:
该研究使用了PDS来研究伽马射线暴（GRB）的光变曲线，利用了Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope（Insight-HXMT）的数据。对长暴和短暴分别进行了能谱指数的分析，结果显示长暴和短暴的能谱指数相似，表明它们可能是相似的随机过程的结果。此外，研究还发现伽马射线暴的光变曲线可能是由多个具有不同时间尺度的脉冲叠加而成。在样本中没有发现高于3σ显著性阈值的周期性或准周期性信号。伽马射线暴的光变曲线与能谱的关系也被研究出来，有助于对伽马射线暴的物理过程进行更深入的理解。 <br /><br /> <div>
The power density spectrum (PDS) is a powerful tool to study light curves of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We show the average PDS and individual PDS analysis with GRB data from the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (also named Insight-HXMT). The values of the power-law index of the average PDS ( ) for long GRBs (LGRBs) vary from 1.58 to 1.29 (for 100–245, 245–600, and 600–2000 keV). The Insight-HXMT data allow us to extend the energy of the LGRBs up to 2000 keV, and a relation between and energy E is obtained: (8–2000 keV). We first systematically investigate the average PDS and individual PDSs for short GRBs (SGRBs), and obtain (8–1000 keV), where the values of vary from 1.86 to 1.34. The distribution of the power-law index of an individual PDS (α) of an SGRB is consistent with that of an LGRB, and the α value for the group with a dominant timescale (the bent power law) is higher than that for the group with no dominant timescale (the single power law). Both LGRBs and SGRBs show similar α and , which indicates that they may be the result of similar stochastic processes. Typical values of the dominant timescale τ for LGRBs and SGRBs are 1.58 s and 0.02 s, respectively. It seems that τ varies in proportion to the duration of GRBs T90, with a relation . The GRB light curve may result from superposing a number of pulses with different timescales. No periodic or quasi-periodic signal above the 3σ significance threshold is found in our sample.

The distribution of chemical species in protoplanetary disks around young stars, especially their division between gas and solid phases, fundamentally shapes the composition of future planets and planetesimals. This distribution is likely affected by entrapment, a mechanism whereby volatile species are mechanically or chemically bound within a less volatile ice. In this study, we investigate the entrapment efficiencies of four hypervolatiles (CH4, CO, N2, and Ar) in multicomponent water ice mixtures deposited at different temperatures and mixture ratios. At low ice deposition temperatures, we observe small differences in entrapment efficiency (CH4>CO>N2∼Ar) up to a factor of two across species. The differences in entrapment between species increase by up to an order of magnitude with increasing deposition temperature. The relative entrapment efficiencies are also impacted by changes in the overall hypervolatile concentration of the ice mixtures. Collectively, these experiments suggest that relative entrapment efficiencies are mainly regulated by small differences in binding energies to the ice matrix, though competition for the best sites also influences entrapment in more concentrated ices. We use these results to better inform interpretations of hypervolatile observations in comets and related objects.

Coronal jets are one of the most common eruptive activities in the solar atmosphere. They are related to rich physics processes, including, but not limited to, magnetic reconnection, flaring, instabilities, and plasma heating. Automated identification of off-limb coronal jets has been difficult due to their abundant nature, complex appearance, and relatively small size compared to other features in the corona. In this paper, we present an automated jet identification algorithm (AJIA) that utilizes true and fake jets previously detected by a laborious semiautomated jet detection algorithm (SAJIA) as the input of an image segmentation neural network U-NET. It is found that AJIA can achieve a much higher (0.81) detecting precision than SAJIA (0.34) while giving the possibility of whether each pixel in an input image belongs to a jet. We demonstrate that with the aid of artificial neural networks, AJIA can enable fast, accurate, and real-time off-limb coronal jet identification from Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly 304 Å observations, which are essential in studying the collective and long-term behavior of coronal jets and their relation to the solar activity cycles.

We present a rigorous study of compact objects within f(Q) gravity where electrical fields and dark matter are studied and provide novel mass–radius relations with models falling in the mass gap of the events GW190814 and GW200210. After formulating the basic equations and finding their relevant solutions, we impose the boundary conditions on the system under treatment. The decoupled solution for the strange stellar model with the dark matter density profile is obtained. The distribution patterns of the effective energy density and the radial as well as the tangential pressure and anisotropy in the system are intensively examined. The stability properties of the stellar configuration and the influence of dark matter are studied. The recent observations of supermassive compact star candidates such as PSR J1614–2230 and PSR J0952–0607 with observed masses greater than or equal to 2 M⊙ have been employed in our study. Interestingly, the present study predicts the constraints on mass–radius measurements of the observed stars satisfying the equation of state based on the MIT bag model and employing the condition of mimicking, i.e., ρθ = in f(Q) gravity. Our graphical results exhibit that for a particular M–R curve with fixed values of the parameters, neutron stars having mass less than Mmax exist with larger radii within the context of the f(Q) formalism.

We extract a 7 day binned γ-ray light curve in the energy range 0.1–500 GeV and identify seven outburst periods with a peak flux of >4.32 × 10−7 ph cm−2 s−1. The highest 7 day flux (above 100 MeV) reaches (8.06 ± 0.56) × 10−7 erg cm−2 s−1 on MJD = 56177.16, which is 10 times higher than the flux in the quiescent period. To understand the properties of distant blazar jets, we employ a standard one-zone leptonic scenario and model the multiwavelength spectral energy distributions of one quiescent and seven flaring periods. We find that the γ-ray spectrum is better reproduced when the dissipation region of the jet, Rdiss, is located within the molecular torus, where infrared emission is the dominant external photon field. We infer that the jets in higher-redshift blazars have larger power and kinetic energy, where the kinetic energy is significantly greater than the radiation power, and the jet production efficiency suggests that we need to lower the accretion efficiency. These results imply that B3 1343+451 may have a standard thin disk surrounding its massive black hole, and the jets of B3 1343+451 may not be fully explained by the Blandford–Payne process.

<div> 关键词: 化学丰度，星系化学演化，恒星形成星系，氧和镁，质量-金属丰度关系
总结:
本研究使用Keck Cosmic Web Imager观测46个低红移、低质量恒星形成星系和两个质量为10^8.8M⊙的静止星系，旨在探讨介于本地星系群卫星星系和大质量场星系之间的星系化学演化。我们开发了一种新的方法，同时确定了恒星中的铁和镁丰度。利用强线法测量气相氧丰度(O/H)g，我们首次能够对星际介质和恒星中的α元素进行直接比较。我们发现[Mg/H]*–[O/H]g关系比[Fe/H]*–[O/H]g关系更紧密，这可以通过α元素的类似产生过程来解释。我们的样本中大多数星系的[O/H]g都高于[Fe/H]*和[Mg/H]*。此外，我们构建了作为三种不同元素(Fe*, Mg*, Og)的质量-金属丰度关系(MZR)。与气体O-MZR相比，恒星Fe-MZR和Mg-MZR显示出更大的离散度，这是由于特定星形成率(sSFR)的变化所驱动的，具有较高sSFR的恒星形成星系在固定质量下显示出较高的sSFR和较低的恒星丰度。[O/H]g相对于恒星丰度的过量以及sSFR与恒星丰度的反相关暗示，M* ∼ 10^8−10M⊙的中等质量星系的淘汰主要是由于饥饿驱动的。<br /><br /> <div>
Understanding the chemical enrichment of different elements is crucial to gaining a complete picture of galaxy chemical evolution. In this study, we present a new sample of 46 low-redshift, low-mass star-forming galaxies at M* ∼ 108−10M⊙ along with two quiescent galaxies at M* ∼ 108.8M⊙ observed with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager, aiming to investigate the chemical evolution of galaxies in the transition zone between Local Group satellites and massive field galaxies. We develop a novel method to simultaneously determine stellar abundances of iron and magnesium in star-forming galaxies. With the gas-phase oxygen abundance (O/H)g measured using the strong-line method, we are able to make the first-ever apples-to-apples comparison of α elements in the stars and the interstellar medium. We find that the [Mg/H]*–[O/H]g relation is much tighter than the [Fe/H]*–[O/H]g relation, which can be explained by the similar production processes of α elements. Most galaxies in our sample exhibit higher [O/H]g than [Fe/H]* and [Mg/H]*. In addition, we construct mass–metallicity relations (MZRs) measured as three different elements (Fe*, Mg*, Og). Compared to the gas O-MZR, the stellar Fe- and Mg-MZRs show larger scatter driven by variations in specific star formation rates (sSFR), with star-forming galaxies exhibiting higher sSFR and lower stellar abundances at fixed mass. The excess of [O/H]g compared to stellar abundances as well as the anticorrelation between sSFR and stellar abundance suggests that galaxy quenching of intermediate-mass galaxies at M* ∼ 108−10M⊙ is primarily driven by starvation.

<div> 天体行星形成，太阳系，盘状模型，N体模拟，内迁
总结:
天体行星形成，包括太阳系中的地球和超地球/亚类海王星系统，可以通过模拟在一个盘状模型中进行。N体模拟表明，质量小于地球质量的行星形成于离太阳1天文单位远的区域，不会向内偏移，保持高的径向质量浓度。质量大于地球质量的行星则会在盘状模型的外迁区域缓慢向内迁移，最终可能移动到大约10天的轨道上。这一模型预测，来自离太阳1天文单位远附近的环内迁形成的地球和次地球在近内迁区域不会很常见。 <div>
For the origin of the radially concentrated solar system’s terrestrial planets, planet formation from a ring of solids at about 1 au from the Sun with convergent/suppressed type I migration is preferred. On the other hand, many super-Earths and sub-Neptunes are found in the close-in region with orbital periods of 10–100 days, so that planet formation from rings in the 1 au region would require some degree of inward migration. One way to realize these different formation scenarios is to use different gas disk models. In this study, we investigate whether different scenarios can be realized within a single framework. We consider a disk model that evolves via disk winds and develops a density peak, and study planet formation and orbital evolution using N-body simulations. Planets with masses less than an Earth mass formed from a low-mass ring resembling the solar system do not migrate inward even in the evolving disk and remain near 1 au orbits, maintaining a high radial mass concentration. On the other hand, planets with masses greater than an Earth mass formed from a massive ring slowly migrate inward above the outward migration region. As a result, the innermost planet can move to an orbit of about 10 days. The simulation results also reproduce the characteristics (e.g., mass distribution, eccentricity, orbital separation) of the solar system and super-Earth/sub-Neptune systems. Our model predicts that Earths and sub-Earths formed by migration from rings near the 1 au region are less abundant in the close-in region.

<div> 超大质量黑洞，相对论性喷流，星系演化，宇宙微波背景透镜，宇宙大结构
<br />
这项研究通过对低频射电星系的聚类和宇宙微波背景透镜效应的测量，来限制超大质量黑洞产生的喷流与周围气体介质相互作用的环境。研究发现这些系统位于类似于星系团的暗物质晕的内部，并且这些暗物质晕的增长速率与过去约100亿年暗物质晕平均增长速率一致。聚类和光度函数的共同演变表明这些系统的工作周期大约为10％，但自大约z∼2以来略有增加，而类星体的工作周期却在下降。在动力学上，强大的喷流加热优于类星体风对于暗物质晕和星系团质量的作用，这与星系演化的范式一致，其中机械喷流能量反馈是团和星系团中气体含量的主要加热机制。
<br /><br />总结: 超大质量黑洞形成的相对论性喷流对于星系演化具有重要影响，在过去100亿年里，这些系统占据着类星体质量为1013–1014太阳质量的暗物质晕，呈现出工作周期大约为10％的特征，而且在过去的演化过程中有所增加。与此同时，它们在质量大于1013太阳质量的暗物质晕内的加热作用也优于类星体。 <div>
Coupling between relativistic jets launched by accreting supermassive black holes and the surrounding gaseous media is a vital ingredient in galaxy evolution models. To constrain the environments in which this feedback takes place over cosmic time, we study the host-halo properties of luminous low-frequency radio galaxies (L150 MHz ≳ 1025.25 W Hz−1) selected with the International Low-Frequency Array Telescope out to z ∼ 2 through tomographic clustering and cosmic microwave background lensing measurements. We find that these systems occupy halos characteristic of galaxy groups (Mh = 1013–1014h−1 M⊙), evolving at a rate consistent with the mean growth rate of halos over the past ∼10 Gyr. The coevolution of the clustering and the luminosity function reveals that the duty cycle of these systems is of order ∼10% but has been mildly increasing since z ∼ 2, while the duty cycle of quasars has been declining. We estimate the characteristic kinetic heating power injected by powerful jets per halo as a function of mass, and compare to the same quantity injected by quasar winds. We find that powerful jet heating dominates over quasar winds in halos Mh ≳ 1013 h−1 M⊙ at z < 2. These results conform to the paradigm of galaxy evolution in which mechanical jet power feedback is the dominant heating mechanism of the gas content of groups and clusters.

总结: 
本文研究了等离子湍流的动力学模型，在模拟实验中系统地变化了离子-电子质量比，发现质量比对动力学范围的动态和等离子体加热都有重要影响。对离子和电子而言，质量比的改变导致了加热/耗散过程的本质巨大变化，同时也对加热过程产生了显著影响。最终发现，离子-电子质量比约为250时，可以捕捉到电子加热的渐近行为。本研究揭示了等离子体湍流动力学中质量比的重要影响。 <div>
Understanding plasma turbulence requires a synthesis of experiments, observations, theory, and simulations. In the case of kinetic plasmas such as the solar wind, the lack of collisions renders the fluid closures such as viscosity meaningless and one needs to resort to higher-order fluid models or kinetic models. Typically, the computational expense in such models is managed by simulating artificial values of certain parameters such as the ratio of the Alfvén speed to the speed of light (vA/c) or the relative mass ratio of ions and electrons (mi/me). Although, typically care is taken to use values as close as possible to realistic values within the computational constraints, these artificial values could potentially introduce unphysical effects. These unphysical effects could be significant at sub-ion scales, where kinetic effects are the most important. In this paper, we use the 10-moment fluid model in the Gkeyll framework to perform controlled numerical experiments, systematically varying the ion–electron mass ratio from a small value down to the realistic proton–electron mass ratio. We show that the unphysical mass ratio has a significant effect on the kinetic range dynamics as well as the heating of both plasma species. The dissipative process for both ions and electrons becomes more compressive in nature, although the ions remain nearly incompressible in all cases. The electrons move from being dominated by incompressive viscous-like heating/dissipation to very compressive heating/dissipation dominated by compressions/rarefactions. While the heating change is significant for the electrons, a mass ratio of mi/me ∼ 250 captures the asymptotic behavior of electron heating.

<div> Andromeda XVIII, dwarf galaxy, spectroscopy, metallicity, quenching<br />
<br />总结:<br />Andromeda XVIII是一种孤立的矮星系，可能受到M31近距离经过的影响，其金属丰度分布不符合简单的化学演化模型，表明星形成可能突然中断。平均速度和金属丰度与M31相对速度表明可能是由于M31的近距离经过导致的气体损失或者内部反馈对星系形成的影响。 <div>
Andromeda XVIII is an isolated dwarf galaxy 579 kpc away from the nearest large galaxy, M31. It is a candidate “backsplash galaxy” that might have been affected by a close passage to M31. We present new Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy of Andromeda XVIII to assess the likelihood that it is a backsplash galaxy. We estimated the velocities, metallicities ([Fe/H]), and α-enhancements ([α/Fe]) for 56 probable members. Based on the abundances of 38 stars with low errors (δ[Fe/H] < 0.3), parameters for the simplest chemical evolution models were estimated using the maximum likelihood coupled with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The metallicity distribution is inconsistent with these models, due to a sharp metal-rich cutoff. We estimated Andromeda XVIII’s mean heliocentric velocity, rotation velocity, position angle of the rotation axis, and velocity dispersion using the maximum likelihood coupled with an MCMC. There is no evidence for bulk rotation, though subpopulations might be rotating. The mean heliocentric velocity is −337.2 km s−1, such that the line-of-sight velocity relative to M31 is lower than the escape velocity from M31. Together, the metallicity distribution and the mean velocity are consistent with a sudden interruption of star formation. For possible causes of this quenching, we considered gas loss due to ram pressure stripping during a close passage by M31 or due to a past major merger. However, we cannot rule out internal feedback (i.e., a terminal wind).

Near-Earth supernova blasts which engulf the solar system have left traces of their ejecta in the geological and lunar records. There is now a wealth of data on live radioactive 60Fe pointing to a supernova at 3 Myr ago, as well as the recent discovery of an event at 7 Myr ago. We use the available measurements to evaluate the distances to these events. For the better analyzed supernova at 3 Myr, samples include deep-sea sediments, ferromanganese crusts, and lunar regolith; we explore the consistency among and across these measurements, which depends sensitively on the uptake of iron in the samples as well as possible anisotropies in the 60Fe fallout. There is also significant uncertainty in the astronomical parameters needed for these calculations. We take the opportunity to perform a parameter study on the effects that the ejected 60Fe mass from a core-collapse supernova and the fraction of dust that survives the remnant have on the resulting distance. We find that with an ejected 60Fe mass of 3 × 10−5M⊙ and a dust fraction of 10%, the distance range for the supernova 3 Myr ago is D ∼ 20–140 pc, with the most likely range between 50 and 65 pc. Using the same astrophysical parameters, the distance for the supernova at 7 Myr ago is D ∼ 110 pc. We close with a brief discussion of geological and astronomical measurements that can improve these results.

<div> 关键词: GRBs, 外部冲击模型, 光度曲线, 初能标, 磁场强度
总结:
外部冲击模型在薄壳情景下预测了伽马射线暴（GRBs）光学余辉曲线中的起始颠峰。研究收集了30个GRBs的典型光度曲线样本，并从其X射线和光学余辉曲线的联合拟合中推导了射流特性。结果发现，初始洛伦兹因子（Γ0）、减速半径（Rdec）和磁场强度（B0）的分布是对数正态的，但等离子体动能（Ek,iso）、介质密度（n0）和磁化参数（σB）的分布可能是双峰的。发现了严格的Rdec-B0-σB关系，推测支持先前的观点，即GRB辐射能量在GRBs之间是普遍存在的。模拟了26个GRBs的光度曲线需要喷流折射。射流开角和校正后的动能的分布分别呈对数正态分布（标准差σ=0.27）和（σ=0.54）。那些（19个GRBs）其中，其俄罗斯语报均匀估计出广能量段观测，可满足先前发现的Lγ，p，iso–Ep，z–Γ0关系，并且它们的γ射线辐射效率对数正态地分布在0.04%到10%范围内，中心值为0.42%。这种低效率有利于重子火球模型，并且它们的质子质量加载在GRB抛射物中的分布对数正态地集中在（σ=0.75）。 <div>
The standard external shock model in the thin-shell scenario predicts an onset bump in the early optical afterglow light curves of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We collect such a textbook-version light-curve sample of 30 GRBs and derive the jet properties from our joint fit to their X-ray and optical afterglow light curves. It is found that the distributions of the isotropic initial Lorentz factors (Γ0), the deceleration radii (Rdec), and the magnetic field strength (B0) are log-normal, but the distributions of the isotropic kinetic energy (Ek,iso), medium density (n0), and magnetization parameter (σB ≡ ϵB/ϵe) are tentatively bimodal. A tight Rdec–B0–σB relation is found. It infers a universal ϵeEk,iso among bursts, plausibly supporting the previous argument of a universal GRB radiation energy among GRBs. A jet break is required for modeling the light curves of 26 GRBs. The distributions of the jet opening angles and the jet-corrected kinetic energies log-normally center at (standard deviation σ = 0.27) and (σ = 0.54), respectively. Those GRBs (19 GRBs), whose prompt gamma-ray emission is well estimated with broad energy-band observations, satisfy the previously discovered Lγ,p,iso–Ep,z–Γ0 relation, and their gamma-ray radiation efficiencies log-normally distribute in the range from 0.04% to 10% with a central value of 0.42%. Such a low efficiency favors the baryonic fireball model, and the distribution of their baryon mass loading in the GRB ejecta log-normally centers at (σ = 0.75).

Recently Gagné et al. suggested that young moving groups with similar kinematic properties could be part of larger dissolving structures. One example was IC 2602 as the core of a group of associations, including its corona (CIC 2602), Tucana-Horologium (THA), and parts of Theia 92. We explore this hypothesis by measuring the rotation periods of 953 objects selected using Gaia DR3 kinematics from IC 2602, CIC 2602, Theia 92, and a newly identified group of stars that bridge IC 2602 and THA. We use Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) full frame images to measure new rotation periods and combine these with the rotation periods for THA from Popinchalk et al. to compare their rotation period distributions and other youth indicators where available to examine if the groups could be coeval. We find strong agreement between the rotation distributions of IC 2602, CIC 2602, and THA, suggesting a shared age of ∼40 Myr, and which in combination could serve as an example of a typical distribution at this age. Theia 92 does not agree at the same level, and we explore the potential kinematic reasons it does not match the rotation period distribution of the larger groups. Additionally, in our light curve analysis we identify ∼50 potential binaries, as well as four new M dwarf complex rotators that show major morphological changes between TESS cycles. Finally, using the amplitudes of the rotation periods we measured, we find strong agreement with the amplitude–age relation presented in Morris for our 40 Myr groups.

<div> SN 2024ggi, type II supernova, NGC 3621, UV-optical-near-infrared observations, progenitor mass-loss rate

总结:
SN 2024ggi是位于NGC 3621的II型超新星，通过UV-光学-近红外观测以及建模分析，发现其具有IIn-like特征，暗示其周围存在光电离的厚CSM。在观测的不同时间点上，发现了He ii，C iv，N iv/v和O v的发射线，显示出蓝向偏移的特征，这可能是由于扩展而密集的CSM引起的。此外，SN 2024ggi的峰值UV-光学绝对星等与已知的CSM相互作用的II型超新星的特征一致。建立的辐射流体力学模拟显示，爆发前约3年，SN 2024ggi的前体星经历了增强的质量流失。 <div>
We present UV–optical–near-infrared observations and modeling of supernova (SN) 2024ggi, a type II supernova (SN II) located in NGC 3621 at 7.2 Mpc. Early-time (“flash”) spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi within +0.8 days of discovery shows emission lines of H i, He i, C iii, and N iii with a narrow core and broad, symmetric wings (i.e., “IIn-like”) arising from the photoionized, optically thick, unshocked circumstellar material (CSM) that surrounded the progenitor star at shock breakout (SBO). By the next spectral epoch at +1.5 days, SN 2024ggi showed a rise in ionization as emission lines of He ii, C iv, N iv/v, and O v became visible. This phenomenon is temporally consistent with a blueward shift in the UV–optical colors, both likely the result of SBO in an extended, dense CSM. The IIn-like features in SN 2024ggi persist on a timescale of tIIn = 3.8 ± 1.6 days, at which time a reduction in CSM density allows the detection of Doppler-broadened features from the fastest SN material. SN 2024ggi has peak UV–optical absolute magnitudes of Mw2 = −18.7 mag and Mg = −18.1 mag, respectively, that are consistent with the known population of CSM-interacting SNe II. Comparison of SN 2024ggi with a grid of radiation hydrodynamics and non–local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative-transfer simulations suggests a progenitor mass-loss rate of yr−1 (vw = 50 km s−1), confined to a distance of r < 5 × 1014 cm. Assuming a wind velocity of vw = 50 km s−1, the progenitor star underwent an enhanced mass-loss episode in the last ∼3 yr before explosion.

<div> NDAF, SGWB, neutrino, CCSN, metallicity
<br /><br />总结:
本研究通过对回落型核心坍缩超新星（CCSN）模拟的结果，研究了以中微子为主导的吸积流（NDAFs）产生的随机引力波背景（SGWB）。研究发现，预测的SGWB主要取决于典型CCSN初始爆炸能量和母体金属丰度。在乐观情况下，如果典型的初始爆炸能量较低，则NDAFs产生的SGWB可能会被下一代太空干涉仪（如DECi-hertz干涉引力波观测器和宇宙大爆炸观测器）探测到。在低频领域∼10−3–10−1 Hz，该背景与标准的通货膨胀模型预期的背景相当。因此，NDAFs产生的SGWB可能成为研究通货膨胀时期产生的SGWB的前景。结合NDAF中微子背景和NDAFs产生的SGWB，可以限制CCSNe和NDAFs的属性。 <div>
We investigate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs) based on the results of our fallback core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations. We find that the predicted SGWB is mainly determined by the typical CCSN initial explosion energy and progenitor metallicity. For the optimistic cases in which the typical initial explosion energy is low, the SGWB from NDAFs without disk outflows might be detected by next-generation space-based interferometers such as DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory and Big Bang Observer. In the low-frequency regime ∼10−3–10−1 Hz, this background is comparable to that expected from standard inflationary models. Therefore, the SGWB from NDAFs may become a foreground for research of the SGWB generated in the inflationary epoch. Combining the diffuse NDAF neutrino background and SGWB from NDAFs, one may constrain the properties of the CCSNe and NDAFs.

总结: <br />
JWST使用MIRI和NIRCam仪器对磁星4U 0142+61进行了观测。结果显示该磁星的光谱可以用吸收功率模型描述，不支持之前基于Spitzer光度提出的被动盘模型。研究者认为这些发现可能是由于非热源和观测时间的变化。另外，JWST的观测结果与NuSTAR的硬X射线光谱比较显示，X射线和红外非热发射可能来自磁星磁层中的不同区域。 <div>
JWST observed the magnetar 4U 0142+61 with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) and Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) instruments within a 77 minute time interval on 2022 September 20–21. The low-resolution MIRI spectrum and NIRCam photometry show that the spectrum in the wavelength range 1.4–11 μm range can be satisfactorily described by an absorbed power-law (PL) model, fν ∝ ν−α, with a spectral slope α = 0.96 ± 0.02, interstellar extinction AV = 3.9 ± 0.2, and normalization f0 = 59.4 ± 0.5 μJy at λ = 8 μm. These observations do not support the passive disk model proposed in 2006 by Wang, Chakrabarty and Kaplan, based on Spitzer photometry, which was interpreted as evidence for a fallback disk from debris formed during the supernova explosion. We suggest a nonthermal origin for this emission and source variability as the most likely cause of discrepancies between the JWST data and other IR-optical observing campaigns. However, we cannot firmly exclude the presence of a large disk with a different dependence of the effective disk temperature on distance from the magnetar. Comparison with the PL fit to the hard X-ray spectrum above 10 keV, measured by the NuSTAR contemporaneously with JWST, shows that the X-ray spectrum is significantly harder. This may imply that the X-ray and IR nonthermal emission come from different sites in the magnetosphere of the magnetar.

<div> 关键词: Lagrangian, Gaussian process, Hubble measurements, ΛCDM, f(Q) parameterization

总结: 
该研究探讨了在引力修正理论中选择Lagrangian函数形式的标准程序的差异增加的问题，并提出了使用高斯过程来消除这一问题的方法。研究使用宇宙年代计和径向宇宙学声学振荡的58个哈勃测量来重建Hubble参数H(z)及其导数和H″(z)，从而在不做任何假设的情况下重建了f(Q)的区域。得到的平均曲线沿着Lambda冷暗物质(ΛCDM)常数在重建区域内呈现二次行为，这促使提出了一个新的f(Q)参数化，即f(Q) = −2Λ + ϵQ2，其中ϵ是一个单一参数，表示与ΛCDM宇宙学的偏差。此外，对比重建区域，探讨了广泛研究的幂律和指数f(Q)模型，并且大大改善了对参数空间的观测分析。此外，直接的哈勃测量以及重建的f(Q)函数使得H0张力得以缓解。 <div>
The increase of discrepancy in the standard procedure to choose the arbitrary functional form of the Lagrangian f(Q) motivates us to solve this issue in modified theories of gravity. In this regard, we investigate the Gaussian process, which allows us to eliminate this issue in an f(Q) model-independent way. In particular, we use the 58 Hubble measurements coming from cosmic chronometers and the radial Baryon acoustic oscillations to reconstruct H(z) and its derivatives and H″(z), which leads us to reconstruct the region of f(Q), without any assumptions. The obtained mean curve along the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) constant in the reconstructed region follows a quadratic behavior. This motivates us to propose a new f(Q) parameterization, i.e., f(Q) = −2Λ + ϵQ2, with the single parameter ϵ, which signifies the deviations from ΛCDM cosmology. Further, we probe the widely studied power-law and exponential f(Q) models against the reconstructed region and can improve the parameter spaces significantly compared with observational analysis. In addition, the direct Hubble measurements, along with the reconstructed f(Q) function, allow the H0 tension to be alleviated.

<div> L dwarfs, retrieval analysis, elemental abundance measurements, K-dwarf, cloud model <br />
总结: 
这是一篇关于对年轻的、多云的红色L矮星进行大气检索分析的文章。研究使用了Brewster检索框架，并对年轻K矮星进行了首次元素丰度测量。研究发现在存在凝结云物种的复杂多云L矮星区域，只有近红外数据时，检索分析变得更加困难。尽管测试了三种不同的热剖面参数化，我们仍然无法约束可靠的丰度测量，因此无法确定碳氧比。然而，数据强烈支持云模型而不是无云模型。无论检查的数据的信噪比如何（CWISER BD+60 1417B的S/N约为10，W0047的S/N约为40），检索约束的困难依然存在。这项工作为检索年轻、低表面重力多云L矮星提供了宝贵的经验教训。这项研究进一步证明了模型中存在信息缺失的现象，并迫切需要JWST来指导和提供这一区域的检索分析。 <br /> <div>
We present an atmospheric retrieval analysis on a set of young, cloudy, red L dwarfs—CWISER J124332.12+600126.2 (BD+60 1417B) and WISEP J004701.06+680352.1 (W0047)—using the Brewster retrieval framework. We also present the first elemental abundance measurements of the young K-dwarf (K0) host star, BD+60 1417, using high-resolution (R = 50,000) spectra taken with the Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument on the Large Binocular Telescope. In the complex cloudy L-dwarf regime the emergence of condensate cloud species complicates retrieval analysis when only near-infrared data are available. We find that for both L dwarfs in this work, despite testing three different thermal profile parameterizations we are unable to constrain reliable abundance measurements and thus the carbon-to-oxygen ratio. While we cannot conclude what the abundances are, we can conclude that the data strongly favor a cloud model over a cloudless model. We note that the difficulty in retrieval constraints persists regardless of the signal-to-noise ratio of the data examined (S/N ∼ 10 for CWISER BD+60 1417B and 40 for WISEP W0047). The results presented in this work provide valuable lessons about retrieving young, low-surface-gravity cloudy L dwarfs. This work provides continued evidence of missing information in models and the crucial need for JWST to guide and inform retrieval analysis in this regime.

在这篇文章中，研究了1 AU处的多种能量粒子强度增强事件。识别为一个包括流界面、正反冲击对和嵌入的太阳圈电流片的共旋相互作用区（CIR）结构。文章指出CIR事件的显著特征是：高能（>1 MeV）离子在CIR结构的反波（RW）/冲击处显示了明显的通量增强，这似乎取决于能量。此外，40.5-520 keV能量范围的电子在通过SI和HCS区域后立即加速，并在RW处仅高能电子（约520 keV）显示出明显的局部通量增强。CIR结构后面是由日冕物质抛射（CME）驱动的快速垂直冲击，观察到低能质子和高能电子的通量显著增强。特别地，210-330 keV质子和180-520 keV电子的通量增加了约2个数量级。文章进一步提出，SI和RW处湍流的增加可能是不同物种观察到的通量增强的重要因素。另外，在RW附近存在离子尺度波动，这表明共振波-粒子相互作用可能是高能质子和离子尺度波之间高效的能量转移器。<br /><br />总结：本文研究了1 AU处CIR结构引起的能量粒子强度增强事件。主要观察到高能离子在反波/冲击处通量增强，与能量相关；低能电子通过SI和HCS区域后立即加速，RW处仅高能电子显示通量增强；CIR结构后面的ICME驱动冲击显著增加了低能质子和高能电子的通量。文章进一步指出SI和RW处湍流的增加可能是不同物种通量增强的重要因素，同时离子尺度波动可能是高能质子和离子间高效能量转移的关键。 <div>
A multispecies energetic particle intensity enhancement event at 1 au is analyzed. We identify this event as a corotating interaction region (CIR) structure that includes a stream interface (SI), a forward-reverse shock pair, and an embedded heliospheric current sheet (HCS). The distinct feature of this CIR event is that (1) the high-energy (>1 MeV) ions show significant flux enhancement at the reverse wave (RW)/shock of the CIR structure, following their passage through the SI and HCS. The flux amplification appears to depend on the energy per nucleon. (2) Electrons in the energy range of 40.5–520 keV are accelerated immediately after passing through the SI and HCS regions, and the flux quickly reaches a peak for low-energy electrons. At the RW, only high-energy electrons (∼520 keV) show significant local flux enhancement. The CIR structure is followed by a fast-forward perpendicular shock driven by a coronal mass ejection (CME), and we observed a significant flux enhancement of low-energy protons and high-energy electrons. Specifically, the 210–330 keV proton and 180–520 keV electron fluxes are enhanced by approximately 2 orders of magnitude. This suggests that the later ICME-driven shock may accelerate particles out of the suprathermal pool. In this paper, we further present that for CIR-accelerated particles, the increase in turbulence power at SI and RWs may be an important factor for the observed flux enhancement in different species. The presence of ion-scale waves near the RW, as indicated by the spectral bump near the proton gyrofrequency, suggests that the resonant wave–particle interaction may act as an efficient energy transferrer between energetic protons and ion-scale waves.

总结:

The radiation mechanism underlying the prompt emission remains unresolved and can be resolved using a systematic and uniform time-resolved spectro-polarimetric study. In this paper, we investigated the spectral, temporal, and polarimetric characteristics of five bright gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) using archival data from AstroSat CZTI, Swift Burst Alert Telescope, and Fermi/GBM. These bright GRBs were detected by CZTI in its first year of operation, and their average polarization characteristics have been published in Chattopadhyay et al. In the present work, we examined the time-resolved (in 100–600 keV) and energy-resolved polarization measurements of these GRBs with an improved polarimetric technique such as increasing the effective area and bandwidth (by using data from low-gain pixels), using an improved event selection logic to reduce noise in the double events and extend the spectral bandwidth. In addition, we also separately carried out detailed time-resolved spectral analyses of these GRBs using empirical and physical synchrotron models. By these improved time-resolved and energy-resolved spectral and polarimetric studies (not fully coupled spectro-polarimetric fitting), we could pin down the elusive prompt emission mechanism of these GRBs. Our spectro-polarimetric analysis reveals that GRB 160623A, GRB 160703A, and GRB 160821A have Poynting flux-dominated jets. On the other hand, GRB 160325A and GRB 160802A have baryonic-dominated jets with mild magnetization. Furthermore, we observe a rapid change in polarization angle by ∼90° within the main pulse of very bright GRB 160821A, consistent with our previous results. Our study suggests that the jet composition of GRBs may exhibit a wide range of magnetization, which can be revealed by utilizing spectro-polarimetric investigations of the bright GRBs.

<div> 双星系统，行星轨道，盘面扭曲，耗散性进动，系统的动力学建模<br />
总结:<br />
这项研究发现了一些行星-双星系统会出现行星轨道与双星轨道在同一平面上的趋势。他们提出了一个耗散性进动的模型，该模型将双星系统在原行星盘阶段的动态与盘面扭曲结合起来，指出了系统如何在受到倾斜双星伴星的影响下逐渐趋于轨道对齐。他们的模型显示，初始方向随机的系统在经历耗散性进动后会更加趋于对齐，并且这一过程还能产生与观测相一致的倾斜分布。研究结果表明，耗散性进动可能在一部分中等宽双星-行星系统的轨道配置中起到重要作用，但可能不是观测到的整体对齐趋势的唯一原因。 <div>
Recent observations have demonstrated that some subsets of even moderately wide-separation planet-hosting binaries are preferentially configured such that planetary and binary orbits appear to lie within the same plane. In this work, we explore dissipation during the protoplanetary disk phase, induced by disk warping as the system is forced into nodal recession by an inclined binary companion as a possible avenue of achieving orbit–orbit alignment. We analytically model the coupled evolution of the disk angular momentum vector and stellar spin vector under the influence of a distant binary companion. We find that a population of systems with random initial orientations can appear detectably more aligned after undergoing dissipative precession, and that this process can simultaneously produce an obliquity distribution that is consistent with observations. While dissipative precession proceeds efficiently in close binaries, favorable system properties (e.g., rout ≳ 100 au, α ≳ 0.05, and/or Mb/M* ≳ 1) are required to reproduce observed alignment trends at wider binary separations ab ≳ 450 au. Our framework further predicts that circum-primary planets in systems with high stellar mass ratios should be preferentially less aligned than planets in equal mass stellar binary systems. We discover tentative evidence for this trend in Gaia DR3 and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data. Our findings suggest that dissipative precession may play a significant role in sculpting orbital configurations in a subset of moderately wide planet-hosting binaries, but is likely not solely responsible for their observed population-level alignment.

<div> gamma-ray bursts, relativistic jet, afterglow, two-component jet, reverse shock<br />电磁爆发、相对论性喷流、余辉、双组分喷流、反冲冲击<br /><br />总结: 本文提出了伽马射线暴余辉的双组分喷流假设，并通过GRB 191221B的观测结果支持了这一假设。光学余辉表现出了一个平台期和陡峭的衰减，这与双组分喷流相互作用产生的特征一致。作者提出了对光学余辉、X射线余辉和射电余辉的解释，表明不同阶段受到不同成分喷流的影响。这一研究为理解伽马射线暴遗留的余辉提供了重要线索。 <div>
The afterglows of gamma-ray bursts are believed to have originated from a relativistic jet, which is driven by the merger of compact binary objects or the core collapse of massive stars. Some of their jets may consist of two components: a faster (but narrower) jet and a slower (but wider) jet. The light curves produced by the interaction between the two-component jet and the surrounding medium typically exhibit a chromatic break in multiple bands. For GRB 191221B, the optical light curve of the afterglow exhibits a plateau from 33 to 143 s, followed by a steeper decay that is consistent with the characteristics of reverse shock from an arbitrarily magnetized ejecta. The flattening at ∼10 ks exhibits chromaticity relative to the X-ray afterglow. We propose that the two-component jet scenario can explain this observational result: For the X-ray afterglow, the narrow jet forward shock is dominated until ∼10 ks, and then both the narrow and wide components contribute comparable flux from the forward shock. For the optical afterglow, the first 2 ks is dominated by the narrow jet reverse shock emission (the plateau from 33 to 143 s is due to the jet being magnetized). Between 2 and 10 ks, the forward shock of the narrow jet dominates the optical afterglow, then transitions to wide component forward shock dominance, causing a chromatic plateau. For radio afterglow, the data are only presented after 105 s, which is dominated by the wide jet forward shock emission.

We present results from the JWST First Reionization Epoch Spectroscopically Complete Observations survey on the star-forming sequence (SFS) of galaxies at 1.0 < z < 1.7, around the peak of the cosmic star formation history. Star formation rates (SFRs) are measured from the redshifted, relatively dust-insensitive Paschen-α emission line, and stellar mass measurements include the F444W (4.4 μm; rest-frame H) band. We find SFRs of galaxies with log(M*/M⊙) > 9.5 that are lower than found in many earlier studies by up to 0.6 dex, but in good agreement with recent results obtained with the Prospector fitting framework. The difference (log(SFR(Paα)-SFR(Prospector)) is −0.09 ± 0.04 dex at 1010−11M⊙. We also measure the empirical relation between Paschen-α luminosity and rest-frame H-band magnitude and find that the scatter is only 0.04 dex lower than that of the SFR–M* relation and is much lower than the systematic differences among relations in the literature due to various methods of converting observed measurements to physical properties. We additionally identify examples of sources—that, with standard cutoffs via the UVJ diagram, would be deemed quiescent—with significant (log(sSFR)> −11 yr−1), typically extended, Paschen-α emission. Our results may be indicative of the potential unification of methods used to derive the SFS with careful selection of star-forming galaxies and independent SFR and stellar mass indicators.

In the era of state-of-the-art space-borne telescopes, high-resolution ground-based observation has emerged as a crucial method for characterizing exoplanets, providing essential insights into their atmospheric compositions. In the optical and near-infrared regions, high-resolution spectroscopy has been powerful for hot Jupiters (HJs) and ultrahot Jupiters (UHJs) during their primary transits, as it can probe molecules with better sensitivity. Here, we focus on a comparative simulation study of WASP-76 b (UHJ) and WASP-77 A b (HJ) for different numbers of transits, utilizing three ground-based spectrographs, GIANO-B (Telescopio Nazionale Galileo), CARMENES (Centro Astronomico Hispano Alemán), and ANDES (European Extremely Large Telescope or E-ELT), with varying instrumental parameters, spectral coverages, and resolutions. We aim to evaluate the feasibility of using the upcoming ground-based E-ELT to probe molecules from planet atmospheres and to show how it surpasses other ground-based observatories in terms of detectability. With the 1D model petitCODE, we have self-consistently simulated the atmospheric pressure–temperature profiles, which are subsequently integrated into the 1D chemical kinetics model, VULCAN, to evolve the atmospheric chemistry. High-resolution spectra are obtained by performing line-by-line radiative transfer using petitRADTRANS. Finally, we use the resulting spectra to assess the detectability ( ) of molecular bands, employing the ground-based noise simulator SPECTR. Utilizing cross-correlation spectroscopy, we have successfully demonstrated the robust consistency between our simulation study and real-time observations for both planets. ANDES excels overall in molecular detection, due to its enhanced instrumental architecture, reinforcing E-ELT’s importance for studying exoplanet atmospheres. Additionally, our theoretical simulations predict the detection of CO, NH3, and H2S in the WASP-76 b atmosphere with > 3.

该研究利用太阳动力学观测卫星的紫外成像观测了太阳耀斑产生的等离子体片的热特性。结果显示，在耀斑产生的等离子体片中存在着高温区域，这些区域具有等温特性，温度保持稳定且与高度无关。这暗示着在磁重联的过程中，存在着平衡的加热和冷却过程，以维持等离子体片的稳定结构。研究还发现，2017年9月10日X8.2级耀斑的等离子体片温度特性与其他情况略有不同，表现出温度随高度增加而降低的特点。总的来说，这些结果揭示了耀斑磁重联时产生的等离子体片具有稳定且均匀的结构。 <div>
The current sheet is an essential feature in solar flares and is the primary site for magnetic reconnection and energy release. Imaging observations feature a long linear structure above the candle-flame-shaped flare loops, which resembles the standard flare model with the current sheet viewed edge-on. We investigate the thermal properties of plasmas surrounding the linear sheet during flares, using EUV observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The differential emission measure analyses show evidence of high temperatures in the plasma sheets (PSs), containing hot emissions from only a narrow temperature range, suggestive of an isothermal feature. The sheet temperature remains constant at different heights above the flare arcade, peaking at around = 7.0–7.1; while the well-studied 2017 September 10 X8.2 flare serves as an exception in that the temperature decreases with increasing height and peaks higher ( = 7.25) during the gradual phase. Most PS cases also hold similar emission measures and thicknesses; while the PS emissions drop exponentially above the flare arcade, the sheet thicknesses show no significant height association as for all the measurements. The characteristics of isothermal and steady temperature suggest balanced heating and cooling processes along the current sheet; in particular, additional heating may exist to compensate for the conductive and radiative cooling away from the reconnection site. Our results suggest a steady and uniform sheet structure in the macroscopic scale that results from flare reconnection.

Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) Q- (40–48 GHz), Ka- (29–37 GHz), K- (18–26 GHz), and X- (8–12 GHz) bands' continuum observations, and the complementary ALMA Bands 3 (∼98 GHz) and 4 (∼145 GHz) observations towards PDS 70. The dusty ring appears azimuthally asymmetric in our ALMA images. We obtained firm detections at Ka and K bands without spatially resolving the source; we obtained a marginal detection at Q band, and no detection at X band. The spectral indices (α) are 5 ± 1 at 33–44 GHz and 0.6 ± 0.2 at 22–33 GHz. At 10–22 GHz, the conservative lower limit of α is 1.7. The 33–44 GHz flux density is likely dominated by the optically thin thermal emission of grown dust with ≳1 mm maximum grain sizes, which may be associated with the azimuthally asymmetric substructure induced by planet–disk interaction. Since PDS 70 was not detected at X band, we found it hard to explain the low spectral index at 22–33 GHz only with free–free emission. Hence, we attribute the dominant emission at 22–33 GHz to the emission of spinning nano-meter-sized dust particles, while free–free emission may partly contribute to emission at this frequency range. In some protoplanetary disks, the emission of spinning nano-meter-sized dust particles may resemble the 20–50 GHz excess in the spectra of millimeter-sized dust. The finding of strong continuum emission of spinning nano-meter-sized particles can complicate the procedure of constraining the properties of grown dust. Future high resolution, multifrequency JVLA/Next Generation Very Large Array and Square Kilometer Array observations may shed light on this issue.

GRB相关光学闪耀和余辉的光变曲线是本文的研究对象。研究使用了Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)观测的8个伽玛射线暴，对其进行了光学闪耀和余辉的特征分析，并利用TESS光变曲线对其中4个射线暴的物理参数进行了约束。同时，提出了一种纠正TESS宇宙射线抑制策略的简单方法，以估计与伽玛射线暴同时发生的光学闪耀的“真实”亮度。文章还强调了TESS的连续广域监测能力，能够有效地识别伽玛射线暴的光学发射并对其进行早期余辉光变曲线的特征刻画。基于Swift和Fermi伽玛射线空间望远镜的经验检测率，预计每年最多有10个伽玛射线暴会出现在TESS的视野内。 <br /><br />总结: 光学闪耀和余辉的研究；通过TESS观测8个伽马射线暴；利用TESS光变曲线对4个射线暴的物理参数进行约束；提出纠正TESS宇宙射线抑制策略的方法；TESS的连续广域监测能力；每年有10个伽玛射线暴可能出现在TESS的视野内。 <div>
Very few detections have been made of optical flashes contemporaneous with prompt high-energy emission from a gamma-ray burst (GRB). In this work, we present and analyze light curves of GRB-associated optical flashes and afterglows from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Our sample consists of eight GRBs with arcsecond-level localizations from the X-Ray Telescope on board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift). For each burst, we characterize the prompt optical emission and any observed afterglow, and constrain physical parameters for four of these bursts using their TESS light curves. This work also presents a straightforward method to correct for TESS's cosmic-ray mitigation strategy on 20 s timescales, which allows us to estimate the “true” brightness of optical flashes associated with prompt GRB emission. We also highlight TESS’s continuous wide-field monitoring capability, which provides an efficient means of identifying optical emission from GRBs and characterizing early time afterglow light curves. Based on empirical detection rates from Swift and the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, up to 10 GRBs per year may fall within the contemporaneous TESS field of view.

<div> 磁场、太阳活动周期、表面流动、磁区、太阳地幔震

总结:<br /><br />研究通过使用日磁图识别的太阳地幔震数据，发现磁区仅对太阳活动纬度范围内的太阳表面流动产生大约1m/s的峰值振幅的影响，这只占已知残余经向或纬向流动变化的一小部分。因此，磁活跃区和一般的紧凑磁浓度可能不是全球流动11年变化的主要来源。研究还发现，约为5×1020 Mx的磁通量是观测到重要流动的阈值。此外，大多数磁区周围的进流被限制在其中心周围10°-12°内，与最近发现的更广泛的进流迹象相反。 <div>
We estimate the contributions to the solar-cycle variation of solar meridional and zonal flows near the surface expected solely from local magnetic regions. Maps of flows near magnetic regions are obtained using helioseismic holography and averaged over ensembles of such regions with similar magnetic flux. These averaged flows are assigned to the positions and times of all magnetic regions identified from daily magnetograms over an 11 yr period. Residuals are obtained after averaging both meridional and zonal-flow components over longitude for each Carrington rotation and subtracting the temporal mean at each latitude. Results indicate that magnetic regions produce solar-cycle variations of both components in the active latitude range with peak amplitudes of about 1 m s−1, which represents only a fraction of the known variations in either the residual zonal or meridional flow with amplitudes around 3 and 5 m s−1, respectively. Thus it is unlikely that active regions, and compact magnetic concentrations in general, are the primary source of the 11 yr variation in these global flows. A threshold magnetic flux of 5 × 1020 Mx, below which no significant flows are observed, is identified as a check on the completeness of the set of magnetic regions. We also find that inflows around most magnetic regions are confined to within 10°–12° of their centers, in contrast with recent evidence of more extended inflows.

<title>Are WASP-107-like Systems Consistent with High-eccentricity Migration?</title>

<div> 高离心率迁移，WASP-107 b，WASP-107 c，Tidal Dissipation，Lidov-Kozai Oscillations
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了WASP-107 b和WASP-107 c的特性以及它们之间的相互关系。WASP-107 b是一个类似木星却密度异常低的行星，它可能在雪线内发生了高离心率迁移。研究表明，这种高离心率迁移可能导致了行星内部加热的大气层和大气侵蚀现象。此外，研究推测目前WASP-107 b和WASP-107 c之间的相互倾斜可能相当大，可以通过未来的Gaia天体测量观测来加以验证。此外，研究还指出高离心率迁移可能适用于其他具有类似轨道结构的行星系统。 <div>
WASP-107 b seems to be a poster child of the long-suspected high-eccentricity migration scenario. It is on a 5.7 day, polar orbit. The planet is Jupiter-like in radius but Neptune-like in mass with exceptionally low density. WASP-107 c is on a 1100 day, e = 0.28 orbit with at least Saturn mass. Planet b may still have a residual eccentricity of 0.06 ± 0.04: the ongoing tidal dissipation leads to the observed internally heated atmosphere and hydrodynamic atmospheric erosion. We present a population synthesis study coupling octupole Lidov–Kozai oscillations with various short-range forces, while simultaneously accounting for the radius inflation and tidal disruption of the planet. We find that a high-eccentricity migration scenario can successfully explain nearly all observed system properties. Our simulations further suggest that the initial location of WASP-107 b at the onset of migration is likely within the snowline (<0.5 au). More distant initial orbits usually lead to tidal disruption or orbit crossing. WASP-107 b most likely lost no more than 20% of its mass during the high-eccentricity migration, i.e., it did not form as a Jupiter-mass object. More vigorous tidally induced mass loss leads to disruption of the planet during migration. We predict that the current-day mutual inclination between the planets b and c is substantial: at least 25°–55°, which may be tested with future Gaia astrometric observations. Knowing the current-day mutual inclination may further constrain the initial orbit of planet b. We suggest that the proposed high-eccentricity migration scenario of WASP-107 may be applicable to HAT-P-11, GJ-3470, HAT-P-18, and GJ-436, which have similar orbital architectures.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究通过测量双黑洞合并的引力波，揭示了双黑洞合并率随红移的演化规律。研究发现，在不同红移下，宇宙中星系的数量密度因其物理特性（如恒星质量和恒星形成速率）而有不同的演化趋势。根据这一发现，我们首先假定双黑洞的宿主星系可以用恒星质量或恒星形成速率加权的星系混合模型来描述，并对来自恒星质量加权样本的合并比例进行了上限估计。然后，我们利用GWTC-3数据约束了一个物理上合理的幂律延迟时间分布模型的参数，并用这个延迟时间模型自洽地跟踪了宇宙机器模拟中的星系，推断了一系列红移下双黑洞的可能宿主星系。我们发现，在红移z=0.21时推断得到的宿主星系的平均恒星形成速率约为0.9太阳质量每年，平均恒星质量约为1.9×10^10太阳质量。此外，我们还提供了宿主星系相关的平均恒星年龄、暗物质晕的质量、半径、固有速度和大尺度偏移分布，以及其B和Ks波段的绝对星等分布。我们的研究结果可用于设计最佳的电磁跟踪策略，并且有助于使用统计暗涌方法来测量宇宙参数。 <div>
Observations of gravitational waves from binary black hole (BBH) mergers have measured the redshift evolution of the BBH merger rate. The number density of galaxies in the Universe evolves differently with redshift based on their physical properties, such as their stellar masses and star formation rates. In this work we show that the measured population-level redshift distribution of BBHs sheds light on the properties of their probable host galaxies. We first assume that the hosts of BBHs can be described by a mixture model of galaxies weighted by stellar mass or star formation rate, and find that we can place upper limits on the fraction of mergers coming from a stellar-mass-weighted sample of galaxies. We then constrain the parameters of a physically motivated power-law delay-time distribution using GWTC-3 data, and self-consistently track galaxies in the UniverseMachine simulations with this delay-time model to infer the probable host galaxies of BBHs over a range of redshifts. We find that the inferred host galaxy distribution at redshift z = 0.21 has a median star formation rate ∼ 0.9 M⊙ yr−1 and a median stellar mass of ∼1.9 × 1010M⊙. We also provide distributions for the mean stellar age, halo mass, halo radius, peculiar velocity, and large-scale bias associated with the host galaxies, as well as their absolute magnitudes in the B and Ks bands. Our results can be used to design optimal electromagnetic follow-up strategies for BBHs, and also to aid the measurement of cosmological parameters using the statistical dark-siren method.

该研究使用来自Gaia E/DR3的OBA恒星样本，利用LAMOST的径向速度和年龄τ，研究了年轻恒星在最初几个轨道周期内的垂直运动。研究构建了一个参数模型，描述了恒星轨道的平均垂直动作Jz随银河中心半径RGC的时间演变。考虑数据不确定性，使用马尔可夫链蒙特卡罗分析约束了模型参数。最佳拟合模型显示，在所有考虑的银河中心半径范围内，垂直动作随年龄呈现明显的线性增加趋势。这种趋势可能是随机散射导致的轨道加热所致，但银河盘的各种动力学因素，例如恒星在弯曲盘中出生，也可能提供了未来可以验证的替代解释。 
<br />总结: 使用Gaia E/DR3和LAMOST数据研究了年轻恒星轨道垂直动作随年龄和银河中心半径变化的模式，认为垂直动作随年龄呈线性增加趋势，可能是由于随机散射导致的轨道加热。但也指出了可能的其他动力学因素，需要未来进一步研究验证。 <div>
Stars in the Galactic disk are born on cold, nearly circular orbits with small vertical excursions. After their birth, their orbits evolve, driven by small- or large-scale perturbations in the Galactic disk’s gravitational potential. Here, we study the vertical motions of young stars over their first few orbital periods, using a sample of OBA stars from Gaia E/DR3, which includes radial velocities and ages τ from LAMOST. We construct a parametric model for the time evolution of the stellar orbits’ mean vertical actions Jz as a function of Galactocentric radius, RGC. Accounting for data uncertainties, we use Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis in annuli of Galactocentric radius (RGC) to constrain the model parameters. Our best-fit model shows a remarkably linear increase of vertical actions with age across all Galactocentric radii examined. Orbital heating by random scattering could offer a straightforward interpretation for this trend. However, various other dynamical aspects of the Galactic disk, such as stars being born in a warped disk, might offer alternative explanations that could be tested in the future.

In the planetary magnetosphere, plasma waves act as the medium for particles to transfer energy. Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, and the giant magnetosphere is full of energetic particles, producing intense radio emissions. When interplanetary shocks in the solar wind interact with the Jovian magnetosphere, magnetospheric conditions change, and the characteristics of Jovian radio emissions show distinct variations accordingly. This study focuses on the morphological characteristics of Jovian broadband kilometric radiation (bKOM) under different magnetospheric conditions, i.e., relaxed and compressed. Using observations from Juno, both the frequency range and duration of Jovian bKOM radio emissions are studied, and we compare their variations during compressed and relaxed magnetospheric conditions. Our results show that under compressed magnetospheric conditions, the observed frequency range of Jovian bKOM generally exceeded 100 kHz, and their duration extended from 0 to 3 hr during uncompressed conditions to about 4–9 hr. The distinct features of radio emissions under different magnetospheric conditions imply that solar wind conditions have important influences on Jovian radio emissions, and thus the radio emissions can be used as a diagnostic tool of solar wind interaction with the Jovian magnetosphere.

<br /><br />总结:
最近的观测发现，地球以外的星球，火星上的电子可以进入地壳磁场，并通过磁漂移运动显示为漂移分散的爆发。然而，这些漂移分散电子的来源和注入地壳磁场的机制仍不清楚。研究团队利用了“火星大气和挥发性物质演化任务”（MAVEN）的数据，并通过测试粒子模拟揭示了这些电子来源于经由开放磁场线注入地壳磁场的沉降电子。这些电子在源位置附近显示为无色散爆发，随着漂移离开源地则呈现为分散的爆发。因此，这些分散电子代表了无色散电子演变的后期阶段。这一演化过程与地球的偶极磁场内观察到的情况非常相似，证实地壳磁场类似于一个微型磁层。 <div>
Mars lacks a global intrinsic dipole field but possesses localized crustal fields, making it unique in the solar system. Recent observations revealed that electrons can be injected into the crustal fields, and exhibit drift-dispersed bursts due to the magnetic drift motion, which are characterized by increases or decreases in energy over time in the energy spectrum. However, the source of the drift-dispersed electrons and the mechanism of their injection into the crustal fields remains unclear. Here, by leveraging data from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN mission, along with test-particle simulations, we reveal that the source of dispersed electrons is the precipitating electrons injected into the crustal fields via open field lines. These electrons display as dispersionless bursts near the source location, and as dispersed bursts as they drift away from the source. Thus, the dispersed electrons represent a later stage in the evolution of dispersionless electrons. This evolutionary process closely mirrors that observed within Earth’s dipole field, affirming that the crustal fields function similarly to a mini-magnetosphere.

We investigate the migration of low-mass protoplanets embedded in dust–gas coupled protoplanetary disks. Linear calculations are performed with respect to the Nakagawa–Sekiya–Hayashi (NSH) equilibrium within a shearing sheet. We find that the dusty quasi-drift mode dominates the dynamical behaviors in close proximity to the protoplanet. This mode exhibits an extremely short radial wavelength, characterized by a dispersion relation of . The emergence of this mode leads to a wake with a short radial length scale ahead of protoplanets, contributing to a positive torque, termed as “streaming torque” (ST). Furthermore, both Lindblad torque and corotation torque are affected by the NSH velocity. The total torque and planetary migration are contingent upon the coupling strength between dust and gas. In most scenarios, ST predominates, inducing outward migration for planets, thereby addressing the issue of rapid inward migration in their formation paradigm.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Doppler beaming effect, induced by the reflex motion of stars, introduces flux modulations and serves as an efficient method to photometrically determine mass functions for a large number of close binary systems, particularly those involving compact objects. In order to convert observed beaming-flux variations into a radial-velocity curve, precise determination of the beaming factor is essential. Previously, this factor was calculated as a constant, assuming a power-law profile for stellar spectra. In this study, we present a novel approach to directly compute this factor. Our new method not only simplifies the computation, especially for blue bands and cool stars, but also enables us to evaluate whether the relationship between beaming flux and radial velocity can be accurately described as linear. We develop a Python code and compute a comprehensive beaming-factor table for commonly used filter systems covering main-sequence, subgiant, and giant stars, as well as hot subdwarf and white dwarf stars. Both the code and our table are archived and publicly available on Zenodo: doi:10.5281/zenodo.13049419.

<title>The Landscape of Thermal Transients from Supernovae Interacting with a Circumstellar Medium</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The interaction of supernova ejecta with a surrounding circumstellar medium (CSM) generates a strong shock, which can convert ejecta kinetic energy into observable radiation. Given the diversity of potential CSM structures (arising from diverse mass-loss processes such as late-stage stellar outbursts, binary interaction, and winds), the resulting transients can display a wide range of light-curve morphologies. We provide a framework for classifying the transients arising from interaction with a spherical CSM shell. The light curves are decomposed into five consecutive phases, starting from the onset of interaction and extending through shock breakout and subsequent shock cooling. The relative prominence of each phase in the light curve is determined by two dimensionless quantities representing the CSM-to-ejecta mass ratio η, and the breakout parameter ξ. These two parameters define four light-curve morphology classes, where each class is characterized by the location of the shock breakout and the degree of deceleration as the shock sweeps up the CSM. We compile analytic scaling relations connecting the luminosity and duration of each light-curve phase to the physical parameters. We then run a grid of radiation hydrodynamics simulations for a wide range of ejecta and CSM parameters to numerically explore the landscape of interaction light curves, and to calibrate and confirm the analytic scalings. We connect our theoretical framework to several case studies of observed transients, highlighting the relevance in explaining slow-rising and superluminous supernovae, fast blue optical transients, and double-peaked light curves.

该研究提出了一种层次贝叶斯流程BP3M，用于测量Hubble Space Telescope（HST）图像和Gaia之间的跨匹配源的位置、视差和恒星固有运动（PM），甚至对于稀疏的场景（每幅图像的N* < 10）。该技术利用Gaia测量的天文测量作为先验来预测HST图像中源的位置，因此能够在不使用背景星系/QSO的情况下将HST图像放入全局参考框架中。通过在佛莱斯和德拉科矮星系中测试公开可用的代码，我们测量了20.5 < G < 21等级的PM，比Gaia DR3单独测量的PM精度中位数提高了8-13倍。我们能够利用合成数据来探讨BP3M天文测量对观测策略的影响，发现了一种在不增加PM不确定性的情况下改善视差和位置精度的最佳策略。在稀疏的COSMOS场景中使用1619幅HST图像（每幅图像中中位数为九个Gaia源），我们测量了2640个16 < G < 21.5等级范围内独特源的BP3M PM，其中25%没有Gaia PM；20.25 < G < 20.75等级的中位BP3M PM不确定性为0.44 mas yr−1，而Gaia的为1.03 mas yr−1；没有Gaia测量PM的源（20.75 < G < 21.5等级）的中位BP3M PM不确定性为1.16 mas yr−1。支持BP3M流程的统计数据是一种将不同图像、时代和望远镜的位置测量方式进行泛化的方法，这允许信息在调查和档案之间共享，实现比每个目录单独获得的更高天文测量精度。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究提出了一种BP3M层次贝叶斯流程，用来测量Hubble Space Telescope（HST）图像和Gaia之间的跨匹配源的位置、视差和恒星固有运动（PM）。该技术在稀疏场景中也能有效工作，并且通过公开可用的代码进行了测试。使用合成数据，发现了一种改善视差和位置精度的最佳策略。在实际场景中的测试证实，BP3M PM的精度要比 Gaia DR3 高出数倍，尤其在一些等级的情况下差异尤为明显。该技术的统计手段可以将不同来源的数据进行统一处理，从而提高了天文测量的精度。 <div>
We present a hierarchical Bayesian pipeline, BP3M, that measures positions, parallaxes, and proper motions (PMs) for cross-matched sources between Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images and Gaia—even for sparse fields (N* < 10 per image)—expanding from the recent GaiaHub tool. This technique uses Gaia-measured astrometry as priors to predict the locations of sources in HST images, and is therefore able to put the HST images onto a global reference frame without the use of background galaxies/QSOs. Testing our publicly available code in the Fornax and Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxies, we measure PMs that are a median of 8–13 times more precise than Gaia DR3 alone for 20.5 < G < 21 mag. We are able to explore the effect of observation strategies on BP3M astrometry using synthetic data, finding an optimal strategy to improve parallax and position precision at no cost to the PM uncertainty. Using 1619 HST images in the sparse COSMOS field (median nine Gaia sources per HST image), we measure BP3M PMs for 2640 unique sources in the 16 < G < 21.5 mag range, 25% of which have no Gaia PMs; the median BP3M PM uncertainty for 20.25 < G < 20.75 mag sources is 0.44 mas yr−1 compared to 1.03 mas yr−1 from Gaia, while the median BP3M PM uncertainty for sources without Gaia-measured PMs (20.75 < G < 21.5 mag) is 1.16 mas yr−1. The statistics that underpin the BP3M pipeline are a generalized way of combining position measurements from different images, epochs, and telescopes, which allows information to be shared between surveys and archives to achieve higher astrometric precision than that from each catalog alone.

这篇文章利用iSHELL进行了Class I和Flat Spectrum源的磁场强度调查。它发现这些源的平均磁场强度与Class II源相似，但平均重力较低。通过恒星演化模型推断，Class I和Flat Spectrum源的年龄较年轻，约为0.6百万年，比Class II星体的约3百万年要年轻。这些结果证实了Class I和Flat Spectrum源在其光球上拥有强磁场，因此很可能通过类似于更进化的T Tauri恒星的磁层吸积盘物质。<br /><br />总结: 这项研究使用iSHELL对Class I和Flat Spectrum源进行了磁场强度调查，发现它们的磁场强度与Class II源相似，但重力较低。通过恒星演化模型推断，Class I和Flat Spectrum源的年龄较年轻，约为0.6百万年，比Class II星体的约3百万年要年轻。这些结果证实了Class I和Flat Spectrum源在其光球上拥有强磁场，因此很可能通过类似于更进化的T Tauri恒星的磁层吸积盘物质。 <div>
We perform the first magnetic field strength survey of Class I and Flat Spectrum (FS) sources using K-band observations with iSHELL. We obtained new observations of 42 Class I and FS sources and additionally included 10 sources from the archive. We detect photospheric lines in 44 of the sources, in addition to Brγ, H2, and CO emission in several objects. We model the photospheric absorption lines of 32 Class I and FS sources and measure their magnetic field strengths, K-band temperatures, gravities, projected rotational velocities, and infrared veiling values. We put the physical properties of Class I and FS sources in context by comparing them to the values derived for a sample of Class II sources. We find that (a) the average magnetic field strength of Class I and FS sources 〈B〉 = 2.0 ± 0.15 kG is consistent with the average magnetic field strength of Class II sources 〈B〉 = 1.8 ± 0.15 kG, and (b) the average gravity of Class I and FS objects is lower than the average gravity of Class II sources , although there is significant overlap between both gravity distributions. Furthermore, using stellar evolutionary models, we deduce that Class I and FS sources have a median age of ∼0.6 Myr, and are, as a group, younger than the Class II stars with a median age of ∼3 Myr. Our results confirm that Class I and FS sources host strong magnetic fields on their photospheres. Thus, it is likely that these sources accrete disk material through a magnetosphere similar to the more evolved T Tauri stars.

<div> 开源工具，吸收线特征，冷气体，模拟研究，吸收线观测

总结:<br /><br />CloudFlex是一个开源工具，用于预测星系暗云中冷气体吸收线的特征，可以根据多个参数设置模拟吸收线的质量、大小和速度分布。使用该工具可以预测在星系周围形成的吸收线分布，得出了一些结论，例如随着云团数密度和复杂结构尺寸的减小，具有相同金属丰度的观测视线中等效宽度小于0.3 Å的出现频率显著增加。这个工具还可以帮助详细约束构成光电离星系周围介质的结构大小和速度分布。 <div>
We present CloudFlex, an open-source tool for predicting absorption-line signatures of cool gas in galaxy halos with small-scale structure. Motivated by analyses of ∼104 K material in hydrodynamical simulations of turbulent, multiphase media, we model cool gas structures as complexes of cloudlets sampled from a power-law distribution of mass with velocities drawn from a turbulent velocity field. The user may specify α, the lower limit of the cloudlet mass distribution ( ), and several other parameters that set the mass, size, and velocity distribution of the complex. This permits investigation of the relation between these parameters and absorption-line observables. As a proof-of-concept, we calculate the Mg iiλ2796 absorption induced by the cloudlets in background quasi-stellar object (QSO) spectra. We demonstrate that, at fixed metallicity, the covering fraction of sight lines with equivalent widths W2796 < 0.3 Å increases significantly with decreasing , cloudlet number density (ncl), and complex size. We then use this framework to predict the halo-scale W2796 distribution around ∼L* galaxies. We show that the observed incidences of W2796 > 0.3 Å sight lines with impact parameters 10 kpc < R⊥ < 50 kpc in projected QSO–galaxy studies are consistent with our model over much of parameter space. However, they are underpredicted by models with and ncl ≥ 0.03 cm−3, in keeping with a picture in which the inner cool circumgalactic medium (CGM) is dominated by numerous low-mass cloudlets (mcl ≲ 100M⊙) with a volume filling factor ≲1%. When used to model absorption-line data sets built from multi-sight line and/or spatially extended background probes, CloudFlex enables detailed constraints on the size and velocity distributions of structures comprising the photoionized CGM.

<div> 高磁化中子星、地壳地震、等离子波动、能量传输、磁层
总结：<br /><br />这项研究模拟了磁星磁层中的相对论等离子波相互作用。磁场弯曲时，观察到阿尔芬波不断转换为快磁声波。转换效率在赤道区域可以高达三倍。阿尔芬波生成的快磁声波频率是其两倍。快磁声波呈周期性地由阿尔芬波转换而成，形成磁层阿尔芬波穿越时间的变化。这种快磁声波尾部携带了大部分（一半）总能量。磁星地壳对“反弹”阿尔芬波的塑性阻尼对快磁声波效率的影响很小。我们讨论了识别出的波动现象对磁星观测的影响。外向的快磁声波可以产生电区，是相干辐射的潜在来源。长波长的快磁声波可能通过光圈外的重连产生快速射电爆发。 <div>
Crustal quakes of highly magnetized neutron stars can disrupt their magnetospheres, triggering energetic phenomena like X-ray and fast radio bursts. Understanding plasma wave dynamics in these extreme environments is vital for predicting energy transport across scales to the radiation length. This study models relativistic plasma wave interaction in magnetar magnetospheres with force-free electrodynamics simulations. For propagation along curved magnetic field lines, we observe the continuous conversion of Alfvén waves to fast magnetosonic (FMS) waves. The conversion efficiency can be up to three times higher when counter-propagating Alfvén waves interact in the equatorial region. Alfvén waves generate FMS waves of twice their frequency during their first crossing of the magnetosphere. After the initial transient burst of FMS waves, Alfvén waves convert to FMS waves periodically, generating variations on timescales of the magnetospheric Alfvén wave crossing time. This decaying FMS wave tail carries a significant portion (half) of the total energy emitted. Plastic damping of “bouncing” Alfvén waves by the magnetar crust has minimal impact on the FMS efficiency. We discuss the implications of the identified wave phenomena for magnetar observations. Outgoing FMS waves can develop electric zones, potential sources of coherent radiation. Long wavelength FMS waves could generate FRBs through reconnection beyond the light cylinder.

1. 通过VLA和ALMA进行了SDSS J090122.37+181432.3的射电观测，得到了1.4 GHz和3 GHz连续谱以及1.2 mm连续谱和CO(7–6)以及C i(3P2→3P1)线的数据。
2. 利用VLA的积分通量密度将射电谱分解为自由—自由（FF）和非热成分，并与红外—射电相关参数一致，进一步得到了不受尘埃消光影响的射电连续谱推导的星形成率（SFR）。
3. 从C i(3P2→3P1)线估算得到了气体质量为（1.2 ± 0.2) × 1011M☉，与先前的CO(1–0)得到的气体质量一致。
4. 利用新的红外和射电连续谱数据来绘制SFR地图，评估了Schmidt-Kennicutt关系在∼kpc尺度上对SFR和气体追踪剂选择的依赖性。
5. 对于像J0901这样的星系，Schmidt-Kennicutt关系的斜率在使用CO(7–6)或C i(3P2→3P1)来追踪气体质量时最为平坦，这表明这些跃迁不适合追踪星系中大多数的分子气体。 <br />
总结:<br />这项研究利用射电和红外观测技术对星系SDSS J090122.37+181432.3进行了详细研究。通过将射电谱分解为不同成分，得到了不受尘埃消光影响的星形成率，并估算了气体质量。研究还评估了SFR和气体追踪剂选择对Schmidt-Kennicutt关系的影响。结果表明，采用不同的SFR追踪剂会得到不同的结果，而CO(7–6)或C i(3P2→3P1)不适合追踪星系中大多数的分子气体。 <div>
We report new radio observations of SDSS J090122.37+181432.3, a strongly lensed star-forming galaxy at z = 2.26. We image 1.4 GHz (L-band) and 3 GHz (S-band) continuum using the Very Large Array (VLA) and 1.2 mm (band 6) continuum with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, in addition to the CO(7–6) and C i(3P2→3P1) lines, all at ≲1.″7 resolution. Based on the VLA integrated flux densities, we decompose the radio spectrum into its free–free (FF) and nonthermal components. The infrared–radio correlation parameter is consistent with expectations for star-forming galaxies. We obtain radio continuum-derived star formation rates (SFRs) that are free of dust extinction, finding , , and from the FF emission, nonthermal emission, and when accounting for both emission processes, respectively, in agreement with previous results. We estimate the gas mass from the C i(3P2→3P1) line as Mgas = (1.2 ± 0.2) × 1011M☉, which is consistent with prior CO(1–0)-derived gas masses. Using our new IR and radio continuum data to map the SFR, we assess the dependence of the Schmidt–Kennicutt relation on choices of SFR and gas tracer for ∼kpc scales. The different SFR tracers yield different slopes, with the IR being the steepest, potentially due to highly obscured star formation in J0901. The radio continuum maps have the lowest slopes and overall fidelity for mapping the SFR, despite producing consistent total SFRs. We also find that the Schmidt–Kennicutt relation slope is flattest when using CO(7–6) or C i(3P2→3P1) to trace gas mass, suggesting that those transitions are not suitable for tracing the bulk molecular gas in galaxies like J0901.

<div> C2H4O2 isomers, abundance ratios, star-forming regions, gas-grain hot-core chemical model, ice-mantle desorption
总结:
C2H4O2异构体在星形成区域的丰度比通常为甲酸甲酯（MF）、乙二醛（GA）和乙酸（AA）的比值约为100:10:1。但最近在NGC 6334I巨大原核团中观察到了一种未能解释的偏离这种关系的现象，其中一些源显示出极端的MF：GA比率，导致不同源之间产生双峰行为，而MF：AA比率保持稳定。研究使用三相气相-颗粒热核化学模型来研究模拟的C2H4O2丰度对大量参数空间的影响。在冰盖解吸附（∼125–160 K)过程中，高气体密度和长时间尺度似乎是高MF:GA比率的物理原因。在这些条件下，GA破坏的主要化学机制是冰面上原子H的快速吸附和反应，使得它没有时间解吸附。 MF和GA在水冰上的不同结合能对表面破坏机制的选择性至关重要。个别MF分子在水分失去时迅速逃逸冰面，而GA滞留并被H破坏。适度提高宇宙射线电离速率可以增加冰中的“复杂有机分子”（COM）产量并增加MF：GA比率，但极端值对气相COMs有破坏性。我们推测，需要极端MF：GA比率的高密度可能是COM由星周盘中脱附的COM主导的排放的证据。 <div>
Gas-phase abundance ratios between C2H4O2 isomers methyl formate (MF), glycolaldehyde (GA), and acetic acid (AA) are typically on the order of 100:10:1 in star-forming regions. However, an unexplained divergence from this neat relationship was recently observed toward a collection of sources in the massive protocluster NGC 6334I; some sources exhibited extreme MF:GA ratios, producing a bimodal behavior between different sources, while the MF:AA ratio remained stable. Here, we use a three-phase gas-grain hot-core chemical model to study the effects of a large parameter space on the simulated C2H4O2 abundances. A combination of high gas densities and long timescales during ice-mantle desorption (∼125–160 K) appears to be the physical cause of the high MF:GA ratios. The main chemical mechanism for GA destruction occurring under these conditions is the rapid adsorption and reaction of atomic H with GA on the ice surfaces before it has time to desorb. The different binding energies of MF and GA on water ice are crucial to the selectivity of the surface destruction mechanism; individual MF molecules rapidly escape the surface when exposed by water loss, while GA lingers and is destroyed by H. Moderately elevated cosmic-ray ionization rates can increase absolute levels of “complex organic molecule” (COM) production in the ices and increase the MF:GA ratio, but extreme values are destructive for gas-phase COMs. We speculate that the high densities required for extreme MF:GA ratios could be evidence of COM emission dominated by COMs desorbing within a circumstellar disk.

总结:
Cepheid AW Per是多重系统中的一个组件，具有长周期轨道。 Griffin的径向速度很好地覆盖了38年的轨道。在Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy阵列的干涉测量显示了长周期轨道。此外，哈勃太空望远镜在紫外线高分辨率光谱中显示，伴星本身也是一个具有几乎相等质量的双星系统。这些数据结合来自Gaia的距离提供了Cepheid（主星）的质量M1 = 6.79 ± 0.85 M⊙。次星的组合质量为MS = 8.79 ± 0.50 M⊙。在大约两年后预计将根据Gaia第四次数据发布改善质量的精度。 <div>
The Cepheid AW Per is a component in a multiple system with a long-period orbit. The radial velocities of Griffin cover the 38 yr orbit well. An extensive program of interferometry with the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy array is reported here, from which the long-period orbit is determined. In addition, a Hubble Space Telescope high-resolution spectrum in the ultraviolet demonstrates that the companion is itself a binary with nearly equal-mass components. These data combined with a distance from Gaia provide a mass of the Cepheid (primary) of M1 = 6.79 ± 0.85 M⊙. The combined mass of the secondary is MS = 8.79 ± 0.50 M⊙. The accuracy of the mass will be improved after the fourth Gaia data release, expected in approximately two years.

The High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Gamma-Ray Observatory, located on the side of the Sierra Negra volcano in Mexico, has been fully operational since 2015. The HAWC collaboration has recently significantly improved their extensive air shower reconstruction algorithms, which has notably advanced the observatory performance. The energy resolution for primary gamma rays with energies below 1 TeV was improved by including a noise-suppression algorithm. Corrections have also been made to systematic errors in direction fitting related to the detector and shower plane inclinations, biases in highly inclined showers, and enhancements to the core reconstruction. The angular resolution for gamma rays approaching the HAWC array from large zenith angles (>37°) has improved by a factor of 4 at the highest energies (>70 TeV) as compared to previous reconstructions. The inclusion of a lateral distribution function fit to the extensive air shower footprint on the array to separate gamma-ray primaries from cosmic-ray ones based on the resulting χ2 values improved the background rejection performance at all inclinations. At large zenith angles, the improvement in significance is a factor of 4 compared to previous HAWC publications. These enhancements have been verified by observing the Crab Nebula, which is an overhead source for the HAWC Observatory. We show that the sensitivity to Crab-like point sources (E−2.63) with locations overhead to 30° zenith is comparable to or less than 10% of the Crab Nebula’s flux between 2 and 50 TeV. Thanks to these improvements, HAWC can now detect more sources, including the Galactic center.

<div> GHZ2/GLASS-z12, 红移 z = 12.34, NIRSpec PRISM, 光谱线, 星系形成 <br />
总结:
该研究通过NIRCam光度测定和NIRSpec PRISM光谱，确认了红移为z = 12.34的GHZ2/GLASS-z12星系的存在。光谱显示出了N iv, C iv, He ii, O iii, C iii, O ii和Ne iii线的探测，并首次在高红移处探测到3133 Å静止波长的O iii Bowen荧光线。在极端C iv发射体类别中，GHZ2因其明显的C iv线和等效宽度（EW）约为46 Å而被归类为极端C iv发射体。GHZ2显示出的UV线等效宽度只在低/中红移处的活动星系核（AGNs）或复合天体中发现。UV线强度比与低金属环境中的AGNs和星际物质形成具有兼容性，使得[Ne iv]/[N iv]比的下限更加支持光致辐射光子的恒星起源。研究者讨论了一种可能的情景，即高电离输出是由低金属环境中形成的恒星所致。他们估计了金属丰度≲0.1 Z/Z⊙，电离参数log U > −2，氮/氧丰度是太阳值的4-5倍，并且碳/氧比例是类似于最近发现的氮增强天体的次太阳值。考虑其丰度模式和高恒星质量密度（104M⊙ pc−2），GHZ2是今天球状星团的祖先的理想形成地点。GHZ2的显着亮度使其成为了解大爆炸后仅360百万年内星系形成物理学的“罗塞塔石”。 <div>
We spectroscopically confirm the MUV = −20.5 mag galaxy GHZ2/GLASS-z12 to be at redshift z = 12.34. The source was selected via NIRCam photometry in GLASS-JWST Early Release Science data, providing the first evidence of a surprising abundance of bright galaxies at z ≳ 10. The NIRSpec PRISM spectrum shows detections of N iv, C iv, He ii, O iii, C iii, O ii, and Ne iii lines and the first detection at high redshift of the O iii Bowen fluorescence line at 3133 Å rest frame. The prominent C iv line with rest-frame equivalent width (EW) ≈ 46 Å puts GHZ2 in the category of extreme C iv emitters. GHZ2 displays UV lines with EWs that are only found in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) or composite objects at low/intermediate redshifts. The UV line-intensity ratios are compatible with both AGNs and star formation in a low-metallicity environment, with the low limit on the [Ne iv]/[N iv] ratio favoring a stellar origin of the ionizing photons. We discuss a possible scenario in which the high ionizing output is due to low-metallicity stars forming in a dense environment. We estimate a metallicity ≲0.1 Z/Z⊙, a high ionization parameter log U > −2, a N/O abundance 4–5 times the solar value, and a subsolar C/O ratio similar to the recently discovered class of nitrogen-enhanced objects. Considering its abundance patterns and the high stellar mass density (104M⊙ pc−2), GHZ2 is an ideal formation site for the progenitors of today's globular clusters. The remarkable brightness of GHZ2 makes it a “Rosetta stone” for understanding the physics of galaxy formation within just 360 Myr after the Big Bang.

<div> 关键词：磁化盘风，非理想磁流体力学，线性摄动理论，对称模式，反对称模式

总结：
磁化盘风和风驱动堆积是原行星盘的重要且受到密切研究的扩散机制，但这些机制的稳定性尚未得到充分研究。本文利用半解析的线性摄动理论，应用非理想磁流体力学，重点关注磁扩散率在盘面到表面变化几个数量级的盘模型。线性模式通过其相对于中平面的对称性加以区分。这些模式具有定性不同的增长率：对称模式几乎总是衰减，而至少一个反对称模式总是具有正增长率。这一增长率随着盘中柱状半径R的增加快速下降，比开普勒角速度更陡，并且在基准盘模型中比例为R-5/2。反对称模式的增长打破了盘赤道平面的反射对称性，甚至在没有霍尔效应的情况下也可能发生。在完全发展的反对称模式发生的盘区域，只出现在盘的一侧的堆积流，而在另一侧只出现盘风。这可能解释一些观察到的原行星盘流的不对称性。 <br /><br /> <div>
Magnetized disk winds and wind-driven accretion are an essential and intensively studied dispersion mechanism of protoplanetary disks (PPDs). However, the stability of these mechanisms has yet to be adequately examined. This paper employs semi-analytic linear perturbation theories under nonideal magnetohydrodynamics, focusing on disk models whose magnetic diffusivities vary by a few orders of magnitude from the disk midplane to its surface. Linear modes are distinguished by their symmetry with respect to the midplane. These modes have qualitatively different growth rates: symmetric modes almost always decay, while at least one antisymmetric mode always has a positive growth rate. This growth rate decreases faster than the Keplerian angular velocity with cylindrical radius R in the disk and scales steeper than R−5/2 in the fiducial disk model. The growth of antisymmetric modes breaks the reflection symmetry across the disk equatorial plane, and may occur even in the absence of the Hall effect. In the disk regions where fully developed antisymmetric modes occur, accretion flows appear only on one side of the disk, while disk winds occur only on the other. This may explain the asymmetry of some observed PPD outflows.

该研究观察了塞弗特1星系Mrk 817，利用哈勃空间望远镜/宇宙起源光谱仪的光谱数据，对其14年的多个时期进行了观测。研究发现，窄的UV吸收线受到X射线遮挡物影响，但其总柱密度在所有时期都没有改变。根据调整后的电离参数，推测出流离子化参数对氢电离辐射通量的变化幅度为log UH = -1.0。吸收流位于距离中心光源不到38秒差距的位置，暗示氢密度高于3000 cm-3。它仅覆盖连续谱发射源而不覆盖宽发射线区域，这表明其横截面尺寸较小，可能是从球形到沿视线延伸的潜在云几何形态。 
<br /><br />总结: 该研究对Seyfert 1星系Mrk 817进行了多波段观测，发现其窄的UV吸收线受到X射线遮挡物的影响，但总柱密度未发生改变。通过调整后的电离参数推测出流离子化参数对氢电离辐射通量变化的影响，同时确定了吸收流的位置和横截面尺寸。 <div>
We observed the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 817 during an intensive multiwavelength reverberation mapping campaign for 16 months. Here, we examine the behavior of narrow UV absorption lines seen in the Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph spectra, both during the campaign and in other epochs extending over 14 yr. We conclude that, while the narrow absorption outflow system (at −3750 km s−1 with FWHM = 177 km s−1) responds to the variations of the UV continuum as modified by the X-ray obscurer, its total column density (log NH = 19.5 cm−2) did not change across all epochs. The adjusted ionization parameter (scaled with respect to the variations in the hydrogen-ionizing continuum flux) is log UH = −1.0 . The outflow is located at a distance smaller than 38 pc from the central source, which implies a hydrogen density of nH > 3000 cm−3. The absorption outflow system only covers the continuum emission source and not the broad emission line region, which suggests that its transverse size is small (< 1016 cm), with potential cloud geometries ranging from spherical to elongated along the line of sight.

这篇文章报告了在哈勃深度空间中，通过AstroSat上的UVIT望远镜的远紫外F154W波段发现了来自大质量相互作用系统的Lyman-continuum (LyC) 光子。通过JWST和哈勃太空望远镜（HST）对该系统的成像显示出可能是一次并合的迹象。特别是，JWST波段的高分辨率成像显示出系统内的红外亮物体在较蓝的HST波段中微弱。来自MUSE-UDF数据的电离气体动力学支持合并假设。我们估计整个系统泄漏了超过8％的电离光子到星际介质中。通过光谱能量分布推导的两个组分的恒星质量表明这是一次质量比为1.13±0.37的主要并合。这一发现暗示了在较高红移时，当主要合并更为频繁时，大质量相互作用系统对宇宙电离预算的潜在贡献。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究使用UVIT望远镜在哈勃深度空间发现了大质量相互作用系统的Lyman-continuum光子，并通过JWST和HST成像得出可能是一次并合的结论。MUSE-UDF数据支持了这一假设，估计整个系统泄漏了超过8％的电离光子到星际介质中。研究还发现这是一次质量比为1.13±0.37的主要合并，暗示了在更高红移时，这类大质量相互作用系统对宇宙电离预算的潜在贡献。 <div>
We report the detection of Lyman-continuum (LyC) photons from a massive interacting system at z = 1.097 in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. The LyC detection is made in the far-ultraviolet F154W band of the UVIT telescope on board AstroSat. Both JWST and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of the system reveal signs that it is a likely merger. In particular, high-resolution imaging in the JWST bands reveals an infrared-luminous object within the system that is faint in the bluer HST bands. The ionized gas kinematics from the MUSE-UDF data supports the merger hypothesis. We estimate that the entire system is leaking more than 8% of its ionizing photons to the intergalactic medium. The spectral-energy-distribution-derived stellar masses of the two components indicate that this is a major merger with a mass ratio of 1.13 ± 0.37. This detection hints at the potential contribution of massive interacting systems at higher redshifts, when major mergers were more frequent, to the ionizing budget of the Universe.

<div> 关键词：星际物质丰度，行星状星云，恒星前身，巨星分支，红巨星分支<br />
<br />总结: 本研究对比了银河系行星状星云（PNe）和它们的恒星前身（红巨星分支和渐近巨星分支，AGB恒星）的元素丰度，以探索并量化由于AGB演化或凝结到颗粒上导致的预期差异。作者通过文献调研获取了星云丰度数据，使用了APOGEE DR 17调查数据作为恒星样本。研究了星云和恒星样本之间共同的元素，即C、N、O、Fe和S。结果表明，PNe中的铁主要被封存在颗粒中，硫也可能轻微耗尽，而氮和碳则富集。这些结果对未来的银河系和外星系研究比较星云和恒星样本将具有重要意义。 <div>
We research the elemental abundances in Galactic planetary nebulae (PNe) compared with those of their stellar progenitors (red giant branch and asymptotic giant branch, AGB, stars), to explore and quantify the expected—i.e., due to AGB evolution or condensation onto grains—differences. We gleaned the current literature for the nebular abundances while we used the APOGEE DR 17 survey data for the stellar sample. We examined the elements in common between the nebular and stellar samples, namely, C, N, O, Fe, and S. We confirm that iron in PNe is mostly entrapped in grains, with an average depletion 〈D[Fe/H]〉 = 1.741 ± 0.486 dex, and we disclose a weak correlation between iron depletion and the [O/H] abundance, D[Fe/H] = (6.6003 ± 2.443) × [O/H] + (1.972 ± 0.199). Sulfur may also be mildly depleted in PNe, with 〈D[S/H]〉 = 0.179 ± 0.291 dex. We also found an indication of nitrogen enrichment for PNe 〈E[N/H]〉 = 0.393 ± 0.421 dex, with maximum enrichment (0.980 ± 0.243) occurring for the PNe whose progenitors have gone through the hot-bottom burning. The carbon enrichment is 〈E[C/H]〉 = 0.337 ± 0.463 dex when measured for the general PN populations. Our results will be relevant for future Galactic and extragalactic studies comparing nebular and stellar samples.

<div> 关键词: Andromeda XIX, Keck II telescope, chemical abundances, tidal stripping, tidal interactions

总结: 
Andromeda XIX是M31的一个异常卫星星系，其光度类似于Sextans等矮球状星系，但空间范围类似于超弥散星系。通过Keck II望远镜上的DEIMOS进行的中分辨率光谱测量，发现Andromeda XIX的金属丰度略高于当今局部星系团矮星系的金属丰度关系。这表明它可能经历了潮汐剥夺。同时，测量的化学丰度还显示出潮汐交互作用可能比星系合并更有可能是其形成的原因。其漫射结构和扰动的动力学特性也支持了这一观点。Overall, 这些研究结果表明了Andromeda XIX的形成可能是由潮汐影响引起的，而非星系合并。<br /><br /> <div>
With a luminosity similar to that of Milky Way dwarf spheroidal systems like Sextans, but a spatial extent similar to that of ultra-diffuse galaxies, Andromeda (And) XIX is an unusual satellite of M31. To investigate the origin of this galaxy, we measure chemical abundances for And XIX derived from medium-resolution (R ∼ 6000) spectra from the Deep Extragalactic Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph on the Keck II telescope. We coadd 79 red giant branch stars, grouped by photometric metallicity, in order to obtain a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio to measure 20 [Fe/H] and [α/Fe] abundances via spectral synthesis. The latter are the first such measurements for And XIX. The mean metallicity we derive for And XIX places it ∼2σ higher than the present-day stellar mass–metallicity relation for Local Group dwarf galaxies, potentially indicating it has experienced tidal stripping. A loss of gas and associated quenching during such a process, which prevents the extended star formation necessary to produce shallow [α/Fe]–[Fe/H] gradients in massive systems, is also consistent with the steeply decreasing [α/Fe]–[Fe/H] trend we observe. In combination with the diffuse structure and disturbed kinematic properties of And XIX, this suggests tidal interactions, rather than galaxy mergers, are strong contenders for its formation.

<div> 光变星，δ Scuti 变星，光度关系，Gaia光度测量仪，旋转

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了δ Scuti变星与光度关系之间的关联，利用了来自NASA的TESS卫星的光变曲线数据以及Gaia光度测量仪的观测数据。通过对接近10万颗恒星的分析，发现大约15,918颗星符合δ Scuti变星的特征。并且在稳定带内的85%的变星被确认为δ Scuti变星，其余可能是混合型或γ Doradus变星。最后，文章还证实了旋转与δ Scuti星的脉动之间存在着相关性。 <div>
δ Scuti variables are found at the intersection of the classical instability strip and the main sequence on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. With space-based photometry providing millions of light curves of A-F type stars, we can now probe the occurrence rate of δ Scuti pulsations in detail. Using the 30 minutes cadence light curves from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite's first 26 sectors, we identify variability in 103,810 stars within 5–24 cycles per day down to a magnitude of T = 11.25. We fit the period–luminosity relation of the fundamental radial mode for δ Scuti stars in the Gaia G band, allowing us to distinguish classical pulsators from contaminants for a subset of 39,367 stars. Out of this subset, over 15,918 are found on or above the expected period–luminosity relation. We derive an empirical red edge to the classical instability strip using Gaia photometry. The center where the pulsator fraction peaks at 50%–70%, combined with the red edge, agrees well with previous work in the Kepler field. While many variable sources are found below the period–luminosity relation, over 85% of sources inside of the classical instability strip derived in this work are consistent with being δ Scuti stars. The remaining 15% of variables within the instability strip are likely hybrid or γ Doradus pulsators. Finally, we discover strong evidence for a correlation between pulsator fraction and spectral line broadening from the Radial Velocity Spectrometer on board the Gaia spacecraft, confirming that rotation has a role in driving pulsations in δ Scuti stars.

在这篇文章中，研究人员利用高分辨率光谱技术在M13和M71星团的恒星中测定了锂的丰度。结果显示，这些星团中未演化的恒星的锂丰度范围相差4倍，这种差异被归因于初始角动量的差异，导致自旋减速、相关混合和锂的破坏。与其他星团中的主序星和转向星的类似结果进行了比较。这些星团的年龄跨度为3亿年，[Fe/H]的范围相差30倍。所有这些星团中未演化的恒星的锂丰度的最大值相同，对应于Li/H = 3.16 × 10−10，而根据氘丰度和Big Bang nucleosynthesis的预测，预期的锂丰度为5.24 × 10−10。<br /><br />总结: 文章研究了在宇宙诞生的前15分钟内产生的原始锂丰度，通过在球状星团中测量锂丰度，发现未演化的恒星的锂丰度存在差异，这被归因于初始角动量的不同导致了自旋减速、混合和锂的破坏。研究结果表明，这些星团中未演化的恒星的最大锂丰度相同，而预期的锂丰度却略高。 <div>
During Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) in the first 15 minutes of the Universe, some 7Li was created along with isotopes of H and He. The determination of that primordial value of Li can help constrain the conditions at that time. The oldest stars with known ages can be found in globular clusters which have well-determined ages through stellar evolution models. High-resolution spectra of Li have been obtained with the Keck I Telescope and HIRES in several unevolved stars in the clusters M13 and M71 with V magnitudes of 17.6–17.9. Abundances of Li have been determined with spectrum synthesis techniques and show a range of a factor of 4. We attribute that spread to differences in initial angular momentum resulting in different amounts of spin-down, related mixing, and destruction of Li. Our results are compared with similar results for main-sequence and turnoff stars in other globular clusters. The range in age of these clusters is 11.2–14.2 Gyr for an age span of 3 Gyr. These clusters range in [Fe/H] from −0.75 to −2.24 corresponding to a factor of 30 in metallicity. The maximum in the Li abundance for these unevolved stars in all eight clusters is the same corresponding to Li/H = 3.16 × 10−10, while the predicted Li abundance, based on the deuterium abundance and the BBN predictions, is 5.24 × 10−10.

<div> 星系、质量、尺寸、红移、近红外<br />
在这项研究中，使用JWST/NIRCam F277W和F444W成像数据，测量了约26,000个具有恒星质量M⋆ > 10^9M⊙的星系的Sérsic profile。发现在近红外的波段下，星系的有效半径普遍小于之前在光学波段下的测量结果，平均偏差为0.14 dex，而这种偏差与红移无显著相关性。星系在近红外的质量-尺寸关系比在光学波段下更为平缓，且在0.5 < z < 2.5的所有红移范围内都如此。此外，星系的尺寸演化规律在近红外与光学波段下基本一致，且具有相似的演化速率。具体来说，对于L*星系，尺寸演化速率为Re ∝ (1 + z)−0.7，对于质量较大的（M⋆ > 10^11M⊙）正在形成星系，则其尺寸演化速率几乎与静止星系相当。此外，质量较小的（M⋆ < 10^10M⊙）静止星系的尺寸演化速度则相当于正在形成星系。总的来说，结果表明过去20年来得出的尺寸演化结论，在使用JWST获得的近红外数据时并未发生根本性改变，这些数据更好地反映了恒星质量分布。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究利用JWST数据测量了近红外范围内约26,000个质量大于10^9M⊙的星系的Sérsic profiles，发现尺寸与质量的关系在近红外波段下比在光学波段下更为平缓，且在当前红移范围内这种情况持续存在。此外，研究还发现星系的尺寸演化规律在近红外与光学波段下基本一致，且有相似的演化速率。 <div>
We present the galaxy stellar mass–size relation in the rest-frame near-IR (1.5 μm) and its evolution with redshift up to z = 2.5. Sérsic profiles are measured for ∼26,000 galaxies with stellar masses M⋆ > 109M⊙ from JWST/NIRCam F277W and F444W imaging provided by the COSMOS-WEB and PRIMER surveys using coordinates, redshifts, colors, and stellar mass estimates from the COSMOS2020 catalog. The new rest-frame near-IR effective radii are generally smaller than previously measured rest-frame optical sizes, on average by 0.14 dex, with no significant dependence on redshift. For quiescent galaxies, this size offset does not depend on stellar mass, but for star-forming galaxies, the offset increases from −0.1 dex at M⋆ = 109.5M⊙ to −0.25 dex at M⋆ > 1011M⊙. That is, we find that the near-IR stellar mass–size relation for star-forming galaxies is flatter in the rest-frame near-IR than in the rest-frame optical at all redshifts 0.5 < z < 2.5. The general pace of size evolution is the same in the near-IR as previously demonstrated in the optical, with slower evolution (Re ∝ (1 + z)−0.7) for L* star-forming galaxies and faster evolution (Re ∝ (1 + z)−1.3) for L* quiescent galaxies. Massive (M⋆ > 1011M⊙) star-forming galaxies evolve in size almost as fast as quiescent galaxies. Low-mass (M⋆ < 1010M⊙) quiescent galaxies evolve as slow as star-forming galaxies. Our main conclusion is that the size evolution narrative as it has emerged over the past two decades does not radically change when accessing the rest-frame near-IR with JWST, a better proxy of the underlying stellar mass distribution.

<div> Event Horizon Telescope, EHT, circular polarization, Sgr A*, M87*

这篇文章主要对通过Event Horizon Telescope（EHT）观测到的Sgr A*和M87*等源的模型进行了研究比较。研究使用了多个波长、分辨率、偏振和时间间隔的观测来约束模型。通过对一个包含各种模型的库进行圆偏振测量对比，发现Atacama大型毫米/亚毫米阵列(ALMA)对Sgr A*的观测结果与所有边缘模型都不一致。在研究Sgr A*的MAD模型中，发现只有指向远离观测者的磁偶极矩模型与ALMA数据一致。此外，还发现在27个通过模型中有26个转向顺时针旋转的快速增长模型。研究还提供了所有模型参数均值、标准差及其趋势的表格。

<br /><br />总结:
1. 通过EHT观测的Sgr A*和M87*等源的模型进行了比较。
2. 使用多种观测数据约束模型，包括波长、分辨率、偏振和时间间隔。
3. ALMA观测结果与边缘模型不一致，MAD模型中只有指向远离观测者的磁偶极矩模型与观测数据一致。

5. 研究提供了所有模型参数均值、标准差及其趋势的表格。 <div>
Models of the resolved Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) sources Sgr A* and M87* are constrained by observations at multiple wavelengths, resolutions, polarizations, and time cadences. In this paper, we compare unresolved circular polarization (CP) measurements to a library of models, where each model is characterized by a distribution of CP over time. In the library, we vary the spin of the black hole, the magnetic field strength at the horizon (i.e., both SANE and magnetically arrested disk or MAD models), the observer inclination, a parameter for the maximum ion–electron temperature ratio assuming a thermal plasma, and the direction of the magnetic field dipole moment. We find that Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of Sgr A* are inconsistent with all edge-on (i = 90°) models. Restricting attention to the MAD models favored by earlier EHT studies of Sgr A*, we find that only models with magnetic dipole moment pointing away from the observer are consistent with ALMA data. We also note that in 26 of the 27 passing MAD models, the accretion flow rotates clockwise on the sky. We provide a table of the means and standard deviations of the CP distributions for all model parameters, along with their trends.

这篇研究对明亮的GRB 231129C进行了详细的时间综合和时间分辨光谱分析。结果显示其具有独特的光谱特征，具有硬低能谱指数(α)和软高能谱指数(β)，类似于GRB 090902B，表明可能主要是热辐射。进一步分析显示92%的光谱指数超过了同步辐射的“死线”，最硬的指数为α∼+0.44。同时，53%的光谱可以很好地符合非耗散光球模型，支持可能起源于非耗散光球。此外，我们观察到光谱指数α与峰值能量Ep与通量之间存在强相关性。对于α−F关系，我们使用F=F0e(3.00±0.10)α来描述，而Ep−F关系需要一个平滑弯曲的幂律函数。基于Hascoët等人和Gao & Zhang提出的框架，研究了这次爆发的射流特性，结果显示这两种方法都支持纯火球模型在较小的初始射流半径下适用于这次GRB。

This study presents detailed time-integrated and time-resolved spectral analysis of the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor observations of the bright GRB 231129C. The results reveal its distinct spectral characteristics, featuring a hard low-energy spectral index (α) and soft high-energy spectral index (β), similar to GRB 090902B, suggesting a possible dominance of thermal emission. Further analysis indicates that 92% of the spectral indices exceed the synchrotron “line of death,” with the hardest index at α ∼ +0.44. Simultaneously, 53% of the spectra can be well fitted by the nondissipative photosphere model, supporting a potential origin from a nondissipative photosphere. Additionally, we observe strong correlations between the spectral index α and peak energy Ep with flux. For the α−F relationship, we employ F = F0e(3.00±0.10)α to describe it, whereas the Ep−F relationship requires a smoothly bending power-law function. Based on the framework proposed by Hascoët et al. and Gao & Zhang, the jet characteristics of this burst were studied, revealing that both methods support the suitability of a pure fireball model for this GRB at small initial jet radii.

<div> M dwarf stars, habitable planets, water loss, super-Earths, planetary mass
<br /><br />总结:
M矮星周围的超级地球可能是宇宙中最常见的适居行星。然而，它们的宜居性受到宿主恒星强烈辐射的威胁，导致水流失并可能导致地表干涸。模拟结果表明，质量为1-8M⊕的地球类行星在M矮星的宜居带中，能量限制性的水流失随着行星质量的增加而减少，而扩散限制性的水流失则随质量增加而增加。初始拥有更多水的行星最终可能成为无暴露大陆的水世界，而初始水更少的行星在5亿年后可能出现地表干涸。此外，更大的行星会在地幔中储存更多的水。处于宜居带内缘的超级地球往往最终成为水世界或干涸的行星，只有初始水储量在一定范围内的情况下才能形成类似地球的地表。 <div>
Super-Earths orbiting M dwarf stars may be the most common habitable planets in the Universe. However, their habitability is threatened by intense irradiation from their host stars, which drives the escape of water to space and can lead to surface desiccation. We present simulation results of a box model incorporating deep-water cycling between interior and atmosphere and water loss to space for terrestrial planets of mass 1–8 M⊕ orbiting in the habitable zone of a late M dwarf. Energy-limited loss decreases with planetary mass, while diffusion-limited loss increases with mass. Depending on where it orbits in the habitable zone, a 1 M⊕ planet that starts with 3–8 Earth Oceans can end up with an Earthlike surface of oceans and exposed continents; for an 8 M⊕ super-Earth, that range is 3–12 Earth Oceans. Planets initialized with more water end up as waterworlds with no exposed continents, while planets that start with less water have desiccated surfaces by 5 Gyr. Since the mantles of terrestrial planets can hold much more water than is currently present in Earth’s atmosphere, none of our simulations result in Dune planets—such planets may be less common than previously thought. Further, more water becomes sequestered within the mantle for larger planets. A super-Earth at the inner edge of the habitable zone tends to end up as either a waterworld or with a desiccated surface; only a narrow range of initial water inventory yields an Earthlike surface.

<div> Parker Solar Probe, Encounter 15, slow-speed solar wind, sub-Alfvénic, coronal heating

总结:<br /><br />在Parker Solar Probe第15次接触期间，观测到了近亚音速和亚阿尔文尼速度的太阳风，具有极端的性质，标志着Parker探测器最深入太阳冠层内部的探测。通过多点观测和宇宙风暴对流分析，确认了这一慢速太阳风是来自活跃区域、持续存在且具有极端空间天气影响潜力的稳定结构。针对该太阳风的湍流分析显示其性质与先前观测到的太阳风相似。因此，这一极端低动压太阳风区间是在至少到达1天文单位距离的大型稳定结构。 <div>
During Parker Solar Probe (Parker) Encounter 15 (E15), we observe an 18 hr period of near-subsonic (MS ∼ 1) and sub-Alfvénic (SA), MA ⋘ 1, slow-speed solar wind from 22 to 15.6 R⊙. As the most extreme SA interval measured to date and skirting the solar wind sonic point, it is the deepest Parker has probed into the formation and acceleration region of the solar wind in the corona. The stream is also measured by Wind and the Magnetosonic Multiscale mission near 1 au at times consistent with ballistic propagation of this slow stream. We investigate the stream source, properties, and potential coronal heating consequences via combining these observations with coronal modeling and turbulence analysis. Through source mapping, in situ evidence, and multipoint arrival time considerations of a candidate coronal mass ejection, we determine the stream is a steady (nontransient), long-lived, and approximately Parker spiral aligned and arises from overexpanded field lines mapping back to an active region. Turbulence analysis of the Elsässer variables shows the inertial range scaling of the z+ mode (f ∼ −3/2) to be dominated by the slab component. We discuss the spectral flattening and difficulties associated with measuring the z− spectra, cautioning against making definitive conclusions from the z− mode. Despite being more extreme than prior SA intervals, its turbulent nature does not appear to be qualitatively different from previously observed streams. We conclude that this extreme low-dynamic-pressure solar wind interval (which has the potential for extreme space-weather conditions) is a large, steady structure spanning at least to 1 au.

<div> 关键词: 涡流、原行星盘、磁场结构、气体动力学、粒子聚集

总结: 
涡流在原行星盘中起着重要作用，对其的存在和程度进行了探讨。研究表明，即使在中心恒星1-30天文单位处，气体湍流可以通过磁场传输角动量。气体速度波动在盘的不同高度呈现不同的范围，且与初始磁场强度有关。然而，湍流速度似乎不强烈依赖于磁场极性，因此对霍尔效应不敏感。盘中面的湍流可以驱动尘埃颗粒达到超过其破碎限的碰撞速度，可能减少了中面粒子聚集的有效性。然而，尚不清楚这种程度的湍流是否在离子化水平较低的盘中持续存在。 <div>
Given the important role turbulence plays in the settling and growth of dust grains in protoplanetary disks, it is crucial that we determine whether these disks are turbulent and to what extent. Protoplanetary disks are weakly ionized near the midplane, which has led to a paradigm in which largely laminar magnetic field structures prevail deeper in the disk, with angular momentum being transported via magnetically launched winds. Yet, there has been little exploration of the precise behavior of the gas within the bulk of the disk. We carry out 3D, local shearing box simulations that include all three low-ionization effects (ohmic diffusion, ambipolar diffusion, and the Hall effect) to probe the nature of magnetically driven gas dynamics 1–30 au from the central star. We find that gas turbulence can persist with a generous yet physically motivated ionization prescription (order unity Elsässer numbers). The gas velocity fluctuations range from 0.03 to 0.09 of the sound speed cs at the disk midplane to ∼cs near the disk surface, and are dependent on the initial magnetic field strength. However, the turbulent velocities do not appear to be strongly dependent on the field polarity, and thus appear to be insensitive to the Hall effect. The midplane turbulence has the potential to drive dust grains to collision velocities exceeding their fragmentation limit, and likely reduces the efficacy of particle clumping in the midplane, though it remains to be seen if this level of turbulence persists in disks with lower ionization levels.

<div> [C ii] 158 μm, quasar, star formation, outflows, ALMA  
总结: 该研究利用ALMA观测了一个z = 6.05的双类星系系统，发现两个暗淡的类星体之间有明亮的[C ii]发射，显示系统中有高达6 × 10^9L⊙的总[C ii]辐射。系统的基于[C ii]的总星形成速率约为550M⊙ yr−1，基于红外辐射的尘埃遮挡星形成速率约为100M⊙ yr−1，气体质量约为10^11M⊙。两个星系的动力学质量分别约为9 × 10^10M⊙和5 × 10^10M⊙。通过[C ii]发现了类星体间的光滑速度梯度，表明它们是一个潮汐相互作用的系统。在C1周围发现了动力学上不同的快速[C ii]成分，显示出约600 km s−1的快速流出。预期的出流质量加载因子介于2-3之间，属于AGN和星暴驱动出流之间的中间水平。文献中的流体动力学模拟预测，这一对星系在合并后将演变成一个光度极高（M1450 ≲ −26 mag），大规模星暴（≳1000 M⊙ yr−1）的类星体，在早期宇宙中属于极端的一种类型。 <div>
We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array [C ii] 158 μm line and underlying far-IR continuum emission observations (0.″57 × 0.″46 resolution) toward a quasar–quasar pair system recently discovered at z = 6.05. The quasar nuclei (C1 and C2) are faint (M1450 ≳ −23 mag), but we detect very bright [C ii] emission bridging the 12 kpc between the two objects and extending beyond them (total luminosity L[C ii] ≃ 6 × 109L⊙). The [C ii]-based total star formation rate of the system is ∼550 M⊙ yr−1 (the IR-based dust-obscured star formation is ∼100 M⊙ yr−1), with a [C ii]-based total gas mass of ∼1011M⊙. The dynamical masses of the two galaxies are large (∼9 × 1010M⊙ for C1 and ∼5 × 1010M⊙ for C2). There is a smooth velocity gradient in [C ii], indicating that these quasars are a tidally interacting system. We identified a dynamically distinct, fast-[C ii] component around C1: detailed inspection of the line spectrum there reveals the presence of a broad-wing component, which we interpret as the indication of fast outflows with a velocity of ∼600 km s−1. The expected mass-loading factor of the outflows, after accounting for multiphase gas, is ≳2 − 3, which is intermediate between AGN-driven and starburst-driven outflows. Hydrodynamic simulations in the literature predict that this pair will evolve to a luminous (M1450 ≲ −26 mag), starbursting (≳1000 M⊙ yr−1) quasar after coalescence, one of the most extreme populations in the early Universe.

<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了在明亮的早期星系中存在的尘埃环绕着的圆盘（CNDs），这些圆盘显示出规则的、动力学冷的分子气体动力学。通过ALMA CO成像和详细的气体动力学建模，确定了多个ETGs的黑洞质量。研究者识别了一组包括26个ETGs的样本，它们具有干净的CO动力学，但之前没有足够高角分辨率的近红外观测数据以减轻在构建恒星亮度模型时的尘埃遮挡问题。他们进行了新的光学和近红外哈勃空间望远镜（HST）图像，补充了存档中的HST数据，并测量了恒星表面亮度分布并使用MGE方法对亮度进行了建模。研究者发现这些CNDs通常在近红外光学上变得光学厚重。此外，他们发现不确定的尘埃对MGE的影响往往在BH质量误差估计中占主导地位。这项工作的延伸将集中在限制CND尘埃衰减上。这些发现将有助于重新审视局部黑洞质量 - 宿主星系比例关系。 <div>
Dusty circumnuclear disks (CNDs) in luminous early-type galaxies (ETGs) show regular, dynamically cold molecular gas kinematics. For a growing number of ETGs, Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) CO imaging and detailed gas-dynamical modeling facilitate moderate-to-high precision black hole (BH) mass (MBH) determinations. From the ALMA archive, we identified a subset of 26 ETGs with estimated MBH/M⊙ ≳ 108 to a few × 109 and clean CO kinematics but that previously did not have sufficiently high-angular-resolution near-IR observations to mitigate dust obscuration when constructing stellar luminosity models. We present new optical and near-IR Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images of this sample to supplement the archival HST data, detailing the sample properties and data-analysis techniques. After masking the most apparent dust features, we measure stellar surface-brightness profiles and model the luminosities using the multi-Gaussian expansion (MGE) formalism. Some of these MGEs have already been used in CO dynamical modeling efforts to secure quality MBH determinations, and the remaining ETG targets here are expected to significantly improve the high-mass end of the current BH census, facilitating new scrutiny of local BH mass–host galaxy scaling relationships. We also explore stellar isophotal behavior and general dust properties, finding these CNDs generally become optically thick in the near-IR (AH ≳ 1 mag). These CNDs are typically well aligned with the larger-scale stellar photometric axes, with a few notable exceptions. Uncertain dust impact on the MGE often dominates the BH mass error budget, so extensions of this work will focus on constraining CND dust attenuation.

白矮星大约有2%的行星残骸盘可以通过红外过量检测到，其中只有少数盘显示出气体成分，以其近红外钙三重线的双峰辐射为特征。研究发现，大多数白矮星周围的行星残骸盘在3.4和4.5微米处变化较大。通过对维持恒定位置的3.4微米光线曲线的变化进行分析发现，大多数带有钙发射的残骸盘都非常变化，这进一步证实了具有气态碎片的盘是最具碰撞活跃性的。我们生成了一个包含104个高置信度近红外变量白矮星的目录，并进行了七个新候选3.4微米变量的近红外光谱跟踪，至少证实了一个新的残留行星系统，这表明经验性近红外变化可以成为发现具有气体发射的残骸盘的一种引擎。 <br /><br />总结: 白矮星中大约有2%的行星残骸盘显示出红外过量，其中仅有少数显示出气体成分。通过分析3.4微米光线曲线的变化发现，大多数带有钙发射的残骸盘都非常变化，这证实了具有气态碎片的盘是最具碰撞活跃性的。我们生成了一个包含104个高置信度近红外变量白矮星的目录，并进行了七个新候选3.4微米变量的近红外光谱跟踪，至少证实了一个新的残留行星系统，这表明经验性近红外变化可以成为发现具有气体发射的残骸盘的一种引擎。 <div>
Roughly 2% of white dwarfs harbor planetary debris disks detectable via infrared excesses, but only a few percent of these disks show a gaseous component, distinguished by their double-peaked emission at the near-infrared calcium triplet. Previous studies found that most debris disks around white dwarfs are variable at 3.4 and 4.5 μm, but they analyzed only a few of the now 21 published disks showing calcium emission. To test if most published calcium emission disks exhibit large-amplitude stochastic variability in the near-infrared, we use light curves generated from the unWISE images at 3.4 μm that are corrected for proper motion to characterize the near-infrared variability of these disks against samples of disks without calcium emission, highly variable cataclysmic variables, and 3215 isolated white dwarfs. We find that most calcium emission disks are extremely variable: 6/11 with sufficient signal-to-noise show high-amplitude variability in their 3.4 μm light curves. These results lend further credence to the notion that disks showing gaseous debris in emission are the most collisionally active. Under the assumption that 3.4 μm variability is characteristic of white dwarfs with dusty debris disks, we generate a catalog of 104 high-confidence near-infrared variable white dwarfs, 84 of which are published as variable for the first time. We do near-infrared spectroscopic follow-up of seven new candidate 3.4 μm variables, confirming at least one new remnant planetary system, and posit that empirical near-infrared variability can be a discovery engine for debris disks showing gaseous emission.

<div> CHIME, FRB, GRB, SGRB, Radio emission
总结:
加拿大氢强度映射实验(CHIME)快速射电爆发(FRB)项目使用CHIME/FRB搜索2018年7月7日至2023年8月3日之间与伽马射线暴(GRB)在时间和空间上(误差不超过1周和3σ)重合的FRB。然而，未发现任何CHIME/FRB候选者与所有1σ定位误差<1°的GRB同时发生。在此基础上，使用CHIME/FRB对27个与CHIME/FRB子午线在17°内的短伽马射线暴(SGRBs)的可能FRB-like射电发射进行了限制。其中，两个SGRBs，GRB 210909A和GRB 230208A，在它们的高能辐射发生时正好在CHIME的地平线以上，我们对它们同时FRB-like射电发射进行了一些首次约束。尽管这两个SGRBs都没有已知的红移，但我们根据它们的高能辐射和推导的SGRB能量分布构建了一个红移范围。对于GRB 210909A，这个红移范围对应于z=[0.009，1.64]，平均z=0.13。因此，对于GRB 210909A，在高能辐射的时刻，我们将射电亮度限制为L<2×1046 erg s−1，L<5×1044 erg s−1，和L<3×1042 erg s−1，分别假设红移为z=0.85，z=0.16和z=0.013。我们将这些约束与不同紧凑天体并合模型对射电亮度的预测进行了比较。 <div>
We use the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) Fast Radio Burst (FRB) Project to search for FRBs that are temporally and spatially coincident with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) occurring between 2018 July 7 and 2023 August 3. We do not find any temporal (within 1 week) and spatial (within overlapping 3σ localization regions) coincidences between any CHIME/FRB candidates and all GRBs with 1σ localization uncertainties <1°. As such, we use CHIME/FRB to constrain the possible FRB-like radio emission for 27 short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) that were within 17° of CHIME/FRB’s meridian at a point either 6 hr prior up to 12 hr after the high-energy emission. Two SGRBs, GRB 210909A and GRB 230208A, were above the horizon at CHIME at the time of their high-energy emission and we place some of the first constraints on simultaneous FRB-like radio emission from SGRBs. While neither of these two SGRBs have known redshifts, we construct a redshift range for each GRB based on their high-energy fluence and a derived SGRB energy distribution. For GRB 210909A, this redshift range corresponds to z = [0.009, 1.64] with a mean of z = 0.13. Thus, for GRB 210909A, we constrain the radio luminosity at the time of the high-energy emission to L < 2 × 1046 erg s−1, L < 5 × 1044 erg s−1, and L < 3 × 1042 erg s−1 assuming redshifts of z = 0.85, z = 0.16, and z = 0.013, respectively. We compare these constraints with the predicted simultaneous radio luminosities from different compact object merger models.

<div> 快速射电暴，磁层，反常康普顿散射，Alfvén波，重复射电暴<br />
总结:<br />
本文研究了快速射电暴（FRBs）的时间、频谱和偏振特性，指出大多数爆发的射电辐射可能是在其中央引擎（可能是一个磁星）的磁层内产生的。文章提出了一种通过低频X模电磁波（快磁声波）的相干逆康普顿散射（ICS）产生FRB的观点，并给出了以下发现：（1）在爆发事件期间，地壳振荡会激发千赫兹的Alfvén波。快磁声波可能直接在较大的半径处产生，其频率与Alfvén波几乎相同，并具有足够大的振幅来通过ICS过程为FRB提供动力。（2）截面随半径迅速增加，可在r≳100R⋆处发生显著的ICS，发射功率远大于曲率辐射功率，但仍处于线性散射状态。（3）低频快磁声波可以自然地重新分布充满涡动的相对论等离子体，在电荷稀疏区形成适当大小的束团，从而为FRB提供动力。（4）所需束团净电荷密度可以低于Goldreich-Julian值，这允许强平行电场加速电荷，维持束团，并持续为FRB辐射提供动力。（5）这个模型可以解释重复快速射电暴爆发的多种观测特性，包括高度线偏振和圆偏振以及窄谱线。 <div>
Growing observations of temporal, spectral, and polarization properties of fast radio bursts (FRBs) indicate that the radio emission of the majority of bursts is likely produced inside the magnetosphere of its central engine, likely a magnetar. We revisit the idea that FRBs are generated via coherent inverse Compton scattering (ICS) off low-frequency X-mode electromagnetic waves (fast magnetosonic waves) by bunches at a distance of a few hundred times the magnetar radius. The following findings are revealed: (1) Crustal oscillations during a flaring event would excite kHz Alfvén waves. Fast magnetosonic waves with essentially the same frequency can be generated directly or be converted from Alfvén waves at a large radius, with an amplitude large enough to power FRBs via the ICS process. (2) The cross section increases rapidly with radius and significant ICS can occur at r ≳ 100R⋆ with emission power much greater than the curvature radiation power but still in the linear scattering regime. (3) The low-frequency fast magnetosonic waves naturally redistribute a fluctuating relativistic plasma in the charge-depleted region to form bunches with the right size to power FRBs. (4) The required bunch net charge density can be sub-Goldreich–Julian, which allows a strong parallel electric field to accelerate the charges, maintain the bunches, and continuously power FRB emission. (5) This model can account for a wide range of observed properties of repeating FRB bursts, including high degrees of linear and circular polarization and narrow spectra as observed in many bursts from repeating FRB sources.

太阳耀斑是太阳活动的重要现象，然而关于耀斑过程中元素丰度变化的研究仍然不足。本研究利用嫦娥二号月球探测器获取的太阳X射线监测数据，对太阳活跃区AR 11149和11158的两次耀斑进行了全面的软X射线光谱观测，揭示了不同条件下元素丰度随时间的变化。研究发现铁元素在耀斑过程中呈现出了反向第一电离势效应，硅元素也表现出了该效应。此外，在耀斑减弱阶段观察到了元素丰度稀缺的现象，标志着第二电离势效应的存在。研究还提出了一个基于CSHKP模型的解释，阐明了耀斑动力学中FIP和IFIP效应的形成，同时还将惰性效应引入了ponderomotive力分馏模型中。 <div>
Understanding how elemental abundances evolve during solar flares helps shed light on the mass and energy transfer between different solar atmospheric layers. However, prior studies have mostly concentrated on averaged abundances or specific flare phases, leaving a gap in exploring the comprehensive observations throughout the entire flare process. Consequently, investigations into this area are relatively scarce. Exploiting the Solar X-Ray Monitor data obtained from the Chang’E-2 lunar orbiter, we present two comprehensive soft X-ray spectroscopic observations of flares in active regions, AR 11149 and 11158, demonstrating elemental abundance evolutions under different conditions. Our findings unveil the inverse first ionization potential (IFIP) effect during flares for Fe for the first time, and reaffirm its existence for Si. Additionally, we observed a rare depletion of elemental abundances, marking the second IFIP effect in flare decay phases. Our study offers a CSHKP model-based interpretation to elucidate the formation of both the FIP and IFIP effects in flare dynamics, with the inertia effect being incorporated into the ponderomotive force fractionation model.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章报告了一个独特的事件，展示了C9.1级耀斑期间耀斑环的长时准周期强度震荡和带状亚结构的准周期滑动运动。耀斑环的高温环根植于带状直部显示出“明亮-暗淡”强度震荡，周期约为4.5分钟。与此同时，带状尖端内的亚结构在1400 Å图像上显示出沿着带状的准周期滑动运动，周期与耀斑环直部的静止强度震荡相似。文章指出，这种准周期模式可能与由重联流出影响耀斑环的环顶动力学有关。 <div>
Quasiperiodic oscillations in solar-flaring emission have been observed over the past few decades. To date, the underpinning processes resulting in the quasiperiodic oscillations remain unknown. In this paper, we report a unique event that exhibits both the long-duration quasiperiodic intensity oscillations of flare loops and the quasiperiodic slipping motion of ribbon substructures during a C9.1-class flare (SOL2015-03-15-T01:15), using the observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph. The high-temperature flare loops rooted in the straight part of ribbons display a “bright–dim” intensity oscillation, with a period of about 4.5 minutes. The oscillation starts just after the flare onset and lasts over 3 hr. Meanwhile, the substructures within the ribbon tip display the quasiperiodic slipping motion along the ribbon at 1400 Å images, which has a similar periodicity to the stationary intensity oscillation of the flare loops in the straight part of the flare ribbons. We suggest that the quasiperiodic pattern is probably related to the loop-top dynamics caused by the reconnection outflow impinging on the flare loops.

The detections of Lyα emission in galaxies with redshifts above 5 are of utmost importance for constraining the cosmic reionization timeline, yet such detections are usually based on slit spectroscopy. Here we investigate the significant bias induced by slit placement on the estimate of Lyα escape fraction ( ) by presenting a galaxy (dubbed A2744-z6Lya) at z = 5.66, where its deep JWST/NIRSpec prism spectroscopy completely misses the strong Lyα emission detected in the MUSE data. A2744-z6Lya exhibits a pronounced UV continuum with an extremely steep spectral slope of , and it has a stellar mass of ∼108.75M⊙, a star formation rate of ∼5.95 M⊙ yr−1, and a gas-phase metallicity of . The observed flux and rest-frame equivalent width of its Lyα from MUSE spectroscopy are 1.2 × 10−16 erg s−1 cm−2 and 75 Å, equivalent to . However, its Lyα nondetection from JWST NIRSpec gives a 5σ upper limit of <5%, in stark contrast to that derived from MUSE. To explore the reasons for this bias, we perform spatially resolved stellar population analysis of A2744-z6Lya using the JWST NIRCam and HST imaging data to construct 2D maps of star formation rate, dust extinction, and neutral hydrogen column density. We find that the absence of Lyα in the slit regions probably stems from both the resonance scattering effect of neutral hydrogen and dust extinction. Through analyzing an extreme case in detail, this work highlights the important caveat of inferring from slit spectroscopy, particularly when using the JWST multiplexed NIRSpec microshutter assembly.

Reconstruction of the point-spread function (PSF) plays an important role in many areas of astronomy, including photometry, astrometry, galaxy morphology, and shear measurement. The atmospheric and instrumental effects are the two main contributors to the PSF, both of which may exhibit complex spatial features. Current PSF reconstruction schemes typically rely on individual exposures, and their ability to reproduce the complicated features of the PSF distribution is therefore limited by the number of stars. Interestingly, in conventional methods, after stacking the model residuals of the PSF ellipticities and (relative) sizes from a large number of exposures, one can often observe some stable and nontrivial spatial patterns on the entire focal plane, which could be quite detrimental to, e.g., weak-lensing measurements. These PSF residual patterns are caused by instrumental effects, as they consistently appear in different exposures. Taking this as an advantage, we propose a multilayer PSF reconstruction method to remove such PSF residuals, the second and third layers of which make use of all available exposures together. We test our method on the i-band data of the second release of the Hyper Suprime-Cam. Our method successfully eliminates most of the PSF residuals. Using the Fourier_Quad shear measurement method, we further test the performance of the resulting PSF fields on shear recovery using the field distortion effect. The PSF residuals have strong correlations with the shear residuals, and our new multilayer PSF reconstruction method can remove most of such systematic errors related to the PSF, leading to much smaller shear biases.

The detection of O- and B-type stars with extremely low-mass companions is very important for understanding the formation and evolution of binary stars. However, finding them remains a challenge because the low-mass components in such systems contribute such small flux to the total. During our search for pulsations among O- and B-type stars using the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data, we found two short-period and B-type (B9) eclipsing binaries with orbital periods of 1.61613 and 2.37857 days. Photometric solutions of the two close binaries were derived by analyzing the TESS light curves with the Wilson–Devinney method. It is discovered that both of them are detached binaries with extremely low mass ratios of 0.067(2) for TIC 260342097 and 0.140(3) for TIC 209148631. The determined mass ratio indicates that TIC 260342097 is one of the lowest mass ratios among known B-type binary systems. We showed that the two systems have total eclipses with a broad and flat secondary minimum, suggesting that the photometric parameters could be derived reliably. The absolute parameters of the two binaries are estimated and it is found that the secondary components in the two systems are overluminous and oversize when compared with the normal low-mass and cool main-sequence (MS) stars. These findings may imply that the two systems are composed of a B-type MS primary and a cool pre-MS secondary with orbital periods shorter than 2.5 days. They are valuable targets to test theories of binary star formation and evolution.

这篇文章介绍了Picard–Lefschetz理论在波动光学效应方面的应用，特别是在天体物理学中的透镜效应中的应用。它提出了波动光学下的透镜图像概念的概括性扩展，包括“虚像”和Lefschetz拇指的概念。研究了“Stokes现象”作为Lefschetz拇指拓扑结构的变化，与传统的焦散现象类似，Stokes线标志着有效虚像数量的突变。对一些透镜模型进行了Stokes线的映射，结果显示了Stokes线-焦散网络的独特特征。Stokes现象的可观测特征是干涉行为的改变，尤其是某些Stokes线上频率振荡的出现。此外，还展示了高阶Stokes现象，系统具有连续数量的有效图像，但它们与Lefschetz拇指的连接方式却突变。完整的特征描述需要类比于焦散的灾变理论。 <br /><br />总结: 这篇文章介绍了在天体物理学中透镜效应的波动光学理论框架下的研究，包括Picard–Lefschetz理论的应用和Stokes现象在该框架下的作用。文章提出了透镜图像概念的扩展，研究了Stokes现象的特征和可观测特征，这对于理解天体物理中的透镜效应具有重要意义。 <div>
As lensing of coherent astrophysical sources, e.g., pulsars, fast radio bursts, and gravitational waves, becomes observationally relevant, the mathematical framework of Picard–Lefschetz theory has recently been introduced to fully account for wave optics effects. Accordingly, the concept of lensing images has been generalized to include complex solutions of the lens equation referred to as “imaginary images,” and more radically, to the Lefschetz thimbles, which are a sum of the steepest descent contours connecting the real and imaginary images in the complex domain. In this wave-optics-based theoretical framework of lensing, we study the “Stokes phenomena” as the change of the topology of the Lefschetz thimbles. Similar to the well-known caustics at which the number of geometric images changes abruptly, the corresponding Stokes lines are the boundaries in the parameter space where the number of effective imaginary images changes. We map the Stokes lines for a few lens models. The resulting Stokes line-caustics network represents a unique feature of the lens models. The observable signature of the Stokes phenomena is the change of interference behavior, in particular the onset of frequency oscillation for some Stokes lines. We also demonstrate high-order Stokes phenomena where the system has a continuous number of effective images but with an abrupt change in the way they are connected to each other by the Lefschetz thimbles. Their full characterization calls for an analogy of the catastrophe theory for caustics.

Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) play a pivotal role in influencing small-scale fluctuations within the primordial density field, thereby enhancing the matter power spectrum within the context of the ΛCDM model at small scales. These amplified fluctuations accelerate the early formation of galactic halos and stars, which can be observed through advanced high-redshift observational techniques. Therefore, stellar mass density (SMD) observations, which provide significant opportunities for detailed studies of galaxies at small scales and high redshifts, offer a novel perspective on small-scale cosmic phenomena and constrain the characteristics of PMFs. In this study, we compile 14 SMD data points at redshifts z > 6 and derive stringent constraints on the parameters of PMFs, which include the amplitude of the magnetic field at a characteristic scale of λ = 1 Mpc, denoted as B0, and the spectral index of the magnetic field power spectrum, nB. At 95% confidence level, we establish upper limits of B0 < 4.44 nG and nB < −2.24, along with a star formation efficiency of approximately . If we fix nB at specific values, such as −2.85, −2.9, and −2.95, the 95% upper limits for the amplitude of the magnetic field can be constrained to 1.33, 2.21, and 3.90 nG, respectively. Finally, we attempt to interpret recent early observations provided by the James Webb Space Telescope using the theory of PMFs and find that by selecting appropriate PMF parameters, it is possible to explain these results without significantly increasing the star formation efficiency.

<div> NGC6334I, ALMA, dust emission, magnetic field, high-mass star formation
总结:
NGC6334I是一个以其显著的流量突发事件而闻名的源。通过ALMA的观测，发现其总强度没有实质性变化，而线偏振有轻微的8%变化，暗示了稳定阶段或爆发的结束。从偏振辐射推断出的磁场显示出从西北到东南的主要径向模式，以及对主要核心的复杂扰动，提示螺旋结构的存在。能量分析表明，NGC6334I的流出能量约为3.5 × 10^45 erg，与之前的干涉研究结果相符。采用Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi方法确定的磁场强度区间为1至11 mG，平均为1.9 mG。考虑到Zeeman测量后，平均值增至4 ± 1 mG。而在引力、热和动能地图的比较分析中发现，磁能明显较弱，可能解释了观察到的场形态。此外，发现NGC6334I中的流出和膨胀的HII区域能量也比磁能大，暗示原恒星反馈可能是在我们观测的尺度范围内注入湍动的主要驱动力。文章还指出，NGC6334I中的气体主要表现出超声速和跨阿尔芬速条件，随着气体密度增加逐渐过渡到超阿尔芬速的状态，突显了磁场对气体的影响逐渐减弱。这些观测结果与之前在220 GHz进行的偏振研究相符，丰富了我们对高质量恒星形成区域动态过程的理解。 <div>
We report on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of polarized dust emission at 1.2 mm from NGC6334I, a source known for its significant flux outbursts. Between five months, our data show no substantial change in total intensity and a modest 8% variation in linear polarization, suggesting a phase of stability or the conclusion of the outburst. The magnetic field, inferred from this polarized emission, displays a predominantly radial pattern from northwest to southeast with intricate disturbances across major cores, hinting at spiral structures. Energy analysis of CS (J = 5 → 4) emission yields an outflow energy of approximately 3.5 × 1045 erg, aligning with previous interferometric studies. Utilizing the Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi method, we determined magnetic field strengths ranging from 1 to 11 mG, averaging at 1.9 mG. This average increases to 4 ± 1 mG when incorporating Zeeman measurements. Comparative analyses using gravitational, thermal, and kinetic energy maps reveal that magnetic energy is significantly weaker, possibly explaining the observed field morphology. We also find that the energy in the outflows and the expanding cometary HII region is also larger than the magnetic energy, suggesting that protostellar feedback may be the dominant driver behind the injection of turbulence in NGC6334I at the scales sampled by our data. The gas in NGC6334I predominantly exhibits supersonic and trans-Alfvenic conditions, transitioning towards a super-Alfvenic regime, underscoring a diminished influence of the magnetic field with increasing gas density. These observations are in agreement with prior polarization studies at 220 GHz, enriching our understanding of the dynamic processes in high-mass star-forming regions.

通过对新地平线LORRI图像的分析，得出了宇宙光学背景的强度，采用了16个高银道纬度的观测场，以最小化来自银河系的散射漫射光的影响。该调查得出了宇宙光学背景在0.608μm波长下的强度为11.16 ± 1.65 nW m^-2 sr^-1，其中大部分信号可以由背景星系解释。剩下的部分被归类为异常强度，但与零没有显著差异。这项研究表明，宇宙光学背景完全源自星系。 
<br /><br />总结: 这项研究通过分析新地平线LORRI图像，得出了宇宙光学背景的强度，并发现大部分信号可以由背景星系解释，剩下的异常强度被认为也可能源自星系，指示宇宙光学背景可能完全源自星系。 <div>
We obtained New Horizons LORRI images to measure the cosmic optical background (COB) intensity integrated over 0.4 μm ≲ λ ≲ 0.9 μm. The survey comprises 16 high-Galactic-latitude fields selected to minimize scattered diffuse Galactic light (DGL) from the Milky Way, as well as scattered light from bright stars. This work supersedes an earlier analysis based on observations of one of the present fields. Isolating the COB contribution to the raw total sky levels measured in the fields requires subtracting the remaining scattered light from bright stars and galaxies, intensity from faint stars within the fields fainter than the photometric detection limit, and the DGL foreground. DGL is estimated from 350 μm and 550 μm intensities measured by the Planck High Frequency Instrument, using a new self-calibrated indicator based on the 16 fields augmented with eight additional DGL calibration fields obtained as part of the survey. The survey yields a highly significant detection (6.8σ) of the COB at 11.16 ± 1.65 (1.47 sys, 0.75 ran) nW m−2 sr−1 at the LORRI pivot wavelength of 0.608 μm. The estimated integrated intensity from background galaxies, 8.17 ± 1.18 nW m−2 sr−1, can account for the great majority of this signal. The rest of the COB signal, 2.99 ± 2.03 (1.75 sys, 1.03 ran) nW m−2 sr−1, is formally classified as anomalous intensity but is not significantly different from zero. The simplest interpretation is that the COB is completely due to galaxies.

Soft X-ray transients (SXTs) are a subclass of the low-mass X-ray binaries that occasionally show a sudden rise in their soft X-ray luminosity; otherwise, they remain in an extremely faint state. We investigate the accretion properties of the SXT XTE J1856+053 during its 2023 outburst obtained by NICER and NuSTAR data in July. We present detailed results on the timing and spectral analysis of the X-ray emission during the outburst. The power spectral density shows no quasi-periodic oscillation features. The source’s spectrum on July 19 can be well fitted with a multicolor blackbody component, a power-law component, and a reflection component with a broadened iron emission line. NICER spectra can be well fitted by considering a combination of a blackbody and a power law. The source exhibits a transition within just 5 days from a soft state to an intermediate state during the outburst decline phase. The inner accretion disk has a low inclination angle (∼18°). The spectral analysis also suggests a high-spin (a > 0.9) black hole as the central accreting object.

The origin of strong sodium absorption, which has been observed for a few nearby Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), remains elusive. Here we analyze two high-signal-to-noise, intermediate-resolution Very Large Telescope/X-shooter spectra at epochs +18 and +27 days past peak brightness of the strongly lensed and multiply imaged Type Ia SN 2016geu, which exploded at a redshift of z = 0.4. We show that SN 2016geu exhibits very strong multiple Na i and Ca ii absorption lines with a large total Na i D rest-frame equivalent width (EW) of 5.2 ± 0.2 Å, among the highest ever detected for an SN Ia and similar to only a handful of nearby SNe Ia with extraordinarily large Na i D EWs. The absorption system is time-invariant and extends over a large velocity span ∼250 km s−1. The majority of the absorption is blueshifted relative to the strongest component, while there are both blueshifted and redshifted components relative to the systemic redshift of the galaxy. The column density ratios and widths of the absorption lines indicate that the absorption likely arises from a combination of interstellar dusty molecular clouds and circumgalactic in- and outflowing material rather than circumstellar matter around the supernova.

总结:<br /><br />本文研究了高红移星系中强光谱线的金属丰度指示器的校准，并使用宇宙学模拟中的模拟发射线数据。研究结果表明，我们所研究的12个指标中存在轻微的红移演化，这意味着在模拟中演化的主要物理性质对高红移时期的金属丰度校准产生了可辨认的影响。与詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜的高红移辐射线观测进行比较时，我们发现模型结果与观测结果存在轻微偏差，高红移时的更高电离参数可能是其中一个可能的解释。我们还探讨了驱动强线金属丰度关系形状的物理机制，并提出了迄今未被探索的低金属丰度范围的校准。最后，我们研究了漫射电离气体对总发射线通量的贡献，在z∼0时发现，低电离氧和硫线的漫射电离气体贡献随金属丰度的增加而增加，甚至可能达到70%，这使得在建模星云发射线时包含其贡献至关重要。 <div>
The ratios of strong rest-frame optical emission lines are the dominant indicators of metallicities in high-redshift galaxies. Since typical strong-line-based metallicity indicators are calibrated on auroral lines at z = 0, their applicability for galaxies in the distant Universe is unclear. In this paper, we make use of mock emission-line data from cosmological simulations to investigate the calibration of rest-frame optical emission lines as metallicity indicators at high redshift. Our model, which couples the simba cosmological galaxy formation simulation with cloudy photoionization calculations, includes contributions from H ii regions, post-asymptotic-giant-branch stars, and diffuse ionized gas (DIG). We find mild redshift evolution in the 12 indicators that we study, which implies that the dominant physical properties that evolve in our simulations do have a discernible impact on the metallicity calibrations at high redshifts. When comparing our calibrations with high-redshift auroral line observations from the James Webb Space Telescope, we find a slight offset between our model results and the observations and find that a higher ionization parameter at high redshifts can be one of the possible explanations. We explore the physics that drives the shapes of strong-line metallicity relationships and propose calibrations for hitherto unexplored low-metallicity regimes. Finally, we study the contribution of DIG to total line fluxes. We find that the contribution of DIG increases with metallicity at z ∼ 0 for singly ionized oxygen and sulfur lines and can be as high as 70%, making it crucial to include their contribution when modeling nebular emission.

总结:<br />
本研究利用1000万颗红巨星星的化学动力学信息，阐述了银河系经历的三个阶段：无序混沌的原星系，动力学高的老盘，以及动力学冷的年轻盘。高α盘从[Fe/H]≈-1.0开始“加速旋转”，并在较高的金属性显示出更加有序和圆形的轨道。而年轻的低α盘在其金属丰度范围内表现出动力学上的冷状态，且受强烈的径向梯度影响。研究通过TNG50宇宙学模拟发现了与我们银河系动力学演化相匹配的模拟银河。该模拟银河的原星系在早期形成了相对薄而不一致的高α盘，随后被一次富含气体的重大并购所加热和扭曲。该并购提供了大量低金属丰度的气体和角动量，从而随后形成了动力学冷的低α恒星盘。该研究成果为我们对银河系的三阶段形成提供了全天境观的新视角，推动了旋转加速、合并和冷却这三个物理机制的形成。 <div>
We illustrate the formation and evolution of the Milky Way over cosmic time, utilizing a sample of 10 million red giant stars with full chemodynamical information, including metallicities and α-abundances from low-resolution Gaia XP spectra. The evolution of angular momentum as a function of metallicity—a rough proxy for stellar age, particularly for high-[α/Fe] stars—displays three distinct phases: the disordered and chaotic protogalaxy, the kinematically hot old disk, and the kinematically cold young disk. The old high-α disk starts at [Fe/H] ≈ −1.0, “spinning up” from the nascent protogalaxy, and then exhibiting a smooth “cooldown” toward more ordered and circular orbits at higher metallicities. The young low-α disk is kinematically cold throughout its metallicity range, with its observed properties modulated by a strong radial gradient. We interpret these trends using Milky Way analogs from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, identifying one that closely matches the kinematic evolution of our galaxy. This halo’s protogalaxy spins up into a relatively thin and misaligned high-α disk at early times, which is subsequently heated and torqued by a major gas-rich merger. The merger contributes a large amount of low-metallicity gas and angular momentum, from which the kinematically cold low-α stellar disk is subsequently born. This simulated history parallels several observed features of the Milky Way, particularly the decisive Gaia–Sausage–Enceladus merger that likely occurred at z ≈ 2. Our results provide an all-sky perspective on the emerging picture of our galaxy’s three-phase formation, impelled by the three physical mechanisms of spinup, merger, and cooldown.

We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of the [C ii] 158 μm line and the underlying continuum emission of TN J0924−2201, which is one of the most distant known radio galaxies at z > 5. The [C ii] line and 1 mm continuum emission are detected at the host galaxy. The systemic redshift derived from the [C ii] line is z[C II] = 5.1736 ± 0.0002, indicating that the Lyα line is redshifted by a velocity of 1035 ± 10 km s−1, marking the largest velocity offset between the [C ii] and Lyα lines recorded at z > 5 to date. In the central region of the host galaxy, we identify a redshifted substructure of [C ii] with a velocity of 702 ± 17 km s−1, which is close to the C iv line with a velocity of 500 ± 10 km s−1. The position and the velocity offsets align with a model of an outflowing shell structure, consistent with the large velocity offset of Lyα. The nondetection of [C ii] and dust emission from the three CO(1–0)-detected companions indicates their different nature compared to dwarf galaxies, based on the photodissociation region model. Given their large velocity of ∼1500 km s−1, outflowing molecular clouds induced by the active galactic nucleus are the most plausible interpretation, and they may exceed the escape velocity of a 1013M⊙ halo. These results suggest that TN J0924−2201, with ongoing and fossil large-scale outflows, is in a distinctive phase of removing molecular gas from a central massive galaxy in an overdense region in the early Universe. A dusty H i absorber at the host galaxy is an alternative interpretation.

We present observations and analysis of an eruptive M1.5 flare (SOL2014-08-01T18:13) in NOAA active region (AR) 12127, characterized by three flare ribbons, a confined filament between ribbons, and rotating sunspot motions as observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The potential field extrapolation model shows a magnetic topology involving two intersecting quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) forming a hyperbolic flux tube (HFT), which constitutes the fishbone structure for the three-ribbon flare. Two of the three ribbons show separation from each other, and the third ribbon is rather stationary at the QSL footpoints. The nonlinear force-free field extrapolation model implies the presence of a magnetic flux rope (MFR) structure between the two separating ribbons, which was unclear in the observation. This suggests that the standard reconnection scenario for eruptive flares applies to the two ribbons, and the QSL reconnection for the third ribbon. We find rotational flows around the sunspot, which may have caused the eruption by weakening the downward magnetic tension of the MFR. The confined filament is located in the region of relatively strong strapping field. The HFT topology and the accumulation of reconnected magnetic flux in the HFT may play a role in holding it from eruption. This eruption scenario differs from the one typically known for circular ribbon flares, which is mainly driven by a successful inside-out eruption of filaments. Our results demonstrate the diversity of solar magnetic eruption paths that arises from the complexity of the magnetic configuration.

<div> PCA, X-ray variability, δ-type symbiotic binaries, accretion physics, degenerate dwarfs
总结:
本文通过对RT Cru多种X射线数据的主成分分析，揭示了δ型共生双星系统的X射线变化特征。观测显示了RT Cru的X射线光谱在2012年出现了硬化状态转变，且存在小时级的波动。主成分分析显示Chandra HRC-S/LETG和XMM-Newton EPIC-pn数据具有主要的成分，其中可能包含了软过剩的一些变化信号。此外，Suzaku XIS1数据的主要成分包括吸收柱、源连续谱和可能是软波段热等离子体发射的第三个成分。NuSTAR数据的主成分对应于连续谱和可能的发射特征。研究结果表明，Suzaku观测到的光谱硬度转变主要归因于吸收材料和X射线连续谱的变化，而热等离子体发射的一些变化可能导致了闪烁型变化。 <div>
Hard X-ray-emitting (δ-type) symbiotic binaries, which exhibit a strong hard X-ray excess, have posed a challenge to our understanding of accretion physics in degenerate dwarfs. RT Cru, which is a member of the δ-type symbiotics, shows stochastic X-ray variability. Timing analyses of X-ray observations from XMM-Newton and NuSTAR, which we consider here, indicate hourly fluctuations, in addition to a spectral transition from 2007 to a harder state in 2012 seen with Suzaku observations. To trace the nature of X-ray variability, we analyze the multimission X-ray data using principal component analysis (PCA), which determines the spectral components that contribute most to the flickering behavior and the hardness transition. The Chandra HRC-S/LETG and XMM-Newton EPIC-pn data provide the primary PCA components, which may contain some variable emission features, especially in the soft excess. Additionally, the absorbing column (first order with 50%), along with the source continuum (20%), and a third component (9%)—which likely accounts for thermal emission in the soft band—are the three principal components found in the Suzaku XIS1 observations. The PCA components of the NuSTAR data also correspond to the continuum and possibly emission features. Our findings suggest that the spectral hardness transition between the two Suzaku observations is mainly due to changes in the absorbing material and X-ray continuum, while some changes in the thermal plasma emission may result in flickering-type variations.

星系的性质与其所在的暗物质晕的质量和组装历史密切相关。使用半解析模型的模拟数据，研究发现星际介质质量与暗物质组装时间存在重要联系，尤其是在具有活跃中心（蓝组）和不活跃中心（红组）的星系团中。研究者开发了机器学习模型，用于使用模拟数据中的可观测量来估计星系团的暗物质组装时间。他们分别针对蓝组和红组进行了模型训练和验证。最后，他们将训练好的模型应用于SDSS观测数据中，并成功地推导出了每个星系团的暗物质组装历史。这项研究为观测中研究暗物质与星系的联接迈出了重要一步。 <div>
The properties of the galaxies are tightly connected to their host halo mass and halo assembly history. Accurate measurement of the halo assembly history in observation is challenging but crucial to the understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. The stellar-to-halo mass ratio (M*/Mh) for the centrals has often been used to indicate the halo assembly time th,50 of the group, where th,50 is the lookback time at which a halo has assembled half of its present-day virial mass. Using mock data from the semi-analytic models, we find that M*/Mh shows a significant scatter with th,50, with a strong systematic difference between the group with a star-forming central (blue group) and passive central (red group). To improve the accuracy, we develop machine learning models to estimate th,50 for galaxy groups using only observable quantities in the mocks. Since star formation quenching will decouple the co-growth of the dark matter and baryon, we train our models separately for blue and red groups. Our models have successfully recovered th,50, within an accuracy of ∼1.09 Gyr. With careful calibrations of individual observable quantities in the mocks with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) observations, we apply the trained models to the SDSS Yang et al. groups and derive the th,50 for each group for the first time. The derived SDSS th,50 distributions are in good agreement with that in the mocks, in particular for blue groups. The derived halo assembly history, together with the halo mass, make an important step forward in studying the halo–galaxy connections in observation.

<div> 关键词: 太阳风, 地球, 太阳活动区, 日冕孔, 磁力线

总结:
太阳风预测和日冕事件模拟使用27天太阳旋转周期内的光球磁场图。研究发现，如果新的太阳活动区位于地球的经度约135°–180°处，那么对太阳风和日冕孔的影响将几乎可以忽略。然而，如果新的太阳活动区位于太阳边缘附近，可能会对中央经线附近的磁场产生明显影响。当新的太阳活动区和邻近的日冕孔有相反的极性时，可能导致日冕孔部分关闭，产生较慢的太阳风；但如果极性相同，则会增大日冕孔面积，产生更快的太阳风。总的来说，新的太阳活动区主要通过交换再连接来重新分配磁场。 <div>
Solar wind prediction algorithms and simulations of coronal events often employ photospheric field maps that are assembled over a 27 day solar rotation. This has stimulated efforts to update and better synchronize the maps by applying flux transport and including observations of the back side of the Sun. Here, using potential-field source-surface extrapolations, we address the question of how the emergence of a large active region (AR) on the Sun’s farside affects the coronal field and configuration of coronal holes on the Earth-facing side. We find that, if the new AR is located ∼135°–180° in longitude from Earth, the effect on the coronal field and solar wind near the central meridian will be almost negligible. This is because, when sunspot activity is relatively low, the outermost AR loops will become connected to the nearby polar fields; when sunspot activity is high, the newly emerged flux will connect to neighboring ARs. However, large ARs that emerge near the solar limb may sometimes have a significant effect on the field near the central meridian. In particular, a coronal hole having opposite polarity to that of the nearest sector of the AR may partially close down, resulting in slower wind; conversely, if the coronal hole has the same polarity as the facing AR sector, it will tend to increase in areal size, resulting in faster wind. In most cases, the main effect of a new AR will be to redistribute open flux between itself and neighboring coronal holes (including the polar holes) through interchange reconnection.

<div> Tidal disruption events, TDEs, low-mass black holes, X-ray spectroscopy, AT2021ehb
总结:
Tidal disruption events (TDEs)可能探测到宿主星系中未遵循星团或恒星离散关系的低质量黑洞（BH）。X射线光谱学可能可以限制BH质量，并揭示与超Eddington吸积相关的电离流出。我们对TDE AT2021ehb的XMM-Newton X射线观测进行了分析，并发现在大约300天的破坏之后，其软光谱可以用多彩盘黑体和幂律组分的组合来拟合。使用两个适用于TDE的独立盘模型，我们估计BH质量约为M≈105.5M⊙，表明AT2021ehb可能揭示核心BH种群的低质量端。这些模型提供简单而坚固的表征；不需要更复杂的模型，但在数据中等敏感性的情况下提供了重要的背景和警示。如果包括盘反射，盘流量会减少，推断的BH质量约高了0.35 dex。简单的风配方意味着极快的vout=−0.2c流出，并且排除了盘连续组分。假设一个单位填充因子，这样的风意味着瞬时质量流出率。如此高的速率表明超快流出(UFO)的填充因子必须非常低，和/或UFO相位是短暂的。我们讨论了分析的优势和局限性，以及TDE的未来观测途径。 <div>
Tidal disruption events (TDEs) can potentially probe low-mass black holes (BHs) in host galaxies that might not adhere to bulge or stellar-dispersion relationships. At least initially, TDEs can also reveal super-Eddington accretion. X-ray spectroscopy can potentially constrain BH masses, and reveal ionized outflows associated with super-Eddington accretion. Our analysis of XMM-Newton X-ray observations of the TDE AT2021ehb, around 300 days post-disruption, reveals a soft spectrum and can be fit with a combination of multicolor disk blackbody and power-law components. Using two independent disk models with properties suited to TDEs, we estimate a BH mass at M ≃ 105.5M⊙, indicating AT2021ehb may expose the elusive low-mass end of the nuclear BH population. These models offer simple yet robust characterization; more complicated models are not required, but provide important context and caveats in the limit of moderately sensitive data. If disk reflection is included, the disk flux is lower and inferred BH masses are ∼0.35 dex higher. Simple wind formulations imply an extremely fast vout = −0.2c outflow and obviate a disk continuum component. Assuming a unity filling factor, such a wind implies an instantaneous mass outflow rate of . Such a high rate suggests that the filling factor for the ultrafast outflow (UFO) must be extremely low, and/or the UFO phase is ephemeral. We discuss the strengths and limitations of our analysis and avenues for future observations of TDEs.

总结: <br />研究了活跃星系核（AGNs）的宽发射线区域（BLR），发现使用新的技术——速度分辨电离映射，可以发现不对称的BLR结构。通过分析光谱监测数据发现，氢线比例与连续谱呈反相关，与宽发射线速度延迟呈正相关。一些线比例轮廓不符合对称的BLR预期，提示红移和蓝移气体云可能不等距离于超大质量黑洞。这种不对称的几何结构可能代表一种形成痕迹，为AGNs的演化提供新视角，并影响超大质量黑洞质量的测量。 <div>
Broad emission lines of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) originate from the broad-line region (BLR), consisting of dense gas clouds in orbit around an accreting supermassive black hole. Understanding the geometry and kinematics of this region is crucial for gaining insights into the physics and evolution of AGNs. Conventional velocity-resolved reverberation mapping may face challenges in disentangling the degeneracy between intricate motion and geometry of this region. To address this challenge, new key constraints are required. Here, we report the discovery of an asymmetric BLR using a novel technique: velocity-resolved ionization mapping, which can map the distance of emitting gas clouds by measuring Hydrogen line ratios at different velocities. By analyzing spectroscopic monitoring data, we find that the Balmer decrement is anticorrelated with the continuum and correlated with the lags across broad emission line velocities. Some line ratio profiles deviate from the expectations for a symmetrically virialized BLR, suggesting that the redshifted and blueshifted gas clouds may not be equidistant from the supermassive black hole (SMBH). This asymmetric geometry might represent a formation imprint, provide new perspectives on the evolution of AGNs, and influence SMBH mass measurements.

<title>Should Zeros Count? Modeling the Galaxy–Globular Cluster Scaling Relation with(out) Zero-inflated Count Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The scaling relation between the size of a galaxy’s globular cluster (GC) population (NGC) and the galaxy’s stellar mass (M*) is usually described with a continuous, linear model, but in reality it is a count relationship that should be modeled as such. For massive galaxies, a negative binomial (NB) model has been shown to describe the data well, but it is unclear how the scaling relation behaves at low galaxy masses where a substantial portion of galaxies have NGC = 0. In this work, we test the utility of Poisson and NB models for describing the low-mass end of the NGC−M* scaling relation. We introduce the use of zero-inflated versions of these models, which allow for larger zero populations (e.g., galaxies without GCs) than would otherwise be predicted. We evaluate our models with a variety of predictive model comparison methods, including predictive intervals, the leave-one-out cross-validation criterion, and posterior predictive comparisons. We find that the NB model is consistent with our data, but the naive Poisson is not. Moreover, we find that zero inflation of the models is not necessary to describe the population of low-mass galaxies that lack GCs, suggesting that a single formation and evolutionary process acts over all galaxy masses. Under the NB model, there does not appear to be anything unique about the lack of GCs in many low-mass galaxies; they are simply the low-mass extension of the larger NGC−M* scaling relation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report high-precision, multiwavelength linear-polarization observations of the bright B9 (or A0) star ϵ Sagittarii. The polarization shows the distinctive wavelength dependence expected for a rapidly rotating star. Analysis of the polarization data reveals an angular rotation rate ω (=Ω/Ωcrit) of 0.995 or greater, the highest yet measured for a star in our Galaxy. An additional wavelength-independent polarization component is attributed to electron scattering in a low-density, edge-on gas disk that also produces the narrow absorption components seen in the spectrum. Several properties of the star (polarization due to a disk, occasional weak Hα emission, and multiple periodicities seen in space photometry) resemble those of Be stars, but the level of activity in all cases is much lower than that of typical Be stars. The stellar properties are inconsistent with single-rotating-star evolutionary tracks, indicating that it is most likely a product of binary interaction. The star is an excellent candidate for observation by interferometry, optical spectropolarimetry to detect the Öhman effect, and ultraviolet polarimetry, any of which would allow its extreme rotation to be tested and its stellar properties to be refined.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The polarization spectrum, or wavelength dependence of the polarization fraction, of interstellar dust emission provides important insights into the grain alignment mechanism of interstellar dust grains. We investigate the far-infrared polarization spectrum of a realistic simulated high-mass star-forming cloud under various models of grain alignment and emission. We find that neither a homogeneous grain alignment model nor a grain alignment model that includes collisional dealignment is able to produce the falling spectrum seen in observations. On the other hand, we find that a grain alignment model with grain alignment efficiency dependent on local temperature is capable of producing a falling spectrum that is in qualitative agreement with observations of OMC-1. For the model most in agreement with OMC-1, we find no correlation between the temperature and the slope of the polarization spectrum. However, we do find a positive correlation between the column density and the slope of the polarization spectrum. We suggest this latter correlation to be the result of wavelength-dependent polarization by absorption.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The observability of afterglows from binary neutron star mergers occurring within active galactic nuclei (AGN) disks is investigated. We perform 3D GRMHD simulations of a postmerger system and follow the jet launched from the compact object. We use semianalytic techniques to study the propagation of the blast wave powered by the jet through an AGN disk-like external environment, extending to distances beyond the disk scale height. The synchrotron emission produced by the jet-driven forward shock is calculated to obtain the afterglow emission. The observability of this emission at different frequencies is assessed by comparing it to the quiescent AGN emission. In the scenarios where the afterglow could temporarily outshine the AGN, we find that detection will be more feasible at higher frequencies (≳1014 Hz) and the electromagnetic counterpart could manifest as a fast variability in the AGN emission, on timescales less than a day.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTSs) are highly variable stars that possess gas- and dust-rich disks from which planets form. Much of their variability is driven by mass accretion from the surrounding disk, a process that is still not entirely understood. A multiepoch optical spectral monitoring campaign of four CTTSs (TW Hya, RU Lup, BP Tau, and GM Aur) was conducted along with contemporaneous Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UV spectra and ground-based photometry in an effort to determine accretion characteristics and gauge variability in this sample. Using an accretion flow model, we find that the magnetospheric truncation radius varies between 2.5 and 5 R⋆ across all of our observations. There is also significant variability in all emission lines studied, particularly Hα, Hβ, and Hγ. Using previously established relationships between line luminosity and accretion, we find that, on average, most lines reproduce accretion rates consistent with accretion shock modeling of HST spectra to within 0.5 dex. Looking at individual contemporaneous observations, however, these relationships are less accurate, suggesting that variability trends differ from the trends of the population and that these empirical relationships should be used with caution in studies of variability.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To gain a deeper understanding of the intricate process of filament eruption, we present a case study of a filament splitting and erupting by using multiwavelength data of the Solar Dynamics Observatory. It is found that the magnetic reconnection between the filament and the surrounding magnetic loops resulted in the formation of two new filaments, which erupted successively. The observational evidence of magnetic reconnection, such as the obvious brightening at the junction of two different magnetic structures, the appearance of a bidirectional jet, and subsequent filament splitting, were clearly observed. Even though the two newly formed filaments experienced failed eruptions, three obvious dimmings were observed at the footpoints of the filaments during their eruptions. Based on these observations, it is suggested that magnetic reconnection is the trigger mechanism for the splitting of the original filament and the subsequent eruption of the newly formed filaments. Furthermore, the process of filament splitting dominated by magnetic reconnection can shed light on the explanation of double-decker filament formation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the centrifugal acceleration in an axisymmetric pulsar magnetosphere under the ideal MHD approximation. We solve the field-aligned equations of motion for flows inside the current sheet with finite thickness. We find that flows coming into the vicinity of a Y-point become super fast. The centrifugal acceleration takes place efficiently, and most of the Poynting energy is converted into kinetic energy. However, the super-fast flow does not provide enough centrifugal drift current to open the magnetic field. Opening of the magnetic field is possible by the plasmas that are accelerated in the azimuthal direction with a large Lorentz factor in the closed-field region. We find that this acceleration takes place if the field strength increases toward the Y-point from inside. The accelerated plasma is transferred from the closed-field region to the open-field region by magnetic reconnection with plasmoid emission. We also estimate the Lorentz factor to be reached in the centrifugal wind.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the first detection of the ground-state OH emission line at 1612 MHz toward the prototypical carbon-rich planetary nebula (PN) NGC 7027, utilizing the newly installed ultrawideband (UWB) receiver of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). This emission is likely to originate from the interface of the neutral shell and the ionized region. The other three ground-state OH lines at 1665, 1667, and 1721 MHz are observed in absorption and have velocities well matched with that of HCO+ absorption. We infer that the OH absorption is from the outer shell of NGC 7027, although the possibility that they are associated with a foreground cloud cannot be completely ruled out. All the OH lines exhibit a single blueshifted component with respect to the central star. The formation of OH in carbon-rich environments might be via photodissociation-induced chemical processes. Our observations offer significant constraints for chemical simulations, and they underscore the potent capability of the UWB receiver of FAST to search for nascent PNe.

We study the anisotropy of centroid and integrated intensity maps with synthetic observations. We perform postprocess radiative transfer including the optically thick regime that was not covered in Hernández-Padilla et al. We consider the emission in various CO molecular lines that range from optically thin to optically thick (12CO, 13CO, C18O, and C17O). The results for the velocity centroids are similar to those in the optically thin case. For instance, the anisotropy observed can be attributed to the Alfvén mode, which dominates over the slow and fast modes when the line of sight is at a high inclination with respect to the mean magnetic field. A few differences arise in the models with higher opacity, where some dependence on the sonic Mach number becomes evident. In contrast to the optically thin case, maps of integrated intensity become more anisotropic in optically thick lines. In this situation the scales probed are restricted, due to absorption, to smaller scales, which are known to be more anisotropic. We discuss how the sonic Mach number can affect the latter results, with highly supersonic cases exhibiting a lower degree of anisotropy.

Jansky非常大阵列(VLA)对GOODS-N区域进行了首次高分辨率、高频率的射电连续波测量。使用X波段(8-12 GHz)接收器，共耗时380小时观测，获得了平均rms噪声为671 nJy beam−1，角分辨率为0.″22的10 GHz图。同时也生成了角分辨率为1.″0，rms噪声为968 nJy beam−1的低分辨率图。目录中包含了256个射电源的检测信息，其中假源比例为0.75%。通过蒙特卡洛模拟得出了目录的完整性修正。研究发现，在GOODS-N区域的10 GHz射电源计数与数值模拟/模型的预测以及1.4和3 GHz的射电源计数预期大体一致。 <div>
We present the first high-resolution, high-frequency radio continuum survey that fully maps an extragalactic deep field: the 10 GHz survey of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey-North (GOODS-N) field. This is a Large Program of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) that allocated 380 hr of observations using the X-band (8–12 GHz) receivers, leading to a 10 GHz mosaic of the GOODS-N field with an average rms noise σn = 671 nJy beam−1 and angular resolution θ1/2 = 0.″22 across 297 arcmin2. To maximize the brightness sensitivity we also produce a low-resolution mosaic with θ1/2 = 1.″0 and σn = 968 nJy beam−1, from which we derive our master catalog containing 256 radio sources detected with peak signal-to-noise ratio ≥ 5. Radio source size and flux density estimates from the high-resolution mosaic are provided in the master catalog as well. The total fraction of spurious sources in the catalog is 0.75%. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to derive completeness corrections of the catalog. We find that the 10 GHz radio source counts in the GOODS-N field agree, in general, with predictions from numerical simulations/models and expectations from 1.4 and 3 GHz radio counts.

<div> 关键词: 超新星遗迹，各向异性，功率谱，X射线图像，密度估计<br />
总结:<br />
本研究提出了一种通过计算高分辨率图像的功率谱来测量超新星遗迹中各向异性的技术。研究团队通过开发3D流体动力学模型生成合成X射线图像，并从中提取功率谱。这些功率谱展现出在早期时期的小尺度长度上的激增，表明了一种不符合Kolmogorov湍流的趋势，但在后期转变为Kolmogorov湍流。对Tycho超新星遗迹的观测确认了模型的功率谱，并且提供了该遗迹周围气体密度的估计和外部喷射物密度分布的估计。此外，还观察到了大尺度上额外的功率，这可能为爆炸机制本身提供了重要线索。 <div>
Supernova remnants (SNRs) exhibit varying degrees of anisotropy, which have been extensively modeled using numerical methods. We implement a technique to measure anisotropies in SNRs by calculating power spectra from their high-resolution images. To test this technique, we develop 3D hydrodynamical models of SNRs and generate synthetic X-ray images from them. Power spectra extracted from both the 3D models and the synthetic images exhibit the same dominant angular scale, which separates large-scale features from small-scale features due to hydrodynamic instabilities. The angular power spectrum at small length scales during relatively early times is too steep to be consistent with Kolmogorov turbulence, but it transitions to Kolmogorov turbulence at late times. As an example of how this technique can be applied to observations, we extract a power spectrum from a Chandra observation of Tycho’s SNR and compare with our models. Our predicted power spectrum picks out the angular scale of Tycho’s fleecelike structures and also agrees with the small-scale power seen in Tycho. We use this to extract an estimate for the density of the circumstellar gas (n ∼ 0.28 cm−3), consistent with previous measurements of this density by other means. The power spectrum also provides an estimate of the density profile of the outermost ejecta. Moreover, we observe additional power at large scales, which may provide important clues about the explosion mechanism itself.

<br />总结: 该研究利用超级姬巨大望远镜(HSC)和加拿大-法国-夏威夷望远镜大面积U波段深度调查的成像数据结合史隆数字天空调查(SDSS)中的U-dropout星系，研究了红移为z∼3的67个类星体周围的局部密度环境。研究发现，类星体周围的密度分布与U-dropout星系基本一致，有三个类星体与原团块候选体相关。根据宇宙演化模型的研究结果表明，这一时期的类星体位于 typcial mass 的暗物质晕中。此外，研究还调查了当地星系过密度与紫外线亮度、黑洞质量和类星体邻近区域尺寸之间的相关性，但没有发现显著的相关性。最后，研究发现在距离类星体0.51±0.05物理Mpc的地方，暗U-dropout星系的局部密度低于明亮U-dropout星系，其中类星体紫外辐射强度是背景紫外辐射的30倍。研究论证了在紫外辐射强烈的短距离处可能会抑制星系形成，即使是在大质量暗物质晕中也是如此。 <br /> <div>
We examine the local density environments around 67 quasars at z ∼ 3 by combining the imaging data of Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program and Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope Large Area U-band Deep Survey over about 20 deg2. Our measurements exploit U-dropout galaxies in the vicinities of quasars taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that the quasars have an indistinguishable surrounding density distribution from the U-dropout galaxies and that three quasars are associated with protocluster candidates within a projected separation of 3′. According to a halo evolutionary model, our results suggest that quasars at this epoch occupy haloes with a typical mass of . We also investigate the dependence of the local galaxy overdensity on ultraviolet (UV) luminosities, black hole masses, and proximity zone sizes of the quasars, but no statistically significant correlation was found. Finally, we find that the local density of faint U-dropout galaxies are lower than that of bright U-dropout galaxies within a projected distance of 0.51 ± 0.05 physical Mpc, where the quasar UV radiation is 30 times more intense than background UV radiation. We argue that photoevaporation may suppress galaxy formation at short distances where the quasar UV intensity is strong, even in massive haloes.

总结:<br /><br />这项研究使用 CoRoT 空间任务观测了六颗光谱类型为 F 到 M 的恒星，分析了它们的星斑特征和旋转动力学。研究发现，这些恒星的星斑特征与太阳型恒星相似，而且它们的差分旋转随着平均恒星自转周期的增加而减小，这意味着随着恒星老化，其差分旋转减小。此外，这六颗恒星根据星斑通量的不同分为两类，提供了对恒星磁活动的新线索。 <div>
While direct magnetic field measurements are rare for slowly rotating stars, spots observed during planetary transits provide a potential indicator of magnetic activity on stellar surfaces. Moreover, the rotation of the stellar surface can be probed by monitoring the spots’ position with time in subsequent transits. This study investigates the dynamic interplay of rotational shear and stellar rotation rate in six stars of spectral types F to M, all hosting exoplanets observed by the CoRoT space mission, except for one binary star from Kepler. The analysis, facilitated by the ECLIPSE code, unveils the physical properties of stellar spots, including radius, intensity, temperature, and position. The five CoRoT stars exhibit spot characteristics consistent with those observed in solar type stars. The determination of a spot longitude during different transits allows for the inference of the star’s differential rotation profile, revealing a decreasing trend of rotational shear with the mean stellar rotation period, given by . This implies that, at least for slow rotators (mean rotation period >5 days), as stars age, their differential rotation decreases. Additionally, the six stars analyzed here seem to fall into two categories, according to their spot flux deficit: those with ΔFspot > 0.005 and those with ΔFspot < 0.002.

<div> 高质量X射线双星，LS I+61°303，由一个质量巨大的Be星和一个快速旋转的中子星组成。它的光谱能量分布横跨多个波长，被归类为γ射线双星系统。通过对Fermi大面积望远镜观测LS I+61°303的分析，科学家们确认了先前多波段观测中观测到的轨道、超轨道和轨道-超轨道拍频的三个周期性信号，并且发现了一个额外的周期信号。这个新发现的信号表现出大约26.3天的周期，在大约7σ的置信水平下。此外，新信号的功率谱峰随能量范围0.1-0.3、0.3-1.0和1.0-500.0 GeV的增加而逐渐减小。有趣的是，在奥文斯谷无线电天文台40米望远镜的数据中也发现了一个类似周期的信号。研究人员认为，新发现的周期信号可能源自轨道周期和逆行恒星岁差周期之间的耦合关系。<br /><br />总结:
1. LS I+61°303是一个高质量X射线双星系统
2. Fermi大面积望远镜观测确认了多个周期性信号
3. 新发现的周期信号具有26.3天周期，且在不同能量范围内表现出不同的功率谱特征

LS I+61°303 is a high-mass X-ray binary system comprising a massive Be star and a rapidly rotating neutron star. Its spectral energy distribution across multiwavelengths categorizes it as a γ-ray binary system. In our analysis of LS I+61°303 using Fermi Large Area Telescope observations, we not only confirmed the three previously discussed periodicities of orbital, superorbital, and orbital–superorbital beat periods observed in multiwavelength observations, but also identified an additional periodic signal. This newly discovered signal exhibits a period of ∼26.3 days at a ∼7σ confidence level. Moreover, the power spectrum peak of the new signal gradually decreases as the energy increases across the energy ranges of 0.1–0.3, 0.3–1.0, and 1.0–500.0 GeV. Interestingly, a potential signal with a similar period was found in data obtained from the Owens Valley Radio Observatory 40 m telescope. We suggest that the newly discovered periodic signal may originate from a coupling between the orbital period and the retrograde stellar precession period.

Detecting large-scale flux ropes (FRs) embedded in interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) and assessing their geoeffectiveness are essential, since they can drive severe space weather. At 1 au, these FRs have an average duration of 1 day. Their most common magnetic features are large, smoothly rotating magnetic fields. Their manual detection has become a relatively common practice over decades, although visual detection can be time-consuming and subject to observer bias. Our study proposes a pipeline that utilizes two supervised binary classification machine-learning models trained with solar wind magnetic properties to automatically detect large-scale FRs and additionally determine their geoeffectiveness. The first model is used to generate a list of autodetected FRs. Using the properties of the southward magnetic field, the second model determines the geoeffectiveness of FRs. Our method identifies 88.6% and 80% of large-scale ICMEs (duration ≥ 1 day) observed at 1 au by the Wind and the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory missions, respectively. While testing with continuous solar wind data obtained from Wind, our pipeline detected 56 of the 64 large-scale ICMEs during the 2008–2014 period (recall = 0.875), but also many false positives (precision = 0.56), as we do not take into account any additional solar wind properties other than the magnetic properties. We find an accuracy of 0.88 when estimating the geoeffectiveness of the autodetected FRs using our method. Thus, in space-weather nowcasting and forecasting at L1 or any planetary missions, our pipeline can be utilized to offer a first-order detection of large-scale FRs and their geoeffectiveness.

<title>Multivariate Predictors of Lyman Continuum Escape. I. A Survival Analysis of the Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey*</title>

<div> 关键词: galaxies, reionization, Lyman continuum photons, fesc, multivariate predictors<br />
总结: <br />
这篇文章研究了银河系是如何对宇宙进行再电离的，通过开发和分析了对逸出分数（fesc）的新的多变量预测模型，使用了Cox比例风险模型进行预测，发现最重要的预测变量是Lyman系列吸收线的等效宽度（EW）和紫外线尘埃衰减。文章还强调了H i吸收的重要性，特别是对最强的LyC发射体来说。预测模型对于高红移也具有适用性，证实了ΣSFR和[O iii]/[O ii]在预测fesc方面的重要性。总体来说，这些多变量模型为在高红移时预测fesc提供了一个有希望的工具。 <div>
To understand how galaxies reionized the Universe, we must determine how the escape fraction of Lyman continuum (LyC) photons (fesc) depends on galaxy properties. Using the z ∼ 0.3 Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS), we develop and analyze new multivariate predictors of fesc. These predictions use the Cox proportional hazards model, a survival analysis technique that incorporates both detections and upper limits. Our best model predicts the LzLCS fesc detections with an rms scatter of 0.31 dex, better than single-variable correlations. According to ranking techniques, the most important predictors of fesc are the equivalent width (EW) of Lyman-series absorption lines and the UV dust attenuation, which track line-of-sight absorption due to H i and dust. The H i absorption EW is uniquely crucial for predicting fesc for the strongest LyC emitters, which show properties similar to weaker LyC emitters and whose high fesc may therefore result from favorable orientation. In the absence of H i information, star formation rate surface density (ΣSFR) and [O iii]/[O ii] ratio are the most predictive variables and highlight the connection between feedback and fesc. We generate a model suitable for z > 6, which uses only the UV slope, ΣSFR, and [O iii]/[O ii]. We find that ΣSFR is more important in predicting fesc at higher stellar masses, whereas [O iii]/[O ii] plays a greater role at lower masses. We also analyze predictions for other parameters, such as the ionizing-to-nonionizing flux ratio and Lyα escape fraction. These multivariate models represent a promising tool for predicting fesc at high redshift.

Eruptive mass loss of massive stars prior to supernova (SN) explosion is key to understanding their evolution and end fate. An observational signature of pre-SN mass loss is the detection of an early, short-lived peak prior to the radioactive-powered peak in the lightcurve of the SN. This is usually attributed to the SN shock passing through an extended envelope or circumstellar medium. Such an early peak is common for double-peaked Type IIb SNe with an extended hydrogen envelope but uncommon for normal Type Ibc SNe with very compact progenitors. In this paper, we systematically study a sample of 14 double-peaked Type Ibc SNe out of 475 Type Ibc SNe detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility. The rate of these events is ∼3%–9% of Type Ibc SNe. A strong correlation is seen between the peak brightness of the first and the second peak. We perform a holistic analysis of this sample’s photometric and spectroscopic properties. We find that six SNe have ejecta mass less than 1.5 M⊙. Based on the nebular spectra and lightcurve properties, we estimate that the progenitor masses for these are less than ∼12 M⊙. The rest have an ejecta mass >2.4 M⊙ and a higher progenitor mass. This sample suggests that the SNe with low progenitor masses undergo late-time binary mass transfer. Meanwhile, the SNe with higher progenitor masses are consistent with wave-driven mass loss or pulsation-pair instability-driven mass-loss simulations.

Signals generated by dust impacting spacecraft can be detected by electric field instruments. These signals have been simulated by numerous models. However, few models can accurately characterize the expansion of the plasma cloud generated by dust impact. The COMSOL model presented in this paper provides a way to understand the expansion properties of ions and electrons. The model can also be used to analyze the various expected waveforms of dust impact signals as a function of different parameters, such as the spacecraft voltage and the ambient plasma temperature. The results show that close to 50% of ions and electrons in the impact plasma cloud are collected by spacecraft at weak spacecraft potentials and that a fraction of the ions is still collected rather than all of them streaming away from the impact location at VSC > 0 V. The model also confirms that in the expanding plasma cloud, ions are in the form of plumes, while electrons diffuse in an isotropic manner.

Ionization drives important chemical and dynamical processes within protoplanetary disks, including the formation of organics and water in the cold midplane and the transportation of material via accretion and magnetohydrodynamic flows. Understanding these ionization-driven processes is crucial for understanding disk evolution and planet formation. We use new and archival Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of HCO+, H13CO+, and N2H+ to produce the first forward-modeled 2D ionization constraints for the DM Tau protoplanetary disk. We include ionization from multiple sources and explore the disk chemistry under a range of ionizing conditions. Abundances from our 2D chemical models are postprocessed using non-LTE radiative transfer, visibility sampling, and imaging, and are compared directly to the observed radial emission profiles. The observations are best fit by a modestly reduced cosmic-ray ionization rate (ζCR ∼10−18 s−1) and a hard X-ray spectrum (hardness ratio = 0.3), which we associate with stellar flaring conditions. Our best-fit model underproduces emission in the inner disk, suggesting that there may be an additional mechanism enhancing ionization in DM Tau’s inner disk. Overall, our findings highlight the complexity of ionization in protoplanetary disks and the need for high-resolution multiline studies.

总结: <br /><br />这项研究分析了在月球磁层边界出现Kelvin-Helmholtz不稳定性（KHI）的情况，通过对ARTEMIS卫星观测数据的分析发现，KHI的发生率约为15％，低于侧磁层边界的发生率。研究还发现，KHI的发生率随着磁声马赫数、阿尔芬马赫数、太阳风速度和动压的增加而减少，仅与太阳风密度略微正相关。与白昼侧磁层边界不同，在月球距离磁层边界，KHI的发生率随太阳风速度增加而减少。此外，KHI的发生率也随着磁场的振幅减少，并受到磁场方向的影响。根据磁场钟角度的变化，KHI的发生率在钟角度为零时达到最大值，约为24％。这些统计结果基本与目前接受的KHI线性理论一致，为理解磁层边界KHI的激发和演化、尾部磁层边界等离子体输运过程做出了贡献。 <div>
Kelvin–Helmholtz waves can be observed frequently at the near-Earth magnetopause and play an important role in the transport of particles, momentum, and energy from the solar wind to the magnetosphere. This work analyzes the occurrence of Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (KHI) at lunar distance magnetopause, which has not been thoroughly studied currently based on Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence, and Electrodynamics of the Moon's Interaction with the Sun satellite observations, and it also investigates the effect of the upstream solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). Statistical results show that (1) the occurrence rate is about 15% of the time at lunar distance, lower than at the flank magnetopause, and (2) the occurrence rate decreases with the magnetoacoustic Mach number, Alfvén Mach number, solar wind velocity, and dynamic pressure but only shows a slightly positive correlation with solar wind density. Unlike at the dayside magnetopause, the occurrence rate of KHI diminishes as the solar wind velocity increases at the lunar distance magnetopause, and (3) the occurrence rate decreases with IMF amplitude and is influenced by IMF orientation. As a function of the IMF clock angle, the occurrence rate reaches its maximum at ∼24% when the clock angle is zero. The statistical results are basically consistent with the currently accepted linear theory of KHI, except for a lower rate for higher-speed solar wind. This work contributes to understanding the excitation and evolution of KHI along the magnetopause and plasma transport process in the tail magnetopause.

<br />研究团队利用Fermi Large Area Telescope对Cyg X-3的γ射线数据进行建模分析。他们发现该系统的γ射线在高通量时表现出明显的轨道调制特征，这种调制与先前的模型相吻合，可以解释为由喷流中的相对论电子对供体黑体辐射进行非均向康普顿散射所致。然而，他们发现如果喷流与旋转黑洞的自旋轴对齐，将会发生geodetic precession，其周期约为50年，但这一现象在γ和无线电数据中未被观测到。因此，研究团队提出另一种模型，认为喷流的平均方向虽然与轨道对齐，但受到供体恒星风的推力而弯曲，并以轨道周期进行进动。最终的γ射线调制现象则可以解释为自发辐射的多普勒增强效应。尽管该模型也能很好地拟合数据，但拟合的弯曲角却远大于基于当前已知的双星和恒星风参数的理论值。因此，当前的理论模型存在不足之处，需要进一步研究以找到正确的模型。 <br /><br />总结: Fermi Large Area Telescope对Cyg X-3的γ射线数据进行模型分析，发现γ射线表现出轨道调制特征，提出两种模型解释，但存在理论不足，需要进一步研究。 <div>
We model the currently available γ-ray data on Cyg X-3 from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. Thanks to Cyg X-3’s very strong γ-ray activity during 2018–2021, the data quality has significantly improved. We study the strong orbital modulation of the γ-rays observed at high γ-ray fluxes. The modulation, as found earlier, is well modeled by anisotropic Compton scattering of the donor blackbody emission by relativistic electrons in a jet strongly misaligned with respect to the orbital axis. We confirm that this model fits well both the average γ-ray modulation light curve and the spectrum. However, we find that if the jet were aligned with the spin axis of a rotating black hole, it would undergo geodetic precession with a period of ∼50 yr. However, its presence is ruled out by both the γ-ray and radio data. Therefore, we consider an alternative model in which the average jet direction is aligned, but it is bent outside the orbit owing to the thrust of the donor stellar wind, and thus precesses at the orbital period. The γ-ray modulation then appears as a result of the variable Doppler boosting of synchrotron self-Compton jet emission. This model also fits the data well. However, the fitted bending angle is much larger than the theoretical one based on the binary and wind parameters as currently known. Thus, both models disagree with important aspects of our current theoretical understanding of the system. We discuss possible ways to find the correct model.

<br /><br />总结:
这项研究报告了来自脉冲星PSR J1849-0001的脉冲星风星云（PWN）G32.64+0.53可能的GeV γ射线发射。研究利用了Fermi大面积望远镜Pass 8约14.7年的数据进行分析。研究发现，源的位置和光谱与X射线和TeV能量段的相匹配，因此我们认为GeV γ射线源表明了PWN G32.64+0.53。我们使用一个基于时间的单区模型解释了宽频谱能量分布（SED），假设目标源的多波段非热发射是通过电子/正电子的同步辐射和反康普顿散射（ICS）产生的。我们的发现表明，该模型在很大程度上阐明了观测到的SED。这些结果支持了γ射线源源自由PSR J1849-0001推动的PWN G32.64+0.53的假设。此外，TeV能带中的γ射线可能是通过星云内的电子/正电子通过ICS产生的。 <div>
In this study, we report the likely GeV γ-ray emissions originating from the pulsar PSR J1849-0001's pulsar wind nebula (PWN) G32.64+0.53. Our analysis covers approximately 14.7 yr of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope Pass 8. The position of the source and its spectrum matches those in X-ray and TeV energy bands, so we propose that the GeV γ-ray source is indicative of PWN G32.64+0.53. We interpret the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) using a time-dependent one-zone model, which assumes that the multiband nonthermal emission of the target source can be generated by synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering (ICS) of the electrons/positrons. Our findings demonstrate that the model substantially elucidates the observed SED. These results lend support to the hypothesis that the γ-ray source originates from the PWN G32.64+0.53 powered by PSR J1849-0001. Furthermore, the γ-rays in TeV bands are likely generated by electrons/positrons within the nebula through ICS.

总结: 
Fermi伽玛射线暴的光谱演化得以研究，发展了一种新算法来测试单脉冲形态，开展了公民科学测试以评估光度曲线形态和光谱演化。研究发现，单峰暴往往具有持续衰减的峰能量或硬到软的光谱演化，而多峰暴则有非单调下降的峰频率。这一发现与内部/外部冲击模型一致，并表明一些单脉冲暴与特别高密度的环境有关。<br /><br /> <div>
We analyze the spectral evolution of 62 bright Fermi gamma-ray bursts with large enough signal-to-noise to allow for time-resolved spectral analysis. We develop a new algorithm to test for single-pulse morphology that is insensitive to the specific shape of pulses. Instead, it only checks whether or not there are multiple, isolated, or statistical significant peaks in the light curve. In addition, we carry out a citizen science test to assess light-curve morphology and spectral evolution. We find that, no matter the adopted assessment method, bursts characterized by single-peaked prompt emission light curves have a greater tendency to also have a consistently decaying peak energy or hard-to-soft spectral evolution. This contrasts with the behavior of multipeaked bursts, for which the tendency is to have a peak frequency that is not monotonically decreasing. We discuss this finding in the theoretical framework of internal/external shocks and find it to be consistent with at least some single-pulse bursts associated with particularly high-density environments.

We present X-ray polarimetry observations from the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) of three low spectral peak and one intermediate spectral peak blazars, namely 3C 273, 3C 279, 3C 454.3, and S5 0716+714. For none of these objects was IXPE able to detect X-ray polarization at the 3σ level. However, we placed upper limits on the polarization degree at ∼10%–30%. The undetected polarizations favor models where the X-ray band is dominated by unpolarized photons upscattered by relativistic electrons in the jets of blazars, although hadronic models are not completely eliminated. We discuss the X-ray polarization upper limits in the context of our contemporaneous multiwavelength polarization campaigns.

总结:
该研究提出了一个用于银河系普通射电脉冲星的人口综合模型，考虑了最新的磁转演化过程。模型考虑了脉冲星的自旋减速、以磁力线为主的磁层和磁场强度及倾角的衰减。通过Markov Chain Monte Carlo技术将模拟的脉冲星人口与大型观测样本进行了拟合，比较了四个主要观测指标的分布。研究测试了两种B场衰减情形，并发现指数模型能更好地拟合观测到的脉冲星分布，暗示脉冲星B场在演化中出现了显著的衰减。 <div>
We present a population synthesis model for normal radio pulsars in the Galaxy incorporating the latest developments in the field and the magnetorotational evolution processes. Our model considers spin-down with a force-free magnetosphere and the decay of the magnetic field strength and its inclination angle. The simulated pulsar population is fit to a large observation sample that covers the majority of radio surveys using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique. We compare the distributions of four major observables—spin period (P), spin-down rate ( ), dispersion measure, and radio flux density—using accurate high-dimensional Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistics. We test two B-field decay scenarios, an exponential model motivated by ohmic dissipation and a power-law model motivated by the Hall effect. The former clearly provides a better fit, and it can successfully reproduce the observed pulsar distributions with a decay timescale of Myr. The result suggests that significant B-field decay in aged pulsars and ohmic dissipation could be the dominant process.

该研究使用TNG50宇宙学模拟中类似于银河系的星系的代表样本，探究了形成星盘的物理过程。研究发现，星盘的形成与恒星球冠的形成密切相关，这与最近的一个理论模型相吻合，该模型认为星盘的形成得到了重力势的促进。此外，研究还表明，星盘的形成与热环绕星系晕的形成有关。研究结果表明，这些过程可能同时发生，并对星盘的生长起着重要作用。总结：该研究发现星盘形成与恒星球冠形成，热环绕星系晕的形成等过程同时发生，并可能会对星盘的生长起着重要作用。 <div>
Using a representative sample of Milky Way (MW)–like galaxies from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, we investigate physical processes driving the formation of galactic disks. A disk forms as a result of the interplay between inflow and outflow carrying angular momentum in and out of the galaxy. Interestingly, the inflow and outflow have remarkably similar distributions of angular momentum, suggesting an exchange of angular momentum and/or outflow recycling, leading to continuous feeding of prealigned material from the corotating circumgalactic medium. We show that the disk formation in TNG50 is correlated with stellar bulge formation, in qualitative agreement with a recent theoretical model of disk formation facilitated by steep gravitational potentials. Disk formation is also correlated with the formation of a hot circumgalactic halo with around half of the inflow occurring at subsonic and transonic velocities corresponding to Mach numbers of ≲2. In the context of recent theoretical works connecting disk settling and hot halo formation, our results imply that the subsonic part of the inflow may settle into a disk while the remaining supersonic inflow will perturb this disk via the chaotic cold accretion. We find that disks tend to form when the host halos become more massive than ∼(1–2) × 1011M⊙, consistent with previous theoretical findings and observational estimates of the predisk protogalaxy remnant in the MW. Our results do not prove that either corotating outflow recycling, gravitational potential steepening, or hot halo formation cause disk formation, but they show that all these processes occur concurrently and may play an important role in disk growth.

总结:
NGC 330是一个年龄约40百万年的S型小麦哲伦云球状星团，通过对30颗恒星的高分辨率光谱分析，发现存在Be星，并且它们主要分布在分裂主序列的冷侧。这些目标星的自转速度测量结果表明，星团内存在两种类型的恒星：一类是自转速度快的Be星，另一类是温度较高、自转速度较慢的恒星。大多数目标的Hα发射线显示出Hδ光球吸收线的核心发射。样本中所计算的外壳参数显示，大多数观测恒星的倾角应低于75°。这些结果不仅确认了光度法探测到的Be星，还揭示了一些目标存在狭窄的Hα和Hδ特征，这些特征无法通过低分辨率光谱或光度法检测到。另外，观测还发现Hα线轮廓的不对称变化，这可能提供了关于分离盘几何形状的信息。观测还显示，一些暗弱目标存在星云Hα发射，强度足以影响光谱提取和用于评估Hα发射的窄带光度法。<br /><br /> <div>
We present an analysis of high-resolution optical spectra recorded for 30 stars of the split extended main-sequence turnoff of the young (∼40 Myr) Small Magellanic Cloud globular cluster NGC 330. Spectra were obtained with the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System and Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle spectrographs located on the Magellan-Clay 6.5 m telescope. These spectra revealed the presence of Be stars, occupying primarily the cool side of the split main sequence. Rotational velocity ( ) measurements for most of the targets are consistent with the presence of two populations of stars in the cluster: one made up of rapidly rotating Be stars ( km s−1) and the other consisting of warmer stars with slower rotation ( km s−1). Core emission in the Hδ photospheric lines was observed for most of the Hα emitters. The shell parameter computed for the targets in our sample indicates that most of the observed stars should have inclinations below 75°. These results confirm the detection of Be stars obtained through photometry but also reveal the presence of narrow Hα and Hδ features for some targets that cannot be detected with low-resolution spectroscopy or photometry. Asymmetry variability of Hα line profiles on the timescales of a few years is also observed and could provide information on the geometry of the decretion disks. Observations revealed the presence of nebular Hα emission, strong enough in faint targets to compromise the extraction of spectra and to impact narrow-band photometry used to assess the presence of Hα emission.

<div> M dwarf stars, K dwarf stars, habitable climates, observational advantages, planetary habitability
<br /><br />总结:
该篇文章研究了M和K矮星系中类地行星可能存在的气候和可居住性，发现K矮星行星具有更稳定的恒星环境，可能在“眼球”气候中发现湿润的日侧气候。同时，M和K矮星系中陆地行星都可能存在“边缘居住性”，但在M矮星系中更为普遍。这些发现有助于未来在M和K矮星系中寻找适合生命的行星。 <div>
M and K dwarf stars make up 86% of the stellar population and host many promising astronomical targets for detecting habitable climates in the near future. Of the two, M dwarfs currently offer greater observational advantages and are home to many of the most exciting observational discoveries in the last decade. But K dwarfs could offer even better prospects for detecting habitability by combining the advantages of a relatively dim stellar flux with a more stable stellar environment. Here we explore the climate regimes that are possible on Earth-like synchronous planets in M and K dwarf systems, and how they vary across the habitable zone. We focus on surface temperature patterns, water availability, and implications for habitability. We find that the risk of nightside cold trapping decreases with increased orbital radius and is overall lower for K dwarf planets. With reduced atmospheric shortwave absorption, K dwarf planets have higher dayside precipitation rates and less day-to-night moisture transport, resulting in lower nightside snow rates. These results imply a higher likelihood of detecting a planet with a moist dayside climate in a habitable “eyeball” climate regime orbiting a K dwarf star. We also show that “terminator habitability” can occur for both M and K dwarf land planets, but would likely be more prevalent in M dwarf systems. Planets in a terminator habitability regime tend to have slightly lower fractional habitability, but offer alternative advantages including instellation rates more comparable to Earth in regions that have temperatures amenable to life.

使用来自Gaia第三次数据释放的星星样本，研究了银河系的逃逸速度剖面，推断了银河系黑暗物质晕的性质，并得出了银河系的总质量。研究结果表明，银河系的总质量较低，但与其他最近的估计相吻合。 <div>
The escape velocity profile of the Milky Way offers a crucial and independent measurement of its underlying mass distribution and dark matter (DM) properties. Using a sample of stars from the third data release of Gaia with 6D kinematics and strict quality cuts, we obtain an escape velocity profile of the Milky Way from 4 to 11 kpc in Galactocentric radius. To infer the escape velocity in radial bins, we model the tail of the stellar speed distribution with both traditional power-law models and a new functional form that we introduce. While power-law models tend to rely on extrapolation to high speeds, we find our new functional form gives the most faithful representation of the observed distribution. Using this for the escape velocity profile, we constrain the properties of the Milky Way’s DM halo modeled as a Navarro–Frenck–White profile. Combined with constraints from the circular velocity at the solar position, we obtain a concentration and mass of and . This corresponds to a total Milky Way mass of , which is on the low end of the historic range of the galaxy’s mass, but in line with other recent estimates.

总结:
本研究探讨了中子俘获元素对星球化学相似性的影响，发现考虑中子俘获元素后，对于铁丰度在-0.1<[Fe/H]<0.1范围内的恒星，其化学相似率从约2.2％降低到0.4％，几乎减少了6倍。化学相似性与年龄和动力学相似性相关，但包括中子俘获元素似乎不会选择更相似于这些特征的恒星。这表明中子俘获元素包含与轻元素不同的信息，在银河丰度空间中至少增加了一个维度。这项工作强调了在对恒星进行化学表征时考虑中子俘获元素的重要性，并激励了改进光谱调查中的原子数据和测量的持续工作。 <div>
The observed chemical diversity of Milky Way stars places important constraints on Galactic chemical evolution and the mixing processes that operate within the interstellar medium. Recent works have found that the chemical diversity of disk stars is low. For example, the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) “chemical doppelganger rate,” or the rate at which random pairs of field stars appear as chemically similar as stars born together, is high, and the chemical distributions of APOGEE stars in some Galactic populations are well-described by two-dimensional models. However, limited attention has been paid to the heavy elements (Z > 30) in this context. In this work, we probe the potential for neutron-capture elements to enhance the chemical diversity of stars by determining their effect on the chemical doppelganger rate. We measure the doppelganger rate in GALactic Archaeology with HERMES DR3, with abundances rederived using The Cannon, and find that considering the neutron-capture elements decreases the doppelganger rate from ∼2.2% to 0.4%, nearly a factor of 6, for stars with −0.1 < [Fe/H] < 0.1. While chemical similarity correlates with similarity in age and dynamics, including neutron-capture elements does not appear to select stars that are more similar in these characteristics. Our results highlight that the neutron-capture elements contain information that is distinct from that of the lighter elements and thus add at least one dimension to Milky Way abundance space. This work illustrates the importance of considering the neutron-capture elements when chemically characterizing stars and motivates ongoing work to improve their atomic data and measurements in spectroscopic surveys.
