<title>Do Neutron Star Ultraluminous X-Ray Sources Masquerade as Intermediate-mass Black Holes in Radio and X-Ray?</title>

Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) were once largely believed to be powered by super-Eddington accretion onto stellar-mass black holes, although in some rare cases, ULXs also serve as potential candidates for (sub-Eddington) intermediate-mass black holes. However, a total of eight ULXs have now been confirmed to be powered by neutron stars, thanks to observed pulsations, and may act as contaminants for the radio/X-ray selection of intermediate-mass black holes. Here, we present the first comprehensive radio study of seven known neutron star ULXs using new and archival data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array and the Australia Telescope Compact Array, combined with the literature. Across this sample, there is only one confident radio detection, from the Galactic neutron star ULX Swift J0243.6+6124. The other six objects in our sample are extragalactic, and only one has coincident radio emission, which we conclude is most likely contamination from a background H ii region. We conclude that with current facilities, neutron star ULXs do not produce significant enough radio emission to cause them to be misidentified as radio-/X-ray-selected intermediate-mass black hole candidates. Thus, if background star formation has been properly considered, the current study indicates that a ULX with a compact radio counterpart is not likely to be a neutron star.

<title>Dust-obscured Galaxies in the XMM-SERVS Fields: Selection, Multiwavelength Characterization, and Physical Nature</title>

Dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) are enshrouded by dust and many are believed to host accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs), which makes them unique objects for probing the coevolution of galaxies and SMBHs. We select and characterize DOGs in the 13 deg2 XMM-Spitzer Extragalactic Representative Volume Survey (XMM-SERVS), leveraging the superb multiwavelength data—from X-rays to radio. We select 3738 DOGs at z ≈ 1.6–2.1 in XMM-SERVS, while maintaining good data quality without introducing significant bias. This represents the largest DOG sample with thorough multiwavelength source characterization. Spectral energy distribution modeling shows DOGs are a heterogeneous population consisting of both normal galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our DOGs are massive ( ), 174 are detected in X-rays, and they are generally radio-quiet systems. X-ray detected DOGs are luminous and are moderately to heavily obscured in X-rays. Stacking analyses for the X-ray undetected DOGs show highly significant average detections. Critically, we compare DOGs with matched galaxy populations. DOGs have similar AGN fractions compared with typical galaxy populations. X-ray detected DOGs have higher M⋆ and higher X-ray obscuration, but they are not more star-forming than typical X-ray AGNs. Our results potentially challenge the relevance of the merger-driven galaxy-SMBH coevolution framework for X-ray detected DOGs.

<title>Considerations for Photochemical Modeling of Possible Hycean Worlds</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8cda</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

JWST is revolutionising the study of temperate sub-Neptunes, starting with the first detection of carbon-bearing molecules in the habitable-zone sub-Neptune K2-18 b. The retrieved abundances of CH4 and CO2 and nondetection of NH3 and CO in K2-18 b are consistent with prior predictions of photochemical models for a Hycean world with a habitable ocean. However, recent photochemical modeling raised the prospect that the observed abundances may be explained by a mini-Neptune scenario instead. In this study, we explore these scenarios using independent photochemical modeling with K2-18 b as a case study. We find the previous results to be sensitive to a range of model assumptions, such as the photochemical cross sections, incident stellar spectrum, surface pressure, UV albedo, and metallicity, significantly affecting the resulting abundances. We explore a wide model space to investigate scenarios that are compatible with the retrieved molecular abundances for K2-18 b. Our analysis shows that the previously favored mini-Neptune scenario is not compatible with most of the retrieved abundances, while the Hycean scenarios, both inhabited and uninhabited, provide better agreement. An uninhabited Hycean scenario explains most of the abundance constraints, except CH4, which is generally underabundant but dependent on the model assumptions. The inhabited Hycean scenario is compatible with all the abundances if the observed CH4 is assumed to be predominantly biogenic. Our results underscore the importance of systematic photochemical modeling and accurate interpretation of chemical abundance constraints for candidate Hycean worlds.

<title>A High-resolution Far-infrared Survey to Probe Black Hole–Galaxy Co-evolution</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8e36</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8e36</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Far-infrared (FIR) surveys are critical to probing the co-evolution of black holes and galaxies, since of the order of half the light from accreting black holes and active star formation is emitted in the rest-frame IR over 0.5 ≲ z ≲ 10. For deep fields with areas of 1 deg2 or less, like the legacy surveys GOODS, COSMOS, and CANDELS, source crowding means that subarcsecond resolution is essential. In this paper, we show with a simulation of the FIR sky that observations made with a small telescope (2 m) at low angular resolution preferentially detect the brightest galaxies, and we demonstrate the scientific value of a space mission that would offer subarcsecond resolution. We envisage a facility that would provide high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy over the wavelength range 25–400 μm, and we present predictions for an extragalactic survey covering 0.5 deg2. Such a survey is expected to detect tens of thousands of star-forming galaxies and thousands of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), in multiple FIR lines (e.g., [C ii], [O i], and [C i]) and continuum. At the longest wavelengths (200–400 μm), it would probe beyond the Epoch of Reionization, up to z ∼ 7–8. A combination of spectral resolution, line sensitivity, and broad spectral coverage would allow us to learn about the physical conditions (temperature, density, and metallicity) characterizing the interstellar medium of galaxies over the past ∼12 billion years and to investigate galaxy–AGN co-evolution.

<title>Signature of Triaxially Precessing Magnetars in Gamma-Ray Burst X-Ray Afterglows</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9005</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9005</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The X-ray afterglows of some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) exhibit plateaus, which can be explained by the internal dissipation of a newborn millisecond magnetar wind. In the early phase of these newborn magnetars, the magnetic inclination angle undergoes periodic changes due to precession, leading to periodic modulation of the injection luminosity due to magnetic dipole radiation. This may result in quasiperiodic oscillations on the plateaus. In this paper, we identify four GRBs with regular flux variations on their X-ray afterglow plateaus from Swift/X-Ray Telescope data before 2023 November, three of which exhibit periodicity. Based on the likelihood of supporting a precessing magnetar as the central engine, we classify them into three categories: Gold (GRB 060202 and GRB 180620A), Silver (GRB 050730), and Bronze (GRB 210610A). We invoke a model of magnetic dipole radiation emitted by a triaxially freely precessing magnetar whose spindown is dominated by electromagnetic radiation, to fit the light curves. Our model successfully reproduces the light curves of these four GRBs, including the regular flux variations on the plateaus and their periodicity (if present). Our work provides further evidence for early precession in newborn millisecond magnetars in GRBs.

<title>The Pulsar Science Collaboratory: Multiepoch Scintillation Studies of Pulsars</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9008</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9008</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report on findings from scintillation analyses using high-cadence observations of eight canonical pulsars with observing baselines ranging from 1–3 yr. We obtain scintillation bandwidth and timescale measurements for all pulsars in our survey and scintillation arc curvature measurements for four, and we detect multiple arcs for two. We find evidence of a previously undocumented scattering screen along the line of sight (LOS) to PSR J1645−0317, as well as evidence that a scattering screen along the LOS to PSR J2313+4253 may reside somewhere within the Milky Way’s Orion–Cygnus arm. We report evidence of a significant change in the scintillation pattern in PSR J2022+5154 from the previous two decades of literature, wherein both the scintillation bandwidth and timescale decreased by an order of magnitude relative to earlier observations at the same frequencies, potentially as a result of a different screen dominating the observed scattering. By augmenting the results of previous studies, we find general agreement with estimations of scattering delays from pulsar observations and predictions by the NE2001 electron density model but not for the newest data we have collected, providing some evidence of changes in the ISM along various LOSs over the timespans considered. In a similar manner, we find additional evidence of a correlation between a pulsar’s dispersion measure and the overall variability of its scattering delays over time. The plethora of interesting science obtained through these observations demonstrates the capabilities of the Green Bank Observatory’s 20 m telescope to contribute to pulsar-based studies of the interstellar medium.

<title>Modeling the Multiwavelength Detection of Protoclusters. I. An Excess of Submillimeter Galaxies in Protocluster Cores</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90ae</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90ae</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Studies of galaxy protoclusters yield insights into galaxy cluster formation complementary to those obtained via “archaeological” studies of present-day galaxy clusters. Submillimeter-selected galaxies (SMGs) are one class of sources used to find high-redshift protoclusters. However, due to the rarity of protoclusters (and thus the large simulation volume required) and the complexity of modeling dust emission from galaxies, the relationship between SMGs and protoclusters has not been adequately addressed in the theoretical literature. In this work, we apply the L-GALAXIES semianalytic model (SAM) to the MillenniumN-body simulation. We assign submillimeter flux densities to the model galaxies using a scaling relation from previous work, in which dust radiative transfer was performed on high-resolution galaxy zoom simulations. We find that the fraction of model galaxies that are submillimeter-bright is higher in protocluster cores than in both protocluster “outskirts” and the field; the fractions for the latter two are similar. This excess is not driven by an enhanced starburst frequency. Instead, the primary reason is that overdense environments have a relative overdensity of high-mass halos and thus “oversample” the high-mass end of the star formation main sequence relative to less-dense environments. The fraction of SMGs that are optically bright is dependent on stellar mass and redshift but independent of the environment. The fraction of galaxies for which the majority of star formation is dust-obscured is higher in protocluster cores, primarily due to the dust-obscured fraction being correlated with stellar mass. Our results can be used to guide and interpret multiwavelength studies of galaxy populations in protoclusters.

<title>Massive Star Cluster Formation with Binaries. I. Evolution of Binary Populations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90b3</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90b3</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the evolution of populations of binary stars within massive cluster-forming regions. We simulate the formation of young massive star clusters within giant molecular clouds with masses ranging from 2 × 104 to 3.2 × 105 M⊙. We use Torch, which couples stellar dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, star and binary formation, stellar evolution, and stellar feedback through the Amuse framework. We find that the binary fraction decreases during cluster formation at all molecular cloud masses. The binaries’ orbital properties also change, with stronger and quicker changes in denser, more massive clouds. Most of the changes we see can be attributed to the disruption of binaries wider than 100 au, although the close binary fraction also decreases in the densest cluster-forming region. The binary fraction for O stars remains above 90%, but exchanges and dynamical hardening are ubiquitous, indicating that O stars undergo frequent few-body interactions early during the cluster formation process. Changes to the populations of binaries are a by-product of hierarchical cluster assembly: most changes to the binary population take place when the star formation rate is high, and there are frequent mergers between subclusters in the cluster-forming region. A universal primordial binary distribution based on observed inner companions in the Galactic field is consistent with the binary populations of young clusters with resolved stellar populations, and the scatter between clusters of similar masses could be explained by differences in their formation history.

<title>The Application of Manifold Learning to a Selection of Different Galaxy Populations and Scaling Relation Analysis</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90ba</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90ba</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The growing volume of data produced by large astronomical surveys necessitates the development of efficient analysis techniques capable of effectively managing high-dimensional data sets. This study addresses this need by demonstrating some applications of manifold learning and dimensionality reduction techniques, specifically the self-organizing map (SOM), on the optical+near-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) space of galaxies, with a focus on sample comparison, selection biases, and predictive power using a small subset. To this end, we utilize a large photometric sample from the five Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey fields and a subset with spectroscopic measurements from the KECK MOSDEF survey in two redshift bins at z ∼ 1.5 and z ∼ 2.2. We trained the SOM with the photometric data and mapped the spectroscopic data onto it as our study case. We found that MOSDEF targets do not cover all SED shapes existing in the SOM. Our findings reveal that active galactic nuclei within the MOSDEF sample are mapped onto the more massive regions of the SOM, confirming previous studies and known selection biases toward higher-mass, less dusty galaxies. Furthermore, SOMs were utilized to map measured spectroscopic features, examining the relationship between metallicity variations and galaxy mass. Our analysis confirmed that more massive galaxies exhibit lower [O iii]/Hβ and [O iii]/[O ii] ratios and higher Hα/Hβ ratios, consistent with the known mass–metallicity relation. These findings highlight the effectiveness of SOMs in analyzing and visualizing complex, multidimensional data sets, emphasizing their potential in data-driven astronomical studies.

<title>Making the Invisible Visible: Magnetic Fields in Accretion Flows Revealed by X-Ray Polarization</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9277</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9277</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Large-scale, strong magnetic fields are often evoked in black hole accretion flows, for jet launching in the low/hard state and to circumvent the thermal instability in the high/soft state. Here, we show how these ideas are strongly challenged by X-ray polarization measurements from the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). Quite general arguments show that equipartition large-scale fields in the accretion flow should be of order 106–8 G. These produce substantial Faraday rotation and/or depolarization. Since IXPE observes polarization in both spectral states, this sets upper limits to coherent large-scale (vertical, radial, or azimuthal) magnetic fields in the photosphere of B ≲ 5 × 106 G. While we stress that Faraday rotation should be calculated for each individual simulation (density, field geometry, and emissivity), it seems most likely that there are no equipartition-strength large-scale ordered fields inside the photosphere of the X-ray-emitting gas. Strong poloidal fields can still power a Blandford–Znajek jet in the low/hard state if they thread the black hole horizon rather than the X-ray-emitting flow, but this could also be challenged by (lack of) depolarization from vacuum birefringence. Instead, an alternative solution is that the low/hard state jet is dominated by pairs, so can be accelerated by lower fields. Strong toroidal fields could still stabilize the disk in the high/soft state if they are buried beneath the photosphere, though this seems unlikely due to magnetic buoyancy. Fundamentally, polarization data from IXPE mean that magnetic fields in black hole accretion flows are no longer invisible and unconstrained.

<title>Rethinking Thorne–Żytkow Object Formation: The Fate of X-Ray Binary LMC X-4 and Implications for Ultra-long Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad88f3</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad88f3</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a start-to-end simulation aimed at studying the long-term fate of high-mass X-ray binaries and whether a Thorne–Żytkow object (TŻO) might ultimately be assembled. We analyze results from a 3D hydrodynamical simulation that models the eventual fate of LMC X-4, a compact high-mass X-ray binary system, after the primary fills its Roche lobe and engulfs the neutron star companion. We discuss the outcome of this engulfment within the standard paradigm of TŻO formation. The post-merger angular momentum content of the stellar core is a key ingredient, as even a small amount of rotation can break spherical symmetry and produce a centrifugally supported accretion disk. Our findings suggest the inspiraling neutron star, upon merging with the core, can accrete efficiently via a disk at high rates (≈10−2M⊙ s−1), subsequently collapsing into a black hole and triggering a bright transient with a luminosity and duration typical of an ultra-long gamma-ray burst. We propose that the canonical framework for TŻO formation via common envelope needs to be revised, as the significant post-merger accretion feedback will unavoidably unbind the vast majority of the surrounding envelope.

<title>Radio Active Galactic Nuclei Activity in Low Redshift Galaxies Is Not Directly Related to Star Formation Rates</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8ac7</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8ac7</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We examine the demographics of radio-emitting active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the local Universe as a function of host galaxy properties, most notably both stellar mass (M⋆) and star formation rate (SFR). Radio AGN activity is theoretically implicated in helping reduce the SFR of galaxies, and therefore it is natural to investigate the relationship between these two galaxy properties. We use the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) optical IFU catalog in conjunction with the NVSS and Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty radio catalogs. MaNGA's high precision determinations of SFR allow us to impose a clean cut to reliably identify radio AGN from star formers. Using this sample of AGN, the well-measured stellar velocity dispersions from MaNGA, and the black hole M–σ relationship, we examine the Eddington ratio distribution (ERD) and its dependence on M⋆ and SFR. We find that the ERD depends strongly on M⋆, with more massive galaxies having larger Eddington ratios (λ). Interpreting our model fit to the data leads to a completeness-corrected estimate of FAGN(λ > 0.001), the fraction of galaxies with radio AGN with λ > 0.001. At , we estimate FAGN = 0.02. The AGN fraction increases rapidly with M⋆, and at , we estimate FAGN ∼ 0.24. We do not find any dependence on SFR, specific star formation rate, or velocity dispersion when controlling for stellar mass. We conclude that galaxy SFRs appear to be unrelated to the presence or absence of a radio AGN, which may be useful in constraining theoretical models of AGN feedback.

<title>An Empirical Framework Characterizing the Metallicity and Star-formation History Dependence of X-Ray Binary Population Formation and Emission in Galaxies</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8de7</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8de7</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a new empirical framework modeling the metallicity and star formation history (SFH) dependence of X-ray luminous (L ≳ 1036 erg s−1) point-source population X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) in normal galaxies. We expect that the X-ray point-source populations are dominated by X-ray binaries (XRBs), with contributions from supernova remnants near the low luminosity end of our observations. Our framework is calibrated using the collective statistical power of 3731 X-ray detected point sources within 88 Chandra-observed galaxies at D ≲ 40 Mpc that span broad ranges of metallicity (Z ≈ 0.03–2 Z⊙), SFH, and morphology (dwarf irregulars, late types, and early types). Our best-fitting models indicate that the XLF normalization per unit stellar mass declines by ≈2–3 dex from 10 Myr to 10 Gyr, with a slower age decline for low-metallicity populations. The shape of the XLF for luminous X-ray sources (L ≳ 1038 erg s−1) significantly steepens with increasing age and metallicity, while the lower-luminosity XLF appears to flatten with increasing age. Integration of our models provides predictions for X-ray scaling relations that agree very well with past results presented in the literature, including, e.g., the LX–SFR–Z relation for high-mass XRBs in young stellar populations as well as the LX/M⋆ ratio observed in early-type galaxies that harbor old populations of low-mass XRBs. The model framework and data sets presented in this paper further provide unique benchmarks that can be used for calibrating binary population synthesis models.

<title>A Dust Attenuation Model Inspired by the NIHAO-SKIRT-Catalog</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9334</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We use simulated attenuation curves from the NIHAO-SKIRT-Catalog to test the flexibility of commonly used dust attenuation models in the face of the variations expected from realistic star–dust geometries. Motivated by lack of flexibility in these existing models, we propose a novel dust attenuation model with three free parameters that can accurately recover the simulated attenuation curves as well as the best-fitting curves from the commonly used models. This new model is fully analytic and treats all starlight equally, in contrast to two-component dust attenuation models. We use the parameterization to investigate the relationship between the overall attenuation law shape and the strength of the 2175 Å bump. Our results indicate variation in star–dust geometry leads these features to correlate tightly, with grayer attenuation curves having weaker bumps.

<title>“SNe Ia Twins for Life”: Toward a Precise Determination of H 0</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad736d</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad736d</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Here we present an approach to the measurement of extragalactic distances using twin SNe Ia, taken from the early down to the nebular phase. The approach is purely empirical, although we can give a theoretical background on why the method is reliable. By studying those twins in galaxies where peculiar velocities are relatively unimportant, we can tackle the H0 tension problem. Here we apply the method to the determination of the distances to NGC 7250 and NGC 2525, who hosted, respectively, SN 2013dy and SN 2018gv, twins of two different SNe Ia prototypes: SN 2013aa/SN 2017cbv and SN 2011fe. From the study of the SN 2013aa and SN 2017cbv twin pair, by comparing it with SN 2011fe and applying the difference between the SN 2013aa/2017cbv and the SN 2011fe class, we also find a good estimate of the distance to NGC 5643. We have just started to measure distances with the method for the samples in W.L Freedman et al. and A. G. Riess et al. There are differences in measured distances to the same galaxy using Cepheids or TRGBs. In this context of discrepancy, the “twins for life” method is very competitive because it can provide distance estimates with a modulus error of σμ = 0.04 mag. Our findings called for a revision of the distances measured with Cepheids in A. G. Riess et al. (2022). NGC 7250 and NGC 2525 needed better measurements with Cepheids. We have noticed that the Cepheids-based distance obtained with the JWST in A. G. Riess et al. (2024a) for NGC 5643 is in good agreement with what we find, unlike their previous estimate in A. G. Riess et al. (2022). The Hubble tension can arise from the way in which the local SNe Ia sample is linked to the SNe Ia Hubble flow sample. A good calibration of SNe Ia in the local sample is needed and we have started to gather it. We also expect to apply the “twin” SNe Ia comparison from the local sample to that in galaxies with z >0.02–0.03 well into the Hubble flow to obtain a reliable value for H0. Those distant SNe Ia can be observed with the ELT or the JWST.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Differential Chromatic Refraction (DCR) is caused by the wavelength dependence of our atmosphere’s refractive index, which shifts the apparent positions of stars and galaxies and distorts their shapes depending on their spectral energy distributions. While this effect is typically mitigated and corrected for in imaging observations, we investigate how DCR can instead be used to our advantage to infer the redshifts of supernovae from multiband, time-series imaging data. We simulate Type Ia supernovae in the proposed Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time Deep Drilling Field, and evaluate astrometric redshifts. We find that the redshift accuracy improves dramatically with the statistical quality of the astrometric measurements as well as with the accuracy of the astrometric solution. For a conservative choice of a 5 mas systematic uncertainty floor, we find that our redshift estimation is accurate at z < 0.6. We then combine our astrometric redshifts with both host-galaxy photometric redshifts and supernovae photometric (light-curve) redshifts and show that this considerably improves the overall redshift estimates. These astrometric redshifts will be valuable, especially since Rubin will discover a vast number of supernovae for which we will not be able to obtain spectroscopic redshifts.

<title>The SUPERCOLD-CGM Survey. II. [C i](1–0) Emission and the Physical Conditions of Cold Gas in Enormous Lyα Nebulae at z ∼ 2</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and Atacama Compact Array observations of atomic carbon ([C i](1–0)) and dust continuum in 10 enormous Lyα nebulae hosting ultraluminous Type-I QSOs at z = 2.2–2.5, as part of the Survey of Protocluster ELANe Revealing CO/C i in the Lyα Detected CGM. We detect [C i](1–0) and dust in all 10 QSOs and five companion galaxies. We find that the QSOs and companions have higher gas densities and more intense radiation fields than Luminous Infrared galaxies and high-z main sequence galaxies, with the highest values found in the QSOs. By comparing molecular gas masses derived from [C i](1–0), CO(4−3), and dust continuum, we find that the QSOs and companions display a similar low CO conversion factor of αCO ∼ 0.8 M☉ . After tapering our data to low resolution, the [C i](1–0) flux increases for nine QSOs, hinting at the possibility of [C i](1–0) in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) on a scale of 16−40 kpc. However, the [C i](1–0) sensitivity is too low to confirm this for individual targets, except for a tentative (2.7σ) CGM detection in Q0050+0051 with = (1.0–2.8) × 1010M☉. The 3σ mass limits of molecular CGM for the remaining QSO fields are (0.2–1.4) × 1010M☉. This translates into a baryon fraction of <0.4%–3% in the molecular CGM relative to the total baryonic halo mass. Our sample also includes a radio-detected active galactic nuclei, Q1416+2649, which shows [C i](1–0) and CO(4−3) luminosities an order of magnitude fainter for its far-infrared luminosity than other QSOs in our sample, possibly due to a lower molecular gas mass.

<title>GRB 211024B: An Ultra-long GRB Powered by Magnetar</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Ultra-long gamma-ray bursts are characterized by exceptionally long-duration central engine activities, with characteristic timescales exceeding 1000 s. We present ground-based optical afterglow observations of the ultra-long gamma-ray burst GRB 211024B, detected by Swift. Its X-ray light curve exhibits a characteristic “internal plateau” with a shallow decay phase lasting approximately ∼15 ks, followed by a steep decline (αdrop ∼ −7.5). Moreover, the early optical emission predicted by the late r-band optical afterglow is significantly higher than the observed value, indicating an external shock with energy injection. To explain these observations, we propose a magnetar central engine model. The magnetar collapses into a black hole due to spin-down or hyperaccretion, leading to the observed steep break in the X-ray light curve. The afterglow model fitting reveals that the afterglow injection luminosity varies with different assumptions of the circumburst medium density, implying different potential energy sources. For the interstellar medium case with a fixed injection end time, the energy may originate from the magnetar’s dipole radiation. However, in other scenarios, relativistic jets produced by the magnetar/black hole system could be the primary energy source.

<title>The Radio Spectra of High-luminosity Compact Symmetric Objects: Implications for Studies of Compact Jetted Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad89bb</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad89bb</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This paper addresses, for the first time, a key aspect of the phenomenology of compact symmetric objects (CSOs): the characteristics of their radio spectra. We present a radio-spectrum description of a complete sample of high-luminosity CSOs (CSO-2s), which shows that they exhibit the complete range of spectral types, including flat-spectrum sources (α ≥ −0.5), steep-spectrum sources (α < −0.5), and peaked-spectrum sources. We show that there is no clear correlation between spectral type and size, but there is a correlation between the high-frequency spectral index and both object type and size. We also show that, to avoid biasing the data and to understand the various classes of active galactic nuclei (AGN) involved, the complete range of spectral types should be included in studying the general phenomenology of compact jetted AGN, and that complete samples must be used, selected over a wide range of frequencies. We discuss examples that demonstrate these points. We find that the high-frequency spectral indices of CSO-2s span −1.3 < αhi < −0.3 and hence that radio spectral signatures cannot be used to discriminate definitively between CSO-2s, binary galactic nuclei, and millilensed objects, unless they have αhi > −0.3.

<title>Realistic Outcomes of Moon–Moon Collisions in Lunar Formation Theory</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The multiple impact hypothesis proposes that the Moon formed through a series of smaller collisions, rather than a single giant impact. This study advances our understanding of this hypothesis, as well as moon collisions in other contexts, by exploring the implications of these smaller impacts, employing a novel methodological approach that combines self-consistent initial conditions, hybrid hydrodynamic/N-body simulations, and the incorporation of material strength. Our findings challenge the conventional assumption of perfect mergers in previous models, revealing a spectrum of collision outcomes including partial accretion and mass loss. These outcomes are sensitive to collision parameters and the Earth’s tidal influence, underscoring the complex dynamics of lunar accretion. Importantly, we demonstrate that incorporating material strength is important for accurately simulating moonlet-sized impacts. This inclusion significantly affects fragmentation, tidal disruption, and the amount of material ejected or accreted onto the Earth, ultimately impacting the Moon’s growth trajectory. By accurately modeling diverse collision outcomes, our hybrid approach provides a powerful new framework for understanding the Moon’s formation. We show that most collisions (≈90%) do not significantly erode the largest moonlet, supporting the feasibility of lunar growth through accretion. Moreover, we revise previous estimates of satellite disruption, suggesting a higher survival rate and further bolstering the multiple-impact scenario.

<title>Investigating Differences in the Palomar-Green Blazar Population Using Polarization</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8d58</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present polarization images with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in A- and B-array configurations at 6 GHz of seven radio-loud (RL) quasars and eight BL Lac objects belonging to the Palomar-Green (PG) “blazar” sample. This completes our arcsecond-scale polarization study of an optically selected volume-limited blazar sample comprising 16 radio-loud quasars and 8 BL Lac objects. Using the VLA, we identify kiloparsec-scale polarization in the cores and jets/lobes of all the blazars, with fractional polarization varying from around 0.8% ± 0.3% to 37% ± 6%. The kiloparsec-scale jets in PG RL quasars are typically aligned along their parsec-scale jets and show apparent magnetic fields parallel to jet directions in their jets/cores and magnetic field compression in their hot spots. The quasars show evidence of interaction with their environment as well as restarted active galactic nucleus activity through morphology, polarization, and spectral indices. These quasi-periodic jet modulations and restarted activity may be indicative of an unstable accretion disk undergoing transition. We find that the polarization characteristics of the BL Lacs are consistent with their jets being reoriented multiple times, with no correlation between their core apparent magnetic field orientations and parsec-scale jet directions. We find that the low synchrotron peaked BL Lacs show polarization and radio morphology features typical of “strong” jet sources as defined by E. T. Meyer et al. for the “blazar envelope scenario,” which posits a division based on jet profiles and velocity gradients rather than total jet power.

<title>Constraining the Excitation of Molecular Gas in Two Quasar-starburst Systems at z ∼ 6</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array observations of CO(8–7), (9–8), and (10–9) lines, as well as the underlying continuum for two far-infrared luminous quasars: SDSS J2054-0005 at z = 6.0389 and SDSS J0129-0035 at z = 5.7788. Both quasars were previously detected in CO (2–1) and (6–5) transitions, making them candidates for studying the CO spectral line energy distribution (SLED) of quasars at z ∼ 6. Utilizing the radiative transfer code CLOUDY, we fit the CO SLED with two heating mechanisms, including the photodissociation region (PDR) and X-ray-dominated region (XDR) for both objects. The CO SLEDs can be fitted by either a dense PDR component with an extremely strong far-ultraviolet radiation field (gas density nH ∼ 106 cm−3 and field strength G0 ≳ 106) or a two-component model including a PDR and an XDR. However, the line ratios, including LTIR and previous [C ii]158 μm and [C i]369 μm measurements, argue against a very high PDR radiation field strength. Thus, the results prefer a PDR+XDR origin for the CO SLED. The excitation of the high-J CO lines in both objects is likely dominated by the central active galactic nucleus (AGN). We then check the CO (9–8)-to-(6–5) line luminosity ratio r96 for all z ∼ 6 quasars with available CO SLEDs (seven in total) and find that there are no clear correlations between r96 and both LFIR and the AGN UV luminosities. This further demonstrates the complexity of the CO excitation powered by both the AGN and nuclear star formation in these young quasar host galaxies.

<title>Photochemical Hazes in Exoplanetary Skies with Diamonds: Microphysical Modeling of Haze Composition Evolution via Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8e67</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8e67</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Observational efforts in the last decade suggest the prevalence of photochemical hazes in exoplanetary atmospheres. Recent JWST observations raise growing evidence that exoplanetary hazes tend to have reflective compositions, unlike the conventionally assumed haze analogs, such as tholin and soot. In this study, I propose a novel hypothesis: diamond formation through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) may be happening in exoplanetary atmospheres. Using an aerosol microphysical model combined with the theory of CVD diamond and soot formation established in the industry community, I study how the haze composition evolves in exoplanetary atmospheres for various planetary equilibrium temperatures, atmospheric metallicity, and C/O ratio. I find that CVD diamond growth dominates over soot growth in a wide range of planetary parameters. Diamond haze formation is most efficient at Teq ∼ 1000 K and low atmospheric metallicity ([M/H] ≤ 2.0), while soot could be the main haze component only if the atmosphere is hot (Teq ≳ 1200 K) and carbon rich (C/O > 1). I also compute transmission, emission, and reflected light spectra, thereby suggesting possible observational signatures of diamond hazes, including the 3.53 μm feature of hydrogenated diamonds, anomalously faint thermal emission due to thermal scattering, and a drastic increase in geometric albedo. This study suggests that warm exoplanetary atmospheres may be favorable sites for forming CVD diamonds, which would be testable by future observations by JWST and Ariel as well as haze synthesis experiments under hot hydrogen-rich conditions.

<title>Theoretical Diagnostics for Narrow-line Regions of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Gas metallicity, ionization parameter, and gas pressure can affect the observed ratios of specific strong emission lines within galaxies. While the theoretical strong lines diagnostics for gas metallicity, ionization parameters, and gas pressure in star-forming regions are well-established, theoretical diagnostics for active galactic nuclei (AGNs) narrow-line regions are still lacking. In P. Zhu et al., we presented a new AGN model that provides the best predictions for observations spanning the UV, optical, and infrared wavelengths. This paper presents a suite of theoretical diagnostics for the gas metallicity, ionization parameter, gas pressure, and the peak energy in AGN ionizing radiation field Epeak for AGN narrow-line regions spanning the UV and optical wavelengths. We investigate the model dependency on the ionization parameter, gas pressure, Epeak, and the nitrogen scaling relation and make recommendations on metallicity diagnostics that are most robust against these parameters. We test our new AGN metallicity diagnostics using optical galaxy spectra from Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR16. These tests show that the metallicities measured from different diagnostics in this paper are consistent within ∼0.3 dex. We compare consistent H ii and AGN diagnostics and demonstrate that H ii and AGN diagnostics should not be used interchangeably. With a wide wavelength coverage, we anticipate that these AGN diagnostics will enable new metallicity studies of galaxies dominated by AGN.

<title>The Alignment of High-resolution Solar Prominence Images Observed by the New Vacuum Solar Telescope</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
High spatial resolution observation of solar prominence is an important observation subject of the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST). While the current level of observation and image reconstruction technologies for solar prominences are advanced, a significant challenge remains in achieving high-precision alignment among high-resolution prominence images observed at different times and different off-bands. Existing alignment approaches either become ineffective or yield low accuracy, and always require manual intervention during the alignment. These limitations are largely due to the stronger edge gradient and lower structural contrast of the prominence images compared with the solar surface ones. In response to this challenge, our study aims to develop an effective and robust algorithm for high-precision alignment of the prominence images. We thoroughly consider the unique structural characteristics of prominence images and the specific application conditions of various alignment algorithms. Consequently, we propose a comprehensive alignment method that incorporates the optical flow field of the solar surface, the gradient of the solar edge, and the cross-correlation within the solar prominence region. This method is designed to accurately determine the movement displacements among the prominence images. Our results demonstrate that this alignment method excels in both accuracy and robustness, making it well-suited for handling the diverse postures of solar prominence images captured by the NVST.

<title>Visual Orbits of Wolf–Rayet Stars. II. The Orbit of the Nitrogen-rich Wolf–Rayet Binary WR 138 Measured with the CHARA Array</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Classical Wolf–Rayet (WR) stars are descendants of massive OB-type stars that have lost their hydrogen-rich envelopes and are in the final stages of stellar evolution, possibly exploding as Type Ib/c supernovae. It is understood that the mechanisms driving this mass loss are either strong stellar winds and or binary interactions, so intense studies of these binaries including their evolution can tell us about the importance of the two pathways in WR formation. WR 138 (HD 193077) has a period of just over 4 yr and was previously reported to be resolved through interferometry. We report on new interferometric data combined with spectroscopic radial velocities in order to provide a three-dimensional orbit of the system. The precision on our parameters tend to be about an order of magnitude better than previous spectroscopic techniques. These measurements provide masses of the stars, namely, MWR = 13.93 ± 1.49 M⊙ and MO = 26.28 ± 1.71 M⊙. The derived orbital parallax agrees with the parallax from Gaia, namely, with a distance of 2.13 kpc. We compare the system’s orbit to models from BPASS, showing that the system likely may have been formed with little interaction but could have formed through some binary interactions either following or at the start of a red supergiant phase but with the most likely scenario occurring as the red supergiant phase starts for a ∼40 M⊙ star.

<title>High-precision Galaxy Clustering Predictions from Small-volume Hydrodynamical Simulations via Control Variates</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Cosmological simulations of galaxy formation are an invaluable tool for understanding galaxy formation and its impact on cosmological parameter inference from large-scale structures. However, their high computational cost is a significant obstacle for running simulations that probe cosmological volumes comparable to those analyzed by contemporary large-scale structure experiments. In this work, we explore the possibility of obtaining high-precision galaxy clustering predictions from small-volume hydrodynamical simulations such as MillenniumTNG and FLAMINGO via control variates. In this approach, the hydrodynamical full-physics simulation is paired with a matched low-resolution gravity-only simulation. By learning the galaxy–halo connection from the hydrodynamical simulation and applying it to the gravity-only counterpart, one obtains a galaxy population that closely mimics the one in the more expensive simulation. One can then construct an estimator of galaxy clustering that combines the clustering amplitudes in the small-volume hydrodynamical and gravity-only simulations with clustering amplitudes in a large-volume gravity-only simulation. Depending on the galaxy sample, clustering statistic, and scale, this galaxy clustering estimator can have an effective volume of up to around 100 times the volume of the original hydrodynamical simulation in the nonlinear regime. With this approach, we can construct galaxy clustering predictions from existing simulations that are precise enough for mock analyses of next-generation large-scale structure surveys such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time.

<title>Emergence of the Galaxy Morphology–Star Formation Activity–Clustercentric Radius Relations in Galaxy Clusters</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9276</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate when and how the relations of galaxy morphology and star-forming activity with clustercentric radius become evident in galaxy clusters. We identify 162 galaxy clusters with total mass at z = 0.625 in the Horizon Run 5 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation and study how the properties of the galaxies with stellar mass M* > 5 × 109M⊙ near the cluster main progenitors have evolved in the past. Galaxies are classified into disk, spheroid, and irregular morphological types according to the asymmetry and Sérsic index of their stellar mass distribution. We also classify galaxies into active and passive ones depending on their specific star formation rate. We find that the morphology–clustercentric radius relation (MRR) emerges at z ≃ 1.8 as the fraction of spheroidal types exceeds 50% in the central region (d ≲ 0.1R200). Galaxies outside the central region remain disk-dominated. Numerous encounters between galaxies in the central region seem to be responsible for the morphology transformation from disks to spheroids. We also find that the star formation activity–clustercentric radius relation emerges at an epoch different from that of MRR. At z ≃ 0.8, passive galaxies start to dominate the intermediate radius region (0.1 ≲ d/R200 ≲ 0.3), and this “quenching region” grows inward and outward thereafter. The region dominated by early-type galaxies (spheroids and passive disks) first appears at the central region at z ≃ 1.8, expands rapidly to larger radii as the population of passive disks grows in the intermediate radii, and clusters are dominated by early types after z ≃ 0.8.

<title>Shear Particle Acceleration in Structured Gamma-Ray Burst Jets. I. Physical Origin of the Band Function and Application to GRBs 090926A, 131108A, and 160509A</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The radiation physics of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains an open question. Based on the simulation analysis and recent observations, it was proposed that GRB jets are composed of a narrow ultrarelativistic core surrounded by a wide subrelativistic cocoon. We show that emission from the synchrotron radiations and the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) process of shear-accelerated electrons in the mixed jet-cocoon (MJC) region and internal-shock-accelerated electrons in the jet core is potentially explained the spectral characteristics of the prompt gamma rays. Assuming an exponential-decay velocity profile, the shear flow in the MJC region can accelerate electrons up to for injected electrons with γe,inject = 3 × 102 if its magnetic field strength ( ) is 100 G and its inner-edge velocity ( ) is 0.9 c. The cooling of these electrons is dominated by the SSC process, and the emission flux peaks at the keV band. In addition, the energy flux of synchrotron radiations of internal-shock-accelerated electrons (γe = 104 ∼ 105) peaks at around the keV−MeV band, assuming a bulk Lorentz factor of 300, a magnetic field strength of ∼106 G for the jet core. Adding the flux from both the jet core and the MJC region, the total spectral energy distribution illustrates similar characteristics as the broadband observations of GRBs. The bimodal and Band cut spectra observed in GRBs 090926A, 131108A, and 160509A can be well fit with our model. The derived varies from 54 G to 450 G and c.

<title>Synchrotron Break Frequencies of Mildly to Highly Relativistic Outflows Observed Off-axis</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9684</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We consider the synchrotron spectrum produced by mildly to highly relativistic collisionless shocks. Simple analytic formulae are derived for the break frequencies (peak frequency, self-absorption frequency, synchrotron, and inverse Compton cooling frequencies) of the emission produced by postshock plasma elements propagating at an angle θe relative to the observer’s line of sight. These formulae reproduce well the results of earlier exact analytic calculations valid for ultrarelativistic shocks and also hold for γ < 10 and for “off-axis” propagation (deviating from the ultrarelativistic results by approximately 1 order of magnitude). Our results will improve parameter estimation accuracy from future observations of synchrotron emission produced by collisionless shocks driven by the relativistic ejected material from compact object mergers and jetted tidal disruption events. The improved accuracy for mildly relativistic velocities is essential since most events will be observed off-axis, with γ < 10 outflows dominating the synchrotron emission (due to relativistic beaming). For GW170817, our results imply that (i) the Lorentz factor of the plasma emitting the observed radiation is bounded by 2.6 < γ at t ∼ 10 days and by γ < 12 at t > 16 days, (ii) the interstellar medium (ISM) density, n, and the fraction of internal energy density held by magnetic fields, εB, are bounded by n · εB ≲ 3 × 10−7 cm−3. In future merger events in higher-density ISM, the peak and cooling frequencies may be identified in the radio and X-ray bands; consequently, γ, n · εB could be measured as opposed to the case of GW170817, where these frequencies are out of the observable range.

<title>The Peak Frequency and Luminosity of Synchrotron Emitting Shocks: From Nonrelativistic to Ultrarelativistic Explosions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Synchrotron emission is ubiquitous in explosive astrophysical events—it is a natural byproduct of shocks formed when matter expelled by the explosion collides with ambient material. This emission is well observed in various classes of transients, and is often interpreted within a canonical “equipartition” framework that allows physical properties of the shock to be inferred from the frequency and luminosity at which the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) peaks. This framework has been remarkably successful in explaining observations of radio supernovae. It has also been used for transrelativistic explosions, where the shock velocities approach the speed of light. However, the conventional framework does not incorporate relativistic effects. Neither does it account for thermal electrons, which have been shown to be important for high-velocity shocks. In this paper we describe a revised framework that accounts for these two effects, and is applicable to nonrelativistic, transrelativistic, and ultrarelativistic explosions. We show that accounting for these effects can dramatically change the inferred parameters of high-velocity shocks, and, in particular, that the shock velocity, ambient density, and total energy are overestimated by the conventional nonrelativistic framework. We delineate the phase-space where such modifications are important in terms of observationally measurable parameters. We also find a novel upper limit on the peak synchrotron luminosity of shock-powered transients, which is remarkably consistent with existing observations. Finally, we discuss a prediction of the model—that the SED will qualitatively change as a function of shock velocity—and show that this is broadly consistent with data for representative events (e.g., SN1998bw, AT2018cow, CSS161010, AT2020xnd).

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We develop a robust machine learning classifier model utilizing the eXtreme-Gradient Boosting (XGB) algorithm for improved classification of Galactic Wolf–Rayet (WR) stars based on IR colors and positional attributes. For our study, we choose an extensive data set of 6555 stellar objects (from 2MASS and AllWISE data releases) lying in the Milky Way (MW) with available photometric magnitudes of different types, including WR stars. Our XGB classifier model can accurately (with an 86% detection rate) identify a sufficient number of WR stars against a large sample of non-WR sources. The XGB model outperforms other ensemble classifier models, such as Random Forest. Also, using the XGB algorithm, we develop a WR subtype classifier model that can differentiate the WR subtypes from the non-WR sources with a high model accuracy (>60%). Further, we apply both XGB-based models to a selection of 6457 stellar objects with unknown object types, detecting 58 new WR star candidates and predicting subtypes for 10 of them. The identified WR sources are mainly located in the local spiral arm of the MW and mostly lie in the solar neighborhood.

<title>Revisiting Radio Variability of the Blazar 3C 454.3</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We examine lengthy radio light curves of the flat spectrum radio galaxy 3C 454.3 for possible quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs). The data used in this work were collected at five radio frequencies, 4.8, 8.0, 14.5, 22.0, and 37.0 GHz between 1979 and 2013 as observed at the University of Michigan Radio Astronomical Observatory, Crimean Astrophysical Observatory, and Aalto University Metsähovi Radio Observatory. We employ generalized Lomb–Scargle periodogram and weighted wavelet transform analyses to search for periodicities in these light curves. We confirm a QPO period of ∼2000 days to be at least 4σ significant using both methods at all five radio frequencies between 1979 and 2007, after which a strong flare changed the character of the light curve. We also find a ∼600 day period, which is at least 4σ significant, but only in the 22.0 and 37.0 GHz light curves. We briefly discuss physical mechanisms capable of producing such variations.

<title>CSS 161010: A Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transient with Broad Blueshifted Hydrogen Lines</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad89a5</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared photometric and optical spectroscopic observations of the luminous fast blue optical transient (LFBOT) CSS 161010:045834–081803 (CSS 161010). The transient was found in a low-redshift (z = 0.033) dwarf galaxy. The light curves of CSS 161010 are characterized by an extremely fast evolution and blue colors. The V-band light curve shows that CSS 161010 reaches an absolute peak of mag in 3.8 days from the start of the outburst. After maximum, CSS 161010 follows a power-law decline ∝t−2.8±0.1 in all optical bands. These photometric properties are comparable to those of well-observed LFBOTs such as AT 2018cow, AT 2020mrf, and AT 2020xnd. However, unlike these objects, the spectra of CSS 161010 show a remarkable transformation from a blue and featureless continuum to spectra dominated by very broad, entirely blueshifted hydrogen emission lines with velocities of up to 10% of the speed of light. The persistent blueshifted emission and the lack of any emission at the rest wavelength of CSS 161010 are unique features not seen in any transient before CSS 161010. The combined observational properties of CSS 161010 and its M* ∼ 108M⊙ dwarf galaxy host favor the tidal disruption of a star by an intermediate-mass black hole as its origin.

<title>Varying Activity and the Burst Properties of FRB 20240114A Probed with GMRT Down to 300 MHz</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad84de</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) can exhibit a wide range of burst repetition rates, from none to hundreds of bursts per hour. Here we report the detection and characteristics of 60 bursts from the recently discovered FRB 20240114A, observed with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope in the frequency ranges 300–500 MHz and 550–750 MHz. The majority of the bursts show narrow emission bandwidth with Δν/ν ∼ 10%. All of the bursts we detect are faint (<10 Jy ms) and thus probe the lower end of the energy distribution. We determine the rate function for FRB 20240114A at 400 MHz and downward drift rates at 400 and 650 MHz, and we discuss our measurements in the context of the repeating FRB population. We observe sudden variations in the burst activity of FRB 20240114A over time. From our data and the publicly available information on other observations of FRB 20240114A so far, there is an indication that FRB 20240114A potentially exhibits chromaticity in its burst activity. While the burst properties of FRB 20240114A are similar to other repeating FRBs, the frequency-dependent activity, if established, could provide crucial clues to the origin of repeating FRBs. We also place the most stringent 5σ upper limits of 600 and 89 μJy on any persistent radio source (PRS) associated with FRB 20240114A at 400 and 650 MHz, respectively, and compare these with the luminosity of the known PRSs associated with FRB 121102A and FRB 190520B.

<title>Semisupervised Learning for Detecting Inverse Compton Emission in Galaxy Clusters</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8888</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8888</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Inverse Compton (IC) emission associated with the nonthermal component of the intracluster medium (ICM) has been a long-sought phenomenon in cluster physics. Traditional spectral fitting often suffers from the degeneracy between the two-temperature thermal (2T) spectrum and the one-temperature plus IC power-law (1T+IC) spectrum. We present a semisupervised deep-learning approach to search for IC emission in galaxy clusters. We employ a conditional autoencoder (CAE), which is based on an autoencoder with latent representations trained to constrain the thermal parameters of the ICM. The algorithm is trained and tested using synthetic NuSTAR X-ray spectra with instrumental and astrophysical backgrounds included. The training data set only contains 2T spectra, which is more common than 1T+IC spectra. Anomaly detection is performed on the validation and test data sets consisting of 2T spectra as the normal set and 1T+IC spectra as anomalies. With a threshold anomaly score, chosen based on cross validation, our algorithm is able to identify spectra that contain an IC component in the test data set, with a balanced accuracy (BAcc) of 0.64, which outperforms traditional spectral fitting (BAcc = 0.55) and ordinary autoencoders (BAcc = 0.55). Traditional spectral fitting is better at identifying IC cases among true IC spectra (a better recall), while IC predictions made by CAE have a higher chance of being true IC cases (a better precision), demonstrating that they mutually complement each other.

<title>Radial Profiles of Σ*, ΣSFR, Gas Metallicity, and Their Correlations across the Galactic Mass–Size Plane</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8a61</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8a61</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We analyzed the global and resolved properties of approximately 1240 nearby star-forming galaxies from the MaNGA survey, comparing compact and extended galaxies—those with smaller and larger radii (Re), respectively—at a fixed stellar mass (M*). Compact galaxies typically exhibit lower H i gas fractions, higher dust extinction, higher metallicity, greater mass concentration, and lower angular momentum on a global scale. Radial profiles of stellar mass surface density (Σ*) and star formation rate surface density (ΣSFR) as functions of the effective radius (R/Re) reveal that compact galaxies display steeper gradients and higher values, resulting in elevated specific star formation rates (sSFRs) in their inner regions compared to their outskirts. At a given Σ*, compact galaxies have higher sSFRs than extended galaxies, particularly in low-mass galaxies (log(M*/M⊙) ≤ 1010). Additionally, their metallicity profiles differ significantly: extended galaxies have steeper metallicity gradients, while compact galaxies exhibit flatter slopes and higher metallicity at a given R/Re. After accounting for the dependence of metallicity on M* and Σ*, no further correlation with SFR is observed. The combination of higher sSFR and potentially higher star formation efficiency in compact galaxies suggests that their central gas is being rapidly consumed, leading to older stellar populations, as indicated by Dn(4000) and EW(HδA), and resulting in faster central growth. Our results reveal that radial SFR profiles cannot be fully determined by M* and Σ* alone; other factors, such as galaxy size or angular momentum, must be considered to fully understand the observed trends.

<title>Exploring the Diversity of Faint Satellites in the M81 Group</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8c3a</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8c3a</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In the last decade, we have been able to probe further down the galaxy luminosity function than ever before and expand into the regime of ultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs), which are some of the best probes we have of small-scale cosmology and galaxy formation. Digital sky surveys have enabled the discovery and study of these incredibly low-mass, highly dark-matter-dominated systems around the Local Group, but it is critical that we expand the satellite census further out to understand if Milky Way and M31 satellites are representative of dwarf populations in the local Universe. Using data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), we present updated characterization of four satellite systems in the M81 group. These systems—D1005+68, D1006+69, DWJ0954+6821, and D1009+68—were previously discovered using ground-based Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam data as overdensities in M81's halo, and are now confirmed with HST/ACS by this work. These are all faint (MV ≥ −7.9) and consistent with old (∼13 Gyr), metal-poor ([M/H] < −1.5) populations. Each system possesses relatively unusual features—including one of the most concentrated satellite galaxies with a Sérsic index of n ∼ 5, one of the most elliptical galaxies outside the Local Group with an ϵ ∼ 0.6, and one of the most compact galaxies for its magnitude. Two of the satellites have very low surface brightness, lower than most known galaxies in this absolute magnitude range. This work previews the scientific promise of the upcoming Rubin Observatory and Roman Telescope for illuminating the diversity of UFDs in the Local Volume and beyond.

<title>Unveiling the Emission Mechanisms of Blazar PKS 1510-089. I. Multiwavelength Variability</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8ddd</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The flat spectrum radio quasar PKS 1510-089 is one of the most active blazars in γ-rays, exhibiting phases of very high activity. This study investigates its variability over a decade across a wide range of wavelengths, from radio to γ-rays. Utilizing the nonthermal dominance parameter, we analyze the Hβ, Hγ, and λ5100 Å continuum light curves to discern the primary source of continuum emission, either from the accretion disk or the jet, during different activity phases. Our findings underscore the dominance of jet emission in the continuum during flare-like events. We observed an approximately 80 day delay between the Hβ and continuum emissions, which we attribute to the spatial separation between the optical emission zone and the broad-line region. Near-zero delays between optical and near-infrared emissions suggest that the emitting regions within the jet are cospatial. Synchrotron self-Compton was identified as the primary mechanism for γ-ray emission during flares, supported by the minimal delay observed between optical/near-infrared emissions and γ-rays. Additionally, we found a delay of about 60 days between the leading optical/near-infrared emissions and X-rays, indicating that inverse Compton scattering within the jet predominantly drives X-ray emission. However, distinguishing between synchrotron self-Compton and external inverse Compton mechanism was not feasible. Shifts in the spectral index across the 15–230 GHz range corresponded with ejections from the radio core, suggesting changes in the physical conditions of the jet.

<title>An Evaluation of Different Numerical Methods to Calculate the Pitch-angle Diffusion Coefficient from Full-orbit Simulations: Disentangling a Rope of Sand</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b4a</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The pitch-angle diffusion coefficient (PADC) quantifies the effect of pitch-angle scattering on charged particles propagating through turbulent magnetic fields and is a key ingredient in understanding the diffusion of these particles along the background magnetic field. Despite its significance, only a limited number of studies have calculated the PADC from test-particle simulations in synthetic magnetic turbulence, employing various, often quite different, techniques for this purpose. In this study, we undertake a comparative analysis of nine different methods for calculating the PADC from full-orbit simulations. Our objective is to find the strengths and limitations of each method and to determine the most reliable approach. Although all nine methods should theoretically yield comparable results, certain methods may be ill-suited for numerical investigations, while others may not be applicable under conditions of strong turbulence. Through this investigation, we aim to provide recommendations for best practices when employing these methods in future numerical studies of pitch-angle scattering.

<title>JWST/MIRI Detection of a Carbon-rich Chemistry in the Disk of a Solar Nebula Analog</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b4f</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b4f</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
It has been proposed, and confirmed by multiple observations, that disks around low-mass stars display a molecule-rich emission and carbon-rich disk chemistry as compared to their hotter, more massive solar counterparts. In this work, we present JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey MIRI-MRS observations of the solar-mass star DoAr 33, a low-accretion rate T Tauri star showing an exceptional carbon-rich inner disk. We report detections of H2O, OH, and CO2, as well as the more complex hydrocarbons, C2H2 and C4H2. Through the use of thermochemical models, we explore different spatial distributions of carbon and oxygen across the inner disk and compare the column densities and temperatures obtained from LTE slab model retrievals. We find the best match to the observed column densities with models that have carbon enrichment, and the retrieved emitting temperature and area of C2H2 with models that have C/O = 2–4 inside the 500 K carbon-rich dust sublimation line. This suggests that the origin of the carbon-rich chemistry is likely due to the sublimation of carbon-rich grains near the soot line. This would be consistent with the presence of dust processing as indicated by the detection of crystalline silicates. We propose that this long-lived hydrocarbon-rich chemistry observed around a solar-mass star is a consequence of the unusually low M-star-like accretion rate of the central star, which lengthens the radial mixing timescale of the inner disk, allowing the chemistry powered by carbon grain destruction to linger.

<title>SCExAO/CHARIS Near-infrared Scattered-light Imaging and Integral Field Spectropolarimetry of the AB Aurigae Protoplanetary System</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8ba0</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8ba0</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We analyze near-infrared integral field spectropolarimetry of the AB Aurigae protoplanetary disk and protoplanet (AB Aur b), obtained with SCExAO/CHARIS in 22 wavelength channels covering the J, H, and K passbands (λ0 = 1.1–2.4 μm) over angular separations of ρ ≈ 0.″13 to 1.″1 (∼20–175 au). Our images resolve spiral structures in the disk in each CHARIS channel. At the longest wavelengths, the data may reveal an extension of the western spiral seen in previous polarimetric data at ρ < 0.″3 out to larger distances clockwise from the protoplanet AB Aur b, coincident with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array–detected CO gas spiral. While AB Aur b is detectable in complementary total intensity data, it is a nondetection in polarized light at λ > 1.3 μm. While the observed disk color is extremely red across JHK, the disk has a blue intrinsic scattering color consistent with small dust grains. The disk’s polarization spectrum is redder than AB Aur b’s total intensity spectrum. The polarization fraction peaks at ∼0.6 along the major disk axis. Radiative transfer modeling of the CHARIS data shows that small, porous dust grains with a porosity of p = 0.6–0.8 better reproduce the scattered-light appearance of the disk than more compact spheres (p = 0.3), especially the polarization fraction. This work demonstrates the utility of integral field spectropolarimetry to characterize structures in protoplanetary disks and elucidate the properties of the disks’ dust.

<title>Low-latitude Auroras: Insights from 2023 April 23 Solar Storm</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8dd3</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8dd3</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In 2023 April, a low-latitude aurora observed by the all-sky camera at Hanle, Ladakh, India (33°14’N geographic latitude), generated significant interest. This was the first such aurora recorded from the Indian region in the space era and occurred during a moderate solar storm. This study explores this low-latitude auroral sighting, which happened during the sheath-region passage of an interplanetary coronal mass ejection. We analyze in situ multispacecraft particle measurements and geomagnetic field observations from both ground-based and satellite-based magnetometers. The auroral observations at Hanle coincided with intense substorm activity. Our findings indicate that the aurora did not actually reach India; the equatorward boundary was beyond 50°N geographic latitude. Enhanced electron fluxes with energies below 100 eV were detected at 54°N geographic latitude at about 830 km altitude in the predawn sector (4–5 hr local time). In the midnight sector, the equatorward boundary is estimated to be around 52°N geographic latitude, based on Hanle observations and considering emission altitudes of 600–650 km due to low-energy electrons. Thus, the low-latitude red aurora observed from India resulted from the emissions at higher altitudes due to low-energy electron precipitation in the auroral oval and a slight equatorward expansion of the auroral oval. The low-energy electrons likely originated from the plasma sheet and were precipitated due to enhanced wave–particle interactions from strong magnetosphere compression during high solar wind pressure. This study is crucial in understanding low-latitude auroras in the modern space era.

<title>Large Dark Matter Content and Steep Metallicity Profile Predicted for Ultradiffuse Galaxies Formed in High-spin Halos</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8de8</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8de8</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the stellar properties of a sample of simulated ultradiffuse galaxies (UDGs) with stellar mass M⋆ = 107.5–109M⊙, selected from the TNG50 simulation, where UDGs form mainly in high-spin dwarf-mass halos. We divide our sample into star-forming and quenched UDGs, finding good agreement with the stellar assembly history measured in observations. Star-forming UDGs and quenched UDGs with M⋆ ≥ 108M⊙ in our sample are particularly inefficient at forming stars, having 2–10 times less stellar mass than non-UDGs for the same virial mass halo. These results are consistent with recent mass inferences in UDG samples and suggest that the most inefficient UDGs arise from a late assembly of the dark matter mass followed by a stellar growth that is comparatively slower (for star-forming UDGs) or that was interrupted due to environmental removal of the gas (for quenched UDGs). Regardless of efficiency, UDGs are 60% poorer in [Fe/H] than the population of non-UDGs at a fixed stellar mass, with the most extreme objects having metal content consistent with the simulated mass–metallicity relation at z ∼ 2. Quenched UDGs stop their star formation in shorter timescales than non-UDGs of similar mass and are, as a consequence, alpha enhanced with respect to non-UDGs. We identify metallicity profiles in UDGs as a potential avenue to distinguish between different formation paths for these galaxies, where gentle formation as a result of high-spin halos would present well-defined declining metallicity radial profiles while powerful-outflows or tidal stripping formation models would lead to flatter or constant metallicity as a function of radius due to the inherent mixing of stellar orbits.

<title>Artificial Polytropic Behavior of Plasmas Determined from the Application of Chi-squared Minimization Analysis to Data with Significant Statistical Uncertainty</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8f35</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8f35</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The effective polytropic index of plasmas is typically determined from the analysis of the plasma temperature (or pressure) and density, which are plasma bulk parameters determined from analyses of in situ plasma observations. Here, we show that the use of the typical chi-squared minimization method in plasma observation analyses results in artificial correlations between the plasma density and temperature, which will introduce errors in the determination of the plasma polytropic relationship. We quantify this potential error by analyzing simulated plasma observations. We specifically show that even in cases of nonvarying plasma, a significant statistical uncertainty in the observations leads to the determination of plasma parameters, which seemingly follow a nearly adiabatic model. Moreover, we consider isobaric plasma variations and discuss the error in the determined polytropic relationship as a function of the actual plasma variations and the statistical uncertainties of the determined parameters. We finally show that the use of an alternative analysis method improves the accuracy of the results.

<title>On the Origins, Remnant, and Multimessenger Prospects of the Compact Binary Merger GW230529</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study investigates the origins of GW230529, delving into its formation from massive stars within isolated binary systems. Utilizing population-synthesis models, we present compelling evidence that the neutron star component forms second. However, the event’s low signal-to-noise ratio introduces complexities in identifying the underlying physical mechanisms driving its formation. Augmenting our analysis with insights from numerical relativity, we estimate the final black hole mass and spin to be approximately 5.3 M⊙ and 0.53, respectively. Furthermore, we employ the obtained posterior samples to calculate the ejecta mass and kilonova light curves resulting from r-process nucleosynthesis. We find the ejecta mass to be within 0–0.06 M⊙, contingent on the neutron star equation of state. The peak brightness of the kilonova light curves indicates that targeted follow-up observations with a Rubin-like observatory may have detected this emission.

<title>Size Growth on Short Timescales of Star-forming Galaxies: Insights from Size Variation with Rest-frame Wavelength with JADES</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad919a</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad919a</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate size variation with rest-frame wavelength for star-forming galaxies based on the second James Webb Space Telescope Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey data release. Star-forming galaxies are typically smaller at longer wavelengths from the UV to the near-IR at z < 3.5, especially for more massive galaxies, indicating the inside-out assembly with in situ star formation if ignoring dust attenuation. The size variation with wavelength shows a strong dependence on stellar mass and shows little or no dependence on redshift, specific star formation rate, and galaxy environment. This suggests that the size growth of star-forming galaxies is a self-regulated process primarily governed by stellar mass. We model size as a function of both mass and redshift simultaneously, obtaining at a wavelength of 0.45 μm, and at 1.0 μm. Based on this size evolution and the star formation main sequence from the literature, we obtain the locus of typical size growth for individual galaxies of different masses on the mass–size plane. The moving trend of galaxies on the mass–size plane, which indicates the slopes of their locus, strongly correlates with the size ratio between 0.45 μm and 1.0 μm, supporting the idea that the size variation with wavelength provides important information on the size growth of galaxies on short timescales.

<title>Investigation of the Nonthermal X-Ray Emission from the Supernova Remnant CTB 37B Hosting the Magnetar CXOU J171405.7-381031</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad938c</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad938c</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a detailed X-ray investigation of a region (S1) exhibiting nonthermal X-ray emission within the supernova remnant (SNR) CTB 37B hosting the magnetar CXOU J171405.7−381031. Previous analyses modeled this emission with a power law (PL), inferring various values for the photon index (Γ) and absorbing column density (NH). Based on these, S1 was suggested to be an SNR shell, a background pulsar wind nebula, or an interaction region between the SNR and a molecular cloud. Our analysis of a larger data set favors a steepening (broken or curved PL) spectrum over a straight PL, with the best-fit broken power-law (BPL) parameters of Γ = 1.23 ± 0.23 and 2.24 ± 0.16 below and above a break at 5.57 ± 0.52 keV, respectively. However, a simple PL or srcut model cannot be definitively ruled out. For the BPL model, the inferred NH = (4.08 ± 0.72) × 1022 cm−2 towards S1 is consistent with that of the SNR, suggesting a physical association. The BPL-inferred spectral break ΔΓ ≈ 1 and hard Γ can be naturally explained by a nonthermal bremsstrahlung (NTB) model. We present an evolutionary NTB model that reproduces the observed spectrum, which indicates the presence of subrelativistic electrons within S1. However, alternate explanations for S1, an unrelated PWN or the SNR shock with unusually efficient acceleration, cannot be ruled out. We discuss these explanations and their implications for gamma-ray emission from CTB 37B and describe future observations that could settle the origin of S1.

[O ii] emission maps obtained with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager are presented for four galaxies centered in cooling X-ray cluster atmospheres. Nebular emission extending over tens of kiloparsecs is found in systems covering a broad range of atmospheric cooling rates, cluster masses, and dynamical states. A262's central galaxy hosts a kiloparsec-scale disk. The nebular gas in RX J0820.9+0752 is offset and redshifted with respect to the central galaxy by 10–20 kpc and 150 km s−1, respectively. The nebular gases in PKS 0745−191 and A1835 are being churned to higher velocity dispersion by X-ray bubbles and jets. The churned gas is enveloped by larger-scale, lower-velocity-dispersion (quiescent) nebular emission. The mean line-of-sight speeds of the churned gas, quiescent gas, and the central galaxy each differ by up to ∼150 km s−1; nebular speeds upward of 800 km s−1 are found. Gases with outwardly rising speeds upward of several hundred kilometers per second are consistent with being advected behind and being lifted by the rising bubbles. The peculiar motion between the galaxy, nebular gas, and perhaps the hot atmosphere from which it presumably condensed is affecting the bubble dynamics and may strongly affect thermally unstable cooling, the dispersal of jet energy, and the angular momentum of gas accreting onto the galaxies and their nuclear black holes.

<title>Cosmic-Ray North–South Anisotropy: Rigidity Spectrum and Solar Cycle Variations Observed by Ground-based Muon Detectors</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8577</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The north–south (NS) anisotropy of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) is dominated by a diamagnetic drift flow of GCRs in the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), allowing us to derive key parameters of cosmic-ray propagation, such as the density gradient and diffusion coefficient. We propose a new method to analyze the rigidity spectrum of GCR anisotropy and reveal a solar cycle variation of the NS anisotropy’s spectrum using ground-based muon detectors in Nagoya, Japan, and Hobart, Australia. The physics-based correction method for the atmospheric temperature effect on muons is used to combine the different-site detectors free from local atmospheric effects. NS channel pairs in the multidirectional muon detectors are formed to enhance sensitivity to the NS anisotropy, and in this process, general graph matching in graph theory is introduced to survey optimized pairs. Moreover, Bayesian estimation with the Gaussian process allows us to unfold the rigidity spectrum without supposing any analytical function for the spectral shape. Thanks to these novel approaches, it has been discovered that the rigidity spectrum of the NS anisotropy is dynamically varying with solar activity every year. It is attributed to a rigidity-dependent variation of the radial density gradient of GCRs based on the nature of the diamagnetic drift in the IMF. The diffusion coefficient and mean free path length of GCRs as functions of the rigidity are also derived from the diffusion–convection flow balance. This analysis expands the estimation limit of the mean free path length into the ≤200 GV rigidity region from the <10 GV region achieved by solar energetic particle observations.

<title>The AH Pictoris Syndrome: Continuous Trains of Stunted Outbursts in Novalike Variables</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8c39</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Novalike variables are a subgroup of cataclysmic variables (CVs) that—unlike dwarf novae—do not exhibit strong brightenings in their long-term light curves. Variations over timescales of weeks, months, or years are mostly restricted to irregular low-amplitude modulations. However, some of them occasionally suffer from so-called stunted outbursts, that is, small-scale brightenings of less than a magnitude lasting for a couple of days to weeks. There is no consensus about the physical mechanisms behind these outbursts. Here I discuss the common properties of a group of novalike variables (which I call AH Pictoris (AH Pic) stars after its most prominent member) that exhibit a continuous train of successive stunted outbursts over their entire observational history, or at least for several years. The outburst amplitudes are stable in a given system, always ranging between 0.5 and 1 mag in the visual band. The outburst intervals, at an overall range between 12 and 30 days, and the outburst profiles can gradually evolve, but no sudden changes are observed. On shorter timescales the orbital waveforms are not only surprisingly similar, but also evolve in the same way over the outburst cycle. All AH Pic stars have absolute visual magnitudes in the overlap region between the absolute magnitudes of all novalike variables and of quiescent dwarf novae above the CV period gap. So far, I identified seven novalike variables with the consistent photometric behavior that may be termed the AH Pic syndrome. Several more systems may be related objects. The relationship of the AH Pic stars to the anomalous Z Cam stars is discussed.

<title>Insight-HXMT View of the Black Hole Candidate Swift J1727.8–1613 during Its Outburst in 2023</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8dc4</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The transient Galactic black hole candidate Swift J1727.8-1613 went through an outburst for the very first time in 2023 August and lasted for almost 6 months. We study the timing and spectral properties of this source using publicly available archival Insight-HXMT data for the first 10 observation IDs that last from MJD 60181 to 60198 with a total of 92 exposures for each of the three energy bands. We have detected quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in a frequency range of 0.21 ± 0.01–1.86 ± 0.01 Hz by fitting the power density spectrum. Based on the model-fitted parameters and properties of the QPOs, we classify them as type C in nature. We also conclude that the origin of the QPOs could be the shock instabilities in the transonic advective accretion flows around black holes. The spectral analysis was performed using simultaneous data from the three onboard instruments LE, ME, and HE of Insight-HXMT in the broad energy band of 2−150 keV. To achieve the best fit, spectral fitting required a combination of models, e.g., interstellar absorption, power-law, multicolor disk–blackbody continuum, Gaussian emission/absorption, and reflection by neutral material. From the spectral properties, we found that the source was in an intermediate state at the start of the analysis period and was transitioning to the softer states. The inner edge of the accretion disk moved inward in progressive days following the spectral nature. We found that the source has a high inclination of 78°−86°. The hydrogen column density from the model fitting varied in the range of (0.12 ± 0.02−0.39 ± 0.08) × 1022 cm−2.

<title>[X/Fe] Marks the Spot: Mapping Chemical Azimuthal Variations in the Galactic Disk with APOGEE</title>

Chemical cartography of the Galactic disk provides insights into its structure and assembly history over cosmic time. In this work, we use chemical cartography to explore chemical gradients and azimuthal substructure in the Milky Way disk with giant stars from Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) DR17. We confirm the existence of a radial metallicity gradient in the disk of Δ[Fe/H]/ΔR ∼ –0.0678 ± 0.0004 dex kpc−1 and a vertical metallicity gradient of Δ[Fe/H]/ΔZ ∼ −0.164 ± 0.001. We find azimuthal variations (±0.1 dex) on top of the radial metallicity gradient that have been previously established with other surveys. The APOGEE giants show strong correlations with stellar age and the intensity of azimuthal variations in [Fe/H]; young populations and intermediate-aged populations both show significant deviations from the radial metallicity gradient, while older stellar populations show the largest deviations from the radial metallicity gradient. Beyond iron, we show that other elements (e.g., Mg, O) display azimuthal variations at the ±0.05 dex level across the Galactic disk. We illustrate that moving into the orbit-space could help constrain the mechanisms producing these azimuthal metallicity variations in the future. These results suggest that dynamical processes play an important role in the formation of azimuthal metallicity variations.

<title>Kinematic Analysis of z = 4.3 Galaxies in the SPT2349–56 Protocluster Core</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad7bb4</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
SPT2349−56 is a protocluster discovered in the 2500 deg2 South Pole Telescope (SPT) survey. In this paper, we study the kinematics of the galaxies found in the core of SPT2349−56 using high-resolution (1.55 kpc spatial resolution at z = 4.303) redshifted [C ii] 158 μm data. Using the publicly available code 3DBAROLO, we analyze the seven far-infrared brightest galaxies within the protocluster core. Based on conventional definitions for the detection of rotating disks, we classify six sources to be rotating disks in an actively star-forming protocluster environment, with weighted mean Vrot/σdisp = 4.5 ± 1.3. The weighted mean rotation velocity (Vrot) and velocity dispersion (σdisp) for the sample are 357.1 ± 114.7 km s−1 and 43.5 ± 23.5 km s−1, respectively. We also assess the disk stability of the galaxies and find a mean Toomre parameter of QT = 0.9 ± 0.3. The galaxies show a mild positive correlation between disk stability and dynamical support. Using the position–velocity maps, we find that five sources further classify as disturbed disks, and one classifies as a strictly rotating disk. Our sample joins several observations at similar redshift with high V/σ values, with the exception that they are morphologically disturbed, kinematically rotating, and interacting galaxies in an extreme protocluster environment.

<title>Plasma Waves Can Gain Energy from Neutrals in Partially Ionized Plasmas</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Partially ionized plasmas are widely present in astrophysical and space plasmas, and ion-neutral collisions have an important impact on the plasma dynamics, such as electrostatic wave propagation. In this work, the excitation and propagation characteristics of electrostatic ion cyclotron (EIC) waves were experimentally studied in a partially ionized plasma. The EIC waves were launched via a grid antenna, and two types of EIC waves were observed to be excited and propagated. In partially ionized plasmas with weak ion–neutral collisions, it was found that the EIC wave propagation is dominated by ion motion, resembling the classical EIC wave. However, in plasmas with strong ion–neutral collisions, experiments revealed for the first time that EIC wave propagation can be dominated by neutral motion, which leads to an increase in the collisional EIC wave’s phase velocity. Additionally, the EIC wave dispersion relationships under collisions were determined to reveal the underlying processes responsible for the observations. This work verified that collisional EIC waves can gain energy from neutrals in partially ionized plasmas, which suggests that ion‒neutral collisions in the Earth and planetary ionosphere and solar atmosphere have a more complex impact on plasma wave propagation than previously thought.

<title>Cross-correlation of Luminous Red Galaxies with Machine Learning Selected Active Galactic Nuclei in HSC-SSP: Unobscured AGN Residing in More Massive Halos</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are the signposts of black hole growth, and likely play an important role in galaxy evolution. An outstanding question is whether AGN of different spectral types indicate different evolutionary stages in the coevolution of black holes and galaxies. We present the angular correlation function between an AGN sample selected from Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) optical photometry and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer mid-IR photometry and a luminous red galaxy (LRG) sample from HSC-SSP. We investigate AGN clustering strength as a function of luminosity and spectral features across three independent HSC fields totaling ∼600 deg2, for z ∈ 0.6 −1.2 and AGN with L6 μm > 3 × 1044 erg s−1. There are ∼28,500 AGN and ∼1.5 million LRGs in our primary analysis. We determine the average halo mass for the full AGN sample (Mh ≈ 1012.9 h−1M⊙), and note that it does not evolve significantly as a function of redshift (over this narrow range) or luminosity. We find that, on average, unobscured AGN (Mh ≈ 1013.3 h−1M⊙) occupy ∼4.5× more massive halos than obscured AGN (Mh ≈ 1012.6 h−1M⊙), at 5σ statistical significance using 1D uncertainties, and at 3σ using the full covariance matrix, suggesting a physical difference between unobscured and obscured AGN, beyond the line-of-sight viewing angle. Furthermore, we find evidence for a halo mass dependence on reddening level within the Type I AGN population, which could support the existence of a dust-obscured phase. However, we also find that quite small systematic shifts in the redshift distributions of the AGN sample could explain current and previously observed differences in Mh.

<title>Modeling Multiple X-Ray Reflection in Super-Eddington Winds</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad86c0</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
It has been recently discovered that a few super-Eddington sources undergoing black hole super-Eddington accretion exhibit X-ray reflection signatures. In such new systems, one expects the coronal X-ray emissions to be mainly reflected by optically thick super-Eddington winds instead of thin disks. In this paper, we conduct a series of general-relativistic ray-tracing and Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations to model the X-ray reflection signatures, especially the characteristic Fe Kα line, produced from super-Eddington accretion flows around nonspinning black holes. In particular, we allow the photons emitted by a lamppost corona to be reflected multiple times in a cone-like funnel surrounded by fast winds. We find that the Fe Kα line profile most sensitively depends on the wind kinematics, while its exact shape also depends on the funnel open angle and corona height. Furthermore, very interestingly, we find that the Fe Kα line can have a prominent double-peak profile in certain parameter spaces, even with a face-on orientation. Moreover, we compare the Fe Kα line profiles produced from super-Eddington and thin disks and show that such lines can provide important insights into the understanding of black hole systems undergoing super-Eddington accretion.

<title>A Case Study of Gas Impacted by Black-hole Jets with the JWST: Outflows, Bow Shocks, and High Excitation of the Gas in the Galaxy IC 5063</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present James Webb Space Telescope MIRI data of the inner ∼3 × 2 kpc2 of the galaxy IC 5063, in which the jets of a supermassive black hole interact with the gaseous disk they are crossing. Jet-driven outflows were known to be initiated along or near the jet path and to modify the stability of molecular clouds, possibly altering their star formation properties. The MIRI data, of unprecedented resolution and sensitivity in the infrared, now reveal that there are more than 10 discrete regions with outflows, nearly doubling the number of such known regions. Outflows exist near the radio lobes, at the nucleus, in a biconical structure perpendicular to the jet, and in a bubble moving against the disk. In some of them, velocities above escape velocity are observed. Stratification is also observed, with higher ionization or excitation gas attaining higher velocities. More outflows and bow shocks, found further away from the nucleus than the radio lobes, in regions without significant radio emission, reveal the existence of past or weak radio jets that interacted with the interstellar medium. The coincidence of the bow shocks with the optical extended emission line region (EELR) suggests that the jets also contributed to the gas ionization. Maps of the H2 gas excitation temperature, Tex, indicate that the molecular gas is most excited in regions with radio emission. There, Tex is >100 K higher than in the EELR interior. We argue that a combination of jet-related shocks and cosmic rays is likely responsible for this excess molecular gas excitation.

<title>Temporal and Spectral Analysis of the Unique and Second-brightest Gamma-Ray Burst GRB 230307A: Insights from GECAM and Fermi/GBM Observations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this study, we present the pulse profile of the unique and the second-brightest gamma-ray burst GRB 230307A, and analyze its temporal behavior using a joint GECAM–Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) time-resolved spectral analysis. The utilization of GECAM data is advantageous as it successfully captured significant data during the pileup period of the Fermi/GBM. We investigate the evolution of its flux, photon fluence, photon flux, peak energy, and the corresponding hardness–intensity and hardness–flux correlations. The findings within the first 27 s exhibit consistent patterns reported previously, providing valuable insights for comparing observations with predictions from the synchrotron radiation model invoking an expanding shell. Beyond the initial 27 s, we observe a notable transition in the emitted radiation, attributed to high-latitude emission, influenced by the geometric properties of the shells and the relativistic Doppler effects. By modeling the data within the framework of the large-radius internal shock model, we discuss the required parameters as well as the limitations of the model. We conclude that a more complicated synchrotron emission model is needed to fully describe the observational data of GRB 230307A.

<title>Deep Einstein@Home Search for Continuous Gravitational Waves from the Central Compact Objects in the Supernova Remnants Vela Jr. and G347.3-0.5 Using LIGO Public Data</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b9e</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We perform a search for continuous nearly monochromatic gravitational waves from the central compact objects associated with the supernova remnants Vela Jr. and G347.3. Over 1018 different waveforms are considered, covering signal frequencies between 20 and 1300 Hz (20 and 400 Hz) for G347.3-0.5 (Vela Jr.) and a very broad range of frequency derivatives. The data set used for this first search is from the second observing run of LIGO (O2). Thousands of volunteers donating compute cycles through the computing project Einstein@Home have made this endeavor possible. Following the Einstein@Home search, we perform multistage follow-ups of over 5 million waveforms. The threshold for selecting candidates from the Einstein@Home search is such that, after the multistage follow-up, we do not expect any surviving candidate due to noise. The very last stage uses a different data set, namely, the LIGO O3 data. We find no significant signal candidate for either targets. Based on this null result, for G347.3-0.5, we set the most constraining upper limits to date on the amplitude of gravitational-wave signals, corresponding to deformations below 10−6 in a large part of the search band. At the frequency of best strain sensitivity, near 161 Hz, we set 90% confidence upper limits on the gravitational-wave intrinsic amplitude of . Over most of the frequency range, our upper limits are a factor of 10 smaller than the indirect age-based upper limit. For Vela Jr., near 163 Hz, we set . Over most of the frequency range, our upper limits are a factor of 15 smaller than the indirect age-based upper limit. The Vela Jr. upper limits presented here are slightly less constraining than the most recent upper limits of R. Abbott et al., but they apply to a broader set of signals.

<title>SN 2021foa: The “Flip-flop” Type IIn/Ibn Supernova</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8cd3</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8cd3</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a comprehensive analysis of the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of SN 2021foa, unique among the class of transitional supernovae for repeatedly changing its spectroscopic appearance from hydrogen-to-helium-to-hydrogen dominated (IIn-to-Ibn-to-IIn) within 50 days past peak brightness. The spectra exhibit multiple narrow (≈300–600 km s−1) absorption lines of hydrogen, helium, calcium, and iron together with broad helium emission lines with a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of ∼6000 km s−1. For a steady, wind mass-loss regime, light-curve modeling results in an ejecta mass of ∼8 M⊙ and circumstellar material (CSM) mass below 1 M⊙, and an ejecta velocity consistent with the FWHM of the broad helium lines. We obtain a mass-loss rate of ≈2 M⊙ yr−1. This mass-loss rate is 3 orders of magnitude larger than derived for normal Type II supernovae. We estimate that the bulk of the CSM of SN 2021foa must have been expelled within half a year, about 12 yr ago. Our analysis suggests that SN 2021foa had a helium-rich ejecta that swept up a dense shell of hydrogen-rich CSM shortly after explosion. At about 60 days past peak brightness, the photosphere recedes through the dense ejecta-CSM region, occulting much of the redshifted emission of the hydrogen and helium lines, which results in an observed blueshift (∼−3000 km s−1). Strong mass-loss activity prior to explosion, such as those seen in SN 2009ip-like objects and SN 2021foa as precursor emission, are the likely origin of a complex, multiple-shell CSM close to the progenitor star.

<title>Weighing Single-lined Spectroscopic Binaries Using Tidal Effects on Radial Velocities: The Case of V723 Monocerotis</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8cdd</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8cdd</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In single-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB1s) where flux variations due to tidal deformation of the primary star (ellipsoidal variations, EVs) are detected, the binary mass can be determined by combining EVs with the primary's radial velocity (RV) variations from orbital motion and information about the primary’s radius. This method has been used for mass estimation in close binaries including X-ray systems, but it has been pointed out that contaminating light from sources other than the primary star could introduce systematic errors in the mass and inclination estimates. Here, we focus on the apparent RV variations caused by asymmetric distortion of the absorption lines of the tidally deformed primary star (tidal RV). Because this signal contains information equivalent to that from photometric EVs, it enables mass estimation of the binary system using only the primary star’s absorption lines from high-resolution spectroscopic data, providing a potentially more robust approach against contaminating light. We apply the method to the binary system V723 Monocerotis, where both photometric EV and tidal RV signals are detected and successfully determine the component masses using only the primary star’s RVs and projected rotational velocity, without relying on absolute flux measurements or stellar evolutionary models. The masses derived from the tidal RV model shows a reasonable agreement with those obtained from EVs after carefully modeling the flux contamination from the secondary. This result demonstrates that tidal RVs provide a useful alternative means for mass estimation in SB1s.

<title>Global Simulation of the Solar Wind: A Comparison with Parker Solar Probe Observations during 2018–2022</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8d54</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8d54</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models play an important role in the infrastructure of space weather forecasting. Validating such models commonly utilizes in situ solar wind measurements made near the Earth’s orbit. The purpose of this study is to test the performance of G3DMHD (a data driven, time-dependent, 3D MHD model of the solar wind) with Parker Solar Probe (PSP) measurements. Since its launch in 2018 August, PSP has traversed the inner heliosphere at different radial distances sunward of the Earth (the closest approach ∼13.3 R⊙), thus providing a good opportunity to study evolution of the solar wind and to validate heliospheric models of the solar wind. The G3DMHD model simulation is driven by a sequence of maps of the photospheric field extrapolated to the assumed source surface (2.5 R⊙) using the potential field model from 2018 to 2022, which covers the first 15 PSP orbits. The Pearson correlation coefficient (cc) and the mean absolute scaled error (MASE) are used as the metrics to evaluate the model performance. It is found that the model performs better for both magnetic intensity (cc = 0.75; MASE = 0.60) and the solar wind density (cc = 0.73; MASE = 0.50) than for the solar wind speed (cc = 0.15; MASE = 1.29) and temperature (cc = 0.28; MASE = 1.14). This is due primarily to lack of accurate boundary conditions. The well-known underestimate of the magnetic field in solar minimum years is also present. Assuming that the radial magnetic field becomes uniformly distributed with latitude at or below 18 R⊙ (the inner boundary of the computation domain), the agreement in the magnetic intensity significantly improves (cc = 0.83; MASE = 0.49).

<title>Supernova Shocks in Molecular Clouds: Shocks Driven into Dense Cores in IC 443 and 3C 391</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Supernova shocks into dense molecular cores in IC 443 (clumps B, C, and G) and 3C 391 were observed using the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy and complemented by archival data from the Herschel Space Observatory. The pure rotational transitions 0–0 S(1) and S(5) of H2, and the ground-state 110–101 transition of H2O, are all broadened, arising from molecules that survive the passage of the shock front. Theoretical models from the Paris–Durham shock code were analyzed to generate velocity profiles that approximately match the observations. The observations can be fit with two shock conditions, which approximate the range of densities in the preshock molecular cloud. The width and brightness of the S(5) lines require shocks into gas with a density of order 2000 cm−3, into which the IC 443 blast wave drives shocks with speed 60 km s−1. The brightness and narrower width of the S(1) lines requires different shocks, into gas with density of order 105 cm−3, with shock speeds of 10 km s−1. The H2O velocity distribution is also consistent with these shocks. The existence of shocks into dense gas shows that the bright shocked clumps in IC 443 were prestellar cores. It is unlikely that they will form stars soon after the passage of the shock front, given the input of kinetic and thermal energy from the shocks.

The near-horizon region of a black hole impacts linear (LP) and circular polarization (CP) through strong lensing of photons, adding large-scale symmetries and anti-symmetries to the polarized image. To probe the signature of lensing in polarimetry, we utilize a geometric model of concentric Gaussian rings of equal radius to investigate the transition in the Fourier plane at which the photon ring signal begins to dominate over the direct image. We find analytic, closed-form expressions for the transition radii in total intensity, LP, and CP, wherein the resultant formulae are composed of ratios of tunable image parameters, with the overall “scale” set primarily by the thickness of the direct image. Using these formulae, we compute the transition radii for time-averaged images of M87* simulations at 230 GHz, studying both magnetically arrested disk (MAD) and standard and normal evolution configurations for various spin and electron heating models. We compare geometric values to radii obtained directly from the simulations through a coherent averaging scheme. We find that nearly all MAD models have a photon ring-dominated CP signal on long baselines shorter than Earth's diameter at 230 GHz. Across favored models for the M87* accretion flow identified by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) polarimetric constraints, we quantify the sensitivity and antenna size requirements for the next-generation EHT and the Black Hole Explorer orbiter to detect these features. We find that the stringent requirements for CP favor explorations using long baselines on the ground, while LP remains promising on Earth-space baselines.

<title>Proton Acceleration in Low-β Magnetic Reconnection with Energetic Particle Feedback</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Magnetic reconnection regions in space and astrophysics are known as active particle acceleration sites. There is ample evidence showing that energetic particles can take a substantial amount of converted energy during magnetic reconnection. However, there has been a lack of studies understanding the backreaction of energetic particles at magnetohydrodynamical scales in magnetic reconnection. To address this, we have developed a new computational method to explore the feedback by nonthermal energetic particles. This approach considers the backreaction from these energetic particles by incorporating their pressure into magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. The pressure of the energetic particles is evaluated from their distribution evolved through Parker’s transport equation, solved using stochastic differential equations (SDEs), so we coin the name MHD-SDE. Applying this method to low-β magnetic reconnection simulations, we find that reconnection is capable of accelerating a large fraction of energetic particles that contain a substantial amount of energy. When the feedback from these particles is included, their pressure suppresses the compression structures generated by magnetic reconnection, thereby mediating particle energization. Consequently, the feedback from energetic particles results in a steeper power-law energy spectrum. These findings suggest that feedback from nonthermal energetic particles plays a crucial role in magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration.

<title>Formation of Sub-Chandrasekhar-mass Black Holes and Red Stragglers via Hawking Stars in Ultrafaint Dwarf Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid mass window from 10−16M⊙ to 10−10M⊙ are currently a popular dark matter candidate. If they exist, some stars would capture them upon formation, and they would slowly accrete the star over gigayears. Such Hawking stars—stars with a central PBH—provide a novel channel for the formation of both sub-Chandrasekhar-mass black holes and red straggler stars. Here we report on stellar evolution models that extend our previous work to Hawking stars with masses between 0.5 and 1.4 M⊙. We explore three accretion schemes, and find that a wide range of PBHs in the asteroid mass window can robustly accrete stars as small as 1 M⊙ within the age of the Universe. This mechanism of producing subsolar-mass black holes is highly dependent on the assumed accretion physics and stellar metallicity. Lower-metallicity stars are generally accreted more rapidly, suggesting that it may be more likely for sub-Chandrasekhar-mass Hawking stars formed in the early Universe, such as those in ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxies, to transmute their star into a sub-Chandrasekhar-mass black hole within a Hubble time. We present a stellar population synthesis of a Draco II–like UFD galaxy containing Hawking stars and show that the number of red stragglers they produce can qualitatively match the observed population for black hole seed masses around 10−11M⊙ and under the assumption that they accrete with high radiative efficiency.

Proxima Cen (GJ 551; dM5.5e) is one of only about a dozen fully convective stars known to have a stellar cycle, and the only one to have long-term X-ray monitoring. A previous analysis found that X-ray and mid-UV observations, particularly two epochs of data from Swift, were consistent with a well-sampled ∼7 yr optical cycle seen in All Sky Automated Survey project (ASAS) data, but not convincing by themselves. The present work incorporates several years of new ASAS-SN optical data and an additional 5 yr of Swift XRT and UVOT observations, with Swift observations now spanning 2009–2021 and optical coverage from late 2000. X-ray observations by XMM-Newton and Chandra are also included. Analysis of the combined data, which includes modeling and adjustments for stellar contamination in the optical and UV, now reveals clear cyclic behavior in all three wavebands with a period of 8.0 yr. We also show that UV and X-ray intensities are anticorrelated with optical brightness variations caused by the cycle and by rotational modulation, discuss possible indications of two coronal mass ejections, and provide updated results for the previous finding of a simple correlation between X-ray cycle amplitude and Rossby number over a wide range of stellar types and ages.

<title>Center-to-limb Variations in Solar Plage Using IRIS Observations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad901d</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The center-to-limb variations (CLV) of transition region line Gaussian fit parameters in solar plage are reported for the first time. The Si iv 1402.77 Å line observed by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph is used. The spectral intensity increases linearly from the disk center to the solar limb. Similarly, the nonthermal velocity also increases linearly from 23.6 (at the disk center) to 30.9 km s−1 (at the solar limb). On the other hand, the Doppler velocity decreases from 8.9 ± 1.0 at the disk center to 0.0 km s−1 at the limb. This CLV pattern in solar plages is consistent with the CLV pattern reported in the quiet Sun (QS). However, the average values of the parameters in the solar plage are significantly higher than in the QS. The intensity and nonthermal velocity increase linearly with the magnetic field at the disk center, while the Doppler velocity does not depend on the magnetic field. Due to the line-of-sight effect, the plasma column depth increases toward the solar limb, which leads to a linear increase in the spectral intensity. Further, the increasing plasma column depth toward the solar limb adds more and more unresolved motions, and as a result, the nonthermal velocity increases from the disk center to the solar limb. In the solar plages, the higher plasma density due to the strong magnetic field leads to higher intensity and nonthermal velocity compared to the QS and coronal hole.

<title>A Compact, Coherent Representation of Stellar Surface Variation in the Spectral Domain</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Time-varying inhomogeneities on stellar surfaces constitute one of the largest sources of radial velocity (RV) error for planet detection and characterization. We show that stellar variations, because they manifest on coherent, rotating surfaces, give rise to changes that are complex but usably compact and coherent in the spectral domain. Methods for disentangling stellar signals in RV measurements benefit from modeling the full domain of spectral pixels. We simulate spectra of spotted stars using starry and construct a simple spectrum projection space that is sensitive to the orientation and size of stellar surface features. Regressing measured RVs in this projection space reduces RV scatter by 60%–80% while preserving planet shifts. We note that stellar surface variability signals do not manifest in spectral changes that are purely orthogonal to a Doppler shift or exclusively asymmetric in line profiles; enforcing orthogonality or focusing exclusively on asymmetric features will not make use of all the information present in the spectra. We conclude with a discussion of existing and possible implementations on real data based on the presented compact, coherent framework for stellar signal mitigation.

Free–free Gaunt factors for X-ray absorption by hot plasma in the presence of a strong magnetic field are reported. Modified formulae are used for application to the nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium conditions found in accreting pulsar atmospheres. Given upcoming global X-ray polarimetric space missions, these can be used for the construction of an absorption matrix in discrete-ordinate polarized radiative transfer.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The magnetic dynamo mechanism of giant stars remains an open question, which can be explored by investigating their activity–rotation relations with multiple proxies. By using the data from the LAMOST and Galaxy Evolution Explorer surveys, we carried out a comprehensive study of activity–rotation relations of evolved stars based on Ca ii H and K lines, Hα lines, and near-ultraviolet (NUV) emissions. Our results show that evolved stars and dwarfs obey a similar power law in the unsaturated region of the activity–rotation relation, indicating a common dynamo mechanism in both giants and dwarfs. There is no clear difference in the activity levels between red giant branch stars and red clump stars, nor between single giants and those in binaries. Additionally, our results show that the NUV activity levels of giants are comparable to those of G- and K-type dwarfs and are higher than those of M dwarfs.

<title>A Study of Slow-mode Shocks in the Near-Earth Magnetotail with MMS Observations and Hybrid Simulations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The structure of the magnetic reconnection boundary, particularly the presence of slow-mode shocks in the near-Earth magnetotail was studied by using magnetospheric multiscale (MMS) observations and 2.5D hybrid simulations. A total of 51 crossings of MMS from 2017 to 2021 were analyzed. We found that the detection percentage of slow-mode shocks in the near-Earth magnetotail is 41%–55%. Previous studies have only reported one slow-mode shock event in the near-Earth magnetotail and a slow-mode shock detection percentage of 10% or lower in the mid-to-distant magnetotail. It was observed that if the high-energy beam region data is removed from the slow-mode shock downstream observations then the detection of slow-mode shocks reduces, implying that the kinetic effects play an important role in the detection of slow-mode shocks. For the crossings where the interface was not identified as a slow-mode shock, it was found that the turbulence in those crossings can change the mass flux values and disrupt the detection of slow-mode shock. However, the macroscopic slow-mode shock-like structure stably exists around the magnetic reconnection interface, as most of the conditions for slow-mode shocks were satisfied. This result suggests that slow-mode shocks are a general feature of magnetic reconnection geometry. We find that the lack of detection of slow-mode shocks in previous observations and simulations can be explained by taking into account the kinetic structure of slow-mode shocks and the presence of turbulence.

<title>First Comparison of FLARIX Simulations with MSDP Observation of the C1.6 Solar Flare in the Hα Line of Hydrogen</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The primary objective of this study is to develop a time-dependent model of the flaring atmosphere based on observational data. Here, we present, for the first time, a comparison between numerical simulations of the flaring emission, specifically focusing on the hydrogen Hα line, utilizing the FLARIX code and spectral observations of a compact C1.6 GOES-class flare observed on 2012 September 10, by the MSDP imaging spectrograph installed at the Białków Observatory. The Multichannel Subtractive Double Pass imaging spectrograph spectral data, collected with a temporal resolution as fine as 50 ms, enabled a comprehensive analysis of Hα line profiles and light curves measured within an area of the flare’s emission. An initial atmospheric model close to VAL-C, with a modified temperature in the upper chromosphere, was employed in simulations. To enhance temporal resolution, modulations of the nonthermal electron (NTE) beam’s parameters were introduced based on variations in observed hard X-ray (HXR) flux (using RHESSI data). The synthesized Hα line profiles were compared with the observed spectra. During the impulsive phase of the flare, the evolution of the observed and synthetic Hα line intensity agrees, but discrepancies were found in intensities at specific wavelengths of the Hα line profile. Fluctuations in the energy flux of NTEs exhibited a strong correlation with the Hα emission during the HXR pulse. After considering various effects (such as the filling factor FF = 0.20) that could influence observed emissions, relatively good agreement between theoretical and observed lines was achieved.

<title>JWST Validates HST Distance Measurements: Selection of Supernova Subsample Explains Differences in JWST Estimates of Local H 0</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We cross-check the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Cepheid/Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) distance ladder, which yields the most precise local H0, against early James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) subsamples (∼1/4 of the HST sample) from SH0ES and CCHP, calibrated only with NGC 4258. We find HST Cepheid distances agree well (∼1σ) with all combinations of methods, samples, and telescopes. The comparisons explicitly include the measurement uncertainty of each method in NGC 4258, an oft-neglected but dominant term. Mean differences are ∼0.03 mag, far smaller than the 0.18 mag “Hubble tension.” Combining all measures produces the strongest constraint yet on the linearity of HST Cepheid distances, 0.994 ±0.010, ruling out distance-dependent bias or offset as the source of the tension at ∼7σ. However, current JWST subsamples produce large sampling differences in H0 whose size and direction we can directly estimate from the full HST set. We show that ΔH0 ∼ 2.5 km s−1 Mpc−1 between the CCHP JWST program and the full HST sample is entirely consistent with differences in sample selection. We combine all JWST samples into a new distance-limited set of 16 SNe Ia at D ≤ 25 Mpc. Using JWST Cepheids, JAGB, and tip of the red giant branch, we find 73.4 ± 2.1, 72.2 ± 2.2, and 72.1 ± 2.2 km s−1 Mpc−1, respectively. Explicitly accounting for common supernovae, the three-method JWST result is H0 = 72.6 ± 2.0, similar to H0 = 72.8 expected from HST Cepheids in the same galaxies. The small JWST sample trivially lowers the Hubble tension significance due to small-sample statistics and is not yet competitive with the HST set (42 SNe Ia and 4 anchors), which yields 73.2 ± 0.9. Still, the joint JWST sample provides important cross-checks that the HST data pass.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The afterglow of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been extensively discussed in the context of shocks generated during an interaction of relativistic outflows with their ambient medium. This process leads to the formation of both a forward and a reverse shock. While the emission from the forward shock, observed off-axis, has been well-studied as a potential electromagnetic counterpart to a gravitational-wave-detected merger, the contribution of the reverse shock is commonly overlooked. In this paper, we investigate the contribution of the reverse shock to the GRB afterglows observed off-axis. In our analysis, we consider jets with different angular profiles, including two-component jets, power-law structured jets, Gaussian jets, and “mixed jets” featuring a Poynting-flux-dominated core surrounded by a baryonic wing. We apply our model to GRB 170817A/GW170817 and employ the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to obtain model parameters. Our findings suggest that the reverse shock emission can significantly contribute to the early afterglow. In addition, our calculations indicate that the light curves observable in future off-axis GRBs may exhibit either double peaks or a single peak with a prominent feature, depending on the jet structure, viewing angle, and microphysics shock parameters.

<title>X-Ray Spectroscopy of the Dwarf Nova Z Chamaeleontis in Quiescence and Outburst Using the XMM-Newton Observatory</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad85e5</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present X-ray spectroscopy of the SU UMa–type dwarf nova Z Chamaeleontis using the European Photon Imaging Camera and reflection grating spectrometer (RGS) instruments on board the XMM-Newton observatory. The quiescent system can be modeled by collisional equilibrium (CIE) or nonequilibrium plasma models, yielding a kT of 8.2–13.0 keV at a luminosity of (5.0–6.0) × 1030 erg s−1. The spectra yield better using partially covering absorbers of cold and/or photoionized nature. The ionized absorber has an equivalent NH = (3.4–5.9) × 1022 cm−2 and a log(ξ) = 3.5–3.7 with a (50–60)% covering fraction when the VNEI model (XSPEC) is used. The line diagnosis in quiescence shows no resonance lines, with only the forbidden lines of Ne, Mg, and Si detected. The H-like C, O, Ne, and Mg are detected. The strongest line is O viii, with (2.7–4.6) × 10−14 erg s−1 cm−2. The quiescent X-ray-emitting plasma is not collisional and not in ionization equilibrium, which is consistent with hot ADAF-like accretion flows. The line diagnosis in the outburst shows He-like O and Ne, with intercombination lines being the strongest, along with weaker resonance lines. This indicates the plasma is more collisional and denser, but not yet in CIE, revealing ionization timescales of (0.97–1.4) × 1011 s cm−3. The R ratios in the outburst yield electron densities of (7–90) × 1011 cm−3 and the G ratios yield electron temperatures of (2–3) × 106 K. The outburst luminosity is (1.4–2.5) × 1030 erg s−1. The flow is inhomogeneous in density. All detected lines are narrow, with widths limited by the resolution of RGS, yielding Keplerian rotational velocities <1000 km s−1. This is too low for boundary layers, consistent with the nature of ADAF-like hot flows.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Observations suggest that filaments in molecular clouds can grow by mass accretion while forming cores via fragmentation. Here, we present one of the first large-sample studies of filament accretion using velocity gradient measurements of star-forming filaments on the ∼0.05 pc scale with NH3 observations of the Perseus Molecular Cloud, primarily obtained as a part of the Green Bank Ammonia Survey. In this study, we find significant correlations between the velocity gradient, velocity dispersion, mass per unit length, and number of cores per unit length of the Perseus filaments. Our results suggest a scenario in which filaments not only grow through mass accretion, but also form new cores continuously in the process, well into the thermally supercritical regime. Such behavior is contrary to that expected from isolated filament models but consistent with how filaments form within a more realistic cloud environment, suggesting that the cloud environment plays a crucial role in shaping core formation and evolution in filaments. Furthermore, even though velocity gradients within filaments are not oriented randomly, we find no correlation between velocity gradient orientation and the filament properties we analyzed. This result suggests that gravity is unlikely to be the dominant mechanism imposing order on the ∼0.05 pc scale for dense star-forming gas.

<title>The Star-forming Main Sequence in JADES and CEERS at z > 1.4: Investigating the Burstiness of Star Formation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have used public JWST/NIRSpec and JWST/NIRCam observations from the CEERS and JADES surveys in order to analyze the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) over the redshift range 1.4 ≤ z < 7. We calculate the star formation rates (SFRs) of the galaxy sample using three approaches: Balmer line luminosity, spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, and UV luminosity. We find a larger degree of scatter about the SFMS using the Balmer-based SFRs compared to the UV-based SFRs. Because these SFR indicators are sensitive to star formation on different timescales, the difference in scatter may be evidence of bursty star formation histories in the early Universe. We additionally compare the Hα-to-UV luminosity ratio (L(Hα)/νLν,1600) for individual galaxies in the sample and find that 29%–52% of the ratios across the sample are poorly described by predictions from a smooth star formation history. Measuring the burstiness of star formation in the early Universe has multiple significant implications, such as deriving accurate physical parameters from SED fitting, explaining the evolution of the UV luminosity function, and providing constraints for subgrid models of feedback in simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.

<title>Galaxy Spectroscopy without Spectra: Galaxy Properties from Photometric Images with Conditional Diffusion Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Modern spectroscopic surveys can only target a small fraction of the vast amount of photometrically cataloged sources in wide-field surveys. Here, we report the development of a generative artificial intelligence (AI) method capable of predicting optical galaxy spectra from photometric broadband images alone. This method draws from the latest advances in diffusion models in combination with contrastive networks. We pass multiband galaxy images into the architecture to obtain optical spectra. From these, robust values for galaxy properties can be derived with any methods in the spectroscopic toolbox, such as standard population synthesis techniques and Lick indices. When trained and tested on 64 × 64 pixel images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the global bimodality of star-forming and quiescent galaxies in photometric space is recovered, as well as a mass–metallicity relation of star-forming galaxies. The comparison between the observed and the artificially created spectra shows good agreement in overall metallicity, age, Dn4000, stellar velocity dispersion, and E(B − V) values. Photometric redshift estimates of our generative algorithm can compete with other current, specialized deep learning techniques. Moreover, this work is the first attempt in the literature to infer velocity dispersion from photometric images. Additionally, we can predict the presence of an active galactic nucleus up to an accuracy of 82%. With our method, scientifically interesting galaxy properties, normally requiring spectroscopic inputs, can be obtained in future data sets from large-scale photometric surveys alone. The spectra prediction via AI can further assist in creating realistic mock catalogs.

Infrared (IR) spectral features of interstellar and solar system ices have been attributed to solid organic and inorganic compounds for over 50 yr, but in many cases the laboratory IR data needed to fully quantify such work have never been published, forcing researchers to rely on assumptions about gas- or liquid-phase measurements to interpret data for ices. Here, we report the first mid-IR intensity measurements for isocyanic acid (HNCO) ices that are free of such assumptions, providing new results for use by both observational and laboratory astrochemists. We also report similar new IR data for both formaldehyde (H2CO) and formic acid (HCOOH), which have been discussed in the astrochemical literature for decades, but again without adequate laboratory data to help quantify observational results. Densities and refractive indices of HNCO, H2CO, and HCOOH as amorphous ices also are reported. Two applications of the new H2CO work are presented, the first vapor-pressure measurements of solid H2CO, along with an enthalpy of sublimation, at 100 to 109 K and a set of IR intensities of H2CO in H2O + H2CO ices. Band strengths, absorption coefficients, and optical constants are calculated for all three compounds. Extensive comparisons are made to older results, which are not recommended for future use.

<title>A Thorough Search for Short-timescale Periodicity in Four Active Repeating Fast Radio Bursts</title>

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright radio transients with millisecond durations, which typically occur at extragalactic distances. The association of FRB 20200428 with the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 strongly indicates that they could originate from neutron stars, which naturally leads to the expectation that periodicity connected with the spinning of magnetars should exist in the activities of repeating FRBs. However, previous studies have failed to find any signatures supporting such a conjecture. Here we perform a thorough search for short-timescale periodicity in the four most active repeating sources, i.e., FRBs 20121102A, 20200120E, 20201124A, and 20220912A. Three different methods are employed, including a phase folding algorithm, the H-test, and Lomb–Scargle periodograms. For the three most active repeaters from which more than 1000 bursts have been detected, i.e., FRBs 20121102A, 20201124A, and 20220912A, more in-depth period searches are conducted by considering various burst properties such as the pulse width, peak flux, fluence, and the brightness temperature. No clear periodicity is found in a period range of 0.001–1000 s in all efforts. Implications of such a null result on the theoretical models of FRBs are discussed.

<title>Intergalactic Medium Rotation Measure of Primordial Magnetic Fields</title>

The Faraday rotation effect, quantified by the rotation measure (RM), is a powerful probe of the large-scale magnetization of the Universe—tracing magnetic fields not only on galaxy and galaxy cluster scales but also in the intergalactic medium (IGM; referred to as RMIGM). The redshift dependence of the latter has extensively been explored with observations. It has also been shown that this relation can help to distinguish between different large-scale magnetization scenarios. We study the evolution of this RMIGM for different primordial magnetogenesis scenarios to search for the imprints of primordial magnetic fields (PMFs; magnetic fields originating in the early Universe) on the redshift-dependence of RMIGM. We use cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulations for evolving PMFs during large-scale structure formation, coupled with the light-cone analysis to produce a realistic statistical sample of mock RMIGM images. We study the predicted behavior for the cosmic evolution of RMIGM for different correlation lengths of PMFs, and provide fitting functions for their dependence on redshifts. We compare these mock RM trends with the recent analysis of the the LOw-Frequency ARray RM Grid and find that large-scale-correlated PMFs should have (comoving) strengths ≲0.75 nG, if they originated during inflation with the scale-invariant spectrum and (comoving) correlation length of ∼19 h−1 cMpc or ≲30 nG if they originated during phase-transition epochs with the comoving correlation length of ∼1 h−1 cMpc. Our findings agree with previous observations and confirm the results of semi-analytical studies, showing that upper limits on the PMF strength decrease as their coherence scales increase.

<title>Dynamic 3D Simulation of Surface Charging on Rotating Asteroids</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The surface-charging phenomenon of asteroids, mainly resulting from solar wind plasma and solar radiation, has been extensively studied. However, the influence of the asteroid’s rotation on surface charging is not yet fully understood. In this study, a neural network is established to replace numerical integration, improving the efficiency of dynamic 3D simulations. We simulate rotating asteroids and their surrounding plasma environments under various conditions, including the quiet solar wind and solar storms. Different minerals on the asteroid surface are also considered. Additionally, the effects of orbital motion and obliquity are studied for asteroids with rotation periods comparable to their orbital periods. The results show that under the typical solar wind, the maximum and minimum potentials of asteroids gradually decrease with increasing rotation periods, especially when the solar wind is obliquely incident. For asteroids with rotation periods longer than one week, this decreasing trend becomes extremely slow. During a solar storm, the solar wind plasma changes sharply, and the susceptibility of an asteroid’s surface potential to rotation is greatly pronounced. Surface minerals also play a role; plagioclase is the most sensitive mineral among those explored, while ilmenite appears indifferent to changes in rotation periods. Understanding the surface charging of asteroids under various rotation periods and angles is crucial for further research on solar wind plasma and asteroids’ surface dust motion, providing a reference for the safe landing and exploration of asteroids.

<title>Multiple Components of the Outflow in the Protostellar System HH 212: Outer Outflow Shell, Rotating Wind, Shocked Wind, and Jet</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8eb4</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 7 observations of the CO (J = 3−2) line emission of the protostellar system HH 212 at ∼24 au spatial resolution and compare them to those of the SiO (J = 8−7) and SO (J = 8−7) line emission reported in the literature. We find that the CO line traces four distinct regions: (1) an outer outflow shell, (2) a rotating wind region between the SiO and CO shells, (3) the shocked and wide-angle inner X-wind inside a SiO shell, and (4) the jet. The origin of the CO outer outflow shell could be associated with the entrained material of the envelope, or an extended disk wind. The rotating wind, which is shocked, is launched from a radius of 9–15 au, slightly exterior to that of the previously detected SO shell, which marks the boundary where the wide-angle X-wind is interacting with and shocking the disk wind. Additionally, the SO is found to be mixed with the CO emission within the thick and extended rotating wind region. The large-scale CO-shocked wind coexists with the SO emission near the upper portion of the inner shocked region converged on top of the inner SiO knots. The CO jet is traced by a chain of knots with roughly equal intervals, exhibiting quasiperiodicity, as reported in other jets in the literature.

<title>Mergers, Radio Jets, and Quenching Star Formation in Massive Galaxies: Quantifying Their Synchronized Cosmic Evolution and Assessing the Energetics</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8f3e</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The existence of a population of massive quiescent galaxies with little to no star formation poses a challenge to our understanding of galaxy evolution. The physical process that quenched the star formation in these galaxies is debated, but the most popular possibility is that feedback from supermassive black holes lifts or heats the gas that would otherwise be used to form stars. In this paper, we evaluate this idea in two ways. First, we compare the cumulative growth in the cosmic inventory of the total stellar mass in quiescent galaxies to the corresponding growth in the amount of kinetic energy carried by radio jets. We find that these two inventories are remarkably well-synchronized, with about 50% of the total amounts being created in the epoch from z ≈ 1 to 2. We also show that these agree extremely well with the corresponding growth in the cumulative number of major mergers that result in massive (>1011Mʘ) galaxies. We therefore argue that major mergers trigger the radio jets and also transform the galaxies from disks to spheroids. Second, we evaluate the total amount of kinetic energy delivered by jets and compare it to the baryonic binding energy of the galaxies. We find the jet kinetic energy is more than sufficient to quench star formation, and the quenching process should be more effective in more massive galaxies. We show that these results are quantitatively consistent with recent measurements of the Sunyaev–Zel’dovich effect seen in massive galaxies at z ≈ 1.

<title>Detailed Calculations of the Efficiency of Planetesimal Accretion in the Core-accretion Model. III. The Contribution of Planetesimals beyond Saturn</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Continuing our initiative on advancing the calculations of planetesimal accretion in the core-accretion model, we present here the results of our recent study of the contributions of planetesimals around and beyond the orbit of Saturn. In our first two papers, where our focus was on the effects of the Sun and Saturn, the initial distribution of planetesimals was limited to the regions around the accretion zone of a growing Jupiter. In this paper, we expanded that distribution to regions beyond the accretion zone of Saturn. We integrated the orbits of a large ensemble of planetesimals and studied the rate of their capture by the growing proto-Jupiter. In order to be consistent with our previous studies, we did not consider the effect of the nebular gas. Results demonstrated that the exterior planetesimals, especially those beyond 8 au, have only slight contributions to the growth and metallicity of the growing Jupiter. The final mass and composition of this planet is mainly due to the planetesimals inside and around its accretion zone. Our study shows that although the rate of capture varies slightly by the size and composition of planetesimals, in general, the final results are independent of the size and material of these bodies. Results also pointed to a new finding: the rate of accretion follows the same trend as that of the evolution of Jupiter’s envelope, with the largest accretion occurring during the envelope’s collapse. We present details of our analysis and discuss the implications of its results.

<title>Challenges for Fast Radio Bursts as Multimessenger Sources from Binary Neutron Star Mergers</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9023</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration transients from extragalactic sources, with their origins remaining a topic of active debate. Among the proposed progenitors, binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are compelling candidates for some nonrepeating FRBs. However, associating FRBs with BNS mergers cannot be based solely on low chance coincidence probability. This study delineates necessary criteria for associating FRBs with BNS mergers, focusing on the postmerger ejecta environment. To underscore the significance of these criteria, we scrutinise the proposed association between GW190425 and FRB 20190425A, considering the requirement for the FRB signal to traverse the dense merger ejecta without significant attenuation to remain detectable at 400 MHz. Our investigation reveals that if the FRB is linked to the gravitational-wave (GW) event, the GW data support a highly off-axis configuration, with a probability of the BNS merger viewing angle p(θv > 30°) being ≈99.99%. This strongly excludes an on-axis system, which is required for this FRB to be detectable. We also find faraway FRB emission models inadequate to explain the FRB 20190425A–GW190425 connection. Thus, we conclude that GW190425 is not related to FRB 20190425A. We discuss the implications for future multimessenger observations, suggesting that BNS merger remnants are unlikely to account for more than 1% of FRB sources. This finding implies that short gamma-ray bursts, which are expected to occur in only a fraction of all BNS mergers, cannot account for the overall characteristics of the FRB host population.

<title>Exploring Magnetic Fields in a Merging Galaxy: Comparing Polarization and Velocity Gradient in the Centaurus Galaxy</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad93a3</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this study, we apply the velocity gradient technique to the merging Centaurus galaxy. We compare gradient maps derived from the PHANGS-Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array survey using CO emission lines with magnetic field tracings from dust polarization data obtained via the HAWC+ instrument. Our analysis reveals a strong correspondence between the directions indicated by these two tracers across most of the galactic image. Specifically, we identify jet regions as areas of antialignment, consistent with previous reports that gradients tend to rotate 90° in outflow regions. Statistically, we find that the alignment of magnetic fields, as revealed by polarization, is most accurate in regions with the highest signal-to-noise ratios. Our findings underscore the utility of velocity gradients as a valuable complementary tool for probing magnetic fields and dynamical processes in merging galaxies. This proves the general utility of velocity gradients for mapping magnetic fields in astrophysical objects with complex dynamics.

<title>Dark Matter Halos of Luminous Active Galactic Nuclei from Galaxy–Galaxy Lensing with the HSC Subaru Strategic Program</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad86b5</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We assess the dark matter halo masses of luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs) over the redshift range 0.2–1.2 using galaxy–galaxy lensing based on imaging data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). We measure the weak lensing signal of a sample of 48,907 AGNs constructed using HSC and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer photometry. As expected, we find that the lensing mass profile of total AGN sample is consistent with that of massive galaxies ( 10.61). Surprisingly, the lensing signal remains unchanged when the AGN sample is split into four host galaxy stellar mass bins. Specifically, we find that the excess surface density of AGNs residing in galaxies with high stellar masses significantly differs from that of the control sample. We further fit a halo occupation distribution model to the data to infer the posterior distribution of parameters including the average halo mass. We find that the characteristic halo mass of the full AGN population lies near the knee ( ) of the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR). Illustrative of the results given above, the halo masses of AGNs residing in host galaxies with high stellar masses (i.e., above the knee of the SHMR) fall below the calibrated SHMR while the halo masses of the low stellar mass sample are more consistent with the established SHMR. These results indicate that massive halos with a higher clustering bias tend to suppress AGN activity, probably due to the lack of available gas.

<title>ODIN: Identifying Protoclusters and Cosmic Filaments Traced by Lyα-emitting Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To understand the formation and evolution of massive cosmic structures, studying them at high redshift, in the epoch when they formed the majority of their mass, is essential. The One-hundred-deg2 DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey is undertaking the widest-area narrowband program to date, to use Lyα-emitting galaxies (LAEs) to trace the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe on the scale of 10–100 cMpc at three cosmic epochs. In this work, we present results at z = 3.1 based on early ODIN data in the COSMOS field. We identify protoclusters and cosmic filaments using multiple methods and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. We then compare our observations against the IllustrisTNG suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The two are in excellent agreement, identifying a similar number and angular size of structures above a specified density threshold. We successfully recover the simulated protoclusters with log(Mz=0/M⊙) ≳ 14.4 in ∼60% of the cases. With these objects, we show that the descendant masses of our observed protoclusters can be estimated purely based on our 2D measurements, finding a median z = 0 mass of ∼1014.5M⊙. The lack of information on the radial extent of each protocluster introduces a ∼0.4 dex uncertainty in its descendant mass. Finally, we show that the recovery of the cosmic web in the vicinity of protoclusters is both efficient and accurate. The similarity of our observations and the simulations implies that our structure selection is likewise robust and efficient, demonstrating that LAEs are reliable tracers of the LSS.

<title>Constraining the Circumstellar Medium Structure and Progenitor Mass-loss History of Interacting Supernovae Through 3D Hydrodynamic Modeling: The Case of SN 2014C</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8ac8</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8ac8</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate SN 2014C using three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic modeling, focusing on its early interaction with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). Our objective is to uncover the pre-supernova (SN) CSM structure and constrain the progenitor star’s mass-loss history prior to core collapse. Our comprehensive model traces the evolution from the progenitor star through the SN event and into the SN remnant phase. We simulate the remnant’s expansion over approximately 15 yr, incorporating a CSM derived from the progenitor star’s outflows through dedicated hydrodynamic simulations. Analysis reveals that the remnant interacted with a dense toroidal nebula extending from 4.3 × 1016 to 1.5 × 1017 cm in the equatorial plane, with a thickness of approximately 1.2 × 1017 cm. The nebula’s density peaks at approximately 3 × 106 cm−3 at the inner boundary, gradually decreasing as ≈r−2 at greater distances. This nebula formed due to intense mass loss from the progenitor star between approximately 5000 and 1000 yr before collapse. During this period, the maximum mass-loss rate reached about 8 × 10−4M⊙ yr−1, ejecting ≈2.5 M⊙ of stellar material into the CSM. Our model accurately reproduces Chandra and NuSTAR spectra, including the iron (Fe) K line, throughout the remnant’s evolution. Notably, the Fe line is self-consistently reproduced, originating from shocked ejecta, with ≈0.05 M⊙ of pure-Fe ejecta shocked during the remnant–nebula interaction. These findings suggest that the 3D geometry and density distribution of the CSM, as well as the progenitor star’s mass-loss history, align with a scenario where the star was stripped through binary interaction, specifically common-envelope evolution.

<title>Exploring Lenticular Galaxy Formation in Field Environments Using NewHorizon: Evidence for Counterrotating Gas Accretion as a Formation Channel</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The formation pathways of lenticular galaxies (S0s) in field environments remain a matter of debate. We utilize the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, NewHorizon, to investigate the issue. We select two massive star formation quenched S0s as our main sample. By closely tracing their physical and morphological evolution, we identify two primary formation channels: mergers and counterrotating gas accretion. The former induces central gas inflow due to gravitational and hydrodynamic torques, triggering active central star formation, which quickly depletes the gas of the galaxy. Counterrotating gas accretion overall has a similar outcome but more exclusively through hydrodynamic collisions between the preexisting and newly accreted gas. Both channels lead to S0 morphology, with gas angular momentum cancellation being a crucial mechanism. These formation pathways quench star formation on a short timescale (<Gyr) compared to the timescales of environmental effects. We also discuss how counterrotating gas accretion may explain the origin of S0s with ongoing star formation and the frequently observed gas–star misaligned kinematics in S0s.

<title>Halfway to the Peak: The JWST MIRI 5.6 μm Number Counts and Source Population</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8c22</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8c22</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present an analysis of eight JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) 5.6 μm images with 5σ depths of ≈0.1 μJy. We detect 2854 sources within our combined area of 18.4 arcmin2. We compute the MIRI 5.6 μm number counts, including an analysis of the field-to-field variation. Compared to earlier published MIRI 5.6 μm counts, our counts have a more pronounced knee, at roughly 2 μJy. The location and amplitude of the counts at the knee are consistent with the Cowley et al. model predictions, although these models tend to overpredict the counts below the knee. In areas of overlap, 84% of the MIRI sources have a counterpart in the COSMOS2020 catalog. These MIRI sources have redshifts that are mostly in the z ∼ 0.5–2, with a tail out to z ∼ 5. They are predominantly moderate to low stellar masses (108–1010M⊙) main-sequence star-forming galaxies, suggesting that with ≈2 hr exposures, MIRI can reach well below M* at cosmic noon and reach higher mass systems out to z ∼ 5. Nearly 70% of the COSMOS2020 sources in areas of overlap now have a data point at 5.6 μm (rest-frame near-IR at cosmic noon), which allows for more accurate stellar population parameter estimates. Finally, we discovered 31 MIRI-bright sources not present in COSMOS2020. A crossmatch with IRAC channel 1 suggests that 10%–20% of these are likely lower mass (M* ≈ 109M⊙), z ∼ 1 dusty galaxies. The rest (80%–90%) are consistent with more massive but still very dusty galaxies at z > 3.

<title>Exploring Pulsar Timing Precision: A Comparative Study of Polarization Calibration Methods for NANOGrav Data from the Green Bank Telescope</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Pulsar timing array experiments have recently uncovered evidence for a nanohertz gravitational wave background by precisely timing an ensemble of millisecond pulsars. The next significant milestones for these experiments include characterizing the detected background with greater precision, identifying its source(s), and detecting continuous gravitational waves from individual supermassive black hole binaries. To achieve these objectives, generating accurate and precise times of arrival of pulses from pulsar observations is crucial. Incorrect polarization calibration of the observed pulsar profiles may introduce errors in the measured times of arrival. Further, previous studies have demonstrated that robust polarization calibration of pulsar profiles can reduce noise in the pulsar timing data and improve timing solutions. In this paper, we investigate and compare the impact of different polarization calibration methods on pulsar timing precision using three distinct calibration techniques: the Ideal Feed Assumption (IFA), Measurement Equation Modeling (MEM), and Measurement Equation Template Matching (METM). Three NANOGrav pulsars—PSRs J1643−1224, J1744−1134, and J1909−3744—observed with the 800 MHz and 1.5 GHz receivers at the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) are utilized for our analysis. Our findings reveal that all three calibration methods enhance timing precision compared to scenarios where no polarization calibration is performed. Additionally, among the three calibration methods, the IFA approach generally provides the best results for timing analysis of pulsars observed with the GBT receiver system. We attribute the comparatively poorer performance of the MEM and METM methods to potential instabilities in the reference noise diode coupled to the receiver and temporal variations in the profile of the reference pulsar, respectively.

<title>A Rapidly Accreting Active Galactic Nucleus Hidden in a Dust-obscured Galaxy at z ∼ 0.8</title>

Dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) containing central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that are rapidly accreting (i.e., having high Eddington ratios, λEdd) may represent a key phase closest to the peak of both the black hole and galaxy growth in the coevolution framework for SMBHs and galaxies. In this work, we present a 68 ks XMM-Newton observation of the high-λEdd DOG J1324+4501 at z ∼ 0.8, which was initially observed by Chandra. We analyze the XMM-Newton spectra jointly with archival Chandra spectra. In performing a detailed X-ray spectral analysis, we find that the source is intrinsically X-ray luminous with /erg and heavily obscured with . We further utilize UV-to-IR archival photometry to measure and fit the source’s spectral energy distribution to estimate its host-galaxy properties. We present a supplementary comparison sample of 21 X-ray luminous DOGs from the XMM-SERVS survey with sufficient (>200) 0.5–10 keV counts to perform a similarly detailed X-ray spectral analysis. Of the X-ray luminous DOGs in our sample, we find that J1324+4501 is the most remarkable, possessing one of the highest X-ray luminosities, column densities, and star formation rates. We demonstrate that J1324+4501 is in an extreme evolutionary stage where SMBH accretion and galaxy growth are at their peaks.

We present the first comprehensive census of the satellite population around a Large Magellanic Cloud stellar-mass galaxy, as part of the Magellanic Analog Dwarf Companions and Stellar Halos (MADCASH) survey. We have surveyed NGC 2403 (D = 3.0 Mpc) with the Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam imager out to a projected radius of 90 kpc (with partial coverage extending out to ∼110 kpc, or ∼80% of the virial radius of NGC 2403), resolving stars in the uppermost ∼2.5 mag of its red giant branch. By looking for stellar overdensities in the red giant branch spatial density map, we identify 149 satellite candidates, of which only the previously discovered MADCASH J074238+65201-dw is a bona fide dwarf, together with the more massive and disrupting satellite DDO 44. We carefully assess the completeness of our search via injection of artificial dwarf galaxies into the images, finding that we are reliably sensitive to candidates down to MV ∼ −7.5 mag (and somewhat sensitive to even fainter satellites). A comparison of the satellite luminosity function of NGC 2403 down to this magnitude limit to theoretical expectations shows overall good agreement. This is the first of a full sample of 11 Magellanic Cloud–mass host galaxies we will analyze, creating a statistical sample that will provide the first quantitative constraints on hierarchical models of galaxy formation around low-mass hosts.

<title>Insights into the Long-term Flaring Events of Blazar PKS 0805-07: A Multiwavelength Analysis Over the Period of 2009–2023</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8ddb</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We conducted a comprehensive temporal and spectral study of the FSRQ PKS 0805-07 by using broadband observations from the Fermi-LAT and Swift-XRT/UVOT instruments over the period of MJD 54684-60264. The 3 day binned γ-ray light curve during the active state revealed 11 distinct peak structures with the maximum integral flux (E > 100 MeV) reached (1.56 ± 0.16) × 10−6 photons cm−2 s−1 on MJD 59904.5. The shortest observed γ-ray variability was 2.80 ± 0.77 days. A correlation analysis between the γ-ray spectral index and flux indicated the typical trend of hardening when the source is brighter, commonly observed in blazars. We identified a lag of 121 (+27.21, −3.51) days in the spectral index relative to the flux, within the time interval MJD 59582 to 60112. The Anderson–Darling test and histogram fit rejected the normality of the γ-ray flux distribution and instead suggested a log-normal distribution. To gain insight into the underlying physical processes, we extracted broadband spectra from different time periods in the light curve. The spectral energy distribution during various flux states was well-reproduced using synchrotron, synchrotron-self-Compton, and external-Compton emissions from a broken power-law electron distribution. The seed photons required for the external Compton process are from the IR region. A comparison of the best-fit physical parameters indicated that the variations in different flux states were primarily associated with an increase in the bulk Lorentz factor and magnetic field from low to high flux states.

<title>Differential Rotation of Individual Sunspots and Pores</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90a0</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The analysis of the rotation rate of individual sunspots and pores was performed according to the data from the processing of observations by the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager in the period 2010–2024. Sunspots stood out in the images in the continuum. To accurately track the spots, we processed five images for each day. To determine the polarity of the magnetic field, we superimposed the contours of sunspots on observations of magnetic fields at the same time. This made it possible to track the movement of more than 210,000 individual sunspots and pores. It is found that the rotation rate is influenced by the rotation rate of the solar atmosphere and the systematic proper motions of the spots. Sunspots and pores of the leading polarity have a rate of meridional movement ≈2.4% faster than spots of the trailing polarity. We also found that regular sunspots, which have umbrae and penumbrae, rotate ≈1.5% faster than solar pores, in which penumbrae are absent. The dependence of the rotation rate on the area is found. For sunspots with an area of S > 10 μhm, the rotation rate is practically independent of the area. Small sunspots, with an area of S < 10 μhm, rotate ≈1.7% more slowly.

<title>Observations of the Crustal Mini-magnetopause Reconnection at Mars</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Magnetopause reconnection is a fundamental mechanism for mass and energy transfer in terrestrial planetary systems. Unlike Earth, Mars lacks a global magnetic field and instead has localized crustal magnetic fields, which can create structures morphologically similar to a scaled-down intrinsic magnetosphere, potentially forming mini-magnetospheres. In this study, we investigate reconnection in Martian mini-magnetospheres on the dayside, analyzing key characteristics of the reconnecting current sheet, and the associated ion escape rate, and comparing these features to reconnection events at the induced magnetopause documented in previous studies. Our observations reveal that, in the subsolar region, the thickness of the Martian mini-magnetopause is comparable to the upstream proton inertial length and the convective gyroradius of the magnetosheath solar wind. However, at higher solar zenith angles, this thickness increases to several times these characteristic lengths. Reconnection-driven ion escape rates at the induced magnetopause are at least 1 order of magnitude greater than those associated with mini-magnetopause reconnection. These findings provide new insights into reconnection processes at Martian boundary layers.

<title>Implementation of Aerosol Mie Scattering in POSEIDON with Application to the Hot Jupiter HD 189733 b’s Transmission, Emission, and Reflected Light Spectrum</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Aerosols are a ubiquitous feature of planetary atmospheres and leave clear spectral imprints in exoplanet spectra. Pre-JWST, exoplanet retrieval frameworks mostly adopted simple parametric approximations. With JWST, we now have access to mid-infrared wavelengths where aerosols have detectable composition-specific resonance features. Here, we implement new features into the open-source atmospheric retrieval code POSEIDON to account for the complex scattering, reflection, and absorption properties of Mie-scattering aerosols. We provide an open-source database of these Mie-scattering cross sections and optical properties. We also extend the radiative transfer and retrieval functionality in POSEIDON to include multiple scattering reflection and emission spectroscopy. We demonstrate these new retrieval capabilities on archival Hubble and Spitzer transmission and secondary-eclipse spectra of the hot Jupiter HD 189733 b. We find that a high-altitude, low-density, and thin slab composed of submicron particles is necessary to fit HD 189733 b’s transmission spectrum, with multiple aerosol species providing a good fit. We additionally retrieve a subsolar H2O abundance, a subsolar K abundance, and do not detect CO2. Our joint thermal and reflection retrievals of HD 189733 b’s secondary-eclipse spectrum, however, finds no evidence of dayside aerosols, a subsolar dayside H2O abundance, enhanced CO2, or slightly subsolar alkali abundances. We additionally explore how retrieval model choices such as cloud parameterization, aerosol species and properties, and thermal structure parameterization affect retrieved atmospheric properties. Upcoming JWST data for hot Jupiters such as HD 189733 b will be well suited to enable deeper exploration of aerosol properties, allowing the formulation of a self-consistent, multidimensional picture of cloud formation processes.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We use mid-infrared variability in galaxies to search for active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the local universe. We use a sample of 10,220 galaxies from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory survey, part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. For each galaxy, we examine its mid-infrared variability in the W2 [4.6 μm] band over 13 years using data from the Wide Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) All-Sky and Near Earth Objects WISE missions. We demonstrate that we can detect variability signatures as small as about 7% in the rms variation of W2 flux for the majority of cases. Using other AGN signatures of the variable galaxies, such as optical narrow lines, optical broad lines, and WISE W1 − W2 colors, we show that ∼75% of the variables show these additional AGN signatures, indicating that the bulk of these cases are likely to be AGN. We also identify seven galaxies that have light curves characteristic of tidal disruption events. We present here a publicly available catalog of the light-curve variability in W2 of these galaxies.

<title>Confirming the Tidal Tails of the Young Open Cluster Blanco 1 with TESS Rotation Periods</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad89a7</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Blanco 1 is an ≈130 Myr open cluster located 240 pc from the Sun, below the Galactic plane. Recent studies have reported the existence of diffuse tidal tails extending 50–60 pc from the cluster center based on the positions and velocities measured by Gaia. To independently assess the reality and extent of this structure, we used light curves generated from TESS full-frame images to search for photometric rotation periods of stars in and around Blanco 1. We detected rotation periods down to a stellar effective temperature of ≈3100 K in 347 of the 603 cluster member candidates for which we have light curves. For cluster members in the core and candidate members in the tidal tails, both within a temperature range of 4400–6200 K, 74% and 72% of the rotation periods, respectively, are consistent with the single-star gyrochronological sequence. In contrast, a comparison sample of field stars yielded gyrochrone-consistent rotation periods for only 8.5% of the stars. The tidal tail candidates’ overall conformance to the core members’ gyrochrone sequence implies that their contamination ratio is consistent with zero and <0.33 at the 2σ level. This result confirms the existence of Blanco 1 tidal tails and doubles the number of Blanco 1 members for which there are both spatio-kinematic and rotation-based cluster membership verification. Extending the strategy of using TESS light curves for gyrochronology to other nearby young open clusters and stellar associations may provide a viable strategy for mapping out their dissolution and broadening the search for young exoplanets.

<title>Universal Nonthermal Power-law Distribution Functions from the Self-consistent Evolution of Collisionless Electrostatic Plasmas</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad91a1</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad91a1</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Collisionless systems often exhibit nonthermal power-law tails in their distribution functions. Interestingly, collisionless plasmas in various physical scenarios (e.g., the ion population of the solar wind) feature a v−5 tail in their velocity (v) distribution, whose origin has been a long-standing puzzle. We show this power-law tail to be a natural outcome of the collisionless relaxation of driven electrostatic plasmas. Using a quasi-linear analysis of the perturbed Vlasov–Poisson equations, we show that the coarse-grained mean distribution function (DF), f0, follows a quasi-linear diffusion equation with a diffusion coefficient D(v) that depends on v through the plasma dielectric constant. If the plasma is isotropically forced on scales larger than the Debye length with a white-noise-like electric field, D(v) ∼ v4 for σ < v < ωP/k, with σ the thermal velocity, ωP the plasma frequency, and k the characteristic wavenumber of the perturbation; the corresponding quasi-steady-state f0 develops a v−(d + 2) tail in d dimensions (v−5 tail in 3D), while the energy (E) distribution develops an E−2 tail independent of dimensionality. Any redness of the noise only alters the scaling in the high v end. Nonresonant particles moving slower than the phase velocity of the plasma waves (ωP/k) experience a Debye-screened electric field, and significantly less (power-law suppressed) acceleration than the near-resonant particles. Thus, a Maxwellian DF develops a power-law tail, while its core (v < σ) eventually also heats up but over a much longer timescale. We definitively show that self-consistency (ignored in test-particle treatments) is crucial for the emergence of the universal v−5 tail.

<title>Kink Instability of Flux Ropes in Partially Ionized Plasmas</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In the solar atmosphere, flux ropes are subject to current-driven instabilities that are crucial in driving plasma eruptions, ejections, and heating. A typical ideal magnetohydrodynamics instability developing in flux ropes is the helical kink, which twists the flux rope axis. The growth of this instability can trigger magnetic reconnection, which can explain the formation of chromospheric jets and spicules, but its development has never been investigated in a partially ionized plasma (PIP). Here, we study the kink instability in PIP to understand how it develops in the solar chromosphere, where it is affected by charge-neutral interactions. Partial ionization speeds up the onset of the nonlinear phase of the instability, as the plasma β of the isolated plasma is smaller than the total plasma β of the bulk. The distribution of the released magnetic energy changes in fully ionized plasma and PIP, with a larger increase in internal energy associated with the PIP cases. The temperature in PIP increases faster also due to heating terms from the two-fluid dynamics. PIP effects trigger kink instability on shorter time scales, which is reflected in more explosive chromospheric flux rope dynamics. These results are crucial to understanding the dynamics of small-scale chromospheric structures—minifilament eruptions—that thus far have been largely neglected but could significantly contribute to chromospheric heating and jet formation.

<title>The Lyα Dependence on Nebular Properties from the HETDEX and MOSDEF Surveys</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Investigating the impact of galaxy properties on emergent Lyα emission is crucial for reionization studies, given the sensitivity of Lyα to neutral hydrogen. This study presents an analysis of the physical characteristics of 155 star-forming galaxies, 29 with Lyα detected, and 126 with Lyα not detected with Lyα EW < 20 Å, at z = 1.9–3.5, drawn from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field survey, that have overlapping observations from the Hobby–Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment survey. To unravel the interstellar medium (ISM) conditions in our sample, we developed a custom nebular line modeling algorithm based on the MAPPINGS V photoionization model grid and the emcee framework. Combining nebular-based ISM properties with photometry-based global properties, constrained via Bagpipes, we explore distinctions in the stellar and gas properties between Lyα-detected and Lyα-nondetected galaxies. Our analysis reveals statistically significant differences between the two samples in terms of stellar mass and dust attenuation (AV) at >2σ significance, as determined via a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Moreover, there are weaker (≲1σ significance) indications that the ionization parameter and metallicity differ between the two samples. Our results demonstrate that the escape fraction of Lyα ( ) is inversely correlated with stellar mass, star formation rate, and dust attenuation, while it is positively correlated with the ionization parameter, with significance levels exceeding 2σ. Our findings suggest that the interstellar environments of Lyα-detected galaxies, characterized by low mass, low dust, low gas-phase metallicity, and high ionization parameters, play a pivotal role in promoting the escape of Lyα radiation.

<title>MHD Modeling of a Geoeffective Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection with the Magnetic Topology Informed by In Situ Observations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Variations of the magnetic field within a solar coronal mass ejection (CME) in the heliosphere depend on the CME’s magnetic structure as it leaves the solar corona and its interplanetary evolution. To account for this evolution, we developed a new numerical model of the inner heliosphere that simulates the propagation of a CME through a realistic solar wind background and allows various CME magnetic topologies. To this end, we incorporate the Gibson–Low CME model within our global MHD model of the inner heliosphere, GAMERA-Helio. We apply the model to study the propagation of the geoeffective CME that erupted on 2010 April 3, aiming to reproduce the temporal variations of the magnetic field vector during the CME’s passage by Earth. Parameters of the Gibson–Low CME are informed by STEREO white-light observations near the Sun. The magnetic topology for this CME—the tethered flux rope—is informed by in situ magnetic field observations near Earth. We performed two simulations testing different CME propagation directions. For an in-ecliptic direction, the simulation shows a rotation of all three magnetic field components within the CME, as seen at Earth, similar to that observed. However, the magnitudes of the components, particularly at the back of the CME, are underestimated by the model. With a southward direction, suggested by coronal imaging observations, the Bx component lacks the observed change from negative to positive. In both cases, the model favors the east–west orientation of the flux rope, consistent with the orientation previously inferred from the images from STEREO/Heliospheric Imager.

<title>CLASSY. XI. Tracing Neutral Gas Properties Using UV Absorption Lines and 21 cm Observations*</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Rest-frame far-ultraviolet (FUV) observations from JWST are revolutionizing our understanding of the high-z galaxies that drove reionization and the mechanisms by which they accomplished it. To fully interpret these observations, we must be able to diagnose how properties of the interstellar medium (ISM; e.g., column density, covering fraction, and outflow velocity) directly relate to the absorption features produced. Using the high-signal-to-noise and high-resolution FUV spectra of 45 nearby star-forming galaxies from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph Legacy Spectroscopic Survey, we present the largest uniform, simultaneous characterization of neutral and low-ionization state (LIS) interstellar UV absorption lines (O i, Si ii, S ii, C ii, and Al ii) across a wide range of galaxy properties. We also present 21 cm H i observations for 35 galaxies, multiple of which are gas-poor or nondetected, possibly indicating the onset of a post-starburst phase. We find that our simultaneous one-component Voigt profile fits are capable of accurately modeling the LIS absorption for ∼75% of galaxies, mitigating challenges associated with saturation, infilling, and degeneracies. While the most massive galaxies require additional components, our one-component fits return average properties of the absorbing gas and follow the scaling relations described by a single gas cloud. We explore connections between LIS absorption and direct tracers of the neutral ISM (O i, Lyα, and H i 21 cm), finding that C ii most closely traces the neutral gas trends, while other ions exhibit weaker correlations. Given the challenges with directly observing H i at higher-z, we demonstrate that LIS absorption can be a powerful means to study the neutral ISM and present empirical relationships for predicting neutral gas properties.

<title>NNHMC: An Efficient Stokes Inversion Method Using a Neural Network (NN) Model Combined with the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) Algorithm</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Milne–Eddington (M-E) atmosphere model is commonly adopted in the inversion of the magnetic fields in the solar photosphere. By applying the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm or training a neural network (NN) model, the magnetic field vector can be quickly inferred from the Stokes profile but lacks reliable and statistically well-defined confidence intervals for parameters. To address this, we present an efficient Bayesian inference method called NNHMC, combining the NN model with the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm. The NN model is used to speedily synthesize batches of synthetic Stokes profiles, accelerating the inference process. The HMC algorithm significantly improves sampling efficiency in high-dimensional parameter spaces and can handle large-scale data sets in batches. The spectropolarimetric observation of an active region obtained by the Hinode/spectropolarimeter (SP) is used to demonstrate the capability of the NNHMC method. The strength, inclination, and azimuth of the magnetic field and the line-of-sight velocity inferred with the NNHMC method are very similar to those derived with the MERLIN code. Furthermore, this study provided posterior distributions and uncertainties for these parameters. A test on the same hardware and software platform shows a speed increase of up to 2.5 orders of magnitude with respect to the traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (without the NN, using the M-E atmosphere model), establishing the NNHMC method as a highly effective tool for Stokes inversion based on Bayesian inference.

<title>Electrostatic Solitary Waves in Electronegative Martian Plasma</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b49</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The solar wind interacts with planetary magnetospheres, generating plasma waves in both the upstream region and the magnetospheric environment. Mars, lacking an inherent magnetic field, has an induced magnetosphere formed through solar wind interaction with its ionosphere. These waves are crucial for momentum and energy exchange within the planetary plasma environment. This study focuses on the existence and dynamics of electrostatic solitary waves (ESWs) in Martian ionospheric plasma, characterized by various flowing ions. We employ a multifluid plasma model incorporating positive (streaming) ions, negative ions, and two distinct kappa-distributed electron populations to study ESW propagation in the Martian ionosphere from first principles. Linear analysis reveals four distinct modes, including a subsonic mode due to the negative-ion beam. Electrostatic waves may become unstable due to a beam instability excited at long wavelengths. Seeking stationary profile solutions, an energy balance equation is obtained in the moving reference frame, and the shape of the solitary wave can thus be predicted numerically. A meticulous analysis reveals that either positive- or negative-polarity ESWs (or both) may occur (simultaneously) in the Martian environment. In addition to conventional bipolar E-field waveforms, our theoretical model predicts the existence of wiggly bipolar pulses (supersolitary waves) and offset bipolar pulses (flat-top solitary waves) in Martian plasma. Comparison of our model’s predictions with real observational plasma parameters indicates that, like Martian magnetosheath plasma, ionospheric plasma may sustain ESWs measuring several tens of millivolts per meter.

<title>Magnetohydrodynamic Instabilities of Double Magnetic Bands in a Shallow-water Tachocline Model. II. Teleconnection Between High- and Low-latitude Bands and Across Equator</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b50</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The “extended solar cycle” indicates that there are two deeply seated toroidal magnetic field bands in each hemisphere. Both bands migrate equatorward as a sunspot cycle progresses. Here, we examine the consequences of global MHD instability of this migrating double-band system in tachocline on the latitudinal structure of unstable modes, which are essentially MHD Rossby waves. We find that latitude-location, latitude-separation, and the amplitude of the bands strongly influence the latitudinal structure and growth rates of the unstable modes of both symmetries about the equator. These properties can lead to “teleconnections” between low- and high-latitudes in each hemisphere and across the equator. High-latitude bands can destabilize low-latitude bands that would otherwise be stable. Stronger high-latitude bands lead to strong interactions between low and high latitude in each hemisphere, but inhibit cross-equatorial band-interaction. Strong cross-equatorial interactions of modes can synchronize cycle minima in north and south. Symmetric and antisymmetric modes of similar amplitudes can lead to substantial asymmetries between north and south. As a solar cycle progresses, excited MHD Rossby waves go through a sequence of changes in latitude structure and growth rate, while maintaining strong links in latitude. These changes and links are theoretical evidence of teleconnections between widely separated latitudes and longitudes in the Sun, which may explain many of the evolving surface magnetic patterns observed as a solar cycle progresses. The wider the separation between high- and low-latitude bands, the earlier the cross-equatorial teleconnection starts in a cycle, and hence the earlier the cycle starts declining.

<title>NEOWISE-R Caught the Luminous SN 2023ixf in Messier 101</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
During routine survey imaging, the reactivated Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE-R) serendipitously caught the Type II supernova SN 2023ixf in Messier 101 on the rise, starting day 3.6 through day 10.9, and again on the decline at late times from days 211 through 213 and days 370 through 372. We have considered these mid-IR data together with observations from the ultraviolet (UV) through the near-IR, when possible. At day 3.6 we approximated the optical emission with a hot, ∼26,630 K blackbody, with a notable UV excess inferred to result from strong supernova (SN) shock interaction with circumstellar matter (CSM). In the IR, however, a clear excess is also obvious, and we fit it with a cooler, ∼1620 K blackbody with a radius of ∼2.6 × 1015 cm, consistent with dust in the progenitor’s circumstellar shell likely heated by the UV emission from the CSM interaction. On day 10.8, the light detected was consistent with SN ejecta-dominated emission. At late times we also observed a clear NEOWISE-R excess, which could arise either from newly formed dust in the inner ejecta or in the contact discontinuity between the forward and reverse shocks, or from more distant pre-existing dust grains in the SN environment. Furthermore, the large 4.6 μm excess at late times can also be explained by the emergence of the carbon monoxide 1–0 vibrational band. SN 2023ixf is the best-observed SN II in the mid-IR during the first several days after the explosion and one of the most luminous such SNe ever seen.

The magnetic field vector of the solar corona is not regularly and comprehensively being measured because of the complexity and degeneracy inherently present in the types of observations currently available. To address some of the current limitations of coronal polarimetry, we present computations that demonstrate the possibility of magnetometry using the unsaturated Hanle effect of the He i 1083 nm line. The main purpose of this investigation is to show how the linear polarization of this line can be used to routinely diagnose the orientation of the field in erupting prominences, thus providing an important constraint on the Bz determination at 1 AU. For this work, we adopted a simplified magnetic model of a flux rope, consisting of a toroidal helical structure embedded in a hydrostatically stratified corona. Our results demonstrate the possibility to discern different orientations of the magnetic field vector in such structures under rather general and practicable viewing conditions. In particular, observations from the Sun–Earth Lagrange points are found to provide excellent locations for the deployment of synoptic instruments aiming at the estimation of the magnetic field of Earth-directed coronal mass ejections. We complete our demonstration by showing how a small (∼5 cm) space-borne coronagraph can achieve sufficient signal-to-noise ratios to make the coronal magnetometry goal outlined above feasible.

<title>Asymmetries in the Simulated Ozone Distribution on TRAPPIST-1e due to Orography</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8f2f</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
TRAPPIST-1e is a tidally locked rocky exoplanet orbiting the habitable zone of an M dwarf star. Upcoming observations are expected to reveal new rocky exoplanets and their atmospheres around M dwarf stars. To interpret these future observations we need to model the atmospheres of such exoplanets. We configured Community Earth System Model version 2–Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 6, a chemistry climate model, for the orbit and stellar irradiance of TRAPPIST-1e assuming an initial Earth-like atmospheric composition. Our aim is to characterize the possible ozone (O3) distribution and explore how this is influenced by the atmospheric circulation shaped by orography, using the Helmholtz wind decomposition and meridional mass streamfunction. The model included Earth-like orography, and the substellar point was located over the Pacific Ocean. For such a scenario, our analysis reveals a north–south asymmetry in the simulated O3 distribution. The O3 concentration is highest at pressures >10 hPa (below ∼30 km) near the south pole. This asymmetry arises from the higher landmass fraction in the northern hemisphere, which causes drag in near-surface flows and leads to an asymmetric meridional overturning circulation. Catalytic species were roughly symmetrically distributed and were not found to be primary driver for the O3 asymmetry. The total O3 column density was higher for TRAPPIST-1e compared to Earth, with 8000 Dobson units (DUs) near the south pole and 2000 DU near the north pole. The results emphasize the sensitivity of O3 to model parameters, illustrating how incorporating Earth-like orography can affect atmospheric dynamics and O3 distribution. This link between surface features and atmospheric dynamics underlines the importance of how changing model parameters used to study exoplanet atmospheres can influence the interpretation of observations.

<title>Are There Black Hole Symbiotic X-Ray Binaries?</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90ab</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90ab</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
While there are over a dozen known neutron star (NS) symbiotic X-ray binaries (SyXBs) in the Galaxy, no SyXBs containing a black hole (BH) have been detected. We address this problem by incorporating binary population synthesis and the accretion properties of BHs fed by the wind from red giant companions. We investigate the impact of different supernova mechanisms, kick velocity distributions, and wind velocities on the formation of both NS and BH SyXBs. Our simulations show that the number of BH SyXBs is at most one-sixth of that of NS SyXBs in the Galaxy provided that the common envelope efficiency parameter α ∼ 0.3–5, and less than ∼10 BH SyXBs could be detectable in X-ray, considering their low radiation efficiencies. These findings indicate a scarcity of BH SyXBs in the Galaxy.

<title>Distribution and Anisotropy of the Energy Transfer Rate in the Solar Wind Turbulence</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90b2</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90b2</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The distribution of the energy transfer rate is critical for the interpretation of the intermittent energy cascade in the solar wind turbulence. However, the true observational distribution of the energy transfer rate in the solar wind and its anisotropy remain unknown. Here, we use a 7 day interval measured by Wind in the fast solar wind and investigate the distribution and anisotropy of the energy transfer rate based on the log-Poisson model. We find that the probability density distribution consists of two parts. The majority part locates at smaller values and is consistent with the log-normal distribution. The estimated mean value and standard deviation of the logarithmic energy transfer rate for the majority are both smaller in the direction parallel to the local mean magnetic field than in the perpendicular direction. The mean value displays a power-law shape with respect to the scale, with flatter index in the parallel direction and steeper index in the perpendicular direction. The minority part locates at larger values and expands as the scale decreases, indicating the growing intermittency toward smaller scales. The flatness for parallel logarithmic energy transfer rate is larger than that for perpendicular. And it rises as the scale decreases for all directions, demonstrating the relatively longer tail of the distribution with decreasing scale. Our results provide new insight to help interpret the intermittent energy cascade process in the solar wind turbulence.

<title>Revisiting the Chemical Composition of WD 1145+017: Impact of Circumstellar Disk Contamination on Photospheric Abundances</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90b7</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90b7</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We performed a chemical analysis of the asteroid-bearing white dwarf WD 1145+017 using optical and ultraviolet spectroscopic data from 25 epochs between 2015 and 2023. We present an updated gas disk model with improved opacity calculations and temperature profiles to properly account for all circumstellar absorption features. Incorporating these changes into our models, we identified at least 11 elements in the disk, including a detection of circumstellar Na. We detected 16 elements in the photosphere, including new detections of P, Co, and Cu. At 16 elements, WD 1145+017 ties GD 362 as one of the most polluted white dwarfs in terms of the number of elements detected. We find that both the disk and photosphere compositions align, to first order, with CI Chondrite. Our study underscores the importance of accounting for circumstellar absorption, as neglecting them leads to significant abundance errors. Additionally, the analysis of the disk’s opacity highlighted an ultraviolet flux reduction due to a pseudo-continuum due to an optically thick component. This result may affect previous analyses of other polluted white dwarfs, suggesting a need for revisiting some studies.

<title>OCS2 Isomers in the Venusian Atmospheric Chemistry: Spectroscopic Characterization and Photochemistry</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9270</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The atmosphere of Venus exhibits absorption in the 300–500 nm wavelength range, which is driven by unknown chemical processes. In our study, we explore electronic transitions in molecules that may exist in the Venusian atmosphere, specifically focusing on the photoabsorption cross sections and the lowest singlet and triplet electronic states of the OCS2, SSCO, and OSCS isomers using highly accurate ab initio methods. Our analysis suggests that the SSCO isomer is a strong candidate for explaining the unknown UV absorption. Furthermore, these isomers may serve as significant astrochemical reservoirs in the atmosphere of Venus, where photodissociation could produce atomic sulfur in both its ground and excited states along with OCS and CS2, offering a plausible mechanism for the sulfur cycle dynamics and the formation of Sx species. This study provides valuable insights into the complex sulfur chemistry within the atmosphere of Venus.

<title>COBIPULSE: A Systematic Search for Compact Binary Millisecond Pulsars</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad89a3</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad89a3</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report here the results obtained from a systematic optical photometric survey aimed at finding new compact binary millisecond pulsars (also known as “spiders”): the COmpact BInary PULsar SEarch. We acquired multiband optical images over 1 yr around 33 unidentified Fermi Large Area Telescope sources, selected as pulsar candidates based on their curved GeV spectra and steady γ-ray emission. We present the discovery of four optical variables coinciding with the Fermi sources 3FGL J0737.2−3233, 3FGL J2117.6+3725 (two systems in this field), and 3FGL J2221.6+6507, which we propose as new candidate spider systems. Indeed, they all show optical flux modulation consistent with orbital periods of 0.3548(5), 0.25328(6), 0.441961(2), and 0.165(4) days, respectively, with amplitudes ≳0.3 mag and colors compatible with companion star temperatures of 5000–6000 K. These properties are consistent with the “redback” subclass of spider pulsars. If confirmed as a millisecond pulsar, 3FGL J0737.2−3233 will be the closest known spider to Earth ( , from Gaia-DR3 parallax). We searched and did not find any X-ray sources matching our four candidates, placing 3σ upper limits of ∼1031–1032 erg s−1 (0.3–10 keV) on their soft X-ray luminosities. We also present and discuss other multiwavelength information on our spider candidates, from infrared to X-rays.

<title>JWST/NIRCam Narrowband Survey of Paβ Emitters in the Spiderweb Protocluster at z = 2.16</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the initial result of our Paβ narrowband imaging on a protocluster with the JWST Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam). As NIRCam enables deep narrowband imaging of rest-frame near-infrared lines at z > 1, we target one of the most studied protoclusters, the Spiderweb protocluster at z = 2.16, in which previous studies have confirmed more than a hundred member galaxies. The NIRCam F405N narrowband filter covers in the Paβ line the protocluster redshift given by known protocluster members, allowing for the search for new member candidates. The weight-corrected color–magnitude diagram obtained 57 sources showing narrowband excesses, 41 of which satisfy further color selection criteria for limiting the sample to Paβ emitter candidates at z ∼ 2.16, and 24 of them do not have Hα emitter counterparts. The Paβ emitter candidates appear to follow the spatial distribution of known protocluster members; however, follow-up spectroscopic confirmation is required. Only 17 out of 58 known Hα-emitting cluster members are selected as Paβ emitters in the current data, albeit the rest fall out of the narrowband selection owing to their small Paβ equivalent widths. We derive the Paβ luminosity function in the Spiderweb protocluster, showing a normalization density of at a characteristic Paβ luminosity of . Furthermore, we examine the possibility of detecting faint line emitters visible only in the narrowband image but find no promising candidates.

<title>JWST/NIRCam Paβ Narrowband Imaging Reveals Ordinary Dust Extinction for Hα Emitters within the Spiderweb Protocluster at z = 2.16</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We combine JWST/NIRCam and Subaru/MOIRCS dual Paβ+Hα narrowband imaging to trace the dust attenuation and the star formation activities of a sample of 43 Hα emitters at the core of one of the most massive and best-studied clusters in formation at the cosmic noon: the Spiderweb protocluster at z = 2.16. We find that most Hα emitters display Paβ/Hα ratios compatible with Case B recombination conditions, which translates into nebular extinction values ranging at AV ≈ 0–3 mag, and dust corrected Paβ star formation rates consistent with coeval main sequence field galaxies at fixed stellar mass ( ) during this cosmic epoch. Furthermore, we investigate possible environmental impacts on dust extinction across the protocluster large-scale structure and find no correlation between the dustiness of its members and environmental proxies such as phase-space position, clustercentric radius, or local density. These results support the scenario for which dust production within the main galaxy population of this protocluster is driven by secular star formation activities fueled by smooth gas accretion across its large-scale structure. This downplays the role of gravitational interactions in boosting star formation and dust production within the Spiderweb protocluster, in contrast with observations in higher redshift and less evolved protocluster cores.

<title>Fate of the Remnant in Tidal Stripping Event: Repeating and Nonrepeating</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b24</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b24</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Tidal disruption events (TDE) occur when a star ventures too close to a massive black hole. In a partial TDE (pTDE), the star only grazes the tidal radius, causing the outer envelope of the star to be stripped away while the stellar core survives. Previous research has shown that a star, once tidally stripped in a parabolic orbit, can acquire enough orbital energy for its remnant to become a high-velocity star potentially capable of escaping the galaxy. Conversely, some studies have reported that the remnant may lose orbital energy and undergo re-disruption, leading to a recurring pTDE. This study aims to uncover the physical mechanisms and determine the conditions that lead to these divergent outcomes. We find that the orbital energy change only depends on the impact factor and the stellar structure, and barely depends on the mass of the black hole or the exact mass or orbital eccentricity of the star. For a γ = 5/3 (or γ = 4/3) polytropic star, after a pTDE its remnant gains orbital energy when the impact factor β ≳ 0.62 (or ≳1.1) or loses energy and vice versa. Additionally, we verify an analytical equation for orbital energy change that is applicable across various systems. Through hydrodynamic simulations, we also explore the structure of the stellar remnant post-tidal stripping. Our findings provide critical insights for interpreting observed pTDEs and advancing knowledge on the orbital evolution and event rate of these events.

<title>The Nature of a Recently Discovered Wolf–Rayet Binary: Archetype of Stripping?*</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8a59</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8a59</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
LMCe055-1 was recently discovered in a survey for Wolf–Rayets (WRs) in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and classified as a WN4/O4, a lower-excitation version of the WN3/O3 class discovered as part of the same survey. Its absolute magnitude precluded it from being a WN4+O4 binary. Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment photometry shows shallow primary and secondary eclipses with a 2.2 days period. The spectral characteristics and short period pointed to a possible origin due to binary stripping. Such stripped WR binaries should be common but have proven elusive to identify conclusively. In order to establish its nature, we obtained Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet and Magellan optical spectra, along with imaging. Our work shows that the WR emission and He ii absorption arise in one star, and the He i absorption in another. The He i contributor is the primary of the 2.2 days system and exhibits ∼300 km s−1 radial velocity variations on that timescale. However, the WR star shows 30–40 km s−1 radial velocity variations, with a likely 35 days period and a highly eccentric orbit. Possibly LMCe055-1 is a physical triple, but that would require the 2.2 days pair to have been captured by the WR star. A more likely explanation is that the WR star has an unseen companion in a 35 days orbit and that the 2.2 days pair is in a longer-period orbit about the two. Such examples of multiple systems are well known among massive stars, such as HD 5980. Regardless, we argue that it is highly unlikely that the WR component of the LMCe055-1 system resulted from stripping.

<title>Mining for Protoclusters at z ∼ 4 from Photometric Data Sets with Deep Learning</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8a67</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Protoclusters are high-z overdense regions that will evolve into clusters of galaxies by z = 0, making them ideal for studying galaxy evolution expected to be accelerated by environmental effects. However, it has been challenging to identify protoclusters beyond z = 3 only by photometry due to large redshift uncertainties hindering statistical study. To tackle the issue, we develop a new deep-learning-based protocluster detection model, PCFNet, which considers a protocluster as a point cloud. To detect protoclusters at z ∼ 4 using only optical broadband photometry, we train and evaluate PCFNet with mock g-dropout galaxies based on the N-body simulation with the semianalytic model. We use the sky distribution, i-band magnitude, (g − i) color, and the redshift probability density function surrounding a target galaxy on the sky. PCFNet detects 5 times more protocluster member candidates while maintaining high purity (recall = 7.5% ± 0.2%, precision = 44% ± 1%) than conventional methods. Moreover, PCFNet is able to detect more progenitors ( ) that are less massive than supermassive clusters like the Coma cluster. We apply PCFNet to the observational photometric data set of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Strategic Survey Program Deep/UltraDeep layer (∼17 deg2) and detect 121 protocluster candidates at z ∼ 4. We find that the rest-UV luminosities of our protocluster member candidates are brighter than those of field galaxies, which is consistent with previous studies. Additionally, the quenching of satellite galaxies depends on both the core galaxy’s halo mass at z ∼ 4 and accumulated mass until z = 0 in the simulation. PCFNet is very flexible and can find protoclusters at other redshifts or in future extensive surveys by Euclid, Legacy Survey of Space and Time, and Roman.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We use spectroscopic redshifts obtained with the WIYN 3.5 m telescope to study the local galactic environment around 18 Green Pea (GP) galaxies. Our sample of GPs were discovered in the Hα Dot Survey via their [O iii]λ5007 emission and span the redshift range 0.32 < z < 0.34. We present the environmental analyses near the location of the Hα Dot GPs. We utilize three different density estimators, chosen based on the geometry of the redshift survey data within the Hα Dot GP fields. We classify each Hα Dot GP into an environment category, from extremely isolated to highly clustered. We find that our entire sample of Hα Dot GPs reside in extremely isolated or low-density environments, with none located in the intermediate- to high-density regimes. We interpret this to indicate that major mergers and interactions do not drive the activity seen in these galaxies.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Classical Wolf–Rayet (W-R) stars are the descendants of massive OB stars that have lost their hydrogen envelopes and are burning helium in their cores prior to exploding as Type Ib/c supernovae. The mechanisms for losing their hydrogen envelopes are either through binary interactions or through strong stellar winds potentially coupled with episodic mass loss. Among the bright classical W-R stars, the binary system WR 137 (HD 192641; WC7d + O9e) is the subject of this paper. This binary is known to have a 13 yr period and produces dust near periastron. Here we report on interferometry with the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy Array collected over a decade of time and providing the first visual orbit for the system. We combine these astrometric measurements with archival radial velocities to measure masses of the stars of MWR = 9.5 ± 3.4 M⊙ and MO = 17.3 ± 1.9 M⊙ when we use the most recent Gaia distance. These results are then compared to predicted dust distribution using these orbital elements, which match the observed imaging from JWST as discussed recently by Lau et al. Furthermore, we compare the system to the Binary Population And Spectral Synthesis models, finding that the W-R star likely formed through stellar winds and not through binary interactions. However, the companion O star did likely accrete some material from the W-R star’s mass loss to provide the rotation seen today that drives its status as an Oe star.

<title>On the Acceleration Site of Anomalous Cosmic Rays: Voyager 2 Observations of Their Anisotropy in the Heliosheath</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the diffusive flow anisotropy vector components for ∼0.5–35 MeV anomalous cosmic-ray (ACR) protons observed during Voyager 2 roll maneuvers for the magnetometer instrument in the inner heliosheath. The diffusive flow results are derived from the differences between the observed anisotropy components presented in A. C. Cummings et al. (2021) and the Compton–Getting anisotropies based on measurements of the solar wind speeds from the Plasma Science instrument. We find that the tangential component of the derived diffusive anisotropy vector is in reasonable agreement, both in direction and magnitude, with a numerical model of the acceleration and transport of ACRs by diffusive shock acceleration along a nonspherical solar wind termination shock (TS). The results suggest that there exists a diffusive flow of these particles from the flank or tail of the heliosphere toward the nose, and support models in which higher-energy ACRs are accelerated in the flank or tail of the TS.

<title>Weak Lensing Analysis of A2390 Using Short Exposures</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad7c4f</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a weak lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster A2390 at z = 0.23 using second moment shape measurements made in 411 short 60 s exposures. The exposures are obtained in three broadband photometric filters (g, r, and i) using WIYN-ODI. Shape measurement in individual exposures is done using a moment-matching algorithm. Forced measurement is used when the moment-matching algorithm fails to converge at low signal-to-noise ratio. The measurements made in individual images are combined using inverse error weighting to obtain accurate shapes for the sources and hence recover shear. We use PhoSim simulations to validate the shear measurements recovered by our pipeline. We find the mass of A2390 is in agreement with previously published results. We also find the E-mode maps show filamentary structures consistent with baryonic structures and recover most clusters/groups of galaxies found using optical and X-ray data. Thus, we demonstrate the feasibility of using weak lensing to map large-scale structure of the Universe. We also find the central portion of the cluster has a bimodal mass distribution and the relative orientation of the peaks is similar to X-ray. We discuss earlier research on this galaxy cluster, and show that a late-stage merger accounts for all the observed data.

<title>Investigation of Individual Pulse Emission Behaviors from Pulsar J1741–0840</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have carried out a detailed study of individual pulse emission from the pulsar J1741−0840 (B1738−08) observed using the Parkes and Effelsberg radio telescopes at the L band. The pulsar exhibits four emission components, which are not well resolved by employing multicomponent Gaussian fitting. The radio emission originates at a height of approximately 1000 km, with the viewing geometry characterized by inclination and impact angles roughly estimated at 81° and 3°, respectively. Fluctuation spectral analysis of single pulse behavior reveals two prominent periodicities, around 32 and five rotation periods. The longer periodic modulation feature is linked to nulling behavior across the entire emission window, with an updated nulling fraction of 23% ± 2% derived from pulse energy distribution via Gaussian mixture modeling. In addition to quasiperiodic nulling, the pulsar also exhibits the presence of subpulse drifting in the trailing component, with the shorter periodic feature in the fluctuation spectra related to the phenomenon of subpulse drifting, and the longitudinal separation estimated to be about 5°. Both periodic modulations show significant temporal evolution with time-dependent fluctuation power. The implications of understanding the radio emission mechanisms are discussed.

<title>Fe/O Variations Relative to Source Longitude and Heliospheric Current Sheet in Large Solar Energetic Particle Events</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Fe/O enhancements exhibit significant variations in gradual solar energetic particle (SEP) events. Several causes have been suggested including transport effects in the interplanetary space and flare contribution. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the integrated Fe/O ratios of 27 gradual SEP events, locations of associated solar flares, and positions along the heliospheric current sheet (HCS) between 2010 and 2014. We employ synchronic potential field source surface (PFSS) extrapolations at 2.5R⊙, derived in near real-time using Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated far side and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) magnetograms, referred to as AIHMI-PFSS extrapolations. We examine low-energy (∼0.5 MeV/nucleon) Fe and O ion measurements obtained from Suprathermal Ion Telescope on Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatories and Ultra Low Energy Isotope Spectrometer on Advanced Composition Explorer. We found a moderate anticorrelation between the Fe/O ratios and the absolute longitudinal separation angles from the source regions to the spacecraft magnetic footpoints. Furthermore, we investigate the variations in Fe/O ratios with respect to the separation angle, grouped by the same and opposite polarity sectors of the SEP source regions. We found that the mean and median Fe/O values are higher in the same polarity group compared to the opposite polarity group, with the largest contrast at separation angles between 25° and 50°, where the values are approximately 3 times larger. The results imply that the enhanced Fe/O ratios in the examined gradual SEP events are likely associated with direct source regions, while the HCS affects particle transport.

<title>Origins of Very Low Helium Abundance Streams Detected in the Solar Wind Plasma</title>

The abundance of helium (AHe) in the solar wind exhibits variations typically in the range from 2% to 5% with respect to solar cycle activity and solar wind velocity. However, there are instances where the observed AHe is exceptionally low (<1%). These low-AHe occurrences are detected both near the Sun and at 1 au. The low-AHe events are generally observed near the heliospheric current sheet. We analyzed 28 low-AHe events observed by the Wind spacecraft and 4 by Parker Solar Probe to understand their origin. In this work, we make use of the ADAPT-WSA model to derive the sources of our events at the base of the solar corona. The modeling suggests that the low-AHe events originated from the boundaries of coronal holes, primarily from large quiescent helmet streamers. We argue that the cusp above the core of the streamer can produce such very low helium abundance events. The streamer core serves as an ideal location for gravitational settling to occur as demonstrated by previous models, leading to the release of this plasma through reconnection near the cusp, resulting in low-AHe events. Furthermore, observations from Ulysses provide direct evidence that these events originated from coronal streamers.

<title>Far-side Active Regions Based on Helioseismic and EUV Measurements: A New Data Set for Heliospheric Machine Learning Advancements</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Active Regions (ARs) are regions of strong magnetic flux in the solar atmosphere. Understanding the global evolution of ARs is critical for solar magnetism as well as for accurate space-weather forecasting. We present the first far-side AR data set based on EUV observation and helioseismic measurements. For the EUV observations, we use synchronic maps at 304 Å comprised of observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory/Extreme UltraViolet Imager, in heliocentric orbit with direct vantages into the Sun’s far hemisphere. We used the brightening of the solar transition region in EUV/304 Å maps as a proxy for the magnetic regions. For the far-side helioseismic measurements, we used seismic phase-shift maps of the Sun’s far hemisphere, computed from helioseismic Dopplergrams observed by NSO/Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG). In this study, we present the first global EUV AR data set of the whole Sun, providing several basic parameters, such as location, area, tilt angle, EUV brightness, and latitudinal/longitudinal extents of the identified ARs. We also present a similar data set for the far-side GONG ARs where the helioseismic phase shift parameters are included. Helioseismic far-side GONG ARs are examined, and their success at predicting strong ARs is assessed. We discuss the temporal and spatial evolution for the EUV AR signatures and far-side GONG AR signatures during the ascending and maximum phases of Solar Cycle 24 (2010 May–2016 May). We examine the correlation between the helioseismic signatures and the respective EUV source distributions in the Sun’s far hemisphere. We present the first far-side AR butterfly diagram based on helioseismic measurements.

<title>First Observation of the Complete Rotation Period of the Ultraslowly Rotating Magnetic O Star HD 54879</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad865a</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad865a</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
HD 54879 is the most recently discovered magnetic O-type star. Previous studies ruled out a rotation period shorter than 7 yr, implying that HD 54879 is the second most slowly rotating known magnetic O-type star. We report new high-resolution spectropolarimetric measurements of HD 54879, which confirm that a full stellar rotation cycle has been observed. We derive a stellar rotation period from the longitudinal magnetic field measurements of days (about 7.02 yr). The radial velocity of HD 54879 has been stable over the last decade of observations. We explore equivalent widths and longitudinal magnetic fields calculated from lines of different elements, and conclude the atmosphere of HD 54879 is likely chemically homogeneous, with no strong evidence for chemical stratification or lateral abundance nonuniformities. We present the first detailed magnetic map of the star, with an average surface-magnetic-field strength of 2954 G, and a strength for the dipole component of 3939 G. There is a significant amount of magnetic energy in the quadrupole components of the field (23%). Thus, we find HD 54879 has a strong magnetic field with a significantly complex topology.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
CIZA J2242.8+5301, or the Sausage cluster, is well-studied over a range of frequencies. Since its first discovery, a lot of interesting features and unique characteristics have been uncovered. In this work, we report some more new morphological features using the uGMRT band-3 and band-4 data. In the north relic, we observe variation in the spectral index profiles across the relic width from the east to west, which may indicate a decrease in the downstream cooling rate in that direction. We reconfirm the presence of an additional ∼930 kpc relic in the north. We classify the filamentary source in the downstream region to be a narrow-angle tail (NAT) radio galaxy. The bright arc in the east relic shows a substructure in the spectral index profile, which may indicate the presence of finer filaments. We further report the presence of a double-strand structure in the east relic similar to the “Toothbrush” relic. We categorize the bright “L”-shaped structure in the southern relic to be a NAT radio galaxy, as well as trace the actual ∼1.1 Mpc relic component. We reconfirm the existence of the faint southern extent, measuring the relic length to be ∼1.8 Mpc. Furthermore, we suggest the southern relic to be a union of individual component relics rather than a single giant filamentary relic. Lastly, based on the morphological symmetry between northern and southern relics, we suggest a schematic shock structure associated with the merger event in an attempt to explain their formation scenario.

<title>Connecting the X-Ray/UV Variability of Fairall 9 with NICER: A Possible Warm Corona</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8dc2</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Seyfert 1 active galactic nucleus Fairall 9 was targeted by NICER, Swift, and ground-based observatories for a ∼1000 day long reverberation mapping campaign. The following analysis of NICER spectra taken at a 2 day cadence provides new insights into the structure and heating mechanisms of the central black hole environment. Observations of Fairall 9 with NICER and Swift revealed a strong relationship between the flux of the UV continuum and the X-ray soft excess, indicating the presence of a “warm” Comptonized corona that likely lies in the upper layers of the innermost accretion flow, serving as a second reprocessor between the “hot” X-ray corona and the accretion disk. The X-ray emission from the hot corona lacks sufficient energy and variability to power slow changes in the UV light curve on timescales of 30 days or longer, suggesting an intrinsic disk-driven variability process in the UV and soft X-rays. Fast variability in the UV on timescales shorter than 30 days can be explained through X-ray reprocessing, and the observed weak X-ray/UV correlation suggests that the corona changes dynamically throughout the campaign.

<title>The Impact of Water Clouds on the Prospective Emission Spectrum of Teegarden’s Star b as Observed by LIFE</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8f30</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8f30</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Nontransiting terrestrial planets will be accessible by upcoming observatories of which LIFE is an example. Planet b orbiting Teegarden’s Star is one of the optimal targets for such missions. We use a one-dimensional atmospheric model with real gas radiation, a multispecies pseudo-adiabatic convection-condensation scheme, and a water cloud scheme to estimate the impact of the cloud coverage on the emission spectrum of the target, as well as to assess how sensitive LIFE could be to changes in outgoing flux caused by these clouds. Though the emergent flux decreases with a higher cloud coverage, it does not decrease by more than 1 order of magnitude as the coverage increases from 0% to 90%. This allows LIFE to retain a high sensitivity to the cloud cover fraction for wavelengths longer than 7 μm. In this spectral range, with at least 1 bar of N2, LIFE is able to distinguish cloud cover fractions as small as 10% given an integration time of 24 hr, and yields much better precision with a week-long integration. An integration time of 1 week also allows the resolution of local variations in spectral flux, which can lead to easier molecule identification. This ability remains if the planet is a CO2-dominated Venus analog. Partial pressures of N2 lower than 1 bar may create a degeneracy with the cloud cover fraction. LIFE shows promising potential for detecting and characterizing atmospheres even with a high cloud coverage, and retaining a fine sensitivity to relatively small differences in cloud cover fractions.

<title>Modeling Competing Line-broadening Mechanisms in Neutron Star Atmospheres: Interference between Motional Stark and Ion Broadening</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8f34</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8f34</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Neutron star surfaces have extremely high magnetic fields. In the atmosphere, the broadening of spectral lines will be substantial from the dense plasma as well as from the magnetic field. One broadening mechanism of note is due to the motional Stark effect (MSE)—an additional electric field that arises from the motion of the atom in the magnetic field. However, approximate formulae are often used to construct atmosphere models, and the MSE is assumed to be the dominant line-broadening mechanism even in ions. Detailed pressure-broadening models in these extreme magnetic fields are now currently being developed. In these more detailed models, it was suggested that the MSE may not be as large as previously predicted. If correct, this hypothesis implies that neutron star line widths might be dominated by pressure broadening rather than by motional Stark broadening. We find that, in the absence of plasma perturbations, for typical magnetic fields (B = 1012 G), mid-Z elements, such as oxygen, have motional Stark widths of order 1 eV for transitions between dipole-allowed transitions from the ground state, though higher temperatures and transitions to higher-energy states are expected to have more broadening. The MSE also breaks down selection rules, giving rise to forbidden transitions, which have much larger widths. When plasma perturbations are included, we find that the plasma perturbation and motional Stark processes are not independent and, as a result, the spectral lines become narrow in a nontrivial way and display harmonics of the ion cyclotron frequency.

<title>Evidence for a Sharp CO Snow Line Transition in a Protoplanetary Disk and Implications for Millimeter-wave Observations of CO Isotopologues</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8d55</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8d55</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Observations of CO isotopologue emission from protoplanetary disks at millimeter wavelengths are a powerful tool for probing the CO snow line, an important marker for disk chemistry, and also for estimating total disk gas mass, a key quantity for planet formation. We use simple models to demonstrate that the vertical thickness of an isothermal layer around the disk midplane has important effects on the CO column density radial profile, with a thick layer producing a sharp CO snow line transition. We simulate next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) images to show that this sharp change in the CO column density can be detected in the derivative of the radial profile of emission from optically thin CO isotopologue lines. We apply this method to archival ALMA observations of the disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 163296 in the C17O and C18O J = 1–0 and J = 2–1 lines to identify a sharp CO snow line transition near ∼80 au (0.″8 at 101 pc), and show the CO column density decreases by more than a factor of 20. This finding is consistent with previous inferences from the steep rise of N2H+ emission, which marks the location where CO depletes. We also demonstrate that the disk’s thermal structure introduces significant systematic uncertainty to estimates of total disk gas mass derived from these lines. The substantial improvement in sensitivity envisioned for the ngVLA over ALMA for observations of ground-state lines of CO isotopologues has the potential to extend this approach to a much larger population of disks.

<title>Revealing the Quiescent Galaxy Population in the Spiderweb Protocluster at z = 2.16 with Deep HST/WFC3 Slitless Spectroscopy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 G141 grism slitless spectroscopy observation of the core region of the Spiderweb protocluster at z = 2.16. We analyzed the spectra of all objects in a field of view and identified 40 protocluster members, recovering 19 previously identified Hα emitters in addition to revealing 21 new members. The spectra allowed us to identify 11 galaxies with quiescent spectra. In all, 3 galaxies with quiescent spectra are possibly still star forming according to spectral energy distribution fitting, indicating a possible leftover or dust-obscured star formation. We estimate a quiescent fraction of ∼50% for M⋆ > 1011M⊙. About half of the quiescent galaxies possibly host an active galactic nucleus (AGN), hinting at AGN’s key role in quenching galaxies in the protocluster environment. These quiescent galaxies have relatively more compact and concentrated light profiles than the star-forming members, but they are not yet as bulge dominated as local ellipticals. These results are consistent with previous studies that indicate the Spiderweb protocluster is in the maturing stage, with a red sequence that has begun forming.

<title>Exploring Field-evolution and Dynamical-capture Coalescing Binary Black Holes in GWTC-3</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad83b5</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad83b5</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate formation channels for merging binary black holes (BBHs) in GWTC-3, with a dedicated semiparametric population model. The model first describes or excludes a high-spin (with magnitudes of ∼0.7) and high-mass (ranging in ∼20–80M⊙) subpopulation, which was identified by previous works and can be interpreted as hierarchical mergers. We find that the rest of BBH population can be categorized into two subpopulations with different mass and mass-ratio distributions, as indicated by a Bayes factor of . One subpopulation, characterized by nearly aligned spins and consistent with isolated field formation, likely dominates the 10-solar-mass peak in the primary-mass function. The other subpopulation, with isotropic spins and consistent with the dynamical channels, shows a stronger preference for symmetric pairing, and mainly contributes to the 35-solar-mass peak in the primary-mass function. Note that the Bayes factor is not high enough with the currently available data, so that the case of a single population is still acceptable. Additionally, we compare the mass distributions between merging BBHs and black holes (BHs) in high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs). We find that the primary mass of the aligned subpopulation is slightly lighter than those of the HMXB BHs, while the isotropic subpopulation is consistent with the HMXB BHs, if the power-law index of its mass function is shifted by 2, as indicated by the dynamical formation channels. However, the spin magnitudes of both subpopulations are significantly smaller than those of the HMXB BHs.

<title>Misaligned Gas Acquisition as a Formation Pathway of S0 Galaxies</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8c3d</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We analyze a sample of 753 S0 galaxies from the MPL-10 of Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory survey and investigate the gas–star kinematic misalignment and merger remnant fraction in galaxies with different morphological types. The misalignment fraction in S0s is the highest among all the morphological types for both young (global Dn4000 < 1.6, ∼15%) and old (global Dn4000 > 1.6, ∼10%) galaxies. We compare the properties of misaligned S0s with other types of galaxies, finding the following: (i) misaligned S0s and misaligned spirals have higher bulge luminosity, higher bulge-to-total light ratio, and larger Sérsic index compared to spirals; (ii) the misaligned S0s have lower bulge luminosity Mr and smaller bulge size than merger remnant S0s, while aligned S0s have the widest coverage for these parameter distributions, which are overlapped with both misaligned S0s and merger remnant S0s; (iii) misaligned S0s have lower stellar mass M* and more isolated environment than aligned S0s and merger remnant S0s; and (iv) the young misaligned S0s have positive Dn4000 radial gradient, while the aligned S0s and merger remnant S0s show negative Dn4000 radial gradient. Combining all these observational results, we suggest misaligned gas acquisition as another efficient formation pathway for S0 galaxies. The redistribution of gas angular momentum during gas–gas collision between accreted and preexisting gas leads to gas inflow and the growth of the bulge component, while the lack of cold gas at the outskirts leads to fading of spiral arms.

Small planets (≲1 M⊕) at intermediate orbital distances (∼1 au) represent an uncharted territory in exoplanetary science. The upcoming microlensing survey by the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will be sensitive to objects as light as Ganymede and unveil the small planet population at 1–10 au. Instrumental sensitivity to such planets is low, and the number of objects we will discover is strongly dependent on the underlying planet mass function. In this work, we provide a physically motivated planet mass function by combining the efficiency of planet formation by pebble accretion with the observed disk mass function. Because the disk mass function for M dwarfs (0.4–0.6 M⊙) is bottom heavy, the initial planet mass function is also expected to be bottom heavy, skewing toward Ganymede and Mars mass objects, more so for heavier initial planetary seeds. We follow the subsequent dynamical evolution of planetary systems over ∼100 Myr varying the initial eccentricity and orbital spacing. For initial planet separations of ≥3 local disk scale heights, we find that Ganymede and Mars mass planets do not grow significantly by mergers. However, Earth-like planets undergo vigorous merging and turn into super-Earths, potentially creating a gap in the planet mass function at ∼1 M⊕. Our results demonstrate that the slope of the mass function and the location of the potential gap in the mass function can probe the initial architecture of multiplanet systems. We close by discussing implications on the expected difference between bound and free-floating planet mass functions.

<title>On the Influence of the Solar Wind on the Propagation of Earth-impacting Coronal Mass Ejections</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8e63</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are subject to changes in their direction of propagation, tilt, and other properties as they interact with the variable solar wind. We investigated the heliospheric propagation of 15 Earth-impacting CMEs observed during 2010 April to 2018 August in the field of view (FOV) of the Heliospheric Imager (HI) on board the STEREO. About half of the 15 events followed self-similar expansion up to 40 R⊙. The remaining events showed deflection either in latitude, longitude, or a tilt change. Only 2 events showed significant rotation in the HI1 FOV. We also use toroidal and cylindrical flux rope fitting on the in situ observations of interplanetary magnetic field and solar wind parameters to estimate the tilt at L1 for these 2 events. Although the sample size is small, this study suggests that CME rotation is not very common in the heliosphere. We attributed the observed deflections and rotations of CMEs to a combination of factors, including their interaction with the ambient solar wind and the influence of the ambient magnetic field. These findings contribute to our understanding of the complex dynamics involved in CME propagation and highlight the need for comprehensive modeling and observational studies to improve space weather prediction. In particular, HI observations help us to connect observations near the Sun and near the Earth, improving our understanding of how CMEs move through the heliosphere.

<title>Accurately Estimating Redshifts from CSST Slitless Spectroscopic Survey Using Deep Learning</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8bbf</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) has the capability to conduct a slitless spectroscopic survey simultaneously with a photometric survey. The spectroscopic survey will measure slitless spectra, potentially providing more accurate estimations of galaxy properties, particularly redshifts, compared to using broadband photometry. CSST relies on these accurate redshifts to use baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) and other probes to constrain the cosmological parameters. However, due to the low resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of slitless spectra, measurement of redshifts is significantly challenging. In this study, we employ a Bayesian neural network (BNN) to assess the accuracy of redshift estimations from slitless spectra anticipated to be observed by CSST. The simulation of slitless spectra is based on real observational data from the early data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI-EDR) and the 16th data release of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS-DR16), combined with the 9th data release of the DESI Legacy Survey (DESI LS DR9). The BNN is constructed employing a transfer learning technique, by appending two Bayesian layers after a convolutional neural network, leveraging the features learned from the slitless spectra and corresponding redshifts. Our network can provide redshift estimates along with corresponding uncertainties, achieving an accuracy of σNMAD = 0.00063, outlier percentage η = 0.92%, and weighted mean uncertainty . These results successfully fulfill the requirement of σNMAD < 0.005 for BAO and other studies employing CSST slitless spectroscopic surveys.

Relativistic jets manifest some of the most intriguing activities in the nuclear regions of active galaxies. Identifying the most powerful relativistic jets permits us to probe the most luminous accretion systems and, in turn, the most massive black holes. This paper reports the identification of one such object, PMN J1310−5552 (z = 1.56), a blazar candidate of uncertain type detected with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) and Swift Burst Alert Telescope. The detection of broad emission lines in its optical spectra taken with the X-Shooter and Goodman spectrographs classifies it to be a flat-spectrum radio quasar. The analysis of the Goodman optical spectrum has revealed PMN J1310−5552 harbors a massive black hole (log scale MBH = 9.90 ± 0.07, in M⊙) and luminous accretion disk (log scale Ldisk = 46.86 ± 0.03, in erg s−1). The fitting of the observed big blue bump with the standard accretion disk model resulted in the log scale MBH (in M⊙) and Ldisk (in erg s−1), respectively. These parameters suggest PMN J1310−5552 hosts one of the most massive black holes and the most luminous accretion disks among the blazar population. The physical properties of this enigmatic blazar were studied by modeling the broadband spectral energy distribution considering the data from NuSTAR, Swift, Fermi-LAT, and archival observations. Overall, PMN J1310−5552 is a powerful “MeV” blazar with physical parameters similar to other members of this unique class of blazars. These results provide glimpses of monsters lurking among the unknown high-energy emitters and demonstrate the importance of ongoing wide-field sky surveys to discover them.

We have used the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to map H i 21 cm emission from the Green Pea galaxy GP J1148+2546 at z ≈ 0.0451, only the second measurement of the H i spatial distribution of a Green Pea. The VLA H i 21 cm image, the DECaLS optical image, and Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy show that GP J1148+2546 has two neighbors, the nearer of which is only ≈17.5 kpc away, and that the H i 21 cm emission extends in an inverted “C” shape around the Green Pea and its companions, with the highest H i column density between the two neighboring galaxies. The starburst in GP J1148+2546 is likely to have been triggered by the ongoing merger with its neighbors, although the velocity field and velocity dispersion images do not show clear merger signatures at the Green Pea location. The H i mass of the Green Pea and its immediate surroundings is (3.58 ± 0.37) × 109M⊙, a factor of ≈7.4 lower than the total H i mass of the system of three interacting galaxies, while the H i depletion timescale of GP J1148+2546 is ≈0.69 Gyr, much shorter than that of typical galaxies at z ≈ 0. We detect damped Lyα absorption and Lyα emission from the Green Pea in a Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph spectrum, obtaining a high H i column density, ≈2.0 × 1021 cm−2, and a low Lyα escape fraction, ≈0.8%, consistent with the relatively low value (≈5.4) of the ratio O32 ≡ [O iii]λ5007 + λ4959/[O ii]λ3727,3729.

<title>On the Stellar Disk Vertical Scale Height of Edge-on Galaxies from S4G</title>

Disk galaxies viewed as thin planar structures resulting from the conservation of angular momentum of an initially rotating pregalactic cloud allow merely a first-order model of galaxy formation, but the presence of vertically extended structures has allowed us to gather a deeper understanding of the richness in astrophysical processes (e.g., minor mergers, secular evolution) that ultimately results in the observed diversity in disk galaxies and their vertical extensions. We measure the stellar disk scale height of 46 edge-on spiral galaxies from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S4G) project. This paper aims to investigate the radial variation of the stellar disk vertical scale height and the existence of the so-called thick disk component in our sample. The measurements were made using one-, two-, and three-dimensional profile fitting techniques using simple models. We found that two-thirds of our sample show the presence of a thick disk, suggesting that these galaxies have been accreting gaseous material from their surroundings. We found an average thick-to-thin disk scale height ratio of 2.65, which is in good agreement with previous studies. Our findings also support the disk flaring model, which suggests that the vertical scale height increases with radius. We further found good correlations between the scale height hz and the scale length and between hz and the optical de Vaucouleurs radius R25.

<title>Observational Signatures of AGN Feedback in the Morphology and the Ionization States of Milky Way-like Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We make an in-depth analysis of different active galactic nuclei (AGN) jet models’ signatures, inducing quiescence in galaxies with a halo mass of 1012M⊙. Three jet models, including cosmic-ray-dominant, hot thermal, and precessing kinetic jets, are studied at two energy flux levels each, compared to a jet-free, stellar feedback-only simulation. Each of our simulations is idealized isolated galaxy simulations with AGN jet powers that are constant in time and generated using GIZMO and with FIRE stellar feedback. We examine the distribution of Mg ii, O vi, and O viii ions, alongside gas temperature and density profiles. Low-energy ions, like Mg ii, concentrate in the interstellar medium (ISM), while higher energy ions, e.g., O viii, prevail at the AGN jet cocoon’s edge. High-energy flux jets display an isotropic ion distribution with lower overall density. High-energy thermal or cosmic-ray jets pressurize at smaller radii, significantly suppressing core density. The cosmic-ray jet provides extra pressure support, extending cool and warm gas distribution. A break in the ion-to-mass ratio slope in O vi and O viii is demonstrated in the ISM-to-circumgalactic medium (CGM) transition (between 10 and 30 kpc), growing smoothly toward the CGM at greater distances.

<title>Strong Chemical Tagging in FIRE: Intra- and Intercluster Chemical Homogeneity in Open Clusters in Milky Way–like Galaxy Simulations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8bac</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Open-star clusters are the essential building blocks of the Galactic disk; “strong chemical tagging”—the premise that all star clusters can be reconstructed given chemistry information alone—is a driving force behind many current and upcoming large Galactic spectroscopic surveys. In this work, we characterize the abundance patterns for nine elements (C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ca, and Fe) in open clusters (OCs) in three galaxies (m12i, m12f, and m12m) from the Latte suite of FIRE-2 simulations, to investigate the feasibility of strong chemical tagging in these simulations. We select young massive (≥104.6M⊙) OCs formed in the last ∼100 Myr and calculate the intra- and intercluster abundance scatter for these clusters. We compare these results with analogous calculations drawn from observations of OCs in the Milky Way. We find the intracluster scatter of the observations and simulations to be comparable. While the abundance scatter within each cluster is minimal (≲0.020 dex), the mean abundance patterns of different clusters are not unique. We also calculate the chemical difference in intra- and intercluster star pairs and find it, in general, to be so small that it is difficult to distinguish between stars drawn from the same OC or from different OCs. Despite tracing three distinct nucleosynthetic families (core-collapse supernovae, white dwarf supernovae, and stellar winds), we conclude that these elemental abundances do not provide enough discriminating information to use strong chemical tagging for reliable OC membership.

<title>Comparison of the Chemical Compositions between the Bright and Faint Red Clumps for the Metal-poor and Metal-rich Populations in the Milky Way Bulge</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We examined the double red clump (RC) observed in the Galactic bulge, interpreted as a difference in distance (“X-shaped bulge scenario”) or in chemical composition (“multiple population scenario”). To verify chemical differences between the RC groups, we performed low-resolution spectroscopy for RC and red giant branch (RGB) stars using Gemini-South/GMOS in three fields of the bulge and collected diverse data from the literature. We divided our sample stars not only into bright RC (bRC) and faint RC (fRC) groups, but also into bluer ([Fe/H] < −0.1) and redder ([Fe/H] > −0.1) groups following recent u-band photometric studies. For the metal-poor stars, no statistically significant difference in the CN index was detected between the bright and faint RC groups for all observed fields. However, we found, from crossmatching with high-resolution spectroscopic data, a sign of Na enhancement in the “metal-poor and bright” RC group compared to the “metal-poor and faint” group at (l, b) = (−1°, −8.°5). When the contributions of the RGB stars on the RC regimes are taken into account, the Na abundance difference between genuine RCs would correspond to Δ[Na/Fe] ≃ 0.23 dex, similar to a globular cluster (GC) with multiple populations. In contrast, the metal-rich stars do not show chemical differences between the bright and faint RC groups. This implies that the double RC observed in the metal-poor component of the bulge might be linked to the multiple populations originating from GC-like subsystems, whereas that of the metal-rich component would have been produced by the X-shaped structure. Our results support previous studies suggesting the composite nature of the Milky Way bulge.

<title>Detection Rate of Galaxy Cluster-lensed Stellar Binary Black Hole Mergers by the Third-generation Gravitational-wave Detectors</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Gravitational waves (GWs) from stellar binary black hole (sBBH) mergers can be strongly gravitational lensed by intervening galaxies/galaxy clusters. Only a few works have investigated cluster-lensed sBBH mergers by adopting oversimplified models, while galaxy-lensed ones have been intensively studied. In this paper, we estimate the detection rate of cluster-lensed sBBH mergers with third-generation GW detectors and its dependence on the lens models. We adopt detailed modeling of galaxy cluster lenses by using the mock clusters in the Synthetic Sky Catalog for Dark Energy Science with LSST (cosmoDC2) and/or approximations of the pseudo-Jaffe profile or an eccentric Navarro–Frenk–White dark matter halo plus a bright central galaxy with singular isothermal sphere profile. Considering that the formation of sBBH mergers is dominated by the evolution of the massive binary star (EMBS) channel, we find that the detection rate of cluster-lensed sBBHs is ∼5–84 yr−1, depending on the adopted lens model and uncertainty in the merger rate density, which is about yr−1 if adopting relatively more realistic galaxy clusters with central main and member galaxies in the cosmoDC2 catalog, close to the estimated detection rate of sBBH mergers lensed by galaxies. In addition, we also consider the case in which the production of sBBH mergers is dominated by the dynamical interactions in dense stellar systems. We find that the detection rate of cluster-lensed sBBHs from the dynamical channel is about 1.5 times larger than that from the EMBS channel, and the redshift distribution of the former peaks at a higher redshift (∼3) compared with that from the latter (∼2).

<title>Simulations of the Collision between a Debris Stream and an Outer Dusty Torus: A Possible Channel for Forming a Fast-rise and Long-delay Radio Outburst in Tidal Disruption Events</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8ba5</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8ba5</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A geometrically thick dusty torus structure is believed to exist in the nuclear regions of galaxies (especially in active galactic nuclei). The debris stream from a tidal disruption event (TDE) will possibly collide with the dusty torus and produce a transient flare. We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to model the dynamical evolution of the interaction between unbound debris and a dusty torus. During the continuous interaction, shocked material will be spilled out from the interaction region and form an outflow. We calculate the temporal evolution of synchrotron emission by assuming that the shock accelerates a fraction of electrons in the outflow into a nonthermal distribution. We find that radio emission from the debris–torus collision generates a steep-rise and slow-decline radio light curve due to the sharp edge and dense gas of the dusty torus, where the radio outburst is delayed relative to the main optical/X-ray outburst by several years or even several tens of years. We apply our model to a TDE that happened in a narrow-line Seyfert I galaxy (PS16dtm), where both the radio spectrum and the light curve can be roughly reproduced. Future high-sensitivity, wide-field-of-view radio surveys have the opportunity to detect more such radio flares.

<title>Dynamics Around Supermassive Black Holes: Extreme-mass-ratio Inspirals as Gravitational-wave Sources</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Supermassive black holes and their surrounding dense stellar environments nourish a variety of astrophysical phenomena. We focus on the distribution of stellar-mass black holes around the supermassive black hole and the consequent formation of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). We derive a steady-state distribution, considering the effects of two-body scattering and gravitational-wave emission, and calculate the EMRI formation rate, eccentricity distribution, and EMRI-to-plunge ratio. Our model predicts: (a) a stronger segregation than previously estimated at the outskirts of the sphere of influence (at ∼0.01–2 pc for a Milky Way–like galaxy); (b) an increased EMRI-to-plunge ratio, favoring EMRIs at galaxies where stellar-mass black holes are scarce; (c) a detection of about 2 × 103 resolvable EMRIs, with a signal-to-noise ratio above 20, along a 4 yr LISA mission time; and (d) a confusion noise, induced by a cosmological population of unresolved EMRIs, reducing the LISA sensitivity in the 1–5 mHz frequency range by up to a factor of ≈2, relative to the instrumental noise.

<title>Post-Keplerian Perturbations of the Hyperbolic Motion in the Field of a Rotating Massive Object: Analysis in Terms of Osculating and Nonosculating (Contact) Elements</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the general relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense–Thirring components of the gravitational field of a rotating massive body are analytically worked out to the first post-Newtonian level in terms of the osculating Keplerian orbital elements. To the Newtonian order, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as well. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation in space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the primary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied to ‘Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system along an unbound heliocentric orbit, and to the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous spacecraft during its flyby of the Earth. The calculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any alternative models of gravity as well.

<title>Search for High-excitation Emission Lines from a Quasar-scale Active Nucleus in Arp 220</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The late-stage galaxy merger and prototypical ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) Arp 220 is probed using the JWST Mid Infrared Instrument medium-resolution spectrometer to search for multiple diagnostic active galactic nuclei (AGN) emission lines in the low-interstellar-opacity spectral ranges of 5.3–7.9 μm and 12.9–16.0 μm. We detect none of the characteristic high-excitation AGN emission lines. The most diagnostic nondetections are of the [Ne vi] λ 7.652 μm and [Ne v] λ 14.32 μm lines, for which the combined upper limit is ∼10–20 times fainter than the equivalent limit from Spitzer data. We also use X-ray measurements of the reflected Fe Kα line to suggest a relatively low X-ray luminosity. These results suggest that the high obscuration observed along the line of sight to the nuclei of Arp 220 is isotropic and keeps any high-excitation emission from a putative AGN from escaping. An implication is that the observed mid-infrared output of the nuclei is essentially their bolometric luminosity, i.e., no significant additional energy escapes. We utilize this result to show that any embedded AGNs are accreting at no more than ∼5% of the Eddington rate, lower than many theoretical predictions for this stage of ULIRG evolution.

<title>Viscous Transonic Accretion Flows in Kerr Black Hole Geometry</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad84dd</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study viscous transonic accretion flows in vertical equilibrium in Kerr geometry. We employ the pseudo-Kerr formalism that accurately describes transonic flows around Kerr black holes and is applicable for modeling observational data. We study the effects of viscosity on the nature of sonic points and the parameter space that allows an accretion flow to possess multiple sonic points. We concentrate on the accretion solutions that can have centrifugal pressure supported shock waves and find that the shocks are weaker and are located farther from the black hole as the viscosity is enhanced. Moreover, if the viscosity is greater than a critical value, shocks do not form and the accretion flow can pass only through the inner sonic point close to the black hole and remains subsonic and Keplerian throughout the accretion disk. Since the resonance oscillation frequencies of the shock waves provide a measure of the observed quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) frequencies, and since the location of shock waves depend on the spin of a black hole, it is clear that the QPO frequencies must depend on the spin of black hole as well. Our pseudo-Kerr approach makes it easier to compute spectra from an accretion flow with viscous dissipation and radiative cooling around a spinning black hole.

<title>Volatile Element Depletion of Carbonaceous Chondrites—Insights from Mass-dependent Zinc, Cadmium, and Tellurium Isotope Variations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad87ed</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad87ed</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The origin of volatile depletion in the solar system remains a topic of intense debate. To further inform our understanding of the mechanisms involved, this study characterized the mass-dependent Zn, Cd, and Te isotope compositions and concentrations of a comprehensive suite of carbonaceous chondrites (CCs). In accord with previous studies, Zn and Te display covariations between light isotope enrichments and elemental depletions. Observed here for the first time, Cd shows a similar trend. These correlations are consistent with the interpretation that the primary volatile element budgets of CCs were established by mixing of a volatile-rich CI-like matrix and a volatile-depleted non-matrix endmember (NME) in the solar nebula. All three elements display minor isotopic variations in CI and CM chondrites, as a consequence of aqueous alteration at low temperatures. In contrast, Cd and Te isotope compositions and concentrations are highly variable in CV and CO (Cd) and CK chondrites (Te). This reflects mobilization of the elements during thermal metamorphism at distinct redox conditions. The data of this study show that the NME has Zn, Cd, and Te concentrations that are depleted to an identical level of 0.12 ± 0.03 × CI chondrites, and it is characterized by mass-dependent isotope compositions for all three elements that are fractionated to light isotope values relative to CIs by a similar extent. In conjunction with literature data, this suggests that the concentrations and isotope compositions of NME volatiles record the same depletion processes, and that the NME volatile inventory is likely hosted predominantly in chondrules.

<title>Signature of Vertical Mixing in Hydrogen-dominated Exoplanet Atmospheres</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Vertical mixing is a crucial disequilibrium process in exoplanet atmospheres, significantly impacting chemical abundance and observed spectra. While current state-of-the-art observations have detected its signatures, the effect of vertical mixing on atmospheric spectra varies widely based on planetary parameters. In this study, we explore the influence of disequilibrium chemistry across a parameter space that includes eddy diffusion, surface gravity, internal and equilibrium temperature, and metallicity. We also assess the effectiveness of retrieval models in constraining the eddy diffusion coefficient. By running numerous 1D chemical kinetics models, we investigate the impact of vertical mixing on the transmission spectrum. We also built a custom fast-forward disequilibrium model, which includes vertical mixing using the quenching approximation and calculates the model abundance orders of magnitude faster than the chemical kinetics model. We coupled this forward model with an open-source atmospheric retrieval code, used it on the JWST simulated output data of our chemical kinetics model, and retrieved eddy diffusion coefficient, internal temperature, and atmospheric metallicity. We find that there is a narrow region in the parameter space in which vertical mixing has a large effect on the atmospheric transmission spectrum. In this region of the parameter space, the retrieval model can put high constraints on the transport strength and provide optimal exoplanets to study vertical mixing. In addition, the NH3 abundance can be used to constrain the internal temperature for equilibrium temperature Tequi > 1400 K.

<title>MAGAZ3NE: Massive, Extremely Dusty Galaxies at z ∼ 2 Lead to Photometric Overestimation of Number Densities of the Most Massive Galaxies at 3 < z < 4*</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present rest-frame optical spectra from Keck/MOSFIRE and Keck/NIRES of 16 candidate ultramassive galaxies targeted as part of the Massive Ancient Galaxies at z > 3 Near-Infrared Survey (MAGAZ3NE). These candidates were selected to have photometric redshifts 3 ≲ zphot <4, photometric stellar masses > 11.7, and well-sampled photometric spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the UltraVISTA and VIDEO surveys. In contrast to previous spectroscopic observations of blue star-forming and poststarburst ultramassive galaxies, candidates in this sample have very red SEDs implying significant dust attenuation, old stellar ages, and/or active galactic nuclei (AGN). Of these galaxies, eight are revealed to be heavily dust-obscured 2.0 < z < 2.7 galaxies with strong emission lines, some showing broad features indicative of AGN, three are Type I AGN hosts at z > 3, one is a z ∼ 1.2 dusty galaxy, and four galaxies do not have a confirmed spectroscopic redshift. In fact, none of the sample has ∣zspec − zphot∣ < 0.5, suggesting difficulties for photometric redshift programs in fitting similarly red SEDs. The prevalence of these red interloper galaxies suggests that the number densities of high-mass galaxies are overestimated at z ≳ 3 in large photometric surveys, helping to resolve the “impossibly early galaxy problem” and leading to much better agreement with cosmological galaxy simulations. A more complete spectroscopic survey of ultramassive galaxies is required to pin down the uncertainties on their number densities in the early Universe.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have developed a new method of multiwavelength data combination for the search of late-type radio dwarfs, and have put it into practice using GLEAM-X DR1 data. The initial sample is selected by cross-matching the Gaia/DR3 objects with the probability of being a star no less than 99%, and removing the extragalactic objects assigned by the SIMBAD database. The late-type dwarf stars are judged according to their location in the (BP − RP)0/MG color–magnitude diagram and in the (J − H)0/(K − W1)0 near-infrared color–color diagram. Furthermore, stellar activity is searched by ultraviolet excess in the GALEX/NUV band and the Rossby number in the TESS light curves. In total, 12 stars are found to be late-type dwarf stars associated with radio source, which consists of five stars with UV excess and seven stars with a Rossby number less than 0.13. Three of these 12 stars are previously studied to be associated with radio objects. All these 12 stars are considered to be reliable counterparts of radio sources.

<title>zoomies: A Tool to Infer Stellar Age from Vertical Action in Gaia Data</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Stellar age measurements are fundamental to understanding a wide range of astronomical processes, including Galactic dynamics, stellar evolution, and planetary system formation. However, extracting age information from main-sequence stars is complicated, with techniques often relying on age proxies in the absence of direct measurements. The Gaia data releases have enabled detailed studies of the dynamical properties of stars within the Milky Way, offering new opportunities to understand the relationship between stellar age and dynamics. In this study, we leverage high-precision astrometric data from Gaia DR3 to construct a stellar age prediction model based only on stellar dynamical properties, namely the vertical action. We calibrate two distinct, hierarchical stellar age–vertical action relations, first employing asteroseismic ages for red-giant-branch stars, then isochrone ages for main-sequence turn-off stars. We describe a framework called zoomies based on this calibration, by which we can infer ages for any star given its vertical action. This tool is open-source and intended for community use. We compare dynamical age estimates from zoomies with age measurements from open clusters and asteroseismology. We use zoomies to generate and compare dynamical age estimates for stars from the Kepler, K2, and TESS exoplanet transit surveys. While dynamical age relations are associated with large uncertainty, they are generally mass independent and depend on homogeneously measured astrometric data. These age predictions are uniquely useful for large-scale demographic investigations, especially in disentangling the relationship between planet occurrence, metallicity, and age for low-mass stars.

<title>Multiphase Gas Nature in the Sub-parsec Region of the Active Galactic Nuclei. III. Eddington Ratio Dependence on the Structures of Dusty and Dust-free Outflows</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b42</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b42</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigated the influence of the Eddington ratio on sub-parsec-scale outflows in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with supermassive black holes (SMBHs) masses of 107 M⊙ using two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations. When the range of the Eddington ratio is γEdd > 10−3, the radiation force exceeds the gas pressure, leading to stronger outflows and larger dust sublimation radius. Although the sub-parsec-scale outflows are a time-dependent phenomenon, our simulations demonstrated that the radial distributions can be well explained by the steady solutions of the spherically symmetric stellar winds. The dynamic structure of sub-parsec-scale outflows is influenced by the dust sublimation radius and the critical radii determined by the dynamical equilibrium condition. Although significantly affecting the outflow velocity, the Eddington ratio exerts minimal effects on temperature and number density distribution. Furthermore, our analytical solutions highlight the importance of the dust sublimation scale as a crucial determinant of terminal velocity and column density in dusty outflows. Through comparisons of our numerical model with the obscuring fraction observed in nearby AGNs, we reveal insights into the Eddington ratio dependence and the tendency toward the large obscuring fraction of the dusty and dust-free gases. The analytical solutions are expected to facilitate an understanding of the dynamical structure and radiation structures along the line of sight and their viewing angles from observations of ionized outflows.

We investigated the pulsating behavior of KIC 10855535 using Kepler 4 yr long-cadence data. Two independent frequencies were detected: a pulsation frequency F0 = 17.733260(5) day−1 and a low frequency f8 = 0.412643(8) day−1. We identify F0 as the fundamental frequency, at which an equidistant quintuplet is centered, suggesting that the star orbits in a binary system. The fitted orbital parameters align well with those reported in previous literature. Long-term phase modulation caused by binarity has been confirmed by considering the light curve from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. By removing the light-time effect, we measured a linear change in period of order , a value that could be indicative of stellar evolution. The star also exhibits a gradual and stable amplitude growth, thereby raising the possibility of structural changes during its evolution. We attributed f8 and its two harmonics to rotation and surface spots, with further analysis suggesting characteristics evolving over time. Based on this hypothesis, KIC 10855535 may rotate slowly for its type, with a speed of 37(2) km s−1. Overall, KIC 10855535 presents an exceptionally clean spectrum and a relatively slow rotation as a δ Sct pulsator, exhibiting a single pulsation mode that undergoes both amplitude and phase modulation.

<title>Ionized Carbon in Galaxies: The [C ii] 158 μm Line as a Total Molecular Gas Mass Tracer Revisited</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8c3e</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8c3e</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this paper, we present a statistical study of the [C ii] 158 μm line and the CO(1−0) emission for a sample of ∼200 local and high-z (32 sources with z > 1) galaxies with very different physical conditions. We explore the correlation between the luminosities of [C ii] and CO(1−0) lines and obtain a strong linear relationship, confirming that [C ii] is able to trace total molecular gas mass, with a small difference between (U)LIRGs and less-luminous galaxies. The tight and linear relation between [C ii] and CO(1−0) is likely determined by the average value of the observed visual extinction AV and the range of G0/n in galaxies. Further investigations into the dependence of L[C ii]/LCO(1−0) on different physical properties show that L[C ii]/LCO(1−0) (1) anticorrelates with ΣIR, and the correlation becomes steeper when ΣIR ≳ 1011L⊙ kpc−2; (2) correlates positively with the distance from the main sequence Δ(MS) when Δ(MS) ≲ 0; and (3) tends to show a systematically smaller value in systems where the [C ii] emission is dominated by ionized gas. Our results imply that caution needs to be taken when applying a constant [C ii]-to-Mmol conversion factor to estimate the molecular gas content in extreme cases, such as galaxies having low-level star formation activity or high star formation rate surface density.

<title>Detection of Diffuse Hot Gas around the Young, Potential Superstar Cluster H72.97–69.39</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8c41</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8c41</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the first Chandra X-ray observations of H72.97–69.39, a highly embedded, potential superstar cluster in its infancy located in the star-forming complex N79 of the Large Magellanic Cloud. We detect particularly hard, diffuse X-ray emission that is coincident with the young stellar objects identified with JWST, and the hot gas fills cavities in the dense gas mapped by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The X-ray spectra are best fit with either a thermal plasma or power-law model, and assuming the former, we show that the X-ray luminosity of LX = (1.0 ± 0.3) × 1034 erg s−1 is a factor of ∼20 below the expectation for a fully confined wind bubble. Our results suggest that stellar wind feedback produces diffuse hot gas in the earliest stages of massive star cluster formation and that wind energy can be lost quickly via either turbulent mixing followed by radiative cooling or by physical leakage.

<title>Absolute Dimensions of the Interferometric Binary HD 174881: A Test of Stellar Evolution Models for Evolved Stars</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8dcc</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report high-resolution spectroscopic monitoring and long-baseline interferometric observations with the Palomar Testbed Interferometer (PTI) of the 215 day binary system HD 174881 (K1 II-III), composed of two giant stars. The system is spatially resolved with the PTI, as well as in archival measurements with the CHARA Array. Our analysis of these observations, along with an analysis of the spectral energy distribution, have allowed us to infer accurate values for the absolute masses ( and ), radii (34.0 ± 1.3 and 22.7 ± 1.8 R☉), effective temperatures (4620 ± 100 and 4880 ± 150 K), and bolometric luminosities of both components, as well as other properties including the orbital parallax (distance). These provide valuable tests of stellar evolution models for evolved stars, which are still relatively uncommon compared to the situation for main-sequence stars. We find generally good agreement of all of these properties of HD 174881 with two sets of recent models (MIST and PARSEC) at compositions near solar, for ages of 255–273 Myr. We also find evidence of an infrared excess, based largely on the flux measurements from IRAS at 60 and 100 μm.

<title>Neutrino Detection Rates from Lepto-hadronic Model Simulations of Bright Blazar Flares</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8dce</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8dce</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
There is mounting evidence that blazars are the sources of part of the very-high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux detected by IceCube. In particular, there have been several spatial and temporal coincidences of individual IceCube neutrino events with flaring blazars, the most prominent of them being IceCube-170922A, coincident with a multiwavelength flare of TXS 0506+056. Motivated by this, we used the time-dependent lepto-hadronic code OneHaLe to model the spectral energy distributions and light curves of a sample of bright γ-ray flares of blazars detected by Fermi-Large Area Telescope, for which Kreter et al. provided calorimetric estimates of the expected neutrino detection rates. Flares were modeled with temporal changes of the proton injection spectra. Our analysis shows that the calorimetric approach overestimates the increase in neutrino production by a factor of typically ∼10 if the γ-ray emission is dominated by proton-synchrotron radiation.

<title>Astrophysical Properties of the Sirius Binary System Modeled with MESA</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8dd6</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky and, despite its proximity, this binary system still imposes intriguing questions about its current characteristics and past evolution. H. E. Bond et al. published decades of astronometric measurements of the Sirius system, determining the dynamical masses for Sirius A and B, and the orbital period. We have used these determinations, combined with photometric determinations for luminosity and spectroscopic determinations of effective temperature (Teff) and metallicity, to model the evolution of the Sirius system using Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics. We have constructed a model grid calculated especially for this system and were able to obtain, for Sirius B, a progenitor mass of 6.0 ± 0.6 M⊙, yielding a white dwarf mass of 1.015 ± 0.189 M⊙. Our best determination for the age of the system is 203.6 ± 45 Myr with a metallicity of 0.0124. We have compared our best-fit models with the ones computed using TYCHO, YREC, and PARSEC, establishing external uncertainties. Our results are consistent with the observations and support a noninteracting past.

<title>Strong Coupling of Hydrodynamics and Reactions in Nuclear Statistical Equilibrium for Modeling Convection in Massive Stars</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8a66</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8a66</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We build on the simplified spectral deferred corrections (SDC) coupling of hydrodynamics and reactions to handle the case of nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE) and electron/positron captures/decays in the cores of massive stars. Our approach blends a traditional reaction network on the grid with a tabulated NSE state from a very large, nuclei network. We demonstrate how to achieve second-order accuracy in the simplified-SDC framework when coupling NSE to hydrodynamics, with the ability to evolve the star on the hydrodynamics time step. We discuss the application of this method to convection in massive stars leading up to core collapse. We also show how to initialize the initial convective state from a 1D model in a self-consistent fashion. All of these developments are done in the publicly available Castro simulation code and the entire simulation methodology is fully GPU-accelerated.

<title>Investigating the Potential of LS 5039 as a Triple System Using Fermi-LAT Data</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad7bb6</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad7bb6</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
LS 5039 is one of a handful of γ-ray binary systems in the milky Way, comprising a pulsar and a massive O-type companion star with an orbital period of 3.9 days. Recently, we conducted a data analysis using approximately 16 yr of Fermi Large Area Telescope observations, spanning from 2008 August 4 to 2024 July 8. In our timing analysis, we discovered two new periodic signals with frequencies higher and lower than the known orbital period. The higher-frequency signal has a period of 3.63819 days with a 7.1σ confidence level, while the lower-frequency signal has a period of 4.21654 days with a 6.3σ confidence level. Additionally, in data from the High Energy Stereoscopic System of Cherenkov telescopes, two potential signals are found with periods similar to the two newly discovered ones. Considering that these two signals fall within the same frequency interval as the orbital period, we suggest the possibility of a third body orbiting the barycenter of the LS 5039 binary system, with the new periodic signals arising from specific frequency combinations of the two orbital periods.

<title>Radial Evolution of Non-Maxwellian Electron Populations Derived from Quasi-thermal Noise Spectroscopy: Parker Solar Probe Observations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Understanding the transport of energy within space plasmas, particularly in the solar wind, remains a complex challenge. Accurate measurement of electron temperatures and their nonthermal characteristics is crucial for comprehending energy transport properties in plasmas. Quasi-thermal-noise (QTN) spectroscopy has emerged as a dependable tool for precise electron parameters assessment as it is less susceptible to spacecraft effects than particle detectors. In this study, we apply a QTN spectroscopy fitting method to analyze data from the Parker Solar Probe FIELDS radio instrument obtained during Encounters 2 through 13, under unbiased antenna conditions. We use the kappa function to characterize the electron velocity distribution and employ a fitting technique to derive the changes in each parameter across heliocentric distances ranging from 12 Rs to 76 Rs. Specifically, we find that the electron density scales as ne ∝ r−2.09±0.04 and the Te ∝ r−0.65±0.02. The distribution of the kappa index has three distinct regions as a function of radial distance from the Sun. Furthermore, we conduct a statistical analysis of solar wind energy flux which we finds follows a power-law relationship wtotal ∝ r−1.92±0.04.

<title>Characterizing the Broadband Reflection Spectrum of MAXI J1803-298 during Its 2021 Outburst with NuSTAR and NICER</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad82e9</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad82e9</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
MAXI J1803-298 is a transient black hole candidate discovered in 2021 May during an outburst that lasted several months. Multiple X-ray observations reveal recurring “dipping” intervals in several of its light curves, particularly during the hard/intermediate states, with a typical recurrence period of ∼7 hr. We report analysis of four NuSTAR observations of the source, supplemented with NICER data where available, over the duration of the outburst evolution covering the hard, intermediate, and the soft states. Reflection spectroscopy reveals the black hole to be rapidly spinning (a* = 0.990 ± 0.001) with a near edge-on viewing angle (i = 70° ± 1°). Additionally, we show that the light-curve dips are caused by photoelectric absorption from a moderately ionized absorber whose origin is not fully understood, although it is likely linked to material from the companion star impacting the outer edges of the accretion disk. We further detect absorption lines in some of the spectra, potentially associated with Fe xxv and Fe xxvi, indicative of disk winds with moderate to extreme velocities. During the intermediate state and just before transitioning into the soft state, the source showed a sudden flux increase, which we found to be dominated by soft disk photons and consistent with the filling of the inner accretion disk, at the onset of state transition. In the soft state, we show that models of disk self-irradiation provide a better fit and a preferred explanation to the broadband reflection spectrum, consistent with previous studies of other accreting sources.

<title>Evolution of Cataclysmic Variables with Binary-driven Mass Loss during Nova Eruptions</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8880</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8880</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The discrepancies between observations and theoretical predictions of cataclysmic variables (CVs) suggest that there exists unknown angular-momentum-loss mechanism(s) besides magnetic braking and gravitational radiation. Mass loss due to nova eruptions belongs to the most likely candidates. While standard theory assumes that mass is lost in the form of radiation-driven, optically thick wind (fast wind), recent numerical simulations indicate that most of the mass loss is initiated and shaped by binary interaction. We explore the effect of this binary-driven mass loss (BDML) on the CV evolutions assuming a major fraction of the lost mass leaves the system from the outer Lagrangian point. Different from the traditional continuous wind picture, we consider the mass loss process to be instantaneous because the duration of nova eruptions is much shorter than the binary evolutionary timescale. Our detailed binary evolution calculations reveal the following results. (1) BDML seems able to provide extra angular momentum loss below the period gap. The mass transfer rates at a given orbital period occupy a large range, in agreement with the observed secular mass transfer rate distribution in CVs. (2) The enhanced mass transfer rates do not lead to a runaway mass transfer process and allow the white dwarfs to grow mass ≲0.1 M☉. (3) BDML can cause both positive and negative variations in the orbital period induced by nova eruptions, in line with observations, and can potentially explain the properties of some peculiar supersoft X-ray sources likely CAL 87, 1E 0035.4−7230, and RX J0537.7−7034.

<title>The JCMT BISTRO Survey: The Magnetic Fields of the IC 348 Star-forming Region</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad88ed</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad88ed</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present 850 μm polarization observations of the IC 348 star-forming region in the Perseus molecular cloud as part of the B-fields In STar-forming Region Observation survey. We study the magnetic properties of two cores (HH 211 MMS and IC 348 MMS) and a filamentary structure of IC 348. We find that the overall field tends to be more perpendicular than parallel to the filamentary structure of the region. The polarization fraction decreases with intensity, and we estimate the trend by power law and the mean of the Rice distribution fittings. The power indices for the cores are much smaller than 1, indicative of possible grain growth to micron size in the cores. We also measure the magnetic field strengths of the two cores and the filamentary area separately by applying the Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi method and its alternative version for compressed medium. The estimated mass-to-flux ratios are 0.45–2.20 and 0.63–2.76 for HH 211 MMS and IC 348 MMS, respectively, while the ratios for the filament are 0.33–1.50. This result may suggest that the transition from subcritical to supercritical conditions occurs at the core scale (∼0.05 pc) in the region. In addition, we study the energy balance of the cores and find that the relative strength of turbulence to the magnetic field tends to be stronger for IC 348 MMS than for HH 211 MMS. The result could potentially explain the different configurations inside the two cores: a single protostellar system in HH 211 MMS and multiple protostars in IC 348 MMS.

<title>BD+44°493: Chemo-dynamical Analysis and Constraints on Companion Planetary Masses from WIYN/NEID Spectroscopy*</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8646</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this work, we present high-resolution (R ∼ 100,000), high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ∼ 800) spectroscopic observations for the well-known, bright, extremely metal-poor, carbon-enhanced star BD+44°493. We determined chemical abundances and upper limits for 17 elements from WIYN/NEID data, complemented with 11 abundances redetermined from Subaru and Hubble data, using the new, more accurate, stellar atmospheric parameters calculated in this work. Our analysis suggests that BD+44°493 is a low-mass (0.83 M⊙), old (12.1–13.2 Gyr) second-generation star likely formed from a gas cloud enriched by a single metal-free 20.5 M⊙ Population III star in the early Universe. With a disk-like orbit, BD+44°493 does not appear to be associated with any major merger event in the early history of the Milky Way. From the precision radial-velocity NEID measurements (median absolute deviation = 16 m s−1), we were able to constrain companion planetary masses around BD+44°493 and rule out the presence of planets as small as MJ out to periods of 100 days. This study opens a new avenue of exploration for the intersection between stellar archaeology and exoplanet science using NEID.

<title>Multiwavelength Emission from Jets and Magnetically Arrested Disks in Nearby Radio Galaxies: Application to M87</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad88f4</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Radio galaxies are a subclass of active galactic nuclei that drive relativistic jets from their center and are observed in radio to very-high-energy gamma rays. The emission mechanisms and regions are still unknown. High-energy gamma rays can be explained by the emission from the magnetically arrested disks (MADs) around the central supermassive black hole (BH), for which the magnetic flux threading the BH is in a saturation level, although the emission from the MADs does not explain the optical and X-ray data. We construct a two-zone multiwavelength emission model in which optical and X-rays come from jets, while millimeter/submillimeter and gamma rays come from MADs. Our model takes into account the particle injection by the magnetic reconnection at the jet base close to the BH and particle entrainment from the ambient gas at the jet emission zone. We apply our model to M87 and find that our model can explain the simultaneous multiwavelength data, except for the radio data, which could be explained if we extend our one-zone emission model to a one-dimensional one. We also find that the strong plasma entrainment is necessary to explain the multiwavelength data. Our model will be tested by variability analysis among the multiwavelength data.

<title>Constraining the Location of the γ-Ray Emission Region in Radio-loud AGN 3C 380</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad891e</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad891e</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A detailed broadband spectral and temporal study of a radio-loud active galactic nucleus, 3C 380, is carried out using 14.5 yr of Fermi-LAT data, available Swift observations, and data from other observatories, including AstroSat (2020 August). The source exhibited a GeV outburst on 2020 September 5. Given the sparsity of Swift observations, no useful correlations could be established between γ-ray, X-ray, and UV/optical bands. The source is also a part of the Monitoring of Jets in Active Galactic Nuclei with VLBA Experiments survey and has been monitored at 15 GHz for over a decade. The correlation studies show that radio emission lags γ-rays by ∼150 days. We constrain the location of γ-ray emission by the core shift measurements from the literature and the observed time delays. Using this localization, we constructed and modeled the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of the source during its high γ-ray activity states and for the long-term averaged state. The SEDs during the high γ-ray activity states are modeled with two zones: one corresponding to the “steady” or the emission from the source averaged over more than a decade and another corresponding to the “flare” emission. We conclude that the high-energy emission originates within the parsec-scale jet, and moving shocks in the region drive the observed γ-flux variations.

<title>Observations of Preferential Heating and Acceleration of α-particles in the Young Solar Wind by Parker Solar Probe</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Remote sensing observations of the nascent solar wind in the solar corona imply that heavy ions are often faster and hotter than the plasma protons. In situ observations of the near-Earth solar wind with low collisional age show that hotter and faster states of heavy ions usually do not occur at the same time: heavy ions are either faster or hotter than the protons. This discrepancy highlights the need to understand the competing effects of heating, acceleration, Coulomb collisions, and instabilities on heavy ions in the inner heliosphere, from the solar corona to Earth. The Parker Solar Probe (PSP) is currently the closest spacecraft to the Sun and is anticipated to cross the outer boundary of the preferential heating and acceleration zone. Using in situ measurements from PSP, we find that larger drift speeds between α-particles and protons (Vαp) correspond to larger α-to-proton temperature ratios ( ) in the young solar wind close to the corona. This observation differs from in situ observations farther from the Sun (e.g., with Helios and Wind at 0.3–1 au). We believe that this difference is related to the speed of the solar wind, as well as the distance from the Sun. The anti-correlation between Vαp and in fast wind away from the Sun is potentially related to the energy transfer from the drift kinetic energy of α-particles to proton thermal energy due to drift instabilities. In the young slow wind, heavy ions exhibit signs of both preferential heating and preferential acceleration, but are not affected much by drift instabilities. We identify the outer boundary of the preferential heating and acceleration zone for heavy ions in the young slow wind to be at a distance of around 0.16 au, beyond which the effects of Coulomb collisions weaken the effects of preferential heating and acceleration.

<title>Transition Region Brightening in a Moss Region and Their Relation with Lower Atmospheric Dynamics</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Small-scale brightenings (SBs) are commonly observed in the transition region (TR) that separates the solar chromosphere from the corona. These brightenings, omnipresent in active region patches known as “moss” regions, could potentially contribute to the heating of active region plasma. In this study, we investigate the properties of SB events in a moss region and their associated chromospheric dynamics, which could provide insights into the underlying generation mechanisms of the SBs. We analyzed the data sets obtained by coordinated observations using the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph and the Goode Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory. We studied 131 SB events in our region of interest and found that 100 showed spatial and temporal matches with the dynamics observed in the chromospheric Hα images. Among these SBs, 98 of them were associated with spicules that are observed in Hα images. Furthermore, detailed analysis revealed that one intense SB event corresponded to an Ellerman bomb (EB), while another SB event consisted of several recurring brightenings caused by a stream of falling plasma. We observed that Hα far wings often showed flashes of strong brightening caused by the falling plasma, creating an Hα spectral profile similar to an EB. However, 31 of the 131 investigated SB events showed no noticeable spatial and temporal matches with any apparent features in Hα images. Our analysis indicated that the predominant TR SB events in moss regions are associated with chromospheric phenomena primarily caused by spicules. Most of these spicules display properties akin to dynamic fibrils.

We use a neural network model and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of HCN and HNC to constrain the physical conditions, most notably the cosmic-ray ionization rate (CRIR, ζ), in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the starburst galaxy NGC 253. Using output from the chemical code UCLCHEM, we train a neural network model to emulate UCLCHEM and derive HCN and HNC molecular abundances from a given set of physical conditions. We combine the neural network with radiative transfer modeling to generate modeled integrated intensities, which we compare to measurements of HCN and HNC from the ALMA Large Program ALCHEMI. Using a Bayesian nested sampling framework, we constrain the CRIR, molecular gas volume and column densities, kinetic temperature, and beam-filling factor across NGC 253's CMZ. The neural network model successfully recovers UCLCHEM molecular abundances with ∼3% error and, when used with our Bayesian inference algorithm, increases the parameter-inference speed tenfold. We create images of these physical parameters across NGC 253's CMZ at 50 pc resolution and find that the CRIR, in addition to the other gas parameters, is spatially variable with ζ ∼ a few ×10−14 s−1 at r ≳ 100 pc from the nucleus, increasing to ζ > 10−13 s−1 at its center. These inferred CRIRs are consistent within 1 dex with theoretical predictions based on nonthermal emission. Additionally, the high CRIRs estimated in NGC 253's CMZ can be explained by the large number of cosmic-ray-producing sources as well as a potential suppression of cosmic-ray diffusion near their injection sites.

<title>Turbulent Pressure Heats Gas and Suppresses Star Formation in Galactic Bar Molecular Clouds</title>

The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way is fed by gas inflows from the Galactic disk along almost radial trajectories aligned with the major axis of the Galactic bar. However, despite being fundamental to all processes in the nucleus of the Galaxy, these inflows have been studied significantly less than the CMZ itself. We present observations of various molecular lines between 215 and 230 GHz for 20 clouds with ∣ℓ∣ < 10°, which are candidates for clouds in the Galactic bar due to their warm temperatures and broad lines relative to typical Galactic disk clouds, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Atacama Compact Array. We measure gas temperatures, shocks, star formation rates, turbulent Mach numbers, and masses for these clouds. Although some clouds may be in the Galactic disk despite their atypical properties, nine clouds are likely associated with regions in the Galactic bar, and in these clouds, turbulent pressure is suppressing star formation. In clouds with no detected star formation, turbulence is the dominant heating mechanism, whereas photoelectric processes heat the star-forming clouds. We find that the ammonia (NH3) and formaldehyde (H2CO) temperatures probe different gas components, and in general, each transition appears to trace different molecular gas phases within the clouds. We also measure the CO-to-H2 X-factor in the bar to be an order of magnitude lower than the typical Galactic value. These observations provide evidence that molecular clouds achieve CMZ-like properties before reaching the CMZ.

<title>GOALS-JWST: The Warm Molecular Outflows of the Merging Starburst Galaxy NGC 3256</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad87d3</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad87d3</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) integral-field spectrograph observations of NGC 3256, a local infrared-luminous late-stage merging system with two nuclei roughly 1 kpc apart, both of which have evidence of cold molecular outflows. Using JWST/NIRSpec and Mid-Infrared Instrument data sets, we investigate this morphologically complex system on spatial scales of <100 pc, where we focus on the warm molecular H2 gas surrounding the nuclei. We detect collimated outflowing warm H2 gas originating from the southern nucleus, though we do not find significant outflowing H2 gas surrounding the northern nucleus. We measure maximum intrinsic outflow velocities of ∼1000 km s−1, which extend out to a distance of 0.7 kpc. Based on H2 S(7)/S(1) ratios, we find a larger fraction of warmer gas near the southern nucleus, which decreases with increasing distance from the nucleus, signifying the southern nucleus as a primary source of H2 heating. The gas mass of the warm H2 outflow component is estimated to be Mwarm,out = (1.4 ± 0.2) × 106M⊙, as much as 6% of the cold H2 mass estimated using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array CO data. The outflow timescale is about 7 × 105 yr, resulting in a mass outflow rate and kinetic power Pwarm,out ∼ 4 × 1041 erg s−1. Lastly, regions within our 3.″0 × 3.″0 NIRSpec data, where the outflowing gas reside show high [Fe ii]/Paβ and H2/Brγ line ratios, indicate enhanced mechanical heating caused by the outflows. The fluxes and ratios of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in these regions are not significantly different compared to those elsewhere in the disk, suggesting the outflows may not significantly alter the PAH ionization state or grain size.

<title>A Buddy for Betelgeuse: Binarity as the Origin of the Long Secondary Period in α Orionis</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad87f4</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad87f4</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We predict the existence of α Ori B, a low-mass companion orbiting Betelgeuse. This is motivated by the presence of a 2170 day long secondary period (LSP) in Betelgeuse’s lightcurve, a periodicity that is ≈5 times longer than the star’s 416 day fundamental radial pulsation mode. While binarity is currently the leading hypothesis for LSPs in general, the LSP and the radial velocity (RV) variations observed in Betelgeuse, taken together, necessitate a revision of the prevailing physical picture. Specifically, the lightcurve–RV phase difference requires a companion to be behind Betelgeuse at the LSP luminosity minimum, ≈180° out of phase with the system orientation associated with occultation. We demonstrate the consistency of this model with available observational constraints and identify tensions in all other proposed LSP hypotheses. Within this framework, we calculate a mass for α Ori B of and an orbital separation of 1850 ± 70 R⊙, or times the radius of Betelgeuse. We then describe the features of the companion as constrained by the fundamental parameters of Betelgeuse and its orbital system, and discuss what would be required to confirm the companion’s existence observationally.

<title>Sun-as-a-Star Spectral Line Variability in the 300–2390 nm Wavelength Range</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Combining the near-daily Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) measurements of solar spectra, we construct line indices (line-core to line-flanks ratios) for various transitions (mainly Fe i) in the 300–2390 nm spectral domain. The indices are supplemented by the wavelength-binned fluxes from OMI and Total and Spectral Solar Irradiance Sensor (TSIS-1). To study the short-term (solar-rotational) patterns, we normalize the indices and fluxes to the minimum-activity epoch, then de-trend them with 81 day running means. Comparisons of the de-trended TSIS-1 and OMI fluxes with the NASA-NOAA-LASP SSI (NNLSSI1) model show excellent agreement, to (0.5–2.2) × 10−4 in the normalized and de-trended data. The data are subjected to a multiregression analysis against quantities representing the facular brightening and the sunspot darkening. The de-trended line indices and average fluxes show different sensitivities to these two solar magnetic-activity manifestations, with the fluxes being far more susceptible to the sunspot component. The de-trended line indices experience a rapid drop of activity levels towards longer wavelengths, albeit with a large rebound in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) domain that is caused by the ubiquitous, temperature-sensitive CO transitions. The wavelength-dependent activity also falls, however much slower, in the de-trended average fluxes. Qualitatively similar behavior is captured by semiempirical models.

<title>Constraints on Common Envelope Ejection from Double Helium White Dwarfs</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad88ef</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad88ef</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Double helium white dwarfs (He WDs) are a type of gravitational wave source and are greatly important in studies of binary interaction, particularly in common envelope (CE) ejection physics. Most double He WDs with mass ratios of q ∼ 1 are formed through a particular channel. In this channel, one He WD is initially produced from a red giant (RG) with a degenerate core via stable Roche lobe overflow, and another He WD is formed from an RG with a degenerate core via CE ejection. They may have significant implications for binary evolution processes but have not received specific studies, especially for the CE phase. This paper adopts a semianalytic method and a detailed stellar evolution simulation to model the formation of double He WDs. We find that most double He WDs show mass ratios slightly greater than 1, and their orbital period–mass ratio relations are broadly consistent with observations. There is also a relation between the mass ratios and progenitor masses of the He WDs produced via CE ejection for double He WDs with determined WD masses. Based on this relation, the mass of the He WD progenitor can be inferred from the mass ratio. Then, the CE ejection efficiency can be constrained with the orbital period. In addition, we constrain the CE ejection efficiency for two double He WDs, J1005-2249 and WD0957-666. The results show that the CE ejection efficiencies increase with the WD progenitor masses.

<title>Identifying New High-confidence Polluted White Dwarf Candidates Using Gaia XP Spectra and Self-organizing Maps</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The identification of new white dwarfs (WDs) polluted with heavy elements is important since they provide a valuable tool for inferring the chemical properties of putative planetary systems accreting material on their surfaces. The Gaia space mission has provided us with an unprecedented amount of astrometric, photometric, and low-resolution (XP) spectroscopic data for millions of newly discovered stellar sources, among them thousands of WDs. In order to find WDs among these data and to identify which ones have metals in their atmospheres, we propose a methodology based on an unsupervised artificial intelligence technique called self-organizing maps. In our approach, a nonlinear high-dimensional data set is projected on a 2D grid map where similar elements fall into the same neuron. By applying this method, we obtained a clean sample of 66,337 WDs. We performed an automatic spectral classification analysis on them, obtaining 143 bona fide polluted WD candidates not previously classified in the literature. The majority of them are cool WDs and we identify in their XP spectra several metallic lines such as Ca, Mg, Na, Li, and K. The fact that we obtain similar precision metrics to those achieved with recent supervised techniques highlights the power of our unsupervised approach to mine the Gaia archives for hidden treasures to follow up spectroscopically with higher resolution.

<title>Mass Function of Stellar Black Holes as Revealed by the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA Observations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Ninety gravitational-wave events have been detected by the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA network and are released in the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog. Among these events, 83 cases are definitely binary black hole mergers, since the masses of all the objects involved significantly exceed the upper limit of neutron stars. The black holes in these merger events naturally form two interesting samples, a premerger sample that includes all the black holes before the mergers and a postmerger sample that consists of the black holes generated during the merging processes. The former represents black holes that once existed in the Universe, while the latter represents newly born black holes. Here we present a statistical analysis of these two samples. The nonparametric τ statistic method is adopted to correct for the observational selection effect. The Lynden-Bell C− method is further applied to derive the mass distribution and density function of black holes. It is found that the mass distribution can be expressed as a broken power-law function. More interestingly, the power-law index in the high-mass region is comparable for the two samples. The number density of black holes is found to depend on redshift as ρ(z) ∝ z−2.06—z−2.12 based on the two samples. The implications of these findings on the origin of black holes are discussed.

<title>Estimating the Masses of Supercluster-scale Filaments from Redshift Dispersions</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8ba8</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a strategy for estimating the mass per unit length along supercluster-scale filaments that are oriented across the sky, based on mock redshift surveys of 264 filaments from the Millennium simulation. In our fiducial scenario, we place each simulated filament at a distance of 300 Mpc, perpendicular to the line of sight, and calculate the redshift dispersion using galaxies with magnitudes r < 19.5. Some regions are dynamically complicated in ways that interfere with finding a simple relationship between dispersion σ and linear mass density μ. However, by examining individual overlapping segments along the filaments, we find a relationship that allows us to successfully predict from with a scatter of about ±0.20 dex, for ∼70% of the regions along filaments. This relationship is robust to changes in the distance to the filament if the physical segment length and the absolute magnitude for galaxy selection are held constant. The relationship between redshift dispersion and mass is similar to that obtained for a simple analytical model where filaments are dynamically relaxed, and we examine the possibility that the galaxies are indeed relaxed within the gravitational potential of the filament. We find that this is not the case; galaxy dynamics are strongly affected by infall to the filament and by orbits within groups and clusters.

<title>Efficient and Accurate Force Replay in Cosmological-baryonic Simulations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We construct time-evolving gravitational potential models for a Milky Way–mass galaxy from the FIRE-2 suite of cosmological-baryonic simulations using basis function expansions. These models capture the angular variation with spherical harmonics for the halo and azimuthal harmonics for the disk, and the radial or meridional plane variation with splines. We fit low-order expansions (four angular/harmonic terms) to the galaxy’s potential for each snapshot, spaced roughly 25 Myr apart, over the last 4 Gyr of its evolution, then extract the forces at discrete times and interpolate them between adjacent snapshots for forward orbit integration. Our method reconstructs the forces felt by simulation particles with high fidelity, with 95% of both stars and dark matter, outside of self-gravitating subhalos, exhibiting errors ≤4% in both the disk and the halo. Imposing symmetry on the model systematically increases these errors, particularly for disk particles, which show greater sensitivity to imposed symmetries. The majority of orbits recovered using the models exhibit positional errors ≤10% for 2–3 orbital periods, with higher errors for orbits that spend more time near the galactic center. Approximate integrals of motion are retrieved with high accuracy even with a larger potential sampling interval of 200 Myr. After 4 Gyr of integration, 43% and 70% of orbits have total energy and angular momentum errors within 10%, respectively. Consequently, there is higher reliability in orbital shape parameters such as pericenters and apocenters, with errors ∼10% even after multiple orbital periods. These techniques have diverse applications, including studying satellite disruption in cosmological contexts.

<title>Water Enrichment from Pebble Drift in Disks with Gap-forming Planets</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad891d</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad891d</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Volatiles like H2O are present as ice in solids in the cold outer regions of protoplanetary disks and as vapor in the warm inner regions within the water snow line. Icy pebbles drifting inwards from the outer disk sublimate after crossing the snow line, enriching the inner disk with solid mass and water vapor. Meanwhile, protoplanets forming within the disk open gaps in the disk gas, creating traps against the inward drift of pebbles and in turn reducing water enrichment in the inner disk. Recent disk observations from millimeter interferometry and infrared spectroscopy have supported this broad picture by finding a correlation between the outer radial distribution of pebbles and the properties of inner water vapor spectra. In this work, we aim at further informing previous and future observations by building on previous models to explore pebble drift in disks with multiple gaps. We systematically explore multiple gap locations and their depths (equivalent to the specific masses of planets forming within), and different particle sizes to study their impact on inner disk water enrichment. We find that the presence of close-in deep gaps carved by a Jupiter-mass planet is likely crucial for blocking icy pebble delivery into the inner disk, while planets with lower masses only provide leaky traps. We also find that disks with multiple gaps show lower vapor enrichment in the inner disk. Altogether, these model results support the idea that inner disk water delivery and planet formation are regulated by the mass and location of the most massive planets.

<title>Testable Predictions of Outside-in Age Gradients in Dwarf Galaxies of All Types</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We use a sample of 73 simulated satellite and central dwarf galaxies spanning a stellar mass range of 105.3–109.1M⊙ to investigate the origin of their stellar age gradients. We find that dwarf galaxies often form their stars “inside-out,” i.e., the stars form at successively larger radii over time. However, the oldest stars get reshuffled beyond the star-forming radius by fluctuations in the gravitational potential well caused by stellar feedback (the same mechanisms that cause dwarfs to form dark matter cores). The result is that many dwarfs appear to have an “outside-in” age gradient at z = 0, with younger stellar populations more centrally concentrated. However, for the reshuffled galaxies with the most extended star formation, young stars can form out to the large radii to which the old stars have been reshuffled, erasing the age gradient. We find that major mergers do not play a significant role in setting the age gradients of dwarfs. We find similar age gradient trends in satellites and field dwarfs, suggesting that environment plays only a minor role, if any. Finally, we find that the age gradient trends are imprinted on the galaxies at later times, suggesting that the stellar reshuffling dominates after the galaxies have formed 50% of their stellar mass. The later reshuffling is at odds with results from the fire-2 simulations. Hence, age gradients offer a test of current star formation and feedback models that can be probed via observations of resolved stellar populations.

<title>21cmlstm: A Fast Memory-based Emulator of the Global 21 cm Signal with Unprecedented Accuracy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Neural network (NN) emulators of the global 21 cm signal need an emulation error much less than the observational noise in order to be used to perform unbiased Bayesian parameter inference. To this end, we introduce 21cmLSTM—a long short-term memory (LSTM) NN emulator of the global 21 cm signal that leverages the intrinsic correlation between frequency channels to achieve exceptional accuracy compared to previous emulators, which are all feedforward, fully connected NNs. LSTM NNs are a type of recurrent NN designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. When trained and tested on the same simulated set of global 21 cm signals as the best previous emulators, 21cmLSTM has an average relative rms error of 0.22%—equivalently 0.39 mK—and comparably fast evaluation time. We perform seven-dimensional Bayesian parameter estimation analyses using 21cmLSTM to fit global 21 cm signal mock data with different adopted observational noise levels, σ21. The posterior 1σ rms error is ≈three times less than σ21 for each fit and consistently decreases for tighter noise levels, showing that 21cmLSTM can sufficiently exploit even very optimistic measurements of the global 21 cm signal. We have made the emulator, code, and data sets publicly available so that 21cmLSTM can be independently tested and used to retrain and constrain other 21 cm models.

<title>Evidence for a Close-in Tertiary Orbiting around the Algol-type System HZ Dra with Tidal Splitting and Spots Activities</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report a cyclic variation of the O − C diagram with a semiamplitude of 0.0033 days and a period of 1.05 yr for the pulsating eclipsing binary HZ Dra. The cyclic variation can be explained by the light travel-time effect via the presence of a close-in third body orbiting around HZ Dra in an elliptical orbit with a maximum semimajor axis of 0.89 au. Based on the Wilson–Devinney code, the contribution of the third light to the total system is determined to be 29.0%, which is in agreement with the estimated value. Our light-curve modeling indicates an evolving hot and cool spot on the surface of the primary and secondary components, respectively. Their positions are roughly symmetrical to the inner Lagrangian point L1, which could be used to explain the variation in the O'Connell effect. Our frequency analysis detects one radial p-mode, seven nonradial p-modes, and one nonradial g-mode. In addition, a total of six multiplets are identified, spaced by the orbital frequency, which can be explained as a tidally split mode caused by the equilibrium tides of the close binary system with a circular orbit. These pulsating features suggest that the primary of HZ Dra is a δ Scuti star, pulsating in both p- and g-mode and influenced by tidal forces.

Triple stellar systems allow us to study stellar processes that cannot be attained in binary stars. The evolutionary phases in which the stellar members undergo mass exchanges can alter the hierarchical layout of these systems. Yet, the lack of a self-consistent treatment of common-envelope (CE) in triple-star systems hinders the comprehensive understanding of their long-term fate. This paper examines the conditions predicted around binaries embedded within CEs using local 3D hydrodynamical simulations. We explore varying the initial binary separation, the flow Mach number, and the background stellar density gradients as informed by a wide array of CE conditions, including those invoked to explain the formation of the triple system hosting PSR J0337+1715. We find that the stellar density gradient governs the gaseous drag force, which determines the final configuration of the embedded binary. We observe a comparable net drag force on the center of mass but an overall reduction in the accretion rate of the binary compared to the single-object case. We find that, for most CE conditions, and in contrast to the uniform background density case, the binary orbital separation increases with time, softening the binary and preventing it from subsequently merging. We conclude that binaries spiraling within CEs become more vulnerable to disruption by tidal interactions. This can have profound implications on the final outcomes of triple-star systems.

<div> 关键词: Gyrochronology, 白矮星+主序星双星系统, 自转周期, 完全对流边界, 结构变化

总结:
Gyrochronology是用于确定低质量恒星年龄的有价值的工具，该研究基于针对宽广的白矮星+主序星双星系统的185个样本，并通过对MS星的旋转周期进行预测来验证了这一技术。研究表明，在完全对流边界附近，主序星的自转周期会出现高达三倍的增加，这是由于构造变化和该边界处发生的3He不稳定性所导致的。此外，由于当前的温度误差，无法将测得的自转周期唯一地与单个旋转轨道相对应，因此推测Gyrochronology可能对于非常接近完全对流边界的M型矮星并不可行。<br /><br /> <div>
Gyrochronology, a valuable tool for determining ages of low-mass stars where other techniques fail, relies on accurate calibration. We present a sample of 185 wide (>100 au) white dwarf + main sequence (WD + MS) binaries. Total ages of WDs are computed using all-sky survey photometry, Gaia parallaxes, and WD atmosphere models. Using a magnetic braking law calibrated against open clusters, along with assumptions about initial conditions and angular momentum transport, we construct gyrochrones to predict the rotation periods of MS stars. Both data and models show that, at the fully convective boundary (FCB), MS stars with WD ages of up to 7.5 Gyr and within a <50 K effective temperature range experience up to a threefold increase in rotation period relative to stars slightly cooler than the FCB. We suggest that rapid braking at this boundary is driven by a sharp rise in the convective overturn timescale (τcz) caused by structural changes between partially and fully convective stars and the 3He instability occurring at this boundary. While the specific location in mass (or temperature) of this feature varies with model physics, we argue that its existence remains consistent. Stars along this feature exhibit rotation periods that can be mapped, within 1σ, to a range of gyrochrones spanning ≈6 Gyr. Due to current temperature errors (≃50 K), this implies that a measured rotation period cannot be uniquely associated to a single gyrochrone, implying that gyrochronology may not be feasible for M dwarfs very close to the FCB.

<div> 瞬变天体、高红移、机器学习、超新星、光度

总结:
本文研究了一个高红移范围内瞬变天体的系统搜索，通过开发一个机器学习分类器，成功筛选出了14个高红移瞬变样本。这些样本包括两个Ibn型超新星候选体，它们的事件率在相似红移处Ib型超新星的事件率的1%以上，这表明在这个红移范围内有一部分大质量恒星在爆炸前喷发出富含He的包层。此外，两个样本的绝对光度与超亮超新星相当，事件率约为超亮超新星在z≈2时的10%-25%。 <div>
Recent high-cadence transient surveys have discovered rapid transients whose light-curve timescales are shorter than those of typical supernovae (SNe). In this paper, we present a systematic search for rapid transients at medium-high redshifts among 3381 SNe candidates obtained from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program transient survey. We developed a machine learning classifier to classify the SN candidates into four types (Type Ia, Ibc, II SNe and rapid transients) based on the features derived from the light curves. By applying this classifier to the 3381 SN candidates and by further applying the quality cut, we selected 14 rapid transient samples. They are located at a wide range of redshifts (0.34 ≤ z ≤ 1.85) and show a wide range of the peak absolute magnitude (−17 ≥ M ≥ −22). The event rate of the rapid transients is estimated to be ∼6 × 103 events yr−1 Gpc−3 at z ∼ 0.74, which corresponds to about 2% of the event rate of normal core-collapse SNe at a similar redshift. Based on the luminosity and color evolution, we selected two candidates of Type Ibn SNe at z ∼ 0.75. The event rate of Type Ibn SN candidates is more than 1% of Type Ib SN rate at the same redshift, suggesting that this fraction of massive stars at this redshift range eruptively ejects their He-rich envelope just before the explosions. Also, two objects at z = 1.37 and 1.85 show high luminosities comparable to superluminous SNe. Their event rate is about 10%–25% of superluminous SNe at z ∼ 2.

<div> 关键词: classical novae, observational constraints, optical peak, high-cadence observations, white dwarf<br />
<br />总结: 
本文报道了对快速新星V1674 Her的前所未有的观测，这些观测从其光学峰值以上10等开始，并包括高频率（2分钟）的观测，记录了在短短5小时内约8等的增长。我们识别出光变曲线中的两个明显断裂点，指出了从缓慢上升到迅速上升，然后再到更快、几乎线性上升的转变。观测深度使我们能够在白矮星以Eddington光度发射的黑体辐射的假设下紧密约束光球的大小。我们发现，在快速风爆发之前，白矮星不太可能已经溢出罗奇波，这对解释费米伽马射线的探测结果构成了挑战，因为这可能是快速风与伴星卸去的气体形成的慢环之间的相互作用。 Evryscope和计划中的Argus Array对新星进行高频率观测，可以记录新星光变曲线的多样性，并有助于解决热核聚变、双星相互作用和激震如何驱动它们最早的亮度。 <div>
Observational constraints on classical novae are heavily biased to phases near optical peak and later because of the simple fact that novae are not typically discovered until they become bright. The earliest phases of brightening, coming before discovery, are typically missed, but this is changing with the proliferation of wide-field optical monitoring systems including the Zwicky Transient Facility, All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, and Evryscope. Here, we report on unprecedented observations of the fast nova V1674 Her beginning >10 mag below its optical peak and including high-cadence (2 minutes) observations that chart a rise of ∼8 mag in just 5 hr. Two clear breaks are identified as the light curve transitions first from rising slowly to rising rapidly, followed by a transition to an even faster, nearly linear rate of increasing flux with time. The depths of the observations allow us to place tight constraints on the size of the photosphere under the assumption of blackbody emission from a white dwarf emitting at its Eddington luminosity. We find that the white dwarf was unlikely to have overflowed its Roche lobe prior to the launch of a fast wind, which poses a challenge for explaining the Fermi γ-ray detections as the interaction of a fast wind with a slow torus of gas stripped from the inflated white dwarf envelope by the companion. High-cadence observations of novae from Evryscope and the planned Argus Array can record the diversity of rising nova light curves and help resolve how the interplay between thermonuclear fusion, binary interaction, and shocks power their earliest light.

<div> 关键词: Omega Centauri, SGB stars, age estimates, age-metallicity relation, Hubble Space Telescope photometry<br />
总结: 通过对Omega Centauri中8100多颗次巨星分支星的年龄估计，研究其恒星形成历史。使用多波段的哈勃空间望远镜光度和MUSE金属丰度的大数据集，将每颗星的光度和金属丰度与具有ω Cen特定[C + N + O]–[Fe/H]关系的理论等时线进行拟合，得出大部分星的年龄在13至10亿年之间，平均恒星年龄为12.08亿年，年龄的中位数不确定性为0.68亿年。构建了迄今为止最完整的ω Cen的年龄–金属丰度关系，并发现恒星的平均年龄随金属丰度增加而降低，并在年龄–金属丰度平面上发现了两条不同的流，暗示不同的恒星形成途径。对整个星团的年龄固有分散为0.75亿年，年龄分散随金属丰度的增加而明显增加。通过改变等时线参数和约束系统偏差，验证了年龄估计的可靠性，发现C + N + O关系对约束年龄–金属丰度关系最为关键。此外，还提出了具有年龄信息的SGB染色体图。未来，可以将这些恒星年龄与化学丰度相结合，研究亚群体的年龄差异，并揭示这个庞大核星团的化学演化历史。 <div>
We present age estimates for over 8100 subgiant branch (SGB) stars in Omega Centauri (ω Cen) to study its star formation history. Our large data set, which combines multi-wavelength Hubble Space Telescope photometry with MUSE metallicities, provides an unprecedented opportunity to measure individual stellar ages. We do this by fitting each star’s photometry and metallicity with theoretical isochrones that are embedded with an empirical [C + N + O]–[Fe/H] relation specific to ω Cen. The bulk of the stars have ages between 13 and 10 Gyr, with the mean stellar age being 12.08 ± 0.01 Gyr and the median age uncertainty being 0.68 Gyr. From these ages we construct the most complete age–metallicity relation for ω Cen to date. We find that the mean age of stars decreases with increasing metallicity and find two distinct streams in the age–metallicity plane, hinting at different star formation pathways. We derive an intrinsic spread in the ages of 0.75 ± 0.01 Gyr for the whole cluster, with the age spread showing a clear increase with metallicity. We verify the robustness of our age estimations by varying isochrone parameters and constraining our systematics. We find the C + N + O relation to be the most critical consideration for constraining the age–metallicity relation. We also present an SGB chromosome map with age information. In the future these stellar ages could be combined with chemical abundances to study age differences in subpopulations and uncover the chemical evolution history of this massive nuclear star cluster.

<div> 短寿命放射性同位素、太阳系、星际介质、恒星、星际尘埃
<br /><br />太阳系中的短寿命放射性同位素在早期提供了行星体加热和干燥的能量。然而，太阳系相对于其他类似形成特征的行星系是否高度富集仍不清楚。目前观测中也很难确定个别原行星盘中的短寿命放射性同位素富集程度。研究利用N体模拟估算了星际区域中短寿命放射性同位素的富集情况，发现对于26Al富集，太阳系处于期望分布的上限，并且对于更依赖超新星的同位素60Fe，太阳系富集程度相对较高。这些结果表明26Al驱动的干燥过程在外行星的组成中的作用可能被低估了，而60Fe作为加热源的影响也被过度估计。 
<br />总结:太阳系相对于其他类似行星系是否高度富集仍不清楚。研究利用N体模拟估算了星际区域中短寿命放射性同位素的富集情况，发现对于26Al富集，太阳系处于期望分布的上限，并且对于更依赖超新星的同位素60Fe，太阳系富集程度相对较高。 这些结果表明短寿命同位素在外行星的组成中的作用可能被低估了，而60Fe作为加热源的影响也被过度估计。 <div>
Recent research provides compelling evidence that the decay of short-lived radioisotopes (SLRs), such as 26Al, provided the bulk of energy for heating and desiccation of volatile-rich planetesimals in the early solar system. However, it remains unclear whether the early solar system was highly enriched relative to other planetary systems with similar formation characteristics. While the solar system possesses an elevated level of SLR enrichment compared to the interstellar medium, determining SLR enrichment of individual protoplanetary disks observationally has not been performed and is markedly more difficult. We use N-body simulations to estimate enrichment of SLRs in star-forming regions through two likely important SLR sources: stellar winds from massive stars and supernovae (SNae). We vary the number of stars and the radii of the star-forming regions and implement two models of stellar-wind SLR propagation for the radioisotopes 26Al and 60Fe. We find that for 26Al enrichment the solar system is at the upper end of the expected distribution, while for the more SNae-dependent isotope 60Fe we find that the solar system is comparatively very highly enriched. Furthermore, combined with our previous research, these results suggest that the statistical role of 26Al-driven desiccation on exoplanet bulk composition may be underestimated in typical interpretations of the low-mass exoplanet census, and that 60Fe is even less influential as a source of heating than previously assumed.

总结：<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了利用色-星等图(CMDs)对星系的星族形成史进行精确测量的方法，探讨了在大数据时代利用机器学习网络的可行性。研究利用最新的理论恒星演化模型细化CMDs方法，引入卷积神经网络提高效率，并创新初始恒星质量估计方法。经过测试和验证，深度学习网络SFHNet能够准确测量星系的星族形成史，并提供了关于恒星密度分布、初始恒星质量和星族形成速率的详细洞察。深度学习网络的应用不仅提高了方法的效率和灵活性，还为对附近星系的全面和深入理解提供了帮助。 <div>
Reproducing color–magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of star-resolved galaxies is one of the most precise methods for measuring the star formation history (SFH) of nearby galaxies back to the earliest time. The upcoming big data era poses challenges to the traditional numerical technique in its capacity to deal with vast amounts of data, which motivates us to explore the feasibility of employing machine learning networks in this field. In this study, we refine the synthetic CMD method with a state-of-the-art theoretical stellar evolution model to simulate the properties of stellar populations, incorporate the convolutional neural network in the fitting process to enhance the efficiency, and innovate the initial stellar mass estimation to improve the flexibility. The fine-tuned deep learning network, named SFHNet, has been tested with synthetic data and further validated with photometric data collected from the Hubble Space Telescope. The derived SFHs are largely in accordance with those reported in the literature. Furthermore, the network provides detailed insights into the distribution of stellar density, initial stellar mass, and star formation rate over the age–metallicity map. The application of the deep learning network not only measures the SFH accurately but also enhances the synthetic CMD method’s efficiency and flexibility, thereby facilitating a more comprehensive and in-depth understanding of nearby galaxies.

<div> 超亮X射线脉冲星; 超Eddington吸积; 广义相对论辐射磁流体力学模拟; 磁化中子星; 磁场结构

总结:
超亮X射线脉冲星（ULXP）是由超Eddington吸积在磁化中子星上引起的，其详细的磁场结构和吸流-出流过程还不太清楚。作者使用广义相对论辐射磁流体力学（GR-RMHD）模拟了超Eddington吸积流在磁化中子星上的行为。他们发现在磁屏蔽半径以外形成一个吸积盘和光学厚的出流，而在磁屏蔽半径以内则出现了与磁场线对齐的吸流。磁屏蔽半径处，当偶极磁场比四极磁场突出时，形成了靠近磁极的吸积柱，而四极磁场强度超过偶极磁场则形成了类似于贴近赤道的吸积带。磁化中子星的自转是通过吸积气体的角动量转换为电磁场的角动量而实现的。即使在一个磁极附近形成了吸积柱，观测到的亮度在有吸积柱和没有吸积柱的一侧几乎相同，这是因为辐射能量通过散射向两侧传输。根据作者的模型，银河系的ULXP Swift J0243.6+6124具有2×10^13 G的四极磁场和不到4×10^12 G的偶极磁场。 <div>
Although ultraluminous X-ray pulsars (ULXPs) are believed to be powered by super-Eddington accretion onto a magnetized neutron star (NS), the detailed structures of the inflow–outflow and magnetic fields are still not well understood. We perform general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics (GR-RMHD) simulations of super-Eddington accretion flows onto a magnetized NS with dipole and/or quadrupole magnetic fields. Our results show that an accretion disk and optically thick outflows form outside the magnetospheric radius, while inflows aligned with magnetic field lines appear inside. When the dipole field is more prominent than the quadrupole field at the magnetospheric radius, accretion columns form near the magnetic poles, whereas a quadrupole magnetic field stronger than the dipole field results in the formation of a belt-like accretion flow near the equatorial plane. The NS spins up as the angular momentum of the accreting gas is converted into the angular momentum of the electromagnetic field, which then flows into the NS. Even if an accretion column forms near one of the magnetic poles, the observed luminosity is almost the same on both the side with the accretion column and the side without it, because the radiation energy is transported to both sides through scattering. Our model suggests that galactic ULXP Swift J0243.6+6124 has a quadrupole magnetic field of 2 × 1013 G and a dipole magnetic field of less than 4 × 1012 G.

<title>Extreme-mass-ratio Inspirals in the Strong Segregation Regime—to Inspiral or to Get Ejected?</title>

<br />
这项研究针对低频引力波探测器的主要目标之一——恒星质量黑洞的极端质量比螺旋（EMRIs）进行了研究。研究发现，当黑洞在中心渐进的轨道受到引力波辐射的影响时，强烈的质量分离可能导致螺旋形成率大幅下降，甚至降低一个数量级。这项研究揭示了在星系核内形成EMRI所需的强碰撞的重要性。 
<br /><br />总结: 
EMRIs和BHs是低频引力波探测器的主要目标。强质量分离可能会导致EMRI形成率下降。研究发现强碰撞对EMRI的形成非常重要。 <div>
Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) are among the main targets for upcoming low-frequency gravitational wave (GW) detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. In the classical scenario, EMRIs are formed when BHs scatter off each other and are driven onto highly eccentric orbits that gradually inspiral due to GW emission. If the cluster is in a state of strong mass segregation, the BHs are expected to reside in a steep cusp around the central massive black hole (MBH), which would facilitate more efficient EMRI formation. However, strong mass segregation may also lead to an increased rate of ejections due to close encounters between the BHs. Here, we test the relevance of such ejections for EMRI formation by numerically solving a two-dimensional Fokker–Planck equation. Our formalism includes the effects of two-body relaxation, GW dissipation, and ejections. We find that the EMRI formation rate can be suppressed due to ejections by more than an order of magnitude for strongly segregated BH cusps with density index γ ≳ 2.25 around central MBHs of mass M• ≲ 106 M⊙. The EMRI formation rate levels off up to a maximum value of ≃200 Gyr−1 due to ejections, which is roughly an order of magnitude lower than the usual scenarios ignoring ejections for steep BH cusps around low-mass MBHs. Our analysis reveals the significance of strong scatterings for EMRI formation in galactic nuclei.

总结: 
本文研究了磁活跃的巨星HD 251108，发现其具有稳定的21.3天旋转周期以及持续的长期光变化，这可通过恒稳的恒星斑点来解释。研究还跟踪了一次超耀斑的衰减阶段，观测到了未曾有的日冕温度成分细节。超耀斑的峰值通量约为10^34 erg s−1 (0.5–4.0 keV)，在早期衰减阶段呈指数级下降，是迄今观测到的最强烈的一次。超耀斑的发射过程与较小耀斑样本中已建立的趋势一致，证明了超耀斑发射的物理过程在较大范围的能量内保持一致。研究估计了耀斑环的长度约为恒星半径的2-4倍，并未观测到耀斑期间的丰度变化。<br /><br /> <div>
Many giant stars are magnetically active, which causes rotational variability, chromospheric emission lines, and X-ray emission. Large outbursts in these emission features can set limits on the magnetic field strength and thus constrain the mechanism of the underlying dynamo. HD 251108 is a Li-rich active K-type giant. We find a rotational period of 21.3 days with color changes and additional long-term photometric variability. Both can be explained with very stable stellar spots. We followed the decay phase of a superflare for 28 days with NICER and from the ground. We track the flare decay in unprecedented detail in several coronal temperature components. With a peak flux around 1034 erg s−1 (0.5–4.0 keV) and an exponential decay time of 2.2 days in the early decay phase, this is one of the strongest flares ever observed, yet it follows trends established from samples of smaller flares, for example, for the relations between Hα and X-ray flux, indicating that the physical process that powers the flare emission is consistent over a large range of flare energies. We estimate a flare loop length about 2–4 times the stellar radius. No evidence is seen for abundance changes during the flare.

Electron degradation serves as a significant energy source in planetary upper atmospheres. In this study, a Monte Carlo model is constructed to investigate the degradation of electrons in a pure O2 atmosphere under the local approximation. Both elastic and inelastic collision processes between electrons and O2 molecules are considered in the model. The yield spectra, characterizing the occurrence of various inelastic collisions for a specified pair of incident and post-collision energies, are obtained from the model. When combined with the information of e-O2 collision cross sections, the yields of each inelastic process are then determined. Furthermore, we derive the mean energy per ion pair and the efficiencies of various inelastic processes, along with the yields of secondary (and higher-order) electrons. The calculations presented here are beneficial for understanding the ionization and heating budgets in planetary atmospheres containing a significant amount of O2 such as Earth and Jovian icy satellites (Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto).

总结:<br />
这篇论文对2023年3月7日的太阳火山口喷发进行了多波段和多视角观测，采用修订的锥体模型首次对火山口进行了约4小时的三维重建和跟踪。结果显示火山口的传播不是径向的，在活跃区NOAA 13243的大尺度日冕环路周围进行了偏转运动。火山口的真实速度估计约为829 km/s，比CME核心（火山口）的速度快1.2倍。研究得出提取的修订锥体模型可以重现爆发性火山口早期生命中的加速和偏转。 <div>
In this paper, we carry out multiwavelength and multiview observations of the prominence eruption, which generated a C2.3 class flare and a coronal mass ejection (CME) on 2023 March 7. For the first time, we apply the revised cone model to three-dimensional reconstruction and tracking of the eruptive prominence for ∼4 hr. The prominence propagates nonradially and makes a detour around the large-scale coronal loops in active region NOAA 13243. The northward deflection angle increases from ∼36° to ∼47° before returning to ∼36° and keeping up. There is no longitudinal deflection throughout the propagation. The angular width of the cone increases from ∼30° and reaches a plateau at ∼37°. The heliocentric distance of the prominence rises from ∼1.1 to ∼10.0 R☉, and the prominence experiences continuous acceleration (∼51 m s−2) over 2 hr, which is probably related to the magnetic reconnection during the C-class flare. The true speed of the CME front is estimated to be ∼829 km s−1, which is ∼1.2 times larger than that of the CME core (prominence). We conclude that both acceleration and deflection of eruptive prominences in their early lives could be reproduced with the revised cone model.

<div> 关键词: SNe Ibn, X射线, 质量流失率, 比邻恒星, 数值模型 <br />
总结: <br />本文报告了对SNe Ibn型超新星SN 2022ablq的多波段观测结果，特别是X射线观测结果。研究发现该超新星在X射线波段比传统的SN Ibn型超新星更明亮，推测其质量流失率在爆炸前0.5-2年达到峰值，而稳态恒星风不太可能是主要的质量流失机制。此外，研究还搜索了爆发性事件的前体辐射，但未发现与其他SNe Ibn类似的显著信号。最后，数值模型表明15太阳质量的氦星在爆发性事件后约1.8年爆炸，与观测到的辐射光变曲线一致。因此，观测结果不支持Wolf–Rayet恒星通过恒星风失去富含He物质的假设，而更加支持包括与紧密双星伴侣发生Roche溢流或在核合成晚期阶段发生爆发性事件的低质量祖恒星模型。 <div>
Type Ibn supernovae (SNe Ibn) are rare stellar explosions powered primarily by interaction between the SN ejecta and H-poor, He-rich material lost by their progenitor stars. Multiwavelength observations, particularly in the X-rays, of SNe Ibn constrain their poorly understood progenitor channels and mass-loss mechanisms. Here we present Swift X-ray, ultraviolet, and ground-based optical observations of the Type Ibn SN 2022ablq, only the second SN Ibn with X-ray detections to date. While similar to the prototypical Type Ibn SN 2006jc in the optical, SN 2022ablq is roughly an order of magnitude more luminous in the X-rays, reaching unabsorbed luminosities LX ∼ 4 × 1040 erg s−1 between 0.2–10 keV. From these X-ray observations we infer time-varying mass-loss rates between 0.05 and 0.5 M⊙ yr−1 peaking 0.5–2 yr before explosion. This complex mass-loss history and circumstellar environment disfavor steady-state winds as the primary progenitor mass-loss mechanism. We also search for precursor emission from alternative mass-loss mechanisms, such as eruptive outbursts, in forced photometry during the 2 yr before explosion. We find no statistically significant detections brighter than M ≈ −14—too shallow to rule out precursor events similar to those observed for other SNe Ibn. Finally, numerical models of the explosion of an ∼15 M⊙ helium star that undergoes an eruptive outburst ≈1.8 yr before explosion are consistent with the observed bolometric light curve. We conclude that our observations disfavor a Wolf–Rayet star progenitor losing He-rich material via stellar winds and instead favor lower-mass progenitor models, including Roche-lobe overflow in helium stars with compact binary companions or stars that undergo eruptive outbursts during late-stage nucleosynthesis stages.

总结:<br /><br />这篇论文介绍了脉动星的重要性以及更新了Stellingwerf的脉动模型代码，采用了最新的辐射不透明度表。结果显示，辐射不透明度的更新对脉动特性的影响不大，在周期、不稳定性带边界位置和光度曲线形状方面只有轻微变化。因此，脉动星作为标准烛光和恒星群的追踪者的理论校准基本不受影响。然而，辐射不透明度表一致性的实现是迈向一个统一和自洽的恒星演化和脉动框架的重要一步。 <div>
Pulsating stars are universally recognized as precise distance indicators and tracers of stellar populations. Their variability, combined with well-defined relationships between pulsation properties and intrinsic evolutionary parameters such as luminosity, mass, and age, makes them essential for understanding galactic evolution and retrieving star formation histories. Therefore, accurate modeling of pulsating stars is crucial for using them as standard candles and stellar population tracers. This is the first paper in the “Stellar Pulsation and Evolution: a Combined Theoretical Renewal and Updated Models” project, which aims to present an update of Stellingwerf’s hydrodynamical pulsation code, by adopting the latest radiative opacity tables commonly used in stellar evolution community. We assess the impact of this update on pulsation properties, such as periods, instability strip topology, and light-curve shapes, as well as on period–Wesenheit and period–luminosity relations for Classical Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars, comparing the results with those derived using older opacity data. Our results indicate that the opacity update introduces only minor changes: instability strip boundary locations shift by no more than 100 K in effective temperature, and pulsation periods vary within 1σ compared to previous evaluations. Light curves exhibit slight differences in shape and amplitude. Consequently, the theoretical calibration of the Cepheid- or RRL-based extragalactic distance scale remains largely unaffected by the opacity changes. However, achieving consistency in opacity tables between stellar evolution and pulsation codes is a significant step toward a homogeneous and self-consistent stellar evolution and pulsation framework.

<div> ALMA, protoplanetary disks, molecular line observations, cold molecular chemistry, CRI rate  
总结:
ALMA观测了三星T Tauri盘GG Tau A的冷分子化学，发现N2H+和DCO+的发射。通过模型比较和观测结果，发现冷分子化学对CRI率最敏感，但对星际紫外光通量和C/O比的影响较小。最佳模型需要一个较低的CRI率，但无法解释N2H+和DCO+的较低温度。 <div>
Resolved molecular line observations are essential for gaining insight into the physical and chemical structure of protoplanetary disks, particularly in cold, dense regions where planets form and acquire their chemical compositions. However, tracing these regions is challenging because most molecules freeze onto grain surfaces and are not observable in the gas phase. We investigated cold molecular chemistry in the triple stellar T Tauri disk GG Tau A, which harbours a massive gas and dust ring and an outer disk, using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 7 observations. We present high angular resolution maps of N2H+ and DCO+ emission, with upper limits reported for H2D+, 13CS, and SO2. The radial intensity profile of N2H+ shows most emission near the ring’s outer edge, while DCO+ exhibits a double peak, one near the ring’s inner edge and the other in the outer disk. With complementary observations of lower-lying transitions, we constrained the molecular surface densities and rotation temperatures. We compared the derived quantities with model predictions across different cosmic-ray ionization (CRI) rates, carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios, and stellar UV fluxes. Cold molecular chemistry, affecting the N2H+, DCO+, and H2D+ abundances, is most sensitive to the CRI rate, while the stellar UV fluxes and C/O ratios have minimal impact on these three ions. Our best model requires a low CRI rate of 10−18 s−1. However, it fails to match the low temperatures derived from N2H+ and DCO+, 12–16 K, which are much lower than the CO freezing temperature.

这篇论文使用Swift卫星的Burst Alert Telescope探测到的140个活动星系核（AGN）的Spitzer光谱数据进行分析。研究发现，高离子化的中红外辐射线（MIR）如[Ne v] 14.32, 24.32 μm 和 [O iv] 25.89 μm可以作为AGN活动的良好指标，并且不受遮挡影响。在AGN样本中，MIR冠状发射线的检测率很高（≳85%–90%），其亮度与14–150 keV光度呈强相关性，且与全天星等亮度也紧密相关。研究还发现MIR冠状发射线的强度与14–150 keV光度的关系与黑洞质量、AGN光度和Eddington比无关，且不受高X射线列密度影响，证实MIR冠状发射线可作为1042–1045 erg s−1范围内X射线光度的无偏跟踪器。<br /><br />总结: <br />AGN样本的Spitzer光谱数据显示，MIR冠状发射线可以作为AGN活动的可靠指标，且与X射线光度和全天星等亮度呈现出强相关性。此外，MIR冠状发射线的强度与X射线光度的关系不受其他因素的影响，因此可作为无偏跟踪器。 <div>
We analyze Spitzer spectra of 140 active galactic nuclei (AGN) detected in the hard X-rays (14–195 keV) by the Burst Alert Telescope on board Swift. This sample allows us to probe several orders of magnitude in black hole masses (106–109M⊙), Eddington ratios (10−3–1), X-ray luminosities (1042–1045 erg s−1), and X-ray column densities (1020–1024 cm−2). The AGN emission is expected to be the dominant source of ionizing photons with energies ≳50 eV, and therefore, high-ionization mid-infrared (MIR) emission lines such as [Ne v] 14.32, 24.32 μm and [O iv] 25.89 μm are predicted to be good proxies of AGN activity, and robust against obscuration effects. We find high detection rates (≳85%–90%) for the MIR coronal emission lines in our AGN sample. The luminosities of these lines are correlated with the 14–150 keV luminosity (with a typical scatter of σ ∼0.4–0.5 dex), strongly indicating that the MIR coronal line (CL) emission is driven by AGN activity. CLs are also tightly correlated to the bolometric luminosity (σ ∼0.2–0.3 dex), calculated from careful analysis of the spectral energy distribution. We find that the relationship between the CL strengths and L14–150 keV is independent of black hole mass, AGN luminosity, and Eddington ratio, and mostly not affected by high X-ray column densities. This confirms that the MIR CLs can be used as unbiased tracers of the AGN power for X-ray luminosities in the 1042–1045 erg s−1 range.

<div> Eri III, DELVE 1, spectroscopy, dwarf galaxies, chemical abundances
总结: 该研究对Eri III和DELVE 1进行了光谱学研究，确定了它们的成员星，并对其速度和金属丰度进行了限制。作者发现这两个天体的最亮恒星都具有极低的金属丰度，并且富含碳元素。由于它们的金属丰度远低于银河系球状星团的金属丰度，并且未曾在球状星团中发现这种类型的恒星，这可能表明Eri III和DELVE 1是矮星系。然而，它们的半光半径相较于已知的超微弱矮星系更为紧凑。研究者得出结论，Eri III和DELVE 1可能是迄今发现的最小的矮星系，或者它们代表了一类经历了与普通球状星团不同化学演化的新型恒星团。未来对更多恒星的碳和/或铁元素丰度以及两个系统的改善恒星运动学的测量结果将有助于进一步确定它们的性质。 <div>
We present spectroscopy of the ultra-faint Milky Way satellites Eridanus III (Eri III) and DELVE 1. We identify eight member stars in each satellite and place nonconstraining upper limits on their velocity and metallicity dispersions. The brightest star in each object is very metal poor, at [Fe/H] = −3.1 for Eri III and [Fe/H] = −2.8 for DELVE 1. Both of these stars exhibit large overabundances of carbon and very low abundances of the neutron-capture elements Ba and Sr, and we classify them as CEMP-no stars. Because their metallicities are well below those of the Milky Way globular cluster population, and because no CEMP-no stars have been identified in globular clusters, these chemical abundances could suggest that Eri III and DELVE 1 are dwarf galaxies. On the other hand, the two systems have half-light radii of 8 pc and 6 pc, respectively, which are more compact than any known ultra-faint dwarfs. We conclude that Eri III and DELVE 1 are either the smallest dwarf galaxies yet discovered, or they are representatives of a new class of star clusters that underwent chemical evolution distinct from that of ordinary globular clusters. In the latter scenario, such objects are likely the most primordial star clusters surviving today. These possibilities can be distinguished by future measurements of carbon and/or iron abundances for larger samples of stars or improved stellar kinematics for the two systems.

EK Draconis, a nearby young solar-type star (G1.5V, 50–120 Myr), is known as one of the best proxies for inferring the environmental conditions of the young Sun. The star frequently produces superflares, and Paper I presented the first evidence of an associated gigantic prominence eruption observed as a blueshifted Hα Balmer line emission. In this paper, we present the results of the dynamical modeling of the stellar eruption and examine its relationship to the surface starspots and large-scale magnetic fields observed concurrently with the event. By performing a 1D freefall dynamical model and a 1D hydrodynamic simulation of the flow along the expanding magnetic loop, we found that the prominence eruption likely occurred near the stellar limb (12 -16 degrees from the limb) and was ejected at an angle of -24 degrees relative to the line of sight, and the magnetic structures can expand into a coronal mass ejection. The observed prominence displayed a terminal velocity of ∼0 km s−1 prior to disappearance, complicating the interpretation of its dynamics in Paper I. The models in this paper suggest that prominence’s Hα intensity diminishes at around or before its expected maximum height, explaining the puzzling time evolution in observations. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite light curve modeling and (Zeeman) Doppler Imaging revealed large midlatitude spots with polarity inversion lines and one polar spot with dominant single polarity, all near the stellar limb during the eruption. This suggests that midlatitude spots could be the source of the gigantic prominence we reported in Paper I. These results provide valuable insights into the dynamic processes that likely influenced the environments of early Earth, Mars, Venus, and young exoplanets.

<title>Applying the Velocity Gradient Technique in NGC 1333: Comparison with Dust Polarization Observations</title>

总结: 本文使用了VGT技术研究星形成区域的磁场，并与不同波长的尘埃偏振观测结果进行比较。研究表明VGT在不同密度区域的适用性，通过分析分子线梯度推导出倾斜角和三维阿尔文马赫数。然而，研究结果显示出速度梯度推断的方向与尘埃推断的磁场方向并无密切关联。 <div>
Magnetic fields (B-fields) are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium (ISM), and they play an essential role in the formation of molecular clouds and subsequent star formation. However, B-fields in interstellar environments remain challenging to measure, and their properties typically need to be inferred from dust polarization observations over multiple physical scales. In this work, we seek to use a recently proposed approach called the velocity gradient technique (VGT) to study B-fields in star-forming regions and compare the results with dust polarization observations in different wavelengths. The VGT is based on the anisotropic properties of eddies in magnetized turbulence to derive B-field properties in the ISM. We investigate that this technique is synergistic with dust polarimetry when applied to a turbulent diffused medium for the purpose of measuring its magnetization. Specifically, we use the VGT on molecular line data toward the NGC 1333 star-forming region (12CO, 13CO, C18O, and N2H+), and we compare the derived B-field properties with those inferred from 214 and 850 μm dust polarization observations of the region using Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy/High-Resolution Airborne Wide-band Camera Plus and James Clerk Maxwell Telescope/POL-2, respectively. We estimate both the inclination angle and the 3D Alfvénic Mach number MA from the molecular line gradients. Crucially, testing this technique on gravitationally bound, dynamic, and turbulent regions, and comparing the results with those obtained from polarization observations at different wavelengths, such as the plane-of-sky field orientation, is an important test on the applicability of the VGT in various density regimes of the ISM. We in general do not find a close correlation between the velocity gradient inferred orientations and the dust inferred magnetic field orientations.

总结:<br />
本研究对银河系周围卫星星系的分布模式进行了探讨，通过构建“卫星分布生成器”代码生成了105个类似系统，并发现银河系周围卫星星系的c/a概率分布函数十分宽泛，并提出了新的评估方法。重新评估了银河系周围卫星星系的稀有性，并发现其仍然是罕见的。最后指出银河系周围卫星的轨道极和距离要比模拟的宿主-卫星系统更符合一个平面友好的分布，挑战了目前的结构和星系形成模型。 <div>
The majority of satellite galaxies around the Milky Way (MW) show disk-like distributions (the disk of satellites; DoS), which is a small-scale problem of the lambda cold dark matter cosmology. The conventional definition of the MW-like DoS is a satellite system with a minor-to-major axis ratio (c/a) lower than the MW’s c/a value of 0.181. Here, we question the validity of the c/a-based DoS rarity assessment and propose an alternative approach. How satellites are placed around a galaxy is dictated mainly by two factors: the distributions of the satellites’ orbital poles and their distances from the host. Based on this premise, we construct the “satellite distribution generator” code and generate 105 spatially and kinematically analogous systems (SKASs) sharing these two factors. The SKAS can disclose the intrinsic, underlying c/a probability distribution function (PDF), from which a present-day c/a value is fortuitously determined. We find that the c/a PDF of the MW DoS defined by 11 classical satellites is quite broad (σc/a ∼ 0.105), implying that a simple present-day c/a value, combined with its highly time-variable nature, cannot fully represent the degree of flatness. Moreover, based on the intrinsic c/a PDF, we reevaluate the rarity of the MW DoS by comparing it with Illustris TNG50-1 host–satellite systems and find that even with the new measure, the MW DoS remains rare (0.00%–3.40%). We show that the reason behind the rareness is that both orbital poles and distances of the 11 MW satellites are far more plane-friendly than those of simulated host–satellite systems, challenging the current structure and galaxy formation model.

总结: 
GRB 170817A是第一个通过引力波和电磁信号检测到的双中子星并合事件。研究重新评估了喷流参数，表明可能存在反喷流。但通过观测发现过剩流量与反喷流的关联性不足以证明这种假设。因此，需要结合多波段光变曲线和视觉运动来破解喷流的几何参数和微物理参数之间的不确定性。 <div>
GRB 170817A (also GW170817) became the first binary neutron star merger event detected via gravitational waves and electromagnetic signals. Over the next 4 yr, various multiband observations have led to reimaging of the various short gamma-ray burst and interstellar medium interaction models. While these models successfully explain the observed afterglow until ∼900 days, a rebrightening or excess flux was observed in the 1 keV X-ray band after ∼1000 days. In this study, we reevaluate the jet parameters using new observations (until ∼1234 days) with a boosted fireball jet model. We study the observable effects of the counterjet for GRB 170817A, using our new afterglow code, firefly. Our results show that it is indeed possible for the observed excess to coincide with the emissions from a counterjet (∼800 days). We also computed an empirical scaling law between the jet and counterjet peak emission timescales and the observer angle. The firefly code can also track the simulated object through the observer’s sky and numerically model the apparent motion. The calculated apparent motion (≈2.6c) does not match the observed apparent motion (5.2c−7.5c). Hence we conclude that the excess flux of GRB 170817A may not be associated with a counterjet; however, it is not enough to reject this hypothesis from the traditional counterjet visibility timescale, which predicts ≥5000 days. The apparent motion, combined with the multiband lightcurves, is needed to break the degeneracy between the geometrical parameters and the microphysical parameters of the afterglow.

We present a study of the abundance of calcium in the innermost disk of 70 T Tauri stars in the star-forming regions of Chamaeleon I, Lupus, and Orion OB1b. We use calcium as a proxy for the refractory material that reaches the inner disk. We used magnetospheric accretion models to analyze the Ca ii emission lines and estimate abundances in the accretion flows of the stars, which feed from the inner disks. We find Ca depletion in disks of all three star-forming regions, with 57% of the sample having [Ca/H] < –0.30 relative to the solar abundance. All disks with cavities and/or substructures show depletion, consistent with trapping of refractories in pressure bumps. Significant Ca depletion ([Ca/H] < –0.30) is also measured in 60% of full disks, although some of those disks may have hidden substructures or cavities. We find no correlation between Ca abundance and stellar or disk parameters except for the mass accretion rate onto the star. This could suggest that the inner and outer disks are decoupled, and that the mass accretion rate is related to a mass reservoir in the inner disk, while refractory depletion reflects phenomena in the outer disk related to the presence of structure and forming planets. Our results of refractory depletion and timescales for depletion are qualitatively consistent with expectations of dust growth and radial drift, including partitioning of elements, and constitute direct evidence that radial drift of solids locked in pebbles takes place in disks.

<div> 关键词: 硫化物，固体SO2，氢原子，冰幕，反应产物

总结:
实验和计算研究表明，固体SO2在低温下与氢原子反应，大约80%的固体SO2会在10-40 K时从基底蒸发，甚至在60 K时也会有大约50%蒸发。量子化学计算表明，氢原子更倾向于加到固体SO2的S原子上，形成HSO2自由基。进一步的反应会生成多种含硫物种，包括HS(O)OH，S(O)OH自由基，HO-S-OH，HS-OH和H2S。在H和SO2的共沉积实验中，确认了H2S，HS(O)OH和/或HO-S-OH的形成。然而，这些含硫物种的产量不足以解释初始SO2的完全消失，这表明一些产物会在形成后脱附到气相中。这项研究表明，冰幕中的一部分SO2可能保持未反应状态，避免氢化反应，而其余部分则转化为其他物种，其中一些可能会发生化学脱附。 <div>
Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a sulfur-containing molecule expected to exist as a solid in the interstellar medium. In this study, we have performed laboratory experiments and computational studies on the surface reactions of solid SO2 with hydrogen atoms on amorphous solid water (ASW) at low temperatures. After 40 minutes of exposure of SO2 deposited on ASW to H atoms, approximately 80% of the solid SO2 was lost from the substrate at 10–40 K, and approximately 50% even at 60 K, without any definite detection of reaction products. Quantum chemical calculations suggest that H atoms preferentially add to the S atom of solid SO2, forming the HSO2 radical. Further reactions of the HSO2 radical with H atoms result in the formation of several S-bearing species, including HS(O)OH, the S(O)OH radical, HO–S–OH, HS–OH, and H2S. In codeposition experiments involving H and SO2, we have confirmed the formation of H2S, HS(O)OH, and/or HO–S–OH. However, the yields of these S-bearing species are insufficient to account for the complete loss of the initial SO2 reactant. These findings suggest that some products are desorbed into the gas phase upon formation. This study indicates that a portion of the SO2 in ice mantles may remain unreacted, avoiding hydrogenation, while the remainder is converted into other species, some of which may be subject to chemical desorption.

本研究利用James Clerk Maxwell望远镜对红外暗云G16.96+0.27进行了850μm热尘极化观测，发现平均磁场方向与Planck 353 GHz数据的大尺度磁场方向大致垂直于细丝结构。通过Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi方法估计平面磁场强度约为96μG和60μG。对云团的维里参数和磁临界参数进行了计算，发现磁场和湍流均弱于重力，但磁场和湍流合力等于重力，表明G16.96+0.27处于准平衡状态。同时发现磁场与云团之间的对齐性在密集区域有逐渐从垂直向散列的趋势，可能是潜在碎片形成的迹象。 <div>
We present 850 μm thermal dust polarization observations with a resolution of 14.″4 (∼0.13 pc) toward an infrared dark cloud G16.96+0.27 using James Clerk Maxwell Telescope/POL-2. The average magnetic field orientation, which roughly agrees with the larger-scale magnetic field orientation traced by the Planck 353 GHz data, is approximately perpendicular to the filament structure. The estimated plane-of-sky magnetic field strength is ∼96 μG and ∼60 μG using two variants of the Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi methods. We calculate the virial and magnetic critical parameters to evaluate the relative importance of gravity, the magnetic field, and turbulence. The magnetic field and turbulence are both weaker than gravity, but magnetic fields and turbulence together are equal to gravity, suggesting that G16.96+0.27 is in a quasi-equilibrium state. The alignment between the magnetic field and cloud is found to have a trend moving away from perpendicularity in the dense regions, which may serve as a tracer of potential fragmentation in such quiescent filaments.

<title>Compact Binary Merger Rate with Modified Gravity in Dark Matter Spikes</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8917</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8917</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this study, we investigate the impact of modified gravity (MG) on the merger rate of compact binaries within dark matter spikes surrounding supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Specifically, we calculate the binary merger rates involving primordial black holes (PBHs) and/or neutron stars (NSs) in Hu–Sawicki f(R) gravity and the normal branch of Dvali–Gabadadze–Porrati (nDGP) gravity, with three SMBH mass functions: Benson, Vika, and Shankar. The results show consistently higher merger rates predicted for PBH–PBH and PBH–NS binaries in these gravity models compared to general relativity (GR), in particular at lower SMBH masses and for steeper dark matter spike density profiles. The predicted merger rates are compared to the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA observations in constraining the parameters of the theory. In particular, we find steeper dark matter spike density profiles in the MG scenarios compared to GR. When compared to current observational constraints on PBH abundance, the mass ranges allowed by Hu–Sawicki f(R) models are found to be wider than those allowed by nDGP models, for given merger rates. The results are highly dependent on the choice of SMBH mass function, with the Vika and Shankar mass functions predicting lower abundances. The considerable sensitivity of the results to the assumed gravity scenario and SMBH mass function demonstrates the necessity of incorporating the corresponding theoretical uncertainties when making relatively robust predictions on compact binary merger rates and, as a result, on PBH properties.

<title>Dark Photon Dark Matter and Low-frequency Gravitational-wave Detection with Gaia-like Astrometry</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Astrometric surveys offer us a method for searching for elusive cosmic signatures, such as ultralight dark photon dark matter and gravitational waves (GWs), by observing the temporal change of stars’ apparent locations. The detection capabilities of such surveys rapidly decrease at low frequencies, because the signals become hardly distinguishable from the background motion of stars. In this work, we find that the background motion can be well described by a linear model over time, based on which we propose a linear background subtraction scheme. Compared to the conventional quadratic subtraction, the advantage of linear subtraction emerges within the frequency range below 6 × 10−9 Hz. Taking dark photons with purely gravitational interactions, dark photons with additional U(1)B or U(1)B−L gauge interactions, and low-frequency GWs as examples, we illustrate that the linear subtraction scheme can result in an enhancement of more than 1 order of magnitude in the exclusion limits of Gaia-like experiments in the low-frequency range.

<title>Probing the High-frequency Variability of NGC 5044: The Key to Active Galactic Nucleus Feedback</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The active galactic nucleus (AGN) feeding and feedback process in the centers of galaxy clusters and groups is still not well understood. NGC 5044 is the ideal system in which to study AGN feedback. It hosts the largest known reservoir of cold gas in any cool-core galaxy group, and features several past epochs of AGN feedback imprinted as cavities in the X-ray-bright intragroup medium, as well as parsec-scale jets. We present Submillimeter Array, Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array high-frequency observations of NGC 5044 to assess the time variability of the millimeter-wave band emission from the accretion disk, and quantify the spectral energy distribution (SED) from the radio to submillimeter band. The SED is well described by an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model and self-absorbed jet emission from an aging plasma with τ ∼ 1 kyr. We find a characteristic variability timescale of 150 days, which constrains the ADAF emission region to about 0.1 pc, and the magnetic field to ∼4.7 mG in the jets and 870 G in the accretion disk. Longer monitoring/sampling will allow to understand if the underlying process is truly periodic in nature.

<title>The IMF Clock Angle Effect on the Tail Cross Section of the Martian Magnetic Pileup Boundary and Bow Shock</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using a three-dimensional global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation model, we investigate the effects of different interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) clock angles on the tail configuration of the Martian magnetic pileup boundary (MPB) and bow shock (BS). The study reveals the following: (1) The cross sections of the tail MPB and BS are approximately elliptical. The MPB tail cross section generally elongates in the direction of the IMF clock angle, whereas the BS tail cross section is roughly elongated perpendicular to the IMF clock angle direction. (2) An IMF with a northward component can cause the tail cross section of the MPB to shift slightly to the south when the intense crustal magnetic fields are located on the dayside. (3) As the tail distance from Mars increases, the eccentricity of the cross section ellipses of both the MPB and BS tail increases, as well as the major and minor axes. Additionally, the major and minor axes of the tail MPB’s cross section ellipses begin to decrease at the far magnetotail, suggesting that the Martian MPB tail might be a closed structure on the nightside.

<title>Cosmological Prediction of the Void and Galaxy Clustering Measurements in the CSST Spectroscopic Survey</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The void power spectrum is related to the clustering of low-density regions in the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe and can be used as an effective cosmological probe to extract information on the LSS. We generate galaxy mock catalogs from a Jiutian simulation and identify voids using the watershed algorithm for studying the cosmological constraint strength of the China Space Station Telescope spectroscopic survey. The galaxy and void autopower spectra and void−galaxy cross-power spectra at z = 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 are derived from the mock catalogs. To fit the full power spectra, we propose to use the void average effective radius at a given redshift to simplify the theoretical model, and we adopt the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique to implement the constraints on the cosmological and void parameters. The systematic parameters, such as galaxy and void biases and noise terms in the power spectra, are also included in the fitting process. We find that our theoretical model can correctly extract the cosmological information from the galaxy and void power spectra, which demonstrates its feasibility and effectivity. The joint constraint accuracy of the cosmological parameters can be improved by ∼20% compared to that of the galaxy power spectrum only. The fitting results of the void density profile and systematic parameters are also well constrained and consistent with the expectation. This indicates that the void-clustering measurement can be an effective complement to the galaxy-clustering probe, especially for the next-generation galaxy surveys.

<title>Double-edged Sword: The Influence of Tidal Interaction on Stellar Activity in Binaries</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using the LAMOST DR7 low-resolution spectra, we carried out a systematic study of stellar chromospheric activity in both single and binary stars. We constructed a binary sample and a single-star sample, mainly using the binary belt and the main sequence in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, respectively. By comparing the S indices between single and binary stars within each color bin, we found for K-type stars, binaries exhibit enhanced activity compared to single stars, which could be attributed to the increase in spin rate caused by tidal synchronization or to the interactions of magnetic fields. Both single stars and binaries fall on a common sequence in the activity-period relation, indicating that the chromospheric activities of binaries are dominated by the more active components. More intriguingly, in some color ranges, a slight decline of the S index for smaller orbital periods was observed for binary stars. Although the possibility of sample selection effects cannot be excluded, this may mark the first example of supersaturation (i.e., caused by reduced active regions) being detected in chromospheric activity, or provide evidence of the suppressing effect on the magnetic dynamo and stellar activities by strong tidal interaction in very close binaries. Our study suggests that tidal interaction acts as a double-edged sword in relation to stellar activities.

Despite the significance of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in space weather, a comprehensive understanding of their interior morphology remains a scientific challenge, particularly with the advent of many state-of-the-art solar missions such as Parker Solar Probe (Parker) and Solar Orbiter (SO). In this study, we present an analysis of a complex CME as observed by the Wide-Field Imager for Solar PRobe (WISPR) heliospheric imager during Parker’s seventh solar encounter. The CME morphology does not fully conform with the general three-part density structure, exhibiting a front and core not significantly bright, with a highly structured overall configuration. In particular, its morphology reveals nonconcentric nested rings, which we argue are a signature of the embedded helical magnetic flux rope of the CME. For that, we analyze the morphological and kinematical properties of the nested density structures and demonstrate that they outline the projection of the three-dimensional structure of the flux rope as it crosses the lines of sight of the WISPR imager, thereby revealing the magnetic field geometry. Comparison of observations from various viewpoints suggests that the CME substructures can be discerned owing to the ideal viewing perspective, close proximity, and spatial resolution of the observing instrument.

<div> 关键词: 脉冲星、闪烁带宽、动态谱、电子密度模型、Arecibo望远镜

总结:<br /><br />这项工作使用了Arecibo望远镜的数据，尝试对脉冲星的动态谱进行分析，测量其闪烁带宽。研究发现，闪烁带宽的测量结果大多数情况下超过了NE2001和YMW16两个流行的银河模型的预测。此外，对闪烁带宽的高斯拟合结果与电子密度模型的预测更加一致。先前的文献数值测量结果存在较大差异，这可能与时间变化的星际介质参数有关。该研究拓展了AO327的范围，进一步探讨了这些趋势，突显了大型档案数据集在项目初始概念之外仍具有重要意义。 <div>
A pulsar’s scintillation bandwidth is inversely proportional to the scattering delay, making accurate measurements of scintillation bandwidth critical to characterize unmitigated delays in efforts to measure low-frequency gravitational waves with pulsar timing arrays. In this pilot work, we searched for a subset of known pulsars within ∼97% of the data taken with the Puerto Rico Ultimate Pulsar Processing Instrument for the AO327 survey with the Arecibo telescope, attempting to measure the scintillation bandwidths in the data set by fitting to the 2D autocorrelation function of their dynamic spectra. We successfully measured 38 bandwidths from 23 pulsars (six without prior literature values), finding that: almost all of the measurements are larger than the predictions from NE2001 and YMW16 (two popular galactic models); NE2001 is more consistent with our measurements than YMW16; Gaussian fits to the bandwidth are more consistent with both electron density models than Lorentzian ones; and for the 17 pulsars with prior literature values, the measurements between various sources often vary by a few factors. The success of Gaussian fits may be due to the use of Gaussian fits to train models in previous work. The variance of literature values over time could relate to the scaling factor used to compare measurements, but also seems consistent with time-varying interstellar medium parameters. This work can be extended to the rest of AO327 to further investigate these trends, highlighting the continuing importance of large archival data sets for projects beyond their initial conception.

总结:<br /><br />本研究探讨了太阳等离子体的热非平衡状态，发现在适当的局部和全局加热率组合下，即使在具有可观的质量和能量通量的跨声速太阳风中，等离子体也可能呈现热非平衡状态。这表明在太阳风的稳态条件下，等离子体能够承受的足点加热量存在限制，并可能有助于解释从太阳表面高度浓缩磁通量区域发出的太阳风流的变化。这一发现对于高密度太阳风的各种来源具有重要意义，包括形成在极区日冕空洞的混合磁极性区域上方的羽流以及从日冕空洞边界发出的慢速太阳风。 <div>
Thermal nonequilibrium (TNE) is a condition of the plasma in the solar corona in which the local rate of energy loss due to radiation increases to the point that it cannot be sustained by the various heating terms acting on the plasma, precluding the existence of a steady state. The limit cycles of precipitation and evaporation that result from TNE have been simulated in 1D models of coronal loops, as well as 2D and 3D models of the solar chromosphere and lower corona. However, a careful study of TNE in the solar wind has not been performed until now. Here, we demonstrate that for suitable combinations of local and global heating rates, it is possible for the plasma to exhibit a TNE condition, even in the context of a transonic solar wind with appreciable mass and energy fluxes. This implies limits on the amount of footpoint heating that can be withstood under steady-state conditions in the solar wind, and may help to explain the variability of solar wind streams that emanate from regions of highly concentrated magnetic flux on the solar surface. The implications of this finding pertain to various sources of high-density solar wind, including plumes that form above regions of mixed magnetic polarity in polar coronal holes and the slow solar wind that emanates from coronal hole boundaries.

Astrophysical emission lines arising from particle decays can offer unique insights into the nature of dark matter (DM). Using dedicated simulations with background and foreground modeling, we comprehensively demonstrate that the recently launched X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) space telescope with powerful X-ray spectroscopy capabilities is particularly well suited to probe decaying DM, such as sterile neutrinos and axion-like particles, in the mass range of a few to tens of keV. We analyze and map XRISM’s DM discovery potential parameter space by considering the Milky Way Galactic DM halo, including establishing an optimal line-of-sight search, as well as dwarf galaxies, where we identify Segue 1 as a remarkably promising target. We demonstrate that with only 100 ks exposure, the XRISM/Resolve instrument is capable of probing the underexplored DM parameter window around a few keV and testing DM couplings with a sensitivity that exceeds by two orders existing Segue 1 limits. Further, we demonstrate that XRISM/Xtend instrument sensitivity enables discovery of the nature of faint astrophysical X-ray sources, especially in Segue 1, which could shed light on star formation history. We discuss implications for decaying DM searches with improved detector energy resolution in future experiments.

<div> 红移、宇宙黎明、光子、中性氢原子、温度耦合
总结:
红移为宇宙黎明时期形成的第一个星体发射的光子在Lyα和Lyman限频率之间。这些光子对中性氢原子的自旋温度和星际介质的动力学温度进行耦合，并通过与氢原子交换能量影响动力学温度。研究发现，星系群介质中所含的光子大约有10%-20%为注入光子。在这种情况下，系统在大约1百万年内达到热平衡，最终温度在50-100K之间。而连续光子的准静态平衡则需要约1亿年的时间，在z≃20时期相当于宇宙的年龄。此外，文章还简要讨论了Lyα诱导加热对宇宙黎明时期的21厘米信号的影响。 <div>
The first star-forming objects that formed at high redshifts during the cosmic dawn (CD) also emitted photons between Lyα and Lyman-limit frequencies. These photons are instrumental in coupling the spin temperature of the neutral hydrogen (H i) atoms with the kinetic temperature of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Along with this coupling effect, these photons also impact the kinetic temperature by exchanging energy with the H i atoms. The injected Lyα photons in general cool the medium, while the continuum photons heat the medium. While studying this effect in the literature, a quasi-static profile around the Lyα frequency is assumed. In this paper, we solve the time-dependent coupled dynamics of the photon intensity profile along with the evolution of the thermal state of the IGM and H i spin temperature. It is expected that, during the CD era, the IGM has a mix of continuum photons with 10%–20% of injected photons. For this case, we show that the system reaches thermal equilibrium in around 1 Myr, with the final temperature in the range 50–100 K. This timescale is comparable to the source lifetime of Population III stars at high redshifts. One impact of switching off short-lived sources is that it can keep the system heated above the temperature of the quasi-static state. We also show that the quasi-static equilibrium for the continuum photons is only achieved on timescales of 100 Myr at z ≃ 20, comparable to the age of the Universe. We also briefly discuss how the Lyα induced heating can impact the 21 cm signal from CD.

总结:
太阳风暴是一种强大的太阳现象，可以导致严重的空间天气事件。预测CME到达地球的时间非常重要。文章评估了一种名为SPM3的预测模型，发现其对高太阳活动年份的预测效果更好。研究还发现CME的角宽度越大，相应的IP冲击波到达地球的概率就越高。总体来说，SPM3对CME事件的预测效果良好，对太阳活动的影响及CME的起源经度也能提供有价值的信息。 <div>
Coronal mass ejection (CME) is a powerful solar phenomenon that can lead to severe space weather events. Forecasting whether and when the corresponding interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) will reach the Earth is very important in space weather study and forecast. At present, many different kinds of models use the near-Sun CME observations as model inputs to predict its propagation with similar prediction accuracies for large sample events. Among a series of physics-based models, the best-performing version of the shock propagation model (SPM) for large sample events, i.e., SPM3, had achieved a good forecast effect for the 23rd Solar Cycle events (1997.02–2006.12). To further evaluate SPM3, we collected CME events from 2013 January to 2023 July from the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) CME scoreboard as a new data set. SPM3 achieved a total prediction success rate of 57% for these new events with a mean absolute error of 8.93 hr and a rms error of 10.86 hr for the shock's arrival time. Interestingly, SPM3 provided better predictions for the CME/shock events during high solar activity years than low solar activity years. We also analyzed the influence of input parameters on CME propagation and found that the larger the angular width of the CME event, the higher the probability of the corresponding IP shock's reaching the Earth. Source latitude had little effect on the arrival probability of the corresponding shock, while source longitude did. The CMEs originating from around W15° had the largest probability of hitting the Earth.

<div> N-body 模型, 金属丰度梯度, 银河演化, 条形不稳定性, 垂直加热机制
<br /><br />总结:
本研究通过构建单盘和三盘N-body模型，发现了银河系中金属丰度梯度的形成机制。外部贫金属颗粒通过条形不稳定性向内运动，并在杆状结构形成后经历更显著的垂直加热，使其最终位于更大的垂直高度。这一“两步加热”机制线性地将前体盘中的径向金属丰度梯度转化为垂直金属丰度梯度。通过与具有径向独立高斯金属丰度的三盘模型的比较发现，尽管存在某些局限，但“两步加热”机制在塑造银河系垂直金属丰度梯度中仍然很重要。如果杆状和屈曲不稳定性对形成箱状/花生形天鹅座臂起到贡献，那么“两步加热”机制在箱状/花生形天鹅座臂的演化中不可避免。 <div>
A vertical metallicity gradient (VMG) in the Milky Way bulge is well-established. Yet, its origin has not been fully understood under the Galactic secular evolution scenario. We construct single-disk and triple-disk N-body models with an initial radial metallicity gradient (RMG) for each disk. These models generate a VMG through a “two-step heating” mechanism: the outer, metal-poor particles move inward via the bar instability and subsequently undergo more significant vertical heating during the buckling instability, so they end up at greater vertical height. The “two-step heating” mechanism nearly linearly transforms the RMGs in precursor disks into VMGs. Comparing the models with a triple-disk model tagged with radially independent Gaussian metallicity, we find that, despite certain limitations, the “two-step heating” mechanism is still important in shaping the Galactic VMG. If the bar and buckling instabilities contributed to the formation of boxy/peanut-shaped bulges, then the “two-step heating” mechanism is inevitable in the secular evolution of a boxy/peanut-shaped bulge.

In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the IRS 17 filament within the intermediate-mass protocluster IRAS 08448-4343 (of ∼103L⊙), using ALMA data from the ATOMS 3 mm and QUARKS 1.3 mm surveys. The IRS 17 filament, which spans ∼54,000 au (0.26 pc) in length and ∼4000 au (0.02 pc) in width, exhibits a complex, multicomponent velocity field and harbors hierarchical substructures. These substructures include three bundles of seven velocity-coherent fibers and 29 dense (n ∼ 108 cm−3) condensations. The fibers have a median length of ∼4500 au and a median width of ∼1400 au. Among these fibers, four are identified as “fertile,” each hosting at least three dense condensations, which are regarded as the “seeds” of star formation. While the detected cores are randomly spaced within the IRS 17 filament based on the 3 mm dust continuum image, periodic spacing (∼1600 au) of condensations is observed in the fertile fibers according to the 1.3 mm dust map, consistent with the predictions of linear isothermal cylinder fragmentation models. These findings underscore the crucial role of fibers in star formation and suggest a hierarchical fragmentation process that extends from the filament to the fibers and, ultimately, to the smallest-scale condensations.

<div> 红移，宇宙学模型，暗能量，伽马射线暴，伽马射线暴的谱学观测
总结:
红移z≳10处的亮星系的丰度大大超过了ΛCDM模型在较低红移处测得的星形成效率的外推所预期的值。文章探讨了这种现象与当前宇宙学模型中假定的暗能量(Λ)的关系，提出了一种假定Λ为基态的量子场的暗能量模型，并考察了这种模型对高红移处星系UV光度函数的影响。研究发现，这种模型自然地影响了红移10≲z≲15处的星系UV光度，且ΩΛ = [−0.6, −0.3]的取值与独立宇宙学探测所需的值非常一致。此外，这种模型对红移15≲z≲16处亮星系丰度的急剧下降提出了明确的预测。 <div>
Recent observations by JWST yield a large abundance of luminous galaxies at z ≳ 10 compared to that expected in the ΛCDM scenario based on extrapolations of the star formation efficiency measured at lower redshifts. While several astrophysical processes can be responsible for such observations, here we explore to what extent such an effect can be rooted in the assumed dark energy (DE) sector of the current cosmological model. This is motivated by recent results from different cosmological probes combined with the last data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, which indicate a tension in the DE sector of the concordance ΛCDM model. We have considered the effect of assuming a DE characterized by a negative Λ as the ground state of a quintessence field on the galaxy luminosity function at high redshifts. We find that such models naturally affect the galaxy UV luminosities in the redshift range 10 ≲ z ≲ 15 needed to match the JWST observations, and with the value of ΩΛ = [−0.6, −0.3] remarkably consistent with that required by independent cosmological probes. A sharp prediction of such models is the steep decline of the abundance of bright galaxies in the redshift range 15 ≲ z ≲ 16.

该研究分析了PDS 456这一极端明亮的类星体的JWST MIRI/Medium Resolution Spectroscopy (MRS)数据，发现了延伸至15千秒差距的多相气体流出，包括温暖分子气体和离子化气体的发射。研究还显示，这一强大的类星体在广泛范围内驱动了辐射驱动风，并改变了宿主星系的离子化结构。尽管PDS 456的极端亮度使得即使在这一邻近对象中也很难研究其延伸发射，但通过使用 NIRSpec 和 MUSE IFS 数据立方体，成功地减轻了MIRI/MRS仪器效应。通过在源内和源外进行了核心尘埃发射的探测，研究团队的工作为了解宇宙中的类星体贡献了重要的信息。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究分析了PDS 456极端明亮的类星体的MIRI/MRS数据，发现了多相气体流出和辐射驱动风，以及对宿主星系离子化结构的影响。 <div>
Fast accreting, extremely luminous quasars contribute heavily to the feedback process within galaxies. While these systems are most common at cosmic noon (z ∼ 2), here we choose to study PDS 456, an extremely luminous (Lbol ∼ 1047 erg s−1) but nearby (z ∼ 0.185) quasar where the physics of feedback can be studied in greater detail. We present the results from our analysis of the JWST MIRI/Medium Resolution Spectroscopy (MRS) integral field spectroscopic (IFS) data of this object. The extreme brightness of PDS 456 makes it challenging to study the extended emission even in this nearby object. MIRI/MRS instrumental effects are mitigated by using complementary NIRSpec and MUSE IFS data cubes. We show clear evidence of a multiphase gas outflow extending up to 15 kpc from the central source. This includes emission from warm molecular (H2ν = 0–0 and 1–0) and ionized (e.g., Paα, [O iii], [Ne iii], and [Ne vi]) gas with typical blueshifted velocities down to −500 km s−1. We are also able to probe the nuclear dust emission in this source through silicate and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission features but are unable to spatially resolve it. Our results are consistent with this powerful quasar driving a radiatively driven wind over a broad range of distances and altering the ionization structure of the host galaxy.

中国地震电磁卫星上的高能粒子探测器（HEPD-01）采集了2018年8月至2022年6月的事件率数据，并检测到与GRB候选源相关的12个显著超额。这些数据经过建模、比对和分析，生成了0.3-50MeV光子的光子曲线和GRB观测时间、持续时间、积分计数和通量的观测目录。这些结果对比其他空间望远镜的发现，为GRB的研究提供了重要数据。 <div>
The High-Energy Particle Detector (HEPD-01) on board the China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite, located on a Sun-synchronous orbit at 500 km of altitude with an inclination of 97°, features a dedicated logic counting low-energy event rates, which proved sensitive to intense Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB). The present work reports a comprehensive analysis of signals induced by GRBs in the event-rate data collected between 2018 August and 2022 June. After accurately modeling the background rate as observed in different passages of the satellite over the same geographical area, we detected significant deviations to be compared with observations of GRB candidates from other observatories. The analysis revealed 12 statistically significant excesses, that have been associated with GRB 181222B, GRB 190114C, GRB 190129B, GRB 190305A, GRB 190928A, GRB 200412B, GRB 200422A, GRB 200826B, GRB 201009A, GRB 210702A, GRB 211211A, and GRB 220624A. We report light curves for 0.3–50 MeV photons, comparing them with findings from other space telescopes. The catalog of observations is published, complete of GRB observation time, duration, integrated counts, and fluence.

<div> 关键词: 行星大气，污染，行星形成，水和硅酸盐，化学组成

总结: 通过模拟行星大气的污染过程，研究了外行星的初始化学成分如何可能被改变。研究发现，通过不同尺寸和成分的行星碎片的蒸发，行星大气污染将受到热状态的饱和限制。水冰的污染可以导致大气中水质量分数变化2-4个数量级。这意味着后期污染可能会消除形成时的化学成分记忆，使原本在冰线外形成的外行星可能会转变为水世界。同时，还讨论了在水和难挥发的碳物质污染下的预期碳氧比例分布。 <div>
The atmospheric composition of exoplanets is often considered as a probe of the planet’s formation conditions. How exactly the initial chemical memory may be altered from the birth to the final state of the planet, however, remains unknown. Here, we develop a simple model of pollution of planetary atmosphere by the vaporization of infalling planetesimals of varying sizes and composition (SiO2 inside 1 au and H2O outside 1 au), following their trajectory and thermal evolution through the upper advective and radiative layers of a sub-Neptune-class planet during the late stage of disk evolution. We vary the rate of pollution by changing the solid content of the disk and by dialing the level of disk gas depletion, which in turn determines the rate of planetary migration. We find that pollution by silicate grains will always be limited by the saturation limit set by the thermal state of the atmosphere. By contrast, pollution by water ice can lead to ∼2–4 orders of magnitude variation in the atmospheric water mass fraction depending on the solid and gas content of the disk. Both cases suggest that post-formation pollution can erase the initial compositional memory of formation. Post-formation pollution can potentially transform sub-Neptunes with H/He-dominated envelopes that initially formed beyond the ice line to water worlds (i.e., with a water-enriched envelope) when the disk gas is depleted by ≳2 orders of magnitude, allowing gentle migration. We additionally discuss the expected C/O ratio profile under pollution by water and refractory carbon species.

利用开普勒观测到的恒星数据，结合之前的研究成果，对FGK类恒星的自转周期和锂含量进行分析，得出了这些参数可以作为恒星年龄的经验指标。研究结果表明，通过自转周期得出的恒星年龄与开放星团中的恒星年龄一致，并且与独立的锂年龄结果相符。在Kepler观测过的23813颗恒星中，有63颗行星的年龄小于10亿岁，而有109颗行星的年龄中值低于10亿岁，这一结果与之前的假设不符，表明Kepler观测到的年轻恒星数量比年龄为30亿岁的恒星少3至5倍。这种现象的出现是由于恒星运动速度增加和银河薄盘恒星形成速率下降的综合因素，对已知的过境外行星的年龄分布产生了影响。<br /><br />总结: 利用Kepler观测数据，研究了FGK类恒星的自转周期和锂含量对恒星年龄的影响。结果显示Kepler观测到的年轻恒星数量与传统假设不符，这可能是由于恒星运动速度增加和银河薄盘恒星形成速率下降所致。 <div>
Recent analyses of FGK stars in open clusters have helped clarify the precision with which a star’s rotation rate and lithium content can be used as empirical indicators for its age. Here we apply this knowledge to stars observed by Kepler. Rotation periods are drawn from previous work; lithium is measured from new and archival Keck/HIRES spectra. We report rotation-based ages for 23,813 stars (harboring 795 known planets) for which our method is applicable. We find that our rotational ages recover the ages of stars in open clusters spanning 0.04–2.5 Gyr; they also agree with ≳90% of the independent lithium ages. The resulting yield includes 63 planets younger than 1 Gyr at 2σ, and 109 with median ages below 1 Gyr. This is about half the number expected under the classic assumption of a uniform star formation history. The age distribution that we observe, rather than being uniform, shows that the youngest stars in the Kepler field are 3–5 times rarer than stars 3 Gyr old. This trend holds for both known planet hosts and for the parent stellar sample. We attribute this “demographic cliff” to a combination of kinematic heating and a declining star formation rate in the Galaxy’s thin disk, and highlight its impact on the age distribution of known transiting exoplanets.

<div> 关键词: 太阳耀斑, 电子加速, 太阳射电爆发, 电子输运, 空间天气事件
总结:
太阳耀斑引起的电子加速和观测到的III型太阳射电爆发不仅是理解内部太阳圈层电子输运的重要诊断工具，而且可能是潜在有害空间天气事件的早期指示。电子束在太阳冕层和太阳圈层沿磁场线传播产生朗缪波，并在速度空间中准线性地松弛达到一个平台。在短距离上观察到的电子束松弛与观测到的大束游程距离形成对比，通常被称为Sturrok的困境。该研究开发了一种新的电子输运模型，其准线性距离/时间在空间和时间上自洽地变化。该模型导出了电子束密度的非线性对流扩散方程，其非线性扩散项与束密度成反比。该解预测了快速传播电子束的缓慢超扩散（弹道）空间扩展。该模型还提供了朗缪波的谱能量密度演变，决定了太阳爆发等离子辐射的亮度温度。该模型解与使用动力学方程数值模拟的结果一致，并可以解释一些III型太阳射电爆发的特征。 <div>
Electrons accelerated by solar flares and observed as type III solar radio bursts are not only a crucial diagnostic tool for understanding electron transport in the inner heliosphere but also a possible early indication of potentially hazardous space weather events. The electron beams traveling in the solar corona and heliosphere along magnetic field lines generate Langmuir waves and quasilinearly relax toward a plateau in velocity space. The relaxation of the electron beam over the short distance in contrast to large beam-travel distances observed is often referred to as Sturrok’s dilemma. Here, we develop a new electron transport model with quasilinear distance/time self-consistently changing in space and time. This model results in a nonlinear advection-diffusion equation for the electron beam density with a nonlinear diffusion term that is inversely proportional to the beam density. The solution predicts slow super-diffusive (ballistic) spatial expansion of a fast-propagating electron beam. This model also provides the evolution of the spectral energy density of Langmuir waves, which determines brightness temperature of plasma radiation in solar bursts. The model solution is consistent with the results of numerical simulation using kinetic equations and can explain some characteristics of type III solar radio bursts.

Several hundreds of thousands of eclipsing binaries (EBs) are expected to be detected in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) full frame images (FFIs). This represents a significant increase in the number of EBs available for eclipse timing variation studies. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of performing precise eclipse timing of TESS EBs using the FFIs. To this end, we developed a fast, automated method and applied it to a sample of ∼100 EBs selected from the Villanova TESS EB catalog. Our timing analysis resulted in the detection of 10 new triple candidates with outer periods shorter than ∼1300 days. For five of them, we were able to constrain the outer orbit by analyzing independently the short-cadence (SC) and FFI data and to derive the minimum mass of the third body with a precision better than 4% for SC and 11% for FFI data. We then compared the results obtained from the two data sets and found that using the FFI data leads to (1) a degradation of both the accuracy and precision of the tertiary mass determination for the tightest EBs and (2) an overall underestimation of the third component’s mass. However, we stress that our main conclusions on the nature of the detected signals do not depend on which data set is used. This confirms the great potential of TESS FFIs, which will allow us to search for rare objects such as substellar circumbinary companions and compact triple stellar systems.

本文利用磷-氢-氧（PHO）光化学网络，模拟了氢为主要成分的热木星和暖海王星系外行星大气中的磷化氢光化学过程。结果显示，在类似HD 189733b热木星的大气中，对过境和发射光谱重要的压力范围内，HOPO、PO和P2通常是主要的磷携带者，而不是PH3。而对于类似GJ1214b的暖海王星大气，结果表明，在太阳金属丰度下，PH3在没有光化学作用的情况下占主导地位，但在其他化学环境中通常不会存在大量PH3。在10和100倍太阳金属丰度下，氧化磷小分子如HOPO和PO在热化学和光化学模拟中占主导地位。虽然改进了PHO网络的精度，但仍有大量反应速率数据是不确定或缺失的，这可能会对目前的研究结论产生重大影响。未来，改进对含磷化学反应动力学的理解将成为天文学家在近期内探测含磷物质（如磷化氢）的关键工作。 <br /><br />总结: 本文使用PHO光化学网络模拟了热木星和暖海王星系外行星大气中的磷化氢光化学过程，发现在不同的化学环境下，磷化氢和其他磷物质的丰度存在显著差异。然而，网络中仍有大量反应速率数据是不确定或缺失的，需要进行进一步的研究和完善。 <div>
Due to the detection of phosphine (PH3) in the solar system gas giants Jupiter and Saturn, PH3 has long been suggested to be detectable in exosolar substellar atmospheres too. However, to date, direct detection of phosphine has proven to be elusive in exoplanet atmosphere surveys. We construct an updated phosphorus-hydrogen-oxygen (PHO) photochemical network suitable for the simulation of gas giant hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. Using this network, we examine PHO photochemistry in hot Jupiter and warm Neptune exoplanet atmospheres at solar and enriched metallicities. Our results show for HD 189733b-like hot Jupiters that HOPO, PO, and P2 are typically the dominant P carriers at pressures important for transit and emission spectra, rather than PH3. For GJ1214b-like warm Neptune atmospheres our results suggest that at solar metallicity PH3 is dominant in the absence of photochemistry, but is generally not in high abundance for all other chemical environments. At 10 and 100 times solar, small oxygenated phosphorus molecules such as HOPO and PO dominate for both thermochemical and photochemical simulations. The network is able to reproduce well the observed PH3 abundances on Jupiter and Saturn. Despite progress in improving the accuracy of the PHO network, large portions of the reaction rate data remain with approximate, uncertain, or missing values, which could change the conclusions of the current study significantly. Improving understanding of the kinetics of phosphorus-bearing chemical reactions will be a key undertaking for astronomers aiming to detect phosphine and other phosphorus species in both rocky and gaseous exoplanetary atmospheres in the near future.

WTP 19aalnxx是一颗在KUG 0022-007星系外围发现的明亮的中红外瞬变体，表现出CSM相互作用迹象，并且在中红外波段的辐射强度超过光学波段。该瞬变体在2018年首次被发现，与2015年的光学对应源相比，其在4.6微米波段的峰值绝对明度约为-22Vega，并且在大约3年内达到了峰值。通过光谱能量分布建模，估计存在大约10^-2太阳质量的暖尘埃，可能是在冷密壳中形成的。深度光学光谱证实了强烈的CSM相互作用迹象。研究发现，还有16个核心坍缩超新星在NEOWISE数据中表现出延迟的红外明亮信号，这表明密集的CSM壳可能存在于小于10^17厘米的区域。同步红外调查为揭示晚期CSM相互作用提供了新的途径，也为探索大质量恒星的终末质量损失增加了见解。 <br /><br />总结: NEOWISE发现了一颗在星系外围的明亮中红外瞬变体WTP 19aalnxx，其在中红外波段的辐射强度超过光学波段。光学对应源在2015年时约为其5倍的光度。通过光谱能量分布建模，估计存在大约10^-2太阳质量的暖尘埃，可能是在冷密壳中形成的。16个核心坍缩超新星在NEOWISE数据中表现出延迟的红外明亮信号，这表明密集的CSM壳可能存在于小于10^17厘米的区域。 <div>
While core-collapse supernovae (SNe) often show early and consistent signs of circumstellar medium (CSM) interaction, some exhibit delayed signatures due to interaction with distant material around the progenitor star. Here we present the discovery in NEOWISE data of WTP 19aalnxx, a luminous mid-infrared (MIR) transient in the outskirts of the galaxy KUG 0022-007 at ≈190 Mpc. First detected in 2018, WTP 19aalnxx reaches a peak absolute (Vega) magnitude of ≈−22 at 4.6 μm in ≈3 yr, comparable to the most luminous interacting SNe. Archival data reveal a ≳5× fainter optical counterpart detected since 2015, while follow-up near-infrared observations in 2022 reveal an extremely red (Ks − W2 ≈ 3.7 mag) active transient. Deep optical spectroscopy confirm strong CSM interaction signatures via intermediate-width Balmer emission lines and coronal metal lines. Modeling the broadband spectral energy distribution, we estimate the presence of ≳10−2M⊙ of warm dust, likely formed in the cold dense shell. Together with the lack of nebular Fe emission, we suggest that WTP 19aalnxx is a missed, low (optical) luminosity SN in an emerging family of core-collapse SNe distinguished by their CSM-interaction-powered MIR emission that outshines the optical bands. Investigating the Zwicky Transient Facility sample of SNe with NEOWISE data, we find 16 core-collapse SNe (≳3% in a volume-limited sample) without early signs of CSM interaction that exhibit delayed IR brightening, suggestive of dense CSM shells at ≲1017 cm. We suggest that synoptic IR surveys offer a new route to revealing late-time CSM interaction and the prevalence of intense terminal mass loss in massive stars.

<br /><br />总结:
这篇论文探讨了恒星质量黑洞在X射线双星系统中的X射线光谱特征以及相关模型。其中提到了X射线谱的三个组成部分：来自薄冷吸积盘的热成分，来自热辐射区的康普顿化成分，以及由热辐射区照射冷吸积盘产生的反射成分。文中使用了灯柱状辐射区的模型，并对黑洞X射线双星系统的X射线光谱进行了改进计算。研究表明，反射光谱既有来自辐射区的直接辐射，也有来自热成分和反射成分的返回辐射。另外，通过计算来自X射线通量和局部电子密度的照射，自洽地计算了吸积盘的电离参数。最后，对模型的预测进行了讨论，并指出了当前的局限性以及改进的下一步计划。 <div>
In the disk–corona model, the X-ray spectrum of a stellar-mass black hole in an X-ray binary is characterized by three components: a thermal component from a thin and cold accretion disk, a Comptonized component from a hot corona, and a reflection component produced by illumination of the cold disk by the hot corona. In this paper, we assume a lamppost corona, and we improve previous calculations of the X-ray spectrum of black hole X-ray binaries. The reflection spectrum is produced by the direct radiation from the corona as well as by the returning radiation of the thermal and reflection components and is calculated considering the actual spectrum illuminating the disk. If we turn the corona off, the reflection spectrum is completely generated by the returning radiation of the thermal component, as it may happen for some sources in soft spectral states. After choosing the radial density profile of the accretion disk, the ionization parameter is calculated self-consistently at any radial coordinate of the disk from the illuminating X-ray flux and the local electron density. We show the predictions of our model in different regimes, and we discuss its current limitations as well as the next steps to improve it.

脉冲星Calvera的新准确视运动和相位连接的星历使用了Chandra和NICER观测数据。Calvera的视运动指向一个环形射电环的中心，这与以往低显著性的测量结果有很大不同。这为超新星遗迹与脉冲星的关联提供了更简单的解释，并且支持了超新星确实在不到10千年前诞生了Calvera，当时它的自转周期接近现在的值。脉冲星的切向速度取决于其不确定的距离，但可能主要受超新星的脱逃动力学影响，而其祖星可能是银河盘附近的一个O或B型星。 <br /><br />总结：这篇文章报道了脉冲星Calvera的新观测结果和新星历的推导，证实了其与一个超新星遗迹的关联，推测了其诞生不到10千年，并提出了其祖星可能是一个银河盘附近的超新星。 <div>
Calvera (1RXS J141256.0+792204) is a pulsar of characteristic age 285 kyr at a high Galactic latitude of b = +37°, detected only in soft thermal X-rays. We measure a new and precise proper motion for Calvera using Chandra High Resolution Camera observations obtained 10 yr apart. We also derive a new phase-connected ephemeris using 6 yr of NICER data, including the astrometric position and proper motion as fixed parameters in the timing solution. Calvera is located near the center of a faint, circular radio ring that was recently discovered by LOFAR and confirmed as a supernova remnant (SNR) by the detection of γ-ray emission with Fermi Large Area Telescope. The proper motion of 78.5 ± 2.9 mas yr−1 at position angle 241.°3 ± 2.°2 (in Galactic coordinates) points away from the center of the ring, a result which differs markedly from a previous low-significance measurement, and greatly simplifies the interpretation of the SNR/pulsar association. It argues that the supernova indeed birthed Calvera <10 kyr ago, with an initial spin period close to its present value of 59 ms. The tangential velocity of the pulsar depends on its uncertain distance, vt = (372 ± 14)d1 kpc km s−1, but is probably dominated by the supernova kick, while its progenitor could have been a runaway O or B star from the Galactic disk.

<title>Do Strong Bars Exhibit Strong Noncircular Motions?</title>

Galactic bars induce characteristic motions deviating from pure circular rotation, known as noncircular motions. As bars are nonaxisymmetric structures, stronger bars are expected to show stronger noncircular motions. However, this has not yet been confirmed by observations. We use a bisymmetric model to account for the stellar kinematics of 14 barred galaxies obtained with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer and characterize the degree of bar-driven noncircular motions. For the first time, we find tight relations between the bar strength (bar ellipticity and torque parameter) and the degree of stellar noncircular motions. We also find that the bar strength is strongly associated with the stellar radial velocity driven by bars. Our results imply that stronger bars exhibit stronger noncircular motions. Noncircular motions beyond the bar are found to be weak, comprising less than 10% of the strength of the circular motions. We find that galaxies with a boxy/peanut (B/P) bulge exhibit a higher degree of noncircular motions and higher stellar radial velocity compared to galaxies without a B/P bulge, by 30% ∼ 50%. However, this effect could be attributed to the presence of strong bars in galaxies with a B/P feature in our sample, which would naturally result in higher radial motions, rather than to the B/P bulges themselves inducing stronger radial motions. More observational studies, utilizing both stellar and gaseous kinematics on statistically complete samples, along with numerical studies are necessary to draw a comprehensive view of the impact that B/P bulges have on bar-driven noncircular motions.

<div> 关键词: Galactic cosmic rays, solar modulation, heliosphere, force-field approximation, AMS-02 data
总结:
本研究利用AMS-02月度数据，通过月度数据对质子和氦的通量以及它们的比值的变化进行分析，研究了2011年5月至2017年5月的太阳调制的演变。研究利用非参数化方法推导了质子和氦的局部星际光谱，并对高能和低能范围分别赋予不同的太阳调制电位，利用Sigmoid函数描述了它们之间的过渡。分析发现，质子和氦通量的突变出现在大约6 GV的刚度值处，而且在HMF反转期间这一突变更加明显。此外，研究还发现质子和氦的长期比率变化可以从模型中自然推导出来，考虑了不同的Z/A值和质子和氦的局部星际光谱。  <br /><br /> <div>
Galactic cosmic rays suffer from solar modulation when they propagate through the heliosphere. The transfer of the local interstellar spectrum (LIS) to the top-of-atmosphere spectra is influenced by solar wind convection, and diffusion on the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF), among other factors. In this work, we derive the LIS of proton (p) and helium (He) covering energies from a few MeV/n to TeV/n, using a nonparameterization method. The study utilizes monthly AMS-02 data on proton and helium fluxes and their ratio to examine the evolution of solar modulation from 2011 May to 2017 May. To improve the fitting, the force-field approximation is modified by assigning different solar modulation potentials for high (ϕh) and low (ϕl) energy ranges. A sigmoid function is employed to describe the transition between these energy ranges. The analysis reveals that the break in proton and helium fluxes occurs at the same rigidity value, with a mean of approximately 6 GV and this break is more pronounced during the HMF reversal period. The ϕl is close to the result of Advanced Composition Explorer while the ϕh is close to the result of neutron monitor data. Furthermore, the long-term behavior of the proton-to-helium ratio ratio is found to naturally arise from the model when considering different Z/A values and the LISs for proton and helium.

<div> 关键词: NGC 99, 光谱学, 金属丰度, 天体物理学, 气体吸积
总结: 
NGC 99是一个活跃的星系，研究人员通过光谱学和观测数据，发现了该星系内部的金属丰度梯度。两个异常低金属丰度区域显示出与其他区域不同的特征，这被解释为气体吸积的间接证据。此外，研究还发现星系内部的星际介质与周银河介质中的Lyα云可能存在共转运动，可能是低金属丰度气体吸积的一种可能途径。最后，研究人员使用局部气相金属丰度、恒星质量面密度和恒星形成率面密度计算了解决的基本金属丰度关系，发现了与之前研究得出的结果相似的趋势。 <div>
As a part of the Deciphering the Interplay between the Interstellar medium, Stars, and the Circumgalactic medium (DIISC) survey, we investigate indirect evidence of gas inflow into the disk of the galaxy NGC 99. We combine optical spectra from the Binospec spectrograph on the MMT telescope with optical imaging data from the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope, radio H i 21 cm emission images from the NSF Karl G. Jansky’s Very Large Array, and UV spectroscopy from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. We measure emission lines (Hα, Hβ, [O iii]λ5007, [N ii]λ6583, and [S ii]λ6717, 31) in 26 H ii regions scattered about the galaxy and estimate a radial metallicity gradient of −0.017 dex kpc−1 using the N2 metallicity indicator. Two regions in the sample exhibit an anomalously low metallicity (ALM) of 12 + log(O/H) = 8.36 dex, which is ∼0.16 dex lower than other regions at that galactocentric radius. They also show a high difference between their H i and Hα line of sight velocities on the order of 35 km s−1. Chemical evolution modeling indicates gas accretion as the cause of the ALM regions. We find evidence for corotation between the interstellar medium of NGC 99 and Lyα clouds in its circumgalactic medium, which suggests a possible pathway for low metallicity gas accretion. We also calculate the resolved Fundamental Metallicity Relation (rFMR) on subkiloparsec scales using localized gas-phase metallicity, stellar mass surface density, and star formation rate surface density. The rFMR shows a similar trend as that found by previous localized and global FMR relations.

The National Science Foundation’s Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) will provide high-resolution, multiline spectropolarimetric observations that are poised to revolutionize our understanding of the Sun. Given the massive data volume, novel inference techniques are required to unlock its full potential. Here, we provide an overview of our “SPIn4D” project, which aims to develop deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for estimating the physical properties of the solar photosphere from DKIST spectropolarimetric observations. We describe the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling and the Stokes profile synthesis pipeline that produce the simulated output and input data, respectively. These data will be used to train a set of CNNs that can rapidly infer the four-dimensional MHD state vectors by exploiting the spatiotemporally coherent patterns in the Stokes profile time series. Specifically, our radiative MHD model simulates the small-scale dynamo actions that are prevalent in quiet-Sun and plage regions. Six cases with different mean magnetic fields have been explored; each case covers six solar-hours, totaling 109 TB in data volume. The simulation domain covers at least 25 × 25 × 8 Mm, with 16 × 16 × 12 km spatial resolution, extending from the upper convection zone up to the temperature minimum region. The outputs are stored at a 40 s cadence. We forward model the Stokes profile of two sets of Fe i lines at 630 and 1565 nm, which will be simultaneously observed by DKIST and can better constrain the parameter variations along the line of sight. The MHD model output and the synthetic Stokes profiles are publicly available, with 13.7 TB in the initial release.

<div> 脉冲星，伽马射线，周期振荡，双超大质量黑洞系统，多波段观测
<br /><br />总结:
本研究使用了15年的Fermi天文台观测数据，发现了PG 1553+113类星体的伽马射线流量存在2.1年周期振荡。观测数据显示了大于7个周期的伽马射线调制，具有4σ的显著性。光学和射电光变曲线与伽马射线调制表现出明显的相关性，可能有不同的时间滞后。研究指出，这种伽马射线的周期性可能来源于一个双超大质量黑洞系统，其中一个黑洞的质量比较大，产生周期性的星体吸积流，影响喷流的物质和能量。其他可能的天体物理情景包括不稳定性、盘和喷流的进动、自转或章动，以及处于极坐标轨道的大质量星体或中等质量黑洞的扰动。 <div>
A 2.1 yr periodic oscillation of the gamma-ray flux from the blazar PG 1553+113 has previously been tentatively identified in ∼7 yr of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. After 15 yr of Fermi sky-survey observations, doubling the total time range, we report >7 cycle gamma-ray modulation with an estimated significance of 4σ against stochastic red noise. Independent determinations of oscillation period and phase in the earlier and the new data are in close agreement (chance probability <0.01). Pulse timing over the full light curve is also consistent with a coherent periodicity. Multiwavelength new data from Swift X-Ray Telescope, Burst Alert Telescope, and UVOT, and from KAIT, Catalina Sky Survey, All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, and Owens Valley Radio Observatory ground-based observatories as well as archival Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer satellite-All Sky Monitor data, published optical data of Tuorla, and optical historical Harvard plates data are included in our work. Optical and radio light curves show clear correlations with the gamma-ray modulation, possibly with a nonconstant time lag for the radio flux. We interpret the gamma-ray periodicity as possibly arising from a pulsational accretion flow in a sub-parsec binary supermassive black hole system of elevated mass ratio, with orbital modulation of the supplied material and energy in the jet. Other astrophysical scenarios introduced include instabilities, disk and jet precession, rotation or nutation, and perturbations by massive stars or intermediate-mass black holes in polar orbit.

本文介绍了Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument (MIRI) Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES)，这是一项利用James Webb Space Telescope拍摄的八波段MIRI调查，并在GOODS-S/HUDF区域进行近红外光谱仪的后续研究的项目。SMILES利用MIRI的连续覆盖面积从5.6到25.5μm，极大地扩展了我们对被遮挡的宇宙的理解。文章还介绍了提供的初步数据，包括八个MIRI成像拼接图和一个5-25.5μm的光度目录。SMILES的研究结果将极大地拓展我们对被遮挡的宇宙的认识。 <div>
The James Webb Space Telescope is revolutionizing our view of the Universe through unprecedented sensitivity and resolution in the infrared, with some of the largest gains realized at its longest wavelengths. We present the Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument (MIRI) Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES), an eight-band MIRI survey with Near-Infrared Spectrograph spectroscopic follow-up in the GOODS-S/HUDF region. SMILES takes full advantage of MIRI’s continuous coverage from 5.6 to 25.5 μm over an ∼34 arcmin2 area to greatly expand our understanding of the obscured Universe up to cosmic noon and beyond. This work, together with a companion paper by G. Rieke et al., covers the SMILES science drivers and technical design, early results with SMILES, data reduction, photometric catalog creation, and the first data release. As part of the discussion on early results, we additionally present a high-level science demonstration on how MIRI’s wavelength coverage and resolution will advance our understanding of cosmic dust using the full range of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission features from 3.3 to 18 μm. Using custom background subtraction, we produce robust reductions of the MIRI imaging that maximize the depths reached with our modest exposure times (∼0.6−2.2 ks per filter). Included in our initial data release are (1) eight MIRI imaging mosaics reaching depths of 0.2−18 μJy (5σ) and (2) a 5−25.5 μm photometric catalog with over 3000 sources. Building upon the rich legacy of extensive photometric and spectroscopy coverage of GOODS-S/HUDF from the X-ray to the radio, SMILES greatly expands our investigative power in understanding the obscured Universe.

<div> 联系双星，光变曲线，频谱分析，长期变化，物理参数
<br />
这篇论文通过对八个全食接触双星进行光度和光谱研究。使用里昂大学发展的光谱分析软件分析了光谱数据，并使用PHOEBE和马尔科夫链蒙特卡洛采样对光度数据进行了分析。研究中使用了两种方法来计算MCMC的初始值：一种是我们提出的新方法，用于模拟不带斑点的光变曲线，而另一种是遗传算法，用于确定带斑点的物理参数。研究结果表明，这八个目标都是接触双星，质量比小于0.25。其中四个系统呈现了O'Connell效应，在主要组件上添加一个黑斑可以得到理想的拟合。与此同时，发现两个系统是浅接触双星，而其余六个是中等接触双星。另外，对这八颗食双星进行了O-C分析，发现其中七颗呈现出长期变化。其中四颗显示出轨道周期的长期减小趋势，而其他三颗显示出轨道周期的长期增加趋势，还有两个目标呈现周期性变化。周期的减小可能是由于质量从更大的组件转移到更小的组件，而增加可能是由于质量转移方向的相反。此外，还计算了这八个系统的绝对物理参数、轨道角动量、初始质量和年龄，并分析了它们的质量-光度和质量-半径分布。 
<br /><br />总结: 这项研究表明了八颗全食接触双星的特征，并发现了它们的长期变化规律，从而得出了它们的物理参数和质量-光度、质量-半径分布。 <div>
This paper selected eight totally eclipsing contact binaries for photometric and spectroscopic studies. Spectral data were analyzed by University of Lyon Spectroscopic analysis Software, and photometric data were analyzed using PHOEBE through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. We used two methods to calculate the initial values for running MCMC: one method is a new approach proposed by ourselves to model light curves without spots, while the other method is the genetic algorithm, which can determine physical parameters with spots. The results imply that these eight targets are all contact binary stars with a small mass ratio below 0.25. There are four systems exhibiting the O’Connell effect. By adding a dark spot on the primary component, the ideal fitting can be obtained. Meanwhile, it was found that two systems are shallow contact binaries, while the remaining six are moderate contact binaries. An O − C analysis of the eight eclipsing binary stars revealed that seven of them exhibit long-term changes. Four of them display a long-term decreasing trend in orbital period, while the other three show a long-term increasing trend, and two targets exhibit periodic variations. A decrease in period may be caused by the transfer of matter from the more massive component to the less massive component, while an increase in period may be caused by transfer in the opposite way. The absolute physical parameters, orbital angular momentum, initial masses, and ages of these eight systems were calculated. Additionally, their mass–luminosity and mass–radius distributions were analyzed.

Metals in the diffuse, ionized gas at the boundary between the Milky Way’s interstellar medium (ISM) and circumgalactic medium, known as the disk–halo interface (DHI), are valuable tracers of the feedback processes that drive the Galactic fountain. However, metallicity measurements in this region are challenging due to obscuration by the Milky Way ISM and uncertain ionization corrections that affect the total hydrogen column density. In this work, we constrain ionization corrections to neutral hydrogen column densities using precisely measured electron column densities from the dispersion measures of pulsars that lie in the same globular clusters as UV-bright targets with high-resolution absorption spectroscopy. We address the blending of absorption lines with the ISM by jointly fitting Voigt profiles to all absorption components. We present our metallicity estimates for the DHI of the Milky Way based on detailed photoionization modeling of the absorption from ionized metal lines and ionization-corrected total hydrogen columns. Generally, the gas clouds show a large scatter in metallicity, ranging between 0.04 and 3.2 Z⊙, implying that the DHI consists of a mixture of gaseous structures having multiple origins. We estimate the inflow and outflow timescales of the DHI ionized clouds to be 6–35 Myr. We report the detection of an infalling cloud with supersolar metallicity that suggests a Galactic fountain mechanism, whereas at least one low-metallicity outflowing cloud (Z < 0.1 Z⊙) poses a challenge for Galactic fountain and feedback models.

总结:
本文开发了基于Python的先进次海王星演化模型，同时考虑了幼年时期≤1 Myr的形成后沸腾和来自内部冷却的长寿命核动力损失(∼Gyr)。我们研究了初始H/He熵、核发光、能量对流、辐射大气结构以及过渡到X射线和紫外驱动的质量损失阶段在行星质量损失和热演化方面的作用。特别着重于H/He包层的再平衡过程，包括推动流体动力风的能源和能量传输时间尺度，我们发现沸腾和核动力逃逸主要由恒星总辐射驱动。我们进一步发现，沸腾和核动力逃逸与热演化脱节。我们发现，考虑初始H/He质量分数和初始熵的沸腾阶段后，后续的核动力逃逸对小行星的统计特征影响微乎其微，因为它最多只能去掉0.1%的H/He质量分数。我们直接将数值结果与先前关于个体演化轨迹和小行星族群的分析核动力质量损失建模的工作进行了比较。我们检查了先前研究中做出的一些假设，这些假设与我们的发现相比造成了显著差异。我们发现，虽然沸腾能够完全从一个高辐射(≥100 F⊕)、低质量核心(Mc ≤ 4 M⊕)的行星上剥离气态包层，但无法单独形成观测到的小行星族群中看到的明显半径差。 <div>
We develop a Python-based state-of-the-art sub-Neptune evolution model that incorporates both the post-formation boil-off at young ages ≤1 Myr and long-lived core-powered mass loss (∼Gyr) from interior cooling. We investigate the roles of initial H/He entropy, core luminosity, energy advection, radiative atmospheric structure, and the transition to an X-ray- and ultraviolet-driven mass-loss phase, with an eye on relevant timescales for planetary mass loss and thermal evolution. With particular attention to the re-equilibration process of the H/He envelope, including the energy sources that fuel the hydrodynamic wind, and energy transport timescales, we find that boil-off and core-powered escape are primarily driven by stellar bolometric radiation. We further find that both boil-off and core-powered escape are decoupled from the thermal evolution. We show that, with a boil-off phase that accounts for the initial H/He mass fraction and initial entropy, post-boil-off core-powered escape has an insignificant influence on the demographics of small planets, as it is only able to remove at most 0.1% of the H/He mass fraction. Our numerical results are directly compared to previous work on analytical core-powered mass-loss modeling for individual evolutionary trajectories and populations of small planets. We examine a number of assumptions made in previous studies that cause significant differences compared to our findings. We find that boil-off, though able to completely strip the gaseous envelope from a highly irradiated (F ≥ 100 F⊕) planet that has a low-mass core (Mc ≤ 4 M⊕), cannot by itself form a pronounced radius gap as is seen in the observed population.

The magnetic cloud within an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) is characterized by high magnetic field intensities. In this study, we investigate the interaction of a magnetic cloud carrying a density structure with the Earth’s bow shock during the ICME event on 2023 April 24. Elevated abundances of cold protons and heavier ions, namely, alpha particles and singly charged helium ions, associated with the prominence plasma are observed within this structure. The plasma downstream of the bow shock exhibits an irregular compression pattern, which could be due to the presence of heavy ions. Heavy ions carry a significant fraction of the upstream flow energy; however, due to their different mass-per-charge ratio and rigidity, they are less scattered by the electromagnetic and electrostatic waves at the shock. We find that downstream of the shock, while the ion thermal energy is only a small fraction of the background magnetic energy, nevertheless increased ion fluxes reduce the characteristic wave speeds in that region. As such, we observe a transition state of an unstable bow shock in which the plasma flow is super Alfvénic both upstream and downstream of the bow shock. Our findings help with the understanding of the intense space weather impacts of such events.

<br />
红外微弱的白矮星通常被认为是由于H2-He的碰撞诱导吸收引起的红外光谱缺失。这篇文章使用詹姆斯·韦伯空间望远镜对LHS 3250、WD J1922+0233和LHS 1126进行了近红外和中红外光谱观测。观测结果表明，LHS 3250在2.4微米处观测到了一个意外的小的流量峰，而不是预期的H2-He吸收。WD J1922+0233在2.4微米处观测到了预期强烈的吸收特征，但是在这个吸收带内部观测到了意想不到的窄的发射特征。LHS 1126在中红外没有观测到H2-He的吸收特征，并且在中红外呈现出λ^-2的功率律。这些发现表明IR微弱的白矮星可能比先前认为的温暖且更为庞大，这需要进一步的JWST观测来加以确认。此外，研究探讨了这两颗星体中意想不到的发射特征的可能解释，温度反转在此被认为是一个有希望的假设。这些发现可能影响它们的光度拟合，强调了进一步的JWST观测对这一现象的普遍性进行确认和改进大气模型的重要性。
<br /><br />总结:这篇文章观测了三颗红外微弱的白矮星的近红外和中红外光谱。观测结果显示，一颗白矮星出现了意外的小的流量峰，另一颗出现了窄的发射特征，还有一颗在中红外呈现出λ^-2的功率律。这些发现表明红外微弱的白矮星可能比先前认为的温暖且更为庞大。研究探讨了这两颗星体中意想不到的发射特征的可能解释，认为温度反转在此是一个有希望的假设。这些发现强调了进一步的观测对这一现象的普遍性进行确认和改进大气模型的重要性。 <div>
Infrared-faint white dwarfs are cool white dwarfs exhibiting significant infrared flux deficits, most often attributed to collision-induced absorption (CIA) from H2–He in mixed hydrogen–helium atmospheres. We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) near- and mid-infrared spectra of three such objects using Near-Infrared Spectrograph (0.6–5.3 μm) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (5–14 μm): LHS 3250, WD J1922+0233, and LHS 1126. Surprisingly, for LHS 3250, we detect no H2–He CIA absorption at 2.4 μm, instead observing an unexpected small flux bump at this wavelength. WD J1922+0233 exhibits the anticipated strong absorption feature centered at 2.4 μm, but with an unexpected narrow emission-like feature inside this absorption band. LHS 1126 shows no CIA features and follows a λ−2 power law in the mid-infrared. LHS 1126's lack of CIA features suggests a very low hydrogen abundance, with its infrared flux depletion likely caused by He–He–He CIA. For LHS 3250 and WD J1922+0233, the absence of a 1.2 μm CIA feature in both stars argues against ultracool temperatures, supporting recent suggestions that infrared-faint (IR-faint) white dwarfs are warmer and more massive than previously thought. This conclusion is further solidified by Keck near-infrared spectroscopy of seven additional objects. We explore possible explanations for the unexpected emission-like features in both stars, and temperature inversions above the photosphere emerge as a promising hypothesis. Such inversions may be common among the IR-faint population, and since they significantly affect the infrared spectral energy distribution, this would impact their photometric fits. Further JWST observations are needed to confirm the prevalence of this phenomenon and guide the development of improved atmospheric models.

该研究利用2014年至2018年的高分辨率光谱数据，对RS CVn型双星SZ Piscium (SZ Psc)的磁活跃K成分进行了九幅多普勒影像的展示。研究使用最小二乘去卷积（LSD）提取平均轮廓，重新构建表面图，并研究了K型次巨星的星斑、表面差分旋转以及三重星组件的吸收线。研究发现，K成分的星斑沿纬度和经度广泛分布，在相位0附近存在一个明显的极区非对称星斑，并且星斑在1个月的时间尺度内发生演变。通过交叉相关方法，确定了2017年11月至12月间相隔10天的星斑图，计算出K成分的表面差分旋转参数为Ωeq = 1.591 ± 0.002 rad day−1和ΔΩ = 0.035 ± 0.003 rad day−1。同时通过检测LSD轮廓中来自SZ Psc的三重星成分的吸收线，测量了双星系统和三重星成分的径向速度，得到了三重星成分的轨道周期为1530 ± 3天，质量为0.75 ± 0.06 M⊙。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究利用高分辨率光谱数据对SZ Piscium的磁活跃K成分进行了多普勒影像展示，揭示了其表面星斑分布和演变，以及表面差分旋转参数，并确定了三重星成分的轨道周期和质量。 <div>
We present a series of nine Doppler images of the magnetically active K component of the RS CVn-type binary SZ Piscium (SZ Psc), based on high-resolution spectroscopic data collected from 2014 to 2018. We apply least-squares deconvolution (LSD) to all spectra to extract the average profiles with high signal-to-noise ratios for Doppler imaging. The surface maps of the K subgiant show starspots widely distributed along its latitude and longitude. A prominent, nonaxisymmetric polar spot around phase 0 is revealed by all images with sufficient phase coverage, which may be a stable feature on the K component. The starspots evolve over a timescale of 1 month. We have determined the surface shear rate of the K component from starspot maps reconstructed 10 days apart in 2017 November–December through the cross-correlation method. The surface differential rotation parameters are Ωeq = 1.591 ± 0.002 rad day−1 and ΔΩ = 0.035 ± 0.003 rad day−1. The absorption lines contributed from the tertiary component of SZ Psc are detected in all LSD profiles, and we measure the radial velocity of the binary system and the tertiary component to derive an elliptical orbit with a period of 1530 ± 3 days and a mass of 0.75 ± 0.06 M⊙ for the tertiary component.

这篇文章报告了使用升级的巨型米波射电望远镜（uGMRT）进行的深度射电观测的结果。观测到了七个临近的大型星系，采用0.3–0.5 GHz接收机，角分辨率约为10″，实现的灵敏度范围约为15到50 μJy/beam−1，比先前在这些频率进行的观测低了约3–4个数量级。对于两个具有适度倾斜角的星系（NGC 3344和NGC 3627），首次观测到了显著的漫射辐射。在四个几乎边缘朝向的星系（NGC 3623、NGC 4096、NGC 4594和NGC 4631）中，垂直方向上探测到的射电晕在0.4 GHz的图像中明显比约1.5 GHz的观测结果更大。此外，在星系盘面上也检测到了明显更大的射电晕。用0.144、0.4和约1.5 GHz的图像制作了七个样本星系的光谱指数图，发现在星系晕区域的光谱呈陡峭变化，达到了约-1.5的数值。

We present the results of deep radio observations of seven nearby large galaxies observed using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) 0.3–0.5 GHz receivers with an angular resolution of ∼10″. The achieved sensitivities of these observations range from ≈15 to 50 μJy beam−1, which is a factor of ≈3–4 lower than the previous observations at these frequencies. For two galaxies (NGC 3344 and NGC 3627) with moderate inclination angles, significant diffuse emissions are seen for the first time. The detected radio halos in the vertical direction are significantly larger in our 0.4 GHz maps compared to the observations at ∼1.5 GHz for four nearly edge-on galaxies—NGC 3623, NGC 4096, NGC 4594, and NGC 4631. For these four galaxies, significantly larger halos are also detected along the galaxy disk. For NGC 3623 and NGC 4594, we could detect elongated radio disks that were not seen before. We also present new uGMRT images of NGC 3344 and NGC 3623 at 1.3 GHz and a new VLA image of NGC 3627 at 1.5 GHz. We fitted an exponential function to the flux densities along different cross-cuts and found a significantly wider distribution at the 0.4 GHz uGMRT images compared to the high-frequency images at ∼1.5 GHz. Using maps at 0.144, 0.4, and ∼1.5 GHz, we made spectral index maps of the seven sample galaxies and found a steepening of the spectrum up to a value of ∼−1.5 in the halo regions of the galaxies.

<div> 高纬度星斑，快速旋转的恒星还显示低纬度斑点。流出模型预测在快速旋转恒星中磁通会朝向极向偏转，留下赤道附近没有斑点的带状区域。文章研究了一个太阳型恒星在底部对流层附近的磁通管，假设弱管爆炸会增强磁场。研究发现，需要高度超临界的磁场强度才能在快速旋转的恒星中形成活跃区，这需要在对流区内形成100 kG管道的爆炸。总结：高纬度星斑；低纬度斑点；磁通朝极向偏转；磁场强度；对流区内管道爆炸。 <div>
Besides a dense coverage of their high latitudes by starspots, rapidly rotating cool stars also display low-latitude spots in Doppler images, although generally with lower coverage. In contrast, flux emergence models of fast-rotating stars predict strong poleward deflection of radially rising magnetic flux as the Coriolis effect dominates over buoyancy, leaving a spot-free band around the equator. To resolve this discrepancy, we consider a flux tube near the base of the convection zone in a solar-type star rotating 8 times faster than the Sun, assuming field intensification by weak-tube explosions. For the intensification to continue into the buoyancy-dominated regime, the upper convection zone must have a significantly steeper temperature gradient than in the Sun by a factor that is comparable with that found in 3D simulations of rotating convection. Within the hypothesis that stellar active regions stem from the base of the convection zone, flux emergence between the equator and 20° latitudes requires highly supercritical field strengths of up to 500 kG in rapidly rotating stars. These field strengths require explosions of 100 kG tubes within the convection zone, compatible with reasonable values of the superadiabatic temperature gradient associated with the more rapid rotation.

We study spectra produced by weakly accreting black hole (BH) systems using the semianalytic advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model and the general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation. We find significant differences between these two approaches related to a wider spread of the flow parameters as well as a much steeper radial distribution of the magnetic field in the latter. We apply these spectral models to the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of the nucleus of the M87 galaxy. The standard (in particular, 1D) formulation of the ADAF model does not allow us to explain it; previous claims that this model reproduces the observed SED suffer from an inaccurate treatment of the Compton process. The spectra based on GRMHD simulation are in a much better agreement with the observed data. In our GRMHD model, in which we assumed the BH spin a = 0.9, the bulk of radiation observed between the millimeter and the X-ray range is produced in the disk area within 4 gravitational radii from the BH. In this solution, the synchrotron component easily reproduces the spectral data between the millimeter and the UV range, and the Compton component does not violate the X-rays constraints, for yr−1 and a relatively strong magnetic field, with the plasma β ∼ 1 in the region where radiation is produced. However, the Compton component cannot explain the observed X-ray spectrum. Instead, the X-ray spectrum can be reproduced by a high-energy tail of the synchrotron spectrum if electrons have a hybrid energy distribution with a ∼5% nonthermal component.

<div> LOFAR, M31, supernova remnants, radio spectral indices, interstellar medium
<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用LOFAR在150 MHz频率下对M31中心进行了观测，并清晰地探测到了三个超新星遗迹。通过对这些遗迹的表征，包括与其他射电和X射线数据的比较，我们得出了它们的详细特征。另外，我们还对历史上的SN 1885A进行了上限估算，发现即使在低频率的150 MHz下也未探测到。分析模型表明，SN 1885A将至少在未来几个世纪内保持自由膨胀阶段。我们还对SN 1885A的星际介质密度进行了估算，结果显示介质密度不大于0.04 cm−3，并且超新星喷发密度的分布不会比∝r−9（平均值）更浅。此外，我们在X射线观测中发现了2.6σ的临时探测，分析结果表明非热辐射预计将主导SN 1885A的辐射。通过与G1.9+0.3的比较，我们发现G1.9+0.3的不对称性使得其比SN 1885A更有效地产生射电和X射线辐射。对于该地区的其他遗迹Braun 80、95和101，我们估计它们的年龄分别为5200、8100和13,100年，并且冲击速度分别为1150、880和660 km s−1。基于这些结果，我们推测M31中心0.5 kpc × 0.6 kpc区域的超新星速率至少为约3000年一次。最后，我们对遗迹的射电谱指数进行了估计，结果分别为−0.66 ± 0.05、−0.37 ± 0.03和−0.50 ± 0.03，与先前研究相当吻合。 <div>
We present the first LOFAR image of the center of M31 at a frequency of 150 MHz. We clearly detect three supernova remnants, which, along with archival VLA data at 3 GHz and other published radio and X-ray data, allows us to characterize them in detail. Our observations also allow us to obtain upper limits of the historical SN 1885A, which is undetected even at a low frequency of 150 MHz. From analytical modeling, we find that SN 1885A will stay in its free-expansion phase for at least another couple of centuries. We find an upper limit of nH ≲ 0.04 cm−3 for the interstellar medium of SN 1885A, and that the SN ejecta density is not shallower than ∝r−9 (on average). From the 2.6σ tentative detection in X-ray, our analysis shows that nonthermal emission is expected to dominate the SN 1885A emission. Comparing our results with those on G1.9+0.3, we find that it is likely that the asymmetries in G1.9+0.3 make it a more efficient radio and X-ray emitter than SN 1885A. For Braun 80, 95, and 101, the other remnants in this region, we estimate ages of 5200, 8100, and 13,100 yr, and shock speeds of 1150, 880, and 660 km s−1, respectively. Based on this, the supernova rate in the central 0.5 kpc × 0.6 kpc of M31 is at least one per ∼3000 yr. We estimate radio spectral indices of −0.66 ± 0.05, −0.37 ± 0.03, and −0.50 ± 0.03 for the remnants, respectively, which match fairly well with previous studies.

Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are sensitive to low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs), which induce correlated changes in millisecond pulsars’ timing residuals. PTA collaborations around the world have recently announced evidence of a nanohertz gravitational wave background (GWB), which may be produced by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). The GWB is often modeled as following a power-law power spectral density (PSD); however, a GWB produced by a cosmological population of SMBHBs is expected to have a more complex power spectrum due to the discrete nature of the sources. In this paper, we investigate using a t-process PSD to model the GWB, which allows us to fit for both the underlying power-law amplitude and spectral index as well as deviations from that power law, which may be produced by individual nearby binaries. We create simulated data sets based on the properties of the NANOGrav 15 yr data set, and we demonstrate that the t-process PSD can accurately recover the PSD when deviations from a power law are present. With longer timed data sets and more pulsars, we expect the sensitivity of our PTAs to improve, which will allow us to precisely measure the PSD of the GWB and study the sources producing it.

这篇文章讨论了利用透镜星系中的类星体进行微引力透镜观测，以有效探测类星体的聚积物理。研究人员通过微引力透镜观测可以约束类星体聚积盘的半光半径，结合时间滞后测量结果，首次估计了驱动波段间时间滞后和盘发射交叉相关性的物理过程的传播速度。他们针对研究充分的透镜类星体Q0957+561进行了盘回响映射研究，测量了 Zwicky Transient Facility 的 g 和 r 波段的交叉相关性；结果显示 g 的变化在静止坐标系中领先于 r 的变化 6.4 ± 2.6 天。结合现有文献中的半光半径，研究人员发现变异机制的传播速度应为光速的一个倍数。他们还讨论了这一结果的可能影响，并指出类似研究可通过利用遗产空间与时空观测来应用于其他透镜类星体。 <div>
The measurement of continuum time lags in lensed quasars can effectively probe the accretion physics of quasars. This is because microlensing observations of lensed quasars can provide constraints on the half-light radii of quasar accretion disks. By combining the microlensing results with time lag measurements, one can, for the first time, estimate the propagation velocity of the physical process that drives interband time lags and cross correlations among disk emission (i.e., in UV/optical bands). In this study, we perform the disk reverberation mapping study for the well-studied lensed quasar, Q0957+561. The cross correlation between the Zwicky Transient Facility g and r bands was measured; the g variations lead the r ones by 6.4 ± 2.6 days in the rest frame. In combination with the half-light radius from the existing literature, we find that the propagation velocity of the variability mechanism should be times the speed of light. We discuss the possible outcomes of this result. Similar studies can be applied to other lensed quasars by utilizing the Legacy Survey of Space and Time observations.

Magnetic braking (MB) plays an important role in driving the evolution of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). The modified MB prescription, the convection and rotation boosted (CARB) model, is very successful in reproducing the detected mass-transfer rates of persistent neutron star (NS) LMXBs. In this work, we investigate whether the CARB MB prescription could account for the formation and evolution of some NS and black hole (BH) LMXBs with an observed orbital-period derivative. Using the MESA code, we perform a detailed binary evolution model for six NS and three BH LMXBs. Our simulations find that the CARB MB prescription can successfully reproduce the observed donor-star masses, orbital periods, and period derivatives of four NS LMXBs and one BH LMXB. Our calculated effective temperatures are in good agreement with the detected spectral types of two NS LMXBs and one BH LMXB. However, the standard MB model makes it difficult to produce the observed period derivatives of those LMXBs experiencing a rapid orbital shrinkage or expansion.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The electromagnetic field is a fundamental force in nature that regulates the formation of stars in the Universe. Despite decades of efforts, a reliable assessment of the importance of the magnetic fields in star formation relations remains missing. In star formation research, our acknowledgment of the importance of magnetic fields is best summarized by the R. M. Crutcher et al. B–ρ relation, whose interpretation remains controversial. The relation is either interpreted as proof of the importance of a magnetic field in gravitational collapse or as the result of self-similar collapse where the role of the magnetic field is secondary to gravity. Using simulations, we find a fundamental relation, –kB−ρ (the slope of the B–ρ relation): This fundamental B–ρ slope relation enables one to measure the Alfvénic Mach number, a direct indicator of the importance of the magnetic field, using the distribution of data in the B–ρ plane. It allows us to apply the following empirical B–ρ relation: which offers an excellent fit to the Crutcher et al. data, where we assume an relation ( ). The foundational relation provides an independent way to measure the importance of the magnetic field against the kinematic motion using multiple magnetic-field measurements. Our approach offers a new interpretation of the classical B–ρ relation, where a gradual decrease in the importance of B at higher densities is implied.

<title>Model-independent Calibration for Sound Horizon: Combining Observations of Supernovae and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation Measurements</title>

The sound horizon scale is a key theoretical prediction of the cosmological model that depends on the speed of sound in the baryon-photon fluid and the rate of expansion of the early Universe, before matter and radiation decoupled. Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) offer the direct measurement of this important scale imprinted in the distribution of galaxies. We propose a new model-independent method to calibrate the sound horizon (relative standard ruler) by using the latest observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and 2D BAO measurements. The final result is Mpc h−1 in the framework of the Pantheon SN Ia data set. This result changes to Mpc h−1 when the Pantheon+ data set is used. To highlight our analysis and results, we also use BAO DESI measurements and obtain the best-fitting value Mpc h−1. Note that even without an estimate of the dimensionless Hubble constant h, the combination of 2D BAO and SN Ia data sets already constrains the low-redshift standard ruler scale at the ∼1.26% level (at the ∼1.00% level in the framework of BAO DESI data set). More importantly, it is interesting to note that most of the obtained at high redshifts have systematically larger values: 9 out of 15 results are larger than the result obtained by combining all 2D BAOs. This finding may give us a better understanding of the discordance between the data sets, shed light on the Hubble tension, or reveal the need for new physics beyond the standard cosmological model.

We investigated two consecutive solar eruption events in the solar active region 12994 at the solar eastern limb on 2022 April 15. We found that the flare loops formed by the first eruption were involved in the second eruption. During the initial stage of the second flare, the middle part of these flare loops (E-loops) erupted outward along with the flux ropes below, while the parts of the flare loops (I-loops1 and I-loops2) on either side of the E-loops first rose and then contracted. Approximately 1 hr after the eruption, the heights of I-loops1 and I-loops2 decreased by 9 Mm and 45 Mm, respectively, compared to before the eruption. Their maximum descent velocities were 30 km s−1 and 130 km s−1, respectively. The differential emission measure results indicate that the plasma above I-loops1 and I-loops2 began to be heated about 23 minutes and 44 minutes after the start of the second flare, respectively. Within ∼20 minutes, the plasma temperature in these regions increased from ∼3 MK to ∼6 MK. We proposed an adiabatic heating mechanism where magnetic energy would be converted into thermal and kinetic energy when the prestretched loops contract. Our calculations show that the magnetic energy required to heat the two high-temperature regions are 1029–1030 erg, which correspond to a loss of field strength of 2–3 G.

<title>A Promising Approach for Determining Neutrino Mass Hierarchy by Using Supernova Neutrino Detections</title>

The determination of neutrino mass hierarchy is crucial for particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. In this work, we propose an easy-to-use method to determine the neutrino hierarchy based on core-collapse supernova (CCSN) neutrino detections. By analyzing the expected event rates of the neutrino burst at a terrestrial water Cherenkov detector, we found that the event rates predicted by the normal and inverted hierarchy models have marked differences in the neutrino energy range 10 ∼ 20 MeV and the postbounce time <0.5 s. Within this specific energy and time range, the analytical relationship between the cumulative event number and proto–neutron star (PNS) baryon mass is extracted. Based on the normal and inverted hierarchy models, two different PNS masses can be inferred from this relationship by using the time profile of neutrino events. Then, the neutrino hierarchy can be determined by comparing the PNS mass inferred from the neutrino detections and the electromagnetic or gravitational-wave channels. Furthermore, the nonadiabatic part of the Mikheyev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein flavor conversions may also be quantified with this method, which would be very helpful for the studies of the explosion mechanism and nucleosynthesis of CCSNe.

<title>Revealing the Elusive Companion of the Red Giant Binary 2MASS J05215658+4359220 from UV HST and Astrosat/UVIT Data</title>

Black hole (BH) demographics in different environments is critical in view of recent results on massive star binarity, and of the multimessenger detectability of compact object mergers. But the identification and characterization of noninteracting BHs are elusive, especially in the sparse field stellar population. A candidate noninteractive BH + red giant (RG) binary system, 2MASS J05215658+4359220, was identified by T. A. Thompson et al. We obtained Astrosat/UVIT far-ultraviolet (FUV) imaging and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UV−optical imaging and spectroscopy of the source to test possible scenarios for the optically elusive companion. HST/STIS spectra from ≈1600 to 10230 Å are best fit by the combination of two stellar sources, a RG with Teff = 4250 ± 150 K, log g = 2.0, RRG ∼ 27.8 R⊙ (assuming a single-temperature atmosphere), and a subgiant companion with Teff = 6000 K, Rcomp = 2.7 R⊙, or Teff = 5270 K, Rcomp = 4.2 R⊙ using models with one-tenth or one-third solar metallicity, respectively, log g = 3.0, extinction EB−V = 0.50 ± 0.2, adopting the Data Release 3 Gaia distance D = 2463 ± 120 pc. No FUV data existed prior to our programs. STIS spectra give an upper limit of 10−17 erg cm−2 s−1 Å−1 shortwards of 2300 Å; an upper limit of ≳25.7 ABmag was obtained in two UVIT FUV broad bands. The nondetection of FUV flux rules out a compact companion such as a hot white dwarf. The STIS spectrum shows strong Mg iiλ2800 Å emission, typical of chromospherically active RGs. The masses inferred by comparison with evolutionary tracks, ∼1M⊙ for the RG and between 1.1 and 1.6 M⊙ for the subgiant companion, suggest past mass transfer, although the RG currently does not fill its Roche lobe. WFC3 imaging in F218W, F275W, F336W, F475W, and F606W shows an unresolved source in all filters.

<div> Gaia DR3 data, rotation curve, mass distribution, NFW model, DMD model
<br /><br />总结:
最近的研究使用了银河系的旋转曲线来研究银河系的潜力和质量分布。通过假设银河系处于杰恩斯平衡状态，他们推导出了径向距离和垂直高度范围内的旋转曲线，并使用两种不同的质量模型来约束物质分布。他们发现，DMD模型比NFW模型更好地拟合了旋转曲线上的行为，并提到研究垂直高度不同位置的旋转曲线可以更好地约束暗物质分布的几何特性。 <div>
The circular velocity curve traced by stars provides a direct means of investigating the potential and mass distribution of the Milky Way. Recent measurements of the Galaxy’s rotation curve have revealed a significant decrease in velocity for Galactic radii larger than approximately 15 kpc. While these determinations have primarily focused on the Galactic plane, the Gaia DR3 data also offer information about off-plane velocity components. By assuming the Milky Way is in a state of Jeans equilibrium, we derived the generalized rotation curve for radial distances spanning from 8.5 kpc to 25 kpc and vertical heights ranging from −2 kpc to 2 kpc. These measurements were employed to constrain the matter distribution using two distinct mass models. The first is the canonical Navarro–Frenk–White (NFW) halo model, while the second, the dark matter disk (DMD) model, posits that dark matter is confined to the Galactic plane and follows the distribution of neutral hydrogen. The best-fitting NFW model yields a virial mass of Mvir = (6.5 ± 0.5) × 1011 M⊙, whereas the DMD model indicates a total mass of MDMD = (1.7 ± 0.2) × 1011 M⊙. Our findings indicate that the DMD model generally shows a better fit to both the on-plane and off-plane behaviors at large radial distances of the generalized rotation curves than the NFW model. We emphasize that studying the generalized rotation curves at different vertical heights has the potential to provide better constraints on the geometrical properties of the dark matter distribution.

这篇文章总结了对M83星系进行的12CO (1–0)观测数据的分析结果。研究采用Atacama大型毫米/亚毫米阵列进行观测，发现星系内约5724个分子云团，其中60%的CO亮度来自质量大于10^6M⊙的云团。质量大的云团集中在星系的臂、杆和中心区域，而较小的云团更多分布在星系的臂间区域。研究还发现，云团的亮度温度与Solomon等人于1987年确定的标度关系相符，但在数量上占主导地位的亮度温度低于2K的云团明显偏离这一关系。在考虑波束展宽效应后，大部分云团的动力学参数和表面质量密度可以用内在表面质量密度约为100M⊙pc-2和动力学参数约为1来解释，这与S87的观测结果相似。这些结果对于理解M83星系内的分子云团的物理特性具有重要意义。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究通过ALMA对M83星系的12CO观测数据进行分析，发现星系内分子云团的分布特性和物理参数，以及与标度关系的关联，这有助于深入理解星系内分子云团的性质。 <div>
We present a catalog of clouds identified from the 12CO (1–0) data of M83, which was observed using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array with a spatial resolution of ∼46 pc and a mass sensitivity of ∼104M⊙ (3σ). The almost full-disk coverage and high sensitivity of the data allowed us to sample 5724 molecular clouds with a median mass of ∼1.9 × 105M⊙, which is comparable to the most frequently sampled mass of giant molecular clouds by surveys in the Milky Way (MW). About 60% of the total CO luminosity in M83's disk arises from clouds more massive than 106M⊙. Such massive clouds comprise 16% of the total clouds in number and tend to concentrate toward the arm, bar, and center, while smaller clouds are more prevalent in interarm regions. Most >106M⊙ clouds have peak brightness temperatures Tpeak above 2 K with the current resolution. Comparing the observed cloud properties with the scaling relations determined by P. M. Solomon et al. (1987, hereafter S87), Tpeak > 2 K clouds follow the relations, but Tpeak < 2 K clouds, which are dominant in number, deviate significantly. Without considering the effect of beam dilution, the deviations would suggest modestly high virial parameters (median αvir ∼ 2.7) and low surface mass densities (median Σ ∼ 22 M⊙ pc−2) for the entire cloud samples, which are similar to values found for the MW clouds by T. S. Rice et al. (2016) and M.-A Miville-Deschênes et al. (2017). However, once beam dilution is taken into account, the observed αvir and Σ for a majority of the clouds (mostly Tpeak <2 K) can be potentially explained with intrinsic Σ of ∼100 M⊙ pc−2 and αvir of ∼1, which are similar to the clouds of S87.

在这篇文章中，研究人员通过分析卫星星系在宿主暗物质晕中的丰度，探讨了星—暗质质量关系的低质量端（MH < 1011M⊙）。他们指出最近对局部星系群环境中卫星星系的分析未能充分建模卫星星系恒星质量函数中的散射主要源，即固定宿主暗物质质量下的增光历史的方差。研究人员提出了一种新的推断框架，不仅恰当考虑了晕—晕方差，而且自然地确定了宿主暗物质质量混合的量，这通常是未知的。他们使用半解析SatGen模型构建了与卫星环绕类星系调查第三版数据一致的模拟卫星星系群体。他们证明即使在最理想的情况下，晕—晕方差使得对星—暗质量关系的散射施加任何有意义的限制几乎是不可能的。甚至由100个宿主组成的卫星星系调查最多只能在95%置信水平上对散射施加约0.5 dex的上限。这是因为晕组装历史的大方差主导了星—暗质量关系的散射。这个问题可以通过将调查样本大小增加一个数量级（大约1000个宿主星系）来解决，这在即将进行的光谱调查中应该是相当容易的。<br /><br />总结: 本文研究了卫星星系丰度与宿主暗物质晕的关系，并提出了一种新的推断框架来解决散射问题。研究人员发现即使在最理想的情况下，晕—晕方差也使得对星—暗质量关系的散射施加限制几乎不可能。他们指出，这个问题可以通过将调查样本大小增加一个数量级来解决。 <div>
The abundance of satellite galaxies is set by the hierarchical assembly of their host halo. We leverage this to investigate the low-mass end (MH < 1011M⊙) of the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR), which is key to constraining theories of galaxy formation and cosmology. We argue that recent analyses of satellite galaxies in the Local Group environment have not adequately modeled the dominant source of scatter in satellite stellar mass functions: the variance in accretion histories for a fixed host halo mass. We present a novel inference framework that not only properly accounts for this halo-to-halo variance but also naturally identifies the amount of host halo mass mixing, which is generally unknown. Specifically, we use the semianalytical SatGen model to construct mock satellite galaxy populations consistent with the third data release of the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs survey. We demonstrate that even under the most idealized circumstances, the halo-to-halo variance makes it virtually impossible to put any meaningful constraints on the scatter in the SHMR. Even a satellite galaxy survey made up 100 hosts can at best only place an upper limit of ∼0.5 dex on the scatter (at the 95% confidence level). This is because the large variance in halo assembly histories dominates over the scatter in the SHMR. This problem can be overcome by increasing the sample size of the survey by an order of magnitude (∼1000 host galaxies), something that should be fairly straightforward with forthcoming spectroscopic surveys.

这篇文章报道了对于高红移星系进行光谱分析的研究。研究中利用了482个确认的z=5.0−12.9的光谱观测数据，构建了代表高红移星系的光谱模板，并报告了它们的平均特性。研究发现在z=5−11的星系中，主要以蓝色紫外连续斜率为主，表明这些星系贫尘且年轻。在我们的样本中，还发现了57个Lyα发射星系，并与非发射星系进行比较。研究结果揭示了这两类星系之间的重要内在差异，对Lyα能见度有重要影响。这些光谱模板提供了一个新的观测基准，有助于解释高红移光源的全局特性，扩展到了宇宙的早期时期。 <div>
The exceptional spectra of the most luminous z > 10 sources observed so far have challenged our understanding of early galaxy evolution, requiring a new observational benchmark for meaningful interpretation. As such, we construct spectroscopic templates representative of high-redshift, star-forming populations, using 482 confirmed sources at z = 5.0−12.9 with JWST/NIRSpec prism observations, and report on their average properties. We find z = 5−11 galaxies are dominated by blue UV continuum slopes (β = −2.3 to −2.7) and reduced Balmer indices, characteristic of dust-poor and young systems, with a shift towards bluer slopes and younger ages with redshift. The evolution is mirrored by ubiquitous C iii] detections across all redshifts (rest-frame equivalent widths of 5−14 Å), which increase in strength towards early times. Rest-frame optical lines reveal elevated ratios (O32 = 7–31, R23 = 5–8, and Ne3O2 = 1−2) and subsolar metallicities (log(O/H) = 7.3−7.9), typical of ionization conditions and metallicities rarely observed in z ∼ 0 populations. Within our sample, we identify 57 Lyα emitters, which we stack and compare to a matched sample of nonemitters. The former are characterized by more extreme ionizing conditions with enhanced C iii], C iv, and He ii + [O iii] line emission, younger stellar populations from Balmer jumps, and a more pristine interstellar medium seen through bluer UV slopes and elevated rest-frame optical line ratios. The novel comparison illustrates important intrinsic differences between the two populations, with implications for Lyα visibility. The spectral templates derived here represent a new observational benchmark with which to interpret high-redshift sources, lifting our constraints on their global properties to unprecedented heights and extending out to the earliest of cosmic times.

<div> NEOs, nongravitational accelerations, linking apparitions, orbit identification algorithms, tracklets
<br /><br />总结:
最近在近地天体（NEOs）上发现了非引力加速，这引发了在近地环境中非均向质量损失的普遍性问题。研究表明，非引力加速度可能导致不同观测时刻的位置变化，并且影响了轨道识别算法的效果。然而，通过提出新的方法来寻找未链接的天体对，可以帮助识别和链接发生非引力加速的天体。当前的链接算法通常对非引力加速度具有一定的健壮性，但是可能会错过具有大非引力加速度的天体。预计从未来的调查任务中增加天体人口后，目前的算法将更加合适。 <div>
Nongravitational accelerations in the absence of observed activity have recently been identified on near-Earth objects (NEOs), opening the question of the prevalence of anisotropic mass loss in the near-Earth environment. Motivated by the necessity of nongravitational accelerations to identify 2010 VL65 and 2021 UA12 as a single object, we investigate the problem of linking separate apparitions in the presence of nongravitational perturbations. We find that nongravitational accelerations on the order of 1 × 10–9 au day−2 can lead to a change in plane-of-sky positions of ∼1 × 103 arcsec between apparitions. Moreover, we inject synthetic tracklets of hypothetical nongravitationally accelerating NEOs into the Minor Planet Center orbit identification algorithms. We find that at large nongravitational accelerations (∣Ai∣ ≥ 1 × 10−8 au day−2) these algorithms fail to link a significant fraction of these tracklets. We further show that if orbits can be determined for both apparitions, the tracklets will be linked regardless of nongravitational accelerations, although they may be linked to multiple objects. In order to aid in the identification and linkage of nongravitationally accelerating objects, we propose and test a new methodology to search for unlinked pairs. When applied to the current census of NEOs, we recover the previously identified case but identify no new linkages. We conclude that current linking algorithms are generally robust to nongravitational accelerations, but objects with large nongravitational accelerations may potentially be missed. While current algorithms are well-positioned for the anticipated increase in the census population from future survey missions, it may be possible to find objects with large nongravitational accelerations hidden in isolated tracklet pairs.

We present the second data release of the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2 (MaDCoWS2). We expand from the equatorial first data release to most of the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey area, covering a total area of 6498 deg2. The catalog consists of 133,036 signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) ≥ 5 galaxy cluster candidates at 0.1 ≤ z ≤ 2, including 6790 candidates at z > 1.5. We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify spurious detections and include CNN-based cluster probabilities in the final catalog. We also compare the MaDCoWS2 sample with literature catalogs in the same area. The larger sample provides robust results that are consistent with our first data release. At S/N ≥ 5, we rediscover 59%–91% of clusters in existing catalogs that lie in the unmasked area of MC2. The median positional offsets are under 250 kpc, and the standard deviation of the redshifts is 0.031(1 + z). We fit a redshift-dependent power law to the relation between MaDCoWS2 S/N and observables from existing catalogs. Over the redshift ranges where the surveys overlap with MaDCoWS2, the lowest scatter is found between S/N and observables from optical/infrared surveys. We also assess the performance of our method using a mock light cone measuring purity and completeness as a function of cluster mass. The purity is above 90%, and we estimate the 50% completeness threshold at a virial mass of log(M/M⊙) ≈ 14.3. The completeness estimate is uncertain due to the small number of massive halos in the light cone, but consistent with the recovery fraction found by comparing to other cluster catalogs.

A wide range of astrophysical sources exhibit extreme and rapidly varying electromagnetic emission indicative of efficient nonthermal particle acceleration. Understanding these sources often involves comparing data with a broad range of theoretical scenarios. To this end, it is beneficial to have tools that enable not only fast and efficient parametric investigation of the predictions of a specific scenario but also the flexibility to explore different theoretical ideas. In this paper, we introduce Tleco, a versatile and lightweight toolkit for developing numerical models of relativistic outflows, including their particle acceleration mechanisms and resultant electromagnetic signature. Built on the Rust programming language and wrapped into a Python library, Tleco offers efficient algorithms for evolving relativistic particle distributions and for solving the resulting emissions in a customizable fashion. Tleco uses a fully implicit discretization algorithm to solve the Fokker–Planck equation with user-defined diffusion, advection, cooling, injection, and escape and offers prescriptions for radiative emission and cooling. These include, but are not limited to, synchrotron, inverse-Compton, and self-synchrotron absorption. Tleco is designed to be user friendly and adaptable to model particle acceleration and the resulting electromagnetic spectrum and temporal variability in a wide variety of astrophysical scenarios, including, but not limited to, gamma-ray bursts, pulsar wind nebulae, and jets from active galactic nuclei. In this work, we outline the core algorithms and proceed to evaluate and demonstrate their effectiveness. The code is open source and available in the GitHub repository: https://github.com/zkdavis/Tleco.

<div> 关键词: exoplanet, carbon-rich atmosphere, puffy Venuses, magma oceans, TOI-561 b

总结:
本研究提出了一种名为“puffy Venuses”的理论类别的外行星模型，这些行星具有厚厚的碳主导大气，并处于与全球岩浆海洋相平衡的状态。研究模型考虑了大气和岩浆海洋之间的碳和氢分配，以及整个半灰色辐射对流大气中的碳-氢-氧平衡化学反应。研究发现，碳含量为1200 ppm（或普通球粒陨石的含量）可以使地球质量的行星在1500-2000 K的平衡温度下产生约0.16-0.3 R⊕的大气膨胀。研究指出TOI-561 b可能是一个特别有希望成为puffy Venus候选行星，其低密度可能归因于厚厚的碳富大气。此外，研究还提出了55 Cancri e可能具有puffy Venus解释，最近的JWST观测表明该行星可能具有CO/CO2大气。因此，puffy Venuses可能构成对低质量外行星内部结构的一种可检验的替代解释。 <div>
The recent advancements in exoplanet observations enable the potential detection of exo-Venuses, rocky planets with carbon-rich atmospheres. How extended these atmospheres can be, given high carbon abundances, has not been studied. To answer this, we present a model for a theoretical class of exoplanets—puffy Venuses—characterized by thick, carbon-dominated atmospheres in equilibrium with global magma oceans (MOs). Our model accounts for carbon and hydrogen partition between the atmosphere and the MO, as well as the C–H–O equilibrium chemistry throughout a semi-gray, radiative-convective atmosphere. We find that radius inflation by puffy Venus atmospheres is significant on small and irradiated planets: carbon content of 1200 ppm (or that of ordinary chondrites) can generate an atmosphere of ∼0.16–0.3 R⊕ for an Earth-mass planet with equilibrium temperatures of 1500–2000 K. We identify TOI-561 b as an especially promising puffy Venus candidate, whose underdensity could be attributed to a thick C-rich atmosphere. We also advocate for a puffy Venus interpretation of 55 Cancri e, where a recent JWST observation indicates the presence of a CO/CO2 atmosphere. Puffy Venuses may thus constitute a testable alternative interpretation for the interior structure of underdense low-mass exoplanets.

Palomar-Green类星体的宿主星系中的分子和电离气体的运动学和动力学通过分析CO和Hα数据立方体来研究冷分子和热电离气体的运动学，并利用先验知识构建样本的质量分布。我们通过气体动力学研究宿主星系的动力学质量，并发现我们的动力学方法所导出的恒星质量与宽带光度和质量-光度比的一致性。我们使用我们的动力学质量模型研究了动能压力和星际介质的重量。通过研究类星体宿主星系动力学质量和重力压力之间的关系，我们发现类星体宿主星系星际介质的静力平衡状态与正常形成星系中气体平衡的结果类似，表明了类星体反馈的最低影响。关于非圆形运动被认为是类星体驱动的流出现象，我们观察到分子气体流出和活动星系核波尔博热光度之间的耦合效率异常低。这些结果表明中心引擎对类星体宿主星系中冷分子气体的性质影响较小。 <div>
We investigate the kinematics and dynamics of the molecular and ionized gas in the host galaxies of three Palomar-Green quasars at low redshifts, benefiting from the archival millimeter-wave interferometric and optical integral field unit data. We study the kinematics of both cold molecular and hot ionized gas by analyzing the CO and Hα data cubes, and construct the mass distributions of our sample through gas dynamics, utilizing a priori knowledge regarding the galaxy light distribution. We find no systematic offset between the stellar mass derived from our dynamical method and that from the broadband photometry and mass-to-light ratio, suggesting the consistency of both methods. We then study the kinetic pressure and the weight of the interstellar medium (ISM) using our dynamical mass model. By studying the relationship between kinetic pressure and gravitational pressure of the quasar host galaxies, we find an equivalence in the hydrostatic equilibrium states of ISM in the quasar host galaxies, similar to the result of gas equilibrium in normal star-forming galaxies, suggesting minimal quasar feedback. Regarding noncircular motion as indicative of quasar-driven outflows, we observe an exceptionally low coupling efficiency between molecular gas outflow and active galactic nucleus bolometric luminosities. These results demonstrate the marginal influence of the central engine on the properties of cold molecular gas in quasar host galaxies.

We introduce Disk2Planet, a machine-learning-based tool to infer key parameters in disk–planet systems from observed protoplanetary disk structures. Disk2Planet takes as input the disk structures in the form of 2D density and velocity maps, and outputs disk and planet properties, that is, the Shakura–Sunyaev viscosity, the disk aspect ratio, the planet–star mass ratio, and the planet’s radius and azimuth. We integrate the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy, an evolutionary algorithm tailored for complex optimization problems, and the Protoplanetary Disk Operator Network, a neural network designed to predict solutions of disk–planet interactions. Our tool is fully automated and can retrieve parameters in one system in 3 minutes on an Nvidia A100 graphics processing unit. We empirically demonstrate that our tool achieves percent-level or higher accuracy, and is able to handle missing data and unknown levels of noise.

<div> 重复快速无线电爆发（FRBs），持久射电源（PRSs），CHIME/FRB重复器，多波段分析，星际中心引擎
<br /><br />总结:
这篇文章对37个CHIME/FRB重复器进行了系统性的射电源搜索，通过多波段分析，确认了两个潜在的持久射电源（20181030A-S1和20190417A-S1），但在绝大多数情况下并未找到相关的持久射电源。文章进一步提出了对与重复FRB相关的亮度低的持久射电源数量的限制。此外，该研究还对PRS候选者的来源进行了分析，并提出了未来观测的需求。 <div>
The identification of persistent radio sources (PRSs) coincident with two repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) supports FRB theories requiring a compact central engine. However, deep nondetections in other cases highlight the diversity of repeating FRBs and their local environments. Here, we perform a systematic search for radio sources towards 37 CHIME/FRB repeaters using their arcminute localizations and a combination of archival surveys and targeted observations. Through multiwavelength analysis of individual radio sources, we identify two (20181030A-S1 and 20190417A-S1) for which we disfavor an origin of either star formation or an active galactic nucleus in their host galaxies and thus consider them candidate PRSs. We do not find any associated PRSs for the majority of the repeating FRBs in our sample. For eight FRB fields with Very Large Array imaging, we provide deep limits on the presence of PRSs that are 2–4 orders of magnitude fainter than the PRS associated with FRB 20121102A. Using Very Large Array Sky Survey imaging of all 37 fields, we constrain the rate of luminous (≳1040 erg s−1) PRSs associated with repeating FRBs to be low. Within the context of FRB-PRS models, we find that 20181030A-S1 and 20190417A-S1 can be reasonably explained within the context of magnetar, hypernebulae, gamma-ray burst afterglow, or supernova ejecta models—although we note that both sources follow the radio luminosity versus rotation measure relationship predicted in the nebula model framework. Future observations will be required to both further characterize and confirm the association of these PRS candidates with the FRBs.

<title>Expanding the Inventory of Molecule-rich Planetary Nebulae: New Observations of M4-17, Hu 1-1, M1-59, and Na 2</title>

HNC, CCH, and CN are prevalent molecules in the four planetary nebulae, with fractional abundances of f ∼ 0.9–7.5 × 10−7. Elliptical PNe like Hu 1-1 have a diverse molecular composition, while the late PN stage Na 2 also contains CN, CCH, and HCO+ with comparable abundances to younger PNe, indicating the maintenance of molecular content. The study suggests that elliptical PNe can have a diverse molecular composition and demonstrates the presence of distinct molecular species in the late PN stage.<br /><br />总结:<br />本研究观察了M4-17、Hu 1-1、M1-59和Na 2四个行星状星云的分子情况，并发现了丰富的分子成分。其中CN、CCH和HCO+为主要分子，并且在各个行星状星云中的丰度相当。椭圆形行星状星云（如Hu 1-1）的分子组成多样，而晚期的Na 2也含有CN、CCH和HCO+，且与年轻的行星状星云相比丰度相似，表明分子成分在晚期行星状星云阶段得以保持。 <div>
Molecular observations of four planetary nebulae (PNe), M4-17, Hu 1-1, M1-59, and Na 2, were conducted at 1–3 mm using the Arizona Radio Observatory’s 12 m antenna and Submillimeter Telescope, and the Institut de Radioastronomie Millimétrique 30 m Telescope. Toward M4-17, HNC (J = 3 → 2), CCH (N = 2 → 1, N = 3 → 2), CN (N = 1 → 0, N = 2 → 1), H2CO (JKa,Kc = 21,2 → 11,1, JKa,Kc = 20,2 → 10,1, JKa,Kc = 21,1 → 11,0), CS (J = 3 → 2, J = 5 → 4), and H13CN (J = 2 → 1) were detected. An almost identical set of transitions was identified toward Hu 1-1. Moreover, c–C3H2 was detected in Hu 1-1 via three 2 mm lines: JKa,Kc = 31,2 → 22,1, JKa,Kc = 41,4 → 30,3, and JKa,Kc = 32, 2 → 21,1. HNC, CCH, CN, CS, and H13CN were found in M1-59, as well as H2S via its JKa,Kc = 11,0 → 10,1 line—the first detection of this key sulfur species in PNe. In addition, CCH and CN were identified in the 27,000 yr old Na 2. Among these four sources, CN and CCH were the most prevalent molecules (after CO and H2) with fractional abundances, relative to H2, of f ∼ 0.9–7.5 × 10−7 and 0.8–7.5 × 10−7, respectively. CS and HNC have abundances in the range f ∼ 0.5–5 × 10−8, the latter resulting in HCN/HNC ∼ 3 across all three PNe. The unusual species H2CO, c–C3H2, and H2S had f ∼ 3–4 × 10−7, 10−8, and 6 × 10−8. This study suggests that elliptical PNe such as Hu 1-1 can have a diverse molecular composition. The presence of CN, CCH, and HCO+ in Na 2, with comparable abundances to younger PNe, demonstrates that molecular content is maintained into the late PN stage.

<div> 关键词: 星际耀斑, 磁能量, 前主序星, Orion星云, 多波段观测

总结:
本研究对前主序星的磁能量驱动的最强星际耀斑进行了观测和分析。研究团队利用Chandra望远镜观测到了Orion星云中大量的耀斑现象。此外，还进行了多波段观测，并分析了2003年至2016年的数据，得出了以下结论：1.报道了多个目标星的恒星休眠和耀斑X射线特性，有助于进行多波段分析。2.首次报告了中等能量耀斑与恒星质量/大小（存在/不存在盘）之间的相关性（或缺乏相关性）。3.大多数前主序星都表现出轻微的长期基线变化，这表明了固有的磁力学周期的缺失或者长期观测对前主序星X射线的影响。4.得出结论，X射线超级耀斑是前主序星中普遍现象，这表明所有原行星盘和新生行星都会受到高能辐射的影响。 <br /><br /> <div>
The most powerful stellar flares driven by magnetic energy occur during the early pre-main-sequence (PMS) phase. The Orion Nebula represents the nearest region populated by young stars, showing the greatest number of flares accessible to a single pointing of Chandra. This study is part of a multi-observatory project to explore stellar surface magnetic fields (with the Hobby–Eberly Telescope Habitable-zone Planet Finder, HET-HPF), particle ejections (with the Very Long Baseline Array, VLBA), and disk ionization (with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, ALMA) immediately following the detection of PMS superflares with Chandra. In 2023 December, we successfully conducted such a multi-telescope campaign. Additionally, by analyzing Chandra data from 2003, 2012, and 2016, we examine the multi-epoch behavior of PMS X-ray emission related to PMS magnetic cyclic activity and ubiquitous versus sample-confined megaflaring. Our findings are as follows. (1) We report detailed stellar quiescent and flare X-ray properties for numerous HET/ALMA/VLBA targets, facilitating ongoing multiwavelength analyses. (2) For numerous moderately energetic flares, we report correlations (or lack thereof) between flare energies and stellar mass/size (presence/absence of disks) for the first time. The former is attributed to the correlation between convection-driven dynamo and stellar volume, while the latter suggests the operation of solar-type flare mechanisms in PMS stars. (3) We find that most PMS stars exhibit minor long-term baseline variations, indicating the absence of intrinsic magnetic dynamo cycles or observational mitigation of cycles by saturated PMS X-rays. (4) We conclude that X-ray megaflares are ubiquitous phenomena in PMS stars, which suggests that all protoplanetary disks and nascent planets are subject to violent high-energy emission and particle irradiation events.

Small-scale brightenings are ubiquitous, dynamic, and energetic phenomena found in the chromosphere. An advanced filter-detection algorithm applied to high-resolution observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph enables the detection of these brightenings close to the noise level. This algorithm also tracks the movement of these brightenings and extracts their characteristics. This work outlines the results of an in-depth analysis of a quiet-Sun data set including a comparison of a brighter domain—associated with a supergranular boundary—to the quiescent internetwork domains. Several characteristics of brightenings from both domains are extracted and analysed, providing a range of sizes, durations, brightness values, travel distances, and speeds. The “active” quiet-Sun events tend to travel shorter distances and at slower speeds across the plane of the sky than their “true” quiet-Sun counterparts. These results are consistent with the magnetic field model of supergranular photospheric structures and the magnetic canopy model of the chromosphere above. Spectroscopic analyses reveal that bright points demonstrate blueshift (as well as some bidirectionality) and that they may rise from the chromosphere into the transition region. We believe that these bright points are magnetic in nature, are likely the result of magnetic reconnection, and follow current sheets between magnetic field gradients, rather than travel along magnetic field lines themselves.

<div> 关键词: 太阳风等离子体，电子群分布，电子准热噪声，电子密度和温度，库仑参数

总结:<br />
本文研究了太阳风等离子体中的电子群分布，发现可以用一个由麦克斯韦分布的核心和基于kappa分布的晕带的电子群模型来描述。通过计算不同日心径距离下的电子准热噪声的功率谱，揭示了这种噪声在频谱上的特点和有效的德拜长度随模型参数变化的依赖性。研究结果表明，电子准热噪声谱包括低频段（f < fpt）的平台、总等离子体频率 fpt处的峰值以及高频段（f > fpt）的急剧下降部分。随着日心径距离的增加，噪声的峰值和平台水平不断下降，峰值的形状也会因为kappa指数的变化而改变。尽管模型参数可以变化，但在实际情况下，这些参数的变化对于平台水平的影响不大，而当参数接近实际情况时，平台只显示出单调变化。这些结果对于未来内太阳风区域的深空探测以及探测器的设计具有重要的参考价值。 <div>
The electron population in the solar wind plasma can be described with three different components: a core, a halo, and a magnetic field aligned strahl. The electron quasi-thermal noise (QTN) is investigated by using an electron population model consisting of a core with a Maxwellian distribution and a halo with a kappa distribution, based on the empirical equations for electron density and temperature and the index for the kappa halo. The power spectra of the electron QTN are calculated at different heliocentric radial distances from 10 to 200 Rs. The dependence of the QTN spectrum and effective Debye length on model parameters, including the ratio of the halo to the core for the density and temperature, the kappa index, and the antenna length, is further discussed. The results show that the electron QTN spectrum consists of a plateau in the low-frequency band f < fpt, a peak at the total plasma frequency fpt, and a rapidly decreasing part in the high-frequency band f > fpt. The QTN peak and plateau level continuously decrease as the radial distance increases, with the peak’s shape changing due to the variation of the kappa index. Although the model parameters are variable, the QTN plateau level presents less than an order of change with these parameters changing greatly, and only a monotonic change of the plateau is shown when the parameters are close to the practical situation. The results can provide a reference for future deep-space exploration in the inner heliosphere, and also for the design of detectors.

总结: 
本文研究了银河球状星团中的两类主要恒星，即原始恒星和污染恒星。研究发现，原始恒星比例与星团的质量呈负相关，而与污染恒星的质量呈强负相关。同时发现，对于给定的原始恒星比例，大麦哲伦星云中的星团比小麦哲伦星云中的星团更大，这与银河的外部和内部的行星族星团的表现相反。研究者提出了星团形成条件可能导致这种差异。最后，研究者对单一恒星族星团NGC 419和Rup 106是否形成为多星族星团提出了质疑。 <br /><br /> <div>
Galactic globular clusters contain two main groups of stars, the pristine or 1P stars, and the polluted or 2P stars. The pristine-star fraction in clusters, F1P, is a decreasing function of the cluster present-day mass, mprst. Paper I has introduced a model mapping the region of the (mprst, F1P) space occupied by clusters, with the cluster mass threshold for 2P-star formation a key building block. We now expand this model to the pristine-star fraction in dependence of the pristine- and polluted-population masses. A. P. Milone et al. found that F1P anticorrelates more tightly with the polluted-population present-day mass, m2P,prst, than with the cluster total mass, mprst. By contrast, F1P anticorrelates poorly with the pristine-population current mass, m1P,prst. We show the loose anticorrelation between F1P and m1P,prst to result from a roughly constant pristine-population mass in clusters as they start their long-term evolution in the Galactic tidal field. As for the tight anticorrelation between m2P,prst and F1P, it stems from the initially shallow relation between m2P and F1P. Clusters of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC, respectively) appear to behave unexpectedly with respect to each other. For a given F1P, LMC clusters are more massive than SMC clusters despite their enduring a stronger tidal field. This is opposite to how the Galactic outer- and inner-halo clusters behave. The explanation may lie in cluster formation conditions. Finally, we wonder whether the single-population clusters NGC 419 and Rup 106 formed as multiple-population clusters.

Dark matter (DM) bars that shadow stellar bars have been previously shown to form in idealized simulations of isolated disk galaxies, but have yet to be studied in a fully cosmological context. In this work, we analyze a population of disk galaxies within the TNG50 simulation to determine the characteristics of their dark bars. We estimate bar strength and orientation using both the in-plane Fourier A2 density moments and the quadrupolar coefficients of the spherical harmonic basis function expansions of the density. We additionally present two novel methods for measuring the bar pattern speed Ωp and rotation axis orientation using these coefficients, and apply them to one sample galaxy located in a TNG50 subbox. Consistent with isolated simulations, DM bars are shorter than their stellar counterparts and are 75% weaker in A2. DM bars dominate the shape of the inner halo potential and are apparent in the time series of quadrupolar coefficients. In our selected subbox galaxy, the stellar and dark bars remain co-aligned throughout the last 8 Gyr and have identical Ωp. Pattern speed Ωp evolves considerably over the last 8 Gyr, consistent with torques on the bars due to dynamical friction and gas accretion, and is seen to increase following a merger at tlb = 1.5 Gyr. Rather than remaining static in time, the bar rotation axis displays both precession and nutation possibly caused by torques outside the plane of rotation. We find that the shape of the stellar and DM mass distributions are tightly correlated with Ωp.

太阳任务对太阳等离子体组成的测量至关重要。然而，在确定太阳大气中第一电离势效应的大小方面，密度和温度不敏感的光谱诊断比率很少。本文评估了Fe viii 185.213 Å/Ne viii 770.428 Å强度比率，发现它对温度和密度相当不敏感，因此原则上可用于分析轨道上的EUV光谱。实验结果表明，该诊断方法可以提供准确的结果，并且在对太阳冠层各个地方的变化幅度内小于10%-14%。作者还将该诊断应用于2023年3月的协同观测，并展示了SPICE和EIS的组合可以测量每个地方的Fe/Ne FIP偏差。结果显示，主导极性和衰减极性之间的FIP偏差上升与Solar Orbiter/Solar Wind Analyser对Fe/O的原位测量大致一致。多空间器的协同观测虽然复杂，但这一诊断方法也在Solar-C/Extreme UltraViolet高吞吐量光谱望远镜的波段计划内。 <br /><br />总结: 太阳任务对太阳等离子体组成的测量至关重要。本文评估了Fe viii/Ne viii 强度比率，在温度和密度不敏感范围内有其实用性。实验结果表明该诊断方法准确性高，在协同观测中也能得到好的效果。研究还表明Fe/Ne FIP偏差存在差别，并能与其他测量技术相互印证。 <div>
Plasma composition measurements are a vital tool for the success of current and future solar missions, but density- and temperature-insensitive spectroscopic diagnostic ratios are sparse, and their underlying accuracy in determining the magnitude of the first ionization potential (FIP) effect in the solar atmosphere remains an open question. Here we assess the Fe viii 185.213 Å/Ne viii 770.428 Å intensity ratio that can be observed as a multispacecraft combination between Solar Orbiter/SPICE and Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS). We find that it is fairly insensitive to temperature and density in the range of log (T/K) = 5.65–6.05 and is therefore useful, in principle, for analyzing on-orbit EUV spectra. We also perform an empirical experiment, using Hinode/EIS measurements of coronal fan loop temperature distributions weighted by randomly generated FIP bias values, to show that our diagnostic method can provide accurate results as it recovers the input FIP bias to within 10%–14%. This is encouraging since it is smaller than the magnitude of variations seen throughout the solar corona. We apply the diagnostic to coordinated observations from 2023 March and show that the combination of SPICE and EIS allows measurements of the Fe/Ne FIP bias in the regions where the footpoints of the magnetic field connected to Solar Orbiter are predicted to be located. The results show an increase in FIP bias between the main leading polarity and the trailing decayed polarity that broadly agrees with Fe/O in situ measurements from Solar Orbiter/Solar Wind Analyser. Multispacecraft coordinated observations are complex, but this diagnostic also falls within the planned wavebands for Solar-C/Extreme UltraViolet high-throughput Spectroscopic Telescope.

质量对β的影响在亚晕中最为显著，而在晕内恒星中最弱。此外，β在中心区域受M200影响而向各向同性转化，这要归因于宇宙学的影响。<br />
此外，随着c200的增加，晕内恒星和暗物质的β也变得更趋向于径向。暗物质粒子比亚晕更趋向于径向。这些差异可以解释为亚晕在更径向的轨道上更易被剥离，贡献更多的恒星和暗物质。<br />
最后，研究给出了在rs<3rs范围内晕内恒星和暗物质β差异的拟合公式。 <div>
We investigate the mass (M200) and concentration (c200) dependencies of the velocity anisotropy (β) profiles for different components in the dark matter halo—including halo stars, dark matter, and subhalos—using systems from the IllustrisTNG simulations. Beyond a critical radius, β becomes more radial with the increase of M200, reflecting more prominent radial accretion around massive halos. The critical radius is r ∼ rs, 0.3 rs, and rs for halo stars, dark matter, and subhalos, with rs being the scale radius of the host halos. This dependence on M200 is the strongest for subhalos and the weakest for halo stars. In central regions, the β of halo stars and dark matter particles get more isotropic with the increase of M200 in TNG300 due to baryons. By contrast, the β of dark matter from the dark-matter-only TNG300-Dark run shows much weaker dependence on M200 within rs. Dark matter in TNG300 is slightly more isotropic than in TNG300-Dark at 0.2 rs < r < 10 rs and . Halo stars and dark matter also become more radial with the increase in c200, at fixed M200. Halo stars are more radial than the β profile of dark matter by approximately a constant beyond rs. Dark matter particles are more radial than subhalos. The differences can be understood, as subhalos on more radial orbits are more easily stripped, contributing more stars and dark matter to the diffuse components. We provide the fitting formula for the differences between the β of halo stars and dark matter at rs < r < 3 rs as for and as βstar − βDM = 0.328 for .

<div> 关键词: Kinetic Alfvén waves, ion cyclotron waves, solar wind heating, hybrid simulations, ion beam mode <br />
总结: 本研究使用混合模拟提出了一种新的太阳风等离子体中KAWs和平行ICWs的生成场景。结果显示，通过离子束模式触发，KAWs和平行ICWs的生成与初始背景质子β值呈反相关关系，其增长速率显著高于离子束模式。此外，这些触发的波动的饱和能量可与离子束模式相媲美。这一触发过程解释了KAWs和平行ICWs的起源以及它们在束流等离子体环境中共存的可信原因。<br /><br /> <div>
Kinetic Alfvén waves (KAWs) and ion cyclotron waves (ICWs) are believed to play a significant role in the solar wind heating and acceleration and are pervasive in space and astrophysical plasmas. However, the generation mechanism for the coexistence of both wave modes remains unclear. The present work proposes a novel generation scenario of KAWs and parallel ICWs in a homogeneous solar wind plasma using hybrid simulations. Our numerical study reveals that the emissions of KAWs and parallel ICWs can be triggered by the ion beam (IB) mode in a homogeneous alpha or proton beam plasma with a beam velocity of ≥1.2vA for alpha particles or ≥1.6vA for proton beams, where vA represents the local Alfvén velocity. The growth rates of both KAWs and parallel ICWs are significantly higher than that of the IB mode. Moreover, the initial background proton beta exhibits an inverse correlation with the growth of KAWs. Ultimately, the saturation energy of these triggered emissions could rival that of the IB mode. Given the prevalent occurrence of IBs in the solar wind, this triggering process provides a credible explanation for the origin of KAWs and parallel ICWs and their coexistence within the beam plasma environments.

该研究使用了多个航天器的观测和数值模拟，以研究2021年12月4日的CME事件及其旋转情况。研究发现，CME在太阳日冕内部呈现近似直线运动，但在星际空间中出现逐渐改变轴向和旋转的情况。CME的不同部分受到不同速度太阳风的影响，导致磁结构产生非对称位移，进而在星际空间发生旋转。此外，在CME的右侧存在一个共转互作用区，也会导致CME的方向发生变化和偏离轨道。这些结果为解释CME在太阳圈层内的运动和结构提供了新的见解。

The magnetic orientation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is of great importance to understand their space weather effects. Although plenty of evidence suggests that CMEs can undergo significant rotation during the early phases of evolution in the solar corona, there are few reports that CMEs rotate in the interplanetary space. In this work, we use multispacecraft observations and a numerical simulation starting from the lower corona close to the solar surface to understand the CME event on 2021 December 4, with an emphatic investigation of its rotation. This event is observed as a partial halo CME from the back side of the Sun by coronagraphs and reaches the BepiColombo spacecraft and the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN/Tianwen-1 as a magnetic flux-rope-like structure. The simulation discloses that in the solar corona the CME is approximately a translational motion, while the interplanetary propagation process evidences a gradual change of axis orientation of the CME’s flux-rope-like structure. It is also found that the downside and the right flank of the CME moves with the fast solar wind, and the upside does in the slow-speed stream. The different parts of the CME with different speeds generate the nonidentical displacements of its magnetic structure, resulting in the rotation of the CME in the interplanetary space. Furthermore, at the right flank of the CME exists a corotating interaction region, which makes the orientation of the CME alter and also deviates from its route due to the CME. These results provide new insight into interpreting CMEs’ dynamics and structures during their traveling through the heliosphere.

<div> 开普勒-7b，PICASO，大气散射，反射光，云层

总结:
开普勒-7b是一个热木星，其大气模型通过PICASO模拟了三种云层的反射光相位曲线。模拟结果显示，含有三种云凝结物种类以及低沉降效率（0.03-0.1）的模型与开普勒观测数据最匹配。然而，模拟的反射光强度约为开普勒观测数据的三分之一。因此，需要更好地理解区域输送、云层辐射反馈和颗粒散射特性，才能解释模型和观测反射光通量之间的差异。 <div>
Examining reflected light from exoplanets aids in our understanding of the scattering properties of their atmospheres and will be a primary task of future flagship space- and ground-based telescopes. We introduce an enhanced capability of Planetary Intensity Code for Atmospheric Scattering Observations (PICASO), an open-source radiative transfer model used for exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres, to produce reflected light phase curves from three-dimensional atmospheric models. Since PICASO is coupled to the cloud code Virga, we produce phase curves for different cloud condensate species and varying sedimentation efficiencies (fsed) and apply this new functionality to Kepler-7b, a hot Jupiter with phase curve measurements dominated by reflected starlight. We model three different cloud scenarios for Kepler-7b: MgSiO3 clouds only, Mg2SiO4 clouds only, and Mg2SiO4, Al2O3, and TiO2 clouds. All our Virga models reproduce the cloudy region west of the substellar point expected from previous studies, as well as clouds at high latitudes and near the eastern limb, which are primarily composed of magnesium silicates. Al2O3 and TiO2 clouds dominate near the substellar point. We then compare our modeled reflected light phase curves to Kepler observations and find that models with all three cloud condensate species and low sedimentation efficiencies (0.03–0.1) match best, though our reflected light phase curves show intensities approximately one-third of those observed by Kepler. We conclude that a better understanding of zonal transport, cloud radiative feedback, and particle scattering properties is needed to further explain the differences between the modeled and observed reflected light fluxes.

总结:
该研究提出了一个自洽的模型，用于解释来自冲击加热等离子体的热X射线辐射，该模型考虑了温度和电离非平衡条件。他们通过同时求解温度和电离的弛豫过程来计算每个元素的温度和电离态的时间演变。通过与nei模型的比较，发现nei模型低估了离子化时间尺度约30％。研究人员将该模型应用于SNR N132D的Chandra数据，提供了冲击波速度约800 km s-1的约束，与先前的光学研究结果一致。<br /><br /> <div>
X-ray observations of shock-heated plasmas, such as those found in supernova remnants (SNRs), often exhibit features of temperature and ionization nonequilibrium. For accurate interpretation of these observations, proper calculations of the equilibration processes are essential. Here, we present a self-consistent model of thermal X-ray emission from shock-heated plasmas that accounts for both temperature and ionization nonequilibrium conditions. For a given pair of shock velocity and initial electron-to-ion temperature ratio, the temporal evolution of the temperature and ionization state of each element was calculated by simultaneously solving the relaxation processes of temperature and ionization. The resulting thermal X-ray spectrum was synthesized by combining our model with the AtomDB spectral code. Comparison between our model and the nei model, a constant-temperature nonequilibrium ionization model available in the XSPEC software package, reveals a 30% underestimation of the ionization timescale in the nei model. We implemented our model in XSPEC to directly constrain the shock wave’s properties, such as the shock velocity and collisionless electron heating efficiency, from the thermal X-ray emission from postshock plasmas. We applied this model to archival Chandra data of the SNR N132D, providing a constraint on the shock velocity of ∼800 km s−1, in agreement with previous optical studies.

<div> 关键词: Type II supernova, SN 2023ufx, metal-poor, dwarf galaxy, shock-cooling phase
总结:
该研究观测了在低金属量（Zhost ∼ 0.1 Z⊙）矮星系（Mg = −13.39 ± 0.16 mag，rproj ∼ 1 kpc）外围爆发的Type II超新星（SN II）SN 2023ufx。该超新星可能是目前观测到的金属含量最低的SN II。爆发光度高，达到Mg ≈ −18.5 mag，且演化迅速。光度曲线显示有一个持续20天（shock-cooling phase）和一个持续19天（plateau）的阶段。整个光学厚相持续时间仅约55天，表明红超巨前体在爆发前的H外壳已经减少。早期光谱未显示狭窄发射特征，限制了爆发前的质量损失率。光谱缺乏明显的金属吸收特征，表明前体金属丰度≲0.1 Z⊙。模拟结果显示金属贫穷的SN II可能具有与附近金属丰富的SN II不同的性质。这些观测奠定了对早期宇宙中金属贫穷SN II的建模基础。 <div>
We present extensive observations of the Type II supernova (SN II) SN 2023ufx, which is likely the most metal-poor SN II observed to date. It exploded in the outskirts of a low-metallicity (Zhost ∼ 0.1 Z⊙) dwarf (Mg = −13.39 ± 0.16 mag, rproj ∼ 1 kpc) galaxy. The explosion is luminous, peaking at Mg ≈ −18.5 mag, and shows rapid evolution. The r-band (pseudobolometric) light curve has a shock-cooling phase lasting 20 (17) days followed by a 19 (23) day plateau. The entire optically thick phase lasts only ≈55 days following explosion, indicating that the red supergiant progenitor had a thinned H envelope prior to explosion. The early spectra obtained during the shock-cooling phase show no evidence for narrow emission features and limit the preexplosion mass-loss rate to M⊙ yr−1. The photospheric-phase spectra are devoid of prominent metal absorption features, indicating a progenitor metallicity of ≲0.1 Z⊙. The seminebular (∼60–130 days) spectra reveal weak Fe ii, but other metal species typically observed at these phases (Ti ii, Sc ii, and Ba ii) are conspicuously absent. The late-phase optical and near-infrared spectra also reveal broad (≈104 km s−1) double-peaked Hα, Pβ, and Pγ emission profiles suggestive of a fast outflow launched during the explosion. Outflows are typically attributed to rapidly rotating progenitors, which also prefer metal-poor environments. This is only the second SN II with ≲0.1 Z⊙ and both exhibit peculiar evolution, suggesting a sizable fraction of metal-poor SNe II have distinct properties compared to nearby metal-enriched SNe II. These observations lay the groundwork for modeling the metal-poor SNe II expected in the early Universe.

<div> Hubble Tension, Hubble constant, TRGB, Cepheid variables, JWST <br />
总结:<br />
本研究旨在解决哈勃张力问题，通过比较不同标准烛光方法测定的星系距离，发现I 波段的TRGB测量与Cepheids测量无显著差异。通过使用JWST观测结果作为几何锚点，提供了对HST测量方法的重要系统交叉检查。然而，由于样本量较小，目前还无法与HST样本竞争。 <div>
The Hubble Tension, a >5σ discrepancy between direct and indirect measurements of the Hubble constant (H0), has persisted for a decade and motivated intense scrutiny of the paths used to infer H0. Comparing independently derived distances for a set of galaxies with different standard candles, such as the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) and Cepheid variables, can test for systematics in the middle rung of the distance ladder. The I band is the preferred filter for measuring the TRGB due to constancy with color, a result of low sensitivity to population differences in age and metallicity supported by stellar models. We use James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations with the maser host NGC 4258 as our geometric anchor to measure I-band (F090W versus F090W − F150W) TRGB distances to eight hosts of 10 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) within 28 Mpc: NGC 1448, NGC 1559, NGC 2525, NGC 3370, NGC 3447, NGC 5584, NGC 5643, and NGC 5861. We compare these with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Cepheid-based relative distance moduli for the same galaxies and anchor. We find no evidence of a difference between their weighted means, 0.01 ± 0.04 (stat) ± 0.04 (sys) mag. We produce 14 variants of the TRGB analysis, altering the smoothing level and color range used to measure the tips to explore their impact. For some hosts, this changes the identification of the strongest peak, but this causes little change to the sample mean difference, producing a full range of 0.00–0.02 mag, all consistent at 1σ with no difference. The result matches past comparisons of I-band TRGB and Cepheids when both use HST. SNe and anchor samples observed with JWST are too small to yield a measure of H0 that is competitive with the HST sample of 42 SNe Ia and 4 anchors; however, they already provide a vital systematic cross-check to HST measurements of the distance ladder.

<div> 关键词: NGC 4151, 变化型活动星系核, 宽线区域, 时间滞后, 光度变化
总结:
NGC 4151是一个变化型活动星系核，通过四年的速度分辨重映射测量，确认了一个符合光电离模型预测的分层宽线区域结构。研究发现了一个“反呼吸”现象，即随着光度增加，宽谱线的时间滞后减小，与预期相反。此现象可能是由于紫外-光学滞后或宽线区域气体非维里化运动的影响。同时，速度分辨重映射和电离映射分析揭示了宽线区域几何形状和动力学的快速和显著变化，这些变化在不到一年的时间内发生，无法用任何单一机制解释。另外，NGC 4151和其他变化型活动星系核的Hβ滞后与低吸积率星系核的半径-光度关系一致，表明变化型活动星系核现象更可能是由内在吸积率的变化而不是遮挡所驱动。这些发现为理解变化型活动星系核的复杂内部过程提供了新的见解，并强调了长期、多线重映射对理解宽线区域结构、几何形状和动力学的重要性。 <div>
We present the results of a four-year velocity-resolved reverberation mapping (RM) campaign of the changing-look active galactic nucleus (CL-AGN) NGC 4151 during its outburst phase. By measuring the time lags of the Hα, Hβ, Hγ, He i, and He ii emission lines, we confirm a stratified broad-line region (BLR) structure that aligns with predictions from photoionization models. Intriguingly, we observed an “anti-breathing” phenomenon, where the lags of broad emission lines decreased with increasing luminosity, contrary to the typical expectation. This anomaly may be attributed to the influence of the ultraviolet-optical lag or nonvirialized motions in the BLR gas. Velocity-resolved RM and ionization mapping analyses revealed rapid and significant changes in the BLR geometry and kinematics on timescales of less than a year, which cannot be interpreted by any single mechanism, such as an inhomogeneous BLR, variations in radiation pressure, or changes in the illuminated ionizing field. Additionally, the Hβ lags of NGC 4151 and other CL-AGNs agree with the radius–luminosity relationship established for AGNs with low accretion rates, implying that the CL phenomenon is more likely driven by intrinsic changes in the accretion rate rather than obscuration. These findings provide new insights into the complex internal processes of CL-AGNs and highlight the importance of long-term, multiline RM for understanding BLR structures, geometry, and kinematics.

这篇研究提出了一个新的铁（Fe）和α元素（Ca，Mg，Ti，Si）的原子光谱线列表，用于改进利用近红外（NIR）光谱进行恒星参数确定。通过对太阳和其类似恒星HD 76151的高分辨率和高质量的近红外光谱进行验证，得出了HD 76151的有效温度、表面重力和金属丰度的数值。通过与PARSEC等时线模型的比较，确定了HD 76151的质量、半径和年龄。此外，使用Gaia天文和光谱数据进行了HD 76151的运动和动力学轨道分析，结果表明该恒星是太阳圆内一个金属丰富区域的成员。这一分析结果与光谱分析反映的恒星略微富金属的性质是一致的。 <div>
Determining the physical nature of a star requires precise knowledge of its stellar atmospheric parameters, including effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity. This study presents a new atomic line list covering a broad spectral range (1–2.5 μm; YJHK bands) for iron (Fe) and α-elements (Ca, Mg, Ti, Si) to improve stellar parameter determination using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. We highlight the limitations of existing line lists, stemming primarily from inconsistencies in oscillator strengths for ionized iron lines within the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment DR17. The line list was validated using the high-resolution and high-quality disk-center NIR spectra of the Sun and its solar analog HD 76151. As a result of the spectroscopic analyses, the effective temperature of HD 76151 was calculated as 5790 ± 170 K, surface gravity as 4.35 ± 0.18 cgs, metal abundance as 0.24 ± 0.09 dex, and microturbulence velocity of km s−1 by combining the optical and NIR line lists. A comparison of the model atmospheric parameters calculated for HD 76151 with the PARSEC isochrones resulted in a stellar mass of , radius , and an age of Gyr. For the first time, kinematic and dynamical orbital analyses of HD 76151 using a combination of Gaia astrometric and spectroscopic data showed that the star was born in a metal-rich region within the solar circle and is a member of the thin disk population. Thus, the slightly metal-rich nature of the star, as reflected in its spectroscopic analysis, was confirmed by dynamical orbital analysis.

总结: 
本文研究了伽马射线暴（GRB）的中微子发射机制以及探测前景。通过选择四个特殊的GRB事件，采用两种不同类型的射流组成，作者发现只有GRB 211211A事件可以通过耗散光球模型得到良好的约束。但对于内部碰撞诱导的磁重连接和湍流（ICMART）模型，对GRB 230307A和GRB 080916C无法有效约束。此外，作者还调查了来自GRB的高能中微子的探测前景，并发现即使在IceCube-Gen2操作期间，也很难从ICMART模型中探测到与GRB相关的高能中微子。然而，对于类似GRB 211211A的事件，在IceCube-Gen2操作期间，如果这样的事件来源于光球耗散内的紧凑恒星合并，可能会探测到与引力波同时发生的至少一个中微子。 <br /><br /> <div>
The prompt emission mechanism of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is a long-standing open question, and GRBs have been considered as potential sources of high-energy neutrinos. Despite many years of search for the neutrino events associated with GRBs from IceCube, there were no results. However, the absence of search results for neutrinos provides a unique opportunity to constrain the parameter space of GRB jet models. In this paper, we chose four peculiar GRBs with two different types of jet composition to investigate neutrino emission. It is found that only GRB 211211A could be well constrained within the dissipative photosphere model. By adopting the specific parameters of the photosphere, one can obtain εp/εe < 8 for fp > 0.2 from GRB 211211A. For the Internal-collision-induced Magnetic Reconnection and Turbulence (ICMART) model, we can effectively constrain neither GRB 230307A nor GRB 080916C. Moreover, we also investigate the detection prospects of high-energy neutrinos from GRBs and find that it is difficult to detect at least one high-energy neutrino associated with GRBs from the ICMART model even during the IceCube-Gen2 operation. For the GRB 211211A-like events, it is possible to detect at least one neutrino coincident with the gravitational wave during the IceCube-Gen2 operation, if such an event originated from mergers of compact stars within the photosphere dissipation.

总结:<br /><br />这篇论文研究了质子-回旋仪不稳定性并使用速度矩理论来分析物理过程。研究表明，速度矩理论在较为接近稳定状态时略微夸大了温度各向异性的放松，但仍然是有效的。同时，通过粒子-在-单元和混合码模拟结果的验证，论文证明了速度矩理论作为PC不稳定性的高效理论工具的合理性。 <div>
The proton-cyclotron (PC) instability operates in various space plasma environments. In the literature, the so-called velocity moment-based quasi-linear theory is employed to investigate the physical process of PC instability that takes place after the onset of early linear exponential growth. In this method, the proton velocity distribution function (VDF) is assumed to maintain a bi-Maxwellian form for all time, which substantially simplifies the analysis, but its validity has not been rigorously examined by comparing against the actual solution of the kinetic equation. The present paper relaxes the assumption of the velocity moment-based quasi-linear theory by actually solving for the velocity space diffusion equation under the assumption of separable perpendicular and parallel VDFs, and upon comparison with the simplified velocity moment theory, it demonstrates that the simplified method is largely valid, despite the fact that the method slightly overemphasizes the relaxation of temperature anisotropy when the system is close to the marginally stable state. The overall validation is further confirmed with the results of particle-in-cell and hybrid-code simulations. The present paper thus provides a justification for making use of the velocity moment-based quasi-linear theory as an efficient first-cut theoretical tool for the PC instability.

Boomerang星云是由能量充沛的脉冲星PSR J2229+6114提供动力的明亮射电和X射线脉冲星风星云（PWN）。在考虑电子的对流和扩散传输的情况下，利用PWN的动力学演化模型对其X射线辐射进行建模，发现星云内的磁场比较弱，这意味着通过注入的电子/正电子对的逆康普顿（IC）辐射可能对Boomerang星云的UHEγ射线产生显著贡献。我们还讨论了先前研究的结果，并讨论了PWN可能的强子UHE辐射。 在我们的模型中，脉冲星大部分的自转耗散功率可能转化为热粒子或相对论质子。 <div>
The Boomerang Nebula is a bright radio and X-ray pulsar wind nebula (PWN) powered by an energetic pulsar, PSR J2229+6114. It is spatially coincident with one of the brightest ultrahigh-energy (UHE; ≥100 TeV) gamma-ray sources, LHAASO J2226+6057. While X-ray observations have provided radial profiles for both the intensity and photon index of the nebula, previous theoretical studies have not reached an agreement on their physical interpretation, which also leads to different anticipation of the UHE emission from the nebula. In this work, we model its X-ray emission with a dynamical evolution model of PWN, considering both convective and diffusive transport of electrons. On the premise of fitting the X-ray intensity and photon index profiles, we find that the magnetic field within the Boomerang Nebula is weak (∼10 μG in the core region and diminishing to 1 μG at the periphery), which therefore implies a significant contribution to the UHE gamma-ray emission by the inverse Compton (IC) radiation of injected electron/positron pairs. Depending on the particle transport mechanism, the UHE gamma-ray flux contributed by the Boomerang Nebula via the IC radiation may constitute about 10%–50% of the flux of LHAASO J2226+6057 at 100 TeV and up to 30% at 500 TeV. Finally, we compare our results with previous studies and discuss potential hadronic UHE emission from the PWN. In our modeling, most of the spindown luminosity of the pulsar may be transformed into thermal particles or relativistic protons.

总结:<br /><br />
这篇文章研究了银河系周围的卫星星系的六维相空间信息，并使用该信息计算了这些卫星星系在银河系和大麦哲伦云的共同引力作用下的轨道历史。研究发现，在考虑了大麦哲伦云的引力以及其相关卫星星系的群体入射后，银河系的径向分布随时间变得更加集中。文章还指出，与近期对类似银河系的系统的调查相比，银河系的径向分布在目前和1至2亿年前都更加集中。此外，研究还发现，与银河系质量的模拟宿主相比，银河系的径向分布也更加集中。最后，文章推测，模拟银河系质量的类似系统在有大麦哲伦云伴星的情况下，其径向分布很可能会与研究结果相似，表明一个巨大卫星星系及其卫星的加入会导致更加集中的径向分布。 <div>
The Milky Way (MW) is surrounded by dozens of satellite galaxies, with six-dimensional (6D) phase-space information measured for over 80% of this population. The spatial distribution of these satellites is an essential probe of galaxy formation and for mapping the MW’s underlying dark matter distribution. Using measured 6D phase-space information of known MW satellites, we calculate orbital histories in a joint MW+LMC potential, including the gravitational influence of the LMC on all satellites and on the MW’s center of mass, and dynamical friction owing to both galaxies, to investigate the evolution of the MW’s cumulative radial profile. We conclude that radial profiles become more concentrated over time when we consider the LMC’s gravitational influence and the group infall of LMC-associated satellites. The MW’s radial distribution is consistently more concentrated at the present day and 1 and 2 Gyr ago compared to recent surveys of nearby MW-like systems. Compared to MW-mass hosts in cosmological, zoom-in simulations, we find the MW’s radial profile is also more concentrated than those of simulated counterparts; however, some overlap exists between simulation results and our analysis of the MW’s satellite distribution 2 Gyr ago, pre-LMC infall. Finally, we posit that radial profiles of simulated MW-mass analogs also hosting an LMC companion are likely to evolve similarly to our results, such that the accretion of a massive satellite along with its satellites will lead to a more concentrated radial profile as the massive satellite advances toward its host galaxy.

<br /><br />本研究利用Swift卫星2004年至2019年的高红移样本，假设z ≥ 2的长伽玛射线暴（GRBs）都是坍缩星GRBs，利用断裂幂律形式构建了光度函数，并考虑了无演化、光度演化和密度演化三种情景。研究结果如下：（1）无演化模型可以被排除；（2）拟合结果表明，要充分解释观测结果，需要在红移上要么有显著的光度（演化指数）要么密度（）演化。这排除了长GRB的红移演化是由非坍缩星GRB的污染引起；（3）光度演化模型预测，z < 2且P ≥ 1 ph cm−2 s−1的坍缩星GRB数量为138.6，占观测到的这类GRB数量的82.5%；密度演化模型预测，这一数量为80.2，占观测数量的47.7%。无论采用何种模型，都有相当一部分长GRB并非坍缩星GRB。
<br /><br />总结: 本研究利用Swift卫星观测得出，长伽玛射线暴（GRBs）在高红移下的演化具有显著特征，需要考虑光度或密度演化模型。根据光度演化模型预测，某种类型的长GRBs在z < 2且P ≥ 1 ph cm−2 s−1的数量占观测总数的82.5%，而密度演化模型预测为47.7%。同时也发现，无论采用何种模型，都有相当一部分长GRBs不是坍缩星GRB。 <div>
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are powerful probes of the high-redshift Universe. However, the proportion of collapsar GRBs among long GRBs and their event rate relative to the star formation rate (SFR) remain contentious issues. We assume that long GRBs with z ≥ 2 are all collapsar GRBs and construct the luminosity function using a high-redshift sample from the Swift satellite spanning 2004 to 2019. We model the luminosity function with a broken power-law form and consider three scenarios: no evolution, luminosity evolution, and density evolution. Our results are as follows: (1) The no-evolution model can be ruled out. (2) The fitting results indicate that to adequately explain the observations, a significant redshift evolution in either luminosity (evolution index ) or density ( ) is required. This excludes the possibility that the evolution of long GRBs with redshift is due to contamination from noncollapsar GRBs. (3) The luminosity evolution model predicts that the number of collapsar GRBs with z < 2 and P ≥ 1 ph cm−2 s−1 is 138.6, accounting for 82.5% of the observed long GRBs with z < 2 and P ≥ 1 ph cm−2 s−1. The density evolution model predicts that the number of collapsar GRBs with z < 2 and P ≥ 1 ph cm−2 s−1 is 80.2, accounting for 47.7% of the observation. Regardless of the model, a substantial portion of the long GRBs are not collapsar GRBs.

<title>The SPT-Chandra BCG Spectroscopic Survey. I. Evolution of the Entropy Threshold for ICM Cooling and AGN Feedback in Galaxy Clusters over the Last 10 Gyr</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a multiwavelength study of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in a sample of the 95 most massive galaxy clusters selected from the South Pole Telescope Sunyaev–Zeldovich (SZ) survey. Our sample spans a redshift range of 0.3 < z < 1.7, and is complete with optical spectroscopy from various ground-based observatories, as well as ground and space-based imaging from optical, X-ray, and radio wave bands. At z ∼ 0, previous studies have shown a strong correlation between the presence of a low-entropy cool core and the presence of both star formation and radio-loud active galactic nuclei in the central BCG. We show for the first time that the central entropy threshold for triggering star formation, which is universally seen in nearby systems, persists out to z ∼ 1, with only marginal (∼1σ) evidence for evolution in the threshold entropy value itself. In contrast, we do not find a similar high-z analog for an entropy threshold for feedback, but instead measure a strong evolution in the fraction of radio-loud BCGs in high-entropy cores, decreasing with increasing redshift. This could imply that the cooling-feedback loop was not as tight in the past, or that some other fuel source like mergers are fueling the radio sources more often with increasing redshift, making the radio luminosity an increasingly unreliable proxy for radio jet power. We also find that our SZ-based sample is missing a small (∼4%) population of the most luminous radio sources (νLν > 1042 erg s−1), likely due to radio contamination suppressing the SZ signal with which these clusters are detected.

<title>Probing the Morphology of Polarized Emission Induced by Fluctuation Dynamo Using Minkowski Functionals</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The morphology and the characteristic scale of polarized structures provide crucial insights into the mechanisms that drive turbulence and maintain magnetic fields in magneto-ionic plasma. We aim to establish the efficacy of Minkowski functionals as quantitative statistical probes of filamentary morphology of polarized synchrotron emission resulting from fluctuation dynamo action. Using synthetic observations generated from magnetohydrodynamic simulations of fluctuation dynamos with varying driving scales (ℓf) of turbulence in isothermal, incompressible, and subsonic media, we study the relation between different morphological measures and their connection to fractional polarization (pf). We find that Faraday depolarization at low frequencies gives rise to small-scale polarized structures that have higher filamentarity as compared to the intrinsic structures that are comparable to ℓf. Above ∼3 GHz, the number of connected polarized structures per unit area (NCC,peak) is related to the mean pf (〈pf〉) of the emitting region as , provided the scale of the detectable emitting region is larger than ℓf. This implies that NCC,peak represents the number of turbulent cells projected on the plane of the sky and can be directly used to infer ℓf via the relation . An estimate of ℓf thus directly allows for pinning down the turbulence-driving mechanism in astrophysical systems. While the simulated conditions are mostly prevalent in the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters, the qualitative morphological features are also applicable in the context of interstellar medium in galaxies.

Semianalytic models (SAMs) systematically predict higher-stellar mass scatter at a given halo mass than hydrodynamical simulations and most empirical models. Our goal is to investigate the physical origin of this scatter by exploring modifications to the physics in the SAM Dark Sage. We design two black hole formation models that approximate results from the IllustrisTNG 300-1 hydrodynamical simulation. In the first model, we assign a fixed black hole mass of 106M⊙ to every halo that reaches 1010.5M⊙. In the second model, we disregard any black hole growth as implemented in the standard Dark Sage model. Instead, we force all black hole masses to follow the median z = 0 black hole mass–halo mass relation in IllustrisTNG 300-1 with an imposed fixed scatter. We find that each model on its own does not significantly reduce the scatter in stellar mass. To explore the effects of active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback in addition to black hole seeding, we replace the native Dark Sage AGN feedback model with a simple model where we turn off cooling for galaxies with black hole masses above 108M⊙. With the additional modification in AGN feedback, we find that the supermassive black hole seeding and fixed conditional distribution models create a significant reduction in the scatter in stellar mass at halo masses between 1011–14M⊙. These results suggest that AGN feedback in SAMs acts in a qualitatively different way than feedback implemented in cosmological simulations. Either or both may require substantial modification to match the empirically inferred scatter in the stellar mass–halo mass relation.

The cosmic expansion rate can be directly measured with gravitational-wave (GW) data of the compact binary mergers by jointly constraining the mass function of the population and the cosmological model via the so-called spectral sirens. Such a method relies on the features in the mass functions, which may originate from some individual subpopulations and hence become blurred/indistinct due to the superposition of different subpopulations. In this work, we propose a novel approach to constrain the cosmic expansion rate with subpopulations of GW events, named multispectral sirens. The advantage of the multispectral sirens compared to the traditional spectral sirens is demonstrated by the simulation with the mock data. The application of this approach to the GWTC-3 data yields (median and symmetric 68.3% credible interval), which is about 19% tighter than the result inferred with the traditional spectral sirens utilizing a powerlaw+peak mass function. The incorporation of the bright standard siren GW170817 with a uniform prior in [10, 200] (log-uniform prior in [20,140]) Mpc−1 km s−1 gives (68.3% confidence level), corresponding to an improvement of ∼26% (23%) with respect to the measurement from sole GW170817.

β Pic运动星团成员η Tel A以及其棕矮星二进制伴星η Tel B的JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument（MIRI）Medium Resolution Spectrograph（MRS）观测结果显示，在PSF减法后，我们恢复了围绕η Tel A的碎片盘的空间分辨率流量，以及伴星的位置。我们呈现了碎片盘的新的5-26 μm光谱数据，其中我们发现了一个20 μm的硅酸盐特征，以及η Tel B的首个11-21 μm光谱，表明其为裸露的光球。我们得出了伴星的新的相对天体测量数据，将测量的基线延伸至25年，并发现它目前位于一个偏心的长周期轨道的远日点附近。伴星的轨道与碎片盘非常接近，它应该显著地扰动其中的行星体，结果会在中红外光谱中产生可检测的近日点发光，并且与伴星接近共面。然而，与预期相反，我们发现在MIRI MRS数据中，碎片盘似乎是轴对称的，并且可能与伴星不对齐。我们推测这可能是由于存在一个尚未发现的∼0.7-30 MJ行星，其轨道位于盘的内部，半长轴约为∼3-19 au。 <br /><br />总结: 
- 通过MIRI MRS观测发现了碎片盘的空间分辨率流量和伴星的光谱特征
- 得出了伴星的新的相对天体测量数据，展现其长周期轨道
- 预测伴星会扰动盘中的行星体，但实际观测表明盘是轴对称的，可能不与伴星对齐

We report JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) observations of the β Pic moving-group member, η Tel A, along with its brown dwarf binary companion, η Tel B. Following point-spread-function subtraction, we recover the spatially resolved flux from the debris disk around η Tel A, along with the position of the companion exterior to the disk. We present a new 5–26 μm epoch of spectroscopy for the disk, in which we discover a 20 μm silicate feature, and the first ever 11–21 μm spectrum of η Tel B, which indicates a bare photosphere. We derive a new epoch of relative astrometry for the companion, extending the baseline of measurements to 25 yr, and find that it is currently located near the apocenter of an eccentric long-period orbit. The companion’s orbit is close enough to the disk that it should significantly perturb the planetesimals within it, resulting in a detectable mid-IR pericenter glow and near alignment with the companion. Contrary to expectations, however, we find that the disk appears to be axisymmetric and potentially misaligned with the companion in the MIRI MRS data. We posit that this may be due to the presence of an additional, as-yet-undetected ∼0.7–30 MJ planet orbiting interior to the disk, with a semimajor axis of ∼3–19 au.

总结:
Godzilla是位于镜像的Sunburst星系的年轻超星团，动力驱动一个星际气体星云。通过使用哈勃空间望远镜的光度测量和非常大望远镜（VLT）MUSE和VLT/X-Shooter的光谱分析，研究人员得出了该星团和星云的物理和化学特性。他们发现Godzilla非常年轻，质量巨大，具有恒星金属丰度和紧凑的远紫外成分。星际气体富含氮和氦，表明存在恒星风物质，而氧的含量相对于恒星金属丰度高，表明有核心坍缩超新星喷发的痕迹。这导致了星团内的高密度和高压力环境。综合各种分析，他们推断星团和星云中的气体成分与恒星形成和超新星喷发的元素产生模型相吻合。 <div>
We suggest that “Godzilla” of the lensed Sunburst galaxy (z = 2.37) is a young super star cluster powering a nebula of gravitationally trapped stellar ejecta. Employing Hubble Space Telescope photometry and spectroscopy from the Very Large Telescope (VLT) MUSE and VLT/X-Shooter, we infer the physical and chemical properties of the cluster and nebula, finding that Godzilla is young, 4–6 Myr; massive, 2 × 106M⊙ (1000/μ); of stellar metallicity, Z ≃ 0.25 Z⊙; and has a compact far-UV component of ≲1 pc (1000/μ), where μ is the flux magnification factor. The gas is significantly enriched with N and He, indicating stellar wind material, and has highly elevated O relative to the stellar metallicity, indicating entrainment of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) ejecta. The high density, ne ≃ 107−8 cm−3, implies a highly pressurized intracluster environment. We propose that the pressure results from CCSN-driven supersonic turbulence in warm, self-shielding gas, which has accumulated in the cluster center after runaway radiative cooling and is dense enough to resist removal by CCSNe. The nebula gas shows subsolar C/O, Ne/O, and Si/O, which may reflect the CCSN element yields for initial stellar masses >40 M⊙. A comparison to element yield synthesis models for young star clusters shows that the gas abundances are consistent with complete retention and mixture of stellar winds and CCSN ejecta until the inferred cluster age. The inferred O and He enhancement may have implications for the formation of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters, as stars formed from this gas would contradict the observed abundances of second-population stars.

Over 700 bright millisecond-duration radio transients, known as fast radio bursts (FRBs), have been identified to date. Nevertheless, the origin of FRBs remains unknown. Two repeating FRBs (FRB 20121102A and FRB 20190520B) have been verified to be associated with persistent radio sources (PRSs), making them the best candidates to study the nature of FRBs. Monitoring the variability in PRSs is essential for understanding their physical nature. We conducted 22 observations of the PRSs linked to FRB 20121102A and FRB 20190520B using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, to study their variability. We have observed significant flux variability for the PRSs of FRB 20121102A and FRB 20190520B, with a confidence level exceeding 99.99%, based on the observations covering the longest timescale recorded to date. The observed variability of the two PRSs exhibits no significant difference in amplitude across both short and long timescales. We found that the radio-derived star formation rates of the two FRB hosts are significantly higher than those measured by the optical Hα emissions, indicating that their host galaxies are highly obscured or most radio emissions are not from star formation processes. The observed timescale of PRS flux evolution constrained the magnetic field of FRB 20121102A with B∥ ≳ 1 mG and FRB 20190520B with B∥ ≳ 0.1 mG.

总结:
Hubble Space Telescope观测了SN 1987A附近的热点，在1994年至2022年期间，共进行了33次观测。通过对这些热点的研究发现，太空望远镜得出了关于SN 1987A周围环绕介质和喷射物相互作用的结论。他们使用椭圆模型拟合了赤道环，确定了它的倾斜角和主轴方向。他们还发现了26个独特的热点，随着时间的推移，在西侧出现了额外的热点。热点的光变曲线在7000到9000天之间达到最大值，这表明它们与减速有关。研究人员提出了热射线中包含了密集的亚结构，这些密集的亚结构嵌入在密度较低的气体中。初速度是相速度，在冲击波离开赤道环时产生断裂，而晚期速度反映了密集亚结构中辐射冲击波的传播。他们估计密集亚结构的体积充填因子和总质量。 <div>
The nearby SN 1987A offers a unique opportunity to investigate the complex shock interaction between the ejecta and circumstellar medium. We track the evolution of the optical hot spots within the equatorial ring (ER) by analyzing 33 Hubble Space Telescope imaging observations between 1994 and 2022. By fitting the ER with an elliptical model, we determine its inclination to be 42.°85 ± 0.°50 with its major axis oriented −6.°24 ± 0.°31 from the west. We identify 26 distinct hot spots across the ER, with additional ones emerging over time, particularly on the western side. The hot spots initially show high velocities ranging from 390 to 1660 km s−1, followed by a deceleration phase around day ∼ 8000. Subsequent velocities vary from 40 to 660 km s−1. The light curves of the hot spots reach maxima between 7000 and 9000 days, suggesting a connection with the deceleration. Many spots are spatially resolved and show elongation perpendicular to the direction of motion, indicative of a short cooling time. To explain these results, we propose that each hot spot comprises dense substructures embedded in less dense gas. The initial velocities are then phase velocities, where the break occurs when the blast wave leaves the ER, while the late velocities reflect the propagation of radiative shocks in the dense substructures. We estimate that the dense substructures have a volumetric filling factor of and a total mass of .

We present the first results of the holographic beam-mapping program for the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME). We describe the implementation of a holographic technique as adapted for CHIME, and introduce the processing pipeline which prepares the raw holographic timestreams for analysis of beam features. We use data from six bright sources across the full 400–800 MHz observing band of CHIME to provide measurements of the copolar and cross-polar beam response in both amplitude and phase for all 1024 dual-polarized feeds in the array. In addition, we present comparisons with independent probes of the CHIME beam, which indicate the presence of polarized beam leakage. Holographic measurements of the beam have already been applied in science with CHIME, e.g., in estimating the detection significance of far-sidelobe fast radio bursts, and in validating the beam models used for CHIME’s first detections of 21 cm emission (in cross-correlation with measurements of large-scale structure from galaxy surveys and the Lyα forest). Measurements presented in this paper, and future holographic results, will provide a unique data set to characterize the CHIME beam and improve the experiment’s prospects for a detection of the baryon acoustic oscillation signal.

<div> 模型、恒星形成、反馈、宇宙学模拟、黑洞反馈
总结:<br /><br />这篇论文讨论了星系性质与暗物质晕体质量的关系，以及反馈环路如何调节恒星形成的问题。在之前的一篇论文中提出了一个称为“最简风险调控模型”的简单超新星反馈模型，并解释了其含义和讨论了其影响。该模型是一个跟踪暗物质晕体周围的重子气体-中心星系大气的质量和能量的会计系统。代数方程的解揭示了低质量暗物质晕体中的恒星形成主要通过扩展晕体而自我调节，最终导致恒星质量对星系风负荷特性不敏感。最重要的是超新星能量与周围气体耦合的比例。然而，僅靠超新星反馈无法扩展高质量暗物质晕体的大气。根据最简风险调控模型，将发生大气收缩危机，这可能是引发强黑洞反馈的原因。该模型还预测，宇宙学模拟中出现的周围介质特性主要取决于其产生的流出的具体能量，我们根据该预测解释了几个数值模拟的定性特性。 <div>
The scaling of galaxy properties with halo mass suggests that feedback loops regulate star formation, but there is no consensus yet about how those feedback loops work. To help clarify discussions of galaxy-scale feedback, Paper I presented a very simple model for supernova feedback that it called the minimalist regulator model. This follow-up paper interprets that model and discusses its implications. The model itself is an accounting system that tracks all of the mass and energy associated with a halo’s circumgalactic baryons—the central galaxy’s atmosphere. Algebraic solutions for the equilibrium states of that model reveal that star formation in low-mass halos self-regulates primarily by expanding the atmospheres of those halos, ultimately resulting in stellar masses that are insensitive to the mass-loading properties of galactic winds. What matters most is the proportion of supernova energy that couples with circumgalactic gas. However, supernova feedback alone fails to expand galactic atmospheres in higher-mass halos. According to the minimalist regulator model, an atmospheric contraction crisis ensues, which may be what triggers strong black hole feedback. The model also predicts that circumgalactic medium properties emerging from cosmological simulations should depend largely on the specific energy of the outflows they produce, and we interpret the qualitative properties of several numerical simulations in light of that prediction.

这篇论文提出了一个新的框架，用于理解星系与其环绕星际介质（CGM）之间的关系。它专注于加热和冷却之间的不平衡如何导致CGM的扩展或收缩。通过跟踪与暗物质晕的重子相关的所有质量和能量，包括它们的引力势能，即使反馈推动了其中一些质子超出了晕的维里半径。我们展示了如何在这个框架内代数地推导出一个星系的平衡状态，并分析了平衡星形成速率如何取决于超新星反馈。我们考虑了改变质量卸载参数的后果，该参数与星系的气体排出速率（）和其星形成速率（）的关系，并得到了挑战常见假设的结果。特别地，我们发现低质量星系的平衡星形成速率通常不敏感于质量卸载，而当质量卸载确实重要时，增加它实际上会导致更多的星形成，因为需要更多的超新星能量来抵抗大气的收缩。<br /><br />总结: 这篇论文提出了一个新的框架，用于理解星系与其环绕星际介质（CGM）之间的关系，重点关注了加热和冷却之间的不平衡如何影响CGM的扩展或收缩。另外，还分析了平衡星形成速率如何取决于超新星反馈以及质量卸载参数的影响。研究发现，低质量星系的平衡星形成速率通常不受质量卸载的影响，且增加质量卸载实际上会导致更多的星形成，因为需要更多的超新星能量来抵抗大气的收缩。 <div>
This paper presents a new framework for understanding the relationship between a galaxy and its circumgalactic medium (CGM). It focuses on how imbalances between heating and cooling cause either expansion or contraction of the CGM. It does this by tracking all of the mass and energy associated with a halo’s baryons, including their gravitational potential energy, even if feedback has pushed some of those baryons beyond the halo’s virial radius. We show how a star-forming galaxy’s equilibrium state can be algebraically derived within the context of this framework, and we analyze how the equilibrium star formation rate depends on supernova feedback. We consider the consequences of varying the mass loading parameter relating a galaxy’s gas mass outflow rate ( ) to its star formation rate ( ) and obtain results that challenge common assumptions. In particular, we find that equilibrium star formation rates in low-mass galaxies are generally insensitive to mass loading, and when mass loading does matter, increasing it actually results in more star formation because more supernova energy is needed to resist atmospheric contraction.

<title>Proposed Importance of HOCO Chemistry: Inefficient Formation of CO2 from CO and OH Reactions on Ice Dust</title>

<div> 关键词: JWST ice observations, CO2 formation, HOCO radical, carboxylic acids, experimental demonstration<br />
总结: <br />
本研究关注JWST冰观测带来的CO2形成反应，重点研究了星际冰中最重要的分子CO2的形成反应。实验证明，CO + OH → CO2 + H的主要产物并非CO2，而是高反应性的自由基HOCO。HOCO自由基后续可能通过氢抽提反应逐步转化为CO2，但也与其他反应竞争，导致生成羧酸（R-COOH）。这些结果凸显了HOCO化学的重要性，鼓励进一步探索这种自由基的化学性质。 <div>
With the advent of JWST ice observations, dedicated studies on the formation reactions of detected molecules are becoming increasingly important. One of the most interesting molecules in interstellar ice is CO2. Despite its simplicity, the main formation reaction considered, CO + OH → CO2 + H through the energetic HOCO* intermediate on ice dust, is subject to uncertainty because it directly competes with the stabilization of HOCO as a final product, which is formed through energy dissipation of HOCO* to the water ice. When energy dissipation to the surface is effective during the reaction, HOCO can be a dominant product. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate that the major product of the reaction is indeed not CO2, but rather the highly reactive radical HOCO. The HOCO radical can later evolve into CO2 through H-abstraction reactions, but these reactions compete with additional reactions, leading to the formation of carboxylic acids (R-COOH). Our results highlight the importance of HOCO chemistry and encourage further exploration of the chemistry of this radical.

<div> Gaia Data Release 3, kinematic data, stellar halo, substructures, metallicity estimates
<br /><br />
总结:本研究利用Gaia DR3目录中的动力学数据以及由Gaia BP/RP光谱稳健推导的金属丰度，探索了银河恒星晕中已知和潜在的新次结构。通过在运动积分空间（即E，Lz和L⊥）中应用基于密度的噪声聚类算法，识别了五个先前已知的次结构：Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus（GSE），Helmi streams，I'itoi和Sequoia以及hot thick disk。此外，我们在这项工作中还发现了NGC 3201和NGC 5139，NGC 3201在相空间和金属丰度上与Arjuna有类似的分布，这可能意味着它们有相同的起源。这项研究发现了三个新的次结构：Prograde Substructure 1（PG1），Prograde Substructure 2（PG2）和Low Energy Group。PG1的Vϕ比典型的GSE成员星体高，被认为是GSE的低偏心率和富金属部分，或者是金属贫穷盘的一部分。PG2与Aleph共享运动学相似性，被认为是其相对较高偏心率的成分或Aleph和盘的混合体。Low Energy Group的金属贫穷成分的金属丰度分布函数均值为[M/H]∼−1.29（与Heracles [M/H]∼−1.26相比），可能与Heracles有关。 <div>
Using kinematic data from the Gaia Data Release 3 catalog, along with metallicity estimates robustly derived from Gaia BP/RP spectra, we have explored the Galactic stellar halo in search of both known and potentially new substructures. By applying the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise clustering algorithm in integrals-of-motion space (i.e., E, Lz, and L⊥ ), we identified five previously known substructures: Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), Helmi streams, I'itoi and Sequoia, and the hot thick disk. We additionally found NGC 3201 and NGC 5139 in this work, and NGC 3201 shares similar distributions in phase space and metallicities to Arjuna, which possibly implies that they have the same origin. Three newly discovered substructures are Prograde Substructure 1 (PG1), Prograde Substructure 2 (PG2), and the Low Energy Group. PG1, with a higher Vϕ than typical GSE member stars, is considered as either a low-eccentricity and metal-rich part of GSE or part of the metal-poor disk. PG2, sharing kinematic similarities with Aleph, is thought to be its relatively highly eccentric component or the mixture of Aleph and the disk. The Low Energy Group, whose metal-poor component of metallicity distribution function has a mean value [M/H] ∼ −1.29 (compared to that of Heracles [M/H] ∼ −1.26), may have associations with Heracles.

这篇文章描述了对JADES-GS-z11-0和JADES-GS-z13-0两个迄今为止JWST观测中最遥远的星系进行的Ultradeep James Webb Space Telescope（JWST）NIRSpec PRISM和光栅光谱的研究。通过这些超深入的观测（分别为75小时和56小时），为我们提供了一个独特的机会来探索这两个星系的红移、恒星特性、紫外线亮度和斜率。对于JADES-GS-z11-0，我们发现了多个发射线，包括[O ii]λλ3726、3729和[Ne iii]λ3869，我们有94%的把握确定了一个光谱红移。对于JADES-GS-z13-0，我们提出了排查线流量和线等价宽度的严格上限。在这个光谱红移下，JADES-GS-z11-0的Lyα断裂可以与一个受阻的Lyα吸收体完美契合。这些结果表明，中性氢分数和Lyman阻尼翼如何影响了类似源的光谱红移的恢复，从而提供了洞察在JWST观测到的远距离星系的光度红移过度预测的原因。此外，我们分析了更新的NIRCam光度测定，计算了这些可解明的源的形态特性，并在JADES-GS-z11-0的南面0.″3处发现了一个类似光度红移的次级源，暗示了早期宇宙中星系是如何通过相互作用而生长的。

We describe new ultradeep James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec PRISM and grating spectra for the galaxies JADES-GS-z11-0 ( ) and JADES-GS-z13-0 ( ), the most distant spectroscopically confirmed galaxy discovered in the first year of JWST observations. The extraordinary depth of these observations (75 hr and 56 hr, respectively) provides a unique opportunity to explore the redshifts, stellar properties, UV magnitudes, and slopes for these two sources. For JADES-GS-z11-0, we find evidence for multiple emission lines, including [O ii]λλ3726, 3729 and [Ne iii]λ3869, resulting in a spectroscopic redshift we determine with 94% confidence. We present stringent upper limits on the emission-line fluxes and line equivalent widths for JADES-GS-z13-0. At this spectroscopic redshift, the Lyα break in JADES-GS-z11-0 can be fit with a damped Lyα absorber with . These results demonstrate how neutral hydrogen fraction and Lyman-damping wings may impact the recovery of spectroscopic redshifts for sources like these, providing insight into the overprediction of the photometric redshifts seen for distant galaxies observed with JWST. In addition, we analyze updated NIRCam photometry to calculate the morphological properties of these resolved sources, and find a secondary source 0.″3 south of JADES-GS-z11-0 at a similar photometric redshift, hinting at how galaxies grow through interactions in the early Universe.

<title>WALLABY Pilot Survey: Gas-rich Galaxy Scaling Relations from Marginally Resolved Kinematic Models</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad84ba</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the first set of galaxy scaling relations derived from kinematic models of the Widefield Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY) pilot phase observations. Combining the results of the first and second pilot data releases, there are 236 available kinematic models. We develop a framework for robustly measuring H i disk structural properties from these kinematic models, applicable to the full WALLABY survey. Utilizing this framework, we obtained the H i size, a measure of the rotational velocity, and angular momentum for 148 galaxies. These comprise the largest sample of galaxy properties from an untargeted, uniformly observed, and modeled H i survey to date. We study the neutral atomic hydrogen (H i) size–mass, size–velocity, mass–velocity, and angular momentum–mass scaling relations. We calculate the slope, intercept, and scatter for these scaling relations and find that they are similar to those obtained from other H i surveys. We also obtain stellar masses for 92 of the 148 robustly measured galaxies using multiband photometry through Dark Energy Sky Instrument Legacy Imaging Survey Data Release 10 images. We use a subset of 61 of these galaxies that have consistent optical and kinematic inclinations to examine the stellar and baryonic Tully–Fisher relations as well as the gas fraction–disk stability and gas fraction–baryonic mass relations. These measurements and relations demonstrate the unprecedented resource that WALLABY will represent for resolved galaxy scaling relations in H i.

<title>Evolutionary States and Triplicity of Four Massive Semidetached Binaries with Long-term Decreasing Orbital Periods in the LMC</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The massive semidetached binary with a long-term decreasing orbital period may involve a rapid mass-transfer phase in Case A, and thus, they are good astrophysical laboratories for investigating the evolution of massive binary stars. In this work, by using the long-term observational light curves from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment project and other data in the low-metallicity Large Magellanic Cloud, four semidetached massive binaries with long-term decreases in the orbital periods are detected from 165 EB-type close binaries. It is found that the more massive component in S07798 is filling its Roche lobe, where the period decrease is caused by mass transfer from the primary to the secondary. However, the other three (S03065, S12631, S16873) are semidetached binaries with a lobe-filling secondary where the mass transfer between the components should cause the period to increase if the angular momentum is conservative. The long-term period decreases in these three systems may be caused by angular momentum loss. Additionally, the orbital periods of three systems (S03065, S07798, S16873) are detected to show cyclic variation with periods shorter than 11 yr, which can be plausibly explained by the presence of close-in third bodies in these massive binaries. Based on all of these results, it is suggested that the detected four semidetached binaries almost have multiplicity. The companion stars are crucial for the origin and evolution of these massive close binaries.

<title>Streaming Instabilities in Accreting Protoplanetary Disks: A Parameter Study</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad862d</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The streaming instability (SI) is currently the leading candidate for triggering planetesimal formation in protoplanetary disks. Recently, a novel variation, the “azimuthal-drift” streaming instability (AdSI), was discovered in disks exhibiting laminar gas accretion. Unlike the classical SI, the AdSI does not require pressure gradients and can concentrate dust even at low abundances. We extend previous simulations of the AdSI to explore the impact of dust abundance, accretion-flow strength, pressure gradients, and grain size. For a dimensionless accretion-flow strength αM = 0.1 and particle Stokes number St = 0.1, we find the AdSI produces dust filaments for initial dust-to-gas ratios as low as ϵ = 0.01. For ϵ ≳ 1, maximum dust-to-gas ratios of order 100 are attained, which can be expected to undergo gravitational collapse. Furthermore, even in systems dominated by the classical SI, an accretion flow drives filament formation, without which the disk remains in a state of small-scale turbulence. Our results suggest that an underlying accretion flow facilitates dust concentration and may thus promote planetesimal formation.

As the descendants of stars with masses less than 8 M⊙ on the main sequence, white dwarfs provide a unique way to constrain planetary occurrence around intermediate-mass stars (spectral types BAF) that are otherwise difficult to measure with radial-velocity or transit surveys. We update the analysis of more than 250 ultraviolet spectra of hot (13,000 K < Teff < 30,000 K), young (less than 800 Myr) white dwarfs collected by the Hubble Space Telescope, which reveals that more than 40% of all white dwarfs show photospheric silicon and sometimes carbon, signposts for the presence of remnant planetary systems. However, the fraction of white dwarfs with metals significantly decreases for massive white dwarfs (MWD > 0.8 M⊙), descendants of stars with masses greater than 3.5 M⊙ on the main sequence, as just % exhibit metal pollution. In contrast, 44% ± 6% of a subset of white dwarfs (MWD < 0.7 M⊙) unbiased by the effects of radiative levitation are actively accreting planetary debris. While the population of massive white dwarfs is expected to be influenced by the outcome of binary evolution, we do not find merger remnants to broadly affect our sample. We connect our measured occurrence rates of metal pollution on massive white dwarfs to empirical constraints of planetary formation and survival around stars with masses greater than 3.5 M⊙ on the main sequence.

<title>Could the Interband Lag of Active Galactic Nucleus Vary Randomly?</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad86bc</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The interband lags among the optical broad-band continua of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have been intensively explored over the past decade. However, the nature of the lags remains under debate. Here, utilizing two distinct scenarios for AGN variability, i.e., the thermal fluctuation of accretion disk and the reprocessing of both the accretion disk and clouds in the broad line region, we show that, owing to the random nature of AGN variability, the interband lags of an individual AGN would vary from one campaign with a finite baseline to another. Specifically, the thermal fluctuation scenario implies larger variations in the lags than the reprocessing scenario. Moreover, the former predicts a positive correlation between the lag and variation amplitude, while the latter does not result in such a correlation. For both scenarios, averaging the lags of an individual AGN measured with repeated and nonoverlapping campaigns would give rise to a stable lag, which is larger for a longer baseline and gets to saturation for a sufficiently long baseline. However, obtaining the stable lag for an individual AGN is very time-consuming. Alternatively, it can be equivalently inferred by averaging the lags of a sample of AGNs with similar physical properties, and thus can be properly compared with predictions of AGN models. In addition, several new observational tests suggested by our simulations are discussed, as well as the role of the deep high-cadence surveys of the Wide Field Survey Telescope in enriching our knowledge of the lags.

<title>Test of Cosmic Web-feeding Model for Star Formation in Galaxy Clusters in the COSMOS Field</title>

It is yet to be understood how large-scale environments influence star formation activity in galaxy clusters. One recently proposed mechanism is that galaxy clusters can remain star forming when fed by infalling groups and star-forming galaxies from large-scale structures (LSSs) surrounding them (the “web-feeding” model). Using the COSMOS2020 catalog that has half a million galaxies with high-accuracy (σΔz/1+z ∼ 0.01) photometric redshifts, we study the relationship between star formation activities in galaxy clusters and their surrounding environment to test the web-feeding model. We first identify 68 cluster candidates at 0.3 ≤ z ≤ 1.4 with halo masses at 1013.0–1014.5M⊙ and the surrounding LSSs with the friends-of-friends algorithm. We find that clusters with low fractions of quiescent galaxies tend to be connected with extended LSSs as expected in the web-feeding model. We also investigated the time evolution of the web-feeding trend using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation. Even though no clear correlation between the quiescent galaxy fraction of galaxy clusters and the significance of LSSs around them is found in the simulation, we verify that the quiescent galaxy fractions of infallers such as groups (M200 ≥ 1012M⊙) and galaxies (M200 < 1012M⊙) are smaller than the quiescent fraction of cluster members and that infallers can lower the quiescent fraction of clusters. These results imply that cluster-to-cluster variations of quiescent galaxy fraction at z ≤ 1 can at least partially be explained by feeding materials through cosmic webs to clusters.

<title>Sigmoid Eruption Associated with the X9.3 Flare from AR 12673 Drives the Gradual Solar Energetic Particle Event on 2017 September 6</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Large gradual solar energetic particle (SEP) events can pose a radiation risk to crewed spaceflight and a significant threat to near-Earth satellites; however, the origin of the SEP seed particle population, and how these particles are released, accelerated and transported into the heliosphere are not well understood. We analyze NOAA active region (AR) 12673, which was the source responsible for multiple large gradual SEP events during 2017 September, and found that almost immediately after each significant eruptive event associated with SEPs an enhanced Si/S abundance ratio was measured by Wind, consistent with the previous work by Brooks et al. The EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) onboard Hinode took data roughly 8 hr before the second SEP event on 2017 September 6, which allowed the regions of enhanced Si/S abundance ratio in the AR to be determined. We have shown that the AR contains plasma with elemental abundance values detected in situ by Wind. In particular, the plasma originates from the core of the AR, similar to Brooks et al., but in the moss (footpoints) associated with hot sigmoidal AR loops. The sigmoid, which contains highly fractionated plasma, erupts and propagates toward an Earth-connected magnetic null point, providing a direct channel for the highly fractionated plasma to escape and be detected in the near-Earth environment.

<div> 星系、吸收线、宇宙中性氢、金属离子、星系演化
<br /><br />总结:
本文介绍了一项关于矮星系周围环星系和星系间介质的新的吸收线测量研究。研究使用了CUBS（Cosmic Ultraviolet Baryon Survey）提供的91个矮星系的视线，通过太阳系外大约300千秒差距范围内的探测来研究这些星系的吸收线特征。研究结果表明，低和中等电离态的金属吸收在矮星系周围是罕见的，而高度电离态的氧六离子在通过矮星系视线时却很常见。通过这些测量，研究估计环星系和星系间介质中的氧六离子占据了矮星系金属元素的大部分比例。吸收动力学表明相对较小的部分氧六离子气体是形式上解离的。这些结果表明，在红移为z≲ 1的低质量系统能够有效地在附近的环星系和星系间介质中保留大部分金属。 <div>
The shallow potential wells of star-forming dwarf galaxies make their surrounding circumgalactic and intergalactic medium (CGM/IGM) sensitive laboratories for studying the inflows and outflows thought to regulate galaxy evolution. We present new absorption-line measurements in quasar sight lines, probing within projected distances of <300 kpc from 91 star-forming field dwarf galaxies with a median stellar mass of at 0.077 < z < 0.73, from the Cosmic Ultraviolet Baryon Survey (CUBS). In this redshift range, the CUBS quasar spectra cover a suite of transitions including H i, low, and intermediate metal ions (e.g., C ii, Si ii, C iii, and Si iii), and highly ionized O vi. This CUBS-Dwarfs survey enables constraints with samples nine times larger than past dwarf CGM/IGM studies with similar ionic coverage. We find that low and intermediate ionization metal absorption is rare around dwarf galaxies, consistent with previous surveys of local dwarfs. In contrast, highly ionized O vi is commonly observed in sight lines that pass within the virial radius of a dwarf, and O vi detection rates are nonnegligible at projected distances of 1−2× the virial radius. Based on these measurements, we estimate that the O vi-bearing phase of the CGM/IGM accounts for a dominant share of the metal budget of dwarf galaxies. The absorption kinematics suggest that a relatively modest fraction of the O vi-bearing gas is formally unbound. Together, these results imply that low-mass systems at z ≲ 1 effectively retain a substantial fraction of their metals within the nearby CGM and IGM.

<div> 关键词: 爆发、超新星、辐射流体力学模拟、环境、混合
总结: 
本研究利用CASTRO代码和OPAL不透明度表进行了SN 1987A超新星爆发的二维多波段辐射流体动力学模拟，考虑了八个光子能组。研究了SN 1987A的前超新环境对结果的影响，包括稳定的恒星风、喷发性质量损失和伴星存在。爆发光度曲线持续一个小时，峰值光度约为4 × 1046 erg s−1，在X射线中的衰减率约为3.5 mag hr−1。主导波段在初始爆发后约3小时转换到紫外线，其光度衰减率约为1.5 mag hr−1，与观测到的爆发尾部相符。爆发辐射的详细特征对爆炸前环境敏感。此外，二维模拟展示了多维混合的重要性及其对激波动力学和辐射发射的影响。爆发所产生的混合可能导致超新星喷射物的全局不对称性，并影响其后的超新星遗迹形成。 <div>
Shock breakout is the first electromagnetic signal from supernovae (SNe), which contains important information on the explosion energy and the size and chemical composition of the progenitor star. This paper presents the first two-dimensional (2D) multiwavelength radiation hydrodynamics simulations of SN 1987A shock breakout by using the CASTRO code with the OPAL opacity table considering eight photon groups from infrared to X-ray. To investigate the impact of the pre-SN environment of SN 1987A, we consider three possible circumstellar medium environments: a steady wind, an eruptive mass loss, and the existence of a companion star. In sum, the resulting breakout light curve has an hour-long duration and a peak luminosity of ∼4 × 1046 erg s−1, with a decay rate of ∼3.5 mag hr−1 in X-ray. The dominant band transits to UV around 3 hr after the initial breakout, and its luminosity has a decay rate of ∼1.5 mag hr−1 that agrees well with the observed shock breakout tail. The detailed features of breakout emission are sensitive to the pre-explosion environment. Furthermore, our 2D simulations demonstrate the importance of multidimensional mixing and its impacts on shock dynamics and radiation emission. The mixing emerging from the shock breakout may lead to a global asymmetry of SN ejecta and affect its later SN remnant formation.

<title>Evidence for Type Ib/c Origin of the Supernova Remnant G292.0+1.8</title>

<div> 关键词: Circumstellar material, massive stars, grating spectroscopy, Type Ib/c remnant, Wolf-Rayet star <br />
<br />总结: 本研究利用XMM-Newton的Reflection Grating Spectrometer对银河系中的超新星遗迹G292.0+1.8进行了光栅分光测量。观测结果显示，G292.0+1.8中首次检测到了氮七的Lyα线，而氮和氧元素的丰度比显著低于太阳值，这表明G292.0+1.8的前体星经历了强烈的质量流失，并最终演化为一个展露出预超新星的He燃烧层的Wolf-Rayet星。通过与单星和双星演化模型的比较，研究人员得出结论，G292.0+1.8的前体星经历了足够强烈的质量流失，从而发生了Ib/c型超新星的爆发。这一发现为G292.0+1.8的Ib/c型超新星的起源提供了另一个重要证据。 <br /> <br /> <div>
Circumstellar material (CSM) produced by mass loss from massive stars (≳10 M⊙) through strong stellar winds or binary stripping provides rich information for understanding progenitors of core-collapse supernova remnants. In this paper we present a grating spectroscopy of a Galactic SNR G292.0+1.8, which is claimed to be a Type Ib/c remnant in a binary system according to recent studies. If G292.0+1.8 had experienced a strong mass-loss via binary interactions before its explosion, an oxygen-rich material produced in the He-burning layer is expected to be observed in the central belt-like structure formed by shock-heated CSM. Using the Reflection Grating Spectrometer onboard XMM-Newton, we detect N vii Lyα line (0.50 keV) for the first time in G292.0+1.8 and find that the abundance ratio of nitrogen to oxygen is significantly lower (N/O = 0.5 ± 0.1) than the solar value. This low N/O suggests that the progenitor of G292.0+1.8 experienced strong mass-loss and ended up as a Wolf–Rayet star exposing the He-burning layer at the presupernova. Comparing our result and the evolution models of single stars and binaries, we conclude that the progenitor of G292.0+1.8 experienced strong enough mass-loss to occur a Type Ib/c supernova. Our finding is another crucial piece of evidence for a stripped-envelope supernova such as Type Ib/c as the origin of G292.0+1.8.

<div> 关键词: Seyfert 1, NuSTAR, X射线辐射, Eddington比率, 黑洞质量
总结:
本研究对112个近邻明亮的Seyfert 1型活动星系核进行了统一系统的分析，利用核能谱望远镜阵列在2013年8月至2022年5月期间进行的观测。主要目标是研究Seyfert 1星系中X射线冠的性质。通过对NuSTAR光谱拟合物理模型，我们约束了样本中73个源的高能截止能（Ecut）。采用逆康普顿模型拟合光谱来估算样本中112个源的冠温度（kTe），我们约束了42个源的kTe。我们发现Ecut与kTe之间存在强烈的正相关，大多数源位于Ecut=2-3 kTe的经验近似之上。我们调查了从观测光谱中物理模型拟合得到的冠参数之间以及冠参数与天体源的物理属性如爱丁顿比率和黑洞质量之间可能的相关性。我们发现（a）Ecut与光子指数之间存在强烈的相关性，（b）kTe与光学深度之间存在显著的负相关。通过对冠参数与爱丁顿比率和黑洞质量的相关性进行详细的统计分析，我们未发现显著的相关性。本研究观察到的相关性表明，需要一个光学薄的冠来维持一个更热的冠和更陡的光谱。 <div>
We carried out a uniform and systematic analysis of a sample of 112 nearby bright Seyfert 1 type active galactic nuclei, the observations of which were carried out by the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array between 2013 August and 2022 May. The main goal of this analysis is to investigate the nature of the X-ray corona in Seyfert 1 galaxies. By fitting a physical model to the NuSTAR spectra, we could constrain the high-energy cutoff (Ecut) for 73 sources in our sample. To estimate the temperature of the corona (kTe) in our sample of 112 sources, we used the Comptonization model to fit their spectra. We could constrain kTe in 42 sources. We found a strong positive correlation between Ecut and kTe, with most of the sources lying above the empirical approximation of Ecut = 2−3 kTe. We investigated for possible correlations between various properties of the corona obtained from physical model fits to the observed spectra and between various coronal parameters and physical properties of the sources such as Eddington ratio and black hole mass. We found (a) a strong correlation between Ecut and the photon index and (b) a significant negative correlation between kTe and the optical depth. From detailed statistical analysis of the correlation of coronal parameters with the Eddington ratio and black hole mass, we found no significant correlation. The correlations observed in this study indicate that an optically thin corona is needed to sustain a hotter corona with a steeper spectrum.

<div> relativistic magnetized jets, black holes, synchrotron-emission, magnetohydrodynamic simulations, active galactic nuclei<br />
<br />总结:<br />本研究通过三维相对论磁流体力学模拟，从不同视线和频率得出了合成的同步辐射特征。研究发现，不同注入口形式的注射（稳态、变化和进动）导致了不同的激波结构，形成了多个局部辐射模式，解释为喷流节点。这些节点模式会因合并或多普勒增强而变暗或变亮，导致喷流的可变性。我们发现，高速运动的节点可通过超光速运动，即小于或等于5倍光速，被观测到。所有喷流的同步辐射光谱显示双峰结构，反映了具有不同电子群体的激波特性和它们的年龄。进动喷流是最强的发射源，其光谱比稳定和可变喷流更为平坦。总的来说，我们发现通过喷流内的激波不断重新加速电子是观察到大时间和长度尺度上的扩展喷流辐射的重要先决条件。 <div>
Relativistic magnetized jets, originating near black holes, are observed to exhibit substructured flows. In this study, we present synthetic synchrotron-emission signatures for different lines of sight and frequencies, derived from three-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of pc-scale Active Galactic Nuclei jets. These simulations apply different injection nozzles, injecting steady, variable, and precessing jets. Extending our previous study, here, we have developed a bridge to connect jet dynamics and particle acceleration within relativistic shocks with nonthermal radiation dominant in jets. The emission is derived from Lagrangian particles—injected into the jet and following the fluid—accelerated through diffusive shock acceleration and subsequently cooled by emitting energy via synchrotron and inverse-Compton processes. Overall, the different shock structures lead to the formation of numerous localized emission patterns—interpreted as jet knots. These knot patterns can fade or flare, also as a consequence of merging or Doppler boosting, leading to jet variability. We find knots with high-enough pattern speed supposed to be visible as superluminal motion ≲5c. Synchrotron spectra of all jets reveal double-humped structures, reflecting multiple electron populations characterized by the nature of underlying shock and their age. The precessing jet is the most powerful emitter, featuring a spectrum flatter than the steady and the variable jet. The emission, although essentially governed by the acceleration through shocks, depends on the cooling history of the particle as well. Overall, the continuous reacceleration of electrons through shocks along the jet we found is an essential prerequisite for observing extended jet emission over large timescales and length scales.

该研究介绍了Lyα连续谱分析网络（LyCAN），它是一个基于卷积神经网络的模型，能够预测的未吸收类星体连续谱，其波长范围为1040–1600 Å。通过红侧Lyα发射线（1216–1600 Å）的信息，对非吸收类星体连续谱进行预测。研究利用高分辨率、低红移（z < 0.2）的哈勃太空望远镜/宇宙起源光谱仪（COS）类星体光谱的非负矩阵分解（NMF）系数，生成了基于高斯混合模型表示的合成光谱。LyCAN在测试集上表现极佳，对DESI模拟样本的森林区域实现了1.5%的中位误差，在COS原始光谱样本上为4.1%。与同一训练集的主成分分析（PCA）和NMF模型相比，LyCAN的表现提高了40%以上。研究还对2.1≤z≤4.2范围内的83,635个DESI Year 1光谱进行了内在连续谱预测，并进行了有效光学深度的绝对测量。根据测量结果，拟合得出了功率律形式的光学深度演化参数。研究结果表明，LyCAN能够仅依靠森林区域外的光谱信息准确预测类星体连续谱，在测量光学深度演化方面取得了与高分辨率地面观测的高度一致性。 <br /><br />总结: LyCAN是一个基于卷积神经网络的模型，能够准确预测未吸收类星体连续谱，并在光学深度演化方面取得了重要结果。 <div>
We present the Lyα Continuum Analysis Network (LyCAN), a convolutional neural network that predicts the unabsorbed quasar continuum within the rest-frame wavelength range of 1040–1600 Å based on the red side of the Lyα emission line (1216–1600 Å). We developed synthetic spectra based on a Gaussian mixture model representation of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) coefficients. These coefficients were derived from high-resolution, low-redshift (z < 0.2) Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) quasar spectra. We supplemented this COS-based synthetic sample with an equal number of DESI Year 5 mock spectra. LyCAN performs extremely well on testing sets, achieving a median error in the forest region of 1.5% on the DESI mock sample, 2.0% on the COS-based synthetic sample, and 4.1% on the original COS spectra. LyCAN outperforms principal component analysis (PCA) and NMF-based prediction methods using the same training set by 40% or more. We predict the intrinsic continua of 83,635 DESI Year 1 spectra in the redshift range of 2.1 ≤ z ≤ 4.2 and perform an absolute measurement of the evolution of the effective optical depth. This is the largest sample employed to measure the optical depth evolution to date. We fit a power law of the form to our measurements and find τ0 = (2.46 ± 0.14) × 10−3 and γ = 3.62 ± 0.04. Our results show particular agreement with high-resolution, ground-based observations around z = 2, indicating that LyCAN is able to predict the quasar continuum in the forest region with only spectral information outside the forest.

总结:
GN-z11是一个位于z = 10.60的明亮星系，研究了其空间扩展的C iii] λλ1907, 1909发射线，发现有红移和蓝移的速度梯度，可能是由盘面旋转或星系流出现导致，需要更高信噪比和更高分辨率的数据进一步研究。GalPak3D的前向建模得出了旋转速度和速度分散值，但存在较大不确定性。模拟结果显示，早期宇宙中存在盘面旋转的星系，但需要更多数据来确认速度梯度的物理起源。 <div>
We investigate the dynamics of GN-z11, a luminous galaxy at z = 10.60, carefully analyzing the public deep integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data taken with the JWST NIRSpec integral field unit. While the observations of the IFS data originally targeted an He ii clump near GN-z11, we find that the C iii] λλ1907, 1909 emission from ionized gas at GN-z11 is bright and spatially extended significantly beyond the point-spread function (PSF). The spatially extended C iii] emission of GN-z11 shows a velocity gradient with red- and blueshifted components in the north and south directions, respectively, which cannot be explained by the variation of the [C iii] λ1907/C iii] λ1909 line ratios. Assuming the velocity gradient is produced by disk rotation, we perform forward modeling with GalPak3D, including the effects of PSF smearing and line blending, and obtain a rotation velocity of km s−1, a velocity dispersion of km s−1, and a ratio of . The vrot/σv value would suggest a rotation-dominated disk existing at z > 10, albeit with large uncertainties. The rotation velocity agrees with those of numerical simulations predicting a rotating disk formed in the early Universe under the conditions of mass compaction and weak feedback. While the velocity gradient is consistent with the rotating-disk solution, we recognize that galactic outflows can also explain the velocity gradient, as well as the extended morphology and the high velocity dispersion found in the outskirts. Higher-signal-to-noise-ratio and higher-resolution data are necessary to conclude the physical origin of the velocity gradient in GN-z11.

The timely and precise prediction of the arrival time of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is crucial in mitigating their potential adverse effects. In this study, we present a novel prediction method utilizing a deep-learning framework coupled with physical characteristics of CMEs and background solar wind. Time series images from synchronized solar white-light and EUV observations of 156 geoeffective CME events during 2000–2020 are collected for this study, according to the Richardson and Cane interplanetary CME directory and the SOHO/LASCO CME catalog of NASA/CDAW. The CME parameters are obtained from the CDAW website and the solar wind parameters are from OMNI2 website. The observational images are first fed into a convolutional neural network (CNN) to train a regression model as Model A. The results generated by the original CNN are then integrated with 11 selected physical parameters in additional neural network layers of Model B to improve the predictions. Under optimal configurations, Model A achieves a minimum mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.87 hr, whereas Model B yields a minimum MAE of 5.12 hr. During model training, we employed tenfold cross validation to reduce the occasionality of biased data. The average MAE of Model B on 10 folds is 33% lower than that of model A. The results demonstrate that combining the imaging observations with the physical properties of CMEs and background solar wind to train a machine-learning model can benefit the forecasting of CME arrival times.

Lenticular galaxies (S0s) are formed mainly from the gas stripping of spirals in the cluster. But how S0s form and evolve in the field is still in need of being resolved. Based on spatially resolved observations from the optical Hispanic Astronomical Center in Andalusia 3.5 m telescope with the PPAK Integral Field Spectroscopy instrument and Northern Extended Millimeter Array, we study a dwarf (M* < 109 M⊙) S0, PGC 44685, with triple star-forming regions in the central region, namely, A, B, and C, respectively. In northwest region C, we clearly detect the spectral features of Wolf–Rayet (W-R) stars and quantify the W-R population by stacking spectra with high W-R significance. Most of the molecular gas is concentrated in region C(W-R), and there is diffuse gas around regions A and B. The W-R region possesses the strongest intensities of Hα, CO(1–0), and 3 mm continuum, indicating its ongoing violent star formation (gas depletion timescale ≲25 Myr) with tentative hundreds (<500) km s−1 of stellar winds accompanied by the W-R phase. Most (∼96%) of the three star-forming regions show relatively low-metallicity distributions, suggesting possible (minor) accretions of metal-poor gas that trigger the subsequent complex star formation in a field S0 galaxy. We speculate that PGC 44685 will become quiescent in less than 30 Myr if there is no new molecular gas to provide raw materials for star formation. The existence of this dwarf star-forming S0 presents an example of star formation in the low-mass/metallicity S0 galaxy.

利用经度-速度 (l-v) 包络约束银河系 (MW) 条形势的新方法。先前的研究使用l-v图解释了观测到的高速恒星的分布。作者成功地复现了他们的结果，但发现他们的方法仅限于一种周期轨道。相反，作者建议l-v包络提供了更全面的约束。作者比较了M. Portail等人MW势场模型 (P17)中的测试粒子与Bulge Asymmetries and Dynamical Evolution (BAaDE)调查观测的SiO激光器星的属性。作者发现条形势产生的l-v包络与观测数据显示出合理的一致性，尽管在银心附近存在轻微差异。这些不一致性暗示了P17势场产生了较低的中心旋转曲线，稍微更大的四极强度，或可能低估了图案速度。作者还采用了由G. H. Hunter等人提出的具有修改中心质量组分的P17势场的更新版本 (H24)。对l-v包络的拟合表明，H24势场并未完全解决现有的挑战，可能暗示了对中心条质量的可能低估。我们的研究表明l-v包络可用作约束银河势场的有价值工具，并提供了对MW条形势的洞察。 <br /><br />总结: 摘要包括了对l-v包络的利用以约束MW条形势的新方法，以及用于对比观测数据的测试粒子模型。还讨论了可能的势场参数和银心动力学的一致性问题。最终认为l-v包络是一个有价值的工具，可用于约束银河潜能，提供了对MW条形势的洞察。 <div>
We introduce a novel method that utilizes the longitude–velocity (l − v) envelope to constrain the Milky Way (MW) bar potential. Previous work used the l − v diagram to explain the distribution of the observed high-velocity stars. We successfully reproduce their results but find that their method is limited to only one type of periodic orbits. In contrast, we propose that the l − v envelope provides much more comprehensive constraints. We compare the properties of test particles in the M. Portail et al. MW potential model (P17) with the observed SiO maser stars from the Bulge Asymmetries and Dynamical Evolution (BAaDE) survey. We find that the l − v envelope generated by the bar potential demonstrates reasonable agreement with the observational data, albeit with slight discrepancies near the Galactic center. The inconsistencies suggest that the P17 potential yields a lower central rotation curve, a slightly larger quadrupole strength, or a possibly underestimated pattern speed. We also adopt an updated version of the P17 potential with a modified central mass component proposed by G. H. Hunter et al. (H24). The fitting of the l − v envelope suggests that the H24 potential does not completely address the existing challenges and may hint at a possible underestimation of the central bar mass. Our study demonstrates that the l − v envelope can be used as a valuable tool for constraining the Galactic potential and provides insights into the MW bar potential.

We investigate the observable characteristics of the extended atmospheres of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars across a wide range of radio and (sub-)millimeter wavelengths using state-of-the-art 1D dynamical atmosphere and wind models over one pulsation period. We also study the relationships between the observable features and model properties. We further study practical distance ranges for observable sources assuming the capabilities of current and upcoming observatories. We present time-variable, frequency-dependent profiles of pulsating AGB stars’ atmospheres, illustrating observable features in resolved and unresolved observations, including disk brightness temperature, photosphere radius, and resolved and unresolved spectral indices. Notably, temporal variations in disk brightness temperature closely mirror the temperature variability of the stellar atmosphere. We find that while the photospheric radius decreases due to gas dilution in the layers between consecutive shocks, the increase in the observed stellar radius reflects shock propagation through the atmosphere during the expansion phase, providing a direct measurement method for the shock velocity. Furthermore, our models indicate that enhanced gas temperatures after the passage of a strong shock might be observable in the high-frequency Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) bands as a decrease in the brightness temperature with increasing frequency. We demonstrate that synthetic observations based on state-of-the-art dynamical atmosphere and wind models are necessary for proper interpretations of current (ALMA and Very Large Array (VLA)) and future (Square Kilometre Array and next-generation VLA) observations and that multiwavelength observations of AGB stars are crucial for empirical studies of their extended atmospheres.

<title>Sharp Periodic Flares and Long-term Variability in the High-mass X-Ray Binary XTE J1829−098 from RXTE PCA, Swift BAT, and MAXI Observations</title>

XTE J1829−098 is a transient X-ray pulsar with a period of ∼7.8 s. It is a candidate Be star system, although the evidence for this is not yet definitive. We investigated the twenty-year-long X-ray light curve using the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer Proportional Counter Array (PCA), Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Burst Alert Telescope, and the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image. We find that all three light curves are clearly modulated on the ∼244 days orbital period previously reported from PCA monitoring observations, with outbursts confined to a narrow phase range. The light curves also show that XTE J1829−098 was in an inactive state between approximately 2008 December and 2018 April, and no strong outbursts occurred. Such behavior is typical of Be X-ray binary systems, with the absence of outbursts likely related to the dissipation of the Be star's decretion disk. The mean outburst shapes can be approximated with a triangular profile and, from a joint fit of this to all three light curves, we refine the orbital period to 243.95 ± 0.04 days. The mean outburst profile does not show any asymmetry and has a total phase duration of 0.140 ± 0.007. However, the PCA light curve shows that there is considerable cycle-to-cycle variability of the individual outbursts. We compare the properties of XTE J1829−098 with other sources that show short phase-duration outbursts, in particular GS 1843−02 (2S 1845−024), which has a very similar orbital period, but longer pulse period, and whose orbit is known to be highly eccentric.

<title>Simulating Radio Synchrotron Morphology, Spectra, and Polarization of Cosmic Ray Driven Galactic Winds</title>

The formation of galaxies is significantly influenced by galactic winds, possibly driven by cosmic rays due to their long cooling times and better coupling to plasma compared to radiation. In this study, we compare the radio observations of the edge-on galaxy NGC 4217 from the CHANG-ES collaboration catalog with a mock observation of an isolated galaxy based on the arepo simulation that adopts the state-of-the-art two-moment cosmic ray transport treatment and multiphase interstellar medium model. We find significant agreement between the simulated and observed images and spectroscopic data for reasonable model parameters. Specifically, we find that (i) the shape of the intensity profiles depends weakly on the magnitude of the magnetic field, the distance of the simulated galaxy, and the normalization of the CR electron spectrum. The agreement between the mock and actual observations is degenerate with respect to these factors; (ii) the multiwavelength spectrum above 0.1 GHz is in agreement with the radio observations and its slope is also only weakly sensitive to the magnetic field strength; (iii) the magnetic field direction exhibits X-shaped morphology, often seen in edge-on galaxies, which is consistent with the observations and indicates the presence of a galactic-scale outflow. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating advanced cosmic ray transport models in simulations and provide a deeper understanding of galactic wind dynamics and its impact on galaxy evolution.

<title>Two Intermittent Eruptions of a Minifilament Triggered by a Two-step Magnetic Reconnection Within a Fan-spine Configuration</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad84f9</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad84f9</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Although numerous works have concentrated on minifilament eruption in complex configurations, the detailed triggering mechanism is still an open question. Using the observational data from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope and Solar Dynamics Observatory, we studied a two-step magnetic reconnection process that triggered a minifilament that erupted intermittently within a fan-spine structure in the active region NOAA 13272. The first-step reconnection occurred between a set of low-lying small-scale magnetic loops and their nearby inner spine, resulting in the appearance of a brightening at the reconnection site and the reconfiguration of the inner spine. As the reconfigured inner spine approached the outer spine, reconnection occurred between them at the null point and led to the minifilament erupting partially. Subsequently, this two-step reconnection scenario occurred again and triggered the minifilament to erupt completely. The null point reconnection was supported by the changes in the topological structure of the inner spine and the outer spine, circular ribbon flares, remote brightenings, and the brightening of the outer spine. The null point reconnection related to the second eruption was also confirmed by some plasmoids expelled from the reconnection site. Further, the results of the magnetic field extrapolation reveal the existence of a fan-spine structure involving a three-dimensional null point. We suggest that the two-step reconnection triggers the two eruptions, in which the null point reconnection plays a direct role, but the dynamical evolution of the inner spine and the outer spine driven by the first-step reconnection might be a precursor of the subsequent null point reconnection.

<title>Photospheric Hot Spots at Solar Coronal Loop Footpoints Revealed by Hyperspectral Imaging Observations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8564</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8564</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Poynting flux generated by random shuffling of photospheric magnetic footpoints is transferred through the upper atmosphere of the Sun where the plasma is heated to over 1 MK in the corona. High spatiotemporal resolution observations of the lower atmosphere at the base of coronal magnetic loops are crucial to better understand the nature of the footpoint dynamics and the details of magnetic processes that eventually channel energy into the corona. Here, we report high spatial resolution (∼0.″1) and cadence (1.33 s) hyperspectral imaging of the solar Hα line, acquired by the Microlensed Hyperspectral Imager prototype installed at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope, that reveal photospheric hot spots at the base of solar coronal loops. These hot spots manifest themselves as Hα wing enhancements, occurring on small spatial scales of ∼0.″2, and timescales of less than 100 s. By assuming that the Hα wings and the continuum form under the local thermodynamic equilibrium condition, we inverted the Hα line profiles and found that the hot spots are compatible with a temperature increase of about 1000 K above the ambient quiet-Sun temperature. The Hα wing integrated Stokes V/I maps indicate that hot spots are related to magnetic patches with field strengths comparable to or even stronger that the surrounding network elements. But they do not show the presence of parasitic polarity magnetic field that would support the interpretation that these hot spots are reconnection-driven Ellerman bombs. Therefore, we interpret these features as proxies of locations where convection-driven magnetic field intensification in the photosphere can lead to energy transfer into higher layers. We suggest that such hot spots at coronal loop footpoints may be indicative of the specific locations and onset of energy flux injection into the upper atmosphere.

<title>Exploring the Small-scale Magnetic Fields of the Solar Analog KIC 8006161 Using Asteroseismology</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The magnetic field is a significant and universal physical phenomenon in modern astrophysics. Small-scale magnetic fields are very important in the stellar atmosphere. They are ubiquitous and strongly couple with acoustic waves. Therefore, their presence affects the properties of acoustic waves in the stellar outer layer. In the present work, under the assumption that small-scale magnetic features are the cause of the asteroseismic surface term (the frequency-dependent frequency offset between stars and their models), we explore the strength of such fields in the solar analog KIC 8006161. By considering the effect of small-scale magnetic fields in the stellar photosphere, we use the observed oscillation frequencies to constrain the inner structures and surface small-scale magnetic fields of solar-like star KIC 8006161. To agree with the existing observations, such as oscillation frequencies, and their frequency separation ratios, the theoretical model requires a small-scale magnetic field to form a magnetic-arch splicing layer in the stellar outer atmosphere. The small-scale magnetic field strengths for KIC 8006161 obtained from best-fit model with Yinit = 0.249 + 1.33 Zinit and Yinit as a free parameter are approximately 96 and 89 G, respectively. The corresponding locations of the magnetic-arch splicing layer are about 522 and 510 km, respectively.

<div> LBVs, sgB[e] stars, Gaia Data Release 3, proper-motion velocities, massive binaries
<br /><br />总结: 该研究利用Gaia Data Release 3测量了大麦哲伦云（LMC）和小麦哲伦云（SMC）中LBVs和sgB[e]超巨星的固有运动速度，发现LBVs和sgB[e]星被认为是不同的类别。Class 1 LBVs和sgB[e]星的速度分布类似于SMC领域的OBe星，表明它们可能受到了超新星的踢。然而，Class 2 LBVs没有显示出加速的迹象，这表明它们可能是单颗星，超新星前联星，或者可能是双星的合并体。此外，候选的LBV Class 3星被确认为sgB[e]星，它们可能代表sgB[e]类中最明亮和最质量大的一类。同时，SMC中的sgB[e]星速度比LMC中的更快，这可能与低金属licity双星更紧凑，导致更快的喷射速度相关。值得注意的是，特殊类别的无尘、弱线sgB[e]星具有整个样本中最快的速度。 <div>
Recent work suggests that many luminous blue variables (LBVs) and B[e] supergiants (sgB[e]) are isolated, implying that they may be products of massive binaries, kicked by partner supernovae. However, the evidence is somewhat complex and controversial. To test this scenario, we measure the proper-motion velocities for these objects in the LMC and SMC, using Gaia Data Release 3. Our LMC results show that the kinematics, luminosities, and IR properties point to LBVs and sgB[e] stars being distinct classes. We find that Class 1 LBVs, which have dusty nebulae, and sgB[e] stars both show velocity distributions comparable to that of SMC field OBe stars, which are known to have experienced SN kicks. The sgB[e] stars are faster, plausibly due to their lower average masses. However, Class 2 LBVs, which are luminous objects without dusty nebulae, show no signs of acceleration, therefore suggesting that they are single stars, pre-SN binaries, or perhaps binary mergers. The candidate LBV Class 3 stars, which are dominated by hot dust, are all confirmed sgB[e] stars; their luminosities and velocities show that they simply represent the most luminous and massive of the sgB[e] class. There are very few SMC objects, but the sgB[e] stars are faster than their LMC counterparts, which may be consistent with expectations that lower-metallicity binaries are tighter, causing faster ejections. We also examine the distinct class of dust-free, weak-lined sgB[e] stars, finding that the SMC objects have the fastest velocities of the entire sample.

<title>Low [O/Fe] Ratio in a Luminous Galaxy at the Early Cosmic Epoch (z > 10): Signature of Short Delay Time or Bright Hypernovae/Pair-instability Supernovae?</title>

<div> 关键词: GN-z11, [O/Fe] ratio, JWST/NIRSpec data, Fe-rich abundance, early universe

GN-z11是一个远距离的宇宙星系，研究发现其铁含量丰富的氧/铁比率表明铁的丰富度可能不是由Ia型超新星所导致的。这与大爆炸后早期（约430百万年）和第一次恒星形成（可能约200百万年）的时间线相吻合。这一发现提示，铁的丰富可能是由明亮的超新星和/或双星不稳定超新星所导致的。此外，这一研究也支持了该星系与球状星团之间的连接，尤其是在氮含量较高的情况下。总结:

GN-z11是遥远的星系，在其探索中发现了铁含量丰富的氧/铁比率，表明铁的丰富可能不是由Ia型超新星所导致的；
铁的丰富可能是由明亮的超新星和/或双星不稳定超新星所导致的，这与大爆炸后早期和第一次恒星形成的时间线相吻合；
该研究也支持了该星系与球状星团之间的连接，尤其是在氮含量较高的情况下。 <div>
We present an [O/Fe] ratio of a luminous galaxy GN-z11 at z = 10.60 derived with the deep public JWST/NIRSpec data. We fit the medium-resolution grating (G140M, G235M, and G395M) data with the model spectra consisting of BPASS-stellar and Cloudy-nebular spectra in the rest-frame UV wavelength ranges with Fe absorption lines, carefully masking the other emission and absorption lines in the same manner as previous studies conducted for lower-redshift (z ∼ 2–6) galaxies with oxygen abundance measurements. We obtain an Fe-rich abundance ratio , which is confirmed with the independent deep prism data as well as by the classic 1978 index method. This [O/Fe] measurement is lower than that measured for star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 2–3. Because z = 10.60 is an early epoch after the Big Bang (∼430 Myr) and the first star formation (likely ∼200 Myr), it is difficult to produce Fe by Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), which requires sufficient delay time for white-dwarf formation and gas accretion. The Fe-rich abundance ratio in GN-z11 suggests that the delay time is short or that the major Fe enrichment is not accomplished by SNe Ia but by bright hypernovae (BrHNe) and/or pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), where the yield models of BrHNe and PISNe explain Fe, Ne, and O abundance ratios of GN-z11. The [O/Fe] measurement is not too low to rule out the connection between GN-z11 and globular clusters (GCs) previously suggested by the nitrogen abundance but rather supports the connection with a GC population at high [N/O] if a metal dilution process exists.

Quantifying the energy content of accelerated electron beams during solar eruptive events is a key outstanding objective that must be constrained to refine particle acceleration models and understand the electron component of space weather. Previous estimations have used in situ measurements near the Earth, and consequently suffer from electron-beam propagation effects. In this study, we deduce properties of a rapid sequence of escaping electron beams that were accelerated during a solar flare on 2013 May 22 and produced type III radio bursts, including the first estimate of energy density from remote-sensing observations. We use extreme-ultraviolet observations to infer the magnetic structure of the source active region NOAA 11745, and Nançay Radioheliograph imaging spectroscopy to estimate the speed and origin of the escaping electron beams. Using the observationally deduced electron-beam properties from the type III bursts and cotemporal hard X-rays, we simulate electron-beam properties to estimate the electron number density and energy in the acceleration region. We find an electron density (above 30 keV) in the acceleration region of 102.5 cm−3 and an energy density of 2 × 10−5 erg cm−3. Radio observations suggest the particles travelled a very short distance before they began to produce radio emission, implying a radially narrow acceleration region. A short but plausibly wide slab-like acceleration volume of 1026–1028 cm3 atop the flaring loop arcade could contain a total energy of 1023–1025 erg (∼100 beams), which is comparable to energy estimates from previous studies.

Overcoming both modeling and computational challenges, we present, for the first time, the extended surface-brightness distribution model of a strongly lensed source in a complex galaxy-cluster-scale system. We exploit the high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging and extensive Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer spectroscopy to build an extended strong-lensing model, in a full multiplane formalism, of SDSS J1029+2623, a lens cluster at z = 0.588 with three multiple images of a background quasar (z = 2.1992). Going beyond typical cluster strong-lensing modeling techniques, we include as observables both the positions of 26 pointlike multiple images from seven background sources, spanning a wide redshift range between 1.02 and 5.06, and the extended surface-brightness distribution of the strongly lensed quasar host galaxy, over ∼78,000 HST pixels. In addition, we model the light distribution of seven objects, angularly close to the strongly lensed quasar host, over ∼9300 HST pixels. Our extended lens model reproduces well both the observed intensity and morphology of the quasar host galaxy in the HST F160W band (with a 0.″03 pixel scale). The reconstructed source shows a single, compact, and smooth surface-brightness distribution, for which we estimate an intrinsic magnitude of 23.3 ± 0.1 in the F160W band and a half-light radius of (2.39 ± 0.03) kpc. The increased number of observables enables the accurate determination of the total mass of line-of-sight halos lying angularly close to the extended arc. This work paves the way for a new generation of galaxy cluster strong-lens models, where additional, complementary lensing observables are directly incorporated as model constraints.

<div> SAGA Survey, satellite galaxies, star formation, quenched fraction, Milky Way analogs
总结: 该研究通过SAGA Survey对101个银河系模拟体周围的378个卫星星系的恒星形成特性进行了调查，重点关注了环境过程对星形成的抑制或熄灭作用。研究发现，SAGA卫星星系的熄灭比例随着恒星质量的减小而增加，并且在不同系统之间具有显著的差异。此外，熄灭比例在主体星系的中心100千秒差距内最高，在维里半径外下降。同时，研究还表明低质量卫星星系和距主星系内部100千秒差距的卫星星系更容易被熄灭。此外，研究还发现在具有较大主星系暗物质晕的系统中，熄灭比例较高。这些结果揭示了在类似银河系的环境中，对卫星星系星形成的抑制过程会相对缓慢地作用，从而在所有恒星质量和投影半径上保留一定数量的星形成卫星星系。 <div>
We present the star-forming properties of 378 satellite galaxies around 101 Milky Way analogs in the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey, focusing on the environmental processes that suppress or quench star formation. In the SAGA stellar mass range of 106−10M⊙, we present quenched fractions, star-forming rates, gas-phase metallicities, and gas content. The fraction of SAGA satellites that are quenched increases with decreasing stellar mass and shows significant system-to-system scatter. SAGA satellite quenched fractions are highest in the central 100 kpc of their hosts and decline out to the virial radius. Splitting by specific star formation rate (sSFR), the least star-forming satellite quartile follows the radial trend of the quenched population. The median sSFR of star-forming satellites increases with decreasing stellar mass and is roughly constant with projected radius. Star-forming SAGA satellites are consistent with the star formation rate–stellar mass relationship determined in the Local Volume, while the median gas-phase metallicity is higher and median H i gas mass is lower at all stellar masses. We investigate the dependence of the satellite quenched fraction on host properties. Quenched fractions are higher in systems with larger host halo mass, but this trend is only seen in the inner 100 kpc; we do not see significant trends with host color or star formation rate. Our results suggest that lower-mass satellites and satellites inside 100 kpc are more efficiently quenched in a Milky Way–like environment, with these processes acting sufficiently slowly to preserve a population of star-forming satellites at all stellar masses and projected radii.

总结: SAGA Survey DR3是一项对银河系质量星系周围卫星进行光谱调查的调查，包括101个银河系质量星系中发现的378颗卫星，并附带了84.7平方度的背景星系的红移目录。根据详细的完整性模型，样本占到94%的真实卫星总数。研究发现，SAGA系统中最大卫星的质量是卫星数量最强的预测因素之一，而银河系质量星系中有1/3包含大麦哲伦云质量的卫星。此外，SAGA卫星的径向分布较银河系更不集中，而在低于10^8.5太阳质量范围内的停滞分数也较低。此外，SAGA卫星没有表现出明显的共转信号，而银河系则与SAGA系统的散射范围相符。这些差异可以通过假设银河系是一个年龄较大、略微较轻的宿主星系，并最近吸收了大、小麦哲伦云系统来得到解释。 <div>
We present Data Release 3 (DR3) of the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey, a spectroscopic survey characterizing satellite galaxies around Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies. The SAGA Survey DR3 includes 378 satellites identified across 101 MW-mass systems in the distance range of 25–40.75 Mpc, and an accompanying redshift catalog of background galaxies (including about 46,000 taken by SAGA) in the SAGA footprint of 84.7 deg2. The number of confirmed satellites per system ranges from zero to 13, in the stellar mass range of 106−10M⊙. Based on a detailed completeness model, this sample accounts for 94% of the true satellite population down to M⋆ = 107.5M⊙. We find that the mass of the most massive satellite in SAGA systems is the strongest predictor of satellite abundance; one-third of the SAGA systems contain LMC-mass satellites, and they tend to have more satellites than the MW. The SAGA satellite radial distribution is less concentrated than the MW's, and the SAGA quenched fraction below 108.5M⊙ is lower than the MW's, but in both cases, the MW is within 1σ of SAGA system-to-system scatter. SAGA satellites do not exhibit a clear corotating signal as has been suggested in the MW/M31 satellite systems. Although the MW differs in many respects from the typical SAGA system, these differences can be reconciled if the MW is an older, slightly less massive host with a recently accreted LMC/SMC system.

本文利用UniverseMachine（UM）银河-暗物质晕的联系框架和SAGA调查的数据，将矮星系的星体形成和熄灭置于宇宙学背景中。使用UM作为一个数据驱动的前向模型，灵活地参数化星系的星体形成速率，仅利用暗物质晕的质量和演化历史。我们为UM添加了一个新的熄灭模型，针对质量小于10^9太阳质量的星系，并使用SAGA对银河系质量宿主周围的101个卫星系统的新观测数据以及来自斯隆数字天文调查在相似质量范围内的孤立场星系样本，将模型限制到质量大于10^7太阳质量的范围。新的最佳拟合模型“UM-SAGA”能够复现SAGA卫星的星体质量函数、平均星体形成速率和熄灭比例，同时保持孤立矮星体多数处于星体形成状态。卫星相对于孤立场星系的增强熄灭导致了模型最大程度地依赖晕体的演化来解释观测到的环境熄灭。将模型推广到质量约10^6.5太阳质量时，孤立场星系的熄灭比例为至少30%，而银河系质量宿主的卫星在这个星体质量下的熄灭比例为至少80%。光谱调查很快可以检验这个具体的预测，以揭示内部反馈、质量和气体吸积的停止、卫星特有的气体过程和再电离对微弱低质量星系演化的相对重要性。<br /><br />总结: 本文利用UniverseMachine和SAGA Survey数据，对低质量星系的星体形成和熄灭进行了研究，提出了新的模型"UM-SAGA"并对其进行了验证，以解释观测到的环境熄灭现象，预测了未来光谱调查的可能结果。 <div>
Environment plays a critical role in shaping the assembly of low-mass galaxies. Here, we use the UniverseMachine (UM) galaxy–halo connection framework and Data Release 3 of the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey to place dwarf galaxy star formation and quenching into a cosmological context. UM is a data-driven forward model that flexibly parameterizes galaxy star formation rates (SFRs) using only halo mass and assembly history. We add a new quenching model to UM, tailored for galaxies with m⋆ ≲ 109M⊙, and constrain the model down to m⋆ ≳ 107M⊙ using new SAGA observations of 101 satellite systems around Milky Way (MW)–mass hosts and a sample of isolated field galaxies in a similar mass range from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The new best-fit model, “UM-SAGA,” reproduces the satellite stellar mass functions, average SFRs, and quenched fractions in SAGA satellites while keeping isolated dwarfs mostly star-forming. The enhanced quenching in satellites relative to isolated field galaxies leads the model to maximally rely on halo assembly to explain the observed environmental quenching. Extrapolating the model down to m⋆ ∼ 106.5M⊙ yields a quenched fraction of ≳30% for isolated field galaxies and ≳80% for satellites of MW-mass hosts at this stellar mass. Spectroscopic surveys can soon test this specific prediction to reveal the relative importance of internal feedback, cessation of mass and gas accretion, satellite-specific gas processes, and reionization for the evolution of faint low-mass galaxies.

<div> ALMA, protoplanetary disks, substructures, planet formation, UV environment
总结:ALMA探测到了σ Orionis中的八个恒星盘的高分辨率图像，显示出在受到中等级外部紫外辐射的盘中，存在着缺口和环结构。其中SO 1274盘内有五个间隔，几乎排成谐振链状。另外三个盘通过能见度的建模推断出存在间隔或肩状结构。然而，在该区域，盘的大小较小，因此50 au以外的毫米连续间隔很少，可能是由于外部光蚀或年龄效应。 <div>
The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has detected substructures in numerous protoplanetary disks at radii from a few to over 100 au. These substructures are commonly thought to be associated with planet formation, either by serving as sites fostering planetesimal formation or by arising as a consequence of planet–disk interactions. Our current understanding of substructures, though, is primarily based on observations of nearby star-forming regions with mild UV environments, whereas stars are typically born in much harsher UV environments, which may inhibit planet formation in the outer disk through external photoevaporation. We present high-resolution (∼8 au) ALMA 1.3 mm continuum images of eight disks in σ Orionis, a cluster irradiated by an O9.5 star. Gaps and rings are resolved in the images of five disks. The most striking of these is SO 1274, which features five gaps that appear to be arranged nearly in a resonant chain. In addition, we infer the presence of gap or shoulder-like structures in the other three disks through visibility modeling. These observations indicate that substructures robustly form and survive at semimajor axes of several tens of au or less in disks exposed to intermediate levels of external UV radiation as well as in compact disks. However, our observations also suggest that disks in σ Orionis are mostly small, and thus millimeter continuum gaps beyond a disk radius of 50 au are rare in this region, possibly due to either external photoevaporation or age effects.

总结:<br /><br />这项研究提出了火管不稳定性和压缩加热可以推动碰撞等离子体环境中的超阿尔文尼克喷流的理论证据。通过对MMS任务观测到的准平行磁层喷流进行分析，发现约11%的等离子体测量显示火管不稳定性。这些发现解释了低（β < 1）和高（β > 1）贝塔等离子体中快速下游流的形成，并提供了新的证据表明动力学过程对于准确描述磁层喷流的形成和演变至关重要。 <div>
Super-Alfvénic jets, with kinetic energy densities significantly exceeding that of the solar wind, are commonly generated downstream of Earth's bow shock under both high- and low-beta plasma conditions. In this study, we present theoretical evidence that these enhanced kinetic energy flows can be driven by firehose-unstable fluctuations and compressive heating within collisionless plasma environments. Using a fluid formalism that incorporates pressure anisotropy, we estimate that the downstream flow of a collisionless plasma shock can be accelerated by a factor of 2–4 following the compression and saturation of firehose instability. By analyzing quasi-parallel magnetosheath jets observed in situ by the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission, we find that approximately 11% of plasma measurements within these jets exhibit firehose-unstable fluctuations. Our findings offer an explanation for the distinctive generation of fast downstream flows in both low (β < 1) and high (β > 1) beta plasmas, and provide new evidence that kinetic processes are crucial for accurately describing the formation and evolution of magnetosheath jets.

本研究采用了一种参数化模型，将基础星体和核聚变物理参数化，并得出了残余黑洞分布。我们将初始质量和残余黑洞质量的映射应用于脉冲对撞不稳定超新星（PPISN）过程，得出了对该过程反应速率的限制。我们的结果表明，目前的数据与核心-残余质量关系的红移演化一致，但对这些参数的变化仅有较弱的约束。根据先前的结果，我们认为在约35 M⊙处观测到的峰值不太可能是目前理解的PPISN过程的特征。这种方法可以应用于对天体物理分布的任何物理过程的建模。 <br /><br />总结: 参数化模型得出残余黑洞分布，将初始质量和残余黑洞质量的映射应用于脉冲对撞不稳定超新星（PPISN）过程，得出了对该过程反应速率的限制。目前的数据与核心-残余质量关系的红移演化一致，但对这些参数的变化仅有较弱的约束。根据先前的结果，我们认为在约35 M⊙处观测到的峰值不太可能是目前理解的PPISN过程的特征。 <div>
Gravitational-wave observations of binary black holes have revealed unexpected structure in the black hole mass distribution. Previous studies employ physically motivated phenomenological models and infer the parameters that control the features of the mass distribution that are allowed in their model, associating the constraints on those parameters with their physical motivations a posteriori. In this work, we take an alternative approach in which we introduce a model parameterizing the underlying stellar and core-collapse physics and obtaining the remnant black hole distribution as a derived by-product. In doing so, we constrain the stellar physics necessary to explain the astrophysical distribution of black hole properties under a given model. We apply this to the mapping between initial mass and remnant black hole mass, accounting for mass-dependent mass loss using a simple parameterized description. Allowing the parameters of the initial mass–remnant mass relationship to evolve with redshift permits correlated and physically reasonable changes to features in the mass function. We find that the current data are consistent with no redshift evolution in the core–remnant mass relationship, but place only weak constraints on the change of these parameters. This procedure can be applied to modeling any physical process underlying the astrophysical distribution. We illustrate this by applying our model to the pulsational pair instability supernova (PPISN) process, previously proposed as an explanation for the observed excess of black holes at ∼35 M⊙. Placing constraints on the reaction rates necessary to explain the PPISN parameters, we concur with previous results in the literature that the peak observed at ∼35 M⊙ is unlikely to be a signature from the PPISN process as presently understood.

总结: 本文研究了外星系γ射线天空的特征，发现了大量的γ射线检测到的偏向视线角度的活跃星系核。通过对射电形态的系统研究，发现了149个γ射线检测到的偏向活跃星系核，三倍于以往数量。这些样本有各种射电形态，可以用来探讨相对论性喷流和射电叶的高能辐射机制，研究AGN的统一模型。<br /><br /> <div>
The extragalactic γ-ray sky is dominated by relativistic jets aligned to the observer’s line of sight, i.e., blazars. A few of their misaligned counterparts, e.g., radio galaxies, are also detected with the Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT), albeit in a small number (∼50), indicating the crucial role played by the jet viewing angle in detecting γ-ray emission from jets. These γ-ray emitting misaligned active galactic nuclei (AGN) provide us with a unique opportunity to understand the high-energy emission production mechanisms from a different viewpoint than the more common blazars. With this goal in mind, we have systematically studied the radio morphology of γ-ray emitting sources present in the fourth data release of the fourth catalog of Fermi-LAT detected γ-ray sources to identify misaligned AGN. By utilizing the high-resolution and sensitive MHz and GHz frequency observations delivered by the Very Large Array Sky Survey, Low-Frequency Array Two-metre Sky Survey, Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters, and Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey, here we present a catalog of 149 γ-ray detected misaligned AGN, thus approximately tripling the number of known objects of this class. Our sample includes a variety of radio morphologies, e.g., edge-darkened and edge-brightened, hybrids, wide-angle-tailed, bent jets, and giants. Since the γ-ray emission is thought to be highly sensitive to the jet viewing angle, such an enlarged sample of γ-ray detected misaligned radio sources will permit us to explore the origin of high-energy emission in relativistic jets and radio lobes and study AGN unification, in general.

<div> 关键词: optical coronal lines, AGNs, photoionization calculations, dust, early Universe <br />
总结: 该研究通过光电离计算和天体物理云谱综合模型研究了高电离电位禁态碰撞激发光学原子跃迁，即光学冠线。研究发现，尘埃会减弱大部分光学冠线的强度，而低电离电位的光学线受到的影响较小，甚至在尘埃气体中得到增强。此外，研究还指出光学冠线可能在无尘气体中更加明显，并且在辐射场硬的星系中表现更强。最后，文章提到在早期宇宙（如使用JWST观测）中并未广泛观测到光学冠线，这可能指向在高红移处尘埃的快速形成。 <br /> <div>
Forbidden collisionally excited optical atomic transitions from high-ionization-potential (IP ≥ 54.8 eV) ions, such as Ca4+, Ne4+, Fe6+, Fe10+, Fe13+, Ar9+, and S11+, are known as optical coronal lines (CLs). The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) typically extend to hundreds of electron volts and above, which should be able to produce such highly ionized gas. However, optical CLs are often not detected in AGNs. Here we use photoionization calculations with the cloudy spectral synthesis code to determine possible reasons for the rarity of these optical CLs. We calculate CL luminosities and equivalent widths from radiation-pressure-confined photoionized gas slabs exposed to an AGN continuum. We consider the role of dust, metallicity, and ionizing SED in the formation of optical CLs. We find that (i) dust reduces the strength of most CLs by ∼3 orders of magnitude, primarily as a result of depletion of metals onto the dust grains; (ii) in contrast to the CLs, the more widely observed lower-IP optical lines such as [O iii] 5007 Å are less affected by depletion, and some are actually enhanced in dusty gas; and (iii) many optical CLs become detectable in dustless gas, and are particularly strong for a hard ionizing SED. This implies that prominent CL emission likely originates in dustless gas. Our calculations also suggest optical CL emission is enhanced in galaxies with low-mass black holes characterized by a harder radiation field and a low dust-to-metals ratio. The fact that optical CLs are not widely observed in the early Universe with JWST may point to rapid dust formation at high redshift.

<div> 关键词: 超大质量黑洞双星，引力波，脉冲星定时阵列，宇宙融合，电磁辐射

总结: 
超大质量黑洞双星（SMBHBs）是在星系合并中形成的，可以产生可用脉冲星定时阵列（PTAs）探测的引力波（GWs）以及电磁（EM）辐射。一旦探测到来自单独的SMBHBs的GWs，由于PTAs的定位能力和可能的EM签名的模糊性，确定宿主星系将是一个重大挑战。研究使用NANOGrav的星系目录，量化了在现实和理想情况下可能的宿主数量。文章详细描述了宿主识别流程并进行了模拟实验，结果显示在理想情况下90%的可信区域为29-241 deg2，包含约14-341个星系。在现实情况下，这个区域为287-530 deg2，包含285-1238个星系。最后根据GW搜索的参数估计进行了星系筛选，最终剩下的星系数量范围为22-1个（理想情况）和397-27个（现实情况）。发现信噪比是决定定位区域的主要因素，但区域还受天空中附近脉冲星的距离和双星啁啾质量的影响。 <br /><br /> <div>
Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are thought to form in galaxy mergers, possessing the potential to produce electromagnetic (EM) radiation as well as gravitational waves (GWs) detectable with pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). Once GWs from individually resolved SMBHBs are detected, the identification of the host galaxy will be a major challenge due to the ambiguity in possible EM signatures and the poor localization capability of PTAs. To aid EM observations in choosing follow-up sources, we use NANOGrav’s galaxy catalog to quantify the number of plausible hosts in both realistic and idealistic scenarios. We outline a host identification pipeline that injects a single-source GW signal into a simulated PTA data set, recovers the signal using production-level techniques, quantifies the localization region and number of galaxies contained therein, and finally imposes cuts on the galaxies using parameter estimates from the GW search. In an ideal case, the 90% credible areas span 29–241 deg2, containing about 14–341 galaxies. After cuts, the number of galaxies remaining ranges from 22 at worst to one true host at best. In a realistic case, these areas range from 287 to 530 deg2 and enclose about 285–1238 galaxies. After cuts, the number of galaxies is 397 at worst and 27 at best. While the signal-to-noise ratio is the primary determinant of the localization area of a given source, we find that the area is also influenced by the proximity to nearby pulsars on the sky and the binary chirp mass.

We propose a novel approach to the detection of point-like sources of high-energy neutrinos. Motivated by evidence for emerging sources in existing data, we focus on the characterization and interpretation of these sources rather than the rejection of the background-only hypothesis. The hierarchical Bayesian model is implemented in the Stan platform, enabling computation of the posterior distribution with a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm. We simulate a population of weak neutrino sources detected by the IceCube experiment and use the resulting data set to demonstrate and validate our framework. We show that even for the challenging case of sources at the threshold of detection and using limited prior information, it is possible to correctly infer the source properties. Additionally, we demonstrate how modeling flexible connections between similar sources can be used to recover the contribution of sources that would not be detectable individually. While a direct comparison of our method to existing approaches is challenged by the fundamental differences in frequentist and Bayesian frameworks, we draw parallels where possible. In particular, we highlight how including more complexity into the source modeling can increase the sensitivity to sources and their populations.

CME-CME相互作用是太空天气研究的关键领域，在较少探讨的CME-CME相互作用和它们对地磁的影响方面尤为重要。本研究利用空间天气自适应模拟框架，在真实太阳风条件下进行了一系列CME-CME相互作用场景的3D磁流体动力学模拟。重点关注CME的初始磁通、速度、密度和倾斜角的动力学特性，以及它们对扰动暴风指数（Dst）的单独和联合影响。此外，对领先CME的运动学、磁场和结构影响以及两个CME的混合也进行了分析。通过虚拟航天器在1天文单位处沿不同经度的时间序列原位研究进行了研究。研究结果显示，由于不均匀的环境太阳风条件，CME-CME相互作用在不同经度上是不均匀的。由于与跟随CME的碰撞，领先CME的动量和动能显著增加，同时在强相互作用的情况下会形成逆冲击。这些逆冲击导致CME2内部产生复杂的波动模式，这可能会延长风暴恢复阶段。此外，我们观察到，最小的Dst值随着后续CME的初始密度、倾斜角和速度的增加而减小。 <br /><br />总结: CME-CME相互作用对地磁环境有重要影响，特别是在不同的太阳风条件下表现出不同的效果。相互作用会导致领先CME的动能增加和逆冲击的形成，进而延长风暴恢复阶段。此外，后续CME的初始参数也会影响风暴的严重程度。 <div>
The geo-effectiveness of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is a critical area of study in space weather, particularly in the lesser-explored domain of CME–CME interactions and their geomagnetic consequences. This study leverages the Space Weather Adaptive SimulaTion framework to perform 3D MHD simulation of a range of CME–CME interaction scenarios within realistic solar wind conditions. The focus is on the dynamics of the initial magnetic flux, speed, density, and tilt of CMEs, and their individual and combined impacts on the disturbance storm time (Dst) index. Additionally, the kinematic, magnetic, and structural impacts on the leading CME, as well as the mixing of both CMEs, are analyzed. Time-series in situ studies are conducted through virtual spacecraft positioned along three different longitudes at 1 au. Our findings reveal that CME–CME interactions are nonuniform along different longitudes, due to the inhomogeneous ambient solar wind conditions. A significant increase in the momentum and kinetic energy of the leading CME is observed due to collisions with the trailing CME, along with the formation of reverse shocks in cases of strong interaction. These reverse shocks lead to complex wave patterns inside CME2, which can prolong the storm recovery phase. Furthermore, we observe that the minimum Dst value decreases with an increase in the initial density, tilt, and speed of the trailing CME.

总结:<br /><br />本研究调查了一颗变相星系射电源（CLB）在长时间尺度上的演化，通过分析等价宽度和γ射线光子谱指数Γγ的关系，将其分为平谱射电类星体（FSRQ）状态，过渡状态和BL Lacertae（BL Lac）状态三种形态类型。我们获得了不同时期的多波段光变曲线和能谱分布。研究发现，在FSRQ状态下Γγ满足Γγ≳2.2，过渡状态下2.0<Γγ<2.2，BL Lac状态下Γγ≲2.0。我们将这一标准应用于CLB OQ 334在MJD 58678–60387期间的光子能谱演化，并将其划分为五个FSRQ状态，九个过渡状态和四个BL Lac状态。此外，我们使用各状态时段的模型光谱参数来验证细分形态类型的可靠性。结果显示：（1）获得了与我们早期研究一致的黑洞质量和吸积率参数；（2）BL Lac状态的时段有逐渐增加的趋势，即使FSRQ状态的时段并没有明显的减少趋势。我们提供了强有力的证据表明CLB是类星体演化中特殊的时期，可以从CLB演化中的振荡现象中获得。 <div>
We investigate the evolution of a changing-look blazar (CLB) on long timescales and expect to trace the state change of a CLB. Three morphological types, including a flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) state, transition state, and BL Lacertae (BL Lac) state, are classified according to the criteria proposed by analyzing the relationship between the equivalent width of the emission line and the γ-ray photon spectral index Γγ. The multiwavelength light curves and spectral energy distributions corresponding to different epochs are obtained. The efforts found that Γγ satisfy the relationships with Γγ ≳ 2.2 for the FSRQ state, 2.0 < Γγ < 2.2 for the transition state, and Γγ ≲ 2.0 for the BL Lac state. We apply the criteria to the photon spectrum evolution of CLB OQ 334 during MJD 58678–60387. The evolution is subdivided into five FSRQ states, nine transition states, and four BL Lac states. Moreover, we use the model spectra parameters of each state epoch to test the reliability of subdivided morphological types. The result shows that: (1) the accretion rate parameter is consistent with our earlier research; and (2) there is an increasing trend in the epochs of the BL Lac states, even if there is not an obvious decreasing trend in epochs of the FSRQ states. We issue strong evidence that a CLB is an especial epoch in the evolution of blazars that could be obtained from the oscillation phenomenon in the CLB evolution.

<br />总结:<br />GW150914标志着引力波时代的开始，直接探测了LIGO-Virgo GW探测器对双黑洞并合的信号。GW170817的短时伽马射线暴与多波段探测确立了紧凑天体并合是多信使事件。AstroSat-CZTI检测了超过650个伽马射线暴，并没有发现与90个GW事件同时发生的X射线对应物。这些上限能够约束理论模型，并讨论了在LVK探测器的第四次观测运行中未检测到BBH并合的可能性及其影响。 <div>
GW150914 marked the start of the gravitational wave (GW) era with the direct detection of a binary black hole (BBH) merger by the LIGO-Virgo GW detectors. The event was tentatively associated with a signal detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM), which hinted toward electromagnetic emission associated with compact object coalescence. The detection of a short gamma-ray burst (GRB) associated with GW170817, along with several multiwavelength detections, truly established that compact object mergers are indeed multimessenger events. The CadmiumZincTelluride Imager (CZTI) on board AstroSat can search for X-ray counterparts of the GW events and has detected over 650 GRBs in the 8.5 yr since it was launched. We present results from our searches for counterparts coincident with GW triggers from the first three LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) GW Transient Catalogs. For 71 out of 90 GW events for which AstroSat-CZTI data was available, we undertook a systematic search for temporally coincident transients in the 20–200 keV band and detected no X-ray counterparts. We evaluate the upper limits on the maximum possible flux from the source in a 100 s window centered around each trigger, consistent with the GW localization of the event. Thanks to the sensitivity of CZTI, these upper limits are competitive with those from other spacecraft. We use these upper limits to constrain theoretical models that predict high-energy counterparts to BBH mergers. We also discuss the probability of nondetections of BBH mergers at different luminosities and the implications of such nondetections from the ongoing fourth observing run of the LVK detectors.

<div> 快自转白矮星，X射线观测，磁场，CV，等离子体

总结:<br />
文章报告了对CTCV J2056-3014的X射线观测结果，该天体是一颗快自转的白矮星和CV。观测结果表明，这颗白矮星具有类似WZ Sge型CV的特性，并且在2022年11月发生了光学耀斑。X射线光谱表现为低等离子温度和无显著的低能吸收。研究人员使用非磁性和磁性CV光谱模型确定了白矮星质量范围，并发现其质量与局部CV的平均质量一致。这些观测结果对理解快自转白矮星和CV的性质具有重要意义。 <div>
We report on XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and NICER X-ray observations of CTCV J2056–3014, a cataclysmic variable (CV) with one of the fastest-spinning white dwarfs (WDs) at P = 29.6 s. While previously classified as an intermediate polar, CJ2056 also exhibits the properties of WZ Sge–type CVs, such as dwarf novae and superoutbursts. With XMM-Newton and NICER, we detected the spin period up to ∼2 keV with 7σ significance. We constrained its derivative to s s−1 after correcting for binary orbital motion. The pulse profile is characterized by a single broad peak with ∼25% modulation. NuSTAR detected a fourfold increase in unabsorbed X-ray flux coincident with an optical flare, in 2022 November. The XMM-Newton and NICER X-ray spectra at 0.310 keV are best characterized by an absorbed, optically thin three-temperature thermal plasma model (kT = 0.3, 1.0, and 4.9 keV), while the NuSTAR spectra at 3–30 keV are best fit by a single-temperature thermal plasma model (kT = 8.4 keV), both with Fe abundance ZFe/Z⊙ = 0.3. CJ2056 exhibits similarities to other fast-spinning CVs, such as low plasma temperatures and no significant X-ray absorption at low energies. As the WD’s magnetic field strength is unknown, we applied both nonmagnetic and magnetic CV spectral models (MKCFLOW and MCVSPEC) to determine the WD mass. The derived WD mass range (M = 0.7–1.0 M⊙) is above the centrifugal breakup mass limit of 0.56 M⊙ and consistent with the mean WD mass of local CVs (M ≈ 0.8–0.9 M⊙).

<div> 活动星系核、分子环、气体吸收线、速度分解分析、Subaru望远镜
总结:
研究人员使用Subaru望远镜高分辨率光谱观测了四个超亮红外星系中的气体12CO rovibrational吸收线，发现每个过渡都有两至五个明显的速度分量，表明分子环具有颗粒结构。他们还发现，最内部的组分是以∣VLOS∣∼160-240公里/秒的速度流出，而外部组分则以更慢的速度流出或者向内落入。此外，他们观察到光谱线的性质表明最内部的组分可能是由密度较高的热颗粒组成，而外部组分则是由背景辐射激发的冷颗粒组成。这些观测结果揭示了星系核周围分子环的颗粒状和动态结构。 <div>
Determining the inner structure of the molecular torus around an active galactic nucleus is essential for understanding its formation mechanism. However, spatially resolving the torus is difficult because of its small size. To probe the clump conditions in the torus, we therefore perform the systematic velocity-decomposition analyses of the gaseous 12CO rovibrational absorption lines (v = 0 → 1, ΔJ = ±1) at λ ∼ 4.67 μm observed toward four (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies using the high-resolution (R ∼ 5000–10,000) spectroscopy from the Subaru Telescope. We find that each transition has two to five distinct velocity components with different line-of-sight (LOS) velocities (VLOS ∼ −240 to +100 km s−1) and dispersions (σV ∼ 15–190 km s−1), i.e., the components (a), (b), ⋯, beginning with the broadest one in each target, indicating that the tori have clumpy structures. By assuming a hydrostatic disk ( ), we find that the tori has dynamic inner structures, with the innermost component (a) outflowing with velocity ∣VLOS∣ ∼ 160–240 km s−1, and the outer components (b) and (c) outflowing more slowly or infalling with ∣VLOS∣ ≲ 100 km s−1. In addition, we find that the innermost component (a) can be attributed to collisionally excited hot (≳530 K) and dense ( ) clumps, based on the level populations. Conversely, the outer component (b) can be attributed to cold (∼30–140 K) clumps radiatively excited by a far-infrared-to-submillimeter background with a brightness temperature higher than ∼20–400 K. These observational results demonstrate the clumpy and dynamic structure of tori in the presence of background radiation.

总结: 
本研究通过在16极射频离子陷阱中测量，展示了CN-和C3N-与原子氢的温度相关反应速率系数，在7至290K的温度范围内。C3N-与H的反应速率随着温度降低而稳步增加，而CN-+H系统的速率系数在约160K时突然改变。对数据进行拟合以确定温度相关的反应速率系数。拟合结果显示C3N-+H的速率系数为cm3 s-1。对于CN-，我们在160K以下温度范围内确定了cm3 s-1的速率系数。根据我们目前的结果，在模拟涉及这些H原子反应的冷星际环境时，必须假定比先前报告的更高的速率系数。<br /><br /> <div>
We present the temperature-dependent reaction rate coefficients of CN− and C3N− with atomic hydrogen in the temperature range from 7 to 290 K, measured in a 16-pole radio-frequency ion trap. The rate of C3N− with H steadily increases toward lower temperatures, while the rate coefficients for the CN− + H system show a sudden change around 160 K. Fits to the data were performed to determine temperature-dependent reaction rate coefficients. The fits reveal a rate coefficient of cm3 s−1 for C3N− + H. For CN−, we determined a rate coefficient for the temperature regime below 160 K of cm3 s−1. Given our present results, higher rate coefficients than previously reported must be assumed for the modeling of cold interstellar environments involving these H atom reactions.

<div> X-ray luminosity functions, hot gas, redshift evolution, normal galaxies, missing baryon problem
<br /><br />
本文研究了普通星系中约107K的热气体在红移z=0.5（回溯时间=5Gyr）时的演变，利用来自五个高银纬Chandra广域调查中检测到的575个红移z<0.6的普通星系样本构建了X射线光度函数（XLFs）。在估计了热气体成分的发射量后（约减样本至400个星系），我们比较了三个红移区间（z=0.1，0.3和0.5）的XLF，发现每单位共动体积内的星系数量从z=0.1到0.3，然后从z=0.3到0.5有所增加。这些XLF变化表明了热气体的显著（约5σ）X射线光度演变，其LX,GAS在过去5Gyr（从z=0.5到0.1）下降了6-10倍。更高红移处LX,GAS约为1041erg/s的星系的相对丰度表明，高红移、中等LX,GAS的星系可能是解决缺失重子问题的最佳目标。在早型星系中，这一观测趋势在定性上与（但更大于）无活动星系核反馈的冷却流模型中预期的时间依赖质量损失率一致。在晚型星系中，这一观测趋势也与（但更大于）z相关星形成率的影响在定性上一致。<br /><br />总结: 本文通过研究X射线光度函数揭示了普通星系中热气体的演化规律，发现了热气体的X射线光度演变趋势，并提出高红移、中等X射线光度星系可能是解决缺失重子问题的重要目标。同时，本研究还发现了与现有理论模型一致但更大的演化趋势。 <div>
We explore the evolution of the ∼107 K hot gas in normal galaxies out to redshift = 0.5 (lookback time = 5 Gyr), using X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) built from a sample of 575 normal galaxies with z < 0.6 detected in five high-galactic-latitude Chandra wide-field surveys. After estimating the emission due to the hot gas component (reducing the sample to ∼400 galaxies), we compared the XLF in three redshift bins (z = 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5), finding increases in the number of galaxies per unit comoving volume from z = 0.1 to 0.3 and then from z = 0.3 to 0.5. These XLF changes suggest a significant (∼5σ) X-ray luminosity evolution of the hot gas, with LX,GAS decreasing by a factor of 6–10 in the last 5 Gyr (from z = 0.5 to 0.1). The relative abundance of LX,GAS ∼ 1041 erg s−1 galaxies at higher z suggests that high-z, moderate-LX,GAS galaxies may be the optimal target to solve the missing baryon problem. In early-type galaxies, this observational trend is qualitatively consistent with (but larger than) the expected time-dependent mass-loss rate in cooling flow models without active galactic nucleus feedback. In late-type galaxies, the observational trend is also qualitatively consistent with (but larger than) the effect of the z-dependent star formation rate.

We used new high spectral resolution observations of propynal (HCCCHO) toward TMC-1 and in the laboratory to update the spectral line catalog available for transitions of HCCCHO—specifically at frequencies lower than 30 GHz, which were previously discrepant in a publicly available catalog. The observed astronomical frequencies provided a high enough spectral resolution that, when combined with high-resolution (∼2 kHz) measurements taken in the laboratory, a new, consistent fit to both the laboratory and astronomical data was achieved. Now with a nearly exact (<1 kHz) frequency match to the J = 2–1 and 3–2 transitions in the astronomical data, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, a best fit to the total HCCCHO column density of cm−2 was found with a surprisingly low excitation temperature of just over 3 K. This column density is around a factor of 5 times larger than reported in previous studies. Finally, this work highlights that care is needed when using publicly available spectral catalogs to characterize astronomical spectra. The availability of these catalogs is essential to the success of modern astronomical facilities and will only become more important as the next generation of facilities comes online.

Close binary systems are the progenitors to both Type Ia supernovae and the compact object mergers that can be detected via gravitational waves. To achieve a binary with a small radial separation, it is believed that the system likely undergoes common envelope (CE) evolution. Despite its importance, CE evolution may be one of the largest uncertainties in binary evolution due to a combination of computational challenges and a lack of observed benchmarks where both the post-CE and pre-CE conditions are known. Identifying post-CE systems in star clusters can partially circumvent this second issue by providing an independent age constraint on the system. For the first time, we conduct a systematic search for white dwarf and main-sequence binary systems in 299 Milky Way open star clusters. Coupling Gaia DR3 photometry and kinematics with multiband photometry from Pan-STARRS1 and the Two Micron All Sky Survey, we apply a machine learning-based approach and find 52 high-probability candidates in 38 open clusters. For a subset of our systems, we present follow-up spectroscopy from the Gemini and Lick Observatories and archival light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, Kepler/K2, and the Zwicky Transient Facility. Examples of M dwarfs with hot companions are spectroscopically observed, along with regular system variability. While the kinematics of our candidates are consistent with their host clusters, some systems have spatial positions offset relative to their hosts, potentially indicative of natal kicks. Ultimately, this catalog is a first step to obtaining a set of observational benchmarks to better link post-CE systems to their pre-CE progenitors.

文章总结: <br /><br />这篇文章介绍了Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS)-InCLOSE研究的设计和首次结果。该研究旨在通过观测恒星质量、星际介质金属丰度等星系特性与内部星系尺度介质(CGM)的物理条件(如动力学和金属丰度)的关联性，直接观测星系尺度的重子循环。研究利用Keck/KCWI光学IFU对KBSS QSO进行深入点测，发现了超过15个新的谱线发射星系，并使用MOSFIRE进行了两个星系的近红外光谱确认。研究发现这两个星系具有不同的质量和发射性质，并通过对其中性相CGM和电离ISM进行分析，得出了各自的金属丰度、尘埃消光、高电离CGM等特性。这些结果支持了金属和尘埃从外流驱入CGM的假设，并且将全面探索这些情景。 <br /> <div>
We present the design and first results of the inner circumgalactic medium (CGM) of QSO line-of-sight emitting galaxies at z ∼ 2–3, Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS)-InCLOSE. The survey will connect galaxy properties (e.g., stellar mass M*, interstellar medium, hereafter ISM, metallicity) with the physical conditions of the inner CGM (e.g., kinematics, metallicity) to directly observe the galaxy-scale baryon cycle. We obtain deep Keck/KCWI optical IFU pointings of KBSS QSOs to discover new star-forming galaxies at small projected distances b ≲ 12″ (98 kpc, ), then obtain follow-up Keck/MOSFIRE near-IR spectra to confirm their redshifts. We leverage KBSS images and Keck/High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer QSO spectra to model stellar populations and inner CGM absorption. In this paper, we analyze two QSO fields and discover more than 15 new galaxies with KCWI, then use MOSFIRE for two galaxies Q2343-G1 (z = 2.43; G1) and Q2233-N1 (z = 3.15; N1), which are both associated with damped Lyα absorbers. We find that G1 has typical M*, UV/optical emission properties. N1 has lower M* with very strong nebular emission. We jointly analyze neutral phase CGM and ionized ISM in N/O (for the first time at this z), dust extinction, and high-ionization CGM finding that G1's CGM is metal poor and less evolved than its ISM, while N1's CGM and ISM abundances are comparable; their CGM shows ∼1 dex less dust extinction than the ISM; and G1's CGM has direct evidence of hot, metal-rich galactic outflow ejecta. These findings support that metals and dust are driven into the CGM from outflows, but may also be, e.g., stripped ISM gas or satellite enrichment. The full KBSS-InCLOSE sample will explore these scenarios.

Understanding the origins of massive black hole seeds and their coevolution with their host galaxy requires studying intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) and estimating their mass. However, measuring the masses of these IMBHs is challenging, due to the high-spatial-resolution requirement. Spectrophotometric reverberation monitoring is performed for a low-luminosity Seyfert 1 galaxy, NGC 4395, to measure the size of the broad-line region and black hole mass. The data were collected using the 1.3 m Devasthal fast optical telescope and 3.6 m Devasthal optical telescope at ARIES, Nainital, over two consecutive days in 2022 March. The analysis revealed strong emission lines in the spectra and light curves of the merged 5100 Å spectroscopic continuum flux (f5100) with the photometric continuum V band and Hα, with fractional variabilities of 6.38% and 6.31% respectively. In comparison to several previous studies with lag estimation <90 minutes, our calculated Hα lag supersedes them by minutes, using the ICCF and JAVELIN methods. The velocity dispersion (σline) of the broad-line clouds is measured to be km s−1, yielding a black hole mass of ∼ and an Eddington ratio of 0.06.

A rapidly rotating magnetar has long been assumed to inject energy into the ejecta through isotropic output energy in previous works. However, the output energy of a magnetar is anisotropic and a jet is generally presented in the rotational direction of a magnetar. In this paper, we present a consistent model of the energy injection from a magnetar, considering both the anisotropic magnetic dipole radiation and the jet’s ingredient (i.e., the late jet mentioned refers to the beamed magnetars wind). In the situation that the energy injection into the ejecta presents a significant effect on the ejecta’s emission, two facts are obtained. (1) For an observer in the equatorial direction, there is no significant difference between the light curves of the ejecta’s emission based on the consistent model and those obtained in previous works (i.e., based on the isotropic energy injection). (2) For an on jet-axis observer, however, the difference is significant, especially in the optical/U-band. If the jet is not present in the system, the rise of the optical/U-band light-curve is actually steeper than that in previous works because the output energy of the anisotropic magnetic dipole radiation is mainly in the equatorial direction. If the jet is present in the system, a bump from the cocoon (i.e., the late jet launch is expected to shock and heat-up the ejecta) may only appear in the optical/U-band light curve for a quasi-isotropic ejecta. Our results reveal that the anisotropic energy output of the magnetic dipole radiation and the jet’s ingredient should be well considered in modeling the ejecta emission by considering the energy injection from a magnetar. In addition, the optical/U-band light-curve may disclose the central engine of the burst.

This study examines the importance of the thermal effects of ambipolar diffusion (AD), by analyzing the governing properties in the middle and outer regions of a standard thin accretion disk with outflows. To accomplish this, we derive the nonideal magnetohydrodynamic equations, considering both the dynamical and thermal impacts of AD in these regions of the disk. In a stationary state, we utilize the self-similar technique to analyze the vertical structure of a disk with outflows and express the ambipolar diffusivity in terms of the Alfvén velocity and the Elsässer number. Our main focus is on the vertical temperature profile at large radii of the disk when the values of the Elsässer number are small. While the findings indicate that AD heating has minimal effects within the disk, it does play a critical role near the disk surface. When the Elsässer number is low, there is a notable rate of outflows and disk evaporation, resulting in angular momentum transport in these regions. This issue becomes important when we decrease the value of turbulent viscosity, as it leads to highlighting the AD heating effect. This allows the surface regions to become hotter and results in an increase in the drive of the outflows. The results of this research may be important for studying disk coronae and disk dispersal in the middle and outer regions of the thin accretion disk.

本研究使用了一系列不同的估计器来约束非高斯性，包括功率谱、三点相关函数、星系团质量函数、标记功率谱和标记三点相关函数等摘要统计量。我们进行了费歇尔分析，估计了它们的宇宙信息内容，并表明当标记观测量加入分析时有显著的改进。然后，我们使用深度神经网络进行对宇宙和非高斯参数的无似然推断。最后，我们发现在分析中，功率谱和合适的标记功率谱的组合优于功率谱和三点相关函数的组合。可以实施一个最小的管道来分析我们确定的统计量，无论是使用我们的机器学习算法还是更可靠的传统估计器。 <div>
We apply a suite of different estimators to the Quijote-png halo catalogs to find the best approach to constrain Primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) at nonlinear cosmological scales, up to . The set of summary statistics considered in our analysis includes the power spectrum, bispectrum, halo mass function, marked power spectrum, and marked modal bispectrum. Marked statistics are used here for the first time in the context of the PNG study. We perform a Fisher analysis to estimate their cosmological information content, showing substantial improvements when marked observables are added to the analysis. Starting from these summaries, we train deep neural networks to perform likelihood-free inference of cosmological and PNG parameters. We assess the performance of different subsets of summary statistics; in the case of , we find that a combination of the power spectrum and a suitable marked power spectrum outperforms the combination of power spectrum and bispectrum, the baseline statistics usually employed in PNG analysis. A minimal pipeline to analyze the statistics we identified can be implemented either with our ML algorithm or via more traditional estimators, if these are deemed more reliable.

总结:
本研究利用星系团透镜的时间延迟分布，估计了数十万至数百万个质量约10^6-10^8太阳质量的高红移（z > 4）宽线型AGN可能会被星系团进行多重成像。这些AGN可通过JWST在整个天空范围内进行检测，数百个可通过Euclid检测，数千个可通过罗马太空望远镜检测。这些结果可为早期宇宙中的BH质量标定提供重要参考。<br /><br /> <div>
Mass estimates of black holes (BHs) in the centers of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) often rely on the radius–luminosity relation. However, this relation, usually probed by reverberation mapping (RM), is poorly constrained in the high-luminosity and high-redshift ends due to the very long expected RM lag times. Multiply imaged AGNs may offer a unique opportunity to explore the radius–luminosity relation at these ends. In addition to comprising several magnified images enabling a more efficient light-curve sampling, the time delay between multiple images of strongly lensed quasars can also aid in making such RM measurements feasible on reasonable timescales: if the strong-lensing time delay is, for example, of the order of the expected RM time lag, changes in the emission lines in the leading image can be observed around the same time as the changes in the continuum in the trailing image. In this work we probe the typical time-delay distribution in galaxy-cluster lenses and estimate the number of both high-mass (∼109−1010M⊙) and high-redshift (z ≳ 4−12) quasars that are expected to be strongly lensed by clusters. We find that up to several tens of thousands of MBH ∼ 106–108M⊙ broad-line AGNs at z > 4 should be multiply imaged by galaxy clusters and detectable with JWST, hundreds with Euclid, and several thousand with the Roman Space Telescope, across the whole sky. These could supply an important calibration for the BH mass scaling in the early Universe.

IW And型现象在灾变变星中呈现出显著挑战，特别是在Karachurin 12的研究中发现了新的非食IW And型对象。研究表明Karachurin 12是一个倾斜盘的负超喷发系统，具有不同的周期模式，其中负超喷发振幅在周期内变化。这些发现为研究倾斜盘和IW And型现象提供了新的见解。现有的质量传输突发模型难以解释观测到的负超喷发振幅变化，而倾斜的热不稳定盘模型虽然指出了与IW And型现象可能的关联，但也难以解释Karachurin 12的详细变化。因此，需要考虑更广泛的因素来充分理解Karachurin 12的复杂变化。<br /><br />总结: IW And型现象在灾变变星中构成挑战，Karachurin 12被确认为新的非食IW And型物体，具有负超喷发，倾斜盘等特征。现有模型难以完全解释Karachurin 12的观测结果，需要考虑更广泛的因素。 <div>
The IW And-type phenomenon in cataclysmic variables presents a significant challenge to the accretion disk instability model. Using photometric data from the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, the Zwicky Transient Facility, and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, we identify Karachurin 12 as a new noneclipsing IW And-type object with a cycle period of 35.69(3) days. We also report for the first time that Karachurin 12 is a negative superhump (NSH) system featuring precessing tilted disks, with precession, orbital, and NSH periods of 4.9588(2) days, 0.3168895(13) days, and 0.2979861(8) days, respectively. Our analysis, using dips as the index and NSHs as the probe, reveals diverse cycle patterns in Karachurin 12, with NSH amplitude varying throughout the cycle. These findings offer new insights for studying tilted disks and the IW And-type phenomenon. The mass-transfer burst model has difficulty explaining the observed variations in NSH amplitude, especially given the uncertainty surrounding the origin of the mass-transfer burst. Meanwhile, the tilted thermally unstable disk model indicates a possible connection to the IW And-type phenomenon, but it also struggles to account for the detailed variations in Karachurin 12. Therefore, a wider range of factors must be considered to fully understand the complex changes in Karachurin 12.

Light echoes offer a means of studying protoplanetary disks, including their geometry and composition, even when they are not spatially resolved. We present a test of this approach applied specifically to optically thick, geometrically flared disks around active stars. Here we adopt stellar parameters of an active M dwarf to calculate light echoes for disks and rings with radii that would produce time delays consistent with TESS short cadence (about 2 minutes) time bins. Our results show successful fits to disk parameters, highlighting the potential effectiveness of this method in the search for protoplanetary disks.

总结: <br />本研究对银河系星团RCW 38的伽马射线发射进行了详细研究，并将其与其星际风特性和漫射X射线辐射进行了比较。我们发现了与星团重合的伽马射线发射，并计算了总伽马射线功率。根据估算的总风能量和CR加速效率，我们得出了星际风可能是银河系宇宙射线的重要来源的结论。此外，通过分析Chandra X射线数据，我们发现CR压力相对于星际风来说并不重要。这一发现表明了在RCW 38这样年轻的星团中，恒星风可能是银河系宇宙射线的重要来源。 <div>
Stellar winds from massive stars may be significant sources of cosmic rays (CRs). To investigate this connection, we report a detailed study of gamma-ray emission near the young Milky Way star cluster (≈0.5 Myr old) in the star-forming region RCW 38 and compare this emission to its stellar wind properties and diffuse X-ray emission. Using 15 yr of Fermi-LAT data in the 0.2–300 GeV band, we find a significant (σ > 22) detection coincident with the star cluster, producing a total gamma-ray luminosity (extrapolated over 0.1–500 GeV) of Lγ =(2.66 ± 0.92) × 1034 erg s−1 adopting a power-law spectral model (Γ = 2.34 ± 0.04). Using an empirical relationship and STARBURST99, we estimate the total wind power to be 8 × 1036 erg s−1, corresponding to a CR acceleration efficiency of ηCR ≃ 0.4 for an assumed diffusion coefficient consistent with D = 1028 cm2 s−1. Alternatively, a lower acceleration efficiency of 0.1 can produce this Lγ if the diffusion coefficient is smaller, D ≃ 2.5 × 1027 cm2 s−1. Additionally, we analyze Chandra X-ray data from the region and compare the hot-gas pressure to the CR pressure. We find the former is 4 orders of magnitude greater, suggesting that the CR pressure is not dynamically important relative to stellar winds. As RCW 38 is too young for supernovae to have occurred, the high CR acceleration efficiency in RCW 38 demonstrates that stellar winds may be an important source of Galactic CRs.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章报道了对星系PGC 3093694中超新星ASASSN-14il的长期光度和光谱研究。超新星在r波段达到峰值约-20.3±0.2等磁，表现出与SN 2006tf和SN 2010jl相媲美的水平。多波段和拟伪玻尔光度曲线显示了约50天的高原期。半解析CSM相互作用模型可以匹配光度曲线的高亮度和下降速率，但无法忠实地表示高原区域和光度曲线中的颠簸。光谱演变类似于Typelln SN，以CSM相互作用为主，显示出蓝色连续谱和窄的Balmer线。早期，线由电子散射主导。从约50天开始，可以在Hα谱线的宽部分中看到底层喷射物的特征，暗示CSM的不对称性。狭窄成分在整个演化过程中持续存在。与SN 2015da相比，ASASSN-14il表现出了显着的光度和光谱相似性。然而，ASASSN-14il与SN 2015da在偏振方面的不同表明了一种替代的观察角度。Hα谱线的后期蓝移支持了后冲击CSM或喷射物中尘埃的形成。2-7 M⊙ yr-1的质量损失率表明ASASSN-14il可能是一个处于喷发阶段的明亮蓝变星前体。 <div>
We present long-term photometric and spectroscopic studies of circumstellar material (CSM)–ejecta interacting supernova (SN) ASASSN-14il in the galaxy PGC 3093694. The SN reaches a peak r-band magnitude of ∼−20.3 ± 0.2 mag, rivaling SN 2006tf and SN 2010jl. The multiband and the pseudo-bolometric lightcurves show a plateau lasting ∼50 days. Semi-analytical CSM interaction models can match the high luminosity and decline rates of the lightcurves but fail to faithfully represent the plateau region and the bumps in the lightcurves. The spectral evolution resembles a typical Type IIn SN dominated by CSM interaction, showing blue continuum and narrow Balmer lines. The lines are dominated by electron scattering at early epochs. The signatures of the underlying ejecta are visible as the broad component in the Hα profile from as early as day 50, hinting at asymmetry in the CSM. A narrow component is persistent throughout the evolution. The SN shows remarkable photometric and spectroscopic similarity with SN 2015da. However, the different polarization in ASASSN-14il compared to SN 2015da suggests an alternative viewing angle. The late-time blueshift in the Hα profile supports dust formation in the post-shock CSM or ejecta. The mass-loss rate of 2–7 M⊙ yr−1 suggests a luminous blue variable progenitor in an eruptive phase for ASASSN-14il.

Dielectronic recombination (DR) rate coefficients for C-like Ca14+ were measured by Wen et al. at the electron cooler storage ring in Lanzhou, China. The measured DR rate coefficients from 0 to 92 eV cover most of the DR resonances associated with the 2s22p2 → 2s22p2 and 2s22p2 → 2s2p3 core transitions. In addition, Wen et al. reported theoretical results calculated with the Flexible Atomic Code (FAC) and AUTOSTRUCTURE (AS). However, these theoretical results show widespread and significant differences from the measured DR spectrum in both resonance energies and strengths, as well as between each other. In the present work, we uncover the reasons behind these large differences, both theoretical and experimental. The new FAC and AS results reproduce the observed spectrum in detail, especially at resonance energies below 8 eV, and they are in very close agreement with each other. The present plasma rate coefficients agree with the experimentally determined values to within 20% and 2% in the photoionized plasma (PP) and collisional ionized plasma (CP) temperature ranges, respectively. This is in contrast to the previous theoretical results, which showed differences with the experiment of up to ∼40% over the PP temperature range. The present FAC and AS results agree with each other within 5% in the PP and CP temperature ranges. Thus, the theoretical uncertainty is greatly reduced for the DR of Ca14+ and the present benchmarking with the experiment gives confidence to data users modeling non–local thermodynamic equilibrium plasma.

本研究利用SAGA调查中的SAGAbg-A样本对低质量SFS的低红移演化进行建模。我们针对23,258个星系的Hα基础SFR进行了研究，跨越z < 0.21 (t < 2.5 Gyr)。研究发现，在过去的约2.5亿年里，低质量SFS出现了显著的演化，归一化呈上升趋势。然而，将结果与宇宙学模拟进行比较发现，一些当代模拟低估了低质量SFS的最近演化。这表明最近低质量SFS的演化可以为低质量宇宙的组装提供新约束，并突出了在这一领域需要改进模型的必要性。 <div>
The redshift-dependent relation between galaxy stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR), known as the star-forming sequence (SFS), is a key observational yardstick for galaxy assembly. We use the SAGAbg-A sample of background galaxies from the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey to model the low-redshift evolution of the low-mass SFS. The sample is comprised of 23,258 galaxies with Hα-based SFRs spanning and z < 0.21 (t < 2.5 Gyr). Although it is common to bin or stack galaxies at z ≲ 0.2 for galaxy population studies, the difference in lookback time between z = 0 and z = 0.21 is comparable to the time between z = 1 and z = 2. We develop a model to account for both the physical evolution of low-mass SFS and the selection function of the SAGA Survey, allowing us to disentangle redshift evolution from redshift-dependent selection effects across the SAGAbg-A redshift range. Our findings indicate significant evolution in the SFS over the last ∼2.5 Gyr, with a rising normalization: . We also identify the redshift limit at which a static SFS is ruled out at the 95% confidence level, which is z = 0.05 based on the precision of the SAGAbg-A sample. Comparison with cosmological hydrodynamic simulations reveals that some contemporary simulations underpredict the recent evolution of the low-mass SFS. This demonstrates that the recent evolution of the low-mass SFS can provide new constraints on the assembly of the low-mass Universe and highlights the need for improved models in this regime.

No counterpart was detected at the magnetar’s position in and bands, providing stringent upper limits of and . Using archival X-ray data from NICER, we investigated the properties of the bursts and the spectral evolution of persistent emission.

The persistent flux evolution experienced a quick decay and an enhancement ∼27 days after the Burst Alert Telescope trigger. Using the NIR and X-ray emission, together with the Gran Telescopio Canarias optical/NIR upper limits, we discussed the origin of the NIR emission from the magnetar based on the fallback disk model and magnetosphere model. We found that either model cannot be ruled out with currently available data. Further mid-infrared observations are needed to find out the mechanism for producing the NIR emission from SGR J1935+2154.

Dragonfly Telephoto Array使用独特设计来探测传统望远镜可能会错过的非常庞大和分散的星系。Dragonfly Ultrawide Survey (DFUWS)是一项新的广域调查，将涵盖北半球天空的10,000平方度，并且提供了一个理想的数据集来发现这些大型分散星系。根据3100平方度的DFUWS数据，我们确定了11个大型低表面亮度星系作为光谱后续观测的样本。这些是在研究区域中最大的星系，看起来光滑且孤立，有效半径为12“–27”。其中有八个中心g波段表面亮度低于24。Keck Cosmic Web Imager显示，样本中的所有11个星系都是静止的，并且其中七个符合超漫散星系(UDGs)的标准。八个星系的距离在15至30Mpc之间，而另外三个位于50Mpc的彭斯星团中。它们的光谱显示出大约1亿年的星族以及更古老星族的证据。中间年龄组分存在于星系团和卫星星系中，但在彭斯星团的UDGs中却不存在。这个样本中的所有星系都在Dragonfly和Legacy成像中被检测到，并且该样本部分重叠现有的UDG目录。这个试点样本为我们对即将到来的全部10,000平方度DFUWS数据的分析提供了一个优秀的训练集，从中我们可能会发现甚至更大、以前未知的星系。
<br /><br />总结:Dragonfly Telephoto Array利用独特设计发现了11个大型分散星系的样本，这些星系表现出低表面亮度和静止状态。其中7个符合超漫散星系的标准，距离在15至50Mpc之间，而不同星系具有不同的光谱特征。这个样本为未来的DFUWS数据分析提供了良好的训练集合，并有望发现更大、先前未知的星系。 <div>
The Dragonfly Telephoto Array employs a unique design to detect very large and diffuse galaxies that might be missed with conventional telescopes. The Dragonfly Ultrawide Survey (DFUWS) is a new wide-field survey that will cover 10,000 deg2 of the northern sky, and it provides an ideal data set to find these large diffuse galaxies. From 3100 deg2 of DFUWS data, we identified 11 large, low surface brightness galaxies as a pilot sample for spectroscopic follow-up. These are the largest galaxies in the examined area that appear smooth and isolated, with effective radii of 12″–27″. Eight are below 24 in central g-band surface brightness. Keck Cosmic Web Imager spectra of the diffuse light show that all 11 galaxies in this sample are quiescent, and seven qualify as ultradiffuse galaxies (UDGs). Eight galaxies have distances between 15 and 30 Mpc, while the other three are in the Pegasus cluster at 50 Mpc. Their spectra show evidence of a ∼1 Gyr old stellar population in addition to an even older stellar population. The intermediate-age component is present in group and satellite galaxies but not in the Pegasus cluster UDGs. All galaxies in this sample are detected in both Dragonfly and Legacy imaging, and the sample partially overlaps with existing UDG catalogs. This pilot sample provides an excellent training set for our analysis of the upcoming full 10,000 deg2 DFUWS data, from which we may expect to discover even larger, previously unknown galaxies.

<div> 关键词: JWST, 低光度活跃星系核, X射线, 超马哈黑洞, 对应方案

总结:
这篇文章介绍了JWST观测到的高红移（z > 4）的低光度活跃星系核（LRDs），它们位于紧凑的红色宿主星系中，大多数在X射线中未被探测到。研究使用了对超马哈黑洞（SMBH）进行广义相对论辐射磁流体力学模拟，发现它们在X射线上具有固有的弱特性，且X射线辐射呈现出非常陡峭和软的光谱。文章指出，通过观测角度的变化，可以解释X射线的弱特性，而下一代望远镜如AXIS将能够从任何视角探测到这些X射线弱的LRDs。此外，文章提出了一种自洽的模型，解释了LRDs为何具有X射线弱的特性，并补充了其他模型的解释。文章还指出，LRDs宿主的SMBH可能是在轻微超马哈速率下缓慢自转的，并提出其质量被高估了约3倍。 <div>
JWST has revealed a population of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei at z > 4 in compact, red hosts (the “Little Red Dots,” or LRDs), which are largely undetected in X-rays. We investigate this phenomenon using General Relativistic Radiation Magnetohydrodynamics simulations of super-Eddington accretion onto a supermassive black hole (SMBH) with M• = 107M⊙ at z ∼ 6, representing the median population; the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) that we obtain are intrinsically X-ray weak. The highest levels of X-ray weakness occur in SMBHs accreting at mildly super-Eddington rates (1.4 < fEdd < 4) with zero spin, viewed at angles >30° from the pole. X-ray bolometric corrections in the observed 2–10 keV band reach ∼104 at z = 6, ∼5 times higher than the highest constraint from X-ray stacking. Most SEDs are extraordinarily steep and soft in the X-rays (median photon index Γ = 3.1, mode of Γ = 4.4). SEDs strong in the X-rays have harder spectra with a high-energy bump when viewed near the hot (>108 K) and highly relativistic jet, whereas X-ray weak SEDs lack this feature. Viewing an SMBH within 10° of its pole, where beaming enhances the X-ray emission, has a ∼1.5% probability, matching the LRD X-ray detection rate. Next-generation observatories like AXIS will detect X-ray-weak LRDs at z ∼ 6 from any viewing angle. Although many SMBHs in the LRDs are already estimated to accrete at super-Eddington rates, our model explains 50% of their population by requiring that their masses are overestimated by a mere factor of ∼3. In summary, we suggest that LRDs host slowly spinning SMBHs accreting at mildly super-Eddington rates, with large covering factors and broad emission lines enhanced by strong winds, providing a self-consistent explanation for their X-ray weakness and complementing other models.

总结: 
NGC 7314是一个Seyfert 1.9星系，通过X射线观察得到了详细的时序和光谱特性分析。时序分析显示不同能量波段存在显著的变异性，并且软光子和高能光子的变异性表现出不同的特点，暗示了它们可能来自不同的区域。光谱分析揭示了软能量突变、Fe Kα线辐射和显著的反射组分。RXTE/PCA数据分析显示了光子指数(Γ)和幂律通量的时间变化，暗示了NGC 7314的辐射特性在演化中。通过变化的Fe Kα发射线特征和吸收特征，NGC 7314可能是一个潜在的状态变化型活跃星系核。
<br /><br />总结: <div>
We present a comprehensive analysis of the timing and spectral properties of NGC 7314, a Seyfert 1.9 galaxy, using X-ray observations from XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and RXTE/proportional counter array (PCA). The timing analysis reveals significant variability across different energy bands, with fractional variability values consistent with previous studies. The highly variable soft photons and comparatively less variable high-energy photons imply different origins of these two types. The soft energy photons come from a hot corona near the center, while the high-energy photons are produced by inverse Compton scattering of these primary X-ray photons in a hot plasma away from the central region. The spectral analysis employs various models to characterize the emission components. The results indicate the presence of a soft energy bump, Fe Kα line emission, and a prominent reflection component. The long-term RXTE/PCA data analysis reveals temporal variations in the photon index (Γ) and power-law flux, suggesting evolving emission properties over time. The signature of both broad and narrow Fe Kα emission line features suggested the broad, variable one coming from the accretion disk (∼10−5 pc), while the nonevolving narrow line cannot be well constrained. The absorption feature could originate in a highly ionized region, possibly closer to the broad-line region. The evolution of the inner accretion properties indicates that NGC 7314 could be a potential changing-state active galactic nucleus.

<div> Fermi blazars, jet power, accretion rate, Blandford–Znajek mechanism, Blandford–Payne mechanism
<br />
通过研究937个Fermi blazar样本，探讨了射流形成机制，发现钝谷类射电星系BL Lacs的射流功率估算与质量吸积率之间没有相关性，而平谱射电类类星体FSRQs存在正向且较弱的相关性。同时，通过比较理论射流功率与SED拟合估算结果以及射电发射估算结果，发现大多数FSRQs的射流功率可以通过Blandford–Payne机制解释，而大多数BL Lacs的射流功率可以通过Blandford–Znajek机制解释。还发现FSRQs的质量吸积率比BL Lacs高，暗示它们周围的中心黑洞存在不同类型的质量吸积盘。 
<br /><br />总结: 
通过研究Fermi blazars，发现BL Lacs与FSRQs的射流功率估算与质量吸积率之间存在不同的相关性，同时探讨了Blandford–Znajek机制和Blandford–Payne机制对于不同类型blazars射流功率的解释能力。最后发现了两者质量吸积率的差异，暗示了它们周围黑洞存在不同类型的质量吸积盘。 <div>
The origin of jet launching mainly comes from two mechanisms: the Blandford–Znajek (BZ) mechanism and the Blandford–Payne (BP) mechanism. However, it is in debate which one is dominating in blazars. In this work, we used a sample of 937 Fermi blazars to study the jet formation mechanism. We studied the correlation between the jet power and the accretion rate, as well as the comparison between jet power estimated by spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting and that estimated by theoretical formula and radio flux density. Our results suggest that there is no correlation between jet power estimated by SED fitting and the accretion rate for BL Lacertaes (BL Lacs), while a positive and weak correlation exists for flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). Meanwhile, to confirm whether the BP and BZ mechanism is sufficient to launch the jet for FSRQs and BL Lacs, we compare the theoretical jet power with that estimated by SED fitting, as well as that by radio emission. We found that the jet power for most of the two subclasses estimated by SED fitting cannot be explained by either the BP or BZ mechanism. While the jet power for most FSRQs estimated by radio flux density can be explained by the BP mechanism, and most BL Lacs can be explained by the BZ mechanism. We also found that FSRQs have higher accretion rates than BL Lacs, implying different accretion disks around their central black holes: FSRQs typically have standard disks, while BL Lacs usually have advection-dominated accretion flow disks.

<div> ULPPs, pulsars, magnetars, fallback disks, instability
总结: 
最近发现了几颗脉冲星的周期异常长，这可能构成了超长周期脉冲星（ULPPs）的潜在种群。它们的长周期起源尚不明确，但可能与被周围残留物盘减速的磁星有关。尽管对于磁星和残留物盘辅助演化的系统研究并不多，但盘中的不稳定性却鲜有人关注，而这决定了盘的寿命。在这项工作中，我们模拟了具有超新星残留物盘的磁场、自转周期和磁倾角的演化。我们发现盘中的热粘滞不稳定可能会显著影响ULPPs的形成。我们的模拟结果还显示，大部分ULPPs似乎是几乎对齐和正交的旋转体。这可能有助于将ULPPs放置在脉冲周期-周期导数平面的死亡线之上。然而，一些额外的机制似乎是必要的来解释ULPPs的射电发射。 <div>
Several pulsars with unusually long periods were discovered recently, comprising a potential population of ultralong period pulsars (ULPPs). The origin of their long periodicity is not well understood, but may be related to magnetars spun down by surrounding fallback disks. While there are few systematic investigations on the fallback-disk-assisted evolution of magnetars, instability in the disk has received little attention, which determines the lifetime of the disk. In this work we simulate the evolution of the magnetic field, spin period, and magnetic inclination angle of magnetars with a supernova fallback disk. We find that a thermal viscous instability in the disk could significantly affect the formation of ULPPs. Our simulation results also reveal that a large fraction of ULPPs seem to be nearly aligned and orthogonal rotators. This might help place ULPPs above the death line in the pulse period–period derivative plane. However, some extra mechanisms seem to be required to account for the radio emission of ULPPs.

This work aims to spectroscopically characterize and provide for the first time direct experimental frequencies of the ground vibrational state and two excited states of the simplest alkynyl thiocyanate (HCCSCN) for astrophysical use. Both microwave (8–16 GHz) and millimeter-wave regions (50–120 GHz) of the spectrum have been measured and analyzed in terms of Watson’s semirigid rotor Hamiltonian. A total of 314 transitions were assigned to the ground state of HCCSCN, and a first set of spectroscopic constants have been accurately determined. Spectral features of the molecule were then searched for in Sgr B2(N), NGC 6334I, G+0.693−0.027, and TMC-1 molecular clouds. Upper limits to the column density are provided.

<div> 简化模型，研究了在自引力系统中圆形运动脉动体的运动。关键词：自引力系统，圆形运动，脉动体，等离子体，动力摩擦。<br /><br />总结:本研究侧重于研究在自引力系统中圆形运动的脉动体的运动。研究发现在等离子体中，对于亚音速运动，动力摩擦力矩被抑制；而对于超音速运动，期望值与无限的均匀介质期望值一致，并与重力扭矩的局部近似相一致。此外，在固定分辨率的情况下，系统的响应在马赫数接近奇异等温轮廓的恒定圆速度附近是最大的，这最大化了尾迹声波激发的引力波产生。在包含许多现实情况的简化描述中，这种引力波信号可能与质量为106M⊙的大质量黑洞周围的螺旋下降相当，当小黑洞进入大质量黑洞的邦迪球时，此引力波信号可能在次纳赫兹频率达到与黑洞二进制的真空引力波发射相媲美的水平。 <div>
We consider the motion of a circularly moving perturber in a self-gravitating, collisional system with a spherically symmetric density profile. We concentrate on the singular isothermal sphere, which, despite its pathological features, admits a simple polarization function in linear response theory. This allows us to solve for the acoustic wake trailing the perturber and the resulting dynamical friction, in the limit where the self-gravity of the response can be ignored. In a steady state and for subsonic velocities vp < cs, the dynamical friction torque is suppressed for perturbers orbiting in an isothermal sphere relative to the infinite, homogeneous medium expectation Fφ ∝ vp. For highly supersonic motions, both expectations agree and are consistent with a local approximation to the gravitational torque. At fixed resolution (a given Coulomb logarithm), the response of the system is maximal for Mach numbers near the constant circular velocity of the singular isothermal profile. This resonance maximizes the gravitational-wave (GW) emission produced by the trailing acoustic wake. For an inspiral around a massive black hole of mass 106M⊙ located at the center of a (truncated) isothermal sphere, this GW signal could be comparable to the vacuum GW emission of a black hole binary at subnanohertz frequencies when the small black hole enters the Bondi sphere of the massive one. The exact magnitude of this effect depends on departures from hydrostatic equilibrium and on the viscosity present in any realistic astrophysical fluid, which are not included in our simplified description.

Age is the most difficult fundamental stellar parameter to infer for isolated stars. While isochrone-based ages are in general imprecise for both main-sequence dwarfs and red giants, precise isochrone-based ages can be obtained for stars on the subgiant branch transitioning from core to shell hydrogen burning. We synthesize Gaia Data Release 3–based distance inferences, multiwavelength photometry from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared, and three-dimensional extinction maps to construct a sample of 289,759 solar-metallicity stars amenable to accurate, precise, and physically self-consistent age inferences. Using subgiants in the solar-metallicity open clusters NGC 2682 (i.e., M67) and NGC 188, we show that our approach yields accurate and physically self-consistent ages and metallicities with median statistical precisions of 8% and 0.06 dex, respectively. The inclusion of systematic uncertainties resulting from nonsingle or variable stars results in age and metallicity precisions of 9% and 0.12 dex, respectively. We supplement this solar-metallicity sample with an additional 112,062 metal-poor subgiants, including over 3000 stars with [Fe/H] ≲ −1.50, 7% age precisions, and apparent Gaia G-band magnitudes G < 14. We further demonstrate that our inferred metallicities agree with those produced by multiplexed spectroscopic surveys. As an example of the scientific potential of this catalog, we show that the solar neighborhood star formation history has three components at ([Fe/H], τ/Gyr) ≈ (+0.0, 4), (+0.2, 7), and a roughly linear sequence in age–metallicity space beginning at ([Fe/H], τ/Gyr) ≈ (+0.2, 7) and extending to (−0.5, 13). Our analyses indicate that the solar neighborhood includes stars on disk-like orbits even at the oldest ages and lowest metallicities accessible by our samples.

总结:<br /><br />本研究使用James Webb Space Telescope的NIRSpec和MIRI仪器对20个T和Y矮星进行了全面分析。通过两种大气模型 Sonora Elf Owl 和 ATMO2020 ++，确定了有效温度和金属丰度，但在表面重力方面存在显著差异。通过文献中的绝对视差和拟合的有效温度，确定了这些棕矮星的半径、质量和年龄。结果显示，大多数棕矮星质量低于30MJup，年龄不超过6亿年。对NIRSpec和MIRI光谱进行比较表明，仅使用NIRSpec光谱获得的有效温度和表面重力与合并光谱获得的结果基本一致。 <div>
We present a comprehensive analysis of 20 T and Y dwarfs using spectroscopy from the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) CLEAR/PRISM and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) low-resolution spectrometer instruments on the James Webb Space Telescope. To characterize the atmospheric parameters, we utilize two atmospheric model grids: the Sonora Elf Owl and ATMO2020++. The effective temperatures derived from the two models are relatively consistent, and metallicities are both close to solar values. However, significant discrepancies are found in other parameters, particularly in surface gravity, with the values obtained from the Sonora Elf Owl models typically being about 1 dex lower than those from the ATMO2020++ models. Further comparisons using the ATMO2020 models highlight that the adiabatic convective process introduced in the ATMO2020++ models has a significant impact on the determination of surface gravity. Using the fitted effective temperatures and absolute parallaxes from the literature, we derive radii for the brown dwarfs, which range from approximately 0.8–1.2 RJup. The estimated masses and ages, derived using evolutionary tracks, indicate that most brown dwarfs in our sample have masses below 30 MJup and are younger than 6 Gyr. Specifically, Y dwarfs have masses ranging from 2 to 20 MJup and ages between 0.1 and 6.7 Gyr. In addition, we discuss the determination of atmospheric parameters using only NIRSpec or MIRI spectra. Comparisons with results from the combined spectra show that the effective temperatures and surface gravities derived solely from NIRSpec spectra are largely consistent with those obtained from the combined spectra.

<div> Rossby wave instability, radial shear instability, disks, disk accretion, planetary gaps

总结:
Rossby wave instability (RWI)是盘状结构中的基本非轴对称径向剪切不稳定性，可以促进盘的吸积，确定行星间隙的形状，并产生大型涡旋。该现象源于密度和/或温度特征，例如径向间隙、凸起或阶梯。触发RWI的一般充分条件尚不清楚，但通过研究一系列简化模型（包括不可压缩和可压缩剪切层以及全局圆柱形盘），可以揭示这一情况。研究重点是处理不同形状的盘特征的焓幅和宽度。研究发现，跨越广泛参数空间的RWI边界和增长率的解析结果为一些情况提供了确切推导，而在其他情况下则为数值结果的描述。总体而言，宽度大于一个尺度高度的特征通常在到达雷利不稳定性的一半时变得不稳定，具体来说，当平方的星周频率约为开普勒值的一半时。RWI的增长速率大致按照焓幅的1/3次幂进行缩放，对宽度的依赖性较弱。全局盘曲率会影响宽行星间隙，使外间隙边缘更容易受到RWI的影响。我们的简化模型是等熵的且在垂直方向上积分，但主要结果应该能够推广到更复杂和更现实的情景。 <div>
The Rossby wave instability (RWI) is the fundamental nonaxisymmetric radial shear instability in disks. The RWI can facilitate disk accretion, set the shape of planetary gaps, and produce large vortices. It arises from density and/or temperature features, such as radial gaps, bumps, or steps. A general, sufficient condition to trigger the RWI is lacking, which we address by studying the linear RWI in a suite of simplified models, including incompressible and compressible shearing sheets and global, cylindrical disks. We focus on enthalpy amplitude and width as the fundamental properties of disk features with various shapes. We find analytic results for the RWI boundary and growth rates across a wide parameter space, in some cases with exact derivations and in others as a description of numerical results. Features wider than a scale height generally become unstable about halfway to Rayleigh instability, i.e., when the squared epicyclic frequency is about half the Keplerian value, reinforcing our previous finding. RWI growth rates approximately scale as enthalpy amplitude to the 1/3 power, with a weak dependence on width, across much of the parameter space. Global disk curvature affects wide planetary gaps, making the outer gap edge more susceptible to the RWI. Our simplified models are barotropic and height integrated, but the main results should carry over to more complex and realistic scenarios.

Technological progress related to astronomical observatories such as the recently launched James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allows searching for signs of life beyond our solar system, namely, in the form of unambiguous biosignature gases in exoplanetary atmospheres. The tentative assignment of a 1σ–2.4σ spectral feature observed with JWST in the atmosphere of exoplanet K2-18b to the biosignature gas dimethyl sulfide (DMS; sum formula C2H6S) raised hopes that, although controversial, a second genesis had been found. Terrestrial atmospheric DMS is exclusively stemming from marine biological activity, and no natural abiotic source has been identified—neither on Earth nor in space. Therefore, DMS is considered a robust biosignature. Since comets possess a pristine inventory of complex organic molecules of abiotic origin, we have searched high-resolution mass spectra collected at comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, target of the European Space Agency’s Rosetta mission, for the signatures of DMS. Previous work reported the presence of a C2H6S signal when the comet was near its equinox, but distinction of DMS from its structural isomer ethanethiol remained elusive. Here we reassess these and evaluate additional data. Based on differences in the electron ionization-induced fragmentation pattern of the two isomers, we show that DMS is significantly better compatible with the observations. Deviations between expected and observed signal intensities for DMS are <1σ, while for ethanethiol they are 2σ–4σ. The local abundance of DMS relative to methanol deduced from these data is (0.13 ± 0.04)%. Our results provide the first evidence for the existence of an abiotic synthetic pathway to DMS in pristine cometary matter and hence motivate more detailed studies of the sulfur chemistry in such matter and its analogs. Future studies need to investigate whether or not the present inference of cometary DMS could provide an abiotic source of DMS in a planetary atmosphere.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了来自GASP调查的五个星系中，受到了风压剥夺气体的后期阶段，对SFR的影响。研究结果显示，在受密集气体主导的区域，UV和Hα示踪物显示类似的SFR值，而在受弥散电离气体主导的区域，SFR(UV)高出0.5 dex。另外，研究还发现了在Hα有发射而UV没有的区域，这些区域显示出类似LINER的发射特征，表明它们的电离过程不是由于恒星形成。最终的结论是，导致SFR测量差异的主要原因是最近在受到DIG主导的区域中星形成历史的变化。 <div>
Star formation rates (SFRs) in galaxies offer a view of various physical processes across them, and are measured using various tracers, such as Hα and ultraviolet (UV). Different physical mechanisms can affect Hα and UV emission, resulting in a discrepancy in the corresponding SFR estimates (ΔSFR). We investigate the effects of ram pressure on the SFR measurements and ΔSFR across five galaxies from the GASP survey caught in the late stages of gas stripping due to ram pressure. We probe spatially resolved ΔSFR at pixel scales of 0.5 kpc, and compare disks to tails and regions dominated by the dense gas to diffuse ionized gas (DIG) regions. The regions dominated by dense gas show similar SFR values for UV and Hα tracers, while the regions dominated by the DIG show up to 0.5 dex higher SFR(UV). There is a large galaxy-by-galaxy variation in ΔSFR, with no difference between the disks and the tails. We discuss the potential causes of variations in ΔSFR between the dense gas and DIG areas. We conclude that the dominant cause of discrepancy are recent variations in star formation histories, where star formation recently dropped in the DIG-dominated regions leading to changes in ΔSFR. The areal coverage of the tracers shows areas with Hα and no UV emission; these areas have LINER-like emission (excess in [O iλ6300]/Hα line ratio), indicating that they are ionized by processes other than star formation.

The gas-phase velocity dispersions in disk galaxies, which trace turbulence in the interstellar medium, are observed to increase with lookback time. However, the mechanisms that set this rise in turbulence are observationally poorly constrained. To address this, we combine kiloparsec-scale Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of CO(3−2) and CO(4−3) with Hubble Space Telescope observations of Hα to characterize the molecular gas and star formation properties of seven local analogs of main-sequence galaxies at z ∼ 1–2, drawn from the DYNAMO sample. Investigating the “molecular gas main sequence” on kiloparsec scales, we find that galaxies in our sample are more gas-rich than local star-forming galaxies at all disk positions. We measure beam-smearing-corrected molecular gas velocity dispersions and relate them to the molecular gas and star formation rate surface densities. Despite being relatively nearby (z ∼ 0.1), DYNAMO galaxies exhibit high velocity dispersions and gas and star formation rate surface densities throughout their disks, when compared to local star-forming samples. Comparing these measurements to predictions from star formation theory, we find very good agreements with the latest feedback-regulated star formation models. However, we find that theories that combine dissipation of gravitational energy from radial gas transport with feedback overestimate the observed molecular gas velocity dispersions.

总结: 
本文描述了“Medium Bands, Mega Science” JWST Cycle 2调查（JWST-GO-4111），展示了这些数据揭示了从当地宇宙到宇宙黎明时代的星系的空间集成和空间分辨特性。MegaScience获得了大约30平方弧秒的深度多波段NIRCam成像，其中包括11个中波段滤光片和两个最短波长的宽带滤光片，F070W和F090W。此外，MegaScience还包括了大约17平方弧秒的NIRISS平行成像。我们公开发布了NIRCam主要和NIRISS并行领域的完全降低的数据和光度目录。我们的研究显示，MegaScience通过光度红移的分散度和灾难性离群值率改善了2-3倍。此外，我们通过展示三个光谱确认的z>6星系的 [O iii]线发射和连续发射的地图，展示了MegaScience所带来的空间解析科学的价值。这些研究结果证明了就连在早期时代，星系的结构和形成历史也是复杂的。 <div>
In this paper, we describe the “Medium Bands, Mega Science” JWST Cycle 2 survey (JWST-GO-4111) and demonstrate the power of these data to reveal both the spatially integrated and spatially resolved properties of galaxies from the local Universe to the era of cosmic dawn. Executed in 2023 November, MegaScience obtained ∼30 arcmin2 of deep multiband NIRCam imaging centered on the z ∼ 0.3 A2744 cluster, including 11 medium-band filters and the two shortest-wavelength broadband filters, F070W and F090W. Together, MegaScience and the UNCOVER Cycle 1 treasury program provide a complete set of deep (∼28–30 magAB) images in all NIRCam medium- and broadband filters. This unique data set allows us to precisely constrain photometric redshifts, map stellar populations and dust attenuation for large samples of distant galaxies, and examine the connection between galaxy structures and formation histories. MegaScience also includes ∼17 arcmin2 of NIRISS parallel imaging in two broadband and four medium-band filters from 0.9 to 4.8 μm, expanding the footprint where robust spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting is possible. We provide example SEDs and multiband cutouts at a variety of redshifts, and use a catalog of JWST spectroscopic redshifts to show that MegaScience improves both the scatter and catastrophic outlier rate of photometric redshifts by factors of 2–3. Additionally, we demonstrate the spatially resolved science enabled by MegaScience by presenting maps of the [O iii] line emission and continuum emission in three spectroscopically confirmed z > 6 galaxies. We show that line emission in reionization-era galaxies can be clumpy, extended, and spatially offset from continuum emission, implying that galaxy assembly histories are complex even at these early epochs. We publicly release fully reduced mosaics and photometric catalogs for both the NIRCam primary and NIRISS parallel fields (jwst-uncover.github.io/megascience).

We have used high-resolution zoom-in simulations of direct collapse to supermassive black hole (SMBH) seeds within dark mater halos in the presence of magnetic fields generated during the collapse, down to 10−5 pc or 2 au. We confirm an efficient amplification of magnetic field during collapse, the formation of a geometrically thick self-gravitating accretion disk inside 0.1 pc, and damping of fragmentation in the disk by the field. This disk differs profoundly from SMBH accretion disks. We find the following: (1) The accretion disk is subject to the magnetorotational instability, which further amplifies the field to near equipartition. No artificial seeding of the disk field has been used. (2) The equipartition toroidal field changes its polarity in the midplane. (3) The nonlinear Parker instability develops, accompanied by the vertical buckling of the field lines, which injects material above the disk, leading to an increase in the disk scale height. (4) With the Coriolis force producing a coherent helicity above the disk, the vertical poloidal field has been generated and amplified. (5) We estimate that the associated outflow will be most probably squashed by accretion. The resulting configuration consists of a magnetized disk with β ≳ 0.1 and its magnetosphere with β ≪ 1, where β = Pth/PB is the ratio of thermal to magnetic energy density. (6) The disk is highly variable, due to feeding by variable accretion flow, and strong vortical motions are present. (7) Finally, the negative gradient of the total vertical stress drives an equatorial outflow sandwiched by an inward accretion flow.

Understanding when and how reionization happened is crucial for studying the early structure formation and the properties of the first galaxies in the Universe. At z > 5.5, the observed intergalactic medium (IGM) optical depth shows a significant scatter, indicating an inhomogeneous reionization process. However, the nature of the inhomogeneous reionization remains debated. A SPectroscopic survey of biased halos In the Reionization Era (ASPIRE) is a JWST Cycle 1 program that has spectroscopically identified >400 [O iii] emitters in 25 quasar fields at z > 6.5. Combined with deep ground-based optical spectroscopy of ASPIRE quasars, the ASPIRE program provides the current largest sample for IGM-galaxy connection studies during cosmic reionization. We present the first results of IGM effective optical depth measurements around [O iii] emitters using 14 ASPIRE quasar fields. We find the IGM transmission is tightly related to reionization era galaxies to the extent that a significant excess of Lyα transmission exists around [O iii] emitters. We measure the stacked IGM effective optical depth of IGM patches associated with [O iii] emitters and find they reach the same IGM effective optical depth at least dz ∼ 0.1 ahead of those IGM patches where no [O iii] emitters are detected, supporting earlier reionization around [O iii] emitters. Our results indicate an enhancement in IGM Lyα transmission around [O iii] emitters at scales beyond 25 h−1 cMpc, consistent with the predicted topology of reionization from fluctuating UV background models.

The binary-driven hypernova (BdHN) model proposes long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate in binaries composed of a carbon–oxygen (CO) star and a neutron star (NS) companion. The CO core collapse generates a newborn NS and a supernova that triggers the GRB by accreting onto the NSs, rapidly transferring mass and angular momentum to them. This article aims to determine the conditions under which a black hole (BH) forms from NS collapse induced by the accretion and the impact on the GRB’s observational properties and taxonomy. We perform three-dimensional, smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of BdHNe using up-to-date NS nuclear equations of state, with and without hyperons, and calculate the structure evolution in full general relativity. We assess the binary parameters leading either NS in the binary to the critical mass for gravitational collapse into a BH and its occurrence time, tcol. We include a nonzero angular momentum of the NSs and find that tcol ranges from a few tens of seconds to hours for decreasing NS initial angular momentum values. BdHNe I are the most compact (about 5 minute orbital period), promptly form a BH, and release ≳1052 erg of energy. They form NS–BH binaries with tens of kiloyears merger timescales by gravitational-wave emission. BdHNe II and III do not form BHs, and release ∼1050–1052 erg and ≲1050 erg of energy, respectively. They form NS–NS binaries with a range of merger timescales larger than for NS–BH binaries. In some compact BdHNe II, either NS can become supramassive, i.e., above the critical mass of a nonrotating NS. Magnetic braking by a 1013 G field can delay BH formation, leading to BH–BH or NS–BH with tens of kiloyears merger timescales.

总结:
射电星系根据形态学可分为两大类：FR-I和FR-II。研究表明，射流动力学结构受到能量注入通量和射流与背景密度对比的影响。通过相对论流体力学模拟，发现了低能量相对论射流在亚千秒差距和千秒差距尺度上的流动结构。模拟结果显示，射流主脊的速度和背景密度梯度对射流诱导流的动力学和结构起主导作用。使用简单的磁场分布和非热电子模型以及相对论束缚效应，制作了模拟射流的合成同步辐射亮度地图，结果与观测相一致。对比了不同背景效应，认为压力约束的丧失可能是FR-I射流不稳定和破裂的关键因素。研究结果证实，温和相对论射流能够解释射电星系的单侧或不对称特征。 <div>
Radio galaxies are classified into two primary categories based on their morphology: center-brightened FR-I and edge-brightened FR-II. It is believed that the jet power and interactions with the ambient medium govern the deceleration and decollimation of the jet-spine flows, which, in turn, influence this dichotomy. Using high-resolution, three-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic simulations, we follow the development of flow structures on sub-kiloparsec to kiloparsec scales in kinetically dominant low-power relativistic jets. We find that the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet spine and the advance speed of the jet head, which depend on the energy injection flux and the jet-to-background density contrast, primarily determine the dynamics and structures of the jet-induced flows. The entrainment of ambient gas and the background density and pressure gradient may also play significant roles. To emulate radio morphology, we produce the synthetic maps of the synchrotron surface brightness for the simulated jets, by employing simple models for magnetic field distribution and nonthermal electron population and considering relativistic beaming effects at different inclination angles. Both the flow structures and radio maps capture the longitudinal and transverse structures of the jet-spine and shear layer, consistent with observations. We also compare different background effects and argue that the loss of pressure confinement beyond the galactic core may be a key factor in the flaring and disruption of FR-I jets. Our results confirm that mildly relativistic jets could explain the one-sidedness or asymmetries with the boosted main jet and deboosted counterjet pairs.

总结: 
本研究探讨了恒星外壳的声学扰动如何通过非线性波陡增导致弱激波的形成。我们使用了平行欧拉方程在等熵流动情况下有精确黎曼不变量的事实，得出了声学扰动的精确解，并展示了在波峰形成激波之后，可以使用惠特姆逼近来解决激波的动力学问题，使用简单的常微分方程。数值模拟表明我们的解析激波近似在中等马赫数范围内是准确的，其中准确性随绝热指数增加而增加。 <div>
Acoustic perturbations to stellar envelopes can lead to the formation of weak shock waves via nonlinear wave steepening. Close to the stellar surface, the weak shock wave increases in strength and can potentially lead to the expulsion of part of the stellar envelope. While accurate analytic solutions to the fluid equations exist in the limits of low-amplitude waves or strong shocks, connecting these phases generally requires simulations. We address this problem using the fact that the plane-parallel Euler equations, in the presence of a constant gravitational field, admit exact Riemann invariants when the flow is isentropic. We obtain exact solutions for acoustic perturbations and show that after they steepen into shock waves, Whitham’s approximation can be used to solve for the shock’s dynamics in the weak to moderately strong regimes, using a simple ordinary differential equation. Numerical simulations show that our analytic shock approximation is accurate up to moderate (∼few–15) Mach numbers, where the accuracy increases with the adiabatic index.

总结:
该研究利用射电太阳望远镜网络在1989年1月1日至2019年12月17日期间记录的太阳无线电流量数据，通过集合经验模态分解（EEMD）和小波分析的方法，研究了太阳冠层的径向差分旋转的时间演变。结果显示，在30年的观测期间内，在245-8800 MHz的频率范围内，太阳无线电流量的旋转率随频率增加而增加，验证了太阳冠层在近三个太阳周期的长时间尺度上存在径向差分旋转。同时，根据射电发射机制，这些结果在一定程度上可以作为太阳上层大气旋转随高度变化的指标。此外，通过无线电流量旋转周期长度的时间变化，研究发现从低冠层到大约1.3个太阳半径高度范围内，太阳冠层旋转随着太阳活动周期的进展表现出复杂的时间变化，但在过去30年里，冠层旋转速度随着高度增加而逐渐变慢。最后，EEMD方法可以从这些高度随机的无线电发射中提取旋转周期信号，因此可以用来研究更高或更低频率的无线电发射的旋转周期。 <br /><br /> <div>
The daily measurements of the disk-integrated solar radio flux, observed by the Radio Solar Telescope Network, at 245, 410, 610, 1415, 2695, 4995, and 8800 MHz during the time interval of 1989 January 1 to 2019 December 17, are used to investigate the temporal evolution of radial differential rotation of the solar corona using the methods of ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and wavelet analysis. Overall, the results reveal that over the 30 yr period, the rotation rates for the observed solar radio flux within the frequency range of 245–8800 MHz show an increase with frequency. This verifies the existence of the radial differential rotation of the solar corona over long timescales of nearly three solar cycles. Based on the radio emission mechanism, to some extent, the results can also serve as an indicator of how the rotation of the solar upper atmosphere varies with altitude within a specific range. From the temporal variation of rotation cycle lengths of radio flux, the coronal rotation at different altitudes from the low corona to approximately 1.3 R⊙ exhibits complex temporal variations with the progression of the solar cycle. However, in this altitude range, over the past 30 yr from 1989 to 2019, the coronal rotation consistently becomes gradually slower as the altitude increases. Finally, the EEMD method can extract rotation cycle signals from these highly randomized radio emissions, and so it can be used to investigate the rotation periods for the radio emissions at higher or lower frequencies.

Ultralow-frequency (ULF) waves在木星系统中普遍存在，与磁层和电离层中的能量耗散有关。尽管磁层内部存在与行星自转相关的磁盘振荡，但通过Juno探测器在磁层界面层的长时间（>4小时）原位测量，可以直接评估内部等离子体和外部太阳风相互作用导致的界面动态的几十分钟周期性。通过磁场和粒子数据的周期图分析，发现了约18分钟、约40分钟和约70-80分钟的ULF波，这与远程遥感观测中的脉动一致。同时还发现了多谐波ULF现象。原位测量得到的周期性提供了解木星系统中脉动波动/极光发射起源的重要线索。这些结果还有助于进一步了解木星内部等离子体与外部太阳风之间的能量传输和释放。 <br /><br />总结: Ultralow-frequency waves在木星系统中广泛存在，Juno探测器的原位测量揭示了多种周期性，这些发现有助于我们更好地理解木星系统中的能量转移和释放过程。 <div>
Ultralow-frequency (ULF) waves (∼tens of minutes period) are widely identified in the Jovian system and are believed to be associated with energy dissipation in the magnetosphere and ionosphere. Due to the magnetodisk oscillation related to planetary rotation, it is challenging to identify the periodicities inside the magnetosphere, although remote sensing observations of the polar emissions provide clear evidence of the tens of minutes pulsations. In this study, we take advantage of Juno’s in situ measurements in the magnetopause boundary layer for a long duration, i.e., >4 hr, to directly assess the tens of minutes periodicities of the boundary dynamics caused by the interactions between the internal plasma and external solar wind. Through periodogram analysis on the magnetic field and particle data, we find ULF waves with periodicities of ∼18 minutes, ∼40 minutes, and ∼70–80 minutes, which is generally consistent with pulsations in multiple remote sensing observations. A multiple-harmonic ULF phenomenon was also identified in the observations. The periodicities from in situ measurements provide crucial clues in understanding the origin of pulsating wave/auroral emissions in the Jovian system. The results could also further our understanding of energy transfer and release between the internal plasma of Jupiter and external solar wind.

总结:<br /><br />这项研究利用Juno任务在太阳系外巡航阶段的磁场数据，对1-5.5天文单位距离范围内的338个小磁通量绳进行了可视化识别和分析。研究发现这些事件在日心距离上均匀分布，没有明显的趋势。平均来看，小磁通量绳的磁场轮廓对称，并且在观测的日心距离上变化不大。此外，研究还观察到小磁通量绳的持续时间平均呈轻微增加趋势，表明在传播过程中扩展很小。研究确定小磁通量绳的平均磁场与距离的关系最适合用两个分别的幂律来描述，从1到大约2.1天文单位距离有较陡的衰减，而从大约2.1到5.5天文单位距离的衰减较为缓和。研究还发现，在近1天文单位距离，小磁通量绳平均磁场的统计衰减速率略高于恒星际磁场，这表明小磁通量绳可能随时间变得难以与恒星际磁场区分开。在总体小磁通量绳中，仅有约26%出现在距离太阳风带电流片区1天的范围内，这表明大多数小磁通量绳的出现与太阳风带电流片区的关联性非常有限。这些结果对于太阳系外探测到的小磁通量绳的起源提出了问题，鼓励寻找传统发生机制之外的替代方案。 <div>
In this study, we utilize magnetic field data from the Juno mission’s cruise phase to visually identify and analyze 338 interplanetary small flux ropes (SFRs) across a heliocentric distance range of 1–5.5 au. The events are uniformly distributed across heliocentric distances, showing no clear trend. Through superposed epoch analysis, we find that the average SFR magnetic field profiles are symmetric and show little variation across the observed heliocentric distances. Additionally, we observe a slight increasing trend in the mean duration of SFRs, indicating minimal expansion during propagation. Furthermore, we determine that the SFR mean magnetic field dependence on distance is best fit by two separate power laws, exhibiting a steeper decay from 1 to ∼2.1 au and a shallower decay from ∼2.1 to 5.5 au. Near 1 au, the statistical decay rate of the mean magnetic field magnitude of SFRs is slightly higher than that of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), suggesting that SFRs may become indistinguishable from the IMF over time. This finding implies that SFRs detected at greater radial distances are possibly generated in situ as opposed to near the Sun. However, only ∼26% of the total population of SFRs in our catalog occurs within 1 day from the heliospheric current sheet (HCS), indicating a very limited association between the occurrence of the majority of SFRs and the presence of the HCS. These results raise questions about the origin of SFRs detected at larger distances, encouraging further exploration for alternatives to the conventional generation mechanisms.

Galaxy clustering contains information on cosmology, galaxy evolution, and the relationship between galaxies and their dark matter hosts. On small scales, the detailed kinematics of galaxies within their host halos determines the galaxy clustering. In this paper, we investigate the dependence of the central and satellite galaxy kinematics on θ, the intrinsic host halo properties (mass, spin, concentration), cosmology (Ωm, σ8), and baryonic feedback from active galactic nuclei and supernovae (AAGN1, AAGN2, ASN1, ASN2). We utilize 2000 hydrodynamic simulations in CAMELS run using IllustrisTNG and SIMBA galaxy formation models. Focusing on central and satellite galaxies with M* > 109M⊙, we apply neural density estimation (NDE) with normalizing flows to estimate their p(Δr ∣ θ) and p(Δv ∣ θ), where Δr and Δv are the magnitudes of the halocentric spatial and velocity offsets. With NDE, we accurately capture the dependence of galaxy kinematics on each component of θ. For central galaxies, we identify significant spatial and velocity biases dependent on halo mass, concentration, and spin. For satellite distributions, we find significant deviations from a Navarro–Frenk–White profile and evidence that they consist of distinct orbiting and infalling populations. However, we find no strong dependence on θ besides a weak dependence on host halo spin. For both central and satellite galaxies, there is no notable dependence on cosmological parameters and baryonic feedback. These results provide key insights for improving the current halo occupation distribution (HOD) models. This work is the first in a series that will reexamine and develop HOD frameworks for improved modeling of galaxy clustering at smaller scales.

这篇论文描述了一种新的方法，从同时观测多个极地斑的数据中，统计确定高纬度太阳自转速率的方法。作者提取了之前在1997年2月至1998年2月期间获取的在6767Å连续波段的平坦场图像制作的电影中的帧，并用这些帧构建了有利的朝向南极帽高纬度切片的时空图。这些图显示了一系列倾斜的轨迹，其平均斜率表示该纬度的斑点的东西速度。当斜率被测量并作为纬度的函数绘制时，它们显示出相对较小的散射，约为0.01-0.02 km s-1，从一个直线的零速度延伸通过太阳的南极。这意味着速度v(λs)和纬度半径r(λs)以相同的速率趋近于0，因此它们的比率给出了一个几乎恒定的绕太阳南极的日辉自转速率约为8.6°/天。在一些不利的朝向北极帽的测量与南极附近的这些测量一致。 <br /><br />总结：这篇论文描述了一种新的方法，用于统计确定高纬度太阳自转速率，通过观测极地斑来得出结果。作者发现，南极附近的斑点显示出固定的自转速率约为8.6°/天。 <div>
This paper describes a new way of determining the high-latitude solar rotation rate statistically from simultaneous observations of many polar faculae. In this experiment, I extracted frames from a movie made previously from flat-fielded images obtained in the 6767 Å continuum during 1997–1998 February and used those frames to construct spacetime maps from high-latitude slices of the favorably oriented south polar cap. These maps show an array of slanted tracks whose average slope indicates the east–west speed of faculae at that latitude, λs. When the slopes are measured and plotted as a function of latitude, they show relatively little scatter ∼ 0.01–02 km s−1 from a straight line whose zero-speed extension passes through the Sun’s south pole. This means that the speed, v(λs), and the latitudinal radius, , approach 0 at the same rate, so that their ratio gives a nearly constant synodic rotation rate ∼8.°6 day−1 surrounding the Sun’s south pole. A few measurements of the unfavorably oriented north polar cap are consistent with these measurements near the south pole.

<div> 尘埃颗粒，原行星盘，气体表面密度，尘埃漂移时间，毫米波观测<br />
总结:<br />
本研究通过比较ALMA观测的盘半径和毫米波观测的气体表面密度，自洽地确定了气体和尘埃飘移时间。研究发现，符合测量尘埃质量的气体表面密度剖面具有非常短的漂移时间尺度，比恒星年龄短一个数量级或更长。对于处于重力不稳定边缘的盘，漂移时间尺度与恒星寿命相当。这适用于尘埃质量≳5地球质量的盘，在不到1百万年到10亿年的绝对年龄范围内。所推断的盘质量与恒星质量成比例。这种对毫米波观测的解释同时解决了关于尘埃寿命和外行星质量预算的两个长期问题，并建议将毫米波波长观测视为对具有广泛尺寸分布和大型行星体盘的潜在种群的窗口。 <div>
Millimeter emitting dust grains have sizes that make them susceptible to drift in protoplanetary disks due to the difference between their orbital speed and that of the gas. The characteristic drift timescale depends on the surface density of the gas. By comparing disk radius measurements from Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array CO and continuum observations at millimeter wavelengths, the gas surface density profile and dust drift time can be self-consistently determined. We find that profiles which match the measured dust mass have very short drift timescales, an order of magnitude or more shorter than the stellar age, whereas profiles for disks that are on the cusp of gravitational instability, defined via the minimum value of the Toomre parameter, , have drift timescales comparable to the stellar lifetime. This holds for disks with masses of dust ≳5 M⊕ across a range of absolute ages from less than 1 Myr to over 10 Myr. The inferred disk masses scale with stellar mass as . This interpretation of the gas and dust disk sizes simultaneously solves two long standing issues regarding the dust lifetime and exoplanet mass budget, and suggests that we consider millimeter wavelength observations as a window into an underlying population of particles with a wide size distribution in secular evolution with a massive planetesimal disk.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究报告了在Pierre Auger Observatory进行的为期19年的观测中探测到的超高能宇宙射线到达方向的大尺度各向异性测量结果。研究重建了4个能量段内4 EeV以上的3D偶极子幅度和方向。除了已确认的R.A.大于8 EeV的偶极各向异性外，现在8-16 EeV能量段的傅里叶振幅也超过了5σ的发现水平。在8 EeV以上的偶极矩没有发现时间变化，95%置信水平上将这种变化的变化率上限设置为0.3% yr−1。此外，展示了角功率谱的结果，证明没有其他统计显着的多极子。还首次提出了赤道偶极子分量的结果，使用了针对较低能量优化的触发器所获得的数据集。最后，讨论了模型预测并与观测进行了比较，这是基于在0.6 EeV以上的能谱和成分的联合拟合中获得的两种源发射场景。 <div>
Results are presented for the measurement of large-scale anisotropies in the arrival directions of ultra–high-energy cosmic rays detected at the Pierre Auger Observatory during 19 yr of operation, prior to AugerPrime, the upgrade of the observatory. The 3D dipole amplitude and direction are reconstructed above 4 EeV in four energy bins. Besides the established dipolar anisotropy in R.A. above 8 EeV, the Fourier amplitude of the 8–16 EeV energy bin is now also above the 5σ discovery level. No time variation of the dipole moment above 8 EeV is found, setting an upper limit to the rate of change of such variations of 0.3% yr−1 at the 95% confidence level. Additionally, the results for the angular power spectrum are shown, demonstrating no other statistically significant multipoles. The results for the equatorial dipole component down to 0.03 EeV are presented, using for the first time a data set obtained with a trigger that has been optimized for lower energies. Finally, model predictions are discussed and compared with observations, based on two source emission scenarios obtained in the combined fit of spectrum and composition above 0.6 EeV.

Neutron-induced nuclear reactions play an important role in the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. Their excitation functions are, from an experimental point of view, usually difficult to measure. Nevertheless, in the last decades, big efforts have led to a better understanding of their role in the primordial nucleosynthesis network. In this work, we apply the Trojan Horse Method to extract the cross section at astrophysical energies for the 3He(n,p)3H reaction after a detailed study of the 2H(3He,pt)H three-body process. Data extracted from the present measurement are compared with other published sets. The reaction rate is also calculated, and the impact on the Big Bang nucleosynthesis is examined in detail.

<div> 星系，形成历史，AGN驱动，快速熄灭，红移<br />
总结:<br />
研究表明，在年轻宇宙中的大质量静止星系可以分为三类：相对古老的星系在早期停止形成，最近迅速熄灭的星系，以及经历大规模恒星爆发后最近迅速熄灭的星系。大部分最近熄灭的星系显示中性气体流出，并有电离气体发射，显示出与活动星系核诊断一致的谱线比。这表明，AGN活动驱动多相气体流出，导致快速熄灭。通过追溯整个样本的形成历史，预测了在z = 4-6时期的大质量静止星系的数量密度。样本中的两个老年大质量静止星系可能是在z > 3时期早期恒星爆发的后代。这些星系仍然显示出中性气体储库和微弱的Hα发射，可能是因为导致快速熄灭的喷射式AGN反馈随着时间的推移而减弱。 <div>
Massive quiescent galaxies in the young Universe are expected to be quenched rapidly, but it is unclear whether they all experience starbursts before quenching and what physical mechanism drives rapid quenching. We study 14 massive quiescent galaxies ( ) at z ∼ 2 selected from a representative sample of the Blue Jay survey. We reconstruct their star formation histories (SFHs) by fitting spectral energy distribution models to the JWST/NIRSpec R ∼ 1000 spectra. We find that massive quiescent galaxies can be split into three categories with roughly equal numbers of galaxies according to their SFHs: (1) relatively old galaxies quenched at early epochs; (2) galaxies that are rapidly and recently quenched after a flat or bursty formation history (depending on the assumed prior); and (3) galaxies that are rapidly and recently quenched after a major starburst. Most recently quenched galaxies show neutral gas outflows, probed by blueshifted Na i D absorption, and ionized gas emission, with line ratios consistent with active galactic nucleus (AGN) diagnostics. This suggests that AGN activity drives multiphase gas outflows, leading to rapid quenching. By tracing back the SFHs of the entire sample, we predict the number density of massive quiescent galaxies at z = 4–6: n = (1.5–6.0) × 10−5 Mpc−3. The two old massive quiescent galaxies in our sample appear to have extremely early formation and quenching (z ≳ 6) and are possibly descendants of early post-starbursts at z > 3. These galaxies still show neutral gas reservoirs and weak Hα emission, perhaps because the ejective AGN feedback that caused rapid quenching has weakened over time.

总结:
这篇论文研究了Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey在2018年3月至2021年8月期间探测到的36颗宽线型Ic超新星（SNe Ic-BL）。研究分析了这些超新星的光变曲线，推导了实证参数和爆发时刻，并计算了它们的爆发性质。通过光谱观测，得出了平均的Fe ii 5169 Å线膨胀速度，并计算了玻罗等光变曲线和黑体温度、半径随时间的演化。此外，还研究了13颗超新星的射电观测，发现射电检测和非检测的超新星在光学上的爆发性质上没有明显区别，不存在与射电亮度和光学推测爆发性质之间的显著相关性。这表明仅通过光学数据推断的爆发性质不能揭示关于SNe Ic-BL及其相对论喷流形成机制的射电特性。 <br /><br /> <div>
We study a magnitude-limited sample of 36 broad-lined type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic-BL) from the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey (detected between 2018 March and 2021 August), which is the largest systematic study of SNe Ic-BL done in literature thus far. We present the light curves (LCs) for each of the SNe and analyze the shape of the LCs to derive empirical parameters, along with the explosion epochs for every event. The sample has an average absolute peak magnitude in the r band of mag. Using spectra obtained around peak light, we compute expansion velocities from the Fe ii 5169 Å line for each event with high enough signal-to-noise ratio spectra, and find an average value of km s−1. We also compute bolometric LCs, study the blackbody temperature and radii evolution over time, and derive the explosion properties of the SNe. The explosion properties of the sample have average values of , , and erg. Thirteen events have radio observations from the Very Large Array, with eight detections and five non-detections. We find that the populations that have radio detections and radio non-detections are indistinct from one another with respect to their optically inferred explosion properties, and there are no statistically significant correlations present between the events’ radio luminosities and optically inferred explosion properties. This provides evidence that the explosion properties derived from optical data alone cannot give inferences about the radio properties of SNe Ic-BL and likely their relativistic jet formation mechanisms.

Using a combination of Hubble Space Telescope (HST), JWST, and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) data, we perform spatially resolved spectral energy distributions (SED) fitting of fourteen 4 < z < 6 ultraviolet (UV)-selected main-sequence galaxies targeted by the ALMA Large Program [C ii] Resolved ISM in Star-forming Galaxies. We consistently model the emission from stars and dust in ∼0.5–1 kpc spatial bins to obtain maps of their physical properties. We find no offsets between the stellar masses (M*) and star formation rates (SFRs) derived from their global emission and those from adding up the values in our spatial bins, suggesting there is no bias of outshining by young stars on the derived global properties. We show that ALMA observations are important to derive robust parameter maps because they reduce the uncertainties in Ldust (hence, AV and SFR). Using these maps, we explore the resolved star-forming main sequence for z ∼ 5 galaxies, finding that this relation persists in typical star-forming galaxies in the early Universe. We find less obscured star formation where the M* (and SFR) surface densities are highest, typically in the central regions, contrary to the global relation between these parameters. We speculate this could be caused by feedback driving gas and dust out of these regions. However, more observations of IR luminosities with ALMA are needed to verify this. Finally, we test empirical SFR prescriptions based on the UV+IR and [C ii] line luminosity, finding they work well at the scales probed (approximately kiloparsec). Our work demonstrates the usefulness of joint HST-, JWST-, and ALMA-resolved SED modeling analyses at high redshift.

We present a comprehensive analysis of the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of the extreme high-energy peaked BL Lac source, 1ES 0229+200. Our study utilizes near-simultaneous data collected at various epochs between 2017 September and 2021 August (MJD 58119−59365) from different instruments, including AstroSat−UVIT, Soft X-ray focusing Telescope, LAXPC, Swift−UVOT, Fermi-LAT, and MAGIC. We investigate the one-zone synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model, employing diverse particle distributions such as the log parabola, broken power law, power law with a maximum electron energy γ, energy-dependent diffusion (EDD), and energy-dependent acceleration (EDA) models to fit the broadband SED of the source. Our findings indicate that both peaks in the SED are well described by the one-zone SSC model across all particle distribution models. We estimate the jet power for different particle distributions. The estimated jet power for broken power law particle distributions is found to be on the order of 1047 (1044) erg s−1 for a minimum electron energy ∼10 (104). However, for intrinsically curved particle energy distributions (e.g., log parabola, EDD, and EDA models), the estimated jet power is ∼1044 erg s−1. The SED fitting at five epochs enables us to explore the correlation between the derived spectral parameters of various particle distribution models. Notably, the observed correlations are inconsistent with the predictions in the power-law with a maximum γ model, although the EDD and EDA models yield the correlations as expected. Moreover, the estimated physical parameter values are consistent with the model assumptions.

Population III stars, metal-poor stars, initial mass distribution, supernova explosions, explodability theory <div>
The most metal-poor stars record the earliest metal enrichment triggered by Population III stars. By comparing observed abundance patterns with theoretical yields of metal-free stars, physical properties of their first star progenitors can be inferred, including zero-age main-sequence mass and explosion energy. In this work, the initial mass distribution of the first stars is obtained from the largest analysis to date of 406 very metal-poor stars with the newest LAMOST/Subaru high-resolution spectroscopic observations. However, the mass distribution fails to be consistent with the Salpeter initial mass function, which is also reported by previous studies. Here, we modify the standard power-law function with explodability theory. The mass distribution of Population III stars could be well explained by ensuring that the initial metal enrichment originates from successful supernova explosions. Based on the modified power-law function, we suggest an extremely top-heavy or nearly flat initial mass function with a large exponent for the explosion energy. This indicates that supernova explodability should be considered in the earliest metal enrichment process in the Universe.

总结:
粘性在星团中间介质中的影响仍然是天体物理学中一个未解之谜。通过使用OpenGadget3平滑粒子磁流体动力学代码对三个质量大于1015M⊙的星团进行了宇宙学模拟，以量化粘性的影响并限制其值。研究结果显示粘性引起了小尺度上的显著形态差异、温度变化和密度波动。我们观察到小尺度不稳定性的抑制，导致了更多的小结构和更丝状的结构，同时也由于缺乏与介质的混合。动能向内能的转化导致星团的维里温度增加了大约5%–10%，而密度较高的区域保持较低的温度。密度和速度波动的幅度发现会随粘性增加而增加。然而，与观测数据的比较表明，尽管粘性不同，模拟结果仍然符合密度波动幅度的观测斜率，挑战了通过仅通过密度波动直接限制粘性的观点。此外，密度波动与速度波动的比率不受粘性量的影响，与理论预期一致。我们的结果首次在星团的宇宙学模拟中呈现了粘性在星团中间介质中的影响，而这方面的研究在当前文献中尚未有报道。 <div>
The impact of viscosity in the intracluster medium (ICM) is still an open question in astrophysics. To address this problem, we have run a set of cosmological simulations of three galaxy clusters with a mass larger than MVir > 1015M⊙ at z = 0 using the smoothed particle magnetohydrodynamics-code OpenGadget3. We aim to quantify the influence of viscosity and constrain its value in the ICM. Our results show significant morphological differences at small scales, temperature variations, and density fluctuations induced by viscosity. We observe a suppression of instabilities at small scales, resulting in a more filamentary structure and a larger amount of small structures due to the lack of mixing with the medium. The conversion of kinetic to internal energy leads to an increase of the virial temperature of the cluster of ∼5%–10%, while the denser regions remain cold. The amplitude of density and velocity fluctuations are found to increase with viscosity. However, comparison with observational data indicates that the simulations, regardless of the viscosity, match the observed slope of the amplitude of density fluctuations, challenging the direct constraint of viscosity solely through density fluctuations. Furthermore, the ratio of density to velocity fluctuations remains close to 1 regardless of the amount of viscosity, in agreement with the theoretical expectations. Our results show for the first time in a cosmological simulation of a galaxy cluster the effect of viscosity in the ICM, a study that is currently missing in the literature.

We present the first multifrequency analysis of the candidate ultrasteep spectrum radio halo in the galaxy cluster PLCKESZ G171.94−40.65, using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio telescope (400 MHz), and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (1–2 GHz) observations. Our radio data have been complemented with archival Chandra X-ray observations to provide a crucial insight into the complex intracluster medium physics, happening at large scales. We detect the radio halo emission to the extent of ∼1.5 Mpc at 400 MHz, significantly larger than previously reported, along with five tailed galaxies in the central region. We also report the discovery of an unknown diffuse source “U,” at the cluster periphery, with an extent of 300 kpc. Using the available observations, we have found that the radio spectrum of the halo is well-fitted with a single power law, having a spectral index of −1.36 ± 0.05, indicating that it is not an ultrasteep spectrum radio halo. Our low-resolution (25″) resolved spectral map shows an overall uniform spectral index, with some patches of fluctuations. The X-ray and radio surface brightness are morphologically cospatial, with a slight extension along the northwest–southeast direction, seen in both maps. The radio and X-ray surface brightness indicates strong positive correlations, with sublinear correlation slopes (∼0.71). Multiple tailed galaxies and the radio halo indicate a high dynamical activity at the cluster central region.

本文重点研究M型恒星的恒星风特性及其在TRAPPIST-1和Proxima Centauri等恒星系中可能产生的影响。M型恒星在宇宙中最为常见，由于其尺寸小、温度低，适合用于搜寻宜居区内的太阳系外行星。但是它们的恒星风特性及恒星-行星磁场相互作用可能与太阳系内的情况大不相同。本文通过Alfvén波驱动的恒星风模型，重新评估了M矮星的恒星风特性，并发现TRAPPIST-1行星很可能处于Alfvén表面内，这意味着这些行星可能受到星-行星磁场相互作用的影响。此外，Proxima Cen b与其宿主恒星之间的磁场相互作用可能是最近观测到的无线电发射的原因。这些研究结果有助于我们更好地了解M型恒星及其周围行星的环境特性。 
<br />总结: <br />本文研究了M型恒星的恒星风特性，通过Alfvén波驱动的模型重新评估了TRAPPIST-1和Proxima Centauri等恒星系中的恒星风特性，并指出了可能存在的星-行星磁场相互作用以及其可能引发的无线电发射。 <div>
M-type stars are the most common stars in the Universe. They are ideal hosts for the search of exoplanets in the habitable zone (HZ), as their small size and low temperature make the HZ much closer-in than their solar twins. Harboring very deep convective layers, they also usually exhibit very intense magnetic fields. Understanding their environment, in particular their coronal and wind properties, is thus very important, as they might be very different from what is observed in the solar system. The mass-loss rate of M-type stars is poorly known observationally, and recent attempts to estimate it for some of them (e.g., TRAPPIST-1 and Proxima Centauri) can vary by an order of magnitude. In this work, we revisit the stellar wind properties of M dwarfs in the light of the latest estimates of through Lyα absorption at the astropause and slingshot prominences. We outline a modeling strategy to estimate the mass-loss rate, radiative loss, and wind speed, with uncertainties, based on an Alfvén-wave-driven stellar wind model. We find that it is very likely that several TRAPPIST-1 planets lie within the Alfvén surface, which implies that these planets experience star–planet magnetic interactions (SPMIs). We also find that SPMIs between Proxima Cen b and its host star could be the reason for recently observed radio emissions.

<div> NGC 741, radio observations, galaxy interaction, shock cone, multifrequency
总结:
NGC 741的深度、宽频多频率射电观测揭示了NGC 741-742系统的复杂结构，包括NGC 742的冲击錐、NGC 742的受干扰射流、南部射电尾巴以及东部似叶状结构。同时，观测还显示了尾巴和叶状结构中复杂的射电丝状物质，以及冲击錐后可能存在的涡流环。NGC 742的冲击可能压缩并重新加速了射电等离子体，并向IGrM中注入了大量热能。观测结果还表明，X射线和射电的某些热丝状结构相吻合，暗示了NGC 742尾部的相对论等离子体与周围介质的相互作用。这些发现强调了多频观测对于解析NGC 741中各种射电特征的复杂起源至关重要，同时也需要模拟才能复现所有检测到的特征。 <div>
We present deep, wideband multifrequency radio observations (144 MHz−8 GHz) of the remarkable galaxy group NGC 741, which yield crucial insights into the interaction between the infalling head-tail radio galaxy (NGC 742) and the main group. Our new data provide an unprecedentedly detailed view of the NGC 741-742 system, including the shock cone, disrupted jets from NGC 742, the long (∼255 kpc) braided southern radio tail, and the eastern lobe-like structure (∼100 kpc), and reveal, for the first time, complex radio filaments throughout the tail and lobe, and a likely vortex ring behind the shock cone. The cone traces the bow shock caused by the supersonic ( ) interaction between the head-tail radio galaxy NGC 742 and the intragroup medium (IGrM), while the ring may have been formed by the interaction between the NGC 742 shock and a previously existing lobe associated with NGC 741. This interaction plausibly compressed and reaccelerated the radio plasma. We estimate that shock-heating by NGC 742 has likely injected ∼2–5 × 1057 erg of thermal energy into the central 10 kpc cooling region of the IGrM, potentially affecting the cooling and feedback cycle of NGC 741. A comparison with Chandra X-ray images shows that some of the previously detected thermal filaments align with radio edges, suggesting compression of the IGrM as the relativistic plasma of the NGC 742 tail interacts with the surrounding medium. Our results highlight that multifrequency observations are key to disentangling the complex, intertwined origins of the variety of radio features seen in the galaxy group NGC 741, and the need for simulations to reproduce all the detected features.

<div> 关键词: 超大质量黑洞，活跃星系核，伽马射线暴，相对论性喷流，前向和后向冲击波

总结:
超大质量黑洞（SMBH）在活跃星系核（AGN）中的吸积盘被认为是产生不同类型的伽马射线暴（GRB）的理想地点。通过研究因喷流与AGN盘物质相互作用而导致的反向和正向冲击动力学，发现只有在足够高的亮度和足够长的持续时间下，相对论喷流才能成功从盘中突破。与普通的GRB喷流相比，相对较正常的GRB喷流更容易被窒息在盘中，除非GRB发生在质量相对较低的SMBH附近（例如∼106M⊙）。对于被窒息的喷流来说，与正常的GRB即时和余辉辐射不同，我们只能期望在冲击波非常接近盘的边缘时检测到来自正向冲击的辐射，即冲击波爆发辐射和随后的冲击冷却。 <div>
The accretion disks of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) harboring in active galactic nuclei (AGN) are considered to be an ideal site for producing different types of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The detectability of these GRB phenomena hidden in AGN disks is highly dependent on the dynamical evolution of the GRB relativistic jets. By investigating the reverse- and forward-shock dynamics due to the interaction between the jets and AGN disk material, we find that the relativistic jets can successfully break out from the disks only for a sufficiently high luminosity and a long enough duration. In comparison, relatively normal GRB jets are inclined to be choked in the disks unless the GRBs occur near an SMBH with relatively low mass (e.g., ∼106M⊙). For the choked jets, unlike normal GRB prompt and afterglow emission, we can only expect to detect emission from the forward shock when the shock is very close to the edge of the disks, i.e., at the shock breakout emission and subsequent cooling of the shock.

长型GRB与融合相关，短型GRB与恒星坍缩相关。然而，“奇特GRB”挑战了传统分类。研究发现，长型GRB几乎总是类似于Type I GRB，这暗示融合可能产生T90 > 2s的GRB。而根据红移分布的概率，发现短型GRB几乎表现出与Type II GRB类似的特性，这表明短型Type II GRB的数量并不稀少，而是隐藏在大量没有红移的样本中。这不利于推断射流的进展导致主要辐射被错过。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究分析了机器学习识别的长型Type I GRB和短型Type II GRB候选者的特性，发现长型GRB-I几乎始终表现出与Type I GRB类似的特性，而短型GRB-II几乎表现出与Type II GRB类似的特性。这暗示了融合可能产生T90大于2秒的GRB，而短型Type II GRB的数量并不稀少，而是隐藏在大量没有红移的样本中。 <div>
Traditionally, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are classified as long and short GRBs, with T90 = 2 s being the threshold duration. Generally, long-duration GRBs (LGRBs; T90 > 2 s) are associated with the collapse of massive stars, and short-duration (SGRBs; T90 < 2 s) are associated with compact binary mergers involving at least one neutron star. However, the existence of a population of so-called “peculiar GRBs”—i.e., LGRBs originating from mergers or long Type I GRBs, and SGRBs originating from collapsars or short Type II GRBs—has challenged the traditional paradigm of GRB classification. Finding more peculiar GRBs may help to give more insight into this issue. In this work, we analyze the properties of machine-learning-identified long Type I GRB and short Type II GRB candidates, long GRBs-I and short GRBs-II (the so-called “peculiar GRBs”). We find that long GRBs-I almost always exhibit properties similar to Type I GRBs, which suggests that mergers may indeed produce GRBs with T90 > 2 s. Furthermore, according to the probability given by the redshift distribution, short GRBs-II almost exhibit properties similar to Type II GRBs. This suggests that the populations of short Type II GRBs are not scarce and that they are hidden in a large number of samples without redshifts, which is unfavorable for the interpretation that the jet progression leads to a missed main emission.

We present a broadband spectral analysis of the soft-intermediate and soft states using Insight-HXMT observations of the black hole binary MAXI J1348–630 during its outburst in 2019. We employ a combination of reflection and continuum fitting methods to measure the spin of the black hole and determine a spin of a = 0.79 ± 0.13, which is consistent with most of the previous results. Additionally, we investigate some sources of systematic uncertainty that could bias the measurement. The valid spectral hardening factor can partially account for the spin evolution observed during the outburst. Other potential factors, such as assumptions about the corona’s structure and their interaction with reflected photons, can also affect the accuracy of spin measurements. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that MAXI J1348–630 exhibits a significantly high disk density (∼1022 cm−3), with a moderate iron abundance of approximately 2.5 times solar.

<title>The Ancient Star Formation History of the Extremely Low-mass Galaxy Leo P: An Emerging Trend of a Post-reionization Pause in Star Formation</title>

<div> 关键词: 低质量星系，星形成历史，James Webb太空望远镜，Epoch of Reionization，红移

总结: 本文报告了对低质量孤立星系Leo P的JWST观测结果，揭示了其星形成历史的重要发现。研究发现Leo P在再电离纪时期经历了早期星形成，随后出现了暂停，而后又重新点燃了星形成过程。这与之前研究发现的其他矮星系的星形成历史非常相似。对Leo P的久期星形成历史的发现揭示了在红移约5到1期间星形成的停滞现象，对低质量星系在中间红移的紫外光子产生的贡献具有重要意义。同时，研究还表明，使用两个NIRCam短波长滤波器进行观测优于使用一个短波长和一个长波长滤波器。 <div>
Isolated, low-mass galaxies provide the opportunity to assess the impact of reionization on their star formation histories (SFHs) without the ambiguity of environmental processes associated with massive host galaxies. There are very few isolated, low-mass galaxies that are close enough to determine their SFHs from resolved star photometry reaching below the oldest main-sequence turnoff. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has increased the volume for which this is possible, and here we report on JWST observations of the low-mass, isolated galaxy Leo P. From NIRCam imaging in F090W, F150W, and F277W, we derive an SFH that shows early star formation followed by a pause subsequent to the Epoch of Reionization, which is then later followed by a reignition of star formation. This is very similar to the SFHs from previous studies of other dwarf galaxies in the “transition zone” between quenched very-low-mass galaxies and the more massive galaxies that show no evidence of the impact of reionization on their SFHs; this pattern is rarely produced in simulations of SFHs. The lifetime SFH reveals that Leo P’s stellar mass at the Epoch of Reionization was in the range that is normally associated with being totally quenched. The extended pause in star formation from z ∼ 5 to 1 has important implications for the contribution of low-mass galaxies to the ultraviolet photon budget at intermediate redshifts. We also demonstrate that, due to higher sensitivity and angular resolution, observing in two NIRCam short-wavelength filters is superior to observing in a combination of a short- and a long-wavelength filter.

总结:
本研究对局部（z = 0.0315）活跃星系核(AgN) Mrk 817进行了超过500天的监测，使用了航天器和地面仪器，采用详细建模分析了宽线区域（BLR）、几种区分其光学深度的盘风，以及新的数值模拟。研究发现，扩散的连续光（DC）发射以及强烈而宽广的发射线的附加贡献可以解释在高和低亮度阶段观察到的连续光滞后。我们的BLR模型假设分布在2-122光天距离的受辐射压束缚的云。我们还提出了许多发射线和DC发射的平均发射半径的计算值，并提出了一个简单的、与传递函数相关的方法，将它们与交叉相关滞后的测定联系起来。我们没有发现大光学深度风的明确迹象，但鉴定了较低柱密度风的特征。特别是，我们将观察到的最短连续光滞后与τ(1 Ryd)≈2的风以及部分受到屏蔽的BLR相结合。即使较小光学深度的风，也可能与X射线吸收特征有关，并且会导致一些高电离线的宽度和滞后时间的显著变化，如He ii和C iv。最后，我们展示了环尘发射对i和z波段观察滞后时间的影响。 <div>
The local (z = 0.0315) active galactic nucleus (AGN) Mrk 817 was monitored over more than 500 days with space-borne and ground-based instruments as part of a large international campaign, AGN STORM 2. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the broadband continuum variations using detailed modeling of the broad line region (BLR), several types of disk winds classified by their optical depth, and new numerical simulations. We find that diffuse continuum (DC) emission, with additional contributions from strong and broad emission lines, can explain the continuum lags observed in this source during high- and low-luminosity phases. Disk illumination by the variable X-ray corona contributes only a small fraction of the observed continuum lags. Our BLR models assume radiation-pressure-confined clouds distributed over a distance of 2–122 light days. We present calculated mean emissivity radii of many emission lines, and DC emission, and suggest a simple, transfer-function-dependent method that ties them to cross-correlation lag determinations. We do not find clear indications for large-optical-depth winds, but identify the signature of lower-column-density winds. In particular, we associate the shortest observed continuum lags with a combination of τ(1 Ryd) ≈ 2 wind and a partly shielded BLR. Even smaller optical depth winds may be associated with X-ray absorption features and with noticeable variations in the widths and lags of several high-ionization lines like He ii and C iv. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of torus dust emission on the observed lags in the i and z bands.

Recent constraints on neutron star mass and radius have advanced our understanding of the equation of state (EOS) of cold dense matter. Some of them have been obtained by modeling the pulses of three millisecond X-ray pulsars observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). Here, we present a Bayesian parameter inference for a fourth pulsar, PSR J1231−1411, using the same technique with NICER and XMM-Newton data. When applying a broad mass-inclination prior from radio timing measurements and the emission region geometry model that can best explain the data, we find likely converged results only when using a limited radius prior. If limiting the radius to be consistent with the previous observational constraints and EOS analyses, we infer the radius to be 12.6 ± 0.3 km and the mass to be M⊙, each reported as the posterior credible interval bounded by the 16% and 84% quantiles. If using an uninformative prior but limited between 10 and 14 km, we find otherwise similar results, but km for the radius. In both cases, we find a nonantipodal hot region geometry where one emitting spot is at the equator or slightly above, surrounded by a large colder region, and where a noncircular hot region lies close to southern rotational pole. If using a wider radius prior, we only find solutions that fit the data significantly worse. We discuss the challenges in finding the better fitting solutions, possibly related to the weak interpulse feature in the pulse profile.

We solve for waves in a polytropic, stratified plasma with a spatially varying background magnetic field that points along the horizontal x-direction, and with gravity that is directed along the vertical z-direction. Force balance determines the magnitude of the background magnetic field, , where n is the polytropic index. Using numerical and asymptotic methods, we deduce an explicit dispersion relation for fast pressure-driven waves: + . Here, Ω is the frequency, K is the wavenumber, θ is the angle the wavevector makes with the background magnetic field, MA is the Alfvénic Mach number, and m is an integer representing the eigenstate. We discuss the roles of such an explicit formula in asteroseismology.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Magnetar-like activity has been observed in a large variety of neutron stars. PSR J1846−0258 is a young 327 ms radio-quiet pulsar with a large rotational power (∼8 × 1036 erg s−1), and resides at the center of the supernova remnant Kes 75. It is one of the rare examples of a high-magnetic-field pulsar showing characteristics both of magnetars and radio pulsars, and can thus provide important clues on the differences in the emission mechanisms between these two classes. In 2006, PSR J1846−0258 was detected to undergo an outburst for the first time, accompanied by a large flux increase, millisecond X-ray bursts, significant spectral changes, and a large timing glitch. In the period between 2020 May and June, after 14 yr of quiescent stable emission, the source underwent a second magnetar-like outburst, which was followed up with several observations by Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and Swift. In this work, we report on the long-term timing and X-ray spectral properties of the source following the 2020 outburst, and place upper limits on any source activity at radio wavelengths. We demonstrate that the pulsed flux increased by a factor >6 during the outburst, followed by nontrivial variability in the spin-down rate. Our timing analysis shows that the spin frequency and its derivative are clearly affected by magnetospheric activity due to the outburst. We find hints for an oscillation in the frequency derivative with a timescale of 50–60 days, recovering later on to stable quiescence.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了长伽马射线暴（GRBs）的星亲星可能被在巴赛克尺度距离上存在的一个重要且复杂的星云结构所围绕。在GRB射流释放能量后，射流将与这个星云环境相互作用。作者指出，在大部分情况下，射流冲击波与风终结（逆向）冲击的相互作用会比较弱，并且可能导致前驱辐射。另外，当射流冲击波遇到压缩至风和星际介质的接触不连续面时，新形成的逆向冲击产生了一次明亮的同步辐射闪耀。这个闪耀预计会在最初爆炸后大约100秒左右被观察到。因此，这个延迟的辐射构成了GRB的环周介质阶段，其物理起源不同于前期的快速爆发和后期的余辉阶段。环周介质阶段的辐射可以为观察到有前期辐射的、随后是强烈、以同步辐射为主的主要阶段的GRBs提供一个自然的解释。因此，正确识别辐射阶段对推断GRB星亲周围环境的性质至关重要。 <div>
Progenitor stars of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) could be surrounded by a significant and complex nebula structure lying at a parsec-scale distance. After the initial release of energy from the GRB jet, the jet will interact with this nebula environment. We show here that for a large, plausible parameter space region, the interaction between the jet blast wave and the wind termination (reverse) shock is expected to be weak, and may be associated with a precursor emission. As the jet blast wave encounters the contact discontinuity separating the shocked wind and the shocked interstellar medium, we find that a bright flash of synchrotron emission from the newly formed reverse shock is produced. This flash is expected to be observed at around ∼100 s after the initial explosion and precursor. Such a delayed emission thus constitutes a circumburst medium (CBM) phase in a GRB, having a physically distinct origin from the preceding prompt phase and the succeeding afterglow phase. The CBM phase emission may thus provide a natural explanation for bursts observed to have a precursor followed by an intense, synchrotron-dominated main episode that is found in a substantial minority, ∼10% of GRBs. A correct identification of the emission phase is thus required to infer the properties of the flow and of the immediate environment around GRB progenitors.

在这篇文章中，作者使用了高斯-博尔茨曼模型来预测银河系类似星系中解体星团的总数、质量和径向分布。他们还通过模拟这些祖先星团的轨道历史生成了虚拟的恒星串流，考虑了星团的形成和并入时间、质量和金属丰度。结果显示，在银河中，约9000个质量大于104M⊙的星团已经在中央星团溶解并在目前完全混合，而剩下的约1000个形成了一致的恒星串流。这表明目前对银河中约80个星团串流的普查严重不完整，15千秒巴赫光度（g ≲ 27.5）的深度拉宾光度测量将能够检测到这些串流，即使是距离银河中心超过75千秒巴赫的最遥远的串流。研究还发现M31在30-100千秒巴赫的银心辐射范围内将有大量串流存在。作者总结指出，未来的调查将发现大量来自星团的恒星串流，并可用于暗物质亚环的搜索。 <br /><br />总结: 作者使用高斯-博尔茨曼模型预测银河系类似星系中解体星团的总数、质量和径向分布。根据模拟结果，约9000个星团已经在中央星团溶解并在目前完全混合，而剩下的约1000个形成了一致的恒星串流。未来的调查将发现大量来自星团的恒星串流，并可用于暗物质亚环的搜索。 <div>
Thin stellar streams originating from globular clusters (GCs) are among the most sensitive tracers of low-mass dark matter subhalos. Joint analysis of the entire population of stellar streams will place the most robust constraints on the dark matter subhalo mass function, and therefore the nature of dark matter. Here we use a hierarchical model of GC formation to forecast the total number, masses, and radial distribution of dissolved GC in Milky Way–like galaxies. Furthermore, we generate mock stellar streams from these progenitors’ orbital histories taking into account the clusters’ formation and accretion times, mass, and metallicity. Out of ∼10,000 clusters more massive than 104M⊙, ∼9000 dissolved in the central bulge and are fully phase mixed at the present, while the remaining ∼1000 survive as coherent stellar streams. This suggests that the current census of ∼80 GC streams in the Milky Way is severely incomplete. Beyond 15 kpc from the Galactic center we are missing ∼100 streams, of which the vast majority are from accreted GCs. Deep Rubin photometry (g ≲ 27.5) would be able to detect these streams, even the most distant ones beyond >75 kpc. We also find that M31 will have an abundance of streams at galactocentric radii of 30–100 kpc. We conclude that future surveys will find a multitude of stellar streams from GCs, which can be used for dark matter subhalo searches.

The Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a cosmic-ray detector as well as a pair-converting γ-ray telescope. The effective area, reflecting the geometrical cross-section area, the γ-ray conversion probability, and the photon selection efficiency, is important in γ-ray analyses. In this work, we find a significant time variation in the effective area, as large as ∼−4% yr−1 at 2 GeV for the high-energy trigger. We derive the data-based correction factors to the effective areas and apply corrections to both the effective areas and the exposure maps. The calibrated exposure can be ∼12% smaller than the Monte Carlo one on average at 2 GeV. The calibration is further verified using the observation of the Vela pulsar, showing the spectral parameters with the correction are more consistent with those in the Fermi-LAT catalog than the ones without correction. All the corrections are now implemented in the latest version of the DAMPE γ-ray analysis toolkit DmpST.

总结:
X射线爆发和快速射电爆发之间存在关联，但其确切起源仍不清楚。文章提出了三种模型：火球的共振旋转散射、极向阻滞膨胀火球的流出以及远处相对论冲击的同步辐射。研究者通过计算每个模型的X射线光谱，并拟合观测数据，然后计算相应的偏振信号。发现这三种模型在相位/时间和能量变化的偏振模式上有所不同，可以通过未来的X射线极化观测来验证模型。 <div>
The origin of an extraordinary X-ray burst (XRB) associated with a fast radio burst (FRB) such as FRB 20200428 is still unclear, though several models, such as the emission of a trapped fireball modified by resonant cyclotron scattering, the outflow from a polar trapped-expanding fireball, and the synchrotron radiation of a far-away relativistic shock, have been proposed. To determine which model is true, we study the possible X-ray polarization signature for each model, inspired by the importance of radio polarization in identifying the FRB origin. We first numerically simulate or calculate the XRB spectrum for each model and fit it to the observed data, then compute the corresponding polarization signal based on the fit. We find that these three models predict different polarization patterns in terms of phase/time and energy variations. The differences can be used to test the models with future X-ray polarization observations.

We present periodicity search analyses on the long-term γ-ray light curve of the BL Lacertae object 4FGL J2139.4−4235 observed by the Fermi Large Area Telescope, over a period of more than 15 yr, from 2008 August 4 to 2023 December 10. To determine the quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) behavior of 4FGL J2139.4−4235 in the 0.3–300 GeV energy range, we used four methods, namely the Lomb–Scargle periodogram, the weighted wavelet z-transform, the phase dispersion minimization, and the autoregressive integrated moving average model. A Monte Carlo simulation technique is used to evaluate the significance level of the QPO signal. Significant levels above 3.5σ were detected in the γ-ray light curve at about 650 days QPO, which is presented throughout the observation period. Interestingly, there was some correlation between the three bands in the discrete correlation function method calculations, which may be an indication that the variability trends between the three bands are similar. We explore the possible physical models and show that a supermassive binary black hole system or a jet helical motion model seem to be reasonable explanations for the potential QPO behavior.

Planet–disk interactions can produce kinematic signatures in protoplanetary disks. While recent observations have detected non-Keplerian gas motions in disks, their origins are still being debated. To explore this, we conduct 3D hydrodynamic simulations using the code FARGO3D to study nonaxisymmetric kinematic perturbations at two scale heights induced by Jovian planets in protoplanetary disks, followed by examinations of detectable signals in synthetic CO emission line observations at millimeter wavelengths. We advocate for using residual velocity or channel maps, generated by subtracting an azimuthally averaged background of the disk, to identify planet-induced kinematic perturbations. We investigate the effects of two basic simulation parameters, simulation duration and numerical resolution, on the simulation results. Our findings suggest that a short simulation (e.g., 100 orbits) is insufficient to establish a steady velocity pattern given our chosen viscosity (α = 10−3) and displays plenty of fluctuations on an orbital timescale. Such transient features could be detected in observations. By contrast, a long simulation (e.g., 1000 orbits) is required to reach steady state in kinematic structures. At 1000 orbits, the strongest detectable velocity structures are found in the spiral wakes close to the planet. Through numerical convergence tests, we find hydrodynamics results converge in spiral regions at a resolution of 14 cells per disk scale height or higher. Meanwhile, synthetic observations produced from hydrodynamic simulations at different resolutions are indistinguishable with 0.″1 angular resolution and 10 hr of integration time on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array.

<br /><br />总结:
本文讨论了暗物质的聚集现象与其质量（主要偏差）和内部性质（次要偏差）之间的关系。研究表明，暗物质的聚集不仅取决于其质量，还与其内部属性有关。之前将次要偏差归因于不同背景下暗物质的合并速率，称之为组装偏差，但实际上合并对内部属性没有留下痕迹。更现实的峰值模型表明，暗物质种子由峰值曲率确定，不同背景下的峰值具有不同的平均曲率，这决定了它们演化为具有不同内部属性的暗物质聚集。对暗物质聚集的背景（或聚集）的内部属性依赖性进行了验证，结果与模拟的结果相吻合。 <div>
The clustering of dark matter halos depends not only on their mass, the so-called primary bias, but also on their internal properties, the so-called secondary bias. While the former effect is well understood within the Press–Schechter and excursion set models of structure formation, the latter is not. In those models, protohalos are fully characterized by their height and scale, which determine the halo mass and collapse time, so there is no room for any other halo property. This is why the secondary bias was believed not to be innate but due to the distinct merger rate of halos lying in different backgrounds, and dubbed assembly bias. However, it has now been determined that mergers leave no imprint in the inner halo properties. In fact, the innate origin of the secondary bias cannot be discarded because, in the more realistic peak model of structure formation, halo seeds are characterized by one additional property: the peak curvature. Here, we use the confluent system of peak trajectory formalism to show that peaks lying in different backgrounds have different mean curvatures, which in turn cause them to evolve into halos with different typical inner properties. The dependence we find of the properties on halo background (or halo clustering) reproduces the results of simulations.

Our analyses reveal a rotation period of EPIC 248705247 of approximately 6.82 ± 0.07 hr, making it one of the most rapidly rotating DBV stars currently known. We utilize the White Dwarf Evolution Code (WDEC) to compute models to look for the seismic best-fitted model, yielding the following stellar parameters: M/M⊙ = 0.650 ± 0.003, Teff = 23,660 ± 68 K, and . We also explore the phenomenon of mode trapping, as well as the potential influence of a weak magnetic field. We find that this star is located near the red edge of the theoretical instability strip of DBVs. Hence, our asteroseismological analysis of EPIC 248705247 provides the properties and behaviors of a rapidly rotating DBV.

We investigate the long-term persistence of the time series of energetic neutral atom (ENA) fluxes recorded by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX). ENAs provide global information about the outer heliosphere and its interactions with the very local interstellar medium. To avoid the IBEX Ribbon, here, we focus our analysis solely on the polar regions N60°–N90° and S60°–S90°. Each year, IBEX takes two measurements of every pixel in the sky. We make use of the whole set of 14 yr of IBEX data and adhere to the correct time order for the construction of the flux time series. We examine in detail both the trend and the fluctuations of these time series. Using modern methods of time series analysis and persistence characterization, we show that the time series (i) trend is influenced by the solar cycle, (ii) persistence can be established independently of the presence of this trend, and (iii) statistical properties of the fluctuations differs between north and south, pointing to the existence of anisotropy and thus a north–south asymmetry.

总结: 中子星表面的辐射对质量吸积率产生影响，X射线爆发会导致Poynting–Robertson (PR) 拖曳对质量吸积盘的影响，提高质量吸积率。观测发现X射线爆发期间盘生成的持续辐射的标准化因子fa增加，fa的变化被用来推断质量吸积率的演化。研究使用模拟数据考察了fa与质量吸积率增强之间的关系，发现fa与盘温度强相关，但与质量吸积率的关联性较弱。同时，加热导致盘以更高能量辐射，减小其对软过量的贡献。因此，fa不能准确捕捉质量吸积率的增强，而更像是盘温度的示踪器。 <br /> <div>
The accretion flow onto a neutron star will be impacted by irradiation from a type I X-ray burst. The burst radiation exerts Poynting–Robertson (PR) drag on the accretion disk, leading to an enhanced mass accretion rate. Observations of X-ray bursts often find evidence that the normalization of the disk-generated persistent emission (commonly denoted by the factor fa) increases during a burst, and changes in fa have been used to infer the evolution of the mass accretion rate due to PR drag. Here, we examine this proposed relationship between fa and mass accretion rate enhancement using time-resolved data from simulations of accretion disks impacted by type I X-ray bursts. We consider bursts from both spinning and nonspinning neutron stars and track both the change in accretion rate due to PR drag and the disk emission spectra during the burst. Regardless of the neutron star spin, we find that fa strongly correlates with the disk temperature and only weakly follows the mass accretion rate (the Pearson correlation coefficients are ≤0.63 in the latter case). Additionally, heating causes the disk to emit at higher energies, reducing its contribution to a soft excess. We conclude that fa cannot accurately capture the mass accretion rate enhancement and is rather a tracer of the disk temperature.

Stellar ultraviolet (UV) emission serves as a crucial indicator for estimating magnetic activity and evaluating the habitability of exoplanets orbiting stars. In this paper, we present a straightforward method to derive stellar photospheric UV emission for F to M main-sequence stars. By using PARSEC models, we establish relations between near-UV (NUV) and far-UV (FUV) magnitudes from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer, NUV magnitudes from the China Space Station Telescope, and stellar effective temperatures and Gaia blue photometer–red photometer colors for different metallicities. Together with the observed sample, we find that for NUV emission, the photospheric contribution to the observed flux is less than 20% for M stars, around 10%–70% for K stars, and in a range from 30% to 85% for G and F stars. For FUV emission, the photospheric contribution is less than 10−6 for M stars, below 10−4 for K stars, around 10−4–10% for G stars, and between 6% and 50% for F stars. Our work enables the simple and effective determination of stellar excess UV emission and the exploration of magnetic activity.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Self-consistent strong plasma screening around light nuclei is implemented in the Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) epoch to determine the short-range screening potential, eϕ(r)/T ≥ 1, relevant for thermonuclear reactions. We numerically solve the nonlinear Poisson–Boltzmann equation incorporating Fermi–Dirac statistics, adopting a generalized screening mass to find the electric potential in the cosmic BBN electron–positron plasma for finite-sized α particles (4He++) as an example. Although the plasma follows Boltzmann statistics at large distances, Fermi–Dirac statistics is necessary when work performed by ions on electrons is comparable to their rest-mass energy. While self-consistent strong screening effects are generally minor owing to the high BBN temperatures, they can enhance the fusion rates of high-Z (Z > 2) elements while leaving fusion rates of lower-Z (Z ≤ 2) elements relatively unaffected. Our results also reveal a pronounced spatial dependence of the self-consistent strong screening potential near the nuclear surface. These findings about the electron–positron plasma’s role refine BBN theory predictions and offer broader applications for studying weakly coupled plasmas in diverse cosmic and laboratory settings.

<div> UV-bright galaxies, ultralight axion (ULA) dark matter, abundance, redshift, Hubble Space Telescope (HST)

总结:
本研究通过对Hubble Space Telescope (HST)观测的24,000个源的紫外光度函数（UVLF）数据进行分析，计算了紫外亮星系在超轻轴子（ULA）暗物质存在下的丰度。研究发现，轴子对紫外亮星系的形成有非平凡的抑制作用，并且这种抑制与红移和光度有关。通过对UVLF数据的分析，得出了轴子暗物质的限制，排除了单一轴子占据所有暗物质的可能性，并且限制了轴子占据暗物质的上限为22%（在95%的置信水平下）。这些高红移的测量结果为低红移轴子暗物质的检验提供了一个有力的一致性检查，并且未来James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) 的测量有望改善这些结果。同时，研究还发现了在z < 3时低质量暗物质（<109M⊙）的过剩，这可以通过亚星系结构探测（例如星流、卫星星系和强引力透镜）来研究。 <div>
We calculate the abundance of UV-bright galaxies in the presence of ultralight axion (ULA) dark matter (DM), finding that axions suppress their formation with a non-trivial dependence on redshift and luminosity. We set limits on axion DM using UV luminosity function (UVLF) data, excluding a single axion as all the DM for max < 10−21.6 eV and limiting axions with to be less than 22% of the DM (both at 95% credibility). These limits use UVLF measurements from 24,000 sources from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) at redshifts 4 ≤ z ≤ 10. We marginalize over a parametric model connecting halo mass and UV luminosity. Our results bridge a window in axion mass and fraction previously unconstrained by cosmological data, between large-scale cosmic microwave background and galaxy clustering and the small-scale Lyα forest. These high-z measurements provide a powerful consistency check of low-z tests of axion DM, including the recent hint for a sub-dominant ULA DM fraction in Lyα forest data. We also consider a sample of 25 spectroscopically confirmed high-z galaxies from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), finding these data to be consistent with HST. Combining HST and JWST UVLF data does not improve our constraints beyond HST alone, but future JWST measurements have the potential to improve these results. We also find an excess of low-mass halos (<109M⊙) at z < 3, which could be probed by subgalactic structure probes (e.g., stellar streams, satellite galaxies, and strong lensing).

SS 433是一个微类星，其高能伽马射线发射在HAWC观测中首次被解析。研究报告了东部喷流和西部喷流的点源检测结果，能谱分析显示两者符合简单的幂律分布，最大光子能量分别达到56 TeV和123 TeV。这表明高能伽马射线可能是通过高效加速的电子产生的。因此，研究提供了对SS 433微类星高能天体物理现象的重要观测和理论解释。 <br /><br />总结: <br />SS 433微类星的高能伽马射线发射首次被HAWC观测解析，分析结果显示喷流发出的伽马射线能谱符合简单的幂律分布，并最大光子能量达到极高水平，表明可能由高效加速的电子产生。 <div>
Very-high-energy (0.1–100 TeV) gamma-ray emissions were observed in High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) data from the lobes of the microquasar SS 433, making them the first set of astrophysical jets that were resolved at TeV energies. In this work, we update the analysis of SS 433 using 2565 days of data from the HAWC observatory. Our analysis reports the detection of a point-like source in the east lobe at a significance of 6.6σ and in the west lobe at a significance of 8.2σ. For each jet lobe, we localize the gamma-ray emission and identify a best-fit position. The locations are close to the X-ray emission sites “e1” and “w1” for the east and west lobes, respectively. We analyze the spectral energy distributions and find that the energy spectra of the lobes are consistent with a simple power law dN/dE ∝ Eα with and for the east and west lobes, respectively. The maximum energy of photons from the east and west lobes reaches 56 TeV and 123 TeV, respectively. We compare our observations to various models and conclude that the very-high-energy gamma-ray emission can be produced by a population of electrons that were efficiently accelerated.

HOPS 87是一个0级原恒星核心，其中含有一个极为年轻的双极分子流和一个热角碱。研究发现，在HOPS 87的双边分子流基部附近存在富含H2CO、13CS、H2S、OCS和CH3OH等分子的局部化学丰富区域，这些分子是最简单的复杂有机分子。这些局部特征的位置和动力学表明，这些区域是由喷流驱动的震波造成的，而不是热角碱区域的一部分。这些区域中分子气体的复杂有机分子组成相对较简单，我们推测这种简单性可能是由于冰的释放具有较简单的化学历史，或者是由于震波化学的影响。我们的研究突显了原恒星双极分子流、盘、内核环境和周围介质之间的动态相互作用，有助于我们理解类似太阳的年轻恒星物体中的分子复杂性。<br /><br />总结: HOPS 87是一个具有极年轻双极分子流和热角碱的原恒星核心。在其双极分子流基部附近发现了富含多种分子的局部化学丰富区域，这些区域的特征是由喷流驱动的震波造成的。这些区域中的分子气体的复杂有机分子组成相对较简单，有助于我们理解类似太阳的年轻恒星物体中的分子复杂性。 <div>
HOPS 87 is a Class 0 protostellar core known to harbor an extremely young bipolar outflow and a hot corino. We report the discovery of localized, chemically rich regions near the bases of the two-lobe bipolar molecular outflow in HOPS 87 containing molecules such as H2CO, 13CS, H2S, OCS, and CH3OH, the simplest complex organic molecule (COM). The locations and kinematics suggest that these localized features are due to jet-driven shocks rather than being part of the hot-corino region encasing the protostar. The COM compositions of the molecular gas in these jet-localized regions are relatively simpler than those in the hot-corino zone. We speculate that this simplicity is due to either the liberation of ice with a less complex chemical history or the effects of shock chemistry. Our study highlights the dynamic interplay between the protostellar bipolar outflow, disk, inner-core environment, and the surrounding medium, contributing to our understanding of molecular complexity in solar-like young stellar objects.

<div> refractory organics, C carrier, protosolar nebula, Kuiper Belt objects, CI chondrites
<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了在外太阳前星云中作为碳主要携带者的耐火性有机物的作用，以及对大冥王星带对象（KBOs）和CI球粒陨石组成的影响。通过利用罗塞塔对彗星67P / Churyumov-Gerasimenko中的耐火性有机物的测量，我们发现根据目前广泛采用的太阳丰度，它们将占据KBO形成区域中前太阳C库存的很大一部分。然而，这将释放出太多的氧来形成水冰，产生的固体物质不够富含岩石，无法解释冥王星-卡戎系统和其他大型KBOs的未压缩密度；前者被认为是我们对大型KBOs的整体组成最具代表性的值。这种不一致进一步凸显了太阳丰度问题 - 在调和光谱测定的重元素丰度与太阳强度约束之间存在的挑战。通过使用来自太阳CNO中微子和太阳风测量的新数据集，我们展示了冥王星-卡戎系统的未压缩密度可以在各种情况下得到复制。我们发现龙宫和奔努样本中缺少硫酸盐意味着最初聚集到CI球粒陨石母体中的水冰量比以前认为的要少。这些数据与新数据集所暗示的太阳C / O比一致。我们的预测可以通过未来的中微子，太阳地震学和宇宙化学测量来进行验证。 <div>
We examine the role of refractory organics as a major C carrier in the outer protosolar nebula and its implications for the compositions of large Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) and CI chondrites. By utilizing Rosetta measurements of refractory organics in comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, we show that they would make up a large fraction of the protosolar C inventory in the KBO-forming region based on the current widely adopted solar abundances. However, this would free up too much O to form water ice, producing solid material that is not sufficiently rock-rich to explain the uncompressed density of the Pluto–Charon system and other large KBOs; the former has been argued as the most representative value we have for the bulk composition of large KBOs. This inconsistency further highlights the solar abundances problem—an ongoing challenge in reconciling spectroscopically determined heavy-element abundances with helioseismology constraints. By employing a new data set from solar CNO neutrinos and solar wind measurements of C, N, and O, we show that the uncompressed density of the Pluto–Charon system can be reproduced over a wide range of scenarios. We show that a lack of sulfates in Ryugu and Bennu samples implies a lower amount of water ice initially accreted into CI chondrite parent bodies than previously thought. These data are found to be consistent with the solar C/O ratio implied by the new data set. Our predictions can be tested by future neutrino, helioseismology, and cosmochemical measurements.

该研究发现，早期宇宙中的星系似乎以比预期更快的速度成长和组装成大规模星系。这与ΛCDM结构形成范式的预期不符。现有的光度数据表明，在z≳10时期形成了一群大质量星系，并在短时间内（≲1 Gyr）迅速停止形成新星，符合传统的巨型椭圆星系演化模型。类似地，动力学观测显示，在早期已经存在大质量螺旋星系及其尺度关系。解释大规模星系的早期形成需要在z>10时期出现极高效率的重子转化成恒星，或者比ΛCDM预期的更快速的重子组装。后一种可能性正是修正牛顿动力学（MOND）提前明确预测的。我们还讨论了MOND的一些进一步预测，如星系团的早期形成和早期再电离。<br /><br />总结: 该研究发现早期宇宙中的大规模星系形成速度比预期更快，与传统模型不符。其中一种可能性是修正牛顿动力学提前预测的，还讨论了修正牛顿动力学的一些进一步预测。 <div>
Galaxies in the early Universe appear to have grown too big too fast, assembling into massive, monolithic objects more rapidly than anticipated in the hierarchical Lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM) structure formation paradigm. The available photometric data are consistent with there being a population of massive galaxies that form early (z ≳ 10) and quench rapidly over a short (≲1 Gyr) timescale, consistent with the traditional picture for the evolution of giant elliptical galaxies. Similarly, kinematic observations as a function of redshift show that massive spirals and their scaling relations were in place at early times. Explaining the early emergence of massive galaxies requires either an extremely efficient conversion of baryons into stars at z > 10 or a more rapid assembly of baryons than anticipated in ΛCDM. The latter possibility was explicitly predicted in advance by modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). We discuss some further predictions of MOND, such as the early emergence of clusters of galaxies and early reionization.

总结: 
生命在地球上的独特生物标志是有机化合物的手性选择性。本文提出了磁性对齐尘埃颗粒可能是自旋极化电子来源，这些电子通过巴耐特效应被光电发射出来。这些自旋极化电子可能对星际尘埃颗粒上的手性分子产生非对称的影响。通过研究发现，这一机制可能解释了在众多彗星、小行星和陨石中检测到的生命前分子的手性不对称性。同时，在尘埃颗粒和气体中，电子自旋的磁性对齐效应在电子的运动过程中可能是可以忽略的。 <div>
The unique biosignature of life on Earth is the homochirality of organic compounds, such as amino acids, proteins, and sugars. High-energy spin-polarized (spinup or spindown) electrons (SPEs) from the β decay of radioactive nuclei have been proposed as a source of symmetry breaking, leading to homochirality; however, their exact role is much debated. Here, we propose magnetically aligned dust grains as a new source of SPEs, due to the photoemission of electrons having aligned spins by the Barnett effect. For the interstellar UV radiation field of strength GUV, we find that the SPE emission rate is electrons per second per H, the fraction of spin-polarized to total photoelectrons is ∼10%, and the SPE yield (photoelectron number per UV photon) can reach ∼1%, using the modern theory of grain alignment. SPEs emitted from aligned grains could play an important role in chiral-induced spin-selectivity-driven reduction chemistry in the icy grain mantles, producing an enantiomer excess of chiral molecules formed on the grain mantle. Finally, we suggest magnetically aligned grains could directly impact the enantio-selectivity through the chiral-induced spin-selective adsorption effect and exchange interaction. We estimate the disalignment of electron spins and depolarization by elastic scattering using the Mott theory and find that these effects are negligible for low-energy SPEs, so that the spins of SPEs remain well aligned during their journey through dust grains and the gas. Our proposed mechanism might explain the chiral asymmetry of prebiotic molecules detected in numerous comets, asteroids, and meteorites.

<div> Hubble Space Telescope, Poststarburst galaxies, quiescent, structural fitting, compact size<br />
总结:<br />
本研究使用Hubble Space Telescope观测了171个大质量后爆发星系的图像，并进行了结构拟合分析。研究发现，这些后爆发星系比普通静止星系更紧凑，但其核心表面质量密度与静止星系相似。这些后爆发星系呈现圆形投影，主要是3D中的球状体，而不是盘状星系。此外，研究表明后爆发星系的大小或中心密度与熄灭时间间隔之间不存在相关性，这排除了由于星暴消退导致的结构增长。相反，研究推测这些大质量星系的快速熄灭更倾向于发生在具有预先紧凑结构的星系中。 <div>
Poststarburst galaxies (PSBs) are young quiescent galaxies that have recently experienced a rapid decrease in star formation, allowing us to probe the fast-quenching period of galaxy evolution. In this work, we obtained Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/WFC3 F110W imaging to measure the sizes of 171 massive ( spectroscopically identified PSBs at 1 < z 1.3 selected from the DESI Survey Validation luminous red galaxy sample. This statistical sample constitutes an order of magnitude increase from the ∼20 PSBs with space-based imaging and deep spectroscopy. We perform structural fitting of the target galaxies with pysersic and compare them to quiescent and star-forming galaxies in the 3D-HST survey. We find that these PSBs are more compact than the general population of quiescent galaxies, lying systematically ∼0.1 dex below the established size–mass relation. However, their central surface mass densities are similar to those of their quiescent counterparts ( ). These findings are easily reconciled by later ex situ growth via minor mergers or a slight progenitor bias. These PSBs are round in projection (b/amedian ∼ 0.8), suggesting that they are primarily spheroids, not disks, in 3D. We find no correlation between the time since quenching and light-weighted PSB sizes or central densities. This disfavors apparent structural growth due to the fading of centralized starbursts in this galaxy population. Instead, we posit that the fast quenching of massive galaxies at this epoch occurs preferentially in galaxies with preexisting compact structures.

Ultrahot Jupiters (UHJs), being the hottest class of exoplanets known, provide a unique laboratory for testing atmospheric interactions with internal planetary magnetic fields at a large range of temperatures. Thermal ionization of atmospheric species on the dayside of these planets results in charged particles becoming embedded in the planet’s mostly neutral wind. The charges will resist flow across magnetic field lines as they are dragged around the planet and ultimately alter the circulation pattern of the atmosphere. We model this process to study this effect on high-resolution emission and transmission spectra in order to identify observational signatures of the magnetic circulation regime that exist across multiple UHJs. Using a state-of-the-art kinematic MHD/active drag approach in a 3D atmospheric model, we simulate three different UHJs with and without magnetic effects. We postprocess these models to generate high-resolution emission and transmission spectra and explore trends in the net Doppler shift as a function of phase. In emission spectra, we find that the net Doppler shift before and after secondary eclipse can be influenced by the presence of magnetic drag and the wavelength choice. Trends in transmission spectra show our active drag models consistently produce a unique shape in their Doppler shift trends that differs from the models without active drag. This work is a critical theoretical step to understanding how magnetic fields shape the atmospheres of UHJs and provides some of the first predictions in high-resolution spectroscopy for observing these effects.

We investigate the multiphase structure of gas flows in galaxies. We study 80 galaxies during the epoch of peak star formation (1.4 ≤ z ≤ 2.7) using data from the Keck/Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) and the Very Large Telescope/K-Band Multi-Object Spectrograph (KMOS). Our analysis provides a simultaneous probe of outflows using UV emission and absorption features and Hα emission. With this unprecedented data set, we examine the properties of gas flows estimated from LRIS and KMOS in relation to other galaxy properties, such as star formation rate (SFR), SFR surface density (ΣSFR), stellar mass (M*), and main-sequence offset (ΔMS). We find no strong correlations between outflow velocity measured from rest-UV line centroids and galaxy properties. However, we find that galaxies with detected outflows show higher averages in SFR, ΣSFR, and ΔMS than those lacking outflow detections, indicating a connection between outflow and galaxy properties. Furthermore, we find a lower average outflow velocity than previously reported, suggesting greater absorption at the systemic redshift of the galaxy. Finally, we detect outflows in 49% of our LRIS sample and 30% in the KMOS sample and find no significant correlation between outflow detection and inclination. These results may indicate that outflows are not collimated and that Hα outflows have a lower covering fraction than low-ionization interstellar absorption lines. Additionally, these tracers may be sensitive to different physical scales of outflow activity. A larger sample size with a wider dynamic range in galaxy properties is needed to further test this picture.

The accretion/ejection processes in T Tauri stars are fundamental to their physical evolution, while also impacting the properties and evolution of the circumstellar material at a time when planet formation takes place. To date, the characterization of ongoing accretion processes in stellar pairs at 5–50 au scales has been challenging as high-angular resolution spectrographs are required to extract the spectral features of each component. We present the analysis of spectroscopic observations of the tight (160 mas, 25 au) T Tauri system HT Lup A/B, obtained with MUSE at the Very Large Telescope in 2021 March and July. We focus on constraining the accretion/ejection processes and variability of the secondary component HT Lup B by searching for accretion tracers by applying high-resolution spectral differential imaging techniques. We retrieve strong (signal-to-noise ratio > 5) Hα, Hβ, and [O i]λ6300 emission in both epochs. The Hα and Hβ line fluxes showcase high variability, with variations up to 200%–300% between epochs. The fluxes are consistent with accretion rates of 3× 10−9M⊙ yr−1 and 8 × 10−10M⊙ yr−1 for the first and second epochs, respectively. We attribute the increased accretion activity during the first night to a “burst-like” event, followed by a relaxation period more representative of the common accretion activity of the system. The [O i]λ6300 line profiles remain relatively similar between epochs and suggest ejection rates on the order of 10−9−10−10M⊙ yr−1, compatible with moderate disk wind emission. Our results also indicate that the accretion processes of HT Lup B are compatible with Classical T Tauri stars, unlike previous classifications.

We address the critical need for accurate Rosseland mean gas opacities in high-pressure environments, spanning temperatures from 100 K to 32,000 K. Current opacity tables from Wichita State University and ÆSOPUS2.0 are limited to , where in units of . This is insufficient for modeling very low-mass stars, brown dwarfs, and planets with atmospheres exhibiting higher densities and pressures ( ). Leveraging extensive databases such as ExoMol, ExoMolOP, MoLLIST, and HITEMP, we focus on expanding the ÆSOPUS opacity calculations to cover a broad range of pressure and density conditions ( ). We incorporate the thermal Doppler mechanism and microturbulence velocity. Pressure-broadening effects on molecular transitions, leading to Lorentzian or Voigt profiles, are explored in the context of atmospheric profiles for exoplanets, brown dwarfs, and low-mass stars. We also delve into the impact of electron degeneracy and nonideal effects, such as ionization potential depression under high-density conditions, emphasizing its notable influence on Rosseland mean opacities at temperatures exceeding 10,000 K. As a result, this study expands the ÆSOPUS public web interface for customized gas chemical mixtures, promoting flexibility in opacity calculations based on specific research needs. Additionally, precomputed opacity tables, inclusive of condensates, are provided. We present a preliminary application to evolutionary models for very low-mass stars.

We present our analysis of MAXI J1813−095 during its hard state “stalled” outburst in 2018. This self-consistent analysis has been carried out using the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer, Swift, Chandra, and NuSTAR throughout seven observations of MAXI J1813−095. We find a relativistic iron line at ∼6.5 keV from the inner region of the accretion disk. Our results are consistent with a slightly truncated disk or nontruncated disk for an inner radius of ∼2Rg and minimum spin of >0.7 with the best value of ∼0.9, assuming Rin reaches the innermost stable circular orbit at Lx ∼ 1% LEdd. We analyzed MAXI J1813−095 over its outburst, employing a spectral model that self-consistently couples the seed disk photons to the Comptonization and reflection components, also inclusive of reflection Comptonization. The unique aspect of this work is a reflection fraction of order unity, which is significantly higher than previous studies of this source and is a consequence of applying the self-consistent disk-Comptonization-reflection spectral model. Other key parameters, such as inclination and inner radius, are found to be consistent with other works.

研究团队对矮椭圆星系的暗物质晕进行了分析，并讨论了宇宙学和演化方面的影响。他们通过轨道建模，获得了密度斜率和球化程度，并发现“锥心-核心”矛盾较小。矮椭圆星系的暗物质晕中心斜率略低于理论预测，但测量得到的球化程度仍比宇宙学模拟预测的更加圆形。与更明亮的早期星系不同，矮椭圆星系的总密度斜率较浅，且其暗物质密度与亮度的关系不符合预期。矮椭圆星系的暗物质密度和斜率与环境和角动量密切相关。此外，研究结果还表明，矮椭圆星系的晕具有一定的不确定性，且只受到内部反馈的轻微影响。总的来说，矮椭圆星系在局部宇宙组装的红移较高，星系的形成和暗物质晕的组装有很大差异，这表明目前不会有新的矮椭圆星系形成。 <br /><br />总结: 暗物质晕的密度斜率略低于理论预测，矮椭圆星系的球化程度较宇宙学模拟预测的更加圆形；矮椭圆星系的暗物质密度与亮度的关系不符合预期；矮椭圆星系的暗物质密度和斜率与环境和角动量密切相关；矮椭圆星系的暗物质晕受到内部反馈的轻微影响；矮椭圆星系在局部宇宙组装的红移较高，星系的形成和暗物质晕的组装有很大差异。 <div>
We analyze the dark matter (DM) halos of a sample of dwarf ellipticals (dEs) and discuss cosmological and evolutionary implications. Using orbit modeling, we recover their density slopes and, for the first time, halo flattening. We find that the “cusp-core” tension is mild; on average, dEs have central slopes slightly below the Navarro–Frenk–White predictions. However, the measured flattenings are still more spherical than cosmological simulations predict. Unlike brighter early-type galaxies, the total density slopes of dEs are shallower, and their average DM density does not follow their scaling relation with luminosity. Conversely, dE halos are denser and the densities steeper than in late-type galaxies. We find average DM density and slope are strongly correlated with the environment and moderately with the angular momentum. Central, nonrotating dEs have dense and cuspy halos, whereas rotating dEs in Virgo’s outskirts are more cored and less dense. This can be explained by a delayed formation of the dEs in the cluster outskirts, or alternatively by the accumulated baryonic feedback that the dEs in the outskirts have experienced during their very different star formation history. Our results suggest halo profiles are not universal (they depend on assembly conditions) and they evolve only mildly due to internal feedback. We conclude dEs in the local Universe have assembled at a higher redshift than local spirals. In these extreme conditions, star formation and halo assembly, for example, were very different, suggesting no new dEs are formed at present.

<div> dEs, Virgo cluster, kinematic moments, star formation, stellar structure
总结: 
该研究分析了居住在维珍星系团中不同环境中的矮椭圆星系（dEs）的恒星结构。研究利用高光谱分辨率的积分场观测，确定了它们的低速度离散度（约25 km s−1）和半光半径处更高阶的动力学时刻。研究发现，dEs在年龄上表现出多样性，年轻的dEs的金属丰度比年老的低，这表明最近进入维珍星系团的dEs的恒星形成历史复杂，而另一些星系在复电离后不久就被抑制了恒星形成。轨道叠加建模允许恢复视角、恒星质量-光度比（带梯度）以及固有轨道结构。研究发现，与普通早期星系相比，dEs的角动量受到强烈抑制，并且与环境相关。扁平的dEs是因为其垂直于赤道面的动能被抑制。结合人口和动力学建模结果，我们发现了一个年龄相关的恒星初始质量函数，或者证据表明对于那些初始质量较高和/或居住在较低密度环境中的星系，它们的星形成历史更加延续。dEs似乎具有空间均匀的恒星结构，但它们停止形成恒星时所处的状态根据其初始条件在很大程度上会发生显著变化。<br /><br /> <div>
We analyze the stellar structure of a sample of dwarf ellipticals (dEs) inhabiting various environments within the Virgo cluster. Integral-field observations with a high spectral resolution allow us to robustly determine their low-velocity dispersions (∼25 km s−1) and higher-order kinematic moments out to the half-light radius. We find the dEs exhibit a diversity in ages, with the younger dEs being less enhanced than the older, suggesting a complex star formation history for those dEs that recently entered Virgo, while others have been quenched shortly after reionization. Orbit-superposition modeling allowed us to recover viewing angles, stellar mass-to-light ratios (with gradients), as well as the intrinsic orbit structure. We find that the angular momentum of the dEs is strongly suppressed compared to ordinary early-type galaxies and correlates with the environment. Flattened dEs are so because of a suppressed kinetic energy perpendicular to their equatorial plane. Combining population and dynamical modeling results, we find an age-dependent stellar initial mass function or, alternatively, evidence for a more extended star formation history for those galaxies that have had higher initial mass and/or inhabited lower-density environments. dEs appear to have a spatially homogeneous stellar structure, but the state they were “frozen” in as they stopped forming stars varies dramatically according to their initial conditions.

<div> TDE, AT2022lri, X-ray data, super-Eddington accretion flow, ionized outflows
<br /><br />总结:
本文报告了TDE事件AT2022lri，该事件发生在一个距离我们约144Mpc的一颗低质量的大质量黑洞（104M⊙ < MBH < 106M⊙）的准静态星系中。通过NICER，Swift和XMM-Newton收集了超过1Ms的X射线数据，发现X射线的亮度从峰值187到672天之间逐渐下降，但仍远高于紫外线和光学亮度，与正面观察到的超艾丁顿吸积流一致。还观察到不规则的强X射线波动，变化时间尺度约为0.5小时至1天，振幅约为2-8。在对时间分辨光谱进行分析后，显示X射线波动与内部盘温度的下降相关，并需要次相对论（0.1-0.3c）的离子外流存在。研究者提出，盘温度波动可能源于磁不稳定性或内部吸积盘沿着黑洞自旋轴的摇摆。 <div>
We present the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2022lri, hosted in a nearby (≈144 Mpc) quiescent galaxy with a low-mass massive black hole (104M⊙ < MBH < 106M⊙). AT2022lri belongs to the TDE-H+He subtype. More than 1 Ms of X-ray data were collected with NICER, Swift, and XMM-Newton from 187 to 672 days after peak. The X-ray luminosity gradually declined from 1.5 × 1044 erg s−1 to 1.5 × 1043 erg s−1 and remains much above the UV and optical luminosity, consistent with a super-Eddington accretion flow viewed face-on. Sporadic strong X-ray dips atop a long-term decline are observed, with a variability timescale of ≈0.5 hr–1 days and amplitude of ≈2–8. When fitted with simple continuum models, the X-ray spectrum is dominated by a thermal disk component with inner temperature going from ∼146 to ∼86 eV. However, there are residual features that peak around 1 keV, which, in some cases, cannot be reproduced by a single broad emission line. We analyzed a subset of time-resolved spectra with two physically motivated models describing a scenario either where ionized absorbers contribute extra absorption and emission lines or where disk reflection plays an important role. Both models provide good and statistically comparable fits, show that the X-ray dips are correlated with drops in the inner disk temperature, and require the existence of subrelativistic (0.1–0.3c) ionized outflows. We propose that the disk temperature fluctuation stems from episodic drops of the mass accretion rate triggered by magnetic instabilities or/and wobbling of the inner accretion disk along the black hole’s spin axis.

在这篇论文中，研究团队使用James Webb太空望远镜对宇宙再电离时期的一个类星体进行了深入研究。他们发现了类星体的黑洞质量和辐射能量，并观测到了类星体产生的高速气体流出现象。这个高速气体流的动力学特性与低红移下的类星体产生的气体流特性相似。研究还指出，这个气体流可能会对母系星系的恒星形成产生影响，可能从内部地区驱逐出大量气体。这些发现表明，这个气体流产生的动能与类星体的辐射能量大致相当，符合模型对负反馈所需的能量范围。总结: <br /><br />以上发现揭示了早期宇宙恒星系的演化过程，尤其是关于类星体产生的气体流对恒星系内气体和星系形成的影响，这对我们理解宇宙尺度的恒星系统的形成和演化过程有重要意义。 <div>
The James Webb Space Telescope opens a new window to directly probe luminous quasars powered by billion solar mass black holes in the Epoch of Reionization and their coevolution with massive galaxies with unprecedented details. In this paper, we report the first results from a deep NIRSpec integral field unit spectroscopic study of a quasar at z = 7.5. We obtain a bolometric luminosity of ∼1.8 × 1047 erg s−1 and a black hole mass of ∼0.7–2.5 × 109M⊙ based on the Hβ emission line in the quasar spectrum. We discover ∼2 kpc scale, highly blueshifted (∼−870 km s−1) and broad (∼1400 km s−1) [O iii] line emission after the quasar point-spread function has been subtracted. Such line emission most likely originates from a fast, quasar-driven outflow, the earliest one at galactic scales known so far. The dynamical properties of this outflow fall within the typical ranges of quasar-driven outflows at lower redshift, and the outflow may be fast enough to reach the circumgalactic medium. Combining both the extended and nuclear outflow together, the mass outflow rate, ∼300 M⊙ yr−1, is ∼60%–380% of the star formation rate of the quasar host galaxy, suggesting that the outflow may expel a significant amount of gas from the inner region of the galaxy. The kinetic energy outflow rate, ∼3.6 × 1044 erg s−1, is ∼0.2% of the quasar bolometric luminosity, which is comparable to the minimum value required for negative feedback based on simulation predictions. The dynamical timescale of the extended outflow is ∼1.7 Myr, consistent with the typical quasar lifetime in this era.

Gravitational-wave (GW) detectors are observing compact object mergers from increasingly far distances, revealing the redshift evolution of the binary black hole (BBH)—and soon the black hole–neutron star (BHNS) and binary neutron star (BNS)—merger rate. To help interpret these observations, we investigate the expected redshift evolution of the compact object merger rate from the isolated binary evolution channel. We present a publicly available catalog of compact object mergers and their accompanying cosmological merger rates from population synthesis simulations conducted with the COMPAS software. To explore the impact of uncertainties in stellar and binary evolution, our simulations use two-parameter grids of binary evolution models that vary the common-envelope efficiency with mass transfer accretion efficiency and supernova (SN) remnant mass prescription with SN natal kick velocity, respectively. We quantify the redshift evolution of our simulated merger rates using the local (z ∼ 0) rate, the redshift at which the merger rate peaks, and the normalized differential rates (as a proxy for slope). We find that although the local rates span a range of ∼103 across our model variations, their redshift evolutions are remarkably similar for BBHs, BHNSs, and BNSs, with differentials typically within a factor 3 and peaks of z ≈ 1.2–2.4 across models. Furthermore, several trends in our simulated rates are correlated with the model parameters we explore. We conclude that future observations of the redshift evolution of the compact object merger rate can help constrain binary models for stellar evolution and GW formation channels.

Narrow emission lines in a galaxy’s spectrum that show double peaks indicate the presence of distinct gas components with different velocities, and its physical origin remains uncertain. This study uses galaxies from the final MaNGA data release to detect double-peaked narrow emission-line spaxels (DPSs) by examining the double Gaussian profiles of the Hα-[N ii] doublets across all MaNGA spaxels. A total of 5420 DPSs associated with 304 double-peaked narrow emission-line galaxies (DPGs) are identified, with each DPG containing a minimum of five DPSs and being free from overlap with other galaxies. We find that DPSs can be categorized into three groups according to their central distance r/Re and the velocity difference Δv between their two components: the inner low-Δv, inner high-Δv, and outer DPSs. By incorporating the physical characteristics of the DPGs into their DPSs, we demonstrate for the first time the existence of statistical correlations between barred DPGs and inner low-Δv DPSs, AGN-hosting DPGs, and inner high-Δv DPSs, as well as tidal DPGs and outer DPSs.

通过使用Illustris TNG300水动力学模拟数据，研究了星系、暗物质晕及它们的大尺度环境之间的联系。从子暗物质晕的属性中预测星体质量，测试了两种机器学习（ML）模型：可解释的增强机器（EBM）和不变图神经网络（GNN）。最佳表现的EBM模型利用了3Mpc尺度上的球对称平均过密特征。通过SHapley添加解释，表明在TNG300星系-暗物质晕联系的背景下，简单的3Mpc尺度球对称过密比使用DisPerSE算法测量的宇宙网距离特征更重要。与此同时，以固定链接长度定义连接性的GNN在表现上显著优于EBM模型。随着链接长度尺度的增加，GNN能够学习到直到我们探测到的最大尺度的重要环境贡献（L = 10 Mpc）。我们得出结论，3Mpc距离尺度对于描述使用球对称过密参数化的TNG星系-暗物质晕联系至关重要，但是无法被简单的环境参数或宇宙网特征捕捉到的更大尺度的信息可以进一步增强这些模型。我们的研究突出了使用可解释的机器学习算法解释天体现象模型的好处，以及使用GNN从数据中灵活学习复杂关系并施加物理对称性的能力。

We investigate the connection between galaxies, dark matter halos, and their large-scale environments at z = 0 with Illustris TNG300 hydrodynamic simulation data. We predict stellar masses from subhalo properties to test two types of machine learning (ML) models: explainable boosting machines (EBMs) with simple galaxy environment features and -invariant graph neural networks (GNNs). The best-performing EBM models leverage spherically averaged overdensity features on 3 Mpc scales. Interpretations via SHapley Additive exPlanations also suggest that in the context of the TNG300 galaxy–halo connection, simple spherical overdensity on ∼3 Mpc scales is more important than cosmic web distance features measured using the DisPerSE algorithm. Meanwhile, a GNN with connectivity defined by a fixed linking length, L, outperforms the EBM models by a significant margin. As we increase the linking length scale, GNNs learn important environmental contributions up to the largest scales we probe (L = 10 Mpc). We conclude that 3 Mpc distance scales are most critical for describing the TNG galaxy–halo connection using the spherical overdensity parameterization, but that information on larger scales, which is not captured by simple environmental parameters or cosmic web features, can further augment these models. Our study highlights the benefits of using interpretable ML algorithms to explain models of astrophysical phenomena, and the power of using GNNs to flexibly learn complex relationships directly from data while imposing constraints from physical symmetries.

The electromagnetic emission and the afterglow observations of the binary neutron star merger event GW170817A confirmed the association of the merger with a short gamma-ray burst (GRB) harboring a narrow (5°–10°) and powerful (1049–1050 erg) jet. Using the 1 s long neutrino-radiation general relativistic MHD simulation of coalescing neutron stars of K. Kiuchi et al., and following the semi-analytical estimates of M. Pais et al., we inject a narrow, powerful, unmagnetized jet into the post-merger phase. We explore different opening angles, luminosities, central engine durations, and times after the merger. We explore early (0.1 s following the merger) and late (1 s) jet launches; the latter is consistent with the time delay of ≈1.74 s observed between GW170817 and GRB 170817A. We demonstrate that the semi-analytical estimates correctly predict the jets’ breakout and collimation conditions. When comparing our synthetic afterglow light curves to the observed radio data of GW170807, we find a good agreement for a 3 × 1049 erg jet launched late with an opening angle in the range ≃5°–7°.

X-rays have significant impacts on cold, weakly ionized protoplanetary disks by increasing the ionization rate and driving chemical reactions. Stellar flares are explosions that emit intense X-rays and are the unique source of hard X-rays with an energy of ≳10 keV in the protoplanetary disk systems. Hard X-rays should be carefully taken into account in models as they can reach the disk midplane as a result of scattering in the disk atmospheres. However, previous models are insufficient to predict the hard X-ray spectra because of simplifications in flare models. We develop a model of X-ray spectra of stellar flares based on observations and flare theories. The flare temperature and nonthermal electron emissions are modeled as functions of flare energy, which allows us to better predict the hard X-ray photon flux than before. Using our X-ray model, we conduct radiative transfer calculations to investigate the impact of flare hard X-rays on disk ionization, with a particular focus on the protoplanetary disk around a T Tauri star. We demonstrate that for a flare with an energy of 1035 erg, X-ray photons with ≳5 keV increase the ionization rates more than galactic cosmic rays down to z ≈ 0.1R. The contribution of flare X-rays to the ionization at the midplane depends on the disk parameters such as disk mass and dust settling. We also find that the 10 yr averaged X-rays from multiple flares could certainly contribute to the ionization. These results emphasize the importance of stellar flares on the disk evolution.

总结:<br />
本研究使用COMPAS进行了群体综合模拟，发现孤立双黑洞、黑洞-中子星和双中子星合并率与尺度SFRD存在显著偏差。这种偏差主要是由于低金属丰度条件下形成双黑洞的效率比太阳金属丰度条件下高一个数量级，以及双黑洞形成和合并之间存在着广泛的延迟时间。此外，我们还发现双黑洞的延迟时间分布随红移变化，增加了合并时的红移分布的复杂性。这些结果表明来自孤立渠道的双黑洞、黑洞-中子星和双中子星合并率可能明显偏离尺度SFRD，未来的合并率测量将对引力波源的形成途径提供进一步洞察。 <div>
Gravitational-wave detectors are now making it possible to investigate how the merger rate of binary black holes (BBHs) evolves with redshift. In this study, we examine whether the BBH merger rate of isolated binaries deviates from a scaled star formation rate density (SFRD)—a frequently used model in state-of-the-art research. To address this question, we conduct population synthesis simulations using COMPAS with a grid of stellar evolution models, calculate their cosmological merger rates, and compare them to a scaled SFRD. We find that our simulated rates deviate by factors up to 3.5 at z ∼ 0 and 5 at z ∼ 9 due to two main phenomena: (i) the formation efficiency of BBHs is an order of magnitude higher at low metallicities than at solar metallicity, and (ii) BBHs experience a wide range of delays (from a few megayears to many gigayears) between formation and merger. The deviations are similar when comparing to a delayed SFRD, and even larger (up to ∼10×) when comparing to SFRD-based models scaled to the local merger rate. Interestingly, our simulations find that the BBH delay time distribution is redshift dependent, increasing the complexity of the redshift distribution of mergers. We find similar results for simulated merger rates of black hole–neutron stars (BHNSs) and binary neutron stars (BNSs). We conclude that the rate of BBH, BHNS, and BNS mergers from the isolated channel can significantly deviate from a scaled SFRD, and that future measurements of the merger rate will provide insights into the formation pathways of gravitational-wave sources.

总结: 这篇文章讨论了中等质量黑洞（IMBH）在侏儒星系中的动力学和演化。研究发现，在非核心侏儒星系中，IMBH之间的融合速度较慢，尽管具有极高的偏心率。这表明在非核心侏儒星系中，低密度的星际环境不足以推动IMBH二进制系统融合。这些发现强调了需要考虑宿主特性才能准确预测LISA所观测到的IMBH融合速率。 <div>
Intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) mergers with masses 104–106M⊙ are expected to produce gravitational waves detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) with high signal-to-noise ratios from the present day to cosmic dawn. IMBH mergers are expected to take place within dwarf galaxies; however, the dynamics, timescales, and effect on their hosts are largely unexplored. In a previous study, we examined how IMBHs would pair and merge within nucleated dwarf galaxies. IMBHs in nucleated hosts evolve very efficiently, forming a binary system and coalescing within a few hundred million years. Although the fraction of dwarf galaxies (107M⊙ ≤ M⋆ ≤ 1010M⊙) hosting nuclear star clusters is between 60% and 100%, this fraction drops to 20%–70% for lower-mass dwarfs (M⋆ ≈ 107M⊙), with the largest drop in low-density environments. Here, we extend our previous study by performing direct N-body simulations to explore the dynamics and evolution of IMBHs within nonnucleated dwarf galaxies, under the assumption that IMBHs exist within these dwarfs. To our surprise, none of the IMBHs in our simulation suite merge within a Hubble time, despite many attaining high eccentricities e ∼ 0.7–0.95. We conclude that extremely low stellar density environments in the centers of nonnucleated dwarfs do not provide an ample supply of stars to interact with an IMBH binary, resulting in its stalling, in spite of triaxiality and high eccentricity, common means to drive a binary to coalescence. Our findings underline the importance of considering all detailed host properties to predict IMBH merger rates for LISA.

总结: 通过使用非局部热力学平衡反演和瑞典反演码，研究了太阳色球区域的声波能量通量和辐射损失之间的平衡。利用干涉双向光谱仪和接触区域成像光谱仪的光谱观测数据，自洽地推导了大气不同高度处的速度功率谱和冷却速率。研究结果表明，在拟合这些光谱线时，反演可能低估了色球各个高度处的声波通量，同时略微高估了辐射损失。然而，即使考虑了这些偏差，声波通量与辐射损失的比值在大多数观测区域仍然低于1，特别是在色球的较高层。此外，我们还观察到在斑区，磁场倾斜角与低色球的辐射损失之间存在相关性，这表明磁场拓扑在色球损失中起着一定作用。 <div>
Accurately assessing the balance between acoustic wave energy fluxes and radiative losses is critical for understanding how the solar chromosphere is thermally regulated. We investigate the energy balance in the chromosphere by comparing deposited acoustic flux and radiative losses under quiet and active solar conditions using non–local thermodynamic equilibrium inversions with the Stockholm Inversion Code. To achieve this, we utilize spectroscopic observations from the Interferometric BIdimensional Spectrometer in the Na i 5896 Å and Ca ii 8542 Å lines and from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph in the Mg ii h and k lines to self-consistently derive spatially resolved velocity power spectra and cooling rates across different heights in the atmosphere. Additionally, we use snapshots of a three-dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamics simulation to investigate the systematic effects of the inversion approach, particularly the effect of attenuation on the velocity power spectra and the determination of the cooling rates. The results indicate that inversions potentially underestimate acoustic fluxes at all chromospheric heights while slightly overestimating the radiative losses when fitting these spectral lines. However, even after accounting for these biases, the ratio of acoustic flux to radiative losses remains below unity in most observed regions, particularly in the higher layers of the chromosphere. We also observe a correlation between the magnetic field inclination in the photosphere and radiative losses in the low chromosphere in plage, which is evidence that the field topology plays a role in the chromospheric losses.

Data from the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) are analyzed from 1996 to 2023 to investigate tilt angles (γ) of bipolar magnetic regions and Joy’s law for Solar Cycles 23 and 24 and a portion of Cycle 25. The HMI radial magnetic field (Br) and MDI magnetogram (Blos) data are used to calculate (γ) using the flux-weighted centroids of the positive and negative polarities. Each active region (AR) is only sampled once. The analysis includes only Beta (β)-class ARs since computing γ of complex ARs is less meaningful. During the emergence of the ARs, we find that the average tilt angle ( ) increases from 3.°30 ± 0.75 when 20% of the flux has emerged to 6.°79° ± 0.66 when the ARs are at their maximum flux. Cycle 24 has a larger average tilt, =6.67 ± 0.66, than Cycle 23, = 5.11 ± 0.61. No significant difference is found in the slope of Joy’s law or when sampling the ARs at the time of maximum flux or central meridian crossing. There are persistent differences in in the hemispheres, with the Sun's southern hemisphere having higher in Cycles 23 and 24, but the uncertainties are such that these differences are not statistically significant.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章采用两点相关函数作为统计工具，对IllustrisTNG模拟中不同宇宙红移下不同宿主暗物质晕体积质量范围内星系的空间聚类进行了量化。研究发现，空间聚类强度与星系形成红移之间存在明显相关性，且随着宿主暗物质晕质量的增加而减弱。对于更庞大的星系系统，它们在较晚的时间进行组装，新加入的恒星会增加聚类现象。此外，更庞大暗物质晕中的卫星星系轨道表现出更大的径向各向异性，反映了其宿主暗物质晕更活跃的吞并状态以及更高的质量损失速率。 <div>
We adopt the two-point correlation function (2PCF) as a statistical tool to quantify the spatial clustering of halo stars for galaxy systems spanning a wide range in host halo virial mass ( ) and redshifts (0 < z < 1.5) from the IllustrisTNG simulations. Consistent with a previous study, we identify clear correlations between the strength of the 2PCF signals and galaxy formation redshifts, but over a much wider mass range. We find that such correlations are slightly stronger at higher redshifts and get weakened with the increase of host halo mass. We demonstrate that the spatial clustering of halo stars is affected by two factors: (1) the clustering gets gradually weakened as time passes (phase mixing); (2) newly accreted stars at more recent times would increase the clustering. For more massive galaxy systems, they assemble late, and the newly accreted stars would increase the clustering. The late assembly of massive systems may also help to explain the weaker correlations between the 2PCF signals and the galaxy formation redshifts in massive halos, as their 2PCFs are affected more by recently accreted stars, while formation redshift characterizes mass accretion on a much longer timescale. We find that the orbits of satellite galaxies in more massive halos maintain larger radial anisotropy, reflecting the more active accretion state of their hosts while also contributing to their stronger mass loss rates.

<br />
太阳活跃区NOAA Active Region 11861的耀斑活动的观测结果显示，在接口区成像光谱仪（IRIS）的远紫外通道中可以观测到分子氢（H2）的丰富光谱发射线。通过比较使用1D建模的H2荧光产生的合成光谱，确定了37条新的发射线。为了避免误认H2线，还从先前研究中编制了IRIS FUV波段的完整原子线鉴定清单。我们对耀斑期间发生的H2发射进行了空间分辨分析，得出了以下结论：（1）在空间分辨观测中，H2线比可能显示出光学厚线形成，与先前的结果相反；（2）H2多普勒速度的空间分布与从其他物种测量的速度相比，表明H2远程探测探测了大气的中间深度，介于光球和色球之间，与建模的预期一致；（3）H2线强度与其激发源的观测强度之间的关系与大气成层有关；（4）H2荧光有时会对来自太阳表面许多兆米之外的远源辐射作出反应。

A rich spectrum of molecular hydrogen (H2) emission lines is seen in sensitive observations from the far-ultraviolet (FUV) channels of the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) during flare activity in solar active region NOAA Active Region 11861. Based on this observation, we have determined 37 new line identifications by comparing synthetic spectra produced using 1D modeling of H2 fluorescence. To avoid misidentification of the H2 lines, we have also compiled a complete list of atomic line identifications for the IRIS FUV bandpasses from previous work. We carry out analysis of the spatially resolved H2 emission that occurs during the flares and find the following: (1) in spatially resolved observations the H2 line ratios may show optically thick line formation, contrary to previous results; (2) comparison of the spatial distribution of H2 Doppler velocities with those measured from other species reveals that H2 remote sensing probes an intermediate depth in the atmosphere between the photosphere and chromosphere, consistent with expectations from modeling; (3) the relationship between H2 line intensity and the observed intensity of its exciter is related to the atmospheric stratification; however, (4) H2 fluorescence can sometimes occur in response to radiation from distant sources many megameters away across the solar surface.

Sub-ion-scale magnetic holes (MHs) are ubiquitous structures in plasmas across a wide range of environments. Despite previous observational and modeling efforts, the three-dimensional (3D) electric field in MHs has yet to be adequately resolved. In this study, utilizing high-resolution measurements of an MH (∼0.08ρi × 0.14ρi) from the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission in Earth’s turbulent magnetosheath, we report this 3D electric field and unveil its roles and generation mechanism. A model is established to quantify the impacts of E∥ on increasing the loss cone of trapped electrons. The electric field is attributed to electron convection and pressure gradient terms of generalized Ohm’s law. The MH, primarily coupling to the electron, is accompanied by electron jets. These electron jets can be interpreted as different segments of an electron vortex. These electron jets combined with nonideal electric fields not only lead to strong energy conversion (j · (E + ve × B) ∼ 40 nW m−3) from the electromagnetic field to electrons but also enable energy conversion between different electron motion directions. Our study significantly clarifies the physical image of kinetic-scale MHs.

We present a survey of 1D kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of quasi-parallel nonrelativistic shocks to identify the environments favorable for electron acceleration. We explore an unprecedented range of shock speeds vsh ≈ 0.067–0.267c, Alfvén Mach numbers , sonic Mach numbers , as well as the proton-to-electron mass ratios mi/me = 16–1836. We find that high Alfvén Mach number shocks can channel a large fraction of their kinetic energy into nonthermal particles, self-sustaining magnetic turbulence and acceleration to larger and larger energies. The fraction of injected particles is ≲0.5% for electrons and ≈1% for protons, and the corresponding energy efficiencies are ≲2% and ≈10%, respectively. The extent of the nonthermal tail is sensitive to the Alfvén Mach number; when , the nonthermal electron distribution exhibits minimal growth beyond the average momentum of the downstream thermal protons, independently of the proton-to-electron mass ratio. Acceleration is slow for shocks with low sonic Mach numbers, yet nonthermal electrons still achieve momenta exceeding the downstream thermal proton momentum when the shock Alfvén Mach number is large enough. We provide simulation-based parameterizations of the transition from thermal to nonthermal distribution in the downstream (found at a momentum around ), as well as the ratio of nonthermal electron to proton number density. The results are applicable to many different environments and are important for modeling shock-powered nonthermal radiation.

The origin of high-energy galactic cosmic rays is yet to be understood, but some galactic cosmic-ray accelerators can accelerate cosmic rays up to PeV energies. The high-energy cosmic rays are expected to interact with the surrounding material or radiation, resulting in the production of gamma-rays and neutrinos. To optimize for the detection of such associated production of gamma-rays and neutrinos for a given source morphology and spectrum, a multimessenger analysis that combines gamma-rays and neutrinos is required. In this study, we use the Multi-Mission Maximum Likelihood framework with IceCube Maximum Likelihood Analysis software and HAWC Accelerated Likelihood to search for a correlation between 22 known gamma-ray sources from the third HAWC gamma-ray catalog and 14 yr of IceCube track-like data. No significant neutrino emission from the direction of the HAWC sources was found. We report the best-fit gamma-ray model and 90% CL neutrino flux limit from the 22 sources. From the neutrino flux limit, we conclude that, for five of the sources, the gamma-ray emission observed by HAWC cannot be produced purely from hadronic interactions. We report the limit for the fraction of gamma-rays produced by hadronic interactions for these five sources.

<br /><br />总结:
本文讨论了太阳辐射对气候的影响，特别是在太阳活动异常低的时期。文章利用半经验模型重建了过去一千年的太阳辐射记录，发现在 Spörer 最低期（约1400年）和 Maunder 最低期（1645年至1715年）出现了辐射值下降的情况。这为我们更全面地了解太阳对气候的影响提供了重要数据。 <div>
Solar irradiance variations across various timescales, from minutes to centuries, represent a potential natural driver of past regional and global climate cold phases. To accurately assess the Sun’s effect on climate, particularly during periods of exceptionally low solar activity, known as grand minima, an accurate reconstruction of solar forcing is essential. While direct measurements of the total solar irradiance (TSI) only began in the late 1970s, with the advent of space radiometers, indirect evidence from various historical proxies suggests that the Sun’s magnetic activity has undergone possible significant fluctuations over much longer timescales. Employing diverse and independent methods for TSI reconstruction is essential to gaining a comprehensive understanding of this issue. This study employs a semi-empirical model to reconstruct TSI over the past millennium. Our approach uses an estimated open solar magnetic field (Fo), derived from cosmogenic isotope data, as a proxy for solar activity. We reconstruct the cyclic variations of TSI, due to the solar surface magnetic features, by correlating Fo with the parameter of active region functional form. We obtain the long-term TSI trend by applying the empirical mode decomposition algorithm to the reconstructed Fo to filter out the 11 yr and 22 yr solar variability. We prepare a reconstructed TSI record, spanning 971 to 2020 CE. The estimated departure from modern TSI values occurred during the Spörer minimum (around 1400 CE), with a decrease of approximately 2.3 Wm−2. A slightly smaller decline of 2.2 Wm−2 is reported during the Maunder minimum, between 1645 and 1715 CE.

总结:
我们使用来自Solar Dynamics Observatory和Solar and Heliospheric Observatory的数据，选择并研究了六次全球太阳极端紫外波事件。这些喷发都位于太阳边缘，但被记录为日冕质量抛射（CME）所驱动的震荡扩展到了相反的一侧。通过使用边缘观测避免了投影效应，我们测量了EUV波前从1.05到1.25 R⊙的倾斜度和速度。我们还调查了EUV波前与CME边界以及CME驱动的冲击波之间的耦合和联系。在这六个事件中的主要发现包括：（1）主要和日冕孔传播的EUV波前的前倾角估计，并研究了这些倾斜的起源及其对实际波前速度估计的影响；（2）环系统在日冕基部附近可以提高波前速度，在低日冕的平均速度与高日冕中CME驱动的冲击波的横向扩展之间没有明显的相关性；（3）波前的快磁音马赫数从日冕基部就大于1；（4）EUV波前在两个事件中在传播过程中与CME驱动始终耦合；（5）在EUV波前消失后，CME驱动的冲击波在相反的一侧继续传播，并在四个事件中与EUV波前断开联系。这些结果及其影响进行了讨论，这些结果有助于深入了解全球EUV波的特性。 <div>
We select and investigate six global solar extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave events using data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. These eruptions are all on the limb but recorded as halo coronal mass ejections (CMEs) because the CME-driven shocks have expanded laterally to the opposite side. With the limb observations avoiding the projection effect, we have measured the inclination and speed of the EUV wavefront from 1.05 to 1.25 R⊙. We also investigate the coupling and connection of the EUV wavefront with the CME boundary and the CME-driven shock, respectively. The major findings in the six events are: (1) the forward inclination of the primary and coronal-hole-transmitted EUV wavefronts is estimated, respectively, and the origins of these inclinations and their effects on the estimate of actual wavefronts speed are investigated; (2) the wavefront speed can be elevated by loop systems near the coronal base, and the average speed in the low corona has no clear correlation with the lateral expansion of the CME-driven shock in the high corona; (3) the fast magnetosonic Mach number of the wavefront is larger than unity from the coronal base; (4) the EUV wavefront is coupled with the CME driver throughout the propagation in two events; (5) after the EUV wavefront vanishes, the CME-driven shock continues traveling on the opposite side and disconnects from the EUV wavefront in four events. These results and their implications are discussed, which provide insight into the properties of global EUV waves.

总结:
本研究使用三维全球混合模拟来研究太阳风磁场、火星壳磁场和行星捕获离子对火星磁尾的扭曲影响。结果表明，火星壳磁场会使火星磁尾产生逆时针或顺时针扭曲，取决于太阳风磁场在火星日心坐标系中的Y分量的符号。但是，当火星壳磁场在夜侧时，扭曲更为明显，这与早期解释不同，早期解释认为火星壳磁场通过白天磁重连接影响扭曲。另外，行星捕获离子也对扭曲起作用，因为它们的质量装载减慢了等离子体流动，并导致磁场线在磁尾弯曲。研究表明，在火星阴影内的近磁尾区域（在X=-1.5RM，其中RM为火星半径），扭曲主要归因于壳磁场，而在火星阴影外和离火星较远的区域，行星捕获离子的影响开始占主导地位。 <div>
Three-dimensional global hybrid simulations are performed to explore how the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), the Martian crustal fields, and planetary pickup ions affect the twisting of the Martian magnetotail. The results agree with previous studies that the crustal magnetic fields cause the Martian magnetotail to twist counterclockwise or clockwise depending on the sign of the IMF Y-component in the Mars solar orbital coordinates. However, the twist is more pronounced when the crustal fields are on the nightside, contradicting the early explanation that the crustal fields affect the twist through dayside magnetic reconnection between the crustal fields and the draped IMF. Additionally, planetary pickup ions also contribute to the twist because their mass loading slows down the plasma flow and leads to the bending of the magnetic field lines in the magnetotail. It is demonstrated that the twist inside Mars’ shadow in the near magnetotail region (at X = −1.5 RM, where RM is Mars’ radius) is mainly attributable to the crustal fields, while the influence of planetary pickup ions starts to dominate outside Mars’ shadow and in regions further away from Mars.

Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can grow through both accretion and mergers. It is still unclear how SMBHs evolve under these two channels from high redshifts to the SMBH population we observe in the local Universe. Observations can directly constrain the accretion channel but cannot effectively constrain mergers yet, while cosmological simulations provide galaxy merger information but can hardly return accretion properties consistent with observations. In this work, we combine the observed accretion channel and the simulated merger channel, taking advantage of observations and cosmological simulations, to depict a realistic evolution pattern of the SMBH population. With this methodology, we can derive the scaling relation between the black hole mass (MBH) and host-galaxy stellar mass (M⋆), and the local black hole mass function (BHMF). Our scaling relation is lower than those based on dynamically measured MBH, supporting the claim that dynamically measured SMBH samples may be biased. We show that the scaling relation has little redshift evolution. The BHMF steadily increases from z = 4 to z = 1 and remains largely unchanged from z = 1 to z = 0. The overall SMBH growth is generally dominated by the accretion channel, with possible exceptions at high mass (MBH ≳ 108M⊙ or M⋆ ≳ 1011M⊙) and low redshift (z ≲ 1). We also predict that around 25% of the total SMBH mass budget in the local Universe may be locked within long-lived, wandering SMBHs, and the wandering mass fraction and wandering SMBH counts increase with M⋆.

总结: 
研究表明，投射在原行星盘上的阴影可以使其变得偏心。恒星辐射在这些盘的大部分区域都占主导地位，因此不均匀的照射可以产生有趣的动力学效应。研究着重于过渡盘。作者进行了3D Athena++模拟，使用恒定的热松弛时间来描述盘对变化恒星照射的响应。发现不对称的阴影扰动了径向压力梯度，并将流体流线扭曲成一组扭曲的椭圆。这些流线之间的相互作用产生了一系列后果。对于窄环，不对称的阴影可以急剧截断其内边缘，可能解释了一些盘中观察到的陡峭密度下降，并避免了对大量扰动体的需要。对于宽环，这样的阴影可以将其拆分为两个（或可能更多）偏心环。这些环不断对彼此施加扭矩，并以健康的速率驱动气体吸积，甚至在没有盘粘度的情况下也是如此。此类扭曲的偏心环的特征可能已经被观察到，例如在气体空腔内的扭曲速度图中。我们主张进行更有针对性的观测，并更好地理解这些阴影的起源。 <div>
We demonstrate that shadows cast on a protoplanetary disk can drive it eccentric. Stellar irradiation dominates heating across much of these disks, so an uneven illumination can have interesting dynamical effects. Here, we focus on transition disks. We carry out 3D Athena++ simulations, using a constant thermal relaxation time to describe the disk’s response to changing stellar illumination. We find that an asymmetric shadow, a feature commonly observed in real disks, perturbs the radial pressure gradient and distorts the fluid streamlines into a set of twisted ellipses. Interactions between these streamlines have a range of consequences. For a narrow ring, an asymmetric shadow can sharply truncate its inner edge, possibly explaining the steep density drop-offs observed in some disks and obviating the need for massive perturbers. For a wide ring, such a shadow can dismantle it into two (or possibly more) eccentric rings. These rings continuously exert torque on each other and drive gas accretion at a healthy rate, even in the absence of disk viscosity. Signatures of such twisted eccentric rings may have already been observed as, e.g., twisted velocity maps inside gas cavities. We advocate for more targeted observations and for a better understanding on the origin of such shadows.

总结: 本研究是首次提出了Chandra X射线天文台（CXO）所发现的“脉冲星X射线丝状结构”或“不对齐的流出”。这些线性的同步辐射特征由超相对论电子和正电子提供能源，并逃离脉冲星的弓形冲击波。通过均匀的方法提取了五个确定的丝状结构和三个候选者的光谱拟合和形态特性。在档案CXO数据的搜索中，找到了一些已知的例子，并识别了一些额外的弱候选者。还报告了对具有类似产生丝状结构的脉冲星的快照CXO ACIS调查，没有发现新的丝状结构，但发现了一些弥漫辐射，包括一个PWN尾迹。最后，根据这些新观测结果，提供了一个关于产生丝状结构所需的脉冲星属性的更新模型。 <div>
We present the first Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) catalog of “pulsar X-ray filaments,” or “misaligned outflows.” These are linear, synchrotron-radiating features powered by ultrarelativistic electrons and positrons that escape from bow shock pulsars. The filaments are misaligned with the (large) pulsar velocity, distinguishing them from the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) trail, which is also often visible in CXO ACIS images. Spectral fits and morphological properties are extracted for five secure filaments and three candidates using a uniform method. We present a search of archival CXO data for linear diffuse features; the known examples are recovered and a few additional weak candidates are identified. We also report on a snapshot CXO ACIS survey of pulsars with properties similar to the filament producers, finding no new filaments but some diffuse emission, including one PWN trail. Finally, we provide an updated model for the pulsar properties required to create filaments in light of these new observations.

总结: 
通过SOFIA上的EXES仪器，我们对银河系中三个天体的分子气体进行了研究，包括IC 443的超新星遗迹、NGC 2071的中等质量星形成区域中的原恒星外流和3C 391的超新星遗迹。该研究旨在寻找C型冲击中正-反H2跃迁之间预期的速度差。与此前对HH7的类似研究不同，我们的搜索结果为阴性，未能可靠地检测到速度差。文章讨论了这种差异缺失的几种可能解释，包括预冲击正-反H2比已接近高温平衡值3（在IC 443C的情况下）、所有这些源中表现出的更复杂的冲击结构，以及观测中相对于HH7观测的更大的投影孔径尺寸。 <br /><br /> <div>
Using the EXES instrument on SOFIA, we have obtained velocity-resolved spectra of several pure rotational lines of H2 toward shocked molecular gas within three Galactic sources: the supernova remnant (SNR) IC 443 (clump C), a protostellar outflow in the intermediate-mass star-forming region NGC 2071, and the SNR 3C 391. These observations had the goal of searching for expected velocity shifts between ortho- and para-H2 transitions emitted by C-type shocks. In contrast in our previous similar study of HH7, the result of our search was negative: no velocity shifts were reliably detected. Several possible explanations for the absence of such shifts are discussed: these include a preshock ortho-to-para ratio that is already close to the high-temperature equilibrium value of 3 (in the case of IC 443C), the more complex shock structures evident in all these sources, and the larger projected aperture sizes relative to those in the observations of HH7.

<div> 高精度观测，TIC 400562821，脉动行为，三个频率，高振幅δ Scuti星，非线性响应，振幅变化，稳定振幅，径向恒星脉动建模，恒星演化

总结:<br /><br />本研究使用高精度TESS观测探究了TIC 400562821的脉动行为，发现其为三模式高振幅δ Scuti星，振幅变化稳定。径向恒星脉动建模表明，虽然F模式振幅保持恒定，但F1逐渐减小，F2接近于零，暗示TIC 400562821可能最终演化为单模式HADS星。此外，通过测定αMLT和非绝热等参数，推测TIC 400562821可能处于主序星后阶段，但仍需进一步研究确认其性质。 <div>
We investigated the pulsating behavior of TIC 400562821 using high-precision observations from TESS. Fourier analysis of time-series data revealed three independent frequencies. The period ratios of F to F1 (0.774) and F to F2 (0.625), along with an amplitude change of approximately 0.1 mag, indicate that TIC 400562821 is a triple-mode High-Amplitude δ Scuti (HADS) star. Using the Best Parent Method and the ΓO functions, we identified that the harmonics and sum combination frequencies of F and F1 are caused by the nonlinear response of the stellar medium to pulsation. We also analyzed the amplitude variations of F, F1, and F2. Observational data over 76 days show stable amplitudes for these modes. However, Radial Stellar Pulsations modeling suggests that, over 10,000 cycles, the amplitude of F remains constant, while F1 gradually decreases and F2 approaches zero. This implies that TIC 400562821 may eventually evolve into a single-mode HADS star. Furthermore, asteroseismic modeling was performed, and several effects, such as the mixing-length parameter αMLT and nonadiabatic, were examined on this star. In view of the results by Daszyńska-Daszkiewicz et al. (i.e., αMLT < ∼1 for δ Scuti stars), TIC 400562821 is suggested to be more likely in the post-main-sequence stage, with mass M = 1.34–1.38 M⊙ and metallicity Z = 0.007–0.008, but still warrants further study to ascertain its nature.

该研究利用了来自DESI的最新BAO数据，结合了Dark Energy Survey的SN数据和Planck卫星的CMB数据，探索了暗能量和暗物质之间的潜在相互作用。结果表明，暗能量和暗物质之间的相互作用在一定程度上得到支持，特别是对于暗能量向暗物质衰变的情况。此外，研究发现，不同类型的IDE模型对于当前观测数据的解释能力不同，这有助于澄清哪种类型的IDE模型可以更好地解释当前的观测数据。 <div>
The recent results from the first-year baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data released by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernova (SN) data, have shown a detection of significant deviation from a cosmological constant for dark energy. In this work, we utilize the latest DESI BAO data in combination with the SN data from the full 5 yr observations of the Dark Energy Survey and the CMB data from the Planck satellite to explore potential interactions between dark energy and dark matter. We consider four typical forms of the interaction term Q. Our findings suggest that interacting dark energy (IDE) models with Q ∝ ρde support the presence of an interaction where dark energy decays into dark matter. Specifically, the deviation from ΛCDM for the IDE model with Q = βH0ρde reaches the 3σ level. These models yield a lower value of Akaike information criterion than the ΛCDM model, indicating a preference for these IDE models based on the current observational data. For IDE models with Q ∝ ρc, the existence of interaction depends on the form of the proportionality coefficient Γ. The IDE model with Q = βHρc yields β = 0.0003 ± 0.0011, which essentially does not support the presence of the interaction. In general, whether the observational data support the existence of interaction is closely related to the model. Our analysis helps to elucidate which type of IDE model can better explain the current observational data.

总结:<br />
TianQin提出利用激光干涉测量来检测引力波信号，但激光传播效应可能引入潜在噪声因素。研究使用磁流体动力学模拟来获得极强太阳耀斑期间的空间磁场和等离子体分布，并基于模拟结果，调查了TianQin项目的激光传播噪声。对于极强太阳耀斑事件，发现激光传播噪声接近于Michelson组合的100%位移噪声要求，而对于时间延迟干涉法（TDI）-X组合，激光传播噪声仍然约为TianQin位移噪声要求的30%。另外，研究了12个不同太阳风条件下的激光传播噪声。发现激光传播噪声与一些太空天气参数（如太阳风动压、Sym-H和Dst）呈线性相关，其中太阳风动压的相关系数最强。整合1999年至2021年太阳风动压的累积分布和太阳风动压与激光传播噪声的线性相关，确定Michelson组合在整个太阳活动周内发生激光传播噪声超过TianQin要求30%以上的发生率约为15%。此外，发现TDI可以抑制激光传播噪声，并将激光传播噪声超过TianQin要求的发生率减少至1%以下。 <div>
TianQin (TQ) proposes to detect gravitational-wave signals by using laser interferometry. However, the laser propagation effect introduces a potential noise factor for TQ. In this work, we used magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to obtain the space magnetic field and plasma distributions during an extremely strong solar eruption, and based on the MHD simulation result, we investigated laser propagation noise for TQ. For the extremely strong solar eruption event, we find that the laser propagation noise closely approaches 100% of TQ’s displacement noise requirement for the Michelson combination, while the laser propagation noise is still about 30% of TQ’s displacement noise requirement for time-delay interferometry (TDI)-X combination. In addition, we investigate the laser propagation noise for 12 cases with different solar wind conditions. Our finding reveals a linear correlation between the laser propagation noise and several space weather parameters, e.g., solar wind dynamic pressure, Sym-H, and Dst, where the correlation coefficients for solar wind dynamic pressure are strongest. Combining the cumulative distribution of solar wind dynamic pressure from 1999 to 2021 with the linear correlation between solar wind dynamic pressure and laser propagation noise, we have determined that the occurrence rate of the laser propagation noise to be greater than 30% of TQ’s displacement noise requirement for the Michelson combination over the entire solar activity week is about 15%. In addition, we find that TDI can suppress the laser propagation noise, and reduce the occurrence rate of the laser propagation noise exceeding 30% of TQ’s requirement to less than 1%.

总结：<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了行星和恒星质量黑洞在盘状星系中的角动量交换和迁移过程。研究发现，盘状星系中的行星/黑洞会与盘内气体进行角动量交换，导致其迁移方向发生变化。研究使用了二维全局流体动力学模拟，考虑了重力、压力、粘性等因素对行星/黑洞和盘内气体之间的角动量交换。当行星/黑洞处于不断吸积状态时，发现由盘内气体向行星/黑洞传递的正角动量导致其发生外迁。此外，研究还发现在全局稳态条件下，质量和角动量通量在盘中是恒定的，除了在行星/黑洞位置会出现跳跃，这些跳跃与行星/黑洞的吸积率和力矩相匹配。因此，文章建议在应用盘中迁移标准结果到不断吸积的行星和黑洞时需要谨慎。 <div>
Nascent planets are thought to lose angular momentum (AM) to the gaseous protoplanetary disk via gravitational interactions, leading to inward migration. A similar migration process also applies to stellar-mass black holes (BHs) embedded in the disks of active galactic nuclei. However, AM exchange via accretion onto the planet/BH may strongly influence the migration torque. In this study, we perform 2D global hydrodynamic simulations of an accreting planet/BH embedded in a disk, where AM exchange between the planet/BH and disk via gravity, accretion, pressure, and viscosity are considered. When accretion is turned off, we recover the linear estimate for Type I migration torque. However, for the two planet masses we investigated with our accreting simulations, we find outward migration due to the positive AM deposited onto the accreting body by the disk gas. Our simulations achieve the global steady state for the transport of mass and AM: The mass and AM fluxes are constant across the disk except for jumps ( and ) at the planet’s location, and the jumps match the accretion rate and torque on the planet. Our findings suggest that caution is needed when applying the standard results of disk migration to accreting planets and BHs.

Strong gravitational lenses are a singular probe of the Universe’s small-scale structure—they are sensitive to the gravitational effects of low-mass (<1010M⊙) halos even without a luminous counterpart. Recent strong-lensing analyses of dark matter structure rely on simulation-based inference (SBI). Modern SBI methods, which leverage neural networks as density estimators, have shown promise in extracting the halo-population signal. However, it is unclear whether the constraints from these models are limited by the methodology or the data. In this study, we introduce an accelerator-optimized simulation pipeline that can generate lens images with realistic subhalo populations in milliseconds. Leveraging this simulator, we identify the main limitation of our fiducial SBI analysis: training set size. We then adopt a sequential neural posterior estimation (SNPE) approach, allowing us to refine the training distribution to align with the observed data. Using only one-fifth as many mock Hubble Space Telescope images, SNPE matches the constraints on the low-mass halo population produced by our best nonsequential model. Our experiments suggest that an over 3 order-of-magnitude increase in training set size and GPU hours would be required to achieve an equivalent result without sequential methods. While the full potential of the existing lens sample remains to be explored, the notable improvement in constraining power enabled by our sequential approach highlights that current constraints are limited primarily by methodology and not the data itself. Moreover, our results emphasize the need to treat training set generation and model optimization as interconnected stages of any cosmological analysis using SBI.

Dense cores inherit turbulent motions from the interstellar medium in which they form. As a tool for comparison to both simulations and observations, it is valuable to construct theoretical core models that can relate their internal density and velocity structure while predicting their stability to gravitational collapse. To this end, we solve the angle-averaged equations of hydrodynamics under two assumptions: (1) the system is in a quasi-steady equilibrium; (2) the velocity field consists of radial bulk motion plus isotropic turbulence, with turbulent dispersion increasing as a power law in the radius. The resulting turbulent equilibrium sphere (TES) solutions form a two-parameter family, characterized by the sonic radius rs and the power-law index p. The TES is equivalent to a Bonnor–Ebert (BE) sphere when rs → ∞ . The density profile in the outer regions of the TES is slightly shallower than the BE sphere, but is steeper than the logotropic model. Stability analysis shows that the TESs with size exceeding a certain critical radius are unstable to radial perturbations. The center-to-edge density contrast, mass, and radius of the marginally stable TES all increase with increasing average velocity dispersion. The FWHM of the column density profile is always smaller than the critical radius, by a larger factor at higher velocity dispersion, suggesting that observations need to probe beyond the FWHM to capture the full extent of turbulent cores. When applied to the highly turbulent regime typical of cluster-forming clumps, the critical mass and radius of the TES intriguingly resembles the typical mass and radius of observed star clusters.

The Synthetic Corona Outflow Model (SynCOM), an empirical model, simulates the solar corona’s dynamics to match high-resolution observations, providing a useful resource for testing velocity measurement algorithms. SynCOM generates synthetic images depicting radial variability in total brightness and includes stochastic elements for plasma outflows and instrumental noise. It employs a predefined probability distribution for flow velocity and an adjustable signal-to-noise ratio to evaluate different data analysis methods for coronal flows. By adjusting parameters to match specific coronal and instrumental conditions, SynCOM offers a platform to assess these methods for determining coronal velocity and acceleration. Validating these measurements would help us to understand the origins of the solar wind and support missions such as the Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere (PUNCH). In this study, we demonstrate how SynCOM can be employed to assess the precision and performance of two different flow-tracking methods. By providing a ground truth based on observational data, we highlight the importance of SynCOM in confirming observational standards for detecting coronal flows.

总结: 通过Gaia XP光谱学，我们发现银河系中极端富含金属的恒星主要集中在一个紧凑的“节点”处，这个节点在投影上是圆形的，在RGC，proj约1.5千秒巴附近有一个相当明显的边缘，是一个动力学上活跃的系统。银河系中富含金属的节点也包含了非常金属丰富的恒星。然而，与EMR恒星不同，大部分VMR恒星形成了内部银河系中扁平分布。我们利用TNG50模拟来进行比较，发现紧凑、富含金属的节点限制在大约1.5千秒巴内是一个普遍的特征。在我们的银河系数据中，最富含金属的恒星仅占0.1%。需要进行穿透尘埃的广域近红外光谱观测，如第五次斯隆数字天文学调查，才能对银河系EMR节点中恒星的比例进行严格估计。值得解释的是，为什么在我们的银河系中，只有EMR巨星被限制在这样一个中心节点。值得注意的是，银河系中心几千秒巴的范围内既有最集中的贫金属恒星（“贫穷的老心脏”），也几乎包含所有富含金属的恒星。这突显了在银河系重力势阱底部的恒星种群多样性。 <br /> <div>
We show with Gaia XP spectroscopy that extremely metal-rich (EMR) stars in the Milky Way ([M/H]XP ≳ 0.5) are largely confined to a tight “knot” at the center of the Galaxy. This EMR knot is round in projection, has a fairly abrupt edge near RGC,proj ∼ 1.5 kpc, and is a dynamically hot system. This central knot also contains very metal-rich (VMR; +0.2 ≤ [M/H]XP ≤ +0.4) stars. However, in contrast to EMR stars, the bulk of VMR stars forms an extended, highly flattened distribution in the inner Galaxy (RGC ≲ 5 kpc). We draw on TNG50 simulations of Milky Way analogs for context and find that compact, metal-rich knots confined to ≲1.5 kpc are a universal feature. In typical simulated analogs, the top 5%–10% most metal-rich stars are confined to a central knot; however, in our Milky Way data this fraction is only 0.1%. Dust-penetrating wide-area near-infrared spectroscopy, such as the fifth Sloan Digital Sky Survey, will be needed for a rigorous estimate of the fraction of stars in the Galactic EMR knot. Why in our Milky Way only EMR giants are confined to such a central knot remains to be explained. Remarkably, the central few kiloparsecs of the Milky Way harbor both the highest concentration of metal-poor stars (the “poor old heart”) and almost all EMR stars. This highlights the stellar population diversity at the bottom of galactic potential wells.

<div> Gaia DR3, Galactic disk structure, wave pattern, perturbations, bar<br /> <br />总结:<br />银河系盘结构的动态过程对于重建银河系的进化历史至关重要。最新的Gaia DR3数据显示，在LZ−〈VR〉空间中出现了一种新的波动模式，但它的形成机制仍然不清楚。通过利用最新的Gaia DR3数据，我们发现LZ−〈VR〉波动会随着动力学热量更大、JZ值更大的恒星而系统性地向更低的LZ偏移。我们进行了三组测试粒子模拟以区分不同扰动因素的作用。结果显示LZ−〈VR〉波更可能是内部起源的。此外，将ΔLZ峰值与2:1 OLR相联系提供了一种约束银河系棒的转动速度的新方法，支持了长/慢棒模型。 <div>
Decoding the key dynamical processes that shape the Galactic disk structure is crucial for reconstructing the Milky Way’s evolution history. The second Gaia data release unveils a novel wave pattern in the LZ−〈VR〉 space, but its formation mechanism remains elusive due to the intricate nature of involved perturbations and the challenges in disentangling their effects. Utilizing the latest Gaia DR3 data, we find that the LZ−〈VR〉 wave systematically shifts toward lower LZ for dynamically hotter stars with larger JZ values. The amplitude of this phase shift between stars of different dynamical hotness (ΔLZ) peaks at around 2100 km s−1 kpc. To differentiate the role of different perturbations, we perform three sets of test particle simulations, wherein a satellite galaxy, transient spiral arms, and a bar plus the transient spiral arms act as the sole perturber, respectively. Under the satellite impact, the phase shift amplitude ΔLZ decreases toward higher LZ, which we interpret through a toy model of radial phase mixing. While neither the transient spiral arms nor the bar generates an azimuthally universal phase shift variation pattern, combining the bar and spirals generates a characteristic ΔLZ peak at the 2:1 outer Lindblad resonance (OLR) of the bar, qualitatively resembling the observed feature. Therefore, the LZ−〈VR〉 wave is more likely of internal origin. Furthermore, linking the ΔLZ peak to the 2:1 OLR offers a novel approach to constraining the pattern speed of the Galactic bar, supporting the long/slow bar model.

总结：<br /><br />本研究使用多流体模型模拟了高β质子-电子等离子体中平行质子飞鞭不稳定性的演化和饱和过程，无需添加人工粘性。研究发现，在所有物种中允许压力各向异性发展时，电子对平行质子飞鞭不稳定性的饱和有显著影响，调节了不稳定性饱和时的质子压力各向异性。即使对于与太阳圈等离子体更相关的较低β值，使用梯度松弛闭合的模拟中也观察到了明显的电子能量化现象。我们的研究结果表明，解决电子压力各向异性对于正确描述多种物种等离子体系统的行为是重要的。 <div>
Instabilities driven by pressure anisotropy play a critical role in modulating the energy transfer in space and astrophysical plasmas. For the first time, we simulate the evolution and saturation of the parallel proton firehose instability using a multifluid model without adding artificial viscosity. These simulations are performed using a 10-moment, multifluid model with local and gradient relaxation heat-flux closures in high-β proton–electron plasmas. When these higher-order moments are included and pressure anisotropy is permitted to develop in all species, we find that the electrons have a significant impact on the saturation of the parallel proton firehose instability, modulating the proton pressure anisotropy as the instability saturates. Even for lower β's more relevant to heliospheric plasmas, we observe a pronounced electron energization in simulations using the gradient relaxation closure. Our results indicate that resolving the electron pressure anisotropy is important to correctly describe the behavior of multispecies plasma systems.

总结:<br />
本文利用Hinode/EUV成像光谱仪获取的数据，对18个日冕环进行分析，得出加热分布随着加热规模高度朝向日冕环顶部递减，加热速率在过渡区高度为E0 = 10^(-2.0±0.5) erg cm^(-3) s^(-1)，并估计得到加热流量FH = 10^(7.0±0.4) erg cm^(-2) s^(-1)。研究发现使用成像数据会导致对电子密度和E0、FH的低估，最终得出重连加热模型是最合理的结论。 <div>
Heating distributions along coronal loops are obtained from spectroscopic data with the Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer. The loop half-lengths Lhalf are in the range of 24–107 Mm for our analysis of 18 loops. By using the analytical approximations to 1D hydrostatic numerical calculations of electron temperature Te(s) and density distributions ne(s) along a loop, the heating distribution that decreases with a heating scale height sH toward the loop top with a heating rate E0 at the height of the transition region is estimated by applying a Bayesian analysis to the observed Te(s) and ne(s) derived by emission line ratios. We obtain sH = 10 ± 4 Mm increasing with Lhalf, E0 = 10−2.0±0.5 erg cm−3 s−1 decreasing with Lhalf, and the heating flux FH = 107.0±0.4 erg cm−2 s−1. These loops show sH/Lhalf = 0.21 ± 0.07, suggesting the concentration of the heating near the lower part. Compared to the previous study using imaging data, sH is comparable, while E0 and FH are about an order of magnitude larger. We find that using the imaging data leads to the underestimation of the electron density and consequently the underestimation of E0 and FH. We examine heating mechanisms using the power-law relation for FH, the field strength Bbase and Lhalf: . We find and , which show that the reconnection heating model is the most plausible.

Knowledge of the global magnetic field distribution and its evolution on the Sun’s surface is crucial for modeling the coronal magnetic field, understanding the solar wind dynamics, computing the heliospheric open flux distribution, and predicting the solar cycle strength. As the far side of the Sun cannot be observed directly and high-latitude observations always suffer from projection effects, we often rely on surface flux transport (SFT) simulations to model the long-term global magnetic field distribution. Meridional circulation, the large-scale north–south component of the surface flow profile, is one of the key components of the SFT simulation that requires further constraints near high latitudes. Prediction of the photospheric magnetic field distribution requires knowledge of the flow profile in the future, which demands reconstruction of that same flow at the current time so that it can be estimated at a later time. By performing Observing System Simulation Experiments, we demonstrate how the ensemble Kalman filter technique, when used with an SFT model, can be utilized to make “posterior” estimates of flow profiles into the future that can be used to drive the model forward to forecast the photospheric magnetic field distribution.

总结: 
本研究利用多平面光线追踪算法和IllustrisTNG 100-3宇宙学模拟来研究大尺度结构引起的宇宙学透镜效应。研究发现，宇宙剪切的分布是高斯分布，而宇宙收敛的分布呈现偏斜，接近对数正态分布。位移的高阶项具有显著的离散度。这些结果表明，大尺度结构引起的视线位移效应可能会显著影响透镜模型，因此不应忽略。这些结果有助于未来的集群透镜模型的建立。 <br /><br /> <div>
Interpreting and reconstructing distant sources that are gravitationally lensed by galaxy clusters requires accurate and precise lens models. While high-quality data sets have reduced statistical errors in such models, systematic errors remain important. We examine systematic lensing effects caused by density fluctuations due to large-scale structure along the line of sight. We use a multiplane ray-tracing algorithm with the IllustrisTNG 100-3 cosmological simulation of matter distribution and compute the statistical distributions of shear, convergence, and higher-order deflections using two Hubble Frontier Field clusters as examples (A2744 and MACS J0416.1−2403). The cosmic shear distribution is Gaussian in each component, while the cosmic convergence distribution is skewed such that 1 + κ is consistent with a log-normal distribution; the standard deviations for these quantities are at the level of a few to 10%, depending on the redshift of the source. The deflection from higher-order terms beyond convergence and shear has significant scatter: the rms deflection is ∼15″, considerably larger than the image position residuals for current lens models. These results indicate that line-of-sight deflection effects due to large-scale structure can significantly impact lens models and should not be neglected. We present results in forms that can be incorporated into future cluster lens models.

<div> 关键词: 快速射电暴（FRB），磁星，O模式，X模式，等离子体冲击<br />
<br />
本研究调查了在磁星附近发出的快速射电爆发（FRB）是如何通过其周围的偶极磁层（r = 10^7–10^9厘米）传播的。首先，我们显示出在O模式下发射的GHz射电暴，只有沿着磁轴方向有一个狭窄的锥形区域是不会被立即衰减的。然后，我们研究了X模式下的射电暴。在靠近磁赤道附近传播的GHz波将表现为磁流体力学波，如果它们的能量远远大于10^40erg/s。这些波将在每次振荡中形成等离子体冲击并在厘米尺度处耗散。具有较低能量或者传播方向更接近磁轴的波不服从磁流体力学规律，而是与单个粒子相互作用，并需要动力学描述。动力学相互作用会迅速将粒子加速到洛伦兹因子为10^4–10^5，这将以波能量为代价，最终导致波的强烈衰减。在任一传播范围内，无论是磁流体力学还是动力学，包围FRB源的偶极磁层都会作为吸收射电暴并在X射线中重新辐射吸收能量的枕头。这些结果限制了观测到的FRB的起源。我们认为观测到的FRB之所以避免衰减，是因为它们是由磁星爆发产生的相对论外流所发出的，因此GHz波不需要通过包围磁星的外部平衡磁层传播。 <br /><br />总结: 这项研究揭示了快速射电爆发在磁星周围磁层中的传播行为，并指出了观测到的FRB避免衰减的可能原因。 <div>
We investigate how a fast radio burst (FRB) emitted near a magnetar would propagate through its surrounding dipole magnetosphere at radii r = 107–109 cm. First, we show that a GHz burst emitted in the O-mode with luminosity L ≫ 1040 erg s−1 is immediately damped for all propagation directions except a narrow cone along the magnetic axis. Then, we examine bursts in the X-mode. GHz waves propagating near the magnetic equator behave as magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves if they have L ≫ 1040 erg s−1. The waves develop plasma shocks in each oscillation and dissipate at cm. Waves with lower L or propagation directions closer to the magnetic axis do not obey MHD. Instead, they interact with individual particles and require a kinetic description. The kinetic interaction quickly accelerates particles to Lorentz factors 104–105 at the expense of the wave energy, which again results in strong damping of the wave. In either propagation regime, MHD or kinetic, the dipole magnetosphere surrounding the FRB source acts as a pillow absorbing the radio burst and reradiating the absorbed energy in X-rays. These results constrain the origin of observed FRBs. We argue that the observed FRBs avoid damping because they are emitted by relativistic outflows from magnetospheric explosions, so that the GHz waves do not need to propagate through the outer equilibrium magnetosphere surrounding the magnetar.

Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can be ejected from their galactic centers due to gravitational wave recoil or the slingshot mechanism following a galaxy merger. If an ejected SMBH retains its inner accretion disk, it may be visible as an off-nuclear active galactic nucleus (AGN). At present, only a handful of offset AGNs that are recoil or slingshot candidates have been found, and none have been robustly confirmed. Compiling a large sample of runaway SMBHs would enable us to constrain the mass and spin evolution of binary SMBHs and study feedback effects of displaced AGNs. We adapt the method of varstrometry—which was developed for Gaia observations to identify off-center, dual, and lensed AGNs—in order to quickly identify off-nuclear AGNs in optical survey data by looking for an excess of blue versus red astrometric jitter. We apply this to the Pan-STARRS1 3π Survey and report on five new runaway AGN candidates. We focus on ZTF18aajyzfv: a luminous quasar offset by 6.7 ± 0.2 kpc from an adjacent galaxy at z = 0.224, and conclude after Keck LRIS spectroscopy and comparison to ASTRID simulation analogs that it is likely a dual AGN. This selection method can be easily adapted to work with data from the soon-to-be commissioned Vera C. Rubin Telescope Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). LSST will have a higher cadence and deeper magnitude limit than Pan-STARRS1, and should permit detection of many more runaway SMBH candidates.

总结:<br /><br />
本研究利用James Webb Space Telescope的成功性能推进了我们对宇宙再离子化时期的理解。通过合成不同红移下的观测数据，我们发现星系计数和视星等基于紫外线光度函数，其中包括红移依赖的星体形成效率（SFE）和对尘埃衰减的修正。进一步的分析显示，汤姆逊散射光学深度为某值，再离子化始于某红移，结束于某红移，而这并不受UV光度函数截断等选择的影响。通过结合其他数据集和一些合理的限制，我们发现物质扰动的振幅为σ8 = 0.80 ± 0.05，与标准ΛCDM模型一致。未来的星系调查和星系演化的动力学模拟将打破SFE和宇宙学参数之间的退化，进一步提高UV光度函数模型的准确性和精度。 <div>
Thanks to the successful performance of the James Webb Space Telescope, our understanding of the epoch of reionization of the Universe has been advanced. The ultraviolet luminosity functions (UV LFs) of galaxies span a wide range of redshifts, not only revealing the connection between galaxies and dark matter (DM) halos but also providing information during reionization. In this work, we develop a model connecting galaxy counts and apparent magnitude based on UV LFs, which incorporates redshift-dependent star formation efficiency (SFE) and corrections for dust attenuation. By synthesizing some observations across the redshift range of 4 ≤ z ≤ 10 from various galaxy surveys, we discern the evolving SFE with increasing redshift and DM halo mass through model fitting. Subsequent analyses indicate that the Thomson scattering optical depth was and the epoch of reionization started (ended) at ( ), which is insensitive to the choice of the truncated magnitude of the UV LFs. Incorporating additional data sets and some reasonable constraints, the amplitude of matter perturbation is found to be σ8 = 0.80 ± 0.05, which is consistent with the standard ΛCDM model. Future galaxy surveys and the dynamical simulations of galaxy evolution will break the degeneracy between SFE and cosmological parameters, improving the accuracy and the precision of the UV LF model further.

The dust grain size distribution (GSD) likely varies significantly across star-forming environments in the Universe, but its impact on star formation remains unclear. This ambiguity arises because the GSD interacts nonlinearly with processes like heating, cooling, radiation, and chemistry, which have competing effects and varying environmental dependencies. Processes such as grain coagulation, expected to be efficient in dense star-forming regions, reduce the abundance of small grains and increase that of larger grains. Motivated by this, we investigate the effects of similar GSD variations on the thermochemistry and evolution of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) using magnetohydrodynamic simulations spanning a range of cloud masses and grain sizes, which explicitly incorporate the dynamics of dust grains within the full-physics framework of the STARFORGE project. We find that grain size variations significantly alter GMC thermochemistry: the leading-order effect is that larger grains, under fixed dust mass, GSD dynamic range, and dust-to-gas ratio, result in lower dust opacities. This reduced opacity permits interstellar radiation field and internal radiation photons to penetrate more deeply. This leads to rapid gas heating and inhibited star formation. Star formation efficiency is highly sensitive to grain size, with an order-of-magnitude reduction when grain size dynamic range increases from 10−3–0.1 μm to 0.1–10 μm. Additionally, warmer gas suppresses low-mass star formation, and decreased opacities result in a greater proportion of gas in diffuse ionized structures.

We present progress on the translational tomography technique for measuring the three-dimensional structure of the corona from near-perihelion Wide-field Imager for Parker Solar Probe (WISPR) image sequences. Translational tomography makes use of noncircular motion of a camera to extract three-dimensional information from an optically thin subject. Parker Solar Probe (PSP) presents a special case both because of the particular structure of the corona and because of the nonlinear motion of the vantage point. We show improvements to a previous direct analytic method (described in Paper I of this series) and an alternative inversion pathway using a synthetic sequence of WISPR images. The newer method successfully reconstructs the correct locations of modeled coronal rays in a synthetic WISPR image sequence, with curvilinear camera motion modeled on the PSP orbit. We present the refined methodology and validation study, and show that the technique is ready for application to actual WISPR data.

Satellite observations in the Earth’s magnetosphere suggest a coexistence of different types of ion populations, such as protons and heavier helium ions (alpha particles) transported by the solar wind. We have undertaken an investigation, from first principles, of the conditions for the occurrence of electrostatic solitary waves in such a multi-ion plasma environment. Nonlinear analysis has been employed to explore the effect of an ion beam on the occurrence of stopbands in a multicomponent plasma consisting of Boltzmann electrons and two ion species, modeled as cold and warm (adiabatic) ions. A “stopband” is an interval of pulse speed (mach (Mach number) values in which solitary waves cannot propagate. Such stopbands are known to exist in relation to fast ion-acoustic solitary waves (exclusively). Our parametric analysis reveals that the stopband widens over the range of cold ion charge density (values) upon increasing speed of a hot ion beam moving along the direction of wave propagation. However, the stopband becomes narrower in the case of a counterpropagating beam. Similarly, the streaming of a cold ion beam fluid along (or antiparallel) to the wave direction leads to the narrowing (or widening, respectively) of the stopband. The fast soliton existence (velocity) domain is characterized by two critical points (a crossover and a turning point), which are affected by the beam. Our study could be relevant to understanding energy dissipation processes in the fast solar wind associated with relative drifts between the major (protons) and minor (alpha particles) ions which results in the heating of both species.

<div> 关键词: Cygnus Loop, core-collapse supernova, point-symmetrical morphology, jittering jets explosion mechanism, CCSNe

总结:
Cygnus Loop是一个核心坍缩超新星遗迹，通过分析不同的发射波段图像，发现其具有点对称形态，由三对喷流塑造而成。主要的喷流轴呈S形，被称为S形软管，其它两条线连接着一个突起和中心对面的孔洞，这些结构在X射线、紫外、可见光、红外和/或无线电图像中都有体现。Cygnus Loop的点对称形态符合核心坍缩超新星爆炸机制的预期，这个机制认为数对随机方向变化的喷流引发了星体的爆炸。这项研究进一步支持了这一机制作为核心坍缩超新星的主要爆炸机制。 <div>
Analyzing images of the Cygnus Loop, a core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant, in different emission bands, we identify a point-symmetrical morphology composed of three symmetry axes that we attribute to shaping by three pairs of jets. The main jet axis has an elongated S shape, appearing as a faint narrow zone in visible and UV. We term it the S-shaped hose, and the structure of three symmetry lines the point-symmetric wind rose. The two other lines connect a protrusion (an ear or a bulge) with a hole on the opposite side of the center (a nozzle or a cavity), structures that we identify in the X-ray, UV, visible, IR, and/or radio images. There is a well-known blowout at the southern end of the S-shaped hose, and we identify a possible opposite blowout at the northern end of the S-shaped hose. The point-symmetrical morphology of the Cygnus Loop is according to the expectation of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) of CCSNe, where several to few tens of pairs of jets with stochastically varying directions explode the star. The three pairs of jets that shaped the wind-rose structure of the Cygnus Loop are the last energetic pairs of this series of jets. Our study further supports the JJEM as the main explosion mechanism of CCSNe.

<div> threads, displacement, intensity oscillations, quiescent prominence, New Vacuum Solar Telescope

总结：<br /><br />本文使用New Vacuum Solar Telescope观测到的日冕静态日珥中心Hα线上的数据，对日珥中的线索位移和强度振荡进行了研究。通过对观测数据的分析，发现了35条在线状结构，其中29条线索展示出位移振荡，平均周期为26分钟；另有8条线索展示出强度振荡，平均周期为7.7分钟；而7条线索同时表现出了位移和强度的振荡。此外，通过对线索不同位置进行分析，发现线索的振荡很可能是一种驻波，但也可能是一种长波传播波。这些发现有助于我们更深入地理解太阳上的复杂动态过程。 <div>
In this paper, we investigate the thread displacement and intensity oscillations in a quiescent prominence observed by New Vacuum Solar Telescope at the Hα line center on 2019 October 31. Each individual thread is traced by the local maximum intensity among its width at various times. In total, 35 threads are detected at six heights parallel to the solar surface. We find 29/35 threads exhibiting the displacement oscillation. A sinusoidal function is used to fit them, and a mean period of 26 minutes is identified. By slicing the same thread at different positions, we find that the oscillation of the thread is very likely a standing wave, but it could also be a long-wavelength propagating wave. After integrating the intensity along the thread width, we also find 8/35 threads presenting their intensity oscillation with a mean period of 7.7 minutes. In total, 7/35 threads exhibit both the displacement and the intensity oscillations.

总结: <br />
本研究利用SDSS的Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey和Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey目录，通过精确的光谱红移估计了由太阳系的固有运动引起的动力红移二极性。结果表明，从动力红移二极性中提取的速度与宇宙微波背景辐射推导的值是一致的。尽管SDSS的天区覆盖范围小且光源数量密度有限，限制了我们获取精确和可靠的测量结果，但我们通过红移二极性方法估计了动力红移二极性。本研究中的速度测量对与光源计数二极性相关的固有聚集效应不敏感。本工作测量的动力红移二极性及其与宇宙微波背景辐射值的一致性并不保证大尺度上的各向同性。天文射电台VLASS调查和广域红外勘测卫星目录测量的各向同性偏差可能是由于星系的固有分布。该研究结果仅关注动力红移二极性项。 <div>
We utilize the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey and Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey catalogs with precise spectroscopic redshifts to estimate the kinematic redshift dipole caused by the proper motion of the solar system. We find that the velocity extracted from the kinematic dipole is consistent with cosmic microwave background (CMB) inferred values. Although the small sky coverage and limited number density of the SDSS sources constrain us from obtaining precise and robust measurements, we leverage the redshift dipole method to estimate the kinematic dipole. The velocity measurements in this study are insensitive to intrinsic clustering, associated with the source count dipole. The kinematic dipole measured in this work and its consistency with CMB values do not guarantee isotropy at large scales. The anisotropy (excess dipole) measured with the NRAO VLA Sky Survey and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer Catalog could be due to the intrinsic distribution of galaxies. The results in this work focus solely on the kinematic dipole term.

<div> 关键词: resonant friction, disk rotation, nuclear star cluster, gravitational perturbation, black hole spins

总结：<br /><br />本文主要讨论了共振摩擦对旋转方向与核心星团不一致的盘状结构的影响。这种盘状结构的重力会对星团造成引力干扰，从而对盘状结构产生强大的扭矩。作者认为这种扭矩可能是银河中心年轻恒星的盘状结构破裂的原因，并通过数值实验证明了这种效应对恒星角动量分布的影响。此外，文章还推测了核心星团的旋转对围绕超大质量黑洞的临时大质量吸积盘的方向和黑洞自旋的稳定效应。 <div>
We argue that resonant friction has a dramatic effect on a disk whose rotation direction is misaligned with that of its host nuclear star cluster. The disk’s gravity causes gravitational perturbation of the cluster that in turn exerts a strong torque back onto the disk. We argue that this torque may be responsible for the observed disruption of the clockwise disk of young stars in the Galactic center, and show in numerical experiments that it produces the observed features in the distribution of the stars’ angular momenta. More generally, we speculate that the rotation of nuclear star clusters has a stabilizing effect on the orientation of transient massive accretion disks around the supermassive black holes residing in their centers, and thus on the directions and magnitudes of the black hole spins.

<title>Synchrotron Polarization of a Hybrid Distribution of Relativistic Thermal and Nonthermal Electrons in Gamma-Ray Burst Prompt Emission</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Synchrotron polarization of relativistic nonthermal electrons in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been widely studied. However, recent numerical simulations of relativistic shocks and magnetic reconnection have found that a more realistic electron distribution consists of a power-law component plus a thermal component, which requires observational validation. In this paper, we investigate synchrotron polarization using a hybrid energy distribution of relativistic thermal and nonthermal electrons within a globally toroidal magnetic field in GRB prompt emission. Our results show that compared to the case of solely nonthermal electrons, the synchrotron polarization degrees (PDs) in these hybrid electrons can vary widely, depending on different parameters, and that the PD decreases progressively with frequency in the gamma-ray, X-ray, and optical bands. The time-averaged PD spectrum displays a significant bump in the gamma-ray and X-ray bands, with the PDs higher than ∼60% if the thermal peak energy of the electrons is much smaller than the conjunctive energy of the electrons between the thermal and nonthermal distributions. The high-synchrotron PDs (≳60%) in the gamma-ray and X-ray bands, which generally cannot be produced by solely nonthermal electrons with typical power-law slopes, can be achieved by hybrid electrons and primarily originates from the exponential decay part of the thermal component. Moreover, this model can roughly explain the PDs and spectral properties of some GRBs, where GRB 110301A with a high PD ( ) may be potential evidence for the existence of relativistic thermal electrons.

<title>Time Variation of the Solar Tachocline</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have used solar oscillation frequencies and frequency splittings obtained over solar cycles 23 and 24 and the rising phase of solar cycle 25 to investigate whether the tachocline properties (the change in the rotation rate across the tachocline. i.e., the jump, the width, and the position) show any time variation. We confirm that the change in rotation rate across the tachocline changes substantially; however, the change does not show a simple correlation with solar cycle unlike, for instance, changes in mode frequencies. The change during the ascending phase of solar cycle 25 is almost a mirror image of the change during the descending part of solar cycle 24, tempting us to speculate that the tachocline has a much longer period than either the sunspot or the magnetic cycle. We also find that the position of the tachocline, defined as the midpoint of the change in rotation rate, showed significant changes during solar cycle 24. The width of the tachocline, on the other hand, has shown significant changes during solar cycle 23 but not later. The change in the tachocline becomes more visible if we look at the upper and lower extents of the tachocline, defined as (position ± width). We find that for epochs around solar maxima and minima, the extent decreases before increasing again—a few more years of data should clarify this trend. Our results reinforce the need to continue helioseismic monitoring of the Sun to understand solar activity and its evolution.

<title>Alleviating H 0 and S 8 Tensions Simultaneously in K-essence Cosmology</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The present work begins by examining the early-Universe inflationary epoch of a special K-essence model, which incorporates a linear coupling term between the scalar field potential and the canonical Lagrangian. For the power-law potential, we both numerically and analytically prove that the inflationary parameters such as the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio are compatible with the recent BICEP/Keck observations. Continuing this work, our analysis based on comparing early-Universe observations with late-Universe measurements indicates that the tension on the Hubble parameter H0 and the growth of structure parameter S8 can be alleviated simultaneously. More precisely, compared to the standard ΛCDM model, our model can reduce H0 tension to roughly 2.2σ, and the S8 discrepancy diminishes to 0.82σ.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Neutron monitors (NMs) are large ground-based detectors of atmospheric secondary particles, mostly neutrons, from primary cosmic rays. Their sky direction and rigidity imply a well-defined incoming (asymptotic) direction in space. From 2015 December 16 to 2017 January 8, 6 of the 18 NM counters had been transferred from McMurdo to Jang Bogo, both in Antarctica, so data from similar detectors were recorded simultaneously at these two nearby NM stations. Autocorrelations of these NM count rates are well fit as the sum of three components: an exponential function and a cosine with a period of 1 day, both centered at zero lag, plus a constant. Fitting the cross correlation of the two count rates, the functions are no longer centered at zero lag. The best-fit cosine phase is at time lag −160.22 ± 0.12 minutes. Calculating cosmic-ray trajectories in Earth's magnetic field throughout the time interval, the mean difference in response-weighted asymptotic longitudes corresponds to time lag −169.41 ± 0.31 minutes, in close agreement with the observed lag. Thus, the cosine term is consistent with and provides a technique to cleanly measure the cosmic-ray anisotropy. In contrast, the peak term shows a time lag of –14.55 minutes, much closer to the –9.60 minutes lag in rotation due to the difference in geographic longitude. We find a similar behavior in the correlations between other pairs of stations. We propose that rapid fluctuations in the counting rate may be primarily due to cosmic-ray particles of very high energy.

It is well known that there is a time lag between the solar activity and the galactic cosmic-ray flux. How to accurately describe this delay is the key problem in making precise predictions of cosmic-ray flux. In this work, a response function in convolution is first used to describe the relative contribution of the solar wind blowout at earlier times to the current flux (the origin of time lag), and its explicit profile is obtained by our 3D time-dependent numerical model. It is found that our response function is superior to other functions in accounting for the time lag effect, and its rigidity and physical process dependence are studied thoroughly. At last, this description is partly demonstrated by a simplified derivation based on the underling physical processes.

<title>Detection of the Extended γ-Ray Emission from the New Supernova Remnant G321.3–3.9 with Fermi-LAT</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
With the 15 yr of Pass 8 data recorded by the Fermi Large Area Telescope, we report the detection of an extended gigaelectronvolt emission component with a 68% containment radius of 0.°85, which is spatially associated with the newly identified supernova remnant (SNR) G321.3–3.9. The γ-ray spectrum is best described by a log-parabola model in the energy range of 100 MeV–1 TeV, which shows a significant spectral curvature at ∼1 GeV. Either a leptonic or a hadronic model could explain the multiwavelength data of G321.3–3.9, while the leptonic model predicts a too-low strength of magnetic field. Also considering the flat radio spectrum of G321.3–3.9 and the γ-ray upper limit in the low energy band, the hadronic model is favored. The spatial coincidence between the γ-ray morphology and the diffuse thermal X-ray emission of G321.3–3.9 and the curved gigaelectronvolt γ-ray spectrum make G321.3–3.9 similar to the typical middle-aged SNRs interacting with molecular clouds (MCs). Such characteristics provide further evidence of the potential hadronic origin for its γ-ray emission. However, there is no MC detected around G321.3–3.9, which challenges the hadronic model.

<title>Embedded Young Stellar Objects near H72.97-69.39: A Forming Super Star Cluster in N79</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present 102 embedded young stellar object (YSO) candidates associated with the H72.97-69.39 super star cluster (SSC) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). With the use of the James Webb Space Telescope Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) imaging mode, we utilize an F770W – F1000W versus F1000W color–magnitude diagram to select 70 YSO candidates. An additional 27 YSO candidates are selected based on model fitting using the four MIRI imaging filters employed for this study (F770W, F1000W, F1500W, and F2100W). The central region of H72.97-69.39 is saturated in MIRI imaging, however it is covered by observations made with the Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS), leading to the identification of five additional massive YSOs. The total star formation rate inferred based on the 102 YSO candidates is 0.02 M⊙ yr−1, similar to other high-mass star-forming regions in the LMC which have undergone several generations of starburst events. Due to its young age, however, H72.97-69.39's stellar production rate is expected to increase. The central five YSOs identified with MRS have masses ranging from 21.1 to 40.3 M⊙ and total luminosity over 106L⊙, making H72.97-69.39 a very compact and luminous star-forming region similar to other known SSCs. We theorize that the central five massive YSOs were formed via filamentary collision, while other YSO candidates of varying masses were triggered by wind, radiation, and expanding H ii shells based on their spatial distribution.

研究通过MAESTROeX模拟热核氦点燃在氢丰富壳层下的演化过程。发现对流区的增长是由于渗透的流体元素冷却了上方的辐射层，而非对流区本身熵值的增加。同时，这些流动有效地混合了成分，将碳带出对流区，并在接触氢壳层之前将质子带入对流区。这些发现对未来这类事件的建模和观测具有重要的意义。 <div>
We perform the first multidimensional fluid simulations of thermonuclear helium ignition underneath a hydrogen-rich shell. This situation is relevant to Type I X-ray bursts on neutron stars that accrete from a hydrogen-rich companion. Using the low-Mach number fluid code MAESTROeX, we investigate the growth of the convection zone due to nuclear burning, and the evolution of the chemical abundances in the atmosphere of the star. We also examine the convective boundary mixing processes that cause the evolution to differ significantly from previous one-dimensional simulations that rely on mixing-length theory. We find that the convection zone grows outward as penetrating fluid elements cool the overlying radiative layer, rather than directly from the increasing entropy of the convection zone itself. Simultaneously, these flows efficiently mix composition, carrying carbon out of and protons into the convection zone even before contact with the hydrogen shell. We discuss the implications of these effects for future modeling of these events and observations.

Molecular hydrogen (H2) formation and dissociation are key processes that drive the gas life cycle in galaxies. Using the SImulating the LifeCycle of Molecular Clouds zoom-in simulation suite, we explore the utility of future observations of H2 dissociation and formation for tracking the life cycle of molecular clouds. The simulations used in this work include nonequilibrium H2 formation, stellar radiation, sink particles, and turbulence. We find that at early times in the cloud evolution H2 formation rapidly outpaces dissociation and molecular clouds build their mass from the atomic reservoir in their environment. Rapid H2 formation is also associated with a higher early star formation rate. For the clouds studied here, H2 is strongly out of chemical equilibrium during the early stages of cloud formation but settles into a bursty chemical steady state about 2 Myr after the first stars form. At the latest stage of cloud evolution, dissociation outweighs formation and the clouds enter a dispersal phase. We discuss how theories of the molecular cloud life cycle and star formation efficiency may be distinguished with observational measurements of H2 fluorescence with a space-based high-resolution far-UV spectrometer, such as the proposed Hyperion and Eos NASA Explorer missions. Such missions would enable measurements of the H2 dissociation and formation rates, which we demonstrate can be connected to different phases in a molecular cloud’s star-forming life, including cloud building, rapidly star forming, H2 chemical equilibrium, and cloud destruction.

The linear mixing approximation (LMA) is often used in planetary models for calculating the equations of state (EOS) of mixtures. A commonly assumed planetary composition is a mixture of rock and water. Here we assess the accuracy of the LMA for pressure–temperature conditions relevant to the interiors of Uranus and Neptune. We perform molecular dynamics simulations using ab initio simulations and consider pure water, pure silica, and 1:1 and 1:4 silica–water molecular fractions at a temperature of 3000 K and pressures between 30 and 600 GPa. We find that the LMA is valid within a few percent (< ∼5%) between ∼150 and 600 Gpa, where the sign of the difference in inferred density depends on the specific composition of the mixture. We also show that the presence of rocks delays the transition to superionic water by ∼70 GPa for the 1:4 silica–water mixture. Finally, we note that the choice of electronic theory (functionals) affects the EOS and introduces an uncertainty of the order of 10% in density. Our study demonstrates the complexity of phase diagrams in planetary conditions and the need for a better understanding of rock–water mixtures and their effect on the inferred planetary composition.

Gamma-ray emission is observed coincident in position to the evolved, composite supernova remnant (SNR) B0453–685. Prior multiwavelength investigations of the region indicate that the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) within the SNR is the most likely origin for the observed gamma rays, with a possible pulsar contribution that becomes significant at energies below E ∼ 5 GeV. Constraints on the PWN hard X-ray spectrum are important for the most accurate broadband representation of PWN emission and determining the presence of a gamma-ray pulsar component. The results of Parkes radio and Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) X-ray observations are presented on PWN B0453–685. We perform a search for the central pulsar in the new Parkes radio data, finding an upper limit of 12 μJy. A pulsation search in the new NuSTAR observations additionally provides a 3σ upper limit on the hard X-ray pulsed fraction of 56%. The PWN is best characterized with a photon index ΓX = 1.91 ± 0.20 in the 3–78 keV NuSTAR data, and the results are incorporated into existing broadband models. Last, we characterize a serendipitous source detected by Chandra and NuSTAR that is considered a new high-mass X-ray binary candidate.

We present 3D hydrodynamical simulations of core convection with a stably stratified envelope of a 25 M⊙ star in the early phase of the main sequence. We use the explicit gas-dynamics code PPMstar, which tracks two fluids and includes radiation pressure and radiative diffusion. Multiple series of simulations with different luminosities and radiative thermal conductivities are presented. The entrainment rate at the convective boundary, internal gravity waves in and above the boundary region, and the approach to dynamical equilibrium shortly after a few convective turnovers are investigated. We perform very long simulations on 8963 grids accelerated by luminosity boost factors of 1000, 3162 and 10,000. In these simulations, the growing penetrative convection reduces the initially unrealistically large entrainment. This reduction is enabled by a spatial separation that develops between the entropy gradient and the composition gradient. The convective boundary moves outward much more slowly at the end of these simulations. Finally, we present a 1D method to predict the extent and character of penetrative convection beyond the Schwarzschild boundary. The 1D model is based on a spherically averaged reduced entropy equation that takes the turbulent dissipation as input from the 3D hydrodynamic simulation and takes buoyancy and all other energy sources and sinks into account. This 1D method is intended to be ultimately deployed in 1D stellar evolution calculations and is based on the properties of penetrative convection in our simulations carried forward through the local thermal timescale.

<div> 47 Tuc, multimass equilibrium dynamical models, pulsar timing data, Milky Way globular clusters, mass distribution

这篇文章介绍了一种新的方法，结合多质量平衡动力学模型和脉冲星定时数据，以限制银河系球状星团（GCs）的质量分布和遗留物群。首先应用该方法到47 Tuc，一个有丰富的恒星动力学数据，也有大量毫秒脉冲星的星团。我们证明脉冲星定时数据甚至在没有恒星动力学拟合的情况下也可以对整体质量分布和遗留物群施加强大约束。我们的模型支持该星团中存在少量恒星质量黑洞（BHs）（总质量为），并且认为不需要存在大型（>2000 M⊙）的中等质量BH。然后我们将该方法应用到Terzan 5，一个有很大毫秒脉冲星群的严重阻挡的星团，该星团的常规恒星动力学数据非常有限。我们改善了对该星团质量分布和结构参数的现有约束，并对其黑洞含量施加了严格的约束，得出了对BH的质量的上限在∼4000 M⊙。这种方法即使在缺乏恒星动力学数据的情况下也可以探索GCs的中心动态，并且可以很容易地应用于其他具有脉冲星定时数据的GCs，随着下一代射电望远镜的数据集不断增长。 <br /><br />总结: 介绍了一种结合多质量平衡动力学模型和脉冲星定时数据的新方法，用于限制银河系球状星团（GCs）的质量分布和遗留物群。首先用于47 Tuc和Terzan 5两个星团，证明了即使在缺乏恒星动力学数据的情况下也可以探索GCs的中心动态，并对黑洞含量施加严格的约束。 <div>
We present a new method to combine multimass equilibrium dynamical models and pulsar timing data to constrain the mass distribution and remnant populations of Milky Way globular clusters (GCs). We first apply this method to 47 Tuc, a cluster for which there exists an abundance of stellar kinematic data and which is also host to a large population of millisecond pulsars. We demonstrate that the pulsar timing data allow us to place strong constraints on the overall mass distribution and remnant populations even without fitting on stellar kinematics. Our models favor a small population of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) in this cluster (with a total mass of ), arguing against the need for a large (>2000 M⊙) central intermediate-mass BH. We then apply the method to Terzan 5, a heavily obscured bulge cluster that hosts the largest population of millisecond pulsars of any Milky Way GC and for which the collection of conventional stellar kinematic data is very limited. We improve existing constraints on the mass distribution and structural parameters of this cluster and place stringent constraints on its black hole content, finding an upper limit on the mass in BHs of ∼4000 M⊙. This method allows us to probe the central dynamics of GCs even in the absence of stellar kinematic data and can be easily applied to other GCs with pulsar timing data, for which data sets will continue to grow with the next generation of radio telescopes.

<div> 关键词: SOFIA HAWC+, RCW 36, 磁场, 恒星反馈, 气体动力学
总结:
SOFIA HAWC+ 数据用于研究高质量星形成区RCW 36中磁场与恒星反馈之间的相互作用。采用HRO方法量化磁场与各种观测数据中的结构相对取向关系，并发现在密度较高的区域中，气体结构更倾向于垂直于磁场排列，而在光解区中倾向于平行排列。这表明磁场在RCW 36形成时对气体流动方向起到了重要作用，而在PDR区域，反馈效应可能支配磁场，使其几何形状发生变化。 <div>
We use polarization data from SOFIA HAWC+ to investigate the interplay between magnetic fields and stellar feedback in altering gas dynamics within the high-mass star-forming region RCW 36, located in Vela C. This region is of particular interest as it has a bipolar H ii region powered by a massive star cluster, which may be impacting the surrounding magnetic field. To determine if this is the case, we apply the histogram of relative orientations (HRO) method to quantify the relative alignment between the inferred magnetic field and elongated structures observed in several data sets such as dust emission, column density, temperature, and spectral line intensity maps. The HRO results indicate a bimodal alignment trend, where structures observed with dense gas tracers show a statistically significant preference for perpendicular alignment relative to the magnetic field, while structures probed by the photodissociation region (PDR) tracers tend to align preferentially parallel relative to the magnetic field. Moreover, the dense gas and PDR associated structures are found to be kinematically distinct such that a bimodal alignment trend is also observed as a function of line-of-sight velocity. This suggests that the magnetic field may have been dynamically important and set a preferred direction of gas flow at the time that RCW 36 formed, resulting in a dense ridge developing perpendicular to the magnetic field. However, on filament scales near the PDR region, feedback may be energetically dominating the magnetic field, warping its geometry and the associated flux-frozen gas structures, causing the observed preference for parallel relative alignment.

<title>Has the Palomar 14 Globular Cluster Been Captured by the Milky Way?</title>

<div> Palomar 14, outer halo, globular cluster, N-body calculations, dwarf galaxy<br />
总结:<br />这篇文章使用直接N体计算模拟了Pal 14的演化过程，假设它起源于一个与MW脱离或解体的矮星系，在那里演化了2-3亿年，然后被MW所俘获。研究表明，Pal 14在MW中扩展并最终达到适当的质量和大小，在模拟中成功复现了观测到的质量函数。模拟结果表明，Pal 14可能是在一个具有高度原始质量分离的矮星系中形成的，其初始半质量半径为7 pc，质量为8 < M/104 < 10 M⊙。 <div>
We examine a new scenario to model the outer halo globular cluster (GC) Palomar 14 (Pal 14) over its lifetime by performing a comprehensive set of direct N-body calculations. We assume Pal 14 was born in a now detached/disrupted dwarf galaxy with a strong tidal field. Pal 14 evolved there until the slope of the stellar mass function (MF) became close to the measured value, which is observed to be significantly shallower than in most GCs. After about 2–3 Gyr, Pal 14 was then captured by the Milky Way (MW). Although the physical size of such a cluster is indistinguishable from a cluster that has lived its entire life in the MW, other parameters like its mass and the MF slope, strongly depend on the time the cluster is taken from the dwarf galaxy. After being captured by the MW on a new orbit, the cluster expands and eventually reaches the appropriate mass and size of Pal 14 after 11.5 Gyr while reproducing the observed MF. These simulations thus suggest that Pal 14 may have formed in a dwarf galaxy with a post-gas expulsion initial half-mass radius and mass of rh = 7 pc and 8 < M/104 < 10 M⊙, respectively, with a high degree of primordial mass segregation.

The presence of dual active galactic nuclei (AGNs) on scales of a few tens of kiloparsecs can be used to study merger-induced accretion on supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and offer insights about SMBH mergers, using dual AGNs as merger precursors. This study uses the Romulus25 cosmological simulation to investigate the properties and evolution of dual AGNs. We first analyze the properties of AGNs (Lbol > 1043 erg s−1) and their neighboring SMBHs (any SMBHs closer than 30 pkpc to an AGN) at z ≤ 2. This is our underlying population. We then applied the luminosity threshold of Lbol > 1043 erg s−1 to the neighboring SMBHs thereby identifying dual and multiple AGNs. Our findings indicate an increase in the number of both single and dual AGNs from lower to higher redshifts. We also find that the number of dual AGNs with separations of 0.5–4 kpc is twice the number of duals with separations of 4–30 kpc. All dual AGNs in our sample resulted from major mergers. Compared to single AGNs, duals have a lower black hole-to-halo mass ratio. We found that the properties of dual AGN host halos, including halo mass, stellar mass, star formation rate, and gas mass, are generally consistent with those of single AGN halos, albeit tending toward the higher end of their respective property ranges. Our analysis uncovered a diverse array of evolutionary patterns among dual AGNs, including rapidly evolving systems, slower ones, and instances where SMBH mergers are ineffective.

<div> 关键词: O vi, H i-selected absorbers, metallicity, CGM Compendium, multiphase gas
总结:
本研究分析了在0.14 ≲ z ≲ 0.73范围内由H i选择的吸收者的O vi含量和动力学特征，并确定了它们冷光电离相的金属丰度。研究将吸收者分为100个强Lyα森林系统（SLFSs）和26个部分Lyman限制系统（pLLSs）。O vi检测率在低金属量和高金属量的SLFSs之间存在显著差异。我们发现O vi柱密度与金属丰度之间存在强相关性。最强和最宽的O vi吸收者几乎总是与HM吸收者相关联，而较弱的O vi吸收者则既出现在LM吸收者，也出现在HM吸收者。通过与星系选择和盲目O vi调查的比较，我们得出结论：具有 (O vi) ≳ 14的吸收者很可能起源于正在形成恒星的星系的CGM。具有弱O vi的吸收者可能追踪着扩展的CGM或星系间介质，而没有O vi的吸收者可能起源于星系间介质。 <br /><br /> <div>
We analyze the O vi content and kinematics for 126 H i-selected absorbers at 0.14 ≲ z ≲ 0.73 for which the metallicities of their cool photoionized phase have been determined. We separate the absorbers into 100 strong Lyα forest systems (SLFSs with 15 ≲ log N(H i) < 16.2) and 26 partial Lyman Limit systems (pLLSs with 16.2 ≤ log N(H i) ≤ 17.2). The sample is drawn from the COS CGM Compendium (CCC) and has O vi coverage in signal-to-noise ratio ≥ 8 Hubble Space Telescope/COS G130M/G160M QSO spectra, yielding a 2σ completeness level of (O vi) ≥ 13.6. The O vi detection rates differ substantially between low-metallicity (LM; [X/H] ≤ −1.4) and high-metallicity (HM; [X/H] > −1.4) SLFSs, with 20% and 60% detection rates, respectively. The O vi detection frequency for the HM and LM pLLSs is, however, similar at ∼60%. The SLFSs and pLLSs without detected O vi are consistent with the absorbing gas being in a single phase, while those with O vi trace multiphase gas. We show that the O vi velocity widths and column densities have different distributions in LM and HM gas. We find a strong correlation between O vi column density and metallicity. The strongest ( (O vi) ≳ 14) and broadest O vi absorbers are nearly always associated with HM absorbers, while weaker O vi absorbers are found in both LM and HM absorbers. From comparisons with galaxy-selected and blind O vi surveys, we conclude absorbers with (O vi) ≳ 14 most likely arise in the CGM of star-forming galaxies. Absorbers with weak O vi likely trace the extended CGM or intergalactic medium, while those without O vi likely originate in the intergalactic medium.

High-velocity outflows are ubiquitous in compact, massive (M* ∼ 1011M⊙), z ∼ 0.5 galaxies with extreme star formation surface densities (ΣSFR ∼ 2000 M⊙ yr−1 kpc−2). We have previously detected and characterized these outflows using Mg ii absorption lines. To probe their full extent, we present Keck/KCWI integral field spectroscopy of the [O ii] and Mg ii emission nebulae surrounding all of the 12 galaxies in this study. We find that [O ii] is more effective than Mg ii in tracing low surface brightness, extended emission in these galaxies. The [O ii] nebulae are spatially extended beyond the stars, with radial extent R90 between 10 and 40 kpc. The nebulae exhibit nongravitational motions, indicating galactic outflows with maximum blueshifted velocities ranging from −335 to −1920 km s−1. The outflow kinematics correlate with the bursty star formation histories of these galaxies. Galaxies with the most recent bursts of star formation (within the last <3 Myr) exhibit the highest central velocity dispersions (σ ≳ 400 km s−1), while the oldest bursts have the lowest-velocity outflows. Many galaxies exhibit both high-velocity cores and more extended, slower-moving gas indicative of multiple outflow episodes. The slower, larger outflows occurred earlier and have decelerated as they propagate into the circumgalactic medium and mix on timescales ≳50 Myr.

总结:
本研究针对位于银河系中心超大质量黑洞Sgr A*附近的IRS 1W的N源区域进行了研究，发现N源中有大部分呈现出北西飞行角。这些源可能受到中等质量黑洞(IMBH)的束缚，或者观测到的浓集现象是由于沿视线的盘状分布投影。研究还发现N源在H、Ks和波段中可被探测到，这些向西北飞行的源可能是一群束缚的星体。研究讨论了有无IMBH或倾斜的盘状分布来解释这些恒星的显著过密现象。首先的情形暗示了假定的IMBH的下限质量约为10^4太阳质量。我们的测量首次揭示了包含IRS 1W的恒星集合是一群大质量、年轻的恒星。这个恒星集合可能是目前朝向Sgr A*的潮汐剥离的巨大恒星团的残余核心。第二个情形表明，N源的出现可能受到年轻的He星和/或被尘埃包围的星体的盘状分布投影的影响。 <div>
We focus on a sample of 42 sources in the vicinity of the bow-shock source IRS 1W (N-source region), located at a distance of 6.″05 northeast of the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), within the radius of 1.″35. We present the first proper-motion measurements of N sources and find that a larger subset of N sources (28 sources) exhibit a north–west (NW) flying angle. These sources can be bound by an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) or the concentration that we observe is due to a disk-like distribution projection along the line of sight. We detect the N sources in the H, Ks, and bands. The NW-ward flying sources could be a bound collection of stars. We discuss the tentative existence of an IMBH or an inclined disk distribution to explain the significant overdensity of stars. The first scenario of having an IMBH implies the lower limit of ∼104M⊙ for the putative IMBH. Our measurements for the first time reveal that the dense association of stars containing IRS 1W is a comoving group of massive, young stars. This stellar association might be the remnant core of a massive stellar cluster that is currently being tidally stripped as it inspirals toward Sgr A*. The second scenario suggests that the appearance of the N sources might be influenced by the projection of a disk-like distribution of younger He-stars and/or dust-enshrouded stars.

<br />总结:
光波的偏振可以提供有关其天体发射源和传播介质的大量信息，对天文学的各个方面都至关重要。本文展示了在天体物理学中一个重要但长期被忽视的去极化机制：当光的偏振矢量沿着非平面曲线传播时，会经历额外的旋转，特别是对于无线电波。这个过程导致去极化，我们称之为“几何”去极化（GDP）。我们对在几何光学近似下线性偏振无线电波在随机非均匀等离子体中的传输的GDP效应进行了简明的理论分析。在日冕等离子体中进行各向同性散射的情况下，我们表明通过湍动等离子体传播的线性偏振无线电波的到达角的GDP效应是不容忽视的。线性偏振无线电波的GDP效应可以推广到天体现象，如快速无线电爆和恒星无线电爆等。我们的发现可能对分析天体去极化现象产生深远影响。 <div>
Polarization of electromagnetic waves carries a large amount of information about their astrophysical emitters and the media they passed through, and hence is crucial in various aspects of astronomy. Here we demonstrate an important but long-overlooked depolarization mechanism in astrophysics: when the polarization vector of light travels along a nonplanar curve, it experiences an additional rotation, in particular for radio waves. The process leads to depolarization, which we call “geometric” depolarization (GDP). We give a concise theoretical analysis of the GDP effect on the transport of radio waves in a randomly inhomogeneous plasma under the geometrical optics approximation. In the case of isotropic scattering in the coronal plasma, we show that the GDP of the angle of arrival of the linearly polarized radio waves propagating through the turbulent plasma cannot be ignored. The GDP effect of linearly polarized radio waves can be generalized to astrophysical phenomena, such as fast radio bursts and stellar radio bursts, etc. Our findings may have a profound impact on the analysis of astrophysical depolarization phenomena.

<div> 12C+12C nuclear reaction, stellar simulations, ultramassive white dwarfs, branching ratios, central abundances

总结: 本文研究了12C+12C核反应速率和其分支比对白矮星祖先的演化影响，发现分支比的不确定性是确定超巨星内部组成的主要因素。新的分支比会导致超巨白矮星核心中20Ne的中心丰度差异最多为17%，这将导致冷却时间和晶化核心尺寸的差异。然而，这对于脉动特性的影响很小。研究还发现，在一定质量范围内，超巨白矮星祖先的内部部分发生碳燃烧，形成混合的CONe-核心组合，这与纯CO核心的天体演化有显著差异。晶化核心尺寸和冷却时间的差异导致了周期间距分布的不同模式。 <div>
Recent determinations of the total rate of the 12C+12C nuclear reaction show non-negligible differences with the reference reaction rate commonly used in previous stellar simulations. In addition, the current uncertainties in determining each exit channel constitute one of the main uncertainties in shaping the inner structure of super asymptotic giant branch stars that could have a measurable impact on the properties of pulsating ultramassive white dwarfs (WDs). We explore how new determinations of the nuclear reaction rate and its branching ratios affect the evolution of WD progenitors. We show that the current uncertainties in the branching ratios constitute the main uncertainty factor in determining the inner composition of ultramassive WDs and their progenitors. We found that the use of extreme branching ratios leads to differences in the central abundances of 20Ne of at most 17%, which are translated into differences of at most 1.3% and 0.8% in the cooling times and size of the crystallized core, respectively. However, the impact on the pulsation properties is small, less than 1 s for the asymptotic period spacing. We found that the carbon burns partially in the interior of ultramassive WD progenitors within a particular range of masses, leaving a hybrid CONe-core composition in their cores. The evolution of these new kinds of predicted objects differs substantially from the evolution of objects with pure CO cores. Differences in the size of the crystallized core and cooling times of up to 15% and 6%, respectively, lead to distinct patterns in the period spacing distribution.

Studying the magnetic field properties on the solar surface is crucial for understanding the solar and heliospheric activities, which in turn shape space weather in the solar system. Surface flux transport (SFT) modeling helps us to simulate and analyze the transport and evolution of magnetic flux on the solar surface, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms responsible for solar activity. In this work, we demonstrate the use of machine learning techniques in solving magnetic flux transport, making it accurate. We have developed a novel physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based model to study the evolution of bipolar magnetic regions using SFT in one-dimensional azimuthally averaged and also in two dimensions. We demonstrate the efficiency and computational feasibility of our PINN-based model by comparing its performance and accuracy with that of a numerical model implemented using the Runge–Kutta implicit–explicit scheme. The mesh-independent PINN method can be used to reproduce the observed polar magnetic field with better flux conservation. This advancement is important for accurately reproducing observed polar magnetic fields, thereby providing insights into the strength of future solar cycles. This work paves the way for more efficient and accurate simulations of solar magnetic flux transport and showcases the applicability of PINNs in solving advection–diffusion equations with a particular focus on heliophysics.

总结:<br /><br />研究使用IXPE和NuSTAR观测了新发现的黑洞X射线双星Swift J151857.0-572147的光谱偏振特性。通过IXPE数据分析，采用模型无关方法报告了首次检测到的X射线偏振度(PD)为1.34 ± 0.27和偏振角(PA)为-13.°69 ± 5.°85；而模型相关的分析得到的PD为1.18±0.23和PA为-14.°01±5.°80。联合光谱分析和NuSTAR单独分析限制了中心BH质量约为9.2 ± 1.6至10.1 ± 1.7M⊙，自旋参数约为0.6 ± 0.1至0.7 ± 0.2，盘倾角约为35° ± 7°至46° ± 15°。辐射指数和截止能量分别为2.19 ± 0.03至2.47 ± 0.06和36 ± 4至78 ± 10 keV，表明了软谱状态的转变。<br />此外，相对较小的外部辐射区大小和较低的质量流出率，以及最佳契合的晕尺寸较小，低于盘吸积速率，进一步证实了相同的状态。在软状态下检测到的低PD可能是由于在密集的辐射区内的重复散射所致，并且来自盘的主要发射与低自旋和低盘倾角相一致。拟合得到的氢柱密度相对较高，约为4-5×1022cm−2。 <div>
We study the spectropolarimetric properties of a newly discovered black hole (BH) X-ray binary Swift J151857.0-572147 jointly using Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) and NuSTAR observations during 2024 March. The analysis of IXPE data reports the first detection of X-ray with a polarization degree (PD) of 1.34 ± 0.27 and a polarization angle (PA) of −13.°69 ± 5.°85 using a model-independent approach, while the model-dependent analysis gives a PD of 1.18 ± 0.23 and a PA of −14.°01 ± 5.°80. The joint spectral analysis of the broadband data and NuSTAR analysis in isolation constrain the mass of the central BH between ∼9.2 ± 1.6 and 10.1 ± 1.7M⊙ and a moderate spin parameter of ∼0.6 ± 0.1–0.7 ± 0.2 with a disk inclination of ∼35° ± 7°–46° ± 15°. The power-law photon index and cutoff energy are 2.19 ± 0.03–2.47 ± 0.06 and ∼36 ± 4–78 ± 10 keV, suggesting a transition to the soft spectral state. Additionally, a relatively lower corona size of 6 ± 1–9 ± 2rS, a low mass outflow rate ( ), and the best-fitted halo accretion is less compared to the disk accretion rate further confirm the same state. The low PD detected in the soft state can be due to repeated scattering inside the dense corona, and the dominant emission from the disk agrees with the low spin and low disk inclination. The hydrogen column density obtained from the fit is relatively high at ∼4–5 × 1022 cm−2.

<div> M-dwarf hosts, habitable zone, tidal effects, spin synchronization, Cassini State 2 (CS2)<br />
<br />总结:<br />针对M型矮星宿主的温带外行星，由于其与恒星的适居带接近，需要仔细考虑潮汐效应。研究发现，75%的M型矮星周围探测到的行星可能被激发到高倾角，并在随后的潮汐耗散过程中保持稳定。对于在CS2与宿主恒星适居带内的许多行星来说，潮汐状态的潜在捕获对于理解银河系中最常见的温带行星非常重要。 <div>
For temperate exoplanets orbiting M-dwarf hosts, the proximity of the habitable zone to the star necessitates careful consideration of tidal effects. Spin synchronization of the planetary orbital period and rotation period, tidal locking, and the subsequent impact on surface conditions frames common assumptions about M-dwarf planets. We investigate the plausibility of capture into Cassini State 2 (CS2) for a known sample of 280 multiplanet systems orbiting M-dwarf hosts. This resonance of the spin precession and orbital precession frequencies can excite planets into stable nonzero rotational obliquities, breaking tidal locking and inducing a version of “day” and “night.” Considering each planetary pair and estimating the spin and orbital precession frequencies, we find that 75% of detected planets orbiting M dwarfs may be plausibly excited to a high obliquity and maintain it through subsequent tidal dissipation over long timescales. We also investigate two possible mechanisms for capture into CS2: quantifying the orbital migration or primordial obliquity necessary for CS2. We find orbital migrations by a factor of ≲2 and an isotropic initial spin distribution can produce high-obliquity planets, aligning with similar findings for planets orbiting close-in to FGK dwarfs. Many of the planets in our sample reside in both CS2 and within their stellar habitable zone. Over half of the planets with Teq < 400 K around host stars with Teff < 3000 K could possess nonzero obliquity due to residence in CS2. This overlap renders the potential capture into Cassini States extremely relevant to understanding the galaxy’s most common temperate planets.

Binary stars are responsible for many unusual astrophysical phenomena, including some important explosive cosmic events. The stability criteria for rapid mass transfer and common-envelope evolution are fundamental to binary star evolution. They determine the mass, mass ratio, and orbital distribution of systems such as X-ray binaries and merging gravitational-wave sources. We use our adiabatic mass-loss model to systematically survey metal-poor and solar-metallicity donor thresholds for dynamical timescale mass transfer. The critical mass ratios qad are systematically explored and the impact of metallicity and nonconservative mass transfer are studied. For metal-poor radiative-envelope donors, qad are smaller than those for solar-metallicity stars at the same evolutionary stage. However, qad do the opposite for convective-envelope donors. Nonconservative mass transfer significantly decreases qad for massive donors. This is because it matters how conservative mass transfer is during the thermal timescale phase immediately preceding a delayed dynamical mass transfer. We apply our theoretical predictions to observed high-mass X-ray binaries that have overfilled their Roche lobes and find a good agreement with their mass ratios. Our results can be applied to study individual binary objects or large samples of binary objects with binary population synthesis codes.

<br />
本文讨论了恒星模型显示，星球的核心压缩度并不随着恒星质量单调增加。相反，在碳氧核心质量范围内，核心压缩度急剧下降；这个范围可能对恒星的金属丰度和演化历史有一定敏感性。这种压缩度下降的恒星预计会经历超新星爆发，留下中子星，而在此范围的两侧的恒星预计会形成黑洞。这导致了一个假设质量范围，其中黑洞很少形成。这些模型定量地预测，当应用于双星剥离恒星时，预计几乎没有组分质量为10M⊙–15M⊙的双黑洞。但是，第三次引力波瞬变目录的数据显示，我们没有找到这一现象的证据。如果这个间隙在自然界中确实存在，我们认为在当前（第四次）LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA观测运行结束时很难解决这个问题。
<br /><br />总结: 本文讨论了恒星模型对星球核心压缩度的影响，以及它对星际超新星和黑洞形成的影响。同时指出了引力波信号中可能存在的质量间隙，但最后指出目前难以通过观测解决这个问题。 <div>
Stellar models indicate that the core compactness of a star, which is a common proxy for its explodability in a supernova, does not increase monotonically with the star’s mass. Rather, the core compactness dips sharply over a range of carbon–oxygen core masses; this range may be somewhat sensitive to the star’s metallicity and evolutionary history. Stars in this compactness dip are expected to experience supernovae leaving behind neutron stars, whereas stars on either side of this range are expected to form black holes. This results in a hypothetical mass range in which black holes should seldom form. Quantitatively, when applied to binary stripped stars, these models predict a dearth of binary black holes with component masses ≈10M⊙–15M⊙. The population of gravitational-wave signals indicates potential evidence for a dip in the distribution of chirp masses of merging binary black holes near ≈10M⊙–12M⊙. This feature could be linked to the hypothetical component mass gap described above, but this interpretation depends on what assumptions are made of the binaries’ mass ratios. Here, we directly probe the distribution of binary black hole component masses to look for evidence of a gap. We find no evidence for this feature using data from the third gravitational-wave transient catalog. If this gap does exist in nature, we find that it is unlikely to be resolvable by the end of the current (fourth) LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA observing run.

这篇文章研究了中高质量星形成星系（SFGs）的结构演化情景，通过比较它们的恒星质量分布和现今的恒星质量，来探讨自宇宙中期以来的演化情况。作者发现了SFGs尺寸演化速率的差异可能是由于样本选择和尺寸测量方法的变化所导致。为了验证这些因素，研究团队使用恒星质量增长历史（SMGHs）并结合星际物质主序的演化情况来追踪个体星系的演化过程，并使用IllustrisTNG模拟进行了验证。研究发现，从质量和光度角度估计的结构参数表明，质量加权的尺寸演化速率比光度加权的慢，突显了需要考虑质量与光度比（M/L）梯度。此外，观察到恒星质量分布具有质量相关的演化：大质量星系在z ≳ 1.5形成中心区域，并在外部区域增长更快，暗示了内部-外部的增长模式，而中等质量和小质量星系自z ∼ 2以来遵循相对自相似的质量堆积。此外，观察到的尺寸演化斜率与TNG50的预测相矛盾。研究团队通过半质量尺寸演化和简单的盘形成模型，发现观测到的角动量在过去的100亿年中减少了一半，而TNG50中基本保持不变。这种模拟中更高的角动量可能是由于高角动量气体的吸积所致。 <br /><br />总结：本文研究了中高质量星形成星系的结构演化情况，发现了尺寸演化速率的差异，探讨了质量到光度比对这一结果的影响。在比较质量加权和光度加权的尺寸演化之后，发现质量加权的尺寸演化速率更慢，质量较大的星系在演化过程中呈现出内部区域的形成和外部区域的快速增长，而质量较小的星系则呈现相对自相似的质量增长趋势。研究团队还观察到了与TNG50模拟结果的尺寸演化斜率的矛盾，并通过模型验证发现了观测到的角动量减少与模拟结果的差异。 <div>
We aim to discern scenarios of structural evolution of intermediate-to-high-mass star-forming galaxies (SFGs) since cosmic noon by comparing their stellar mass profiles with present-day stellar masses of . We addressed discrepancies in the size evolution rates of SFGs, which may be caused by variations in sample selection and methods for size measurements. To check these factors, we traced the evolution of individual galaxies by identifying their progenitors using stellar mass growth histories (SMGHs), integrating along the star-forming main sequence and from the IllustrisTNG simulations. Comparison between the structural parameters estimated from the mass- and light-based profiles shows that mass-weighted size evolves at a slower pace compared to light-based ones, highlighting the need to consider the mass-to-light ratio (M/L) gradients. Additionally, we observed mass-dependent growth in stellar mass profiles: massive galaxies ( ) formed central regions at z ≳ 1.5 and grew faster in outer regions, suggesting inside-out growth, while intermediate-mass and less massive SFGs followed a relatively self-similar mass buildup since z ∼ 2. Moreover, slopes of observed size evolution conflict with the predictions of TNG50 for samples selected using the same SMGHs across our redshift range. To explore the origin of this deviation, we examined changes in angular momentum (AM) retention fraction using the half-mass size evolution and employing a simple disk formation model. Assuming similar dark matter halo parameters, our calculations indicate that the AM inferred from observations halved in the past 10 Gyr while it remained relatively constant in TNG50. This higher AM in simulations may be due to the accretion of high-AM gases into disks.

Aiming to capture the formation and eruption of flux ropes (FRs) in the source active regions (ARs), we simulate the coronal magnetic field evolution of the AR 11429 employing the time-dependent magneto-friction model (TMF). The initial field is driven by electric fields that are derived from time-sequence photospheric vector magnetic field observations by invoking ad hoc assumptions. The simulated magnetic structure evolves from potential to twisted fields over the course of two days, followed by rise motion in the later evolution, depicting the formation of an FR and its slow eruption later. The magnetic configuration resembles an inverse S-sigmoidal structure, composed of the potential field enveloping the inverse J-shaped fields that are sheared past one another and a low-lying twisted field along the major polarity inversion line. To compare with observations, proxy emission maps based on averaged current density along the field lines are generated from the simulated field. These emission maps exhibit a remarkable one-to-one correspondence with the spatial characteristics in coronal extreme ultraviolet images, especially the filament trace supported by the twisted magnetic field in the southwest subregion. Further, the topological analysis of the simulated field reveals the cospatial flare ribbons with the quasi-separatrix layers, which is consistent with the standard flare models; therefore, the extent of the twist and orientation of the erupting FR is indicated to be the real scenario in this case. The TMF model simulates the coronal field evolution, correctly capturing the formation of the FR in the observed timescale and the twisted field generated from these simulations serves as the initial condition for the full MHD simulations.

Eclipsing Algol-type systems containing a δ Scuti (hereafter δ Sct) star enable precise determination of physical parameters and the investigation of stellar internal structure and evolution. We present the absolute parameters of CZ Aquarius (hereafter CZ Aqr) based on TESS data. CZ Aqr has an orbital period of 0.86275209 day, a mass ratio of 0.489 (6), and the secondary component nearly fills its Roche lobe. O − C analysis reveals a downward parabolic trend and a cyclical variation with a period of 88.2 yr. The downward parabola suggests a long-term decrease in the orbital period with = −3.09 × 10−8 days yr−1. The mass loss rate is estimated to be 4.54 × 10−9M⊙ yr−1, which is possibly due to magnetic stellar wind or a hot spot. The cyclical variation might be caused by the light travel time effect via the presence of a third body with a minimum mass of = 0.312 (21) M⊙. Additionally, there are two possible celestial bodies in a 2:7 resonance orbit around CZ Aqr. The asymmetric light curve is explained by adding a hot spot on the surface of the primary star. After removing the binary model, 26 frequencies were extracted from TESS data. Two radial modes were newly identified among three possible independent frequencies. Our results show that the eclipsing Algol-type system is composed of a δ Sct primary star and a subgiant star in a quadruple system.

In this study, utilizing data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager–Debrecen Faculae Data Catalogue, we investigated solar facula distribution over timescales much larger than the individual lifetimes of faculae. We aimed to better comprehend the behavior of the Sun’s global magnetic field, where faculae play a role as markers. (1) Along the latitudinal direction, we observed the following in the appearance of faculae. (i) Short-term periods with the Carrington rotation (27.3 days) and some of its harmonics (approximately 13.5 and 9 day periods) are identified. In the northern hemisphere, there is also a faint 7 day period. (ii) We also identified longer periods. These longer periods, approximately between 150–300 and 300–500 days, exhibit a diminishing trend from the solar equator to the poles in both hemispheres. (2) Analyzing the distribution and evolution of the longitudinal coordinates of the faculae, we identified two pairs of active longitudes that are separated by 180° from each other.

It has been long observed at Mars that electron fluxes are enhanced during the tail current sheet crossings, of which the cause is not well understood. We use a novel approach to reveal one of the electron energization mechanisms with observations from the Mars Atmospheric and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission. We find the field-aligned potential, derived from comparing electron distribution functions, to be approximately linearly correlated with the logarithmic values of the local total ion density. This is the expected behavior of an ambipolar electrostatic potential. The large amplitude of potential (tens to hundreds of V) is a result of both a significant density gradient (1 order of magnitude) and the high electron temperature (tens of eV) in the tail. Such a mechanism is not limited to ion density enhancements at current sheet crossings but can be present anywhere that large ion density gradients and hot electrons are present.

The clumps are identified by the surface density of the star formation rate (SFR). About one-tenth of the snapshots show the existence of clumpy systems with two or more components. Most of the clumps are formed by mergers and can be characterized by their ages: central clumps dominated by stellar populations older than 50 Myr, and off-centered clumps dominated by younger stellar populations with specific SFRs of ∼50 Gyr−1. The latter type of young clumps is formed from gas debris in the tidal tails of major mergers with baryonic mass ratios of 1 ≤ q < 4. The merger-induced clumps are short-lived and merge within a dynamical time of several tens of million years. The number density of the clumpy systems is estimated to be ∼10−5 cMpc−3, which is large enough to be detected in recent JWST surveys.

<br /><br />
这项研究利用来自太阳动力学观测卫星的多波长数据，通过分析日珥黑子的跃动型慢磁声波来估算其低日冕和色球通道的形成高度，以及确定这些通道在安静条件下的形成高度。通过交叉相关技术，测量了不同通道之间的最频繁时间差，结合局部声速信息，估算出各通道的形成高度。结果显示，在样本中，UV通道的形成高度相对稳定（在250到500公里之间），而日冕通道的形成高度则变化较大。这项研究对理解太阳和其大气物理过程提供了重要的数据。 <br /> <div>
The multiwavelength data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory is extensively used in studying the physics of the Sun and its atmosphere. In this study, we estimate the formation heights of low-corona and chromospheric channels of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) over the atmospheres of sunspot umbrae during the quiet condition period within 20 different active regions. The upward propagating slow magnetoacoustic waves of a 3 minute period, which are perpetually present in sunspots, are utilized for this purpose. Employing a cross-correlation technique, the most frequent time lag between different channel pairs is measured. By combining this information with the local sound speed obtained from the characteristic formation temperatures of individual channels, we estimate the respective formation heights. The median values of formation heights obtained across all active regions in our sample are 356, 368, 858, 1180, and 1470 km, respectively, for the AIA 1600, 1700, 304, 131, and 171 Å channels. The corresponding ranges in the formation heights are 247–453, 260–468, 575–1155, 709–1937, and 909–2585 km, respectively. These values are measured with respect to the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager continuum. We find the formation height of UV channels is quite stable (between 250 and 500 km) and displays only a marginal difference between the AIA 1600 and 1700 Å channels during quiet conditions. On the other hand, the formation height of coronal channels is quite variable.

<title>Evidence of Extreme Ionization Conditions and Low Metallicity in GHZ2/GLASS-Z12 from a Combined Analysis of NIRSpec and MIRI Observations</title>

<div> 高红移星系 GHZ2/GLASS-z12；JWST 观测；红移测量；光谱特征；极端电离条件<br />
<br />总结:<br />研究了GHZ2星系的NIRSpec + MIRI谱数据。发现其具有极端的电离条件和高密度，推测可能是由于活跃星系核或是高密度星形成环境所致。此外，星系具有低金属丰度，表明其星际介质在过去几百万年中迅速进行了化学丰度。研究还指出大约10%的电离光子逸出GHZ2并开始重新电离周围的星系介质。最后，研究认为在高红移下，UV-至-光谱线比诊断可能已经接近其极限，因为这种方法可能受到这些极端红移星系独特条件的挑战。 <div>
GHZ2/GLASS-z12, one of the most distant galaxies found in JWST observations, has been recently observed with both the NIRSpec and MIRI spectrographs, establishing a spectroscopic redshift zspec = 12.34 and making it the first system at z > 10 with complete spectroscopic coverage from rest-frame UV to optical wavelengths. This galaxy is identified as a strong C ivλ1549 emitter (EW = 46 Å) with many other detected emission lines, such as N iv]λ1488, He iiλ1640, O iii]λλ1661,1666, N iii]λ1750, C iii]λλ1907,1909, [O ii]λλ3726,3729, [Ne iii]λ3869, [O iii]λλ4959,5007, and Hα, including a remarkable detection of the O iii Bowen fluorescence line at rest frame λ = 3133 Å. We analyze in this paper the joint NIRSpec + MIRI spectral data set. Combining six optical strong-line diagnostics (namely R2, R3, R23, O32, Ne3O2, and Ne3O2Hd), we find extreme-ionization conditions, with log10 ([O III]λλ4959,5007/[O II]λλ3726,3729) = 1.39 ± 0.19 and log10 ([Ne III]λ3869/[O II]λλ3726,3729) = 0.37 ± 0.18 in stark excess compared to typical values in the interstellar medium (ISM) at lower redshifts. These line properties are compatible either with an active galactic nucleus (AGN) or with a compact, very dense star-forming environment (ΣSFR ≃ 102–103M⊙ yr−1 kpc−2 and ≃ 104–105M⊙ pc−2), with a high ionization parameter (log10(U) =−1.75 ± 0.16), a high ionizing photon production efficiency , and a low gas-phase metallicity (also confirmed by the direct, Te method) ranging between 4% and 11% Z⊙, indicating a rapid chemical enrichment of the ISM in the past few megayears. These properties also suggest that a substantial amount of ionizing photons (∼10%) are leaking outside of GHZ2 and starting to reionize the surrounding intergalactic medium, possibly due to strong radiation-driven winds. The general lessons learned from GHZ2 are the following: (i) the UV-to-optical combined nebular indicators are broadly in agreement with UV-only or optical-only indicators; (ii) UV+optical diagnostics fail to discriminate between an AGN and star formation in a low-metallicity, high-density, and extreme-ionization environment; and (iii) comparing the nebular line ratios with local analogs may be approaching its limits at z ≳ 10, as this approach is potentially challenged by the unique conditions of star formation experienced by galaxies at these extreme redshifts.

We present the CO(1–0) maps of 28 infrared-bright galaxies from the Great Observatories All-Sky Luminous Infrared Galaxy Survey (GOALS) taken with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA). We detect 100 GHz continuum in 16 of the 28 CARMA GOALS galaxies, which trace both active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and compact star-forming cores. The GOALS galaxies show a variety of molecular gas morphologies, though in the majority of cases the average velocity fields show a gradient consistent with rotation. We fit the full continuum spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of each of the sources using either magphys or SED3FIT (if there are signs of an AGN) to derive the total stellar mass, dust mass, and SFRs of each object. We adopt a value determined from luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs) of αCO = M⊙ (K km s−1 pc2)−1, which leads to more physical values for fmol and the gas-to-dust ratio. Mergers tend to have the highest gas-to-dust ratios. We assume the cospatiality of the molecular gas and star formation and plot the CARMA GOALS sample on the Schmidt–Kennicutt relation, where we find that they preferentially lie above the line set by normal star-forming galaxies. This hyper-efficiency is likely due to the increased turbulence in these systems, which decreases the freefall time compared to star-forming galaxies, leading to “enhanced” star formation efficiency. Line wings are present in a non-negligible subsample (11/28) of the CARMA GOALS sources and are likely due to outflows driven by AGNs or star formation, gas inflows, or additional decoupled gas components.

Low-surface-brightness galaxies (LSBGs) are excellent probes of quenching and other environmental processes near massive galaxies. We study an extensive sample of LSBGs near massive hosts in the local universe that are distributed across a diverse range of environments. The LSBGs with surface-brightness are drawn from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 catalog while the hosts with masses comparable to the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud are selected from the z0MGS sample. We study the projected radial density profiles of LSBGs as a function of their color and surface brightness around hosts in both the rich Fornax–Eridanus cluster environment and the low-density field. We detect an overdensity with respect to the background density, out to 2.5 times the virial radius for both hosts in the cluster environment and the isolated field galaxies. When the LSBG sample is split by g − i color or surface brightness μeff, g, we find the LSBGs closer to their hosts are significantly redder and brighter, like their high-surface-brightness counterparts. The LSBGs form a clear “red sequence” in both the cluster and isolated environments that is visible beyond the virial radius of the hosts. This suggests preprocessing of infalling LSBGs and a quenched backsplash population around both host samples. More so, the relative prominence of the “blue cloud” feature implies that preprocessing is ongoing near the isolated hosts compared to the cluster environment where the LSBGs are already well processed.

Stellar bars in disk galaxies grow as stars in near-circular orbits lose angular momentum to their environments, including their dark matter (DM) halo, and transform into elongated bar orbits. This angular momentum exchange during galaxy evolution hints at a connection between bar properties and the DM halo spin λ, the dimensionless form of DM angular momentum. We investigate the connection between halo spin λ and galaxy properties in the presence/absence of stellar bars, using the cosmological magnetohydrodynamic TNG50 simulations at multiple redshifts (0 < zr < 1). We determine the bar strength (or bar amplitude, A2/A0), using Fourier decomposition of the face-on stellar density distribution. We determine the halo spin for barred and unbarred galaxies (0 < A2/A0 < 0.7) in the center of the DM halo, close to the galaxy’s stellar disk. At zr = 0, there is an anticorrelation between halo spin and bar strength. Strongly barred galaxies (A2/A0 > 0.4) reside in DM halos with low spin and low specific angular momentum at their centers. In contrast, unbarred/weakly barred galaxies (A2/A0 < 0.2) exist in halos with higher central spin and higher specific angular momentum. The anticorrelation is due to the barred galaxies’ higher DM mass and lower angular momentum than the unbarred galaxies at zr = 0, as a result of galaxy evolution. At high redshifts (zr = 1), all galaxies have higher halo spin compared to those at lower redshifts (zr = 0), with a weak anticorrelation for galaxies having A2/A0 > 0.2. The formation of DM bars in strongly barred systems highlights how angular momentum transfer to the halo can influence its central spin.

Most of the dynamical mass loss from star clusters is thought to be caused by the time variability of the tidal field (“tidal shocks”). Systematic studies of tidal shocks have been hampered by the fact that each tidal history is unique, implying both a reproducibility and a generalization problem. Here we address these issues by investigating how star cluster evolution depends on the statistical properties of its tidal history. We run a large suite of direct N-body simulations of clusters with tidal histories generated from power spectra of a given slope and with different normalizations, which determine the timescales and amplitudes of the shocks, respectively. At fixed normalization (i.e., the same median tidal field strength), the dissolution timescale is nearly independent of the power spectrum slope. However, the dispersion in dissolution timescales, obtained by repeating simulations for different realizations of statistically identical tidal histories, increases with the power spectrum slope. This result means that clusters experiencing high-frequency shocks have more similar mass-loss histories than clusters experiencing low-frequency shocks. The density–mass relationship of the simulated clusters follows a power law with slope between 1.08 and 1.45, except for the lowest normalizations (for which clusters effectively evolve in a static tidal field). Our findings suggest that star cluster evolution can be described statistically from a time-series analysis of its tidal history, which is an important simplification for describing the evolution of the star cluster population during galaxy formation and evolution.

The McVittie–Plummer spacetime is a spherically symmetric inhomogeneous cosmological model that represents a spherical star system embedded in a standard Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) cosmological model. We study the main physical properties of this gravitational field. Regarding the interplay between the physics of the local system and the expanding background, we employ the Misner–Sharp mass–energy function to show that there is a relatively weak time-dependent general relativistic coupling between the astrophysical system and the background FLRW cosmological model. The coupling term is proportional to the inverse of the scale factor and decreases as the Universe expands.

总结:
本研究对RM160（SDSS J141041.25+531849.0）进行了速度分辨的映射分析，监测了10年的数据。在分析过程中将观测基线分为低态和高态两个阶段，并观察到不同动力学特征的气体在不同状态下主导线发射。在低态时，Hβ VRLP显示出向宽线区域的流入特征，而在高态时趋于平坦。Hα VRLP在低态时表现出与被辐射的宽线区域质量成平方反比的特征，而在高态时显示出流入特征。研究发现宽线区域的半径和速度没有遵循恒定的维里量子。此外，宽线区域的滞后时间与连续光度存在相关性，这符合宽线区域气体对照射连续光的迅速响应。然而，宽线区域的运动特性以不可预测的方式变化，这与连续光度变化和回波滞后时间无关。研究结果表明，在像RM160这样的明亮和高度变化的类星体中，非维里动力学特性可能会显著影响观测到的线型，从而对黑洞质量的估算提出警告。 <div>
We present a velocity-resolved reverberation mapping analysis of the hypervariable quasar RM160 (SDSS J141041.25+531849.0) at z = 0.359 with 153 spectroscopic epochs of data representing a 10 yr baseline (2013–2023). We split the baseline into two regimes based on the 3× flux increase in the light curve: a “low state” phase during the years 2013–2019 and a “high state” phase during the years 2022–2023. The velocity-resolved lag profiles (VRLPs) indicate that gas with different kinematics dominates the line emission in different states. The Hβ VRLP begins with a signature of inflow onto the broad-line region (BLR) in the low state, while in the high state it is flatter with less signature of inflow. The Hα VRLP begins consistent with a virialized BLR in the low state, while in the high state shows a signature of inflow. The differences in the kinematics between the Balmer lines and between the low state and the high state suggests complex BLR dynamics. We find that the BLR radius and velocity (both FWHM and σ) do not obey a constant virial product throughout the monitoring period. We find that the BLR lags and continuum luminosity are correlated, consistent with rapid response of the BLR gas to the illuminating continuum. The BLR kinematic profile changes in unpredictable ways that are not related to continuum changes and reverberation lag. Our observations indicate that nonvirial kinematics can significantly contribute to observed line profiles, suggesting caution for black hole mass estimation in luminous and highly varying quasars like RM160.

总结:
本研究通过使用椭圆积分和光线追踪方法，分析了Kerr-Newman黑洞周围的光子轨迹。在低观测倾角时，粒子的次级图像嵌入在主图像内，但随着倾角增加，主次图像分离，形成了一个类似帽子的结构。黑洞的自旋和电荷以及观测倾角影响图像的不对称性和内部阴影的扭曲。在研究红移分布时，将吸积盘的内边界延伸到了事件视界，结果表明红移分布受观测倾角的显著影响。利用全景相机光线追踪技术对Kerr-Newman黑洞图像进行了详细分析，发现不同观测频率（特别是230 GHz和86 GHz）下，黑洞的光学外观和强度分布存在差异。同时还研究了顺行和逆行吸积盘情景下强度分布的差异，比较不同频率下的观测结果，发现86 GHz的总强度和峰值强度均高于230 GHz。 <div>
The image of a Kerr–Newman (KN) black hole (BH) surrounded by a thin accretion disk is derived. By employing elliptic integrals and ray-tracing methods, we analyze photon trajectories around the KN BH. At low observation inclination angles, the secondary image of particles is embedded within the primary image. However, as the inclination increases, the primary and secondary images separate, forming a hat-like structure. The spin and charge of the BH, along with the observer’s inclination angle, affect the image’s asymmetry and the distortion of the inner shadow. To investigate the redshift distribution on the accretion disk, we extended the inner boundary of the accretion disk to the event horizon. The results show that the redshift distribution is significantly influenced by the observation inclination angle. Furthermore, we conducted a detailed analysis of the KN BH image using fisheye camera ray-tracing techniques and found that the optical appearance and intensity distribution of the BH vary at different observation frequencies (specifically at 230 GHz and 86 GHz). We also examined differences in intensity distribution for prograde and retrograde accretion disk scenarios. Comparing observational at the two frequencies, we found that both the total intensity and peak intensity at 86 GHz are higher than those at 230 GHz.

We present JWST broadband images of the highly inclined protoplanetary disk SSTc2d J163131.2-242627 (Oph163131) from 2.0 to 21 μm. The images show a remarkable evolution in disk structure with wavelength, quite different from previous JWST observations of other edge-on disks. At 2.0 and 4.4 μm, Oph163131 shows two scattering surfaces separated by a dark lane, typical of highly inclined disks. Starting at 7.7 μm, however, (1) the two linear nebulosities flanking the dark lane disappear; (2) the brighter nebula tracing the disk upper surface transitions into a compact central source distinctly larger than the JWST point-spread function and whose intrinsic size increases with wavelength; and (3) patches of extended emission appear at low latitudes, and at surprisingly large radii nearly twice that of the scattered light seen with Hubble Space Telescope and NIRCam, and of the gas. We interpret the compact central source as thermal emission from the star and the inner disk that is not seen directly, but which instead is able to progressively propagate to greater distances at longer wavelengths. The lack of sharp-edged structures in the extended patchy emission argues against the presence of shocks and suggests photoexcitation or stochastic heating of material smoothly flowing away from the star along the disk surface. Finally, the dark lane thickness decreases significantly between 0.6 and 4.4 μm, which indicates that the surface layers of Oph163131 lack grains larger than 1 μm.

该研究利用MaNGA的积分场光谱数据，调查了邻近星系中尘埃衰减的径向依赖性。研究表明在星系中心，恒星质量、金属丰度和星际气体速度离散度等因素与尘埃衰减有强相关性。而在不同的半径区域和Hα发射强度不同的区域，尘埃衰减的关系显示出强烈的变化。针对尘埃气体衰减和恒星尘埃衰减，我们发现不同的区域和不同的性质显示出不同的相关性。这些发现对于高红移星系的研究具有重要意义。

We investigate the radial dependence of the scaling relations of dust attenuation in nearby galaxies using integral field spectroscopy data from MaNGA. We identify ionized gas regions of kiloparsec size from MaNGA galaxies, and for each region we estimate both the stellar attenuation E(B − V)star and gas attenuation E(B − V)gas. We then quantify the correlations of 15 regional/global properties with E(B − V)gas and E(B − V)star, using both the feature importance obtained with the Random Forest regression technique and the Spearman correlation coefficients. The importance of stellar mass, metallicity, and nebular velocity dispersion found previously from studies based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey can be reproduced if our analysis is limited to the central region of galaxies. The scaling relations of both E(B − V)gas and E(B − V)star are found to vary strongly as one goes from the galactic center to outer regions, and from Hα-bright regions to Hα-faint regions. For E(B − V)gas, [N ii]/[S ii] is top-ranked with a much higher correlation coefficient than any other property at 0 < R ≲ Re, while [O iii]/[O ii] outperforms [N ii]/[S ii] as the leading property in the outermost region. For E(B − V)star, stellar age shows the strongest correlation with no/weak dependence on radial distance, although ΣHα and specific star formation rate present similarly strong correlations with E(B − V)star in the galactic center. We find Hα-bright regions to generally show stronger correlations with E(B − V)gas, while Hα-faint regions are more strongly correlated with E(B − V)star, although this depends on individual properties and radial distance. The implications of our results for studies of high-z galaxies are discussed.

总结:
该研究旨在通过对高分辨率、高信噪比的类星体光谱进行线锁特征研究，探讨类星体外流动力学、辐射压在宇宙流动中的作用，以及早期宇宙的恒星形成历史和金属丰度。研究中使用了欧洲南方天文台的UV可见光Echelle分光仪获得了QSO J221531-174408的光谱，并通过C iv、N v 和 Si iv 双线识别相关吸收体，并测量其速度变化、覆盖率和柱密度。随后比较了不同吸收体之间的速度分离，发现了九对锁定的C iv双线、三对锁定的N v双线以及一对锁定的Si iv双线。研究还发现了三个复杂的线锁系统，其中三到五个吸收体通过多离子双线相互锁定。研究表明，线锁是类星体外流中的常见现象，未来需要建立涉及两个云和一个离子双线以上的更复杂的理论模型来解释这些复杂的线锁特征的形成。 <div>
Investigating line-locked phenomena within quasars is crucial for understanding the dynamics of quasar outflows, the role of radiation pressure in astrophysical flows, and the star formation history and metallicity of the early Universe. We have initiated the Tracking Outflow by Line Locking project to study quasar outflow by studying line-locking signatures using high-resolution high-signal-to-noise-ratio quasar spectra. In this paper, we present a case study of the line-locking signatures from QSO J221531-174408. The spectrum was obtained using the Very Large Telescope’s UV Visual Echelle Spectrograph. We first identify associated absorbers in the spectrum using C iv, N v, and Si iv doublets and measure their velocity shifts, covering fractions, and column densities through a line-profile-fitting technique. Then we compare the velocity separations between different absorbers, and detect nine pairs of line-locked C iv doublets, three pairs of line-locked N v doublets, and one pair of line-locked Si iv doublets. This is one of the four quasars known to possess line-locked signatures in C iv, Si iv, and N v at the same time. We also find three complex line-locked systems, where three to five absorbers are locked together through multi-ion doublets. Our study suggests that line locking is a common phenomenon in the quasar outflows, and theoretical models involving more than two clouds and one ionic doublet are needed in the future to explain the formation of these complex line-locking signatures.

<div> Alfvén waves, parametric decay instability, wave packets, boundary conditions, low-β plasma
<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了Alfvén波的参数衰变不稳定性，重点关注了有限大小的波包以及不同边界条件对生长速率的影响。研究表明，在低β等离子体中，圆形和弧极化波列在开放边界条件下比周期性边界条件稳定3-5倍。此外，当波包宽度ℓ小于系统尺寸L时，生长速率几乎呈现出γ ∝ ℓ/L的幂律下降。研究结果表明，泵波的稳定性与实验室设置密切相关，同时子波的生长速率取决于泵波的上下游条件以及其填充的体积分数。本研究可以解释局部Alfvén波的模拟和实验，同时也表明太阳风中的Alfvén波，包括称为开关返的尖锐脉冲，根据风条件可能比传统理论所暗示的更稳定。 <div>
The parametric decay instability of Alfvén waves has been widely studied, but few investigations have examined wave packets of finite size and the effect of different boundary conditions on the growth rate. In this paper, we perform a linear analysis of circular and arc-polarized wave trains and wave packets in periodic and open boundary systems in a low-β plasma. We find that both types of wave are 3–5 times more stable in open boundary conditions compared to periodic. Additionally, once the wave packet width ℓ becomes smaller than the system size L, the growth rate decreases nearly with a power law γ ∝ ℓ/L. This study demonstrates that the stability of a pump wave cannot be separated from the laboratory settings, and that the growth rate of daughter waves depends on the conditions downstream and upstream of the pump wave and on the fraction of volume it fills. Our results can explain simulations and experiments of localized Alfvén waves. They also suggest that Alfvénic fluctuations in the solar wind, including sharp impulses known as switchbacks, can be more stable than traditional theory suggests depending on wind conditions.

<title>A Possible Explanation of W-type Phenomena in V694 Peg</title>

V694 Peg是一个A型/浅接触双星系统，并经历了2013年至2019年的A型到W型转变。这种转变可能是由于组件上的大型冷斑点引起的，表明W型现象可能是由于成分的磁活动所引起的。通过收集了17年的505次光最小值时间，并且发现了长期的周期增加和11.81年的周期变化。这种周期变化可能是磁活动循环或第三体存在的结果。与其他A型和W型转变系统相比，V694 Peg被记录为最短周期的。这些转换系统都是晚期型（大于F7）接触双星，并显示出周期性的周期变化，这表明磁活动可能是导致两种接触双星类型转变的原因。发现更多转变接触双星对于研究A型和W型现象的本质至关重要。 <br /><br />总结: V694 Peg是一个A型到W型的双星系统，通过观察其光变曲线发现了一些有趣的特征，包括冷斑点和周期变化。这些特征可能与磁活动有关，为了更深入地了解这一现象，需要继续研究更多的类似系统。 <div>
Three sets of complete multicolor light curves of V694 Peg observed in 2013, 2015, and 2019 were presented and analyzed. Our photometric solutions show that this system was an A-type shallow contact binary in 2013 and 2015 while it converted to a W-type one in 2019. A large cool spot on the component of this binary could explain the conversion, implying the W-type phenomena may be caused by the magnetic activity of the components. We have collected available data on this binary and calculated 505 times of light minimum, which spans 17 yr. The orbital period investigation based on these timings shows there is a long-term period increase at a rate of dP/dt = 4.3(±0.3)×10−9 day yr−1 superposed on a periodic variation with a period of 11.81(±0.06) yr. The cyclic orbital variation may be the result of magnetic activity cycles or the existence of a third body. Until now, only eight transformed systems, including V694 Peg, have been reported. Compared with other converting contact systems between A-type and W-type, V694 Peg is recorded as the shortest-period one. All of these converting systems are late-type (later than F7) contact binaries with the O’Connell effect and show cyclic period variation, which indicates that magnetic activity may be the reason for the conversion between the two types of contact binaries. For investigating the nature of A-type and W-type phenomena, the discovery of more converting contact binaries is essential.

这项研究对质量缩口黑洞(IC 750)进行了详细的X射线光谱分析，发现了大量的相当于中性6.4keV的Fe Kα的等效宽度，这种等效宽度很少由除了密集遮挡物的荧光之外的其他过程产生。通过三种物理模型来拟合X射线光谱，得出了可能的内在2-10 keV光度区间，这些区间涵盖了模型选择的系统性不确定性。尽管预测的内在2-10keV光度在约10^41和10^43 erg s-1之间，但三种模型都认为IC 750具有Compton-thick的观测列密度，置信度超过99%。Compton-thick的遮蔽已被广泛文献证明对于超大质量黑洞AGN的追踪产生了重大偏差。因此，我们的结果首次表明，应该正确考虑Compton-thick的遮蔽，以无偏见地揭示和理解中等质量黑洞(IMBH)的群体。 <br /><br />总结: 关于质量缩口黑洞(IC 750)的X射线光谱分析结果显示，其具有Compton-thick的遮蔽，这表明Compton-thick的遮蔽对于发现和理解中等质量黑洞(IMBH)的群体同样具有重要意义。 <div>
Recent models suggest approximately half of all accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs; MBH ≳ 105M⊙) are expected to undergo intense growth phases behind Compton-thick (NH > 1.5 × 1024 cm−2) veils of obscuring gas. However, despite being a viable source for the seeding of SMBHs, there are currently no examples known of a Compton-thick accreting intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH; MBH ∼ 102–105M⊙). We present a detailed X-ray spectral analysis of IC 750—the only active galactic nuclei (AGN) to date with a precise megamaser-based intermediate mass <105M⊙. We find the equivalent width of neutral 6.4 keV Fe Kα to be keV via phenomenological modeling of the coadded 177 ks Chandra spectrum. Such large equivalent widths are seldom produced by processes other than fluorescence from dense obscuration. We fit three physically motivated X-ray spectral models to infer a range of possible intrinsic 2–10 keV luminosity posteriors that encompass the systematic uncertainties associated with a choice of model. Despite a wide range of predicted intrinsic 2–10 keV luminosities between ∼ 1041 and 1043 erg s−1, all three models agree that IC 750 has a Compton-thick line-of-sight column density to >99% confidence. Compton-thick obscuration is well-documented to impinge substantial bias on the pursuit of SMBH AGN. Our results thus provide the first indication that Compton-thick obscuration should also be properly considered to uncover and understand the IMBH population in an unbiased manner.

<div> 星系形成模拟，能量守恒阶段，超新星事件，SMUGGLE模型，Mvir ∼ 1010M⊙矮星系

在这篇论文中，研究了用SMUGGLE恒星反馈模型进行的星系模拟。对Mvir ∼ 1010M⊙矮星系进行了理想化模拟，并发现通过改变超新星释放给周围气体的动量的方向分布，可以放大或完全抑制星形成的爆发性，且最终形成的恒星总质量可以相差近3倍。具体来说，当动量主要是垂直于气体盘时，星形成不太爆发，并且整体星形成率较低，导致较少的气体湍流，更多盘状形态，并保留尖锐暗物质密度轮廓。这表明需要改进对恒星反馈与非均匀气态介质之间的非线性耦合的理解，以使矮星系的恒星形态和暗物质核心形成的预测更加稳健，且不依赖于有关重子处理的不确定数值选择。

<br /><br />总结：
1. 研究了用SMUGGLE模型进行的星系模拟
2. 发现动量方向会影响星形成的爆发性和总质量
3. 当动量垂直于气体盘时，星形成较缓和且整体星形成率较低
4. 需要改进恒星反馈与非均匀气态介质之间的耦合理解
5. 对矮星系的恒星形态和暗物质核心形成的预测需要更加稳健，不依赖于数值选择。 <div>
Simulations of galaxy formation are mostly unable to resolve the energy-conserving phase of individual supernova events, having to resort to subgrid models to distribute the energy and momentum resulting from stellar feedback. However, the properties of these simulated galaxies, including the morphology, stellar mass formed, and the burstiness of the star formation history, are highly sensitive to the numerical choices adopted in these subgrid models. Using the SMUGGLE stellar feedback model, we carry out idealized simulations of an Mvir ∼ 1010M⊙ dwarf galaxy, a regime where most simulation codes predict significant burstiness in star formation, resulting in strong gas flows that lead to the formation of dark matter cores. We find that by varying only the directional distribution of momentum imparted from supernovae to the surrounding gas, while holding the total momentum per supernova constant, bursty star formation may be amplified or completely suppressed, and the total stellar mass formed can vary by as much as a factor of ∼3. In particular, when momentum is primarily directed perpendicular to the gas disk, less bursty and lower overall star formation rates result, yielding less gas turbulence, more disky morphologies, and a retention of cuspy dark matter density profiles. An improved understanding of the nonlinear coupling of stellar feedback into inhomogeneous gaseous media is thus needed to make robust predictions for stellar morphologies and dark matter core formation in dwarfs independent of uncertain numerical choices in the baryonic treatment.

Constraining planet-formation models based on the observed exoplanet population requires generating large samples of synthetic planetary systems, which can be computationally prohibitive. A significant bottleneck is simulating the giant-impact phase, during which planetary embryos evolve gravitationally and combine to form planets, which may themselves experience later collisions. To accelerate giant-impact simulations, we present a machine learning (ML) approach to predicting collisional outcomes in multiplanet systems. Trained on more than 500,000 N-body simulations of three-planet systems, we develop an ML model that can accurately predict which two planets will experience a collision, along with the state of the postcollision planets, from a short integration of the system’s initial conditions. Our model greatly improves on non-ML baselines that rely on metrics from dynamics theory, which struggle to accurately predict which pair of planets will experience a collision. By combining with a model for predicting long-term stability, we create an ML-based giant-impact emulator, which can predict the outcomes of giant-impact simulations with reasonable accuracy and a speedup of up to 4 orders of magnitude. We expect our model to enable analyses that would not otherwise be computationally feasible. As such, we release our training code, along with an easy-to-use user interface for our collision-outcome model and giant-impact emulator (https://github.com/dtamayo/spock).

Modeling the transport of low-energy (1−10 MeV) cosmic-ray electrons can lead to valuable insights as to the behavior of the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF), due to the fact that the mean free path (MFP) of these particles parallel to the HMF is significantly larger than their perpendicular MFP, and that these particles experience little in the way of drift due to gradients/curvatures in the HMF and along the heliospheric current sheet. Jovian electrons are particularly suitable for such an endeavour, as they originate from a decentral source in the inner heliosphere. To this end, the transport of these electrons is studied using a 3D, ab initio particle transport code that incorporates theoretical expressions for electron diffusion coefficients, and utilizes as inputs for these transport coefficients turbulence quantities calculated using a two-component turbulence transport model. The effects of a novel Fisk-type field on the transport of these Jovian electrons are investigated and compared with the effects of a standard Parker field.

<div> 磁星、快速射电暴、辐射机制、空间扩散、辐射锥<br />
总结：<br />
本文研究了快速射电暴（FRBs）可能起源于磁星磁层的情况，通过模拟发现，当FRB的传播方向与背景磁场夹角很小时，其散射效应会大大减弱。经过对辐射角度和发射半径的研究，得出FRB在磁星磁层发生的可能性较大。FRB的小辐射角和大发射半径对于其在磁层内的传播有益。文章结果支持了FRB可能源自磁星磁层的假设。 <div>
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration transients observed in the radio band, with their origin and radiation mechanism remaining unclear to date. Growing evidence indicates that at least some FRBs originate from magnetars and are likely generated within the magnetospheres of these highly magnetized neutron stars. However, a recent study suggested that FRBs originating from magnetar magnetospheres would be scattered by magnetospheric electron–positron pair plasma, making it impossible for them to escape successfully. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the scattering effect can be greatly attenuated if the angle between the FRB propagation direction and the background magnetic field is ∼10−2 rad or smaller. When the angle is around 10−1 rad, the beaming effect of FRBs becomes significant in reducing scattering. Such FRBs have small transverse spatial sizes, which can help them instantly push the front plasma laterally out of the radiation region. This significantly mitigates the FRB-induced two-photon annihilation reaction, γ + γ → e− + e+, which was previously regarded as a key factor hindering the propagation of FRBs. A critical radiation-cone half-opening angle between 10−3 and 10−2 rad is found for an FRB with isotropic luminosity Liso ∼ 1042 erg s−1 and emitted at a radius rem ≲ 109 cm in the magnetosphere of a magnetar. Smaller beaming angles and larger emission radii can be more advantageous for the propagation of FRBs in magnetospheres. Our result supports the scenario that FRBs could originate from magnetar magnetospheres.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章主要讨论了围绕着恒星质量黑洞的中微子主导的吸积流(NDAF)被认为是伽马射线暴(GRBs)的中心引擎。中微子从盘上逃逸，将在盘外发生湮灭以产生能够支撑带有黑体成分的GRB的火球。研究收集了七个已知红移且具有BB成分的GRB，并发现大多数情况下，吸积率和中心黑洞属性的数值都在合理范围内，这表明这些BB成分确实源自中微子湮灭过程。 <div>
A stellar-mass black hole (BH) surrounded by a neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF) is generally considered to be the central engine of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Neutrinos escaping from the disk will annihilate outside the disk to produce the fireball that could power GRBs with blackbody (BB) components. The initial GRB jet power and fireball launch radius are related to the annihilation luminosity and annihilation height of the NDAFs, respectively. In this paper, we collect seven GRBs with known redshifts and identified BB components to test whether the NDAF model works. We find that, in most cases, the values of the accretion rates and the central BH properties are all in the reasonable range, suggesting that these BB components indeed originate from the neutrino annihilation process.

Polarization measurements provide insight into the magnetic field, a critical aspect of the dynamics and emission properties around the compact object. In this paper, we present the polarized magnetic field of the Crab outer torus and the Vela arc utilizing Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer observation data. The polarization angle (PA) measured for the Crab outer torus exhibits two monotonic evolutions along the azimuth angle, which are consistent with the normal line of the elliptical ring. There is a slight increase in PA along the azimuth angle for both the inner arc and the outer arc of the Vela Nebula. The polarized magnetic vector along the outer torus of the Crab Nebula shows the polarized magnetic field aligns with the Crab outer torus structure. The PA variation along the Crab outer torus suggests a bulk flow speed of 0.8c. Meanwhile, the Vela Nebula polarized magnetic field does not exactly align with the Vela arc structure. We noted that the Crab Nebula possesses a polarized toroidal magnetic field, whereas the Vela Nebula exhibits an incomplete toroidal magnetic field.

这项研究分析了2014年至2019年间Spitzer Space Telescope观测到的约950个微引力透镜事件样本，重点关注了9个微引力透镜事件子样本，根据它们的长时间尺度、小微引力透镜视差和Gaia任务的联合观测进行了选择，以增加所选透镜为巨大并且质量可测量的概率。在所选事件中，识别了黑洞和中子星候选透镜，并有望通过2026年Gaia时序测量数据的发布进行进一步确认。利用贝叶斯分析和银河模型，以及Gaia数据发布3的恰当运动数据，确定了四个潜在的暗残余体候选者：OGLE-2016-BLG-0293，OGLE-2018-BLG-0483，OGLE-2018-BLG-0662和 OGLE-2015-BLG-0149，其透镜质量分别为，，和。值得注意的是，前两个候选者有望展现Gaia可探测到的天文微引力透镜信号，从而提供验证透镜质量的可能性。本研究中开发的方法将应用于整个Spitzer微引力透镜样本，填补和分析时间尺度（tE）与视差（πE）图，以推导透镜总体和巨大残余体特别是残余体的约束。

In the pursuit of understanding the population of stellar remnants within the Milky Way, we analyze the sample of ∼950 microlensing events observed by the Spitzer Space Telescope between 2014 and 2019. In this study we focus on a subsample of nine microlensing events, selected based on their long timescales, small microlensing parallaxes, and joint observations by the Gaia mission, to increase the probability that the chosen lenses are massive and the mass is measurable. Among the selected events we identify lensing black holes and neutron star candidates, with potential confirmation through forthcoming release of the Gaia time-series astrometry in 2026. Utilizing Bayesian analysis and Galactic models, along with the Gaia Data Release 3 proper-motion data, four good candidates for dark remnants were identified: OGLE-2016-BLG-0293, OGLE-2018-BLG-0483, OGLE-2018-BLG-0662, and OGLE-2015-BLG-0149, with lens masses of , , and , respectively. Notably, the first two candidates are expected to exhibit astrometric microlensing signals detectable by Gaia, offering the prospect of validating the lens masses. The methodologies developed in this work will be applied to the full Spitzer microlensing sample, populating and analyzing the timescale (tE) versus parallax (πE) diagram to derive constraints on the population of lenses in general and massive remnants in particular.

Lyα光谱，星系，JWST，红移，再电离<br /><br />总结:
本研究分析了JWST对z≳6.5星系的Lyα光谱，使用了公共数据库中的观测数据，涵盖了四个独立领域：GOOS-N、GOODS-S、A2744和EGS。我们测量了210个z≃6.5-13星系的Lyα发射线特性，并在所有案例中独立于Lyα确认了红移。我们发现三个新的Lyα发射线的探测，并且在GOOS-N中发现了一个大等效宽度（EW=143 Å）的Lyα发射线（LAE），并且还有强C iv发射（EW=21 Å），红移为7.1。我们测量了样本中Lyα等效宽度随红移的分布。我们发现在更早的时期，强Lyα发射（EW>25 Å）变得越来越罕见，暗示Lyα光子的传输在z≃5和z≃9之间下降了4倍。我们描述了对星系间介质中性分数的潜在影响。LAE比例在不同领域之间存在显著差异。与其他三个领域不同，EGS在z≃7-8没有减少Lyα光子的传输迹象，这表明该领域可能存在明显的电离视线。我们使用了来自第一再电离纪元光谱完整观测调查的NIRCam光栅观测数据，用于描述在GOOS领域周围已知LAE的大尺度密度过剩。在大多数情况下，最强的过剩密度似乎与极强的Lyα检测（EW>50 Å）有关。未来JWST的Lyα光谱观测有潜力约束早期星系密度周围电离区域的大小，提供再电离过程的新探针。 <div>
We present an analysis of JWST Lyα spectroscopy of z ≳ 6.5 galaxies, using observations in the public archive covering galaxies in four independent fields: Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS)-N, GOODS-S, A2744, and the Extended Groth Strip (EGS). We measure the Lyα emission line properties for a sample of 210 z ≃ 6.5–13 galaxies, with redshifts confirmed independently of Lyα in all cases. We present three new detections of Lyα emission in JWST spectra, including a large equivalent width (EW; =143 Å) Lyα emitter (LAE) with strong C iv emission (EW = 21 Å) at z = 7.1 in GOODS-N. We measure the redshift-dependent Lyα EW distribution across our sample. We find that strong Lyα emission (EW > 25 Å) becomes increasingly rare at earlier epochs, suggesting that the transmission of Lyα photons decreases by 4× between z ≃ 5 and z ≃ 9. We describe potential implications for the intergalactic medium neutral fraction. There is significant field-to-field variance in the LAE fraction. In contrast to the three other fields, the EGS shows no evidence for reduced transmission of Lyα photons at z ≃ 7–8, suggesting a significantly ionized sight line may be present in the field. We use available NIRCam grism observations from the First Reionization Epoch Spectroscopically Complete Observations survey to characterize overdensities on large scales around known LAEs in the GOODS fields. The strongest overdensities appear linked with extremely strong Lyα detections (EW > 50 Å) in most cases. Future Lyα spectroscopy with JWST has the potential to constrain the size of ionized regions around early galaxy overdensities, providing a new probe of the reionization process.

<div> 强度映射, 大尺度, 宇宙学调查, 交叉相关, 蒙特卡洛模拟
<br />
强度映射是大规模测量选定光谱线但不分辨个体源的方法，目前正在迅速兴起并成为进行大型宇宙学调查的有效方式。多个调查涵盖各种光谱线（如氢原子的21厘米超精细线，一氧化碳的旋转谱线以及[C ii]精细结构线等），正在进行观测或即将上线，承诺在广泛红移范围内为我们提供宇宙的全光谱视图。交叉相关已成为一个有吸引力的前景，既可以探测潜在的天体物理，又可以减轻观测系统的系统偏差。本文构建了一个端到端的分析强度映射交叉相关的流程，通过蒙特卡洛模拟传播仪器效应、前景残留和分析选择到一组严格的误差属性，包括误差协方差、窗函数和功率谱估计的完整概率分布。我们使用这一框架来批判性地检验简化假设的适用性，比如功率谱误差的独立性和高斯性。作为案例，我们预测了近期和未来的21厘米×[C ii]交叉相关测量的灵敏度，并提出了对调查设计的建议。 
<br /><br />总结: 强度映射是一种快速兴起的大规模宇宙学调查方法，利用交叉相关可以探测天体物理和减轻观测系统误差。文章构建了一个分析强度映射交叉相关的流程，并使用蒙特卡洛模拟来传播误差属性，最后对近期和未来的调查提出了建议。 <div>
Intensity mapping—the large-scale mapping of selected spectral lines without resolving individual sources—is quickly emerging as an efficient way to conduct large cosmological surveys. Multiple surveys covering a variety of lines (such as the hydrogen 21 cm hyperfine line, carbon-monoxide rotational lines, and [C ii] fine-structure lines, among others) are either observing or will soon be online, promising a panchromatic view of our Universe over a broad redshift range. With multiple lines potentially covering the same volume, cross-correlations have become an attractive prospect, both for probing the underlying astrophysics and for mitigating observational systematics. For example, cross-correlating 21 cm and [C ii] intensity maps during reionization could reveal the characteristic scale of ionized bubbles around the first galaxies, while simultaneously providing a convenient way to reduce independent foreground contaminants between the two surveys. However, many of the desirable properties of cross-correlations in principle emerge only under ideal conditions, such as infinite ensemble averages. In this paper, we construct an end-to-end pipeline for analyzing intensity mapping cross-correlations, enabling instrumental effects, foreground residuals, and analysis choices to be propagated through Monte Carlo simulations to a set of rigorous error properties, including error covariances, window functions, and full probability distributions for power-spectrum estimates. We use this framework to critically examine the applicability of simplifying assumptions such as the independence and Gaussianity of power-spectrum errors. As worked examples, we forecast the sensitivity of near-term and futuristic 21 cm × [C ii] cross-correlation measurements, providing recommendations for survey design.

总结: <br />
本文报告了来自NOAA 11261活动区域的M9.3耀斑和线状物活动，它们受3D磁学骨架的强烈调节。通过磁场外推法发现了复杂的磁连接和活动区域东南方存在一个高日冕虚点。小型线状物在倒V型极性反转线上方喷发，导致M9.3耀斑并形成相对较大的线状物。硬X射线辐射轨迹显示磁重联点向上沿着日冕虚点传播。同时，EUV观察显示了日冕质量抛射样式的喷发特征。闭合扇区限制了大型线状物和相应的耀斑。我们展示了磁学骨架和活动之间的时空关系，并得出结论，磁学骨架可以调节并确定所研究活动的几乎所有特征。 <div>
We report an M9.3 flare and filaments activities from NOAA Active Region 11261 that are strongly modulated by the 3D magnetic skeleton. Magnetic field extrapolation from the vector magnetic field suggests complex magnetic connectivity and the existence of a high coronal null point southeast of the active region. A small filament over the inversed V-shaped polarity inversion line erupted and resulted in the M9.3 flare associated with a weak ejection in the EUV hot channel and the formation of a relatively large filament. Both the weak ejection and the eruption of the large filament were toward the southeast. Comparative analyses have disclosed the following new facts. First, the trajectory of looptop hard X-ray emission provides solid evidence that the magnetic reconnection site propagated up toward the coronal null point as the flare and filaments erupted. Second, the EVU observations show coronal mass ejection-like eruption features in the ejection region of the magnetic skeleton. Third, the closed fan confined the west end of the large filament and the corresponding flare ribbons. We demonstrate a spatiotemporal relationship between the magnetic skeleton and the flare filament activity. We conclude that the magnetic skeleton can modulate and determine almost all the characteristics of the studied activity in the corresponding scale.

<div> 磁场，太阳风，静止区域，热性质，太阳辐射<br />
总结:<br />
Parker Solar Probe观测到了具有近径向Parker螺旋几何形状的磁场区域，被称为静止区域。这些区域在太阳风的磁场强度变化（δB/〈∣B∣〉）方面表现出非常低的特点。静止区域具有较低的太阳风速度、质子温度和质子密度。在15个太阳半径内，静止区域显示出明显的热性质差异，具有较高的质子温度各向异性和较低的平行等离子体贝塔值。静止区域的太阳风在-β∥p图上更加稳定，表明其起源与周围更湍流的非静止太阳风不同。因此，增强的温度各向异性和增强的磁场强度可能与磁场线经历的磁场膨胀程度较小有关。 <div>
Regions of magnetic fields with near-radial, Parker-spiral-like geometry known as quiescent regions have been observed in Parker Solar Probe data. These regions have very low δB/〈∣B∣〉 compared to nonquiescent solar wind at the same heliocentric distances. Quiescent regions are observed to have lower solar wind bulk speeds, lower proton temperatures, and lower proton density. Inside of 15 solar radii (R⊙), identified quiescent regions show distinct thermal properties, having higher proton temperature anisotropies and lower parallel plasma betas compared to switchback patches observed at the same heliocentric distances. When placed on -versus-β∥p plots (where is the proton temperature anisotropy), quiescent region solar wind is shown to be more stable to proton cyclotron and firehose instabilities than nonquiescent solar wind at the same heliocentric distances. It is shown that quiescent regions evolve similarly to the surrounding nonquiescent solar wind, but quiescent solar wind begins at a different location in the -versus-β∥p parameter space, suggesting that these regions have separate origins from the more turbulent nonquiescent solar wind. Namely, enhanced temperature anisotropies and enhanced magnetic field strength may be consistent with magnetic field lines that have undergone less magnetic field expansion compared to nonquiescent wind at the same heliocentric distances.

研究人员开发了一种新方法，利用脉冲星的法拉第旋转测量来研究螺旋臂沿线的银河磁场。他们的新技术考虑了法拉第旋转的点积性质，并将相关路径积分分割成沿视线的特定区域。研究人员将这种几何校正的一臂一臂技术应用于最近发表的313颗脉冲星的阿雷西博法拉第旋转测量的低纬度部分，并与先前在相同区域获得的旋转测量进行比较。他们发现在局部臂、人马座臂、人马座-天蝎座臂间隙、天蝎座臂和英仙座臂的平面上下的磁场大小存在超过1σ的差异。此外，他们发现在局部臂-人马座臂边界附近存在单一的磁场反转。有趣的是，研究结果表明，这种磁场反转取决于纬度，在银河负纬度处在人马座臂内发生，在正纬度处在局部臂-人马座臂边界发生。研究人员将所有结果讨论在不同模型和其他观测银河磁场分析的背景下。

We develop a new method for studying the Galactic magnetic field along the spiral arms using pulsar Faraday rotation measures (RMs). Our new technique accounts for the dot-product nature of Faraday rotation and also splits the associated path integral into segments corresponding to particular zones along the line of sight. We apply this geometrically corrected, arm-by-arm technique to the low-latitude portion of a recently published set of Arecibo Faraday RMs for 313 pulsars, along with previously obtained RMs in the same regions. We find disparities >1σ between the magnitude of the field above and below the plane in the Local Arm, Sagittarius Arm, Sagittarius-to-Scutum Interarm, Scutum Arm, and Perseus Arm. We find evidence for a single field reversal near the Local Arm–Sagittarius Arm boundary. Interestingly, our results suggest that this field reversal is dependent on latitude, occurring inside the Sagittarius Arm at negative Galactic latitudes and at the Local Arm–Sagittarius Arm boundary at positive Galactic latitudes. We discuss all of our results in the context of different models and other observational Galactic magnetic field analyses.

总结:
这项研究利用第三次LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA引力波瞬变目录中的43个引力波源和Pantheon+合编的1590个光度曲线，来约束暗能量模型，以实现对宇宙参数的精确测量。利用暗射波引力波事件，估计相应的红移。引力波和超新星联合数据能够提供对ΛCDM模型哈勃常数H0和现在物质密度Ωm约16%和8%的精度，并约束暗能量状态方程w的精度约为24%。尽管联合引力波和超新星观测有效地打破了各种宇宙学参数的简并，得到了更严格的约束，但这些约束的精度仍不符合精密宇宙学所需的严格标准。然而，可以合理预期，在不久的将来，引力波和超新星的联合观测将成为在晚期宇宙尤其是对宇宙参数进行精确测量的强大工具。 <div>
The growing tensions between the early Universe and the late Universe increasingly highlight the importance of developing precise probes for late cosmology. As significant late-Universe probes, Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and gravitational waves (GWs) can provide measurements of relative and absolute distances, respectively. Their complementary nature is likely to break the degeneracies among cosmological parameters, thereby yielding more precise constraints. In this study, we use 43 gravitational-wave sources from the Third LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) and 1590 light curves from Pantheon+ compilation to constrain the dark energy models, as an attempt to achieve precise late-Universe cosmological constraints. For the dark siren GW event, we estimate the corresponding redshift using the binary black hole redshift distribution model. The combination of GW and SNe Ia data could provide the precision on the Hubble constant H0 and the present matter density Ωm of approximately 16% and 8% for the ΛCDM model. If we consider the equation of state of dark energy w, the combination sample constrains the precision of w to approximately 24%. Although the combination of GWs and SNe Ia observations effectively breaks degeneracies among various cosmological parameters, yielding more stringent constraints, the precision of these constraints still does not meet the stringent standards required by precision cosmology. However, it is reasonable to anticipate that, in the near future, the joint observations of GWs and SNe Ia will become a powerful tool, particularly in the late Universe, for the precise measurement of cosmological parameters.

<div> 高红移类星体、Fe ii/Mg ii比率、宇宙时钟、铁的丰度、早期宇宙演化
总结:
研究了高红移类星体的Fe ii/Mg ii比率及其在早期宇宙中作为铁和α元素丰度的代理。使用VLT XSHOOTER采集了一组明亮类星体的高质量近红外光谱。结果显示，在z = 1到6.6的广泛红移范围内，Fe ii/Mg ii比率没有显著的演化。这一结果支持了之前的研究结果，表明在高红移时期，超大质量黑洞周围的铁快速富集。 <div>
The Fe ii/Mg ii emission line flux ratio in quasar spectra serves as a proxy for the relative Fe to α-element abundances in the broad-line regions of quasars. Due to the expected different enrichment timescales of the two elements, they can be used as a cosmic clock in the early Universe. We present a study of the Fe ii/Mg ii ratios in a sample of luminous quasars exploiting high-quality near-IR spectra taken primarily by the XQR-30 program with VLT XSHOOTER. These quasars have a median bolometric luminosity of log(Lbol[erg s−1]) ∼ 47.3 and cover a redshift range of z = 6.0–6.6. The median value of the measured Fe ii/Mg ii ratios is ∼7.9 with a normalized median absolute deviation of ∼2.2. In order to trace the cosmic evolution of Fe ii/Mg ii in an unbiased manner, we select two comparison samples of quasars with similar luminosities and high-quality spectra from the literature, one at intermediate redshifts (z = 3.5–4.8) and the other at low redshifts (z = 1.0–2.0). We perform the same spectral analysis for all these quasars, including the usage of the same iron template, the same spectral fitting method, and the same wavelength fitting windows. We find no significant redshift evolution in the Fe ii/Mg ii ratio over the wide redshift range from z = 1 to 6.6. The result is consistent with previous studies and supports the scenario of a rapid iron enrichment in the vicinity of accreting supermassive black holes at high redshift.

总结: 
镧系元素的准确原子结构和波长依赖的不透明度高度不确定，这导致在建模短暂事件如光新星和估算质量、特征速度和重金属含量等关键性质时出现系统误差。研究量化了来自文献各处的原子数据以及r过程放射性衰变加热的热化效率选择对光新星光谱的影响。研究结果表明，原子数据的差异对估算镧系物质质量分数有显著影响，质量估算通常相差25%至40%。 选择热化效率也可能对质量估计产生20%至50%的影响。观测性质如颜色和衰变速率高度依赖于模型。速度估计在仅基于光变曲线拟合时，典型误差约为100%。轻r过程元素的原子数据可能强烈影响蓝色发射。即使是像GW170817这样观测良好的事件，使用不同的原子数据集估算的总镧系产量可能相差约6倍。 <br /><br /> <div>
The precise atomic structure and therefore the wavelength-dependent opacities of lanthanides are highly uncertain. This uncertainty introduces systematic errors in modeling transients like kilonovae and estimating key properties such as mass, characteristic velocity, and heavy metal content. Here, we quantify how atomic data from across the literature as well as choices of thermalization efficiency of r-process radioactive decay heating impact the light curve and spectra of kilonovae. Specifically, we analyze the spectra of a grid of models produced by the radiative transfer code Sedona that span the expected range of kilonova properties to identify regions with the highest systematic uncertainty. Our findings indicate that differences in atomic data have a substantial impact on estimates of lanthanide mass fraction, spanning approximately 1 order of magnitude for lanthanide-rich ejecta, and demonstrate the difficulty in precisely measuring the lanthanide fraction in lanthanide-poor ejecta. Mass estimates vary typically by 25%–40% for differing atomic data. Similarly, the choice of thermalization efficiency can affect mass estimates by 20%–50%. Observational properties such as color and decay rate are highly model dependent. Velocity estimation, when fitting solely based on the light curve, can have a typical error of ∼100%. Atomic data of light r-process elements can strongly affect blue emission. Even for well-observed events like GW170817, the total lanthanide production estimated using different atomic data sets can vary by a factor of ∼6.

<div> 辐射压力, 硅酸盐, 铁含量, 凝结距离, 颗粒聚集

总结:
辐射传输计算显示，不含铁的硅酸盐可以在恒星附近凝结，但通常缺乏足够的不透明度推动气流，除非颗粒足够大，以至于散射引起的辐射压力显著。含铁硅酸盐具有更高的吸收不透明度，但由于吸收更强，其预期凝结位置远远超出了预期的尘埃形成区。最近的研究表明，SiO的冷凝生长效率较低，这意味着成核可能持续更长时间，产生更多更小的初生颗粒，增加了在这些气流中颗粒聚集的可能性。通过聚集成分形聚集物，我们研究了辐射压力随着这些初生颗粒聚集的变化。使用镁铝橄榄石和天文硅酸盐的光学特性进行不同数量（最高256个）初生颗粒和不同分形维度（1.8和2.8）的组合进行不透明度计算。对于半径小于0.1μm的初生颗粒，聚集导致辐射压力增强，超过了等效孤立初生颗粒的结果。 <div>
There is still considerable debate on the exact composition of grains formed in the outflows of O-rich, asymptotic giant branch stars. Estimates of the expected condensation distances based on radiative transfer calculations show that iron-free silicates can condense close to the star but typically lack the opacity to drive an outflow unless they are large enough that radiation pressure due to scattering on the grains becomes significant. Iron-containing silicates have a much higher absorption opacity, but due to this stronger absorption, their expected condensation location is well beyond the expected dust formation zone. Recent measurements of the efficiency of SiO condensational growth have shown that this rate is low. The result of this low growth efficiency is that nucleation may persist for longer, giving a larger number of smaller primary particles, leading to an increased likelihood of particle aggregation in these outflows. In this work, we examine how the radiation pressure changes with the possible aggregation of these primary particles into fractal aggregates. Opacity calculations are made using optical properties of both forsterite and astronomical silicate for aggregates containing up to 256 primary particles and for fractal dimensions of 1.8 and 2.8. For primary particles of radius less than ∼0.1 μm, aggregation leads to an enhancement of the radiation pressure over an equivalent cloud of isolated primary particles.

This study employs magnetograms from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Michelson Doppler Imager and Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager to measure the tilt angles of 11,373 sunspot groups over the period from 2008 to 2023. This comprehensive analysis examines the relationship between the tilt angle and latitude of the sunspot groups, as well as the correlation between the tilt angle and solar cycle strength. The methodology involves calculating tilt angles within the ±45° central meridian distance, comparing mean-based and median-based measurements, and applying specific angular separation criteria. The findings reveal that during solar cycle 24, the tilt angles increase by approximately 4° for every 10° increase in latitude, in line with Joy’s law. A significant anticorrelation is observed between the latitude-normalized tilt angle (γ/∣L∣) and solar cycle strength. The research also uncovers a substantial hemispheric asymmetry in tilt angle parameters, with the southern hemisphere (mJoy: 0.23 ± 0.092 ∼ 0.24 ± 0.074, γ = 8.°14 ± 0.°43 ∼ 9.°04 ± 0.°486) consistently showing larger tilt angles than the northern hemisphere (mJoy: 0.47 ± 0.096 ∼ 0.51 ± 0.062, γ = 6.°14 ± 0.°304 ∼ 6.°64 ± 0.°334).

<div> 关键词: 磁通量、太阳磁场、数值模拟、磁扭曲、活跃区域
总结:
太阳深对流区的磁通量的出现对太阳磁活动起着重要作用，研究表明磁扭曲对磁通量的出现有一定影响。研究使用了R2D2代码进行了数值模拟，通过系统性地调研了初始磁扭曲。结果表明，无论初始的扭曲如何，磁通量都会被上升并在光球层形成太阳黑子。然而，当扭曲太弱时，光球层的磁通很快就会扩散并不能长期保持成为连贯的太阳黑子。磁扭曲在光球层的度量相对较好，并与太阳观察结果相当。总而言之，超过了扭曲临界值的情况下，发现磁螺旋度相对于总磁通量来说是不合理的大，这意味着扭曲不太可能是太阳耀斑产生活跃区域的一个典型情形。 <div>
The emergence of magnetic flux from the deep convection zone plays an important role in solar magnetism, such as the generation of active regions and triggering of various eruptive phenomena, including jets, flares, and coronal mass ejections. To investigate the effects of magnetic twist on flux emergence, we performed numerical simulations of flux tube emergence using the radiative magnetohydrodynamic code R2D2 and conducted a systematic survey on the initial twist. Specifically, we varied the twist of the initial tube both positively and negatively from zero to twice the critical value for kink instability. As a result, regardless of the initial twist, the flux tube was lifted by the convective upflow and reached the photosphere to create sunspots. However, when the twist was too weak, the photospheric flux was quickly diffused and not retained long as coherent sunspots. The degree of magnetic twist measured in the photosphere conserved the original twist relatively well and was comparable to actual solar observations. Even in the untwisted case, a finite amount of magnetic helicity was injected into the upper atmosphere because the background turbulence added helicity. However, when the initial twist exceeded the critical value for kink instability, the magnetic helicity normalized by the total magnetic flux was found to be unreasonably larger than the observations, indicating that the kink instability of the emerging flux tube may not be a likely scenario for the formation of flare-productive active regions.

We simulate mergers between star clusters embedded within their natal giant molecular cloud. We extract initial conditions from cloud-scale simulations of cluster formation and introduce different prescriptions for primordial binaries. We find that simulations that do not include primordial binaries result in a larger fraction of unbound stars than simulations that include a prescription for binaries based on observations. We also find a preferred direction of motion for stars that become unbound during the merger. Subcluster mergers within realistic gas environments promote binary disruption, while mergers between idealized, gas-rich spherical clusters do not produce the same disruption. Binary systems with smaller semimajor axes are disrupted in simulations of subcluster mergers within their natal environment compared to simulations that do not include the realistic gas environment. We conclude that binary disruption and the production of an anisotropic distribution of unbound stars are the natural consequences of subcluster mergers during star cluster assembly.

<title>A Data-driven Magnetohydrodynamic Simulation of the 2011 February 15 Coronal Mass Ejection from Active Region NOAA 11158</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a boundary data-driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of the 2011 February 15 coronal mass ejection (CME) event of Active Region NOAA 11158. The simulation is driven at the lower boundary with an electric field derived from the normal magnetic field and the vertical electric current measured from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Helioseismic Magnetic Imager vector magnetograms. The simulation shows the buildup of a pre-eruption coronal magnetic field that is close to the nonlinear force-free field extrapolation, and it subsequently develops multiple eruptions. The sheared/twisted field lines of the pre-eruption magnetic field show qualitative agreement with the brightening loops in the SDO Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) hot passband images. We find that the eruption is initiated by the tether-cutting reconnection in a highly sheared field above the central polarity inversion line and a magnetic flux rope with dipped field lines forms during the eruption. The modeled erupting magnetic field evolves to develop a complex structure containing two distinct flux ropes and produces an outgoing double-shell feature consistent with the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory B/Extreme UltraViolet Imager observation of the CME. The foot points of the erupting field lines are found to correspond well with the dimming regions seen in the SDO/AIA observation of the event. These agreements suggest that the derived electric field is a promising way to drive MHD simulations to establish the realistic pre-eruption coronal field based on the observed vertical electric current and model its subsequent dynamic eruption.

<title>The Challenge of Predicting the Solar Wind Speed near Sunspot Minimum</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
By applying potential-field source-surface and potential-field current-sheet extrapolations to photospheric field maps from three different observatories, we predict the solar wind speed at Earth for several Carrington rotations during 2018–2021 and compare the results with in situ observations. The predicted speeds are taken to be inversely correlated with the rate of flux-tube expansion inside the source surface, located at a heliocentric distance of 2.5 R⊙. The results often differ markedly from one observatory to another and are very sensitive to the latitudinal position of the ecliptic relative to the narrow belt of slow wind that surrounds the source-surface neutral line. Our main conclusions are that (1) the magnetograph measurements themselves are a major source of uncertainty in solar wind predictions; (2) these uncertainties are especially large near solar minimum, when Earth is located near the rapid transition between slow and fast wind that occurs on either side of the heliospheric current sheet; (3) comparison of the derived open field regions with observed coronal holes provides a strong, underutilized constraint on wind speed predictions; and (4) the observed polarity of the interplanetary magnetic field provides another important constraint on the location of the source region.

<title>Formation of Jupiter-mass Binary Objects through Photoerosion of Fragmenting Cores</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The recent discovery of tens of Jupiter-mass binary objects (JuMBOs) in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) with the James Webb Space Telescope has intensified the debate on the origin of free-floating planetary mass objects within star-forming regions. The JuMBOs have masses below the opacity limit for fragmentation but have very wide separations (from tens to hundreds of astronomical units), suggesting that they did not form in a similar manner to other substellar mass binaries. Here, we propose that the theory of photoerosion of prestellar cores by Lyman continuum radiation from massive stars could explain the JuMBOs in the ONC. We find that for a range of gas densities the final substellar mass is comfortably within the JuMBO mass range, and the separations of the JuMBOs are consistent with those of more massive (G- and A-type) binaries, which would have formed from the fragmentation of the cores had they not been photoeroded. The photoerosion mechanism is most effective within the H ii region(s) driven by the massive star(s). The majority of the observed JuMBOs lie outside of these regions in the ONC, but they may have formed within them and then subsequently migrated due to dynamical evolution.

We use simulated galaxy observations from the NIHAO-SKIRT-Catalog to test the accuracy of spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling techniques. SED modeling is an essential tool for inferring star formation histories from nearby galaxy observations but is fraught with difficulty due to our incomplete understanding of stellar populations, chemical enrichment processes, and the nonlinear, geometry-dependent effects of dust. The NIHAO-SKIRT-Catalog uses hydrodynamic simulations and radiative transfer to produce SEDs from the ultraviolet (UV) through the infrared (IR), accounting for dust. We use the commonly used Prospector software to perform inference on these SEDs and compare the inferred stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs) to the known values in the simulation. We match the stellar population models to isolate the effects of differences in the star formation history, the chemical evolution history, and the dust. For the high-mass NIHAO galaxies (>109.5M⊙), we find that model mismatches lead to inferred SFRs that are on average underestimated by a factor of 2 when fit to UV through IR photometry, and a factor of 3 when fit to UV through optical photometry. These biases lead to significant inaccuracies in the resulting specific SFR–mass relations, with UV through optical fits showing particularly strong deviations from the true relation of the simulated galaxies. In the context of massive existing and upcoming photometric surveys, these results highlight that star formation history inference from photometry may remain imprecise and inaccurate and that there is a pressing need for more realistic testing of existing techniques.

Recent numerical simulations have shown that the unstable disk within the central regime of the primordial gas cloud fragments to form multiple protostars on several scales. Their evolution depends on the mass accretion phenomenon, interaction with the surrounding medium and radiative feedback respectively. In this work, we use a fast semianalytical framework in order to model multiple protostars within a rotating cloud, where the mass accretion is estimated via a Bondi–Hoyle flow and the feedback process is approximated through radiation pressure. We observe that while some of the evolving protostars possibly grow massive (≈1–75 M⊙) via accretion and mergers, a fraction of them (≈20%) are likely to be ejected from the parent cloud with a mass corresponding to M* ≲ 0.8 M⊙. These low-mass protostars may be considered as the potential candidates to enter the zero-age-main-sequence phase and possibly survive until the present epoch.

Gravitational wave searches are crucial for studying compact sources such as neutron stars and black holes. Many sensitive modeled searches use matched filtering to compare gravitational strain data to a set of waveform models known as template banks. We introduce a new stochastic placement method for constructing template banks, offering efficiency and flexibility to handle arbitrary parameter spaces, including orbital eccentricity, tidal deformability, and other extrinsic parameters. This method can be computationally limited by the ability to compare proposal templates with the accepted templates in the bank. To alleviate this computational load, we introduce the use of inner product inequalities to reduce the number of required comparisons. We also introduce a novel application of Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation to enhance waveform coverage in sparser regions. Our approach has been employed to search for eccentric binary neutron stars, low-mass neutron stars, primordial black holes, and supermassive black hole binaries. We demonstrate that our method produces self-consistent banks that recover the required minimum fraction of signals. For common parameter spaces, our method shows comparable computational performance and similar template bank sizes to geometric placement methods and stochastic methods, while easily extending to higher-dimensional problems. The time to run a search exceeds the time to generate the bank by a factor of for dedicated template banks, such as geometric, mass-only stochastic, and aligned spin cases, for eccentric and for the tidal deformable bank. With the advent of efficient template bank generation, the primary area for improvement is developing more efficient search methodologies.

We present the analysis of 200 ks NuSTAR observation of the Vela pulsar and the pulsar wind nebula (PWN). The phase-resolved spectra corresponding to two main peaks in the folded pulse profile differ significantly. The spectrum of Peak 1 is significantly harder than that of Peak 2 in qualitative agreement with the earlier Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer results. However, for both spectra, the values of power-law (PL) fit photon indices, Γ, are noticeably larger than the previously reported values. The harder (Peak 1) spectrum has Γ = 1.10 ± 0.15, which is close to those measured for the bright inner jets of the PWN. We used the off-pulse interval to remove the emission from the pulsar and measure the compact PWN spectrum in hard X-rays. We also measured the spectrum from the southwestern region of the PWN, which is resolved by NuSTAR from the compact PWN. For both regions, we fit the NuSTAR spectra by themselves and together with the Chandra X-ray Observatory spectra. We found that the PWN spectrum (for both regions) requires a more complex model than a simple PL. The fits to compact PWN spectrum favor an exponentially cutoff PL model, with Ec ≈ 50 keV over the broken PL model. The observed synchrotron photon energies imply electrons accelerated to ≈150 TeV.

Studies of surface brightness (SB) fluctuations in the intracluster medium present an indirect estimate of turbulent pressure support and associated Mach numbers. While high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy can directly constrain line-of-sight gas motions, including those due to turbulence, such observations are relatively expensive and will be limited to nearby, bright clusters. In this respect, SB fluctuations are the most economical means to constrain turbulent motions at large cluster radii across a range of redshifts and masses. To forecast what current and future X-ray and Sunyaev–Zel’dovich facilities may achieve in SB fluctuation studies, I review and synthesize matters of accuracy and precision with respect to calculating power spectra of SB fluctuations, from which turbulent properties are derived. Balancing concerns of power spectrum accuracy and precision across a range of spatial scales, I propose the use of three annuli with [0, 0.4]R500, [0.4, 1]R500, and [1, 1.5]R500. Adopting these three regions, I calculate the uncertainty in the hydrostatic mass bias, , that can be achieved for various instruments in several scenarios. I find that Lynx and AtLAST are competitive in their constraints at R500, while AtLAST should perform better when constraining at R200.

The C iv doublet in the UV has long been associated with accretion in T Tauri stars. However, it is still unclear where and how the lines are formed. Here, we present a new C iv line model based on the currently available accretion shock and accretion flow models. We assume axisymmetric, dipolar accretion flows with different energy fluxes and calculate the properties of the accretion shock. We use Cloudy to obtain the carbon level populations and calculate the emerging line profiles assuming a plane-parallel geometry near the shock. Our model generally reproduces the intensities and shapes of the C iv emission lines observed from T Tauri stars. We find that the narrow component is optically thin and originates in the postshock, while the broad component is optically thick and emerges from the preshock. We apply our model to seven T Tauri stars from the Hubble Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards Director’s Discretionary program (ULLYSES), for which the consistently determined accretion shock properties are available. We can reproduce the observations of four stars, finding that the accretion flows are carbon-depleted. We also find that the chromospheric emission accounts for less than 10% of the observed C iv line flux in accreting T Tauri stars. This work paves the way toward a better understanding of hot line formation and provides a potential probe of abundances in the inner disk.

A common envelope (CE) is proposed as the origin of the early post-outburst spectra of many novae. A simple model is proposed to explain the properties of the CE based on the emission line strengths and an assumed density distribution. Rapid changes in the spectrum during post-outburst decline are suggested as possible evidence for a CE. Time-resolved spectra from the ARAS group show sudden spectral shifts that are correlated with detected γ-ray emission, suggestive of its possible origin on the white dwarf that produces a change in condition within the CE. Episodic mass loss, formation of transient heavy element absorption systems, and dissipation of the CE may possibly be triggered by γ-ray emission.

Understanding the nature of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) is crucial for probing their underlying physics. In this work, we analyze the waiting time statistics between bursts of three repeating FRBs from four data sets. We find a universally pronounced dependency of the waiting times on the previous time interval (denoted as λ0). We observe a temporal clustering, where short waiting times tend to be followed by short ones and long by long, comparative to their mean value. This memory dependency is manifested in the conditional mean waiting time as well as in the conditional mean residual time to the next burst, both of which increase in direct proportion to λ0. Consequently, the likelihood of experiencing a subsequent FRB burst within a given time window after the preceding burst is generally influenced by the burst history. We reveal, for the first time, that these memory effects are present in the scale-invariant preconditioned waiting time distribution. We show that the memory effect provides a unified description of waiting times that may account for both the repeating FRBs and the apparently nonrepeating FRBs (i.e., those only observed one time). These results shed new light on the mechanism of FRBs.

总结: 
这篇文章报告了对高同步辐射峰(HSP)类星体Mrk 421的X射线和光学偏振测量的观测结果。他们使用IXPE进行了X射线偏振观测，并在同一时间进行了光学偏振观测。结果显示，X射线和光学波段都检测到了偏振信号，而且发现随着能量的降低，偏振程度逐渐减小。研究人员认为这支持了一个假设，即偏振程度变化的原因可能是不同辐射区域的空间延伸差异。同时，他们还通过对X射线和光学数据进行宽带能谱能量分布建模来支持这一假设。这些结果对于理解HSP类星体的辐射机制提供了宝贵信息。 <br /><br /> <div>
We present near-simultaneous X-ray and optical polarization measurements in the high synchrotron peaked (HSP) blazar Mrk 421. The X-ray polarimetric observations were carried out using Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) on 2023 December 6. During IXPE observations, we also carried out optical polarimetric observations using 104 cm Sampurnanand telescope at Nainital and multiband optical imaging observations using 2 m Himalayan Chandra Telescope at Hanle. From model-independent analysis of IXPE data, we detected X-ray polarization with degree of polarization (ΠX) of 8.5% ± 0.5% and an electric vector position angle (ΨX) of 10.°6 ± 1.°7 in the 2−8 keV band. From optical polarimetry on 2023 December 6, in B, V, and R bands, we found values of ΠB = 4.27% ± 0.32%, ΠV = 3.57% ± 0.31%, and ΠR = 3.13% ± 0.25%. The value of ΠB is greater than that observed at longer optical wavelengths, with the degree of polarization suggesting an energy-dependent trend, gradually decreasing from higher to lower energies. This is consistent with that seen in other HSP blazars and favors a stratified emission region encompassing a shock front. The emission happening in the vicinity of the shock front will be more polarized due to the ordered magnetic field resulting from shock compression. The X-ray emission, involving high-energy electrons, originates closer to the shock front than the optical emission. The difference in the spatial extension could plausibly account for the observed variation in polarization between X-ray and optical wavelengths. This hypothesis is further supported by the broadband spectral energy distribution modeling of the X-ray and optical data.

<div> 关键词: JWST, SN Ia, 光谱分析, 铁类星云, 白矮星<br />
总结: <br />
这篇文章使用JWST MIRI中分辨率光谱仪对SN 2021aefx进行了观测，并结合之前的观测数据，进行了第一次JWST时间序列分析。通过对[Co iii] 11.888 μm特征的分析追踪了56Co的衰变。作者分析了光谱、线型和其演化，并使用偏心延迟爆炸模型进行了拟合。他们发现最佳拟合为白矮星中心密度ρc = 0.9−1.1 × 109 g cm−3，白矮星质量MWD = 1.33–1.35 M⊙，白矮星磁场≈106 G，以及一个约0.5 M⊙的偏心爆燃模型。文章还讨论了电子俘获核心和正电子沉积的影响，以及对光谱特征的改变。最后，分析显示这次超新星爆发是由单个点近中心点燃，排除了多点偏离中心的点燃模型。 <div>
We present a JWST MIRI medium-resolution spectrometer spectrum (5–27 μm) of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2021aefx at +415 days past B-band maximum. The spectrum, which was obtained during the iron-dominated nebular phase, has been analyzed in combination with previous JWST observations of SN 2021aefx to provide the first JWST time series analysis of an SN Ia. We find that the temporal evolution of the [Co iii] 11.888 μm feature directly traces the decay of 56Co. The spectra, line profiles, and their evolution are analyzed with off-center delayed-detonation models. Best fits were obtained with white dwarf (WD) central densities of ρc = 0.9−1.1 × 109 g cm−3, a WD mass of MWD = 1.33–1.35 M⊙, a WD magnetic field of ≈106 G, and an off-center deflagration-to-detonation transition at ≈0.5 M⊙ seen opposite to the line of sight of the observer (−30°). The inner electron capture core is dominated by energy deposition from γ-rays, whereas a broader region is dominated by positron deposition, placing SN 2021aefx at +415 days in the transitional phase of the evolution to the positron-dominated regime. The formerly “flat-tilted” profile at 9 μm now has a significant contribution from [Ni iv], [Fe ii], and [Fe iii] and less from [Ar iii], which alters the shape of the feature as positrons mostly excite the low-velocity Ar. Overall, the strength of the stable Ni features in the spectrum is dominated by positron transport rather than the Ni mass. Based on multidimensional models, our analysis is consistent with a single-spot, close-to-central ignition with an indication of a preexisting turbulent velocity field and excludes a multiple-spot, off-center ignition.

本研究基于事件视界望远镜观测到的M87*图像，提出了一种构建多种不同偏好的先验的框架。这些先验可以是弱先验（仅强调基本自然图像统计）或强先验（对黑洞结构做出假设）。该框架使用基于得分的先验的贝叶斯推断，这些先验源自于可以学习复杂图像分布的深度生成模型。借助我们的贝叶斯成像方法和复杂的数据驱动先验，我们可以评估重建图像的视觉特征和不确定性，以及它们如何取决于先验的选择。除了模拟数据外，我们还对真实的EHT M87*数据进行了图像重建，并讨论了选择先验如何影响恢复的特征。 <br /><br />总结: <br />该研究提出了一种灵活设计不同偏好的图像重建先验的框架，使用贝叶斯推断和数据驱动的先验技术对黑洞图像进行重建，并讨论了先验选择对重建图像的影响。 <div>
Reconstructing images from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87, depends on a prior to impose desired image statistics. However, given the impossibility of directly observing black holes, there is no clear choice for a prior. We present a framework for flexibly designing a range of priors, each bringing different biases to the image reconstruction. These priors can be weak (e.g., impose only basic natural-image statistics) or strong (e.g., impose assumptions of black hole structure). Our framework uses Bayesian inference with score-based priors, which are data-driven priors arising from a deep generative model that can learn complicated image distributions. Using our Bayesian imaging approach with sophisticated data-driven priors, we can assess how visual features and uncertainty of reconstructed images change depending on the prior. In addition to simulated data, we image the real EHT M87* data and discuss how recovered features are influenced by the choice of prior.

这篇文章研究了TeV J2032+4130，一个高能γ射线源，发现它实际上是一个脉冲星风星雲，由PSR J2032+4127驱动。研究发现HAWC J2031+415其实是一个γ射线双星系统，包含脉冲星PSR J2032+4127和其伴星MT91 213。研究团队结合了射电、X射线和γ射线的数据进行了多波段分析，最终确认了这一发现。2017年他们也观测到了这一系统的近日点。总结: 这项研究确认了TeV J2032+4130源实际上是由PSR J2032+4127驱动的脉冲星风星雲，而HAWC J2031+415是一个γ射线双星系统，这一发现得到了多波段数据的验证。 <div>
The first TeV γ-ray source with no lower energy counterparts, TeV J2032+4130, was discovered by HEGRA. It appears in the third HAWC catalog as 3HWC J2031+415 and it is a bright TeV γ-ray source whose emission has previously been resolved as two sources: HAWC J2031+415 and HAWC J2030+409. While HAWC J2030+409 has since been associated with the Fermi Large Area Telescope Cygnus Cocoon, no such association for HAWC J2031+415 has yet been found. In this work, we investigate the spectrum and energy-dependent morphology of HAWC J2031+415. We associate HAWC J2031+415 with a γ-ray binary system containing the pulsar PSR J2032+4127 and its companion MT91 213. We study HAWC data to observe their periastron in 2017. Additionally, we perform a combined multiwavelength analysis using radio, X-ray, and γ-ray emission. We conclude that HAWC J2031+415 and, by extension, TeV J2032+4130 are most probably a pulsar wind nebula powered by PSR J2032+4127.

<br />
黑洞候选者Swift J1727.8-1613是近期发现的一个明亮的瞬变物体，利用NICER和NuSTAR联合数据，研究了其在0.5-79 keV的广泛能量范围内的特性。在0.5-10 keV的NICER数据中观察到了0.89±0.01 Hz的显著C型准周期振荡（QPO）及其谐波。有趣的是，在更低的能量范围内，谐波变得较弱（0.5-1和1-3 keV）。同时，在NICER / X射线定时仪观测中首次发现了硬（3-10 keV）和软（0.5-3 keV）波段光子之间在QPO频率处的软时间滞后为0.014±0.001 s。这表明该双星系统中的吸积盘倾斜角可能较高。从详细的能谱分析中，使用relxill反射模型发现了源的盘倾斜角约为85°。文章讨论了通过能谱分析得出的吸积流配置如何帮助我们理解此源中QPO和软滞后的起源。<br /><br />总结：黑洞候选者Swift J1727.8-1613在0.5-79 keV的广泛能量范围内观测到了C型准周期振荡和其谐波，以及硬和软光子之间的软时间滞后，这表明了源的盘倾斜角可能较高。能谱分析揭示了吸积流配置，有助于我们理解QPO和软滞后的来源。 <div>
The recently discovered bright transient black hole candidate Swift J1727.8-1613 is studied in a broad energy range (0.5–79 keV) using combined NICER and NuSTAR data taken on 2023 August 29. A prominent type C quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) at 0.89 ± 0.01 Hz with its harmonic was observed in NICER data of 0.5–10 keV. Interestingly, the harmonic becomes weaker in the lower energy bands (0.5–1 and 1–3 keV). We also report the first detection of a soft time lag of 0.014 ± 0.001 s at the QPO frequency between harder (3–10 keV) and softer (0.5–3 keV) band photons observed with the NICER/X-ray timing instrument. This indicates that the inclination of the accretion disk in the binary system might be high. From the detailed spectral analysis with the relxill reflection model, we found the disk inclination angle of the source to be ∼85°. We discuss how the accretion flow configuration inferred from spectral analysis can help us understand the origin of QPOs and soft lag in this source.

总结:<br />
文章利用交叉相关技术推断宇宙的哈勃常数(H0)，使用来自第三个GW瞬变目录(GWTC-3)和光度星系调查2MPZ、WISE-SuperCOSMOS的引力波(GW)源暗信号(暗灵音)，并结合来自GW170817的明亮灵音测量的H0。只使用暗灵音的H0后验因为定位良好的GW源数量较少而信息含量不足。使用八个定位良好的暗灵音和具有电磁对应的双中子星GW170817，经过边缘化处理，在物质密度和GW偏差参数上获得H0的值为 km s−1 Mpc−1 (中值和68.3%的双尾区间)。这一测量主要受明亮灵音测量的影响，暗灵音的任何约束都没有统计学显著性。未来，随着更多定位良好的GW事件，对宇宙膨胀历史的约束将会得到改善。 <div>
We apply the cross-correlation technique to infer the Hubble constant (H0) of the Universe using gravitational-wave (GW) sources without electromagnetic counterparts (dark sirens) from the third GW Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) and the photometric galaxy surveys 2MPZ and WISE-SuperCOSMOS, and combine these with the bright siren measurement of H0 from GW170817. The posterior on H0 with only dark sirens is uninformative due to the small number of well-localized GW sources. Using the eight well-localized dark sirens and the binary neutron star GW170817 with electromagnetic counterpart, we obtain a value of the Hubble constant km s−1 Mpc−1 (median and 68.3% equal-tailed interval) after marginalizing over the matter density and the GW bias parameters. This measurement is mostly driven by the bright siren measurement, and any constraint from dark sirens is not statistically significant. In the future, with more well-localized GW events, the constraints on expansion history will improve.

It has been widely accepted that mass-accreting white dwarfs (WDs) are the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe) or electron-capture supernovae. Previous work has shown that the accretion rate could affect the elemental abundance on the outer layers of CO WDs, and therefore affect the observational characteristics after they exploded as SNe Ia. However, it has not been well studied how elemental abundance changes on the outer layers of He-accreting ONe WDs as they approach the Chandrasekhar mass limit. In this paper, we investigated the evolution of He-accreting ONe WDs with MESA. We found that a CO-rich mantle will accumulate beneath the He layers resulting from the He burning, after which the ignition of the CO-rich mantle could transform carbon into silicon (Si). The amount of Si produced by carbon burning is strongly anticorrelated with the accretion rate. As the ONe WD nearly approaches the Chandrasekhar mass limit (Mch) through accretion, it is likely to undergo accretion-induced collapse, resulting in the formation of a neutron star.

M-type stars are the most abundant stars in our Galaxy. Their visible spectra are characterized by strong TiO and VO absorption bands with occasional ScO bands near 6000–6100 Å. This region corresponds to the A2Π–X2Σ+ band system and can be used to measure the abundance of ScO. In this work, a new Doppler-limited resolution spectrum of ScO obtained in a hollow-cathode experiment is presented. The A2Π–X2Σ+ electronic transition is analyzed with special care dedicated to fitting the ∼ A2Π(v) perturbation. Spectroscopic constants of the A2Π(v) states are reported for v ≤ 9, and a partial fit of spectroscopic constants is made for the states 2 ≤ v ≤ 6. The modeled interaction of the two states reproduces the experimental data remarkably well. New equilibrium constants are extracted from the fit. Band strengths are calculated with the help of a scaled transition dipole moment function, previously calculated with ab initio methods. Finally, a line list of the A2Π–X2Σ+ band system is provided, including Einstein A coefficients and oscillator strengths. Using this line list, the spectrum of ScO can be simulated for different temperature and pressure conditions in stellar atmospheres.

总结:
JWST TEMPLATES Early Release Science program使用了两个通过引力透镜效应得到的星系的综合光谱，分析了微弱的光谱线，从而直接测量了气相化学丰度。对亮的星系SGAS1723+34 (z = 1.3293)检测到了[O iii] λ4363, [S iii] λ6312, 和[O ii] λλ7320, 7330的发射线，并设定了[N ii] λ5755的上限。对第二个星系SGAS1226+21 (z = 2.925)，没有检测到任何的光谱线，报告了上限。利用这些测量和上限，对这两个星系的不同电离区域内的电子温度进行了限制。对于检测到光谱线的SGAS1723+34星系，计算了直接的氧和氮的丰度，发现了与附近星系观测（z∼0）一致的N/O比值。这些观测凸显了JWST和引力透镜的强大结合，用于测量远距离星系中微弱的发射线，并直接研究这些星系中的化学丰度模式。 <div>
Using integrated spectra for two gravitationally lensed galaxies from the JWST TEMPLATES Early Release Science program, we analyze faint auroral lines, which provide direct measurements of the gas-phase chemical abundance. For the brighter galaxy, SGAS1723+34 (z = 1.3293), we detect the [O iii] λ4363, [S iii] λ6312, and [O ii] λλ7320, 7330 auroral emission lines, and set an upper limit for the [N ii] λ5755 line. For the second galaxy, SGAS1226+21 (z = 2.925), we do not detect any auroral lines, and report upper limits. With these measurements and upper limits, we constrain the electron temperatures in different ionization zones within both of these galaxies. For SGAS1723+34, where auroral lines are detected, we calculate direct oxygen and nitrogen abundances, finding an N/O ratio consistent with observations of nearby (z ∼ 0) galaxies. These observations highlight the potent combination of JWST and gravitational lensing to measure faint emission lines in individual distant galaxies and to directly study the chemical abundance patterns in those galaxies.

Pulse profile modeling (PPM), the technique used to infer mass, radius, and geometric parameters for rotation-powered millisecond pulsars using data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), relies on relativistic ray-tracing of thermal X-ray photons from hot spots on the neutron star surface to the observer. To verify our ray-tracing codes we have in the past conducted cross tests for simple hot spot geometries, focusing primarily on the implementation of the spacetime model. In this paper, we present verification for test problems that explore the more complex hot spot geometries that are now being employed in the NICER PPM analyses. We conclude that the accuracy of our computed waveforms is in general sufficiently high for analyses of current NICER data sets. We have however identified some extreme configurations where extra care may be needed.

Superclusters, encompassing environments across a wide range of overdensities, can be regarded as unique laboratories for studying galaxy evolution. Although numerous supercluster catalogs have been published, none of them goes beyond redshift z = 0.7. In this work, we adopt a physically motivated supercluster definition, requiring that superclusters should eventually collapse even in the presence of dark energy. Applying a friends-of-friends (FoF) algorithm to the CAMIRA cluster sample constructed using the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam survey data, we have conducted the first systematic search for superclusters at z = 0.5–1.0 and identified 673 supercluster candidates over an area of 1027 deg2. The FoF algorithm is calibrated by evolving N-body simulations to the far future to ensure high purity. We found that these high-z superclusters are mainly composed of two to four clusters, suggesting the limit of gravitationally bound structures in the younger Universe. In addition, we studied the properties of the clusters and brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) residing in different large-scale environments. We found that clusters associated with superclusters are typically richer, but no apparent dependence of the BCG properties on large-scale structures is found. We also compared the abundance of observed superclusters with mock superclusters extracted from halo light cones, finding that photometric redshift uncertainty is a limiting factor in the performance of superclusters detection.

<div> 关键词: TRGB, Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, 红巨星分支, 确定距离<br />
总结:本文介绍了红巨星分支顶端（TRGB）作为一个可以标准化的蜡烛，用来测量星系的距离。通过使用Hubble Space Telescope和James Webb Space Telescope的近红外摄像头，可以扩展到约50 Mpc的距离范围。此外，文章还提到了通过颜色来校正TRGB的亮度，推荐了适合不同精度要求的滤波器。与此相关的科学研究需要高精度的测量，可以使用特定滤波器对TRGB进行测量，并且远距离需要更长的观测时间。如果可以接受较低的精度或者需要较短的观测时间，还有其他滤波器可供选择。由于分辨率较低，不推荐使用某些滤波器进行精确的TRGB测量。 <div>
The tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) is a standardizable candle, identifiable as the discontinuity at the bright extreme of the red giant branch (RGB) stars in color–magnitude diagram space. The TRGB-based distance method has been used to measure distances to galaxies out to D ≤ 20 Mpc with the Hubble Space Telescope F814W filter, and is an important rung in the distance ladder to measure the Hubble constant, H0. In the infrared (IR), the TRGB apparent magnitude ranges from 1–2 mag brighter than in the optical. Now with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the feasible distance range of the TRGB method can reach ∼50 Mpc. However, the IR TRGB luminosity depends to varying degrees on stellar metallicity/age. Here we standardize the TRGB luminosity using stellar colors as a proxy for metallicity/age to derive color-based corrections for the JWST Near-Infrared Camera short-wavelength filters F090W, F115W, and F150W, and the long-wavelength filters F277W, F356W, and F444W. We provide recommended filters for distance measurements depending on the requisite precision. For science requiring high precision (≤1% in distance), we recommend measuring the TRGB in F090W versus F090W − F150W or F115W versus F115W − F277W with the caveat that even with JWST, long integration times will be necessary at farther distances. If lower precision (>1.5% in distance) can be tolerated, or if shorter integration times are desirable, we recommend measuring the TRGB in either F115W or F150W. We do not recommend F444W for precision TRGB measurements due to its lower angular resolution.

<div> 红移、紫外选取的星系、低质量黑暗物质暗物质晕、紫外光度函数、星际中的物理过程
总结: 通过简单的分析模型，文章探讨了质量相关的随机性对高红移星系的影响。随着暗物质暗物质晕质量的降低，紫外光度函数呈现出增长的趋势，而星系的聚集程度下降。同时，文章强调了星系中星形成的突发性，对离子化光子预算和再电离过程的影响。文章还提出了一些预测，如在固定紫外光度下，星系的紫外斜率、星际发射线强度和巴尔默断裂将呈现宽广的变化范围。研究表明，质量相关的随机性模型成功地复现了观测到的紫外光度函数，但无法匹配观测到的最高红移处的光度函数，这暗示了在最早期的星系中存在其他物理过程增强了星形成效率。 <div>
The James Webb Space Telescope is unveiling a surprising lack of evolution in the number densities of ultraviolet (UV)-selected galaxies at redshift z ≳ 10. At the same time, observations and simulations are providing evidence for highly bursty star formation in high-z galaxies, resulting in significant scatter in their UV luminosities. Galaxies in low-mass dark matter halos are expected to experience most stochasticity due to their shallow potential wells. Here, we explore the impact of a mass-dependent stochasticity using a simple analytical model. We assume that scatter in the MUV–Mh relation increases toward lower halo masses, following the decrease in halo escape velocity, , independent of redshift. Since low-mass halos are more dominant in the early universe, this model naturally predicts an increase in UV luminosity functions (LFs) at high redshifts compared to models without scatter. We make predictions for additional observables, which would be affected by stochasticity and could be used to constrain its amplitude, finding (i) galaxies are less clustered compared to the no-scatter scenario, with the difference increasing at higher-z; (ii) assuming that star-bursting galaxies dominate the ionizing photon budget implies reionization starts earlier and is more gradual compared to the no-scatter case; (iii) at fixed UV magnitude, galaxies should exhibit wide ranges of UV slopes, nebular emission line strengths, and Balmer breaks. Comparing to observations, the mass-dependent stochasticity model successfully reproduces the observed LFs up to z ∼ 12. However, the model cannot match the observed z ∼ 14 LFs, implying additional physical processes enhance star formation efficiency in the earliest galaxies.

总结: <br /><br />这篇文章报道了对黑洞X射线暂现体GX 339-4的光谱-时间分析，使用了AstroSat和NICER的同时观测数据。研究发现，源处于低/硬态，具有光子指数约为1.64。能谱组合包括热盘组分、硬康普顿化组分和带边的反射组分。功率密度谱显示两个显著的特征频率，在0.22赫兹和2.94赫兹附近。能量相关的时间滞后和均方根分数显示硬滞后以及在较高能量水平下的变异性减少。研究还发现，与加速率、内盘半径、冠加热率和散射分数之间相关的变化，以及它们之间的延迟，可以解释所观察的均方根和滞后谱。 <div>
We present a spectro-timing analysis of the black hole X-ray transient GX 339–4 using simultaneous observations from AstroSat and the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) during the 2021 outburst period. The combined spectrum obtained from NICER, Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter and SXT data is effectively described by a model comprising a thermal disk component, hard Comptonization component, and reflection component with an edge. Our analysis of the AstroSat and NICER spectra indicates the source to be in a low/hard state, with a photon index of ∼1.64. The power density spectra obtained from both AstroSat and NICER observations exhibit two prominent broad features at 0.22 Hz and 2.94 Hz. We generated energy-dependent time lag and fractional root mean square (frms) at both frequencies in a broad energy range of 0.5–30 keV and found the presence of hard lags along with a decrease in variability at higher energy levels. Additionally, we discovered that the correlated variations in accretion rate, inner disk radius, coronal heating rate, and the scattering fraction, along with a delay between them, can explain the observed frms and lag spectra for both features.

<div> 星系、星形成、尘埃性质、光谱能量分布、MOSDEF调查
总结:
该研究通过将660个星系分成具有类似光谱能量分布（SEDs）形状的组，进行星系的光度测量和光谱叠加分析。通过该方法，研究包括了具有非常微弱发射线的星系样本，可以利用Prospector模型测量星体衰减和SED-based星形成速率（SFRs），并从光谱叠加中导出发射线特性，包括巴尔默衰减、尘埃校正的SFR和金属丰度。研究发现恒星衰减主要与质量相关，而星云衰减则与质量和SFR都有较强的相关性。此外，高SFR组的星云衰减过剩与SFR最强烈关联，最高SFR组有2等星等的星云衰减过剩。研究结果与一个模型一致，即随着星系质量的增加，星形成区域变得更加多尘。除此之外，随着每个星系组代表不同的演化阶段，研究了它们在UVJ图和SFR-质量图上的位置。随着质量的增加，金属丰度和尘埃衰减增加，而比星形成速率（sSFR）减少。然而，最大质量的组移向UVJ图中宁静区域，同时表现出较少的遮挡，可能表示了尘埃的去除。 <div>
We examine star formation and dust properties for a sample of 660 galaxies at 1.37 ≤ z ≤ 2.61 in the MOSDEF survey by dividing them into groups with similarly shaped spectral energy distributions (SEDs). For each group, we combine the galaxy photometry into a finely sampled composite SED, and stack their spectra. This method enables the study of more complete galaxy samples, including galaxies with very faint emission lines. We fit these composite SEDs with Prospector to measure the stellar attenuation and SED-based star formation rates (SFRs). We also derive emission-line properties from the spectral stacks, including Balmer decrements, dust-corrected SFRs, and metallicities. We find that stellar attenuation correlates most strongly with mass, while nebular attenuation correlates strongly with both mass and SFR. Furthermore, the excess of nebular compared to stellar attenuation correlates most strongly with SFR. The highest SFR group has 2 mag of excess nebular attenuation. Our results are consistent with a model in which star-forming regions become more dusty as galaxy mass increases. To explain the increasing excess nebular attenuation, we require a progressively larger fraction of star formation to occur in highly obscured regions with increasing SFR. This highly obscured star formation could occur in dusty clumps or central starbursts. Additionally, as each galaxy group represents a different evolutionary stage, we study their locations on the UVJ and SFR-mass diagrams. As mass increases, metallicity and dust attenuation increase, while sSFR decreases. However, the most massive group moves towards the quiescent region of the UVJ diagram, while showing less obscuration, potentially indicating removal of dust.

FRB的观测离散度测量（DMs）是沿着传播路径上电离材料数量的良好指标。本文介绍了使用即将到来的Square Kilometre阵列（SKA）的FRB的DM和红移测量来预测He ii 再电离的检测。假设在宇宙模型中He ii 再电离发生在特定红移，我们分析了在SKA时代可以在什么程度上获得再电离振幅检测的信噪比（S/N）。使用来自SKA第二阶段1年观测的106个模拟FRB数据，我们发现用于检测He ii 再电离的S/N可以达到32–50σ水平，并且可以约束再电离红移的不确定性，具体取决于假定的FRB红移分布。这是关于SKA时代He ii 再电离检测重要性的首次定量分析。我们还研究了不同基准值的影响，发现这种影响对预测的影响有限。我们的结果表明SKA时代的FRB具有限制He ii 再电离时代的潜在能力。 <br /><br />总结: FRB的观测离散度测量是沿着传播路径上电离材料数量的良好指标。使用SKA的FRB的DM和红移测量可以预测He ii 再电离的检测。使用模拟FRB数据预测可以在SKA时代获得再电离振幅检测的信噪比（S/N），并且可以约束再电离红移的不确定性。研究还发现不同基准值的影响。我们的结果表明SKA时代的FRB具有限制He ii 再电离时代的潜在能力。 <div>
The observed dispersion measures (DMs) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a good indicator of the amount of ionized material along the propagation paths. In this work, we present a forecast of He ii reionization detection using the DM and redshift measurements of FRBs from the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Assuming a model of the Universe in which He ii reionization occurred at a specific redshift , we analyze what extent the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for the detection of the amplitude of reionization can be achieved in the era of SKA. Using 106 mock FRB data from a 1 year observation of the second phase of SKA, we find that the S/N for detecting He ii reionization can approach the 32–50σ level, and the uncertainty on the reionization redshift can be constrained to be , depending on the assumed FRB redshift distribution. This is the first quantitative analysis on the detection significance of He ii reionization in the SKA era. We also examine the influence of different fiducial values, finding that this effect has a modest impact on the forecasts. Our results demonstrate the potentially remarkable capability of SKA-era FRBs in constraining the epoch of He ii reionization.

Ethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH) has recently been identified in the molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027, situated in the SgrB2 complex in the Galactic center. However, its presence in other regions, and in particular in star-forming sites, is still elusive. Given its likely role as a precursor to simple amino acids, understanding its presence in the star-forming region is required. Here, we present the experimentally obtained temperature-dependent spectral features and morphological behavior of pure ethanolamine ices under astrochemical conditions in the 2–12 μm (MIR) and 120–230 nm (VUV) regions for the first time. These features would help in understanding its photochemical behavior. In addition, we present the first chemical models specifically dedicated to ethanolamine. These models include all the discussed chemical routes from the literature, along with the estimated binding energies and activation energies from quantum chemical calculations reported in this work. We have found that surface reactions CH2OH + NH2CH2 → NH2CH2CH2OH and NH2 + C2H4OH → NH2CH2CH2OH in warmer regions (60–90 K) could play a significant role in the formation of ethanolamine. Our modeled abundance of ethanolamine complements the upper limit of ethanolamine column density estimated in earlier observations in hot core/corino regions. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical estimation of the rotational and distortional constants for various species (such as HNCCO, NH2CHCO, and NH2CH2CO) related to ethanolamine that have not been studied in existing literature. This study could be valuable for identifying these species in the future.

<br /><br />总结:
这篇文章介绍了使用GADGET4-Osaka平滑粒子流体动力学代码执行的新的宇宙学模拟数据集CROCODILE。该模拟包括了Y. Oku等人的更新的超新星（SN）反馈模型以及一个活动星系核（AGN）反馈模型。他们的SN反馈模型的一个关键创新是整合了一个与金属丰度和红移相关的、顶部丰富的初始质量函数。他们发现SN反馈是星系演化中化学丰度的关键驱动因素。另外，AGN反馈会产生富含金属的双极喷流，这些喷流会延伸并丰富几个兆秒差不多的尺度上的星系周围介质和星系间介质。他们进行了多种运行的比较，发现Fiducial运行与观测数据有很好的一致性，尤其是在星系恒星质量函数、星系形成主序和质量-金属丰度关系方面。这些结果为他们未来的工作奠定了坚实的基础。 <div>
We introduce our new cosmological simulation data set CROCODILE, executed using the GADGET4-Osaka smoothed particle hydrodynamics code. This simulation incorporates an updated supernova (SN) feedback model of Y. Oku et al. and an active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback model. A key innovation in our SN feedback model is the integration of a metallicity- and redshift-dependent, top-heavy initial mass function. Our SN model introduces a new consideration that results in an order of magnitude difference in the energy injection rate per unit stellar mass formed at high redshift. The CROCODILE data set is comprehensive, encompassing a variety of runs with diverse feedback parameters. This allows for an in-depth exploration of the relative impacts of different feedback processes in galactic evolution. Our initial comparisons with observational data, spanning the galaxy stellar mass function, the star formation main sequence, and the mass–metallicity relation, show promising agreement, especially for the Fiducial run. These results establish a solid foundation for our future work. We find that SN feedback is a key driver in the chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Additionally, the AGN feedback creates metal-rich, bipolar outflows that extend and enrich the circumgalactic medium and IGM over a few Mpc scales.

总结:<br /><br />这项研究对来自MaNGA Product Launch-11的1624个气质丰富的星系中的非圆形运动进行了系统研究。研究发现，非圆形运动的幅度与恒星质量相关，影响最大的是低质量和后期类型的星系。研究还发现，螺旋臂和恒星棒引起的非圆形运动并不会对Hα示踪的旋转曲线产生太大影响。因此，在样本中，我们并未发现非圆形运动对恒星Tully-Fisher关系的散射贡献很大。我们的结果表明，非圆形运动可能在星系中具有更局部化的影响，而不是全局性的影响。 <div>
Noncircular (NC) motions represent the imprints of nonaxisymmetric structures in galaxies, providing opportunities to study the physical properties of gas departing from circular rotation. In this work, we have conducted a systematic study of the NC motions in a sample of 1624 gas-rich disk galaxies from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (or MaNGA) Product Launch-11. By using the Hα velocity as a tracer of the disk rotation, we find indications that the amplitude of the NC motions is related to the stellar mass, with the low-mass and late-type galaxies the most affected. In our sample, we find ratios of circular to NC rotation ranging from 5% to 20%. By implementing harmonic models to include NC motions associated with spiral arms and stellar bars, we find that the rotational curves traced with Hα are barely affected by the NC motions induced by these structures. Consequently, in our sample, we do not find evidence that NC motions contribute to the scatter of the stellar Tully–Fisher relation. Our results suggest that NC motions might have a more localized effect in galaxies rather than a global one.

<br /><br />总结:
本文利用ALMA对NGC 384进行了CO(2-1)观测，发现其中心区域存在动力学扭曲。研究团队开发了扭曲盘的气体动力学模型并将其与观测数据吻合，发现该星系的H波段恒星质量-光度比为1.34 ± 0.01 [1σ统计] ±0.02 [系统] M⊙/L⊙，超大质量黑洞的质量在一定范围内。而与之前研究相比，NGC 384的结果显示其落在BH质量-星系球光度和BH质量-星系球质量关系的分散范围内。这表明NGC 384及其他局部紧凑星系可能是z∼2的红色小圆球的遗迹，而这些遗迹中超大质量黑洞的过质量化可能意味着黑洞的增长可能早于宿主星系的星群组装。这些发现可能挑战了以往的进化理论，并表明BH质量-星系关系中的分散可能比以前认为的更大。然而，这种分散可能被恒星和气体动力学测量方法之间的系统差异所放大，因此需要对NGC 384和其他局部紧凑星系进行直接比较。 <div>
We present 0.″22 resolution CO(2–1) observations of the circumnuclear gas disk in the local compact galaxy NGC 384 with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). While the majority of the disk displays regular rotation with projected velocities rising to 370 km s−1, the inner ∼0.″5 exhibits a kinematic twist. We develop warped disk gas-dynamical models to account for this twist, fit those models to the ALMA data cube, and find a stellar mass-to-light ratio in the H band of M/LH = 1.34 ± 0.01 [1σ statistical] ±0.02 [systematic] M⊙/L⊙ and a supermassive black hole (BH) mass (MBH) of MBH . In contrast to most previous dynamical MBH measurements in local compact galaxies, which typically found over-massive BHs compared to the local BH mass−bulge luminosity and BH mass−bulge mass relations, NGC 384 lies within the scatter of those scaling relations. NGC 384 and other local compact galaxies are likely relics of z ∼ 2 red nuggets, and over-massive BHs in these relics indicate BH growth may conclude before the host galaxy stars have finished assembly. Our NGC 384 results may challenge this evolutionary picture, suggesting there may be increased scatter in the scaling relations than previously thought. However, this scatter could be inflated by systematic differences between stellar- and gas-dynamical measurement methods, motivating direct comparisons between the methods for NGC 384 and the other compact galaxies in the sample.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a ubiquitous population of dust-obscured compact sources at z ≳ 4. Many of these objects exhibit signs of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, making their study crucial for understanding the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their growth with host galaxies. In this work, we examine low and medium-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectra from the JADES GTO public data release in the GOODS-N field of a red, luminous (MB ∼ −22.2 mag) and compact (<500 pc) source at z = 4.13. The rest-optical (λrest > 4000 Å) continuum of this source is strongly dominated by a massive (log10[M*/M⊙] ∼ 10.6), quenched (log10[sSFR/yr−1] < −11) galaxy, as indicated by the clear presence of a Balmer break and stellar absorption lines. Star formation history modeling reveals a starburst episode followed by rapid quenching about 200 Myr ago. The spectrum shows extremely broad (FWHM ∼2500 km s−1) Hα emission and elevated optical line ratios, indicating an actively accreting SMBH. Moreover, our work has potentially revealed clear AGN signatures in the rest-UV in little red dots for the first time via the detection of a strong Lyα emission and a broad Mg ii doublet. The derived black hole mass of log10(MBH/M⊙) ∼ 7.3 results in MBH/M* ∼ 0.04%, consistent with the local relations, unlike the elevated ratios in other high-z reddened AGN. Finally, we use JWST data from AGN at z = 4–10 to explore an evolutionary link between high-z reddened AGN, early quiescent galaxies, and local ellipticals.

<br />总结:<br />这篇文章利用Spitzer的“隐藏”观测，构建了包含4090个光谱的目录，并研究了多环芳烃（PAH）分子及其与尘埃消光的关联。研究结果表明WISE12、E(B−V)和11.2μm的PAH带之间存在强烈的正相关关系。针对不同E(B−V)范围内，6.2μm、11.2μm和12.7μm的PAH带与E(B−V)之间的相关性也呈正相关。研究还揭示了三种尘埃温度区域。通过NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database的分解显示了6.2/11.2和PAH电离分数之间的正相关关系，而12.7/11.2稍微呈负相关，暗示了PAH结构的变化。综合光谱于五个E(B−V)和三个Tdust范围内的平均值显示了PAH发射的演变和12.7/11.2的变化。研究结果为JWST项目提供了指导。 <div>
Spitzer “hidden” observations of the background are used to construct a catalog of 4090 spectra and examine the signature of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules and their connection to extinction by dust. A strong positive correlation is recovered between WISE12, E(B − V), and the 11.2 μm PAH band. For 0.06 ≤ E(B − V) ≤ 5.0, correlations of the 6.2, 11.2, and 12.7 μm PAH band are positive with E(B − V). Three dust temperature regimes are revealed. Correlations with WISE12 are well constrained and that with 12.7/11.2 is flat. Decomposition with the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database reveals a tentative positive correlation between the 6.2/11.2 and the PAH ionization fraction, while that with 12.7/11.2 is slightly negative, suggesting PAH structural changes. The relation with PAH size and 6.2/11.2 is negative, while that with 12.7/11.2 is positive. Averaging spectra into five E(B − V) and three Tdust bins shows an evolution in PAH emission and variations in 12.7/11.2. Database-fits show an increase in fi and the PAH ionization parameter γ, but a more stable large PAH fraction. While the largest γs are associated with the highest Tdust, there is no one-to-one correlation. The analysis is hampered by low-quality data at short wavelengths. There are indications that PAHs in the more-diffuse backgrounds behave differently from those in the general interstellar medium. However, they are often still associated with larger scale filamentary cloud-like structures. The spectra and auxiliary data have been made available through the Ames Background Interstellar Medium Spectral Catalog and may guide JWST programs.

研究人员通过模拟太阳涡旋管的平衡构型，获得了MHD波的解，并得到了与MHD模式相关的Poynting flux的垂直分量Sz的表达式。他们展示了在不同背景流强度下，不同MHD模式下Sz的空间结构的二维可视化。研究发现，与无旋转流的磁通管相比，背景旋转流会增加Sz的数值。当背景流强度大于扰动的100倍时，非轴对称（∣m∣ > 0）模式的Sz会增加1000%以上。此外，研究还指出了太阳涡旋的一个基本特性，即它们不能单独在无扭曲的管道中产生向上的Poynting flux，这意味着在直通管中观察到的Sz必定源自于MHD波等扰动。 <br /><br />总结: <br />本研究通过模拟得到了太阳涡旋管的平衡构型以及MHD波的解，并研究了与MHD模式相关的Poynting flux。研究发现在背景旋转流的存在下，Poynting flux的数值会增加。此外，研究还发现太阳涡旋不能单独产生向上的Poynting flux，这些结果对理解太阳大气中磁场的输运过程具有重要意义。 <div>
Magnetic flux tubes in the presence of background rotational flows, known as solar vortex tubes, are abundant throughout the solar atmosphere and may act as conduits for MHD waves to transport magnetic energy to the upper solar atmosphere. We aim to investigate the Poynting flux associated with these waves within solar vortex tubes. We model a solar vortex tube as a straight magnetic flux tube with a background azimuthal velocity component. The MHD wave solutions in the equilibrium configuration of a vortex tube are obtained using the Shooting Eigensolver for SolAr Magnetohydrostatic Equilibria code and we derive an expression for the vertical component of the Poynting flux, Sz, associated with MHD modes. In addition, we present 2D visualizations of the spatial structure of Sz for different MHD modes under different background flow strengths. We show that Sz increases in the presence of a background rotational flow when compared to a flux tube with no rotational flow. When the strength of the background flow is greater than 100 times the strength of the perturbation, the Sz associated with non-axisymmetric (∣m∣ > 0) modes increases by over 1000% when compared to a magnetic flux tube in the absence of a background rotational flow. Furthermore, we present a fundamental property of solar vortices, namely that they cannot solely produce an upward Poynting flux in an untwisted tube, meaning that any observed Sz in straight flux tubes must arise from perturbations, such as MHD waves.

<title>Revisiting the Vertical Distribution of H i Absorbing Clouds in the Solar Neighborhood. II. Constraints from a Large Catalog of 21 cm Absorption Observations at High Galactic Latitudes</title>

<div> 关键词: 冷中性介质、CNM、银河演化、垂直分布、H i吸收观测

总结: 
本研究利用最近开发的动力学尺度高度软件包和大量敏感的H i吸收观测对冷中性介质（CNM）的垂直分布提供了新的约束。在太阳邻域，我们估计了CNM的厚度为σz∼50-90 pc，如果只考虑H i光学深度τ>0.1或柱密度N（H i）>1019.5 cm−2的结构，则厚度为σz∼50 pc。与最近的模拟结果一致，这显示了CNM在太阳邻域的厚度与内部银河中发现的相似。约20％的CNM结构被识别为异常值，这些异常值可能与当地泡士壁有关。我们的结果与最近的观测和模拟进行了比较，并讨论了它们对银河系星际介质的多相结构的影响。<br /><br /> <div>
The cold neutral medium (CNM) is where neutral atomic hydrogen (H i) is converted into molecular clouds, so the structure and kinematics of the CNM are key drivers of galaxy evolution. Here we provide new constraints on the vertical distribution of the CNM using the recently developed kinematic_scaleheight software package and a large catalog of sensitive H i absorption observations. We estimate the thickness of the CNM in the solar neighborhood to be σz ∼ 50–90 pc, assuming a Gaussian vertical distribution. This is a factor of ∼2 smaller than typically assumed, indicating that the thickness of the CNM in the solar neighborhood is similar to that found in the inner Galaxy, consistent with recent simulation results. If we consider only structures with H i optical depths τ > 0.1 or column densities N(H i) > 1019.5 cm−2, which recent work suggests are thresholds for molecule formation, we find σz ∼ 50 pc. Meanwhile, for structures with τ < 0.1 or column densities N(H i) < 1019.5 cm−2, we find σz ∼ 120 pc. These thicknesses are similar to those derived for the thin- and thick-disk molecular cloud populations traced by CO emission, possibly suggesting that cold H i and CO are well mixed. Approximately 20% of CNM structures are identified as outliers, with kinematics that are not well explained by Galactic rotation. We show that some of these CNM structures—perhaps representing intermediate-velocity clouds—are associated with the Local Bubble wall. We compare our results to recent observations and simulations, and we discuss their implications for the multiphase structure of the Milky Way’s interstellar medium.

磁层物质喷射包括狭窄的喷射形式和较宽的扇形形态；喷射由断层互换重联和磁力线稳定性引发；喷射在形成喷喷扩散顶部电流层和横跨流发磁力线后，产生了磁线重联和阿尔文波。伪流带CME与头盔流带CME具有相似的磁学演化，但喷射形态不同。总结：<br />
伪流带CME是与头盔流带CME有所不同的一类喷发。 <div>
Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from pseudostreamers represent a significant fraction of large-scale eruptions from the Sun. In some cases, these CMEs take a narrow jet-like form reminiscent of coronal jets; in others, they have a much broader fan-shaped morphology like CMEs from helmet streamers. We present results from a magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a broad pseudostreamer CME. The early evolution of the eruption is initiated through a combination of breakout interchange reconnection at the overlying null point and ideal instability of the flux rope that forms within the pseudostreamer. This stage is characterized by a rolling motion and deflection of the flux rope toward the breakout current layer. The stretching out of the strapping field forms a flare current sheet below the flux rope; reconnection onset there forms low-lying flare arcade loops and the two-ribbon flare footprint. Once the CME flux rope breaches the rising breakout current layer, interchange reconnection with the external open field disconnects one leg from the Sun. This induces a whip-like rotation of the flux rope, generating the unstructured fan shape characteristic of pseudostreamer CMEs. Interchange reconnection behind the CME releases torsional Alfvén waves and bursty dense outflows into the solar wind. Our results demonstrate that pseudostreamer CMEs follow the same overall magnetic evolution as coronal jets, although they present different morphologies of their ejecta. We conclude that pseudostreamer CMEs should be considered a class of eruptions that are distinct from helmet-streamer CMEs, in agreement with previous observational studies.

The foreshock region filled with turbulences is a natural lab for studying interactions between plasma and waves. The underlying processes are vital for dissipating the energy carried by the solar wind into the Martian environment. In this study, we analyze an ultralow-frequency wave observed on 2015 August 14 by Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution upstream of the Martian bow shock. The wave properties match with those of 30 s waves; the dispersion calculation shows that the upstream plasma was capable of generating the observed waves. The analysis of the ion behaviors implies the wave generated without a field-aligned beam, while the growth rate of waves seems to be modulated by the interplanetary magnetic field conditions. These results indicate the unique role of the Martian foreshock in the interaction between the solar wind and the planet.

<br />总结: 这项研究报告了首次在银河中心分子云G+0.693-0.027中检测到含金属的分子硫化钠和硫化镁，并初步检测到氧化钙。研究得出了它们相对于H2的丰度，并提供了其他钠、镁和钙含量的上限。研究讨论了在星际条件下形成这些含金属分子的可能化学途径。最后，通过比较带金属硫分子和氧分子的比例，研究发现金属硫分子比金属氧分子丰度更高，这进一步加强了硫可能受到抽出的观点。 <div>
We report the first detection of the metal-bearing molecules sodium sulfide and magnesium sulfide and the tentative detection of calcium monoxide in the interstellar medium toward the Galactic center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027. The derived column densities are (5.0 ± 1.1) × 1010 cm−2, (6.0 ± 0.6) × 1010 cm−2, and (2.0 ± 0.5) × 1010 cm−2, respectively. This translates into fractional abundances with respect to H2 of (3.7 ± 1.0) × 10−13, (4.4 ± 0.8) × 10−13, and (1.5 ± 0.4) × 10−13, respectively. We have also searched for other Na-, Mg-, and Ca-bearing species toward this source but none of them have been detected and thus we provide upper limits for their abundances. We discuss the possible chemical routes involved in the formation of these molecules containing metals under interstellar conditions. Finally, we compare the ratio between sulfur-bearing and oxygen-bearing molecules with and without metals, finding that metal-bearing sulfur molecules are much more abundant than metal-bearing oxygen ones, in contrast with the general trend found in the ratios between other nonmetal-oxygen- and sulfur-bearing molecules. This further strengthens the idea that sulfur may be a little depleted in G+0.693-0.027 as a result of the low-velocity shocks present in this source sputtering large amounts of material from dust grains.

With numerical simulations that employ adaptive ray-tracing (ART) for radiative transfer at the same time as evolving gas magnetohydrodynamics, thermodynamics, and photochemistry, it is possible to obtain a high-resolution view of ultraviolet (UV) fields and their effects in realistic models of the multiphase interstellar medium. Here, we analyze results from TIGRESS-NCR simulations, which follow both far-UV (FUV) wavelengths, important for photoelectric heating and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon excitation, and the Lyman continuum (LyC), which photoionizes hydrogen. Considering two models, representing solar neighborhood and inner-galaxy conditions, we characterize the spatial distribution and time variation of UV radiation fields, and quantify their correlations with gas. We compare four approximate models for the FUV to simulated values to evaluate alternatives when full ART is infeasible. By convolving FUV radiation with density, we produce mock maps of dust emission. We introduce a method to calibrate mid-IR observations, for example from JWST, to obtain high-resolution gas surface density maps. We then consider the LyC radiation field, finding most of the gas exposed to this radiation to be in ionization–recombination equilibrium and to have a low neutral fraction. Additionally, we characterize the ionization parameter as a function of the environment. Using a simplified model of the LyC radiation field, we produce synthetic maps of emission measure (EM). We show that the simplified model can be used to extract an estimate of the neutral fraction of the photoionized gas and mean free path of ionizing radiation from observed EM maps in galaxies.

HETDEX计划结合大规模的公众科学活动和机器学习，以加强HETDEX天体望远镜暗能量实验。通过Dark Energy Explorers进行了600万次分类，我们可以确信，当至少有10位个体对源进行分类时，我们能够以超过94%的置信水平确定一个源是否是虚假的；对于信噪比更高的源，这一置信水平会进一步提高。截至目前，我们只能对19万个源应用这种直接分析方法。HETDEX的全样本将包括大约2-3百万个源，包括邻近星系（[O ii]发射体）、远距星系（Lyα发射体或LAEs）、假阳性和仪器问题的污染。通过使用Dark Energy Explorers的经过目视审查的样本，我们可以应对这个10倍增加的样本量。我们已将目视审查过的样本数量从之前的试点研究中的1.4万个LAE候选者增加到19万个。此外，利用目前的目视审查样本，我们为1.2百万个LAEs候选者生成了真假阳性分类。目前，我们拥有来自全球159个国家的约1.7万名志愿者。因此，我们正在将公众科学家或公民科学家的分析应用于我们的完整HETDEX数据集，为大家创造了一个无需先前技术知识的免费教育机会。 <div>
We are merging a large participatory science effort with machine learning to enhance the Hobby–Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX). Our overall goal is to remove false positives, allowing us to use lower signal-to-noise data and sources with low goodness-of-fit. With six million classifications through Dark Energy Explorers, we can confidently determine if a source is not real at over 94% confidence level when classified by at least 10 individuals; this confidence level increases for higher signal-to-noise sources. To date, we have only been able to apply this direct analysis to 190,000 sources. The full sample of HETDEX will contain around 2–3 million sources, including nearby galaxies ([O ii] emitters), distant galaxies (Lyα emitters or LAEs), false positives, and contamination from instrument issues. We can accommodate this tenfold increase by using machine learning with visually vetted samples from Dark Energy Explorers. We have already increased by over tenfold the number of sources that have been visually vetted from our previous pilot study where we only had 14,000 visually vetted LAE candidates. This paper expands on the previous work by increasing the visually vetted sample from 14,000 to 190,000. In addition, using our currently visually vetted sample, we generate a real or false positive classification for the full candidate sample of 1.2 million LAEs. We currently have approximately 17,000 volunteers from 159 countries around the world. Thus, we are applying participatory or citizen scientist analysis to our full HETDEX data set, creating a free educational opportunity that requires no prior technical knowledge.

总结: 本文分析了KIC 8840638的光变化，利用Kepler任务的高精度时间序列数据。分析发现，该目标是一个新的分离式食双星系统，具有一个δ Scuti成分，而不是先前所知的单一δ Scuti恒星。短时序数据的频率分析显示出95个显著频率，其中大多数位于23-32天^ -1的频率范围内。其中，有七个独立频率在δ Scuti恒星的典型频率范围内，并且它们被确定为压力模式。此外，傅里叶变换和自相关函数分析还检测到可能的大分裂值 Δν = 36.5 ± 0.1 μHz。轨道频率forb（= 0.320008 day^ -1）及其谐波也在频率谱中直接检测到。从PHOEBE派生的双星模型表明，该双星系统处于分离的配置中，质量比为，倾角为°。得出的参数和双星演化模型表明，主星是一个接近离开主序的物体，温度约为7600 K，而次星似乎是一个温度比主星低约3100 K的进入巨星分支的冷组件。此外，该系统可能经历了质量比反转，其中质量更大的星是吸积成分，质量较小的星是捐赠星。<br /><br /> <div>
In this paper, we analyze the light variation of KIC 8840638 using high-precision time-series data from the Kepler mission. The analysis reveals that this target is a new detached eclipsing binary system with a δ Scuti component, rather than a single δ Scuti star as previously known. The frequency analysis of short-cadence data reveals 95 significant frequencies, most of which lie in a frequency range of 23−32 day−1. Among them, seven independent frequencies are detected in the typical frequency range of δ Scuti stars, and they are identified as pressure modes. In addition, a possible large separation value of Δν = 36.5 ± 0.1 μHz is also detected with the Fourier transform (FT) and autocorrelation function (AC) analysis. The orbital frequency forb (= 0.320008 day−1) and its harmonics are also detected directly in the frequency spectrum. The binary modelings derived from PHOEBE indicate that this binary system is in detached configurations with a mass ratio of , an inclination angle of °. The derived parameters and binary evolutionary model suggest that the primary star is an object on the verge of leaving the main sequence with a temperature of ∼7600 K, while the secondary appears to be a cool component entering the giant branch with a temperature ∼3100 K lower than the primary. Moreover, this system may have undergone a mass ratio reversal, where the more massive star is the gainer component and the less massive one is the donor star.

总结: <br /><br />本文研究了FU Ori和EX Lup类型的天体对象，在这些天体对象中观察到的化学反应提供了理解恒星和行星形成过程中关键阶段的自然实验。研究表明，这些天体物体的化学特征在恒星暴发后发生了明显的变化，而V1057 Cyg是其中一种典型的化学反应丰富的对象。其他四个天体对象的化学特征受到灵敏度限制，而V1057 Cyg包含了最高的盘/包层气体质量。这为我们深入了解这些恒星暴发对化学成分产生的影响提供了重要线索。 <div>
FU Ori– and EX Lup–type objects present natural experiments for understanding a critical stage in the star and planet formation process. These objects offer insight into the diversity of molecules available to forming planetary systems due to a sudden increase in accretion, and central luminosity causes the disk and surrounding material to increase in temperature. This allows for volatiles to sublimate off of grains and exist in the gas phase for tens to hundreds of years after initial outburst. While this dynamic stage may be common for solar-type protostars, observations of the chemical impact of these bursts are rare. In this article, we present observations from the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array of five young stellar objects (YSOs) that have undergone outbursts within the past 100 yr and catalog the volatile chemistry found within ∼1000 au of the YSO. Only one source clearly shows a line-rich spectra with >11 molecules detected, including complex organics and water, as is expected for a spectra signature for a postoutburst source. This source is V1057 Cyg, and we present it as the northern analog to the well-studied and molecule-rich FU Ori source, V883 Ori. Our conclusions on the chemical inventory of the other four sources in our sample are sensitivity limited, as V1057 Cyg contains the highest disk/envelope gas mass.

磁通绳模型正在发展，以更好地理解日冕物质抛射。传统模型对于这些大尺度结构的整体几何结构可能不够。一种新的扭曲磁通绳模型被开发出来，能够描述磁通绳断面的任意扭曲或磁轴的变形。该模型能够准确重建观测到的 ICME 事件，证明其在事件重建中的实用性。研究展示了磁通绳模型在单独和多点观测下的准确重建能力，并且表明其几何结构与圆柱体或环形近似不符。<br /><br />总结: 研究开发了新的磁通绳模型，能够描述复杂的几何结构，用于重建观测到的日冕物质抛射事件。 <div>
Magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) at the center of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) are often characterized as simplistic cylindrical or toroidal tubes with field lines that twist around the cylinder or torus axis. Recent multipoint observations suggest that the overall geometry of these large-scale structures may be significantly more complex. As such, contemporary modeling approaches are likely insufficient to properly understand the global structure of any ICME. In an attempt to rectify this issue, we have developed a novel flux rope modeling approach that allows for the description of arbitrary distortions of the flux rope cross section or deformation of the magnetic axis. The resulting distorted MFR model is a fully analytic model that can be used to describe a complex geometry and is numerically efficient enough to be used for event reconstructions. To demonstrate the usefulness of our approach, we focus on a specific implementation of our model and apply it to an ICME event that was observed in situ on 2023 April 23 at the L1 point by the Wind spacecraft and also by the STEREO-A spacecraft, which was 10.°2 further east and 0.°9 south in heliographic coordinates. We demonstrate that our model can accurately reconstruct each observation individually and also gives a fair reconstruction of both events simultaneously using a multipoint reconstruction algorithm, which results in a geometry that is inconsistent with a cylindrical or toroidal approximation.

总结:<br />
本文介绍了一种新的辐射传输建模框架，用于解释HH 48 NE冰盘中观察到的H2O，CO2和CO冰带的组成和混合状态。结果显示冰主要以混合形式存在，其中CO被分别困在H2O和CO2冰中。HH 48 NE冰盘的组成与早期原恒星阶段有明显差异，暗示了盘的形成或演化过程中的热化学再加工。我们推断整个盘中的冰相C/O比率很低，约为0.1，并且还展示了冰的混合和捕获对C/O比率的径向依赖性产生了显著影响。因此，在比较行星组成和可能的形成情景时，考虑到现实的冰盘组成是至关重要的，而幸运的是，这将有可能用JWST对越来越多的冰盘进行观测。 <div>
Planet formation is strongly influenced by the composition and distribution of volatiles within protoplanetary disks. With JWST, it is now possible to obtain direct observational constraints on disk ices, as recently demonstrated by the detection of ice absorption features toward the edge-on HH 48 NE disk as part of the Ice Age Early Release Science program. Here, we introduce a new radiative transfer modeling framework designed to retrieve the composition and mixing status of disk ices using their band profiles, and apply it to interpret the H2O, CO2, and CO ice bands observed toward the HH 48 NE disk. We show that the ices are largely present as mixtures, with strong evidence for CO trapping in both H2O and CO2 ice. The HH 48 NE disk ice composition (pure versus polar versus apolar fractions) is markedly different from earlier protostellar stages, implying thermal and/or chemical reprocessing during the formation or evolution of the disk. We infer low ice-phase C/O ratios around 0.1 throughout the disk, and also demonstrate that the mixing and entrapment of disk ices can dramatically affect the radial dependence of the C/O ratio. It is therefore imperative that realistic disk ice compositions are considered when comparing planetary compositions with potential formation scenarios, which will fortunately be possible for an increasing number of disks with JWST.

<div> 关键词: AstroSat, X射线双星, 2017年爆发, 类C准周期振荡, 宽带谱分析
总结: 本文利用AstroSat观测了低质量黑洞X射线双星H 1743–322在2017年爆发期间的全面定时和宽带谱分析。我们在同时进行的AstroSat和Swift/XRT观测中检测到约0.4赫兹的C型准周期振荡（QPO），而AstroSat数据中仅在约0.9赫兹处观察到上调谐波。在2017和2018年两次失败的爆发中探测到软时滞，表明软时滞可能与反射特征相关。宽带谱分析表明，源在AstroSat观测期间处于低/硬态。模拟得出，当源的光度约为Eddington光度的1.6%时，存在一个受内部稳定圆轨道截断的明显截断的粘附盘。 <br /><br /> Overall, 本文使用AstroSat对H 1743–322进行了全面定时和宽带谱分析，探测到2017年爆发的失败特征，检测到C型QPO，并观察到软时滞。同时，根据宽带谱分析结果，对源的状态进行了有效的建模。 <div>
We perform a comprehensive timing and broadband spectral analysis using an AstroSat observation of the low-mass black hole X-ray binary H 1743–322 during its 2017 outburst. Additionally, we use two Swift/XRT observations, one of which is simultaneous with AstroSat and the other taken three days earlier, for timing analysis. The hardness–intensity diagram indicates that the 2017 outburst was a failed one, unlike the previous successful outburst in 2016. We detect type C quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the simultaneous AstroSat and Swift/XRT observations at ∼0.4 Hz, whereas an upper harmonic is noticed at ∼0.9 Hz in the AstroSat data only. Although these features are found to be energy-independent, we notice a shift of ∼0.08 Hz in the QPO frequency over the interval of three days. We also investigate the nature of variability in the two consecutive failed outbursts in 2017 and 2018. We detect soft time lags of 23.2 ± 12.2 ms and 140 ± 80 ms at the type C QPO frequencies in 2017 AstroSat and 2018 XMM-Newton data, respectively. The lag–energy spectra from both the outbursts suggest that the soft lags may be associated with reflection features. The broadband spectral analysis indicates that the source was in the low/hard state during the AstroSat observation. Modeling of the disk and reflection continuum suggests the presence of an accretion disk that is significantly truncated by at least 27.4rg from the innermost stable circular orbit when the source luminosity is ∼1.6% of the Eddington luminosity.

<div> 高红移类星体，周期振荡， Fermi Large Area Telescope， QPOs， 二元黑洞<br />
总结:<br />
本研究针对高红移FSRQs的两个类星体进行了研究，发现它们的光变曲线呈现出周期性的高低态变化，表现出QPOs的可能性。通过数据积分和适用于稀疏采样数据的方法对曲线进行分析，估算出两个类星体分别可能存在4.69年和6.82年的QPOs。此外，还分析了类星体的流量概率密度函数以及流量和光谱指数的相关性，考虑了二元黑洞情景作为周期性的可能解释，并估算了潜在的系统参数，结果与中心黑洞质量的独立测量一致。 <div>
While there has been an increase in interest in the possibility of quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) in blazars, the search has hitherto been restricted to sources with well-sampled light curves. Objects with light curves that include gaps have been, to our knowledge, overlooked. Here, we study two such curves, which have the interesting feature of pertaining to relatively high-redshift blazars—FSRQs, PKS 2155-83, and PKS 2255-282—observed by the Fermi Large Area Telescope. Their redshifts border the “cosmic noon” era of galaxy formation and merging, and their light curves exhibit a distinctive pattern of repetitive high and low (gap dominant) states for 15.6 yr. To accommodate for the gaps in the curves, data are integrated over extended time intervals of 1 month and 2 months. The resulting curves were also examined using methods suitable for sparsely sampled data. This investigation of PKS 2155-83 and PKS 2255-282 suggests QPOs with periods of 4.69 ± 0.79 yr (3σ) and 6.82 ± 2.25 yr (2.8σ), respectively. The probability density functions of the blazars’ fluxes, along with the correlation between their flux and spectral index, were also analyzed. Given the epochs in which the objects are observed, the plausibility of a binary black hole scenario as an origin of the apparent periodicity was examined. We estimated the prospective parameters of such a system using a simple geometric model. The total masses were estimated and found to be consistent, in principle, with independent (dynamical) measurements of the central black hole masses in the two host galaxies.

<div> 关键词: 黑洞-伴星双星系统，光度变化，Gaia，TESS，天体测量学<br />
<br />
总结: 本研究使用双星人口综合模型创建了银河系中现实的黑洞-光亮伴星双星系统的人口统计。研究发现，通过测量光度变化，Gaia和TESS任务预计能够分辨约300-1000个（SNR ≥ 10）黑洞-伴星双星系统，而TESS任务预计能够分辨约50-200个。此外，Gaia的径向速度测量也能够帮助解析大约60-70个（SNR ≥ 10）的黑洞-伴星双星系统。这些结果对于揭示黑洞及其前体之间的联系具有重要意义。 <div>
Understanding the connection between the properties of black holes (BHs) and their progenitors is interesting in many branches of astrophysics. Discovering BHs in detached orbits with luminous companions (LCs) promises to help establish this connection since the LC and BH progenitor are expected to have the same metallicity and formation time. We explore the possibility of detecting BH–LC binaries in detached orbits using photometric variations of the LC flux, induced by tidal ellipsoidal variation, relativistic beaming, and self-lensing. We create realistic present-day populations of detached BH–LC binaries in the Milky Way (MW) using binary population synthesis where we adopt observationally motivated initial stellar and binary properties, star formation history, and the present-day distribution of these sources in the MW based on detailed cosmological simulations. We test detectability of these sources via photometric variability by Gaia and TESS missions by incorporating their respective detailed detection biases as well as interstellar extinction. We find that Gaia is expected to resolve ∼300–1000 (∼700–1500) detached BH–LC binaries with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ≥ 10 (1) depending on the photometric precision and details of supernova physics. Similarly, the number of resolved BH–LC binaries with TESS is ∼50–200 (∼140–350). We find that BH–LC binaries would be common between Gaia and TESS. Moreover, ∼60–70 (∼50–200) BH–LC binaries identifiable using photometry with SNR ≥ 10 may also be resolved using Gaia’s radial velocity (astrometry).

<title>JWST/NIRSpec Observations of Brown Dwarfs in the Orion Nebula Cluster</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have used the multiobject mode of the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to obtain low-resolution 1–5 μm spectra of 22 brown dwarf candidates in the Orion Nebula Cluster, which were selected with archival images from the Hubble Space Telescope. One of the targets was previously classified as a Herbig–Haro (HH) object and exhibits strong emission in H i, H2, and the fundamental band of CO, further demonstrating that HH objects can have bright emission in that CO band. The remaining targets have late spectral types (M6.5 to early L) and are young based on gravity-sensitive features, as expected for low-mass members of the cluster. According to theoretical evolutionary models, these objects should have masses that range from the hydrogen burning limit to 0.003–0.007 M⊙. Two of the NIRSpec targets were identified as proplyds in earlier analysis of Hubble images. They have spectral types of M6.5 and M7.5, making them two of the coolest and least massive known proplyds. Another brown dwarf shows absorption bands at 3–5 μm from ices containing H2O, CO2, OCN−, and CO, indicating that it is either an edge-on class II system or a class I protostar. It is the coolest and least massive object that has detections of these ice features. In addition, it appears to be the first candidate for a protostellar brown dwarf that has spectroscopy confirming its late spectral type.

<title>Photonuclear Reaction Rates of 157,159Ho and 163,165Tm and Their Impact in the γ-process</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Reliable photonuclear reaction rates in stellar conditions are essential for understanding the origin of the heavy stable neutron-deficient isotopes between 74Se and 196Hg, i.e., p-nuclei. However, many reaction rates of relevance still have to rely on the Hauser–Feshbach (HF) model due to the rarity of experimental progress. One such case is in the mass range of 160 for Dy, Er, Ho, and Tm isotopes. In this work we attempt to constrain the HF model in the TALYS package by reproducing the available experimental data on 160Dy(p, γ)161Ho and 162Er(p, γ)163Tm in the A ∼ 160 mass region, and examine the effects of level density, gamma strength function, and the optical model potential. The constrained model then allows us to calculate the reaction rates of 157,159Ho(γ, p) and 163,165Tm(γ, p) for the γ-process nucleosynthesis in a carbon-deflagration model for Type Ia supernovae. Our recommended rates differ from the JINA REACLIB by more than one order of magnitude in the temperature range 2–3 GK. This results in changes in the final abundance of p-nuclei in the A ∼ 160 mass range by −5.5% to 3% from those with JINA, which means that the uncertainty of (γ, p) reactions is not predominant for the synthesis of these nuclei.

<title>How Long Will the Quasar UV/Optical Flickering Be Damped? II. The Observational Test</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The characteristic timescale at which the variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) turns from red noise to white noise can probe the accretion physics around supermassive black holes (SMBHs). A number of works have studied the characteristic timescale of quasars and obtained quite different scaling relations between the timescale and quasar physical properties. One possible reason for the discrepancies is that the characteristic timescale can be easily underestimated if the light curves are not long enough. In this work, we construct well-defined AGN samples to observationally test the relationships between the characteristic timescale and AGN properties obtained by previous works. Our samples eliminate the effects of insufficient light-curve lengths. We confirm that the timescale predictions of the Corona Heated Accretion disk Reprocessing model are consistent with our timescale measurements. The timescale predictions by empirical relations are systematically smaller than our measured ones. Our results provide further evidence that AGN variability is driven by thermal fluctuations in SMBH accretion disks. Future flagship time-domain surveys can critically test our conclusions and reveal the physical nature of AGN variability.

<title>Exploring the Dynamic Rotational Profile of the Hotter Solar Atmosphere: A Multiwavelength Approach Using SDO/AIA Data</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Understanding the global rotational profile of the solar atmosphere and its variation is fundamental to uncovering a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of the solar magnetic field and the extent of coupling between different layers of the Sun. In this study, we employ the method of image correlation to analyze the extensive data set provided by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly of the Solar Dynamic Observatory in different wavelength channels. We find a significant increase in the equatorial rotational rate (A) and a decrease in absolute latitudinal gradient (∣B∣) at all temperatures representative of the solar atmosphere, implying an equatorial rotation up to 4.18% and 1.92% faster and less differential when compared to the rotation rates for the underlying photosphere derived from Doppler measurement and sunspots respectively. In addition, we also find a significant increase in equatorial rotation rate (A) and a decrease in differential nature (∣B∣ decreases) at different layers of the solar atmosphere. We also explore a possible connection from the solar interior to the atmosphere and interestingly found that A at r = 0.94 R⊙ and 0.965 R⊙ show an excellent match with 171 Å, 304 Å, and 1600 Å, respectively. Furthermore, we observe a positive correlation between the rotational parameters measured from 1600 Å, 131 Å, 193 Å, and 211 Å with the yearly averaged sunspot number, suggesting a potential dependence of the solar rotation on the appearance of magnetic structures related to the solar cycle or the presence of cycle dependence of solar rotation in the solar atmosphere.

<title>Multifluid Theory of Electrostatic Ion Cyclotron Waves in Partially Ionized Plasmas</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Partially ionized plasmas universally exist in various astrophysical environments, such as the solar atmosphere and the E region of the ionosphere. In these contexts, the existence and propagation of waves in plasmas could be significantly influenced by effects of weakly ionized plasma (e.g., ion–neutral collisions). In this work, we investigate electrostatic ion cyclotron (EIC) waves in partially ionized plasmas based on the multifluid model with adiabatic electrons. Two distinct branches of EIC waves coexist in partially ionized plasmas: one branch is the conventional EIC waves; the other branch propagates around the “effective ion cyclotron frequency” which originates from self-consistent ion–neutral collisions. Furthermore, theoretical predictions in the new branch of EIC waves are qualitatively consistent with laboratory observations. In addition, a comparison between our theory and the previous work is also performed. This work can aid in understanding the acceleration and transverse heating of ions in partially ionized astrophysical plasmas where the ion–neutral collisions are frequent.

<title>Characteristics and Source Regions of Slow Alfvénic Solar Wind Observed by Parker Solar Probe</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using a classification scheme for solar-wind type based on the heliocentric distance of the observation, we look at near-perihelion observations from Parker Solar Probe Encounters 4 to 14 to study the sources of the slow Alfvénic solar wind (SASW). Through Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) modeling and ballistic mapping, we connect streams to their solar source and find that a primary population of SASW comes from low magnetic field strength regions (low-B0), likely small coronal holes (CHs) and their overexpanded boundaries, while a second population of high field strength (high-B0) seems to emerge from non-CH structures potentially through interchange reconnection with nearby open field lines. This low-B0 SASW shows larger expansion than the fast solar wind (FSW) but similar mass flux, potentially indicating additional heating below the critical point, and emergence from a cooler structure, which could lead to slower wind emerging from CH-like structures. We show that this low-B0 SASW shows stronger preferential acceleration of alpha particles (similar to the FSW) than the high-B0 SASW, and that this is a velocity-dependent phenomenon as found in previous studies. To have additional confidence in our mapping results, we quantify the error on both the PFSS model and ballistic mapping and discuss how additional multipoint observations of plasma parameters and composition would allow us to better constrain our models and connect the solar wind to its source.

<title>Joint Observation of a Series of Magnetic Holes by Tianwen-1 and MAVEN on Mars</title>

Magnetic holes (MHs) are transient magnetic structures responsible for energy conversion in space plasma. Using single-spacecraft measurements from Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN), the existence of MHs on Mars has been confirmed. However, due to the limitations of single-spacecraft observations, significant uncertainty also arises on the identification of the spatial scale and 3D geometry of MHs. In this study, we report a series of MHs successively detected by Tianwen-1 near the high-latitude magnetopause and by the MAVEN spacecraft near the subsolar magnetopause. The large separation between Tianwen-1 and MAVEN (∼4 RM) suggests these MHs are macroscale structures extending along the axial direction. Additionally, we observe whistler waves generated by electron perpendicular anisotropy in one of the macroscale MHs. This study is the first joint observation of Martian MHs, shedding light on the research of transient magnetic structures on Mars.

ZrO is a well-studied metal monoxide because of its astrophysical importance in characterizing S stars. The bands of the d3Φ–a3Δ system (γ system) with and v″ ≤ 5 are rotationally analyzed using the PGOPHER program to provide spectroscopic constants. The high-resolution ZrO emission spectrum was recorded with a Fourier transform spectrometer using a high-temperature carbon furnace source. New ab initio calculations of the transition dipole moment were carried out in order to determine the vibronic band strengths. The spectroscopic constants, along with the band strengths, are used to calculate a line list for the γ system. This line list can be used to determine Zr abundances in S stars. We also correct the line strengths for the B1Π–A1Δ transition calculated in our previous work.

<title>Heavy Ion Escape at Mars during the Disappearing Solar Wind Event in 2022 December</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A unique event known as the disappearing solar wind (DSW), characterized by an extremely low-density solar wind stream, occurred at Mars on 2022 December 26–27. As this stream flowed past Mars, several properties of the Mars–solar wind interaction changed in response to the density drop. We utilize in situ plasma measurements from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN spacecraft to examine heavy ion escape during this event. We find that escaping ions with energies above and below 30 eV responded differently to the reduction in solar wind density. High-energy ions experienced a decrease in flux, whereas low-energy ions experienced an increase, regardless of whether they were escaping through the plume or tailward channel. Furthermore, we observe a net reduction in the flux of plume escaping ions during the DSW period, primarily due to a considerable reduction in the high-energy component, which typically dominates plume escape. In contrast, the overall flux of tailward escaping ions increased during this period. These variations in heavy ion escape are mainly attributed to substantial reductions in solar wind dynamic pressure and momentum density. This paper provides new insights into the dynamics of heavy ion escape under an exceptional state of the Mars–solar wind interaction.

总结: 本研究利用Keck Planet Finder的极其精密的多普勒速度观测和NASA的Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite的高频光度测量，在邻近的K矮星σ Draconis上检测到了太阳类振荡现象。这颗恒星是迄今为止观测到的最冷的矮星，具有太阳类振荡的光度和速度观测值。观测结果与已建立的振荡光度-速度幅度关系非常吻合，并进一步证明了Teff < 5500 K的恒星的模式振幅遵循(L/M)1.5关系。通过对光度数据建模，测量出该恒星的天体测量年龄为4.5亿年。这些观测结果表明，下一代光谱仪和精密的空间光度测量技术能够将观测星际地壳运动学扩展到邻近的冷矮星，这对于恒星天体物理学具有重要意义，并且对未来的空间望远镜直接成像行星是极其重要的目标。 <br /><br /> <div>
Asteroseismology of dwarf stars cooler than the Sun is very challenging owing to the low amplitudes and rapid timescales of oscillations. Here we present the asteroseismic detection of solar-like oscillations at 4-minute timescales ( μHz) in the nearby K dwarf σ Draconis using extreme-precision Doppler velocity observations from the Keck Planet Finder and 20 s cadence photometry from NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. The star is the coolest dwarf star to date with both velocity and luminosity observations of solar-like oscillations, having amplitudes of 5.9 ± 0.8 cm s−1 and 0.8 ± 0.2 ppm, respectively. These measured values are in excellent agreement with established luminosity−velocity amplitude relations for oscillations and provide further evidence that mode amplitudes for stars with Teff < 5500 K diminish in scale following an (L/M)1.5 relation. By modeling the star’s oscillation frequencies from photometric data, we measure an asteroseismic age of 4.5 ± 0.9 (ran) ± 1.2 (sys) Gyr. The observations demonstrate the capability of next-generation spectrographs and precise space-based photometry to extend observational asteroseismology to nearby cool dwarfs, which are benchmarks for stellar astrophysics and prime targets for directly imaging planets using future space-based telescopes.

<div> 关键词: 辐射, 圆形双星系统, 圆环盘, 温度分布, 能谱

总结:<br /><br />这篇论文研究了围绕恒星到中等质量黑洞的环绕盘(CBD)受到两个黑洞周围的两个小盘辐射（即辐射），对其光谱的影响。研究假设CBD是一个标准的盘，并采用轨道平均辐射通量来计算CBD的温度分布和相应的盘能谱。研究发现，CBD的光谱几乎不受双星质量比的影响。此外，研究还发现两个小盘和CBD的联合光谱具有双峰特性，一个在软X射线波段，另一个在红外波段。观测到的流量密度向软X射线峰增加，而远离红外峰的频率减小。后者的特征可以通过用Subaru和JWST进行近红外观测进行验证。 <div>
We study the effect of irradiation from two accretion disks (minidisks) around respective black holes of stellar-to-intermediate masses in a circular binary on the spectrum of a circumbinary disk (CBD) surrounding them. We assume the CBD to be a standard disk and adopt the orbit-averaged irradiation flux because the viscous timescale is much longer than the orbital period. We then solve the energy equation both analytically and numerically to compute the CBD temperature distribution and the corresponding disk spectrum. We find that the analytically calculated spectra are in good agreement with the numerical ones. The CBD spectrum is almost independent of the binary mass ratio. We also find that the combined spectra of two minidisks and the CBD have double peaks, one peak in the soft X-ray band and the other in the infrared (IR) band. The former peak comes from the two minidisks, while the latter peak from the CBD. The observed flux density increases with frequency as ν1/3 toward the soft X-ray peak, while it decreases with frequency away from the IR peak as ν−5/3. The latter feature is testable with near-IR observations with Subaru and JWST.

<div> AGNs, black hole accretion, SED evolution, disk-corona connection, X-ray variability
<br /><br />总结: 通过对1ES 1927+654的研究发现，其光谱能量分布的演化经历了四个不同阶段，表现出超过Eddington极限的黑洞吸积率。此外，还观察到紫外线亮度和光学到X射线斜率（αOX）之间的相关性，以及光学玻尔克分子校正因子（κ5100）的双分支特性。此外，还发现了盘-冠连接的强有力证据，以及X射线辐射在辐射-温度图中显示出的系统性变化。研究还发现，出现在650天后，出现了从厚盘向薄盘的过渡现象。 <div>
Time-domain studies of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) offer a powerful tool for understanding black hole accretion physics. Prior to the optical outburst on 2017 December 23, 1ES 1927+654 was classified as a “true” type 2 AGN, an unobscured source intrinsically devoid of broad-line emission in polarized spectra. Through our 3 yr monitoring campaign spanning X-ray to ultraviolet/optical wavelengths, we analyze the post-outburst evolution of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of 1ES 1927+654. Examination of the intrinsic SED and subsequent modeling using different models reveal that the post-outburst spectrum is best described by a combination of a disk, blackbody, and corona components. We detect systematic SED variability and identify four distinct stages in the evolution of these components. During the event the accretion rate is typically above the Eddington limit. The correlation between ultraviolet luminosity and optical to X-ray slope (αOX) resembles that seen in previous studies of type 1 AGNs, yet exhibits two distinct branches with opposite slopes. The optical bolometric correction factor (κ5100) is ∼10 times higher than typical AGNs, again displaying two distinct branches. Correlations among the corona optical depth, disk surface density, and αOX provide compelling evidence of a disk–corona connection. The X-ray corona showcases systematic variation in the compactness-temperature plot. Between 200 and 650 days, the corona is “hotter when brighter,” whereas after 650 days, it becomes “cooler when brighter.” This bimodal behavior, in conjunction with the bifurcated branches of αOX and κ5100, offers strong evidence of a transition from a slim disk to a thin disk ∼650 days after the outburst.

本研究分析了917对Gaia天体测量双星，发现主星的自转速度在面对面轨道上明显较慢，表明存在显著的自转轨道对齐。这些双星的主星自转速度较慢，属于早期恒星双峰自转速度分布中的慢旋转群体。质量比小于0.3的双星主星自转速度更小，与模型预测一致。然而，具有大离心率（大于0.4）的双星并不显示自转轨道对齐或自转速度减小。通过蒙特卡洛技术，测量了自转轨道对齐率为75% ± 5% ，平均自转减小因子为〈Salign〉= 0.43 ± 0.04。因此，我们得出结论，75%的A型近密双星可能经历了周围双星盘吸积，并可能通过盘片碎裂和内向盘片迁移的方式形成。剩下的25%，主要是那些具有大离心率的双星，可能通过核心碎裂和动力摩擦引起的轨道衰减形成。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究分析了大量双星系统，发现了主星自转速度与轨道对齐的关系，以及这种现象对双星形成和演化的重要性。结果表明，大部分A型近密双星可能通过盘片碎裂和内向盘片迁移形成，而一小部分通过核心碎裂和动力摩擦引起的轨道衰减形成。 <div>
The spin–orbit alignment of binary stars traces their formation and accretion history. Previous studies of spin–orbit alignment have been limited to small samples, slowly rotating solar-type stars, and/or wide visual binaries that not surprisingly manifest random spin–orbit orientations. We analyze 917 Gaia astrometric binaries across periods P = 100–3000 days (a = 0.5–5 au) that have B8-F1 IV/V primaries (M1 = 1.5–3 M⊙) and measured projected rotational velocities v sin i. The primary stars in face-on orbits exhibit substantially smaller v sin i compared to those in edge-on orbits at the 6σ level, demonstrating significant spin–orbit alignment. The primaries in our astrometric binaries are rotating more slowly than their single-star or wide-binary counterparts and therefore comprise the slow-rotator population in the observed bimodal rotational velocity distribution of early-type stars. We discuss formation models of close binaries where some of the disk angular momentum is transferred to the orbit and/or secondary spin, quenching angular momentum flow to the primary spin. The primaries in astrometric binaries with small mass ratios q = M2/M1 < 0.3 possess even smaller v sin i, consistent with model predictions. Meanwhile, astrometric binaries with large eccentricities e > 0.4 do not display spin–orbit alignment or spin reduction. Using a Monte Carlo technique, we measure a spin–orbit alignment fraction of Falign = 75% ± 5% and an average spin reduction factor of 〈Salign〉 = 0.43 ± 0.04. We conclude that 75% of close A-type binaries likely experienced circumbinary disk accretion and probably formed via disk fragmentation and inward disk migration. The remaining 25%, mostly those with e > 0.4, likely formed via core fragmentation and orbital decay via dynamical friction.

We present the substellar mass function of star-forming clusters (≃0.1 Myr old) in a low-metallicity environment (≃−0.7 dex). We performed deep JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging of two star-forming clusters in Digel Cloud 2, a star-forming region in the outer Galaxy (RG ≳ 15 kpc). The very high sensitivity and spatial resolution of JWST enable us to resolve cluster members clearly down to a mass detection limit of 0.02 M⊙, enabling the first detection of brown dwarfs in low-metallicity clusters. A total of 52 and 91 sources were extracted in mass-AV-limited samples in the two clusters, from which initial mass functions (IMFs) were derived by model-fitting the F200W band luminosity function, resulting in IMF peak masses (hereafter MC) for both clusters. Although the uncertainties are rather large, the obtained MC values are lower than those in any previous study ( ). Comparison with the local open clusters with similar ages to the target clusters (∼106–107 yr) suggests a metallicity dependence of MC, with lower MC at lower metallicities, while the comparison with globular clusters, with similarly low metallicities but considerably older (∼1010 yr), suggests that the target clusters have not yet experienced significant dynamical evolution and remain in their initial physical condition. The lower MC is also consistent with the theoretical expectation of the lower Jeans mass owing to the higher gas density under such low metallicity. The MC values derived from observations in such an environment would place significant constraints on the understanding of star formation.

总结:
本文讨论了在宇宙星系形成模拟中实施的传统星际介质子网格模型，并介绍了新的第一原理模型的优势。作者将TIGRESS数值框架的校准与PRFM理论相结合，比较了TNG50模拟的本机输出和PRFM的后处理预测。研究发现，PRFM模型预测高密度和红移时的气体耗尽时间比SH03模型短。这些结果代表了在宇宙星系形成模拟中实施新的、经过数值校准的子网格算法的第一步。<br /><br /> <div>
Traditional star formation subgrid models implemented in cosmological galaxy formation simulations, such as that of V. Springel & L. Hernquist (hereafter SH03), employ adjustable parameters to satisfy constraints measured in the local Universe. In recent years, however, theory and spatially resolved simulations of the turbulent, multiphase, star-forming interstellar medium (ISM) have begun to produce new first-principles models, which when fully developed can replace traditional subgrid prescriptions. This approach has advantages of being physically motivated and predictive rather than empirically tuned, and allowing for varying environmental conditions rather than being tied to local-Universe conditions. As a prototype of this new approach, by combining calibrations from the TIGRESS numerical framework with the pressure-regulated feedback-modulated (PRFM) theory, simple formulae can be obtained for both the gas depletion time and an effective equation of state. Considering galaxies in TNG50, we compare the “native” simulation outputs with postprocessed predictions from PRFM. At TNG50 resolution, the total midplane pressure is nearly equal to the total ISM weight, indicating that galaxies in TNG50 are close to satisfying vertical equilibrium. The measured gas scale height is also close to theoretical equilibrium predictions. The slopes of the effective equations of states are similar, but with effective velocity dispersion normalization from SH03 slightly larger than that from current TIGRESS simulations. Because of this and the decrease in PRFM feedback yield at high pressure, the PRFM model predicts shorter gas depletion times than the SH03 model at high densities and redshift. Our results represent a first step toward implementing new, numerically calibrated subgrid algorithms in cosmological galaxy formation simulations.

The CO(1–0) line has been carefully calibrated as a tracer of molecular gas mass. However, recent studies often favor higher J transitions of the CO molecule, which are brighter and accessible for redshift ranges where CO(1–0) is not. These lines are not perfect analogs for CO(1–0), owing to their more stringent excitation conditions, and must be calibrated for use as molecular gas tracers. Here, we introduce the Arizona Molecular ISM Survey with the SMT, a multi-CO line survey of z ∼ 0 galaxies conducted to calibrate the CO(2–1) and CO(3–2) lines. The final survey includes CO(2–1) spectra of 176 galaxies and CO(3–2) spectra for a subset of 45. We supplement these with archival CO(1–0) spectra from xCOLD GASS for all sources and additional CO(1–0) observations with the Kitt Peak 12 m Telescope. Targets were selected to be representative of the 109M⊙ ≤ M* ≤ 1011.5M⊙ galaxy population. Our project emphasized careful characterization of statistical and systematic uncertainties to enable studies of trends in CO line ratios. We show that optical and CO disk sizes are on average equal, for both the CO(1–0) and CO(2–1) line. We measure the distribution of CO line luminosity ratios, finding medians (16th–84th percentile) of 0.71 (0.51–0.96) for the CO(2–1)-to-CO(1–0) ratio, 0.39 (0.24–0.53) for the CO(3–2)-to-CO(1–0) ratio, and 0.53 (0.41–0.74) for the CO(3–2)-to-CO(2–1) ratio. A companion paper presents our study of CO(2–1)'s applicability as a molecular gas mass tracer and search for trends in the CO(2–1)-to-CO(1–0) ratio. Our catalog of CO line luminosities is publicly available.

The degree of spin–orbit alignment in a population of binary stars can be determined from measurements of their orbital inclinations and rotational broadening of their spectral lines. Alignment in a face-on binary guarantees low rotational broadening, while alignment in an edge-on binary maximizes the rotational broadening. In contrast, if spin–orbit angles (ψ) are random, rotational broadening should not depend on orbital inclination. Using this technique, we investigated a sample of 2727 astrometric binaries from Gaia DR3 with F-type primaries and orbital periods between 50 and 1000 days (separations 0.3–2.7 au). We found that ψ is strongly associated with e, the orbital eccentricity. When e < 0.15, the mean spin–orbit angle is degrees, while for e > 0.7, it rises to degrees. These results suggest that some binaries are affected by processes during their formation or evolution that excite both orbital eccentricity and inclination.

新的快速滚动（FR）机制在广义非标准自然膨胀中引入了原始黑洞（PBH）和引力波（GW）的产生。该模型中，通过选择合适的非标准质量尺度参数M(ϕ)的函数，可以产生场演化路径中的悬崖状区域。当通胀场沿着陡峭的悬崖滚动时，其在FR阶段的动能会比缓慢滚动阶段增加。因此，PBH产生的种子就在这个瞬态的FR阶段诞生了。根据悬崖的位置，可以形成适合解释总黑暗物质、微引力透镜效应、LIGO-Virgo事件和NANOGrav 15年数据的PBH的适当案例。该模型的其中一个案例的引力波密度谱落在NANOGrav 15年的范围内，并呈现出Ω_gw ∝ f^3.42的行为，符合NANOGrav 15年的约束。此外，根据再热考虑，证明PBH是在辐射主导时代诞生的。此外，还说明了该模型在理论滩地标准和宇宙微波背景尺度的观测约束方面的可行性。<br /><br />总结: 本论文介绍了一种新的快速滚动机制，用于在广义非标准自然膨胀中产生原始黑洞和引力波。该模型具有解释多种宇宙现象的潜力，并且在理论和观测方面都得到了验证。 <div>
In this work, a new fast-roll (FR) mechanism to generate primordial black holes (PBHs) and gravitational waves (GWs) in generalized noncanonical natural inflation is introduced. In this model, choosing a suitable function for noncanonical mass scale parameter M(ϕ) gives rise to produce a cliff-like region in the field evolution path. When inflaton rolls down the steep cliff, its kinetic energy during an FR stage increases in comparison with a slow-roll stage. Hence, seeds of PBH production are born in this transient FR stage. Depending on the position of the cliff, appropriate cases of PBHs for explaining total dark matter, microlensing effects, LIGO–Virgo events, and NANOGrav 15 yr data can be formed. The density spectrum of GWs related to one case of the model lies in the NANOGrav 15 yr domain and behaves like . The spectral index γ = 3.42 for this case satisfies the NANOGrav 15 yr constraint. Moreover, regarding reheating considerations, it is demonstrated that PBHs are born in the radiation-dominated era. Furthermore, viability of the model in light of theoretical swampland criteria and observational constraints on cosmic microwave background scales are illustrated.

<div> 关键词: sub-Neptunes, water condensation, atmospheric compositions, James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), spectroscopic observations

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了水冷凝对亚海王星大气成分的影响，特别关注了詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜（JWST）光谱观测的影响。研究表明，水冷凝可以显著影响大气成分，尤其是稀薄氢气包围层的行星。这种影响主要表现为大气中氧耗竭，造成碳/氧比例增加。这种变化特别影响氢气丰富的行星，导致主要氮和碳的载体从N2和富氧物种如CO/CO2转向更重的碳氢化合物和腈。JWST对LHS 1140 b的观测谱可能与这种情况一致，表明表面浅层存在大量水冷凝或高大气C/O比。相反，JWST对K2-18 b的观测与具有厚大气层的富挥发性迷你海王星更为一致。 <div>
Understanding the surface temperature and interior structure of cold-to-temperate sub-Neptunes is critical for assessing their habitability, yet direct observations are challenging. In this study, we investigate the impact of water condensation on the atmospheric compositions of sub-Neptunes, focusing on the implications for James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) spectroscopic observations. By modeling the atmospheric photochemistry of two canonical sub-Neptunes, K2-18 b and LHS 1140 b, both with and without water condensation and with and without thick atmospheres, we demonstrate that water condensation can significantly affect the predicted atmospheric compositions. This effect is driven by oxygen depletion from the condensation of water vapor and primarily manifests as an increase in the C/O ratio within the photochemically active regions of the atmosphere. This change in composition particularly affects planets with thin H2-dominated atmospheres, leading to a transition in dominant nitrogen and carbon carriers from N2 and oxygen-rich species like CO/CO2 toward heavier hydrocarbons and nitriles. While our models do not fully account for the loss mechanisms of these higher-order species, such molecules can go on to form more refractory molecules or hazes. Planets with thin H2-rich atmospheres undergoing significant water condensation are thus likely to exhibit very hazy atmospheres. The relatively flat JWST spectra observed for LHS 1140 b could be consistent with such a scenario, suggesting a shallow surface with extensive water condensation or a high atmospheric C/O ratio. Conversely, the JWST observations of K2-18 b are better aligned with a volatile-rich mini-Neptune with a thick atmosphere.

We present a detailed investigation of photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric observations of the Type II SN 2023ixf. Earlier studies have provided compelling evidence for a delayed shock breakout from a confined dense circumstellar matter (CSM) enveloping the progenitor star. The temporal evolution of polarization in the SN 2023ixf phase revealed three distinct peaks in polarization evolution at 1.4 days, 6.4 days, and 79.2 days, indicating an asymmetric dense CSM, an aspherical shock front and clumpiness in the low-density extended CSM, and an aspherical inner ejecta/He-core. SN 2023ixf displayed two dominant axes, one along the CSM-outer ejecta and the other along the inner ejecta/He-core, showcasing the independent origin of asymmetry in the early and late evolution. The argument for an aspherical shock front is further strengthened by the presence of a high-velocity broad absorption feature in the blue wing of the Balmer features in addition to the P-Cygni absorption post-16 days. Hydrodynamical light-curve modeling indicated a progenitor mass of 10 M⊙ with a radius of 470 R⊙ and explosion energy of 2 × 1051 erg, along with 0.06 M⊙ of 56 Ni, though these properties are not unique due to modeling degeneracies. The modeling also indicated a two-zone CSM: a confined dense CSM extending up to 5 × 1014 cm with a mass-loss rate of 10−2M⊙ yr−1 and an extended CSM spanning from 5 × 1014 to at least 1016 cm with a mass-loss rate of 10−4M⊙ yr−1, both assuming a wind-velocity of 10 km s−1. The early-nebular phase observations display an axisymmetric line profile of [O i], redward attenuation of the emission of Hα post 125 days, and flattening in the Ks-band, marking the onset of dust formation.

总结: 本研究探讨了高质量恒星从Roche波动溢出到二元黑洞系统的形成渠道。通过模拟和演化二元质量流，并将新的方法应用于半脱离高质量X射线双星M33 X-7，比较了不同溢出状态下的情况。结果表明极端溢出情况下是保守的，而稍微溢出的情况下是非保守的稳定质量传输，这表明现有假设可能误解了半脱离二元系统作为二元黑洞和共同包络前体的角色和分布。 <div>
While binary merger events have been an active area of study in both simulations and observational work, the formation channels by which a high-mass star extends from Roche lobe overflow (RLO) in a decaying orbit of a black-hole (BH) companion to a binary black-hole (BBH) system merits further investigation. Variable length-scales must be employed to accurately represent the dynamical fluid transfer and morphological development of the primary star as it conforms to a diminishing Roche lobe under the runaway influence of the proximal BH. We have simulated and evolved binary mass flow under these conditions to better identify the key transitional processes from RLO to BBHs. We demonstrate a new methodology to model RLO systems to unprecedented resolution simultaneously across the envelope, donor wind, tidal stream, and accretion disk regimes without reliance upon previously universal symmetry, mass flux, and angular momentum flux assumptions. We have applied this method to the semidetached high-mass X-ray binary M33 X-7 in order to provide a direct comparison to recent observations of an RLO candidate system at two overflow states of overfilling factors f = 1.01 and f = 1.1. We found extreme overflow (f = 1.1) to be entirely conservative in both mass and angular momentum transport, forming a conical L1 tidal stream of density and deflected angle comparable to existing predictions. This case lies within the unstable mass transfer (MT) regime as recently proposed of M33 X-7. The f = 1.01 case differed in stream geometry, accretion disk size, and efficiency, demonstrating nonconservative stable MT through a ballistic uniform-width stream. The nonconservative and stable nature of the f = 1.01 case MT also suggests that existing assumptions of semidetached binaries undergoing RLO may mischaracterize their role and distribution as progenitors of BBHs and common envelopes.

<div> 后验采样，贝叶斯方法，光度红移，星系性质，GPU加速<br />
<br />
这篇文章介绍了一个高效的贝叶斯方法，用于根据预先训练的种群模型(pop-cosmos)估算个别光度红移和星系性质。该模型使用基于分数的扩散模型规定了16个恒星种群合成（SPS）参数的先验分布，并包括对星云发射的详细处理数据模型。研究利用GPU加速的仿射不变合模器在COSMOS2020目录中的292,300个单独星系下，快速进行后验采样，利用神经网络模拟器(Speculator)加速SPS计算。比较了pop-cosmos种群模型和以Prospector-α为灵感的基准先验的结果，并将这些结果与广泛使用的EAZY和LePhare代码的已发布的COSMOS2020红移估计进行比较。针对具有光谱红移的∼12,000个星系，发现pop-cosmos给出了极小的偏差 (∼10−4)、高精度 (σMAD = 7 × 10−3) 和低离群值率 (1.6%)。研究表明pop-cosmos种群模型对比其r < 25 mag训练集更昏暗的星系具有良好的泛化能力。我们分析的样本比以前可能通过完整的SPS模型进行后验采样的样本大的约3倍，pop-cosmos先验下的平均吞吐量为每个星系15 GPU秒，而Prospector先验下为每个星系0.6 GPU秒。这为未来第四阶段星系调查中预期的大型目录的原则性建模铺平了道路。<br /><br />总结: 贝叶斯方法结合种群模型和GPU加速，实现了在大型星系目录中的高效后验采样，得到了准确的光度红移估计和星系性质推断，为未来的星系调查提供了重要的方法学基础。 <div>
We present an efficient Bayesian method for estimating individual photometric redshifts and galaxy properties under a pretrained population model (pop-cosmos) that was calibrated using purely photometric data. This model specifies a prior distribution over 16 stellar population synthesis (SPS) parameters using a score-based diffusion model, and includes a data model with detailed treatment of nebular emission. We use a GPU-accelerated affine-invariant ensemble sampler to achieve fast posterior sampling under this model for 292,300 individual galaxies in the COSMOS2020 catalog, leveraging a neural network emulator (Speculator) to speed up the SPS calculations. We apply both the pop-cosmos population model and a baseline prior inspired by Prospector-α, and compare these results to published COSMOS2020 redshift estimates from the widely used EAZY and LePhare codes. For the ∼12,000 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, we find that pop-cosmos yields redshift estimates that have minimal bias (∼10−4), high accuracy (σMAD = 7 × 10−3), and a low outlier rate (1.6%). We show that the pop-cosmos population model generalizes well to galaxies fainter than its r < 25 mag training set. The sample we have analyzed is ≳3× larger than has previously been possible via posterior sampling with a full SPS model, with average throughput of 15 GPU-sec per galaxy under the pop-cosmos prior, and 0.6 GPU-sec per galaxy under the Prospector prior. This paves the way for principled modeling of the huge catalogs expected from upcoming Stage IV galaxy surveys.

<title>Resolved UV and Optical Color Gradients Reveal Environmental Influence on Galaxy Evolution at Redshift z ∼ 1.6</title>

<div> 关键词: 银河系形成, 宇宙中午, 星际尘埃, 超级照相机, 颜色梯度
总结:
星系的颜色变化与其形成、增长、停滞历史和尘埃含量密切相关。在宇宙中午附近的 z ∼ 2 时期，星系的生长尤为重要，往往被称为“宇宙正午”，在这个时期星系平均达到了它们的星形成高峰。研究发现，我们在 z ∼ 1.6 附近的一个星团中观察到的星系，在 Hubble 太空望远镜的三个滤光片 F475W、F625W 和 F160W 中有明显的、具有统计学意义的差异。通过与类似红移的对照样本200个野外星系进行比较，我们发现了两种不同环境中星系的整体空间分辨率颜色和颜色梯度的明显差异。平均而言，星团中的星系在 r50 限定的内部和外部地区的紫外线颜色较红，同时外面向内的颜色梯度的离散程度更大。这些观察到的差异以及来自以前研究的辅助数据的证据强烈表明，环境通过影响恒星群和/或尘埃含量，驱动了这些整体颜色差异。 <div>
The changes in colors across a galaxy are intimately connected to the galaxy’s formation, growth, quenching history, and dust content. A particularly important epoch in the growth of galaxies is near z ∼ 2, often referred to as “cosmic noon,” where galaxies on average reach the peak of their star formation. We study a population of 125 cluster galaxies at z ∼ 1.6 in three Hubble Space Telescope filters, F475W, F625W, and F160W, roughly corresponding to the rest-frame far-ultraviolet, near-ultraviolet, and r band, respectively. By comparing to a control sample of 200 field galaxies at similar redshift, we reveal clear, statistically significant differences in the overall spatially resolved colors and color gradients in galaxies across these two different environments. On average, cluster galaxies have redder ultraviolet colors in both the inner and outer regions bounded by r50, as well as an overall wider dispersion of outside-in color gradients. The presence of these observed differences, along with evidence from ancillary data from previous studies, strongly suggests that the environment drives these population-level color differences, by affecting the stellar populations and/or dust content.

<div> 关键词: Coronal jets, solar atmosphere, magnetic reconnection, three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulation, eruptive events

总结: 论文报告了一个基于数据约束的三维磁流体力学模拟的结果，对太阳活动区NOAA AR12280中于2015年2月5日发生的一个喷发性射流进行了研究。通过模拟和差分发射测量分析结果的比较，提供了关于磁重连的启动和能谱特性的见解。研究捕捉了复杂的拓扑动力学，发现了喷流位置周围磁场和热演化之间的密切对应关系。这一综合方法丰富了对于由于磁流体力学过程引起的热演化的认识，对于揭示日冕加热问题有重要意义。 <br /><br /> <div>
Coronal jets are the captivating eruptions that are often found in the solar atmosphere and primarily formed due to magnetic reconnection. Despite their short-lived nature and lower energy compared to many other eruptive events, e.g., flares and coronal mass ejections, they play an important role in heating the corona and accelerating charged particles. However, their generation in the ambience of nonstandard flare regime is not fully understood, and warrant a deeper investigation, in terms of their onset, growth, eruption processes, and thermodynamic evolution. Toward this goal, this paper reports the results of a data-constrained three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation of an eruptive jet; initialized with a non-force-free-field (NFFF) extrapolation and carried out in the spirit of implicit large eddy simulation (ILES). The simulation focuses on the magnetic and dynamical properties of the jet during its onset, and eruption phases, that occurred on 2015 February 5 in an active region NOAA AR12280, associated with a seemingly three-ribbon structure. In order to correlate its thermal evolution with computed energetics, the simulation results are compared with differential emission measurement analysis in the vicinity of the jet. Importantly, this combined approach provides an insight to the onset of reconnection in transients in terms of emission and the corresponding electric current profiles from MHD evolutions. The presented study captures the intricate topological dynamics, finds a close correspondence between the magnetic and thermal evolution in and around the jet location. Overall, it enriches the understanding of the thermal evolution due to MHD processes, which is one of the broader aspects to reveal the coronal heating problem.

<br />
NGC 1266是一颗距离地球非常近的星后暴发星系，通过使用近红外积分场光谱仪进行观测，研究人员在中心区域探测到了H2 rovibrational发射线和弱的Brγ发射，这表明存在快速的持续性震撼活动。Brγ发射主要集中在中心区域，表明NGC 1266中可能仍存在星形成活动，而周围的冷分子气体则很少发生星形成。虽然不清楚Brγ发射的部分比例是来自于星形成还是活动星系核，假设完全来自于星形成活动，测得瞬时星形成率为0.7 M⊙ yr−1，然而在可能存在附加消光的情况下，星形成率可能会显著更高。NGC 1266是研究活动星系核、射流、震撼和星形成复杂相互作用的独特实验室，这些相互作用对于揭示星后暴发阶段演化过程至关重要。<br /><br />总结: NGC 1266是一颗星后暴发星系，观测结果显示存在持续的快速震撼活动和局部的星形成。通过研究这些复杂的相互作用，有助于了解星后暴发阶段的演化过程。 <div>
We present Gemini near-infrared integral field spectrograph K-band observations of the central 400 pc of NGC 1266, a nearby (D ≈ 30 Mpc) post-starburst galaxy with a powerful multiphase outflow and a shocked interstellar medium. We detect seven H2 rovibrational emission lines excited thermally to T ∼ 2000 K, and weak Brγ emission, consistent with a fast continuous shock (or C-shock). With these bright H2 lines, we observe the spatial structure of the shock with an unambiguous tracer for the first time. The Brγ emission is concentrated in the central ≲100 pc, indicating that any remaining star formation in NGC 1266 is in the nucleus, while the surrounding cold molecular gas has little ongoing star formation. Though it is unclear what fraction of this Brγ emission is from star formation or the active galactic nuclei (AGN), assuming it is entirely due to star formation we measure an instantaneous star formation rate of 0.7 M⊙ yr−1, though the star formation rate may be significantly higher in the presence of additional extinction. NGC 1266 provides a unique laboratory to study the complex interactions between AGN, outflows, shocks, and star formation, all of which are necessary to unravel the evolution of the post-starburst phase.

总结: 本文介绍了FAST在Commensal Radio Astronomy FAST Survey中发现的12颗脉冲星。对这些脉冲星进行了相位连通的定时计算、极化脉冲轮廓观测，以及法拉第旋转测量。其中发现了PSR J1840+2843存在亚脉冲漂移，而有五颗脉冲星表现出脉冲消失现象。此外，还发现两颗稳定自旋速率的孤立毫秒脉冲星，以及一对中子星-白矮星双星系统脉冲星。同时，FAST还发现了超出传统死亡线的两颗脉冲星，为测试脉冲星辐射理论提供了新样本。研究还根据NE2001和YMW16电子密度模型估算了这些脉冲星的距离，为研究银河系电子密度模型提供了数据。 <div>
We present phase-connected timing ephemerides, polarization pulse profiles, and Faraday rotation measurements of 12 pulsars discovered by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) in the Commensal Radio Astronomy FAST Survey. The observational data for each pulsar span at least 1 yr. Among them, PSR J1840+2843 shows subpulse drifting, and five pulsars are detected to exhibit pulse nulling phenomena. PSR J0640−0139 and PSR J2031−1254 are isolated millisecond pulsars (MSPs) with stable spin-down rates ( ) of 4.8981(6) × 10−20 s s−1 and 6.01(2) × 10−21 s s−1, respectively. Additionally, one pulsar (PSR J1602−0611) is in a neutron star−white dwarf (WD) binary system with an 18.23-day orbit and a companion of ≤0.65 M⊙. PSR J1602−0611 has a spin period, companion mass, and orbital eccentricity that are consistent with the theoretical expectations for MSP−helium WD (He WD) systems. Therefore, we believe that it might be an MSP−He WD binary system. The locations of PSR J1751−0542 and PSR J1840+2843 on the diagram are beyond the traditional death line. This indicates that FAST has discovered some low- pulsars, contributing new samples for testing pulsar radiation theories. We estimated the distances of these 12 pulsars based on NE2001 and YMW16 electron density models, and our work enhances the data set for investigating the electron density model of the Galaxy.

<br />
在这篇文章中，研究了原始黑洞（PBHs）对宇宙结构形成的影响，使用了半解析方法和宇宙学模拟。模拟中包含具有以10^6M⊙为中心的单色质量分布的PBHs，构成宇宙中10^-2到10^-4的暗物质（DM）部分，其余部分为无碰撞粒子暗物质。结果表明，PBHs对于引发大质量暗物质晕的形成并驻留在其中心具有“种子效应”。通过最近邻统计分析PBH宿主暗物质晕的相对分布，结果表明PBH宿主暗物质晕通过引力影响显著地影响了结构形成过程。如果PBHs构成的暗物质比例显著高于10^-3，几乎所有新形成的暗物质晕都会被PBH引发的晕吞并。因此，模拟预测了暗物质晕质量函数的双峰特征，其中大多数大质量暗物质晕的核心都包含至少一个PBH，其余为质量较小的非PBH暗物质晕。
<br /><br />总结: 原始黑洞对宇宙结构形成具有重要影响；模拟显示PBHs加速了大质量暗物质晕的形成；PBHs会影响新形成暗物质晕的分布；预测了暗物质晕质量函数的双峰特征。 <div>
We examine the effects of massive primordial black holes (PBHs) on cosmic structure formation, employing both a semianalytical approach and cosmological simulations. Our simulations incorporate PBHs with a monochromatic mass distribution centered around 106M⊙, constituting a fraction of 10−2 to 10−4 of the dark matter (DM) in the Universe, with the remainder being collisionless particle DM. Additionally, we conduct a ΛCDM simulation for comparative analysis with runs that include PBHs. At smaller scales, halos containing PBHs exhibit similar density and velocity dispersion profiles to those without PBHs. Conversely, at larger scales, PBHs can expedite the formation of massive halos and reside at their centers owing to the “seed effect.” To analyze the relative distribution of PBH host halos compared to non-PBH halos, we apply nearest neighbor statistics. Our results suggest that PBH host halos, through gravitational influence, significantly impact the structure formation process, compared to the ΛCDM case, by attracting and engulfing nearby newly formed minihalos. Should PBHs constitute a fraction of DM significantly larger than ∼10−3, almost all newly formed halos will be absorbed by PBH-seeded halos. Consequently, our simulations predict a bimodal feature in the halo mass function, with most of the massive halos containing at least one PBH at their core and the rest being less massive non-PBH halos.

We measure the absolute proper motion of Andromeda III (And III) using Advanced Camera for Surveys/Wide Field Channel and WFPC2 exposures spanning an unprecedented 22 yr time baseline. The WFPC2 exposures have been processed using a deep-learning centering procedure recently developed as well as an improved astrometric calibration of the camera. The absolute proper motion zero point is given by 98 galaxies and 16 Gaia EDR3 stars. The resulting proper motion is (μα, μδ) = (−10.5 ± 12.5, 47.5 ± 12.5) μas yr−1. We perform an orbit analysis of And III using two estimates of M31's mass and proper motion. We find that And III’s orbit is consistent with dynamical membership to the Great Plane of Andromeda system of satellites although with some looser alignment compared to the previous two satellites NGC 147 and NGC 185. And III is bound to M31 if M31's mass is Mvir ≥ 1.5 × 1012M⊙.

总结: 本文讨论了标准宇宙学模型在哈勃常数H0的超新星测量和宇宙微波背景辐射推断之间的张力，以及对当今宇宙加速的多种解释所需的新基本标量场的存在。作者提出了一个级联暗能量场景，通过将其简化为一个双场模型，并将其与宇宙微波背景辐射和宇宙中的测量结果进行比较，发现该场景改善了哈勃张力，提高了暗能量模型和宇宙中的测量结果之间的一致性。  <div>
The standard cosmological model is in the midst of a stress test, thanks to the tension between supernova-based measurements of the Hubble constant H0 and inferences of its values from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. Numerous explanations for the present-day cosmic acceleration require the presence of a new fundamental scalar field, as do early dark energy solutions to the Hubble tension. This raises the possibility that multiple fields cooperatively contribute to the dark energy component in bursts throughout cosmic time due to distinct initial conditions and couplings. Here, this cascading dark energy scenario is illustrated through a realization that effectively reduces to a two-field model, with two epochs in which dark energy is cosmologically significant. The model is compared to measurements of the CMB and baryon acoustic oscillations, as well as both PANTHEON and SH0ES observations of Type Ia supernovae. Neglecting the linear perturbations, it is found that this scenario ameliorates the Hubble tension, improving over purely late-time models of dark energy and the agreement between the galaxy survey measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations.

总结:<br /><br />本研究分析了围绕HD 111520星的不对称碎片盘，发现其中存在受行星-盘相互作用影响的结构和不对称性。使用REBOUND模拟了复杂的盘形态，以限制可能导致观测结构的行星的质量和轨道。研究发现，一个大约1木星质量、轨道离盘面有倾角的偏心行星可以重现大部分盘特征，包括弯曲、分叉和径向延伸的不对称性。另外，需要一个内部偏心行星才能产生亮度不对称，但无法完全重现观测到的2:1亮度不对称，这可能需要另一个机制。这项工作展示了仅凭碎片盘形态就可以了解整个系统的结构和演化，还可以提供行星约束，确定JWST/NIRCam和吉米尼行星成像仪2.0等当前/未来仪器的潜在目标。 <div>
Debris disks, which are optically thin, dusty disks around main-sequence stars, are often found to have structures and/or asymmetries associated with planet–disk interactions. Debris disk morphologies can hence be used as probes for planets in these systems, which are unlikely to be detected with other current exoplanet detection methods. In this study we take a look at the very asymmetrical debris disk around HD 111520, which harbours several signs of perturbation such as a “fork”-like structure in the NW, as well as a 4° warp from the midplane on either side of the disk. We simulate the complicated disk morphology using the code REBOUND, with the goal of constraining the possible mass and orbit of the planet responsible for the observed structures. We find that an ∼1 Mjup, eccentric planet that is inclined relative to the disk and is orbiting outside the warp location is able to reproduce the majority of disk features including the warp, fork, and radial extent asymmetry. To create the surface brightness asymmetry, a second eccentric planet is required inside the disk inner edge (50 au), although we are unable to produce the 2:1 brightness asymmetry observed, suggesting that a second mechanism may be required. Our work demonstrates how debris disk morphologies alone can be used to learn more about the architecture and evolution of a system as a whole, and can provide planet constraints to determine potential targets for current/future instruments such as JWST/NIRCam and the Gemini Planet Imager 2.0.

<title>Star Stream Velocity Distributions in Cold Dark Matter and Warm Dark Matter Galactic Halos</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The dark matter subhalos orbiting in a galactic halo perturb the orbits of stars in thin stellar streams. Over time, the random velocities in the streams develop non-Gaussian wings. The rate of velocity increase is approximately a random walk at a rate proportional to the number of subhalos, primarily those in the mass range ≈106−7M⊙. The distribution of random velocities in long streams is measured in simulated Milky Way–like halos that develop in representative warm dark matter (WDM) and cold dark matter (CDM) cosmologies. The radial velocity distributions are well modeled as the sum of a Gaussian and an exponential. The resulting Markov Chain Monte Carlo fits find Gaussian cores of 1−2 km s−1 and exponential wings that increase from 3 km s−1 for 5.5 keV WDM, 4 km s−1 for 7 keV WDM, to 6 km s−1 for a CDM halo. The observational prospects to use stream measurements to constrain the nature of galactic dark matter are discussed.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The natural variation in plasma parameters observed at 1 au can lead to a variation in transport parameters, such as diffusion and drift coefficients, for energetic charged particles of solar and galactic origin. Given the importance of these parameters to particle transport studies, this variation is investigated through test particle simulations over a range of energies in the presence of simulated turbulence with properties corresponding to an ensemble of observed turbulence conditions at Earth. The resulting transport coefficients are then compared with observational estimates from the literature, as well as the predictions of several scattering theories. Parallel and perpendicular mean free paths are shown to vary widely, for the former in agreement with prior observational estimates, but not for the latter. Furthermore, a large disparity between the predictions of theory and the simulation results is noted for the perpendicular mean free path. As such, these results indicate that particle transport studies, particularly predictive ones, need to take into account this natural variation in transport coefficients.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study investigates the active regions of the M3.0V star G 80–21 using the observed data from the CARMENES project with synthetic spectra generated by the RH1.5D radiative transfer code. The CARMENES project aims to search for exoplanets around M dwarfs using high-resolution near-infrared and optical echelle spectrographs. By comparing the observed data and models for the chromospheric lines of Hα and the bluest Ca ii infrared triplet line, we obtain the best-fit models for this star. The optimal fitting for the observed spectrum of G 80–21 is achieved by employing two active areas in conjunction with an inactive region, with a calcium abundance of [Ca/H] = −0.4. This combination successfully fits all the observed data across varying ratios. The minor active component consistently comprises approximately 18% of the total (ranging from 14% to 20%), which suggests that the minor active component is likely located in the polar regions. Meanwhile, the major active component occupies a variable proportion, ranging from 51% to 82%. Our method allows for the determination of the structure and size of stellar chromospheric active regions by analyzing high-resolution observed spectra.

本文介绍了引力波天文学的到来以及越来越多以时间为重点的天文台观测的到来，这将导致对于与地球有适度倾斜的短γ射线暴（GRBs）的探测数量增加。由于这些事件距离我们很近，它们也是非常适合进行长期跟踪观测和长基线干涉测量的主要候选对象，这对于多信使建模、数据分析和应用于这些源的统计推断方法具有重要意义。文章更新了全面的建模，直接将GRB位置的星表观测、微弱源的泊松统计以及跨相对论电子种群的建模纳入到afterglowpy中。作者使用了革命性事件GW170817来展示这些扩展对于最佳拟合物理参数和模型选择方法的影响，这些方法评估了额外的迟发射分量的统计显著性。通过在分析中包括对GRB 170817A的最新Chandra X射线观测，作者发现在后期仅存在一些微弱证据（≲2σ）支持存在新的发射组分，这对于中心演化和外部介质密度预测更加自然。 <div>
The arrival of gravitational wave astronomy and a growing number of time-domain-focused observatories are set to lead to an increasing number of detections of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) launched with a moderate inclination to Earth. Being nearby events, these are also prime candidates for very long-term follow-up campaigns and very long-baseline interferometry, which has implications for multi-messenger modeling, data analysis, and statistical inference methods applied to these sources. Here, we present a comprehensive modeling update that directly incorporates into afterglowpy astrometric observations of the GRB position, Poissonian statistics for faint sources, and modeling of a trans-relativistic population of electrons. We use the revolutionary event GW170817 to demonstrate the impact of these extensions both for the best-fit physics parameters and model selection methods that assess the statistical significance of additional late-time emission components. By including in our analysis the latest Chandra X-ray observations of GRB 170817A, we find only weak evidence (≲2σ) for a new emission component at late times, which makes for a slightly more natural fit to the centroid evolution and prediction for the external medium density.

本文利用哈勃太空望远镜（HST）的空间望远镜成像光谱仪（STIS）光谱和宽视场相机3（WFC3）图像对15个附近（z <0.02）活动星系核（AGN）的狭线区域（NLR）和宿主星系的相互作用进行了研究。通过结合11个AGN的新HST WFC3连续光谱和[O III] λ5007图像，以及四个存档的AGN，与现有的HST STIS光谱相匹配。对六个AGN进行了适当的NLR长缝覆盖，并使用地面的等光面拟合图像、去除连续波段的[O III]图像和STIS光谱，解决、测量并将气体动力学投影到宿主星系盘面上，并区分NLR流出和星系旋转和/或动力学扰动的气体。研究发现，[O III]的平均范围约为680光年，与[O III]的亮度呈正相关。测得的范围强烈依赖于[O III]图像的深度，突出了在分析比例关系时采用统一阈值的重要性。流出气体的范围达到了NLR范围的39%至88%，并且发现所有六个具有其整个NLR的STIS覆盖的AGN都显示出强烈的流出动力学证据，尽管对于这些AGN以前存在不确定性。这表明NLR流出在中等光度AGN中普遍存在，并且标准的动力学建模标准对于识别流出是至关重要的。<br /><br />总结: 本研究利用Hubble Space Telescope对附近的活动星系核进行了研究，发现NLR流出在中等光度AGN中普遍存在，实现了对NLR动力学的测量和解析。流出范围与[O III]的亮度呈正相关，通过流出的测量，提出了标准的动力学建模标准。 <div>
Outflowing gas from supermassive black holes in the centers of active galaxies has been postulated as a major contributor to galactic evolution. To explore the interaction between narrow-line region (NLR) outflows and their host galaxies, we use Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) spectra and Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) images of 15 nearby (z < 0.02) active galactic nuclei (AGN) to determine the extents and geometries of their NLRs. We combine new HST WFC3 continuum and [O iii] λ5007 images of 11 AGN with four archival AGN to match existing spectra from HST STIS. For the six AGN with suitable long-slit coverage of their NLRs, we use isophotal fitting of ground-based images, continuum-subtracted [O iii] images, and the STIS spectra, to resolve, measure, and de-project the gas kinematics to the plane of the host galaxy disk and distinguish NLR outflows from galaxy rotation and/or kinematically disturbed gas. We find an average [O iii] extent of ∼680 pc with a correlation between gas extent and [O iii] luminosity of R[O III] ∝ . The measured extents depend strongly on the depth of the [O iii] images, highlighting the importance of adopting uniform thresholds when analyzing scaling relationships. The outflows reach from 39% to 88% of the full NLR extents, and we find that all six of the AGN with STIS coverage of their entire NLRs show strong kinematic evidence for outflows, despite previous uncertainty for these AGN. This suggests that NLR outflows are ubiquitous in moderate-luminosity AGN and that standard criteria for kinematic modeling are essential for identifying outflows.

<br />
总结: <br />
这篇文章讨论了软X射线（能量小于2keV）的高分辨率光谱需要采用衍射元件来解析天体物理学相关的诊断信息。Rowland准则描述了光栅和探测器的最佳位置以优化光谱分辨能力。文章提出了一种双倾斜Rowland光谱仪的概念，允许两个通道共享相同的探测器，并可以减少构建仪器时的对准要求。这种双倾斜Rowland光谱仪的概念对于次孔径镜特别有用，因为它可以有效利用航天器的入口孔径。其中应用了这一概念的任务之一是Arcus探测器。 <div>
High-resolution spectroscopy in soft X-rays (<2 keV) requires diffractive elements to resolve any astrophysically relevant diagnostics, such as closely spaced lines, weak absorption lines, or line profiles. The Rowland torus geometry describes how gratings and detectors need to be positioned to optimize the spectral resolving power. We describe how an on-axis Rowland geometry can be tilted to accommodate blazed gratings. In this geometry, two channels with separate optical axes can share the same detectors (double tilted Rowland spectrograph). Small offsets between the channels can mitigate the effect of chip gaps and reduce the alignment requirements during the construction of the instrument. The double tilted Rowland spectrograph concept is especially useful for subapertured mirrors, because it allows an effective use of space in the entrance aperture of a spacecraft. One mission that applies this concept is the Arcus Probe.

太阳辐射 总体趋势 卫星观测 数据复合 变化趋势
要点1: 自1978年以来进行了多次总太阳辐射（TSI）卫星任务
要点2: 不同卫星任务产生了略有不同的TSI基线和变化趋势
要点3: 出现了不同的数据复合策略和调整方法
要点4: 基于卫星数据产生了21种TSI时间序列
要点5: 开发了新的TSI数据集供科学界使用，提供了不同分辨率和版本

在自1978年以来的太阳总辐射（TSI）卫星任务中，各个任务产生了略有不同的TSI基线和变化趋势。一些团队通过调整单个任务的数据，显著减少了这些差异，而其他团队则更倾向于使用卫星科学小组发布的原始数据。这些数据组合方式也有所不同，有的将矛盾记录平均在一起，而有的更看重特定记录。研究人员比较了四种现有的组合数据以及基于可用卫星数据的17种新的替代系列。这些21个TSI系列被统计分为了6组，每组3到4个系列。研究发现，这六个组揭示了不同的太阳最小期间的变化趋势。研究人员还将这些组与八个每日分辨的太阳长期预测TSI重构和每日太阳黑子数进行了比较。他们发现，在一到两个太阳周期内取得了良好的一致性，但在更长的时间尺度上存在显著差异。因此，研究人员将所有这些时间序列（新旧）汇集成了一个大型的新TSI数据集，供科学界使用。这个数据集提供了不同分辨率和版本，可以比较地表的太阳变化或太阳与地球相互作用。 <div>
Several total solar irradiance (TSI) satellite missions have been carried out since 1978. None of these missions have lasted more than one to two solar cycles (SCs), and each mission implies a slightly different absolute TSI baseline. Nonetheless, several satellite composites have been developed by compositing satellite data from different missions to form an almost continuous daily record for the satellite era. However, disconcertingly, each mission has implied slightly different changes in TSI between consecutive solar minima and solar maxima. Some groups have developed adjustments to individual missions that have substantially reduced these differences. Others prefer to use the original data published by the satellite science teams. Some TSI composites average together conflicting records, while others prioritize specific records over others. Here, we compare four existing composites to 17 new alternative series based on the available satellite data. These 21 TSI series are statistically sorted into six groups of three to four series each. We found that the six groups suggest different intercycle trends between solar minima. We compare the groups to eight daily resolved solar proxy-based TSI reconstructions and to daily sunspot numbers. Excellent agreement is obtained over one to two SCs, but significant differences are observed over longer timescales for each group. Therefore, we have assembled all these time series (old and new) into a large and new TSI data set for use by the scientific community. Versions scaled to 1 au (for studying solar variability) or in situ values at Earth (for studying solar/terrestrial interactions) are provided at daily, monthly, and yearly resolutions.

中文总结: 
本文研究了太阳风中核心和晕带电子的温度各向异性是如何受碰撞和不稳定激励的综合影响而调节的。观察到太阳风核心/晕带电子在（β∥，T⊥/T∥）相空间中的分布受到外部边界的限制。文章提供了关于低β∥边界的基线解释，基于碰撞松弛过程。通过结合不稳定性和碰撞动力学，文章充分解释了太阳风电子在（β∥，T⊥/T∥）相空间中的观测分布。 <div>
Typical solar wind electrons are modeled as being composed of a dense but less energetic thermal “core” population plus a tenuous but energetic “halo” population with varying degrees of temperature anisotropies for both species. In this paper, we seek a fundamental explanation of how these solar wind core and halo electron temperature anisotropies are regulated by combined effects of collisions and instability excitations. The observed solar wind core/halo electron data in (β∥, T⊥/T∥) phase space show that their respective occurrence distributions are confined within an area enclosed by outer boundaries. Here, T⊥/T∥ is the ratio of perpendicular and parallel temperatures and β∥ is the ratio of parallel thermal energy to background magnetic field energy. While it is known that the boundary on the high-β∥ side is constrained by the temperature anisotropy-driven plasma instability threshold conditions, the low-β∥ boundary remains largely unexplained. The present paper provides a baseline explanation for the low-β∥ boundary based upon the collisional relaxation process. By combining the instability and collisional dynamics it is shown that the observed distribution of the solar wind electrons in the (β∥, T⊥/T∥) phase space is adequately explained, both for the “core” and “halo” components.

总结: <br /><br />这篇文章报告了使用XMM-Newton卫星上的Reflection Grating Spectrometer对原型星暴星系M82进行的深度观测，发现了一个快速的软X射线风。通过对O viii、Ne x和Mg xii等发射线的拟合，测量了氧、氖和镁等元素的速度分散，指出了氧具有显著高于逃逸速度的风速，而氖和镁的速度宽度较小，暗示了更低的风速或更小的开启角度。未来的研究将结合X射线成像和分光任务中的Resolve微量热传导仪观测结果，来进一步了解M82中的热星暴风的相位结构和能量预算。 <div>
Starburst wind models predict that metals and energy are primarily carried out of the disk by hot gas (T > 106 K), but the low energy resolution of X-ray CCD observations results in large uncertainties on the mass and energy loading. Here, we present evidence for a fast soft X-ray wind from the prototypical starburst galaxy M82 using deep archival observations from the Reflection Grating Spectrometer on XMM-Newton. After characterizing the complex line-spread function for the spatially extended outflow ( ), we perform emission-line fitting to measure the velocity dispersion, σv, from O viii (0.65, 0.77 keV), Ne x (1.02 keV), and Mg xii (1.47 keV). For the T ≈ 3 × 106 K gas, O viii yields a velocity dispersion of km s−1, implying a wind speed that is significantly above the escape velocity (vesc ≲ 450 km s−1). Ne x ( km s−1) and Mg xii (σv < 370 km s−1) show less velocity broadening than O viii, hinting at a lower wind speed or smaller opening angle on the more compact spatial scales traced by the T ≈ (0.6−1) × 107 K gas. Alternatively, these higher energy emission lines may be dominated by shock-heated gas in the interstellar medium. Future synthesis of these measurements with performance verification observations of the E = 2−12 keV wind in M82 from the Resolve microcalorimeter on the X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission will inform the phase structure and energy budget of the hot starburst wind.

<div> 双爆炸，白矮星，撞击，超新星，模拟
总结:
本研究利用多维双爆炸模拟构建了真实的C/O白矮星，作为双爆炸模拟的起点。经过简化的一维爆炸计算，得出了壳层爆炸可以成功传播的条件。研究发现，大多数C/O白矮星可以支持双爆炸，而更大质量的C/O白矮星需要一定量的吸积才能成功传播爆炸。此外，研究强烈暗示，如果直接冲击吸积流在质量转移过程中达到足够高的温度和密度，吸积的白矮星将经历双爆炸。此外，如果伴星也是C/O白矮星，它在第一次爆炸的喷发影响下将经历自己的双爆炸。一些例外情况可能解释了新发现的高速超新星幸存者。 <div>
Double detonations of sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs (WDs) in unstably mass-transferring double WD binaries have become one of the leading contenders to explain most Type Ia supernovae. However, past theoretical studies of the explosion process have assumed relatively ad hoc initial conditions for the helium shells in which the double detonations begin. In this work, we construct realistic C/O WDs to use as the starting points for multidimensional double detonation simulations. We supplement these with simplified one-dimensional detonation calculations to gain a physical understanding of the conditions under which shell detonations can propagate successfully. We find that C/O WDs ≲1.0 M⊙, which make up the majority of C/O WDs, are born with structures that can support double detonations. More massive C/O WDs require ∼10−3M⊙ of accretion before detonations can successfully propagate in their shells, but such accretion may be common in the double WD binaries that host massive WDs. Our findings strongly suggest that if the direct impact accretion stream reaches high enough temperatures and densities during mass transfer from one WD to another, the accreting WD will undergo a double detonation. Furthermore, if the companion is also a C/O WD ≲1.0 M⊙, it will undergo its own double detonation when impacted by the ejecta from the first explosion. Exceptions to this outcome may explain the newly discovered class of hypervelocity supernova survivors.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了外部原行星盘中出现的阴影现象对盘内动力学的影响。他们通过进行二维模拟发现，阴影的线性响应是双臂螺旋，而在非线性阶段，阴影可能导致形成各种类型的亚结构，包括环状、螺旋状和新月形。研究还表明，随着阴影造成的热力迫使加强，盘内的主要亚结构形式会从螺旋转变为环状，最终变成新月形或漩涡。这些结果强调了正确建模不均匀恒星辐射的重要性，同时呼吁进行更加详细的模拟以包含更真实的盘物理学。 <div>
There has been increasing evidence of shadows from scattered light observations of outer protoplanetary disks (PPDs) cast from the (unresolved) disk inner region, while in the meantime these disks present substructures of various kinds in the submillimeter. As stellar irradiation is the primary heating source for the outer PPDs, the presence of such shadows thus suggests inhomogeneous heating of the outer disk in azimuth, leading to a “thermal forcing” with dynamical consequences. We conduct a suite of idealized two-dimensional disk simulations of the outer disk with azimuthally varying cooling prescription to mimic the effect of shadows, generally assuming the shadow is static or slowly rotating. The linear response to such shadows is two-armed spirals with the same pattern speed as the shadow. Toward the nonlinear regime, we find that shadows can potentially lead to the formation of a variety of types of substructures including rings, spirals, and crescents, depending on viscosity, cooling time, etc. We have conducted systematic and statistical characterization of the simulation suite, and as thermal forcing from the shadow strengthens, the dominant form of shadow-induced disk substructures change from spirals to rings, and eventually to crescents/vortices. Our results highlight the importance of properly modeling the dynamical impact of inhomogeneous stellar irradiation, while calling for more detailed modeling incorporating more realistic disk physics.

Radio phoenices are complex and filamentary diffuse radio sources found in both merging and relaxed clusters. The formation of these sources has been proposed to be due to adiabatic compression of old active galactic nucleus plasma in shock waves. Most of the previous spectral studies of these sources have been limited to integrated spectral indices, which were found to be very steep and show a curved spectrum. Here, we have performed a multifrequency investigation of the radio phoenix in the A85 cluster. Owing to the sensitive high-resolution observations, we found some of the finer filamentary structures that had been previously undetected. We produced resolved spectral index maps of the radio phoenix between 323, 700, and 1280 MHz. The orientation of the filaments, as well as the gradient across the spectral index maps, suggest the possible direction of the shock motion from northeast to southwest. The integrated spectrum of the radio phoenix was found to be very steep and curved toward high frequencies. Furthermore, the spectral index of the filaments was found to be less steep compared to the nonfilamentary regions, implying greater energy injection in the filaments. The observed features in the radio phoenix in the A85 cluster seem to be in support of an adiabatic shock compression mechanism.

总结:<br />这篇论文研究了一个巨大的S0星系PGC 39535，发现其星形成主要集中在中心区域，估计总星形成速率为1.57 M⊙ yr−1。通过NOEMA观测发现，分子气体主要集中在中心区域，呈现出类似的运动学特性。总分子气体质量为(5.42 ± 1.52) × 10^9M⊙。PGC 39535处于星形成主序上，但低于螺旋星系的Kennicutt–Schmidt关系，表明星形成效率可能受到巨大的星团的抑制。此外，分析结果表明PGC 39535位于一个巨大星系团的中心，其星形成历史表明它可能在过去的2-7亿年里经历了一系列富含气体的合并。 <div>
Lenticular galaxies (S0s) in the local Universe are generally absent of recent star formation and lack molecular gas. In this paper, we investigate one massive (M* ∼ 5 × 1010M⊙) star-forming S0, PGC 39535, with the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA). Using optical data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV Mapping Nearby Galaxies at the Apache Point Observatory survey, we find star formation mainly concentrates in the central region of PGC 39535. The total star formation rate estimated using extinction-corrected Hα flux is 1.57 M⊙ yr−1. The results of the NOEMA observation suggest that the molecular gas mainly concentrates in the central regions as a gaseous bar and a ring-like structure, and shows similar kinematics as the stellar and ionized gas components. The total molecular gas mass estimated from CO(1–0) is (5.42 ± 1.52) × 109M⊙. We find PGC 39535 lies on the star-forming main sequence but falls below the Kennicutt–Schmidt relation of spiral galaxies, suggesting that the star formation efficiency may be suppressed by the massive bulge. The existence of a second Gaussian component in the CO spectrum of the central region indicates possible gas flows. Furthermore, our analyses suggest that PGC 39535 resides in the center of a massive group and the derived star formation history indicates it may experience a series of gas-rich mergers over the past 2–7 Gyr.

这篇文章研究了中子星与暗物质存在的可能性。作者使用相对论中的双流体形式，通过数值模拟稳定的暗物质掺杂中子星的配置。他们探讨了不同暗物质模型对暗物质质量分布的影响，以及暗物质对X射线流量的影响。研究结果表明，暗物质的存在可能会影响中子星质量和半径的测量，以及对强子物质方程状态的约束。总结：<br /><br /> <div>
The high densities of neutron stars (NSs) could provide astrophysical locations for dark matter (DM) to accumulate. Depending on the DM model, these DM admixed NSs (DANSs) could have significantly different properties than pure baryonic NSs, accessible through X-ray observations of rotation-powered pulsars. We adopt the two-fluid formalism in general relativity to numerically simulate stable configurations of DANSs, assuming a fermionic equation of state (EOS) for the DM with repulsive self-interaction. The distribution of DM in the DANS as a halo affects the path of X-rays emitted from hot spots on the visible baryonic surface, causing notable changes in the pulse profile observed by telescopes such as NICER, compared to pure baryonic NSs. We explore how various DM models affect the DM mass distribution, leading to different types of dark halos. We quantify the deviation in observed X-ray flux from stars with each of these halos. We identify the pitfalls in interpreting mass and radius measurements of NSs inferred from electromagnetic radiation and constraining the baryonic matter EOS if these dark halos exist.

<div> 太阳，射电辐射，空间结构，观测，辐射爆发
<br /><br />总结: 本研究利用升级的Giant Metrewave射电望远镜的高角分辨率观测，发现可以探测到角尺度小至约9″的结构，比以往关于太阳射电辐射爆发观测报告的最小结构约小了三倍。观测结果表明，虽然单个I型爆发具有窄带特性，但这些爆发可能是由于在不同日冕高度诱发磁重联的行进扰动导致的，因此导致在广泛频率范围内观察到的I型爆发的形态发生相关变化。这一发现对于与极紫外线/ X射线波段的观测进行时空关联，以了解这些辐射的详细性质非常重要。 <div>
Type-I solar noise storms are perhaps the most commonly observed active radio emissions from the Sun at meter-wavelengths. Noise storms have a long-lived and wideband continuum background with superposed islands of much brighter narrowband and short-lived emissions, known as type-I bursts. There is a serious paucity of studies focusing on the morphology of these two types of emissions, primarily because of the belief that coronal scattering will always wash out any features at small angular scales. However, it is important to investigate their spatial structures in detail to make a spatio-temporal connection with observations at extreme-ultraviolet/X-ray bands to understand the detailed nature of these emissions. In this work, we use high angular resolution observations from the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope to demonstrate that it is possible to detect structures with angular scales as small as ∼9″, about three times smaller than the smallest structure reported to date from noise storms. Our observations also suggest that while the individual type-I bursts are narrowband in nature, the bursts are probably caused by traveling disturbance(s) inducing magnetic reconnections at different coronal heights, and thus leading to correlated change in the morphology of the type-I bursts observed at a wide range of frequencies.

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has enabled the discovery of numerous tidally tilted pulsators (TTPs), which are pulsating stars in close binaries where the presence of a tidal bulge has the effect of tilting the primary star’s pulsation axes into the orbital plane. Recently, the modeling framework developed to analyze TTPs has been applied to the emerging class of triaxial pulsators, which exhibit nonradial pulsations about three perpendicular axes. In this work, we report on the identification of the second-ever discovered triaxial pulsator, with 16 robustly detected pulsation multiplets, of which 14 are dipole doublets separated by 2νorb. We jointly fit the spectral energy distribution and TESS light curve of the star, and find that the primary is slightly evolved off the zero-age main sequence, while the less massive secondary still lies on the zero-age main sequence. Of the 14 doublets, we associate eight with Y10x modes and six with novel Y10y modes. We exclude the existence of Y11x modes in this star and show that the observed pulsation modes must be Y10y. We also present a toy model for the triaxial pulsation framework in the context of this star. The techniques presented here can be utilized to rapidly analyze and confirm future triaxial pulsator candidates.

这项研究通过分类方法确定了产生 OX 和 CX 结构的特定轨道族群，发现两种 BP/X 形态都与 x1 轨道族有关，但是 OX 结构对应的轨道具有更高的角动量。研究还表明，随着杆减速，高角动量的 OX 支持轨道的贡献减少，形态演化为 CX。如果杆不减速，则BP/X 结构形态和 OX/CX 支持轨道的比例基本保持不变。对于减速但不发生屈曲的杆来说，最初显示 OX 结构并被高角动量的轨道所主导，随后过渡为 CX 形态。而发生屈曲的杆在屈曲后立即显示出 OX- 和 CX-支持轨道的组合，随着其图样速度的降低更多地变为 CX 主导。这项研究表明，BP/X 形态和轨道族群的演化在很大程度上取决于杆角动量的演化。

Barred galaxies exhibit boxy/peanut or X-shapes (BP/X) protruding from their disks in edge-on views. Two types of BP/X morphologies exist depending on whether the X-wings meet at the center (CX) or are off-centered (OX). Orbital studies indicate that various orbital types can generate X-shaped structures. Here we provide a classification approach that identifies the specific orbit families responsible for generating OX- and CX-shaped structures. Applying this approach to three different N-body bar models, we show that both OX and CX structures are associated with the x1 orbit family, but OX-supporting orbits possess higher angular momentum (closer to x1 orbits) than orbits in CX structures. Consequently, as the bar slows down, the contribution of higher angular momentum OX-supporting orbits decreases and that of lower angular momentum orbits increases, resulting in an evolution of the morphology from OX to CX. If the bar does not slow down, the shape of the BP/X structure and the fractions of OX/CX-supporting orbits remain substantially unchanged. Bars that do not undergo buckling but that do slow down initially show the OX structure and are dominated by high angular momentum orbits, transitioning to a CX morphology. Bars that buckle exhibit a combination of both OX- and CX-supporting orbits immediately after the buckling but become more CX dominated as their pattern speed decreases. This study demonstrates that the evolution of BP/X morphology and orbit populations strongly depends on the evolution of the bar angular momentum.

<title>Probing the Dust Grain Alignment Mechanisms in Spiral Galaxies with M51 as the Case Study</title>

Magnetic fields (B fields) in galaxies have recently been traced using far-infrared and submillimeter polarimetric observations with the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The main assumption is that dust grains are magnetically aligned with the local B-field in the interstellar medium (ISM). However, the range of physical conditions of the ISM, dust grain sizes, and B-field strengths in galaxies where this assumption is valid has not been characterized yet. Here, we use the well-studied spiral galaxy M51 as a case study. We find that the timescale for the alignment mechanism arising from magnetically aligned dust grains (B-RAT) dominates over other alignment mechanisms, including radiative precession (k-RAT) and mechanical alignment (v-MAT), as well as the randomization effect (gas damping). We estimate the sizes of the aligned dust grain to be in the range of 0.009–0.182 μm and 0.019–0.452 μm for arms and interarms, respectively. We show that the difference in the polarization fraction between arms and interarms may arise from the enhancement of small dust grain sizes in the arms resulting from large grains being broken into small grains as an effect of the grain alignment disruption (RAT-D) mechanism. We argue that the RAT-D mechanism needs to have additional effects, e.g., intrinsic variations of the B-field structure and turbulence, in the galaxy’s components to fully explain the polarization fraction variations within the arms and interarms.

<br />总结: 该研究调查了涡度生成机制以及涡旋管在等离子体加热和能量传输中的作用。通过对太阳光球模拟区域的数据进行分析，发现在三维动能涡旋管中，磁压力的错位和密度梯度的倒数主要驱动了涡度。在模拟的上光球层，洛伦兹力对绝热冷却和加热产生影响。此外，结果表明涡旋可以显著提高光球区间比例尺的粘性和欧姆加热，并产生更多的磁能。在能量传递方面，Poynting流在涡旋边界处非均匀且占主导地位，这创造了能量循环，支持色球等离子体加热并维持色球温度。 <div>
This study investigated the mechanisms of vorticity generation and the role of vortex tubes in plasma heating and energy transport. Vortex tubes were identified using the instantaneous vorticity deviation technique in the MURaM data set of a simulated solar plage region of the solar photosphere. Within 3D kinetic vortex tubes, the misalignment of the magnetic pressure and the inverse of the density gradient, rather than baroclinic effects, primarily drive vorticity within the tubes. During their lifetime, vortices become less dense as the Lorentz force pushes plasma outwards against pressure gradients. In the simulated upper photosphere, the Lorentz force contributes to adiabatic cooling and heating by expanding or compressing the plasma around the vortex tubes. In turn, vortex motion affects the magnetic field, enhancing current generation and intensifying the Lorentz force, which may further increase adiabatic cooling and heating. Moreover, our results confirm that vortices can significantly boost viscous and ohmic heating on intergranular scales in the photosphere. They generate more magnetic than kinetic energy, with energy transport by Poynting flux notably nonuniform and dominant at the vortex boundaries. This creates energy circulation in which the net upwards Poynting flux can enhance chromospheric plasma heating and support chromospheric temperatures.

We propose a Bayesian inference framework to predict the merger history of LIGO-Virgo binary black holes (BHs), whose binary components may have undergone hierarchical mergers in the past. The framework relies on numerical relativity predictions for the mass, spin, and kick velocity of the remnant BHs. This proposed framework computes the masses, spins, and kicks imparted to the remnant of the parent binaries, given the initial masses and spin magnitudes of the binary constituents. We validate our approach by performing an “injection study” based on a constructed sequence of hierarchically formed binaries. Noise is added to the final binary in the sequence, and the parameters of the “parent” and “grandparent” binaries in the merger chain are then reconstructed. This method is then applied to three GWTC-3 events: GW190521, GW200220_061928, and GW190426_190642. These events were selected because at least one of the binary companions lies in the putative pair-instability supernova mass gap, in which stellar processes alone cannot produce BHs. Hierarchical mergers offer a natural explanation for the formation of BHs in the pair-instability mass gap. We use the backward evolution framework to predict the parameters of the parents of the primary companion of these three binaries. For instance, the parent binary of GW190521 has masses and within the 90% credible interval. Astrophysical environments with escape speeds ≥100 km s−1 are preferred sites to host these events. Our approach can be readily applied to future high-mass gravitational wave events to predict their formation history under the hierarchical merger assumption.

We compare two-moment-based energy-dependent and three variants of energy-integrated neutrino transport general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of a hypermassive neutron star. To study the impacts due to the choice of the neutrino transport schemes, we perform simulations with the same setups and input neutrino microphysics. We show that the main differences between energy-dependent and energy-integrated neutrino transport are found in the disk and ejecta properties, as well as in the neutrino signals. The properties of the disk surrounding the neutron star and the ejecta in energy-dependent transport are very different from the ones obtained using energy-integrated schemes. Specifically, in the energy-dependent case, the disk is more neutron-rich at early times and becomes geometrically thicker at later times. In addition, the ejecta is more massive and, on average, more neutron-rich in the energy-dependent simulations. Moreover, the average neutrino energies and luminosities are about 30% higher. Energy-dependent neutrino transport is necessary if one wants to better model the neutrino signals and matter outflows from neutron star merger remnants via numerical simulations.

Observational advances have allowed the detection of galaxies, protoclusters, and galaxy clusters at higher and higher redshifts, opening a new view into extreme galaxy evolution. I present an argument that the high-redshift, massive galaxies discovered over the last decade are really the most massive galaxies within protocluster cores of galaxy clusters at z ∼ 2, and that they are the partial descendants of same galaxies discovered by JWST at z ∼ 9. To that end, I present The Manhattan Suite, a set of 100 high resolution zoom-in simulations of the most massive galaxy clusters, out to 9 Rvir, selected at z = 2 from a (1.5 cGpc)3 parent volume, and simulated using the simba model. Unlike other cluster suites, my selection at z = 2 ensures that these systems are biased in a similar fashion to observations, in that they should be the brightest and the most massive by construction at z ≳ 2. I show that my sample is able to reproduce extremely star-bursting protoclusters such as SPT2349-56, high-redshift galaxy clusters XLSSC122 and JKCS041, and the wealth of massive (sometimes quenched) galaxies at z ≳ 3 and up to z ∼ 9. I argue that these systems are intimately linked, and represent the same evolutionary history.

总结:
Mg ii h和k共振线极化是散射过程和磁场诱导的Hanle、Zeeman和磁光效应的共同作用结果，对太阳色球磁场的诊断具有重要潜力。2019年进行的Chromospheric LAyer Spectro-Polarimeter sounding-rocket实验成功地测量了两个不同区域的Stokes参数随波长的变化。通过应用HanleRT Tenerife反演代码，可以根据Stokes参数剖面提供磁场矢量的估计。非磁性对称性破坏的原因对线偏振剖面有重要影响，而在静止区像素中，磁场强度在上色球层的估计值在1至20 G之间变化。 <div>
The polarization of the Mg ii h and k resonance lines is the result of the joint action of scattering processes and the magnetic field–induced Hanle, Zeeman, and magneto-optical effects, thus holding significant potential for the diagnostic of the magnetic field in the solar chromosphere. The Chromospheric LAyer Spectro-Polarimeter sounding-rocket experiment, carried out in 2019, successfully measured at each position along the 196″ spectrograph slit the wavelength variation of the four Stokes parameters in the spectral region of this doublet around 280 nm, both in an active-region plage and in a quiet region close to the limb. We consider some of these CLASP2 Stokes profiles and apply to them the recently developed HanleRT Tenerife Inversion Code, which assumes a one-dimensional model atmosphere for each spatial pixel under consideration (i.e., it neglects the effects of horizontal radiative transfer). We find that the nonmagnetic causes of symmetry breaking, due to the horizontal inhomogeneities and the gradients of the horizontal components of the macroscopic velocity in the solar atmosphere, have a significant impact on the linear polarization profiles. By introducing such nonmagnetic causes of symmetry breaking as parameters in our inversion code, we can successfully fit the Stokes profiles and provide an estimation of the magnetic field vector. For example, in the quiet region pixels, where no circular polarization signal is detected, we find that the magnetic field strength in the upper chromosphere varies between 1 and 20 G.

Stellar magnetic fields have a major impact on space weather around exoplanets orbiting low-mass stars. From an analysis of Zeeman-broadened Fe i lines measured in near-infrared SDSS/APOGEE spectra, mean magnetic fields are determined for a sample of 29 M dwarf stars that host closely orbiting small exoplanets. The calculations employed the radiative transfer code Synmast and MARCS stellar model atmospheres. The sample M dwarfs are found to have measurable mean magnetic fields ranging between ∼0.2 and ∼1.5 kG, falling in the unsaturated regime on the 〈B〉 versus Prot plane. The sample systems contain 43 exoplanets, which include 23 from Kepler, nine from K2, and nine from Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. We evaluated their equilibrium temperatures, insolation, and stellar habitable zones and found that only Kepler-186f and TOI-700d are inside the habitable zones of their stars. Using the derived values of 〈B〉 for the stars Kepler-186 and TOI-700 we evaluated the minimum planetary magnetic field that would be necessary to shield the exoplanets Kepler-186f and TOI-700d from their host star’s winds, considering reference magnetospheres with sizes equal to those of the present-day and young Earth, respectively. Assuming a ratio of 5% between large- to small-scale B-fields, and a young-Earth magnetosphere, Kepler-186f and TOI-700d would need minimum planetary magnetic fields of, respectively, 0.05 and 0.24 G. These values are considerably smaller than Earth’s magnetic field of 0.25 G ≲ B ≲ 0.65 G, which suggests that these two exoplanets might have magnetic fields sufficiently strong to protect their atmospheres and surfaces from stellar magnetic fields.

We investigate Lyman-alpha (Lyα) transmission spikes at 5.2 < z < 6.8 using synthetic quasar spectra from the “Cosmic Reionization on Computers” simulations. We focus on understanding the relationship between these spikes and the properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Disentangling the complex interplay between IGM physics and the influence of galaxies on the generation of these spikes presents a significant challenge. To address this, we employ Explainable Boosting machines, an interpretable machine learning algorithm, to quantify the relative impact of various IGM properties on the Lyα flux. Our findings reveal that gas density is the primary factor influencing absorption strength, followed by the intensity of background radiation and the temperature of the IGM. Ionizing radiation from local sources (i.e., galaxies) appears to have a minimal effect on Lyα flux. The simulations show that transmission spikes predominantly occur in regions of low gas density. Our results challenge recent observational studies suggesting the origin of these spikes in regions with enhanced radiation. We demonstrate that Lyα transmission spikes are largely a product of the large-scale structure, of which galaxies are biased tracers.

We present a suite of six high-resolution chemodynamical simulations of isolated galaxies, spanning observed disk-dominated environments on the star-forming main sequence, as well as quenched, bulge-dominated environments. We compare and contrast the physics driving star formation and stellar feedback among the galaxies, with a view to modeling these processes in cosmological simulations. We find that the mass loading of galactic outflows is coupled to the clustering of supernova explosions, which varies strongly with the rate of galactic rotation Ω = vcirc/R via the Toomre length, leading to smoother gas disks in the bulge-dominated galaxies. This sets an equation of state in the star-forming gas that also varies strongly with Ω, so that the bulge-dominated galaxies have higher midplane densities, lower velocity dispersions, and higher molecular gas fractions than their main-sequence counterparts. The star formation rate in five out of six galaxies is independent of Ω and is consistent with regulation by the midplane gas pressure alone. In the sixth galaxy, which has the most centrally concentrated bulge and thus the highest Ω, we reproduce dynamical suppression of the star formation efficiency in agreement with observations. This produces a transition away from pressure-regulated star formation.

<div> 关键词: 太阳风，等熵不变量，拓展盒模型，磁场，等离子体动力学
总结: 
太阳风扩张动力学是空间物理中的一个基本问题，与等离子体反应紧密相关。文章通过拓展盒模型重新审视了Chew-Goldberger-Low（CGL）理论，主要目的是分离扩张效应，探讨等熵不变量的保守性。研究发现，如果通过拓展盒模型引入等离子体冷却效应，双绝热方程将不再保守，其演化与CGL理论以及实验观测存在偏差。这一偏差归因于等离子体扩张引起的冷却效应，同时表明加热机制在抵消等离子体冷却过程中起着重要作用。 <div>
One of the fundamental problems in space physics is the expansion dynamics of the solar wind, strongly correlated with collective plasma reactions, such as wave instabilities that tend to relax kinetic anisotropies. The expansion is in general described through the double adiabatic or Chew–Goldberger–Low (CGL) theory, which sets the main ideas and plasma expansion’s major role in describing plasma cooling/heating dynamics. Here, using the expanding box model (EBM) we revisit the CGL description including plasma expansion. Our primary objective is to isolate the expanding effects into the conservation of the double adiabatic invariants, a key aspect of the CGL theory. Following the same approximations and assumptions as in EBM and CGL theory, we developed a CGL-like description in which the expansion modifies the conservation of the double adiabatic invariants. Our results show that the double adiabatic equations are no longer conserved if plasma cooling is introduced through the EBM, with explicit dependence on expanding parameters, magnetic field profiles, and velocity gradients. Solving the equations for different magnetic field and density profiles (obtained self-consistently through the equations), we compute the evolution of temperature anisotropy and plasma beta, which deviates from CGL predictions and empirical observations. This deviation is attributed to the plasma cooling effect induced by the expansion of the plasma. The results suggest that heating mechanisms even play a major role in counteracting plasma cooling during expansion.

<div> JWST, supernovae, distance indicators, Hubble constant, TRGB<br />
总结:<br />
文章介绍了JWST在空间中使用6.5米镜面来提高超新星数量的测量精度。通过对Virgo星系团中NGC 4536的观测，展示了JWST计划GO-1995的目标是利用三种恒星距离指示器（Cepheids、TRGB和J-分支渐近巨星支/碳星）来测量Hubble常数。文章验证了可以从每种方法中获得精确到约0.05等级的距离测量。作者使用Hubble Space Telescope成像来识别TRGB星，并与JWST光度进行交叉匹配，并对TRGB的F115W与（F115W-F444W）关系进行了初步约束。利用新的TRGB斜率估计来平整2D TRGB特征，并相对于一组标准TRGB颜色测量了TRGB距离。文章最终证明了TRGB可以作为JWST可访问的红外波长下的标准化光源。 <div>
Boasting a 6.5 m mirror in space, JWST can increase by several times the number of supernovae (SNe) to which a redshift-independent distance has been measured with a precision distance indicator (e.g., tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) or Cepheids); the limited number of such SN calibrators currently dominates the uncertainty budget in distance ladder Hubble constant (H0) experiments. JWST/NIRCAM imaging of the Virgo Cluster galaxy NGC 4536 is used here to preview JWST program GO-1995, which aims to measure H0 using three stellar distance indicators (Cepheids, TRGB, and J-branch asymptotic giant branch/carbon stars). Each population of distance indicator was here successfully detected—with sufficiently large number statistics, well-measured fluxes, and characteristic distributions consistent with ingoing expectations—so as to confirm that we can acquire distances from each method precise to about 0.05 mag (statistical uncertainty only). We leverage overlapping Hubble Space Telescope imaging to identify TRGB stars, crossmatch them with the JWST photometry, and present a preliminary constraint on the slope of the TRGB’s F115W versus (F115W – F444W) relation equal to −0.99 ± 0.16 mag mag−1. This slope is consistent with prior slope measurements in the similar Two Micron All-Sky Survey J band, as well as with predictions from the BaSTI isochrone suite. We use the new TRGB slope estimate to flatten the 2D TRGB feature and measure a (blinded) TRGB distance relative to a set of fiducial TRGB colors, intended to represent the absolute fiducial calibrations expected from geometric anchors such as NGC 4258 and the Magellanic Clouds. In doing so, we empirically demonstrate that the TRGB can be used as a standardizable candle at the IR wavelengths accessible with JWST.

<title>SDSS J0018-0939: A Clear Signature of Sub-Chandrasekhar Mass Type 1a Supernova</title>

<br /><br />
这篇文章讨论了非常金属贫的星星（VMP，[Fe/H] ≤ −2），它们在α元素（如镁、硅和钙）上的丰度比太阳丰度还要低，称为α较低的VMP星星。它们通常与核心坍缩超新星有关，但研究发现其中一颗星SDSS J0018-0939可能具有亚钱德拉塞卡质量的白矮星引发的Ia型超新星的特征，这表明亚钱德拉塞卡质量的白矮星引发的Ia型超新星可能是早期银河系中Ia型超新星的主要来源，有可能占到50%至75%的比例。 <div>
Very metal-poor (VMP) stars ([Fe/H] ≤ −2) that have subsolar values of [X/Fe] for α elements such as Mg, Si, and Ca, are referred to as α-poor VMP stars. They are quite rare among VMP stars and are thought to have formed from gas enriched predominantly by a single Type Ia supernova (SN 1a) in contrast to most VMP stars, which are α-enhanced and usually associated with core-collapse supernovae. The observed abundance pattern in such stars can provide a direct way to probe the nucleosynthesis in individual SN 1a. Although the abundance patterns in some α-poor VMP stars have been shown to be consistent with SN 1a ejecta, a clear nucleosynthetic signature for SN 1a resulting from the explosion of a near Chandrasekhar mass (near-MCh) or a sub-Chandrasekhar mass (sub-MCh) white dwarf, has not been unambiguously detected. We perform a detailed analysis of various formation channels of VMP stars and find that the α-poor VMP star SDSS J0018-0939, which was earlier reported as a star with potential pair-instability supernova origin, provides a near-smoking-gun signature of a sub-MCh SN 1a resulting from He detonation. We find that compared to other α-poor VMP stars that were previously identified with SN 1a, SDSS J0018-0939 is the only star that has a clear and unambiguous signature of SN 1a. Interestingly, our results are consistent with constraints on SN1 a from recent galactic chemical evolution studies that indicate that sub-MCh SN 1a accounts for ∼50%–75% of all SN 1a and is possibly the dominant channel in the early Galaxy.

总结: <br />
本研究利用高分辨率三维全球磁流体力学模拟，研究了Ganymede磁层的Alfvén波空间分布，并基于Juno的飞越测量绘制了Ganymede电离层表面的Alfvén波椭圆。研究结果显示，模拟的Alfvén波椭圆与观察到的极光椭圆非常相似，但模拟得到的Alfvén波Poynting流量明显低于基于极光辐射度估算出的数值。此外，研究还发现，OCFB与Alfvén波功率增强的极地（赤道）边界紧密对齐，磁层通量管输运模式可以引导Alfvén波包向OCFB下游/上游侧的赤道或极地纬度传播。这些研究结果为Juno任务和未来的JUICE任务提供了可检验的预测。 <div>
Alfvén waves generated by the interactions between the Ganymede magnetosphere and the fast-corotating Jovian plasma carry a significant amount of energy. This energy is partially transferred to precipitating particles, which correspond to a feature called the Alfvénic oval. However, the spatial distribution of the Alfvénic oval in the Ganymede system is unclear, and the physical correlation between the Alfvénic oval and the open–closed field line boundary (OCFB) has not been studied quantitatively. Using a high-resolution, three-dimensional global magnetohydrodynamics simulation of Ganymede's magnetosphere, we investigate the spatial distribution of the Alfvénic oval mapped on the ionosphere surface of Ganymede based on upstream measurements from Juno's PJ34 flyby. Our results show that (1) the simulated Alfvénic oval of Ganymede closely resembles the observed aurora oval, and although without kinetic physics, the magnitude of the simulated Afvénic Poynting flux is significantly lower than the estimation based on auroral luminosity; (2) the OCFB aligns closely with the poleward (equatorial) boundary of the enhanced Alfvénic power on the downstream (upstream) side; and (3) the magnetospheric flux tube convection pattern can guide the Alfvénic wave packet to propagate toward latitudes either equatorward or poleward of the OCFB on the downstream/upstream side. These results, presented for the first time in this study, provide testable predictions for both the ongoing Juno mission and future Jovian missions such as JUICE probing the minimagnetosphere system.

During geomagnetic storms, which are the primary periods for heavy ions from the solar wind to enter Earth’s magnetospheric space, the charge state of solar wind heavy ions during these storms has significant implications for studying the distribution and effects of heavy ions in the magnetosphere. We analyzed the states and variations of heavy ions during 158 interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME)–driven geomagnetic storm events using data from the Advanced Composition Explorer satellite and examined four of these events in detail. We found that the increase in the average charge state of heavy ions such as O, Mg, Si, and Fe is positively correlated with the intensity of the geomagnetic storm. Regarding the abundance ratio of heavy ions such as Ne, Mg, Si, and Fe relative to oxygen ions, the rate and magnitude of increase in abundance ratios during extreme geomagnetic storms (Kp = 9) triggered by ICME events are significantly higher than those during other levels of geomagnetic storms. Additionally, we observed that although the average charge states of heavy ions such as O and Fe are correlated with the geomagnetic storm intensity induced by ICMEs, there are significant individual differences in the charge state variations of heavy ions.

总结:本研究使用Illustris TNG100模拟，量化了孤立低质量和高质量主要星系对的并合时间尺度随宇宙时间变化的情况，并探讨了不同选择标准对并合时间尺度的质量和红移依赖性的影响。作者提出了一种基于物理原理的框架，通过缩放分离标准来选择星系对，结果发现在所有红移下，应用这种缩放分离标准可以得到等效的低质量和高质量星系对的并合时间尺度。另外，对所有星系对应用静态物理分离选择标准会导致低质量星系对和高质量星系对的并合率差异高达约1亿年，尤其是在rsep < 150 kpc的情况下。因此，对物理分离选择的星系对应用相同的并合时间尺度会导致一种偏差，系统性地高估低质量星系的并合率。 <div>
The merger timescales of isolated low-mass pairs (108 < M* < 5 × 109M⊙) on cosmologically motivated orbits have not yet been studied in detail, though isolated high-mass pairs (5 × 109 < M* < 1011M⊙) have been studied extensively. It is common to apply the same separation criteria and expected merger timescales of high-mass pairs to low-mass systems, however, it is unclear if their merger timescales are similar, or if they evolve similarly with redshift. We use the Illustris TNG100 simulation to quantify the merger timescales of isolated low-mass and high-mass major pairs as a function of cosmic time, and explore how different selection criteria impact the mass and redshift dependence of merger timescales. In particular, we present a physically motivated framework for selecting pairs via a scaled separation criterion, wherein pair separations are scaled by the virial radius of the primary’s Friends-of-Friends (FoF) group halo (rsep < 1 Rvir). Applying these scaled separation criteria yields equivalent merger timescales for both mass scales at all redshifts. Alternatively, static physical separation selections applied equivalently to all galaxy pairs at all redshifts lead to a difference in merger rate of up to ∼1 Gyr between low- and high-mass pairs, particularly for rsep < 150 kpc. As a result, applying the same merger timescales to physical-separation-selected pairs will lead to a bias that systematically overpredicts low-mass galaxy merger rates.

总结:
Faraday rotation是探测活动星系核喷流周围磁场和磁化等离子体的重要方法。本文利用ALMA在85.2至101.3 GHz范围内获得了M87喷流的Faraday rotation测量图像。研究发现M87核心的RM为(4.5 ± 0.4) × 104 rad m−2，线偏振分数为(0.88 ± 0.08)%。M87喷流的空间RM梯度范围广泛，从∼ −2 × 104 rad m−2到∼3 × 104 rad m−2。与先前的RM测量结果相比，表明核心的Faraday旋转可能起源于超大质量黑洞非常近的位置。喷流的RM梯度表明磁场呈螺旋状，并一直延续到千秒差距尺度。结合较低频率下的千秒差距尺度RM测量结果，发现RM与频率有关，可能的解释是，千秒差距尺度喷流呈喇叭形状，在末端磁场呈螺旋状并逐渐解开。<br /><br /> <div>
Faraday rotation is an important probe of the magnetic fields and magnetized plasma around active galactic nuclei jets. We present a Faraday rotation measure (RM) image of the M87 jet between 85.2 and 101.3 GHz with a resolution of ∼2″ with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We found that the RM of the M87 core is (4.5 ± 0.4) × 104 rad m−2 with a low linear polarization fraction of (0.88 ± 0.08)%. The spatial RM gradient in the M87 jet spans a wide range from ∼ −2 × 104 rad m−2 to ∼3 × 104 rad m−2 with a typical uncertainty of 0.3 × 104 rad m−2. A comparison with previous RM measurements of the core suggests that the Faraday rotation of the core may originate very close to the supermassive black hole. Both an internal origin and an external screen with a rapidly varying emitting source could be possible. As for the jet, the RM gradient indicates a helical configuration of the magnetic field that persists up to the kiloparsec scale. Combined with the kiloparsec-scale RM measurements at lower frequencies, we found that RM is frequency-dependent in the jet. One possible scenario to explain this dependence is that the kiloparsec-scale jet has a trumpet-like shape, and the jet coil unwinds near its end.

<div> quadruply lensed quasar, rectangular hyperbola, lensing galaxy, perpendicular offset, lens models

总结:
Witt提出了从四重成像的类星体构建矩形双曲线的方法，这种双曲线与镜片星系非常接近。通过对39个由相对孤立星系透镜的系统进行观测，发现观测到的镜头光中心与Witt的双曲线之间的中位垂直偏移为0.″013。Witt采用的透镜模型预测，透镜位于双曲线上，但其位置并未用于构建模型。中位偏移大约相当于爱因斯坦环半径的1%，表明镜片的光中心与透镜潜在中心非常接近。在拟合数据时，通过对Witt的双曲线的垂直距离（或者星系与势能之间的距离）设置严格的先验条件，可以将模型空间的维数减少一个。将透镜星系的最亮像素视为其中心，避免了使用平均光中心进行约束的缺点。 <div>
When a rectangular hyperbola is constructed from the image positions of a quadruply lensed quasar, as proposed by Witt, it passes very close to the lensing galaxy. The median measured perpendicular offset between the observed light center of the lens and Witt’s hyperbola is 0.″013 for a sample for 39 systems lensed by a relatively isolated galaxy. The family of lens models adopted by Witt predicts that the lens lies on the hyperbola, but its position is not used for its construction. The median offset corresponds to roughly 1% of the Einstein ring radius and suggests that the centers of the lensing potential are close to the light centers of the lens. By putting a restrictive prior on the perpendicular distance to Witt’s hyperbola (or on the distance between the galaxy and the potential), one reduces by one the dimensionality of a model space when fitting data. Taking the brightest pixel of a lensing galaxy as its center avoids a shortcoming of using the average light center for a constraint.

分子云形成是通过碰撞诱发磁重联机制实现的，碰撞的两个原子气云触发了磁重联并产生了一个巨大的20光年长的丝状结构。通过辐射传输建模表明，这个丝状结构中间部分含有5光年跨度的密集核心，其中一些核心正在活跃地形成恒星。同时，超音速湍流的存在表明磁重联能够自发产生湍流。最后，形成的螺旋磁场应该从大多数观测角度都呈现出两侧的场反转。这一过程与传统的由上至下的云层层次分析不同，而是通过磁场重新连接将冲击气体凝结并逐段输送到主轴构成丝状结构。 <div>
We have investigated the possibility of molecular cloud formation via the collision-induced magnetic reconnection (CMR) mechanism of the cold neutral medium (CNM). Two atomic gas clouds with conditions typical of the CNM were set to collide at the interface of reverse magnetic fields. The cloud–cloud collision triggered magnetic reconnection and produced a giant 20 pc filamentary structure that was not seen in the control models without CMR. The cloud, with rich fiber-like substructures, developed a fully molecular spine at 5 Myr. Radiative transfer modeling of dust emission at far-infrared wavelengths showed that the middle part of the filament contained dense cores over a span of 5 pc. Some of the cores were actively forming stars and typically exhibited both connecting fibers in dust emission and high-velocity gas in CO line emission, indicative of active accretion through streamers. Supersonic turbulence was present in and around the CMR filament due to inflowing gas moving at supersonic velocities in the collision midplane. The shocked gas was condensed and transported to the main filament piece by piece by reconnected fields, making the filament and star formation a bottom-up process. Instead of forming a gravitationally bounded cloud that then fragments hierarchically (top-down) and forms stars, the CMR process creates dense gas pieces and magnetically transports them to the central axis to constitute the filament. Since no turbulence is manually driven, our results suggest that CMR is capable of self-generating turbulence. Finally, the resulting helical field should show field reversal on both sides of the filament from most viewing angles.

总结:
研究了一维、时间相关的磁致运动盘风模型，应用于潮汐撕裂事件的背景下。通过磁流体力学方程，考虑了磁制动和湍流黏度，得到了满足垂直无界MHD流的风解。模拟结果表明，盘风随着初始高斯密度分布的质量损失和从风和吸积的质量演化。同时发现，在没有风的情况下，质量吸积速率与时间的幂律关系为t^-19/16，但当风存在时，吸积速率下降更快。磁制动也导致了质量吸积速率的加速下降，产生了X射线延迟闪耀现象。模型预测了UV明亮的潮汐撕裂事件在后期的光度曲线将会比t^-19/16更陡峭，这可能是磁致风的有力指标。 <div>
We present a time-dependent, one-dimensional, magnetically driven disk wind model based on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, in the context of tidal disruption events (TDEs). We assume that the disk is geometrically thin, is gas pressure dominated, and explicitly accounts for magnetic braking and turbulent viscosity through an extended α-viscosity prescription. We find a particular wind solution for a set of basic equations that satisfies the necessary and sufficient conditions for vertically unbound MHD flows. The solution shows that the disk evolves with mass loss due to wind and accretion from the initial Gaussian density distribution. We confirm that the mass accretion rate follows the power law of time t−19/16 at late times in the absence of wind, which matches the classical solution of J. K. Cannizzo et al. We find that the mass accretion rate is steeper than the t−19/16 curve when the wind is present. Mass accretion is also induced by magnetic braking, known as the wind-driven accretion mechanism, which results in a faster decay with time of both the mass accretion and mass-loss rates. In the disk emission, the ultraviolet (UV) luminosity is the highest among the optical, UV, and X-ray luminosities. While the optical and X-ray emission is observationally insignificant without magnetic braking, the X-ray emission is brighter at late times, especially in the presence of magnetic braking. This provides a possible explanation for observed delayed X-ray flares. Our model predicts that late-time bolometric light curves steeper than t−19/16 in UV-bright TDEs are potentially compelling indicators of magnetically driven winds.

<div> NGC 1851, LMG, BHs, MSP, Monte Carlo N-body code
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了质量在2-5 M⊙之间的紧凑恒星遗迹的存在。通过NGC 1851星团的模拟，研究了LMG黑洞的形成过程，发现质量巨星演化和动力学相互作用都会对LMG黑洞的形成起到贡献。NGC 1851模型能够复制观测到的MSP-LMG BH双星系统，LMG黑洞还可能成为动力学形成的双星系统的组成部分，并且一些将会在类似于最近发现的引力波源GW230529的BH-NS系统中合并。然而，对应的合并率可能不超过1 Gpc-3 yr-1。 <div>
The existence of compact stellar remnants in the mass range 2–5 M⊙ has long been debated. This so-called lower-mass gap (LMG) was initially suggested by the lack of low-mass X-ray binary observations with accretors about 2–5 M⊙, but it has recently been called into question following newer observations, including an LMG candidate with a millisecond pulsar (MSP) companion in the dense globular cluster NGC 1851. Here, we model NGC 1851 with a grid of similar dense star clusters utilizing the state-of-the-art Monte Carlo N-body code Cluster Monte Carlo, and we specifically study the formation of LMG black holes (BHs). We demonstrate that both massive star evolution and dynamical interactions can contribute to forming LMG BHs. In general, the collapse of massive remnants formed through mergers of neutron stars (NSs) or massive white dwarfs produces the largest number of LMG BHs among all formation channels. However, in more massive clusters, supernova core collapse can contribute comparable numbers. Our NGC 1851-like models can reproduce MSP—LMG BH binaries similar to the observed system. Additionally, the LMG BHs can also become components of dynamically assembled binaries, and some will be in merging BH–NS systems similar to the recently detected gravitational wave source GW230529. However, the corresponding merger rate is probably ≲1 Gpc−3 yr−1.

JWST探测、碳载分子、宜居带次海王星、气态矮星、岩浆海洋

总结: 该文介绍了最近JWST探测到宜居带次海王星中含碳分子的发现，标志着低质量外星行星研究迎来新时代。次海王星群体的内部和大气构成多样，包括迷你海王星、超级地球和水世界。研究表明气态矮星可能具有岩质内部和厚厚的H2大气，与潜在的岩浆海洋相互作用可能导致可观测的大气特征。作者提出了一种内外大气耦合模型框架，用于研究气态矮星上岩浆海洋的可能性和可观测特征。研究发现表面-大气相互作用和大气成分对多种参数敏感，需要综合建模方法来避免不切实际的模型解。通过对宜居带次海王星K2-18 b进行案例研究，得出其观测大气成分与岩浆海洋场景不符，并确定了CO2、CO、NH3等大气分子和元素的关键诊断。研究还强调了准确建模这类外星行星所需的基本物质属性。 <div>
The recent JWST detections of carbon-bearing molecules in a habitable-zone sub-Neptune have opened a new era in the study of low-mass exoplanets. The sub-Neptune regime spans a wide diversity of planetary interiors and atmospheres not witnessed in the solar system, including mini-Neptunes, super-Earths, and water worlds. Recent works have investigated the possibility of gas dwarfs, with rocky interiors and thick H2-rich atmospheres, to explain aspects of the sub-Neptune population, including the radius valley. Interactions between the H2-rich envelope and a potential magma ocean may lead to observable atmospheric signatures. We report a coupled interior-atmosphere modeling framework for gas dwarfs to investigate the plausibility of magma oceans on such planets and their observable diagnostics. We find that the surface–atmosphere interactions and atmospheric composition are sensitive to a wide range of parameters, including the atmospheric and internal structure, mineral composition, volatile solubility and atmospheric chemistry. While magma oceans are typically associated with high-temperature rocky planets, we assess if such conditions may be admissible and observable for temperate sub-Neptunes. We find that a holistic modeling approach is required for this purpose and to avoid unphysical model solutions. Using our model framework, we consider the habitable-zone sub-Neptune K2-18 b as a case study and find that its observed atmospheric composition is incompatible with a magma ocean scenario. We identify key atmospheric molecular and elemental diagnostics, including the abundances of CO2, CO, NH3, and, potentially, S-bearing species. Our study also underscores the need for fundamental material properties for accurate modeling of such planets.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了卫星星系在银河系周围形成薄平面的物理机制。通过使用天体力学模拟，他们确认了大型卫星星系，如大麦哲伦星系，引起外部星系暗物质晕的视觉运动。他们发现所有卫星星系都引起了轨道极点分布的变化，但是质量最大且近日点在30至100kpc之间的卫星星系引起最大变化。最佳的大麦哲伦星系模拟显示了最大的轨道极点分布变化。这些结果表明，在银河系中，大麦哲伦星系的近日点经过应该已经改变了所有其他卫星星系的观测到的轨道极点分布。因此，在寻求将银河系置于宇宙背景下的卫星星系运动的研究中，应考虑到存在大麦哲伦星系这样的大型卫星星系。 <div>
Understanding the physical mechanism behind the formation of a corotating thin plane of satellite galaxies, like the one observed around the Milky Way (MW), has been challenging. The perturbations induced by a massive satellite galaxy, like the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), provide valuable insight into this problem. The LMC induces an apparent corotating motion in the outer halo by displacing the inner regions of the halo with respect to the outer halo. Using the Latte suite of Feedback In Realistic Environments cosmological simulations of MW-mass galaxies, we confirm that the apparent motion of the outer halo induced by the infall of a massive satellite changes the observed distribution of orbital poles of outer-halo tracers, including satellites. We quantify the changes in the distribution of orbital poles using the two-point angular correlation function and find that all satellites induce changes. However, the most massive satellites with pericentric passages between ≈30 and 100 kpc induce the largest changes. The best LMC-like satellite analog shows the largest change in orbital pole distribution. The dispersion of orbital poles decreases by 20° during the first two pericentric passages. Even when excluding the satellites brought in with the LMC-like satellite, there is clustering of orbital poles. These results suggest that in the MW, the recent pericentric passage of the LMC should have changed the observed distribution of orbital poles of all other satellites. Therefore, studies of kinematically coherent planes of satellites that seek to place the MW in a cosmological context should account for the existence of a massive satellite like the LMC.

Cep-Her复杂星团是在500光年范围内最大的星群之一，由Roslund 6、Orpheus、Cinyras和Cupavo等四个组成。其中，Orpheus、Cinyras和Cupavo是年龄在25-80百万年之间的年轻组织，分别包含9552颗±960颗、3872颗±455颗和8794颗±1827颗恒星。研究发现Cinyras组织可能经历了顺序的星形成过程，而Orpheus组织显示出可能存在多个云团形成的证据。另外，动力学模拟表明，尽管一些嵌入式的开放星团和这些组织的中心部分正在趋于聚集，它们可能缺乏足够的质量来吸引彼此并进行分层的簇组装。这些研究结果为将来的星球形成研究提供了复杂星形成环境的新视角。 <br /><br />总结: <br /> Cep-Her Complex 是由四个不同组织构成的复杂星团，包括了年龄较大的Roslund 6以及年轻的Orpheus、Cinyras和Cupavo。这些年轻组织都是体积庞大的星团，在其动力学和年龄上都展现出不同的特点。研究还指出Cinyras组织可能经历了顺序的星形成过程，而Orpheus组织显示出可能存在多个云团形成的证据。同时，动力学模拟结果表明这些组织可能不具备进行分层聚集的质量，这为未来的星球形成研究提供了重要的参考。 <div>
Young associations record complete histories of star-forming events through their demographics and dynamics, and Gaia has greatly expanded our knowledge of these associations. We present the first structural and dynamical overview study of the Cep-Her Complex, which has recently emerged as the largest stellar population within 500 pc that still lacks substantial follow-up. We reveal that Cep-Her is not a singular association, but rather an amalgam of four, consisting of the older (τ > 100 Myr) open cluster Roslund 6, in addition to three dynamically coherent and highly substructured young associations that we focus on: Orpheus (25–40 Myr), Cinyras (28–43 Myr), and Cupavo (54–80 Myr). With 9552 ± 960 stars in Orpheus, 3872 ± 455 stars in Cinyras, and 8794 ± 1827 stars in Cupavo, all three are among the largest young associations within 500 pc, rivalling major associations like Sco-Cen. Our novel view of the ages and dynamics of these associations reveals evidence for sequential star formation in Cinyras, in addition to a multiorigin pattern of stellar dispersal in Orpheus that may hint to the presence of multiple clouds at formation. Dynamical simulations indicate that, while some embedded open clusters and central components of these associations are converging, they likely lack the mass necessary to capture one another and undergo hierarchical cluster assembly. Our results provide our first view of the complex star-forming environments that gave rise to the associations of Cep-Her, which will serve as important laboratories for future studies of star and planet formation.

总结:
Hinode-SOT/SP和光谱线反演技术观察到了太阳光球中的颗粒逐渐消失的过程，并且在MURaM模拟中复现了这一现象。研究发现，小尺度的湍流运动在颗粒消失过程中被激发，并且这种湍流流动导致了光谱线的宽ening。因此，光谱线宽度可以成为太阳光球湍流流动的潜在追踪器。 <div>
In the quiet region of the solar photosphere, turbulent convective motions of the granular flows naturally drive the subgranular-scale flows. However, evaluating such small-scale velocities is challenging because of the limited instrumental resolution. Our previous study, R. T. Ishikawa et al., found line-broadening events during the fading process of granules; however, their physical mechanism has remained unclear. In the present study, we observed the fading granules with the Hinode-SOT/SP and performed spectral line inversions. Moreover, we investigated the broadening events of synthesized spectra in fading granules reproduced by the MURaM simulation. Our results demonstrated that the small-scale turbulent motions are excited in the fading process, and such turbulent flows contribute to line broadening. The spectral line widths can be potential tracers of the photospheric turbulent flows.

We present high-resolution simulations of high velocity clouds (HVCs) colliding with the outer part of the Galactic disk. All of the simulations include a 3 × 108M⊙ dark matter subhalo. Three simulations model a dark matter subhalo without a gaseous component, while eight simulations model a dark matter subhalo accompanied by a gaseous cloud of mass 2–8 × 106M⊙. Half of the simulations include the coherent component of the Galaxy's magnetic field. Each simulation spans ∼40 million years before the collision and ∼40 million years after the collision. The collisions between the gas cloud and disk splash gas into the halo, punch half-kiloparsec-size holes in the disk, and form long-lived, multi-kiloparsec-size shells. Each shell encloses a bubble of relatively cool gas. Holes and shells of these scales would be observable, and some have been observed in the past. We determine the fate of the HVC gas, temperature, composition, and ionization state of the bubble and shell gas, size and longevity of the holes, and effects of cloud density. Simulations show that the clouds do not survive the chaos of passage through the disk, but instead become part of the splash, bubble, and shell. Some dark matter clouds may appear to carry material with them long after the collision, but this material is shell gas that was captured by the dark matter subhalo. These results have ramifications for the Smith Cloud and other clouds hypothesized to have hit the Galactic disk.

总结:
本研究使用Persistent Homology构建了一个稳健的基于拓扑结构的空洞查找算法，应用于SDSS I/II Main Galaxy目录中绝对星等明亮于Mr = −20.19的星系的体积限定子样本和Horizon Run 4宇宙N体模拟构建的一组模拟目录。在红移范围0.02 ≤ z ≤ 0.116内，在SDSS数据中发现了32个拓扑稳健的空洞，有效半径在21-56 h−1 Mpc的范围内。空洞的中位邻近邻居距离约为∼57 h−1 Mpc，而中位径向空洞轮廓与模拟数据中的预期形状一致。 <div>
The structure of the low redshift Universe is dominated by a multiscale void distribution delineated by filaments and walls of galaxies. The characteristics of voids, such as morphology, average density profile, and correlation function, can be used as cosmological probes. However, their physical properties are difficult to infer due to shot noise and the general lack of tracer particles used to define them. In this work, we construct a robust, topology-based void-finding algorithm that utilizes Persistent Homology to detect persistent features in the data. We apply this approach to a volume-limited subsample of galaxies in the SDSS I/II Main Galaxy catalog with the r-band absolute magnitude brighter than Mr = −20.19, and a set of mock catalogs constructed using the Horizon Run 4 cosmological N-body simulation. We measure the size distribution of voids, their averaged radial profile, sphericity, and the centroid nearest neighbor separation, using conservative values for the threshold and persistence. We find 32 topologically robust voids in the SDSS data over the redshift range 0.02 ≤ z ≤ 0.116, with effective radii in the range 21−56 h−1 Mpc. The median nearest neighbor void separation is found to be ∼57 h−1 Mpc, and the median radial void profile is consistent with the expected shape from the mock data.

We report new theories and simulations for electron acceleration in magnetic islands generated by magnetic reconnection in the shock turbulence in a quasi-parallel shock, using a 2 and 1/2 dimensional particle-in-cell simulation. When an island is moving, unmagnetized electrons are accelerated by the Hall electric field pointing toward the island center. In a stationary island, some electrons are energized by “island betatron acceleration” due to the induction electric field when the island core magnetic field changes with time. In the simulation, almost all of the high-energy electrons in the shock transition region that show a power-law distribution are accelerated in ion-skin-depth-scale magnetic flux ropes, and about half of them are accelerated by the Hall electric field and island betatron acceleration. These mechanisms can produce a power-law electron distribution, and also inject electrons into the diffusive shock acceleration. The mechanisms are applicable to quasi-parallel shocks with high Alfvén Mach numbers (MA > 10), including planetary bow shocks and shocks in astrophysical objects such as supernova remnants.

EX Draconis is an eclipsing dwarf nova that shows outbursts with moderate amplitude (≃2 mag) and a recurrence timescale of ≃20–30 days. Dwarf novae outbursts are explained in terms of either a thermal-viscous instability in the disc or an instability in the mass-transfer rate of the donor star (MTIM). We developed simulations of the response of accretion discs to events of enhanced mass transfer, in the context of the MTIM, and applied them to model the light curve and variations in the radius of the EX Dra disc throughout the outburst. We obtain the first modeling of a dwarf nova outburst by using χ2 to select, from a grid of simulations, the best-fit parameters to the observed EX Dra outbursts. The observed time evolution of the system brightness and the changes in the radius of the outer disc along the outburst cycle are satisfactorily reproduced by a model of the response of an accretion disc with a viscosity parameter α = 4.0 and a quiescent mass-transfer rate g s−1 to an event of width Δt = 6.0 × 105 s (∼7 days) where the mass-transfer rate increases to g s−1.

总结:
本研究利用绿岭天文台的中性氢（H i）跟踪调查了378个光学探测到的超弱扩散星系（UDG）候选星系，其中110个目标检测到了H i。根据有效半径和中心表面亮度，我们确定了37个为UDGs，73个为低表面亮度(LSB)矮星系。与先前的研究一致，我们发现H i检测平均具有较蓝的g − r颜色和更不规则的形态，占据了ALFALFA星系表的星形主序的尾端，具有略低的特定星形成率。我们还发现H i检测主要在相对孤立（即，场）环境中，而大多数未检测到的在投影中至少有一个附近邻居。我们发现H i质量与恒星质量比（即，气体丰富度）与UDGs和LSB矮星系的物理尺寸成比例，这表明除了间歇性星形成反馈之外可能存在其他机制。然而，如果我们使用有效表面亮度而不是中心表面亮度来定义UDGs，则气体丰富度与物理尺寸之间存在更强的趋势。我们正在利用这个前所未有的UDG候选样本进行详细的后续研究（例如，星形成和环境分析，与模拟的比较），并且正在为其中的一些进行了解析的H i观测。 <div>
We present the results from the neutral hydrogen (H i) follow-up survey of 378 optically detected ultradiffuse galaxy (UDG) candidates from the Systematically Measuring Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies survey using the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope. We detect H i in 110 targets and determine 37 to be UDGs and 73 to be low-surface-brightness (LSB) dwarfs based on their effective radii and central surface brightnesses. In line with previous studies, we find that: (i) our H i detections have on average bluer g − r colors and more irregular morphologies than our H i nondetections, (ii) our H i detections populate the tail end of the star-forming main sequence from the ALFALFA catalog with marginally lower specific star formation rates, and (iii) H i detections are mostly in relatively isolated (i.e., field) environments, while most nondetections have at least one nearby neighbor in projection. We find that the H i mass to stellar mass ratios (i.e., gas richnesses) scale with the physical sizes for UDGs and LSB dwarfs alike, suggesting that mechanisms other than bursty star formation feedback may be at play for UDGs. However, we find a stronger trend between gas richnesses and physical sizes if we define UDGs using their effective surface brightness instead of their central surface brightness. We are in the process of using this unprecedented sample of UDG candidates to carry out detailed follow-up studies (i.e., star formation and environmental analysis, comparisons to simulations) and are obtaining resolved H i observations for several of them.

The rotational mass loss has been realized to be a prevalent mechanism to produce low-speed debris near the asteroid, and the size composition of the asteroid’s surface regolith has been closely measured by in situ explorations. However, the full-scale evolution of the shedding debris has not been examined using the observed particle sizes, which may hold vital clues to the initial growth of an asteroid moonlet and help us to understand the general mechanisms that dominate the formation of asteroid systems. This paper presents our study on the cumulative evolution of the debris cloud formed by a rotationally unstable asteroid. A semianalytical model is developed to characterize the spatiotemporal evolution of the debris cloud posterior to a shedding event. Large-scale discrete element method (DEM) simulations are performed to quantify the clustering behavior of the debris particles in the mechanical environment near the asteroid. As a result, we found that the cumulation of a steady debris cloud is dominated by large pieces of debris, and the shedding particles follow a common migration trend, which fundamentally determines the mass distribution of the debris cloud. For the accretion analysis, we sketched the life cycle of a debris cluster and showed its dependency on particle size. The DEM simulations adopt physical parameters estimated from observations and asteroid missions. The results confirm that porous fluffy cluster structures can form shortly after a shedding event with magnitudes the same as the observed shedding activities. Measurements of these structures show that they themselves possess a certain strength and have the capacity to collisions to absorb dissociative particles that collide with them.

Stars in an open cluster are assumed to have formed from a broadly homogeneous distribution of gas, implying that they should be chemically homogeneous. Quantifying the level to which open clusters are chemically homogeneous can therefore tell us about interstellar medium pollution and gas mixing in progenitor molecular clouds. Using Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-V Milky Way Mapper and SDSS-IV Apache Point Observatory Galaxy Evolution Experiment DR17 abundances, we test this assumption by quantifying intrinsic chemical scatter in up to 20 different chemical abundances across 26 Milky Way open clusters. We find that we can place 3σ upper limits on open cluster homogeneity within 0.02 dex or less in the majority of elements, while for neutron capture elements, as well as those elements having weak lines, we place limits on their homogeneity within 0.2 dex. Finally, we find that giant stars in open clusters are ∼0.01 dex more homogeneous than a matched sample of field stars.

Y1 is a merging system of three components, and the existing redshift z = 8.31 is confirmed. However, JD is at z = 8.34 instead of the previously claimed z = 9.28. JD’s close companion, “JD-N,” which was a previously discovered z > 8 candidate, is now identified at the same redshift as JD. JD and JD-N form an interacting pair. A new candidate at z > 8, “f090d_018,” is also confirmed and is at z = 8.49. These four objects are likely part of an overdensity that signposts a large structure extending ∼165 kpc in projected distance and ∼48.7 Mpc in radial distance. They are magnified by less than 1 mag and have an intrinsic MUV ranging from −19.57 to −20.83 mag. Their spectral energy distributions show that the galaxies are all very young with ages ∼ 4–18 Myr and stellar masses of about 107–8M⊙. These infant galaxies have very different star formation rates ranging from a few to over a hundred solar masses per year, but only two of them (JD and f090d_018) have blue rest-frame UV slopes β < −2.0 indicative of a high Lyman-continuum photon escape fraction that could contribute significantly to the cosmic hydrogen-reionizing background. Interestingly, these two galaxies are the least massive and least active ones among the four. The other two systems have much flatter UV slopes largely because of their high dust extinction (AV = 0.9–1.0 mag). Their much lower indicated escape fractions show that even very young, actively star-forming galaxies can have a negligible contribution to reionization when they quickly form dust throughout their bodies.

这篇文章报告了2022年11月9日至11月15日之间观测到的一系列太阳能电子（SEE）事件。在此期间，Solar Orbiter、STEREO-A和近地球的航天器观测到了至少32次能量大于10keV的SEE强度增强现象，其中13次发生在11月11日。这些事件中的一些伴随着小于10MeV的质子和小于2MeV的重离子强度增强。通过结合来自三个观测点的遥感和原位数据，研究人员确定了这一系列事件的起源是在两个活跃区附近的极端紫外观测中探测到的一系列明亮现象和喷射。研究人员还发现硬X射线耀斑、III型射电爆发与SEE的释放之间存在密切关联。另外，11月9日和14日观测到的两次特殊的SEE事件，主要是在电子能量小于50keV但富含小于1MeV的重离子，这些事件的起源是不明确的慢上升EUV排放。 <br /><br />总结: 这篇文章总结了2022年11月9日至11月15日期间观测到的一系列太阳能电子（SEE）事件。观测结果显示，这些事件与活跃区附近的极端紫外观测中探测到的一系列明亮现象和喷射有关，同时伴随着硬X射线耀斑和III型射电爆发。此外，也观测到了两次特殊的SEE事件，但其起源仍不明确。 <div>
A series of solar energetic electron (SEE) events was observed from 2022 November 9 to November 15 by Solar Orbiter, STEREO-A, and near-Earth spacecraft. At least 32 SEE intensity enhancements at energies >10 keV were clearly distinguishable in Solar Orbiter particle data, with 13 of them occurring on November 11. Several of these events were accompanied by ≲10 MeV proton and ≲2 MeV nucleon−1 heavy-ion intensity enhancements. By combining remote-sensing and in situ data from the three viewpoints (Solar Orbiter and STEREO-A were ∼20° and ∼15° east of Earth, respectively), we determine that the origin of this rapid succession of events was a series of brightenings and jetlike eruptions detected in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations from the vicinity of two active regions. We find a close association between these EUV phenomena, the occurrence of hard X-ray flares, type III radio bursts, and the release of SEEs. For the most intense events, usually associated with extended EUV jets, the distance between the site of these solar eruptions and the estimated magnetic connectivity regions of each spacecraft with the Sun did not prevent the arrival of electrons at the three locations. The capability of jets to drive coronal fronts does not necessarily imply the observation of an SEE event. Two peculiar SEE events on November 9 and 14, observed only at electron energies ≲50 keV but rich in ≲1 MeV nucleon−1 heavy ions, originated from slow-rising confined EUV emissions, for which the process resulting in energetic particle release to interplanetary space is unclear.

该研究使用星等测光数据和贝叶斯混合模型对BHBs进行分类，并发现它们在星等颜色空间中的独特位置。在对获得的高概率BHBs进行分析后，研究人员成功绘制了银河系晕的星体分布，并发现其数量密度符合幂律密度剖面。研究还考察了系统误差和空间不均匀性对密度剖面的影响。该工作证实了高精度星等测光数据在选择BHBs方面的有效性。未来的Rubin Observatory光度巡天将有望在10年的任务期间实现比DES更深2-3个等级的观测深度，从而进一步探索银河系晕的密度剖面，揭示我们银河系形成和演化的复杂过程。

Blue horizontal branch stars (BHBs), excellent distant tracers for probing the Milky Way’s halo density profile, are distinguished in the versus (i − z)0 color space from another class of stars, blue straggler stars. We develop a Bayesian mixture model to classify BHBs using high-precision photometry data from the Dark Energy Survey Data Release 2 (DES DR2). We select ∼2100 highly probable BHBs based on their griz photometry and the associated uncertainties, and we use these stars to map the stellar halo over the Galactocentric radial range 20 kpc ≲ R ≲ 70 kpc. After excluding known stellar overdensities, we find that the number density n⋆ of BHBs can be represented by a power-law density profile n⋆ ∝ R−α with an index of , consistent with existing literature values. In addition, we examine the impact of systematic errors and the spatial inhomogeneity on the fitted density profile. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of high-precision griz photometry in selecting BHBs. The upcoming photometric survey from the Rubin Observatory, expected to reach depths 2–3 mag greater than DES during its 10 yr mission, will enable us to investigate the density profile of the Milky Way’s halo out to the virial radius, unraveling the complex processes of formation and evolution in our Galaxy.

<br /><br />总结:
本文提出了一种从James Webb Space Telescope观测的引力透镜聚类图像中建立和去除聚类星系和星系团内光（ICL）的方法论。研究者们在SMACS 0723 Early Release Observations中应用这一方法，并利用去除了ICL的图像选择了一组星团和矮星系。他们比较了这两个样本的空间分布与他们所建立的星系和ICL光模型，发现了显著的相似之处。特别是，他们发现星团追踪着弥散的ICL，而矮星系集中在聚类中心附近。研究者们量化了紧凑源的表面密度与总聚类光之间的关系，并展示了显著的紧密相关性。他们重复了他们的方法，将星团的分布与暗物质表面密度进行了比较，得到了类似的结果。研究结果表明星团和弥散的ICL可能具有共同的起源，大质量星系与聚类合并时的剥离可能是一个合理的情景。 <div>
We present a methodology for modeling and removing light from cluster galaxies and intracluster light (ICL) from James Webb Space Telescope images of gravitational lensing clusters. We apply our method to Webb’s First Deep Field the SMACS 0723 Early Release Observations and use the ICL-subtracted images to select a sample of globular clusters (GCs) and dwarf galaxies within the cluster. We compare the spatial distributions of these two samples with our models of the galaxy and ICL light, finding significant similarities. In particular, we find that GCs trace the diffuse ICL, while dwarf galaxies are centrally concentrated near the cluster center We quantify the relationship between the surface density of compact sources and total cluster light, demonstrating a significant, tight correlation. We repeat our methodology and compare distributions of GCs with the dark matter surface density and find a comparable result. Our findings suggest a common origin for GCs and diffuse ICL, with stripping from massive galaxies as they merge with the cluster being a plausible scenario.

We report 10 fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected in the far sidelobe region (i.e., ≥5° off-meridian) of the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) from August 28 2018 to August 31 2021. We localize the bursts by fitting their spectra with a model of the CHIME/FRB synthesized beam response. We find that the far sidelobe events have on average ∼500 times greater fluxes than events detected in CHIME’s main lobe. We show that the sidelobe sample is therefore statistically ∼20 times closer than the main lobe sample. We find promising host galaxy candidates (Pcc < 1%) for two of the FRBs, 20190112B and 20210310B, at distances of 38 and 16 Mpc, respectively. CHIME/FRB did not observe repetition of similar brightness from the uniform sample of 10 sidelobe FRBs in a total exposure time of 35,580 hr. Under the assumption of Poisson-distributed bursts, we infer that the mean repetition interval above the detection threshold of the far sidelobe events is longer than 11,880 hr, which is at least 2380 times larger than the interval from known CHIME/FRB detected repeating sources, with some caveats, notably that very narrowband events could have been missed. Our results from these far sidelobe events suggest one of two scenarios: either (1) all FRBs repeat and the repetition intervals span a wide range, with high-rate repeaters being a rare sub-population, or (2) non-repeating FRBs are a distinct population different from known repeaters.

<div> Lyman limit system, O VI doublet lines, galaxies, gas phases, metallicity
总结:
这篇文章报告了对位于背景类星体FBQS J0209–0438的多相Lyman limit系统(LLS)的分析。文章发现，与这个吸收体相关的O VI双线与低电离金属和H i的谱线具有不同的轮廓。Ly α具有一个与O VI成分非常一致的非常宽的H i成分(b ≈ 150 km s−1)。宽H i和O VI的多普勒b参数表明这些气体的温度约为(0.8 − 2.0) × 10^6 K，并且氢柱密度是负责LLS的冷相气体的一个数量级大。Very Large Telescope MUSE的观测显示，在吸收体附近的约105千秒差距内存在两个中等星形成率的星系，其中一个是一个侏儒星系(M* ≈ 10^6M⊙)，与类星体点扩散函数重叠，另一个是一个较大的星系(R1/2 ≈ 4 kpc) ，具有M* ≈ 3 × 10^10M⊙和Mh ≈ 7 × 10^11M⊙，并且侏儒星系位于其温度半径内。尽管吸收与较大星系的扩展主轴对齐，但吸收气体的视向速度与共转吸积不一致。LLS的金属丰度低于两个星系的气态[O/H]。吸收气体中涉及冷和温/热的气体相，并且它在星系对的联合暗物质环境中的接近和取向，表明LLS是两个星系的联合暗物质环境中的高速气体。 <div>
We report on the analysis of a multiphase Lyman limit system (LLS) at z = 0.39047 identified toward the background quasar FBQS J0209–0438. The O VI doublet lines associated with this absorber have a different profile from the low-ionization metals and H i. Ly α has a very broad H i (b ≈ 150 km s−1) component well-aligned with one of the O VI components. The Doppler b-parameters for the broad H i and O VI indicate gas with T = (0.8 − 2.0) × 106 K and a total hydrogen column density that is an order of magnitude larger than the cooler phase of gas responsible for the LLS. Observations by the Very Large Telescope MUSE show two moderately star-forming galaxies within ρ ≲ 105 kpc and ∣Δv∣ ≲ 130 km s−1 of the absorber, one of them a dwarf galaxy (M* ≈ 106M⊙) overlapping with the quasar point-spread function, and the other a larger galaxy (R1/2 ≈ 4 kpc) with M* ≈ 3 × 1010M⊙ and Mh ≈ 7 × 1011M⊙, and the dwarf galaxy within its virial radius. Although the absorption is aligned with the extended major axis of the larger galaxy, the line-of-sight velocity of the absorbing gas is inconsistent with corotating accretion. The metallicity inferred for the LLS is lower than the gas phase [O/H] of the two galaxies. The mixture of cool and warm/hot gas phases for the absorbing gas and its proximity and orientation to the galaxy pair points to the LLS being a high-velocity gas in the combined halo environment of both galaxies.

Stable isotopic ratios constitute powerful tools for unraveling the thermal and irradiation history of volatiles. In particular, we can use our knowledge of the isotopic fractionation processes active during the various stages of star, disk, and planet formation to infer the origins of different volatiles with measured isotopic patterns in our own solar system. Observations of planet-forming disks with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) now readily detect the heavier isotopologues of C, O, and N, while the isotopologue abundances and isotopic fractionation mechanisms of sulfur species are less well understood. Using ALMA observations of the SO and SO2 isotopologues in the nearby, molecule-rich disk around the young star Oph-IRS 48 we present the first constraints on the combined 32S/34S and 32S/33S isotope ratios in a planet-forming disk. Given that these isotopologues likely originate in relatively warm gas (>50 K), like most other Oph-IRS 48 volatiles, SO is depleted in heavy sulfur, while SO2 is enriched compared to solar system values. However, we cannot completely rule out a cooler gas reservoir, which would put the SO sulfur ratios more in line with comets and other solar system bodies. We also constrain the S18O/SO ratio and find the limit to be consistent with solar system values given a temperature of 60 K. Together these observations show that we should not assume solar isotopic values for disk sulfur reservoirs, but additional observations are needed to determine the chemical origin of the abundant SO in this disk, inform on what isotopic fractionation mechanism(s) are at play, and aid in unraveling the history of the sulfur budget during the different stages of planet formation.

<div> AstroSat, NGC 4151, multiwavelength spectral study, X-ray absorption, intrinsic reddening<br />
<br />总结:<br />本文通过对NGC 4151进行的五次AstroSat观测，对其多波段光谱进行了研究。通过对内部和银河消光、广线区和窄线区的贡献以及宿主星系的发射进行校正，得出了固有的吸积盘连续谱。研究发现，在更亮的紫外光通量下，连续谱较蓝，可能是由于吸积盘连续谱或紫外线红移的变化。利用2000年3月获得的高分辨率哈勃空间望远镜（HST）/ STIS光谱，估计出固有红化为E（B − V）∼0.4。利用热康普顿散射、中性和电离吸收以及X射线反射来模拟X射线光谱。发现X射线吸收的中性柱变化在NH∼1.2和3.4×1023 cm−2之间，比通过假设银河尘埃与气体比值估算的UV消光大约100倍。为了解释这一差异，提出了两种可能的模型：（a）由不含尘域和含尘域组成的双区域遮挡器，通过升华半径分隔；或（b）由密集云团嵌入低密度介质的双相遮挡器，使得少数密集云团大幅度地遮挡致密的X射线光源，而大部分紫外发射来自于通过低密度介质的扩展吸积盘。此外，发现X射线吸收柱与NUV−远紫外颜色和紫外光通量呈正相关，表明可能受到由"更亮时更蓝"紫外连续谱驱动的增强风的影响。 <div>
We present a multiwavelength spectral study of NGC 4151 based on five epochs of simultaneous AstroSat observations in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) to hard X-ray band (∼0.005–80 keV) during 2017–2018. We derived the intrinsic accretion disk continuum after correcting for internal and Galactic extinction, contributions from broad- and narrow-line regions, and emission from the host galaxy. We found a bluer continuum at brighter UV flux, possibly due to variations in the accretion disk continuum or the UV reddening. We estimated the intrinsic reddening, E(B − V) ∼ 0.4, using high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/STIS spectrum acquired in 2000 March. We used thermal Comptonization, neutral and ionized absorption, and X-ray reflection to model the X-ray spectra. We obtained the X-ray absorbing neutral column varying between NH ∼1.2 and 3.4 × 1023 cm−2, which are ∼100 times larger than that estimated from UV extinction, assuming the Galactic dust-to-gas ratio. To reconcile this discrepancy, we propose two plausible configurations of the obscurer: (a) a two-zone obscurer consisting of dust-free and dusty regions, divided by the sublimation radius, or (b) a two-phase obscurer consisting of clumpy, dense clouds embedded in a low-density medium, resulting in a scenario where a few dense clouds obscure the compact X-ray source substantially, while the bulk of UV emission arising from the extended accretion disk passes through the low-density medium. Furthermore, we find a positive correlation between the X-ray absorption column and NUV − far-UV color and UV flux, indicative of enhanced winds possibly driven by the “bluer-when-brighter” UV continuum.

The accretion of material from disks onto weakly magnetized objects invariably involves its traversal through a material surface, known as the boundary layer (BL). Our prior studies have revealed two distinct global wave modes for circumplanetary disks with BLs exhibiting opposite behaviors in spin modulation. We perform a detailed analysis of the effects of magnetic fields on these global modes, highlighting how magnetic resonances and turning points could complicate the wave dynamics. The angular momentum flux becomes positive near the BL with increasing magnetic field strength. We also examine the perturbation profile to demonstrate the amplification of magnetic fields within the BL. The dependence of growth rates on the magnetic field strength and the spin rate are systematically investigated. We find that stronger magnetic fields tend to result in lower terminal spin rates. We stress the potential possibility of the formation of angular momentum belts and pressure bumps. The implications for the spin evolution and quasiperiodic oscillations observed in compact objects are also briefly discussed. Our calculations advance the understanding of magnetohydrodynamical accretion processes and lay a foundation for observational studies and numerical simulations.

这篇文章介绍了来自Dark Energy Survey超新星项目的光度分类SNe Ia的完整哈勃图。该项目发现了超过20,000个超新星候选，并获得了7000个宿主星系的光谱红移。在光度曲线质量的基础上，选择了1635个光度识别的SNe Ia，其光谱红移为0.10 < z < 1.13，这是任何单个调查中已知的z > 0.5超新星数量增加了5倍。在另一篇论文中，提出了DES-SN样本的宇宙学结果，结合了低红移处的194个光谱分类的SNe Ia作为宇宙学拟合的锚定点。在本文中，我们对这个联合样本进行了广泛的建模，并验证了用于推导距离的整个分析流程。我们展示了在平坦ΛCDM模型中宇宙学参数的统计和系统误差为0.017，在平坦wCDM模型中为= (0.082, 0.152)。将DES SN数据与Planck协作组的高度互补的宇宙微波背景测量相结合，能够将宇宙学参数的不确定性减小4倍。在所有情况下，统计不确定性都大于系统误差。我们还表明，由于光度分类引起的不确定性仅占总系统误差预算的不到10%。这一结果为Vera C.

We present the full Hubble diagram of photometrically classified Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Dark Energy Survey supernova program (DES-SN). DES-SN discovered more than 20,000 SN candidates and obtained spectroscopic redshifts of 7000 host galaxies. Based on the light-curve quality, we select 1635 photometrically identified SNe Ia with spectroscopic redshift 0.10 < z < 1.13, which is the largest sample of supernovae from any single survey and increases the number of known z > 0.5 supernovae by a factor of 5. In a companion paper, we present cosmological results of the DES-SN sample combined with 194 spectroscopically classified SNe Ia at low redshift as an anchor for cosmological fits. Here we present extensive modeling of this combined sample and validate the entire analysis pipeline used to derive distances. We show that the statistical and systematic uncertainties on cosmological parameters are 0.017 in a flat ΛCDM model, and = (0.082, 0.152) in a flat wCDM model. Combining the DES SN data with the highly complementary cosmic microwave background measurements by Planck Collaboration reduces by a factor of 4 uncertainties on cosmological parameters. In all cases, statistical uncertainties dominate over systematics. We show that uncertainties due to photometric classification make up less than 10% of the total systematic uncertainty budget. This result sets the stage for the next generation of SN cosmology surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time.

<div> 高红移、太空望远镜、星系、宇宙环境、暴星形成<br />
<br />总结:
本研究利用JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES)的观测数据，通过MIRI和NIRCam成像筛选出了高红移的静止星系和暴星形成星系。研究发现，利用MIRI 7.7um成像可以在3 < z < 6的范围内鉴定出23个UVJ颜色空间中的静止演化星系，以及12个低质量的暴星形成星系。这些星系的环境分析也表明，低质量的暴星形成星系更偏向于出现在高密度的环境中。具体而言，研究发现了位于z约3.7的一个过密区域，其中有7个低质量的暴星形成星系。此外，还发现了一个群集中心包含一颗质量巨大的静态星系和一颗有明显残余尘埃成分的星系，这表明星系的环境对其演化有重要影响。 <div>
We present the robust selection of high-redshift quiescent galaxies (QG) and poststarburst (PSB) galaxies using ultra-deep NIRCam and MIRI imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). At 3 < z < 6, MIRI 7.7 μm imaging provides rest-frame J band, which is commonly used to break the degeneracy between old stellar populations and dust attenuation at lower redshifts. We identify 23 passively evolving galaxies in UVJ color space in a mass-limited (log M⋆/M⊙ ≥ 8.5) sample over 8.8 arcmin2. An evaluation of the contribution of the 7.7 μm shows that JADES-like NIRCam coverage (9+ photometric bands) can compensate for lacking the J band at these redshifts; however, more limited three-band selections perform better with MIRI. Our sample is characterized by rapid quenching timescales (∼100–600 Myr) with formation redshifts zf ≲ 9 and includes a potential record-holding massive QG at and two QGs with evidence for significant residual dust content (AV ∼ 1–2). In addition, we present a large sample of 12 log M⋆/M⊙ = 8.5–9.5 PSBs, demonstrating that UVJ selection can be extended to low mass. An analysis of the environment of our sample reveals that the group known as the Cosmic Rose contains a massive QG and a dust-obscured star-forming galaxy (a so-called Jekyll and Hyde pair) plus three additional QGs within ∼20 kpc. Moreover, the Cosmic Rose is part of a larger overdensity at z ∼ 3.7, which contains 7/12 of our low-mass PSBs. Another four low-mass PSBs are members of an overdensity at z ∼ 3.4; this result strongly indicates low-mass PSBs are preferentially associated with overdense environments at z > 3.

总结:<br />
本文介绍了JWST上的中红外仪器MIRI以及其在天文调查中的重要性。MIRI的光谱能力得到了扩展，使得对调查结果的详细解释成为可能。SMILES的设计旨在充分利用MIRI的这一能力。文章对红外调查的历史进行了简要描述，并说明了观测结果在各种科学项目中的用途，最后强调了JWST/MIRI需要进行更多全波段调查的必要性。 <div>
The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) for JWST is supplied with a suite of imaging band-pass filters optimized for full spectral coverage in eight intermediate-width bands from 5 to 26 μm and a narrower one at 11.3 μm. This contrasts with previous infrared space telescopes, which generally have provided only two broad bands, one near 10 μm and the other near 20 μm. The expanded MIRI spectral capability provides new possibilities for detailed interpretation of survey results. This is an important feature of the instrument, on top of its great increase in sensitivity and angular resolution over any previous mission. The Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES) was designed to take full advantage of this capability. This paper briefly describes the history of infrared surveys that paved the way for MIRI on JWST and for our approach to designing SMILES. It illustrates the use of the observations for a broad range of science programs and concludes with a brief summary of the need for additional full multiband surveys with JWST/MIRI. This paper is an overall introduction to the survey and is accompanied by a full data release, described in detail by S. Alberts et al.

Ion acoustic waves are pervasive at the Earth’s bow shock and in regions of active plasmas. Recently, frequency-dispersed ion acoustic-like waves have been observed by Parker Solar Probe in the near-Sun solar wind. These waves are electrostatic, propagate nearly along the magnetic field, and have frequencies on the order of the ion plasma frequency. Frequency-dispersed emissions appear in short (<1 s) bursts and exhibit rising and/or falling tones. This article has a narrow focus, to determine if impulsively accelerated ions are a plausible generation mechanism. We show that velocity dispersion from impulsively accelerated ions can generate a positive slope in the ion distribution that changes in space and time, which can lead to emissions with rising or falling tones given a substantial Doppler shift from the solar wind. The phase velocity is at the velocity of the positive slope, which can differ from the ion acoustic speed, but otherwise these waves are similar to ion acoustic waves. Wave growth is strongest when the positive slope velocity is near the ion acoustic speed. Two mechanisms for impulsive ion acceleration are explored. One mechanism imparts equal energy into the source ions as expected from a parallel potential. The other mechanism imparts equal velocity into the source ions such as that expected from impulsive magnetic reconnection. Both mechanisms result in similar wave characteristics with only subtle differences. Given the persistent appearance of these ion acoustic-like waves, these results suggest that impulsively accelerated ions may be abundant in the near-Sun solar wind.

总结: 本文介绍了天体物理透镜效应的研究，重点在于波动光学效应对相干光源的重要性，并提出了“透镜点扩散函数”（LPSF）的概念，用以描述频率相关的光源通量密度分布。LPSF涵盖了从高频离散几何图像到低频平滑分布的变化过程，是有限频率下透镜图像概念的推广。同时，文章确定了具有非平凡波动效应的频率范围，并指出观测该效应需要非常接近的透镜或非常大的观测波长。最后，文章提到了潜在的观测可能性，包括引力波的透镜效应、银河脉冲星的等离子体透镜效应以及太阳引力透镜效应。 <br /><br /> <div>
Most research on astrophysical lensing has been conducted using the geometric optics framework, where there exists a clear concept of lensing images. However, wave optics effects can be important for coherent sources, e.g., pulsars, fast radio bursts, and gravitational waves observed at long wavelengths. There, the concept of lensing images needs an extension. We introduce the concept of the “lensing point-spread function” (LPSF), the smoothed flux density distribution of a coherent point source after being lensed, as a generalization of the lensing image concept at finite frequencies. The frequency-dependent LPSF captures the gradual change of the flux density distribution of the source from discrete geometric images at high frequencies to a smooth distribution at low frequencies. It complements other generalizations of lensing images, notably the imaginary images and the Lefschetz thimbles. Being a footprint of a lensing system, the LPSF is useful for theoretical studies of lensing. Using the LPSF, we identify a frequency range with nontrivial wave effects, where both geometric optics and perturbative wave optics fail, and determine this range to be ∣κ∣−1 ≲ ν ≲ 10, with κ and ν being the dimensionless lens amplitude and the reduced observing frequency, respectively. Observation of LPSFs with nontrivial wave effects requires either very close-by lenses or very large observing wavelengths. The potential possibilities are the lensing of gravitational waves, the plasma lensing of Milky Way pulsars, and lensing by the solar gravitational lens.

中红外水汽发射光谱为表征行星形成盘向内部(<5 au)递送冰冷卵石提供了一种新的方法。最近，JWST MIRI-MRS显示，紧凑盘相对于多重间隔盘具有低能水蒸气发射的过量，这表明在前者中冰冷卵石的漂移更为高效。我们进行了详细的发射线建模来获取JWST 碎片红外光谱化学调查中四个紧凑盘和三个多重间隔盘的旋转水蒸气发射的激发条件。我们呈现了两温度H2O平板模型的检索，并通过拟合参数化径向温度和柱密度分布首次限制水蒸气的空间分布。这些模型在统计上胜过了两温度平板拟合。我们发现可观测的热水蒸气质量与恒星质量吸积率之间存在相关性，以及冷水蒸气质量与亚毫米尘盘半径之间存在反相关性，证实了先前报告的水线通量趋势。我们发现，中红外光谱追踪的H2O的温度下降至180-300 K，但最冷的150-170 K气体仍然未被探测到。此外，H2O温度分布通常比被动辐射盘中预期的“过热”尘埃温度更加陡峭和凉爽。柱密度分布用于估算冰冷卵石质量通量，这表明如果局部进食机制主导它们的组装，紧凑盘和多重间隔盘可能产生明显不同的内盘系外行星种群。<br /><br />总结:文章研究了使用JWST MIRI-MRS对恒星周围行星形成盘的水蒸气发射光谱进行了分析，并针对紧凑盘和多重间隔盘进行了比较。结果显示紧凑盘的水蒸气发射量较高，且与恒星质量吸积率相关，而多重间隔盘的冷水蒸气质量与亚毫米尘盘半径呈反相关。文章还从H2O温度和柱密度分布方面对冰冷卵石质量通量进行了估算，并指出紧凑盘和多重间隔盘可能产生不同的内盘系外行星种群。 <div>
The mid-infrared water vapor emission spectrum provides a novel way to characterize the delivery of icy pebbles toward the innermost (<5 au) regions of planet-forming disks. Recently, JWST MIRI-MRS showed that compact disks exhibit an excess of low-energy water vapor emission relative to extended multigapped disks, suggesting that icy pebble drift is more efficient in the former. We carry out detailed emission-line modeling to retrieve the excitation conditions of rotational water vapor emission in a sample of four compact and three extended disks within the JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey. We present two-temperature H2O slab model retrievals and, for the first time, constrain the spatial distribution of water vapor by fitting parametric radial temperature and column density profiles. Such models statistically outperform the two-temperature slab fits. We find a correlation between the observable hot water vapor mass and stellar mass accretion rate, as well as an anticorrelation between cold water vapor mass and submillimeter dust disk radius, confirming previously reported water line flux trends. We find that the mid-IR spectrum traces H2O with temperatures down to 180–300 K, but the coldest 150–170 K gas remains undetected. Furthermore the H2O temperature profiles are generally steeper and cooler than the expected “superheated” dust temperature in passive irradiated disks. The column density profiles are used to estimate icy pebble mass fluxes, which suggest that compact and extended disks may produce markedly distinct inner-disk exoplanet populations if local feeding mechanisms dominate their assembly.

<div> DSNB, supernova neutrino, BH-forming SNe, event rate, experimental sensitivity
<br /><br />总结:
本研究对漫射超新星（SN）中微子背景（DSNB）的通量谱、事件率和实验灵敏度进行了研究，该中微子背景源自过去的恒星坍缩，也被称为超新星残留中微子背景。研究考虑了导致成功超新星爆发和黑洞（BH）形成的坍缩对DSNB的贡献，后者从银河系化学演化的角度来看可能是一个不可忽视的种群。如果BH形成的超新星涉及长期对原中子星的物质回落，它们的总发射中微子能量将比普通超新星和失败的超新星（BH形成而没有爆炸）大得多。然后，在正常的中微子振荡质量层次和所有核心坍缩超新星的一半都是BH形成的超新星的情况下，由于BH形成的超新星，根据当前的DSNB模型，期望的事件率增加了一倍。尽管在确定物质回落的持续时间（决定总发射中微子量）和BH形成超新星的比例方面存在实质性的不确定性，但由于这种贡献，Hyper-Kamiokande探测DSNB所需的运行时间无论如何都将缩短。 <div>
The flux spectrum, event rate, and experimental sensitivity are investigated for the diffuse supernova (SN) neutrino background (DSNB), which originates from past stellar collapses and is also known as a supernova relic neutrino background. For this purpose, the contribution of collapses that lead to successful supernova explosion and black hole (BH) formation simultaneously, which are suggested to be a nonnegligible population from the perspective of Galactic chemical evolution, is taken into account. If the BH-forming SNe involve matter fallback onto the protoneutron star for the long term, their total emitted neutrino energy becomes much larger than that of ordinary SNe and failed SNe (BH formation without explosion). Then, in the case of the normal mass hierarchy in neutrino oscillations and with half of all core-collapse SNe being BH-forming SNe, the expected event rate according to the current DSNB model is enhanced by up to a factor of 2 due to the BH-forming SNe. While substantial uncertainties exist regarding the duration of the matter fallback, which determines the total amount of emitted neutrinos, and the fraction of BH-forming SNe, the operation time required to detect the DSNB at Hyper-Kamiokande would be reduced by such contribution in any case.

总结:
研究发现，比亮度最高的GRB 221009A还要亮的伽马射线暴的发生率可能比之前估计的要高得多，这些可能来自一个独立的窄喷流GRB种群。这个种群在红移上有一个上限，以避免过度产生较暗的GRB。这可能对未来外星生命搜索产生影响。此外，窄喷流种群的能量更有利于产生超高能宇宙射线。在银河系内，有能够引发地球生命大灭绝的超亮GRB的发生率估计约为每5亿年一次。 <div>
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) brighter than the GRB 221009A, the brightest yet observed, have previously been estimated to occur at a rate of one per 10,000 yr, based on the extrapolation of the distribution of fluences of the long-GRB population. We show that bursts this bright could instead have a rate as high as approximately one per 200 yr if they are from a separate population of narrow-jet GRBs. This population must have a maximum redshift of about z ≈ 0.38 in order to avoid overproducing the observed rate of fainter GRBs. We show that it will take ≳100 yr to confirm this new population based on observing another GRB from it with a γ-ray detector; observing an orphan optical afterglow from this population with Vera Rubin Observatory or an orphan radio afterglow with the Square Kilometer Array will also take similarly long times to observe, and it is unclear if they could be distinguished from the standard GRB population. We show that the nearby narrow-jet population has more favorable energetics for producing ultra-high-energy cosmic rays than standard GRBs. The rate of bursts in the Milky Way bright enough to cause mass extinctions of life on Earth from the narrow-jet population is estimated to be approximately one per 500 Myr. This GRB population could make life in the Milky Way less likely, with implications for future searches for life on exoplanets.

总结: 
通过分析太阳动力学观测卫星的观测数据，研究人员改进了WLF识别方法，成功识别出更多的太阳白光耀斑，并得到了准确的光变曲线。研究发现，在每个GOES能级中，受限耀斑中的WLF比喷发性耀斑中更为常见。此外，WLF的能量和持续时间之间发现了一种幂律关系。研究结果表明，通过优化识别方法，可以识别更多的太阳WLF，为未来对太阳和恒星WLF的统计和比较研究奠定了基础。<br /><br /> <div>
White-light flares (WLFs) are energetic activity in the stellar atmosphere. However, observed solar WLFs are relatively rare compared to stellar WLFs or solar flares observed at other wavelengths, which limits our further understanding of solar/stellar WLFs through statistical studies. By analyzing flare observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, here we improve WLF identification methods to obtain more solar WLFs and their accurate light curves from two aspects: (1) imposing constraints defined by the typical temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of WLF-induced signals; and (2) setting the intrinsic threshold for each pixel in the flare ribbon region according to its inherent background fluctuation rather than a fixed threshold for the whole region. Applying the optimized method to 90 flares (30 C-class flares, 30 M-class flares, and 30 X-class flares) for a statistical study, we identified a total of nine C-class WLFs, 18 M-class WLFs, and 28 X-class WLFs. The WLF identification rate of C-class flares reported here reaches 30%, which is the highest to date to our best knowledge. It is also revealed that in each GOES energy level the proportion of WLFs is higher in confined flares than that in eruptive flares. Moreover, a power-law relation is found between the WLF energy (E) and duration (τ): τ ∝ E0.22, similar to those of solar hard/soft X-ray flares and other stellar WLFs. These results indicate that we could recognize more solar WLFs through optimizing the identification method, which will lay a base for future statistical and comparison study of solar and stellar WLFs.

In this study, we examine 51 archival NICER observations and six archival NuSTAR observations of the neutron star ultracompact X-ray binary (UCXB) 4U 0614+091, which span over 5 yr. The source displays persistent reflection features, so we use a reflection model designed for UCXBs, with overabundant carbon and oxygen (xillverCO) to study how various components of the system vary over time. The flux of this source is known to vary quasiperiodically on a timescale of a few days, so we study how the various model components change as the overall flux varies. The flux of most components scales linearly with the overall flux, while the power law, representing coronal emission, is anticorrelated, as expected. This is consistent with previous studies of the source. We also find that during observations of the high-soft state, the disk emissivity profile as a function of radius becomes steeper. We interpret this as the corona receding to be closer to the compact object during these states, at which point the assumed power law illumination of xillverCO may be inadequate to describe the illumination of the disk.

总结: <br />
研究使用NICER观测了4U 1820-30的15次热核X射线爆发，发现所有的爆发都显示出明显的光球半径膨胀现象。在其中一次爆发中首次观测到了超级膨胀，黑体发射半径达到902公里。研究还在其中一次爆发中发现了具有716赫兹频率的相干振荡信号，但仅为2.9σ的显著性水平。同时还观测到了爆发振荡的能量范围为3-10keV的分数rms振幅为5.8%。此外，还观测到了爆发光谱中峰值时的低电离度值。根据反射建模，推测这可能由部分相互作用的内部吸积盘或弱电离的外部盘引起。 <br /> <div>
We present the results obtained from timing and spectral studies of 15 thermonuclear X-ray bursts from 4U 1820–30 observed with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) during its 5 yr of observations between 2017 and 2022. All bursts showed clear signs of photospheric radius expansion (PRE), where the neutron star (NS) photosphere expanded more than 50 km above the surface. One of the bursts produced a superexpansion with a blackbody emission radius of 902 km for the first time with NICER. We searched for burst oscillations in all 15 bursts and found evidence of a coherent oscillation at 716 Hz in a burst, with a 2.9σ detection level based on Monte Carlo simulations. If confirmed with future observations, 4U 1820–30 would become the fastest-spinning NS known in X-ray binary systems. The fractional rms amplitude of the candidate burst oscillation was found to be 5.8% in the energy range of 3–10 keV. Following the variable persistent model from burst time-resolved spectroscopy, an anticorrelation is seen between the maximum scaling factor value and the (preburst) persistent flux. We detected a low value of ionization at the peak of each burst based on reflection modeling of burst spectra. A partially interacting inner accretion disk or a weakly ionized outer disk may cause the observed ionization dip during the PRE phase.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Synchrotron observation serves as a tool for studying magnetic fields in the interstellar medium and intracluster medium, yet its ability to unveil three-dimensional (3D) magnetic fields, meaning probing the field’s plane-of-the-sky (POS) orientation, inclination angle relative to the line of sight, and magnetization from one observational data, remains largely underexplored. Inspired by the latest insights into anisotropic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, we found that synchrotron emission’s intensity structures inherently reflect this anisotropy, providing crucial information to aid in 3D magnetic field studies: (i) the structure’s elongation gives the magnetic field’s POS orientation and (ii) the structure’s anisotropy degree and topology reveal the inclination angle and magnetization. Capitalizing on this foundation, we integrate a machine learning approach—convolutional neural network (CNN)—to extract this latent information, thereby facilitating the exploration of 3D magnetic fields. The model is trained on synthetic synchrotron emission maps, derived from 3D MHD turbulence simulations encompassing a range of sub-Alfvénic to super-Alfvénic conditions. We show that the CNN is physically interpretable and the CNN is capable of obtaining the POS orientation, inclination angle, and magnetization. Additionally, we test the CNN against the noise effect and the missing low-spatial frequency. We show that this CNN-based approach maintains a high degree of robustness even when only high-spatial frequencies are maintained. This renders the method particularly suitable for application to interferometric data lacking single-dish measurements. We applied this trained CNN to the synchrotron observations of a diffuse region. The CNN-predicted POS magnetic field orientation shows a statistical agreement with that derived from synchrotron polarization.

<div> 关键词: 宇宙射线扩散, 磁场湍流, 非线性磁旋, 粒子模拟, 磁场不均匀

总结:<br /><br />这项研究探讨了在无强磁场存在的情况下，宇宙射线在磁场湍流中的扩散问题。研究发现了三种不同的扩散机制，分别是镜像扩散、漫游扩散和磁矩散射。结果显示，CR的扩散也具有空间不均匀性，低能CR更倾向于在强磁场区域发生镜像扩散和漫游扩散，而高能CR更偏向于发生磁矩散射，这导致了CR的平均自由程（MFP）对能量的依赖性不同。这项研究强调了非线性磁旋引起的磁场不均匀性对CR扩散行为的基本作用。 <div>
The diffusion of cosmic rays (CRs) in turbulent magnetic fields is fundamental to understanding various astrophysical processes. We explore the CR diffusion in the magnetic fluctuations amplified by the nonlinear turbulent dynamo in the absence of a strong mean magnetic field. Using test particle simulations, we identify three distinct CR diffusion regimes: mirroring, wandering, and magnetic moment scattering (MMS). With highly inhomogeneous distribution of the dynamo-amplified magnetic fields, we find that the diffusion of CRs is also spatially inhomogeneous. Our results reveal that lower-energy CRs preferentially undergo the mirror and wandering diffusion in the strong-field regions, and the MMS diffusion in the weak-field regions. The former two diffusion mechanisms play a more important role toward lower CR energies, resulting in a relatively weak energy dependence of the overall CR mean free path (MFP). In contrast, higher-energy CRs predominantly undergo the MMS diffusion, for which the incomplete particle gyration, i.e., the limit case of mirroring, in strong fields has a more significant effect than the scattering by small-scale field tangling/reversal. Compared with lower-energy CRs, they are more poorly confined in space and their MFPs have a stronger energy dependence. We stress the fundamental role of magnetic field inhomogeneity of nonlinear turbulent dynamo in causing the different diffusion behavior of CRs compared to that in sub-Alfvénic magnetohydrodynamic turbulence.

<div> 关键词: dark energy, ΛXCDM模型, phantom matter, 引力波, 宇宙学数据

总结:<br /><br />本文讨论了复合暗能量的概念，认为虚空能量密度可能与其他有效的暗能量形式相结合。作者提出了wXCDM模型，并研究了phantom matter的可能性。实验结果表明，使用BAO 2D数据拟合时，H0和生长张力几乎消失。然而，使用各向异性BAO（BAO 3D）时，缓解H0张力的能力明显降低。最后，实验结果支持DE在z≃1.5以下呈现类似quintessence行为，与近期DESI测量相符。 <div>
The idea of composite dark energy (DE) is quite natural since on general grounds we expect that the vacuum energy density (associated with the cosmological term Λ) may appear in combination with other effective forms of DE, denoted X. Here we deal with model wXCDM, a simplified version of the old ΛXCDM model, and exploit the possibility that X behaves as “phantom matter” (PM), which appears in stringy versions of the running vacuum model (RVM). Unlike phantom DE, the PM fluid satisfies the strong energy condition like usual matter, hence bringing to bear positive pressure at the expense of negative energy. Bubbles of PM may appear in the manner of a transitory “phantom vacuum” tunneled into the late Universe before it heads toward a new de Sitter era, thereby offering a crop field for the growing of structures earlier than expected. Using Type Ia supernovae, cosmic chronometers, transversal baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO 2D), large-scale structure data, and the full cosmic microwave background likelihood from Planck 2018, we find that the H0 and growth tensions virtually disappear, provided that BAO 2D are the only source of BAO data used in the fit. In contrast, our preliminary analysis using exclusively anisotropic BAO (BAO 3D) indicates that the ability to ease the H0 tension is significantly reduced as compared to the scenario with BAO 2D, despite the fact that the overall fit to the cosmological data is still better than in the ΛCDM. Finally, our approach with BAO 2D favors quintessence-like behavior of the DE below z ≃ 1.5 at ≳3σ confidence level, which is compatible with the recent DESI measurements.

<div> 白矮星，磁场演化，结晶驱动发电机，电导率，对流扩散<br />
总结:<br />
本研究调查了质量≲1.05 M⊙的碳氧白矮星中生成的晶化驱动发电机产生的磁场的演化。研究表明，初始磁场强度(B0)受初始对流区大小(Rout,0)和白矮星质量的限制。在发电机阶段结束后，通过解诱导方程可以追踪磁场演化，预测的表面磁场强度(Bsurf)与B0相差至少约0.3倍，取决于Rout,0。我们实现了考虑固体相对欧姆扩散的电导率，观察到当固体核增长时电导率会增加，磁场在演化的某一点冻结，并减缓其向外传输。我们研究了对流引起的磁扩散效应，并发现对于较小的Rout,0，Bsurf比非湍流扩散情况更强，但仍比B0小数个数量级。鉴于这些限制，结晶驱动的发电机理论只能解释质量范围为0.45-1.05 M⊙的磁性C/O白矮星，其磁场强度小于几兆高斯。我们的研究结果还表明，如果结晶驱动的对流负责将埋藏的化石磁场输送到表面，则其强度必须至少比观测到的表面磁场强度大100倍。 <div>
We investigate the evolution of magnetic fields generated by the crystallization-driven dynamo in carbon–oxygen white dwarfs (WDs) with masses ≲1.05 M⊙. We use scalings for the dynamo to demonstrate that the initial magnetic field strength (B0) has an upper limit that depends on the initial convection zone size (Rout,0) and the WD mass. We solve the induction equation to follow the magnetic field evolution after the dynamo phase ends. We show that the predicted surface magnetic field strength (Bsurf) differs from B0 by at least a factor of ∼0.3. This reduction depends on Rout,0, where values smaller than half of the star radius give Bsurf ≲ 0.01 B0. We implement electrical conductivities that account for the solid phase effect on the ohmic diffusion. We observe that the conductivity increases as the solid core grows, freezing in the magnetic field at a certain point of the evolution and slowing its outward transport. We study the effect of turbulent magnetic diffusivity induced by the convection and find that for a small Rout,0, Bsurf is stronger than the nonturbulent diffusion cases because of the more rapid transport, but still orders of magnitude smaller than B0. Given these limitations, the crystallization-driven dynamo theory could explain only magnetic C/O WDs with field strengths less than a few megagauss for the mass range 0.45–1.05 M⊙. Our results also suggest that a buried fossil field must be at least 100 times stronger than observed surface fields if crystallization-driven convection is responsible for its transport to the surface.

总结:<br /><br />研究表明，光子旋涡主要在宇宙中极强的磁场中产生。光子旋涡在与原子核相互作用中可能导致显著的大角动量转移，影响了这些天体环境中的恒星核合成过程。研究中计算了贝塞尔波描述的光子旋涡与平面波光子之间的吸收跃迁概率比值。结果显示，通过在动量空间中优化入射光子旋涡的发散角度，促进了对具有大总角动量的态的激发。然而，光子旋涡的平均截面结果与平面波相同。因此，即使贝塞尔光子在天体环境中被主要产生出来，合成元素的同位素丰度并不会改变。 <div>
It is thought that photon vortices are predominantly produced in extremely strong magnetic fields in the Universe. Because the photon vortex may cause significant large angular momentum transfer in interactions with atomic nuclei, stellar nucleosynthesis in such astrophysical environments is affected. In the present study, we calculate the ratios of the photon absorption transition probabilities of photon vortices with Bessel wave to photons described by the plane wave. The result shows enhancement of excitation of states with large total angular momentum by optimization of the divergence angle of the incident photon vortex in momentum space. However, the average cross section for the photon vortex turns out to be identical with that for the plane wave. Therefore, even when Bessel photons are predominantly produced in astrophysical environments, the isotopic abundances of the synthesized elements are not changed.

总结:
太阳物理学领域长期存在一个未解之谜，即在太阳黑子区域是否存在局部磁流体力学作用。本文报道了一种磁场演化的观察模式，使得太阳黑子区域充满了复杂性和能量。这种异常模式表现为特殊的双极磁场出现，具有以下特征：（1）双极磁场出现在太阳黑子的边缘，环绕太阳黑子并以端对端的方式延伸；（2）每个双极磁场会沿着以太阳黑子为中心的弧线轨迹逐渐增长并分离两种极性；（3）在双极磁场演化过程中，在紫外线/极紫外辐射中出现圆形发光带；（4）具有这种演化模式的太阳黑子区域通常表现出强烈的太阳活动，如均匀的大型耀斑。磁场的演化模式和相关的耀斑活动表明存在局部磁流体力学作用，我们将其描述为扭曲-重新连接的动力机制。 <div>
In solar physics, a long-unanswered question is whether or not there are local dynamos acting in sunspot regions. Here we report an observed pattern of magnetic evolution that makes the sunspots alive with ample complexity and energy. This anomalous pattern manifests as peculiar bipolar magnetic emergences (BMEs), exhibiting the following characteristics: (1) the BMEs persistently appear beyond the penumbra, encircling the sunspot in an end-to-end configuration; (2) each BME gradually grows and separates its two polarities along an arc trajectory centered on the sunspot; (3) a circular brightening belt is manifested in the ultraviolet/extreme-ultraviolet radiations during the BMEs’ evolution; and (4) the sunspot regions with such an evolution pattern often exhibit vigorous solar activity, such as homogeneous major flares. The magnetic evolving pattern and relevant flare activity indicate the presence of a local dynamo, and we characterize it as a twisting-reconnecting dynamo.

<div> 关键词: Magellanic Clouds, Hubble Space Telescope, stellar population properties, star formation histories, radial age gradient
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章主要研究了大麦哲伦云附近的相互作用的矮星系及其恒星群体特性的空间趋势。研究利用斯科拉纯并行计划获得的哈勃空间望远镜图像和现有的档案数据，对大麦哲伦云内111个个体区域的星际颜色-星等图进行了生存历史拟合。研究发现，目前的径向年龄梯度从内部盘面的内向梯度转变为在大约2个盘面尺度长度之外的外向梯度，在较早的回溯时期梯度相对较平缓，而反转的位置在回溯时间上保持不变。文章还将观测到的径向年龄趋势与固定质量的其他晚期星系进行了比较，并讨论了在可能的驱动因素背景下的相似性和差异性，暗示了在大麦哲伦云中存在着强烈的径向迁移。 <div>
The proximity of the Magellanic Clouds provides the opportunity to study interacting dwarf galaxies near a massive host, and spatial trends in their stellar population properties in particular, with a unique level of detail. The Scylla pure parallel program has obtained deep (80% complete to >1 mag below the ancient main-sequence turnoff), homogeneous two-filter Hubble Space Telescope imaging sampling the inner star-forming disk of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the perfect complement to shallower, contiguous ground-based surveys. We harness this imaging together with extant archival data and fit lifetime star formation histories (SFHs) to resolved color–magnitude diagrams of 111 individual fields, using three different stellar evolutionary libraries. We validate per-field recovered distances and extinctions, as well as the combined global LMC age–metallicity relation and SFH against independent estimates. We find that the present-day radial age gradient reverses from an inside-out gradient in the inner disk to an outside-in gradient beyond ∼2 disk scale lengths, supported by ground-based measurements. The gradients become relatively flatter at earlier look-back times, while the location of the inversion remains constant over an order of magnitude in look-back time, from ∼1 to 10 Gyr. This suggests at least one mechanism that predates the recent intense LMC–Small Magellanic Cloud interaction. We compare observed radial age trends to other late-type galaxies at fixed stellar mass and discuss similarities and differences in the context of potential drivers, implying strong radial migration in the LMC.

Indirect methods have proven to be a complementary approach for extending our knowledge of nuclear structure and low-energy cross sections. Among these, the neutron-induced reaction cross sections appear to be of particular interest since their role both for unstable and stable beams. In view of this, we report here the combined study of the 17O(n, α)14C reaction accomplished by the Trojan Horse Method (THM) and the asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC) method. The low-lying 8038, 8125, 8213, and 8282 keV resonances in 18O are studied, and their Γn are derived. A comparison with recent direct data and recent THM experimental data is presented. The independent ANC investigation corroborates our previous THM results, confirms the consistence of the two indirect investigations, and shows new frontiers for neutron-induced reactions with radioactive ion beams. Moreover, we examined the impact of adopting the newly recommended 17O(n, α)14C reaction rate on asymptotic giant branch stars' nucleosynthesis. Our findings reveal significant variations (≳10%) in the production of the neutron-rich heavy isotopes sensitive to neutron density, underlining the neutron-poisoning effect of 17O on the s-process.

这篇文章对两颗新发现的Ba巨星进行了详细的化学特征研究，并确认它们是外部s-过程星。通过高分辨率的UVES光谱观测，测量了22种元素的丰度，发现它们在所有测量的s-过程元素上都有明显的富集。此外，两颗星都表现出了轨道速度的变化，很可能是双星系统。在Eu元素上的轻微富集表明污染源是纯s-过程来源。这些新发现的双星系统的丰度与传统的Ba巨星相符，为更好地理解AGB星体内的s-过程提供了观测约束。 
<br /> <div>
Barium (Ba) stars are chemically peculiar stars that show enhanced surface abundances of heavy elements produced by the slow-neutron-capture process, the so-called s-process. These stars are not sufficiently evolved to undergo the s-process in their interiors, so they are considered products of binary interactions. Ba stars form when a former Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) companion, which is now a white dwarf, pollutes them with s-process-rich material through mass transfer. This paper presents a detailed chemical characterization of two newly discovered Ba giants. Our main goal is to confirm their status as extrinsic s-process stars and explore potential binarity and white dwarf companions. We obtained high-resolution spectra with UVES on the Very Large Telescope to determine the chemical properties of the targets. We perform line-by-line analyses and measure 22 elements with an internal precision up to 0.04 dex. The binary nature of the targets is investigated through radial velocity variability and spectral energy distribution fitting. We found that both targets are enhanced in all the measured s-process elements, classifying our targets as Ba giants. This is the first time they are classified as such in the literature. Additionally, both stars present a mild enhancement in Eu, but less than in pure s-process elements, suggesting that the sources that polluted them were pure s-process sources. Finally, we confirmed that the two targets are RV variable and likely binary systems. The abundances in these two newly discovered polluted binaries align with classical Ba giants, providing observational constraints to better understand the s-process in AGB stars.

Transmission spectroscopy is the most widely used technique for studying exoplanet atmospheres. Since the planetary nightside faces the observer during a transit, highly irradiated giant exoplanets with warm nightsides emit thermal radiation that can contaminate transmission spectra. Observations of ultrahot Jupiters in the near- and mid-infrared with JWST are especially susceptible to nightside contamination. However, nightside thermal emission is generally not considered in atmospheric retrievals of exoplanet transmission spectra. Here, we quantify the potential biases from neglecting nightside thermal emission in multidimensional atmospheric retrievals of an ultrahot Jupiter. Using simulated JWST transmission spectra of the ultrahot Jupiter WASP-33b (0.8–12 μm), we find that transmission spectrum retrievals without nightside emission can overestimate molecular abundances by almost an order of magnitude and underestimate the dayside temperature by ≳400 K. We show that a modified retrieval prescription, including both transmitted light and nightside thermal emission, correctly recovers the atmospheric properties and is favored by Bayesian model comparisons. Nightside thermal contamination can be readily implemented in retrieval models via a first-order approximation, and we provide formulae to estimate whether this effect is likely to be significant for a given planet. We recommend that nightside emission should be included as standard practice when interpreting ultrahot Jupiter transmission spectra with JWST.

<br /><br />在矮星系中检测活动黑洞一直是一项艰巨的任务，因为它们的体积小、电磁信号弱。然而，中红外变异性已经成为一种有前景的工具，可以用来检测矮星系中的活跃低质量黑洞。作者分析了AllWISE/NEOWISE多时期目录中10.4年的光度数据，发现了25个表现出类星体活性的物体。通过光学和近红外诊断，独立确认了这些物体中68%的AGN活动。此外，在样本中最低恒星质量（log M* = 7.5 M⊙）和低金属丰度（12 + log(O/H) = 7.46）的J1205中发现了近红外冕线[S ix] λ 1.252 μm。此外，两个目标中观测到的广Paα线可能来自宽线区域，其推断的黑洞质量与黑洞-恒星质量关系一致。虽然作者发现在相似恒星质量和Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer W1 − W2颜色的非变异性星系中并没有明显趋势，但他们发现AGN活动可能导致变异目标中W1 − W2颜色较红，而在非变异性星系中，这种贡献来自强烈的恒星形成活动。此外，变异目标中也观测到了高比例的光学宽线。研究结果表明，中红外变异性是一种有效的方法，可以用来检测低质量星系中的AGN活动，并有助于发现宇宙中更大样本的活跃低质量(<106M⊙)黑洞。 <div>
Detecting active black holes in dwarf galaxies has proven to be a challenge due to their small size and weak electromagnetic signatures. Mid-infrared variability has emerged as a promising tool that can be used to detect active low-mass black holes in dwarf galaxies. We analyzed 10.4 yr of photometry from the AllWISE/NEOWISE multiepoch catalogs, identifying 25 objects with active galactic nuclei (AGN)-like variability. Independent confirmation of AGN activity was found in 68% of these objects using optical and near-infrared diagnostics. Notably, we discover a near-infrared coronal line [S ix] λ 1.252 μm in J1205, the galaxy with the lowest stellar mass (log M* = 7.5 M⊙) and low metallicity (12 + log(O/H) = 7.46) in our sample. Additionally, we find broad Paα potentially from the broad-line region in two targets, and their implied black hole masses are consistent with black hole-stellar mass relations. Comparing nonvariable galaxies with similar stellar masses and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer W1 − W2 colors, we find no clear trends between variability and large-scale galaxy properties. However, we find that AGN activity likely causes redder W1 − W2 colors in variable targets, while for the nonvariable galaxies, the contribution stems from strong star formation activity. A high incidence of optical broad lines was also observed in variable targets. Our results suggest that mid-infrared variability is an effective method for detecting AGN activity in low-mass galaxies and can help uncover a larger sample of active low-mass (<106M⊙) black holes in the Universe.

We present a new grid of cloudy atmosphere and evolution models for substellar objects. These models include the effect of refractory cloud species, including silicate clouds, on the spectra and evolution. We include effective temperatures from 900 to 2400 K and surface gravities from log g = 3.5 to 5.5, appropriate for a broad range of objects with masses between 1 and 84 MJ. Model pressure–temperature structures are calculated assuming radiative–convective and chemical equilibrium. We consider the effect of both clouds and metallicity on the atmospheric structure, resulting spectra, and thermal evolution of substellar worlds. We parameterize clouds using the A. S. Ackerman & M. S. Marley cloud model, including cloud parameter fsed values from 1 to 8; we include three metallicities (−0.5, 0.0, and +0.5). Refractory clouds and metallicity both alter the evolution of substellar objects, changing the inferred temperature at a given age by up to 100–200 K. For solar-metallicity evolution models including clouds in warm objects, we find a hydrogen-burning minimum mass of 70.2 MJ, close to empirical measurements; we find a deuterium-burning minimum mass of 12.05 MJ (50% of initial D burned). We compare to the observed photometry of brown dwarfs, finding broad agreement with the measured photometry. We publish the spectra, evolution, and other data products online with open access on Zenodo (doi:10.5281/zenodo.12735103).

<div> 关键词: 反馈驱动、大规模流出、星系演化、光学深度、SALT模型
总结:<br /><br />该研究探讨了反馈驱动的大规模流出在星系演化中的关键作用。通过对光学深度方法和SALT模型两种方法的比较分析，发现前者可能会低估大气柱密度，特别是在光学厚的情况下。模拟结果显示，这种差异的主要原因是在低速度下存在大量的密集物质，而这些物质可能会被有限的光谱分辨率所隐藏。因此，对于1D光谱的外流性质推断中存在着一定的不确定性，需要更加精细的建模和分析。 <div>
Feedback-driven massive outflows play a crucial role in galaxy evolution by regulating star formation and influencing the dynamics of surrounding media. Extracting outflow properties from spectral lines is a notoriously difficult process for a number of reasons, including the possibility that a substantial fraction of the outflow is carried by dense gas in a very narrow range in velocity. This gas can hide in spectra with insufficient resolution. Empirically motivated analysis based on the apparent optical depth method, commonly used in the literature, neglects the contribution of this gas, and may therefore underestimate the true gas column density. More complex semianalytical line transfer (e.g., SALT) models, on the other hand, allow for the presence of this gas by modeling the radial density and velocity of the outflows as power laws. Here we compare the two approaches to quantify the uncertainties in the inferences of outflow properties based on 1D “down-the-barrel” spectra, using the UV spectra of the CLASSY galaxy sample. We find that empirical modeling may significantly underestimate the column densities relative to SALT analysis, particularly in the optically thick regime. We use simulations to show that the main reason for this discrepancy is the presence of a large amount of dense material at low velocities, which can be hidden by the finite spectral resolution of the data. The SALT models in turn could overestimate the column densities if the assumed power laws of the density profiles are not a property of actual outflows.

<title>Accreting Neutron Stars in 3D General-relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations: Jets, Magnetic Polarity, and the Interchange Slingshot</title>

<div> 关键词: accreting neutron stars, magnetic field, disk structure, jet power, general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations<br />
<br />总结:<br />文章讨论了增积中子星与黑洞的不同之处，重点在于增积中子星自身的磁场对增积流的影响。研究了两种极端情况下的3D广义相对论磁流体力学模拟，发现了不同磁场方向对系统性质的影响。当磁层在共转半径附近截断盘时，系统的大部分特性都与星-盘相对极性无关。然而，当盘 extends well inside the corotation radius时，与初始盘磁场平行方向下，喷流功率被抑制，内盘密度较低并且磁化更强。提出了可能解释这种行为的物理机制，即交换弹射，并讨论了其天体物理学意义。当星处于快速增积状态时，我们预期两种磁场方向之间会有较大的观测差异，这可能反映为随着增积流带入连续磁结构的不同极性而增加的变化。 <div>
Accreting neutron stars differ from black holes by the presence of the star’s own magnetic field, whose interaction with the accretion flow is a central component in understanding these systems’ disk structure, outflows, jets, and spin evolution. It also introduces an additional degree of freedom, as the stellar dipole can have any orientation relative to the inner disk’s magnetic field. We present a suite of 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations in which we investigate the two extreme polarities, with the dipole field being either parallel or antiparallel to the initial disk field, in both the accreting and propeller states. When the magnetosphere truncates the disk near or beyond the corotation radius, most of the system’s properties, including the relativistic jet power, are independent of the star–disk relative polarity. However, when the disk extends well inside the corotation radius, in the parallel orientation the jet power is suppressed and the inner disk is less dense and more strongly magnetized. We suggest a physical mechanism that may account for this behavior—the interchange slingshot—and discuss its astrophysical implications. When the star is in the rapidly accreting regime, which in most cases will be associated with strong spin-up, we expect large observational differences between the two magnetic orientations. This may be reflected in increased variability as the accretion flow drags in successive magnetic structures of varying polarity.

We conducted a comprehensive variability analysis of the blazar PKS 2255-282 using Fermi-LAT observations spanning over 4 yr, from MJD 57783.5 to 59358.5. Our analysis revealed a transient quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) with a period of 93 ± 2.6 days. We employed a variety of Fourier-based methods, including the Lomb–Scargle periodogram (LSP) and weighted wavelet Z-transform (WWZ), as well as time domain analysis techniques such as seasonal and nonseasonal autoregressive Integrated moving average models and the Stochastic modeling with stochastically driven damped harmonic oscillator models. Consistently, the QPO with a period of 93 days was detected across all methods used. The observed peak in LSP and time-averaged WWZ plots has a significance level of 4.06σ and 3.96σ, respectively. To understand the source of flux modulations in the light curve, we explored various physical models. A plausible scenario involves the precession of the jet with a high Lorentz factor or the movement of a plasma blob along a helical trajectory within the relativistic jet.

本研究提出了一个新的量化指标"维数净自旋"，用于描述双黑洞系统中组成黑洞的角动量之和，为探索双黑洞的形成途径提供了新的视角。通过对维数净自旋的分层贝叶斯推断，发现其分布更适合由两个高斯分布组成，且其分布的分支比率随着总质量和红移而变化。研究发现高自旋系统可能主导了高质量双黑洞的形成，并随着红移的变化而快速演化。这些发现对双星形成模型提出了新的挑战，并暗示动力学过程可能在高总质量双黑洞的形成中起着关键作用。 <div>
The spins of binary black holes (BBHs) measured from gravitational waves contain valuable information about their formation pathways. In this study, we propose a new quantity, the “dimensionless net spin” (χN), which relates to the sum of the angular momenta of the component black holes (BHs) in the system, offering a novel perspective for exploring the origins of BBHs. Through hierarchical Bayesian inference on χN, we find strong evidence that its distribution is better described by two Gaussian components rather than one, and their branching ratios vary with total mass and redshift: there is a narrow peak at χN ∼ 0.15 and an extended peak at χN ∼ 0.3–0.6. The rapidly spinning systems likely dominate the high-mass end of the population and evolve with redshift more quickly. These findings present new challenges to the field binary formation scenario and suggest that dynamical processes may play a key role in the formation of high total mass BBHs.

<title>Merging Signatures in an Offset Lyman Continuum Emitter at Redshift 3.8</title>

总结:<br />
该研究关注高红移（z>3）的Lyman连续体（LyC）发射源，这些样本对于研究星系在再电离时期对离子化背景的贡献至关重要。研究收集了一组z>3的LyC发射源，其中有60%–70%的样本显示LyC发射和非电离连续发射之间的空间偏移。特别是，发现了一个偏移的LyC发射源CDFS-6664（z=3.797），在Hubble Space Telescope和James Webb Space Telescope的高分辨率图像中显示两个组分。CDFS-6664的丰富数据集使研究能够在多个波长提取两个组分并估算其物理特性。研究表明，CDFS-6664与一个主要融合系统一致，两个组分的星形成均得到提升，且偏移的LyC发射很可能与这个融合系统中较蓝、较年轻的组分有关。这一结果为融合在LyC光子逸出中的作用提供了一个例子。未来的观测将阐明融合对LyC光子逸出的作用。 <div>
Lyman continuum (LyC) emitters at z > 3 provide critical samples for studying the contribution of galaxies to the ionizing background in the epoch of reionization. We collect a sample of z > 3 LyC emitters, a dominant fraction (∼60%–70%) of which show spatial offsets between LyC emission and the nonionizing continuum. From this sample, especially, we find a case of an offset LyC emitter, CDFS-6664 (z = 3.797), which shows two components in the high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope images. The exceptionally rich data set of CDFS-6664 enables us to extract the two components across multiple wavelengths and estimate their physical properties. We show that CDFS-6664 is consistent with a major merger system with boosted star formation in both components and that the offset LyC emission is most likely associated with the bluer and younger component in this merging system. Our result offers an example in which the offset can be caused by a merger. Future observations of more offset LyC emitters would elucidate the role that mergers play in the escape of LyC photons.

<div> 关键词: 磁气动力学扭曲不稳定性、日冕质量抛射、太阳活动周期、磁场强度、太阳黑子<br />
<br />总结: 本研究旨在探寻磁气动力学扭曲不稳定性的临界高度在太阳活动周期中的演变。通过对来自1996年至2023年的Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)和Michelson Doppler Imager Space-Weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARPs和SMARPs)的大量磁图进行分析，发现太阳活动周期影响着活跃区的临界高度，太阳极大期观察到更高的临界高度，主要原因是活跃区的总磁通量和极性之间的分离距离与临界高度成正比，而太阳极大期观察到更多磁通量更大、尺寸更大的磁区。这个发现引人注目，因为尽管临界高度较高，太阳极大期观察到的日冕质量抛射比太阳极小期更多。 <div>
The ideal magnetohydrodynamic torus instability can drive the eruption of coronal mass ejections. The critical threshold of magnetic field strength decay for the onset of the torus instability occurs at different heights in different solar active regions, and understanding this variation could therefore improve space weather prediction. In this work, we aim to find out how the critical torus instability height evolves throughout the solar activity cycle. We study a significant subset of Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) and Michelson Doppler Imager Space-Weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARPs and SMARPs) from 1996 to 2023, totaling 21,584 magnetograms from 4436 unique active-region patches. For each magnetogram, we compute the critical height averaged across the main polarity inversion line, the total unsigned magnetic flux, and the separation between the positive and negative magnetic polarities. We find the critical height in active regions varies with the solar cycle, with higher (lower) average critical heights observed around solar maximum (minimum). We conclude that this is because the critical height is proportional to the separation between opposite magnetic polarities, which in turn is proportional to the total magnetic flux in a region, and more magnetic regions with larger fluxes and larger sizes are observed at solar maximum. This result is noteworthy because, despite the higher critical heights, more coronal mass ejections are observed around solar maximum than at solar minimum.

总结:<br /><br />本研究分析了活跃星系核1ES 1927+654的多时期宽带光谱能量分布，揭示了其复杂、时变的吸积流特性。吸积率的衰减与1.1 M⊙恒星的潮汐破坏一致。光谱能量分布存在三个组成部分：类似超薄盘的中心过热区域、外部截断的薄盘以及热辐射区。高初始吸积率引发的超薄盘中的光子捕获表现出低辐射效率（3%），随后吸积率降至足够低时，盘转变为几何薄状态，辐射效率增加至8%。内部过热区域的黑体温度剖面T∝R-0.60符合超薄盘的理论预期，而外部区域的有效温度剖面T∝R-0.69与薄盘的预测相一致。两个剖面朝向盘的内边界均呈现出扁平化，这是因为辐射区内的康普顿冷却。本研究为超薄吸积盘的存在提供了令人信服的观测证据，并阐明了其行为的关键参数，为该领域的进一步探索铺平了道路。 <div>
The properties of slim accretion disks, while crucial for our understanding of black hole growth, have yet to be studied extensively observationally. We analyze the multiepoch broadband spectral energy distribution of the changing-look active galactic nucleus 1ES 1927+654 to derive the properties of its complex, time-dependent accretion flow. The accretion rate decays as , consistent with the tidal disruption of a 1.1 M⊙ star. Three components contribute to the spectral energy distribution: a central overheated zone resembling a slim disk, an outer truncated thin disk, and a hot corona. Photon trapping in the slim disk triggered by the high initial was characterized by a low radiation efficiency (3%), which later more than doubled (8%) after dropped sufficiently low for the disk to transition to a geometrically thin state. The blackbody temperature profile T ∝ R−0.60 for the inner overheated zone matches the theoretical expectations of a slim disk, while the effective temperature profile of T ∝ R−0.69 for the outer zone is consistent with the predictions of a thin disk. Both profiles flatten toward the inner boundary of the disk as a result of Compton cooling in the corona. Our work presents compelling observational evidence for the existence of slim accretion disks and elucidates the key parameters governing their behavior, paving the way for further exploration in this area.

总结:
米尔基亚路亚系周围介质中存在约10^6K的气体已经得到了充分证实。然而，新发现的约10^7K的“超维里尔”（SV）温度的热气体的位置和来源一直令人困惑。本文聚焦于排放气体，发现在排放状态下，“维里尔”和SV温度的气体占据了类似盘状的超平面区域，而不仅是充满了米尔基亚路亚系的弥散维里尔温度气体。我们进行理想的流体动力学模拟，结果显示约10^7K的排放气体很可能是在银河盘内外产生的恒星反馈的结果。此外，我们还发现超平面区域内的SV和维里尔温度排放气体富含金属，且不处于与米尔基亚路亚系相平衡的状态，而是不断演化着。<br /><br /> <div>
The presence of the ≈106 K gas in the circumgalactic medium of the Milky Way (MW) has been well established. However, the location and the origin of the newly discovered hot gas at “supervirial (SV)” temperatures of ≈107 K have been puzzling. This hot gas has been detected in both absorption and emission; here, we focus on the emitting gas only. We show that both the “virial” and the SV temperature gas, as observed in emission, occupy disk-like extraplanar regions, in addition to the diffuse virial temperature gas filling the halo of the MW. We perform idealized hydrodynamical simulations to show that the ≈107 K emitting gas is likely to be produced by stellar feedback in and around the Galactic disk. We further show that the emitting gas at both SV and virial temperatures in the extraplanar regions is metal enriched and is not in hydrostatic equilibrium with the halo but is continuously evolving.

We use the nonobservation of strong lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) in the first three observation runs of the LIGO and Virgo detectors to constrain the fraction of dark matter in the form of compact objects (COs) in the mass range 106−109M⊙. Using a Bayesian formalism supplemented by astrophysical simulations of strong lensing of GWs, we constrain the compact dark matter fraction to ≲0.4−0.6 with currently available data and show that they may get significantly tighter in the future. We find that multiple lensing—i.e., GWs getting deflected by multiple COs on their way to us—is possible. By ignoring this, we underestimate the constraints by a few percent.

太阳孔是理想的磁结构，可用于波传播和能量传输。研究模拟了具有光桥的孔的磁流激发和传播。通过数值求解磁气动力学方程，并计算环流来测量扭转运动。发现磁流之间的相互作用导致了自然激发的扭转阿尔文波，而单个磁流模型中没有扭转波。扭转阿尔文波的传播速度与波幅峰值处的局部阿尔文速度相匹配。 <div>
Solar pores are ideal magnetic structures for wave propagation and transport of energy radially outwards across the upper layers of the solar atmosphere. We aim to model the excitation and propagation of magnetohydrodynamic waves in a pore with a light bridge modeled as two interacting magnetic flux tubes separated by a thin, weaker-field layer. We solve the three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic equations numerically and calculate the circulation as a measure of net torsional motion. We find that the interaction between flux tubes results in the natural excitation of propagating torsional Alfvén waves but find no torsional waves in the model with a single flux tube. The torsional Alfvén waves propagate with wave speeds matching the local Alfvén speed where wave amplitude peaks.

While rotation-supported gas disks are known to exist as early as at z ≈ 7, it is still a general belief that stellar disks form late in the Universe. This picture is now being challenged by the observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which have revealed a large number of disk-like galaxies that could be at z > 3, with some being candidates at z > 7. As an early formation of stellar disks will greatly impact our theory of galaxy formation and evolution, it is important to determine when such systems first emerged. Here we present D-CEERS-RUBIES-z5289 at z = 5.289 ± 0.001, the second confirmed stellar disk at z > 5, discovered using the archival JWST NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec spectroscopic data. This galaxy has a highly regular edge-on disk morphology, extends to ∼6.2 kpc along its major axis, and has an effective radius of ∼1.3–1.4 kpc. Such a large stellar disk is yet to be produced in numerical simulations. By analyzing its 10-band spectral energy distribution using four different tools, we find that it has a high stellar mass of 109.5–10.0M⊙. Its age is in the range of 330–510 Myr, and it has a mild star formation rate of 10–30 M⊙ yr−1. While the current spectroscopic data do not allow the derivation of its rotation curve, the width of its Hα line from the partial slit coverage on one side of the disk reaches ∼345 km s−1, which suggests that it could have a significant contribution from rotation.

The proximity of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC) provides the opportunity to study the impact of dwarf–dwarf interactions on their mass assembly with a unique level of detail. To this end, we analyze two-filter broadband imaging of 83 Hubble Space Telescope (HST) pointings covering 0.203 deg2 toward the SMC, extending out to ∼3.5 kpc in projection from its optical center. Lifetime star formation histories (SFHs) fit to each pointing independently reveal an outside-in age gradient such that fields in the SMC outskirts are older on average. We measure radial gradients of the look-back time to form 90%, 75%, and 50% of the cumulative stellar mass for the first time, finding δ(τ90, τ75, τ50)/δR = (0.61 , , ) Gyr kpc−1 assuming PARSEC evolutionary models and a commonly used elliptical geometry of the SMC, although our results are robust to these assumptions. The wing of the SMC deviates from this trend, forming 25% of its cumulative mass over the most recent 3 Gyr owing to a best-fit star formation rate that remains approximately constant. Our results are consistent with chemodynamical evidence of a tidally stripped SMC component in the foreground and imply contributions to the observed SFH from multiple previous LMC–SMC interactions. We also compare our SMC SFH with results from a companion study of the LMC, finding that while the two galaxies present different internal, spatially resolved SFH trends, both the LMC and SMC have similar near-constant lifetime SFHs when viewed globally.

<div> 关键词: 金属贫乏星，星际震荡，恒星模型，年龄测量，银河形成历史<br />
总结: 本研究报告了发现KIC 8144907，这颗低光度的Kepler红巨星具有高信噪比的振荡，其金属丰度为[Fe/H] = −2.66 ± 0.08，[α/Fe] = 0.38 ± 0.06，这使得它成为迄今为止可以进行详细星际震荡建模的最金属贫乏的恒星。结合Kepler的振荡频谱和高分辨率光谱，测量得到了这颗星的星际质量和年龄，分别为0.79 ± 0.02(ran) ± 0.01(sys) M⊙ 和 12.0 ± 0.6(ran) ± 0.4(sys) Gyr。这些结果表明，恒星模型和星际震荡在金属贫乏恒星的研究中是可靠的。此外，这些结果还为银河早期的形成提供了直接的年龄锚定，表明银河的星体形成直到红移z ≈ 3才开始（如果这颗星是原地形成），或者银河至少经历了约12亿年的并购事件（如果这颗星是通过形成Gaia-Enceladus等矮星体合并而来）。 <br /> <div>
Very-metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] < −2) are important laboratories for testing stellar models and reconstructing the formation history of our galaxy. Asteroseismology is a powerful tool to probe stellar interiors and measure ages, but few asteroseismic detections are known in very-metal-poor stars and none have allowed detailed modeling of oscillation frequencies. We report the discovery of a low-luminosity Kepler red giant (KIC 8144907) with high signal-to-noise ratio oscillations, [Fe/H] = −2.66 ± 0.08 and [α/Fe] = 0.38 ± 0.06, making it by far the most metal-poor star to date for which detailed asteroseismic modeling is possible. By combining the oscillation spectrum from Kepler with high-resolution spectroscopy, we measure an asteroseismic mass and age of 0.79 ± 0.02(ran) ± 0.01(sys) M⊙ and 12.0 ± 0.6(ran) ± 0.4(sys) Gyr, with remarkable agreement across different codes and input physics, demonstrating that stellar models and asteroseismology are reliable for very-metal-poor stars when individual frequencies are used. The results also provide a direct age anchor for the early formation of the Milky Way, implying that substantial star formation did not commence until redshift z ≈ 3 (if the star formed in situ) or that the Milky Way has undergone merger events for at least ≈12 Gyr (if the star was accreted by a dwarf satellite merger such as Gaia-Enceladus).

总结:
本研究利用2.5D完全动力学模拟，研究了帕克太阳探测器观察到的具有非均向性束流的质子速度分布函数的稳定性。研究发现，在具有核心和非均向性束流的构造中，质子束流不稳定性会产生几乎平行的快磁声模式。在不稳定性达到饱和之前，波会与束流质子进行共振相互作用，导致垂直加热以牺牲平行温度。这些发现为太阳风等离子体的行为提供了新的复杂特征。 <div>
The expanding solar wind plasma ubiquitously exhibits anisotropic nonthermal particle velocity distributions. Typically, proton velocity distribution functions (VDFs) show the presence of a core and a field-aligned beam. Novel observations made by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) in the innermost heliosphere have revealed new complex features in the proton VDFs, namely anisotropic beams that sometimes experience perpendicular diffusion. In this study, we use a 2.5D fully kinetic simulation to investigate the stability of proton VDFs with anisotropic beams observed by PSP. Our setup consists of a core and an anisotropic beam population that drift with respect to each other. This configuration triggers a proton beam instability from which nearly parallel fast magnetosonic modes develop. Our results demonstrate that before this instability reaches saturation, the waves resonantly interact with the beam protons, causing perpendicular heating at the expense of the parallel temperature.

<title>Can Supernovae from Runaway Stars Mimic the Signs of Absorbing “Supervirial” Gas?</title>

这篇论文研究了在银河系周围介质中检测到的高度电离气体吸收线现象。研究提出了一种新颖的观点，认为这些观测到的现象可能不是来自于银河系的环绕介质，而是来自于超新星（SN）的恶性排放，这些超新星源于银河盘上方的离子星。研究发现，关联的超新星遗迹中的反冲冲击在早期非辐射相可以将排放物加热到大约10^7K的温度，这可以很自然地解释观测到的高电离气体的高柱密度等现象。然而，来自离子星的超新星的覆盖率仅为0.7%，因此只能解释有限的视线方向的观测现象。 
<br />总结: 检测到银河系周围介质中的高度电离气体吸收线现象；这些现象可能源自于银河盘上方的超新星恶性排放；超新星遗迹中的反冲冲击可以解释这些观测现象；离子星的超新星只能解释有限的视线方向现象。 <div>
The recent detection of large column density absorption lines from highly ionized gas in a few directions through the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way (MW) has been puzzling. The inferred temperature from these absorption lines far exceeds the virial temperature of the MW, and the column densities are also too large to be easily explained. In this paper, we propose a novel idea to explain these observations and claim that they may not have originated from the CGM, but from a totally different type of source, namely, stellar ejecta from supernovae (SNe) above the Galactic disk that happen to lie in the line of sight to the background quasars. About ∼20% of massive OB stars (progenitors of core-collapse supernovae) are known to be runaway stars that have high ejection velocities near the Galactic plane and can end up exploding as SNe above the Galactic disk. We show that the associated reverse shock in the supernova remnant in the early nonradiative phase can heat the ejecta to temperatures of ≳107 K and can naturally explain the observed high column density of ions in the observed “supervirial” phase along with α-enriched supersolar abundance that is typical of core-collapse supernovae. However, SNe from runaway stars has a covering fraction of ≲0.7% and thus can only explain the observations along limited sightlines.

<div> 太阳耀斑，磁场，SDO，太阳活动，重新连接
<br /><br />总结:
研究报道了七个被忽视的狭隘太阳耀斑爆发的例子，这种类型的爆发不符合标准的模型。这些“隐形非标准模型狭隘耀斑爆发”源自太阳黑子。通过SDO的观测，研究者详细追踪了其中两次爆发的过程，并提出了爆发前磁场配置的假设图。研究发现，这些爆发是由于在交叉的内部场线之间的界面上发生突然的重新连接而形成的。这些发现支持了Parker关于太阳日冕磁力线加热的假设。 <div>
We report seven examples of a long-ignored type of confined solar flare eruption that does not fit the standard model for confined flare eruptions. Because they are confined eruptions, do not fit the standard model, and unexpectedly erupt in ostensibly inert magnetic arches, we have named them stealth non-standard-model confined flare eruptions. Each of our flaring magnetic arches stems from a big sunspot. We tracked each eruption in full-cadence UV and EUV images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly of Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) in combination with magnetograms from SDO’s Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager. We present the onset and evolution of two eruptions in detail: one of six that each makes two side-by-side main flare loops, and one that makes two crossed main flare loops. For these two cases, we present cartoons of the proposed pre-eruption field configuration and how sudden reconnection makes the flare ribbons and flare loops. Each of the seven eruptions is consistent with being made by sudden reconnection at an interface between two internal field strands of the magnetic arch, where they cross at a small (10°–20°) angle. These stealth non-standard-model confined flare eruptions therefore plausibly support the idea of E. N. Parker for coronal heating in solar coronal magnetic loops by nanoflare bursts of reconnection at interfaces of internal field strands that cross at angles of 10°–20°.

NGC 602是位于小麦哲伦星系中的一个年轻星团，通过JWST观测到了第一批富含棕矮星候选体（cBD），这些cBD的金属丰度低于太阳，质量在0.05到0.08太阳质量之间。这意味着在非银河系的年轻星团中发现了棕矮星，这一发现对于完善我们对极低金属丰度和年轻年龄下的次太阳质量天体的认识意义重大。需要进一步研究以量化初始质量函数并确认cBD的真实性。这些cBD在空间分布上与主序前恒星位于相同位置。 <div>
We present the discovery of the first rich population of brown dwarf candidates (cBD) at subsolar metallicity, observed by JWST outside the Milky Way (MW) in the young SMC star cluster NGC 602. Located in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) “wing,” in a very low-density environment (1.3 cm−3) and at subsolar metallicity, NGC 602 is very young, with an age of 2–3 Myr. The low stellar density in this star cluster together with JWST NIRCam images in eight filters allowed us to individually resolve and derive accurate photometric measurements for 64 candidate BDs with masses ranging from 0.05 to 0.08 M⊙ or 50 to 84 MJup, according to brown dwarf (BD) evolutionary models. This is the first detection of a young BD population outside the MW. Their spatial distribution indicates that they appear colocated with the pre-main-sequence stars. Although further detailed work is required to quantitatively derive the initial mass function and confirm the true nature of the cBD, this discovery is particularly relevant in the effort to refine our understanding of the subsolar mass function at very low metallicities and young ages.

Over the past three decades, multiple reverberation mapping (RM) campaigns conducted for the quasar PG 2130+099 have exhibited inconsistent findings with time delays ranging from ∼10 to ∼200 days. To achieve a comprehensive understanding of the geometry and dynamics of the broad-line region (BLR) in PG 2130+099, we continued an ongoing high-cadence RM monitoring campaign using the Calar Alto Observatory 2.2 m optical telescope for an extra four years from 2019 to 2022. We measured the time lags of several broad emission lines (including He ii, He i, Hβ, and Fe ii) with respect to the 5100 Å continuum, and their time lags continuously vary through the years. Especially, the Hβ time lags exhibited approximately a factor of 2 increase in the last two years. Additionally, the velocity-resolved time delays of the broad Hβ emission line reveal a back-and-forth change between signs of virial motion and inflow in the BLR. The combination of negligible (∼10%) continuum change and substantial time-lag variation (over 2 times) results in a significant scatter in the intrinsic RHβ–L5100 relationship for PG 2130+099. Taking the consistent changes in the continuum variability time scale and the size of the BLR into account, we tentatively propose that the changes in the measurement of the BLR size may be affected by “geometric dilution”

β Pictoris's well-studied debris disk and two known giant planets, in combination with the stability of the Hubble Space Telescope’s Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (HST/STIS) (and now also JWST), offers a unique opportunity to test planet–disk interaction models and to observe recent planetesimal collisions. We present HST/STIS coronagraphic imaging from two new epochs of data taken between 2021 and 2023, complementing earlier data taken in 1997 and 2012. This data set enables a temporal comparison with the longest baseline and highest precision of any debris disk to date, with sensitivity to variations in temporal surface brightness of sub-percent levels in the midplane of the disk. While no localized changes in surface brightness are detected, which would be indicative of a recent planetesimal collision, there is a tentative brightening of the southeast side of the disk over the past decade. We link the constraints on surface brightness variations to dynamical models of the planetary system’s evolution and to the collisional history of planetesimals. Using a coupled collisional model and injection/recovery framework, we estimate sensitivity to expanding collisional debris down to a Ceres mass per progenitor in the most sensitive regions of the disk midplane. These results demonstrate the capabilities of long-baseline, temporal studies with HST (and also soon with JWST) for constraining the physical processes occurring within debris disks.

总结:
WISEA J171419.96+602724.6是一个极其明亮的2型类星系，通过深度的NuSTAR和XMM-Newton观测发现，该源具有更低的遮挡，但通量减小了约四倍。两次观测表明，该源在不到2.5年的时间内在X射线遮挡、通量和固有光度方面发生了显著的变化。该源是一个红外超亮、受遮挡的星系，其托卢斯中有大量的热尘，并与热、被尘埋没的星系具有许多相似的特性。通过SED拟合发现，该源的辐射率很高，其宿主星系拥有巨大的恒星形成率和星族质量，这与高红移类星体的测量结果一致，并提示该目标的活跃核不会增强或抑制其宿主星系的恒星形成率。 <div>
We present a comprehensive X-ray analysis and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of WISEA J171419.96+602724.6, an extremely luminous type 2 quasar at z = 2.99. The source was suggested as a candidate Compton-thick (column density NH > 1.5×1024 cm−2) quasar by a short XMM-Newton observation in 2011. We recently observed the source with deep NuSTAR and XMM-Newton exposures in 2021 and found that the source has a lower obscuration of NH ∼ 5×1022 cm−2 with an about four times lower flux. The two epochs of observations suggested that the source was significantly variable in X-ray obscuration, flux, and intrinsic luminosity at 2σ–3σ in less than 2.5 yr (in the source rest frame). We performed SED fitting of this source using Code Investigating GALaxy Emission thanks to its great availability of multiwavelength data (from hard X-rays to radio). The source is very luminous, with a bolometric luminosity of LBOL ∼ 2.5 × 1047 erg s−1. Its host galaxy has a huge star formation rate (SFR) of ∼1280 M☉ yr−1 and a huge stellar mass of ∼1.1 × 1012M☉. The correlation between the SFR and stellar mass of this source is consistent with what was measured in the high-z quasars. It is also consistent with what was measured in the main-sequence star-forming galaxies, suggesting that the presence of the active nucleus in our target does not enhance or suppress the SFR of its host galaxy. The source is an infrared hyperluminous, obscured galaxy with a significant amount of hot dust in its torus and shares many similar properties with hot, dust-obscured galaxies.

总结:
太阳黑子和太阳周期间的关系进行了研究。研究表明，过渡期太阳黑子的总面积和总磁通量之间的关系在观测太阳周期的每个阶段似乎变得平坦，并且在太阳周期中没有明显的变化。对于三组太阳黑子，黑子物理参数的平均值及其相关性在太阳周期中只有轻微变化，处于误差范围内。随着平均黑子磁场强度的增加，黑子光强度与磁场强度的相关性也增加。总体而言，过渡期太阳黑子在总面积和总磁通量散点图上的变平与太阳黑子本身的演化有关，并且可能与太阳周期无关。黑子物理参数及其相关性在太阳周期中并没有明显的规律性，这些分析结果有助于更全面地理解太阳黑子磁场的动态过程，为揭示垂直磁通量管的物理特征提供了新的视角。 <div>
To reveal the physical properties of pores and sunspots varying with solar cycle, we carried out a statistical comparison among pores, transitional sunspots, and mature sunspots using Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager from 2010 April to 2023 July. The OTSU method and region-growing algorithm were combined to detect umbrae of 11,876 sunspots covering solar cycles 24 and 25. The relationships between umbral area, continuum intensity (I), line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic field strength (Blos), and line-of-sight velocity (Vlos) of umbrae were investigated in detail. The main conclusions are as follows. (1) The steepness between the total magnetic flux and total area of transitional sunspots appears to be flattened in each phase of the observed solar cycles, and does not have a significant variation over the solar cycle. (2) For three groups of sunspots, the umbral physical parameters’ means and their correlations show only minor variations with the solar cycle, which are in error ranges. (3) As the mean umbral LOS magnetic field strength increases, the correlation of the umbral I–Blos increases. The flattening of transitional sunspots in total area–total magnetic flux scatter is related to the evolution of sunspots itself, and may not correspond to the solar cycle. The umbral physical parameters and their correlations do not exhibit a discernible regularity over the solar cycle. Our analysis results contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamic processes of sunspot magnetic fields and give a new perspective on revealing the physical features of vertical magnetic flux tubes.

The shape of the cold interstellar molecular gas is determined by several processes, including self-gravity, tidal force, turbulence, magnetic field, and galactic shear. Based on the 3D dust extinction map derived by Vergely et al., we identify a sample of 550 molecular clouds within 3 kpc of the solar vicinity in the Galactic disk. Our sample contains clouds whose size ranges from parsec to kiloparsec, which enables us to study the effect of Galactic-scale processes, such as shear, on cloud evolution. We find that our sample clouds follow a power-law mass–size relation of , , and , where is the major axis-based cloud radius, RS is the area-based radius, and RV is the volume-based radius, respectively. These clouds have a mean constant surface density of ∼7 M⊙ pc−2 and follow a volume density–size relation of . As cloud size increases, their shapes gradually transition from ellipsoidal to disk-like to bar-like structures. Large clouds tend to have a pitch angle of 28°−45°, where the angle is measured concerning the Galactic tangential direction. These giant clouds also tend to stay parallel to the Galactic disk plane and are confined within the Galactic molecular gas disk. Our results show that large molecular clouds in the Milky Way can be shaped by Galactic shear and confined in the vertical direction by gravity.

We present a proof-of-concept simulation-based inference on Ωm and σ8 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) LOWZ Northern Galactic Cap (NGC) catalog using neural networks and domain generalization techniques without the need of summary statistics. Using rapid light-cone simulations L-picola, mock galaxy catalogs are produced that fully incorporate the observational effects. The collection of galaxies is fed as input to a point cloud-based network, Minkowski-PointNet. We also add relatively more accurate Gadget mocks to obtain robust and generalizable neural networks. By explicitly learning the representations that reduce the discrepancies between the two different data sets via the semantic alignment loss term, we show that the latent space configuration aligns into a single plane in which the two cosmological parameters form clear axes. Consequently, during inference, the SDSS BOSS LOWZ NGC catalog maps onto the plane, demonstrating effective generalization and improving prediction accuracy compared to non-generalized models. Results from the ensemble of 25 independently trained machines find Ωm = 0.339 ± 0.056 and σ8 = 0.801 ± 0.061, inferred only from the distribution of galaxies in the light-cone slices without relying on any indirect summary statistics. A single machine that best adapts to the Gadget mocks yields a tighter prediction of Ωm = 0.282 ± 0.014 and σ8 = 0.786 ± 0.036. We emphasize that adaptation across multiple domains can enhance the robustness of the neural networks in observational data.

<div> 关键词: 21 cm实验宇宙学, 射电望远镜, 计算电磁学模拟, MEDEA模拟器, 光束超参数

总结: 
21 cm实验宇宙学中，准确表征射电望远镜的天线光束响应对于测量21 cm信号至关重要。为了优化天线设计或准确表示光束，需要进行光束模式和频率响应的计算电磁学模拟。然而，搜索所有可能的参数空间以优化天线设计或准确代表光束是计算上昂贵的。因此，研究人员提出了MEDEA模拟器，它能够快速而准确地在广阔的超参数空间内生成远场辐射模式。MEDEA采用CEM软件模拟的一部分光束，将其空间分解成完整的线性基础上的系数，然后插值形成任意超参数的新光束。研究人员对一个解析偶极子和两个数字光束进行测试，并将MEDEA作为模型用于拟合模拟射电分光计数据以提取输入光束超参数的协方差。他们发现，利用20个或更少的输入光束，插值光束的均方根相对误差最多为10^-2，并且拟合模拟数据能够恢复输入光束超参数。当在模拟数据中引入系统偏差时，提取的光束超参数会出现偏差，这是预期的。他们提出了MEDEA的一些扩展来解决这种偏差。 <div>
In 21 cm experimental cosmology, accurate characterization of a radio telescope’s antenna beam response is essential to measure the 21 cm signal. Computational electromagnetic (CEM) simulations estimate the antenna beam pattern and frequency response by subjecting the EM model to different dependencies, or beam hyperparameters, such as soil dielectric constant or orientation with the environment. However, it is computationally expensive to search all possible parameter spaces to optimize the antenna design or accurately represent the beam to the level required for use as a systematic model in 21 cm cosmology. We therefore present the Model for Emulating Directivities and Electric fields of Antennas (MEDEA), an emulator that rapidly and accurately generates far-field radiation patterns over a large hyperparameter space. MEDEA takes a subset of beams simulated by CEM software, spatially decomposes them into coefficients on a complete, linear basis, and then interpolates them to form new beams at arbitrary hyperparameters. We test MEDEA on an analytical dipole and two numerical beams motivated by upcoming lunar lander missions, and then employ MEDEA as a model to fit mock radio spectrometer data to extract covariances on the input beam hyperparameters. We find that the interpolated beams have rms relative errors of at most 10−2 using 20 input beams or less, and that fits to mock data are able to recover the input beam hyperparameters when the model and mock are derived from the same set of beams. When a systematic bias is introduced into the mock data, extracted beam hyperparameters exhibit bias, as expected. We propose several extensions to MEDEA to potentially account for such bias.

<title>Windy or Not: Radio Parsec-scale Evidence for a Broad-line Region Wind in Radio-quiet Quasars</title>

总结:<br /><br />这项研究探讨了RQ活动星系核中的广谱线区域（BLR）风是否延伸到秒差距尺度并产生无线电发射。研究发现具有无线电和BLR风指标的对象在高Eddington比率（L/LEdd≥0.66）处，并且大部分既没有无线电也没有BLR风指标的对象处于低Eddington比率（L/LEdd≤0.28）处。这表明RQ AGN中的BLR风和无线电风与辐射压力驱动的风有关。研究还发现两个对象中存在AGN光电离气体的自由–自由吸收迹象，三个低Eddington比率（0.05–0.12）对象的无线电流出可能来自低功率喷流，四个中等Eddington比率（0.2–0.4）对象中存在温和的赤道BLR风。未来的光谱偏振测量可以验证这一点。 <div>
Does a broad-line region (BLR) wind in radio-quiet (RQ) active galactic nuclei (AGN) extend to parsec scales and produce radio emission? We explore the correlations between a parsec-scale radio wind and the BLR wind in a sample of 19 RQ Palomar–Green quasars. The radio wind is defined based on the spectral slope and the compactness of the emission at 1.5–5 GHz, and the BLR wind is defined by the excess blue wing in the C iv emission line profile. The five objects with both radio and BLR wind indicators are found at high Eddington ratios, L/LEdd (≥0.66), and eight of the nine objects with neither radio nor BLR winds reside at low L/LEdd (≤0.28). This suggests that the BLR wind and the radio wind in RQ AGN are related to a radiation-pressure-driven wind. Evidence for free–free absorption by AGN photoionized gas, which flattens the spectral slope, is found in two objects. Radio outflows in three low-L/LEdd (0.05–0.12) objects are likely from a low-power jet, as suggested by additional evidence. The presence of a mild equatorial BLR wind in four intermediate-L/LEdd (0.2–0.4) objects can be tested with future spectropolarimetry.

<div> 搜索、脉冲星候选、银河系、MeerKAT射电望远镜、偏振
总结:
本研究利用MeerKAT射电望远镜的图像进行了对银河系中心区域的脉冲星候选的搜索，使用了多种标准来选择候选脉冲星。结果显示出75个偏振源，其中28个和明亮恒星或年轻恒星对象相关。对已知脉冲星进行偏振发射的搜索结果表明了这一技术的有效性。通过比较这些候选源的属性，确定了30个有希望进行脉冲星脉冲跟踪的候选源。有两个源同时具有较强的圆偏振和线偏振。剩下的17个源可能是脉冲星或恒星，但也不能排除是星系外来源或图像伪迹的可能。 <div>
We report on the results of an image-based search for pulsar candidates toward the Galactic bulge. We used mosaic images from the MeerKAT radio telescope that were taken as part of a 173 deg2 survey of the bulge and Galactic center of our Galaxy at L band (856–1712 MHz) in all four Stokes I, Q, U, and V. The image rms noise levels of 12–17 μJy ba−1 represent a significant increase in sensitivity over past image-based pulsar searches. Our primary search criterion was circular polarization, but we used other criteria, including linear polarization, in-band spectral index, compactness, variability, and multiwavelength counterparts to select pulsar candidates. We first demonstrate the efficacy of this technique by searching for polarized emission from known pulsars and comparing our results with measurements from the literature. Our search resulted in a sample of 75 polarized sources. Bright stars or young stellar objects were associated with 28 of these sources, including a small sample of highly polarized dwarf stars with pulsar-like steep spectra. Comparing the properties of this sample with the known pulsars, we identified 30 compelling candidates for pulsation follow-up, including two sources with both strong circular and linear polarization. The remaining 17 sources are either pulsars or stars, but we cannot rule out an extragalactic origin or image artifacts among the brighter, flat-spectrum objects.

<div> 关键词: 非热展宽, 磁场, 视线, 运动, 太阳光谱
总结: 
本文通过观察太阳活跃区的Si iv 1403 Å光谱，发现非热展宽与磁场与观察者视线方向的对齐有关，并且与向下运动（红移）呈正相关。根据这些观察结果，作者推测磁场方向与观察者视线方向一致时，沿着磁场下流的等离子体速度梯度可能导致闭合场区域中过渡区光谱线的非热展宽。这一发现有助于解答太阳光谱中非热展宽的物理过程。 <div>
The origin of nonthermal broadening in solar spectra is one of the long-standing questions in solar physics. Various processes have been invoked—including unresolved flows, waves, and turbulent processes—but definitive answers are lacking. To investigate the physical processes responsible for nonthermal broadening, we examine its relation with the angle between the magnetic field and the line of sight in three different closed-field regions above plage regions at different locations on the solar disk. We obtained the nonthermal width of transition-region Si iv 1403 Å spectra observed in active regions by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, after subtraction of the thermal and instrumental line broadening. To investigate the dependence of the measured broadening on the viewing angle between the line of sight and magnetic field direction, we determined the magnetic field direction at transition-region heights using nonlinear force-free extrapolations based on the observed photospheric vector magnetic field taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. We found that the nonthermal broadening shows a correlation with downward motion (redshifts) and alignment between the magnetic field and the observer’s line-of-sight direction. Based on the observed correlations, we suggest that velocity gradients within plasma flowing down along the magnetic field may lead to a significant portion of the observed nonthermal broadening of transition-region spectral lines in closed fields above plage regions.

Large area observations of extragalactic deep fields with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have provided a wealth of candidate low-mass L- and T-class brown dwarfs. The existence of these sources, which are at derived distances of hundreds of parsecs to several kiloparsecs from the Sun, has strong implications for the low-mass end of the stellar initial mass function, and the link between stars and planets at low metallicities. In this letter, we present a JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectrum of brown dwarf JADES-GS-BD-9, confirming its photometric selection from observations taken as part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program. Fits to this spectrum indicate that the brown dwarf has an effective temperature of 800–900 K (T5–T6) at a distance of 1.8–2.3 kpc from the Sun, with evidence of the source being at low metallicity ([M/H] ≤ −0.5). Finally, because of the cadence of JADES NIRCam observations of this source, we additionally uncover a proper motion between the 2022 and 2023 centroids, and we measure a proper motion of 20 ± 4 mas yr−1 (a transverse velocity of 214 km s−1 at 2.25 kpc). At this predicted metallicity, distance, and transverse velocity, it is likely that this source belongs either to the edge of the Milky Way thick disk or the galactic halo. This spectral confirmation demonstrates the efficacy of photometric selection of these important sources across deep extragalactic JWST imaging.

总结: 最近的研究表明，来自相对论等离子体的同步辐射会导致电子分布在动量空间中形成一个各向异性的环状结构，并且容易受到动力学和流体不稳定性的影响。本文研究了等离子体光学厚度增加时这些不稳定性的行为。我们将最近发展的用于轻度相对论等离子体中同步辐射和吸收的Fokker–Planck算子推广到了超相对论等离子体。对于给定的等离子体参数，由高能电子发射的光子往往具有更高的频率，因此更容易逃离等离子体。因此，对于给定的电子来说，光子发射率（辐射阻力）与吸收率（辐射扩散）的比率极大地依赖于能量。考虑到这种行为，我们确定了控制光学厚度的临界参数，并展示了等离子体如何在更高的光学厚度下逐渐过渡为更各向同性和更稳定的状态。 <div>
Recent work has shown that synchrotron emission from relativistic plasmas leads the electron distribution to form an anisotropic ring in momentum space, which can be unstable to both kinetic and hydrodynamic instabilities. Fundamental to these works was the assumption that the plasma was optically thin, allowing all emitted radiation to escape. Here, we examine the behavior of these instabilities as the plasma becomes more optically thick. To do this, we extend a recently developed Fokker–Planck operator for synchrotron emission and absorption in mildly relativistic plasmas to ultrarelativistic plasmas. For a given set of plasma parameters, photons emitted by higher-energy electrons tend to be higher frequency, and thus more easily escape the plasma. As a result, the ratio of the photon emission rate (radiative drag) to absorption rate (radiative diffusion) for a given electron is extremely energy dependent. Given this behavior, we determine the critical parameters that control the opacity, and show how the plasma gradually transitions to become more isotropic and stable at higher opacity.

Recent works have constrained the binary fraction of evolved populations of massive stars in local galaxies such as red supergiants and Wolf–Rayet stars, but the binary fraction of yellow supergiants (YSGs) in the Hertzsprung gap remains unconstrained. Binary evolution theory predicts that the Hertzsprung gap is home to multiple populations of binary systems with varied evolutionary histories. In this paper, we develop a method to distinguish single YSGs from YSG plus O- or B-type main-sequence binaries using optical and ultraviolet photometry, and then apply this method to identify candidate YSG binaries in the Magellanic Clouds. After constructing a set of combined stellar atmosphere models, we find that optical photometry is, given typical measurement and reddening uncertainties, sufficient to discern single YSGs from YSG+OB binaries if the OB-star is at least ∼5M⊙ for Teff,YSG ∼ 4000 K, but requires a ∼20M⊙ OB star for YSGs up to Teff,YSG ∼ 9000 K. For these hotter YSG temperatures, ultraviolet photometry allows binaries with OB companions as small as ∼7M⊙ to be identified. We use color–color spaces developed from these models to search for evidence of excess blue or ultraviolet light in a set of ∼1000 YSG candidates in the Magellanic Clouds. We identify hundreds of candidate YSG binary systems and report a preliminary fraction of YSGs that show a blue/UV color excess of 20%–60%. Spectroscopic follow-up is now required to confirm the true nature of this population.

Previous studies have revealed that the Galactic warp is a long-lived, nonsteady, and asymmetric structure. There is a need for a model that accounts for the warp’s long-term evolution. Given that this structure has persisted for over 5 Gyr, its timeline may coincide with the completion of the Gaia–Sausage–Enceladus (GSE) merger. Recent studies indicate that the GSE, the significant merger of our Galaxy, was likely a gas-rich merger and the large amount of gas introduced could have created a profound impact on the Galactic morphology. This study utilizes GIZMO simulation code to construct a gas-rich GSE merger. By reconstructing the observed characteristics of the GSE, we successfully reproduce the disk warp and capture nearly all of its documented features, which align closely with observational data from both stellar and gas disks. This simulation demonstrates the possibility that a single major merger could generate the Galactic warp amplitude and precession. Furthermore, the analysis of the warp’s long-term evolution may offer more clues into the formation history of the Milky Way.

The origin of water and volatile compounds on planets including Earth is a hotly debated topic in planetary science. For example, many dynamic models suggest that the majority of Earth’s water and volatile elements were added from an external source. The stellar wind irradiation of rocky oxygen-containing minerals results in a reaction between H+ ions and silicate minerals to produce water and OH, which could explain the presence of water in the regoliths of airless worlds such as the Moon, as well as the water abundances in asteroids. Here, we used the method of high-resolution infrared spectrometry and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) with mass detection to observe and for the first time quantify water formation on the surfaces of oxygen-bearing minerals. We tested 14 different mineral and natural samples and observed the formation of water on their surfaces upon exposure to H+ or D+ irradiation. The samples, including two meteorite samples (RAS 445 and SAU 567), were shown to have a water adsorption capacity between 0.09 and 0.7 wt%. The adsorbed water (likely dissociatively adsorbed) remains on the surface at pressures as low as 10−9 mbar (in the TPD experiment) and temperatures as high as 600 K, which suggests a possible transfer over long distances and timescales. Our article has a general character and demonstrates that any interaction of oxygen-containing minerals with stellar radiation (H+ ions) leads to the generation of water adsorbed on the surface of the minerals. The case of the origin of water on Earth is taken as a prime example.

We present the results from the NICER observation data of MAXI J1803−298 across the entire 2021 outburst. In the intermediate and soft state, we detect significant absorption lines at ∼7.0 and ∼6.7 keV, arising from X-ray disk winds outflowing with a velocity of hundreds of km s−1 along our line of sight. The fitting results from the photoionized model suggest that the winds are driven by thermal pressure and the mass-loss rate is low. We find a clear transition for iron from predominantly H-like to predominantly He-like during the intermediate-to-soft state transition. Our results indicate this transition for iron is caused by the evolution of the illuminating spectrum and the slow change of the geometric properties of the disk winds together. The coexistence of disk winds and quasiperiodic oscillation features in the intermediate state is also reported. Our study makes MAXI J1803−298 the first source in which a transition from optical winds to X-ray winds is detected, offering new insights into the evolution of disk winds across an entire outburst and long-term coupling of accretion disks and mass outflows around accreting black holes.

The present study has investigated the statistical distribution of the current sheet width across the reconnection diffusion region by means of the 3D particle-in-cell simulations. The 3D reconnection layers are unstable to the flow shear instabilities, which results in electromagnetic (EM) turbulence generating effective magnetic dissipation around the x-line. The simulations are performed for several ion-to-electron mass ratios and computational domain sizes, which determine the fastest-growing mode in each simulation run. When the turbulence is weak, the current sheet width increases with the turbulence intensity, following a theoretical curve independent of the mass ratio and domain size. However, when the turbulence is stronger, the width saturates at a low level around 2 times the local electron inertia length, i.e., much smaller than the ion kinetic scales. It is found that the intense inductive electric field due to the EM turbulence is partly canceled out by the eddy viscous effect. As a result, the reconnection electric field is almost unchanged during the quasi-steady phase, regardless of the turbulence intensity. The result implies that the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence models are unlikely to be applicable to the reconnection diffusion region.

<div> 关键词: 外行星大气检索, 假设, 水汽剖面, 云, 观测数据

总结: 本研究利用先进的检索框架探讨了假设外行星大气中垂直分子丰度恒定和无云层对外行星性质表征的影响。首先在模拟的地球1D中红外光谱上验证了不同的检索模型，然后对真实的地球中红外光谱进行了分析。研究发现，对H2O丰度和云层的假设直接影响对地球特征的提取。根据观测数据，使用物理合理的H2O剖面和云模型进行的检索效果更佳，能够准确估计地球的半径、压力-温度结构以及CO2、H2O和O3的丰度，并且在R = 100时，可以可靠且无偏倚地检测CH4等生物标志物。因此，本研究建议在温带外行星大气的检索中使用多样的模型，以建立对不同检索假设对外行星光谱解释的影响的理解，从而能够利用未来的空间仪器对遥远的宜居世界进行表征和寻找生命。 <br /><br /> <div>
Atmospheric retrievals are widely used to constrain exoplanet properties from observed spectra. We investigate how the common nonphysical retrieval assumptions of vertically constant molecule abundances and cloud-free atmospheres affect our characterization of an exo-Earth (an Earth-twin orbiting a Sun-like star). Specifically, we use a state-of-the-art retrieval framework to explore how assumptions for the H2O profile and clouds affect retrievals. In the first step, we validate different retrieval models on a low-noise simulated 1D mid-infrared (MIR) spectrum of Earth. Thereafter, we study how these assumptions affect the characterization of Earth with the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE). We run retrievals on LIFE mock observations based on real disk-integrated MIR Earth spectra. The performance of different retrieval models is benchmarked against ground truths derived from remote sensing data. We show that assumptions for the H2O abundance and clouds directly affect our characterization. Overall, retrievals that use physically motivated models for the H2O profile and clouds perform better on the empirical Earth data. For observations of Earth with LIFE, they yield accurate estimates for the radius, pressure–temperature structure, and the abundances of CO2, H2O, and O3. Further, at R = 100, a reliable and bias-free detection of the biosignature CH4 becomes feasible. We conclude that the community must use a diverse range of models for temperate exoplanet atmospheres to build an understanding of how different retrieval assumptions can affect the interpretation of exoplanet spectra. This will enable the characterization of distant habitable worlds and the search for life with future space-based instruments.

<div> MaNGA, resolved spectroscopy, galaxies, star formation, quenched regions
<br /><br />总结:
该研究利用MaNGA的解析光谱对银河系的局部和整体性质进行了调查，以探究kpc尺度上星体形成停止的重要性。研究通过一个单参数标准Dn(4000) - EW(Hα)来识别隔离的盘状星系中的停星区域，并根据冷气体表面密度Σgas将其划分为富气体停星区域（GRQRs）和贫气体停星区域。这两种类型的停星区域往往位于非AGN星系中，具有相对较高的质量（M* ≳ 1010 M⊙）和红色（NUV − r ≳ 3），以及低的星体形成率和固定质量时的高中心密度。他们在其他性质上的范围很广，包括结构参数，与母样本相似，表明导致富气体区域停星的条件在很大程度上独立于星系的整体性质。我们对我们的样本进行了随机森林分类器和回归器的训练，用于预测在15个局部/整体性质中的停星现象。Σ*是停星的最重要性质，尤其是对于GRQRs来说。这些结果强烈表明了低质量的热演化星体的重要作用，这些星体在停星区域中数量众多且寿命长，可以给周围气体提供实质的辐射压力，来抵制重力坍缩。以前A.F.L.Bluck等人发现的停星的不同功能重要性，在一定程度上是由于对停星区域的不同定义，特别是对EW(Hα)的不同要求。 <div>
We use resolved spectroscopy from MaNGA to investigate the significance of both local and global properties of galaxies to the cessation of star formation at kpc scales. Quenched regions are identified from a sample of isolated disk galaxies by a single-parameter criterion Dn(4000) - EW(Hα) , and are divided into gas-rich quenched regions (GRQRs) and gas-poor quenched regions according to the surface density of cold gas (Σgas). Both types of quenched regions tend to be hosted by non-AGN galaxies with relatively high mass (M* ≳ 1010 M⊙) and red colors (NUV − r ≳ 3), as well as low star formation rate and high central density at fixed mass. They span wide ranges in other properties including structural parameters that are similar to the parent sample, indicating that the conditions responsible for quenching in gas-rich regions are largely independent of the global properties of galaxies. We train random forest classifiers and regressors for predicting quenching in our sample with 15 local/global properties. Σ* is the most important property for quenching, especially for GRQRs. These results strongly indicate the important roles of low-mass hot evolved stars, which are numerous and long-lived in quenched regions and can provide substantial radiation pressure to support the surrounding gas against gravitational collapse. The different feature importance for quenching, as found previously by A. F. L. Bluck et al., is partly due to the different definitions of quenched regions, particularly the different requirements on EW(Hα).

总结: 
在现代长基线干涉仪收集的数据中搜索连续波引力辐射需要大量的存储空间。该论文描述了一种数字化方案，将64位干涉仪输出减少到一个或两个比特的数据流，同时最小化失真，并实现存储和输入/输出成本的大幅降低。对于代表性的最大似然匹配滤波器，通过蒙特卡洛模拟发现，在高斯噪声中，注入信号仅需要比64位信号强约24%（对于一比特数据）和强约6.4%（对于具有最佳门限的两比特数据）即可以90%的概率被检测到。当信号频率逐渐降低或噪声统计不是高斯时，上述百分比几乎不会发生显著变化，在LIGO第六次科学运行数据的验证中也得到了证实。 <div>
Searches for continuous-wave gravitational radiation in data collected by modern long-baseline interferometers, such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), the Virgo interferometer, and the Kamioka Gravitational Wave Detector, can be memory intensive. A digitization scheme is described that reduces the 64-bit interferometer output to a one- or two-bit data stream while minimizing distortion and achieving considerable reduction in storage and input/output cost. For the representative example of the coherent, maximum-likelihood matched filter known as the -statistic, it is found using Monte Carlo simulations that the injected signal only needs to be ≈24% stronger (for one-bit data) and ≈6.4% stronger (for two-bit data with optimal thresholds) than a 64-bit signal in order to be detected with 90% probability in Gaussian noise. The foregoing percentages do not change significantly when the signal frequency decreases secularly, or when the noise statistics are not Gaussian, as verified with LIGO Science Run 6 data.

<div> 关键词: 高能宇宙射线电子、能量损失率、红移、气体表面密度、高红移星系<br />
总结: 本研究建立了一个简单的参数模型来描述无线电和红外辐射之间的相关性，考虑了高能宇宙射线电子的能量损失率，包括辐射冷却、电离和绝热膨胀等过程。对每个能量损失过程进行了计算和比较，将每个过程的能量损失率重新写成与气体表面密度和红移的相关比列关系。通过结合每个能量损失率，计算了辐射冷却的能量损失率在气体表面密度和红移上的比例，将局部建立的qIR值重新表达为与红移和气体表面密度相关，并应用于理解I. Delvecchio等人研究中高红移星系的观察到的无线电-红外相关性分布。我们的模型预测，qIR值与气体表面密度呈反相关，并且qIR值的红移依赖性受到星系气体表面密度的影响，捕捉了以恒星质量为选择标准的星形成星系的qIR值观测趋势，减少了无线电-红外选择偏差的影响。<br /><br /> <div>
We introduce a simple parametric model of the radio–infrared correlation (i.e., the ratio between the IR luminosity and the 1.4 GHz radio luminosity, qIR) by considering the energy loss rate of high-energy cosmic-ray (CR) electrons governed by radiative cooling (synchrotron, bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton scattering), ionization, and adiabatic expansion. Each process of CR electron energy loss is explicitly computed and compared to each other. We rewrite the energy loss rate of each process to be dependent on the gas surface density and redshift using the relevant scaling relations. By combining each energy loss rate, the fraction of the synchrotron energy loss rate is computed as a function of gas surface density and redshift and used to extrapolate the well-established “local” radio–infrared correlation to the high-redshift Universe. The locally established qIR is reformulated to be dependent upon the redshift and the gas surface density and applied for understanding the observed distribution of the radio–infrared correlation of high-redshift galaxies in I. Delvecchio et al. Our model predicts that the qIR value is anticorrelated with gas surface density and the redshift dependency of the qIR value changes by the gas surface density of galaxies, which captures the observed trend of qIR values for stellar-mass-selected star-forming galaxies with a minimal impact of radio–infrared selection bias.

<div> 关键词: 外行星, 大气成分, 行星参数, 岩浆, 化学平衡
总结:<br /><br />这项研究考察了外行星大气中氢、氧和碳的依赖关系，并基于行星参数和岩浆特性进行了分析。研究结果表明，在类地行星的全熔岩石内部，大气中H2O的分数约为10^(-2)-10^(-1)，而C/H则仅在大气压力≲1000 bar和H2O分数≳10%时才会略微增加。此外，在氧化大气条件下，C/O比会下降到nebula气体值的十分之一以下，可能为岩石内部和内源水提供了证据。研究还强调了对高压物质特性的约束对解释膨胀行星的岩浆-大气相互作用的重要性。 <div>
Most exoplanets with a few Earth radii are more inflated than bare-rock planets with the same mass, indicating a substantial volatile amount. Neither the origin of the volatiles nor the planet’s bulk composition can be constrained from the mass–radius relation alone, and the spectral characterization of their atmospheres is needed to solve this degeneracy. Previous studies showed that chemical interaction between accreted volatile and possible molten rocky surface (i.e., magma ocean) can greatly affect the atmospheric composition. However, a variety in the atmospheric compositions of such planets with different properties remains elusive. In this work, we examine the dependence of atmospheric H, O, and C on planetary parameters (atmospheric thickness, planetary mass, equilibrium temperature, and magma properties such as redox state) assuming nebula gas accretion on an Earth-like core, using an atmosphere-magma chemical equilibrium model. Consistent with previous work, we show that atmospheric H2O fraction on a fully molten rocky interior with an Earth-like redox state is on the order of 10−2–10−1 regardless of other planetary parameters. Despite the solubility difference between H- and C-bearing species, C/H increases only a few times above the nebula value except for atmospheric pressure ≲1000 bar and H2O fraction ≳10%. This results in a negative O/H–C/O trend and depleted C/O below one-tenth of the nebula gas value under an oxidized atmosphere, which could provide a piece of evidence of rocky interior and endogenic water. We also highlight the importance of constraints on the high-pressure material properties for interpreting the magma–atmospheric interaction of inflated planets.

In this paper, we calculate the energy, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), detection range, and angular anisotropy of the matter, matter memory, and neutrino memory gravitational-wave (GW) signatures of 21 three-dimensional initially nonrotating core-collapse supernova (CCSN) models carried to late times. We find that inferred energy, SNR, and detection range are angle-dependent quantities, and that the spread of possible energy, signal to noise, and detection ranges across all viewing angles generally increases with progenitor mass. When examining the low-frequency matter memory and neutrino memory components of the signal, we find that the neutrino memory is the most detectable component of a CCSN GW signal, and that DECIGO is best equipped to detect both matter memory and neutrino memory. Moreover, we find that the polarization angle between the h+ and h× strains serves as a unique identifier of matter and neutrino memory. Finally, we develop a Galactic density- and stellar mass-weighted formalism to calculate the rate at which we can expect to detect CCSN GW signals with the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (aLIGO). When considering only the matter component of the signal, the aLIGO detection rate is around 65% of the total Galactic supernova rate, but increases to 90% when incorporating the neutrino memory component. We find that all future detectors (Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer, DECIGO) will be able to detect CCSN GW signals from the entire Galaxy, and for the higher-mass progenitors even into the Local Group of galaxies.

The stellar shells surrounding an elliptical galaxy, as remnants of a dwarf galaxy disrupted during merging, reveal the distribution of energy and angular momentum of the progenitor dwarf galaxy. We develop a semi-analytical model to describe the changes in energy ΔEi and angular momentum ΔLzi for particles during the first infall. We show that these changes, induced by the self-gravity of the progenitor, are important in broadening the initial energy distribution of the Plummer or Hernquist progenitor model. Consequently, these changes are crucial in shaping the shells. In the freefall stage following the disintegration of the progenitor potential, particles are no longer bound by self-gravity but move within the gravitational potential of the target galaxy. We investigate the relationship between the radial period and the energy of particles undergoing radial motion. We show that an accurate model of the energy range of the dwarf galaxy at disruption is essential to predict the number of observable shells.

Oscillatory reconnection is a specific type of time-dependent reconnection which involves periodic changes in the magnetic topology of a null point. The mechanism has been reported for a variety of magnetic field strengths and configurations, background temperatures, and densities. All these studies report an oscillation in the current density at the null point, but also report a variety of periods, amplitudes, and overall behaviors. We conduct a parametric study for equilibrium magnetic field strength and initial background temperature, solving two-dimensional resistive magnetohydrodynamic equations around a magnetic X-point. We introduce a parameter space for the ratio of internal to magnetic energy and find self-similar solutions for simulations where this ratio is below 0.1 (which represents a magnetically dominated environment or, equivalently, a low-beta plasma). Self-similarity can be seen in oscillations in the current density at the null (including amplitude and period), ohmic heating, and the temperature generated via reconnection jets. The parameter space of energy ratios also allows us to contextualize previous studies of the oscillatory reconnection mechanism and bring those different studies together into a single unified understanding.

Due to the unprecedented signal strengths offered by the newest high-resolution spectrographs on 10 m class telescopes, exploring the 3D nature of exoplanets is possible with an unprecedented level of precision. In this paper, we present a new technique to probe the vertical structure of exoplanetary winds and dynamics using ensembles of planet absorption lines of varying opacity, and apply it to the well-studied ultrahot Jupiter WASP-76b. We then compare these results to state-of-the-art global circulation models (GCMs) with varying magnetic drag prescriptions. We find that the known asymmetric velocity shift in Fe i absorption during transit persists at all altitudes, and observe tentative trends for stronger blueshifts and more narrow line profiles deeper in the atmosphere. By comparing three different model prescriptions (a hydrodynamical model with no drag, a magnetic drag model, and a uniform drag model) we are able to rule out the uniform drag model due to inconsistencies with observed trends in the data. We find that the magnetic model is slightly favored over the the hydrodynamic model, and note that this 3-Gauss kinematic magnetohydrodynamical GCM is also favored when compared to low-resolution data. Future generation high-resolution spectrographs on extremely large telescopes will greatly increase signals and make methods like these possible with higher precision and for a wider range of objects.

The need for real-time monitoring and alerting systems for space weather hazards has grown significantly in the last two decades. One of the most important challenges for space mission operations and planning is the prediction of solar proton events (SPEs). In this context, artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques have opened a new frontier, providing a new paradigm for statistical forecasting algorithms. The great majority of these models aim to predict the occurrence of an SPE, i.e., they are based on the classification approach. This work is oriented toward the successful implementation of onboard prediction systems, which is essential for the future of space exploration. We present a simple and efficient machine learning regression algorithm that is able to forecast the energetic proton flux up to 1 hr ahead by exploiting features derived from the electron flux only. This approach could be helpful in improving monitoring systems of the radiation risk in both deep space and near-Earth environments. The model is very relevant for mission operations and planning, especially when flare characteristics and source location are not available in real time, as at Mars distance.

研究利用500米口径球面射电望远镜观测数据成功识别了PSR B1822−09的不同脉冲轮廓组件的子组件，并通过单脉冲强度序列的相位-相位交叉相关确定子组件的数量和边缘。研究结果表明，PSR B1822−09的主脉冲（MP）、前驱（PC）和间脉冲（IP）都由三个子组件组成。强烈的子组件之间的正相关表明存在脉冲星表面不同区域的响应，并提出了不同子组件对应于脉冲星表面不同区域的假设。这些复杂的相关关系对描述不同脉冲轮廓组件之间关系的现有理论提出了挑战。 <div>
Using observational data obtained with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, we succeeded in identifying subcomponents of different pulse profile components of PSR B1822−09 by the phase-to-phase cross correlations between intensity sequences of single pulses. The determined number of the subcomponents and edges of the subcomponents are consistent with the results of Gaussian fitting on the mean pulse profiles of PSR B1822−09. According to the results, the main pulse (MP) in both the radio burst mode (B mode) and the radio-quiet mode (Q mode), the precursor (PC), and the interpulse (IP) of PSR B1822−09 are all composed of three subcomponents. The correlation coefficients between intensity sequences at different pulse phases reveal a positive correlation between the subcomponent C8 of the MP and C3 of the IP in the Q mode, and a positive correlation between C5 of the PC and C2 of the IP during the switching process from the B mode to the Q mode. These complex correlations present a challenge for the existing scenarios that describe relations between different pulse profile components. We proposed a hypothesis that different subcomponents correspond to different subpatches on the pulsar surface, and emissions from a subpatch reveal responses of the subpatch to some variations like the voltage in the magnetosphere. Therefore, correlations between different subcomponents depend on the responses of the subpatches to the variations.

<div> 光变曲线，差分图像，场景建模，超新星，宇宙学质量
<br /><br />总结:  这篇文章介绍了DARK ENERGY SURVEY SUPERNOVA（DES-SN）项目的光度学光变曲线，内容包括了在调查期间采用的差分图像上的强制点扩散函数光度测定和调查后处理的搜寻图像上的场景模拟光度测定。研究结果显示，采用场景模拟光度测定的精度、准确性和对宿主星系表面亮度异常的敏感度都更好。公开的光变曲线和辅助数据可在github.com/des-science/DES-SN5YR 和 doi:10.5281/zenodo.12720777 获取。 <div>
We present griz photometric light curves for the full 5 yr of the Dark Energy Survey Supernova (DES-SN) program, obtained with both forced point-spread function photometry on difference images (DiffImg) performed during survey operations, and scene modelling photometry (SMP) on search images processed after the survey. This release contains 31,636 DiffImg and 19,706 high-quality SMP light curves, the latter of which contain 1635 photometrically classified SNe that pass cosmology quality cuts. This sample spans the largest redshift (z) range ever covered by a single SN survey (0.1 < z < 1.13) and is the largest single sample from a single instrument of SNe ever used for cosmological constraints. We describe in detail the improvements made to obtain the final DES-SN photometry and provide a comparison to what was used in the 3 yr DES-SN spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia SN sample. We also include a comparative analysis of the performance of the SMP photometry with respect to the real-time DiffImg forced photometry and find that SMP photometry is more precise, more accurate, and less sensitive to the host-galaxy surface brightness anomaly. The public release of the light curves and ancillary data can be found at github.com/des-science/DES-SN5YR and doi:10.5281/zenodo.12720777.

<div> blazars, active galactic nuclei, UV flux variability, FSRQs, BL Lacertae objects

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了对10个类星体（包括两个平谱射电类星体（FSRQs）和八个BL Lacertae目标（BL Lacs））进行了紫外通量变化的研究。研究发现其中九个类星体在短时间尺度上（小时级别）存在紫外通量的变化，并且发现在这些类星体中，紫外光谱的变化表现出亮时更蓝的趋势。通过观察分析得出，这些类星体的紫外辐射主要由喷流同步辐射的过程主导。整体来看，在研究对象中的FSRQs和BL Lacs在紫外光谱的变化行为上没有明显差异。 <div>
Blazars, the peculiar class of active galactic nuclei, are known to show flux variations across the accessible electromagnetic spectrum. Though they have been studied extensively for their flux variability characteristics across wavelengths, information on their ultraviolet (UV) flux variations on timescales of hours is very limited. Here, we present the first UV flux variability study on intraday timescales of a sample of ten blazars comprising two flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and eight BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs). These objects, spanning a redshift (z) range of 0.034 ≤ z ≤ 1.003, were observed in the far-UV (1300−1800 Å) and near-UV (2000−3000 Å) wavebands using the ultraviolet imaging telescope on board AstroSat. UV flux variations on timescales of hours were detected in nine sources out of the observed ten blazars. The spectral variability analysis showed a bluer-when-brighter trend with no difference in the UV spectral variability behavior between the studied sample of FSRQs and BL Lacs. The observed UV flux and spectral variability in our sample of both FSRQs and BL Lacs revealed that the observed UV emission in them is dominated by jet synchrotron process.

<div> 关键词: 4U 1630–472, Insight-HXMT, 黑洞X射线暂现双星, 软态, 热力学特性

总结:
使用Insight-HXMT观测，研究了黑洞X射线暂现双星4U 1630–472在2022和2023年的爆发过程中的光谱特性，发现出现了不寻常的软态。通过kerrbb模型考虑硬化因子对盘温度的影响，发现盘的流量和温度分别与时间呈线性关系。通过p-free模型拟合发现，径向依赖性指数p值与盘温度呈反相关关系。结合非热分数和光度的关系图，发现盘从2022年到2023年可能向辐射效率降低的丰满盘演变，这种演变可能取决于高软态中非热辐射的分数。 <br /><br /> <div>
We study the spectral properties of the black hole X-ray transient binary 4U 1630–472 during its 2022 and 2023 outbursts with Insight-HXMT observations. We find that the outbursts are in peculiar soft states. The effect of the hardening factor on the disk temperature is taken into account by the kerrbb model, and the flux and temperature of the disk are found to follow and for the two outbursts, respectively. The flux–temperature relation is roughly consistent with a standard disk. By fitting with a p-free model, the p-value, the exponent of the radial dependence of the disk temperature, is found to have an anticorrelation with disk temperature. Combining a joint diagnostic analysis with a diagram of the relation between the nonthermal fraction and luminosity, we find a possible scenario that the disk evolves from 2022 to 2023 toward a slim one with a decreasing radiation efficiency, where such an evolution may depend on the fraction of the nonthermal emission in the high soft state.

<div> 太阳色球加热，等离子体流出，波的贡献，数值实验，离子-中性碰撞

总结:<br /><br />这篇论文提供了一个新的关于太阳色球加热和等离子体流出的视角，重点关注太阳颗粒运动产生的波的贡献。通过2.5D数值实验，研究部分电离的太阳大气中这些波的衰减以及它们通过离子-中性碰撞对等离子体流出和色球加热的影响。采用联合分析和数值方法代码，采用两流体模型方程，研究部分电离的氢等离子体动力学，包括质子+电子和中性粒子，将它们视为通过离子-中性碰撞耦合的两个独立流体。我们的研究重点放在一个安静的太阳色球区域，它具有重力层化和初始设置的单个磁弧的磁约束。这些波的主要来源是光球下方的太阳对流运动。我们的结果表明，离子-中性碰撞导致这些波的耗散，释放出加热色球等离子体的热能。值得注意的是，这伴随着向上的等离子体流动。最后，我们得出结论，离子-中性碰撞导致两流体等离子模型中的波的耗散，诱发色球加热和等离子体流出。 <div>
This paper offers a fresh perspective on solar chromosphere heating and plasma outflows, focusing on the contribution of waves generated by solar granulation. Utilizing a 2.5D numerical experiment for the partially ionized lower solar atmosphere, we investigate the dissipation of these waves and their impact on plasma outflows and chromospheric heating via ion-neutral collisions. Employing the JOint ANalytical and Numerical Approach code, we adopt two-fluid model equations, examining partially ionized hydrogen plasma dynamics, including protons+electrons and neutrals, treated as two separate fluids that are coupled through ion-neutral collisions. Our investigation focuses on a quiet solar chromosphere region characterized by gravitational stratification and magnetic confinement by an initially set single magnetic arcade. The primary source of the waves is the solar convection beneath the photosphere. Our results demonstrate that ion-neutral collisions result in the dissipation of such waves, releasing thermal energy that heats the chromosphere plasma. Notably, this is accompanied by upward-directed plasma flows. Finally, we conclude that wave dissipation due to ion-neutral collisions in the two-fluid plasma model induces chromosphere heating and plasma outflows.

<div> Andromeda XVI, Andromeda XXVIII, stellar metallicity, Hubble Space Telescope, dwarf galaxies
<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用哈勃太空望远镜的钙H和K窄带成像技术，首次测量了 M31矮星系 Andromeda XVI 和 Andromeda XXVIII 中约300颗恒星的金属丰度。通过测量得知，And XVI 显现出比银河超微矮星系更富含金属的特点，而And XXVIII则位于矮星系质量-金属丰度关系上。两个矮星系的金属丰度分布函数没有明显的金属富集截断，表明恒星形成逐渐减少。此外，两个矮星系的金属丰度梯度与FIRE模拟的预测一致，这一梯度受到恒星反馈的影响，而这导致暗物质核心的形成。研究还包括了19颗金属极贫（[Fe/H] < -3.0）的恒星候选者，占据了And XVI金属丰度分布的7%和And XXVIII的6%。 <div>
We present ∼300 stellar metallicity measurements in two faint M31 dwarf galaxies, Andromeda XVI (MV = −7.5) and Andromeda XXVIII (MV = –8.8), derived using metallicity-sensitive calcium H and K narrowband Hubble Space Telescope imaging. These are the first individual stellar metallicities in And XVI (95 stars). Our And XXVIII sample (191 stars) is a factor of ∼15 increase over literature metallicities. For And XVI, we measure , , and ∇[Fe/H] = −0.23 ± 0.15 dex . We find that And XVI is more metal-rich than Milky Way ultrafaint dwarf galaxies of similar luminosity, which may be a result of its unusually extended star formation history. For And XXVIII, we measure , , and ∇[Fe/H]= −0.46 ± 0.10 dex , placing it on the dwarf galaxy mass–metallicity relation. Neither galaxy has a metallicity distribution function (MDF) with an abrupt metal-rich truncation, suggesting that star formation fell off gradually. The stellar metallicity gradient measurements are among the first for faint (L ≲ 106L⊙) galaxies outside the Milky Way halo. Both galaxies’ gradients are consistent with predictions from the FIRE simulations, where an age–gradient strength relationship is the observational consequence of stellar feedback that produces dark matter cores. We include a catalog for community spectroscopic follow-up, including 19 extremely metal-poor ([Fe/H] < –3.0) star candidates, which make up 7% of And XVI’s MDF and 6% of And XXVIII’s.

热次矮B(sdB)星是被剥离了氦燃烧层的恒星，通常出现在紧密双星系统中，受到强烈的潮汐相互作用影响。对于这类恒星，潮汐激发引起的重力波耗散将改变它们在sdB寿命期间的自转演化。本文中，我们直接计算了现实条件下sdB恒星模型中内部重力波的潮汐激发，并积分了sdB双星的自转轨道演化。我们发现，对于典型的sdB(质量为0.47太阳质量)双星系统，它们能在sdB生命周期内达到潮汐同步的过渡轨道周期约为0.2天，且对伴星质量的依赖性不强。对于由更大质量的前体恒星形成的低质量sdB(质量为0.37太阳质量)，过渡轨道周期变为约0.15天。这些数值与观测中明显的潮汐同步边界(约为0.2天)非常接近。我们讨论了潮汐力矩对恒星半径的依赖性，并对由潮汐同步sdB双星形成的快速旋转白矮星做出了预测。 <br /><br />总结: sdB星是被剥离了氦燃烧层的恒星，常出现在紧密双星系统中，受到强烈的潮汐相互作用影响。本文中，将直接计算了现实条件下sdB恒星模型中内部重力波的潮汐激发，并对sdB双星的自转轨道演化进行了分析。研究发现典型sdB双星系统能在sdB生命周期内达到潮汐同步的过渡轨道周期约为0.2天，对伴星质量的依赖性不强。同时对低质量sdB系统也进行了研究，并对快速旋转白矮星形成做出了预测。 <div>
Hot subdwarf B (sdB) stars are stripped helium-burning stars that are often found in close binaries, where they experience strong tidal interactions. The dissipation of tidally excited gravity waves alters their rotational evolution throughout the sdB lifetime. While many sdB binaries have well-measured rotational and orbital frequencies, there have been few theoretical efforts to accurately calculate the tidal torque produced by gravity waves. In this work, we directly calculate the tidal excitation of internal gravity waves in realistic sdB stellar models and integrate the coupled spin–orbit evolution of sdB binaries. We find that for canonical sdB (MsdB = 0.47 M⊙) binaries, the transitional orbital period below which they could reach tidal synchronization in the sdB lifetime is ∼0.2 day, with weak dependence on the companion masses. For low-mass sdBs (MsdB = 0.37 M⊙) formed from more massive progenitor stars, the transitional orbital period becomes ∼0.15 day. These values are very similar to the tidal synchronization boundary (∼0.2 day) evident from observations. We discuss the dependence of tidal torques on stellar radii, and we make predictions for the rapidly rotating white dwarfs formed from synchronized sdB binaries.

<title>A More Precise Measurement of the Radius of PSR J0740+6620 Using Updated NICER Data</title>

<div> PSR J0740+6620, neutron star, mass, radius, NICER<br />
<br />
PSR J0740+6620是质量精确定的中子星，辐射观测推断其质量为2.08 ± 0.07太阳质量。对其半径的测量有望限制中子星核心的性质。通过对2022年4月21日之前通过NICER积累的数据和XMM-Newton观测的数据进行分析，得出其赤道周长半径为km（68%可信度），这一结果略小于之前的报告，暗示了比之前推测的略软的状态方程。如果将半径限制在16km以下，则68%的可信区间为km，与之前的研究结果接近。 <div>
PSR J0740+6620 is the neutron star with the highest precisely determined mass, inferred from radio observations to be 2.08 ± 0.07 M⊙. Measurements of its radius therefore hold promise to constrain the properties of the cold, catalyzed, high-density matter in neutron star cores. Previously, Miller et al. and Riley et al. reported measurements of the radius of PSR J0740+6620 based on Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) observations accumulated through 2020 April 17, and an exploratory analysis utilizing NICER background estimates and a data set accumulated through 2021 December 28 was presented in Salmi et al. Here we report an updated radius measurement, derived by fitting models of X-ray emission from the neutron star surface to NICER data accumulated through 2022 April 21, totaling ∼1.1 Ms additional exposure compared to the data set analyzed in Miller et al. and Riley et al., and to data from XMM-Newton observations. We find that the equatorial circumferential radius of PSR J0740+6620 is km (68% credibility), a fractional uncertainty ∼83% the width of that reported in Miller et al., in line with statistical expectations given the additional data. If we were to require the radius to be less than 16 km, as was done in Salmi et al., then our 68% credible region would become km, which is close to the headline result of Salmi et al. Our updated measurements, along with other laboratory and astrophysical constraints, imply a slightly softer equation of state than that inferred from our previous measurements.

PSR J0740+6620是一个大质量脉冲星，研究利用2018年至2022年间的NICER数据进行了更新分析。通过将新的NICER数据与XMM-Newton数据联合建模，并利用射电定时测量得到的严格质量先验，确定了该脉冲星的赤道半径和引力质量。结果表明，PSR J0740+6620的半径在11.15至11.7 km之间，质量为1.97至2.04个太阳质量，排除了密集物质的非常软的状态方程。研究还表明，结果不会显著受到NICER和XMM-Newton之间的交叉标定不确定性的影响。此外，通过模拟数据，验证了分析流程的准确性。总结: <br /><br />该研究利用了大量NICER数据更新了PSR J0740+6620脉冲星的半径、质量和加热表面区域的分析。通过联合建模NICER和XMM-Newton数据，采用严格的质量先验，得出了该脉冲星的半径和引力质量，结果排除了非常软的状态方程，且不会受到交叉标定不确定性的影响。同时，作者还验证了分析流程的准确性。 <div>
We report an updated analysis of the radius, mass, and heated surface regions of the massive pulsar PSR J0740+6620 using Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) data from 2018 September 21 to 2022 April 21, a substantial increase in data set size compared to previous analyses. Using a tight mass prior from radio-timing measurements and jointly modeling the new NICER data with XMM-Newton data, the inferred equatorial radius and gravitational mass are km and M⊙, respectively, each reported as the posterior credible interval bounded by the 16% and 84% quantiles, with an estimated systematic error ≲ 0.1 km. This result was obtained using the best computationally feasible sampler settings providing a strong radius lower limit but a slightly more uncertain radius upper limit. The inferred radius interval is also close to the km obtained by Dittmann et al., when they require the radius to be less than 16 km as we do. The results continue to disfavor very soft equations of state for dense matter, with R < 11.15 km for this high-mass pulsar excluded at the 95% probability. The results do not depend significantly on the assumed cross-calibration uncertainty between NICER and XMM-Newton. Using simulated data that resemble the actual observations, we also show that our pipeline is capable of recovering parameters for the inferred models reported in this paper.

总结:红巨星的磁场仍然不太清楚。通过模拟发现，红巨星的表面磁场取决于对流运动的尺度，较大的尺度会产生较强的大尺度磁场。对模拟结果与观测进行比较，发现模拟值与观测值非常接近。另外，还提出了红巨星磁场可能会发生翻转的可能性。 <div>
The magnetic field of red giants is still poorly understood today. Close to the core, asteroseismology has revealed magnetic fields of several hundred thousand gauss, but close to the surface, spectropolarimetric observations of the red giant Pollux only showed an average field of the order of 1 G. Using the ASH code, we conduct a series of 3D nonlinear magnetohydrodynamical simulations aiming at modeling the dynamo process operating within the extended convective envelope of a star similar to the red giant Pollux. We find that the dynamo is efficient even for the slow rotation considered and that large-scale fields are generated and maintained. We further test the correlation between the scale of the convective motions and the surface magnetic field geometry by varying the Prandtl number in our simulations. We show in particular that the value and the geometry of the modeled surface field depend directly on the coupling scales between the magnetic and the velocity fields, with larger convective cells leading to a stronger large-scale magnetic field. We also verify that the dynamo and the geometry of the resulting field are robust against a change of the initial conditions. We then compare our simulations to the observed field and find average ∣Bℓ∣ of about 7 G for the simulation with large convective cells, and down to 2 G for the smaller-scale simulation, very close to the observed value. Finally, we suggest the possibility of the reversal of the red giant’s magnetic field.

<div> 最 massive ETGs, galaxy mergers, low-density environments, tidal features, gas-abundant mergers
<br /><br />
在这篇文章中，研究了436个质量最大的早期星系（ETGs），发现它们在低密度环境下更频繁地展现潮汐特征。研究表明，质量最大的ETGs在低密度环境中更可能经历了近期的星系合并，这暗示它们具有持续到现在的延续形成历史。另外发现，具有较蓝色光谱的质量最大ETGs更加驱动了这一发现，而低密度环境中更常观察到尘埃带，这意味着富含气体的星系合并在增加低密度环境中最近星系合并的速率方面起到了主要作用。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
The most massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) are known to form through numerous galaxy mergers. Thus, it is intriguing to study whether their formation in low-density environments, where nearby companions are almost absent, is associated with mergers, which are directly traced by tidal features. Using the 436 most massive ETGs with Mstar > 1011.2M⊙ at z < 0.04, we determine the variation in the fraction of massive ETGs with tidal features (fT) across different environments and verify whether the most massive ETGs commonly have tidal features in very low density environments. Our main discovery is that the most massive ETGs exhibit tidal features more frequently in lower-density environments. In the highest-density environments, like galaxy clusters, fT is 0.21 ± 0.06, while in the lowest-density environments it triples to 0.62 ± 0.06. This trend is stronger for more extremely massive ETGs, with fT reaching 0.92 ± 0.08 in the lowest-density environments. One explanation for our finding is that the most massive ETGs in lower-density environments have genuinely experienced recent mergers more frequently than their counterparts in higher-density environments, suggesting that they possess extended formation histories that continue into the present. Another possibility is that tidal features last shorter in denser environments owing to external factors inherent in these environments. Our additional findings that massive ETGs with bluer u − r colors are a more dominant driver of our main discovery and that dust lanes are more commonly observed in massive ETGs in low-density environments imply that gas-abundant mergers primarily contribute to the increased rate of recent mergers in low-density environments.

<div> 关键词: PSR J2215+5135, redback spider pulsar, X-ray observations, neutron star mass, intrabinary shock

总结:<br /><br />本研究报告了对PSR J2215+5135进行的新的X射线和U波段观测。通过产生轨道光变曲线并利用其来模拟系统特性，我们得到了最佳拟合的光学模型，给出了中子星质量MNS = 1.98 ± 0.08 M⊙的估计值，比之前报道的要低。然而，由于恒星大气金属丰度的不确定性，导致J2215对此参数特别敏感，我们需要考虑MNS∼1.85–2.3 M⊙的统计范围。从X射线分析中，我们发现IBS环绕着脉冲星，但脉冲星风与伴星风的动量比异常接近于1，意味着IBS几何形态较其他蜘蛛脉冲星更为扁平。通过估算伴星风动量和速度，我们得到伴星的质量损失率约为每年10^(-10)个太阳质量，这意味着J2215可能在大约10亿年内变为孤立的毫秒脉冲星。我们的X射线分析对脉冲星风的磁化和粒子密度施加了限制，并支持高度磁化的相对论IBS中的磁重连接和粒子加速模型。 <div>
PSR J2215+5135 (J2215) is a “redback” spider pulsar, where the intrabinary shock (IBS) wraps around the pulsar rather than the stellar-mass companion. Spider orbital light curves are modulated, dominated by their binary companion thermal emission in the optical bands and by IBS synchrotron emission in the X-rays. We report on new XMM-Newton X-ray and U-band observations of J2215. We produce orbital light curves and use them to model the system properties. Our best-fit optical light model gives a neutron star mass MNS = 1.98 ± 0.08 M⊙, lower than previously reported. However, uncertainty in the stellar atmosphere metallicity, a parameter to which J2215 is unusually sensitive, requires us to consider an acceptable systematic plus statistical range of MNS ∼ 1.85–2.3 M⊙. From the X-ray analysis, we find that the IBS wraps around the pulsar but with a pulsar-wind-to-companion-wind-momentum ratio unusually close to unity, implying a flatter IBS geometry than seen in other spiders. Estimating the companion wind momentum and speed from the X-ray light curve, we find a companion mass-loss rate of yr−1 so that J2215 may become an isolated millisecond pulsar in ∼1 Gyr. Our X-ray analyses place constraints on the magnetization and particle density of the pulsar wind and support models of magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the highly magnetized relativistic IBS.

We present a census of photometrically detected rotation periods for white dwarf (WD) stars. We analyzed the light curves of 9285 WD stars observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite up to Sector 69. Using Fourier transform analyses and the TESS_localize software, we detected variability periods for 318 WD stars. The 115 high-probability likely single WDs in our sample have a median rotational period of 3.9 hr and a median absolute deviation of 3.5 hr. Our distribution is significantly different from the distribution of the rotational period from asteroseismology, which exhibits a longer median period of 24.2 hr and a median absolute deviation of 12.1 hr. In addition, we reported nonpulsating periods for three known pulsating WDs with rotational periods previously determined by asteroseismology: NGC 1501, TIC 7675859, and G226-29. We also calculated evolutionary models including six angular momentum transfer mechanisms from the literature throughout evolution in an attempt to reproduce our findings. Our models indicate that the temperature–period relation of most observational data is best fitted by models with low metallicity, probably indicating problems with the computations of angular momentum loss during the high-mass-loss phase. Our models also generate internal magnetic fields through the Tayler–Spruit dynamo.

Aromatic structures are fundamental for key biological molecules such as RNA and metabolites and the abundances of aromatic molecules on young planets are therefore of high interest. Recent detections of benzonitrile and other aromatic compounds in interstellar clouds and comets have revealed a rich aromatic astrochemistry. In the cold phases of star and planet formation, most of these aromatic molecules are likely to reside in icy grain mantles, where they could be observed through IR spectroscopy. We present laboratory IR spectra of benzene and four monosubstituted benzene molecules—toluene, phenol, benzonitrile, and benzaldehyde—to determine their IR ice absorbances in undiluted aromatic ices, and in mixtures with water and CO. We also characterize the aromatic ice desorption rates, and extract binding energies and respective pre-exponential factors using temperature-programmed desorption experiments. We use these to predict at which protostellar and protoplanetary disk temperatures these molecules sublimate into the gas phase. We find that benzene and monosubstituted benzene derivatives are low-volatility with binding energies in the 5220–8390 K (43–70 kJ mol−1) range, which suggests that most of the chemistry of benzene and of functionalized aromatic molecules is to be expected to occur in the ice phase during star and planet formation.

<div> 关键词: He/H ratio, cool stars, spectroscopic analysis, solar model atmospheres, helium abundance<br />
总结: 本研究通过对观测到的太阳光球谱线的分析，利用MgH分子线和中性Mg原子线的组合，以及CH和C2分子线与中性C原子线的组合，来确定太阳光球的氦丰度。通过采用不同He/H比例的太阳模型大气来进行光谱分析，最终确定了太阳的He/H比例。这一结果对于表征不同有效温度下的冷星的He/H比例提供了重要的参考点。该研究填补了冷星He/H比例的知识空白，是天体物理学中的一个基本挑战。<br /><br /> <div>
Determining the He/H ratio in cool stars presents a fundamental astrophysical challenge. While this ratio is established for hot O and B stars, its extrapolation to cool stars remains uncertain due to the absence of helium lines in their observed spectra. We address this knowledge gap by focusing on the Sun as a representative cool star. We conduct spectroscopic analyses of the observed solar photospheric lines by utilizing a combination of MgH molecular lines and neutral Mg atomic lines including yet another combination of CH and C2 molecular lines with neutral C atomic lines. Our spectroscopic analyses were further exploited by adopting solar model atmospheres constructed for distinct He/H ratios to determine the solar photospheric helium abundance. The helium abundance is determined by enforcing the fact that for an adopted model atmosphere with an appropriate He/H ratio, the derived Mg abundance from the neutral Mg atomic lines and that from the MgH molecular lines must be the same. The same holds for the C abundance derived from neutral C atomic lines and that from CH lines of the CH molecular band and C2 lines from the C2 Swan band. The estimated He/H ratio for the Sun is discussed based on the one-dimensional local thermodynamic equilibrium model atmosphere. The helium abundance (He/H = ) obtained for the Sun serves as a critical reference point to characterize the He/H ratio of cool stars across the range in their effective temperature.

The spectra of several galaxies, including extremely metal-poor galaxies from EMPRESS, have shown that the abundances of some Si-group elements differ from “spherical” explosion models of massive stars. This leads to the speculation that these galaxies have experienced supernova explosions with high asphericity, where mixing and fallback of the inner ejecta with the outer material lead to the distinctive chemical compositions. In this paper, we consider the jet-driven supernova models by direct 2D hydrodynamics simulations using progenitors of about 20–25 M⊙ at zero metallicity. We investigate how the abundance patterns depend on the progenitor mass, mass cut, and asphericity of the explosion. We compare the observable with available supernova and galaxy catalogs based on 56Ni, ejecta mass, and individual element ratios. The proximity of our results with the observational data signifies the importance of aspherical supernova explosions in chemical evolution of these galaxies. Our models will provide the theoretical counterpart for understanding the chemical abundances of high-z galaxies measured by the James Webb Space Telescope.

We present the most detailed spectrum of intracluster light (ICL) in an individual cluster to date, the relaxed system RX J2129.7+0005, at z ∼ 0.234. Using 15 broadband, deep images observed with the Hubble Space Telescope and JWST in the optical and the infrared, plus deep integral field spectroscopy from MUSE, we computed a total of 3696 ICL maps spanning the spectral range ∼0.4−5 μm with our algorithm CICLE, a method that is extremely well suited to analyzing large samples of data in a fully automated way. We used both parametric and nonparametric approaches to fit the spectral energy distribution of the ICL and infer its physical properties, yielding a stellar mass between 11.5 and 12.7 and an average age between 9.7 and 10.5 Gyr, from CIGALE and Prospector results. This implies that the ICL in RX J2129.7+0005 is, on average, older than that of disturbed clusters, suggesting that the contribution from different stellar populations to the ICL is at play depending on the cluster’s dynamical state. Coupled with X-ray observations of the hot gas distribution, we confirm the relaxed state of RX J2129.7+0005, showing clear signs of sloshing after a last major merger with a high-mass-ratio satellite that could have happened ∼6.6 Gyr ago in a relatively radial orbit. The presence of substructure in the ICL, such as shells, clouds with different densities and a certain degree of boxyness, and a clump, supports this scenario.

<title>Characterizing the Rapid Hydrogen Disappearance in SN 2022crv: Evidence of a Continuum between Type Ib and IIb Supernova Properties</title>

总结:
SN 2022crv是一个被发现在NGC 3054中的剥离型超新星，具有Ib/IIb型的特征。早期观测显示出高速氢特征，随后迅速消失。超新星的光谱分析表明其起源于一个质量为4.5-5.6太阳质量的He恒星，可能是从一颗质量为16-22太阳质量的主序星演化而来。此外，NIR光谱显示出一个在He i线的蓝侧的独特吸收特征，可能是由于Sr II。进一步的建模可以揭示超新星的起源以及NIR中神秘吸收特征的本质。<br /><br /> <div>
We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) observations of SN 2022crv, a stripped-envelope supernova in NGC 3054, discovered within 12 hr of explosion by the Distance Less Than 40 Mpc Survey. We suggest that SN 2022crv is a transitional object on the continuum between Type Ib supernovae (SNe Ib) and Type IIb supernovae (SNe IIb). A high-velocity hydrogen feature (∼ −20,000 to −16,000 km s−1) was conspicuous in SN 2022crv at early phases, and then quickly disappeared. We find that a hydrogen envelope of ∼10−3M⊙ can reproduce the observed behavior of the hydrogen feature. The lack of early envelope cooling emission implies that SN 2022crv had a compact progenitor with an extremely low amount of hydrogen. A nebular spectral analysis shows that SN 2022crv is consistent with the explosion of a He star with a final mass of ∼4.5–5.6 M⊙ that evolved from a ∼16 to 22 M⊙ zero-age main-sequence star in a binary system with ∼1.0–1.7 M⊙ of oxygen finally synthesized in the core. In order to retain such a small amount of hydrogen, the initial orbital separation of the binary system is likely larger than ∼1000 R⊙. The NIR spectra of SN 2022crv show a unique absorption feature on the blue side of the He i line at ∼1.005 μm. This is the first time such a feature has been observed in SNe Ib/IIb, and it could be due to Sr II. Further detailed modeling of SN 2022crv can shed light on the progenitor and the origin of the mysterious absorption feature in the NIR.

这篇文章研究了伽玛射线暴（GRBs）的后余辉光曲线和偏振特征，着重分析了能量下降缓慢的浅喷流特征。研究发现，与传统的顶帽喷流模型相比，整体偏振度较低。提供了偏振度峰值的解析表达式，该峰值与能量剖面幂律指数、磁场配置和观测角度有关，并表明对于所有观测者，峰值偏振度发生在光曲线拐点附近。针对GRB 221009A事件，发现在光学和X射线波段，后余辉偏振度的上限与该事件的浅喷流结构猜测相符。同时发现，在早期时刻，偏振水平可能会显著提高，有潜力区分不同的喷流结构模型，并可能约束那个阶段前后冲击波的磁化程度。 
<br /><br />总结: <div>
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are powered by ultrarelativistic jets. The launching sites of these jets are surrounded by dense media, which the jets must cross before they can accelerate and release high-energy emission. Interaction with the medium leads to the formation of a mildly relativistic sheath around the jet, resulting in an angular structure to the jet’s asymptotic Lorentz factor and energy per solid angle, which modifies the afterglow emission. We build a semi-analytical tool to analyze the afterglow light curve and polarization signatures of jets observed from a wide range of viewing angles, and focus on ones with slowly declining energy profiles known as shallow jets. We find overall lower polarization compared to the classical top hat jet model. We provide an analytical expression for the peak polarization degree as a function of the energy profile power-law index, magnetic field configuration, and viewing angle, and show that it occurs near the light-curve break time for all viewers. When applying our tool to GRB 221009A, suspected to originate from a shallow jet, we find that the suggested jet structures for this event agree with the upper limits placed on the afterglow polarization in the optical and X-ray bands. We also find that at early times the polarization levels may be significantly higher, allowing for a potential distinction between different jet structure models and possibly constraining the magnetization in both forward and reverse shocks at that stage.

总结:
本文分析了2000年至2022年间针对Cen A的Chandra先进CCD成像光谱仪观测数据，并开发了一种算法，系统地拟合了其X射线喷流结的固有运动。大多数结的表观固有运动都低于检测限。然而，一个距离核心520光年的结的表观超光速固有运动为2.7 ± 0.4倍光速。这限制了喷流的倾斜角为i < 41° ± 6°，该结的速度为β > 0.94 ± 0.02，这与事件视界望远镜内部喷流测得的倾斜角很一致，但与基于喷流和反喷流亮度的先前估计相矛盾。它还与相应的射电结的固有运动（为0.8 ± 0.1倍光速）相矛盾，这进一步表明X射线和射电波段追踪喷流中不同的结构。喷流核心附近有四个突出的X射线结，但只有一个与固定状态矛盾。一些喷流结在非径向方向上也有显著的固有运动分量，这一分量在喷流中心附近通常更大。我们还在距核心100光年处检测到亮度和形态变化。 <div>
The structure of the jet in Cen A is likely better revealed in X-rays than in the radio band, which is usually used to investigate jet proper motions. In this paper, we analyze Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer observations of Cen A from 2000 to 2022 and develop an algorithm for systematically fitting the proper motions of its X-ray jet knots. Most of the knots had an apparent proper motion below the detection limit. However, one knot at a transverse distance of 520 pc had an apparent superluminal proper motion of 2.7 ± 0.4c. This constrains the inclination of the jet to be i < 41° ± 6° and the velocity of this knot to be β > 0.94 ± 0.02. This agrees well with the inclination measured in the inner jet by the Event Horizon Telescope but contradicts previous estimates based on jet and counterjet brightness. It also disagrees with the proper motion of the corresponding radio knot, of 0.8 ± 0.1c, which further indicates that the X-ray and radio bands trace distinct structures in the jet. There are four prominent X-ray jet knots closer to the nucleus, but only one of these is inconsistent with being stationary. A few jet knots also have a significant proper-motion component in the nonradial direction. This component is typically larger closer to the center of the jet. We also detect brightness and morphology variations at a transverse distance of 100 pc from the nucleus.

The physical origin of the large cavities observed in transition disks is to date still unclear. Different physical mechanisms (e.g., a companion, dead zones, enhanced grain growth) produce disk cavities of different depth, and the expected spatial distribution of gas and solids in each mechanism is not the same. In this work, we analyze the multiwavelength interferometric visibilities of dust continuum observations obtained with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and Very Large Array for six transition disks: CQTau, UXTau A, LkCa15, RXJ1615, SR24S, and DMTau, and calculate brightness radial profiles, where diverse emission morphology is revealed at different wavelengths. The multiwavelength data are used to model the spectral energy distribution and compute constraints on the radial profile of the dust surface density, maximum grain size, and dust temperature in each disk. They are compared with the observational signatures expected from various physical mechanisms responsible for disk cavities. The observational signatures suggest that the cavities observed in the disks around UXTau A, LkCa15, and RXJ1615 could potentially originate from a dust trap created by a companion. Conversely, in the disks around CQTau, SR24S, DMTau, the origin of the cavity remains unclear, although it is compatible with a pressure bump and grain growth within the cavity.

We present near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy using the MMT and Magellan infrared spectrograph for a sample of 29 massive galaxies ( ) at z ∼ 0.7 with optical spectroscopy from the Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census (LEGA-C) survey. Having both optical and NIR spectroscopy at this redshift allows us to measure the full suite of rest-optical strong emission lines, enabling the study of ionization sources and the rest-optical selection of active galactic nuclei (AGN), as well as the measurement of dust-corrected Hα-based star formation rates (SFRs). We find that 11 out of 29 galaxies host AGN. We infer the nonparametric star formation histories with the spectral energy distribution fitting code Prospector and classify galaxies as star-forming, green valley, or quiescent based on their most recent specific SFRs. We explore the connection between AGN activity and suppressed star formation, and find that 89% ± 15% of galaxies in the green valley or below host AGN, while only 15% ± 8% of galaxies above the green valley host AGN. We construct the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) and find that the AGN host galaxies are 0.37 dex below the SFMS, while galaxies without detectable AGN are consistent with being on the SFMS. However, when compared to a bootstrapped mass-matched sample, the SFRs of our sample of AGN host galaxies are consistent with the full LEGA-C sample. Based on this mass-matched analysis, we cannot rule out that this suppression of star formation is driven by other processes associated with the higher mass of the AGN sample. We therefore cannot link the presence of AGN activity to the quenching of star formation.

There is an intriguing and growing population of Neptune-sized planets with stellar obliquities near ∼90°. One previously proposed formation pathway is a disk-driven resonance, which can take place at the end stages of planet formation in a system containing an inner Neptune, outer cold Jupiter, and protoplanetary disk. This mechanism occurs within the first ∼10 Myr, but most of the polar Neptunes we see today are ∼Gyr old. Up until now, there has not been an extensive analysis of whether the polar orbits are stable over ∼Gyr timescales. Tidal realignment mechanisms are known to operate in other systems, and if they are active here, this would cause theoretical tension with a primordial misalignment story. In this paper, we explore the effects of tidal evolution on the disk-driven resonance theory. We use both N-body and secular simulations to study tidal effects on both the initial resonant encounter and long-term evolution. We find that the polar orbits are remarkably stable on ∼Gyr timescales. Inclination damping does not occur for the polar cases, although we do identify subpolar cases where it is important. We consider two case study polar Neptunes, WASP-107 b and HAT-P-11 b, and study them in the context of this theory, finding consistency with present-day properties if their tidal quality factors are Q ≳ 104 and Q ≳ 105, respectively.

We present the results of bicoherence analysis for Swift J1727.8−1613 during its 2023 outburst, using data from Insight-HXMT. Our analysis focused on observations with quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) of frequencies greater than 1 Hz, revealing that all of them belong to type-C QPOs. We found a strong correlation between the QPO frequency and the hardness ratio, as well as a linear relationship between the QPO rms and the hardness ratio. The bicoherence analysis revealed a transition from a “web” pattern to a “hypotenuse” pattern in the low-energy (LE) and high-energy (HE) bands. In the bicoherence patterns, there are correlations between horizontal and vertical bicoherence at f1 = f2 = fQPO with count rates. The diagonal structure at f1 + f2 = fQPO becomes more prominent with increasing energy. Additionally, we discovered a new bicoherence pattern in the medium energy band from 10 to 20 keV; the diagonal structure at f1 + f2 = fhar is prominent only in this energy band, which we refer to as the “parallel” pattern. The bicoherence analysis indicates that the source is likely a low-inclination source.

<title>Analytical Models for Secular Descents in Hierarchical Triple Systems</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Three-body systems are prevalent in nature, from planetary to stellar to supermassive black hole scales. In a hierarchical triple system, oscillations of the inner orbit’s eccentricity and inclination can be induced on secular timescales. Over many cycles, the octupole-level terms in the secular equations of motion can drive the system to extremely high eccentricities via the eccentric Kozai–Lidov (EKL) mechanism. The overall decrease in the inner orbit’s pericenter distance has potentially dramatic effects for realistic systems, such as tidal disruption events. We present an analytical approximation in the test-particle limit to describe individual stepwise increases in eccentricity of the inner orbit. A second approximation, also in the test-particle limit, is obtained by integrating the equations of motion and calibrating to numerical simulations to estimate the overall octupole-level time evolution of the eccentricity. The latter approach is then extended beyond the test particle to the general case. The three novel analytical approximations are compared to numerical solutions to show that the models accurately describe the form and timescale of the secular descent from large distances to a close-encounter distance (e.g., the Roche limit). By circumventing the need for numerical simulations to obtain the long-term behavior, these approximations can be used to readily estimate properties of close encounters and descent timescales for populations of systems. We demonstrate this by calculating rates of EKL-driven migration for Hot Jupiters in stellar binaries.

<title>Recurrent Coronal Mass Ejections and Their Geomagnetic Storms Association on 2012 January 19: Solar Surface to Upper Earth’s Atmosphere Analyses</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad77d4</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this study, we have conducted an analysis of space weather disruptions that occurred on 19 January 2012. Our analysis identified three coronal mass ejections (CMEs), CME1, CME2, and CME3—which were ejected at 09:48:05 universal time (UT), 14:36:05 UT, and 16:12:06 UT, respectively. Nonrecurrent disturbances in space weather, such as geomagnetic storms, result from CMEs originating from the Sun and traveling toward Earth. We assess the contribution of CME–CME interactions on 2012 January 19 and the volume emission rate of nitric oxide (NO) near the Earth's upper atmosphere in prolonging the geomagnetic disturbances observed on 2012 January 23. The findings suggest an increase in intensity at the interacting boundaries of CME1 and CME2, indicating an increase in pressure and density, leading to the compression of the magnetosphere. The 3D reconstructions of the CMEs provide evidence of unequal expansion and rotations within coronagraphic frames attributed to structural variability in the background solar wind during the eruptions. Furthermore, highlights from the in situ observations suggest that the impact of the recurrent CMEs on the geomagnetic disturbance was more pronounced within the auroral region synchronizing with a significant increase in NO volume emission rate on 2012 January 23, near the upper Earth's atmosphere. Our focus is on exploring the interactions between these CMEs to understand their potential contribution to the extended duration of the observed geomagnetic disturbance.

<title>Superfluid Spin-up: Three-dimensional Simulations of Post-glitch Dynamics in Neutron Star Cores</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Neutron stars show a steady decrease in their rotational frequency, occasionally interrupted by sudden spin-up events called glitches. The dynamics of a neutron star after a glitch involve the transfer of angular momentum from the crust (where the glitch is presumed to originate) to the liquid core, causing the core to spin up. The crust–core coupling, which determines how quickly this spin-up proceeds, can be achieved through various physical processes, including Ekman pumping, superfluid vortex-mediated mutual friction, and magnetic fields. Although the complex nature of these mechanisms has made it difficult to study their combined effects, analytical estimations for individual processes reveal that spin-up timescales vary according to the relative strength of Coriolis, viscous, and mutual friction forces, as well as the magnetic field. However, experimental and numerical validations of those analytical predictions are limited. In this paper, we focus on viscous effects and mutual friction. We conduct nonlinear hydrodynamical simulations of the spin-up problem in a two-component fluid by solving the incompressible Hall–Vinen–Bekarevich–Khalatnikov equations in the full sphere (i.e., including r = 0) for the first time. We find that the viscous (normal) component accelerates due to Ekman pumping, although the mutual friction coupling to the superfluid component alters the spin-up dynamics compared to the single-fluid scenario. Close to the sphere’s surface, the response of the superfluid is accurately described by the mutual friction timescale irrespective of its coupling strength with the normal component. However, as we move deeper into the sphere, the superfluid accelerates on different timescales due to the slow viscous spin-up of the internal normal fluid layers. We discuss potential implications for neutron stars, and requirements for future work to build more realistic models.

<title>The Influence of the Magnetic Braking Laws on the Evolution of Persistent and Transient Low-mass X-Ray Binaries</title>

Swift J1858.6−0814 (hereafter J1858) is a transient neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB). There is controversy regarding its donor mass derived from observations and theoretical calculations. In this paper, we adopt seven magnetic braking (MB) prescriptions suggested in the literature and different metallicity Z to simulate the evolution of the LMXB. Our results show that, employing the MB model proposed by A. Reiners & S. Mohanty (“rm12”), the convection- and rotation-boosted (“carb”) model, and the intermediate (“inter”) and convection-boosted (“cboost”) models in K. X. Van et al. can match (part of) the observational parameters of J1858 well. We then apply our method to other observed LMXBs and find that the “rm12” and “inter” MB laws are most promising in explaining transient LMXBs. In comparison, the simulations with the “cboost” and “carb” MB laws are more inclined to reproduce persistent LMXBs and ultracompact X-ray binaries, respectively. Our results, though subject to computational and/or observational bias, show that it is challenging to find a unified MB law that applies to the NS LMXB subpopulations simultaneously, indicating our lack of understanding of the true MB law. In addition, we explore the influence of various MB laws on the magnitude of the bifurcation periods in LMXBs.

<title>Evidence of a Forming Nucleus in the Fourcade–Figueroa Galaxy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We analyze data from the IRAS, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, and Planck satellites, revealing an unresolved dust condensation at the center of the Fourcade–Figueroa galaxy (ESO270-G017), which may correspond to a forming nucleus. We model the condensation’s continuum spectrum in the spectral range from 3 to 1300 μm using the DUSTY code. The best-fit model, based on the chi-square test, indicates that the condensation is a shell with an outer temperature of Tout ≈ 12 K and an inner boundary temperature of Ti ≈ 500 K. The shell’s outer radius is ro = 86.2 pc, and the inner cavity radius is ri = 0.082 pc. The condensation produces an extinction AV = 50 mag, and its luminosity is Lc = 1.08 × 1034 W, which would correspond to a burst of massive star formation approximately similar to the central 5 pc of R 136 in the LMC and NGC 3603, the ionizing cluster of a giant Carina arm H ii region. The comparison with normal, luminous, and ultraluminous IR galaxies leads us to consider this obscured nucleus as the nearest and weakest object of this category.

<title>An Extremely Active Repeating Fast Radio Burst Source in a Likely Nonmagneto-ionic Environment</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright radio bursts originating at cosmological distances. Only three repeating FRBs FRB 20121102A, FRB 20190520B, and FRB 20201124A among ∼60 known repeating FRBs have circular polarization. We observed the FRB 20220912A with the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) at L-band on 2022 October 24 and detected 128 bursts in 1.4 hr, corresponding to a burst rate of about 90 hr−1, which is the highest yet for FRBs observed by the GBT. The average rotation measure (RM) was −0.4 ± 0.3 rad m−2 with negligible intraday RM change, indicating a likely nonmagneto-ionic environment. A total of 61% of bursts have a linear polarization fraction greater than 90%. Approximately 56% of the bright bursts have circular polarization. A downward drift in frequency and polarization angle swings were found in our sample. The characterization of FRB 20220912A indicates that the circular polarization is unlikely to be caused by the magneto-ionic environment for at least some of the repeating FRB population.

变量星在星团中提供了恒星演化和脉动模型的关键约束。研究利用哈勃空间望远镜的Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT)调查的存档数据，通过对稀疏的PHAT光变曲线和差分成像的统计分析，识别了M31星团中的86颗明亮（F814W < 19）的变量星。利用文献中的宿主星团属性匹配理论等时线，确定这些变量星的演化阶段和初始质量。根据每个星团-变量星的PHAT光度被混合的概率来计算文中的可信度。研究发现86颗星团-变量星的初始质量介于0.8和67 M⊙之间。它们的演化阶段跨越了主序、更进化的氢和氦燃烧阶段，以及后–红巨星分支。鉴定了多个变量星类型：RV Tauri变星、红超巨星和缓慢脉动的B型超巨星，以及Wolf–Rayet恒星、α Cygni和Mira变星，一个经典的Cepheid，以及一个可能的超红巨星。通过其差分图像质量和较低的混合概率，对12颗星团-变量星进行了更高置信度的表征。这是首个利用哈勃空间望远镜的超清晰度对外星际星团中的变量星进行系统研究的研究，展示了星团在约束变量星的基本性质上的独特能力。

Variable stars in stellar clusters can offer key constraints on stellar evolution and pulsation models, utilizing estimates of host cluster properties to constrain stellar physical parameters. We present a catalog of 86 luminous (F814W < 19) variable stars in M31 clusters identified by mining the archival Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey using a combination of statistical analysis of sparse PHAT light curves and difference imaging. We determine the evolutionary phases and initial masses of these variable stars by matching them with theoretical isochrones generated using host cluster properties from the literature. We calculate the probability of PHAT photometry being blended due to the highly crowded nature of cluster environments for each cluster-variable star, using these probabilities to inform our level of confidence in the derived properties of each star. Our 86 cluster-variable stars have initial masses between 0.8 and 67 M⊙. Their evolutionary phases span the main sequence, more evolved hydrogen- and helium-burning phases, and the post–asymptotic giant branch. We identify numerous candidate variable star types: RV Tauri variables, red supergiants, and slowly pulsating B-type supergiants, along with Wolf–Rayet stars, α Cygni and Mira variables, a classical Cepheid, and a possible superasymptotic giant. We characterize 12 cluster-variable stars at higher confidence based on their difference image quality and lower blending probability. Ours is the first systematic study of variable stars in extragalactic stellar clusters leveraging the superior resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope and demonstrating the unique power of stellar clusters in constraining the fundamental properties of variable stars.

Extraterrestrial material collected during space missions is highly exposed to contamination issues during on-Earth analysis. Although high-protection-level protocols were developed, to minimize the contamination due to sample manipulation and the substrate contribution an optimal strategy is to perform in situ analysis with contactless techniques. Optical and acoustic trapping represent ideal candidates for contactless manipulation and analysis of nanometer-to-millimeter-sized particles. Here, we show results of the manipulation of cometary analogs and micrometeorite samples using a single-axis acoustic levitator. The investigation of the particle dynamics in the trap allows the calculation of the trap spring constants that are found in the mN/m range. In addition, we collect the Raman spectra of two levitated fragments of Saratov meteorite, demonstrating that acoustic levitation can be effectively used for the contactless and low-contamination characterization of samples of interest in astrophysics.

<title>A Millimeter Rebrightening in GRB 210702A</title>

<br />GRB 210702A是一次明亮的长频闪射，研究者观测到了97.5 GHz的显著再变亮，首次在毫米波余辉光变曲线中观测到了这种再变亮现象。标准的前冲冲击模型不能解释毫米波再亮化，可能需要考虑能量注入或者来自晚期壳层碰撞的反冲击。同时，类似于其他爆发的情况，射电数据可能需要考虑其他可能的解释。这些观测结果表明毫米波光变曲线可能具有一些更常见于光学和X射线余辉光变曲线的丰富特征。 <br /><br />总结:GRB 210702A的毫米波余辉观测表明存在再亮化现象，研究人员对引入能量或者晚期壳层碰撞的反冲击作为可能的解释进行了讨论。另外，射电数据可能需要新的解释，这些观测结果为进一步研究GRB余辉提供了动力。 <div>
We present X-ray to radio frequency observations of the bright long gamma-ray burst GRB 210702A. Our Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array 97.5 GHz observations show a significant rebrightening by a factor of ≈2 beginning at 8.2 days post-burst and rising to peak brightness at 18.1 days before declining again. This is the first such rebrightening seen in a millimeter afterglow light curve. A standard forward shock model in a stellar wind circumburst medium can explain most of our X-ray, optical, and millimeter observations prior to the rebrightening, but significantly overpredicts the self-absorbed radio emission, and cannot explain the millimeter rebrightening. We investigate possible explanations for the millimeter rebrightening, and find that energy injection or a reverse shock from a late-time shell collision are plausible causes. Similar to other bursts, our radio data may require alternative scenarios such as a thermal electron population or a structured jet to explain the data. Our observations demonstrate that millimeter light curves can exhibit some of the rich features more commonly seen in optical and X-ray afterglow light curves, motivating further millimeter wavelength studies of GRB afterglows.

To investigate the short-term variability and determine the size of the optical continuum emitting region of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), we carried out high-cadence, multiband photometric monitoring of a Seyfert 1 galaxy J0249−0815 across two nights, together with a one-night single-band preliminary test. The presence of the broad Hα component in our target was confirmed by recent Palomar/P200 spectroscopic observations, 23 yr after the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, ruling out the supernovae origin of the broad Hα line. The photometric experiment was primarily conducted utilizing four-channel imagers MuSCAT 3 and 4 mounted on 2 m telescopes within the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network. Despite the expectation of variability, we observed no significant variation (<1.4%) on timescales of 6–10 hr. This nondetection is likely due to substantial host galaxy light diluting the subtle active galactic nucleus (AGN) variability. Additionally, we cannot rule out that the target was in a relatively quiescent state without intranight variability during our monitoring, owing to the stochastic nature of AGN variations. To enhance the possibility of detecting subtle variability signals and lag in future IMBH reverberation campaigns, it may be beneficial to select targets with a higher AGN-to-host flux ratio, and conduct dual-band preliminary tests and tailored simulations.

总结：<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了氢电离极紫外辐射引起的光蒸发对天体物体的重要影响。作者构建了一个解析模型，考虑了光加热和光电离的有限时间尺度，并将其应用于原行星盘的散射过程。与经典的完全电离和等温风模型相比，该模型提供了更准确的电离、温度和离心距离的速度估计。文章指出，光蒸发风在中心恒星的EUV辐射率和光谱硬度下呈现出几种不同的流体动力学和热化学状态。研究还展示了光蒸发效率如何随着EUV照射强度和光谱硬度的变化而变化，以及解决了关于X射线光蒸发效果的文献差异。该模型强调了光加热和光电离时间尺度对于建模和理解风观测行为的重要性。 <div>
Photoevaporation driven by hydrogen-ionizing extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) radiation profoundly shapes the lives of diverse astrophysical objects. We construct an analytical model accounting for the finite timescales of photoheating and photoionization and apply it to the dispersal of protoplanetary disks. The model yields improved estimates for the ionization, temperature, and velocity versus distance from the central source when compared to the classical picture of fully ionized and isothermal winds with temperatures ≈104 K and speeds ≈10 km s−1. In contrast to the classical picture, the photoevaporative winds take on several distinct hydrodynamical and thermochemical states depending on the central star’s EUV emission rate and spectral hardness: T Tauri stars with EUV luminosities around 1030 erg s−1 drive nonisothermal ionized disk winds at lower temperatures than the classical value if the spectrum is soft, with an average deposited energy per photoionization less than about 3.7 eV. If, however, the spectrum is hard, the winds tend to be atomic and isothermal at most disk radii. For lower EUV intensities, even with soft spectra, atomic winds can emerge beyond ∼10 au through advection. We show that these predictions are in general agreement with detailed radiation hydrodynamics calculations. The model furthermore illustrates how the energy efficiency of photoevaporation varies with the intensity and spectral hardness of the EUV illumination, as well as addressing discrepancies in the literature around the effectiveness of X-ray photoevaporation. The findings highlight the importance of the photoheating and photoionization timescales both for modeling and for understanding winds’ observed behavior.

<br />
热Sunyaev-Zeldovich效应是在L*星系的环星系介质中产生的，使用了CGM模型、新的幂律模型和TNG100模拟。研究发现，对于给定的Mvir，PLM有四个参数：halo baryon质量在热CGM气体中的分数fhCGM，virial半径处实际气体温度与virial温度的比例ϕT，热电子压力和氢核密度的幂律指数aP,th和an。B+22 Compton-y剖面暗示了陡峭的电子压力斜率(aP,th≈2)。对于等熵状态，可能存在静压平衡。B+22和D+23的结果与最近的CGM X射线观测结果一致。至于TNG100模拟，对于L*星系，它低估了tSZ参数约0.5 dex，这表明模拟中在这些质量尺度上高估了反馈强度和CGM气体损失。
<br /><br />总结: 热SZ效应的测量显示了L*星系的CGM特征，并表明使用PLM和TNG100模拟可以得出一致的结论。研究发现CGM中的气体可能存在等熵状态，并且结果与实际观测相一致。然而，模拟结果低估了tSZ参数，这可能是由于在模拟中过高估计了反馈效应和CGM气体损失。 <div>
We analyze measurements of the thermal Sunyaev–Zeldovich (tSZ) effect arising in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of L* galaxies, reported by J. N. Bregman et al. (B+22) and S. Das et al. (D+23). In our analysis, we use the Y. Faerman et al. CGM models, a new power-law model (PLM), and the TNG100 simulation. For a given Mvir, our PLM has four parameters: the fraction, fhCGM, of the halo baryon mass in hot CGM gas, the ratio, ϕT, of the actual gas temperature at the virial radius to the virial temperature, and the power-law indices, aP,th and an for the thermal electron pressure and the hydrogen nucleon density. The B+22 Compton-y profile implies steep electron pressure slopes (aP,th ≃ 2). For isothermal conditions, the temperature is at least 1.1 × 106 K, with a hot CGM gas mass of up to 3.5 × 1011M⊙ for a virial mass of 2.75 × 1012M⊙. However, if isothermal, the gas must be expanding out of the halos. An isentropic equation of state is favored for which hydrostatic equilibrium is possible. The B+22 and D+23 results are consistent with each other and with recent (0.5–2 keV) CGM X-ray observations of Milky Way mass systems. For Mvir ≃ 3 × 1012M⊙, the scaled Compton pressure integrals, , lie in the narrow range, 2.5 × 10−4–5.0 × 10−4 kpc2, for all three sets of observations. TNG100 underpredicts the tSZ parameters by factors ∼0.5 dex for the L* galaxies, suggesting that the feedback strengths and CGM gas losses are overestimated in the simulated halos at these mass scales.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章报告了对四个z≳6夸asar领域的观测结果，使用JWST/NIRCam进行成像和宽场无筒光谱模式。研究发现在夸asar周围的氧三发射星系数量存在广泛的差异，密度增强范围在2cMpc半径内为δ≈65，而另一些区域的密度对比接近零。通过测量夸asar及其周围星系的两点交叉相关函数，以及星系自相关函数，推断出〈z〉=6.25时夸asar的相关长度为，而氧三发射星系的相关长度为。通过与暗物质模拟比较，估计夸asar宿主暗物质暗物质最小质量为，而对于氧三发射体是。研究结果表明，光度夸asar并不一定位于早期宇宙中最密集的区域，而且这些红移处的紫外光夸asar活跃周期fduty≪1。这种短暂的夸asar活动周期挑战了我们对早期超大质量黑洞生长的理解，并为高度尘埃遮挡的生长阶段或间歇的，辐射低效的吸积率提供了证据。 <div>
We expect luminous (M1450 ≲ −26.5) high-redshift quasars to trace the highest-density peaks in the early Universe. Here, we present observations of four z ≳ 6 quasar fields using JWST/NIRCam in the imaging and wide-field slitless spectroscopy mode and report a wide range in the number of detected [O iii]-emitting galaxies in the quasars’ environments, ranging between a density enhancement of δ ≈ 65 within a 2 cMpc radius—one of the largest protoclusters during the Epoch of Reionization discovered to date—to a density contrast consistent with zero, indicating the presence of a UV-luminous quasar in a region comparable to the average density of the Universe. By measuring the two-point cross-correlation function of quasars and their surrounding galaxies, as well as the galaxy autocorrelation function, we infer a correlation length of quasars at 〈z〉 = 6.25 of , while we obtain a correlation length of the [O iii]-emitting galaxies of . By comparing the correlation functions to dark-matter-only simulations we estimate the minimum mass of the quasars’ host dark matter halos to be (and for the [O iii] emitters), indicating that (a) luminous quasars do not necessarily reside within the most overdense regions in the early Universe, and that (b) the UV-luminous duty cycle of quasar activity at these redshifts is fduty ≪ 1. Such short quasar activity timescales challenge our understanding of early supermassive black hole growth and provide evidence for highly dust-obscured growth phases or episodic, radiatively inefficient accretion rates.

<div> 年轻恒星，Upper Sco，吸积爆发，出流迹象，伴星，光谱天文学

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了位于Upper Sco的一个年轻恒星2MASS J16075796-2040087，发现了其存在大约15天的吸积爆发和多组分禁止辐射线(FEL)所示的出流，这在其年龄上是不寻常的。研究表明，吸积爆发可能是由距离约4.6天文单位的伴星引发的。通过光谱天文学分析发现，FEL的高速组分(HVC)追踪着一个不对称的双极喷流，长约700天文单位，而低速发射线则与HVC更为相似，难以确定MHD盘风成分。作者提出了一个假设，即由于靠近伴星的恒星吸积爆发推动了喷流活动，而在这种活动通常在大多数恒星的年龄结束时停止。所研究的低速发射线可能来自于靠近伴星附近的缓慢喷流，与MHD风的发射混合在一起。 <div>
2MASS J16075796-2040087 is an ∼5 Myr young star in Upper Sco with evidence for accretion bursts on a timescale of about 15 days and, uncommonly for its age, outflows traced by multicomponent forbidden emission lines (FELs). The accretion bursts may be triggered by a companion at ∼4.6 au. We analyze HIRES spectra optimised for spectro-astrometry to better understand the origin of the several FEL velocity components and determine whether a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disk wind is present. The FEL high-velocity component (HVC) traces an asymmetric, bipolar jet ∼700 au long. The jet’s position angle ∼ 277° is not perpendicular to the disk. The lower-velocity emission, classified previously as a disk wind low-velocity component, is found to have more in common with the HVC and overall it is not possible to identify an MHD disk wind component. The spectro-astrometric signal of the low-velocity emission resembles those of jets and its density and ionisation fraction fall into the range of HVCs. We suggest a scenario where the accretion bursts due to the close companion power the jets past the age where such activity ends around most stars. The low-velocity emission here could come from a slow jet launched near the close companion and this emission would be blended with emission from the MHD wind.

<br /><br />总结:
这篇论文对旋转、磁化和稳定分层恒星的线性稳定性分析进行了系统修订。对于Bϕ的合理配置，不稳定性需要扩散过程：粘性、磁扩散率或热量/成分扩散。我们的结果展示了一个新的物理图景，证明了不同扩散效应独立地触发了旋转恒星中两种波的不稳定性：磁流线波和惯性波。它通过波的过稳定性发展，其增长率在一些特征波数急剧达到峰值。我们确定了每种波分支的不稳定条件，并找到了特征波数。对于磁普朗数Pm ≪ 1（例如太阳）和Pm ≫ 1（例如原中子星），不稳定模式的参数依赖性表明了可能的Tayler–Spruit发电机的非通用尺度。 <div>
Tayler instability of toroidal magnetic fields Bϕ is broadly invoked as a trigger for turbulence and angular momentum transport in stars. This paper presents a systematic revision of the linear stability analysis for a rotating, magnetized, and stably stratified star. For plausible configurations of Bϕ, instability requires diffusive processes: viscosity, magnetic diffusivity, or thermal/compositional diffusion. Our results reveal a new physical picture, demonstrating how different diffusive effects independently trigger instability of two types of waves in the rotating star: magnetostrophic waves and inertial waves. It develops via overstability of the waves, whose growth rate sharply peaks at some characteristic wavenumbers. We determine instability conditions for each wave branch and find the characteristic wavenumbers. The results are qualitatively different for stars with magnetic Prandtl number Pm ≪ 1 (e.g., the Sun) and Pm ≫ 1 (e.g., protoneutron stars). The parameter dependence of unstable modes suggests a nonuniversal scaling of the possible Tayler–Spruit dynamo.

<br /><br />研究旨在利用多空间探测器对磁云进行测量，以更好地限制和理解磁场扩展对其性质的影响。通过开发参数γ来比较多个探测器测得的磁场分量，利用磁场数据的最小方差技术获得轴向和方位角分量。γ参数作为前边界的一个指标，用来衡量磁云轴向和方位角磁场分量随着太阳风距离的演变的全局差异。我们的目标是确定所研究的磁云是否表现出自相似的膨胀，以及如果是这样，这种膨胀是否主要是各向同性的或径向的，基于估计的γ值。通过对多个探测器数据的分析，我们观察到所检查的示例中γ值的显著一致性。我们发现这些磁云的整体膨胀往往是各向同性的，而从磁云后边界得到的γ值通常显示出各向异性的行为，特别是当两个探测器观测之间的距离相对较短时。这一发现为完善磁力线圈模型和推进我们对伴随日冕物质抛射的膨胀过程的理解提供了见解。<br /><br />总结: 本研究利用多个空间探测器测量了磁云的磁场，并开发了参数γ来比较磁场分量。研究发现磁云的整体膨胀往往是各向同性的，而局部膨胀则显示出各向异性的行为。这为完善磁力线圈模型和推进我们对伴随日冕物质抛射的膨胀过程的理解提供了见解。 <div>
The aim of this study is to use multispacecraft measurements of interplanetary magnetic clouds (MCs) to better constrain and understand the effect of expansion on their magnetic field properties. We develop a parameter (γ) for comparing magnetic field components measured at multiple spacecraft. We use the minimum variance technique on the magnetic field data to obtain the axial and azimuthal components. The parameter γ acts at the front boundary as a measure of the global difference in the evolution with heliospheric distance of the axial and azimuthal magnetic field components of MCs. Our goal is to determine whether the studied MCs exhibit self-similar expansion and, if so, whether this expansion is predominantly isotropic or radial, based on the estimated γ. Through our analysis of data from multiple spacecraft, we observe a notable consistency in the γ values across the examples examined. We find that the overall expansion of these MCs tends to be isotropic, while the local expansion of MCs, derived from the γ values measured at the rear boundary of MCs, usually shows anisotropic behavior, particularly when the distances between the observations from the two spacecraft are relatively short. This discovery offers insights for refining flux rope models and advancing our comprehension of the expansion processes associated with coronal mass ejections.

<div> 关键词: Dark matter subhalos, Milky Way, LMC analog, stream encounter rates, FIRE-2 simulations

总结:
本文使用FIRE-2模拟了银河系质量的星系，展示了LMC模拟对流体-次哈洛相遇率的影响。LMC模拟带来了许多次哈洛，使得靠近这一大型卫星的流体的相遇率增加了10%至40%。此外，LMC模拟还使宿主星系偏离了质心位置，引起了反射运动，导致次哈洛的密度和径向速度分布出现南北不对称性。这种不对称性，与LMC模拟次哈洛的存在结合起来，导致了在相同距离处的相遇率在天空的不同位置上变化了50%至70%，尤其是在LMC模拟的相反位置上。此外，LMC模拟还在宿主暗物质晕中引起了密度尾迹，进一步提高了接近LMC模拟的相遇率。作者还探讨了流体轨道特性对相遇率的影响，发现相对LMC模拟轨道背行运动的流体，其相遇率在相反象限内增加了50%。最后，作者报告了银河系流体在模拟背景下的相遇率，分别考虑了有无LMC模拟的情况。相遇率依赖于流体位置、轨道和它们相对LMC的位置，这对于在哪里寻找在银河系中出现的带状和间隙的流体具有重要意义。 <div>
Dark matter subhalos are predicted to perturb stellar streams; stream morphologies and dynamics can, therefore, constrain the mass distribution of subhalos. Using FIRE-2 simulations of Milky Way–mass galaxies, we demonstrate that the presence of an LMC analog significantly changes stream–subhalo encounter rates. The LMC analog brings in many subhalos, increasing encounter rates for streams near the massive satellite by 10%–40%. Additionally, the LMC analog displaces the host from its center of mass (inducing reflex motion), which causes a north–south asymmetry in the density and radial velocity distributions of subhalos. This asymmetry, combined with the presence of LMC-analog subhalos, causes encounter rates at the same distance to vary by 50%–70% across the sky, particularly in regions opposite the LMC analog. Furthermore, the LMC analog induces a density wake in the host's dark matter halo, further boosting the encounter rates near the LMC analog. We also explore how stream orbital properties affect encounter rates, finding up to a 50% increase for streams moving retrograde to the LMC analog’s orbit in the opposite quadrant. Finally, we report the encounter rates for Milky Way streams within the context of our simulations, both with and without the presence of an LMC analog. The dependence of encounter rates on stream location, orbit, and their position relative to the LMC has important implications for where to search for streams with spurs and gaps in the Milky Way.

<div> BNS mergers, gravitational-wave observations, nuclear equation of state, TOV equations, emulators
总结：<br /><br />本文探讨了通过模拟解决TOV方程的方法，包括多层感知器（MLPs）、高斯过程和一种数据驱动的简化基础方法（RBM）。研究发现，MLP型模拟器通常比其他两种算法更准确，而RBM则能够最大程度地加快处理TOV方程的速度。文章还展示了利用这些模拟器进行简单参数推断的应用，并显示我们的模拟器预测的后验概率与通过完整的TOV求解器获得的后验概率非常一致。 <div>
Gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron-star (BNS) mergers have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the nuclear equation of state (EOS) and the fundamental interactions that determine its properties. However, Bayesian parameter estimation frameworks do not typically sample over microscopic nuclear-physics parameters that determine the EOS. One of the major hurdles in doing so is the computational cost involved in solving the neutron-star structure equations, known as the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff (TOV) equations. In this paper, we explore approaches to emulating solutions for the TOV equations: multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), Gaussian processes, and a data-driven variant of the reduced basis method (RBM). We implement these emulators for three different parameterizations of the nuclear EOS, each with a different degree of complexity represented by the number of model parameters. We find that our MLP-based emulators are generally more accurate than the other two algorithms, whereas the RBM results in the largest speedup with respect to the full high-fidelity TOV solver. We employ these emulators for a simple parameter inference using a potentially loud BNS observation and show that the posteriors predicted by our emulators are in excellent agreement with those obtained from the full TOV solver.

Let me know if you need anything else! <div>
A technique has recently been developed for tracking short-term spectral variations in Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) using data from a single neutron monitor (NM), by collecting histograms of the time delay between successive neutron counts and extracting the leader fraction L as a proxy of the spectral index. Here we analyze L from four Antarctic NMs from 2015 March to 2023 September. We have calibrated L from the South Pole NM with respect to a daily spectral index determined from published data of GCR proton fluxes during 2015–2019 from the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) on board the International Space Station. Our results demonstrate a robust correlation between the leader fraction and the spectral index fit over the rigidity range 2.97–16.6 GV for AMS-02 data, with uncertainty of 0.018 in the daily spectral index as inferred from L. In addition to the 11 yr solar activity cycle, a wavelet analysis confirms a 27 day periodicity in the GCR flux and spectral index corresponding to solar rotation, especially near sunspot minimum, while the flux occasionally exhibits a strong harmonic at 13.5 days. The magnetic field component along a nominal Parker spiral (i.e., the magnetic sector structure) is a strong determinant of such spectral and flux variations, with the solar wind speed exerting an additional, nearly rigidity-independent influence on flux variations. Our investigation affirms the capability of ground-based NM stations to accurately and continuously monitor cosmic-ray spectral variations over the long-term future.

总结: 本文通过全球地面探测器观测到的宇宙射线强度的两次显著下降进行了全球分析。文章分别针对时间和刚度导出了宇宙射线密度和各向同性。文章还提出了一个简单的扩散模型，描绘了地球和宇宙射线障碍之间的螺旋磁场线，指出这两次事件的长时间持续性可能是由类似星际冲击波以及随后的太阳风剪切区和/或日冕相互作用区域（CIR）的约190°的东部范围产生的。文章还探讨了导致“幻影福布斯减少（FD）”在不同刚度下呈现出不同特征的可能物理原因。这些结果表明地球观测到的高能宇宙射线对遥远的太空天气做出了响应。 <div>
This paper presents the global analysis of two extended decreases in the galactic cosmic-ray intensity observed by worldwide networks of ground-based detectors in 2012. This analysis is capable of separately deriving the cosmic-ray density (or omnidirectional intensity) and anisotropy, each as a function of time and rigidity. A simple diffusion model along the spiral field line between Earth and a cosmic-ray barrier indicates the long duration of these events, resulting from about 190° eastern extent of a barrier such as an interplanetary shock followed by the sheath region and/or the corotating interaction region (CIR). It is suggested that the coronal mass ejection merging with and compressing the preexisting CIR at its flank can produce such an extended barrier. The derived rigidity spectra of the density and anisotropy both vary in time during each event period. In particular we find that the temporal feature of the “phantom Forbush decrease (FD)” reported in an analyzed period is dependent on rigidity, and looks quite different at different rigidities. From these rigidity spectra of the density and anisotropy, we derive the rigidity spectrum of the average parallel mean free path of pitch angle scattering along the spiral field line and infer the power spectrum of the magnetic fluctuation and its temporal variation. The possible physical cause of the strong rigidity dependence of the phantom FD is also discussed. These results demonstrate the high-energy cosmic rays observed at Earth responding to remote space weather.

AstroSat和Insight-HXMT观测到了4U 2206+54的X射线脉冲，并发现了不同的脉冲周期。该脉冲星经历了从减速到现在的加速旋转，并且目前的平均加速率为1.2 × 10−13 Hz s−1。相位平均光谱展示了脉冲星附近的热点区域，并且利用准球形沉积吸积理论解释了脉冲星的加速旋转和可能的强磁场。.<br /><br /> <div>
We report the timing and spectral studies of the accreting X-ray pulsar 4U 2206+54 using AstroSat and Insight-HXMT observations taken in 2016 and 2020 respectively. X-ray pulsations from the system are detected by both missions. The AstroSat discovered a significant periodic signal at ∼5619 s in 2016, and Insight-HXMT found a pulsation period at ∼5291 s in 2020. A comparison of its spin-period evolution with the present spin-period estimates shows that the neutron star in 4U 2206+54 now has recently been undergoing a spin-up episode after attaining to its slow pulsations of 5750 s around 2015 from its prolonged spin-down phase. The present average spin-up rate of the pulsar is found to be at ∼1.2 × 10−13 Hz s−1. The phase-averaged spectra of the pulsar in 1–60 keV could be explained with a high-energy cutoff power-law continuum model; no evident line features are found with AstroSat. The application of Comptonization models such as comptt and compmag to the phase-averaged spectra of 4U 2206+54 reveals a hotter source photon region near the pulsar with an emission size extending to ∼2–2.8 km. Using the quasi-spherical settling accretion theory, we explain the present spin-up and the possibility of the strong magnetic field of the pulsar.

Luminous accretion disks around black holes are expected to have densities of ∼1015−1022 cm−3, which are high enough that plasma physics effects become important. Many of these effects have been traditionally neglected in the calculation of atomic parameters, and therefore in photoionization models and ultimately also in X-ray reflection models. In this paper, we describe updates to the atomic rates used by the xstar code, which is in turn part of the xillver disk reflection model. We discuss the effect of adding necessary high-density corrections into the xillver code. Specifically, we find that the change of recombination rates plays an important role, dominating the differences between model versions. With synthetic spectra, we show that, even in a highly ionized state, high-density slabs can produce strong iron (∼6.5–9 keV) and oxygen (∼0.6–0.8 keV) resonance features. The significant iron emission could address the problem of the supersolar iron abundances found in some sources.

总结:<br />
这篇论文发现了五个新的Heartbeat stars (HBSs)并且发现它们表现出了tidally excited oscillations (TEOs)，使用了TESS光度数据。通过修正Kumar等人的模型，利用Markov Chain Monte Carlo方法，得出了这些系统的轨道参数。对这些对象的TEOs进行了分析，并识别了它们的脉动相位和模式。提出TIC 266809405，TIC 266894805和TIC 412881444中的TEO脉动相位与主要的l = 2，m = 0或±2球谐波一致。 虽然TIC 11619404的TEO相位接近m = +2模式，但由于该系统的低倾角，m = 0模式也不能被排除。TIC 447927324的TEO相位与绝热期望有明显偏差(>2σ)，这表明它可能是一个行波，或者脉动是非绝热的。此外，这些TEOs发生在相对较低的轨道谐波上，我们谨慎地认为这可能是一种观测偏差。这些对象是研究偏心轨道双星结构和演化，以及扩展TESS HBS目录的宝贵资源。 <div>
Heartbeat stars (HBSs) with tidally excited oscillations (TEOs) are ideal astrophysical laboratories for studying the internal properties of the systems. In this paper, five new HBSs exhibiting TEOs are discovered using TESS photometric data. The orbital parameters are derived using a corrected version of Kumar et al.'s model based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. The TEOs in these objects are examined, and their pulsation phases and modes are identified. The pulsation phases of the TEOs in TIC 266809405, TIC 266894805, and TIC 412881444 are consistent with the dominant l = 2, m = 0, or ±2 spherical harmonic. For TIC 11619404, although the TEO phase is close to the m = +2 mode, the m = 0 mode cannot be excluded because of the low inclination in this system. The TEO phase in TIC 447927324 shows a large deviation (>2σ) from the adiabatic expectations, suggesting that it is expected to be a traveling wave or that the pulsations are nonadiabatic. In addition, these TEOs occur at relatively low orbital harmonics, and we cautiously suggest that this may be an observational bias. These objects are valuable sources for studying the structure and evolution of eccentricity orbit binaries and extending the TESS HBS catalog with TEOs.

Radio spectral shape of quasars can provide insight into the ages of quasars. We have compiled data for 1804 quasars with z ≲ 1 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Additionally, these quasars were also mapped by the Low-Frequency Array at 144 MHz and the Very Large Array Sky Survey at 3000 MHz. The radio spectral index, designated as (with S(ν) ∝ να), is analyzed between 144 and 3000 MHz as a proxy for the ages of quasars. We measure the [O III] λ5007 emission line in the SDSS spectra. A strong correlation was found between the equivalent width of the core component of the [O III] λ5007 emission line and . This relationship suggests that the core component of the [O III] λ5007 emission line could potentially serve as a surrogate for the evolutionary stage of a quasar. The quasars at an early stage of evolutions tend to show weaker [O III] λ5007 emission, while older quasars exhibit stronger [O III] λ5007 emission.

<title>Contribution of the Cygnus Bubble to the Galactic Cosmic Ray Spectrum and Diffuse γ-Ray Emissions</title>

Since the discovery of cosmic rays (CRs) over a century ago, their origin has remained a mystery and a key research question. Recently, the LHAASO experiment identified the first CR superacceleration source, the Cygnus bubble, which can accelerate CRs to energies exceeding 10 PeV. A pertinent question is how much the Cygnus bubble contributes to the CR spectrum observed on Earth. With the aim of answering that question, a 3D propagation analysis was conducted on CRs in this study. The Cygnus bubble was incorporated into our propagation model in order to determine its contributions to the observed spectra. First, we calculated the spectrum and spatial morphology of the Cygnus bubble to reproduce the observed LHAASO data. Subsequently, we calculated the diffuse γ-ray emissions produced by the CRs from the Cygnus bubble and the energy spectrum of the CR particles near Earth after propagation. Finally, we utilized a CR spatial-dependent propagation model to calculate the large-scale CR energy spectrum and the resulting diffuse γ-ray emissions. Our results indicate that (1) the Cygnus bubble contributes minimally to the CR spectrum observed on Earth, (2) the emissions produced by the CR particles from the Cygnus bubble dominate the diffuse γ-ray emissions in that region, and (3) the structural fluctuations of the diffuse γ-ray emissions observed by LHAASO are likely due to the local CR halo. We anticipate that LHAASO will identify more CR halo sources to validate our model.

<title>Instability and Evolution of Shocked Clouds Formed by Orthogonal Collisions between Magnetized Filamentary Molecular Clouds</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Filamentary molecular clouds are recognized as primary sites for the formation of stars. Specifically, regions characterized by the overlapping point of multiple filaments, known as hub regions, are often associated with active star formation. However, the formation mechanism of this hub structure is not well understood. Therefore, to understand the formation mechanism and star formation in hub structures, as a first step, we investigate the orthogonal collisions between two filaments using three-dimensional ideal magnetohydrodynamical simulations. As a model of initial filaments, we use an infinitely long filament in magnetohydrostatic equilibrium under a global magnetic field running perpendicular to the filament axis. Two identical equilibrium filaments, sharing the same magnetic flux, are arranged with their long axes perpendicular to each other and given an initial velocity perpendicular to their long axes to replicate an orthogonal collision. We find three types of evolution after the shocked cloud is formed: collapse, stable, and expansion modes. The energy balance just after the filaments completely collide explains the future evolution of the shocked cloud. If the magnitude of gravitational energy is larger than the sum of the kinetic, thermal, and magnetic energies, the shocked cloud evolves in collapse mode. If the magnitude of gravitational energy is less than the sum of these energies, the cloud evolves in stable mode when the kinetic energy is relatively small and in expansion mode when the kinetic energy is sufficiently large.

Inspired by the entropy–area relation of black hole thermodynamics, we study the thermodynamics of the cosmological apparent horizon in a spatially flat Friedmann–Robertson–Walker universe in the framework of an extended uncertainty principle (EUP). The adopted EUP naturally admits a minimal measurable momentum (equivalently a maximal measurable length), as an infrared cutoff in the theory. We derive the modified Friedmann equations in this setup and explore some predictions of these equations for the late-time universe via distance measures. We show that in this framework it is possible to realize the late-time cosmic speedup and transition to the phantom phase of the equation-of-state parameter of the effective cosmic fluid without recourse to any dark energy component or modified gravity. Inspection of various distance measures in this framework shows that an EUP with a negative deformation parameter suffices for the interpretation of the late-time asymptotically de Sitter universe with standard nonrelativistic matter.

<div> Hα emission, stellar continuum, morphological analysis, specific star formation rate (sSFR), Merian Survey <br />
总结:<br />
本研究利用Merian Survey的中等波段成像，对处于0.064 < z < 0.1红移范围内的一组星系进行了非参数形态学分析。我们提出了一种新方法，通过Merian Survey的N708中等波段滤光片来估计恒星连续发射，用于测量Hα发射并为我们的样本星系生成Hα图。我们测量了Hα和恒星连续图像的非参数形态统计量，探讨了Hα的形态与连续图像的差异，并研究了这些参数随星系物理特性的演变。与先前针对更质量较大星系的结果一致，我们发现恒星连续的不对称性随特定星形成率（sSFR）增加而增加，并将这一趋势扩展到质量较低的星系，同时也表明这一趋势适用于Hα发射的不对称性。我们发现具有最高sSFR的质量最低的星系的Hα发射一致地表现出不均匀和紧凑，而在此质量范围内不太活跃的星系的Hα发射似乎 diffus。在更高质量的星系中，我们的数据范围不足以评估类似的趋势是否适用。我们得出结论，低质量星系中的高sSFR可能是由于动力学不稳定性导致星系的分子气体被压缩到中心附近的密集区域。 <div>
Using medium-band imaging from the newly released Merian Survey, we conduct a nonparametric morphological analysis of Hα emission maps and stellar continua for a sample of galaxies with at 0.064 < z < 0.1. We present a novel method for estimating the stellar continuum emission through the Merian Survey’s N708 medium-band filter, which we use to measure Hα emission and produce Hα maps for our sample of galaxies with seven-band Merian photometry and available spectroscopy. We measure nonparametric morphological statistics for the Hα and stellar continuum images, explore how the morphology of the Hα differs from the continuum, and investigate how the parameters evolve with the galaxies’ physical properties. In agreement with previous results for more massive galaxies, we find that the asymmetry of the stellar continuum increases with specific star formation rate (sSFR), and we extend the trend to lower masses, also showing that it holds for the asymmetry of the Hα emission. We find that the lowest-mass galaxies with the highest sSFR have Hα emission that is consistently heterogeneous and compact, while the less active galaxies in this mass range have Hα emission that appears diffuse. At higher masses, our data do not span a sufficient range in sSFR to evaluate whether similar trends apply. We conclude that high sSFRs in low-mass galaxies likely result from dynamical instabilities that compress a galaxy’s molecular gas to a dense region near the center.

解析模型用于解释星系中超新星遗迹的亮度和直径之间关系，在低密度气泡和多密度的环境中进行了模拟和分析。模型表明，超新星遗迹与多密度介质碰撞会导致亮度的增加，然后随着距离增加呈现更陡峭的下降趋势。模型分析还表明，多密度介质的影响在直径约为14 pc时开始显著，并会导致散射的观测数据。然而，还需要进一步分析选择效应，并改进模型以考虑辐射损失和热传导。

2. 多密度介质碰撞导致亮度增加和陡峭的下降趋势。

We present an analytical model of the Σ–D relation for supernova remnants (SNRs) evolving in a clumpy medium. The model and its approximations were developed using the hydrodynamic simulations of SNRs in environments of low-density bubbles and clumpy media with different densities and volume filling factors. For calculation of SNR luminosities we developed the synchrotron emission model, implying the test-particle approximation. The goal of this work is to explain the flattened part of the Σ–D relation for Galactic SNRs at D ≈ 14–50 pc. Our model shows that the shock collision with the clumpy medium initially enhances the brightness of individual SNRs, which is followed by a steeper fall of their Σ–D curve. We used the analytical model to generate large SNR samples on the Σ–D plane, within a span of different densities and distances to the clumpy medium, keeping the observed distribution of diameters. After comparison with the Galactic sample, we conclude that the observed Σ–D flattening and scatter originate in sporadic emission jumps of individual SNRs while colliding with the dense clumps. Statistically, the significant impact of the clumps starts at diameters of ≈14 pc, up to ∼70 pc, with the average density jump at the clumpy medium of ∼220 times, roughly depending on the low density of the circumstellar region. However, additional analysis considering the selection effects is needed, as well as improvement of the model, considering radiation losses and thermal conduction.

Here are analyzed 3D velocity distribution functions (VDFs) of protons in the suprathermal energy-per-charge (E/Q) domain of 6.2 to 223.1 keV/e, as observed by the WIND Suprathermal Ion Composition Spectrometer (WIND/STICS) between 1995 and 2019, upon passage of interplanetary (IP) shocks. “Suprathermal” designates energies above the bulk, “thermal” solar wind, including inner-source pickup ions, cometary ions, solar energetic particles, and suprathermal tail particles. Within the WIND/STICS measurements, here treated as a standalone data set, only 3D VDFs within 9 hr prior to and following the shock passage are selected, as identified by the Center for Astrophysics (CfA) Harvard Interplanetary Shock Database. These are subsequently averaged, first over the STICS field of view, then over 3 hr intervals in the 9 hr about the shock. The averages, with errors assuming Poisson statistics, are then fitted using the Levenburg–Marquardt nonlinear least squares technique to two simple, observationally suggested functions arising from diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) formalism: a power law in E/Q with spectral index (model I), and a power-law with exponential rollover having a cutoff in E/Q (model II). The first result is a comparison of upstream spectral indices, e-folding energies, and normalization constants with corresponding downstream values. The second is a comparison of fitted spectral indices against those given by measured CfA shock compression ratios and a comparison of fitted e-folding energies with those given by measured ratios and shock normal angles, per DSA-derived predictions. There is additionally a comparison between fitted parameters given by the two functional forms. Little agreement is found with values given by DSA.

We present the most precise measurements to date for the spatial extension and energy spectrum of the γ-ray region between a pulsar’s wind nebula and the interstellar medium, better known as the halo, present around Geminga and PSR B0656+14 (Monogem) using ∼2398 days of >1 TeV data collected by the HAWC observatory. We interpret the data using a physically motivated model for the diffuse γ-ray emission generated from positrons and electrons (e±) injected by the pulsar wind nebula and inverse Compton scattering with interstellar radiation fields. We find the morphologies of the regions inside these halos are characterized by an inhibited diffusion that are approximately three orders of magnitudes smaller than the Galactic average. We also obtain the e± emission efficiencies of 6.6% and 5.1%, respectively, for Geminga and Monogem. These results have remarkable consequences for the study of the particle diffusion in the region between the pulsar wind nebulae and the interstellar medium, and for the interpretation of the flux of positrons measured by the AMS-02 experiment above 10 GeV.

<div> geomagnetic storm, interplanetary data, magnetosonic shock, magnetic cloud, ionospheric current

总结:<br /><br />2024年5月10日至11日的超级风暴是太空时代第二大的地磁风暴，也是唯一一个有同时的行星间数据的风暴。风暴的特征是一个+88 nT的突发冲击（SI+），随后是一个持续约9小时的三步风暴主相发展。造成第一个风暴主相的原因是快速前进的行星间冲击和一个南向的行星间磁场成分。第二个风暴主相的原因是太空剪切的加深和磁声波的压缩。第三个也是最强烈的风暴主相是由磁场强度增强引起的。风暴期间的一些效应包括地磁暴引起的极区电流流动、高能电子和宇宙射线通量的变化以及强烈的电离层电流流动。 <div>
The recent superstorm of 2024 May 10–11 is the second largest geomagnetic storm in the space age and the only one that has simultaneous interplanetary data (there were no interplanetary data for the 1989 March storm). The May superstorm was characterized by a sudden impulse (SI+) amplitude of +88 nT, followed by a three-step storm main-phase development, which had a total duration of ∼9 hr. The cause of the first storm main phase with a peak SYM-H intensity of −183 nT was a fast-forward interplanetary shock (magnetosonic Mach number Mms ∼ 7.2) and an interplanetary sheath with a southward interplanetary magnetic field component Bs of ∼40 nT. The cause of the second storm's main phase with an SYM-H intensity of −354 nT was a deepening of the sheath Bs to ∼43 nT. A magnetosonic wave (Mms ∼ 0.6) compressed the sheath to a high magnetic field strength of ∼71 nT. Intensified Bs of ∼48 nT were the cause of the third and most intense storm main phase, with an SYM-H intensity of −518 nT. Three magnetic cloud events with Bs fields of ∼25–40 nT occurred in the storm recovery phase, lengthening the recovery to ∼2.8 days. At geosynchronous orbit, ∼76 keV to ∼1.5 MeV electrons exhibited ∼1–3 orders of magnitude flux decreases following the shock/sheath impingement onto the magnetosphere. The cosmic-ray decreases at Dome C, Antarctica (effective vertical cutoff rigidity <0.01 GV) and Oulu, Finland (rigidity ∼0.8 GV) were ∼17% and ∼11%, respectively, relative to quiet-time values. Strong ionospheric current flows resulted in extreme geomagnetically induced currents of ∼30–40 A in the subauroral region. The storm period is characterized by strong polar-region field-aligned currents, with ∼10 times intensification during the main phase and equatorward expansion down to ∼50° geomagnetic (altitude-adjusted) latitude.

本研究通过比较星体边缘和气体分布来研究星系的生长和环境影响。我们发现一些矮星系在围绕簇和场区域的Dstellar ≫ DHI的情况下，平均H i表面密度约为0.3 M⊙ pc−2，显示出压制和外部气体去除的影响。与之相比，在矮星系中Dstellar/DHI在0.5和2之间，与星体反馈的预期一致。我们还发现了Dstellar–M⋆关系在mbreak ∼ 4 × 108M⊙处发生了突变，这可能区分了低质量星系的影响。这些结果突显了结合深度光学和H i成像对理解星系演化的重要性。 <br /><br /> <div>
Mapping stars and gas in nearby galaxies is fundamental for understanding their growth and the impact of their environment. This issue is addressed by comparing the stellar “edges” of galaxies Dstellar, defined as the outermost diameter where in situ star formation significantly drops, with the gaseous distribution parameterized by the neutral atomic hydrogen diameter measured at 1 M⊙ pc−2, DHI. By sampling a broad H i mass range 105M⊙ < MHI < 1011M⊙, we find several dwarf galaxies with MHI < 109M⊙ from the field and Fornax Cluster that are distinguished by Dstellar ≫ DHI. For the cluster dwarfs, the average H i surface density near Dstellar is ∼0.3 M⊙ pc−2, reflecting the impact of quenching and outside-in gas removal from ram pressure and tidal interactions. In comparison, Dstellar/DHI ranges between 0.5 and 2 in dwarf field galaxies, consistent with the expectations from stellar feedback. Only more massive disk galaxies in the field can thus be characterized by the common assumption that Dstellar ≲ DHI. We discover a break in the Dstellar–M⋆ relation at mbreak ∼ 4 × 108M⊙ that potentially differentiates the low-mass regime, where the influence of stellar feedback and environmental processes more prominently regulates the sizes of nearby galaxies. Our results highlight the importance of combining deep optical and H i imaging for understanding galaxy evolution.

总结:<br />
加拿大氢强度制图实验（CHIME）望远镜发现了12个非重复的快速射电暴（FRB）源。这些源被选自CHIME/FRB全阵列原始电压数据记录的数据库，其信噪比大且形态复杂。这些事件显示出各种独特的漂移现象，并具有微观结构特征。此外，报道了这些事件的极化特征，包括极化分数和法拉第旋转度量。这些爆发的形态特性与FRB辐射的相对论冲击和磁层模型以及通过离散电离等离子体结构的传播预测大致一致。我们还讨论了如何利用我们对形态学原型的改进理解来测试这些模型。 <div>
We present the discovery of 12 apparently nonrepeating fast radio burst (FRB) sources, detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) telescope. These sources, only one of which has been presented previously in the first CHIME/FRB catalog, were selected from a database comprising CHIME/FRB full-array raw voltage data recordings, based on their large signal-to-noise ratios and complex morphologies. Our study examines the time-frequency characteristics of these bursts, including drifting, microstructure, and periodicities. The events in this sample display a variety of unique drifting phenomenologies that deviate from the linear negative drifting phenomenon seen in many repeating FRBs, and motivate a possible new framework for classifying drifting archetypes. Additionally, we detect microstructure features of duration ≲50 μs in seven events, with some as narrow as ≃7 μs. We find no evidence of significant periodicities between subburst components. Furthermore, we report the polarization characteristics of seven events, including their polarization fractions and Faraday rotation measures (RMs). The observed ∣RM∣ values span a wide range of 17.24(2)–328.06(2) rad m−2, with apparent linear polarization fractions between 0.340(1) and 0.946(3). The morphological properties of the bursts in our sample appear broadly consistent with predictions from both relativistic shock and magnetospheric models of FRB emission, as well as propagation through discrete ionized plasma structures. We address these models and discuss how they can be tested using our improved understanding of morphological archetypes.

ALMA进行了1.2毫米波段的观测，发现IRAS16547-E和IRAS16547-W周围存在具有双锥结构的尘埃包层，受到热射电喷流的影响。观测还显示磁场向量与双锥包层的结构密切相关，极化分数约为2.0%。同时，分子线H13CO+和HN13C的速度梯度与磁场有很好的对应关系，可能追踪了分子流的空腔或在某些部分存在向内运动。研究还发现一些区域的磁场强度在2到6.1 mG之间。此外，CS(5−4)分子线的发射显示出多个流出空腔或驶向不同方向的弓形冲击波，其中一些似乎沿着西北-东南方向的热射电喷流运动。

The formation of the massive stars, and in particular, the role that the magnetic fields play in their early evolutionary phase is still far from being completely understood. Here, we present the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array 1.2 mm full polarized continuum and H13CO+(3−2), CS(5−4), and HN13C(3−2) line observations with a high angular resolution (∼0.″4 or 1100 au). In the 1.2 mm continuum emission, we reveal a dusty envelope surrounding the massive protostars, IRAS16547-E and IRAS16547-W, with dimensions of ∼10,000 au. This envelope has a biconical structure likely carved by the powerful thermal radio jet present in region. The magnetic field vectors follow very well the biconical envelope. The polarization fraction is ∼2.0% in this region. Some of these vectors seem to converge to IRAS 16547-E and IRAS 16547-W, the most massive protostars. Moreover, the velocity fields revealed from the spectral lines H13CO+(3−2) and HN13C(3−2) show velocity gradients with a good correspondence with the magnetic fields, which maybe are tracing the cavities of molecular outflows or maybe infalling in some parts. We derived a magnetic field strength in some filamentary regions that goes from 2 to 6.1 mG. We also find that the CS(5−4) molecular line emission reveals multiple outflow cavities or bow shocks with different orientations, some of which seem to follow the NW–SE radio thermal jet.

<div> PAH, dust emission, star formation rate, AKARI/Infrared Camera, galaxies
<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用AKARI/红外相机研究了多环芳烃（PAH）尘埃排放对宇宙星系中的星形成率的指标作用。通过观测443个星系的光谱并使用光谱诊断方法推断星系的星形成率。研究发现，PAH与24μm的Hα发射光度呈线性关系，但仅限于正常的星形“主序”星系。此外，研究还发现PAH星形成率密度（SFRD）与远红外的SFRD一致，在z∼1时比未校正的UV观测高一个数量级。在z∼1时，星爆星系对总SFRD的贡献超过主序星系，达到总SFRD的0.7以上。 <div>
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) dust emission has been proposed as an effective extinction-independent star formation rate (SFR) indicator in the mid-infrared, but this may depend on conditions in the interstellar medium. The coverage of the AKARI/Infrared Camera (IRC) allows us to study the effects of metallicity, starburst intensity, and active galactic nuclei on PAH emission in galaxies with fν (L18W) ≲ 19 AB mag. Observations include follow-up, rest-frame optical spectra of 443 galaxies within the AKARI North Ecliptic Pole survey that have IRC detections from 7 to 24 μm. We use optical emission line diagnostics to infer SFR based on Hα and [O ii]λλ3726, 3729 emission line luminosities. The PAH 6.2 μm and PAH 7.7 μm luminosities (L(PAH 6.2 μm) and L(PAH 7.7 μm), respectively) derived using multiwavelength model fits are consistent with those derived from slitless spectroscopy within 0.2 dex. L(PAH 6.2 μm) and L(PAH 7.7 μm) correlate linearly with the 24 μm dust-corrected Hα luminosity only for normal, star-forming “main-sequence” galaxies. Assuming multilinear correlations, we quantify the additional dependencies on metallicity and starburst intensity, which we use to correct our PAH SFR calibrations at 0 < z < 1.2 for the first time. We derive the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) per comoving volume from 0.15 ≲ z ≲ 1. The PAH SFRD is consistent with that of the far-infrared and reaches an order of magnitude higher than that of uncorrected UV observations at z ∼ 1. Starburst galaxies contribute ≳0.7 of the total SFRD at z ∼ 1 compared to main-sequence galaxies.

<div> 星系，尘埃颗粒，紫外反射星云，尘埃质量，环绕星系

总结:
本研究使用GALEX的近紫外线和远紫外线图像对551个近距离（D < 100 Mpc）的边缘盘星系进行了搜索，发现了广泛存在的星系外发射，其尺度高度为1-2.3千秒差距，大约有10%的（泛红的）流量在μB = 25等视星等/角秒²的B带等视等级之外。额外的发射在7%的个别星系中被探测到，另外三分之一的星系至少有5%的总流量在μB = 25等视等级/角秒²的B带等视星等之外在一个盘组件。额外的发射光度和颜色与反射星云一致，而不是恒星晕，并且表明平均而言，盘状星系的星系外尘埃质量为其星际介质质量的5%-15%。这表明，回收材料至少占了∼L*星系内部星系环境介质（R < 10 kpc）的三分之一。 <div>
Circumgalactic dust grains trace the circulation of mass and metals between star-forming regions and gaseous galactic halos, giving insight into feedback and tidal stripping processes. We perform a search for ultraviolet (UV) reflection nebulae produced by extraplanar dust around 551 nearby (D < 100 Mpc), edge-on disk galaxies using archival near-ultraviolet and far-ultraviolet images from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), accounting for the point-spread function (FWHM = 4″–5″). We detect extraplanar emission ubiquitously in stacks of galaxies binned by morphology and star formation rate, with scale heights of hh = 1–2.3 kpc and ≈10% of the total (reddened) flux in the galaxy found beyond the B-band isophotal level of μB = 25 mag arcsec−2. This emission is detected in 7% of the individual galaxies, and an additional one-third have at least 5% of their total flux found beyond μB = 25 mag arcsec−2 in a disk component. The extraplanar luminosities and colors are consistent with reflection nebulae rather than stellar halos and indicate that, on average, disk galaxies have an extraplanar dust mass of 5%–15% of that in their interstellar medium. This suggests that recycled material composes at least a third of the inner circumgalactic medium (R < 10 kpc) in ∼L* galaxies.

<br />总结:<br />本研究使用高频监测数据和XMM-Newton观测结果，首次检测到了源自内部吸积流的软滞后现象。此外，同时测量了X射线回波和UVOIR盘吸收的时间滞后，有效地绘制了黑洞周围整个吸积盘的图像。研究发现低时间频率产生的UVOIR时间滞后要比标准吸积盘吸收预期的时间滞后长2-3倍。模拟滞后需额外约束的再处理，与Hβ滞后测量结果一致。当将光曲线分成不同部分时，UVOIR滞后表现出明显的变化，当离子化流的遮挡最严重时，滞后最大，我们推测此时BLR的再处理会显著延长滞后。随着风的减弱，滞后会受到较短的吸积盘滞后的主导。 <div>
X-ray reverberation mapping is a powerful technique for probing the innermost accretion disk, whereas continuum reverberation mapping in the UV, optical, and infrared (UVOIR) reveals reprocessing by the rest of the accretion disk and broad-line region (BLR). We present the time lags of Mrk 817 as a function of temporal frequency measured from 14 months of high-cadence monitoring from Swift and ground-based telescopes, in addition to an XMM-Newton observation, as part of the AGN STORM 2 campaign. The XMM-Newton lags reveal the first detection of a soft lag in this source, consistent with reverberation from the innermost accretion flow. These results mark the first simultaneous measurement of X-ray reverberation and UVOIR disk reprocessing lags—effectively allowing us to map the entire accretion disk surrounding the black hole. Similar to previous continuum reverberation mapping campaigns, the UVOIR time lags arising at low temporal frequencies are longer than those expected from standard disk reprocessing by a factor of 2–3. The lags agree with the anticipated disk reverberation lags when isolating short-timescale variability, namely timescales shorter than the Hβ lag. Modeling the lags requires additional reprocessing constrained at a radius consistent with the BLR size scale inferred from contemporaneous Hβ-lag measurements. When we divide the campaign light curves, the UVOIR lags show substantial variations, with longer lags measured when obscuration from an ionized outflow is greatest. We suggest that, when the obscurer is strongest, reprocessing by the BLR elongates the lags most significantly. As the wind weakens, the lags are dominated by shorter accretion disk lags.

<div> 超巨星，质量损失，MESA，赤色超巨星，蓝色超巨星
总结:
这篇文章讨论了大质量恒星中可能存在的喷发性质量损失机制，该机制与恒星外层的超Eddington光度相关。研究者在MESA星演化模拟中实现了这个1D模型，并发现质量损失可达每年约10^-2太阳质量。研究指出，这种喷发性质量损失可能导致质量大于20太阳质量的恒星不再演化为红超巨星，而是变成蓝超巨星，从而解释了观测到的这一质量范围内红超巨星的缺失。 <div>
Eruptive mass loss in massive stars is known to occur, but the mechanism(s) are not yet well understood. One proposed physical explanation appeals to opacity-driven super-Eddington luminosities in stellar envelopes. Here, we present a 1D model for eruptive mass loss and implement this model in the MESA stellar evolution code. The model identifies regions in the star where the energy associated with a local super-Eddington luminosity exceeds the binding energy of the overlaying envelope. The material above such regions is ejected from the star. Stars with initial masses of 10−100 M⊙ at solar and SMC metallicities are evolved through core helium burning, with and without this new eruptive mass-loss scheme. We find that eruptive mass loss of up to ∼10−2M⊙yr−1 can be driven by this mechanism, and occurs in a vertical band on the H-R diagram between . This predicted eruptive mass loss prevents stars of initial masses ≳20 M⊙ from evolving to become red supergiants (RSGs), with the stars instead ending their lives as blue supergiants, and offers a possible explanation for the observed lack of RSGs in that mass regime.

总结:
本研究使用FLASH代码进行三维宇宙射线磁流体动力学模拟，预测了端对端活跃星系核喷流充气泡的射电形态，考虑了强子发射。我们发现，强大且持续时间较长的CRp主导喷流可以在质量较低的暗物质团中产生类似大小（∼300–600 kpc）和射电形态（圆形和边缘增亮）的ORCs气泡。在相同输入喷流能量的情况下，持续时间较长（因此功率较低）的喷流往往会产生较大的气泡，因为高功率喷流会产生强大的激波，带走了喷流能量的相当部分。由于效率高的强子碰撞在气泡和环境介质的界面上，自然产生了ORCs的边缘增亮特征。我们进一步讨论了射电亮度、X射线可检测性以及在星系演化背景下此类强AGN喷流的可能起源。我们得出结论，端对端CR主导的AGN气泡可能是ORCs形成的合理情景。 <br /><br /> <div>
Odd radio circles (ORCs) are newly discovered extragalactic radio objects with an unknown origin. In this work, we carry out three-dimensional cosmic-ray (CR) magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the FLASH code and predict the radio morphology of end-on active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet-inflated bubbles considering hadronic emission. We consider CR proton (CRp)-dominated jets as they tend to inflate oblate bubbles, promising to reproduce the large inferred sizes of the ORCs when viewed end-on. We find that powerful and long-duration CRp-dominated jets can create bubbles with similar sizes (∼300–600 kpc) and radio morphology (circular and edge-brightened) to the observed ORCs in low-mass (Mvir ∼ 8 × 1012 − 8 × 1013M⊙) halos. Given the same amount of input jet energy, longer-duration (thus lower-power) jets tend to create larger bubbles since high-power jets generate strong shocks that carry away a significant portion of the jet energy. The edge-brightened feature of the observed ORCs is naturally reproduced due to efficient hadronic collisions at the interface between the bubbles and the ambient medium. We further discuss the radio luminosity, X-ray detectability, and the possible origin of such strong AGN jets in the context of galaxy evolution. We conclude that end-on CR-dominated AGN bubbles could be a plausible scenario for the formation of ORCs.

<br />总结:<br />文章通过对科代坦纳勒和威尔逊山天文台的数据进行分析，研究了太阳黑子群的倾斜角度与下一个太阳周期参数之间的关系。主要发现可以总结为三点：（1）在衰减阶段，平均倾斜角与倾斜角散射之间的相关性统计上不显著；（2）在衰减阶段，六个测量量与下一个太阳周期的强度、振幅和上升阶段的持续时间呈显著负相关，并且与倾斜角散射有正相关：包括倾斜角的标准差、均方根倾斜角、倾斜角的绝对值的平均值、面积加权倾斜角的绝对值、纬度加权倾斜角的绝对值和面积和纬度加权倾斜角的绝对值；（3）衰减阶段的平均倾斜角、面积加权倾斜角、纬度加权倾斜角以及面积和纬度加权倾斜角与下一个太阳周期的强度、振幅和上升阶段的持续时间的相关性统计上不显著。这些发现表明，在衰减阶段倾斜角散射对太阳周期变化的调节起着至关重要的作用。 <div>
Based on the data from the Kodaikanal and Mount Wilson observatories, we investigate the relationships of the tilt angles of sunspot groups, including the mean tilt angle and the tilt-angle scatter, during the declining phase with the parameters of the next solar cycle (SC). The main findings are summarized in the following three points. (1) During the declining phase, the correlation between the mean tilt angle and the tilt-angle scatter is statistically insignificant. (2) Six quantities measured during the declining phase show significant anticorrelations with the strength and amplitude of the next SC and positive correlations with the duration of the ascending phase of the next SC: the standard deviation of the tilt angles, the rms tilt angle, the mean absolute value of the tilt angles, the area-weighted absolute value of the tilt angles, the latitude-weighted absolute value of the tilt angles, and the area- and latitude-weighted absolute value of the tilt angles. (3) The correlations of the mean tilt angle, the area-weighted tilt angle, the latitude-weighted tilt angle, and the area- and latitude-weighted tilt angle during the declining phase with the strength, amplitude, and duration of the ascending phase of the next SC are statistically insignificant. These findings demonstrate that the modulation of the parameters of the next SC by the tilt-angle scatter during the declining phase plays a vital role in regulating SC variability.

<div> 关键词: 主序序列，脉冲星，电子回旋激射辐射，磁层密度，星磁层结构
总结:
主序序列脉冲星是一种产生相干射电脉冲的磁早型恒星，其辐射机制为电子回旋激射辐射。这种辐射具有高指向性和窄带宽的特点，且极化度极高。本文通过对一颗后B型主序序列脉冲星HD 133880进行超宽带观测，并通过不同频率下脉冲到达时间的差异来提取等离子体分布信息，发现恒星磁层具有倾斜的盘状过密度，且密度主要集中在中等频率范围。这些结果支持了最近对于热恒星离心支撑磁层的密度模型，为早型恒星磁层操作提供了进一步的动机，并提供了对大尺度恒星磁层中电子回旋激射辐射现象的全面描述。 <div>
Main-sequence radio pulse emitters (MRPs) are magnetic early-type stars that produce coherent radio emission observed in the form of periodic radio pulses. The emission mechanism behind this is the electron-cyclotron maser emission (ECME). Among all kinds of magnetospheric emission, ECME is unique due to its high directivity and intrinsically narrow bandwidth. The emission is also highly circularly polarized and the sign of polarization is opposite for the two magnetic hemispheres. This combination of properties makes ECME highly sensitive to the three-dimensional structures in the stellar magnetospheres. This is especially significant for late-B and A-type magnetic stars that do not emit other types of magnetospheric emission such as Hα, the key probe used to trace magnetospheric densities. In this paper, we use an ultra-wideband observation (0.4–2 GHz) of a late B-type MRP HD 133880 to demonstrate how we can extract information on plasma distribution from ECME. We achieve this by examining the differences in pulse arrival times (“lags”) as a function of frequencies and qualitatively comparing those with lags obtained by simulating ECME ray paths in hot stars’ magnetospheres. This reveals that the stellar magnetosphere has a disk-like overdensity inclined to the magnetic equator with a centrally concentrated density that primarily affects the intermediate frequencies (400–800 MHz). This result, which is consistent with the recent density model proposed for hotter centrifugally supported magnetospheres, lends support to the idea of a unifying model for magnetospheric operations in early-type stars, and also provides further motivation to fully characterize the ECME phenomenon in large-scale stellar magnetospheres.

<div> 高红移星系、He/H比率、局部矮星系、He过量、电子密度
总结:<br /><br />本文研究了三个红移较高的星系中He i/Hβ flux和He/H丰度比率，发现这些高红移星系表现出强烈的He i发射，He i/Hβ flux比率一般大于局部矮星系。对于高红移星系，He/H值大于0.10或电子密度ne ∼ 103−4 cm−3，远高于局部星系的值。作者发现He/H和N/O或ne–N/O平面间存在正相关关系。这表明高红移星系中的氦过量和氮过量无法用标准恒星爆炸的化学丰度来解释，而可能是由CNO循环产物和平衡比例所导致，或者是由于过多碰撞激发造成的。 <div>
We present He i/Hβ flux and He/H abundance ratios in three James Webb Space Telescope galaxies with significant constraints on N/O abundance ratios, GS-NDG-9422, RXCJ2248-ID, and GLASS150008 at z ∼ 6 mostly with the spectroscopic coverage from He iλ4471 and He iiλ4686 to He iλ7065, and comparing with 68 local dwarf galaxies. We find that these high-z galaxies present strong He i emission with He i/Hβ flux ratios generally larger than those of local dwarf galaxies. We derive He/H with all of the detected Hei, He ii, and 2−3 hydrogen Balmer lines in the same manner as the local He/H determination conducted for cosmology studies. These high-z galaxies show He overabundance He/H ≳0.10 or high electron density of ne ∼ 103−4 cm−3 much larger than local values at low O/H, . In contrast, we obtain low He/H and ne values for our local dwarf galaxies by the same technique with the same helium and hydrogen lines, and confirm that the difference between the high-z and local dwarf galaxies is not mimicked by systematics. While two scenarios of (1) He overabundance and (2) high electron density are not clearly concluded, we find that there is a positive correlation between the He/H–N/O or ne–N/O plane by the comparison of the high-z and local dwarf galaxies. Scenario (1) suggests that the overabundant helium and nitrogen are not explained by the standard chemical enrichment of core-collapse supernovae, but by the CNO-cycle products and equilibrium ratios, respectively. Scenario (2) indicates that the strong helium lines originated from the central dense clouds of the high-z galaxies by excessive collisional excitation.

<br /><br />总结: neutron star mergers产生r过程元素，GSE中出现了与[Mg/H]增加相关的[Eu/Mg]上升现象，化学演化模型表明这可能是由即时和延迟的r过程丰富事件相互作用造成的，未来需要更低金属贫瘠星的研究来了解GSE中r过程来源及其丰富过程。 <div>
Neutron star mergers (NSMs) produce r-process elements after a time-delayed inspiral process. Once a significant number of NSMs are present in a galaxy, r-process elements, such as Eu, are expected to significantly increase with time. Yet, there have been limited observational data in support of Eu increasing within Local Group galaxies. We have obtained high-resolution Magellan/MIKE observations of 43 metal-poor stars in the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus (GSE) tidally disrupted galaxy with −2.5 < [Fe/H] < −1. For the first time, we find a clear rise in [Eu/Mg] with increasing [Mg/H] within one galaxy. We use a simple chemical evolution model to study how such a rise can result from the interplay of prompt and delayed r-process enrichment events. Delayed r-process sources are required to explain the rise and subsequent leveling off of [Eu/Mg] in this disrupted galaxy. However, the rise may be explained by delayed r-process sources with either short (∼10 Myr) or long (∼500 Myr) minimum delay times. Future studies on the nature of r-process sources and their enrichment processes in the GSE will require additional stars in the GSE at even lower metallicities than the present study.

总结: 本文研究了R值变化与X级耀斑在太阳活动区的可能关系，采用Solar Dynamic Observatory的磁场数据进行推算，并在光球以上的区域计算R值。研究表明，在低太阳大气中存在潜在高度范围，即最佳高度范围（OHR），其中R值急剧增加。此外，对于新出现的AR，X级耀斑前的R值演变与非爆发性AR明显不同。对于非新出现的AR，无法找到OHR。这些发现有助于改进耀斑预测方法。 <br /><br /> <div>
The R-value is a measure of the strength of photospheric magnetic polarity inversion lines in active regions (ARs). This work investigates the possibility of a relation between R-value variations and the occurrence of X-class flares in ARs, not in the solar photosphere, as usual, but above it in regions closer to where flares occur. The modus operandi is to extrapolate the Solar Dynamic Observatory’s Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager magnetogram data up to a height of 3.24 Mm above the photosphere and then compute the R-value based on the extrapolated magnetic field. Recent studies have shown that certain flare-predictive parameters such as the horizontal gradient of the vertical magnetic field and magnetic helicity may improve flare prediction lead times significantly if studied at a specific height range above the photosphere, called the optimal height range (OHR). Here, we define the OHR as a collection of heights where a sudden but sustained increase in R-value is found. For the eight case studies discussed in this paper, our results indicate that it is possible for OHRs to exist in the low solar atmosphere (between 0.36 and 3.24 Mm), where R-value spikes occur 48–68 hr before the first X-class flare of an emerging AR. The temporal evolution of R-value before the first X-class flare for an emerging AR is also found to be distinct from that of nonflaring ARs. For X-class flares associated with nonemerging ARs, an OHR could not be found.

The first public 0.9–4.4 μm NIRCam images of the North Ecliptic Pole Time Domain Field uncovered galaxies displaying point-source features in their cores as seen in the longer-wavelength filters. We visually identified a sample of 66 galaxies (∼1 galaxy arcmin–2) with pointlike cores and have modeled their two-dimensional light profiles with GalFit, identifying 16 galactic nuclei with measurable point-source components. GalFit suggests that the visual sample is a mix of both compact stellar bulge and point-source galaxy cores. This core classification is complemented by spectral energy distribution modeling to infer the sample’s active galactic nucleus (AGN) and host-galaxy parameters. For galaxies with measurable point-source components, the median fractional AGN contribution to their 0.1–30.0 μm flux is 0.44, and 14/16 are color-classified AGN. We conclude that near-infrared point-source galaxy cores are signatures of AGN. In addition, we define an automated sample-selection criterion to identify these point-source features. This criterion can be used in other extant and future NIRCam images to streamline the search for galaxies with unresolved IR-luminous AGN. The James Webb Space Telescope’s superb angular resolution and sensitivity at infrared wavelengths are resurrecting the morphological identification of AGN.

通过MUSE Ultra Deep Field中的星系与两个明亮类星体的吸收线关联，探索星系特性对环星际介质中金属的依赖关系。研究利用超大望远镜（VLT）/MUSE数据和哈勃太空望远镜（HST）/G141M光栅观测，对两个类星体和几个波段的HST成像进行了比较。结果显示吸收线当量宽度与附近星系数量呈正相关，但在冲击参数方面没有显著的反相关。在全样本中，没有发现吸收体发生率随方位角的变化。然而，在小影响参数(<2 rvir)和高星形成星系周围的吸收角度分布呈双峰分布，这可能表明了盘状吸积和双锥出流。最后，没有发现吸收线星系对基本金属丰度关系的系统偏离。这项工作受当前数据波段覆盖范围的限制；使用James Webb太空望远镜的更广泛波长观测将允许我们充分发挥MUDF研究环星际介质的潜力。
<br /><br />总结: 本研究通过MUSE Ultra Deep Field对星系和环星际介质中金属吸收的关联进行了初步探讨，发现吸收线当量宽度与周围星系数量呈正相关，但冲击参数方面没有显著的反相关。在小影响参数和高星形成星系周围存在吸收角度分布的双峰现象，可能表明了盘状吸积和双锥出流。最后，未发现吸收线星系对基本金属丰度关系的系统偏离。 <div>
We present initial results associating galaxies in the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) Ultra Deep Field (MUDF) with gas seen in absorption along the line of sight to two bright quasars in this field to explore the dependence of metals in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) on galaxy properties. The MUDF includes ∼140 hr of Very Large Telescope (VLT)/MUSE data and 90 orbits of Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/G141M grism observations alongside VLT/Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph spectroscopy of the two quasars and several bands of HST imaging. We compare the metal absorption around galaxies in this field as a function of impact parameter, azimuthal angle, and galaxy metallicity across redshifts 0.5 < z < 3.2. Due to the depth of our data and a large field of view, our analysis extends to low stellar masses (<107M⊙) and high impact parameters (>600 kpc). We find a correlation between the absorber equivalent width and the number of nearby galaxies, but do not detect a significant anticorrelation with the impact parameter. Our full sample does not show any significant change in absorber incidence as a function of azimuthal angle. However, we do find a bimodality in the azimuthal angle distribution of absorption at small impact parameters (<2 rvir) and around highly star-forming galaxies, possibly indicating disk-like accretion and biconical outflows. Finally, we do not detect any systematic deviation from the fundamental metallicity relation among galaxies with detected absorption. This work is limited by gaps in the wavelength coverage of our current data; broader-wavelength observations with the James Webb Space Telescope will allow us to unlock the full potential of the MUDF for studying the CGM.

<title>On the Flux Density Spectral Property of High Linearly Polarized Signal from Pulsar J0332+5434</title>

<div> 关键词: 线偏振, 脉冲星, 磁化等离子体, 频率演变, 弯曲辐射<br />
总结: 
本文研究了来自PSR J0332+5434的高线偏振信号的频谱特性，使用了Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope对300至750 MHz的频率范围进行了观测。研究发现，高线偏振时间样本在很大程度上呈现出宽带的特性，在轮廓明显的区域有时呈现出窄而尖锐的特征。这些尖锐特征在整个频率范围内都局限在一个窄的脉冲经度内，并且它们的光谱形状有时呈倒置抛物线形状。在所有这些情况下，位置角偏振（PPA）仅沿着一个正交的RVM轨迹，可能对应于X模式。从理论上讲，倒置的光谱形状可以通过大量带电孤立子（电荷团）的相干加成引起的X模式的弯曲辐射来解释。 <div>
The polarization position angles (PPA) of time samples with high linear polarization often show two parallel tracks across the pulsar profile that follow the rotating vector model (RVM). This feature supports coherent curvature radiation (CCR) as the underlying mechanism of radio emission from pulsars, where the parallel tracks of the PPA represent the orthogonal extraordinary (X) and ordinary (O) eigenmodes of strongly magnetized pair plasma. However, the frequency evolution of these high linearly polarized signals remains unexplored. In this work, we explore the flux density spectral nature of high linearly polarized signals by studying the emission from PSR J0332+5434 over a frequency range between 300 and 750 MHz, using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. The pulsar average profile comprises a central core and a pair of conal components. We find the high linearly polarized time samples to be broadband in nature, and in many cases, they resemble a narrow spiky feature in the conal regions. These spiky features are localized within a narrow pulse longitude over the entire frequency range, and their spectral shapes sometimes resemble an inverted parabolic shape. In all such cases, the PPA is exclusively along one of the orthogonal RVM tracks, likely corresponding to the X-mode. The inverted spectral shape can, in principle, be explained if the high linearly polarized emission in these time samples is formed due to the incoherent addition of CCR from a large number of charged solitons (charge bunches) exciting the X-mode.

<div> 关键词: 模拟星系团、IllustrisTNG、MGS算法、星系超密度、halo identification

总结:
本文介绍了基于IllustrisTNG模拟的新型模拟星系团目录，使用MGS算法识别星系超密度。与以往的友邻法集群识别不同，本文的集群识别考虑了星系亚暗物质而非不可观测的暗物质粒子，并且采用MGS算法，能够有效分离由大质量星系托管的星系超密度。MGS目录列出了303个M200 > 1014M⊙的halos，比FoF目录多约10％。MGS目录的独立性能够识别出更多独立的大质量星系团halos，这有助于更好地评估MGS星系团对星系演化的影响，并且能够有效识别出合并星系团。因此，MGS星系团目录是研究宇宙学模拟中星系团及与观测星系团样本比较的有用工具。 <div>
We present a new simulated galaxy cluster catalog based on the IllustrisTNG simulation. We use the Mulguisin (MGS) algorithm to identify galaxy overdensities. Our cluster identification differs from the previous friends-of-friends (FoF) cluster identification in two aspects: (1) we identify cluster halos based on the galaxy subhalos instead of unobservable dark matter particles, and (2) we use the MGS algorithm, which separates galaxy overdensities hosted by massive galaxies. Our approach provides a cluster catalog constructed in a way similar to the construction of observed cluster catalogs using spectroscopic surveys. The MGS cluster catalog lists 303 halos with M200 > 1014M⊙, including ∼10% more than the FoF catalog. The MGS catalog includes more systems because we separate some independent massive MGS cluster halos that are bundled into a single FoF halo. These independent MGS halos are apparently distinguishable in the galaxy spatial distribution and the phase-space diagram. Because we construct a refined cluster catalog that identifies local galaxy overdensities, we evaluate the effect of MGS clusters on the evolution of galaxies better than when using the FoF cluster catalog. The MGS halo identification also enables effective identifications of merging clusters by selecting systems with neighboring galaxy overdensities. We thus highlight the fact that the MGS cluster catalog is a useful tool for studying clusters in cosmological simulations and for comparing with observed cluster samples.

<title>A Yebes W-band Line Survey towards an Unshocked Molecular Cloud of Supernova Remnant 3C 391: Evidence of Cosmic-Ray-Induced Chemistry</title>

本研究对3C391:NML分子云进行了详细的化学研究，发现它受宇宙射线影响较大。通过对18种分子进行观测和分析，发现了N(HCO+)/N(HOC+)比值较低，N(HCS+)/N(CS)比值较高，X(l-C3H+)更高。通过化学模型的研究发现，需要增强的宇宙射线电离率才能解释这些观测结果，这表明3C391:NML的宇宙射线电离率要比典型的分子云高2-3个数量级。作者指出分子云化学平衡并不一定已经达到，因此需要谨慎对待ζ的取值。 
<br /><br />总结: 通过对3C391:NML分子云进行分子观测和化学模型研究，发现它受到了强烈的宇宙射线影响，需要比典型分子云更高的宇宙射线电离率才能解释观测结果。 <div>
Cosmic rays (CRs) have strong influences on the chemistry of dense molecular clouds (MCs). To study the detailed chemistry induced by CRs, we conducted a Yebes W-band line survey towards an unshocked MC (which we named 3C391:NML) associated with supernova remnant 3C 391. We detected emission lines of 18 molecular species in total and estimated their column densities with local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE analysis. Using the abundance ratio N(HCO+)/N(CO) and an upper limit of N(DCO+)/N(HCO+), we estimated that the CR ionization rate of 3C391:NML is ζ ≳ 2.7 × 10−14 s−1 with an analytic method. However, we caution against adopting this value because chemical equilibrium, which is a prerequisite of using the equations, is not necessarily reached in 3C391:NML. We observed lower N(HCO+)/N(HOC+), higher N(HCS+)/N(CS), and higher X(l-C3H+) by an order of magnitude in 3C391:NML than the typical values in quiescent dense MCs. We found that an enhanced CR ionization rate (of order ∼10−15 or ∼10−14 s−1) is needed to reproduce the observation with a chemical model. This is higher than the values found in typical MCs by 2–3 orders of magnitude.

<div> gravitational waves, supermassive binary black holes, pulsar timing array, detection probability, GWB origin

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章探讨了超大质量双黑洞在脉冲星定时阵列实验中的引力波信号检测，以及对引力波背景和个体源的来源进行了研究。研究发现，如果检测到的引力波信号完全源自双黑洞，那么质量与宿主星系的红移演化需呈现显著正向趋势。同时，中国脉冲星定时阵列观测数据具有较高的个体双黑洞检测概率，并且即使双黑洞对引力波背景信号的贡献仅为10％，也有望在约10年的观测期内获得积极的检测结果。在未来数年内未能检测到个体双黑洞信号的情况下，结合已检测的引力波背景信号，可以对双黑洞对引力波背景信号的上限提出严格限制，并有助于确定/否定其宇宙起源。 <div>
The gravitational waves (GWs) from supermassive binary black holes (BBHs) have long been sought by pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments, in the forms of both a stochastic GW background (GWB) and individual sources. Evidence for a GWB was reported recently by several PTAs with origins to be determined. Here we use a BBH population synthesis model to investigate the detection probability of individual BBHs by the Chinese PTA (CPTA) and the constraint on the GWB origin that may be obtained by PTA observations of both GWB and individual BBHs. If the detected GWB signal is entirely due to BBHs, a significantly positive redshift evolution (∝ (1 + z)2.07) of the mass scaling relation between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies is required. In this case, we find that the detection probability of individual BBHs is ∼85% or 64% if using a period of 3.4 yr of CPTA observation data, with an expectation of ∼1.9 or 1.0 BBHs detectable with a signal-to-noise ratio ≥3 or 5, and it is expected to increase to >95% if the observation period is extended to 5 yr or longer. Even if the contribution from BBHs to the GWB power signal is as small as ∼10%, a positive detection of individual BBHs can still be expected within an observation period of ∼10 yr. A nondetection of individual BBHs within several years from now jointly with the detected GWB signal can put a strong constraint on the upper limit of the BBH contribution to the GWB signal and help identify/falsify a cosmological origin.

Nitrogen lines are widely observed in astrophysical spectra and provide important diagnostics for plasma properties. In this work, we present extended calculations for accurate energy levels, electric dipole radiative transition parameters, and lifetimes for the lowest 102 states of the 2s22p2, 2s2p3, 2s2p23s, 2s22p{n1l, n2d, 4f}(n1 = 3–5, l = s, p, n2 = 3, 4), and 2p4 configurations of N ii within the framework of the fully relativistic multiconfiguration Dirac–Hartree–Fock and relativistic configuration interaction methods. These data are useful for modeling astrophysical spectra, for example, for nitrogen abundance determinations in early B-type stars, and for studying the compositions and plasma properties of H ii regions and planetary nebulae. Our computed transition parameters are compared with available experimental and theoretical data. The accuracy of the calculations is also assessed via a statistical analysis of the differences between the transition rates in the Babushkin and Coulomb gauges and by consideration of cancellation factors. In this way, 201 of the 1656 transitions computed in this work are estimated to be from accurate to better than 3%, corresponding to an accuracy class of A.

The hydrogen recombination lines H30α, H40α, H42α, H50β, and H57γ and the underlying bremsstrahlung continuum emission were detected with ALMA in the bipolar nebula Mz3. The source was not spatially resolved, but the velocity profile of the H30α line shows clear indication of maser amplification, confirming previous reports of laser amplification in the far-infrared H recombination lines observed with Herschel Space Observatory. Comparison between the flux densities of the H50β, H40α, and H42α lines show overcooling, or darkness amplification by stimulated absorption (dasar effect) at the LSR velocity of about −25 km s−1, which constrains the density of the absorbing region to about 103 cm−3. The H30α line, on the other hand, presents maser lines at LSR velocities of −69 and −98 km s−1, which indicates ionized gas with densities close to 107 cm−3. Although the source of emission was not resolved, it was possible to find the central position of the images for each velocity interval, which resulted in a well defined position–velocity distribution.

总结: 
这项研究调查了NGC 1399球状星团中质量在102M⊙至105M⊙范围内的中间质量黑洞（IMBHs）的可检测性。研究使用了理论的邦迪吸积模型和黑洞吸积的经验基本平面（FP）来估计IMBH的质量，发现IMBH在射电频率300.00 MHz下是可探测的。通过对77个球状星团候选对象进行3小时观测，利用方阵平方公里阵列（Square Kilometre Array），成功识别出了表明IMBH吸积的射电探测基准。研究发现，NGC 1399中的球状星团内的IMBH是可检测到的，并且邦迪吸积模型提供IMBH质量估计为2.93 × 103.0±0.39M⊙至7.43 × 104.0±0.39M⊙，而经验FP关系则指出IMBH质量估计为3.41 × 105.0±0.96M⊙。这些发现强调了球状星团中IMBH的存在和可检测性，为IMBH作为超大质量黑洞的先导体的角色以及黑洞在天体物理环境中形成和演化的认识提供了新的见解。 <br /><br /> <div>
This study investigates the detectability of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) within the mass range 102M⊙ ≤ MBH ≤ 105M⊙ in the globular star clusters of NGC 1399 at a frequency of 300.00 MHz. Employing the theoretical Bondi accretion model and the empirical fundamental plane (FP) of black hole accretion, we estimate IMBH masses based on bolometric luminosity and X-ray/radio luminosities, respectively. By simulating a 3 hr observation of 77 globular cluster (GC) candidates using the Square Kilometre Array, we identify radio detection benchmarks indicative of accretion onto IMBHs. Our results show that IMBHs inside the globular star clusters located in NGC 1399 are indeed detectable, with the Bondi accretion model providing IMBH mass estimates ranging from 2.93 × 103.0±0.39M⊙ to 7.43 × 104.0±0.39M⊙ and the empirical FP relation suggesting IMBH mass estimation with 3.41 × 105.0±0.96M⊙. These findings highlight the presence and detectability of IMBHs in GCs, offering insights into their role as precursors to supermassive black holes and enriching our understanding of black hole formation and evolution in astrophysical environments.

<title>Anisotropic Heating and Cooling within Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection Sheath Plasma</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study presents the first comprehensive investigation of the relationship between heating and cooling, temperature anisotropy, turbulence level, and collisional age within interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) sheaths, which are highly compressed, heated, and turbulent. Using Wind spacecraft data, we analyze 333 ICME sheaths observed at 1 au from 1995 to 2015. The proton temperature within the ICME sheaths has a log-normal probability distribution. Irrespective of instability growth rates, plasma unstable to proton-cyclotron (PC) and firehose instabilities appear to be statistically hotter, at least by a factor of 5 to 10, compared to stable plasma. We also observe relatively enhanced magnetic fluctuations and low collisional age, especially in regimes unstable to PC and firehose instabilities at low proton betas βp ≤ 2. In the case of high beta βp ≥ 2, we observe high magnetic fluctuations close to the instabilities and less collisional age to the plasma unstable to firehose instability rather than near the mirror mode and PC threshold. Our findings suggest that heating processes dominate over cooling processes in producing proton temperature anisotropy in the ICME sheath region. Moreover, collisional age and magnetic fluctuations are critical in maintaining anisotropic and isotropic conditions.

A small fraction of fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been observed with multiple bursts, whereas most Galactic sources emitting radio pulses are known to repeat. Here we present the results of follow-up observations of two FRBs and four rotating radio transients (RRATs). Among these, only one RRAT has been observed with repeating pulses, with an estimated period of around 1.297047 s. For comparison, we reanalysed the Parkes archival follow-up observations in CSIRO’s data archive for all apparently one-off sources discovered by the Parkes telescopes, including 13 RRATs and 29 FRBs. In total, 3 RRATs are suggested to be repeaters, but no repeating signals were detected from the other sources. Reporting details of the nondetection observations for the apparently one-off sources would help investigate their origins, and catastrophic scenarios are worth proposing for both extragalactic and Galactic sources.

<div> 黑洞，相对论，磁化等离子体，吸积速率，光度曲线
总结：<br /><br />该研究使用相对论计算模拟了两个质量相等、不自旋的黑洞从20M初始距离几乎合并。研究结果表明，黑洞的吸积速率先下降，然后趋于稳定，在快速螺旋中仅下降了大约3倍。估计的全波光度曲线遵循相同的特征，这表明一些螺旋合并的超大质量双黑洞在预期的周围盘脱耦后可能具有显着的亮度。小盘是非标准的，雷诺应力主导，而不是麦克斯韦应力，并且在两种状态之间振荡。在循环的某个部分，“晃动”流会在小盘之间传输质量，以最大小盘全波光度的速率携带动能。我们还发现，周期性吸积驱动时间变化的小盘倾斜。这些复杂的动态都导致了螺旋合并超大质量双黑洞光度曲线的独特周期性行为。黑洞的极轴磁通大致上保持在ϕ∼2-3的无量纲水平上，但在合并前突然增加一倍；对于有显著自旋的黑洞来说，这样的磁通预测了由二元动力学驱动的具有变化性的强喷流，这是另一个潜在独特的电磁特征。这项模拟是第一个使用多块基础设施PatchworkMHD的，降低了计算成本，约为传统单网格方法的3％。 <div>
While supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs) inspiral toward merger they may also accrete matter from a surrounding disk. To study the dynamics of this system requires simultaneously describing the evolving spacetime and the magnetized plasma. We present the first relativistic calculation simulating two equal-mass, nonspinning black holes as they inspiral from a 20 M (G = c = 1) initial separation almost to merger. Our results imply important observational consequences: for instance, the accretion rate onto the black holes first decreases and then plateaus, dropping by only a factor of ∼3 despite the rapid inspiral. An estimated bolometric light curve follows the same profile, suggesting some merging SMBBHs may be significantly luminous past the predicted circumbinary disk decoupling. The minidisks are nonstandard: Reynolds, not Maxwell, stresses dominate, and they oscillate between two states. In one part of the cycle, “sloshing” streams transfer mass between minidisks, carrying kinetic energy at a rate sometimes as high as the peak minidisk bolometric luminosity. We also discover that episodic accretion drives time-varying minidisk tilts. These complex dynamics all contribute to unique cyclical behavior in the light curves of late-time inspiraling SMBBHs. The poloidal magnetic flux on the black holes is roughly constant at a dimensionless level ϕ ∼ 2–3, but doubles just before merger; for significant black hole spin, this flux predicts powerful jets with variability driven by binary dynamics, another potentially unique electromagnetic signature. This simulation is the first to employ our multipatch infrastructure PatchworkMHD, decreasing the computational expense to ∼3% of conventional single-grid methods’ cost.

For each event, the spacecraft with the best magnetic connection to the source region among the three spacecraft was identified, and energetic proton intensities observed by the spacecraft were analyzed through fitting. The fitting process produced two parameters, b and c, for four energy channels (13–16 MeV, 20–25 MeV, 32–40 MeV, and 40–64 MeV) in each event. Parameters b and c govern the rise and decay of particle intensities, respectively. Statistical analysis revealed a power-law correlation between b and c, expressed as c ∼ b−γ. In this study, in order to explain the relation between the two parameters, we investigate the model of particle diffusion coefficients in the interplanetary space. In our simulations, the radial mean free path is modeled as a power function of radial distance, successfully reproducing the b–c relation. Consequently, the observations demonstrate that the radial mean free path varies with radial distance in a power law. In future research, the model of diffusion coefficients holds promise in determining the mean free path of energetic protons.

总结:<br />
本研究使用多时段最大似然估计（MLE）方法分析了附近超新星遗迹（SNR）的十年变化。通过整合运动特征和点扩散函数效应到MLE框架中，提高了捕捉SNR动态的准确性。利用卡西奥佩拉A作为代表性示例，使用Chandra X射线天文台在2000年、2009年和2019年获取的数据。该方法定性和定量地证明了对所有区域的冲击波和微弱特征等各种运动提供了准确估计。为了研究不对称结构，MLE方法扩展到结合多个计算域，并使用k-means算法对运动属性进行分类。这种方法允许将不同的物理状态映射到图像上，并通过与James Webb太空望远镜的红外观测进行比较，推测出一个分类的组分与星周物质相互作用。因此，这项技术将有助于量化SNR的动态并发现它们独特的演变。 <div>
Decadal changes in a nearby supernova remnant (SNR) were analyzed using a multiepoch maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach. To achieve greater accuracy in capturing the dynamics of SNRs, kinematic features and point-spread function effects were integrated into the MLE framework. Using Cassiopeia A as a representative example, data obtained by the Chandra X-ray Observatory in 2000, 2009, and 2019 were utilized. The proposed multiepoch MLE was qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrated to provide accurate estimates of various motions, including shock waves and faint features, across all regions. To investigate asymmetric structures, such as singular components that deviate from the direction of expansion, the MLE method was extended to combine multiple computational domains and classify kinematic properties using the k-means algorithm. This approach allowed for the mapping of different physical states onto the image, and one classified component was suggested to interact with circumstellar material by comparison with infrared observations from the James Webb Space Telescope. Thus, this technique will help quantify the dynamics of SNRs and discover their unique evolution.

<div> X-ray survey, Stripe 82, spectroscopic redshifts, Type 1 AGN, black hole masses<br />总结:<br />本研究发布了Stripe 82 X射线调查的第三个目录，结合了先前发表的X射线源特性、多波长对应物和光度红移，提供了343个新的光谱红移，并为1297个1型活动星系核（AGN）提供了黑洞质量。调查的光谱完整性为56％，在光学星等极限r < 22的Stripe 82X调查连续部分上升至90％。AGN中有23％被认为是被遮挡的，与其他调查不同，1型和X-ray遮挡的AGN只有18％的重叠。我们发现，具有最高X射线光度的AGN正在以最高爱丁顿比例进行吸积，这与大部分黑洞质量吸积发生在AGN明亮阶段的图像一致。我们还发现黑洞质量估计存在较大散布，应使用统一的公式计算黑洞质量以最小化偏见。 <div>
We present the third catalog release of the wide-area (31.3 deg2) Stripe 82 X-ray survey. This catalog combines previously published X-ray source properties with multiwavelength counterparts and photometric redshifts, presents 343 new spectroscopic redshifts, and provides black hole masses for 1297 Type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGN). With spectroscopic redshifts for 3457 out of 6181 Stripe 82X sources, the survey has a spectroscopic completeness of 56%. This completeness rises to 90% when considering the contiguous portions of the Stripe 82X survey with homogeneous X-ray coverage at an optical magnitude limit of r < 22. Within that portion of the survey, 23% of AGN can be considered obscured by being either a Type 2 AGN, reddened (R − K > 4, Vega), or X-ray obscured with a column density of NH > 1022 cm−2. Unlike other surveys, there is only an 18% overlap between Type 2 and X-ray obscured AGN. We calculated black hole masses for Type 1 AGN that have Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra using virial mass estimators calibrated on the Hβ, Mg ii, Hα, and C iv emission lines. We find wide scatter in these black hole mass estimates, indicating that statistical analyses should use black hole masses calculated from the same formula to minimize bias. We find that the AGN with the highest X-ray luminosities are accreting at the highest Eddington ratios, consistent with the picture that most black hole mass accretion happens in the phase when the AGN is luminous (L2−10keV > 1045 erg s−1).

总结: 
声速上限是核物质的平方声速的最大值，本研究通过多信使观测和非参数方法重构的方程状态证实了这一上限。观测数据表明，声速上限与中子星质心附近物质的性质一致，这与pQCD驱动的因果约束相符。另外，结果显示声速上限与核物质密度之间存在明显相关性，而当密度达到临界值时，这种相关性被违反。最新的联合约束结果显示中子星的半径和质量的范围。这些研究结果通过两个独立约束的一致性，进一步证实了它们的有效性。 <br /><br /> <div>
Very recently, it has been shown that there is an upper bound on the squared sound speed of nuclear matter from the transport, which reads . In this work, we demonstrate that this upper bound is corroborated by the reconstructed equation of state (EOS; modeled with a nonparametric method) for ultradense matter. The reconstruction integrates multimessenger observation for neutron stars, in particular, the latest radius measurements for PSR J0437–4715 ( km), PSR J0030+0451 ( km, in the ST+PDT model), and PSR J0740+6620 ( km) by NICER have been adopted. The result shows in all cases, the upper limit for EOS will naturally yield the properties of matter near the center of the massive neutron star consistent with the causality-driven constraint from pQCD, where, in practice, the density in implementing the pQCD likelihood (nL) is applied at (where is the nuclear saturation density). We also note that there is a strong correlation for the maximum cs2 with nL, and is somehow violated when nL = nc,TOV. The result indicates that a higher nL, even considering the uncertainties from statistics, is more natural. Moreover, the remarkable agreement between the outcomes derived from these two distinct and independent constraints (i.e., the transport calculation and pQCD boundary) lends strong support to their validity. In addition, the latest joint constraint for R1.4, R2.0, R1.4 − R2.0, and MTOV are km, km, km, and (at 90% credible level), respectively.

<div> 关键词: 星体形成率，NGC 1068，分子气体盘，H ii 区域，数值模拟

总结: 
本研究针对近邻塞费尔特星系NGC 1068，利用新的高灵敏度Atacama大型毫米/亚毫米阵列100 GHz连续数据，结合哈勃空间望远镜Paα线数据，提出了NGC 1068分子气体盘的星体形成率（SFR）校准。校准过程中考虑了尘埃消光、H ii 区域的电子温度、AGN污染和扩散电离气体（DIG）的空间变化。经过修正后，NGC 1068盘的总SFR估计为3.2 ± 0.5 M⊙ yr−1。研究还发现南部条状结束和共转半径周围存在高SFR，与先前的SFR测量结果相一致。此外，研究指出基于8μm尘埃发射的总SFR与实际SFR存在差异，这是由于不同追踪器追踪到不同阶段演化的年轻恒星和各自的时间尺度。这项研究提供了一个案例，来解决传统SFR测量中的各种不确定性及其可能导致重大SFR误差的潜在问题。 <div>
The star formation rate (SFR) is a fundamental parameter for describing galaxies and inferring their evolutionary course. H ii regions yield the best measure of instantaneous SFR in galaxies, although the derived SFR can have large uncertainties depending on tracers and assumptions. We present an SFR calibration for the entire molecular gas disk of the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, based on our new high-sensitivity Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array 100 GHz continuum data at 55 pc (= 0.″8) resolution in combination with the Hubble Space Telescope Paα line data. In this calibration, we account for the spatial variations of dust extinction, electron temperature of H ii regions, AGN contamination, and diffuse ionized gas (DIG) based on publicly available multiwavelength data. Especially, given the extended nature and the possible nonnegligible contribution to the total SFR, a careful consideration of DIG is essential. With a cross-calibration between two corrected ionized gas tracers (free–free continuum and Paα), the total SFR of the NGC 1068 disk is estimated to be 3.2 ± 0.5 M⊙ yr−1, one-third of the SFR without accounting for DIG (9.1 ± 1.4 M⊙ yr−1). We confirmed a high SFR around the southern bar end and the corotation radius, which is consistent with the previous SFR measurements. In addition, our total SFR exceeds the total SFR based on 8 μm dust emission by a factor of 1.5. We attribute this discrepancy to the differences in the young stars at different stages of evolution traced by each tracer and their respective timescales. This study provides an example to address the various uncertainties in conventional SFR measurements and their potential to lead to significant SFR miscalculations.

<div> TDEs, radio follow-up, ASKAP, late-time emission, optical discovery
Summary:
Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are increasingly being detected at radio wavelengths, challenging existing models for radio emission. A study using data from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) detected late-time emission in five TDEs, including the independent discovery of radio emission from TDE AT 2019ahk. The study finds that at least a portion of optically discovered TDEs has detectable radio emission, and projects that the ongoing ASKAP Variable and Slow Transients survey can detect approximately 20 TDEs in its operational span. This suggests that late-time radio activity is common to a broad class of TDEs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
Late-time (∼a year) radio follow-up of optically discovered tidal disruption events (TDEs) is increasingly resulting in detections at radio wavelengths, and there is growing evidence for this late-time radio activity to be common to the broad class of subrelativistic TDEs. Detailed studies of some of these TDEs at radio wavelengths are also challenging the existing models for radio emission. Using all-sky multiepoch data from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), taken as a part of the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS), we searched for radio counterparts to a sample of optically discovered TDEs. We detected late-time emission at RACS frequencies (742–1032 MHz) in five TDEs, reporting the independent discovery of radio emission from TDE AT 2019ahk and extending the time baseline out to almost 3000 days for some events. Overall, we find that at least of the population of optically discovered TDEs has detectable radio emission in the RACS survey, while also noting that the true fraction can be higher given the limited cadence (two epochs separated by ∼3 yr) of the survey. Finally, we project that the ongoing higher-cadence (∼2 months) ASKAP Variable and Slow Transients survey can detect ∼20 TDEs in its operational span (4 yr), given the current rate from optical surveys.

总结:
星际物质的形成是一个高度动态的过程，连接了从星系尺度的千秒巨泡到百帕尔赛克尺度的巨型分子云和星团的丝状层次结构，并受到超新星的反馈影响。通过多尺度的MHD模拟，可以追踪从星系尺度到亚秒尺度的结构形成过程。模拟表明，气体的吸积与压缩最终驱动了丝状结构形成巨型分子云和星团。在安静的区域，星系剪切可以产生扁平的旋转盘状结构内的丝状巨型分子云。模拟结果还展示了与这些盘状结构形成相关的螺旋磁场的形成。 <br /><br /> <div>
There is now abundant observational evidence that star formation is a highly dynamical process that connects filament hierarchies and supernova feedback from galaxy-scale kiloparsec filaments and superbubbles to giant molecular clouds (GMCs) on 100 pc scales and star clusters (1 pc). Here we present galactic multiscale MHD simulations that track the formation of structure from galactic down to subparsec scales in a magnetized, Milky Way–like galaxy undergoing supernova-driven feedback processes. We do this by adopting a novel zoom-in technique that follows the evolution of typical 3 kpc subregions without cutting out the surrounding galactic environment, allowing us to reach 0.28 pc resolution in the individual zoom-in regions. We find a wide range of morphologies and hierarchical structures, including superbubbles, turbulence, and kiloparsec atomic gas filaments hosting multiple GMC condensations that are often associated with superbubble compression, down to smaller-scale filamentary GMCs and star cluster regions within them. Gas accretion and compression ultimately drive filaments over a critical, scale-dependent line mass leading to gravitational instabilities that produce GMCs and clusters. In quieter regions, galactic shear can produce filamentary GMCs within flattened, rotating disklike structures on 100 pc scales. Strikingly, our simulations demonstrate the formation of helical magnetic fields associated with the formation of these disklike structures.

总结: 
这项研究利用James Clerk Maxwell Telescope SCUBA-2 850 μm连续波数据对G35分子复合体中的细丝和宿主团进行了系统研究。研究发现复合体内有五个云，其中包含91条细丝，其中一些形成了10个枢纽-细丝系统，每个系统至少有三条枢纽组成的细丝。此外，研究编制了一个包含350个密集团的目录，其中183个与细丝相关。   进一步调查了细丝和团的物理特性，如质量、密度和大小，以及它们与恒星形成的关系。研究发现，细丝的全局质量-长度趋势与湍流起源一致，而HFSs中线质量高（ml > 230 M⊙ pc−1）的枢纽组成细丝偏离了这一关系，可能是由于大质量恒星形成的反馈作用。同时发现，在细丝和HFSs的枢纽中，最大质量和最密集的团（R > 0.2 pc，M > 35 M⊙，Σ > 0.05 g cm−2）出现频率更高，突出了HFSs对于高质量恒星形成的优先地点。研究还发现，在云的不同进化环境中团的质量表面密度变化不大，这可能反映了质量吸积和恒星反馈之间的平衡。 <div>
Filaments are believed to play a key role in high-mass star formation. We present a systematic study of the filaments and their hosting clumps in the G35 molecular complex using James Clerk Maxwell Telescope SCUBA-2 850 μm continuum data. We identified five clouds in the complex and 91 filaments within them, some of which form 10 hub–filament systems (HFSs), each with at least three hub-composing filaments. We also compiled a catalog of 350 dense clumps, 183 of which are associated with the filaments. We investigated the physical properties of the filaments and clumps, such as mass, density, and size, and their relation to star formation. We find that the global mass–length trend of the filaments is consistent with a turbulent origin, while the hub-composing filaments of high line masses (ml > 230 M⊙ pc−1) in HFSs deviate from this relation, possibly due to feedback from massive star formation. We also find that the most massive and densest clumps (R > 0.2 pc, M > 35 M⊙, Σ > 0.05 g cm−2) are located in the filaments and in the hubs of HFSs, with the latter bearing a higher probability of the occurrence of high-mass star-forming signatures, highlighting the preferential sites of HFSs for high-mass star formation. We do not find significant variation in the clump mass surface density across different evolutionary environments of the clouds, which may reflect the balance between mass accretion and stellar feedback.

这项研究分析了一个稀有群体，即具有显著H i气体的强凸显型早型星系（sBDEs）的特性，使用了FAST全天H i巡天（FASHI）和阿雷西博遗产快速ALFA（ALFALFA）巡天的数据库。通过从斯隆数字化天空巡天中选择sBDEs，并与FASHI-ALFALFA组合的H i样本进行交叉匹配，得到了104个H i丰富的sBDEs。这些sBDEs倾向于具有极高的H i储库，这在以前的研究中很少见，比如ATLAS3D。选择的sBDEs中总共70%被分类为平静的星系，尽管它们具有大量的H i储库。我们从四个主要方面研究了这些sBDEs的特性：恒星群，气相金属丰度，堆积的H i光谱和环境。绝大多数H i丰富的sBDEs似乎显示出较低的气相金属丰度，并且位于明显较低密度的环境中，这表明它们的H i气体具有外部起源。我们发现，有星形成的sBDEs表现出统计上更高的星形成效率，稍微较老的恒星群，相比于正常的有星形成的星系，这表明在数十亿年的时间尺度上有最近的星形成。与对照有星形成的星系相比，它们也显示出更窄和更集中的H i轮廓，这可能解释了它们更高的星形成效率。

3. H i丰富的sBDEs表现出较低的气相金属丰度

We analyze the properties of a rare population, the strongly bulge-dominated early-type galaxies (sBDEs) with significant H i gas, using the databases from the FAST All Sky H i survey (FASHI) and the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey. We select the sBDEs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and crossmatch with the FASHI-ALFALFA combined H i sample, resulting in 104 H i-rich sBDEs. These sBDEs tend to have extremely high H i reservoirs, which is rare in previous studies such as ATLAS3D. A total of 70% of the selected sBDEs are classified as quiescent galaxies, even though they have a large H i reservoir. We study the properties of these sBDEs from four main aspects: stellar population, gas-phase metallicity, stacked H i spectra, and environment. The majority of H i-rich sBDEs appear to show lower gas-phase metallicity and are located in significantly lower-density environments, suggesting an external origin for their H i gas. We find that star-forming sBDEs exhibit statistically higher star formation efficiency and slightly older stellar populations compared to normal star-forming galaxies, suggesting a recent star formation on the Gyr timescale. They also show narrower and more concentrated H i profiles compared to control star-forming galaxies, which may explain their higher star formation efficiency.

The gradient technique is a promising tool with theoretical foundations based on the fundamental properties of MHD turbulence and turbulent reconnection. Its various incarnations use spectroscopic, synchrotron, and intensity data to trace the magnetic field and measure the media magnetization in terms of Alfvén Mach number. We provide an analytical theory of gradient measurements and quantify the effects of averaging gradients along the line of sight and over the plane of the sky. We derive analytical expressions that relate the properties of gradient distribution with the Alfvén Mach number MA. We show that these measurements can be combined with measures of sonic Mach number or line broadening to obtain the magnetic field strength. The corresponding technique has advantages to the Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi way of obtaining the magnetic field strength.

总结:<br />
文章介绍了Perseus Cluster中冷前沿的形成模拟研究。研究发现，低质量的亚团不能产生能够传播到如此大半径的冷前沿，而小的冲击参数会引起太多湍流，导致冷前沿在到达较大距离前被破坏。只有进行一次核心通过的亚团能产生一个稳定的冷前沿，并在后来的时间里扩展到较大半径，但是在核区域没有在后来的时间形成其他前沿。研究发现，质量比为R∼1:5且初始冲击参数为θ∼20°–25°的亚团产生了大的冷前沿，并在后来的时间在核心区域产生了第二组冷前沿。这些模拟表明，“古老”的冷前沿的年龄约为6–8.5亿年。对于观测结果提供了最接近匹配的模拟来说，亚团已经完全并入主团。 <div>
The intracluster medium of the Perseus Cluster exhibits spiral-shaped X-ray surface brightness discontinuities known as “cold fronts,” which simulations indicate are caused by the sloshing motion of the gas after the passage of a subcluster. Recent observations of Perseus have shown that these fronts extend to large radii. In this work, we present simulations of the formation of sloshing cold fronts in Perseus using the AREPO magnetohydrodynamics code, to produce a plausible scenario for the formation of the large front at a radius of 700 kpc. Our simulations explore a range of subcluster masses and impact parameters. We find that low-mass subclusters cannot generate a cold front that can propagate to such a large radius, and that small impact parameters create too much turbulence, which leads to the disruption of the cold front before it reaches such a large distance. Subclusters that make only one core passage produce a stable initial front that expands to large radii, but without a second core passage of the subcluster, other fronts are not created at a later time in the core region. We find a small range of simulations with subclusters with mass ratios of R ∼ 1:5 and an initial impact parameter of θ ∼ 20°–25° that not only produce the large cold front but a second set in the core region at later times. These simulations indicate that the “ancient” cold front is ∼6–8.5 Gyr old. For the simulations providing the closest match with observations, the subcluster has completely merged into the main cluster.

The origin of fast flux variability in blazars is a long-standing problem, with many theoretical models proposed to explain it. In this study, we focus on BL Lacertae to model its spectral energy distribution (SED) and broadband light curves using a diffusive shock acceleration process involving multiple mildly relativistic shocks, coupled with a time-dependent radiation transfer code. BL Lacertae was the target of a comprehensive multiwavelength monitoring campaign in early 2021 July. We present a detailed investigation of the source’s broadband spectral and light-curve features using simultaneous observations at optical–UV frequencies with the Swift Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope, in X-rays with the Swift X-Ray Telescope and AstroSat-SXT/LAXPC, and in gamma rays with Fermi-LAT, covering the period from 2021 July to August (MJD 59400–59450). A fractional variability analysis shows that the source is most variable in gamma rays, followed by X-rays, UV, and optical. This allowed us to determine the fastest variability time in gamma rays to be on the order of a few hours. The AstroSat-SXT and LAXPC light curves indicate X-ray variability on the order of a few kiloseconds. Modeling simultaneously the SEDs of low- and high-flux states of the source and the multiband light curves provided insights into the particle acceleration mechanisms at play. This is the first instance of a physical model that accurately captures the multiband temporal variability of BL Lacertae, including the hour-scale fluctuations observed during the flare.

<div> 关键词: 三维磁场、CN (N = 1–0) 发射线、尘埃连续辐射、磁场强度、高质量恒星形成区
总结:
本文对六个高质量恒星形成区使用了Taeduk射电天文台14米望远镜观测的CN (N = 1–0)数据和来自Herschel存档的尘埃连续数据，以测试CN线和尘埃连续辐射是否可以追踪相似的区域，并因此可用于推断三维磁场强度。通过比较所有目标的CN和H2柱密度，发现CN线发射倾向于强烈的连续区域。在所有目标中，峰值CN柱密度的位置与峰值H2柱密度的位置特别良好地相关，至少在一个或两个天文望远镜波束尺度内的H2柱密度为8.0×1022cm−2以上，这意味着CN线和尘埃连续辐射区域很可能在空间上重合。这使我们能够通过对其BLOS和BPOS进行矢量求和，可靠地测量出五个目标的三维磁场强度，有助于确定目标的磁致密性为超临界或跨临界。<br /><br /> <div>
Measuring the strength of a three-dimensional (3D) magnetic field vector is challenging as it is not easy to recognize whether its line-of-sight (LOS) and plane-of-sky (POS) components are obtained from the same region. CN (N = 1–0) emission has been used to get the LOS component of a magnetic field (BLOS) from its Zeeman splitting lines, while dust continuum emission has been used to get the POS component of a magnetic field (BPOS). We use the CN (N = 1–0) data observed with the Taeduk Radio Astronomy Observatory 14 m telescope and the dust continuum data from the Herschel archive toward six high-mass star-forming regions in order to test whether CN line and dust continuum emission can trace a similar region and thus can be used for inferring 3D magnetic field strength. Our comparison between CN and H2 column densities for all targets indicates that CN line emission tends to be strong toward bright continuum regions. The positions of peak CN column densities are particularly well correlated with those of peak H2 column densities, at least over the H2 column density of 8.0 × 1022 cm−2 within one or two telescope beam sizes in all targets, implying that CN-line- and dust-continuum-emitting regions are likely spatially coincident. This enabled us to make the reliable measurement of the 3D magnetic field strengths of five targets by taking a vector sum of their BLOS and BPOS, helping to decide the magnetical criticality of the targets as supercritical or transcritical.

<div> 关键词: 黑洞合并, 环形信号, 强场引力动力学, 时间域分析, 参数估计<br />
总结: <br />这篇论文介绍了一种新的时间域方法，用于分析黑洞合并后的环形信号。该方法通过重新配置似然函数并在所有模式的幅度和参考相位上进行解析最大化，实现了参数空间保持恒定，从而大大缩短了参数估计计算时间。传统的时间域方法在包括多个高次谐波模式时变得困难，而这种新方法则有效解决了这个问题。这个新的时间域方法对当前和未来的引力波探测器都具有广泛的研究适用性，并为黑洞频谱学的各种主题提供了灵活性。 <div>
After the final stage of the merger of two black holes (BHs), the ringdown signal takes an important role in providing information about the gravitational dynamics in strong field. We introduce a novel time-domain (TD) approach, predicated on the -statistic, for ringdown analysis. This method diverges from traditional TD techniques in that its parameter space remains constant irrespective of the number of modes incorporated. This feature is achieved by reconfiguring the likelihood and analytically maximizing over the extrinsic parameters that encompass the amplitudes and reference phases of all modes. Consequently, when performing the ringdown analysis under the assumption that the ringdown signal is detected by the Einstein Telescope, the parameter estimation computation time is shortened by at most 5 orders of magnitude compared to the traditional TD method. We further establish that traditional TD methods become difficult when including multiple overtone modes due to close oscillation frequencies and damping times across different overtone modes. Encouragingly, this issue is effectively addressed by our new TD technique. The accessibility of this new TD method extends to a broad spectrum of research and offers flexibility for various topics within BH spectroscopy applicable to both current and future gravitational wave detectors.

<div> 关键词: Massive star-forming regions, hub-filament systems, cloud–cloud collision, magnetohydrodynamic simulation, turbulence

总结: 
近期观测研究表明，云团之间的碰撞可能与枢纽-丝状系统的形成有关。研究人员分析了云团碰撞的磁流体力学模拟数据，发现碰撞会在压缩层内形成丝状结构并驱动内部气流。这些气流在锥体的顶点汇聚，迅速聚集高密度气体，最终可能形成大质量恒星。PV图表明了气流朝着锥体顶点的流动，而磁场形态则朝着碰撞的方向弯曲。要注意的是，如果碰撞的云团大小差异较大，则在位置-速度和位置-位置空间中检测两个云团并确认它们的互补分布可能存在挑战。 <div>
Massive star-forming regions (MSFRs) are commonly associated with hub-filament systems (HFSs) and sites of cloud–cloud collision (CCC). Recent observational studies of some MSFRs suggest a possible connection between CCC and the formation of HFSs. To understand this connection, we analyzed the magnetohydrodynamic simulation data from Inoue et al. This simulation involves the collision of a spherical turbulent molecular cloud with a plane-parallel sea of dense molecular gas at a relative velocity of about 10 km s−1. Following the collision, the turbulent and nonuniform cloud undergoes shock compression, rapidly developing filamentary structures within the compressed layer. We found that CCC can lead to the formation of HFSs, which is the combined effect of turbulence, shock compression, magnetic field, and gravity. The collision between the cloud components shapes the filaments into a cone and drives inward flows among them. These inward flows merge at the vertex of the cone, rapidly accumulating high-density gas, which can lead to the formation of massive star(s). The cone acts as a mass-collecting machine, involving a nongravitational early process of filament formation, followed by gravitational gas attraction to finalize the HFS. The gas distribution in the position–velocity (PV) and position–position spaces highlights the challenges in detecting two cloud components and confirming their complementary distribution if the colliding clouds have a large size difference. However, such CCC events can be confirmed by the PV diagrams presenting gas flow toward the vertex of the cone, which hosts gravitationally collapsing high-density objects, and by the magnetic field morphology curved toward the direction of the collision.

<div> 巨型星系, 化学丰度数据, 银河系, 矮星系, 化学丰度模型

总结:<br /><br />这项研究使用了“两过程模型”来解释银河系和矮星系的恒星化学丰度数据，从而实现了对星系之间化学丰度历史差异的定量经验研究。研究发现，虽然矮星系的元素丰度模式存在着较大的变化，但是两过程框架能够准确地刻画它们之间许多元素的丰度模式，而这些多元素模式在矮星系卫星和银河系盘片之间存在着系统性差异。文章探讨了此差异的起源，强调了银河系盘片可能经历了大量原始气体的流入，稀释了形成星体的金属丰度，但没有改变元素丰度比。 <div>
The “two-process model” is a promising technique for interpreting stellar chemical abundance data from large-scale surveys (e.g., the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV/V and the Galactic Archeology with HERMES survey), enabling more quantitative empirical studies of differences in chemical enrichment history between galaxies without relying on detailed yield and evolution models. In this work, we fit two-process model parameters to (1) a luminous giant Milky Way (MW) sample and (2) stars comprising the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr). We then use these two sets of model parameters to predict the abundances of 14 elements of stars belonging to the MW and in five of its massive satellite galaxies, analyzing the residuals between the predicted and observed abundances. We find that the model fit to (1) results in large residuals (0.1–0.3 dex) for most metallicity-dependent elements in the metal-rich ([Mg/H] > −0.8) stars of the satellite galaxies. However, the model fit to (2) results in small or no residuals for all elements across all satellite galaxies. Therefore, despite the wide variation in [X/Mg]–[Mg/H] abundance patterns of the satellite galaxies, the two-process framework provides an accurate characterization of their abundance patterns across many elements, but these multielement patterns are systematically different between the dwarf galaxy satellites and the MW disks. We consider a variety of scenarios for the origin of this difference, highlighting the possibility that a large inflow of pristine gas to the MW disk diluted the metallicity of star-forming gas without changing abundance ratios.

The Press–Schechter (PS) and excursion set (ES) models of structure formation fail in reproducing the halo bias found in simulations, while the ES-peaks' formalism built in the peak model reproduces it only at high masses and does not address in a fully satisfactory manner peak nesting, and the mass and time of ellipsoidal collapse of triaxial peaks in the Gaussian-smoothed density field. Here, we apply the confluent system of peak trajectories formalism fixing all these issues from first principles and with no free parameters to infer the Lagrangian local peak bias parameters, which adopt very simple analytic expressions similar to those found in the PS and ES models. The predicted Eulerian linear halo bias recovers the results of simulations. More specifically, we show that the only small departure observed at intermediate and low masses can be due to the spurious halo splitting and grouping caused by the spherical overdensity halo-finding algorithm used in simulations.

<br /><br />总结: 这篇论文研究了极端红移夸脱星系的X射线特性，并发现它们通常被高速氧三离子发出的气流所伴随，可能代表了强烈的反馈作用。研究表明，这些ERQs被重度遮蔽，X射线辐射较弱，并且显示出更高速度的气体流动。这一发现可能表明X射线辐射较弱有助于产生更强劲的气体流动，从而影响星系的演化。另外，这些现象也可能与超艾登顿吸积有关。 <div>
Quasar feedback is a key ingredient in shaping galaxy evolution. A rare population of extremely red quasars (ERQs) at z = 2−3 are often associated with high-velocity [O iii]λ5008 outflows and may represent sites of strong feedback. In this paper, we present an X-ray study of 50 ERQs to investigate the link between the X-ray and outflow properties of these intriguing objects. Using hardness ratio analysis, we confirm that the ERQs are heavily obscured systems with gas column density reaching NH = 1023−24 cm−2. We identify 20 X-ray-nondetected ERQs at high mid-infrared (MIR) luminosities of νLν,6 μm ≳ 3 × 1046 erg s−1. By stacking the X-ray observations, we find that the nondetected ERQs are on average underluminous in X-rays by a factor of ∼10 for their MIR luminosities. We consider such X-ray weakness to be due to both heavy gas absorption and intrinsic factors. Moreover, we find that the X-ray-weak sources also display higher-velocity outflows. One option to explain this trend is that weaker X-rays facilitate more vigorous line-driven winds, which then accelerate the [O iii]-emitting gas to kiloparsec scales. Alternatively, super-Eddington accretion could also lead to intrinsic X-ray weakness and more powerful continuum-driven outflow.

How do galaxies of different luminosities contribute to the metal absorber populations of varying species and strength? We present our analysis of the predicted metal contributions from galaxies as observed in quasar absorption line spectra during the end of the epoch of reionization (10 ≥ z ≥ 5.5). This was done by implementing on-the-fly particle tracking into the latest Technicolor Dawn simulation and then linking C ii, C iv, Si ii, Si iv, O i, and Mg ii absorbers to host galaxies in postprocessing. We define the host galaxy luminosity distribution (HGLD) as the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity distribution of galaxies contributing ions to an absorber, weighted by the fractional contribution, and compute its dependence on ion and absorber strength. The HGLD shape is predicted to be indistinguishable from the field luminosity function, indicating that there is no relationship between the absorber strength or ion and the luminosity of the dominant contributing galaxy. Switching from galaxy luminosity to stellar mass, the predicted host galaxy mass distributions (HGMDs) indicate that more-massive galaxies contribute a higher fraction of metal ions to absorbers of each species, with the HGMDs of stronger absorbers extending out to higher masses. We conclude that the fraction of absorbing metal ions contributed by galaxies increases weakly with stellar mass, but the scatter in luminosity at fixed stellar mass obscures this relationship. For the same reason, we predict that observational analyses of the absorber–galaxy relationship will uncover stronger trends with stellar mass than with luminosity.

本研究利用时间序列极限精度光谱观测、脉冲星定时和银河系太阳附近的脉冲星定时和星相交叉脉冲双星的加速度测量，来对银河系的质量分布进行研究。通过测量得到的加速度，可以确定总质量密度，并推断出暗物质的含量。研究使用了FIRE-2模拟对银河系质量的宇宙学模型进行了比较，并观察到了在CDM和SIDM中的垂直加速度剖面的显著不对称性。结果显示，SIDM的暗物质晕呈现出更扁平的形状，并且在太阳附近的区域中具有更高的局部恒星和暗物质密度，以及更陡的垂直加速度梯度。然而，相似的幅度变化也可能来自于在固定半径处的星系盘组分的方位变化和外部影响等因素，使得单个星系中的加速度测量很难区分CDM和SIDM。

Measurements of the accelerations of stars enabled by time-series extreme-precision spectroscopic observations, pulsar timing, and eclipsing binary stars in the solar neighborhood offer insights into the mass distribution of the Milky Way that do not rely on traditional equilibrium modeling. Given the measured accelerations, we can determine a total mass density and infer the amount of dark matter (DM) by accounting for the mass in stars, gas, and dust. Leveraging FIRE-2 simulations of Milky Way–mass galaxies we compare vertical acceleration profiles between cold DM (CDM) and self-interacting DM (SIDM) with a constant cross section of 1 cm2 g−1 across three halos with diverse assembly histories. Notably, significant asymmetries in vertical acceleration profiles near the midplane at fixed radii are observed in both CDM and SIDM, particularly in halos recently affected by mergers with satellites of Sagittarius/SMC-like masses or greater. These asymmetries offer a unique window into exploring the merger history of a galaxy. We show that SIDM halos manifest a more oblate shape and consistently exhibit higher local stellar and DM densities and steeper vertical acceleration gradients, up to 10%–30% steeper near the solar neighborhood. However, similar magnitude changes can arise from azimuthal variations in the baryonic components at a fixed radius and external influences like mergers, making it difficult to distinguish between CDM and SIDM using acceleration measurements in a single galaxy.

太阳活动是由太阳大气中积累的磁能释放所引起的。为了了解其物理机制，必须研究日冕磁场的动力学。然而，由于缺乏直接测量，主导机制仍不清楚。基于磁流体力学（MHD）的数值模拟可以复制太阳日冕磁场的动态演化，提供了一个探索耀斑起源的有用工具。基于观测数据的MHD模拟可以探索不同的机制。通过使用光球磁场的时间序列观测数据作为模拟边界条件，我们对NOAA活动区11283中的几次大型耀斑进行了模拟。我们使用了零beta MHD控制的数据驱动模型，重点关注M5.3耀斑（2011年9月6日01:59 UT）前的自由磁能积累。我们再现了与耀斑相关的喷发，随着扭曲磁场或磁通绳（MFR）的形成，并受其足点处的光球运动的影响。我们发现，喷发首先是由挽稳定性的增长触发的。喷发的MFR通过与喷发方向上的邻近磁场线的磁重联导致了喷发。利用模拟结果和以MFR为中心的轴向-径向衰减指数，我们找到了喷发倾斜的自然解释，并可能预测太阳喷发事件的方向的方法。

Solar energetic events are caused by the release of magnetic energy accumulated in the solar atmosphere. To understand their initiating physical mechanisms, the dynamics of the coronal magnetic fields must be studied. Unfortunately, the dominant mechanisms are still unclear due to a lack of direct measurements. Numerical simulations based on magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) can reproduce the dynamical evolution of solar coronal magnetic field, providing a useful tool to explore flare initiation. Data-driven MHD simulations, in which the time-series observational data of the photospheric magnetic field is used as the simulation boundary condition, can explore different mechanisms. To investigate the accumulation of free magnetic energy through a solar eruption, we simulated the first of several large flares in NOAA active region 11283. We used a data-driven model that was governed by zero-beta MHD, focusing on the free magnetic energy accumulation prior to the M5.3 flare (2011 September 6 at 01:59 UT). We reproduced the flare-associated eruption following the formation of twisted magnetic fields, or a magnetic flux rope (MFR), formed by photospheric motions at its footpoints. We found that the eruption was first triggered by the growth of the torus instability. The erupting MFR caused magnetic reconnections with neighboring magnetic field lines located along the direction of the eruption. Using the simulation results and an axial-radial decay index centered on the MFR, we find a natural explanation for the inclination of the eruption and a possible approach to predict the direction of solar eruptive events.

We compute the gaseous dynamical friction force experienced by massive perturbers on elliptical Keplerian orbits. Using linear perturbation theory, we investigate the density wake morphology, dynamical friction force, and secular orbital evolution for massive single perturbers as well as equal-mass binaries embedded in a homogeneous, static medium. In all cases, the rate of change in the semimajor axis is found to be negative (as expected), whereas the rate of change in eccentricity is negative for strictly subsonic trajectories and positive for strictly supersonic trajectories. Transonic orbits can experience both positive and negative torques during the course of an orbit, with some growing in eccentricity and others circularizing. We observe all initial orbits becoming highly supersonic and eccentric (over sufficiently long timescales) due to a relentless semimajor axis decay increasing the Mach number and subsequent eccentricity driving. We compare our findings to previous studies for rectilinear and circular motion while also making our data for the evolution of Keplerian orbits available.

We present a study of asteroseismically derived surface gravities, masses, and radii of a sample of red giant stars both with and without confirmed planetary companions using TESS photometric light curves. These red giants were drawn from radial velocity surveys, and their reported properties in the literature rely on more traditional methods using spectroscopy and isochrone fitting. Our asteroseismically derived surface gravities achieved a precision of ∼0.01 dex; however, they were on average ∼0.1 dex smaller than the literature. The systematic larger gravities of the literature could plausibly present as a systematic overestimation of stellar masses, which would in turn lead to overestimated planetary masses of the companions. We find that the fractional discrepancies between our asteroseismically determined parameters and those previously found are typically larger for stellar radii (∼10% discrepancy) than for stellar masses (<5% discrepancy). However, no evidence of a systematic difference between methods was found for either fundamental parameter. Two stars, HD 100065 and HD 18742, showed significant disagreement with the literature in both mass and radii. We explore the impacts of updated stellar properties on inferred planetary properties and caution that red giant radii may be more poorly constrained than uncertainties suggest.

<div> 关键词: 快速射电暴、中子星、小行星带、轨道配置、轨道偏心率

中子星和小行星带之间的重复FRBs问题一直让人们费解。一种观点认为，重复的FRBs可能是由中子星与小行星带之间的相互作用产生的。本文中，我们研究了围绕大质量恒星存在小行星带的系统，并且中子星作为大质量恒星的伴星，通过引力相互作用与小行星带发生作用。我们假设了各种不同的轨道配置，并进行了直接N体模拟来研究小行星带的动力学演化。我们发现，中子星的轨道离心率越大，小行星带就会更快地被摧毁，大量小行星将被散射出系统。低倾角不仅抑制了碰撞，而且在早期阶段还抑制了小行星的抛射率。然而，高倾角系统可能会经历强烈的振荡，导致科萨伊-李多夫不稳定。在各种配置中，我们观察到了在轨道离心率为0.7且相互倾角为0°的情况下碰撞事件的明显周期性。我们发现，这种周期性至少可以在八个中子星轨道周期内持续存在，支持了这种机制是解释周期性重复FRB的可能性。我们的研究还表明，这种FRB源的活跃阶段应该是有限的，因为小行星带最终会被中子星摧毁。 <br /><br />总结: 本文研究了中子星和小行星带之间的相互作用，发现中子星的轨道参数对小行星带的演化有着重要的影响。我们观察到了在特定轨道配置下碰撞事件的周期性，这可能解释了重复FRB的现象。另外，我们也发现这种类型的FRB源的活跃期是有限的，因为小行星带最终会被摧毁。 <div>
Some fast radio bursts (FRBs) exhibit repetitive behaviors, and their origins remain enigmatic. It has been argued that repeating FRBs could be produced by the interaction between a neutron star and an asteroid belt. Here, we consider the systems in which an asteroid belt dwells around a massive star, while a neutron star, as a companion of the massive star, interacts with the belt through gravitational force. Various orbital configurations are assumed for the system. Direct N-body simulations are performed to investigate the dynamical evolution of the asteroids' belt. It is found that a larger orbital eccentricity of the neutron star will destroy the belt more quickly, with a large number of asteroids being scattered out of the system. A low inclination not only suppresses the collisions but also inhibits the ejection rate at early stages. However, highly inclined systems may undergo strong oscillations, resulting in the Kozai–Lidov instabilities. Among the various configurations, a clear periodicity is observed in the collision events for the case with an orbital eccentricity of 0.7 and mutual inclination of 0◦. It is found that such a periodicity can be sustained for at least eight neutron star orbital periods, supporting this mechanism as a possible explanation for periodically repeating FRBs. Our studies also suggest that the active stage of these kinds of FRB sources should be limited, since the asteroid belt would finally be destroyed by the neutron star after multiple passages.

<div> 黑洞自旋，磁层流动，磁层扭曲，内部直立激波，数值模拟
总结：<br /><br />本研究通过三维广义相对论磁流体动力学模拟，探讨了与黑洞自旋轴不一致的磁层流动特性。结果显示，磁层呈现扭曲的稳定结构，外部磁层偏离黑洞轴线，接近黑洞附近存在直立激波。内部磁层与黑洞自旋轴部分一致，且随着半径的增加逐渐趋于一致。研究还提出了轨道拥挤的玩具模型，用于预测在中到快速自转的黑洞中激波的位置，这可能在确定实际不一致的天体系统中激波位置方面具有潜在的物理应用。 <div>
We carry out idealized three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of prograde, weakly magnetized, and geometrically thick accretion flows where the gas distribution is misaligned from the black hole (BH) spin axis. We evolve the disk for three BH spins: a = 0.5, 0.75, and 0.9375, and we contrast them with a standard aligned disk simulation with a = 0.9375. The tilted disks achieve a warped and twisted steady-state structure, with the outer disk misaligning further away from the BH and surpassing the initial 24° misalignment. However, closer to the BH, there is evidence of partial alignment, as the inclination angle decreases with radius in this regime. Standing shocks also emerged in proximity to the BH, roughly at ∼6 gravitational radii. We show that these shocks act to partially align the inner disk with the BH spin. The rate of alignment increases with increasing BH spin magnitude, but in all cases is insufficient to fully align the gas before it accretes. Additionally, we present a toy model of orbit crowding that can predict the location of the shocks in moderate-to-fast rotating BHs, illustrating a potential physical origin for the behavior seen in simulations—with possible applications in determining the positions of shocks in real misaligned astrophysical systems.

We develop a theoretical framework and use 2D hydrodynamical simulations to study the repulsive effect between two close orbiters embedded in an accretion disk. We consider orbiters on fixed Keplerian orbits with masses low enough to open shallow gaps. The simulations indicate that the repulsion is larger for more massive orbiters and decreases with the orbital separation and the disk’s viscosity. We use two different assumptions to derive theoretical scaling relations for the repulsion. A first scenario assumes that each orbiter absorbs the angular momentum deposited in its horseshoe region by the companion’s wake. A second scenario assumes that the corotation torques of the orbiters are modified because the companion changes the underlying radial gradient of the disk surface density. We find a substantial difference between the predictions of these two scenarios. The first one fails to reproduce the scaling of the repulsion with the disk viscosity and generally overestimates the strength of the repulsion. The second scenario, however, gives results that are broadly consistent with those obtained in the simulations.

在这项研究中，我们分析了自1997年至2024年间Advance Composition Explorer太空飞船观测到的80个3He丰富太阳高能粒子事件的光谱特性。我们将光谱分析分为两个标准：伴有快速和广泛日冕物质喷射的事件（称为“FW事件”）和伴有缓慢、狭窄或无日冕物质喷射的事件（称为“非FW事件”）。总的来说，我们发现伴有快速和广泛日冕物质喷射的事件在所有种类的粒子中表现出更均匀的光谱，并且它们的低能谱指数强烈相关，这表明日冕物质喷射提供了一种额外的3He丰富太阳高能粒子的再加速机制。此外，当比较没有与快速和广泛日冕物质喷射相关的事件中每种粒子的低能谱指数时，我们发现3He的谱硬度存在主要峰值，而Mg和Si存在次要峰值。最后，我们提出额外的再加速和/或传输机制可能在Fe和更重的离子的丰度增强中发挥作用，这也是需要进一步研究的问题。<br /><br />总结: 该研究总结了80个3He丰富太阳高能粒子事件的光谱特性分析，发现了日冕物质喷射对粒子再加速的影响，同时也观察到了3He、Mg和Si的谱硬度的不同峰值。此外，对Fe和更重离子的丰度增强提出了需要进一步研究的假设。 <div>
We analyze the spectral properties of 3He and 4He as well as the heavy ions (oxygen, neon, magnesium, silicon, and iron) in 80 3He-rich solar energetic particle (SEP) events observed by the Ultra-Low-Energy Ion Spectrometer on board the Advanced Composition Explorer spacecraft since its launch in 1997 until 2024. We split the spectral analysis into two criteria: events with fast and wide coronal mass ejections (CMEs; called “FW events”) and events with slow, narrow, or no observed CMEs (called “non-FW events”). Overall, we find that events with fast and wide CMEs exhibit more uniform spectra across all species, and their low-energy spectral indices are strongly correlated, suggesting a CME provides an additional reacceleration mechanism for the 3He-rich SEPs. When comparing each species’ low-energy spectral index for events with no associated fast-and-wide CME, we find a primary peak in the spectral hardness of 3He, and a secondary peak in Mg and Si. If we consider a plasma temperature of 1.0–1.3 MK, Mg and Si have a charge-to-mass ratio (Q/M) nearest to one-third (1/3), directly half that of 3He. Thus, our results support the results of Roth & Temerin, which suggest heavy ions resonate with the second harmonic of the same ion cyclotron waves energizing 3He. However, it is unclear why the Fe enhancement is not reflected in its spectral index, and we propose that additional acceleration and/or transport mechanisms are playing a role in the abundance enhancement of Fe and heavier ions.

<div> 边界层，剪切不稳定性，冷却速率，波动传播，质量和角动量传输
<br /><br />该研究调查了在一系列热力学条件下这些系统的动态，包括盘的声速和冷却速率。快速和缓慢冷却几乎不影响波动动力学。然而，当冷却时间与波周期相当时，波阻尼变得极端。在冷却速率中等的情况下，质量和角动量传输可以比等温和未冷却的情况下抑制几个数量级。盘中的冷却导致对接近和低于盘马赫数的波数的偏好；对应的较低频率可以与星内的重力模式耦合，在吸积系统中可能驱动低频变化，如矮新星和准周期振荡。
<br /><br />总结: 边界层的剪切不稳定性在盘向行星、恒星、白矮星和中子星的加速过程中起主导作用。冷却速率对波动动力学具有显著影响，当冷却时间与波周期相当时，波阻尼变得极端。较低频率的波动可以与星内的重力模式耦合，可能导致吸积系统中的低频变化。 <div>
In many cases accretion proceeds from disks onto planets, stars, white dwarfs, and neutron stars via a boundary layer, a region of intense shear where gas transitions from a near-Keplerian speed to that of the surface. These regions are not susceptible to the common magnetorotational and Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities, and instead global modes generated by supersonic shear instabilities are a leading candidate to govern transport in these regions. This work investigates the dynamics of these systems under a range of thermodynamic conditions, surveying both disk sound speeds and cooling rates. Very fast and very slow cooling have little effect on wave dynamics: In the fast-cooling limit, waves propagate in an effectively isothermal manner, and in the slow-cooling limit, wave propagation is effectively adiabatic. However, when the cooling timescale is comparable to the wave period, wave damping becomes extreme. In cases with intermediate cooling rates, mass and angular momentum transport can be suppressed by orders of magnitude compared to isothermal and uncooled cases. Cooling in accretion disks leads to a preference for wavenumbers near and below the Mach number of the disk; the corresponding lower frequencies can (in nonisothermal systems) couple to gravity modes within the star, potentially driving low-frequency variability such as dwarf nova and quasi-periodic oscillations in accreting systems.

<div> GRB 200613A, Fermi satellite, Bayesian block method, Band+blackbody model, neutrino annihilation process
总结:<br /><br />本文报告了对Fermi卫星探测到的GRB 200613A的光学观测和多波段分析。通过贝叶斯分块方法进行了及时光谱分析，确定了统计上最佳的时间区间。根据贝叶斯信息准则，数据通常支持Band+黑体(BB)模型。我们推测主要的Band成分来自Blandford–Znajek机制，而额外的BB成分来自中微子湮灭过程。根据我们的模型与数据的比较，BB成分对于低自旋、高吸积速率的黑洞中央引擎是显著的。余辉光曲线表现出典型的幂律衰减，并且其行为可以通过抛射物和恒定星际介质的碰撞来解释。模型拟合得到如下参数：XXX。此外，我们使用公共Python包Prospector对宿主星系进行了光谱能量分布建模。结果表明，宿主星系是一颗大质量星系（），具有适度的星形成率（yr−1）。这种星形成率与从观测光谱中推导的∼34.2M⊙ yr−1的 [O ii]发射线的星形成率一致。 <div>
We present our optical observations and multiwavelength analysis of the GRB 200613A detected by the Fermi satellite. Time-resolved spectral analysis of the prompt gamma-ray emission was conducted utilizing the Bayesian block method to determine statistically optimal time bins. Based on the Bayesian Information Criterion, the data generally favor the Band+blackbody (BB) model. We speculate that the main Band component comes from the Blandford–Znajek mechanism, while the additional BB component comes from the neutrino annihilation process. The BB component becomes significant for a low-spin, high-accretion-rate black hole central engine, as evidenced by our model comparison with the data. The afterglow light curve exhibits typical power-law decay, and its behavior can be explained by the collision between the ejecta and the constant interstellar medium. Model fitting yields the following parameters: erg, , , cm−3, degree, and . In addition, we employed the public Python package Prospector to perform a spectral energy distribution modeling of the host galaxy. The results suggest that the host galaxy is a massive galaxy ( ) with a moderate star formation rate ( yr−1). This SFR is consistent with the SFR of ∼34.2M⊙ yr−1 derived from the [O ii] emission line in the observed spectrum.

<div> LAEs, low dust attenuation, ODIN, Lyα equivalent widths, [O ii] and [O iii] emitters<br />
<br />总结:<br />Lyman-alpha-emitting galaxies (LAEs)是年轻、低质量、星形成的星系，其低尘埃衰减使得它们的Lyα发射在观测中发光明亮。ODIN项目利用定制窄带滤光片在不同宇宙历史时期发现了大量LAE候选星系。研究引入了一种新的双宽带连续光谱估计技术，提高了Lyα当量宽度的估计精度。通过该方法，在扩展的COSMOS区域发现了大约6032、5691和4066个z=2.4、3.1和4.5的LAE候选星系。在LAE样本中，[O ii]发射星系的污染很小，但类似绿豌豆星系的[O iii]发射星系在红移4.5样本中很重要。研究还引入了一种识别[O ii]和[O iii]发射星系的创新方法，使得它们能够作为不同类别的对象进行研究。对每个星系样本进行了放大的堆叠光谱能量分布的中位数分析，展现了选择方法的整体成功。同时，计算了LAE样本的Lyα当量宽度，发现当量宽度分布最适合以w0 = 53 ± 1, 65 ± 1 和 59 ± 1 Å的指数函数拟合。 <div>
Lyman-alpha-emitting galaxies (LAEs) are typically young, low-mass, star-forming galaxies with little extinction from interstellar dust. Their low dust attenuation allows their Lyα emission to shine brightly in spectroscopic and photometric observations, providing an observational window into the high-redshift Universe. Narrowband surveys reveal large, uniform samples of LAEs at specific redshifts that probe large-scale structure and the temporal evolution of galaxy properties. The One-hundred-deg2 DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) utilizes three custom-made narrowband filters on the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) to discover LAEs at three equally spaced periods in cosmological history. In this paper, we introduce the hybrid-weighted double-broadband continuum estimation technique, which yields improved estimation of Lyα equivalent widths. Using this method, we discover 6032, 5691, and 4066 LAE candidates at z = 2.4, 3.1, and 4.5 in the extended COSMOS field (∼9 deg2). We find that [O ii] emitters are a minimal contaminant in our LAE samples, but that interloping Green Pea–like [O iii] emitters are important for our redshift 4.5 sample. We introduce an innovative method for identifying [O ii] and [O iii] emitters via a combination of narrowband excess and galaxy colors, enabling their study as separate classes of objects. We present scaled median stacked spectral energy distributions for each galaxy sample, revealing the overall success of our selection methods. We also calculate rest-frame Lyα equivalent widths for our LAE samples and find that the EW distributions are best fit by exponential functions with scale lengths of w0 = 53 ± 1, 65 ± 1, and 59 ± 1 Å, respectively.

Joint observations in electromagnetic and gravitational waves shed light on the physics of objects and surrounding environments with extreme gravity that are otherwise unreachable via siloed observations in each messenger. However, such detections remain challenging due to the rapid and faint nature of counterparts. Protocols for discovery and inference still rely on human experts manually inspecting survey alert streams and intuiting optimal usage of limited follow-up resources. Strategizing an optimal follow-up program requires adaptive sequential decision-making given evolving light curve data that (i) maximizes a global objective despite incomplete information and (ii) is robust to stochasticity introduced by detectors/observing conditions. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches allow agents to implicitly learn the physics or detector dynamics and the behavior policy that maximizes a designated objective through experience. To demonstrate the utility of such an approach for the kilonova follow-up problem, we train a toy RL agent with the goal of maximizing follow-up photometry for the true kilonova among several contaminant transient light curves. In a simulated environment where the agent learns online, it achieves 3× higher accuracy compared to a random strategy. However, it is surpassed by human agents by up to a factor of 2. This is likely because our hypothesis function (Q that is linear in state-action features) is an insufficient representation of the optimal behavior policy. More complex agents could perform at par or surpass human experts. Agents like these could pave the way for machine-directed software infrastructure to efficiently respond to next generation detectors, for conducting science inference and optimally planning expensive follow-up observations, scalably and with demonstrable performance guarantees.

Solar filaments can undergo eruptions that result in the formation of coronal mass ejections, which can significantly impact planetary space environments. Observations of eruptions involving polar crown filaments, situated in the polar regions of the Sun, are limited. In this study, we report a polar crown filament eruption (SOL2023-06-12), characterized by fast downflows below the filament. The downflows appear instantly after the onset of the filament eruption and persist for approximately 2 hr, exhibiting plane-of-sky velocities ranging between 92 and 144 km s−1. They originate from the leading edge of the filament, and no clear acceleration is observed. Intriguingly, these downflows appear at two distinct sites, symmetrically positioned at the opposite ends of the conjugate flare ribbons. Based on the observations, we propose that the filament might be supported by a magnetic flux rope (MFR), and these downflows possibly occur along the legs of the MFR. The downflows likely result from continuous reconnections between the MFR and the overlying magnetic field structures and could either be reconnection outflows or redirected filament materials. We also observed horizontal drifting of the locations of downflows, which might correspond to the MFR’s footpoint drifting. This type of downflow can potentially be utilized to track the footpoints of MFRs during eruptions.

这篇文章总结了对20 pc范围内棕矮星质量分布的研究成果。棕矮星的质量与其可观测参数（光度、光谱类型或颜色）之间缺乏相关性，因此棕矮星质量函数的测量必须通过代理测量和理论模型来获得。研究利用各种质量函数形式、出生率函数、低质量截断和理论进化模型，建立了有效温度分布的预测形式，并找到了与观测到的有效温度分布最匹配的质量函数。最终得出了一个简单的幂律形式的质量函数，并确定了恒星形成的低质量截断。研究还发现出生率对温度分布的影响较小，但不同的出生率倾向于较小的幂指数值。研究中的代码可公开获取。此外，研究还通过模拟老年（8-10亿年）棕矮星的分布，提出了亚矮温度间隙的宽度和位置的发现。
<br />总结: 棕矮星质量分布的研究揭示了质量函数形式和恒星形成的低质量截断，同时强调出生率对温度分布的影响。研究中开发的代码可用于模拟棕矮星的分布，并通过模拟老年棕矮星的分布，得出了亚矮温度间隙的宽度和位置的发现。 <div>
After decades of brown dwarf discovery and follow-up, we can now infer the functional form of the mass distribution within 20 pc, which serves as a constraint on star formation theory at the lowest masses. Unlike objects on the main sequence that have a clear luminosity-to-mass correlation, brown dwarfs lack a correlation between an observable parameter (luminosity, spectral type, or color) and mass. A measurement of the brown dwarf mass function must therefore be procured through proxy measurements and theoretical models. We utilize various assumed forms of the mass function, together with a variety of birthrate functions, low-mass cutoffs, and theoretical evolutionary models, to build predicted forms of the effective temperature distribution. We then determine the best fit of the observed effective temperature distribution to these predictions, which in turn reveals the most likely mass function. We find that a simple power law ( ) with α ≈ 0.5 is optimal. Additionally, we conclude that the low-mass cutoff for star formation is ≲0.005 M⊙. We corroborate the findings of Burgasser, which state that the birthrate has a far lesser impact than the mass function on the form of the temperature distribution, but we note that our alternate birthrates tend to favor slightly smaller values of α than the constant birthrate. Our code for simulating these distributions is publicly available. As another use case for this code, we present findings on the width and location of the subdwarf temperature gap by simulating distributions of very old (8–10 Gyr) brown dwarfs.

GS3 Hunter是一个基于深度学习的新方法，用于在星动力学数据中搜索亚结构和星流。该方法在FIRE宇宙模拟和Gaia和GALAH数据集的子集上进行了验证，并成功识别出相应的结果。此外，还应用于LAMOST数据集的K型巨星子集，识别出了已知的结构以及一些新的亚结构。GS3 Hunter有望成为一个有用的工具，帮助推进我们对银河系和局部星系团内外晕的理解，以及银河系周围的组装和潮汐剥离历史。<br /><br /> <div>
We present a novel, deep-learning-based method—dubbed Galactic-Seismology Substructures and Streams Hunter, or GS3 Hunter for short—to search for substructures and streams in stellar kinematics data. GS3 Hunter relies on a combined application of Siamese neural networks to transform the phase space information and the K-means algorithm for the clustering. As a validation test, we apply GS3 Hunter to a subset of the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) cosmological simulations. The stellar streams and substructures thus identified are in good agreement with corresponding results reported earlier by the FIRE team. In the same vein, we apply our method to a subset of local halo stars from the Gaia Early Data Release 3 and GALAH DR3 data sets and recover several previously known dynamical groups, such as Thamnos 1+2, the hot thick disk, ED-1, L-RL3, Helmi 1+2, Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, Sequoia, Virgo Radial Merger, Cronus, and Nereus. Finally, we apply our method without fine-tuning to a subset of K giant stars located in the inner halo region, obtained from the LAMOST Data Release 5 data set. We recover three previously known structures (Sagittarius, Hercules-Aquila Cloud, and the Virgo Overdensity), but we also discover a number of new substructures. We anticipate that GS3 Hunter will become a useful tool for the community dedicated to the search for stellar streams and structures in the Milky Way (MW) and the Local Group, thus helping advance our understanding of the stellar inner and outer halos and the assembly and tidal stripping history in and around the MW.

<div> IBEX, ENA, SW-LISM interaction, Voyager 1, Voyager 2
总结:
Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX)观测了来自太阳圈层的能量中性原子（ENA）通量，丰富了我们对太阳风与局部星际介质（LISM）相互作用的理解。研究人员提出了一个新模型，利用磁流体动力学模拟太阳风-LISM相互作用，并在通过太阳圈后传播捡起离子后分析了来自Voyager 2方向的IBEX观测。这项研究扩展了模型，包括了来自Voyager 1方向以及带状的低纬度部分。研究结果显示，Voyager 1方向的模型与Voyager 2方向的结果一致，并且中间带状部分的结果也能复现实际观测。最后，研究人员通过模拟展示了三个大压力波很可能在VLISM中合并，并被Voyager 1观测到为“pf2”，而至少其中一个波的效应在太阳圈层中被IBEX观测到，表现为2016年初ENA通量的短暂增强。 <div>
Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) observations of energetic neutral atom (ENA) fluxes from the heliosphere have greatly enriched our understanding of the interaction of the solar wind (SW) with the local interstellar medium (LISM). However, there has been recent controversy surrounding the inability of most ENA models to produce as high an intensity of ∼0.5–6 keV ENAs as IBEX observes at 1 au, especially as a function of time. In our previous study (E. J. Zirnstein et al.), we introduced a new model that utilizes a data-driven magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the SW–LISM interaction to propagate pickup ions through the heliosheath (HS) after they are nonadiabatically heated at the heliospheric termination shock. E. J. Zirnstein et al. only simulated and analyzed IBEX observations from the direction of Voyager 2. In this study, we expand our model to include fluxes from the direction of Voyager 1, as well as in the low-latitude part (middle) of the ribbon (10° below the ecliptic plane). We show that the model results at Voyager 1 are consistent with E. J. Zirnstein et al.’s results at Voyager 2 in terms of a secondary ENA source contribution of ≲20% from both directions. Our results in the middle of the ribbon also reproduce the data, when including a time-dependent secondary ENA source. Finally, we demonstrate with our simulation that three large pressure waves likely merged in the VLISM and were observed by Voyager 1 as “pf2,” while at least one of the wave’s effects in the HS was observed by IBEX as a brief enhancement in ENA flux in early 2016.

<br />
这篇论文使用Keck/LRIS和Keck/MOSFIRE光谱观测数据，研究了z ∼ 3星系的Lyα剖面形状与电离辐射逸出的关联。他们发现低速度分离vLyα,red的KLCS物体的电离辐射逸出比例显著更高。他们还发现Lyα剖面形状与fesc之间没有明显趋势。与文献中z ∼ 0.3的“Green Peas”星系的测量结果相比，KLCS对象在相同vLyα,red情况下具有更大的vsep和更高的fesc。作者得出结论，高红移源的Lyα剖面形状根本不同，vLyα,red等参数与fesc之间的关系也不同，并警告不要仅基于低红移矮星系的Lyα剖面构建重离子化时期的fesc诊断。
<br /><br />总结: 高红移星系的Lyα剖面形状与电离辐射逸出相关，低速度分离的KLCS物体具有更高的电离辐射逸出比例。Lyα剖面形状与fesc之间没有明显趋势。与z ∼ 0.3的“Green Peas”星系相比，KLCS对象具有不同的Lyα剖面形状和逸出比例。作者警告不要仅基于低红移矮星系的Lyα剖面构建重离子化时期的fesc诊断。 <div>
While the shape of the Lyα profile is viewed as one of the best tracers of ionizing-photon escape fraction (fesc) within low-redshift (z ∼ 0.3) surveys of the Lyman continuum, this connection remains untested at high redshift. Here, we combine deep, rest-UV Keck/LRIS spectra of 80 objects from the Keck Lyman Continuum Spectroscopic Survey with rest-optical Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy in order to examine potential correlations between Lyα profile shape and the escape of ionizing radiation within z ∼ 3 star-forming galaxies. We measure the velocity separation between double-peaked Lyα emission structure (vsep), between red-side Lyα emission peaks and systemic (vLyα,red), and between red-side emission peaks and low-ionization interstellar absorption lines (vLyα−LIS). We find that the IGM-corrected ratio of ionizing to nonionizing flux density is significantly higher in KLCS objects with lower vLyα,red. We find no significant trend between measures of ionizing-photon escape and vLyα−LIS. We compare our results to measurements of z ∼ 0.3 “Green Peas” from the literature and find that KLCS objects have larger vsep at fixed vLyα,red, larger fesc at fixed vLyα,red, and higher vLyα,red overall than z ∼ 0.3 analogs. We conclude that the Lyα profile shapes of our high-redshift sources are fundamentally different, and that measurements of profile shape such as vLyα,red map on to fesc in different ways. We caution against building reionization-era fesc diagnostics based purely on Lyα profiles of low-redshift dwarf galaxies. Tracing vsep, vLyα,red, and fesc in a larger sample of z ∼ 3 galaxies will reveal how these variables may be connected for galaxies at the epoch of reionization.

<div> 关键词: 质量间隙黑洞-中子星并合, 引力波, 恒星演化, 天体物理, 脉冲星

总结:
质量间隙黑洞-中子星（mgBHNS）并合是引力波事件中GW230529的一个重要组成部分，由孤立双星演化渠道形成。研究使用“延迟”超新星模型和合理的模型实现来模拟人口综合，结果表明我们的模拟可以同时匹配从人口分析推断出的mgBHNS和总BHNS并合的速率密度，以及LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration报道的BH质量在BHNS并合中的分布。GW230529对推断的mgBHNS速率密度贡献显著，因此我们建议GW230529可以通过孤立双星演化渠道解释。考虑AP4（DD2）态方程，GW230529发生撕裂的概率分别为12.8％（63.2％）。如果GW230529是一个撕裂事件，其金新星峰值视星等预测约为23-24等，并且可以被当前的观测项目和大型巡天望远镜发现。由于GW230529可能是GW观测推断出的非轴向事件，其相关的伽玛射线暴（GRB）可能太暗而无法被γ射线探测器观测到，解释了缺乏GRB观测。我们的研究表明由于GW230529的发现，通过孤立双星演化渠道形成mgBHNS并合的存在，表明BHNS并合仍有可能是发射引力波、伽玛射线暴和金新星的多信使源。虽然mgBHNS并合占据了宇宙学BHNS人口的约50％，但我们发现≳90％的被撕裂的BHNS并合预计来自mgBHNS并合的形成。 <div>
In this paper, we explore the formation of the mass-gap black hole-neutron star (mgBHNS) merger detected in gravitational wave (GW) event, i.e., GW230529, from the isolated binary evolution channel, and study potential signatures of its electromagnetic counterparts. By adopting the “delayed” supernova prescription and reasonable model realizations, our population synthesis simulation results can simultaneously match the rate densities of mgBHNS and total BHNS mergers inferred from the population analyses, along with the population distribution of the BH mass in BHNS mergers reported by the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA Collaboration. Because GW230529 contributes significantly to the inferred mgBHNS rate densities, we suggest that GW230529 can be explained through the isolated binary evolution channel. Considering the AP4 (DD2) equation of state, the probability that GW230529 can make tidal disruption is 12.8% (63.2%). If GW230529 is a disrupted event, its kilonova peak apparent magnitude is predicted ∼23–24 mag, and hence, can be detected by the present survey projects and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. Since GW230529 could be an off-axis event inferred from the GW observation, its associated gamma-ray burst (GRB) might be too dim to be observed by γ-ray detectors, interpreting the lack of GRB observations. Our study suggests the existence of mgBHNS mergers formed through the isolated binary evolution channel due to the discovery of GW230529, indicating that BHNS mergers are still likely to be multimessenger sources that emit GWs, GRBs, and kilonovae. Although mgBHNS mergers account for ∼50% of the cosmological BHNS population, we find that ≳90% of disrupted BHNS mergers are expected to originate from mgBHNS mergers.

总结:
在太阳系的边界区域，也就是太阳风终止震波和日球层之间的赫尔尼辣甚重要。本文使用自洽的混合动力学模拟研究了湍流对赫尔尼辣中离子分布的影响，并与旅行者号观测进行了比较，限定了湍流的振幅和可压缩性范围。结果表明，湍流耗散导致太阳风热离子的温度显著增加，从而增加了低能量处（约100电子伏）的ENAs的电荷交换源。然而，湍流的影响可能不足以完全解释这些不一致。<br /><br /> <div>
The distribution of ions in the heliosheath—the region between the heliospheric termination shock and the heliopause—is important for understanding remote observations of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs). The ion distributions were estimated previously based on hybrid simulations of the heating and evolution of solar wind and interstellar pickup ions across the solar wind termination shock, but these estimates only provide the distributions near the shock. In this work, we use self-consistent hybrid kinetic simulations to investigate the effects of turbulence on ion distributions in the heliosheath. The simulations are compared against Voyager observations, constraining the feasible amplitude and compressibility of turbulence. We find that the heating due to turbulent dissipation can lead to a significant increase in the temperature of thermal solar wind ions. Both turbulent velocity fluctuations and the heating of solar wind ions increase the charge-exchange source for ENAs at low energies (around 100 eV), where current ENA models underpredict observations by more than an order of magnitude. However, the effects of turbulence are likely not strong enough to fully explain these discrepancies.

<div> LHS 3154 b, 质量, 恒星, 行星形成理论, 模拟

总结:
LHS 3154 b是一颗质量为13.2倍地球质量的行星，围绕质量为0.11太阳质量的恒星运转。这一发现挑战了传统的行星形成理论，认为质量较小的恒星周围不会形成质量如此巨大的行星。研究人员提出了“打破锁链”情景的模拟，表明类似LHS 3154 b这样质量巨大且距离恒星较近的行星在模拟系统中出现的概率约为1%。这一结果暗示这些行星不需要特别不寻常的形成条件，而是已有的理论可以解释。另外，模拟系统中还包含大约30天公转周期的小行星，这为该假设提供了可能的检验。 <div>
Conventional planet formation theories predict a paucity of massive planets around small stars, especially very low-mass (0.1−0.3 M⊙) mid-to-late M dwarfs. Such tiny stars are expected to form planets of terrestrial sizes but not much bigger. However, this expectation is challenged by the recent discovery of LHS 3154 b, a planet with period of 3.7 days and minimum mass of 13.2 M⊕ orbiting a 0.11 M⊙ star. Here, we propose that close-in Neptune-mass planets like LHS 3154 b formed through an anomalous series of mergers from a primordial compact system of super-Earths. We perform simulations within the context of the “breaking the chains” scenario, in which super-Earths initially form in tightly spaced chains of mean-motion resonances before experiencing dynamical instabilities and collisions. Planets as massive and close-in as LHS 3154 b (Mp ∼ 12−20 M⊕, P < 7 days) are produced in ∼1% of simulated systems, in broad agreement with their low observed occurrence. These results suggest that such planets do not require particularly unusual formation conditions but rather are an occasional by-product of a process that is already theorized to explain compact multiplanet systems. Interestingly, our simulated systems with LHS 3154 b-like planets also contain smaller planets at around ∼30 days, offering a possible test of this hypothesis.

总结:
NGC 3718是一种近邻特殊星系，其光学形态受多重潮汐臂、扭曲盘和显著的弯曲尘埃巷的影响，但在近红外波段下，它看起来是一个以球状组分为主的星系。研究发现，这种扰动的形态使其成为研究潮汐扰动星系中恒星形成的理想案例。通过对星系进行分区，研究了恒星形成团的分布和特性。研究结果表明，次级并合事件可以触发星系盘的内部－外部生长，年轻的恒星形成团位于外潮汐臂而非内盘中。在中心盘区，恒星形成密度较大，恒星形成团的年龄也较大。 <br /><br /> <div>
We present a UV, optical, and near-IR study of the star-forming complexes in the nearby peculiar galaxy NGC 3718, using Ultraviolet Imaging telescope, Galaxy Evolution Explorer, Spitzer, and DECam Legacy Survey imaging data. The galaxy has a disturbed optical morphology owing to the multiple tidal arms, the warped disk, and the prominent curved dust lanes, but in the near-IR it appears to be a bulge-dominated galaxy. Its disturbed morphology makes it an excellent case to study star formation in a tidally disturbed galaxy that may have undergone a recent minor merger. To study the distribution and properties of the star-forming clumps (SFCs), we divided the galaxy within the R25 (B band) radius into three parts—the upper, central, and lower regions. Using the UV band images, we investigated the warped star-forming disk, the extended tidal arms, and the distribution and sizes of the 182 SFCs. Their distribution is 49, 60, and 73 in the galaxy’s upper, central, and lower regions, respectively. We determined the UV color, star formation rates (SFRs), star formation density (ΣSFR), and ages of the SFCs. The central disk of the galaxy has a larger mean ΣSFR that is ∼3.3 and ∼1.6 times higher than the upper and lower regions, respectively. We also find that the SFCs in the central disk are older than those in the tidal arms. Our study thus shows that minor mergers can trigger the inside-out growth of galaxy disks, where the younger SFCs are in outer tidal arms and not in the inner disk.

总结:
核心形成的主要机制是超大质量黑洞双星的清除作用和来自引力波反冲的加热作用。研究使用N体模拟模拟了四个具有超过0.5千秒差距的大质量椭圆星系的形成过程。结果表明，NGC 1600和A2147-BCG的核心尺寸小于1.3千秒差距，可以通过双星清除机制形成，而NGC 6166和A2261-BCG的大于2千秒差距的核心则需要引力波引起的加热作用。引力波加热作用会导致表面亮度变平，对应着真正的三维空间密度的平坦核心，并且会优先移除轨道角动量低的恒星离星系核心。 <br /><br /> <div>
Scouring by supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries is the most accepted mechanism for the formation of the cores seen in giant elliptical galaxies. However, an additional mechanism is required to explain the largest observed cores. Gravitational-wave (GW) recoil is expected to trigger further growth of the core, as subsequent heating from dynamical friction of the merged SMBH removes stars from the central regions. We model core formation in massive elliptical galaxies from both binary scouring and heating by GW recoil and examine their unique signatures. We aim to determine whether the nature of cores in 3D space density can be attributed uniquely to either process and whether the magnitude of the kick can be inferred. We perform N-body simulations of galactic mergers of multicomponent galaxies, based on the observed parameters of four massive elliptical galaxies with cores >0.5 kpc. After binary scouring and hardening, the merged SMBH remnant is given a range of GW recoil kicks with 0.5–0.9 of the escape speed of the galaxy. We find that binary scouring alone can form the cores of NGC 1600 and A2147-BCG, which are <1.3 kpc in size. However, the >2 kpc cores in NGC 6166 and A2261-BCG require heating from GW recoil kicks of <0.5 of the galaxy escape speed. A unique feature of GW recoil heating is flatter cores in surface brightness, corresponding to truly flat cores in 3D space density. It also preferentially removes stars on low angular momentum orbits from the galactic nucleus.

总结:
CME是一种复杂的磁化等离子体结构，其磁轴与黄道面角度不同，会受到不均匀和各向同性的星际磁场和太阳风的影响。研究使用EUHFORIA 3D模型进行模拟，关注CME倾斜度对其传播的影响。研究发现，CME的倾斜度会影响其保护层演变、磁流体动力学阻力和非径向流动。此外，研究还发现，随着距离太阳的增加，保护层持续时间会增加，而非径向流动在黄道面外更为显著。然而，在数值设定上无法解决阻力参数的倾斜度依赖性。 <div>
Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are complex magnetized plasma structures in which the magnetic field spirals around a central axis, forming what is known as a flux rope (FR). The central FR axis can be oriented at any angle with respect to the ecliptic. Throughout its journey, a CME will encounter interplanetary magnetic fields and solar winds that are neither homogeneous nor isotropic. Consequently, CMEs with different orientations will encounter different ambient medium conditions and, thus, the interaction of a CME with its surrounding environment will vary depending on the orientation of its FR axis, among other factors. This study aims to understand the effect of inclination on CME propagation. We performed simulations with the EUHFORIA 3D magnetohydrodynamic model. This study focuses on two CMEs modeled as spheromaks with nearly identical properties, differing only by their inclination. We show the effects of CME orientation on sheath evolution, MHD drag, and nonradial flows by analyzing the model data from a swarm of 81 virtual spacecraft scattered across the inner heliospheric. We have found that the sheath duration increases with radial distance from the Sun and that the rate of increase is greater on the flanks of the CME. Nonradial flows within the studied sheath region appear larger outside the ecliptic plane, indicating a “sliding” of the interplanetary magnetic field in the out-of-ecliptic plane. We found that the calculated drag parameter does not remain constant with radial distance and that the inclination dependence of the drag parameter cannot be resolved with our numerical setup.

<title>The Accelerating Decline of the Mass Transfer Rate in the Recurrent Nova T Pyxidis*</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The recurrent nova T Pyxidis (T Pyx) has erupted six times since 1890, with its last outburst in 2011, and the relatively short recurrence time between classical nova explosions indicates that T Pyx must have a massive white dwarf (WD) accreting at a high rate. It is believed that, since its outburst in 1890, the mass transfer rate in T Pyx was very large due to a feedback loop where the secondary is heated by the hot WD. The feedback loop has been slowly shutting off, reducing the mass transfer rate, and thereby explaining the magnitude decline of T Pyx from ∼13.8 (before 1890) to 15.7 just before the 2011 eruption. We present an analysis of the latest Hubble Space Telescope far-ultraviolet and optical spectra, obtained 12 yr after the 2011 outburst, showing that the mass transfer rate has been steadily declining and is now below its preoutburst level by about 40%: yr−1 for a WD mass of ∼1.0–1.4 M⊙, an inclination of 50°–60°, reddening of E(B − V) = 0.30 ± 0.05, and a Gaia Data Release 3 distance of pc. This steady decrease in the mass transfer rate in the ∼decade after the 2011 outburst is in sharp contrast with the more constant preoutburst ultraviolet continuum flux level from archival International Ultraviolet Explorer spectra. The flux (i.e., ) decline rate is 29 times faster now in the last ∼decade than observed since 1890 to ∼2010. The feedback loop shut off seems to be accelerating, at least in the decade following its 2011 outburst. In all eventualities, our analysis confirms that T Pyx is going through an unusually peculiar short-lived phase.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The end of supernova remnant (SNR) evolution is characterized by a so-called “radiative” stage, in which efficient cooling of the hot bubble inside the forward shock slows expansion, leading to eventual shock breakup. Understanding SNR evolution at this stage is vital for predicting feedback in galaxies, since SNRs are expected to deposit their energy and momentum into the interstellar medium at the ends of their lives. A key prediction of SNR evolutionary models is the formation at the onset of the radiative stage of a cold, dense shell behind the forward shock. However, searches for these shells via their neutral hydrogen emission have had limited success. We instead introduce an independent observational signal of shell formation arising from the interaction between nonthermal particles accelerated by the SNR forward shock (cosmic rays) and the dense shell. Using a semi-analytic model of particle acceleration based on state-of-the-art simulations coupled with a high-resolution hydrodynamic model of SNR evolution, we predict the nonthermal emission that arises from this interaction. We demonstrate that the onset of the radiative stage leads to nonthermal signatures from radio to gamma rays, including radio and gamma-ray brightening by nearly 2 orders of magnitude. Such a signature may be detectable with current instruments, and will be resolvable with the next generation of gamma-ray telescopes (namely, the Cherenkov Telescope Array).

A population of structures unique to the Galactic Center (GC), known as the nonthermal filaments (NTFs), has been studied for over 40 yr, but much remains unknown about them. In particular, there is no widely accepted and unified understanding for how the relativistic electrons illuminating these structures are generated. One possibility is that there are compact and extended sources of cosmic rays, which then diffuse along magnetic flux tubes leading to the illumination of the NTFs through synchrotron emission. In this work, we present and discuss the polarimetric distributions associated with a set of faint NTFs in the GC that have only been studied in total intensity previously. We compare the derived polarized intensity, rotation measure, and intrinsic magnetic field distributions for these structures with the results obtained for previously observed GC NTFs. The results are then used to enhance our understanding of the large-scale polarimetric properties of the GC. We then use the derived polarimetric distributions to constrain models for the mechanisms generating the relativistic electrons that illuminate these structures.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Meteorites and their components exhibit a diverse range of oxygen isotope compositions, and the isotopic exchange timescale between dust grains and ambient gas is a key parameter for understanding the spatiotemporal evolution of the solar nebula. As dust grains existed as macroscopic aggregates in the solar nebula, it is necessary to consider the isotopic exchange timescales for these aggregates. Here, we theoretically estimate the isotope exchange timescales between dust aggregates and ambient vapor. The isotope exchange process between aggregates and ambient vapor is divided into four processes: (i) supply of gas molecules to the aggregate surface, (ii) diffusion of molecules within the aggregate, (iii) isotope exchange on the surface of constituent particles, and (iv) isotope diffusion within the particles. We evaluate these timescales and assess which one becomes the rate-determining step. We reveal that the isotope exchange timescale is approximately the same as that of the constituent particles when the aggregate radius is smaller than the critical value, which is a few centimeters when considering the exchange reaction between amorphous forsterite aggregates and water vapor.

总结: Parker Solar Probe在靠近太阳的轨道上发现了大幅度的Alfvén波，在离散的磁场反转区域产生了磁场反转斑块。文章使用了Solar Orbiter的数据，发现这些斑块并没有区别于周围太阳风的离子和元素组成。同时，斑块和周围的太阳风都表现出快速和慢速风的特征，说明它们可能源自太阳日冕区域不同的磁场和热性质。研究还表明，可能是置换重连接和/或剪切驱动过程在斑块的形成中发挥了作用。<br /><br /> <div>
Since Parker Solar Probe’s (Parker’s) first perihelion pass at the Sun, large-amplitude Alfvén waves grouped in patches have been observed near the Sun throughout the mission. Several formation processes for these magnetic switchback patches have been suggested with no definitive consensus. To provide insight into their formation, we examine the heavy ion properties of several adjacent magnetic switchback patches around Parker’s 11th perihelion pass, capitalizing on a spacecraft lineup with Solar Orbiter where each samples the same solar wind streams over a large range of longitudes. Heavy ion properties (Fe/O, C6+/C5+, O7+/O6+) related to the wind’s coronal origin, measured with Solar Orbiter, can be linked to switchback patch structures identified near the Sun with Parker. We find that switchback patches do not contain distinctive ion and elemental compositional signatures different from the surrounding nonswitchback solar wind. Both the patches and ambient wind exhibit a range of fast and slow wind qualities, indicating coronal sources with open and closed field lines in close proximity. These observations and modeling indicate switchback patches form in coronal hole boundary wind and with a range of source region magnetic and thermal properties. Furthermore, the heavy ion signatures suggest interchange reconnection and/or shear-driven processes may play a role in their creation.

slick是一个软件包，用于通过计算物理特性和环境来计算模型云的CO、[C i]和[C ii]的亮度。通过将机器学习方法合并到这一过程中，我们还能够预测星系的线发射的宇宙演化特性，比如亮度函数。我们对100,000个气体粒子和2500个星系进行了测试，对所有谱线达到了约99.8%的平均准确度。最后，我们展示了在宇宙学水动力模拟中创建的首个模型光锥，其中包括从z = 0到z = 10的真实和机器学习预测的CO、[C i]和[C ii]的亮度。 
<br />总结: 该软件包通过despotic辐射传输代码计算模拟云和星系的真实CO、[C i]和[C ii]亮度，并且通过机器学习方法预测了线发射的演化特性。 <div>
We present slick (the Scalable Line Intensity Computation Kit), a software package that calculates realistic CO, [C i], and [C ii] luminosities for clouds and galaxies formed in hydrodynamic simulations. Built on the radiative transfer code despotic, slick computes the thermal, radiative, and statistical equilibrium in concentric zones of model clouds, based on their physical properties and individual environments. We validate our results by applying slick to the high-resolution run of the Simba simulations, testing the derived luminosities against empirical and theoretical/analytic relations. To simulate the line emission from a universe of emitting clouds, we have incorporated random forest machine learning (ML) methods into our approach, allowing us to predict cosmologically evolving properties of CO, [C i], and [C ii] emission from galaxies such as luminosity functions. We tested this model in 100,000 gas particles, and 2500 galaxies, reaching an average accuracy of ∼99.8% for all lines. Finally, we present the first model light cones created with realistic and ML-predicted CO, [C i], and [C ii] luminosities in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, from z = 0 to z = 10.

利用JWST MIRI/Medium Resolution Spectrograph积分场观测，展示了GATOS调查中包括的六个邻近Seyfert星系的千秒巴尔中心区域的电离气体分布和动力学的多样性。具体来说，我们呈现了六条电离发射线的空间分辨率的流量分布和速度场图，涵盖了很大范围的电离电位（15.8-97.1 eV）。根据这些地图，我们展示了六个目标的电离气体流出的证据，发现NGC 5728、NGC 5506和ESO137-G034存在一些高度扰动的区域。我们提出，AGN驱动的无线电喷流可能在触发这些高度扰动的区域中发挥着重要作用。基于[Ne V]发射估算的流出速率，我们发现这六个目标的电离流出速率趋于收敛到比以前更窄的范围。这些结果对于具有可比辐射度的AGN的流出性质具有重要意义。<br /><br />总结: 利用JWST MIRI的积分场观测，展示了六个邻近Seyfert星系的电离气体分布和动力学的多样性，发现了电离气体流出的证据，推测AGN驱动的无线电喷流可能在触发高度扰动的区域中发挥着重要作用，对AGN的流出性质具有重要意义。 <div>
Utilizing JWST MIRI/Medium Resolution Spectrograph integral field unit observations of the kiloparsec-scale central regions, we showcase the diversity of ionized gas distributions and kinematics in six nearby Seyfert galaxies included in the GATOS survey. Specifically, we present spatially resolved flux distribution and velocity field maps of six ionized emission lines covering a large range of ionization potentials (15.8–97.1 eV). Based on these maps, we showcase the evidence of ionized gas outflows in the six targets, and find some highly disturbed regions in NGC 5728, NGC 5506, and ESO137-G034. We propose active galactic nucleus (AGN)-driven radio jets plausibly play an important role in triggering these highly disturbed regions. With the outflow rates estimated based on [Ne V] emission, we find the six targets tend to have ionized outflow rates converged to a narrower range than the previous finding. These results have an important implication for the outflow properties in AGN of comparable luminosity.

The ϵ Lupi A (HD 136504) system stands out among magnetic massive binaries as the only short-period binary system in which both components have detectable magnetic fields. The proximity of the magnetospheres of the components leads to magnetospheric interactions, which are revealed as periodic pulses in the radio light curve of this system. In this work, we aim to investigate the magnetospheric interaction phenomenon in the X-ray domain. We observed this system with the XMM-Newton telescope, covering its orbital period. We observe variable X-ray emission with maximum flux near periastron, showing similarity with radio observations. The X-ray spectra show significantly elevated hard X-ray flux during periastron. We attribute the soft X-ray emission to individual magnetospheres, while the hard X-ray emission is explained by magnetospheric interaction, particularly due to magnetic reconnection. However, unlike in the radio, we do not find any significant short-term X-ray bursts. This exotic system may be an ideal target to study magnetospheric interactions in close binaries with organized magnetospheres.

<br />
通过采用k-ω模型，模拟了不同金属丰度和初始质量的氮序列Wolf-Rayet（WNL）星的演化，包括旋转和非旋转模型，并与经典的过冷模型进行了比较。结果表明，在相同的初始条件下，k−ω模型通常会产生更大的对流核心和更宽的过冷区，从而增加了WNL星的质量范围和寿命，并增加形成WNL星的可能性。WNL星的质量和寿命都随着金属丰度和初始质量的增加而增加。在高金属丰度条件下，两种过冷方案在WNL星的寿命上存在明显差异，但在WNL星的质量范围上差异不大。旋转可能会在低质量、金属贫穷对应体中促使WNL星的形成，这种效应在过冷模型中更为显著。在主序星相形成的富金属WNL星的表面氮可能主要来自CN循环，而在相对金属贫穷的对应体中可能来自CN和NO循环。我们的模型可以有效解释银河系中WNL星的分布，但似乎在解释大麦哲伦星云中的WNL星方面存在不足。 <br /><br />总结: 演化模拟表明，k-ω模型产生较大的对流核心和更宽的超越区域，增加了WNL星的寿命和形成可能性。WNL星的质量和寿命随金属丰度和初始质量增加而增加，而旋转有助于在低质量、金属贫穷对应体中形成WNL星。表面氮的来源在不同金属丰度条件下存在差异。这一模型解释了银河系中WNL星的分布，但解释大麦哲伦星云中的WNL星还存在不足。 <div>
We adopt a set of second-order differential equations (k − ω model) to handle core convective overshooting in massive stars, simulate the evolution of nitrogen sequence Wolf–Rayet (WNL) stars with different metallicities and initial masses, both rotating and nonrotating models, and compare the results with the classical overshooting model. The results indicate that, under the same initial conditions, the k − ω model generally produces larger convective cores and wider overshooting regions, thereby increasing the mass ranges and extending the lifetimes of WNL stars, as well as the likelihood of forming WNL stars. The masses and lifetimes of WNL stars both increase with higher metallicities and initial masses. Under higher-metallicity conditions, the two overshooting schemes significantly differ in their impacts on the lifetimes of WNL stars, but are insignificant in the mass ranges of the WNL stars. Rotation may drive the formation of WNL stars in low-mass, metal-poor counterparts, with this effect being more pronounced in the overshooting model. The surface nitrogen of metal-rich WNL stars formed during the main-sequence phase is likely primarily from the CN cycle, while it may come from both the CN and NO cycles for relatively metal-poor counterparts. Our model can effectively explain the distribution of WNL stars in the Milky Way, but appears to have inadequacies in explaining the WNL stars in the LMC.

We present a catalog of stellar parameters (effective temperature Teff, surface gravity , age, and metallicity [Fe/H]) and elemental-abundance ratios ([C/Fe], [Mg/Fe], and [α/Fe]) for some five million stars (4.5 million dwarfs and 0.5 million giant stars) in the Milky Way, based on stellar colors from the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) DR3 and Gaia EDR3. These estimates are obtained through the construction of a large spectroscopic training set with parameters and abundances adjusted to uniform scales, and trained with a kernel principal component analysis. Owing to the seven narrow/medium-band filters employed by J-PLUS, we obtain precisions in the abundance estimates that are as good as or better than those derived from medium-resolution spectroscopy for stars covering a wide range of the parameter space: 0.10–0.20 dex for [Fe/H] and [C/Fe], and 0.05 dex for [Mg/Fe] and [α/Fe]. Moreover, systematic errors due to the influence of molecular carbon bands on previous photometric-metallicity estimates (which only included two narrow/medium-band blue filters) have now been removed, resulting in photometric-metallicity estimates down to [Fe/H] ∼ −4.0, with typical uncertainties of 0.40 dex and 0.25 dex for dwarfs and giants, respectively. This large photometric sample should prove useful for the exploration of the assembly and chemical-evolution history of our Galaxy.

We explore the influence of radio-mode feedback on the properties of the cool circumgalactic medium (CGM). To this end, we assemble a statistical sample of approximately 30,000 radio galaxies with background quasars by combining optical spectroscopic measurements of luminous red galaxies and quasars from the year 1 data set of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and radio sources from the LOw-Frequency ARray Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) DR2 catalog and the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) quick-look catalog. Galaxies with similar optical properties but with no radio counterparts in LoTSS and VLASS are selected as the control group. We measure the cool CGM properties of radio galaxies and their control samples traced by Mg ii absorption lines, including covering fraction, rest equivalent width, and gas kinematics. Our results show no significant difference in the properties of gas around radio galaxies and their control sample, indicating that the operating radio-mode feedback of massive galaxies does not produce detectable effects on the properties of the cool CGM. Finally, we show that the CGM of radio galaxies contains a nonnegligible amount of cool gas with approximately 1010M⊙. This abundance can place a stringent constraint on the radio-mode feedback models.

Solar energetic particle (SEP) events are one of the most crucial aspects of space weather that require continuous monitoring and forecasting using robust methods. We demonstrate a proof of concept of using a data-driven supervised classification framework on a multivariate time-series data set covering solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. We implement ensemble modeling that merges the results from three proton channels (E ≥ 10 MeV, 50 MeV, and 100 MeV) and the long-band X-ray flux (1–8 Å) channel from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite missions. Our task is binary classification, such that the aim of the model is to distinguish strong SEP events from nonevents. Here, strong SEP events are those crossing the Space Weather Prediction Center’s “S1” threshold of solar radiation storm and proton fluxes below that threshold are weak SEP events. In addition, we consider periods of nonoccurrence of SEPs following a flare with magnitudes ≥C6.0 to maintain a natural imbalance of sample distribution. In our data set, there are 244 strong SEP events comprising the positive class. There are 189 weak events and 2460 “SEP-quiet” periods for the negative class. We experiment with summary statistic, one-nearest neighbor, and supervised time-series forest (STSF) classifiers and compare their performance to validate our methods for prediction windows from 5 minutes up to 60 minutes. We find the STSF model to perform better under all circumstances. For an optimal classification threshold of ≈0.3 and a 60 minutes prediction window, we obtain a true skill statistic TSS = 0.850, Heidke skill score HSS = 0.878, and Gilbert skill score GSS = 0.783.

Potential field source surface (PFSS) models are widely used to simulate coronal magnetic fields. PFSS models use the observed photospheric magnetic field as the inner boundary condition and assume a perfectly radial field beyond a “source surface” (Rss). At present, total solar eclipse (TSE) white-light images are the only data that delineate the coronal magnetic field from the photosphere out to several solar radii (R⊙). We utilize a complete solar cycle span of these images between 2008 and 2020 as a benchmark to assess the reliability of PFSS models. For a quantitative assessment, we apply the Rolling Hough Transform to the eclipse data and corresponding PFFS models to measure the difference, Δθ, between the data and model magnetic field lines throughout the corona. We find that the average Δθ, 〈Δθ〉, can be minimized for a given choice of Rss depending on the phase within a solar cycle. In particular, Rss ≈ 1.3 R⊙ is found to be optimal for solar maximum, while Rss ≈ 3 R⊙ yields a better match at solar minimum. Regardless, large (〈Δθ〉 > 10°) discrepancies between TSE data and PFSS-generated coronal field lines remain regardless of the choice of source surface. However, implementation of solar-cycle-dependent Rss optimal values does yield more reliable PFSS-generated coronal field lines for use in models and for tracing in situ measurements back to their sources at the Sun.

We present Lightcurve Anomaly Identification and Similarity Search (LAISS), an automated pipeline to detect anomalous astrophysical transients in real-time data streams. We deploy our anomaly detection model on the nightly Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Alert Stream via the ANTARES broker, identifying a manageable ∼1–5 candidates per night for expert vetting and coordinating follow-up observations. Our method leverages statistical light-curve and contextual host galaxy features within a random forest classifier, tagging transients of rare classes (spectroscopic anomalies), of uncommon host galaxy environments (contextual anomalies), and of peculiar or interaction-powered phenomena (behavioral anomalies). Moreover, we demonstrate the power of a low-latency (∼ms) approximate similarity search method to find transient analogs with similar light-curve evolution and host galaxy environments. We use analogs for data-driven discovery, characterization, (re)classification, and imputation in retrospective and real-time searches. To date, we have identified ∼50 previously known and previously missed rare transients from real-time and retrospective searches, including but not limited to superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), tidal disruption events, SNe IIn, SNe IIb, SNe I-CSM, SNe Ia-91bg-like, SNe Ib, SNe Ic, SNe Ic-BL, and M31 novae. Lastly, we report the discovery of 325 total transients, all observed between 2018 and 2021 and absent from public catalogs (∼1% of all ZTF Astronomical Transient reports to the Transient Name Server through 2021). These methods enable a systematic approach to finding the “needle in the haystack” in large-volume data streams. Because of its integration with the ANTARES broker, LAISS is built to detect exciting transients in Rubin data.

总结: 
本文研究了伽马射线暴后的迟发射，即在观测到的100-1000秒后出现的X射线异常。研究估计了这些迟发射产生的中微子的检测可能性，并发现IceCube-Gen2通过堆积约1000-2000个事件有望实现中微子的检测。同时，文章还指出即使未检测到中微子，仍可以获得有意义的对迟发射特性的约束。文章的研究有望为未来的多信使观测提供重要的参考。<br /><br /> <div>
In gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), ∼100–1000 s after the prompt emission, afterglow observations have consistently shown X-ray excesses detected in the form of flares (in long GRBs) or extended emission (in short GRBs). These observations are interpreted as emissions from jets launched by late central engine activity. However, the characteristics of these late-time jets, particularly the dissipation radius (rdiss), Lorentz factor (Γ), and cosmic-ray loading factor (ξp), remain unknown despite their importance. Here, in order to understand the properties of the late-time jets with future multimessenger observations, we estimate the detectability of neutrinos associated with late-time emissions for a wide range of rdiss and Γ, assuming ξp = 10. We take into account external seed photons from the cocoon around the jets, which can enhance the neutrino production through photohadronic interaction in the jet dissipation region. Our results are still consistent with the upper limit obtained by IceCube. Our calculations indicate a promising prospect for neutrino detection with IceCube-Gen2 through the stacking of ∼1000–2000 events, for a wide range of rdiss and Γ. We found that setting an optimal energy threshold of 10 TeV can significantly reduce noise without negatively affecting neutrino detection. Furthermore, even in the case of nondetection, we show that meaningful constraints on the characteristics of the late-time jets can be obtained.

<div> 电子束分布、太阳耀斑、能量通量、返回电流、等离子体参数
<br /><br />总结: 
本文重点研究了高能电子束在传播过程中的能量通量减少以及返回电流对加速电子束所携带能量通量的影响。通过系统计算，得出了在不同的束流和等离子体参数下，返回电流损失对能量通量的重要性，并估计了能量通量损失的程度。此外，还分析了在注入通量较高时可能出现的两种情况：一是失控电子的显著影响，二是电流驱动不稳定性的显著影响。最后，还讨论了返回电流对电子束反射的重要性，指出许多太阳耀斑的解释需要重新审视以考虑返回电流的影响。 <div>
High-energy electrons carry much of a solar flare’s energy. Therefore, understanding changes in electron beam distributions during their propagation is crucial. A key focus of this paper is how the cospatial return current reduces the energy flux carried by these accelerated electrons. We systematically compute this reduction for various beam and plasma parameters relevant to solar flares. Our 1D model accounts for collisions between beam and plasma electrons, return-current electric-field deceleration, thermalization in a warm target approximation, and runaway electron contributions. The results focus on the classical (Spitzer) regime, offering a valuable benchmark for energy flux reduction and its extent. Return-current losses are only negligible for the lowest nonthermal fluxes. We calculate the conditions for return-current losses to become significant and estimate the extent of the modification to the beam’s energy flux density. We also calculate two additional conditions that occur for higher injected fluxes: (1) where runaway electrons become significant, and (2) where current-driven instabilities might become significant, requiring a model that self-consistently accounts for them. Condition 2 is relaxed and the energy flux losses are reduced in the presence of runaway electrons. All results are dependent on beam and cospatial plasma parameters. We also examine the importance of the reflection of beam electrons by the return-current electric field. We show that the interpretation of a number of flares needs to be reviewed to account for the effects of return currents.

<title>Effects of Bursty Star Formation on [C ii] Line Intensity Mapping of High-redshift Galaxies</title>

<div> 高红移、星系形成、线强度映射、[C II] 158 微米线、突发星形成<br />
总结:<br />
研究发现，在高红移星系中突发星形成现象普遍存在，表现为[C II] 158 微米线的强度映射。为了理解突发星形成对[C II]线强度映射的影响，文章提出了一个解释高红移星系形成和[C II]信号的分析模型。该模型的结果显示，突发星形成对低质量星系的平均星形成率和[C II] 发光度有显著影响，并且在[C II]功率谱中会产生大尺度聚类项的显著过量。因此，在建模和分析早期宇宙中的[C II]数据集时，必须考虑突发性，并且在极端情况下，突发性的特征可能会被第一代实验如TIME、CONCERTO和CCAT-DSS所发现。 <div>
Bursty star formation—a key prediction for high-redshift galaxies from cosmological simulations explicitly resolving stellar feedback in the interstellar medium—has recently been observed to prevail among galaxies at redshift z ≳ 6. Line intensity mapping (LIM) of the 158 μm [C ii] line as a star formation rate (SFR) indicator offers unique opportunities to tomographically constrain cosmic star formation at high redshift, in a way complementary to observations of individually detected galaxies. To understand the effects of bursty star formation on [C ii] LIM, which have remained unexplored in previous studies, we present an analytic modeling framework for high-z galaxy formation and [C ii] LIM signals that accounts for bursty star formation histories induced by delayed supernova feedback. We use it to explore and characterize how bursty star formation can impact and thus complicate the interpretation of the [C ii] luminosity function and power spectrum. Our simple analytic model indicates that bursty star formation mainly affects low-mass galaxies by boosting their average SFR and [C ii] luminosity, and in the [C ii] power spectrum it can create a substantial excess in the large-scale clustering term. This distortion results in a power spectrum shape that cannot be explained by invoking a mass-independent logarithmic scatter. We conclude that burstiness must be accounted for when modeling and analyzing [C ii] data sets from the early Universe, and that in the extreme, the signature of burstiness may be detectable with first-generation experiments such as TIME, CONCERTO, and CCAT-DSS.

<div> 星际丰度，56Fe，NDAF，SNe Ia，化学丰度<br />
NDAF在太阳邻域的化学丰度演化中扮演重要角色，通过研究铁的演变和金属量比随着时间的变化，发现了NDAF对金属丰度的贡献。太阳邻域的金属丰度在SNe Ia之前逐渐增加，在考虑NDAF的情况下，由于铁的增加，金属贫乏星的金属量分布得到改善，而且还能够复现观测到的[Mg/Fe]的演变。这些结果深入理解了太阳环境中金属丰度的演化。 <br /><br />总结: <br />核崩解超新星在早期起主导作用，而Ia型超新星在后期起主导作用；NDAF对金属丰度的贡献尤为重要；NDAF的考虑改善了金属贫乏星的金属量分布；NDAF可复现[Mg/Fe]的观测到的演变变化；进一步加深了对太阳环境中金属丰度演化的理解。 <div>
The elemental abundances of stars reflect the complex enrichment history of the Galaxy. To explore and explain the metal enrichment history of the cosmic environment near our solar system, we study the evolution of 56Fe abundance over time and [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] evolution in the solar neighborhood. Core-collapse supernovae make the dominant contribution in the early stages, while Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have a delayed and dominant impact in the later stages. In this work, we consider the nucleosynthesis contribution of neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs) formed at the end of the lives of massive stars. The results show that the [Fe/H] gradually increases over time and eventually reaches [Fe/H] = 0 and above, reproducing the chemical enrichment process in the solar neighborhood. Before the onset of SNe Ia, the ratio of 56Fe mass to the total gas mass increases by a factor of at most ∼1.44 when NDAFs are taken into account. We find that by including NDAF in our models, the agreement with the observed metallicity distribution of metal-poor stars in the solar neighborhood (<1 kpc) is improved while not significantly altering the location of the metallicity peak. This inclusion can also reproduce the observed evolutionary change of [Mg/Fe] at [Fe/H] ∼ −1.22, bringing the ratio to match the solar abundance. Our results provide an extensive understanding of metallicity evolution in solar environments by highlighting the nucleosynthesis contribution of NDAF outflows in the solar neighborhood.

<div> 前景窄线射电星系，背景亚毫米星系，MMT/Binospec，Hubble Space Telescope，Chandra。

领先的狭窄射线射电星系（“星系A”，zA = 0.6850）镜像了一个背景亚毫米星系（zSMG = 2.221）的罕见情况。MMT/Binospec的新光谱证实了伴星系（“星系B”）是镜像系统的一部分，其zB = 0.6835。Hubble Space Telescope的新的三色数据显示完整的爱因斯坦环，并允许更精确的透镜模型。新的HST图像还显示了星系A周围的扩展发射，光谱显示出不规则形态的扩展[O ii]发射和复杂的速度结构。所有迹象表明，两个透镜星系是一个引力相互作用的对。星系A和B的强烈[O ii]发射表明目前有恒星形成，这可能是相互作用的结果。这表明比以前假设的更年轻的恒星群，并暗示了相同亮度的较小恒星质量。改进的透镜模型和扩展的光谱能够更好地估算前景星系的恒星质量。由此得出的暗物质部分约为0.8，比以前计算的要高。更深入的Chandra成像显示了扩展的X射线发射，但没有证据表明与任何星系相关的X射线点源。从3C 220.3的射电叶发射检测出X射线，估计叶中磁场约为3 nT，这是典型射电星系的平衡场的大约3倍。 <br /><br />总结: 3C 220.3系统是一个罕见的案例，其中前景窄线射电星系镜像了一个背景亚毫米星系。透镜模型经过改进，能够更好地估算前景星系的恒星质量，得出的暗物质部分约为0.8。而深入的Chandra成像显示了扩展的X射线发射，但没有与任何星系相关的X射线点源。 <div>
The 3C 220.3 system is a rare case of a foreground narrow-line radio galaxy (“galaxy A,” zA = 0.6850) lensing a background submillimeter galaxy (zSMG = 2.221). New spectra from MMT/Binospec confirm that the companion galaxy (“galaxy B”) is part of the lensing system with zB = 0.6835. New three-color Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data reveal a full Einstein ring and allow a more precise lens model. The new HST images also reveal extended emission around galaxy A, and the spectra show extended [O ii] emission with irregular morphology and complex velocity structure. All indications are that the two lensing galaxies are a gravitationally interacting pair. Strong [O ii] emission from both galaxies A and B suggests current star formation, which could be a consequence of the interaction. This would indicate a younger stellar population than previously assumed and imply smaller stellar masses for the same luminosity. The improved lens model and expanded spectral energy distributions have enabled better stellar mass estimates for the foreground galaxies. The resulting dark matter fractions are ∼0.8, which are higher than previously calculated. Deeper Chandra imaging shows extended X-ray emission but no evidence for an X-ray point source associated with either galaxy. The detection of X-rays from the radio lobes of 3C 220.3 allows an estimate of ∼3 nT for the magnetic fields in the lobes, a factor of ∼3 below the equipartition fields, as is typical for radio galaxies.

Enzo-N是一个GPU加速的混合流体/ N体模拟代码，通过半静态背景加速度近似成功地模拟了星团和宿主星系的共同演化。 Enzo-N的创新之处在于将直接N体模拟代码集成到宇宙学（磁）流体动力学代码中，捕捉了星团的核心坍缩和潮汐剥离等重要现象。这一全面的框架为研究星团在星系中的演化提供了新的可能性，提供了以前无法获得的见解。 <div>
We introduce a GPU-accelerated hybrid hydro/N-body code (Enzo-N) designed to address the challenges of concurrently simulating star clusters and their parent galaxies. This task has been exceedingly challenging, primarily due to the considerable computational time required, which stems from the substantial scale difference between galaxies (∼0.1 Mpc) and star clusters (∼parsecs). Yet, this significant scale separation means that particles within star clusters perceive those outside the star cluster in a semistationary state. By leveraging this aspect, we integrate a direct N-body code (Nbody6++GPU) into a cosmological (magneto)hydrodynamic code (Enzo) through utilization of the semistationary background acceleration approximation. We solve the dynamics of particles within star clusters using a direct N-body solver with regularization for few-body interactions, while evolving particles outside—dark matter, gas, and stars—using a particle-mesh gravity solver and hydrodynamic methods. We demonstrate that Enzo-N successfully simulates the coevolution of star clusters and their parent galaxies, capturing phenomena such as core collapse of the star cluster and tidal stripping due to galactic tides. This comprehensive framework opens up new possibilities for studying the evolution of star clusters within galaxies, offering insights that were previously inaccessible.

这篇文章讨论了在最冷的棕矮星和外行星上，水必须凝结成冰云的问题。研究发现，云的性质受复杂微物理过程的影响，但这些复杂性通常无法被气候模型或检索模型中使用的简单参数化云模型所捕获。为了解决这一问题，研究者将微物理云模拟和一维气候模拟相结合，以将微物理模型的见解纳入一个自洽的参数化云模型中。研究结果表明，将微物理知识纳入参数化云模型可以更好地生成未来冷的次恒星对象的水云模型。 <div>
Water must condense into ice clouds in the coldest brown dwarfs and exoplanets. When they form, these icy clouds change the emergent spectra, temperature structure, and albedo of the substellar atmosphere. The properties of clouds are governed by complex microphysics but these complexities are often not captured by the simpler parameterized cloud models used in climate models or retrieval models. Here, we combine microphysical cloud modeling and 1D climate modeling to incorporate insights from microphysical models into a self-consistent, parameterized cloud model. Using the 1D Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA), we generate microphysical water clouds and compare their properties with those from the widely used EddySed cloud model for a grid of Y dwarfs. We find that the mass of water condensate in our CARMA water clouds is significantly limited by available condensation nuclei; in models without additional seed particles for clouds added, the atmosphere becomes supersaturated. We incorporate water latent heat release in the convective and radiative parts of the atmosphere and find no significant impact on water-ice cloud formation for typical gas giant compositions. Our analysis reveals the CARMA cloud profiles have a gradual decrease in opacity of approximately 4% per bar below the cloud base. Incorporating this gradual cloud base falloff and a variable fsed parameter allows spectra generated from the parameterized Eddysed model to better match those of the microphysical CARMA model. This work provides recommendations for efficiently generating microphysically informed water clouds for future models of cold substellar objects with H/He atmospheres.

该研究通过测量M82的星系晕端星形成结束时间（t90）和金属丰度（[M/H]）以及NGC 3077的东部潮汐尾的特征，来验证M82是否具有真正的星系晕，确定NGC 3077的潮汐破碎是否与星形成历史有关，以及创建M81星系群中心三个星系的组装历史时间表。研究结果表明，M82具有一个真正的金属贫瘠星系晕，形成于约66亿年前的一个小卫星星系的合并过程。NGC 3077潮汐尾中的恒星形成在与M81之前，且金属丰度大致均匀，表明NGC 3077的原型具有显著的人群梯度。最后，该研究呈现了中心三星系的并购/相互作用历史时间表。 <div>
Mergers of and interactions between galaxies imprint a wide diversity of morphological, dynamical, and chemical characteristics in stellar halos and tidal streams. Measuring these characteristics elucidates aspects of the progenitors of the galaxies we observe today. The M81 group is the perfect galaxy group to understand the past, present, and future of a group of galaxies in the process of merging. Here, we measure the end of star formation (t90) and metallicity ([M/H]) of the stellar halo of M82 and the eastern tidal stream of NGC 3077 to: (1) test the idea that M82 possesses a genuine stellar halo, formed before any interaction with M81; (2) determine if NGC 3077's tidal disruption is related to the star formation history in its tails; and (3) create a timeline of the assembly history of the central trio in the M81 group. We argue that M82 possesses a genuine, metal-poor ([M/H] ∼ −1.62 dex) stellar halo, formed from the merger of a small satellite galaxy roughly 6.6 Gyr ago. We also find that the stars present in NGC 3077's tails formed before tidal disruption with M81, and possess a roughly uniform metallicity as shown in S. Okamoto et al., implying that NGC 3077's progenitor had significant population gradients. Finally, we present a timeline of the central trio’s merger/interaction history.

<div> 频率选择，天空遮蔽，Planck 2018温度数据，透镜异常，宇宙学模型

总结：<br /><br />这篇文章重新审视了Planck 2018年温度（TT）数据中的透镜异常，并检查了其对频率选择和额外天空遮蔽的稳健性。研究的主要发现包括：（1）现象学的透镜振幅参数AL随黄道纬度变化，在黄道附近有AL>1的2.9σ偏好，在黄道极附近有1.0σ偏好，这种行为主要源自或完全源自217 GHz，暗示了一些非随机效应。 （2）217 GHz的TT数据也显示出比较低频率更强的AL>1的偏好。从217 GHz数据中剔除银河尘埃遮罩后的AL变化过大，不能仅仅用统计波动来解释，表明与前景处理有关。总体来看，Planck AL异常并非单一简单原因所致。从217 GHz TT数据中删除后，AL>1的偏好降至1.8σ。低多极（ℓ < 30）的TT数据通过与ΛCDM参数的相关性贡献了AL>1的偏好。在ℓ≥30时，100和143 GHz的数据对AL>1的偏好达到1.3σ，且在我们进行的遮蔽测试中似乎很稳健。透镜异常可能影响对替代宇宙学模型的拟合。通过对Planck TT谱线可选地应用AL边缘化可以检查这一点。提出用于解决宇宙学张力的模型应对Planck 217 GHz TT数据的剔除具有稳健性。 <div>
We revisit the lensing anomaly in the Planck 2018 temperature (TT) data and examine its robustness to frequency selection and additional sky masking. Our main findings are as follows. (1) The phenomenological lensing amplitude parameter, AL, varies with ecliptic latitude, with a 2.9σ preference for AL > 1 near the ecliptic and 1.0σ preference near the ecliptic poles, compared to 2.5σ on the original masks. This behavior is largely or solely from 217 GHz and suggestive of some nonrandom effect, given the Planck scan strategy. (2) The 217 GHz TT data also show a stronger preference for AL > 1 than the lower frequencies. The shifts in AL from 217 GHz with additional Galactic dust masking are too large to be explained solely by statistical fluctuations, indicating some connection with the foreground treatment. Overall, the Planck AL anomaly does not have a single simple cause. Removing the 217 GHz TT data leaves a 1.8σ preference for AL > 1. The low-multipole (ℓ < 30) TT data contribute to the preference for AL > 1 through correlations with ΛCDM parameters. The 100 and 143 GHz data at ℓ ≥ 30 prefer AL > 1 at 1.3σ, and this appears robust to the masking tests we performed. The lensing anomaly may impact fits to alternative cosmological models. Marginalizing over AL, optionally applied only to Planck TT spectra, can check this. Models proposed to address cosmological tensions should be robust to removal of the Planck 217 GHz TT data.

The first generations of stars left their chemical fingerprints on metal-poor stars in the Milky Way and its surrounding dwarf galaxies. While instantaneous and homogeneous enrichment implies that groups of conatal stars should have the same element abundances, small amplitudes of abundance scatter are seen at fixed [Fe/H]. Measurements of intrinsic abundance scatter have been made with small high-resolution spectroscopic data sets where measurement uncertainty is small compared to this scatter. In this work, we present a method to use mid-resolution survey data, which have larger errors, to make this measurement. Using APOGEE Data Release 17, we calculate the intrinsic scatter of Al, O, Mg, Si, Ti, Ni, and Mn relative to Fe for 333 metal-poor stars across six classical dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way, and 1604 stars across 19 globular clusters (GCs). We calibrate the reported abundance errors in bins of signal-to-noise ratio and [Fe/H] using a high-fidelity halo data set. Applying these calibrated errors to the APOGEE data, we find small amplitudes of average intrinsic abundance scatter in dwarf galaxies ranging from 0.03 to 0.09 dex, with a median value of 0.047 dex. For the GCs, we find intrinsic scatters ranging from 0.01 to 0.11 dex, with particularly high scatter for Al and O. Our measurements of intrinsic abundance scatter place important upper bounds, which are limited by our calibration, on the intrinsic scatter in these systems, as well as constraints on their underlying star formation history and mixing that we can look to simulations to interpret.

IC 10 X-1 is one of the close X-ray binaries containing a Wolf–Rayet donor, which can provide an evolutionary link between high-mass X-ray binaries and gravitational wave sources. It is still unclear about the precise nature of the accreting compact object in IC 10 X-1, although it looks more like a black hole (BH) than a neutron star. In this work, we use a binary population synthesis method to simulate the formation of IC 10 X-1–like binaries by assuming different common-envelope ejection efficiencies. This work represents a big step forward over previous studies since we adopt new criteria for mass-transfer stability. These criteria allow the formation of IC 10 X-1–like systems without experiencing common envelope evolution. Based on our calculations, we propose that the compact object in IC 10 X-1 is a BH with a mass of ∼10–30 M⊙ and the progenitor evolution of this binary probably just experienced stable mass transfer.

We perform the asteroseismic fitting of four DAVs using a grid of WDEC models with chemical profiles that closely mimic those of the LPCODE models and compare them with published asteroseismic fitting results using the LPCODE. These four objects are KIC 11911480, J113655.17+040952.6, KIC 4552982, and GD 1212. The similarities in the results in those controlled experiments point to a consistency in the models. Given similar input, the LPCODE and the WDEC make similar models and calculate similar periods. We further perform the asteroseismic fitting of the same four DAVs by relaxing the constraints on the chemical profiles. We explore the effects of different methods for weighing the modes when calculating the goodness of fit of the models, as well as the effect of only including a subset of the known period spectrum. Such numerical experiments can help place recent and future efforts in the pipeline fitting of numerous DAVs and DBVs using the WDEC on a firmer footing.

<div> 关键词: 小麦云，红巨星分支，绝对校准，SARGs，变化性<br />
总结:<br />这篇文章研究了小麦云红巨星分支（TRGB）的绝对校准，使用了光学引力透镜实验（OGLE）分类的小幅度红巨星（SARGs）。研究表明，所有接近小麦云TRGB的星都是SARGs。通过区分A序列和B序列的年长和年轻红巨星，研究发现小麦云和大麦云的SARG族群存在许多相似之处，但也有显著的差异。利用变化性导出的信息，揭示了小麦云的年龄和金属丰度梯度，并表明其核心由年轻、金属丰富的红巨星组成。B序列提供了最明亮和最准确的校准（MF814W，syn = -4.057 ± 0.019(stat.) ± 0.029(syst.) mag），用于测量云彩之间的距离模数差异并研究金属度效应。未使用变化性信息的距离测量应采用基于靠近分支的所有星的SARG校准（MF814W，syn = -4.024 ± 0.041（stat.）± 0.029（syst.）mag）。这项工作强调红巨星群体多样性对TRGB距离测量的影响，需要进一步研究以揭示这些影响并改进TRGB标准化。 <div>
We investigate the absolute calibration of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using small amplitude red giant stars (SARGs) classified by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE). We show that all stars near the SMC’s TRGB are SARGs. Distinguishing older and younger RGs near the tip according to two period–luminosity sequences labeled A and B, we show many similarities among SARG populations of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the SMC, along with notable differences. In particular, SMC SARGs have shorter periods due to lower metallicity and smaller amplitudes due to younger ages than LMC SARGs. We discover two period–color relations near the TRGB that span all A-sequence and B-sequence stars in the OGLE-III footprints of the SMC and LMC, and we investigate using periods instead of color for TRGB standardization. Using variability-derived information only, we trace the SMC’s age and metallicity gradients and show the core to be populated by younger, more metal-rich RGs. The B-sequence yields the brightest and most accurate calibration (MF814W,syn = −4.057 ± 0.019(stat.) ± 0.029(syst.) mag), which we use to measure the distance modulus difference between the Clouds and investigate metallicity effects. Distance measurements not informed by variability should employ the SARG-based calibration based on all stars near the tip (MF814W,syn = −4.024 ± 0.041(stat.) ± 0.029(syst.) mag). Our work highlights the impact of RG population diversity on TRGB distance measurements. Further study is needed to unravel these effects and improve TRGB standardization.

<title>Balmer Decrement Anomalies in Galaxies at z ∼ 6 Found by JWST Observations: Density-bounded Nebulae or Excited H i Clouds?</title>

<div> 关键词: Balmer decrement anomalies, GS-NDG-9422, RXCJ2248-ID, z ∼ 6, physical modeling <br />
总结: 本研究调查了在z∼6的GS-NDG-9422和RXCJ2248-ID星系中氢的Hα/Hβ值明显小于2.7的巴尔默递减异常的物理起源。通过物理建模，发现了两种情况可以定量解释这些异常：(1) 具有小于Case B复合的光学深度的密度限制星云，(2) 部分/完全被光学厚的激发H i云所包围的电离限制星云。这些发现可能暗示了在高红移星系中由于大量吸积和超新星引起的过度碰撞激发的气体云。<br /> <div>
We investigate the physical origins of the Balmer decrement anomalies in GS-NDG-9422 and RXCJ2248-ID galaxies at z ∼ 6 whose Hα/Hβ values are significantly smaller than 2.7, the latter of which also shows anomalous Hγ/Hβ and Hδ/Hβ values beyond the errors. Because the anomalous Balmer decrements are not reproduced under the Case B recombination, we explore the nebulae with optical depths smaller and larger than the Case B recombination by physical modeling. We find two cases quantitatively explaining the anomalies: (1) density-bounded nebulae that are opaque only up to around Lyγ–Ly8 transitions and (2) ionization-bounded nebulae partly/fully surrounded by optically thick excited H i clouds. The case of (1) produces more Hβ photons via Lyγ absorption in the nebulae, requiring fine tuning in optical depth values, while this case helps ionizing photon escape for cosmic reionization. The case of (2) needs the optically thick excited Hi clouds with N2 ≃ 1012−1013 cm−2, where N2 is the column density of the hydrogen atom with the principal quantum number of n = 2. Interestingly, the high N2 values qualitatively agree with the recent claims for GS-NDG-9422 with the strong nebular continuum requiring a number of 2s-state electrons and for RXCJ2248-ID with the dense ionized regions likely coexisting with the optically thick clouds. While the physical origin of the optically thick excited H i clouds is unclear, these results may suggest gas clouds with excessive collisional excitation caused by an amount of accretion and supernovae in the high-z galaxies.

<div> 关键词: 大气层，热力锁定，外行星，朝晚各边，交接时间<br />
总结:<br />
本文讨论了大气不均一性对过境时间测量精度的影响，特别是对朝晚各边巨大温差的热力锁定外行星。研究指出，对于James Webb太空望远镜的观测来说，朝晚各边对总体透射光谱的贡献可以在一定情况下被准确分离。然而，大气不均一性与行星交接时间的不确定性之间存在高度重叠，可能导致对于大气不均一性的准确研究。文章推导了一个描述大气不均一性对视为交接时间变化的通用公式，并得出这种变化可能高达十秒。此外，文章还推导了一个关于这种额外数值偏差的分析公式。这些公式可以应用于新观测的计划或解释文献的测量结果，并给出了常见外行星的例子。 <div>
Atmospheres are not spatially homogeneous. This is particularly true for hot, tidally locked exoplanets with large day-to-night temperature variations, which can yield significant differences between the morning and evening terminators—known as limb asymmetry. Current transit observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are precise enough to disentangle the separate contributions of these morning and evening limbs to the overall transmission spectrum in certain circumstances. However, the signature of limb asymmetry in a transit light curve is highly degenerate with uncertainty in the planet’s time of conjunction. This raises the question of how precisely transit times must be measured to enable accurate studies of limb asymmetry, in particular with JWST. Although this degeneracy has been discussed in the literature, a general description of it has not been presented. In this work, we show how this degeneracy results from apparent changes in the transit contact times when the planetary disk has asymmetric limb sizes. We derive a general formula relating the magnitude of limb asymmetry to the amount by which it would cause the apparent time of conjunction to vary, which can reach tens of seconds. Comparing our formula to simulated observations, we find that numerical fitting techniques add additional bias to the measured time, of generally less than a second, resulting from the occultation geometry. We also derive an analytical formula for this extra numerical bias. These formulae can be applied to planning new observations or interpreting literature measurements, and we show examples for commonly studied exoplanets.

<title>Multispacecraft Observations of Protons and Helium Nuclei in Some Solar Energetic Particle Events toward the Maximum of Cycle 25</title>

The intricate behavior of particle acceleration and transport mechanisms complicates the overall efforts in formulating a comprehensive understanding of solar energetic particle (SEP) events; these efforts include observations of low-energy particles (from tens of keV to hundreds of MeV) by space-borne instruments and measurements by the ground-based neutron monitors of the secondary particles generated in the Earth atmosphere by SEPs in the GeV range. Numerous space-borne missions provided good data on the nature/characteristics of these solar particles in past solar cycles, but more recently—concurrently with the rise toward the maximum of solar cycle 25—the High-Energy Particle Detector (HEPD-01) proved to be well suited for the study of solar physics and space weather. Its nominal 30–300 MeV energy range for protons can enlarge the detection capabilities of solar particles at low Earth orbit, closer to the injection limit of many SEP events. In this work, we characterize three SEP events within the first six months of 2022 through spectral and velocity dispersion analysis, assessing the response of HEPD-01 to >M1 events.

<title>Anisotropies of 40–139 keV Ions Measured beyond the Termination Shock and in the Very Local Interstellar Medium</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad7601</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We analyze the count rates of 40–139 keV ions that were measured in situ by the Low Energy Charged Particle instrument on Voyager 1 in order to identify the suprathermal ion anisotropies beyond the termination shock and in the very local interstellar (IS) medium (VLISM). The analysis results in a region of ∼9–10 au before the heliopause (HP) where the radial anisotropy of ions is negative, while the azimuthal ion anisotropy inside the heliosheath lies in the −T direction. In agreement to our previous analyses, we identify a positive radial anisotropy of ions up to at least ∼30 au beyond the HP, which becomes nearly zero from 2021 up to 2023 November (for ∼10 au). Notably, the anisotropy in the azimuthal direction is statistically zero throughout the upstream region, i.e., for ∼40 au past the HP, showing that the 40–139 keV ion anisotropy in the VLISM is only in the radial direction and has no azimuthal component. The presence of suprathermal ions of solar origin over such long spatial scales in the VLISM, along with the inflow of ions from IS space into the heliosheath, are important constraints for characterizing the interaction of the heliosheath with the VLISM. Our observations provide indications that V1 has entered a new regime in the VLISM since (at least) the year 2021, progressively developing characteristics akin to the pristine IS medium. Alternatively, this drop to nearly zero radial anisotropies beyond 2021 could be a manifestation of a prolonged compression/shock of solar origin.

<title>Very Extended Ionized Gas Discovered around NGC 1068 with the Circumgalactic Hα Spectrograph</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad6cd1</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have performed wide-field, ultra-low-surface-brightness Hα emission-line mapping around NGC 1068 with the newly commissioned Circumgalactic Hα Spectrograph. NGC 1068 is notable for its active galactic nucleus, which globally ionizes gas in the disk and halo. Line-emitting diffuse ionized gas is distributed throughout the galactic disk and large-scale ionized filaments are found well beyond the disk, aligned with the cone angle of the central jet. We report the discovery of a new ribbon of ionized gas around NGC 1068 beyond even the known outer filamentary structure, located 20 kpc from the galaxy. The Hα surface brightness of this ribbon is on the order of the bright telluric lines, ranging from 4 to 16 R, with fainter regions on the order of the sky background continuum. Unlike previous extended emission, the ribbon is not as well aligned with the current axis of the central jet. It is not associated with any galactic structure or known tidal features in the halo of NGC 1068, though it may originate from a larger distribution of unmapped neutral atomic or molecular gas in the halo. The morphology of the ribbon emission in Hα is correlated with extended UV emission around NGC 1068. Hα-to-UV flux ratios in the ribbon are comparable to extended emission-line ratios in the halos of NGC 5128, NGC 253, and M82. The Hα excess in the ribbon gas suggests ionization by slow shocks or a mixture of in situ star formation and photoionization and collisional ionization processes.

这篇研究模拟了太阳耀斑极紫外晚期阶段对电离层电子密度的影响，使用了真实观测到的2012年10月23日X1.8级耀斑的太阳光谱驱动离子层-热层耦合模型。全球总电子含量（TEC）的观测和模拟显示，在极紫外晚期，白天电离层的TEC增加超过了耀斑主要阶段。研究还检验了模型在具有极紫外晚期的耀斑中的性能。结果显示，F层电子密度增强和恢复不能以与极紫外晚期的时间变化相同的速度变化，并且极紫外晚期的存在延长了电子密度的恢复约9小时。研究还发现，电子密度增强主要由化学产生决定，而电子密度的恢复主要受电场输运效应控制。这项研究加深了对地球空间环境和太阳耀斑极紫外晚期事件中类似行星系统的复杂物理和光化学过程的理解。

<br /><br />总结: 
1. 研究模拟了太阳耀斑极紫外晚期对电离层电子密度的影响
2. 使用真实观测到的太阳光谱驱动模型进行了研究
3. 结果显示极紫外晚期比耀斑主要阶段更能影响白天电离层的电子密度
4. 极紫外晚期的存在延长了电子密度的恢复时间
5. 电子密度的增强主要受化学产生影响，而恢复主要受电场输运效应控制。 <div>
Effects of the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) late phase of solar flares on the ionosphere were rarely studied. Here we simulated such effects on the ionospheric electron density using an ionosphere−thermosphere coupled model driven by the realistic solar spectrum observed during the X1.8 flare on 2012 October 23. Global total electron content (TEC) observations and simulations showed that the dayside ionospheric TEC during the EUV late phase increased more than that of the flare’s main phase. We examined the performance of the model for flares with EUV late phase. The results showed that the F-region electron density enhancement and recovery did not vary in the same pace as the temporal variations of the EUV late phase, and the presence of the EUV late phase prolonged the recovery of electron density by ∼9 hr. We also found that the enhancement in electron density was mainly determined by the chemical production, while the recovery of electron density was primarily controlled by the electric field transport effects. This study enhanced understanding of the intricate physical and photochemical processes governing Earth’s space environment and similar planetary systems during solar flare events with EUV late phase.

<div> 关键词: heliospheric current sheets, Voyager 2, solar maximum periods, magnetic reconnection, Parker spiral field

总结: 
本研究利用2008年至2018年间Voyager 2探测器的观测数据，对太阳风层中的赤道面电流片（HCSs）进行了分析。通过严格的标准，共发现了34个HCSs，这些变化表明磁极性发生了显著变化。这些现象在太阳活动最大期间更为普遍，当HCS扩展到较高的纬度时，与太空飞船平均定位在太阳赤道平面以南31°的纬度相吻合。我们确定了识别的HCS大尺度结构的某些特征。最重要的是，使用两种不同的方法表明，在太阳风层中HCS的厚度范围在0.003到0.4天文单位（au），平均厚度约为0.03到0.1 au，具体取决于事件选择和拟合技术。这个厚度超过了1 au或其他太阳风层距离时所知的厚度。这也明显比典型的质子惯性长度厚，暗示了磁重联的不利条件。此外，我们的分析揭示了HCS平面相对于太阳赤道平面的频繁倾斜，倾斜角度可高达数十度，可能意味着HCS在太阳风层内部常见的扭曲结构。从纵向上看，HCS平面与太阳风层中预期的Parker螺旋场方向紧密对齐。最后，对于识别的HCS事件的大部分，HCS平面可能具有旋转不连续性。这些发现在本研究中使用的1小时分辨率数据的限制范围内是有效的。 <div>
In this paper, we conducted an analysis of the heliospheric current sheets (HCSs) in the heliosheath (HS), utilizing observations by Voyager 2 between 2008 and 2018. Employing rigorous criteria, we identified a total of 34 HCSs that indicate significant changes in magnetic polarity. These occurrences were more prevalent during solar maximum periods when the HCS expanded to higher latitudes, coinciding with the spacecraft positioned at an average latitude of −31° from the solar equator. We determined certain features of the large-scale structures of the identified HCSs. Most importantly, employing two distinct methods indicates that the thickness of the HCSs within the HS ranges from ∼0.003 to ∼0.4 au with an average thickness of ∼0.03 to ∼0.1 au, depending on methods of event selection and fitting techniques. This thickness surpasses that known near 1 au or other heliospheric distances. It is also notably thicker than the typical proton inertial length, implying unfavorable conditions for magnetic reconnection. Additionally, our analysis reveals a frequent tilt of HCS planes relative to the solar equatorial plane by a varying angle up to several tens of degrees, likely implying a common occurrence of a warped structure of the HCS within the HS. Longitudinally, the HCS planes closely align with the Parker spiral field direction expected in the HS. Finally, for a large fraction of the identified HCS events, the HCS planes are likely characterized by a rotational discontinuity. These findings are valid within the limits of the 1 hr resolution data used in this study.

<div> 快速射电暴，窄带谱，角尺寸，多普勒效应，等离子体透镜

FRB的一些观测显示，它们的频谱非常窄，即Δν/ν0 ≪ 1。当射电暴的发射区域的角尺寸大于多普勒束缚角时，由于高纬度效应，观测到的谱宽(Δν/ν0)超过0.58，即使在源点的共动框架中谱线很窄。对于FRB的磁层模型，源的角尺寸可以小于多普勒束缚角，这种几何效应不会影响观测到的带宽。我们讨论了各种传播效应，以确定是否有任何可能将宽频谱射电脉冲转换为观测者位置的窄频谱信号。我们发现等离子体透镜和涟漪效应可能导致观测频谱的窄带宽。然而，在观测到的大量FRB样本中，具有Δν/ν0 < 0.58的窄谱观测谱的现象产生的可能性非常小。

<br /><br />总结：
本研究发现，一些快速射电暴具有极窄的频谱，即Δν/ν0 ≪ 1。在射电暴的发射区域的角尺寸大于多普勒束缚角时，由于高纬度效应，观测到的谱宽(Δν/ν0)超过0.58。磁层模型下，源的角尺寸可以小于多普勒束缚角。等离子体透镜和涟漪效应可能导致观测频谱的窄带宽。然而，在大量FRB样本中，出现具有Δν/ν0 < 0.58的窄谱观测谱的可能性非常小。 <div>
Observations find that some fast radio bursts (FRBs) have extremely narrowband spectra, i.e., Δν/ν0 ≪ 1. We show that, when the angular size of the emission region is larger than the Doppler beaming angle, the observed spectral width (Δν/ν0) exceeds 0.58 due to the high-latitude effects for a source outside the magnetosphere, even when the spectrum in the source’s comoving frame is monochromatic. The angular size of the source for magnetospheric models of FRBs can be smaller than the Doppler beaming angle, in which case this geometric effect does not influence the observed bandwidth. We discuss various propagation effects to determine if any could transform a broad-spectrum radio pulse into a narrow spectrum signal at the observer’s location. We find that plasma lensing and scintillation can result in a narrow bandwidth in the observed spectrum. However, the likelihood of these phenomena being responsible for the narrow observed spectra with Δν/ν0 < 0.58 in the fairly large observed sample of FRBs is exceedingly small.

GRB的射电传输计算对于理解射流、紧凑天体和宇宙学具有重要意义，但其即时发射的不完全了解限制了其作为这些现象探测的应用。存在许多模型可解释伽玛射线和X射线能量范围内对GRB的各种观测，但这些模型缺乏对将来电磁谱观测的预测能力。本研究利用MCRaT辐射传输代码计算了两个长GRB的独特流体动力学模拟对应的X射线光谱偏振特征。我们进行了X射线和伽玛射线的时分辨和时间综合对比，揭示了X射线即时发射特征所能提供的信息。研究结果显示，从X射线光曲线导出的T90是最好的诊断中心引擎活动时间的方法。我们还发现我们的模拟复现了Einstein探测器探测到的GRB 240315C的特征。基于我们的模拟，我们还能对未来的X射线光谱测量进行预测。我们的结果表明进行GRB射流全局辐射传输计算对于更好地理解即时发射观测，并约束产生即时发射的机制至关重要。<br /><br />总结: GRB的即时发射具有重要意义，在不完全了解的情况下通过X射线光谱偏振特征进行计算和预测，可以更好地理解其特征和限制即时发射的机制。 <div>
While gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have the potential to shed light on the astrophysics of jets, compact objects, and cosmology, a major set back in their use as probes of these phenomena stems from our incomplete knowledge surrounding their prompt emission. There are numerous models that can account for various observations of GRBs in the gamma-ray and X-ray energy ranges, due to the flexibility in the number of parameters that can be tuned to increase agreement with data. Furthermore, these models lack predictive power that can test future spectropolarimetric observations of GRBs across the electromagnetic spectrum. In this work, we use the MCRaT radiative transfer code to calculate the X-ray spectropolarimetric signatures expected from the photospheric model for two unique hydrodynamic simulations of long GRBs. We make time-resolved and time-integrated comparisons between the X-ray and gamma-ray mock observations, shedding light on the information that can be obtained from X-ray prompt emission signatures. Our results show that the T90 derived from the X-ray light curve is the best diagnostic for the time that the central engine is active. We also find that our simulations reproduce the observed characteristics of the Einstein Probe–detected GRB 240315C. Based on our simulations, we are also able to make predictions for future X-ray spectropolarimetric measurements. Our results show the importance of conducting global radiative transfer calculations of GRB jets to better contextualize the prompt emission observations and constrain the mechanisms that produce the prompt emission.

We present an enhanced version of the publicly available Stripe 82X catalog (S82-XL), featuring a comprehensive set of 22,737 unique X-ray point sources identified with a significance ≳4σ. This catalog is four times larger than the original Stripe 82X catalog, by including additional archival data from the Chandra and XMM-Newton telescopes. Now covering ∼54.8 deg2 of nonoverlapping sky area, the S82-XL catalog roughly doubles the area and depth of the original catalog, with limiting fluxes (half-area fluxes) of 3.4 × 10−16 (2.4 × 10−15), 2.9 × 10−15 (1.5 × 10−14), and 1.4 × 10−15 (9.5 × 10−15) erg s−1 cm−2 across the soft (0.5–2 keV), hard (2–10 keV), and full (0.5–10 keV) bands, respectively. S82-XL occupies a unique region of flux-area parameter space compared to other X-ray surveys, identifying sources with rest-frame luminosities from 1.2 × 1038 to 1.6 × 1047 erg s−1 in the 2–10 keV band (median X-ray luminosity, 7.2 × 1043 erg s−1), and spectroscopic redshifts up to z ∼ 6. By using hardness ratios, we derived the obscuration of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), obtaining a median value of and an overall, obscured fraction ( ) of ∼36.9%. S82-XL serves as a benchmark in X-ray surveys and, with its extensive multiwavelength data, is especially valuable for comprehensive studies of luminous AGNs.

该研究提出了一个分析双锥吸积模型，用于对低亮度活动星系核的视界尺度图像进行分析，包括事件视界望远镜（EHT）观测到的核心。研究的模型是基于一个轴对称的、磁化等离子体的同步辐射，该等离子体被限制在沿黑洞自旋轴对齐的两个相对定向的锥形结构内流动。研究表明，该模型能够准确复现各种时间平均的广义相对论磁流体力学模拟的图像，并且能够在贝叶斯推断框架下，使用射电干涉数据准确获得这些模拟中的黑洞自旋、方向、辐射尺度高度、峰值辐射半径和流体流向。此外，研究发现，对于稀疏阵列观测（如EHT 2017年对M87*的观测），相对论吸积流图像中的非平凡拓扑结构可能导致多模态解。这些重叠性的存在强调了使用贝叶斯技术对EHT测量结果进行充分取样的重要性。研究将模型拟合到M87*的EHT观测数据中，并得出质量与距离比θg ∈ (2.84, 3.75) μas的95%最高后验密度区间，并给出一个倾斜角度θo ∈ (11°, 24°)。这些新的测量结果与EHT和恒星动力学估计的质量测量以及M87*射流性质推断的自旋轴倾斜角度一致。<br /><br />总结: 该研究提出了一种用于分析活动星系核的视界尺度图像的分析模型，并在贝叶斯推断框架下对模拟和观测的数据进行了准确拟合，获得了与其他方法一致的结果。研究结果强调了使用贝叶斯技术对EHT测量结果进行充分取样的重要性。 <div>
We propose an analytic dual-cone accretion model for horizon-scale images of the cores of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei, including those observed by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Our model is of synchrotron emission from an axisymmetric, magnetized plasma, constrained to flow within two oppositely oriented cones that are aligned with the black hole’s spin axis. We show this model can accurately reproduce images of a variety of time-averaged general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations and that it accurately recovers the black hole spin, orientation, emission scale height, peak emission radius, and fluid flow direction from these simulations within a Bayesian inference framework using radio interferometric data. We show that nontrivial topologies in the images of relativistic accretion flows around black holes can result in nontrivial multimodal solutions when applied to observations with a sparse array, such as the EHT 2017 observations of M87*. The presence of these degeneracies underscores the importance of employing Bayesian techniques to adequately sample the posterior space for the interpretation of EHT measurements. We fit our model to the EHT observations of M87* and find a 95% highest posterior density interval for the mass-to-distance ratio of θg ∈ (2.84, 3.75) μas, and give an inclination of θo ∈ (11°, 24°). These new measurements are consistent with mass measurements from the EHT and stellar dynamical estimates and with the spin axis inclination inferred from properties of the M87* jet.

<div> 重复快速射电爆发，X射线和无线电观测，FRB 20220912A，X射线和无线电数据，观测方法，观测结果<br /><br />总结:
本研究对重复快速射电爆发源FRB 20220912A进行了为期8周的X射线和无线电观测。观测结果显示，在30次射电爆发期间未检测到显著的X射线发射，并且根据推断，X射线与射电的能量比值(ηx/r)小于7 × 10^6。此外，在FRB 20220912A的位置上也未观测到持续的X射线发射。研究还提出了一种层次化方法，可结合多次观测数据，得出了截至目前关于FRB ηx/r的最佳上界。最后，如果采用类似于2020年4月28日观测到的银河磁星SGR 1935+2154的X射线谱，将得出ηx/r的上界为8 × 10^5，仅为SGR 1935+2154观测到的ηx/r的3倍。 <div>
We present an extensive contemporaneous X-ray and radio campaign performed on the repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source FRB 20220912A for 8 weeks immediately following the source’s detection by CHIME/FRB. This includes X-ray data from XMM-Newton, NICER, and Swift, and radio detections of FRB 20220912A from CHIME/Pulsar and Effelsberg. We detect no significant X-ray emission at the time of 30 radio bursts with upper limits on a 0.5–10.0 keV X-ray fluence of (1.5–14.5) × 10−10 erg cm−2 (99.7% credible interval, unabsorbed) on a timescale of 100 ms. Translated into a fluence ratio ηx/r = FX-ray/Fradio, this corresponds to ηx/r < 7 × 106. For persistent emission from the location of FRB 20220912A, we derive a 99.7% 0.5–10.0 keV isotropic flux limit of 8.8 × 10−15 erg cm−2 s−1 (unabsorbed) or an isotropic luminosity limit of 1.4 × 1041 erg s−1 at a distance of 362.4 Mpc. We derive a hierarchical extension to the standard Bayesian treatment of low-count and background-contaminated X-ray data, which allows the robust combination of multiple observations. This methodology allows us to place the best (lowest) 99.7% credible interval upper limit on an FRB ηx/r to date, ηx/r < 2 × 106, assuming that all 30 detected radio bursts are associated with X-ray bursts with the same fluence ratio. If we instead adopt an X-ray spectrum similar to the X-ray burst observed contemporaneously with FRB-like emission from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 detected on 2020 April 28, we derive a 99.7% credible interval upper limit on ηx/r of 8 × 105, which is only 3 times the observed value of ηx/r for SGR 1935+2154.

Photometric classifications of supernova (SN) light curves have become necessary to utilize the full potential of large samples of observations obtained from wide-field photometric surveys, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. Here, we present a photometric classifier for SN light curves that does not rely on redshift information and still maintains comparable accuracy to redshift-dependent classifiers. Our new package, Superphot+, uses a parametric model to extract meaningful features from multiband SN light curves. We train a gradient-boosted machine with fit parameters from 6061 ZTF SNe that pass data quality cuts and are spectroscopically classified as one of five classes: SN Ia, SN II, SN Ib/c, SN IIn, and SLSN-I. Without redshift information, our classifier yields a class-averaged F1-score of 0.61 ± 0.02 and a total accuracy of 0.83 ± 0.01. Including redshift information improves these metrics to 0.71 ± 0.02 and 0.88 ± 0.01, respectively. We assign new class probabilities to 3558 ZTF transients that show SN-like characteristics (based on the ALeRCE Broker light-curve and stamp classifiers) but lack spectroscopic classifications. Finally, we compare our predicted SN labels with those generated by the ALeRCE light-curve classifier, finding that the two classifiers agree on photometric labels for 82% ± 2% of light curves with spectroscopic labels and 72% ± 0% of light curves without spectroscopic labels. Superphot+ is currently classifying ZTF SNe in real time via the ANTARES Broker, and is designed for simple adaptation to six-band Rubin light curves in the future.

<div> 关键词: 星速度分布，暗物质，高斯混合模型，银河系演化，动力学学习<br />
<br />
本研究利用数值模拟表明星体速度分布与暗物质之间存在相关性。通过高斯混合模型，在化学动力学空间中将来自LAMOST DR8和Gaia DR3的K型巨星分为盘状结构、暗物质晕及各向同性暗物质晕组分。发现暗物质晕的子结构组分在径向上具有很高的各向异性，可能与Gaia–Enceladus–Sausage(GES)并入事件有关，而各向同性暗物质晕组分是接收自最早的并入，并且服从Maxwell–Boltzmann分布(标准暗物质模型[SHM]).研究发现GES样子的子结构组分占据了太阳附近约85%的本地非盘星体数量，这一结果对于不同体积切割和额外角动量约束的应用几乎没有变化。通过利用金属丰度-恒星质量关系和恒星质量-暗物质晕质量关系，我们发现本地暗物质中约有25%存在于这种动力学子结构中。结合非盘组分的恒星分布，我们修正了本地暗物质的太阳系速度分布。与SHM相比，速度降低，峰值更尖锐，更新了暗物质直接探测实验的检测限。本研究还讨论了GMM拟合中存在的退化，并建议未来更多动力学和化学信息，如α丰度，有助于打破这种退化。我们的工作证实了本地暗物质速度分布显著偏离SHM，需要在暗物质探测实验中得到适当的考虑。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究利用高斯混合模型对银河系内的恒星进行动力学学习，发现本地暗物质晕存在着高度的子结构成分，并且这一组分对于本地暗物质速度分布产生了重大影响，需要在暗物质探测实验中加以充分考虑。 <div>
Numerical simulations indicate that correlations exist between the velocity distributions of stars and dark matter (DM). We study the local DM velocity distribution based on these correlations. We select K giants from LAMOST DR8 cross-matched with Gaia DR3, which have robust measurements of velocity and metallicity, and separate them into the disk, halo substructure, and isotropic halo components in the chemodynamical space utilizing the Gaussian mixture model. The substructure component is highly radially anisotropic and possibly related to the Gaia–Enceladus–Sausage (GES) merger event, while the isotropic halo component is accreted from the earliest mergers following the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution (standard halo model [SHM]). We find that the GES-like substructure contributes ∼85% of the local nondisk stars in the solar neighborhood, which is nearly invariant when applying different volume cuts or additional angular momentum constraints. Utilizing the metallicity–stellar mass relation and the stellar mass–halo mass relation, we find that of local DM is in the kinematic substructure. Combined with the stellar distributions of nondisk components, we modify the heliocentric velocity distribution of local DM. It shifts to a lower speed with a sharper peak compared to the SHM and updates the detection limits of DM direct detection experiments. We discuss extensively the degeneracies present in the GMM fitting and propose that more kinematic and chemical information such as α abundance could help to break the degeneracy in the future. Our work confirms that the local DM velocity distribution deviates significantly from the SHM and needs to be properly accounted for in the DM detection experiments.

<div> Athena++, Monte Carlo radiation transfer module, RMHD simulations, super-Eddington accretion, hard X-ray emission
<br />总结:
研究利用Athena++模拟了超艾丁顿吸积率对黑洞的影响，焦点在硬X射线发射上。他们通过MC和RMHD模拟的比较发现，RMHD模拟中的灰色辐射传输模型低估了喷口区域的气体温度，而多能组模拟更符合MC模拟的结果，并产生了硬X射线辐射比灰色模拟更强的后处理光谱。他们还使用MC后处理光谱尝试直接拟合超光源X射线源的观测数据，结果发现第一原理模型可以很好地解释观测到的硬X射线光谱。 <div>
We use the Athena++ Monte Carlo (MC) radiation transfer module to postprocess simulation snapshots from nonrelativistic Athena++ radiation magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations. These simulations were run using a gray (frequency-integrated) approach but were also restarted and ran with a multigroup approach that accounts for Compton scattering with a Kompaneets operator. These simulations produced moderately super-Eddington accretion rates onto a 6.62 M⊙ black hole. Since we only achieve inflow equilibrium out to 20–25 gravitational radii, we focus on the hard X-ray emission. We provide a comparison between the MC and RMHD simulations, showing that the treatment of Compton scattering in the gray RMHD simulations underestimates the gas temperature in the funnel regions above and below the accretion disk. In contrast, the restarted multigroup snapshots provide a treatment for the radiation field that is more consistent with the MC calculations, and result in postprocessed spectra with harder X-ray emission compared to their gray snapshot counterparts. We characterize these MC postprocessed spectra using commonly employed phenomenological spectral fitting models. We also attempt to fit our MC spectra directly to observations of the ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) NGC 1313 X-1, finding best-fit values that are competitive to phenomenological model fits, indicating that first principle models of super-Eddington accretion may adequately explain the observed hard X-ray spectra in some ULX sources.

流体动力学模拟显示，当给定一个超爱丁顿回落速率时，流-流碰撞可以发生多次，并产生高达10^4太阳质量每秒的强流出。这些流出将气体分散到≳100rs，延迟了气体的循环，并导致前几次流-流碰撞期间次爱丁顿的吸积速率。碰撞和循环的冲击可以在数天内维持约10^44尔格每秒的亮度。这个亮度通常是次爱丁顿的，并且在早期与吸积速率呈弱相关。流出是光学厚的，产生一个大小约10^14厘米、光球温度约4×10^4开尔文的辐射层。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究在流体动力学模拟中发现，潮撕裂事件的早期发射和气体循环受到流-流碰撞的影响。在给定的条件下，流-流碰撞可以产生强大的气体流出，并延迟气体的循环。同时，产生的光度通常是次爱丁顿的，并且与吸积速率呈弱相关。产生的光度主要受到流-流碰撞和循环的冲击影响，同时产生的流出是光学厚的，产生辐射层。 <div>
The rising part of a tidal disruption event light curve provides unique insight into early emission and the onset of accretion. Various mechanisms are proposed to explain the pre-peak emission, including shocks from debris interaction and reprocessing of disk emission. We study the pre-peak emission and its influence on the gas circularization by a series of gray radiation hydrodynamic simulations with varying black hole mass. We find that, given a super-Eddington fallback rate of , the stream–stream collision can occur multiple times and drive strong outflows of up to . By dispersing gas to ≳100rs, the outflow can delay gas circularization and leads to sub-Eddington accretion rates during the first few stream–stream collisions. The stream–stream collision shock and circularization shock can sustain a luminosity of ∼1044 erg s−1 for days. The luminosity is generally sub-Eddington and shows a weak correlation with accretion rate at early times. The outflow is optically thick, yielding a reprocessing layer with a size of ∼1014 cm and photospheric temperature of ∼4 × 104 K.

<div> 关键词: Type Ia supernovae, early-time light curves, excesses, Zwicky Transient Facility, Hubble residuals<br />
总结: <br /><br />这篇文章研究了Type Ia超新星早期光变曲线的多个理论模型和观测到的flux excesses，以及这些过量的影响。作者使用ZTF观测到的SNe Ia的光变曲线进行系统性搜索，发现了17个SNe Ia具有显著的早期过量。研究发现，具有过量的SNe Ia在经过形状、颜色和宿主星系质量的校正后可能具有较低的哈勃残差。作者还比较了具有过量和没有过量的SNe Ia的宿主星系质量，发现它们大致一致，尽管具有过量的SNe Ia可能更倾向于较低质量的宿主星系。这些发现提供了理解SN Ia宇宙学潜在偏见和探索SN Ia前体物理的有效方式。 <div>
Flux excesses in the early-time light curves of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are predicted by multiple theoretical models and have been observed in a number of nearby SNe Ia over the last decade. However, the astrophysical processes that cause these excesses may affect their use as standardizable candles for cosmological parameter measurements. We perform a systematic search for early-time excesses in SNe Ia observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to study whether SNe Ia with these excesses yield systematically different Hubble residuals. We analyze two compilations of SN Ia light curves from ZTF’s first year of operations: 127 high-cadence light curves from Y. Yao et al. and 305 light curves from the ZTF cosmology data release of S. Dhawan et al. We detect significant early-time excesses for 17 SNe Ia in these samples and find that the excesses have a median g − r color of 0.10 ± 0.11 mag; we do not find a clear preference for blue excesses as predicted by several models. Using the SALT3 model, we measure Hubble residuals for these two samples, finding that excess-having SNe Ia may have lower Hubble residuals (HR) after correcting for shape, color, and host-galaxy mass, at ∼2–3σ significance; our baseline result is ΔHR = −0.056 ± 0.026 mag (2.2σ). We compare the host-galaxy masses of excess-having and no-excess SNe Ia and find they are consistent, though at marginal significance excess-having SNe Ia may prefer lower-mass hosts. Additional discoveries of early excess SNe Ia will be a powerful way to understand potential biases in SN Ia cosmology and probe the physics of SN Ia progenitors.

Plumes are considered to play an important role in the origin of the solar wind. However, an understanding of their thermodynamic evolution is not complete. Here, we perform a detailed study of a plume inside a coronal hole throughout its lifetime, using the observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager. We find that the plume’s formation is preceded by frequent occurrences of small-scale jets and jetlets at its base, leading to the gradual development of plume haze. The plume rapidly developed within the first 6 hr into its well-known morphology. Light curves from all extreme ultraviolet channels exhibit a similar profile, suggesting its multithermal nature and intensity modulation over its lifespan. Moreover, the photospheric magnetic field dynamics at the plume’s base are highly correlated with its light curve in 171 Å. We calculate outflow velocities, observed prominently in the 171 Å passband and mildly in the 193 and 211 Å passbands, with median speeds lower in higher temperature bands but occasionally comparable to the respective sound speeds. When data are averaged over larger spatial scales, the plume appears isothermal along its length, with constant temperature throughout its lifetime. However, an analysis of the differential emission measure at full resolution reveals the presence of higher-temperature plasma, indicating internal temperature structures within the plume. These results provide new insights into the formation, dynamics, and thermal properties of coronal plumes, placing tighter constraints on models to understand their thermodynamic evolution and potential role in the solar wind.

总结: 
研究了AT 2022cmc这一近期发现的潮汐撕裂事件，发现其具有明亮的喷流， beg在X射线和射电观测中表现出快速下降的和长时间持续的辐射。通过提出一个涉及具有不同洛伦兹因子的相对论性喷流的多区域模型，系统地研究了快速和慢速喷流在外部密度分布中的演变，考虑了与时间相关的质量回落时间前后的连续能量注入率。研究了快速和慢速喷流正、反冲击区域的时变多波段辐射的自洽性。结果表明能量注入率可以显著影响喷流演变，并随后影响光变曲线。 X射线光谱和光变曲线可以通过更快喷流的反冲击区域的电子同步辐射来描述，其中延迟时间X射线的上限可以解释为喷流的突变。同时，射电观测可以解释为来自更慢喷流的正冲击区域的同步辐射。还讨论了通过当前和未来观测来测试模型的前景。 <div>
AT 2022cmc is a recently documented tidal disruption event that exhibits a luminous jet, accompanied by fast-declining X-ray and long-lasting radio and millimeter emission. Motivated by the distinct spectral and temporal signatures between the X-ray and radio observations, we propose a multizone model involving relativistic jets with different Lorentz factors. We systematically study the evolution of faster and slower jets in an external density profile, considering the continuous energy injection rate associated with time-dependent accretion rates before and after the mass fallback time. We investigate time-dependent multiwavelength emission from both the forward shock (FS) and reverse shock (RS) regions of the fast and slow jets, in a self-consistent manner. Our analysis demonstrates that the energy injection rate can significantly impact the jet evolution and subsequently influence the lightcurves. We find that the X-ray spectra and lightcurves could be described by electron synchrotron emission from the RS of the faster jet, in which the late-time X-ray upper limits, extending to 400 days after the disruption, could be interpreted as a jet break. Meanwhile, the radio observations can be interpreted as a result of synchrotron emission from the FS region of the slower jet. We also discuss prospects for testing the model with current and future observations.

In the emerging era of big data astrophysics, large-scale extragalactic surveys will soon provide high-quality imaging for billions of celestial objects to answer major questions in astrophysics such as the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Precision cosmology with surveys requires accurate photometric redshift (photo-z) estimation with well-constrained uncertainties as inputs for weak lensing models to measure cosmological parameters. Machine learning methods have shown promise in optimizing the information gained from galaxy images in photo-z estimation; however, many of these methods are limited in their ability to estimate accurate uncertainties. In this work, we present one of the first applications of Bayesian convolutional neural networks (BCNNs) for photo-z estimation and uncertainties. In addition, we use conformal mapping to calibrate the photo-z uncertainties to achieve good statistical coverage. We use the public GalaxiesML data set of ∼300k galaxies from the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey containing five-band photometric images and known spectroscopic redshifts from 0 < z < 4. We find that the performance is much improved when using images compared to photometry, with the BCNN achieving 0.098 rms error, a standard outlier rate of 3.9%, a 3σ outlier rate of 4.5%, and a bias of 0.0007. The performance drops significantly beyond z > 1.5 due to the relative lack of training data beyond those redshifts. This investigation demonstrates the power of using images directly and we advocate that future photo-z analysis of large-scale surveys include galaxy images.

<div> J1543−0757, 双超大质量黑洞, Very Long Baseline Array, European VLBI Network, 广义相对论<br />
<br />
J1543−0757是一个具有两个紧密排列的超大质量黑洞系统的星系。这一发现基于对其进行的多频观测，并揭示了星系中两个紧凑的、变化的、平坦光谱、活跃的核。这些观测还提供了关于所有成分的谱指数和 proper motion 的约束。这两个核的平坦光谱强烈支持它们与两个独立的、正在吸积的超大质量黑洞有关联。两个核似乎固定不动，而从较弱的核发出的喷流似乎移动并终止在明亮的热点上。这一发现对可能成为引力辐射源的紧密双黑洞的数量有着重要的意义。<br /><br />总结: J1543−0757是一个双超大质量黑洞系统，通过多频观测发现了两个活跃的核，并提供了有关它们平坦光谱和 proper motion 的约束。这对于我们了解黑洞系统的数量和引力辐射源是具有重要意义的。 <div>
We report on the discovery of a dual supermassive black hole system in the radio galaxy J1543−0757, with a projected separation between the two black holes of ∼46 mas. The result is based on recent multifrequency observations using the Very Long Baseline Array and European VLBI Network, which reveal two compact, variable, flat-spectrum, active nuclei within the elliptical host galaxy of J1543−0757. Multiepoch observations from the Very Long Baseline Array also provide constraints on the spectral index and proper motions of all components. The flat spectra of both N and S at both frequencies strongly support the hypothesis that these radio components are associated with two separate, accreting supermassive black holes. The two nuclei appear stationary, while the jets emanating from the weaker of the two nuclei appear to move out and terminate in bright hotspots. The discovery of this system has implications for the number of close dual black holes that might be sources of gravitational radiation.

<title>Mapping the Longitudinal Magnetic Field in the Atmosphere of an Active Region Plage from the Inversion of the Near-ultraviolet CLASP2.1 Spectropolarimetric Data</title>

We apply the HanleRT Tenerife Inversion Code to the spectropolarimetric observations obtained by the Chromospheric Layer Spectropolarimeter. This suborbital space experiment measured the variation with wavelength of the four Stokes parameters in the near-ultraviolet spectral region of the Mg ii h and k lines over a solar disk area containing part of an active region plage and the edge of a sunspot penumbra. We infer the stratification of the temperature, the electron density, the line-of-sight velocity, the microturbulent velocity, and the longitudinal component of the magnetic field from the observed intensity and circular polarization profiles. The inferred model atmosphere shows larger temperature and electron density in the plage and the superpenumbra regions than in the quiet regions. The shape of the plage region in terms of its brightness is similar to the pattern of the inferred longitudinal component of the magnetic field in the chromosphere, as well as to that of the overlying moss observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly in the 171 Å band, which suggests a similar magnetic origin for the heating in both the plage and the moss region. Moreover, this heating is particularly significant in the regions with larger inferred magnetic flux. In contrast, in the superpenumbra, the regions with larger electron density and temperature are usually found in between these regions with larger magnetic flux, suggesting that the details of the heating mechanism in the chromosphere of the superpenumbra may be different from those in the plage, but with the magnetic field still playing a key role.

<title>Prior-informed Active Galactic Nucleus Host Spectral Decomposition Using PyQSOFit</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We introduce an improved method for decomposing the emission of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their host galaxies using templates from principal component analysis (PCA). This approach integrates prior information from PCA with a penalized pixel fitting mechanism that improves the precision and effectiveness of the decomposition process. Specifically, we have reduced the degeneracy and overfitting in AGN host decomposition, particularly for those with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), where traditional methods tend to fail. By applying our method to 76,565 Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 16 quasars with z < 0.8, we achieve a success rate of ≈94%, thus establishing the largest host-decomposed spectral catalog of quasars to date. Our fitting results consider the impact of the host galaxy on the overestimation of the AGN luminosity and black hole mass (MBH). Furthermore, we obtained stellar velocity dispersion (σ⋆) measurements for 4137 quasars. The slope of the MBH−σ⋆ relation in this subsample is generally consistent with previous quasar studies beyond the local Universe. Our method provides a robust and efficient approach to disentangle the AGN and host galaxy components across a wide range of SNRs and redshifts.

<title>The Wanderer: Charting WASP-77A b’s Formation and Migration Using a System-wide Inventory of Carbon and Oxygen Abundances</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The elemental and isotopic abundances of volatiles like carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen may trace a planet’s formation location relative to H2O, CO2, CO, NH3, and N2 “snowlines,” or the distance from the star at which these volatile elements sublimate. By comparing the C/O and 12C/13C ratios measured in giant exoplanet atmospheres to complementary measurements of their host stars, we can determine whether the planet inherited stellar abundances from formation inside the volatile snowlines, or nonstellar C/O and 13C enrichment characteristic of formation beyond the snowlines. To date, there are still only a handful of exoplanet systems where we can make a direct comparison of elemental and isotopic CNO abundances between an exoplanet and its host star. Here, we present a 12C/13C abundance analysis for host star WASP-77A (whose hot Jupiter’s 12C/13C abundance was recently measured). We use MARCS stellar atmosphere models and the radiative transfer code TurboSpectrum to generate synthetic stellar spectra for isotopic abundance calculations. We find a 12C/13C ratio of 51 ± 6 for WASP-77A, which is subsolar (∼91) but may still indicate 13C enrichment in its companion planet WASP-77A b (12C/13C = 26 ± 16, previously reported). Together with the inventory of carbon and oxygen abundances in both the host and companion planet, these chemical constraints point to WASP-77A b’s formation beyond the H2O and CO2 snowlines and provide chemical evidence for the planet’s migration to its current location ∼0.024 au from its host star.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of SiO, SiS, H2O, NaCl, and SO line emission at ∼30–50 mas resolution. These images map the molecular outflow and disk of Orion Source I (SrcI) on ∼12–20 au scales. Our observations show that the flow of material around SrcI creates a turbulent boundary layer in the outflow from SrcI, which may dissipate angular momentum in the rotating molecular outflow into the surrounding medium. Additionally, the data suggest that the proper motion of SrcI may have a significant effect on the structure and evolution of SrcI and its molecular outflow. As the motion of SrcI funnels material between the disk and the outflow, some material may be entrained into the outflow and accrete onto the disk, creating shocks that excite the NaCl close to the disk surface.

<title>Late-time X-Ray Observations of the Jetted Tidal Disruption Event AT2022cmc: The Relativistic Jet Shuts Off</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2022cmc represents the fourth known example of a relativistic jet produced by the tidal disruption of a stray star, providing a unique probe of the formation and evolution of relativistic jets in otherwise dormant supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Here we present deep, late-time Chandra observations of AT2022cmc extending to tobs ≈ 400 days after disruption. Our observations reveal a sudden decrease in the X-ray brightness by a factor of ≳14 over a factor of ≈2.3 in time, and a deviation from the earlier power-law decline with a steepening α ≳ 3.2 (FX ∝ t−α), steeper than expected for a jet break, and pointing to the cessation of jet activity at tobs ≈ 215 days. Such a transition has been observed in two previous TDEs (Swift J1644+57 and Swift J2058+05). From the X-ray luminosity and the timescale of jet shut-off, we parameterize the mass of the SMBH in terms of unknown jet efficiency and accreted mass fraction parameters. Motivated by the disk–jet connection in active galactic nuclei, we favor black hole masses ≲105M⊙ (where the jet and disk luminosities are comparable), and disfavor larger black holes (in which extremely powerful jets are required to outshine their accretion disks). We additionally estimate a total accreted mass of ≈0.1 M⊙. Applying the same formalism to Swift J1644+57 and Swift J2058+05, we favor comparable black hole masses for these TDEs of ≲ a few × 105M⊙, and suggest that jetted TDEs may preferentially form from lower-mass black holes when compared to nonrelativistic events, owing to generally lower jet and higher disk efficiencies at higher black hole masses.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using stacked emission-line flux measurements of cool circumgalactic gas (CGM) in lower-mass galaxies (109.0 ≤ M*/M⊙ ≤ 1010.2), we measure the dependence of the emission characteristics on orientation relative to the disk plane as a function of radius and compare to what we found previously for massive (M* > 1010.4 M⊙) early-type galaxies. Although the line ratios (the lower [N ii]/Hα and [O iii]/Hβ) suggest an overall softer ionizing source than in the more massive galaxies, consistent with previous findings, we find the same ionization hardening signature (a higher [N ii]/Hα ratio in the inner polar region) along the polar direction at small radii that we found for the more massive galaxies. The line ratio in the inner polar bin is distinct from that measured for the inner planar bin with 99.99%, confidence and with >99.9% confidence we conclude that it lies outside the star formation regime. The effective hardening of the ionization of the CGM along the polar axis, at small radii, could indicate either relic effects of active galactic nucleus activity or shock ionization. In either case, this signature appears to be ubiquitous across the stellar mass range we are able to explore with our spectral stacking technique and currently available archival data.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Cosmic dawn represents a critical juncture in cosmic history when the first population of stars emerged. The astrophysical processes that govern this transformation need to be better understood. The detection of redshifted 21 cm radiation emitted from neutral hydrogen during this era offers a direct window into the thermal and ionization state of the Universe. This emission manifests as differential brightness between spin temperature and the cosmic microwave background. The SARAS experiment aims to detect the sky-averaged signal in the frequency range 40–200 MHz. SARAS’s unique design and operational strategy to float the antenna over a water body minimizes spectral features that may arise due to stratified ground beneath the antenna. However, the antenna environment can be prone to configuration changes due to variations in critical design parameters such as conductivity and antenna tilt. In this paper, we connect the variations in antenna properties to signal detection prospects. By using realistic simulations of a direction- and frequency-dependent radiation pattern of the SARAS antenna and its transfer function, we establish critical parameters and estimate bias in the detectability of different models of the global 21 cm signal. We find a correlation between the nature of chromaticity in antenna properties and the bias in the recovered spectral profiles of 21 cm signals. We also find stringent requirements for transfer function corrections, which can otherwise make detection prospects prohibitive. We finally explore a range of critical parameters that allow robust signal detection.

<div> 高质量，星形成，ALMA观测，温度，碎裂尺度
总结:
高质量星体形成通常发生在星团环境中，本文利用ALMA 1.33mm连续观测分析了30个高质量星体形成区域，利用树状图算法发现了573个核心，并发现了约5800天文单位的核心分离度。经过进一步分析，确定了约7000天文单位的特征碎裂尺度，与区域的热约恩长度相当。因此，热约恩碎裂在高质量星体形成区域中起着决定性的作用，而不需要调用湍流约恩碎裂。 <div>
Fragmentation contributes to the formation and evolution of stars. Observationally, high-mass stars are known to form multiple-star systems, preferentially in cluster environments. Theoretically, Jeans instability has been suggested to determine characteristic fragmentation scales, and thermal or turbulent motion in the parental gas clump mainly contributes to the instability. To search for such a characteristic fragmentation scale, we have analyzed Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.33 mm continuum observations toward 30 high-mass star-forming clumps taken by the Digging into the Interior of Hot Cores with ALMA survey. We have identified 573 cores using the dendrogram algorithm and measured the separation of cores by using the Minimum Spanning Tree technique. The core separation corrected by projection effects has a distribution peaked around 5800 au. In order to remove biases produced by different distances and sensitivities, we further smooth the images to a common physical scale and perform completeness tests. Our careful analysis finds a characteristic fragmentation scale of ∼7000 au, comparable to the thermal Jeans length of the clumps. We conclude that thermal Jeans fragmentation plays a dominant role in determining the clump fragmentation in high-mass star-forming regions, without the need to invoke turbulent Jeans fragmentation.

<div> 黑洞生长，早期宇宙，低亮度活动星系核，ASPIRE项目，JWST NIRCam Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy
<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用JWST NIRCam广场无缝光谱仪，在ASPIRE项目的25个领域进行了系统的搜索，发现了16个红移为z≈4-5的广谱Hα发射线源。这些源的宽线部分的全宽半最大宽度为1000到3000km/s，暗示黑洞质量在10^7到10^8M⊙之间，同时暗示存在聚集现象。研究结果为高红移下的微弱AGN群体提供了宝贵的数据库。 <div>
Low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with low-mass black holes (BHs) in the early universe are fundamental to understanding the BH growth and their coevolution with the host galaxies. Utilizing JWST NIRCam Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy, we perform a systematic search for broad-line Hα emitters (BHAEs) at z ≈ 4–5 in 25 fields of the A SPectroscopic survey of biased halos In the Reionization Era (ASPIRE) project, covering a total area of 275 arcmin2. We identify 16 BHAEs with FWHM of the broad components spanning from ∼1000 to 3000 km s−1. Assuming that the broad line widths arise as a result of Doppler broadening around BHs, the implied BH masses range from 107 to 108M⊙, with broad Hα-converted bolometric luminosities of 1044.5–1045.5 erg s−1 and Eddington ratios of 0.07–0.47. The spatially extended structure of the F200W stacked image may trace the stellar light from the host galaxies. The Hα luminosity function indicates an increasing AGN fraction toward the higher Hα luminosities. We find possible evidence for clustering of BHAEs: two sources are at the same redshift with a projected separation of 519 kpc; one BHAE appears as a composite system residing in an overdense region with three close companion Hα emitters. Three BHAEs exhibit blueshifted absorption troughs indicative of the presence of high column density gas. We find that the broad-line-selected and photometrically selected BHAE samples exhibit different distributions in the optical continuum slopes, which can be attributed to their different selection methods. The ASPIRE broad-line Hα sample provides a good database for future studies of faint AGN populations at high redshift.

<br /><br />在这项研究中，研究人员通过STARFORGE项目的辐射-尘埃-磁流体动力学模拟对恒星形成分子云进行了研究。研究发现，一旦恒星超过一定的质量阈值（约2太阳质量），它们发出的辐射将清除其周围的尘埃颗粒，形成大约100天文单位大小的尘埃抑制区。这种尘埃的清除改变了该区域的气体性质，并且导致了恒星和其周围盘的降尘对气比（ADG）质量比的质量依赖性减少。研究预测，质量较大的恒星（≳10太阳质量）的ADG比将比其云的约低一个数量级。因此，恒星、其盘和周围环境将显示出与尘埃颗粒相关的元素（如碳和氧）的显著差异。 
<br /><br />总结: 这项研究通过模拟恒星形成过程中尘埃颗粒的动力学行为，发现随着恒星质量的增加，辐射会导致恒星周围形成尘埃抑制区，改变气体性质，影响恒星和其周围环境的尘埃对气比。对于质量较大的恒星，这种影响将导致其周围环境中常见尘埃颗粒相关元素的丰度显著减少。 <div>
Stars form within dense cores composed of both gas and dust within molecular clouds. However, despite the crucial role that dust plays in the star formation process, its dynamics is frequently overlooked, with the common assumption being a constant, spatially uniform dust-to-gas ratio and grain size spectrum. In this study, we introduce a set of radiation-dust-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of star-forming molecular clouds from the STARFORGE project. These simulations expand upon the earlier radiation MHD models, which included cooling, individual star formation, and feedback. Notably, they explicitly address the dynamics of dust grains, considering radiation, drag, and Lorentz forces acting on a diverse size spectrum of live dust grains. We find that once stars exceed a certain mass threshold (∼2 M⊙), their emitted radiation can evacuate dust grains from their vicinity, giving rise to a dust-suppressed zone of size ∼100 au. This removal of dust, which interacts with gas through cooling, chemistry, drag, and radiative transfer, alters the gas properties in the region. Commencing during the early accretion stages and preceding the main-sequence phase, this process results in a mass-dependent depletion in the accreted dust-to-gas (ADG) mass ratio within both the circumstellar disk and the star. We predict that massive stars (≳10 M⊙) would exhibit ADG ratios that are approximately 1 order of magnitude lower than that of their parent clouds. Consequently, stars, their disks, and circumstellar environments would display notable deviations in the abundances of elements commonly associated with dust grains, such as carbon and oxygen.

We present a spatially resolved study of stellar populations in six galaxies with stellar masses M* ∼ 1010M☉ at z ∼ 3.7 using 14-filter James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRCam imaging from the JADES and JEMS surveys. The six galaxies are visually selected to have clumpy substructures with distinct colors over rest frame 3600−4100 Å, including a red, dominant stellar core that is close to their stellar-light centroids. With 23-filter photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope to JWST, we measure the stellar-population properties of individual structural components via spectral energy distribution fitting using Prospector. We find that the central stellar cores are ≳2 times more massive than the Toomre mass, indicating they may not form via single in situ fragmentation. The stellar cores have stellar ages of 0.4−0.7 Gyr that are similar to the timescale of clump inward migration due to dynamical friction, suggesting that they likely instead formed through the coalescence of giant stellar clumps. While they have not yet quenched, the six galaxies are below the star-forming main sequence by 0.2−0.7 dex. Within each galaxy, we find that the specific star formation rate is lower in the central stellar core, and the stellar-mass surface density of the core is already similar to quenched galaxies of the same masses and redshifts. Meanwhile, the stellar ages of the cores are either comparable to or younger than the extended, smooth parts of the galaxies. Our findings are consistent with model predictions of the gas-rich compaction scenario for the buildup of galaxies’ central regions at high redshifts. We are likely witnessing the coeval formation of dense central cores, along with the onset of galaxy-wide quenching at z > 3.

<div> 光子，γ射线，大气响应，散射，能谱畸变
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了MeV γ射线在大气中的响应特征。观察到两种组分，一种是未经散射达到探测器的光子，另一种是经过一次或多次散射后达到探测器的光子。散射组分对于所测光谱造成了显著的能量相关畸变，尤其是在观测巴龙载荷时需要重点考虑。文章通过模拟大气中γ射线传输的完整响应发现，散射组分在更低能量下变得越来越显著，在0.1 MeV时，可能会使测量通量增加约2-4倍，取决于光子指数和源的离轴角度。这对于扩散源特别重要，而对于用成像望远镜观测的点源，散射效应可能大大降低。 <div>
The atmospheric response for MeV γ rays (∼0.1–10 MeV) can be characterized in terms of two observed components. The first component is due to photons that reach the detector without scattering. The second component is due to photons that reach the detector after scattering one or more times. While the former can be determined in a straightforward manner, the latter is much more complex to quantify, as it requires tracking the transport of all source photons that are incident on Earth’s atmosphere. The scattered component can cause a significant energy-dependent distortion in the measured spectrum, which is important to account for when making balloon-borne observations. In this work, we simulate the full response for γ-ray transport in the atmosphere. We find that the scattered component becomes increasingly more significant toward lower energies, and at 0.1 MeV, it may increase the measured flux by as much as a factor of ∼2–4, depending on the photon index and off-axis angle of the source. This is particularly important for diffuse sources, whereas the effect from scattering can be significantly reduced for point sources observed with an imaging telescope.

该研究报告了一项UNCOVER调查中的一项工作，对一颗红移为3.97的巨大宁静星系进行了光谱确认。尽管存在中等尘埃衰减的证据，深度观测在Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array中发现该星系与低（<10 M⊙ yr−1 ）星形成率（SFR）一致。研究对星系进行了详细的成分分析，发现其内部区域明显偏红，在不同区域的颜色具有强烈的梯度。通过空间分辨率的质量与光度测量，并结合最佳的双组分Sérsic模型，研究人员推断出了该星系的总质量和星际物质比。研究结果表明，这颗星系早期形成了一个密集的、低星形成率的尘埃核心，这对我们对早期结构演化的理解有着重要的启示。另外，全局、整合的尘埃特性与空间梯度的不一致也彰显了在描述星系早期生长过程时，考虑径向变化的恒星种群结构的重要性。 <div>
We report the spectroscopic confirmation of a massive ( ), Hubble Space Telescope–dark (mF150W − mF444W = 3.6) quiescent galaxy at zspec = 3.97 in the UNCOVER survey. NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy and a nondetection in deep Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array imaging surprisingly reveals that the galaxy is consistent with a low (<10 M⊙ yr−1) star formation rate (SFR) despite evidence for moderate dust attenuation. The F444W image is well modeled with a two-component Sérsic fit that favors a compact, re ∼ 200 pc, n ∼ 2.9 component and a more extended, re ∼ 1.6 kpc, n ∼ 1.7 component. The galaxy exhibits strong color gradients: the inner regions are significantly redder than the outskirts. Spectral energy distribution models that reproduce both the red colors and low SFR in the center of UNCOVER 18407 require both significant (Av ∼ 1.4 mag) dust attenuation and a stellar mass-weighted age of 900 Myr, implying 50% of the stars in the core already formed by z = 7.5. Using spatially resolved annular mass-to-light measurements enabled by the galaxy’s moderate magnification ( ) to reconstruct a radial mass profile from the best-fitting two-component Sérsic model, we infer a total mass-weighted kpc and log . The early formation of a dense, low SFR, and dusty core embedded in a less attenuated stellar envelope suggests an evolutionary link between the earliest-forming massive galaxies and their elliptical descendants. Furthermore, the disparity between the global, integrated dust properties and the spatially resolved gradients highlights the importance of accounting for radially varying stellar populations when characterizing the early growth of galaxy structure.

总结: 本研究使用了流体动力学模拟研究了银河系中心的Wolf-Rayet星的恒星风，预测了超大质量黑洞Sgr A*的X射线光谱。结果表明，在Sgr A*周围形成了一个"冷"（104K）的气体盘，这与先前的网格模拟一致。我们通过产生合成光谱来比较冷盘环境的等离子体场景与没有冷盘环境的情况，并发现目前和未来的X射线任务不太可能区分这两种场景中等离子体的动力学特征。我们的模型与Chandra HETGS获得的Sgr A*光谱相匹配。最后，我们发现射电效率低的吸积流模型和流体动力学模拟的模型并没有强烈的偏好。新的X射线任务将提供更清晰的区分，但只有角秒分辨率的未来X射线任务才能在X射线领域显著推进我们对Sgr A*吸积流的理解。 <div>
Hydrodynamic simulations of the stellar winds from Wolf–Rayet stars within the Galactic center can provide predictions for the X-ray spectrum of the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. Herein, we present results from updated smooth particle hydrodynamics simulations, building on the architecture of Cuadra et al. and Russell et al., and find that a “cold” (104 K) gas disk forms around Sgr A* with a simulation runtime of 3500 yr. This result is consistent with previous grid-based simulations, demonstrating that a cold disk can form regardless of numerical method. We examine the plasma scenarios arising from an environment with and without this cold disk, by generating synthetic spectra for comparison to the quiescent Fe Kα Sgr A* spectrum from Chandra HETGS, taken through the Chandra X-ray Visionary Program. We find that current and future X-ray missions are unlikely to distinguish between the kinematic signatures in the plasma in these two scenarios. Nonetheless, the stellar wind plasma model presents a good fit to the dispersed Chandra spectra within 1.″5 of Sgr A*. We compare our results to the radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) model fit to the HETGS spectrum presented in Paper I and find that the Bayesian model evidence does not strongly favor either model. With 9″ angular resolution and high spectral resolution of the X-IFU, NewAthena will offer a clearer differentiation between the RIAF plasma model and hydrodynamic simulations, but only a future X-ray mission with arcsecond resolution will significantly advance our understanding of Sgr A*’s accretion flow in X-rays.

<div> 关键词：Sgr A*，超大质量黑洞，辐射低效率的吸积流，Chandra HETG-S谱，RIAF模型

总结:<br /><br />本研究使用辐射低效率的吸积流（RIAF）模型对Chandra HETG-S谱进行分析，并考虑了吸积流几何形状和仪器效应。结果显示，谱线特征表明等温和速度结构存在于等离子体内。拟合高分辨率光栅谱表明，存在一个与流出平衡的流入（s∼1），并且温度分布比1/r的引力潜能预期的要平缓。数据要求铁的丰度相对太阳较低（ZFe < 0.32 Z⊙，90％的置信区间），远低于在附近晚型巨星中测量的2 Z⊙金属丰度。未来的任务将提供更高的谱分辨率，但源分离仍将是一个问题。利用Chandra无与伦比的空间分辨率进行详细的银河中心X射线的研究仍然至关重要。 <div>
The extreme low-luminosity supermassive black hole Sgr A* provides a unique laboratory in which to test models of radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs). Previous fits to the quiescent Chandra ACIS-S spectrum found that a RIAF model with an equal inflow–outflow balance works well. In this work, we apply the RIAF model to the Chandra HETG-S spectrum obtained through the Chandra X-ray Visionary Program, which displays features suggestive of temperature and velocity structures within the plasma. A comprehensive forward model analysis accounting for the accretion flow geometry and HETG-S instrumental effects is required for a full interpretation of the quiescent Chandra HETG-S spectrum. We present a RIAF model that takes these effects into account. Our fits to the high-resolution grating spectrum indicate an inflow balanced by an outflow (s ∼ 1) alongside a temperature profile that appears shallower than what would be expected from a gravitational potential following 1/r. The data require that the abundance of iron relative to solar is ZFe < 0.32 Z⊙ (90% credible interval), much lower than the 2 Z⊙ metallicity measured in nearby late-type giants. While future missions like NewAthena will provide higher spectral resolution, source separation will continue to be a problem. Leveraging Chandra’s unparalleled spatial resolution, which is not expected to be surpassed for decades, remains essential for detailed investigations of the densely populated Galactic center in X-rays.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究探讨了毫秒脉冲星在球状星团中的丰度和其光度函数的参数限制能力。我们引入了一种基于边际神经比估计的新型无似然分析方法，该方法能够一致地产生良好行为的后验概率。我们发现Terzan 5球状星团可能拥有158颗MSPs，但对这一数字的不确定性仍然很大。通过对模拟的Terzan 5样本数据进行分析，我们发现通过添加球状星团的弥散射电辐射的可靠测量或将当前无线电脉冲调查的检测阈值提高至少2倍，可以显著改善后验概率。 <div>
Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are abundant in globular clusters (GCs), which offer favorable environments for their creation. While the advent of recent, powerful facilities led to a rapid increase in MSP discoveries in GCs through pulsation searches, detection biases persist. In this work, we investigate the ability of current and future detections in GCs to constrain the parameters of the MSP population in GCs through a careful study of their luminosity function. Parameters of interest are the number of MSPs hosted by a GC, as well as the mean and the width of their luminosity function, which are typically affected by large uncertainties. While, as we show, likelihood-based studies can lead to ill-behaved posteriors on the size of the MSP population, we introduce a novel, likelihood-free analysis, based on marginal neural ratio estimation, which consistently produces well-behaved posteriors. We focus on the GC Terzan 5 (or Ter 5), which currently counts 48 detected MSPs. We find that 158 MSPs should be hosted in this GC, but the uncertainty on this number remains large. We explore the performance of our new method on simulated Terzan 5-like data sets mimicking possible future observational outcomes. We find that significant improvement on the posteriors can be obtained by adding a reliable measurement of the diffuse radio emission of the GC to the analysis or by improving the detection threshold of current radio pulsation surveys by at least a factor of 2.

<div> 关键词: CGM, 矮星系, 模拟, 摩擦剥离, 星际介质

总结: 本研究通过模拟探究了矮星系的CGM在类似银河系环境中对摩擦剥离的敏感程度。研究发现，矮星系的CGM在数百兆年内就有超过95%的质量被摩擦剥离，即使在弱摩擦剥离轨道上，ISM的剥离也是可忽略的。另外，发现加入卫星CGM并不会有效保护其星系，因此ISM的剥离速率不受影响。这些结果表明矮星系的CGM在卫星星系中难以被探测到，并且矮星系的星形成很可能不会得到CGM的补充。 <div>
The circumgalactic medium (CGM) of star-forming dwarf galaxies plays a key role in regulating the galactic baryonic cycle. We investigate how susceptible the CGM of dwarf satellite galaxies is to ram pressure stripping in Milky Way–like environments. In a suite of hydrodynamical wind tunnel simulations, we model an intermediate-mass dwarf satellite galaxy (M* = 107.2M⊙) with a multiphase interstellar medium (ISM; MISM = 107.9M⊙) and CGM (MCGM,vir = 108.5M⊙) along two first-infall orbits to more than 500 Myr past pericenter of a Milky Way–like host. The spatial resolution is ∼79 pc in the star-forming ISM and 316−632 pc in the CGM. Our simulations show that the dwarf satellite CGM removal is fast and effective: more than 95% of the CGM mass is ram pressure stripped within a few hundred megayears, even under a weak ram pressure orbit where the ISM stripping is negligible. The conditions for CGM survival are consistent with the analytical halo gas stripping predictions in McCarthy et al. We also find that including the satellite CGM does not effectively shield its galaxy, and therefore the ISM stripping rate is unaffected. Our results imply that a dwarf galaxy CGM is unlikely to be detected in satellite galaxies; and that the star formation of gaseous dwarf satellites is likely devoid of replenishment from a CGM.

MFs作为一种强大的拓扑摘要统计工具，对提取非高斯信息具有重要作用。研究发现，利用EOR阶段的21厘米亮度温度场的MFs，可以限制再电离参数。通过模拟电波干涉阵列实验，如HERA和SKA的观测，考虑包括热噪声、合成波束和前景回避在内的实际效应。研究表明，利用SKA-Low测量的21厘米信号的MFs可以区分不同的再电离模型，而使用类似HERA的阵列进行的MF测量无法准确进行。进一步预测了利用MFs测量可以限制再电离参数的精度，使用基于前向建模的参数推断的标准Markov Chain Monte Carlo分析。发现对于SKA-Low观测，MFs提供了与功率谱（PS）分析相当的再电离参数无偏估计的精度。此外，使用MFs和PS的联合约束可以提高约30%的约束精度，相比仅使用PS。然而，如果采用强前景回避缩小EOR窗口，约束精度可能会降低。我们的分析表明，MFs作为一组摘要统计量，从21厘米EOR场中提取出与双点统计不同的互补信息，因此有很大动力将MFs纳入未来21厘米观测的数据分析中。<br /><br />总结: MFs作为拓扑摘要统计工具，在21厘米再电离观测数据分析中具有重要潜力，可以提供与功率谱分析相当的再电离参数无偏估计的精度。同时，MFs与PS的联合约束可以提高约束精度，并在21厘米观测中提取出互补信息。 <div>
The Minkowski functionals (MFs), a set of topological summary statistics, have emerged as a powerful tool for extracting non-Gaussian information. We investigate the prospect of constraining the reionization parameters using the MFs of the 21 cm brightness temperature field from the epoch of reionization (EOR). Realistic effects, including thermal noise, synthesized beam, and foreground avoidance, are applied to the mock observations from radio interferometric array experiments such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). We demonstrate that the MFs of the 21 cm signal measured with SKA-Low can be used to distinguish different reionization models, whereas the MF measurement with a HERA-like array cannot be made accurately enough. We further forecast the accuracies with which the MF measurements can place constraints on reionization parameters, using the standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis for parameter inference based on forward modeling. We find that for SKA-Low observation, MFs provide unbiased estimations of the reionization parameters with accuracies comparable to the power spectrum (PS) analysis. Furthermore, joint constraints using both MFs and PS can improve the constraint accuracies by up to 30% compared to those with the PS alone. Nevertheless, the constraint accuracies can be degraded if the EOR window is shrunk with strong foreground avoidance. Our analysis demonstrates the promise of MFs as a set of summary statistics that extract complementary information from the 21 cm EOR field to the two-point statistics, which suggests a strong motivation for incorporating the MFs into the data analysis of future 21 cm observations.

总结: 
本研究分析了2016年10月12日在L1拉格朗日点探测到的星际日冕物质喷发与高速流的相互作用。通过观测-建模相结合的方法，估计了相互作用发生/起始的星际空间区域。研究使用了多种分析方法，包括最小方差分析和Walen测试来研究可能出现在星际日冕物质喷发和高速流接触界面的重联耗散。同时，使用了逐步圆柱壳重建CME来估计日冕物质喷发的几何形状和源区位置。最后，使用了两步阻力模型来估计相互作用发生的星际空间区域。研究结果表明，星际实际观测显示出具有对称和未受扰动结构的磁障碍，并展现出典型星际日冕物质喷发的磁通量、螺旋度和膨胀速度特征。而最终的两步阻力模型结果表明，星际日冕物质喷发开始与高速流相互作用的地点接近地球（约0.81天文单位），与实际观测的推断相吻合。 <br /> <div>
We analyze the interaction between an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) detected in situ at the L1 Lagrange point on 2016 October 12 with a trailing high-speed stream (HSS). We aim to estimate the region in the interplanetary (IP) space where the interaction happened/started using a combined observational-modeling approach. We use minimum variance analysis (MVA) and the Walen test to analyze possible reconnection exhaust at the interface of ICME and HSS. We perform a graduated cylindrical shell reconstruction of the CME to estimate the geometry and source location of the CME. Finally, we use a two-step drag-based model (DBM) model to estimate the region in IP space where the interaction took place. The magnetic obstacle observed in situ shows a fairly symmetric and undisturbed structure and shows the magnetic flux, helicity, and expansion profile/speed of a typical ICME. The MVA together with the Walen test, however, confirms reconnection exhaust at the ICME–HSS boundary. Thus, in situ signatures are in favor of a scenario where the interaction is fairly recent. The trailing HSS shows a distinct velocity profile which first reaches a semi-saturated plateau with an average velocity of 500 km s−1 and then saturates at a maximum speed of 710 km s−1. We find that the HSS's interaction with the ICME is influenced only by this initial plateau. The results of the two-step DBM suggest that the ICME has started interacting with the HSS close to Earth (∼0.81 au), which compares well with the deductions from in situ signatures.

Interpretation of the ongoing efforts to simulate the atmospheres of potentially habitable terrestrial exoplanets requires that we understand the underlying dynamics and chemistry of such objects to a much greater degree than 1D or even simple 3D models enable. Here, for the tidally locked habitable-zone planet TRAPPIST-1e, we explore one effect which can shape the dynamics and chemistry of terrestrial planets: the inclusion of an Earth-like land–ocean distribution with orography. To do this we use the Earth-system model WACCM6/CESM2 to run a pair of TRAPPIST-1e models with N2–O2 atmospheres and with the substellar point fixed over either land or ocean. The presence of orography shapes atmospheric transport, and in the case of Earth-like orography, breaks the symmetry between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres which was previously found in slab ocean models. For example, peak zonal jet speeds in the Southern Hemisphere are 50%–100% faster than similar jets in the Northern Hemisphere. This also affects the meridional circulation, transporting equatorial material toward the south pole. As a result we also find significant changes in the atmospheric chemistry, including the accumulation of potentially lethal quantities of ozone at both the south pole and the surface. Future studies which investigate the effects of landmass distribution on the dynamics of exoplanetary atmospheres should pay close attention to both the dayside land fraction as well as the orography of the land. Simply modeling a flat landmass will not give a complete picture of its dynamical impact.

Intrinsic colors (ICs) of stars are essential for studies on both stellar physics and dust reddening. In this work, we developed an XGBoost model to predict ICs with the atmospheric parameters Teff, , and [M/H]. The model was trained and tested for three colors at Gaia and Two Micron All Sky Survey bands with 1,040,446 low-reddening sources. The atmospheric parameters were determined by the Gaia DR3 General Stellar Parameterizer from Photometry (GSP-phot) module and were validated by comparing with the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment and Large Sky Area Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope. We further confirmed that the biases in GSP-phot parameters, especially for [M/H], do not present a significant impact on the IC prediction. The generalization error of the model estimated by the test set is 0.014 mag for , 0.050 mag for , and 0.040 mag for . The model was applied to a sample containing 5,714,528 reddened stars with stellar parameters from R. Andrae et al. to calculate ICs and reddenings. The high consistency in the comparison of E(J − KS) between our results and literature values further validates the accuracy of the XGBoost model. The variation of E(GBP − KS)/E(GBP − GRP), a representation of the extinction law, with Galactic longitude is found on large scales. This work preliminarily presents the feasibility and accuracy of the machine learning approach for IC and dust reddening calculation, whose products could be widely applied to spectrophotometric data. The data sets and trained model can be accessed via Zenodo, doi:10.5281/zenodo.12787594. Models for more bands will be completed in following work.

<div> NGC 4278, LINER, γ-ray source, Swift-XRT, spectral energy distribution
<br /><br />
NGC 4278是一个低光度活动星系核，通常被归类为低电离核发射线区(LINER)。最近，有报道称它与首个大型高海拔空气淋浴观测站(LHAASO)源目录中的一个很高能的γ射线源1LHAASO J1219+2915相关。然而，通过分析费米伽马射线空间望远镜(LAT)的数据，没有检测到相关联的对应物。通过分析Swift-XRT的X射线观测数据，我们发现NGC 4278在MJD 59546时处于高通量状态，X射线通量比大约11.7年前的Chandra观测结果高出一个数量级。有趣的是，这个Swift-XRT观测是在γ射线源1LHAASO J1219+2915的活跃阶段进行的。我们提出，NGC 4278的高能γ射线的检测可能归因于其中心活动核的存在。为了再现NGC 4278的光谱能量分布(SED)，我们采用了一个单区域的轻子模型，通常用于拟合BL Lac的宽频谱SED，并发现所需的磁场强度比典型TeV BL Lac要小。此外，与典型TeV BL Lac相比，NGC 4278在无线电和TeV波段表现出显著较低的亮度。在无线电亮度与艾丁顿比平面上，NGC 4278显示出与Seyfert星系和LINERs更相似，而不是BL Lac，然而，它仍然大致跟随BL Lac在较低亮度方向的延伸。 
<br /><br />总结: 
1. NGC 4278被归类为低光度活动星系核(LINER)；
2. 与γ射线源1LHAASO J1219+2915相关，但费米望远镜未检测到对应物；
3. Swift-XRT观测显示NGC 4278处于高通量状态；
4. 提出NGC 4278的高能γ射线检测可能与活动核有关；
5. 采用轻子模型再现NGC 4278的光谱能量分布，磁场强度较小。 <div>
NGC 4278, a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus, is generally classified as a low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER). Recently, it has been reported to be associated with a very high energy γ-ray source 1LHAASO J1219+2915 in the first Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory source catalog. However, no associated counterpart has been detected by analyzing the data collected by the Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. By analyzing its X-ray observation data from Swift-XRT, we find that NGC 4278 is in a high-flux state on MJD 59546, with the X-ray flux more than one order of magnitude higher than that observed ∼11.7 yr earlier by Chandra. Interestingly, this Swift-XRT observation was conducted during the active phase of the γ-ray source 1LHAASO J1219+2915. We propose that the detection of very high energy γ-rays from NGC 4278 may be attributed to the presence of an active nucleus in its center. To reproduce the spectral energy distribution (SED) of NGC 4278, we employ a one-zone leptonic model, typically used for fitting broadband SEDs of BL Lacs, and find that a smaller magnetic field strength is required than that of typical TeV BL Lacs. Furthermore, NGC 4278 exhibits significantly lower luminosity in both radio and TeV bands when compared with typical TeV BL Lacs. In the radio luminosity versus Eddington ratio plane, NGC 4278 shows greater similarity to Seyfert galaxies and LINERs than to BL Lacs; however, it still roughly follows the extension toward lower luminosity seen in BL Lacs.

这篇文章讨论了短暂持续的伽玛射线暴GRB 201006A产生的一次相干射电闪焰，研究认为射电闪焰可能源自超质量磁星坍缩成黑洞的过程，该磁星的表面磁场和初始自转周期落在合理范围内。作者还观察到了不符合预期的光学数据，认为这与GRB 201006A相关的铀新星辐射未被探测到。总体来说，文章认为GRB 201006A的射电闪焰、光谱能量关联和光学观测数据支持了紧凑星的合并模型。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
Recently, the detection of a coherent radio flash associated with short-duration GRB 201006A, occurring 76.6 minutes after the burst, has attracted great attention. However, the physical origin of the coherent radio flash remains under debate. By reanalyzing its data observed by Fermi and Swift, we find that an early radio afterglow as the physical origin of the radio flash can be ruled out, but the coherent radio emission seems to be consistent with the hypothesis of a supramassive magnetar as the central engine collapsing into a black hole. Within this scenario, the derived magnetar surface magnetic field (Bp) and the initial spin period (P0) fall into a reasonable range but require a preferably low value of ηR = 10−7 or 10−6. Moreover, the calculated low-ε value and Eγ,iso–Ep correlation of GRB 201006A also supports the progenitor which is from the merger of compact stars. We also discuss the non-detected kilonova emission associated with GRB 201006A, and then compare with its upper limits of optical observations.

总结: 本文利用TESS光度测量数据对矮新星HS 2325+8205中的倾斜盘旋转和阴性超级高峰进行了综合研究。发现了0.185671日的阴性超级高峰，并观察到这一频率和倾斜盘旋转周期3.943日以及4.135日周期的星食最小值的周期性变化。此外，还发现了星食深度和NSH振幅的双周期变化（P1 = 4.131日和P2 = 2.065日），并发现NSH振幅和星食深度随NSH频率的增加而减小，而NSH振幅与星食深度正相关。这些复杂的变化为理解倾斜盘旋转和阴性超级高峰提供了充分的证据。<br /><br /> <div>
Tilted disk precession exists in different objects. Negative superhumps (NSHs) in cataclysmic variable stars are believed to arise from the interaction between the reverse precession of a tilted disk and the streams from the secondary star. Utilizing Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite photometry, we present a comprehensive investigation into the tilted disk precession and NSHs in the dwarf nova (DN) HS 2325+8205, employing eclipse minima, eclipse depths, NSH frequencies, and NSH amplitudes and the correlation between them as the windows. We identified NSHs with a period of 0.185671(17) day in HS 2325+8205. The NSH frequency exhibits variability with a period of 3.943(9) days, akin to the tilted disk precession period validated in nova-like stars (SDSS J0812) and intermediate polars (IPs; TV Col). The O − C of the eclipse minima were similarly found to vary cyclically in a period of 4.135(5) days, characterized by a faster rise than fall. Furthermore, the NSH amplitude exhibits complex and diverse variations, which may be linked to changes in the disk radius, the mass transfer rate, and the apparent area of the hot spot. For the first time in DNe, we observe biperiodic variations in eclipse depth (P1 = 4.131(4) days and P2 = 2.065(2) days ≈ Pprec/2) resembling those seen in IPs, suggesting that variations with P2 are not attributable to an accretion curtain, as previously suspected. Moreover, NSH amplitude and eclipse depth decrease with increasing NSH frequency, while NSH amplitude correlates positively with eclipse depth. These complex variations observed across multiple observational windows provide substantial evidence for the understanding of tilted disk precession and NSHs.

<br />总结:<br />本文使用了机器学习方法来评估新数据对太阳耀斑后SEP事件的预测潜力。研究发现尽管数据量增加，预测精度仍未超过之前的基准，但模拟实际操作环境的线性支持向量机模型显示对SEP事件的预测精度略有提高。这表明需要更复杂、物理知识驱动的模型以更好地理解导致SEP事件的基本过程。 <div>
The prediction of solar energetic particle (SEP) events garners increasing interest as space missions extend beyond Earth’s protective magnetosphere. These events, which are, in most cases, products of magnetic-reconnection-driven processes during solar flares or fast coronal-mass-ejection-driven shock waves, pose significant radiation hazards to aviation, space-based electronics, and particularly space exploration. In this work, we utilize the recently developed data set that combines the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Space-weather Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager Active Region Patches and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Space-weather Michelson Doppler Imager Active Region Patches. We employ a suite of machine learning strategies, including support vector machines (SVMs) and regression models, to evaluate the predictive potential of this new data product for a forecast of post-solar flare SEP events. Our study indicates that despite the augmented volume of data, the prediction accuracy reaches 0.7 ± 0.1 (experimental setting), which aligns with but does not exceed these published benchmarks. A linear SVM model with training and testing configurations that mimic an operational setting (positive–negative imbalance) reveals a slight increase (+0.04 ± 0.05) in the accuracy of a 14 hr SEP forecast compared to previous studies. This outcome emphasizes the imperative for more sophisticated, physics-informed models to better understand the underlying processes leading to SEP events.

<div> 超轨道信号, 临近光度分析, 断断续续的超表面信号, 周期振荡, 出现幅度的变化
<br />
总结:<br />
这篇文章报道了对EX Dra的光度研究发现。数据显示了20次完整的爆发，表现出几个有趣且罕见的特征。光度曲线展现出一个明显的超轨道信号，周期约为4.39天，以及一个负的超脉冲，周期约为4.805小时，表明了凝聚盘的倾斜和进动。此外，超轨道周期的时变特性表明了进动周期的波动。在平静期的掩星光度极小值O-C分析显示了一个周期为3.9天的振荡，略短于超轨道周期。我们认为这不太可能是轨道周期的突然改变，而更可能受到了凝聚盘的倾斜和进动的影响。值得注意的是，我们发现了从每隔26天出现一次幅度为3.5等的爆发行为，转变为幅度大约为2.5等、周期大约为12天的行为，这种行为持续了14年才恢复。此外，在非遮蔽相位的平台上提取出了在37至40分钟之间的准周期振荡。 <div>
We present a photometric study of EX Dra, a dwarf nova that has been extensively observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. The data reveal the occurrence of 20 complete outbursts, exhibiting several intriguing and rare characteristics. The light curves exhibit a distinct superorbital signal with a period of approximately Psor ∼ 4.39(7) days, along with a negative superhump showing an approximate period of Pnsh ∼ 4.805(1) hr, indicating that the accretion disk is tilted and undergoing precession with the period of Psor. In addition, the time-varying nature of Psor suggests that the precession period is fluctuating.The eclipsing light minima O – C analysis during quiescence shows an oscillation with period of 3.9(5) days, which is a little shorter than the superorbital period. We contend that this is unlikely to be a sudden alteration of the orbital period, but rather, it is influenced by the tilt and precession of the accretion disk. Notably, we found an amplitude shift in the outburst behavior from 3.5 mag with a periodicity of about 26 days to an amplitude of around 2.5 mag with a periodicity of about 12 days, which persisted for 14 yr before reverting. Furthermore, we have extracted quasiperiodic oscillations in the plateau at the noneclipsed phases, characterized by periods ranging between 37 and 40 minutes.

本研究模拟了乙烯醇在非晶固态水表面上经过羟基加成和氢原子抽取反应两步合成(Z)-1,2-乙二醇的过程。我们考虑了1,1-和1,2-羟基加成到乙烯醇上的所有可能反应，然后是由产生的自由基进行的氢原子的抽取或加成反应。这些反应的结合能够解释(Z)-1,2-乙二醇的形成，前提是羟基的超热扩散。我们还得出结论，所提出的形成路径并不具有选择性，也会产生其他抽取和加成产物。我们的发现的关键之一是反应物和中间体的吸附模式与反应的立体选择性之间的联系。<br /><br />总结: 本研究通过模拟在非晶固态水表面上的乙烯醇的合成过程，阐明了(Z)-1,2-乙二醇的形成路径，但也指出该路径不具有选择性，同时得出了吸附模式与反应的立体选择性之间的重要联系。 <div>
In recent years, the continued detection of complex organic molecules of prebiotic interest has refueled the interest in a panspermic origin of life. The prebiotic molecule glyceraldehyde is proposed to be formed from (Z)-1,2-ethenediol, a molecule recently detected toward the G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud at the galactic center. In this work, we computationally simulate the formation of (Z)-1,2-ethenediol from vinyl alcohol on the surface of amorphous solid water in a two-step synthesis involving an OH addition and an H abstraction reaction. In total, we considered all reaction possibilities of the 1,1- and 1,2-OH addition to vinyl alcohol followed by H abstraction or H addition reactions on the resulting radicals. The combination of these reactions is capable of explaining the formation of (Z)-1,2-ethenediol provided a suprathermal diffusion of OH. We also conclude that our proposed formation pathway is not selective and also yields other abstraction and addition products. Key in our findings is the connection between the adsorption modes of the reactants and intermediates and the stereoselectivity of the reactions.

在本研究中，研究人员构建了一个半解析模型，估算了再电离对超大质量黑洞生长的影响。他们发现，在质量为1012、1011、1010 M⊙的暗物质暗云内，早期的再电离可以使超大质量黑洞的质量在z = 6时减少50%至90%。此外，他们的研究还表明，再电离的影响程度取决于Eddington accretion rate是否可以超过，如果可以，那么超大质量黑洞的质量主要在早期再电离阶段(z≳10)被抑制，否则则在整个红移范围内受抑制。最后，研究发现，全球平均再电离可能会使1011 M⊙以下的暗物质暗云内的超大质量黑洞质量减少至少两倍。未来JWST发现的超大质量黑洞普查结果可能可以验证更质量的超大质量黑洞更可能存在于后期再电离的宇宙体积中的基本预测。
<br /><br />总结: <div>
The supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that power active galactic nuclei found at z ≥ 6 were formed during the Epoch of Reionization. Because reionization is an inhomogeneous process, the physical properties of SMBH host-galaxy environments will vary spatially during reionization. We construct a semi-analytic model to estimate the impact of reionization on SMBH growth. Using a series of merger trees, reionization models, and black hole (BH) growth models, we find that early reionization can reduce a SMBH’s mass by up to [50, 70, 90]% within dark matter halos of mass [1012, 1011, 1010] M⊙ by z = 6. Our findings also suggest that the redshift range in which BH growth is impacted by reionization strongly depends on whether the Eddington accretion rate can be exceeded. If so, we find that BH masses are significantly suppressed principally during the early phases of reionization (z ≳ 10), while they are more readily suppressed across the full redshift range if super-Eddington growth is not allowed. We find that the global average impact of reionization may be to reduce the masses of BHs residing in ≲1011M⊙ halos by a factor of ≳2. The census of SMBHs being uncovered by the JWST may offer a means to test the basic prediction that more massive BHs reside in cosmological volumes that are reionized at later times.

<br /><br />总结:
研究利用詹姆斯·韦伯空间望远镜中红外仪器的中分辨率光谱仪观测了UGC 8782的射电活跃星系核宿主，以绘制温暖的分子和电离气体动力学。数据显示在内部2千秒差距内存在空间分辨的流出现象，低电离（由[Ar ii] 6.99 μm发射跟踪）和温暖的分子气体（由H2旋转跃迁跟踪）均可见。我们发现温暖流（198K ≤ T ≤ 1000K）在距离核心约900pc处的最大流出率为4.90 ± 2.04 M⊙ yr−1，并估计更热的气体相（T > 1000 K）的流出率高达1.22 ± 0.51 M⊙ yr−1。这些流出可以在约1百万年内清除整个核心温暖分子气体。所得分子流出动能导致与AGN光度的耦合效率为2%–5%，远高于AGN反馈在扼制恒星形成中至少预期的最低值。 <div>
We use the James Webb Space Telescope Mid-Infrared Instrument medium-resolution spectrometer observations of the radio-loud active galactic nucleus (AGN) host UGC 8782 to map the warm molecular and ionized gas kinematics. The data reveal spatially resolved outflows in the inner 2 kpc, seen in low ionization (traced by the [Ar ii] 6.99 μm emission) and in warm molecular gas (traced by the H2 rotational transitions). We find a maximum mass-outflow rate of 4.90 ± 2.04 M⊙ yr−1 at ∼900 pc from the nucleus for the warm outflow (198 K ≤ T ≤ 1000 K) and estimate an outflow rate of up to 1.22 ± 0.51 M⊙ yr−1 for the hotter gas phase (T > 1000 K). These outflows can clear the entire nuclear reservoir of warm molecular gas in about 1 Myr. The derived kinetic power of the molecular outflows leads to coupling efficiencies of 2%–5% of the AGN luminosity, way above the minimum expected for the AGN feedback to be effective in quenching the star formation.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了基于宇宙大尺度结构的统计分析，使用了两点摘要统计方法，如功率谱或两点相关函数。研究者重新审视了宇宙网格的几何度量，使用了最新的MillenniumTNG ΛCDM模拟套件。他们发现，暗物质分布的网格统计随着红移和聚集强度呈现明显变化，而对数值分辨率也存在显著影响。研究者还分析了星系模拟目录的网格统计，结果显示与采样密度相关性比星系选择标准更强。然而，研究结果表明，在控制采样密度时，网格统计仍然可作为互补宇宙学测试的有用工具。 <div>
The statistical analysis of cosmic large-scale structure is most often based on simple two-point summary statistics, like the power spectrum or the two-point correlation function of a sample of galaxies or other types of tracers. In contrast, topological measures of clustering are also sensitive to higher-order correlations and thus offer the prospect to access additional information that may harbor important constraining power. We here revisit one such geometric measure of the cosmic web in the form of the so-called percolation analysis, using the recent MillenniumTNG simulation suite of the ΛCDM paradigm. We analyze continuum percolation statistics both for high-resolution dark matter particle distributions and for galaxy mock catalogs from a semianalytic galaxy formation model within a periodic simulation volume of 3000 Mpc on a side. For comparison, we also investigate the percolation statistics of random particle sets and neutrino distributions with two different summed particle masses. We find that the percolation statistics of the dark matter distribution evolves strongly with redshift and thus clustering strength, yielding a progressively lower percolation threshold toward later times. However, there is a sizable residual dependence on numerical resolution, which we interpret as a residual influence of different levels of shot noise. This is corroborated by our analysis of galaxy mock catalogs, whose results depend on sampling density more strongly than on galaxy selection criteria. While this limits the discriminative power of percolation statistics, our results suggest that it still remains useful as a complementary cosmological test when controlled for sampling density.

<div> 磁星，磁场，爆发，应力张量，地壳断裂
<br />总结:
磁星爆发受到强烈磁场的驱动。最近，这一现象引起了人们的广泛关注，因为据报道与一些快速射电暴有关。了解磁星爆发可能揭示了神秘的瞬变事件的关键。地壳由于磁场演化而产生的弹性变形会在长时间尺度上累积。最终，地壳会在特定阈值之上断裂或产生塑性变形。确定临界限制是需要获得对磁应力响应中的剪应变张量的理解。在一些研究中，这个张量被一个从磁应力代数确定的近似表达式所取代。这项研究通过将其与适当计算得出的应变张量进行比较来评估该近似的有效性。通过求解由磁场驱动的弹性变形的微分方程，结果表明该近似并未准确表示应变张量的数值和空间分布。以往基于虚假标准的演化计算可能会高估应变张量的大小，并且地壳断裂会在较短时间尺度上发生。因此，有必要通过使用正确的方法重新审视演化计算。这项研究对于发展磁星地壳断裂和磁场演化的动力学非常重要。 <div>
Magnetar outbursts are powered by an intense magnetic field. The phenomenon has recently drawn significant attention because of a connection to some fast radio bursts that has been reported. Understanding magnetar outbursts may provide the key to mysterious transient events. The elastic deformation of the solid crust due to magnetic field evolution accumulates over a secular timescale. Eventually, the crust fractures or responds plastically beyond a particular threshold. Determination of the critical limit is required to obtain the shear strain tensor in response to magnetic stress. In some studies, the tensor was substituted with an approximate expression determined algebraically from the magnetic stress. This study evaluated the validity of the approximation by comparing it with the strain tensor obtained through appropriate calculations. The differential equations for the elastic deformation driven by the magnetic field were solved. The results indicated that the approximation did not represent the correct strain tensor value, in both magnitude and spatial profile. Previous evolutionary calculations based on spurious criteria are likely to overestimate the magnitude of the strain tensor, and crustal failure occurs on a shorter timescale. Therefore, revisiting evolutionary calculations using the correct approach is necessary. This study is essential for developing the dynamics of crustal fractures and the magnetic field evolution in a magnetar.

Giant eruptions (GEs) in luminous blue variables are years-to-decades-long episodes of enhanced mass loss from the outer layers of the star during which the star undergoes major changes in its physical and observed properties. We use the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics stellar evolution code to model the evolution of a 70 M⊙ star that undergoes a GE. We let the star evolve to the termination of the main sequence, and when it reaches T ≃ 19,400 K we emulate a GE by removing mass from its outer layers at a rate of 0.15 M⊙ yr−1 for 20 yr. As mass is being lost, the star contracts and releases a substantial amount of gravitational energy. The star undergoes an initial ≃3 days of expansion followed by years of contraction. During that time the star tries to reach an equilibrium state, and as a result of loss in gravitational energy, its luminosity drops about 1 order of magnitude. As the GE terminates, we let the star continue to evolve without any further mass loss and track its recovery as it regains its equilibrium by adjusting its internal structure. After ≃87 yr it reaches a state very close to the one where the GE was first initiated. We suggest that at this point another GE or a cycle of GEs may occur.

Minifilament eruptions producing small jets and microflares have mostly been studied based on coronal observations at extreme-ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths. This study presents chromospheric plasma diagnostics of a quiet-Sun minifilament of size ∼ 2″ × 5″ with a sigmoidal shape and an associated microflare observed on 2021 August 7 17:00 UT using high temporal and spatial resolution spectroscopy from the Fast Imaging Solar Spectrograph (FISS) and high-resolution magnetograms from the Near InfraRed Imaging Spectropolarimeter (NIRIS) installed on the 1.6 m Goode Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory. Using FISS Hα and Ca ii 8542 Å line spectra at the time of the minifilament activation we determined a temperature of 8600 K and a nonthermal speed of 7.9 km s−1. During the eruption, the minifilament was no longer visible in the Ca ii 8542 Å line, and only the Hα line spectra were used to find the temperature of the minifilament, which reached 1.2 × 104 K and decreased afterward. We estimated thermal energy of 3.6 × 1024 erg from the maximum temperature and kinetic energy of 2.6 × 1024 erg from the rising speed (18 km s−1) of the minifilament. From the NIRIS magnetograms we found small-scale flux emergence and cancellation coincident with the minifilament eruption, and the magnetic energy change across the conjugate footpoints reaches 7.2 × 1025 erg. Such spectroscopic diagnostics of the chromospheric minifilament complement earlier studies of minifilament eruptions made using coronal images.

However, the grain alignment physics is not fully understood. To test the radiative torque (RAT) paradigm, including RAT alignment (RAT-A) and disruption (RAT-D), we use dust polarization observed by Planck and Stratosphere Observatory for Infrared Astronomy/High-resolution Airborne Wideband Camera Plus toward two filaments, Musca and OMC-1, with contrasting physical conditions. Musca, a quiescent filament, is ideal for testing RAT-A, while OMC-1, an active star-forming region OMC-1, is most suitable for testing RAT-D. We found that polarization fraction, P, decreases with increasing polarization angle dispersion function, , and increasing column density, N(H2), consistent with RAT-A. However, P increases with increasing dust temperature, Td, but decreases when Td reaches a certain high value. We compute the polarization fraction for the ideal models with B-fields in the plane of sky based on the RAT paradigm, accounting for the depolarization effect by B-field tangling. We then compare the realistic polarization model with observations. For Musca with well-ordered B-fields, our numerical model successfully reproduces the decline of P toward the filament spine (aka polarization hole), having higher N(H2) and lower Td, indicating the loss of grain alignment efficiency due to RAT-A. For OMC-1, with stronger B-field variations and higher temperatures, our model can reproduce the observed P–Td and P−N(H2) relations only if the B-field tangling and RAT-D effect are incorporated. Our results provide more robust observational evidence for the RAT paradigm, particularly the recently discovered RAT-D.

预测伽马射线暴（GRBs）的前体是通过使用支持向量机统计的分类技术，利用标准观测和分析来实现的。这一技术提供了比先前基于射电波段持续时间的两成分高斯混合更细致的预测。通过对Fermi/伽马射线爆发监视器、Swift/爆发警报望远镜和Swift/X射线望远镜数据进行进一步的协方差测试，研究发现，仅基于暴发特性的分类提供了对最近证据的观点，即合并和塌缩星存在于“长”和“短”GRB种群中。<br /><br />总结: 本研究利用支持向量机统计的分类技术对伽马射线暴的前体进行预测，并发现了先前分类方法的局限性。通过对伽马射线暴监测器和望远镜数据的进一步分析，揭示了长短伽马射线暴种群存在合并和塌缩星的证据。 <div>
Using an established classification technique, we leverage standard observations and analyses to predict the progenitors of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). This technique, utilizing support vector machine statistics, provides a more nuanced prediction than the previous two-component Gaussian mixture in duration of the prompt gamma-ray emission. Based on further covariance testing from Fermi/Gamma Ray Burst Monitor, Swift/Burst Alert Telescope, and Swift/X-Ray Telescope data, we find that our classification based only on prompt emission properties gives perspective on the recent evidence that mergers and collapsars exist in both “long” and “short” GRB populations.

<div> 关键词: protostars, JWST, CO emission, rotational temperatures, gas masses <br />
总结: 本研究利用JWST的新观测数据，对五颗原恒星的中心区域进行了亮CO基本发射的研究。通过提取两个振动带的近红外和中红外频谱中的CO线发射图像和通量，发现13CO未被探测到，表明12CO发射为光学薄。利用H2发射线对CO通量进行校正，并构建了CO线的旋转图，估计了旋转温度和CO分子数。对v=1需要两个不同的旋转温度组分，v=2需要一个更热的组分。13CO的流失表明选择性的UV光解作用，可能解释了v=2的更高旋转温度。平均振动温度约为1000K，与最低旋转温度组分相似。根据测得的旋转和振动温度推断CO分子的总数，我们发现总气体质量范围从约低限为10^22克的最小质量原恒星到约10^26克的最大质量原恒星。我们的气体质量下限与更成熟系统中的相吻合，暗示最低旋转温度组分来自内部盘，并且也不能排除来自较大质量目标的盘风对CO发射的贡献。<br /> <div>
We investigate the bright CO fundamental emission in the central regions of five protostars in their primary mass assembly phase using new observations from JWST’s Near-Infrared Spectrograph and Mid-Infrared Instrument. CO line emission images and fluxes are extracted for a forest of ∼150 rovibrational transitions from two vibrational bands, v = 1−0 and v = 2−1. However, 13CO is undetected, indicating that 12CO emission is optically thin. We use H2 emission lines to correct fluxes for extinction and then construct rotation diagrams for the CO lines with the highest spectral resolution and sensitivity to estimate rotational temperatures and numbers of CO molecules. Two distinct rotational temperature components are required for v = 1 (∼600 to 1000 K and 2000 to ∼104 K), while one hotter component is required for v = 2 (≳3500 K). 13CO is depleted compared to the abundances found in the interstellar medium, indicating selective UV photodissociation of 13CO; therefore, UV radiative pumping may explain the higher rotational temperatures in v = 2. The average vibrational temperature is ∼1000 K for our sources and is similar to the lowest rotational temperature components. Using the measured rotational and vibrational temperatures to infer a total number of CO molecules, we find that the total gas masses range from lower limits of ∼1022 g for the lowest mass protostars to ∼1026 g for the highest mass protostars. Our gas mass lower limits are compatible with those in more evolved systems, which suggest the lowest rotational temperature component comes from the inner disk, scattered into our line of sight, but we also cannot exclude the contribution to the CO emission from disk winds for higher mass targets.

We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) observations of warm CO and H2O gas in emission toward the low-mass protostar IRAS 15398-3359, observed as part of the CORINOS program. The CO is detected via the rovibrational fundamental band and hot band near 5 μm, whereas the H2O is detected in the rovibrational bending mode at 6–8 μm. Rotational analysis indicates that the CO originates in a hot reservoir with an excitation temperature of 1598 ± 118 K, while the water is much cooler at 204 ± 7 K. Neither the CO nor the H2O line images are significantly spatially extended, constraining the emission to within ∼40 au of the protostar. The compactness and high temperature of the CO are consistent with an origin in the embedded protostellar disk, or in a compact disk wind. In contrast, the water must arise from a cooler region and requires a larger emitting area (compared to the CO) to produce the observed fluxes. The water may arise from a more extended part of the disk, or from the inner portion of the outflow cavity. Thus, the origin of the molecular emission observed with JWST remains ambiguous. Better constraints on the overall extinction, comparison with realistic disk models, and future kinematically resolved observations may all help to pinpoint the true emitting reservoirs.

<div> 高红移、双活跃星系核、X射线源、贝叶斯因子、上限

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了62个高红移（2.5 < z < 3.5）X射线源，旨在确定高红移宇宙中双活跃星系核的频率。使用BAYMAX分析工具，对每个X射线源进行分析，未发现强有力的双活跃星系核证据。通过比较测得的贝叶斯因子分布和预期的单点源样本分布，未在样本中发现双活跃星系核。虽然该研究利用了最大的Chandra高z X射线点源目录，但结果受到源于高斯时空分辨率和探测源的典型计数率的限制。该研究得出在2.5 < z < 3.5范围内X射线双活跃星系核比例的上限为4.8%。未来需要更大范围、更暗的通量的X射线测量来大幅扩展这些结果，而AXIS任务概念有望在这方面发挥潜在作用。 <div>
We present an analysis searching for dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) among 62 high-redshift (2.5 < z < 3.5) X-ray sources selected from the X-UDS, AEGIS-XD, CDF-S, and COSMOS-Legacy Chandra surveys. We aim to quantify the frequency of dual AGN in the high-redshift Universe, which holds implications for black hole merger timescales and low-frequency gravitational wave detection rates. We analyze each X-ray source using BAYMAX, an analysis tool that calculates the Bayes factor for whether a given archival Chandra AGN is more likely a single or dual point source. We find no strong evidence for dual AGN in any individual source in our sample. We increase our sensitivity to search for dual AGN across the sample by comparing our measured distribution of Bayes factors to that expected from a sample composed entirely of single point sources and find no evidence for dual AGN in the sample distribution. Although our analysis utilizes one of the largest Chandra catalogs of high-z X-ray point sources available to study, the findings remain limited by the modest number of sources observed at the highest spatial resolution with Chandra and the typical count rates of the detected sources. Our nondetection allows us to place an upper limit on the X-ray dual AGN fraction at 2.5 < z < 3.5 of 4.8% at the 95% confidence level. Expanding substantially on these results at X-ray wavelengths will require future surveys spanning larger sky areas and extending to fainter fluxes than has been possible with Chandra. We illustrate the potential of the AXIS mission concept in this regard.

G型食双星对KM UMa的首次详细光度测定和光谱分析表明，该系统是一个短周期的独立食双星。根据光谱观测数据，确定了质量比q=0.45（±0.04）。利用TESS的光变曲线和其他调查数据，以及多波段观测，发现了正负的O'Connell效应，并且这些效应在过去20年中逐渐交替出现，这可以通过主星表面的黑斑来解释。此外，在SuperWASP数据中还检测到了一个超大耀斑事件，进一步表明KM UMa是一个非常活跃的系统。通过分析数百个中分辨率谱线和一个低分辨率谱线，发现Hα线的当量宽度变化，表明存在一个5.21（±0.67）年的磁活动周期。利用O-C方法分析了轨道周期的变化，检测到了一个长期减小的趋势以及一个周期性变化。周期性变化的振幅为0.01124（±0.00004）天，周期为33.66（±0.0012）年，超过了5.21年的活动周期，这更可能是由第三体的光行时效应造成的。同时，基于Gaia的星表观测数据，还发现了一个视星等伴星，表明KM UMa实际上处于一个2+1+1的等级四重星系统中。<br /><br />总结: 本文首次对G型食双星KM UMa进行了详细的光度和光谱分析，确定了其短周期性质，发现了O'Connell效应和超大耀斑事件，并且发现了5.21年的磁活动周期和更长周期的轨道周期变化，最后确认了KM UMa实际上是一个包含两个视伴星的等级四重星系统。 <div>
The first detailed photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the G-type eclipsing binary KM UMa is presented, which indicates that the system is a short-period detached eclipsing binary. The radial velocity curves were calculated using the cross-correlation function method based on Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and our observations, which determined the mass ratio as q = 0.45 (±0.04). Based on the light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, other survey data, and our multiband observations, the positive and negative O’Connell effects have been detected evolving gradually and alternately over the last 20 yr, which can be explained by the presence of spots on the primary component. A superflare event was detected in the SuperWASP data on 2007 February 28, further indicating that KM UMa is a very active system. We calculated its energy to be 5 × 1034 erg by assuming it occurred on the primary star. Utilizing hundreds of medium-resolution spectra and one low-resolution spectrum, the equivalent width variations of the Hα line were calculated, indicating the presence of a 5.21 (±0.67) yr magnetic activity cycle. The orbital period variations were analyzed using the O–C method, detecting a long-term decrease superimposed with a periodic variation. The amplitude of the cyclic variation is 0.01124 (±0.00004) day, with a period of 33.66 (±0.0012) yr, which exceeds the 5.21 yr activity cycle, suggesting that this is more likely attributable to the light travel time effect of a third body. Simultaneously, a visual companion has been detected based on the Gaia astrometric data, indicating that KM UMa is actually in a 2+1+1 hierarchical quadruple system.

Over the last decade, studies of large samples of binary systems have identified chemical anomalies and shown that they might be attributed to planet formation or planet engulfment. However, both scenarios have primarily been tested in pairs without known exoplanets. In this work, we explore these scenarios in the newly detected planet-hosting wide binary TOI-1173 A/B (projected separation ∼11,400 au), using high-resolution MAROON-X and ARCES spectra. We determined photospheric stellar parameters both by fitting stellar models and via the spectroscopic equilibrium approach. Both analyses agree and suggest that they are cool main-sequence stars located in the thin disk. A line-by-line differential analysis between the components (B−A) displays an abundance pattern in the condensation temperature plane, where the planet-hosting star TOI-1173 A is enhanced in refractory elements such as iron by more than 0.05 dex. This suggests the engulfment of ∼18 M⊕ of rocky material in star A. Our hypothesis is supported by the dynamics of the system (detailed in our companion paper), which suggest that the super-Neptune TOI-1173 A b might have been delivered to its current short period (∼7 days) through circularization and von Zeipel–Lidov–Kozai mechanisms, thereby triggering the engulfment of inner rocky exoplanets.

总结: <br />
本文研究了利用X射线观测提供重要见解的太阳耀斑中非热电子的加速和传播。研究发现，在耀斑条件下，传统的冷靶模型无法很好地描述低能截断，因此引入了温靶模型来更好地描述能谱。另外，研究还发现卡帕分布作为电子注入的更合适表示形式，并且在两次M级耀斑的分析中得到了较好的拟合结果。最后，研究还表明使用卡帕分布能够提供有关电子加速过程的宝贵信息，包括总电子数密度和平均能量。 <div>
X-ray observations provide important and valuable insights into the acceleration and propagation of nonthermal electrons during solar flares. Improved X-ray spectral analysis requires a deeper understanding of the dynamics of energetic electrons. Previous studies have demonstrated that the dynamics of accelerated electrons with a few thermal speeds are more complex than those with significantly higher speeds. To better describe the energetic electrons after injection, a model considering energy diffusion and thermalization effects in flare conditions (the warm-target model) has recently been developed for spectral analysis of hard X-rays. This model has demonstrated how the low-energy cutoff, which can hardly be constrained in cold-target modeling, can be determined. However, the power-law form may not be the most suitable representation of injected electrons. The kappa distribution, which is proposed as a physical consequence of electron acceleration, has been applied successfully in RHESSI spectral analysis. In this study, we employ the kappa-form injected electrons in the warm-target model to analyze two M-class flares, observed by RHESSI and the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays, respectively. The best-fit results show that the kappa-form energetic electron spectrum generates lower nonthermal energy than the power-law form when producing a similar photon spectrum in the fit range. We also demonstrated that the fit parameters associated with the kappa-form electron spectrum can be well determined with small uncertainty. Further, the kappa distribution, which covers the entire electron energy range, enables the determination of key electron properties such as total electron number density and average energy at the flare site, providing valuable information on electron acceleration processes.

We present results from our deep far-ultraviolet (FUV) survey using AstroSat/UVIT of a filamentary structure at z ∼0.072. A total of four filaments comprising 58 galaxies were probed in our study. We detect 18 filament galaxies in our FUV observation. All filament galaxies are further classified based on their photometric color, nuclear activity, and morphology. The filaments contain galaxies with mixed stellar population types and structures. We do not detect galaxies in our UVIT survey up to a distance of 0.4 Mpc h−1 from the filament axis, implying a lack of recent star formation in the inner region of filaments. The FUV star formation rate (SFR) for star-forming galaxies agrees well with the SFR144MHz calculated using Low-Frequency Array radio-continuum observations. We witness an increase in the FUV specific-SFR (sSFR) of filament galaxies with increasing distance from the filament spine (Dfil). The intermediate-to-high stellar mass filament galaxies were more star-forming than cluster galaxies in a fixed stellar mass bin. The FUV morphology of some filament galaxies detected in the filament outskirts (Dfil ≳ 0.7 Mpc h−1) is comparable to or slightly extended than their optical counterpart. The mass assembly of galaxies examined by estimating (FUV − r) color gradients shows that more “red-cored’ galaxies reside in the outer region of the filaments. Our results prove that the likelihood of merger interaction and gas starvation increases when approaching the filament spine. We report a definitive and inhomogeneous impact of filaments on the galaxies residing inside them.

Sagittarius A*是银河系中心的超大质量黑洞，通过EHT对其进行了观测和建模。研究表明，目前的VLBI设施无法探测到Sgr A*的喷流。然而，通过下一代VLBI设施（如ngEHT和ngVLA），特别是在86和115 GHz的频率下，可以成功捕捉到Sgr A*的喷流。这些结果突出了未来十年增强VLBI能力的潜力，可以揭示Sgr A*及其与银河中心环境的关键特性。 
<br /><br />总结: Event Horizon Telescope观测并建模了银心超大质量黑洞Sagittarius A*，发现目前的VLBI设施无法探测到其喷流，但未来的ngEHT和ngVLA在86和115 GHz的频率下有望成功捕捉到喷流。这突出了未来十年增强VLBI能力的潜力。 <div>
Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) images of the horizon-scale emission around the Galactic center supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) favor accretion flow models with a jet component. However, this jet has not been conclusively detected. Using the “best-bet” models of Sgr A* from the EHT Collaboration, we assess whether this nondetection is expected for current facilities and explore the prospects of detecting a jet with very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) at four frequencies: 86, 115, 230, and 345 GHz. We produce synthetic image reconstructions for current and next-generation VLBI arrays at these frequencies that include the effects of interstellar scattering, optical depth, and time variability. We find that no existing VLBI arrays are expected to detect the jet in these best-bet models, consistent with observations to date. We show that next-generation VLBI arrays at 86 and 115 GHz—in particular, the EHT after upgrades through the ngEHT program and the ngVLA—successfully capture the jet in our tests due to improvements in instrument sensitivity and (u, v) coverage at spatial scales critical to jet detection. These results highlight the potential of enhanced VLBI capabilities in the coming decade to reveal the crucial properties of Sgr A* and its interaction with the Galactic center environment.

总结:<br />
本文介绍了一种扩展传统速率方程方法的框架，用于将不同的结合位点纳入气冰天体化学模型中。作者提出了一种估算吸附物种占据各种位点的概率密度函数的简单方法，通过加权的热解吸和跳跃速率，将结合能分布的影响纳入速率方程方法中。这种方法准确而高效，可以应用于包含数百种冰物种的大型气冰化学网络。文章还首次定量讨论了结合能分布对星际冰组成的影响。 <div>
One of the most serious limitations of current astrochemical models with the rate equation (RE) approach is that only a single type of binding site is considered in grain surface chemistry, although laboratory and quantum chemical studies have found that surfaces contain various binding sites with different potential energy depths. When various sites exist, adsorbed species can be trapped in deep potential sites, increasing the resident time on the surface. On the other hand, adsorbed species can be populated in shallow sites, activating thermal hopping and thus two-body reactions even at low temperatures, where the thermal hopping from deeper sites is not activated. Such behavior cannot be described by the conventional RE approach. In this work, I present a framework for incorporating various binding sites (i.e., binding energy distribution) in gas-ice astrochemical models as an extension of the conventional RE approach. I propose a simple method to estimate the probability density function (pdf) for the occupation of various sites by adsorbed species, assuming a quasi-steady state. By using thermal desorption and hopping rates weighted by the pdfs, the effect of binding energy distribution is incorporated into the RE approach without increasing the number of ordinary differential equations to be solved. This method is found to be accurate and computationally efficient, and enables us to consider binding energy distribution even for a large gas-ice chemical network which contains hundreds of icy species. The impact of the binding energy distribution on interstellar ice composition is discussed quantitatively for the first time.

In the upcoming gravitational-wave (GW) observing runs, identifying host galaxies is crucial as it provides essential redshift information and enables the use of GW events as standard sirens. However, pinpointing host galaxies remains challenging due to the large localization uncertainties and the rapidly fading nature of their optical counterparts. Analyzing the host galaxies of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) offers an alternative approach to deepen our understanding of the environments where binary neutron stars (BNS) primarily merge. This study compiles archival photometric data for the host galaxies of 76 sGRBs and four hybrid GRBs that are long GRBs accompanied by kilonova-like signals. We use this data to evaluate their physical properties through spectral energy distribution fitting. To assess the characteristics of the host galaxies, we utilized a volume-limited sample (z < 0.5) from the COSMOS field as a control group. Contrary to expectations that the BNS merger rate is proportional to host stellar mass, the short and hybrid GRB population appears less massive than the mass-weighted distribution of the control sample. Instead, we propose a formulation for the expected BNS merger rate from a galaxy as + , which optimally explains the deviation between the stellar mass distributions of the GRB host galaxies and the control sample. These insights provide a strategic framework for targeted GW follow-ups and enhance our ability to identify potential host galaxies for future GW events.

<div> 超巨星, 超巨大, 恒星, 质量流失, 观测

总结:<br /><br />研究发现超巨星如红超巨星和超超巨星可能是II型超新星的祖先,它们在演化的最后阶段会喷射大量物质. 观测表明,由于大对流细胞的活动和脉动的作用,这些恒星可能出现质量流失事件. 本研究利用干涉观测CHARA阵列对著名的黄色超巨星ρ Cas进行了研究,发现了巨大的热点和冷斑,这些可能与恒星的物质喷射有关. 此外,在K波段观测到CO发射线,揭示了一个扩展的星周包层. <div>
Massive evolved stars such as red supergiants and hypergiants are potential progenitors of Type II supernovae, and they are known for ejecting substantial amounts of matter, up to half their initial mass, during their final evolutionary phases. The rate and mechanism of this mass loss play a crucial role in determining their ultimate fate and the likelihood of their progression to supernovae. However, the exact mechanisms driving this mass ejection have long been a subject of research. Recent observations, such as the Great Dimming of Betelgeuse, have suggested that the activity of large convective cells, combined with pulsation, could be a plausible explanation for such mass-loss events. In this context, we conducted interferometric observations of the famous yellow hypergiant, ρ Cassiopeiae using the CHARA Array in H- and K-band wavelengths. ρ Cas is well known for its recurrent eruptions, characterized by periods of visual dimming (∼1.5–2 mag) followed by recovery. From our observations, we derived the diameter of the limb-darkened disk and found that this star has a radius of 1.04 ± 0.01 mas, or 564–700 R⊙. We performed image reconstructions with three different image reconstruction software packages, and they unveiled the presence of giant hot and cold spots on the stellar surface. We interpret these prominent hot spots as giant convection cells, suggesting a possible connection to mass ejections from the star’s envelope. Furthermore, we detected spectral CO emission lines in the K band (λ = 2.31–2.38 μm), and the image reconstructions in these spectral lines revealed an extended circumstellar envelope with a radius of 1.45 ± 0.10 mas.

总结: <br />这篇文章对类星体1604+159进行了多频率极化研究，发现了类星体呈现出类似Fanaroff–Riley I型结构的对称形态，具有多个叶状结构和凸起，形成一个蚕茧状形态。观测还发现了两个热点，呈现出对称的结构，热点间的流量密度比值表明存在多普勒爆发效应。极化辐射也展示出符合喷流方向的对称结构。研究还发现喷流在几处发生弯曲，其中边缘的极化强度和比例较高。文章讨论了观测结构和磁场的可能起源。<br /> <div>
We present a multifrequency polarimetric study for the quasar 1604+159. The source was observed at the L band with the American Very Long Baseline Array and the L, X, and U bands with the Very Large Array. These observations provide different resolutions from mas to arcsec, enabling us to probe the morphology and magnetic field from tens of parsec to hundreds of kiloparsec scale. We detect a symmetrical Fanaroff–Riley Class I–like structure. The source has several lobes and bulges, forming a cocoon shape. The polarization is normal to the edges of the structure with high fractional polarization up to ∼60%. Two hotspots are observed at the eastern and western sides of the source, located symmetrically relative to the core. The flux density ratio (>1.5) between the two hotspots suggests the Doppler beaming effect exists at a large scale. The polarized emission in the hotspots also shows a symmetrical structure with an oblique direction from the jet direction. In general, the jet propagates in a collimating structure with several bends. Polarization is also detected perpendicular to the local jet from ∼100 mas to ∼1″. The jet shows strong polarized intensity and high fractional polarization at the bending edges. We discuss the possible origins of the observed structure and magnetic field.

<div> 关键词: 通量-纳贝尔方程-黑洞-中微子-浓缩物质<br />
总结: <br />这篇文章研究了黑洞吸积盘风系统的中微子辐射。在模拟初期发现了电子激元数（ELN）-额外激元数（XLN）交叉现象，但随着时间推移，这种交叉现象只在赤道附近存在。文章对中微子辐射场的几何结构和演变进行了详细分析，并通过与其他发表作品的定性评估，讨论了造成差异的原因。研究发现的ELN-XLN交叉及快速味道不稳定性的几何结构和演变对中子星并合的重元素核成因具有重要意义。 <br /> <div>
We postprocess a three-dimensional, general relativistic, full transport neutrino radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulation of the black-hole-accretion disk-wind system thought to be a potential outcome of the GW170817 merger to investigate the presence of electron lepton number (ELN-XLN) crossings in the neutrino angular distribution. Neutrinos are evolved with an explicit Monte Carlo method and can interact with matter via emission, absorption, or scattering. Within the postprocessing framework, we find ubiquitous occurrence of ELN-XLN crossings at early times (∼11 ms), but this does not hold for later times in the simulation. At postmerger times of ∼60 ms and beyond, ELN-XLN crossings are only present near the equator. We provide a detailed analysis of the neutrino radiation field to investigate the origin and time evolution of these crossings. Previous reports have suggested ubiquitous flavor crossings persisting throughout the simulation lifetime, albeit for different sets of conditions for the merger remnant, the treatment of hydrodynamics, and neutrino transport. Even though we do not perform a direct comparison with other published works, we qualitatively assess the reasons for the difference with our results. The geometric structure and evolution of the ELN-XLN crossings found in our analysis, and by extension, fast flavor instabilities, have important implications for heavy element nucleosynthesis in neutron star mergers.

<div> Alfvén waves, solar wind, turbulence, dynamic alignment, Helios 2 spacecraft
<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了太阳风动力学对动态对齐的影响。研究表明太阳风的湍流受动态对齐影响，但小尺度上并无动态对齐。通过Helios 2航天器观测慢速太阳风间隔，发现只有反向Alfvén波会经历动态对齐，非Alfvén结构则不参与对齐过程。研究还发现，随着尺度缩小，反向Alfvén波的功率比逐渐减小，而非Alfvén结构的功率比在增加。这暗示着需要新的理论模型来充分解释太阳风的可压缩性、间歇性和不平衡性。 <div>
The solar wind dynamics are thought to be governed by counter-propagating Alfvén waves. Alfvén waves generate a turbulent cascade through nonlinear couplings between shearing wave packets. However, imbalances, structures, and intermittency complicate the solar wind’s magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. Simulations and theories have suggested that dynamic alignment, or the tendency for velocity and magnetic fluctuations to become more correlated as a function of scale, may dictate the turbulent cascade. Observations have hinted at dynamic alignment at large scales but remain inconclusive at small scales. To investigate the nature of dynamically aligning fluctuations in the solar wind, we examine slow wind intervals from the Helios 2 spacecraft. We develop a two-component model of solar wind turbulence consisting of Alfvénic and non-Alfvénic contributions. We assume that only counter-propagating Alfvén waves experience dynamic alignment, and the non-Alfvénic structures do not participate in the alignment process. Our model allows us to constrain the relative contribution of inward Alfvén waves and non-Alfvénic structures with respect to the amplitude of outward Alfvén waves in the slow solar wind as a function of scale under the assumption of dynamic alignment. We show that the power ratio of inward to outward Alfvén fluctuations decreases as a function of scale. At the same time, the non-Alfvénic structures to outward Alfvén fluctuations increase with decreasing scale. Increasing structures provide a possible explanation for no dynamic alignment at small scales. Our study implies the need for new theoretical models to fully account for the solar wind’s compressibility, intermittency, and imbalanced nature.

总结:<br /><br />文章介绍了Vera C. Rubin Observatory的独特性，以及它所采用的活跃光学系统来控制图像质量。研究还介绍了一种结构化方法来识别和解决调整自由度过多和由于噪音导致的退化问题。通过截断奇异值分解的新比例策略，该方法能够最大限度地分配调整度，确保实现最佳图像质量。这种方法不仅适用于Rubin Observatory，还可能对所有具有大量调整自由度的望远镜产生显著的益处。 <div>
The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is a unique facility for survey astronomy that will soon be commissioned and begin operations. Crucial to many of its scientific goals is the achievement of sustained high image quality, limited only by the seeing at the site. This will be maintained through an active optics system that controls optical element misalignments and corrects mirror figure error to minimize aberrations caused by both thermal and gravitational effects. However, the large number of adjustment degrees of freedom available on the Rubin Observatory introduces a range of degeneracies, including many that are induced by noise due to imperfect measurement of the wave-front errors. We present a structured methodology for identifying these degeneracies through an analysis of image noise level. We also present a novel scaling strategy based on truncated singular value decomposition that mitigates the degeneracy and optimally distributes the adjustment over the available degrees of freedom. Our approach ensures the attainment of optimal image quality, while avoiding excursions around the noise-induced subspace of degeneracies, marking a significant improvement over the previous techniques adopted for Rubin, which were based on an optimal integral controller. This new approach is likely to also yield significant benefits for all telescopes that incorporate large numbers of degrees of freedom of adjustment.

<div> 能谱、尖峰尺度、涡度、涡旋、星系团
<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用连续小波变换技术分析了宇宙流体速度场的湍流运动，并通过IllustrisTNG模拟数据构建了全局和环境相关的小波统计特征，如能谱和峰度，研究了湍流运动的波动和间歇性。研究发现能谱的峰值尺度定义了一个特征尺度，可视为湍流的整体尺度，而奈奎斯特波数可视为耗散尺度。有了这两个特征尺度，能谱可分为能量包含范围、惯性范围和耗散范围。小波峰度是波数k的增函数，随着k的增加而迅速变化，然后变化缓慢，表明宇宙流体随着波数k的增加变得更加间歇。在能量包含范围内，能谱在z = 2到1之间显著增加，但在z = 1到0之间几乎保持不变。环境相关的能谱和峰度与全局特征相似，而且在最低密度环境中能谱的幅度最小，在最高密度环境中最大，表明高密度环境中的宇宙流体湍动比低密度环境中更加剧烈。在惯性范围内，能谱的指数比科尔莫哥洛夫和波尔格指数更陡，表明了更有效的能量转移。 <div>
We use continuous wavelet transform techniques to construct the global and environment-dependent wavelet statistics, such as energy spectrum and kurtosis, to study the fluctuation and intermittency of the turbulent motion in the cosmic fluid velocity field with the IllustrisTNG simulation data. We find that the peak scale of the energy spectrum defines a characteristic scale, which can be regarded as the integral scale of turbulence, and the Nyquist wavenumber can be regarded as the dissipation scale. With these two characteristic scales, the energy spectrum can be divided into the energy-containing range, the inertial range, and the dissipation range of turbulence. The wavelet kurtosis is an increasing function of the wavenumber k, which first grows rapidly then slowly with k, indicating that the cosmic fluid becomes increasingly intermittent with k. In the energy-containing range, the energy spectrum increases significantly from z = 2 to 1, but remains almost unchanged from z = 1 to 0. We find that both the environment-dependent spectrum and kurtosis are similar to the global ones, and the magnitude of the spectrum is smallest in the lowest-density and largest in the highest-density environment, suggesting that the cosmic fluid is more turbulent in a high-density than in a low-density environment. In the inertial range, the energy spectrum’s exponent is steeper than both the Kolmogorov and Burgers exponents, indicating more efficient energy transfer compared to Kolmogorov or Burgers turbulence.

<div> AGN, massive stars, accretion, radiation hydrodynamic simulations, fast-diffusion regime
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了在活动星系核盘中形成或捕获的超大恒星，并通过模拟发现了它们的气体吸积过程。在“快扩散”和“慢扩散”两种不同的情况下，发现了不同的吸积速率和关键半径，并指出了在实际环境中的应用。文章强调了1D长期计算中需要注意的一些问题。 <div>
Massive stars may form in or be captured into active galactic nuclei (AGN) disks. Recent 1D studies employing stellar-evolution codes have demonstrated the potential for rapid growth of such stars through accretion up to a few hundred solar masses. We perform 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulations of moderately massive stars’ envelopes in order to determine the rate and critical radius Rcrit of their accretion process in an isotropic gas-rich environment in the absence of luminosity-driven mass loss. We find that in the “fast-diffusion” regime where characteristic radiative diffusion speed c/τ is faster than the gas sound speed cs, the accretion rate is suppressed by feedback from gravitational and radiative advection energy flux, in addition to the stellar luminosity. Alternatively, in the “slow-diffusion” regime where c/τ < cs, due to adiabatic accretion, the stellar envelope expands quickly to become hydrostatic and further net accretion occurs on thermal timescales in the absence of self-gravity. When the radiation entropy of the medium is less than that of the star, however, this hydrostatic envelope can become more massive than the star itself. Within this subregime, the self-gravity of the envelope excites runaway growth. Applying our results to realistic environments, moderately massive stars (≲100M⊙) embedded in AGN disks typically accrete in the fast-diffusion regime, leading to a reduction of steady-state accretion rate 1–2 orders of magnitudes lower than expected by previous 1D calculations and Rcrit smaller than the disk scale height, except in the opacity window at temperature T ∼ 2000 K. Accretion in slow diffusion regime occurs in regions with very high density ρ ≳ 10−9 g cm−3, and needs to be treated with caution in 1D long-term calculations.

这项研究利用TNG50模拟的数据发现，银河系的高速云可能有着多种不同的起源。通过追踪TNG50 Milky Way−like galaxy模拟中冷、密云团的来源，发现只有17%来自盘内，21%来自卫星被剥离的物质，而大多数（62%）高速云是由环银河热气体经由热不稳定性冷却形成的，并通过与旋转的环银河介质相互作用获得其异常的速度。综合来看，这些结果表明银河系的高速云在来源上具有高度的异质性，并能够为形成环银河介质的物理过程提供深入的见解，例如盘上的流出、卫星的吸积和热不稳定性。 <div>
The origin of our Galaxy’s high-velocity clouds (HVCs) remains a mystery after many decades of effort. In this paper, we use the TNG50 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project to identify cool, dense clouds that match observations of Galactic H i HVCs. We track these clouds back in time to determine their origin. For a TNG50 Milky Way−like galaxy, we find that only 17% of HVCs can be tracked directly to the disk and 21% to material stripped out of satellites. The majority of HVCs (62%) arise from warm and hot circumgalactic gas that cools through thermal instability. They then obtain their anomalous velocities through interactions with the turbulent circumgalactic medium. At TNG50 resolution, we do not see evidence for HVCs forming out of very low metallicity intergalactic material. Instead, low-metallicity HVCs are most likely associated with satellites. These results suggest that Galactic HVCs are highly heterogeneous in their origin and can provide insight into the physical processes that shape the circumgalactic medium, such as disk outflows, satellite accretion, and thermal instabilities.

利用太阳动力学观测卫星（SDO）和太阳和日球层观测卫星（SOHO）的观测，研究了1999年至2021年间30个明显的电流片，包括SDO的10个在太阳盘面上和8个在边缘，以及SOHO的12个在边缘。每个在太阳盘面上的电流片是由两组大气结构的X型配置形成的，而每个边缘的电流片都涉及耀斑 - 日冕物质抛射事件。在磁重连期间，太阳盘面上的明显电流片从一个明亮点演变为一个细长的线状结构，在重连的后期结构变得很薄。随后，电流片内的等离子体分布呈现为一串等离子体小结。对于边缘的明显电流片，其长度延伸速度快于太阳盘面上的电流片，并且也检测到了变薄的过程。尽管边缘案例的长宽比与模拟研究中撕裂模式不稳定性的发生值相当，但在这些边缘电流片中并没有明显的等离子体小结，并且密度分布局部均匀。我们认为，由于边缘案例的迅速延伸，撕裂模式的不稳定性非常快，导致形成比仪器分辨率更小的微小等离子体小结。此外，还有另一种可能情况。观测到的边缘明显电流片只是一个明亮的射线，实际的电流片只是射线的一个小片段。
<br /><br />总结: 该研究利用SDO和SOHO观测了30个明显的太阳电流片，发现在太阳盘面上和边缘的电流片形成过程和特征有所不同。在磁重连期间，电流片从明亮点演变为细长的线状结构，随后形成等离子体小结。边缘电流片的长度延伸速度更快，并且没有明显的等离子体小结。这对于太阳物理领域的研究具有重要意义。 <div>
Based on observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), we investigate 30 apparent current sheets during 1999–2021, including 10 on-disk and 8 limb ones from the SDO, as well as 12 limb ones from the SOHO. Each on-disk current sheet is formed among an X-type configuration consisting of two sets of atmospheric structures, and each limb one is involved in a flare–coronal mass ejection event. During magnetic reconnection period, the on-disk apparent current sheet evolves from a bright point to an elongated line-like structure, and the structure becomes thin in the late stage of the reconnection. Subsequently, the plasma distribution within the current sheet manifests as a plasmoid chain. For the limb apparent current sheet, the length elongation is faster than that of the on-disk one, and the thinning process is also detected. Although the aspect ratios of the limb cases are comparable to the value for the occurrence of tearing mode instability from simulation research, no obvious plasmoid chain is detected within these limb current sheets, and the density distribution is locally uniform. We suggest that due to the rapid extension of limb cases, the tearing mode instability is very fast, resulting in the formation of tiny plasmoids that are smaller than the instrument resolution. Moreover, there is another possible scenario. The observed limb apparent current sheet is just a bright ray, and the actual current sheet is only a small segment of the ray.

Detecting planet signatures in protoplanetary disks is fundamental to understanding how and where planets form. In this work, we report dust and gas observational hints of planet formation in the disk around 2MASS J16120668-301027, as part of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Large Program “AGE-PRO: ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in Protoplanetary disks.” The disk was imaged with the ALMA at Band 6 (1.3 mm) in dust continuum emission and four molecular lines: 12CO(J = 2–1), 13CO(J = 2–1), C18O(J = 2–1), and H2CO(J = 3(3,0)–2(2,0)). Resolved observations of the dust continuum emission (angular resolution of ∼150 mas, 20 au) show a ring-like structure with a peak at 0.″57 (75 au), a deep gap with a minimum at 0.″24 (31 au), an inner disk, a bridge connecting the inner disk and the outer ring, along with a spiral arm structure, and a tentative detection (to 3σ) of a compact emission at the center of the disk gap, with an estimated dust mass of ∼2.7−12.9 Lunar masses. We also detected a kinematic kink (not coincident with any dust substructure) through several 12CO channel maps (angular resolution ∼200 mas, 30 au), located at a radius of ∼0.″875 (115.6 au). After modeling the 12CO velocity rotation around the protostar, we identified a purple tentative rotating-like structure at the kink location with a geometry similar to that of the disk. We discuss potential explanations for the dust and gas substructures observed in the disk and their potential connection to signatures of planet formation.

X-ray polarization provides a new way to probe accretion geometry in black hole systems. If the accretion geometry of black holes is similar regardless of mass, we should expect the same to be true of their polarization properties. We compare the polarimetric properties of all nonblazar black holes observed with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer. We find that their polarization properties are very similar, particularly in the hard state, where the corona dominates. This tentatively supports the idea that stellar and supermassive black holes share a common coronal geometry.

总结: 
这篇文章研究了白矮星被重元素污染的问题，主要关注行星的潮汐破碎过程以及因外部引力扰动导致的污染情况。研究考虑了由白矮星、内行星和外行星组成的三体系统，内行星会周期性地部分破碎，并受到外行星的引力扰动影响，导致碎片向白矮星坠落。内行星的质量流失取决于其内部结构和行星系统的轨道配置。文章提出了对这些问题深入研究的观点。<br /><br /> <div>
About 25%–50% of white dwarfs (WDs) are found to be polluted by heavy elements. It has been argued that the pollution could be caused by the tidal disruption of an approaching planet around the WD, during which a large number of clumps would be produced and would finally fall onto the WD. The reason that the planet approaches the WD is usually believed to be due to gravitational perturbations from another distant planet or stellar companion. However, the dynamics of the perturbations and the detailed partial disruption process are still poorly understood. In this study, we present an in-depth investigation of these issues. A triple system composed of a WD, an inner orbit planet, and an outer orbit planet is considered. The inner planet would be partially disrupted periodically over its long-term evolution. Fragments generated in the process are affected by gravitational perturbations from the remnant planet, facilitating their fall toward the WD. The mass-loss rate of the inner planet depends on both its internal structure and also on the orbital configuration of the planetary system.

<div> NGC 6822, low-metallicity, dwarf galaxy, CNM, LGLBS
总结:
NGC 6822是局部星系群中一个低金属量的矮星系，通过Local Group L-band Survey（LGLBS）的高空间和光谱分辨率探测到了两个局部的原子氢中性吸收特征，这是在麦哲伦云之外的低金属量矮星系中首次明确探测到冷中性介质（CNM）。研究使用了自定义管线对高角分辨率的H i吸收进行搜索，并提取相关的H i发射。进一步的高斯分解和辐射传输分析显示了五个CNM成分，并揭示了其关键特性：平均自旋温度为32 ± 6 K，平均CNM柱密度为3.1 × 1020 cm−2，以及两个视线的CNM质量分数分别为0.33和0.12。H i吸收与星形成区域相交，而H i吸收轮廓包括了CO（2−1）发射，表明了分子气体的巧合和高分辨率H i发射的抑制。进一步分析了附近的一个视线，发现了深而窄的H i自吸收，在这里，背景的暖中性介质被中间的CNM所吸收。CNM、CO和Hα发射的关联暗示了NGC 6822中较冷、较密的H i相和星形成之间的密切联系。 <div>
Measuring the properties of the cold neutral medium (CNM) in low-metallicity galaxies provides insights into heating and cooling mechanisms in early Universe-like environments. We report detections of two localized atomic neutral hydrogen (H i) absorption features in NGC 6822, a low-metallicity (0.2 Z⊙) dwarf galaxy in the Local Group. These are the first unambiguous CNM detections in a low-metallicity dwarf galaxy outside the Magellanic Clouds. The Local Group L-band Survey (LGLBS) enabled these detections, due to its high spatial (15 pc for H i emission) and spectral (0.4 km s−1) resolution. We introduce LGLBS and describe a custom pipeline for searching for H i absorption at high angular resolution and extracting associated H i emission. A detailed Gaussian decomposition and radiative transfer analysis of the NGC 6822 detections reveals five CNM components, with key properties: a mean spin temperature of 32 ± 6 K, a mean CNM column density of 3.1 × 1020 cm−2, and CNM mass fractions of 0.33 and 0.12 for the two sightlines. Stacking nondetections does not reveal low-level signals below our median optical depth sensitivity of 0.05. One detection intercepts a star-forming region, with the H i absorption profile encompassing the CO (2−1) emission, indicating coincident molecular gas and a depression in high-resolution H i emission. We also analyze a nearby sightline with deep, narrow H i self-absorption dips, where the background warm neutral medium is attenuated by intervening CNM. The association of CNM, CO, and Hα emissions suggests a close link between the colder, denser H i phase and star formation in NGC 6822.

<div> 关键词: Gaia mission, astrometric binaries, machine learning, artificial neural network, classification

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章提出了利用Gaia任务收集的数据，通过机器学习技术来自动分类恒星是否属于测量二元系统。研究使用了人工神经网络，并利用了高精度的数据进行训练和测试。结果表明，该方法在分类恒星时具有很高的准确性和效率，是一个有前景的替代方法。 <div>
With nearly two billion stars observed and their corresponding astrometric parameters evaluated in the recent Gaia mission, the number of astrometric binary candidates has risen significantly. Due to the surplus of astrometric data, the current computational methods employed to inspect these astrometric binary candidates are both computationally expensive and cannot be executed in a reasonable time frame. In light of this, a machine learning (ML) technique to automatically classify whether a set of stars belongs to an astrometric binary pair via an artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed. Using data from Gaia Data Release 3, the ANN was trained and tested on 1.5 million highly probable true and visual binaries, considering the proper motions, parallaxes, and angular and physical separations as features. The ANN achieves high classification scores, with an accuracy of 99.3%, a precision rate of 0.988, a recall rate of 0.991, and an area under the curve of 0.999, indicating that the utilized ML technique is a highly effective method for classifying astrometric binaries. Thus, the proposed ANN is a promising alternative to the existing methods for the classification of astrometric binaries.

<br />
在Seyfert 1星系Mrk 817的XMM-Newton和NuSTAR观测中，发现了出乎意料的临时遮挡流，这在该源中以前从未见过。通过高分辨率光栅光谱中的吸收特征，确定遮挡物实际上是一种多相离子化风，具有约5200 km s−1的出流速度，并首次发现在同时期的哈勃空间望远镜光谱中观测到了与相同速度的吸收特征相同离子化的下限组分。我们观察到吸收线的形状在几小时的时间尺度上发生变化，如果归因于沿视线的横向运动，则可将可变组分放置在大约1000个Schwarzschild半径，这一估计与对遮挡物距离独立UV测量相一致，表明存在于内部宽线区域的一个吸积盘风。我们估计出流需要大约200天从盘面到我们的视线，这与整个观测过程中流的柱密度变化的时间尺度一致。
<br /><br />总结: Seyfert 1星系Mrk 817的观测发现了一种之前未见的离子化风遮挡物，其在X射线和紫外线光谱中的吸收特征表现出多相并具有变化。测量距离遮挡物的方法为对相同参数的独立测量进行了估计。 <div>
We present the results of the XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations taken as part of the ongoing, intensive multiwavelength monitoring program of the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 817 by the AGN Space Telescope and Optical Reverberation Mapping 2 (AGN STORM 2) Project. The campaign revealed an unexpected and transient obscuring outflow, never before seen in this source. Of our four XMM-Newton/NuSTAR epochs, one fortuitously taken during a bright X-ray state has strong narrow absorption lines in the high-resolution grating spectra. From these absorption features, we determine that the obscurer is in fact a multiphase ionized wind with an outflow velocity of ∼5200 km s−1, and for the first time find evidence for a lower ionization component with the same velocity observed in absorption features in the contemporaneous Hubble Space Telescope spectra. This indicates that the UV absorption troughs may be due to dense clumps embedded in diffuse, higher ionization gas responsible for the X-ray absorption lines of the same velocity. We observe variability in the shape of the absorption lines on timescales of hours, placing the variable component at roughly 1000 Rg if attributed to transverse motion along the line of sight. This estimate aligns with independent UV measurements of the distance to the obscurer suggesting an accretion disk wind at the inner broad line region. We estimate that it takes roughly 200 days for the outflow to travel from the disk to our line of sight, consistent with the timescale of the outflow's column density variations throughout the campaign.

It is generally recognized that the electromagnetic multipolar emission from magnetars can be used to explain radiation from soft gamma repeaters or anomalous X-ray pulsars, but they have little impact on the spin-down of magnetars. We here present an analytical solution for the neutron star multipolar electromagnetic fields and their associated expected luminosities. We find that for newborn millisecond magnetars, the spin-down luminosity from higher multipolar components can match or even exceed that from the dipole component. Such high-intensity radiation will undoubtedly affect related astrophysical phenomena at the birth of a magnetar. We show that the spin-down luminosity from multipoles can well explain the majority of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows, from the plateau starting at several hundred seconds until the normal decay phase lasting for many years. The fitted magnetar parameters for GRB afterglows are all typical values, with spins in the millisecond range and magnetic field strengths on the order of 1014–1015 G. Our results, in turn, provide support for the hypothesis that GRBs originate from the birth of magnetars with a period of a few milliseconds, thus deepening our understanding of the complex magnetic field structure and the equation of state of magnetars.

总结:
研究通过高分辨率数值模拟和风洞模拟，了解尘埃在热银河风中的演化和存活情况。发现尘埃在所有情况下都能够在风中存活，甚至在没有冷相遮挡的情况下也是如此。根据模拟云团特性，估计0.1μm尘埃能够有60%存活并分布在晕气和冷相。还研究了尘埃颗粒大小对结果的影响，发现小于0.01μm的颗粒无法抵御热相暴露，说明观测到的CGM中的小颗粒要么是由大颗粒破碎产生，要么是在冷相中带到那里。最后，还表明尘埃气比随着距离的增加而下降，这为观测到的宇宙中大量尘埃提供了一个解释。<br /><br /> <div>
We present a suite of high-resolution numerical simulations to study the evolution and survival of dust in hot galactic winds. We implement a novel dust framework in the Cholla hydrodynamics code and use wind tunnel simulations of cool, dusty clouds to understand how thermal sputtering affects the dust content of galactic winds. Our simulations illustrate how various regimes of cloud evolution impact dust survival, dependent on cloud size, wind properties, and dust grain size. We find that significant amounts of dust can survive in winds in all scenarios, even without shielding from the cool phase of outflows. We present an analytic framework that explains this result, along with an analysis of the impact of cloud evolution on the total fraction of dust survival. Using these results, we estimate that 60% of 0.1 μm dust that enters a starburst-driven wind could survive to populate both the hot and cool phases of the halo, based on a simulated distribution of cloud properties. We also investigate how these conclusions depend on grain size, exploring grains from 0.1 μm to 10 Å. Under most circumstances, grains smaller than 0.01 μm cannot withstand hot-phase exposure, suggesting that the small grains observed in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) are either formed in situ due to the shattering of larger grains, or must be carried there in the cool phase of outflows. Finally, we show that the dust-to-gas ratio of clouds declines as a function of distance from the galaxy due to cloud–wind mixing and condensation. These results provide an explanation for the vast amounts of dust observed in the CGMs of galaxies and beyond.

总结:
本文通过分析Advanced Composition Explorer/Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer He+ double-coincidence pickup ion (PUI)的测量数据，研究了太阳圈与局部星际介质的相互作用。研究发现在1998年至2010年间，太阳风的流向并没有明显的变化趋势，通过拟合kappa函数和移除与日冕质量抛射相关的测量数据，得到这一结论。因此，可以得出太阳圈与局部星际介质的相互作用在该时期并没有发生明显的变化。 <div>
The size, shape, and composition of the heliosphere are affected by its interaction with the local interstellar medium. A means of quantifying this interaction is by measuring the relative motion of the two media. We determine the flow direction, , of the interstellar wind through the heliosphere and its trend over an 11 yr solar cycle using Advanced Composition Explorer/Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer He+ double-coincidence pickup ion (PUI) measurements from a data set spanning 13 full orbits, with focusing cone crossings occurring between the years 1998 and 2010. We measure the flow direction by fitting a kappa function to the focusing cone signature in the count rates of He+ at the PUI cutoff measured as a function of ecliptic longitude. We determine for each three-orbit boxcar centered on the years 1999 through 2009 and find the trend of the resulting linear fit. We account for solar transients by removing measurements associated with CMEs. However, there still may be effects from compression regions, such as stream–stream and corotating interaction regions. We additionally make considerations to ensure the PUI torus is in view, to account for varying interplanetary magnetic field angles, to ensure that we analyze newly injected interstellar PUIs largely unaffected by transport effects, and to account for general solar activity. We measure a slope in the flow direction to be 0.00° ± 0.51° yr−1, indicating that we do not measure a varying trend over this period. We repeat the focusing cone analysis for the combined data set and determine an overall flow direction of 75.37° ± 0.43°.

Barium stars are peculiar stars with enhanced slow neutron capture process (s-process) elements. Abundance analysis of them aids in better understanding the chemical evolution of the Milky Way. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven method named the memory-enhanced adaptive spectral network (MEASNet) to search for barium candidates in the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) low-resolution survey (LRS) and estimate the abundance of five s-process elements: Sr, Y, Ba, Ce, and Nd. MEASNet, trained using spectra from common stars in both LAMOST and the Galactic Archaeology with HERMES survey, showcases notable performance: for the classification task, precision = 98.22% and recall = 94.12%; in prediction, the mean absolute error for the seven elements range between 0.07 and 0.15 dex. After training, we apply the model to 4,083,003 stellar spectra from LAMOST DR10 LRS, successfully identifying 1,803,670 spectra of barium candidates ([Ba/Fe] ≥ 0.25 dex) along with their five s-process elemental abundances. The catalog enlarges the sample size, providing a wealth of data for further statistical analysis of the formation and evolution of barium stars. Meanwhile, this work highlights the potential value of MEASNet in star classification and abundance estimation, offering a strong reference for future data-driven models.

总结: 本文总结了关于微粒级硅石的压碎曲线行为的过去研究，并进行了补充实验，提出了一种新的幂律函数，可以用于类似微粒级硅石的模拟材料的撞击模拟。作者进行了基准研究，比较了新的压碎曲线与其他研究中常用的参数二次压碎曲线，发现典型的二次压碎曲线参数并不符合硅石压碎实验的情况，因此他们在撞击点附近低估了压缩，而在远离撞击点时高估了压缩。因此，本文提出的适用于数百帕至1.1GPa压力范围的新的压碎曲线可能更加精确。此外，它没有被特定案例的参数所校准，可以普遍适用于类似微粒级硅石的彗星或小行星等天体，只要假设其组成类似微粒级硅石。 <div>
Crush curves are of fundamental importance to numerical modeling of small and porous astrophysical bodies. The empirical literature often measures them for silica grains, and different studies have used various methods, sizes, textures, and pressure conditions. Here, we review past studies and supplement further experiments in order to develop a full and overarching understanding of the silica crush curve behavior. We suggest a new power-law function that can be used in impact simulations of analog materials similar to microgranular silica. We perform a benchmarking study to compare this new crush curve to the parametric quadratic crush curve often used in other studies, based on the study case of the DART impact onto the asteroid Dimorphos. We find that the typical quadratic crush curve parameters do not closely follow the silica crushing experiments, and as a consequence, they under (over) estimate compression close (far) from the impact site. The new crush curve presented here, applicable to pressures between a few hundred Pa and up to 1.1 GPa, might therefore be more precise. Additionally, it is not calibrated by case-specific parameters, and can be used universally for comet- or asteroid-like bodies, given an assumed composition similar to microgranular silica.

We examine Ulysses magnetic field observations from 1993 to 1996 as the spacecraft made its first fast-latitude scan from the southern to the northern hemisphere. Most of the observations we use are representative of high-latitude solar minimum conditions. We examine magnetic field power spectra characteristics of interplanetary turbulence at high frequencies, where the spectrum breaks from an inertial range into the ion dissipation range. The onset and spectral index of the dissipation spectrum are consistent with low-latitude observations at 1 au. Both ranges have a ratio of power in perpendicular magnetic field components to parallel components near 3. The power spectrum ratio test developed by Bieber et al. for single-spacecraft analyses that determines the underlying anisotropy of the wave vectors yields only marginally more energy associated with field-aligned wave vectors than perpendicular wave vectors when comparing the inertial and dissipation-range spectra. The lack of significant change in the anisotropies between the inertial and dissipation ranges contrasts strongly with the turbulence found typically for 1 au near-ecliptic observations, where significant differences in both anisotropies are observed.

In this paper we describe the survey design for the Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam Observations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) Cycle 1 JWST Treasury program, which executed its early imaging component in 2022 November. The UNCOVER survey includes ultradeep (∼29–30AB) imaging of ∼45 arcmin2 on and around the well-studied A2744 galaxy cluster at z = 0.308 and will follow up ∼500 galaxies with extremely deep low-resolution spectroscopy with the NIRSpec/PRISM during the summer of 2023, with repeat visits in summer 2024. We describe the science goals, survey design, target selection, and planned data releases. We also present and characterize the depths of the first NIRCam imaging mosaic, highlighting previously unparalleled resolved and ultradeep 2–4 μm imaging of known objects in the field. The UNCOVER primary NIRCam mosaic spans 28.8 arcmin2 in seven filters (F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M, and F444W) and 16.8 arcmin2 in our NIRISS parallel (F115W, F150W, F200W, F356W, and F444W). To maximize early community use of the Treasury data set, we publicly release the full reduced mosaics of public JWST imaging including 45 arcmin2 NIRCam and 17 arcmin2 NIRISS mosaics on and around the A2744 cluster, including the Hubble Frontier Field primary and parallel footprints.

该研究通过AstroSat和NICER在2017年对黑洞X射线双星源GRS 1915+105的同时观测进行了光谱-时间分析。结果表明，源表现出两个通量水平（高和低），其能谱可以用盘光子的热康普顿散射来描述。通过SXT/LAXPC和NICER/LAXPC的联合拟合获得的光谱参数是一致的。LAXPC和NICER的功率密度谱显示了一个约2赫兹的宽突出特征。这一特征的能量依赖性不能仅通过冠层光谱参数的变化来解释，而是需要一个模型来解释冠层加热速率的变化首先引起了盘温度和内半径的变化。我们的结果强调了AstroSat和NICER的同时观测的重要性，并强调了需要更复杂的模型来解释黑洞系统的光谱-时间行为。<br /><br />总结: 该研究利用AstroSat和NICER对黑洞X射线双星进行了光谱-时间分析，揭示了源的能谱和时间特性。研究结果表明，同时观测对于理解黑洞系统非常重要，并强调了需要更复杂的模型来解释这一行为。 <div>
In this study, we undertake a spectral-timing analysis of the black hole X-ray binary source GRS 1915+105 using simultaneous observations carried out by AstroSat (Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter, LAXPC and Soft X-ray Telescope, SXT) and Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) in 2017. The source showed two flux levels (high and low), whose energy spectra can be described by the thermal comptonization of disk photons. The spectral parameters obtained by the joint fitting of SXT/LAXPC and NICER/LAXPC were consistent. The power density spectra from LAXPC and NICER revealed a broad, prominent feature at ∼2 Hz. The energy dependence of the fractional rms and time lag of this feature cannot be explained by only variations of coronal spectral parameters. Instead, a model where the coronal heating rate varies first and induces a change in the disk temperature and inner radius can explain the variation. Our results underline the importance of simultaneous observations by AstroSat and NICER and highlight the need for more sophisticated models to explain the spectral-temporal behavior of black hole systems.

总结: <br /><br />该研究报告了对选定的明亮活动星系核进行的回响映射(RM)观测活动，旨在通过极大望远镜干涉仪上的GRAVITY仪器进行光谱测量，以充分监测其预期较大的广谱线区域(BLR)的大小。我们对五个对象IC 4329A、Mrk 335、Mrk 509、Mrk 1239和PDS 456的首次结果进行了报告，并且首次对Mrk 1239和PDS 456进行了光谱监测。我们获得了多年的监测数据，并进行了多组分光谱分解，以提取宽Hβ轮廓。我们检测到Hβ和连续变化之间存在显著的时间延迟，总体上与先前建立的BLR大小 - 亮度关系相吻合。速度分辨的Hβ时间延迟揭示了多样化的、可能是进化的BLR动力学。我们还从均值和rms光谱中测量了Hβ线宽，由此得到的毗律产品在不同观测季节之间表现出良好的一致性。采用统一的毗律因子和mean光谱中宽Hβ线的FWHM作为速度的度量，得到的黑洞质量分别为，，，和。我们还报告了使用其他线宽度度量方法进行的黑洞质量估算。对于之前进行过RM活动的对象，我们的质量估计与早先的结果一致。在附带的论文中，我们将使用BLR动力学建模来直接推测黑洞质量，从而确定毗律因子。 <div>
We conduct a reverberation mapping (RM) campaign to spectroscopically monitor a sample of selected bright active galactic nuclei with large anticipated broad-line region (BLR) sizes adequate for spectroastrometric (SA) observations by the GRAVITY instrument on the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. We report the first results for five objects, IC 4329A, Mrk 335, Mrk 509, Mrk 1239, and PDS 456, among which Mrk 1239 and PDS 456 are for the first time spectroscopically monitored. We obtain multiyear monitoring data and perform multicomponent spectral decomposition to extract the broad Hβ profiles. We detect significant time lags between the Hβ and continuum variations, generally obeying the previously established BLR size–luminosity relation. Velocity-resolved Hβ time lags illustrate diverse, possibly evolving, BLR kinematics. We further measure the Hβ line widths from mean and rms spectra and the resulting virial products show good consistency among different observing seasons. Adopting a unity virial factor and the FWHM of the broad Hβ line from the mean spectra as a measure of velocity, the obtained black hole masses averaged over seasons are , , , , and for the five objects, respectively. Black hole mass estimations using other line width measures are also reported. For objects with previous RM campaigns, our mass estimates are in agreement with earlier results. In a companion paper, we will employ BLR dynamical modeling to directly infer the black hole mass and thereby determine the virial factors.

这篇文章研究了来自遥远星系核的一些电磁突发现象，发现其在几个月至几年的时间尺度上重复，并且每个源都可以由超大质量黑洞周围的重复潮汐撕裂产生的吸积耀斑而来。研究通过分析估计和流体力学模拟，测试了rpTDE模型，发现高质量（≳1M⊙）演化恒星可以在与SMBH的多次碰撞中存活，并且几乎不损失质量，从而产生近乎相同振幅的定期吸积耀斑，这与ASASSN-14ko的表现相符。此外，星体受到潮汐力传递的能量可以导致其轨道周期的变化，这与ASASSN-14ko吸积耀斑重现时间的观测衰减相当。相反，低质量和未演化的恒星在相同近日点距离下会逐渐损失更多质量，从而产生更明亮的吸积耀斑，导致星体迅速毁灭和耀斑停止。这也说明了重复瞬变的光变曲线与恒星类型密切相关。总结：研究发现重复瞬变的光变曲线与恒星类型密切相关，高质量演化恒星能够产生近乎相同振幅的定期吸积耀斑，而低质量未演化的恒星则会产生更明亮的吸积耀斑并迅速毁灭。 <div>
Some electromagnetic outbursts from the nuclei of distant galaxies have been found to repeat on months-to-years timescales, and each of these sources can putatively arise from the accretion flares generated through the repeated tidal stripping of a star on a bound orbit about a supermassive black hole (SMBH), i.e., a repeating partial tidal disruption event (rpTDE). Here, we test the rpTDE model through analytical estimates and hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction between a range of stars, which differ from one another in mass and age, and an SMBH. We show that higher-mass (≳1M⊙), evolved stars can survive many (≳10−100) encounters with an SMBH while simultaneously losing few × 0.01M⊙, resulting in accretion flares that are approximately evenly spaced in time with nearly the same amplitude, quantitatively reproducing ASASSN-14ko. We also show that the energy imparted to the star via tides can lead to a change in its orbital period that is comparable to the observed decay in the recurrence time of ASASSN-14ko’s flares, . Contrarily, lower-mass and less-evolved stars lose progressively more mass and produce brighter accretion flares on subsequent encounters for the same pericenter distances, leading to the rapid destruction of the star and cessation of flares. Such systems cannot reproduce ASASSN-14ko-like transients, but are promising candidates for recreating events such as AT2020vdq, which displayed a second and much brighter outburst compared to the first. Our results imply that the lightcurves of repeating transients are tightly coupled with stellar type.

在这篇文章中，研究人员对附近星系的形状进行了深入分析，使用了前向建模方法来克服先前研究中的局限性，并且对比了观测结果和宇宙学模拟。他们发现TNG50模拟和HSC-SSP观测之间的卓越一致性挑战了先前的观点，即ΛCDM模型低估了薄星系的丰度。尤其是在星等小于10^9.5的星系中，观测和模拟之间的张力小于0.1σ，与先前报告的张力大于10σ形成鲜明对比。研究人员还发现，TNG50模拟中的低质量星系比HSC-SSP观测中的对应星系更加厚实，这被归因于虚假的动力学加热效应人为膨胀了星系。此外，他们还发现，尽管整体上存在广泛的一致性，TNG50模拟中的星系在低质量和高质量端更加集中，在中等质量范围内则较少集中。然而，研究人员认为低质量TNG50星系的较高集中度不太可能是它们更厚/更圆外观的原因。这项研究强调了进行模拟的模拟观测和应用一致的测量方法的重要性，以便与观测进行适当的比较。<br /><br />总结: 研究表明TNG50模拟中的星系形状与HSC-SSP观测结果有很好的一致性，挑战了先前的观点；模拟中的低质量星系比观测更厚实，这归因于虚假的动力学加热效应；整体上存在一致性，但在不同质量范围中有一些差异；对模拟进行模拟观测和应用一致的测量方法是很重要的。 <div>
We perform a thorough analysis of the projected shapes of nearby galaxies in both observations and cosmological simulations. We implement a forward-modeling approach to overcome the limitations in previous studies, which hinder accurate comparisons between observations and simulations. We measure axis ratios of z = 0 (snapshot 99) TNG50 galaxies from their synthetic Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) images and compare them with those obtained from real HSC-SSP images of a matched galaxy sample. Remarkably, the comparison shows excellent agreement between the observations and the TNG50 simulation, challenging previous claims that ΛCDM models underproduced the abundance of thin galaxies. Specifically, for galaxies with stellar masses , we find ≲0.1σ tensions between the observations and the simulation, a stark contrast to the previously reported ≳10σ tensions. We reveal that low-mass galaxies (M⋆ ≲ 109.5) in TNG50 are thicker than their observed counterparts in HSC-SSP and attribute this to the spurious dynamical heating effects that artificially puff up galaxies. We also find that, despite the overall broad agreement, TNG50 galaxies are more concentrated than the HSC-SSP ones at the low- and high-mass end of the stellar mass range of and are less concentrated at intermediate stellar masses. But we argue that the higher concentrations of the low-mass TNG50 galaxies are not likely the cause of their thicker/rounder appearances. Our study underscores the critical importance of conducting mock observations of simulations and applying consistent measurement methodologies to facilitate proper comparison with observations.

<title>Observations of Extremely Metal-poor O Stars: Weak Winds and Constraints for Evolution Models</title>

总结: 该研究使用Keck Cosmic Web Imager光谱观测了Leo P、Sextans A和WLM等附近矮星系中的三颗O型恒星，发现它们的基本恒星特性和辐射驱动风具有一些与当前恒星演化模型不符的现象。研究强调了在极低金属丰度下验证恒星质量、温度和光度之间的关系的重要性，以及未来针对金属贫乏恒星群体的质量损失和演化模型的发展。总的来说，这些发现为未来研究提供了实证基准。 <br /> <div>
Metal-poor massive stars drive the evolution of low-mass galaxies, both locally and at high redshift. However, quantifying the feedback they impart to their local surroundings remains uncertain because models of stellar evolution, mass loss, and ionizing spectra are unconstrained by observations below 20% solar metallicity (Z⊙). We present new Keck Cosmic Web Imager optical spectroscopy of three O-type stars in the nearby dwarf galaxies Leo P, Sextans A, and WLM, which have gas-phase oxygen abundances of 3%–14% Z⊙. To characterize their fundamental stellar properties and radiation-driven winds, we fit PoWR atmosphere models to the optical spectra simultaneously with Hubble Space Telescope far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra and multiwavelength photometry. We find that all three stars have effective temperatures consistent with their spectral types and surface gravities typical of main-sequence dwarf stars. Yet, the combination of those inferred parameters and luminosity for the two lower-Z stars is not reproduced by stellar evolution models, even those that include rotation or binary interactions. The scenario of multiple-star systems is difficult to reconcile with all available data, suggesting that these observations pose a challenge to current evolution models. We highlight the importance of validating the relationship between stellar mass, temperature, and luminosity at very low Z for accurate estimates of ionizing photon production and spectral hardness. Finally, all three stars’ FUV wind profiles reveal low mass-loss rates and terminal wind velocities in tension with expectations from widely adopted radiation-driven wind models. These results provide empirical benchmarks for future development of mass-loss and evolution models for metal-poor stellar populations.

<div> 高红移活跃星系核AGN, 复电离, JWST, 空间密度, 宇宙再电离<br /> 

在过去，高红移活跃星系核（AGN）曾被认为在复电离中扮演较小的角色，尽管Chandra和哈勃空间望远镜初期的证据支持它们在低亮度下的大空间密度。然而，最近JWST的观测发现在红移大于4时有相当数量的暗淡AGN，这确实证实了早期的研究结果。研究人员展示了红移约为5的AGN样本，这些样本来自于广泛的、浅层的地面调查和来自JWST的深层、铅笔光束观测，这使我们能够以前所未有的精度估计它们的空间密度。在红移约为5时，AGN亮度函数的亮端（M1450 < -26）已经得到了很好的限制，斜率相当陡峭。暗端（M1450 ≥ -22）表明有很高的空间密度，而波动很大，拐点（M1450 ~ -24）大部分尚未确定。与最先进的模型进行比较发现，在红移为5时，观测到的AGN亮度函数与预期的相当一致，而在更高红移时，预测的空间密度演化速度似乎过快。考虑到暗端的大方差，我们在拟合亮度函数和推导电离发射率时考虑了不同的选项。即使在最保守的情景中，红移约为5的AGN产生的光电离率也与紫外背景辐射的测量结果一致。观察到暗淡AGN空间密度的缓慢演化表明，活跃超大质量黑洞可能在红移大于6时不断产生大量的电离光子，远远超出再电离纪元。这是一个重要的指示，即高红移AGN可能是宇宙再电离的主要贡献者。<br /><br />总结: 过去高z AGN在再电离中的作用被低估，但JWST的观测证实了它们在红移大于4时的大量存在。红移约为5的AGN亮度函数显示出明显的斜率和高空间密度，而对比现代模型也有相当一致性。活跃超大质量黑洞可能在红移大于6时持续产生大量的电离光子，对宇宙再电离产生重要影响。 <div>
In the past, high-z active galactic nuclei (AGNs) were given a minor role as possible drivers of reionization, despite initial evidence in favor of their large space densities at low luminosities by Chandra and the Hubble Space Telescope. Recent observations from JWST are finding relatively large numbers of faint AGNs at z > 4, convincingly confirming these early results. We present a sample of z ∼ 5 AGNs, both from wide, shallow ground-based surveys and from deep, pencil-beam observations from JWST, allowing us to estimate their space densities with unprecedented accuracy. The bright end (M1450 < −26) of the z ∼ 5 AGN luminosity function is well constrained, with a rather steep slope. The faint end (M1450 ≥ −22) indicates a high space density, the scatter is significant, and the knee (M1450 ∼ −24) is mostly undetermined. Comparisons with state-of-the-art models find reasonable agreement with the observed AGN luminosity function at z = 5, while the predicted space density evolution at higher redshifts appears to be too fast with respect to observational constraints. Given the large variance at the faint end, we consider different options in fitting the luminosity functions and deriving the ionizing emissivity. Even in the most conservative scenario, the photoionization rate produced by z ∼ 5 AGNs is consistent with the ultraviolet background measurements. A slow evolution of the space density of faint AGNs is observed, indicating that active SMBHs are probably producing large amounts of ionizing photons at z > 6, well into the Epoch of Reionization. This is an important indication that high-z AGNs could be major contributors to the reionization of the Universe.

<div> Herbig Ae star MWC 480, CH3OCH3 detection, nontransitional Class II disk, high CH3OCH3/CH3OH ratio, chemical reprocessing

总结: 该研究报道了在Herbig Ae星MWC 480周围的盘中探测到了二甲醚（CH3OCH3），这是在非过渡性II类盘中首次发现CH3OCH3。观测显示CH3OCH3呈紧凑、未解析状态，半径≲25天文单位，线宽≈30 km/s，激发温度≈200 K，表明COMs在暖内盘中升华。尽管探测到了CH3OCH3，但并未探测到CH3OH，这导致了CH3OCH3/CH3OH的列密度比约为7。这一高比值表明在盘相阶段COMs发生重加工，以及内盘物理结构的影响。该研究还发现，这一比值高于最近发现的富含COMs的过渡盘。这可能表明在MWC 480的全盘中，COMs在内部经历了显著的化学重加工，而过渡盘中的COM发射主要跟踪了位于较大半径（≳20 au）的灰尘空洞边缘的继承冰的升华。 <br /><br /> <div>
Characterizing the chemistry of complex organic molecules (COMs) at the epoch of planet formation provides insights into the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM) and the origin of organic materials in our solar system. We report a detection of dimethyl ether (CH3OCH3) in the disk around the Herbig Ae star MWC 480 with sensitive Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations. This is the first detection of CH3OCH3 in a nontransitional Class II disk. The spatially unresolved, compact (≲25 au in radius) nature, broad line width (∼30 km s−1), and high excitation temperature (∼200 K) indicate the sublimation of COMs in the warm inner disk. Despite the detection of CH3OCH3, methanol (CH3OH), the most abundant COM in the ISM, has not been detected, from which we constrain the column density ratio of CH3OCH3/CH3OH ≳ 7. This high ratio may indicate the reprocessing of COMs during the disk phase, as well as the effect of the physical structure in the inner disk. We also find that this ratio is higher than in COM-rich transition disks recently discovered. This may indicate that in the full disk of MWC 480, COMs have experienced substantial chemical reprocessing in the innermost region, while the COM emission in the transition disks predominantly traces the inherited ice sublimating at the dust cavity edge located at larger radii (≳20 au).
