Vapor pressure is a relevant quantity that is necessary in order to improve the study of the atmosphere dynamics that take place within astrophysical scenarios. The aim of this study was to obtain the vapor pressure values of the following molecules: C2H4, C2H6, CH3OH, CH4, CO, CO2, H2O, and N2 through experimentation, as well as to determine their empirical relationship with the temperature, applying the results to the persistence of volatiles in trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) and Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs). The experimental determination was performed by measuring the sublimation rate for each molecule at different temperatures. The Hertz–Knudsen equation was used to obtain the vapor pressures for the aforementioned molecules, taking the necessary considerations into account, and the sublimation rate was measured using a quartz crystal microbalance. In order to check the validity of the methods used, the results obtained for water ice were compared with those of previous studies from the literature. The values obtained for CO, N2, and CH4 are of particular interest in the study of the TNOs' and KBOs' atmosphere composition. The results of this study improve the understanding of the surface and atmospheric composition of objects in the cold scenarios of the solar system, in particular, in KBOs and TNOs.

<div> 距离、消光、恒星参数、星表、天文学
总结:<br /><br />本研究介绍了Augustus星表，该表基于Pan-STARRS、2MASS、UKIDSS和unWISE的光学至近红外光度测量以及Gaia DR2和3D尘埃消光地图的视差测量，对1.7亿颗恒星进行了距离、消光和恒星参数的估计。经过质量筛选后，有1.25亿个目标具有高质量的后验概率，恒星类型确定后的统计距离不确定性约为10%。研究结果显示，该星表能够准确重现去除消光效应后的Gaia颜色-星等图，并且能够清晰地检测到包括Monoceros环和人马座流在内的大型、动力学上连贯的亚结构。研究结果已公开可用，并附有交互式可视化工具。 <div>
We present Augustus, a catalog of distance, extinction, and stellar parameter estimates for 170 million stars from 14 mag < r < 20 mag and with ∣b∣ > 10° drawing on a combination of optical to near-infrared photometry from Pan-STARRS, 2MASS, UKIDSS, and unWISE along with parallax measurements from Gaia DR2 and 3D dust extinction maps. After applying quality cuts, we find 125 million objects have “high-quality” posteriors with statistical distance uncertainties of ≲10% for objects with well-constrained stellar types. This is a substantial improvement over the distance estimates derived from Gaia parallaxes alone and in line with the recent results from Anders et al. We find the fits are able to reproduce the dereddened Gaia color–magnitude diagram accurately, which serves as a useful consistency check of our results. We show that we are able to detect large, kinematically coherent substructures in our data clearly relative to the input priors, including the Monoceros Ring and the Sagittarius Stream, attesting to the quality of the catalog. Our results are publicly available at doi:10.7910/DVN/WYMSXV. An accompanying interactive visualization can be found at http://allsky.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com.

<div> 关键词: 中国观测站, 太阳黑子, 语义分割, 半监督学习, 太阳活动周期

总结: <br /><br />这篇论文提出了一种新的半监督学习方法，结合了一种名为动态相互训练（DMT）边界引导语义分割（BGSeg）的语义分割方法，即DMT_BGSeg，以充分利用来自紫金山天文台（PMO）的标记数据和其他五个观测站的未标记数据，来检测和分割中国六个观测站的所有太阳黑子图纸中的太阳黑子组件。该方法有效地检测和分割了中国太阳黑子图纸中的太阳黑子，测试结果显示PMO，YNAO，BJP，NJU，QDOS和SSOS的平均IoU值分别为85.29，72.65，73.82，64.28，62.26和60.07。结果比较还表明DMT_BGSeg在中国太阳黑子图纸中检测和分割太阳黑子方面是有效的。太阳黑子的数量和面积被分别测量，所有详细数据都在中国虚拟天文台上公开分享，这将促进全球历史太阳黑子数据库的全面增加，并进一步促进对长期太阳活动周期和太阳动力学的理解。 <div>
China has six observing stations, providing over 52,000 handwritten sunspot drawings from 1947–2016. The observing stations are the Purple Mountain Astronomical Observatory (PMO), Yunnan Astronomical Observatory (YNAO), Qingdao Observatory Station (QDOS), Sheshan Observatory Station (SSOS), Beijing Planetarium (BJP), and Nanjing University (NJU). In this paper, we propose a new cotraining semisupervised learning method combining a semantic segmentation method named dynamic mutual training (DMT) boundary-guided semantic segmentation (BGSeg), i.e., DMT_BGSeg, which makes full use of the labeled data from PMO and the unlabeled data from the other five stations to detect and segment sunspot components in all sunspot drawings of the six Chinese stations. The sunspot is detected and segmented. Additionally, each sunspot is split into four types of components: pore, spot, umbra, and hole. The testing results show the mIoU values of PMO, YNAO, BJP, NJU, QDOS and SSOS are 85.29, 72.65, 73.82, 64.28, 62.26, and 60.07, respectively. The results of the comparison also show that DMT_BGSeg is effective in detecting and segmenting sunspots in Chinese sunspot drawings. The numbers and areas of sunspot components are measured separately. All of the detailed data are publicly shared on China-VO, which will advance the comprehensive augmentation of the global historical sunspot database and further the understanding of the long-term solar activity cycle and solar dynamo.

总结: 本文提出了一种改进的方法来模拟光回波光谱分析，相比以往的方法，能够更准确地估计瞬变事件每个阶段对观测光谱的真实相对贡献。作者讨论了他们的方法的逻辑，相比以往方法的优势及进一步改进的前景。最后，作者展示了新方法如何改进了对泰科超新星（SN 1572）回波的分析。  <div>
Light echoes give us a unique perspective on the nature of supernovae and nonterminal stellar explosions. Spectroscopy of light echoes can reveal details on the kinematics of the ejecta, probe asymmetry, and reveal details of ejecta interaction with circumstellar matter, thus expanding our understanding of these transient events. However, the spectral features arise from a complex interplay between the source photons, the reflecting dust geometry, and the instrumental setup and observing conditions. In this work, we present an improved method for modeling these effects in light echo spectra, one that relaxes the simplifying assumption of a light-curve-weighted sum, and instead estimates the true relative contribution of each phase of a transient event to the observed spectrum. We discuss our logic, the gains we obtain over light echo analysis methods used in the past, and prospects for further improvements. Lastly, we show how the new method improves our analysis of echoes from Tycho’s supernova (SN 1572) as an example.

The classical T Tauri star (CTTS) stage is a critical phase of the star and planet formation process. In an effort to better understand the mass accretion processes, which can dictate future stellar evolution and planet formation, a multiepoch, multiwavelength photometric and spectroscopic monitoring campaign of four CTTSs (TW Hya, RU Lup, BP Tau, and GM Aur) was carried out in 2021 and 2022/2023 as part of the Outflows and Disks around Young Stars: Synergies for the Exploration of ULLYSES Spectra program. Here we focus on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UV spectra obtained by the HST Director’s Discretionary Time UV Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) program. Using accretion shock modeling, we find that all targets exhibit accretion variability, varying from short increases in accretion rate by up to a factor of 3 within 48 hr to longer decreases in accretion rate by a factor of 2.5 over the course of 1 yr. This is despite the generally consistent accretion morphology within each target. Additionally, we test empirical relationships between accretion rate and UV luminosity and find stark differences, showing that these relationships should not be used to estimate the accretion rate for an individual target. Our work reinforces that future multiepoch and simultaneous multiwavelength studies are critical in our understanding of the accretion process in low-mass star formation.

<br />
TDE AT2018fyk被解释为与质量黑洞双星相关的一次性TDE。X射线，紫外线和光学光谱显示出不同于一般的特点，且在约600天后衰减，之后再次增强，并在1200天左右再次衰减。这种行为发生在一个黑洞中断了碎片再次回落到另一个黑洞时，自然地呈现出了t-5/3幂律的陡峭下降。黑洞质量M•从X射线光谱拟合和早期紫外/光学光谱拟合中得出，比从M•-σ*宿主星系关系预测的M•要小两个数量级，这表明碎片被吸积到了辅助黑洞上，而主黑洞则停止了回落。再者，如果增亮是与主黑洞相关的话，它应该在5000天左右而不是观察到的1200天左右发生。次要的质量和无量纲自旋都表明了一个中等质量的次要黑洞，这与观察到的紫外/光学光谱衰减一致，即次要黑洞的外部吸积盘过于微弱而无法产生可检测的辐射底线。第一次吸积中断的时间限制了二进制系统的间隔为(6.7±1.2)×10−3 pc。X射线光谱拟合和时间分析表明，硬X射线来自于次要黑洞盘上方的辐射区域。早期的紫外/光学辐射，暗示次要黑洞的超Eddington阶段，可能起源于碎片轨道化产生的激波。 <br /><br />总结: AT2018fyk是一次与大质量黑洞双星相关的潮撕裂事件。其X射线，紫外线和光学光谱显示出特殊的特点，这被解释为主黑洞中断了碎片再次回落到辅助黑洞所致。辅助黑洞的质量和维度自旋表明其为中等质量黑洞。X射线和早期紫外/光学辐射的分析显示了黑洞之间的二进制系统间隔。同时，X射线来自于次要黑洞盘上方的辐射区域，而早期的紫外/光学辐射可能源自于碎片轨道化产生的激波。 <div>
The tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2018fyk has unusual X-ray, UV, and optical light curves that decay over the first ∼600 days, rebrighten, and decay again around 1200 days. We explain this behavior as a one-off TDE associated with a massive black hole (BH) binary. The sharp drop-offs from t−5/3 power laws at around 600 days naturally arise when one BH interrupts the debris fallback onto the other BH. The BH mass M• derived from fitting X-ray spectra with a slim disk accretion model and, independently, from fitting the early UV/optical light curves, is smaller by 2 orders of magnitude than predicted from the M•–σ* host galaxy relation, suggesting that the debris is accreted onto the secondary, with the fallback cut off by the primary. Furthermore, if the rebrightening were associated with the primary, it should occur around 5000 days, not the observed 1200 days. The secondary’s mass and dimensionless spin is and a•,s > 0.3 (X-ray spectral fitting), while the primary’s mass is M•,p = 107.7±0.4M⊙ (M•–σ* relation). An intermediate mass BH secondary is consistent with the observed UV/optical light-curve decay, i.e., the secondary’s outer accretion disk is too faint to produce a detectable emission floor. The time of the first accretion cutoff constrains the binary separation to be (6.7 ± 1.2) × 10−3 pc. X-ray spectral fitting and timing analyses indicate that the hard X-rays arise from a corona above the secondary’s disk. The early UV/optical emission, suggesting a super-Eddington phase for the secondary, possibly originates from shocks arising from debris circularization.

<div> Hubble Space Telescope, COS/G160M, C IV, circumgalactic medium (CGM), supermassive black holes (SMBH)

对Hubble Space Telescope进行的COS/G160M观测研究了8个红移为z∼0、光度约为L⋆的星系的内部环星系介质（CGM）中的C IV，并与紫外明亮的类星体配对，它们的冲击参数（Rproj）在25到130千秒差距之间。这些星系的质量控制样本（log10M⋆/M⊙∼10.2–10.9 M⊙）中的恒星黑洞的质量经过动力学测量，范围在log10MBH/M⊙∼6.8–8.4之间；这使得我们能够将结果与模型进行比较，这些模型中，恒星黑洞的综合反馈历史改变了长时间尺度上的CGM。我们发现C IV柱密度测量（NC IV;平均log10NC IV,CH=13.94±0.09 cm−2）在很大程度上与其他调查中CGM中NC IV的现有测量（平均log10NC IV,Lit=13.90±0.08 cm−2）一致，但不会因为SMBH质量的函数而明显变化。相比之下，特定星形成率（sSFR）与CGM中的电离物质含量高度相关。对于具有log10MBH/M⊙>7.0的星系，我们发现sSFR存在较大的分散，其中CGM的C IV含量与星系的sSFR明显相关，但与MBH无关。我们的结果不表明CGM中C IV与星系SMBH质量存在明显的因果关系；然而，通过与EAGLE、Romulus25和IllustrisTNG模拟的比较，我们发现我们的样本可能太小，无法限制这样的因果关系。<br /><br />总结:该研究利用Hubble Space Telescope对C IV进行了研究，发现星系的C IV含量与SMBH质量无明显因果关系，但与特定星形成率相关。然而，研究也指出样本可能太小，无法排除因果关系。 <div>
We present an analysis of Hubble Space Telescope COS/G160M observations of C IV in the inner circumgalactic medium (CGM) of a novel sample of eight z ∼ 0, L ≈ L⋆ galaxies, paired with UV-bright QSOs at impact parameters (Rproj) between 25 and 130 kpc. The galaxies in this stellar-mass-controlled sample (log10M⋆/M⊙ ∼ 10.2–10.9 M⊙) host supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with dynamically measured masses spanning log10MBH/M⊙ ∼ 6.8–8.4; this allows us to compare our results with models of galaxy formation where the integrated feedback history from the SMBH alters the CGM over long timescales. We find that the C IV column density measurements (NC IV; average log10NC IV,CH = 13.94 ± 0.09 cm−2) are largely consistent with existing measurements from other surveys of NC IV in the CGM (average log10NC IV,Lit = 13.90 ± 0.08 cm−2), but do not show obvious variation as a function of the SMBH mass. By contrast, specific star formation rate (sSFR) is highly correlated with the ionized content of the CGM. We find a large spread in sSFR for galaxies with log10MBH/M⊙ > 7.0, where the CGM C IV content shows a clear dependence on galaxy sSFR but not MBH. Our results do not indicate an obvious causal link between CGM C IV and the mass of the galaxy’s SMBH; however, through comparisons to the EAGLE, Romulus25, and IllustrisTNG simulations, we find that our sample is likely too small to constrain such causality.

The Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array has revolutionized the field of dust polarization in protoplanetary disks across multiple wavelengths. Previous observations and empirical modeling have suggested multiple mechanisms of dust polarization toward HL Tau, including grain alignment and dust scattering. However, a detailed modeling of dust polarization based on grain alignment physics is not yet available. Here, using an updated POLARIS code, we perform numerical modeling of dust polarization arising from both grain alignment by the magnetically enhanced radiative torque mechanism and self-scattering to reproduce the HL Tau polarization observed at three wavelengths of 0.87, 1.3, and 3.1 mm. Our modeling results show that the observed multiwavelength polarization could be reproduced only when large grains contain embedded iron inclusions and those with slow internal relaxation must have wrong internal alignment (i.e., the grain’s major axis parallel to its angular momentum). The abundance of iron embedded inside grains in the form of clusters is constrained to be ≳16%, and the number of iron atoms per cluster is Ncl ∼ 9 × 102. Maximum grain sizes probed at wavelengths of λ = 0.87, 1.3, and 3.1 mm are constrained at ∼60, 80, and 90 μm, respectively.

<div> 关键词: Hα emission, Be stars, NGC 330, Magellanic Clouds, stellar population
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了利用Hα发射来评估年轻开放星团中经典Be星(CBe)的种群。通过使用SAMI进行多波段成像，研究了NGC 330的恒星种群。研究发现，在NGC 330中Hα发射体的总比例为4.4%，而在较高质量星体中高达32.8%。此外，发现了质量分层结构，表明NGC 330内存在明显的质量分层。这些发现突出了当前观察对于在NGC 330提供CBe星群的完整图片的重要性。 <div>
Hα emission is a clear indicator of circumstellar activity in Be stars, historically employed to assess the classical Be star (CBe) population in young open clusters (YOCs). The YOC NGC 330 in the Small Magellanic Cloud exhibits a large known fraction of CBe stars and was selected for a pilot study to establish a comprehensive methodology for identifying Hα emitters in the Magellanic Clouds, encompassing the entire B-type spectral range. Using the SOAR Adaptive Module Imager (SAMI), we investigated the stellar population of NGC 330 using multiband BVRI+Hα imaging. We identified Hα emitters within the entire V-band range covered by SAMI/SOAR observations (V ≲ 22), comprising the complete B-type stellar population and offering a unique opportunity to explore the Be phenomenon across all spectral subclasses. The stellar radial distribution shows a clear bimodal pattern between the most massive (B5 or earlier) and the lower mass main-sequence objects (later than B6) within the cluster. The former is concentrated toward the cluster center (showing a dispersion of σ = 4.26 ± 0.20 pc), whereas the latter extends across larger radii (σ = 10.83 ± 0.65 pc), indicating mass stratification within NGC 330. The total fraction of emitters is 4.4% ± 0.5%, notably smaller than previous estimates from flux- or seeing-limited observations. However, a higher fraction of Hα emitters is observed among higher mass stars (32.8% ± 3.4%) than within lower mass (4.4% ± 0.9%). Consequently, the putative CBe population exhibits distinct dynamical characteristics compared to the bulk of the stellar population in NGC 330. These findings highlight the significance of the current observations in providing a complete picture of the CBe population in NGC 330.

<div> gravitational scattering, three-body binary formation, unequal masses, wide-binary formation, energy dissipation<br />
总结:<br />
本研究探讨了三体双星形成问题，考虑了质量不相等、有限大小和后牛顿效应等因素。研究发现，三体双星形成多通过非共振相互作用实现，并且偏好形成宽双星。在宽双星中，三体双星形成时偏心率较高，这或许有助于解释天文观测中观测到的偏心率较高的宽双星。相比之下，硬双星形成相对较少，且具有热力学偏心率分布。能量耗散通过引力辐射导致从三个最初无关联体系中形成绑定的分级三体系统的概率较小。总的来说，本研究揭示了三体双星形成的一些重要特征和概率分布。 <div>
We explore three-body binary formation (3BBF), the formation of a bound system via gravitational scattering of three initially unbound bodies (3UB), using direct numerical integrations. For the first time, we consider systems with unequal masses, as well as finite-size and post-Newtonian effects. Our analytically derived encounter rates and numerical scattering results reproduce the 3BBF rate predicted by Goodman & Hut for hard binaries in dense star clusters. We find that 3BBF occurs overwhelmingly through nonresonant encounters and that the two most-massive bodies are never the most likely to bind. Instead, 3BBF favors pairing the two least-massive bodies (for wide binaries) or the most- plus least-massive bodies (for hard binaries). 3BBF overwhelmingly favors wide-binary formation with superthermal eccentricities, perhaps helping to explain the eccentric wide binaries observed by Gaia. Hard-binary formation is far rarer, but with a thermal eccentricity distribution. The semimajor axis distribution scales cumulatively as a3 for hard and slightly wider binaries. Although mergers are rare between black holes when including relativistic effects, direct collisions occur frequently between main-sequence stars—more often than hard 3BBF. Yet, these collisions do not significantly suppress hard 3BBF at the low-velocity dispersions typical of open or globular clusters. Energy dissipation through gravitational radiation leads to a small probability of a bound, hierarchical triple system forming directly from 3UB.

<br />这篇文章研究了附近非均匀性对观测者对哈勃常数推断的影响。大尺度结构引起了宇宙学参数对观察者位置的依赖性，以及这些参数在观察者视野中的各向异性方差。作者使用数值相对论模拟的大尺度结构和光线追踪相结合，生成了合成目录，模仿低红移Pantheon超新星数据集。数据包含模拟中测地线上距离和红移的广义相对论贡献。他们使用这些合成观测来约束一组随机位置的观察者的H0。研究了观察者位置的依赖性以及旋转SNe样本对观察者的天空的影响。他们发现当观察者使用各向同性样本时，H0在不同观察者之间有1%–2%的变化。然而，他们发现当观察者简单地在天空上旋转他们的Pantheon数据集时，推断的H0值可能会变化高达3%–6%。尽管我们发现的方差低于“哈勃张力”的水平，但我们的结果可能表明，如果能够正确考虑扩张的各向异性，张力的重要性可能会减少。<br /><br />总结: 本文研究了大尺度结构对观测者哈勃常数推断的影响，发现观察者位置和超新星样本旋转会对H0的推断产生1%–6%的变化。这可能暗示着在正确考虑扩张的各向异性情况下，哈勃张力的重要性可能会减少。 <div>
We study the impact of nearby inhomogeneities on an observer’s inference of the Hubble constant. Large-scale structures induce a dependence of cosmological parameters on observer position as well as an anisotropic variance of those parameters across an observer’s sky. While the former has been explored quite thoroughly, the latter has not. Incomplete sampling of an anisotropic sky could introduce a bias in our cosmological inference if we assume an isotropic expansion law. In this work, we use numerical relativity simulations of large-scale structure combined with ray tracing to produce synthetic catalogs mimicking the low-redshift Pantheon supernova (SN) data set. Our data contain all general-relativistic contributions to fluctuations in the distances and redshifts along geodesics in the simulation. We use these synthetic observations to constrain H0 for a set of randomly positioned observers. We study both the dependence on observer position as well as the impact of rotating the sample of SNe on the observer’s sky. We find a 1%–2% variance in H0 between observers when they use an isotropic sample of objects. However, we find the inferred value of H0 can change by up to 3%–6% when observers simply rotate their Pantheon data set on the sky. While the variances we find are below the level of the “Hubble tension,” our results may suggest a reduction in the significance of the tension if anisotropy of expansion can be correctly accounted for.

气泡形成的原因有两种分类：Type-I气泡是相对稳定的，持续几小时，表明存在准稳定的磁场拓扑；而Type-II气泡生长和崩溃迅速，在1小时内不稳定。观察发现Type-II气泡伴随着喷射小丝的迅速出现和扩展，与气泡边界相撞后崩溃，形成向上的大型喷流。这种崩溃的气泡形成与喷射小丝与上方日冕物质的相互作用有关。<br /><br />总结: <br />通过Hα观测发现气泡可分为稳定的Type-I和不稳定的Type-II两种。Type-II气泡伴随喷射小丝的迅速扩展，与气泡边界相撞后崩溃，形成向上的大型喷流。这种崩溃的气泡形成与喷射小丝与上方日冕物质的相互作用有关。 <div>
Prominence bubbles, the dark arch-shaped voids below quiescent prominences, are generally believed to be caused by the interaction between the prominences and the slowly emerging or quasi-stable underlying magnetic loops. However, this scenario could not explain some short-lived bubbles with extremely dynamic properties of evolution. Based on high-resolution Hα observations, here we propose that bubbles should be classified into two categories according to their dynamic properties: quasi-steady Type-I bubbles and transient Type-II bubbles. Type-I bubbles could remain relatively stable and last for several hours, indicating the existence of a quasi-stable magnetic topology, while Type-II bubbles grow and collapse quickly within 1 hr without stability duration, which are usually associated with erupting minifilaments. Analysis of several typical Type-II bubbles from different views, especially including an on-disk event, reveals that Type-II bubbles quickly appear and expand at a velocity of ∼5–25 km s−1 accompanied by an erupting minifilament below. The minifilament’s rising velocity is slightly larger than that of the Type-II bubbles’ boundary, which will lead to the collision with each other in a short time, subsequent collapse of Type-II bubbles, and formation of a large plume into the above prominence. We also speculate that only if the angle between the axis of the erupting minifilament and the line of sight is large enough, the interaction between the erupting minifilament and the overlying prominence could trigger a Type-II bubble with a typical arch-shaped but quickly expanding bright boundary.

红外光谱观测表明星际介质和太阳系冰中存在固体甲醇(CH3OH)，但冰中CH3OH的丰度需要准确的带强度、光学常数和参考光谱来推导。本文识别了文献中关于甲醇冰红外强度的分歧、遗漏和空白，包括几十年来未解决的问题。我们呈现了新的光谱，并通过固体CH3OH的折射率和密度的新数据来辅助强度测量。结果是不同实验室组的大量不一致结果现在可以得到解决。多种冰用于确定已知成分的H2O + CH3OH混合物的红外强度，可用于对星际冰的观测。也是首次，用不同厚度的CH3OH冰进行了测量，报告了行星科学家使用的两个近红外特征的带强度和光学常数。我们利用新的红外结果确定了固体CH3OH的蒸气压，并将其与石英晶体微天平测量进行了比较。对甲醇冰进行了热退火，并研究了固态中的相变。在可能的情况下将我们的结果与以前的工作进行了比较，并提供了我们新结果的电子版本。<br /><br />总结: 本文通过红外光谱观测确定了固体甲醇的存在，并消除了不同实验室组的不一致结果。还首次测量了H2O + CH3OH混合物和不同厚度的CH3OH冰的红外强度和光学常数。同时，还对固态甲醇的蒸气压和相变进行了研究。 <div>
Infrared spectroscopic observations have established the presence of solid methanol (CH3OH) in the interstellar medium and in solar system ices, but the abundance of frozen CH3OH cannot be deduced without accurate band strengths, optical constants, and reference spectra. In this paper we identify disagreements, omissions, and gaps in the literature on infrared (IR) intensities of methanol ices, including unaddressed concerns that reach back several decades. New spectra are presented with intensity measurements aided by new data on the index of refraction and density of solid CH3OH. The result is that the large discordant results from different laboratory groups can now be reconciled. Multiple ices have been used to determine, apparently for the first time, IR intensities of H2O + CH3OH mixtures of accurately known composition for use with observations of interstellar ices. Also for the first time, measurements on CH3OH ices with different thicknesses have allowed us to report both near-IR band strengths and optical constants for two near-IR features used by planetary scientists. We have used our new IR results to determine vapor pressures of solid CH3OH and have compared them to measurements made with a quartz-crystal microbalance. Thermal annealings of methanol ices have been carried out and phase changes in the solid state examined. Comparisons of our results to earlier work are presented where possible, and electronic versions of our new results are made available.

总结:<br />
本研究针对嵌入在活动星系核盘中的双黑洞系统进行了三维模拟，发现逆行双黑洞会比顺行双黑洞收缩得更快，并且其轨道离心率增长速度随着离心率呈单调递增趋势。结果表明，逆行双黑洞可能经历离心率快速增长，导致它们在近日点距离足够接近，从而被引力波辐射驱使合并。而顺行双黑洞收缩速度远快于其轨道离心率减小速度，因此它们在合并过程中可能保持适度的离心率。此外，由活动星系核盘驱动的双黑洞进动可能会主导，取决于双黑洞的吸积率和其在盘中的位置，这可能抑制了时间晕共振和von Ziepel–Lidov–Kozai循环效应。 <div>
Binary black holes (BBHs) embedded within the accretion disks that fuel active galactic nuclei (AGN) are promising progenitors for the source of gravitational wave (GW) events detected by LIGO/VIRGO. Several recent studies have shown that when these binaries form, they are likely to be highly eccentric and retrograde. However, many uncertainties remain concerning the orbital evolution of these binaries as they either inspiral toward merger or disassociate. Previous hydrodynamical simulations exploring their orbital evolution have been predominantly two-dimensional or have been restricted to binaries on nearly circular orbits. We present the first high-resolution, three-dimensional local shearing-box simulations of both prograde and retrograde eccentric BBHs embedded in AGN disks. We find that retrograde binaries shrink several times faster than their prograde counterparts and exhibit significant orbital eccentricity growth, the rate of which monotonically increases with binary eccentricity. Our results suggest that retrograde binaries may experience runaway orbital eccentricity growth, which may bring them close enough together at pericenter for GW emission to drive them to coalescence. Although their eccentricity is damped, prograde binaries shrink much faster than their orbital eccentricity decays, suggesting they should remain modestly eccentric as they contract toward merger. Finally, binary precession driven by the AGN disk may dominate over precession induced by the supermassive black hole depending on the binary accretion rate and its location in the AGN disk, which can subdue the evection resonance and von Ziepel–Lidov–Kozai cycles.

<br />
总结:<br />
这篇文章主要研究了太阳耀斑期间的两种重要现象，即色球蒸发（CE）和日冕雨（CR），并且使用了IRIS和AIA进行观测和比较。研究发现CE标志着热量流入耀斑环的开始，而CR标志着以冷、致密凝结的形式流出的末端。CE的观测结果显示，其上升平均速度为138 ± 35 km/s，温度为9.03 ± 3.28 × 106 K。此外，CR在耀斑过程中的变化也得到了观测，其质量和密度增加约4.4和6倍，速度增加约1.4倍，而团块宽度变化不明显。研究结果还发现，CE的位置和形态与CR的位置和形态非常相似，说明它们在质量和能量传输方面起着关键作用。此外，研究还得出CR的能量相当于CE能量的一半，表明CR在耀斑的质量-能量循环中起着重要作用。 <div>
Chromospheric evaporation (CE) and coronal rain (CR) represent two crucial phenomena encompassing the circulation of mass and energy during solar flares. While CE marks the start of the hot inflow into the flaring loop, CR marks the end, indicating the outflow in the form of cool and dense condensations. With the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we examine and compare the evolution, dynamics, morphology, and energetics of the CR and CE during a C2.1 flare. The CE is directly observed in imaging and spectra in the Fe xxi line with IRIS and in the Fe xviii line of AIA, with upward average total speeds of 138 ± 35 km s−1 and a temperature of 9.03 ± 3.28 × 106 K. An explosive-to-gentle CE transition is observed, with an apparent reduction in turbulence. From quiescent to gradual flare phase, the amount and density of CR increase by a factor of ≈4.4 and 6, respectively. The rain’s velocity increases by a factor of 1.4, in agreement with gas pressure drag. In contrast, the clump width variation is negligible. The location and morphology of CE match closely those of the rain showers, with similar CE substructure to the rain strands, reflecting fundamental scales of mass and energy transport. We obtain a CR outflow mass three times larger than the CE inflow mass, suggesting the presence of unresolved CE, perhaps at higher temperatures. The CR energy corresponds to half that of the CE. These results suggest an essential role of CR in the mass−energy cycle of a flare.

The chemical abundances of Milky Way’s (MW's) satellites reflect their star formation histories (SFHs), yet, due to the difficulty of determining the ages of old stars, the SFHs of most satellites are poorly measured. Ongoing and upcoming surveys will obtain around 10 times more medium-resolution spectra for stars in satellites than are currently available. To correctly extract SFHs from large samples of chemical abundances, the relationship between chemical abundances and SFHs needs to be clarified. Here, we perform a high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulation of a MW-like galaxy with detailed models of star formation, supernova (SN) feedback, and metal diffusion. We quantify SFHs, metallicity distribution functions, and the α-element (Mg, Ca, and Si) abundances in satellites of the host galaxy. We find that star formation in most simulated satellites is quenched before infalling to their host. Star formation episodes in simulated satellites are separated by a few hundred Myr owing to SN feedback; each star formation event produces groups of stars with similar [α/Fe] and [Fe/H]. We then perform a mock observation of the upcoming Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) observations. We find that Subaru PFS will be able to detect distinct groups of stars in [α/Fe] versus [Fe/H] space, produced by episodic star formation. This result means that episodic SFHs can be estimated from the chemical abundances of ≳1000 stars determined with medium-resolution spectroscopy.

总结: 
内部重力波可能会在恒星内部引起混合。研究表明，这些波造成的混合会随着年龄和质量的变化而发生显著改变。本文通过考虑零龄主序和中期主序时的7太阳质量模型，来研究旋转对这种波混合的影响。我们比较了一系列旋转速率（1 × 10^-5, 2 × 10^-5, 3 × 10^-5, 4 × 10^-5, 和 1 × 10^-4 rad s^-1）时的混合剖面，观察到随着罗斯贝数的减小，混合减少。这可以归因于旋转对对流的影响，它影响了在对流-辐射界面附近激发波的振幅。 <br /><br /> <div>
Internal gravity waves are likely to cause mixing in stellar interiors. Studies show that the mixing by these waves changes drastically across age and mass. Here, we study the effect of rotation on this wave mixing by considering a 7 M⊙ model at zero-age main sequence and mid-main sequence. We compare the mixing profiles at a range of rotation rates (1 × 10−5, 2 × 10−5, 3 × 10−5, 4 × 10−5, and 1 × 10−4 rad s−1) and observe that the mixing decreases with decreasing Rossby number. This can be attributed to the effect of rotation on convection, which influences the amplitude with which the waves are excited near the convective–radiative interface.

We present photometric and spectroscopic observations and analysis of the Type IIb supernova (SN) SN 2019tua, which exhibits multiple bumps in its declining light curves between 40 and 65 days after discovery. SN 2019tua shows a time to peak of about 25 days, similar to other Type IIb SNe. Our observations indicate a decrease in its brightness of about 1 mag in the 60 days after the peak. At about days 50 and 60, its multiband light curves exhibit bumpy behavior. The complex luminosity evolution of SN 2019tua could not be well modeled with a single currently popular energy source model, e.g., radioactive decay of 56Ni, magnetar, interaction between the ejecta and a circumstellar shell. Even though the magnetar model has a smaller χ2/dof value, the complex changes in SN 2019tua’s brightness suggest that more than one physical process might be involved. We propose a hybrid circumstellar medium (CSM) interaction plus 56Ni model to explain the bolometric light curve of SN 2019tua. The fitting results show that the ejecta mass Mej ≈ 2.4 M⊙, the total CSM mass MCSM ≈ 1.0 M⊙, and the 56Ni mass MNi ≈ 0.4 M⊙. The total kinetic energy of the ejecta is Ek ≈ 0.5 × 1051 erg. Preexisting multiple shells suggest that the progenitor of SN 2019tua experienced mass ejections within approximately ∼6–44 yr prior to the explosion.

总结:<br />
SN H0pe是在红移z=1.78处使用James Webb太空望远镜发现的一个三重成像超新星。通过NIRSpec的跟进光谱，首先确定了SN的分类为Ia型，并测量了三个影像的相对时间延迟。利用Hsiao07 SN模板，确定了三个影像的绝对相位，并得出了它们之间的时间延迟。通过SALT3-NIR模型验证了这些值的一致性。研究还发现，在使用Hsiao07模板光谱进行模拟时，对推断出的影像延迟有一些影响，但是这种影响在统计上并不显著。 <div>
SN H0pe is a triply imaged supernova (SN) at redshift z = 1.78 discovered using the James Webb Space Telescope. In order to classify the SN spectroscopically and measure the relative time delays of its three images (designated A, B, and C), we acquired NIRSpec follow-up spectroscopy spanning 0.6–5 μm. From the high signal-to-noise spectra of the two bright images B and C, we first classify the SN, whose spectra most closely match those of SN 1994D and SN 2013dy, as a Type Ia SN. We identify prominent blueshifted absorption features corresponding to Si iiλ6355 and Ca ii H λ3970 and K λ3935. We next measure the absolute phases of the three images from our spectra, which allow us to constrain their relative time delays. The absolute phases of the three images, determined by fitting the three spectra to Hsiao07 SN templates, are days, days, and days for the brightest to faintest images. These correspond to relative time delays between Image A and Image B and between Image B and Image C of days and days, respectively. The SALT3-NIR model yields phases and time delays consistent with these values. After unblinding, we additionally explored the effect of using Hsiao07 template spectra for simulations through 80 days instead of 60 days past maximum, and found a small (11.5 and 1.0 days, respectively) yet statistically insignificant (∼0.25σ and ∼0.1σ) effect on the inferred image delays.

该研究通过观察彗星Leonard（C/2021 A1）的尾巴与太阳风的相互作用，采用太阳风模型和新的数据同化技术进行对比分析。结果表明，尾巴的脱离是由于穿越日地电流片和进入SIR（流相互作用区）导致的。这一结果更加符合数据同化模型的预测，表明了这种方法的价值。这些案例研究扩展了我们对彗星与太阳风相互作用的理解，同时也展示了数据同化在太阳风建模中的实用性。研究还指出，彗星可以作为添加的太阳风条件的实时测量方式，特别是在没有现有实时探测器的区域，这有望进一步改进未来的太阳风数据同化。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
Cometary tails display dynamic behavior attributed to interactions with solar wind structures. Consequently, comet-tail observations can serve as in situ solar wind monitors. During 2021 December, Comet Leonard (C/2021 A1) was observed by the STEREO-A heliospheric imager. The comet tail exhibited various signatures of interactions with the solar wind including bending, kink formation, and finally complete disconnection. In this study, we compare the timing of these events with solar wind structures predicted by the Heliospheric Upwind eXtrapolation model with a time-dependency (or HUXt) solar wind model using new solar wind data assimilation (DA) techniques. This serves both to provide the most accurate solar wind context to interpret the cometary processes, but also as a test of the DA and an example of how comet observations can be used in model validation studies. Coronal mass ejections, stream interaction regions (SIRs), and heliospheric current sheet (HCS) crossings were all considered as potential causes of the tail disconnection. The results suggest the tail disconnection at Comet Leonard was the result of it crossing the HCS and into an SIR. The timing of these features agree better with the DA model results than the non-DA model, showing the value of this approach. Case studies such as this expand our understanding of comet–solar wind interactions, and in demonstrating the utility of DA for solar wind modeling. We note that this could lead to comets acting as additional in situ measures for solar wind conditions for regions where no in situ spacecraft are available, potentially improving solar wind DA in the future.

总结:

这篇文章研究了太阳大气中的小型丝状结构的形成和爆发机制。观察到的变化包括丝状结构从弓形线转变为两个J形弧，并最终形成S形。同时，在丝状结构的南部发生了两次等离子体耀斑。爆发起始于南部，然后与上方的大型丝状结构相互作用并失败。观测到的磁场异常与观测结果相一致。研究结果表明，爆发是由于丝状结构核心磁场与外部磁场由于磁通消除而引起的磁重连。这项研究揭示了丝状结构爆发的新触发机制，以及丝状结构爆发和等离子体耀斑之间的新关系。 <div>
Minifilaments are widespread small-scale structures in the solar atmosphere. To better understand their formation and eruption mechanisms, we investigate the entire life of a sigmoidal minifilament located below a large quiescent filament observed by Big Bear Solar Observatory/Goode Solar Telescope on 2015 August 3. The Hα structure initially appears as a group of arched threads, then transforms into two J-shaped arcades, and finally forms a sigmoidal shape. Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly observations in 171 Å show that two coronal jets occur around the southern footpoint of the minifilament before the minifilament eruption. The minifilament eruption starts from the southern footpoint, then interacts with the overlying filament and fails. The aforementioned observational changes correspond to three episodes of flux cancellations observed by SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager. Unlike previous studies, the flux cancellation occurs between the polarity where the southern footpoint of the minifilament is rooted and an external polarity. We construct two magnetic field models before the eruption using the flux rope insertion method and find a hyperbolic flux tube above the flux cancellation site. The observation and modeling results suggest that the eruption is triggered by the external magnetic reconnection between the core field of the minifilament and the external fields due to flux cancellations. This study reveals a new triggering mechanism for minifilament eruptions and a new relationship between minifilament eruptions and coronal jets.

We present a suite of models of the coherent magnetic field of the Galaxy based on new divergence-free parametric functions describing the global structure of the field. The model parameters are fit to the latest full-sky Faraday rotation measures (RMs) of extragalactic sources and polarized synchrotron intensity (PI) maps from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and Planck. We employ multiple models for the density of thermal and cosmic-ray electrons in the Galaxy, needed to predict the sky maps of RMs and PI for a given Galactic magnetic field (GMF) model. The robustness of the inferred properties of the GMF is gauged by studying many combinations of parametric field models and electron density models. We determine the pitch angle of the local magnetic field (11° ± 1°), explore the evidence for a grand-design spiral coherent magnetic field (inconclusive), determine the strength of the toroidal and poloidal magnetic halo fields below and above the disk (magnitudes the same for both hemispheres within ≈10%), set constraints on the half-height of the cosmic-ray diffusion volume (≥2.9 kpc), investigate the compatibility of RM- and PI-derived magnetic field strengths (compatible under certain assumptions), and check if the toroidal halo field could be created by the shear of the poloidal halo field due to the differential rotation of the Galaxy (possibly). A set of eight models is identified to help quantify the present uncertainties in the coherent GMF spanning different functional forms, data products, and auxiliary input. We present the corresponding sky maps of rates for axion–photon conversion in the Galaxy and deflections of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays.

<div> 关键词: Type II supernovae, Zwicky Transient Facility, UV light curves, shock cooling, X-ray observations

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章通过对34个正常类型II超新星（SNe II）的样本进行研究，提供了多波段的UV光曲线以及X射线观测数据。研究表明，早期UV-光学颜色和黑体的演变与冲击冷却（SC）一致，即使存在“闪烁电离”特征。此外，文章提出了一个适合SC模型的框架，可以复现多组模拟的参数。通过X射线数据，得出大多数SN II的母体恒星在爆炸前几年失去了。研究还发现，红超巨星（RSGs）爆炸成为SNe II的半径符合观测到的RSGs半径分布，但尾部延伸至更大的半径，这可能是由于周围存在星周物质的存在。 <div>
We present a sample of 34 normal Type II supernovae (SNe II) detected with the Zwicky Transient Facility, with multiband UV light curves starting at t ≤ 4 days after explosion, and X-ray observations. We characterize the early UV-optical color, provide empirical host-extinction corrections, and show that the t > 2 day UV-optical colors and the blackbody evolution of the sample are consistent with shock cooling (SC) regardless of the presence of “flash ionization” features. We present a framework for fitting SC models that can reproduce the parameters of a set of multigroup simulations up to 20% in radius and velocity. Observations of 15 SNe II are well fit by models with breakout radii <1014 cm. Eighteen SNe are typically more luminous, with observations at t ≥ 1 day that are better fit by a model with a large >1014 cm breakout radius. However, these fits predict an early rise during the first day that is too slow. We suggest that these large-breakout events are explosions of stars with an inflated envelope or with confined circumstellar material (CSM). Using the X-ray data, we derive constraints on the extended (∼1015 cm) CSM density independent of spectral modeling and find that most SN II progenitors lose up to a few years before explosion. We show that the overall observed breakout radius distribution is skewed to higher radii due to a luminosity bias. We argue that the of red supergiants (RSGs) explode as SNe II with breakout radii consistent with the observed distribution of RSGs, with a tail extending to large radii, likely due to the presence of CSM.

<title>JWST Reveals Powerful Feedback from Radio Jets in a Massive Galaxy at z = 4.1</title>

<div> 关键词: TNJ1338-1942, JWST, ionized gas outflow, radio galaxy, mass outflow rate<br />
总结: 
TNJ1338-1942星系是一个具有强大离子化气体流出的高红移星系，通过JWST的近红外光谱仪(NIRSpec)观测到了15千秒巨大的流出，并测量了流出速率。观测显示出流出的气体速度超过900 km/s，宽度超过1200 km/s，空间上与最亮的无线电叶重叠。这表明无线电射流对流出动力学负责。总质量流出率约为500 M⊙年，动能远大于流出离子化气体的能量。这意味着动能从射流转移到气体的效率不高。由此推测大部分的能量可能以热X射线为形式。
<br /><br /> <div>
We report observations of a powerful ionized gas outflow in the z = 4.1 luminous radio galaxy TNJ1338-1942 hosting an obscured quasar using the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on board JWST. We spatially resolve a large-scale (∼15 kpc) outflow and measure outflow rates. The outflowing gas shows velocities exceeding 900 km s−1 and broad line profiles with widths exceeding 1200 km s−1 located at an ∼10 kpc projected distance from the central nucleus. The outflowing nebula spatially overlaps with the brightest radio lobe, indicating that the powerful radio jets are responsible for the outflow kinematics. The gas is possibly ionized by the obscured quasar with a contribution from shocks induced by the jets. The mass outflow rate map shows that the region with the broadest line profiles exhibits the strongest outflow rates. The total mass outflow rate is ∼500 M⊙ yr−1, and the mass loading factor is ∼1, indicating that a significant part of the gas is displaced outwards by the outflow. Our hypothesis is that the overpressured shocked jet fluid expands laterally to create an expanding ellipsoidal “cocoon” that causes the surrounding gas to accelerate outwards. The total kinetic energy injected by the radio jet is about 3 orders of magnitude larger than the energy in the outflowing ionized gas. This implies that kinetic energy must be transferred inefficiently from the jets to the gas. The bulk of the deposited energy possibly lies in the form of hot X-ray-emitting gas.

<div> 关键词: Super-Kamiokande, Galactic core-collapse supernova, SK-Gd, neutrino detection, SN monitoring system
总结: <br /><br />这篇文章总结了Super-Kamiokande (SK)在探测银河系核心坍缩超新星爆发的多信使观测中的关键作用，特别是通过增加水中的钆浓度来提高中子探测能力，改进了实时超新星监测系统，并介绍了SK_SN Notice预警系统的发布和功能。文章还通过模拟银河系超新星，分析了SK-Gd对不同超新星模型的指向精度，发现其指向精度在3°至7°之间。此外，文章还提到了SK_SN Notice可以在距离小于10千秒差距的情况下提供3度精度的报警，有利于天文望远镜的后续观测。 <div>
Among multimessenger observations of the next Galactic core-collapse supernova, Super-Kamiokande (SK) plays a critical role in detecting the emitted supernova neutrinos, determining the direction to the supernova (SN), and notifying the astronomical community of these observations in advance of the optical signal. In 2022, SK has increased the gadolinium dissolved in its water target (SK-Gd) and has achieved a Gd concentration of 0.033%, resulting in enhanced neutron detection capability, which in turn enables more accurate determination of the supernova direction. Accordingly, SK-Gd’s real-time supernova monitoring system has been upgraded. SK_SN Notice, a warning system that works together with this monitoring system, was released on 2021 December 13, and is available through GCN Notices. When the monitoring system detects an SN-like burst of events, SK_SN Notice will automatically distribute an alarm with the reconstructed direction to the supernova candidate within a few minutes. In this paper, we present a systematic study of SK-Gd’s response to a simulated Galactic SN. Assuming a supernova situated at 10 kpc, neutrino fluxes from six supernova models are used to characterize SK-Gd’s pointing accuracy using the same tools as the online monitoring system. The pointing accuracy is found to vary from 3° to 7° depending on the models. However, if the supernova is closer than 10 kpc, SK_SN Notice can issue an alarm with three-degree accuracy, which will benefit follow-up observations by optical telescopes with large fields of view.

<div> 关键词: Parker Solar Probe, 冠状物质抛射, 等离子体加速, 磁流体结构, 电子通量

总结:
帕克太阳探测器在0.2天文单位观察到了一个事件，该事件显示了成像和原位测量的一致性，证实了冠状物质抛射（CME）的磁流体结构内存在磁力线圈。在CME的边缘结构中，存在孤立的磁通管、湍流护层以及CME本身。湍流护层和CME区间的分布更均匀，谱线更软，Fe/O和He/H的丰度比低于孤立的磁通管，但高于典型的等离子体和太阳高能粒子丰度。这表明了来自耀斑和等离子体的加速粒子增强。孤立的磁通管显示了大的流动、硬谱线和较大的Fe/O和He/H比值，表明有耀斑源。在CME区间，从超热到高能粒子能量范围内，能量粒子通量增强，表明有粒子加速和在封闭磁结构内的约束。CME的磁力线圈形态有助于局部调制和困留高能粒子，特别是沿着螺旋度通道和其他等离子体边界。因此，CME有助于积聚高能粒子群，使它们在内部太阳圈层内被输送到后续的高能粒子加速。 <div>
We present an event observed by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) at ∼0.2 au on 2022 March 2 in which imaging and in situ measurements coincide. During this event, PSP passed through structures on the flank of a streamer blowout coronal mass ejection (CME) including an isolated flux tube in front of the CME, a turbulent sheath, and the CME itself. Imaging observations and in situ helicity and principal variance signatures consistently show the presence of flux ropes internal to the CME. In both the sheath and the CME interval, the distributions are more isotropic, the spectra are softer, and the abundance ratios of Fe/O and He/H are lower than those in the isolated flux tube, and yet elevated relative to typical plasma and solar energetic particle abundances. These signatures in the sheath and the CME indicate that both flare populations and those from the plasma are accelerated to form the observed energetic particle enhancements. In contrast, the isolated flux tube shows large streaming, hard spectra, and large Fe/O and He/H ratios, indicating flare sources. Energetic particle fluxes are most enhanced within the CME interval from suprathermal through energetic particle energies (∼keV to >10 MeV), indicating particle acceleration, as well as confinement local to the closed magnetic structure. The flux-rope morphology of the CME helps to enable local modulation and trapping of energetic particles, in particular along helicity channels and other plasma boundaries. Thus, the CME acts to build up energetic particle populations, allowing them to be fed into subsequent higher-energy particle acceleration throughout the inner heliosphere where a compression or shock forms on the CME front.

总结:
本文通过对四个开放星团的研究发现，星团的潮汐尾巴中的星星数量存在对称性偏差，明显偏向于前导尾巴。研究表明，在牛顿引力下，星团的演化速度比Milgromian 动力学下更慢，COIN-Gaia 13星团已经几乎完全解散。这一发现对牛顿引力的正确性提出了质疑。由此引出了对广义相对论的相关测试和银河系的旋转曲线的讨论。 <div>
Stars that evaporate from their star cluster by the energy equipartition process end up in either a leading or a trailing tidal tail. In Newtonian gravitation and for open star clusters in the solar vicinity, the tidal threshold, or práh, for escape is symmetrical, such that the leading and trailing tails are equally populated. The data from six independent teams that applied the convergent point method to map out the tidal tails of four open clusters (the Hyades, Praesepe, Coma Berenices, and COIN-Gaia 13) using Gaia DR2 and DR3 are here applied to test for the expected symmetry. All tidal tails contain more stars in the leading tail. The combined confidence amounts to an 8σ falsification of the práh symmetry. The same test using Milgromian dynamics leads to consistency with the data. More effort needs to be exerted on this matter, but the data indicate with high confidence that the tidal práh of an open star cluster is asymmetrical, with the corresponding confidence that Newtonian gravitation is falsified. Open star clusters depopulate more rapidly in Milgromian than in Newtonian dynamics, and the COIN-Gaia 13 cluster is here found to be nearly completely dissolved. In view of these results, the wide-binary star test and the finding of a Keplerian Galactic rotation curve are briefly discussed.

In star clusters, close stellar encounters can strongly impact the architecture of a planetary system or even destroy it. We present a systematic study of the effects of stellar flybys on two-planet systems. When such a system experiences flybys, one or both planets can be ejected, forming free-floating planets (FFPs), captured planets (CPs) around the flyby star, and free-floating binary planets (BPs); the remaining single-surviving planets (SSPs) can have their orbital radii and eccentricities greatly changed. Through numerical experiments, we calculate the formation fractions (or branching ratios) of FFPs, SSPs, CPs, and BPs as a function of the pericenter distance of the flyby, and use them to derive analytical expressions for the formation rates of FFPs, SSPs, CPs and BPs in general cluster environments. We find that the production rates of FFPs and SSPs are similar (for the initial planet semimajor axis ratio a1/a2 = 0.6–0.8), while the rate for CPs is a few times smaller. The formation fraction of BPs depends strongly on a1/a2 and on the planet masses. For Jupiter-mass planets, the formation fraction of BPs is always less than 1% (for a1/a2 = 0.8) and typically much smaller (≲0.2% for a1/a2 ≲ 0.7). The fraction remains less than 1% when considering 4MJ planets. Overall, when averaging over all flybys, the production rate of BPs is less than 0.1% of that of FFPs. We also derive the velocity distribution of FFPs produced by stellar flybys, and the orbital parameter distributions of SSPs, CPs, and BPs. These results can be used in future studies of exotic planets (including FFPs) and planetary systems.

ASKAP J173608.2–321635是一种射电瞬变现象，在2020年的观测中表现出多个特征，包括不同时期的通量密度、带内谱指数、旋转测量值和极化特征。根据数据解释，该源被推测为与不断变化的环境相互作用的高声速中子星。 <div>
The radio transient ASKAP J173608.2–321635, at the position (ℓ, b) = (356.°0872, −0.°0390), was serendipitously observed by The H i/OH/Recombination line survey of the Galactic center at three epochs in 2020 March, 2020 April, and 2021 February. The source was detected only on 2020 April 11 with a flux density of 20.6 ± 1.1 mJy at 1.23 GHz and in-band spectral index of α = −3.1 ± 0.2. The commensal Very Large Array Low-band Ionsophere and Transient Experiment simultaneously detected the source at 339 MHz with a flux density of 122.6 ± 20.4 mJy, indicating a spectral break below 1 GHz. The rotation measure (RM) in 2020 April was 63.9 ± 0.3 rad m−2, which almost triples the range of the variable RM observed by Wang et al. to ∼130 rad m−2. The polarization angle, corrected for Faraday rotation, was 97° ± 6°. The 1.23 GHz linear polarization was 76.7% ± 3.9% with wavelength-dependent depolarization, indicating a Faraday depth dispersion of . We find an upper limit to the circular polarization of ∣V∣/I < 10.1%. Interpretation of the data in terms of diffractive scattering of radio waves by a plasma near the source indicates an electron density and a line-of-sight magnetic field strength within a factor of 3 of ne ∼ 2 cm−3 and B∥ ∼ 2 × 105μG. Combined with causality limits to the size of the source, these parameters are consistent with the low-frequency spectral break resulting from synchrotron self-absorption, not free–free absorption. A possible interpretation of the source is a highly supersonic neutron star interacting with a changing environment.

这篇文章研究了f(R)引力理论下的宇宙大爆炸核合成，并考虑了辐射时代原始黑洞对引力的修改所引入的额外自由度。研究发现，在一定范围的scalaron质量下，锂的丰度降低了3-4倍，这有助于解决宇宙锂问题。同时，氦的丰度符合观测界限。然而，氘的丰度提高了3-6倍，这需要恒星形成和演化过程对原始氘的破坏具有高效率，这在scalaron引力理论中是可能的。文章还提出了scalaron质量与黑洞质量的新关系，并指出了在这一scalaron质量范围内的原始黑洞可作为非重子暗物质的潜在候选者。最后，文章推断了幂律f(R)引力与原始黑洞的大爆炸等效性，并指出这种黑洞可以被即将到来的引力波探测器所探测到。<br /><br />总结: 这篇文章研究了f(R)引力理论下的宇宙大爆炸核合成，发现特定范围的scalaron质量下，锂的丰度降低，氦的丰度符合观测界限，氘的丰度增加。文章还提出了scalaron质量与黑洞质量的关系，并推断了幂律f(R)引力与原始黑洞的大爆炸等效性。 <div>
f(R) gravity is one of the serious alternatives of general relativity with a large range of astronomical consequences. In this work, we study Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) in f(R) gravity theory. We consider a modification to gravity due to the existence of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the radiation era that introduce additional degrees of freedom known as scalarons. We calculate the light element abundances by using the BBN code PArthENoPE. It is found that for a range of scalaron mass (2.2 − 3.5) × 104 eV, the abundance of lithium is lowered by 3−4 times the value predicted by general relativistic BBN, which is a level desired to address the cosmological lithium problem. For the above scalaron mass range, the helium abundance is within the observed bound. However, the deuterium abundance is found to be increased by 3−6 times the observed primordial abundance. It calls for a high efficiency of stellar formation and evolution processes for the destruction of primordial deuterium, which is suggested as possible in scalaron gravity. A novel relation between scalaron mass and black hole mass has been used to show that the above scalaron mass range corresponds to PBHs of subplanetary mass (∼1019 g) serving as one of the potential candidates of nonbaryonic dark matter. We infer Big Bang equivalence of power-law f(R) gravity with PBHs that are detectable with upcoming gravitational wave detectors.

总结: 本文介绍了对AGEL调查中七个星系尺度透镜的透镜模型。利用HST/WFC3-F140W图像和GLEE软件进行建模，测量了折射器星系的总密度分布和γ-z关系。通过比较观测和模型预测的速度离散度，验证了透镜模型；得出平均密度梯度斜率为-1.95±0.09和γ-z关系在z<1时不随红移变化的结论。文章指出观测和模拟之间的冲突可能是由于透镜和动力学模型中的系统误差，观测与模拟之间的比较难度，以及假定总质量分布为简单的幂律。AGEL调查将提供更多zdefl>0.5的透镜，为当前理论模型预测的质量分布随红移演化提供更强的约束。<br /><br /> <div>
Observed evolution of the total mass distribution with redshift is crucial to testing galaxy evolution theories. To measure the total mass distribution, strong gravitational lenses complement the resolved dynamical observations that are currently limited to z ≲ 0.5. Here we present the lens models for a pilot sample of seven galaxy-scale lenses from the ASTRO3D Galaxy Evolution with Lenses (AGEL) survey. The AGEL lenses, modeled using HST/WFC3-F140W images with Gravitational Lens Efficient Explorer (GLEE) software, have deflector redshifts in the range 0.3 < zdefl < 0.9. Assuming a power-law density profile with slope γ, we measure the total density profile for the deflector galaxies via lens modeling. We also measure the stellar velocity dispersions (σobs) for four lenses and obtain σobs from SDSS-BOSS for the remaining lenses to test our lens models by comparing observed and model-predicted velocity dispersions. For the seven AGEL lenses, we measure an average density profile slope of −1.95 ± 0.09 and a γ–z relation that does not evolve with redshift at z < 1. Although our result is consistent with some observations and simulations, it differs from other studies at z < 1 that suggest the γ–z relation evolves with redshift. The apparent conflicts among observations and simulations may be due to a combination of (1) systematics in the lensing and dynamical modeling; (2) challenges in comparing observations with simulations; and (3) assuming a simple power law for the total mass distribution. By providing more lenses at zdefl > 0.5, the AGEL survey will provide stronger constraints on whether the mass profiles evolve with redshift as predicted by current theoretical models.

这篇文章研究了小尺度动力机的特性，其中假设速度场的相关时间为零。然后使用不为零的相关时间模型来研究动力机性能的影响。文章假设速度场为不可压缩的高斯随机场，并在傅里叶空间中推导了磁场的两点相关的演化方程的最低阶修正。然后得到了在非螺旋紊流中磁场的纵向相关函数（ML）的演化方程，该方程适用于任意的普朗特尔数。在高普朗特尔数的极限下进一步简化了这个方程，并发现磁场能量的增长率比先前报道的要小得多。尽管如此，磁场功率谱仍然在高普朗特尔数下保留了 Kazantsev形式。

本文研究了小尺度动力机的特性，使用了不同的相关时间模型，并得到了磁场的演化方程。在高普朗特尔数的极限下发现磁场能量的增长率较先前报道的要小，但磁场功率谱仍保留了Kazantsev形式。 <div>
The small-scale dynamo is typically studied by assuming that the correlation time of the velocity field is zero. Some authors have used a smooth renovating flow model to study how the properties of the dynamo are affected by the correlation time being nonzero. Here, we assume the velocity is an incompressible Gaussian random field (which need not be smooth), and derive the lowest-order corrections to the evolution equation for the two-point correlation of the magnetic field in Fourier space. Using this, we obtain the evolution equation for the longitudinal correlation function of the magnetic field (ML) in nonhelical turbulence, valid for arbitrary Prandtl number. The nonresistive terms of this equation do not contain spatial derivatives of ML of order greater than 2. We further simplify this equation in the limit of high Prandtl number, and find that the growth rate of the magnetic energy is much smaller than previously reported. Nevertheless, the magnetic power spectrum still retains the Kazantsev form at high Prandtl number.

总结:<br /><br />本文介绍了通过宇宙学参数对扩展的平面引力模型进行限制的方法。研究人员使用了马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛分析来处理包括宇宙年代测量、重子声学振荡和Pantheon+SH0ES在内的三个数据集，以获得受限制的结果。然后，他们将这些结果与各种宇宙参数进行比较和验证，并与三个知名模型做出比较。该研究表明，宇宙学参数是限制宇宙学模型的有力工具，对于更好地理解宇宙的动力学和暗能量等方面具有重要意义。 <div>
As a classical approach, the dynamics of the Universe, influenced by its dark components, are unveiled through prior modifications of Einstein’s equations. Cosmography, on the other hand, is a highly efficient tool for reconstructing any modified theory in a model-independent manner. By employing kinematic variables, it offers a profound explanation for cosmic expansion. Although the cosmographical approach has been highly successful in several geometric theories in recent years, it has not been extensively explored in coupled gravities. With this in mind, we intend to constrain an extended teleparallel gravity model, , through cosmographic parameters. We utilize Taylor series expansion, assuming a minimally coupled form, to constrain the unknowns involved in the series. To achieve this, we conduct a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using three different data sets (cosmic chronometers, baryon acoustic oscillations, and Pantheon+SH0ES). The constrained results obtained from MCMC are then compared and verified using various cosmological parameters. Finally, we compare the resulting models with three well-known models.

双中子星合并被认为是短γ射线爆发的主要来源，并且产生了重元素。然而，对于双中子星的空间速度分布仍知之甚少。本研究利用VLBA确定了两个银河系双中子星的视运动和视差，并对所有11个具有准确视运动测量的双中子星进行了横向速度的估计。研究发现，双中子星的横向速度可能与自转周期、轨道离心率和伴星质量相关。得出的速度分布结果表明双中子星能够从宿主星系中逃逸，并留在超微弱暗星系中，为这些星系的重元素丰度作出了解释。研究还探讨了未来通过星表确定的双中子星的速度分布的多模态特征。

The mergers of double neutron star (DNS) systems are believed to drive the majority of short γ-ray bursts (SGRBs), while also serving as production sites of heavy r-process elements. Despite being key to (i) confirming the nature of the extragalactic SGRBs, (ii) addressing the poorly understood r-process enrichment in the ultrafaint dwarf galaxies (UFDGs), and (iii) probing the formation process of DNS systems, the space velocity distribution of DNSs is still poorly constrained, due to the small number of DNSs with well-determined astrometry. In this work, we determine new proper motions and parallaxes of two Galactic DNSs, PSR J0509+3801 and PSR J1930−1852, using the Very Long Baseline Array, and we estimate the transverse velocities v⊥ of all 11 isolated Galactic DNSs having proper-motion measurements in a consistent manner. Our correlation analysis reveals that the DNS v⊥ is tentatively correlated with three parameters: spin period, orbital eccentricity, and companion mass. With the preliminary v⊥ distribution, we obtain the following findings. First, the refined v⊥ distribution is confirmed to agree with the observed displacements of the localized SGRBs from their host galaxy birth sites. Second, we estimate that around 11% and 25% of DNSs remain gravitationally bound to UFDGs with escape velocities of 15 and 25 km s−1, respectively. Hence, the retained DNSs might indeed be responsible for the r-process enrichment confirmed so far in a few UFDGs. Finally, we discuss how a future ensemble of astrometrically determined DNSs may probe the multimodality of the v⊥ distribution.

总结:<br />
本文研究了2022年3月25日观测到的一个扭曲的、指向地球的日冕物质抛射（CME）。文章采用了三个远程感知与三个原位观测卫星的数据，并发现CME前端在纬度和经度上都出现了扭曲，其中Solar Orbiter观测显示出的地向纬度扭曲低至约6个太阳半径。同时，近地区极紫外观测表明这种扭曲是由于CME与附近赤道日冕孔的更快风速相互作用所致。研究还采用了改进的GCS模型来评估CME扭曲对其传播的影响，并将结果与拖曳模型和WSA-Enlil MHD模型进行比较。结果表明，虽然该事件复杂，但在不同的距离处到达时间的误差要比文献中的典型误差（约8-10小时）低得多（约4小时误差）。 <div>
Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), drivers of the most severe Space Weather disturbances, are often assumed to evolve self-similarly during their propagation. However, open magnetic field structures in the corona, leading to higher-speed streams in the ambient solar wind, can be source of strong distortions of the CME front. In this paper, we investigate a distorted and Earth-directed CME observed on 2022 March 25 combining three remote sensing with three in situ observatories at different heliocentric distances (from 0.5 to 1 au). Near quadrature observations by Solar Orbiter and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory revealed a distortion of the CME front in both latitude and longitude, with Solar Orbiter observations showing an Earth-directed latitudinal distortion as low as ≈6 R⊙. Near-Earth extreme-ultraviolet observations indicated the distortion was caused by interaction with faster wind from a nearby equatorial coronal hole. To evaluate the effect of the distortion on the CME's propagation, we adopted a three-point-of-view graduated cylindrical shell (GCS) fitting approach. For the first time, the GCS results are combined with an additional heliospheric single-viewpoint that looks further out in the heliosphere, revealing a deceleration in the CME before reaching ≈100 R⊙. The CME geometry and velocity determined by this enhanced GCS are used to initialize a drag-based model and a WSA-Enlil MHD model. The estimated times of arrival are compared with in situ data at different heliocentric distances and, despite the complexity of the event, the error in the arrival times at each spacecraft results much lower (≈4 hr error) than the typical errors in literature (≈8–10 hr).

<br />这项研究分析了10个年轻（0.9-2.1百万年）和低金属丰度（0.34-0.83太阳金属丰度）的星团，这些星团位于银河外围，银心距在10到13千秒差距之间。使用从UKIDSS获得的JHK数据，对低质量恒星（0.2-2太阳质量）计算的盘分数值在不同星团中范围从42%到7%。为了增强分析的统计可靠性，研究还从先前的研究中获取了八个低金属丰度星团，这些星团的金属丰度范围在0.25-0.85太阳金属丰度，加上我们的样本，总共有18个低金属丰度的星团。我们发现，低金属丰度星团中的盘分数平均比太阳金属丰度星团低了2.6 ± 0.2倍。在我们可以探测到的年龄范围内，本研究没有发现低于太阳金属丰度区域的盘盘分数下降更快的证据。此外，我们观察到两个不同年龄组（0.3-1.4和1.4-2.5百万年）的星团盘分数与金属丰度之间存在正相关。我们强调，星团的年龄和金属丰度显著影响了具有内盘的恒星比例。<br /><br />总结: 本研究分析了低金属丰度星团中原行星盘的分布，发现低金属丰度的星团盘分数明显低于太阳金属丰度的星团。在已知的年龄范围内，未发现低金属丰度区域的盘盘分数下降更快的证据。此外，星团盘分数与金属丰度之间存在正相关。 <div>
The role of metallicity in shaping protoplanetary disk evolution remains poorly comprehended. This study analyzes the disk fraction of 10 young (0.9–2.1 Myr) and low-metallicity (0.34–0.83 Z⊙) clusters located in the outer Milky Way with Galactocentric distances between 10 and 13 kpc. Using JHK data obtained from UKIDSS, the calculated disk fraction values for low-mass stars (0.2–2 M⊙) ranged from 42% to 7%. To enhance the statistical reliability of our analysis, eight additional low-metallicity clusters are sourced from previous studies with metallicity range 0.25–0.85 Z⊙ along with our sample, resulting in a total of 18 regions with low metallicity. We find that low-metallicity clusters exhibit on average a 2.6 ± 0.2 times lower disk fraction compared to solar-metallicity clusters in all the age bins we have. Within the age range we can probe, our study does not find evidence of faster disk decay in subsolar-metallicity regions compared to solar-metallicity regions. Furthermore, we observe a positive correlation between cluster disk fraction and metallicity for two different age groups of 0.3–1.4 and 1.4–2.5 Myr. We emphasize that both cluster age and metallicity significantly affect the fraction of stars with evidence of inner disks.

研究人员在近邻的亮红外塞弗特星系NGC 7469的中心3.3千秒差距范围内，结合JWST/MIRI成像、CO(2-1)数据和22 GHz射电数据，以及1.3mm尘埃连续数据，探索星形成过程。NGC 7469拥有一个主导整体星形成活动的星暴环。通过22 GHz射电数据和CO(2-1)发现全球星形成速率(SFR)约为11.5 M⊙ yr−1，冷分子气体质量M(H2)约为6.4 × 10^9M☉。1.3mm地图显示出与22 GHz和JWST观测到的7.7微米多环芳烃(PAH)发射相似的形态。三种迹象很好地重现了星暴环的形态。研究了PAHs、SFR和冷分子气体之间的相关性，发现PAHs与星形成的相关性比与CO的相关性更强，在星暴环内的相关性比外部地区更陡。推导了SFR和冷分子气体质量面密度之间的相关性，即Kennicutt-Schmidt (K-S)星形成定律。将NGC 7469与其他星暴星系和活动星系核等星系进行比较，突显出NGC 7469在K-S关系中呈现出中间行为。 
<br /><br />总结: 该研究利用多种观测数据和方法探索了NGC 7469星系中心3.3千秒差距范围内的星形成过程，并发现了星暴环的主导作用、PAHs与星形成的相关性以及星形成定律的相关性。与其他星系的比较表明，NGC 7469在星形成方面呈现出中间行为。 <div>
We investigate the star formation process within the central 3.3 kpc region of the nearby luminous infrared Seyfert NGC 7469, probing scales ranging from 88 to 330 pc. We combine JWST/MIRI imaging with the F770W filter, with CO(2 – 1) and the underlying 1.3 mm dust continuum data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, along with Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array radio continuum observations at 22 GHz. NGC 7469 hosts a starburst ring which dominates the overall star formation activity. We estimate the global star formation rate (SFR) ∼ 11.5 M⊙ yr−1 from the radio at 22 GHz, and a cold molecular gas mass M(H2) ∼ 6.4 × 109M☉ from the CO(2 – 1) emission. We find that the 1.3 mm map shows a morphology remarkably similar to those traced by the 22 GHz and the 7.7 μm polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission observed with JWST. The three tracers reproduce the morphology of the starburst ring with good agreement. We further investigate the correlations between the PAHs, the SFR, and the cold molecular gas. We find a stronger correlation of the PAHs with star formation than with CO, with steeper correlations within the starburst ring (n > 2) than in the outer region (n < 1). We derive a correlation between the SFR and the cold molecular gas mass surface densities, the Kennicutt–Schmidt (K-S) star formation law. Comparisons with other galaxy populations, including starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei, highlighted that NGC 7469 exhibits an intermediate behavior to the K-S relations found for these galaxy populations.

这篇文章讨论了太阳上的六次丝状物喷发事件，并展示了丝状物遮挡部分太阳盘造成的He ii 304 Å光度曲线的变暗特征。事件具有类似的形态特征，起源于活跃区内的小丝状物，随后迅速扩张遮挡大面积的太阳盘或明亮的耀斑区域。分析结果显示，这些变暗事件的持续时间为0.4-7.0小时，最大变暗深度为6.2%，最大变暗面积占太阳盘面积的5.6%。还发现变暗深度和面积之间存在正相关关系，这有助于在恒星观测中限制丝状物的尺寸。 <div>
Filament eruptions often lead to coronal mass ejections (CMEs) on the Sun and are one of the most energetic eruptive phenomena in the atmospheres of other late-type stars. However, the detection of filament eruptions and CMEs on stars beyond the solar system is challenging. Here, we present six filament eruption cases on the Sun and show that filament material obscuring part of the solar disk can cause detectable dimming signatures in Sun-as-a-star flux curves of He ii 304 Å. Those filament eruptions have similar morphological features, originating from small filaments inside active regions and subsequently strongly expanding to obscure large areas of the solar disk or the bright flare regions. We have tracked the detailed evolution of six obscuration dimmings and estimated the dimming properties, such as dimming depths, dimming areas, and duration. The largest dimming depth among the six events under study is 6.2% accompanied by the largest dimming area of 5.6% of the solar disk area. Other events have maximum dimming depths in a range of around 1%–3%, with maximum areas varying between about 3%–4% of the solar disk area. The duration of the dimming spans from around 0.4–7.0 hr for the six events under study. A positive correlation was found between the dimming depth and area, which may help to set constraints on the filament sizes in stellar observations.

The existence of two distinct and apparently unrelated populations of dusty stellar objects in the Nuclear Stellar Cluster of the Milky Way, namely IRS 13 and the S-cluster, are potentially prone to a general process describing the star formation history in the Galactic center (GC). The former cluster is thought to be entangled in the clockwise and counterclockwise disks, a large-scale stellar distribution revealed by the analysis of stars at different distances from Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole in the GC. Recently, this large-scale distribution was reported to exhibit a multidisk structure with at least four components. Motivated by this finding, we revisit the anisotropic IRS 13 cluster and find strong evidence for a disk-like structure. An examination of about 50 individual stellar orbits reveals a new structure that does not follow any trend known in the literature. Furthermore, we investigate the possibility of an inspiral cluster undergoing star formation processes, as proposed by several authors. Using a simplified N-body simulation to reproduce our observational results, we conclude that, under certain conditions, a massive cluster can migrate from the Circum Nuclear Disk toward the inner parsec. Based on this classification, we revisit the large-scale NACO Very Large Telescope (VLT) observations of IRS 13 and find evidence for a separation of the cluster into a gravitationally stable core remnant and a dissipating part. With the velocity-resolved H30α line and the broadband spectral energy distribution of IRS 13 E3, we provide tentative support for the existence of an intermediate-mass black hole of ∼3 × 104M⊙ surrounded by a hot gaseous stream.

A tidal disruption event (TDE) may occur when a star is torn apart by the tidal force of a black hole (BH). Eventually, an accretion disk is thought to form out of stellar debris falling back toward the BH. If the star’s orbital angular momentum vector prior to disruption is not aligned with the BH spin angular momentum vector, the disk will be tilted with respect to the BH equatorial plane. The disk will eventually be drawn into the BH equatorial plane due to a combination of the Bardeen–Petterson effect and internal torques. Here, we analyze the X-ray and UV observations of the TDE AT2020ocn obtained by Swift, XMM-Newton, and Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR. The X-ray light curve shows strong flares during the first ≈100 days, while, over the same period, the UV emission decays gradually. We find that the X-ray flares can be explained by a model that also explains the spectral evolution. This model includes a slim disk viewed under a variable inclination plus an inverse-Comptonization component processing the slim disk emission. A scenario where the ongoing Lense–Thirring precession during the disk alignment process is responsible for the observed inclination variations is consistent with the data. In later observations, we find that the X-ray spectrum of AT2020ocn becomes harder, while the mass accretion rate remains at super-Eddington levels, suggesting the formation of a corona in line with accretion onto other compact objects. We constrain the BH mass to be M⊙ at the 1σ (68%) confidence level.

Partially ionized plasmas consist of charged and neutral particles whose mutual collisions modify magnetic reconnection compared with the fully ionized case. The collisions alter the rate and locations of the magnetic dissipation heating and the distribution of energies among the particles accelerated into the nonthermal tail. We examine the collisional regimes for the onset of fast reconnection in two environments: the partially ionized layers of the solar atmosphere, and the protoplanetary disks that are the birthplaces for planets around young stars. In both these environments, magnetic nulls readily develop into resistive current sheets in the regime where the charged and neutral particles are fully coupled by collisions, but the current sheets quickly break down under the ideal tearing instability. The current sheets collapse repeatedly, forming magnetic islands at successively smaller scales, until they enter a collisionally decoupled regime where the magnetic energy is rapidly turned into heat and charged-particle kinetic energy. Small-scale, decoupled fast reconnection in the solar atmosphere may lead to preferential heating and energization of ions and electrons that escape into the corona. In protoplanetary disks such reconnection causes localized heating in the atmospheric layers that produce much of the infrared atomic and molecular line emission observed with the Spitzer and James Webb Space Telescopes.

This study aims to shed light on this phenomenon by focusing on a sample that encompasses all known repeating CL active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Through the identification of a characteristic timescale for the CL phenomenon, it was observed that larger SMBHs possess shorter characteristic timescales, while smaller SMBHs exhibit longer timescales. These findings reveal a significant contrast to the traditional AGN variability that has been adequately explained by the AGN’s disk instability model. This stark discrepancy highlights a distinct origin of the CL phenomenon, distinguishing it from traditional AGN variability. By properly predicting the characteristic timescale and its dependence on SMBH mass, we propose that the CL phenomenon is likely a result of a variation in accretion rate caused by a sudden change in the supply of circumnuclear gas during the transition between active and passive SMBH fueling stages.

<div> tSZ, MUSTANG2, 90 GHz, Galaxy clusters, Source contamination

这篇论文报告了利用热Sunyaev–Zel'dovich效应（tSZ）在243个星系团中进行的盲目调查，使用Green Bank望远镜上的MUSTANG2在90 GHz进行了调查，将5σ检测限定为每个星系团中心的1 mJy。文章发现了24个离散源，其中大多数（18个）对应于已知的射电源，其中有五个显示出明显的变化迹象，要么是随时间变化，要么是频谱指数变化。其余的源在其他波长没有明确的对应物。通过tSZ强烈依赖于90 GHz的观测来搜索星系团，而发现的源可能会对星系团的质量估计产生偏差。文章将结果与Websky模拟进行了比较，发现模拟与观测在星系团中心的匹配良好，但在外围的源分布上不匹配。在距离星系团中心104″以上的源使tSZ信号偏高，部分源的偏差可高达50%。在整个星系团种群中平均后，效应较小，但仍在1%–2%的水平。文章还发现，与先前的测量和模拟不同，他们在星系团外围观察到了源计数的增加，而在tSZ选择的样本的中心观察到的源较少。 <br /><br />总结: tSZ观测在90 GHz进行了Galaxy clusters的盲目调查，发现了24个离散源，其中大多数对应已知的射电源，还比较了观测结果与模拟结果，在星系团的外围发现了源计数的增加并发现了一些源对tSZ信号的偏差。 <div>
In this paper, we present the results of a blind survey for compact sources in 243 Galaxy clusters that were identified using the thermal Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect (tSZ). The survey was carried out at 90 GHz using MUSTANG2 on the Green Bank Telescope and achieved a 5σ detection limit of 1 mJy in the center of each cluster. We detected 24 discrete sources. The majority (18) of these correspond to known radio sources, and of these, five show signs of significant variability, either with time or in spectral index. The remaining sources have no clear counterparts at other wavelengths. Searches for galaxy clusters via the tSZ strongly rely on observations at 90 GHz, and the sources found have the potential to bias mass estimates of clusters. We compare our results to the Websky simulation that can be used to estimate the source contamination in galaxy cluster catalogs. While the simulation shows a good match to our observations at the clusters’ centers, it does not match our source distribution further out. Sources over 104″ from a cluster’s center bias the tSZ signal high, for some of the sources found, by over 50%. When averaged over the whole cluster population, the effect is smaller but still at a level of 1%–2%. We also discovered that unlike previous measurements and simulations, we see an enhancement of source counts in the outer regions of the clusters and fewer sources than expected in the centers of this tSZ-selected sample.

<div> 星系、椭圆星系、星的形成、光谱、形态图<br />
通过空间分辨光谱学的研究，我们发现了一群罕见的具有星形成特征的椭圆星系。我们利用星际介质综合模型输出、深度学习目录的形态学结果以及MaNGA Pipe3D增值目录的解析和综合特性相结合，识别出了59个星形成椭圆星系。与我们的主要样本SF-E相比，我们还构建了两个控制样本：星形成螺旋星系（SF-Sps；2419个星系）和静止椭圆星系（Q-Es；684个星系）。SF-E的Hα发射线通量与螺旋星系相似，D4000光谱指数表明SF-E具有老年和年轻的恒星群。SF-E的质量加权恒星年龄和金属丰度低于Q-E，67%的主要样本的恒星和气体速度图显示出动力学扰动的迹象。所有这些结果表明，SF-E通过近期的合并或与其他星系的相互作用获得了贫金属气体，并且正在形成新一代的星。此外，我们还将主要样本的SF-E分为四类，根据它们的球状星系/总发光度比（B/T）和自旋参数。这四类具有各自独特的演化历史和形成方式。基于这些结果，我们建议哈勃图不能准确捕捉星系演化过程，我们需要一个修订的形态图，如梳形态图，才能完整地了解星系的演化过程。<br /><br />总结: 通过空间分辨光谱学研究发现了59个星形成的椭圆星系，它们通过合并或与其他星系互动获取了贫金属气体，并产生了新一代的星。此外，作者还根据恒星年龄和金属丰度将这些星系分为四类，具有不同的演化历史和形成方式。作者建议需要一个修订的形态图来更好地理解星系演化过程。 <div>
Using “spatially” resolved spectroscopy, we investigated the characteristics and different modes of formation of stars in elliptical galaxies. We identified an unusual population of 59 star-forming elliptical (SF-E) galaxies in SDSS-MaNGA, our primary sample. To identify these rare star-forming ellipticals, we combined GSWLC-A2 containing outputs of stellar population synthesis models with morphological results from the deep-learning catalog and resolved and integrated properties from the MaNGA Pipe3D value-added catalog. We have also constructed two control samples of star-forming spirals (SF-Sps; 2419 galaxies) and quenched ellipticals (Q-Es; 684 galaxies) to compare with our primary sample of SF-Es. Hα emission line flux of SF-Es is similar to spiral galaxies. The D4000 spectral index indicates that SF-Es have a mixture of old and young stellar populations. Mass-weighted stellar age and metallicity for the SF-Es are lower than the Q-Es and 67% of stellar- and gas-velocity maps of the primary sample show signs of kinematic disturbance. All of these indicate that SF-Es have acquired metal-poor gas through recent mergers or interactions with other galaxies and are forming a new generation of stars. Further, we subdivide our primary sample of SF-Es into four classes based on their bulge to total luminosity ratio (B/T) and spin parameter . These four classes have their distinct evolutionary history and modes of formation. Based on these results, we suggest that the Hubble diagram does not accurately capture galaxy evolution processes, and we need a revised morphology diagram like the comb morphology diagram to get a complete picture of the galaxy evolution processes.

<div> 关键词: H2O ices, 近红外光谱, 空间冰, 光谱特征, 仪器曝光时间
总结: <br /><br />这项研究利用实验室得到的纯非晶和晶态冰的近红外光谱，在80-180K温度范围内进行了研究。研究的目的是提供光谱参考数据，以便远程访问冰的性质，如冰卫星、彗星冰或土星环等冰的物质特性。研究特别识别了评估空间冰三个重要属性的新的光谱标记：(i) 孔隙度/蓬松度，(ii) 非晶冰的体密度，(iii) 结晶冰的立方性。研究分析了OH-伸展泛频（2νOH）和5000cm^{-1}/2μm的组合带，这些是这些属性的有力光谱标记。通过比较蒸发沉积的微孔非晶固态水、无孔低、高和非常高密度非晶冰的光谱，能够在非晶冰的近红外光谱中将(体)密度效应与孔隙度效应分离开来。这一点澄清了一直存在的问题，即詹尼斯肯斯和布莱克首次提出的低温蒸发沉积的非晶冰密度不一致问题。通过将近红外光谱与粉末X射线衍射图进行直接比较，可以将光谱特征与堆叠失序冰Isd中的立方叠层数相关联，范围从完全立方冰Ic到完全六角冰Ih。研究还表明，詹姆斯·韦伯空间望远镜上的仪器曝光时间在小时范围内可区分这些属性，证明了被忽视的近红外光谱范围对于识别空间中的冰是有用的。 <div>
We present laboratory spectra of pure amorphous and crystalline H2O ices in the near-infrared (NIR, 1–2.5 μm/10,000–4000 cm−1) at 80–180 K. The aim of this study is to provide spectroscopic reference data that allow remotely accessing ice properties for icy objects such as icy moons, cometary ice, or Saturn rings. Specifically, we identify new spectral markers for assessing three important properties of ices in space: (i) porosity/fluffiness, (ii) bulk density of amorphous ice, and (iii) cubicity in crystalline ice. The analysis is based on the first OH-stretching overtone (2νOH) and the combinational band at 5000 cm−1/2 μm, which are potent spectral markers for these properties. By comparison of vapor-deposited, microporous amorphous solid water, pore-free low-, high-, and very-high-density amorphous ice, we are able to separate the effect of (bulk) density from the effect of porosity on NIR-spectra of amorphous ices. This allows for clarifying a longstanding inconsistency about the density of amorphous ice vapor-deposited at low temperatures, first brought up by Jenniskens & Blake. Direct comparison of NIR spectra with powder X-ray diffractograms allows us to correlate spectral features with the number of cubic stacking layers in stacking-disordered ice Isd, ranging from fully cubic ice Ic to fully hexagonal ice Ih. We show that exposure times for instruments on the James Webb Space Telescope are in the hour range to distinguish these properties, demonstrating the usefulness of the neglected NIR spectral range for identifying ices in space.

<div> 关键词: UV continuum slope, infrared excess, high-redshift galaxies, dust attenuation law, SED modeling

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了通过观测的UV连续斜率（β）和红外过剩（IRX）之间的关系，来理解高红移星系的尘埃衰减规律。研究使用了来自AstroSat UV Deep Field北部的83个UV选择的星系数据，估算了52个星系的观测IRX。通过多波段光度数据进行SED建模，发现IRX-β值存在较大散布，表明尘埃衰减存在多样性。研究发现在IRX-β平面上最佳拟合的修正Calzetti关系的幂律斜率（δ）存在明显关联，SMC类似的更陡的衰减规律更偏好较低的δ值。SED模型的IRX-β关系显示偏好于更陡的SMC类似的衰减规律，这与用Hα发射线推导的星形成率和观测的远紫外加重处理的远红外辐射得出的结果吻合。这项研究揭示了IRX和星系的恒星质量之间的强正相关，表明更大质量的星系会产生更多的尘埃。 <div>
The relation between the observed UV continuum slope (β) and the infrared excess (IRX) is used as a powerful probe to understand the nature of dust attenuation law in high-redshift galaxies. We present a study of 83 UV-selected galaxies between a redshift of 0.5 and 0.7 from the AstroSat UV Deep Field north that encloses the GOODS-North field. Using empirical relation, we estimate the observed IRX of 52 galaxies that are detected in either one or both of the Herschel PACS 100 and 160 μm bands. We further utilize the multiband photometric data in 14–18 filters from the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope, KPNO, Hubble Space Telescope, Spitzer, and Herschel telescopes to perform spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling. Both the observed and model-derived IRX–β values show a large scatter within the span of previously known relations, signifying diversity in dust attenuation. We found a distinct relation between the best-fit power-law slope of the modified Calzetti relation (δ) in the IRX–β plane, where the steeper SMC-like attenuation law prefers lower δ values. Our SED model-based IRX–β relation shows a preference for steeper SMC-like attenuation, which we further confirm from the agreement between extinction-corrected star formation rates derived using the Hα emission line and the observed far-ultraviolet plus reprocessed far-IR fluxes. The current study reveals a strong positive correlation between IRX and the galaxy's stellar mass between 109.5 and 1011.0M⊙, signifying increased dust production in more massive star-forming galaxies.

<div> Parker Solar Probe, solar encounter, magnetic structure, heliospheric current sheet, streamer blobs
总结:
Parker Solar Probe于2019年3月30日至4月11日期间进行了第二次太阳遭遇，期间观测到了大量大小不一的流量增强体（流星团）在赤道附近流动。WISPR的高分辨率和灵敏度揭示了这些增强体的结构，显示出其中一些流星团具有暗色中心核心，暗示其为磁通绳。通过对四个典型流星团的3D轨迹和大小进行跟踪，确认它们的位置与太阳赤道帽相关联。这些流星团在15 R☉以上的区域被观测到，证实了在HCS附近的慢风中重新连接的过程主导着慢风的形成。 <br /><br /> <div>
Parker Solar Probe's second solar encounter from 2019 March 30 to April 11 occurred during a period when the corona had a simple magnetic structure and relatively flat heliospheric current sheet (HCS), which was in the field of view of the Wide-field Imager for Solar Probe (WISPR) throughout. The images show an almost continual flow of transient density enhancements (streamer blobs) of various sizes near the latitude of the HCS during the entire 11 day encounter period. The high resolution and sensitivity of WISPR reveal the structure of some of the individual blobs not seen in observations from 1 au. Many of the blobs show dark central cores, suggesting that they are magnetic flux ropes. The 3D trajectories and sizes of four representative streamer blobs have been determined using the tracking and fitting technique of Liewer et al. (2020). Comparison of the location of these blobs with synoptic white-light maps for this time period, created using data from the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (Brueckner et al. 1995) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, confirms that the blobs are at the location of the helmet streamer associated with the HCS. The blobs were observed in the region beyond 15 R☉. The continual flow of blobs, the confirmation of their location at the HCS, and their flux-rope-like appearance provide strong evidence that the process of reconnection across the current sheet dominates the slow wind near the HCS.

总结:
本文报道了来自南天MWA Rapid Two-meter脉冲星调查的长周期脉冲星PSR J0452−3418的发现。该脉冲星表现出准周期性的闪烁和亚脉冲漂移。文章描述了脉冲星的发现和后续跟踪，包括使用uGMRT进行高分辨率成像的位置测定，使用MWA和uGMRT数据进行初步定时分析，以及在MWA频段（140–170 MHz）内对闪烁和漂移特性的详细表征。研究发现，该脉冲星的闪烁分数为34% ± 6%，闪烁周期为脉冲。此外，文章还对比了观察到的特性与其他表现出亚脉冲漂移和准周期性闪烁现象的脉冲星的特征，并发现大多数这类对象倾向于处于“死亡谷”中。研究还讨论了脉冲星发射物理学的广泛含义以及使用下一代脉冲星调查方法检测类似对象的可行性。 <div>
The phenomenon of pulsar nulling, where pulsars temporarily and stochastically cease their radio emission, is thought to be indicative of a “dying” pulsar, where radio emission ceases entirely. Here we report the discovery of a long-period pulsar, PSR J0452−3418, from the ongoing Southern-sky MWA Rapid Two-meter pulsar survey. The pulsar has a rotation period of ∼1.67 s and a dispersion measure of 19.8 pc cm−3, and it exhibits both quasiperiodic nulling and subpulse drifting. Periodic nulling is uncommon, reported in only <1% of the pulsar population, with even a smaller fraction showing periodic nulling and subpulse drifting. We describe the discovery and follow-up of the pulsar, including a positional determination using high-resolution imaging with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), initial timing analysis using the combination of Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and uGMRT data, and detailed characterization of the nulling and drifting properties in the MWA’s frequency band (140–170 MHz). Our analysis suggests a nulling fraction of 34% ± 6% and a nulling periodicity of pulses. We measure the phase (P2) and time modulation (P3) caused by the subpulse drifting, with an average P2 of 7.1 degrees and a P3 of 4.8 pulses. We compare and contrast the observed properties with those of other pulsars that exhibit subpulse drifting and quasiperiodic nulling phenomena, and find that the majority of these objects tend to be in the “death valley” in the period–period derivative (P– ) diagram. We also discuss some broader implications for pulsar emission physics and the detectability of similar objects using next-generation pulsar surveys.

总结:
脉冲非定期脉动（QPPs）在2024年2月22日（SOL2024-02-22T22:08）的X6.4耀斑的冲击阶段同时在硬X射线（HXR）、微波、Lyα和紫外线（UV）发射波长中观测到。X6.4耀斑在HXR和微波波段显示出三次重复和连续的脉动，并且具有极大的调制深度。耀斑QPPs的发生几乎与正负磁场的磁消除的开始几乎同时发生。小波功率谱表明存在两个中心在∼200和∼95秒左右的双周期。在耀斑区域还可以在Lyα和UV波段检测到长周期QPP，并且它可以在相邻的太阳黑子中观察到。我们的观测表明，耀斑QPPs很可能是由与周期性磁重连接相关的加速电子触发的。∼200秒的长周期可能受到来自邻近太阳黑子的慢磁声波的调制，而∼95秒的短周期可以被视为它的第二谐波模式。 <div>
We report the simultaneous observations of quasiperiodic pulsations (QPPs) in wavelengths of hard X-ray (HXR), microwave, Lyα, and ultraviolet (UV) emissions during the impulsive phase of an X6.4 flare on 2024 February 22 (SOL2024-02-22T22:08). The X6.4 flare shows three repetitive and successive pulsations in HXR and microwave wavebands, and they have an extremely large modulation depth. The onset of flare QPPs is almost simultaneous with the start of magnetic cancellation between positive and negative fields. The wavelet power spectra suggest the presence of double periods, which are centered at ∼200 and ∼95 s, respectively. The long-period QPP can also be detected in Lyα and UV wavebands at the flare area, and it could be observed in the adjacent sunspot. Our observations indicate that the flare QPPs are most likely triggered by accelerated electrons that are associated with periodic magnetic reconnections. The long period at ∼200 s is probably modulated by the slow magnetoacoustic wave originating from the neighboring sunspot, while the short period at ∼95 s could be regarded as its second harmonic mode.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The multiscaled solar magnetic field consists of two major components: active regions (ARs) and magnetic network. Unraveling the cycle-dependent properties and interrelations of these components is crucial for understanding the evolution of the solar magnetic field. In this study, we investigate these components using magnetic power spectra derived from high-resolution and continuous synoptic magnetograms since cycle 23 onward. Our results show that the size of the magnetic network ranges from 26 to 41 Mm without dependence on the solar cycle. The power of the network field (PNW) accounts for approximately 20% of the total power during any phase of solar cycles. In contrast to the AR power (PAR), PNW displays a weaker cycle dependence, as described by the relationship PNW ≈ 0.6* PAR + 40. The power-law index between AR sizes and magnetic network sizes presents a strong anticorrelation with the activity level. Additionally, our study indicates that in the absence of sunspots on the solar disc, the magnetic power spectra remain time-independent, consistently exhibiting similarity in both shape and power. This study introduces a new method to investigate the properties of the magnetic network and provides magnetic power spectra for high-resolution simulations of the solar magnetic field at the surface at various phases of solar cycles.

<div> SNe Ia, Hubble constant, distance calibrators, near-infrared, systematic errors 

总结: 本研究分析了Ia型超新星（SNe Ia）的数据，利用光学到近红外波段（uBgVriYJH）扩展了哈勃图。利用不同的距离校准器（Cepheids、TRGB和SBFs）计算了哈勃常数H0，得到了B波段的H0 = 71.76 ± 0.58（stat）± 1.19（sys）km s−1 Mpc−1和H波段的H0 = 73.22 ± 0.68（stat）± 1.28（sys）km s−1 Mpc−1。通过将Cepheid、TRGB和SBF校准器赋予相等的权重，得出了距离阶梯的第一层的系统误差约为1.2∼1.3 km s−1 Mpc−1，从而减小了我们的结果与宇宙微波背景提供的早期H0之间的张力。研究发现在Y波段有最高的SNe Ia发光精度（0.12 ± 0.01 mag）。另外，确认了SNe Ia的余辉主机质量相关性在光学和近红外波长间基本没有变化。最后，发现距离宿主中心超过10 kpc爆炸的SNe Ia发光分散较小，这可能是由于在主机外围灰尘的影响减小所导致的。 <div>
We present an analysis of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Carnegie Supernova Project I and II and extend the Hubble diagram from optical to near-infrared wavelengths (uBgVriYJH). We calculate the Hubble constant, H0, using various distance calibrators: Cepheids, the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB), and surface brightness fluctuations (SBFs). Combining all methods of calibration, we derive H0 = 71.76 ± 0.58 (stat) ± 1.19 (sys) km s−1 Mpc−1 from the B band and H0 = 73.22 ± 0.68 (stat) ± 1.28 (sys) km s−1 Mpc−1 from the H band. By assigning equal weight to the Cepheid, TRGB, and SBF calibrators, we derive the systematic errors required for consistency in the first rung of the distance ladder, resulting in a systematic error of 1.2 ∼ 1.3 km s−1 Mpc−1 in H0. As a result, relative to the statistics-only uncertainty, the tension between the late-time H0 we derive by combining the various distance calibrators and the early-time H0 from the cosmic microwave background is reduced. The highest precision in SN Ia luminosity is found in the Y band (0.12 ± 0.01 mag), as defined by the intrinsic scatter (σint). We revisit SN Ia Hubble residual-host mass correlations and recover previous results that these correlations do not change significantly between the optical and near-infrared wavelengths. Finally, SNe Ia that explode beyond 10 kpc from their host centers exhibit smaller dispersion in their luminosity, confirming our earlier findings. A reduced effect of dust in the outskirts of hosts may be responsible for this effect.

本研究利用表面亮度波动来间接探测星系团介质中的湍流特性，包括湍流速度、注入尺度以及波动功率谱向较小尺度的倾斜。通过南极望远镜对SZ星系团的研究，结合X射线观测，选取了两个典型星系团进行了初步研究。研究结果显示，两个星系团中涡流的注入尺度都超过500千秒差距，其中SPT-CLJ0232-4421的马赫数约为0.5，SPT-CLJ0638-5358的马赫数约为0.6-1.6，并且后者有已知的激波。此外，对于M500，SPT-CLJ0232-4421的静压偏差值小于0.2，而SPT-CLJ0638-5358的静压偏差值小于0.1。这些结果表明，通过多波段的详细观测方法来定量评估数据的重要性，同时也暗示了湍流驱动可能出现在相当大的尺度上。 <br /><br /> <div>
Studies of surface brightness fluctuations in the intracluster medium present an indirect probe of turbulent properties such as the turbulent velocities, injection scales, and the slope of the power spectrum of fluctuations toward smaller scales. With the advancement of Sunyaev–Zel’dovich (SZ) studies and surveys relative to X-ray observations, we seek to investigate surface brightness fluctuations in a sample of South Pole Telescope (SPT)-SZ clusters which also have archival XMM-Newton data. Here we present a pilot study of two typical clusters in that sample: SPT-CLJ0232-4421 and SPT-CLJ0638-5358. We infer injection scales larger than 500 kpc in both clusters and Mach numbers ≈ 0.5 in SPT-CLJ0232-4421 and Mach numbers ≈ 0.6–1.6 in SPT-CLJ0638-5358, which has a known shock. We find hydrostatic bias values for M500 less than 0.2 for SPT-CLJ0232-4421 and less than 0.1 for SPT-CLJ0638-5358. These results show the importance to assess quantitative values via a detailed multiwavelength approach and suggest that the drivers of turbulence may occur at quite large scales.

这项研究使用Keck行星成像仪和特性分析仪进行了高分辨率光谱观测，对八个质量约为10-30倍木星质量、轨道分离约50-360天文单位、有效温度约在1500-2600K之间的年轻次恒星伴星进行了统一的大气检索。研究发现所有伴星的碳氧比率和金属丰度均接近太阳值，且与太阳系中恒星的大气成分相似。这表示这些伴星的形成可能与直接的重力坍缩过程相关。与m < 10倍木星质量的直接成像行星大气金属丰度略有不同。另外，我们还对三个信噪比最高的伴星进行了12CO/13CO比值的限制，对所有伴星进行了径向速度的测量。具体模型预测，尤其是针对Teff约在1700-2000K的伴星κ And b和GSC 6214-210 b，偏好于有云模型，这与热木星的大气成分有所不同。<br /><br />总结: 该研究使用Keck行星成像仪和特性分析仪进行了高分辨率光谱观测，发现年轻次恒星伴星的大气成分与太阳系中的恒星相似，可能与直接的重力坍缩过程相关。与小质量直接成像行星的大气金属丰度略有不同，同时也与热木星的大气成分有所不同。 <div>
Using Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer high-resolution (R ∼ 35,000) spectroscopy from 2.29 to 2.49 μm, we present uniform atmospheric retrievals for eight young substellar companions with masses of ∼10–30 MJup, orbital separations spanning ∼50–360 au, and Teff between ∼1500 and 2600 K. We find that all companions have solar C/O ratios and metallicities to within the 1σ–2σ level, with the measurements clustered around solar composition. Stars in the same stellar associations as our systems have near-solar abundances, so these results indicate that this population of companions is consistent with formation via direct gravitational collapse. Alternatively, core accretion outside the CO snowline would be compatible with our measurements, though the high mass ratios of most systems would require rapid core assembly and gas accretion in massive disks. On a population level, our findings can be contrasted with abundance measurements for directly imaged planets with m < 10 MJup, which show tentative atmospheric metal enrichment compared to their host stars. In addition, the atmospheric compositions of our sample of companions are distinct from those of hot Jupiters, which most likely form via core accretion. For two companions with Teff ∼ 1700–2000 K (κ And b and GSC 6214–210 b), our best-fit models prefer a nongray cloud model with >3σ significance. The cloudy models yield 2σ−3σ lower Teff for these companions, though the C/O and [C/H] still agree between cloudy and clear models at the 1σ level. Finally, we constrain 12CO/13CO for three companions with the highest signal-to-noise ratio data (GQ Lup b, HIP 79098b, and DH Tau b) and report and radial velocities for all companions.

总结:<br />
本文使用了高分辨率的宇宙学模拟来研究恒星晕的性质和组成成分，模拟结果表明FOGGIE模拟的恒星晕质量、金属丰度梯度和表面亮度分布与观测一致。恒星晕中有30%-40%的质量来源于原位恒星，这部分恒星更为集中在中心区域，不会使恒星晕外围过亮。剩下的恒星主要来自于10-50个其他星系，其中大部分来自于2-4个星系。预计未来的宽景天文台，如南希·格雷斯·罗曼太空望远镜，将能够观测到银河系附近的恒星晕，甚至可以通过色-星等图来区分矮星系的残骸与恒星晕的区别。 <div>
Over the next decade, the astronomical community will be commissioning multiple wide-field observatories well suited for studying stellar halos in both integrated light and resolved stars. In preparation for this, we use five high-resolution cosmological simulations of Milky Way–like galaxies from the FOGGIE suite to explore the properties and components of stellar halos. These simulations are run with high time (5 Myr) and stellar mass (1000 M⊙) resolution to better model the properties and origins of low-density regions like stellar halos. We find that the FOGGIE stellar halos have masses, metallicity gradients, and surface brightness profiles that are consistent with observations. In agreement with other simulations, the FOGGIE stellar halos receive 30%–40% of their mass from in situ stars. However, this population is more centrally concentrated in the FOGGIE simulations and therefore does not contribute excess light to the halo outskirts. The remaining stars are accreted from ∼10–50 other galaxies, with the majority of the accreted mass originating in two to four galaxies. While the inner halo (r < 50 kpc) of each FOGGIE galaxy has a large number of contributors, the halo outskirts of three of the five galaxies are primarily made up of stars from only a few contributors. We predict that upcoming wide-field observatories, like the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, will probe stellar halos around Milky Way–like galaxies out to ∼100 kpc in integrated light and will be able to distinguish the debris of dwarf galaxies with extended star formation histories from the underlying halo with resolved color–magnitude diagrams.

<div> 关键词: massive quiescent galaxies, z ≥ 3, JWST NIRCam imaging data, color selection technique, SED fitting

总结:
本研究提出了一种新的经验性颜色选择技术，旨在利用JWST NIRCam成像数据在3≤z≤6的范围内选择大质量寂静星系。通过使用经验约束的星系光谱能量分布（SED）模板，确定了F277W-F444W与F150W-F277W色彩平面上的一个区域，捕捉了z>3的寂静星系。在CEERS调查中应用这些颜色选择标准，并对该区域内的源进行SED拟合，鉴定出了44个z≳3的寂静星系候选体。其中超过一半的源是新发现的，平均具有后爆发星系的特定星形成率。大多数这些源在传统UVJ图中是无法发现的。我们估算出3<5时的体密度为n∼1-4×10^-5 Mpc^-3，与CEERS领域类似群体的现有报告非常一致。借助NIRCam的波长覆盖范围和灵敏度，这种技术提供了一种高效的工具，可以搜索到大量这种罕见的星系。 <div>
Substantial populations of massive quiescent galaxies at z ≥ 3 challenge our understanding of rapid galaxy growth and quenching over short timescales. In order to piece together this evolutionary puzzle, more statistical samples of these objects are required. Established techniques for identifying massive quiescent galaxies are increasingly inefficient and unconstrained at z > 3. As a result, studies report that as much as 70% of quiescent galaxies at z > 3 may be missed from existing surveys. In this work, we propose a new empirical color selection technique designed to select massive quiescent galaxies at 3 ≲ z ≲ 6 using JWST NIRCam imaging data. We use empirically constrained galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) templates to define a region in the F277W − F444W versus F150W − F277W color plane that captures quiescent galaxies at z > 3. We apply these color selection criteria to the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey and use SED fitting on sources in the region to identify 44 candidate z ≳ 3 quiescent galaxies. Over half of these sources are newly discovered and, on average, exhibit specific star formation rates of poststarburst galaxies. Most of these sources would not be discovered using canonical UVJ diagrams. We derive volume density estimates of n ∼ 1–4 × 10−5 Mpc−3 at 3 < z < 5, finding excellent agreement with existing reports on similar populations in the CEERS field. Thanks to NIRCam’s wavelength coverage and sensitivity, this technique provides an efficient tool to search for large samples of these rare galaxies.

<div> 关键词: gamma-ray bursts, spectral analysis, outflow properties, Amati relation, Yonetoku relation
总结: 
gamma-ray bursts 研究者对21个Fermi GRBs进行了系统的分析，发现几乎所有的precursors和主爆发都表现出热组分，并且它们的能谱指数存在相关演化。此外，他们也发现大部分的情况下precursors和主爆发有着类似的发射特性和光谱特征，并且它们在Amati关系和Yonetoku关系中处于相似的分布区域。因此，研究结论认为主爆发是precursors的延续，可能有着共同的物理起源。 <div>
There is no consensus yet on whether the precursor and the main burst of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have the same origin, and their jet composition is still unclear. In order to further investigate this issue, we systematically search 21 Fermi GRBs with both a precursor and main burst for spectral analysis. We first perform Bayesian time-resolved spectral analysis and find that almost all the precursors and the main bursts (94.4%) exhibit thermal components and that the vast majority of them have a low-energy spectral index (α; 72.2%) that exceeds the limit of synchrotron radiation. We then analyze the evolution and correlation of the spectral parameters and find that approximately half of the α (50%) of the precursors and the main bursts evolve in a similar pattern, while peak energy (Ep; 55.6%) behaves similarly, and their evolution is mainly characterized by flux tracking; for the α−F (the flux) relation, more than half of the precursors and the main bursts (61.1%) exhibit roughly similar patterns; the Ep−F relation in both the precursor and main burst (100%) exhibits a positive correlation of at least moderate strength. Next, we constrain the outflow properties of the precursors and the main bursts and find that most of them exhibit typical properties of photosphere radiation. Finally, we compare the time-integrated spectra of the precursors and the main bursts and find that nearly all of them are located in similar regions of the Amati relation and follow the Yonetoku relation. Therefore, we conclude that main bursts are continuations of precursors and may share a common physical origin.

总结: <br /><br />这篇文章主要介绍了太阳大气中的磁场几何以及投影效应对波的传播路径进行精确映射的困难。研究人员利用Dunn太阳望远镜的干涉双向光谱仪，对一个太阳黑子进行了高分辨率的Hα光谱扫描，并对一个突出的超边暗纤维的横向振荡进行了深入研究。他们发现这个纤维在椭圆偏振下进行传播的扭曲振荡，振荡周期为430秒，相速度为69±4 km/s。随着振荡传播离开太阳黑子，能量逐渐耗散，导致能量流量呈现约460 W m-2/Mm的速率减小。另外，研究还发现Hα线宽随着距离太阳黑子的增加而增加，可能是温度的迹象。虽然研究了不同线性和非线性机制对波能量流的耗散，但它们的简单叠加效果无法解释观察到的耗散长度。研究人员预计，本文展示的重投影方法将有助于未来对纤维结构中横向波的研究。 <div>
The magnetic geometry of the solar atmosphere, combined with projection effects, makes it difficult to accurately map the propagation of ubiquitous waves in fibrillar structures. These waves are of interest due to their ability to carry energy into the chromosphere and deposit it through damping and dissipation mechanisms. To this end, the Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer at the Dunn Solar Telescope was employed to capture high-resolution Hα spectral scans of a sunspot, with the transverse oscillations of a prominent superpenumbral fibril examined in depth. The oscillations are reprojected from the helioprojective Cartesian frame to a new frame of reference oriented along the average fibril axis through nonlinear force-free field extrapolations. The fibril was found to be carrying an elliptically polarized, propagating kink oscillation with a period of 430 s and a phase velocity of 69 ± 4 km s−1. The oscillation is damped as it propagates away from the sunspot with a damping length of approximately 9.2 Mm, resulting in the energy flux decreasing at a rate on the order of 460 W m−2/Mm. The Hα line width is examined and found to increase with distance from the sunspot, a potential sign of a temperature increase. Different linear and nonlinear mechanisms are investigated for the damping of the wave energy flux, but a first-order approximation of their combined effects is insufficient to recreate the observed damping length by a factor of at least 3. It is anticipated that the reprojection methodology demonstrated in this study will aid with future studies of transverse waves within fibrillar structures.

总结:<br />
NGC 777是一个椭圆星系核的研究对象，其温度分布与辐射天体活动关联紧密。通过深度的Chandra X射线观测和uGMRT 400 MHz的射电成像，研究发现其核区存在热核现象，同时发现周围存在微弱的射电辐射。通过观测结果推测，该热核可能是由于活动星系核喷流作用或者来自老的射电喷流残留的粒子加热导致。同时，通过X射线亮度的减小，可以说明可能存在喷流在10-20kpc范围内的扩展，此喷流可能已经持续至少240百万年，可以平衡辐射冷却效应。 <div>
NGC 777 provides an example of a phenomenon observed in some group-central ellipticals, in which the temperature profile shows a central peak, despite the short central cooling time of the intragroup medium. We use deep Chandra X-ray observations of the galaxy, supported by uGMRT 400 MHz radio imaging, to investigate the origin of this hot core. We confirm the centrally peaked temperature profile and find that the entropy and cooling time both monotonically decline to low values (2.62 keV cm2 and Myr, respectively) in the central ∼700 pc. Faint diffuse radio emission surrounds the nuclear point source, with no clear jets or lobes but extending to ∼10 kpc on the northwest–southeast axis. This alignment and extent agree well with a previously identified filamentary Hα + [N ii] nebula. While cavities are not firmly detected, we see X-ray surface brightness decrements on the same axis at 10–20 kpc radii, which are consistent with the intragroup medium having been pushed aside by expanding radio lobes. Any such outburst must have occurred long enough ago for lobe emission to have faded below detectability. Cavities on this scale would be capable of balancing radiative cooling for at least ∼240 Myr. We consider possible causes of the centrally peaked temperature profile, including gravitational heating of gas as the halo relaxes after a period of active galactic nucleus jet activity, and heating by particles leaking from the remnant relativistic plasma of the old radio jets.

Recent James Webb Space Telescope data analyses have shown that massive red galaxies existed at redshifts z ≳ 6, a discovery that is difficult to understand in the context of standard cosmology (ΛCDM). Here, we analyze these observations more deeply, by fitting a stellar population model to the optical and near-infrared photometric data. These fits include a main stellar population in addition to a residual younger population and with the same extinction for both (a lower extinction for the younger population is unphysical). Extra stellar populations or the inclusion of an active galactic nucleus component do not significantly improve the fits. These galaxies are being viewed at very high redshifts, with an average 〈z〉 ≈ 8.2, when the ΛCDM Universe was only ≈600 Myr old. This result conflicts with the inferred ages of these galaxies, however, which were on average between 0.9 and 2.4 Gyr old within a 95% confidence level. Given the sequence of star formation and galaxy assembly in the standard model, these galaxies should instead be even younger than 290 Myr on average, for which our analysis assigns a probability of only <3 × 10−4 (≳3.6σ tension). This outcome may indicate the need to consider nonstandard cosmologies. Nevertheless, our conclusions result from several approximations in stellar astrophysics and extinction, so they should be taken with a grain of salt. Further research is necessary to corroborate the possible existence of galaxies older than the ΛCDM Universe at their observed redshifts.

Planetary-mass objects and brown dwarfs at the transition (Teff ∼ 1300 K) from relatively red L dwarfs to bluer mid-T dwarfs show enhanced spectrophotometric variability. Multiepoch observations support atmospheric planetary-scale (Kelvin or Rossby) waves as the primary source of this variability; however, large spots associated with the precipitation of silicate and metal clouds have also been theorized and suggested by Doppler imaging. We applied both wave and spotted models to fit near-infrared (NIR), multiband (Y/J/H/K) photometry of SIMP J013656.5+093347 (hereafter SIMP0136) collected at the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope using the Wide-field InfraRed Camera. SIMP0136 is a planetary-mass object (12.7 ± 1.0 MJ) at the L/T transition (T2 ± 0.5) known to exhibit light-curve evolution over multiple rotational periods. We measure the maximum peak-to-peak variability of 6.17% ± 0.46%, 6.45% ± 0.33%, 6.51% ± 0.42%, and 4.33% ± 0.38% in the Y, J, H, and K bands, respectively, and find evidence that wave models are preferred for all four NIR bands. Furthermore, we determine that the spot size necessary to reproduce the observed variations is larger than the Rossby deformation radius and Rhines scale, which is unphysical. Through the correlation between light curves produced by the waves and associated color variability, we find evidence of planetary-scale, wave-induced cloud modulation and breakup, similar to Jupiter’s atmosphere and supported by general circulation models. We also detect a 93.°8 ± 7.°4 (12.7σ) phase shift between the H − K and J − H color time series, providing evidence for complex vertical cloud structure in SIMP0136's atmosphere.

<div> 关键词: UV-derived star formation rates, 7.7 μm polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon luminosities, SED modeling, JWST/MIRI, galaxies at z ∼ 0–2

总结:
本研究测试了恒星形成率（SFRs）与7.7微米多环芳烃发光在z∼0–2星系中的关系。通过利用来自哈勃太空望远镜、CFHT、JWST、Spitzer和Herschel的多波段光度测量数据，对CEERS调查中的星系进行了谱能分布（SED）建模。研究测量了经过尘埃校正的远紫外线（FUV）光度LFUV和UV导出的SFR。然后使用JWST/MIRI 7.7-21微米数据对SED模型进行拟合，得到了其余波段7.7微米光度L770。研究发现L770与LFUV之间存在相关性。对于低金属含量、较低尘埃遮挡和受到演化恒星群体主导的星系，L770与这一关系有所偏离。研究得出了L770的“单波长”SFR校准，其与模型估计的SFRs的离散度（σΔSFR）为0.24 dex。此外，还得出了FUV光度（未经尘埃校正）和余波段7.7微米光度的线性组合的“多波段”校准，其离散度σΔSFR = 0.21 dex。这些结果表明，JWST/MIRI约束的余波段7.7微米发射对于远处星系的SFR是一个可靠的追踪器，其精度为0.21-0.24 dex，前提是星系以中等到高水平的遮挡和金属含量主导星形成。 <div>
We test the relationship between UV-derived star formation rates (SFRs) and the 7.7 μm polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon luminosities from the integrated emission of galaxies at z ∼ 0–2. We utilize multiband photometry covering 0.2–160 μm from the Hubble Space Telescope, CFHT, JWST, Spitzer, and Herschel for galaxies in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey. We perform spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling of these data to measure dust-corrected far-UV (FUV) luminosities, LFUV, and UV-derived SFRs. We then fit SED models to the JWST/MIRI 7.7–21 μm CEERS data to derive rest-frame 7.7 μm luminosities, L770, using the average flux density in the rest-frame MIRI F770W bandpass. We observe a correlation between L770 and LFUV, where . L770 diverges from this relation for galaxies at lower metallicities, lower dust obscuration, and for galaxies dominated by evolved stellar populations. We derive a “single-wavelength” SFR calibration for L770 that has a scatter from model estimated SFRs (σΔSFR) of 0.24 dex. We derive a “multiwavelength” calibration for the linear combination of the observed FUV luminosity (uncorrected for dust) and the rest-frame 7.7 μm luminosity, which has a scatter of σΔSFR = 0.21 dex. The relatively small decrease in σ suggests this is near the systematic accuracy of the total SFRs using either calibration. These results demonstrate that the rest-frame 7.7 μm emission constrained by JWST/MIRI is a tracer of the SFR for distant galaxies to this accuracy, provided the galaxies are dominated by star formation with moderate-to-high levels of attenuation and metallicity.

We report on discovery of a concentration of massive quiescent galaxies located at z = 4. The concentration is first identified using high-quality photometric redshifts based on deep, multiband data in Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Field. Follow-up near-infrared spectroscopic observations with MOSFIRE on Keck confirm a massive (∼1011M⊙) quiescent galaxy at z = 3.99. Our spectral energy distribution analyses reveal that the galaxy experienced an episode of starburst about 500 Myr prior to the observed epoch, followed by rapid quenching. Since its spectrum is sufficiently good to measure the stellar velocity dispersion, we infer its dynamical mass and find that it is consistent with its stellar mass. The galaxy is surrounded by four massive (>1010M⊙) quiescent galaxies on a ∼1 physical Mpc scale, all of which are consistent with being located at the same redshift based on high-accuracy spectrophotometric redshifts. This is likely a (proto)cluster dominated by quiescent galaxies, the first of the kind reported at such a high redshift as z = 4. Interestingly, it is in a large-scale structure revealed by spectroscopic redshifts from VANDELS. Furthermore, it also exhibits a red sequence, adding further support to the physical concentration of the galaxies. We find no such concentration in the Illustris-TNG300 simulation; it may be that the cluster is such a rare system that the simulation box is not sufficiently large to reproduce it. The total halo mass of the quiescent galaxies is ∼1013M⊙, suggesting that they form a group-sized halo once they collapse together. We discuss the implications of our findings for the quenching physics and conclude with future prospects.

<title>Modeling the Propagation of Slow Magnetoacoustic Waves in a Multistranded Coronal Loop</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the propagation properties of slow magnetoacoustic waves in a multithermal coronal loop using a 3D MHD model, for the first time. A bundle of 33 vertical cylinders, each of 100 km radius, randomly distributed over a circular region of radius 1 Mm, is considered to represent the coronal loop. The slow waves are driven by perturbing the vertical velocity (vz) at the base of the loop. We apply forward modeling to the simulation results to generate synthetic images in the coronal channels of the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly. Furthermore, we add appropriate data noise to enable direct comparison with the real observations. It is found that the synthetic images at the instrument resolution show noncospatial features in different temperature channels in agreement with previous observations. Time–distance maps are constructed from the synthetic data to study the propagation properties. The results indicate that the oscillations are only visible in specific channels, depending on the temperature range of the plasma existing within the loop. Additionally, the propagation speed of slow waves is also found to be sensitive to the available temperature range. Overall, we propose that the cross-field thermal properties of coronal structures can be inferred using a combination of numerical simulations and observations of slow magnetoacoustic waves.

<div> UV Ceti, radio spectrum, magnetic field, nonthermal particle acceleration, dynamo processes
总结:
UV Ceti是一个近邻（2.7 pc）的双星系统，其大规模磁场导致其与BL Ceti有非常不同的磁活动特征。文章通过对UV Ceti的射电频谱进行多时期的观测，并展示了类似太阳冕层活动的耀斑辐射、类似行星磁层的极光辐射，以及缓慢变化的持续辐射。射电观测是探究UV Ceti大规模磁场在非热粒子加速中的作用的有效手段。观测结果显示所有波段均存在时间变化，并且在40 GHz以下存在循环偏振度的旋转调制迹象。持续辐射在1到105 GHz范围内基本稳定，排除了来自各向同性螺旋角分布的电子的光厚辐射或光薄吉罗同步辐射机制。文章讨论了类似于木星辐射带的辐射机制可能性。 <div>
BL and UV Ceti are a nearby (2.7 pc) binary system with similar masses, spectral types, and rapid rotation rates, but very different magnetic activity. UV Ceti’s much stronger large-scale magnetic field may cause this difference, highlighting key unanswered questions about dynamo processes in fully convective objects. Here, we present multiepoch characterization of the radio spectrum of UV Ceti spanning 1–105 GHz, exhibiting flared emission similar to coronal activity, auroral-like emission analogous to planetary magnetospheres, and slowly varying persistent emission. Radio observations are a powerful means to probe the role that the large-scale magnetic field of UV Ceti has in nonthermal particle acceleration because radio-frequency phenomena result from both the activity of small-scale field features as well as large-scale auroral current systems. We find temporal variability at all bands observed, and a hint of rotational modulation in the degree of circular polarization up to 40 GHz. The persistent component of the emission is fairly constant from 1 to 105 GHz, making optically thick emission or optically thin gyrosynchrotron from electrons with an isotropic pitch angle distribution unlikely. We discuss the possibility of emission mechanisms analogous to Jupiter’s radiation belts.

该研究对YZ Ret古典新星进行了研究，发现在喷发后77天和115天分别观测到了两个高分辨率的X射线光栅谱。这两个谱中均显示出蓝移速度为-1500 km s-1的发射线，其宽度为500 km s-1。研究结果表明，这两个谱均可以被约70eV的碰撞电离等离子体所描述，并且在两次观测之间减弱了约40倍。此外，谱中还观测到了C+4、C+5和N+5的窄辐射复合连续谱，表明热离子化等离子体与约2eV的冷电子发生相互作用。研究还发现C+4的高n-Rydberg系列异常明亮，可通过连续谱降低来测量电子密度，这与He样N+5的密度诊断结果相吻合。研究认为这些高n能级的高密度是迄今为止在天体物理离子化等离子体中发生带中子氢的最好证据。此外，尽管密度高且通量减少，但令人惊讶的是，在38天后速度和等离子体温度仍然相同，这是持续加热的证据。研究提出这种加热是由于新星喷射物中的反冲冲击产生了一个薄的X射线壳。窄的辐射复合连续谱和带中子氢的反应被归因于与冷气体的直接混合，它们从冲击波前或通过接触不连续面超越了热等离子体。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究对新星YZ Ret进行了X射线谱的观测，发现了碰撞电离等离子体的特征，以及与冷电子和中子氢的互动，揭示了新星喷发后的物理过程。 <div>
The origin of bright X-ray emission lines that appear late in a nova eruption remains largely a puzzle. We present two high-resolution X-ray grating spectra of the classical nova YZ Ret, observed 77 and 115 days post-eruption, using XMM-Newton and Chandra, respectively. Both spectra feature resolved emission lines blueshifted by v = –1500 km s−1 and broadened by σv = 500 km s−1. The two spectra are well described by a collisionally ionized plasma of kT ∼ 70 eV that dimmed by a factor of ∼40 between the two exposures. The spectra also show narrow radiative recombination continua (RRCs) of C+4, C+5, and N+5, indicating the interaction of the hot ionized plasma with cold electrons of kT ∼ 2 eV. The high-n Rydberg series of C+4 is anomalously bright, allowing us to measure the electron density through continuum lowering, which is in agreement with the He-like N+5 density diagnostic of ne = (1.7 ± 0.4) × 1011 cm−3. The high population of these high-n levels constitutes the best evidence to date of charge exchange (CX) with neutral H in an astrophysical ionized plasma. The remarkable fact that the velocity and plasma temperature are the same after 38 days, despite the high density and decreasing flux, is evidence for ongoing heating. We suggest the heating is due to a reverse shock in the nova ejecta, which forms a thin X-ray shell. The narrow RRCs and CX are attributed to direct mixing with cold gas, which overtakes the hot plasma either from the shock front or through the contact discontinuity.

总结: 本文提出了关于脉冲星的电场振荡源自自相干e±对产生的假设，并通过粒子-网格模拟展示了对此过程的电场屏蔽效应。接着，作者通过发展一个简化的时间演化动力学模型来再现e±对产生和电场屏蔽的极限循环行为。该模型考虑了磁层电流的影响、e±的逃逸以及产生率对等离子体密度和能量的动态依赖。最后，通过这一简单的理论模型，作者展示了电场振荡的功率谱在多个极限循环中的平均值与观测到的脉冲星无线电谱是一致的。 <div>
It was recently proposed that the electric field oscillation as a result of self-consistent e± pair production may be the source of coherent radio emission from pulsars. Direct particle-in-cell simulations of this process have shown that the screening of the parallel electric field by this pair cascade manifests as a limit cycle, as the parallel electric field is recurrently induced when pairs produced in the cascade escape from the gap region. In this work, we develop a simplified time-dependent kinetic model of e± pair cascades in pulsar magnetospheres that can reproduce the limit-cycle behavior of pair production and electric field screening. This model includes the effects of a magnetospheric current, the escape of e±, as well as the dynamic dependence of pair production rate on the plasma density and energy. Using this simple theoretical model, we show that the power spectrum of electric field oscillations averaged over many limit cycles is compatible with the observed pulsar radio spectrum.

<br /><br />总结:
太阳耀斑中的丝带前缘是耀斑能量沉积到色球层的初始迹象，具有较长的持续时间。研究表明，在注入非热电子能通量很低的情况下，丝带前缘的特性会持续更长时间。在色球层变得足够炽热和密集时，丝带前缘会转变为常规明亮的丝带。因此，丝带前缘的持续时间是衡量相对较低能通量的高能电子在耀斑能通量较大的轰击之前沉积到色球层的持续时间。 <div>
Solar flare ribbon fronts appear ahead of the bright structures that normally characterize solar flares, and can persist for an extended period of time in spatially localized patches before transitioning to “regular” bright ribbons. They likely represent the initial onset of flare energy deposition into the chromosphere. Chromospheric spectra (e.g., He i 10830 Å and the Mg ii near-UV lines) from ribbon fronts exhibit properties rather different to typical flare behavior. In prior numerical modeling efforts we were unable to reproduce the long lifetime of ribbon fronts. Here we present a series of numerical experiments that are rather simple but which have important implications. We inject a very low flux of nonthermal electrons (F = 5 × 108 erg s−1 cm−2) into the chromosphere for 100 s before ramping up to standard flare energy fluxes (F = 1010−11 erg s−1 cm−2). Synthetic spectra not only sustained their ribbon-front-like properties for significantly longer: in the case of harder nonthermal electron spectra, the ribbon front behavior persisted for the entirety of this weak-heating phase. Lengthening or shortening the duration of the weak-heating phase commensurately lengthened or shortened the ribbon front lifetimes. Ribbon fronts transitioned to regular bright ribbons when the upper chromosphere became sufficiently hot and dense, which happened faster for softer nonthermal electron spectra. Thus, the lifetime of flare ribbon fronts are a direct measure of the duration over which a relatively low flux of high-energy electrons precipitates to the chromosphere prior to the bombardment of a much larger energy flux.

Recent high-resolution and sensitivity Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations have unveiled the carbon isotope ratios (12C/13C) of complex organic molecules (COMs) in a low-mass protostellar source. To understand the 12C/13C ratios of COMs, we investigated the carbon isotope fractionation of COMs from prestellar cores to protostellar cores with a gas-grain chemical network model. We confirmed that the 12C/13C ratios of small molecules are bimodal in the prestellar phase: CO and species formed from CO (e.g., CH3OH) are slightly enriched in 13C compared to the local interstellar medium (by ∼10%), while those from C and C+ are depleted in 13C owing to isotope exchange reactions. COMs are mainly formed on the grain surface and in the hot gas (> 100 K) in the protostellar phase. The 12C/13C ratios of COMs depend on which molecules the COMs are formed from. In our base model, some COMs in the hot gas are depleted in 13C compared to the observations. Thus, we additionally incorporate reactions between gaseous atomic C and H2O ice or CO ice on the grain surface to form H2CO ice or C2O ice, as suggested by recent laboratory studies. The direct C-atom addition reactions open pathways to form 13C-enriched COMs from atomic C and CO ice. We find that these direct C-atom addition reactions mitigate 13C-depletion of COMs, and the model with the direct C-atom addition reactions better reproduces the observations than our base model. We also discuss the impact of the cosmic-ray ionization rate on the 12C/13C ratio of COMs.

Effective temperatures, surface gravities, and iron abundances were derived for 109 stars observed by the K2 mission using equivalent width measurements of Fe i and Fe ii lines. Calculations were carried out in local thermodynamic equilibrium using Kurucz model atmospheres. Stellar masses and radii were derived by combining the stellar parameters with Gaia Data Release 3 parallaxes, V magnitudes, and isochrones. The derived stellar and planetary radii have a median internal precision of 1.8% and 2.3%, respectively. The radius gap near Rplanet ∼ 1.9 R⊕ was detected in this K2 sample. Chromospheric activity was measured from the Ca ii H and K lines using the values of , which were investigated as a function of stellar rotational period (Prot), and we found that chromospheric activity decreases with increasing Prot, although there is a large scatter in (∼0.5) for a given Prot. The activity levels in this sample reveal a paucity of F and G dwarfs with intermediate activity levels (the Vaughan–Preston gap). The effect that stellar activity might have on the derivation of stellar parameters was investigated by including magnetically sensitive Fe i lines in the analysis and we find no significant differences between parameters with and without magnetically sensitive lines, although the more active stars ( ) exhibit a larger scatter in the differences in Teff and [Fe/H].

We present the luminosity functions and stellar mass functions of supernova (SN) host galaxies and test if they differ from the functions of normal field galaxies. We utilize homogeneous samples consisting of 273 SNe Ia (z ≤ 0.3) and 44 core-collapse (CC) SNe (z ≤ 0.1) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey II Supernova Survey and the high-signal-to-noise-ratio photometry of galaxies from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program. SN hosts are classified into star-forming and passive galaxy groups based on the spectral energy distribution fitting. We find that the SN host luminosity functions and stellar mass functions deviate from those of normal field galaxies. Star-forming galaxies dominate the low-mass end of the SN Ia host mass function, while passive galaxies dominate the high-mass end. CC SNe are predominantly hosted by star-forming galaxies. In addition, intermediate-mass hosts produce CC SNe with the highest efficiency, while the efficiency of producing SNe Ia monotonically increases as the hosts become more massive. Furthermore, we derive the pseudo mass normalized SN rates (pSNuM) based on the mass functions. We find that the star-forming component of pSNuMIa is less sensitive to the changes in stellar mass, in comparison with the total rate. The behavior of pSNuMCC suggests that the CC rate is proportional to the star-forming rate.

SMC的小麦哲伦星云在紫外光尘埃消光曲线上显示出很大的变化，范围从银河系类似的曲线到明显更陡的曲线，没有可检测到的2175 Å峰。我们通过32条SMC视线的哈勃空间望远镜和IUE光谱的OB星测量了紫外消光曲线，其中8条曲线先前已经发表。我们发现有16条缺少2175 Å峰的视线，4条有可检测到2175 Å峰的视线，2条具有相当平坦的紫外消光和弱/缺失的2175 Å峰，以及由于SMC尘埃柱的低而不可靠的10条曲线。我们的拓展样本显示，具有2175 Å峰和无2175 Å峰的视线分布于整个SMC，而不限于特定区域。缺少2175 Å峰的16条视线的平均消光曲线与以前基于四条视线的平均值非常相似。我们发现尘埃柱和2175 Å峰的强度之间没有相关性。我们检验了2175 Å峰是否源自负责中红外碳质（多环芳烃）发射特征的尘埃颗粒，发现它们相关，证实了最近在银河系的研究结果。总的来说，紫外消光的斜率随着2175 Å峰和远紫外曲线的非线性增加而增加。最后，紫外斜率与N(H i)/A(V)呈正相关，而2175 Å峰和非线性远紫外曲线的振幅与N(H i)/A(V)呈负相关。

The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) shows a large variation in ultraviolet (UV) dust extinction curves, ranging from Milky Way (MW) like to significantly steeper curves with no detectable 2175 Å bump. This result is based on a sample of only nine sight lines. From Hubble Space Telescope Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and IUE spectra of OB stars, we have measured UV extinction curves along 32 SMC sight lines where eight of these curves were published previously. We find 16 sight lines with steep extinction with no detectable 2175 Å bump, four sight lines with MW-like extinction with a detectable 2175 Å bump, two sight lines with fairly flat UV extinction and weak/absent 2175 Å bumps, and 10 sight lines with unreliable curves due to low SMC dust columns. Our expanded sample shows that the sight lines with and without the 2175 Å bump are located throughout the SMC and not limited to specific regions. The average extinction curve of the 16 bump-less sight lines is very similar to the previous average based on four sight lines. We find no correlation between dust column and the strength of the 2175 Å bump. We test the hypothesis that the 2175 Å bump is due to the same dust grains that are responsible for the mid-infrared carbonaceous (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) emission features and find they are correlated, confirming recent work in the MW. Overall, the slope of the UV extinction increases as the amplitudes of the 2175 Å bump and far-ultraviolet curvature decrease. Finally, the UV slope is correlated with N(H i)/A(V) and the 2175 Å bump and nonlinear far-ultraviolet rise amplitudes are anticorrelated with N(H i)/A(V).

We present the first results from the Web Epoch of Reionization Lyα Survey (WERLS), a spectroscopic survey of Lyα emission using Keck I/MOSFIRE and LRIS. WERLS targets bright (J < 26) galaxy candidates with photometric redshifts of 5.5 ≲ z ≲ 8 selected from pre-JWST imaging embedded in the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) within three JWST deep fields: CEERS, PRIMER, and COSMOS-Web. Here, we report 11 z ∼ 7–8 Lyα emitters (LAEs; three secure and eight tentative candidates) detected in the first five nights of WERLS MOSFIRE data. We estimate our observed LAE yield is ∼13%, which is broadly consistent with expectations assuming some loss from redshift uncertainty, contamination from sky OH lines, and that the Universe is approximately half-ionized at this epoch, whereby observable Lyα emission is unlikely for galaxies embedded in a neutral intergalactic medium. Our targets are selected to be UV-bright, and span a range of absolute UV magnitudes with −23.1 < MUV < −19.8. With two LAEs detected at z = 7.68, we also consider the possibility of an ionized bubble at this redshift. Future synergistic Keck+JWST efforts will provide a powerful tool for pinpointing beacons of reionization and mapping the large-scale distribution of mass relative to the ionization state of the Universe.

总结: <br />
本研究通过对中国空间测量望远镜的宇宙剪切和大型同步巡天望远镜的超新星宇宙放大进行自相关和交叉相关的研究，旨在确定通过添加放大数据，能够在多大程度上消除宇宙剪切测量中的系统偏差。通过基于不同层次分析的相关性生成模拟的剪切/放大地图，得到了校正的功率谱。采用马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛技术拟合理论模型，研究了宇宙学和没用参数的限制。研究发现，仅使用宇宙剪切数据时，σ8和固有对齐模型参数存在1σ的偏差。但通过添加放大数据，可以完全消除这些偏差。<br /><br /> <div>
Cosmic shear and cosmic magnification reflect the same gravitational lensing field. Each of these two probes are affected by different systematics. We study the auto- and cross-correlations of cosmic shear from the China Space Survey Telescope and cosmic magnification of supernovae from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. We want to determine to what extent, by adding the magnification data, we can remove the systematic bias in cosmic shear measurements. We generate mock shear/magnification maps based on the correlation between different tomographic bins. After obtaining the corrected power spectra, we adopt the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique to fit the theoretical models and investigate the constraints on the cosmological and nuisance parameters. We find that, with only the cosmic shear data, there are 1σ biases in the σ8 and intrinsic alignment model parameters. By adding the magnification data, we are able to remove these biases perfectly.

<div> 关键词：超大质量黑洞、活动星系核、热吹流、离子化铁发射线、X射线光谱

总结：<br /><br />本文报告了在M81*和NGC 7213两个典型的低光度活动星系核中，探测到了高离化铁发射线的Doppler位移，并进一步确认了软X射线谱中的蓝移H-like O/Ne发射线。这些线被解释为与额外的具有几千千米每秒速度和较低温度的流组件相关联。经过详细的数值模拟，发现新增检测到的蓝移发射线应来自被热风冲击加热的核周气体。热风可以在颗粒状核周气体上提供比中央黑洞引力更大的冲压力，有效阻碍了黑洞对气体的吸积。这些结果为热AGN风的能量和动量反馈提供了强有力的证据。 <div>
Supermassive black holes in galaxies spend the majority of their lifetime in the low-luminosity regime, powered by hot accretion flow. Strong winds launched from the hot accretion flow have the potential to play an important role in active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback. Direct observational evidence for these hot winds with temperatures around 10 keV, has been obtained through the detection of highly ionized iron emission lines with Doppler shifts in two prototypical low-luminosity AGNs, namely M81* and NGC 7213. In this work, we further identify blueshifted H-like O/Ne emission lines in the soft X-ray spectra of these two sources. These lines are interpreted to be associated with additional outflowing components possessing velocity around several 103 km s−1 and lower temperature (∼0.2–0.4 keV). Blueshifted velocity and the X-ray intensity of these additional outflowing components are hard to explain by previously detected hot wind freely propagating to larger radii. Through detailed numerical simulations, we find the newly detected blueshifted emission lines would come from circumnuclear gas shock-heated by the hot wind instead. Hot wind can provide a larger ram pressure force on the clumpy circumnuclear gas than the gravitational force from the central black hole, effectively impeding the black hole accretion of gas. Our results provide strong evidence for the energy and momentum feedback by the hot AGN wind.

<div> 超级地球、次海王星、化学平衡、氢气大气、密度预测
<br />
超级地球和次海王星是两种亚类的小型外行星。研究发现，大部分超级地球通过热驱动风失去了其原初积聚的氢气大气，并且氢气会被有效地嵌入到内部，氧化铁并产生约0.5%至1.0%的水。由于大气不断被加工和化学平衡，尽管按摩尔比例氢气仍然占主导地位，按质量比例而言却变成了以蒸汽为主导。这可能可以通过JWST观测到具有过渡性质量的行星。有效地将氢气嵌入到内部的一个主要效果是使得整体内部密度低于地球。我们预测1M⊕行星的整体密度约为5.0 g cm−3，这与高精度的质量测量以及大气逸出模型的族群级推断分析是一致的。 
<br /><br />总结: 本文研究了超级地球和次海王星的化学平衡，发现大部分超级地球通过热驱动风失去了氢气大气，并且氢气会被有效地嵌入到内部，导致产生约0.5%至1.0%的水。大气通过加工和化学平衡持续演变，并且氢气逐渐被嵌入到内部。根据预测，这种有效的氢气嵌入会使得超级地球整体内部密度低于地球。 <div>
Small, close-in exoplanets are divided into two subpopulations: super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. Most super-Earths are thought to have lost their primordially accreted hydrogen-dominated atmospheres via thermally driven winds. We consider the global chemical equilibrium of super-Earths and the lasting impacts of their fleeting hydrogen atmospheres. We find that hydrogen is efficiently sequestered into the interior, oxidizing iron and endogenously producing ∼0.5%–1.0% water by mass. As the atmospheres of super-Earths are continuously sculpted by mass loss and chemical equilibration, they remain hydrogen-dominated by mole (number) fraction but become steam-dominated by mass, which may be observable with JWST for planets transitioning across the radius valley. One of the main effects of efficient sequestration of hydrogen into the interior is to produce an underdense bulk interior compared to that of Earth. We predict bulk densities of super-Earths to be ∼5.0 g cm−3 for a 1M⊕ planet, which is consistent with high-precision mass measurements and also population-level inference analyses from atmospheric escape models.

总结: 这项研究强调了暗物质晕的角动量分布对盘状星系中棒状结构的形成和演化具有重要作用。通过N体模拟实验发现，角动量分布连续的暗物质晕会增强棒状结构的强度，而分布不连续的暗物质晕会减弱棒状结构的强度。这一发现有助于解决近期文献中关于高自旋暗物质晕中棒状结构演化的矛盾结果。因此，该研究显示了盘状星系系统初始条件设置的重要性，特别是暗物质晕角动量分布的不连续性，对棒状结构的演化产生了重要影响。 <div>
The dark matter halo properties, for example, mass, spin, and concentration, play a significant role in the formation and evolution of bars in disk galaxies. This study highlights the importance of a new parameter: the dark matter halo angular momentum distribution in the disk’s central region. We experiment with N-body galaxy models having a disk and dark matter similar to Milky Way–type galaxies. In these models, we vary the discontinuity of the angular momentum distribution of the halo (the total spin is the same for all models). Our N-body experiments suggest that bar forms in all models after a few Gyr of disk evolution. However, in the secular evolution of the bar, as we evolve these models until 9.78 Gyr, the bar gains its strength in the model with the most continuous halo angular momentum distribution, and the bar loses strength for the most discontinuous halo angular momentum distribution. The secular evolution of the bar suggests that box/peanut/x-shaped bulges similar to those found in the Milky Way disk should be more pronounced in halos with continuous halo angular momentum distributions. This study demonstrates the importance of the initial condition setup of galaxy systems, namely the discontinuity in the dark matter halo angular momentum distribution for a given density distribution, on the bar secular evolution in the disk galaxy simulations. Further, this study helps reconcile the conflicting results of bar secular evolution in a high-spinning halo of the recent literature.

We present an implementation of a Bayesian mixture model using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo techniques to search for the spatial separation of Galactic dust populations. Utilizing intensity measurements from the Planck High Frequency Instrument, we apply this model to high-latitude Galactic dust emission. Our analysis reveals a strong preference for a spatially varying two-population dust model over a one-population dust model, when the latter must capture the total variance in the sky. Each dust population is well characterized by a single-component spectral energy distribution (SED) and accommodates small variations. These populations could signify two distinct components or may originate from a one-component model with different temperatures resulting in different SED scalings. While no spatial information is built into the likelihood, our investigation unveils large-scale spatially coherent structures with high significance, pointing to a physical origin for the observed spatial variation. These results are robust to our choice of likelihood and input data. Furthermore, this spatially varying two-population model is the most favored from Bayesian evidence calculations. Incorporating IRAS 100 μm to constrain the Wein side of the blackbody function, we find the dust populations differ at the 2.5σ level in the spectral index (βd) versus temperature (Td) plane. The presence of multiple dust populations has implications for component separation techniques frequently employed in the recovery of the cosmic microwave background.

Magnetic fields in the stellar interiors are key candidates to explain observed core rotation rates inside solar-like stars along their evolution. Recently, asteroseismic estimates of radial magnetic field amplitudes near the hydrogen-burning shell (H-shell) inside about 24 red giants (RGs) have been obtained by measuring frequency splittings from their power spectra. Using general Lorentz-stress (magnetic) kernels, we investigated the potential for detectability of near-surface magnetism in a 1.3 M⊙ star of supersolar metallicity as it evolves from a mid subgiant to a late subgiant into an RG. Based on these sensitivity kernels, we decompose an RG into three zones—deep core, H-shell, and near-surface. The subgiants instead required decomposition into an inner core, an outer core, and a near-surface layer. Additionally, we find that for a low-frequency g-dominated dipolar mode in the presence of a typical stable magnetic field, ∼25% of the frequency shift comes from the H-shell and the remaining from deeper layers. The ratio of the subsurface tangential field to the radial field in the H-burning shell decides if subsurface fields may be potentially detectable. For p-dominated dipole modes close to , this ratio is around two orders of magnitude smaller in subgiant phases than the corresponding RG. Further, with the availability of magnetic kernels, we propose lower limits of field strengths in crucial layers in our stellar model during its evolutionary phases. The theoretical prescription outlined here provides the first formal way to devise inverse problems for stellar magnetism and can be seamlessly employed for slow rotators.

<br /><br />总结:
研究团队对 z ∼ 6.6 类星体 J0923+0402 的黑洞驱动流进行了多尺度和多相特征化，并评估了这些气流对冷气体储库的影响。他们发现在约210 pc的尺度上存在一个强劲的电离气流，并且ALMA观测发现了高速度的[C ii]发射，可能与主宇宙体内含的冷中性气体有关，以及一个大小约15 kpc的[C ii]光晕。该研究首次准确限制了离子化和原子中性气体相的气流能量学特征，发现这种特征与高效反馈机制相一致，并且可能存在排出和预防性反馈模式。离子化气流和原子气流的尺度和能量特征表明它们可能与不同的类星体吸积事件相关联。该研究结果表明在 z ≳ 6 处的类星体中存在强烈的黑洞反馈作用，很可能塑造了冷气体储库的性质，直至周银河范围。 <div>
Although the mass growth of supermassive black holes during the epoch of reionization is expected to play a role in shaping the concurrent growth of their host galaxies, observational evidence of feedback at z ≳ 6 is still sparse. We perform the first multiscale and multiphase characterization of black-hole-driven outflows in the z ∼ 6.6 quasar J0923+0402 and assess how these winds impact the cold gas reservoir. We employ the SimBAL spectral synthesis to fit broad absorption line features and find a powerful ionized outflow on a ≲210 pc scale, with a kinetic power ∼2%–100% of the quasar luminosity. Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of [C ii] emission allow us to study the morphology and kinematics of the cold gas. We detect high-velocity [C ii] emission, likely associated with a cold neutral outflow at ∼0.5−2 kpc scale in the host galaxy, and a bright extended [C ii] halo with a size of ∼15 kpc. For the first time at such an early epoch, we accurately constrain the outflow energetics in both the ionized and the atomic neutral gas phases. We find such energetics to be consistent with expectations for an efficient feedback mechanism, and both ejective and preventative feedback modes are likely at play. The scales and energetics of the ionized and atomic outflows suggest that they might be associated with different quasar accretion episodes. The results of this work indicate that strong black hole feedback is occurring in quasars at z ≳ 6 and is likely responsible for shaping the properties of the cold gas reservoir up to circumgalactic scales.

We present an extension of the massively parallel, GPU native, astrophysical hydrodynamics code Cholla to magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Cholla solves the ideal MHD equations in their Eulerian form on a static Cartesian mesh utilizing the Van Leer + constrained transport integrator, the HLLD Riemann solver, and reconstruction methods at second and third order. Cholla’s MHD module can perform ≈260 million cell updates per GPU-second on an NVIDIA A100 while using the HLLD Riemann solver and second order reconstruction. The inherently parallel nature of GPUs combined with increased memory in new hardware allows Cholla’s MHD module to perform simulations with resolutions ∼5003 cells on a single high-end GPU (e.g., an NVIDIA A100 with 80 GB of memory). We employ GPU direct Message Passing Interface to attain excellent weak scaling on the exascale supercomputer Frontier, while using 74,088 GPUs and simulating a total grid size of over 7.2 trillion cells. A suite of test problems highlights the accuracy of Cholla’s MHD module and demonstrates that zero magnetic divergence in solutions is maintained to round off error. We also present new testing and CI tools using GoogleTest, GitHub Actions, and Jenkins that have made development more robust and accurate and ensure reliability in the future.

长期模拟研究恒星和盘的形成过程，采用三维非理想磁流体动力学。模拟从原恒星云开始，经过盘的长期演化，最终距离原恒星形成约1.5x10^5年。主要的磁力制动和磁驱动的流出作用导致主要的吸积阶段盘的大小约为50天文单位并且主要没有次级结构。当流出突破云层时，导致包层质量迅速减少，主要吸积阶段结束。流出在质量吸积率减小的同时也减弱。盘的包层吸积结束后，盘逐渐增长并出现瞬时的螺旋结构，这是由于引力不稳定性导致的。当包层吸积结束后，盘变得稳定并且达到约300天文单位大小。此外，约30%的初始云质量被流出排斥。研究的一个重要发现是，包层消散后，流出出现再次活跃，盘表面有质量排出，这种排出（或盘风）是因为此时磁压显著支配了盘的上下方面的动压和热压。利用估计的角动量通量和质量损失率，估算盘消散的时间尺度约为10^6年。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究使用三维非理想磁流体动力学模拟了恒星和盘的形成过程。模拟表明，磁性制动和磁驱动的流出在主要的吸积阶段起到重要作用。当主要吸积阶段结束后，盘逐渐增长并发展出临时的螺旋结构，最终盘变得稳定并且达到较大规模。研究还发现，包层消散后，盘表面出现质量排出，推测盘的消散时间尺度约为10^6年。 <div>
We perform a long-term simulation of star and disk formation using three-dimensional nonideal magnetohydrodynamics. The simulation starts from a prestellar cloud and proceeds through the long-term evolution of the circumstellar disk until ∼1.5 × 105 yr after protostar formation. The disk has size ≲50 au and little substructure in the main accretion phase because of the action of magnetic braking and the magnetically driven outflow to remove angular momentum. The main accretion phase ends when the outflow breaks out of the cloud, causing the envelope mass to decrease rapidly. The outflow subsequently weakens as the mass accretion rate also weakens. While the envelope-to-disk accretion continues, the disk grows gradually and develops transient spiral structures, due to gravitational instability. When the envelope-to-disk accretion ends, the disk becomes stable and reaches a size ≳300 au. In addition, about 30% of the initial cloud mass has been ejected by the outflow. A significant finding of this work is that after the envelope dissipates a revitalization of the wind occurs, and there is mass ejection from the disk surface that lasts until the end of the simulation. This mass ejection (or disk wind) is generated because the magnetic pressure significantly dominates both the ram pressure and thermal pressure above and below the disk at this stage. Using the angular momentum flux and mass-loss rate estimated from the disk wind, the disk dissipation timescale is estimated to be ∼106 yr.

Due to their inability to self-regulate, ultrafaint dwarfs are sensitive to prescriptions in subgrid physics models that converge and regulate at higher masses. We use high-resolution cosmological simulations to compare the effect of bursty star formation histories (SFHs) on dwarf galaxy structure for two different subgrid supernova (SN) feedback models, superbubble and blastwave, in dwarf galaxies with stellar masses from 5000 < M*/M⊙ < 109. We find that in the “MARVEL-ous Dwarfs” suite both feedback models produce cored galaxies and reproduce observed scaling relations for luminosity, mass, and size. Our sample accurately predicts the average stellar metallicity at higher masses, however low-mass dwarfs are metal poor relative to observed galaxies in the Local Group. We show that continuous bursty star formation and the resulting stellar feedback are able to create dark matter (DM) cores in the higher dwarf galaxy mass regime, while the majority of ultrafaint and classical dwarfs retain cuspy central DM density profiles. We find that the effective core formation peaks at M*/Mhalo ≃ 5 × 10−3 for both feedback models. Both subgrid SN models yield bursty SFHs at higher masses; however, galaxies simulated with superbubble feedback reach maximum mean burstiness values at lower stellar mass fractions relative to blastwave feedback. As a result, core formation may be better predicted by stellar mass fraction than the burstiness of SFHs.

Within the coronae of stars, abundances of those elements with low first ionization potential (FIP) often differ from their photospheric values. The coronae of the Sun and solar-type stars mostly show enhancements of low-FIP elements (the FIP effect) while more active stars such as M dwarfs have coronae generally characterized by the inverse-FIP (I-FIP) effect. Highly localized regions of I-FIP effect solar plasma have been observed by Hinode's EUV Imaging Spectrometer in a number of highly complex active regions (ARs), usually around strong light bridges of the umbrae of coalescing/merging sunspots. These observations can be interpreted in the context of the ponderomotive force fractionation model, which predicts that plasma with I-FIP effect composition is created by the refraction of waves coming from below the plasma fractionation region in the chromosphere. A plausible source of these waves is thought to be reconnection in the (high-plasma-β) subchromospheric magnetic field. In this study, we use the 3D visualization technique of Chintzoglou & Zhang combined with observations of localized I-FIP effect in the corona of AR 11504 to identify potential sites of such reconnection and its possible consequences in the solar atmosphere. We found subtle signatures of episodic heating and reconnection outflows in the expected places, in between magnetic flux tubes forming a light bridge, within the photosphere of the AR. Furthermore, on either side of the light bridge, we observed small antiparallel horizontal magnetic field components, supporting the possibility of reconnection occurring where we observe I-FIP plasma. When taken together with the I-FIP effect observations, these subtle signatures provide a compelling case for indirect observational evidence of reconnection below the fractionation layer of the chromosphere, however direct evidence remains elusive.

Recently, Magg et al. introduced a new value for (Z/X)s, which is still under debate in the community. The solar abundance problem or solar modeling problem remains a topic of ongoing debate. We constructed rotating solar models in accordance with various abundance scales where the effects of convection overshoot and enhanced diffusion were included. Among these models, those utilizing Magg’s abundance scale exhibit superior sound speed and density profiles compared to models using other abundance scales. Additionally, they reproduce the observed frequency separation ratios r02 and r13. These models also match the seismically inferred surface helium abundance and convection zone depth within the 1σ level. Furthermore, the calculated neutrino fluxes from these models agree with detected ones at the level of 1σ. We found that neutrino fluxes and density profile are influenced by nuclear reactions, allowing us to use the combination of detected neutrino fluxes and seismically inferred density for diagnosing astrophysical S-factors. This diagnostic approach shows that S11 may be underestimated by 2%, while S33 may be overestimated by about 3% in previous determinations. The S-factors favored by updated neutrino fluxes and helioseismic results can lead to significant improvements in solar models.

CMEs是太阳大气事件的关键组成部分，其周期性变化对于理解太阳大尺度磁场的循环演化至关重要。本文利用太阳和日球际观测卫星的CDAW目录，采用连续小波变换方法，对CME的速度和加速度进行分析。研究结果发现，不同速度的CME在时间上的分布存在明显差异，出现了Rieger型周期和准二年振荡的CME。这两种周期信号在太阳23和24周期中有显著差异。此外，北半球和南半球的周期性模式也存在差异。文章对结果进行了潜在机制和解释的讨论。<br /><br />总结: CME是太阳大气事件的关键组成部分，其周期性变化对于理解太阳大尺度磁场的循环演化至关重要。文章利用CDAW目录和连续小波变换方法对CME进行了分析，发现了不同速度CME的时间分布差异、Rieger型周期和准二年振荡的CME等现象，并讨论了太阳23和24周期中的差异以及北半球和南半球的周期性模式差异。 <div>
Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) exhibit a wide range of quasiperiodic variations and are crucial for our understanding of the cyclical evolution of large-scale magnetic fields. However, the mid-term periodicities of different types of CMEs associated with different processes at the source location need to be clearly understood. Based on the CDAW catalog released by the Large Angle and Spectroscopic Coronagraph mission on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, we investigated the period of CMEs based on the speeds and accelerations using the continuous wavelet transformation method. Our results revealed that the distribution of CMEs over time is quite distinctly different for different speeds, and there are Rieger-type periods and quasi-biennial oscillations of the CMEs. The two types of periodic signals show significant differences in solar cycles 23 and 24. Furthermore, the periodicity patterns for the northern hemisphere differ from those in the southern hemisphere. The potential mechanisms and explanations of the results are also discussed.

<div> 观测，James Webb Space Telescope, NIRCam, 信噪比，观测数据，测光精度
总结:
观测了局部星系目标的解析星的数据，使用 James Webb Space Telescope NIRCam Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) v3.0 进行了实证评估。对于明亮的恒星，发现ETC和观测之间的纯泊松估计的信噪比一致良好，但非理想效应是目前可以达到的光度精度的限制因素。对于暗淡的恒星，发现ETC的信噪比估计受到光度精度影响的选择，可以影响曝光时间的估计长达5倍。最后，还量化了拥挤对信噪比的影响，并提供了估计ETC预测拥挤效应的指导方针。 <div>
We empirically assess estimates from v3.0 of the James Webb Space Telescope NIRCam Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) using observations of resolved stars in Local Group targets taken as part of the Resolved Stellar Populations Early Release Science (ERS) Program. For bright stars, we find that (i) purely Poissonian estimates of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are in good agreement between the ETC and observations, but nonideal effects (e.g., flat-field uncertainties) are the current limiting factor in the photometric precision that can be achieved; (ii) source position offsets, relative to the detector pixels, have a large impact on the ETC saturation predictions and introducing subpixel dithers in the observation design can improve the saturation limits by up to ∼1 mag. For faint stars, for which the sky dominates the error budget, we find that the choice in the ETC extraction strategy (e.g., aperture size relative to point-spread function size) can affect the exposure time estimates by up to a factor of 5. We provide guidelines for configuring the ETC aperture photometry to produce SNR predictions in line with the ERS data. Finally, we quantify the effects of crowding on the SNRs over a large dynamic range in stellar density and provide guidelines for approximating the effects of crowding on SNRs predicted by the ETC.

<div> solar coronal magnetic field, WSA model, spherical harmonic expansion, finite-difference potential field solutions, side-by-side comparisons<br />总结:<br />该论文比较了传统的基于球谐展开的WSA模型实现和最近开源的有限差分代码POT3D所产生的WSA模型。比较了模型的末端太阳风速度和磁场，观察了在计算过程、参数和输入微小扰动的情况下WSA模型的变化。同时比较了外边界处磁场线的足点和模型中开放磁场的位置。研究发现，追踪的磁场线足点显示出显著的一致性，在磁中性线和极区存在最大差异。 <div>
The Wang–Sheeley–Arge (WSA) model has been in use for decades and remains a popular, economical approach to modeling the solar coronal magnetic field and forecasting conditions in the inner heliosphere. Given its usefulness, it is unsurprising that a number of WSA implementations have been developed by various groups with different computational approaches. While the WSA magnetic field model has traditionally been calculated using a spherical harmonic expansion of the solar magnetic field, finite-difference potential field solutions can offer speed and/or accuracy advantages. However, the creation of new versions of WSA requires that we ensure the solutions from these new models are consistent with established versions and that we quantify for the user community to what degree and in what ways they differ. In this paper, we present side-by-side comparisons of WSA models produced using the traditional, spherical harmonic–based implementation developed by Wang, Sheeley, and Arge with WSA models produced using a recently open-sourced finite-difference code from the CORHEL modeling suite called POT3D. We present comparisons of the terminal solar wind speed and magnetic field at the outer boundaries of the models, weighing these against the variation of the WSA model in the presence of small perturbations in the computational procedure, parameters, and inputs. We also compare the footpoints of magnetic field lines traced from the outer boundaries and the locations of open field in the models. We find that the traced field-line footpoints show remarkable agreement, with the greatest differences near the magnetic neutral line and in the polar regions.

研究发现，银河系的形成与宇宙中其他星系的盘形成具有密切联系。星系盘的组装受到同一平面内的气体流入、平面外的气体流出以及盘内恒星形成的相互影响。最新的光谱和光度调查表明，银河系的镁丰度和星形成速率在不同的回顾时间内呈现出不同的径向分布。这些结果与"泄漏式吸积盘"模型的预测相吻合，支持了银河系的组装是符合该模型的。另外，银河系的有效产出约束与恒星化学演化模型的理论预测也基本一致。这些结果将我们对银河系盘的形成贯穿到了宇宙中其他星系盘形成的大局之中。 <div>
Both simulations and observations suggest that the disk assembly of galaxies is governed by the interplay between coplanar gas inflow, ex-planar gas outflow, and in situ star formation on the disk, known as the leaky accretion disk. This scenario predicts a strong connection between radial distributions of star formation and chemical abundances. The Milky Way, being the sole Galaxy where we can reliably measure star formation histories and the corresponding temporally resolved chemical abundances with individual stars, provides a unique opportunity to scrutinize this scenario. Based on the recent large spectroscopic and photometric surveys of Milky Way stars, we obtain the radial profiles of magnesium abundance ([Mg/H]) and star formation rate surface density at different lookback times. We find the radial profiles of [Mg/H] can be well-reproduced using the leaky accretion disk model with only two free parameters for stars formed within 4 Gyr, as well as the flattening at large radii of metallicity profiles traced by H ii regions and Cepheids. Furthermore, the constraint effective yield of the Milky Way and nearby galaxies shows broad consistency with the theoretical predictions from the stellar chemical evolution model with a mass-loading factor of 0–2. These results support that the recent assembly of the Milky Way adheres to the leaky accretion disk scenario, bridging the disk formation of our home Galaxy to the big picture of disk formation in the Universe.

We characterize the earliest galaxy population in the JADES Origins Field, the deepest imaging field observed with JWST. We make use of ancillary Hubble Space Telescope optical images (five filters spanning 0.4–0.9 μm) and novel JWST images with 14 filters spanning 0.8−5 μm, including seven medium-band filters, and reaching total exposure times of up to 46 hr per filter. We combine all our data at >2.3 μm to construct an ultradeep image, reaching as deep as ≈31.4 AB mag in the stack and 30.3–31.0 AB mag (5σ, r = 0.″1 circular aperture) in individual filters. We measure photometric redshifts and use robust selection criteria to identify a sample of eight galaxy candidates at redshifts z = 11.5−15. These objects show compact half-light radii of R1/2 ∼ 50−200 pc, stellar masses of M⋆ ∼ 107−108 M☉, and star formation rates ∼ 0.1−1 M☉ yr−1. Our search finds no candidates at 15 < z < 20, placing upper limits at these redshifts. We develop a forward-modeling approach to infer the properties of the evolving luminosity function without binning in redshift or luminosity that marginalizes over the photometric redshift uncertainty of our candidate galaxies and incorporates the impact of nondetections. We find a z = 12 luminosity function in good agreement with prior results, and that the luminosity function normalization and UV luminosity density decline by a factor of ∼2.5 from z = 12 to z = 14. We discuss the possible implications of our results in the context of theoretical models for evolution of the dark matter halo mass function.

We describe the Stagger code for simulations of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) systems. This is a modular code with a variety of physics modules that will let the user run simulations of deep stellar atmospheres, sunspot formation, stellar chromospheres and coronae, proto-stellar disks, star formation from giant molecular clouds, and even galaxy formation. The Stagger code is efficiently and highly parallelizable, enabling such simulations with large ranges of both spatial and temporal scales. We describe the methodology of the code and present the most important of the physics modules, as well as its input and output variables. We show results of a number of standard MHD tests to enable comparison with other, similar codes. In addition, we provide an overview of tests that have been carried out against solar observations, ranging from spectral line shapes, spectral flux distribution, limb darkening, intensity and velocity distributions of granulation, to seismic power spectra and the excitation of p-modes. The Stagger code has proven to be a high-fidelity code with a large range of uses.

<div> LIRGs, AGN, morphological analysis, 16 μm flux-density, star formation<br />
总结: 本文对0.8 < z < 1.3的16 μm流量密度限制的星系样本进行了形态学分析。研究发现，在目标红移处，16 μm发射对应于来自强烈恒星形成的多环芳烃特征，或者活跃星系核加热的尘埃。样本中67%为LIRGs，主要分为AGN主导型、星形成主导型、复合型和蓝色紧凑星系。大部分样本（71%）呈盘状形态，少数AGN主导星系比星形成主导型和复合型星系更偏向球状。ULIRGs子样本遵循陡峭的大小-质量关系，与早期星系更为接近。此外，随着4.5 μm亮度过剩（AGN强度的代理）的增加，样本呈现更多的球状特征。根据特定恒星形成率和紧凑性图，大部分LIRG主导的星系样本沿着渐进演化轨迹发展，与任何并合活动无关。样本中的16个ULIRGs中有6个紧凑并且具有强烈AGN贡献，可能沿着更激烈活动的快速轨迹演化。 <div>
We present a morphological analysis of the 16 μm flux-density-limited galaxy sample at 0.8 < z < 1.3 from Huang et al. (2021). At the targeted redshift, the 16 μm emission corresponds to the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon feature from intense star formation, or dust heated by active galactic nuclei (AGN). Our sample of 479 galaxies are dominated by luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs; 67%) in three CANDLES fields (Extended Groth Strip, Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey North and South fields), and are further divided into AGN-dominated, star-forming dominated, composite, and blue compact galaxies by their spectral energy distribution types. The majority of our sample (71%) have disk morphologies, with the few AGN-dominated galaxies being more bulge-dominated than the star-forming-dominated and composite galaxies. The distribution of our sample on the Gini versus M20 plane is consistent with previous studies, where the Sérsic index n shows an increasing trend toward the smaller M20 and higher Gini region below the dividing line for mergers. The subsample of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) follows a steep size–mass relation that is closer to the early-type galaxies. In addition, as the 4.5 μm luminosity excess ( , proxy for AGN strength) increases, our sample appears to be more bulge dominated (i.e., higher n). Based on the specific star formation rate and compactness ( ) diagram, the majority of our LIRG-dominated galaxy sample follows a secular evolution track, and their distribution can be explained without involving any merging activities. Out of the 16 ULIRGs in our sample, six are compact with strong AGN contributions, likely evolving along the fast track from more violent activities.

使用IRIS观测的太阳耀斑数据显示，色球凝聚（CCs）的形成与演化时间尺度和速度与之前的理论模型存在较大差异。研究发现，CCs的寿命平均为1分钟，且随最大速度（vmax）的增加而延长。这表明太阳耀斑的大气层和加热场景可能比Fisher最初假设的要复杂。此外，约90%的样本显示存在可观测的加速阶段，这些加速阶段不仅可作为耀斑模型的诊断指标，还可以用来计算其他模型诊断，如初始加速质量。总结: <br /><br /> <div>
Chromospheric condensations (CCs) are a prominent feature of flare footpoint heating in the solar flare standard model, yet their timescales and velocities are not well understood. Fisher derived several important analytical relationships, which have rarely been examined with modern spectral observations. The Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) provides a wealth of flare data with a high enough cadence to sufficiently capture CC evolution. We analyzed Doppler shifts in Mg ii 2791 and Fe ii 2814 from a sample of flare footpoint pixels observed by IRIS to compare with Fisher's analytics and recent flare models. We found a detection lifetime of 1 minute occurs in 50% of the sample, with Mg ii showing several pixels with longer values and Fe ii almost categorically shorter, and both growing with the maximum velocity, vmax. The shifts’ half-life is commonly <40 s and is inversely related to vmax, indicating that the first half of the CC evolution has more efficient kinetic energy loss. The lifetime’s wide range and growth with vmax indicate that the footpoint atmospherics and heating scenarios can vary more widely than first postulated in Fisher. Around 90% of the sample had observable acceleration periods, lasting an average of 38 and 32 s for Mg ii and Fe ii, respectively. These acceleration periods, as well as serving as flare model diagnostics themselves, could potentially be used to calculate other model diagnostics such as the initially accelerated mass.

<div> 关键词: HZ, 气候调节, 硅酸盐风化, 大气CO2分压, 行星

总结:
行星的大气CO2分压对气候稳定有重要影响，特别是在行星太阳辐射较低的外部Habitable Zone范围内。研究表明，在这种情况下，随着大气CO2分压和温度的增加，全球蒸发和降水会减少，导致硅酸盐风化减少，从而可能导致CO2累积或CO2耗尽，进而导致气候失稳和可能的“雪球地球”情况。这暗示着在HZ的外部范围内，硅酸盐风化可能无法维持适宜的气候条件。 <div>
Implicit in the definition of the classical circumstellar habitable zone (HZ) is the hypothesis that the carbonate-silicate cycle can maintain clement climates on exoplanets with land and surface water across a range of instellations by adjusting atmospheric CO2 partial pressure (pCO2). This hypothesis is made by analogy to the Earth system, but it is an open question whether silicate weathering can stabilize climate on planets in the outer reaches of the HZ, where instellations are lower than those received by even the Archean Earth and CO2 is thought likely to dominate atmospheres. Since weathering products are carried from land to ocean by the action of water, silicate weathering is intimately coupled to the hydrologic cycle, which intensifies with hotter temperatures under Earth-like conditions. Here, we use global climate model simulations to demonstrate that the hydrologic cycle responds counterintuitively to changes in climate on planets with CO2-H2O atmospheres at low instellations and high pCO2, with global evaporation and precipitation decreasing as pCO2 and temperatures increase at a given instellation. Within the Maher & Chamberlain (or MAC) weathering formulation, weathering then decreases with increasing pCO2 for a range of instellations and pCO2 typical of the outer reaches of the HZ, resulting in an unstable carbon cycle that may lead to either runaway CO2 accumulation or depletion of CO2 to colder (possibly snowball) conditions. While the behavior of the system has not been completely mapped out, the results suggest that silicate weathering could fail to maintain habitable conditions in the outer reaches of the nominal HZ.

<br /><br />总结: 挖掘到了一个被引力透镜的星系MACS J0717_Az9，发现其分子气体含量较低，PDR模型表明其条件与本地星系相似，运动受到旋转的控制。这一发现可能代表被现有调查漏掉的更为普遍的星系群。 <div>
We present the molecular gas content and interstellar medium conditions of MACS J0717_Az9, a strong gravitationally lensed z = 4.273, M* ≃ 2 × 109 M⊙ star-forming galaxy with an unusually high (∼80%) obscured star formation fraction. We detect CO (4–3) in two independent lensed images, as well as [N ii] 205 μm, with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. We derive a molecular gas mass of log , making it moderately deficient in molecular gas compared to the lower-redshift gas fraction scaling relation. Leveraging photodissociation region (PDR) models, we combine our CO (4–3) measurements with existing measurements of the [C ii] 158 μm line and total infrared luminosity to model the PDR conditions. We find PDR conditions similar to those in local star-forming galaxies, with a mean hydrogen density log10[nH cm−3] = 4.80 ± 0.39 and a mean radiation field strength log10[G0 Habing] = 2.83 ± 0.26. Based on Band 3 continuum data, we derive an upper limit on the intrinsic dust mass of log10[Mdust(M⊙)] < 7.73, consistent with existing estimates. We use the 3D tilted-ring model fitting code 3D-Barolo to determine the kinematic properties of the CO (4–3) emitting gas. We find that it is rotationally dominated, with a V/σ = 4.6 ± 1.7, consistent with the kinematics of the [C ii]. With PDR conditions remarkably similar to those in normal dusty star-forming galaxies at z < 0.2 and a stable molecular disk, our observations of Az9 suggest that the dust-obscured phase for a low-mass galaxy at z ∼ 4 is relatively long. Thus, Az9 may be representative of a more widespread population that has been missed owing to insufficiently deep existing millimeter surveys.

这篇文章利用ALMA探测到了CH3OH和其三种重氘化物质在低质量原恒星源B335附近的光谱线发射。它们在24天文单位的范围内呈环状分布，在连续谱峰处出现了强度减小。研究得出了这些物质在盘/包层系统中六个位置以及连续谱峰的柱密度和丰度比。CH3OH的D/H比率约为0.03-0.13，[CHD2OH]/[CH2DOH]比值更高，约为0.14-0.29。而[CH2DOH]/[CH3OD]比值约为4.9-15，高于统计比值3，并与其他低质量源报道的比值相当。通过分析CH3OH和HCOOH的线发射，研究了B335内数个天文单位尺度上的物理结构，发现了合理的入射旋转运动速度结构。得出B335具有小型盘结构的年轻原恒星和原恒星质量约为0.03-0.07太阳质量，离心力障的上限小于7天文单位。这种年轻的原恒星可能与相对较高的[CH2DOH]/[CH3OH]比值有关。
<br /><br />总结: 该研究利用ALMA探测了CH3OH和其三种重氘化物质在低质量原恒星源B335附近的光谱线发射，讨论了它们的分布和性质。通过分析这些物质在盘/包层系统中的柱密度和丰度比，研究了B335的物理结构，并推断出其具有小型盘结构的年轻原恒星。 <div>
Deuterium fractionation in the closest vicinity of a protostar is important in understanding its potential heritage to a planetary system. Here, we have detected the spectral line emission of CH3OH and its three deuterated species, CH2DOH, CHD2OH, and CH3OD, toward the low-mass protostellar source B335 at a resolution of 0.″03 (5 au) with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. They have a ring distribution within the radius of 24 au with the intensity depression at the continuum peak. We derive the column densities and abundance ratios of the above species at six positions in the disk/envelope system as well as the continuum peak. The D/H ratio of CH3OH is ∼[0.03–0.13], which is derived by correcting the statistical weight of 3 for CH2DOH. The [CHD2OH]/[CH2DOH] ratio is derived to be higher ([0.14–0.29]). On the other hand, the [CH2DOH]/[CH3OD] ratio ([4.9–15]) is higher than the statistical ratio of 3 and is comparable to those reported for other low-mass sources. We study the physical structure on a few astronomical unit scales in B335 by analyzing the CH3OH (183,15 − 182,16, A) and HCOOH (120,12 − 110,11) line emission. Velocity structures of these lines are reasonably explained as the infalling-rotating motion. The protostellar mass and the upper limit to the centrifugal barrier are thus derived to be 0.03–0.07 M⊙ and <7 au, respectively, showing that B335 harbors a young protostar with a tiny disk structure. Such youth of the protostar may be related to the relatively high [CH2DOH]/[CH3OH] ratio.

With space missions such as Kepler, TESS, and Gaia, we have a wealth of data on pulsating white dwarfs that can be leveraged in white dwarf asteroseismology. We address the question of the proportion of white dwarfs with thin hydrogen layers versus those with thick hydrogen layers. We also provide a mass–radius relation for carbon–oxygen-core, hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarfs. Such a relationship can be used in conjunction with magnitudes and distance measurements to constrain the mass and effective temperature of the white dwarfs. We select nine hydrogen-atmosphere pulsating white dwarfs for their rich pulsation spectra. From such pulsation spectra, we can derive the asymptotic period spacing, which in turn allows us to determine the thickness of the hydrogen and helium envelope of the models, without having to perform period-by-period fitting. We find that the majority of the white dwarfs have thicker hydrogen layers and we determine an upper limit of Mr = 1–10−2.2 for the location of the base of the helium layer, in accordance with stellar evolution models. We confirm a finding from earlier studies that used a mass–radius relation and Gaia data to determine the effective temperatures of white dwarfs. The Gaia data systematically point to white dwarfs of lower effective temperature than indicated by the spectroscopy. Our results also support the hypothesis that white dwarfs with thicker hydrogen layers are more common than those with thinner layers.

<div> HCO+, isotopic species, laboratory spectra, accurate measurements, astrophysical tracers
总结:
HCO+的重氧同位素对于天体物理学的研究非常重要，实验室记录了HC18O+、DC18O+、HC17O+和DC17O+的基态旋转谱，通过频率调制亚毫米波谱仪进行吸收光谱记录，进行了高水平的从头算计算以获取分子参数和碰撞效应的理论估计，并提供了DC17O+的首批实验旋转数据。这些结果支持当前和未来的天文学研究，为Atacama大型毫米/亚毫米波阵列观测对象的分析提供了更新的基准频率数据，HC18O+示踪剂的推导数据集达到了1.5 THz的精确度为数十亿分之几。 <div>
Heavy oxygen isotopic species of HCO+ are important optically thin astrophysical tracers. The ground-state rotational spectrum of HC18O+, DC18O+, HC17O+, and DC17O+ has been recorded in the laboratory in the frequency range from 85 GHz to 1.3 THz. The ions have been produced in the negative column of a glow-discharge plasma, and their spectrum has been recorded in absorption using a frequency-modulation submillimeter-wave spectrometer. Various sources of systematic error have been carefully accounted for in order to obtain highly accurate line-position measurements. Theoretical estimates of the molecular parameters and of the collision effects on the line shape have been obtained by high-level ab initio calculations. The analysis yielded much improved rotational and centrifugal distortion constants, thus bringing the spectroscopic characterization of these rare isotopic variants to the same level of the parent species. Also, the first experimental rotational data for DC17O+ have been provided. These results allow for the calculation of an updated set of rest frequencies to support current and future astrophysical studies. The derived data set for the widely used HC18O+ tracer reaches an accuracy of a few parts in 109 up to 1.5 THz. Such accuracy is important for the analysis of astrophysical objects targeted by Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations at the submillimeter regime.

<div> ALMA, protoplanetary disk, T Tauri stars, magnetized disk wind, DM Tau
<br /><br />总结:
ALMA观测了200多个原行星盘系统，大部分显示有行星存在。过渡盘中的尘埃间隙被认为是巨行星在合适的盘粘度下雕刻气体和尘埃的证据。然而，许多托瑞星系中的过渡盘具有异常高的吸积速率，挑战了这一理论。最近的理论进展挑战了传统的盘间隙形成理论和粘度驱动的吸积模型，提出了有磁化的盘风模型。研究表明，在磁化盘风占主导的吸积模式下，DM Tau系统内可能存在着一个中等质量的行星。这意味着DM Tau可能并不像想象中的那么湍动。然而，盘内粘度也应该对维持盘稳定性起到一定的湍动贡献。 <div>
Over 200 protoplanetary disk systems have been resolved by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and the vast majority suggest the presence of planets. The dust gaps in transition disks are considered evidence of giant planets sculpting gas and dust under appropriate disk viscosity. However, the unusually high accretion rates in many T Tauri stars hosting transition disks challenge this theory. As the only disk currently observed with high turbulence, the high accretion rate (∼10−8.3 M⊙ yr−1) observed in DM Tau indicates the presence of strong turbulence within the system. Considering the recent theoretical advancements in magnetized disk winds are challenging the traditional gap-opening theories and viscosity-driven accretion models, our study presents a pioneering simulation incorporating a simplified magnetized disk wind model to explain the observed features in DM Tau. Employing multifluid simulations with an embedded medium mass planet, we successfully replicate the gap formation and asymmetric structures evident in ALMA Band 6 and the recent Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array 7 mm observations. Our results suggest that when magnetized disk wind dominates the accretion mode of the system, it is entirely possible for a planet with a medium mass to exist within the gap inside 20 au of DM Tau. This means that DM Tau may not be as turbulent as imagined. However, viscosity within the disk should also contribute a little turbulence to maintain disk stability.

本研究利用哈勃空间望远镜对Draco矮椭圆星系进行了四个时代共计18年的成像分析。研究测量了数百颗恒星的精确自行速度，并结合现有的视向速度。这为任何矮星系提供了第一个径向解析的三维速度离散度轮廓。这些测量对内在速度各向异性进行了约束，并解决了质量-各向异性的退化问题。研究利用扁平轴对称几何形状解决了杰恩斯方程，推断出质量分布。研究发现速度离散度沿对称轴向径向各向异性，并在赤道平面上切向各向异性，并且在全局范围内平均值为（其中1-在3D）。观测到的径向范围内，暗物质（DM）密度斜率的对数为，与ΛCDM宇宙学中预测的内部尖峰一致。作为Draco低质量和古老星形成历史的预期，它似乎没有被重子过程溶解。我们在1σ、2σ和3σ置信水平上排除了大于487、717和942 pc的核心，因此对自相互作用暗物质截面施加了重要约束。球对称模型会产生对速度各向异性和推断斜率的偏倚估计。在我们最外层数据点（900 pc）处的圆周速度为。我们推断了动力学距离为kpc，并显示Draco具有适度的视向旋转，为所谓的“尖峰-核心”问题提供了新的严格测试，可以很容易地扩展到其他矮星系。 <br /><br />总结: 通过Hubble Space Telescope对Draco矮椭圆星系进行了18年的成像分析，得出了有关该星系内部性质的多项重要结论，包括速度离散度的各向异性、暗物质密度斜率、距离和旋转。这些结果不仅对“尖峰-核心”问题进行了严格测试，还为其他矮星系的研究提供了重要的参考和启示。 <div>
We analyze four epochs of Hubble Space Telescope imaging over 18 yr for the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We measure precise proper motions for hundreds of stars and combine these with existing line-of-sight (LOS) velocities. This provides the first radially resolved 3D velocity dispersion profiles for any dwarf galaxy. These constrain the intrinsic velocity anisotropy and resolve the mass–anisotropy degeneracy. We solve the Jeans equations in oblate axisymmetric geometry to infer the mass profile. We find the velocity dispersion to be radially anisotropic along the symmetry axis and tangentially anisotropic in the equatorial plane, with a globally averaged value , (where 1 – in 3D). The logarithmic dark matter (DM) density slope over the observed radial range, Γdark, is , consistent with the inner cusp predicted in ΛCDM cosmology. As expected given Draco’s low mass and ancient star formation history, it does not appear to have been dissolved by baryonic processes. We rule out cores larger than 487, 717, and 942 pc at 1σ, 2σ, and 3σ confidence, respectively, thus imposing important constraints on the self-interacting DM cross section. Spherical models yield biased estimates for both the velocity anisotropy and the inferred slope. The circular velocity at our outermost data point (900 pc) is . We infer a dynamical distance of kpc and show that Draco has a modest LOS rotation, with . Our results provide a new stringent test of the so-called “cusp–core” problem that can be readily extended to other dwarfs.

<br /><br />总结:
这项研究使用Chandra-ACIS和XMM-Newton EPIC-pn仪器的高能拒绝率作为宇宙射线通量的代理，分析了2014年至2018年间的数据。研究发现，27天内有AMS质子通量与ACIS/EPIC-pn拒绝率之间的稳健相关性。然而，进一步观察发现了更短期的变化，ACIS和EPIC-pn拒绝率显示出大约25天和23天的重复变化。特别是在2016年至2017年期间，ACIS和EPIC-pn拒绝率还显示出了大约13.5天和9天的周期性。同时，研究还发现在2016年下半年AMS质子通量与ACIS/EPIC-pn拒绝率之间存在大约6天的时间滞后，而在2016年之前和2017年之后并未观察到这种现象。这些观察结果为宇宙射线对X射线天文台造成的影响提供了重要线索，进一步的物理机制研究仍在进行中。 <div>
Galactic cosmic-ray (GCR) particles have a significant impact on the particle-induced background of X-ray observatories, and their flux exhibits substantial temporal variability, potentially influencing background levels. In this study, we present 1 day binned high-energy reject rates derived from the Chandra-ACIS and XMM-Newton EPIC-pn instruments, serving as proxies for the GCR particle flux. We systematically analyze the ACIS and EPIC-pn reject rates and compare them with the AMS proton flux. Our analysis initially reveals robust correlations between the AMS proton flux and the ACIS/EPIC-pn reject rates when binned over 27 day intervals. However, a closer examination reveals substantial fluctuations within each 27 day bin, indicating shorter-term variability. Upon daily binning, we observe finer temporal structures in the data sets, demonstrating the presence of recurrent variations with periods of ∼25 days and 23 days in the ACIS and EPIC-pn reject rates, respectively, spanning the years 2014–2018. Notably, during the 2016–2017 period, we additionally detect periodicities of ∼13.5 days and 9 days in the ACIS and EPIC-pn reject rates, respectively. Intriguingly, we observe a time lag of ∼6 days between the AMS proton flux and the ACIS/EPIC-pn reject rates during the second half of 2016. This time lag is not visible before 2016 and after 2017. The underlying physical mechanisms responsible for this time lag remain a subject of ongoing investigation.

总结: 甲烷是寻找外星生命的重要生物迹象。在类似地球的外星球上，大气中甲烷含量受海洋生物生产和大气光化学反应的控制。研究发现水蒸气光解产生的羟基自由基对大气中甲烷含量的控制起着关键作用，尤其是当二氧化碳含量高时，太阳辐射在约200-210纳米波长是主要控制因素。这些发现对未来探测外星生命迹象提供了宝贵支持。特别是位于K型恒星宜居带外缘的外星球更适合甲烷积累。 <div>
Methane (CH4) is a primarily biogenic greenhouse gas. As such, it represents an essential biosignature to search for life on exoplanets. Atmospheric CH4 abundance on Earth-like inhabited exoplanets is likely controlled by marine biogenic production and atmospheric photochemical consumption. Such interactions have been previously examined for the case of the early Earth where primitive marine ecosystems supplied CH4 to the atmosphere, showing that the atmospheric CH4 response to biogenic CH4 flux variations is nonlinear, a critical property when assessing CH4 reliability as a biosignature. However, the contributions of atmospheric photochemistry, metabolic reactions, or solar irradiance to this nonlinear response are not well understood. Using an atmospheric photochemical model and a marine microbial ecosystem model, we show that the production of hydroxyl radicals from water vapor photodissociation is a critical factor controlling the atmospheric CH4 abundance. Consequently, atmospheric CH4 partial pressure (pCH4) on inhabited Earth-like exoplanets orbiting Sun-like stars (F-, G-, and K-type stars) would be controlled primarily by stellar irradiance. Specifically, irradiance at wavelengths of approximately 200–210 nm is a major controlling factor for atmospheric pCH4 when the carbon dioxide partial pressure is sufficiently high to absorb most stellar irradiance at 170–200 nm. Finally, we also demonstrated that inhabited exoplanets orbiting near the outer edge of K-type stars’ habitable zones are better suited for atmospheric pCH4 buildup. Such properties will provide valuable support for future detection of life signatures.

这篇文章介绍了关于z∼6-9星系流出现象的统计数据。通过分析JWST CEERS、GLASS和ERO数据中的61个经过光谱确认的星系，发现其中4个星系的[O III]+Hβ电离气体发射明显延伸到千秒差距尺度的恒星组分外部。与低红移星系相比，z∼6-9时期具有空间延伸气体的星系比例为4/18，比z∼0-1时期高一个数量级，这可能是由于在高红移时期频繁的主要并合事件触发了这种现象。此外，研究了30个z∼6-9星系的中等和高分辨率NIRSpec光谱，发现其中5个星系的[O III]禁线发射具有140-800 km/s的宽线，暗示存在星系流出现象。其中一个z=6.38的星系同时显示了空间延伸的气体发射和宽线，而没有一个具有明显的活动星系核的迹象，这表明星系流出主要是由恒星反馈驱动的。存在空间延伸气体发射或宽线的星系与没有这些现象的星系可能是由观测角度不同或这些星系处于高红移时期的早期、晚期或后期星系流出阶段所解释的，其中相对较大比例的这类星系表明在早期宇宙时期流出现象持续时间较长和/或更频繁。 <br /><br />总结: 通过分析z∼6-9时期的星系，发现了一些相对于低红移时期更为频繁的星系流出现象，这些流出现象主要由恒星反馈驱动，而不是活动星系核。这些发现将有助于我们更好地理解宇宙早期星系的形成和演化。 <div>
We present statistics of z ∼ 6–9 galaxy outflows indicated by spatially extended gas emission and broad lines. With a total of 61 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at z ∼ 6–9 in the JWST CEERS, GLASS, and ERO data, we find four galaxies with [O iii] + Hβ ionized gas emission significantly extended beyond the kiloparsec-scale stellar components on the basis of the emission line images constructed by the subtraction of NIRCam broadband (line on/off-band) images. By comparison with low-z galaxies, the fraction of galaxies with spatially extended gas, 4/18, at z ∼ 6–9 is an order of magnitude higher than that at z ∼ 0–1, which can be explained by events triggered by frequent major mergers at high redshift. We also investigate medium- and high-resolution NIRSpec spectra of 30 galaxies at z ∼ 6–9, and identify five galaxies with broad (140−800 km s−1) lines in the [O iii] forbidden line emission, suggestive of galaxy outflows. One galaxy at z = 6.38 shows both spatially extended gas emission and the broad lines, while none of the galaxies with spatially extended gas emission or broad lines present a clear signature of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in either the line diagnostics or type 1 AGN line broadening (>1000 km s−1), which suggests that outflows are mainly driven by stellar feedback. The existence of galaxies with/without spatially extended gas emission or broad lines may be explained by different viewing angles toward outflows or the fact that these are galaxies in the early, late, or post phases of galaxy outflows at high redshift, where relatively large fractions of such galaxies indicate longer-duration and/or more frequent outflows at early cosmic epochs.

Bubbles driven by energy and mass injection from small scales are ubiquitous in astrophysical fluid systems and essential to feedback across multiple scales. In particular, O stars in young clusters produce high-velocity winds that create hot bubbles in the surrounding gas. We demonstrate that the dynamical evolution of these bubbles is critically dependent upon the geometry of their interfaces with their surroundings and the nature of heat transport across these interfaces. These factors together determine the amount of energy that can be lost from the interior through cooling at the interface, which in turn determines the ability of the bubble to do work on its surroundings. We further demonstrate that the scales relevant to physical dissipation across this interface are extremely difficult to resolve in global numerical simulations of bubbles for parameter values of interest. This means the dissipation driving evolution of these bubbles in numerical simulations is often of a numerical nature. We describe the physical and numerical principles that determine the level of dissipation in these simulations; we use this, along with a fractal model for the geometry of the interfaces, to explain differences in convergence behavior between hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical simulations presented here. We additionally derive an expression for momentum as a function of bubble radius expected when the relevant dissipative scales are resolved and show that it still results in efficiently cooled solutions, as postulated in previous work.

The accelerated electrons during solar flares produce radio bursts and nonthermal X-ray signatures. The quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) and fine structures in spatial–spectral–temporal space in radio bursts depend on the emission mechanism and the local conditions, such as magnetic fields, electron density, and pitch-angle distribution. Radio burst observations with high-frequency time resolution imaging provide excellent diagnostics. In converging magnetic field geometries, the radio bursts can be produced via the electron cyclotron maser (ECM). Recently, using observations made by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at 1–2 GHz, Yu et al. reported a discovery of long-lasting auroral-like radio bursts persistent over a sunspot and interpreted them as ECM-generated emission. Here we investigate the detailed second and subsecond temporal variability of this continuous ECM source. We study the association of 5 s period QPPs with a concurrent GOES C1.5-class flare, utilizing VLA’s imaging spectroscopy capability with an extremely high temporal resolution (50 ms). We use the density and magnetic field extrapolation model to constrain the ECM emission to the second harmonic O-mode. Using the delay of QPPs from X-ray emission times, combined with X-ray spectroscopy and magnetic extrapolation, we constrain the energies and pitch angles of the ECM-emitting electrons to ≈4–8 keV and >26°. Our analysis shows that the loss-cone diffusion continuously fuels the ECM via Coulomb collisions and magnetic turbulence between a length scale of 5 and 100 Mm. We conclude that the QPP occurs via the Lotka–Volterra system, where the electrons from solar flares saturate the continuously operating ECM and cause temporary oscillations.

<div> 关键词: 磁流体动力学，阿尔文波，色球，太阳风，非理想MHD效应

总结:
这篇文章研究了色球中非理想磁流体动力学对太阳风的影响，通过进行阿尔文波驱动的MHD模拟，明确包括欧姆和等离子体扩散效应。发现色球中等离子体扩散显著地抑制了MHD波，进而使得达到日冕的阿尔文波的Poynting通量显著减少。因此，日冕温度和太阳风的质量损失率与理想MHD情况相比明显降低，这表明了太阳大气非理想MHD效应的重要性。然而，由于对等离子体扩散和阿尔文波反射对色球物理特性的敏感依赖，通过光球上对流产生的速度扰动轻微增加，温度和质量损失率得到了恢复。此外，还发现色球中阿尔文波的等离子体扩散抑制了在日冕的密度扰动产生，压缩性扰动的非线性生成被抑制。 <div>
We investigate nonideal magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) effects in the chromosphere on the solar wind by performing MHD simulations for Alfvén-wave-driven winds, explicitly including ohmic and ambipolar diffusion. We find that MHD waves are significantly damped in the chromosphere by ambipolar diffusion so that the Alfvénic Poynting flux that reaches the corona is substantially reduced. As a result, the coronal temperature and the mass-loss rate of the solar wind are considerably reduced, compared with those obtained from an ideal MHD case, which is indicative of the great importance of the nonideal MHD effects in the solar atmosphere. However, the temperature and the mass-loss rate are recovered by a small increase in the convection-originated velocity perturbation at the photosphere because of the sensitive dependence of the ambipolar diffusion and reflection of Alfvén waves on the physical properties of the chromosphere. We also find that density perturbations in the corona are reduced by the ambipolar diffusion of Alfvén waves in the chromosphere because the nonlinear generation of compressible perturbations is suppressed.

<div> 全球盘模型，线性和非线性COS（对流超稳定性）的研究，大规模、长寿命的涡流，自由角动量传输，尘埃动力学和行星形成。<br /><br />总结:
这篇文章研究了全球盘模型中的COS（对流超稳定性），发现线性COS模式存在于径向Lindblad共振（LR）的内侧。然后进行了轴对称全局模拟，发现非线性饱和类似于以前的不可压缩剪切箱模拟。在3D非轴对称全局模拟中，发现COS产生大规模、长寿命的涡流，通过激发螺旋密度波来传输角动量。此外，COS通常产生向外的径向质量输运。这些发现对于行星形成和解释原行星盘中观测到的尘埃环和不对称性可能有重要意义。 <div>
Protoplanetary disks are prone to several hydrodynamic instabilities. One candidate, convective overstability (COS), can drive radial semiconvection that may influence dust dynamics and planetesimal formation. However, the COS has primarily been studied in local models. This paper investigates the COS near the midplane of radially global disk models. We first conduct a global linear stability analysis, which shows that linear COS modes exist only radially inward of their Lindblad resonance (LR). The fastest-growing modes have LRs near the inner radial domain boundary with effective radial wavelengths that can be a substantial fraction of the disk radius. We then perform axisymmetric global simulations and find that the COS’s nonlinear saturation is similar to previous incompressible shearing box simulations. In particular, we observe the onset of persistent zonal and elevator flows for sufficiently steep radial entropy gradients. In full 3D, nonaxisymmetric global simulations, we find the COS produces large-scale, long-lived vortices, which induce the outward radial transport of angular momentum via the excitation of spiral density waves. The corresponding α-viscosity values of order 10−3 agree well with those found in previous 3D compressible shearing box simulations. However, in global disks, significant modifications to their radial structure are found, including the formation of pressure bumps. Interestingly, the COS typically generates an outward radial mass transport, i.e., decretion. We briefly discuss the possible implications of our results for planetesimal formation and for interpreting dust rings and asymmetries observed in protoplanetary disks.

<div> 关键词: JWST, 星系, 临界质量, 连续星形成, 过程压制

总结: 本文利用JWST对z≳8的星系进行观测，发现它们比大多数模型预测的更明亮、更杂乱，引发了对第一代星系中星形成和反馈物理的多个新提议。本文重点探讨了紫外辐射在调节星形成中的作用，通过一系列宇宙射线流体动力学模拟，发现远紫外辐射对形成致密且大质量星团的抑制冷却过程具有主要影响，同时也是造成z≳10金属贫穷星系中爆发式星形成的物理过程。由于强烈的远紫外场，低金属云体保持温暖直到达到相对较高密度之前变为自遮蔽状态，并转变为较冷的部分分子相。因此星形成被延迟，直到云体累积足够的质量变得不稳定。在这一点上，云体经历快速星形成，高效地将气体转化为星体。因此我们观察到了异常明亮的星系（比连续星形成明亮10倍），以及后来停止形成星体几千万年的「死」星系。 <br /><br /> <div>
JWST observations of galaxies at z ≳ 8 suggest that they are more luminous and clumpier than predicted by most models, prompting several proposals on the physics of star formation and feedback in the first galaxies. In this paper, we focus on the role of ultraviolet (UV) radiation in regulating star formation by performing a set of cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations of one galaxy at subparsec resolution with different radiative feedback models. We find that the suppression of cooling by far-UV (FUV) radiation (i.e., H2 dissociating radiation) from Population II stars is the main physical process triggering the formation of compact and massive star clusters and is responsible for the bursty star formation observed in metal-poor galaxies at z ≳ 10. Indeed, artificially suppressing FUV radiation leads to a less intense continuous mode of star formation distributed into numerous but low-mass open star clusters. Due to the intense FUV field, low-metallicity clouds remain warm (∼104 K) until they reach a relatively high density (≳103 cm−3), before becoming self-shielded and transitioning to a colder (∼100 K), partially molecular phase. As a result, star formation is delayed until the clouds accumulate enough mass to become gravitationally unstable. At this point, the clouds undergo rapid star formation, converting gas into stars with high efficiency. We therefore observe exceptionally bright galaxies (10 times brighter than for continuous star formation) and subsequent quenched “dead” galaxies that did not form stars for tens of Myr.

Cool red giant stars exhibit absorption bands of calcium monochloride (CaCl) in the optical region. In this work, the bands of CaCl corresponding to the A2Π − X2Σ+ transition with 4 and v″ ≤ 4, and B2Σ+ − X2Σ+ transition with 2 and v″ ≤ 2 are rotationally analyzed with PGOPHER, a multipurpose program for simulating and fitting molecular spectra. All bands were analyzed using high-resolution absorption spectra collected at the National Solar Observatory in 1985, calibrated with atomic lines from a high-resolution emission spectrum obtained in a separate hollow cathode experiment. The results are compared with previous laser-induced fluorescence measurements. Overall, the accuracy of spectroscopic constants for the A2Π and B2Σ+ states is improved. Scaled transition dipole moment calculations were used to obtain line strengths. Line lists are provided with Einstein A coefficients and oscillator strengths, which can be used to determine CaCl stellar abundances. Additionally, isotope splittings allowed us to estimate band origins for the 40Ca37Cl isotopologue based on band-head positions.

The precise measurement of neutron star (NS) spins can provide important insight into the formation and evolution of compact binaries containing NSs. While traditional methods of NS spin measurement rely on pulsar observations, gravitational-wave detections offer a complementary avenue. However, determining component spins with gravitational waves is hindered by the small dimensionless spins of the NSs and the degeneracy in the mass and spin parameters. This degeneracy can be addressed by the inclusion of higher-order modes in the waveform, which are important for systems with unequal masses. This study shows the suitability of NS–black hole mergers, which are naturally mass-asymmetric, for precise NS spin measurements. We explore the effects of the black hole masses and spins, higher-mode content, inclination angles, and detector sensitivity on the measurement of NS spin. We find that networks with next-generation observatories like the Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope can distinguish NS dimensionless spin of 0.04 (0.1) from zero at 1σ confidence for events within ∼350 (∼1000) Mpc. Networks with A+ and A♯ detectors achieve similar distinction within ∼30 (∼70) Mpc and ∼50 (∼110) Mpc, respectively.

<title>Single-epoch and Differential Astrometric Microlensing of Quasars</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We propose and discuss a new experimental approach to measure the centroid shift induced by gravitational microlensing in the images of lensed quasars (astrometric microlensing). Our strategy is based on taking the photocenter of a region in the quasar large enough as to be insensitive to microlensing as reference to measure the centroid displacement of the continuum. In this way, single-epoch measurements of astrometric microlensing can be performed. Using numerical simulations, we show that, indeed, the centroid shift monotonically decreases as the size of the emitting region increases, and only for relatively large regions, like the broad line region (BLR), does the centroid shift become negligible. This opens interesting possibilities to study the stratification of the different emitters in the accretion disk and the BLR. We estimate the amplitude of the centroid shifts for 79 gravitationally lensed images and study more thoroughly the special cases Q2237+030 A, RXJ1131-1231 A, PG1115+080 A2, and SDSS J1004+4112 A. We propose to use spectro-astrometry to simultaneously obtain the photocenters of the continuum and of different emission line regions since, with the precision of forthcoming instruments, astrometric microlensing by ∼1 M⊙ mass microlenses may be detected in many quasar lensed images. When we consider more massive micro/millilenses, M ≳ 10 M⊙, often proposed as the constituents of dark matter, the BLR becomes sensitive to microlensing and can no longer be used as a positional reference to measure centroid shifts. Differential microlensing between the images of a lensed quasar along several epochs should be used instead.

<title>Multiwavelength Emission of the Gamma-Ray Burst Prompt Phase. I. Time-resolved and Time-integrated Polarizations</title>

The time-integrated polarization degree (PD) in the prompt optical band of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) was predicted to be less than 20%, while the time-resolved one can reach as high as 75% in the photosphere model. Polarizations in the optical band during the GRB prompt phase have not previously been studied in the framework of the magnetic reconnection model. Here, a three-segment power law of the energy spectrum is used to reconstruct the Stokes parameters of the magnetic reconnection model. Multiwavelength light curves and polarization curves from the optical band to MeV gamma rays in the GRB prompt phase are studied. We found that, depending mainly on the jet dynamics, there is a long-lasting high-PD phase in all calculated energy bands for the typical parameter sets. The time-resolved PD could be as high as 50%, while the time-integrated one is roughly 17% in the optical band. The time-resolved PD in X-rays can reach 60% and the time-integrated one is around 30%–40%. The evolution of polarization angle (PA) is random in both optical and gamma-ray bands for the photosphere model, while it is roughly constant in the synchrotron models. Therefore, future time-resolved PA observations in the prompt optical or gamma-ray band could distinguish between the photosphere and synchrotron models.

<title>Possible Supercritical Accretion on the Ultraluminous X-Ray Source in the Metal-poor Galaxy I Zw 18</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present an analysis of X-ray observations of the ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) in I Zw 18 based on archival data taken with Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Suzaku. This ULX is considered to be an intermediate-mass black hole candidate simply because it is in the lowest-metallicity environment among ULXs, where the formation of heavy black holes is facilitated. However, actual study of the ULX based on observations spanning for a long period has been too limited to determine its nature. In this study, we investigate the spectral evolution of the ULX up to 2014, combining the previously unpublished Suzaku data with those from the other two satellites. We derive a positive correlation of between the bolometric luminosity L and inner-disk temperature Tin on the basis of the multicolor disk blackbody model, where we exclude the Chandra data, which have the lowest luminosity and systematic residuals in the fitting. The nominal relation for the standard disk is rejected at a significance level of 1.5%. These results suggest that the ULX was in the slim-disk state during these observations except at the time of the Chandra observation, in which the ULX was likely to be in a different state. The apparent inner-disk radius appears negatively correlated with the inner-disk temperature. Moreover, we find a radial dependence of the disk temperature of T(r) ∝ r−p with p < 0.75, which also supports the hypothesis that the ULX has a slim disk. Therefore, the I Zw 18 ULX is most likely to be powered by a stellar-mass compact object in supercritical accretion.

<title>The Impact of the Explicit Representation of Convection on the Climate of a Tidally Locked Planet in Global Stretched-mesh Simulations</title>

Convective processes are crucial in shaping exoplanetary atmospheres but are computationally expensive to simulate directly. A novel technique of simulating moist convection on tidally locked exoplanets is to use a global 3D model with a stretched mesh. This allows us to locally refine the model resolution to 4.7 km and resolve fine-scale convective processes without relying on parameterizations. We explore the impact of mesh stretching on the climate of a slowly rotating TRAPPIST-1e-like planet, assuming it is 1:1 tidally locked. In the stretched-mesh simulation with explicit convection, the climate is 5 K colder and 25% drier than that in the simulations with parameterized convection(with both stretched and quasi-uniform meshes). This is due to the increased cloud reflectivity—because of an increase in low-level cloudiness—and exacerbated by the diminished greenhouse effect due to less water vapor. At the same time, our stretched-mesh simulations reproduce the key characteristics of the global climate of tidally locked rocky exoplanets, without any noticeable numerical artifacts. Our methodology opens an exciting and computationally feasible avenue for improving our understanding of 3D mixing in exoplanetary atmospheres. Our study also demonstrates the feasibility of a global stretched-mesh configuration for LFRic-Atmosphere, the next-generation Met Office climate and weather model.

<title>The Peculiar Precursor of a Gamma-Ray Burst from a Binary Merger Involving a Magnetar</title>

The milestone discovery of GW170817-GRB 170817A-AT 2017gfo has shown that gravitational waves (GWs) could be produced during the merger of a neutron star–neutron star/black hole and that in electromagnetic (EM) waves, a gamma-ray burst (GRB) and a kilonova (KN) are generated in sequence after the merger. Observationally, however, EM properties before the merger phase are still unclear. Here we report a peculiar precursor in a KN-associated long-duration GRB 211211A, providing evidence of the EM before the merger. This precursor lasts ∼0.2 s, and the waiting time between the precursor and the main burst is ∼1 s, comparable to that between GW170817 and GRB 170817A. The spectrum of the precursor could be well fit with a nonthermal cutoff power-law model instead of a blackbody. In particular, a ∼22 Hz quasiperiodic oscillation candidate (∼3σ) is detected in the precursor. These temporal and spectral properties indicate that this precursor is probably produced by a catastrophic flare accompanied with magnetoelastic or crustal oscillations of a magnetar in a binary compact merger. The strong magnetic field of the magnetar can also account for the prolonged duration of GRB 211211A. However, it poses a challenge to reconcile the rather short lifetime of a magnetar with the rather long spiraling time of a binary neutron star system only by the GW radiation before the merger.

<title>Very Long Baseline Interferometry Detection of an Active Radio Source Potentially Driving 100 kpc Scale Emission in the Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxy IRAS F01004–2237</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) IRAS F01004−2237 exhibits 100 kpc scale continuum emission at radio wavelengths. The absence of extended X-ray emission in IRAS F01004−2237 has suggested an active galactic nucleus (AGN) origin for the extended radio emission, whose properties and role in merging systems still need to be better understood. We present the results of multifrequency observations of IRAS F01004−2237 conducted by the Very Long Baseline Array at 2.3 and 8.4 GHz. Compact 8.4 GHz continuum emission was detected on a 1 pc scale in the nuclear region with an intrinsic brightness temperature of 108.1 K suggesting that the radio source originated from an AGN, potentially driving the extended emission. In contrast, no significant emission was observed at 2.3 GHz, indicating the presence of low-frequency absorption. This absorption cannot be attributed solely to synchrotron self-absorption; alternatively, free–free absorption due to thermal plasma is mainly at work in the spectrum. From combined perspectives, including mid-infrared and X-ray data, the AGN is obscured in a dense environment. The kinetic power of the nonthermal jet, as inferred from the extended emission, can play a more important role in dispersing the surrounding medium than the thermal outflow in IRAS F01004−2237. These findings hint that jet activities in ULIRGs may contribute to AGN feedback during galaxy evolution induced by merger events.

<title>Progenitor Constraint-incorporating Shell Merger: The Case of Supernova Remnant G359.0–0.9</title>

It is generally hard to put robust constraints on progenitor masses of supernovae and supernova remnants (SNRs) observationally, while they offer tantalizing clues to understanding explosion mechanisms and mass distribution. Our recent study suggests that “shell merger,” which is theoretically expected for stellar evolution, can appreciably affect the final yields of intermediate-mass elements (IMEs; such as Ne, Mg, and Si). In light of this, here we report the results of the X-ray spectral analysis of a Galactic SNR G359.0−0.9, whose abundance pattern may possibly be anomalous according to a previous study. Our spectroscopy using all the available data taken with XMM-Newton reveals that this remnant is classified as a Mg-rich SNR because of its high Mg-to-Ne ratio ( mass ratio ) and conclude that the result cannot be explained without the shell merger. By comparing the observation with theoretical calculations, we prefer the so-called Ne-burning shell intrusion and in this case, the progenitor mass MZAMS is likely <15M⊙. We confirm the result also with our new molecular-line observations with the Nobeyama 45 m telescope: G359.0−0.9 is located in the Scutum–Centaurus arm (2.66–2.94 kpc) and in this case, the resultant total ejecta mass ∼6.8M⊙ is indeed consistent with the above estimate. Our method using mass ratios of IMEs presented in this paper will become useful to distinguish the type of shell merger, the Ne-burning shell intrusion, and the O-burning shell merger, for future SNR studies.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The dispersion relation of the magnetized Kelvin–Helmholtz (KH) instability driven by shear flow with zero thickness of the shear layer is derived theoretically based on a set of magnetohydrodynamic equations in the presence of a transverse magnetic field and a radiation field. The influence of the magnetic field strength, the radiation field strength, and the density ratio of the two sides of the shear layer on KH instability is analyzed by solving the dispersion equation. The results indicate that the presence of radiation and transverse magnetic fields can destabilize the KH instability due to the resulting increase in Mach number, which in turn reduces the compressibility of the system. Also, the extent of the destabilizing effect of the magnetic field can be affected by the magnetoacoustic Mach number M1f and the Mach number M2. The growth rates vary more significantly for relatively small values of both parameters. Finally, the stabilizing effect of a large density ratio is considered, and it is found that as the density ratio increases, the effect of the radiation field is more significant at larger Mach number M2. These results can be applied to astrophysical phenomena with velocity shear, such as flows across the transition layer between an H ii region and a molecular cloud, accretion flows, and shear flows of cosmic plasmas.

<title>On the Interacting/Active Lifetime of Supernova Fallback Disks around Isolated Neutron Stars</title>

The fallback disk model is widely accepted to explain long-period neutron stars (NSs) that cannot be simulated by magnetic dipole radiation. However, there was no confirmed detection of disks from the newly discovered long-period pulsars GLEAM-X 162759.5-523504.3 and GPM J1839-10 and the slowest known isolated NS 1E 161348-5055. This might be because the disks have either been in a noninteracting/inactive state where their emission is too weak to be detected or have been disrupted. In this work, we conduct simulations to examine the lifetime of supernova fallback disks around isolated NSs. We assume that the disks' mass varies in a self-similar way, and their interaction with the NS occurs only in an interacting/active state. Our results reveal that nearly all the interacting lifetimes for the disks are shorter than 105 yr, while the existence lifetimes are considerably longer.

Space scientists often face the question of whether data collected by different instruments are measurements of the same source population. This paper proposes a statistical validation method for evaluating the agreement between such related data sets. It offers a detailed case study focused on validating a new data set from the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) mission, which serves as a practical how-to guide for similar analyses. Since 2008, the IBEX satellite has been gathering data on heliospheric energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) while being exposed to various sources of background noise, such as cosmic rays and solar energetic particles. The IBEX mission initially released only a qualified triple-coincidence (qABC) data product, which was designed to provide observations of ENAs free of background contamination. Further measurements revealed that the qABC data were in fact susceptible to contamination, having relatively low ENA counts and high background rates. To mitigate this issue, the mission team recently considered releasing a certain qualified double-coincidence (qBC) data product, which has roughly twice the detection rate of the qABC data product. This paper presents a simulation-based validation of the new qBC data product against the already-released qABC data product. The results show that the qBCs can plausibly be said to be measuring the same source population as the qABCs up to an average absolute deviation of 3.6%. Visual diagnostics provide additional confirmation of source rate coherence across data products. The framework introduced here is general and can be applied to other validation problems both within and outside the field of space physics.

<div> Spitzer, Herschel, Wolf–Rayet, 小麦哲伦星云, 气体发射线
总结:
本研究使用Spitzer和Herschel望远镜对小麦哲伦星云内的Wolf–Rayet星云N76进行了观测，并利用Cloudy模型对红外发射线进行建模。我们发现N76的物理条件为热HII区，电子温度最高可达2.4万K，电子密度在4至12cm-3之间，具有高离化参数。我们的模型表明，大部分的[Si ii]发射是在H ii区边缘产生的，而[O iii]和[Ne iii]等高电离线则主要由恒星风产生。通过分析低金属量的WR星云，本研究为了解WR星对邻近矮星系中离子化气体性质的影响提供了宝贵的见解。 <div>
We present Cloudy modeling of infrared emission lines in the Wolf–Rayet (WR) nebula N76 caused by one of the most luminous and hottest WR stars in the low metallicity Small Magellanic Cloud. We use spatially resolved mid-infrared Spitzer/InfRared Spectrograph and far-infrared Herschel/PACS spectroscopy to establish the physical conditions of the ionized gas. The spatially resolved distribution of the emission allows us to constrain properties much more accurately than using spatially integrated quantities. We construct models with a range of constant hydrogen densities between nH = 4–10 cm−3 and a stellar wind-blown cavity of 10 pc, which reproduces the intensity and shape of most ionized gas emission lines, including the high ionization lines [O iv] and [Ne v], as well as [S iii], [S iv], [O iii], and [Ne iii]. Our models suggest that the majority of [Si ii] emission (91%) is produced at the edge of the H ii region around the transition between ionized and atomic gas while very little of the [C ii] (<5%) is associated with the ionized gas. The physical conditions of N76 are characterized by a hot HII region with a maximum electron temperature of Te ∼ 24,000 K, electron densities that range from ne ∼ 4 to 12 cm−3, and high ionization parameters of By analyzing a low-metallicity WR nebula with a single ionization source, this work gives valuable insights into the impact WR stars have on the galaxy-integrated ionized gas properties in nearby dwarf galaxies.

<div> X-ray binaries, star formation rates, stellar masses, metallicity, NGC 300
总结: 本文研究了星系外X射线双星的人口学特性和人口统计学特征与宿主星系的恒星形成率、恒星质量和金属丰度之间的相关性。研究发现X射线双星的比例关系可能取决于金属丰度和恒星年龄，但在亚星系尺度上，金属丰度和恒星年龄对其影响仍然存在挑战。研究使用NGC 300的 X射线和红外观测数据进行自洽建模，检查其X射线双星的径向分布趋势；测得当前的恒星形成率为0.18 ± 0.08 M⊙ yr−1，恒星质量为M⋆ = M⊙。研究发现在约1037 erg s−1以下的X射线源存在明显过剩，可能为变星X射线双星和额外的背景活动星系核。对比文献中的整体X射线双星比例关系，发现只有年龄最年轻的区域与预测相符，提示X射线双星比例关系可能存在时间演化。 <div>
The population-wide properties and demographics of extragalactic X-ray binaries (XRBs) correlate with the star formation rates (SFRs), stellar masses (M⋆), and environmental factors (such as metallicity, Z) of their host galaxy. Although there is evidence that XRB scaling relations (LX/SFR for high-mass XRBs (HMXBs) and LX/M⋆ for low-mass XRBs) may depend on metallicity and stellar age across large samples of XRB-hosting galaxies, disentangling the effects of metallicity and stellar age from stochastic effects, particularly on subgalactic scales, remains a challenge. We use archival X-ray through IR observations of the nearby galaxy NGC 300 to self-consistently model the broadband spectral energy distribution and examine radial trends in its XRB population. We measure a current (<100 Myr) SFR of 0.18 ± 0.08 M⊙ yr−1 and stellar mass M⋆ = M⊙. Although we measure a metallicity gradient and radially resolved star formation histories that are consistent with the literature, there is a clear excess in the number of X-ray sources below ∼1037 erg s−1 that are likely a mix of variable XRBs and additional background active galactic nuclei. When we compare the subgalactic LX/SFR ratios as a function of Z to the galaxy-integrated LX-SFR-Z relationships from the literature, we find that only the regions hosting the youngest (≲30 Myr) HMXBs agree with predictions, hinting at time evolution of the LX–SFR–Z relationship.

We conduct one-dimensional stellar-evolution simulations of stars with zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) masses of MZAMS = 8.8 − 9.45 M⊙ toward core collapse by electron capture and find that the convective zone of the precollapse core can supply the required stochastic angular momentum fluctuations to set a jet-driven electron capture supernova explosion in the frame of the jittering jets explosion mechanism. By our assumed criteria of a minimum convective specific angular momentum and an accreted mass during jet launching of Macc ≃ 0.001−0.01 M⊙, the layer in the convective zone that when accreted launches the exploding jittering jets resides in the helium-rich zone. Depending on the model, this exploding layer is accreted at about a minute to a few hours after core collapse occurs, much shorter than the time the exploding shock crosses the star. The final (gravitational) mass of the neutron star (NS) remnant is in the range of MNS = 1.25−1.43 M⊙.

<div> 高红移类星体、光谱、中性气体分数、神经网络、仿真模型
总结:
在这项研究中，研究人员使用了18个红移在6.0 < z < 7.1的类星体光谱来填补6 ≲ z ≲ 7之间的中性气体分数空白。他们运用神经网络重构类星体的连续辐射，对光谱进行规范化处理，然后将这些规范化后的光谱分为三个红移区间进行叠加。通过比较两种流体动力学模拟（ATON和CROC）中的模型，他们测量了平均中性气体分数，并同时拟合了每个叠加光谱的平均类星体寿命。他们发现中性气体分数在不同红移区间发生了变化，而平均类星体寿命约为7百万年，这与先前的研究结果相吻合。 <div>
The spectra of high-redshift (z ≳ 6) quasars contain valuable information on the progression of the Epoch of Reionization. At redshifts z < 6, the observed Lyman-series forest shows that the intergalactic medium is nearly ionized, while at z > 7 the observed quasar damping wings indicate high neutral gas fractions. However, there remains a gap in neutral gas fraction constraints at 6 ≲ z ≲ 7 where the Lyman-series forest becomes saturated but damping wings have yet to fully emerge. In this work, we use a sample of 18 quasar spectra at redshifts 6.0 < z < 7.1 to close this gap. We apply neural networks to reconstruct the quasars’ continuum emission around the partially absorbed Lyα line to normalize their spectra, and stack these continuum-normalized spectra in three redshift bins. To increase the robustness of our results, we compare the stacks to a grid of models from two hydrodynamical simulations, ATON and CROC, and we measure the volume-averaged neutral gas fraction, , while jointly fitting for the mean quasar lifetime, tQ, for each stacked spectrum. We chronicle the evolution of neutral gas fraction using the ATON (CROC) models as follows: ( ) at 〈z〉 = 6.10, ( ) at 〈z〉 = 6.46, and ( ) at 〈z〉 = 6.87. At the same time, we constrain the average quasar lifetime to be tQ ≲ 7 Myr across all redshift bins, in good agreement with previous studies.

We estimate the neutrino flux from different kinds of galactic sources and compare it with the recent diffuse neutrino flux detected by IceCube. We find that the flux from these sources may contribute to ∼20% of the IceCube neutrino flux. Most of the sources selected in this work populate the southern hemisphere, therefore a detector like KM3NeT could help in resolving the sources out of the observed diffused galactic neutrino flux.

<div> Wolf-Rayet stars, massive stars, binary merger, formation channels, population synthesis
<br /><br />总结:
Wolf-Rayet（W-R）星是非常重要的大质量恒星。通过模拟，我们发现双星合并是W-R恒星形成的重要途径，能够解释观测到的W-R恒星总体比例。我们的模型大致能够复现银河系W-R恒星的观测分布，但对大麦哲伦星云的观测分布解释不足。进行解释时，我们考虑了在双星合并过程中可能低估了质量损失率。 <div>
Wolf–Rayet (W-R) stars are very important massive stars. However, their origin and the observed binary fraction within the entire W-R population are still debated. We investigate some possible merger channels for the formation of W-R stars, including main sequence (MS)/Hertzsprung gap (HG) + MS, He + HG/giant branch (GB). We find that many products produced via binary merger can evolve into W-R stars, the MS/HG + MS merger channel can explain W-R stars with luminosities higher than ∼105.4L⊙, while the He + HG/GB merger channel can explain low-luminosity W-R stars in the range of 104.7L⊙ ∼ 105.5L⊙. In the population synthesis analysis of W-R stars, we assume an initial binary fraction (fini,bin) of 50% and 100% for massive stars. We also assume that MS/HG + MS merger products are nonrotating or rapidly rotating (ω/ωcrit = 0.8). In different cases, the calculated single fractions of W-R stars range from 22.2%–60.6% in the Milky Way (MW) and from 8.3%–70.9% in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The current observations fall within the range of our calculations. When the merger product of MS/HG + MS rotates rapidly, we estimate that there are approximately 1015–1396 W-R stars in the MW and 128–204 W-R stars in the LMC. Our model also roughly reproduces the observed single-peak luminosity distribution of W-R stars in the MW. However, the weak bimodal luminosity distribution observed in the LMC is not reproduced in our model. We assess that this may be due to the model underestimating the mass-loss rate in the LMC. In conclusion, we consider that the binary merger is a significant formation channel for W-R formation, and can explain the observed high fraction of the single W-R stars in the total population.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了外行星的形成理论，指出核心和鹅卵石聚集对岩石和冰行星的形成有影响，但还需要考虑气盘引力不稳定对M-矮星巨行星和远距离行星的影响。新模型提高了空间分辨率和采用了β冷却逼近，发现GDGI可以解释在离心轨道上（离心率小于0.2）形成距离约30到50天文单位的巨行星。随着原恒星质量减少至0.1太阳质量，形成的数量降至0。 <div>
Exoplanet demographics are sufficiently advanced to provide important constraints on theories of planet formation. While core and pebble accretion are preferred for rocky and icy planets, there appears to be a need for gas disk gravitational instability (GDGI) to play a role in the formation of M-dwarf gas giants and those orbiting at large distances. Here we present GDGI models that go beyond those presented by Boss (2011) dealing with the formation of wide-orbit gas giants. The new models use quadrupled spatial resolution, in both the radial and azimuthal directions, to reduce the effects of finite spatial resolution. The new models also employ the β cooling approximation, instead of the diffusion approximation used by Boss (2011), in order to push the models further in time. As in Boss (2011), the central protostars have masses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 M⊙, surrounded by disks with masses ranging from 0.019 M⊙ to 0.21 M⊙. For each case, two models are computed, one with an initial minimum Toomre Q stability value ranging from 1.1 to 1.7, and one with a higher initial disk temperature, resulting in the initial minimum Q ranging from 2.2 to 3.4. These new models continue to show that GDGI can explain the formation of gas giants at distances of ∼30 to ∼50 au on eccentric orbits (e less than ∼0.2), though the number formed drops to 0 as the protostar mass decreases to 0.1 M⊙.

总结: 
本文讨论了太阳圈模型面临的重要挑战，即缺乏对太阳全面观测的数据。文章提出了利用STEREO观测到的He ii 304 Å发射来获得太阳背面磁通量的新技术。研究通过比较模型预测的原位测量值与实际测量值发现，尽管存在一些数量上的差异，但这些差异远远小于太阳圈模型与实际观测数据之间的总体差异。然而，结果表明，那些显著改变开放通量与闭合通量以及总通量比值的活跃区域将对预测的原位测量结果产生最大的影响。 <br /><br /> <div>
A significant challenge facing heliospheric models is the lack of full Sun observational coverage. The lack of information about the farside photospheric magnetic field necessitates the use of various techniques to approximate the structure and appearance of this field. However, a recently developed technique that uses He ii 304 Å emission observed by the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) enables developing a magnetic flux proxy by imaging of active regions on the far side of the Sun. Incorporating information about these active regions on the far side of the Sun may have the potential to drastically improve heliospheric models. In this work, we run multiple heliospheric models with and without farside information obtained from STEREO observations of He ii 304 Å emission and compare the predicted in situ measurements from the models with real in situ data from STEREO and Earth. We find that although there are noticeable quantitative differences between the in situ predictions from the two models, they are dwarfed by the overall disagreement between the heliospheric model and the actual in situ data. Nevertheless, our results indicate that active regions that significantly change the ratio of open-to-closed and open-to-total flux create the biggest change in the predicted in situ measurements.

Based on the Insight-HXMT archival data, we have detected a new atypical low-frequency quasiperiodic oscillation (LFQPO) in the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1348−630. The new LFQPO is detected in all three instruments of Insight-HXMT with a combined significance of 3σ–5σ, covering a wide energy range of 1–100 keV. The fractional rms seems to decrease with energy. It exclusively appears in the hard state during both the main and mini outburst, spanning an X-ray intensity range by a factor of 10, and a very narrow hardness range. The frequency of this new type of LFQPO is moderately stable, in the range of 0.08–0.15 Hz. We discussed different models for the LFQPO, and found none can explain the observed properties of this new type of LFQPO.

In 2021, a catalog of 536 fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) radio telescope was released by the CHIME/FRB Collaboration. This large collection of bursts, observed with a single instrument and uniform selection effects, has advanced our understanding of the FRB population. Here we update the results for 140 of these FRBs for which channelized raw voltage (“baseband”) data are available. With the voltages measured by the telescope’s antennas, it is possible to maximize the telescope sensitivity in any direction within the primary beam, an operation called “beamforming.” This allows us to increase the signal-to-noise ratios of the bursts and to localize them to subarcminute precision. The improved localizations are also used to correct the beam response of the instrument and to measure fluxes and fluences with an ∼10% uncertainty. Additionally, the time resolution is increased by 3 orders of magnitude relative to that in the first CHIME/FRB catalog, and, applying coherent dedispersion, burst morphologies can be studied in detail. Polarization information is also available for the full sample of 140 FRBs, providing an unprecedented data set to study the polarization properties of the population. We release the baseband data beamformed to the most probable position of each FRB. These data are analyzed in detail in a series of accompanying papers.

Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental process for releasing magnetic energy in space physics and astrophysics. At present, the usual way to investigate the reconnection process is through analytical studies or first-principle numerical simulations. This paper is the first to understand the turbulent magnetic reconnection process by exploring the nature of magnetic turbulence. From the perspective of radio synchrotron polarization statistics, we study how to recover the properties of the turbulent magnetic field by considering the line of sight along different directions of the reconnection layer. We find that polarization intensity statistics can reveal the spectral properties of reconnection turbulence. This work opens up a new way of understanding turbulent magnetic reconnection.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了天体物理环境的化学特性和动力学之间的密切关系，强调了对这些环境进行3D建模的必要性。然而，在3D流体动力学模拟中解决化学动力学是计算上不可行的。作者提出了一种名为mace的机器学习方法来模拟动态环境中的化学反应，通过使用自动编码器和一组潜在的常微分方程来降低化学网络的维度并对其进行时间演化。通过在PyTorch中高效实现，mace的性能优于传统方法约26倍，并且在计算上具有次线性的可扩展性。这种方法对于包括AGB喷流在内的天体物理环境的3D化学动力学模拟具有重要的应用潜力。 <div>
The chemistry of an astrophysical environment is closely coupled to its dynamics, the latter often found to be complex. Hence, to properly model these environments a 3D context is necessary. However, solving chemical kinetics within a 3D hydro simulation is computationally infeasible for even a modest parameter study. In order to develop a feasible 3D hydro-chemical simulation, the classical chemical approach needs to be replaced by a faster alternative. We present mace, a Machine-learning Approach to Chemistry Emulation, as a proof-of-concept work on emulating chemistry in a dynamical environment. Using the context of AGB outflows, we have developed an architecture that combines the use of an autoencoder (to reduce the dimensionality of the chemical network) and a set of latent ordinary differential equations (that are solved to perform the temporal evolution of the reduced features). Training this architecture with an integrated scheme makes it possible to successfully reproduce a full chemical pathway in a dynamical environment. mace outperforms its classical analog on average by a factor of 26. Furthermore, its efficient implementation in PyTorch results in a sublinear scaling with respect to the number of hydrodynamical simulation particles.

FIREPLACE调查的第二个数据发布（DR2）覆盖了中分子区域（CMZ）的热极化尘埃发射观测结果，发现磁场取向呈双峰分布，并观察到磁场取向与分子云的总强度形态有关。受恒星风和潮汐力的影响，磁场结构呈现出明显的空间变化。总结：<br />该调查利用高分辨率机载宽带相机在214微米波段观测了CMZ区域的热极化尘埃发射。通过对DR2和DR1数据进行处理，获得了约64,000个极化伪矢量，发现磁场取向呈双峰分布，且与其他研究结果相似。同时观察到磁场取向与分子云的总强度形态有关，且受到恒星风和潮汐力的影响。 <div>
We present the second data release (DR2) of the Far-InfraREd Polarimetric Large-Area CMZ Exploration (FIREPLACE) survey. This survey utilized the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy High-resolution Airborne Wideband Camera plus instrument at 214 μm (E band) at a resolution of 19.″6 to observe thermal polarized dust emission throughout the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). DR2 consists of observations obtained in 2022 covering the region of the CMZ extending from the Brick to the Sgr C molecular clouds (corresponding to a 1° × 0.°75 region of the sky). We combine DR2 with the first FIREPLACE data release (DR1) to obtain full coverage of the CMZ (a 1.°5 × 0.°75 region of the sky). After applying total and polarized intensity significance cuts on the full FIREPLACE data set, we obtain ∼64,000 Nyquist-sampled polarization pseudovectors. The distribution of polarization pseudovectors confirms a bimodal distribution in the CMZ magnetic field orientations, recovering field components that are oriented predominantly parallel or perpendicular to the Galactic plane. This distribution of orientations is similar to what was observed in DR1 and other studies. We also inspect the magnetic fields toward a set of prominent CMZ molecular clouds (the Brick, Three Little Pigs, 50 and 20 km s−1 clouds, circumnuclear disk, CO 0.02-0.02, and Sgr C), revealing spatially varying magnetic fields having orientations that generally trace the total intensity morphologies of the clouds. We find evidence that compression from stellar winds and shear from tidal forces are prominent mechanisms influencing the structure of the magnetic fields.

在星体的核心坍缩过程中，释放出大量的能量，产生持续约10秒钟的各种中微子的爆发。恒星的氢包层中发生的逆贝塔衰变会产生电磁级联，最终在0.511 MeV的特征能量处引发伽马射线的闪耀，成为中微子爆发的“回音”。它的光度曲线具有快速上升、同样快速的下降，以及之间持续约一分钟或一小时的平台。对于近地球的恒星（距离D≲1 kpc），回音将可以在未来的伽马射线望远镜上观测到，只要其有效面积达到103 cm2或更大。其观测将为我们提供关于包层大小和成分的信息。与直接探测到的中微子爆发结合起来，还可以提供有关离开视线的中微子发射的信息，并进行恒星表面至地球之间中微子传播效应的检测。<br /><br />总结:本研究分析了恒星核心坍缩产生的中微子爆发引发的伽马射线闪耀现象。通过观测这一现象，可以获取有关恒星包层大小和成分的信息，并对中微子在恒星表面至地球之间的传播效应进行测试。 <div>
When a star undergoes core collapse, a vast amount of energy is released in a ∼10 s long burst of neutrinos of all species. Inverse beta decay in the star’s hydrogen envelope causes an electromagnetic cascade that ultimately results in a flare of gamma rays—an “echo” of the neutrino burst—at the characteristic energy of 0.511 MeV. We study the phenomenology and detectability of this flare. Its luminosity curve is characterized by a fast, seconds-long rise and an equally fast decline, with a minute- or hour-long plateau in between. For a near-Earth star (distance D ≲ 1 kpc) the echo will be observable at near future gamma-ray telescopes with an effective area of 103 cm2 or larger. Its observation will inform us on the envelope size and composition. In conjunction with the direct detection of the neutrino burst, it will also give information on the neutrino emission away from the line of sight and will enable tests of neutrino propagation effects between the stellar surface and Earth.

<div> ALMA Band 6 observations, Class II protoplanetary disks, external far-ultraviolet radiation, chemical composition, Orion Nebula Cluster

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了在奥利安星云星团边缘的两个受辐射的Class II原行星盘的化学成分。研究发现，受辐射的盘与孤立的盘没有显著差异，这表明它们距离大型Trapezium恒星足够远，使得其化学成分不再受到外部FUV辐射的影响。研究还指出，这些发现更可能与不同恒星质量相关，而非外部辐射场。为了进一步阐明外部辐射对不同类型盘中行星形成化学的影响，需要对质量较低的盘和靠近大型Trapezium恒星的盘进行更多观测。 <div>
Most stars are born in stellar clusters, and their protoplanetary disks, which are the birthplaces of planets, can, therefore, be affected by the radiation of nearby massive stars. However, little is known about the chemistry of externally irradiated disks, including whether or not their properties are similar to the so-far better-studied isolated disks. Motivated by this question, we present ALMA Band 6 observations of two irradiated Class II protoplanetary disks in the outskirts of the Orion Nebula Cluster to explore the chemical composition of disks exposed to (external) far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation fields: the 216-0939 disk and the binary system 253-1536A/B, which are exposed to radiation fields of 102–103 times the average interstellar radiation field. We detect lines from CO isotopologues, HCN, H2CO, and C2H toward both protoplanetary disks. Based on the observed disk-integrated line fluxes and flux ratios, we do not find significant differences between isolated and irradiated disks. The observed differences seem to be more closely related to the different stellar masses than to the external radiation field. This suggests that these disks are far enough away from the massive Trapezium stars, that their chemistry is no longer affected by external FUV radiation. Additional observations toward lower-mass disks and disks closer to the massive Trapezium stars are required to elucidate the level of external radiation required to make an impact on the chemistry of planet formation in different kinds of disks.

<div> 关键词: 太阳耀斑，日冕物质抛射，能谱形状，太阳高能电子，加速过程

总结: 本研究就太阳高能电子谱的六种类型进行了探讨，并发现它们与太阳喷发现象的关联。具体来说，单幅功率谱(SPL)类型与硬X射线耀斑和西半球冠质物质抛射(CME)的关联较强，而上升双幂律(UDPL)类型与II型射电爆发和日冕物质抛射的关联显著，且速度更快。对于DDPL和ER类型，以及LP和DDPL类型，分别与II型射电爆发和全圆日冕物质抛射的关联较弱。此外，DDPL类型谱指数与关联CME速度呈正相关，而与耀斑强度呈负相关，而DDPL类型则相反。这些结果表明SPL类型可能是高处太阳日冕内的初始加速过程的结果，并为后续加速过程提供种子群体，形成了其他五种类型的高能电子谱。 <br /><br />

The energy spectral shape of solar energetic electron events carries important information on the energetic electron source/acceleration at the Sun. We investigate the association of six newly identified solar energetic electron spectral types with solar eruptive phenomena, including the downward double-power-law (DDPL) spectrum with break energy EB above 20 keV (DDPL ), DDPL with EB below 20 keV (DDPL ), upward double-power law (UDPL), single-power-law (SPL), Ellision–Ramaty–like (ER), and logarithmic-parabola (LP). We find that the SPL type shows (the other five types show) an association with hard X-ray flares of ∼38% (∼55%–82%) and an association with west-limb coronal mass ejections (CMEs) of ∼76% (∼85%–93%). Among the other five types, the DDPL and ER (LP and DDPL ) types only have an association with type II radio bursts of ∼7%–8% (∼16%–20%) and an association with halo CMEs of ∼5%–9% (∼11%–21%); however, the UDPL type exhibits a significant (∼47% and ∼50%) association with type II bursts and halo CMEs, with a significantly faster median CME speed of km s−1. For DDPL (DDPL ) with a positive (no) correlation between spectral indexes and no (a positive) correlation between the spectral index and break energy, the spectrum appears to be flatter as the associated CME (flare) becomes faster (stronger). These results suggest that the SPL type can result from the initial acceleration process that likely occurs high in the corona, and then provide seed populations for further acceleration processes to form the other five types: the DDPL and ER types via flare-related processes, the LP and DDPL types via CME-related processes, and the UDPL type via CME-driven shocks.

在这项研究中，通过使用JWST/NIRCam成像技术，我们对星系在“再电离纪”之前和之后的性质进行了调查，我们发现了(Hβ + [O iii])强发射体的一些重要性质，它们显示出在红移z = 5.5–7时的显著特征。在星系比星的质量和年龄之间存在着一定的关联性，并且与特定的星形成率(sSFR)呈正相关。在星形成率-星系质量平面上，这些发射体分布在主序列和星暴区，这在低星系质量时变得模糊。此外我们还发现星系的Hβ + [O iii]发射等当于具有高的特定的星形成率。因此，在研究星系的宇宙星系形成活动时，考虑到发射体和非发射体的星系是非常重要的。 <br /><br />总结: 星系的性质在再电离纪前后有显著变化，这与星系质量和特定的星形成率相关，Hβ + [O iii]和特定的星形成率相关，发射体和非发射体的星系性质相似，需要整体考虑星系形成活动。 <div>
We investigate the properties of strong (Hβ + [O iii]) emitters before and after the end of the “Epoch of Reionization” from z = 8 to z = 5.5. We make use of ultradeep JWST/NIRCam imaging in the parallel field (P2) of the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) in the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (H-XDF), in order to select prominent (Hβ + [O iii]) emitters (with rest-frame equivalent width (EW0) ≳ 100 Å) at z = 5.5–7, based on their flux density enhancement in the F356W band with respect to the spectral energy distribution continuum. We complement our selection with other (Hβ + [O iii]) emitters from the literature at similar and higher (z = 7−8) redshifts. We find (nonindependent) anticorrelations between EW0(Hβ + [O iii]) and both galaxy stellar mass and age, in agreement with previous studies, and a positive correlation with specific star formation rate (sSFR). On the SFR–M⋆ plane, the (Hβ + [O iii]) emitters populate both the star formation main sequence and the starburst region, which become indistinguishable at low stellar masses ( ). We find tentative evidence for a nonmonotonic relation between EW0(Hβ + [O iii]) and SFR, such that both parameters correlate with each other at SFR ≳ 1 M⊙ yr−1, while the correlation flattens out at lower SFRs. This suggests that low metallicities producing high EW0(Hβ + [O iii]) could be important at low SFR values. Interestingly, the properties of the strong emitters and other galaxies (33% and 67% of our z = 5.5–7 sample, respectively) are similar, including, in many cases, high sSFR. Therefore, it is crucial to consider both emitters and nonemitters to obtain a complete picture of the cosmic star formation activity around the Epoch of Reionization.

<div> 分布、挥发物质、火星、形成、地幔

火星的形成过程中，挥发性物质如水、氢和碳在大气层、地幔和地核中的分布情况进行了分析。这种挥发性物质的分配对于影响内在磁场的产生、地幔对流和岩浆活动至关重要。研究表明，形成过程导致了火星地幔和地核中存在水和轻元素。研究采用了一种混合型原大气模型，考虑了上层由星云成分构成，下层由简化构建模块的撞击脱气成分构成。数值分析暗示，在火星大约达到现在一半大小后，形成这种高温高压的岩浆海会引发水蒸气、碳和氢从原始大气层迁移到行星内部。最终，大约数百亿吨的水可能已经分布到地幔中，并且如果再次通过撞击脱气形成塔尔西斯高原的洪水玄武岩，可能已经补给了火星古代的海洋。与此同时，数百亿吨的碳和数百亿吨的氢（相当于数百亿吨的H2O）发现分布在地核中。尽管硫的分布被简化为所有的硫都在地核中，但硫占地核质量的14%到19%的结果与“洞察”号所建议的地核密度一致。 <br /><br />总结: 火星形成过程中，水、碳和氢等挥发性物质从原始大气层迁移到内部，供给了火星古代海洋的水，分布在地幔和地核中。同时，硫主要分布在地核中。 <div>
We analyze the distribution of volatiles such as water, hydrogen, and carbon within the atmosphere, mantle, and core of Mars during its accretion stages. The partitioning of these volatiles is crucial as it influences the generation of intrinsic magnetic fields, mantle convection, and magmatic activity. The study suggests that the accretion process is responsible for the presence of water and light elements within the Martian mantle and core. We employ a hybrid-type proto-atmosphere model, which considers an upper layer composed of nebula components and a lower layer made up of degassed components from the impact degassing of the simplified building blocks based on the two-component model. Our numerical analysis implies that the formation of a magma ocean at this high temperature and pressure after around the half-size of the present Mars triggers the migration of water vapor, carbon, and hydrogen from the primordial atmosphere into the planetary interior. Ultimately, several 1021 kg of water could have been distributed to the mantle and, if degassed again by the formation of flood basalts on the Tharsis Plateau, could have supplied Mars’ ancient oceans. Meanwhile, several 1020 kg of carbon and 1019 kg of hydrogen (equivalent to 1020 kg H2O) were found to be distributed in the core. Although the distribution of sulfur was simplified so that all of the sulfur is in the core, a result of sulfur accounting for 14 wt% to 19 wt.% of the core mass would be consistent with the core density suggested by InSight.

We report the discovery of an S-shaped morphology of the radio galaxy J0644+1043 imaged with a 30 μJy beam−1 sensitive 525 MHz broadband (bands 3 + 4) uGMRT map. Dedicated spectroscopic observations of the host galaxy carried out with the 2 m Rozhen telescope yielded a redshift of 0.0488, giving a projected linear size of the peculiar radio structure of over 0.7 Mpc. This giant radio galaxy is powered by a black hole of mass M⊙, from the vicinity of which emanate well-collimated and knotty jets, each ∼100 kpc long. The entire radio structure, presumably due to the effective jet precession, is less than 50 Myr old, has a power of ∼6 × 1024 W Hz−1 at 1.4 GHz, and has observed morphological characteristics that do not strictly conform to the traditional Fanaroff–Riley (FR) FR I or FR II categories.

<div> 关键词: Chandra X-ray Observatory, 反冲冲击, 超新星遗迹, 辐射谱学, 速度测量<br />
总结: 通过查看超新星遗迹Cassiopeia A的数据，利用Chandra X射线天文台的数据，研究了其中的反冲冲击现象。从S/Si Kα线流量比和Fe Kα线重心能量的径向分布图中可以看出，它们都呈单调增加的趋势，确认了Si和Fe丰富的喷射物质被反冲冲击加热。在Cassiopeia A中，S和Si线流量比的突然变化明显可见，从而确定了反冲冲击的位置，在观测者框架内，北西方向约为3950±210 km/s，南东方向约为2900±260 km/s。同时，喷射物质的框架内速度为北西方约为1150 km/s，南东方约为1300 km/s。通过测量得到的反冲冲击速度与X射线和/或光学图像获得的速度非常一致。这表明爆发星的非对称爆炸对反冲冲击和喷射物质的相互作用起着关键作用，最终塑造了超新星遗迹中观察到的复杂特征。 <br /><br /> <div>
Using data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we revisit the reverse shock in the supernova remnant (SNR) Cassiopeia A. Based on spectroscopy of a series of annuli in the northwest (NW) and southeast (SE), we get the radial profiles of the S/Si Kα line flux ratio and Fe Kα line centroid energy. They both show monotonic increase, confirming that the Si- and Fe-rich ejecta are heated by the reverse shock. The abrupt change of the S and Si line flux ratio is clearly observed in Cassiopeia A, leading to the determination of the reverse-shock location (∼1.′71 0.′16 and ∼1.′35 0.′18 in the NW and SE, with respect to the central source). By comparing the radial profiles of the S and Si line flux, we find that the reverse shock is moving outward in the frame of the observer, and the velocities are ∼3950 ± 210 km s−1 and ∼2900 ± 260 km s−1 in the NW and SE, respectively. In contrast, the velocities become ∼1150 km s−1 (NW) and ∼1300 km s−1 (SE) in the ejecta frame. Our measured reverse-shock velocities are quite consistent with those obtained from the X-ray and/or optical images. They therefore supply a cross-check of the accuracy for the two available methods for measuring the reverse-shock velocity in SNRs. Both the location and the velocity of the reverse shock show apparent asymmetry, suggesting that the asymmetric explosion of the progenitor plays a key role in the interaction between the reverse shock and the ejecta, ultimately shaping the complex features observed in SNRs.

总结:
本研究利用磁层多尺度探测器的高频数据首次证实了在电子尺度上存在周期调制的重连现象。这种周期调制被认为是由X线施加的有限磁场阱所导致的，这产生了离散的、色散的电子条纹。这些色散的条纹很好地由一个磁场阱损失转换模型所重现，它们周期性地打破了冻结条件并驱动能量耗散。这种电子转换效应消除了自由电子，增强了电子混合，并产生了高度结构化的三维分布，这产生了强烈的无线电辐射。这些启示性的结果表明，重连过程具有固有的由三维电子物理学确定的周期性，为理解空间和天体等离子体中重连驱动的能量传输提供了关键的见解。 <div>
We present the first evidence for periodically modulated reconnection at the electron scale in space, using unparalleled, high-cadence data from Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft. The periodic modulation is attributed to finite magnetic trapping imposed by the X-line, which generates discrete, dispersive electron stripes. The dispersive stripes, well reproduced by a trapping-loss transition model, periodically break the frozen-in condition and drive energy dissipation. Such an electron transition effect eliminates free electrons, enhances electron mixing, and causes highly structured, three-dimensional distributions that generate intense radio emissions. These illuminating results, suggesting that reconnection hosts inherent periodicity determined by three-dimensional electron physics, provide crucial insights into understanding reconnection-driven energy transport in space and astrophysical plasmas.

Its broadband afterglow was well monitored by Swift/XRT and ground-based optical telescopes. The optical light curve of GRB 180418A can be modeled by forward shock (FS) plus reverse shock (RS). We fit the light curves with standard external shock models and derive the physical properties of the outflow. It is found that the ratio RB ≡ εB,r/εB,f is 11.22, indicating a moderate degree of magnetization in the RS region. The reported duration of GRB 180418A, T90, lies in the intermediate region between short and long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We further discuss the classification of GRB 180418A, and calculate ε = Eγ,iso,52/Ep,z,2 values of 0.026 and 0.018 (assuming the redshift z is 1.0 and 1.5, respectively), which is closer to short GRBs (SGRBs) in the ε-T90,z plane. If GRB 180418A is an SGRB, it is the only reported SGRB thus far with RS emission in optical light curves. In order to compare the properties of GRB 180418A, we collected three SGRBs that may have RS emission (GRBs 060313, 090426, and 210207B) and also 22 long GRBs (LGRBs) with RS emission. We find that the parameters of LGRBs are in a wider range than those of SGRBs. Also, SGRBs appear to have very small RB values, but the results are generally similar to those of LGRBs. The fitting parameters of GRB 180418A are generally consistent with those of the other three SGRBs, implying that GRB 180418A may belong to the category of SGRBs.

<div> 关键词: Grid Agnostic Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD), Jupiter's magnetosphere, reconnection, solar wind, simulations

总结:<br />
本研究使用了Grid Agnostic Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) for Extended Research Applications (GAMERA)模型对木星磁尾重新连接进行了模拟。研究结果表明，木星磁尾重新连接主要发生在午夜和午夜后区域，并受太阳风影响。太阳风增压会压缩木星磁层，减少重新连接的发生。研究验证了GAMERA模型在模拟木星磁层中的适用性，为我们提供了对木星磁层动态结构和太阳风响应的新见解。 <div>
In this study, we employ the Grid Agnostic Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) for Extended Research Applications (GAMERA), a high-resolving-power, three-dimensional global MHD model, to simulate magnetotail reconnection in Jupiter's magnetosphere. While previous satellite observations have provided initial statistics on magnetotail reconnection properties at Jupiter, they have been limited in spacetime coverage, leaving the dynamic process of Jovian magnetotail reconnection and its response to the solar wind (SW) poorly understood. Using MHD simulations, we quantitatively analyze the temporal evolution and spatial dependence of nightside reconnection in Jupiter's magnetotail under ideal quiet and enhanced SW conditions. Our results demonstrate that magnetotail reconnection tends to occur in the midnight and postmidnight sectors, with a low occurrence in the premidnight sector, consistent with both Galileo and Juno observations and predictions by Delamere & Bagenal. The magnetic local time (MLT)–radial distribution of magnetotail reconnection is broad, indicating that Jovian magnetotail reconnection is always dynamic rather than steady state. Enhanced SW ram pressure can decrease the MLT coverage of magnetotail reconnection by compressing Jupiter's magnetosphere. However, the occurrence of magnetotail reconnection near the midnight and postmidnight sectors is enhanced by SW compression beyond 60 RJ, but is not significantly impacted by SW compression within 60 RJ. Conversely, SW compression suppresses reconnection in the premidnight sector, leading to a stronger dawn–dusk asymmetry in the occurrence and location of magnetotail reconnection. This study validates the applicability of the GAMERA code for simulating Jupiter’s magnetosphere and provides complementary insights into the dynamic structure and the SW response of Jupiter’s magnetosphere.

<div> 关键词: 宇宙学，径向加速度关系，星系，暗物质，加速度

在最近的研究中，发现了显示星系动力学特性的普遍关系。其中，径向加速度关系（RAR）是最受欢迎的关系之一，可以视为连接星系中的动力学径向加速度和重子加速度的普遍法则。这揭示了暗物质与星系中的重子物质之间意想不到的密切联系。本文通过对最近强大的银河旋转曲线分析，导出了银河RAR（GRAR），首次表明所谓的最佳拟合通用RAR与GRAR数据偏离超过5σ。这为以往研究所声称的星系中RAR的普遍性提供了强有力的证据。 <br /><br />总结: 宇宙学研究发现了一种普遍关系，即径向加速度关系（RAR），它连接了星系中的动力学径向加速度和重子加速度。然而，最新研究表明，这种普遍性可能不存在，并且在银河RAR数据方面存在显著偏差。这一发现为以往研究的观点提供了强有力的反驳。 <div>
In the past few decades, many studies revealed that there exist some apparent universal relations that can describe the dynamical properties in galaxies. In particular, the radial acceleration relation (RAR) is one of the most popular relations discovered recently that can be regarded as a universal law to connect the dynamical radial acceleration with the baryonic acceleration in galaxies. This has revealed an unexpected close connection between dark matter and baryonic matter in galaxies. In this article, by following the recent robust Galactic rotation curve analyzes, we derive the Galactic RAR (GRAR) and show for the first time that the alleged best-fit universal RAR deviates from the GRAR data at more than 5σ. This provides a strong evidence to falsify the universal nature of RAR in galaxies claimed in past studies.

<title>A Comprehensive Metallicity Analysis of J0332−3557: Establishing a z ∼ 4 Anchor for Direct Gas Metallicity and C/O Abundance Investigations</title>

<div> Hubble Space Telescope, VLT/FORS2, metallicity, C/O ratio, star formation<br /><br />总结: 本研究通过分析J0332-3557的光谱和光度数据，得出了其在红移z ∼ 4时的气体金属丰度和C/O比值。结果表明，J0332-3557的气体金属丰度与红移为z ∼ 0时相比有所增加，而其C/O比值较低，表明其处于星际介质碳元素富集的早期阶段。此外，J0332-3557的碳发射主要来源于其紧凑区域。这项研究为探究金属丰度和C/O比值在不同红移下的演化提供了重要的参考。 <div>
We provide one of the most comprehensive metallicity studies at z ∼ 4 by analyzing the UV/optical Hubble Space Telescope photometry and rest-frame Very Large Telescope (VLT)/FORS2 UV and VLT/XSHOOTER optical spectra of J0332−3557, a gravitationally lensed galaxy magnified by a factor of 20. With a 5σ detection of the auroral O iii] λ1666 line, we are able to derive a direct gas metallicity estimate for our target. We find Zgas , which is compatible with an increase of both the gas fraction and the outflow metal loading factor from z ∼ 0 to z ∼ 4. J0332−3557 is the most metal-rich individual galaxy at z ∼ 4 for which the C/O ratio has been measured. We derive a low log(C/O) = −1.02 ± 0.2, which suggests that J0332−3557 is in the early stages of interstellar medium carbon enrichment driven mostly by massive stars. The low C/O abundance also indicates that J0332−3557 is characterized by a low star formation efficiency, higher yields of oxygen, and longer burst duration. We find that EWC III]1906,9 is as low as ∼3 Å, and the main drivers of the low EWC III]1906,9 are the higher gas metallicity and the low C/O abundance. J0332−3557 is characterized by one diffuse and two more compact regions ∼1 kpc in size. We find that the carbon emission mostly originates in the compact knots. Our study on J0332−3557 serves as an anchor for studies investigating the evolution of metallicity and C/O abundance across different redshifts.

<div> 星球、恒星、磁场、可居住区、外星生命
总结:
本研究考察了围绕恒星的类地行星在潜在的适居区的可居住性。磁场的存在和强度以及与恒星磁场的相互作用是影响外行星可能适居性的关键因素之一。同时，行星需有足够强大的磁场来抵御恒星活动的影响，并且需远离恒星以避免直接的磁场连接。研究发现，84颗外行星满足这些条件，并且被认为是未来寻找外星生命迹象的最佳目标。 <div>
Considerable interest has centered on Earth-like planets orbiting in the circumstellar habitable zone (CHZ) of its star. However, the potential habitability of an exoplanet depends upon a number of additional factors, including the presence and strength of any planetary magnetic field and the interaction of this field with that of the host star. Not only must the exoplanet have a strong enough magnetic field to shield against stellar activity, but it must also orbit far enough from the star to avoid direct magnetic connectivity. We characterize stellar activity by the star’s Rossby number, Ro, the ratio of stellar rotation rate to convective turnover time. We employ a scaled model of the solar magnetic field to determine the star’s Alfvén radius, the distance at which the stellar wind becomes super-Alfvénic. Planets residing within the Alfvén surface may have a direct magnetic connection to the star and therefore not be the most viable candidates for habitability. Here, we determine the Rossby number of a sample of 1053 exoplanet-hosting stars for which the rotation rates have been observed and for which a convective turnover time can be calculated. We find that 84 exoplanets in our sample have orbits which lie inside the CHZ and that also lie outside the star’s Alfvén surface: 34 of these have been classified as terran (11) or superterran (23) planets. Applying the Alfvén surface habitability criterion yields a subset of the confirmed exoplanets that may be optimal targets for future observations in the search for signatures of life.

总结: 本文介绍了Galaxy Assembly and Interaction Neural Networks (Gainn)，这是一系列用于基于James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)光度测量预测模拟星系红移、恒星质量、暗物质和质量加权年龄的人工神经网络。文章旨在确定在11 < z < 15时预测这些变量的最佳神经网络。神经网络的输入是JWST的一个子集五个宽波段滤光片（F150W、F200W、F277W、F356W和F444W）和两个中波段滤光片（F162M和F182M）的滤光片差值。我们比较了使用不同组合的滤光片以及不同的激活函数和层数的神经网络的性能。最佳神经网络的预测红移的标准化均方根误差为，预测恒星质量的均方根误差为，预测暗物质的均方误差为，预测质量加权年龄的均方根误差为。我们还测试了Gainn对JWST观测到的MACS0647JD的实际数据的性能。Gainn对对象的第一投影（JD1）的预测呈现出标准化偏差 〈Δz〉 < 0.00228，这显著小于模板拟合方法得到的结果。我们发现，在考虑JWST的理论精度和观测资源时，最佳的滤光片组合是F277W、F356W、F162M和F200W。 <div>
We present the Galaxy Assembly and Interaction Neural Networks (Gainn), a series of artificial neural networks for predicting the redshift, stellar mass, halo mass, and mass-weighted age of simulated galaxies based on James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) photometry. Our goal is to determine the best neural network for predicting these variables at 11 < z < 15. The parameters of the optimal neural network can then be used to estimate these variables for real, observed galaxies. The inputs of the neural networks are JWST filter magnitudes of a subset of five broadband filters (F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, and F444W) and two medium-band filters (F162M and F182M). We compare the performance of the neural networks using different combinations of these filters, as well as different activation functions and numbers of layers. The best neural network predicted redshift with a normalized rms error of , stellar mass with rms = , halo mass with a mean-squared error of , and mass-weighted age with rms = . We also test the performance of Gainn on real data from MACS0647JD, an object observed by JWST. Predictions from Gainn for the first projection of the object (JD1) have normalized bias 〈Δz〉 < 0.00228, which is significantly smaller than found with template-fitting methods. We find that the optimal filter combination is F277W, F356W, F162M, and F200W when considering both theoretical accuracy and observational resources from JWST.

该研究通过对30 Doradus地区H2CO的观测，揭示了R136恒星团对周围气体的影响。研究发现，随着距离R136的距离增加，气体动力学温度呈下降趋势，暗示了恒星的加热作用。另外，研究结果表明机械加热对H2CO测量温度的影响不明显。此外，在ALMA的CO观测中并未观察到R136附近的机械反馈增强的迹象。该地区的宇宙射线通量估计不确定，但可能解释了观测到的温度情况。研究还表明，H2CO发射气体受R136直接辐射和光解区光电加热的影响。总结: 该研究通过H2CO的观测揭示了R136恒星团对周围气体的影响，并探讨了加热机制和宇宙射线通量的可能性。 <div>
Feedback from star formation is a critical component of the evolution of galaxies and their interstellar medium. At parsec scales internal to molecular clouds, however, the observed signatures of that feedback on the physical properties of CO-emitting gas have often been weak or inconclusive. We present subparsec observations of H2CO in the 30 Doradus region, which contains the massive star cluster R136 that is clearly exerting feedback on its neighboring gas. H2CO provides a direct measure of gas kinetic temperature, and we find a trend of decreasing temperature with projected distance from R136 that may be indicative of gas heating by the stars. While it has been suggested that mechanical heating affects H2CO-measured temperature, we do not observe any correlation between TK and line width. The lack of an enhancement in mechanical feedback close to R136 is consistent with the absence of a radial trend in gravitational boundedness seen the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array CO observations. Estimates of cosmic-ray flux in the region are quite uncertain, but can plausibly explain the observed temperatures if R136 itself is the dominant local source of energetic protons. The observations presented here are also consistent with the H2CO-emitting gas near R136 being dominated by direct radiation from R136 and photoelectric heating in the photodissociation regions.

<div> 宇宙尘埃（diffuse lights）, N体模拟（N-body simulations）, 星系（galaxies）, 组和团（groups and clusters）, 红移（redshift）
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章探讨了宇宙尘埃在红移为1.5时的形成情况和主要形成机制。研究发现，无论宿主暗物质晕的质量或动力状态如何，贡献宇宙尘埃的Typical progenitors都以含有大量星系的巨型星系的形式进入暗物质晕。此外，在未动态稳定或更庞大的宿主暗物质晕中，来自含有大质量的Typical progenitors的宇宙尘埃更加显著，且其中一半以上已经在进入宿主暗物质晕之前经历了预处理过程。宇宙尘埃的主要形成机制是卫星星系的剥离过程，而40%-45%的宇宙尘埃星系与最明亮星系的合并树相关。此外，宇宙尘埃在具有相似质量的宿主暗物质晕中所占的比例随着红移的增加而减少，但在z=1.5时已经相当可观（约为10%）。然而，值得注意的是，与可观测半径和微弱表面亮度相关的探测限制可能会掩盖大量宇宙尘埃星系，甚至改变宇宙尘埃的主要形成渠道。 <div>
We explore the formation of the intragroup light and intracluster light, representing diffuse lights within groups and clusters, from the point that z = 1.5. For this, we perform multiresolution cosmological N-body simulations using the “galaxy replacement technique” and identify the progenitors in which the diffuse light stars existed when they fell into the groups or clusters. Our findings reveal that typical progenitors contributing to diffuse lights enter the host halo with massive galaxies containing a stellar mass of , regardless of the mass or dynamical state of the host halos at z = 0. In cases where the host halos are dynamically unrelaxed or more massive, diffuse lights from massive progenitors with are more prominent, with over half of them already preprocessed before entering the host halo. Additionally, we find that the main formation mechanism of diffuse lights is the stripping process of satellites, and a substantial fraction (40%–45%) of diffuse light stars are linked to the merger tree of the brightest cluster galaxy. Remarkably, all trends persist for groups and clusters at higher redshifts. The fraction of diffuse lights in the host halos with a similar mass decreases as the redshift increases, but they are already substantial at z = 1.5 (∼10%). However, it is crucial to acknowledge that detection limits related to the observable radius and faint-end surface brightness may obscure numerous diffuse light stars and even alter the main formation channel of diffuse lights.

总结:
研究人员使用CoCoNuT-FMT代码模拟了3D磁转变超新星模型的内部喷射产生的核合成产物。结果显示，强磁场可以提取原中子星的转动能量，导致爆炸比 typcial 的中微子驱动超新星早且更有能量（约3×1051 erg）。与无磁参考模型相比，磁转变模型的喷射物具有更多的中子丰富成分，Ye值降至约0.25。后处理计算表明，磁转变模型能够产生重元素，直到质量数约130。分析显示，两个磁转变模型（初始磁场强度分别为1010 G和1012 G）在重元素合成方面几乎没有差异，这与它们类似的爆炸动力学一致。此外，磁转变模型产生的放射性的56Ni质量约为0.19和0.14 M☉，接近超新星核合成的镍质量。研究结果已在Zenodo上公开发布，可供与恒星丰度图案比较，并用于建模银河化学演化，并与其他产物计算进行比较。这些结果丰富了三维磁转变超新星模拟的核合成产物研究，有助于量化产物的不确定性。 <div>
Core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosions powered by rotation and magnetic fields present an interesting astrophysical site for nucleosynthesis that potentially contributes to the production of r-process elements. Here we present yields of the innermost ejecta in 3D magnetorotational CCSN models simulated using the CoCoNuT-FMT code. Strong magnetic fields tap the rotational energy of the proto−neutron star and lead to earlier and more energetic (∼3 × 1051 erg) explosions than typical neutrino-driven CCSNe. Compared to a reference nonmagnetic model, the ejecta in the magnetorotational models have much more neutron-rich components with Ye down to ∼0.25. Our post-processing calculations with the reaction network SkyNet show significant production of weak r-process elements up to mass number ∼130. We find negligible differences in the synthesis of heavy elements between two magnetorotational models with different initial field strengths of 1010 and 1012 G, in accord with their similar explosion dynamics. The magnetorotational models produce about ∼0.19 and 0.14 M☉ of radioactive 56Ni, on the low end of inferred hypernova nickel masses. The yields are publicly available at Zenodo (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.10578981) for comparison with stellar abundance patterns, inclusion in modeling galactic chemical evolution, and comparison with other yield calculations. Our results add to the yet-restricted corpus of nucleosynthesis yields from 3D magnetorotational supernova simulations and will help quantify yield uncertainties.

本文报告了一个包含碳丰富的Wolf–Rayet星和一个OB星的长周期双星系统WR 125的最新观测结果。该系统出现了自1991年以来首次被NEOWISE-R探测到的红外暴发。研究者利用新的近红外和中红外光度测量数据验证了这两次暴发的一致性，并推导出了该系统的轨道周期。另外，通过光谱测量和分析，他们还确定了该系统的轨道偏心率，并对尘埃的性质和温度进行了研究。这些观测结果为未来的观测规划和尘埃形成的Wolf–Rayet双星系统研究提供了重要参考。<br /><br /> <div>
Several long-period binaries with a carbon-rich Wolf–Rayet star and an OB star produce dust in their wind collisions. In eccentric binaries, this is seen most strongly near periastron passage. The exact conditions leading to dust creation require the orbital properties to be determined, which is difficult owing to their long periods. Recently, the binary system WR 125 (WC7 + O9III) began a dust-creation episode seen through an infrared outburst first detected by NEOWISE-R, which was the first outburst detected since 1991. We present new near- and mid-infrared photometry, which we use to show consistency between the two outbursts and derive an orbital period of yr. We use a long time series of optical spectra to place the first constraints on its orbital elements, on the assumption that this system will produce dust near periastron. The orbit has a mild eccentricity of 0.29 ± 0.12 and is only derived for the Wolf–Rayet component, as the O star’s radial velocities have noise that is likely larger than the expected semiamplitude of the orbit. We also present SOFIA/FORCAST grism spectroscopy to examine the infrared spectral energy distribution of the dust during this outburst, comparing its properties to other WCd binaries, and deriving a dust temperature of 580 K in 2021. This collection of observations will allow us to plan future observations of this system and place the system in the context of dust-creating Wolf–Rayet binaries.

We report the results of an extensive set of simulations exploring the sensitivity of the BlackCAT CubeSat to long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). BlackCAT is a NASA APRA-funded CubeSat mission for the detection and real-time subarcminute localization of high-redshift (z ≳ 3.5) GRBs. Thanks to their luminous and long-lived afterglow emissions, GRBs are uniquely valuable probes of high-redshift star-forming galaxies and the intergalactic medium. In addition, each detected GRB with a known redshift serves to localize a region of high-redshift star formation in three dimensions, enabling deep follow-on searches for host galaxies and associated local and large-scale structures. We explore two distinct models for the GRB redshift distribution and luminosity function, both consistent with Swift observations. We find that, for either model, BlackCAT is expected to detect a mean of 42 bursts per year on orbit, with 6.7% to 10% of these at z > 3.5. BlackCAT bursts will be localized to an r90 ≲ 55″ precision and reported to the community within seconds. Due to the mission orbit and pointing scheme, bursts will be located in the night sky and well placed for deep multiwavelength follow-up observations.

<div> IC220405B, AT2021lwx, Tidal Disruption Event, Neutrino, Isotropic Emission Model

这篇文章讨论了天体物理中微中微子IC220405B和最近报道的极端高能潮汐撕裂事件(TDE)候选对象AT2021lwx (ZTF20abrbeie, 别名“Scary Barbie”)之间可能的关联。尽管TDE与重建的中微子事件方向相差2°6'（超出90%置信水平定位区域之外），但TDE候选对象与迄今为止报道的中微子-TDE关联具有一些重要特征：强红外灰尘回波、高玻色度光度、相对于峰值质量吸积率存在约百天的中微子时间延迟和高观测到的X射线光度。我们使用各向同性辐射模型来解释这种新的关联，其中中微子是由加速质子与红外光子碰撞产生的。在考虑AT2021lwx的高红移之后（通过在超大质量黑洞(SMBH)框架中解释数据），我们发现预期的中微子通量和中微子时间延迟在 qualitatively 上与其他TDEs是可比较的。由于数据仅在SMBH框架内的峰值后300天可用，灰尘回波解释存在显著的不确定性，因此在预测检测到的中微子数量方面也存在不确定性。我们建议对这个物体进行进一步的延长期跟踪，并建议在这种特殊情况下修改中微子到达方向的重建。 <br /><br />总结: 中微子IC220405B与高能潮汐撕裂事件AT2021lwx可能存在关联，尽管它们的方向有所偏差，但它们共享了一些重要的特征，如红外灰尘回波、高玻色度光度、中微子时间延迟和高观测X射线光度。使用各向同性辐射模型解释这种新的关联后，发现预期的中微子通量和中微子时间延迟与其他潮汐撕裂事件是可比较的，并建议对该物体进行进一步跟踪。 <div>
We discuss the possible association of an astrophysical neutrino (IC220405B) with the recently reported, extremely energetic tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate AT2021lwx (ZTF20abrbeie, aka “Scary Barbie”) at redshift z = 0.995. Although the TDE is about 2.°6 off the direction of the reconstructed neutrino event (outside the 90% confidence level localization region), the TDE candidate shares some important characteristics with so-far-reported neutrino–TDE associations: a strong infrared dust echo, high bolometric luminosity, a neutrino time delay with respect to the peak mass accretion rate of the order of a hundred days, and a high observed X-ray luminosity. We interpret this new association using an isotropic emission model, where neutrinos are produced by the collision of accelerated protons with infrared photons. After accounting for the high redshift of AT2021lwx (by interpreting the data in the supermassive black hole (SMBH) frame), we find that the expected neutrino fluences and neutrino time delays are qualitatively comparable to the other TDEs. Since data are only available up to 300 days postpeak in the SMBH frame, significant uncertainties exist in the dust echo interpretation, and therefore in the predicted number of neutrinos detected, . We recommend further follow-up of this object for an extended period and suggest refining the reconstruction of the neutrino arrival direction in this particular case.

<title>Infrared Band Strengths of Dangling OH Features in Amorphous Water at 20 K</title>

Infrared (IR) spectra of vapor-deposited amorphous water at low temperatures show two weak peaks at around 3720 and 3696 cm−1 assigned to free-OH stretching modes of two- and three-coordinated water molecules (so-called “dangling” OH bonds), respectively, on the ice surface. A recent JWST observation first succeeded in detection of a potential dangling OH feature at 3664 cm−1 for ices in molecular clouds, highlighting the importance of dangling OH bonds in interstellar ice chemistry. A lack of band strengths of these features at low temperatures restricts the quantification of dangling OH bonds from IR spectra, hindering development of a molecular-level understanding of the surface structure and chemistry of ice. Using IR multiple-angle incidence resolution spectrometry, we quantified the band strengths of two- and three-coordinated dangling OH features in amorphous water at 20 K as being 4.6 ± 1.6 × 10−18 and 9.1 ± 1.0 × 10−18 cm molecule−1, respectively. These values are more than an order of magnitude lower than band strengths of bulk-water molecules in ice and liquid water and are similar to those of H2O monomers confined in solid matrices. Adsorption of carbon monoxide with dangling OH bonds results in the appearance of a new broad dangling OH feature at 3680–3620 cm−1, with a band strength of 1.8 ± 0.1 × 10−17 cm molecule−1. The band strengths of dangling OH features determined in this study advance our understanding of the surface structure of interstellar ice analogs and recent IR observations of the JWST.

<title>Numerical Simulation of Equal Ratio Relations for the Peak Intensities of >10 MeV Energetic Protons</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Previous studies have highlighted the significance of perpendicular diffusion in the decay phase of particle intensities for >10 MeV energetic protons. Recently, an observational study has indicated that the peak intensity ratios across different energy channels (13−64 MeV protons) remain almost constant as the spacecraft location varies in many solar proton events. This interesting phenomenon is referred to as equal ratio relations. These findings suggest that perpendicular diffusion not only affects particle intensity during the decay phase but also throughout the rising phase. In this study, we perform numerical simulations of >10 MeV energetic proton events observed by STEREO A, STEREO B, and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. Our findings demonstrate that perpendicular diffusion strongly affects the entire time profile of particle intensity for spacecraft not magnetically connected to the source region. The numerical simulation results indicate that in order to reproduce observations, we need to include perpendicular diffusion near the source region and in interplanetary space. Perpendicular diffusion leads to nearly uniform peak ratios at different locations and contributes to the formation of the reservoir phenomenon during the decay phase. Consequently, these numerical results support the significant role of perpendicular diffusion in the formation of the longitudinal distribution of >10 MeV proton events.

The stellar spectra from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) medium-resolution survey can be used to search for compact objects in binaries. The LAMOST Data Release 10 catalog includes >980,000 targets with multiple medium-resolution spectra. We select the targets with large or rapid radial-velocity variation, and obtained an input sample of 1822 sources. We use light curves and spectra to identify and exclude eclipsing binaries and double-lined spectroscopic binaries in the input sample. We finally derive a catalog of 89 candidates with well-folded radial velocity, which are all single-lined spectroscopic binaries, indicating an unseen companion residing in each system. The mass function of each system can be well constrained based on the radial-velocity curve. In our sample, 26 sources have mass function higher than 0.1 M⊙, among which 18 sources have ellipsoidal-type light curves. In our opinion, compact objects are likely existent in all these 26 binaries, which are worth follow-up identification.

总结:<br /><br />本研究使用N-体模拟模拟了巨行星系统的不稳定演化过程，从共振的初始条件开始，经过盘的消散和其他阶段。通过比较合成系统的周期比和标准化角动量分布与长周期木星型行星的观测统计，得出了关于轨道迁移速率、气体驱动偏心率阻尼效率和典型初始多重性的约束条件。研究发现，倾向于初始条件密集、阻尼效果较弱和巨行星数目较高。此外，模型表明，共振链的起源并不能以足够高的速率通过共面高偏心率路径形成热木星，以解释它们的观测普遍性。 <div>
Orbital evolution is a critical process that sculpts planetary systems, particularly during their early stages where planet–disk interactions are expected to lead to the formation of resonant chains. Despite the theoretically expected prominence of such configurations, they are scarcely observed among long-period giant exoplanets. This disparity suggests an evolutionary sequence wherein giant planet systems originate in compact multiresonant configurations, but subsequently become unstable, eventually relaxing to wider orbits—a phenomenon mirrored in our own solar system’s early history. In this work, we present a suite of N-body simulations that model the instability-driven evolution of giant planet systems, originating from resonant initial conditions, through phases of disk dispersal and beyond. By comparing the period ratio and normalized angular momentum distributions of our synthetic aggregate of systems with the observational census of long-period Jovian planets, we derive constraints on the expected rate of orbital migration, the efficiency of gas-driven eccentricity damping, and typical initial multiplicity. Our findings reveal a distinct inclination toward densely packed initial conditions, weak damping, and high giant planet multiplicities. Furthermore, our models indicate that resonant chain origins do not facilitate the formation of Hot Jupiters via the coplanar high-eccentricity pathway at rates high enough to explain their observed prevalence.

<title>ALMA Reveals Spatially Resolved Properties of Molecular Gas in the Host Galaxy of FRB 20191001A at z = 0.2340</title>

<br /><br />
这篇文章报告了使用Atacama大型毫米/亚毫米阵列从快速无线电暴(FRB) 20191001A的宿主星系中检测到CO(2-1)发射线，其空间分辨率达到0.9″(相当于3.5千秒差距) ，红移z = 0.2340。这是以宇宙距离探测到的第一个FRB宿主星系的空间分辨CO发射。推断出宿主星系的分子气体质量为(2.3 ± 0.4) × 1010M⊙，表明其富含气体，所得的分子气体比例μgas = 0.50 ± 0.22。这种分子气体质量和宿主星系的恒星形成率SFR = (8.06 ± 2.42) M⊙ yr−1，与其他FRB宿主星系观察到的分子气体质量Mgas = 9.6 × 108M⊙和SFR = 0.90M⊙ yr−1有所不同。这进一步证实了FRB可能起源于多样化星系环境中的单个或多个祖先的假设。基于观察到的速度场建模，分子气体盘主要由有序的循环旋转主导，尽管宿主星系有一个富含气体的伴星系，投影距离约为25 kpc。FRB祖先的形成可能并不是由这种相互作用触发的。我们推导了FRB检测点的分子气体柱密度的3σ上限为<2.1 × 1021 cm−2。

<br /><br />总结: 
- 通过ALMA探测到FRB宿主星系的CO(2-1)发射线，第一次在宇宙距离实现了这一成就。
- 推测宿主星系的分子气体质量和星形成率与其他FRB宿主星系有所不同，支持FRB可能起源于不同星系环境的假设。
- 分子气体盘显示出有序循环旋转，伴星系的影响可能并不是FRB祖先形成的触发因素。 <div>
We report the detection of the CO(2–1) emission line with a spatial resolution of 0.″9 (3.5 kpc) from the host galaxy of the fast radio burst (FRB), FRB 20191001A at z = 0.2340, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. This is the first detection of spatially resolved CO emission from the host galaxy of an FRB at a cosmological distance. The inferred molecular gas mass of the host galaxy is (2.3 ± 0.4) × 1010M⊙, indicating that it is gas-rich, as evidenced by the measured molecular gas fraction μgas = 0.50 ± 0.22. This molecular gas mass and the star formation rate of the host, SFR = (8.06 ± 2.42) M⊙ yr−1, differ from those observed in the other FRB host galaxies with the average Mgas = 9.6 × 108M⊙ and SFR = 0.90M⊙ yr−1. This lends further credibility to the hypothesis that FRBs may originate from single or multiple progenitors across a diverse range of galaxy environments. Based on the observed velocity field modeling, we find that the molecular gas disk is dominated by an ordered circular rotation, despite the fact that the host galaxy has a gas-rich companion galaxy with a projected separation of ∼25 kpc. The formation of the FRB’s progenitor might not have been triggered by this interaction. We derive the 3σ upper limit of the molecular gas column density at the FRB detection site to be <2.1 × 1021 cm−2 with a 3σ upper limit.

There are two classes of gamma-ray transients with a duration shorter than 2 s. One consists of cosmic short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) taking place in the deep Universe via the neutron star mergers, and the other is the magnetar giant flares (GFs) with energies of ∼1044 − 1046 erg from “nearby” galaxies. Though the magnetar GFs and the short GRBs have rather similar temporal and spectral properties, their energies (Eγ,iso) are different by quite a few orders of magnitude and hence can be distinguished supposing the host galaxies have been robustly identified. The newly observed GRB 231115A has been widely discussed as a new GF event for its high probability of being associated with M82. Here we conduct a detailed analysis of its prompt emission observed by Fermi-GBM and compare the parameters with existing observations. The prompt gamma-ray emission properties of GRB 231115A, if associated with M82, nicely follow the Ep,z–Eγ,iso relation of the GFs, where Ep,z is the peak energy of the gamma-ray spectrum after the redshift (z) correction. To be a short GRB, the redshift needs to be ∼1. Though such a chance is low, the available X-ray/GeV observation upper limits are not stringent enough to further rule out this possibility. We have also discussed the prospect of convincingly establishing the magnetar origin of GRB 231115A-like events in the future.

Detecting imprints of orbital eccentricity in gravitational-wave (GW) signals promises to shed light on the formation mechanisms of binary black holes. To constrain the formation mechanisms, distributions of eccentricity derived from numerical simulations of astrophysical formation channels are compared to the estimates of eccentricity inferred from GW signals. We report that the definition of eccentricity typically used in astrophysical simulations is inconsistent with the one used while modeling GW signals, with the differences mainly arising due to the choice of reference frequency used in both cases. We also posit a prescription for calculating eccentricity from astrophysical simulations, by evolving ordinary differential equations obtained from post-Newtonian theory and using the dominant (ℓ = m = 2) mode’s frequency as the reference frequency; this ensures consistency in the definitions. On comparing the existing eccentricities of the binaries present in the Cluster Monte Carlo catalog of globular cluster simulations with the eccentricities calculated using the prescription presented here, we find a significant discrepancy at e ≳ 0.2; this discrepancy becomes worse with increasing eccentricity. We note the implications this discrepancy has for existing studies and recommend that care be taken when comparing data-driven constraints on eccentricity to expectations from astrophysical formation channels.

总结:
这项研究对近9600个宽线选择的活动星系核（AGN）进行了研究，它们的宿主星系由Sloan Digital Sky Survey（SDSS）数据发布17号检测到。研究通过对比原始SDSS光度数据和在接下来几天到几十年内在Sloan g、r和i波段测得的光谱光度测量来计算整体变异性统计。通过对SDSS光谱拟合星系和AGN模板，研究分离出了AGN组分和宿主星系。研究对象的绝对星等在-24 < Mi < -18之间，且处于红移小于z ∼ 0.9范围内。变异性分析显示，亮度和变化幅度之间的反相关关系延伸至log(Lbol [erg s−1]) = 43.5，证明了这种关系在AGN光度上延伸了4个数量级。为了进一步探索AGN光度和变异性之间的关系，研究测定了Hβ线宽和静止5100 Å波长处的单色光度来确定黑洞质量和吸积率。研究结果表明，吸积率是影响变异幅度的主要参数，并且吸积率与振幅之间的反相关关系延伸至低至1% Eddington的吸积率。此外，研究还发现了变异幅度与黑洞质量之间的反相关关系，其中与低吸积率的AGN间的相关性最强。 <div>
We present the results from a study of ∼9600 broadline-selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with host galaxies detected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 17. We compute ensemble variability statistics based on a comparison of the original SDSS photometric data with spectrophotometric measurements obtained days to decades later in the Sloan g, r, and i bands. Galaxy and AGN templates have been fitted to the SDSS spectra to isolate the AGN component from the host galaxy. The sources have absolute magnitudes in the range −24 < Mi < −18 and lie at redshifts less than z ∼ 0.9. A variability analysis reveals that the anticorrelation between luminosity and variability amplitude continues down to log(Lbol [erg s−1]) = 43.5, demonstrating that the relationship extends by 4 orders of magnitude in AGN luminosity. To further explore the connection between AGN luminosity and variability, we determine the black hole mass and the accretion rate through measurement of the Hβ line width and the monochromatic luminosity at rest frame 5100 Å. Our results suggest that the accretion rate is the dominant parameter impacting the amplitude of variability and that the anticorrelation between the accretion rate and amplitude extends to rates as low as 1% Eddington. Moreover, we also identify an anticorrelation between the variability amplitude and black hole mass, with the correlation appearing strongest among the AGNs with low accretion rates.

总结：<br /><br />本文研究了通过气体的两向空气动力学相互作用来实现固体浓缩，以及最终形成类地行星的流动不稳定性。作者进行了3D层流剪切盒模拟，并发现强制湍流可以显著增加所需的浓度阈值，作者还提供了临界Z的单一拟合值，并估计了考虑了粒子反馈和外部湍流的粒子尺度高度。最终实验表明，形成类地行星需要超过单位的粒子与气体的密度比值。 <div>
The streaming instability (SI) is a leading candidate for planetesimal formation, which can concentrate solids through two-way aerodynamic interactions with the gas. The resulting concentrations can become sufficiently dense to collapse under particle self-gravity, forming planetesimals. Previous studies have carried out large parameter surveys to establish the critical particle to gas surface density ratio (Z), above which SI-induced concentration triggers planetesimal formation. The threshold Z depends on the dimensionless stopping time (τs, a proxy for dust size). However, these studies neglected both particle self-gravity and external turbulence. Here, we perform 3D stratified shearing box simulations with both particle self-gravity and turbulent forcing, which we characterize via a turbulent diffusion parameter, αD. We find that forced turbulence, at amplitudes plausibly present in some protoplanetary disks, can increase the threshold Z by up to an order of magnitude. For example, for τs = 0.01, planetesimal formation occurs when Z ≳ 0.06, ≳0.1, and ≳0.2 at αD = 10−4, 10−3.5, and 10−3, respectively. We provide a single fit to the critical Z required for the SI to work as a function of αD and τs (although limited to the range τs = 0.01–0.1). Our simulations also show that planetesimal formation requires a mid-plane particle-to-gas density ratio that exceeds unity, with the critical value being largely insensitive to αD. Finally, we provide an estimation of particle scale height that accounts for both particle feedback and external turbulence.

The roles that mass and environment play in galaxy quenching are still under debate. Leveraging the Photometric objects Around Cosmic webs method, we analyze the excess surface distribution of photometric galaxies in different colors (rest-frame u − r) within the stellar mass range of 109.0 ∼ 1011.0M⊙ around spectroscopic massive central galaxies (1010.9 ∼ 1011.7M⊙) at the redshift interval of 0 < zs < 0.7, utilizing data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program and the spectroscopic samples of Slogan Digital Sky Survey (i.e., Main, LOWZ, and CMASS samples). We find that both mass and environmental quenching contribute to the evolution of companion galaxies. To isolate the environmental effect, we quantify the quenched fraction excess (QFE) of companion galaxies encircling massive central galaxies within 0.01h−1 Mpc < rp < 20h−1 Mpc, representing the surplus quenched fraction relative to the average. We find that the high-density halo environment affects star formation quenching up to about three times the virial radius, and this effect becomes stronger at lower redshift. We also find that even after being scaled by the virial radius, the environmental quenching efficiency is higher for more massive halos or for companion galaxies of higher stellar mass, though the trends are quite weak. We present a fitting formula that comprehensively captures the QFE across central and companion stellar mass bins, halo-centric distance bins, and redshift bins, offering a valuable tool for constraining galaxy formation models. Furthermore, we have made a quantitative comparison with IllustrisTNG that underscores some important differences, particularly in the excessive quenching of low-mass companion galaxies (<109.5M⊙) in the simulation.

<div> M87, radio galaxy, jet, X-ray image, flux variability
总结:
M87是一个著名的射电星系，其射流中的HST-1节点在X射线波段具有明亮的光结，我们分析了这个节点的X射线图像和通量变化。我们使用了2000年至2021年间112次Chandra ACIS-S观测数据进行了分析，总曝光时间为884千秒。通过解卷积图像研究了X射线射流的亮度分布，并测量了核心和HST-1的相对距离。从2003年到2005年（与HST-1的明亮闪耀同时），我们发现HST-1的通量与其与核心的偏移之间存在相关性。在随后的数据中，我们发现这种偏移稳定增加，这意味着HST-1的速度为6.6 ± 0.9c（2.0 ± 0.3 pc yr−1），与先前的结果一致。我们讨论了通量-偏移相关性的模型，这些模型包括了两个或四个相距数十秒差距的发射区域。我们将这些结果归因于射流中的移动激波，这使我们能够测量射流的内部结构。 <div>
The radio galaxy M87 is well known for its jet, which features a series of bright knots observable from radio to X-ray wavelengths. We analyze the X-ray image and flux variability of the knot HST-1 in the jet. Our analysis includes all 112 available Chandra ACIS-S observations from 2000 to 2021, with a total exposure time of ∼884 ks. We use deconvolved images to study the brightness profile of the X-ray jet and measure the relative separation between the core and HST-1. From 2003 to 2005 (which coincides with a bright flare from HST-1), we find a correlation between the flux of HST-1 and its offset from the core. In subsequent data, we find a steady increase in this offset, which implies a bulk superluminal motion for HST-1 of 6.6 ± 0.9 c (2.0 ± 0.3 pc yr−1), in keeping with prior results. We discuss models for the flux–offset correlation that feature either two or four emission regions separated by tens of parsecs. We attribute these results to moving shocks in the jet, which allow us to measure the internal structure of the jet.

<div> 光度观测，多波段，超新星，核心坍塌，尘埃
总结:
本文报告了对M101星系中SN 2023ixf的多波段光度观测结果。超新星的绝对光度在爆发后3.9天达到最大值，之后逐渐稳定至约90天。有效温度在最初的观测后逐渐下降，并在两个月后稳定在约(3000-4000)K。光球半径的演化与速度呈现出类似于全同展开的趋势，并在之后缩小。根据放射性尾迹，初始镍质量约为0.098太阳质量。爆炸能量和喷射物质量分别估计为E ≃(1.0-5.7) × 10^51 erg和Mej ≃(3.8-16)太阳质量。峰值绝对光度被认为是喷射物与周围介质（CSM）相互作用的结果。我们发现一个冲击形成的CSM质量为MCSM ≃0.013太阳质量，CSM密度为ρCSM ≃2.5 × 10^-13克/厘米^3，以及一个前体恒星的质量损失率。 <div>
SN 2023ixf, recently reported in the nearby galaxy M101 at a distance of 6.85 Mpc, was one of the closest and brightest core-collapse supernovae in the last decade. In this work, we present multiwavelength photometric observation of SN 2023ixf with the Multi-channel Photometric Survey Telescope (Mephisto) in the uvgr bands and with the twin 50 cm telescopes in the griz bands. We find that the bolometric luminosity reached the maximum value of 3 × 1043 erg s−1 at 3.9 days after the explosion and fully settled onto the radioactive tail at ∼90 days. The effective temperature decreased from 3.2 × 104 K at the first observation and approached a constant of ∼(3000–4000) K after the first 2 months. The evolution of the photospheric radius is consistent with a homologous expansion with a velocity of 8700 km s−1 in the first 2 months, and it shrunk subsequently. Based on the radioactive tail, the initial nickel mass is about MNi ∼ 0.098 M⊙. The explosion energy and the ejecta mass are estimated to be E ≃ (1.0–5.7) × 1051 erg and Mej ≃ (3.8–16) M⊙, respectively. The peak bolometric luminosity is proposed to be contributed by the interaction between the ejecta and the circumstellar medium (CSM). We find a shocked CSM mass of MCSM ∼ 0.013 M⊙, a CSM density of ρCSM ∼ 2.5 × 10−13 g cm−3, and a mass-loss rate of the progenitor of .

<div> 磁场、分子云核、星盘、磁场形态、盘半径

磁场在分子云核中可能在星盘形成过程中发挥作用。通过ALMA大型项目“嵌入盘早期行星形成（eDisk）”对16个原恒星核进行了研究，解析了它们的盘，并使用JCMT POL-2观测推导了0.1 pc尺度的磁场形态。从密核中测量了磁场的平均取向和角度离散度，并与eDisk项目中动力学测定的原恒星质量的尺度和1.3毫米连续盘的半径进行了比较。我们观察到盘的半径与恒星质量之间存在显著的相关性，但没有发现盘半径与磁场取向角或磁场角度离散度之间的统计显著依赖性。然而，在考虑投影效应时，我们不能排除盘半径与三维空间中的偏离角之间存在正相关性的可能性。我们的结果表明，密核中磁场的形态可能在盘形成过程中并不起主导作用。相反，原恒星盘的尺寸可能更受到已被吸积到星+盘系统中的质量以及可能的其他参数（例如磁场强度、核自转和磁扩散性）的影响。 <br /><br />总结: 研究发现密核中的磁场形态对星盘形成过程不起主导作用，星盘的尺寸更可能受到被吸积到星+盘系统中的质量以及其他参数的影响。 <div>
The magnetic field of a molecular cloud core may play a role in the formation of circumstellar disks in the core. We present magnetic field morphologies in protostellar cores of 16 targets in the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array large program “Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk),” which resolved their disks with 7 au resolutions. The 0.1 pc scale magnetic field morphologies were inferred from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope POL-2 observations. The mean orientations and angular dispersions of the magnetic fields in the dense cores are measured and compared with the radii of the 1.3 mm continuum disks and the dynamically determined protostellar masses from the eDisk program. We observe a significant correlation between the disk radii and the stellar masses. We do not find any statistically significant dependence of the disk radii on the projected misalignment angles between the rotational axes of the disks and the magnetic fields in the dense cores, nor on the angular dispersions of the magnetic fields within these cores. However, when considering the projection effect, we cannot rule out a positive correlation between disk radii and misalignment angles in three-dimensional space. Our results suggest that the morphologies of magnetic fields in dense cores do not play a dominant role in the disk formation process. Instead, the sizes of protostellar disks may be more strongly affected by the amount of mass that has been accreted onto star+disk systems, and possibly other parameters, for example, magnetic field strength, core rotation, and magnetic diffusivity.

总结: 
本文报告了在加州大学洛杉矶分校的大型等离子体装置上进行的激光驱动的月球类离子尺度磁层中磁重联的实验研究。实验使用高重复频率（1赫兹）、纳秒激光驱动快速移动的无碰撞等离子体，该等离子体扩展到嵌入在背景等离子体和磁场中的脉冲磁偶极产生的场中。高重复频率使得可以获取磁场和电场的时间分辨率三维数据，以表征磁重联并计算重联速率。研究人员显著观察到与重联相关的霍尔场的形成。还进行了粒子在格模拟，以研究相互作用的微观物理特性。通过分析广义欧姆定律项，研究人员发现仅由电子驱动的重联通过电子压力各向异性的动力学效应。这些结果与最近的卫星测量结果进行了比较，该测量结果发现月球表面附近存在磁重联的证据。 <br /><br /> <div>
Mini-magnetospheres are small ion-scale structures that are well suited to studying kinetic-scale physics of collisionless space plasmas. Such ion-scale magnetospheres can be found on local regions of the Moon, associated with the lunar crustal magnetic field. In this paper, we report on the laboratory experimental study of magnetic reconnection in laser-driven, lunar-like ion-scale magnetospheres on the Large Plasma Device at the University of California, Los Angeles. In the experiment, a high-repetition rate (1 Hz), nanosecond laser is used to drive a fast-moving, collisionless plasma that expands into the field generated by a pulsed magnetic dipole embedded into a background plasma and magnetic field. The high-repetition rate enables the acquisition of time-resolved volumetric data of the magnetic and electric fields to characterize magnetic reconnection and calculate the reconnection rate. We notably observe the formation of Hall fields associated with reconnection. Particle-in-cell simulations reproducing the experimental results were performed to study the microphysics of the interaction. By analyzing the generalized Ohm’s law terms, we find that the electron-only reconnection is driven by kinetic effects through the electron pressure anisotropy. These results are compared to recent satellite measurements that found evidence of magnetic reconnection near the lunar surface.

<br />总结:<br />本文基于CHIME/FRB目录，构建了一个贝叶斯框架，分析了FRB的种群，并考虑了CHIME望远镜的选择效应。能量函数被建模为带有指数截断的幂律。文章考虑了四种红移分布模型，分别是星体形成历史模型和三个时滞模型（高斯时滞、对数正态时滞和幂律时滞）。利用贝叶斯推理方法同时约束了自由参数，并使用贝叶斯信息准则（BIC）进行模型比较。根据BIC，对数正态时滞模型最符合数据。幂律时滞模型和高斯时滞模型也能给出合理的拟合，尽管它们不及对数正态时滞模型好。然而，与三种时滞模型相比，星体形成历史模型被强烈排斥。能量函数被紧密约束，几乎不受红移模型的影响，最佳拟合的幂律指数α约为1.8，截止能量为。FRB种群平均显示与星体形成历史相比3∼5十亿年的时间延迟。因此，FRB种群追踪星体形成历史的假设被最终排除。 <div>
In spite of significant progress in the research of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in recent decades, their origin is still under extensive debate. Investigation of the population of FRBs can provide new insight into this interesting problem. In this paper, based on the first Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME)/FRB catalog, we construct a Bayesian framework to analyze the FRB population, with the selection effect of the CHIME telescope being properly taken into account. The energy function is modeled as the power law with an exponential cutoff. Four redshift distribution models are considered, i.e., the star formation history (SFH) model, and three time-delayed models (Gaussian delay, log-normal delay, and power-law delay). The free parameters are simultaneously constrained using the Bayesian inference method, and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is used in model comparison. According to the BIC, the log-normal delay model fits the data best. The power-law delay model and Gaussian delay model can also give reasonable fits, although they are not as good as the log-normal delay model. However, the SFH model is strongly disfavored compared with the three time-delayed models. The energy function is tightly constrained and is almost independent of the redshift models, with the best-fitting power-law index α ≈ 1.8 and cut-off energy . The FRB population shows on average a 3 ∼ 5 billion yr time delay with respect to the SFH. Therefore, the hypothesis that the FRB population traces the SFH is conclusively ruled out.

总结:<br /><br />这项研究利用星系-星系透镜数据在星系尺度上测试了广义相对论和f(T)引力理论。通过使用精确的球对称f(T)理论解和Navarro-Frenk-White模型对过剩表面密度进行建模，研究了引力势能、剪切分量和有效过剩表面密度在f(T)引力理论下与广义相对论的偏离。研究还对星系按颜色分为蓝色和红色，并利用信息准则对f(T)引力理论在偏离中心效应下的效率进行了分析。结果表明f(T)引力理论在拟合数据时比广义相对论和ΛCDM范例更具优势，对后者构成了挑战。 <div>
We use galaxy–galaxy lensing data to test general relativity and f(T) gravity at galaxy scales. We consider an exact spherically symmetric solution of f(T) theory, which is obtained from an approximate quadratic correction, and thus it is expected to hold for every realistic deviation from general relativity. Quantifying the deviation by a single parameter Q, and following the post-Newtonian approximation, we obtain the corresponding deviation in the gravitational potential, shear component, and effective excess surface density profile. We used five stellar mass samples and divided them into blue and red galaxies to test the model dependence on galaxy color, and we modeled the excess surface density profiles using the Navarro–Frenk–White profiles. Based on the group catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7) we finally extract Mpc−2 at 1σ confidence. This result indicates that f(T) corrections on top of general relativity are favored. Finally, we apply information criteria, such as the Akaike and Bayesian ones, and although the dependence of f(T) gravity on the off-center effect implies that its optimality needs to be carefully studied, our analysis shows that f(T) gravity is more efficient in fitting the data compared to general relativity and the ΛCDM paradigm, and thus it offers a challenge to the latter.

总结:<br />
年轻的恒星在联合中形成，提供了一个理想的环境来测量一个同龄人口的年龄。通过等时线拟合来测量同龄人口的年龄，这是一种典型的方法，但观测偏差可能会影响到对人口的物理特性的理解。研究发现，在星形成区域的等时线拟合中存在着表面上的质量依赖的年龄梯度，较低质量的恒星看起来比较高质量的恒星要年轻。星斑和星体多重性被认为是产生质量依赖的年龄梯度的机制，但星斑和多重性之间的相对重要性尚不清楚。研究采用模拟10兆年星际联合的类比进行了合成红光低分辨率光谱调查，包括质量依赖的多重性统计和年龄依赖的星斑覆盖分数。研究发现，仅仅未被发现的星斑并不会产生质量依赖的年龄梯度，而是均匀降低了人口的平均测量年龄。另外，二元星系统会产生质量依赖的年龄梯度，并且引入比星斑更多的年龄测量的离散度，但只要每个目标的距离测量准确，就可以很容易地从人口中剔除。研究得出结论，必须将星斑和未被发现的恒星多重性的特征纳入到对年轻星际联合的等时线拟合中，才能获得可靠的年龄。 <div>
Young stars form in associations, meaning that young stellar associations provide an ideal environment to measure the age of a nominally coeval population. Isochrone fitting, which is the typical method for measuring the age of a coeval population, can be impacted by observational biases that obscure the physical properties of a population. One feature in isochrone fits of star-forming regions is an apparent mass-dependent age gradient, where lower-mass stars appear systematically younger than higher-mass stars. Starspots and stellar multiplicity are proposed mechanisms for producing the mass-dependent age gradient, but the relative importance of starspots versus multiplicity remains unclear. We performed a synthetic red optical low-resolution spectroscopic survey of a simulated analog to a 10 Myr stellar association including mass-dependent multiplicity statistics and age-dependent starspot coverage fractions. We found that undetected starspots alone do not produce an apparent mass-dependent age gradient, but instead uniformly reduce the average measured age of the population. We also found that binaries continue to produce an apparent mass-dependent age gradient and introduce more scatter in the age measurement than spots, but are easily removed from the population as long as there are good distance measurements to each target. We conclude that it is crucial to incorporate treatments of both starspots and undetected stellar multiplicity into isochrone fits of young stellar associations to attain reliable ages.

本研究关注太阳风粒子的加热和加速问题，利用机器学习中的聚类技术分离出太阳风速度分布中的主要成分，发现质子和阿尔法粒子存在温度不均和粒子束现象。研究结果表明，阿尔法粒子存在大约占其核心的50%的大规模粒子束，而质子和阿尔法粒子的温度比大于4主要是因为存在大规模的阿尔法粒子束。此外，发现阿尔法粒子束和核心对Alfvénic波动和冲浪效应敏感，而质子和阿尔法粒子束之间存在共同的加热和加速机制。 <div>
The problems of heating and acceleration of solar wind particles are of significant and enduring interest in astrophysics. The interactions between waves and particles are crucial in determining the distributions of proton and alpha particles, resulting in non-Maxwellian characteristics, including temperature anisotropies and particle beams. These processes can be better understood as long as the beam can be separated from the core for the two major components of the solar wind. We utilized an alternative numerical approach that leverages the clustering technique employed in machine learning to differentiate the primary populations within the velocity distribution rather than employing the conventional bi-Maxwellian fitting method. Separation of the core and beam revealed new features for protons and alphas. We estimated that the total temperature of the two beams was slightly higher than that of their respective cores, and the temperature anisotropy for the cores and beams was larger than 1. We concluded that the temperature ratio between alphas and protons largely over 4 is due to the presence of a massive alpha beam, which is approximately 50% of the alpha core. We provided evidence that the alpha core and beam populations are sensitive to Alfvénic fluctuations and the surfing effect found in the literature can be recovered only when considering the core and beam as a single population. Several similarities between proton and alpha beams would suggest a common and local generation mechanism not shared with the alpha core, which may not have necessarily been accelerated and heated locally.

We present Keck Cosmic Web Imager integral-field unit observations around extended Lyα halos of 27 typical star-forming galaxies with redshifts 2.0 < z < 3.2 drawn from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field survey. We examine the average Lyα surface brightness profiles in bins of star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass (M*), age, stellar continuum reddening, SFR surface density (ΣSFR), and ΣSFR normalized by stellar mass (ΣsSFR). The scale lengths of the halos correlate with stellar mass, age, and stellar continuum reddening and anticorrelate with SFR, ΣSFR, and ΣsSFR. These results are consistent with a scenario in which the down-the-barrel fraction of Lyα emission is modulated by the low-column-density channels in the interstellar medium, and in which the neutral gas covering fraction is related to the physical properties of the galaxies. Specifically, we find that this covering fraction increases with stellar mass, age, and E(B − V) and decreases with SFR, ΣSFR, and ΣsSFR. We also find that the resonantly scattered Lyα emission suffers greater attenuation than the (nonresonant) stellar continuum emission, and that the difference in attenuation increases with stellar mass, age, and stellar continuum reddening, and decreases with ΣsSFR. These results imply that more reddened galaxies have more dust in their circumgalactic medium.

<br />总结:
本文提出了一种使用特征函数方法分析恒星爆炸光学曲线的方法，该方法基于延迟引爆模型并利用 LC stretch、前体白矮星的主序质量、中心密度等三个参数。研究表明，SNe Ia具有不同的特征和宿主星系相关性，其中根据恒星进化速度可以将其分为快速和缓慢两组。同时，对于91T型的SNe Ia来说，其光学曲线非常相似，且与恒星形成区域相关，有望成为早期宇宙中至 z≈4-11 的恒星形成追踪物。对于超亮型和亚亮型的SNe Ia，有约6%的异常数据可以归因于宿主的活跃恒星形成。最后，研究表明对于SNe Ia的多次爆发场景以及未来的调查具有重要意义。 <div>
We present an eigenfunction method to analyze 161 visual light curves (LCs) of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) obtained by the Carnegie Supernova Project to characterize their diversity and host-galaxy correlations. The eigenfunctions are based on the delayed-detonation (DD) scenario using three parameters: the LC stretch s determined by the amount of deflagration burning governing the 56Ni production, the main-sequence mass MMS of the progenitor white dwarf controlling the explosion energy, and its central density ρc shifting the 56Ni distribution. Our analysis tool (Supernova Parameter Analysis Tool) extracts the parameters from observations and projects them into physical space using their allowed ranges (MMS ≤ 8 M⊙, ρc ≤ 7–8 × 109 g cm−3). The residuals between fits and individual LC points are ≈1%–3% for ≈92% of objects. We find two distinct MMS groups corresponding to a fast (≈4–65 Myr) and a slow(≈200–500 Myr) stellar evolution. Most underluminous SNe Ia have hosts with low star formation but high MMS, suggesting slow evolution times of the progenitor system. 91T-like SNe show very similar LCs and high MMS and are correlated to star formation regions, making them potentially important tracers of star formation in the early Universe out to z ≈ 4–11. Some ∼6% outliers with nonphysical parameters using DD scenarios can be attributed to superluminous SNe Ia and subluminous SNe Ia with hosts of active star formation. For deciphering the SNe Ia diversity and high-precision SNe Ia cosmology, the importance is shown for LCs covering out to ≈60 days past maximum. Finally, our method and results are discussed within the framework of multiple explosion scenarios, and in light of upcoming surveys.

总结:<br /><br />本文使用RADYN代码计算了一系列1D辐射-动力学恒星耀斑模型，这些模型受到电子束加热的短脉冲驱动。模型表明高能电子束耀斑的全球通量比趋势，光谱匹配以及氢巴尔默γ线的形成均得到了良好的解释。研究发现，压力展宽和光学深度解释了白光恒星耀斑中氢巴尔默γ线的宽组分。该研究结果还揭示了高能电子束加热如何从冲击阶段演变到逐渐衰减阶段。这一研究建立了一个公开的模型库，并探讨了可能的应用。 <div>
Optical flares have been observed from magnetically active stars for many decades; unsurprisingly, the spectra and temporal evolution are complicated. For example, the shortcomings of optically thin, static slab models have long been recognized when confronted with the observations. A less incorrect—but equally simple—phenomenological T ≈ 9000 K blackbody model has instead been widely adopted in the absence of realistic (i.e., observationally tested) time-dependent, atmospheric models that are readily available. We use the RADYN code to calculate a grid of 1D radiative-hydrodynamic stellar flare models that are driven by short pulses of electron-beam heating. The flare heating rates in the low atmosphere vary over many orders of magnitude in the grid, and we show that the models with high-energy electron beams compare well to the global trends in flux ratios from impulsive-phase stellar flare, optical spectra. The models also match detailed spectral line-shape properties. We find that the pressure broadening and optical depths account for the broad components of the hydrogen Balmer γ lines in a powerful flare with echelle spectra. The self-consistent formation of the wings and nearby continuum level provides insight into how high-energy electron-beam heating evolves from the impulsive to the gradual decay phase in white-light stellar flares. The grid is publicly available, and we discuss possible applications.

<div> Keywords: sunspot cycle, deep learning, Solar Cycle 25, Solar Cycle 26, hemispheric activity

总结: <br /><br />该研究使用Informer模型分别预测了太阳25和26周期的活动水平。结果表明，这两个周期的活动水平将继续保持较弱至中等强度，且与24周期相比更强。还观察到了Gnevyshev峰值，表明大型太阳黑子群的数量将比小型黑子群多。此外，预测表明在25周期期间，南半球的活动水平将比北半球更强，表明两个半球之间存在显著的不对称和异步性。该研究结果显示如果针对每个半球单独进行预测，太阳周期预测可以变得更加准确。此外，与基于前兆和基于模型的预测方法相一致，太阳25和26周期很可能是弱至中等强度的周期。 <div>
Forecasting the amplitude and timing of the sunspot cycle is highly important for solar physics and space weather applications, but high-precision prediction of solar magnetic activity has remained an outstanding challenge. The Informer model, as the most advanced deep learning technique, is an ideal approach for predicting solar activity cycle. Using the whole-disk sunspot numbers (SSNs) between 1749 and 2023 and the hemispheric SSNs between 1992 and 2023, the amplitudes and timings of Solar Cycles 25 and 26 are predicted by the Informer model. The main results are the following: (1) the activity levels of Solar Cycles 25 and 26 continue being weak-moderate cycles with their strengths stronger than Solar Cycle 24, implying that the long-term solar variability is significantly modulated in length and magnitude by the Gleissberg century cycle; (2) the Gnevyshev peaks of Solar Cycles 25 and 26 are clearly observed with a higher value in the second peak, suggesting that the numbers of the large sunspot groups are greater compared to the small sunspot groups in these two cycles; and (3) during Solar Cycle 25, the activity level in the southern hemisphere is predicted to be stronger than that in the northern one, revealing significant asymmetry and asynchronization between the two hemispheres. Our analysis results show that solar cycle predictions can be made more accurate if performed separately for each hemisphere. Furthermore, Solar Cycles 25 and 26 are likely to be weak-moderate cycles, in agreement with the precursor-based and model-based prediction methods.

<div> Green Bank Telescope, pulsar survey, new pulsars, binary orbit, population estimates

总结: 本文介绍了Green Bank Telescope进行的820 MHz脉冲星调查，发现了六颗新的脉冲星并发现了一颗脉冲星的共同发现。其中一颗脉冲星处于短周期（4.5小时）的双星轨道上，并对脉冲星质量进行了初步测量。调查数据还用于估计调查的灵敏度，并测量了20个检测到的源的脉冲宽度和流量。对于在350 MHz的Green Bank北天幕调查中也被探测到的源，测量了散射参数并与该地区的预期进行了比较。最后，文章指出了Typical Galactic electron density模型在调查区域中电离度测量的显然低估，并讨论了未来的观测策略。 <div>
The Green Bank 820 MHz pulsar survey covers ≃173 deg2 in the Cygnus X region of the Galaxy, centered on l = 84.°5 and b = 1.°5. Significant star formation is present in this region, and lines of sight pass through three arms of the Galaxy (Orion–Cygnus, Perseus, and an outer arm). Using the Green Bank Telescope, we recorded 200 MHz of bandwidth for 4.5 minutes at 81.92 μs resolution for each of 3457 observed survey pointings during 2016 and 2017, covering about two-thirds of the total area. We searched these data for pulsars and report the discovery of six new pulsars—PSRs J2016+3820, J2016+4231, J2019+3810, J2035+3538, J2035+3655, and J2041+4551—and the codiscovery of PSR J2057+4701. PSR J2035+3655 is in a short (4.5 hr) binary orbit; we report the full binary solution and weakly constrain the mass of the pulsar via a marginal (2σ) detection of the Shapiro delay. We also searched the survey data for known pulsars to estimate the survey’s sensitivity and measured 820 MHz pulse widths and flux density for 20 detected sources. For sources that were also detected in the Green Bank North Celestial Cap survey at 350 MHz, we measure scattering parameters and compare to expectations for the region. With these results, we revisit the population estimates that motivated this survey and consider the impact of the survey’s yield on their underlying models. We note an apparent underestimate in dispersion measure predictions from typical Galactic electron density models in the survey region, and discuss future observation strategies.

<br />
通过对IRAS 00500+6713的多波段观测研究，发现了复杂的形态，其中包括内外X射线星云夹杂的尘埃红外环。研究使用XMM-Newton和Chandra X射线天文台的存档X射线数据，以限制X射线星云的角半径、质量和金属丰度，并构建了一个描述IRAS 00500+6713动力学演化的理论模型，包括超新星喷流与中心白矮星J005311富含碳燃烧灰的强风之间相互作用的影响。研究表明，内部X射线星云对应于风终止激波，而外部X射线星云对应于SN喷射物和星际物质之间的冲击界面。我们的模型显示，如果目前观测到的来自白矮星J005311的风在爆炸后大约810年后开始吹起，即约在公元1990年后，那么观测到的X射线特性可以通过我们的模型来解释，且产生超新星的能量和质量与Type Iax SNe的特性相符。喷射物为氧-氖和碳-氧白矮星的双重退化融合产生的超新星残骸，并且白矮星J005311是幸存的融合产物。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究通过对IRAS 00500+6713的多波段观测和X射线数据的分析，揭示了其复杂的形态，并提出了一个描述其动力学演化的理论模型。研究结果表明，IRAS 00500+6713可能是Type Iax supernova SN 1181的残余物，并且白矮星J005311可能是双重退化融合的幸存产物。 <div>
IRAS 00500+6713 is a hypothesized remnant of a Type Iax supernova SN 1181. Multiwavelength observations have revealed its complicated morphology; a dusty infrared ring is sandwiched by the inner and outer X-ray nebulae. We analyze the archival X-ray data taken by XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray Observatory to constrain the angular radius, mass, and metal abundance of the X-ray nebulae, and construct a theoretical model describing the dynamical evolution of IRAS 00500+6713, including the effects of the interaction between the SN ejecta and the intense wind enriched with carbon-burning ashes from the central white dwarf (WD) J005311. We show that the inner X-ray nebula corresponds to the wind termination shock while the outer X-ray nebula to the shocked interface between the SN ejecta and the interstellar matter. The observed X-ray properties can be explained by our model with an ejecta kinetic energy of Eej = (0.77–1.1) × 1048 erg, an ejecta mass of Mej = 0.18–0.53 M⊙, if the currently observed wind from WD J005311 started to blow tw ≳ 810 yr after the explosion, i.e., approximately after 1990 CE. The inferred SN properties are compatible with those of Type Iax SNe and the timing of the wind launch may correspond to the Kelvin–Helmholtz contraction of the oxygen–neon core of WD J005311 that triggered a surface carbon burning. Our analysis supports that IRAS 00500+6713 is the remnant of SN Iax 1181 produced by a double degenerate merger of oxygen–neon and carbon–oxygen WDs, and WD J005311 is the surviving merger product.

<title>Circumnuclear Gas of a Quasar in Absorption and Emission Lines</title>

<div> quasar, absorption lines, emission lines, photoionization simulations, circumnuclear gas<br />总结:<br />这篇文章详细分析了具有异常吸收和发射线谱的类星体SDSS J074850.39+442439.0（简写为J0748+4424），其红移为z = 2.18。通过光电离模拟，发现主要是来自于单电离的铁、镍和硅离子的窄吸收线可以合理地使用具有10^21.6–10^21.9 cm^-2的中性氢柱密度和10^6.0–10^6.6 cm^-3的数密度的均匀气体板以及10^-2.8–10^-2.1的电离参数来重现。推断这些气体位于黑洞周围约30–130 pc的距离。这些中等宽度的发射线在观测到的Lyα发射线中占主导地位，同时在Hα和[O iii]发射线中也被检测到。总体而言，发射线的强度与通过吸收线导出的参数和10%的覆盖分数所预测的值大部分一致。J0748+4424中固有的DLA本身包含了大量关于周围环境的信息，同时还可以作为一种“天然日冕仪”，暴露出否则会被BELs淹没的IELs。 <div>
We present a detailed analysis of the unusual absorption- and emission-line spectrum of the quasar SDSS J074850.39+442439.0 (hereafter J0748+4424) at a redshift of z = 2.18. The archival SDSS optical spectrum is abundant in narrow absorption lines (NALs) originating from mostly singly ionized iron, nickel, and silicon ions at both ground and excited levels. With the aid of the photoionization simulations, we find that these NALs can be reasonably well reproduced by a homogeneous gas slab with a neutral hydrogen column density of 1021.6–1021.9 cm−2 and a number density of 106.0–106.6 cm−3 illuminated by the quasar central engine with an ionization parameter of 10−2.8–10−2.1. We infer the gas is located at a distance of ∼30–130 pc from the black hole. This circumnuclear gas can reveal itself in emission lines of a width of ∼1000 km s−1. Such intermediate-width emission lines (IELs) are indeed dominant in the observed Lyα emission, as the Lyα broad emission line (BEL) is mostly eaten up by the expected damped Lyα absorption (DLA). The IELs, though rather weak, are also detected in Hα and [O iii] emission lines. The IEL intensities largely agree with the predicted values by the simplified photoionization models using the parameters derived from the absorption lines and a covering fraction of 10%. The intrinsic DLA in J0748+4424, while itself contains abundant information on the circumnuclear environment, may serve as a “natural coronagraph” at the line of sight, exposing the IELs that are otherwise overwhelmed by the BELs.

总结: 
G287.76-0.87是被Trumpler 16星团辐射的柱状结构，研究发现柱体相对于这一电离源的相对速度较小，气体运动在尾部比在头部更为湍流。通过LTE条件和非LTE条件的估算，确定了柱体内部的气体柱密度。发现柱体内部的热压力足够高，使其对周围热气体和辐射反馈保持稳定，但若有活跃的恒星风，则会对周围分子云进行雕刻，形成柱状结构。 <div>
We study the kinematics of a pillar, namely G287.76-0.87, using three rotational lines of 12CO(5-4), 12CO(8-7), 12CO(11-10), and a fine structure line of [O i] 63 μm in southern Carina observed by SOFIA/GREAT. This pillar is irradiated by the associated massive star cluster Trumpler 16, which includes η Carina. Our analysis shows that the relative velocity of the pillar with respect to this ionization source is small, ∼1 km s−1, and the gas motion in the tail is more turbulent than in the head. We also performed analytical calculations to estimate the gas column density in local thermal equilibrium (LTE) conditions, which yields NCO as (∼0.2–5) × 1017 cm−2. We further constrain the gas’s physical properties in non-LTE conditions using RADEX. The non-LTE estimations result in and NCO ≃ 1016 cm−2. We found that the thermal pressure within the G287.76-0.87 pillar is sufficiently high to make it stable for the surrounding hot gas and radiation feedback if the winds are not active. While they are active, stellar winds from the clustered stars sculpt the surrounding molecular cloud into pillars within the giant bubble around η Carina.

<div> CIB, COBE/DIRBE, Planck-HFI, Galactic dust emission, IPD emission
总结: 本研究使用更新的银河尘埃发射模型，测量了COBE Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE)和Planck High-Frequency Instrument (HFI)波段的宇宙红外背景（CIB）单极，并纠正了与此相关的各种辐射和校准增益。我们得出了CIB值，与先前直接测量的CIB值相比，结果显示了140微米以上波长的值较低。在这之下的值受到了与间行星尘埃（IPD）发射相关的大不确定性的影响，因此解释起来不够清晰。 <div>
We measured the cosmic infrared background (CIB) monopole for the COBE Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) and Planck High-Frequency Instrument (HFI) bands with an updated model for the Galactic dust emission. This model includes a dust excess recently observed in 25% of the sky mainly at high latitude compared to the prediction from NH I. We correlated observations from COBE/DIRBE and Planck-HFI with this model to extract the zero levels of the sky maps. We corrected for the isotropic interplanetary dust (IPD) emission and calibration gains and obtained CIB values of 1.4 ± 8.0, 24.5 ± 3.9, 15.4 ± 4.9, 6.8 ± 2.0, 3.2 ± 0.3, 1.5 ± 0.1, 0.40 ± 0.05, 0.11 ± 0.04, 0.014 ± 0.027, and 0.008 ± 0.012 nW m−2 sr−1 at 60, 100, 140, and 240 μm, and 857, 545, 353, 217, 143, and 100 GHz. We compared those numbers with previous direct CIB measurements and extragalactic source counts. We obtain CIB values lower than previous measurements for wavelengths above 140 μm. Below this value, the large uncertainty related to the IPD emission prevents a clear interpretation.

IRAS 15099-5856的中心紧凑源IRS1的MIR成像和光谱观测揭示了其复杂的形态和离子发射线特征，表明其源自超新星喷发物，暗示了结晶硅酸盐的可能形成。 <div>
IRAS 15099-5856 in the young supernova remnant (SNR) MSH 15−52 is the first and only SNR-associated object with crystalline silicate dust detected so far, although its nature and the origin of the crystalline silicate are still unclear. In this paper, we present high-resolution mid-infrared (MIR) imaging observations of the bright central compact source IRS1 of IRAS 15099-5856 to study the spatial distributions of gas and dust and the analysis of its Spitzer MIR spectrum to explore the origin of IRS1. The MIR images obtained with the T-ReCS attached on the Gemini South telescope show a complicated, inhomogeneous morphology of IRS1 with bright clumps and diffuse emission in [Ne ii] 12.81 μm and Qa 18.30 μm, which confirms that IRS1 is an extended source externally heated by the nearby O star Muzzio 10, a candidate for the binary companion of the progenitor star. The Spitzer MIR spectrum reveals several ionic emission lines including a strong [Ne ii] 12.81 μm line, but no hydrogen line is detected. We model the spectrum using the photoionization code Cloudy with varying elemental composition. The elemental abundance of IRS1 derived from the model is close to that of supernova (SN) ejecta with depleted hydrogen and enhanced metals, particularly neon, argon, and iron. Our results imply that IRS1 originates from the SN ejecta and suggest the possibility of the formation of crystalline silicate in newly formed SN dust.

总结:
Cygnus X-3是一个高质量X射线双星系统，通过Chandra高能透射光栅分光仪获得了铁K谱线。铁K谱线显示了光电离平衡及星风中的内层壳层跃迁离散发射。观测到的禁闭线和相互作用线的发射线强度比表明，有来自镍和铍样离子态的谐振散射的显著贡献。此外，由于镍样离子的共振散射辐射的存在，可能会使铁K谱线的径向速度曲线的解释复杂化。推断结果显示，这些特征暗示着一个质量与Wolf–Rayet伴星相当的致密天体存在。 <div>
We analyze features of the Fe K spectrum of the high-mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-3. The spectrum was obtained with the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer in the third diffraction order. The increased energy resolution of the third order enables us to fully resolve the Fe xxv Heα complex and the Fe xxvi Lyα lines. The emission-line spectrum shows the expected features of photoionization equilibrium, excited in the dense stellar wind of the companion star. We detect discrete emission from inner-shell transitions, in addition to absorption likely due to multiple unresolved transitions in lower ionization states. The emission-line intensity ratios observed in the range of the spectrum occupied by the Fe xxvn = 1–2 forbidden and intercombination lines suggest that there is a substantial contribution from resonantly scattered inner-shell emission from the Li- and Be-like ionization states. The Fe xxv forbidden and intercombination lines arise in the ionization zone closest to the compact object, and since they are not subject to radiative-transfer effects, we can use them in principle to constrain the radial velocity amplitude of the compact object. We infer that the results indicate a compact object mass of the order of the mass of the Wolf–Rayet companion star, but we note that the presence of resonantly scattered radiation from Li-like ions may complicate the interpretation of the He-like emission spectrum, and specifically of the radial velocity curve of the Fe xxv forbidden line.

We present a method to estimate distances to asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the Galaxy, using spectral energy distributions (SEDs) in the near- and mid-infrared. By assuming that a given set of source properties (initial mass, stellar temperature, composition, and evolutionary stage) will provide a typical SED shape and brightness, sources are color matched to a distance-calibrated template and thereafter scaled to extract the distance. The method is tested by comparing the distances obtained to those estimated from very long baseline interferometry or Gaia parallax measurements, yielding a strong correlation in both cases. Additional templates are formed by constructing a source sample likely to be close to the Galactic center, and thus with a common, typical distance for calibration of the templates. These first results provide statistical distance estimates to a set of almost 15,000 Milky Way AGB stars belonging to the Bulge Asymmetries and Dynamical Evolution (BAaDE) survey, with typical distance errors of ±35%. With these statistical distances, a map of the intermediate-age population of stars traced by AGBs is formed, and a clear bar structure can be discerned, consistent with the previously reported inclination angle of 30° to the GC–Sun direction vector. These results motivate deeper studies of the AGB population to tease out the intermediate-age stellar distribution throughout the Galaxy, as well as determining statistical properties of the AGB population luminosity and mass-loss-rate distributions.

How many gravitational-wave observations from double compact object mergers have we seen to date? This seemingly simple question surprisingly yields a somewhat ambiguous answer that depends on the chosen data-analysis pipeline, detection threshold, and other underlying assumptions. To illustrate this we provide visualizations of the number of existing detections from double compact object mergers by the end of the third observing run (O3) based on recent results from the literature. Additionally, we visualize the expected number of observations from future-generation detectors, highlighting the possibility of up to millions of detections per year by the time next-generation ground-based detectors like Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope come online. We present a publicly available code that highlights the exponential growth in gravitational-wave observations in the coming decades and the exciting prospects of gravitational-wave (astro)physics.

<div> 关键词: Insight-HXMT, EXO 2030+375, 巨大突发, 周期变化, X射线谱

总结: <br /><br />文章报告了2021年巨大突发期间对EXO 2030+375的Insight-HXMT观测结果，发现了可能的环形共振散射特征。在突发期间，该源的X射线亮度达到了10^38 erg s−1，X射线脉冲星的自旋周期为41.27秒，表现出复杂的时间和谱变化。脉冲轮廓的形状显示出在20keV以上出现了单个主峰，而在低能段则呈现出多峰图案，随着能量增加到10-20keV，脉冲轮廓的过渡从多峰到单峰发生在约0.8×10^38 erg s−1，这表明了从亚临界亮度到超临界亮度状态的演变。此外，在接近峰值亮度时，在EXO 2030+375的脉冲分数-能量关系中发现了CRSF能量之前的一个深谷结构。对光谱参数的详细分析显示，幂律光子指数随着亮度增加呈现出三种不同的趋势，这些谱变化也标志着从亚临界到超临界状态的光谱过渡。临界亮度推断出一个磁场约为(4.8-6.0)×10^12 G，支持了约47keV的环形线的存在。在突发期间广阔的X射线谱上应用的Compton化模型也暗示着表面磁场范围在(5−9) × 10^12 G。 <div>
Based on Insight-HXMT observations of EXO 2030+375 during its 2021 giant outburst, we report the analysis of pulse variations and the broadband X-ray spectrum, and find the presence of a potential cyclotron resonant scattering feature (CRSF) with the fundamental line at ∼47 keV from both average spectra and phase-resolved spectroscopy. During the outburst, the source reached an X-ray luminosity of ∼1038 erg s−1 from 2 to 105 keV at a distance of 7.1 kpc. The X-ray pulsar at the spin period of 41.27 ± 0.61 s exhibits complex timing and spectral variations with both energy and luminosity during the outburst. The shapes of the pulse profiles show the single main peak above ∼20 keV, while appearing to exhibit multipeak patterns in low-energy bands, and the transition of the 10–20 keV pulse profiles from multipeak to single peak is observed at ∼0.8 × 1038 erg s−1, which suggests the evolution from the subcritical luminosity (pencil-beam dominated) to the supercritical luminosity (fan-beam dominated) regime. A dip structure before the energy of the CRSFs is found in the pulse fraction–energy relation of EXO 2030+375 near the peak luminosity. A detailed analysis of spectral parameters showed that the power-law photon index exhibits three distinct trends as luminosity increases, and these spectral changes also signify a spectral transition from subcritical to supercritical regimes. The critical luminosity infers a magnetic field of ∼(4.8−6.0) × 1012 G, which supports the presence of the cyclotron line at ∼47 keV. A Comptonization model applied for the broad X-ray spectra during the outburst also suggests the surface magnetic field ranging from ∼(5−9) × 1012 G.

<div> 关键词: 深度Chandra观测、SPT-CLJ 2031-4037、碰撞星系团、X射线数据、震波前沿

总结: 
研究团队进行了新的深度Chandra观测，发现了SPT-CLJ 2031-4037星系团的复杂结构，类似于子弹星系团。使用X射线数据，确认了存在两个震波前沿，分别位于西北和东南方向，通过直接测量气体温度跃变来进行确认。西北方向的震波前沿强度更大，密度跃变为3.16 ± 0.34，并且马赫数超过2，表明该星系团是罕见的高马赫数的碰撞系统。研究团队利用西北方向的震波对比了两种震波加热模型，发现温度变化符合库仑碰撞加热模型。而对于东南区域的震波前沿，发现密度跃变为1.53 ± 0.14，马赫数为。 <div>
We present our findings from the new deep Chandra observations (256 ks) of the merging galaxy cluster SPT-CLJ 2031-4037 at z = 0.34. Our observations reveal intricate structures seen in a major merger akin to the Bullet Cluster. The X-ray data confirm the existence of two shock fronts, one to the northwest and one to the southeast, by directly measuring the temperature jump of gas across the surface brightness edges. The stronger shock front in the northwest has a density jump of 3.16 ± 0.34 across the sharp surface brightness edge and Mach number , which makes this cluster one of the rare merging systems with a Mach number M > 2. We use the northwestern shock to compare two models for shock heating—the instant heating model and the Coulomb collisional heating model—and we determine that the temperatures across the shock front agree with the Coulomb collisional model of heating. For the shock front in the southeastern region, we find a density jump of 1.53 ± 0.14 and a Mach number of .

在最近的研究中发现，Ωm与个体模拟星系的属性之间存在着相对密切的相关性。由于这一发现，人们已经证明可以利用个体星系的属性来确定Ωm，并同时考虑来自超新星和活动星系核等天体物理过程的不确定性。本研究 quantifies 了使用多个星系的属性是否能够加强这些限制。为此，我们使用神经网络对Ωm和σ8两个宇宙学参数以及四个天体物理参数进行无似然推断，使用了CAMELS项目中成千上万次的流体力学模拟的多个星系的属性。我们发现，使用多个星系的属性可以增加Ωm推断的精度。此外，使用多个星系还可以推断出以前仅用单个星系难以约束的其他参数。我们展示了同一组星系属性是如何影响从一个或多个星系中获得Ωm的约束。最后，我们 quantified 了模型的鲁棒性，并发现在没有确定模型的有效范围的情况下，该模型在测试其他星系形成模型的星系时表现不佳。

<br /><br />总结: 
1. Ωm与个体模拟星系的属性存在紧密相关性
2. 使用多个星系的属性可以增加Ωm推断的精度
3. 使用多个星系还能推断出以前难以约束的其他参数
4. 显示了同一组星系属性是如何影响从一个或多个星系中获得Ωm的约束
5. 在没有确定模型的有效范围的情况下，该模型在测试其他星系形成模型的星系时表现不佳 <div>
Recent works have discovered a relatively tight correlation between Ωm and the properties of individual simulated galaxies. Because of this, it has been shown that constraints on Ωm can be placed using the properties of individual galaxies while accounting for uncertainties in astrophysical processes such as feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei. In this work, we quantify whether using the properties of multiple galaxies simultaneously can tighten those constraints. For this, we train neural networks to perform likelihood-free inference on the value of two cosmological parameters (Ωm and σ8) and four astrophysical parameters using the properties of several galaxies from thousands of hydrodynamic simulations of the CAMELS project. We find that using properties of more than one galaxy increases the precision of the Ωm inference. Furthermore, using multiple galaxies enables the inference of other parameters that were poorly constrained with one single galaxy. We show that the same subset of galaxy properties are responsible for the constraints on Ωm from one and multiple galaxies. Finally, we quantify the robustness of the model and find that without identifying the model range of validity, the model does not perform well when tested on galaxies from other galaxy formation models.

<div> H+He TDE, 光变曲线, 天体物理, 光度测量, 恒星破坏

总结: 
该研究对H+He潮汐破坏事件（TDE）AT 2019azh进行了光度和光谱观测，并与公共光度数据相结合。研究发现，TDE的光变曲线斜率发生变化，且在峰值光变曲线中可能存在一个突起，这可能表明出现了多种主导发射机制。此外，研究还确认了先前TDE中观察到的现象，即红色发射比蓝色发射延迟峰值。该文还发现，AT 2019azh的峰值后玻尔光度曲线更适合以指数下降，而非经典的t−5/3（事实上，任何）幂定律下降。作者还提供了Hα发射线演化的最早测量结果，并发现V波段光度曲线峰值和Hα亮度峰值之间没有显著的时间延迟。这些结果可以用来约束未来的TDE线形成和发射机制模型。需要更多的TDE预峰值1-2天间隔观测来确定这些特征是否在TDE中普遍存在，并且需要详细的发射模型来充分利用这些观测来理解TDE的发射物理。 <div>
AT 2019azh is a H+He tidal disruption event (TDE) with one of the most extensive ultraviolet and optical data sets available to date. We present our photometric and spectroscopic observations of this event starting several weeks before and out to approximately 2 yr after the g-band's peak brightness and combine them with public photometric data. This extensive data set robustly reveals a change in the light-curve slope and a possible bump in the rising light curve of a TDE for the first time, which may indicate more than one dominant emission mechanism contributing to the pre-peak light curve. Indeed, we find that the MOSFiT-derived parameters of AT 2019azh, which assume reprocessed accretion as the sole source of emission, are not entirely self-consistent. We further confirm the relation seen in previous TDEs whereby the redder emission peaks later than the bluer emission. The post-peak bolometric light curve of AT 2019azh is better described by an exponential decline than by the canonical t−5/3 (and in fact any) power-law decline. We find a possible mid-infrared excess around the peak optical luminosity, but cannot determine its origin. In addition, we provide the earliest measurements of the Hα emission-line evolution and find no significant time delay between the peak of the V-band light curve and that of the Hα luminosity. These results can be used to constrain future models of TDE line formation and emission mechanisms in general. More pre-peak 1–2 days cadence observations of TDEs are required to determine whether the characteristics observed here are common among TDEs. More importantly, detailed emission models are needed to fully exploit such observations for understanding the emission physics of TDEs.

总结: 
Astro2020 Decadal Survey确定了对环绕星系的星系间介质（CGM；星系周围的气体等离子体）进行绘图的关键目标。研究人员探讨了利用未来的大口径X射线微量计来表征附近星系晕中和周围的CGM的前景。他们从流体动力学模拟（EAGLE、IllustrisTNG和Simba）中创建了现实的模拟观测结果，这些结果展示了广泛的潜在测量可能性，将解决星系形成和演化中的一些开放问题。通过在模拟观测中包括所有的背景和前景成分，研究人员展示了为什么用当前仪器（如X射线CCD）无法进行这些测量，以及为什么只有微量计才能让我们区分微弱的CGM发射线和明亮的银河系前景发射线。他们发现，根据流星形成速率，平均而言，银河系质量的个体晕可以被跟踪到较大的半径，大约R500，对于更大的星系甚至可达到R200，利用明显的发射线（如O vii或O viii）。此外，他们表明个体星系晕的发射线比例可以揭示径向温度结构。亚结构测量表明，将有可能将方位变化与星系的反馈模式联系起来。他们展示了通过谱线拟合构建个体星系晕的温度、速度和丰度比图，揭示了旋转特征、活跃星系核喷发和富集。 <br /><br /> <div>
The Astro2020 Decadal Survey has identified the mapping of the circumgalactic medium (CGM; the gaseous plasma around galaxies) as a key objective. We explore the prospects for characterizing the CGM in and around nearby galaxy halos with a future large-grasp X-ray microcalorimeter. We create realistic mock observations from hydrodynamical simulations (EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, and Simba) that demonstrate a wide range of potential measurements, which will address the open questions in galaxy formation and evolution. By including all background and foreground components in our mock observations, we show why it is impossible to perform these measurements with current instruments, such as X-ray CCDs, and why only microcalorimeters will allow us to distinguish the faint CGM emission from the bright Milky Way (MW) foreground emission lines. We find that individual halos of MW mass can, on average and depending on star formation rate, be traced out to large radii, around R500, and for larger galaxies even out to R200, using prominent emission lines, such as O vii, or O viii. Furthermore, we show that emission-line ratios for individual halos can reveal the radial temperature structure. Substructure measurements show that it will be possible to relate azimuthal variations to the feedback mode of the galaxy. We demonstrate the ability to construct temperature, velocity, and abundance ratio maps from spectral fitting for individual galaxy halos, which reveal rotation features, active galactic nucleus outbursts, and enrichment.

We present the construction of a deep multiwavelength point-spread-function-matched photometric catalog in the Ultra-Deep Survey (UDS) field following the final UKIDSS UDS release. The catalog includes photometry in 24 filters, from the MegaCam-uS 0.38 μm band to the Spitzer-IRAC 8 μm band, over ∼0.9 deg2 and with a 5σ depth of 25.3 AB in the K-band detection image. The catalog, containing ≈188,564 (136,235) galaxies at 0.2 < z < 8.0 with stellar mass and K-band total magnitude K < 25.2 (24.3) AB, enables a range of extragalactic studies. We also provide photometric redshifts, corresponding redshift probability distributions, and rest-frame absolute magnitudes and colors derived using the template-fitting code eazy-py. Photometric redshift errors are less than 3%−4% at z < 4 across the full brightness range in the K band and stellar mass range . Stellar population properties (e.g., stellar mass, star formation rate, dust extinction) are derived from the modeling of the spectral energy distributions using the codes FAST and Dense Basis.

太阳风质子, (β∥, T⊥/T∥) 相空间频率分布, 温度异向性驱动的等离子体不稳定性, 碰撞弛豫, 碰撞/集体效应的动力学计算
<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了太阳风质子在(β∥, T⊥/T∥)相空间中的频率分布特征，发现高β∥边界由温度异向性驱动的等离子体不稳定性部分解释，而低β∥边界与碰撞弛豫过程密切相关。Vafin等人的工作表明了碰撞弛豫频率νpp的等值线能与左侧边界匹配，表明碰撞弛豫过程与左侧边界形成关系密切。本文通过对质子的碰撞弛豫过程进行动力学计算，发现最终弛豫状态与观测到的边界吻合。结合集体不稳定性区域的计算，发现碰撞/集体效应提供了观测结果的基本解释。 <div>
The frequency distribution of solar wind protons, measured in the vicinity of Earth’s orbit, is customarily plotted in (β∥, T⊥/T∥) phase space. Here, T⊥/T∥ is the ratio of perpendicular and parallel temperatures, and β∥ = 8πnT∥/B2 is the ratio of parallel thermal energy to background magnetic field energy, the so-called “parallel beta,” with ⊥ and ∥ denoting directions with respect to the ambient magnetic field. Such a frequency distribution, plotted as a two-dimensional histogram, forms a peculiar rhombic shape defined with an outer boundary in the said phase space. Past studies reveal that the threshold conditions for temperature anisotropy–driven plasma instability partially account for the boundary on the high-β∥ side. The low-β∥ side remains largely unexplained despite some efforts. Work by Vafin et al. recently showed that certain contours of collisional relaxation frequency, νpp, when parameterized by T⊥/T∥ and β∥, could match the overall shape of the left-hand boundary, thus suggesting that the collisional relaxation process might be closely related to the formation of the left-hand boundary. The present paper extends the analysis by Vafin et al. and carries out the dynamical computation of the collisional relaxation process for an ensemble of initial proton states with varying degrees of anisotropic temperatures. The final states of the relaxed protons are shown to closely match the observed boundary to the left of the (β∥, T⊥/T∥) phase space. When coupled with a similar set of calculations for the ensemble in the collective instability regime, it is found that the combined collisional/collective effects provide the baseline explanation for the observation.

<div> ALMA, absorption lines, Galactic molecular gas, velocity components, chemical models
<br />总结:
该研究利用ALMA对QSO J1851+0035进行了观测，发现了17种分子，并对18种进行了上限设定。研究识别出20个独立的速度组分，推测具有τ≲1的组分对应于弥散云或云外缘。CO J = 1–0和J = 2–1吸收线的多高斯拟合显示这些组分由窄线和宽线组成。通过高HCN/HNC异构体比值推断的动力学温度达到了≳40 K，对应的热宽度解释了窄线组分的线宽。CN类分子和碳氢化合物之间有着密切和线性的相关性。CO/HCO+丰度比显示出数量级差距，较小的比值出现在较小的N(HCO+)（或较低的AV）范围内。一些速度组分在单天线CO发射和ALMA HCO+吸收中被探测到，但没有相应的ALMA CO吸收。这可能可以通过未能分辨的∼1 pc天线波束中的凝聚CO发射体混合周围具有极低CO/HCO+丰度比（即CO贫富）的扩展组分来解释。 <div>
Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) data toward QSO J1851+0035 (l = 33.°498, b = +0.°194) were used to study absorption lines by Galactic molecular gas. We detected 17 species (CO, 13CO, C18O, HCO+, H13CO+, HCO, H2CO, C2H, c-C3H, c-C3H2, CN, HCN, HNC, CS, SO, SiO, and C) and set upper limits to 18 species as reference values for chemical models. About 20 independent velocity components at 4.7–10.9 kpc from the Galactic center were identified. Their column density and excitation temperature estimated from the absorption study, as well as the CO intensity distributions obtained from the FUGIN survey, indicate that the components with τ ≲1 correspond to diffuse clouds or cloud outer edges. Simultaneous multiple-Gaussian fitting of CO J = 1–0 and J = 2–1 absorption lines shows that these are composed of narrow- and broad-line components. The kinetic temperature empirically expected from the high HCN/HNC isomer ratio (≳4) reaches ≳40 K and the corresponding thermal width accounts for the line widths of the narrow-line components. CN-bearing molecules and hydrocarbons have tight and linear correlations within the groups. The CO/HCO+ abundance ratio showed a dispersion as large as 3 orders of magnitude with a smaller ratio in a smaller N(HCO+) (or lower AV) range. Some of the velocity components are detected in single-dish CO emission and ALMA HCO+ absorption but without corresponding ALMA CO absorption. This may be explained by the mixture of clumpy CO emitters not resolved with the ∼1 pc single-dish beam surrounded by extended components with a very low CO/HCO+ abundance ratio (i.e., CO-poor gas).

总结: <br /><br />这篇论文讨论了湍流加热在黑洞吸积盘中对离子和电子的分配问题，指出了宏观和微观尺度之间的挑战性差距。研究发现，能量注入慢波和阿尔芬波级联之间的分配取决于受控于Maxwell和Reynolds应力张量的角动量传输、剪切速率和平均磁场方向。通过磁流体力学剪切盒模拟，得出了由磁旋不稳定引起的湍流应力张量的数值结果，并推导出慢波和阿尔芬波级联之间的注入功率比。最后，提出了一个基于宏观特征的局部子网格模型，用于计算离子与电子加热比。 <div>
The partition of turbulent heating between ions and electrons in radiatively inefficient accretion flows plays a crucial role in determining the observational appearance of accreting black holes. Modeling this partition is, however, a challenging problem because of the large scale-separation between the macroscopic scales at which energy is injected by turbulence and the microscopic ones at which it is dissipated into heat. Recent studies of particle heating from collisionless damping of turbulent energy have shown that the partition of energy between ions and electrons is dictated by the ratio of the energy injected into the slow and Alfvén wave cascades as well as the plasma β parameter. In this paper, we study the mechanism of the injection of turbulent energy into slow- and Alfvén-wave cascades in magnetized shear flows. We show that this ratio depends on the particular (rϕ) components of the Maxwell and Reynolds stress tensors that cause the transport of angular momentum, the shearing rate, and the orientation of the mean magnetic field with respect to the shear. We then use numerical magnetohydrodynamic shearing-box simulations with background conditions relevant to black hole accretion disks to compute the magnitudes of the stress tensors for turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability and derive the injection power ratio between slow and Alfvén wave cascades. We use these results to formulate a local subgrid model for the ion-to-electron heating ratio that depends on the macroscopic characteristics of the accretion flow.

<div> IC 3599, Seyfert 1.9, X-ray outburst, accretion-disk instability, Swift mission
<br />总结: 研究报告了对Seyfert 1.9星系IC 3599的跟踪观察，包括两次X射线爆发的发现和相关解释。第一次X射线爆发是在1990年由ROSAT发现的，第二次是在2010年由Swift发现的。有人假设IC 3599的爆发是由于重复的部分潮汐剥离引起的，预测了2019/2020年的再次爆发；另一种解释认为观察到的事件是由于吸积盘不稳定引起的，这意味着大爆发之间的时间间隔要长得多。Swift的持续监测不支持2019/2020年再次剧烈爆发的假设，而支持吸积盘不稳定的情景。此外，IC 3599的长期X射线光变曲线显示持续的强变化，2022年12月出现了X射线的小闪焰，随后X射线谱呈现出特殊的硬化。 <div>
We report on follow-up observations of the Seyfert 1.9 galaxy IC 3599 with the NASA Neil Gehrels Swift mission. The detection of a second X-ray outburst in 2010 by Swift after the first discovery of a bright X-ray outburst in 1990 by ROSAT led to the suggestion of two very different explanations. The first one assumed that IC 3599 exhibits outbursts due to repeated partial tidal stripping of a star, predicting another outburst of IC 3599 in 2019/2020. The second, alternative scenario assumed that the event observed in X-rays is due to an accretion-disk instability, which would suggest a much longer period between the large outbursts. Our continued monitoring campaign by Swift allowed us to test the first scenario that predicted a repetition of high-amplitude flaring activity in 2019/2020. We do not find any evidence of dramatic flaring activity with factors of 100 since the last X-ray outburst seen in 2010. These observations support the accretion-disk scenario. Further, while IC 3599 remains in low-emission states, the long-term X-ray light curve of IC 3599 reveals ongoing strong variability of a factor of a few. The most remarkable event is a miniflare of a factor of 10 in X-rays in 2022 December. After that flare, the otherwise supersoft X-ray spectrum shows an exceptional hardening, reminiscent of a temporary corona formation.

<div> 磁流体扭结、能量转换、电流片、几何结构、磁场重构<br />
<br />总结:<br />本研究通过对磁流体扭结和电流片的多重动态能量转换以及二维几何结构进行研究，发现在磁流体扭结中存在着不同的能量转换方式，主要是能量动力机在FR1和FR5中占主导地位，而在FR2-4中主要是能量耗散。在磁流体扭结周围观察到电磁场和等离子体之间的动态能量交换，以及薄电流片周围的能量动力机和能量耗散现象。通过磁场重构得出六个磁流体扭结的估计长宽比，以及薄电流片的厚度。研究结果表明，FR4是一个合并的磁流体扭结，其磁场图显示了明显的能量耗散现象。这一发现与之前的多个岛屿合并的模拟研究结果相符。 <div>
A series of six ion-scale magnetic flux ropes (FR1–6) and a thin current sheet, encountered by Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft in the magnetosheath side of the dayside magnetopause boundary layer, are studied for multiple flux rope dynamics in terms of energy conversion and two-dimensional geometry structure. The thin current sheet is identified in between FR1 and FR2. The energy exchange between electromagnetic fields and plasmas is dynamic in FR1–5 and also surrounding the flux ropes, while a low-energy conversion rate is seen in FR6. Different energy conversions exist in the flux ropes: energy dynamo is predominant in FR1 and FR5, while energy dissipation is dominated in FR2–4. Both the energy dynamo and dissipation primarily result from j∥E∥. Strong dissipation, surrounded by an energy dynamo, happens at the thin current sheet and is accompanied by ion agyrotropic behavior. From the reconstructed magnetic field maps, the estimated aspect ratios of the six flux ropes are 0.78, 0.16, 0.66, 0.11, 0.40, and 0.46 in order, and the thickness of the thin current sheet is ∼63 km (∼1.8 ion inertial length). Evidently, the magnetic field map shows that FR4 is a coalescing flux rope where a pronounced dissipation is present. The overall finding agrees with the previous simulation studies of multiple island coalescence.

总结:
本研究分析了在不同观测方法下，矮星系和大质量星系中低质量恒星初始质量函数(IMF)的银河级别变化。尽管不同方法存在系统性差异，但一个具有金属依赖斜率的低质量恒星IMF模型与大多数观测结果一致，表明宇宙中的恒星形成过程具有高度一致性。我们还强调了对低质量IMF变化的更全面理解的必要性，考虑到测量偏差和金属以外的因素。 <br /><br /> <div>
The stellar initial mass function (IMF) characterizes the mass distribution of newly formed stars in various cosmic environments, serving as a fundamental assumption in astrophysical research. Recent findings challenge the prevalent notion of a universal and static IMF, proposing instead that the IMF’s shape is contingent upon the star formation environment. In this study, we analyze the galaxy-wide variation in the IMF for low-mass stars in both dwarf and massive galaxies with diverse observational methods. Despite systematic discrepancies between different approaches, an IMF model with a metallicity-dependent slope for the low-mass stars aligns with the majority of observations, indicating a high degree of uniformity in the star formation processes across the Universe. We also emphasize the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the variation in the low-mass IMF, considering measurement biases and factors beyond metallicity.

这篇论文探讨了宇宙物理系统中常见的超音速等温湍流过程的能量。研究表明，守恒能量是动能（K）和Helmholtz自由能（F）的总和。研究人员预测了自由能P（F）和动能P（K）的概率分布，以及它们非平凡的联合分布P（F，K）。他们通过一系列驱动湍流模拟验证了这些预测，发现结果与预测非常吻合。模拟湍流的马赫数范围从1到8，并有三种驱动模式：纯螺旋型、纯压缩型和混合型。研究发现P（F）在F = 0处不连续，不连续性随着马赫数和压缩驱动而增加。P（K）类似于负偏态的对数正态分布。联合分布P（F，K）显示出双峰分布，气体要么存在于高F和高K，要么存在于低F和低K。 
<br /><br />总结: 这项研究探讨了超音速等温湍流的能量分布规律，提出了动能和Helmholtz自由能的概率分布，并通过模拟验证了这些预测。研究结果表明，湍流的能量分布在不同条件下存在不同的特征，为理解宇宙中湍流运动提供了重要参考。 <div>
Supersonic isothermal turbulence is a common process in astrophysical systems. In this work, we explore the energy in such systems. We show that the conserved energy is the sum of the kinetic energy (K) and Helmholtz free energy (F). We develop analytic predictions for the probability distributions, P(F) and P(K), as well as their nontrivial joint distribution, P(F, K). We verify these predictions with a suite of driven turbulence simulations, finding excellent agreement. The turbulence simulations were performed at Mach numbers ranging from 1 to 8, and three modes of driving: purely solenoidal, purely compressive, and mixed. We find that P(F) is discontinuous at F = 0, with the discontinuity increasing with Mach number and compressive driving. P(K) resembles a lognormal with a negative skew. The joint distribution, P(F, K), shows a bimodal distribution, with gas either existing at high F and high K or at low F and low K.

<div> 中间质量黑洞（IMBHs），BHMF，ERDF，活动星系核（AGNs），活跃分数

总结: 该研究调查了黑洞质量函数（BHMF）和厄丁顿比分布函数（ERDF），着重关注质量低至M•∼104M⊙的中间质量黑洞（IMBHs）。通过对红移z<0.35的已探测到宽Hα发射线的活动星系核（AGNs）进行研究，构建了包括243个IMBHs（M•<106M⊙）在内的14242个AGN样本。通过最大后验估计联合建模BHMF和ERDF，发现BHMF在∼106M⊙处峰值，并在低质量端呈现相对恒定值10-4 Mpc-3 dex-1。通过将type 1 AGNs的BHMF与基于更新的黑洞质量-宿主星系恒星质量关系的星系质量函数进行比较，推导出活跃分数。同时，利用type 1分数的上限和下限确定所有AGNs的活跃分数。对于质量较大的星系（M⋆>1010M⊙），活跃分数下降至15%–40%，对于M⋆∼108M⊙的侏儒星系，下降至低于∼2%。这些结果表明，如果IMBHs和超大质量黑洞的工作周期相似，质量较低星系（M⋆∼108.5–109M⊙）的黑洞占据分数预计将达到∼50%。 <div>
We investigate the black hole mass function (BHMF) and the Eddington ratio distribution function (ERDF), focusing on the intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with masses down to M• ∼ 104 M⊙. Based on the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with a detected broad Hα emission line, we construct a sample of 14,242 AGNs at redshift z < 0.35, including 243 IMBHs with M• < 106 M⊙. By jointly modeling the BHMF and ERDF via the maximum posterior estimation, we find that the BHMF peaks at ∼106 M⊙ and exhibits a relatively constant value of 10−4 Mpc−3 dex−1 at the low-mass end. By comparing the derived BHMF of type 1 AGNs with the galaxy mass function based on the updated black hole mass–host galaxy stellar mass relation, we derive the active fraction. We also determine the active fraction for all AGNs using the upper and lower limit of the type 1 fraction. The active fraction decreases from 15%–40% for massive galaxies (M⋆ > 1010 M⊙) to lower than ∼2% for dwarf galaxies with M⋆ ∼ 108 M⊙. These results suggest that the black hole occupation fraction is expected to be ∼50% for low-mass galaxies (M⋆ ∼ 108.5–109 M⊙) if the duty cycle is similar between IMBHs and supermassive black holes.

<div> 聚合物，极化特性，星际尘埃，形状修剪，X射线散射
总结:
本文研究了45种非凸形状的聚合物，它们都是由N个大小相等的球体聚合而成的。研究者考虑了三种不同的聚集方案，分别为N = 2，N = 3和N = 256个随机聚合物以及通过系统修剪初始随机聚合物来增加扁平化或拉长的“修剪”N = 256个聚合物。研究发现，唯一与星光极化和极化热辐射观察一致的形状是那些被修剪以增加其不对称性的形状。文章指出，如果恒星间尘埃颗粒是高孔隙度的聚合物，则必须存在可以导致极端拉长或扁平化的过程；否则，恒星间尘埃颗粒必然由相当紧凑的结构主导，最多具有中等孔隙度。文章还指出，在10微米硅酸盐特征的极化与光学范围内的星光极化的比率对孔隙度和形状不敏感。X射线散射可能是确定恒星间尘埃颗粒孔隙度的最佳工具。研究者提出，恒星间尘埃颗粒的适度孔隙度可能是“光解致密化”的结果。一些0级恒星核中观察到的高极化分数需要在密集区域中减少孔隙度和/或增加聚合物不对称性进行处理。 <div>
A previous study (Paper I) investigated the polarization properties of a variety of simple convex grain shapes, some of which were found to be consistent with the observed polarization properties of interstellar dust from far-ultraviolet to far-infrared. Here, we study the optical properties of 45 nonconvex shapes, all aggregates of N equal-sized spheres. We consider N = 2, N = 3, and N = 256 random aggregates obtained from three different aggregation schemes. We also consider “trimmed” N = 256 aggregates obtained by systematically trimming initially random aggregates to increase either flattening or elongation. The “macroporosities” of the studied aggregates range from (for the N = 2 bisphere) to (for the N = 256 “BA” aggregates). The only aggregates consistent with observations of starlight polarization and polarized thermal emission are shapes that have been trimmed to increase their asymmetry. If interstellar grains are high-porosity aggregates, there must be processes causing extreme elongation or flattening; if not, interstellar grains must be dominated by fairly compact structures, with at most moderate porosities. The ratio of polarization in the 10 μm silicate feature to starlight polarization in the optical is shown to be insensitive to porosity and shape. X-ray scattering may be the best tool to determine the porosity of interstellar grains. We propose that modest porosities of interstellar grains could be the result of “photolytic densification.” High polarization fractions observed in some Class 0 cores require processes to reduce porosities and/or increase asymmetries of aggregates in dense regions.

总结:<br /><br />本研究使用了跨越30年的GOES磁力计数据，研究了地球同步轨道上Pc5超低频波的分布情况。应用了CLEAN算法来检测狭窄带宽的Pc5波，发现在磁场对齐坐标系中每个磁场分量中接近3万个事件。在磁局部时间（MLT）方向的波发生频率在18-23 MLT区域最高，但最大的波幅出现在白昼附近午时附近。波幅随着太阳风活跃度的增加而增大，而径向和平行分量的波幅在太阳风磁场时钟角为-30°至-45°时最大。得到的Pc5超低频波事件数据库可用于约束辐射带模型，而CLEAN方法提供了一种在磁层和其他领域自动检测窄带等离子体波的独特技术。 <div>
Using GOES magnetometer data spanning over 30 yr, we study the distribution of Pc5 ultralow-frequency waves at geosynchronous orbit. The CLEAN algorithm was applied to detect narrowband Pc5 waves. This method was first used in astronomical radio interferometry, but has since been applied to many other areas. The algorithm allows for identification of multiple individual peaks within the same power spectral density. We found close to 30,000 events in each magnetic field component in field-aligned coordinates. With some exceptions, results were in agreement with previous studies. Wave occurrence along magnetic local time (MLT) was higher in the 18–23 MLT sector. However, the largest accumulated wave amplitudes were observed on the dayside, peaking close to local noon. As expected, wave amplitudes were larger during more active solar wind conditions. For the radial and parallel components, amplitudes were maximum at the interplanetary magnetic field clock angle of −30° to −45°. The resultant database of Pc5 ultralow-frequency wave events can be used to constrain radiation belt models, while the CLEAN method provides a unique technique to automatically detect narrowband plasma waves in the magnetosphere and beyond.

The Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public (NGDEEP) survey program was designed specifically to include Near Infrared Slitless Spectroscopic observations (NGDEEP-NISS) to detect multiple emission lines in as many galaxies as possible and across a wide redshift range using the Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph. We present early results obtained from the first set of observations (Epoch 1, 50% of the allocated orbits) of this program (NGDEEP-NISS1). Using a set of independently developed calibration files designed to deal with a complex combination of overlapping spectra, multiple position angles, and multiple cross filters and grisms, in conjunction with a robust and proven algorithm for quantifying contamination from overlapping dispersed spectra, NGDEEP-NISS1 has achieved a 3σ sensitivity limit of 2 × 10−18 erg s−1 cm−2. We demonstrate the power of deep wide field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) to characterize the star formation rates, and metallicity ([O iii]/Hβ), and dust content, of galaxies at 1 < z < 3.5. The latter showing intriguing initial results on the applicability and assumptions made regarding the use of Case B recombination. Further, we identify the presence of active galactic nuclei and infer the mass of their supermassive black holes using broadened restframe Mg ii and Hβ emission lines. The spectroscopic results are then compared with the physical properties of galaxies extrapolated from fitting spectral energy distribution models to photometry alone. The results clearly demonstrate the unique power and efficiency of WFSS at near-infrared wavelengths over other methods to determine the properties of galaxies across a broad range of redshifts.

本研究利用第三代斯隆数字天文巡天/重子振荡光谱巡天（BOSS）的CMASS北银道帽样本进行推断，目的是对中微子质量进行限制。我们利用空洞大小函数、空洞-星系交叉功率谱和星系自相关功率谱进行推断。通过模拟基于隐式似然推断的方法，使用了粒子-中微子宇宙学模拟中的丰富暗物质分布模型。在保守的尺度下，我们从星系自相关功率谱和完整数据向量中找到了中微子质量∑mν的上限为0.43和0.35电子伏特（95%可信区间）。放松尺度限制后，我们得到了0.28和0.32电子伏特的结果。总体而言，空洞统计似乎为自相关功率谱添加了适度但非零的信息。我们还证实了空洞大小函数呈泊松分布的假设。 
<br /><br />总结: 本研究使用斯隆数字天文巡天数据对中微子质量进行了限制，利用空洞统计和隐式似然推断方法得出了中微子质量的上限。结果表明空洞统计似乎在一定程度上为对中微子质量的推断提供了额外信息。 <div>
Cosmic voids identified in the spatial distribution of galaxies provide complementary information to two-point statistics. In particular, constraints on the neutrino mass sum, ∑mν, promise to benefit from the inclusion of void statistics. We perform inference on the CMASS Northern Galactic Cap sample of the third-generation Sloan Digital Sky Survey/Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) with the aim of constraining ∑mν. We utilize the void size function, the void–galaxy cross power spectrum, and the galaxy auto power spectrum. To extract constraints from these summary statistics we use a simulation-based approach, specifically implicit likelihood inference. We populate approximate gravity-only, particle-neutrino cosmological simulations with an expressive halo occupation distribution model. With a conservative scale cut of and a Planck-inspired Lambda cold dark matter prior, we find upper bounds on ∑mν of 0.43 and 0.35 eV from the galaxy auto power spectrum and the full data vector, respectively (95% credible interval). Relaxing the scale cut to , we find 0.28 and 0.32 eV. Generally, void statistics appear to add modest but nonzero information beyond the auto power spectrum. We also substantiate the usual assumption that the void size function is Poisson distributed.

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), often attributed to massive star collapse or binary compact object mergers, exhibit diverse emission characteristics hinting at multiple GRB classes based on various factors like progenitors, radiation mechanisms, and central engines. This study employs unsupervised clustering using the nested Gaussian mixture model algorithm to analyze data from Fermi and BATSE, identifying four classes (A–D) based on duration, spectral peak, and spectral index of time-integrated spectra of GRBs. Class proportions are approximately 70%, 10%, 3%, and 17%, respectively, with A and B comprising mostly long GRBs, C mainly short GRBs, and D encompassing both types. The classes are further assessed based on spectral index α, indicating distinct radiation mechanisms: α > −0.67 for photospheric emission, α ≤ −1.5 for fast-cooling synchrotron, and −1.5 < α ≤ −0.67 for slow-cooling synchrotron. Classes B and C align with photospheric emission, while A and D predominantly exhibit synchrotron radiation. Short GRBs are predominantly photospheric emission, whereas long GRBs tend to favor synchrotron emission. Overall, 63% of the total bursts exhibit α profiles indicative of synchrotron emission, with the remaining 37% associated with photospheric emission. Considering the limited data of kilonova and supernova associated with GRBs, classes are examined for progenitor origins, suggesting a hybrid nature for A and D, and collapsar and merger origins for B and C, respectively. This clustering analysis results in four GRB classes, which, upon investigation, reveal the diverse and complex nature of GRBs in terms of their radiation, duration, and progenitor.

<br /><br />总结:
这篇文章讨论了原行星盘中固体颗粒的径向漂移对行星形成的影响。通常认为固体颗粒的径向漂移会威胁行星的形成，因为它会在颗粒组装成行星之前将它们从盘中移除。然而，径向漂移可能也会在盘中特定位置集中固体颗粒，从而加速凝聚过程。研究发现，在一些情况下，行星体可能会向外漂移，而不是向内。这导致盘中存在一些半径作为行星体的稳定吸引体。研究还发现，即使考虑到行星体尺寸的广泛差异，这可能会导致行星体表面密度增加超过一个数量级。 <div>
Radial drift of solid particles in the protoplanetary disk is often invoked as a threat to planet formation, as it removes solid material from the disk before it can be assembled into planets. However, it may also concentrate solids at particular locations in the disk, thus accelerating the coagulation process. Planetesimals are thought to drift much faster in an eccentric disk, due to their higher velocities with respect to the gas, but their drift rate has only been calculated using approximate means. In this work, we show that in some cases previous estimates of the drift rate, based on a modification of the results for an axisymmetric disk, are highly inaccurate. In particular, we find that under some easily realized circumstances, planetesimals may drift outwards, rather than inwards. This results in the existence of radii in the disk that act as stable attractors of planetesimals. We show that this can lead to a local enhancement of more than an order of magnitude in the surface density of planetesimals, even when a wide dispersion of planetesimal size is considered.

Recent JWST eclipse spectra of the high-density hot Saturn HD 149026b between 2.35 and 5.08 μm have allowed for in-depth study of its atmosphere. To understand its atmospheric properties, we have created a grid of 1D radiative-convective–thermochemical–equilibrium atmosphere models and spectra with PICASO 3.0. In agreement with previous work, we find that the presence of gaseous TiO creates a thermal inversion, which is inconsistent with the data. The presence of gaseous VO, however, which condenses at temperatures 200 K cooler, does not cause such inversions but alters the temperature–pressure profile of the atmosphere. We estimate an atmospheric metallicity of solar without VO and solar with VO, a factor of ∼10 times smaller than previous work from Bean et al., who relied on atmosphere retrievals. We attribute this significant difference in metallicity to a larger temperature gradient at low pressures in radiative equilibrium models. Such models with lower metallicities readily fit the strong CO2 feature at 4.3 μm. Our lower estimated metallicity makes HD 149026b more consistent with the mass–metallicity relationship for other giant planets. We find a C/O ratio of with and without VO. The best-fit heat redistribution factor without VO is 1.17, a very high value suggesting very little dayside energy transport and no energy transport to the nightside. The heat redistribution factor shrinks to a more plausible value of , with VO, which we regard as circumstantial evidence for the molecule in the atmosphere of HD 149026b.

本研究利用Solar Orbiter和Parker Solar Probe的观测数据，结合磁流体模型，对快速太阳风和慢Alfvénic太阳风的组成和变化进行了研究。通过对离子组成、电离态比率等多方面的分析，成功验证了模型和实测数据相结合的有效性，并确定了来自小赤道区冕洞的两条快速太阳风流，和来自冕洞边界的高Alfvénicity慢太阳风流的特征。这项研究充分展示了多种仪器和数据的综合研究对于太阳风来源的重要性。 <div>
We seek to understand the composition and variability of fast solar wind (FSW) and slow Alfvénic solar wind emerging from coronal holes (CHs). We leverage an opportune conjunction between Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe (PSP) during PSP Encounter 11 to include compositional diagnostics from the Solar Orbiter Heavy Ion Sensor as these variations provide crucial insights into the origin and nature of the solar wind. We use potential field source surface and magnetohydrodynamic models to connect the observed plasma at PSP and Solar Orbiter to its origin footpoint in the photosphere and compare these results with the in situ measurements. A very clear signature of a heliospheric current sheet crossing as evidenced by enhancements in low first ionization potential (FIP) elements, ion charge state ratios, proton density, low Alfvénicity, and polarity estimates validates the combination of modeling, data, and mapping. We identify two FSW streams emerging from small equatorial CHs with low ion charge state ratios, low FIP bias, high Alfvénicity, and low footpoint brightness, yet anomalously low alpha particle abundance for both streams. We identify high-Alfvénicity slow solar wind emerging from the overexpanded boundary of a CH having intermediate alpha abundance, high Alfvénicity, and dips in ion charge state ratios corresponding to CH boundaries. Through this comprehensive analysis, we highlight the power of multi-instrument conjunction studies in assessing the sources of the solar wind.

<title>A Temperature or Far-ultraviolet Tracer? The HNC/HCN Ratio in M83 on the Scale of Giant Molecular Clouds</title>

<div> 高分辨率观测、星系M83、HNC/HCN比率、星际物质、紫外辐射

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了HNC/HCN比率在星系M83中的观测，以及它与星际物质和紫外辐射的关系。研究发现，在星系中心区域，HNC/HCN比率随着星形率的增加而升高，而在条状末端区域，HNC/HCN比率与星形率、星形效率和柱密度无关。这一结果与之前关于HNC/HCN比率随温度升高而降低的假设不符。通过对光谱形状的分析，结果表明这一趋势可能是由于HCN的光学厚和HNC的光学薄所致。此外，在条状末端区域，通过对远红外比值的尘埃温度和HNC/HCN比率的大尺度（约200pc）相关性的比较，发现HNC/HCN比率与尘埃温度呈负相关，表明HNC/HCN比率取决于影响低柱密度星际介质的紫外辐射场。 <div>
The HNC/HCN ratio is observationally known as a thermometer in Galactic interstellar molecular clouds. A recent study has alternatively suggested that the HNC/HCN ratio is affected by the ultraviolet (UV) field, not by the temperature. We aim to study this ratio on the scale of giant molecular clouds in the barred spiral galaxy M83 towards the southwestern bar end and the central region from Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations, and if possible, distinguish the above scenarios. We compare the high-resolution (40–50 pc) HNC/HCN ratios with the star formation rate from the 3 mm continuum intensity and the molecular mass inferred from the HCN intensities. Our results show that the HNC/HCN ratios do not vary with the star formation rates, star formation efficiencies, or column densities in the bar-end region. In the central region, the HNC/HCN ratios become higher with higher star formation rates, which tend to cause higher temperatures. This result is not consistent with the previously proposed scenario in which the HNC/HCN ratio decreases with increasing temperature. Spectral shapes suggest that this trend may be due to optically thick HCN and optically thin HNC. In addition, we compare the large-scale (∼200 pc) correlation between the dust temperature from the far-IR ratio and the HNC/HCN ratio for the southwestern bar-end region. The HNC/HCN ratio is lower when the dust temperatures are higher. We suggest from the above results that the HNC/HCN ratio depends on the UV radiation field that affects the interstellar medium on the ∼100 pc scale where the column densities are low.

<div> 关键词: 红超巨星(RSGs), Magellanic Clouds, GP回归, 颗粒化参数, 金属丰度

总结:<br />
这篇文章系统地研究了在麦哲伦云中红超巨星(RSGs)的颗粒化现象。首先对RSG样本进行了前景星和可能被错误标识的源的检查，然后对光变曲线进行了排除异常值和光度质量的检查。接着采用高斯过程回归(GP)来建模颗粒化，应用马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛方法来推导颗粒化幅度σ和无阻尼振荡器的周期ρ，以及阻尼时间尺度τ。然后通过计算无量纲品质因子Q对RSGs进行进一步分析。结合颗粒化参数和恒星参数，建立了稳健的时间尺度ρ的缩放关系，而幅度σ的缩放关系则由分段函数表示，可能与暗淡RSGs的幅度趋向某个特定值有关。通过比较小麦哲伦云和大麦哲伦云的结果，证实随着金属丰度的增加，振幅和时间尺度也会变大。在两个星系之间的缩放关系方面，发现ρ几乎不受金属丰度的影响，而σ受金属丰度的影响更为显著。文章还比较了GP方法和颗粒化的周期图拟合，讨论了它们各自的优势。 <div>
The granulation of red supergiants (RSGs) in the Magellanic Clouds is systematically investigated by combining the latest RSG samples and light curves from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment and the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae. The present RSG samples are first examined for foreground stars and possible misidentified sources, and the light curves are sequentially checked to remove the outliers by white noise and photometric quality. The Gaussian process (GP) regression is used to model the granulation, and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo is applied to derive the granulation amplitude σ and the period of the undamped oscillator ρ, as well as the damping timescale τ. The dimensionless quality factor Q is then calculated through Q = πτ/ρ. RSGs around are considered to have significant granulation signals and are used for further analysis. Combining granulation parameters with stellar parameters, robust scaling relations for the timescale ρ are established, while the scaling relations for amplitude σ are represented by a piecewise function, possibly related to the tendency of amplitudes in faint RSGs to converge toward a certain value. Comparing results between the Small Magellanic Cloud and the Large Magellanic Cloud confirms that amplitudes and timescales become larger with metallicity. In examining the scaling relations between the two galaxies, it is found that ρ is nearly independent of metallicity, whereas σ is more significantly affected by metallicity. The GP method is compared with the periodogram fitting of the granulations, and the advantages of either are discussed.

<title>A New Timescale–Mass Scaling for the Optical Variation of Active Galactic Nuclei across the Intermediate-mass to Supermassive Scales</title>

The variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) has long been servicing as an essential avenue of exploring the accretion physics of a black hole (BH). There are two commonly used methods for analyzing AGN variability. First, the AGN variability, characterized by the structure function (SF) of a single band, can be well described by a damped random walk (DRW) process on timescales longer than ∼weeks, shorter than which departures have been reported. Second, the color variation (CV) between two bands behaves timescale dependent, raising challenges to the widely accepted reprocessing scenario. However, both the departure from the DRW process and the timescale-dependent CV are hitherto limited to AGNs, mainly quasars, at the supermassive scale. Here, utilizing the high-cadence multiwavelength monitoring on NGC 4395 harboring an intermediate-mass BH, we unveil at the intermediate-mass scale for the first time, prominent departures from the DRW process at timescales shorter than ∼hours in all three nights and bands, and plausible timescale-dependent CVs in the two longest nights of observation. Furthermore, comparing SFs of NGC 4395 to four AGNs at the supermassive scale, we suggest a new scaling relation between the timescale (τ; across nearly 3 orders of magnitude) and the BH mass (MBH): where the exponent γ is likely ≃0.6–0.8. This exponent differs from most previous measurements, but confirms a few, and is consistent with a recent theoretical prediction, suggesting a similar accretion process in AGNs across different mass scales.

In this paper, we introduce a U-Net model of deep learning algorithms for reconstructions of the 3D peculiar velocity field, which simplifies the reconstruction process with enhanced precision. We test the adaptability of the U-Net model with simulation data under more realistic conditions, including the redshift space distortion effect and halo mass threshold. Our results show that the U-Net model outperforms the analytical method that runs under ideal conditions, with a 16% improvement in precision, 13% in residuals, 18% in correlation coefficient, and 27% in average coherence. The deep learning algorithm exhibits exceptional capacities to capture velocity features in nonlinear regions and substantially improve reconstruction precision in boundary regions. We then apply the U-Net model trained under Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) observational conditions to the SDSS Data Release 7 data for observational 3D peculiar velocity reconstructions.

<title>Discriminating between Babcock–Leighton-type Solar Dynamo Models by Torsional Oscillations</title>

The details of the dynamo process in the Sun are an important aspect of research in solar-terrestrial physics and astrophysics. The surface part of the dynamo can be constrained by direct observations, but the subsurface part lacks direct observational constraints. The torsional oscillations, a small periodic variation of the Sun's rotation with the solar cycle, are thought to result from the Lorentz force of the cyclic magnetic field generated by the dynamo. In this study, we aim to discriminate between three Babcock–Leighton dynamo models by comparing the zonal acceleration of the three models with the observed one. The property that the poleward and equatorward branches of the torsional oscillations originate from about ±55° latitudes with their own migration time periods serves as an effective discriminator that could constrain the configuration of the magnetic field in the convection zone. The toroidal field, comprising poleward and equatorward branches separated at about ±55° latitudes, can generate the two branches of the torsional oscillations. The alternating acceleration and deceleration bands in time are the other property of the torsional oscillations that discriminates between the dynamo models. To reproduce this property, the phase difference between the radial (Br) and toroidal (Bϕ) components of the magnetic field near the surface should be about π/2.

We here focus on the behavior of supernovae that technically explode in 1D (spherical symmetry). When simulated in 3D, however, the outcomes of representative progenitors of this class are quite different in almost all relevant quantities. In 3D, the explosion energies can be 2 to 10 times higher, and there are correspondingly large differences in the 56Ni yields. These differences between the 3D and 1D simulations reflect in part the relative delay to explosion of the latter and in the former the presence of protoneutron star convection that boosts the driving neutrino luminosities by as much as ∼50% at later times. In addition, we find that the ejecta in 3D models are more neutron-rich, resulting in significant weak r-process and 48Ca yields. Furthermore, we find that in 3D the core is an interesting, though subdominant, source of acoustic power. In summary, we find that though a model might be found theoretically to explode in 1D, one must perform supernova simulations in 3D to capture most of the associated observables. The differences between 1D and 3D models are just too large to ignore.

We compare mock ultraviolet C ii and Si ii absorption and emission line features generated using a ∼109M⊙ virtual galaxy with observations of 131 z ∼ 3 galaxies from the vandels survey. We find that the mock spectra reproduce reasonably well a large majority (83%) of the vandels spectra (χ2 < 2), but do not resemble the most massive objects (⪆1010 M⊙), which exhibit broad absorption features. Interestingly, the best-matching mock spectra originate from periods of intense star formation in the virtual galaxy, where its luminosity is 4 times higher than in periods of relative quiescence. Furthermore, for each galaxy, we predict the Lyman continuum (LyC) escape fractions ( ) using the environment of the virtual galaxy. We derive an average of 0.01 ± 0.02, consistent with other estimates from the literature. The are tightly correlated with the Lyα escape fractions and highly consistent with observed empirical trends. Additionally, galaxies with larger exhibit bluer β slopes, more Lyα flux, and weaker low-ionization absorption lines. Building upon the good agreement between and observationally established LyC diagnostics, we examine the LyC leakage mechanisms in the simulation. We find that LyC photon leakage is enhanced in directions where the observed flux dominantly emerges from compact regions depleted of neutral gas and dust, mirroring the scenario inferred from observational data. In general, this study further highlights the potential of high-resolution radiation hydrodynamics simulations in analyzing UV absorption and emission line features and providing valuable insights into the LyC leakage of star-forming galaxies.

总结:
通过对Serpens South原行星团和延伸的纤维的密集气体进行观测和分析，发现大部分密集核是超维特性的，而位于纤维中的核主要是由引力束缚的。这些核无法形成恒星，除非它们获得额外的质量或其内部运动减少。南部纤维显示了明显的速度梯度，可能因为向星团的质量流动。北部纤维的运动更加复杂。观察发现非热运动与气体温度存在强相关性，这种加热和星团驱动的流出与密集气体的相互作用可能是导致增加非热运动的原因。假设一定比例的核质量最终会形成年轻恒星，未来Serpens South原行星团中的星际气体将会转向更高的质量形成恒星。 <br /><br /> <div>
Most stars form in clusters and groups rather than in isolation. We present ≲5″ angular resolution (∼2000 au, or 0.01 pc) Very Large Array NH3 (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3) and 1.3 cm continuum emission observations of the dense gas within the Serpens South protocluster and extended filaments to the north and south. We identify 94 dense cores using a dendrogram analysis of the NH3 (1,1) integrated intensity. Gas temperatures TK and nonthermal line widths σNT both increase toward the center of the young stellar cluster, in the dense gas generally and in the cores specifically. We find that most cores (54%) are supervirial, with gravitationally bound cores located primarily in the filaments. Cores in the protocluster have higher virial parameters by a factor of ∼1.7, driven primarily by the increased core σNT values. These cores cannot collapse to form stars unless they accrete additional mass or their core internal motions are reduced. The southern filament shows a significant velocity gradient previously interpreted as mass flow toward the cluster. We find more complex kinematics in the northern filament. We find a strong correlation between σNT and TK, and argue that the enhanced temperatures and nonthermal motions are due to mechanical heating and interaction between the protocluster-driven outflows and the dense gas. Filament-led accretion may also contribute to the increased σNT values. Assuming a constant fraction of core mass ends up in the young stars, future star formation in the Serpens South protocluster will shift to higher masses by a factor of ∼2.

<div> quasar, luminosity function, black holes, cosmic evolution, accretion<br />
<br />总结:<br />本文通过理论模型描述了黑洞从初期种子阶段到大约4的生长过程，考虑了吸积期间的持续时间、Eddington比率分布，以及BH吸积速率的质量依赖性。通过4≤z≤6范围内的观测到的QLF，约束了模型参数，发现高红移BH群体在z≳6时迅速增长，随后速度减缓。向较低红移（z<6）方向，质量相关吸积抑制了M•>10^8M⊙的高质量BH的增长，导致M•≳10^10M⊙时出现质量饱和。我们预测了4≤z≤11时BH质量函数，为未来观测提供了基准。这些发现还表明了早期BH-星系质量相关的两个不同路径：BH/星际质量比接近本地值M•/M⋆≃ 5×10^-3的群体通过适度增长保持相关性，而在本地相关性之上开始增长的群体则在z∼6时成为超质量，达到M•/M⋆∼0.01-0.1。 <div>
The evolution of the quasar luminosity function (QLF) is fundamental to understanding the cosmic evolution of black holes (BHs) through their accretion phases. In the era of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), Euclid, and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, their unprecedented detection sensitivity and wide survey area can unveil the low-luminosity quasar and low-mass BH population, and provide new insights into quasar host galaxies. We present a theoretical model describing BH growth from initial seeding at z ≳ 20 to ∼ 4, incorporating the duration of accretion episodes, the distribution of Eddington ratios, and the mass dependency of BH accretion rates. By constraining the model parameters with the observed QLFs at 4 ≤ z ≤ 6 across a wide UV luminosity range, we find that the high-redshift BH population grows rapidly at z ≳ 6, and decelerates the pace in subsequent epochs. Toward lower redshifts (z < 6), mass-dependent accretion inhibits the growth of high-mass BHs with M• > 108M⊙, leading to mass saturation at M• ≳ 1010M⊙. We predict the BH mass function down to M• ∼ 106M⊙ for both unobscured and obscured quasar populations at 4 ≤ z ≤ 11, offering a benchmark for future observational tests. Our model accounts for the presence of both bright and faint quasars at z > 4, including those discovered by JWST. Furthermore, our findings suggest two distinct pathways for the early assembly of the BH–galaxy mass correlation: the population with a BH-to-stellar-mass ratio near the local value of M•/M⋆ ≃ 5 × 10−3 maintains proximity to the relation via moderate growth, while the population that begins to grow above the local relation becomes as overmassive as M•/M⋆ ∼ 0.01–0.1 by z ∼ 6 via rapid mass accretion.

总结: <br />这项研究关注孤立矮椭球星系中恒星反馈的数值模拟，结果显示恒星反馈会导致最近的星形成停滞。模拟结果与Leo II的观测数据相匹配，但在恒星年龄和金属丰度分布上存在差异，暗示了宇宙中的气体输入可能在塑造矮椭球星系中扮演更为复杂的角色。研究结果表明，目前停滞的矮星系不一定需要在星团或星系团内演化，恒星反馈可能足以塑造这些星系。 <div>
A fundamental question regarding the evolution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies is the identification of the key physical mechanisms responsible for gas depletion. Here, we focus on the study of stellar feedback in isolated dwarf spheroidal galaxies by performing numerical simulations using a modified version of the smoothed-particle hydrodynamics code GADGET-3. The Milky Way satellite Leo II (PGC 34176) in the Local Group was considered as our default model dwarf galaxy. The parameter space for the stellar feedback models was explored to match observational constraints of Leo II, such as residual gas mass, total mass within the tidal radius, star formation history, final stellar mass, stellar ages, and metallicity. Additionally, we examined the impact of the binary fraction of stars, initial mass function, dark matter halo mass, and initial gas reservoir. Many simulations revealed recent star formation quenching due to stellar feedback. In general, the gas depletion, expected star formation history, total mass of stars, and total mass within the tidal radius were adequately reproduced in the simulations when compared to observational estimates. However, there were discrepancies in the distribution of stellar ages and metallicities, which suggested that the cosmic gas infall would play a more complex role in our dwarf spheroidal galaxy than captured by a monolithic infall scenario. Our results suggest that currently quenched dwarf galaxies may not necessarily need to evolve within clusters or groups and that stellar feedback alone could be a sufficient factor in shaping at least some of these galaxies as we observe them today.

双白矮星在确定年龄时，光谱观测并不能明显提高精度。光度确定的大气参数拟合比巴尔末线拟合能给出更好的总年龄一致性。此外，还发现了大量双白矮星存在融合现象，这对于初始-终结质量关系的推断产生了影响。建议在确定白矮星年龄时，进行光谱鉴定以确保使用正确的大气模型进行光度拟合，以得到最准确的总年龄。 <br /><br />总结: 双白矮星的年龄确定中，光谱观测并未提高精度，光度确定的大气参数拟合更好；存在大量融合现象对初始-终结质量关系影响显著；建议进行光谱鉴定以确保使用正确的大气模型进行光度拟合。 <div>
White dwarf stars have been used for decades as precise and accurate age indicators. This work presents a test of the reliability of white dwarf total ages when spectroscopic observations are available. We conduct follow-up spectroscopy of 148 individual white dwarfs in widely separated double-white-dwarf (WD+WD) binaries. We supplement the sample with 264 previously published white dwarf spectra, as well as 1292 high-confidence white dwarf spectral types inferred from their Gaia XP spectra. We find that spectroscopic fits to optical spectra do not provide noticeable improvement to the age agreement among white dwarfs in wide WD+WD binaries. The median age agreement is ≈1.5σ for both photometrically and spectroscopically determined total ages, for pairs of white dwarfs with each having a total age uncertainty < 20%. For DA white dwarfs, we further find that photometrically determined atmospheric parameters from spectral energy distribution fitting give better total age agreement (1.0σ, 0.2 Gyr, or 14% of the binary’s average total age) compared to spectroscopically determined parameters from Balmer-line fits (agreement of 1.5σ, 0.3 Gyr, or 28% of binary’s average total age). We find further evidence of a significant merger fraction among wide WD+WD binaries: across multiple spectroscopically identified samples, roughly 20% are inconsistent with a monotonically increasing initial–final mass relation. We recommend the acquisition of an identification spectrum to ensure the correct atmospheric models are used in photometric fits in order to determine the most accurate total age of a white dwarf star.

<div> 关键词: 太阳能粒子，时间序列，NASA帕克太阳探测器，自相似性指数，自然时间波动

总结:<br /><br />本文利用NASA帕克太阳探测器的数据集，通过Hurst重整化范围R/S分析、去趋势波动分析、居中移动平均分析和自然时间波动的研究方法，研究了太阳能粒子时间序列的长期持续性。通过交叉相关分析，模拟了背景系统噪声，并从原始数据中减去。这四种方法的应用使我们能够区分安静太阳期和活跃太阳期，识别活动的开始并在最大太阳能粒子通量达到之前揭示活动的有趣细节。还首次根据自然时间波动的熵变化估计了未来风暴的最大太阳能粒子通量。 <div>
We investigate the long-term persistence of solar energetic particle (SEP) time series by means of four different methods: Hurst rescaled range R/S analysis, detrended fluctuation analysis, centered moving average analysis, and the fluctuation of natural time under the time reversal method. For these analyses, we use data sets from the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun instrument suite on board NASA's Parker Solar Probe. Background systematic noise is modeled using cross-correlation analysis between different SEP energy channels and subtracted from the original data. The use of these four methods for deriving the time-series persistence allows us to (i) differentiate between quiet- and active-Sun periods based on the values of the corresponding self-similarity exponents alone; (ii) identify the onset of an ongoing activity well before it reaches its maximum SEP flux; (iii) reveal an interesting fine structure when activity is observed; and (iv) provide, for the first time, an estimate of the maximum SEP flux of a future storm based on the entropy change of natural time under time reversal.

<div> 关键词: Periodic density structures, solar wind, mesoscale structures, multispacecraft observations, IMF intensity<br />
总结: <br />
本研究探讨了太阳风密度结构的周期性变化，发现了两种不同尺度的周期性结构，并通过仿真推断了它们的大小范围。该研究是首个针对磁场强度周期性变化与PDS相关性的统计研究。通过对太阳风密度和磁场强度的观测和分析，为约束模型和深入了解PDS与磁层耦合关系提供了重要信息。 <br /> <div>
Periodic density structures (PDSs) are quasiperiodic variations of solar wind density ranging from a few minutes to a few hours. PDSs advect with the solar wind and have radial length scales (Lx) of tens to several thousand megameters, thus belonging to the class of “mesoscale structures.” Current interplanetary multispacecraft observations are not at spatial separations capable of directly measuring the 3D size scale of PDSs or other mesoscale structures. Instead, previous investigations estimated characteristic spatial scales in solar wind parameters using cross-correlation and/or coherence analysis applied to multispacecraft observations. For the solar wind density and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) intensity, the reported size scales perpendicular to the Sun–Earth line (Ly) ranged between ≈30 and ≈200 Earth Radii (RE). Here, we implemented a similar approach for the same parameters, but focused on high-density, slow-solar-wind intervals with PDSs observed by the Wind and ARTEMIS-P1 spacecraft. Additionally, this is the first statistical study of the IMF intensity periodicities in relation to PDSs. We identified intervals in which the two spacecraft observed the same periodicity, obtaining two PDS groups based on their radial length scale: Lx1 ≈ 86RE and Lx2 ≈ 35RE. Then, we classified the events based on the periodic variations’ coherence level. Reproducing the results with simulations of the PDSs’ transit, we inferred the Ly order of magnitudes for the two PDS groups: Ly1 ≈ 340RE and Ly2 ≈ 187RE. Knowing the PDSs’ size scales is fundamental for constraining models aimed at reproducing these structures and is critical for better understanding the PDS–magnetosphere coupling.

Of the about 300 gas-phase molecular species so far detected in the interstellar medium (ISM), mostly via observations of their rotational lines, around 40% contain nitrogen (N) atoms. Likewise, of the less than a dozen interstellar molecules, firmly or likely detected in the solid-state water-dominated icy matrix by means of infrared observations, two bear N. A crucial parameter that regulates whether a species is in the gas or adsorbed on the icy phase is their binding energy (BE) toward the icy grain. Therefore, an accurate quantification of the BE is of paramount importance to properly model the ISM chemistry through numerical models. However, very few BEs are available in the literature, either determined experimentally or theoretically. In the present study, we calculate the BEs of 21 among the most abundant interstellar N-bearing species. We adopted two structural water ice models, representing a crystalline and an amorphous surface, using a reliable cost-effective procedure based on the density functional theory. While on the crystalline surface model only one BE per species is obtained due to the high symmetry of the unit cell, on the amorphous model from 5 to 10 BEs are obtained, due to its richer surface morphological variety. Most of our computed BEs agree with available experimental and other computational values. Finally, we discuss how the newly computed BEs can help estimate which N-bearing species can be frozen at the water snow line and, therefore, incorporated in water-rich ice planetesimals.

总结:
该研究利用500米口径球面射电望远镜(FAST)对蜘蛛脉冲星J1816+ 4510进行了射电日食特性的观测。研究发现，随着频率的增加，脉冲星J1816+ 4510的日食出射比入射时间更长，且呈现出更对称的现象。此外，观测还表明，由于伴星的散射作用，脉冲轮廓在日食区域进一步变宽。研究还发现，日食期间的射电脉冲模糊主要受到散射的影响，而不是色散度测量的波动。这些观测结果有助于理论研究蜘蛛脉冲星系统的射电日食机制。 <div>
We report on the radio eclipse properties of spider pulsar J1816+4510 using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The high-sensitivity FAST observations will allow us to probe much deeper into the eclipse region of this pulsar at higher frequencies >1 GHz. The duration of the full eclipse, eclipse ingress, and egress at 1100, 1200, 1300, and 1400 MHz are measured, respectively. The variation of eclipse duration with frequency is studied by splitting the FAST observations into four subbands. It is found that the eclipse egress of PSR J1816+4510 takes longer than the ingress and becomes more symmetrical with increasing frequency. The variations of the durations with the frequency for the full eclipse, eclipse ingress, and egress follow a power-law decay pattern with different indices. The pulse profile variations near the eclipse are studied. It is found that the broadening of pulse profiles becomes more prominent with deepening into the eclipse region due to the scattering from the companion star. Moreover, the pulse smearing induced by the scattering and the rapid dispersion measure (DM) fluctuations within a subintegration during the eclipse egress at different frequencies and orbital phases is comparatively studied. It is found that the scattering plays a more important role than the DM fluctuations for the pulse smearing of the eclipse. The observations of this paper will provide important clues for the theoretical studies of the radio eclipse mechanism of the spider pulsar systems.

<title>The 2018 Outburst of MAXI J1820+070 as Seen by Insight-HXMT</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present an analysis of the whole 2018 outburst of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 with Insight-HXMT data. We focus our study on the temporal evolution of the parameters of the source. We employ two different models to fit the disk’s thermal spectrum: the Newtonian model diskbb and the relativistic model nkbb. These two models provide different pictures of the source in the soft state. With diskbb, we find that the inner edge of the disk is close to the innermost stable circular orbit of a fast-rotating black hole and the corona changes geometry from the hard to the soft state. With nkbb, we find that the disk is truncated in the soft state and that the coronal geometry does not change significantly during the whole outburst. However, the model with nkbb can predict an untruncated disk around a fast-rotating black hole if we assume that the disk inclination angle is around 30° (instead of ∼60°, which is the inclination angle of the jet and is usually adopted as the disk inclination angle in the literature) and we employ a high-density reflection model. In such a case, we measure a high value of the black hole spin parameter with observations in the soft state, in agreement with the high spin value found from the analysis of the reflection features and in disagreement with the low spin value found by previous continuum-fitting method measurements with the disk inclination angle set to the value of the jet inclination angle.

<title>Frequency-dispersed Ion Acoustic Waves in the Near-Sun Solar Wind: Signatures of Impulsive Ion Beams</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work reports a novel plasma wave observation in the near-Sun solar wind: frequency-dispersed ion acoustic waves. Similar waves have previously been reported in association with interplanetary shocks or planetary bow shocks, but the waves reported here occur throughout the solar wind sunward of ∼60 solar radii, far from any identified shocks. The waves reported here vary their central frequency by factors of 3–10 over tens of milliseconds, with frequencies that move up or down in time. Using a semiautomated identification algorithm, thousands of wave instances are recorded during each near-Sun orbit of the Parker Solar Probe spacecraft. Wave statistical properties are determined and used to estimate their plasma frame frequency and the energies of protons most likely to be resonant with these waves. Proton velocity distribution functions are explored for one wave interval, and proton enhancements that may be consistent with proton beams are observed. A conclusion from this analysis is that properties of the observed frequency-dispersed ion acoustic waves are consistent with driving by cold, impulsively accelerated proton beams near the ambient proton thermal speed. Based on the large number of observed waves and their properties, it is likely that the impulsive proton beam acceleration mechanism generating these waves is active throughout the inner heliosphere. This may have implications for the acceleration of the solar wind.

<title>Does the Correlation between 2MRS Galaxies and the CMB Indicate an Unmodeled CMB Foreground?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We revisit the claimed detection of a new cosmic microwave background (CMB) foreground based on the correlation between low-redshift Two Micron All Sky Survey Redshift Survey (2MRS) galaxies and CMB temperature maps from the Planck and Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe missions. We reproduce the reported measurements but argue that the original analysis significantly underestimated the uncertainties. We cross-correlate the 2MRS galaxy positions with simulated CMB maps and show that the correlation measured with the real data for late-type spiral galaxies at angular scales θ ≥ 0.°1 and redshift cz < 4500 km s−1 is consistent with zero at the 1.7σ level or less, depending on the exact CMB map and simulation construction. This was the sample that formed the basis for the original detection claim. For smaller angular separations the results are not robust to galaxy type or CMB cleaning method, and we are unable to draw firm conclusions. The original analysis did not propose a specific, falsifiable physical correlation mechanism, and it is impossible to rule out any contribution from an underlying physical effect. However, given our calculations, the lack of signal from expanding the redshift range, and the lack of corroboration from other galaxy surveys, we do not find the evidence for a new CMB foreground signal compelling.

<title>Formation Pathways of the Compact Stellar Systems</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The formation pathways of compact stellar systems (CSSs) are still under debate. We utilize the NewHorizon simulation to investigate the origins of such objects in the field environment. We identified 55 CSS candidates in the simulation whose properties are similar to those of the observed ultracompact dwarfs and compact ellipticals (cEs). All but two most massive objects (cE candidates) are a result of a short starburst. Sixteen are formed by tidal stripping, while the other 39 are intrinsically compact from their birth. The stripped objects originate from dwarf-like galaxies with a dark halo, but most of their dark matter is stripped through their orbital motion around a more massive neighbor galaxy. The 39 intrinsically compact systems are further divided into associated or isolated groups, depending on whether they were born near a massive dark halo or not. The isolated intrinsically compact objects (seven) are born in a dark halo and their stellar properties are older and metal-poor compared to the associated counterparts (32). The stripped compact objects occupy a distinct region in the age–metallicity plane from the intrinsically compact objects. The associated intrinsically compact objects in our sample have never had a dark halo; they are the surviving star clumps of a massive galaxy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The X-ray morphologies of clusters of galaxies display significant variations, reflecting their dynamical histories and the nonlinear dependence of X-ray emissivity on the density of the intracluster gas. Qualitative and quantitative assessments of X-ray morphology have long been considered a proxy for determining whether clusters are dynamically active or “relaxed.” Conversely, the use of circularly or elliptically symmetric models for cluster emission can be complicated by the variety of complex features realized in nature, spanning scales from megaparsecs down to the resolution limit of current X-ray observatories. In this work, we use mock X-ray images from simulated clusters from The Three Hundred project to define a basis set of cluster image features. We take advantage of the clusters’ approximate self-similarity to minimize the differences between images before encoding the remaining diversity through a distribution of high-order polynomial coefficients. Principal component analysis then provides an orthogonal basis for this distribution, corresponding to natural perturbations from an average model. This representation allows novel, realistically complex X-ray cluster images to be easily generated, and we provide code to do so. The approach provides a simple way to generate training data for cluster image analysis algorithms and could be straightforwardly adapted to generate clusters displaying specific types of features or selected by physical characteristics available in the original simulations.

A single-lined spectroscopic orbit for the M giant in the X-ray binary IGR J16194−2810 is determined from a time series of optical spectra. The spectroscopic orbital period of 192.5 days is twice that of the photometric period, confirming that the M giant in the system is an ellipsoidal variable. The giant is identified as a first ascent giant approaching the red giant tip. The primary is a neutron star (NS) with its M giant companion filling its Roche lobe, verifying the system classification as a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB). Stellar C, N, O, and Fe abundances are derived for the M giant with the C, N, and O values typical for a field giant with [Fe/H] = −0.14. The system does not have a large kick velocity. Models for the evolution of the system into a binary NS–white dwarf are presented. The X-ray properties are discussed in the context of this model. This binary is a rare example of a luminous, long orbital period LMXB early in the transient ellipsoidal phase.

We report an analysis of a sample of 186 spectroscopically confirmed Type II supernova (SN) light curves (LCs) obtained from a combination of Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System observations. We implement a method to infer physical parameters from these LCs using hydrodynamic models that take into account the progenitor mass, the explosion energy, and the presence of circumstellar matter (CSM). The CSM is modeled via the mass-loss rate, wind acceleration at the surface of the progenitor star with a β velocity law, and the CSM radius. We also infer the time of explosion, attenuation (AV), and the redshift for each SN. Our results favor low-mass progenitor stars (MZAMS < 14 M⊙) with a dense CSM ( > 10−3M⊙ yr−1, CSM radius ∼ 1015 cm, and β > 2). Additionally, we find that the redshifts inferred from the SN LCs are significantly more accurate than those inferred using the host galaxy photometric redshift, suggesting that this method could be used to infer more accurate host galaxy redshifts from large samples of Type II SNe in the LSST era. Lastly, we compare our results with similar works from the literature.

This study investigates the properties of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter using the relativistic Brueckner–Hartree–Fock formalism, examining both zero and finite temperatures up to 70 MeV. Employing the full Dirac space, we incorporate three Bonn potentials (A, B, and C), which account for meson masses, coupling strengths, cutoff parameters, and form factors. The calculated properties of asymmetric nuclear matter form the basis for constructing equation-of-state (EOS) models tailored for neutron stars. These models, in turn, enable the computation of bulk properties for nonrotating, uniformly rotating, and differentially rotating neutron stars. Notably, the EOS models studied in this paper are sufficiently versatile to accommodate the mass of the most massive neutron star ever detected, PSR J0952–0607, estimated to be 2.35 ± 0.17 M⊙. Furthermore, they yield masses and radii for PSR J0030+451 that align with the confidence intervals established for this pulsar.

We present continuum observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array of 10 high-redshift (2.2 ≤ z ≤ 2.7) ultraluminous quasars (QSOs) and constrain the presence of hot, ionized, circumgalactic gas in a stacking analysis. We measure a Compton-y parameter profile with a peak value of (1.7 ± 1.1) × 10−6 at a radius of ∼50 kpc. We compare our stacked observations to active galactic nucleus feedback wind models and generalized Navarro–Frenk–White pressure profile models to constrain the wind luminosity and halo mass of the stacked QSOs. Our observations constrain the observed average halo mass to M500 < 1 × 1013M⊙ and the average feedback wind power <1 × 1012L⊙, which is <1% of the bolometric luminosity of the quasar.

<div> 关键词: 星流, 银河系, 磁盘倾斜, 数值实验, 暗物质<br />
总结: <br />
本研究通过数值实验发现，银河系磁盘的倾斜会对星流的形态和运动学产生影响。倾斜率为15° Gyr−1时，对Pal 5的潮尾模型与观测结果吻合良好，可解释潮尾的明显变窄现象。另外，未考虑倾斜磁盘可能会导致对银河系局部暗物质分布形状参数的约束出现5%–10%的偏差，不同星流的偏差方向也不同。磁盘倾斜可能解释不同星流推断银河系暗物质晕形状时出现的不一致现象。 <div>
Stellar streams are sensitive tracers of the gravitational potential, which is typically assumed to be static in the inner Galaxy. However, massive mergers like Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus can impart torques on the stellar disk of the Milky Way that result in the disk tilting at rates of up to 10°–20° Gyr−1. Here, we demonstrate the effects of disk tilting on the morphology and kinematics of stellar streams. Through a series of numerical experiments, we find that streams with nearby apocenters (rapo ≲ 20 kpc) are sensitive to disk tilting, with the primary effect being changes to the stream’s on-sky track and width. Interestingly, disk tilting can produce both more diffuse streams and more narrow streams, depending on the orbital inclination of the progenitor and the direction in which the disk is tilting. Our model of Pal 5's tidal tails for a tilting rate of 15° Gyr−1 is in excellent agreement with the observed stream’s track and width, and reproduces the extreme narrowing of the trailing tail. We also find that failure to account for a tilting disk can bias constraints on shape parameters of the Milky Way’s local dark matter distribution at the level of 5%–10%, with the direction of the bias changing for different streams. Disk tilting could therefore explain discrepancies in the Milky Way’s dark matter halo shape inferred using different streams.

The luminosities (L) and velocity dispersions (σ) of the extinction-corrected Balmer emission lines of giant H ii regions in nearby galaxies exhibit a tight correlation (∼0.35 dex scatter). There are few constraints, however, on whether giant H ii regions at significant look-back times follow an L–σ relation, given the angular resolution and sensitivity required to study them individually. We measure the luminosities and velocity dispersions of Hα and Hβ emission from 11 H ii regions in Sp1149, a spiral galaxy at redshift (z) z = 1.49 multiply imaged by the MACS J1149 galaxy cluster. Sp1149 is also the host galaxy of the first-known strongly lensed supernova with resolved images, SN Refsdal. We employ archival Keck I OSIRIS observations, and newly acquired Keck I MOSFIRE and Large Binocular Telescope LUCI long-slit spectra of Sp1149. When we use the GLAFIC simply parameterized lens model, we find that the Hα luminosities of the H ii regions at z = 1.49 are a factor of brighter than predicted by the low-redshift L–σ relation we measure from Very Large Telescope MUSE spectroscopy. If the lens model is accurate, then the H ii regions in Sp1149 differ from their low-redshift counterparts. We identify an H ii region in Sp1149 that is dramatically brighter (by 2.03 ± 0.44 dex) than our low-redshift L–σ relation predicts given its low velocity dispersion. Finally, the H ii regions in Sp1149 are consistent, perhaps surprisingly, with the z ≈ 0 star-forming locus on the Baldwin–Phillips–Terlevich diagram.

We present the first systematic X-ray pulse timing analysis of the six members of the so-called “Magnificent Seven” nearby thermally emitting isolated neutron stars (XINS) with detected pulsations. Using the extensive collection of archival XMM-Newton, Chandra, and NICER observations spanning over two decades, we obtain the first firm measurement of the spin-down rate for RX J2143.0+0654, while for the rest we improve upon previously published spin ephemerides and extend them by up to an additional decade. Five of the XINS follow steady spin-down with no indication of major anomalies in their long-term timing behavior; the notable exception is RX J0720.4−3125, for which, in addition to confirming the previously identified glitch, we detect a second spin derivative. The high-quality folded X-ray pulse profiles produced with the updated timing solutions exhibit diverse and complex morphologies, as well as striking energy dependence. These peculiarities cannot be readily explained by blackbody-like isotropic emission and simple hot-spot configurations, hinting at the presence of complex multitemperature surface heat distributions and highly anisotropic radiation patterns, such as may arise from a strongly magnetized atmospheric layer.

总结:
通过在PETRA III 同步辐射装置的P04光束线上使用电子束离子阱对Fe xvii离子进行共振激发，我们将强软X射线跃迁的能量精度提高了4-20倍。结合高分辨率光电子能谱仪，我们同时跟踪瞬时光子能量波动，将系统不确定性最小化至10-15毫电子伏特，相当于速度误差±∼5 km s−1，大大提高了我们对这一关键天体物理离子的认识。我们的大规模相互作用计算包括400万多个相对论构型，并且与实验结果达到了前所未有的一致性，使得电子间相互关联的理论误差远远小于量子电动力学（QED）修正。这一QED基准测试增强了我们对未来对其他复杂原子离子的天体物理、等离子体物理和高电荷离子光钟的计算的信任。 <br /><br /> <div>
We improve by a factor of 4–20 the energy accuracy of the strongest soft X-ray transitions of Fe xvii ions by resonantly exciting them in an electron beam ion trap with a monochromatic beam at the P04 beamline of the PETRA III synchrotron facility. By simultaneously tracking instantaneous photon-energy fluctuations with a high-resolution photoelectron spectrometer, we minimize systematic uncertainties down to 10–15 meV, or velocity equivalent ±∼5 km s−1 in their rest energies, substantially improving our knowledge of this key astrophysical ion. Our large-scale configuration-interaction computations include more than 4 million relativistic configurations and agree with the experiment at a level without precedent for a 10-electron system. Thereby, theoretical uncertainties for interelectronic correlations become far smaller than those of quantum electrodynamics (QED) corrections. The present QED benchmark strengthens our trust in future calculations of many other complex atomic ions of interest to astrophysics, plasma physics, and the development of optical clocks with highly charged ions.

Numerical simulations of test particle transport in the presence of synthetic turbulence with known properties still provide the most reliable estimations of the diffusion coefficients of charged particles in turbulent space plasmas available. The development and implementation of such simulations, however, are far from straightforward. The present study provides a comprehensive treatment of the development and testing of such a simulation code, detailing the simulation of synthetic turbulence and diffusion coefficients, as well as various numerical tests to validate code output. Furthermore, a novel test for such codes is proposed, namely, the transport of charged particles in pure slab turbulence, which proves sensitive to numerical factors prior tests remain insensitive to.

本研究研究了四次日冕物质抛射（CMEs）的形成，这些CMEs源自同源喷射。所有的喷射都来自2012年7月2日的NOAA活跃区（AR）11515，在约14小时内发生。所有的CME都是宽阔的（角宽度约为95°至150°），并且在LASCO日冕仪图像中以约300至500 km/s的速度传播。在Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly图像的各种EUV波长观察中发现，在所有情况下，喷射的源区位于AR 11515的前部边界，该区域在每次事件发生前都有一小团丝状物。基于非线性自由力磁场外推的日冕磁场建模表明，在每种情况下，丝状物都被包含在一个由上面的紧凑环所约束的磁通绳内。丝状物的南方支点都扎根于喷发起始发生的负极区。这个负极区经历持续的磁通变化，包括在磁通绳附近相反极性的涌现和取消，EUV图像显示在每次喷发前丝状物的东南支点附近出现明亮现象。因此，这些磁通的变化很可能是随后喷发的原因。这四次同源喷发都源自AR的正极部分连接到两个遥远的负极区的两个大规模环系统的相邻支点，对太阳日冕产生了大规模影响。<br /><br />总结: 本研究研究了四次同源喷发的形成，它们都源自同一活跃区，喷发的速度和角宽度在特定范围内。通过对磁场建模和EUV图像的观察，发现了喷发前的磁通变化和明亮现象。这四次同源喷发都源自两个大规模环系统的相邻支点，并对太阳日冕产生了大规模影响。 <div>
We study the formation of four coronal mass ejections (CMEs) originating from homologous blowout jets. All of the blowout jets originated from NOAA Active Region (AR) 11515 on 2012 July 2, within a time interval of ≈14 hr. All of the CMEs were wide (angular widths ≈ 95°–150°), and propagated with speeds ranging between ≈300 and 500 km s−1 in LASCO coronagraph images. Observations at various EUV wavelengths in Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly images reveal that in all the cases, the source region of the jets lies at the boundary of the leading part of AR 11515 that hosts a small filament before each event. Coronal magnetic field modeling based on nonlinear force-free extrapolations indicates that in each case, the filament is contained inside of a magnetic flux rope that remains constrained by overlying compact loops. The southern footpoint of each filament is rooted in the negative polarity region where the eruption onsets occur. This negative polarity region undergoes continuous flux changes, including emergence and cancellation with opposite polarity in the vicinity of the flux rope, and the EUV images reveal brightening episodes near the filament’s southeastern footpoint before each eruption. Therefore, these flux changes are likely the cause of the subsequent eruptions. These four homologous eruptions originate near adjacent feet of two large-scale loop systems connecting from that positive polarity part of the AR to two remote negative polarity regions, and result in large-scale consequences in the solar corona.

Magnetic reconnection is an important physical process of energy conversion in the heliosphere. Parker Solar Probe (PSP) passes through current sheets of the inner heliosphere and is likely to encounter magnetic reconnection events there. PSP traversed a magnetic reconnection exhaust region that occurred in the coronal streamer during its perihelion Encounter 8. We report an observation of the counterstream of strahl electrons and compressible waves in the exhaust region on the antisunward side of the reconnection site. We analyze the wave characteristics using electromagnetic singular value decomposition techniques and find that the propagation direction of the compressible waves is quasi-perpendicular to the local magnetic field. Combining with the topology of the magnetic field, we infer that the compressible waves converge from the edge to the center of the exhaust region, and then propagate away from it. Further, we select 12 magnetic reconnection events during Encounter 5–8 for statistics and find that the oblique compressible waves are commonly detected throughout the inner heliospheric current sheet. In addition, we discuss the possible nature of wave branches for these compressible waves. Our work shows that magnetic reconnection in the heliosphere not only changes the topology of the large-scale magnetic field in the heliosphere, but also affects the transport characteristics of solar wind plasma and suprathermal particles, and regulates the states of waves and turbulence in the heliosphere.

<div> minihalos, reionization, Lyα forest, absorption, ionizing background intensity
<br /><br />总结:
本文是对微暗体对Lyα森林的影响进行了系统研究的首次尝试。通过进行1D辐射-流体力学模拟，首次得出了受紫外光蚀的微暗体的H i柱密度剖面。研究结果表明，在期望的离子化背景辐射下，微暗体对吸收体存在显著影响，会增加阻尼Lyα吸收体的发生率，并平均使Lyα流量减少约3%。此外，在解释z≳5.5的Lyα森林时，还需要考虑微暗体吸收的影响。通过对这些量的灵敏度进行研究，还可以对离子化背景辐射的强度进行限制。 <div>
Dense gas in minihalos with masses of 106−108M⊙ can shield themselves from reionization for ∼100 Myr after being exposed to the UV background. These self-shielded systems, often unresolved in cosmological simulations, can introduce strong absorption in quasar spectra. This paper is the first systematic study on the impact of these systems on the Lyα forest. We first derive the H i column density profile of photoevaporating minihalos by conducting 1D radiation–hydrodynamics simulations. We utilize these results to estimate the Lyα opacity from minihalos in a large-scale simulation that cannot resolve self-shielding. When the ionization rate of the background radiation is 0.03 × 10−12 s−1, as expected near the end of reionization at z ∼ 5.5, we find that the incidence rate of damped Lyα absorbers increases by a factor of ∼2−4 compared to at z = 4.5. The Lyα flux is, on average, suppressed by ∼3% of its mean due to minihalos. The absorption features enhance the 1D power spectrum up to ∼5% at k ∼ 0.1 h Mpc−1 (or 10−3 km−1 s), which is comparable to the enhancement caused by inhomogeneous reionization. The flux is particularly suppressed in the vicinity of large halos along the line-of-sight direction at separations of up to 10 h−1 Mpc at r⊥ ≲ 2 h−1 Mpc. However, these effects become much smaller for higher ionizing rates (≳0.3 × 10−12 s−1) expected in the post-reionization Universe. Our findings highlight the need to consider minihalo absorption when interpreting the Lyα forest at z ≳ 5.5. Moreover, the sensitivity of these quantities to the ionizing background intensity can be exploited to constrain the intensity itself.

<div> Swift GRBs, spectral lag, Lorentz invariance violation, energy bands, quantum-gravitational energy scale

总结: 本文研究了伽马射线爆发中光子的能量到达时间差异，发现多能量波段的光变曲线可以用于限制洛伦兹不变性的破坏程度。通过对90个具有红移信息的Swift GRB进行分析，得出了洛伦兹不变性破坏的上限，相当于量子引力能标的下限为EQG ≥ 2.2 × 1014GeV。这表明在高能天体物理现象中可能存在量子引力效应。 <div>
The arrival times of photons with different energy could be different, even when they are emitted from the same source simultaneously. Such a spectral lag is a common property among high-energy astrophysics phenomena like gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The potential violation of the Lorentz invariance caused by quantum fluctuations in background spacetime metrics could cause the spectral lag. In this paper, we try to make a constraint on Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) with multiple energy bands light curves of GRBs. With a sample of 90 Swift GRBs with redshifts, we calculate their spectral offsets from four fixed energy bands within their source frame. With help from the cross-correlation function and kernel smooth procedure, we extract improved spectral shifts. By using these more general spectral lags, we obtain an upper limit on LIV, equivalent to a lower limit on the quantum-gravitational energy scale of EQG ≥ 2.2 × 1014GeV.

The Galactic center lobe (GCL) is a ∼1° object located north of the Galactic center. In the mid-infrared, the GCL appears as two 8.0 μm filaments that roughly define an ellipse. There is strong 24 μm and radio continuum emission in the interior of the ellipse. Due to its morphology and location in the sky, previous authors have argued that the GCL is created by outflows from star formation in the central molecular zone or by activity of the central black hole Sgr A*. We present images of the GCL from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array survey in radio continuum that show thermal absorption against the Galactic center, incompatible with an interpretation of synchrotron self-absorption. Estimates of the cosmic-ray emissivity in this direction allow us to place a distance constraint on the GCL. To be consistent with standard emissivity assumptions, the GCL would be located 2 kpc away. At a distance of 8 kpc, the synchrotron background emissivity is enhanced by ∼75% in the direction of the GCL. We also present radio recombination line data from the Green Bank Telescope that constrain the electron temperature and line widths in this region, which are also more explicable if the GCL lies relatively close.

The Galactic center lobe (GCL) is an object ∼1° across that is located north of the Galactic center. In the mid-infrared (MIR) the GCL appears as two 8.0 μm filaments between which there is strong 24 μm and radio continuum emission. Due to its morphology and location in the sky, previous authors have argued that the GCL is located in the Galactic center region, created by outflows from star formation or by activity of the central black hole Sagittarius A*. In an associated paper, low-frequency radio emission indicates that the GCL must instead lie foreground to the Galactic center. If the GCL is foreground to the Galactic center, it is likely to be a type of object common throughout the Galactic disk; we here investigate whether its properties are similar to those of Galactic H ii regions. We find that the GCL’s MIR morphology, MIR flux densities, dust temperatures, and radio recombination line properties as traced by the Green Bank Telescope Diffuse Ionized Gas Survey are consistent with those of known Galactic H ii regions, although the derived electron temperature is low. We search for the ionizing source(s) of the possible H ii region and identify a stellar cluster candidate (Camargo #1092/Ryu & Lee #532) and a cluster of young stellar objects (the SPICY cluster G359.3+0.3) whose members have Gaia parallaxes distances of 1.7 ± 0.4 kpc. Taken together, the results of our companion paper and those shown here suggest that the GCL has properties consistent with those of an H ii region located ∼2 kpc from the Sun.

Sub-ion-scale magnetic holes play a significant role in electron transportation and energy dissipation. In the upstream region of the terrestrial bow shock, they are expected to originate from the upstream solar wind as well as the foreshock. The Moon can move into the solar wind; whether it can affect the observation of the sub-ion-scale magnetic holes is unclear. Here, we statistically investigate 268 sub-ion-scale magnetic holes in the lunar space environment based on observations of the Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence and Electrodynamics of the Moon’s Interaction with the Sun mission. The median duration of these magnetic holes is ∼0.31 s, and the median size of their cross sections is ∼0.5 ρi or ∼38.9 ρe. We regard an isolated or a train of magnetic holes as an event; thus, these magnetic holes belong to 207 events. The data at XSSE < 0 and |YSSE| < 2 RM (lunar radii) account for ∼21.7% of all observed data, but ∼89.4% of the events are observed in this region, suggesting that they are more likely to occur in the lunar wake. Furthermore, their occurrence rates in the lunar wake are much larger in the region close to its boundary than in other wake regions. And the occurrence rates in the lunar wake near the boundary at XSSE > −3 RM are larger in the dawnside than that in the duskside. These observations suggest that the region in the lunar wake close to its boundary is a possible source of sub-ion-scale magnetic holes.

本研究调查了[C/O]elem比率对碳同位素分馏的影响，发现当[C/O]elem比率超过1时，由于同位素交换反应，12CO/13CO比率可能低于元素碳同位素比率。TW Hya周围观测到的12CO/13CO和H12CN/H13CN比率可以在[C/O]elem比率为2-5时得到复制。在暖分子层的下边界附近，冰的形成导致气相[C/O]elem比率接近于1，从而减少了不同[C/O]elem比率下12CO/13CO比率的变化。总结: 本研究发现在TW Hya周围的盘中存在碳同位素分馏现象，其机制可以通过[C/O]elem比率为2-5时同位素选择性光解离和同位素交换反应来解释。 <div>
Carbon isotope fractionation of CO has been reported in the disk around TW Hya, where elemental carbon is more abundant than elemental oxygen ([C/O]elem > 1). We investigated the effects of the [C/O]elem ratio on carbon fractionation using astrochemical models that incorporate isotope-selective photodissociation and isotope exchange reactions. The 12CO/13CO ratio could be lower than the elemental carbon isotope ratio due to isotope exchange reactions when the [C/O]elem ratio exceeds unity. The observed 12CO/13CO and H12CN/H13CN ratios around TW Hya could be reproduced when the [C/O]elem ratio is 2–5. In the vicinity of the lower boundary of the warm molecular layer, the formation of ices leads to the gas-phase [C/O]elem ratio approaching unity, irrespective of the total (gas + ice) [C/O]elem ratio. This phenomenon reduces the variation in the 12CO/13CO ratio across different [C/O]elem ratios.

该研究利用 189 个存档 NuSTAR 观测数据，对来自24个源的X射线双星系统的黑洞自旋进行了分析。研究发现以前关于少数源自旋值低的报告通常是错误的，事实上这些源往往携带自旋值较高的黑洞。在 1σ 误差范围内，大约 86% 的样本的自旋值 ≥ 0.95，约 94% 的样本的自旋值 ≥ 0.9，而所有样本的自旋值均 ≥ 0.7。研究还发现高质量X射线双星系统与低质量X射线双星系统一致地显示出自旋值 ≥ 0.9，这与引力波事件中发现的黑洞的自旋值一致。研究还发现，在一些情况下，同一源的不同光谱产生相似的自旋测量结果，但关于内部盘倾斜度的值相互矛盾；作者提出这可能是由于变化的盘风遮挡了相对论性铁K发射线的蓝翼。作者讨论了测量结果的影响、他们的独特观点和未来利用新任务对黑洞自旋进行表征的努力。
<br /><br />总结: 通过对189个存档NuSTAR观测数据的分析，揭示了X射线双星系统中的恒星质量黑洞自旋值普遍较高，且高质量X射线双星系统与低质量X射线双星系统一致地显示出自旋值 ≥ 0.9。作者强调了结果的意义、揭示的系统误差以及在未来利用新任务对黑洞自旋进行表征的重要性。 <div>
We extend our recent work on black hole spin in X-ray binary systems to include an analysis of 189 archival NuSTAR observations from 24 sources. Using self-consistent data reduction pipelines, spectral models, and statistical techniques, we report an unprecedented and uniform sample of 36 stellar-mass black hole spin measurements based on relativistic reflection. This treatment suggests that prior reports of low spins in a small number of sources were generally erroneous: our comprehensive treatment finds that those sources tend to harbor black holes with high spin values. Overall, within 1σ uncertainty, ∼86% of the sample are consistent with a ≥ 0.95, ∼94% of the sample are consistent with a ≥ 0.9, and 100% are consistent with a ≥ 0.7 (the theoretical maximum for neutron stars; a = cJ/GM2). We also find that the high-mass X-ray binaries (those with A-, B-, or O-type companions) are consistent with a ≥ 0.9 within the 1σ errors; this is in agreement with the low-mass X-ray binary population and may be especially important for comparisons to black holes discovered in gravitational wave events. In some cases, different spectra from the same source yield similar spin measurements but conflicting values for the inclination of the inner disk; we suggest that this is due to variable disk winds obscuring the blue wing of the relativistic Fe K emission line. We discuss the implications of our measurements, the unique view of systematic uncertainties enabled by our treatment, and future efforts to characterize black hole spins with new missions.

<div> submillimeter galaxy, QSOs, Lyα nebula, KCWI, high redshift

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了一个包含亚毫米星系和两个背景QSO的系统，观测结果显示在该系统中存在一个延伸约180千秒差距的Lyα星云，该星云可能对应于穿过热暗物质晕的冷气流。文章还比较了两种不同环境中的Lyα星云，发现围绕QSOs的星云比围绕亚毫米星系的星云更亮，并展示出更陡的表面亮度分布。文章指出，尽管在亚毫米星系周围探测Lyα星云存在困难，但通过比较研究高红移星云的重要见解可获得重要见解。 <div>
The GAMA J0913−0107 system is a rare conjunction of a submillimeter galaxy (SMG) at z ≈ 2.7 and two background QSOs with projected separations <200 kpc. Previous high-resolution QSO absorption-line spectroscopy has revealed high H i column density, extremely metal-poor (∼1% solar) gas streams in the circumgalactic medium of the SMG. Here we present deep optical integral-field spectroscopy of the system with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI). Reaching a 2σ surface brightness limit ≈10−19 erg s−1 cm−2 arcsec−2 with ∼2 hr of integration time, we detect a filamentary Lyα nebula stretching ∼180 kpc from the SMG intercepting both QSO sightlines. This Lyα filament may correspond to the same cool gas stream penetrating through the hot halo seen in the absorption. In contrast to Lyα nebulae around QSOs, there is no obvious local source for photoionization due to the massive dust content. While uncertain, we consider the possibility that the nebula is ionized by shocks induced by the infall, obscured star formation, and/or a boosted UV background. The SMG–QSOs conjunction multiplied the efficiency of the KCWI observations, allowing a direct comparison of Lyα nebulae in two distinct environments. We find that the nebulae around the QSOs are much brighter and show steeper surface brightness profiles than the SMG nebula. This is consistent with the additional photoionization and Lyα scattering provided by the QSOs. While illustrating the challenges of detecting Lyα nebulae around SMGs, our work also demonstrates that important insights can be gained from comparative studies of high-z Lyα nebulae.

<br /><br />总结:
SGR 1935+2154是过去十年中最活跃的磁星，自2019年以来每年至少有一个活跃期。文章报道了2022年1月的活动，并呈现出观测到的112个X射线爆发的时间和时间积分光谱特性。这次活动持续约45天，爆发特性在活动期间没有显著的演变。文章指出，自2016年以来爆发的平均持续时间较短，光谱也逐渐变软，同时爆发通量和黑体发射半径逐渐增加。研究还发现，软成分开始变得更陡峭，而硬成分的趋势较为平缓。至今为止，观测到的爆发特性中没有显示出类似于2020年快速射电爆发FRB 200428的硬、长X射线对应物的特性。文章对这些结果进行了与源自2014年发现以来的8年历史的比较讨论。 <div>
The X-ray and radio burst-emitting soft gamma-ray repeater SGR 1935+2154 has been the most active magnetar during the past decade, with at least one active episode each year since 2019. We report on the 2022 January activity as observed by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor and present the temporal and time-integrated spectral properties of the observed 112 X-ray bursts. No radio bursts were reported during the activity. The mean burst duration is comparable to most of the previous activities but is shorter than that of 2020, during which the magnetar emitted radio bursts. The mean burst spectrum is softer than the earlier activities and a long-term softening trend since 2016 is evident and is accompanied by a rise in the mean burst fluence and blackbody emission radii. The power-law indices of the correlation also show an evolution during 2019–2022, where the soft component started becoming steeper, whereas the hard component shows a less steep trend. The burst properties show no significant evolution within the activity, which lasted for ∼ 45 days, and none of the observed bursts showed properties reminiscent of those of the hard, long X-ray counterpart to the 2020 fast radio burst FRB 200428 from the source. We discuss the results comparatively with the 8 yr history of the source since its discovery in 2014.

总结:
本研究探讨了活动星系核盘的外部、中部和内部区域中的吸积修饰星体(AMS)的特征，考虑了这些AMS在向内移动时的生长过程。我们计算了它们的多波段辐射能谱(SED)和热光曲线。结果显示，在中部区域发生的邦迪爆炸的热辐射可以导致UV耀斑，其光度约为10^44 erg/s。中部和内部区域邦迪爆炸的辐射峰值分别出现在X射线波段，光度约为10^43和10^42 erg/s。反康普顿辐射的γ射线光度范围从10^42–10^43 erg/s，在外部区域峰值约为10 MeV，在中部和内部区域峰值约为GeV。中部区域中AMS的可观测耀斑表现为缓慢上升和快速的高斯衰减，持续数月；而内部区域中表现为快速上升和缓慢的高斯衰减，持续数小时。这些不同的SED和光曲线特征为我们提供了有关活动星系核相关的各种天文短暂时间尺度的宝贵见解。 <div>
Stars and compact objects embedded in accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), dubbed accretion-modified stars (AMSs), often experience hyper-Eddington accretion in the dense gas environment, resulting in powerful outflows as the Bondi explosion and formation of cavities. The varying gas properties across different regions of the AGN disk can give rise to diverse and intriguing phenomena. In this paper, we conduct a study on the characteristics of AMSs situated in the outer, middle, and inner regions of the AGN disk, where the growth of the AMSs during the shift inward is considered. We calculate their multiwavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and thermal light curves. Our results reveal that the thermal luminosity of the Bondi explosion occurring in the middle region leads to UV flares with a luminosity of ∼1044 erg s−1. The synchrotron radiation of Bondi explosion in the middle and inner regions peaks at the X-ray band with luminosities of ∼1043 and ∼1042 erg s−1, respectively. The γ-ray luminosity of inverse Compton radiation spans from 1042–1043 erg s−1 peaked at the ∼10 MeV (outer region) and ∼GeV (middle and inner regions) bands. The observable flares of AMS in the middle region exhibit a slow rise and rapid Gaussian decay with a duration of months, while in the inner region, it exhibits a fast rise and slow Gaussian decay with a duration of several hours. These various SED and light-curve features provide valuable insights into the various astronomical transient timescales associated with AGNs.

总结:<br /><br />本文研究了双活动星系核的射电辐射特性，通过VLBA观测发现了四个双活动星系核系统中的八个射电成分。其中两个成分在解析尺度上清晰地检测到，其他六个成分被高分辨率成像所解析。我们提供了亮温度和射电发射功率的值或上限，并对每个目标的发射来源进行了详细分析。根据本工作和文献中报道的物理特性，我们建议J0051+0020B和J2300-0005A的射电发射主要来源于紧凑喷流，而其他六个源显示出更复杂的发射机制。此外，我们的VLBA观测表明，我们的双活动星系核样本中系统性的X射线缺陷可能是由潮汐诱发效应和可能的视角效应引起的。 <div>
It is believed that dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) form during galaxy mergers. Studying dual-AGN emission can provide valuable insights into galaxy merging and evolution. To investigate parsec-scale radio emission properties, we observed eight radio components of four selected dual-AGN systems using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 5 GHz in multiple-phase-center mode. Among them, two compact radio components, labeled J0051+0020B and J2300-0005A, were detected clearly on parsec scales for the first time. However, the radio emission of the other six components was resolved out in the high-resolution images. We provide the values or upper limits of the brightness temperature and radio emission power, and analyze the emission origins in detail for each target. Based on their physical properties reported in this work and in the literature, we suggest that the radio emission in J0051+0020B and J2300-0005A originates primarily from compact jets, while the other six sources show more complex emission mechanisms. In addition, our VLBA observations suggest that the systematic X-ray deficit in our dual-AGN sample is likely attributed to the tidally induced effect and possibly a viewing angle effect.

V2487 Ophiuchi (V2487 Oph) is a recurrent nova with classical nova eruptions in 1900 and 1998, and it is also the most extreme known superflare star. These superflares are roughly hour-long flares with amplitudes and optical energies reaching up to 1.10 mag and 1039.21 erg, respectively, with the superflares recurring once a day. The V2487 Oph superflares are certainly operating with the same mechanism as all the other types of superflare stars, where magnetic loops are twisted and stretched until reconnection occurs, whereupon ambient electrons are accelerated to relativistic energies and then emit bremsstrahlung radiation from X-ray to radio. V2487 Oph is unique among known superflare stars in that one of the loop footprints is in an accretion disk. This exact mechanism was theoretically predicted by M. R. Hayashi and colleagues in 1996. Now, I have found two superflares recorded on Harvard archival photographs from 1941 and 1942. These two superflares have B-magnitude amplitudes of >1.83 and >2.00 mag and total radiated energies of 1042.4 and 1042.5 erg, respectively, with bolometric corrections. Each has emitted energies of ∼30 billion Carringtons, in units of the most energetic solar flare. Further, I find superflares in Zwicky Transient Factory light curves, so V2487 Oph has been superflaring from 1941 to 2023. For the observed number distribution of dN/dE = 4E−2 superflares per year, for E in units of 1041 erg, the emitted energy in superflare light is 1042.1 erg in each year, or 1044.1 erg from 1941 to 2023.

C4H和c-C3H2是重要的不饱和碳氢化合物，它们在银河系的冷分子核中形成大型有机分子起着重要作用。通过IRAM 30m望远镜对19个邻近的冷分子核进行了C4H（N=9-8）线、c-C3H2（JKa,Kb=21,2-10,1）和H13CO+（J=1-0）的映射观测。在13个源中检测到了C4H 9-8，而在18个源中检测到了c-C3H2。在冷分子核中普遍存在的C4H和c-C3H2分子提供了形成大型有机分子的物质。发现了C4H 9-8和c-C3H2 2-1之间不同的空间分布。在假定局部热力学平衡条件下使用固定激发温度得到了这三种分子的相对丰度。C4H与c-C3H2的丰度比在不同源中的范围从0.34±0.09到G032.93+02到4.65±0.50的G008.67+22。发现了C4H/H13CO+和c-C3H2/H13CO+丰度比之间的微弱相关性，相关系数为0.46，这表明C4H和c-C3H2分子之间没有紧密的天体化学联系。 <br /><br />总结: C4H和c-C3H2在冷分子核中普遍存在，为大型有机分子的形成提供了物质。它们的空间分布不同，丰度比在不同源中有所变化，丰度比之间存在微弱相关性，但并没有紧密的天体化学联系。 <div>
C4H and c-C3H2, as unsaturated hydrocarbon molecules, are important for forming large organic molecules in the interstellar medium. We present mapping observations of C4H (N = 9−8) lines, c-C3H2 (JKa,Kb = 21,2–10,1), and H13CO+ (J = 1−0) toward 19 nearby cold molecular cores in the Milky Way with the IRAM 30 m telescope. C4H 9–8 was detected in 13 sources, while c-C3H2 was detected in 18 sources. The widely existing C4H and c-C3H2 molecules in cold cores provide material to form large organic molecules. Different spatial distributions between C4H 9–8 and c-C3H2 2–1 were found. The relative abundances of these three molecules were obtained under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions with a fixed excitation temperature. The abundance ratio of C4H to c-C3H2 ranged from 0.34 ± 0.09 in G032.93+02 to 4.65 ± 0.50 in G008.67+22. A weak correlation between C4H/H13CO+ and c-C3H2/H13CO+ abundance ratios was found, with a correlation coefficient of 0.46, which indicates that there is no tight astrochemical connection between C4H and c-C3H2 molecules.

<div> 关键词: SN 2017dio, 爆发物质特性, CSM, 质量损失历史, 化学组成

总结:
SN 2017dio 是一颗具有非典型光曲线和氢丰富CSM特征的Ic-BL超新星。研究发现它的温度自爆炸后20天开始呈线性增加。利用56Ni加上喷射物-CSM相互作用模型拟合其光曲线，发现喷射物、56Ni和CSM的质量分别约为12.41 M⊙、0.17 M⊙和5.82 M⊙。早期光球速度和超新星的动能与SNe Ic-BL和超新星相当。研究推测SN 2017dio的CSM可能来自于超巨星类似的喷发或脉动对不稳定性，或者是超新星爆发前1.2-11.4年的双星质量损失。此外，发现其喷发质量大于许多SNe Ic-BL，但其56Ni质量与文献中SNe Ic-BL的平均值相近，低于超新星的典型HNe（如SN 1998bw和SN 2003dh）。 <div>
We study the energy sources, the physical properties of the ejecta and the circumstellar medium (CSM), and the mass-loss history of the progenitor of SN 2017dio, which is a broad-lined Ic (Ic-BL) supernova (SN) having unusual light curves (LCs) and signatures of hydrogen-rich CSM in its early spectrum. We find that the temperature of SN 2017dio began to increase linearly about 20 days after the explosion. We use the 56Ni plus the ejecta–CSM interaction model to fit the LCs of SN 2017dio, finding that the masses of the ejecta, the 56Ni, and the CSM are ∼12.41 M⊙, ∼0.17 M⊙, and ∼5.82 M⊙, respectively. The early-time photosphere velocity and the kinetic energy of the SN are, respectively, ∼1.89 × 104 km s−1 and ∼2.66 × 1052 erg, which are comparable to those of SNe Ic-BL and hypernovae (HNe), respectively. We suggest that the CSM of SN 2017dio might be from a luminous blue variable–like outburst or pulsational pair instability ∼1.2−11.4 yr prior to the SN explosion or binary mass transfer. Moreover, we find that its ejecta mass is larger than those of many SNe Ic-BL and that its 56Ni mass (MNi) is approximately equal to the mean (or median) value of MNi of SNe Ic-BL in the literature but lower than MNi of prototype HNe (e.g., SN 1998bw and SN 2003dh).

Planetary magnetic fields can affect ionospheric plasma transport and coupling with the solar wind. In contrast to the terrestrial global magnetic field, there are only weaker and sporadic crustal magnetic fields on Mars. Many studies have indicated that Martian crustal fields can still modulate the topside ionosphere and its coupling with the solar wind. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether the crustal fields can affect the ionospheric main peak, which does not directly interact with the solar wind and is dominated by photochemical processes. In this study, the crustal field effect was identified from ionospheric measurements over unevenly distributed crustal fields. Both the intensity and configuration of the crustal fields were found to be capable of affecting the ionospheric main peak. The ionospheric peak electron density tends to decrease in the strong horizontal crustal field region. The results suggest that the crustal fields may affect the ionospheric main peak through modulating solar wind energetic particle precipitation; strong horizontal magnetic fields can partially prevent energetic particle precipitation and thus weaken impact ionization.

总结:<br /><br />这项研究使用VLITE和其他仪器在97个球状星团中搜索脉冲星，发现了一个新的毫秒脉冲星。研究小组发现了10个源，多出了预期的4个。在GLIMPSE-C01星团中发现了一个具有较大脉冲星候选。他们还通过其他波段的观测进一步确认了该候选天体的特性。他们还在该星团中探测到一个自转周期为19.78毫秒的双星脉冲星，并发现其X射线辐射比大多数毫秒脉冲星都强，暗示其磁场较强，表明其再循环过程可能被中断。这项研究表明在高色散方向进行低频率搜索是识别脉冲星候选天体的有效途径。 <div>
We present results from a search for pulsars in globular clusters, including the discovery of a new millisecond pulsar in the stellar cluster GLIMPSE-C01. We searched for low-frequency radio sources within 97 globular clusters using images from the VLA Low-band Ionosphere and Transient Experiment (VLITE) and epochs 1 and 2 of the VLITE Commensal Sky Survey. We discovered 10 sources in our search area, four more than expected from extragalactic source counts at our sensitivity limits. The strongest pulsar candidate was a point source found in GLIMPSE-C01 with a spectral index ∼ − 2.6, and we present additional measurements at 0.675 and 1.25 GHz from the GMRT and 1.52 GHz from the VLA that confirm the spectral index. Using archival Green Bank Telescope S-band data from 2005, we detect a binary pulsar with a spin period of 19.78 ms within the cluster. Although we cannot confirm that this pulsar is at the same position as the steep-spectrum source using the existing data, the pulse flux is consistent with the predicted flux density from other frequencies, making it a probable match. The source also shows strong X-ray emission, indicative of a higher magnetic field than most millisecond pulsars, suggesting that its recycling was interrupted. We demonstrate that low-frequency searches for steep-spectrum sources are an effective way to identify pulsar candidates, in particular on sightlines with high dispersion.

在这项研究中，科学家们通过模拟大规模星团的Monte Carlo模拟，研究了非常巨大恒星的生长过程。他们发现，初始条件对最终非常巨大恒星的质量有很大影响，尤其是初始星团的密度以及恒星初始质量分布。研究结果表明，在较高密度且具有重质量恒星初始质量分布的星团中，很容易形成质量超过1000太阳质量的非常巨大恒星。他们还通过重新计算模型多次得出了非常巨大恒星质量的统计分布。这项研究有助于预测和理解非常巨大恒星的形成和演化过程。<br /><br />总结: <br />非常巨大恒星的质量受星团初始条件影响；初始密度和质量分布决定非常巨大恒星质量；通过统计分布研究非常巨大恒星的质量形成。 <div>
Very massive stars (VMSs) formed via a sequence of stellar collisions in dense star clusters have been proposed as the progenitors of massive black hole seeds. VMSs could indeed collapse to form intermediate-mass black holes, which would then grow by accretion to become the supermassive black holes observed at the centers of galaxies and powering high-redshift quasars. Previous studies have investigated how different cluster initial conditions affect the formation of a VMS, including mass segregation, stellar collisions, and binaries, among others. In this study, we investigate the growth of VMSs with a new grid of Cluster Monte Carlo star cluster simulations—the most expansive to date. The simulations span a wide range of initial conditions, varying the number of stars, cluster density, stellar initial mass function (IMF), and primordial binary fraction. We find a gradual shift in the mass of the most massive collision product across the parameter space; in particular, denser clusters born with top-heavy IMFs provide strong collisional regimes that form VMSs with masses easily exceeding 1000 M⊙. Our results are used to derive a fitting formula that can predict the typical mass of a VMS formed as a function of the star cluster properties. Additionally, we study the stochasticity of this process and derive a statistical distribution for the mass of the VMS formed in one of our models, recomputing the model 50 times with different initial random seeds.

<div> 关键词: 高分辨率模拟, 中性氢云, 星系团, 观测测量, 宇宙学重子流<br />
<br />总结: 本研究使用高分辨率TNG50宇宙学模拟研究了质量类似于Fornax星系团的七个暗物质晕的H i分布。模拟结果表明，在1个暗物质晕半径范围内，Fornax-like TNG50暗物质晕的中性氢云总覆盖面积约为12%（10 kpc像素）和6%（2 kpc像素）。当限制在离星系超过10个半质量半径的气体时，平均值仅略有下降，分别为10%（10 kpc像素）和4%（2 kpc像素）。此外，观测测量显示大量中性氢云分布在星系之外，但似乎与卫星星系相关。该研究为研究冷气体存活的物理过程和宇宙学重子流提供了重要线索。 <div>
The presence of dense, neutral hydrogen clouds in the hot, diffuse intragroup and intracluster (IC) medium is an important clue to the physical processes controlling the survival of cold gas and sheds light on cosmological baryon flows in massive halos. Advances in numerical modeling and observational surveys mean that theory and observational comparisons are now possible. In this paper, we use the high-resolution TNG50 cosmological simulation to study the H i distribution in seven halos with masses similar to the Fornax galaxy cluster. Adopting observational sensitivities similar to the MeerKAT Fornax Survey (MFS), an ongoing H i survey that will probe to column densities of 1018 cm−2, we find that Fornax-like TNG50 halos have an extended distribution of neutral hydrogen clouds. Within 1 Rvir, we predict the MFS will observe a total H i covering fraction of ∼12% (mean value) for 10 kpc pixels and 6% for 2 kpc pixels. If we restrict this to gas more than 10 half-mass radii from galaxies, the mean values only decrease mildly, to 10% (4%) for 10 (2) kpc pixels (albeit with significant halo-to-halo spread). Although there are large amounts of H i outside of galaxies, the gas seems to be associated with satellites, judging both by the visual inspection of projections and by comparison of the line of sight velocities of galaxies and IC H i.

总结:<br /><br />本研究利用深空望远镜中红外仪对HUDF中的28个星系进行了观测，首次在λ > 1 μm的波长下揭示了它们的恒星结构。通过新的深空望远镜光度测量，修正了恒星质量估计，并发现与之前的分析结果有良好的一致性。研究发现，宇宙中午时的大质量、富含气体、正在形成恒星的星系的恒星结构比较平滑，且集中于中心，这对星系形成模拟提出了额外的限制。下一步，匹配分辨率的ALMA观测将对将质量和光线加权的星系结构与尘埃丰富的星际介质进一步联系起来。 <div>
We present deep James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) F560W observations of a flux-limited, Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)-selected sample of 28 galaxies at z = 0.5–3.7 in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF). The data from the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) reveal the stellar structure of the HUDF galaxies at rest-frame wavelengths of λ > 1 μm for the first time. We revise the stellar mass estimates using new JWST photometry and find good agreement with pre-JWST analyses; the few discrepancies can be explained by blending issues in the earlier lower-resolution Spitzer data. At z ∼ 2.5, the resolved rest-frame near-infrared (1.6 μm) structure of the galaxies is significantly more smooth and centrally concentrated than seen by the Hubble Space Telescope at rest-frame 450 nm (F160W), with effective radii of Re(F560W) = 1–5 kpc and Sérsic indices mostly close to an exponential (disk-like) profile (n ≈ 1), up to n ≈ 5 (excluding active galactic nuclei). We find an average size ratio of Re(F560W)/Re(F160W) ≈ 0.7 that decreases with stellar mass. The stellar structure of the ALMA-selected galaxies is indistinguishable from a HUDF reference sample of all galaxies with a MIRI flux density greater than 1 μJy. We supplement our analysis with custom-made, position-dependent, empirical point-spread function models for the F560W observations. The results imply that a smoother stellar structure is in place in massive gas-rich, star-forming galaxies at “Cosmic Noon,” despite a more clumpy rest-frame optical appearance, placing additional constraints on galaxy formation simulations. As a next step, matched-resolution, resolved ALMA observations will be crucial to further link the mass- and light-weighted galaxy structures to the dusty interstellar medium.

<div> GRB, brightness, emission episodes, redshifts, spectral analysis 
总结:
这篇文章研究了两个不寻常的长伽马射线暴（GRB），分别是GRB 211211A和GRB 230307A。研究发现它们具有相似的发射特性，包括零光谱延迟，极短的最小变化时间尺度，以及与热流量和总流量之间的强相关性。还观察到它们的光谱在整个发射过程中都是准热谱，并且光谱宽度比模型预测的黑体辐射要宽。研究者认为这两个GRB可能与紧凑恒星合并有关，并且通过光球辐射解释了它们的辐射机制。 <div>
GRB 211211A is a peculiar long gamma-ray burst (GRB) with very high brightness and short burst properties. Its full light curve consists of three emission episodes, i.e., a precursor, a main burst, and an extended emission. We find that a recently detected long-duration GRB 230307A also includes the three consistent emission episodes. Furthermore, the two bursts have similar redshifts, 0.076 and 0.065, respectively. We perform a detailed temporal and spectral analysis of the two GRBs to compare their temporal and spectral properties. Our analysis shows that the two bursts share great similarities for both the whole emission and the three corresponding emission phases, which are listed as follows: (1) they have near zero spectral lag; (2) they have very short minimum variability timescale (MVT); (3) they lie in the same region of in the MVT–T90, Amati relation and hardness–T90 planes; (4) the three phases are quasi-thermal spectra; (5) both the peak energy and the low-energy index track the flux; (6) the time-resolved spectra are much wider than those of the blackbody predicted by the model; (7) there are strong correlations between thermal flux and total flux and the correlation coefficients, and the slopes for the corresponding stages are very consistent; and (8) the photosphere emission properties are very consistent. Other investigations and observations suggest that the two GRBs indeed belong to a short burst with a compact star merger origin. Therefore, we think that GRB 230307A and GRB 211211A are rare and similar GRBs, and the photospheric radiation can interpret their radiation mechanisms.

总结:
LIGO和Virgo天文探测器使用模板匹配滤波方法主要检测聚合致密双星的引力波信号。然而，非定常噪音干扰以及对黑洞自旋进动和高阶波形谐波的局限性影响了检测灵敏度。研究首次表明，深度学习可用于准确重建具有高阶模式的进动双黑洞信号波形，并可用于快速触发生成算法以增强在线搜索。实验结果显示，该模型对真实LIGO噪音中模拟注入的信号具有高度重叠度，并且在各种黑洞质量和自旋配置下都表现一致。应用于真实引力波事件时，模型的重建结果与非模型和模型分析的重叠度在85%至98%之间，表明深度学习在分析各种致密双星信号方面是一个强大的工具。<br /><br /> <div>
Gravitational-wave signals from coalescing compact binaries in the LIGO and Virgo interferometers are primarily detected by the template-based matched filtering method. While this method is optimal for stationary and Gaussian data scenarios, its sensitivity is often affected by nonstationary noise transients in the detectors. Moreover, most of the current searches do not account for the effects of precession of black hole spins and higher-order waveform harmonics, focusing solely on the leading-order quadrupolar modes. This limitation impacts our search for interesting astrophysical sources, such as intermediate-mass black hole binaries and hierarchical mergers. Here we show, for the first time, that deep learning can be used for accurate waveform reconstruction of precessing binary black hole signals with higher-order modes. This approach can also be adapted into a rapid trigger generation algorithm to enhance online searches. Our model, tested on simulated injections in real LIGO noise from the third observing run (2019–2020) achieved a high degree of overlap with injected signals. This accuracy was consistent across a wide range of black hole masses and spin configurations chosen for this study. When applied to real gravitational-wave events, our model's reconstructions achieved between 85% and 98% overlap with those obtained by Coherent WaveBurst (unmodeled) and LALInference (modeled) analyses. These results suggest that deep learning is a potent tool for analyzing signals from a diverse catalog of compact binaries.

总结:<br />
文章通过研究星系团中的"水母"星系，发现了在其气体触须中形成的新型矮星系。这些触须中的星形成区域质量庞大，且具有金属丰富、年龄较短和典型的矮星系半质量半径等特点。研究还发现这些新型矮星系是由气体触须中诞生的，其本身并不具备暗物质晕。这一发现丰富了我们对星系形成和演化的认识。 <div>
When falling into a galaxy cluster, galaxies experience a loss of gas due to ram pressure stripping. In particular, disk galaxies lose gas from their disks, and very large tentacles of gas can be formed. Because of the morphology of these stripped galaxies, they have been referred to as jellyfish galaxies. It has been found that star formation is triggered not only in the disk, but also in the tentacles of such jellyfish galaxies. The observed star-forming regions located in the tentacles of those galaxies have been found to be as massive as 3 × 107M⊙ and with sizes >100 pc. Interestingly, these parameters in mass and size agree with those of dwarf galaxies. In this work, we make use of the state-of-the-art magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) cosmological simulation IllustrisTNG-50 to study massive jellyfish galaxies with long tentacles. We find that, in the tentacles of TNG-50 jellyfish galaxies, the star formation regions (gas+stars) formed could be as massive as ∼2 × 108M⊙. A particular star-forming region was analyzed. This region has a star formation rate of 0.04 M⊙ yr−1, it is metal-rich, has an average age of 0.46 Gyr, and has a half-mass radius of ∼1 kpc, typical of standard dwarf galaxies. Most importantly, this region is gravitationally self-bound. Overall, we identify a new type of dwarf galaxy being born from the gas tentacles of jellyfish galaxies that, by construction, lacks a dark matter halo.

通过对FRB 20121102A射电暴的观测数据分析，发现了4.605天的周期性和另一个可能的周期性。前者与之前的研究结果一致，而后者是新发现。4.605天的周期性在能量较高的射电暴中表现更为明显。这些（可能的）周期性的存在，以及相应的射电暴在相位空间中的积累，与射电暴可能来自于一个有着紧密伴星行星的双变星系统的理论预测一致。这一发现对确定射电暴的起源具有重要意义。<br /><br />总结: 高能射电暴的观测数据分析发现了4.605天的周期性以及一个新的可能周期性，这与双变星系统理论模型相符，有助于确定射电暴的起源。 <div>
A firm establishment of the presence or the lack of periodicity in repeating fast radio bursts is crucial for determining their origins. Here, we compile 1145 radio bursts of FRB 20121102A with fluence larger than 0.15 Jy ms from observations using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, the Arecibo Observatory, the Green Bank Telescope, the Effelsberg Telescope, the MeerKAT Telescope, the Lovell Telescope, the Deep Space Network 70 m radio telescopes, the Very Large Array, and the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, spanning the time interval of MJD 57175−58776. A quasi-period of days and a candidate quasi-period of days are found through the phase-folding probability binomial analysis. The former is consistent with previous findings and the latter is new. The 4.605 day periodicity is more obvious in high-energy bursts with fluence larger than 1 × 1038 erg. The presence of these (candidate) quasi-periods, together with the corresponding width of burst accumulation in the phase space, are consistent with the bursts originating from a binary degenerate star system with a close-by planet around the primary neutron star.

总结:
本研究通过进行广义相对论的辐射传输计算，展示了包括高度磁化区域在内的相对论性喷流的射电成像。研究发现，对于几乎是垂直观测者来说，230 GHz的光子频率会呈现出多个环状像，这是因为光子在分离表面的弯曲效应非常强烈。此外，在反喷流区域还会出现一个明亮的泪滴状组成部分。在黑洞自旋量级较高时，会呈现出更细小直径的环状特征。这些形态特征不太受广义相对论理想磁流体力学模型参数的影响，因为分离表面的位置主要受到黑洞自旋的调控。我们的广义相对论理想磁流体力学模型和高度磁化喷流漏斗的发射特征可能会在未来的观测中得到检验，例如下一代事件视界望远镜和黑洞探测器。 <div>
By performing general-relativistic radiative transfer calculations, we show the radio images of relativistic jets including highly magnetized regions inside jet funnels, based on steady, axisymmetric, and semianalytic general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics models. It is found that multiple ring images appear at the photon frequency of 230 GHz for nearly pole-on observers, because of the strong light-bending effect on photons generated at the separation surface, which is the boundary between the inflow and outflow flows in the jet funnel. A bright teardrop-shaped component, which extends from the bright rings of the separation surface, also appears in the counterjet region. The diameter of the brightest outermost ring originated from the counterjet is ∼60 μas, which is consistent with the ringlike images of M87 at 86 GHz observed with GMVA, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, and the Greenland Telescope, whose ring diameter is . The thinner and smaller-diameter rings are exhibited when the black hole spin magnitude is higher. These morphological features are expected to appear without being prominently affected by the detailed magnetohydrodynamic plasma parameters of our general-relativistic ideal magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) jet model, since the location of the separation surface is mainly regulated by the black hole spin. Our GRMHD model and the emission features of the images in the horizon-scale, highly magnetized jet funnel may be tested by future observations, e.g., the next-generation Event Horizon Telescope and the Black Hole Explorer.

总结: 这项研究通过哈勃空间望远镜得知NGC 1783星团内年轻恒星的运动学特性，并提出了这些年轻恒星由外部低质量恒星系统吸积所致的观点。 <div>
The presence of young stellar populations in the Large Magellanic Cloud cluster NGC 1783 has caught significant attention, with suggestions ranging from it being a genuine secondary stellar generation to a population of blue straggler stars or simply contamination from background stars. Thanks to multiepoch observations with the Hubble Space Telescope, proper motions for stars within the field of NGC 1783 have been derived, thus allowing accurate cluster membership determination. Here, we report that the younger stars within NGC 1783 indeed belong to the cluster and their spatial distribution is more extended compared to the bulk of the older stellar population, consistent with previous studies. Through N-body simulations, we demonstrate that the observed characteristics of the younger stars cannot be explained solely by blue straggler stars in the context of the isolated dynamical evolution of NGC 1783. Instead, accretion of the external, low-mass stellar system can better account for both the inverse spatial concentration and the radial velocity isotropy of the younger stars. We propose that NGC 1783 may have accreted external stars from low-mass stellar systems, resulting in a mixture of external younger stars and blue straggler stars from the older bulk population, thereby accounting for the characteristics of the younger sequence.

Atmospheric pollutants such as chlorofluorocarbons and NO2 have been proposed as potential remotely detectable atmospheric technosignature gases. Here we investigate the potential for artificial greenhouse gases including CF4, C2F6, C3F8, SF6, and NF3 to generate detectable atmospheric signatures. In contrast to passive incidental by-products of industrial processes, artificial greenhouse gases would represent an intentional effort to change the climate of a planet with long-lived, low-toxicity gases and would possess low false positive potential. An extraterrestrial civilization may be motivated to undertake such an effort to arrest a predicted snowball state on their home world or to terraform an otherwise uninhabitable terrestrial planet within their system. Because artificial greenhouse gases strongly absorb in the thermal mid-infrared window of temperate atmospheres, a terraformed planet will logically possess strong absorption features from these gases at mid-infrared wavelengths (∼8–12 μm), possibly accompanied by diagnostic features in the near-infrared. As a proof of concept, we calculate the needed observation time to detect 1 [10](100) ppm of C2F6/C3F8/SF6 on TRAPPIST-1 f with JWST MIRI’s Low Resolution Spectrometer (LRS) and NIRSpec. We find that a combination of 1[10](100) ppm each of C2F6, C3F8, and SF6 can be detected with a signal-to-noise ratio ≧ 5 in as few as 25[10](5) transits with MIRI/LRS. We further explore mid-infrared direct-imaging scenarios with the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets mission concept and find these gases are more detectable than standard biosignatures at these concentrations. Consequently, artificial greenhouse gases can be readily detected (or excluded) during normal planetary characterization observations with no additional overhead.

总结:<br /><br />本文通过使用3D数据驱动全球磁流体动力学数值模型探讨了动态日冕中形成的磁场反转的演变。研究发现，影响磁场反转寿命的两个因素是角度和长度的组合以及速度剪切。角度和长度的组合确保了重新连接后更大曲率的磁场反转能够持续更长时间，而速度剪切则影响着磁场反转的增强或削弱。这些发现有助于解释磁场反转能够在太阳风和星际空间中持续存在的原因。 <div>
Parker Solar Probe, the closest spacecraft to the Sun, has renewed our understanding of the solar corona and the interplanetary space. One of its important findings is the prevalence of switchbacks, which display localized magnetic reversals along the otherwise Parker spirals. While some switchbacks might disappear quickly, others can maintain for a long period of time, and there are indications that many switchbacks strengthen from the solar corona to the interplanetary space despite their magnetic tension force, which tends to straighten the magnetic field lines. Therefore, how these switchbacks could be maintained for a long period of time remains a mystery. In this paper, we employed a 3D data-driven global full magnetohydrodynamics numerical model to explore the evolution of switchbacks formed in the dynamic corona. Our simulations indicate that two factors can affect the lifetime of a switchback. One factor is the combination of angle and leg length ensures that the switchback with greater curvature after reconnection can last longer, and the greater the angle, the more magnetic field lines that can be reconnected, and thus the longer the duration. We call this influencing factor flux tube shape factor. The other factor is the velocity shear, i.e., when the solar wind at the convex-outward turning of a switchback is faster than that at the concave-outward turning, the switchback becomes enhanced during propagation, and it weakens when the velocity difference is opposite.

总结: 
HADS星是高振幅δ Sct星，它们的脉动行为有助于研究恒星内部。本研究分析了TESS新观测到的七颗振幅超过0.3等的HADS星。结果显示其中三颗是基本径向模式脉动，两颗具有双径向模式，另外两颗呈现三重模式。这七颗星靠近赫罗图中的内不稳定带。它们的基本模式符合δ Sct星的周期-光度关系，但其中一颗略有偏离。另外，双模和三模HADS星的周期比符合预期。利用其他176颗HADS星的数据，发现了金属丰度和质量、光度、有效温度以及基本周期之间的关系。这七颗新发现的HADS星的金属丰度范围在-0.62到0.37 dex之间。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究分析了由TESS新观测到的七颗HADS星的脉动行为，发现它们的基本模式符合δ Sct星的周期-光度关系，另外双模和三模HADS星的周期比也符合预期。同时还探讨了金属丰度和恒星质量、光度、有效温度以及基本周期之间的关系。 <div>
The regular behavior of the pulsations of high-amplitude δ Sct (HADS) stars gives a greater chance to investigate the interiors of stars. We analyzed seven HADS stars showing peak-to-peak amplitudes of more than 0.3 mag that were newly observed by TESS. We obtained that TIC 374753270, TIC 710783, and TIC 187386415 pulsate in fundamental radial mode; also, TIC 130474019 and TIC 160120432 show double radial modes. On the other hand, TIC 148357344 and TIC 278119167 demonstrate triple-mode behavior. Our analysis shows that these seven stars are close to the red edge of the (inside) instability strip in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. The fundamental mode of these seven targets follows the period–luminosity (PL) relation for δ Sct stars. However, TIC 278119167 deviates slightly from the fundamental PL relation. The double-mode and triple-mode HADS stars (TIC 130474019, TIC 160120432, TIC 148357344, and TIC 278119167) are in agreement with the period ratio ranges (fundamental to first and second overtones). Using the information of 176 HADS stars (Netzel and Smolec), we find a scaling relation ( )) between the metallicity ([Fe/H]) and mass (M), luminosity (L), effective temperature (Teff), and the fundamental period (P0). We estimate the metallicity of the seven newly identified HADS stars ranging from −0.62 to 0.37 dex.

<div> 关键词: 二进制演化模型, 大质量主序星, 非守恒质量传递, 成分丰度, 聚类中心

总结:
本研究提出了一套大质量主序星（10≤M1≤40 M⊙）的二进制演化模型，通过非守恒质量传递来跟踪这些系统的喷射物的总质量和化学成分。这些喷射物显示出所需的热氢燃烧丰度特征，能够解释大质量恒星聚类中观察到的多重星族的丰度模式。研究计算了与野外恒星群中分布一致的质量、质量比和周期的一群二进制星的总产出。结果表明，这些物质的总丰度富集了氦、氮、钠和铝，并且缺乏碳、氧和镁，其丰度变化量与观测结果一致。此外，研究还表明，这样一群二进制星将在约12百万年的特征时间尺度内将其约25%的质量排出为这些喷射物（与所有恒星为单星时的4%相比）。作者强调，需要认真考虑大质量二进制星作为解释大质量星团中多重星族所需的富集物来源，因为几乎所有大质量恒星都是在二进制或更高阶多重系统中形成的，大质量二进制星主要是在聚类中形成的，并且大质量二进制星自然产生符合要求的物质。 <div>
We present a suite of binary evolution models with massive primaries (10 ≤ M1 ≤ 40 M⊙) and periods and mass ratios chosen such that the systems undergo nonconservative mass transfer while the primaries have helium cores. We track the total mass and chemical composition of the ejecta from these systems. This material shows the abundance signatures of hot hydrogen burning that are needed to explain the abundance patterns seen in multiple populations in massive star clusters. We then calculate the total yield of a population of binary stars with masses, mass ratios, and periods consistent with their distribution in a field population. We show that the overall abundance of this material is enriched in helium, nitrogen, sodium, and aluminum, and depleted in carbon, oxygen, and magnesium, by amounts that are consistent with observations. We also show that such a population of binaries will return approximately 25% of its mass in this ejecta (compared to 4% if all the stars were single), over a characteristic timescale of about 12 Myr. We argue that massive binaries must be seriously considered as a contributor to the source of enriched material needed to explain the multiple populations in massive clusters, since essentially all massive stars are formed in binaries or higher-order multiples, massive binaries are primarily formed in clusters, and massive binaries naturally produce material of the right composition.

总结: 
Henize 2–10是一个正在经历正反馈黑洞的矮星系，通过对其H2O“kilomaser”的研究，发现了两个不同位置和速度的maser源。第一个maser源与已知的黑洞流出和触发的星形成区域相吻合，这证实了一部分maser是由于黑洞流出冲击沿流动的密集分子气体而产生的。第二个maser源位于东南方，远离中央黑洞，具有狭窄的宽度，这表明它与星形成有关。这项工作揭示了Henize 2–10中H2O kilomaser的性质，并阐明了流出驱动的H2O maser与正反馈黑洞之间的第一个已知联系。<br /><br /> <div>
Henize 2–10 is a dwarf galaxy experiencing positive black hole (BH) feedback from a radio-detected low-luminosity active galactic nucleus. Previous Green Bank Telescope (GBT) observations detected a H2O “kilomaser” in Henize 2–10, but the low angular resolution (33″) left the location and origin of the maser ambiguous. We present new Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations of the H2O maser line at 22.23508 GHz in Henize 2–10 with ∼2″ resolution. These observations reveal two maser sources distinct in position and velocity. The first maser source is spatially coincident with the known BH outflow and the region of triggered star formation ∼70 pc to the east. Combined with the broad width of the maser (W50 ∼ 66 km s−1), this confirms our hypothesis that part of the maser detected with the GBT is produced by the impact of the BH outflow shocking the dense molecular gas along the flow and at the interface of the eastern star-forming region. The second maser source lies to the southeast, far from the central BH, and has a narrow width (W50 ∼ 8 km s−1), suggesting a star formation–related origin. This work has revealed the nature of the H2O kilomaser in Henize 2–10 and illustrates the first known connection between outflow-driven H2O masers and positive BH feedback.

We report the detection of a long X-ray burst from the ultracompact binary 4U 1850–087. The type I X-ray burst was observed on MJD 60171.65 by the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image and Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). We analyze the NICER data between MJD 60095.19 and 60177.43, which includes the observation covering parts of the long X-ray burst decay phase, i.e., 0.15–3.8 hr after the trigger. The persistent spectra are well described by a multicolor disk blackbody, with an inner temperature of ∼0.5 keV, a thermally Comptonized continuum, an asymptotic power-law photon index of Γ ∼ 2.2, and an electron temperature of kTe ∼ 20–30 keV. The mean persistent flux was around 3.8 × 10−10 erg cm−2 s−1, corresponding to a local mass accretion rate of . Part of the time-resolved burst spectra show a clear deviation from the blackbody model, which can be improved by considering the enhanced persistent emission due to the Poynting–Robertson drag or the reflected disk emission illuminated by the burst. From the burst flux during the cooling phase, we estimate the burst duration, τ ≈ 0.78 hr, the burst fluence, Eb ≈ 4.1 × 1041 erg, and the ignition column depth, yign ≈ 3.5 × 1010 g cm−2. These long X-ray burst parameters from 4U 1850–087 suggest a regime of unstable burning of a thick, pure helium layer slowly accreted from a helium donor star. Moreover, we identify 7σ significant ∼1 keV emission lines in the burst spectra, which may originate from the surrounding accretion disk.

<div> Magnetospheric Multiscale, whistler-mode waves, solar wind, terrestrial space, electron temperature anisotropy
总结:
本研究基于Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS)数据，展示了地球白天侧对不同太阳风条件下哨兵模式波的动态响应。统计结果显示，哨兵模式波的发生率、振幅以及相应的电子温度各向异性随着Psw的增加而增加，这归因于磁场在磁层外磁屏和外磁层的压缩。此外，在太阳际磁场向南的情况下，哨兵模式波的发生率比太阳际磁场向北的情况下更高，大多数对应于Te⊥/Te∥ > 1，并且在准径向太阳际磁场下有更高的发生率。这些结果表明，这些磁屏和外磁层中的哨兵模式波像内部磁层一样明显受太阳风的调节。这项工作推动了我们对太阳-地球相互作用的理解。 <div>
Whistler-mode waves have been extensively observed and investigated in terrestrial space. In this study, we present the dynamic response of whistler-mode waves to different solar wind conditions in the dayside terrestrial space based on Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) data. Statistical results show that the occurrence rate, amplitudes, and corresponding electron temperature anisotropy of whistler-mode waves increase with Psw in the dayside terrestrial space, which is attributed to the compression of magnetic fields in these magnetosheath and outer magnetosphere. Furthermore, whistler-mode waves under the southward interplanetary magnetic fields (IMFs) show a higher occurrence rate than that under the northward IMFs, mostly corresponding to Te⊥/Te∥ > 1, and have a higher occurrence rate during quasi-radial IMFs. These results present that whistler-mode waves in these magnetosheath and outer magnetosphere are also modulated by the solar wind as clearly as the inner magnetosphere. This work advanced our understanding in the solar–terrestrial interaction.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了非相对论性准平行无碰撞震荡引起的粒子加速现象，特别是正电子在等离子体中的加速过程。研究发现，在震荡前沿，大量上游粒子被反射并且能量显著增加，这些被反射的粒子可以有效地注入扩散震荡加速过程中。此外，被反射的正电子在沿着磁场上游运动时，可以被磁场引起的电场进一步加速。因此，相比电子，正电子可以被优先加速并注入扩散震荡加速过程中。 <div>
Energetic positrons have been observed in the interstellar medium, and high-energy positrons with relativistic energies up to approximately 1 TeV have been detected in Galactic cosmic rays. We conducted a study on the acceleration of particles, specifically positrons, in a nonrelativistic quasi-parallel collisionless shock induced by a plasma consisting of protons, electrons, and positrons. The positron-to-proton number density ratio in the plasma is 0.1. We focused on a representative shock with a sonic Mach number of 17.1 and an Alfvénic Mach number of 16.8 in the rest frame of the shock. To investigate the acceleration mechanisms of particles including positrons in the shock, we utilized 1D particle-in-cell simulations. It was found that all three species of particles in the shock can be accelerated and exhibit power-law spectra. At the shock front, a significant portion of incoming upstream particles are reflected and undergo significant energy increases, and these reflected particles can be efficiently injected into the process of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). Moveover, the reflected positrons can be further accelerated by an electric field parallel to the magnetic field when they move along the magnetic field upstream of the shock. As a result, positrons can be preferentially accelerated to be injected in the DSA process compared to electrons.

<div> solar radio bursts, coherent emission, Nobeyama Radio Polarimeters, electron cyclotron maser (ECM) emission, gyrosynchrotron flare emission
<br /><br />总结: 本论文研究了太阳射电爆发中相干辐射的发生率，使用了1988年至2023年Nobeyama射电偏振计观测到的3800个太阳射电爆发的修订目录。重点关注1.0和2.0 GHz数据，观察到了达到10^10 Jy数量级的射电流量。之前的研究表明，这些爆发是由电子回旋脉塞（ECM）辐射引起的。根据射电波谱，可以区分1 GHz的相干辐射和传统的不相干回旋辐射。对于超过100 sfu的爆发，发现四分之三的1 GHz爆发和一半的2 GHz爆发具有主导的相干辐射成分，假设为ECM。在1 GHz的大多数非常明亮的爆发中，极化度很高，与相干辐射机制一致，但并非总是100%极化。1至2 GHz的频率范围被广泛用于地球应用，这些结果对理解可能影响这些应用的极端流量水平是相关的，并且为与其他恒星和潜在外行星上的ECM辐射研究进行比较提供了参考。 <div>
This paper investigates the incidence of coherent emission in solar radio bursts, using a revised catalog of 3800 solar radio bursts observed by the Nobeyama Radio Polarimeters from 1988 to 2023. We focus on the 1.0 and 2.0 GHz data, where radio fluxes of order 1010 Jy have been observed. Previous work has suggested that these bursts are due to electron cyclotron maser (ECM) emission. In at least one well-studied case, the bright emission at 1 GHz consists of narrowband spikes of millisecond duration. Coherent emission at 1 GHz can be distinguished from traditional incoherent gyrosynchrotron flare emission based on the radio spectrum: Gyrosynchrotron emission at 1 GHz usually has a spectrum rising with frequency, so bursts in which 1 GHz is stronger than higher-frequency measurements are unlikely to be incoherent gyrosynchrotron. Based on this criterion, it is found that for bursts exceeding 100 sfu, three-quarters of all bursts at 1 GHz and half of all 2 GHz bursts have a dominant coherent emission component, assumed to be ECM. The majority of the very bright bursts at 1 GHz are highly circularly polarized, consistent with a coherent emission mechanism, but not always 100% polarized. The frequency range from 1 to 2 GHz is heavily utilized for terrestrial applications, and these results are relevant for understanding the extreme flux levels that may impact such applications. Further, they provide a reference for comparison with the study of ECM emission from other stars and potentially exoplanets.

LIM是天体物理学中的一种重要探测方法，通过对远距离星系的积分谱线发射进行统计分析。文章介绍了一种新的方法LIM-LLX来量化线-线交叉相关，用于研究目标信号和干扰信号。研究发现，在特定红移下，使用CO(6-5)线与C ii 158进行交叉相关可以得到较高的信噪比，并且较少偏差。通过利用不同的CO跃迁线来探测低红移的宇宙，还展示了交叉相关的广泛能力。最后，将低频通道整合到实验中，可以最大限度地减少仪器噪声和干扰信号引入的偏差。 <div>
Line intensity mapping (LIM) serves as a potent probe in astrophysics, relying on the statistical analysis of integrated spectral line emissions originating from distant star-forming galaxies. While LIM observations hold the promise of achieving a broad spectrum of scientific objectives, a significant hurdle for future experiments lies in distinguishing the targeted spectral line emitted at a specific redshift from undesired line emissions originating at different redshifts. The presence of these interloping lines poses a challenge to the accuracy of cosmological analyses. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to quantify line–line cross-correlations (LIM-LLX), enabling us to investigate the target signal amid instrumental noise and interloping emissions. For example, at a redshift of z ∼ 3.7, we observed that the measured auto-power spectrum of C ii 158 exhibited substantial bias, from interloping line emission. However, cross-correlating C ii 158 with CO(6–5) lines using an FYST-like experiment yielded a promising result, with a signal-to-noise ratio of ∼10. This measurement is notably unbiased. Additionally, we explore the extensive capabilities of cross-correlation by leveraging various CO transitions to probe the tomographic Universe at lower redshifts through LIM-LLX. We further demonstrate that incorporating low-frequency channels, such as 90 and 150 GHz, into FYST’s EoR-Spec-like experiment can maximize the potential for cross-correlation studies, effectively reducing the bias introduced by instrumental noise and interlopers.

总结: 
本研究提出了一个新的热木星大气中云的两维微物理模型，考虑了纵向气体和云的输运效应。通过对平衡温度从1000到2100 K范围内的一系列热木星进行模拟，预测了云粒子大小分布与行星经度和大气高度的关系。结果表明，在二维模型中，某些云物种能够在热木星的白昼侧被输运并存活，这在一维模型中是无法预测的。此外，我们发现凝结性气体物种的耗尽程度随着经度和大气高度的变化而变化，进而影响了气相化学反应。最后，我们讨论了各种模型敏感度，包括云属性对微物理参数的敏感度相对较小，而对大气热结构以及冷凝物质的水平和垂直输运的敏感度更大。 <div>
We present a new two-dimensional, bin-scheme microphysical model of cloud formation in the atmospheres of hot Jupiters that includes the effects of longitudinal gas and cloud transport. We predict cloud particle size distributions as a function of planetary longitude and atmospheric height for a grid of hot Jupiters with equilibrium temperatures ranging from 1000 to 2100 K. The predicted 2D cloud distributions vary significantly from models that do not consider horizontal cloud transport and we discuss the microphysical and transport timescales that give rise to the differences in 2D versus 1D models. We find that the horizontal advection of cloud particles increases the cloud formation efficiency for nearly all cloud species and homogenizes cloud distributions across the planets in our model grid. In 2D models, certain cloud species are able to be transported and survive on the daysides of hot Jupiters in cases where 1D models would not predict the existence of clouds. We demonstrate that the depletion of condensible gas species varies as a function of longitude and atmospheric height across the planet, which impacts the resultant gas-phase chemistry. Finally, we discuss various model sensitivities including the sensitivity of cloud properties to microphysical parameters, which we find to be substantially less than the sensitivity to the atmospheric thermal structure and horizontal and vertical transport of condensible material.

The measurements of morphological indicators of galaxies are often influenced by a series of observational effects. In this study, we utilize a sample of 832 TNG50 simulated galaxies with log(M*/M⊙)> 9 at 0.5 < z < 3 to investigate the differences in nonparametric morphological indicators (C, A, Gini, M20, AO, and DO) derived from noise-free and high-resolution TNG50 images and mock images simulated to have the same observational conditions as JWST/NIRCam. We quantify the relationship between intrinsic and observed values of the morphological indicators and accordingly apply this calibration to 4733 galaxies in the same stellar mass and redshift ranges observed in JWST CEERS and JADES surveys. We find a significant evolution of morphological indicators with rest-frame wavelength (λrf) at λrf < 1 μm, while essentially no obvious variations occur at λrf > 1 μm. The morphological indicators of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and quiescent galaxies (QGs) are significantly different. The morphologies of QGs exhibit a higher sensitivity to rest-frame wavelength than SFGs. After analyzing the evolution of morphological indicators in the rest-frame V band (0.5–0.7 μm) and rest-frame J band (1.1–1.4 μm), we find that the morphologies of QGs evolve substantially with both redshift and stellar mass. For SFGs, the C, Gini, and M20 show a rapid evolution with stellar mass at log(M*/M⊙) ≥ 10.5, while the AO, DO, and A evolve with both redshift and stellar mass. Our comparison shows that TNG50 simulations effectively reproduce the morphological indicators we measured from JWST observations when the impact of dust attenuation is considered.

<div> Hubble eXtreme Deep Field, JWST/MIRI, 强Hα发射体, 宇宙再电离, 离子化光子产生效率
<br /><br />
总结: 本研究利用JWST/MIRI在Hubble eXtreme Deep Field的超深图像，在z≃7-8时限制了强Hα发射体（HAEs）在“宇宙再电离”中的作用。样本包括年轻（<35 Myr）低质量（≲109M⊙）的星系，它们的紫外线连续光谱坡度（β）范围广，与星等质量有关。计算结果表明这些发射体对周围星系间介质进行再电离仅需较小的逸出分数（fesc，rel）为6%至15%。与同一红移范围内的非HAE星系相比，强、年轻、低质量的发射体可能在宇宙再电离中发挥了重要作用。 <div>
By using an ultradeep JWST/MIRI image at 5.6 μm in the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field, we constrain the role of strong Hα emitters (HAEs) during “cosmic reionization” at z ≃ 7–8. Our sample of HAEs is comprised of young (<35 Myr) galaxies, except for one single galaxy (≈300 Myr), with low stellar masses (≲109M⊙). These HAEs show a wide range of rest-frame UV continuum slopes (β), with a median value of β = −2.15 ± 0.21, which broadly correlates with stellar mass. We estimate the ionizing photon production efficiency (ξion,0) of these sources (assuming fesc,LyC = 0%), which yields a median value . We show that ξion,0 positively correlates with Hα equivalent width and specific star formation rate. Instead ξion,0 weakly anticorrelates with stellar mass and β. Based on the β values, we predict , which results in . Considering this and related findings from the literature, we find a mild evolution of ξion with redshift. Additionally, our results suggest that these HAEs require only modest escape fractions (fesc,rel) of 6%–15% to reionize their surrounding intergalactic medium. By only considering the contribution of these HAEs, we estimated their total ionizing emissivity ( ) as . When comparing their with non-HAE galaxies across the same redshift range, we find that that strong, young, and low-mass emitters may have played an important role during cosmic reionization.

<div> 超大质量黑洞，活动星系核，超高红移，BH-星系质量比，BH成长路径
<br />
这项研究使用变化选择的活动星系核样本（iAB ≤ 25.9 and z ≤ 4.5）进行了超大质量黑洞（SMBHs）和宿主星系之间关系的研究。他们基于单次测量维里定律方法估计了黑洞质量（MBH = 10^5.5−10M⊙），并通过谱能分布拟合将总星质量（Mstar = 10^10−12M⊙）与AGN组件分离。研究发现 BH-星系质量比（MBH/Mstar）的红移演化取决于MBH，这是由于MBH与Mstar之间没有明显的相关性。在1.5 < z < 3的低红移变化AGNs中，具有庞大SMBHs（MBH > 10^9M⊙）的对象显示出明显更高的BH-星系质量比（> ∼1%），这意味着庞大SMBHs存在一种典型的成长路径，比目前观察到的局部宇宙中具有相同BH范围的BH-星系球比（MBH/Mbulge）更快。另一方面，在0.5 < z < 3的小质量SMBHs（MBH < 10^8M⊙）中，变化AGNs显示出与局部对象相似的BH-星系质量比（∼0.1%），但比观察到的z > 4时的小些。我们解释说，在中红移时期，宿主星系中的小质量SMBHs已经获得足够的恒星质量，尽管高红移星系相对于中/局部宇宙的星系仍处于星系形成的早期阶段。 
<br /><br />总结: 
超大质量黑洞与宿主星系的关系研究发现，BH-星系质量比的红移演化取决于黑洞质量，大质量SMBHs的成长速度比星系中恒星球成分的形成速度更快，而小质量SMBHs的情况与局部宇宙的类似，但高于高红移时期。这说明在中红移时期，宿主星系中的小质量SMBHs已经获得足够的恒星质量，而高红移星系相对于中/局部宇宙的星系仍处于星系形成的早期阶段。 <div>
We present the study on the relationship between supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies using our variability-selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) sample (iAB ≤ 25.9 and z ≤ 4.5) constructed from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program Ultradeep survey in the COSMOS field. We estimated the black hole (BH) mass (MBH = 105.5−10M⊙) based on the single-epoch virial method and the total stellar mass (Mstar = 1010−12M⊙) by separating the AGN component with spectral energy distribution fitting. We found that the redshift evolution of the BH–stellar mass ratio (MBH/Mstar) depends on the MBH, which is caused by no significant correlation between MBH and Mstar. Variable AGNs with massive SMBHs (MBH > 109M⊙) at 1.5 < z < 3 show considerably higher BH–stellar mass ratios (> ∼1%) than the BH–bulge ratios (MBH/Mbulge) observed in the local Universe for the same BH range. This implies that there is a typical growth path of massive SMBHs, which is faster than the formation of the bulge component as final products seen in the present day. For the low-mass SMBHs (MBH < 108M⊙) at 0.5 < z < 3, on the other hand, variable AGNs show similar BH–stellar mass ratios with the local objects (∼0.1%), but smaller than those observed at z > 4. We interpret that host galaxies harboring less massive SMBHs at intermediate redshift have already acquired sufficient stellar mass, although high-z galaxies are still in the early stage of galaxy formation relative to those at the intermediate/local Universe.

<div> 白矮星，结晶驱动对流，混合长度理论，热扩散，热和成分通量

在这篇论文中，研究人员调查了碳氧白矮星中的结晶驱动对流现象。他们提出了一种混合长度理论的版本，其中自洽地包括了热扩散和成分梯度的影响，并根据局部热量和成分通量提供了对流参数的解决方案。他们的公式能够在低Peclet数时平稳过渡到缓慢的热盐对流状态，在大Peclet数时呈现快速绝热对流状态。该公式还允许热驱动和成分驱动的对流，并能正确考虑在热稳定背景下成分驱动对流的热传输方向。他们使用MESA恒星演化代码计算了不同模型的冷却白矮星在结晶过程中的成分和热通量，并确定了对流状态和对流速度。他们发现，在恒星冷却历史的大部分时间里，对流发生在缓慢的热盐对流状态下。然而，在结晶开始时，成分通量足够大，能够在短时间内驱动快速翻转对流（约10百万年）。他们估计了这两个阶段的对流速度，并讨论了用结晶驱动的涡流解释观测到的白矮星磁场的影响。<br /><br />总结: 白矮星中的结晶驱动对流现象得到了研究。研究人员提出了一种混合长度理论，并使用MESA代码进行了模拟计算。他们发现，在白矮星的冷却历史中，对流主要发生在缓慢的热盐对流状态下，但在结晶开始阶段会出现快速翻转对流。对此，他们估算了对流速度，并探讨了结晶驱动的涡流对观测到的白矮星磁场的影响。 <div>
We investigate crystallization-driven convection in carbon–oxygen white dwarfs. We present a version of the mixing length theory that self-consistently includes the effects of thermal diffusion and composition gradients, and provides solutions for the convective parameters based on the local heat and composition fluxes. Our formulation smoothly transitions between the regimes of fast adiabatic convection at large Peclet number and slow thermohaline convection at low Peclet number. It also allows for both thermally driven and compositionally driven convection, including correctly accounting for the direction of heat transport for compositionally driven convection in a thermally stable background. We use the MESA stellar evolution code to calculate the composition and heat fluxes during crystallization in different models of cooling white dwarfs, and determine the regime of convection and the convective velocity. We find that convection occurs in the regime of slow thermohaline convection during most of the cooling history of the star. However, at the onset of crystallization, the composition flux is large enough to drive fast overturning convection for a short time (∼10 Myr). We estimate the convective velocities in both of these phases and discuss the implications for explaining observed white dwarf magnetic fields with crystallization-driven dynamos.

<div> 关键词: 脉冲星, 源, 伽马射线, X射线, 扩展辐射<br />
总结: <br />
本文介绍了脉冲星周围扩展的伽马射线源，即TeV halo的发现和特性。研究指出，这些源的伽马射线是由脉冲星风星云的逃逸电子/正电子与背景辐射场发生逆康普顿散射产生的。目前存在三种不同的粒子输运机制模型，分别是各向同性的、抑制扩散模型；各向同性的、不受抑制扩散模型以及各向异性扩散模型。这三种模型对宇宙射线输运机制和星际磁场的性质有着不同的影响。研究还计算了这些模型下脉冲星halo的X射线发射，发现这些逃逸电子/正电子的同步辐射可以产生相应的X射线halo，并且在三种模型下预期的表面亮度轮廓有所不同。由此可见，敏感的X射线探测器对于理解脉冲星halo的形成机制至关重要，也可以作为星际湍流性质的探测器。 <div>
Pulsar halos (also termed “TeV halos”) are a new class of γ-ray sources in the Galaxy, which manifest as extended γ-ray emission around middle-aged pulsars, as discovered around the Geminga pulsar, the Monogem pulsar, and PSR J0622+3749 by the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory and the Large High-Altitude Air Shower Observatory. A consensus has been reached that the teraelectronvolt emission comes from the inverse Compton scattering of escaping electrons/positrons from the pulsar wind nebula of the soft background radiation field, while the particle transport mechanism in the halo is still in dispute. Currently, there are mainly three interpretations: the isotropic, suppressed diffusion model; the isotropic, unsuppressed diffusion model that considers the ballistic propagation of newly injected particles; and the anisotropic diffusion model. While the predicted γ-ray surface brightness profiles of all three models can be more or less consistent with the observations, the implications of the three models for cosmic-ray transport mechanisms and the properties of the interstellar magnetic field are quite different. In this study, we calculate the anticipated X-ray emission of pulsar halos under the three models. We show that the synchrotron radiation of these escaping electrons/positrons can produce a corresponding X-ray halo around the pulsar and that the expected surface brightness profiles are distinct in the three models. We suggest that sensitive X-ray detectors of a large field of view (such as eROSITA and the Einstein Probe) with a reasonably long exposure time are crucial to understanding the formation mechanism of pulsar halos and can serve as a probe of the properties of interstellar turbulence.

<div> 关键词: WRLOF, 星际二进制, MESA, 观测数据, 质量转移
总结:
WRLOF是一种质量转移机制，通过在MESA中进行参数研究，发现在大多数模型中，接受者被加速到临界旋转速率。然后假设恒星发展了增强的风，以有效减少角动量，从而保持亚临界旋转。质量转移效率明显低于忽略接受者旋转的先前研究。研究结果与M67中蓝色窥视者的观测资料相比，表明WRLOF机制能够定性解释它们快速旋转的起源、在H-R图上的位置以及它们的轨道周期。 <br /><br /> <div>
Wind Roche-lobe overflow (WRLOF) is a mass-transfer mechanism proposed by Mohamed and Podsiadlowski for stellar binaries wherein the wind acceleration zone of the donor star exceeds its Roche-lobe radius, allowing stellar wind material to be transferred to the accretor at enhanced rates. WRLOF may explain characteristics observed in blue lurkers and blue stragglers. While WRLOF has been implemented in rapid population synthesis codes, it has yet to be explored thoroughly in detailed binary models such as MESA (a 1D stellar evolution code), and over a wide range of initial binary configurations. We incorporate WRLOF accretion in MESA to investigate wide low-mass binaries at solar metallicity. We perform a parameter study over the initial orbital periods and stellar masses. In most of the models where we consider angular momentum transfer during accretion, the accretor is spun up to the critical (or breakup) rotation rate. Then we assume the star develops a boosted wind to efficiently reduce the angular momentum so that it could maintain subcritical rotation. Balanced by boosted wind loss, the accretor only gains ∼2% of its total mass, but can maintain a near-critical rotation rate during WRLOF. Notably, the mass-transfer efficiency is significantly smaller than in previous studies in which the rotation of the accretor is ignored. We compare our results to observational data of blue lurkers in M67 and find that the WRLOF mechanism can qualitatively explain the origin of their rapid rotation, their location on the H-R diagram, and their orbital periods.

We explore the evolution of massive stars (>8 M⊙) with 1D models and present analytical fits to the masses and binding energies of the convective portions of their envelopes. These fits are given as functions of total mass, metallicity, and surface temperature (used as a proxy for evolutionary phase). They enable the application of the two-stage common envelope (CE) formalism in rapid binary population synthesis frameworks. We estimate that the degree of orbital hardening following CE ejection spans 6 orders of magnitude and is a very strong function of the accretor mass, and, to a lesser extent, donor evolutionary phase.

Hydrogen chloride (HCl) is a key repository of chlorine in the interstellar medium. Accurate determinations of its abundance are critical to assessing the chlorine elemental abundance and constraining stellar nucleosynthesis models. To aid in modeling recent and future observations of HCl rovibrational spectra, we present cross sections and rate coefficients for collisions between HCl and molecular hydrogen. Transitions between rovibrational states of HCl are considered for temperatures ranging from 10 to 3000 K. Cross sections are computed using a full dimensional quantum close-coupling (CC) method and a reduced dimensionality coupled-states (CS) approach. The CS results, benchmarked against the CC results, are used with a recoupling approach to calculate hyperfine-resolved rate coefficients for rovibrational transitions of HCl induced by H2. The rate coefficients will allow for a better determination of the HCl abundance in the interstellar medium and an improved understanding of interstellar chlorine chemistry. We demonstrate the utility of the new rate coefficients in a nonthermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer model applied to observations of HCl rovibrational transitions in a circumstellar shell.

The Cygnus region, which contains massive molecular and atomic clouds and young stars, is a promising Galactic neutrino source candidate. Cosmic-ray transport in the region can produce neutrinos and γ-rays. Recently, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) detected an ultrahigh-energy γ-ray bubble (Cygnus Bubble) in this region. Using publicly available track events detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory in 7 yr of full detector operation, we conduct searches for correlated neutrino signals from the Cygnus Bubble with neutrino emission templates based on LHAASO γ-ray observations. No significant signals were found for any employed templates. With the 7 TeV γ-ray flux template, we set a flux upper limit of 90% confidence level for the neutrino emission from the Cygnus Bubble to be 5.7 × 10−13 TeV−1 cm−2 s−1 at 5 TeV.

总结:
在这篇文章中，研究人员报告了他们在深度JWST NIRCam成像中偶然发现的低质量星系Ark 227（M* = 5 × 109M⊙；d = 35 Mpc）周围的星际晕。通过组合大半径处的解析恒星与NIRCam和Dragonfly成像处的弥散辐射，研究人员能够跟踪该星系的表面亮度和颜色分布，并观察到超过预测暗物质晕的整个范围，从0.1到100 kpc。他们观察到在10-20 kpc处有一个特征，模拟显示这可能是由质量比为1:10的次要合并引起的。金属丰度在这个径向范围内下降，进一步支持了次要合并的情况。此外，在50到100 kpc处还有第二个出现迹象，伴随着金属丰度的下降。最外层包层中的恒星质量约为107M⊙。这些结果表明Ark 227经历了多次与低质量星系的合并，与冷暗物质主导宇宙结构的分级生长的情况大致一致。最后，他们还发现了一个与Ark 227相关的超微暗星系，证明JWST能够探测到至少距离约30 Mpc的极低质量矮星系。<br /><br />总结: 这篇文章报道了利用JWST NIRCam成像发现的低质量星系Ark 227周围的星际晕，以及这些观察结果对暗物质和星系合并的重要意义。 <div>
We report the serendipitous discovery of an extended stellar halo surrounding the low-mass galaxy Ark 227 (M* = 5 × 109M⊙; d = 35 Mpc) in deep JWST NIRCam imaging from the Blue Jay Survey. The F200W–F444W color provides robust star–galaxy separation, enabling the identification of stars at very low density. By combining resolved stars at large galactocentric distances with diffuse emission from NIRCam and Dragonfly imaging at smaller distances, we trace the surface-brightness and color profiles of this galaxy over the entire extent of its predicted dark matter halo, from 0.1 to 100 kpc. Controlled N-body simulations have predicted that minor mergers create “accretion shelves” in the surface-brightness profile at large radius. We observe such a feature in Ark 227 at 10–20 kpc, which, according to models, could be caused by a merger with total mass ratio 1:10. The metallicity declines over this radial range, further supporting the minor merger scenario. There is tentative evidence of a second shelf at μV ≈ 35 mag arcsec−2 extending from 50 to 100 kpc, along with a corresponding drop in metallicity. The stellar mass in this outermost envelope is ≈107M⊙. These results suggest that Ark 227 experienced multiple mergers with a spectrum of lower-mass galaxies—a scenario that is broadly consistent with the hierarchical growth of structure in a cold-dark-matter-dominated universe. Finally, we identify an ultra-faint dwarf associated with Ark 227 with M* ≈ 105M⊙ and μV,e = 28.1 mag arcsec−2, demonstrating that JWST is capable of detecting very-low-mass dwarfs to distances of at least ∼30 Mpc.

Our understanding of early-type galaxies (ETGs) has grown in the past decade with the advance of full-spectrum fitting techniques used to infer the properties of the stellar populations that make up the galaxy. We present ages, central velocity dispersions, and abundance ratios relative to Fe of C, N, O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Sr, Ba, and Eu, derived using full-spectrum fitting techniques for three ETGs, NGC 2865, NGC 3818, and NGC 4915. Each of these three galaxies were selected because they have optical, disturbed structures (fine structure) that are linked to major merger events that occurred 1, 7, and 6 Gyr ago, respectively. Two of the ETGs, NGC 3818 and NGC 4915, show chemical signatures similar to ETGs without fine structure, which is consistent with a gas-poor merger of elliptical galaxies in which substantial star formation is not expected. For NGC 2865, we find a statistically higher abundance of Ca (an α element) and Cr and Mn (Fe-peak elements). We show that for NGC 2865, a simple gas-rich merger scenario fails to explain the larger abundance ratios compared to ETGs without fine structure. These three ETGs with fine structure exhibit a range of abundances, suggesting ETGs with fine structure can form via multiple pathways and types of galaxy mergers.

We report Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array/Atacama Compact Array observations of a high-density region of the Corona Australis cloud forming a young star cluster, and the results of resolving internal structures. In addition to embedded Class 0/I protostars in the continuum, a number of complex dense filamentary structures are detected in the C18O and SO lines by the 7 m array. These are substructures of the molecular clump that are detected by the total power array as extended emission. We identify 101 and 37 filamentary structures with widths of a few thousand astronomical units in C18O and SO, respectively, which are called feathers. The typical column density of the feathers in C18O is about 1022 cm−2, and the volume density and line mass are ∼105 cm−3 and a few M☉ pc−1, respectively. This line mass is significantly smaller than the critical line mass expected for cold and dense gas. These structures have complex velocity fields, indicating a turbulent interior. The number of feathers associated with Class 0/I protostars is only ∼10, indicating that most of them do not form stars but rather are transient structures. The formation of feathers can be interpreted as a result of colliding gas flow because the morphology is well reproduced by MHD simulations, and this is supported by the presence of H i shells in the vicinity. The colliding gas flows may accumulate gas and form filaments and feathers, and trigger the active star formation of the R CrA cluster.

这篇文章介绍了利用分光偏振技术研究活动星系核（AGNs）中心区域的方法和结果。研究发现，通过偏振测量可以探索磁场结构、演变和喷流中的粒子加速物理。对PKS 0637–75和PKS 1510–089进行了分光偏振研究，发现了连续光偏振的变化，其中PKS 0637–75的平均水平为2.5%，PKS 1510–089的平均水平为7.5%。在广谱线和连续谱中观察到了偏振变化，但广谱线的偏振水平较低。研究结果还确认了光谱能量分布模拟的结论，即PKS 0637–75的光偏振主要受吸积盘辐射影响，而PKS 1510–089的光偏振既受吸积盘辐射影响，又受喷流辐射影响，在瞬变状态下喷流贡献更大。
<br /><br />总结: <br />分光偏振技术用于研究AGNs中心区域；PKS 0637–75和PKS 1510–089的光偏振显示出连续光偏振变化；广谱线的光偏振较低，但结果证实了光谱能量分布模拟的结论。 <div>
Spectropolarimetry is a powerful tool to investigate the central regions of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) as polarization signatures are key to probing magnetic field structure, evolution, and the physics of particle acceleration in jets. Optical linear polarization of blazars is typically greater than a few percent, indicating the emission is dominated by nonthermal synchrotron radiation, while polarization less than a few percent is common for other type 1 AGNs. We present a spectropolarimetric study of PKS 0637–75 and PKS 1510–089 to determine how the head-on orientation of a jet and dominant emission processes influence polarimetric variations in the broad lines and continuum. Observations were obtained biweekly from the Robert Stobie Spectrograph on the Southern African Large Telescope. Variability in the continuum polarization is detected for both PKS 0637–75 and PKS 1510–089, with a total average level of 2.5% ± 0.1% and 7.5% ± 0.1%, respectively. There is no clear polarization in the broad Balmer emission lines and weak polarization in Mg ii as the average level across all observations is 0.2% ± 0.1% for Hβ, 0.2% ± 0.3% for Hγ, and 0.6% ± 0.2% for Mg ii. We find that polarization measurements confirm the conclusions drawn from spectral energy distribution modeling of the disk–jet contributions to the emission as optical polarization and time variability for PKS 0637–75 are shown to be dominated by accretion disk emission while those of PKS 1510–089 are due to both disk and jet emission, with greater jet contribution during flaring states.

在这项研究中，使用谐波密度泛函理论计算，系统研究了具有边缘缺陷的多环芳烃（PAHs）的光谱特性。通过与JWST早期释放科学PDRs4All计划的Orion Bar的NIRSpec和MIRI-MRS光谱进行直接比较，评估了它们在天文学上的相关性。研究发现，具有边缘缺陷的PAHs能够很好地再现天文学上的6.2μm PAH发射带，包括其蓝色边，计算中考虑了偏振效应，而无需含氮的PAHs。具有边缘缺陷的小型中性PAHs解释了3.3μm带的蓝翼。在再现8.6和11.2μm带轮廓时需要较少数量的边缘缺陷，而11.0 + 11.2/12.7μm带强度比是边缘缺陷数量的一种衡量。对Orion Bar光谱的盲数据库拟合将6-15μm区域的误差控制在9.9％，并清晰地显示了电荷的轮廓，其中6-10μm PAH带由PAH阳离子携带，而10-15μm区域主要由中性PAHs携带。阴离子的贡献可以忽略不计。扶手椅状PAHs适合12.7μm带，同时产生了一个非常微弱的以3.225μm为中心的宽发射特征。锯齿状PAHs适合11.2μm带。研究得出结论，具有较少边缘缺陷的PAHs，以及扶手椅状和锯齿状PAHs，都对观测到的星际红外发射有贡献。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究通过密度泛函理论计算和天文观测数据对多环芳烃（PAHs）的光谱特性进行了系统研究，并发现具有边缘缺陷的PAHs能够很好地再现天文学上观测到的发射光谱特征。另外，研究还发现PAHs的电荷分布与红外发射波段有明显的相关性，且不同形式的PAHs对不同的红外波段有不同的贡献。 <div>
A systematic study was performed on the spectral properties of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with edge defects using harmonic density functional theory calculations. Their potential astronomical relevance was assessed through direct comparison with NIRSpec and MIRI-MRS spectra of the atomic photodissociation region of the Orion Bar from the JWST Early Release Science PDRs4All program. It is found that the astronomical 6.2 μm PAH emission band, including its blue side, is well reproduced by PAHs with edge defects, when taking into account the effects of polarization in the computations, and without a need for PAHs that contain nitrogen. Small neutral PAHs with edge defects explain the blue wing of the 3.3 μm band. A low number of edge defects is required to reproduce the 8.6 and 11.2 μm band profiles, while the 11.0 + 11.2/12.7 μm band intensity ratio is a measure for the number of edge defects. A blind database fit to the Orion Bar spectrum reproduces the 6–15 μm region with an error of 9.9% and shows a clear delineation of charge, with the 6–10 μm PAH bands being carried by PAH cations and the 10–15 μm region by predominantly neutral PAHs. The contribution of anions is negligible. Armchair PAHs fit the 12.7 μm band, simultaneously producing a very weak broad emission feature centered at 3.225 μm. Zigzag PAHs fit the 11.2 μm band. It is concluded that PAHs with a low number of edge defects, in addition to armchair and zigzag PAHs, all contribute to the observed interstellar infrared emission.

We present an atmospheric retrieval analysis of Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3/G141 spectroscopic phase curve observations of two brown dwarfs, WD-0137B and EPIC-2122B, in ultrashort period orbits around white dwarf hosts. These systems are analogous to hot and ultra-hot Jupiter systems, enabling a unique and high-precision comparison to exoplanet systems. We use the PHOENIX Exoplanet Retrieval Algorithm retrieval suite to test various analysis setups, including joint-phase retrievals, multiple temperature structures, and nonuniform abundances. We find that WD-0137B has a dayside that closely resembles that of other ultra-hot Jupiters with inverted temperature structures and H− opacity, but quickly transitions to a mostly noninverted temperature structure on the nightside. Meanwhile, EPIC-2122B’s atmosphere remains inverted at all constrained longitudes, with dominant H− opacity. Retrievals with multiple temperature profiles and nonuniform vertical abundances were generally not statistically justified for this data set, but retrievals with dayside-dilution factors were found to be justified. Retrieving all phases simultaneously with a linear combination of a dayside and nightside atmosphere was found to be an adequate representation of the entire phase curve once a longitudinal temperature gradient free parameter was included in the retrieval. Comparing to global circulation models, we attribute behavior in the 1D retrievals to the inclined viewing geometry of the systems, which results in always-visible irradiated and inverted portions of the atmosphere contaminating spectra measured from the nightside hemisphere. This study sheds light on the similarities between these irradiated brown dwarf systems and hot and ultra-hot Jupiters, but also their unique differences, including the influence of the inclined viewing geometry.

<br /><br />总结: 本研究利用大约9000个核方程态，通过线性广义相对论形式主义研究了中子星内部的准正常f-模振荡。我们发现f-模频率与核饱和性质之间存在一定的关联，但需要更复杂的方法来揭示多参数关系。在PSR J0740+6620和PSR J0030+0451观测数据上，我们发现NICER数据与部分和最小重叠的核子-夸克混合方程态模型的半径和频率值相吻合，这表明需要考虑超饱和密度下的异质子。未来观测可以进一步验证核子-夸克混合方程态或提供对其的明确证据。 <div>
We study quasi-normal f-mode oscillations in neutron star (NS) interiors within a linearized general relativistic formalism. We utilize approximately 9000 nuclear equations of state (EOSs) using spectral representation techniques, incorporating constraints on nuclear saturation properties, chiral effective field theory for pure neutron matter, and perturbative quantum chromodynamics for densities pertinent to NS cores. The median values of the f-mode frequency, νf (damping time, τf) for NSs with masses ranging from 1.4 to 2.0 M⊙ lie between 1.80 and 2.20 kHz (0.13–0.22 s) for our entire EOS set. Our study reveals a weak correlation between f-mode frequencies and individual nuclear saturation properties, prompting the necessity for more intricate methodologies to unveil multiparameter relationships. We observe a robust linear relationship between the radii and f-mode frequencies for different NS masses. Leveraging this correlation alongside NICER observations of PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0030+0451, we establish constraints that exhibit partial and minimal overlap for observational data from Riley et al. and Miller et al., respectively, with our nucleonic EOS data set. Moreover, NICER data align closely with the radius and frequency values for a few hadron–quark hybrid EOS models. This indicates the need to consider additional exotic particles such as deconfined quarks at suprasaturation densities. We conclude that future observations of the radius or f-mode frequency for more than one NS mass, particularly at the extremes of the viable NS mass scale, would either rule out nucleon-only EOSs or provide definitive evidence in its favor.

Large-scale coronal plasma evolutions can be adequately described by magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. However, full multidimensional MHD simulations require substantial computational resources. Given the low plasma β in the solar corona, in many coronal studies, it suffices to approximate the magnetic field to remain topologically fixed and effectively conduct one-dimensional (1D) hydrodynamic (HD) simulations instead. This approach is often employed in studies of coronal loops and their liability to form condensations related to thermal instability. While 1D HD simulations along given and fixed field line shapes are convenient and fast, they are difficult to directly compare with multidimensional phenomena. Therefore, it is more convenient to solve volume-filling, multidimensional versions of the MHD equations where we freeze the magnetic field, transforming it into frozen-field HD (ffHD) equations for simulation. We have incorporated this ffHD module into our open-source MPI-AMRVAC code and tested it using a two-dimensional (2D) evaporation–condensation model to study prominence formation due to radiative losses. The 2D ffHD results are compared with those from actual 2D MHD and pseudo-2D HD simulations, analyzing the differences and their causes. Pseudo-2D studies account for the known flux tube expansion effects. Overall, the performance of 2D ffHD is close to that of 2D MHD and pseudo-2D HD. The 2D tests conducted in this paper will be extended in follow-up studies to 3D simulations based on analytical or observational approaches.

Recent astrophysical models predict that stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) could form and coalesce within a few gravitational radii of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Detecting the gravitational waves (GWs) from such systems requires numerical tools that can track the dynamics of the binaries while capturing all the essential relativistic effects. This work develops upon our earlier study of a BBH moving along a circular orbit in the equatorial plane of a Kerr SMBH. Here we modify the numerical method to simulate a BBH falling toward the SMBH along a parabolic orbit of arbitrary inclination with respect to the equator. By tracking the evolution in a frame freely falling alongside the binary, we find that the eccentricity of the BBH is more easily excited than it is in the previous equatorial case, and that the cause is the asymmetry of the tidal tensor imposed on the binary when the binary moves out of the equatorial plane. Since the eccentricity reaches maximum around the same time as the BBH becomes the closest to the SMBH, multiband GW bursts could be produced that are simultaneously detectable by space- and ground-based detectors. We show that the effective spin parameters of such GW events also undergo significant variation due to the rapid reorientation of the inner BBHs during their interaction with SMBHs. These results demonstrate the richness of three-body dynamics in the region of strong gravity, and highlight the necessity of building new numerical tools to simulate such systems.

这篇文章讨论了在明亮状态与暗淡状态之间发生转变的活动星系核（AGN）中观察到的强软X射线辐射。研究通过三维辐射磁流体模拟成功地复现了黑洞周围的热辐射低效涡流外的温暖、汤姆逊光厚区域。研究表明，这一区域是由于反康普顿散射导致的有效辐射冷却形成的，并且得出与CLAGN的亮度一致的计算亮度0.01-0.08个Eddington亮度。同时还发现，这个温暖的康普顿化区域很好地符合由方位磁场支撑的磁化盘的稳态模型。当支撑辐射冷却区域的反平行方位磁场在盘的赤道平面周围重新连接时，该区域的温度会因释放到该区域的磁能而升高。 <div>
Strong soft X-ray emission called soft X-ray excess is often observed in luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN). It has been suggested that the soft X-rays are emitted from a warm (T = 106 ∼ 107 K) region that is optically thick for the Thomson scattering (warm Comptonization region). Motivated by the recent observations that soft X-ray excess appears in changing look AGN (CLAGN) during the state transition from a dim state without broad emission lines to a bright state with broad emission lines, we performed global three-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations, assuming that the mass accretion rate increases and becomes around 10% of the Eddington accretion rate. The simulation successfully reproduces a warm, Thomson-thick region outside the hot radiatively inefficient accretion flow near the black hole. The warm region is formed by efficient radiative cooling due to inverse Compton scattering. The calculated luminosity 0.01−0.08 LEdd is consistent with the luminosity of CLAGN. We also found that the warm Comptonization region is well described by the steady model of magnetized disks supported by azimuthal magnetic fields. When the antiparallel azimuthal magnetic fields supporting the radiatively cooled region reconnect around the equatorial plane of the disk, the temperature of the region becomes higher by releasing the magnetic energy transported to the region.

总结: 本研究利用暗能量光谱仪（DESI）对α精细结构常数的时空变化施加了强约束。利用约110,000个具有强且窄的[O iii] λλ4959, 5007发射线的星系进行测量，发现红移变化水平为(2–3) × 10^(-5)的α变化，但这很有可能是由于波长标定的系统误差引起的。通过改进波长标定和增加星系样本，预期能够获得更好的约束。未发现明显的大尺度结构中的α空间变化。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
We present strong constraints on the spacetime variation of the fine-structure constant α using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). In this pilot work, we utilize ∼110,000 galaxies with strong and narrow [O iii] λλ4959, 5007 emission lines to measure the relative variation Δα/α in space and time. The [O iii] doublet is arguably the best choice for this purpose owing to its wide wavelength separation between the two lines and its strong emission in many galaxies. Our galaxy sample spans a redshift range of 0 < z < 0.95, covering half of all cosmic time. We divide the sample into subsamples in 10 redshift bins (Δz = 0.1), and calculate Δα/α for the individual subsamples. The uncertainties of the measured Δα/α are roughly between 2 × 10−6 and 2 × 10−5. We find an apparent α variation with redshift at a level of Δα/α = (2–3) × 10−5. This is highly likely to be caused by systematics associated with wavelength calibration, since such small systematics can be caused by a wavelength distortion of 0.002–0.003 Å, which is beyond the accuracy that the current DESI data can achieve. We refine the wavelength calibration using sky lines for a small fraction of the galaxies, but this does not change our main results. We further probe the spatial variation of α in small redshift ranges, and do not find obvious, large-scale structures in the spatial distribution of Δα/α. As DESI is ongoing, we will include more galaxies, and by improving the wavelength calibration, we expect to obtain a better constraint that is comparable to the strongest current constraint.

<div> PSR B2110+27, FAST, 脉冲周期，subpulse drift, nulling事件<br />
<br />总结:<br />研究使用FAST对PSR B2110+27的单脉冲发射进行了仔细的观测，发现了显著的subpulse drift和nulling现象。nulling事件持续时间短，整体nulling比例约为27% ± 3%。另外，subpulses的漂移方向存在突然变化，偶尔转化为稳定状态或显示低漂移率。经纬度解析波动谱分析显示，脉冲星存在两个不同的重复周期P3 = (10.8 ± 2.5)P 和 P3 = (31.6 ± 4.2)P。subpulse分离在不同漂移模式下保持一致，P2 = 2.°3 ± 0.°2。更全面的分析表明，这种独特的漂移行为可以用偶极场的旋转模型来解释。在null状态中观察到漂移带记忆和明显的相位记忆，尽管还未检测到nulling本身的显著周期性，这表明这些现象可能源于频繁出现的别名漂移带与随机的null脉冲相交。 <div>
Careful scrutiny of the single pulse emissions from PSR B2110+27 has been conducted through highly sensitive observations using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) at a central frequency of 1250 MHz. Our investigation revealed significant subpulse drift behavior and nulling in this pulsar. Moreover, we observed that the nulling events tend to be of short duration, with an estimated overall nulling fraction of approximately 27% ± 3%. It is noteworthy that the drift direction of the subpulses exhibits abrupt changes, occasionally transitioning into a steady state or displaying a low drift rate. Analysis using longitude resolved fluctuation spectra indicates the presence of two distinct repetition periods for the pulsar: P3 = (10.8 ± 2.5)P and P3 = (31.6 ± 4.2)P, where P denotes the pulsar period. Our investigation revealed that the subpulse separation remains consistent across different drift patterns, with P2 = 2.°3 ± 0.°2. A more comprehensive analysis indicates that the unique drift behavior observed can be explained by a carousel model of the dipole field. Minor changes in P2 and drift rate caused significant variations in the apparent P3 and abrupt shifts in the drift direction, while the true repetition period (assuming first-order aliasing) changed by only ∼10%. We observe a drift band memory and apparent phase memory across the null state in this pulsar, as well as variations in the drift rate and drift direction across the null state, though we have not detected significant periodicity of the nulling itself. This suggests that these phenomena may arise from random null pulses intersecting with the frequently aliased drift bands.

We study the environment of the z = 6.33 ultraluminous quasar SDSS J010013.02+280225.8 (J0100) to understand its association with large-scale structure. Theoretical models propose high-redshift quasars as markers of galaxy overdensities residing in the most massive dark matter halos (DMHs) in the early Universe. J0100 is an ultraluminous quasar with the most massive black hole known at z ≳ 6, suggesting a high likelihood of residing in a massive DMH. We present wide-field (∼522 arcmin2) imaging in the r, i, and z bands from the Large Binocular Cameras on the Large Binocular Telescope, with Y- and J-band imaging from the Wide-field Infrared Camera on the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope, centered on J0100. Applying color selections, we identify 23 objects as i-dropout Lyman break galaxy (LBG) candidates in the J0100 field. We use the deep photometric catalog in the 1.27 deg2 COSMOS field to calculate the density of LBGs in a blank field, and to estimate the selection completeness and purity. The observed surface density of LBG candidates in the J0100 field corresponds to a galaxy overdensity of δ = 4 (at 8.4σ). This large-scale overdensity suggests that the ∼22 arcmin2 overdensity found by Kashino et al. using JWST data extends out to much larger scales. We calculate the angular autocorrelation function of the candidates and find a positive correlation on ≲10′ scales as well as evidence of asymmetries in their spatial distribution, further suggesting the direct detection of large-scale structure in the field of the ultraluminous quasar J0100.

We search for possible pulsar TeV halos among the very-high-energy (VHE) sources reported in different VHE surveys, among which in particular we use the results from the first Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory catalog of γ-ray sources. Six candidates are found. They share similar properties of containing a middle-aged, γ-ray–bright pulsar in their positional error circles (the respective pulsars are J0248+6021, J0359+5414, J0622+3749, J0633+0632, J2006+3102, and J2238+5903), being in a rather clean field without any common Galactic VHE-emitting supernova remnants or (bright) pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe), and showing an absence of any γ-ray emissions in 0.1–500 GeV after removing the pulsars’ emissions. Combining these candidates with several reported (candidate) TeV halos, we obtain relationships between their luminosity at 50 TeV (L50TeV) and the corresponding pulsars’ spin-down energy ( ), which are and , respectively. The relationships are nearly identical to previously reported ones. We probe possible connections between the extent/sizes of the VHE sources and the pulsars’ ages, and find a weak older-and-smaller trend. By comparing to the VHE detection results for PWNe, it is clear that the (candidate) TeV halos have hard emissions by either having power-law indices smaller than 2 in 1–25 TeV or by only being detected in 25–100 TeV. In addition, we also consider seven other VHE sources as possible TeV halos based on the results from different studies of them, but they do not fit cleanly with the properties listed above, indicating their potentially complex nature.

总结: 本研究通过CosmoRun套件模拟了一个银河系质量星系的演化至红移z = 2以下的过程，并与同样的八个暗物质模拟进行了比较。研究了星系在z = 4和3时的一般性质以及最后一次主要并合之前的演化过程，重点关注了旋转支持的盘的形成、质量-金属丰度关系、特定星形成速率、气体的金属丰度梯度以及恒星盘中的非轴对称结构。研究发现，大多数模拟代码在低红移时期都发展出了旋转支持的结构，大多数模拟结果在高和中红移都与观测结果符合较好，并且复现了来自解析模型和低红移观测得到的气体金属丰度梯度。研究还发现模拟代码之间的差异主要是由于控制重力求解器时间步进策略的代码相关参数的变化导致的，早期恒星反馈的变化也会导致低红移并合的时间差异。所有至z = 2的模拟数据和辅助数据将被公开发布。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究通过模拟了一个银河系质量星系的演化至红移z = 2以下的过程，并与同样的八个暗物质模拟进行了比较。研究了星系在z = 4和3时的一般性质以及最后一次主要并合之前的演化过程，重点关注了旋转支持的盘的形成、质量-金属丰度关系、特定星形成速率、气体的金属丰度梯度以及恒星盘中的非轴对称结构。研究发现，大多数模拟代码在低红移时期都发展出了旋转支持的结构，大多数模拟结果在高和中红移都与观测结果符合较好，并且复现了来自解析模型和低红移观测得到的气体金属丰度梯度。 <div>
In this fourth paper from the AGORA Collaboration, we study the evolution down to redshift z = 2 and below of a set of cosmological zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way mass galaxy by eight of the leading hydrodynamic simulation codes. We also compare this CosmoRun suite of simulations with dark matter-only simulations by the same eight codes. We analyze general properties of the halo and galaxy at z = 4 and 3, and before the last major merger, focusing on the formation of well-defined rotationally supported disks, the mass–metallicity relation, the specific star formation rate, the gas metallicity gradients, and the nonaxisymmetric structures in the stellar disks. Codes generally converge well to the stellar-to-halo mass ratios predicted by semianalytic models at z ∼ 2. We see that almost all the hydro codes develop rotationally supported structures at low redshifts. Most agree within 0.5 dex with the observed mass–metallicity relation at high and intermediate redshifts, and reproduce the gas metallicity gradients obtained from analytical models and low-redshift observations. We confirm that the intercode differences in the halo assembly history reported in the first paper of the collaboration also exist in CosmoRun, making the code-to-code comparison more difficult. We show that such differences are mainly due to variations in code-dependent parameters that control the time stepping strategy of the gravity solver. We find that variations in the early stellar feedback can also result in differences in the timing of the low-redshift mergers. All the simulation data down to z = 2 and the auxiliary data will be made publicly available.

总结:
在这项研究中，我们使用了基于高斯和伽马函数混合的模型来拟合具有不同组成部分的SFH。我们的主要目标是利用这个模型来揭示SFH的形状及相应的物理驱动因素。具体来说，我们将这个模型应用于TNG100-1模拟中的星系星形成历史。我们的研究得出了以下发现。首先，我们的模型很好地拟合了TNG星系星形成历史，特别是对于高质量和红色星系；其次，拟合组件的数量和形状与星系的质量和颜色之间存在明显的关系，尤其是中心/孤立星系和卫星星系之间的差异明显；最后，我们的模型使我们能够轻松提取星形成历史中的不同星形成时期并分析每个星形成时期的持续时间和时机。我们的发现表明，每个星形成时期的时机与星系质量和颜色之间存在着密切的关系。 <div>
The star formation history (SFH) is a key issue in the evolution of galaxies. In this work, we developed a model based on a Gaussian and gamma function mixture to fit SFHs with varying numbers of components. Our primary objective was to use this model to reveal the shape of SFHs and the corresponding physical driving factors. Specifically, we applied this model to fit SFHs from the TNG100-1 simulation. Our study led to the following findings. (1) Our model fits with TNG star formation histories well, especially for high-mass and red galaxies; (2) a clear relationship exists between the number and shape of fitted components and the mass and color of galaxies, with notable differences observed between central/isolated and satellite galaxies. (3) Our model allows us to extract different episodes of star formation within star formation histories with ease and analyze the duration and timing of each star formation episode. Our findings indicate a strong relationship between the timing of each star formation episode and galaxy mass and color.

总结:
太阳风暴常常引发不同形态的日冕物质抛射，包括喷射状、气泡状和双重日冕物质抛射。本研究利用太阳动力学观测卫星和太阳地球关系观测卫星的高时空分辨率立体观测数据，在2010年10月至2012年12月期间对太阳喷射相关的日冕物质抛射进行了统计研究。结果显示，日冕物质抛射的形态可能与丝状结构的长度和磁重连相关，而且大多发生在扇-脊磁场拓扑结构中。这一研究为解析日冕物质抛射形态与太阳活动物理机制之间的关联提供了重要线索。<br /><br /> <div>
A solar jet can often cause coronal mass ejections (CMEs) with different morphologies in the high corona, for example, jet-like CMEs, bubble-like CMEs, and so-called twin CMEs that include a pair of simultaneous jet-like and bubble-like CMEs. However, what determines the morphology of a jet-related CME is still an open question. Using high spatiotemporal resolution stereoscopic observations taken by the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory from 2010 October to 2012 December, we performed a statistical study of jet-related CMEs to study the potential physical factors that determine the morphology of CMEs in the outer corona. Our statistical sample includes 16 jet-related CME events of which seven are twin CME events and nine are jet-like narrow CMEs. We find that all CMEs in our sample were accompanied by filament-driven blowout jets and Type III radio bursts during their initial formation and involved magnetic reconnection between filament channels and the surrounding magnetic fields. Most of our cases occurred in a fan-spine magnetic configuration. Our study suggests that the bubble-like components of twin CMEs lacking an obvious core are related to the expansion of the closed-loop systems next to the fan-spine topology, while the jet-like component is from the coronal extension of the jet plasma along open fields. Based on the statistical results, we conclude that the morphology of jet-related CMEs in the high corona may be related to the filament length and the initial magnetic null point height of the fan-spine structures.

总结: 
本研究旨在解析无线电安静活动星系核（RQ AGNs）发射的无线电波的起源，发现其中一种潜在来源是AGN盘风与星际介质（ISM）的冲击相互作用。研究中构建了一个球形、一区域和自相似扩展模型，用于模拟紫外快流（UFOs）与ISM之间的冲击结构。通过解决输运方程，考虑扩散冲击加速作为加速机制和同步辐射以及反Compton冷却作为冷却机制，计算了非热电子的能量密度分布。根据所得的非热电子能量分布，建立了冲击ISM的无线电同步辐射光谱模型。通过X射线观测和测量的UFO速度，研究了15个附近的RQ AGNs的观测无线电光谱所需的冲击ISM参数。其中11个RQ AGNs的无线电光谱可以通过AGN盘风模型解释，这是冲击相互作用可能是它们无线电发射源的有力指示。预测的典型源尺寸和磁场强度分别为几百pc和0.1 mG。此外，还讨论了我们的预测是否可以通过未来的无线电观测来验证。 <br /> <br />总结: <div>
Unraveling the origins of radio emissions from radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (RQ AGNs) remains a pivotal challenge in astrophysics. One potential source of this radiation is the shock interaction between AGN disk winds and the interstellar medium (ISM). To understand this phenomenon, we construct a spherical, one-zone, and self-similar expansion model of shock structure between ultrafast outflows (UFOs) and the ISM. We then calculate the energy density distribution of nonthermal electrons by solving the transport equation, considering diffusive shock acceleration as the acceleration mechanism and synchrotron and inverse Compton cooling as the cooling mechanisms. Based on the derived energy distribution of nonthermal electrons, we model the radio synchrotron spectrum of the shocked ISM. For the 15 nearby RQ AGNs hosting UFOs, we investigate the shocked ISM parameters required to model their observed radio spectra based on X-ray observations and measured UFO velocities. Radio spectra of 11 out of 15 nearby RQ AGNs would be explained by the AGN disk wind model. This is a compelling indication that shock interactions between AGN disk winds and the ISM could indeed be the source of their radio emissions. The typical predicted source size and magnetic field strength are several 100 pc and 0.1 mG, respectively. We also discuss whether our prediction can be tested by future radio observations.

<div> 关键词: 太阳磁场, 表面通量运输模型, STEREO观测, 远侧活动区域, 磁场数据合成

总结:
太阳表面磁场的观测通常局限于地球和太阳之间的直线。作者使用STEREO观测的He ii 304 Å强度图像推断远侧活动区域的出现时间、位置和总未签名磁通量，并开发了自动检测算法将这些数据合并到AFT模型中。该研究发现，在不包含远侧数据的SFT模型中，Solar Cycle 24的最大期间缺少了4-6 × 1022 Mx的磁通量。He ii 304 Å数据可以改进表面通量模型，但需要注意减少耀斑事件引起的强度激增。研究还发现，仅使用He ii 304 Å数据无法完整呈现完整的磁场图像，需要直接的磁场观测数据。 <div>
Observations of the Sun’s photospheric magnetic field are often confined to the Sun–Earth line. Surface flux transport (SFT) models, such as the Advective Flux Transport (AFT) model, simulate the evolution of the photospheric magnetic field to produce magnetic maps over the entire surface of the Sun. While these models are able to evolve active regions that transit the near side of the Sun, new far-side side flux emergence is typically neglected. We demonstrate a new method for creating improved maps of the magnetic field over the Sun’s entire photosphere using data obtained by the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) mission. STEREO He ii 304 Å intensity images are used to infer the time, location, and total unsigned magnetic flux of far-side active regions. We have developed an automatic detection algorithm for finding and ingesting new far-side active region emergence into the AFT model. We conduct a series of simulations to investigate the impact of including active region emergence in AFT, both with and without data assimilation of magnetograms. We find that while He ii 304 Å can be used to improve surface flux models, care must taken to mitigate intensity surges from flaring events. We estimate that during Solar Cycle 24's maximum (2011–2015), 4–6 × 1022 Mx of flux is missing from SFT models that do not include far-side data. We find that while He ii 304 Å data alone can be used to create synchronic maps of photospheric magnetic field that resemble the observations, it is insufficient to produce a complete picture without direct magnetic observations from magnetographs.

<div> cosmological simulations, interstellar dust, reionization era, observational constraints, stellar feedback
总结：<br /><br />这篇文章使用宇宙学仿真模拟了再电离时代星系内的星际尘埃含量，并进行了观测数据的比较。研究发现，在模型参数方面存在无法同时满足观测约束的问题。具体来说，预测在z=5时含有较大星尘质量D/Z≳0.1的模型，由于假设了较高的产生产额和/或星际介质中的高效增长，与总星尘质量和红外光度的约束相符，但这些模型导致了紫外光的过度衰减，无法匹配βUV的观测。为了调查这一差异，研究分析了通过红外和紫外辐射探测的星星和尘埃的相对空间分布，发现与现有数据相比存在过度对称的形态，这很可能是由于模拟中使用的恒星反馈模型的局限性所致。因此，研究结果表明高红移星系中尘埃分布的可观测特性是检验恒星反馈的一个特别严格的测试。 <div>
We model the interstellar dust content of the reionization era with a suite of cosmological, fluid-dynamical simulations of galaxies with stellar masses ranging from ∼105 to 109M⊙ in the first 1.2 Gyr of the Universe. We use a post-processing method that accounts for dust creation and destruction processes, allowing us to systematically vary the parameters of these processes to test whether dust-dependent observable quantities of galaxies at these epochs could be useful for placing constraints on dust physics. We then forward model observable properties of these galaxies to compare to existing data. We find that we are unable to simultaneously match existing observational constraints with any one set of model parameters. Specifically, the models that predict the largest dust masses D/Z ≳ 0.1 at z = 5—because of high assumed production yields and/or efficient growth via accretion in the interstellar medium—are preferred by constraints on total dust mass and infrared (IR) luminosities, but these models produce far too much attenuation in the ultraviolet (UV), preventing them from matching observations of βUV. To investigate this discrepancy, we analyze the relative spatial distribution of stars and dust as probed by IR and UV emission, which appear to exhibit overly symmetric morphologies compared to existing data, likely due to the limitations of the stellar feedback model used in the simulations. Our results indicate that the observable properties of the dust distribution in high redshift galaxies are a particularly strong test of stellar feedback.

Observational evidence is accumulating that turbulence in the solar wind is intermittent (non-Gaussian) because of the strong presence of a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D), low-frequency turbulence component containing nonpropagating, closed, small-scale magnetic flux ropes with open meandering field lines in between. le Roux & Zank showed how one can derive fractional focused and Parker-type transport equations that model large-scale anomalous transport in the solar wind as the outcome of energetic particle interaction with quasi-2D turbulence. In this follow-up paper this theory is developed further to address certain limitations. (i) The second moment of the Lévy probability distribution function (PDF) specified in the theory for the particle step size is infinite, indicating unphysical transport. (ii) The expected transition of energetic particle transport from anomalous to normal diffusion beyond a certain critical transport distance was not included. (iii) The competition between anomalous diffusion and advection is not properly sustained at late times. Shortcomings (i) and (ii) are addressed by introducing an exponentially truncated Lévy PDF for the energetic particle step size in the theory, resulting in revised tempered fractional focused and Parker-type transport equations featuring tempered fractional derivatives that enable modeling of tempered Lévy flights. Furthermore, these equations are cast in a tempered fractional telegrapher form to investigate whether the fractional wave equation part of the equation can restore causality in unscattered particle transport during early times and in Lévy flights during intermediate times (Lévy walks). They are also transformed into a tempered fractional Fokker–Planck form to overcome limitation (iii).

We observed the nearby and relatively understudied ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) NGC 4190 ULX-1 jointly with Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) and NuSTAR to investigate its broadband spectrum, timing properties, and spectral variation over time. We found NGC 4190 ULX-1 to have a hard spectrum characterized by two thermal components (with temperatures ∼0.25 and ∼1.6 keV) and a high-energy excess typical of the ULX population although the spectrum turns over at an unusually low energy. While no pulsations were detected (with pulsed fraction 3σ upper limits of 16% for NICER and 35% for NuSTAR), the source shows significant stochastic variability, and the covariance spectrum indicates the presence of a high-energy cutoff power-law component, potentially indicative of an accretion column. Additionally, when fitting archival XMM-Newton data with a similar model, we find that the luminosity–temperature evolution of the hot thermal component follows the behavior of a super-Eddington slim disk though the expected spectral broadening for such a disk is not seen, suggesting that the inner accretion disk may be truncated by a magnetic field. Therefore, despite the lack of detected pulsations, there is tantalizing evidence for NGC 4190 ULX-1 being a candidate neutron star accretor although further broadband observations will be required to confirm this behavior.

Radio observations of pulsars offer a potential method to probe the intricate microstructure in the turbulent interstellar medium. Here we report on a high-resolution dynamic spectral analysis of the “swooshing pulsar” B0919+06 observed with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope over multiple epochs and with the ultrawideband receiver on the Parkes radio telescope. For all observations, the dynamic scintillation spectra, two-dimensional autocovariance functions, and secondary spectra are presented. At 1250 MHz, the decorrelation bandwidth, diffraction timescale, and the drift rate are determined to be Δνd = 25.89 ± 7.55 MHz, minutes, and MHz−1, respectively. The frequency dependencies of the scintillation parameters exhibit single power-law spectral behaviors, indicating that the electron density fluctuations in the interstellar medium approximately follow the Kolmogorov spectrum. The secondary spectra exhibit two distinct parabolic arcs with well-determined curvatures of 0.002 and 0.02 s3 for the outer and inner arcs, respectively. The locations of the scattering screens are approximately determined to be 157.3 and 726.0 pc, respectively, from the pulsar for isotropic scattering. The inner scintillation arc is present contemporaneously over a wide frequency range, indicating that the scintillation arc is a broadband phenomenon. The arc curvature scales with observing frequency as a power law with an index of −2.05 ± 0.05, which implies that the scattering screen spans a physical distance from 689.7 to 883.3 pc from the pulsar.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了外行星系统的星系形成模型，发现热木星的宿主恒星显示出与非宿主恒星不同的相空间特征，这可能是因为它们形成于星际密度较高的恒星形成区域，经历了动力学的干扰。通过模拟实验发现，保留其行星的恒星相空间较高，这是因为它们经历的干扰较少。而行星轨道被显著改变的宿主恒星也主要分布在高相空间区域。这证实了其他研究的结论，即热木星宿主恒星的高相空间特征不是由动力学干扰或恒星团聚引起的，而是反映了这些恒星（动力学上）比其他外行星宿主恒星更年轻。 <div>
The architectures of extrasolar planetary systems often deviate considerably from the “standard” model for planet formation, which is largely based on our own solar system. In particular, gas giants on close orbits are not predicted by planet formation theory and so some processes are thought to move the planets closer to their host stars. Recent research has suggested that hot-Jupiter host stars display a different phase space compared to stars that do not host hot Jupiters. This has been attributed to these stars forming in star-forming regions of high stellar density, where dynamical interactions with passing stars have perturbed the planets. We test this hypothesis by quantifying the phase space of planet-hosting stars in dynamical N-body simulations of star-forming regions. We find that stars that retain their planets have a higher phase space than nonhosts, regardless of their initial physical density. This is because an imprint of the kinematic substructure from the regions birth is retained, as these stars have experienced fewer and less disruptive encounters than stars whose planets have been liberated and become free-floating. However, host stars whose planets remain bound but have had their orbits significantly altered by dynamical encounters are also primarily found in high phase space regimes. We therefore corroborate other research in this area that has suggested the high phase space of hot-Jupiter host stars is not caused by dynamical encounters or stellar clustering, but rather reflects an age bias in that these stars are (kinematically) younger than other exoplanet host stars.

Fermi泡沫，辐射频谱，电子加速，星际辐射，模型
<br /><br />总结:
Fermi泡沫的全频谱显示出与边缘强冲击电子加速和环境星际辐射密切相关的特征。辐射频谱中的冷却断裂对应着微波范围的不同。发现泡沫边缘存在下游的尘埃成分，掩盖了预期的大约35 GHz频谱断裂点。模型显示泡沫几百万年的年龄，边缘附近的辐射场和磁化程度均相对均匀。 <div>
The full, radio to γ-ray spectrum of the Fermi bubbles is shown to be consistent with standard strong-shock electron acceleration at the bubble edge, without the unnatural energy cutoffs and unrealistic electron cooling of previous studies, if the ambient interstellar radiation is strong; the γ-ray cooling break should then have a microwave counterpart, undetected until now. Indeed, a broadband bubble-edge analysis uncovers a pronounced downstream dust component, which masked the anticipated ∼35 GHz spectral break, and the same overall radio softening consistent with Kraichnan diffusion previously reported in γ-rays. A self-consistent bulk and edge model implies a few Myr old bubbles, with fairly uniform radiation fields and enhanced magnetization near the edge.

<div> 关键词: 脉冲星，初始自旋周期分布，贝叶斯方法，选择效应，ATNF脉冲星目录

这项研究通过研究与超新星遗迹相关的年轻脉冲星的群体来推导中子星的初始自旋周期分布。他们使用层次贝叶斯方法考虑了个体观测的测量不确定性和选择效应。在不进行选择效应修正的情况下，他们发现脉冲星的初始自旋周期遵循威布尔分布，在40毫秒处达到高峰，比起对数正态分布，贝叶斯因子为200。他们定量研究了射电脉冲星调查中已知的选择效应，包括脉冲展宽和周期相关的束缚比例。他们表明，基于ATNF脉冲星目录中的脉冲星亮度和自旋周期测量，脉冲展宽对推断脉冲星周期分布的影响可能微乎其微。在修正束缚选择效应后，威布尔分布仍然是首选模型，但其高峰略微偏向更长的周期，达到50毫秒。他们的方法将在约方公里阵列时代约束中子星的诞生特性方面发挥作用。

总结: 该研究使用贝叶斯方法研究了年轻脉冲星的初始自旋周期分布，发现脉冲星的初始自旋周期遵循威布尔分布，尖峰在40毫秒处。他们还定量研究了射电脉冲星调查中的选择效应，指出脉冲展宽对脉冲星周期分布的影响微乎其微。修正束缚选择效应后，威布尔分布仍然是首选模型，但其高峰略微偏向更长的周期，达到50毫秒。该方法对约方公里阵列时代约束中子星的诞生特性非常有用。 <div>
We derive the initial spin period distribution of neutron stars by studying the population of young pulsars associated with supernova remnants. Our hierarchical Bayesian approach accounts for the measurement uncertainties of individual observations and selection effects. Without correcting for selection effects, as done in previous studies, we find that pulsar initial spin periods follow a Weibull distribution, peaking at 40 ms, which is favored against a lognormal distribution with a Bayes factor of 200. The known selection effects in radio pulsar surveys, including pulse broadening and period-dependent beaming fraction, have been quantitatively investigated. We show that, based on measurements of pulsar luminosity and spin period from the ATNF Pulsar Catalogue, the impact of pulse broadening on the inference of the pulsar period distribution is likely to be insignificant. Correcting for the beaming selection effect, the Weibull distribution remains the preferred model, while its peak slightly shifts to longer periods at 50 ms. Our method will prove useful in constraining the birth properties of neutron stars in the Square Kilometre Array era.

<div> NS-NS binary merger, supramassive NS, accretion disk, EOS constraints, collapse time distribution
总结：<br /><br />本文研究了NS-NS双星合并形成紧凑遗留物的过程，发现受NS初始表面磁场影响较小。考虑了吸积盘效应后，发现SMNS形成的崩塌时间分布基本不变，但磁偶极辐射总能量取决于初始磁场强度。通过对SMNS比例的约束，排除了一些EOS，并得到了三种候选EOS。在观测数据比较后发现，仅有ENG EOS符合观测结果。最后通过基于ENG EOS和银河系统的质量分布得出，大约99%的NS-NS合并会在10^7s内坍缩成黑洞。这包括立刻形成黑洞（36.5%），形成SMNS（60.7%），或者经过吸积后转变成黑洞或SMNS（2.1%）。并且指出了GW170817和GW190425的遗物更有可能是黑洞。 <div>
The merger of a neutron star (NS)–NS binary can form different productions of compact remnants, among which a supramassive NS (SMNS) can create an internal plateau, and the following steep decay marks the collapse of the SMNS. The proportion of the SMNS and the corresponding collapse time are often used to constrain the NS equation of state (EOS). This paper revisits this topic by considering the effect of an accretion disk on a compact remnant, which is not considered in previous works. Compared with previous works, the collapse-time distribution (peaks ∼100 s) of SMNSs formed from an NS–NS merger is almost unaffected by the initial surface magnetic field (Bs,i) of the NS, but the total energy output of the magnetic dipole radiation from the SMNSs depends on Bs,i significantly. Coupling the constraints from the SMNS fraction, we exclude some EOSs and obtain three candidate EOSs, i.e., DD2, ENG, and MPA1. By comparing the distributions of the collapse time and the luminosity of the internal plateau (in the short gamma-ray bursts) for observations obtained based on the three candidate EOSs, it is shown that only the EOS of ENG is favored. Our sample, based on the ENG EOS and a mass distribution motivated by Galactic systems, suggests that approximately 99% of NS–NS mergers collapse to form a black hole (BH) within 107s. This includes scenarios promptly forming a BH (36.5%), an SMNS (60.7%), or a stable NS that transitions into a BH or an SMNS following accretion (2.1%). It also indicates that the remnants for GW170817 and GW190425, and the second object of GW190814, are more likely to be BHs.

总结:<br />
文章介绍了使用Markov Chain Monte Carlo方法基于Gaia DR3数据对大麦哲伦星云(LMC)盘进行了动力学建模。研究发现星团和年轻恒星具有明显不同的动力学中心，盘倾斜角，节点线位置角和尺度半径。同时还观察到盘参数有显著的径向变化，并发现可能与长条和螺旋臂的扰动有关。动力学异常的星团指示了LMC盘中的时空扰动，与预期的LMC与小麦哲伦星云最近碰撞的影响因素和时间相匹配。 <div>
The internal kinematics of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) disk have been modeled by several studies using different tracers with varying coverage, resulting in a range of parameters. Here, we model the LMC disk using 1705 star clusters and field stars, based on a robust Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, using Gaia DR3 data. The dependency of the model parameters on the age, coverage, and strength of the clusters are also presented. This is the first comprehensive 2D kinematic study using star clusters. Red clump (RC) stars and young main-sequence stars are also modeled for comparison. The clusters and field stars are found to have distinctly different kinematic centers, disk inclination, position angle of the line of nodes, and scale radius. We also note a significant radial variation of the disk parameters. Clusters and young stars are found to have a large residual proper motion and a relatively large velocity dispersion when compared to the RC field population, which could be due to perturbation from the bar and spiral arms. We trace the presence of the large residual proper motion and noncircular motion among clusters likely to be due to the bar and detect a decrease in the scale radius as a result of the possible evolution of the bar. The kinematically deviant clusters point to a spatiotemporal disturbance in the LMC disk, matching with the expected impact factor and time of the recent collision between the LMC and the Small Magellanic Cloud.

<div> 黑洞，GRMHD模拟，立体磁流体动力学，冲击波，电子加热
总结:
GRMHD模拟显示黑洞倾斜盘中存在冲击波。我们通过2D粒子在电离细胞模拟研究了这些冲击波的效率和机制，发现后冲击波电子温度几乎不受等离子体beta值和前冲击波电子与离子温度比的影响。我们发现在Ms约为5-6时，电子的非绝热加热受到磁泵驱动的影响。我们的结果为黑洞吸积流中的无碰撞冲击波提供了物理合理的子网预设，可以用于电子加热。 <div>
General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of black hole tilted disks—where the angular momentum of the accretion flow at large distances is misaligned with respect to the black hole spin—commonly display standing shocks within a few to tens of gravitational radii from the black hole. In GRMHD simulations of geometrically thick, optically thin accretion flows, applicable to low-luminosity sources like Sgr A* and M87*, the shocks have transrelativistic speed, moderate plasma beta (the ratio of ion thermal pressure to magnetic pressure is βpi1 ∼ 1–8), and low sonic Mach number (the ratio of shock speed to sound speed is Ms ∼ 1–6). We study such shocks with 2D particle-in-cell simulations, and we quantify the efficiency and mechanisms of electron heating for the special case of preshock magnetic fields perpendicular to the shock direction of propagation. We find that the postshock electron temperature Te2 exceeds the adiabatic expectation Te2,ad by an amount , nearly independent of the plasma beta and of the preshock electron-to-ion temperature ratio Te1/Ti1, which we vary from 0.1 to unity. We investigate the heating physics for Ms ∼ 5–6 and find that electron superadiabatic heating is governed by magnetic pumping at Te1/Ti1 = 1, whereas heating by B-parallel electric fields (i.e., parallel to the local magnetic field) dominates at Te1/Ti1 = 0.1. Our results provide physically motivated subgrid prescriptions for electron heating at the collisionless shocks seen in GRMHD simulations of black hole accretion flows.

<div> 关键词: 磁场, 年轻原恒星, 偏振观测, 稳定性, 辐射

总结:
磁场在年轻原恒星的形成中起着重要作用，通过多尺度和多波长的尘埃偏振观测可以揭示从云到核到原恒星的推断磁场。本文利用SOFIA上的HAWC+对IRAS 16293-2422年轻原恒星三重系统进行了连续偏振观测，结果表明平均磁场角度为89°±23°，与在更大尺度（≳2000 au）上观测到的∼170°磁场形态不同。这种对齐差异表明较短波长的HAWC+数据在追踪来自喷流腔的暖尘的磁场，而较长波长的数据在追踪来自较冷尘的均匀磁场。此外，我们还在这个源中发现，观测波长对尘埃辐射峰值有很大影响，尘埃辐射峰值随着波长的增加从B源（北方源）逐渐变向A源（南方源）。 <div>
Magnetic fields likely play an important role in the formation of young protostars. Multiscale and multiwavelength dust polarization observations can reveal the inferred magnetic field from scales of the cloud to core to protostar. We present continuum polarization observations of the young protostellar triple system IRAS 16293-2422 at 89 μm using HAWC+ on SOFIA. The inferred magnetic field is very uniform with an average field angle of 89° ± 23° (E of N), which is different from the ∼170° field morphology seen at 850 μm at larger scales (≳2000 au) with JCMT POL-2 and at 1.3 mm on smaller scales (≲300 au) with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The HAWC+ magnetic field direction is aligned with the known E-W outflow. This alignment difference suggests that the shorter wavelength HAWC+ data is tracing the magnetic field associated with warmer dust likely from the outflow cavity, whereas the longer wavelength data are tracing the bulk magnetic field from cooler dust. Also, we show in this source the dust emission peak is strongly affected by the observing wavelength. The dust continuum peaks closer to source B (northern source) at shorter wavelengths and progressively moves toward the southern A source with increasing wavelength (from 22 to 850 μm).

总结:
本文使用不稳定性分析推导了存在CRs时的激波宽度。我们得出了一个将激波宽度与CR指数以及上游粒子加速的分数联系起来的解析表达式。我们发现当这个分数超过30%时，一种新的不稳定性变得主导。激波经历了一个转变，其宽度增加了大约8-10倍，CR加速效果结束了。我们的分析适用于强非相对论和非磁化激波。我们讨论了这些结果对观察到的CR光谱和通量的预期范围以及非相对论碰撞激波的结构的影响。 <div>
Despite being studied for many years, the structure of collisionless shocks is still not fully determined. Such shocks are known to be accelerators of cosmic rays (CRs), which, in turn, modify the shock structure. The shock width λ is known to be connected to the CR spectral index a. Here, we use an instability analysis to derive the shock width in the presence of CRs. We obtain an analytical expression connecting the shock width to the CR index and to the fraction of upstream particles that are accelerated. We find that when this fraction becomes larger than ∼30%, a new instability becomes dominant. The shock undergoes a transition where its width increases by a factor ∼8–10, and the CR acceleration effectively ends. Our analysis is valid for strong, nonrelativistic, and unmagnetized shocks. We discuss the implication of these results on the expected range of CR spectra and flux observed and on the structure of nonrelativistic collisionless shocks.

<div> 黑洞候选天体 Swift J1727.8–1613 的QPO的研究揭示了其频率与能量之间的关联，以及其与频率的变化的性质。观测发现在3赫兹以下，频率与能量的关系较小，而在3赫兹以上则显示出明显的变化。此外，在频率超过8赫兹后，变化速率急剧下降，这与以前报道的现象类似，暗示了一个共同的物理机制。此外，QPO的rms频率关系可以用Lense-Thirring进动模型解释。同时，能量与相位滞后之间的关系也表明了黑洞系统的高倾角性质。

<br /><br />总结:
1. Insight-HXMT观测新黑洞候选天体的QPO。
2. QPO频率在能量变化下的特点。
3. 频率超过8赫兹后的变化速率急剧下降。
4. QPO的rms频率关系可以用Lense-Thirring进动模型解释。
5. 能量与相位滞后之间的关系表明黑洞系统的高倾角性质。 <div>
Based on observations from the Insight Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT), an analysis of type C quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) observed during the outburst of the new black hole candidate Swift J1727.8–1613 in 2023 was conducted. This analysis scrutinized the QPO’s evolution throughout the outburst, particularly noting its rapid frequency escalation during two flare events. Utilizing the energy range covered by Insight-HXMT, a dependency of the QPO frequency on energy was observed. Below approximately 3 Hz, minimal variations in frequency with energy were noted, whereas clear variations with photon energy were observed when it exceeded approximately 3 Hz. Additionally, a sharp drop in the rate of change was observed when the frequency exceeded approximately 8 Hz. This behavior, similar to several previously reported sources, suggests the presence of a common underlying physical mechanism. Moreover, the QPO rms–frequency relationship can be explained by the Lense–Thirring precession model. The relationship between rms energy and phase lag with frequency suggests the black hole system as a high-inclination source.

I conducted a new search for dispersed radio pulses from the X-ray pulsar PSR J0537−6910 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) in a long (11.6 hr) archival 1.4 GHz Parkes search observation. I searched dispersion measures (DMs) between 0 and 10,000 pc cm−3 and detected 49 pulses with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) greater than 7 at a wide range of DMs using the HEIMDALL and FETCH pulse detection and classification packages. All of the pulses were weak, with none having an S/N above 8.5. There was a significant excess of pulses observed in the DM range of the known pulsar population in the LMC, suggesting that these pulses may originate from LMC pulsars. Three repeat pulses, each having widths ≲1 ms, were detected in a single DM trial of 103.412 pc cm−3, which is in the LMC DM range. This is unlikely to occur by chance in a single DM trial in this search at the (marginally significant) 4.3σ level. It remains unclear whether any of the detected pulses in the sample are from PSR J0537−6910 itself.

该研究提出了HaloFlow，这是一种新的机器学习方法，可以从星系的光度和形态推断出宿主暗物质晕的质量Mh。该方法利用基于模拟的推断和正态流进行严格的贝叶斯推断。它在Bottrell等人的最新合成星系图像上进行训练，这些图像是基于IllustrisTNG宇宙大尺度模拟构建的，并包括了Subaru战略计划的Hyper Suprime-Cam观测的实际影响。通过研究发现，HaloFlow能够准确且无偏地推断出Mh的后验分布，还能够量化光度观测在限制Mh方面的全部信息内容。包括形态特征在内显著提高了Mh约束的精确性，并且卫星总亮度也能产生类似的效果。与使用恒星-暗物质晕质量关系的标准方法相比，HaloFlow能够改善Mh的约束力约40%。在接下来的研究中，他们将利用真实观测数据的星系-星系透镜测量来验证和校准HaloFlow。 <div>
We present HaloFlow, a new machine-learning approach for inferring the mass of host dark matter halos, Mh, from the photometry and morphology of galaxies (https://github.com/changhoonhahn/haloflow/). HaloFlow uses simulation-based inference with normalizing flows to conduct rigorous Bayesian inference. It is trained on state-of-the-art synthetic galaxy images from Bottrell et al. that are constructed from the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamic simulation and include realistic effects of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategy Program observations. We design HaloFlow to infer Mh and stellar mass, M*, using grizy band magnitudes, morphological properties quantifying characteristic size, concentration and asymmetry, total measured satellite luminosity, and number of satellites. We demonstrate that HaloFlow infers accurate and unbiased posteriors of Mh. Furthermore, we quantify the full information content in the photometric observations of galaxies in constraining Mh. With magnitudes alone, we infer Mh with and 0.182 dex for field and group galaxies. Including morphological properties significantly improves the precision of Mh constraints, as does total satellite luminosity: and 0.132 dex. Compared to the standard approach using the stellar-to-halo mass relation, we improve Mh constraints by ∼40%. In subsequent papers, we will validate and calibrate HaloFlow with galaxy–galaxy lensing measurements on real observational data.

总结: 这项研究通过JWST/MIRI中红外积分场光谱观测了一个红移为z=2.17的双类类星系J074922.96+225511.7。研究发现，该星系中存在着广泛的星际有机分子和Fe ii发射，星体形成率为103.0±0.2M⊙ yr−1，比对红移为z∼2的星系使用红外光度函数的结果高出5倍。虽然星体形成率与同红移下的星系相当，但这个星系的分子气体含量却低于预期。研究也未观测到任何由类星体驱动的影响星系内PAH和Fe ii的流出现象。这项研究凸显了J0749+2255的极端富含星尘特性，暗示了双类类星体的阶段与强烈的星体形成活动之间可能存在联系。 <br /><br /> <div>
Dual quasars—two active supermassive black holes at galactic scales—represent crucial objects for studying the impact of galaxy mergers and quasar activity on the star formation rate (SFR) within their host galaxies, particularly at cosmic noon when SFR peaks. We present JWST/MIRI mid-infrared integral field spectroscopy of J074922.96+225511.7, a dual quasar with a projected separation of 3.8 kpc at a redshift z = 2.17. We detect spatially extended [Fe ii] 5.34 μm and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) 3.3 μm emissions from the star formation activity in its host galaxy. We derive the SFR of 103.0±0.2M⊙ yr−1 using PAH 3.3 μm, which is 5 times higher than that derived from the knee of the infrared luminosity function for galaxies at z ∼ 2. While the SFR of J0749+2255 agrees with that of star-forming galaxies of comparable stellar mass at the same redshifts, its molecular gas content falls short of expectations based on the molecular Kennicutt–Schmidt law. This discrepancy may result from molecular gas depletion due to the longer elevated stage of star formation, even after the molecular gas reservoir is depleted. We do not observe any quasar-driven outflow that impacts PAH and [Fe ii] in the host galaxy based on the spatially resolved maps. From the expected flux in PAH-based star formation, the [Fe ii] line likely originates from the star-forming regions in the host galaxy. Our study highlights the extreme stardust nature of J0749+2255, indicating a potential connection between the dual quasar phase and intense star formation activities.

总结:
本研究选择了1215个AGN样本，通过检测高电离[Ne v] 3426 Å发射线来研究它们在星系主序列上的行为。我们发现由于AGN的贡献，基于发射线的sSFR值并不可靠。因此，我们使用来自SED的sSFR值来研究主序列。我们发现[Ne v]样本中sSFR沿主序列下降的证据，这与Burst Alert望远镜AGN样本的结果一致。尽管我们没有发现与AGN活动抑制星形成的证据，但我们的结果支持AGN宿主星系的气体分数较星形星系低。如果气体的减少和因此抑制星形成是由于AGN活动引起的，那么这种现象必须发生在先前的时期。 <div>
Studying the behavior along the galaxy main sequence is key in furthering our understanding of the possible connection between active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity and star formation. We select a sample of 1215 AGN from the catalog of Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxy properties from the Portsmouth group by detection of the high-ionization [Ne v] 3426 Å emission line. Our sample extends from 1040 to 1042.5 erg s−1 in [Ne v] luminosity in a redshift range z = 0.17 to 0.57. We compare the specific star formation rates (sSFRs; SFR scaled by galaxy mass) obtained from the corrected [O ii] and Hα luminosities, and the spectral energy distribution (SED)–determined values from Portsmouth. We find that the emission-line-based sSFR values are unreliable for the [Ne v] sample due to the AGN contribution, and proceed with the SED sSFRs for our study of the main sequence. We find evidence for a decrease in sSFR along the main sequence in the [Ne v] sample, which is consistent with results from the hard X-ray Burst Alert Telescope AGN sample, which extends to lower redshifts than our [Ne v] sample. Although we do not find evidence that the concurrent AGN activity is suppressing star formation, our results are consistent with a lower gas fraction in the host galaxies of the AGN as compared to that of the star-forming galaxies. If the evacuation of gas, and therefore suppression of star formation, is due to AGN activity, it must have occurred in a previous epoch.

<br />
通过研究本地星系和高红移星系的相关化学演化, 我们对 Ne, S, Cl 和 Ar 的丰度模式进行了调查, 通过 CLASSY 对局部星系(SFGs)的研究结果,发现 Ne/O, S/O, Cl/O 和 Ar/O 与气相金属丰度的相关性, 对于金属丰度较低的部分没有明显相关性, 但是对于金属丰度较高的部分却存在相关性, 这可能是由于离子校正因子(ICFs)的影响; 以 CLASSY 作为本地参考, 评估了 Ne/O, S/O, Ar/O 在 z > 3 的星系中的演化情况, 发现 Ne/O 没有演化, 而 S/O 和 Ar/O 由于缺乏直接丰度测量而可能会影响对元素演化的解释; 确定了 CLASSY 的基本金属丰度关系(FMR)并与高红移 FMR 进行比较, 发现没有演化; 最后, 对质量-氖关系进行了分析, 发现在后期有轻微的演化。CLASSY 星系的丰度模式和广泛的物理性质范围为解释 JWST 观测到的早期星系的化学丰度提供了重要的基准。 <br /><br />总结: 星际化学演化研究了Ne, S, Cl和Ar在不同金属丰度下的丰度模式，并考虑了ICFs对丰度比例的影响；通过对CLASSY星系和高红移星系的比较，发现Ne/O没有演化，但由于对S/O和Ar/O的缺乏直接丰度测量可能会影响对元素演化的解释；最后进行了质量-氖关系分析，发现在后期存在轻微的演化。CLASSY星系的丰度模式和广泛的物理性质范围为解释JWST观测到的早期星系的化学丰度提供了重要的基准。 <div>
To study the chemical evolution across cosmic epochs, we investigate Ne, S, Cl, and Ar abundance patterns in the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph Legacy Archive Spectroscopic SurveY (CLASSY). CLASSY comprises local star-forming galaxies (SFGs; 0.02 < z < 0.18) with enhanced star formation rates, making them strong analogues to high-z SFGs. With direct measurements of electron temperature, we derive accurate ionic abundances for all elements and assess ionization correction factors (ICFs) to account for unseen ions and derive total abundances. We find Ne/O, S/O, Cl/O, and Ar/O exhibit constant trends with gas-phase metallicity for 12+log(O/H) < 8.5 but significant correlation for Ne/O and Ar/O with metallicity for 12+log(O/H) > 8.5, likely due to ICFs. Thus, the applicability of the ICFs to integrated spectra of galaxies could bias results, underestimating true abundance ratios. Using CLASSY as a local reference, we assess the evolution of Ne/O, S/O, and Ar/O in galaxies at z > 3, finding no cosmic evolution of Ne/O, while the lack of direct abundance determinations for S/O and Ar/O can bias the interpretation of the evolution of these elements. We determine the fundamental metallicity relationship (FMR) for CLASSY and compare to the high-redshift FMR, finding no evolution. Finally, we perform the first mass–neon relationship analysis across cosmic epochs, finding a slight evolution to high Ne at later epochs. The robust abundance patterns of CLASSY galaxies and their broad range of physical properties provide essential benchmarks for interpreting the chemical enrichment of the early galaxies observed with the JWST.

该研究分析了近邻条状螺旋星系M83中的CO到H2转换因子（αCO）。研究人员利用VLA和GBT进行了新的H i观测，并结合了文献中的CO(1-0)积分强度和尘埃表面密度的地图。研究结果表明，αCO和气尘比（δGDR）在半径为1-7千秒差距的环形区域内呈现放射状增加趋势，从中心到边缘的变化因子约为2-3。在整个盘均值上，αCO为3.14（68%置信水平下的范围为2.06到4.96），δGDR为137（68%置信水平下的范围为111到182），与天琴座星系的测量值一致。此外，研究还检验了由于径向金属丰度梯度可能引起的αCO变化的可能性，以及由于基础云团体的变化可能引起的αCO变化的可能性。使用截断的幂律分子云CO亮度函数和云团质量和亮度的经验幂律关系，研究表明基础云团体的变化可能解释αCO的径向变化因子约为1.5-2.0。 
<br /><br />总结: 
该研究分析了近邻条状螺旋星系M83中的CO到H2转换因子（αCO）和气尘比（δGDR）的径向变化趋势，结果表明从该星系中心到边缘，αCO和δGDR都呈现出2-3倍的增加。研究结果显示，这些值与银河系中的测量值一致。此外，研究人员还测试了由于径向金属丰度梯度和基础云团体变化可能引起的αCO变化的可能性。使用分子云CO亮度函数和云团质量与亮度的经验幂律关系，研究表明基础云团体的变化可能解释αCO的径向变化因子约为1.5-2.0。 <div>
We analyze the CO-to-H2 conversion factor (αCO) in the nearby barred spiral galaxy M83. We present new H i observations from the VLA and single-dish GBT in the disk of the galaxy, and combine them with maps of CO(1-0) integrated intensity and dust surface density from the literature. αCO and the gas-to-dust ratio (δGDR) are simultaneously derived in annuli of 2 kpc width from R = 1–7 kpc. We find that αCO and δGDR both increase radially, by a factor of ∼2–3 from the center to the outskirts of the disk. The luminosity-weighted averages over the disk are αCO = 3.14 (2.06, 4.96) and δGDR = 137 (111, 182) at the 68% (1σ) confidence level. These are consistent with the αCO and δGDR values measured in the Milky Way. In addition to possible variations of αCO due to the radial metallicity gradient, we test the possibility of variations in αCO due to changes in the underlying cloud populations, as a function of galactic radius. Using a truncated power-law molecular cloud CO luminosity function and an empirical power-law relation for cloud mass and luminosity, we show that the changes in the underlying cloud population may account for a factor of ∼1.5–2.0 radial change in αCO.

<title>On the Origin of the Variety of Velocity Dispersion Profiles of Galaxies</title>

<div> 关键词: 速度离散度轮廓、积分场光谱学、星体质量、星体形成、宇宙动力学模拟<br />
总结:<br />
本研究使用了来自两项调查的积分场光谱学数据，对比了两个宇宙动力学模拟的结果，发现观测和模拟的星体速度离散度轮廓存在显著差异。内部轮廓主要受到原地形成的年轻和老年星体的相对径向分布的影响，而外部轮廓则受到外积星体的影响。更大质量的星体有更高比例的外积星体，因此外部速度离散度轮廓的斜率更高，并且呈现更强的径向各向异性。外部速度离散度的多样性反映了各个星系组装历史的多样性。 <div>
Observed and simulated galaxies exhibit a significant variation in their velocity dispersion profiles. We examine the inner and outer slopes of stellar velocity dispersion profiles using integral field spectroscopy data from two surveys, SAMI (for z < 0.115) and CALIFA (for z < 0.03), comparing them with results from two cosmological hydrodynamic simulations: Horizon-AGN (for z = 0.017) and NewHorizon (for z ≲ 1). The simulated galaxies closely reproduce the variety of velocity dispersion slopes and stellar mass dependence of both inner and outer radii (0.5 r50 and 3 r50) as observed, where r50 stands for half-light radius. The inner slopes are mainly influenced by the relative radial distribution of the young and old stars formed in situ: a younger center shows a flatter inner profile. The presence of accreted (ex situ) stars has two effects on the velocity dispersion profiles. First, because they are more dispersed in spatial and velocity distributions compared to in situ formed stars, it increases the outer slope of the velocity dispersion profile. It also causes the velocity anisotropy to be more radial. More massive galaxies have a higher fraction of stars formed ex situ and hence show a higher slope in outer velocity dispersion profile and a higher degree of radial anisotropy. The diversity in the outer velocity dispersion profiles reflects the diverse assembly histories among galaxies.

<div> ULXPs, pulsars, accretion flow, X-ray study, magnetosphere
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了NGC 5907 ULX1这个极端亮的超光源X射线脉冲星。研究利用2014年7月XMM-Newton和NuSTAR同时观测的数据进行了广带X射线研究。文章显示，相位分辨光谱可以用一个模型很好地再现，其中包含一个温度梯度为p = 0.5的多色盘黑体辐射和一个带有指数截断的幂律。盘部分是相位不变的，具有约0.3 keV的最内温度，其归一化值表明盘的倾角相对较低，与其他文献中的先前声明相矛盾。幂律成分归因于在中子星的磁层内的吸积流发射，显示出相位相关的光谱形状变化；前峰相位的光谱略硬于后峰相位。这意味着磁层在磁轴周围具有不对称的几何结构，并且在脉冲峰之前，靠近磁极的热区域变得可见。 <div>
The discovery of coherent pulsations from several ultraluminous X-ray pulsars (ULXPs) has provided direct evidence of a supercritical accretion flow. However, the geometrical structure of such an accretion flow onto the central neutron star remains poorly understood. NGC 5907 ULX1 is one of the most luminous ULXPs, with a luminosity exceeding 1041 erg s−1. Here we present a broadband X-ray study of this ULXP using the data from simultaneous observations with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR conducted in 2014 July. The phase-resolved spectra are well reproduced by a model consisting of a multicolor disk blackbody emission with a temperature gradient of p = 0.5 (T ∝ r−p) and a power law with an exponential cutoff. The disk component is phase-invariant and has an innermost temperature of ∼ 0.3 keV. Its normalization suggests a relatively low inclination angle of the disk, in contrast to the previous claims in other literature. The power-law component, attributed to the emission from the accretion flow inside the magnetosphere of the neutron star, indicates phase-dependent spectral shape changes; the spectrum is slightly harder in the pre-peak phase than in the post-peak phase. This implies that the magnetosphere has an asymmetric geometry around the magnetic axis and that hotter regions close to the magnetic pole become visible before the pulse peak.

In the absence of a parallax distance to a pulsar or a surviving binary in a supernova remnant (SNR), distances to Galactic SNRs are generally very uncertain. However, by combining Gaia data with wide-field, multifiber echelle spectroscopy, it is now possible to obtain accurate distances to many SNRs with limited extinction by searching for the appearance of high-velocity Ca ii or Na i absorption lines in hot stars as a function of distance. We demonstrate this for the SNR S147 using the spectra of 259 luminous blue stars. We obtain a median distance of 1.37 kpc (1.30–1.47 kpc at 90% confidence), which is consistent with the median parallax distance to the pulsar of 1.46 kpc (1.12–2.10 kpc at 90% confidence) but with significantly smaller uncertainties. Our distance is also consistent with the distance to the candidate unbound binary companion in this SNR, HD 37424 at a photogeometric distance of 1.45 kpc (1.40–1.50 kpc at 1σ). The presence of high-velocity absorption lines is correlated with the Hα/O [iii] emission-line flux of the SNR but not with the radio flux.

Solar activities have an extraordinary impact on interplanetary space, enriching the plasma dynamics including turbulent heating of various species. The small fraction of alpha particles is believed to play a significant role in the turbulent dynamics of the solar wind. Here we present fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations to reveal the influences of the alpha particles in decaying plasma turbulence. Multiple run cases with different controlled variations of proton and alpha density are performed to compare and evaluate the energy conversion processes. It is found that the alpha particles can suppress the energy conversion rate with increasing density. Besides, the alpha particles show more heating intermittency than the proton species. Interestingly, on the other hand, the electrons do not show any change in their dynamics, including overall heating. These two positive charge species have more correlation in temperature anisotropy as their densities are comparable. Our results provide valuable insights on the turbulence with different species compositions to a certain extent, especially with abundant heavy particles.

总结:
该研究使用PHANGS-MUSE和PHANGS-ALMA调查的数据，对四个条状星系进行研究，通过Hα速度梯度图突出显示了条的驱动震荡和剪切。研究发现，在条状星系中，速度梯度增强的区域抑制了星的形成，大部分这些区域被分类为低电离核发射线区域(LINER)或复合区。研究结果与数值模拟结果一致，表明剪切力强的条状星系中，星的形成被抑制。 <div>
Bars drive gas inflow. As the gas flows inward, shocks and shear occur along the bar dust lanes. Such shocks and shear can affect the star formation (SF) and change the gas properties. For four barred galaxies, we present Hα velocity gradient maps that highlight bar-driven shocks and shear using data from the PHANGS-MUSE and PHANGS-ALMA surveys, which allow us to study bar kinematics in unprecedented detail. Velocity gradients are enhanced along the bar dust lanes, where shocks and shear are shown to occur in numerical simulations. Velocity gradient maps also efficiently pick up H ii regions that are expanding or moving relative to the surroundings. We put pseudo-slits on the regions where velocity gradients are enhanced and find that Hα and CO velocities jump up to ∼170 km s−1, even after removing the effects of circular motions due to the galaxy rotation. Enhanced velocity gradients either coincide with the peak of CO intensity along the bar dust lanes or are slightly offset from CO intensity peaks, depending on the objects. Using the Baldwin–Philips–Terlevich BPT diagnostic, we identify the source of ionization on each spaxel and find that SF is inhibited in the high-velocity gradient regions of the bar, and the majority of those regions are classified as a low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) or composite. This implies that SF is inhibited where bar-driven shear and shocks are strong. Our results are consistent with the results from the numerical simulations that show SF is inhibited in the bar where the shear force is strong.

这篇研究探讨了暗物质核对快速旋转中子星的影响，使用了两流近似，并假设了重子物质和暗物质之间的最小相互作用。研究采用了费米子和玻色子暗物质的现象学模型，发现由于旋转而导致的质量和半径变化的普适关系在存在暗物质核的情况下仍然基本保持不变。具体地，对于5%的暗物质质量分数，总质量（Mtot）、重子赤道半径（RBe）和极赤比（RratioB）的百分比偏差分别在3.9%、1.8%和1.4%以内。这些发现表明，可以利用控制中子星形状的普适关系来推断暗物质核的性质约束，即使在暗物质显著软化中子星的状态方程的情况下也是如此。 <div>
Neutron stars represent unique laboratories, offering insights into the physics of supranuclear-density matter and serving as potential hosts for dark matter. This study explores the impact of dark matter cores on rapidly rotating neutron stars through the two-fluid approximation, assuming minimal interaction between baryonic matter and dark matter. The investigation employs phenomenological models for fermionic and bosonic dark matter, revealing that universal relations governing mass and radius changes due to rotation remain largely unaffected in the presence of a dark matter core. Specifically, for a 5% dark matter mass fraction, the percent deviations in total mass (Mtot), the baryonic equatorial radius (RBe), and polar-to-equatorial baryonic radius ratio (RratioB) are within 3.9%, 1.8%, and 1.4%, respectively. These findings suggest that the universal relations governing neutron star shape can be utilized to infer constraints on the properties of dark matter cores even in cases where the dark matter significantly softens the neutron star’s equation of state.

Following the high activity of the γ-ray Fermi source 4FGL J0449.1+1121 (PKS 0446+112), possibly associated with a IceCube neutrino event IC-240105A, we obtained optical spectroscopy with the Gran Telescopio Canarias of the counterpart. We detect a clear emission line at 3830 Å identified as Lyα that confirms the redshift of source at z = 2.153. Comparing with previous spectroscopy, we find an increase of the continuum by a factor ∼10, and a significant decrease of the C iv 1550 emission line flux by a factor ∼5. This produces a dramatic drop of the equivalent width from ∼20 to 0.8 Å, which is suggestive of a very high jet activity. The full width half maximum of the emission lines are midway (1000–2000 km s −1) between those typical of the broad and narrow regions of quasars. Based on this, the source classification is intermediate between flat spectrum radio quasar and BL Lac object.

本研究利用JWST确定的红移范围为z = 9–14.5的星系紫外线亮度函数，推导出对暖暗物质模型的约束。通过与HST在红移z = 4–8进行的空白场调查相结合，同时对天体物理参数（双重幂律星系形成效率的β、γ、ϵN和Mc，以及高斯等级-暗物质质量关系）和WDM参数（暗物质粒子质量mx）施加约束。在95%的置信水平下，得到了热暗物质粒子质量mx ≥ 3.2千电子伏的新界限。这个界限比之前使用HST数据得到的最严格结果更紧。未来JWST观测可能进一步减少观测不确定性，并改善这一约束。 <div>
We exploit the recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) determination of galaxy UV luminosity functions over the redshift range z = 9–14.5 to derive constraints on warm dark matter (WDM) models. The delayed structure formations in WDM universes make high-redshift observations a powerful probe to set limits on the particle mass mx of WDM candidates. By integrating these observations with blank-field surveys conducted by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) at redshifts z = 4–8, we impose constraints on both astrophysical parameters (β, γ, ϵN, and Mc for a double-power-law star formation efficiency, and for a Gaussian magnitude–halo mass relation) and the WDM parameter (dark matter particle mass mx) simultaneously. We find a new limit of mx ≥ 3.2 keV for the mass of thermal relic WDM particles at a 95% confidence level. This bound is tighter than the most stringent result derived using HST data before. Future JWST observations could further reduce the observation uncertainties and improve this constraint.

<div> 关键词: 二进制星系统, 密集环境, 气体相互作用, 软-硬界限, 形成过程
总结:<br /><br />
本研究探讨了在密集环境中气体对二进制星系统软化的影响以及其后果。我们发现气体相互作用实际上可以硬化二进制星系统，并将软–硬界限扩展到更大的分离距离。这为二进制星系统硬化提出了一个“屏蔽半径”的概念，使得一部分最初被分类为“软”二进制系统在考虑到气体和恒星的情况下实际上变得“硬”。我们提出了硬二进制系统的两阶段形成过程：初始形成软二进制系统，无论是动力学而来还是通过气体辅助捕获，然后经过气体诱导硬化，最终发生破裂。在气体密度低但气体含量高的环境中，屏蔽半径可能超过典型的硬–软界限一个数量级，导致显著比例的最初软二进制系统实际上成为硬二进制系统。相反，在气体密度较高的环境中，气体诱导硬化可能占主导地位，潜在地使整个二进制星系统呈硬状态。气体硬化成为塑造气体丰富环境中二进制星系统群体的关键因素，例如星团、成星区和可能的活动星系核盘中。这凸显了气体动力学和恒星相互作用在密集环境中二进制星系统演化中的复杂相互作用。 <div>
Binaries in dense environments are traditionally classified as soft or hard based on their binding energy relative to the kinetic energy of surrounding stars. Heggie’s law suggests that stellar encounters tend to soften soft binaries and harden hard binaries, altering their separations. However, interactions with gas in such environments can significantly modify this behavior. This study investigates the impact of gas on binary softening and its consequences. We find that gas interactions can actually harden binaries, extending the soft–hard boundary to larger separations. This introduces a “shielding radius” within which binaries are likely to harden due to gas interactions, surpassing the traditional soft–hard limit. Consequently, a notable portion of binaries initially classified as “soft” may become “hard” when both gas and stars are considered. We propose a two-stage formation process for hard binaries: initial soft binary formation, either dynamically or through gas-assisted capture, followed by gas-induced hardening before eventual disruption. In environments with low gas density but high gas content, the shielding radius could exceed the typical hard–soft limit by 1 order of magnitude, leading to a significant fraction of originally soft binaries effectively becoming hard. Conversely, in high-gas-density environments, gas-induced hardening may dominate, potentially rendering the entire binary population hard. Gas hardening emerges as a crucial factor in shaping binary populations in gas-rich settings, such as clusters, star-forming regions, and possibly active galactic nucleus disks. This highlights the complex interplay between gas dynamics and stellar interactions in binary evolution within dense environments.

<div> 红移，宽吸收线，类星体，光度，黑洞质量
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了65个BAL类星体和195个非BAL类星体的光谱特性，发现在红移1.55≲z≲3.50范围内，光度较高的BAL类星体在光学波段的光谱上与非BAL类星体没有明显区别。研究也表明BAL吸收槽的特性与Hβ基础的超大质量黑洞质量和规范化的吸积率之间没有相关性。此外，研究发现在静止2500埃的单色光度≳1045 erg s−1是BAL类星体产生吸收流的必要条件。综合其他研究，该文讨论了吸积率和方位对类星体光谱中BAL吸收槽出现的影响。 <div>
We present the rest-frame ultraviolet−optical spectral properties of 65 broad absorption line (BAL) quasars from the Gemini Near Infrared Spectrograph−Distant Quasar Survey (GNIRS-DQS). These properties are compared with those of 195 non-BAL quasars from GNIRS-DQS in order to identify the drivers for the appearance of BALs in quasar spectra. In particular, we compare equivalent widths and velocity widths, as well as velocity offsets from systemic redshifts, of principal emission lines. In spite of the differences between their rest-frame ultraviolet spectra, we find that luminous BAL quasars are generally indistinguishable from their non-BAL counterparts in the rest-frame optical band at redshifts 1.55 ≲ z ≲ 3.50. We do not find any correlation between BAL trough properties and the Hβ-based supermassive black hole masses and normalized accretion rates in our sample. Considering the Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasar sample, which includes the GNIRS-DQS sample, we find that a monochromatic luminosity at rest-frame 2500 Å of ≳1045 erg s−1 is a necessary condition for launching BAL outflows in quasars. We compare our findings with other BAL quasar samples and discuss the roles that accretion rate and orientation play in the appearance of BAL troughs in quasar spectra.

观测显示，黑洞X射线双星Swift J1727.8-1613的X射线极化随着硬到软态转变首次呈现出变化。极化度从约4%下降至约3%，但极化角度始终保持在北-南方向。澳大利亚天文台紧凑阵列的观测结果显示，7.25 GHz射电极化与X射线极化方向一致。这表明X射线冠层沿盘面延伸，而不是沿喷流轴，这意味着我们测量的软延迟主要由于其他过程而不是纯粹的光穿越延迟。此外，我们发现软延迟振幅随光谱状态的演变不符合其他源的趋势，这意味着Swift J1727.8–1613是一个未被充分采样的亚种群的成员。<br /><br />总结: 观测显示黑洞X射线双星Swift J1727.8-1613的X射线极化随着硬到软态转变首次呈现出变化。极化度从约4%下降至约3%，但极化角度始终保持在北-南方向。澳大利亚天文台紧凑阵列的观测结果显示，7.25 GHz射电极化与X射线极化方向一致。这表明X射线冠层沿盘面延伸，而不是沿喷流轴，这意味着我们测量的软延迟主要由于其他过程而不是纯粹的光穿越延迟。此外，我们发现软延迟振幅随光谱状态的演变不符合其他源的趋势，这意味着Swift J1727.8–1613是一个未被充分采样的亚种群的成员。 <div>
We report on an observational campaign on the bright black hole (BH) X-ray binary Swift J1727.8–1613 centered around five observations by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer. These observations track for the first time the evolution of the X-ray polarization of a BH X-ray binary across a hard to soft state transition. The 2–8 keV polarization degree decreased from ∼4% to ∼3% across the five observations, but the polarization angle remained oriented in the north–south direction throughout. Based on observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we find that the intrinsic 7.25 GHz radio polarization aligns with the X-ray polarization. Assuming the radio polarization aligns with the jet direction (which can be tested in the future with higher-spatial-resolution images of the jet), our results imply that the X-ray corona is extended in the disk plane, rather than along the jet axis, for the entire hard intermediate state. This in turn implies that the long (≳10 ms) soft lags that we measure with the Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR are dominated by processes other than pure light-crossing delays. Moreover, we find that the evolution of the soft lag amplitude with spectral state does not follow the trend seen for other sources, implying that Swift J1727.8–1613 is a member of a hitherto undersampled subpopulation.

A fundamental prediction of the Lambda cold dark matter cosmology is the centrally divergent cuspy density profile of dark matter haloes. Density cusps render cold dark matter haloes resilient to tides, and protect dwarf galaxies embedded in them from full tidal disruption. The hierarchical assembly history of the Milky Way may therefore give rise to a population of “microgalaxies”; i.e., heavily stripped remnants of early accreted satellites, which can reach arbitrarily low luminosity. Assuming that the progenitor systems are dark matter dominated, we use an empirical formalism for tidal stripping to predict the evolution of the luminosity, size, and velocity dispersion of such remnants, tracing their tidal evolution across multiple orders of magnitude in mass and size. The evolutionary tracks depend sensitively on the progenitor distribution of stellar binding energies. We explore three cases that likely bracket most realistic models of dwarf galaxies: one where the energy distribution of the most tightly bound stars follows that of the dark matter, and two where stars are defined by either an exponential density or surface brightness profile. The tidal evolution in the size–velocity dispersion plane is quite similar for these three models, although their remnants may differ widely in luminosity. Microgalaxies are therefore best distinguished from globular clusters by the presence of dark matter; either directly, by measuring their velocity dispersion, or indirectly, by examining their tidal resilience. Our work highlights the need for further theoretical and observational constraints on the stellar energy distribution in dwarf galaxies.

EX Lupi, a low-mass young stellar object, went into an accretion-driven outburst in 2022 March. The outburst caused a sudden phase change of ∼112° ± 5° in periodically oscillating multiband lightcurves. Our high-resolution spectra obtained with the High Resolution Spectrograph (HRS) on board the Southern African Large Telescope also revealed a consistent phase change in the periodically varying radial velocities (RVs), along with an increase in the RV amplitude of various emission lines. The phase change and increase in RV amplitude morphologically translates to a change in the azimuthal and latitudinal location of the accretion hotspot over the stellar surface, which indicates a reconfiguration of the accretion funnel geometry. Our three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations reproduce the phase change for EX Lupi. To explain the observations, we explored the possibility of forward shifting of the dipolar accretion funnel as well as the possibility of the emergence of a new accretion funnel. During the outburst, we also found evidence of the hotspot’s morphology extending azimuthally asymmetrically with a leading hot edge and cold tail along the stellar rotation. Further, our high-cadence photometry showed that the accretion flow has clumps. We also detected possible clumpy accretion events in the HRS spectra that showed episodically highly blueshifted wings in the Ca ii IR triplet and Balmer H lines.

通过Chandra任务观测的软X射线区域的O vii和Fe xvii线系，估计了卡佩拉的日冕密度。分析结合了由于基础原子数据不确定性导致的误差和Chandra数据中的统计误差，推导出了卡佩拉日冕的密度的总体不确定性。我们考虑了两种贝叶斯框架。第一种是所谓的务实贝叶斯方法，该方法将原子数据及其不确定性视为完全指定和不可校正。另一种完全贝叶斯方法允许观察到的谱数据更新原子数据及其不确定性，从而降低了所推导参数的整体误差。为了纳入原子数据的不确定性，我们获得了一组原子数据副本，它们的分布捕获了其不确定性。这些副本的主成分分析允许我们用低维多元高斯分布来表示原子不确定性。我们通过t分布近似了包含先验温度信息的部分等离子体参数的不确定性，该信息来自于对温度敏感的Fe xvii谱线分析。我们实施了基于马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛模型拟合，包括多步蒙特卡洛吉布斯采样器和哈密顿蒙特卡洛。我们的分析得出了近似等温的日冕等离子体温度为≈5 MK，日冕等离子体密度为≈1010 cm−3，对应的不确定性分别为0.1和0.2 dex。 
<br /><br />总结: Chandra任务观测了Capella的软X射线，通过Bayesian方法估计了其日冕密度，考虑了原子数据的不确定性。利用马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛模型拟合，分析得出日冕等离子体温度约为5MK，密度约为10^10cm−3，相应的不确定性分别为0.1和0.2 dex。 <div>
We estimate the coronal density of Capella using the O vii and Fe xvii line systems in the soft X-ray regime that have been observed over the course of the Chandra mission. Our analysis combines measures of error due to uncertainty in the underlying atomic data with statistical errors in the Chandra data to derive meaningful overall uncertainties on the plasma density of the coronae of Capella. We consider two Bayesian frameworks. First, the so-called pragmatic Bayesian approach considers the atomic data and their uncertainties as fully specified and uncorrectable. The fully Bayesian approach, on the other hand, allows the observed spectral data to update the atomic data and their uncertainties, thereby reducing the overall errors on the inferred parameters. To incorporate atomic data uncertainties, we obtain a set of atomic data replicates, the distribution of which captures their uncertainty. A principal component analysis of these replicates allows us to represent the atomic uncertainty with a lower-dimensional multivariate Gaussian distribution. A t-distribution approximation of the uncertainties of a subset of plasma parameters including a priori temperature information, obtained from the temperature-sensitive-only Fe xvii spectral line analysis, is carried forward into the density- and temperature-sensitive O vii spectral line analysis. Markov Chain Monte Carlo based model fitting is implemented including Multi-step Monte Carlo Gibbs Sampler and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Our analysis recovers an isothermally approximated coronal plasma temperature of ≈5 MK and a coronal plasma density of ≈1010 cm−3, with uncertainties of 0.1 and 0.2 dex, respectively.

<div> 高红移星系，气体旋转，星系演化，动力学模拟，星系形成<br />
<br />根据最近的观测，高红移星系中有相当比例的星系具有湍流的、富含气体的盘状结构，其中有规律的旋转和高水平的星形成。一些星系盘还显示出螺旋臂和棒状结构。这些观测结果鼓励我们利用agama/Ramses模拟框架探索一种新的动力学自洽模型，模拟高红移时期可能的银河系的祖先。我们研究了盘状气体分数为fgas = 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 和 100%的情况，并追踪了恒星和金属的形成。高气体表面密度促进了剧烈的恒星形成，而后者又与气体耦合产生湍流。我们研究了三种不同的发展历程：(i) 没有持续的吸积，气体被恒星形成消耗；(ii) 星形成的气体通过冷却在热暗物质晕中得到补充；(iii) 在另一篇文章中，我们讨论这些模型在存在强扰动力的情况下的情况。对于低fdisk（≲0.3）的情况，即盘状暗物质相对于2.2 Rdisk内盘状暗物质的质量分数，星系盘不会形成棒状结构；即使在气体主导内部盘的情况下也是如此。对于占主导地位的重子盘（fdisk ≳ 0.5），在所有气体分数下，湍流气体形成强烈的径向剪切流，大约在500百万年内形成间歇性的形成棒状结构；与无气体模型相比，湍流气体加速了形成棒状结构的速度。对于fgas≲ 60%，所有的棒状结构都能生存，但对于更高的气体分数，棒状结构在1亿年后演变为中央的星系球状结构。这些正在形成恒星的棒状结构与近期发现的高红移阿塔卡马大口径/亚毫米阵列观测到的气体盘结构相似。<br /><br />总结: 
1. 高红移星系中存在具有湍流气体盘和高速星形成的现象；
2. 利用动力学模拟框架探索高红移时期的银河系的祖先；
3. 高气体表面密度促进了剧烈的恒星形成，并与气体耦合产生湍流；
4. 低质量比例的盘状结构不会形成棒状结构，而高比例的盘状结构会形成棒状结构；

Recent observations of high-redshift galaxies (z ≲ 7) reveal that a substantial fraction have turbulent, gas-rich disks with well-ordered rotation and elevated levels of star formation. In some instances, disks show evidence of spiral arms, with bar-like structures. These remarkable observations have encouraged us to explore a new class of dynamically self-consistent models using our agama/Ramses hydrodynamic N-body simulation framework that mimic a plausible progenitor of the Milky Way at high redshift. We explore disk gas fractions of fgas = 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% and track the creation of stars and metals. The high gas surface densities encourage vigorous star formation, which in turn couples with the gas to drive turbulence. We explore three distinct histories: (i) there is no ongoing accretion and the gas is used up by the star formation, (ii) the star-forming gas is replenished by cooling in the hot halo gas, and (iii) in a companion paper, we revisit these models in the presence of a strong perturbing force. At low fdisk (≲0.3), where fdisk is the baryon mass fraction of the disk relative to dark matter within 2.2 Rdisk, a bar does not form in a stellar disk; this remains true even when gas dominates the inner disk potential. For a dominant baryon disk (fdisk ≳ 0.5) at all gas fractions, the turbulent gas forms a strong radial shear flow that leads to an intermittent star-forming bar within about 500 Myr; turbulent gas speeds up the formation of bars compared to gas-free models. For fgas ≲ 60%, all bars survive, but for higher gas fractions, the bar devolves into a central bulge after 1 Gyr. The star-forming bars are reminiscent of recent discoveries in high-redshift Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of gaseous disks.

<div> 波动火车, 快速传播, 阶段振荡, 能量释放, 爆发太阳丝<br />
总结:<br />
本文描述了2023年4月21日发生的三种不同的波动火车：一个宽广的准周期快速传播(QFP)波动火车和双向窄QFP波动火车。宽广的QFP波动火车以圆形波前向外扩散，而双向窄QFP波动火车分别向南北方向传播。这些波动火车的同时出现提供了一个研究它们各自触发机制的良好机会。测量结果显示，宽广的QFP波动火车在不同传播方向的速度范围为300-1100 km/s。双向窄QFP波动火车的速度有显著差异：以1400 km/s的速度向南传播，而向北传播只达到约550 km/s，并伴随着约1-2 km/s²的减速。使用小波分析，我们发现向南北方向传播的波动火车的周期性与耀斑所表现出的准周期脉动非常相似。基于这些结果，窄QFP波动火车很可能是由伴随耀斑的间歇能量释放所激发的。相反，宽广的QFP波动火车与喷发的太阳丝紧密相关，可能归因于喷发太阳丝的展开运动或者快速腔波在太阳丝体内的泄漏。 <div>
This paper presents three distinct wave trains that occurred on 2023 April 21: a broad quasiperiodic fast-propagating (QFP) wave train and bidirectional narrow QFP wave trains. The broad QFP wave train expands outward in a circular wave front, while bidirectional narrow QFP wave trains propagate in the northward and southward directions, respectively. The concurrent presence of the wave trains offers a remarkable opportunity to investigate their respective triggering mechanisms. Measurement shows that the speed of the broad QFP wave train is in the range of 300–1100 km s−1 in different propagating directions. There is a significant difference in the speed of the bidirectional narrow QFP wave trains: the southward propagation achieves 1400 km s−1, while the northward propagation only reaches about 550 km s−1 accompanied by a deceleration of about 1–2 km s−2. Using the wavelet analysis, we find that the periodicity of the propagating wave trains in the southward and northward directions closely matches the quasiperiodic pulsations exhibited by the flares. Based on these results, the narrow QFP wave trains were most likely excited by the intermittent energy release in the accompanying flare. In contrast, the broad QFP wave train had a tight relationship with the erupting filament, probably attributed to the unwinding motion of the erupting filament, or the leakage of the fast sausage wave train inside the filament body.

<div> 关键词: 太阳风, 火星, 地球, 磁层重连接, 能量传输

总结:
太阳风对火星和地球的影响被用全球磁流体力学数值模拟进行了比较。火星缺乏类似地球的全球偶极磁场，而是在南半球高地附近有小尺度的地壳磁场。与地球磁层重连接不同的是，火星的磁堆积边界重连接发生在太阳天顶角约45°的位置（在南向IMF下，或在北向IMF下接近太阳尾部），导致了南北半球之间能量传输的不对称性。在南向（北向）IMF下，火星机械能的流出在太阳天顶角约45°的位置出现（太阳天顶角约30°和60°），伴随着“太阳风拾取”过程的流入。在不论IMF是北向还是南向的情况下，磁堆积边界的能量传输中，电磁能输入是机械能输入的两倍，这与地球在南向IMF下的磁层重连接相似，但在北向IMF下则相反。火星磁堆积边界的能量传输速率在北向IMF下略高于南向IMF，而地球磁层的能量传输速率在南向IMF下远高于北向IMF。 <div>
Using a global magnetohydrodynamics numerical simulation, this work compares the interaction of the solar wind with Mars and Earth from the perspective of energy transfer under north–south interplanetary magnetic fields (IMFs). Mars lacks a global dipole magnetic field like Earth’s and instead has a small-scale crustal magnetic field near highlands in the southern hemisphere. Unlike Earth’s magnetopause reconnection (at the subsolar point or tail under a southward IMF, or behind the cusp under a northward IMF), the reconnection of the Martian magnetic pileup boundary (MPB) occurs near solar zenith angle (SZA) ≈ 45° (SZA ≈ 30° and 60°) for a southward (northward) IMF, resulting in asymmetric energy transfer between the northern and southern hemispheres. The Martian outflow of mechanical energy appears near SZA ≈ 45° (SZA ≈ 30° and 60°) under a southward (northward) IMF, accompanied by an inflow due to the process of “solar wind pickup.” For energy transfer across the MPB, whether the IMF is northward or southward, the input of electromagnetic energy is twice as large as the input of mechanical energy, which is similar to Earth’s magnetopause for a southward IMF, but opposite to it for a northward IMF. The energy transfer rate of the MPB is slightly higher in a northward IMF than in a southward one, whereas the energy transfer rate of Earth’s magnetopause is far higher in a southward IMF than in a northward one.

总结: 
磁洞是空间等离子体中的磁场凹陷，本文报道了两个大尺度磁洞MH1和MH2，首次在其中探测到高达100keV的高能电子。两个磁洞具有许多相似特征，如空间尺度、温度和总压力增加，以及其中的高能电子呈幂律分布。然而，它们也存在一些不同之处，MH1内部探测到了离子流涡和离子尺度的磁结构，并且高能电子的行为也不同于MH2。此外，MH1周围存在镜模不稳定性，而MH2周围则稳定，这表明两个磁洞可能处于不同的镜模不稳定性阶段。观测结果表明，在不同的阶段，电子可能在磁洞内得到显著加速。 <div>
Magnetic holes, characterized as magnetic field depressions, have been widely observed in space plasma. Two large-scale magnetic holes, MH1 and MH2, were reported in this paper and the energetic electrons up to 100 keV were detected for the first time inside both holes. The two holes showed many similar features, comparable spatial scale, temperature and total pressure increase, and energetic electrons up to 100 keV with a power-law distribution inside them. On the other hand, distinct features were also found between these two holes. A potential ion flow vortex was detected inside the MH1 and an ion-scale magnetic structure was observed in its core region. The electron flux enhancements were associated with this ion-scale structure and the energetic electrons were nonadiabatic around the ion-scale structure inside MH1, while the energetic electrons were adiabatic inside the MH2. The mirror-mode instability was unstable around MH1 while stable around MH2, which suggested that the two holes might be in a different phase of the mirror-mode instability. The observations suggested that the electrons could be significantly accelerated inside magnetic holes in the different phases.

For the first time, systematic studies of dwarf galaxies are being conducted throughout the Local Volume, including the dwarf satellites of the nearby giant elliptical galaxy Centaurus A (NGC 5128). Given Centaurus A's mass (roughly 10 times larger than that of the Milky Way), AGN activity, and recent major mergers, investigating the dwarf galaxies of Centaurus A and their star formation physics is imperative. However, simulating the faintest dwarfs around a galaxy of Centaurus A's mass with sufficient resolution in a hydrodynamic simulation is computationally expensive and currently infeasible. In this study, we seek to reproduce the properties of Centaurus A dwarfs using the semianalytic model Galacticus to model dwarfs within a 700 kpc region around Centaurus A, corresponding approximately to its splashback radius. We investigate the effects of host halo mass and environment and predict observable properties of Centaurus A dwarfs using astrophysical prescriptions and parameters previously tuned to match properties of the Milky Way’s satellite galaxies. This approach allows us to approximately replicate cumulative luminosity functions, and luminosity–metallicity and luminosity–half-light-radii relations observed in the Centaurus A satellites. We provide predictions for the velocity dispersions, and star formation histories of Centaurus A dwarfs. The agreement between our predicted star formation histories for Centaurus A dwarfs and those of the Milky Way dwarfs implies the presence of universal processes governing star formation in dwarf galaxies. Overall, our findings shed light on the star formation physics of dwarf galaxies in the Centaurus A system, revealing insights into their properties and dependence on the host environment.

本研究提出了一种新的三维磁流体动力学模型和一种新的三维高能粒子输运模型。磁流体动力学模型使用松弛总变差减小方案数值求解理想MHD方程。在磁流体动力学模拟中，使用了高速流的简单边界条件，清晰地识别了一个具有前向冲击波和反向冲击波特征的日冕相互作用区（CIR）。高能粒子输运模型使用Fokker-Planck输运方程求解太阳高能粒子，利用了磁场和太阳风速场的MHD结果。我们的模拟结果表明，压缩磁场区域可以作为散射高能粒子的屏障，并且粒子可能在强磁场区域扩散困难。这一结果可用于复制航天器观测到的异常各向异性现象。 <div>
We present a new three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model and a new 3D energetic particle transport (EPT) model. The 3D MHD model numerically solves the ideal MHD equations using the relaxing total variation diminishing scheme. In the 3D MHD simulations, we use simple boundary conditions with a high-speed flow, and we can clearly identify a corotating interaction region (CIR) with the characteristics of forward shock and reverse shock. The 3D EPT model solves the Fokker–Planck transport equation for the solar energetic particles (SEPs) using backward stochastic processes, with the magnetic field and solar wind velocity field from MHD results. For comparison, the 3D EPT model results with Parker fields are also obtained. We investigate the transport of SEPs with particle sources and observers in different positions in MHD fields with a CIR, and we compare the results with those in the Parker fields. Our simulation results show that the compression region with local enhancement of the magnetic field, i.e., CIR, can act as a barrier to scatter energetic particles back, and particles can struggle to diffuse through the strong magnetic field regions. Usually, a normal anisotropy profile is commonly present in SEP simulation results with Parker fields, and it is also typically present in that with MHD fields. However, because of the compression region of the magnetic field, energetic particles may exhibit anomalous anisotropy. This result may be used to replicate the spacecraft observation phenomena of the anomalous anisotropy.

总结: 
多探测方法对星系团并合提供了重要信息，但是观测到的信号复杂且难以解释。ICM-SHOX框架以系统性的方式利用多种观测方法，并通过与模拟观测数据的比较得出星系团并合的各项参数。研究结果表明MACS J0018.5+1626的并合在近地点通过后约0-60百万年，观测角度离并合轴线倾斜约27°-40°。影响参数约为250千秒差距，质量比约为1.5-3.0，初次相对速度约在1700-3000km/s。同时发现DM和气体成分在速度空间上分离，这与并合的历史、几何结构和观测角度相关。 <div>
Galaxy cluster mergers are rich sources of information to test cluster astrophysics and cosmology. However, cluster mergers produce complex projected signals that are difficult to interpret physically from individual observational probes. Multi-probe constraints on the gas and dark matter (DM) cluster components are necessary to infer merger parameters that are otherwise degenerate. We present Improved Constraints on Mergers with SZ, Hydrodynamical simulations, Optical, and X-ray (ICM-SHOX), a systematic framework to jointly infer multiple merger parameters quantitatively via a pipeline that directly compares a novel combination of multi-probe observables to mock observables derived from hydrodynamical simulations. We report a first application of the ICM-SHOX pipeline to MACS J0018.5+1626, wherein we systematically examine simulated snapshots characterized by a wide range of initial parameters to constrain the MACS J0018.5+1626 merger geometry. We constrain the epoch of MACS J0018.5+1626 to the range 0–60 Myr post-pericenter passage, and the viewing angle is inclined ≈27°–40° from the merger axis. We obtain constraints for the impact parameter (≲250 kpc), mass ratio (≈1.5–3.0), and initial relative velocity when the clusters are separated by 3 Mpc (≈1700–3000 km s−1). The primary and secondary clusters initially (at 3 Mpc) have gas distributions that are moderately and strongly disturbed, respectively. We discover a velocity space decoupling of the DM and gas distributions in MACS J0018.5+1626, traced by cluster-member galaxy velocities and the kinematic Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect, respectively. Our simulations indicate this decoupling is dependent on the different collisional properties of the two distributions for particular merger epochs, geometries, and viewing angles.

<div> 太阳辐射，密度波动，频率扩散，离子声波，阿尔文波<br />
总结:<br />
文章讨论了太阳辐射通过太阳冕层和太阳风传播时受到的影响，提出了一种新的密度波动模型，并推断了等离子体速度以解释观测到的信号频率扩散。推断的速度与太阳风的主导运动一致，但较小尺度范围内的频率扩展需要额外的径向和/或横向速度。推断的径向速度与声速或质子热速度一致，而垂直径向方向的速度与解释为阿尔文波动的冠层多普勒线展宽测量的非热运动一致。文章还讨论了离子声波阻尼的兰道阻尼，提出了质子加热率的估算，以及能量转移的相关内容。 <div>
Radio signals propagating via the solar corona and solar wind are significantly affected by compressive waves, impacting the properties of solar bursts as well as sources viewed through the turbulent solar atmosphere. While static fluctuations scatter radio waves elastically, moving, turbulent, or oscillating density irregularities act to broaden the frequency of the scattered waves. Using a new anisotropic density fluctuation model from the kinetic scattering theory for solar radio bursts, we deduce the plasma velocities required to explain observations of spacecraft signal frequency broadening. The inferred velocities are consistent with motions that are dominated by the solar wind at distances ≳10 R⊙, but the levels of frequency broadening for ≲10 R⊙ require additional radial speeds ∼(100–300) km s−1 and/or transverse speeds ∼(20–70) km s−1. The inferred radial velocities also appear consistent with the sound or proton thermal speeds, while the speeds perpendicular to the radial direction are consistent with nonthermal motions measured via coronal Doppler-line broadening, interpreted as Alfvénic fluctuations. Landau damping of parallel propagating ion-sound (slow MHD) waves allows an estimate of the proton heating rate. The energy deposition rates due to ion-sound wave damping peak at a heliocentric distance of ∼(1–3) R⊙ are comparable to the rates available from a turbulent cascade of Alfvénic waves at large scales, suggesting a coherent picture of energy transfer, via the cascade or/and parametric decay of Alfvén waves to the small scales where heating takes place.

<br /><br />总结: 本研究使用Tomo-e Gozen北天移动天体调查的数据，对241个BL Lacertae (BL Lacs)和83个平谱射线类星体(FSRQs)进行了光学变异性研究，平均每个类星体进行了约50次的观测。研究排除了由于宿主星系光度影响而低估光学变异性的类星体。研究发现，γ射线光子指数高于2.6的FSRQs表现出非常低的光学变异性，并且它们的光度标准差分布与其他FSRQs明显不同。在任何特定的宇宙时期，具有较低γ射线光度的类星体往往具有较低的光学变异性。此外，高γ射线光子指数的FSRQs的结构函数振幅显著低于低γ射线光子指数的FSRQs。这表明高γ射线光子指数的FSRQs的光学组分可能受主星系的影响。 <div>
We studied the optical variability of 241 BL Lacertae (BL Lacs) and 83 flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) from the 4LAC catalog using data from the Tomo-e Gozen Northern Sky Transient Survey, with ∼50 epochs per blazar on average. We excluded blazars whose optical variability may be underestimated due to the influence of their host galaxy based on their optical luminosity (LO). FSRQs with γ-ray photon index greater than 2.6 exhibit very low optical variability, and their distribution of standard deviation of repeated photometry is significantly different from that of the other FSRQs (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test p-value equal to 5 × 10−6). Among a sample of blazars at any particular cosmological epoch, those with lower γ-ray luminosity (Lγ) tend to have lower optical variability, and those FSRQs with a γ-ray photon index greater than 2.6 tend to have low Lγ. We also measured the structure function of optical variability and found that the amplitude of the structure function for FSRQs is higher than previously measured and higher than that of BL Lacs at multiple time lags. Additionally, the amplitude of the structure function of FSRQs with high γ-ray photon index is significantly lower than that of FSRQs with low γ-ray photon index. The structure function of FSRQs of high γ-ray photon index shows a characteristic timescale of more than 10 days, which may be the variability timescale of the accretion disk. In summary, we infer that the optical component of FSRQs with high γ-ray photon index may be dominated by the accretion disk.

本文讨论了活动星系核（AGN）的X射线遮挡，提出了大尺度盘风的Compton-thick层可能导致UV吸收和X射线遮挡的观点。通过物理模型和辐射传输计算，展示了扩展的盘风在特定条件下可以与UV/X射线观测一致地产生足够的遮挡现象。研究还预测了UV/X射线相关性，并说明了在这种场景下风的可变空间尺度。 <div>
X-ray obscuration of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is considered in the context of ionized winds of stratified structure launched from accretion disks. We argue that a Compton-thick layer of a large-scale disk wind can obscure continuum X-rays and also lead to broad UV absorption, such as in the blue wing of C iv; the former originates from the inner wind and the latter from the outer wind, as a dual role. Motivated by a number of lines of observational evidence showing strong AGN obscuration phenomena in Seyfert 1 AGNs such as NGC 5548, we demonstrate in this work, by utilizing a physically motivated wind model coupled to post-process radiative transfer calculations, that an extended disk wind under certain physical conditions (e.g., morphology and density) could naturally cause a sufficient obscuration qualitatively consistent with UV/X-ray observations. Predicted UV/X-ray correlation is also presented as a consequence of variable spatial size of the wind in this scenario.

The paper shows the thermodynamic nature of the evolution of the pickup ion (PUI) distributions through their incorporation and subsequent expansion as the solar wind moves outward through the heliosphere. In particular, the PUI expansive cooling is connected to thermodynamic polytropic processes and the thermodynamic kappa parameter. Previously, the characterization of the cooling was phenomenologically given by a “cooling index” α, which is the exponent involved in the power-law relationship between PUI speed and position. Here, we develop the relationship between the cooling and polytropic indices. Then, we show the connection between the cooling index and the thermodynamic parameter kappa. Finally, we verify the derived thermodynamic relations with direct heliospheric observations over varying distances from the Sun. Going forward, we suggest that studies of PUIs seeking to understand the underlying physics of these important particles rely on the thermodynamic parameter of kappa, and its association with the polytropic index, and not on an ad hoc cooling index.

We present the detection of a magnetized dust ring (M0.8–0.2) in the central molecular zone (CMZ) of the Galactic center. The results presented in this paper utilize the first data release of the Far-Infrared Polarimetric Large Area CMZ Emission (FIREPLACE) survey (i.e., Paper I of this series). The FIREPLACE survey is a 214 μm polarimetric survey of the Galactic center using the SOFIA/HAWC+ telescope. The M0.8–0.2 ring is a region of gas and dust that has a circular morphology with a central depression. The dust polarization in the M0.8–0.2 ring implies a curved magnetic field that traces the ring-like structure of the cloud. We posit an interpretation in which an expanding shell compresses and concentrates the ambient gas and magnetic field. We argue that this compression results in strengthening of the magnetic field, as we infer from the observations toward the interior of the ring.

We present the results of an investigation of a highly variable C iv broad absorption line (BAL) feature in spectra of the quasar SBS 1408+544 (z = 2.337) that shows a significant shift in velocity over time. This source was observed as a part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Reverberation Mapping project and the SDSS-V Black Hole Mapper Reverberation Mapping project, and has been included in two previous studies, both of which identified significant variability in a high-velocity C iv BAL on timescales of just a few days in the quasar rest frame. Using ∼130 spectra acquired over 8 yr of spectroscopic monitoring with SDSS, we have determined that this BAL is not only varying in strength, but is also systematically shifting to higher velocities. Using cross-correlation methods, we measure the velocity shifts (and corresponding acceleration) of the BAL over a wide range of timescales, measuring an overall velocity shift of km s−1 over the 8 yr monitoring period. This corresponds to an average rest-frame acceleration of a = 1.04 cm s−2, though the magnitude of the acceleration on shorter timescales is not constant throughout. We place our measurements in the context of BAL-acceleration models and examine various possible causes of the observed velocity shift.

这篇文章研究了类型1活动星系核的环状结构大小和亮度的关系，采用了光学和红外光度的反演测量分析结果。研究结果表明，环的大小与观测到的尘埃辐射波长有关，且烧尽盘污染的修正后的瓦特-梅德星系核辐射和环的关系比预期的要浅。此外，研究还发现环大小和Eddington比之间存在中等程度的相关性，表明Eddington比可能对观测到的环-辐射关系的扁平化产生影响。
<br /><br />总结: AGNs, torus size, reverberation-mapping analysis, bolometric luminosity, WISE survey
<br />类型1活动星系核环大小与亮度关系的研究采用反演测量分析，并根据瓦特-梅德星系核的W1和W2波段光度测得450多个AGNs样本，覆盖了从1043.4到1047.6 erg s−1的大动态范围的辐射亮度。结果显示环的大小与观测到的尘埃辐射波长有关，并发现环大小与Eddington比之间存在中等程度的相关性。 <div>
We investigate the torus size–luminosity relation of Type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) based on the reverberation-mapping analysis using the light curves of the optical continuum and the IR continuum obtained with the W1 and W2 bands of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer survey. The final sample consists of 446 and 416 AGNs, respectively, for W1- and W2-band light curves, covering a large dynamic range of bolometric luminosity from 1043.4 to 1047.6 erg s−1, which show reliable lag measurements based on our quality assessment analysis. After correcting for the accretion disk contamination in the observed IR flux, we constrain the torus size (Rdust) and AGN bolometric luminosity (Lbol) relationship with the best-fit slope of 0.39 (0.33) for the W1 (W2) band, which is shallower than expected from the dust radiation equilibrium model. By combining the previous K-band lag measurements, we find that the measured torus size depends on the observed wavelength of the dust radiation, as Rdust,K: Rdust,W1: Rdust,W2 = 1.0:1.5:1.8 (Rdust ∝ λ0.80) at Lbol = 1046 erg s−1, confirming a stratified structure of the torus, where wavelength-dependent emissions originate from distinct regions of the torus. By investigating the deviation from the best-fit torus size–luminosity relation, we find a moderate correlation between the offset from the Rdust–Lbol relation and Eddington ratio. This suggests a possible influence of the Eddington ratio on the observed flattening of the Rdust–Lbol relationship.

在这篇论文中，作者使用一个名为ngehtsim的新工具来探索高频VLBI观测的限制。他们使用历史大气模型来模拟观测条件，并通过启发式能见度检测标准来模拟单频和多频VLBI校准策略。作者展示了ngehtsim的预测的准确性，并通过与EHT现有的230 GHz数据的对比来验证其方法。在345 GHz的观测中，预测到EHT的性能会大大降低，M87*的观测可能达不到成像的水平，预计检测率约为20%。通过扩大带宽和/或延长积分时间来提高阵列灵敏度，例如，下一代EHT设想的同时多频升级，可以改善345 GHz的观测前景，并获得与230 GHz相媲美的检测水平。在460 GHz的大气窗口中进行的M87*和Sgr A*观测可能会在长基线上定期获得多次检测，但在690和875 GHz进行的类似观测几乎完全没有检测到。 <br /><br />总结: 高频VLBI观测的限制是由于大气噪声增加导致的灵敏度下降，模拟结果表明，在345 GHz的观测中，EHT的性能可能大大降低，但通过提高阵列灵敏度和观测技术升级，未来仍有望提高观测前景。 <div>
Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) provides the highest-resolution images in astronomy. The sharpest resolution is nominally achieved at the highest frequencies, but as the observing frequency increases, so too does the atmospheric contribution to the system noise, degrading the sensitivity of the array and hampering detection. In this paper, we explore the limits of high-frequency VLBI observations using ngehtsim, a new tool for generating realistic synthetic data. ngehtsim uses detailed historical atmospheric models to simulate observing conditions, and it employs heuristic visibility detection criteria that emulate single- and multifrequency VLBI calibration strategies. We demonstrate the fidelity of ngehtsim’s predictions using a comparison with existing 230 GHz data taken by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), and we simulate the expected performance of EHT observations at 345 GHz. Though the EHT achieves a nearly 100% detection rate at 230 GHz, our simulations indicate that it should expect substantially poorer performance at 345 GHz; in particular, observations of M87* at 345 GHz are predicted to achieve detection rates of ≲20% that may preclude imaging. Increasing the array sensitivity through wider bandwidths and/or longer integration times—as enabled through, e.g., the simultaneous multifrequency upgrades envisioned for the next-generation EHT—can improve the 345 GHz prospects and yield detection levels that are comparable to those at 230 GHz. M87* and Sgr A* observations carried out in the atmospheric window around 460 GHz could expect to regularly achieve multiple detections on long baselines, but analogous observations at 690 and 875 GHz consistently obtain almost no detections at all.

We developed a grid of stellar rotation models for low-mass and solar-type classical T Tauri stars (CTTS; 0.3M⊙ < M* < 1.2M⊙). These models incorporate the star–disk interaction and magnetospheric ejections to investigate the evolution of the stellar rotation rate as a function of the mass of the star M*, the magnetic field (B*), and stellar wind ( ). We compiled and determined stellar parameters for 208 CTTS, such as projected rotational velocity , mass accretion rate , stellar mass M*, ages, and estimated rotational periods using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data. We also estimated a representative value of the mass-loss rate for our sample using the [O i] λ 6300 spectral line. Our results confirm that measurements in CTTS agree with the rotation rates provided by our spin models in the accretion-powered stellar winds picture. In addition, we used the approximate Bayesian computation technique to explore the connection between the model parameters and the observational properties of CTTS. We find that the evolution of with age might be regulated by variations in (1) the intensity of B* and (2) the fraction of the accretion flow ejected in magnetic winds, removing angular momentum from these systems. The youngest stars in our sample (∼1 Myr) show a median branching ratio and median B* ∼ 2000 G, in contrast to ∼0.01 and 1000 G, respectively, for stars with ages ≳3 Myr.

总结: 
PSR J1849-0001和其脉冲星风星云(PSR J1849-000)与TeV源HESS J1849-000重合。研究通过分析新旧CXO数据，解析了脉冲星和PWN，探索了PWN的形态并测量了不同区域的光谱。脉冲星和内部PWN的光谱均呈硬态。PWN具有相对较低的亮度，缺乏γ射线脉冲，观测结果表明脉冲星的自旋和磁偶极轴之间的角度较小，与一些MeV脉冲星具有相似特性。尽管联合X射线和TeV能谱的单一区模型可以描述，但得到的磁场值不切实际，更合理的场景是存在一个遗迹星风星云，不再通过同步辐射发出X射线，但仍通过逆Compton散射在TeV波段辐射。此外，还偶然检测到一个非常明亮的广泛双星X射线辐射。 <br /><br /> <div>
We obtained a 108 ks Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) observation of PSR J1849-0001 and its pulsar wind nebula (PWN) coincident with the TeV source HESS J1849-000. By analyzing the new and old (archival) CXO data, we resolved the pulsar from the PWN, explored the PWN morphology on arcsecond and arcminute scales, and measured the spectra of different regions of the PWN. Both the pulsar and the compact inner PWN spectra are hard with power-law photon indices of 1.20 ± 0.07 and 1.49 ± 0.20, respectively. The jet-dominated PWN has a relatively low luminosity, lack of γ-ray pulsations, relatively hard and nonthermal spectrum of the pulsar, and sine-like pulse profile, which indicates a relatively small angle between the pulsar’s spin and magnetic dipole axis. In this respect, it shares similar properties with a few other so-called MeV pulsars. Although the joint X-ray and TeV spectral energy distribution can be roughly described by a single-zone model, the obtained magnetic field value is unrealistically low. A more realistic scenario is the presence of a relic PWN, no longer emitting synchrotron X-rays but still radiating in TeV via inverse-Compton upscattering. We also serendipitously detected surprisingly bright X-ray emission from a very wide binary whose components should not be interacting.

<div> 关键词: kilonova, neutron star merger, opacities, lanthanides, bolometric luminosity
总结:<br /><br />本研究通过推导离子化至V-XI态的La至Ra元素（Z = 57-88）的原子不透明度，研究了中子星合并早期（t < 1天）的kilonova现象。结果显示，具有开放f-壳层的元素的高温下光学厚度异常高，而相同温度和波长下具有开放d-、p-和s-壳层的元素的光学厚度分别为0.1和0.01 cm2 g−1。研究发现，富含镧系元素的喷射物的全波段光度显示出明显的特征，并且比不含镧系元素的喷射物要暗淡。早期光度受薄外层存在的影响而受到抑制。研究还指出，能够复制有或无镧系元素的全波段光曲线的灰色不透明度分别为1-10和0.8 cm2 g−1。研究结果表明，这样的kilonova现象是未来紫外卫星和巡天项目的理想观测目标。 <div>
We investigate early (t < 1 day) kilonova from a neutron star merger by deriving atomic opacities for all the elements from La to Ra (Z = 57–88) ionized to the states V–XI. The opacities at high temperatures for the elements with open f-shells (e.g., lanthanides) are exceptionally high, reaching at λ ≤ 1000 Å at T ∼ 70,000 K, whereas the opacities at the same temperature and wavelengths for the elements with open d-, p-, and s-shells reach , 0.1, and 0.01 cm2 g−1, respectively. Using the new opacity data set, we derive early kilonovae for various compositions and density structures expected for neutron star merger ejecta. The bolometric luminosity of the lanthanide-rich ejecta shows distinct signatures and is fainter than that of the lanthanide-free ejecta. Early luminosity is suppressed by the presence of a thin outer layer, agreeing with the results of Kasen et al. and Banerjee et al. The early brightness in the Swift UVOT filters and in the optical g, r, i, and z filters for a source at 100 Mpc are about ∼22–19.5 and ∼21–20 mag, respectively, at t ∼ 0.1 day. Such kilonovae are ideal targets for the upcoming UV satellites, such as ULTRASAT, UVEX, and DORADO, and the upcoming surveys, e.g., the Vera Rubin Observatory. We suggest that the gray opacities that reproduce the bolometric light curves with and without lanthanides are ∼1–10 and ∼0.8 cm2 g−1.

The principal regular satellites of gas giants are thought to be formed by the accumulation of solid materials in circumplanetary disks (CPDs). While there has been significant progress in the study of satellite formation in CPDs, details of the supply of satellite building blocks to CPDs remain unclear. We perform the orbital integration of solid particles in the protoplanetary disk (PPD) approaching a planet, considering the gas drag force by using the results of three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a local region around the planet. We investigate the planetary mass dependence of the capture positions and the capture rates of dust particles accreting onto the CPD. We also examine the degree of dust retention in the accreting gas onto the CPD, which is important for determining the ratio of the dust-to-gas inflow rates, a key parameter in satellite formation. We find that the degree of dust retention increases with increasing planetary mass for a given dust scale height in the PPD. In the case of a small planet (Mp = 0.2MJup), most particles with insufficient initial altitudes in the PPD are isolated from the gas in the accreting region. On the other hand, in the case of a massive planet (Mp = 1MJup), dust particles can be coupled to the vertically accreting gas, even when the dust scale height is about 10%–30% of the gas scale height. The results of this study can be used for models of dust delivery and satellite formation in the CPDs of gas giants of various masses, including exoplanets.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了对于理解活跃星系核等系统中的外流和吸积盘至关重要的辐射力的定量描述。研究提供了计算AGN环境中无因次谱线力乘数的范例，并明确计算了在吸积盘上方提议的风向区域的光电离平衡，计算了气体的谱线驱动力的强度，并重新确定并形式化了常用的电离参量ξ在最终确定谱线驱动力中的作用。研究表明，虽然电离参量很有用，但它并不能完全描述外流材料的整体电离状态。文章提出了一种使用X射线光谱指数ΓX和电离参量计算辐射线驱动力强度的更新方法。 <div>
Flows driven by photons have been studied for almost a century, and a quantitative description of the radiative forces on atoms and ions is important for understanding a wide variety of systems with outflows and accretion disks, such as active galactic nuclei (AGN). Quantifying the associated forces is crucial to determining how these outflows enable interactive mechanisms within these environments, such as AGN feedback. The total number of spectral lines in any given ion of the outflow material must be tabulated in order to give a complete characterization of this force. Here, we provide calculations of the dimensionless line force multiplier for AGN environments. For a wide array of representative AGN sources, we explicitly calculate the photoionization balance at the proposed wind-launching region above the accretion disk, compute the strength of the line-driving force on the gas, and revisit and formalize the role of the commonly used ionization parameter ξ in ultimately determining the line-driving force. We perform these computations and analyses for a variety of AGN central source properties, such as black hole mass, initial wind velocity, and number density. We find that, while useful, the ionization parameter provides an incomplete description of the overall ionization state of the outflow material. We use these findings to provide an updated method for calculating the strength of the radiative line-driving using both the X-ray spectral index ΓX and the ionization parameter.

<title>Polarization Properties of 128 Nonrepeating Fast Radio Bursts from the First CHIME/FRB Baseband Catalog</title>

FRB观测研究了128个非重复快速射电暴的偏振特性，发现89个具有线偏振检测，29个无线偏振，10个受到仪器偏振的影响；对于线偏振的FRB，发现RM在0.5–1160 rad m−2范围内，大部分与银河系类似；FRB的偏振位置角分为四种类型；未发现整体频率相关消偏振的证据，因此线偏振分布差异可能源于FRB的发射机制；提出了一种新方法用于判断偏振FRB的红移下限。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
We present a 400–800 MHz polarimetric analysis of 128 nonrepeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) from the first CHIME/FRB baseband catalog, increasing the total number of FRB sources with polarization properties by a factor of ∼3. A total of 89 FRBs have >6σ linearly polarized detections, 29 FRBs fall below this significance threshold and are deemed linearly unpolarized, and for 10 FRBs, the polarization data are contaminated by instrumental polarization. For the 89 polarized FRBs, we find Faraday rotation measure (RM) amplitudes, after subtracting approximate Milky Way contributions, in the range 0.5–1160 rad m−2 with a median of 53.8 rad m−2. Most nonrepeating FRBs in our sample have RMs consistent with Milky Way–like host galaxies, and their linear polarization fractions range from ≤10% to 100% with a median of 63%. We see marginal evidence that nonrepeating FRBs have more constraining lower limits than repeating FRBs for the host electron-density-weighted line of sight magnetic field strength. We classify the nonrepeating FRB polarization position angle (PA) profiles into four archetypes: (i) single component with constant PA (57% of the sample), (ii) single component with variable PA (10%), (iii) multiple components with a single-constant PA (22%), and (iv) multiple components with different or variable PAs (11%). We see no evidence for population-wide frequency-dependent depolarization, and, therefore, the spread in the distribution of fractional linear polarization is likely intrinsic to the FRB emission mechanism. Finally, we present a novel method to derive redshift lower limits for polarized FRBs without host galaxy identification and test this method on 20 FRBs with independently measured redshifts.

这篇文章研究了位于银河系中太阳金属丰度地区的Wolf–Rayet星[KSF2015] 1381-19L。作者使用CMFGEN对光学和近红外波段观测到的光谱发射线进行拟合，详细表征了恒星大气。最佳拟合的光谱模型表明，这颗恒星是一个高光度（105.89L⊙）、半径较大（15 R⊙）的恒星，其有效温度、风速末端速度和化学组成与银河系WC9-dusty（WC9d）型恒星相似。大气电离结构显示不同元素的共存电离态，同时影响着光学厚度和热电子平衡。光谱能量数据拟合表明存在高的星际光学消光（AV = 8.87），而红外消光则相对较低。作者未在近红外波长检测到由尘埃引起的过量辐射。通过与GENEVA单星演化模型（Z = 0.014）的比较，作者确定了最可能的祖先星（一个质量为67 M⊙的自转星和一个质量为90 M⊙的不自转星）。<br /><br />总结: 这项研究通过多波段观测对Wolf–Rayet星进行了详细研究，揭示了其大气特性和星际尘埃消光。研究结果有助于对恒星演化和宇宙化学的理解。 <div>
We report on a multiwavelength study of the Wolf–Rayet star [KSF2015] 1381-19L, which is located in the solar metallicity region (Z = 0.014) of the Milky Way, strongly obscured by interstellar dust. We perform a detailed characterization of the stellar atmosphere by fitting the spectral emission lines observed in the optical and near-infrared (NIR) bands, using CMFGEN. The best-fitted spectroscopic model indicates a highly luminous (105.89L⊙) star with a large radius (15 R⊙) and effective temperature, wind terminal velocity, and chemical composition similar to those of Galactic WC9-dusty (WC9d)-type stars. The atmospheric ionization structure shows coexisting ionization states of different elements, simultaneously affecting the opacity and thermal electron balance. Fitting of the spectral energy data reveals high interstellar optical extinction (AV = 8.87), while the IR extinction is found to be comparatively lower ( ). We do not detect any excess emission at NIR wavelengths due to dust. Upon comparison of our results with the GENEVA single-star evolutionary models (Z = 0.014), we identify the best possible progenitors (a rotating star of 67 M⊙ and a nonrotating star of 90 M⊙).

5. 研究结论对了解太阳辐射压力对中性氢原子运动和探测器测量的影响具有重要意义。 <div>
Radiation pressure exerted by solar photon output is salient to the motion of primary neutral hydrogen atoms streaming into the inner heliosphere directly from the local interstellar medium. The action of a time-dependent radiation pressure force, when coupled with the usual gravitational force, changes the characteristic velocities, and therefore energies, of the atoms when they reach regions in which explorer probes are present. A study is presented that uses a 2D code to backtrace neutral hydrogen trajectories from representative target points located 1 au from the Sun. It makes use of both a radiation pressure function and a function for the photoionization rate at 1 au that both oscillate with time based on measurements over a typical solar cycle, as well as a time-independent charge exchange ionization rate at 1 au. Assuming a Maxwellian distribution in the distant upwind direction, phase space data is calculated at the target points, at different moments in time. The dependence of the force on the radial particle velocity has been omitted in the analysis, such that the emphasis is on the effects of the global solar UV intensity variations through the solar cycle. This process allows for the analysis of direct and indirect Maxwellian components through time and space in the time-dependent force environment. Additionally, pseudo-bound orbits caused by energy losses associated with this force environment are observed, and their properties are evaluated with the aim of determining their effects on potential measurements by explorer probes.

<div> TDEs, super-Eddington accretion, slim-disk model, radiation-driven disk wind, Cloudy modeling<br /> 

总结:<br />本文探讨了来自潮汐破坏事件形成的包层的演化，通过解决slim-disk模型的全局解。我们的模型能大致再现TDEs的典型温度、亮度和光球大小。通过Cloudy建模，我们发现仅考虑辐射驱动的盘风时，发射线亮度通常远低于典型的观测结果，这是由于包层外部的有限大气层质量所致。我们提出了通过星体碎片围绕过程中的自碰撞所产生的喷流推出盘风光球外部足够的物质。我们计算的光谱能够大致再现几种典型发射线（如Hα，Hβ和He ii）的主要性质，这在TDE候选AT2018dyb上得到了很好的应用。 <div>
The theoretical debris supply rate from a tidal disruption of stars can exceed about 100 times of Eddington accretion rate for a 106−7M⊙ supermassive black hole. It is believed that a strong wind will be launched from the disk surface due to the radiation pressure in the case of super-Eddington accretion, which may be one of the mechanisms for the formation of the envelope, as observed in tidal disruption events (TDEs). In this work, we explore the evolution of the envelope that formed from the optical thick winds by solving the global solution of the slim-disk model. Our model can roughly reproduce the typical temperature, luminosity, and size of the photosphere for TDEs. Based on Cloudy modeling, we find that, if only considering the radiation-driven disk wind, the emission line luminosities are normally much lower than the typical observational results, due to the limited atmosphere mass outside the envelope. We propose that the ejection of the outflow from the self-collision of the stellar debris during the circularization may provide enough matter outside the disk-wind photosphere. Our calculated spectra can roughly reproduce the main properties of several typical emission lines (e.g., Hα, Hβ, and He ii), which was applied well to a TDE candidate AT2018dyb.

<title>An Expanded Set of Los Alamos OPLIB Tables in MESA: Type-1 Rosseland-mean Opacities and Solar Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a set of 1194 Type-1 Rosseland-mean opacity tables for four different metallicity mixtures. These new Los Alamos OPLIB atomic radiative opacity tables are an order of magnitude larger in number than any previous opacity table release, and span regimes where previous opacity tables have not existed. For example, the new set of opacity tables expands the metallicity range to Z = 10−6 to Z = 0.2, which allows improved accuracy of opacities at low and high metallicity, increases the table density in the metallicity range Z = 10−4 to Z = 0.1 to enhance the accuracy of opacities drawn from interpolations across neighboring metallicities, and adds entries for hydrogen mass fractions between X = 0 and X = 0.1 including X = 10−2, 10−3, 10−4, 10−5, 10−6 that can improve stellar models of hydrogen deficient stars. We implement these new OPLIB radiative opacity tables in MESA and find that calibrated solar models agree broadly with previously published helioseismic and solar neutrino results. We find differences between using the new 1194 OPLIB opacity tables and the 126 OPAL opacity tables range from ≈20% to 80% across individual chemical mixtures, up to ≈8% and ≈15% at the bottom and top of the solar convection zone respectively, and ≈7% in the solar core. We also find differences between standard solar models using different opacity table sources that are on par with altering the initial abundance mixture. We conclude that this new, open-access set of OPLIB opacity tables does not solve the solar modeling problem, and suggest the investigation of physical mechanisms other than the atomic radiative opacity.

<title>Spectropolarimetric Radio Imaging of Faint Gyrosynchrotron Emission from a CME: A Possible Indication of the Insufficiency of Homogeneous Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The geo-effectiveness of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is determined primarily by their magnetic fields. Modeling of gyrosynchrotron (GS) emission is a promising remote sensing technique to measure the CME magnetic field at coronal heights. However, faint GS emission from CME flux ropes is hard to detect in the presence of bright solar emission from the solar corona. With high dynamic-range spectropolarimetric meter wavelength solar images provided by the Murchison Widefield Array, we have detected faint GS emission from a CME out to ∼8.3 R⊙, the largest heliocentric distance reported to date. High-fidelity polarimetric calibration also allowed us to robustly detect circularly polarized emission from GS emission. For the first time in the literature, Stokes V detection has jointly been used with Stokes I spectra to constrain GS models. One expects that the inclusion of polarimetric measurement will provide tighter constraints on the GS model parameters. Instead, we found that homogeneous GS models, which have been used in all prior works, are unable to model both the total intensity and circular polarized emission simultaneously. This strongly suggests the need for using inhomogeneous GS models to robustly estimate the CME magnetic field and plasma parameters.

<title>Equator to Pole Solar Chromospheric Differential Rotation Using Ca-K Features Derived from Kodaikanal Data</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Differential rotation is one of the basic characteristics of the Sun, and it plays an important role in generating the magnetic fields and its activities. We investigated rotation rate using chromospheric features such as plages, enhanced network (EN), active network (AN), and quiet network (QN) separately (for the first time). The digitized Ca-K images from Kodaikanal Observatory for 1907–1996 are used to study rotation over 0°–80° latitudes at an interval of 10°. We find that plages and all types of networks exhibit the differential rotation of the chromosphere. Furthermore, the rotation rate shows a decreasing pattern as one move from the equator to the higher polar latitudes for all the features used in the study. At the equator the rotation rate (rotation period) is obtained to be ∼13.98° day−1 (25.74 days), ∼13.91° day−1 (25.88 days), ∼13.99° day−1 (25.74 days), and ∼14.11° day−1 (25.51 days) for plage, EN, AN, and QN areas, respectively. By analyzing how the area of chromospheric features varies over time, we can effectively map the Sun’s rotation rate at all latitudes, including the polar regions. Interestingly, both plages and small-scale networks exhibit a similar differential rotation rate. This suggests these features likely rooted at the same layer below the visible surface of the Sun. Therefore, the long-term Ca-K data is very useful for studying the solar rotation rate at all latitudes including the polar regions.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
HD 327083 is a binary system that consists of two supergiant components and exhibits the B[e] phenomenon. In this paper, we report the determination of a new set of the system’s fundamental parameters using a combination of photometric and spectroscopic data as well as the Gaia EDR3 distance. We found that the orbital period of the system is 107.68 ± 0.02 days. The spectral line content implies the effective temperatures of ≈7000 K and 25,400 ± 1400 K, while the photometric variations are consistent with the radii of ≈106 R⊙ and ≈10 R⊙ for the cool and hot components, respectively. The absorption lines of the cool component show a radial velocity semiamplitude of 48.3 ± 1.7 km s−1, similar to that of the emission lines that originate around the hot component. The inclination of the system to the line of sight is °. Modeling of the system's evolutionary history suggests that the components have masses of ∼12.5 M⊙ and currently undergo mass transfer between them. This configuration, which takes in heating of the surface of the cool component by the radiation from the hot one, can reproduce the photometric and spectroscopic data and is in agreement with previous infrared observations of the circumbinary disk. The results of this study further confirm the hypothesis that the reason for the presence of the B[e] phenomenon in most objects is a consequence of the evolution of various binary systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present two simultaneous NICER and NuSTAR observations of the ultracompact X-ray binary (UCXB) candidate SLX 1735−269 while the source was in two different spectral states. Using various reflection modeling techniques, we find that xillverCO, a model used for fitting X-ray spectra of UCXBs with high carbon and oxygen abundances is an improvement over relxill or relxillNS, which instead contains solar-like chemical abundances. This provides indirect evidence in support of the source being ultracompact. We also use this reflection model to get a preliminary measurement of the inclination of the system, degrees. This is consistent with our timing analysis, where a lack of eclipses indicates an inclination of i < 80°. The timing analysis is otherwise inconclusive, and we cannot confidently measure the orbital period of the system.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a detailed study of cool-core systems in a sample of four galaxy clusters (RXCJ1504.1-0248, A3112, A4059, and A478) using archival X-ray data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Cool cores are frequently observed at the centers of galaxy clusters and are considered to be formed by radiative cooling of the intracluster medium (ICM). Cool cores are characterized by a significant drop in the ICM temperature toward the cluster center. We extract and analyze X-ray spectra of the ICM to measure the radial profiles of the ICM thermodynamic properties, including temperature, density, pressure, entropy, and radiative cooling time. We define the cool-core radius as the turnover radius in the ICM temperature profile and investigate the relation between the cool-core radius and the properties of the host galaxy clusters. In our sample, we observe that the radiative cooling time of the ICM at the cool-core radius exceeds 10 Gyr, with RXCJ1504.1-0248 exhibiting a radiative cooling time of Gyr at its cool-core radius. These results indicate that not only radiative cooling but also additional mechanisms, such as gas sloshing, may play an important role in determining the size of cool cores. Additionally, we might find that the best-fit relation between the cool-core radius and the cluster mass (M500) is consistent with a linear relation. Our findings may suggest that cool cores are linked to the evolution of their host galaxy clusters.

<div> Maunder Minimum, solar activity, sunspot, observers, transition
<br /><br />总结:  Maunder Minimum是一个太阳活动显著降低的时期，这项研究对此进行了重新审视。研究中发现，对于这一时期的太阳活动水平存在差异。通过重新统计太阳黑子观测数据，发现了对于1716年至1726年太阳活动的错误解读。研究还发现，通过主动日分数方法获取的太阳活动数值明显低于官方太阳黑子观测值，但与放射性同位素等太阳活动代理数值一致。这一研究结果表明，Maunder Minimum后太阳活动的恢复过程比之前认为的更为缓慢且强度较低。 <div>
The Maunder Minimum was a period with significantly reduced solar activity between 1645 and 1715, approximately. The transition between the low solar activity in the Maunder Minimum and the subsequent “normal” regime of solar activity was gradual. However, there are discrepancies in the solar activity level from sunspot number indices and solar activity proxies in that period. Among the contemporaneous observers, Johann L. Rost and Sebastian Alischer were two key sunspot observers to understand the solar activity in this transition just after the Maunder Minimum. We have revised all their sunspot records, counting the number of groups and individual sunspots to derive reliable data for the solar activity level for the period 1716–1726. We found significant misinterpretations of the sunspot group counting assigned to these astronomers in the existing group number databases. Our new group sunspot counting significantly reduces the number of groups for Rost and Alischer’s observations compared to entries in existing databases. Furthermore, our sunspot number estimates (obtained from the active day fraction methodology) of the maximum amplitude of Solar Cycles −3 and −4 are significantly lower than the amplitudes according to the official sunspot number, but they are compatible with sunspot number values obtained from solar activity proxies such as radioisotopes. Our result would imply that solar activity after the Maunder Minimum recovered more gradually and with a lower intensity than previously considered.

总结:<br />
本研究分析了Chandra X射线望远镜对NGC 4945星系进行的观测，研究了星系中心热气体的性质以及其质量流出率。研究发现，热气体的温度和数密度在星系中心最大，沿着流出区逐渐减小，这和球对称且绝热膨胀的风模型不一致，暗示了需要考虑质量加载和/或非球对称的外流几何形状。研究估计热风的质量流出率约为每年1.6太阳质量。在北部流出区检测到了来自电荷交换的辐射，估计其贡献了约12%的X射线流量。 <div>
We analyze 330 ks of Chandra X-ray imaging and spectra of the nearby, edge-on starburst and Seyfert type 2 galaxy NGC 4945 to measure the hot gas properties along the galactic outflows. We extract and model spectra from 15 regions extending from −0.55 to +0.85 kpc above and below the galactic disk to determine the best-fit parameters and metal abundances. We find that the hot gas temperatures and number densities peak in the central regions and decrease along the outflows. These profiles are inconsistent with a spherical, adiabatically expanding wind model, suggesting the need to include mass loading and/or a nonspherical outflow geometry. We estimate the mass outflow rate of the hot wind to be 1.6 M⊙ yr−1. Emission from charge exchange is detected in the northern outflow, and we estimate it contributes 12% to the emitted, broadband (0.5–7 keV) X-ray flux.

<div> Fermi, All-sky, Variability Analysis, Galactic gamma-ray flares, pulsars  
总结：<br /><br />这项研究使用Fermi All-sky Variability Analysis对779周的Fermi大面积望远镜数据进行分析，估计在银河系中的γ射线闪烁的发生率，并寻找新的变化的γ射线暂现象。研究发现每年大约有8.5个银河γ射线闪烁事件发生，其中有大约1个来自未知来源。此外，研究还发现了六个新的γ射线暂现现象，这些现象可能是脉冲星或未知性质的天体，它们在空间位置上与已知的超新星遗迹或脉冲星星风星雾重叠。此外，研究还发现了九次不太可能来自已知γ射线源的未关联的闪烁事件。 <div>
The Fermi All-sky Variability Analysis (FAVA) provides a photometric alternative for identifying week-long gamma-ray flares across the entire sky while being independent of any diffuse Galactic or isotropic emission model. We reviewed 779 weeks of Fermi Large Area Telescope data analyzed by FAVA to estimate the rate and origin of Galactic gamma-ray flares, and to search for new variable Galactic gamma-ray transients. We report an estimated yearly rate of ∼8.5 Galactic gamma-ray flares yr–1, with ∼1 flare yr–1 coming from unknown sources. Out of the known gamma-ray sources that are spatially coincident with these detected flares, we report gamma-ray flares for six of them for the first time. All six are classified as pulsars, or a source of unknown nature but which positionally overlaps with known supernova remnants or pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). This potentially means these sites are tentative candidates to be the second known site of a variable gamma-ray PWN, after the famous Crab Nebula’s PWN. Additionally, we identify nine unassociated flares that are unlikely to have originated from known gamma-ray sources.

<div> FAST, THINGS, diffuse H i, tidal interactions, rotational motion
总结:<br /><br />这项统计研究对比了通过FAST（FEASTS program）和干涉仪 Very Large Array（THINGS program）探测到的10个邻近星系中弥散H i的性质。THINGS观测由于干涉仪的短基线问题和有限的灵敏度，平均错过了23%的H i。研究提取了通过THINGS数据和统一流量密度阈值获得的密集H i，然后从FAST探测到的总H i中减去，得到了弥散H i。在样本中，弥散H i的中值比例为34％，在展现更显著潮汐相互作用迹象的星系中发现了更多的弥散H i。我们发现的弥散H i似乎分布在典型厚度为1 kpc的盘状层内，与之前的研究中发现的NGC 4631周围更类似于halo的弥散H i。大部分弥散H i与密集H i 在空间上重合，并具有1017.7–1020.1 cm−2的典型柱密度。弥散和密集的H i表现出类似的旋转运动，但弥散H i至少在内部盘中落后中值25％，并且其速度离散通常是密集H i的两倍。根据环星系介质性质的简化估算并假设压力平衡，弥散H i的体积密度在每个星系内似乎保持恒定，这暗示了其作为冷却界面的作用。与现有模型相比，这些结果与潮汐相互作用、弥散H i的形成和气体吸积之间可能存在的联系是一致的。 <div>
We present a statistical study of the properties of diffuse H i in 10 nearby galaxies, comparing the H i detected by the single-dish telescope FAST (FEASTS program) and the interferometer Very Large Array (THINGS program), respectively. The THINGS observation missed H i with a median of 23% due to the short-spacing problem of interferometry and limited sensitivity. We extract the diffuse H i by subtracting the dense H i, which is obtained from the THINGS data with a uniform flux-density threshold, from the total H i detected by FAST. Among the sample, the median diffuse-H i fraction is 34%, and more diffuse H i is found in galaxies exhibiting more prominent tidal-interaction signatures. The diffuse H i we detected seems to be distributed in disk-like layers within a typical thickness of 1 kpc, different from the more halo-like diffuse H i detected around NGC 4631 in a previous study. Most of the diffuse H i is cospatial with the dense H i and has a typical column density of 1017.7–1020.1 cm−2. The diffuse and dense H i exhibit a similar rotational motion, but the former lags by a median of 25% in at least the inner disks, and its velocity dispersions are typically twice as high. Based on a simplified estimation of circumgalactic medium properties and assuming pressure equilibrium, the volume density of diffuse H i appears to be constant within each individual galaxy, implying its role as a cooling interface. Comparing with existing models, these results are consistent with a possible link between tidal interactions, the formation of diffuse H i, and gas accretion.

<div> Modified Newtonian dynamics, MOND, breakdown, Newton's laws, gravity, dark matter

总结: 本文介绍了MOND假设在太阳系中的测试，研究结果表明，在使用Bekenstein-Milgrom AQUAL公式进行模拟时，MOND无法解释来自地球可探测到的长周期和奥尔特云彗星的结合能分布。这个结论经过了多种变化的检验，包括行星的迁移历史、太阳的迁移历史、AQUAL的转换函数、太阳出生星团的影响以及长周期彗星的褪色特性。此外，对于AQUAL的最受欢迎版本而言，我们的MOND模拟也无法再现逆行盘中外天王星以外天体的轨道分布（近日点 q > 38 au）。因此，这些结果并不排除一些比AQUAL更为复杂的MOND理论，其中非牛顿效应在小空间尺度、小质量或与临界加速度相当的外部引力场中被屏蔽。 <div>
Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND), which postulates a breakdown of Newton's laws of gravity/dynamics below some critical acceleration threshold, can explain many otherwise puzzling observational phenomena on galactic scales. MOND competes with the hypothesis of dark matter, which successfully explains the cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure. Here we provide the first solar system test of MOND that probes the subcritical acceleration regime. Using the Bekenstein–Milgrom “aquadratic Lagrangian” (or AQUAL) formulation, we simulate the evolution of myriads of test particles (planetesimals or comets) born in the trans-Neptunian region and scattered by the giant planets over the lifetime of the Sun to heliocentric distances of 102–105 au. We include the effects of the Galactic tidal field and passing stars. While Newtonian simulations reproduce the distribution of binding energies of long-period and Oort-cloud comets detectable from Earth, MOND-based simulations do not. This conclusion is robust to plausible changes in the migration history of the planets, the migration history of the Sun, the MOND transition function, effects of the Sun's birth cluster, and the fading properties of long-period comets. For the most popular version of AQUAL, characterized by a gradual transition between the Newtonian and MOND regimes, our MOND-based simulations also fail to reproduce the orbital distribution of trans-Neptunian objects in the detached disk (perihelion q > 38 au). Our results do not rule out some MOND theories more elaborate than AQUAL, in which non-Newtonian effects are screened on small spatial scales, at small masses, or in external gravitational fields comparable in strength to the critical acceleration.

<div> 关键词: sub-GeV dark matter, Milky Way, cosmic-ray fluxes, annihilation, XMM-Newton
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了亚GeV暗物质粒子，可能通过湮灭或衰变产生在银河系中留下痕迹的光子和宇宙射线流量。特别是，暗物质粒子可能会湮灭或衰变成e+e−、μ+μ−或π+π−，并通过它们的e±产生光子辐射。得出的e±产品可以在探测器中直接观察到，例如Voyager 1号。另外，e±产品可能会产生布伦喷射辐射并通过逆康普顿过程向低能银河光子场进行反散射，产生从X射线到γ射线能量的广泛辐射，可在XMM-Newton等实验中观测到。研究发现，包括最佳CR传播和扩散参数后，从XMM-Newton获得了对DM湮灭和衰变的显著改进限制。这对于1 MeV到几GeV范围内的DM质量来说是最强大的天体物理限制，并且甚至在各种质量上超过了宇宙学限制。 <div>
We study sub-GeV dark matter (DM) particles that may annihilate or decay into Standard Model particles producing an exotic injection component in the Milky Way that leaves an imprint in both photon and cosmic-ray (CR) fluxes. Specifically, the DM particles may annihilate or decay into e+e−, μ+μ−, or π+π− and may radiate photons through their e± products. The resulting e± products can be directly observed in probes such as Voyager 1. Alternatively, the e± products may produce bremsstrahlung radiation and upscatter the low-energy Galactic photon fields via the inverse Compton process, generating a broad emission from X-ray to γ-ray energies observable in experiments such as XMM-Newton. We find that we get a significant improvement in the DM annihilation and decay constraints from XMM-Newton (excluding thermally averaged cross sections of 10−31 cm3 s−1 ≲ 〈σv〉 ≲ 10−26 cm3 s−1 and decay lifetimes of 1026 s ≲ τ ≲ 1028 s, respectively) by including best-fit CR propagation and diffusion parameters. This yields the strongest astrophysical constraints for this mass range of DM of 1 MeV to a few GeV and even surpasses cosmological bounds across a wide range of masses as well.

Planets in multiplanet systems are expected to migrate inward as near-resonant chains, thus allowing them to undergo gravitational planet–planet interactions and possibly maintain a nonzero obliquity. The TRAPPIST-1 system is in such a near-resonant configuration, making it plausible that TRAPPIST-1e has a nonzero obliquity. In this work, we use the ExoCAM general circulation model to study the possible climates of TRAPPIST-1e at varying obliquities and atmospheric compositions. We vary obliquity from 0° to 90° and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide from 0.0004 bar (modern Earth-like) to 1 bar. We find that models with a higher obliquity are hotter overall and have a smaller day–night temperature contrast than the lower-obliquity models, which is consistent with previous studies. Most significantly, the superrotating high-altitude jet becomes subrotating at high obliquity, thus impacting cloud and surface temperature patterns. As the amount of carbon dioxide increases, the climate of TRAPPIST-1e becomes hotter, cloudier, and less variable. From modeled thermal phase curves, we find that the impact of obliquity could potentially have observable consequences due to the effect of cloud coverage on the outgoing longwave radiation.

SDSS J022932.28+713002.7是一个处于形成阶段的极低质量白矮星，其轨道周期为36小时，围绕着一颗质量大于1太阳质量的伴星运转。作者利用光谱学和光度学数据，测量了主要的前ELM白矮星的星体参数。主要白矮星的光变曲线表现为椭球形变化，结合径向速度数据和PHOEBE二进制模拟，估算出了看不见的伴星的质量。主白矮星的质量为太阳质量，而不可见的二级伴星的质量为太阳质量。伴星的质量表明它很可能是一个接近钱德拉塞卡极限质量的白矮星或是一个中子星。这个系统很可能最近从可见的主星向不可见的伴星发生罗奇波溢出。这个二进制系统的动力学配置与理论演化路径一致，主要白矮星目前正处于收缩阶段。测得的轨道周期将使这个系统走上稳定的演化路径，在数十亿年内，会形成一颗紧缩的ELM白矮星围绕着一颗致密的伴星。<br /><br />总结:SDSS J022932.28+713002.7是一个处于形成阶段的极低质量白矮星，其伴星质量较大，可能是一个接近钱德拉塞卡极限质量的白矮星或是一个中子星。该系统最近可能发生了罗奇波溢出。主要白矮星目前正处于收缩阶段，而测得的轨道周期将使这个系统走上稳定的演化路径。 <div>
We report the discovery of SDSS J022932.28+713002.7, a nascent extremely low-mass (ELM) white dwarf (WD) orbiting a massive (>1 M⊙ at 2σ confidence) companion with a period of 36 hr. We use a combination of spectroscopy, including data from the ongoing fifth-generation Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-V), and photometry to measure the stellar parameters of the primary pre-ELM WD. The lightcurve of the primary WD exhibits ellipsoidal variation, which we combine with radial velocity data and PHOEBE binary simulations to estimate the mass of the invisible companion. We find that the primary WD has mass M1 = M⊙ and the unseen secondary has mass M2 = M⊙. The mass of the companion suggests that it is most likely a near-Chandrasekhar-mass WD or a neutron star. It is likely that the system recently went through a Roche lobe overflow from the visible primary onto the invisible secondary. The dynamical configuration of the binary is consistent with the theoretical evolutionary tracks for such objects, and the primary is currently in its contraction phase. The measured orbital period puts this system on a stable evolutionary path which, within a few gigayears, will lead to a contracted ELM WD orbiting a massive compact companion.

<div> late-type, highly inclined disk galaxies, extraplanar X-ray point sources, Virgo cluster, Chandra observations, excess of X-ray sources

总结: 本研究对维尔戈星系团中的19个高度倾斜的后期型盘状星系进行了系统搜索，发现了在离盘面4.4-12千秒差距的区域内约20个超额的X射线源。这些发现无法被个体星系的恒星总体或宇宙X射线背景所解释，但在采用类似探测灵敏度的野外后期型边缘星系中，并没有发现相似的超额X射线源。文章讨论了观察到的超额的来源可能包括与球状团相关的低质量X射线双星、超新星引发的X射线双星以及因盘面气体被压缩而诱发的高质量X射线双星，以及维尔戈星系团中早期成员星系周围先前鉴定的一类星团内X射线源。结果表明这些X射线群体中没有一类能够自然主导观察到的超额，尽管超新星引发的X射线双星和压缩效应最有可能与观察到的超额有关。 <div>
We present a systematic search for extraplanar X-ray point sources around 19 late-type, highly inclined disk galaxies residing in the Virgo cluster, based on archival Chandra observations reaching a source detection sensitivity of L(0.5–8 keV) ∼ 1038 erg s−1. Based on the cumulative source surface density distribution as a function of projected vertical distance from the disk midplane, we identify a statistically significant (∼3.3σ) excess of ∼20 X-ray sources within a projected vertical off-disk distance of (∼4.4–12 kpc), the presence of which cannot be explained by the bulk stellar content of the individual galaxies, nor by the cosmic X-ray background. On the other hand, there is no significant evidence for an excess of extraplanar X-ray sources in a comparison sample of field late-type edge-on galaxies, for which Chandra observations reaching a similar source detection sensitivity are available. We discuss the possible origins for the observed excess, including low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) associated with globular clusters, supernova-kicked LMXBs, and high-mass X-ray binaries born in recent star formation induced by ram pressure stripping of the disk gas, as well as a class of intracluster X-ray sources previously identified around early-type member galaxies of Virgo. We find that none of these X-ray populations can naturally dominate the observed extraplanar excess, although supernova-kicked LMXBs and the effect of ram pressure are most likely relevant.

The recent discoveries of a remarkable glitch/antiglitch accompanied by fast radio burst (FRB)-like bursts from the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 have revealed the physical connection between the two. In this work, we study the statistical properties of radio bursts from the hyperactive repeating source FRB 20201124A and of glitches from the pulsar PSR B1737–30. For FRB 20201124A, we confirm that the probability density functions of fluctuations of energy, peak flux, duration, and waiting time well follow the Tsallis q-Gaussian distribution. The derived q values from q-Gaussian distribution keep approximately steady for different temporal interval scales, which indicates that there is a common scale-invariant structure in repeating FRBs. Similar scale-invariant properties can be found in PSR B1737–30's glitches, implying an underlying association between the origins of repeating FRBs and pulsar glitches. These statistical features can be well understood within the same physical framework of self-organized criticality systems.

The inversion of the relative content and spatial distribution characteristics of radioactive elements on the lunar surface, as inferred from gamma-ray spectrometer data, holds substantial importance for forecasting lunar surface compositions. During the inversion process of gamma-ray spectrometer data, galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) have engendered disruptive “stripe noise” in the distribution map of radioactive elements. This phenomenon significantly hampers the interpretation of data and the extraction of lunar surface information. The proposed approach adeptly separates the influence of GCR from the counting rate distribution map of the lunar surface by employing the empirical mode decomposition method. It achieves the deduction of GCR background from the Chang’e-2 gamma-ray spectrometer data with precision. Compared to conventional GCR background deduction methods employed by predecessors, this model does not need to process a large amount of original data repeatedly. Moreover, it achieves an accurate deduction of the GCR background without intricate formulaic derivations. The procedural simplicity and reduced time investment make this approach significantly superior.

<br />
红移大于3的光学暗淡和极为红的星系在过去的星系普查中被忽略。通过JADES、JEMS和SMILES的深度JWST成像，我们对这些星系进行了表征，发现存在大量含尘、后星暴型的星系，质量低至10的8次方太阳质量，低于Spitzer和ALMA的灵敏度极限。我们发现，在z大于6时，样本中包括大量“小红点”（NIRCam选定的尘埃泛红的活动星系核（AGN）候选体）。此外，我们还发现了5个具有巴尔望线断裂和高质量恒星的证据。这些结果表明，在JWST之前，来自暗淡源的被遮蔽的星形成率密度的贡献可能被低估了。我们还观察到，LRD中的老化恒星成分和高质量恒星量排除了来自热尘发射的主要贡献，这些源物理学上需要进一步的研究。调查测量系统性是探索未来数据的可能。 <br /><br />总结: 通过JWST的深度成像，我们发现了在先前的星系普查中被忽略的高红移星系种类。这些星系对星系总质量和星形成率的贡献被低估，尤其是在z大于6的时候。同时，我们发现了一些具有特殊性质的星系，需要进一步的观测和研究。 <div>
Using deep JWST imaging from JADES, JEMS, and SMILES, we characterize optically faint and extremely red galaxies at z > 3 that were previously missing from galaxy census estimates. The data indicate the existence of abundant, dusty, and poststarburst-like galaxies down to 108 M⊙, below the sensitivity limit of Spitzer and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Modeling the NIRCam and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry of these red sources can result in extremely high values for both stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR); however, including seven MIRI filters out to 21 μm results in decreased masses (median 0.6 dex for > 10) and SFRs (median 10× for SFR > 100 M⊙ yr−1). At z > 6, our sample includes a high fraction of “little red dots” (LRDs; NIRCam-selected dust-reddened active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates). We significantly measure older stellar populations in the LRDs out to rest-frame 3 μm (the stellar bump) and rule out a dominant contribution from hot dust emission, a signature of AGN contamination to stellar population measurements. This allows us to measure their contribution to the cosmic census at z > 3, below the typical detection limits of ALMA (LIR < 1012 L⊙). We find that these sources, which are overwhelmingly missed by HST and ALMA, could effectively double the obscured fraction of the star formation rate density at 4 < z < 6 compared to some estimates, showing that prior to JWST, the obscured contribution from fainter sources could be underestimated. Finally, we identify five sources with evidence for Balmer breaks and high stellar masses at 5.5 < z < 7.7. While spectroscopy is required to determine their nature, we discuss possible measurement systematics to explore with future data.

A near-infrared spectrum of nova V1716 Scorpii (PNV J17224490-4137160), a recent bright ( mag), Fermi-LAT detected γ-ray source, was modeled using the photoionization code CLOUDY. Abundances were estimated for He, C, N, O, Si, Al, Mg, Fe, Ne, S, Ca, and P. Notably, P (a factor of 120) and N (a factor of 248) are highly overabundant. It was necessary to assume the ejecta consist of two components (with a cylindrical geometry): a dense component from which the bulk of the H, He, and neutral O i and N emission arises and a more diffuse component from which most of the coronal lines arise. Some of the coronal lines are found to originate from both the dense and diffuse components. The mass of the ejecta, including neutral and ionized gas, is ≃4.19 × 10−4M⊙. Our analysis indicates that in the case of V1716 Sco (which has a carbon–oxygen white dwarf), a fraction of 25% white dwarf matter rather than 50% is favored for the mixing between a white dwarf and the accreted envelope before the outburst. This mixing ratio is like that found for oxygen–neon novae where a 25% mixing fraction is also indicated. Helium hydride—the first molecule to form after the Big Bang—may have formed in the ejecta of V1716 Sco based on photoionization modeling. This prediction suggests that novae may be potential formation sites of this important molecular ion.

<div> 关键词: James Webb Space Telescope, active galactic nuclei (AGN), supermassive black holes, cosmic reionization, SMBH mass function

总结: 
詹姆斯·韦伯空间望远镜发现了许多模糊的活跃星系核，它们对我们理解超大质量黑洞的形成、它们与宿主星系的共同演化，以及活跃星系核在宇宙再电离中的作用至关重要。研究人员利用光度颜色和大小测量，在JWST/NIRCam领域内进行了对紧凑红色天体的搜索，并发现了260个红移在4 < zphot < 9的红移星系核候选者。这些天体的模型拟合显示它们中度受尘埃消光（AV ∼ 1.6）, 具有辐射的光度（Lbol = 1044–47 erg s−1）和较暗的紫外光度（MUV ≃ −17 to −22）。另外，研究人员还对灰尘星系核的光度函数进行了估算，发现它们的数量密度比同等光度的紫外选取类星体高100倍。研究还显示这些天体只占了同等红移下所有紫外选取星系的一小部分，但在z ∼ 7时MUV ∼ −22时这个比例上升到约10%。最后，根据一个保守的Eddington速率的引力累积假设，研究人员得出了z ∼ 5时超大质量黑洞质量函数的下限，并发现它与之前的理论和JWST的观测一致。 <br /><br /> <div>
Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered numerous faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) at z ∼ 5 and beyond. These objects are key to our understanding of the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), their coevolution with host galaxies, as well as the role of AGN in cosmic reionization. Using photometric colors and size measurements, we perform a search for compact red objects in an array of blank deep JWST/NIRCam fields totaling ∼640 arcmin2. Our careful selection yields 260 reddened AGN candidates at 4 < zphot < 9, dominated by a point-source-like central component (〈reff〉 < 130 pc) and displaying a dichotomy in their rest-frame colors (blue UV and red optical slopes). Quasar model fitting reveals our objects to be moderately dust-extincted (AV ∼ 1.6), which is reflected in their inferred bolometric luminosities of Lbol = 1044–47 erg s−1 and fainter UV magnitudes MUV ≃ −17 to −22. Thanks to the large areas explored, we extend the existing dusty AGN luminosity functions to both fainter and brighter magnitudes, estimating their number densities to be ×100 higher than for UV-selected quasars of similar magnitudes. At the same time, they constitute only a small fraction of all UV-selected galaxies at similar redshifts, but this percentage rises to ∼10% for MUV ∼ − 22 at z ∼ 7. Finally, assuming a conservative case of accretion at the Eddington rate, we place a lower limit on the SMBH mass function at z ∼ 5, finding it to be consistent with both theory and previous JWST observations.

<div> 关键词：背景噪音、伽玛射线天文数据、去噪算法、局部密度取样、点源检测

总结：<br /><br />本研究介绍了一种针对伽玛射线天文数据的新型去噪算法，利用局部密度取样技术。该算法优先放大局部密度高的区域，减弱低密度区域的影响。这种选择性增强显著增强了聚类算法在定位点源方面的性能，有效地减少了被误认为真实源的高密度噪音的干扰。我们已经在费米大面积望远镜数据上实施了该算法，结果显示聚类算法在丢弃虚假源方面取得了显著进展。 <div>
Reducing background noise is essential for clear data analysis and signal detection. In this study, we introduce a novel denoising algorithm tailored for gamma-ray astronomical data, utilizing local density sampling techniques. The proposed algorithm preferentially amplifies regions of high local density, which are indicative of potential sources, while diminishing the influence of low-density areas. This selective enhancement significantly bolsters the performance of clustering algorithms in pinpointing point sources, effectively minimizing the interference of high-density noise that could be mistaken for genuine sources. We have implemented this algorithm on Fermi Large Area Telescope data, and our results showcase a marked advancement in the clustering algorithm's capacity to discard false sources.

<div> 电子-质子冲击波，粒子模拟，电流中和，电磁不稳定性，热化过程

总结:
通过动力学粒子在电磁场模拟中，我们可以观察到在电子-质子冲击波的上游区域存在着不同的过程。在远上游区域，电流主要由非热质子驱动，产生静电模式并产生超热电子，进入上游无穷远处。接近冲击波（在前趋区），电流密度和束流的动量通量增加，导致电磁流动不稳定性，有助于超热电子的热化。在冲击波脚附近，这些电子暴露在冲击波反射质子中，导致了双流不稳定性。这些发现对于理解磁场的放大以及可能导致超热电子进入扩散冲击加速过程的过程非常重要。 <div>
Collisionless shocks tend to send charged particles into the upstream, driving electric currents through the plasma. Using kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we investigate how the background thermal plasma neutralizes such currents in the upstream of quasi-parallel non-relativistic electron–proton shocks. We observe distinct processes in different regions: the far upstream, the shock precursor, and the shock foot. In the far upstream, the current is carried by nonthermal protons, which drive electrostatic modes and produce suprathermal electrons that move toward upstream infinity. Closer to the shock (in the precursor), both the current density and the momentum flux of the beam increase, which leads to electromagnetic streaming instabilities that contribute to the thermalization of suprathermal electrons. At the shock foot, these electrons are exposed to shock-reflected protons, resulting in a two-stream type instability. We analyze these processes and the resulting heating through particle tracking and controlled simulations. In particular, we show that the instability at the shock foot can make the effective thermal speed of electrons comparable to the drift speed of the reflected protons. These findings are important for understanding both the magnetic field amplification and the processes that may lead to the injection of suprathermal electrons into diffusive shock acceleration.

在这篇文章中，研究者利用A1063的星系红移数据，结合宇宙学模型，并考虑干扰因素和采样效应，推断出逃逸速度剖面，进而直接约束了引力势剖面。通过对比三种不同的密度模型，发现它们之间有很好的一致性。对于纳瓦罗-弗兰克-怀特模型，研究者发现log10(M200,crit) = M⊙，与六个最近出版的透镜质量估计结果一致。这种一致性因逃逸技术与透镜技术除了径向分bin之外没有共同系统偏差。这些质量估计结果比利用X射线数据和戈梅兹等人的速度离散度估计结果偏低2-4σ。研究者测量了r200内的1D速度离散度为km/s，结合逃逸速度质量估计值，使A1063的速度离散度首次与流体动力学宇宙模拟保持一致。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究利用星系红移数据推断了A1063的逃逸速度剖面，并利用引力势方程约束了引力势剖面，得到了与透镜质量估计结果一致的质量估计。这些估计结果明显低于利用X射线数据和速度离散度估计的结果。此外，研究还发现A1063的速度离散度与宇宙模拟结果保持一致。 <div>
We measure the radius–velocity phase-space edge profile of A1063 using galaxy redshifts from Karman et al. and Mercurio et al. Combined with a cosmological model and after accounting for interlopers and sampling effects, we infer the escape velocity profile. Using the Poisson equation, we then directly constrain the gravitational potential profile and find excellent agreement between three different density models. For the Navarro–Frenk–White profile, we find log10(M200,crit) = M⊙, consistent to within 1σ of six recently published lensing masses. We argue that this consistency is due to the fact that the escape technique shares no common systematics with lensing other than radial binning. These masses are 2–4σ lower than estimates made using X-ray data, in addition to the Gómezet al. velocity dispersion estimate. We measure the 1D velocity dispersion within r200 to be km s−1, which combined with our escape velocity mass, brings the dispersion for A1063 in-line with hydrodynamic cosmological simulations for the first time.

Parker Solar Probe搭载的IS⊙IS套件中的HET观测到了首次太阳γ射线事件，该事件与硬X射线耀斑、日冕物质喷发和太阳高能粒子事件有关。通过蒙特卡洛建模重建了入射γ射线光谱，展示了IS⊙IS仪器结合能够测量60keV至7MeV的硬X射线和γ射线。尽管这是任务的辅助科学目标，但IS⊙IS仪器测量γ射线的能力对于研究这一能量粒子群是重要的，因为目前观测太阳γ射线的仪器非常有限。 <div>
High-energy neutral solar radiation in the form of γ-rays and neutrons is produced as secondary products in solar flares. The characteristics of this emission can provide key information regarding the energization of charged particles, particularly when primary particles remain trapped in the corona. The Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (IS⊙IS) suite on Parker Solar Probe is composed of instruments primarily intended to measure energetic charged particles. However, the High Energy Telescope (HET) in IS⊙IS was also designed with a supplementary neutral mode intended to measure γ-rays and neutrons. HET observed its first clear solar γ-ray event in connection with a hard X-ray flare, the eruption of a coronal mass ejection, and a solar energetic particle event on 2022 September 5. The X-ray spectral shape was observed to harden over the course of the event, culminating with the observation of γ-rays by HET. A coincident enhancement in the lower-energy Energetic Particle Instrument (EPI-Lo) was also observed, likely produced by incident solar γ-rays despite the EPI-Lo instrument not having any special neutral measurement capabilities. We use Monte Carlo modeling to reconstruct the incident γ-ray spectrum based on the measured spectrum to demonstrate that the combination of IS⊙IS instruments can measure hard X-rays and γ-rays from ∼60 keV–7 MeV. Despite the fact that this is a supplemental science goal of the mission, the capability of the IS⊙IS instruments to measure γ-rays is important for the study of this population due to the very limited instruments currently observing the Sun in γ-rays.

这篇文章研究了ZFOURGE调查中约400个低质量（<10^9M⊙）Hα发射体（HAEs）的星系特性。这些HAEs的选择基于观测到的Ks波段通量与从最佳拟合光谱能量分布估计的恒星连续体之间的过剩。这些低质量HAEs的SFR（Hα）高于星系主序列，可能是宇宙再电离纪元中再电离宇宙的星系的潜在类比体。低质量HAEs的离子化光子产生效率（ξion）中位数值为，假设对恒星连续体进行Calzetti（SMC）曲线的尘埃校正。这个值比相似红移下主序星系的ξion高约0.2 dex，表明低质量HAEs在产生电离光子方面更有效。我们的结果也加强了ξion随红移增加的趋势，但揭示了随着红移增加ξion与恒星质量（M⊙）之间的“减小”关系。我们进一步探讨了ξion与其他星系特性的依赖关系，比如紫外光谱斜率（βUV）、紫外光度（MUV）和Hα以及[O iii]发射线的当量宽度。紫外光谱斜率更蓝、紫外光度更暗、以及具有更高等当量宽度的星系的ξion提高了约2倍，与我们样本的ξion中位数相比。JWST数据将提供机会扩展我们的方法，并进一步研究高红移处低质量星系的特性。

We investigate the galaxy properties of ∼400 low-mass (<109M⊙) Hα emitters (HAEs) at z ∼ 2.3 in the ZFOURGE survey. The selection of these HAEs is based on the excess in the observed Ks broadband flux compared to the stellar continuum estimated from the best-fit spectral energy distribution. These low-mass HAEs have elevated SFR(Hα) above the star formation main sequence, making them potential analogs of the galaxies that reionized the Universe during the Epoch of Reionization. The ionizing photon production efficiencies (ξion) of the low-mass HAEs have a median value of , assuming the Calzetti (SMC) curve for the stellar continuum dust correction. This value is higher than that of main-sequence galaxies by ∼0.2 dex at similar redshift, indicating that the low-mass HAEs are more efficient in producing ionizing photons. Our results also consolidate the trend of increasing ξion with redshift, but reveal a “downsizing” relationship between ξion and stellar mass (M⊙) with increasing redshift. We further explore the dependence of ξion on other galaxy properties, such as the UV spectral slope (βUV), the UV magnitude (MUV), and the equivalent widths of Hα and [O iii] emission lines. Galaxies with bluer UV slopes, fainter UV luminosities, and higher equivalent widths exhibit elevated ξion by a factor of ∼2 compared to the median ξion of our sample. JWST data will provide an opportunity to extend our method and further investigate the properties of low-mass galaxies at high redshifts.

We examine the evolution of the disk surrounding the Be star in the highly eccentric 10.8 yr binary system δ Scorpii over its three most recent periastron passages. V-band and B − V photometry, along with Hα spectroscopy, are combined with a new set of extensive multiband polarimetry data to produce a detailed comparison of the disk's physical conditions during the time periods surrounding each closest approach of the secondary star. We use the three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer code HDUST and a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code to support our observations with models of disk evolution, discussing the behavior of the Hα and He i 6678 Å lines, V-band magnitude, and polarization degree. We compare the characteristics of the disk immediately before each periastron passage to create a baseline for the unperturbed disk. We find that the extent of the Hα emitting region increased between each periastron passage, and that transient asymmetries in the disk become more pronounced with each successive encounter. Asymmetries of the Hα and He i 6678 Å lines in 2011 indicate that perturbations propagate inward through the disk near periastron. When the disk’s direction of orbit is opposite to that of the secondary, the parameters used in our models do not produce spiral density enhancements in the Hα emitting region because the tidal interaction time is short due to the relative velocities of the disk particles with the secondary. The effects of the secondary star on the disk are short-lived and the disk shows independent evolution between each periastron event.

本研究利用Athena++辐射模块研究了完整和过渡盘中的垂直剪切不稳定性（VSI）作用，并考虑了辐射传输和恒星照射。我们发现，热结构和冷却时间显著影响了垂直剪切不稳定性的行为。盘的内缘位置和径向光学深度也影响了盘的动力学。通过合成图像，我们发现在具有较大空洞的盘中，子结构更加明显。我们的模拟预测了具有显著温度变化的区域伴随着显著的速度变化，并可以通过ALMA的动力学和化学观测进行验证。这些发现有助于我们更好地理解原行星盘的动力学过程。 <br /><br /> <div>
Turbulence is crucial for protoplanetary disk dynamics, and vertical shear instability (VSI) is a promising mechanism in outer disk regions to generate turbulence. We use the Athena++ radiation module to study VSI in full and transition disks, accounting for radiation transport and stellar irradiation. We find that the thermal structure and cooling timescale significantly influence VSI behavior. The inner rim location and radial optical depth affect disk kinematics. Compared with previous vertically isothermal simulations, our full disk and transition disks with small cavities have a superheated atmosphere and cool midplane with long cooling timescales, which suppresses the corrugation mode and the associated meridional circulation. This temperature structure also produces a strong vertical shear at τ* = 1, producing an outgoing flow layer at τ* < 1 on top of an ingoing flow layer at τ* ∼ 1. The midplane becomes less turbulent, while the surface becomes more turbulent with effective α reaching ∼10−2 at τ* ≲ 1. This large surface stress drives significant surface accretion, producing substructures. Using temperature and cooling time measured/estimated from radiation-hydro simulations, we demonstrate that less computationally intensive simulations incorporating simple orbital cooling can almost reproduce radiation-hydro results. By generating synthetic images, we find that substructures are more pronounced in disks with larger cavities. The higher velocity dispersion at the gap edge could also slow particle settling. Both properties are consistent with recent near-IR and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations. Our simulations predict that regions with significant temperature changes are accompanied by significant velocity changes, which can be tested by ALMA kinematics/chemistry observations.

We performed linear calculations to determine the Type I planetary migration rate for 3D locally isothermal disks with radial temperature gradients. For 3D disks with radial temperature gradients, the linear wave equation has a divergent term of the third pole, which makes corotation a nonremoval singularity. We suppressed the divergence with the Landau prescription to obtain the wave solutions. Despite the singularity at corotation, we derived a definite torque on the planet because the divergent term amplifies the waves only in the neighborhood of corotation and has little effect on the planetary torque. Consequently, we derived the formulas for the total, Lindblad, and corotation torques for locally isothermal disks. The resulting torque term due to the disk temperature gradient agrees well with the results of previous 3D hydrodynamical simulations for locally isothermal disks. Our linear calculation also provides the 3D horseshoe torque, which is close to the results of previous 3D hydrodynamical simulations.

总结:
本文分析了Messier 101中SN 2023ixf的红超巨星（RSG）候选天体的大量爆发前地面和太空红外观测数据的整体集合，以及爆炸前在哈勃太空望远镜（HST）上获得的光学数据。作者们确认了候选天体与超新星（SN）的关联，并根据用Gemini-North仪器进行的SN观测，限定了SN点位的金属丰度。此外，通过高分辨率的Keck光谱，还确认了SN的内部宿主灭光。作者们运用尘埃辐射传输建模拟合了恒星的观测光谱能量分布（SED），考虑到其固有变化，该模型假设了位于潜在恒星光球之前的富含硅酸盐的尘埃壳。这颗星受尘埃遮挡严重，可能是迄今为止遇到的最尘埃丰富的候选天体。作者们得出了该星的有效温度和10^4L ⊙的中位估计值分别为2770K和9.0×。感谢提供给我们这样的非凡视角，这应该在未来几年继续在HST和詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜上进行跟踪观测。 <div>
We follow our first paper with an analysis of the ensemble of the extensive preexplosion ground- and space-based infrared observations of the red supergiant (RSG) progenitor candidate for the nearby core-collapse supernova SN 2023ixf in Messier 101, together with optical data prior to the explosion obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We have confirmed the association of the progenitor candidate with the supernova (SN), as well as constrained the metallicity at the SN site, based on SN observations with instruments at Gemini-North. The internal host extinction to the SN has also been confirmed from a high-resolution Keck spectrum. We fit the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) for the star, accounting for its intrinsic variability, with dust radiative-transfer modeling, which assumes a silicate-rich dust shell ahead of the underlying stellar photosphere. The star is heavily dust obscured, likely the dustiest progenitor candidate yet encountered. We found median estimates of the star’s effective temperature and luminosity of 2770 K and 9.0 × 104L⊙, with 68% credible intervals of 2340–3150 K and (7.5–10.9) × 104L⊙, respectively. The candidate may have a Galactic RSG analog, IRC −10414, with a strikingly similar SED and luminosity. Via comparison with single-star evolutionary models we have constrained the initial mass of the progenitor candidate from 12 M⊙ to as high as 14 M⊙. We have had available to us an extraordinary view of the SN 2023ixf progenitor candidate, which should be further followed up in future years with HST and the James Webb Space Telescope.

Protostars are born in magnetized environments. As a consequence, the formation of protostellar disks can be suppressed by the magnetic field, efficiently removing the angular momentum of the infalling material. Nonideal MHD effects are proposed as one way to allow protostellar disks to form. Thus, it is important to understand their contributions to observations of protostellar systems. We derive an analytical equation to estimate the ambipolar diffusivity coefficient at the edge of the protostellar disk in the Class 0/I protostar, HOPS-370, for the first time, under the assumption that the disk radius is set by ambipolar diffusion. Using previous results of the protostellar mass, disk mass, disk radius, density and temperature profiles, and magnetic field strength, we estimate the ambipolar diffusivity coefficient to be . We quantify the contribution of ambipolar diffusion by estimating its dimensionless Elsässer number to be , indicating its dynamical importance in this region. We compare our results to those of the chemical calculations of the ambipolar diffusivity coefficient using the Non-Ideal Magnetohydrodynamics Coefficients and Ionization Library, which are consistent with our results. In addition, we compare our derived ambipolar diffusivity coefficient to the diffusivity coefficients for ohmic dissipation and the Hall effect, and find ambipolar diffusion is dominant in our density regime. These results demonstrate a new methodology to understand nonideal MHD effects in observations of protostellar disks. More detailed modeling of the magnetic field, envelope, and microphysics, along with a larger sample of protostellar systems, is needed to further understand the contributions of nonideal MHD.

<br />模拟Jupiter的QQO在2D辐射动力模型中成功产生4年周期的赤道平流层振荡。波的动量通量引发赤道附近高空的东风-西风风流，引起温度变化，并在热带平流层区域引起上升和下降环流。该模拟结果与先前卫星和地面观测结果一致，并能够研究QQO对Jupiter的极地平流层的影响。QQO影响进一步延伸到上对流层，并与望远镜观测结果一致，形成弱的反相关关系。 
<br /><br />总结: 本研究成功模拟了Jupiter的QQO，发现在赤道平流层引发了4年周期的振荡，并观测到对上对流层和中纬度的影响。 <div>
We present a simulation of Jupiter’s quasi-quadrennial oscillation (QQO) in a 2D radiative-dynamical model. Launching an eastward Kelvin wave and a westward Rossby-gravity wave in the lower boundary, we successfully generate a 4 yr-period oscillation in the equatorial stratosphere. The momentum flux of waves initiates overlying easterly–westerly wind jets descending in altitude with the maximum temperature variation of ±5 K near 10 hPa at the equator. The tropical stratospheric region is dominated by upwelling and downwelling circulation cells induced by the QQO, affecting the midlatitude where stratospheric aerosols enrich. The simulation results are consistent with the previous satellite and ground-based observations in the low latitudes and provide the ability to examine the QQO’s influence in Jupiter’s extratropical stratosphere. The QQO influence further extends into the upper troposphere, forming a weak anticorrelation with the stratosphere oscillation in agreement with the result from 40 yr of telescope observations.

Luminous, compact emission-line galaxies (LCGs) are the most abundant class of confirmed Lyman continuum (LyC) emitters. An optical integral field study of the nearby LCG NGC 2366 reveals an outflow originating at the star cluster “knot B” thought to clear a channel via mechanical feedback that enables LyC escape. We observed NGC 2366 with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and detected X-ray emission from a point source coincident with the apex of the outflow at knot B. The pointlike nature and variability of the X-ray emission suggests accretion onto a compact object. The accretion could produce sufficient kinetic energy to power the outflow.

We present a complete census of candidate nuggets, i.e., dense galaxies likely formed by compaction with intense gas influx, within the volume-limited redshift z ∼ 0 REsolved Spectroscopy Of a Local VolumE (RESOLVE) survey. These nuggets span all evolutionary stages and 3 orders of magnitude in stellar mass (M* ∼ 108 to 1011M⊙) from the dwarf to the giant regime. We develop selection criteria for our z ∼ 0 nugget candidates based on structure and introduce the use of environmental criteria to eliminate nugget-like objects with suspected non-compaction origins. The resulting z ∼ 0 nuggets follow expectations with respect to structure (i.e., density, size), population frequency, and likely origins. We show that the properties of our nugget census are consistent with permanent quenching above the gas-richness threshold scale (halo mass Mhalo ∼ 1011.4M⊙), cyclic temporary quenching below the threshold scale, and feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) assisting in permanent quenching. As predicted in simulations, most nuggets quench within a halo mass range of Mhalo ∼ 1011.45 to 1011.9M⊙. We find ∼0.29 dex scatter around the star-forming main sequence for candidate blue nuggets below the threshold scale, which is consistent with temporary quenching as seen in simulations. A transitional population of green nuggets appears above the threshold scale. AGN also become more common in nuggets above this scale, and we see a likely AGN excess in nuggets versus comparably selected non-nuggets. Our results provide the first observational confirmation of the mass-dependent, AGN-mediated shift from cyclic quenching to halo quenching in nuggets.

GRB-SNe是与大质量恒星前体相关的伽玛射线暴超新星，它们可能产生了重元素。研究表明，在观测到的GRB-SNe中存在颜色的多样性，这可能与r过程物质的丰度有关。通过对四个GRB-SNe进行光学到近红外的颜色测量，结果表明其中三个可能含有0.01-0.15太阳质量的r过程物质，而第四个不符合r过程物质大于等于0.01太阳质量的模型。由于r过程物质可能被隐藏在超新星喷射物中，导致现有模型无法准确测量其质量，因此得到的结果可能被低估。建议未来的观测策略应该更多地关注GRB-SNe产生的r过程物质的全部分布。 <br /><br />总结: <br />GRB-SNe与重元素的r过程丰度存在着多样性，模型可能低估了r过程物质的质量，未来需要更多观测以全面探查GRB-SNe产生的r过程物质。 <div>
The existence of a secondary (in addition to compact object mergers) source of heavy element (r-process) nucleosynthesis, the core-collapse of rapidly rotating and highly magnetized massive stars, has been suggested by both simulations and indirect observational evidence. Here, we probe a predicted signature of r-process enrichment, a late-time (≳40 days post-burst) distinct red color, in observations of gamma-ray burst supernovae (GRB-SNe), which are linked to these massive star progenitors. We present optical to near-IR color measurements of four GRB-SNe at z ≲ 0.4, extending out to >500 days post-burst, obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope and large-aperture ground-based telescopes. Comparison of our observations to models indicates that GRBs 030329, 100316D, and 130427A are consistent with both no enrichment and producing 0.01–0.15 M⊙ of r-process material if there is a low amount of mixing between the inner r-process ejecta and outer supernova (SN) layers. GRB 190829A is not consistent with any models with r-process enrichment ≥0.01 M⊙. Taken together the sample of GRB-SNe indicates color diversity at late times. Our derived yields from GRB-SNe may be underestimated due to r-process material hidden in the SN ejecta (potentially due to low mixing fractions) or the limits of current models in measuring r-process mass. We conclude with recommendations for future search strategies to observe and probe the full distribution of r-process produced by GRB-SNe.

The PHANGS survey uses Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, Hubble Space Telescope, Very Large Telescope, and JWST to obtain an unprecedented high-resolution view of nearby galaxies, covering millions of spatially independent regions. The high dimensionality of such a diverse multiwavelength data set makes it challenging to identify new trends, particularly when they connect observables from different wavelengths. Here, we use unsupervised machine-learning algorithms to mine this information-rich data set to identify novel patterns. We focus on three of the PHANGS-JWST galaxies, for which we extract properties pertaining to their stellar populations; warm ionized and cold molecular gas; and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), as measured over 150 pc scale regions. We show that we can divide the regions into groups with distinct multiphase gas and PAH properties. In the process, we identify previously unknown galaxy-wide correlations between PAH band and optical line ratios and use our identified groups to interpret them. The correlations we measure can be naturally explained in a scenario where the PAHs and the ionized gas are exposed to different parts of the same radiation field that varies spatially across the galaxies. This scenario has several implications for nearby galaxies: (i) The uniform PAH ionized fraction on 150 pc scales suggests significant self-regulation in the interstellar medium, (ii) the PAH 11.3/7.7 μm band ratio may be used to constrain the shape of the non-ionizing far-ultraviolet to optical part of the radiation field, and (iii) the varying radiation field affects line ratios that are commonly used as PAH size diagnostics. Neglecting this effect leads to incorrect or biased PAH sizes.

Poststarburst galaxies are believed to be in a rapid transition between major merger starbursts and quiescent ellipticals, where active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback is suggested as one of the processes responsible for the quenching. To study the role of AGN feedback, we constructed a sample of poststarburst candidates with AGN and indications of ionized outflows in optical. We use MUSE/VLT observations to spatially resolve the properties of the stars and multiphase gas in five of them. All galaxies show signatures of interaction/merger in their stellar or gas properties, with some at an early stage of interaction with companions ∼50 kpc, suggesting that optical poststarburst signatures may be present well before the final starburst and coalescence. We detect narrow and broad kinematic components in multiple transitions in all the galaxies. Our detailed analysis of their kinematics and morphology suggests that, contrary to our expectation, the properties of the broad kinematic components are inconsistent with AGN-driven winds in three out of five galaxies. The two exceptions are also the only galaxies in which spatially resolved NaID P-Cygni profiles are detected. In some cases, the observations are more consistent with interaction-induced galactic-scale flows, an often overlooked process. These observations raise the question of how to interpret broad kinematic components in interacting and perhaps also in active galaxies, in particular when spatially resolved observations are not available or cannot rule out merger-induced galactic-scale motions. We suggest that NaID P-Cygni profiles are more effective outflow tracers, and use them to estimate the energy that is carried by the outflow.

The growing number of Milky Way satellites detected in recent years has introduced a new focus for stellar abundance analysis. Abundances of stars in satellites have been used to probe the nature of these systems and their chemical evolution. However, for most satellites, only centrally located stars have been examined. This paper presents an analysis of three stars in the Tucana V system, one in the inner region and two at ∼10′ (7–10 half-light radii) from the center. We find a remarkable chemical diversity between the stars. One star exhibits enhancements in rapid neutron-capture elements (an r-I star), and another is highly enhanced in C, N, and O but with low neutron-capture abundances (a CEMP-no star). The metallicities of the stars analyzed span more than 1 dex from [Fe/H] = −3.55 to −2.46. This, combined with a large abundance range of other elements like Ca, Sc, and Ni, confirms that Tuc V is an ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxy. The variation in abundances, highlighted by [Mg/Ca] ratios ranging from +0.89 to −0.75, among the stars demonstrates that the chemical enrichment history of Tuc V was very inhomogeneous. Tuc V is only the second UFD galaxy in which stars located at large distances from the galactic center have been analyzed, along with Tucana II. The chemical diversity seen in these two galaxies, driven by the composition of the noncentral member stars, suggests that distant member stars are important to include when classifying faint satellites and that these systems may have experienced more complex chemical enrichment histories than previously anticipated.

The secular Laplace–Lagrange orbital solution, decomposing eccentricities into a set of uniformly precessing eigenmodes, is a classical result that is typically solved numerically. However, in the limit where orbits are closely spaced, several simplifications make it possible to make analytical progress. We derive simple expressions for the eccentricity eigenmodes in a coplanar three-planet system where the middle planet is much less massive than its neighbors, and we show that these approximate the true eigenmodes of more general systems with three massive planets in various limits. These results provide intuition for the secular dynamics of real systems, and have applications for understanding the stability boundary for compact multiplanet systems.

这篇文章研究了关于星盘的稳定性问题，发现了一种新的非轴对称不稳定性——超声速旋转不稳定性(SARIs)。它们在复杂的本征频率平面上填充了大量不稳定区域，能够与当地多普勒速度同步，且在阿尔文共振区域之间径向局部化。研究使用了新型磁流体动力学模拟代码Legolas，验证了这些新型模式的存在并计算了它们的增长率。此外，研究还探讨了磁场强度和方向对不稳定性的影响，发现非轴对称模式在高模数时能够显著扩展不稳定区域，且其最大增长率可与MRI相媲美。最后，研究还重新审视了最近的色散关系，并强调了它们与全局框架的关系。 <div>
Accretion disks are highly unstable to magnetic instabilities driven by shear flow, where classically, the axisymmetric, weak-field magnetorotational instability (MRI) has received much attention through local WKB approximations. In contrast, discrete nonaxisymmetric counterparts require a more involved analysis through a full global approach to deal with the influence of the nearby magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) continua. Recently, rigorous MHD spectroscopy identified a new type of ultralocalized, nonaxisymmetric instability in global disks with super-Alfvénic flow. These super-Alfvénic rotational instabilities (SARIs) fill vast unstable regions in the complex eigenfrequency plane with (near eigen)modes that corotate at the local Doppler velocity and are radially localized between Alfvénic resonances. Unlike discrete modes, they are utterly insensitive to the radial disk boundaries. In this work, we independently confirm the existence of these unprecedented modes using our novel spectral MHD code Legolas, reproducing and extending our earlier study with detailed eigenspectra and eigenfunctions. We calculate the growth rates of SARIs and MRI in a variety of disk equilibria, highlighting the impact of field strength and orientation, and find correspondence with analytical predictions for thin, weakly magnetized disks. We show that nonaxisymmetric modes can significantly extend instability regimes at high mode numbers, with maximal growth rates comparable to those of the MRI. Furthermore, we explicitly show a region filled with quasi-modes whose eigenfunctions are extremely localized in all directions. These modes must be ubiquitous in accretion disks, and play a role in local shearing box simulations. Finally, we revisit recent dispersion relations in the appendix, highlighting their relation to our global framework.

<title>On the Roles of Stellar Rotation and Binarity in NGC 2423's Main-sequence Turnoff Region</title>

<div> eMSTO, NGC 2423, 星团, 恒星自转, 二元系统
<br /><br />
NGC 2423是一个位于银河系中的相对年老的开放星团，其表现出的eMSTO现象由恒星自转所驱动。研究发现，与快速自转的恒星相比，缓慢自转的恒星更有可能形成年轻的恒星群。这引发了对它们是否经历了内部旋转混合过程的猜测，其中一个设想是许多缓慢自转的恒星存在于紧密的双星系统中，而这些系统的潮汐力来自伴星，导致了它们的自转减速。然而，观测结果不符合这些预测。有趣的是，在观测到的两个质量相等的双星系统中，我们发现其中一个是潮汐锁定的双星系统，这进一步验证了我们数值模拟结果的有效性。总结：NGC 2423星团的eMSTO表现受恒星自转驱动，与当前的研究结果一致，并未观测到与缓慢自转恒星有关的特定现象。 <div>
Research has shown that many young and intermediate-age clusters (younger than ∼2 Gyr) have extended main sequences and extended main-sequence turnoffs (eMSTOs), which cannot be adequately described by a single isochrone. The reason for the extended main sequences is now known, with the most probable cause being the fast rotation of stars. However, a significant fraction of slowly rotating stars form a younger stellar population than their fast-rotating counterparts, leading to speculation that they have undergone rotational mixing processes internally. One speculation is that a considerable number of slowly rotating stars reside in close binary systems, where tidal forces from companion stars are the cause of their rotational deceleration. In this work, we report a relatively old open star cluster in the Milky Way, NGC 2423 (∼1 Gyr old), which exhibits an apparent eMSTO. As anticipated, many characteristics of NGC 2423 indicate that its eMSTO is driven by stellar rotations. Our calculations indicate that if slowly rotating stars commonly have a close companion star, they should exhibit significant differences in radial velocities observationally, and binary systems that can be tidally locked within the age of NGC 2423 should have a mass ratio close to 1. However, none of these predictions align with our observations. Interestingly, among the only two equal-mass binary systems in the observed region for which spectroscopic data could be obtained, we discovered that one of them is a tidally locked binary system. This further suggests the validity of our numerical simulation results.

We combine pulsar population synthesis with simulation-based inference (SBI) to constrain the magnetorotational properties of isolated Galactic radio pulsars. We first develop a framework to model neutron star birth properties and their dynamical and magnetorotational evolution. We specifically sample initial magnetic field strengths, B, and spin periods, P, from lognormal distributions and capture the late-time magnetic field decay with a power law. Each lognormal is described by a mean, , and standard deviation, , while the power law is characterized by the index, alate. We subsequently model the stars’ radio emission and observational biases to mimic detections with three radio surveys, and we produce a large database of synthetic P– diagrams by varying our five magnetorotational input parameters. We then follow an SBI approach that focuses on neural posterior estimation and train deep neural networks to infer the parameters’ posterior distributions. After successfully validating these individual neural density estimators on simulated data, we use an ensemble of networks to infer the posterior distributions for the observed pulsar population. We obtain , and , for the lognormal distributions and for the power law at the 95% credible interval. We contrast our results with previous studies and highlight uncertainties of the inferred alate value. Our approach represents a crucial step toward robust statistical inference for complex population synthesis frameworks and forms the basis for future multiwavelength analyses of Galactic pulsars.

高分辨率ALMA和多波段JWST图像揭示了星暴星系PACS-819在z = 1.45（M* = 1010.7M⊙）的特征。研究表明，PACS-819呈现出中心质量浓度和类似螺旋的结构，与典型的强星爆不同。ALMA的CO（J = 5–4）发现PACS-819具有旋转主导的盘状特性，但在CO动力学和JWST图像中存在不规则和不对称的特征，支持其受到相互作用的影响。JWST图像还揭示了恒星质量和尘埃衰减的分布，进一步阐明了不同结构组分之间的关系。最后，PACS-819的观测结果显示其中心区域具有高分子气体丰度，整个系统的气体耗尽时间较短。这些发现为理解遥远宇宙中星爆的复杂性提供了见解，并强调了利用ALMA和JWST高分辨率观测获得丰富信息的重要性。<br /><br />总结: ALMA和JWST观测揭示了星暴星系PACS-819的盘状结构、相互作用影响、恒星质量和尘埃分布，以及高分子气体丰度和耗尽时间的重要信息。 <div>
We present observations and analysis of the starburst PACS-819 at z = 1.45 (M* = 1010.7M⊙), using high-resolution (0.″1; 0.8 kpc) Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and multiwavelength JWST images from the COSMOS-Web program. Dissimilar to Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ACS images in the rest-frame UV, the redder NIRCam and MIRI images reveal a smooth central mass concentration and spiral-like features, atypical for such an intense starburst. Through dynamical modeling of the CO (J = 5–4) emission with ALMA, PACS-819 is rotation dominated and thus consistent with having a disk-like nature. However, kinematic anomalies in CO and asymmetric features in the bluer JWST bands (e.g., F150W) support a more disturbed nature likely due to interactions. The JWST imaging further enables us to map the distribution of stellar mass and dust attenuation, thus clarifying the relationships between different structural components not discernible in the previous HST images. The CO (J = 5–4) and far-infrared dust continuum emission are cospatial with a heavily obscured starbursting core (<1 kpc) that is partially surrounded by much less obscured star-forming structures including a prominent arc, possibly a tidally distorted dwarf galaxy, and a massive clump (detected in CO), likely a recently accreted low-mass satellite. With spatially resolved maps, we find a high molecular gas fraction in the central area reaching ∼3 (Mgas/M*) and short depletion times (Mgas/SFR ∼ 120 Myr, where SFR is star formation rate) across the entire system. These observations provide insights into the complex nature of starbursts in the distant Universe and underscore the wealth of complementary information from high-resolution observations with both ALMA and JWST.

总结:<br />
本文研究了不同恒星群合成模型对高红移星系测量和复离子时期电离光子预算的影响。研究发现，不同模型会导致紫外光度函数振幅相差≲0.5 dex；同时，包含双星的模型产生的电离光子比不包含双星的模型多约40%。然而，这些差异比不同恒星群合成模型造成的差异要小，例如BPASS模型产生的电离光子比其他模型多约100%。 <div>
The luminosity and spectral energy distribution of high-z galaxies are sensitive to the stellar-population synthesis (SPS) models. In this paper, we study the effects of different SPS models on the measurements of high-z galaxies and the budget of ionizing photons during the epoch of reionization by employing each of them in the semianalytical galaxy formation model L-Galaxies 2020. We find that the different SPS models lead to ≲0.5 dex differences on the amplitudes of UV luminosity functions, while two modes of the same SPS model with and without the inclusion of binary stars lead to similar UV luminosity functions at z ≥ 6. Instead, the binary stars produce ∼40% more ionizing photons than the single stars, while such differences are smaller than those caused by different SPS models; for example, the BPASS model produces ∼100% more ionizing photons than other models.

文章研究了基于Adhikari等人开发的方法，利用Kolmogorov现象学，研究了各种湍流级联速率与太阳周期的相关性。我们还扩展了这种方法，推导了Iroshnikov-Kriachnan (IK)现象学的加热速率。我们从1995年到2020年的WIND航天器的等离子体和磁力计数据中得出了观测到的湍流级联速率。我们发现，(i) Kolmogorov现象学和IK现象学得出的湍流级联速率随太阳周期变化，太阳最活跃期时速率最大，最不活跃期时速率最小；(ii) 湍流能量Kolmogorov级联速率随着θUB（平均磁场和速度之间的夹角）从0°变化到90°时增加，并在θUB ≈ 90°时达到峰值，然后随着θUB接近180°而减小；(iii) 二维湍流加热速率大于板条加热速率；(iv) 二维和板条的磁能密度级联速率大于湍动动能的级联速率；(v) 总湍流能量级联速率与太阳风速和温度以及标准交叉亲和性级联速率呈正相关。最后，我们发现总湍流能量Kolmogorov级联速率大于IK级联速率。 <div>
We study the solar cycle dependence of various turbulence cascade rates based on the methodology developed by Adhikari et al. that utilizes Kolmogorov phenomenology. This approach is extended to derive the heating rates for an Iroshnikov–Kriachnan (IK) phenomenology. The observed turbulence cascade rates corresponding to the total turbulence energy, fluctuating magnetic energy density, fluctuating kinetic energy, and the normalized cross helicity are derived from WIND spacecraft plasma and magnetometer data from 1995 through 2020. We find that (i) the turbulence cascade rate derived from a Kolmogorov phenomenology and an IK phenomenology changes with solar cycle, such that the cascade rate is largest during solar maximum and smallest during solar minimum; (ii) the turbulence energy Kolmogorov cascade rate increases from θUB (angle between mean magnetic field and velocity) = 0° to 90° and peaks near θUB = 90°, and then decreases as θUB tends to 180°; (iii) the 2D turbulence heating rate is larger than the slab heating rate; (iv) the 2D and slab fluctuating magnetic energy density cascade rates are larger than the corresponding cascade rates of the fluctuating kinetic energy; and (v) the total turbulence energy cascade rate is positively correlated with the solar wind speed and temperature and the normalized cross-helicity cascade rate. Finally, we find that the total turbulent energy Kolmogorov cascade rate is larger than the IK cascade rate.

Galaxy formation models within cosmological hydrodynamical simulations contain numerous parameters with nontrivial influences over the resulting properties of simulated cosmic structures and galaxy populations. It is computationally challenging to sample these high dimensional parameter spaces with simulations, in particular for halos in the high-mass end of the mass function. In this work, we develop a novel sampling and reduced variance regression method, CARPoolGP, which leverages built-in correlations between samples in different locations of high dimensional parameter spaces to provide an efficient way to explore parameter space and generate low-variance emulations of summary statistics. We use this method to extend the Cosmology and Astrophysics with machinE Learning Simulations to include a set of 768 zoom-in simulations of halos in the mass range of 1013–1014.5M⊙h−1 that span a 28-dimensional parameter space in the IllustrisTNG model. With these simulations and the CARPoolGP emulation method, we explore parameter trends in the Compton Y–M, black hole mass–halo mass, and metallicity–mass relations, as well as thermodynamic profiles and quenched fractions of satellite galaxies. We use these emulations to provide a physical picture of the complex interplay between supernova and active galactic nuclei feedback. We then use emulations of the Y–M relation of massive halos to perform Fisher forecasts on astrophysical parameters for future Sunyaev–Zeldovich observations and find a significant improvement in forecasted constraints. We publicly release both the simulation suite and CARPoolGP software package.

The origin of multiple peaks in light curves of various wavelengths remains illusive during flares. Here we discuss the flare of SOL2023-05-09T03:54M6.5 with six flux peaks as recorded by a tandem of new microwave and hard X-ray (HXR) instruments. According to its microwave spectra, the flare represents a high-turnover-frequency (>15 GHz) event. The rather-complete microwave and HXR spectral coverage provides a rare opportunity to uncover the origin of such an event together with simultaneous EUV images. We concluded that (1) the microwave sources originates around the top section of the flaring loops with a trend of source spatial dispersion with frequency; (2) the visible movement of the microwave source from peak to peak originates from the process of new flaring loops appearing sequentially along the magnetic neutral line; (3) the optically thin microwave spectra are hard with the indices (αtn) varying from ∼−1.2 to −0.4, and the turnover frequency always exceeds 15 GHz; (4) higher turnover/peak frequency corresponds to stronger peak intensity and harder optically thin spectra. Using the Fokker–Planck and GX Simulator codes we obtained a good fit to the observed microwave spectra and spatial distribution of the sources at all peaks, if assuming the radiating energetic electrons have the same spatial distribution and single-power-law spectra but with the number density varying in a range of ∼30%. We conclude that the particle acceleration in this flare happens in a compact region nearing the loop-top. These results provide new constraints on the acceleration of energetic electrons and the underlying flare intermittent reconnection process.

本研究对31个小红点（LRD）进行了研究，发现它们主要由恒星辐射组成，能够快速估算恒星质量。红移中值和四分位数为55%的光谱测量提供了重要信息。LRD的数量密度为10^-4.0±0.1 Mpc^-3，占全球类似红移和质量的星系总数的14% ± 3%。在红移平均值附近的近红外/中红外（2-4μm）光谱斜率显示出大量暖尘。研究还发现LRD的自然多样性，但许多最佳拟合模型对应于极其强烈和紧凑的恒星形成星系，其全局能量输出主要由OB恒星的直接（在平坦的静止波段紫外光和光谱范围中）和尘埃再循环辐射组成，同时也有一些来自红外线的暗藏AGN的贡献。 <div>
We study 31 little red dots (LRD) detected by JADES/NIRCam and covered by the SMILES/MIRI survey, of which ∼70% are detected in the two bluest MIRI bands and 40% in redder MIRI filters. The median/quartiles redshifts are (55% spectroscopic). The spectral slopes flatten in the rest-frame near-infrared, consistent with a 1.6 μm stellar bump but bluer than direct pure emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN) tori. The apparent dominance of stellar emission at these wavelengths for many LRDs expedites stellar mass estimation: the median/quartiles are . The number density of LRDs is 10−4.0±0.1 Mpc−3, accounting for 14% ± 3% of the global population of galaxies with similar redshifts and masses. The rest-frame near-/mid-infrared (2–4 μm) spectral slope reveals significant amounts of warm dust (bolometric attenuation ∼3–4 mag). Our spectral energy distribution modeling implies the presence of <0.4 kpc diameter knots, heated by either dust-enshrouded OB stars or an AGN producing a similar radiation field, obscured by A(V) > 10 mag. We find a wide variety in the nature of LRDs. However, the best-fitting models for many of them correspond to extremely intense and compact starburst galaxies with mass-weighted ages 5–10 Myr, very efficient in producing dust, with their global energy output dominated by the direct (in the flat rest-frame ultraviolet and optical spectral range) and dust-recycled emission from OB stars with some contribution from an obscured AGN (in the infrared).

ALMA进行了对Orion B North分子云内73个无恒星和原恒星核的第三个循环观测。在106 GHz处检测到34个连续源，其中四个被确定为无恒星。通过合成观测模拟发现，应该可以检测到至少两个无恒星核，与实际数据一致。通过对核进行简单的维里分析，发现Chamaeleon I的核的特性不同于Ophiuchus和Orion B North的核，这可能解释了它们没有遵循湍流模型预测的原因，而后两者与模型一致。 <div>
We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Cycle 3 observations of 73 starless and protostellar cores in the Orion B North molecular cloud. We detect a total of 34 continuum sources at 106 GHz, and after comparisons with other data, four of these sources appear to be starless. Three of the four sources are located near groupings of protostellar sources, while one source is an isolated detection. We use synthetic observations of a simulation modeling a collapsing turbulent, magnetized core to compute the expected number of starless cores that should be detectable with our ALMA observations and find at least two (1.52) starless cores should be detectable (at 5σ), consistent with our data. We run a simple virial analysis of the cores to put the Orion B North observations into context with similar previous ALMA surveys of cores in Chamaeleon I and Ophiuchus. We conclude that the Chamaeleon I starless core population is characteristically less bounded than the other two populations, along with external pressure contributions dominating the binding energy of the cores. These differences may explain why the Chamaeleon I cores do not follow turbulent model predictions, while the Ophiuchus and Orion B North cores are consistent with the model.

The [C ii] 158 μm emission line and the underlying far-infrared (FIR) dust continuum are important tracers for studying star formation and kinematic properties of early galaxies. We present a survey of the [C ii] emission lines and FIR continua of 31 luminous quasars at z > 6.5 using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array at sub-arcsec resolution. This survey more than doubles the number of quasars with [C ii] and FIR observations at these redshifts and enables statistical studies of quasar host galaxies deep into the epoch of reionization. We detect [C ii] emission in 27 quasar hosts with a luminosity range of L[C II] = (0.3–5.5) × 109L⊙ and detect the FIR continuum of 28 quasar hosts with a luminosity range of LFIR = (0.5–13.0) × 1012L⊙. Both L[C II] and LFIR are correlated (ρ ≃ 0.4) with the quasar bolometric luminosity, albeit with substantial scatter. The quasar hosts detected by ALMA are clearly resolved with a median diameter of ∼5 kpc. About 40% of the quasar host galaxies show a velocity gradient in [C ii] emission, while the rest show either dispersion-dominated or disturbed kinematics. Basic estimates of the dynamical masses of the rotation-dominated host galaxies yield Mdyn = (0.1–7.5) × 1011M⊙. Considering our findings alongside those of literature studies, we found that the ratio between MBH and Mdyn is about 10 times higher than that of local MBH–Mdyn relation on average but with substantial scatter (the ratio difference ranging from ∼0.6 to 60) and large uncertainties.

<br />在这篇论文中，作者介绍了使用CUBS建立的一个包括103个独特星系或星系团的样本，以研究O vi和Ne viii吸收探测的暖热宇宙介质（CGM）。这些星系和相关的邻近星系是在距离15个CUBS QSOs的视线不到1物理Mpc处被发现的，其中QSO的红移大于0.8。共有30个星系或星系团在±250 km/s的视向速度范围内显示出O viλλ 1031, 1037双线吸收，而其余的则在O vi的检测限度下没有显示出O vi的痕迹。与此同时，仅有五个星系或星系团显示出Ne viiiλλ 770, 780双线吸收，下降到一个极限柱密度。这些携带O vi和Ne viii的晕存在于不同的星系环境中，其恒星质量范围从10^9.5太阳质量到10^11.5太阳质量。不同恒星质量和恒星形成率的星系周围的暖热CGM显示出不同的空间特征和动力学。总的来说，O vi和Ne viii探测的暖热CGM被认为是L*以下星系中的主导相，基于它们在CGM中的高电离分数。 
<br /><br />总结: 本文介绍了利用CUBS建立的星系样本，用于研究O vi和Ne viii吸收。30个星系显示出O vi吸收，5个星系显示出Ne viii吸收。暖热CGM的分布对恒星质量和星系形成率有不同的影响。 <div>
This paper presents a newly established sample of 103 unique galaxies or galaxy groups at 0.4 ≲ z ≲ 0.7 from the Cosmic Ultraviolet Baryon Survey (CUBS) for studying the warm-hot circumgalactic medium (CGM) probed by both O vi and Ne viii absorption. The galaxies and associated neighbors are identified at <1 physical Mpc from the sightlines toward 15 CUBS QSOs at zQSO ≳ 0.8. A total of 30 galaxies or galaxy groups exhibit associated O viλλ 1031, 1037 doublet absorption within a line-of-sight velocity interval of ±250 km s−1, while the rest show no trace of O vi to a detection limit of . Meanwhile, only five galaxies or galaxy groups exhibit the Ne viiiλλ 770, 780 doublet absorption, down to a limiting column density of . These O vi- and Ne viii-bearing halos reside in different galaxy environments with stellar masses ranging from to ≈11.5. The warm-hot CGM around galaxies of different stellar masses and star formation rates exhibits different spatial profiles and kinematics. In particular, star-forming galaxies with show a significant concentration of metal-enriched warm-hot CGM within the virial radius, while massive quiescent galaxies exhibit flatter radial profiles of both column densities and covering fractions. In addition, the velocity dispersion of O vi absorption is broad with συ > 40 km s−1 for galaxies of within the virial radius, suggesting a more dynamic warm-hot halo around these galaxies. Finally, the warm-hot CGM probed by O vi and Ne viii is suggested to be the dominant phase in sub-L* galaxies with based on their high ionization fractions in the CGM.

<div> 非热速度测量，活动区域，Alfvén波湍流建模，16个相互作用磁通管，极端紫外成像光谱仪
<br /><br />该研究使用日珥上的极端紫外成像光谱仪对11个活动区域进行了非热速度测量。前期研究表明，热环核心中的热环中的非热速度小于日珥冠上再连接喷流模型或与阿尔芬波相关的激波加热所预测的速度。观察到的线宽也与与日珥冠上的再连接喷流模型或由于日珥纳米耀影的色球蒸发模型不一致。作者指出，最近高分辨率的Alfvén波湍流模型的进展使我们能够获得与活动区域中测量的非热速度相似的非热速度。在研究的11个活动区域中观察到的非热速度在17-30 km/s范围内，与作者16个相互作用的磁通管模型预测的15-37 km/s范围内的光谱线非热宽度一致。 <div>
We present a study of spectral line width measurements from the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer on Hinode. We used spectral line profiles of Fe xvi 262.984 Å, Fe xiv 264.787 Å, Fe xiv 270.519 Å, Fe xiv 274.203 Å, and Fe xv 284.160 Å, and studied 11 active regions. Previous studies of spectral line widths have shown that in hot loops in the cores of active regions, the observed nonthermal velocities are smaller than predicted from models of reconnection jets in the corona or shock heating associated with Alfvén waves. The observed line widths are also inconsistent with models of chromospheric evaporation due to coronal nanoflares. We show that recent advances in higher resolution Alfvén wave turbulence modeling enables us to obtain nonthermal velocities similar to those measured in active regions. The observed nonthermal velocities for the 11 active regions in our study are in the range of 17–30 km s−1, consistent with the spectral line nonthermal widths predicted from our model of 16 interacting flux tubes, which are in the range of 15–37 km s−1.

总结: 这篇文章介绍了在建模各种天体物理源（包括事件视界望远镜（EHT）源）时所需的同步辐射发射率、吸收率、法拉第旋转和转换系数。作者提出了一种估计传输系数的方法，利用电子分布函数的线性依赖性，将分布函数分解为若干部分，并分别计算其发射率。这种随机平均的方法在估计具有高能截断的各向同性κ分布函数的发射率以及评估子网格湍流对体积平均发射率的影响方面都有应用。作者发现，对于适用于EHT源的参数，湍流使发射率略微降低。在红外波段，湍流可以显著增加发射率。 <br /><br />总结: 本文介绍了建模天体物理源所需的同步辐射发射率、吸收率、法拉第旋转和转换系数的估算方法，并提供了具体的应用案例。 <div>
Synchrotron emissivities, absorptivities, and Faraday rotation and conversion coefficients are needed in modeling a variety of astrophysical sources, including Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) sources. We develop a method for estimating transfer coefficients that exploits their linear dependence on the electron distribution function, decomposing the distribution function into a sum of parts each of whose emissivity can be calculated easily. We refer to this procedure as stochastic averaging and apply it in two contexts. First, we use it to estimate the emissivity of an isotropic κ distribution function with a high-energy cutoff. The resulting coefficients can be evaluated efficiently enough to be used directly in ray-tracing calculations, and we provide an example calculation. Second, we use stochastic averaging to assess the effect of subgrid turbulence on the volume-averaged emissivity and along the way provide a prescription for a turbulent emissivity. We find that for parameters appropriate to EHT sources turbulence reduces the emissivity slightly. In the infrared, turbulence can dramatically increase the emissivity.

<div> 螺旋星系、Σ1、星族属性、星形成、高Σ1蓝色螺旋星系

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了高Σ1和低Σ1蓝色螺旋星系的空间分辨率星族和星形成特性。研究发现，高Σ1蓝色螺旋星系中心年龄较年轻，α元素增强较低的比例较高，约为55%，而低Σ1蓝色螺旋星系中心年龄较年轻的比例约为30%。年轻中心的星系具有较高的中心特定星形成率，并且遵循基于spaxel的星形成主序关系。同时，研究结果还表明，高Σ1蓝色螺旋星系的年轻化可能与星系的棒状结构或星系间相互作用有关。未被影响的蓝色螺旋星系则符合内向生长的模式。 <div>
Quiescent galaxies generally possess denser cores than star-forming galaxies with similar mass. As a measurement of the core density, the central stellar mass surface density within a radius of 1 kpc (Σ1) was thus suggested to be closely related to galaxy quenching. Massive star-forming galaxies with high Σ1 do not fit into this picture. To understand the origin of such galaxies, we compare the spatially resolved stellar population and star formation properties of massive (>1010.5M⊙) blue spiral galaxies with high and low Σ1, divided by Σ1 = 109.4M⊙ kpc−2, based on the final release of MaNGA integral field unit data. We find that both high-Σ1 and low-Σ1 blue spirals show large diversities in stellar population and star formation properties. Despite the diversities, high-Σ1 blue spirals are statistically different from the low-Σ1 ones. Specifically, the radial profiles of the luminosity-weighted age and Mgb/〈Fe〉 show that high-Σ1 blue spirals consist of a larger fraction of galaxies with younger and less α-element-enhanced centers than their low-Σ1 counterparts, ∼55% versus ∼30%. The galaxies with younger centers mostly have higher central specific star formation rates, which still follow the spaxel-based star formation main-sequence relation. Examinations of the Hα velocity field and the optical structures suggest that galactic bars or galaxy interactions should be responsible for the rejuvenation of these galaxies. The remaining ∼45% of high-Σ1 blue spirals are consistent with the inside-out growth scenario.

该研究扩展了对球状星团内部恒星的累积径向分布形状参数的探究，采用了大量的蒙特卡洛模拟球状星团的数据。通过对13亿年时不同演化阶段的模型进行分析，研究发现这三个形状参数可以有效区分处于早期动力学演化阶段的系统和已经经历了核心崩缩的系统。此外，这些参数还有助于区分宿主低质量中等质量黑洞的星团和中心拥有大量暗物质残留的星团。相对于其他动力学指标，这些形状参数的优势在于它们是完全经验性的，并且更容易从观测数据中测量。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究通过模拟球状星团的数据，发现了三个形状参数可用于区分星团的动力学演化阶段，以及区分不同类型的星团。这些参数的经验性特点使其更易于观测数据的测量和分析。 <div>
We recently introduced three new parameters that describe the shape of the normalized cumulative radial distribution (nCRD) of the innermost stars in globular clusters (GCs) and trace the clusters’ dynamical evolution. Here, we extend our previous investigations to the case of a large set of Monte Carlo simulations of GCs, started from a broad range of initial conditions. All the models are analyzed at the same age of 13 Gyr when they have reached different evolutionary phases. The sample of models is well representative of the structural properties of the observed population of Galactic GCs. We confirm that the three nCRD parameters are powerful tools to distinguish systems in the early stages of dynamical evolution from those that have already experienced core collapse. They might also help disentangle clusters hosting a low-mass intermediate-mass black hole of a few hundred solar masses from cases with large concentrations of dark remnants in their centers. With respect to other dynamical indicators, the nCRD parameters offer the advantage of being fully empirical and easier to measure from observational data.

<br /><br />总结:
研究利用哈勃太空望远镜对年轻银河开放星团NGC 3293中的8颗早期B星进行了硼丰度或上限的测定，现在该星团中有18颗早期B星的硼测量数据。新观测到的六颗旋转速度大于200 km/s，为主序星旋转混合提供了新的约束。研究发现，大部分样本星符合预测的旋转速度与质量或光度增大时硼耗尽加剧的趋势，表明较小的旋转混合效率。而五颗旋转较慢的星显示出比旋转混合预期更大的硼耗尽，推测这些星可能源自双星合并。 <div>
New boron abundances or upper limits have been determined for eight early B stars in the young Galactic open cluster NGC 3293, using UV spectra obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph. With previous observations, there are now 18 early B stars in this cluster with boron measurements. Six of the newly observed stars have projected rotational velocities greater than 200 km s−1, allowing new constraints on rotationally driven mixing in main-sequence stars. When comparing to synthetic model populations, we find that the majority of our sample stars agree well with the predicted trends of stronger boron depletion for larger rotation and for larger mass or luminosity. Based on those, a smaller than the canonical rotational mixing efficiency (fc ≈ 0.0165 versus the more standard value of 0.033) appears to be favored. In addition, the five mostly slowly rotating stars, when considered as a group, tend to show more boron depletion than expected from rotational mixing, and we speculate that most or all of these originate from binary mergers.

本文研究了磁星驱动的超新星的多样化光学曲线，考虑了自旋减速由重力波辐射和/或磁偶极辐射主导的情况。通过模拟超新星的光学曲线并使用马尔科夫链蒙特卡罗方法，限制了磁星和超新星爆炸的参数，并表明重力波辐射的特征可能在超新星Ic-BL 2007ru和2009bb的全波光度曲线中得到体现。研究发现，磁场约10^16 G可以导致磁星的偏心率约为10^-3。如果未来可以通过先进的LIGO和Virgo探测器探测到与超新星相关的连续重力波，这将成为磁星引擎驱动超新星的确凿证据。<br /><br /> <div>
Rapidly spinning magnetars are potential candidates for the energy source of supernovae (SNe) and gamma-ray bursts and the most promising sources for continuous gravitational waves (GWs) detected by ground-based GW detectors. Continuous GWs can be radiated from magnetars due to magnetic-induced deformation or fluid oscillations, compatible with magnetic dipole (MD) radiation for spin-down energy. In this paper, we investigate the diverse light curves of magnetar-driven SNe in the scenario that the spin-down is dominated by GW radiation and/or MD radiation. By simulating the light curves of SNe and employing the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we constrain the parameters of the magnetars and SN explosions and show that the signature of GW radiation may be indicated by the bolometric luminosity curves of SNe Ic-BL 2007ru and 2009bb. We find that the ellipticity of magnetars in the order of 10−3 can be induced by the magnetic field of ∼1016 G. If such continuous GWs associated with SNe can be detected in the future by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors, this would be a smoking gun for a magnetar engine powering SNe.

总结:<br />
磁场可能在巨大恒星和星团形成的初期条件中起着至关重要的作用。研究人员使用了SOFIA-HAWC+ 214 μm观测偏振热尘埃辐射和高分辨率GBT-Argus C18O(1-0)观测，得出了对质量星际暗云G28.37+0.07磁场强度的地图。研究表明，这些区域的磁场在调节崩缩过程中起着主导作用，而且与密度梯度方向呈明显一致。但是，原恒星的喷流方向与磁场方向没有明显的偏好。这些结果表明磁场在调节巨大恒星和星团形成过程中起着至关重要的作用，因此在理论模型中必须考虑磁场的作用。 <div>
Magnetic fields may play a crucial role in setting the initial conditions of massive star and star cluster formation. To investigate this, we report SOFIA-HAWC+ 214 μm observations of polarized thermal dust emission and high-resolution GBT-Argus C18O(1-0) observations toward the massive Infrared Dark Cloud (IRDC) G28.37+0.07. Considering the local dispersion of B-field orientations, we produce a map of the B-field strength of the IRDC, which exhibits values between ∼0.03 and 1 mG based on a refined Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi method proposed by Skalidis & Tassis. Comparing to a map of inferred density, the IRDC exhibits a B–n relation with a power-law index of 0.51 ± 0.02, which is consistent with a scenario of magnetically regulated anisotropic collapse. Consideration of the mass-to-flux ratio map indicates that magnetic fields are dynamically important in most regions of the IRDC. A virial analysis of a sample of massive, dense cores in the IRDC, including evaluation of magnetic and kinetic internal and surface terms, indicates consistency with virial equilibrium, sub-Alfvénic conditions, and a dominant role for B-fields in regulating collapse. A clear alignment of magnetic field morphology with the direction of the steepest column density gradient is also detected. However, there is no preferred orientation of protostellar outflow directions with the B-field. Overall, these results indicate that magnetic fields play a crucial role in regulating massive star and star cluster formation, and therefore they need to be accounted for in theoretical models of these processes.

<div> 关键词: HFSs, G6.55-0.1, 星团形成, CO和射电连续波, 重力坍缩

总结:
本研究通过射电连续波和CO分子的观测，研究了与G6.55-0.1相关的Hub-filament系统(HFSs)。射电连续波图显示了多个峰值，与远红外尘埃连续波峰值重合，表明在HFSs的中心存在多个年轻的大质量恒星。通过C18O(2–1)地图得到的速度信息，确定了G6.55-0.1与超新星遗迹W28无物理联系，并识别了与G6.55-0.1真正相关的速度组分。结果显示，13.8和17.3 km/s处的两个纤维丝 contribute a total mass accretion rate of 3000 M⊙ Myr−1 to the hub。这两个纤维丝的速度剖面显示了V字形结构，表明了其重力坍缩的特征。研究还发现，纤维丝的单位长度质量小于由平衡考虑得出的临界线密度，这表明纤维丝并非整体重力坍缩，尽管其内部清晰地显示了年轻的恒星形成核心。观测到的速度梯度与从质量和尺寸估算出的主源的重力坍缩一致。 <div>
Hub–filament systems (HFSs) being the potential sites of formation of star clusters and high-mass stars, provide a testbed for the current theories that attempt to explain star formation globally. It is thus important to study a large number of HFSs using both intensity and velocity information to constrain these objects better observationally. Here, we present a study of the HFS associated with G6.55-0.1 using newly obtained observations of the radio continuum and the J = 2–1 transition of CO, 13CO, and C18O. The radio continuum maps show multiple peaks that coincide with far-infrared dust continuum peaks, indicating the presence of more than one young massive star in the hub of the HFS. We used the velocity information from the C18O(2–1) map to (a) show that the source G6.55-0.1 is not physically associated with the supernova remnant W28 and (b) disentangle and identify the velocity components genuinely associated with G6.55-0.1. Among the velocity-coherent structures identified in the region, we conclude that only the two filaments at 13.8 and 17.3 km s−1 contribute a total mass accretion rate of 3000 M⊙ Myr−1 to the hub. Both the filaments also show a V-shaped structure, characteristic of gravitational collapse, in their velocity profile at the location of the hub. The estimated mass per unit length of the segments of the filaments is smaller than the critical line masses derived from virial equilibrium considerations. This suggests that the filaments are not gravitationally collapsing as a whole, although their inner parts clearly show evidence of collapse in the form of young star-forming cores. We further conclude that the observed velocity gradients are consistent with the gravitational collapse of the main source in the region as estimated from its mass and size.

本文研究了太阳风湍流中等能量范围和惯性范围内等离子体密度涨落的各向异性问题。研究发现，在几乎所有速度范围内，密度相关尺度在准平行于大尺度平均磁场方向时略大于准垂直方向。其中，在小的相关水平上，如能量含量尺度及更大尺度上，快速风中密度涨落接近各向同性，而慢速和中速风则略倾向于更快的垂直方向相关消失。而在较小的惯性范围内，密度涨落的各向异性方向在所有速度范围内都是相反的，尤其在快速风样本中更加明显。与已发表的速度和磁场相关结果相对比，表明了不同的发现。 <div>
A well-known property of solar wind plasma turbulence is the observed anisotropy of the autocorrelations, or equivalently the spectra, of velocity and magnetic field fluctuations. Here we explore the related but apparently not well-studied issue of the anisotropy of plasma density fluctuations in the energy-containing and inertial ranges of solar wind turbulence. Using 10 yr (1998–2008) of in situ data from the Advanced Composition Explorer mission, we find that for all but the fastest wind category, the density correlation scale is slightly larger in directions quasi-parallel to the large-scale mean magnetic field as compared to quasi-perpendicular directions. The correlation scale in fast wind is consistent with isotropic. The anisotropy as a function of the level of correlation is also explored. We find at small correlation levels, i.e., at energy-containing scales and larger, the density fluctuations are close to isotropy for fast wind, and slightly favor more rapid decorrelation in perpendicular directions for slow and medium winds. At relatively smaller (inertial range) scales where the correlation values are larger, the sense of anisotropy is reversed in all speed ranges, implying a more “slablike” structure, especially prominent in the fast wind samples. We contrast this finding with published results on velocity and magnetic field correlations.

总结:
该研究报告了在标准宇宙学模型预测的暗物质晕的质量函数和存在于明亮的高红移星系之间存在紧张关系。研究提出了一种改进的测试方法，利用高红移巴尔默跃迁来探测早期104-105M⊙的重子迷你暗物质晕的形成。与先前的测试不同，这不依赖于质量与光度比，并且仅在很小程度上依赖于金属丰度、恒星初始质量函数和星形成历史，这些在高红移处的约束都较弱。研究表明，在最简单的ΛCDM宇宙学模型下，允许在z=9时的最强巴尔默跃迁的D4000约为1.26，在包括真实反馈模型的情况下D4000≤1.14。由于当前对JWST源的光度学模板拟合推断出在z≳11时存在更强的巴尔默跃迁，即将进行的光谱学后续研究将证明这些模板在高红移处无效，或者暗示“纯正”ΛCDM之外的新物理。 <div>
Recent studies have reported tension between the presence of luminous, high-redshift galaxies and the halo mass functions predicted by standard cosmology. Here, an improved test is proposed using the presence of high-redshift Balmer breaks to probe the formation of early 104–105M⊙ baryonic minihalos. Unlike previous tests, this does not depend upon the mass-to-light ratio and has only a slight dependence upon the metallicity, stellar initial mass function, and star formation history, which are all weakly constrained at high redshift. We show that the strongest Balmer breaks allowed at z = 9 using the simplest ΛCDM cosmological model would allow a D4000 as high as 1.26 under idealized circumstances and D4000 ≤ 1.14 including realistic feedback models. Since current photometric template fitting to JWST sources infers the existence of stronger Balmer breaks out to z ≳ 11, upcoming spectroscopic follow-up will either demonstrate those templates are invalid at high redshift or imply new physics beyond “vanilla” ΛCDM.

We present the first on-sky segmented primary mirror closed-loop piston control using a Zernike wavefront sensor (ZWFS) installed on the Keck II telescope. Segment cophasing errors are a primary contributor to contrast limits on Keck and will be necessary to correct for the next generation of space missions and ground-based extremely large telescopes, which will all have segmented primary mirrors. The goal of the ZWFS installed on Keck is to monitor and correct primary mirror cophasing errors in parallel with science observations. The ZWFS is ideal for measuring phase discontinuities such as segment cophasing errors and is one of the most sensitive WFSs, but has limited dynamic range. The vector-ZWFS at Keck works on the adaptive-optics-corrected wavefront and consists of a metasurface focal plane mask that imposes two different phase shifts on the core of the point-spread function to two orthogonal light polarizations, producing two pupil images. This design extends the dynamic range compared with the scalar ZWFS. The primary mirror segment pistons were controlled in closed loop using the ZWFS, improving the Strehl ratio on the NIRC2 science camera by up to 10 percentage points. We analyze the performance of the closed-loop tests, the impact on NIRC2 science data, and discuss the ZWFS measurements.

<br />
通过使用Large Array Survey Telescope (LAST)进行观测，独立探测长时间伽马射线暴 (GRBs) 的早期光学发射。该方法利用小型光学望远镜组成的阵列，可以扫描广泛的天空区域，并在需要时集中于较小的视场以提高灵敏度。阵列的模块化结构便于快速切换望远镜指向，从而显著增加了对短时间尺度内盲目调查的有效天空覆盖面积。通过对伽马射线对应事件的早期数据的补充，可以为高能观测提供宝贵的信息。即使没有伽马射线关联，探测也可能用于探索与GRBs相关的各种现象，如孤立余辉、污染火球和窒息喷流。我们模拟了一组GRBs及其早期光学信号，考虑动态采样率后，将光变曲线输入到一个机器学习分类器中，用于识别天文现象。通过将LAST阵列的一半用于盲目搜索，预计每年可以独立检测7-11个GRBs，相当于每年大约0.12deg-2的内在事件率。
<br /><br />总结: 通过使用LAST阵列，可以探测到GRBs的早期光学发射。这种方法利用小型望远镜阵列的模块化结构，可以对天空进行快速高效的观测，为GRBs研究提供了新的途径。模拟结果表明，采用机器学习分类器的方法可以识别并独立检测出GRBs，并为研究员提供有价值的数据。 <div>
We present an observational approach for the independent detection of the early optical emission of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). For this purpose, we explore the potential of the Large Array Survey Telescope (LAST). This array of small optical telescopes can be used to scan a wide region of the sky, and to focus on a smaller field of view with increased sensitivity, as needed. The modularity of the array facilitates dynamic scanning of multiple fields, by shifting telescope pointing directions with high cadence. This can significantly increase the effective sky-coverage of a blind survey on short timescales. For events associated with gamma-ray counterparts, the valuable early time data can supplement high-energy observations. Regardless of gamma-ray association, detections can potentially be used to explore various phenomena associated with GRBs, such as orphan afterglows; dirty fireballs; and choked jets. We simulate a sample of GRBs and their respective optical signals at early times. After accounting for dynamic cadence, the light curves are given as input to a machine-learning classifier, used to identify astrophysical transients. We find that, by dedicating half of an LAST array to a blind search, one would expect to independently detect 7–11 GRBs yr–1, corresponding to an approximate intrinsic event rate of 0.12 deg–2 yr–1.

SAUNAS是一个用于检测Chandra X-ray Observatory的ACIS数据中弥散X射线辐射的流程。它通过查询Chandra档案中的观察数据，并进行光度校准、点扩散函数建模和反卷积、点源去除、自适应平滑和背景校正等步骤。SAUNAS通过多个质量性能测试来表征其性能，并利用两个已知显示X射线发射结构的星系展示了SAUNAS的广泛应用和能力。SAUNAS成功检测到NGC 3079的30 kpc X射线超风，并在UGC 5101的领域中发现了一个扩展的低表面亮度源。SAUNAS证明了其在Chandra/ACIS的档案数据中恢复先前未检测到的结构的能力，扩展了对低表面亮度X射线宇宙的探索。<br /><br />总结: Chandra X-ray Observatory 的 SAUNAS 流程能够检测到弥散 X 射线辐射，同时具有良好的性能，并成功在两个星系中检测到 X 射线发射结构。 <div>
We present Selective Amplification of Ultra Noisy Astronomical Signal (SAUNAS), a pipeline designed for detecting diffuse X-ray emission in the data obtained with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) of the Chandra X-ray Observatory. SAUNAS queries the available observations in the Chandra archive and performs photometric calibration, point-spread function modeling and deconvolution, point-source removal, adaptive smoothing, and background correction. This pipeline builds on existing and well-tested software including CIAO, VorBin, and LIRA. We characterize the performance of SAUNAS through several quality performance tests and demonstrate the broad applications and capabilities of SAUNAS using two galaxies already known to show X-ray-emitting structures. SAUNAS successfully detects the 30 kpc X-ray superwind of NGC 3079 using Chandra/ACIS data sets, matching the spatial distribution detected with more sensitive XMM-Newton observations. The analysis performed by SAUNAS reveals an extended low surface brightness source in the field of UGC 5101 in the 0.3–1.0 keV and 1.0–2.0 keV bands. This source is potentially a background galaxy cluster or a hot gas plume associated with UGC 5101. SAUNAS demonstrates its ability to recover previously undetected structures in archival data, expanding exploration into the low surface brightness X-ray Universe with Chandra/ACIS.

<div> HH46 IRS, JWST,  spectroscopy, outflow, shock-excited

JWST 的 PROJECT-J 计划使用 NIRSpec 和 MIRI 光谱技术研究了 HH46 IRS 和其流出物。数据显示了前所未有的射线、分子流和空腔细节。首次探测到源头附近约90天文单位处的红移射流。观测到了数十条受激禁忌线，包括[Ne iii] 15.5 μm等高度电离的物质，表明气体受到高速冲击（>80 km/s）在相对高密度介质中的激发。H2线的图像展示了复杂的分子流动，明亮的空腔、分子壳和喷流驱动的弓形冲击与周围条件相互作用并受其塑造。NIRCam 2 μm 图像解析了 HH46 IRS 大约110天文单位的二元系统，并表明在射流和H2广角发射之间观察到的巨大不对称可能是由两个不同的喷流驱动的。未解析二元系统的光谱显示深的冰带和吸收中的大量气体线，可能源自冷包层或盘。总之，JWST 首次揭示了 HH46 IRS 复杂的流出物的起源，证明了其对于研究年轻恒星周围的嵌入区域，即使在近红外波长下依然神秘的能力。<br /><br />总结: <div>
We present the first results of the JWST program PROJECT-J (PROtostellar JEts Cradle Tested with JWST), designed to study the Class I source HH46 IRS and its outflow through NIRSpec and MIRI spectroscopy (1.66–28 μm). The data provide line images (∼6.″6 in length with NIRSpec, and up to ∼20″ with MIRI) revealing unprecedented details within the jet, the molecular outflow, and the cavity. We detect, for the first time, the redshifted jet within ∼90 au from the source. Dozens of shock-excited forbidden lines are observed, including highly ionized species such as [Ne iii] 15.5 μm, suggesting that the gas is excited by high velocity (>80 km s−1) shocks in a relatively high-density medium. Images of H2 lines at different excitations outline a complex molecular flow, where a bright cavity, molecular shells, and a jet-driven bow shock interact with and are shaped by the ambient conditions. Additional NIRCam 2 μm images resolve the HH46 IRS ∼110 au binary system and suggest that the large asymmetries observed between the jet and the H2 wide-angle emission could be due to two separate outflows being driven by the two sources. The spectra of the unresolved binary show deep ice bands and plenty of gaseous lines in absorption, likely originating in a cold envelope or disk. In conclusion, JWST has unraveled for the first time the origin of the HH46 IRS complex outflow demonstrating its capability to investigate embedded regions around young stars, which remain elusive even at near-IR wavelengths.

<title>Fallback Rates in Partial Tidal Disruptions of White Dwarfs by Intermediate-mass Black Holes</title>

<div> 部分潮汐破坏，中间质量黑洞，平滑粒子流体动力学，回落率，恒星残骸

这篇论文利用平滑粒子流体动力学方法，对恒星部分潮汐破坏后的回落现象进行了全面的数值分析。研究了单个太阳质量的白矮星在抛物线轨道上被一个质量为103太阳质量的非自旋中间质量黑洞部分潮汐破坏的数值模拟，并确定了碎片回落到黑洞内的核心质量分数和回落率。对于超大质量黑洞，在完全破坏过程中，已知延迟时间的回落率遵循t−5/3的幂律，而近期有推测称部分潮汐破坏的回落率在后期会饱和为更陡的t−9/4幂律，与遗留的核心质量无关。然而，本文表明，对于中间质量黑洞，部分破坏显著改变了这一结论。也就是说，后期的回落率并不会渐近于t−9/4的幂律，而且这一率还强烈依赖于核心质量。我们推导了一个关于后期回落率的稳健公式，作为核心质量分数的函数，与白矮星的质量无关，我们通过对其进行多次数值验证进行了验证。 <br /><br />总结: 本文利用平滑粒子流体动力学方法对中间质量黑洞部分潮汐破坏后的回落现象进行了数值分析，并发现后期的回落率不会趋近于t−9/4的幂律，且这一率也极大地依赖于核心质量。研究结果对进一步理解中间质量黑洞的特征具有重要意义。 <div>
The fallback rate of debris after the partial tidal disruption of a star by an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) might provide important signatures of such black holes rather than supermassive ones. Here using smoothed particle hydrodynamics methods, we provide a comprehensive numerical analysis of this phenomenon. We perform numerical simulations of single partial tidal disruptions of solar-mass white dwarfs in parabolic orbits, with a nonspinning 103 M⊙ IMBH for various values of the impact parameter, and determine the core mass fractions and fallback rates of debris into the IMBH. For supermassive black holes, in full disruption processes, it is known that the late-time fallback rate follows a power law t−5/3, whereas for partial disruptions, such a rate has recently been conjectured to saturate at a steeper power law t−9/4, independent of the mass of the remnant core. We show here that for IMBHs, partial disruptions significantly alter this conclusion. That is, the fallback rate at late times does not asymptote to a t−9/4 power law, and this rate is also a strong function of the core mass. We derive a robust formula for the late-time fallback rate as a function of the core mass fraction, which is independent of the mass of the white dwarf, as we verify numerically by varying it.

White dwarf stars are ubiquitous in the Galaxy, and are essential to understanding stellar evolution. While most white dwarfs are photometrically stable and reliable flux standards, some can be highly variable, which can reveal unique details about the endpoints of low-mass stellar evolution. In this study, we characterize a sample of high-confidence white dwarfs with multi-epoch photometry from Gaia Data Release 3. We compare these Gaia light curves with light curves from the Zwicky Transiting Facility and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite to see when Gaia data independently can accurately measure periods of variability. From this sample, 105 objects have variability periods measured from the Gaia light curves independently, with periods as long as roughly 9.5 days and as short as 256.2 s (roughly 4 minutes), including seven systems with periods shorter than 1000 s. We discover 86 new objects from the 105 target samples, including pulsating, spotted, and binary white dwarfs, and even a new 68.4 minute eclipsing cataclysmic variable. The median amplitude of the absolute photometric variability we confirm from Gaia independently is 1.4%, demonstrating that Gaia epoch photometry is capable of measuring short-term periods even when observations are sparse.

这篇文章利用哈勃太空望远镜成像数据对四个超微型矮星系进行了低质量恒星初始质量函数(IMF)的研究。研究采用了Kolmogorov-Smirnov检验来确定观测到的明度分布是否能够排除给定的IMF参数和二元分数。针对Reticulum II和Ursa Major II两个系统还确定了最佳拟合参数值，并发现Reticulum II的IMF与银河系的类似，而Ursa Major II的IMF更偏重底部。但Ursa Major II的结果可能存在来自两个已知背景星系团的污染。总结:本研究利用哈勃太空望远镜数据对超微型矮星系进行了低质量恒星初始质量函数(IMF)的研究，发现这些星系排除了多种IMF，未能排除的IMF与银河系的相似。对Reticulum II和Ursa Major II两个系统确定了最佳拟合参数值，但Ursa Major II的结果可能存在污染。 <div>
The stellar initial mass function (IMF) describes the distribution of stellar masses that form in a given star formation event. The long main-sequence lifetimes of low-mass stars mean that the IMF in this regime (below ∼ 1 M⊙) can be investigated through star counts. Ultrafaint dwarf galaxies are low-luminosity systems with ancient, metal-poor stellar populations. We investigate the low-mass IMF in four such systems (Reticulum II, Ursa Major II, Triangulum II, and Segue 1), using Hubble Space Telescope imaging data that reaches to ≲ 0.2 M⊙ in each galaxy. The analysis techniques that we adopt depend on the number of low-mass stars in each sample. We use Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests for all four galaxies to determine whether their observed apparent magnitude distributions can reject a given combination of IMF parameters and binary fraction for the underlying population. We forward model 1000 synthetic populations for each combination of parameters, and reject those parameters only if each of the 1000 realizations reject the null hypothesis. We find that all four galaxies reject a variety of IMFs, and the IMFs that they cannot reject include those that are identical, or similar, to that of the stellar populations of the Milky Way. We determine the best-fit parameter values for the IMF in Reticulum II and Ursa Major II and find that the IMF in Reticulum II is generally consistent with that of the Milky Way, while the IMF in Ursa Major II is more bottom heavy. The interpretation of the results for Ursa Major II is complicated by possible contamination from two known background galaxy clusters.

总结:<br />
该研究对银河中心的Sgr B2北部进行了映射研究，首次在84 GHz检测到了Class I 甲醇(CH3OH)激光以及首次对5.29 GHz的甲醛(CH2NH)激光进行了干涉图。使用非LTE辐射传输模型和马尔可夫蒙特卡洛方法进行贝叶斯分析，以定量评估观察到的光谱轮廓。结果表明，对于低连续背景辐射区域，采用两链块模型来解释强烈的CH3OH Class I激光辐射。通过比较几种分子物种的激光辐射的空间起源和范围，发现5.29 GHz的CH2NH激光与84 GHz的CH3OH Class I激光有密切的空间关系，这提供了观测证据，暗示了这些激光跃迁具有相似的碰撞泵浦机制。 <div>
At centimeter wavelengths, single-dish observations have suggested that the Sagittarius (Sgr) B2 molecular cloud at the Galactic Center hosts weak maser emission from several organic molecules, including CH2NH, HNCNH, and HCOOCH3. However, the lack of spatial distribution information on these new maser species has prevented us from assessing the excitation conditions of the maser emission as well as their pumping mechanisms. Here, we present a mapping study toward Sgr B2 north (N) to locate the region where the complex maser emission originates. We report the first detection of the Class I methanol (CH3OH) maser at 84 GHz and the first interferometric map of the methanimine (CH2NH) maser at 5.29 GHz toward this region. In addition, we present a tool for modeling and fitting the unsaturated molecular maser signals with non-LTE radiative transfer models and Bayesian analysis using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. These enable us to quantitatively assess the observed spectral profiles. The results suggest a two-chain-clump model for explaining the intense CH3OH Class I maser emission toward a region with low continuum background radiation. By comparing the spatial origin and extent of maser emission from several molecular species, we find that the 5.29 GHz CH2NH maser has a close spatial relationship with the 84 GHz CH3OH Class I masers. This relationship serves as observational evidence to suggest a similar collisional pumping mechanism for these maser transitions.

总结:
本文研究了行星如何随着温度和旋转率的变化而改变大小。研究表明，行星的半径主要取决于表面密度、重力和表面不可压缩性。小行星的半径会随温度变化而变化，而大行星则不会受到温度的影响。同样地，行星的半径还会受到其旋转率的影响。综合来看，地球和类地行星的半径在温度和旋转率方面处于一个中等状态。 <div>
Condensed planets contract or expand as their temperature changes. With the exception of the effect of phase changes, this phenomenon is generally interpreted as being solely related to the thermal expansivity of the planet’s components. However, changes in density affect pressure and gravity and, consequently, the planet’s compressibility. A planet’s radius is also linked to its rate of rotation. Here again, changes in pressure, gravity, and compressibility are coupled. In this article we clarify how the radius of a condensed planet changes with temperature and rotation, using a simple and rigorous thermodynamic model. We consider condensed materials to obey a simple equation of state which generalizes a polytopic EoS as temperature varies. Using this equation, we build simple models of condensed planet’s interiors including exoplanets, derive their mass–radius relationships, and study the dependence of their radius on temperature and rotation rate. We show that it depends crucially on the value of ρsgR/Ks (ρs being surface density, g gravity, R radius, Ks surface incompressibility). This nondimensional number is also the ratio of the dissipation number which appears in compressible convection and the Gruneïsen mineralogic parameter. While the radius of small planets depends on temperature, this is not the case for large planets with large dissipation numbers; Earth and a super-Earth like CoRoT-7b are in something of an intermediate state, with a moderately temperature-dependent radius. Similarly, while the radius of these two planets is a function of their rotation rates, this is not the case for smaller or larger planets.

Full-disk spectroscopic observations of the solar corona are highly desired to forecast solar eruptions and their impact on planets and to uncover the origin of solar wind. In this paper, we introduce a new multislit design (five slits) to obtain extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) spectra simultaneously. The selected spectrometer wavelength range (184–197 Å) contains several bright EUV lines that can be used for spectral diagnostics. The multislit approach offers an unprecedented way to efficiently obtain the global spectral data but the ambiguity from different slits should be resolved. Using a numerical simulation of the global corona, we primarily concentrate on the optimization of the disambiguation process, with the objective of extracting decomposed spectral information of six primary lines. This subsequently facilitates a comprehensive series of plasma diagnostics, including density (Fe xii 195.12/186.89 Å), Doppler velocity (Fe xii 193.51 Å), line width (Fe xii 193.51 Å), and temperature diagnostics (Fe viii 185.21 Å, Fe x 184.54 Å, Fe xi 188.22 Å, and Fe xii 193.51 Å). We find a good agreement between the forward modeling parameters and the inverted results at the initial eruption stage of a coronal mass ejection, indicating the robustness of the decomposition method and its immense potential for global monitoring of the solar corona.

<title>Discovery and Characterization of Two Ultrafaint Dwarfs outside the Halo of the Milky Way: Leo M and Leo K</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the discovery of two ultrafaint dwarf galaxies, Leo M and Leo K, that lie outside the halo of the Milky Way (MW). Using Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the resolved stars, we create color–magnitude diagrams reaching the oldest main-sequence turnoff of each system and (i) fit for structural parameters of the galaxies; (ii) measure their distances using the luminosity of the horizontal branch stars; (iii) estimate integrated magnitudes and stellar masses; and (iv) reconstruct the star formation histories. Based on their location in the Local Group, neither galaxy is currently within the halo of the MW although Leo K is located ∼26 kpc from the low-mass galaxy Leo T and these two systems may have had a past interaction. Leo M and Leo K have stellar masses of M⊙ and 1.2 ± 0.2 × 104M⊙, and were quenched Gyr and Gyr ago, respectively. Given that the galaxies are at farther distances from the MW, it is unlikely that they were quenched by environmental processing. Instead, given their low stellar masses, their early quenching timescales are consistent with the scenario that a combination of reionization and stellar feedback shut down star formation at early cosmic times.

<title>Is the Compact Object Associated with HESS J1731-347 a Strange Quark Star? A Possible Astrophysical Scenario for Its Formation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The analysis of the central compact object within the supernova (SN) remnant HESS J1731-347 suggests that it has a small radius and, even more interestingly, a mass of the order or smaller than 1 M⊙. This raises the question of which astrophysical process could lead to such a small mass, since the analysis of various types of SN explosions indicate that is it not possible to produce a neutron star with a mass smaller than about 1.17 M⊙. Here we show that masses of the order or smaller than 1 M⊙ can be obtained in the case of strange quark stars and that it is possible to build a coherent model explaining not only the mass and the radius of that object, but also its slow cooling suggested in various analyses. We also show that an astrophysical path exists, which leads to the formation of such an object, and we discuss the role played in that scenario by strangelets assumed to constitute the dark matter.

<title>High Mass Inner Regions Found in Five Outbursting Sources</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Young stellar objects are thought to commonly undergo sudden accretion events that result in a rise in bolometric luminosity. These outbursts likely coincide with the onset of planet formation and could impact the formation of planets. The reason behind this dramatic enhancement of accretion is an active area of research, and the mass of the system is a critical parameter. Using the Northern Extended Millimeter Array, we survey five outbursting sources (three FU Ori, one EX Or, and one “peculiar” source) with the primary goal of determining the system’s mass using an optically thin line of CO. We estimate the mass of a central region for each object that using both continuum emission and C17O J = 2-1. The C17O emission likely includes both disk and inner envelope material, thus acts as an upper limit on the disk mass, ranging from 0.33 to 3.4 M⊙ for our sources. These derived masses suggest that the inner ∼1000 au contains enough mass along the line of sight for these sources to be gravitationally unstable.

总结: 本文研究了原行星盘（CPD）和行星的辐射对盘温度的影响，并进行了合成预测。通过水动力学模拟和辐射传递后处理，作者发现在大多数情况下，CPD和行星的辐射可以局部增加盘温度，且可能在毫米波辐射中产生可检测的特征。此外，CPD的存在还可以产生对连续光谱减法重要的方位不对称性。因此，结合局部尘埃气体比和吸积速率的综合分析，对原行星在其他波长的检测限制了它们的生长时间尺度。 <br /><br /> <div>
The discovery of protoplanets and circumplanetary disks provides a unique opportunity to characterize planet formation through observations. Massive protoplanets shape the physical and chemical structure of their host circumstellar disk by accretion, localized emission, and disk depletion. In this work, we study the thermal changes induced within the disk by protoplanet accretion and synthetic predictions through hydrodynamical simulations with postprocessed radiative transfer with an emphasis on radio millimeter emission. We explored distinct growth conditions and varied both planetary accretion rates and the local dust-to-gas mass ratios for a protoplanet at 1200 K. The radiative transfer models show that beyond the effect of disk gaps, in most cases, the circumplanetary disk (CPD) and the planet’s emission locally increase the disk temperature. Moreover, depending on the local dust-to-gas depletion and accretion rate, the presence of the CPD may have detectable signatures in millimeter emission. It also has the power to generate azimuthal asymmetries that are important for continuum subtraction. Thus, if other means of detection of protoplanets are proven, the lack of corresponding evidence at other wavelengths can set limits on their growth timescales through a combined analysis of the local dust-to-gas ratio and the accretion rate.

<div> 关键词：太阳活动周期，全球振荡模式，日震环图法，近表面剪切层，地球物理研究<br />
<br />总结:
本研究利用全球振荡模式分裂获取太阳近表面剪切层的旋转梯度，以了解太阳活动周期和地球船的动力学。在分析中发现，日震环图法能够提供高分辨率的结果，相较于全球振荡模式分裂。然而，默认参数会限制近表面梯度的准确性。作者通过拟合每个位置一年平均的功率谱，再进行12年平均的方法来解决这一挑战。结果显示，近表面剪切层可以分为三个明显的区域：深层、大范围、梯度逐渐加剧；狭窄的中间层，梯度大约是前者的3倍；接近表面的层，对数梯度接近零，但在向表面变得更陡。此外，研究还揭示了经度对梯度的差异以及东西方的对称成分。 <div>
The gradient of rotation in the near-surface shear layer (NSSL) of the Sun provides valuable insights into the dynamics associated with the solar activity cycle and the dynamo. Results obtained with global oscillation mode splittings lack resolution near the surface, prompting the use of the local helioseismic ring-diagram method. While the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager ring-analysis pipeline has been used previously for analyzing this layer, default pipeline parameters limit the accuracy of the near-surface gradients. To address these challenges, we fitted the flow parameters to power spectra averaged over one-year periods at each location, followed by additional averaging over 12 yr. We find that the NSSL can be divided into three fairly distinct regions: a deeper, larger region with a small shear, steepening toward the surface; a narrow middle layer with a strong shear, with a gradient approximately 3 times larger; and a layer very close to the surface, where the logarithmic gradient is close to zero but becomes steeper again toward the surface. The middle layer appears to be centered at 3 Mm, but the poor resolution in these layers implies that it is potentially located closer to the surface, around 1.5 Mm deep. While our analysis primarily focused on regions along the central meridian, we also investigated systematic errors at longitudes off the center. The east–west antisymmetric component of the gradient reveals a layer of substantial differences between the east and west longitude of around 1.7 Mm, and the amplitude of the differences increases with the longitude.

总结: <br />
引入引力波天文学使得我们能够研究宇宙中紧凑双星合并现象，这有助于理解恒星、它们所处的环境以及演化过程。目前，我们活跃地探讨的一个问题是紧凑双星形成的本质：促成黑洞诞生所需的环境和化学条件，以及双星合并前经历的时间延迟。然而，由于当前干涉仪的灵敏度限制，如今探测到的引力波事件主要发生在低或中红移处，限制了我们探测这些数量在高红移处的行为能力。为此，本文利用了另一种信息源：观测限制了远古宇宙中未解析双星引力波背景。利用来自LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA的前三次观测运行的引力波数据，我们将直接探测到的双星目录和对未解析背景的限制结合起来，以限制双黑洞演化的时间延迟分布和金属丰度的依赖性。同时，我们也探讨了这些约束在Advanced LIGO A+灵敏度下如何改善。尽管今天的数据无法强力约束双黑洞的形成方式，但Advanced LIGO A+未来对引力波背景的探测（或未探测）将对双黑洞的演化带来重大影响。 <div>
The advent of gravitational-wave astronomy is now allowing for the study of compact binary merger demographics throughout the Universe. This information can be leveraged as tools for understanding massive stars, their environments, and their evolution. One active question is the nature of compact binary formation: the environmental and chemical conditions required for black hole birth and the time delays experienced by binaries before they merge. Gravitational-wave events detected today, however, primarily occur at low or moderate redshifts due to current interferometer sensitivity, therefore limiting our ability to probe the high-redshift behavior of these quantities. In this work, we circumvent this limitation by using an additional source of information: observational limits on the gravitational-wave background from unresolved binaries in the distant Universe. Using current gravitational-wave data from the first three observing runs of LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA, we combine catalogs of directly detected binaries and limits on the stochastic background to constrain the time-delay distribution and metallicity dependence of binary black hole evolution. Looking to the future, we also explore how these constraints will be improved at the Advanced LIGO A+ sensitivity. We conclude that, although binary black hole formation cannot be strongly constrained with today’s data, the future detection (or a nondetection) of the gravitational-wave background with Advanced LIGO A+ will carry strong implications for the evolution of binary black holes.

Large-scale cosmic filaments may have played an important role in shaping the properties of galaxies. Meanwhile, cosmic filaments are believed to harbor a substantial portion of the missing baryons at redshift z < 2. To inspect the role of filaments in these issues, many properties of filaments need to be examined, including their lengths, thicknesses, and density profiles. However, measuring some of these properties poses challenges. This study concentrates on estimating filament width/thickness, investigating potential correlations between the local width of filaments and the properties of dark matter halos within filaments. We find that the local width of filaments generally increases with the mass of dark matter halos embedded in filaments per unit length, roughly following a second-order polynomial, although with notable scatter. We probe and discuss means that may refine our findings. After further verification and improvements, this relation could be applied to filament samples constructed from the observed galaxy distribution, aiding in understanding the roles of cosmic filaments in galaxy evolution and uncovering the missing baryons.

The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) provides an avenue to study black hole accretion flows on event-horizon scales. Fitting a semianalytical model to EHT observations requires the construction of synthetic images, which is computationally expensive. This study presents an image generation tool in the form of a generative machine-learning model, which extends the capabilities of a variational autoencoder. This tool can rapidly and continuously interpolate between a training set of images and can retrieve the defining parameters of those images. Trained on a set of synthetic black hole images, our tool showcases success in interpolating both black hole images and their associated physical parameters. By reducing the computational cost of generating an image, this tool facilitates parameter estimation and model validation for observations of black hole systems.

<div> 模拟，大气分馏，行星大气，逃逸，恒星类型

在这篇文章中，研究者使用了一个新的开源数值模型IsoFATE来模拟逃逸行星大气中的大气分馏。他们扩展了之前研究的参数空间，对具有稀薄大气层的行星进行了研究，这些行星在氦和氘增强方面表现出最显著的特征。研究模拟了极紫外驱动的光蒸发和核驱动的质量损失对G、K和M型恒星周围的次海王星大气层的氘-氢和氦-氢分馏的影响。他们的模拟预测，在半人马星区域的上部边缘，将出现明显的氘和氦增强行星族群，平均平衡温度约为370K，在各种恒星类型周围甚至可以低至150K。研究发现，分馏是机制相关的，因此约束次海王星大气层中的氦/氢和氘/氢丰度提供了一种探究低质量恒星周围半径谷起源的独特策略。此外，分馏还强烈依赖于保留的大气质量，提供了一个行星表面压力的代理，以及区分干涸的包气类地球和水世界的方式。氘增强行星往往以氦为主，并且缺乏CH4，这为在3.7μm窗口观察HDO提供了一种有前途的策略。研究者提出了观测后续的有前景的目标清单。

We simulate atmospheric fractionation in escaping planetary atmospheres using IsoFATE, a new open-source numerical model. We expand the parameter space studied previously to planets with tenuous atmospheres that exhibit the greatest helium and deuterium enhancement. We simulate the effects of extreme-ultraviolet-driven photoevaporation and core-powered mass loss on deuterium–hydrogen and helium–hydrogen fractionation of sub-Neptune atmospheres around G, K, and M stars. Our simulations predict prominent populations of deuterium- and helium-enhanced planets along the upper edge of the radius valley with mean equilibrium temperatures of ≈370 K and as low as 150 K across stellar types. We find that fractionation is mechanism dependent, so constraining He/H and D/H abundances in sub-Neptune atmospheres offers a unique strategy to investigate the origin of the radius valley around low-mass stars. Fractionation is also strongly dependent on retained atmospheric mass, offering a proxy for planetary surface pressure as well as a way to distinguish between desiccated enveloped terrestrials and water worlds. Deuterium-enhanced planets tend to be helium dominated and CH4 depleted, providing a promising strategy to observe HDO in the 3.7 μm window. We present a list of promising targets for observational follow-up.

We present the discovery of 13 new widely separated T dwarf companions to M dwarf primaries, identified using Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer/NEOWISE data by the CatWISE and Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 projects (hereafter BYW). This sample represents an ∼60% increase in the number of known M + T systems, and allows us to probe the most extreme products of binary/planetary system formation, a discovery space made available by the CatWISE2020 catalog and the BYW effort. Highlights among the sample are WISEP J075108.79-763449.6, a previously known T9 thought to be old due to its spectral energy distribution, which was found by Zhang et al. (2021b) to be part of a common proper motion pair with L34-26 A, a well-studied young M3 V star within 10 pc of the Sun; CWISE J054129.32-745021.5 B and 2MASS J05581644-4501559 B, two T8 dwarfs possibly associated with the very fast-rotating M4 V stars CWISE J054129.32745021.5 A and 2MASS J05581644-4501559 A; and UCAC3 52-1038 B, which is among the widest late-T companions to main-sequence stars, with a projected separation of ∼7100 au. The new benchmarks presented here are prime JWST targets, and can help us place strong constraints on the formation and evolution theory of substellar objects as well as on atmospheric models for these cold exoplanet analogs.

这篇文章报告了对HESS J1641−463的NuSTAR数据分析结果。研究结果表明，在2-10 keV范围内存在X射线上限约为6 × 10^−13 erg cm^−2 s^−1 （在10-20 keV范围内约为3 × 10^−13 erg cm^−2 s^−1）。文章指出，如果伽玛射线的发射源是CR质子与周围物质相互作用产生的π0介子衰变，则在质子-质子相互作用中产生的次级电子可能会在X射线波段发出同步辐射光子。然而，本研究得到的X射线上限并不能对主要质子谱施加约束，需要未来硬X射线任务的进一步观测。 <br /><br />总结: HESS J1641−463是一个TeV能量谱的伽玛射线源，NuSTAR数据分析显示在X射线波段没有明显的对应源，并得到了X射线上限值。文章指出了这一结果对主要质子谱提供的约束不足，但也提出了未来研究的方向。 <div>
HESS J1641−463 is an unidentified gamma-ray source with a hard TeV gamma-ray spectrum, and thus it has been proposed to be a possible candidate for a cosmic-ray (CR) accelerator up to PeV energies (a PeVatron candidate). The source spatially coincides with the radio supernova remnant G338.5+0.1 but has not yet been fully explored in the X-ray band. We analyzed newly taken NuSTAR data, pointing at HESS J1641−463, with 82 ks effective exposure time. There is no apparent X-ray counterpart of HESS J1641−463, while nearby stellar cluster, Mercer 81, and stray-light X-rays are detected. Combined with the archival Chandra data, partially covering the source, we derived an upper limit of ∼6 × 10−13 erg cm−2 s−1 in 2–10 keV (∼3 × 10−13 erg cm−2 s−1 in 10–20 keV). If the gamma-ray emission is originated from the decay of π0 mesons produced in interactions between CR protons and ambient materials, secondary electrons in the proton–proton interactions can potentially emit synchrotron photons in the X-ray band, which can be tested by our X-ray observations. Although the obtained X-ray upper limits cannot place a constraint on the primary proton spectrum, it will be possible with a future hard X-ray mission.

The radio galaxy PKS 1007+142 is classified as a compact steep-spectrum source (CSS) and belongs to the class of young active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In this paper, we investigate the γ-ray emission from this CSS by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the 15 yr Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) observation data. The Fermi-LAT latest Source Catalog, 4FGL-DR4, includes an unassociated γ-ray source, 4FGL J1010.0+1416, located at 0.°24 away from the radio position of PKS 1007+142. Using the 15 yr Fermi-LAT observation data, we reestimate the best-fit position of the γ-ray source and find that PKS 1007+142 is in close proximity to the γ-ray source and falls within its 68% error circle. Therefore, we conclude that PKS 1007+142 is the most plausible counterpart to the unassociated LAT source with detection test statistics ∼ 43.4 (∼6.6σ). PKS 1007+142 exhibits a steep power-law spectrum in the 0.1–300 GeV band, with a photon spectral index (Γγ) of 2.86 ± 0.17. The average flux in the considered time interval is (2.14 ± 0.34) × 10−12 erg cm−2 s−1. Comparing PKS 1007+142 with other γ-ray emitting AGNs in both the Lγ–Γγ and Lγ–L1.4 GHz planes, it shows a softer γ-ray spectrum and lower luminosity compared to other γ-ray emitting CSSs. Furthermore, the possible origins of γ-ray in PKS 1007+142 are also discussed.

Most brown dwarfs show some level of photometric or spectral variability. However, finding the most variable dwarfs more suited for a thorough variability monitoring campaign remained a challenge until a few years ago with the design of spectral indices to find the most likely L and T dwarfs using their near-infrared (NIR) single-epoch spectrum. In this work, we designed and tested NIR spectral indices to preselect the most likely variable L4–L8 dwarfs, complementing the indices presented by Ashraf et al. and Oliveros-Gomez et al. We used time-resolved NIR Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 spectra of an L6.0 dwarf, LP 261–75b, to design our novel spectral indices. We tested these spectral indices on 75 L4.0–L8.0 NIR SpeX/IRTF spectra, providing 27 new variable candidates. Our indices have a recovery rate of ∼80% and a false negative rate of ∼25%. All the known nonvariable brown dwarfs were found to be nonvariable by our indices. We estimated the variability fraction of our sample to be %, which agrees with the variability fractions provided by Buenzli et al., Radigan et al., and Metchev et al. for L4–L8 dwarfs. These spectral indices may support the future selection of the most likely variable directly imaged exoplanets for studies with the James Webb Space Telescope and as well as the 30 m telescopes.

The physical processes responsible for shaping how galaxies form and quench over time leave imprints on both the spatial (galaxy morphology) and temporal (star formation history; SFH) tracers that we use to study galaxies. While the morphology–SFR connection is well studied, the correlation with past star formation activity is not as well understood. To quantify this, we present Katachi (形), an interpretable convolutional neural network framework that learns the connection between the factors regulating star formation in galaxies on different spatial and temporal scales. Katachi is trained on 9904 galaxies at 0.02 < z < 0.1 in the SDSS-IV MaNGA DR17 sample to predict stellar mass (M*; root mean square error (RSME) 0.22 dex), current star formation rate (SFR; RMSE 0.31 dex), and half-mass time (t50; RMSE 0.23 dex). This information allows us to reconstruct nonparametric SFHs for each galaxy from gri imaging alone. To quantify the morphological features informing the SFH predictions, we use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). We recover the expected trends of M* governed by the growth of galaxy bulges, as well as those of SFR correlating with spiral arms and other star-forming regions. We also find that the SHAP maps of D4000 are more complex than those of M* and SFR, and that morphology is correlated with t50 even at fixed mass and SFR. Katachi serves as a scalable public framework to predict galaxy properties from large imaging surveys including Rubin, Roman, and Euclid, with large data sets of high signal-to-noise ratio imaging across limited photometric bands.

<div> Thorne–Żytkow–like objects, collapsar models, gamma-ray burst, Neutron star, White dwarf
<br />
TZlO由中子星和致密白矮星组成，可以解释GRB的特征。GRB 211211A可能是由引擎驱动的巨新星，而GRB 200826A的超新星颠簸可能是由喷射物与盘风壳的碰撞引起的。这项研究挑战了传统的collapsar模型，提出了新的理论解释，并与观测结果相一致。总结：<br /> 这项研究提出了Thorne–Żytkow–like objects (TZlO) 的模型来解释两种类型的伽马射线暴事件，给出了关于GRB 211211A和GRB 200826A的观测解释，并对传统的collapsar模型进行了挑战。 <div>
The Type II gamma-ray burst (GRB) 200826A challenges collapsar models by questioning how they can generate a genuinely short-duration event. The other Type I GRB 211211A confused us with a kilonova signature observed in the afterglow of a long burst. Here, we propose a comprehensive model in which both bursts are the results of the collapse of Thorne–Żytkow–like objects (TZlOs). The TZlO consists of a central neutron star (NS), with a dense white dwarf (WD) material envelope, which is formed as the aftermath of a WD-NS coalescence. We find that the characteristics of the resultant GRBs depend on whether the TZlO collapses immediately following the WD-NS merger or not. Additionally, the observational properties of the consequent GRBs manifest variations contingent upon whether the collapse of the TZlO results in a magnetar or a black hole. We also show that our model is consistent with the observations of GRB 211211A and GRB 200826A. Specifically, the optical excess in GRB 211211A can be attributed to an engine-fed kilonova, while the supernova bump in GRB 200826A is likely due to the collision between the ejecta and the disk wind shell.

<div> 关键词: 天文学, 机器学习, 无标签数据, 半监督学习, 脉冲星

总结:<br />
本研究提出并验证了一种自我调节伪标签半监督学习方法，有效提高了分类器性能，实现了从传统的全监督学习方法向更高效的射电脉冲星检测策略的过渡。实验结果表明，即使训练集仅包含100个已标记的脉冲星候选对象，该方法的召回率可达92.35%，F1得分为93.89%。当标记示例数量增加到800时，性能进一步提高，召回率达到97.50%，F1得分达到97.16%。半监督学习方法即使在标记数据量有限的情况下也能有效发现脉冲星候选对象。这突显了我们方法在促进早期脉冲星调查方面的潜力，并强调了其在标记数据短缺情况下产生实质性结果的能力。 <div>
In the field of astronomy, machine-learning technologies are becoming increasingly crucial for identifying radio pulsars. However, the process of acquiring labeled data, which is both time-consuming and potentially biased, poses a significant limitation to current methodologies. In response to these challenges, this study proposes and validates a self-tuning pseudolabeling semisupervised learning approach. This approach synthesizes a vast unlabeled data set with a considerably smaller set of labeled data, markedly enhancing classifier performance and effectuating a transition from traditional fully supervised learning methods to more efficient radio pulsar detection strategies. Our experimental outcomes demonstrate that even with a training set comprised of only 100 labeled pulsar candidates, this method can attain a recall rate of 92.35% and an F1 score of 93.89%. When the number of labeled examples is increased to 800, we observe a further improvement in performance, with the recall rate rising to 97.50% and the F1 score reaching 97.16%. The utility of the semisupervised learning approach is evident even with minimal labeled data, which is a common scenario in the search for pulsars, including in environments like globular clusters. What stands out is the method’s capacity to detect pulsar candidates effectively with only a limited number of labeled examples. This emphasizes the robust potential of our approach to facilitate early-stage pulsar surveys and highlights its capability to yield substantial results even when labeled data are in short supply.

<div> UHECRs, photons, CMB, SU(2)CMB, cosmogenic neutrinos
<br />总结:
作者重新审视了超高能宇宙射线（UHECRs）与宇宙微波背景（CMB）光子的相互作用，探讨了改变的温度-红移关系T(z)。该改变的温度-红移关系是根据将热化和各向同性的光子气体（如CMB）置于SU(2)而不是U(1)规范群的假设提出的。这种ΛCDM的修改被称为SU(2)CMB，其中一些宇宙学参数似乎与相同量的局部测量结果更加吻合，特别是H0和S8。在本研究中，我们将SU(2)CMB下的减少的CMB光子密度应用于UHECRs的传播。这导致在宇宙射线谱线ankle以下的地方有更高的UHECR通量，在其他条件相等的情况下，宇宙成因中微子也会略微增多。最突出的是，在硬注入谱线和不考虑磁场效应的情况下，脉冲通量在ankle以下（5×1018 eV）显著增加了。CMB光子密度的减少也有利于较佳适合ΛCDM的宇宙射线源演化的减少。因此，似乎SU(2)CMB更有利于像恒星形成率这样的源的演化，例如恒星爆发星系和伽马射线暴，而不是活跃星系核作为UHECRs的起源。我们得出结论，CMB的温度-红移关系的假设直接影响了UHECRs的主要来源的性质。 <div>
We reexamine the interactions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) with photons from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) under a changed, locally nonlinear temperature–redshift relation T(z). This changed temperature–redshift relation has recently been suggested by the postulate of subjecting thermalized and isotropic photon gases such as the CMB to an SU(2) rather than a U(1) gauge group. This modification of ΛCDM is called SU(2)CMB, and some cosmological parameters obtained by SU(2)CMB seem to be in better agreement with local measurements of the same quantities, in particular H0 and S8. In this work, we apply the reduced CMB photon density under SU(2)CMB to the propagation of UHECRs. This leads to a higher UHECR flux just below the ankle in the cosmic ray spectrum and slightly more cosmogenic neutrinos under otherwise equal conditions for emission and propagation. Most prominently, the proton flux is significantly increased below the ankle (5 × 1018 eV) for hard injection spectra and without considering the effects of magnetic fields. The reduction in CMB photon density also favors a decreased cosmic ray source evolution than the best fit using ΛCDM. In consequence, it seems that SU(2)CMB favors sources that evolve like the star formation rate, such as starburst galaxies and gamma-ray bursts, over active galactic nuclei as origins of UHECRs. We conclude that the question about the nature of primary sources of UHECRs is directly affected by the assumed temperature–redshift relation of the CMB.

<title>Two Repeated Transient Quasiperiodic Oscillations in the γ-Ray Emission from the Blazar 3C 279</title>

<div> 重要关键词: 3C 279, QPO, γ-ray light curve, 二元黑洞, 双喷流

这项研究首次报道了TeV类星体3C 279的γ射线光变曲线中出现的两次重复的瞬变准周期振荡（QPO）。研究使用加权小波Z变换、Lomb–Scargle周期图和REDFIT技术在光变曲线中搜索周期性，并评估其置信水平。主要结果如下：（1）在2009年6月至11月的117天内的耀斑期间（MJD 55008–55125），发现了一个约33天的QPO（＞2.5σ），有趣的是，相同的QPO（约39天）在MJD 59430至59585的持续耀斑期间重新出现，置信水平＞4σ；（2）在2019年2月至2020年5月的455天内的一段时间（MJD 58430–58985），发现了另一个约91天的瞬变QPO，显著性＞3.8σ。考虑到文献中报道的QPO，约40天的QPO出现了三次，约91天的QPO出现了两次。我们讨论了一些可以解释这个类星体QPO的物理模型。研究可能表明，这两种QPO源自3C 279中心的双黑洞的双喷流。相似尺度的QPO的重复出现强烈支持一个在喷流内部螺旋运动的斑块的几何情景。此外，喷流中的外层也可能是解释光变曲线中观察到的重复γ射线耀斑模式的潜在解释。 <br /><br />总结: 首次报道了TeV类星体3C 279的γ射线光变曲线中出现的两次重复的瞬变准周期振荡（QPO）。这些QPO出现在不同时间段内，且重复出现，可能与双喷流的二元黑洞有关。对于这类光变现象的物理模型有了新的解释和理解。 <div>
In this work, we report for the first time two repeated transient quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) in the γ-ray light curve of the TeV blazar 3C 279. We search for the periodicity in the light curve and estimate its confidence level using the weighted wavelet Z-transform, the Lomb–Scargle periodogram, and the REDFIT techniques. The main results are as follows: (1) a QPO of ∼33 days (>2.5σ) is found during the flare of 117 days (MJD 55008–55125) from 2009 June to November. Interestingly, the same QPO (∼39 days) reappeared in the flaring duration from MJD 59430 to 59585, with the confidence level of >4σ. (2) Another transient QPO of ∼91 days with a significance of >3.8σ is found during a period with 455 days (MJD 58430–58985) from 2019 February to 2020 May. Under the premise of considering the QPOs reported in the literature, the QPO of ∼40 days is repeated three times and the QPO of ∼91 days is repeated twice. We discuss several physical models explaining the QPOs of this blazar. Our study may suggest that the two QPOs originate from the twin jets of the binary black holes at the center of 3C 279. The repeated occurrence of QPOs of a similar scale strongly supports the geometric scenario of a blob spiraling within the jet. Furthermore, the hypothesis of a sheath in the jet may also be a potential explanation for the repetitive γ-ray flare patterns observed in the light curve.

<div> neutrinos, collective oscillations, nucleosynthesis, astrophysical conditions, νp-process
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了紧凑天体物理过程中中微子的集体振荡现象及其在超新星环境中核合成产物的影响。研究发现，在高熵、富质子条件下，中微子相互作用会导致新的中子俘获过程的发生，被称为“νi-过程”，这将产生独特的质子富集低质量核素和中子富集高质量核素。此外，中微子之间的量子相关性也会影响产物的分布，与平均场振荡处理方式产生不同的结果。 <div>
In high-energy astrophysical processes involving compact objects, such as core-collapse supernovae or binary neutron star mergers, neutrinos play an important role in the synthesis of nuclides. Neutrinos in these environments can experience collective flavor oscillations driven by neutrino–neutrino interactions, including coherent forward scattering and incoherent (collisional) effects. Recently, there has been interest in exploring potential novel behaviors in collective oscillations of neutrinos by going beyond the one-particle effective or “mean-field” treatments. Here, we seek to explore implications of collective neutrino oscillations, in the mean-field treatment and beyond, for the nucleosynthesis yields in supernova environments with different astrophysical conditions and neutrino inputs. We find that collective oscillations can impact the operation of the νp-process and r-process nucleosynthesis in supernovae. The potential impact is particularly strong in high-entropy, proton-rich conditions, where we find that neutrino interactions can nudge an initial νp-process neutron-rich, resulting in a unique combination of proton-rich low-mass nuclei as well as neutron-rich high-mass nuclei. We describe this neutrino-induced neutron-capture process as the “νi-process.” In addition, nontrivial quantum correlations among neutrinos, if present significantly, could lead to different nuclide yields compared to the corresponding mean-field oscillation treatments, by virtue of modifying the evolution of the relevant one-body neutrino observables.

总结:
在这篇文章中，研究人员通过对大质量恒星形成过程中的模拟计算，发现了在喷流腔和落入的包层之间的冲击区域，存在高达10^7K的冲击加热和几乎完全电离的现象。与观测到的大质量原恒星G35.20-0.74N的数值一致。通过计算射电连续光度和光谱，将模型与观测样本进行比较发现，模型产生的射电亮度与低中质量原恒星的相似，但比较大质量原恒星的射电亮度要小10-100倍。最后，研究还观察到模型在内部1000天文单位范围内出现了约5%的10年射电流量变化，这与一些超紧致H ii区域的观测水平相当。<br /><br /> <div>
Massive protostars launch accretion-powered, magnetically collimated outflows, which play crucial roles in the dynamics and diagnostics of the star formation process. Here we calculate the shock heating and resulting free–free radio emission in numerical models of outflows of massive star formation within the framework of the Turbulent Core Accretion model. We postprocess 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulation snapshots of a protostellar disk wind interacting with an infalling core envelope, and calculate shock temperatures, ionization fractions, and radio free–free emission. We find heating up to ∼107 K and near-complete ionization in shocks at the interface between the outflow cavity and infalling envelope. However, line-of-sight averaged ionization fractions peak around ∼10%, in agreement with values reported from observations of massive protostar G35.20-0.74N. By calculating radio-continuum fluxes and spectra, we compare our models with observed samples of massive protostars. We find our fiducial models produce radio luminosities similar to those seen from low- and intermediate-mass protostars that are thought to be powered by shock ionization. Comparing to more massive protostars, we find our model radio luminosities are ∼10–100 times less luminous. We discuss how this apparent discrepancy either reflects aspects of our modeling related to the treatment of cooling of the post-shock gas or a dominant contribution in the observed systems from photoionization. Finally, our models exhibit 10 yr radio flux variability of ∼5%, especially in the inner 1000 au region, comparable to observed levels in some hypercompact H ii regions.

科学家在仙女座星系（M31）中使用Robert C. Byrd Green Bank望远镜进行了18厘米羟基（OH）线的极其敏感的探测。他们成功地测量到了微弱的发射信号，并且发现了与局部热力学平衡条件下预期的特征性比率。这是在其他星系中首次探测到非激射器状态下的18厘米OH发射。通过将他们的OH和H i观测结果与CO（1-0）观测结果进行比较，他们发现OH追踪到的H2气体比CO追踪到的数量多100%-140%。此外，尘埃数据暗示了更多的暗分子气体存在。因此，作者得出结论，18厘米OH线可能是在近邻星系中绘制“CO-暗”和“CO-微弱”分子气体相的有价值工具，尤其是在未来的多波束、相控阵饲养接收器上。这将大大提高对微弱信号的绘图速度。 <br /><br />总结:科学家在M31中成功探测到了18厘米OH线发射，并发现其追踪到的H2气体比CO更多。这表明18厘米OH线对于绘制星系中的“CO-暗”和“CO-微弱”分子气体相是有价值的工具。 <div>
The most abundant interstellar molecule, molecular hydrogen (H2), is practically invisible in cold molecular clouds. Astronomers typically use carbon monoxide (CO) to trace the bulk distribution and mass of H2 in our galaxy and many others. CO observations alone fail to trace a significant component of molecular gas known as “CO-dark” molecular gas, which can be probed with molecules such as OH and CH. We present an extremely sensitive pilot search for the 18 cm hydroxyl (OH) lines in the Andromeda galaxy (M31) with the 100 m Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope. We successfully detected the 1665 and 1667 MHz OH lines in faint emission. The 1665/1667 MHz line ratio displays the characteristic 5:9 ratio predicted under conditions of local thermodynamic equilibrium. To our knowledge, this is the first detection of nonmaser 18 cm OH emission in another galaxy. We compare our OH and H i observations with archival CO (1–0) observations. Our OH detection position overlaps with the previously discovered Arp Outer Arm in CO. Our best estimates show that the amount of H2 traced by OH is 100%–140% higher than the amount traced by CO in this sight line. The amount of dark molecular gas implied by dust data supports this conclusion. We conclude that the 18 cm OH lines hold promise as a valuable tool for mapping of the “CO-dark” and “CO-faint” molecular gas phase in nearby galaxies, especially with upcoming multibeam, phased-array feed receivers on radio telescopes, which will allow for drastically improved mapping speeds of faint signals.

总结:<br /><br />这篇研究比较了日冕结构sigmoid的手征性和其中的丝状物的旋性，发现它们并非总是具有相同的螺旋性。另外，通过对具有sigmoid的区域下方的光球矢量磁图进行非线性自由力近似，得出了力自由参数的加权平均值，并将其与丝状物的旋性和观察到的日冕sigmoid的手性进行了相关性分析。研究表明，那些具有不同螺旋性标志的区域产生喷发事件的概率约为同螺旋性区域的3.5倍。此外，还对NOAA AR 12473的磁能量/螺旋性演变进行了案例研究。 <div>
Sigmoids produce strong eruptive events. Earlier studies have shown that the ICME axial magnetic field Bz can be predicted with some credibility by observing the corresponding filament or the polarity inversion line in the region of eruption and deriving the magnetic field direction from that. Sigmoids are coronal structures often associated with filaments in the sigmoidal region. In this study, we compare filament chirality with sigmoid handedness to observe their correlation. Second, we perform nonlinear force-free approximations of the coronal magnetic connectivity using photospheric vector magnetograms underneath sigmoids to obtain a weighted-average value of the force-free parameter and to correlate it with filament chirality and the observed coronal sigmoid handedness. Importantly, we find that the sigmoids and their filament counterparts do not always have the same helicity signs. Production of eruptive events by regions that do not have the same signs of helicities is ∼3.5 times higher than when they do. A case study of magnetic energy/ helicity evolution in NOAA AR 12473 is also presented.

We introduce a new Python 1D chemical kinetic code, Full and Reduced Exoplanet Chemical Kinetics distiLLed (FRECKLL), to evolve large chemical networks efficiently. FRECKLL employs “distillation” in computing the reaction rates, which minimizes the error bounds to the minimum allowed by double precision values (ϵ ≤ 10−15). Compared to summation of rates with traditional algorithms like pairwise summation, distillation provides a tenfold reduction in solver time for both full and reduced networks. Both the full and reduced Venot2020 networks are packaged in FRECKLL as well as a TauREx 3.1 plug-in for usage in forward modeling and retrievals of exoplanet atmospheres. We present TauREx retrievals performed on a simulated HD 189733b JWST spectra using the full and reduced Venot2020 chemical networks and demonstrate the viability of total disequilibrium chemistry retrievals and the ability for JWST to detect disequilibrium processes.

总结: 本研究利用ALMA、HST和JWST进行了对NGC 3351中心星暴环内的幼年大质量星团的研究。利用ALMA数据发现了18个明亮而紧凑的（亚）毫米连续源，其中8个在JWST图像中有对应物，只有6个在HST图像中有对应物。根据ALMA连续体和分子线数据，以及HST和JWST对应物的辅助测量，确定了14个具有高恒星和/或气体质量（~105M⊙）、小半径（≲ 5 pc）、大逃逸速度（6-10 km s−1）和短自由落体时间（0.5-1 Myr）的幼年星团。它们的多波段性质表明它们可分为四类，可能对应着从无星凝块到裸露的H ii区-星团复合体四个演化阶段。利用同一区域HST识别的星团的年龄估计，推断了一个演化时间线，从星团形成前约1-2百万年作为无星凝块，到形成后约4-6百万年呈裸露的H ii区-星团复合体。最后，我们发现幼年大质量星团构成了环的大部分新星形成，展现出非均匀的方位分布，没有非常连续的演化趋势，并且能够驱动大规模的气体流出。 <br /><br /> <div>
We use 0.1″ observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and JWST to study young massive clusters (YMCs) in their embedded “infant” phase across the central starburst ring in NGC 3351. Our new ALMA data reveal 18 bright and compact (sub-)millimeter continuum sources, of which 8 have counterparts in JWST images and only 6 have counterparts in HST images. Based on the ALMA continuum and molecular line data, as well as ancillary measurements for the HST and JWST counterparts, we identify 14 sources as infant star clusters with high stellar and/or gas masses (∼105M⊙), small radii (≲ 5 pc), large escape velocities (6–10 km s−1), and short freefall times (0.5–1 Myr). Their multiwavelength properties motivate us to divide them into four categories, likely corresponding to four evolutionary stages from starless clumps to exposed H ii region–cluster complexes. Leveraging age estimates for HST-identified clusters in the same region, we infer an evolutionary timeline, ranging from ∼1–2 Myr before cluster formation as starless clumps, to ∼4–6 Myr after as exposed H ii region–cluster complexes. Finally, we show that the YMCs make up a substantial fraction of recent star formation across the ring, exhibit a nonuniform azimuthal distribution without a very coherent evolutionary trend along the ring, and are capable of driving large-scale gas outflows.

<div> SGR J1935+2154, X-ray burst, fast radio burst, 分布, 磁场拓扑
SGR J1550-5418是一颗类似SGR J1935+2154的活跃磁星。研究发现，SGR J1550-5418的最小变化时间尺度(MVT)遵循对数正态分布函数，平均值为6.4 ± 0.4毫秒。值得注意的是，MVT的平均值在2008年10月大约比2009年的平均值大3倍，这表明辐射区域可能存在变化，这可能归因于磁场拓扑的变化。此外，并未发现MVT与持续时间或能量之间存在显著相关性，也没有发现在不同能量范围内SGR J1550-5418和SGR J1935+2154的MVT分布存在显著差异，支持它们有着共同的物理起源。<br /><br />总结: 本研究对两颗活跃磁星SGR J1550-5418和SGR J1935+2154的X-ray burst进行了详细分析，发现它们的MVT遵循对数正态分布函数，且存在时间尺度的演化，但与持续时间和能量没有显著相关性，这一发现支持它们有着共同的物理起源。 <div>
The major observation of the X-ray burst (XRB) in association with the fast radio burst (FRB) FRB 200428 originating from SGR J1935+2154 on 2020 April 28 substantiates magnetars as one of the origins of FRBs. However, it is still unclear why only a few XRBs in association with FRBs have been observed solely in this magnetar. In this study, we investigate the minimum variation timescales (MVTs) of XRBs from SGR J1550-5418, an active magnetar similar to SGR J1935+2154, and conduct a comprehensive comparison of their MVT properties. Our analysis reveals that the distribution of the MVT for SGR J1550-5418 follows a lognormal Gaussian function with the mean 6.4 ± 0.4 ms. Interestingly, we detect an evolution in the MVTs, i.e., the fitted mean of the MVT distribution in 2008 October is about 3 times larger than that in 2009, indicating potential variations in radiation regions possibly attributed to changes in magnetic field topology. Besides, we do not find a significant correlation between the MVT and either duration or energy. Finally, there is no significant difference between the MVT distributions across different energy ranges for SGR J1550-5418 and SGR J1935+2154, which supports a common physical origin.

<div> 关键词: 高Lundquist数等离子体，揭示性重连接，磁流体力学，电离等离子体，撕裂性重连接

总结:<br /><br />本文研究了在电离较差的等离子体系统中撕裂介导的重连接的起始和线性演变过程。在较差电离的等离子体中，磁场的零点会通过环境扩散逐渐变得更加尖锐，从而抑制了重连接的开始。一旦电液层变得足够薄，离子将脱离中性粒子，电液层的变薄速度减慢，重连接即可开始。研究还发现，可以通过电离较差的撕裂色散关系来预测首次扰乱形成电流层的波长和增长率。随着等离子体复合速率的增加和离子化分数的减少，增长率将成为离子-中性碰撞频率的增倍数，而波长将成为Alfvén速度和离子-中性碰撞频率之比的减少倍数。 <div>
In high-Lundquist-number plasmas, reconnection proceeds via the onset of tearing, followed by a nonlinear phase during which plasmoids continuously form, merge, and are ejected from the current sheet (CS). This process is understood in fully ionized, magnetohydrodynamic plasmas. However, many plasma environments, such as star-forming molecular clouds and the solar chromosphere, are poorly ionized. We use theory and computation to study tearing-mediated reconnection in such poorly ionized systems. In this paper, we focus on the onset and linear evolution of this process. In poorly ionized plasmas, magnetic nulls on scales below vA,n0/νni0, with vA,n0 the neutral Alfvén speed and νni0 the neutral–ion collision frequency, will self-sharpen via ambipolar diffusion. This sharpening occurs at an increasing rate, inhibiting the onset of reconnection. Once the CS becomes thin enough, however, ions decouple from neutrals and the thinning of the CS slows, allowing the onset of tearing in a time of order . We find that the wavelength and growth rate of the mode that first disrupts the forming sheet can be predicted from a poorly ionized tearing dispersion relation; as the plasma recombination rate increases and ionization fraction decreases, the growth rate becomes an increasing multiple of νni0 and the wavelength becomes a decreasing fraction of vA,n0/νni0.

<div> 关键词: 涡旋星系，可见质量，暗物质，MaNGA数据，速度测量 <br />
总结:  
本研究通过观测超过5500个涡旋星系的Hα发射线速度，比较了其在90%椭圆Petrosian半径R90处的旋转速度与其可见质量所预期速度的比值。我们计算了来自恒星、氢气、H2、重金属和尘埃质量的总可见质量，并将H2质量建立成r带绝对星等的函数。基于统计分析，我们得出结论，在涡旋星系的可见范围内，不能以95%的置信水平排除无暗物质的零假设。此外，我们发现，在考虑所有质量组分时，星系的可见质量与总质量之比随其亮度增加而增加。 <br /> <div>
We present a study of the ratio of visible mass to total mass in spiral galaxies to better understand the relative amount of dark matter present in galaxies of different masses and evolutionary stages. Using the velocities of the Hα emission line measured in spectroscopic observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) MaNGA Data Release 17 (DR 17), we evaluate the rotational velocity of over 5500 disk galaxies at their 90% elliptical Petrosian radii, R90. We compare this to the velocity expected from the total visible mass, which we compute from the stellar, H i, H2, and heavy metals and dust masses. H2 mass measurements are available for only a small subset of galaxies observed in SDSS MaNGA DR17, so we derive a parameterization of the H2 mass as a function of absolute magnitude in the r band using galaxies observed as part of SDSS DR7. With these parameterizations, we calculate the fraction of visible mass within R90 that corresponds to the observed velocity. Based on statistically analyzing the likelihood of this fraction, we conclude that the null hypothesis (no dark matter) cannot be excluded at a confidence level better than 95% within the visible extent of the disk galaxies. We also find that when all mass components are included, the ratio of visible to total mass within the visible extent of star-forming disk galaxies increases with galaxy luminosity.

<div> Protoplanetary disks, HD line flux, dust SED, statistical relationships, Monte Carlo<br /> 
总结: 该研究使用3000个ProDiMo盘模型讨论了原行星盘的质量、氢化二铟(HD)线流和尘埃谱能量分布(SED)之间的统计关系。他们发现质量加权的HD分数丰度几乎是恒定的，尽管紫外线通量变化了几个数量级。通过对物理量和HD流量之间的统计关系的探讨，他们发现低质量(光学薄)盘显示了平均盘气温与HD线流之间的紧密关联，而大质量盘则没有这种关联。研究还证明，中央恒星的光度、盘尺寸、尘埃尺寸分布和HD流量可以用来确定盘气体质量，精度在3倍以内。他们还发现，远红外和亚毫米/毫米波SED以及HD流量可以作为确定盘气体质量的强约束，精度在2倍以内。如果HD线完全光谱分辨(R≳1.5×10^6, Δv=0.2 km s^-1)，那么单独的56和112微米HD线剖面可以将盘气体质量确定在2倍以内。 <div>
We discuss statistical relationships between the mass of protoplanetary disks, the hydrogen deuteride (HD) line flux, and the dust spectral energy distribution (SED) determined using 3000 ProDiMo disk models. The models have 15 free parameters describing the disk physical properties, the central star, and the local radiation field. The sampling of physical parameters is done using a Monte Carlo approach to evaluate the probability density functions of observables as a function of physical parameters. We find that the mass-averaged HD fractional abundance is almost constant even though the ultraviolet flux varies by several orders of magnitude. Probing the statistical relation between the physical quantities and the HD flux, we find that low-mass (optically thin) disks display a tight correlation between the average disk gas temperature and HD line flux, while massive disks show no such correlation. We demonstrate that the central star luminosity, disk size, dust size distribution, and HD flux may be used to determine the disk gas mass within a factor of 3. We also find that the far-infrared and submillimeter/millimeter SEDs and the HD flux may serve as strong constraints for determining the disk gas mass to within a factor of 2. If the HD lines are fully spectrally resolved (R ≳ 1.5 × 106, Δv = 0.2 km s−1), the 56 and 112 μm HD line profiles alone may constrain the disk gas mass to within a factor of 2.

Solar magnetic flux rope (MFR) plays a central role in the physics of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). It mainly includes a cold filament at typical chromospheric temperatures (∼10,000 K) and a hot channel at high coronal temperatures (∼10 MK). The warm MFR at quiescent coronal temperatures of a million Kelvin is, however, rarely reported. In this study, using multiwavelength images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory and Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI) on board the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory-A, we present an eruption of a warm channel that represents an MFR with quiescent coronal temperatures (∼0.6–2.5 MK). On 2022 May 8, we observed the failed eruption of a hot channel, with the average temperature and emission measure (EM) of 10 MK and 1.1 × 1028 cm−5, using AIA high-temperature images in the active region (AR) 13007. This failed eruption was associated with a C8.2 flare, with no CME. Subsequently, we observed a warm channel that appeared in AIA and EUVI low-temperature images rather than in AIA high-temperature images. It then erupted and transformed into a semicircular shape. An associated C2.1 flare, along with the signatures of magnetic reconnection in AIA high-temperature images, were identified. Additionally, we observed a CME associated with this event. Compared with the hot channel, the warm channel is cooler and rarer with the average temperature and EM of 1.7 (1.6) MK and 2.0 × 1026 (2.3 × 1026) cm−5. All the results suggest an unambiguous observation of the million-Kelvin warm MFR that erupted as a CME and fill a gap in the temperature domain of coronal MFRs.

We report simultaneous detection of twin kHz and ∼40 Hz quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) in the time-resolved analysis of the AstroSat/LAXPC observation of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary, 4U 1728-34. The frequencies of the multiple sets of triplets are correlated with each other and are consistent with their identification as the orbital, periastron precession, and twice the nodal precession frequencies. The observed relations, along with the known spin of the neutron star, put constraints on the mass and the ratio of the moment of inertia to the mass of the neutron star to be and under the simplistic assumption that the metric is a Kerr one. We crudely estimate that the mass and moment of inertia values obtained may differ by about 1% and 5%, respectively, if a self-consistent metric is invoked. Using the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equations for computing the moment of inertia of a neutron star in slow rotation approximation, having different equations of state, we find that the predicted values of neutron star parameters favor stiffer equations of state. We expect more stringent constraints would be obtained using a more detailed treatment, where the equation of state–dependent metric is used to compute the expected frequencies rather than the Kerr metric used here. The results provide insight into both the nature of these QPOs and the neutron star interior.

<div> Pulsar wind nebula, HESS J1849-000, PeV γ-ray photons, nonthermal radiative properties, particle transport

总结:<br /><br />本研究使用时间相关模型研究了HESS J1849-000的非热辐射特性。通过对观测到的多波段数据进行分析，发现相对论性的轻子通过同步辐射和反向 Compton 效应很好地解释了观测数据，同时分析了粒子的输运和冷却过程。研究结果表明，粒子的绝热损失在低能带中占主导地位，而扩散占优势。在高能带中，粒子的同步辐射损失占主导地位，扩散也占优势。此外，粒子输运在低能带中起着重要作用，而粒子的冷却过程在高能带中更为重要。在电子能量为1 TeV时，得到了当前的扩散系数为3.4 × 10^26 cm² s^-1，这暗示了在星云内可能存在着较慢的扩散机制。最重要的是，我们的模型表明粒子的最大能量为3.6 PeV，使得HESS J1849-000成为 PeV 天体的候选。 <div>
Pulsar wind nebula HESS J1849-000 is one of the sources that may emit PeV γ-ray photons based on the recent measurement by the Tibet Air Shower Array and the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory. We use a time-dependent model to investigate the nonthermal radiative properties of HESS J1849-000. Observed multiband data are produced well by relativistic leptons through synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton processes, and the particle transport and cooling processes are analyzed. Our results show that the particle adiabatic loss dominates over the synchrotron loss and inverse Compton losses, and the particle advection dominates over diffusion for the low-energy band. On the other hand, the particle synchrotron loss dominates over the adiabatic loss and inverse Compton losses, and the diffusion dominates over advection for the high-energy band. Furthermore, particle transport would be playing a significant role in the low-energy band, whereas the particle cooling processes may play a more important role in the high-energy band. The current diffusion coefficient 3.4 × 1026 cm2 s−1 at an electron energy of 1 TeV is derived, which implies a slow diffusion mechanism may occur within the nebula. More importantly, our model suggests that the particle's maximum energy is 3.6 PeV, which makes HESS J1849-000 a PeVatron candidate.

We present new Chandra X-ray observations of TAP 26, a ≈17 Myr old magnetically active weak-lined T Tauri star that has been reported to host a massive planet in a ≈10.8 day orbit. At a separation of a = 0.097 au the planet will be exposed to intense X-ray and UV radiation from the star. The first observation caught the star in a state of elevated X-ray emission with variability on a timescale of a few hours and an X-ray temperature kTx ≈ 2–4 keV. Two subsequent observations 5–10 days later showed slow variability and a lower X-ray flux and temperature (kTx ≈ 1 keV). We characterize the X-ray emission and estimate the X-ray ionization and heating rates that will need to be incorporated into realistic models of the planet’s atmosphere.

We present the first results of one extremely high-resolution, nonradiative magnetohydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulation of a massive cluster with a virial mass of Mvir = 2.0 × 1015 solar masses. We adopt a mass resolution of 4 × 105M⊙ with a maximum spatial resolution of around 250 pc in the central regions of the cluster. We follow the detailed amplification process in a resolved small-scale turbulent dynamo in the intracluster medium (ICM) with strong exponential growth until redshift 4, after which the field grows weakly in the adiabatic compression limit until redshift 2. The energy in the field is slightly reduced as the system approaches redshift zero in agreement with adiabatic decompression. The field structure is highly turbulent in the center and shows field reversals on a length scale of a few tens of kiloparsecs and an anticorrelation between the radial and angular field components in the central region that is ordered by small-scale turbulent dynamo action. The large-scale field on megaparsec scales is almost isotropic, indicating that the structure formation process in massive galaxy cluster formation suppresses any memory of both the initial field configuration and the amplified morphology via the turbulent dynamo. We demonstrate that extremely high-resolution simulations of the magnetized ICM are within reach that can simultaneously resolve the small-scale magnetic field structure, which is of major importance for the injection of and transport of cosmic rays in the ICM. This work is a major cornerstone for follow-up studies with an on-the-fly treatment of cosmic rays to model in detail electron-synchrotron and gamma-ray emissions.

We compute the accretion efficiency of small solids, with radii 1 cm ≤ Rs ≤ 10 m, on planets embedded in gaseous disks. Planets have masses 3 ≤ Mp ≤ 20 Earth masses (M⊕) and orbit within 10 au of a solar mass star. Disk thermodynamics is modeled via 3D radiation-hydrodynamics calculations that typically resolve the planetary envelopes. Both icy and rocky solids are considered, explicitly modeling their thermodynamic evolution. The maximum efficiencies of 1 ≤ Rs ≤ 100 cm particles are generally ≲10%, whereas 10 m solids tend to accrete efficiently or be segregated beyond the planet’s orbit. A simplified approach is applied to compute the accretion efficiency of small cores, with masses Mp ≤ 1 M⊕ and without envelopes, for which efficiencies are approximately proportional to . The mass flux of solids, estimated from unperturbed drag-induced drift velocities, provides typical accretion rates dMp/dt ≲ 10−5M⊕ yr−1. In representative disk models with an initial gas-to-dust mass ratio of 70–100 and total mass of 0.05–0.06 M⊙, the solids’ accretion falls below 10−6M⊕ yr−1 after 1–1.5 Myr. The derived accretion rates, as functions of time and planet mass, are applied to formation calculations that compute dust opacity self-consistently with the delivery of solids to the envelope. Assuming dust-to-solid coagulation times of ≈0.3 Myr and disk lifetimes of ≈3.5 Myr, heavy-element inventories in the range 3–7 M⊕ require that ≈90–150 M⊕ of solids cross the planet’s orbit. The formation calculations encompass a variety of outcomes, from planets a few times M⊕, predominantly composed of heavy elements, to giant planets. The peak luminosities during the epoch of the solids’ accretion range from ≈10−7 to ≈10−6L⊙.

MaDCoWS2是原MaDCoWS调查的后继者，使用更深入的光学和红外数据以及更强大的检测算法(PZWav)。利用DECaLS和CatWISE2020目录的光度数据，得出宽场红外巡天探测器(WISE)选择的星系的光度红移的全概率分布函数。利用PZWav算法检测三维星系密度过度，得到了22,970个星系团候选者的目录，跨越0.1 < z < 2的红移范围。与其他调查相比，MaDCoWS2重新发现了60%–92%的星团，且偏差较小。研究了信噪比和富度之间的关系表现出较小的散布。 <div>
The Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2 (MaDCoWS2) is a new survey designed as the successor of the original MaDCoWS survey. MaDCoWS2 improves upon its predecessor by using deeper optical and infrared data and a more powerful detection algorithm (PZWav). As input to the search, we use grz photometry from the DECam Legacy Survey (DECaLS) in combination with W1 and W2 photometry from the CatWISE2020 catalog to derive the photometric redshifts with full redshift probability distribution functions for Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)-selected galaxies. Cluster candidates are then detected using the PZWav algorithm to find three-dimensional galaxy overdensities from the sky positions and photometric redshifts. This paper provides the first MaDCoWS2 data release, covering 1461 (1838 without masking) deg2 centered on the Hyper-SuprimeCam Subaru Strategic Program equatorial fields. Within this region, we derive a catalog of 22,970 galaxy cluster candidates detected at a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) > 5. These clusters span the redshift range 0.1 < z < 2, including 1312 candidates at z > 1.5. We compare MaDCoWS2 to six existing catalogs in the area. We rediscover 60%–92% of the clusters in these surveys at S/N > 5. The medians of the absolute redshift offset are <0.02 relative to these surveys, while the standard deviations are less than 0.06. The median offsets between the detection position from MaDCoWS2 and other surveys are less than 0.25 Mpc. We quantify the relation between S/N and gas mass, total mass, luminosity, and richness from other surveys using a redshift-dependent power law relation. We find that the S/N-richness relation exhibits the lowest scatter.

总结:<br />
本文报道了利用Hobby-Eberly望远镜的低分辨率光谱仪对行星状星云Patchick 27（Pa 27）的中心星进行的光学光谱观测。光谱显示Pa 27为K0 III红巨星，但同时在近紫外波段也检测到了一个热的双星成分。研究还发现Pa 27表现出低幅度的7.36天正弦变化，可能是由于旋转和磁活跃的冷巨星表面出现恒星黑子导致的。Pa 27属于“A35型中心星”这一稀有类别，由一个有斑点的晚型恒星和一个热的白矮星前体组成。最后，研究提出了一些有用的后续观测建议。 <div>
We present optical spectroscopy of the 12th-magnitude central star of the planetary nebula (PN) Patchick 27 (Pa 27), obtained during a survey of faint PN nuclei (PNNs) with the Low-Resolution Spectrograph of the Hobby–Eberly Telescope. The optical spectrum of Pa 27 is that of a K0 III red giant with rotationally broadened lines. However, the star is detected in the near-ultraviolet (near-UV) with GALEX, showing that a hot binary component is also present. The spectral-energy distribution from the near-UV to the mid-infrared can be fitted with a combination of the K0 III giant and a hot PNN with an effective temperature of about 50,000 K. Photometric observations of Pa 27, both ground-based and from TESS, show a low-amplitude sinusoidal variation with a period of 7.36 days, probably due to starspots on a rotating and magnetically active cool giant. Pa 27 is a new member of the rare class of “A35-type central stars,” which are binary PNNs consisting of a spotted late-type star and a hot pre–white dwarf. They are likely the result of a situation where an asymptotic-giant-branch (AGB) star ejects its outer layers in a dense wind, part of which is captured by a distant companion, spinning up its rotation by accretion of material and angular momentum. We suggest several useful follow-up observations.

Summary: 
水星的轨道可能变得不稳定，导致与金星或太阳的碰撞。先前的工作将g1的变化近似为随机扩散，建立出一个可以在长达10亿年以上的时间尺度上复现水星不稳定统计的现象学模型。然而，新的研究表明，随机扩散模型在5亿年以下的时间尺度上显著低估了水星不稳定的概率。为了更好地模拟短时间尺度上的变化，研究人员建立了一个新的亚扩散现象学模型。他们选择了模型参数，使其能够在1到40亿年的时间尺度内复现水星的不稳定统计。这项工作引发了太阳系动力学领域的一些基本问题：为什么亚扩散更好地近似了g1的变化？为什么g1有一个上限，而没有阻止它达到g5的下限？<br /><br />总结: <br />水星可能与金星或太阳碰撞；现有的扩散模型无法准确预测水星不稳定性；新的亚扩散模型能够更好地模拟短时间尺度上的变化；这项工作引发了太阳系动力学领域的一些基本问题。 <div>
Mercury’s orbit can destabilize, generally resulting in a collision with either Venus or the Sun. Chaotic evolution can cause g1 to decrease to the approximately constant value of g5 and create a resonance. Previous work has approximated the variation in g1 as stochastic diffusion, which leads to a phenomological model that can reproduce the Mercury instability statistics of secular and N-body models on timescales longer than 10 Gyr. Here we show that the diffusive model significantly underpredicts the Mercury instability probability on timescales less than 5 Gyr, the remaining lifespan of the solar system. This is because g1 exhibits larger variations on short timescales than the diffusive model would suggest. To better model the variations on short timescales, we build a new subdiffusive phenomological model for g1. Subdiffusion is similar to diffusion but exhibits larger displacements on short timescales and smaller displacements on long timescales. We choose model parameters based on the behavior of the g1 trajectories in the N-body simulations, leading to a tuned model that can reproduce Mercury instability statistics from 1–40 Gyr. This work motivates fundamental questions in solar system dynamics: why does subdiffusion better approximate the variation in g1 than standard diffusion? Why is there an upper bound on g1, but not a lower bound that would prevent it from reaching g5?

<div> 红巨星，光谱观测，太空望远镜，Hubble Space Telescope，质量流失率
<br />总结:
研究使用哈勃空间望远镜上的STIS仪器对红巨星进行了光谱观测，发现早期K到中期M巨星主要表现为温暖的色球风。利用H i Lyα线的观察结果估算了红巨星的质量流失率，其中M巨星的流失率为M⊙ yr−1，而检测到流失吸收的K巨星具有较弱的流失率。此外，在观测两颗红巨星的光谱数据时发现了空间延展的Lyα发射，估算了可检测发射的极限范围。同时，也发现了Fe ii、Mg ii、Mg i、O i和C ii等线的空间特征。整体而言，M巨星的空间特征更为明显，与Lyα分析结果一致。 <div>
We describe recent spectroscopic observations of red giant stars made by the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument on board the Hubble Space Telescope, which has provided spatially resolved observations of the warm chromospheric winds that predominate for early K to mid-M giants. The H i Lyα lines of a set of 11 red giants observed with the STIS/E140M echelle grating are first analyzed to ascertain wind H i column densities and total wind mass-loss rates. The M giants have estimated mass-loss rates of M⊙ yr−1, while the K giants with detected wind absorption have weaker winds with M⊙ yr−1. We use long-slit spectra of H i Lyα for two particular red giants, α Tau (K5 III) and γ Cru (M3.5 III), to study the spatial extent of the Lyα emission. From these data we estimate limits for the extent of detectable emission, which are r = 193 R* for γ Cru and r = 44 R* for α Tau. The cross-dispersion emission profiles in the STIS echelle spectra of the larger sample of red giants also show evidence for spatial resolution, not only for H i Lyα but for other lines with visible wind absorption, such as Fe ii, Mg ii, Mg i, O i, and C ii. We characterize the nature of these spatial signatures. The spatial extent is far more apparent for the M giants than for the K giants, consistent with the stronger winds found for the M giants from the Lyα analysis.

<div> 关键词: 太阳能电池，Habitable Worlds Observatory，技术标志，外星文明，能源利用<br />
总结: 本研究评估了类地外行星上由硅制成的太阳能电池作为潜在技术标志的可能性。通过对近红外和可见光范围内的高反射特性进行评估，发现使用类似Habitable Worlds Observatory telescop的8米望远镜需要数百个小时的观测时间才能在10光年外的类太阳恒星附近的地球样行星上达到一定的信噪比。此外，论文还讨论了Kardeshev Type I/II文明和戴森球等概念在能源利用方面的作用，最后指出，即使是未来的人类文明也不太可能发展成为银河系范围的文明，因为能源需求存在一定的限制。 <br /> <div>
In this work, we assess the potential detectability of solar panels made of silicon on an Earth-like exoplanet as a potential technosignature. Silicon-based photovoltaic cells have high reflectance in the ultraviolet-to-visible (UV-VIS) and in the near-infrared, within the wavelength range of a space-based flagship mission concept like the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). Assuming that only solar energy is used to provide the 2022 human energy needs with a land cover of ∼2.4%, and projecting the future energy demand assuming various growth-rate scenarios, we assess the detectability with an 8 m HWO-like telescope. Assuming the most favorable viewing orientation, and focusing on the strong absorption edge in the UV-VIS (0.34–0.52 μm), we find that several hundreds of hours of observation time are needed to reach a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 for an Earth-like planet around a Sun-like star at 10 pc, even with a solar panel coverage of ∼23% land coverage of a future Earth. We discuss the necessity of concepts like Kardeshev Type I/II civilizations and Dyson spheres, which would aim to harness vast amounts of energy. Even with much larger populations than today, the total energy use of human civilization would be orders of magnitude below the threshold for causing direct thermal heating or reaching the scale of a Kardashev Type I civilization. Any extraterrestrial civilization that likewise achieves sustainable population levels may also find a limit on its need to expand, which suggests that a galaxy-spanning civilization as imagined in the Fermi paradox may not exist.

<div> ICMEs, solar wind, Vip, heavy ions, coronal abundance
总结:
本研究通过对ICMEs和太阳风中He2+、C5+、O6+和Fe10+的离子-质子差速进行统计研究，发现太阳风中Vip随着距离太阳的减小而增加，而在ICMEs中保持不变。因此，通过1天文单位附近的原位丰度推断日冕源的绝对丰度可能存在问题。然而，高兴的是，氧离子（O6+）的差速（Vio）在ICMEs和太阳风中都可以忽略不计，这意味着各种重离子总是以相同的速度流动，它们在1天文单位附近的相对丰度可以代表ICMEs和太阳风的日冕丰度。 <div>
The elemental abundance of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) and solar wind near 1 au is often adopted to represent the abundance in the corresponding coronal sources. However, the absolute abundance of heavy ions (relative to hydrogen) near 1 au might be different from the coronal abundance due to the ion–proton differential speed (Vip). To illustrate the Vip characteristics and explore whether it influences the absolute abundance analysis for ICMEs and solar wind, we perform a statistical study on the Vip for He2+, C5+, O6+, and Fe10+ in both ICMEs and solar wind based on measurements of Advanced Composition Explorer. The results show that the Vip is negligible within ICMEs and slow solar wind (< 400 km s−1), while obvious in the intermediate (400–600 km s−1) and fast wind (> 600 km s−1). Previous studies showed that the Vip in ICMEs keeps negligible during propagation from 0.3 to 5 au, but in solar wind it increases with the decreasing heliocentric distance. Therefore, it might be questionable to infer the absolute abundance of coronal sources through in situ abundance near 1 au for solar wind. Fortunately, the ion–oxygen (O6+) differential speed (Vio) is negligible for He2+, C5+, and Fe10+ within both ICMEs and solar wind, and previous studies suggested that the Vio does not vary significantly with the heliocentric distance. This indicates that various heavy ions always flow at the same bulk speed and their relative abundance (relative to oxygen) near 1 au can represent the coronal abundance for both ICMEs and solar wind.

<div> 关键词: NYMGs, β-Pictoris moving group, Age estimation, Kinematic traceback analysis, Systematic reevaluation
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了附近年轻移动星团（NYMGs）年龄估计的重要性，特别是β-Pictoris 移动星团（BPMG）的年龄。研究使用了三种方法确定了BPMG的运动学年龄，得出的估计年龄在14-20 Myr之间。通过对径向速度进行校正后，得出的年龄比之前的估计年龄年轻了2-4 Myr。这一年龄远小于之前通过锂耗尽边界分析确定的年龄（24 Myr），这可能指出了流明演化和锂耗损模型之间的差异或者方法中存在未考虑的系统误差。因此，迫切需要对附近年轻移动星团的年龄估计方法进行系统重新评估。 <div>
Accurate age estimation of nearby young moving groups (NYMGs) is important as they serve as crucial testbeds in various fields of astrophysics, including the formation and evolution of stars and planets, as well as loose stellar associations. The β-Pictoris moving group (BPMG), being one of the closest and youngest NYMGs, has been extensively investigated, and its estimated ages have a wide range from ∼10–25 Myr, depending on the age estimation methods and data used. Unlike other age dating methods, kinematic traceback analysis offers a model-independent age assessment hence the merit in comparing many seemingly discordant age estimates. In this study, we determine the kinematic ages of the BPMG using three methods: probabilistic volume calculation, mean pairwise distance calculation, and covariance matrix analysis. These methods yield consistent results, with estimated ages in the range of 14–20 Myr. Implementing corrections to radial velocities due to gravitational redshift and convectional blueshift increases the ages by ∼2–4 Myr. Conversely, considering data uncertainties decreases the estimated ages by 1–2 Myr. Taken together, our analysis determined the kinematic age of the BPMG to be Myr. This age is significantly younger than the commonly accepted age of the BPMG (∼24 Myr) determined primarily from the lithium depletion boundary analysis. This younger kinematic age may point to the discrepancy between the luminosity evolution and lithium depletion models or the presence of unaccounted systematic error in the method. This result underscores the necessity for systematic reevaluations of age-dating methods for nearby, young moving groups.

The distribution of magnetic energy across scales, represented by the turbulence spectrum, provides insights into magnetic field dynamics in astrophysical and space plasma. While the Earth’s magnetosheath exhibits a conventional two-slope spectrum, the Martian magnetosheath often displays a prominent plateau-like spectrum. However, the underlying physical mechanism remains unresolved. Based on MAVEN observations, we present appealing evidence of pickup ions (PUIs) modulating the plateau-like spectrum through proton cyclotron waves (PCWs). PCWs, driven by unstable pickup H+ ion distributions, significantly influence the formation of plateau-like spectra. Both case and statistical studies suggest that the spectral evolution is affected by the relative abundance of pickup O+ ions. A substantial presence of pickup O+ ions can suppress PCWs driven by pickup H+ ions, resulting in a decline in the slope of the plateau spectrum. Particle-in-cell simulations confirm the role of PUI-modulated PCWs in the plateau-range energy injection. Our results provide new insight into the impact of PUIs on magnetic turbulence evolution and associated energy transfer processes in space and astrophysical plasma.

<div> Haro 11, Lyman continuum emitter, escape processes, Hubble Space Telescope, ultraluminous X-ray sources
<br /><br />
总结: 作为距离最近的已确认的Lyman连续辐射(LyC)发射体，Haro 11是研究宇宙再电离关键过程的重要实验室。通过观察其三个星形成结，发现LyC源于B和C结，其903-912 Å的亮度分别为1.9 ± 1.5 × 1040 erg s−1和0.9 ± 0.7 × 1040 erg s−1。我们推导出Knots B和C的局部逃逸分数fesc,912分别为3.4% ± 2.9%和5.1% ± 4.3% 。Starburst99建模显示每个结中的主要群体在1-4 Myr和1-2 × 10^7M⊙，Knot B中拥有最年轻的群体。因此，拥有最强LyC检测的结具有最高的LyC产生率。然而，由于更高的中性气体覆盖，Knot B中的LyC逃逸可能不如Knot C。我们的研究强调了内在的电离亮度的重要性，而不仅仅是逃逸分数，对于LyC的检测也是如此。类似地，Lyα逃逸分数并未始终与LyC流量相关，狭窄的Lyα红峰也不符合这一规律。然而，观察到较高的Lyα亮度和较低的Lyα红峰速度分离与更高的LyC逃逸相关。未检测到的Knot A显示出绿豆星系的特性，密度边界条件暗示高度各向异性的LyC逃逸。最后，LyC泄漏的B和C结都有超亮X射线源(ULXs)。尽管星星在LyC发射中占据主导地位，但这个有趣的巧合强调了揭示吸积体在LyC逃逸和再电离中的作用的重要性。 <div>
As the nearest confirmed Lyman continuum (LyC) emitter, Haro 11 is an exceptional laboratory for studying LyC escape processes crucial to cosmic reionization. Our new Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph G130M/1055 observations of its three star-forming knots now reveal that the observed LyC originates in Knots B and C, with 903–912 Å luminosities of 1.9 ± 1.5 × 1040 erg s−1 and 0.9 ± 0.7 × 1040 erg s−1, respectively. We derive local escape fractions fesc,912 = 3.4% ± 2.9% and 5.1% ± 4.3% for Knots B and C, respectively. Our Starburst99 modeling shows dominant populations on the order of ∼1–4 Myr and 1–2 × 107M⊙ in each knot, with the youngest population in Knot B. Thus, the knot with the strongest LyC detection has the highest LyC production. However, LyC escape is likely less efficient in Knot B than in Knot C due to higher neutral gas covering. Our results therefore stress the importance of the intrinsic ionizing luminosity, and not just the escape fraction, for LyC detection. Similarly, the Lyα escape fraction does not consistently correlate with LyC flux, nor do narrow Lyα red peaks. High observed Lyα luminosity and low Lyα peak velocity separation, however, do correlate with higher LyC escape. Another insight comes from the undetected Knot A, which drives the Green Pea properties of Haro 11. Its density-bounded conditions suggest highly anisotropic LyC escape. Finally, both of the LyC-leaking Knots, B and C, host ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). While stars strongly dominate over the ULXs in LyC emission, this intriguing coincidence underscores the importance of unveiling the role of accretors in LyC escape and reionization.

总结:
该研究基于包括504个L、T和Y矮星在内的最新的容积限制样本，提出了迄今为止对太阳附近单个超冷矮星的质量和年龄分布的最精确的约束。通过使用修正不完整性的统计学方法，他们获得了L0–Y2光谱类型的空间密度为pc-3。他们还计算了样本的辐射通量，使用了最新的“超级星等”方法来处理最暗的物体。通过使用得到的光度函数和基于似然的种群合成方法，他们同时约束了质量和年龄分布。他们的分析发现质量函数的指数为-0.64±0.12，表明了向较低质量物体的数量增加，与附近的星形成区域的测量结果一致。此外，他们还发现年龄分布的指数β为-0.44±0.14，表明了比通常假设的更少的老年天体，这可能反映了银河系平面的动力加热和历史上的棕矮星产生率。与Kirkpatrick等人的分析进行比较后，虽然质量函数的测量结果数值上是一致的，但他们对于年龄分布的假设在该研究中被否定，并且该研究还指出了两个研究之间的一些重要的方法论差异。该研究对太阳附近棕矮星的年龄分布的计算是基于容积限制样本的，这是首次的。 <div>
We present the most precise constraints to date for the mass and age distributions of single ultracool dwarfs in the solar neighborhood, based on an updated volume-limited sample of 504 L, T, and Y dwarfs within 25 pc. We develop a Monte Carlo approach using the statistic to correct for incompleteness and obtain a space density of pc−3 for spectral types L0–Y2. We calculate bolometric luminosities for our sample, using an updated “super-magnitude” method for the faintest objects. We use our resulting luminosity function and a likelihood-based population synthesis approach to simultaneously constrain the mass and age distributions. We employ the fraction of young L0–L7 dwarfs as a novel input for this analysis that is crucial for constraining the age distribution. For a power-law mass function , we find , indicating an increase in numbers toward lower masses, consistent with measurements in nearby star-forming regions. For an exponential age distribution b(t) ∝ e−βt we find β = −0.44 ± 0.14, i.e., a population with fewer old objects than often assumed, which may reflect dynamical heating of the Galactic plane as much as the historical brown dwarf birthrate. We compare our analysis to that of Kirkpatrick et al., who used a similar volume-limited sample. Although our mass function measurements are numerically consistent, their assumption of a flat age distribution is disfavored by our analysis, and we identify several important methodological differences between our two studies. Our calculation of the age distribution of solar neighborhood brown dwarfs is the first based on a volume-limited sample.

总结: 该研究利用JWST为地球外行星大气特征的观测数据，探讨了H2O交叉分区在光化学反应中的影响。研究结果表明，更新的H2O交叉分区数据对模拟行星大气中追踪气体的丰度产生了显著影响，尤其是在太阳类恒星周围的无氧行星上，这种影响尤为明显。在未来直接成像任务中，这些差异将导致模拟行星光谱出现可观测的变化。这项研究强调了H2O及其他关键分子的交叉分区数据在中紫外波长(>200nm)上的需求。 <div>
JWST has created a new era of terrestrial exoplanet atmospheric characterization, and with it, the possibility to detect potential biosignature gases like CH4. Our interpretation of exoplanet atmospheric spectra, and the veracity of these interpretations, will be limited by our understanding of atmospheric processes and the accuracy of input modeling data. Molecular cross sections are essential inputs to these models. The photochemistry of temperate planets depends on photolysis reactions whose rates are governed by the dissociation cross sections of key molecules. H2O is one such molecule; the photolysis of H2O produces OH, a highly reactive and efficient sink for atmospheric trace gases. We investigate the photochemical effects of improved H2O cross sections on anoxic terrestrial planets as a function of host star spectral type and CH4 surface flux. Our results show that updated H2O cross sections, extended to wavelengths >200 nm, substantially impact the predicted abundances of trace gases destroyed by OH. The differences for anoxic terrestrial planets orbiting Sun-like host stars are greatest, showing changes of up to 3 orders of magnitude in surface CO levels, and over an order of magnitude in surface CH4 levels. These differences lead to observable changes in simulated planetary spectra, especially important in the context of future direct-imaging missions. In contrast, the atmospheres of planets orbiting M-dwarf stars are substantially less affected. Our results demonstrate a pressing need for refined dissociation cross-section data for H2O, where uncertainties remain, and other key molecules, especially at mid-UV wavelengths >200 nm.

通过VLBA观测LP 349-25AB的11个时段，发现这个接近的双星系统的两个成分，并通过非线性最小二乘法、遗传算法和马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛方法确定了它们的轨道参数。主要成分和次要成分的质量分别为0.08188 ± 0.00061 M⊙ 和 0.06411 ± 0.00049 M⊙，表示迄今为止超冷矮星（UCD）的最精确质量估计之一。这是对棕矮星进行VLBA观测的少数直接检测之一。我们还测得该双星系统的距离为14.122 ± 0.057 pc。使用恒星演化模型，我们找到了两颗星的模型推导的恒星参数。特别是，我们得到了该系统的模型推导年龄为262百万年，表明LP 349-25AB由两颗前主序星组成。此外，我们还发现次要恒星的演化程度明显低于主要恒星。<br /><br />总结: LP 349-25是一个由两颗迟M型矮星组成的双星系统，通过VLBA观测得到了它们的质量、距离和演化信息。这是对LP 349-25AB进行了最精确的质量估计，并且少数直接检测出棕矮星的观测之一。 <div>
LP 349−25 is a well-studied close stellar binary system comprised of two late M dwarf stars, where both stars are close to the limit between star and brown dwarf. This system was previously identified as a source of gigahertz radio emission. We observed LP 349−25AB over 11 epochs in 2020–2022, detecting both components in this nearby binary system using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). We fit simultaneously the VLBA absolute astrometric positions together with existing relative astrometric observations derived from optical/infrared observations with a set of algorithms that use nonlinear least-squares, genetic algorithm, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to determine the orbital parameters of the two components. We find the masses of the primary and secondary components to be 0.08188 ± 0.00061 M⊙ and 0.06411 ± 0.00049 M⊙, respectively, representing one of the most precise mass estimates of any ultracool dwarf (UCD) to date. The primary is a UCD of 85.71 ± 0.64 MJup, while the secondary has a mass consistent with being a brown dwarf of 67.11 ± 0.51 MJup. This is one of the very few direct detections of a brown dwarf with VLBA observations. We also find a distance to the binary system of 14.122 ± 0.057 pc. Using stellar evolutionary models, we find the model-derived stellar parameters of both stars. In particular, we obtain a model-derived age of 262 Myr for the system, which indicates that LP 349−25AB is composed of two pre–main-sequence stars. In addition, we find that the secondary star is significantly less evolved than the primary star.

<div> 高分辨率，局部等热流体动力学模拟，行星-盘相互作用，轨道阻尼时标，类型I和类型II迁移

这篇文章扩展了作者之前的研究，利用高分辨率的三维局部等热流体动力学模拟，研究了行星在盘中的轨道阻尼效果。文章发现，行星在盘中切出的部分空隙深度会直线调制离心率阻尼效率，同样影响倾斜阻尼效率。在低黏度情况下，空隙深度达到一定程度会出现涡旋，导致类型I和类型II迁移状态的转变。作者还提出了简单的拟合公式，用于描述轨道阻尼时标与空隙深度的关系，该公式在N-body模拟中可以用于模拟行星-盘相互作用。最后，作者展示了他们的轨道阻尼模型对群体合成实验结果的影响。<br /><br />总结: 本研究利用高分辨率的三维局部等热流体动力学模拟扩展了之前的研究，发现行星在盘中的轨道阻尼受部分空隙深度的影响，提出了简单的拟合公式描述了轨道阻尼时标与空隙深度的关系，并展示了模型对群体合成实验结果的影响。 <div>
In a previous paper, we showed that, like the migration speed, the eccentricity damping efficiency is modulated linearly by the depth of the partial gap a planet carves in the disk surface density profile, resulting in less efficient e-damping compared to the prescription commonly used in population synthesis works. Here, we extend our analysis to 3D, refining our e-damping formula and studying how the inclination damping efficiency is also affected. We perform high-resolution 3D locally isothermal hydrodynamical simulations of planets with varying masses embedded in disks with varying aspect ratios and viscosities. We extract the gap profile and orbital damping timescales for fixed eccentricities and inclinations up to the disk scale height. The limit in gap depths below which vortices appear, in the low-viscosity case, happens roughly at the transition between classical type-I and type-II migration regimes. The orbital damping timescales can be described by two linear trends with a break around gap depths ∼80% and with slopes and intercepts depending on the eccentricity and inclination. These trends are understood on physical grounds and are reproduced by simple fitting formulas whose error is within the typical uncertainty of type-I torque formulas. Thus, our recipes for the gap depth and orbital damping efficiencies yield a simple description for planet–disk interactions to use in N-body codes in the case of partial-gap opening planets that is consistent with high-resolution 3D hydrosimulations. Finally, we show examples of how our novel orbital damping prescription can affect the outcome of population synthesis experiments.

We present an imaging survey of the Spitzer I star-forming region in NGC 6822 conducted with the NIRCam and MIRI instruments on board JWST. Located at a distance of 490 kpc, NGC 6822 is the nearest non-interacting low-metallicity (∼0.2 Z⊙) dwarf galaxy. It hosts some of the brightest known H ii regions in the local universe, including recently discovered sites of highly embedded active star formation. Of these, Spitzer I is the youngest and most active, and houses 90 color-selected candidate young stellar objects (YSOs) identified from Spitzer Space Telescope observations. We revisit the YSO population of Spitzer I with these new JWST observations. By analyzing color–magnitude diagrams constructed with NIRCam and MIRI data, we establish color selection criteria and construct spectral energy distributions to identify candidate YSOs and characterize the full population of young stars, from the most embedded phase to the more evolved stages. In this way, we have identified 140 YSOs in Spitzer I. Comparing to previous Spitzer studies of the NGC 6822 YSO population, we find that the YSOs we identify are fainter and less massive, indicating that the improved resolution of JWST allows us to resolve previously blended sources into multiple objects.

<div> cosmic microwave background, inflation, Planck time, primordial power spectrum, alternative cosmologies
总结:<br />
该论文讨论了对宇宙微波背景的研究，通过对传统通用相对论模型中膨胀参数空间的逐步细化，发现膨胀理论存在一些不确定性和矛盾。新的缓慢膨胀模型需要在普朗克时间之后启动，但这可能会导致一些问题，比如缺乏合理的初始条件，量子化早期涨落的困难等。然而，通过引入非常规的膨胀修正，如暂时脱离缓慢膨胀动力学，多场驱动膨胀，或与引力的非最小耦合，可以避免这些问题。此外，基于循环量子引力的替代宇宙学也可能有助于解决这些困难。 <div>
Space-based missions studying the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have progressively refined the parameter space in conventional models of inflation shortly (∼10−37 s) after the Big Bang. While most inflationary scenarios proposed thus far in the context of general relativity have since been ruled out, the basic idea of inflation may still be tenable, albeit with several unresolved conundrums, such as conflicting initial conditions and inconsistencies with the measured CMB power spectrum. In the new slow-roll inflationary picture, inflation arising in plateau-like potentials requires an initiation beyond the Planck time. This delay may be consistent with the cutoff, , measured recently in the primordial power spectrum. However, the actual value of would imply an initiation time too far beyond the Big Bang for inflation to solve the horizon problem. In this paper, we also describe several other undesirable consequences of this delay, including an absence of well-motivated initial conditions and a significant difficulty in providing a viable mechanism for properly quantizing the primordial fluctuations. Nevertheless, many of these inconsistencies may still be avoided if one introduces nonconventional modifications to inflation, such as a brief departure from slow-roll dynamics, possibly due to a dramatic change in the inflationary potential, inflation driven by multiple fields, or a nonminimal coupling to gravity. In addition, some of these difficulties could be mitigated via the use of alternative cosmologies based, e.g., on loop quantum gravity, which replaces the initial Big Bang singularity with finite conditions at a bounce-like beginning.

<title>Finding the Particularity of the Active Episode of SGR J1935+2154 during Which FRB 20200428 Occurred: Implication from Statistics of Fermi/GBM X-Ray Bursts</title>

<div> 关键词: Fermi/Gamma-ray Burst Monitor, SGR J1935+2154, X-ray bursts, self-organized critical system, fast radio burst (FRB)
总结:<br />
本研究利用Fermi/Gamma-ray Burst Monitor数据对SGR J1935+2154的X射线爆发进行了研究，发现爆发在FRB 20200428期间的等待时间明显较短，且XRBs的统计特性表明它们可能属于自组织临界系统，类似于地震现象。根据地震等待时间和能量以及余震之间的统一缩放定律，对XRBs进行了类比分析，发现FRB期间的爆发事件更加相互依赖。这表明FRB可能是由不同爆发事件之间的相互作用产生的，这可能对应于磁星进入全球密集活动期间时出现的不同地震/阿尔文波或不同爆炸流的碰撞情景。 <div>
By using the Fermi/Gamma-ray Burst Monitor data of the X-ray bursts (XRBs) of SGR J1935+2154, we investigate the temporal clustering of the bursts and the cumulative distribution of the waiting time and fluence/flux. It is found that the bursts occurring in the episode hosting FRB 20200428 have obviously shorter waiting times than those in the other episodes. The general statistical properties of the XRBs further indicate they could belong to a self-organized critical system (e.g., starquakes), making them very similar to the earthquake phenomena. Then, according to a unified scaling law between the waiting time and energy of the earthquakes as well as their aftershocks, we implement an analogy analysis on the XRBs and find that the fast radio burst (FRB) episode owns more dependent burst events than the other episodes. It is indicated that the FRB emission could be produced by the interaction between different burst events, which could correspond to a collision between different seismic/Alfvén waves or different explosion outflows. Such a situation could appear when the magnetar enters into a global intensive activity period.

总结: 本文通过研究HESS J1731-347和PSR J0952-0607等紧凑星的质量数据，以及CREX实验对Ca的中子皮厚度的测量，挑战和约束了密集物质模型。研究者提出了包含夸克核心和核外包层的混合星模型，并用81个核方程状态和常速声速的夸克物质方程状态进行了测试。通过这些模型的对比，研究者发现低密度软核方程状态更符合J1731-347数据，而高密度硬核方程状态更符合J0592-0607和J0740+6620数据。研究者还观察到在一些模型中可能存在双子星配置，最终得出结论，通过J1731-347的数据，低质量双子星的最大质量在2.0-2.6 M⊙之间。 <br /><br /> <div>
Recent astrophysical mass inferences of compact stars HESS J1731-347 and PSR J0952-0607, with extremely small and large masses respectively, as well as the measurement of the neutron skin of Ca in the CREX experiment challenge and constrain the models of dense matter. We examine the concept of hybrid stars—objects containing quark cores surrounded by nucleonic envelopes—as models that account for these new data along with other inferences. We employ a family of 81 nucleonic equations of state (EOSs) with variable skewness and slope of symmetry energy at saturation density and a constant speed-of-sound EOS for quark matter. For each nucleonic EOS, a family of hybrid EOSs is generated by varying the transition density, the energy jump, and the speed of sound. These models are tested against the data from GW170817 and J1731-347, which favor low-density soft EOS and J0592-0607 and J0740+6620, which require high-density stiff EOS. The addition of J0592-0607's mass measurement to the constraints has no significant impact on the parameter space of the admissible EOS, but allows us to explore the potential effect of pulsars more massive than J0740+6620, if such exists. We then examine the occurrence of twin configurations and quantify the ranges of masses and radii that they can possess. It is shown that including J1731-347 data favors EOSs that predict low-mass twins with M ≲ 1.3 M⊙ that can be realized if the deconfinement transition density is low. If combined with large speed of sound in quark matter such models allow for maximum masses of hybrid stars in 2.0–2.6 M⊙.

The SEP instrument on board the MAVEN spacecraft at Mars is designed to measure charged particle fluxes and energies. In this work, we show that the SEP Si detectors have detected populations of secondary charged particles and low-energy primary photons from the GRB. Our analysis relies on a series of simplified Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations. We show that electromagnetic and hadronic interactions between the GRB photons and the spacecraft’s passive material and Si detectors produced the detected secondary particles.

<title>Analytical Study of Damped Standing Longitudinal MHD Waves in Flowing Coronal Loops: The Effect of Thermal Conduction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The longitudinal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) oscillations of coronal loops have been investigated in dissipative flowing loops. Thermal conduction has been considered as the damping mechanism of the wave. We aim to construct the damped longitudinal waves by superposing two propagating waves that propagate in opposite directions. The two propagating components must have the same oscillation frequencies and damping rates, which has been described impossible by some authors, but we have used a technique to overcome this difficulty. The equations of motion are combined to obtain a differential equation for the velocity perturbation. Using the weak damping condition, the perturbation method is used to solve the dispersion relation. In the leading order approximation, the oscillation frequency of the standing waves is determined. In the first-order approximation, we let both the oscillation frequency and wavelength of the propagating waves be perturbed due to the presence of thermal conduction, which enables us to determine the damping rate of the standing waves. Our results show that the plasma flow is an essential parameter in determining the effectiveness of the damping mechanism. Also, the exact solutions of the dispersion relation have been determined without using weak damping assumption. Interestingly the two solutions are the same. Introducing plasma flow to the coronal loop causes the period ratio of the fundamental mode to the first overtone to decrease more.

We present NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations covering the NGC 1977 region at 3.0, 6.4, and 15.0 GHz. We search for compact radio sources and detect continuum emission from 34 NGC 1977 cluster members and 37 background objects. Of the 34 radio-detected cluster members, 3 are associated with known proplyds in NGC 1977, 22 are associated with additional young stellar objects in NGC 1977, and 9 are newly identified cluster members. We examine the radio spectral energy distributions, circular polarization, and variability of the detected NGC 1977 sources and identify 10 new candidate proplyds whose radio fluxes are dominated by optically thin free–free emission. We use measurements of free–free emission to calculate the mass-loss rates of known proplyds and new candidate proplyds in NGC 1977, and find values ∼10−9 to 10−8M⊙ yr−1, which are lower than the mass-loss rates measured toward proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster but consistent with the mass-loss rates predicted by external photoevaporation models for spatially extended disks that are irradiated by the typical external ultraviolet (UV) fields encountered in NGC 1977. Finally, we show that photoevaporative disk winds in NGC 1977 may be illuminated by internal or external sources of ionization, depending on their positions within the cluster. This study provides new constraints on disk properties in a clustered star-forming region with a weaker UV environment than the Orion Nebula Cluster but a stronger UV environment than low-mass star-forming regions like Taurus. Such intermediate UV environments represent the typical conditions of Galactic star and planet formation.

M15 is a globular cluster with a known spread in neutron-capture elements. This paper presents abundances of neutron-capture elements for 62 stars in M15. Spectra were obtained with the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System spectrograph, covering a wavelength range from ∼4430 to 4630 Å. Spectral lines from Fe i, Fe ii, Sr i, Zr ii, Ba ii, La ii, Ce ii, Nd ii, Sm ii, Eu ii, and Dy ii were measured, enabling classifications and neutron-capture abundance patterns for the stars. Of the 62 targets, 44 are found to be highly Eu-enhanced r-II stars, another 17 are moderately Eu-enhanced r-I stars, and one star is found to have an s-process signature. The neutron-capture patterns indicate that the majority of the stars are consistent with enrichment by the r-process. The 62 target stars are found to show significant star-to-star spreads in Sr, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu, and Dy, but no significant spread in Fe. The neutron-capture abundances are further found to have slight correlations with sodium abundances from the literature, unlike what has been previously found; follow-up studies are needed to verify this result. The findings in this paper suggest that the Eu-enhanced stars in M15 were enhanced by the same process, that the nucleosynthetic source of this Eu pollution was the r-process, and that the r-process source occurred as the first generation of cluster stars was forming.

We conduct an in-depth spectral analysis of ∼1 Ms XMM-Newton data of the narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxy RE J1034+396. The long exposure ensures high spectral quality and provides us with a detailed look at the intrinsic absorption and emission features toward this target. Two warm-absorber (WA) components with different ionization states ( and ) are required to explain the intrinsic absorption features in the Reflection Grating Spectrometer spectra. The estimated outflow velocities are around −1400 km s−1 and −(100–300) km s−1 for the high- and low-ionization WA components, respectively. Both absorbers are located beyond the broad-line region and cannot significantly affect the host environment. We analyze the warm absorbers in different flux states. We also examine the 2007 May observation in the low and high phases of quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO). In contrast to previous analyses showing a negative correlation between the high-ionization WA and the QPO phase, we have found no such variation in this WA component. We discover a broad emission bump in the spectral range of ∼12–18 Å, covering the primary features of the high-ionization WA. This emission bump shows a dramatic change in different source states, and its intensity may positively correlate with the QPO phase. The absence of this emission bump in previous work may contribute to the suggested WA–QPO connection.

在这项研究中，我们使用平滑粒子流体动力学模拟探索超大质量黑洞对L*星系的星际介质和星系周围介质的影响。我们从25Mpc的宇宙体积Romulus25中选取了140个星等质量在log(M*/M⊙) = 9.5–11.5之间的星系进行分析。我们测量了每个星系星际介质和星系周围介质中金属的比例，并根据MBH–σ关系(Kormendy & Ho 2013)计算了每个超大质量黑洞的预期质量。我们发现，吸积质量超过MBH–σ的超大质量黑洞比质量不足的黑洞在抑制星系总体形成和将金属从星际介质排放到星系周围介质方面更为有效。然而，与其他模拟不同的是，我们观察到星系周围介质中的气体几乎没有从星系的暗物质晕中排放出去。最后，我们预测L*星系的C iv柱密度不太可能受宿主星系超大质量黑洞质量的影响。我们的结果表明，MBH–σ关系低质量端的离散可能表示一个超大质量黑洞在其宿主星系中局部质量再分布的有效性。 <br /><br />总结: 超大质量黑洞对星系的影响、金属流动、星系形成的抑制、气体的排放、C iv柱密度预测。 <div>
The interaction between supermassive black hole (SMBH) feedback and the circumgalactic medium (CGM) continues to be an open question in galaxy evolution. In our study, we use smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to explore the impact of SMBH feedback on galactic metal retention and the motion of metals and gas into and through the CGM of L* galaxies. We examine 140 galaxies from the 25 Mpc cosmological volume Romulus25, with stellar masses between log(M*/M⊙) = 9.5–11.5. We measure the fraction of metals remaining in the interstellar medium (ISM) and CGM of each galaxy and calculate the expected mass of each SMBH based on the MBH–σ relation (Kormendy & Ho 2013). The deviation of each SMBH from its expected mass, ΔMBH, is compared to the potential of its host via σ. We find that SMBHs with accreted mass above MBH–σ are more effective at removing metals from the ISM than undermassive SMBHs in star-forming galaxies. Overall, overmassive SMBHs suppress the total star formation of their host galaxies and more effectively move metals from the ISM into the CGM. However, we see little to no evacuation of gas from the CGM out of their halos, in contrast with other simulations. Finally, we predict that C iv column densities in the CGM of L* galaxies are unlikely to depend on host galaxy SMBH mass. Our results show that the scatter in the low-mass end of the MBH–σ relation may indicate how effective an SMBH is in the local redistribution of mass in its host galaxy.

<div> Monte Carlo simulation, X-ray resonant-line emission, supernova remnants, RS effect, physical properties<br /><br />总结:
本文使用蒙特卡洛模拟了超新星遗迹中X射线共振线辐射的共振散射效应。研究发现RS效应在边缘区域最为显著，造成线谱的非对称性，并且使得线辐射的表面亮度在不同区域有所变化。在Cygnus Loop的观测数据中，O vii Heα r线的G-比可以被RS影响而显著提高。此外，对Cas A等以喷射物为主导阶段的超新星遗迹进行的额外模拟结果表明，RS在冲击喷射物中可能会明显影响氧共振线的观测特性。 <div>
Resonant scattering (RS) of X-ray line emission in supernova remnants (SNRs) may modify the observed line profiles and fluxes and has a potential impact on estimating the physical properties of the hot gas and hence on understanding the SNR physics, but has not been theoretically modeled ever. Here we present our Monte Carlo simulation of the RS effect on X-ray resonant-line emission, typified by the O vii Heα r line, from SNRs. We employ the physical conditions characterized by the Sedov–Taylor solution and some basic parameters similar to those in Cygnus Loop. We show that the impact of the RS effect is most significant near the edge of the remnant. The line profiles are predicted to be asymmetric because of different temperatures and photon production efficiencies of the expanding gas at different radii. We also predict the surface brightness of the line emission would decrease in the outer projected region but is slightly enhanced in the inner. The G-ratio of the O vii Heα triplet can be effectively elevated by RS in the outer region. We show that the RS effect of the O vii Heα r line in the southwestern boundary region of Cygnus Loop is nonnegligible. The observed O vii G-ratio of ∼1.8 of the region could be achieved with RS taken into account for properly elevated O abundance from the previous estimates. Additional simulation performed for the SNRs in ejecta-dominated phases like Cas A shows that RS in the shocked ejecta may have some apparent effects on the observational properties of oxygen-resonant lines.

GJ 1148系统包括两颗类土星质量的行星围绕着一个M型矮星在星系结构上呈现出层级和离心轨道运动，这两颗行星的轨道周期比为13，离心率均为0.375。通过数值实验研究了行星-行星散射模型对这种轨道结构的形成过程。研究考虑了初始GJ 1148系统中第三颗质量为0.1MJ的行星，初始轨道间隔为3.5、4和4.5个相互希尔半径，并且内行星的初始半长轴范围为0.10-0.50 au。大多数散射结果都导致了行星-行星碰撞，随后是行星被抛出和行星-星体近距离接近。在这些结果中，只有行星被抛出产生了轨道离心率大且相互分离的两行星系统，其中一些具有与GJ 1148系统相似的轨道特性。研究还考察了广义相对论进动和第三颗行星质量升高至0.227MJ的影响。模拟结果表明，GJ 1148系统可能丢失了一颗巨行星。我们还进行了关于暖木星的形成机制的其他模拟。与GJ 1148的模拟结果一样，一定数量的稳定的两行星系统是通过行星被抛出而产生的，这与之前的研究结果不符，前者显示两行星系统仅仅通过行星-行星碰撞形成。 <br /><br />总结: GJ 1148系统包括两颗类土星质量的行星围绕M型矮星运动，在数值实验中发现可能丢失了一颗巨行星，通过对行星-行星碰撞和行星被抛出的模拟研究分析了系统形成的可能机制。 <div>
The GJ 1148 system has two Saturn-mass planets orbiting around an M dwarf star on hierarchical and eccentric orbits, with orbital period ratio of 13 and eccentricities of both planets of 0.375. The inner planet is in the regime of eccentric warm Jupiters. We perform numerical experiments to study the planet–planet scattering scenario for the origin of this orbital architecture. We consider a third planet of 0.1MJ (Jupiter's mass) in the initial GJ 1148 system with initial orbital separations of 3.5, 4, and 4.5 mutual Hill radii and initial semimajor axis of the innermost planet in the range of 0.10–0.50 au. The majority of scattering results in planet–planet collisions, followed by planet ejections, and planet–star close approaches. Among them, only planet ejections produce eccentric and widely separated two-planet systems, with some having similar orbital properties to the GJ 1148 system. We also examine the effects of general relativistic apsidal precession and a higher mass of 0.227MJ for the third planet. The simulation results suggest that the GJ 1148 system may have lost a giant planet. We also perform simulations of the general problem of the origin of warm Jupiters by planet–planet scattering. As in the GJ 1148 simulations, a nontrivial number of stable two-planet systems are produced by ejection, which disagrees with the result from a previous study showing that two-planet systems arise exclusively through planet–planet collisions.

<div> 高频峰值BL Lac对象 (HBLs), 能量均分, 电子能量密度, 辐射效率, 电子能量存储

总结:
能量均分和喷流能量预算在HBLs的辐射机制中很重要。该研究使用费米卫星的4LAC-DR3目录汇编了348个高频峰值BL Lac对象(HBLs)，并采用JetSet来拟合这些HBLs的光谱能量分布(SEDs)。研究结果表明，HBLs的SEDs可以很好地通过单区电子模型来重现，但无法实现能量均分，且相对论电子能量密度远大于磁场能量密度。大多数HBLs位于tcool < tdyn区域，具有较低的辐射效率，推测可能有光学薄的平流主导吸积流。此外，HBLs的喷流动能大于辐射功率，表明了存在非常低的辐射效率。最后，关系Ue > USyn ∼ UB, Le ∼ Lp > LB ∼ Lrad也被建立，表明HBLs的大部分能量存储在低能电子中。 <div>
Energy equipartition and the energy budget in the jet are important issues for the radiation mechanism of blazars. Early work predominantly concentrated on flat-spectrum radio quasars and a limited number of BL Lacertae (BL Lac) objects. In this paper, we compile 348 high-frequency peaked BL Lac objects (HBLs) based on the catalog of active galactic nuclei (4LAC-DR3) from Fermi-LAT, and employ JetSet to fit the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these HBLs in the framework of the one-zone lepton model. We aim to determine whether the energy budget is reasonable and whether energy equipartition is satisfied in HBLs. The results of the statistical analysis suggest that: (1) SEDs of HBLs can be reproduced well by using the one-zone lepton model; however, it cannot achieve energy equalization, and the relativistic electron energy density is far greater than the magnetic field energy density, Ue ≳ 100UB; (2) the majority of HBLs are located in the tcool < tdyn region (where the horizontal coordinate represents the jet power of electrons, while the ordinate indicates the ratio of the dynamic timescale to the cooling timescale), and the jet kinetic power of HBLs is greater than the jet power of radiation; there is a very low radiation efficiency, we deduce that HBLs may have optically thin advection-dominated accretion flows; (3) of HBLs is less than zero, which indicates that the jet kinetic power of HBLs is not affected by Poynting flux; (4) the relationships Ue > USyn ∼ UB, Le ∼ Lp > LB ∼ Lrad, and are established. These relations indicate that most of the energy of HBLs is stored in the population of low-energy electrons.

Modeling of time profiles of solar energetic particle (SEP) observations often considers transport along a large-scale magnetic field with a fixed path length from the source to the observer. Here, we point out that variability in the turbulent field line path length can affect the fits to SEP data and the inferred mean free path and injection profile. To explore such variability, we perform Monte Carlo simulations in representations of homogeneous 2D MHD + slab turbulence adapted to spherical geometry and trace trajectories of field lines and full particle orbits, considering proton injection from a narrow or wide angular region near the Sun, corresponding to an impulsive or gradual solar event, respectively. We analyze our simulation results in terms of field line and particle path length statistics for 1° × 1° pixels in heliolatitude and heliolongitude at 0.35 and 1 au from the Sun, for different values of the turbulence amplitude b/B0 and turbulence geometry as expressed by the slab fraction fs. Maps of the most probable path lengths of field lines and particles at each pixel exhibit systematic patterns that reflect the fluctuation amplitudes experienced by the field lines, which in turn relate to the local topology of 2D turbulence. We describe the effects of such path length variations on SEP time profiles, both in terms of path length variability at specific locations and the motion of the observer with respect to turbulence topology during the course of the observations.

<br /><br />该研究使用哈勃空间望远镜获取的紫外-光学-近红外光度数据，研究小星系NGC 4449中年轻星团的性质。他们发现这些星团的质量在102 < M⊙ < 105之间，年龄为1-20百万年，颜色消光E(B-V)范围在0-1.4之间。在选择了质量大于3000 M⊙的星团后，他们发现红外选择的星团具有中位质量约为7 × 10^3 M⊙，并在周围的气体和尘埃中保持5-6百万年。相反，从现有的紫外/光学目录中选择的发射线源具有中位质量约为3.5 × 10^4 M⊙，并在4百万年内清除了周围的环境。研究发现NGC 4449的环境压力过低，无法驱动这些差异。这些发现表明，星团的清除时间尺度与其质量有关，并且存在随机取样的效应。这种效应可能通过减少注入周围介质的能量和动量来增加这些星团的清除时间尺度；目前模型和观测还没有明确探讨过这种依赖性。未来的研究和观测，例如使用JWST，将填补这一空白。
<br /><br />总结: 该研究通过观测NGC 4449中的年轻星团，发现了星团质量对星团周围环境清除时间尺度的依赖关系，并指出了随机取样效应可能导致这一关联。这为未来的研究和观测提供了方向，以填补现有模型和观测中的空白。 <div>
We survey the young star cluster population in the dwarf galaxy NGC 4449 with the goal of investigating how stellar feedback may depend on the clusters’ properties. Using ultraviolet (UV)–optical–near-infrared photometry obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, we have recovered 99 compact sources exhibiting emission in the Paβ hydrogen recombination line. Our analysis reveals these sources possess masses of 102 < M⊙ < 105, ages of 1–20 Myr, and a color excess E(B − V) in the range 0–1.4. After selecting clusters with masses above 3000 M⊙ to mitigate stochastic sampling of the stellar initial mass function, we find that our IR-selected clusters have a median mass ∼ 7 × 103 M⊙ and remain embedded in their surrounding gas and dust for 5–6 Myr. In contrast, line-emitting sources selected from existing UV/optical catalogs have a median mass ∼ 3.5 × 104 M⊙ and have cleared their surroundings by 4 Myr. We further find that the environment in NGC 4449 has too low pressure to drive these differences. We interpret these findings as evidence that the clearing timescale from presupernova and supernova feedback is cluster mass dependent. Even in clusters with masses ∼ 7000 M⊙, stochastic sampling of the upper end of the stellar initial mass function is present, randomly decreasing the number of massive stars available to inject energy and momentum into the surrounding medium. This effect may increase the clearing timescales in these clusters by decreasing the effectiveness of both presupernova and supernova feedback; neither models nor observations have so far explored such dependence explicitly. Future studies and observations with, e.g., the JWST, will fill this gap.

<div> 高Galactic BL Lac对象，γ射线耀斑，贝叶斯块和HOP算法，耀斑对称性，功率谱密度，流量-光子指数关系

这篇文章对29个高Galactic BL Lac对象进行了14年Fermi大面积望远镜数据的短时间尺度γ射线耀斑的系统性搜索。通过贝叶斯块和HOP算法，发现了来自3个源的七个高质量的轨道时间尺度的耀斑段，以及量化了24个短时间尺度的耀斑结构。主要结果如下：（1）耀斑对称性参数A呈“U”形分布，短时间尺度的耀斑是对称的，而长时间尺度的耀斑是不对称的。快升慢降和慢升快降类型的耀斑数量相等。发现A与峰值/积分流量之间没有相关性，也没有在连续耀斑之间观察到参数演变。观察结果支持了长时间尺度的耀斑来自对称的短时间尺度亚小时耀斑的叠加情景。（2）年度至小时尺度上的PSD采用CARMA过程建模。在较低频率下，PSD遵循典型的破裂幂律形式。PSD的高频区域呈现连续的幂律形状，表明γ射线变异性源自跨越所有探测时间尺度的单一物理过程。（3）流量-光子指数分布显示“亮时更硬”或“亮时更软”的模式，但在达到一定临界流量后变得平坦，即Γ≈2。这种行为不能简单地用两分量或BL Lac序列模型解释，我们推测这可能与电子加速和冷却之间复杂的相互作用有关。

<br /><br />总结:
本研究首次对高Galactic BL Lac对象进行了长达14年的Fermi大面积望远镜数据的系统性分析，结果发现了短时间尺度的γ射线耀斑的特征及其对称性、功率谱密度的模型及流量-光子指数关系的复杂性。研究表明，长时间尺度的耀斑可能由短时间对称的亚小时耀斑叠加而成，γ射线变异性可能源自跨越所有时间尺度的单一物理过程，而流量-光子指数关系则可能与电子加速和冷却之间的复杂相互作用相关。 <div>
We present here the first systematic search of short-timescale γ-ray flares from 29 high Galactic latitude BL Lac objects over 14 yr of Fermi Large Area Telescope data. Using a combined Bayesian Blocks and HOP algorithm, we identified seven high-quality orbital timescale flare segments from three sources and quantified 24 short-timescale flare structures. We then performed a comprehensive analysis of flare symmetry, power spectral density (PSD) of variability, and flux–photon index relation. The main results are as follows. (1) The flare symmetry parameter A shows a “U-shaped” distribution. Short-timescale flares are symmetric while long-timescale flares are asymmetric. The number of fast-rise, slow-decay and slow-rise, fast-decay type flares are equal. No correlation is found between A and peak/integral flux. No parameter evolution is seen between consecutive flares, either. The observations support a scenario where longer-timescale flares originate from the superposition of short, symmetric subhour flares. (2) PSD from yearly to hourly timescales is modeled using the CARMA process. At lower frequencies, the PSD follows the typical broken power-law form. The high-frequency region of the PSD exhibits a continuous power-law shape, indicating that γ-ray variability originates from a single physical process across all probed timescales. (3) The flux–photon index distribution shows a pattern of “harder-when-brighter” or “softer-when-brighter,” but becomes flat above a certain critical flux, with Γ ≈ 2. This behavior cannot be simply explained by a two-component or blazar sequence model, and we speculate it may be related to complex interplay between electron acceleration and cooling.

总结:
本文研究了围绕着前主序M矮星的类地行星大气中水的流失情况。研究发现，由于H2O再生反应的有效性以及O2对紫外线的屏蔽作用，导致水的流失速率显著降低。这意味着目前在M矮星的宜居区内的类地行星更有可能保留地表水。该研究为我们更好地理解M矮星周围的行星的环境条件提供了重要线索。 <div>
Terrestrial planets currently in the habitable zone around M dwarfs are estimated to have been in runaway greenhouse conditions for up to ∼1 Gyr due to the long-term pre-main-sequence phase of M dwarfs. These planets likely lose a significant portion of water during the pre-main-sequence phase owing to H2O photolysis followed by hydrogen and oxygen loss to space. However, the effects of H2O reproduction reactions and UV shielding by chemical products that reduce photolysis-induced water loss have yet to be estimated. Here, we apply a 1D photochemical model to a H2O-dominated atmosphere of an Earth-like planet around a pre-main-sequence M dwarf to estimate these effects. We find that water loss is suppressed by efficient H2O reproduction reactions and by UV shielding due to O2. The water loss rate decreases by several to several hundred times compared to that in previous studies, with the assumption that the water loss rate is limited by stellar X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet flux or hydrogen diffusion through the atmosphere. Our results imply that terrestrial planets currently in the habitable zone around M dwarfs are more likely to retain surface water than previously estimated.

In this paper, we use two methods, an algorithm of the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise combined with the Gaussian mixture model, and the maximum likelihood method, to study two open clusters: IC 2488 and IC 2714 with Gaia Data Release 3 data. We compare the two methods in terms of cluster star number, isochrone fitting, cluster mass, and radius. The comparison shows that the selections of cluster stars by the two methods are consistent. The parameters obtained by the two methods are very close. But there are slight differences between the two methods for faint stars in IC 2714. The maximum likelihood method selects more faint stars outside of the main-sequence stripe. We conclude that the maximum likelihood method is more likely affected by field stars.

<title>Revisiting High-energy Polarization from Leptonic and Hadronic Blazar Scenarios</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
X-ray and MeV polarization can be powerful diagnostics for leptonic and hadronic blazar models. Previous predictions are mostly based on a one-zone framework. However, recent IXPE observations of Mrk 421 and 501 strongly favor a multizone framework. Thus, the leptonic and hadronic polarization predictions need to be revisited. Here we identify two generic radiation transfer effects, namely, double depolarization and energy stratification, that can have an impact on the leptonic and hadronic polarization. We show how they are generalized from previously known multizone effects of the primary electron synchrotron radiation. Under our generic multizone model, the leptonic polarization degree is expected to be much lower than the one-zone prediction, unlikely detectable in most cases. The hadronic polarization degree can reach a value as high as the primary electron synchrotron polarization during simultaneous multiwavelength flares, consistent with the one-zone prediction. Therefore, IXPE and future X-ray and MeV polarimeters such as eXTP, COSI, and AMEGO-X, have good chances to detect hadronic polarization during flares. However, the hadronic polarization cannot be well constrained during the quiescent state. Nonetheless, if some blazar jets possess relatively stable large-scale magnetic structures, as suggested by radio observations, a nontrivial polarization degree may show up for the hadronic model after a very long exposure time (≳1 yr).

Galaxy-cluster gravitational lenses enable the study of faint galaxies even at large lookback times, and, recently, time-delay constraints on the Hubble constant. There have been few tests, however, of lens model predictions adjacent to the critical curve (≲8″) where the magnification is greatest. In a companion paper, we use the GLAFIC lens model to constrain the Balmer L–σ relation for H ii regions in a galaxy at redshift z = 1.49 strongly lensed by the MACS J1149 galaxy cluster. Here we perform a detailed comparison between the predictions of 10 cluster lens models that employ multiple modeling assumptions with our measurements of 11 magnified, giant H ii regions. We find that that the models predict magnifications an average factor of 6.2 smaller, a ∼2σ tension, than that inferred from the H ii regions under the assumption that they follow the low-redshift L–σ relation. To evaluate the possibility that the lens model magnifications are strongly biased, we next consider the flux ratios among knots in three images of Sp1149, and find that these are consistent with model predictions. Moreover, while the mass-sheet degeneracy could in principle account for a factor of ∼6 discrepancy in magnification, the value of H0 inferred from SN Refsdal’s time delay would become implausibly small. We conclude that the lens models are not likely to be highly biased, and that instead the H ii regions in Sp1149 are substantially more luminous than the low-redshift Balmer L–σ relation predicts.

Since synchrotron polarization fluctuations are related to the fundamental properties of the magnetic field, we propose the polarization intensity variance to measure the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM) magnetization. We confirm the method’s applicability by comparing it with the polarization angle dispersion and its reliability by measuring the underlying Alfvénic Mach number of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. With the finding of the power-law relation of between polarization intensity variance and Alfvénic Mach number MA, we apply the new technique to the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey data, achieving the Alfvénic Mach number of the Galactic ISM. Our results show that the low-latitude Galactic ISM is dominated by sub-Alfénic turbulence, with MA approximately between 0.5 and 1.0.

总结:<br /><br />
本文研究了地球椭球性对地—空和空—空VLBI轨道选择的影响，发现可以通过调整轨道参数利用J2效应来增加短基线覆盖，填补(u,v)平面中的空白区域。通过简单的分析方法，得出了M87*和Sgr A*的(u,v)平面覆盖图，并展示了J2效应对短基线和长基线的影响。 <div>
Earth-based very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) has made rapid advances in imaging black holes. However, due to the limitations imposed on terrestrial VLBI by the Earth’s finite size and turbulent atmosphere, it is imperative to have a space-based component in future VLBI missions. This paper investigates the effect of the Earth’s oblateness, also known as the J2 effect, on orbiters in Earth–space and space–space VLBI. The paper provides an extensive discussion on how the J2 effect can directly impact orbit selection for black hole observations and how, through informed choices of orbital parameters, the effect can be used to a mission’s advantage, a fact that has not been addressed in previous space VLBI investigations. We provide a comprehensive study of how the orbital parameters of several current space VLBI proposals will vary specifically due to the J2 effect. For black hole accretion flow targets of interest, we demonstrate how the J2 effect leads to a modest increase in shorter-baseline coverage, filling gaps in the (u, v) plane. Subsequently, we construct a simple analytical formalism that allows isolation of the impact of the J2 effect on the (u, v) plane without requiring computationally intensive orbit propagation simulations. By directly constructing (u, v) coverage using J2-affected and J2-invariant equations of motion, we obtain distinct coverage patterns for M87* and Sgr A* that show extremely dense coverage on short baselines as well as long-term orbital stability on longer baselines.

总结: 
该研究提出了一种新的模型，可以通过使用来自AKARI–Spitzer星系外交叉档案数据集的多环芳烃（PAH）发射来光谱约束3–17 μm范围内的MIR灭尽/衰减曲线。他们采用PAH带在尘埃星爆星系内相对一致的内在比率的基本假设，首次经验地确定了MIR衰减曲线的整体形状，通过测量特定PAH波长处的差分衰减。研究结果显示，在大多数（超）亮红外星系中，PAH发射清楚地受到衰减的影响，并且随着遮挡的增加，PAH带经历差异衰减。与已有结果相比，模型推导的MIR衰减曲线偏好于相对灰色的连续吸收从3–8 μm，并且在9.7 μm处具有中等强度的硅酸盐特征，但18 μm的不透明度比典型值更高。<br /><br /> <div>
We introduce a novel model to spectroscopically constrain the mid-infrared (MIR) extinction/attenuation curve from 3–17 μm, using polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission drawn from an AKARI–Spitzer extragalactic cross-archival data set. Currently proposed MIR extinction curves vary significantly in their slopes toward the near-infrared, and the variation in the strengths and shapes of the 9.7 μm and 18 μm silicate absorption features make MIR spectral modeling and interpretation challenging, particularly for heavily obscured galaxies. By adopting the basic premise that PAH bands have relatively consistent intrinsic ratios within dusty starbursting galaxies, we can, for the first time, empirically determine the overall shape of the MIR attenuation curve by measuring the differential attenuation at specific PAH wavelengths. Our attenuation model shows PAH emission in most (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies is unambiguously subjected to attenuation, and we find strong evidence that PAH bands undergo differential attenuation as obscuration increases. Compared to preexisting results, the MIR attenuation curve derived from the model favors relatively gray continuum absorption from 3–8 μm and silicate features with intermediate strength at 9.7 μm but with stronger than typical 18 μm opacity.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了使用Gaia DR3数据发现的87条星流，其中28条是新发现。重点是利用这些星流来优化银河的质量模型。通过双幂律暗物质晕的拟合，得出了内部幂律斜率、尺度半径、密度扁平度和局部暗物质密度的数值。同时得出了恒星盘的质量、尺度长度和高度，以及所提出的银河模型的维里质量和50千秒差距内的质量。另外，作者还引入了大麦哲伦星云，对光环流进行拟合并得出了一致的质量估计。文章还提到了一些重要的发现，如ω Cen的附近尾迹、一条曾经是Sagittarius矮星系卫星的非常金属贫乏的星流，以及GD-1星流周围明显存在的热成分。 <div>
We present an atlas and follow-up spectroscopic observations of 87 thin stream-like structures detected with the STREAMFINDER algorithm in Gaia DR3, of which 28 are new discoveries. Here, we focus on using these streams to refine mass models of the Galaxy. Fits with a double-power-law halo with the outer power-law slope set to −βh = −3 yield an inner power-law slope of , a scale radius of , a halo density flattening qm,h = 0.75 ± 0.03, and a local dark matter density of ρh,⊙ = 0.0114 ± 0.0007 M⊙ pc−3. Freeing β yields , but this value is heavily influenced by our chosen virial mass limit. The stellar disks are found to have a combined mass of , with the thick disk contributing 12.4% ± 0.7% to the local stellar surface density. The scale lengths of the thin and thick disks are and , respectively, while their scale heights are and , respectively. The virial mass of the favored model is , while the mass inside of 50 kpc is MR<50 = 0.46 ± 0.03 × 1012M⊙. We introduce the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) into the derived potential models, and fit the Orphan stream therein, finding a mass for the LMC that is consistent with recent estimates. Some salient highlights include the nearby trailing arm of ω Cen, and a nearby very metal-poor stream that was once a satellite of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. Finally, we unambiguously detect a hot component around the GD-1 stream, consistent with it having been tidally preprocessed within its own dark matter subhalo.

The hour-long, gradual phase of solar flares is well observed across the electromagnetic spectrum, demonstrating many multiphase aspects, where cold condensations form within the heated post-flare system, but a complete 3D model is lacking. Using a state-of-the-art 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulation, we identify the key role played by the Lorentz force through the entire flare lifespan, and show that slow variations in the post-flare magnetic field achieve the bulk of the energy release. Synthetic images in multiple passbands closely match flare observations, and we quantify the role of conductive, radiative, and Lorentz force work contributions from flare onset to decay. This highlights how the non-force-free nature of the magnetic topology is crucial to trigger Rayleigh–Taylor dynamics, observed as waving coronal rays in extreme ultraviolet observations. Our C-class solar flare reproduces multiphase aspects such as post-flare coronal rain. In agreement with observations, we find strands of cooler plasma forming spontaneously by catastrophic cooling, leading to cool plasma draining down the post-flare loops. As there is force balance between magnetic pressure and tension and the plasma pressure in gradual-phase flare loops, this has potential for coronal seismology to decipher the magnetic field strength variation from observations.

We analyze 15 yr of eclipse timings of the polar V808 Aur. The rapid ingress/egress of the white dwarf and bright accretion region provide timings as precise as a few tenths of a second for rapid cadence photometric data. We find that between 2015 and 2018, the eclipse timings deviated from a linear ephemeris by more than 30 s. The rapid timing change is consistent with the periastron passage of a planet in an eccentric orbit about the polar. The best-fit orbital period is 11 ± 1 yr and we estimate a projected mass of Jupiter masses. We also show that the eclipse timings are correlated with the brightness of the polar with a slope of 1.1 s mag−1. This is likely due to the change in the geometry of the accretion curtains as a function of the mass transfer rate in the polar. While an eccentric planet offers an excellent explanation to the available eclipse data for V808 Aur, proposed planetary systems in other eclipsing polars have often struggled to accurately predict future eclipse timings.

该论文引入了一种新的方法，用于将传播的非线性磁流体动力学扰动精确分解为其组成的慢波、阿尔文波和快速波特征值能量，以及熵和场发散伪特征值能量。首先介绍了数学形式，演示了如何利用理想MHD特征系统构建总能量密度的时间演变分解。然后，通过将其应用于三个独立的非线性MHD模拟的输出来展示了分解方法。模拟结果分析证实了复合波场的组分波模式可以通过该方法唯一识别。慢、阿尔文和快波能量密度显示出与已知线性解和非线性特性的预期演变方式，包括模式转换等过程。同时，还指出并讨论了分解方法在数值实现中的一些潜在陷阱。我们得出结论，引入的精确非线性分解方法是理解MHD波分解性质以及分析和解释动态MHD模拟输出的强大且有前景的工具。 <div>
In this paper, we introduce a new method for exact decomposition of propagating, nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disturbances into their component eigenenergies associated with the familiar slow, Alfvén, and fast wave eigenmodes, and the entropy and field-divergence pseudoeigenmodes. First, the mathematical formalism is introduced, where it is illustrated how the ideal-MHD eigensystem can be used to construct a decomposition of the time variation of the total energy density into contributions from the eigenmodes. The decomposition method is then demonstrated by applying it to the output of three separate nonlinear MHD simulations. The analysis of the simulations confirms that the component wave modes of a composite wavefield are uniquely identified by the method. The slow, Alfvén, and fast energy densities are shown to evolve in exactly the way expected from comparison with known linear solutions and nonlinear properties, including processes such as mode conversion. Along the way, some potential pitfalls for the numerical implementation of the decomposition method are identified and discussed. We conclude that the exact, nonlinear decomposition method introduced is a powerful and promising tool for understanding the nature of the decomposition of MHD waves as well as analyzing and interpreting the output of dynamic MHD simulations.

<div> 超大质量黑洞，活动星系核，星系盘，恒星形成，热反馈<br />
总结：<br />
本文研究了AGN盘周边的引力不稳定性导致盘的碎裂和形成大约300个太阳质量的超大质量恒星，这些恒星可能有很长的寿命。另外，恒星也可以从盘外被俘获并从AGN盘的气体吸积中生长。研究推导了两种极限情况下的平衡恒星表面密度分布。对于AGN中心超大质量黑洞质量为106-108太阳质量，Eddington效率为0.1的情况，估计了总共103-105个大质量恒星的数量以及恒星合并的速率为10^-3到1每年。通过水动力学和N体模拟，初步研究了一组大质量恒星之间的相互作用，以提供更准确的恒星群体估计。 <div>
Gravitational instability in the outskirts of active galactic nuclei (AGN) disks leads to disk fragmentation and formation of ∼300 M⊙ supermassive stars with potentially long lifetimes. Alternatively, stars can be captured ex situ and grow from gas accretion in the AGN disk. However, the number density distribution throughout the disk is limited by thermal feedback as their luminosities provide the dominant heating source. We derive equilibrium stellar surface density profiles under two limiting contexts: in the case where the stellar lifetimes are prolonged, due to the recycling of hydrogen-rich disk gas, only the fraction of gas converted into heat is removed from the disk accretion flow. Alternatively, if stellar composition recycling is inefficient and stars can evolve off the main sequence, the disk accretion rate is quenched toward smaller radii resembling a classical starburst disk, albeit the effective removal rate depends not only on the stellar lifetime, but also the mass of stellar remnants. For AGNs with central supermassive black hole masses of ∼106–108M⊙ accreting at ∼0.1 Eddington efficiency, we estimate a total number of 103–105 massive stars and the rate of stellar mergers to be 10−3 to 1 yr−1. We initiate the detailed study of the interaction between a swarm of massive stars through hydro and N-body simulations to provide better prescriptions of dynamical processes in AGN disks, and to constrain more accurate estimates of the stellar population.

<div> 关键词: Enols, interstellar ice analogs, glyoxal, acetylenediol, formation mechanisms

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了Enols在形成原生糖和糖酸的关键中间体角色，同时也探讨了在星际环境中形成Enols的机制。实验利用含一氧化碳和水的星际冰模拟物，在暴露于来自银河系宇宙射线产生的次生电子的情况下，发现了乙二醛和其亚烯醇异构体乙炔二醇的形成。通过真空紫外光电离飞行时间质谱技术，检测到了气相中的乙二醛和乙炔二醇。实验结果揭示了乙二醛的形成途径是两个甲醛自由基的自由基重组，而乙炔二醇则是通过酮-烯醇-炔醇互变异构化形成。由于星际冰中一氧化碳和水的丰富，乙二醛和乙炔二醇是未来天文搜索的合适候选物质。此外，在天体物理学上检测到乙炔二醇有助于我们更深入地了解在深空中形成高能异构体（如烯醇体）的途径。 <div>
Enols—tautomers of ketones or aldehydes—are considered key intermediates in the formation of prebiotic sugars and sugar acids. Although laboratory simulation experiments suggest that enols should be ubiquitous in the interstellar medium, the underlying formation mechanisms of enols in interstellar environments are largely elusive. Here, we present the laboratory experiments on the formation of glyoxal (HCOCHO) along with its ynol tautomer acetylenediol (HOCCOH) in interstellar ice analogs composed of carbon monoxide (CO) and water (H2O) upon exposure to energetic electrons as a proxy for secondary electrons generated from Galactic cosmic rays. Utilizing tunable vacuum ultraviolet photoionization reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometry, glyoxal and acetylenediol were detected in the gas phase during temperature-programmed desorption. Our results reveal the formation pathways of glyoxal via radical–radical recombination of two formyl (HĊO) radicals, and that of acetylenediol via keto-enol-ynol tautomerization. Due to the abundance of carbon monoxide and water in interstellar ices, glyoxal and acetylenediol are suitable candidates for future astronomical searches. Furthermore, the detection of acetylenediol in astrophysically relevant ices advances our understanding for the formation pathways of high-energy tautomers such as enols in deep space.

宇宙曙光和电离再结合时期的H i 21cm全球信号是理解宇宙演化的重要线索，但由于信号与污染的比率极低以及复杂的仪器系统，其检测存在重大挑战。(1) 分析了电离层和天线波束对数据分析的影响，电离层与地球大气中的电离等离子层相互作用，导致观测信号的频谱失真，使前景减去过程复杂化。(2) 评估了三种不同的前景拟合模板，发现EDGES和SVD模板通常优于对数多项式。(3) 进一步调查了特定的波束失真模型及其对信号提取过程的影响。 <div>
The H i 21 cm global signal from the Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) offers critical insights into the evolution of our Universe. Yet, its detection presents significant challenges, due to its extremely low signal-to-contamination ratio and complex instrumental systematics. In this paper, we examine the effects of the ionosphere and antenna beam on data analysis. The ionosphere, an ionized plasma layer in the Earth’s atmosphere, refracts, absorbs, and emits radio waves in the relevant frequency range. This interaction results in additional spectral distortion of the observed signal, complicating the process of foreground subtraction. Additionally, chromatic variations in the beam can also introduce further contamination into the global spectrum measurement. Notably, the ionospheric effect, being dependent on the direction of incoming light, interacts with the instrumental beam, adding another layer of complexity. To address this, we evaluate three different fitting templates of foreground: the logarithmic polynomial, the physically motivated Experiment to Detect the Global EoR Signature (EDGES) template, and a singular value decomposition (SVD)-based template. Our findings indicate that the EDGES and SVD templates generally surpass logarithmic polynomials in performance. Recognizing the significance of beam chromaticity, we further investigate specific beam distortion models and their impacts on the signal extraction process.

总结:<br /><br />这篇论文介绍了一种新的多小孔窄带光谱方法，用于对近邻边缘朝向盘状星系的eDIG进行空间分辨光谱研究。通过对NGC 3556（M108）的试点研究，发现eDIG的垂直范围可达几千帕尔塞克，与X射线和射电图像相媲美。观察到[N ii]/Hα线比没有显著的垂直变化。通过对不同外星餐物质相之间的压力平衡的初步研究，发现磁场与X射线产生的热气体之间存在粗略的压力平衡，并可能在下层晕中对eDIG和热气体的全局运动起重要作用。在观察到的Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph的紫外辐射明亮的背景活动星系核位于离NGC 3556中心约29千帕尔塞克处，磁场压力远低于热气体和UV吸收线追踪到的等离子气体，尽管通过压力剖面的外推可能导致在这一比较中存在一些偏差。通过比较光学和CO线的位置-速度图，发现两种气体相的动力学是一致的，没有全局进流/流出的证据，最大旋转速度约为150 km/s。 <div>
The extraplanar diffuse ionized gas (eDIG) represents ionized gases traced by optical/UV lines beyond the stellar extent of galaxies. We herein introduce a novel multislit narrow-band spectroscopy method to conduct spatially resolved spectroscopy of the eDIG around a sample of nearby edge-on disk galaxies (eDIG-CHANGES). In this paper, we introduce the project design and major scientific goals, as well as a pilot study of NGC 3556 (M108). The eDIG is detected to a vertical extent of a few kiloparsecs above the disk, comparable to the X-ray and radio images. We do not see significant vertical variation of the [N ii]/Hα line ratio. A rough examination of the pressure balance between different circumgalactic medium phases indicates the magnetic field is in a rough pressure balance with the X-ray emitting hot gas and may play an important role in the global motion of both the eDIG and the hot gas in the lower halo. At the location of an Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph observed UV bright background active galactic nucleus ∼29 kpc from the center of NGC 3556, the magnetic pressure is much lower than that of the hot gas and the ionized gas traced by UV absorption lines, although the extrapolation of the pressure profiles may cause some biases in this comparison. By comparing the position–velocity diagrams of the optical and CO lines, we also find the dynamics of the two gas phases are consistent with each other, with no evidence of a global inflow/outflow and a maximum rotation velocity of ∼150 km s−1.

We measure the dependence of planet frequency on host star mass, ML, and distance from the Galactic center, RL, using a sample of planets discovered by gravitational microlensing. We compare the two-dimensional distribution of the lens-source proper motion, μrel, and the Einstein radius crossing time, tE, measured for 22 planetary events from Suzuki et al. with the distribution expected from Galactic model. Assuming that the planet-hosting probability of a star is proportional to , we calculate the likelihood distribution of (m,r). We estimate that and under the assumption that the planet-hosting probability is independent of the mass ratio. We also divide the planet sample into subsamples based on their mass ratio, q, and estimate that for q < 10−3 and for q > 10−3. Although uncertainties are still large, this result implies a possibility that, in orbits beyond the snowline, massive planets are more likely to exist around more massive stars whereas low-mass planets exist regardless of their host star mass.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We perform high-resolution simulations of forming star clusters as they merge inside giant molecular clouds (GMCs) using hydrodynamics coupled to N-body dynamics to simultaneously model both the gas and stars. We zoom in to previously run GMC simulations and resolve clusters into their stellar and gas components while including the surrounding GMC environment. We find that GMC gas is important in facilitating the growth of clusters in their embedded phase by promoting cluster mergers. Mergers induce asymmetric expansion of the stellar component of the clusters in our simulations. As well, mergers induce angular momentum in the clusters’ stellar and gas components. We find that mergers can lead to an increase in the amount of dense gas present in clusters if a background gas distribution is present. We predict that this can lead to new star formation that can change the overall distribution of cluster stars in velocity space. Our results suggest that subcluster mergers in the presence of background gas can imprint dynamical signatures that can be used to constrain cluster formation histories.

The pickup process of newly ionized hydrogen (H) from the Martian extended exosphere represents an important H+ escape channel on Mars. It is generally believed that interplanetary (IP) shocks can accelerate the pickup ions and, in turn, affect the pickup process. However, the underlying processes inherent to the acceleration are not yet fully understood. Here, we concentrate on the dynamic processes involved in acceleration arising from IP shock compression. We examine two typical IP shock events characterized by a sudden increase in the average energy of upstream H+ pickup ions across the shock. The H+ pickup ions continuously enter the field of view of Supra-Thermal And Thermal Ion Composition or Solar Wind Ion Analyzer on board the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN spacecraft in a narrow angular range. Moreover, they correspond to a similar part of their respective ring distributions in velocity space. By comparing measured and theoretical H+ pickup ion energies, we attribute the more energetic H+ pickup ions to the enhanced convection electric field acceleration caused by the shock compression. An increase in the guiding center drift speed across the shock implies a higher escape rate of the H+ pickup ions. Furthermore, the pitch-angle scattering could facilitate the escape of the higher energy H+ pickup ions from Mars. The results may shed light on the understanding of the energization and escape of planetary pickup ions in the solar system.

<title>Joint r-process Enrichment by Supernovae with a Metallicity Threshold and Neutron Star Mergers</title>

The enrichment history of r-process elements has been imprinted on the stellar abundances that change in accordance with increasing metallicity in galaxies. Close examination of the [Eu/Fe] feature caused by stars in nearby galaxies, including the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), shows its perplexity. The decreasing trend of the [Eu/Fe] feature is followed by a nearly constant value; this trend is generally attributed to an onset of the delayed Fe release from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), which is the same interpretation of the [α/Fe] feature. However, this feature appears in the LMC at [Fe/H] of approximately −0.7, which is significantly higher than that for the [α/Fe] case (≈−2). This result potentially indicates the presence of an overlooked property of the r-process site that remains unseen in the study of the Milky Way. Here, we propose that this [Eu/Fe]-knee feature is created by a fade-out of core-collapse SNe producing r-process elements; these elements along with neutron star mergers (NSMs) promote the r-process enrichment under the condition for this specific SNe such that their occurrence is limited to a low-metallicity environment. This metallicity threshold for the occurrence rate of r-process SNe at a subsolar is nearly identical to that for long gamma-ray bursts whose origin may be connected to fast-rotating massive stars. Moreover, we reason that the contribution of Eu from NSMs is crucial to maintain a high [Eu/Fe] at an early stage in dwarf galaxies by a balance with Fe from SNe Ia; both enrichments via NSMs and SNe Ia proceed with similar delay time distributions.

<title>Dependence of Lunar Pickup Ion Flux on Source Location: ARTEMIS Observations</title>

The Moon is enveloped in an exosphere, which is comprised of a variety of neutral atoms and molecules. Once exospheric neutrals are ionized by photons, protons, or electrons from the Sun, the resulting ions are accelerated by the electromagnetic fields of their surroundings and can thereby travel away from their source locations. These ions are the so-called pickup ions and are frequently observed by the two Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence, and Electrodynamics of Moon’s Interaction with the Sun (ARTEMIS) spacecraft. In this study, we identify 115 events from an 11 yr period of ARTEMIS observations, which contain a total of 11,987 samples for our statistics. By using analytical ion trajectory calculations, we trace the source location of each pickup ion observation. Most pickup ion trajectories originate near the subsolar point, consistent with the efficiency of sputtering. We find that the flux of pickup ions strongly anticorrelates with the source altitude, providing indirect evidence of decreasing exospheric ion flux with increasing altitude. We also find that the flux of pickup ions does not show a significant relationship with the crustal magnetic field intensity. This implies that a depression of sputtering efficiency or the trapping of near-surface freshly born ions by a crustal magnetic anomaly may not reduce the subsequent pickup ion flux as effectively as expected. In summary, the present paper provides a statistical view of lunar pickup ion fluxes in association with the altitude, local time, and local crustal magnetic field of their source locations.

<div> 质量分布，星团年龄，星际物质，初始质量函数，质量吸积率 <br />
总结: 本研究采用贝叶斯方法分析了猎户座星云团中的星源光谱能量分布，得出了每个源的质量、年龄、消光、距离和吸积率。质量分布显示猎户座星云团中存在质量分离现象，而年龄分布支持星云团在大约1百万年前经历了一次重要的星形成事件。针对质量大于0.1太阳质量的星源，得出的初始质量函数与Chabrier系统的初始质量函数契合良好。质量吸积率和质量吸积光度表现为破折号幂律关系，这表明在该星团中，绝大多数年轻星周盘的过量辐射可能主要由中心恒星驱动的X射线光致蒸发造成，而非外部光致蒸发。这意味着幂律关系的斜率可能在星形成过程开始时就被初始条件确定，而这些条件在最终形成不同规模星团的区域可能是相似的。 <div>
We have performed a comprehensive study of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) combining the photometric data obtained by the two Hubble Space Telescope Treasury programs that targeted this region. To consistently analyze the rich data set obtained in a wide variety of filters, we adopted a Bayesian approach to fit the spectral energy distribution of the sources, deriving mass, age, extinction, distance, and accretion for each source in the region. The three-dimensional study of mass distribution for bona fide cluster members shows that mass segregation in the ONC extends to subsolar masses, while the age distribution strongly supports the idea that star formation in the ONC is best described by a major episode of star formation that happened ∼1 Myr ago. For masses ≳0.1 M⊙, our derived empirical initial mass function (IMF) is in good agreement with a Chabrier system IMF. Both the accretion luminosity (Lacc) and mass accretion rates ( ) are best described by broken power-law relations. This suggests that for the majority of young circumstellar disks in this cluster the excess emission may be dominated by X-ray-driven photoevaporation by the central star rather than external photoevaporation. If this is the case, the slopes of the power-law relations may be largely determined by the initial conditions set at the onset of the star formation process, which may be quite similar between regions that eventually form clusters of different sizes.

总结:
使用哈勃空间望远镜进行深度光度测量，对来自GO-14734计划的10个目标进行了研究，包括6个确认的超微弱矮星系、3个超微弱矮星系候选体和一个可能的球状星团。其中6个目标是大麦哲伦星系的卫星或曾与其相互作用。通过最大似然技术确定了它们的结构参数。研究发现，与银河系的超微弱矮星系在星等-大小平面上没有系统差异。此外，将文献中的超微弱矮星系模拟属性转换为可观测空间，对比当前暗物质和重子物质模拟来探讨是否可以限制暗物质的性质。研究发现，使用冷暗物质、温暗物质和自相互作用暗物质模拟的超微弱矮星系在星等-大小平面上没有差异，但目前使用非传统暗物质模型模拟的超微弱矮星系样本相当有限。随着更多深度、广域的调查数据的出现，我们将有更多机会发现和表征这些超微弱的恒星系统和更广阔的低表面亮度宇宙。 <div>
We present deep Hubble Space Telescope photometry of 10 targets from Treasury Program GO-14734, including six confirmed ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxies, three UFD candidates, and one likely globular cluster. Six of these targets are satellites of, or have interacted with, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We determine their structural parameters using a maximum-likelihood technique. Using our newly derived half-light radius (rh) and V-band magnitude (MV) values in addition to literature values for other UFDs, we find that UFDs associated with the LMC do not show any systematic differences from Milky Way UFDs in the magnitude–size plane. Additionally, we convert simulated UFD properties from the literature into the MV–rh observational space to examine the abilities of current dark matter (DM) and baryonic simulations to reproduce observed UFDs. Some of these simulations adopt alternative DM models, thus allowing us to also explore whether the MV–rh plane could be used to constrain the nature of DM. We find no differences in the magnitude–size plane between UFDs simulated with cold, warm, and self-interacting DM, but note that the sample of UFDs simulated with alternative DM models is quite limited at present. As more deep, wide-field survey data become available, we will have further opportunities to discover and characterize these ultrafaint stellar systems and the greater low surface-brightness universe.

We analyze rest-frame ultraviolet to optical spectra of three z ≃ 7.47–7.75 galaxies whose Lyα emission lines were previously detected with Keck/MOSFIRE observations, using the JWST/NIRSpec observations from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science survey. From NIRSpec data, we confirm the systemic redshifts of these Lyα emitters, and emission-line ratio diagnostics indicate these galaxies were highly ionized and metal-poor. We investigate Lyα line properties, including the line flux, velocity offset, and spatial extent. For the one galaxy where we have both NIRSpec and MOSFIRE measurements, we find a significant offset in their flux measurements (∼1.3–5× greater in MOSFIRE) and a marginal difference in the velocity shifts. The simplest interpretation is that the Lyα emission is extended and not entirely encompassed by the NIRSpec slit. The cross-dispersion profiles in NIRSpec reveal that Lyα in one galaxy is significantly more extended than the nonresonant emission lines. We also compute the expected sizes of ionized bubbles that can be generated by the Lyα sources and discuss viable scenarios for the creation of sizable ionized bubbles (>1 physical Mpc). The source with the highest-ionization condition is possibly capable of ionizing its own bubble, while the other two do not appear to be capable of ionizing such a large region, but require additional sources of ionizing photons. Therefore, the fact that we detect Lyα from these galaxies suggests diverse scenarios for the escape of Lyα during the epoch of reionization. High-spectral-resolution spectra with JWST/NIRSpec will be extremely useful for constraining the physics of patchy reionization.

这篇论文采用混合模拟研究了贝尔不共振流失稳定性随宇宙射线参数的演变。研究发现，饱和状态下，磁场增强后的磁压与初始宇宙射线各向异性压力相当，而不是与宇宙射线能量通量相当。这些结果为在贝尔不稳定性重要的许多天体物理环境中预期的总磁场增强提供了一个预测性的依据。 

<br /><br />总结: 本文通过混合模拟研究了贝尔不稳定性的演化过程，发现在饱和状态下磁场增强后的磁压与初始宇宙射线各向异性压力相当，为未来在天体物理环境中对磁场增强提供了预测依据。 <div>
The nonresonant streaming instability (Bell instability) plays a pivotal role in the acceleration and confinement of cosmic rays (CRs), yet the exact mechanism responsible for its saturation and the magnitude of the final amplified magnetic field have not been assessed from first principles. Using a survey of hybrid simulations (with kinetic ions and fluid electrons), we study the evolution of the Bell instability as a function of the parameters of the CR population. We find that at saturation, the magnetic pressure in the amplified field is comparable with the initial CR anisotropic pressure, rather than with the CR energy flux, as previously argued. These results provide a predictive prescription for the total magnetic field amplification expected in the many astrophysical environments where the Bell instability is important.

<br /><br />通过3D广义相对论磁流体动力学仿真，研究了倾斜轨道上的黑洞与厚的AGN磁性阻尼吸积盘的相互作用。结果显示，次级黑洞会使射流产生2-4倍的非束缚质量流出率，在更大距离后融合为更连续的流出。另外，首次自洽地展示了主黑洞旋转与双黑洞轨道角动量之间的自旋轨道耦合会显著改变吸积盘和射流的方向，长时间内会产生60°-80°的进动。这一现象可能为厚AGN吸积盘持续进动提供了强有力的证据，并且表明如果在这样的系统中观察到这一效应，可能存在次级黑洞伴星。总体上，次级黑洞对盘的时间平均属性和主黑洞的吸积率影响微乎其微，与我们对扰动厚盘的估计一致。需要注意的是，在冷却的薄盘情况下，情况可能会发生显著变化。 <div>
Perturber objects interacting with supermassive black hole accretion disks are often invoked to explain observed quasiperiodic behavior in active galactic nuclei (AGN). We present global, 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of black holes on inclined orbits colliding with magnetically arrested thick AGN disks using a binary black hole spacetime with mass ratio 0.1. We do this by implementing an approximate time-dependent binary black hole metric into the GRMHD Athena++ code. The secondary enhances the unbound mass outflow rate 2–4 times above that provided by the disk in quasiperiodic outbursts, eventually merging into a more continuous outflow at larger distances. We present a simple analytic model that qualitatively agrees well with this result and can be used to extrapolate to unexplored regions of parameter space. We show self-consistently for the first time that spin–orbit coupling between the primary black hole spin and the binary orbital angular momentum causes the accretion disk and jet directions to precess significantly (by 60°–80°) on long timescales (e.g., ∼20 times the binary orbital period). Because this effect may be the only way for thick AGN disks to consistently precess, it could provide strong evidence of a secondary black hole companion if observed in such a system. Besides this new phenomenology, the time-average properties of the disk and accretion rates onto the primary are only marginally altered by the presence of the secondary, consistent with our estimate for a perturbed thick disk. This situation might drastically change in cooled thin disks.

The kinetic energy in tidal flows, when converted into heat, can affect the internal structure of a star and shift its location on a color–magnitude diagram from that of standard models. In this paper we explore the impact of injecting heat into stars with masses near the main-sequence turnoff mass (1.26 M⊙) of the open cluster M67. The heating rate is obtained from the tidal shear energy dissipation rate, which is calculated from first principles by simultaneously solving the equations that describe orbital motion and the response of a star’s layers to the gravitational, Coriolis, centrifugal, gas pressure, and viscous forces. The stellar structure models are computed with MESA. We focus on the effects of injecting heat in pulses lasting 0.01 Gyr, a time frame consistent with the synchronization timescale in binary systems. We find that the location of the tidally perturbed stars in the M67 color–magnitude diagram is shifted to significantly higher luminosities and effective temperatures than predicted by the standard model isochrone and includes locations corresponding to some of the blue straggler stars. Because tidal heating takes energy from the orbit, causing it to shrink, blue straggler stars could be merger or mass transfer progenitors, as well as products of these processes.

H2CO is a small organic molecule widely detected in protoplanetary disks. As a precursor to grain-surface formation of CH3OH, H2CO is considered an important precursor of O-bearing organic molecules that are locked in ices. Still, since gas-phase reactions can also form H2CO, there remains an open question on the channels by which organics form in disks, and how much the grain versus the gas pathways impact the overall organic reservoir. We present spectrally and spatially resolved Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of several ortho- and para-H2CO transitions toward the bright protoplanetary disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 163296. We derive column density, excitation temperature, and ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) radial profiles for H2CO, as well as disk-averaged values of NT ∼ 4 × 1012 cm−2, Tex ∼ 20 K, and OPR ∼ 2.7, respectively. We empirically determine the vertical structure of the emission, finding vertical heights of z/r ∼ 0.1. From the profiles, we find a relatively constant OPR ∼ 2.7 with radius, but still consistent with 3.0 among the uncertainties, a secondary increase of NT in the outer disk, and low Tex values that decrease with disk radius. Our resulting radial, vertical, and OPR constraints suggest an increased UV penetration beyond the dust millimeter edge, consistent with an icy origin but also with cold gas-phase chemistry. This Herbig disk contrasts previous results for the T Tauri disk, TW Hya, which had a larger contribution from cold gas-phase chemistry. More observations of other sources are needed to disentangle the dominant formation pathway of H2CO in protoplanetary disks.

Active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks are widely considered potential hosts for various high-energy transients, including gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The reactivation of GRB central engines can provide additional energy to shocks formed during the interaction of the initially ejected GRB jets with the circumburst material, commonly referred to as energy injections. In this paper, we study GRBs occurring in AGN disks within the context of energy injections. We adopt the standard external forward shock (EFS) model and consider both short- and long-duration GRB scenarios. Light curves for two types of radiation, namely, the radiation from the heated disk material (RHDM) and GRB afterglows, are computed. We find that the energy injection facilitates the EFS to break out from the photosphere of the low-density AGN disk at relativistic velocity. Moreover, the energy injection almost does not affect the RHDM but significantly enhances the peak flux of the GRB afterglows.

We propose a second-order statistic parameter ε, the relative occurrence rate between hot Jupiters (HJs) and cold Jupiters (CJs) (ε = ηHJ/ηCJ), to probe the migration of gas giants. Since the planet occurrence rate is the combined outcome of the formation and migration processes, a joint analysis of HJ and CJ frequency may shed light on the dynamical evolution of giant planet systems. We first investigate the behavior of ε as the stellar mass changes observationally. Based on the occurrence rate measurements of HJs (ηHJ) from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite survey and CJs (ηCJ) from the California Legacy Survey, we find a tentative trend (97% confidence) that ε drops when the stellar mass rises from 0.8 to 1.4 M⊙, which can be explained by different giant planet growth and disk migration timescales around different stars. We carry out planetesimal and pebble accretion simulations, both of which can reproduce the results of ηHJ, ηCJ, and ε. Our findings indicate that the classical core accretion + disk migration model can explain the observed decreasing trend of ε. We propose two ways to increase the significance of the trend and verify the anticorrelation. Future works are required to better constrain ε, especially for M dwarfs and for more massive stars.

总结:
本研究使用Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam选出大约100万个星系团和星系群成员星系，称为CAMIRA星系团，研究了活动星系核（AGN）的统计特性，重点关注AGN功率分数（fAGN）与星系团红移（zcl）以及距离星系团中心的关系。通过使用紫外-中红外波段的多波段数据和CIGALE代码与SKIRTOR AGN模型进行光谱能量分布拟合，确定了fAGN的值。研究发现，CAMIRA星系团中fAGN的值与zcl呈正相关，并且随着距离星系团中心的增加而增加。这些结果表明AGN群体的出现取决于红移和环境，并且高红移时期的星系群和星系团在AGN演化中起着重要作用。此外，研究还表明星系团合并可能会增强特别巨大星系团外围的AGN活动。我们的研究结果与CAMIRA星系团上的AGN数量分数相关的研究结果一致。 <div>
Herein, we present the statistical properties of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) for approximately 1 million member galaxies of galaxy groups and clusters with 0.1 < cluster redshift (zcl) < 1.4 selected using the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam, the so-called CAMIRA clusters. In this research, we focused on the AGN power fraction (fAGN), which is defined as the proportion of the contribution of AGNs to the total infrared (IR) luminosity, LIR (AGN)/LIR, and examined how fAGN depends on (i) zcl and (ii) the distance from the cluster center. We compiled multiwavelength data using the ultraviolet–mid-IR range. Moreover, we performed spectral energy distribution fits to determine fAGN using the CIGALE code with the SKIRTOR AGN model. We found that (i) the value of fAGN in the CAMIRA clusters is positively correlated with zcl, with the correlation slope being steeper than that for field galaxies, and (ii) fAGN exhibits a high value at the cluster outskirts. These results indicate that the emergence of the AGN population depends on the redshift and environment and that galaxy groups and clusters at high redshifts are important in AGN evolution. Additionally, we demonstrated that cluster–cluster mergers may enhance AGN activity at the outskirts of particularly massive galaxy clusters. Our findings are consistent with a related study on the CAMIRA clusters that was based on the AGN number fraction.

We present the results from a complex study of an eclipsing O-type binary (Aa+Ab) with the orbital period of PA = 3.2254367 days that forms part of a higher-order multiple system in a configuration of (A+B)+C. We derived masses of the Aa+Ab binary of M1 = 19.02 ± 0.12 and M2 = 17.50 ± 0.13 M ⊙, the radii of R1 = 7.70 ± 0.05 and R2 = 6.64 ± 0.06 R⊙, and temperatures of T1 = 34,250 ± 500 K and T2 = 33,750 ± 500 K. From the analysis of the radial velocities, we found a spectroscopic orbit of A in the outer A+B system with PA+B = 195.8 days (PA+B/PA ≈ 61). In the O − C analysis, we confirmed this orbit and found another component orbiting the A+B system with PAB+C = 2550 days (PAB+C/PA+B ≈ 13). From the total mass of the inner binary and its outer orbit, we estimated the mass of the third object, MB ≳ 10.7 M⊙. From the light travel time effect fit to the O − C data, we obtained the limit for the mass of the fourth component, MC ≳ 7.3 M⊙. These extra components contribute about 20%–30% (increasing with wavelength) to the total system light. From the comparison of model spectra with the multiband photometry, we derived a distance modulus of 18.59 ± 0.06 mag, a reddening of 0.16 ± 0.02 mag, and an RV of 3.2. This work is part of our ongoing project, which aims to calibrate the surface brightness–color relation for early-type stars.

We present new observations of the central 1 kpc of the M82 starburst obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope near-infrared camera instrument at a resolution θ ∼ 0.″05–0.″1 (∼1–2 pc). The data comprises images in three mostly continuum filters (F140M, F250M, and F360M), and filters that contain [Fe ii] (F164N), H2v = 1 → 0 (F212N), and the 3.3 μm polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) feature (F335M). We find prominent plumes of PAH emission extending outward from the central starburst region, together with a network of complex filamentary substructures and edge-brightened bubble-like features. The structure of the PAH emission closely resembles that of the ionized gas, as revealed in Paschen α and free–free radio emission. We discuss the origin of the structure, and suggest the PAHs are embedded in a combination of neutral, molecular, and photoionized gas.

Entering the era of large-scale galaxy surveys, which will deliver unprecedented amounts of photometric and spectroscopic data, there is a growing need for more efficient, data-driven, and less model-dependent techniques to analyze the spectral energy distribution of galaxies. In this work, we demonstrate that by taking advantage of manifold learning approaches, we can estimate spectroscopic features of large samples of galaxies from their broadband photometry when spectroscopy is available only for a fraction of the sample. This will be done by applying the self-organizing map algorithm on broadband colors of galaxies and mapping partially available spectroscopic information into the trained maps. In this pilot study, we focus on estimating the 4000 Å break in a magnitude-limited sample of galaxies in the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field. We also examine this method to predict the HδA index given our available spectroscopic measurements. We use observed galaxy colors (u,g,r,i,z,Y,J,H), as well as spectroscopic measurements for a fraction of the sample from the LEGA-C and zCOSMOS spectroscopic surveys to estimate this feature for our parent photometric sample. We recover the D4000 feature for galaxies that only have broadband colors with uncertainties about twice the uncertainty of the employed spectroscopic surveys. Using these measurements, we observe a positive correlation between D4000 and the stellar mass of the galaxies in our sample with weaker D4000 features for higher-redshift galaxies at fixed stellar masses. These can be explained by the downsizing scenario for the formation of galaxies and the decrease in their specific star formation rate as well as the aging of their stellar populations over this time period.

<div> 关键词: 瞬时区域，磁通量出现，辅助磁通量出现，磁轴，Ω环

总结:<br /><br />这项研究对太阳瞬时区域（ER）中辅助磁通量出现（SFEs）的复杂模式进行了详细研究。通过对Solar Dynamics Observatory的观测，研究了5个ER的磁通量最大值约为1020 Mx，其中每个ER都有数十个SFEs，平均新出现的磁通量约为5×1018 Mx。SFEs的磁通量频率符合幂律分布，大多数出现在ER的正负极性之间，并且生长时间集中在1小时内。研究发现SFE的磁轴呈随机分布。提出了SFEs与ERs之间的关系，认为SFEs可能是ERs磁通管束的一部分，并且SFEs部分是出现的Ω环。 <div>
As a relatively active region, the ephemeral region (ER) exhibits a highly complex pattern of magnetic flux emergence. We aim to study in detail the secondary flux emergences (SFEs), which we define as bipoles that appear close to ERs and finally coalesce with ERs after a period of time. We study SFEs during the whole process, from the emergence to the decay of five ERs observed by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The maximum unsigned magnetic flux for each ER is around 1020 Mx. Each ER has tens of SFEs with an average emerging magnetic flux of approximately 5 × 1018 Mx. The frequency of normalized magnetic flux for all the SFEs follows a power-law distribution with an index of −2.08. The majority of SFEs occur between the positive and negative polarities of an ER, and their growth time is concentrated within 1 hr. The magnetic axis of SFE is found to exhibit a random distribution in the five ERs. We suggest that the relationship between SFEs and ERs can be understood by regarding the photospheric magnetic field observations as cross sections of an emerging magnetic structure. Tracking the evolution of ERs, we propose that these SFEs in ERs may have emerged consequentially from the bundle of flux tubes of ERs and that SFEs are partially emerged Ω-loops.

总结:<br />
研究发现，帕克太阳探测器观测到的太阳风间隙表现出低密度、极低速度、低质子温度和基本无磁场偏转的特性，近音速间隙主要是由于速度极低，而不是声速。利用等离子体模型追踪发现，这些近音速间隙都与日冕空洞内部的边界相连。在近音速间隙附近观测到的赫利欧圈局部电流片和赫利欧圈电流片交叉，表明近音速太阳风是慢风和快风之间的过渡层。磁场波动的幅度与径向声速马赫数存在相关性。磁场偏转在近音速临界点附近基本消失，这表明磁场波动起源于声速临界点以上。 <div>
We identify and examine the solar wind intervals near the sonic critical point (i.e., MS ∼ 1) observed by the Parker Solar Probe. The near-subsonic wind intervals show similar properties: a low density, an extremely low velocity, a low proton temperature, and essentially no magnetic field deflections compared with the surrounding solar wind. The extremely low velocity is the primary contributor to the near crossing of the sonic critical point rather than the sound speed, which is roughly constant in these intervals. Source tracing with a potential-field source-surface model suggests that the near subsonic intervals all connect to the boundaries inside coronal holes. Heliospheric current sheet (HCS) and partial HCS crossings around the near subsonic intervals indicate that the near subsonic wind is a transition layer between the slow and fast winds. The above scenario is consistent with the nature of the near-subsonic wind as a low-Mach-number boundary layer, which facilitates the crossing of the sonic critical point at 15–20 RS. Moreover, we find a dependence of the amplitude of switchbacks on the radial sonic Mach number. Magnetic field deflections essentially disappear near the sonic critical point, which suggests that switchbacks originate from above the sonic critical point.

Gravitational-wave detectors are unveiling a population of binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to redshifts z ≈ 1, and are starting to constrain how the BBH population evolves with redshift. We present predictions for the redshift evolution of the BBH mass and spin distributions for systems originating from dense star clusters. Utilizing a grid of 144 state-of-the-art dynamical models for globular clusters, we demonstrate that BBH merger rates peak at higher redshifts for larger black hole primary masses M1. Specifically, for M1 ≳ 40 M⊙, the BBH merger rate reaches its peak at redshift z ≈ 2.1, while for M1 ≲ 20 M⊙, the peak occurs at z ≈ 1.1, assuming that the cluster formation rate peaks at z = 2.2. The average BBH primary mass also increases from ∼10 M⊙ at z = 0 to ∼30 M⊙ at z = 10. We show that ∼20% BBHs contain massive remnants from next-generation mergers, with this fraction increasing (decreasing) for larger (smaller) primary masses. This difference is not large enough to significantly alter the effective spins of the BBH population originating from globular clusters, and we find that their effective spin distribution does not evolve across cosmic time. These findings can be used to distinguish BBHs from dense star clusters by future gravitational-wave observations.

The abundance of faint dwarf galaxies is determined by the underlying population of low-mass dark matter (DM) halos and the efficiency of galaxy formation in these systems. Here, we quantify potential galaxy formation and DM constraints from future dwarf satellite galaxy surveys. We generate satellite populations using a suite of Milky Way (MW)–mass cosmological zoom-in simulations and an empirical galaxy–halo connection model, and assess sensitivity to galaxy formation and DM signals when marginalizing over galaxy–halo connection uncertainties. We find that a survey of all satellites around one MW-mass host can constrain a galaxy formation cutoff at peak virial masses of at the 1σ level; however, a tail toward low prevents a 2σ measurement. In this scenario, combining hosts with differing bright satellite abundances significantly reduces uncertainties on at the 1σ level, but the 2σ tail toward low persists. We project that observations of one (two) complete satellite populations can constrain warm DM models with mWDM ≈ 10 keV (20 keV). Subhalo mass function (SHMF) suppression can be constrained to ≈70%, 60%, and 50% that in cold dark matter (CDM) at peak virial masses of 108, 109, and 1010M⊙, respectively; SHMF enhancement constraints are weaker (≈20, 4, and 2 times that in CDM, respectively) due to galaxy–halo connection degeneracies. These results motivate searches for faint dwarf galaxies beyond the MW and indicate that ongoing missions like Euclid and upcoming facilities including the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will probe new galaxy formation and DM physics.

The latitudinal structure of the solar wind varies during the cycle of solar activity. Analysis of this variation is important for understanding the solar activity and interpretation of observations of heliospheric energetic neutral hydrogen atoms and interstellar neutral (ISN) atoms inside the heliosphere, which yield information on the heliosphere and its interaction with the interstellar medium. Existing methods of retrieving this information from indirect remote-sensing measurements of phenomena, including the heliospheric backscatter glow and interplanetary scintillations of remote radio sources, are challenging to apply in real time. Here, we propose a method WawHelioIonMP of approximate retrieval of latitudinal profiles of the ionization rates of ISN H using a machine-learning-based interpretation of the helioglow. Assuming that we know their history during two past solar cycles and have observations of the helioglow for close-to-circumsolar circles with a radius close to 90°, we derive statistically an algebraic relation between the ionization profiles and lightcurves. With the relation reversed, we are then able to derive the ionization rate profiles based on observed light curves, such as those planned for the GLObal solar Wind Structure (GLOWS) experiment on the forthcoming NASA mission Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP). The application of this method is straightforward and rapid because complex simulations are no longer needed. We present the method of retrieval of the profiles of the ionization rates, leaving the discussion of details of the decomposition of the retrieved ionization rate profiles into profiles of the solar wind speed and density to a future paper.

Filamentary structures are ubiquitously found in high-mass star-forming clouds. To investigate the relationship between filaments and star formation, we carry out the INFANT (Investigations of Massive Filaments and Sar Formation) survey, a multiscale, multiwavelength survey of massive filamentary clouds with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) band 3/band 6 and Very Large Array K band. In this first paper, we present the ALMA band 6 continuum observations toward a sample of eight high-mass star-forming filaments. We covered each target with an approximately rectangular mosaic field of view with two 12 m array configurations, achieving an angular resolution of ∼0.″6 (2700 au at 4.5 kpc) and a continuum rms of ∼0.1 mJy beam−1 (∼0.06 M⊙ in gas mass assuming 15 K). We identify cores using the getsf and astrodendro and find the former is more robust in terms of both identification and measuring flux densities. We identify in total 183 dense cores (15–36 cores in each cloud) and classify their star formation states via outflow and warm gas tracers. The protostellar cores are statistically more massive than the prestellar cores, possibly indicating further accretion onto cores after the formation of protostars. For the high-mass end ( > 1.5 M⊙) of the core mass function (CMF) we derive a power-law index of −1.15 ± 0.12 for the whole sample and −1.70 ± 0.25 for the prestellar population. We also find a steepening trend in CMF with cloud evolution (−0.89 ± 0.15 for the young group versus. −1.44 ± 0.25 for the evolved group) and discuss its implications for cluster formation.

<div> 光谱，超新星，近红外，数据分析，模型参数<br />
总结:<br />
这篇文章介绍了一种利用光学光谱对Ia型超新星（SNe Ia）在近红外（NIR）波长范围内的光谱行为进行外推的方法。通过对卡内基超新星项目I＆II光学和NIR FIRE光谱数据进行主成分分析，可以产生能够进行这种外推的模型。这种方法不同于先前的光谱模板方法，不仅仅通过SNe Ia的光变曲线属性来参数化模型，从而更灵活地产生外推的NIR flux。研究发现，在大多数测试案例中（包括Branch核心正常和浅硅亚型），这些外推和观测之间的总集成NIR flux差异约为-3.1％至-2.7％。然而，对于其他测试发现与观测的较大偏差，这可能是由于训练样本中高速和宽线SNe Ia有限。最大光度主分量能够对色伸展光变曲线参数sBV进行光谱预测，与光度测量的值大致相符。此外，结果表明这些外推结果与NIR模板比较良好，尽管在大多数情况下模板略微更适合观测，这显示了需要更多同时进行光学+NIR光谱观测，以真正了解NIR中SNe Ia的多样性。 <div>
We present a method of extrapolating the spectroscopic behavior of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength regime up to 2.30 μm using optical spectroscopy. Such a process is useful for accurately estimating K-corrections and other photometric quantities of SNe Ia in the NIR. A principal component analysis is performed on data consisting of Carnegie Supernova Project I & II optical and NIR FIRE spectra to produce models capable of making these extrapolations. This method differs from previous spectral template methods by not parameterizing models strictly by photometric light-curve properties of SNe Ia, allowing for more flexibility of the resulting extrapolated NIR flux. A difference of around −3.1% to −2.7% in the total integrated NIR flux between these extrapolations and the observations is seen here for most test cases including Branch core-normal and shallow-silicon subtypes. However, larger deviations from the observation are found for other tests, likely due to the limited high-velocity and broad-line SNe Ia in the training sample. Maximum-light principal components are shown to allow for spectroscopic predictions of the color-stretch light-curve parameter, sBV, within approximately ±0.1 units of the value measured with photometry. We also show these results compare well with NIR templates, although in most cases the templates are marginally more fitting to observations, illustrating a need for more concurrent optical+NIR spectroscopic observations to truly understand the diversity of SNe Ia in the NIR.

<div> Hubble Tension, El Gordo’s collision, impossible galaxies, standard model, general relativity
<br />
现代宇宙学面临重要挑战，如哈勃张力、 El Gordo的碰撞，或者不可能的星系（z > 10）。标准模型的轻微修改提出了新的参数（例如早期和动力暗能量）。另一方面，替代方案，比如沿海宇宙（例如超锥模型和空间平坦Rh = ct宇宙），在统计意义上与大多数观测测试相容，但在匹配观测到的物质含量方面仍存在理论问题，因为它们预测“零主动引力质量”。为了解决这些悬而未决的问题，我们建议广义相对论在宇宙尺度上可能无效，但在局部尺度上是有效的。这一提议是从超锥模型的两个主要特征中解决的：（1）背景度规与物质内容无关，（2）观测到的宇宙加速度是虚假的，是由于坐标的扭曲立体投影产生的从均匀流形到表观径向不均匀。最后，为了支持讨论，标准观测测试在这里得到了更新，显示超锥模型完全适用于Ia型超新星、类星体、星系团、重子声学振荡和宇宙测时器数据集。
<br /><br />总结: 现代宇宙学面临了许多重要挑战，包括哈勃张力、El Gordo的碰撞和不可能的星系。标准模型的一些轻微修改提出了新的参数，而替代方案在统计上与观测测试相容，但在理论上仍存在问题。为了解决这些问题，文章建议在宇宙尺度上广义相对论可能无效，但在局部尺度上是有效的。文章提出的超锥模型通过更新的观测测试表明适用于多种数据集，包括Ia型超新星、类星体、星系团、重子声学振荡和宇宙测时器。 <div>
Modern cosmology presents important challenges such as the Hubble Tension, El Gordo’s collision, or the impossible galaxies (z > 10). Slight modifications to the standard model propose new parameters (e.g., the early and dynamical dark energy). On the other hand, alternatives such as the coasting universes (e.g., the hyperconical model and the spatially flat Rh = ct universe) are statistically compatible with most of the observational tests, but still present theoretical problems in matching the observed matter contents since they predict a “zero active gravitational mass.” To solve these open issues, we suggest that general relativity might be not valid at cosmic scales, but it would be valid at local scales. This proposal is addressed from two main features of the embedding hyperconical model: (1) the background metric would be independent of the matter content, and (2) the observed cosmic acceleration would be fictitious and because of a distorted stereographic projection of coordinates that produce an apparent radial inhomogeneity from homogeneous manifolds. Finally, to support the discussion, standard observational tests were updated here, showing that the hyperconical model is adequately fitted to Type Ia supernovae, quasars, galaxy clusters, baryon acoustic oscillations, and cosmic chronometer data sets.

<title>Properties of the Line-of-sight Velocity Field in the Hot and X-Ray-emitting Circumgalactic Medium of Nearby Simulated Disk Galaxies</title>

<div> 热环绕星系介质，X射线，TNG50模拟，观测，气体动力学 <br />
总结:<br />
这篇文章研究了 Milky Way 大小的盘状星系的热环绕星系介质的气体动力学。通过合成观测，发现热相通常表现为从盘状星系中的反馈过程驱动的流出、近银河平面的径向流入和旋转。而在一些系统中，速度场更加无序和湍流。文章指出，具有约1电子伏的光谱分辨率可以测量快速且炽热的流出（约200-500千米/秒），旋转速度可以通过边缘星系的线偏移来测量（约100-200千米/秒），而缓慢的流入（约50-100千米/秒）则较难在投影中测量，但可以通过多组分光谱拟合来检测。文章还强调了对测量速度的敏感性取决于使用的发射线，指出测量这些流动将限制这些星系中气体演化的理论。 <div>
The hot, X-ray-emitting phase of the circumgalactic medium of massive galaxies is believed to be the reservoir of baryons from which gas flows onto the central galaxy and into which feedback from active galactic nuclei and stars inject mass, momentum, energy, and metals. These effects shape the velocity fields of the hot gas, which can be observed via the Doppler shifting and broadening of emission lines by X-ray integral field units. In this work, we analyze the gas kinematics of the hot circumgalactic medium of Milky Way–mass disk galaxies from the TNG50 simulation with synthetic observations to determine how future instruments can probe this velocity structure. We find that the hot phase is often characterized by outflows from the disk driven by feedback processes, radial inflows near the galactic plane, and rotation, although in some systems the velocity field is more disorganized and turbulent. With a spectral resolution of ∼1 eV, fast and hot outflows (∼200–500 km s−1) can be measured, depending on the orientation of the galaxy on the sky. The rotation velocity of the hot phase (∼100–200 km s−1) can be measured using line shifts in edge-on galaxies, and is slower than that of colder gas phases but similar to stellar rotation velocities. By contrast, the slow inflows (∼50–100 km s−1) are difficult to measure in projection with these other components, but may be detected in multicomponent spectral fits. We find that the velocity measured is sensitive to which emission lines are used. Measuring these flows will constrain theories of how the gas in these galaxies evolves.

<div> IceCube, neutrino flares, data set, upper limits, diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux
总结:
IceCube在2011年至2021年5月收集了数据，用于搜索天空中的中微子闪耀现象。数据集包含源自带电电子中微子和τ中微子相互作用以及全味道中微子中性电流相互作用的级联样式事件。这些数据与以前的全部天空搜索中使用的轨迹样式事件数据集在统计上是独立的。虽然角分辨率较低，但由于低背景特性，级联数据集具有竞争力，并且与之前的搜索方法相辅相成。在进行全天扫描时没有观察到明显的中微子发射闪耀现象。针对不同持续时间的中微子闪耀制定了上限。此外，还提出了关于这些闪耀对漫射天体中微子流的贡献的限制，表明多个未解决的瞬变源可能会对漫射天体中微子流做出贡献。 <div>
Neutrino flares in the sky are searched for in data collected by IceCube between 2011 and 2021 May. This data set contains cascade-like events originating from charged-current electron neutrino and tau neutrino interactions and all-flavor neutral-current interactions. IceCube’s previous all-sky searches for neutrino flares used data sets consisting of track-like events originating from charged-current muon neutrino interactions. The cascade data set is statistically independent of the track data sets, and while inferior in angular resolution, the low-background nature makes it competitive and complementary to previous searches. No statistically significant flare of neutrino emission was observed in an all-sky scan. Upper limits are calculated on neutrino flares of varying duration from 1 hr to 100 days. Furthermore, constraints on the contribution of these flares to the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux are presented, showing that multiple unresolved transient sources may contribute to the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux.

<br />
这篇文章通过对泛神论+目录中的一组Ia型超新星的Hubble-Lemaître图进行方向分析，揭示了Hubble常数H0的角向依赖性。研究显示，在本地宇宙（0.015 ≤ z ≤ 0.06）中，物质结构呈现出一个统计显著的偶极变化，其运动趋向于（l, b）=（326.°1 ± 11.°2, 27.°8 ± 11.°2），速度为132.14 ± 109.3 km s−1，这个方向接近于Shapley超星团（lShapley，bShapley）=（311.°5, 32.°3）。与之相反的偶极方向指向着Dipole Repeller结构。研究结果证实了引力偶极系统Shapley-Dipole Repeller很好地解释了本地宇宙中观测到的物质结构的流速场。此外，研究还提供了Hubble常数H0的测量结果为70.39 ± 1.4 km s−1 Mpc−1 ，在有效距离102.8 Mpc，z≃0.025。
<br /><br />总结: Hubble-Lemaître图用于研究本地宇宙的物质结构运动；研究发现H0存在显著的角向变化，指向Shapley超星团，速度为132.14 km s−1；结果支持引力偶极系统Shapley-Dipole Repeller很好地解释了物质结构的流速场；得到了H0的测量结果为70.39 km s−1 Mpc−1，在有效距离102.8 Mpc。 <div>
The bulk flow in the Local Universe is a collective phenomenon due to the peculiar motions of matter structures, which, instead of moving in random directions, appears to follow an approximate dipole velocity flow. We apply a directional analysis to investigate, through the Hubble-Lemaître diagram, the angular dependence of the Hubble constant H0 of a sample of Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon+ catalog in the Local Universe (0.015 ≤ z ≤ 0.06). We perform a directional analysis that reveals a statistically significant dipole variation of H0, at more than 99.9% confidence level, showing that matter structures follow a dipole bulk flow motion toward (l, b) = (326.°1 ± 11.°2, 27.°8 ± 11.°2), close to the Shapley supercluster (lShapley, bShapley) = (311.°5, 32.°3), with velocity 132.14 ± 109.3 km s−1 at the effective distance 102.83 ± 10.2 Mpc. Interestingly, the antipodal direction of this dipole points close to the Dipole Repeller structure. Our analyses confirm that the gravitational dipole system Shapley-Dipole Repeller explains well the observed bulk flow velocity field in the Local Universe. Furthermore, we performed robustness tests that support our results. Additionally, our approach provides a measurement of the Hubble constant H0 = 70.39 ± 1.4 km s−1 Mpc−1, at the effective distance 102.8 Mpc, z ≃ 0.025.

<div> 关键词: 惯性波, 太阳表面, 太阳内部, 辐射模式耦合, 震动观测<br />
<br />总结:
太阳表面观测到的惯性波可能延伸到太阳更深层。研究利用了地震观测技术，探索了这些运动，以分辨径向和纬向定态模式。利用空间观测资料分析了2010年至2017年间的8年数据，通过辐射模式耦合测量了声学模式之间和不同频率间的耦合，以捕捉惯性模式的不同长度尺度。研究发现在高纬度存在频率约为-80nHz、方位角t=1的惯性模式，存在于整个对流区。罗斯贝模式的存在可能一直延伸到约0.83R⊙的深度，而对于高方位角的罗斯贝信号在该深度以下很难与噪音区分开。还发现这些模式的振幅随深度增加而下降，同时我们发现罗斯贝模式的纬向本征函数与扇形球谐函数有所不同，需要小心解释这些特性。这些深度相关特征的研究有助于在分离p模式地震学之外捕捉内部动态。 <div>
Recently discovered inertial waves, observed on the solar surface, likely extend to the deeper layers of the Sun. Utilizing helioseismic techniques, we explore these motions, allowing us to discern inertial mode eigenfunctions in both radial and latitudinal orientations. We analyze 8 yr of space-based observations (2010–2017) taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory using normal mode coupling. Couplings between the same and different-degree acoustic modes and different frequency bins are measured in order to capture the various length scales of the inertial modes. We detect inertial modes at high latitude with azimuthal order t = 1 and frequency ∼ −80 nHz, measured in a corotating frame with a rotation frequency of 453.1 nHz. This mode is present in the entire convection zone. The presence of Rossby modes may be seen down to a depth of ∼0.83R⊙, and the Rossby signal is indistinguishable from noise below that depth for high azimuthal order. We find that the amplitudes of these modes increase with depth down to around 0.92R⊙ and decrease below that depth. We find that the latitudinal eigenfunctions of Rossby modes deviate from sectoral spherical harmonics if we use a similar approach as adopted in earlier studies. We find that spatial leakage and even pure noise in the measurements of nonsectoral components can also explain the abovementioned characteristics of the latitudinal eigenfunctions. This realization underscores the necessity for careful interpretation when considering the latitudinal eigenfunctions of Rossby modes. Exploring the depth-dependent characteristics of these modes will enable us to capture interior dynamics distinctly, separate from p-mode seismology.

<br />总结:<br />最近的大面积射电连续波调查发现了一类新的源，即所谓的奇异射电圈（ORC）。研究人员进行了对这些源中心或潜在相关的六个星系的宝石光学光谱学研究，并进行了Legacy Survey成像和Prospector拟合。结果显示，具有中心星系的三个ORC的距离在0.27至0.55之间，证实了射电圈的大固有直径（300-500 kpc）。这些中心星系都是质量较大、红色、无遮挡的椭圆星系，具有古老的恒星群。它们具有LINER光谱类型，受冲击或活动星系核（AGN）的能量驱动。所有三个中心星系都有低辐射、无尘埃的AGN。中央星系的相似性表明它们可能有共同的起源，也许是来自古老星暴的冲击波。另外两个ORC相邻且没有明显中心星系，但它们中间的z=0.25的盘状星系却 藏有2型、中等亮度的AGN。因此可能是这些AGN的射电喷流。 <div>
A new class of sources, the so-called odd radio circles (ORCs), have been discovered by recent sensitive, large-area radio continuum surveys. The distances of these sources have so far relied on photometric redshifts of optical galaxies found at the centers of or near ORCs. Here we present Gemini rest-frame optical spectroscopy of six galaxies at the centers of, or potentially associated with, the first five ORC discoveries. We supplement this with Legacy Survey imaging and Prospector fits to their griz+W1/W2 photometry. Of the three ORCs with central galaxies, all lie at distances (z = 0.27–0.55) that confirm the large intrinsic diameters of the radio circles (300–500 kpc). The central galaxies are massive (M* ∼ 1011M☉), red, unobscured ellipticals with old (≳1 Gyr) stellar populations. They have LINER spectral types that are shock-powered or active galactic nucleus (AGN)-powered. All three host low-luminosity, radio-quiet AGN. The similarity of their central galaxies is consistent with a common origin, perhaps as a blast wave from an ancient starburst. The other two ORCs are adjacent and have no prominent central galaxies. However, the z = 0.25 disk galaxy that lies between them hosts a Type 2, moderate-luminosity AGN. They may instead be the lobes of a radio jet from this AGN.

总结:
T-Tauri星，年轻的原主序星，由于存在大规模的星斑而使年龄和质量的确定变得困难。文章通过近红外光谱调查了Taurus-Auriga中10颗T-Tauri星，对它们的星斑填充因子和温度进行了表征，分析了这对温度和亮度测定的影响，以及对推断的恒星质量和年龄的后果。研究利用马尔科夫链蒙特卡洛算法构建了带有星斑的恒星的组合模型，并利用这一方法还原了目标的光谱和分子特征强度。通过多周期观测的星，还对光谱变化和填充因子随K2和AAVSO光度测定的旋转周期进行了相关性分析。结合星斑校正的有效温度和Gaia距离，计算了光度并利用星斑模型推断了样本恒星的星斑校正质量和年龄。这种星斑校正方法使得质量平均增加了60%，年龄增加了一倍，相比于传统方法使用不考虑星斑影响的光谱测定。 <div>
Accurate age and mass determinations for young pre-main-sequence stars are made challenging by the presence of large-scale starspots. We present results from a near-infrared spectroscopic survey of 10 T-Tauri Stars in Taurus-Auriga that characterize spot-filling factors and temperatures, the resulting effects on temperature and luminosity determinations, and the consequences for inferred stellar masses and ages. We constructed composite models of spotted stars by combining BTSettl-CIFIST synthetic spectra of atmospheres to represent the spots and the photosphere along with continuum emission from a warm inner disk. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, we find the best-fit spot and photospheric temperatures, spot-filling factors, as well as disk-filling factors. This methodology allowed us to reproduce the 0.75–2.40 μm stellar spectra and molecular feature strengths for all of our targets, disentangling the complicated multicomponent emission. For a subset of stars with multiepoch observations spanning an entire stellar rotation, we correlate the spectral variability and changes in the filling factors with rotational periods observed in K2 and AAVSO photometry. Combining spot-corrected effective temperatures and Gaia distances, we calculate luminosities and use the Stellar Parameters of Tracks with Starspots models to infer spot-corrected masses and ages for our sample of stars. Our method of accounting for spots results in an average increase of 60% in mass and a doubling in age with respect to traditional methods using optical spectra that do not account for the effect of spots.

We search for mass segregation in the intermediate-aged open cluster NGC 6819 within a carefully identified sample of probable cluster members. Using photometry from Gaia, Pan-STARRS, and the Two Micron All Sky Survey as inputs for a Bayesian statistics software suite, BASE-9, we identify a rich population of (photometric) binaries and derive posterior distributions for the cluster age, distance, metallicity, and reddening, as well as star-by-star photometric membership probabilities, masses, and mass ratios (for binaries). Within our entire sample, we identify 2632 cluster members and 777 binaries. We then select a main-sequence “primary sample” with 14.85 < 19.5, containing 1342 cluster members and 250 binaries with mass ratios q > 0.5, to investigate mass segregation. Within this primary sample, we find the binary radial distribution is significantly shifted toward the cluster center as compared to the single stars, resulting in a binary fraction that increases significantly toward the cluster core. Furthermore, we find that within the binary sample, more massive binaries have more centrally concentrated radial distributions than less massive binaries. The same is true for the single stars. We verify the expectation of mass segregation for this stellar sample in NGC 6819 through both relaxation time arguments and by investigating a sophisticated N-body model of the cluster. Importantly, this is the first study to investigate mass segregation of the binaries in the open cluster NGC 6819.

We apply for the first time orbit-averaged Monte Carlo star cluster simulations to study tidal tail and stellar stream formation from globular clusters (GCs), assuming a circular orbit in a time-dependent spherical Galactic potential. Treating energetically unbound bodies—potential escapers (PEs)—as collisionless enables this fast but spherically symmetric method to capture asymmetric extratidal phenomena with exquisite detail. Reproducing stream features such as epicyclic overdensities, we show how returning tidal tails can form after the stream fully circumnavigates the Galaxy, enhancing the stream's velocity dispersion by several kilometers per second in our ideal case. While a truly clumpy, asymmetric, and evolving Galactic potential would greatly diffuse such tails, they warrant scrutiny as potentially excellent constraints on the Galaxy’s history and substructure. Reexamining the escape timescale Δt of PEs, we find new behavior related to chaotic scattering in the three-body problem; the Δt distribution features sharp plateaus corresponding to distinct locally smooth patches of the chaotic saddle separating the phase-space basins of escape. We study for the first time Δt in an evolving cluster, finding that for PEs with (low, high) Jacobi energy EJ, flatter than for a static cluster ( ). Accounting for cluster mass loss and internal evolution lowers the median Δt from ∼10 Gyr to ≲100 Myr. We finally outline potential improvements to escape in the Monte Carlo method intended to enable the first large grids of tidal tail/stellar stream models from full GC simulations and detailed comparison to stream observations.

<br />Gaia望远镜在2023年3月6日发现了Gaia23bab的2等级爆发，这是银河平面上一个年轻的恒星物体。研究人员通过大型双望远镜对Gaia23bab进行了观测，并收集了所有公开的多波段光度数据，重建了历史光变曲线。曲线显示在过去10年内（2013年、2017年和2023年）有三次爆发，持续时间和振幅都符合EXor变星的特征。研究估计，由于这些爆发，该恒星上积累的质量大约是如果源泉保持平静相同时间的两倍。光度分析显示Gaia23bab是一个II类源，年龄≲1百万年，光谱类型为G3-K0，恒星光度约为4.0太阳光度，质量约为1.6太阳质量。光学/近红外光谱富含发射线。通过这些线的分析，研究人员测量了一个与EXors一致的吸积光度和质量吸积率（Laccburst约为3.7太阳光度，burst约为2.0×10^-7太阳质量每年）。总的来说，研究人员在一组EXors中推导出了吸积和恒星参数之间的关系。他们发现，当处于爆发状态时，吸积参数几乎不依赖于恒星参数，并且即使在平静时，EXors在积累质量方面也比经典的T Tauri恒星更有效。 <br /><br />总结: 本文介绍了Gaia23bab这颗年轻恒星物体的观测与分析结果。研究发现，它在过去10年内有三次爆发，吸积参数与恒星参数关系的变化特点。研究为我们更好地了解这类恒星提供了重要参考。 <div>
On 2023 March 6, the Gaia telescope alerted a 2 mag burst from Gaia23bab, a young stellar object in the Galactic plane. We observed Gaia23bab with the Large Binocular Telescope obtaining optical and near-infrared spectra close in time to the peak of the burst, and collected all public multiband photometry to reconstruct the historical light curve. The latter shows three bursts in 10 years (2013, 2017, and 2023), whose duration and amplitude are typical of EXor variables. We estimate that, due to the bursts, the mass accumulated on the star is about twice greater than if the source had remained quiescent for the same period of time. Photometric analysis indicates that Gaia23bab is a class II source with age ≲1 Myr, spectral type G3−K0, stellar luminosity ∼4.0 L⊙, and mass ∼1.6 M⊙. The optical/near-infrared spectrum is rich in emission lines. From the analysis of these lines we measured an accretion luminosity and mass accretion rate (Laccburst ∼ 3.7 L⊙, burst ∼ 2.0 × 10−7M⊙ yr−1) consistent with those of EXors. More generally, we derived the relationships between accretion and stellar parameters in a sample of EXors. We find that, when in burst, the accretion parameters become almost independent of the stellar parameters and that EXors, even in quiescence, are more efficient than classical T Tauri stars in assembling mass.

Millimeter and submillimeter observations of continuum linear dust polarization provide insight into dust grain growth in protoplanetary disks, which are the progenitors of planetary systems. We present the results of the first survey of dust polarization in protoplanetary disks at 870 μm and 3 mm. We find that protoplanetary disks in the same molecular cloud at similar evolutionary stages can exhibit different correlations between observing wavelength and polarization morphology and fraction. We explore possible origins for these differences in polarization, including differences in dust populations and protostar properties. For RY Tau and MWC 480, which are consistent with scattering at both wavelengths, we present models of the scattering polarization from several dust grain size distributions. These models aim to reproduce two features of the observational results for these disks: (1) both disks have an observable degree of polarization at both wavelengths; and (2) the polarization fraction is higher at 3 mm than at 870 μm in the centers of the disks. For both disks, these features can be reproduced by a power-law distribution of spherical dust grains with a maximum radius of 200 μm and high optical depth. In MWC 480, we can also reproduce features (1) and (2) with a model containing large grains (amax = 490 μm) near the disk midplane and small grains (amax = 140 μm) above and below the midplane.

<title>First Detection in Space of the High-energy Isomer of Cyanomethanimine: H2CNCN</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the first detection in the interstellar medium of N-cyanomethanimine (H2CNCN), the stable dimer of HCN of highest energy and the most complex organic molecule identified in space containing the prebiotically relevant NCN backbone. We have identified a plethora of a-type rotational transitions with 3 ≤ Jup ≤ 11 and Ka ≤ 2 that belong to this species toward the Galactic center G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud, the only interstellar source showing the three cyanomethanimine isomers (including the Z- and E-isomers of C-cyanomethanimine, HNCHCN). We have derived a total column density for H2CNCN of (2.9 ± 0.1) × 1012 cm−2, which translates into a total molecular abundance with respect to H2 of (2.1 ± 0.3) × 10−11. We have also revisited the previous detection of E- and Z-HNCHCN and found a total C/N-cyanomethanimine abundance ratio of 31.8 ± 1.8 and a Z/E-HNCHCN ratio of 4.5 ± 0.2. While the latter can be explained on the basis of thermodynamic equilibrium, chemical kinetics are more likely responsible for the observed C/N-cyanomethanimine abundance ratio, where the gas-phase reaction between methanimine (CH2NH) and the cyanogen radical (CN) arises as the primary formation route.

<title>Impact of Ejecta Temperature and Mass on the Strength of Heavy Element Signatures in Kilonovae</title>

A kilonova, the electromagnetic emission produced by compact binary mergers, is formed through a delicate interplay of physical processes, involving r-process nucleosynthesis and interactions between heavy elements and photons through radiative transfer. This complexity makes it difficult to achieve a comprehensive understanding of kilonova spectra. In this study, we aim to enhance our understanding and establish connections between physical parameters and observables through radiative-transfer simulations. Specifically, we investigate how ejecta temperature and element mass influence the resulting kilonova spectrum. For each species, the strength of its line features depends on these parameters, leading to the formation of a distinct region in the parameter space, dubbed the resonance island, where the line signature of that species is notably evident in the kilonova spectrum. We explore its origin and applications. Among explored r-process elements (31 ≤ Z ≤ 92), we find that four species—SrII, YII, BaII, and CeII—exhibit large and strong resonance islands, suggesting their significant contributions to kilonova spectra at specific wavelengths. In addition, we discuss potential challenges and future perspectives in observable heavy elements and their masses in the context of the resonance island.

<title>The Impact-driven Atmospheric Loss of Super-Earths around Different Spectral Types of Host Stars</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A planet’s mass loss is important for the its formation and evolution. The radius valley (RV) is believed to be triggered by evaporation-induced mass loss. As an alternative mechanism for RV, the mass loss of post-impact planets is thoroughly investigated in this work. The impact energy is converted to the planet’s internal energy, enhancing its core energy and accelerating mass loss and orbital migration. As the host star changes from K type to F type, the planet’s mass loss and orbital migration increase. When the initial gas-to-core-mass ratio is small, the migration efficiency for planets around K-type stars will increase, which helps to suppress mass loss and retain the planet’s mass and radius within a specific range. On the contrary, planets around more massive F-type stars experience more substantial mass loss, potentially leading to complete mass loss, and migrate to orbits with longer periods. Our calculation shows that planets around different spectral types of host stars give rise to an RV ranging from 1.3 to 2.0 R⊕, consistent with the observed range of 1.3–2.6 R⊕. Despite the presence of uncertain parameters, the planetesimal impact can promote the RV establishment for planets around host stars of different spectral types.

<title>Age Determination of LAMOST Red Giant Branch Stars Based on the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree Method</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3b90</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this study, we estimate the stellar ages of LAMOST DR8 red giant branch (RGB) stars based on the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm. We used 2643 RGB stars extracted from the APOKASC-2 asteroseismological catalog as the training data set. After selecting the parameters ([α/Fe], [C/Fe], Teff, [N/Fe], [C/H], log g) highly correlated with age using GBDT, we apply the same GBDT method to the new catalog of more than 590,000 stars classified as RGB stars. The test data set shows that the median relative error is around 11.6% for the method. We also compare the predicted ages of RGB stars with other studies (e.g., based on APOGEE) and find some systematic differences. The final uncertainty is about 15%–30% compared to the ages of open clusters. Then, we present the spatial distribution of the RGB sample with an age determination, which could recreate the expected result, and discuss systematic biases. All these diagnostics show that one can apply the GBDT method to other stellar samples to estimate atmospheric parameters and age.

<title>The Role of Stochastic Fermi-type Particle Acceleration in the Inner Jets of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
High-resolution radio observations of nearby active galactic nuclei have revealed extended, limb-brightened structures in their inner jets. This ties in with other multiwavelength observations from radio to X-ray and gamma ray, indicating that a structured jet model is required. While electrons need to be kept energized to account for the observed features, the underlying particle acceleration mechanism is still unclear. We explore the role of stochastic Fermi-type particle acceleration, i.e., classical second-order Fermi and shear acceleration, for understanding the multiwavelength observations of the inner jets of M87. An analytical Fokker–Planck description is adopted to infer characteristic spectral indices and cutoff energies for these two mechanisms. We focus on electron synchrotron radiation as the dominant emission process. We find that the multiwavelength observations of M87 can be satisfactorily accounted for in a framework, where the X-rays are produced at a larger distance from the core than the radio emission region. This provides further support to multizone, broadband emission modeling. We use our findings to also comment on the acceleration of cosmic rays entrained in the sheath.

Iron line spectroscopy has been one of the leading methods not only for measuring the spins of accreting black holes but also for testing fundamental physics. Basing on such a method, we present an analysis of a data set observed simultaneously by NuSTAR and NICER for the black hole binary candidate MAXI J1803-298, which shows prominent relativistic reflection features. Various relxill_nk flavors are utilized to test the Kerr black hole hypothesis. The results obtained from our analysis provide stringent constraints on Johannsen deformation parameter α13 with the highest precise to date, namely from relxillD_nk and from relxillion_nk, respectively, in 3σ credible lever, where the Johannsen metric reduces to the Kerr metric when α13 vanishes. Furthermore, we investigate the best model fit results using Akaike information criterion and assess its systematic uncertainties.

<title>Intrinsic Emission of PSR B1937+21 at 327 MHz</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3c35</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
At 327 MHz, the observed emission of PSR B1937+21 is greatly affected by scattering in the interstellar medium, on a timescale of order the pulse period. We use the bright impulsive giant pulses emitted by the pulsar to measure the impulse response of the interstellar medium and then recover the intrinsic emission of the pulsar by deconvolution—revealing fine structure on timescales not normally observable. We find that the intrinsic widths of the main pulse and interpulse in the pulse profile are similar to those measured at higher frequencies. We detect 60,270 giant pulses, which typically appear as narrow, ∼100 ns bursts consisting of one to a few nanoshots with widths ≲ 10 ns. However, about 10% of the giant pulses exhibit multiple bursts that seem to be causally related to each other. We also report the first detection of giant micropulses in PSR B1937+21, primarily associated with the regular main pulse emission. These are distinct from giant pulses not only in the phases at which they occur, but also in their larger widths, of order a microsecond, and steeper energy distribution. These measurements place useful observational constraints on emission mechanisms for giant pulses as well as the regular radio emission of millisecond pulsars.

<title>Mass Flows in Expanding Coronal Loops</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3c3c</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3c3c</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An expansion of the cross-sectional area directly impacts the mass flow along a coronal loop and significantly alters the radiative and hydrodynamic evolution of that loop as a result. Previous studies have found that an area expansion from the chromosphere to the corona significantly lengthens the cooling time of the corona and appears to suppress draining from the corona. In this work, we examine the fluid dynamics to understand how the mass flow rate, the energy balance, and the cooling and draining timescales are affected by a nonuniform area. We find that in loops with moderate or large expansion (cross-sectional area expansion factors of 2, 3, 10, 30, 100 from the photosphere to the apex), impulsive heating, for either direct thermal heating or electron beam heating, induces a steady flow into the corona, so that the coronal density continues to rise during the cooling phase, whereas a uniform loop drains during the cooling phase. The induced upflow carries energy into the corona, balancing the losses from thermal conduction, and continues until thermal conduction weakens enough so that it can no longer support the radiative losses of the transition region. As a result, the plasma cools primarily radiatively until the onset of catastrophic collapse. The speed and duration of the induced upflow both increase in proportion to the rate of area expansion. We argue that observations of blueshifted spectral lines, therefore, could place a constraint on a loop’s area expansion.

<title>Interaction between a Coronal Mass Ejection and Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The interaction between a coronal mass ejection (CME) and a comet has been observed several times by in situ observations from the Rosetta Plasma Consortium, which is designed to investigate the cometary magnetosphere of comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko (CG). Goetz et al. reported a magnetic field of up to 300 nT measured in the inner coma, which is among the largest interplanetary magnetic fields observed in the solar system. They suggested the large magnetic field observations in the inner coma come from magnetic field pileup regions, which are generated by the interaction between a CME and/or corotating interaction region and the cometary magnetosphere. However, the detailed interaction between a CME and the cometary magnetosphere of comet CG in the inner coma has not been investigated by numerical simulations yet. In this paper, we will use a numerical model to simulate the interaction between comet CG and a Halloween class CME and investigate its magnetospheric response to the CME. We find that the plasma structures change significantly during the CME event, and the maximum value of the magnetic field strength is more than 500 nT close to the nucleus. Virtual satellites at similar distances as Rosetta show that the magnetic field strength can be as large as 250 nT, which is slightly less than what Goetz et al. reported.

<title>JWST Photometric Time-delay and Magnification Measurements for the Triply Imaged Type Ia “SN H0pe” at z = 1.78</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Supernova (SN) SN H0pe is a gravitationally lensed, triply imaged, Type Ia SN (SN Ia) discovered in James Webb Space Telescope imaging of the PLCK G165.7+67.0 cluster of galaxies. Well-observed multiply imaged SNe provide a rare opportunity to constrain the Hubble constant (H0), by measuring the relative time delay between the images and modeling the foreground mass distribution. SN H0pe is located at z = 1.783 and is the first SN Ia with sufficient light-curve sampling and long enough time delays for an H0 inference. Here we present photometric time-delay measurements and SN properties of SN H0pe. Using JWST/NIRCam photometry, we measure time delays of Δtab = observer-frame days and Δtcb = observer-frame days relative to the last image to arrive (image 2b; all uncertainties are 1σ), which corresponds to a ∼5.6% uncertainty contribution for H0 assuming 70 km s−1 Mpc−1. We also constrain the absolute magnification of each image to μa = , μb = , μc = by comparing the observed peak near-IR magnitude of SN H0pe to the nonlensed population of SNe Ia.

<title>Mass Ejection Driven by Sudden Energy Deposition in Stellar Envelopes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A number of stellar astrophysical phenomena, such as tidal novae and planetary engulfment, involve sudden injection of subbinding energy in a thin layer within the star, leading to mass ejection of the stellar envelope. We use a 1D hydrodynamical model to survey the stellar response and mass loss for various amounts (Edep) and locations of the energy deposition. We find that the total mass ejection has a nontrivial dependence on Edep due to the varying strengths of mass ejection events, which are associated with density/pressure waves breaking out from the stellar surface. The rapid occurrence of multiple breakouts may present a unique observational signature for sudden envelope heating events in stars.

<div> 关键词: 快速无线电爆发，DSA-110，FRB，星系，星形成<br />
总结: <br />这篇文章介绍了快速无线电爆发（FRBs）以及通过DSA-110发现的首批FRBs和它们的宿主星系。通过关联FRBs和宿主星系，研究人员得以测量内在和环境特性，测试FRB起源模型，并将它们用作遥远宇宙气体的精确探测器。该样本包括11个FRBs，是迄今为止最大、最统一的本地化FRB样本，选择标准基于Pan-STARRS1的光学成像识别出的宿主星系。大多数宿主星系正在经历星形成，与之前的FRB宿主相类似。然而，这一样本中有两个宿主星系是巨大而平静的星系。星系样本的星形成历史分布显示出宽广的延迟时间分布，需通过与老年恒星群体相关的一个或多个祖代星体形成渠道的存在，例如致密天体的双星演化。 <br /> <div>
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a powerful and mysterious new class of transients that are luminous enough to be detected at cosmological distances. By associating FRBs to host galaxies, we can measure intrinsic and environmental properties that test FRB origin models, in addition to using them as precise probes of distant cosmic gas. The Deep Synoptic Array (DSA-110) is a radio interferometer built to maximize the rate at which it can simultaneously detect and localize FRBs. Here, we present the first sample of FRBs and host galaxies discovered by the DSA-110. This sample of 11 FRBs is the largest, most uniform sample of localized FRBs to date, as it is selected based on association with host galaxies identified in optical imaging by Pan-STARRS1. These FRBs have not been observed to repeat, and their radio properties (dispersion, temporal scattering, energy) are similar to that of the known nonrepeating FRB population. Most host galaxies have ongoing star formation, as has been identified before for FRB hosts. Two hosts of the new sample are massive, quiescent galaxies. The distribution of star formation history across this host-galaxy sample shows that the delay time distribution is wide, with a power-law model that spans from ∼100 Myr to ≳2 Gyr. This requires the existence of one or more progenitor formation channels associated with old stellar populations, such as the binary evolution of compact objects.

<div> 关键词: baryons, fast radio bursts (FRBs), feedback, ionized baryons, simulations<br />
<br />总结: 该研究利用快速射电暴(FRBs)测量电子色散测量，以解决遗失的重子问题并约束宇宙中的反馈历史。通过分析三种模拟套件中的183个模型，发现它们在预测上存在显著差异，主要是由于反馈实现的不同。其中SIMBA的反馈最强，Astrid的反馈最弱，而IllustrisTNG对超新星反馈最敏感。研究发现，黑洞而不是恒星最有能力重新分布宇宙中和星系周围的重子物质。这些统计数据为利用FRBs约束星系形成和演化的物理学奠定了基础。 <br /> <div>
Most diffuse baryons, including the circumgalactic medium (CGM) surrounding galaxies and the intergalactic medium (IGM) in the cosmic web, remain unmeasured and unconstrained. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) offer an unparalleled method to measure the electron dispersion measures (DMs) of ionized baryons. Their distribution can resolve the missing baryon problem and constrain the history of feedback theorized to impart significant energy to the CGM and IGM. We analyze the Cosmology and Astrophysics with Machine Learning Simulations using three suites, IllustrisTNG, SIMBA, and Astrid, each varying six parameters (two cosmological and four astrophysical feedback), for a total of 183 distinct simulation models. We find significantly different predictions between the fiducial models of the suites owing to their different implementations of feedback. SIMBA exhibits the strongest feedback, leading to the smoothest distribution of baryons and reducing the sight-line-to-sight-line variance in DMs between z = 0 and 1. Astrid has the weakest feedback and the largest variance. We calculate FRB CGM measurements as a function of galaxy impact parameter, with SIMBA showing the weakest DMs due to aggressive active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback and Astrid the strongest. Within each suite, the largest differences are due to varying AGN feedback. IllustrisTNG shows the most sensitivity to supernova feedback, but this is due to the change in the AGN feedback strengths, demonstrating that black holes, not stars, are most capable of redistributing baryons in the IGM and CGM. We compare our statistics directly to recent observations, paving the way for the use of FRBs to constrain the physics of galaxy formation and evolution.

<div> 关键词: 贝叶斯合成, 超大质量黑洞, 多波段数据, 天体测量, 计算机模拟

总结:
贝叶斯合成是一种潜在的方法，可以从不同仪器的多波段数据中提取出超大质量黑洞的轨道参数和各自的光变曲线。未来的干涉仪将可以观测到质量较大的超大质量黑洞的星震。结合这些观测数据和来自调查项目如Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time的定期变化时域数据，可以比独立的观测方法提供更多有关超大质量黑洞候选者的信息。该方法可以从长期、中期和短期的二进制动力学和观测配置中可靠地确定二进制参数和组分流量，假设每年进行10次观测，即使在“q-accrete”类型的短周期物体中也适用。从二进制动力学参数构建的预期超大质量黑洞星震可能有助于改进超大质量黑洞的观测策略。推断的质量比、二进制组分的光变曲线和观测到的光心星震组合可以成为超大质量黑洞组分活动状态的代理。 <div>
We test the potential of Bayesian synthesis of upcoming multi-instrument data to extract orbital parameters and individual light curves of close binary supermassive black holes (CB-SMBH) with subparsec separations. Next-generation interferometers, will make possible the observation of astrometric wobbles in CB-SMBH. Combining them with periodic variable time-domain data from surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time, allows for more information on CB-SMBH candidates compared to standalone observational methods. Our method reliably determines binary parameters and component fluxes from binary total flux across long-term, intermediate, and short-term binary dynamics and observational configurations, assuming 10 annual observations, even in short period “q-accrete” objects. Expected CB-SMBH astrometric wobbles constructed from binary dynamical parameters might serve in refining observational strategies for CB-SMBH. Combination of inferred mass ratio, light curves of binary components, and observed photocenter wobbles can be a proxy for the activity states of CB-SMBH components.

These galaxies fall on the star formation main sequence and are typical star-forming galaxies with UV magnitudes of −22.5 ≤ MUV ≤ −17.0. We find that 15 out of 53 galaxies show Lyα emission at the >3σ level, and we obtain Lyα equivalent width (EW) measurements and stringent 3σ upper limits for the 15 and 38 galaxies, respectively. Confirming that Lyα velocity offsets and line widths of our galaxies are comparable to those of low-redshift Lyα emitters, we investigate the redshift evolution of the Lyα EW. We find that Lyα EWs statistically decrease toward high redshifts on the Lyα EW versus the MUV plane for various probability distributions of the uncertainties. We then evaluate neutral hydrogen fractions xH I with the redshift evolution of the Lyα EW and the cosmic reionization simulation results on the basis of a Bayesian inference framework, and obtain xH I < 0.79, , and at z ∼ 7, 8, and 9–13, respectively. These moderately large xH I values are consistent with the Planck cosmic microwave background optical depth measurement and previous xH I constraints from galaxy and QSO Lyα damping wing absorption and strongly indicate a late reionization history. Such a late reionization history suggests that major sources of reionization would emerge late and be hosted by moderately massive halos compared with the widely accepted picture of abundant low-mass objects for the sources of reionization.

<div> 关键词: HADAR, Cherenkov Telescope, gamma-ray astronomy, GRBs, observational results
总结: <br /><br />这篇研究主要介绍了一种名为HADAR的新型Cherenkov望远镜，其设计用于观测10 GeV到100 TeV能量范围内的宇宙射线，并将伽马射线爆发作为其主要研究重点之一。研究首先展示了HADAR对蟹状星云的敏感度，并对GRBs的敏感度进行了比较，标准观测时间为100秒。研究发现，HADAR能更全面地记录自衍康普顿辐射的弯曲和吸收，填补了空间和地面实验的观测空白。这种设施将确保大量GRB样本的统计数据，并推动我们对GRBs的理解。 <div>
The High Altitude Detection of Astronomical Radiation (HADAR) is a novel wide-field Cherenkov Telescope. It is designed for gamma-ray astronomy in the energy range of 10 GeV to 100 TeV, with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) being one of its primary research focuses. To assess its complementary capabilities, this study first presents the Crab sensitivity of HADAR. Then, to compare the sensitivity of GRBs, the observation time for all experiments is standardized to 100 s. To clearly demonstrate HADAR’s advantages, we estimate its observational results with a 221009A-like GRB. The study found that HADAR is capable of more comprehensively recording the bending and absorption of self-Compton radiation, which is expected to fill observational gaps in space- and ground-based experiments. We anticipate that this facility will ensure a large statistical GRB sample and advance our understanding of GRBs.

<div> 关键词: z ≳ 6 quasars, ULAS J1342+0928, Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) candidates, Hubble Space Telescope (HST), clustering analysis<br />
总结:<br />研究关于 z = 7.54 明亮类星体ULAS J1342+0928的1.1Mpc²环境。使用HST进行深度成像，发现一个与类星体相距223kpc的LBG。对之前ALMA发现的一个[C ii]辐射体未发现HST对应体。LBG候选体的完整性估计结果表明，>50% z ∼ 7.5 LBGs被忽视，由于F105W缺少Lyman断裂红边滤波器。通过QSO-LBG聚类分析，发现此类星体的LBG过度需求较低，与平均或低密度的领域一致。最后，鉴定两个LBG候选体的zphot与类星体视线上一个已确认的z = 6.84吸收体匹配。所有这些星系候选体都是进一步观测的极好目标，以确认它们的红移和物理特性。 <div>
Theoretical models predict that z ≳ 6 quasars are hosted in the most massive halos of the underlying dark matter distribution and thus would be immersed in protoclusters of galaxies. However, observations report inconclusive results. We investigate the 1.1 proper-Mpc2 environment of the z = 7.54 luminous quasar ULAS J1342+0928. We search for Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) candidates using deep imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS)/F814W, Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3)/F105W/F125W bands, and Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera at 3.6 and 4.5 μm. We report a LBG with magF125W = 26.41 at 223 projected proper kpc (pkpc) from the quasar. We find no HST counterpart to one [C ii] emitter previously found with the Atacama Large millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 27 projected pkpc and z[C II]=7.5341 ± 0.0009 (Venemans et al. 2020). We estimate the completeness of our LBG candidates using results from Cosmic Assembly Near-Infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey/GOODS deep blank field searches sharing a similar filter setup. We find that >50% of the z ∼ 7.5 Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) with magF125W > 25.5 are missed due to the absence of a filter redward of the Lyman break in F105W, hindering the UV color accuracy of the candidates. We conduct a QSO-LBG clustering analysis revealing a low LBG excess of in this quasar field, consistent with an average or low-density field. Consequently, this result does not present strong evidence of an LBG overdensity around ULAS J1342+0928. Furthermore, we identify two LBG candidates with a zphot matching a confirmed z = 6.84 absorber along the line of sight to the quasar. All these galaxy candidates are excellent targets for follow-up observations with JWST and/or ALMA to confirm their redshift and physical properties.

The gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB 211211A is believed to have occurred due to the merger of two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole, despite its duration of more than a minute. Subsequent analysis has revealed numerous interesting properties including the possible presence of a ∼22 Hz quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) during precursor emission. Here we perform timing analysis of Fermi and Swift gamma-ray data on GRB 211211A and, although we do not find a strong QPO during the precursor, we do find an extremely significant 19.5 Hz flux oscillation, which has higher fractional amplitude at higher energies, in a ∼0.2 s segment beginning ∼1.6 s after the start of the burst. After presenting our analysis we discuss possible mechanisms for the oscillation.

<div> 磁流体动力学湍流、AGN、吸积盘、X射线重照、时间延迟

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了活跃星系核（AGN）吸积盘中的磁流体动力学湍流对温度波动的影响，指出这些波动会导致吸积盘不均匀性，并与一些塞弗特1型AGN的连续反应映射结果不符。研究还表明X射线重照模型中的时间延迟与磁流体动力学湍流有关，并且应该在模拟中加以考虑。此外，文章还提到了X射线和盘发射之间的交叉相关性较弱，与最近的连续反应映射结果一致。 <div>
Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence can drive significant temperature fluctuations in the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). As a result, the disk can be highly inhomogeneous and has a half-light radius larger than the static Shakura and Sunyaev disk (SSD), in agreement with quasar microlensing observations. Meanwhile, the accretion-disk sizes can also be determined using continuum reverberation mappings that measure interband cross-correlations and time lags. The interband time lags are often understood in the X-ray reprocessing scenario. Here we show that the interband continuum time lags of the X-ray reprocessing of an inhomogeneous disk are similar to or even smaller than those of a static SSD. Consequently, the X-ray reprocessing of an inhomogeneous disk cannot account for the recent continuum reverberation mappings of some Seyfert 1 AGNs, whose measured time lags are larger than those of a static SSD. In contrast to the tight correlation between UV/optical variations, the cross-correlation between X-ray and disk emission is rather weak in this model; this behavior is consistent with recent continuum reverberation mappings. Moreover, the time lags in this model are anticorrelated with the amplitude of disk temperature fluctuations. Our results suggest that the temperature fluctuations should be properly considered when modeling interband continuum time lags.

<div> circumbinary accretion, mass ratio, disk thickness, viscosity, inspirals
总结:<br /><br />
这篇文章对环双星吸积盘进行了广泛的研究，研究了质量比从0.01到1的循环二进制系统。他们发现，质量比较低的二进制系统会导致减速运动，而在一些情况下，吸积盘会产生偏心模式，加速二进制系统的合并过程。研究还表明，粘度对副星的优先吸积程度产生重要影响，解决了以前研究的不一致之处。冷的环双星吸积盘即使在质量比约为0.01时仍保持着偏心性，并维持着深远的不对称空洞。黑洞吸积的变化与盘的偏心性相关，即使在质量比为0.01时也观察到了10%以上的变化。 <div>
Circumbinary accretion occurs throughout the universe, from the formation of stars and planets to the aftermath of major galactic mergers. We present an extensive investigation of circumbinary accretion disks, studying circular binaries with mass ratios (q ≡ M2/M1) from 0.01 to 1 and at each mass ratio probing the effects of disk thickness and viscosity. We study disks with aspect ratios H/r ∈ {0.1, 0.05, 0.03} and vary both the magnitude and spatial dependence of viscosity. Although thin accretion disks have previously been found to promote rapid inspirals of equal-mass binaries, we find that gravitational torques become weaker at lower mass ratios and most binaries with 0.01 ≤ q ≤ 0.04 outspiral, which may delay the coalescence of black hole binaries formed from minor mergers and cause high-mass exoplanets to migrate outward. However, in a number of cases, the disks accreting onto binaries with mass ratios ∼0.07 fail to develop eccentric modes, leading to extremely rapid inspirals. Variability in black hole accretion correlates with disk eccentricity, and we observe variability above the ∼10% level even for mass ratios of 0.01. We demonstrate that the spatial dependence of the viscosity (e.g., α vs. constant ν) significantly affects the degree of preferential accretion onto the secondary, resolving discrepancies between previous studies. Colder circumbinary disks remain eccentric even at q ∼ 0.01 and sustain deep, asymmetric cavities.

<div> 太阳，纳米耀斑，等离子发射，模拟，太阳活动监测

总结: 本研究通过模拟纳米耀斑加热等离子体的辐射，以太阳观测卫星的数据验证了这一模拟结果。研究结果显示，通过分析太阳观测卫星的数据，可以推断出纳米耀斑的存在及其加热频率。太阳观测卫星数据显示，在研究的X射线明亮点的观测中，平均延迟时间为1500-3000秒的纳米耀斑分布能够很好地匹配观测到的发射。此外，研究还发现，Marshall Grazing Incidence X-ray Spectrometer (MaGIXS) 和X射线望远镜（XRT）对于诊断加热频率具有很高的灵敏度，而太阳动力学观测卫星（SDO）上的大气成像组件（AIA）的波段对此的灵敏度最低。 <div>
Nanoflares are thought to be one of the prime candidates that can heat the solar corona to its multimillion kelvin temperature. Individual nanoflares are difficult to detect with the present generation of instruments, but their presence can be inferred by comparing simulated nanoflare-heated plasma emissions with the observed emission. Using HYDRAD coronal loop simulations, we model the emission from an X-ray bright point (XBP) observed by the Marshall Grazing Incidence X-ray Spectrometer (MaGIXS), along with the nearest available observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) on board the Hinode observatory. The length and magnetic field strength of the coronal loops are derived from the linear force-free extrapolation of the observed photospheric magnetogram by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board SDO. Each loop is assumed to be heated by random nanoflares, whose magnitude and frequency are determined by the loop length and magnetic field strength. The simulation results are then compared and matched against the measured intensity from AIA, XRT, and MaGIXS. Our model results indicate the observed emission from the XBP under study could be well matched by a distribution of nanoflares with average delay times 1500–3000 s. Further, we demonstrate the high sensitivity of MaGIXS and XRT for diagnosing the heating frequency using this method, while AIA passbands are found to be the least sensitive.

<title>Resolved Near-infrared Stellar Photometry from the Magellan Telescope for 13 Nearby Galaxies: J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch Method Distances</title>

总结: 本研究使用近红外JHK光度测量了13个附近星系的恒星群。使用JAGB方法和TRGB方法测量了各星系的距离，并通过比较两种方法的残差验证了其可靠性。最终的JAGB星光度函数显示出高度对称的高斯分布特征。这项研究为星系距离测量提供了新的方法，并为恒星群的研究提供了宝贵的数据。 <div>
We present near-infrared JHK photometry for the resolved stellar populations in 13 nearby galaxies: NGC 6822, IC 1613, NGC 3109, Sextans B, Sextans A, NGC 300, NGC 55, NGC 7793, NGC 247, NGC 5253, Cen A, NGC 1313, and M83, acquired from the 6.5 m Baade–Magellan telescope. We measure distances to each galaxy using the J-region asymptotic giant branch (JAGB) method, a new standard candle that leverages the constant luminosities of color-selected, carbon-rich AGB stars. While only single-epoch, random-phase photometry is necessary to derive JAGB distances, our photometry is time-averaged over multiple epochs, thereby decreasing the contribution of the JAGB stars’ intrinsic variability to the measured dispersions in their observed luminosity functions. To cross-validate these distances, we also measure near-infrared tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distances to these galaxies. The residuals obtained from subtracting the distance moduli from the two methods yield an rms scatter of σJAGB−TRGB = ±0.07 mag. Therefore, all systematics in the JAGB method and TRGB method (e.g., crowding, differential reddening, star formation histories) must be contained within these ±0.07 mag bounds for this sample of galaxies because the JAGB and TRGB distance indicators are drawn from entirely distinct stellar populations and are thus affected by these systematics independently. Finally, the composite JAGB star luminosity function formed from this diverse sample of galaxies is well described by a Gaussian function with a modal value of MJ = –6.20 ± 0.003 mag (stat), indicating that the underlying JAGB star luminosity function of a well-sampled full star formation history is highly symmetric and Gaussian based on over 6700 JAGB stars in the composite sample.

<div> 关键词: 暗物质，宇宙学，模拟，星系，粒子物理
总结:
本文使用了宇宙学水动力学缩放模拟探索了类似于银河系的星系中含有原子暗物质（ADM）的亚哈洛的特性。ADM由于具有能量耗散而不同于冷暗物质（CDM），这源于自相互作用。采用了GIZMO进行模拟，并利用了标准模型的巴里物质所采用的FIRE-2星系形成物理机制。ADM气体能有效冷却并塌缩到亚哈洛的中心，增加了亚哈洛的中心密度并影响其轨道。具有卫星星系的亚哈洛子集具有更尖锐的密度剖面和较小的恒星半质量半径。在ADM模拟中产生的矮星系总体上比CDM模拟中的更紧凑，无法复制观测到的矮星系结构的整个多样性。此外，还确定了一群高度紧凑的亚哈洛，几乎完全由ADM组成，并且形成在宿主的中心区域，在那里它们能留下清晰的痕迹。这项工作首次对强耗散暗物质情景中的亚哈洛特性进行了详细探讨，为其他ADM参数空间的以及其他暗物质模型对星系观测可观的影响提供了直觉。 <div>
Using cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations, we explore the properties of subhalos in Milky Way analogs that contain a subcomponent of atomic dark matter (ADM). ADM differs from cold dark matter (CDM) due to the presence of self-interactions that lead to energy dissipation, analogous to standard model baryons. This model can arise in dark sectors that are natural and theoretically motivated extensions to the standard model. The simulations used in this work were carried out using GIZMO and utilize the FIRE-2 galaxy formation physics in the standard model baryonic sector. For the parameter points we consider, the ADM gas cools efficiently, allowing it to collapse to the center of subhalos. This increases a subhalo’s central density and affects its orbit, with more subhalos surviving small pericentric passages. The subset of subhalos that host satellite galaxies have cuspier density profiles and smaller stellar half-mass radii relative to CDM. The entire population of dwarf galaxies produced in the ADM simulations is more compact than those seen in CDM simulations, unable to reproduce the entire diversity of observed dwarf galaxy structures. Additionally, we also identify a population of highly compact subhalos that consist nearly entirely of ADM and form in the central region of the host, where they can leave distinctive imprints in the baryonic disk. This work presents the first detailed exploration of subhalo properties in a strongly dissipative dark matter scenario, providing intuition for how other regions of ADM parameter space, as well as other dark sector models, would impact galactic-scale observables.

We present the second and final release of optical spectroscopy of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) obtained during the first and second phases of the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP-I and CSP-II). The newly released data consist of 148 spectra of 30 SNe Ia observed in the course of CSP-I and 234 spectra of 127 SNe Ia obtained during CSP-II. We also present 216 optical spectra of 46 historical SNe Ia, including 53 spectra of 30 SNe Ia observed by the Calán/Tololo Supernova Survey. We combine these observations with previously published CSP data and publicly available spectra to compile a large sample of measurements of spectroscopic parameters at maximum light, consisting of pseudo-equivalent widths and expansion velocities of selected features for 232 CSP and historical SNe Ia (including more than 1000 spectra). Finally, we review some of the strongest correlations between spectroscopic and photometric properties of SNe Ia. Specifically, we define two samples: one consisting of SNe Ia discovered by targeted searches (most of them CSP-I objects) and the other composed of SNe Ia discovered by untargeted searches, which includes most of the CSP-II objects. The analyzed correlations are similar for both samples. We find a larger incidence of SNe Ia belonging to the cool and broad-line Branch subtypes among the events discovered by targeted searches, shallow-silicon SNe Ia are present with similar frequencies in both samples, while core normal SNe Ia are more frequent in untargeted searches.

Large amplitude Alfvénic fluctuations, sometimes leading to localized inversions of the magnetic field, called switchbacks, are a common but poorly understood phenomenon in the solar wind. In particular, their origin(s), evolution, and stability within solar wind conditions are yet to be fully understood. Simulations modeling switchbacks have previously studied their stability in 2D. Here, we investigate the decay process of Alfvén wave packets via MHD simulations in 3D by characterizing the effects of system size, aspect ratio, and propagation angle on the decay rate. We show that the initial wave packet is unstable to parametric instabilities that develop compressible and Alfvénic secondary modes in the plane of, and transverse to, the initial wave packet propagation direction. The growth of transverse modes, absent in 2D simulations, increases the decay rate of the wave packet. We finally discuss the implications of our results for lifetime estimates of switchbacks and wave energy conversion in the solar wind.

总结: <br />研究报告了对邻近螺旋星系NGC 628中磁场与kpc尺度气泡结构之间有序排列的检测。利用ALMA-PHANGS的CO光谱数据，测量了NGC 628的磁场尺度为191 pc(∼4″)。大尺度磁场与螺旋臂平行，并环绕着中红外发射观测到的气泡结构。在螺旋臂边缘识别出21个气泡结构，包括两个kpc尺度的结构，这些气泡由超新星遗迹和持续星形成造成，类似于星系盘中中性氢发现的流出通道。在气泡边缘，O iii发射迹线显示了一条弯曲的磁场，与气泡壳平行。磁场跟随气泡扩张并将气体束缚在壳体内以触发进一步的星形成。通过对1694个气泡的更大样本进行分析，发现了NGC 628中气泡的明显径向大小分布，指示了星系中的星形成历史。 <div>
We report the detection of the ordered alignment between the magnetic field and kpc-scale bubbles in the nearby spiral galaxy, NGC 628. Applying the Velocity Gradient Technique on CO spectroscopic data from the ALMA-PHANGS, the magnetic field of NGC 628 is measured at the scale of 191 pc (∼4″). The large-scale magnetic field is oriented parallel to the spiral arms and curves around the galactic bubble structures in the mid-infrared emission observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. A total of 21 bubble structures have been identified at the edges of spiral arms with scales over 300 pc, which includes two kpc-scale structures. These bubbles are caused by supernova remnants and prolonged star formation and are similar to the outflow chimneys found in neutral hydrogen in galactic disks. At the edge of the bubbles, the shocks traced by the O iii emission present a curved magnetic field that parallels the bubble’s shell. The magnetic field follows the bubble expansion and binds the gas in the shell to trigger further star formation. By analyzing the larger sample of 1694 bubbles, we found a distinct radial-size distribution of bubbles in NGC 628 indicating the star formation history in the galaxy.

<div> 超长周期无线电暂现现象, 磁化中子星, 回落盘, 自旋演化, 初始质量吸积率

总结:
这项研究通过模拟发现，磁星和回落盘模型可以解释超长周期无线电暂现现象的周期、周期导数和X射线亮度。J1627可能处于准自旋平衡阶段，需要回落盘的初始质量吸积率和磁场在一定范围内。在回落盘的活跃寿命内，J1839不可能达到观测到的周期导数的上限，因此可能处于回落盘失活后的第二喷射相。具有(2–6) × 1014 G的磁场和初始质量吸积率为∼1024–1026 g s−1的回落盘可能是J1839的可能前体。 <div>
Recently, two ultralong-period radio transients, GLEAM-X J162759.5-523504.3 (J1627) and GPM J1839-10 (J1839), were discovered with spin periods longer than 1000 s. The origin of these two ultralong-period radio transients is intriguing in understanding the spin evolution of neutron stars (NSs). In this work, we examine whether the interaction between strong magnetized NSs and fallback disks can spin NSs down to the observed ultralong period. Our simulations found that the magnetar + fallback disk model can account for the observed period, period derivative, and X-ray luminosity of J1627 in the quasi-spin-equilibrium stage. To evolve to the current state of J1627, the initial mass-accretion rate of the fallback disk and the magnetic field of the NS are in the range of (1.1–30) × 1024 g s−1 and (2–5) × 1014 G, respectively. In the active lifetime of the fallback disk, it is impossible for J1839 to achieve the observed upper limit of the period derivative. Therefore, we propose that J1839 may be in the second ejector phase after the fallback disk becomes inactive. Those NSs with a magnetic field of (2–6) × 1014 G and a fallback disk with an initial mass-accretion rate of ∼1024–1026 g s−1 are possible progenitors of J1839.

<div> PAC approach, spectroscopic surveys, photometric surveys, excess surface density, subhalo abundance-matching method
<br />总结:
研究利用PAC方法，在红移0.8 < zs < 1.0的夸asar周围测量了相邻星系的过量表面密度，得出这些密度随着距离减小急剧增加。通过亚暗物质丰度匹配方法，可以准确地对小尺度和大尺度的数据进行建模。研究发现，大部分夸asar应该是大质量暗物质中的卫星，而且大尺度环境对夸asar活动影响不大。高卫星比例表明暗物质几乎具有相同的概率来容纳夸asar，而大尺度环境对夸asar活动影响不大。另外，尽管卫星比例很高，但每个大质量暗物质平均不会容纳多于一个卫星夸asar，这也是夸asar稀疏的原因。 <div>
The Photometric objects Around Cosmic webs (PAC) approach developed in Xu et al. has the advantage of making full use of spectroscopic and deeper photometric surveys. With the merits of PAC, the excess surface density of neighboring galaxies can be measured down to stellar mass 1010.80M⊙ around quasars at redshift 0.8 < zs < 1.0, with the data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Imaging Surveys. We find that generally increases quite steeply with the decrease of the separation. Using the subhalo abundance-matching method, we can accurately model the both on small and large scales. We show that the steep increase of toward the quasars requires that a large fraction of quasars should be satellites in massive halos, and we find that this fraction measurement is insensitive to the assumptions of our modeling. This high satellite fraction indicates that the subhalos have nearly the same probability of hosting quasars as the halos for the same (infall) halo mass and that the large-scale environment has negligible effect on the quasar activity. We show that even with this high satellite fraction, each massive halo on average does not host more than one satellite quasar, due to the sparsity of quasars.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章对大麦哲伦星系周围的暖气态晕进行了表征，并通过高分辨率数值模拟确定了其总质量和温度。研究发现，在大麦哲伦星系接近银河之前和之后，都能够保持稳定的暖气态晕。数值模拟得出，大麦哲伦星系的暖气态晕总质量大于2 × 10^9M⊙，温度为3 × 10^5 K，能够很好地复现观测到的尾迹流的中性和电离组分总质量、大麦哲伦星系盘的大小、尾迹流的星际物质形态以及电离气体的在天空上的大小。这表明暖气态晕在大麦哲伦星系和尾迹流的存活、形态和组成中起着至关重要的作用。 <div>
We characterize the Magellanic Corona, the warm gaseous halo around the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The Corona is a key ingredient in the formation of the Magellanic Stream and has recently been observed in high-ion absorption around the LMC. In this work, we present a suite of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations to constrain its total mass and temperature prior to the infall of the Magellanic Clouds to our Galaxy. We find that the LMC is able to host a stable Corona before and during its approach to the MW through to the present day. With a Magellanic Corona of >2 × 109M⊙ at 3 × 105 K, our simulations can reproduce the observed total mass of the neutral and ionized components of the Trailing Stream, the size of the LMC disk, the ionization fractions along the Stream, the morphology of the neutral gas, and the on-sky extent of the ionized gas. The Corona plays an integral role in the survival, morphology, and composition of the Magellanic Clouds and the Trailing Stream.

<div> SPT0418−47, JWST, ALMA, lensing system, star-forming galaxy
<br />
这篇文章报告了关于SPT0418−47的望远镜观测，包括JWST和ALMA的成像观测。SPT0418−47包括一个红移为z=4.225的强透镜星际尘埃星系和一个相关的多重成像伴星系。使用JWST NIRCam和MIRI进行的观测提供了对SPT0418A和SPT0418B两个星系中恒星光的稳健多波段检测，而ALMA对[C ii]发射的检测证实了SPT0418B与SPT0418A处于相同的红移。两个星系的投影物理间隔被推断为4.42±0.05千秒差距。我们推导出SPT0418A和SPT0418B的总放大率分别为μ=29±1和μ=4.1±0.7。我们使用prospector和cigale推导了恒星质量，发现SPT0418A的恒星质量为M* = 1.5±0.3×1010M⊙。SPT0418A和SPT0418B的恒星质量比约为4至7。我们观察到与SPT0418A相关的伸展结构，暗示着一种潮汐特征。这些特征以及接近的投影距离表明该系统正在相互作用。有趣的是，这两个星系的星形成速率和恒星质量与这个时期的星系的主序一致，表明这种持续的相互作用并没有明显提升星形成水平。
<br /><br />总结: SPT0418−47是一个包括主星系和伴星系的强透镜系统，通过JWST和ALMA的成像观测得出了两个星系的物理特性和恒星质量比。两个星系的相互作用导致了伸展结构的出现，但并没有明显提升星形成水平。 <div>
We present JWST and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) imaging for the lensing system SPT0418−47, which includes a strongly lensed, dusty, star-forming galaxy at redshift z = 4.225 and an associated multiply imaged companion. The JWST NIRCam and MIRI imaging observations presented in this paper were acquired as part of the Early Release Science program Targeting Extremely Magnified Panchromatic Lensed Arcs and Their Extended Star formation (TEMPLATES). This data set provides robust mutiwavelength detections of stellar light in both the main (SPT0418A) and companion (SPT0418B) galaxies, while the ALMA detection of [C ii] emission confirms that SPT0418B lies at the same redshift as SPT0418A. We infer that the projected physical separation of the two galaxies is 4.42 ± 0.05 kpc. We derive total magnifications of μ = 29 ± 1 and μ = 4.1 ± 0.7 for SPT0418A and SPT0418B, respectively. We use both prospector and cigale to derive stellar masses. We find that SPT0418A has a stellar mass of from prospector or M* = 1.5 ± 0.3 × 1010M⊙ from cigale. The stellar mass ratio of SPT0418A and SPT0418B is roughly between 4 and 7 ( for prospector and 7.5 ± 3.7 for cigale). We see evidence of extended structure associated with SPT0418A that is suggestive of a tidal feature. These features, along with the close projected proximity, imply that the system is interacting. Interestingly, the star formation rates and stellar masses of both galaxies are consistent with the main sequence of star-forming galaxies at this epoch, indicating that this ongoing interaction has not noticeably elevated the star formation levels.

总结:<br />
本文评估了Legacy Survey of Space and Time科学管道的差异图像分析（DIA）在模拟图像上的表现。通过向图像中的星系添加合成源，以评估管道对Dark Energy Science Collaboration数据挑战2图像的注入合成源的恢复情况。管道的性能良好，效率和流量准确性与输入图像的信噪比一致。我们探讨了Alard-Lupton多项式高斯图像减法核的不同空间自由度，并分析了效率与伪迹率之间的权衡。增加核的空间自由度可以降低伪迹率而不损失效率。不同核空间自由度的流量测量是一致的。我们还提供了一组DIA标志，可以从DIA源表中实质性地过滤出伪迹。我们探讨了观察到的剩余减法伪迹的形态和可能的起源，并建议考虑到这些伪迹起源的复杂性，可能需要使用具有空间变化的一组灵活基础的卷积核来进一步改进。 <div>
We evaluate the performance of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time Science Pipelines Difference Image Analysis (DIA) on simulated images. By adding synthetic sources to galaxies on images, we trace the recovery of injected synthetic sources to evaluate the pipeline on images from the Dark Energy Science Collaboration Data Challenge 2. The pipeline performs well, with efficiency and flux accuracy consistent with the signal-to-noise ratio of the input images. We explore different spatial degrees of freedom for the Alard–Lupton polynomial-Gaussian image subtraction kernel and analyze for trade-offs in efficiency versus artifact rate. Increasing the kernel spatial degrees of freedom reduces the artifact rate without loss of efficiency. The flux measurements with different kernel spatial degrees of freedom are consistent. We also here provide a set of DIA flags that substantially filter out artifacts from the DIA source table. We explore the morphology and possible origins of the observed remaining subtraction artifacts and suggest that given the complexity of these artifact origins, a convolution kernel with a set of flexible bases with spatial variation may be needed to yield further improvements.

This paper presents a fully multidimensional kernel-based reconstruction scheme for finite volume methods applied to systems of hyperbolic conservation laws, with a particular emphasis on the compressible Euler equations. Nonoscillatory reconstruction is achieved through an adaptive-order weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO) method cast into a form suited to multidimensional reconstruction. A kernel-based approach inspired by radial basis functions and Gaussian process modeling, which we call kernel-based finite volume method with WENO, is presented here. This approach allows the creation of a scheme of arbitrary order of accuracy with simply defined multidimensional stencils and substencils. Furthermore, the fully multidimensional nature of the reconstruction allows for a more straightforward extension to higher spatial dimensions and removes the need for complicated boundary conditions on intermediate quantities in modified dimension-by-dimension methods. In addition, a new simple yet effective set of reconstruction variables is introduced, which could be useful in existing schemes with little modification. The proposed scheme is applied to a suite of stringent and informative benchmark problems to demonstrate its efficacy and utility. A highly parallel multi-GPU implementation using Kokkos and the message-passing interface is also provided.

总结: 
文章提出了太阳色球中太阳耀斑形成的物理机制，分为三个阶段生命周期。第一阶段，在色球底部形成密度波动，随着时间逐渐向上加速，进入过渡区后加速增加，在进入日冕区时减速至零。文章还分析了等离子体密度和速度随时间和空间的变化，以及重力对太阳色球中物质运动的影响。 <div>
The physical mechanism for the creation of solar spicules is proposed with three stages of their life cycle. It is assumed that at stage I the density hump is formed locally in the x-y plane in the lower chromosphere in the presence of temperature gradients of electrons and ions along the z-axis (the vertical direction). In this region, the density structure of quasi-neutral (ni ≃ ne = n) plasma after taking birth is accelerated in the vertical direction owing to the thermal force Fth ∝ ∇n(x, y, t) × (∇Te + ∇Ti). The exact time-dependent analytical solution of two-fluid plasma equations is presented assuming that density is maximum at the center of the density structure and decays away from it gradually. The 2D density structure is created as a step function H(t) in time at the bottom of the chromosphere, and consequently, the vertical plasma velocity turns out to be the ramp function of time R(t) = tH(t), whereas the source term S(x, y, t) for the density follows the delta function δ(t) form. The upward acceleration produced in this density structure is greater than the downward constant solar acceleration −g⊙ in the chromosphere. In the transition region, the temperature gradients are steeper; therefore, the upward acceleration increases in magnitude g⊙ ≪ a and the density hump spends less time there. This is stage II of its life cycle. In stage III, the density structure enters into the corona, where the gradients of temperatures vanish and the structure decelerates to zero velocity under the action of the solar gravitational force.

Although the study of X-ray binaries has led to major breakthroughs in high-energy astrophysics, their circumbinary environment at scales of ∼100–10,000 au has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we undertake a novel and exploratory study by employing direct and high-contrast imaging techniques on a sample of X-ray binaries, using adaptive optics and the vortex coronagraph on Keck/NIRC2. High-contrast imaging opens up the possibility to search for exoplanets, brown dwarfs, circumbinary companion stars, and protoplanetary disks in these extreme systems. Here we present the first near-infrared high-contrast images of 13 high-mass X-ray binaries located within ∼2–3 kpc. The key results of this campaign involve the discovery of several candidate circumbinary companions ranging from substellar (brown dwarf) to stellar masses. By conducting an analysis based on Galactic population models, we discriminate sources that are likely background/foreground stars and isolate those that have a high probability (≳60%–99%) of being gravitationally bound to the X-ray binary. This paper seeks to establish a preliminary catalog for future analyses of proper motion and subsequent observations. With our preliminary results, we calculate the first estimate of the companion frequency and the multiplicity frequency for X-ray binaries: ≈0.6 and 1.8 ± 0.9, respectively, considering only the sources that are most likely bound to the X-ray binary. In addition to extending our comprehension of how brown dwarfs and stars can form and survive in such extreme systems, our study opens a new window to our understanding of the formation of X-ray binaries.

<div> Jupiter, metal-poor, enrichment, radiative layer, accretion<br />
<br />总结: 木星的形成和结构模型预测了一个贫金属的外层，这与Galileo探测器测得的两到三倍太阳金属丰度不符。同时，Juno的数据表明水和氨的丰度增加。研究者通过探讨木星是否可能存在一个深层辐射层来解决这一矛盾。结果显示，在木星演化过程中的重元素吸积可以导致大气层的富集，这种结构能够在数十亿年内保持稳定。重元素的来源可能是累积的小撞击或一次大的撞击。这个富集的偏好情景需要一个深层辐射区，并且通过与分子扩散类似的效率进行边界的垂直混合。因此，木星的大部分分子外壳可能具有太阳的组成，而其最上层大气富含较重元素，这种富集可能来自固体物体的吸积。这种可能性解决了木星内部模型和大气成分测量之间长期存在的不匹配。此外，研究还调查了富集是否可能是由于稀释核心的侵蚀，结果表明这种可能性极低。这个侵蚀核心的情景与演化计算、深层辐射层和已发表的内部模型不一致。 <div>
Updated formation and structure models of Jupiter predict a metal-poor envelope. This is at odds with the two to three times solar metallicity measured by the Galileo probe. Additionally, Juno data imply that water and ammonia are enriched. Here, we explore whether Jupiter could have a deep radiative layer separating the atmosphere from the deeper interior. The radiative layer could be caused by a hydrogen-transparency window or depletion of alkali metals. We show that heavy-element accretion during Jupiter’s evolution could lead to the desired atmospheric enrichment and that this configuration would be stable over billions of years. The origin of the heavy elements could be cumulative small impacts or one large impact. The preferred scenario requires a deep radiative zone, due to a local reduction of the opacity at ∼2000 K by ∼90%, which is supported by Juno data, and vertical mixing through the boundary with an efficiency similar to that of molecular diffusion (D ≲ 10−2 cm2 s−1). Therefore, most of Jupiter’s molecular envelope could have solar composition while its uppermost atmosphere is enriched with heavier elements. The enrichment likely originates from the accretion of solid objects. This possibility resolves the long-standing mismatch between Jupiter’s interior models and atmospheric composition measurements. Furthermore, our results imply that the measured atmospheric composition of exoplanets does not necessarily reflect their bulk compositions. We also investigate whether the enrichment could be due to the erosion of a dilute core and show that this is highly unlikely. The core-erosion scenario is inconsistent with evolution calculations, the deep radiative layer, and published interior models.

<div> Gaia Data Release 3, red giant stars, chemodynamical properties, Vϕ–[Fe/H] maps, bar-like kinematics<br />Merger-induced Splash, comparison with Auriga simulation, formation of bar, evolution of classical bulge<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用盖亚第三版数据中的红巨星，探讨了银河系在方位速度Vϕ和金属丰度[Fe/H]空间中的化学动力学特性。研究发现了从星系核到外盘的行星Vϕ–[Fe/H]图的一致序列，清晰展现了薄盘/厚盘和Splash的特征。金属丰度较高的恒星显示出类似条状结构的动力学特性，而金属丰度较低的恒星则显示出以色散为主导的动力学特性。在中等金属丰度（−1 < [Fe/H]< − 0.4）范围内可以分为两种类型，一种类似于条状结构，即动力学冷（km s−1）且快速旋转（Vϕ ≳ 100 km s−1），另一种是Splash，动力学热（km s−1）且缓慢旋转（Vϕ ≲ 100 km s−1）。通过与Auriga模拟的比较发现，只有在大约10亿年前发生的最后一次主要合并事件周围诞生的恒星在Vϕ–[Fe/H]空间中展现出类似Splash的特征，这意味着Splash很可能是由合并引起的，主要由受加热的盘星和与最后一次主要合并相关的星爆形成。Splash是由原始盘形成的，其较低的金属丰度限制与厚盘相吻合。条状结构形成于金属丰度> −1 dex的动力学热盘，Splash不参与条状结构的形成和增长。此外，我们通过一系列孤立演化的N体盘模拟验证了经典星系核可以被条状结构旋转并发展出柱状旋转的情况，与金属丰度较低的恒星的观测结果一致。 <br /> <div>
We explore the chemodynamical properties of the Galaxy in the azimuthal velocity Vϕ and metallicity [Fe/H] space using red giant stars from Gaia Data Release 3. The row-normalized Vϕ–[Fe/H] maps form a coherent sequence from the bulge to the outer disk, clearly revealing the thin/thick disk and the Splash. The metal-rich stars display bar-like kinematics, while the metal-poor stars show dispersion-dominated kinematics. The intermediate-metallicity population (−1 < [Fe/H]< − 0.4) can be separated into two populations, one that is bar-like, i.e., dynamically cold ( km s−1) and fast-rotating (Vϕ ≳ 100 km s−1), and the Splash, which is dynamically hot ( km s−1) and slow-rotating (Vϕ ≲ 100 km s−1). We compare the observations in the bulge region with an Auriga simulation where the last major merger event occurred ∼10 Gyr ago: only stars born around the time of the merger reveal a Splash-like feature in the Vϕ–[Fe/H] space, suggesting that the Splash is likely merger-induced, predominantly made up of heated disk stars and the starburst associated with the last major merger. Since the Splash formed from the proto-disk, its lower metallicity limit coincides with that of the thick disk. The bar formed later from the dynamically hot disk with [Fe/H] > − 1 dex, with the Splash not participating in the bar formation and growth. Moreover, with a set of isolated evolving N-body disk simulations, we confirm that a nonrotating classical bulge can be spun up by the bar and develop cylindrical rotation, consistent with the observations for the metal-poor stars.

<title>Dynamical Properties of Magnetized Low-angular-momentum Accretion Flows around a Kerr Black Hole</title>

<div> 关键词: 角动量，吸积流，磁流体动力学，Kerr黑洞，Sgr A*<br />
总结: 这篇文章讨论了吸积流的角动量对其特性的影响，研究发现吸积流的角动量决定了其解的类型，通过数值模拟发现在Kerr黑洞周围，角动量较低的吸积流显示出与高或者非常低角动量吸积流显著不同的性质，而中等范围的角动量吸积流在黑洞附近具有最高的密度、压力和温度，并且具有非对称性质，这对观测Sgr A*超大质量黑洞的复杂特征提供了可能的解释。另外，随着角动量的减小，音速面也会远离最内稳定圆轨道。总结: <br /> <div>
An essential factor for determining the characteristics of an accretion flow is its angular momentum. According to the angular momentum of the flow, semi-analytical analysis suggests various types of accretion solutions. It is critical to test these with numerical simulations, using the most advanced framework available (general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics), to understand how the flow changes with different angular momentum. By changing the initial condition of the accretion torus minimally, we can simulate a steady, low-angular-momentum accretion flow around a Kerr black hole. We focus primarily on the lower limits of angular momentum and find that an accretion flow with an intermediate range of angular momentum differs significantly from high- or very-low-angular-momentum flows. The intermediate-angular-momentum accretion flow has the highest density, pressure, and temperature near the black hole, making it easier to observe. We find that the density and pressure have power-law scalings ρ ∝ rn−3/2 and pg ∝ rn−5/2, which only hold for very-low-angular-momentum cases. With the increase in flow angular momentum, it develops a nonaxisymmetric nature. In this case, simple self-similarity does not hold. We also find that the sonic surface moves away from the innermost stable circular orbit as the angular momentum decreases. Finally, we emphasize that an intermediate-angular-momentum flow could provide a possible solution to explaining the complex observation features of the supermassive black hole Sgr A* at our galactic center.

<div> slim disk, radiative flux, specific energy, black hole, relativistic jets
<br /><br />总结:
研究了从纤细盘中喷射出相对论性喷流的机制。在纤细盘中，辐射压力占主导地位，辐射能量沿垂直方向的压力梯度流动。辐射通量的散度告诉我们，从近赤道平面的底层流向上边界面上方的另一层的辐射能量流被吸收。吸收的能量随着物质向内移动而在上层累积，计算表明，当通过上层的流量相对较低时，上层流的比能量在黑洞附近可以达到∼c2。由于比能量∼c2远远大于引力能量，当几乎所有角动量被移除后，上层的最内部部分的高度可能显着增加。因此，上层的最内部部分在几乎所有角动量被移除后的高度可能远远大于黑洞的大小，并且流动可能会在盘的中央轴周围相互碰撞，从轴向反弹，同时沿着轴向扩展。预计流动沿着中央轴向外流，并由于其横截面的改变而变得超音速，最终产生相对论性喷流。 <div>
A mechanism for the ejection of relativistic jets from slim disks is studied. Since radiation pressure is dominant in the slim disk, radiative energy flows along the pressure gradient in the vertical direction. The divergence of the radiative flux tells us that the flow of radiative energy from a bottom layer near the equatorial plane is absorbed by another layer above the boundary surface. The absorbed energy accumulates in the upper layer as the matter advances inward, and calculations show that the specific energy of the flow in the upper layer can be as large as ∼c2 near the black hole when the accretion rate through the upper layer is relatively low. Since the specific energy ∼c2 is much larger than the gravitational energy, the height of the upper layer could significantly increase then. Hence, the innermost part of the upper layer after almost all the angular momentum has been removed could have a much greater height than the size of the black hole, and the flow could collide with itself around the central axis of the disk, bouncing back from the axis while simultaneously expanding along it. The flow is expected to go outward along the central axis and to become supersonic due to the change in its cross section, finally producing relativistic jets.

本文通过马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛的Metropolis算法对不同类型的振荡暗能量(DE)模型进行了比较研究。文中考察了八种不同的振荡参数化模型，这些模型已经表现出相当的能力来适应整体宇宙观测，包括Ia型超新星Pantheon样本、宇宙学原初黑体辐射的距离先验等。作者使用了Akaike信息准则和偏差信息准则来比较这些模型与观测数据的一致性。结果表明，这些模型能够解决宇宙巧合问题并缓解哈勃张力。此外，文中还讨论了根据SHoES的测量结果对模型进行修正得到的Hubble常数值的变化。  <div>
In this paper, we have performed a comparative study of different types of oscillating dark energy (DE) models using the Metropolis algorithm of Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Eight different oscillating parameterizations are examined herein that have demonstrated considerable ability to fit the overall cosmological observations, including the Pantheon sample of Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, cosmic chronometer Hubble data, and distance priors of the Planck cosmic microwave background. In order to compare the consistency of these models with observations, we have used both the Akaike and deviance information criteria. Although the values of the Akaike information criterion for different models indicate that there is no support for oscillating DE models, the deviance information criterion showed that there is significant support for some of these models. Our results showed that these models are capable of solving the cosmic coincidence problem and alleviating the Hubble tension. Comparing the H0 values obtained for different oscillating scenarios with that of ΛCDM, we observed that our oscillating models led to , which is 0.29 greater than H0,Λ and thus reduces the Hubble tension. Among all of the models, model 1, with H0 = 70.00 ± 0.71, is the most capable of alleviating the H0 tension. Furthermore, we examined our models assuming H0 = 73.0 ± 1.4 from SHoES measurements. We find that adding this data point to our data combination led to a increase in the H0 value for different models.

总结：<br /><br /> 近期研究发现在水星轨道附近添加额外的胚胎可以更成功地形成类似水星的天体。研究目的是通过模拟太阳系的形成过程，并考虑巨大行星木星和土星的存在来形成水星。研究发现，在模拟过程中，具有核质量分数（CMFs）大于0.4的水星类似物在约10％的模拟中形成，两倍于此数目的水星类似物在形成过程中不稳定并未持续到模拟结束。大部分水星类似物的CMFs低于水星的0.7，这是由于显著的碎片物质吸积所致。研究建议需要更深入地了解碎片物质在碰撞磨粒过程中的流失比例，以便更好地理解水星的形成过程，或者需要其他机制来阻止这些碎片物质的吸积。 <div>
Mercury is notoriously difficult to form in Solar System simulations, due to its small mass and iron-rich composition. Smooth particle hydrodynamics simulations of collisions have found that a Mercury-like body could be formed by one or multiple giant impacts, but due to the chaotic nature of collisions, it is difficult to create a scenario where such impacts will take place. Recent work has found more success forming Mercury analogues by adding additional embryos near Mercury’s orbit. In this work, we aim to form Mercury by simulating the formation of the Solar System in the presence of the giant planets Jupiter and Saturn. We test out the effect of an inner disk of embryos added on to the commonly used narrow annulus of initial material. We form Mercury analogues with core-mass fractions (CMFs) > 0.4 in ∼10% of our simulations, and twice that number of Mercury analogues form during the formation process but are unstable and do not last to the end of the simulations. Mercury analogues form at similar rates for both disks with and without an inner component, and most of our Mercury analogues have lower CMFs than that of Mercury, ∼0.7, due to significant accretion of debris material. We suggest that a more in-depth understanding of the fraction of debris mass that is lost to collisional grinding is necessary to understand Mercury’s formation, or some additional mechanism is required to stop this debris from accreting.

<div> 关键词: H-poor Type I超明亮超新星, W形O ii线, 合成光谱, 温度, 非热电离率<br />
<br />总结:
本研究通过系统计算合成光谱，重现了八颗H-poor Type I超明亮超新星的观测光谱。研究发现，W形O ii线的形成对温度敏感，需要在T ∼ 14,000–16,000 K的范围内才能产生而不需要大的偏离。而W形O ii线的出现对于非热电离率也有约束作用，可以为SLSNe I的能量来源提供独立的约束。因此，SLSNe I的光谱特征可以通过非热电离率对能量来源进行独立约束。 <div>
H-poor Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe I) are characterized by O ii lines around 4000–4500 Å in pre-/near-maximum spectra, the so-called W-shaped O ii lines. As these lines are from relatively high excitation levels, they have been considered a sign of nonthermal processes, which may provide a hint of the power sources of SLSNe I. However, the conditions for these lines to appear have not been well understood. In this work, we systematically calculate synthetic spectra to reproduce the observed spectra of eight SLSNe I, parameterizing departure coefficients from the nebular approximation in the supernova ejecta (expressed as bneb). We find that most of the observed spectra can be well reproduced with bneb ≲ 10, which means that no strong departure is necessary for the formation of the W-shaped O ii lines. We also show that the appearance of the W-shaped O ii lines is sensitive to temperature; only spectra with temperatures in the range of T ∼ 14,000–16,000 K can produce the W-shaped O ii lines without large departures. Based on this, we constrain the nonthermal ionization rate near the photosphere. Our results suggest that spectral features of SLSNe I can give independent constraints on the power source through the nonthermal ionization rates.

We report high angular resolution observations, made with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array in band 6, of high excitation molecular lines of and SO2 and of the H29α radio recombination line toward the G345.0061+01.794 B HC H ii region in order to investigate the physical and kinematical characteristics of its surroundings. Emission was detected in all observed components of the J = 14 →13 rotational ladder of and in the 304,26–303,27, and 324,28–323,29 lines of SO2. The peak of the velocity-integrated molecular emission is located ∼0.″4 northwest of the peak of the continuum emission. The first-order moment images and channel maps show a velocity gradient of 1.1 km s−1 arcsec−1 across the source and a distinctive spot of blueshifted emission toward the peak of the zero-order moment. The rotational temperature is found to decrease from 252±24 K at the peak position to 166±16 K at its edge, indicating that our molecular observations are probing a hot molecular core that is internally excited. The emission in the H29α line arises from a region of 0.″65 in size, where its peak coincides with that of the dust continuum. We model the kinematical characteristics of the “central blue spot” feature as due to infalling motions, suggesting a central mass of 172.8±8.8 M⊙. Our observations indicate that this HC H ii region is surrounded by a compact structure of hot molecular gas, which is rotating and infalling toward a central mass, that is most likely confining the ionized region. The observed scenario is reminiscent of a “butterfly pattern” with an approximately edge-on torus and ionized gas roughly parallel to its rotation axis.

<title>Optical Photometric Indicators of Galaxy Cluster Relaxation</title>

The most dynamically relaxed clusters of galaxies play a special role in cosmological studies as well as astrophysical studies of the intracluster medium (ICM) and active galactic nucleus feedback. While high-spatial-resolution imaging of the morphology of the ICM has long been the gold standard for establishing a cluster’s dynamical state, such data are not available from current or planned surveys, and thus require separate, pointed follow-up observations. With optical and/or near-IR photometric imaging, and red-sequence cluster finding results from those data, expected to be ubiquitously available for clusters discovered in upcoming optical and millimeter-wavelength surveys, it is worth asking how effectively photometric data alone can identify relaxed cluster candidates, before investing in, e.g., high-resolution X-ray observations. Here we assess the ability of several simple photometric measurements, based on the redMaPPer cluster finder run on Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, to reproduce X-ray classifications of dynamical state for an X-ray selected sample of massive clusters. We find that two simple metrics contrasting the bright central galaxy (BCG) to other cluster members can identify a complete sample of relaxed clusters with a purity of ∼40% in our data set. Including minimal ICM information in the form of a center position increases the purity to ∼60%. However, all three metrics depend critically on correctly identifying the BCG, which is presently a challenge for optical red-sequence cluster finders.

The blue supergiant (BSG) problem, namely, the overabundance of BSGs inconsistent with classical stellar evolution theory, remains an open question in stellar astrophysics. Several theoretical explanations have been proposed, which may be tested by their predictions for the characteristic time variability. In this work, we analyze the light curves of a sample of 20 BSGs obtained from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission. We report a characteristic signal in the low-frequency (f ≲ 2 day−1) range for all our targets. The amplitude spectrum has a peak frequency of ∼0.2 day−1, and we are able to fit it by a modified Lorentzian profile. The signal itself shows strong stochasticity across different TESS sectors, suggesting its driving mechanism happens on short (≲months) timescales. Our signals resemble those obtained for a limited sample of hotter OB stars and yellow supergiants, suggesting their possible common origins. We discuss three possible physical explanations: stellar winds launched by rotation, convection motions that reach the stellar surface, and waves from the deep stellar interior. The peak frequency of the signal favors processes related to the convective zone caused by the iron opacity peak, and the shape of the spectra might be explained by the propagation of high-order, damped gravity waves excited from that zone. We discuss the uncertainties and limitations of all these scenarios.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用Submillimeter Array在230 GHz处对仙女座星系(M31)中的巨型分子云(GMC)进行了深入的干涉观测，以研究其物理特性。作者利用12CO和13CO的发射来推导162个空间分辨的GMC的质量、大小和速度离散度，并对其中的117个具有单分量线型的GMC进行了详细研究。在对这些GMC的Larson关系进行检验后，得出以下结论：一是在12CO和13CO发射中都存在高度相关的质量-大小关系；二是12CO线宽-大小（LWS）关系较弱，而13CO LWS关系几乎不存在，这表明LWS关系可能与空间尺度有关；三是只有43%的GMCs是由引力约束的。研究者根据13CO发射的强度和范围将GMCs分为了两类，发现强13CO发射的GMC中大部分（73%）都是由引力约束的，而弱13CO发射的GMC中只有25%是由引力约束的。最后，研究发现M31的GMC的物理特性在许多方面与本地系的银河云非常相似。 <div>
Deep interferometric observations of CO and dust continuum emission are obtained with the Submillimeter Array at 230 GHz to investigate the physical nature of the giant molecular cloud (GMC) population in the Andromeda galaxy (M31). We use J = 2 − 1 12CO and 13CO emission to derive the masses, sizes, and velocity dispersions of 162 spatially resolved GMCs. We perform a detailed study of a subset of 117 GMCs that exhibit simple, single-component line profile shapes. Examining the Larson scaling relations for these GMCs, we find (1) a highly correlated mass–size relation in both 12CO and 13CO emission; (2) a weakly correlated 12CO line width–size (LWS) relation along with a weaker, almost nonexistent, 13CO LWS relation, suggesting a possible dependence of the LWS relation on spatial scale; and (3) that only 43% of these GMCs are gravitationally bound. We identify two classes of GMCs based on the strength and extent of their 13CO emission. Examination of the Larson relations finds that both classes are individually characterized by strong 12CO mass–size relations and much weaker 12CO and 13CO LWS relations. The majority (73%) of strong 13CO-emitting GMCs are found to be gravitationally bound. However, only 25% of the weak 13CO-emitting GMCs are bound. The resulting breakdown in the Larson relations in the weak 13CO-emitting population decouples the mass–size and LWS relations, demonstrating that independent physical causes are required to understand the origin of each. Finally, in nearly every aspect, the physical properties of the M31 GMCs are found to be very similar to those of local Milky Way clouds.

总结:
本文报告了对1A 1744−361的高强度突发进行了为期三个月的监测。文章利用X射线和射电数据对其进行了时序和光谱分析。X射线硬度-强度和色度图表明1A 1744−361在大部分突发期间处于环礁态，但在突发高峰时表现出类似Z态的特性。在NICER数据的时序分析中发现了约8赫兹的准周期振荡，并将其与Z态中的正常支QPOs联系起来。MeerKAT的射电监测数据显示，源在突发高峰期间射电最亮，并在突发发生约3天后从“岛屿”谱态过渡到“香蕉”谱态，同时产生了瞬发射流物质。文章还报道了源的X射线吸收线特征，可能来自吸积盘大气层。这些观测结果提供了关于低质量吸积率（环礁态）时源发生射电耀斑和射流物质的强有力证据。 <div>
We report on X-ray (NICER/NuSTAR/MAXI/Swift) and radio (MeerKAT) timing and spectroscopic analysis from a 3 month monitoring campaign in 2022 of a high-intensity outburst of the dipping neutron star low-mass X-ray binary 1A 1744−361. The 0.5–6.8 keV NICER X-ray hardness–intensity and color–color diagrams of the observations throughout the outburst suggest that 1A 1744−361 spent most of its outburst in an atoll-state, but we show that the source exhibited Z-state-like properties at the peak of the outburst, similar to a small sample of other atoll-state sources. A timing analysis with NICER data revealed several instances of an ≈8 Hz quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO; fractional rms amplitudes of ∼5%) around the peak of the outburst, the first from this source, which we connect to the normal branch QPOs seen in the Z-state. Our observations of 1A 1744−361 are fully consistent with the idea of the mass accretion rate being the main distinguishing parameter between atoll- and Z-states. Radio monitoring data by MeerKAT suggests that the source was at its radio-brightest during the outburst peak, and that the source transitioned from the “island” spectral state to the “banana” state within ∼3 days of the outburst onset, launching transient jet ejecta. The observations present the strongest evidence for radio flaring, including jet ejecta, during the island-to-banana spectral state transition at low accretion rates (atoll-state). The source also exhibited Fe xxv, Fe xxvi Kα, and Kβ X-ray absorption lines, whose origins likely lie in an accretion disk atmosphere.

这篇文章介绍了一项针对澳大利亚深空能源调查中的活跃星系核/类星体光谱的全南天天空的Mg iiλλ2796，2803双线吸收体的调查。调查覆盖了红移为0.33≤z≤2.19范围内656个Mg ii吸收系统，其当量宽度为0.3≤Wr(2796)≤ 3.45 Å。通过Monte Carlo模型计算得出Mg ii质量密度ΩMg II ∼ 5 × 10−7，且在跨越约7亿年的时间跨度后没有证据表明其演变。这个模型还可以利用大型低分辨率调查的效率，仅需要来自昂贵高分辨率调查的少量样本。 <div>
We present an all-southern sky survey for Mg iiλλ2796, 2803 doublet absorbers in 951 z < 4 active galactic nucleus/quasar spectra from the Australian Dark Energy Survey. The spectral resolution ranges from R = 1400 to 1700 over the wavelengths 3700–8800 Å. The survey has a 5σ detection completeness of 50% and above for rest-frame equivalent widths Wr(2796) ≥ 0.3 Å. We studied 656 Mg ii absorption systems over the redshift range 0.33 ≤ z ≤ 2.19 with equivalent widths 0.3 ≤ Wr(2796) ≤ 3.45 Å. The equivalent width distribution is well fit by an exponential function with W* = 0.76 ± 0.04 Å, and the redshift path density exhibits very little evolution. Overall, our findings are consistent with the large, predominantly northern sky, surveys of Mg ii absorbers. We developed and implemented a Monte Carlo model informed by a high-resolution Mg ii survey for determining the Mg ii mass density, ΩMg II. We found ΩMg II ∼ 5 × 10−7 with no evidence of evolution over a ∼7 Gyr time span following Cosmic Noon. Incorporating measurements covering 2.0 ≤ z ≤ 6.4 from the literature, we extended our insights into Mg ii mass density evolution from the end of reionization well past the Cosmic Noon epoch. The presented Monte Carlo model has potential for advancing our knowledge of the evolution of mass densities of metal ions common to quasar absorption line studies, as it exploits the efficiency of large low-resolution surveys while requiring only small samples from expensive high-resolution surveys.

M 矮星、广泛对流、快速旋转、宽双星、自转减速。

- M矮星在旋转和磁活跃性上有明显的质量依赖关系，经历了快速旋转到减速的转变。
- 使用Gaia识别了67个广泛分离的M矮星双星系统，并对它们的Hα特征进行了测量和分类。
- 研究结果表明，这些双星系统的自转减速主要由质量决定，其次是其他因素的影响。
- 结果还显示出宽双星群体由于动力作用而随时间分散。
- 之前对于给定质量的场星自转减速时代的大分散可能源于出生环境的差异，以及适度的内在随机性。

<br /><br />总结: <br />本文研究了M 矮星双星系统的自转和磁活跃性，发现其自转减速主要由质量决定，其次是其他因素的影响。研究结果还显示出宽双星群体由于动力作用而随时间分散。这一发现对于我们理解恒星自转和磁活跃性的演化过程具有重要意义。 <div>
Fully convective M dwarfs typically remain rapidly rotating and magnetically active for billions of years, followed by an abrupt and mass-dependent transition to slow rotation and quiescence. A robust understanding of this process is complicated by difficulties in estimating M dwarf ages and potential dependencies on other variables such as birth environment or metallicity. To isolate the effect of mass, we consider M dwarfs in wide binaries. We identify 67 widely separated, fully convective (0.08–0.35 M⊙) M dwarf binary systems using Gaia and measure the Hα feature for each component. We classify the pairs into three categories: systems where both components are active, systems where both are inactive, and candidate transition systems, where one component is active and the other inactive. We gather higher-resolution spectra of the candidate transition systems to verify that their behavior does not result from an unresolved third component, yielding one new triple with surprising activity levels. Neglecting this triple, we find 22 active, 36 inactive, and eight transition pairs. Our results are consistent with the epoch of spindown for these binaries being primarily determined by mass, with mild second-order effects; we place a 1σ upper limit of 0.5 Gyr or 25% on the dispersion in the mass-dependent spindown relation. Our findings suggest that the large dispersion in the spindown epoch previously observed for field stars of a given mass may stem from differences in birth environment, in addition to modest intrinsic stochasticity. We also see evidence that the wide binary population is dispersed over time due to dynamical processing.

<div> 磁场，气体动力学，银河系，辐射冷却，热平衡
<br /><br />总结:
通过三维模拟和辐射冷却和加热的研究，我们发现在银河系的球状星系核区域，磁场对气体动力学起着重要作用。当太阳系核区域附近的温度遵循辐射冷却和加热的热平衡曲线时，形成了高温的等离子气体，并在中平面附近形成低温气体。尽管星际气体的热能通过辐射冷却减少，但磁场强度的饱和水平并不明显受到辐射冷却和加热的影响。平均磁场强度增至10μG，并在局部达到数百微高斯。我们发现在具有辐射冷却和加热的情况下，在中纬度形成了磁场主导的区域，而在没有辐射效应的情况下则没有。这些中纬度区域的垂直厚度为50-150pc，径向位置在0.4-0.8kpc，与中性原子气体的观测垂直分布相当。当对银河系球状星系核区域不同能量密度组分进行平均时，磁能与热能相当。因此，我们得出结论，磁场在控制银河系球状星系核区域的动力和热特性方面发挥了重要作用。 <div>
We investigate the role of magnetic field on the gas dynamics in a galactic bulge region by three-dimensional simulations with radiative cooling and heating. While a high-temperature corona with T > 106 K is formed in the halo regions, the temperature near the midplane is ≲104 K following the thermal equilibrium curve determined by the radiative cooling and heating. Although the thermal energy of the interstellar gas is lost by radiative cooling, the saturation level of the magnetic field strength does not significantly depend on the radiative cooling and heating. The magnetic field strength is amplified to 10 μG on average and reaches several hundred microgauss locally. We find the formation of magnetically dominated regions at midlatitudes in the case with the radiative cooling and heating, which is not seen in the case without radiative effect. The vertical thickness of the midlatitude regions is 50–150 pc at the radial location of 0.4–0.8 kpc from the Galactic center, which is comparable to the observed vertical distribution of neutral atomic gas. When we take the average of different components of energy density integrated over the galactic bulge region, the magnetic energy is comparable to the thermal energy. We conclude that the magnetic field plays a substantial role in controlling the dynamical and thermal properties of the galactic bulge region.

<div> AGNs, JWST, SMILES, MIRI, 遮挡
总结:
JWST和SMILES项目取得了重要进展，通过MIRI检测到的3273个源的光谱能量分布（SED）分析，发现了217个AGN候选体，其中包括主要样本111个普通大质量星系中的AGN，86个低质量星系中的AGN候选体，以及20个高红移的AGN候选体。80%的MIRI选定的AGN候选体是新的发现，尤其是在质量较大的星系中，34%的MIRI AGN鉴定是新的，突显了遮挡对先前选择的影响。另外，对不同波长的观测结果进行汇总后，构建了迄今最完整的AGN样本，并研究了不同选择技术的相对表现。AGN遮挡比例从LAGN,bol ∼ 1010L⊙增加到1011L⊙，然后随着较高的亮度而下降。此外，受遮挡的AGN比例从z ∼ 0逐渐增加到z ∼ 4，大多数高红移的AGN受到遮挡。我们讨论了AGN的遮挡、固有SED变化、星系污染、调查深度和选择技术如何复杂化了完整的AGN样本的构建。 <div>
Understanding the coevolution of supermassive black holes and their host systems requires a comprehensive census of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) behavior across a wide range of redshift, luminosity, obscuration level, and galaxy properties. We report significant progress with JWST toward this goal from the Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES). Based on comprehensive spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis of 3273 MIRI-detected sources, we identify 217 AGN candidates over a survey area of ∼34 arcmin2, including a primary sample of 111 AGNs in normal massive galaxies (M* > 109.5M☉) at z ∼ 0–4, an extended sample of 86 AGN candidates in low-mass galaxies (M* < 109.5M☉), and a high-z sample of 20 AGN candidates at z ∼ 4–8.4. Notably, about 80% of our MIRI-selected AGN candidates are new discoveries despite the extensive pre-JWST AGN searches. Even among the massive galaxies where the previous AGN search is believed to be thorough, 34% of the MIRI AGN identifications are new, highlighting the impact of obscuration on previous selections. By combining our results with the efforts at other wavelengths, we build the most complete AGN sample to date and examine the relative performance of different selection techniques. We find the obscured AGN fraction increases from LAGN,bol ∼ 1010L⊙ to 1011L⊙ and then drops toward higher luminosity. Additionally, the obscured AGN fraction gradually increases from z ∼ 0 to z ∼ 4 with most high-z AGNs obscured. We discuss how AGN obscuration, intrinsic SED variations, galaxy contamination, survey depth, and selection techniques complicate the construction of a complete AGN sample.

研究发现星际湍流速度与局部星形成率表面密度之间存在相关性。分子气体的局部速度离散度随着星形成率表面密度的增加而增加，但维里参数大致保持不变，表明分子气体仍然是自引力的。这种相关性是由于速度离散度取决于分子表面密度和物体云的质量，而星形成率表面密度随着这些量的增加而增加。此外，压力波动也受到了研究。分子的压力的方位变化与星际湍流率的关联比预期的要弱一些，这表明螺旋臂中分子的星形成效率有轻微提高。总体而言，动态平衡压力和星形成率有很好的相关性，提示这种相关性可能是星形成的前兆，而不是一种反应。最后，研究结果表明，反馈和银河动力学过程都扮演着重要的角色。 <br /><br />总结: 研究发现星际湍流速度与局部星形成率表面密度存在相关性；分子气体的局部速度离散度随着星形成率表面密度的增加而增加，但维里参数保持不变；压力波动也受到了研究，表明螺旋臂中分子的星形成效率有所提高；动态平衡压力和星形成率有很好的相关性；最后，研究结果表明，反馈和银河动力学过程都扮演着重要的角色。 <div>
The correlation between interstellar turbulent speed and local star formation rate surface density, ΣSFR, is studied using CO observations in the PHANGS survey. The local velocity dispersion of molecular gas, σ, increases with ΣSFR, but the virial parameter, αvir, is about constant, suggesting the molecular gas remains self-gravitating. The correlation arises because σ depends on the molecular surface density, Σmol, and object cloud mass, Mmol, with the usual molecular cloud correlations, while ΣSFR increases with both of these quantities because of a nearly constant star formation efficiency for CO. Pressure fluctuations with ΔΣSFR are also examined. Azimuthal variations of molecular pressure, ΔPmol, have a weaker correlation with ΔΣSFR than expected from the power-law correlation between the total quantities, suggesting slightly enhanced star formation rate (SFR) efficiency per molecule in spiral arms. Dynamical equilibrium pressure and SFR correlate well for the whole sample, as , which is steeper than in other studies. The azimuthal fluctuations, ΔPDE(ΔΣSFR), follow the total correlation PDE(ΣSFR) closely, hinting that some of this correlation may be a precursor to star formation, rather than a reaction. Galactic dynamical processes correlate linearly such that for total gas surface density Σgas and galactic dynamical rates, R, equal to κ, A, or Ω, representing epicyclic frequency, shear rate A, and orbit rate Ω. These results suggest important roles for both feedback and galactic dynamics.

Supernova (SN) 1987A offers a unique opportunity to study how a spatially resolved SN evolves into a young SN remnant. We present and analyze Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging observations of SN 1987A obtained in 2022 and compare them with HST observations from 2009 to 2021. These observations allow us to follow the evolution of the equatorial ring (ER), the rapidly expanding ejecta, and emission from the center over a wide range in wavelength from 2000 to 11,000 Å. The ER has continued to fade since it reached its maximum ∼8200 days after the explosion. In contrast, the ejecta brightened until day ∼11,000 before their emission levelled off; the west side brightened more than the east side, which we attribute to the stronger X-ray emission by the ER on that side. The asymmetric ejecta expand homologously in all filters, which are dominated by various emission lines from hydrogen, calcium, and iron. From this overall similarity, we infer the ejecta are chemically well mixed on large scales. The exception is the diffuse morphology observed in the UV filters dominated by emission from the Mg ii resonance lines that get scattered before escaping. The 2022 observations do not show any sign of the compact object that was inferred from highly ionized emission near the remnant’s center observed with JWST. We determine an upper limit on the flux from a compact central source in the [O iii] HST image. The nondetection of this line indicates that the S and Ar lines observed with JWST originate from the O free inner Si–S–Ar-rich zone and/or that the observed [O iii] flux is strongly affected by dust scattering.

总结: 
本研究使用Keck Heavy Metal Survey的数据，对19个大质量恒定星系进行了研究。研究发现这些星系的铁丰度在z∼1.4和z∼2.1时期分别为[Fe/H] = −0.5至−0.1 dex和−0.2 [−0.3] dex，镁铁比值分别为[Mg/Fe] = 0.1–0.6 dex和0.3 [0.5] dex。星系的形成红移为zform = 2–8，并且化学丰度随着时间推移而下降，表明它们在更早的时期形成并且星体形成时间较短。天体合并和中心星体形成可能是形成这些星系的机制。 这些发现对我们理解宇宙中恒定星系的演化提供了重要线索。 <br /><br /> <div>
We present the elemental abundances and ages of 19 massive quiescent galaxies at z ∼ 1.4 and z ∼ 2.1 from the Keck Heavy Metal Survey. The ultradeep LRIS and MOSFIRE spectra were modeled using a full-spectrum stellar population fitting code with variable abundance patterns. The galaxies have iron abundances between [Fe/H] = −0.5 and −0.1 dex, with typical values of −0.2 [−0.3] at z ∼ 1.4 [z ∼ 2.1]. We also find a tentative –[Fe/H] relation at z ∼ 1.4. The magnesium-to-iron ratios span [Mg/Fe] = 0.1–0.6 dex, with typical values of 0.3 [0.5] dex at z ∼ 1.4 [z ∼ 2.1]. The ages imply formation redshifts of zform = 2–8. Compared to quiescent galaxies at lower redshifts, we find that [Fe/H] was ∼0.2 dex lower at z = 1.4–2.1. We find no evolution in [Mg/Fe] out to z ∼ 1.4, though the z ∼ 2.1 galaxies are 0.2 dex enhanced compared to z = 0–0.7. A comparison of these results to a chemical evolution model indicates that galaxies at higher redshift form at progressively earlier epochs and over shorter star formation timescales, with the z ∼ 2.1 galaxies forming the bulk of their stars over 150 Myr at zform ∼ 4. This evolution cannot be solely attributed to an increased number of quiescent galaxies at later times; several Heavy Metal galaxies have extreme chemical properties not found in massive galaxies at z ∼ 0.0–0.7. Thus, the chemical properties of individual galaxies must evolve over time. Minor mergers also cannot fully account for this evolution as they cannot increase [Fe/H], particularly in galaxy centers. Consequently, the buildup of massive quiescent galaxies since z ∼ 2.1 may require further mechanisms, such as major mergers and/or central star formation.

总结: 
在研究中，科学家探讨了原恒星盘的形成过程中磁场和盘旋转之间的对齐关系。他们提出了一种可能的观测方法，即利用“极化孔”来探测磁场和盘旋转之间的对齐情况。通过进行理想磁流体力学模拟，他们发现不同初始磁场和角动量之间的对齐方式会产生不同的磁场结构，从而产生可区分的极化孔。因此，极化孔可能成为磁场和盘旋转对齐关系的探测器，为解决原恒星盘形成过程中的磁场对齐问题提供了新的研究思路。 <div>
The formation of protostellar disks is still a mystery, largely due to the difficulties in observations that can constrain theories. For example, the 3D alignment between the rotation of the disk and the magnetic fields (B-fields) in the formation environment is critical in some models, but so far it is impossible to observe. Here we study the possibility of probing the alignment between B-field and disk rotation using “polarization holes” (PHs). PHs are widely observed and are caused by unresolved B-field structures. With ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate that different initial alignments between B-field and angular momentum (AM) can result in B-field structures that are distinct enough to produce distinguishable PHs. Thus, PHs can potentially serve as probes for alignments between B-field and AM in disk formation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using more than 100 galaxies in the MUSE Ultra Deep Field with spectroscopy from the Hubble Space Telescope’s (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 and the Very Large Telescope’s Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer, we extend the gas-phase mass–metallicity relation (MZR) at z ≈ 1–2 down to stellar masses of M⋆ ≈ 107.5M⊙. The sample reaches 6 times lower in stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) than previous HST studies at these redshifts, and we find that galaxy metallicities decrease to log(O/H) + 12 ≈ 7.8 ± 0.1 (15% solar) at log(M⋆/M⊙) ≈ 7.5, without evidence of a turnover in the shape of the MZR at low masses. We validate our strong-line metallicities using the direct method for sources with [O iii] λ4363 and [O iii] λ1666 detections, and find excellent agreement between the techniques. The [O iii] λ1666-based metallicities double existing measurements with a signal-to-noise ratio ≥ 5 for unlensed sources at z > 1, validating the strong-line calibrations up to z ∼ 2.5. We confirm that the MZR resides ∼0.3 dex lower in metallicity than local galaxies and is consistent with the fundamental metallicity relation if the low-mass slope varies with SFR. At lower redshifts (z ∼ 0.5) our sample reaches ∼0.5 dex lower in SFR than current calibrations and we find enhanced metallicities that are consistent with extrapolating the MZR to lower SFRs. Finally, we detect only an ∼0.1 dex difference in the metallicities of galaxies in groups versus isolated environments. These results are based on robust calibrations and reach the lowest masses and SFRs that are accessible with HST, providing a critical foundation for studies with the Webb and Roman Space Telescopes.

<title>Runaway OB Stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud. III. Updated Kinematics and Insights into Dynamical versus Supernova Ejections</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We use the kinematics of field OB stars to estimate the frequencies of runaway stars generated by the dynamical ejection scenario (DES), the binary supernova scenario (BSS), and the combined two-step mechanism. We update the proper motions for field OB and OBe stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using Gaia DR3. Our sample now contains 336 stars from the Runaways and Isolated O-Type Star Spectroscopic Survey of the SMC, and we update our algorithm to calculate more accurate velocities compared to those obtained previously from DR2. We find a decrease in median velocity from 39 to 29 km s−1, implying that the proper motions from our previous work were systematically overestimated. We present the velocity distribution for OBe stars and quantitatively compare it to those of noncompact binaries and high-mass X-ray binaries. We confirm that OBe stars appear to be dominated by the BSS and are likely post-SN binary systems, further supporting the mass-transfer model to explain the origin of their emission-line disks. In contrast, normal OB stars may show a bimodal velocity distribution, which may be expected from different processes that occur with dynamical ejections. The kinematics of fast-rotating OB stars are similar to those of normal OB stars rather than OBe stars, suggesting that the origin of their high is different from that of OBe stars. We update our model parameters describing the kinematic origins of the SMC field population, still confirming that for runaway stars, the DES mechanism dominates, and two-step ejections seem comparable in frequency to pure BSS ejections.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We conducted an investigation of the Coma cluster of galaxies by running a series of constrained hydrodynamic simulations with GIZMO-SIMBA and GADGET-3 based on initial conditions reconstructed from the SDSS survey volume in the ELUCID project. We compared simulation predictions and observations for galaxies, intracluster medium (ICM) and intergalactic medium (IGM) in and around the Coma cluster to constrain galaxy formation physics. Our results demonstrate that this type of constrained investigation allows us to probe in more detail the implemented physical processes, because the comparison between simulations and observations is free of cosmic variance and hence can be conducted in a “one-to-one” manner. We found that an increase in the earlier star formation rate and the supernova feedback of the original GIZMO-SIMBA model is needed to match observational data on stellar, interstellar medium, and ICM metallicity. The simulations without active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback can well reproduce the observational ICM electron density, temperature, and entropy profiles, ICM substructures, and the IGM temperature–density relation, while the ones with AGN feedback usually fail. However, one requires something like AGN feedback to reproduce a sufficiently large population of quiescent galaxies, particularly in low-density regions. The constrained simulations of the Coma cluster thus provide a test bed to understand processes that drive galaxy formation and evolution.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The main systematics in cluster cosmology is the uncertainty in the mass–observable relation. In this paper, we focus on the most direct cluster observable in optical surveys, i.e., richness, and constrain the intrinsic mass–richness (MR) relation of clusters in THE THREE HUNDRED hydrodynamic simulations with two runs: GIZMO-SIMBA and GADGET-X. We find that modeling the richness at a fixed halo mass with a skewed Gaussian distribution yields a simpler and smaller scatter compared to the commonly used lognormal distribution. Additionally, we observe that baryon models have a significant impact on the scatter while exhibiting no influence on the mass dependence and a slight effect on the amplitude in the MR relation. We select member galaxies based on both stellar mass M⋆ and absolute magnitude . We demonstrate that the MR relations obtained from these two selections can be converted to each other by using the relation. Finally, we provide a seven-parameter fitting result comprehensively capturing the dependence of the MR relation on both stellar mass cutoff and redshift.

According to general relativity, astrophysical black holes are described by a small number of parameters. Apart from the mass of the black hole (M), among the most interesting characteristics is the spin (a), which determines the degree of rotation, i.e., the angular momentum of the black hole. The latter is observationally constrained by the spectral and timing properties of the radiation signal emerging from an accretion disk of matter orbiting near the event horizon. In the case of the planar (standard, equatorial) accretion disk, this is the location of the innermost stable circular orbit that determines the observable radiation characteristics and allows us to measure the spin. In this paper, we discuss a more general case of the innermost stable spherical orbits (ISSOs) extending above and below the equatorial plane. To this end, we study the nonequatorial geodesic motion of particles following inclined, spherical, relativistically precessing trajectories with the aim of exploring the boundary between the regions of stable (energetically bound) and escaping (energetically unbound) motion. The concept of the radius of the ISSO should play a role in determining the inner rim of a tilted or geometrically thick accretion flow. We demonstrate that the region of inclined bound orbits has a complicated structure due to enhanced precession near the inner rim. We also explore the fate of particles launched below the radius of the marginally bound spherical orbit: these may either plunge into the event horizon or escape to radial infinity.

<title>Extinction Values toward Embedded Planets in Protoplanetary Disks Estimated from Hydrodynamic Simulations</title>

Upcoming new coronographs with deeper contrast limits, together with planned and current high-contrast imaging campaigns, will push the detectability limit of protoplanets. These planet-hunting campaigns present a new opportunity to characterize protoplanets and their surrounding environments. However, there are clear uncertainties as to what the extinction levels are at different regions of protoplanetary disks, which will impede our ability to characterize young planets. A correct understanding of the expected extinction, together with multiple photometric observations, will lead to constraints on the extinction levels, dust growth, disk evolution, and protoplanetary accretion rates. In this work, we used hydrodynamic simulations and protoplanetary disk observational constraints obtained from both dust and gas emission to explore the expected extinction maps for continuum filters associated with strong hydrogen lines as tracers of accretion and key broadband photometric filters. We provide a scaling relationship for the extinction as a function of planetary separation and disk mass for three different gas giant masses. We also report values for a subset of disks of interest targeted by multiple imaging campaigns. The described values will be useful for the optimal design of future planet-hunting surveys and for giving context to nondetections in protoplanetary disks and the observed fluxes of point sources along with the birth conditions of protoplanets.

<title>Regions of Suppressed Diffusion around Supernova Remnants?</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3939</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The recent discovery of the so-called TeV halos has attracted much attention. The morphology of the emission requires that the region is characterized by severe suppression of the diffusion coefficient. This finding raises many questions as to its origin: (1) is the suppressed diffusion to be attributed to instabilities induced by the same radiating particles? (2) or does it actually show that the diffusion coefficient is small throughout the disk of the Galaxy? In both cases, one would expect that the surroundings of supernova remnants (SNRs) should also show evidence of a reduced diffusion coefficient since most remnants are located in the disk and are expected to be sites of effective particle acceleration. Should we expect the existence of regions of extended γ-ray emission from these regions as well? Here, we investigate the transport of cosmic rays (CRs) that have escaped from SNRs in order to assess the viability of the idea of having a cocoon of suppressed diffusion around them. A comparison of our results with the γ-ray emission from the regions around HB9 and W28 does not provide solid evidence of reduced diffusivity. However, if indeed the phenomenon of reduced diffusivity occurs around SNRs surrounded by molecular clouds, our calculations show that the effects on the grammage of Galactic CRs can be significant.

<title>Influence of the Gravitational Darkening Effect on the Spectrum of a Hot, Rapidly Rotating Neutron Star. II. Iron Lines</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Rapidly rotating neutron stars are similar to highly flattened ellipsoids. Observed spectra of flattened stars must exhibit effects of nonspherical shape and gravitational darkening. We examined in detail the influence of both effects on the observed central energies and profiles of lines of highly ionized iron, Fe xxv and Fe xxvi. We note that the gravitational darkening effect does not change the central energy of lines. Most importantly, spectra of neutron stars that rotate with different frequencies and are seen at various inclination angles differ significantly. The appearance and the depth of lines strongly depend on the parameters, like the inclination angle of the star or the frequency of the star rotation. In this paper we clearly show that the gravitational darkening effect should be included in realistic models of the atmospheres of the neutron stars.

<title>The Interaction between Stars and Past AGN Disk: Possible Explanation for the Kinematic Distributions of S-stars in the Galactic Center</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad395d</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The presence of young stars, aged around several million years and situated within the range of ∼0.04–1 pc from our Galactic center raises a question about their origins and dynamical evolutions. Their kinematics provide an opportunity to explore their formation or possible subsequent dynamical evolution. If Sagittarius A* was active in the past as suggested by several observations, the accretion disk may have a significant impact on the dynamics of stars in the Galactic center. The drag force exerted on stars during star–disk interaction could lead some of them to sink into the accretion disk, and these embedded stars will rapidly migrate inward and eventually be disrupted within ∼105 yr. This could roughly explain the absence of stars within 2.5 × 104Rg (∼1000 au). Additionally, Kozai–Lidov oscillations, induced by the gravitational perturbation of the disk, could contribute to the bimodal distribution of S-star inclinations and drive a majority of stars into high-eccentricity orbits.

<title>The Study of Mode-switching Behavior of PSR J0614+2229 Using the Parkes Ultra–wide-bandwidth Receiver Observations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad395f</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad395f</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this paper we present a detailed single-pulse and polarization study of PSR J0614+2229 based on the archived data observed on 2019 August 15 (MJD 58710) and 2019 September 12 (MJD 58738) using the ultra−wide-bandwidth low-frequency receiver on the Parkes radio telescope. The single-pulse sequences show that this pulsar switches between two emission states, in which the emission of state A occurs earlier than that of state B in pulse longitude. We found that the variation in relative brightness between the two states varies temporally and both states follow a simple power law very well. Based on the phase-aligned multifrequency profiles, we found that there is a significant difference in the distributions of spectral index across the emission regions of the two states. Furthermore, we obtained the emission height evolution for the two emission states and found that, at a fixed frequency, the emission height of state A is higher than that of state B. What is even more interesting is that the emission heights of both states A and B do not change with frequency. Our results suggest that the mode switching of this pulsar is possibly caused by changes in the emission heights that alter the distributions of spectral index across the emission regions of states A and B, resulting in frequency-dependent behaviors, i.e., intensity and pulse width.

<title>The Huge Magnetic Toroids in the Milky Way Halo</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The magnetic fields in our Milky Way can be revealed by the distribution of Faraday rotation measures (RMs) of radio sources behind the Galaxy and of radio pulsars inside the Galaxy. Based on the antisymmetry of the Faraday sky in the inner Galaxy to the Galactic coordinates, the magnetic field toroids above and below the Galactic plane with reversed field directions exist in the Galactic halo and have been included in almost all models for the global magnetic structure in the Milky Way. However, the quantitative parameters—such as the field strength, the scale height, and the scale radius of the toroids—are hard to determine from observational data. It has long been argued that the RM antisymmetry could be dominated by the local contributions of the interstellar medium. Here, we get the local-discounted RM contributions from the RM sky and RMs of pulsars and get the first quantitative estimate of the sizes of the magnetic toroids in the Galactic halo. They are huge, starting from a Galactocentric radius of less than 2 kpc and extending to at least 15 kpc, without field direction reversals. Such magnetic toroids in the Galactic halo should naturally constrain the physical processes in galaxies.

<title>Primordial Black Hole–Neutron Star Merger Rate in Modified Gravity</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3a66</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this work, we investigate the merger rate of primordial black hole–neutron star (PBH-NS) binaries in two widely studied modified gravity (MG) models: Hu–Sawicki f(R) gravity and the normal branch of Dvali–Gabadadze–Porrati gravity. In our analysis, we take into account the effects of MG on the halo properties, including halo mass function, halo concentration parameter, halo density profile, and velocity dispersion of dark matter particles. We find that these MG models, due to their stronger gravitational field induced by an effective fifth force, predict enhanced merger rates compared to general relativity. This enhancement is found to be redshift-dependent and sensitive to model parameters and PBH mass and fraction. Assuming a PBH mass range of 5–50 M⊙, we compare the predicted merger rate of PBH-NS binaries with those inferred from LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA observations of gravitational waves (GWs). We find that the merger rates obtained from MG models will be consistent with the GW observations if the abundance of PBHs is relatively large, with the exact amount depending on the MG model and its parameter values, as well as PBH mass. We also establish upper limits on the abundance of PBHs in these MG frameworks while comparing them with the existing non-GW constraints, which can potentially impose even more stringent constraints.

<title>21 cm Intensity Mapping with the DSA-2000</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Line-intensity mapping is a promising probe of the Universe’s large-scale structure. We explore the sensitivity of the DSA-2000, a forthcoming array consisting of over 2000 dishes, to the statistical power spectrum of neutral hydrogen’s 21 cm emission line. These measurements would reveal the distribution of neutral hydrogen throughout the near-redshift Universe without necessitating resolving individual sources. The success of these measurements relies on the instrument’s sensitivity and resilience to systematics. We show that the DSA-2000 will have the sensitivity needed to detect the 21 cm power spectrum at z ≈ 0.5 and across power spectrum modes of 0.03–35.12 h Mpc−1 with 0.1 h Mpc−1 resolution. We find that supplementing the nominal array design with a dense core of 200 antennas will expand its sensitivity at low power spectrum modes and enable measurement of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations. Finally, we present a qualitative discussion of the DSA-2000's unique resilience to sources of systematic error that can preclude 21 cm intensity mapping.

Classical machine learning has been actively utilized in astronomy to address various challenges, including predicting orbital stability, classifying asteroids, galaxies, and other objects, and analyzing images. However, the emerging trend in artificial intelligence involves the use of large language models such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT. These models are trained on a large corpus of text and can perform a wide range of natural language processing tasks, including text generation, translation, summarization, and classification. Surprisingly, these capabilities present significant potential for application in astronomy. This paper demonstrates how the new model gpt-4-vision-preview can analyze visual patterns and accurately classify asteroids as resonant or nonresonant with high accuracy. This process requires no training, fine-tuning, or coding beyond writing the appropriate prompt in natural language. Moreover, this approach can be extended to other common problems within astronomy.

<title>Pressure Balance and Energy Budget of the Nuclear Superbubble of NGC 3079</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Superbubbles in the nuclear region of galaxies could be produced by active galactic nuclei (AGN) or nuclear starburst via different driving forces. We report analysis of the multiwavelength data of the kiloparsec-scale nuclear superbubble in NGC 3079 in order to probe the mechanisms driving the expansion of the superbubble. Based on the Chandra X-ray observations, we derive the hot-gas thermal pressure inside the bubble, which is about 1 order of magnitude higher than that of the warm ionized gas traced by optical lines. We derive a [C ii]-based star formation rate (SFR) of SFR ∼ 1.3 M⊙ yr−1 from the nuclear region using the SOFIA/FIFI-LS observation. This SFR infers a radiation pressure toward the bubble shells much lower than the thermal pressure of the gases. The Very Large Array radio image infers that magnetic pressure at the northeast cap above the superbubble is less than the thermal pressure of the hot gas enclosed in the bubble but has a clearly larger extension. The magnetic field may thus still help to reconcile the expansion of the bubble. The observed thermal energy of the hot gas enclosed in the bubble requires an energy injection rate of ≳1042 erg s−1 within the bubble’s dynamical age, which is probably larger than the power provided by the current nuclear starburst and the parsec-scale jet. If this is true, stronger past AGN activity may provide an alternative energy source to drive the observed bubble expansion.

总结: 
James Clerk Maxwell 望远镜的瞬变调查监测了8个古尔德带低质量星体形成区和6个更远的中等质量星体形成区。他们引入了v2流程的相对校准程序，可以在不同时段对影像进行对齐和通量校准。这些新技术在850μm和450μm波段都起作用，并且比v1版本减小了测量误差，并提供了额外的稳健性。相对图像校准达到了比亚毫米波束宽度更小的0.″5的精度。v2的相对通量校准在850μm时是1%，在450μm时小于5%。通过比较两个流程，他们证明了校准的改进，并且可以识别出更多的稳健变量。在6年的观测中，他们发现了四个稳健变量，所有这些在850μm和450μm波段都稳定。多波段光变曲线显示，这些变化与中心源的吸积光度变化导致包层内尘埃的加热有关。 <div>
The James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) Transient Survey has been monitoring eight Gould Belt low-mass star-forming regions since 2015 December and six somewhat more distant intermediate-mass star-forming regions since 2020 February with the Submillimeter Common User Bolometer Array 2 on board JCMT at 450 and 850 μm and with an approximately monthly cadence. We introduce our pipeline v2 relative calibration procedures for image alignment and flux calibration across epochs, improving on our previous pipeline v1 by decreasing measurement uncertainties and providing additional robustness. These new techniques work at both 850 and 450 μm, where version 1 only allowed investigation of the 850 μm data. Pipeline v2 achieves better than 0.″5 relative image alignment, less than a tenth of the submillimeter beam widths. The version 2 relative flux calibration is found to be 1% at 850 μm and <5% at 450 μm. The improvement in the calibration is demonstrated by comparing the two pipelines over the first 4 yr of the survey and recovering additional robust variables with version 2. Using the full 6 yr of the Gould Belt survey, the number of robust variables increases by 50%, and at 450 μm we identify four robust variables, all of which are also robust at 850 μm. The multiwavelength light curves for these sources are investigated and found to be consistent with the variability being due to dust heating within the envelope in response to accretion luminosity changes from the central source.

总结:  
Vera Rubin Observatory即将进行的Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)将为我们提供一次快速调查南半球光学波段的新机会。研究旨在利用LSST观测来约束伽马射线暴余辉和Kilonova（KN）合并光变曲线对不同KN喷流组分的质量和速度进行观测。利用模拟的光变曲线样本进行研究发现，最佳的观测策略是以高频率访问，每隔两晚进行一次4小时的观测，并在至少三个滤光片中收集观测数据。这种观测策略将允许我们识别光变曲线的不同阶段，并有效收集观测数据。 <div>
The upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) opens a new opportunity to rapidly survey the southern sky at optical wavelengths (i.e., ugrizy bands). In this study, we aim to test the possibility of using LSST observations to constrain the mass and velocity of different kilonova (KN) ejecta components from the observation of a combined set of light curves from afterglows of γ-ray bursts and KNe. We used a sample of simulated light curves from the aforementioned events as they would have been seen during the LSST survey to study how the choice of observing strategies impacts the parameter estimation. We found that the design of observing strategy that is the best compromise between light-curve coverage, observed filters, and reliability of the fit involves a high number of visits with long-gap pairs of about 4 hr every two nights in the same or different filters. The features of the observing strategy will allow us to recognize the different stages of the evolution of the light curve and gather observations in at least three filters.

We have analyzed Chandra and Suzaku observations of the globular cluster Terzan 6, made when the recurrent transient GRS 1747–312 was in quiescence. Our analysis reveals the presence of a second eclipsing, bursting neutron star low-mass X-ray binary in the central regions of the cluster, in addition to GRS 1747–312. The new source, which we name Terzan 6 X2, is located only ∼0.″7 away from GRS 1747–312 in the 2021 Chandra images. The detection of a 5.14 ks long eclipse in the light curve of X2 at a time not predicted by the ephemeris of GRS 1747–312 confirms that it is an unrelated source. Using the Suzaku light curve from 2009, which, in addition to a type I X-ray burst, also showed an eclipse-like feature, we constrain the orbital period to be longer than 16.27 hr. The 0.5–10 keV luminosities of X2 vary in the range of ∼0.24–5.9 × 1034 erg s−1 on timescales of months to years. We have identified a plausible optical counterpart of X2 in Hubble Space Telescope F606W and F814W images. This star varied by 2.7 mag in V606 between epochs separated by years. In the cluster color–magnitude diagram, the variable counterpart lies in the blue-straggler region when it was optically bright, about 1.1–1.7 mag above the main-sequence turn-off. From the orbital period–density relation of Roche-lobe filling stars, we find the mass-donor radius to be ≳0.8 R⊙.

The nonrelativistic model of nuclear matter (NM) with zero-range Skyrme interactions is employed within a Bayesian approach in order to study the behavior of the neutron star (NS) equation of state (EOS). A minimal number of constraints from nuclear physics and ab initio calculations of pure neutron matter (PNM) are imposed together with causality and a lower limit on the maximum mass of an NS to all our models. Our key result is that accounting for correlations among the values that the energy per neutron in PNM takes at various densities and that are typically disregarded efficiently constrains the behavior of the EOS at high densities. A series of global NS properties, e.g., maximum mass, central density of the maximum mass configuration, minimum NS mass that allows for direct URCA, and radii of intermediate and massive NSs, appear to be correlated with the value of effective neutron mass in PNM at 0.16 fm−3. Together with similar studies in the literature our work contributes to a better understanding of the NS EOS as well as its link with the properties of dense NM.

研究报告发现了Sombrero星系（NGC 4594）中的10千秒尺度的射电叶，利用了“邻近星系中的连续辐射增强射电幅射”项目的数据。研究者进一步研究了叶内磁压力和周围热气体的热压力之间的平衡。在半径r约为（1-10）kpc处，叶内磁压力和周围热气体的热压力通常是平衡的。这意味着喷流可以扩展到周围，至少到r约10kpc。负责大尺度叶的活跃星系核喷流的反馈可能有助于解释这个宏大、清静独立的盘状星系异常高的X射线亮度，尽管需要更多理论工作来进一步检验这种可能性。 <div>
We report the discovery of the 10 kpc scale radio lobes in the Sombrero galaxy (NGC 4594), using data from the Continuum Halos in Nearby Galaxies—an Expanded Very Large Array Survey project. We further examine the balance between the magnetic pressure inside the lobes and the thermal pressure of the ambient hot gas. At the radii r of ∼(1–10) kpc, the magnetic pressure inside the lobes and the thermal pressure of the ambient hot gas are generally in balance. This implies that the jets could expand into the surroundings to at least r ∼ 10 kpc. The feedback from the active galactic nucleus jet responsible for the large-scale lobes may help to explain the unusually high X-ray luminosity of this massive quiescent isolated disk galaxy, although more theoretical work is needed to further examine this possibility.

<div> 核坍缩超新星，r-过程核合成，光度曲线，探测性，天文观测

总结:
核心坍缩超新星（SNe）可能是r-过程核合成的快速中子俘获过程（r-过程）的候选地点。研究了r-过程核素对富氢SNe的光度曲线的影响，并评估了这些特征的可探测性。修改了辐射流体动力学代码SuperNova Explosion Code，以包括来自超新星（SN）喷发的r-过程元素的近似效应的光度和放射性加热。我们提出了一系列总量r-过程质量Mr的模型以及它们在喷发物中的径向分布，发现对比于普通富氢SNe（不含r-过程元素），Mr≳10−2M⊙足以在它们的光度曲线上产生明显差异。r-过程富集的主要光度特征包括平台阶段的缩短，与氢复合光球撤退到富含r-过程的层相符，并伴随着SN颜色的加红导致的平台后下降更为陡峭。我们将r-过程富集的模型与普通SNe模型和观测数据进行比较，表明当r-过程富含层至少混合到喷射表面的一半时，Mr≳10−2M⊙的产量可能通过瞬变观测者使用的几个指标被检测到。假设仅有一小部分SNe产生了可探测的Mr≳10−2M⊙的r-过程产出，并且尊重对银河总产出率的约束，我们估计需要观测≳103–104个SNe才能发现一个r-富集事件，这一壮举可能会在弗拉·鲁宾天文台实现。 <div>
Core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are candidate sites for rapid neutron capture process (r-process) nucleosynthesis. We explore the effects of enrichment from r-process nuclei on the light curves of hydrogen-rich SNe and assess the detectability of these signatures. We modify the radiation hydrodynamics code, SuperNova Explosion Code, to include the approximate effects of opacity and radioactive heating from r-process elements in the supernova (SN) ejecta. We present models spanning a range of total r-process masses Mr and their assumed radial distribution within the ejecta, finding that Mr ≳ 10−2M⊙ is sufficient to induce appreciable differences in their light curves as compared to ordinary hydrogen-rich SNe (without any r-process elements). The primary photometric signatures of r-process enrichment include a shortening of the plateau phase, coinciding with the hydrogen-recombination photosphere retreating to the r-process-enriched layers, and a steeper post-plateau decline associated with a reddening of the SN colors. We compare our r-process-enriched models to ordinary SNe models and observational data, showing that yields of Mr ≳ 10−2M⊙ are potentially detectable across several of the metrics used by transient observers, provided that r-process-rich layers are mixed at least halfway to the ejecta surface. This detectability threshold can roughly be reproduced analytically using a two-zone (kilonova-within-an-SN) picture. Assuming that a small fraction of SNe produce a detectable r-process yield of Mr ≳ 10−2M⊙, and respecting constraints on the total Galactic production rate, we estimate that ≳103–104 SNe need be observed to find one r-enriched event, a feat that may become possible with the Vera Rubin Observatory.

<title>Supernova Archaeology with X-Ray Binary Winds: The Case of GRO J1655−40</title>

<div> 关键词: 超新星, X射线吸收线, 元素丰度, 双星系统, 高能天体物理学

总结:
超新星爆发造成星系中元素的丰富，而一些超新星可能会留下黑洞。在双星系统中，超新星会污染其伴星，并且黑洞可能会重新吸积自身的碎片并发射X射线。通过测量风中元素的丰度可以推断出历史爆发的情况，并可能识别出已经消失的原恒星。该研究重新分析了2005年GRO J1655−40的爆发的X射线光谱。他们重建了风的吸收度分布(AMD)，发现它随电离度从类氢氧增加到类氢钙，然后趋于平缓。使用AMD来测量18种不同元素的相对丰度。目前的丰度在某种程度上与先前的研究一致，但低Z元素存在差异。奇Z元素的过丰度提示了高金属丰度和高质量(≃25 M⊙)的原星。这些丰度与伴星大气中测量到的不同，表明风中夹杂着残留的超新星碎片，这是可以预期的，因为当前双星系统的总质量(<10 M⊙)比原星质量小得多。 <div>
Supernovae are responsible for the elemental enrichment of the galaxy, and some are postulated to leave behind a black hole. In a stellar binary system, the supernova pollutes its companion, and the black hole can accrete back its own debris and emit X-rays. In this sequence of events, which is only poorly understood, winds are ejected and observed through X-ray absorption lines. Measuring abundances of elements in the wind can lead to inferences about the historical explosion and possibly identify the long-gone progenitor of the compact object. Here, we reanalyze the uniquely rich X-ray spectrum of the 2005 outburst of GRO J1655−40. We reconstruct the absorption measure distribution (AMD) of the wind and find that it increases sharply with ionization from H-like O up to H-like Ca and then flattens out. The AMD is then used to measure the relative abundances of 18 different elements. The present abundances are in partial agreement with a previous work with discrepancies mostly for low-Z elements. The overabundance of odd-Z elements hints at a high-metallicity, high-mass (≃25 M⊙) progenitor. Interestingly, the abundances are different from those measured in the companion atmosphere, indicating that the wind entrains lingering ambient supernova debris. This can be expected since the current total stellar mass of the binary (<10 M⊙) is much less than the progenitor mass.

<div> Lyα emitters, LAEs, z ≈ 3.1, James Webb Space Telescope/NIRCam, SEDs<br />
这项研究利用James Webb Space Telescope/NIRCam在Ultra Deep Survey Field中观测到了10个光谱确认的Lyα辐射体(LAEs)，它们在F090W到F444W波段均有探测，对应的是2200 Å到1.2 μm的静止波长。根据F200W图像，发现有3个目标被分辨为分离小于0.″9的成对系统，另外3个显示不对称结构。构建了这些LAEs的光谱能量分布(SEDs)，显示出几乎没有灭绝。所有来源，包括成对系统，都显示出类似的SED形状，在F200W波段有明显的流量过量，对应着极强的[O iii]+Hβ发射线(EWrest = 740–6500 Å)。样本的中值有效半径、恒星质量和紫外线斜率分别为0.36 kpc、3.8 × 107M⊙和−2.48。平均爆发年龄由恒星质量除以恒星形成速率估计为<40 Myr。这些测量结果揭示了一个引人注目的恒星爆发的矮星系群体，偏离了z ∼ 3的标度关系的外推: 在星形成主序上方约0.7 dex， 在质量-尺寸关系下方约0.35 dex，并且在UV斜率上比具有类似UV亮度的typical高z星系更偏蓝。我们推测这些数字可能需要在向矮星系群体的星爆偏移处需要更大的主序散射或尾部。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究利用James Webb Space Telescope/NIRCam观测到了10个光谱确认的Lyα辐射体(LAEs)，它们显示出非常强的[O iii]+Hβ发射线。这些LAEs构成了一个引人注目的矮星系群体，其性质偏离了已知的标度关系。 <div>
We study 10 spectroscopically confirmed Lyα emitters (LAEs) at z ≈ 3.1 in the Ultra Deep Survey field, covered by the James Webb Space Telescope/NIRCam in the Public Release Imaging for Extragalactic Research program. All LAEs are detected in all NIRCam bands from F090W to F444W, corresponding to rest frame wavelengths of 2200 Å to 1.2 μm. Based on morphological analysis of the F200W images, three out of the 10 targets are resolved into pair-like systems with separations of <0.″9, and another three show asymmetric structures. We then construct the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these LAEs, which show little to no extinction. All sources, including the pairs, show similar SED shapes, with a prominent flux excess in the F200W band, corresponding to extremely strong [O iii]+Hβ emission lines (EWrest = 740–6500 Å). The median effective radii, stellar mass, and UV slope of our sample are 0.36 kpc, 3.8 × 107M⊙, and −2.48, respectively. The average burst age, estimated by stellar mass over star formation rate, is <40 Myr. These measurements reveal an intriguing starbursting dwarf galaxy population lying off the extrapolations of the z ∼ 3 scaling relations to the low-mass end: ∼0.7 dex above the star-forming main sequence, ∼0.35 dex below the mass–size relation, and bluer in the UV slope than typical high-z galaxies at similar UV luminosities. We speculate that these numbers may require a larger main-sequence scatter or tail in the dwarf galaxy regime toward the starburst outliers.

这项研究比较了高斯过程、功率谱和小波分析三种方法在处理周期性或准周期性行为时的效果，分别使用celerite、Lomb-Scargle周期图和加权小波Z变换。该研究以15个快速伽马射线暴（sGRBs）的X射线望远镜光度曲线为例进行了综合分析。研究结果揭示了人为因素在分析中引入的假准周期振荡信号等伪迹的重要性，这些因素可能来自预处理（如去趋势化）或分析的其他方面。本文描述的探索对未来对伽马射线暴、活动星系核以及其他天文源的变化性研究将会有所帮助。<br /><br />总结: 该研究比较了不同方法对变量源时间属性的处理效果，发现人为因素可能引入假信号，可能对未来相关研究有帮助。 <div>
The study of temporal properties of variable sources can elucidate their physical processes. In this context, we present a critical study comparing three approaches to periodic or quasiperiodic behavior: Gaussian process, power spectrum, and wavelet analysis, using celerite, Lomb–Scargle periodograms, and weighted wavelet Z-transforms, respectively. We use 15 Swift X-ray Telescope light curves of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) as examples. A comprehensive analysis of two sGRB X-ray light curves is performed. The results reveal the importance of artifacts, largely in the form of false quasiperiodic oscillation signals, possibly introduced by preprocessing (such as detrending) or other aspects of the analysis. The exploration described in this paper can be helpful for future studies of variability in gamma-ray bursts, active galactic nuclei, and other astronomical sources.

The standard flare model, despite its success, is limited in comprehensively explaining the various processes involving nonthermal particles. One such missing ingredient is a detailed understanding of the various processes involved during the transport of accelerated electrons from their site of acceleration to different parts of the flare region. Here we use simultaneous radio and X-ray observations from the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array and the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays on board the Solar Orbiter, respectively, from two distinct viewing perspectives, to study the electron transport processes. Through detailed spectral modeling of the coronal source using radio data and footpoint sources using X-ray spectra, we compare the nonthermal electron distribution at the coronal and footpoint sources. We find that the flux of the nonthermal electrons precipitated at the footpoint is an order of magnitude greater than that trapped in the looptop, consistent with earlier works that primarily used X-ray for their studies. In addition, we find that the electron spectral indices obtained from X-ray footpoints are significantly softer than the spectral hardness of the nonthermal electron distribution in the corona. We interpret these differences based on transport effects and the difference in sensitivity of microwave and X-ray observations to different regimes of electron energies. Such an understanding is crucial for leveraging different diagnostic methods of nonthermal electrons simultaneously to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the electron acceleration and transport processes of solar flares.

<title>Discovery of Optically Emitting Circumgalactic Nebulae around the Majority of UV-luminous Quasars at Intermediate Redshift</title>

<div> quasars, [O ii]-emitting nebulae, circumgalactic gas, MUSE, redshift<br />
总结:<br />
研究发现在30个UV亮度类星体中，大多数存在着大型的离子化[O ii]发射星周星云。这些星周星云的大小与类星体的红移、亮度、黑洞质量或者射电强度之间没有明显的相关性，但可能与类星体光谱中[O ii]等效宽度相关。在z≈1的类星体周围的星周星云较小且较少，可能是由于中性气体散射、星周星云冷气体含量的演化、围绕z≈1的类星体的较大尺度金属含量低于预期，或者z=3和1之间的类星体寿命变化。 <div>
We report the discovery of large, ionized, [O ii]-emitting circumgalactic nebulae around the majority of 30 UV-luminous quasars at z = 0.4–1.4 observed with deep, wide-field integral field spectroscopy with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopy Explorer (MUSE) by the Cosmic Ultraviolet Baryon Survey and MUSE Quasar Blind Emitters Survey. Among the 30 quasars, seven (23%) exhibit [O ii]-emitting nebulae with major axis sizes greater than 100 kpc, 20 greater than 50 kpc (67%), and 27 (90%) greater than 20 kpc. Such large, optically emitting nebulae indicate that cool, dense, and metal-enriched circumgalactic gas is common in the halos of luminous quasars at intermediate redshift. Several of the largest nebulae exhibit morphologies that suggest interaction-related origins. We detect no correlation between the sizes and cosmological-dimming-corrected surface brightnesses of the nebulae and quasar redshift, luminosity, black hole mass, or radio-loudness, but find a tentative correlation between the nebulae and rest-frame [O ii] equivalent width in the quasar spectra. This potential trend suggests a relationship between interstellar medium content and gas reservoirs on CGM scales. The [O ii]-emitting nebulae around the z ≈ 1 quasars are smaller and less common than Lyα nebulae around z ≈ 3 quasars. These smaller sizes can be explained if the outer regions of the Lyα halos arise from scattering in more neutral gas, by evolution in the cool circumgalactic medium content of quasar-host halos, by lower-than-expected metallicities on ≳50 kpc scales around z ≈ 1 quasars, or by changes in quasar episodic lifetimes between z = 3 and 1.

总结:
IRAS04368+2557是L1527中的一个0/I类原恒星，其具有明显的盘-包层系统，先前的ALMA观测揭示了这一特征。本文讨论了这一源的膨胀结构，包括FAUST ALMA大型项目中观测到的含硫分子。分子分布和动力学的分析表明，CS、SO和OCS追踪盘-包层系统的不同区域。通过两条观测到的SO谱线推导旋转温度，温度分布显示出明显的膨胀“蝴蝶”结构，较高的温度约为50K，中心较低的温度区域（<30K）与连续谱峰值重合，暗示动力学产生的加热而非来自中心原恒星的辐射加热。其他物理性质，包括柱密度，也被估算并进一步用于展示盘-包层系统的垂直结构。我们的分析确认了L1527的“扭曲”盘结构，显示含硫分子不仅是有效的材料探针，而且对原恒星系统的结构研究也足够充分。 <div>
IRAS04368+2557 in L1527 is a Class 0/I protostar with a clear disk-envelope system revealed by previous Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations. In this paper, we discuss the flared structure of this source with observed sulfur-bearing molecules included in the FAUST ALMA large program. The analyses of molecular distributions and kinematics have shown that CS, SO, and OCS trace different regions of the disk-envelope system. To evaluate the temperature across the disk, we derive rotation temperature with the two observed SO lines. The temperature profile shows a clear, flared “butterfly” structure with the higher temperature being ∼50 K and the central lower temperature region (<30 K) coinciding with the continuum peak, suggesting dynamically originated heating rather than radiation heating from the central protostar. Other physical properties, including column densities, are also estimated and further used to demonstrate the vertical structure of the disk-envelope system. The “warped” disk structure of L1527 is confirmed with our analyses, showing that sulfur-bearing molecules are not only effective material probes but also sufficient for structural studies of protostellar systems.

<title>Revisiting the Vertical Distribution of H i Absorbing Clouds in the Solar Neighborhood</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The vertical distribution of cold neutral hydrogen (H i) clouds is a constraint on models of the structure, dynamics, and hydrostatic balance of the interstellar medium. In 1978, Crovisier pioneered a method to infer the vertical distribution of H i absorbing clouds in the solar neighborhood. Using data from the Nançay 21 cm absorption survey, Crovisier determined the mean vertical displacement of cold H i clouds, 〈∣z∣〉. We revisit that author’s analysis and explore the consequences of truncating the H i absorption sample in Galactic latitude. For any nonzero latitude limit, we find that the quantity inferred by Crovisier is not the mean vertical displacement but rather a ratio involving higher moments of the vertical distribution. The resultant distribution scale heights are thus ∼1.5 to ∼3 times smaller than previously determined. In light of this discovery, we develop a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain method to infer the vertical distribution of H i absorbing clouds. We fit our model to the original Nançay data and find a vertical distribution moment ratio 〈∣z∣3〉/〈∣z∣2〉 = 97 ± 15 pc, which corresponds to a Gaussian scale height σz = 61 ± 9 pc, an exponential scale height λz = 32 ± 5 pc, and a rectangular half-width Wz,1/2 = 129 ± 20 pc. Consistent with recent simulations, the vertical scale height of cold H i clouds appears to remain constant between the inner Galaxy and the Galactocentric distance of the solar neighborhood. Local fluctuations might explain the large-scale height observed at the same Galactocentric distance on the far side of the Galaxy.

<title>TriOS Schwarzschild Orbit Modeling: Robustness of Parameter Inference for Masses and Shapes of Triaxial Galaxies with Supermassive Black Holes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Evidence for the majority of the supermassive black holes in the local Universe has been obtained dynamically from stellar motions with the Schwarzschild orbit superposition method. However, there have been only a handful of studies using simulated data to examine the ability of this method to reliably recover known input black hole masses MBH and other galaxy parameters. Here, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of the reliability of the triaxial Schwarzschild method at simultaneously determining MBH, stellar mass-to-light ratio M*/L, dark matter mass, and three intrinsic triaxial shape parameters of simulated galaxies. For each of 25 rounds of mock observations using simulated stellar kinematics and the TriOS code, we derive best-fitting parameters and confidence intervals after a full search in the 6D parameter space with our likelihood-based model inference scheme. The two key mass parameters, MBH and M*/L, are recovered within the 68% confidence interval, and other parameters are recovered between the 68% and 95% confidence intervals. The spatially varying velocity anisotropy of the stellar orbits is also well recovered. We explore whether the goodness-of-fit measure used for galaxy model selection in our pipeline is biased by variable complexity across the 6D parameter space. In our tests, adding a penalty term to the likelihood measure either makes little difference, or worsens the recovery in some cases.

<div> GRB, XRT, early X-ray emissions, cosmological time dilation, BdHN<br />
总结:<br />
这篇文章讨论了通过利用宇宙时间膨胀来观测早期伽马射线暴中的X射线辐射。研究发现，在三个GRB事件中成功观测到了极早期的X射线余辉辐射，验证了二元驱动超新星(BdHN)场景中碳氧核坍缩和新生中子星形成导致GRB事件的观测。此外，分析长 GRB 红移分布，推断出 Bdhne II 和 III 可能是短 GRB 的中子星二进制源。此外还研究了 νNS 的自转速率和其与引力波信号的相关性。 <div>
The repointing time of the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) instrument on the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory satellite has posed challenges in observing and studying the early X-ray emissions within ≈40 s after a gamma-ray burst (GRB) trigger. To address this issue, we adopt a novel approach that capitalizes on the cosmological time dilation in GRBs with redshifts ranging from 3 to 9. Applying this strategy to Swift/XRT data, we investigate the earliest X-ray emissions of 368 GRBs from the Swift catalog, including short and long GRBs. We compare the observed time delay between the GRB trigger and the initial Swift/XRT observation, measured in the GRB observer frame, and the corresponding cosmological rest-frame time delay (RTD). This technique is here used in the analysis of GRB 090423 at z = 8.233 (RTD ∼8.2 s), GRB 090429B at z ≈ 9.4 (RTD ∼10.1 s), and GRB 220101A at z = 4.61 (RTD ∼14.4 s). The cosmological time dilation enables us to observe the very early X-ray afterglow emission in these three GRBs. We thus validate the observation of the collapse of the carbon–oxygen core and the coeval newborn neutron star (νNS) formation triggering the GRB event in the binary-driven hypernova (BdHN) scenario. We also evidence the νNS spin-up due to supernova ejecta fallback and its subsequent slowing down due to the X-ray/optical/radio synchrotron afterglow emission. A brief gravitational-wave signal may separate the two stages owing to a fast-spinning νNS triaxial-to-axisymmetric transition. We also analyze the long GRB redshift distribution for the different BdHN types and infer that BdHNe II and III may originate the NS binary progenitors of short GRBs.

We present evidence supporting wave reflection in the lower solar chromosphere based on helioseismic analysis of multi-height Doppler data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager and the Magneto-Optical filters at Two Heights II instrument. This evidence is derived through a wave propagation model that incorporates both upward- and downward-traveling (reflected) waves. Moreover, we find that the height of the reflecting region varies with magnetic field strengths in a way that suggests a connection with the plasma β ∼ 1 region. We measure an effective reflection coefficient of 13% in a magnetically quiet region of the Sun.

<div> JWST, LLAGN, MIRI, NGC 1052, Sombrero
总结:<br /><br />该研究报告了ReveaLLAGN调查的首批结果，重点关注了七个附近低光度活动星系核（LLAGN）的研究。研究使用JWST的中红外仪器（MIRI）的中分辨率光谱仪观测了NGC 1052和NGC 4594/M104（Sombrero）的核区，并将这些数据与更高光度AGN的公开JWST数据进行了比较。研究发现JWST清晰地将AGN光谱与星系光分离，即使是在最暗淡的Sombrero中也能做到；AGN成分具有非常红色的光谱。此外，NGC 1052和Sombrero中的发射线宽随着电离势的增加而增加，对于电离势≳50 eV的线宽达到FWHM > 1000 km s−1。这些特征以及两个星系中的发射线图与喷流方向一致，表明存在沿着喷流方向的流出现象。Sombrero中的[Ne v]和[O iv]是迄今为止在中红外中测量到的最低光度高电离势线，但是这些线的相对强度与更高光度AGN的相一致。然而，[Ne v]发射线相对于[Ne iii]和[Ne ii]线要弱得多。这些初步结果展示了JWST对于识别和研究LLAGN的物理本质的巨大潜力。 <div>
We present the first results from the Revealing Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (ReveaLLAGN) survey, a JWST survey of seven nearby LLAGNs. We focus on two observations with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI)’s Medium-Resolution Spectrometer of the nuclei of NGC 1052 and Sombrero (NGC 4594/M104). We also compare these data to public JWST data of higher-luminosity AGNs, NGC 7319 and NGC 7469. JWST clearly separates the AGN spectrum from the galaxy light even in Sombrero, the faintest target in our survey; the AGN components have very red spectra. We find that the emission-line widths in both NGC 1052 and Sombrero increase with increasing ionization potential, with FWHM > 1000 km s−1 for lines with ionization potential ≳ 50 eV. These lines are also significantly blueshifted in both LLAGNs. The high-ionization-potential lines in NGC 7319 show neither broad widths nor significant blueshifts. Many of the lower-ionization-potential emission lines in Sombrero show significant blue wings extending >1000 km s−1. These features and the emission-line maps in both galaxies are consistent with outflows along the jet direction. Sombrero has the lowest-luminosity high-ionization-potential lines ([Ne v] and [O iv]) ever measured in the mid-infrared, but the relative strengths of these lines are consistent with higher-luminosity AGNs. On the other hand, the [Ne v] emission is much weaker relative to the [Ne iii] and [Ne ii] lines of higher-luminosity AGNs. These initial results show the great promise that JWST holds for identifying and studying the physical nature of LLAGNs.

<div> 关键词: 多峰超新星、光谱变化、天文观测、光度曲线、赤道轰炸

总结:
天文学家们通过现代的夜空短暂现象调查，如兹威基瞬变设施，发现了越来越多的多峰超新星，这些超新星具有先兆、光度曲线再次变亮和光谱转变等特点。本文中介绍了SN 2023aew的观测和分析，该超新星在初始发光期后出现了明显的再次变亮。SN 2023aew在第一个峰值期间被分类为IIb型超新星，但在明显的再次变亮后改变了类型，类似于剥离外壳的超新星。文章还对SN 2023aew的光谱演化与剥离外壳超新星亚型进行了比较，并讨论了SN 2023aew的可能起源，包括一个情景，在这种情况下，超新星的一部分外壳在第一个峰值期间被喷射出来，并通过与星周介质的相互作用驱动了光度曲线的第二个峰值。 <div>
Multipeaked supernovae with precursors, dramatic light-curve rebrightenings, and spectral transformation are rare, but are being discovered in increasing numbers by modern night-sky transient surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility. Here, we present the observations and analysis of SN 2023aew, which showed a dramatic increase in brightness following an initial luminous (−17.4 mag) and long (∼100 days) unusual first peak (possibly precursor). SN 2023aew was classified as a Type IIb supernova during the first peak but changed its type to resemble a stripped-envelope supernova (SESN) after the marked rebrightening. We present comparisons of SN 2023aew’s spectral evolution with SESN subtypes and argue that it is similar to SNe Ibc during its main peak. P-Cygni Balmer lines are present during the first peak, but vanish during the second peak’s photospheric phase, before Hα resurfaces again during the nebular phase. The nebular lines ([O i], [Ca ii], Mg i], Hα) exhibit a double-peaked structure that hints toward a clumpy or nonspherical ejecta. We analyze the second peak in the light curve of SN 2023aew and find it to be broader than that of normal SESNe as well as requiring a very high 56Ni mass to power the peak luminosity. We discuss the possible origins of SN 2023aew including an eruption scenario where a part of the envelope is ejected during the first peak and also powers the second peak of the light curve through interaction of the SN with the circumstellar medium.

总结:<br />
本研究受到磁层多尺度航天器任务在地球磁尾重连射流区观测到的非线性静电波签名的启发，探索了磁尾中离子声激波的动力学特征。研究中考察了由两个相向离子流和超热电子组成的非麦克斯韦空间等离子体中离子声亚音速激波的动力学和特性，假设电子遵循κ分布。采用还原摄动技术建立了小幅度静电激波结构的演化方程。重要的是，亚音速波仅在束流速度超过一定阈值时存在，在该阈值之上超音速和亚音速波可能共存。分析了束流速度和非麦克斯韦电子统计量的联合影响，以研究亚音速激波的特性。考虑了对称和非对称（相对束流密度）模型，导致亚音速激波演化中存在不同的可能性。该研究结果将有助于揭示磁层中可能形成和传播的相对未探索的亚音速激波的动力学特征。 <div>
Motivated by the signatures of nonlinear electrostatic waves observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft mission in reconnection jet regions of Earth's magnetotail, we have explored the dynamical features of ion-acoustic shock waves in the magnetotail. In this investigation, we have examined the dynamics and characteristics of ion-acoustic subsonic shock waves in non-Maxwellian space plasma comprising of two counterstreaming ion beams with suprathermal electrons, assumed to follow a kappa (κ) distribution. A reductive perturbation technique has been adopted to establish an evolution equation for small amplitude electrostatic shock structures. Importantly, subsonic waves only exist when the beam velocity exceeds a certain threshold, beyond which supersonic and subsonic waves may coexist. The combined effects of the beam velocity and the non-Maxwellian electron statistics have been analyzed to examine the characteristics of subsonic shock waves. Both symmetric and asymmetric (in relative beam density) models have been considered, leading to distinct possibilities in the evolution of subsonic shock waves. The findings of the investigation will help unfold the relatively unexplored dynamical characteristics of subsonic shock waves that may form and propagate in the magnetosphere.

Solar active regions (ARs) contain a broad range of temperatures, with the thermal plasma distribution often observed to peak in the few millions of kelvin. Differential emission measure (DEM) analysis can allow instruments with diverse temperature responses to be used in concert to estimate this distribution. Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope ARray (NuSTAR) hard X-ray (HXR) observations are uniquely sensitive to the highest-temperature components of the corona, and thus extremely powerful for examining signatures of reconnection-driven heating. Here, we use NuSTAR diagnostics in combination with extreme-ultraviolet and soft X-ray observations (from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and Hinode/X-Ray Telescope) to construct DEMs over 170 distinct time intervals during a 5 hr observation of an alternately flaring and quiet active region (NOAA designation AR 12712). This represents the first HXR study to examine the time evolution of the distribution of thermal plasma in an AR. During microflares, we find that the initial microflare-associated plasma heating is predominantly heating of material that is already relatively hot, followed later on by broader heating of initially cooler material. During quiescent times, we show that the amount of extremely hot (>10 MK) material in this region is significantly (∼2–4 orders of magnitude) less than that found in the quiescent AR observed in HXRs by FOXSI-2. This result implies there can be radically different high-temperature thermal distributions in different ARs, and strongly motivates future HXR DEM studies covering a large number of these regions.

<div> MeerKAT DEEP2 field, redshifts, radio luminosity functions, star formation rate density (SFRD), systematic errors
<br /><br />总结:
研究对MeerKAT DEEP2领域中3839个星系进行了红移测定，发现在0.2 < z < 1.3范围内，无线电亮度函数与先前模型推断的结果一致，证实了在这个红移范围内基于无线电的星形成速率密度（SFRD）比基于紫外-红外的测量结果高出50%。文章讨论了系统误差，但即使考虑所有系统误差，也不能解释在0.5 < z < 1.3范围内基于无线电的SFRD测量与基于紫外-红外的测量之间的差异。作者得出结论，对宇宙中星形成预算的全面确认仍需大量工作。 <div>
We present the initial sample of redshifts for 3839 galaxies in the MeerKAT DEEP2 field—the most sensitive ∼1.4 GHz radio field yet observed with σn = 0.55 μ Jy beam−1, reaching the confusion limit. Using a spectrophotometric technique combining coarse optical spectra with broadband photometry, we obtain redshifts with σz ≲ 0.01(1 + z), as determined from repeat observations. The resulting radio luminosity functions between 0.2 < z < 1.3 from our sample of 3839 individual galaxies are in remarkable agreement with those inferred from previous modeling of radio source counts, confirming a ≳50% excess in radio-based star formation rate density (SFRD) (z) measurements at 0.2 < z < 1.3 compared to those from the UV–IR. Several sources of systematic error are discussed—totalling ∼0.13 dex when added in quadrature. Even in the event that all systematic errors work to decrease the radio-based SFRD values, they are incapable of reconciling differences between the radio-based measurements with those from the UV–IR at 0.5 < z < 1.3. We conclude that significant work remains to have confidence in a full accounting of the star formation budget of the Universe.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究对Mon OB1区域进行了全面的CO研究，发现了复杂的分子气体结构和各种形态，通过高斯分解和聚类分析鉴定出263个13CO结构，并指出了密度较高的气体主要集中在多个13CO结构重叠的区域。结合Gaia DR3的数据，估算出巨大分子云复合体的平均距离，其总质量分别为1.1 × 105M⊙、4.3 × 104M⊙和8.4 × 103M⊙。研究结果显示星形成活动对周围分子气体的物理特性有着巨大影响，而同时分子气体环境也与附近的星形成区域密切相关。 <div>
We perform a comprehensive CO study toward the Monoceros OB1 (Mon OB1) region based on the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting survey at an angular resolution of about 50″. The high-sensitivity data, together with the high dynamic range, show that molecular gas in the 8° × 4° region displays complicated hierarchical structures and various morphology (e.g., filamentary, cavity-like, shell-like, and other irregular structures). Based on Gaussian decomposition and clustering for 13CO data, a total of 263 13CO structures are identified in the whole region, and 88% of raw data flux is recovered. The dense gas with relatively high column density from the integrated CO emission is mainly concentrated in the region where multiple 13CO structures are overlapped. Combining the results of 32 large 13CO structures with distances from Gaia DR3, we estimate an average distance of for the giant molecular cloud (GMC) complex. The total mass of the GMC complex traced by 12CO, 13CO, and C18O is 1.1 × 105M⊙, 4.3 × 104M⊙, and 8.4 × 103M⊙, respectively. The dense gas fraction shows a clear difference between Mon OB1 GMC East (12.4%) and Mon OB1 GMC West (3.3%). Our results show that the dense gas environment is closely linked to the nearby star-forming regions. On the other hand, star-forming activities have a great influence on the physical properties of the surrounding molecular gas (larger velocity dispersion, higher temperatures, more complex velocity structures, etc.). We also discuss the distribution/kinematics of molecular gas associated with nearby star-forming activities.

总结：<br /><br />本文讨论了三个属于紧缩对称天体（CSO）类别的射电喧哗活动星系核（AGN），它们具有检测到的窄Fe Kα线。文章使用Chandra X射线天文台和亚毫米阵列（SMA）的新观测数据，分析了J1407+2827、J1511+0518和J2022+6137的射电至γ射线光谱。新的Chandra数据排除了大于1.″5尺度的扩展X射线发射成分的存在。SMA数据揭示了射电叶子中电子分布的谱指数与NH之间的关联，这可以解释高度阻塞CSOs的γ射线安静特性。文章认为，紧缩射电叶子的逆康普顿辐射可能解释了所有这些源的固有X射线连续谱。此外，文章提出观察到的铁线可能是由周围冷尘的紧缩射电叶子连续谱的反射产生的。 <div>
X-ray continuum emission of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) may be reflected by circumnuclear dusty tori, producing prominent fluorescence iron lines at X-ray frequencies. Here, we discuss the broadband emission of three radio-loud AGNs belonging to the class of compact symmetric objects (CSOs), with detected narrow Fe Kα lines. CSOs have newly born radio jets, forming compact radio lobes with projected linear sizes of the order of a few to hundreds of parsecs. We model the radio-to-γ-ray spectra of compact lobes in J1407+2827, J1511+0518, and J2022+6137, which are among the nearest and the youngest CSOs known to date, and are characterized by an intrinsic X-ray absorbing column density of NH > 1023 cm−2. In addition to the archival data, we analyze the newly acquired Chandra X-ray Observatory and Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations, and also refine the γ-ray upper limits from Fermi Large Area Telescope monitoring. The new Chandra data exclude the presence of the extended X-ray emission components on scales larger than 1.″5. The SMA data unveil a correlation between the spectral index of the electron distribution in the lobes and NH, which can explain the γ-ray quietness of heavily obscured CSOs. Based on our modeling, we argue that the inverse-Compton emission of compact radio lobes may account for the intrinsic X-ray continuum in all these sources. Furthermore, we propose that the observed iron lines may be produced by a reflection of the lobes’ continuum from the surrounding cold dust.

In this study, we present the analysis of six solar flare events that occurred in 2022, using new data from the third-generation Miniature X-Ray Solar Spectrometer, also known as the Dual-zone Aperture X-ray Solar Spectrometer (DAXSS). The primary focus of this study is on the flare’s onset phase, which is characterized by elevated soft X-ray emissions even before the flare’s impulsive phase. We analyze the temporal evolution of plasma temperature, emission measure, and elemental abundance factors during the flare onset phase by fitting the DAXSS spectra with the Astrophysical Plasma Emission Code model. The model fitting results indicate that the flaring plasma is already at a high temperature (10–15 MK) during the onset period. The temperature rises during the onset phase, followed by a decrease and subsequent increase during the impulsive phase. Elemental abundance factors show a trend of falling below preflare values during the onset phase, with some recovery before the impulsive phase. During the impulsive phase, the abundance factors decrease from elevated coronal values to about photospheric values. We also analyze images from the 193 Å channel of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), highlighting the formation or brightening of coronal loop structures during the onset phase. Two distinct onset loop configurations are observed, which are referred to as one-loop and two-loop onsets. Both DAXSS and AIA observations indicate that the flare onset phase exhibits hot coronal plasma properties similar to those of the impulsive phase, suggesting that the onset phase may act as a preconditioning effect for some flares.

总结：<br /><br />这篇文章提出了关于差异旋转恒星赤道处的涡动的自洽饱和理论。文章阐述了Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke不稳定性的驱动机制，并提出了一个统计闭合近似，以解释这种涡动的形成和发展过程。研究者推导了动量和热量的涡动传输速率，并提供了解析形式的公式。这些理论模型经过直接数值模拟的测试，结果显示良好的一致性。该理论还扩展到了热量和组分输运的研究，并在某些情况下取得了一致的结果。 <div>
Differentially rotating stars and planets transport angular momentum (AM) internally due to turbulence at rates that have long been a challenge to predict reliably. We develop a self-consistent saturation theory, using a statistical closure approximation, for hydrodynamic turbulence driven by the axisymmetric Goldreich–Schubert–Fricke instability at the stellar equator with radial differential rotation. This instability arises when fast thermal diffusion eliminates the stabilizing effects of buoyancy forces in a system where a stabilizing entropy gradient dominates over the destabilizing AM gradient. Our turbulence closure invokes a dominant three-wave coupling between pairs of linearly unstable eigenmodes and a near-zero frequency, viscously damped eigenmode that features latitudinal jets. We derive turbulent transport rates of momentum and heat and provide them in analytic forms. Such formulae, free of tunable model parameters, are tested against direct numerical simulations; the comparison shows good agreement. They improve upon prior quasi-linear or “parasitic saturation” models containing a free parameter. Given model correspondences, we also extend this theory to heat and compositional transport for axisymmetric thermohaline-instability-driven turbulence in certain regimes.

<div> 搜索外星智能，人工广播，单独搜索，混淆效应，集体约束<br />
总结：<br />
这篇文章讨论了搜索外星智能的方法，包括对其他星系中人工广播的限制。先前的方法使用个体主义方法，搜索信噪比高的单一广播，但这种方法限于非常明亮的广播，并且容易受到混淆的影响。因此作者提出了一种集体约束的新方法，通过评估混淆对个体主义搜索的影响，并比较了单独搜索和集体方法在银河系、M31和Virgo星系团中椭圆星系的广播。研究发现，集体约束对广播种群参数空间有很强的约束力，甚至对遥远星系的广播也有限制，并对最近的星系中的伽马射线、中微子和引力波广播也施加约束。 <div>
The search for extraterrestrial intelligence includes efforts to constrain populations of artificial broadcasts in other galaxies. Previous efforts use individualist methods, searching for single broadcasts with high signal-to-noise ratio. These would be detected as observables with extreme values. This approach is limited to very bright broadcasts and also is subject to confusion, where a large number of broadcasts blend together to form a noise continuum. The mean value of the total emission provides an additional collective bound: the luminosity of the transmitters is no higher than the galaxy’s observed luminosity. Using the framework developed in Paper I, I evaluate how confusion affects individualist searches. I then compare individualist and collective approaches for radio broadcasts from the Milky Way, M31, and three Virgo Cluster elliptical galaxies. For current observations, confusion blurs narrowband radio broadcasts together in the Virgo ellipticals when there is one broadcast per gigahertz per 1000 stars. The collective bound implies fewer than L-band broadcasts per star per gigahertz in the Milky Way wideband and is about 10 and 400 times stronger in M31 and M59, respectively. Applying the collective bound to the far-infrared–radio correlation yields constraints on radio broadcast populations in star-forming galaxies throughout the Universe. The collective bound allows us to rule out large regions of broadcast population parameter space even for distant galaxies. It also imposes constraints on gamma-ray, neutrino, and gravitational-wave broadcasts in the nearest galaxies.

这篇文章讨论了假设类外智慧生命的假设性广播现象，提出了一种概率形式主义来描述它们的共同历史和性质分布。通过随机点过程在参数超空间中建模各种外星社会和其广播的分布，并且利用复合泊松随机变量来模拟可观测量。文章还重新推导了Drake方程，指出在没有扩张的情况下，探测到的广播数量可能与恒星质量呈二次关系，建议寻找大星系来进行搜索。 <div>
Artificial broadcasts from extraterrestrial intelligences are a hypothetical class of celestial phenomena. Unlike known astrophysical objects, the societies that generate them may be able to replicate on galactic scales through interstellar travel. Different galaxies could thus have drastically different populations, with variations in abundance of many orders of magnitude. I present a probabilistic formalism to treat this shared history, in which societies and their broadcasts are described by distributions over basic properties like lifespan and energy released. The framework contains a hierarchy of objects related by a tree structure. Discrete societies, the sources of broadcasts, are organized into potentially interstellar metasocieties. The population of each type of object is represented by a random point process in an abstract parameter hyperspace, a haystack. When a selection like an observation draws a sample, the point process is thinned. Given assumptions of interchangeability and independence, observables are modeled with compound Poisson random variables. I present an example of how selection bias can favor sampling longer-lived objects. I rederive the Drake equation for societies in the limit of no expansion. When interstellar replication is present, however, the mean number of detected broadcasts can depend quadratically on stellar mass, suggesting a search strategy favoring large galaxies.

在这篇论文中，研究人员进行了对J1044+0353周围的全息场光谱观测。他们发现该星系是一个低金属度快速增长的星系，产生了极端的[O iii]发射线。新的O32流量比图揭示了一个从星爆中心出现的密度边界的电离锥。氢电离辐射与星暴之前通过星系流出开凿的空腔相互作用，决定了全局莱曼连续辐射的逃逸路径。研究人员还发现，距离年轻的星暴中心几百秒差距的区域显示出超泡突破和吹出对[O iii]发射线的不同成分的贡献，分别为宽和非常宽的发射线翼。他们指出，宽组分的大量[O iii]发光来自光电电离的超泡壳，而不是通常假设的星系风。他们还观察到了空间分辨的He iiλ4686星云，显示出被年轻星团光电离的特征。这些星团的恒星风发射激发了He ii线的线翼。这种较宽的He ii成分显示出缓慢的恒星风，与J1044+0353的金属丰度下增加的恒星旋转（和有效逃逸速度降低）一致。至少在J1044+0353中，最近的星形成历史在产生莱曼连续辐射的全局路径上起着关键作用，这种非均向逃逸很可能被对莱曼连续辐射的直接观测所忽略。<br /><br />总结: 本论文通过全息场光谱对J1044+0353进行了研究，发现了低金属度星系的特点，揭示了氢电离辐射与星系流动相互作用的全局逃逸路径，以及He ii星云的特征和恒星风的影响。 <div>
We present integral field spectroscopy toward and around J1044+0353, a rapidly growing, low-metallicity galaxy that produces extreme [O iii] line emission. A new map of the O32 flux ratio reveals a density-bounded ionization cone emerging from the starburst. The interaction of the hydrogen-ionizing radiation, produced by the very young starburst, with a cavity previously carved out by a galactic outflow, whose apex lies well outside the starburst region, determines the pathway for global Lyman continuum (LyC) escape. In the region within a few hundred parsecs of the young starburst, we demonstrate that superbubble breakthrough and blowout contribute distinct components to the [O iii] line profile: broad and very broad emission line wings, respectively. We draw attention to the large [O iii] luminosity of the broad component and argue that this emission comes from photoionized, superbubble shells rather than a galactic wind as is often assumed. The spatially resolved He iiλ4686 nebula appears to be photoionized by young star clusters. Stellar wind emission from these stars is likely the source of line wings detected on the He ii line profile. This broader He ii component indicates slow stellar winds, consistent with an increase in stellar rotation (and a decrease in effective escape speed) at the metallicity of J1044+0353. At least in J1044+0353, the recent star formation history plays a critical role in generating a global pathway for LyC escape, and the anisotropic escape would likely be missed by direct observations of the LyC.

该研究使用Atacama Compact Array对IRAS 15398−3359进行了观测，发现了第三个与原恒星相关的流出并且检测到北西方向的新红移组分。这些发现表明，流出的发射方向可能随时间发生了显著变化。研究人员认为这可能是因为旋转轴和磁场不对齐或者密集核心湍流所致。与数值模拟结果的比较支持了这一假设。总之，这些发现为我们提供了关于IRAS 15398−3359的多个流出的重要信息，为我们理解类星体的形成和演化提供了有益的线索。<br /><br />总结: Class 0原恒星在CO J=2-1线观测中发现了多个流出，其中一些流出与之前观测的主要和次要流出不同向。研究人员认为这可能是流出发射方向随时间发生显著变化的结果。与数值模拟结果的比较支持了这一假设。 <div>
We present the results of our mosaic observations of a single Class 0 protostar IRAS 15398−3359 with the Atacama Compact Array in the CO J = 2–1 line. The new observations covering a square region reveal elongated redshifted and blueshifted components, which are located at distances of ∼30″–75″ on the northern and southern sides of the protostar, respectively, in addition to the previously observed primary and secondary outflows. These elongated components exhibit Hubble-law-like velocity structures, i.e., an increase of velocity with increasing distance from the protostar, suggesting that they comprise the third outflow associated with the protostar. Besides, a new redshifted component is detected at radii of ∼40″–75″ on the northwestern side of the protostar. This redshifted component also exhibits a Hubble-law-like velocity profile, which could be a counterpart of the secondary outflow mostly detected at blueshifted velocities in a previous study. The three outflows are all misaligned by ∼20°–90°, and the dynamical timescale of the primary outflow is shorter than those of the other outflows, approximately by an order of magnitude. These facts hint that the outflow launch direction has significantly changed with time. The outflow direction may change if the rotational axis and the magnetic field are misaligned or if the dense core is turbulent. We favor the second scenario as the origin of the multiple outflows in IRAS 15398−3359, based on a comparison between the observational results and numerical simulations.

<div> 关键词: JWST, 化学反应网络, 模型, 外行星大气, 自动化

总结:
JWST的出现促使对外行星大气进行更加完整的化学和光化学反应的研究需求。传统的手动构建反应网络的方法耗时且容易出错，且适用性有限。本文提出了一种自动化的方法，利用计算机辅助化学反应网络生成器，结合一维光化学动力学传输模型，自动选择反应速率，提高了模型的可靠性，并能够有效模拟不同的化学环境。作者使用WASP-39b和WASP-80b作为例子，证明了他们的方法的有效性，与最近的JWST数据取得了良好的一致性。这种自动化的化学网络生成方法为研究外行星大气提供了一个新颖、高效和精确的框架，是传统建模技术的重大进步。 <div>
With the advent of JWST and the spectroscopic characterization of exoplanet atmospheres in unprecedented detail, there is a demand for more complete pictures of chemical and photochemical reactions and their impacts on atmospheric composition. Traditionally, building reaction networks for (exo)planetary atmospheres involves manually tracking relevant species and reactions, a time-consuming and error-prone process. This approach’s applicability is also often limited to specific conditions, making it less versatile for different planetary types (i.e., photochemical networks for Jupiters may not be directly applicable to water-rich exoplanets). We introduce an automated approach using a computer-aided chemical reaction network generator, combined with a 1D photochemical kinetic-transport model, offering significant advantages. This approach automatically selects reaction rates through a rate-based iterative algorithm and multiple refinement steps, enhancing model reliability. Also, this approach allows for the efficient simulation of diverse chemical environments, from hydrogen to water, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen-dominated atmospheres. Using WASP-39b and WASP-80b as examples, we demonstrate our approach’s effectiveness, showing good agreement with recent JWST data. Our WASP-39b model aligns with prior studies and JWST observations, capturing photochemically produced sulfur dioxide. The WASP-80b model reveals an atmosphere influenced by deep-interior thermochemistry and vertical mixing, consistent with JWST NIRCam observations. Furthermore, our model identifies a novel initial step for the N2–NH3–HCN pathway that enhances the efficiency of the conversion in high-temperature/high-pressure environments. This automated chemical network generation offers a novel, efficient, and precise framework for studying exoplanetary atmospheres, marking a significant advancement over traditional modeling techniques.

本研究在Magellan+Megacam调查中对NGC 253进行了系统性搜索，发现了5个卫星，其中4个通过深度哈勃空间望远镜成像得到确认。在100kpc范围内，NGC 253的卫星绝对V波段等级MV < -7。在构建卫星亮度函数上，NGC 253的结果与其他局部星系进行了比较。研究还发现了卫星数和星形成比例与宿主恒星质量、环境和形态之间的关系，指向卫星形成的复杂模式。 <div>
We have conducted a systematic search around the Milky Way (MW) analog NGC 253 (D = 3.5 Mpc), as a part of the Panoramic Imaging Survey of Centaurus and Sculptor (PISCeS)—a Magellan+Megacam survey to identify dwarfs and other substructures in resolved stellar light around MW-mass galaxies outside of the Local Group. In total, NGC 253 has five satellites identified by PISCeS within 100 kpc with an absolute V-band magnitude of MV < −7. We have additionally obtained deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging of four reported candidates beyond the survey footprint: Do III, Do IV, and dw0036m2828 are confirmed to be satellites of NGC 253, while SculptorSR is found to be a background galaxy. We find no convincing evidence for the presence of a plane of satellites surrounding NGC 253. We construct its satellite luminosity function, which is complete down to MV ≲ −8 out to 100 kpc and MV ≲ −9 out to 300 kpc, and compare it to those calculated for other Local Volume galaxies. Exploring trends in satellite counts and star-forming fractions among satellite systems, we find relationships with host stellar mass, environment, and morphology, pointing to a complex picture of satellite formation, and a successful model has to reproduce all of these trends.

总结: 该研究利用IRIS仪器对太阳安静区域进行光谱观测，研究了波的传播。分析了不同大气层中形成的各种光谱线，如光球层、色球层和过渡区。通过对安静太阳不同位置的多普勒速度时间序列进行统计分析，得出了主导的振荡周期。结果显示，光球层主要以5分钟周期为主，而色球层主要与3分钟振荡周期相关。在过渡区，观察到多种振荡周期，其中以3、8和12分钟为主。通过推断不同温度下形成的不同大气层中光谱线对的多普勒速度时间序列之间的相位差，我们估计了截止频率。结果显示，在过渡区有3分钟周期与光球层振荡有显著相关性，表明这些振荡可能是从光球层向过渡区传播的。此外，分析了色球层振荡和光球层振荡之间的相位差，表明只有3分钟的振荡向上传播。根据统计分析结果，我们提出了太阳大气中存在磁声波，其中一些是从下向上传播，而另一些是向下传播。过渡区包含了在此处产生的长周期振荡和一些能够从下方到达的光球振动。<br /><br /> <div>
In this analysis, we use spectroscopic observations of the quiet Sun made by the IRIS instrument and investigate wave propagation. We analyze various spectral lines formed in different atmospheric layers, such as the photosphere, chromosphere, and transition region. We examine the Doppler velocity time series at various locations in the quiet Sun to determine the dominant oscillation periods. Our results executing statistical analysis resemble those of the classical physical scenario, indicating that the photosphere is mainly characterized by the dominant 5 minute period, while the chromosphere is primarily associated with the 3 minute oscillation period. In the transition region, we observe a variety of oscillation periods, with dominant periods of 3, 8, and 12 minutes. We estimate the cutoff frequency by deducing the phase difference between two Doppler velocity time series obtained from spectral line pairs in different atmospheric layers formed at different temperatures. This reveals a significant correlation between 3 minute periods in the transition region and photospheric oscillations, suggesting that these oscillations in the transition region might propagate from the photosphere. Additionally, we analyze the phase difference between chromospheric oscillations and photospheric oscillations, demonstrating that only the 3 minute oscillations propagate upward. Based on the statistical analyses, we suggest the presence of magnetoacoustic waves in the solar atmosphere, some of which are propagating from the lower solar atmosphere upward, while some others are propagating downward. The transition region carries both long-period oscillations generated in situ and some photospheric oscillations that are also able to reach there from below.

本文讨论了对能量大于1017 eV的中微子进行搜索的活跃追求。提到了银河系气体与超银河宇宙射线的相互作用确保了能量通量的保底水平为1018 eV。同时，作者还提出了宇宙射线产生的中微子通量的普遍估计，这一通量通常超过保底水平。然而，要想探测到能量大于1018 eV的中微子仍具有挑战性，除非质子加速到最高能量是在某些次要的宇宙射线源中发生，或者存在某些新的物理现象。 <div>
The search for neutrinos with energies greater than 1017 eV is being actively pursued. Although normalization of the dominant neutrino flux is highly uncertain, a floor level is guaranteed by the interactions of extragalactic cosmic rays with milky Way gas. We estimate that this floor level gives an energy flux of at 1018 eV, where uncertainties arise from the modeling of the gas distribution and the experimental determination of the mass composition of ultra–high-energy cosmic rays on Earth. Based on a minimal model of cosmic-ray production to explain the mass-discriminated energy spectra observed on Earth above 5 × 1018 eV, we also present generic estimates of the neutrino fluxes expected from extragalactic production that generally exceed the aforementioned guaranteed floor. The prospects for detecting neutrinos above 1018 eV remain challenging, however, unless proton acceleration to the highest energies is at play in a subdominant population of cosmic-ray sources or new physical phenomena are at work.

<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了小行星形成模型，发现从原行星盘的雪线外迁移的小行星可能含有富含水冰的核心，也就是所谓的水世界。观测结果提示存在这样的水世界，但无法确认行星核心的具体组成。研究者使用不同的形成模型和大气逸失模型来模拟与观测结果一致的行星系统，并发现大约10%的裸行星（即没有原始H/He大气的行星）可能在G型恒星周围富含水冰，而在M型恒星周围可能达到20%。然而，大多数水世界被预测位于10天以上的轨道周期上。这意味着通过径向速度和透射光谱学识别水世界可能在针对具有更长轨道周期的行星时更有成功的可能性。 <div>
Planet formation models suggest that the small exoplanets that migrate from beyond the snowline of the protoplanetary disk likely contain water-ice-rich cores (∼50% by mass), also known as water worlds. While the observed radius valley of the Kepler planets is well explained by the atmospheric dichotomy of the rocky planets, precise measurements of the mass and radius of the transiting planets hint at the existence of these water worlds. However, observations cannot confirm the core compositions of those planets, owing to the degeneracy between the density of a bare water-ice-rich planet and the bulk density of a rocky planet with a thin atmosphere. We combine different formation models from the Genesis library with atmospheric escape models, such as photoevaporation and impact stripping, to simulate planetary systems consistent with the observed radius valley. We then explore the possibility of water worlds being present in the currently observed sample by comparing them with simulated planets in the mass–radius–orbital period space. We find that the migration models suggest ≳10% and ≳20% of the bare planets, i.e., planets without primordial H/He atmospheres, to be water-ice-rich around G- and M-type host stars, respectively, consistent with the mass–radius distributions of the observed planets. However, most of the water worlds are predicted to be outside a period of 10 days. A unique identification of water worlds through radial velocity and transmission spectroscopy is likely to be more successful when targeting such planets with longer orbital periods.

Reports on the detection of carbonates in planetary nebulae (PNe) and protostars have suggested the existence of a mechanism that produces these compounds in stellar winds and outflows. A subsequent laboratory study has reported a possible mechanism by presenting the non-thermodynamic-equilibrium (TE), gas-phase condensation of amorphous silicate grains with amorphous calcium carbonate inclusions. The authors concluded that water vapor was necessary for the formation of the carbonates. We present a laboratory study with pulsed laser ablation of a MgSi target in O2 and CO2 gases and report, in the absence of water vapor, the non-TE, gas-phase condensation of amorphous carbonated magnesium silicate dust. It consists of amorphous silicate grains with the formula MgSiO3, which comprise carbonate groups homogeneously dispersed in their structure. The IR spectra of the grains show the characteristic bands of amorphous silicates and two bands at ∼6.3 and ∼7.0 μm, which we assign to the carbonate groups. The silicate bands are not significantly affected at an estimated Si:C ratio of 9:1–9:2. Such grains could form in winds and outflows of evolved stars and PNe if C atoms are present during silicate condensation. Additionally, we find that Lyα radiation dissociates the carbonate groups at the surface of the carbonated silicate grains and we estimate the corresponding photodissociation cross section of (0.04 ± 0.02) ×10−16 cm2. Therefore, photodissociation would limit the formation of carbonate groups on grains in winds and outflows of stars emitting vacuum ultraviolet photons, and the carbonates observed in protostars have not formed by gas-phase condensation.

In 2023 December, the Fermi Large Area Telescope Catalog announced the discovery of 33 new millisecond pulsars. Motivated by that, in this work, I study how different values of the symmetry energy slope (L) affect the properties of static and slowly rotating neutron stars. For fixed values of angular velocity, I study how the slope influences the increase of the maximum mass, the radii of the canonical 1.4 M⊙, its eccentricity, as well the same quantities for the 2.01 M⊙ stars. I show that different slope values cause different variations not only in the absolute quantities but also in relative ones. Indeed, different slope values predict different values for the eccentricity, which does not depend on the absolute value of the neutron stars’ radii. Therefore, this quantity can be a powerful tool to constrain the symmetry energy slope.

Turbulent radiative mixing layers play an important role in many astrophysical contexts where cool (≲104 K) clouds interact with hot flows (e.g., galactic winds, high-velocity clouds, infalling satellites in halos and clusters). The fate of these clouds (as well as many of their observable properties) is dictated by the competition between turbulence and radiative cooling; however, turbulence in these multiphase flows remains poorly understood. We have investigated the emergent turbulence arising in the interaction between clouds and supersonic winds in hydrodynamic enzo-e simulations. In order to obtain robust results, we employed multiple metrics to characterize the turbulent velocity, vturb. We find four primary results when cooling is sufficient for cloud survival. First, vturb manifests clear temperature dependence. Initially, vturb roughly matches the scaling of sound speed on temperature. In gas hotter than the temperature where cooling peaks, this dependence weakens with time until vturb is constant. Second, the relative velocity between the cloud and wind initially drives rapid growth of vturb. As it drops (from entrainment), vturb starts to decay before it stabilizes at roughly half its maximum. At late times, cooling flows appear to support turbulence. Third, the magnitude of vturb scales with the ratio between the hot phase sound-crossing time and the minimum cooling time. Finally, we find tentative evidence for a length scale associated with resolving turbulence. Underresolving this scale may cause violent shattering and affect the cloud’s large-scale morphological properties.

<div> Tidal torques, spins, rotating systems, synchronization traps, inertial waves
<br /><br />总结: 本文讨论了潮汐力对于星体和行星自转的影响，特别是在偏心轨道系统中。在这种系统中，潮汐力驱动惯性振荡，导致了一系列稳定的“同步陷阱”，使得自转周期与轨道周期的比值偏离了传统的假同步预期。这一机制类似于潮汐共振锁定，但不需要推动振荡模式的非线性增长。同步陷阱可能会解释观测到的自转速率与假同步或同步预期不符的低质量恒星和热木星现象。 <div>
Tidal torques can alter the spins of tidally interacting stars and planets, usually over shorter timescales than the tidal damping of orbital separations or eccentricities. Simple tidal models predict that, in eccentric binary or planetary systems, rotation periods will evolve toward a “pseudosynchronous” ratio with the orbital period. However, this prediction does not account for “inertial” waves that are present in stars or gaseous planets with (i) convective envelopes and (ii) even very slow rotation. We demonstrate that tidal driving of inertial oscillations in eccentric systems generically produces a network of stable “synchronization traps” at ratios of orbital to rotation period that are simple to predict but can deviate significantly from pseudosynchronization. The mechanism underlying spin synchronization trapping is similar to tidal resonance locking, involving a balance between torques that is maintained automatically by the scaling of inertial mode frequencies with the rotation rate. In contrast with many resonance locking scenarios, however, the torque balance required for synchronization trapping need not drive mode amplitudes to nonlinearity. Synchronization traps may provide an explanation for low-mass stars and hot Jupiters with observed rotation rates that deviate from pseudosynchronous or synchronous expectations.

FRB 121102A和FRB 190520B的快速射电爆发是与紧凑持续的射电辐射空间相关的。研究采用了参数化的一区域模型，表明脉冲星的相对论磁化风吹扫其周围，并导致前向冲击波和终止冲击波之间的电子的幂律分布。并且经过对模型参数的适当调整，得出了能够很好地拟合观测光谱的一区域模型的同步辐射射电发射性质。通过模型的动力学演化，我们还可以得到时间变化的相关性质。这种参数化模型不依赖于具体的物理模型，而是可以通过参数和观测结果的比较来约束物理模型，从而揭示了关于中心引擎和周围环境的信息。我们还讨论了我们的场景中的同步辐射自康普顿辐射，但发现没有关于其他波段的对应物。 <div>
The repeated fast radio bursts FRB 121102A and FRB 190520B have been reported, along with a spatially coincident, compact, persistent radio emission. In this paper, we present a parameterized one-zone model, with the basic scenario that a relativistic magnetized wind from the pulsar sweeps up the surroundings, e.g., freely expanding supernova ejecta, giving rise to a power-law distribution of electrons between the forward shock and the termination shock. We show that via appropriate adjustment of the model parameters, we can obtain synchrotron radio emission properties from the one-zone model bright enough to account for the observation, simply and analytically fitting the observed spectra well. Through dynamical evolution of the model, we can also obtain time-varying relevant properties. This parameterized model does not depend on concrete physical models such as a central engine; instead, we can constraint the physical model via comparison between parameters and observations, indicating the information about the central engine and surroundings. We also discuss the synchrotron self-Compton emission in our scenario in the end but find no clue about the counterparts at other wave bands.

该研究调查了W28 (G6.4−0.1) 原型相互作用型超新星遗迹与周围分子云的相互作用。研究使用HCO+，和HNC J = 1–0线的新观测数据，以及CO同位素、N2H+和H13CO+的存档数据。在比较不同分子物质的空间分布和谱线轮廓后，研究得出了HCO+/CO的丰度比约为10−4，这比未受震激的云中的值高出一个数量级。这可以通过来自观测的物理参数加以解释：预激波密度nH约为2 × 105 cm−3，CR 电离率ζ = 2.5 × 10−15 s−1，激波速度Vs = 15–20 km s−1。在W28东北边界之外的一个点上，估算出了N(HCO+)/N(N2H+)的丰度比约为0.6–3.3，如果采用高密度nH ∼ 2 × 105 cm−3，这可以通过化学模拟重现。 <br /><br />总结: <br />该研究使用多种分子观测数据，探讨了超新星遗迹与分子云的相互作用，发现震波和宇宙射线对分子云化学产生影响，为研究星际介质的演化提供了有益信息。 <div>
Supernova remnants (SNRs) exert a strong influence on the physics and chemistry of the nearby molecular clouds through shock waves and the cosmic rays (CRs) they accelerate. To investigate the SNR–cloud interaction in the prototype interacting SNR W28 (G6.4−0.1), we present new observations of the HCO+, , and HNC J = 1–0 lines, supplemented by archival data of CO isotopes, N2H+ and H13CO+. We compare the spatial distribution and spectral line profiles of different molecular species. Using the local thermodynamic equilibrium assumption, we obtain an abundance ratio of N(HCO+)/N(CO) ∼10−4 in the northeastern shocked cloud, which is higher by an order of magnitude than the values in unshocked clouds. This can be accounted for by the chemistry jointly induced by shock and CRs, with the physical parameters previously obtained from observations: preshock density nH ∼ 2 × 105 cm−3, CR ionization rate ζ = 2.5 × 10−15 s−1, and shock velocity Vs = 15–20 km s−1. Toward a point outside the northeastern boundary of W28 with a known high CR ionization rate, we estimate the abundance ratio N(HCO+)/N(N2H+) ≈ 0.6–3.3, which can be reproduced by a chemical simulation if a high density nH ∼ 2 × 105 cm−3 is adopted.

这篇文章介绍了β粒子在弱电离等离子体背景中与原子核发生碰撞从而促进中子星并合引发的重要机制。作者利用Inokuti的快速粒子碰撞核的近似实现了Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann方程的光谱求解器。具体而言，他们将快速粒子平面波原子激发核展开为Hermite基函数的系数，并得出了相关离散光谱系统。在这种快速粒子极限下，该方法允许直接使用光谱矩阵，包括通常应用于光子-物质相互作用的光学振子强度。他们在MASS-APP光谱求解器框架中实现了这个光谱矩阵，避免了每个空间区域的完整矩阵存储。他们对矩阵构建的各个方面进行了数值验证，并进行了一个二维轴对称的Kilonova喷射快照的三维模拟验证。他们的初步数值结果表明，在Kilonova中，对β粒子合理的Hermite基函数参数选择是：速度参数u = 0，热速度参数α = 0.5c，以及一个9×9×9模式速度基函数集（每个维度的Hermite阶数为0-8）。对于内部喷射样本区域，作者估计大角度（≳2.°5）束缚激发散射导致的热化比例约为0.002-0.003。

The interaction of β-particles with the weakly ionized plasma background is an important mechanism for powering the kilonova (KN) transient signal from neutron star mergers. For this purpose, we present an implementation of the approximate fast-particle collision kernel, described by Inokuti following the seminal formulation of Bethe, in a spectral solver of the Vlasov–Maxwell–Boltzmann equation. In particular, we expand the fast-particle plane-wave atomic excitation kernel into coefficients of the Hermite basis, and derive the relevant discrete spectral system. In this fast-particle limit, the approach permits the direct use of atomic data, including optical oscillator strengths, normally applied to photon–matter interaction. The resulting spectral matrix is implemented in the MASS-APP spectral solver framework, in a way that avoids full matrix storage per spatial zone. We numerically verify aspects of the matrix construction, and present a proof-of-principle 3D simulation of a 2D axisymmetric KN ejecta snapshot. Our preliminary numerical results indicate that a reasonable choice of Hermite basis parameters for β-particles in the KN is a bulk velocity parameter u = 0, a thermal velocity parameter α = 0.5c, and a 9 × 9 × 9 mode velocity basis set (Hermite orders of 0–8 in each dimension). For interior-ejecta sample zones, we estimate that the ratio of thermalization from large-angle (≳2.°5) bound excitation scattering to total thermalization is ∼0.002–0.003.

<br />
利用JWST/NIRCam测量了EIGER项目中5.9 < z < 7.1的六个类星体宿主星系和超大质量黑洞（SMBH）质量。我们获得了F115W、F200W和F356W波段的深度NIRCam成像，以及几个类星体的F356W棱镜光谱。我们利用明亮非饱和的恒星构建了点扩散函数（PSF）模型，并估计了这些PSF的误差。然后，通过将类星体图像拟合为点源加指数盘，测量或限制了类星体的荧光和形态。我们成功探测到了三个类星体，其宿主与类星的荧光比约为1%–5%。光谱能量分布拟合表明，这些类星体宿主星系的恒星质量为M* ≳ 1010M⊙。对于无法检测到宿主星系的类星体，我们估计了它们的恒星质量上限。我们使用棱镜光谱测量了Hβ线剖面和连续光度，然后估计了类星体的SMBH质量。我们的结果表明，在红移z ≳ 6时，宿主星系质量和SMBH质量之间存在着正相关关系。我们的样本中的类星体显示出较高的BH-to-stellar-mass比值，MBH/M* ∼ 0.15，比本地关系高出约2 dex。我们发现，选择效应只部分地导致了高红移类星体的高MBH/M*比率。这一结果暗示了MBH-M*关系可能存在红移演化。<br /><br />总结: 本研究利用JWST/NIRCam对EIGER项目中6个红移在5.9 < z < 7.1的类星体进行了观测。其中成功探测到3个类星体的宿主星系，这些宿主星系的恒星质量约为M* ≳ 1010M⊙。通过测量Hβ线剖面和连续光度，我们估计了类星体的SMBH质量。研究结果表明，红移z ≳ 6时，宿主星系质量和SMBH质量之间存在正相关关系。与本地关系相比，我们的样本显示出较高的BH-to-stellar-mass比值，MBH/M* ∼ 0.15，这可能暗示了MBH-M*关系存在红移演化。 <div>
We report JWST/NIRCam measurements of quasar host galaxy emissions and supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses for six quasars at 5.9 < z < 7.1 in the Emission-line galaxies and Intergalactic Gas in the Epoch of Reionization (EIGER) project. We obtain deep NIRCam imaging in the F115W, F200W, and F356W bands, as well as F356W grism spectroscopy of the quasars. We use bright unsaturated stars to construct models of the point-spread functions (PSFs) and estimate the errors of these PSFs. We then measure or constrain the fluxes and morphology of the quasar host galaxies by fitting the quasar images as a point source plus an exponential disk. We successfully detect the host galaxies of three quasars, which have host-to-quasar-flux ratios of ∼1%–5%. Spectral energy distribution fitting suggests that these quasar host galaxies have stellar masses of M* ≳ 1010M⊙. For quasars with host galaxy nondetections, we estimate the upper limits of their stellar masses. We use the grism spectra to measure the Hβ line profile and the continuum luminosity, then estimate the SMBH masses for the quasars. Our results indicate that the positive relation between SMBH masses and host galaxy stellar masses already exists at redshift z ≳ 6. The quasars in our sample show a high BH-to-stellar-mass ratio of MBH/M* ∼ 0.15, which is about ∼2 dex higher than local relations. We find that selection effects only contribute partially to the high MBH/M* ratios of high-redshift quasars. This result hints at a possible redshift evolution of the MBH–M* relation.

<br /><br />总结:
研究使用James Webb Space Telescope发现了高红移下低光度活跃星系核的存在，并对这些天体的核心黑洞质量进行了估算。这一发现拓展了庞大黑洞种群的初始质量分布的研究范围。论文着重从紫外至光学波段的恒星潮撕裂事件入手，探讨了这一工具在研究质量小于10^4-6M⊙的黑洞种群方面的应用。研究估算了在高红移z = 4–11范围内与JWST检测的AGN宿主星系属性相关的TDE率，并认为JWST和Roman Space Telescope可以探测和识别高达z ≃ 4–7的TDE。预测了在高红移z > 4范围内JWST和Roman Space Telescope在1年内可以观测和发现的TDE数量。进一步讨论了与Vera C. Rubin Observatory联合观测的调查策略，以提高高红移TDE的检测数量。高红移TDE的研究将为我们提供探索早期黑洞种群质量分布的独特机会。 <div>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently uncovered the presence of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at z = 4–11. Spectroscopic observations have provided estimates of the nuclear black hole (BH) masses for these sources, extending the low-mass boundary down to M• ∼ 106–7M⊙. Despite this breakthrough, the observed lowest mass of BHs is still ≳1–2 orders of magnitude heavier than the predicted mass range of their seed population, thereby leaving the initial mass distribution of massive BHs poorly constrained. In this paper, we focus on UV-to-optical (in the rest frame) flares of stellar tidal disruption events (TDEs) embedded in low-luminosity AGNs as a tool for exploring low-mass BH populations with ≲104–6M⊙. We provide an estimate of the TDE rate over z = 4–11, associated with the properties of JWST-detected AGN host galaxies, and we find that deep and wide survey programs with JWST and the Roman Space Telescope (RST) can detect and identify TDEs up to z ≃ 4–7. The predicted detection numbers of TDEs at z > 4 in 1 yr are for the JADES-Medium (and COSMOS-Web) survey with JWST and for the deep (and wide) tiers of the High Latitude Time Domain Survey with RST. We further discuss survey strategies for hunting for transient high-redshift TDEs in wide-field surveys with RST, as well as a joint observation campaign with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory for enhancing the detection number. The high-redshift TDE search will give us a unique opportunity to probe the mass distribution of early BH populations.

总结: 
红巨星分支尖端(TRGB)方法在I波段是测量近距离星系距离最有效和精确的技术之一。同时，近红外的TRGB比I波段亮1-2个数量级，有扩大测量星系距离范围的潜力。通过对8个近邻星系的12个区域进行HST成像，我们建立了WFC3/IR F110W和F160W滤光片下TRGB的基准和颜色校正。这项新的校准精度大约为F814W TRGB距离的1%。我们通过验证发现，使用近红外TRGB校准后的距离模数与使用F814W TRGB确定的距离模数一致。这项工作将直接为我们在JWST NIRCam和NIRISS光度滤波器中校准TRGB提供重要信息。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
The tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) based distance method in the I band is one of the most efficient and precise techniques for measuring distances to nearby galaxies (D ≲ 15 Mpc). The TRGB in the near-infrared (NIR) is 1–2 mag brighter relative to the I band, and has the potential to expand the range over which distance measurements to nearby galaxies are feasible. Using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of 12 fields in eight nearby galaxies, we determine color-based corrections and zero-points of the TRGB in the Wide Field Camera 3 IR (WFC3/IR) F110W and F160W filters. First, we measure TRGB distances in the I band equivalent Advanced Camera System (ACS) F814W filter from resolved stellar populations with the HST. The TRGB in the ACS F814W filter is used for our distance anchor and to place the WFC3/IR magnitudes on an absolute scale. We then determine the color dependence (a proxy for metallicity/age) and zero-point of the NIR TRGB from photometry of WFC3/IR fields that overlap with the ACS fields. The new calibration is accurate to ∼1% in distance relative to the F814W TRGB. Validating the accuracy of the calibrations, we find that the distance modulus for each field using the NIR TRGB calibration agrees with the distance modulus of the same field as determined from the F814W TRGB. This is a JWST preparatory program, and the work done here will directly inform our approach to calibrating the TRGB in JWST NIRCam and NIRISS photometric filters.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究对来自LAMOST和Subaru的352颗VMP星进行了化学动力学分析。利用友好聚类算法，将5778颗VMP星分为131个动力学标记组，其中89个与银河中已知的次结构相关。研究发现VMPD的锌丰度较低，可能是小型恒星系统的遗迹；Sequoia显示出适度高的r-过程丰度；Helmi流域的碳和轻中子俘获元素缺陷；VMPD和Helmi流域中碳富集金属贫困星的比例较低；GSE中的一个子群显示出很高的r-过程富集星的比例。此外，对丰度比和动力学的大尺度相关性研究并未发现明显的相关性。 <div>
Very metal-poor (VMP) stars record the signatures of early accreted galaxies, making them essential tools for unraveling the early stages of Galaxy formation. Understanding the origin of VMP stars requires comprehensive studies of their chemical compositions and kinematics, which are currently lacking. Hence, we conduct a chemodynamical analysis of 352 VMP stars selected from one of the largest uniform high-resolution VMP star samples, jointly obtained from LAMOST and Subaru. We apply a friends-of-friends clustering algorithm to the master catalog of this high-resolution sample, which consists of 5778 VMP stars. It results in 131 dynamically tagged groups with 89 associated with known substructures in the Milky Way, including Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), Thamnos, Helmi streams, Sequoia, Wukong, Pontus, and the very metal-poor disk (VMPD). Our findings are: (i) the VMPD shows lower Zn abundances than the rest, which indicates that it could be a relic of small stellar systems; (ii) Sequoia shows moderately high r-process abundances; (iii) Helmi streams show deficiencies in carbon and light neutron-capture elements; (iv) the fraction of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars with no enhancement in heavy elements (CEMP-no stars) seems low in the VMPD and the Helmi streams; and (v) a subgroup in GSE exhibits a very high fraction of r-process enhanced stars, with four out of five showing [Eu/Fe]> +1.0. The abundance patterns of other elements in VMP substructures largely match the whole VMP sample. We also study large-scale correlations between abundance ratios and kinematics without classifying stars into substructures, but it does not yield significant correlations once the overall chemical evolution is considered for most elements.

Magnetized plasma columns and extended magnetic structures with both footpoints anchored to a surface layer are an important building block of astrophysical dissipation models. Current loops shining in X-rays during the growth of plasma instabilities are observed in the corona of the Sun and are expected to exist in highly magnetized neutron star magnetospheres and accretion disk coronae. For varying twist and system sizes, we investigate the stability of line-tied force-free flux tubes and the dissipation of twist energy during instabilities using linear analysis and time-dependent force-free electrodynamics simulations. Kink modes (m = 1) and efficient magnetic energy dissipation develop for plasma safety factors q ≲ 1, where q is the inverse of the number of magnetic field line windings per column length. Higher-order fluting modes (m > 1) can distort equilibrium flux tubes for q > 1 but induce significantly less dissipation. In our analysis, the characteristic pitch of flux-tube field lines determines the growth rate ( ) and minimum wavelength of the kink instability ( ). We use these scalings to determine a minimum flux tube length for the growth of the kink instability for any given . By drawing analogies to idealized magnetar magnetospheres with varying regimes of boundary shearing rates, we discuss the expected impact of the pitch-dependent growth rates for magnetospheric dissipation in magnetar conditions.

<div> 星际介质，模拟，金属丰度，星际物质结构，分子氢丰度
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章使用了一套包括辐射传递、分子氢的非平衡模型和实际星际物质形成及反馈的流体力学模拟，研究了星系盘内星际介质的结构和H2丰度与局部星际物质性质的关系。研究发现，金属丰度对星际物质的结构和星形成速率有很大影响，随着金属丰度的降低，密度分布变得越来越平滑。此外，H I–H2转变密度随金属丰度降低而向更高密度的方向漂移，而在Z≲ 0.2 Z⊙时，星际介质中达到的分子比例急剧下降。研究提出了关于气态金属丰度、紫外辐射场和气体密度的精确拟合公式，并且在模拟星系的小区域内，该公式对整个金属丰度和尺度范围内的分子气体质量的预测误差都在1.5倍以内。此外，该拟合公式在低金属丰度范围内比以往的模型更为准确，可用于模拟低分辨率和半解析星系形成模型中的分子气体。 <div>
We use a suite of hydrodynamics simulations of the interstellar medium (ISM) within a galactic disk, which includes radiative transfer, a nonequilibrium model of molecular hydrogen, and a realistic model for star formation and feedback, to study the structure of the ISM and H2 abundance as a function of local ISM properties. We show that the star formation rate and structure of the ISM are sensitive to the metallicity of the gas with a progressively smoother density distribution with decreasing metallicity. In addition to the well-known trend of the H I–H2 transition shifting to higher densities with decreasing metallicity, the maximum achieved molecular fraction in the ISM drops drastically at Z ≲ 0.2 Z⊙ as the formation time of H2 becomes much longer than a typical lifetime of dense regions of the ISM. We present accurate fitting formulae for both volumetric and projected measured on different scales as a function of gas metallicity, UV radiation field, and gas density. We show that when the formulae are applied to the patches in the simulated galaxy, the overall molecular gas mass is reproduced to better than a factor of ≲1.5 across the entire range of metallicities and scales. We also show that the presented fit is considerably more accurate than any of the previous models and fitting formulae in the low-metallicity regime. The fit can thus be used for modeling molecular gas in low-resolution simulations and semi-analytic models of galaxy formation in the dwarf and high-redshift regimes.

总结:
高质量恒星形成的早期阶段破碎对于理解高质量星团的形成至关重要。通过Atacama大型毫米/亚毫米阵列70μm暗高质量物质团（ASHES）调查，我们对39个高质量星形成团中的破碎进行了调查。通过对连续发射的核心进行估计，发现了839个核心的平均间距在0.08至0.32 pc之间。我们发现观察到的核心间距和质量与热力学Jeans长度和质量相符。我们还发现了7m阵列连续发射所揭示的次团结构。将物质团和次团密度的Jeans参数与引力束缚核心的间距和质量进行比较，暗示了物质团的破碎，表明了在阶层破碎的过程中次团和核心的同时形成。每个物质团中核心的数量与物质团表面密度呈正相关，与热力学Jeans破碎所预期的数量也一致。我们还发现，原恒星核心的分数越高，核心质量的动态范围就越大，表明了随着物质团演化，核心的质量在增长。ASHES样本呈现出不同的破裂模式：排列，分散，聚类和次聚类。最后，通过参数，可以帮助区分核心分布的中心浓缩和次聚类，我们发现在高质量恒星形成的早期演化阶段，核心倾向于遵循次聚类分布。 <div>
Fragmentation during the early stages of high-mass star formation is crucial for understanding the formation of high-mass clusters. We investigated fragmentation within 39 high-mass star-forming clumps as part of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Survey of 70 μm Dark High-mass Clumps in Early Stages (ASHES) survey. Considering projection effects, we have estimated core separations for 839 cores identified from the continuum emission and found mean values between 0.08 and 0.32 pc within each clump. We find compatibility of the observed core separations and masses with the thermal Jeans length and mass, respectively. We also present subclump structures revealed by the 7 m array continuum emission. Comparison of the Jeans parameters using clump and subclump densities with the separation and masses of gravitationally bound cores suggests that they can be explained by clump fragmentation, implying the simultaneous formation of subclumps and cores within rather than a step-by-step hierarchical fragmentation. The number of cores in each clump positively correlates with the clump surface density and the number expected from the thermal Jeans fragmentation. We also find that the higher the fraction of protostellar cores, the larger the dynamic range of the core mass, implying that the cores are growing in mass as the clump evolves. The ASHES sample exhibits various fragmentation patterns: aligned, scattered, clustered, and subclustered. Using the -parameter, which can help distinguish between centrally condensed and subclustered spatial core distributions, we finally find that in the early evolutionary stages of high-mass star formation, cores tend to follow a subclustered distribution.

We present ionizing spectra estimated at 13.6–100 eV for 10 dwarf galaxies with strong high-ionization lines of He ii λ4686 and [Ne v] λ3426 ([Ne iv] λ2424) at z = 0 (z = 8) that are identified in our Keck/LRIS spectroscopy and the literature (the JWST Early Release Observations program). With the flux ratios of these high-ionization lines and >10 low-ionization lines of hydrogen, helium, oxygen, neon, and sulfur, we determine ionizing spectra consisting of stellar and nonthermal power-law radiation by photoionization modeling with free parameters of nebular properties, including metallicity and ionization parameter, canceling out abundance ratio differences. We find that all of the observed flux ratios are well reproduced by the photoionization models with the power-law index αEUV of αEUV ∼ (–1) − 0 and the luminosity LEUV of LEUV ∼ 1040–1042 erg s−1 at ∼55–100 eV for six galaxies, while four galaxies include large systematics in αEUV caused by stellar radiation contamination. We then compare αEUV and LEUV of these six galaxies with those predicted by the black hole (BH) accretion disk models and find that αEUV and LEUV are similar to those of the intermediate-mass BHs (IMBHs) in BH accretion disk models, albeit with possibilities of the other scenarios. Confirming these results with a known IMBH having a mass MBH of MBH = 105.75M⊙, we find that four local galaxies and one z = 7.665 galaxy have ionizing spectra consistent with those of IMBHs with MBH ∼ 103–105M⊙.

<div> 星团，质量函数，Gaia数据，双星系统，初始质量函数

在这项研究中，通过使用Gaia数据第三版数据，采用StarGo机器学习算法确定成员资格，对93个星团的现代质量函数（PDMF）进行了分析。对未解析双星系统对质量估计的影响进行了严格评估，并采用三种质量比率剖面进行校正。PDMF通过稳健的最大似然方法来表征幂律指数α，避免了与数据分箱相关的偏差。我们观察到，对于小于200百万年的星团，α的值在Gaia的完整质量下限（平均为0.3 M⊙）和2 M⊙之间的恒定，而对于更老的星团，特别是考虑半质量半径内的恒星时，α则逐渐减小。这些星团的PDMF与通过失去低质星形成的Kroupa初始质量函数一致。星团的形态与α呈相关性，α值表现出从纤维状到潮尾星团的递减趋势，与星团年龄递增的顺序相一致。α对总星团质量的依赖性较弱，尤其在半质量半径外，高质量星团的α值略有增加。我们没有观察到α与星团的平均金属丰度之间的相关性。年轻星团的金属丰度比其较老的对应物低，这表明较老的星团可能已从内盘迁移到了太阳附近。与包含黑洞群体的数值模型的比较表明，需要观测遥远、年龄较大的大质量敞开星团，以确定它们是否含有黑洞。<br /><br />总结: 该研究分析了93个星团的现代质量函数，发现了PDMF的指数α与星团年龄和形态之间的关联性，以及与金属丰度的关系。研究结果还表明，有必要观测远处、年龄较大的大质量敞开星团，以确定它们是否包含黑洞。 <div>
This work analyzes the present-day mass function (PDMF) of 93 star clusters utilizing Gaia Data Release 3 data, with membership determined by the StarGo machine-learning algorithm. The impact of unresolved binary systems on mass estimation is rigorously assessed, adopting three mass ratio profiles for correction. The PDMF is characterized by the power-law index, α, derived through a robust maximum likelihood method that avoids biases associated with data binning. The value of α for stars between the completeness limited mass of Gaia (with a mean 0.3 M⊙ for our cluster samples) and 2 M⊙ exhibits stability for clusters younger than 200 Myr, decreasing for older clusters, particularly when considering stars within the half-mass radius. The PDMF of these star clusters is consistent with a dynamically evolved Kroupa initial mass function via the loss of low-mass stars. Cluster morphology shows a correlation with α, as α values exhibit a decreasing trend from filamentary to tidal-tail clusters, mirroring the sequence of increasing cluster age. The dependence of α on the total cluster mass is weak, with a subtle increase for higher-mass clusters, especially outside the half-mass radius. We do not observe a correlation between α and the mean metallicity of the clusters. Younger clusters have lower metallicity compared to their older counterparts, which indicates that the older clusters might have migrated to the solar neighborhood from the inner disk. A comparison with numerical models incorporating a black hole population suggests the need for observations of distant, older, massive open clusters to determine whether or not they contain black holes.

这篇研究调查了118个早型星系的球状星团（GC）系统的大小和结构。研究发现，无论在整个星系质量范围内（108.3M⊙ < M* < 1011.6M⊙），GC系统都比宿主星系的有效半径（Re,gc）大2-4倍。此外，Re,gc和星系恒星质量之间的关系在恒星质量为Mp ≃ 1010.8时出现了“拐点”，类似于星系Re-恒星质量关系。研究还对传统的蓝色和红色GC颜色亚群进行了新的描述，发现红色Δgi的GC群体甚至在矮星系中也有两倍于恒星的扩展性。此外，还发现了Re,gc与GC总数之间存在紧密的关联，并发现环境对Re,gc的影响，密度较低的环境下GC系统更加扩展。总之，这项研究提供了对于GC系统大小和结构与宿主星系性质和环境关系的关键见解。 
<br /><br />总结: 这项研究调查了早型星系球状星团系统的大小和结构，发现它们比宿主星系更加扩展，且与宿主星系的恒星质量和颜色存在相关性。红色的GC群体在大小上的扩展性是蓝色群体的两倍，GC系统的大小与GC总数之间存在紧密关联，且环境密度对其大小也有影响。 <div>
We study the size and structure of globular cluster (GC) systems of 118 early-type galaxies from the NGVS, MATLAS, and ACSVCS surveys. Fitting Sérsic profiles, we investigate the relationship between effective radii of GC systems (Re,gc) and galaxy properties. GC systems are 2–4 times more extended than host galaxies across the entire stellar mass range of our sample (108.3M⊙ < M* < 1011.6M⊙). The relationship between Re,gc and galaxy stellar mass exhibits a characteristic “knee” at a stellar mass of Mp ≃ 1010.8, similar to the galaxy Re–stellar mass relationship. We present a new characterization of the traditional blue and red GC color subpopulations, describing them with respect to host galaxy color (Δgi): GCs with similar colors to their hosts have a “red” Δgi, and those significantly bluer GCs have a “blue” Δgi. The GC populations with red Δgi, even in dwarf galaxies, are twice as extended as the stars, suggesting that formation or survival mechanisms favor the outer regions. We find a tight correlation between Re,gc and the total number of GCs, with intrinsic scatter ≲0.1 dex spanning two and three orders of magnitude in size and number, respectively. This holds for both red and blue subpopulations, albeit with different slopes. Assuming that NGC,Total correlates with M200, we find that the red GC systems have effective radii of roughly 1%–5% R200, while the blue GC systems in massive galaxies can have sizes as large as ∼10% R200. Environmental dependence on Re,gc is also found, with lower-density environments exhibiting more extended GC systems at fixed mass.

<div> 关键词: 过渡盘，PDS 70系统，内部盘，尘埃和气体耗尽，行星形成

总结:
过渡盘是行星形成后期的一个阶段，其中内部区域缺乏尘埃和气体。研究PDS 70系统时发现，该系统内有两颗巨行星围绕着内部盘空洞轨道运行，至少有一颗正在吸积物质。然而，最让人关注的是系统内部盘区域，因为这是系统过剩红外辐射的主要来源。研究人员通过光学和红外光度学以及光谱学分析表明，内部盘的动态变化时间跨度为数天到数年，尘埃对恒星进行的光学遮挡使其变暗，而3–5 μm的辐射由于盘结构的变化而发生变化。同时，内部区域的红外辐射在约1年的时间内(几乎)消失。研究人员利用一个温暖的(温度≲600 K)扁平盘和一个更热的(1200 K)尘域建立了该系统的光谱能量分布模型，并考虑了其时间变化。内部盘的高尘埃对气体比率意味着此处可能是一个由内区域的碰撞和行星小天体的蒸发产生的尘埃和挥发物质富集的“妖兽”。 <div>
Transition disks, with inner regions depleted in dust and gas, could represent later stages of protoplanetary disk evolution when newly formed planets are emerging. The PDS 70 system has attracted particular interest because of the presence of two giant planets in orbits at tens of astronomical units within the inner disk cavity, at least one of which is itself accreting. However, the region around PDS 70 most relevant to understanding the planet populations revealed by exoplanet surveys of middle-aged stars is the inner disk, which is the dominant source of the system’s excess infrared emission but only marginally resolved by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. Here we present and analyze time-series optical and infrared photometry and spectroscopy that reveal the inner disk to be dynamic on timescales of days to years, with occultation by submicron dust dimming the star at optical wavelengths, and 3–5 μm emission varying due to changes in disk structure. Remarkably, the infrared emission from the innermost region (nearly) disappears for ∼1 yr. We model the spectral energy distribution of the system and its time variation with a flattened warm (T ≲ 600 K) disk and a hotter (1200 K) dust that could represent an inner rim or wall. The high dust-to-gas ratio of the inner disk, relative to material accreting from the outer disk, means that the former could be a chimera consisting of depleted disk gas that is subsequently enriched with dust and volatiles produced by collisions and evaporation of planetesimals in the inner zone.

总结:<br />
研究使用JWST光谱仪对LIRG VV 114的分子振动带进行了详细分析，观测结果表明，在星暴区域探测到了CO的高度激发，而在星系核区域只探测到了较低温度的分子气体。研究认为这表明CO和H2O的平衡条件是通过中红外线激发和振动线来实现的，这为对星系核和星暴区域的电离和辐射传输过程提供了新的理解。 <div>
The enormous increase in mid-IR sensitivity and spatial and spectral resolution provided by the JWST spectrographs enables, for the first time, detailed extragalactic studies of molecular vibrational bands. This opens an entirely new window for the study of the molecular interstellar medium in luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs). We present a detailed analysis of rovibrational bands of gas-phase CO, H2O, C2H2, and HCN toward the heavily obscured eastern nucleus of the LIRG VV 114, as observed by NIRSpec and the medium resolution spectrograph on the Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI MRS). Spectra extracted from apertures of 130 pc in radius show a clear dichotomy between the obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN) and two intense starburst regions. We detect the 2.3 μm CO bandheads, characteristic of cool stellar atmospheres, in the star-forming regions, but not toward the AGN. Surprisingly, at 4.7 μm, we find highly excited CO (Tex ≈ 700–800 K out to at least rotational level J = 27) toward the star-forming regions, but only cooler gas (Tex ≈ 200 K) toward the AGN. We conclude that only mid-infrared pumping through the rovibrational lines can account for the equilibrium conditions found for CO and H2O in the deeply embedded starbursts. Here, the CO bands probe regions with an intense local radiation field inside dusty young massive star clusters or near the most massive young stars. The lack of high-excitation molecular gas toward the AGN is attributed to geometric dilution of the intense radiation from the bright point source. An overview of the relevant excitation and radiative transfer physics is provided in an appendix.

<title>Pinwheel Outflow Induced by Stellar Mass Loss in a Coplanar Triple System</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We develop a physical framework for interpreting complex circumstellar patterns whorled around asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars by investigating stable, coplanar triple systems using hydrodynamic and particle simulations. The introduction of a close tertiary body causes an additional periodic variation in the orbital velocity and trajectory of the AGB star. As a result, the circumstellar outflow builds a fine non-Archimedean spiral pattern superimposed upon the Archimedean spiral produced by the outer binary alone. This fine spiral can be approximated by off-centered circular rings that become tangent to each other at the location of the Archimedean spiral. The superimposed fine pattern fades out relatively quickly as a function of distance from the center of the system, in contrast to the dominant Archimedean spiral pattern, which presents a much slower fractional density decrease with radius. The different rates of radial decrease of the density contrast in the two superimposed patterns, coupled with their different time and spatial scales, lead to an apparent, but illusory radial change in the observed pattern interval, as has been reported, for example, in CW Leo. The function describing the detailed radial dependence of the expansion velocity is different in the two patterns, which may be used to distinguish them. The shape of the circumstellar whorled pattern is further explored as a function of the orbital eccentricity and the inner companion’s mass. Although this study is confined to stable, coplanar triple systems, the results are likely applicable to moderately noncoplanar systems and open interesting avenues for studying noncoplanar systems.

Solar energetic particle (SEP) events are one of the most crucial aspects of space weather that require continuous monitoring and forecasting. Their prediction depends on various factors, including source eruptions. In the present work, we use the Geostationary Solar Energetic Particle data set covering solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. We develop a framework using time-series-based machine-learning (ML) models with the aim of developing robust short-term forecasts by classifying SEP events. For this purpose, we introduce an ensemble learning approach that merges the results from univariate time series of three proton channels (E ≥10, 50, and 100 MeV) and the long-band X-ray flux (1–8 Å) channel from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite missions and analyze their performance. We consider three models, namely, time series forest, supervised time series forest (STSF), and Bag-of-Symbolic Fourier Approximation Symbols. Our study also focuses on understanding and developing confidence in the predictive capabilities of our models. Therefore, we utilize multiple evaluation techniques and metrics. Based on that, we find STSF to perform well in all scenarios. The summary of metrics for the STSF model is as follows: the area under the ROC curve = 0.981, F1-score = 0.960, true skill statistics = 0.919, Heidke skill score = 0.920, Gilbert skill score = 0.852, and Matthew’s correlation coefficient = 0.920. The Brier score loss of the STSF model is 0.077. This work lays the foundation for building near-real-time short-term SEP event predictions using robust ML methods.

A leading candidate for the heating source of chondrules and igneous rims is shock waves. This mechanism generates high relative velocities between chondrules and dust particles. We have investigated the possibility of the chondrule destruction in collisions with dust particles behind a shock wave using a semianalytical treatment. We find that the chondrules are destroyed during melting in collisions. We derive the conditions for the destruction of chondrules and show that the typical size of the observed chondrules satisfies the condition. We suggest that the chondrule formation and rim accretion are different events if they are heated by shock waves.

We present a systematic analysis of the X-ray emission of a sample of 17 optically selected, X-ray-detected tidal disruption events (TDEs) discovered between 2014 and 2021. The X-ray light curves show a diverse range of temporal behaviors, with most sources not following the expected power-law decline. The X-ray spectra are mostly extremely soft and consistent with thermal emission from the innermost region of an accretion disk, which cools as the accretion rate decreases. Three sources show formation of a hard X-ray corona at late times. The spectral energy distribution shape, probed by the ratio (LBB/LX) between the UV/optical and X-ray, shows a wide range of LBB/LX ∈ (0.5, 3000) at early times and converges to disklike values of LBB/LX ∈ (0.5, 10) at late times. We estimate the fraction of optically discovered TDEs with LX ≥ 1042 erg s−1 to be at least 40% and show that X-ray loudness is independent of black hole mass. We argue that distinct disk formation timescales are unlikely to be able to explain the diverse range of X-ray evolution. We combine our sample with X-ray-discovered ones to construct an X-ray luminosity function, best fit by a broken power law, with a break at LX ≈ 1044 erg s−1. We show that there is no dichotomy between optically and X-ray-selected TDEs; instead, there is a continuum of early-time LBB/LX, at least as wide as LBB/LX ∈ (0.1, 3000), with optical/X-ray surveys selecting preferentially, but not exclusively, from the higher/lower end of the distribution. Our findings are consistent with unification models for the overall TDE population.

We collect a sample of 42 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) with Swift UV photometry and well-measured early time light-curve rises and find that 2002es-like and 2003fg-like SNe Ia have different prepeak UV color evolutions compared to normal SNe Ia and other spectroscopic subtypes. Specifically, 2002es-like and 2003fg-like SNe Ia are cleanly separated from other SNe Ia subtypes by UVM2 − UVW1 ≳ 1.0 mag at t = − 10 days relative to B-band maximum. Furthermore, the SNe Ia that exhibit nonmonotonic bumps in their rising light curves, to date, consist solely of 2002es-like and 2003fg-like SNe Ia. We also find that SNe Ia with two-component power-law rises are more luminous than SNe Ia with single-component power-law rises at prepeak epochs. Given the similar UV colors, along with other observational similarities, we discuss a possible progenitor scenario that places 2002es-like and 2003fg-like SNe Ia along a continuum and may explain the unique UV colors, early time bumps, and other observational similarities between these objects. Ultimately, further observations of both subtypes, especially in the near-infrared, are critical for constraining models of these peculiar thermonuclear explosions.

<div> 关键词: Elsässer variable, 太阳风湍流, Parker Solar Probe, 功率谱, 观测约束

总结:
Elsässer variable z−的性质对于理解太阳风湍流起着重要作用。Parker Solar Probe的测量结果显示，在0.1至0.5天文单位范围内，z−的平均谱未显示出低频断点。在频率范围为10^−4–10^−2 Hz，能量在0.1至0.5天文单位范围内出现径向衰减，并在1天文单位附近保持几乎恒定。在1天文单位附近，z−的谱指数逐渐下降至-1.70。此外，∥, ⊥1, 和⊥2分量在场向坐标系中的径向行为与z−的痕迹类似。这些发现为太阳风湍流模型提供了强有力的观测约束。 <br /><br /> <div>
The nature of the Elsässer variable z− plays a significant role in the understanding of solar wind turbulence. The radial spectral evolution of z− observed by the Helios spacecraft suggests that z− has a persistent background spectrum in the low-frequency range from 0.3 to 1 au. However, the radial evolution in the near-Sun solar wind remains unknown. Here we use Parker Solar Probe measurements to analyze the averaged spectra of z− in the slow solar wind from 0.1 to 0.5 au and compare the results with the WIND observations at 1 au. We find that the averaged spectra of z− do not show the low-frequency break at the low-frequency breakpoint on the power spectra of z+, magnetic field, and velocity. The energy in the frequency range of 10−4–10−2 Hz demonstrates a radial decay from 0.1 to 0.5 au and keeps nearly constant to 1 au. The spectral index of z− gradually decreases from −1.27 at 0.1–0.2 au to −1.59 at 0.4–0.5 au and then slowly declines to −1.70 at 1 au. The radial behaviors of the ∥, ⊥1, and ⊥2 components of z− in the field-aligned coordinates are similar to that of the trace of z−. Our findings suggest a faster radial spectral evolution of z− in the near-Sun solar wind and provide strong observational constraints for the solar wind turbulence model.

The polytropic index is a fundamental physical parameter related to the thermodynamic processes present in space and astrophysical plasmas. This paper investigates the theoretical relationship between the polytropic index and the temperature anisotropy for flow parameters relevant to space plasmas. The derivation is based on the Chew–Goldberger–Low double-adiabatic equations of state and the finite Larmor radius correction. On the basis of this, we present the polytropic index relation, taking into account the temperature anisotropy, flow speed, and magnetic field of the plasma. This relation was further analyzed for the limit of the quasi-parallel and quasi-transversal cases. The quasi-transversal limit gives a polytropic index as a function of the anisotropic temperature γ = 1 + 2[2T⊥ − T∥]/[2T⊥ + T∥]. Using this result, we analyze the polytropic index for the bulk proton parameters derived from Ulysses spacecraft data spanning the interval from 1992 January 1 to 2009 June 30, and we find an average polytropic index of γ ∼ 1.43. This value is close to that of recently published results. However, unlike previous statistical studies, this research computes the polytropic index without relying on power-law fitting, and its variation is now associated with the anisotropic temperature.

<title>Investigating the Drivers of Electron Temperature Variations in H ii Regions with Keck-KCWI and VLT-MUSE</title>

<div> 关键词: H ii region, 电子温度, 金属丰度, PHANGS, 光谱测量<br />
总结: <br />
该研究使用光谱测量方法分析了七个邻近星系中H ii区的电子温度。研究发现不同离子测量的温度存在系统性差异，[O ii]和[S ii]的温度可能被电子密度不均匀性高估。同时，在一些具有高分子气体速度色散和低电离参数的区域中测得了较高的[O iii]温度，这可能是由低速冲击波导致的。与以往研究一致的是，[N ii]和[S iii]的温度具有最低的散布，并且与光电离模型预测相一致，这表明这些标量更好地反映了H ii区跨各种电离区的温度。 <br /> <div>
H ii region electron temperatures are a critical ingredient in metallicity determinations, and recent observations have revealed systematic variations in the temperatures measured using different ions. We present electron temperatures (Te) measured using the optical auroral lines ([N ii]λ5756, [O ii]λλ7320, 7330, [S ii]λλ4069, 4076, [O iii]λ4363, and [S iii]λ6312) for a sample of H ii regions in seven nearby galaxies. We use observations from the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby Galaxies survey (PHANGS) obtained with integral field spectrographs on Keck (Keck Cosmic Web Imager) and the Very Large Telescope (Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer). We compare the different Te measurements with H ii region and ISM environmental properties such as electron density, ionization parameter, molecular gas velocity dispersion, and stellar association/cluster mass and age obtained from PHANGS. We find that the temperatures from [O ii] and [S ii] are likely overestimated due to the presence of electron density inhomogeneities in H ii regions. We measure high [O iii] temperatures in a subset of regions with high molecular gas velocity dispersion and low ionization parameter, which may be explained by the presence of low-velocity shocks. In agreement with previous studies, the Te–Te between [N ii] and [S iii] temperatures have the lowest observed scatter and follow predictions from photoionization modeling, which suggests that these tracers reflect H ii region temperatures across the various ionization zones better than [O ii], [S ii], and [O iii].

<br /><br />在这项工作中，研究人员利用高分辨率、极长基线干涉技术观测了高速吸积的狭线塞弗特I星系I Zw 1。他们成功地在1.5GHz和5GHz发现了大约45pc的小尺度射流，基于高射电亮度温度、射电形态和谱指数分布。此外，I Zw 1中观测到的秒差尺射流显示出与其他类似速率吸积的源相似的结构。总的来说，观测到的高吸积率和射流特性支持了这种极端状态下AGN/X射线双星的类比。 
<br /><br />总结: 这项工作通过射电观测揭示了高速吸积状态下的黑洞射流现象，为我们理解这种极端状态下黑洞生长提供了重要线索，也支持了AGN/X射线双星的类比。 <div>
Accretion of black holes at near-Eddington or super-Eddington rates represents the most powerful episode driving black hole growth, potentially occurring across various types of objects. However, the physics governing accretion and jet–disk coupling in such states remains unclear, primarily due to the difficulty in detecting associated jets, which may emit extremely weakly or exhibit episodic behavior. Only a few near/super-Eddington systems have demonstrated radio activity, and it remains uncertain whether jets exist and what their properties are in super-Eddington active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and ultraluminous X-ray sources. This uncertainty stems mainly from the complex radio emission mix, which includes contributions from jets, star formation activity, photoionized gas, accretion disk wind, and coronal activity. In this work, we conducted high-resolution, very long baseline interferometry observations to investigate jets in the highly accreting narrow-line Seyfert I system I Zw 1. Our observations successfully revealed small-scale jets (with a linear size of ∼45 pc) at both 1.5 and 5 GHz, based on the high radio brightness temperature, radio morphology, and spectral index distribution. Additionally, the parsec-scale jet observed in I Zw 1 displays a knotted morphology reminiscent of other sources accreting at similar rates. In summary, the high accretion rates and jet properties observed in the AGN I Zw 1 may support the AGN/X-ray binary analogy in this extreme state.

总结:<br /><br />这项研究间接测量了低质量星系中质量载荷因子（质量流出速率与恒星形成速率之比）。研究使用了SAGA背景星系的光谱数据构建了一个包含11,925个低质量星系的样本，并对其中的120个星系测量了天王线金属丰度。研究采用了差分方法建模星系的低红移演化，推断了质量载荷因子的数值，并与文献中的直接测量和宇宙学模拟结果进行了比较。研究结果表明，质量载荷因子与最近的星系模拟结果相符，但与许多当代宇宙学模拟产生的质量载荷因子相比小了一个数量级。<br /> <div>
Measuring the relation between star formation and galactic winds is observationally difficult. In this work we make an indirect measurement of the mass-loading factor (the ratio between the mass outflow rate and star formation rate) in low-mass galaxies using a differential approach to modeling the low-redshift evolution of the star-forming main sequence and mass–metallicity relation. We use Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) background galaxies, i.e., spectra observed by the SAGA Survey that are not associated with the main SAGA host galaxies, to construct a sample of 11,925 spectroscopically confirmed low-mass galaxies from 0.01 ≲ z ≤ 0.21 and measure auroral line metallicities for 120 galaxies. The crux of the method is to use the lowest-redshift galaxies as the boundary condition of our model, and to infer a mass-loading factor for the sample by comparing the expected evolution of the low-redshift reference sample in stellar mass, gas-phase metallicity, and star formation rate against the observed properties of the sample at higher redshift. We infer a mass-loading factor of , which is in line with direct measurements of the mass-loading factor from the literature despite the drastically different sets of assumptions needed for each approach. While our estimate of the mass-loading factor is in good agreement with recent galaxy simulations that focus on resolving the dynamics of the interstellar medium, it is smaller by over an order of magnitude than the mass-loading factor produced by many contemporary cosmological simulations.

这篇文章利用高分辨率的模拟数据探讨了银河系类星际云的扩展气体包裹特性。研究团队提取了两打星际云的数据，并通过多种示踪物质测量和拟合，包括CO、H2、H、nCO和气体温度，来探索气体的三维热化学结构。研究发现，虽然最近通过三维尘埃测绘发现太阳邻域的星际云具有辐射对称的低密度包裹，约延伸10至15光年，但模拟的星际云主要呈现辐射不对称的低密度包裹，仅约延伸2至3光年。模拟中缺乏磁场可能是解释模拟云未展开包裹的潜在原因之一，同时相较太阳邻域条件，更强烈的局部反馈可能驱使了辐射不对称的星际云形态。研究团队还公开了用于提取和表征星际云半径结构的流程，供后续研究和模拟使用，以进一步探讨银河系中形成和演化星际云的关键物理过程。

We leverage recent numerical simulations of highly resolved star-forming regions in a Milky Way–like galaxy to explore the nature of extended gaseous envelopes around molecular clouds. We extract a sample of two dozen star-forming clouds from the feedback-dominated suite of Cloud Factory simulations. With the goal of exploring the 3D thermal and chemical structure of the gas, we measure and fit the clouds’ radial profiles with multiple tracers, including , , , nCO, and gas temperature. We find that while solar neighborhood clouds recently detected via 3D dust mapping have radially symmetric, low-density envelopes that extend ∼10–15 pc, the simulated cloud envelopes are primarily radially asymmetric with low-density envelopes that extend only ∼2–3 pc. One potential explanation for the absence of extended envelopes in the simulated clouds may be the lack of magnetic fields, while a stronger local feedback prescription compared to solar neighborhood conditions may drive the radially asymmetric cloud morphologies. We make the pipeline used to extract and characterize the radial profiles of the clouds publicly available, which can be used in complementary and future simulations to shed additional light on the key physics shaping the formation and evolution of star-forming structures in the Milky Way.

We have searched for radio pulsations toward 49 Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) 1FGL Catalog γ-ray sources using the Green Bank Telescope at 350 MHz. We detected 18 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in blind searches of the data; 10 of these were discoveries unique to our survey. 16 are binaries, with eight having short orbital periods PB < 1 day. No radio pulsations from young pulsars were detected, although three targets are coincident with apparently radio-quiet γ-ray pulsars discovered in LAT data. Here, we give an overview of the survey and present radio and γ-ray timing results for the 10 MSPs discovered. These include the only isolated MSP discovered in our survey and six short-PB binary MSPs. Of these, three have very-low-mass companions (Mc ≪ 0.1 M⊙) and hence belong to the class of black widow pulsars. Two have more massive, nondegenerate companions with extensive radio eclipses and orbitally modulated X-ray emission consistent with the redback class. Significant γ-ray pulsations have been detected from nine of the discoveries. This survey and similar efforts suggest that the majority of Galactic γ-ray sources at high Galactic latitudes are either MSPs or relatively nearby nonrecycled pulsars, with the latter having on average a much smaller radio/γ-ray beaming ratio as compared to MSPs. It also confirms that past surveys suffered from an observational bias against finding short-PB MSP systems.

RR Lyrae stars are standard candles with characteristic photometric variability and serve as powerful tracers of Galactic structure, substructure, accretion history, and dark matter content. Here we report the discovery of distant RR Lyrae stars, including some of the most distant stars known in the Milky Way halo, with Galactocentric distances of ∼300 kpc. We use time-series Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope/MegaCam photometry from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS). We use a template light-curve fitting method based on empirical Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82 RR Lyrae data to identify RR Lyrae candidates in the NGVS data set. We eliminate several hundred suspected quasars and identify 180 RR Lyrae candidates with heliocentric distances of ∼20–300 kpc. The halo stellar density distribution is consistent with an r−4.09±0.10 power-law radial profile over most of this distance range with no signs of a break. The distribution of ab-type RR Lyrae in a period–amplitude plot (Bailey diagram) suggests that the mean metallicity of the halo decreases outward. Compared to other recent RR Lyrae surveys, like Pan-STARRS1, the High Cadence Transient Survey, and the Dark Energy Survey, our NGVS study has better single-epoch photometric precision and a comparable number of epochs but smaller sky coverage. At large distances, our RR Lyrae sample appears to be relatively pure and complete, with well-measured periods and amplitudes. These newly discovered distant RR Lyrae stars are important additions to the few secure stellar tracers beyond 150 kpc in the Milky Way halo.

<br /><br />总结:
本文通过对11个明亮的类星体进行研究，比较了六种不同的方法（回归、共轭基向量、像素级去相关、eleanor、quaver和简单的差分光度法）的性能，以确定哪些方法能正确修正TESS光变曲线。通过与ZTF和ATLAS观测数据进行比较，发现只有简单的差分光度法、eleanor和quaver这三种方法产生的TESS光变曲线与地面观测结果一致。研究还进行了功率谱密度斜率比较和对ZTF数据进行最小二乘拟合，以量化光变曲线的其他统计特性。研究结果对于理解类星体的光变行为和识别潜在的中微子源具有重要意义。 <div>
Blazars are characterized by largely aperiodic variability on timescales ranging from minutes to decades across the electromagnetic spectrum. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission provides continuous sampling of blazar variability on timescales ranging from tens of minutes to 27 days for a single sector observation. Proper removal of the background, thermal ramping, and onboard systematic effects are crucial to the extraction of a reliable blazar light curve. Multiple publicly available procedures have been created to correct for these effects. Using ground-based observations from the Zwicky Transit Facility (ZTF) and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) as “ground truth” observations, we compare six different methods (regression, cotrending basis vectors, pixel-level decorrelation, eleanor, quaver, and simple differential photometry) to each other, and to our “ground truth” observations, to identify which methods properly correct light curves of a sample of 11 bright blazars, including the suspected neutrino source TXS 0506+056. In addition to comparing the resulting light curves, we compare the slopes of the power spectral densities, perform least-square fitting to simultaneous ZTF data, and quantify other statistical qualities generated from the light curves of each method. We find that only three of the six methods compared (simple differential photometry, eleanor, and quaver) produce TESS light curves consistent with the ground-based ZTF and ATLAS observations.

<div> ACT, Planck, tomographic measurements, CMB lensing, structure growth
<br />总结:
本研究利用ACT和Planck宇宙微波背景(CMB)透镜图与unWISE蓝光和绿色星系样本的交叉相关分析，进行了结构生长的层析测量。通过包括额外的光谱数据进行红移校准，并采用更灵活的理论模型分析测量结果，改进了先前对unWISE交叉相关的研究。我们发现，利用ACT交叉相关单独测得在低红移(z ≃ 0.2–1.6)上的物质涨落幅度 S8 = 0.810 ± 0.015，结合Planck和ACT的交叉相关测得 S8 = 0.810 ± 0.015；这些测量结果与假设标准结构生长的原始CMB测量预测完全一致。加入声学波动数据去除了σ8和Ωm之间的退化，允许我们从unWISE与ACT的交叉相关中测得σ8 = 0.813 ± 0.020，从与ACT和Planck的联合交叉相关中测得σ8 = 0.813 ± 0.015。这些结果也与ΛCDM宇宙学模型的预期一致；从我们在z∼0.6和1.1的两个红移样本中得出的σ8的一致性进一步验证了我们的宇宙模型。我们的结果表明，甚至在低红移z ≲ 1处，线性尺度上的结构形成也很好地由ΛCDM描述。 <div>
We present tomographic measurements of structure growth using cross-correlations of Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 and Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing maps with the unWISE Blue and Green galaxy samples, which span the redshift ranges 0.2 ≲ z ≲ 1.1 and 0.3 ≲ z ≲ 1.8, respectively. We improve on prior unWISE cross-correlations not just by making use of the new, high-precision ACT DR6 lensing maps, but also by including additional spectroscopic data for redshift calibration and by analyzing our measurements with a more flexible theoretical model. We determine the amplitude of matter fluctuations at low redshifts (z ≃ 0.2–1.6), finding using the ACT cross-correlation alone and S8 = 0.810 ± 0.015 with a combination of Planck and ACT cross-correlations; these measurements are fully consistent with the predictions from primary CMB measurements assuming standard structure growth. The addition of baryon acoustic oscillation data breaks the degeneracy between σ8 and Ωm, allowing us to measure σ8 = 0.813 ± 0.020 from the cross-correlation of unWISE with ACT and σ8 = 0.813 ± 0.015 from the combination of cross-correlations with ACT and Planck. These results also agree with the expectations from primary CMB extrapolations in ΛCDM cosmology; the consistency of σ8 derived from our two redshift samples at z ∼ 0.6 and 1.1 provides a further check of our cosmological model. Our results suggest that structure formation on linear scales is well described by ΛCDM even down to low redshifts z ≲ 1.

<div> 驱动演化的关键词: cataclysmic variables (CVs), period changes, magnetic braking model (MBM), angular momentum loss (AML), evolutionary track
总结:
cataclysmic variables (CVs)的演化受到周期改变的驱动。传统观点认为磁制动模型（MBM）对此起着关键作用，假设AML遵循幂律“配方”。作者收集了52个CVs的测量数据。首先发现44%的CVs具有正值的AML，而这在MBM中是不可能的。其次，即使是负值的AML，其测量值也总是比MBM要求的更负，平均偏差为110×。第三，三个CVs表现出大的混沌波动，这在MBM中也是不可能的，证明存在某种未知机制。第四，MBM未能解释许多新星事件中出现的大幅度周期减小对演化的长期影响，这一影响在大多数新星系统中占主导地位，并改变整体演化的AML的符号。第五，三颗复发新星在新星事件中突然发生一个数量级的变化，这在MBM中也是不可能的。因此，MBM的AML-配方存在数量级上的错误。 <br /><br /> <div>
The evolution of cataclysmic variables (CVs) is driven by period changes ( ), for which the long-venerable consensus is the magnetic braking model (MBM). The MBM has its only distinctive assumption being a power-law “recipe” describing the angular momentum loss (AML) in the binary, producing a single unique evolutionary track with as a function of the orbital period. This required prediction can be used to test the most-fundamental assumption of MBM, but it has never been tested previously. In this paper, I collect measures for 52 CVs of all types. First, 44% of the CVs have positive , with such being impossible in MBM. Second, even among the CVs with negative , their measures are always more negative than required by MBM, with an average deviation of 110×. Third, three CVs have large chaotic variations in that are impossible for MBM, proving that some unknown mechanism exists and is operating that dominates for these systems. Fourth, the MBM does not account for the long-term effects on evolution arising from the large sudden period decreases seen across many nova events, with this unaccounted effect dominating for the majority of nova systems and changing the sign of the overall evolutionary . Fifth, three recurrent novae are observed to suddenly change by an order of magnitude across a nova event, with this being impossible in the MBM. In all, the required MBM predictions all fail for my 52 CVs, usually by orders of magnitude, so the MBM AML-recipe is wrong by orders of magnitude.

星系演化受宇宙网环境影响，特别是对于质量小于10^10.8太阳质量的星系，环境越稀疏，恒星形成率和尘埃含量越高。半解析模型表明，稀疏环境的星系通常具有年轻的恒星群，恒星质量演化缓慢以及滞后的恒星形成过程。而对于质量大于10^10.8太阳质量的星系，环境差异较小，因为模型中的盘不稳定驱动的超大质量黑洞增长使得超大质量黑洞增长和星系扼制与环境无关。观测数据验证了这一结果，特别是在比较低的质量范围内，特定恒星形成率和尘埃质量似乎与环境无关。这一结果证实了超大质量黑洞在星系内部的生长渠道的重要性。 <br /><br />总结: 星系的年轻恒星群、恒星质量演化和恒星形成过程受宇宙网环境的影响，而大质量黑洞增长和星系扼制对环境的影响较小。观测数据验证了这一结果，表明超大质量黑洞在星系内部的生长渠道至关重要。 <div>
The large-scale environment of the cosmic web is believed to impact galaxy evolution, but there is still no consensus regarding the mechanisms. We use a semi-analytic model (SAM) galaxy catalog to study the star formation and dust content of local galaxies in different cosmic environments of the cosmic web—namely voids, filaments, walls, and nodes. We find a strong impact of the environment only for galaxies with Mstars ≲ 1010.8M⊙: the less dense the environment, the larger the star formation rate and dust content at fixed stellar mass. This is attributed to the fact that galaxies in less dense environments typically feature younger stellar populations, a slower evolution of their stellar mass, and delayed star formation compared to galaxies in denser environments. As for galaxies with Mstars ≳ 1010.8M⊙, the differences among environments are milder, due to the disk-instability-driven supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth implemented in the SAM, which makes SMBH growth, and thus galaxy quenching, environment-insensitive. We qualitatively test our predictions against observations by identifying environments in Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 16 using dust masses derived from the GAMA survey. The agreement is encouraging, particularly at , where the specific star formation rates and dust masses appear quite environment-insensitive. This result confirms the importance of in situ growth channels of SMBHs.

太阳风中的质子温度涨落表现出高度的间歇性，尤其是在惯性范围内的小尺度上。这种现象可能包含关于太阳风间歇性加热的信息，然而温度涨落的物理性质尚不清楚。通过2020年9月至2022年9月的太阳轨道器测量数据，研究人员确定了24秒尺度下的185个具有明确定义的最小方差方向的快速太阳风中温度间歇结构，并研究了它们的性质及动力学效应。基于质子温度的变化，间歇结构被分类为温度颠簸、阶跃、低谷和链状四种类型。研究人员发现，在考虑磁场构型和其他等离子体性质时，温度颠簸中有46个主要与镜像波模不稳定性相关的线性磁孔(LMH)，43个与局部温度增强有关的电流片 (CS)。阶跃结构与13个类似激波的结构和8个切向不连续有关。对于低谷结构，其中21个可能与镜像波模不稳定性有关，其余16个可能更偏向孤立子情景。38个链状结构被确定为压缩性类涡旋状结构，其中包含LMH和CS。这些结果有助于进一步理解太阳风湍流中的间歇性耗散过程。 <br /><br /> <div>
In the solar wind turbulence, proton temperature fluctuations are highly intermittent, especially at small scales in the inertial range. This phenomenon may contain information about solar wind intermittent heating. However, the physical nature of the temperature intermittency is not yet clear. Based on the measurements from Solar Orbiter between 2020 September and 2022 September, we identify 185 temperature intermittent structures at the scale of 24 s with well-defined minimum variance direction in the fast solar wind and study the nature and kinetic effects of them. According to the variations of proton temperature, the intermittent structures are classified into four types, including temperature bump, step, dip, and chain. When considering the magnetic field configuration together with other plasma properties, we find that, among the bump cases, 46 of them are linear magnetic holes (LMHs) that are mainly related to mirror-mode (MM) instability, and 43 of them are current sheets (CSs) with local temperature enhancement. The step cases are found to be associated with shock-like structures (13 cases) and tangential discontinuities (eight cases) that separate two different parcels of plasma. For the dip cases, 21 of them could be associated with the MM instability, and the rest of the 16 ones may prefer soliton scenario. The 38 chain cases are identified as compressive vortex-like structures and a mixture of LMHs and CSs. These results will help to further understand the intermittent dissipation process in the solar wind turbulence.

Potentially habitable exoplanets are targets of great interest for the James Webb Space Telescope and upcoming mission concepts such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory. Clouds strongly affect climate and habitability, but predicting their properties is difficult. In Global Climate Models (GCMs), especially those aiming at simulating Earth, cloud microphysics is often crudely approximated by assuming that all cloud particles have a single, constant size or a prescribed size distribution and that all clouds in a grid cell are identical. For exoplanets that range over a large phase space of planetary properties, this method could result in large errors. In this work, our goal is to determine how cloud microphysics on terrestrial exoplanets, whose condensable is mainly water vapor, depend on aerosol properties and planetary parameters such as surface pressure, surface gravity, and incident stellar radiation. We use the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres as a 1D microphysical model to simulate the formation and evolution of clouds including the processes of nucleation, condensation, evaporation, coagulation, and vertical transfer. In these 1D idealized experiments, we find that the parameters that determine the macrophysical thermal structure of the atmospheres, including surface pressure and stellar flux, impact cloud radiative effect (CRE) most significantly. Parameters such as gravity and number density of aerosols working as cloud condensation nuclei affect the microphysical processes of cloud formation, including activation and vertical transfer. They also have a significant, though weaker effect on CRE. This work motivates the development of more accurate GCM cloud schemes and should aid in the interpretation of future observations.

We study the coupling of hydrodynamics and reactions in simulations of the double-detonation model for Type Ia supernovae. When assessing the convergence of simulations, the focus is usually on spatial resolution; however, the method of coupling the physics together as well as the tolerances used in integrating a reaction network also play an important role. In this paper, we explore how the choices made in both coupling and integrating the reaction portion of a simulation (operator/Strang splitting versus the simplified spectral deferred corrections method we introduced previously) influences the accuracy, efficiency, and nucleosynthesis of simulations of double detonations. We find no need to limit reaction rates or reduce the simulation time step to the reaction timescale. The entire simulation methodology used here is GPU-accelerated and made freely available as part of the Castro simulation code.

<br /><br />总结:
该研究的主要目标是通过高光谱分析测量外行星大气特性，以连接我们对大气物理和行星形成的理解。研究比较了三种集成方法来处理模型不确定性，通过结合多个分析的后验分布：贝叶斯模型平均，一种使用留一预测密度的贝叶斯模型平均的变体，以及堆叠预测分布。他们通过拟合不同云和雾处理方式的模型，对热木星HD 209458b的哈勃空间望远镜（HST）+斯皮策先进望远镜的透射光谱进行了演示。所有的集成方法都导致检索参数的不确定性变大，但更真实并与物理化学的期望一致。建议采用堆叠作为最稳健的模型组合方法。这些方法可以用于结合独立检索代码和同一代码内不同模型的结果，并可广泛应用于其他外行星分析过程，如结合不同数据处理的结果。 <div>
A key goal of exoplanet spectroscopy is to measure atmospheric properties, such as abundances of chemical species, in order to connect them to our understanding of atmospheric physics and planet formation. In this new era of high-quality JWST data, it is paramount that these measurement methods are robust. When comparing atmospheric models to observations, multiple candidate models may produce reasonable fits to the data. Typically, conclusions are reached by selecting the best-performing model according to some metric. This ignores model uncertainty in favor of specific model assumptions, potentially leading to measured atmospheric properties that are overconfident and/or incorrect. In this paper, we compare three ensemble methods for addressing model uncertainty by combining posterior distributions from multiple analyses: Bayesian model averaging, a variant of Bayesian model averaging using leave-one-out predictive densities, and stacking of predictive distributions. We demonstrate these methods by fitting the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) + Spitzer transmission spectrum of the hot Jupiter HD 209458b using models with different cloud and haze prescriptions. All of our ensemble methods lead to uncertainties on retrieved parameters that are larger but more realistic and consistent with physical and chemical expectations. Since they have not typically accounted for model uncertainty, uncertainties of retrieved parameters from HST spectra have likely been underreported. We recommend stacking as the most robust model combination method. Our methods can be used to combine results from independent retrieval codes and from different models within one code. They are also widely applicable to other exoplanet analysis processes, such as combining results from different data reductions.

<title>Evidence for an Outer Component in the Continuum Reverberation Mapping of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Continuum reverberation mapping is widely used in studying the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Some indirect evidence and simulations have indicated that the diffuse continuum, especially the strong Balmer continuum from the broad-line region, may contribute to the continuum in the u/U band. Here, we present direct evidence for this contribution. In this work, we apply the ICCF-Cut method to continuum reverberation mapping to extract the possible diffuse continuum light curves of six AGNs, using high-cadence, high-quality, and multiband observations. We find the existence of an outer component out of the accretion disk for each of the six AGNs in the Swift U band. Meanwhile, similar results can be derived with the JAVELIN Photometric Reverberation Mapping Model for four of them. The lags of the outer components are consistent with the predicted Balmer continuum lags, which are about half of the Hβ lag values. Our result directly reinforces the understanding that an outer component, especially the Balmer continuum in the rest-frame u/U band, can contribute significantly to the continuum reverberation lags of AGNs.

On 2022 September 5, Parker Solar Probe (Parker) observed a large solar energetic particle (SEP) event at the unprecedented distance of only 15 RS from the Sun. The observations from the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (IS⊙IS) obtained over the course of this event are remarkably rich, and an overview is presented here. IS⊙IS is capable of measuring ions from 20 keV to over 100 MeV nuc−1 and electrons from 30 keV to 6 MeV; here, we primarily focus on the proton and helium measurements above 80 keV. Among the surprising results are evidence of inverse velocity dispersion at energies above 1 MeV during the onset of the event, a sharp decrease in the energetic particle intensities at all energies at the interplanetary shock crossing, and repeated short durations of highly anisotropic sunward flow. Many changes in the SEP intensities, anisotropy, and spectral steepness are coincident with solar wind structure boundaries identified using the Parker solar wind magnetic field and plasma data. However, there are significant changes that are not correlated with any clearly visible solar wind variation. The observations presented here serve as an introduction to a complex event with numerous opportunities for future, more in-depth studies.

<title>Latest Evolution of the X-Ray Remnant of SN 1987A: Beyond the Inner Ring</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3800</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Based on our Chandra imaging-spectroscopic observations, we present the latest evolution of the X-ray remnant of SN 1987A. Recent changes in the electron temperatures and volume emission measures suggest that the blast wave in SN 1987A is moving out of the dense inner ring structure, also called the equatorial ring (ER). The 0.5–2.0 keV X-ray light curve shows a linearly declining trend (by ∼4.5% yr−1) between 2016 and 2020 as the blast wave heats the hitherto unknown circumstellar medium (CSM) outside the ER. While the peak X-ray emission in the latest 0.3–8.0 keV image is still within the ER, the radial expansion rate in the 3.0–8.0 keV images suggests an increasing contribution of the X-ray emission from less dense CSM since 2012, at least partly from beyond the ER. It is remarkable that, since 2020, the declining soft X-ray flux has stabilized around ∼7 × 10−12 erg s−1 cm−2, which may signal a contribution from the reverse-shocked outer layers of ejecta as predicted by the three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic models. In the latest ACIS spectrum of supernova remnant 1987A in 2022 we report a significant detection of the Fe K line at ∼6.7 keV, which may be due to changing thermal conditions of the X-ray emitting CSM and/or the onset of reverse shock interactions with the Fe ejecta.

<title>Stability of C59 Knockout Fragments from Femtoseconds to Infinity</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have studied the stability of C59 anions as a function of time, from their formation on femtosecond timescales to their stabilization on second timescales and beyond, using a combination of theory and experiments. The fragments were produced in collisions between C60 fullerene anions and neutral helium gas at a velocity of 90 km s−1 (corresponding to a collision energy of 166 eV in the center-of-mass frame). The fragments were then stored in a cryogenic ion beam storage ring at the DESIREE facility, where they were followed for up to 1 minute. Classical molecular dynamics simulations were used to determine the reaction cross section and the excitation energy distributions of the products formed in these collisions. We find that about 15% of the ions initially stored in the ring are intact after about 100 ms and that this population then remains intact indefinitely. This means that C60 fullerenes exposed to energetic atoms and ions, such as stellar winds and shock waves, will produce stable, highly reactive products, like C59, that are fed into interstellar chemical reaction networks.

<title>ASASSN-18ap: A Dusty Tidal Disruption Event Candidate with an Early Bump in the Light Curve</title>

ASASSN-18ap最初被识别为超新星，但随后的现象表明它更可能是发生在尘埃环境中的潮汐撕裂事件。红外暴增的总能量远高于光至紫外范围的能量，暗示存在大量尘埃遮蔽、额外的极紫外成分或非均向的连续辐射。在明亮的起始阶段光变曲线出现了不规则的特征，这可能会提供关于光学发射的起源的见解。这些新发现有助于重新评估ASASSN-18ap的分类。
<br /><br />总结: ASASSN-18ap最可能是潮汐撕裂事件而非超新星，观测到了红外暴增和冕发射线，光变曲线的不规则特征为我们提供了新的见解。 <div>
We reexamined the classification of the optical transient ASASSN-18ap, which was initially identified as a supernova (SN) upon its discovery. Based on newly emerged phenomena, such as a delayed luminous infrared outburst and the emergence of luminous coronal emission lines, we suggest that ASASSN-18ap is more likely a tidal disruption event (TDE) in a dusty environment, rather than an SN. The total energy in the infrared outburst is 3.1 × 1051 erg, which is an order of magnitude higher than the total energy in the optical-to-UV range, indicating a large dust extinction, an extra-extreme ultraviolet component, or anisotropic continuum emission. A bumpy feature appeared in the optical light curve at the start of brightening, which was reported in a couple of TDEs very recently. This early bump may have been overlooked in the past, due to the lack of sufficient sampling of the light curves of most TDEs during their ascending phase, and it could provide insight into the origin of optical emission.

<br />总结:
本文研究了ACT天文望远镜数据释放6版（DR6）数据的宇宙微波背景（CMB）透镜功率谱分析中外星系前景的影响和缓解方法。通过两个独立的微波天空模拟来测试一系列缓解策略。研究表明，找到并减去点源、找到并减去团簇模型，以及使用最大限度减小剖面偏差的透镜估计器，可以将偏差降低到远远低于统计误差，透镜幅度Alens的推断偏差小于0.2σ。另外，我们还展示了另一种方法，即反投影宇宙红外背景（CIB）贡献模型并包含来自Planck的高频数据，其表现类似。其他清理频率的选项效果不佳，要么造成较大的噪声成本，要么导致透镜光谱的偏差恢复。除了这些基于模拟的测试外，我们还对ACT DR6数据进行了零测试，以检验我们的透镜谱估计对两个ACT使用的频率之间的前景水平差异的敏感性，同时取消CMB透镜信号。这些测试无论是在地图级别还是在波段功率级别进行了空化，均通过了测试。在DR6数据上执行的CIB反投影测量与我们的基线测量一致，表明CIB的污染不太可能显著偏离DR6透镜谱。这些测试的集合确保ACT DR6透镜测量和伴随论文中提出的宇宙学约束对外星系前景是健壮的。 <div>
We investigate the impact and mitigation of extragalactic foregrounds for the cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing power spectrum analysis of Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data release 6 (DR6) data. Two independent microwave sky simulations are used to test a range of mitigation strategies. We demonstrate that finding and then subtracting point sources, finding and then subtracting models of clusters, and using a profile bias-hardened lensing estimator together reduce the fractional biases to well below statistical uncertainties, with the inferred lensing amplitude, Alens, biased by less than 0.2σ. We also show that another method where a model for the cosmic infrared background (CIB) contribution is deprojected and high-frequency data from Planck is included has similar performance. Other frequency-cleaned options do not perform as well, either incurring a large noise cost or resulting in biased recovery of the lensing spectrum. In addition to these simulation-based tests, we also present null tests on the ACT DR6 data for sensitivity of our lensing spectrum estimation to differences in foreground levels between the two ACT frequencies used, while nulling the CMB lensing signal. These tests pass whether the nulling is performed at the map or bandpower level. The CIB-deprojected measurement performed on the DR6 data is consistent with our baseline measurement, implying that contamination from the CIB is unlikely to significantly bias the DR6 lensing spectrum. This collection of tests gives confidence that the ACT DR6 lensing measurements and cosmological constraints presented in companion papers to this work are robust to extragalactic foregrounds.

这篇文章报告了关于磁体星短暂爆发的引力波探测结果。研究通过对13次磁体星爆发事件的Advanced LIGO、Advanced Virgo和KAGRA第三次观测运行期间进行搜索，未发现任何与这些爆发事件相关的引力波。得到的上限值为短时搜索时在100Hz时达到3.6 × 10−23，长时搜索时在450Hz时达到1.1 × 10−22。根据磁体星的估计距离，推导出短时和长时搜索时引力波能量的上限。假设电磁辐射能量的各向同性发射，推断出来自SGR 1935+2154的引力波能量与电磁能量之比的最低值为4.5 × 103。 <div>
Gravitational waves are expected to be produced from neutron star oscillations associated with magnetar giant flares and short bursts. We present the results of a search for short-duration (milliseconds to seconds) and long-duration (∼100 s) transient gravitational waves from 13 magnetar short bursts observed during Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo, and KAGRA’s third observation run. These 13 bursts come from two magnetars, SGR 1935+2154 and Swift J1818.0−1607. We also include three other electromagnetic burst events detected by Fermi-GBM which were identified as likely coming from one or more magnetars, but they have no association with a known magnetar. No magnetar giant flares were detected during the analysis period. We find no evidence of gravitational waves associated with any of these 16 bursts. We place upper limits on the rms of the integrated incident gravitational-wave strain that reach 3.6 × 10−23 at 100 Hz for the short-duration search and 1.1 × 10−22 at 450 Hz for the long-duration search. For a ringdown signal at 1590 Hz targeted by the short-duration search the limit is set to 2.3 × 10−22 . Using the estimated distance to each magnetar, we derive upper limits on the emitted gravitational-wave energy of 1.5 × 1044 erg (1.0 × 1044 erg) for SGR 1935+2154 and 9.4 × 1043 erg (1.3 × 1044 erg) for Swift J1818.0−1607, for the short-duration (long-duration) search. Assuming isotropic emission of electromagnetic radiation of the burst fluences, we constrain the ratio of gravitational-wave energy to electromagnetic energy for bursts from SGR 1935+2154 with the available fluence information. The lowest of these ratios is 4.5 × 103.

We present an analysis of ground-based and JWST observations of SN 2022pul, a peculiar “03fg-like” (or “super-Chandrasekhar”) Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), in the nebular phase at 338 days postexplosion. Our combined spectrum continuously covers 0.4–14 μm and includes the first mid-infrared spectrum of a 03fg-like SN Ia. Compared to normal SN Ia 2021aefx, SN 2022pul exhibits a lower mean ionization state, asymmetric emission-line profiles, stronger emission from the intermediate-mass elements (IMEs) argon and calcium, weaker emission from iron-group elements (IGEs), and the first unambiguous detection of neon in a SN Ia. A strong, broad, centrally peaked [Ne ii] line at 12.81 μm was previously predicted as a hallmark of “violent merger” SN Ia models, where dynamical interaction between two sub-MCh white dwarfs (WDs) causes disruption of the lower-mass WD and detonation of the other. The violent merger scenario was already a leading hypothesis for 03fg-like SNe Ia; in SN 2022pul it can explain the large-scale ejecta asymmetries seen between the IMEs and IGEs and the central location of narrow oxygen and broad neon. We modify extant models to add clumping of the ejecta to reproduce the optical iron emission better, and add mass in the innermost region (<2000 km s−1) to account for the observed narrow [O i] λλ6300, 6364 emission. A violent WD–WD merger explains many of the observations of SN 2022pul, and our results favor this model interpretation for the subclass of 03fg-like SNe Ia.

总结: 
本文介绍了一种新技术，用于识别麦哲伦星流(MS)中的H i发射与附近92个QSO视线处的紫外线吸收体之间的关联。他们使用Wasserstein距离模型量化了H i元素与星流主体之间的关联程度，推导了MS中H i发射的特征空间和动力学距离。通过应用基于发射的模型，他们进一步开发了一个比较指标，用于确定UV吸收体与MS及附近星系的主要关联。研究发现，对于由C ii, C iv, Si ii, Si iii, Si iv探测的与MS相关的电离气体，其离子柱密度一般比不相关的高约0.5 dex，并且在MS尾部，气体更加电离，这体现在C ii/C iv比率的空间趋势上。他们还发现了与M33和NGC 300星系周星际介质相关的潜在新吸收体，并确认了与IC 1613和Wolf–Lundmark–Mellote星系的关联。对于M31，他们发现了与冲击参数的柱密度梯度，并且M31的银河半径外具有更高柱密度的吸收体更有可能与MS相关。他们的分析还揭示了MS和云之间连续且混合的弥散电离气体。这项技术可以应用于未来对复杂气态结构内部的关联的研究。 <br /><br /> <div>
We present a new technique to identify associations of H i emission in the Magellanic Stream (MS) and ultraviolet (UV) absorbers from 92 QSO sight lines near the MS. We quantify the level of associations of individual H i elements to the main H i body of the Stream using Wasserstein distance-based models, and derive characteristic spatial and kinematic distances of the H i emission in the MS. With the emission-based model, we further develop a comparison metric, which identifies the dominant associations of individual UV absorbers with respect to the MS and nearby galaxies. For ionized gas associated with the MS probed by C ii, C iv, Si ii, Si iii, Si iv, we find that the ion column densities are generally ∼0.5 dex higher than those that are not associated, and that the gas is more ionized toward the tail of the MS as indicated by the spatial trend of the C ii/C iv ratios. For nearby galaxies, we identify potential new absorbers associated with the circumgalactic medium of M33 and NGC 300, and affirm the associations of absorbers with IC 1613 and the Wolf–Lundmark–Mellote galaxy. For M31, we find the previously identified gradient in column densities as a function of the impact parameter, and that absorbers with higher column densities beyond M31's virial radius are more likely to be associated with the MS. Our analysis of absorbers associated with the Magellanic Clouds reveals the presence of continuous and blended diffuse ionized gas between the Stream and the Clouds. Our technique can be applied to future applications of identifying associations within physically complex gaseous structures.

<div> 关键词: 长时域伽马射线暴，宇宙红移，紫外光度函数，大小-光度关系，恒星形成。  
总结:  
本研究利用哈勃太空望远镜对23个红移在4至6之间的长时域伽马射线暴宿主星系进行了紫外光度和大小-光度关系的研究。研究发现，这些伽马射线暴宿主星系在红移z∼5时的性质与同一红移处的Lyman-break星系相似，证实了它们代表同一种类星系的预期。此外，本研究发现，有大约68%的大小-光度测量结果在或低于红移z∼4的Lyman-break星系的相同关系内。研究还表明，伽马射线暴能够作为探测高红移宇宙中隐藏星形成的有效方法。研究还发现，假设伽马射线暴能够无偏地追踪红移z∼5的星形成，那么我们的样本中未检测到的比例7/23与星系光度在我们检测限制M1600Å≈ −18.3 mag之下的一致性在95%的置信水平上是一致的，这表明了约13%–53%的红移z∼5的星形成发生在比我们的检测限制暗的星系中。 <div>
We present rest-frame UV Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the largest and most complete sample of 23 long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxies between redshifts 4 and 6. Of these 23, we present new WFC3/F110W imaging for 19 of the hosts, which we combine with archival WFC3/F110W and WFC3/F140W imaging for the remaining four. We use the photometry of the host galaxies from this sample to characterize both the rest-frame UV luminosity function (LF) and the size–luminosity relation of the sample. We find that when assuming the standard Schechter-function parameterization for the UV LF, the GRB host sample is best fit with and mag, which are consistent with results based on z ∼ 5 Lyman-break galaxies. We find that ∼68% of our size–luminosity measurements fall within or below the same relation for Lyman-break galaxies at z ∼ 4. This study observationally confirms expectations that at z ∼ 5 Lyman-break and GRB host galaxies should trace the same population and demonstrates the utility of GRBs as probes of hidden star formation in the high-redshift Universe. Under the assumption that GRBs unbiasedly trace star formation at this redshift, our nondetection fraction of 7/23 is consistent at the 95% confidence level with 13%–53% of star formation at redshift z ∼ 5 occurring in galaxies fainter than our detection limit of M1600Å ≈ −18.3 mag.

<div> 黑洞质量测量，椭圆星系，NGC 4786，NGC 5193，ALMA观测

ALMA观测和哈勃空间望远镜近红外成像显示，NGC 4786和NGC 5193的中心区域含有一个环状星盘，显示出约270 km/s的有序旋转速度。研究团队通过构建气体动力学模型并将其直接与ALMA数据立方体进行拟合，测量了这两个星系中心的黑洞质量，并分别为NGC 4786和NGC 5193。然而，ALMA观测并未完全解析出黑洞影响范围，也没有显示出中心旋转速度的上升，这表明未探测到SOI内部的发射。此外，测量中的最大误差来自宿主星系模型中与消光校正相关的系统性不确定性。这凸显了评估尘埃衰减对推断的黑洞质量的影响的重要性。<br /><br />总结: 本研究利用ALMA观测和气体动力学模型测量了NGC 4786和NGC 5193巨型椭圆星系中心的黑洞质量，结果显示两个星系中心可能存在大质量的黑洞。然而，由于ALMA观测未能完全解析出黑洞影响范围，并且消光校正的系统误差较大，黑洞质量的准确性尚待进一步确认。 <div>
We present molecular gas-dynamical mass measurements of the central black holes in the giant elliptical galaxies NGC 4786 and NGC 5193, based on CO (2−1) observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and Hubble Space Telescope near-infrared imaging. The central region in each galaxy contains a circumnuclear disk that exhibits orderly rotation with projected line-of-sight velocities of ∼270 km s−1. We build gas-dynamical models for the rotating disk in each galaxy and fit them directly to the ALMA data cubes. At 0.″31 resolution, the ALMA observations do not fully resolve the black hole sphere of influence (SOI), and neither galaxy exhibits a central rise in rotation speed, indicating that emission from deep within the SOI is not detected. As a result, our models do not tightly constrain the central black hole mass in either galaxy, but they prefer the presence of a central massive object in both galaxies. We measure the black hole mass to be in NGC 4786 and in NGC 5193. The largest component of each measurement’s error budget is from the systematic uncertainty associated with the extinction correction in the host galaxy models. This underscores the importance of assessing the impact of dust attenuation on the inferred MBH.

<div> dissipative self-interacting dark matter, baryonic zoom-in simulations, dwarf galaxies, Milky Way–mass hosts, circular velocity constraints
总结:<br /><br />本文使用了FIRE-2星系形成物理模型，将耗散暗物质自相互作用建模为常数分数能量耗散(fdiss = 0.75)，并通过宇宙学纯离子耗散耗散暗物质（dSIDM）的首个巴里昂缩放模拟来研究恒星等级为105-109M⊙的矮星系的性质。结果表明，在孤立的矮星系中，dSIDM模型能够产生更紧凑的星系尺寸并促进盘形成。然而，与观测的大小-质量关系相矛盾的是，当(σ/m) = 10 cm2 g−1时，星系的分布变得蓬松。另外，耗散暗物质会增强矮星系的亚千秒圆速度，这与局部星系群矮星系的运动测量一致，但与更大质量的场矮星系的H i旋转曲线存在矛盾。对于银河质量的卫星，dSIDM对中值圆速度轮廓的影响不大，但能够促进矮星卫星的结构多样性。总的来说，在质量较大的矮星系(Mhalo ∼ 1011M⊙)中，dSIDM模型存在圆速度约束的矛盾。然而，在更低有效截面的模型仍然是可行的，并且可以产生观测上的非平凡特征。 <div>
We analyze the first cosmological baryonic zoom-in simulations of galaxies in dissipative self-interacting dark matter (dSIDM). The simulations utilize the FIRE-2 galaxy formation physics with the inclusion of dissipative dark matter self-interactions modeled as a constant fractional energy dissipation (fdiss = 0.75). In this paper, we examine the properties of dwarf galaxies with M* ∼ 105–109M⊙ in both isolation and within Milky Way–mass hosts. For isolated dwarfs, we find more compact galaxy sizes and promotion of disk formation in dSIDM with (σ/m) ≤ 1 cm2 g−1. On the contrary, models with (σ/m) = 10 cm2 g−1 produce puffier stellar distributions that are in tension with the observed size–mass relation. In addition, owing to the steeper central density profiles, the subkiloparsec circular velocities of isolated dwarfs when (σ/m) ≥ 0.1 cm2 g−1 are enhanced by about a factor of 2, which are still consistent with the kinematic measurements of Local Group dwarfs but in tension with the H i rotation curves of more massive field dwarfs. Meanwhile, for satellites of Milky Way–mass hosts, the median circular velocity profiles are marginally affected by dSIDM physics, but dSIDM may help promote the structural diversity of dwarf satellites. The number of satellites is slightly enhanced in dSIDM, but the differences are small compared with the large host-to-host variations. In conclusion, the dSIDM models with (σ/m) ≳ 0.1 cm2 g−1, fdiss = 0.75 are in tension in massive dwarfs (Mhalo ∼ 1011M⊙) due to circular velocity constraints. However, models with lower effective cross sections (at this halo mass/velocity scale) are still viable and can produce nontrivial observable signatures.

<div> 关键词: Changing-look AGNs, Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), optical variability, Type 1 and Type 2 dichotomy, Eddington ratio<br />
总结: <br /><br />这篇文章研究了活动星系核（AGNs）的变化特征，发现了一种新的变化型AGNs，通过Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)光变数据和后续光谱数据，成功确定了Type 1和Type 2 AGNs，并确认了35个turn-on和12个turn-off的CL AGN候选者。CL AGNs的发生率约为0.3%，并且确认了CL转变通常发生在Eddington比率≲0.01。这项研究为我们对AGNs的理解和分类提供了新的线索。 <div>
Changing-look (CL) active galactic nuclei (AGNs), characterized by the appearance/disappearance of broad emission lines in the span of a few years, present a challenge for the AGN unified model, whereby the Type 1 versus Type 2 dichotomy results from orientation effects alone. We present a systematic study of a large sample of spectroscopically classified AGNs, using optical variability data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) as well as follow-up spectroscopy data. We demonstrate that Type 1 and Type 2 AGNs can be neatly separated on the basis of the variability metric σQSO, which quantifies the resemblance of a light curve to a damped random walk model. For a small subsample, however, the ZTF light curves are inconsistent with their previous classification, suggesting the occurrence of a CL event. Specifically, we identify 35 (12) turn-on (turn-off) CL AGN candidates at z < 0.35. Based on follow-up spectroscopy, we confirm 17 (4) turn-on (turn-off) CL AGNs out of 21 (5) candidates, representing a high success rate for our method. Our results suggest that the occurrence rate of CL AGNs is ∼0.3% over timescales of 5–20 yr, and confirm that the CL transition typically occurs at an Eddington ratio of ≲0.01.

总结:
太阳风驱动了离子从行星大气中流出的过程，地球和火星的离子流动方式有所不同。在2016年5月，当地球和火星几乎处于太阳的同一侧时，记录了太阳风相互作用区/高速流的通过事件。地球和火星都观测到了离子流增强的迹象，从而确定了离子流的主要驱动因素。总结: <br /><br /> <div>
One of the major processes that solar wind drives is the outflow and escape of ions from the planetary atmospheres. The major ion species in the upper ionospheres of both Earth and Mars is O+, and hence it is more likely to dominate the escape process. On Earth, due to a strong intrinsic magnetic field, the major ion outflow pathways are through the cusp, polar cap, and the auroral oval. In contrast, Mars has an induced magnetosphere, where the ionosphere is in direct contact with the shocked solar wind plasma. Therefore, physical processes underlying the ion energization and escape rates are expected to be different on Mars as compared to Earth. In the current work, we study the near-simultaneous ion outflow event from both Earth and Mars during the passage of a stream interaction region/high-speed stream (SIR/HSS) during 2016 May, when both the planets were approximately aligned on the same side of the Sun. The SIR/HSS propagation was recorded by spacecraft at the Sun–Earth L1 point and Mars Express at 1.5 au. During the passage of the SIR, the dayside and nightside ion outflows at Earth were observed by Van Allen Probes and Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission orbiters, respectively. At Mars, the ion energization at different altitudes was observed by the STATIC instrument on board the MAVEN orbiter. We observe evidence for the enhanced ion outflow from both Earth and Mars during the passage of the SIR, and identify the dominant drivers of the ion outflow.

The supernova remnant (SNR) 0540–69.3, twin of the Crab Nebula, offers an excellent opportunity to study the continuum emission from a young pulsar and pulsar wind nebula (PWN). We present observations taken with the Very Large Telescope instruments MUSE and X-shooter in the wavelength range 3000–25000 Å, which allow us to study spatial variations of the optical spectra, along with the first near-infrared (NIR) spectrum of the source. We model the optical spectra with a power law (PL) Fν ∝ ν−α and find clear spatial variations (including a torus–jet structure) in the spectral index across the PWN. Generally, we find spectral hardening toward the outer parts, from α ∼ 1.1 to ∼0.1, which may indicate particle reacceleration by the PWN shock at the inner edge of the ejecta or alternatively time variability of the pulsar wind. The optical–NIR spectrum of the PWN is best described by a broken PL, confirming that several breaks are needed to model the full spectral energy distribution of the PWN, and suggesting the presence of more than one particle population. Finally, subtracting the PWN contribution from the pulsar spectrum we find that the spectrum is best described with a broken-PL model with a flat and a positive spectral index, in contrast to the Crab pulsar that has a negative spectral index and no break in the optical. This might imply that pulsar differences propagate to the PWN spectra.

<title>Distribution of Merging and Post-merger Galaxies in Nearby Galaxy Clusters</title>

We study the incidence and spatial distribution of galaxies that are currently undergoing gravitational merging (M) or that have signs of being post-merger (PM) in six galaxy clusters (A754, A2399, A2670, A3558, A3562, and A3716) within the redshift range of 0.05 ≲ z ≲0.08. To this aim, we obtained Dark Energy Camera mosaics in the , , and bands covering up to 3 × R200 of the clusters, reaching 28 mag arcsec−2 surface brightness limits. We visually inspect color-composite images of volume-limited (Mr < −20) cluster member galaxies to identify whether galaxies are of M or PM type. We find 4% M-type and 7% PM-type galaxies in the galaxy clusters studied. By adding spectroscopic data and studying the projected phase-space diagram (PPSD) of the projected clustocentric radius and the line-of-sight velocity, we find that PM-type galaxies are more virialized than M-type galaxies, having a 1%–5% higher fraction within the escape-velocity region, while the fraction of M-type was ∼10% higher than the PM type in the intermediate environment. Similarly, on a substructure analysis, M types were found in groups in the outskirts, while PM-type populated groups were found in ubiquitous regions of the PPSD. Adopting literature-derived dynamical state indicator values, we observed a higher abundance of M types in dynamically relaxed clusters. This finding suggests that galaxies displaying post-merger features within clusters likely merged in low-velocity environments, including clusters outskirts and dynamically relaxed clusters.

<title>Massive Debris Disks May Hinder Secular Stirring by Planetary Companions: An Analytic Proof of Concept</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad32d1</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Debris disks or exo-Kuiper belts, detected through their thermal or scattered emission from their dusty components, are ubiquitous around main-sequence stars. Since dust grains are short-lived, their sustained presence is thought to require dynamical excitation, i.e., “stirring,” of a massive reservoir of large planetesimals, such that mutual collisions are violent enough to continually supply fresh dust. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain debris disk stirring, with the commonly accepted being long-term, secular planet–debris disk interactions. However, while effective, existing planet-stirring models are rudimentary; namely, they ignore the (self-)gravity of the disk, treating it as a massless reservoir of planetesimals. Here, using a simple analytical model, we investigate the secular interactions between eccentric planets and massive, external debris disks. We demonstrate that the disk gravity drives fast apsidal precession of both planetesimal and planetary orbits, which, depending on the system parameters, may well exceed the planet-induced precession rate of planetesimals. This results in strong suppression of planetesimal eccentricities and thus relative collisional velocities throughout the disk, often by more than an order of magnitude when compared to massless disk models. We thus show that massive debris disks may hinder secular stirring by eccentric planets orbiting near, e.g., the disk’s inner edge, provided the disk is more massive than the planet. We provide simple analytic formulae to describe these effects. Finally, we show that these findings have important implications for planet inferences in debris-bearing systems, as well as for constraining the total masses of debris disks (as done for β Pic).

The computational fluid dynamics on a sphere is relevant to global simulations of geophysical fluid dynamics. Using the conventional spherical–polar (or lat–lon) grid results in a singularity at the poles, with orders-of-magnitude-smaller cell sizes at the poles in comparison to the equator. To address this problem, we developed a general circulation model (dynamic core) with a gnomonic equiangular cubed-sphere configuration. This model is developed based on the Simulating Nonhydrostatic Atmospheres on Planets model, using a finite-volume numerical scheme with a Riemann-solver-based dynamic core and the vertical implicit correction scheme. This change of the horizontal configuration gives a 20-time acceleration of global simulations compared to the lat–lon grid with a similar number of cells at medium resolution. We presented standard tests ranging from 2D shallow-water models to 3D general circulation tests, including Earth-like planets and shallow hot Jupiters, to validate the accuracy of the model. The method described in this article is generic to transform any existing finite-volume hydrodynamic model in the Cartesian geometry to the spherical geometry.

<title>Spectroscopic Observations of the Solar Corona during the 2017 August 21 Total Solar Eclipse: Comparison of Spectral Line Widths and Doppler Shifts between Open and Closed Magnetic Structures</title>

The spectroscopic observations presented here were acquired during the 2017 August 21 total solar eclipse (TSE) with a three-channel partially multiplexed imaging spectrometer operating at extremely high orders (>50). The 4 R⊙ extent of the slit in the north–south direction scanned the corona starting from the central meridian out to approximately 1.0 R⊙ off the east limb throughout totality. The line widths and Doppler shifts of the Fe x (637.4 nm) and Fe xiv (530.3 nm) emission lines, characteristic of 1.1 × 106 K and 1.8 × 106 K electron temperatures, respectively, varied across the different coronal structures intercepted by the slit. Fe xiv was the dominant emission in the closed fields of an active region and the base of a streamer, with relatively constant 20–30 km s−1 line widths independent of the height. In contrast, Fe x emission exhibited broader (>40 km s−1) line widths in open fields, which increased with height, in particular in the polar coronal hole. Inferences of line widths and Doppler shifts were consistent with extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations from the Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrograph, as well as with the near-infrared Fe xiii 1074 nm line observed by Coronal Multichannel Polarimeter. The differences in the spectral line widths between distinct coronal structures are interpreted as an indication of the predominance of wave heating in open structures versus localized heating in closed structures. This study underscores the unparalleled advantages and the enormous potential of TSE spectroscopy in measuring line widths simultaneously in open and closed fields at high altitudes, with minimal exposure times, stray light levels, and instrumental widths.

<title>The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS). III. A Catalog of Surface Brightness Fluctuation Distances and the Three-dimensional Distribution of Galaxies in the Virgo Cluster</title>

The surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) method is a robust and efficient way of measuring distances to galaxies containing evolved stellar populations. Although many recent applications of the method have used space-based imaging, SBF remains a powerful technique for ground-based telescopes. Deep, wide-field imaging surveys with subarcsecond seeing enable SBF measurements for numerous nearby galaxies. Using a preliminary calibration, Cantiello et al. presented SBF distances for 89 bright, mainly early-type galaxies observed in the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey. Here we present a refined calibration and SBF distances for 278 galaxies extending several magnitudes fainter than in previous work. The derived distances have uncertainties of 5%–12% depending on the properties of the individual galaxies, and our sample is more than 3 times larger than any previous SBF study of this region. Virgo has a famously complex structure with numerous subclusters, clouds, and groups; we associate individual galaxies with the various substructures and map their three-dimensional spatial distribution. Curiously, subcluster A, centered around M87, appears to have two peaks in distance: the main peak at ∼16.5 Mpc, and a smaller one at ∼19.4 Mpc. Subclusters B and C have distances of ∼15.8 Mpc. The W and W groups form a filament-like structure, extending more than 15 Mpc behind the cluster with a commensurate velocity increase of ∼1000 km s−1 along its length. These measurements are a valuable resource for future studies of the relationship between galaxy properties and local environment within a dynamic and evolving region.

There are now multiple direct probes of the region near black hole horizons, including direct imaging with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). As a result, it is now of considerable interest to identify what aspects of the underlying spacetime are constrained by these observations. For this purpose, we present a new formulation of an existing broad class of integrable, axisymmetric, stationary spinning black hole spacetimes, specified by four free radial functions, that makes manifest which functions are responsible for setting the location and morphology of the event horizon and ergosphere. We explore the size of the black hole shadow and higher-order photon rings for polar observers, approximately appropriate for the EHT observations of M87*, finding analogous expressions to those for general spherical spacetimes. Of particular interest, we find that these are independent of the properties of the ergosphere, but do directly probe the free function that defines the event horizon. Based on those expressions, we extend the nonperturbative, nonparametric characterization of the gravitational implications of various near-horizon measurements to spinning spacetimes. Finally, we demonstrate this characterization for a handful of explicit alternative spacetimes.

The TeV afterglow of the BOAT GRB 221009A was interpreted as arising from a narrow jet, while the radio-to-X-ray afterglows were interpreted as arising from a wide structured jet. However, there is no model explaining the TeV and lower-energy multiwavelength afterglows simultaneously. We here investigate a two-component jet model, including a narrow uniform core with a wide structured wing, to explain both the multiwavelength afterglows that last up to 100 days. We find that to explain the early TeV afterglow with the inverse-Compton process, we need a circumburst density higher than ≳0.1 cm−3, while the radio afterglow and the H.E.S.S. upper limit combine to constrain the density to be lower at larger radii. Thus, a decreasing density profile with radius is favored. Considering that the rising TeV light curve during the afterglow onset favors a constant-density medium, we invoke a stratified density profile, including a constant-density profile at small radii and a wind density profile at large radii. We find that the two-component jet model with such a stratified density profile can explain the TeV, X-ray, and optical afterglows of GRB 221009A, although the radio fluxes exceed the observed ones by a factor of 2 at later epochs. The discrepancy in the radio afterglow could be resolved by invoking some nonstandard assumption about the microphysics of afterglow shocks. The total kinetic energy of the two components in our model is ≲1052 erg, significantly smaller than that in the single structured jet models.

The reappearance of supernova Refsdal with detailed modeling of the lens cluster allows us to measure the time-delay distance, which serves as a powerful tool to determine the Hubble constant (H0). We give a cosmological-model-independent method to estimate H0 through Gaussian process regression, using time-delay measurements from this lensed supernova in combination with supernova data from the Pantheon+ sample. Using eight mass models for the lens cluster, we infer , and using two cluster models most consistent with the observations, we infer . Our estimates of the value of H0 are in 1σ agreement with the results assuming a flat ΛCDM model and the uncertainties are comparable. Our constraint results on H0 from the eight lens models and the two lens models indicate 2σ and 1.8σ tensions with that estimated by Supernova H0 for the Equation of State, respectively. However, our median values of H0 from the two sets of lens models show good consistency with H0 inferred from Planck cosmic microwave background observations assuming a ΛCDM model within 1σ. We also find that our results for H0 indicate 2σ deviations and 1.7σ deviations from the constraint results of H0 using six time-delay quasars by H0LiCOW with the same analysis method.

<title>Analysis of BMR Tilt from AutoTAB Catalog: Hinting toward the Thin Flux Tube Model?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
One of the intriguing mechanisms of the Sun is the formation of bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs) in the solar convection zone (CZ), which are observed as regions of concentrated magnetic fields of opposite polarity on the photosphere. These BMRs are tilted with respect to the equatorial line, which statistically increases with latitude. The thin flux tube model, employing the rise of magnetically buoyant flux loops and their twist by Coriolis force, is a popular paradigm for explaining the formation of tilted BMRs. In this study, we assess the validity of the thin flux tube model by analyzing the tracked BMR data obtained through the Automatic Tracking Algorithm for BMRs. Our observations reveal that the tracked BMRs exhibit the expected collective behaviors. We find that the polarity separation of BMRs increases over their normalized lifetime, supporting the assumption of a rising flux tube from the CZ. Moreover, we observe an increasing trend of the tilt with the flux of the BMR, suggesting that rising flux tubes associated with lower flux regions are primarily influenced by drag force and Coriolis force, while in higher flux regions, magnetic buoyancy dominates. Furthermore, we observe Joy’s law dependence for emerging BMRs from their first detection, indicating that at least a portion of the tilt observed in BMRs can be attributed to the Coriolis force. Notably, lower flux regions exhibit a higher amount of fluctuations associated with their tilt measurement compared to stronger flux regions, suggesting that lower flux regions are more susceptible to turbulent convection.

<div> 密度波，螺旋结构，剪切波，螺旋增强，银河系

总结:
本文将螺旋结构的两种类型整合为一个统一的描述，包括了密度波在紧密螺旋极限之外的剪切和非稳定开放螺旋的情况。这一剪切波场景新颖地捕捉到了螺旋增强，使得结构形成超过了传统的Q阈值。然而，它也突出了对螺旋作用在增幅过程中的基本作用，不论波是剪切的还是不剪切的。因此，它通过Lynden-Bell＆Kalnajs所描述的驴效应捕捉了共振和非共振模式的增长，关键是当驴行为不再被允许时增长的停止。我们的计算预测，仅在Jeans长度之上，后螺旋结构会增长，螺旋结构的突出特性是其跨越一系列取向，随着臂的重复次数的减少而增加，以及增长最快的临界方向对于两种模式和物质模式相同。预测的结构与高度规则，高重复次数的气体跨度特征和螺旋和条状体上间距接近Jeans尺度的长丝相一致。应用于恒星盘时，条件有利于低重复次数（m < 5）的开放后螺旋，其螺距角在观测范围10° < ip < 50°内。这项工作的结果作为描述螺旋的一个统一的瞬态波类的基础，丰富刺激，但根据当地条件进行增长的严格选择。 <div>
Theories of spiral structure traditionally separate into tight-winding Lin–Shu spiral density waves and the swing-amplified material patterns of Goldreich & Lynden-Bell and Julian & Toomre. In this paper we consolidate these two types of spirals into a unified description, treating density waves beyond the tight-winding limit, in the regime of shearing and nonsteady open spirals. This shearing wave scenario novelly captures swing amplification that enables structure formation above conventional Q thresholds. However, it also highlights the fundamental role of spiral forcing on the amplification process in general, whether the wave is shearing or not. Thus it captures resonant and nonresonant mode growth through the donkey effect described by Lynden-Bell & Kalnajs and, critically, the cessation of growth when donkey behavior is no longer permitted. Our calculations predict growth exclusive to trailing spirals above the Jeans length, the prominence of spirals across a range of orientations that increases with decreasing arm multiplicity, and a critical orientation where growth is fastest that is the same for both modes and material patterns. Predicted structures are consistent with highly regular, high-multiplicity gaseous spur features and long filaments spaced close to the Jeans scale in spirals and bars. Applied to stellar disks, conditions favor low multiplicity (m < 5) open trailing spirals with pitch angles in the observed range 10° < ip < 50°. The results of this work serve as a basis for describing spirals as a unified class of transient waves, abundantly stimulated but narrowly selected for growth depending on local conditions.

<div> 关键词: 红外暗云、磁场、星云、引力、湍流
总结: 
红外暗云G28.34的磁场与星云尺度的关系复杂，大尺度上磁场对引力有一定抵抗作用，但在小尺度上会被星云的引力扭曲，并受恒星形成活动的影响。通过多种分析方法，发现G28.34处于次阿尔文环境，磁场有效地阻止了大尺度弥散气体的引力坍缩，但在星云内部受引力影响，且受恒星形成活动的影响。考虑了热、磁、湍流支撑后发现，G28.34环境气体处于超维里状态，红外暗云可能处于接近平衡状态，而核心MM4-core4则处于次维里状态。综上所述，磁场在大尺度上主导了云的形成和演化过程，导致云的形成和演化过程相对缓慢。在云内部，引力可能克服了磁场和湍流的作用，促使局部动力学恒星形成的发生。 <div>
We have comprehensively studied the multiscale physical properties of the massive infrared dark cloud G28.34 (the Dragon cloud) with dust polarization and molecular line data from Planck, FCRAO-14 m, James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We find that the averaged magnetic fields of clumps tend to be either parallel with or perpendicular to the cloud-scale magnetic fields, while the cores in clump MM4 tend to have magnetic fields aligned with the clump fields. Implementing the relative orientation analysis (for magnetic fields, column density gradients, and local gravity), velocity gradient technique, and modified Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi analysis, we find that G28.34 is located in a trans-to-sub-Alfvénic environment; the magnetic field is effectively resisting gravitational collapse in large-scale diffuse gas, but is distorted by gravity within the cloud and affected by star formation activities in high-density regions, and the normalized mass-to-flux ratio tends to increase with increasing density and decreasing radius. Considering the thermal, magnetic, and turbulent supports, we find that the environmental gas of G28.34 is in a supervirial (supported) state, the infrared dark clumps may be in a near-equilibrium state, and core MM4-core4 is in a subvirial (gravity-dominant) state. In summary, we suggest that magnetic fields dominate gravity and turbulence in the cloud environment at large scales, resulting in relatively slow cloud formation and evolution processes. Within the cloud, gravity could overwhelm both magnetic fields and turbulence, allowing local dynamical star formation to happen.

研究使用Atacama大型毫米/亚毫米阵列对V883 Ori进行无偏光谱调查。检测到的分子发射线揭示了Keplerian盘和向内坠落包络的形态/运动学特征。在CO、HCO+、HCN、HNC和H2CO中检测到了直接向内坠落的特征，即红移吸收。HCO+和SO显示大型类似臂的结构，可能连接向内坠落的包络和盘。HCN和H2CO显示内外盘之间的明显边界和可能的螺旋结构，连接外盘和内盘。HNC显示一个由于高温下其化学转变为HCN而产生的大型中心发射空洞（r∼0.″3）。检测到了HDO发射，这是水升华区域的直接追踪者。复杂有机分子的分子发射受限于HDO发射边界，HCO+在其分布中有一个发射空洞，这是由于其被水分解造成的。所有这些特征表明V883 Ori当前的喷发可能是由从包络向外盘的向内坠落触发的，从而产生一股向内传播的螺旋波，极大地增强了对中心恒星的吸积。<br /><br />总结: 该研究使用阿塔卡马大型毫米/亚毫米阵列对V883 Ori进行了光谱调查。观测到了从分子中心向外向内坠落的特征，还发现了大量分子发射和向内坠落包络与盘的连接结构。研究结果揭示了星风活动、爆发事件的触发机制，并有助于了解这一年轻恒星的形成和发展过程。 <div>
An unbiased spectral survey of V883 Ori, an eruptive young star, was carried out with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Band 6. The detected line emission from various molecules reveals morphological/kinematical features in both the Keplerian disk and the infalling envelope. A direct infall signature, redshifted absorption against the continuum, has been detected in CO, HCO+, HCN, HNC, and H2CO. HCO+ and SO show large armlike structures that probably connect the infalling envelope to the disk. HCN and H2CO reveal a distinct boundary between the inner and outer disks and tentative spiral structures connecting the outer disk to the inner disk. HNC shows a large central emission hole (r ∼ 0.″3) due to its chemical conversion to HCN at high temperatures. HDO emission, a direct tracer of the water sublimation region, has been detected in the disk. Molecular emission from complex organic molecules is confined within the HDO emission boundary, and HCO+ has an emission hole in its distribution due to its destruction by water. Together, these features suggest that the current episode of eruption in V883 Ori may be triggered by the infall from the envelope to the outer disk, generating a spiral wave that propagates inward and greatly enhances the accretion onto the central star.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了对FU Orionis爆发系统的观测结果，使用了ALMA的12m、7m和全功率阵列观测数据，涵盖了160到25,000天文单位的空间尺度。高分辨率的干涉数据揭示了一个纵向的12CO(2–1)特征，这个特征被认为是一个进食串流，供给了双星系统。观测到的串流质量流速远低于典型的恒星吸积速率，提示这个串流本身不足以维持典型的爆发类型的增强吸积速率。此外，文章还观测到一个巨大的、缓慢移动的二氧化碳分子流，这个分子流被认为是不与当前的爆发有关的被扫描材料，类似于其他FUor和I类原恒星物体周围观测到的缓慢分子流。 <div>
We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array 12-m, 7-m, and Total Power Array observations of the FU Orionis outbursting system, covering spatial scales ranging from 160 to 25,000 au. The high-resolution interferometric data reveal an elongated 12CO(2–1) feature previously observed at lower resolution in 12CO(3–2). Kinematic modeling indicates that this feature can be interpreted as an accretion streamer feeding the binary system. The mass infall rate provided by the streamer is significantly lower than the typical stellar accretion rates (even in quiescent states), suggesting that this streamer alone is not massive enough to sustain the enhanced accretion rates characteristic of the outbursting class prototype. The observed streamer may not be directly linked to the current outburst, but rather a remnant of a previous, more massive streamer that may have contributed enough to the disk mass to render it unstable and trigger the FU Orionis outburst. The new data detect, for the first time, a vast, slow-moving carbon monoxide molecular outflow emerging from this object. To accurately assess the outflow properties (mass, momentum, and kinetic energy), we employ 13CO(2–1) data to correct for optical depth effects. The analysis indicates that the outflow corresponds to swept-up material not associated with the current outburst, similar to the slow molecular outflows observed around other FUor and Class I protostellar objects.

<div> 关键词: ICMEs, 磁场, 太阳风, ME, 太阳探测器<br />
<br />总结: 通过对ICMEs的统计调查，研究者们发现了一些有趣的结果。首先，他们发现靠近太阳处更容易观测到相干的ICME配置，而在较远处更容易观测到更复杂的配置。其次，他们通过多元鲁棒回归推导出了1 au内磁性喷射物（ME）的扩展速率比先前的统计估计要慢。此外，他们还发现ICME鞘内的磁场波动与日风到ME的相对磁场强度梯度强烈耦合。第三，他们认为ME的扩展是鞘形成中的一个重要因素。最后，他们确定了畸变参数（DiP），发现ME的整体不对称性较低，而且即使对于扩展的ME，样本ME的持续时间与DiP值没有相关性，表明老化效应不是观察到的ME不对称性的唯一贡献因素。 <div>
We present a statistical investigation of the radial evolution of 28 interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs), measured in situ by the Parker Solar Probe spacecraft from 2018 October to 2022 August. First, by analyzing the radial distribution of ICME classification based on magnetic hodograms, we find that coherent configurations are more likely to be observed close to the Sun. By contrast, more complex configurations are observed farther out. We also notice that the post-ICME magnetic field is more impacted following an ICME passage at larger heliocentric distances. Second, with a multilinear robust regression, we derive a slower magnetic ejecta (ME) expansion rate within 1 au compared to previous statistical estimates. Then, investigating the magnetic field fluctuations within ICME sheaths, we see that these fluctuations are strongly coupled to the relative magnetic field strength gradient from the upstream solar wind to the ME. Third, we identify ME expansion as an important factor in the formation of sheaths. Finally, we determine the distortion parameter (DiP), which is a measure of magnetic field asymmetry in an ME. We discover lower overall asymmetries within MEs. We reveal that even for expanding MEs, the time duration over which an ME is sampled does not correlate with DiP values, indicating that the aging effect is not the sole contributor to the observed ME asymmetries.

总结: <br /><br />研究目的是通过比较观测系统和理论模型的预测结果来测试大质量恒星形成的理论模型。通过进行CO分子线辐射传递后处理来生成不同转变的12CO、13CO和C18O发射的合成位置-位置-速度立方体。对这些辐射进行模拟ALMA观测，并对从分子线中得到的质量、动量和动能估计与真实值进行比较。结果发现质量和动量的估计可能有高达4倍的不确定性，而动能估计更为低估。此外，还对合成光谱中得到的质量和动量流出速率与真实值进行比较。最后，将合成光谱与ALMA观测到的原恒星进行比较，并计算质量和动量流出速率，发现两者与理论恒星演化轨迹相吻合。 <div>
To test theoretical models of massive star formation it is important to compare their predictions with observed systems. To this end, we conduct CO molecular line radiative transfer post-processing of 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of various stages in the evolutionary sequence of a massive protostellar core, including its infall envelope and disk wind outflow. Synthetic position–position–velocity cubes of various transitions of 12CO, 13CO, and C18O emission are generated. We also carry out simulated Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of this emission. We compare the mass, momentum, and kinetic energy estimates obtained from molecular lines to the true values, finding that the mass and momentum estimates can have uncertainties of up to a factor of 4. However, the kinetic energy estimated from molecular lines is more significantly underestimated. Additionally, we compare the mass outflow rate and momentum outflow rate obtained from the synthetic spectra with the true values. Finally, we compare the synthetic spectra with real examples of ALMA-observed protostars and determine the best-fitting protostellar masses and outflow inclination angles. We then calculate the mass outflow rate and momentum outflow rate for these sources, finding that both rates agree with theoretical protostellar evolutionary tracks.

X-ray spectroscopy of heavily obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) offers a unique opportunity to study the circumnuclear environment of accreting supermassive black holes. However, individual models describing the obscurer have unique parameter spaces that give distinct parameter posterior distributions when fit to the same data. To assess the impact of model-specific parameter dependencies, we present a case study of the nearby heavily obscured low-luminosity AGN NGC 3982, which has a variety of column density estimations reported in the literature. We fit the same broadband XMM-Newton+NuSTAR spectra of the source with five unique obscuration models and generate posterior parameter distributions for each. By using global parameter exploration, we traverse the full prior-defined parameter space to accurately reproduce complex posterior shapes and inter-parameter degeneracies. The unique model posteriors for the line-of-sight column density are broadly consistent, predicting Compton-thick NH > 1.5 × 1024 cm−2 at the 3σ confidence level. The posterior median intrinsic X-ray luminosity in the 2–10 keV band was found to differ substantially, however, with values in the range log L2–10 keV/ erg s−1 = 40.9–42.1 for the individual models. We additionally show that the posterior distributions for each model occupy unique regions of their respective multidimensional parameter spaces and how such differences can propagate into the inferred properties of the central engine. We conclude by showcasing the improvement in parameter inference attainable with the High Energy X-ray Probe, with its uniquely broad, simultaneous, and high-sensitivity bandpass of 0.2–80 keV.

总结: 本文研究了快速无线电爆发（FRBs）的辐射物理，发现FRB 20201124A的窄带爆发在0.4–2 GHz活跃，并且其光谱峰频率主要集中在约1 GHz。通过FAST探测到的1268次FRB 20201124A爆发，研究表明约71.4%的事件的1σ光谱范围在FAST频段内。通过高斯函数拟合光谱曲线，很好地测量了固有爆发能量和光谱宽度。蒙特卡洛模拟分析推断了其固有峰频率分布和固有能量函数，并将结果与典型的重复FRB 20121102A和20190520B进行了比较。作者认为FRB 20201124A可能发生在一个精密调谐的等离子体中，这种等离子体能够产生窄频段的激射辐射，而FRB 20121102A和FRB 20190520B可能涉及多团块的等离子体条件，在广泛范围内产生几个特定频率的激射辐射。 <div>
The radiation physics of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains an open question. Current observations have discovered that narrowly banded bursts of FRB 20201124A are active in 0.4–2 GHz, and their spectral peak frequency ( ) is mostly toward ∼1 GHz. Utilizing a sample of 1268 bursts of FRB 20201124A detected with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we show that the 1σ spectral regime of 71.4% of the events (in-band bursts) is within the FAST bandpass. The intrinsic burst energies ( ) and spectral widths ( ) are well measured by fitting the spectral profile with a Gaussian function. The derived and distributions are lognormal and centered at and . Our Monte Carlo simulation analysis infers its intrinsic νp distribution as a normal function centered at νp,c = 1.16 GHz (σ = 0.22) and its intrinsic energy function as with Ec = 9.49 × 1037 erg. We compare these results with that of typical repeating FRBs 20121102A and 20190520B, which are active over a broad frequency range at several specific frequencies, and discuss possible observational biases on the estimation of the event rate and energy function. Based on these results, we argue that FRB 20201124A likely occurs in a fine-tuned plasma for maser radiation at a narrow frequency range, while FRB 20121102A and FRB 20190520B could involve clumpy plasma conditions that make maser emission around several specific frequencies in a broad range.

<div> TeV photons, gamma-ray bursts, Klein–Nishina effect, extragalactic background light, axion-like particles

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了GRB 221009A对目前我们对产生TeV光子的机制的理解提出的重大挑战。作者提出了大量的想法和假设，包括逆康普顿散射的Klein-Nishina效应导致高能电子的能量损失不够有效，以及外星际背景光的吸收效应等。他们还研究了TeV光子转化为轴子样粒子(ALPs)的可能性，并进行了参数空间的研究。此外，作者还考虑了EBL模型的不同假设，并给出了ALPs候选者的质量范围。这篇文章提出了一种探讨GRB中TeV光子产生机制的新思路，为相关研究领域提供了有益的信息。 <div>
GRB 221009A has posed a significant challenge to our current understanding of the mechanisms that produce TeV photons in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). On one hand, the Klein–Nishina (KN) effect of the inverse Compton scattering leads to less efficient energy losses of high-energy electrons. On the other hand, at a redshift of 0.151, the TeV spectrum of GRB 221009A undergoes significant absorption by the extragalactic background light (EBL). Therefore, the observation of a 13 TeV photon in this event implies the presence of enormous photon fluxes at the source, which the synchrotron self-Compton mechanism in external shocks cannot easily generate. As an alternative, some authors have suggested the possibility of converting the TeV photons into axion-like particles (ALPs) at the host galaxy, in order to avoid the effects of EBL absorption, and then reconverting them into photons within the Milky Way. While this solution relaxes the requirement of very high photon fluxes, the KN effect still poses a challenge. Previously, we have shown that the injections of ALPs could explain the observation of 13 TeV photons. Here, we include the energy dependence of the probability of survival and the amount of energy carried to determine the ALP candidates, which could potentially explain the TeV photons observed by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory and their hard spectrum. We found that the allowed candidates are generally clustered around masses of 10−7 eV. We also considered different EBL models, for the one predicting larger attenuation tends to reject ALP candidates with the lowest coupling factor. For some hypotheses of the EBL model, these candidates are found below a region of the parameter space in which, if detected, ALPs could account for all of the cold dark matter in the Universe.

<div> 红移、宇宙早期、星系形态、JWST望远镜、HR5模拟<br />  

研究利用HR5模拟预测了在宇宙的早期（10≳z≳4）星系的盘状形态在ΛCDM宇宙中占主导地位，这种形态是由物质初始波动中的潮汐力所驱动的。通过在公开发布的领域中利用深度JWST/NIRCam图像，识别了约19,000个JWST星系，并对其进行了对比观测，结果表明在各个红移范围下盘状星系占比60%-70%，但在高质量星系中，球状形态成为主导类型。这意味着星系的质量增长伴随着从盘状到球状的形态过渡。总体而言，星系的形态分布与HR5模拟得出的结果高度一致。这些结果进一步证实了在宇宙早期和正午时盘状星系占主导地位。 <br /><br />总结: <br />红移、宇宙早期、星系形态、JWST望远镜、HR5模拟。 <div>
A recent study from the Horizon Run 5 (HR5) cosmological simulation has predicted that galaxies with in the cosmic morning (10 ≳ z ≳ 4) dominantly have disk-like morphology in the ΛCDM universe, which is driven by the tidal torque in the initial fluctuations of matter. For a direct comparison with observation we identify a total of about 19,000 James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) galaxies with at z = 0.6–8.0 utilizing deep JWST/NIRCam images of publicly released fields, including North Ecliptic Pole Time-Domain Fields, Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public survey, Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey, Cosmic Evolution Survey, UltraDeep Survey, and SMACS J0723-7327. We estimate their stellar masses and photometric redshifts with the redshift dispersion of σNMAD = 0.009 and an outlier fraction of only about 6%. We classify galaxies into three morphological types, disks,spheroids, and irregulars, applying the same criteria used in the HR5 study. The morphological distribution of the JWST galaxies shows that disk galaxies account for 60%–70% at all redshift ranges. However, in the high-mass regime ( ), spheroidal morphology becomes the dominant type. This implies that the mass growth of galaxies is accompanied by a morphological transition from disks to spheroids. The fraction of irregulars is about 20% or less at all masses and redshifts. All the trends in the morphology distribution are consistently found in the six JWST fields. These results are in close agreement with the results from the HR5 simulation, particularly confirming the prevalence of disk galaxies at small masses in the cosmic morning and noon.

<title>Impact of Helium ii Resonant Absorption on the Ultraviolet Background Modeled in Three Dimensions</title>

<div> He ii absorption, reemission, UVB, cosmological simulations, reionization
<br /><br />总结:
本研究通过在宇宙学模拟中实施He ii吸收和再发射处理，研究其对三维宇宙超紫外背景（UVB）的影响。通过比较具有和没有He ii再处理的模拟，我们发现在He ii Lyman系列共振发生的3.5到4Ryd区间内，UVB平均值在z=10-5之间减弱了约3 dex。在过密区域，整体UVB幅度较高，He ii再处理的影响较小，表明在星系附近He ii再电离的早期开始。将我们的模拟与两种流行的一维UV模型进行比较，发现在z = 5时，能量高达3Ryd以上时，我们的模拟显示出更大的He ii吸收。H i和He ii再电离历史几乎不受He ii再处理的影响，尽管宇宙星系形成率密度受到了高达4%的改变。当考虑He ii时，C iv的宇宙质量密度减少了约2 dex，而Si iv、C ii、Mg ii、Si ii和O i则没有受到影响。 <div>
We implement a treatment of helium ii absorption and reemission into the Technicolor Dawn cosmological simulations to study its impact on the metagalactic ultraviolet background (UVB) in three dimensions. By comparing simulations with and without He ii reprocessing, we show that it weakens the mean UVB by ∼3 dex from z = 10–5 between 3.5 and 4 Ryd, where the He ii Lyman series resonance occurs. In overdense regions, the overall UVB amplitude is higher, and the impact of He ii reprocessing is weaker, qualitatively indicating an early start to He ii reionization near galaxies. Comparing our simulations to two popular one-dimensional UV models, we find good agreement up to 3 Ryd at z = 5. At higher energies, our simulation shows significantly greater He ii absorption because it accounts for He ii arising both in diffuse regions and in Lyman limit systems. By contrast, the comparison models account only for He ii in Lyman limit systems, which are subdominant prior to the completion of He ii reionization. The H i and He ii reionization histories are nearly unaffected by He ii reprocessing, although the cosmic star formation rate density is altered by up to 4%. The cosmic mass density of C iv is reduced by ∼2 dex when He ii is accounted for, while Si iv, C ii, Mg ii, Si ii, and O i are unaffected.

<title>Morphology and Kinematics of the Gas in M51: How Interaction with NGC 5195 Has Molded the Structure of Its Arms</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Whirlpool Galaxy is a well-studied grand design galaxy with two major spiral arms, and a large satellite NGC 5195. The arms both show long uniform sections with perturbations (“kinks” or sharp turns) in specific regions. Comparing the two arms shows a small radial offset between the main kinked regions. We analyzed the morphology and also the velocity field in the disk of M51 using kinematic maps based on Hα and CO line emission. These sample complementary radial ranges, with the CO map covering the central zone and the Hα map extending to cover the outer zone. We looked for indicators of density wave resonance, zones where radial flows of gas in the disk plane reverse their sign. These were present in both velocity maps; their 2D localization placed them along or closely parallel to the spiral arms, at a set of well-defined galactocentric radii, and notably more concentrated along the southern, stronger arm. The results can be well interpreted quantitatively, using a numerical model of the interaction of M51 and NGC 5195 in which the satellite has made two relatively recent passes through the disk plane of M51. During the first pass the pair of dominant spiral arms was stimulated, and during the second pass the strong kinks in both arms were formed at about the same time. The second interaction is particularly well characterized, because the timescale corresponding to the production of the kinks and the recovery of the original pitch angle is identical for the two arms.

<title>Mining the GALAH Data. I. Study of Five Super Lithium-rich Metal-poor Giants</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The presence of a large amount of Li in giants is still a mystery. Most of the super Li-rich (SLR) giants reported in recent studies are in the solar metallicity regime. Here, we study the five metal-poor SLRs from the Galactic Archeology with HERMES Data Release 3, with their [Fe/H] ranging from −1.35 to −2.38 with lithium abundance of A(Li) ≥ 3.4 dex. The asteroseismic analysis reveals that none are on the red giant branch. The average period spacing (ΔP ) values indicate giants are in the core He-burning phase. All of them are low-mass giants (M < 1.5 M⊙). Their location in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram suggests one of them is in the red clump (RC) phase, and interestingly, the other four are much brighter and coincide with the early asymptotic giant branch phase. The analysis of the abundance reveals that C, O, Na, Ba, and Eu are normal in giants of respective metallicities and evolutionary phases. Further, we did not find any strong evidence of the presence of dust in the form of infrared excess or binarity from the available radial velocity data. We discuss a few scenarios for the existence of SLRs at higher luminosity, including past merger events. Our findings will help in understanding the production and evolution of Li among giants, in particular, during the RC phase and the post-RC phase.

The third data release (DR3) of Gaia has provided a fivefold increase in the number of radial velocity measurements of stars, as well as a stark improvement in parallax and proper motion measurements. To help with studies that seek to test models and interpret Gaia DR3, we present nine Gaia synthetic surveys, based on three solar positions in three Milky Way-mass galaxies of the Latte suite of the Fire-2 cosmological simulations. These synthetic surveys match the selection function, radial velocity measurements, and photometry of Gaia DR3, adapting the code base Ananke, previously used to match the Gaia DR2 release by Sanderson et al. The synthetic surveys are publicly available and can be found at http://ananke.hub.yt/. Similarly to the previous release of Ananke, these surveys are based on cosmological simulations and thus are able to model nonequilibrium dynamical effects, making them a useful tool in testing and interpreting Gaia DR3.

<title>Inferring Properties of Dark Galactic Halos Using Strongly Lensed Gravitational Waves</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad35bb</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Gravitational waves (GWs) can be deflected, similarly to electromagnetic (EM) waves, by massive objects through the phenomenon of gravitational lensing. The importance of GW lensing for GW astronomy is becoming increasingly apparent in the GW detection era, in which nearly 100 events have already been detected. As current ground-based interferometers reach their design sensitivities, it is anticipated that these detectors may observe a few GW signals that are strongly lensed by the dark halos of intervening galaxies or galaxy clusters. Analyzing the strong lensing effects on GW signals is, thus, becoming important to understand the lens’ properties and correctly infer the intrinsic GW source parameters. However, one cannot accurately infer lens parameters for complex lens models with only GW observations because there are strong degeneracies between the parameters of lensed waveforms. In this paper, we discuss how to conduct parameter estimation of strongly lensed GW signals and infer the lens parameters using additional EM information, including the lens galaxy’s axis ratio and the GW source-hosting galaxy’s lensed images. We find that for simple spherically symmetric lens models, the lens parameters can be well recovered using only GW information. On the other hand, recovering the lens parameters requires systems in which four or more GW images are detected with additional EM observations for nonaxially symmetric lens models. Combinations of GW and EM observations can further improve the inference of the lens parameters.

<title>Empirical Models of the Hβ Broad Emission Line Gas Density Field</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the second iteration of the caramel-gas code, an empirical model of the broad-line region (BLR) gas density field. Building on the initial development and testing of caramel-gas, we expand the meaning of the model parameter α, which initially represented only the power-law index of the dependency of emissivity on radial distance. In this work, we test a more generalized radial power-law index, α, that also includes a description of the effective emitting size(s) of the BLR structure as a function of radial distance. We select a sample of 10 active galactic nuclei (AGN) from three different Lick AGN Monitoring Project campaigns to further validate the caramel-gas code and test the generalized radial power-law index, α. Our results confirm that the caramel-gas results are in general agreement with the published results determined using the original caramel code, further demonstrating that our forward modeling method is robust. We find that a positive radial power-law index is generally favored and propose three possible scenarios: (i) the BLR structure has increasing effective emitting size(s) at larger radial distances from the central source, (ii) emission is concentrated at the outer edges of the BLR, and (iii) stronger theoretical assumptions are needed to break the degeneracies inherent to the interpretation of reverberation mapping data in terms of underlying gas properties.

<title>Comparing Recent Pulsar Timing Array Results on the Nanohertz Stochastic Gravitational-wave Background</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad36be</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Australian, Chinese, European, Indian, and North American pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations recently reported, at varying levels, evidence for the presence of a nanohertz gravitational-wave background (GWB). Given that each PTA made different choices in modeling their data, we perform a comparison of the GWB and individual pulsar noise parameters across the results reported from the PTAs that constitute the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA). We show that despite making different modeling choices, there is no significant difference in the GWB parameters that are measured by the different PTAs, agreeing within 1σ. The pulsar noise parameters are also consistent between different PTAs for the majority of the pulsars included in these analyses. We bridge the differences in modeling choices by adopting a standardized noise model for all pulsars and PTAs, finding that under this model there is a reduction in the tension in the pulsar noise parameters. As part of this reanalysis, we “extended” each PTA’s data set by adding extra pulsars that were not timed by that PTA. Under these extensions, we find better constraints on the GWB amplitude and a higher signal-to-noise ratio for the Hellings–Downs correlations. These extensions serve as a prelude to the benefits offered by a full combination of data across all pulsars in the IPTA, i.e., the IPTA’s Data Release 3, which will involve not just adding in additional pulsars but also including data from all three PTAs where any given pulsar is timed by more than a single PTA.

<title>NuSTAR Observations of Candidate Subparsec Binary Supermassive Black Holes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present an analysis of NuSTAR X-ray observations of three active galactic nuclei (AGN) that were identified as candidate subparsec binary supermassive black hole (SMBH) systems in the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey based on apparent periodicity in their optical light curves. Simulations predict that close-separation accreting SMBH binaries will have different X-ray spectra than single accreting SMBHs. We previously observed these AGN with Chandra and found no differences between their low-energy X-ray properties and the larger AGN population. However, some models predict differences to be more prominent at energies higher than probed by Chandra. We find that even at the higher energies probed by NuSTAR, the spectra of these AGN are indistinguishable from the larger AGN population. This could rule out models predicting large differences in the X-ray spectra in the NuSTAR bands. Alternatively, it might mean that these three AGN are not binary SMBHs.

<title>Morphology and Mach Number Dependence of Subsonic Bondi–Hoyle Accretion</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We carry out three-dimensional computations of the accretion rate onto an object (of size Rsink and mass m) as it moves through a uniform medium at a subsonic speed v∞. The object is treated as a fully absorbing boundary (e.g., a black hole). In contrast to early conjectures, we show that for an accretor with in a gaseous medium with adiabatic index γ = 5/3, the accretion rate is independent of Mach number and is determined only by m and the gas entropy. Our numerical simulations are conducted using two different numerical schemes via the Athena++ and Arepo hydrodynamics solvers, which reach nearly identical steady-state solutions. We find that pressure gradients generated by the isentropic compression of the flow near the accretor are sufficient to suspend much of the surrounding gas in a near-hydrostatic equilibrium, just as predicted from the spherical Bondi–Hoyle calculation. Indeed, the accretion rates for steady flow match the Bondi–Hoyle rate, and are indicative of isentropic flow for subsonic motion where no shocks occur. We also find that the accretion drag may be predicted using the Safronov number, Θ = RA/Rsink, and is much less than the dynamical friction for sufficiently small accretors (Rsink ≪ RA).

<title>The Temperature and Density of a Solar Flare Kernel Measured from Extreme-ultraviolet Lines of O iv</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Previously unexplored diagnostics of O iv in the extreme-ultraviolet region 260–280 Å are used to derive a temperature and density for a solar flare kernel observed on 2012 March 9 with the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer on the Hinode satellite. Seven lines from the 2s2p2–2s2p3s transition array between 271.99 and 272.31 Å are both temperature- and density-sensitive relative to the line at 279.93 Å. The temperature, T, is constrained with the λ268.02/λ279.93 ratio, giving a value of . The ratio λ272.13/λ279.93 then yields an electron number density, Ne, of with a lower limit of 11.90 and an upper limit of 14.40. The O iv emitting volume is estimated to be 0.″4 (300 km) across. Additional O iv lines at 196, 207, and 260 Å are consistent with the derived temperature and density but have larger uncertainties from the radiometric calibration and blending. Density diagnostics of O v and Mg vii from the same spectrum are consistent with a constant pressure of 1017.0 K cm−3 through the transition region. The temperature derived from O iv supports recent results that O iv is formed around 0.10 dex lower at high densities compared to standard zero-density ionization balance calculations.

<title>Contribution of Neutrino-dominated Accretion Flows to the Cosmic MeV Neutrino Background</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs) are one of the important MeV neutrino sources and significantly contribute to the cosmic diffuse neutrino background. In this paper, we investigate the spectrum of the diffuse NDAF neutrino background (DNNB) by fully considering the effects of the progenitor properties and initial explosion energies based on core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations, and estimate the detectable event rate by the Super-Kamiokande detector. We find that the predicted background neutrino flux is mainly determined by the typical CCSN initial explosion energy and progenitor metallicity. For the optimistic cases, in which the typical initial explosion energy is low, the diffuse flux of the DNNB is comparable to the diffuse supernova neutrino background, which might be detected by upcoming larger neutrino detectors, such as Hyper-Kamiokande, the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory, and the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment. Moreover, the strong outflows from NDAFs could dramatically decrease their contribution to the neutrino background.

<title>Galaxy Spin Transition Driven by the Misalignments between the Protogalaxy Inertia and Initial Tidal Tensors</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A numerical detection of the τ-driven transition of galaxy spins is presented, where τ is the degree of misalignment between the initial tidal field and protogalaxy inertia tensors. Analyzing the data from the IllustrisTNG300-1 simulations, we first measure the values of τ at the protogalactic sites found by tracing the constituents of the galactic halos in the mass range of back to the initial stage, zi = 127. The probability density functions of τ are shown to be well modeled by the Γ-distributions, whose shape and scale parameters turn out to have universal values on a certain critical scale. Then, we investigate how the strength and tendency of the galaxy spin alignments with the principal axes of the local tidal fields depend on the initial condition, τ. It is found that on a scale lower than the critical one, the galaxy spin transition occurs at two different thresholds from the major to intermediate and from the intermediate to minor principal axes of the local tidal fields, respectively. Noting that the τ-dependent spin transition supersedes the strength of the previously found mass-dependent, morphology-dependent, and radius-dependent counterparts, we suggest that τ should be the key driver of all types of galaxy spin transitions and that the present galaxy spins are indeed excellent fossil records of their origin.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The particle acceleration of blazar jets is crucial to high-energy astrophysics, yet the acceleration mechanism division in blazar subclasses and the underlying nature of these mechanisms remain elusive. In this work, we utilized the synchrotron spectral information (synchrotron peak frequency, , and corresponding curvature, bsy) of 2705 blazars from the literature and studied the subject of particle acceleration in blazar jets by analyzing the correlation between and 1/bsy. Our results suggested that the entire sample follows an energy-dependent probability acceleration (EDPA). Specifically, the low inverse Compton peak sources (LCPs) follow the mechanism of fluctuations of fractional gain acceleration (FFGA), while the high inverse Compton peak sources (HCPs) follow an acceleration mechanism of EDPA. Our results indicated that the separation between LCPs and HCPs results from the electron peak Lorentz factor (γp), and the differentiation should originate from different acceleration mechanisms. Moreover, our study revealed a transition in the acceleration mechanism from FFGA to EDPA around through a detailed analysis of binned- . The mechanism of FFGA dominates the particle acceleration in LCP jets because of stronger jets and the EDPA dominates the particle energy gain in the HCPs due to a more efficient acceleration process.

<title>Scattering Cross Sections of Magnetized Particles within Intense Electromagnetic Waves: Application to Fast Radio Bursts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recently, Beloborodov suggested that there exists a resonance phenomenon between an extremely intense electromagnetic wave and internal magnetized particles. The particles exchange energy with the wave at frequent resonance events and then reach the radiation reaction limit immediately. This process greatly enhances the scattering cross section of the particles. Note that these results only involve an extraordinary (X) mode wave. In this paper, we focus on an intense ordinary (O) mode wave propagating through magnetized particles and compare it with the case of the X-mode wave. Our result shows that the scattering cross section of the particles in the O-mode wave is significantly smaller than that in the X-mode wave. This has important implications for the transparency of a fast radio burst (FRB) inside the magnetosphere of a magnetar. We argue that there is a strong scattering region in the stellar magnetosphere, within which an O-mode wave is more transparent than an X-mode wave for an FRB.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In 2019, the Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER) mission released its findings on the mass and radius of the isolated neutron star (INS) PSR J0030+0451, revealing a mass of approximately 1.4 solar masses (M⊙) and a radius near 13 km. However, the recent reanalysis by the NICER collaboration suggests that the available data primarily yield a precise inference of the compactness for this source while the resulting mass and radius are strongly model-dependent and diverse (the 68.3% credible regions just overlap slightly for the ST+PDT and PDT-U models). By integrating this compactness data with the equation of state (EOS) refined by our latest investigations, we have deduced the mass and radius for PSR J0030+0451, delivering estimates of and for the compactness found in the ST+PDT model, alongside and for the compactness in the PDT-U model. These two groups of results are well consistent with each other and the direct X-ray data inference within the ST+PDT model seems to be favored. Additionally, we have calculated the tidal deformability, moment of inertia, and gravitational binding energy for this neutron star. Furthermore, employing these refined EOS models, we have updated mass–radius estimates for three INSs with established gravitational redshifts.

<title>An Angular Diameter Measurement of β UMa via Stellar Intensity Interferometry with the VERITAS Observatory</title>

We use the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging telescope Array System (VERITAS) imaging air Cherenkov telescope array to obtain the first measured angular diameter of β UMa at visual wavelengths using stellar intensity interferometry (SII) and independently constrain the limb-darkened angular diameter. The age of the Ursa Major moving group has been assessed from the ages of its members, including nuclear member Merak (β UMa), an A1-type subgiant, by comparing effective temperature and luminosity constraints to model stellar evolution tracks. Previous interferometric limb-darkened angular-diameter measurements of β UMa in the near-infrared (Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) Array, 1.149 ± 0.014 mas) and mid-infrared (Keck Nuller, 1.08 ± 0.07 mas), together with the measured parallax and bolometric flux, have constrained the effective temperature. This paper presents current VERITAS-SII observation and analysis procedures to derive squared visibilities from correlation functions. We fit the resulting squared visibilities to find a limb-darkened angular diameter of 1.07 ± 0.04 (stat) ± 0.05 (sys) mas, using synthetic visibilities from a stellar atmosphere model that provides a good match to the spectrum of β UMa in the optical wave band. The VERITAS-SII limb-darkened angular diameter yields an effective temperature of 9700 ± 200 ± 200 K, consistent with ultraviolet spectrophotometry, and an age of 390 ± 29 ± 32 Myr, using MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks. This age is consistent with 408 ± 6 Myr from the CHARA Array angular diameter.

<div> 观测量、星系旋转曲线、气体表面密度、恒星表面密度、星际介质湍流
总结:
该研究开发了一个模型，使用可观测的数量作为输入参数，如星系旋转曲线、气体、恒星和恒星形成率的表面密度，以及气体温度。模型可以用来估计磁场的随机和平均分量的参数，以及气体尺度高度、均方根速度和星际湍流的相关长度和时间，从观测量的角度来看。研究还评估了结果对湍流驱动不同假设的依赖性，并发现通过明确建模超新星遗迹的扩展和能量，可以改善与观测的一致性。该模型具有足够的灵活性，可以包括涉及的物理过程的替代方案，并提供两个实施该模型的开源Python程序的链接。 <div>
Galactic dynamo models have generally relied on input parameters that are very challenging to constrain. We address this problem by developing a model that uses observable quantities as input: the galaxy rotation curve, the surface densities of the gas, stars and star formation rate, and the gas temperature. The model can be used to estimate parameters of the random and mean components of the magnetic field, as well as the gas scale height, root-mean-square velocity and the correlation length and time of the interstellar turbulence, in terms of the observables. We use our model to derive theoretical scaling relations for the quantities of interest, finding reasonable agreement with empirical scaling relations inferred from observation. We assess the dependence of the results on different assumptions about turbulence driving, finding that agreement with observations is improved by explicitly modeling the expansion and energetics of supernova remnants. The model is flexible enough to include alternative prescriptions for the physical processes involved, and we provide links to two open-source python programs that implement it.

<div> NLS1s, AGNs, jets, radio emission, mid-infrared<br />
总结:<br />
本文研究了NLS1s的中红外特性，发现它们与射电暴星系和星暴星系在MIR颜色-颜色图中有重叠，但与SFGs和光学选择的射电星系有很大差别。同时发现NLS1s的射电和MIR辐射都受AGN活动的显著影响。一小部分射电亮度较高的NLS1s在射电-MIR图中与类星体相似，这说明它们的射电辐射由喷流主导。通过射电-MIR图中的射电过剩，发现了一些潜在的具有喷流的NLS1候选体。 <div>
Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s), a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in an early stage of the accretion process, are also found to host relativistic jets. However, currently known jetted NLS1s are rare. The majority of NLS1s are undetected at the radio band. The radio detection rate of NLS1s increases with the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS), which provides a good opportunity for finding more jetted NLS1s. The better sensitivity raises the question whether the radio emission of NLS1s with a low radio luminosity originates from the jet activity. In order to clarify the origin of the radio emission for NLS1s and search for more jetted NLS1s, we explore the mid-infrared properties of LoTSS-detected NLS1s by comparing them with known jetted AGNs and star-forming galaxies (SFGs), which are located above and on the well-studied radio/far-infrared correlation, respectively. The majority of NLS1s show mid-infrared (MIR) excess compared with SFGs. Their radio emission shows a significant correlation with the MIR emission. In the MIR color–color diagram, NLS1s overlap flat spectrum radio quasars, but they are well separated from SFGs and optically selected radio galaxies. The flux ratio of the radio and MIR emission of these NLS1s is also similar to that of a radio-quiet quasar with a weak jet. These results imply substantial contributions from the AGN activities for both the radio and MIR emission of NLS1s. A small fraction of NLS1s with relatively higher radio luminosities are located in a similar region as blazars in the radio-MIR diagram, which suggests that the radio emission of these NLS1s is dominated by the jet. We obtain a sample of jetted NLS1 candidates through their radio excess in the radio-MIR diagram.

<title>GN-z11 in Context: Possible Signatures of Globular Cluster Precursors at Redshift 10</title>

<div> 高红移星系、JWST光谱、氮元素、恒星形成、化学丰度<br />
<br />总结:
这篇文章介绍了对高红移星系GN-z11的JWST光谱分析结果。研究发现，该星系的光谱显示了高度电离的氮元素特征，并通过星云建模测量了星云密度。研究人员还使用光电离模型和地球附近的低金属丰度星系进行比较，发现星系中氮气含量丰富，并认为这可能是密集星系中强烈星形成的独特标志。这些结果为高红移星系中的星团形成和化学丰度提供了新的见解。 <div>
The first JWST spectroscopy of the luminous galaxy GN-z11 simultaneously established its redshift at z = 10.6 and revealed a rest-ultraviolet spectrum dominated by signatures of highly ionized nitrogen, which has so far defied clear interpretation. We present a reappraisal of this spectrum in the context of both detailed nebular modeling and nearby metal-poor reference galaxies. The N iv] emission enables the first nebular density measurement in an apparently predominantly star-forming galaxy at z > 10, revealing evidence for extremely high densities ne ≳ 105 cm−3. With a suite of photoionization models, we establish that regardless of the ionization mechanism and accounting for depletion and this density enhancement, gas substantially enriched in nitrogen ([N/O] = +0.52 assuming the nebular emission is dominated by star formation) is required to reproduce the observed lines. We compare the GN-z11 spectrum to local UV databases and highlight a unique nearby galaxy, Mrk 996, where a high concentration of Wolf–Rayet stars and their CNO-processed ejecta produce a UV spectrum remarkably similar in some respects to that of GN-z11 and the Sunburst Arc. Collating this evidence in the context of Galactic stellar abundances, we suggest that the peculiar nitrogenic features prominent in GN-z11 may be a unique signature of intense and densely clustered star formation in the evolutionary chain of the present-day globular clusters, consistent with in situ early enrichment with nuclear-processed stellar ejecta on a massive scale. Combined with insight from local galaxies, these and future JWST data open a powerful new window into the physical conditions of star formation and chemical enrichment at the highest redshifts.

<div> 频率依赖、脉冲星定时、差异传播、时间误差、色散建模
总结:
本研究通过对宽带观测数据和窄带观测数据进行对比分析，发现使用减少频率范围会引入系统偏差。我们发现对于DM值较高的脉冲星，由于频率采样不完整造成的无穷频率到达时间会存在约22微秒的偏移，并且在约一个月的时间尺度上存在相关性。对于DM值较低的脉冲星，这个偏移约为7微秒。这种误差的量化可以用于在NANOGrav数据中提供更加健壮的噪声建模，从而提高灵敏度和改善引力波搜索中的参数估计。 <div>
Noise characterization for pulsar-timing applications accounts for interstellar dispersion by assuming a known frequency dependence of the delay it introduces in the times of arrival (TOAs). However, calculations of this delay suffer from misestimations due to other chromatic effects in the observations. The precision in modeling dispersion is dependent on the observed bandwidth. In this work, we calculate the offsets in infinite-frequency TOAs due to misestimations in the modeling of dispersion when using varying bandwidths at the Green Bank Telescope. We use a set of broadband observations of PSR J1643−1224, a pulsar with unusual chromatic timing behavior. We artificially restricted these observations to a narrowband frequency range, then used both the broad- and narrowband data sets to calculate residuals with a timing model that does not account for time variations in the dispersion. By fitting the resulting residuals to a dispersion model and comparing the fits, we quantify the error introduced in the timing parameters due to using a reduced frequency range. Moreover, by calculating the autocovariance function of the parameters, we obtained a characteristic timescale over which the dispersion misestimates are correlated. For PSR J1643−1224, which has one of the highest dispersion measures (DM) in the NANOGrav pulsar timing array, we find that the infinite-frequency TOAs suffer from a systematic offset of ∼22 μs due to incomplete frequency sampling, with correlations over about one month. For lower-DM pulsars, the offset is ∼7 μs. This error quantification can be used to provide more robust noise modeling in the NANOGrav data, thereby increasing the sensitivity and improving the parameter estimation in gravitational wave searches.

<div> Class 0 protostars, K-band spectra, accretion, Brγ emission, CO overtone emission
<br />
通过对26个Class 0原恒星的K波段光谱进行分析，发现了H i Brγ、H2和CO Δv = 2特征的检测和分析。Brγ发射在62%的源中检测到，CO overtone发射在50%的源中检测到，而H2发射在90%的源中检测到。H i和CO发射与吸积有关，而H2线与激波激发一致，表明存在喷流/流出。另外，六个物体表现出光球吸收特征，几乎没有流出活动，并且未检测到与吸积相关的Brγ发射线。将这些结果与Class I K-band光谱的文献样本进行比较，发现Class 0中CO和Brγ发射线的发射量普遍更大，这表明Class 0阶段的吸积平均更为激烈。Class 0中CO overtone发射的更高检测率通常与加热的内部吸积盘相关，表明Class 0系统中更频繁出现高吸积活动的阶段。Class 0 CO overtone发射的动力学特征表明，可能存在吸积加热的内部盘或物质直接落入中心区域的情况。这可能指向Class 0系统中不同性质的吸积机制，不同于 typica中幅卫星吸积的典型图片。<br /><br />总结:  这项研究分析了Class 0原恒星的K波段光谱，发现了吸积和喷流活动的迹象，并发现Class 0阶段的吸积更为激烈，并且更频繁出现高吸积活动的情况。此外，Class 0系统中可能存在着不同于typica中幅卫星吸积的吸积机制。 <div>
Sun-like stars are thought to accrete most of their final mass during the protostellar phase, during which the stellar embryo is surrounded by an infalling dense envelope. We present an analysis of 26 K-band spectra of Class 0 protostars, which are the youngest protostars. Of these, 18 are new observations made with the Keck MOSFIRE instrument. H i Brγ, several H2, and CO Δv = 2 features are detected and analyzed. We detect Brγ emission in 62%, CO overtone emission in 50%, and H2 emission in 90% of sources. The H i and CO emission is associated with accretion, while the H2 lines are consistent with shock excitation indicating jets/outflows. Six objects exhibit photospheric absorption features, with almost no outflow activity and no detection of the accretion-related Brγ emission line. Comparing these results with an archival sample of Class I K-band spectra, we find that the CO and Brγ emission lines are systematically more luminous in Class 0s, suggesting that the accretion is on average more vigorous in the Class 0 phase. Typically associated with the heated inner accretion disk, the much higher detection rate of CO overtone emission in Class 0s indicates also that episodes of high accretion activity are more frequent in Class 0 systems. The kinematics of the Class 0 CO overtone emission suggest either an accretion-heated inner disk or material directly infalling onto the central region. This could point toward an accretion mechanism of different nature in Class 0 systems than the typical picture of magnetospheric accretion.

<div> 关键词: protoplanetary disk turbulence, ansatz, Shakura–Sunyaev α parameter, Keplerian frequency, particle collision dynamics

总结:<br /><br />本文讨论了原行星盘湍流的理论，并探讨了一个广泛采用的假设，即最大湍流涡的周转频率ΩL等于局部开普勒频率ΩK的假设。文章指出这种假设不适用于数值强迫湍流或由自然过程驱动的情况。作者提出了更一般的情况，并研究了当ΩL ≥ ΩK时的特征长度和速度比例。文章还提到了在这种情况下的影响，对粒子碰撞动力学、成长以及行星形成等方面产生了重要影响。文章的研究有助于解释近期对边缘盘的观测，并对观测结果有着更一般的影响。 <div>
In the theory of protoplanetary disk turbulence, a widely adopted ansatz, or assumption, is that the turnover frequency of the largest turbulent eddy, ΩL, is the local Keplerian frequency ΩK. In terms of the standard dimensionless Shakura–Sunyaev α parameter that quantifies turbulent viscosity or diffusivity, this assumption leads to characteristic length and velocity scales given respectively by and , in which H and c are the local gas scale height and sound speed. However, this assumption is not applicable in cases when turbulence is forced numerically or driven by some natural processes such as vertical shear instability. Here, we explore the more general case where ΩL ≥ ΩK and show that, under these conditions, the characteristic length and velocity scales are respectively and , where is twice the Rossby number. It follows that , where is the root-mean-square average of the turbulent velocities. Properly allowing for this effect naturally explains the reduced particle scale heights produced in shearing box simulations of particles in forced turbulence, and it may help with interpreting recent edge-on disk observations; more general implications for observations are also presented. For , the effective particle Stokes numbers are increased, which has implications for particle collision dynamics and growth, as well as for planetesimal formation.

<div> 红巨星分支、JWST、F090W、NGC 4258、银河系距离测量
总结:
红巨星分支（TRGB）是利用低质量红巨星在氦闪之前的最亮上升来测量邻近星系精确距离的技术。JWST的出现使得该技术可以测量至少50 Mpc的星系距离，大大超过HST的20 Mpc的范围。使用F090W滤光片的绝对校准提供了TRGB测量的绝对参考。NGC 4258的图像数据提供了直接的几何距离测量，利用几种测量技术，得到了金属贫乏TRGB为-4.362 ± 0.033 (stat) ± 0.045 (sys)等级（vega）的结果。对NGC 1559和NGC 5584进行的TRGB测量与以前用Cepheids方法测得的距离结果一致。此外，还意外发现了NGC 5584附近的一个微弱的矮星系。 <div>
The tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) allows for the measurement of precise and accurate distances to nearby galaxies based on the brightest ascent of low-mass red giant branch stars before they undergo the helium flash. With the advent of JWST, there is great promise to utilize the technique to measure galaxy distances out to at least 50 Mpc, significantly further than the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST's) reach of 20 Mpc. However, with any standard candle, it is first necessary to provide an absolute reference. Here, we use Cycle 1 data to provide an absolute calibration in the F090W filter. F090W is most similar to the F814W filter commonly used for TRGB measurements with HST, which had been adopted by the community due to its minimal dependence on the underlying metallicities and ages of stars. The imaging we use was taken in the outskirts of NGC 4258, which has a direct geometrical distance measurement from the Keplerian motion of its water megamaser. Utilizing several measurement techniques, we find = −4.362 ± 0.033 (stat) ± 0.045 (sys) mag (Vega) for the metal-poor TRGB. We also perform measurements of the TRGB in two Type Ia supernova hosts, NGC 1559 and NGC 5584. We find good agreement between our TRGB distances and previous determinations of distances to these galaxies from Cepheids (Δ = 0.01 ± 0.06 mag), with these differences being too small to explain the Hubble tension (∼0.17 mag). In addition, we showcase the serendipitous discovery of a faint dwarf galaxy near NGC 5584.

We develop the impulsiveness index, a new classification system for solar flares using the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Extreme Ultraviolet Experiment 304 Å Sun-as-a-star light curves. Impulsiveness classifies events based on the duration and intensity of the initial high-energy deposition of energy into the chromosphere. In stellar flare U-band light curves, Kowalski et al. found that impulsiveness is related to quantities such as a proxy for the Balmer jump ratio. However, the lack of direct spatial resolution in stellar flares limits our ability to explain this phenomenon. We calculate impulsiveness for 1368 solar flares between 2010 April and 2014 May. We divide events into categories of low, mid, and high impulsiveness. We find, in a sample of 480 flares, that events with high maximum reconnection rate tend to also have high impulsiveness. For six case studies, we compare impulsiveness to magnetic shear, ribbon evolution, and energy release. We find that the end of the 304 Å light-curve rise phase in these case studies corresponds to the cessation of polarity inversion line (PIL)-parallel ribbon motion, while PIL-perpendicular motion persists afterward in most cases. The measured guide-field ratio for low- and mid-impulsiveness case-study flares decreases about an order of magnitude during the impulsive flare phase. Finally, we find that, in four of the six case studies, flares with higher, more persistent shear tend to have low impulsiveness. Our study suggests that impulsiveness may be related to other properties of the impulsive phase, though more work is needed to verify this relationship and apply our findings to stellar flare physics.

We have imaged the entirety of eight (plus one partial) Milky Way (MW)–like satellite systems, a total of 42 (45) satellites, from the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs II catalog in both Hα and H i with the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope and the Jansky Very Large Array. In these eight systems we have identified four cases where a satellite appears to be currently undergoing ram pressure stripping (RPS) as its H i gas collides with the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of its host. We also see a clear suppression of gas fraction (MHI/M*) with decreasing (projected) satellite–host separation—to our knowledge, the first time this has been observed in a sample of MW-like systems. Comparisons to the Auriga, A Project Of Simulating The Local Environment, and TNG50 cosmological zoom-in simulations show consistent global behavior, but they systematically underpredict gas fractions across all satellites by roughly 0.5 dex. Using a simplistic RPS model, we estimate the average peak CGM density that satellites in these systems have encountered to be . Furthermore, we see tentative evidence that these satellites are following a specific star formation rate to gas fraction relation that is distinct from field galaxies. Finally, we detect one new gas-rich satellite in the UGC 903 system with an optical size and surface brightness meeting the standard criteria to be considered an ultra-diffuse galaxy.

Plasma flow–obstacle interactions, such as those between an exoplanet’s magnetosphere and the host star’s stellar wind, may lead to detectable radio emissions. Despite many attempts to detect magnetospheric (auroral) radio emissions from exoplanets, a reproducible, unambiguous detection remains elusive. This fourth paper of the Radio Observations of Magnetized Exoplanets (ROME) series presents the results of a targeted radio survey of nine nearby systems that host exoplanet, brown dwarf, or low-mass-stellar companions conducted with the Arecibo radio telescope at ∼5 GHz. This search for magnetospheric radio emissions has the greatest sensitivity (∼1 mJy during <1 s integration times) and collected full Stokes parameters over the largest simultaneous bandpass of any survey to date. It is also the first survey to search for radio emission from brown dwarfs of spectral class Y, which may illuminate open questions regarding their magnetism, interior and atmospheric structure, and formation histories. No magnetospheric radio emissions from substellar companions were detected. These results are examined within the context of recent theoretical work on plasma flow–obstacle interactions, and radio emissions observed from the solar system planets and ultracool dwarfs.

<div> DMDGs, UDGs, Mini-Bullet scenario, NGC 1052, ΛCDM simulation
总结:
通过对超弥漫星系的调查，发现了缺乏暗物质的星系（DMDGs），这与标准冷暗物质理论存在冲突。研究表明，高速星系碰撞（Mini-Bullet场景）可能是这些星系形成的原因。最近观察到了在NGC 1052附近的7-11个UDGs的轨迹，并推测它们在大约89亿年前共同形成。通过模拟和星系轨道计算，发现主星系外的卫星星系碰撞可以复制NGC 1052星系组中观察到的UDGs。这些结果表明，目前的观测与Mini-Bullet场景是一致的。 <div>
Dark-matter-deficient galaxies (DMDGs) discovered in the survey of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs), in apparent conflict with standard cold dark matter, may be produced by high-velocity galaxy–galaxy collisions, the so-called Mini-Bullet scenario. Recent observations of an aligned trail of 7–11 UDGs near NGC 1052, including DMDGs DF2 and DF4, suggesting a common formation event, ∼8.9 ± 1.5 Gyr ago, provide a test.Hydro/N-body simulations, supplemented by galaxy orbit integrations, demonstrate that satellite–satellite collisions outside the host-galaxy virial radius can reproduce the observed UDGs in the NGC 1052 group. A trail of ∼10 DMDGs is shown to form, including 2 massive ones that replicate the observed motions of DF2 and DF4. The linear relation, v = Ax + v0, conjectured previously to relate positions (x) and velocities (v) of the aligned DMDGs as a signature of the collision event, is approximately obeyed, but individual DMDGs can deviate significantly from it. The progenitors whose collision spawned the trail of DMDGs survive the collision without themselves becoming DMDGs. We predict that one progenitor is located at the end of the trail, which can be tested by observing the difference between its stars, formed pre-collision, from those of the DMDGs, formed post-collision. By contrast, stellar ages and metallicities of the DMDGs are nearly identical. We further offer a hint that the tidal field of host NGC 1052 may contribute to making DMDGs diffuse. ΛCDM simulation in a 100 cMpc box finds our required initial conditions ∼10 times at z < 3. These results indicate current observations are consistent with the Mini-Bullet scenario.

<div> 关键词：太阳风，磁场，功率谱密度，传播角度，哈廷函数

总结：本研究通过Voyager 2号探测器的磁场测量数据，在1到33天文单位的距离范围内研究了惯性范围太阳风等离子体湍流的径向演化和各向异性。研究发现，垂直和迹向磁场功率谱密度仍然遵循科尔莫哥洛夫谱直至33天文单位。与此同时，平行磁场功率谱密度在穿越10天文单位时从-2的幂律指数过渡到-5/3。在20天文单位后，频率在0.01赫兹到0.2赫兹范围内的功率谱密度逐渐变平，逼近f^(-1)谱。在频率低于0.01赫兹时，由于传播角度小于20°的波能级增强，功率谱密度随传播角度减小而减小。这种增强可能来源于离子加速的波能量注入背景湍流级联中，并且注入的波能量在各个尺度间传递，没有留下局部的功率密度或功率谱密度增强。 <br /><br /> <div>
We study the radial evolution of the inertial-range solar wind plasma turbulence and its anisotropy in the outer heliosphere. We use magnetic field (B) measurements from the Voyager 2 spacecraft for heliocentric distances R from 1 to 33 au. We find that the perpendicular and trace power spectral densities (PSDs) of the magnetic field ( and ) still follow a Kolmogorov-like spectrum until 33 au. The parallel magnetic field PSD, , transits from a power-law index of −2 to −5/3 as the distance crosses R ∼ 10 au. The PSD at frequencies 0.01 Hz < f < 0.2 Hz flattens at R > 20 au, gradually approaching an f−1 spectrum, probably due to instrument noise. At 0.002 Hz < f < 0.1 Hz, quasi-parallel propagation dominates at 1 au < R < 7 au, with quasi-perpendicular propagation gradually emerging at R > 5 au. For R > 7 au, oblique propagation becomes the primary mode of propagation. At smaller frequencies of f < 0.01 Hz, increases with propagation angle at 1 au < R < 5 au, and in contrast decreases with propagation angle at R > 5 au due to the enhanced power level at propagation angles smaller than 20°. Such enhancement may derive from the injection of wave energy from the pickup ion source into the background turbulent cascade, and the injected wave energy is transferred across scales without leaving local enhancements in or .

<div> FeLoBALQs, spectral energy distributions, near-infrared variability, reddening, accretion rate<br />总结:
这篇文章研究了30个低红移的低离子化铁吸收发射线类星体（FeLoBALQs），并与LoBALQs和未吸收类星体进行了比较。研究发现未吸收比较样本中的光谱性质与促成率指标之间存在显著的相关性，而FeLoBAL类星体中由于一定范围的泛红可能抑制了这些相关性。还发现光学波段的红化与外流位置有关，表明外流与尘埃之间存在连接。WISE变化性分析显示变化幅度与推断的连续发射区域尺寸之间存在反相关关系，这解释了类星体中变化幅度与亮度之间的反相关关系。LoBALQ的光学发射线和其他参数更类似于未吸收连续谱样本对象，而FeLoBAL类星体则是一个特殊的对象群。根据促成率场景，解释了FeLoBAL类星体的结果，即高促成率的FeLoBAL类星体辐射强大到足以产生厚重、高速的外流，而中等促成率的类星体可能存在外流，但不足以包含Fe ii吸收，低促成率的FeLoBAL外流来自于一个失败的环状结构吸收，无法再将辐射转换成近红外光。 <div>
We present the optical–near-infrared spectral energy distributions (SED) and near-infrared variability properties of 30 low-redshift iron low-ionization Broad Absorption Line quasars (FeLoBALQs) and matched samples of LoBALQs and unabsorbed quasars. Significant correlations between the SED properties and accretion rate indicators found among the unabsorbed comparison sample objects suggest an intrinsic origin for SED differences. A range of reddening likely mutes these correlations among the FeLoBAL quasars. The rest-frame optical-band reddening is correlated with the location of the outflow, suggesting a link between the outflows and the presence of dust. We analyzed the WISE variability and provide a correction for photometry uncertainties in an appendix. We found an anticorrelation between the variability amplitude and inferred continuum emission region size, and we suggest that as the origin of the anticorrelation between variability amplitude and luminosity typically observed in quasars. We found that the LoBALQ Optical Emission-line and other parameters are more similar to those of the unabsorbed continuum sample objects than the FeLoBALQs. Thus, FeLoBAL quasars are a special population of objects. We interpret the results using an accretion-rate scenario for FeLoBAL quasars. The high-accretion-rate FeLoBAL quasars are radiating powerfully enough to drive a thick, high-velocity outflow. Quasars with intermediate accretion rates may have an outflow, but it is not sufficiently thick to include Fe ii absorption. Low-accretion-rate FeLoBAL outflows originate in absorption in a failing torus, no longer optically thick enough to reprocess radiation into the near-IR.

<div> 关键词: AB Dor, X射线观测, coronal imaging, 长期周期性, flip-flop cycle

总结:
AB Dor是一个超快自转的活跃恒星，X射线观测显示其存在频繁的耀斑事件，耀斑事件占据了观测时间的大部分。在没有耀斑的X射线光变曲线中，显示了旋转调制的特征，表明恒星的日冕中存在高度活跃的区域。通过日冕成像发现了两个不同亮度的活跃区域，并观察到它们在经度上的变化和亮度上的变化。长期X射线数据分析发现存在多个周期性，包括一个类似太阳的长期模式和可能与翻转循环相关的周期。需要进一步的长期观测来确认X射线翻转循环的存在。 <br /><br /> <div>
Using long-term X-ray observations, we present short-term and long-term X-ray variability analysis of the ultrafast rotating active star AB Dor. Flaring events are common in X-ray observations of AB Dor and occupy a substantial portion of the total observation time, averaging at around 57% ± 23%. The flare-free X-ray light curves show rotational modulation, indicating the presence of highly active regions in the star's corona. We have developed a light-curve inversion code to image the corona of active fast rotating stars. The results of coronal imaging reveal the presence of two active regions of different brightness that are separated by ∼180° in longitude. These active regions are also found to migrate along the longitude and also show variation in their brightness. Our analysis of long-term X-ray data spanning from 1979 to 2022 shows multiple periodicities. The existence of a ∼19.2 yr cycle and its first harmonic indicates the presence of a solar-like, long-term pattern. In comparison, the periodicities of ∼3.6 and ∼5.4 yr are possibly due to the presence of a flip-flop cycle in the X-rays, which is also supported by findings for similar periods from the optical data in earlier studies. Further confirmation of the existence of the X-ray flip-flop cycle requires long-term observations at regular intervals in the quiescent state.

<div> 关键词: CL-AGNs, Sloan Digital Sky Survey V, 超大质量黑洞, 光谱变化, Eddington比率<br />
总结: <br />这篇文章报告了关于"Changing-look" active galactic nuclei (CL-AGNs)的研究成果，通过对近29,000个已知活跃星系核的多次光谱观测和跟踪，发现了116个CL-AGN案例，并对其进行了分析。研究发现，CL事件在低Eddington比率系统中更常见，并且发现了广泛的Mg ii发射线变化较小的趋势。这个研究样本是迄今为止报道的最大的CL-AGN样本，对于研究极端AGN变化和物理学具有重要意义。 <br /> <div>
“Changing-look” active galactic nuclei (CL-AGNs) challenge our basic ideas about the physics of accretion flows and circumnuclear gas around supermassive black holes. Using first-year Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V) repeated spectroscopy of nearly 29,000 previously known active galactic nuclei (AGNs), combined with dedicated follow-up spectroscopy, and publicly available optical light curves, we have identified 116 CL-AGNs where (at least) one broad emission line has essentially (dis-)appeared, as well as 88 other extremely variable systems. Our CL-AGN sample, with 107 newly identified cases, is the largest reported to date, and includes ∼0.4% of the AGNs reobserved in first-year SDSS-V operations. Among our CL-AGNs, 67% exhibit dimming while 33% exhibit brightening. Our sample probes extreme AGN spectral variability on months to decades timescales, including some cases of recurring transitions on surprisingly short timescales (≲2 months in the rest frame). We find that CL events are preferentially found in lower-Eddington-ratio (fEdd) systems: Our CL-AGNs have a fEdd distribution that significantly differs from that of a carefully constructed, redshift- and luminosity-matched control sample (Anderson–Darling test yielding pAD ≈ 6 × 10−5; median fEdd ≈ 0.025 versus 0.043). This preference for low fEdd strengthens previous findings of higher CL-AGN incidence at lower fEdd, found in smaller samples. Finally, we show that the broad Mg ii emission line in our CL-AGN sample tends to vary significantly less than the broad Hβ emission line. Our large CL-AGN sample demonstrates the advantages and challenges in using multi-epoch spectroscopy from large surveys to study extreme AGN variability and physics.

<div> UHECR, dipole anisotropy, extragalactic magnetic field, number density, CosmicFlows-2<br />
总结: 该研究确认了超高能宇宙射线到达方向的偶极各向异性，并对小尺度各向异性进行了限制，进而制约了外星系磁场和UHECR源的数量密度。研究表明UHECR源的偏好分布与外星系物质的密度分布关系不大。通过对局部宇宙的密度分布进行处理，并考虑了宇宙射线在传播过程中的相互作用和能量损失以及银河磁场的影响，得到了良好的模拟结果。 <div>
A dipole anisotropy in ultra–high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) arrival directions, of extragalactic origin, is now firmly established at energies E > 8 EeV. Furthermore, the UHECR angular power spectrum shows no power at smaller angular scales than the dipole, apart from hints of possible individual hot or warm spots for energy thresholds ≳40 EeV. Here we exploit the magnitude of the dipole and the limits on smaller-scale anisotropies to place constraints on two quantities: the extragalactic magnetic field (EGMF) and the number density of UHECR sources or the volumetric event rate if UHECR sources are transient. We also vary the bias between the extragalactic matter and the UHECR source densities, reflecting whether UHECR sources are preferentially found in over- or underdense regions, and find that little or no bias is favored. We follow Ding et al. (2021) in using the CosmicFlows-2 density distribution of the local universe as our baseline distribution of UHECR sources, but we improve and extend that work by employing an accurate and self-consistent treatment of interactions and energy losses during propagation. Deflections in the Galactic magnetic field are treated using either the full JF12 magnetic field model, with both random and coherent components, or just the coherent part, to bracket the impact of the GMF on the dipole anisotropy. This large-scale structure model gives good agreement with both the direction and magnitude of the measured dipole anisotropy and forms the basis for simulations of discrete sources and the inclusion of EGMF effects.

总结: 该研究分析了N2H+、HCO+、HCN和C18O等分子在20个原行星盘中的排放情况，并发现了这些分子通量与盘尘质量和半径之间存在着正相关关系。此外，不同分子种类的通量之间也存在着较强的正相关性。然而，一些盘可能在这些分子通量上表现出明显的差异，甚至在同一星际成形区域内也有所不同。这表明了类似年龄和形成环境的系统可能拥有不同范围内的盘质量和化学成分。未来需要更全面和统一的样本来寻找与形成环境或年龄相关的趋势。 <br /><br />  
总结: <div>
Molecular emission is used to investigate both the physical and chemical properties of protoplanetary disks. Therefore, to derive disk properties accurately, we need a thorough understanding of the behavior of the molecular probes upon which we rely. Here we investigate how the molecular line emission of N2H+, HCO+, HCN, and C18O compare to other measured quantities in a set of 20 protoplanetary disks. Overall, we find positive correlations between multiple line fluxes and the disk dust mass and radius. We also generally find strong positive correlations between the line fluxes of different molecular species. However, some disks do show noticeable differences in the relative fluxes of N2H+, HCO+, HCN, and C18O. These differences occur even within a single star-forming region. This results in a potentially large range of different disk masses and chemical compositions for systems of similar age and birth environment. While we make preliminary comparisons of molecular fluxes across different star-forming regions, more complete and uniform samples are needed in the future to search for trends with birth environment or age.

TV Col是一个长周期的淡变型中间极光星，研究了TESS光度测量数据。发现NSH振幅和日食深度都有周期性变化，NSH振幅的周期与日食极小的周期非常接近，这进一步证实了NSH的形成与倾斜盘进动有关。同时发现日食深度存在双周期性变化，可能与倾斜盘的进动有关。这一发现为研究中间极光星和倾斜盘的进动提供了新的视角。 
<br />总结: TV Col是一个长周期的淡变型中间极光星，NSH振幅和日食深度都有周期性变化，与倾斜盘进动有关。同时发现日食深度存在双周期性变化，可能与倾斜盘的进动有关。 <div>
TV Col is a long-period eclipsing intermediate polar (IP) prototype star for the negative superhump (NSH) system. We investigate the eclipse minima, eclipse depth, and NSH amplitude based on TESS photometry. Using the same analytical method as for SDSS J081256.85+191157.8, we find periodic variations of O − C for eclipse minima and NSH amplitudes with periods of 3.939(25) days and 3.907(30) days, respectively. The periodic variation of the NSH amplitude of TV Col confirms that periodic changes in NSH amplitude in response to the tilted disk precession may be universal, which is further evidence that the origin of the NSHs is related to the tilted disk precession. We suggest that the variation in NSH amplitude may be similar to the superorbital signal, coming from the periodic change in visual brightness of the energy released by streams touching the tilted disk with tilted disk precession. Finally, we find for the first time that the eclipse depth exhibits biperiodic variations with periods of P1 = 3.905(11) days and P2 = 1.953(4) days, respectively. P2 is about half of P1 and the disk precession period (P1 ≈ Pprec ≈ 2 × P2). We suggest that P1 may come from the periodic change in the brightness of the eclipse center due to tilted disk precession, while P2 may come from two accretion curtains precessing together with the tilted disk, but more verification and discussion are necessary. The discovery of biperiodic variations in eclipse depth provides a new window for studying IPs and tilted disk precession.

We investigate the formation of an ideal magnetized jet that originates from a disk acting as a boundary by conducting axisymmetric MHD simulations. Our simulations demonstrate that the magnetized jet is consistently launched and reaches a stable state. To further advance our study, we extended the model setup to three dimensions and performed 3D MHD simulations of the jet launched from a disk surface, achieving a stable and appropriate model setup. Additionally, we expanded our study by incorporating the companion star and examining the influence of the Roche potential on the jet material. Specifically, we investigate whether including the companion star in the model significantly affects the dynamical evolution of the jet. Our findings reveal the formation of an arc-like structure in the density map of the jet cross section, which is attributed to the direct tidal effects. This implies that while the primary physical effects and characteristics of the outflow on a larger scale are attributed to the host accretion disk, the direct tidal effects on the jet dynamics have a substantial impact, particularly in the vicinity of the Roche lobe and toward the secondary star.

总结：<br /><br />本研究通过对稀疏化区域进行超级对应时段分析，观察了质子和α粒子参数的渐进演化。稀疏化区域内并没有找到明显的快慢太阳风的边界，大多数观测表明大部分的稀疏化区域等离子体对应于快速太阳风；只有α-质子漂移速度从稀疏化区域开始有所减小。我们研究了它在星际空间内减小的不同方式，并表明这一特征很可能与多组分太阳风的镜像有关。然而，考虑到观测到的太阳风特性和质子参数之间的相互关系，我们定义了在α相对丰度和α-质子温度比急剧变化为典型快速太阳风向慢速太阳风值的组成边界。这一边界是可能的太阳风界面的最有可能的候选者。基于这些发现，我们推测稀疏化区域的形成已经在太阳附近开始，并提出了两种可能的情景。 <div>
A rarefaction region (RR) occurs at the trailing edge of the fast solar wind stream. It comes from an area of small longitudinal extent on the solar surface and exhibits a fine and complex structure. In our study, we did a superposed epoch analysis of the proton and α parameters across the RR and observed their gradual evolution. We did not find any clear boundary between the fast and slow solar winds inside the RR because a majority of our observations show that most of the RR plasma corresponds to the fast solar wind; only the α–proton drift velocity decreases from the beginning of the RR. We investigate different ways of its reduction in interplanetary space and show that this feature is likely associated with the mirroring of the multicomponent solar wind. Nevertheless, considering the observed solar wind characteristics and taking into account the mutual relations between the proton and α parameters, we define the composition boundary where the α relative abundance and α–proton temperature ratio change abruptly from the values typical for the fast wind toward slow wind values. This boundary is the most probable candidate for the stream interface. Based on these findings, we speculate that the RR formation starts already near the Sun and formulate two possible scenarios.

The cycling of metals between interstellar gas and dust is a critical aspect of the baryon cycle of galaxies, yet our understanding of this process is limited. This study focuses on understanding dust depletion effects in the low-metallicity regime (<20% Z⊙) typical of cosmic noon. Using medium-resolution UV spectroscopy from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope, gas-phase abundances and depletions of iron and sulfur were derived toward 18 sight lines in local dwarf galaxies IC 1613 and Sextans A. The results show that the depletion of Fe and S is consistent with that found in the Milky Way (MW), LMC, and SMC. The depletion level of Fe increases with gas column density, indicating dust growth in the interstellar medium. The level of Fe depletion decreases with decreasing metallicity, resulting in the fraction of iron in gas ranging from 3% in the MW to 9% in IC 1613 and ∼19% in Sextans A. The dust-to-gas and dust-to-metal ratios (D/G, D/M) for these dwarf galaxies were estimated based on the MW relations between the depletion of Fe and other elements. The study finds that D/G decreases only slightly sublinearly with metallicity, with D/M decreasing from 0.41 ± 0.05 in the MW to 0.11 ± 0.11 at 0.10 Z⊙ (at log N(H) = 21 cm−2). The trend of D/G versus metallicity using depletion in local systems is similar to that inferred in Damped Lyα systems from abundance ratios but lies higher than the trend inferred from far-IR measurements in nearby galaxies.

Gravitational-wave (GW) observations from neutron stars (NSs) in a binary system provide an excellent scenario to constrain the nuclear parameters. The investigation of Pratten et al. has shown that the ignorance of f-mode dynamical tidal correction in the GW waveform model of the binary NS system can lead to substantial bias in the measurement of NS properties and NS equations of state. In this work, we investigate the bias in the nuclear parameters resulting from the ignorance of dynamical tidal correction. In addition, this work demonstrates the sensitivity of the nuclear parameters and the estimated constraints on nuclear parameters and NS properties from future GW observations. We infer the nuclear parameters from GW observations by describing the NS matter within the relativistic mean field model. For a population of GW events, we notice that the ignorance of dynamical tide predicts a lower median for nucleon effective mass (m*) by ∼6% compared to the scenario when dynamical tidal correction is considered. Whereas, at a 90% credible interval, m* gets constrained up to ∼5% and ∼3% in A+ (the LIGO-Virgo detectors with a sensitivity of the fifth observing run) and Cosmic Explorer, respectively. We also discuss the resulting constraints on all other nuclear parameters, including compressibility, symmetry energy, and slope of symmetry energy, considering an ensemble of GW events. We do not notice any significant impact in analyzing nuclear parameters other than m* due to the ignorance of f-mode dynamical tides.

The solar minima between solar cycles 22–23, 23–24, and 24–25 are the best observed minima on record. In situ solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field measurements by the Wind and ACE spacecraft at L1 with 1 hr cadence are explored using wavelet analyses for the most quiescent year during each minimum. Times of local peaks in periodicities are identified in the solar wind velocity, magnetic field components, and proton number densities. The measured radial velocities at these times are used to trace magnetic field lines to the photosphere using two models. The first is the Fisk heliospheric magnetic field that traces field lines from L1 to the photosphere. They connect exclusively to solar poles and in 88% of instances to locations of polar coronal holes (PCHs). The second model uses the Parker spiral to trace from L1 to the solar source surface and potential-field extrapolations from the source surface to the photosphere. These field lines terminate at equatorial and midlatitude coordinates, of which some are located close to coronal holes (CHs). This study connects for the first time CH signatures in the ecliptic plane at L1 with PCHs using the Fisk field. It shows how sources from both the solar equator and poles influence the solar wind at L1 and how the two models complement each other to identify these sources.

<title>Limits on the OH Molecule in the Smith High-velocity Cloud</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have used the Green Bank Telescope to search for the OH molecule at several locations in the Smith Cloud, one of the most prominent of the high-velocity clouds surrounding the Milky Way. Five positions with high H i column density were selected as targets for individual pointings, along with a square degree around a molecular cloud detected with the Planck telescope near the tip of the Smith Cloud. Gas in the Galactic disk with similar values of NHI has detectable OH emission. Although we found OH at velocities consistent with the foreground Aquila molecular cloud, nothing was found at the velocity of the Smith Cloud to an rms level of 0.7 mK (Tb) in a 1 km s−1 channel. The three positions that give the strictest limits on OH are analyzed in detail. Their combined data imply a 5σ limit on N(H2)/NHI ≤ 0.03, scaled by a factor dependent on the OH excitation temperature and background continuum Tex/(Tex − Tbg). There is no evidence for far-infrared emission from dust within the Smith Cloud. These results are consistent with expectations for a low-metallicity diffuse cloud exposed to the radiation field of the Galactic halo, rather than a product of a galactic fountain.

Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observed sub-Alfvénic solar wind intervals during encounters 8–14, and low-frequency magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in these regions may differ from that in super-Alfvénic wind. We apply a new mode decomposition analysis to the sub-Alfvénic flow observed by PSP on 2021 April 28, identifying and characterizing entropy, magnetic islands, forward and backward Alfvén waves, including weakly/nonpropagating Alfvén vortices, forward and backward fast and slow magnetosonic (MS) modes. Density fluctuations are primarily and almost equally entropy- and backward-propagating slow MS modes. The mode decomposition provides phase information (frequency and wavenumber k) for each mode. Entropy density fluctuations have a wavenumber anisotropy of k∥ ≫ k⊥, whereas slow-mode density fluctuations have k⊥ > k∥. Magnetic field fluctuations are primarily magnetic island modes (δBi) with an O(1) smaller contribution from unidirectionally propagating Alfvén waves (δBA+) giving a variance anisotropy of . Incompressible magnetic fluctuations dominate compressible contributions from fast and slow MS modes. The magnetic island spectrum is Kolmogorov-like in perpendicular wavenumber, and the unidirectional Alfvén wave spectra are and . Fast MS modes propagate at essentially the Alfvén speed with anticorrelated transverse velocity and magnetic field fluctuations and are almost exclusively magnetic due to βp ≪ 1. Transverse velocity fluctuations are the dominant velocity component in fast MS modes, and longitudinal fluctuations dominate in slow modes. Mode decomposition is an effective tool in identifying the basic building blocks of MHD turbulence and provides detailed phase information about each of the modes.

<title>A Steep Decline in the Galaxy Space Density beyond Redshift 9 in the CANUCS UV Luminosity Function</title>

We present a new sample of 158 galaxies at redshift z > 7.5 selected from deep James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam imaging of five widely separated sight lines in the CANUCS survey. Two-thirds of the pointings and 80% of the galaxies are covered by 12–14 NIRCam filters, including seven to nine medium bands, providing accurate photometric redshifts and robustness against low-redshift interlopers. A sample of 28 galaxies at z > 7.5 with spectroscopic redshifts shows a low systematic offset and scatter in the difference between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts. We derive the galaxy UV luminosity function at redshifts 8–12, finding a slightly higher normalization than previously seen with the Hubble Space Telescope at redshifts 8–10. We observe a steeper decline in the galaxy space density from z = 8 to 12 than found by most JWST Cycle 1 studies. In particular, we find only eight galaxies at z > 10 and none at z > 12.5, with no z > 10 galaxies brighter than F277W AB = 28 or MUV = −20 in our unmasked, delensed survey area of 53.4 arcmin2. We attribute the lack of bright z > 10 galaxies in CANUCS compared to GLASS and CEERS to intrinsic variance in the galaxy density along different sight lines. The evolution in the CANUCS luminosity function between z = 8 and 12 is comparable to that predicted by simulations that assume a standard star formation efficiency without invoking any special adjustments.

<title>Halo Asymmetry in the Modeling of Galaxy Clustering</title>

Conventional studies of galaxy clustering within the framework of halo models typically assume that the density profile of all dark matter halos can be approximated by the Navarro–Frenk–White (NFW) spherically symmetric profile. However, both modern N-body simulations and observational data suggest that most halos are either oblate or prolate, and almost never spherical. In this paper we present a modified model of the galaxy correlation function. In addition to the five “classical” halo occupation distribution (HOD) parameters proposed by Zheng et al., it includes an additional free parameter ϕ in the modified NFW density profile describing the asymmetry of the host dark matter halo. Using a subhalo abundance matching model, we populate galaxies within BolshoiP N-body simulations. We compute the projected two-point correlation function wp(rp) for six stellar-mass volume-limited galaxy samples. We fit our model to the results and then compare the best-fit asymmetry parameter ϕ (and other halo parameters) to the asymmetry of dark matter halos measured directly from the simulations and find that they agree within 1σ. We then fit our model to the wp(rp) results from Zehavi et al. and compare halo parameters. We show that our model accurately retrieves the halo asymmetry and other halo parameters. Additionally, we find 2%–6% differences between the halo masses ( and logM1) estimated by our model and those estimated by “classical” HOD models. The model proposed in this paper can serve as an alternative to multiparameter HOD models, since it can be used for relatively small samples of galaxies.

<title>Turbulence, and Proton and Electron Heating Rates in the Solar Corona: Analytical Approach</title>

Analytical solutions for 2D and slab turbulence energies in the solar corona are presented, including a derivation of the corresponding correlation lengths, with implications for the proton and electron temperatures in the solar corona. These solutions are derived by solving the transport equations for 2D and slab turbulence energies and their correlation lengths, as well as proton and electron pressures. The solutions assume background profiles for the solar wind speed, solar wind mass density, and Alfvén velocity. Our analytical solutions can be related to those obtained from joint Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter Metis coronagraph observations, as reported in Telloni et al. We find that the solution for 2D turbulence energy in the absence of nonlinear dissipation decreases more slowly compared to the dissipative solution. The solution for slab turbulence energy with no dissipation exhibits a more rapid increase compared to the dissipative solution. The proton heating rate is found to be about 82% of the total plasma heating rate at 6.3 R⊙, which gradually decreases with increasing distance, eventually becoming ∼80% of the total plasma heating rate at ∼13 R⊙, consistent with that found by Bandyopadhyay et al. (2023). These analytical solutions provide valuable insight for our understanding of turbulence, and its effect on proton and electron heating rates, in the solar corona. We compare the numerically solved turbulent transport equations for the 2D and slab turbulence energies, correlation lengths, and proton and electron pressures with the analytical solutions, finding good agreement between them.

发现并表征了TIC 350842552 (“Zvrk”)，这是一颗明显孤立的快速自转的红巨星，其自转周期约为99天。这一发现利用TESS在南方连续观测区进行观测。通过p模式星震学、TESS和ASAS-SN光度观测以及光谱旋转展宽的测量，独立验证了该星的快速表面自转。APOGEE光谱的双成分拟合指示了与光度旋转信号幅度一致的表面特征覆盖分数。随时间变化的光度调制幅度变化表明其表面形貌的演变，因此显示出增强的磁活动。研究人员进一步开发并应用新的星震技术来表征径向差异自转，但最多只发现了对Zvrk的对流包层内旋转剪切的微弱证据。这种高表面自转速率与单星演化中的角动量传输模型不一致。光谱丰度估计还表明高锂丰度，以及其他化学异常。所有这些迹象都暗示了Zvrk构型形成的行星吞食场景，研究人员详细考察了各种模型。 <br /><br />总结: TIC 350842552 (“Zvrk”)是一颗快速自转的红巨星，其表面形貌的演变暗示了增强的磁活动，而与单星演化模型不一致的高自转速率，以及化学异常都暗示了可能是通过行星吞食的方式形成的。 <div>
We report the discovery and characterization of TIC 350842552 (“Zvrk”), an apparently isolated, rapidly rotating (Prot ∼ 99 days) red giant observed by TESS in its southern Continuous Viewing Zone. The star’s fast surface rotation is independently verified by the use of p-mode asteroseismology, strong periodicity in TESS and ASAS-SN photometry, and measurements of spectroscopic rotational broadening. A two-component fit to APOGEE spectra indicates a coverage fraction of its surface features consistent with the amplitude of the photometric rotational signal. Variations in the amplitude of its photometric modulations over time suggest the evolution of its surface morphology and therefore enhanced magnetic activity. We further develop and deploy new asteroseismic techniques to characterize radial differential rotation, but find at best only weak evidence for rotational shear within Zvrk’s convective envelope. This high surface rotation rate is incompatible with models of angular-momentum transport in single-star evolution. Spectroscopic abundance estimates also indicate a high lithium abundance, among other chemical anomalies. Taken together, all of these suggest a planet-ingestion scenario for the formation of this rotational configuration, various models for which we examine in detail.

<div> Class 0 binary protostellar system, R CrA IRAS 32, Early Planet Formation, ALMA, circumstellar disks, circumbinary structure<br />Young protostellar binary system R CrA IRAS 32 has been characterized using ALMA, revealing circumstellar and circumbinary disk structures with aligned position angles and inclinations. The circumstellar disks show near/far-side asymmetry in continuum emission, indicating dust settling processes. CO isotopologue spectral analysis reveals outflows from both sources and likely from the circumbinary structure. Additionally, Keplerian rotation is detected in the 13CO isotopologues toward both circumstellar disks and the circumbinary structure, suggesting the latter is a circumbinary disk.<br /><br />总结: 年轻的原恒星双星系统R CrA IRAS 32经ALMA观测表征，显示出排列角度和倾角对齐的周恒星盘和周双星盘结构。周恒星盘显示出近/远侧不对称的连续辐射，表明尘埃沉降过程。 CO同位素谱分析显示来自两个源以及可能来自周双星结构的流出。此外，在13CO同位素谱中检测到朝向两个周恒星盘和周双星结构的开普勒旋转，表明后者可能是周双星盘。 <div>
Young protostellar binary systems, with expected ages less than ∼105 yr, are little modified since birth, providing key clues to binary formation and evolution. We present a first look at the young, Class 0 binary protostellar system R CrA IRAS 32 from the Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks ALMA large program, which observed the system in the 1.3 mm continuum emission, 12CO (2−1), 13CO (2−1), C18O (2−1), SO (65−54), and nine other molecular lines that trace disks, envelopes, shocks, and outflows. With a continuum resolution of ∼0.″03 (∼5 au, at a distance of 150 pc), we characterize the newly discovered binary system with a separation of 207 au, their circumstellar disks, and a circumbinary disklike structure. The circumstellar disk radii are 26.9 ± 0.3 and 22.8 ± 0.3 au for sources A and B, respectively, and their circumstellar disk dust masses are estimated as 22.5 ± 1.1 M⊕ and 12.4 ± 0.6 M⊕, respectively. The circumstellar disks and the circumbinary structure have well-aligned position angles and inclinations, indicating formation in a smooth, ordered process such as disk fragmentation. In addition, the circumstellar disks have a near/far-side asymmetry in the continuum emission, suggesting that the dust has yet to settle into a thin layer near the midplane. Spectral analysis of CO isotopologues reveals outflows that originate from both of the sources and possibly from the circumbinary disklike structure. Furthermore, we detect Keplerian rotation in the 13CO isotopologues toward both circumstellar disks and likely Keplerian rotation in the circumbinary structure; the latter suggests that it is probably a circumbinary disk.

<div> ULIRGs, SED modeling, CIGALE, starburst galaxies, radio spectra
<br />总结:
本研究利用CIGALE和UltraNest对14个本地超亮红外星系（ULIRG）的光谱能量分布进行了建模分析，同时讨论了25个星暴星系的全球天体物理性质。研究发现，总和非热的1.4和4.8 GHz射电辐射可以很好地估计最近的SFR，而4.8 GHz的热射电辐射是最近星形成的更好的迹象。此外，热射电辐射的4.8 GHz比1.4 GHz对最近的星形成更敏感。文章还指出，建模的非热射电谱指数与红移、恒星质量、SFR、特定SFR和尘埃质量之间没有明显相关性。 <div>
We present detailed spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling of 14 local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) with outstanding photometric data from the literature covering the ultraviolet–infrared (FIR) and radio bands (∼50 MHz to ∼30 GHz). We employ the CIGALE SED fitting code to model the ultraviolet–FIR–radio SED. For the radio-only SED modeling, we use the UltraNest package, leveraging its nested sampling algorithm. Combining the results from our previous study on 11 luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs), we discuss the global astrophysical properties of a sample of 25 starburst galaxies (z < 0.5). Their radio spectra are frequently characterized by bends and turnovers, with no indication of ULIRGs exhibiting more complicated SEDs than LIRGs despite showing more signs of interactions. Including radio measurements in the CIGALE modeling constrained the dust luminosity and star formation rate (SFR) estimates by more than 1 order of magnitude better than previously reported for starburst galaxies. We show that total and nonthermal radio luminosity at 1.4 and 4.8 GHz frequencies can be good estimators of recent SFRs for all LIRGs and those ULIRGS with an insignificant influence of active galactic nuclei. A weaker but still significant correlation is observed between radio SFRs at 1.4 GHz and old (averaged over 100 Myr) SFRs based on SED modeling, indicative of multiple episodes of starburst activity during their lifetime. The thermal radio luminosity at 4.8 GHz is a better tracer of recent star formation than the thermal luminosity at 1.4 GHz. Statistically, our modeled nonthermal radio spectral indices do not significantly correlate with redshift, stellar mass, SFR, specific SFR, and dust mass.

<div> 高角分辨率成像，ALMA，原行星盘，M型星，Taurus<br /> 
总结:<br />
研究利用ALMA对Taurus中6颗M型星的盘进行了高分辨率观测，发现了盘的普遍性和多样性。所有六个盘中均探测到尘埃连续辐射，五个盘中探测到12CO，两个盘中探测到13CO。气尘盘尺寸比率范围从1.6到5.1不等。四个盘显示环和空洞，两个盘表面光滑。我们进行了辐射传递拟合，发现微米尺寸尘埃颗粒的空洞可能比毫米尺寸尘埃颗粒的空洞更小。目前，Taurus中的M型星盘显示出比早期星更高的空洞检测频率，尽管我们需要一个更完整的样本来评估子结构与恒星质量的依赖关系。 <div>
High angular resolution imaging by Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has revealed the near universality and diversity of substructures in protoplanetary disks. However, disks around M-type pre-main-sequence stars are still poorly sampled, despite the prevalence of M dwarfs in the Galaxy. Here we present high-resolution (∼50 mas, 8 au) ALMA Band 6 observations of six disks around mid-M stars in Taurus. We detect dust continuum emission in all six disks, 12CO in five disks, and 13CO line in two disks. The size ratios between gas and dust disks range from 1.6 to 5.1. The ratio of about 5 for 2M0436 and 2M0450 indicates efficient dust radial drift. Four disks show rings and cavities, and two disks are smooth. The cavity sizes occupy a wide range: 60 au for 2M0412, and ∼10 au for 2M0434, 2M0436, and 2M0508. Detailed visibility modeling indicates that small cavities of 1.7 and 5.7 au may hide in the two smooth disks 2M0450 and CIDA 12. We perform radiative transfer fitting of the infrared spectral energy distributions to constrain the cavity sizes, finding that micron-sized dust grains may have smaller cavities than millimeter grains. Planet–disk interactions are the preferred explanation to produce the large 60 au cavity, while other physics could be responsible for the three ∼10 au cavities under current observations and theories. Currently, disks around mid- to late M stars in Taurus show a higher detection frequency of cavities than earlier-type stars, although a more complete sample is needed to evaluate any dependence of substructure on stellar mass.

这篇论文对巴纳德星进行了详细的光谱分析，比较了加拿大-法国-夏威夷望远镜/SPIRou拍摄的高质量近红外光谱和PHOENIX-ACES恒星大气模型。作者发现观测光谱中有成千上万条模型中未识别的光谱线，同时也有大量观测数据中未出现在模型中的光谱线。文章讨论了连续体不匹配、未解决的污染和光谱线偏离预期波长的问题，并提出了新的方法用于确定恒星的有效温度和金属丰度。最终得出了巴纳德星的有效温度和15种元素的丰度，强调了需要改进当前的大气模型以充分利用近红外光谱进行化学光谱分析。 <div>
Determination of fundamental parameters of stars impacts all fields of astrophysics, from galaxy evolution to constraining the internal structure of exoplanets. This paper presents a detailed spectroscopic analysis of Barnard’s star (otherwise known as Gl 699) that compares an exceptionally high-quality (an average signal-to-noise ratio of ∼1000 in the entire domain), high-resolution near-infrared (NIR) spectrum taken with Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope/SPIRou to PHOENIX-ACES stellar atmosphere models. The observed spectrum shows thousands of lines not identified in the models with a similarly large number of lines present in the model but not in the observed data. We also identify several other caveats, such as continuum mismatch, unresolved contamination, and spectral lines significantly shifted from their expected wavelengths; all of these can be a source of bias for the determination of abundance. Out of >104 observed lines in the NIR that could be used for chemical spectroscopy, we identify a short list of a few hundred lines that are reliable. We present a novel method for determining the effective temperature (Teff) and overall metallicity of slowly rotating M dwarfs that uses several groups of lines as opposed to bulk spectral fitting methods. With this method, we infer Teff = 3231 ± 21 K for Barnard's star, consistent with the value of 3238 ± 11 K inferred from the interferometric method. We also provide measurements of the abundance of 15 different elements for Barnard's star, including the abundances of four elements (K, O, Y, Th) never reported before for this star. This work emphasizes the need to improve current atmosphere models to fully exploit the NIR domain for chemical spectroscopy analysis.

2017–2022年间，我们对M31N 2008-12a经常性新星的喷发进行了光学、紫外和软X射线观测。我们在峰值附近的V和R波段光变曲线中发现了一个尖峰特征，可能与喷流有关。根据Hα发射线的形态动力学建模，我们推断新星喷发物质具有延展的双极喷流结构。光谱建模表明，每次喷发的喷射物质质量为10^-7–10^-8M⊙，并且含有增强的氦丰度。超软X射线源阶段显示出显著的变化，与紫外辐射呈反相关，表明二者可能有共同的起源。这种变化可能是由于吸积盘的重新形成。根据喷发间的复发周期，我们推断吸积速率稳步减少。将吸积速率与不同模型进行比较后，得出M31N 2008-12a的CO白矮星质量大于1.36M⊙，并随时间增长，使其成为Ia型超新星前体的单重变星场景的强有力候选者。<br /><br />总结:本研究对M31N 2008-12a的喷发进行了多波段观测，并发现了喷流相关的特征。根据Hα发射线的形态动力学建模，推断出了新星喷发物质的双极喷流结构。光谱建模显示出喷发物质的质量和氦丰度的增强。此外，超软X射线源阶段表现出显著的变化，并与紫外辐射呈现反相关关系，推测这种变化可能是由于吸积盘的重新形成。研究还推断出吸积速率稳步减少，并得出M31N 2008-12a的CO白矮星质量大于1.36M⊙，这使其成为Ia型超新星前体的单重变星场景的强有力候选者。 <div>
We report the optical, UV, and soft X-ray observations of the 2017–2022 eruptions of the recurrent nova M31N 2008-12a. We find a cusp feature in the - and -band light curves close to the peak, which could be related to jets. The geometry of the nova ejecta based on morpho-kinematic modeling of the Hα emission line indicates an extended jet-like bipolar structure. Spectral modeling indicates an ejecta mass of 10−7–10−8M⊙ during each eruption and an enhanced helium abundance. The supersoft source phase shows significant variability, which is anticorrelated to the UV emission, indicating a common origin. The variability could be due to the reformation of the accretion disk. We infer a steady decrease in the accretion rate over the years based on the intereruption recurrence period. A comparison of the accretion rate with different models on the plane yields the mass of a CO white dwarf, powering the H-shell flashes every ∼1 yr, to be >1.36 M⊙ and growing with time, making M31N 2008-12a a strong candidate for the single degenerate scenario of the Type Ia supernovae progenitor.

The structure of magnetic fields in galaxies remains poorly constrained, despite the importance of magnetism in the evolution of galaxies. Radio synchrotron and far-infrared (FIR) polarization and polarimetric observations are the best methods to measure galactic scale properties of magnetic fields in galaxies beyond the Milky Way. We use synthetic polarimetric observations of a simulated galaxy to identify and quantify the regions, scales, and interstellar medium (ISM) phases probed at FIR and radio wavelengths. Our studied suite of magnetohydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations features high-resolutions (10 pc full-cell size) and multiple magnetization models. Our synthetic observations have a striking resemblance to those of observed galaxies. We find that the total and polarized radio emission extends to approximately double the altitude above the galactic disk (half-intensity disk thickness of hI radio ∼ hPI radio = 0.23 ± 0.03 kpc) relative to the total FIR and polarized emission that are concentrated in the disk midplane (hI FIR ∼ hPI FIR = 0.11 ± 0.01 kpc). Radio emission traces magnetic fields at scales of ≳300 pc, whereas FIR emission probes magnetic fields at the smallest scales of our simulations. These scales are comparable to our spatial resolution and well below the spatial resolution (<300 pc) of existing FIR polarimetric measurements. Finally, we confirm that synchrotron emission traces a combination of the warm neutral and cold neutral gas phases, whereas FIR emission follows the densest gas in the cold neutral phase in the simulation. These results are independent of the ISM magnetic field strength. The complementarity we measure between radio and FIR wavelengths motivates future multiwavelength polarimetric observations to advance our knowledge of extragalactic magnetism.

<div> 电子、太阳风、离散散射、Fokker–Planck方程、磁场聚焦
总结:
本研究探讨了离散散射机制对太阳风中超热电子群的影响，使用Fokker–Planck方程模拟了电子偏转角分布的径向演化过程，并与Solar Orbiter和Parker Solar Probe任务获取的数据进行了比较。研究发现，在模型中通过调整湍流平均自由程，可以与观测数据得到显著一致的稳态解。得到的平均自由程约为天文单位数量级，且在100 eV–1 keV能量范围内显示出较弱的依赖性。这与库仑碰撞估计值明显不同，但与低刚度太阳高能粒子事件观测的平均自由程相吻合。研究结果表明在整个日球层距离范围内都存在电子的湍流散射，由此得出了一些重要结论，包括在距离太阳较远的地方存在低库仑数区域，这为在所有距离上存在各向同性的“光晕”成分提供了自然解释——电子在这个遥远的区域内成为各向同性后再进入日球层内部。 <div>
This study explores the impact of a turbulent scattering mechanism, akin to those influencing solar and galactic cosmic rays propagating in the interplanetary medium, on the population of suprathermal electrons in the solar wind. We employ a Fokker–Planck equation to model the radial evolution of electron pitch angle distributions under the action of magnetic focusing, which moves the electrons away from isotropy, and of a diffusion process that tends to bring them back to it. We compare the steady-state solutions of this Fokker–Planck equation with data obtained from the Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe missions and find a remarkable agreement, varying the turbulent mean free path as the sole free parameter in our model. The obtained mean free paths are of the order of the astronomical unit, and display weak dependence on electron energy within the 100 eV–1 keV range. This value is notably lower than Coulomb collision estimates but aligns well with observed mean free paths of low-rigidity solar energetic particle events. The strong agreement between our model and observations leads us to conclude that the hypothesis of turbulent scattering at work on electrons at all heliospheric distances is justified. We discuss several implications, notably the existence of a low Knudsen number region at large distances from the Sun, which offers a natural explanation for the presence of an isotropic “halo” component at all distances from the Sun—electrons being isotropized in this distant region before traveling back into the inner part of the interplanetary medium.

总结: <br /><br />这篇文章讨论了日冕物质抛射（CME）的早期演化及其启动机制。研究人员通过热磁流体力学模拟发现，CME的启动包含多个物理机制，并且这些机制密切相互联系。首先是由双曲线磁通管重联所引发并推动的缓慢上升。随后，缓慢上升由于双曲线磁通管重联和环不稳定性的早期发展共同推动而持续进行。最后，快速磁重联的开始和环不稳定性的发展引起了CME的即时加速。这些结果揭示了CME启动是一个复杂的过程，牵涉到多种物理机制，因此无法仅通过单一的启动机制加以解决。 <div>
Understanding the early evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), in particular their initiation, is the key to forecasting solar eruptions and induced disastrous space weather. Although many initiation mechanisms have been proposed, a full understanding of CME initiation, which is identified as a slow rise of CME progenitors in kinematics before impulsive acceleration, remains elusive. Here, with a state-of-the-art thermal magnetohydrodynamics simulation, we determine a complete CME initiation route in which multiple mainstream mechanisms occur in sequence yet are tightly coupled. The slow rise is first triggered and driven by the developing hyperbolic flux tube (HFT) reconnection. Subsequently, the slow rise continues as driven by the coupling of the HFT reconnection and the early development of torus instability. The end of the slow rise, i.e., the onset of the impulsive acceleration, is induced by the start of the fast magnetic reconnection coupled with the torus instability. These results unveil that CME initiation is a complicated process involving multiple physical mechanisms, thus being hardly resolved by a single initiation mechanism.

在最近的观测中发现，即使是温度较低、中性大气的质量极低的恒星和棕矮星也能够维持强大的磁场。这些磁场的强度可达千高斯，这是基于强烈的、高循环偏振的太赫兹无线电发射推断出来的，这是电子回旋加倍不稳定性的后果。这些观测暗示存在与强电流系统相关的高能非热电子群，就像太阳系中受磁场影响的行星的极光区域一样。这些强烈的极光电子降积将导致电子与H2气体碰撞，从而产生离子。受此启发，我们瞄准了一组已知表现出极光特征的超冷矮星，使用Maunakea的Keck望远镜搜索K波段发射特征。从我们的九个目标中，我们在低到中分辨率光谱（R约3600）中没有发现明显的发射特征。我们还对棕矮星大气中极光电子束的影响进行了建模，确定了产生的在何深度沉积能量并驱动粒子碰撞电离。我们发现，典型能量≳2-10千电子伏特的电子束可以解释观测中的未检测到的情况，因为它们会深入大气中，任何产生的离子在通过其红外跃迁辐射能量之前都会被化学破坏。强电子束进一步解释了UV极光探测的缺失，并暗示大部分或几乎所有降积极光能量最终必须以热辐射形式从棕矮星深处大气中释放。<br /><br />总结: 最近的观测表明，即使是质量极低的恒星和棕矮星也能维持强磁场。这些磁场可能与极端非热电子群和极光相关。然而，在对一组超冷矮星进行的观测中，并没有发现相关的发射特征。模拟结果显示，电子束在大气中深处沉积能量，并进行粒子碰撞电离。未检测到的发射特征有可能是由于电子束产生的离子在通过红外跃迁辐射能量之前就被化学破坏了。强电子束进一步解释了UV极光探测的缺失，并暗示大部分或几乎所有极光能量最终以热辐射形式从大气中释放。 <div>
Recent observations have demonstrated that very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs are capable of sustaining strong magnetic fields despite their cool and neutral atmospheres. These kilogauss field strengths are inferred based on strong, highly circularly polarized gigahertz radio emission, a consequence of the electron cyclotron maser instability. Crucially, these observations imply the existence of energetic nonthermal electron populations, associated with strong current systems, as are found in the auroral regions of the magnetized planets of the solar system. Intense auroral electron precipitation will lead to electron collisions with the H2 gas that should generate the ion . With this motivation, we targeted a sample of ultracool dwarfs, known to exhibit signatures associated with aurorae, in search of the K-band emission features of using the Keck telescopes on Maunakea. From our sample of nine objects, we found no clear indication of emission features in our low-to-medium-resolution spectra (R ∼ 3600). We also modeled the impact of an auroral electron beam on a brown dwarf atmosphere, determining the depth at which energetic beams deposit their energy and drive particle impact ionization. We find that the nondetections can be explained by electron beams of typical energies ≳2–10 keV, which penetrate deeply enough that any produced is chemically destroyed before radiating energy through its infrared transitions. Strong electron beams could further explain the lack of UV auroral detections and suggest that most or nearly all of the precipitating auroral energy must ultimately emerge as thermal emissions deep in brown dwarf atmospheres.

总结:<br /><br />这项研究报告了对著名Seyfert-2型活动星系核（AGN）NGC 4388中窄Fe Kα线和反射谱的研究。利用两次NICER监测活动中的X射线光谱总和，分隔了数年，显示了直接连续谱和反射发射的显著变化，但遮挡气体的变化很小。对NICER观测得到的光谱的拟合发现，幂律光子指数Γ与直接流量之间存在强烈的正相关性，这在未遮挡的AGN中通常观察到。对直接和反射光谱之间的反响时滞的搜索显示，主要受窄Fe Kα发射线主导，测量出约为几天的时间尺度，或约为pc的特征半径。观察到了这种暂定滞后的一个循环，但这是由于直接连续谱的突然下降而导致的，随后窄Fe Kα线的显着消失。对NGC 4388的高分辨率Chandra光谱的物理拟合测量出一个线产生半径，与暂定滞后基本一致。线型特征还倾向于一个Compton厚反射体，表明其起源可能是在盘中和/或风中的厚团块内。我们讨论了分析的优缺点以及在未来观测中测试结果的方法，并指出X射线反响滞后可能用于约束不可见光学宽线区的被遮挡Seyferts中的黑洞质量。 <div>
We report on a study of the narrow Fe Kα line and reflection spectrum in the well-known Seyfert-2 active galactic nucleus (AGN), NGC 4388. X-ray spectra summed from two extensive NICER monitoring campaigns, separated by years, show strong evidence of variation in the direct continuum and reflected emission, but only small variations in the obscuring gas. Fits to the spectra from individual NICER observations find a strong, positive correlation between the power-law photon index, Γ, and direct flux that is commonly observed in unobscured AGN. A search for a reverberation lag between the direct and reflected spectra—dominated by the narrow Fe Kα emission line—measures a timescale of days, or a characteristic radius of pc . Only one cycle of this tentative lag is observed, but it is driven by a particularly sharp drop in the direct continuum that leads to the subsequent disappearance of the otherwise prominent Fe Kα line. Physically motivated fits to high-resolution Chandra spectra of NGC 4388 measure a line production radius of , formally consistent with the tentative lag. The line profile also prefers a Compton-thick reflector, indicating an origin in the disk and/or thick clumps within a wind. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of our analysis and methods for testing our results in future observations, and we note the potential for X-ray reverberation lags to constrain black hole masses in obscured Seyferts wherein the optical broad line region is not visible.

Recent measurements of carbon isotope ratios in both protoplanetary disks and exoplanet atmospheres have suggested a possible transfer of significant carbon isotope fractionation from disks to planets. For a clearer understanding of the isotopic link between disks and planets, it is important to measure the carbon isotope ratios in various species. In this paper, we present a detection of the 13CN N = 2 − 1 hyperfine lines in the TW Hya disk with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. This is the first spatially resolved detection of 13CN in disks, which enables us to measure the spatially resolved 12CN/13CN ratio for the first time. We conducted nonlocal thermal equilibrium modeling of the 13CN lines in conjunction with previously observed 12CN lines to derive the kinetic temperature, H2 volume density, and column densities of 12CN and 13CN. The H2 volume density is found to range between (4 − 10) × 107 cm−3, suggesting that CN molecules mainly reside in the disk's upper layer. The 12CN/13CN ratio is measured to be at 30 < r < 80 au from the central star, which is similar to the 12C/13C ratio in the interstellar medium. However, this value differs from the previously reported values found for other carbon-bearing molecules (CO and HCN) in the TW Hya disk. This could be self-consistently explained by different emission layer heights for different molecules combined with preferential sequestration of 12C into the solid phase toward the disk midplane. This study reveals the complexity of the carbon isotope fractionation operating in disks.

<div> 星体形成、分子云、ATLASGAL调查、紧凑配置、亚毫米阵列
总结:
星体形成区域的质量组装来源于分子云中的分层结构和不同尺度上的碎裂。本文使用亚毫米阵列的紧凑配置对ATLASGAL调查中选择的一系列不同演化状态的大质量团块的碎裂进行了研究。观测结果显示，在2″尺度或0.015-0.09 pc的物理尺度上，约60%的源显示出有限或无碎裂。还发现了几个例子，证明了亚毫米阵列检测到的核心与团块的潜在位置明显偏离，这表明初始碎裂并不会形成大量的朗格曼质量碎片。我们发现，团块中紧凑结构所占的质量分数随着源的演化而增加。还发现碎片的最大质量与母团块的辐射光度存在显著相关。这些发现表明，大质量星体形成通过团块供给的核心吸积进行，初始碎裂取决于团块的密度结构和/或磁场。 <div>
The mass assembly in star-forming regions arises from the hierarchical structure in molecular clouds in tandem with fragmentation at different scales. In this paper, we present a study of the fragmentation of massive clumps covering a range of evolutionary states, selected from the ATLASGAL survey, using the compact configuration of the Submillimeter Array. The observations reveal a wide diversity in the fragmentation properties with about 60% of the sources showing limited to no fragmentation at the 2″ scale, or a physical scale of 0.015–0.09 pc. We also find several examples where the cores detected with the Submillimeter Array are significantly offset from the clump potential, suggesting that initial fragmentation does not result in the formation of a large number of Jeans mass fragments. The fraction of the clump mass that is in compact structures is seen to increase with source evolution. We also see a significant correlation between the maximum mass of a fragment and the bolometric luminosity of the parent clump. These suggest that massive star formation proceeds through clump fed core accretion, with the initial fragmentation being dependent on the density structure of the clumps and/or magnetic fields.

总结: 
这项研究提出了一个解释ON 231不同变异现象的场景，其中喷流发射由闪耀和较不可变的组件组成，并且变异主要由激波引起，而非多普勒效应。他们对多波段光度曲线进行了相关性分析，并发现光学波段的ON 231出现了较明亮时较硬的趋势，偏振度和流量之间也有类似的关系。同时他们发现X射线发射由两个对数-抛物线函数描述的两个成分组成，可以量化地重现观察到的趋势转变。在伽玛射线波段，他们发现了对应的趋势，并认为这可以通过存在非常高能的伽马射线背景组件来解释。这项研究阐明了中间谱凝聚BL Lac天体的变异机制。 <div>
The variation mechanism of blazars is a long-standing unresolved problem. In this work, we present a scenario to explain diverse variation phenomena for ON 231, where the jet emissions are composed of the flaring and the less variable components (most probably from the post-flaring blobs), and the variation is dominated by shock-in-jet instead of the Doppler effect. We perform correlation analysis for the multiwavelength light curves and find no significant correlations. For the optical band, ON 231 exhibits a harder when brighter (HWB) trend, and the trend seems to shift at different periods. Correspondingly, the correlation between the degree of polarization and flux exhibits a V-shaped behavior, and a similar translation relation during different periods is also found. These phenomena could be understood via the superposition of the flaring component and slowly varying background component. We also find that the slopes of the HWB trend become smaller at higher flux levels, which indicates the energy-dependent acceleration processes of the radiative particles. For the X-ray band, we discover a trend transition from HWB to softer when brighter (SWB) to HWB. We consider that the X-ray emission is composed of both the synchrotron tail and the synchrotron self-Compton components, which could be described by two log-parabolic functions. By varying the peak frequency, we reproduce the observed trend transition in a quantitative manner. For the γ-ray band, we find the SWB trend, which could be explained naturally if a very-high-energy γ-ray background component exists. Our study elucidates the variation mechanism of intermediate synchrotron-peaked BL Lac objects.

M-type stars are crucial for stellar activity studies because they cover two types of magnetic dynamos and are particularly intriguing for habitability studies due to their abundance and long lifespans during the main-sequence stage. In this paper, we used the LAMOST DR9 catalog and the GALEX UV archive data to investigate the chromospheric and UV activities of M-type stars. All the chromospheric and UV activity indices clearly show that the saturated and unsaturated regimes, and the well-known activity–rotation relation, are consistent with previous studies. Both the FUV and NUV activity indices exhibit a single-peaked distribution, while the Hα and Ca ii H&amp;K indices show a distinct double-peaked distribution. The gap between these peaks suggests a rapid transition from a saturated population to an unsaturated one. The smoothly varying distributions of different subtypes suggest a rotation-dependent dynamo for both early-type (partly convective) to late-type (fully convective) M stars. We identified a group of stars with high UV activity above the saturation regime (log ) but low chromospheric activity, and the underlying reason is unknown. By calculating the continuously habitable zone and the UV habitable zone for each star, we found that about 70% stars in the total sample and 40% stars within 100 pc are located in the overlapping region of these two habitable zones, indicating that a number of M stars are potentially habitable. Finally, we examined the possibility of UV activity studies of M stars using the China Space Station Telescope.

总结: 
磁流体力学kink波是由于对结构化介质的扰动而自然形成的，例如，日冕环的横向震荡。研究结果表明，KHI诱导的湍流动力学包括两个阶段：首先是经典的KHI湍流层生长，然后根据经典衰减模型得出了对振动和湍流加热的准确预测；其次，主导湍流运动正在衰减，发现经典的能量衰减模型能够准确预测加热的过程。我们的研究表明，我们可以建立湍流演化的简单模型，但所产生的衰减轮廓与通常用于对抗理论和观测的线性理论不同。 <div>
Magnetohydrodynamic kink waves naturally form as a consequence of perturbations to a structured medium, for example, transverse oscillations of coronal loops. Linear theory has provided many insights into the evolution of linear oscillations, and results from these models are often applied to infer information about the solar corona from observed wave periods and damping times. However, simulations show that nonlinear kink waves can host the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (KHI), which subsequently creates turbulence in the loop, dynamics that are beyond linear models. In this paper we investigate the evolution of KHI-induced turbulence on the surface of a flux tube where a nonlinear fundamental kink mode has been excited. We control our numerical experiment so that we induce the KHI without exciting resonant absorption. We find two stages in the KHI turbulence dynamics. In the first stage, we show that the classic model of a KHI turbulent layer growing at ∝t is applicable. We adapt this model to make accurate predictions of the damping of the oscillation and turbulent heating as a consequence of the KHI dynamics. In the second stage, the now dominant turbulent motions are undergoing decay. We find that the classic model of energy decay proportional to t−2 approximately holds and provides an accurate prediction of the heating in this phase. Our results show that we can develop simple models for the turbulent evolution of a nonlinear kink wave, but the damping profiles produced are distinct from those of linear theory that are commonly used to confront theory and observations.

总结：<br />
本研究通过对大麦哲伦星云内九个巨大分子云的12CO和13CO Atacama大型毫米／亚毫米阵列地图进行研究，发现了星形反馈对这些云的重力状态产生了影响。我们使用了分子发射分割谱聚类算法来识别离散的亚结构，“团块”，并补充了近期星形成的三个迹象。研究结果表明，这些云中存在增加的湍流现象，而湍流宽度与团块表面密度和星形活动迹象均存在相关性，暗示星体能量注入在团块的动力状态中起着重要作用。12CO团块通常比13CO团块更少地被引力束缚，随着星形活动迹象的增加，动能与引力势能比例也可能会上升。进一步的多线分析可能更好地约束这些计算中的假设。 <div>
To investigate the effects of stellar feedback on the gravitational state of giant molecular clouds (GMCs), we study 12CO and 13CO Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array maps of nine GMCs distributed throughout the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the nearest star-forming galaxy to our own. We perform noise and resolution matching on the sample, working at a common resolution of 3.″5 (0.85 pc at the LMC distance of 50 kpc), and we use the Spectral Clustering for Molecular Emission Segmentation clustering algorithm to identify discrete substructure, or “clumps.” We supplement these data with three tracers of recent star formation: 8 μm surface brightness, continuum-subtracted Hα flux, and interstellar radiation field energy density inferred from dust emission. The 12CO clumps identified cover a range of 3.6 dex in luminosity-based mass and 2.4 dex in average 8 μm surface brightness, representative of the wide range of conditions of the interstellar medium in the LMC. Our observations suggest evidence for increased turbulence in these clouds. While the turbulent linewidths are correlated with clump surface density, in agreement with previous observations, we find even better correlation with the three star formation activity tracers considered, suggesting stellar energy injection plays a significant role in the dynamical state of the clumps. The excess linewidths we measure do not appear to result from opacity broadening. 12CO clumps are found to be typically less gravitationally bound than 13CO clumps, with some evidence of the kinetic-to-gravitational potential energy ratio increasing with star formation tracers. Further multiline analysis may better constrain the assumptions made in these calculations.

Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) are charged particles that reach the heliosphere almost isotropically in a wide energy range. In the inner heliosphere, the GCR flux is modulated by solar activity so that only energetic GCRs reach the lower layers of the solar atmosphere. In this work, we propose that high-energy GCRs can be used to explore the solar magnetic fields at low coronal altitudes. We used GCR data collected by the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov observatory to construct maps of GCR flux coming from the Sun’s sky direction and studied the observed GCR deficit, known as Sun shadow (SS), over a 6 yr period (2016–2021) with a time cadence of 27.3 days. We confirm that the SS is correlated with sunspot number, but we focus on the relationship between the photospheric solar magnetic field measured at different heliolatitudes and the relative GCR deficit at different energies. We found a linear relationship between the relative deficit of GCRs represented by the depth of the SS and the solar magnetic field. This relationship is evident in the observed energy range of 2.5–226 TeV, but is strongest in the range of 12.4 33.4 TeV, which implies that this is the best energy range to study the evolution of magnetic fields in the low solar atmosphere.

We measure the evolution of the rest-frame near-ultraviolet (NUV)−V colors for early-type galaxies in clusters at 0 < z < 1.1 using data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program, CFHT Large Area U-band Deep Survey, and local Sloan Digital Sky Survey clusters observed with Galaxy Evolution Explorer. Our results show that there is an excess in the ultraviolet spectrum in most quiescent galaxies (compared to the expectations from models fitting their optical/infrared colors and spectra) below z ∼ 0.6, beyond which the excess UV emission fades rapidly. This evolution of the UV color is only consistent with the presence of a highly evolved, hot horizontal branch subpopulation in these galaxies (among the majority of cool and optically bright stars), comprising on average 10% of the total stellar mass and forming at z > 3. The blue UV colors of early-type galaxies at low–intermediate redshifts are likely driven by this subpopulation being enriched in helium up to ∼44%. At z > 0.8 (when the extra UV component has not yet appeared) the data allow us to constrain the star formation histories of galaxies by fitting models to the evolution of their UV colors: we find that the epoch at which the stellar populations formed lies in the range 3 < zform < 10 (corresponding to 0.5–2.2 Gyr after the Big Bang) with a star formation e-folding timescale of τ = 0.35–0.7 Gyr, suggesting that these galaxies formed the majority of stars at very high redshift, with a brief yet intense burst of star formation activity. The star formation history and chemical evolution of early-type galaxies resemble those of globular clusters, albeit on much larger scales.

<title>A New Dissociative Galaxy Cluster Merger: RM J150822.0+575515.2</title>

Galaxy cluster mergers that exhibit clear dissociation between their dark matter, intracluster gas, and stellar components are great laboratories for probing dark matter properties. Mergers that are binary and in the plane of the sky have the additional advantage of being simpler to model, allowing for a better understanding of the merger dynamics. We report the discovery of a galaxy cluster merger with all these characteristics and present a multiwavelength analysis of the system, which was found via a search in the redMaPPer optical cluster catalog. We perform a galaxy redshift survey to confirm the two subclusters are at the same redshift (0.541, with 368 ± 519 km s−1 line-of-sight velocity difference between them). The X-ray morphology shows two surface brightness peaks between the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). We construct weak-lensing mass maps that reveal a mass peak associated with each subcluster. Fitting Navarro–Frenk–White profiles to the lensing data, we find masses of M200c = 36 ± 11 × 1013 and 38 ± 11 × 1013M⊙h−1 for the southern and northern subclusters, respectively. From the mass maps, we infer that the two mass peaks are separated by kpc along the merger axis, whereas the two BCGs are separated by 697 kpc. We also present deep GMRT 650 MHz data to search for a radio relic or halo and find none. Using the observed merger parameters, we find analog systems in cosmological n-body simulations and infer that this system is observed between 96 and 236 Myr after pericenter, with the merger axis within 28° of the plane of the sky.

<title>Unusually Low-frequency Whistler-mode Waves and Their Association with High-energy Protons Observed Upstream of Martian Bow Shock</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad333d</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Whistler-mode waves upstream of planetary bow shock are often referred to as “1-Hz waves” due to the center of their observed frequency range being at ∼1 Hz. A series of whistler-mode waves were observed upstream of the Martian bow shock by MAVEN on 2015 August 14, with unusually low frequencies centered at ∼0.4 Hz. These waves were accompanied (though not synchronized) by the significant flux enhancement of high-energy protons up to ∼10 keV. By analyzing the wave dispersion property and the wave–particle interaction condition, we find that the observed whistler-mode waves have the potential of resonating with protons of ∼1 keV with large pitch angles up to nearly perpendicular to the background magnetic field, thereby providing a feasible means of accounting for proton acceleration. Our results indicate the possible origin of energized protons in the Martian environment through the interaction with whistler-mode waves, and their potential relationship with the unique upstream conditions.

<title>A Consistent Explanation for the Unusual Initial Mass Function and Star Formation Rate in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ)</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad33c0</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad33c0</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We examine various physical processes that may explain the shallow high-mass slope of the initial mass function (IMF), as well as the low star formation rate (SFR) in star-forming molecular clouds (MCs) in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). We show that the strong tidal field and shear experienced by the CMZ have opposite effects on the collapse of density fluctuations and cannot explain these properties. Similarly, we show that the intense magnetic field in the CMZ provides a negligible pressure support and, for the high densities at play, should not modify the probability density function of the turbulent gas flow, thus affecting negligibly the IMF. However, we show that, in contrast to the MCs in the Galactic disk, the ones in the CMZ experience only one single episode of turbulence cascade. Indeed, their rather short lifetime, due to their high mean densities, is similar to one typical turbulence crossing time. Consequently, according to the Hennebelle–Chabrier theory of star formation, within this “single turbulence cascade episode,” the cloud experiences one single field of turbulence-induced density fluctuations, leading eventually to gravitationally unstable cores. As shown in Hennebelle & Chabrier (2013), this yields a shallower IMF than usual and leads to the correct observed slope for the CMZ star-forming clouds. Similarly, this single large-scale turbulence event within the cloud lifetime yields a 5–6 times lower SFR than under usual conditions, in agreement with the observed values. Therefore, we suggest that this “single turbulence cascade” scenario can explain both the shallow IMF and low SFR of clouds in the CMZ.

<title>Magnetic Flux Plays an Important Role during a Black Hole X-Ray Binary Outburst in Radiative Two-temperature General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Black hole (Bh) X-ray binaries cycle through different spectral states of accretion over the course of months to years. Although persistent changes in the Bh mass accretion rate are generally recognized as the most important component of state transitions, it is becoming increasingly evident that magnetic fields play a similarly important role. In this article, we present the first radiative two-temperature general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations in which an accretion disk transitions from a quiescent state at an accretion rate of to a hard-intermediate state at an accretion rate of . This huge parameter space in mass accretion rate is bridged by artificially rescaling the gas density scale of the simulations. We present two jetted BH models with varying degrees of magnetic flux saturation. We demonstrate that in “standard and normal evolution” models, which are unsaturated with magnetic flux, the hot torus collapses into a thin and cold accretion disk when . On the other hand, in “magnetically arrested disk” models, which are fully saturated with vertical magnetic flux, the plasma remains mostly hot with substructures that condense into cold clumps of gas when . This suggests that the spectral signatures observed during state transitions are closely tied to the level of magnetic flux saturation.

<title>Phase and Morphology of Water-ice Grains Formed in a Cryogenic Laboratory Plasma</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad34b5</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad34b5</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Grains of ice are formed spontaneously when water vapor is injected into a weakly ionized laboratory plasma in which the background gas has been cooled to cryogenic temperatures comparable to those of deep space. These ice grains are levitated indefinitely within the plasma so that their time evolution can be observed under free-floating conditions. Using microscope imaging, ice grains are shown to have a spindle-like fractal structure and grow over time. Both crystalline and amorphous phases of ice are observed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. A mix of crystalline and amorphous grains coexists under certain thermal conditions, and a linear mixing model is used on the ice absorption band surrounding 3.2 μm to examine the ice phase composition and its temporal stability. The extinction spectrum is also affected by inelastic scattering as grains grow, and characteristic grain radii are obtained from Mie scattering theory and compared to size measurements from direct imaging. Observations are used to compare possible ice nucleation mechanisms, and it is concluded that nucleation is likely catalyzed by ions, as ice does not nucleate in the absence of plasma and impurities are not detected. Ice grain properties and infrared extinction spectra show similarity to observations of some astrophysical ices observed in protoplanetary disks, implying that the fractal morphology of the ice and observed processes of homogeneous ice nucleation could occur as well in such astrophysical environments with weakly ionized conditions.

<title>The Relativistic Spin Precession in the Compact Double Neutron Star System PSR J1946+2052</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We observe systematic profile changes in the visible pulsar of the compact double neutron star system PSR J1946+2052 using observations with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The interpulse of PSR J1946+2052 changed from a single-peak to a double-peak shape from 2018–2021. We attribute this evolution as the result of the relativistic spin precession of the pulsar. With the high sensitivity of FAST, we also measure significant polarization for the first time, allowing us to model this with the precessional rotating vector model. Assuming, to the first order, a circular hollow-cone-like emission beam pattern and taking the validity of general relativity (GR), we derive the binary’s orbital inclination angle ( ) and pulsar’s spin geometry. The pulsar’s spin vector and the orbital angular momentum vector are found to be only slightly misaligned ( ). The quoted uncertainties do not reflect the systematic uncertainties introduced by our model assumptions. By simulating future observations of profile and polarization evolution, we estimate that we could constrain the precession rate within a 43% uncertainty in 9 yr. Hence, we suggest that the system’s profile evolution could be combined with precise pulsar timing to test GR in the future.

<div> 关键词: 太阳-作为-恒星，太阳耀斑， CHASE，Hα光谱，光谱特征
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了X1.0级太阳耀斑的太阳-作为-恒星的光谱特征。研究使用了中国Hα太阳探测器获取的高分辨率光谱数据，并采用基于离散傅立叶变换的噪声减少算法增强了空间积分Hα光谱的信噪比。研究发现，耀斑的平均Hα轮廓表现出线心的强发射和明显的线增宽，还呈现出明显的红偏斜，对应着约50 km/s的红移速度，随时间略有减小，与先前的结果一致。此外，研究还发现，空间积分区域的大小对耀斑太阳-作为-恒星Hα轮廓特征的影响。研究估计了检测到红偏斜的适用区域的上限。同时，研究还发现，如果进一步在时间域内对Hα光谱进行平均，那么光谱的等效宽度的强度会被显著低估。 <div>
Sun-as-a-star spectroscopic characteristics of solar flares can be used as a benchmark for the detection and analysis of stellar flares. Here, we study the Sun-as-a-star properties of an X1.0 solar flare, using high-resolution spectroscopic data obtained by the Chinese Hα Solar Explorer (CHASE). A noise reduction algorithm based on discrete Fourier transformation is first employed to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the space-integral Hα spectrum, with a focus on its typical characteristics. For the flare of interest, we find that the average Hα profile displays a strong emission at the line center and an obvious line broadening. It also presents a clear red asymmetry, corresponding to a redshift velocity of around 50 km s−1 that slightly decreases with time, consistent with previous results. Furthermore, we study how the size of the space-integral region affects the characteristics of the flare's Sun-as-a-star Hα profile. It is found that although the redshift velocity calculated from the Hα profile remains unchanged, the detectability of the characteristics weakens as the space-integral region becomes larger. An upper limit on the size of the target region where the red asymmetry is detectable is estimated. It is also found that the intensity in Hα profiles, measured by the equivalent widths of the spectra, are significantly underestimated if the Hα spectra are further averaged in the time domain.

总结: <br />
本研究调查了彗星撞击如何影响热木星的大气组成和化学性质。他们使用参数化的彗星撞击模型和大气模型，发现即使是小型撞击体也能导致大气化学成分的显著短期改变，包括水、CO和CO2丰度的大幅增加，以及可观察的碳氢化合物（如CH4）几乎完全消失。这些效应与大气C/O比和金属丰度的改变成比例。因此，彗星撞击可能显著改变热木星的大气组成，可能会打破大气C/O比与行星形成位置之间的联系。 <div>
Impacts from icy and rocky bodies have helped shape the composition of Solar System objects; for example, the Earth–Moon system, or the recent impact of comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter. It is likely that such impacts also shape the composition of exoplanetary systems. Here, we investigate how cometary impacts might affect the atmospheric composition/chemistry of hot Jupiters, which are prime targets for characterization. We introduce a parameterized cometary impact model that includes thermal ablation and pressure driven breakup, which we couple with the 1D “radiative-convective” atmospheric model ATMO, including disequilibrium chemistry. We use this model to investigate a wide range of impactor masses and compositions, including those based on observations of Solar System comets, and interstellar ices (with JWST). We find that even a small impactor (R = 2.5 km) can lead to significant short-term changes in the atmospheric chemistry, including a factor >10 enhancement in H2O, CO, and CO2 abundances, as well as atmospheric opacity more generally, and the near-complete removal of observable hydrocarbons, such as CH4, from the upper atmosphere. These effects scale with the change in atmospheric C/O ratio and metallicity. Potentially observable changes are possible for a body that has undergone significant/continuous bombardment, such that the global atmospheric chemistry has been impacted. Our works reveals that cometary impacts can significantly alter or pollute the atmospheric composition/chemistry of hot Jupiters. These changes have the potential to mute/break the proposed link between atmospheric C/O ratio and planet formation location relative to key snowlines in the natal protoplanetary disk.

We present deep XMM-Newton, Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, and upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope observations of Abell 746, a cluster that hosts a plethora of diffuse emission sources that provide evidence for the acceleration of relativistic particles. Our new XMM-Newton images reveal a complex morphology of the thermal gas with several substructures. We observe an asymmetric temperature distribution across the cluster: the southern regions exhibit higher temperatures, reaching ∼9 keV, while the northern regions have lower temperatures (≤4 keV), likely due to a complex merger. We find evidence of three surface brightness edges and one candidate edge, of which three are merger-driven shock fronts. Combining our new data with published LOw-Frequency ARray observations has unveiled the nature of diffuse sources in this system. The bright NW relic shows thin filaments and a high degree of polarization with aligned magnetic field vectors. We detect a density jump, aligned with the fainter relic to the north. To the south, we detect high-temperature regions, consistent with the shock-heated regions and a density jump coincident with the northern tip of the southern radio structure. Its integrated spectrum shows a high-frequency steepening. Lastly, we find that the cluster hosts large-scale radio halo emission. A comparison of the thermal and nonthermal emission reveals an anticorrelation between the bright radio and X-ray features at the center. Our findings suggest that Abell 746 is a complex system that involves multiple mergers.

<div> 高红移星系、重金属调查、质量动力学、恒星形成、质量增长<br />总结:<br />这篇论文介绍了重金属调查项目，通过对21个质量巨大的静止星系进行深入观测，成功获取了它们的光谱红移和恒星速度分散度等信息。研究发现，大多数星系呈现出质量动力学质量与恒星质量之比和恒星速度分散度之间强烈的相关性，暗示着初始质量函数可能在宇宙早期就已经存在差异。对于遥远的静止星系的观测结果，也暗示了它们不会简单地在今天的巨型早期星系内部持续增长，其演化过程更为复杂。 <div>
In this paper, we present the Heavy Metal Survey, which obtained ultradeep medium-resolution spectra of 21 massive quiescent galaxies at 1.3 < z < 2.3 with Keck/LRIS and MOSFIRE. With integration times of up to 16 hr per band per galaxy, we observe numerous Balmer and metal absorption lines in atmospheric windows. We successfully derive spectroscopic redshifts for all 21 galaxies, and for 19 we also measure stellar velocity dispersions (σv), ages, and elemental abundances, as detailed in an accompanying paper. Except for one emission-line active galactic nucleus, all galaxies are confirmed as quiescent through their faint or absent Hα emission and evolved stellar spectra. For most galaxies exhibiting faint Hα, elevated [N ii]/Hα suggests a non-star-forming origin. We calculate dynamical masses (Mdyn) by combining σv with structural parameters obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope COSMOS(-DASH) survey and compare them with stellar masses (M*) derived using spectrophotometric modeling, considering various assumptions. For a fixed initial mass function (IMF), we observe a strong correlation between Mdyn/M* and σv. This correlation may suggest that a varying IMF, with high-σv galaxies being more bottom heavy, was already in place at z ∼ 2. When implementing the σv-dependent IMF found in the cores of nearby early-type galaxies and correcting for biases in our stellar mass and size measurements, we find a low scatter in Mdyn/M* of 0.14 dex. However, these assumptions result in unphysical stellar masses, which exceed the dynamical masses by 34%. This tension suggests that distant quiescent galaxies do not simply grow inside-out into today’s massive early-type galaxies and the evolution is more complicated.

总结:<br />文章研究了使用密度场重构来恢复宇宙中小尺度线性信息的方法，提出了一个准确的模拟器，用于模拟预重构、后重构和交叉功率谱，以提高宇宙学参数的约束。研究表明，联合分析前后重构的功率谱可以有效提取高阶统计信息。相比仅使用前重构的功率谱，使用联合功率谱可以显著改善对宇宙学参数和BAO/RSD参数的约束，突显了联合分析的高效性和实用性。 <div>
The small-scale linear information in galaxy samples typically lost during nonlinear growth can be restored to a certain level by the density field reconstruction, which has been demonstrated for improving the precision of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements. As proposed in the literature, a joint analysis of the power spectrum before and after the reconstruction enables an efficient extraction of information carried by high-order statistics. However, the statistics of the postreconstruction density field are difficult to model. In this work, we circumvent this issue by developing an accurate emulator for the prereconstructed, postreconstructed, and cross-power spectra ( , Ppost, Pcross) up to k = 0.5 h Mpc−1 based on the Dark QuestN-body simulations. The accuracy of the emulator is at the percent level; namely, the error of the emulated monopole and quadrupole of the power spectra is less than 1% and 10% of the ground truth, respectively. A fit to an example power spectrum using the emulator shows that the constraints on cosmological parameters get largely improved using +Ppost+Pcross with , compared to that derived from alone; namely, the constraints on (Ωm, H0, σ8) are tightened by ∼41%–55%, and the uncertainties of the derived BAO and RSD parameters (α⊥, α∣∣, fσ8) shrink by ∼28%–54%, respectively. This highlights the complementarity among , Ppost, and Pcross, which demonstrates the efficiency and practicability of a joint , Ppost, and Pcross analysis for cosmological implications.

总结:<br /><br />该研究调查了17颗毫秒脉冲星(MSPs)的排放几何参数与抖动噪声之间的关系。通过假设抖动噪声仅由相位脉冲变化引起，前者可以被建模为等离子体流速的变化，导致相对于预测时间的脉冲到达时间的变化。在多种排放状态的脉冲星磁层模型中，等离子体流速与排放状态相关联，而排放状态的改变对应于等离子体流速的变化，引起脉冲到达时间的变化。我们计算出每颗MSP报道的抖动噪声对排放状态的最大改变。利用结果，我们发现MSPs具有相对较大的斜率角，这与观测结果一致，并且抖动噪声表现出对频率的依赖性。我们发现样本中的抖动噪声显示出指数衰减的特性，这个特性结合了斜率角和旋转周期，揭示了这三个参数之间的相关性。这表明抖动噪声的大小可能是特定于MSPs的。我们讨论了抖动噪声如何与MSP的演化有关。 <div>
The relationships between several parameters of an emission geometry and jitter noise in 17 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are investigated. By assuming the jitter noise is due only to a pulse variation in phase, the former can be modeled as changes in the plasma flow rate leading to variation in the measured pulse arrival time relative to the predicted time. In the model for pulsar magnetospheres with multiple emission states, the plasma flow is associated with the emission states, and a change in the emission state corresponds to a change in the plasma flow causing variation in the pulse arrival time. These can be specified in an emission geometry defined by the obliquity and viewing angles, measured from the rotation axis to the magnetic axis and to the line of sight, respectively. We calculate the maximum change in the emission state based on the reported jitter noise for each of the MSPs. Using the results, we show that the MSPs possess relatively large obliquity angles, which is consistent with observation, and the jitter noise exhibits dependency on frequency. We find that the jitter noise in our sample displays an exponential decay as a function that combines the obliquity angle and the rotation period, revealing the correlation among the three parameters. This suggests that the magnitude of the jitter noise is likely specific to an MSP. We discuss how jitter noise may be related to the evolution of an MSP.

总结: 这篇文章研究了星暴星系中的超新星反馈对星系中气体流动的影响。作者在10kpc尺度上进行了高分辨率模拟，并发现星暴区域中的超新星驱动的气体流动更加热，速度更快，含有更多的冷相气体，而星系范围内的超新星驱动气体流动效果更好，可以更有效地清除盘面上的冷气体。这些研究结果有助于更好地理解星暴星系中的物理过程。 <div>
We present the fifth simulation in the Cholla Galactic OutfLow Simulation (CGOLS) project—a set of isolated starburst galaxy simulations modeled over large scales (10 kpc) at uniformly high resolution (Δx ≈ 5 pc). Supernova feedback in this simulation is implemented as a disk-wide distribution of clusters, and we assess the impact of this geometry on several features of the resulting outflow, including the radial profiles of various phases; mass, momentum, and energy outflow rates; covering fraction of cool gas; mock absorption-line spectra; and X-ray surface brightness. In general, we find that the outflow generated by this model is cooler, slower, and contains more mass in the cool phase than a more centrally concentrated outflow driven by a similar number of supernovae. In addition, the energy loading factors in the hot phase are an order of magnitude lower, indicating much larger losses due to radiative cooling in the outflow. However, coupling between the hot and cool phases is more efficient than in the nuclear burst case, with almost 50% of the total outflowing energy flux carried by the cool phase at a radial distance of 5 kpc. These physical differences have corresponding signatures in observable quantities: the covering fraction of cool gas is much larger, and there is greater evidence of absorption in low and intermediate ionization energy lines. Taken together, our simulations indicate that centrally concentrated starbursts are more effective at driving hot, low-density outflows that will expand far into the halo, while galaxy-wide bursts may be more effective at removing cool gas from the disk.

在本研究中，通过对Hercules UFD的新旧观测数据进行重新分析，发现了一个潜在的新成员星。我们测量了其速度离散度，并进行了动力模型的比较，结果显示速度梯度较小，并且无法检测出来。通过对系统的潮汐半径演化的分析，我们认为Hercules目前正在其扩展的恒星晕中发生潮汐破碎，而且当前观测数据集无法检测出速度梯度的变化。因此，我们推断Hercules UFD可能正在进行潮汐破碎。 <br /><br />总结: <br />重新分析了Hercules UFD的观测数据，发现了一个新的潜在成员星，并测量了速度离散度。通过动力模型比较和潮汐半径演化分析，推断Hercules UFD可能正在进行潮汐破碎。 <div>
The Hercules ultrafaint dwarf galaxy (UFD) has long been hypothesized to be tidally disrupting, yet no conclusive evidence has been found for tidal disruption owing partly to difficulties in identifying Hercules member stars. In this work, we present a homogeneous reanalysis of new and existing observations of Hercules, including the detection of a new potential member star located ∼1° (∼1.7 kpc) west of the center of the system. In addition to measuring the line-of-sight velocity gradient, we compare predictions from dynamical models of stream formation to these observations. We report an updated velocity dispersion measurement based on 28 stars, km s−1, which is significantly lower than previous measurements. We find that the line-of-sight velocity gradient is km s−1 kpc along the major axis of Hercules, consistent with zero within 1σ. Our dynamical models of stream formation, on the other hand, can reproduce the morphology of the Hercules UFD, specifically the misalignment between the elongation and the orbital motion direction. Additionally, these dynamical models indicate that any radial velocity gradient from tidal disruption would be too small, km s−1 kpc, to be detectable with current sample sizes. Combined with our analysis of the tidal radius evolution of the system as a function of its orbital phase, we argue that it is likely that Hercules is indeed currently undergoing tidal disruption in its extended stellar halo with a line-of-sight velocity gradient too small to be detected with current observational data sets.

总结:<br /><br />这项研究利用JWST的NIRSpec+MIRI积分场装置对5个年轻原恒星进行了观测，获得了2.9–28μm的光谱立方体数据。研究展示了这些原恒星产生的不断上升的连续辐射、深层冰吸收、H2、H i和[Fe ii]的发射，以及CO的发射和吸收。同时，研究还显示了所有原恒星的散射光腔，并检测到了其中的准直喷流。在准直喷流中还检测到了[Fe ii]和一些其他气体的发射。这些数据表明了准直喷流中存在着原子/离子气体，周围环绕着温暖的分子气体，这些研究有助于我们更好地了解原恒星的形成和演化。 <div>
Investigating Protostellar Accretion is a Cycle 1 JWST program using the NIRSpec+MIRI integral field units to obtain 2.9–28 μm spectral cubes of five young protostars with luminosities of 0.2–10,000 L⊙ in their primary accretion phase. This paper introduces the NIRSpec 2.9–5.3 μm data of the inner 840–9000 au with spatial resolutions from 28 to 300 au. The spectra show rising continuum emission; deep ice absorption; emission from H2, H i, and [Fe ii]; and the CO fundamental series in emission and absorption. Maps of the continuum emission show scattered light cavities for all five protostars. In the cavities, collimated jets are detected in [Fe ii] for the four <320 L⊙ protostars, two of which are additionally traced in Brα. Knots of [Fe ii] emission are detected toward the most luminous protostar, and knots of [Fe ii] emission with dynamical times of <30 yr are found in the jets of the others. While only one jet is traced in H2, knots of H2 and CO are detected in the jets of four protostars. H2 is seen extending through the cavities, showing that they are filled by warm molecular gas. Bright H2 emission is seen along the walls of a single cavity, while in three cavities narrow shells of H2 emission are found, one of which has an [Fe ii] knot at its apex. These data show cavities containing collimated jets traced in atomic/ionic gas surrounded by warm molecular gas in a wide-angle wind and/or gas accelerated by bow shocks in the jets.

<title>Naked Forward Shock Seen in the TeV Afterglow Data of GRB 221009A</title>

<div> 关键词: TeV gamma-ray afterglow, GRB 221009A, LHAASO Collaboration, activation time, jet component<br />
总结: 通过LHAASO合作组报道的GRB 221009A的早期TeV伽马射线余辉光变曲线，可以确定主喷流组件的激活时间，了解到其大约在GBM触发时间后约200秒时发生，并紧随GBM饱和时刻。研究结果表明，虽然LHAASO的数据不能排除均匀周围介质场景，但原始风场情形更为可取，并与恒星泡大小预期非常吻合。初期光变曲线增长主要受射流内部过程或伽马-伽马吸收影响，激活加速过程或减少内部伽马-伽马吸收可以自然地解释初始快速通量增加。随后的慢通量增长阶段可与产生区域中粒子积累过程相关联。此阶段的持续时间几乎可以独立于参数地确定喷流的初始洛伦兹因子Γ0≈600和磁场强度。这些数值似乎很好地匹配先前通过GRB辐射的谱建模揭示出的数值。<br /><br /> <div>
We explore the implications of the light curve of the early TeV gamma-ray afterglow of GRB 221009A reported by the LHAASO Collaboration. We show that the reported offset of the reference time, T*, allows the determination of the activation time of the main jet component, which occurs approximately 200 s after the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) trigger time and closely precedes the moment at which GBM was saturated. We find that while the LHAASO data do not exclude the homogeneous circumburst medium scenario, the progenitor wind scenario looks preferable, finding excellent agreement with the expected size of the stellar bubble. We conclude that the initial growth of the light curve is dominated by processes internal to the jet or by gamma-gamma attenuation on the photons emitted during the prompt phase. Namely, either the activation of the acceleration process or the decrease of internal gamma-gamma absorption can naturally explain the initial rapid flux increase. The subsequent slow flux growth phase observed up to T* + 18 s can be related to the process of particle accumulation in the production region. The duration of this phase allows an almost parameter-independent determination of the jet’s initial Lorentz factor, Γ0 ≈ 600, and magnetic field strength, . These values appear to match well those previously revealed through spectral modeling of the GRB emission.

A fraction of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) with signs of interaction with a dense circumstellar matter are preceded by bright precursor emission. While the precursors are likely caused by a mass ejection before core collapse, their mechanism to power energetic bursts—sometimes reaching 1048–1049 erg, which is larger than the binding energies of red supergiant envelopes—is still under debate. Remarkably, such a huge energy deposition should result in an almost complete envelope ejection and hence a strong sign of interaction, but the observed SNe with precursors show in fact typical properties among the interacting SNe. More generally, the observed luminosity of 1040−1042 erg s−1 is shown to be challenging for a single SN progenitor. To resolve these tensions, we propose a scenario where the progenitor is in a binary system with a compact object (CO) and an outburst from the star leads to a super-Eddington accretion onto the CO. We show that for sufficiently short separations outbursts with moderate initial kinetic energies of 1046–1047 erg can be energized by the accreting CO so that their radiative output can be consistent with the observed precursors. We discuss the implications of our model in relation to CO binaries detectable with Gaia and gravitational-wave detectors.

<title>Large Fluctuations within 1 au in Protoplanetary Disks</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3731</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3731</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Protoplanetary disks are often assumed to change slowly and smoothly during planet formation. Here, we investigate the time evolution of isolated disks subject to viscosity and a disk wind. The viscosity is assumed to increase rapidly at around 900 K due to thermal ionization of alkali metals, or thermionic and ion emission from dust, and the onset of magnetorotational instability (MRI). The disks generally undergo large, rapid fluctuations for a wide range of time-averaged mass accretion rates. Fluctuations involve coupled waves in temperature and surface density that move radially in either direction through the inner 1.5 au of the disk. Two types of waves are seen with radial speeds of roughly 50 and 1000 cm s−1, respectively. The pattern of waves repeats with a period of roughly 10,000 yr that depends weakly on the average mass accretion rate. Viscous transport due to MRI is confined to the inner disk. This region is resupplied by mass flux from the outer disk driven by the disk wind. Interior to 1 au, the temperature and surface density can vary by a factor of 2–10 on timescales of years to kiloyears. The stellar mass accretion rate varies by 3 orders of magnitude on a similar timescale. This behavior lasts for at least 1 Myr for initial disks comparable to the minimum-mass solar nebula.

<div> 关键词: Rossby waves, inertial oscillations, 3D numerical simulation, Sun's convection zone, radiative interior

总结:
Rossby波和其他惯性振荡在太阳对流层的观测燃起了人们对利用这些波来探测太阳内部的希望。研究人员通过在球形几何中建立的3D数值模拟模型，成功模拟了太阳的对流区和上部辐射内部，并观察到了多种惯性振荡，包括扇形和饼状赤道Rossby波、逆行混合惯性模式、顺行热Rossby波以及最近观测到的高频逆行（HFR）涡度模式，以及可能是这些HFR模式的纬向谐波。模拟结果表明，扇形和饼状Rossby波在辐射内部和对流层中是普遍存在的。研究人员认为，在模拟中，在辐射内部和对流区存在两种不同的Rossby波系列。最后，研究人员认为，出现在对流区的许多逆行惯性波，包括HFR模式，实际上都是相关的，是与顺行热Rossby波混合的纬向谐波。 <br /><br /> <div>
Recent observations of Rossby waves and other more exotic forms of inertial oscillations in the Sun’s convection zone have kindled the hope that such waves might be used as a seismic probe of the Sun's interior. Here, we present a 3D numerical simulation in spherical geometry that models the Sun’s convection zone and upper radiative interior. This model features a wide variety of inertial oscillations, including both sectoral and tesseral equatorial Rossby waves, retrograde mixed inertial modes, prograde thermal Rossby waves, the recently observed high-frequency retrograde (HFR) vorticity modes, and what may be latitudinal overtones of these HFR modes. With this model, we demonstrate that sectoral and tesseral Rossby waves are ubiquitous within the radiative interior as well as within the convection zone. We suggest that there are two different Rossby-wave families in this simulation that live in different wave cavities: one in the radiative interior and one in the convection zone. Finally, we suggest that many of the retrograde inertial waves that appear in the convection zone, including the HFR modes, are in fact all related, being latitudinal overtones that are mixed modes with the prograde thermal Rossby waves.

总结: <br /><br />这篇文章报告了利用CHIME对三个二元脉冲星的观测结果。研究人员首次在所有三个脉冲星二元系统中探测到了Shapiro时间延迟，并且利用2-4年的CHIME/脉冲定时数据测量了它们的质量。他们还通过观测轨道前进量，精确估计了PSR J1518+4904的伴星质量，以及PSR J2023+2853的伴星可能是高质量白矮星。研究人员还发现PSR J0218+4232的观测轨道周期有显著变化，由此推断了该系统的距离。这项工作展示了CHIME/脉冲系统通过高频率观测，可以在短时间内探测和精确测量二元脉冲星的广义相对论效应。 <div>
We performed near-daily observations of the binary pulsars PSR J0218+4232, PSR J1518+4904, and PSR J2023+2853 with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME). For the first time, we detected the Shapiro time delay in all three pulsar binary systems, using only 2–4 yr of CHIME/Pulsar timing data. We measured the pulsar masses to be M⊙, M⊙, and M⊙, respectively. The companion mass to PSR J0218+4232 was found to be M⊙. We constrained the mass of the neutron star companion of PSR J1518+4904 to be M⊙, using the observed apsidal motion as a constraint on the mass estimation. The binary companion to PSR J2023+2853 was found to have a mass of M⊙; in the context of the near-circular orbit, this mass estimate suggests that the companion to PSR J2023+2853 is likely a high-mass white dwarf. By comparing the timing model obtained for PSR J0218+4232 with previous observations, we found a significant change in the observed orbital period of the system of ; we determined that this variation arises from “Shklovskii acceleration” due to the relative motion of the binary system, and used this measurement to estimate a distance of d = (6.7 ± 1.0) kpc to PSR J0218+4232. This work demonstrates the capability of high-cadence observations, enabled by the CHIME/Pulsar system, to detect and refine general-relativistic effects of binary pulsars over short observing timescales.

总结:
本文研究了本地集团中十个矮星系的星体形成历史(SFH)，使用了近红外颜色-颜色图和盖亚测距数据，去除了前景矮星，得到了包括红超巨星和半渐近巨星分支星的样本。通过颜色-星等图拟合方法，使用帕多瓦等时线生成模型来测量SFH，并确定了这十个矮星系的星体形成率、距离模数和金属丰度。结果表明，矮星不规则星系的星体形成率呈缓慢增长趋势，而矮椭圆星系的星体形成率从过去到现在呈缓慢下降趋势，同时表明NGC 6822的SFH显示出明显的增长特征，揭示了相互作用事件触发的星体形成活动。这些研究有助于我们更好地理解星系演化和恒星物理。 <div>
The star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies provide valuable insights into galaxy evolution and stellar physics. Understanding the SFHs enables the study of chemical enrichment of galaxies, star formation triggered by interactions, and the behavior of various stellar populations. This work investigates the SFHs of ten dwarf galaxies in the Local Group (LG), which spans a wide range of types, masses, luminosities, and metallicities. The analysis is based on our new sample of the member stars in the LG after removing foreground dwarf stars by using information from the near-infrared color–color diagram and Gaia astrometry. The sample includes the most complete and pure red supergiants and asymptotic giant branch stars to gain valuable insights into the recent SFHs of the galaxies. A fitting method based on the color–magnitude diagram (CMD) is introduced to measure the SFH. The Padova isochrones are used to generate initial model CMDs, accounting for photometric errors and completeness through star-field simulations to match the completeness and error distributions of the observed CMDs. Subsequently, the SFHs, distance modulus, and metallicity of the ten dwarf galaxies are determined by fitting the CMDs. The results indicate that the star formation rates of dwarf irregulars show a gradual increase, while those of dwarf ellipticals exhibit a gradual decrease from the past to the present. Furthermore, this work shows that the star formation activity in dwarf ellipticals persisted up to 30 Myr ago. A significant increasing feature in the SFH of NGC 6822 reveals star formation activity triggered by an interaction event.

Stellar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from host stars are an important factor that affects the habitability of exoplanets. Although their solar counterparts have been well observed for decades, it is still very difficult to find solid evidence of stellar CMEs. Using the spectral line profile asymmetry caused by the Doppler shift of erupting plasma, several stellar CME candidates have been identified from spectral lines formed at chromospheric or transition region temperatures of the stars. However, a successful detection of stellar CME signals based on the profile asymmetries of coronal lines is still lacking. It is unclear whether we can detect such signals. Here we construct an analytical model for CMEs on solar-type stars and derive an expression of stellar extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) line profiles during CME eruptions. For different instrumental parameters, exposure times, CME propagation directions, and stellar activity levels, we synthesized the corresponding line profiles of Fe ixλ171.07 and Fe xvλ284.16. Further investigations provide constraints on the instrumental requirements for successful detection and characterization of stellar CMEs. Our results show that it is possible to detect stellar CME signals and infer their velocities based on spectral profile asymmetries using an EUV spectrometer with a moderate spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Our work provides important references for the design of future EUV spectrometers for stellar CME detection and the development of observation strategies.

Galactic and extragalactic objects in the Universe are sources of high-energy neutrinos that may contribute to the astrophysical neutrino signal seen by IceCube. Recently, a study done using cascade-like events seen by IceCube reported neutrino emission from the Galactic plane with >4σ significance. In this work, we put a lower limit on the number of Galactic sources required to explain this emission. To achieve this, we use a simulation package created to simulate point sources in the Galaxy along with the neutrino and gamma-ray flux emissions originating from them. Along with using past IceCube discovery potential curves, we also account for Eddington bias effects due to Poisson fluctuations in the number of detected neutrino events. We present a toy Monte Carlo simulation to show that there must be at least eight sources, each with luminosity less than 1.6 × 1035 erg s−1, responsible for the Galactic neutrino emission. Our results constrain the number of individual point-like emission regions, which apply both to discrete astrophysical sources and to individual points of diffuse emission.

这篇文章研究了太阳耀斑和日冕物质抛射（CME）在传播过程中的非径向运动以及它们与太阳活动周期的关系。研究使用了来自数据中心的256个事件，并分析了它们在天空平面上纬度的比较。研究确认了CME在太阳源区向赤道方向的偏移，在太阳第25个太阳活动周期的上升阶段尤为明显。同时，研究还发现了CME的线速度与PE-CME纬度偏移之间的关系，主要在200和800km/s之间。另外，研究比较了第24个太阳活动周期的上升和衰退阶段的非径向偏移情况，发现在衰退阶段更多的事件偏向极地方向，这一变化归因于在衰退阶段存在大量低纬度的日冕空洞以及邻近活跃区的影响。
<br /><br />总结: <div>
During their propagation, coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and prominences sometimes display a nonradial motion. During the years after the solar minimum, the CME central position angle tended to be offset closer to the equator compared to that of the associated prominence eruptions (PE). No such effect was observed during solar maximum. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the latitudinal offsets of CMEs with respect to their source regions. We study 256 events from SC 24 and SC 25, listed in the Coordinate Data Analysis Workshop Data Center. We analyzed the CMES radial offset from the associated PEs by comparing their latitudes in the plane of the sky. This work is an extension of the previous work by Gopalswamy et al., but with an independent data set. We have confirmed the systematic equatorward offset of CME from the solar source region for the rising phase of Solar Cycle 25. Our analysis of the relation between CME linear speed and PE-CME latitudinal offset indicated that the velocities of the deflected CMEs are mainly in the range of 200 and 800 km s−1. In this study, we compared the nonradial offsets for the rising and decay phases of SC 24 and our analysis has shown that during the decay phase more events deflected toward the pole can be observed. The observed variation is attributed to the presence of a substantial number of low-latitude coronal holes during the decay phase and to the influence from nearby active regions.

The astrophysical origin of stellar-mass black hole (BH) mergers discovered through gravitational waves (GWs) is widely debated. Mergers in the disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) represent promising environments for at least a fraction of these events, with possible observational clues in the GW data. An additional clue to unveil AGN merger environments is provided by possible electromagnetic emission from postmerger accreting BHs. Associated with BH mergers in AGN disks, emission from shocks emerging around jets launched by accreting merger remnants is expected. Here we compute the properties of the emission produced during breakout and the subsequent adiabatic expansion phase of the shocks, and we then apply this model to optical flares suggested to be possibly associated with GW events. We find that the majority of the reported flares can be explained by breakout and shock cooling emission. If the optical flares are produced by shock cooling emission, they would display moderate color evolution, possibly color variations among different events, and a positive correlation between delay time and flare duration and would be preceded by breakout emission in X-rays. If the breakout emission dominates the observed lightcurve, we predict the color to be distributed in a narrow range in the optical band and the delay time from GW to electromagnetic emission to be longer than ∼2 days. Hence, further explorations of delay time distributions, flare color evolution, and associated X-ray emission will be useful to test the proposed emission model for the observed flares.

<div> 关键词: 太阳，磁拓扑，磁重连，太阳耀斑，日冕物质抛射

总结:
太阳表面的磁拓扑对太阳耀斑和日冕物质抛射的能量积累和释放起着关键作用。磁场的拓扑结构决定了电流片是否形成以及磁重连发生的位置。研究发现，具有嵌套双极点和两个零点的磁拓扑可以解释更复杂的动力学现象，如失败的喷发和日冕物质抛射与射流的相互作用。通过分析2013年7月13日在NOAA 11791活动区的事件，研究发现内部活跃区发生了喷发并伴随着耀斑，随后磁场发生重连。研究结果显示，内部零点和外部零点的重连差异自然地解释了观察到的弱射流和喷发的停滞现象。这些结果对于失败的太阳喷发有着一般性的启示。<br /><br /> <div>
The magnetic topology of erupting regions on the Sun is a key factor in the energy buildup and release, and the subsequent evolution of flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The presence/absence of null points and separatrices dictates whether and where current sheets form and magnetic reconnection occurs. Numerical simulations show that energy buildup and release via reconnection in the simplest configuration with a null, the embedded bipole, is a universal mechanism for solar eruptions. Here we demonstrate that a magnetic topology with nested bipoles and two nulls can account for more complex dynamics, such as failed eruptions and CME–jet interactions. We investigate the stalled eruption of a nested configuration on 2013 July 13 in NOAA Active Region 11791, in which a small bipole is embedded within a large transequatorial pseudo-streamer containing a null. In the studied event, the inner active region erupted, ejecting a small flux rope behind a shock accompanied by a flare; the flux rope then reconnected with pseudo-streamer flux and, rather than escaping intact, mainly distorted the pseudo-streamer null into a current sheet. EUV and coronagraph images revealed a weak shock and a faint collimated outflow from the pseudo-streamer. We analyzed Solar Dynamics Observatory and Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory observations and compared the inferred magnetic evolution and dynamics with three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulations of a simplified representation of this nested fan-spine system. The results suggest that the difference between breakout reconnection at the inner null and at the outer null naturally accounts for the observed weak jet and stalled ejection. We discuss the general implications of our results for failed eruptions.

JAGB恒星, 近红外色-星等图, 标准烛光, 距离模数, 哈勃常数。 
<br /><br />总结:
本研究在NGC 4258和四个Ia型超新星的宿主星系中研究了JAGB区域的恒星。这些恒星形成明显的团簇，可通过James Webb Space Telescope NIRCam光度测定。通过多种方法来确定JAGB的表观参考星等，发现了高达0.2等的差异。这些方法估算的恒星的明亮度差异似乎是固有的，并且由JAGB的光度函数的非均匀形状进一步放大。研究使用“多方法”来一致测量JAGB星等和通过NGC 4258校准的Ia型超新星宿主星系的距离模数。最后得出了哈勃常数的估计值。未来的工作将进一步标准化和改进JAGB方法，使其更具竞争力。 <div>
We study stars in the J-regions of the asymptotic giant branch (JAGB) of near-infrared color–magnitude diagrams in the maser host NGC 4258 and four hosts of six Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia): NGC 1448, NGC 1559, NGC 5584, and NGC 5643. These clumps of stars are readily apparent near 1.0 < F150W − F277W < 1.5 and mF150W = 22–25 mag with James Webb Space Telescope NIRCam photometry. Various methods have been proposed to assign an apparent reference magnitude to this recently proposed standard candle, including the mode, median, sigma-clipped mean, or a modeled luminosity function parameter. We test the consistency of these by measuring intrahost variations, finding differences of up to ∼0.2 mag that significantly exceed statistical uncertainties. Brightness differences appear intrinsic, and are further amplified by the nonuniform shape of the JAGB luminosity function, also apparent in the LMC and SMC. We follow a “many methods” approach to measure consistently JAGB magnitudes and distance moduli to the SN Ia host sample calibrated by NGC 4258. We find broad agreement with distance moduli measured from Cepheids, tip of the red giant branch, and Miras. However, the SN host mean distance modulus estimated via the JAGB method necessary to estimate H0 differs by ∼0.19 mag among the above definitions, the result of different levels of luminosity function asymmetry. The methods yield a full range of 71−78 km s−1 Mpc−1, i.e., a fiducial result of H0 = 74.7 ± 2.1(stat) ± 2.3(sys, ±3.1 if combined in quadrature) km s−1 Mpc−1, with systematic errors limited by the differences in methods. Future work may seek to standardize and refine this promising tool further, making it more competitive with established distance indicators.

The Omh2(zi, zj) two-point diagnostics was proposed as a litmus test of the ΛCDM model, and measurements of the cosmic expansion rate H(z) have been extensively used to perform this test. The results obtained so far suggested a tension between observations and predictions of the ΛCDM model. However, the data set of H(z) direct measurements from cosmic chronometers and baryon acoustic oscillations was quite limited. This motivated us to study the performance of this test on a larger sample obtained in an alternative way. In this paper, we propose that gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens could provide large samples of H(z) measurements in the redshift range of 0 < z < 5, based on the measurements of the dipole anisotropy of luminosity distance arising from the matter inhomogeneities of the large-scale structure and the local motion of the observer. We discuss the effectiveness of our method in the context of the space-borne DECi-herz Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory, based on a comprehensive H(z) simulated data set from binary neutron star merger systems. Our results indicate that in the GW domain, the Omh2(zi, zj) two-point diagnostics could effectively distinguish whether ΛCDM is the best description of our Universe. We also discuss the potential of our methodology in determining possible evidence for dark energy evolution, focusing on its performance on the constant and redshift-dependent dark energy equation of state.

<title>Large-scale Structures in COSMOS2020: Evolution of Star Formation Activity in Different Environments at 0.4 < z < 4</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To study the role of environment in galaxy evolution, we reconstruct the underlying density field of galaxies based on COSMOS2020 (The Farmer catalog) and provide the density catalog for a magnitude-limited (Ks < 24.5) sample of ∼210,000 galaxies at 0.4 < z < 5 within the COSMOS field. The environmental densities are calculated using a weighted kernel density estimation approach with the choice of a von Mises–Fisher kernel, an analog of the Gaussian kernel for periodic data. Additionally, we make corrections for the edge effect and masked regions in the field. We utilize physical properties extracted by LePhare to investigate the connection between star formation activity and the environmental density of galaxies in six mass-complete subsamples at different cosmic epochs within 0.4 < z < 4. Our findings confirm a strong anticorrelation between star formation rate (SFR)/specific SFR (sSFR) and environmental density out to z ∼ 1.1. At 1.1 < z < 2, there is no significant correlation between SFR/sSFR and density. At 2 < z < 4, we observe a reversal of the SFR/sSFR–density relation such that both SFR and sSFR increase by a factor of ∼10 with increasing density contrast, δ, from −0.4 to 5. This observed reversal at higher redshifts supports the scenario where an increased availability of gas supply, along with tidal interactions and a generally higher star formation efficiency in dense environments, could potentially enhance star formation activity in galaxies located in rich environments at z > 2.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The duration of orbital decay induced by gravitational waves (GWs) is often the bottleneck of the evolutionary phases going from star formation to a merger. We show here that kicks imparted to the newly born compact object during the second collapse generically result in a GW merger time distribution behaving like at short durations, leading to ultrafast mergers. Namely, a nonnegligible fraction of neutron star binaries, formed in this way, will merge on a timescale as short as 10 Myr, and a small fraction will merge even on a timescale less than 10 kyr. The results can be applied to different types of compact binaries. We discuss here the implications for binary neutron star mergers. These include unique short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), eccentric and misaligned mergers, r-process enrichment in the very early Universe and in highly star-forming regions, and possible radio precursors. Interestingly, we conclude that among the few hundred short GRBs detected so far, a few must have formed via this ultrafast channel.

<title>Solar Energetic Particle and the Heliospheric Current Sheet</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad33c2</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The effect of the heliospheric current sheet (HCS) on the propagation of solar energetic particles (SEPs) remains poorly known. In this study we address this question by surveying energetic (∼2.0–9.6 MeV nucleon–1) helium data acquired by the energetic particle acceleration, composition, and transport (EPACT) sensor on board the Wind spacecraft. A superposed epoch analysis of 319 HCS crossings made by Wind reveals a sharp drop in the SEP fluxes at the HCS for the low-energy channels and little change across the HCS for the high-energy channels. To help understand the statistical result, we studied a total of 15 SEP flux dropout (a decrease of ∼50% or more) events that coincided with the crossing of the HCS. One of the common features of these SEP events is that they were initiated in the western hemisphere but far away from the longitude of HCS crossings, suggesting that the source of SEPs was well connected initially but was cut off later after Wind moved to the opposite hemisphere (e.g., HCS crossing). Further analysis of the events suggests that the percentage of flux dropouts decreases with increasing energy. It is suggested that a strong scattering of MeV helium may have occurred as the particle gyroradius is comparable to the thickness of the current sheet. This study clearly provides solid evidence for the HCS as a barrier to suppressing SEP flux of MeV energies from the onset hemisphere to the other.

<title>Circumnuclear Multiphase Gas in the Circinus Galaxy. VI. Detectability of Molecular Inflow and Atomic Outflow</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent submillimeter observations have revealed signs of parsec-scale molecular inflow and atomic outflow in the nearest Seyfert 2 galaxy, the Circinus galaxy. To verify the gas kinematics suggested by these observations, we performed molecular and atomic line transfer calculations based on a physics-based 3D radiation-hydrodynamic model, which has been compared with multiwavelength observations in this paper series. The major-axis position–velocity diagram (PVD) of CO(3–2) reproduces the observed faint emission at the systemic velocity, and our calculations confirm that this component originates from failed winds falling back to the disk plane. The minor-axis PVD of [C i](3P1–3P0), when created using only the gas with positive radial velocities, presents a sign of blueshifted and redshifted offset peaks similar to those in the observation, suggesting that the observed peaks indeed originate from the outflow, but that the model may lack outflows as strong as those in the Circinus galaxy. Similar to the observed HCN(3–2), the similar dense-gas tracer HCO+(3–2) can exhibit nuclear spectra with inverse P-Cygni profiles with ∼0.5 pc beams, but the line shape is azimuthally dependent. The corresponding continuum absorbers are inflowing clumps at 5–10 pc from the center. To detect significant absorption with a high probability, the inclination must be fairly edge-on (≳85°), and the beam size must be small (≲1 pc). These results suggest that HCN or HCO+ and [C i] lines are effective for observing parsec-scale inflows and outflows, respectively.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Hobby–Eberly Telescope (HET) VIRUS Parallel Survey (HETVIPS) is a blind spectroscopic program that sparsely covers approximately two-thirds of the celestial sphere and consists of roughly 252 million fiber spectra. The spectra were taken in parallel mode with the Visible Integral-field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS) instrument when the HET was observing a primary target with other HET facility instruments. VIRUS can simultaneously obtain approximately 35,000 spectra covering 3470–5540 Å at a spectral resolution of ≈800. Although the vast majority of these spectra cover blank sky, we used the Pan-STARRS1 Data Release 2 Stacked Catalog to identify objects encompassed in the HETVIPS pointings and extract their spectra. This paper presents the first HETVIPS data release, containing 493,012 flux-calibrated spectra obtained through 2023 March 31, as well as a description of the data processing technique. Each of the object spectra were classified, resulting in a catalog of 74,196 galaxies, 4,087 quasars, 259,396 stars, and 154,543 unknown sources.

这篇文章提出了伽马射线暴脉冲产生的假设，即高度相对论性的射流横扫观察者的视线时会产生。作者假设轴对称的喷流配置，结合特殊相对论效应，产生了GRB脉冲的时间反转特性。快速喷流膨胀导致的曲率是观测到的脉冲不对称和硬到软演变的主要原因。喷流相对于视线的相对倾斜度解释了已知的GRB脉冲形态类型。作者探讨了两种情景：一种是刚性/半刚性喷流的横向移动，另一种是弹道喷流从一个横向移动的喷口喷出物质。基于其与标准发射机制的一致性，更倾向于弹道喷流模型。 
<br /><br />总结：本文提出伽马射线暴脉冲产生的假设，探讨了相对论性喷流和特殊相对论效应，以及GRB脉冲的形态类型和动力学演变。作者提出了两种情景，并更倾向于弹道喷流模型。 <div>
We propose that gamma-ray burst (GRB) pulses are produced when highly relativistic jets sweep across an observer’s line of sight. We hypothesize that axisymmetric jet profiles, coupled with special relativistic effects, produce the time-reversed properties of GRB pulses. Curvature resulting from rapid jet expansion is responsible for much of the observed pulse asymmetry and hard-to-soft evolution. The relative obliqueness with which the jet crosses the line of sight explains the known GRB pulse morphological types. We explore two scenarios: one in which a rigid/semirigid jet moves laterally and another in which a ballistic jet sprays material from a laterally moving nozzle. The ballistic jet model is favored based upon its consistency with standard emission mechanisms.

<div> Spitzer, IRAC, SMUVS, UltraVISTA, JWST
总结:
该研究对COSMOS领域的26个Spitzer/IRAC选择的源进行了表征，这些源在UltraVISTA DR5 H-和/或Ks波段图像中未被检测到，覆盖了94平方弧分钟。研究分析了JWST的深度多波段光度学数据，并通过SED拟合揭示了这些星系的性质。研究发现，大多数星系在JWST/NIRCam波段λ<2μm处被检测到，只有四个在更深的JWST图像中仍然是近红外波段的辐射漏出。结果表明，UltraVISTA的候选漏出源主要位于z>3，并且具有高尘埃消光，典型的颜色过剩E(B − V) = 0.5 ± 0.3和恒星质量。值得注意的是，约75%的源显示出观测光度和模拟连续SED之间的流量增强，可以归因于相应NIRCam波段的Hα发射。推导得到的(Hα+N [ii]+S [ii])静息等效宽度和Hα星形成速率(SFR)的数值分别为∼100-2200 Å和∼5-375 M⊙ yr−1。这些源在SFR-M*平面上的位置表明其中35%为星暴星系，40%为主序星系，其余25%位于星形成谷。样本中包括一个活跃星系核和六个亚毫米源，这是通过辅助X射线和亚毫米波段光度学数据揭示的。高尘埃消光结合Hα发射的流量增强解释了为什么这些源在Spitzer成像中相对较亮，却在ultradeep UltraVISTA近红外图像中无法识别。 <div>
We have characterized 26 Spitzer/IRAC-selected sources from the SMUVS program that are undetected in the UltraVISTA DR5 H- and/or Ks-band images, covering 94 arcmin2 of the COSMOS field, which have deep multiwavelength JWST photometry. We analyzed the JWST/NIRCam imaging from the PRIMER survey and ancillary HST data to reveal the properties of these galaxies from spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. We find that the majority of these galaxies are detected by NIRCam at λ < 2 μm, with only four remaining as near-infrared dropouts in the deeper JWST images. Our results indicate that the UltraVISTA dropouts candidates are primarily located at z > 3 and are characterized by high dust extinctions, with a typical color excess E(B − V) = 0.5 ± 0.3 and stellar mass . Remarkably, ∼75% of these sources show a flux enhancement between the observed photometry and modeled continuum SED that can be attributed to Hα emission in the corresponding NIRCam bands. The derived (Hα+ N [ii] + S [ii]) rest-frame equivalent widths and Hα star formation rates (SFRs) span values ∼100–2200 Å and ∼5–375 M⊙ yr−1, respectively. The locations of these sources on the SFR–M* plane indicate that 35% of them are starbursts, 40% are main-sequence galaxies, and the remaining 25% are located in the star formation valley. Our sample includes one active galactic nucleus and six submillimeter sources, as revealed from ancillary X-ray and submillimeter photometry. The high dust extinctions combined with the flux boosting from Hα emission explain why these sources are relatively bright Spitzer galaxies and yet unidentified in the ultradeep UltraVISTA near-infrared images.

The elemental abundances between strontium and silver (Z = 38–47) observed in the atmospheres of very metal-poor stars in the Galaxy may contain the fingerprint of the weak r-process and νp-process occurring in early core-collapse supernovae explosions. In this work, we combine various astrophysical conditions based on a steady-state model to cover the richness of the supernova ejecta in terms of entropy, expansion timescale, and electron fraction. The calculated abundances based on different combinations of conditions are compared with stellar observations, with the aim of constraining supernova ejecta conditions. We find that some conditions of the neutrino-driven outflows consistently reproduce the observed abundances of our sample. In addition, from the successful combinations, the neutron-rich trajectories better reproduce the observed abundances of Sr–Zr (Z = 38–40), while the proton-rich ones, Mo–Pd (Z = 42–47).

<div> 钙铝富集包裹体（CAIs），太阳系，氧同位素，铝同位素，岩石圈<br />
总结：<br />
CAIs是太阳系形成时期最古老的固体物质，它们在不经变质的球粒陨石中具有与太阳类似的氧同位素组成和较高的初始26Al/27Al比值。球粒陨石中CAIs的氧同位素异质性可能记录了CAI形成区域的气体氧同位素组成波动，以及岩石母天体中CAI矿物与水溶液发生的氧同位素交换。达尔·阿尔·加尼083的CO3.1球粒陨石中的一个CAI包裹体显示了氧同位素的不均匀性，并且经过研究发现，CAI中的铝镁同位素系统没有受到干扰。这表明CAI形成区域的气体氧同位素组成在注入和/或混合26Al之前发生了波动。同时，CAI的初生矿物未受到影响，但grossite和melilite的氧同位素出现了16O耗尽的现象，这可能是与小行星内部的流体发生了氧同位素交换。 <div>
Calcium, aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) are the oldest solids dated that formed in the solar system. Most CAIs in unmetamorphosed chondritic meteorites (chondrites; petrologic type ≤3.0) have uniform solar-like 16O-rich compositions (Δ17O ∼ −24‰) and a high initial 26Al/27Al ratio [(26Al/27Al)0] of ∼(4–5) × 10−5, consistent with their origin in a gas of approximately solar composition during a brief (<0.3 Ma) epoch at the earliest stage of our solar system. The nature of O-isotope heterogeneity in CAIs (Δ17O range from ∼−24 up to ∼+5‰) from weakly metamorphosed chondrites (petrologic type >3.0) remains an open issue. This heterogeneity could have recorded fluctuations of O-isotope composition of nebular gas in the CAI-forming region and/or postcrystallization O-isotope exchange of CAI minerals with aqueous fluids on the chondrite parent asteroids. To obtain insights into possible processes resulting in this heterogeneity, we investigated the mineralogy, rare-earth element abundances, and O- and Mg-isotope compositions of a CAI from the CO3.1 chondrite Dar al Gani 083. This concentrically zoned inclusion has a Zn-hercynite core surrounded by layers of (from core to edge) grossite, spinel, melilite, and Al-diopside. The various phases have heterogeneous Δ17O (from core to edge): −2.2 ± 0.6‰, −0.9 ± 2.1‰, −13.7 ± 2.1‰, −2.6 ± 2.3‰, and −22.6 ± 2.1‰, respectively. Magnesium-isotope compositions of grossite, spinel, melilite, and Al-diopside define an undisturbed internal Al–Mg isochron with (26Al/27Al)0 of (2.60 ± 0.29) × 10−6. We conclude that the variations in Δ17O of spinel and diopside recorded fluctuations in O-isotope composition of nebular gas in the CAI-forming region prior to injection and/or homogenization of 26Al at the canonical level. The 16O depletion of grossite and melilite resulted from O-isotope exchange with asteroidal fluid, which did not disturb Al–Mg isotope systematics of the CAI primary minerals.

总结: 通过使用MESA模拟密集的大质量双星系统，并采用贝叶斯方法与观测数据进行比较，研究了HD 5980 A&amp;B的形成。发现初始周期约为3天，随着质量损失而扩大到现今的约20天轨道，星体初始质量很高，推测可能由于增加的质量流失而形成。进一步模拟了星体的进化，发现它们可能演化为质量约为19-37太阳质量的黑洞，虽然无法通过引力波融合，但通过可能的第三和第四伴星的影响，系统可能迅速成为引力波源。 <div>
Chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) is a promising channel for forming massive binary black holes. The enigmatic, massive Wolf–Rayet binary HD 5980 A&amp;B has been proposed to have formed through this channel. We investigate this claim by comparing its observed parameters with CHE models. Using MESA, we simulate grids of close massive binaries, then use a Bayesian approach to compare them with the stars’ observed orbital period, masses, luminosities, and hydrogen surface abundances. The most probable models, given the observational data, have initial periods ∼3 days, widening to the present-day ∼20 days orbit as a result of mass loss—correspondingly, they have very high initial stellar masses (≳150 M⊙). We explore variations in stellar-wind mass loss and internal mixing efficiency, and find that models assuming enhanced mass loss are greatly favored to explain HD 5980, while enhanced mixing is only slightly favored over our fiducial assumptions. Our most probable models slightly underpredict the hydrogen surface abundances. Regardless of its prior history, this system is a likely binary black hole progenitor. We model its further evolution under our fiducial and enhanced wind assumptions, finding that both stars produce black holes with masses ∼19–37 M⊙. The projected final orbit is too wide to merge within a Hubble time through gravitational waves alone. However, the system is thought to be part of a 2+2 hierarchical multiple. We speculate that secular effects with the (possible) third and fourth companions may drive the system to promptly become a gravitational-wave source.

<div> 关键词: 活动星系核，光变曲线，DRW模型，CHAR模型，阻尼时间尺度

活动星系核（AGN）的UV/光学光变曲线通常用Damped Random Walk（DRW）模型来描述。然而，阻尼时间尺度，一个关键参数的物理解释仍不清楚。最近的观察表明，阻尼时间尺度对波长和吸积速率的依赖性较弱，与吸积盘理论明显不一致。在这项研究中，我们在Corona Heated Accretion disk Reprocessing（CHAR）模型的框架内研究了阻尼时间尺度，该模型描述了AGN的变化。我们发现CHAR模型可以重现Stone等人的190个源20年光变曲线的观测功率谱密度，还可以通过拟合模拟光变曲线来很好地恢复观测阻尼时间尺度及其对波长的微弱依赖性。我们进一步证明了这种微弱依赖性是由于光变曲线持续时间不足所造成的，这导致最佳拟合的阻尼时间尺度低于固有阻尼时间尺度。在排除了这种影响后，CHAR模型确实显示了阻尼时间尺度对辐射顶点亮度和固有波长的强烈依赖性。我们的结果凸显了AGN变化研究中对充分长的光变曲线需求，以及CHAR模型在这类研究中的重要应用。
<br /><br />总结: 本文研究了活动星系核光变曲线的特征，发现DRW模型对阻尼时间尺度的描述存在问题，提出了CHAR模型来描述AGN的变化过程。通过模拟光变曲线的拟合发现了DRW模型的局限性，并证明了CHAR模型对阻尼时间尺度的正确描述，强调了AGN变化研究中的重要性。 <div>
The UV/optical light curves of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are commonly described by the Damped Random Walk (DRW) model. However, the physical interpretation of the damping timescale, a key parameter in the DRW model, remains unclear. Particularly, recent observations indicate a weak dependence of the damping timescale upon both wavelength and accretion rate, clearly being inconsistent with the accretion-disk theory. In this study, we investigate the damping timescale in the framework of the Corona Heated Accretion disk Reprocessing (CHAR) model, a physical model that describes AGN variability. We find that while the CHAR model can reproduce the observed power spectral densities of the 20 yr light curves for 190 sources from Stone et al., the observed damping timescale, as well as its weak dependence on wavelength, can also be well recovered through fitting the mock light curves with DRW. We further demonstrate that such weak dependence is artificial due to the effect of inadequate durations of light curves, which leads to best-fitting damping timescales lower than the intrinsic ones. After eliminating this effect, the CHAR model indeed yields a strong dependence of the intrinsic damping timescale on the bolometric luminosity and rest-frame wavelength. Our results highlight the demand for sufficiently long light curves in AGN variability studies and important applications of the CHAR model in such studies.

The drag force experienced by astronomical objects moving through gaseous media (gas dynamical friction) plays a crucial role in their orbital evolution. Ostriker derived a formula for gas dynamical friction by linear analysis, and its validity has been confirmed through subsequent numerical simulations. However, the effect of gas accretion onto the objects on the dynamical friction is yet to be understood. In this study, we investigate the Mach number dependence of dynamical friction considering gas accretion through three-dimensional nested-grid simulations. We find that the net frictional force, determined by the sum of the gravitational force exerted by surrounding gas and momentum flux transferred by accreting gas, is independent of the resolution of simulations. Only the gas outside the Bondi–Hoyle–Lyttleton radius contributes to dynamical friction, because the gas inside this radius is eventually absorbed by the central object and returns the momentum obtained through the gravitational interaction with it. In the subsonic case, the front–back asymmetry induced by gas accretion leads to larger dynamical friction than predicted by the linear theory. Conversely, in the slightly supersonic case with a Mach number between 1 and 1.5, the nonlinear effect leads to a modification of the density distribution in a way that reduces the dynamical friction, compared with the linear theory. At a higher Mach number, the modification becomes insignificant and the dynamical friction can be estimated with the linear theory. We also provide a fitting formula for dynamical friction based on our simulations, which can be used in a variety of applications.

总结:
太阳上观察到了一个静态的色球丝状物质，在附近活跃区域发生了B9.7级耀斑后，开始出现运动。在此过程中，观察到了黑色和亮色的丝状物质开始出现旋转运动，最终整个丝状物质不仅升起，而且在爆发期间出现了双螺旋结构。通过磁场建模发现，磁重联导致了丝状物质的不稳定并爆发。这项研究显示出磁扭结在日冕物质爆发中的重要作用。 <div>
We investigate a quiescent filament that erupted on 2013 August 2; the eruption was observed in EUV and Hα by the Solar Dynamics Observatory and GONG. After a B9.7 flare in the nearby active region, the dark filament materials near its eastern footpoint start to move in the direction of eruption, and are followed by a counterclockwise rotation identified as the motion of a combination of dark and bright filament materials. Then the entire filament rises up and keeps rotating in a clockwise direction during the eruption. More interestingly, the filament exhibits an unusual two-helix structure near its western footpoint during the eruption, which indicates the existence of a highly twisted flux rope. This hypothesis is confirmed by magnetic field modeling using the flux rope insertion method. In the best-fit unstable model, the lower limits of the estimated maximum and average twist numbers of the erupting flux rope reach 7.5π and 4π, which suggests that kink instability plays an important role in the eruption. During these magnetically coupled sympathetic eruptions, the highly twisted filament under the western lobe of a pseudo-streamer-like structure becomes unstable and erupts due to the removal of confinement by magnetic reconnection at the overlying hyperbolic flux tube, which is initiated by the B9.7 flare in the nearby active region. The initial filament motion occurs at the more unstable eastern footpoint, where the surrounding fields are weaker and decrease with height more rapidly.

<div> AGNs, broadband photometric reverberation mapping, ZTF database, Hα time lags, black hole masses<br />
在这项研究中，我们扩大了样本到 Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) 数据库，选择了123个具有足够变化性和平滑光变曲线的1型活动星系核(AGNs)，对来自ZTF数据库的3537个z < 0.09的AGNs进行了观测。从中我们计算了23个具有先前光谱时滞映射(SRM)结果的Hα时滞，使用了ICCF-Cut，JAVELIN和χ^2等方法。我们得到的Hα时滞略大于Hβ时滞，这与先前的SRM结果和AGN宽线区域的理论模型一致。通过对比SRM和PRM时滞分布和减去的发射线光变曲线，我们发现，在选择具有两个标准的AGNs之后，结合ICCF-Cut，JAVELIN和χ^2方法提供了一种有效的方式来从宽带PRM中获得可靠的Hα时滞。这些技术可以被用来在未来的大型多时相光度天文勘测中估算大量AGNs的黑洞质量，比如空间遗产调查和近期即将进行的广域巡天望远镜调查。 <br /><br />总结: <br />扩大样本至ZTF数据库，筛选出123个AGNs进行研究；使用ICCF-Cut，JAVELIN和χ^2方法得到Hα时滞结果，与先前的SRM结果和AGN宽线区域的理论一致；这些技术对于估算大量AGNs的黑洞质量非常有效。 <div>
In our previous work on broadband photometric reverberation mapping (PRM), we proposed the interpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF)-Cut process to obtain the time lags of the Hα emission line from two broadband lightcurves via subtracting the continuum emission from the line band. Extending the work, we enlarge our sample to the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) database. We adopt two criteria to select 123 type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with sufficient variability and smooth light curves from 3537 AGNs at z < 0.09 with more than 100 epoch observations in the g and r bands from the ZTF database. We calculate the Hα time lags for 23 of them that have previous spectroscopic reverberation mapping (SRM) results using the ICCF-Cut, Just Another Vehicle for Estimating Lags In Nuclei (JAVELIN), and χ2 methods. Our obtained Hα time lags are slightly larger than the Hβ time lags, which is consistent with the previous SRM results and the theoretical model of the AGN broad-line region. The comparisons between the SRM and PRM lag distributions and between the subtracted emission line light curves indicate that after selecting AGNs with the two criteria, combining the ICCF-Cut, JAVELIN, and χ2 methods provides an efficient way to get the reliable Hα lags from the broadband PRM. Such techniques can be used to estimate the black hole masses of a large sample of AGNs in large multiepoch photometric sky surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time and the survey from the Wide Field Survey Telescope in the near future.

Brown dwarfs (BDs) in ultra-short-period orbits around white dwarfs (WDs) offer a unique opportunity to study the properties of tidally locked, fast-rotating (1–3 hr), and highly irradiated atmospheres. Here we present phase-resolved spectrophotometry of the WD–BD binary SDSS 1557, which is the fifth WD–BD binary in our six-object sample. Using the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 Near-infrared G141 instrument, the 1.1–1.7 μm phase curves show rotational modulations with semiamplitudes of 10.5% ± 0.1%. We observe a wavelength-dependent amplitude, with longer wavelengths producing larger amplitudes, while no wavelength-dependent phase shifts were identified. The phase-resolved extracted BD spectra exhibit steep slopes and are nearly featureless. A simple radiative energy redistribution atmospheric model re-creates the hemisphere-integrated brightness temperatures at three distinct phases and finds evidence for weak redistribution efficiency. Our model also predicts a higher inclination than previously published. We find that SDSS 1557B, the second most irradiated BD in our sample, is likely dominated by clouds on the nightside, whereas the featureless dayside spectrum is likely dominated by H− opacity and a temperature inversion, much like the other highly irradiated BD EPIC 2122B.

Large uncertainties in the determinations of the equation of state of dense stellar matter allow for the intriguing possibility that the bulk quark matter in beta equilibrium might be the true ground state of the matter at zero pressure. Also, quarks will form Cooper pairs very readily since the dominant interaction between quarks is attractive in some channels. As a result, quark matter will generically exhibit color superconductivity, with the favored pairing pattern at intermediately high densities being two-flavor pairing. In the light of several possible candidates for such self-bound quark stars, including the very low-mass central compact object in supernova remnant HESS J1731-347 reported recently, we carry out a one-field theoretic model, the Nambu–Jona–Lasinio model, to investigate the stability of the beta-stable two-flavor color superconducting (2SC) phase of quark matter, but find no physically allowed parameter space for the existence of 2SC quark stars.

<title>The Opposite Behaviors of Proton and Electron Temperatures in Relation to Solar Wind Magnetic Energy: Parker Solar Probe Observations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Solar wind heating is an outstanding issue that has been discussed for decades. Research on the connection between solar wind particle temperatures and turbulence may provide insight into this issue. Based on Parker Solar Probe observations, this paper investigates the properties of solar wind proton and electron temperatures in relation to turbulent magnetic energy, via the calculation of correlation coefficients (CCs) between particle temperatures and magnetic energy. The calculations are regulated by the spatial scale, plasma beta (β), and the angle between the solar wind velocity and background magnetic field, where the plasma beta is the ratio of plasma thermal to magnetic pressure. Results show that the correlation between proton temperature and magnetic energy is positive and can be strong with a CC exceeding 0.8. The strong correlation preferentially occurs at ion scales, with the wind velocity and background magnetic field quasi-perpendicular and over a wide beta range (β < 3.0). On the other hand, the correlation between electron temperature and magnetic energy is commonly negative, often with an intermediate or negligible CC, accordingly. The CC with an amplitude up to 0.8 can arise at larger scales with the wind velocity and background magnetic field quasi-(anti)parallel and in the low-beta case (β < 0.6). The implication of these findings on the physics of turbulent heating in the solar wind is discussed.

<title>Ion Heating by a Fast Magnetosonic Turbulence in the Solar Corona</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Observational data at heliocentric distances of tens of solar radii suggest that fast magnetosonic modes make up a considerable fraction of the solar wind fluctuations. Furthermore, this fraction appears to increase closer to the Sun. We carry out three-dimensional kinetic simulations with particle ions and fluid electrons to evaluate the proton and alpha-particle heating produced by the damping of the fast waves in the solar corona. Realistic parameters at 5 solar radii, including the fluctuation amplitude, are used. We show that, due to the cyclotron resonance, the alphas are heated preferentially perpendicularly to the magnetic field and much more strongly than the protons. The presence of the alpha particles alters the energy partition by reducing the heating of the protons. Nevertheless, the proton heating is sufficient to account for the solar wind acceleration.

James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have been demonstrated to be efficient in detecting multiple stellar populations in globular clusters (GCs) in the low-mass regime of M dwarfs. We present an overview, and first results, of different projects that can be explored by using the JWST observations gathered under program GO2560 for 47 Tucanae, the first program entirely devoted to the investigation of multiple populations in very-low-mass stars, which includes spectroscopic data for the faintest GC stars for which spectra are available. Our color–magnitude diagram (CMD) shows some substructures for ultracool stars, including gaps and breaks in slope. In particular, we observe both a gap and a minimum in the F322W2 luminosity function less than 1 mag apart, and discuss which it could be associated with the H-burning limit. We detect stars fainter than this minimum, very likely brown dwarfs. We corroborate the ubiquity of the multiple populations across different masses, from ∼0.1 M⊙ up to red giants (∼0.8 M⊙). The oxygen range inferred for the M dwarfs, both from the CMD and from the spectra of two M dwarfs associated with different populations, is similar to that observed for giants. We have not detected any difference between the fractions of stars in distinct populations across stellar masses ≳ 0.1 M⊙. This work demonstrates the JWST's capability in uncovering multiple populations within M dwarfs and illustrates the possibility to analyze very-low-mass stars in GCs approaching the H-burning limit and the brown-dwarf sequence.

总结:<br />
使用Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy上的upGREAT仪器，从Nessie星云中的一个明亮光解区域（PDR）拍摄了[C ii] 157.74微米和[O i] 63.18微米的线发射。与澳大利亚紧凑射电阵列数据的比较显示经典的PDR结构，从离子化气体到光解气体，再到分子气体的进展。气泡的PDR的[O i]线发射显示自吸收特征。在远红外明亮原恒星附近，[O i]和[C ii]都显示出在−18 km s−1的吸收特征，与无关的前景分子云速度相同。Meudon模型表明，被标准G0 = 1的星际辐射场外部照射的分子云表面可能产生这些过渡的吸收特征。位于Nessie丝状红外暗云被气泡冲击的明亮年轻恒星物体AGAL337.916-00.477与两个冲击示踪物质相关联，表明气泡与丝状物质相互作用引发了星的形成。 <div>
Using the upGREAT instrument on board the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, we imaged [C ii] 157.74 and [O i] 63.18 μm line emission from a bright photodissociation region (PDR) associated with an ionized bubble located in the Nessie Nebula, a filamentary infrared dark cloud. A comparison with Australia Telescope Compact Array data reveals a classic photodissociation region (PDR) structure, with a uniform progression from ionized gas, to photodissociated gas, and to molecular gas from the bubble’s interior to its exterior. [O i] line emission from the bubble’s PDR reveals self-absorption features. Toward a far-IR bright protostar, both [O i] and [C ii] show an absorption feature at a velocity of −18 km s−1, the same velocity as an unrelated foreground molecular cloud. Since the gas density in typical molecular clouds is well below the [O i] and [C ii] critical densities, the excitation temperatures for both lines are low (∼20 K). The Meudon models demonstrate that the surface of a molecular cloud, externally illuminated by a standard G0 = 1 interstellar radiation field, can produce absorption features in both transitions. Thus, the commonly observed [O i] and [C ii] self-absorption and absorption features plausibly arise from the subthermally excited, externally illuminated photodissociated envelopes of molecular clouds. The luminous young stellar object AGAL337.916-00.477, located precisely where the expanding bubble strikes the Nessie filament, is associated with two shock tracers: NH3 (3,3) maser emission and SiO 2−1 emission, indicating an interaction between the bubble and the filament. The interaction of the expanding bubble with its parental dense filament has triggered star formation.

磁场在宇宙中无处不在，对各种天体物理过程起着重要作用。热尘埃颗粒与磁场对齐的偏振被广泛用于测量在天空平面上投影的二维磁场，但其沿视线方向的分量还没有得到约束。本文介绍了一种利用热尘埃偏振和颗粒对齐物理推断三维磁场的新方法。首先，我们利用基于磁场增强辐射力矩对齐理论的现代颗粒对齐理论发展了热尘埃偏振的物理模型。然后，我们利用我们更新的POLARIS代码对具有丝状云的磁流体力学模拟的合成观测进行了测试。结合经过测试的物理偏振模型和合成偏振，我们展示了通过偏振度可以准确限制磁场的倾斜角。与真实的三维磁场相比，基于颗粒对齐物理的方法比假设均匀颗粒对齐的先前方法更准确。这种新技术为利用热尘埃偏振和颗粒对齐理论追踪三维磁场以及限制尘埃特性和颗粒对齐物理铺平了道路。<br /><br />总结: 磁场在宇宙中起着重要作用，新方法利用热尘埃偏振和颗粒对齐物理来推断三维磁场。物理模型和磁流体力学模拟证明了这一方法的有效性。相比之前的方法，新方法更准确。 <div>
Magnetic fields are ubiquitous in the Universe and are thought to play an important role in various astrophysical processes. Polarization of thermal emission from dust grains aligned with the magnetic field is widely used to measure the 2D magnetic field projected onto the plane of the sky, but its component along the line of sight is not yet constrained. Here, we introduce a new method to infer 3D magnetic fields using thermal dust polarization and grain alignment physics. We first develop a physical model of thermal dust polarization using the modern grain alignment theory based on the magnetically enhanced radiative torque alignment theory. We then test this model with synthetic observations of magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a filamentary cloud with our updated POLARIS code. Combining the tested physical polarization model with synthetic polarization, we show that the B-field inclination angles can be accurately constrained by the polarization degree from synthetic observations. Compared to the true 3D magnetic fields, our method based on grain alignment physics is more accurate than the previous methods that assume uniform grain alignment. This new technique paves the way for tracing 3D B-fields using thermal dust polarization and grain alignment theory and for constraining dust properties and grain alignment physics.

总结: <br />
磁通量的涌现对太阳磁现象至关重要。使用深度学习技术改善了信噪比，使得我们可以逐案例进行研究。我们发现涌现引起的流动在不同情况下有所不同，且在宁静的对流背景中频繁发生。我们的分析表明，超粒子尺度的对流流动和磁浮力对磁通量的上升影响减弱。与数值证据一致，我们推测小尺度的表面湍流和/或深层对流过程在推动磁通量涌现方面发挥了巨大作用。 <div>
Magnetic flux emergence from the convection zone into the photosphere and beyond is a critical component of the behavior of large-scale solar magnetism. Flux rarely emerges amid field-free areas at the surface, but when it does, the interaction between the magnetism and plasma flows can be reliably explored. Prior ensemble studies have identified weak flows forming near emergence locations, but the low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) required averaging over the entire data set, erasing information about variation across the sample. Here, we apply deep learning to achieve an improved S/N, enabling a case-by-case study. We find that these associated flows are dissimilar across instances of emergence and also occur frequently in the quiet convective background. Our analysis suggests the diminished influence of supergranular-scale convective flows and magnetic buoyancy on flux rise. Consistent with numerical evidence, we speculate that small-scale surface turbulence and/or deep convective processes play an outsized role in driving flux emergence.

The relationship between CME properties in the corona and their interplanetary counterparts is not well understood. Until recently, a wide spatial gap existed between the two regions, which prevented us from disentangling the spatial and temporal evolution of CMEs. NASA’s Parker Solar Probe (PSP) has imaged multiple CMEs since its launch in 2018, but these events either intercepted the spacecraft far from the corona or completely missed it. Here we describe one of the first CMEs observed simultaneously by remote sensing and in situ instruments, and compare the corresponding measured properties, such as orientation, cross section diameter, density, and speed. The CME encounter occurred on 2022 June 2, while PSP was around 14 solar radii from the Sun center. We reconstruct the CME with forward modeling and determine its morphology and kinematics. The reconstruction suggests that PSP misses the CME apex but encounters its flank. The encounter time matches the period when the PSP in situ measurements indicate the passage of a CME. We also reconstruct the flux rope diameter and orientation using the in situ magnetic field measurements. The results are consistent with the CME reconstruction from imaging data. The close agreement between remote sensing and in situ analyses suggests that discrepancies found in past studies are more likely associated with the CME temporal evolution. We also find that the magnetic field of the CME flank extrapolated to 1 au is well below the average solar wind background and likely indistinguishable from it. This point could explain past events where the CMEs' interplanetary counterparts were not identified.

这篇文章介绍了第二次NuSTAR和XMM-Newton对JWST北黄道极（NEP）时间域场（TDF）的观测。该调查对硬X射线数量进行了考量，并发现了一些高度遮蔽的源。此外，XMM-Newton观测提供了软X射线覆盖，并对NuSTAR检测到的源的可靠对应进行了更强有力的确认。总之，这项研究为我们对太空中的天体有了更全面的认识。<br /><br />总结: <br />这项研究利用NuSTAR和XMM-Newton对NEP-TDF进行了第二次观测。通过这次观测，我们获得了迄今为止对NuSTAR外星系调查最敏感的结果，并探测到了60个源。结果显示，约47%的NuSTAR检测到的源具有严重遮挡，而%的源是钔厚的。同时，XMM-Newton观测对可见和红外对应进行了更可靠的鉴定。 <div>
We present the second NuSTAR and XMM-Newton extragalactic survey of the JWST north ecliptic pole (NEP) time-domain field (TDF). The first NuSTAR NEP-TDF survey had 681 ks total exposure time executed in NuSTAR cycle 5 in 2019 and 2020. This second survey, acquired from 2020 to 2022 in cycle 6, adds 880 ks of NuSTAR exposure time. The overall NuSTAR NEP-TDF survey is the most sensitive NuSTAR extragalactic survey to date, and a total of 60 sources were detected above the 95% reliability threshold. We constrain the hard X-ray number counts, – , down to 1.7 × 10−14 erg cm−2 s−1 at 8–24 keV and detect an excess of hard X-ray sources at the faint end. About 47% of the NuSTAR-detected sources are heavily obscured (NH > 1023 cm−2), and % of the NuSTAR-detected sources are Compton-thick (NH > 1024 cm−2). These fractions are consistent with those measured in other NuSTAR surveys. Four sources presented >2σ variability in the 3 yr survey. In addition to NuSTAR, a total of 62 ks of XMM-Newton observations were taken during NuSTAR cycle 6. The XMM-Newton observations provide soft X-ray (0.5–10 keV) coverage in the same field and enable more robust identification of the visible and infrared counterparts of the NuSTAR-detected sources. A total of 286 soft X-ray sources were detected, out of which 214 XMM-Newton sources have secure counterparts from multiwavelength catalogs.

Luhman 16 AB是一个强烈变化的棕矮双星系统，通过长达1200小时的光度监测，发现其存在数小时至数百小时的±5%变化。研究表明，5小时（k=1波数）和2.5小时（k=2波数）的短周期旋转调制主导了10小时内的变化，而由k=1和k=2波组成的行星尺度波模型能够很好地拟合周期图和光变曲线。此外，通过简单的太阳系巨行星带状模型，提出了潮纹区带风速分布不同导致k=1和k=2波周期范围差异的假设。最后，发现Luhman 16 AB还表现出长周期±5%的变化，周期范围从15小时到100小时不等。这些结果与之前的3D大气模拟一致，表明纬度相关波和缓慢变化的大气特征可能存在于Luhman 16 AB大气中，并且对数百个自转周期的光变有重要贡献。 <div>
In this work, we present the longest photometric monitoring of up to 1200 hr of the strongly variable brown dwarf binaries Luhman 16 AB and provide evidence of ±5% variability on a timescale of several to hundreds of hours for this object. We show that short-period rotational modulation around 5 hr (k = 1 wavenumber) and 2.5 hr (k = 2 wavenumber) dominate the variability under 10 hr, where the planetary-scale wave model composed of k = 1 and k = 2 waves provides good fits to both the periodograms and light curve. In particular, models consisting of three to four sine waves could explain the variability of the light-curve durations up to 100 hr. We show that the relative range of the k = 2 periods is narrower compared to the k = 1 periods. Using simple models of zonal banding in solar system giants, we suggest that the difference in period range arises from the difference in wind-speed distribution at low and mid-to-high latitudes in the atmosphere. Last, we show that Luhman 16 AB also exhibits long-period ±5% variability, with periods ranging from 15 hr up to 100 hr over the longest monitoring of this object. Our results for the k = 1 and k = 2 waves and long-period evolution are consistent with previous 3D atmosphere simulations, demonstrating that both latitude-dependent waves and slow-varying atmospheric features are potentially present in Luhman 16 AB atmospheres and are a significant contribution to the light-curve modulation over hundreds of rotations.

<div> 关键词: Flare events, TESS data, polars, superflares, accretion behavior
总结: 本文通过对所有可用的2分钟Tess数据进行目测检查，共识别出185颗极小的恒星中的5颗出现了6次耀斑事件。所有耀斑的辐射能量均超过10^34爱尔格，其中值介于10^35爱尔格左右，因此属于超级耀斑。其中有两次耀斑之后出现了亮度增强，可能表明白矮星发生了由日冕物质抛射引起的吸积突发事件。对探测结果的完整性分析表明，极小恒星的耀斑活动与M型矮星非常相似，这表明白矮星的高磁场对极小恒星的磁活动影响不大。我们估计还有大约20-30颗极小恒星存在磁活跃的辅星，因此鼓励进一步开展对极小恒星耀斑的更深入搜索。 <br /><br /> <div>
Flare events are magnetic activities on the stellar surface, which can provide us with information about the accretion behavior and evolution of polars. In this paper, we search for flare events on polars from all the available 2 minute cadence TESS data through visual inspection, and identify six flare events on five flaring stars from 185 polars. All the flares have bolometric energies above 1034 erg, with a median of ∼1035 erg, so they are superflares. Among them, two flares are followed by a brightness enhancement, which may suggest an accretion burst on the white dwarf caused by a coronal mass ejection. A completeness analysis of the detections demonstrates that the flare activities on the low-mass red dwarfs of polars are very similar to those on M dwarfs, which indicates that the highly magnetic fields of the white dwarfs have no significant effect on the magnetic activities on polars. We estimate that another ∼20–30 polars include a magnetically active secondary star, and more intensive searching for flares on polars is encouraged in further work.

本研究利用CRPropa框架解决了3D宇宙射线输运方程，并测试了两种不同的源分布和五种不同的扩散张量各向异性，覆盖了有效地沿磁场线扩散到各向同性扩散的范围。研究发现，在测试的磁场配置中，扩散张量的各向异性接近各向同性情况，并偏好于中央分子区域内的三个点源。未来的任务将需要更详细的3D气体分布和磁场结构。 <div>
The very high energy (VHE) emission of the central molecular zone (CMZ) is rarely modeled in 3D. Most approaches describe the morphology in 1D or simplify the diffusion to the isotropic case. In this work, we show the impact of a realistic 3D magnetic field configuration and gas distribution on the VHE γ-ray distribution of the CMZ. We solve the 3D cosmic-ray transport equation with an anisotropic diffusion tensor using the approach of stochastic differential equations as implemented in the CRPropa framework. We test two different source distributions for five different anisotropies of the diffusion tensor, covering the range of effectively fieldline-parallel diffusion to isotropic diffusion. Within the tested magnetic field configuration, the anisotropy of the diffusion tensor is close to the isotropic case, and three point sources within the CMZ are favored. Future missions such as the upcoming CTA will reveal more small-scale structures that are not yet included in the model. Therefore, a more detailed 3D gas distribution and magnetic field structure will be needed.

[C ii] 157.74 μm是远红外波段中最明亮和研究最充分的发射线之一，产生于星系星际介质(ISM)中。研究发现，[C ii]与H2的转换率与金属丰度呈弱相关，大部分[C ii]来自具有约n∼ 10 cm−3的原子气体。此外，[C ii]的强度与恒星形成速率(SFR)呈正相关，这与观测结果一致。因此，在金属贫穷的环境中，[C ii]是一种良好的SFR追踪器。解析密集(ISM)的多孔结构至关重要，因为它主导了[C ii] 157.74 μm的辐射。与光学薄极限相比，我们发现[C ii]线只有在我们假定的气体表面密度下的超太阳金属丰度时才会变得边缘光学厚。 <br /><br />总结: [C ii] 157.74 μm是星系星际介质中很重要的发射线，其特性与金属丰度相关，可用作SFR追踪器，对解析ISM的结构十分重要。 <div>
The [C ii] 157.74 μm fine-structure transition is one of the brightest and most well-studied emission lines in the far-infrared, produced in the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies. We study its properties in subparsec-resolution hydrodynamical simulations for an ISM patch with gas surface density of Σg = 10 M⊙ pc−2, coupled with time-dependent chemistry, far-ultraviolet dust and gas shielding, star formation, photoionization and supernova feedback, and full line radiative transfer. We find a [C ii]-to-H2 conversion factor that scales weakly with metallicity , where is the normalized metallicity relative to solar. The majority of [C ii] originates from atomic gas with hydrogen number density n ∼ 10 cm−3. The [C ii] line intensity positively correlates with the star formation rate (SFR), with a normalization factor that scales linearly with metallicity. We find that this is broadly consistent with z ∼ 0 observations. As such, [C ii] is a good SFR tracer even in metal-poor environments where molecular lines might be undetectable. Resolving the clumpy structure of the dense (n = 10−103 cm−3) ISM is important, as it dominates [C ii] 157.74 μm emission. We compare our full radiative transfer computation with the optically thin limit and find that the [C ii] line becomes marginally optically thick only at supersolar metallicity for our assumed gas surface density.

Turbulence in highly magnetized plasma can be relativistic and induce an electric field comparable to the background magnetic field. Such a strong electric field can affect the emission process of nonthermal electrons. As the first step toward elucidating the emission process in relativistic turbulence, we study the radiation process of electrons in relativistic circularly polarized Alfvén waves. While the induced electric field boosts the average energy of low-energy electrons with a Larmor radius smaller than the wavelength, the emissivity for such electrons is suppressed because of the elongated gyromotion trajectory. The trajectory of high-energy electrons is shaken by the small-scale electric field, which enhances the emissivity. Since the effective Lorentz factor of E × B drift is in the circularly polarized Alfvén waves, the deviation from the standard synchrotron emission is not so prominent. However, a power-law energy injection in the waves can produce a concave photon spectrum, which is similar to the GeV extra component seen in GRB spectra. If the turbulence electric field is responsible for the GeV extra component in GRBs, the estimates of the typical electron energy and magnetic field should be largely altered.

<title>A Channel to Form Fast-spinning Black Hole–Neutron Star Binary Mergers as Multimessenger Sources. II. Accretion-induced Spin-up</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this work, we investigate an alternative channel for the formation of fast-spinning black hole–neutron star (BHNS) binaries, in which super-Eddington accretion is expected to occur in accreting BHs during the stable mass transfer phase within BH-stripped helium (BH–He-rich) star binary systems. We evolve intensive MESA grids of close-orbit BH–He-rich star systems to systematically explore the projected aligned spins of BHs in BHNS binaries, as well as the impact of different accretion limits on the tidal disruption probability and electromagnetic (EM) signature of BHNS mergers. Most of the BHs in BHNS mergers cannot be effectively spun up through accretion if the accretion rate is limited to , where is the standard Eddington accretion limit. In order to reach high spins (e.g., χBH ≳ 0.5), the BHs are required to be born less massive (e.g., ≲3.0 M⊙) in binary systems with initial periods of ≲0.2–0.3 days and accrete material at . However, even under this high accretion limit, ≳6 M⊙ BHs are typically challenging to significantly spin up and generate detectable associated EM signals. Our population simulations suggest that different accretion limits have a slight impact on the ratio of tidal disruption events. However, as the accretion limit increases, the EM counterparts from the cosmological BHNS population can become bright overall.

<title>The Sun Remains Relatively Refractory Depleted: Elemental Abundances for 17,412 Gaia RVS Solar Analogs and 50 Planet Hosts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The element abundances of stars, particularly the refractory elements (e.g., Fe, Si, and Mg), play an important role in connecting stars to their planets. Most Sun-like stars do not have refractory abundance measurements since obtaining a large sample of high-resolution spectra is difficult with oversubscribed observing resources. In this work we infer abundances for C, N, O, Na, Mn, Cr, Si, Fe, Ni, Mg, V, Ca, Ti, Al, and Y for solar analogs with Gaia Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) spectra (R = 11,200) using TheCannon, a data-driven method. We train a linear model on a reference set of 34 stars observed by Gaia RVS with precise abundances measured from previous high-resolution spectroscopic efforts (R > 30,000–110,000). We then apply this model to several thousand Gaia RVS solar analogs. This yields abundances with average upper limit precisions of 0.04–0.1 dex for 17,412 stars, 50 of which are identified planet (candidate) hosts. We subsequently test the relative refractory depletion of these stars with increasing element condensation temperature compared to the Sun. The Sun remains refractory depleted compared to other Sun-like stars regardless of our current knowledge of the planets they host. This is inconsistent with theories of various types of planets locking up or sequestering refractories. Furthermore, we find no significant abundance differences between identified close-in giant planet hosts, giant planet hosts, and terrestrial/small planet hosts with the rest of the sample within our precision limits. This work demonstrates the utility of data-driven learning for future exoplanet composition and demographics studies.

<title>Winds and Disk Turbulence Exert Equal Torques on Thick Magnetically Arrested Disks</title>

The conventional accretion disk lore is that magnetized turbulence is the principal angular momentum transport process that drives accretion. However, when dynamically important large-scale magnetic fields thread an accretion disk, they can produce mass and angular momentum outflows, known as winds, that also drive accretion. Yet, the relative importance of turbulent and wind-driven angular momentum transport is still poorly understood. To probe this question, we analyze a long-duration (1.2 × 105rg/c) simulation of a rapidly rotating (a = 0.9) black hole feeding from a thick (H/r ∼ 0.3), adiabatic, magnetically arrested disk (MAD), whose dynamically important magnetic field regulates mass inflow and drives both uncollimated and collimated outflows (i.e., winds and jets, respectively). By carefully disentangling the various angular momentum transport processes within the system, we demonstrate the novel result that disk winds and disk turbulence both extract roughly equal amounts of angular momentum from the disk. We find cumulative angular momentum and mass accretion outflow rates of and , respectively. This result suggests that understanding both turbulent and laminar stresses is key to understanding the evolution of systems where geometrically thick MADs can occur, such as the hard state of X-ray binaries, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei, some tidal disruption events, and possibly gamma-ray bursts.

<title>Deriving X-Ray Line Profiles for Massive-star Winds from Momentum-conserving Dynamical Working Surface Solutions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a general procedure for deriving a line-profile model for massive-star X-ray spectra that captures the dynamics of the wind more directly. The basis of the model is the analytic solution to the problem of variable jets in Herbig–Haro objects given by Cantó et al. In deriving our model, we generalize this jet solution to include flows with a prescribed nonzero acceleration for the context of radiatively driven winds. We provide example line profiles generated from our model for the case of sinusoidal velocity and mass-ejection variations. The example profiles show the expected shape of massive-star X-ray emission lines, as well as interesting but complicated trends with the model parameters. This establishes the possibility that observed X-rays could be a result of temporal variations seeded at the wind base, rather than purely generated intrinsically within the wind volume, and can be described via a quantitative language that connects with the physical attributes of those variations, consistently with the downstream momentum-conserving nature of radiatively cooled shocked radial flows.

<title>The Effect of Spatially Varying Collision Frequency on the Development of the Rayleigh–Taylor Instability</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3359</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3359</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Rayleigh–Taylor (RT) instability is ubiquitously observed, yet has traditionally been studied using ideal fluid models. Collisionality can vary strongly across the fluid interface, and previous work demonstrates the necessity of kinetic models to completely capture dynamics in certain collisional regimes. Where previous kinetic simulations used spatially and temporally constant collision frequency, this work presents five-dimensional (two spatial, three velocity dimensions) continuum-kinetic simulations of the RT instability using a more realistic spatially varying collision frequency. Three cases of collisional variation are explored for two Atwood numbers: low to intermediate, intermediate to high, and low to high. The low-to-intermediate case exhibits no RT instability growth, while the intermediate-to-high case is similar to a fluid-limit kinetic case with interface widening biased toward the lower-collisionality region. A novel contribution of this work is the low-to-high collisionality case that shows significantly altered instability growth through an upward movement of the interface and damped spike growth due to increased free-streaming particle diffusion in the lower region. Contributions to the energy flux from the non-Maxwellian portions of the distribution function are not accessible to fluid models and are greatest in magnitude in the spike and regions of low collisionality. Increasing the Atwood number results in greater RT instability growth and reduced upward interface movement. Deviation of the distribution function from Maxwellian is inversely proportional to collision frequency and concentrated around the fluid interface. The linear phase of RT instability growth is well described by theoretical linear growth rates accounting for viscosity and diffusion.

<title>Photocleavage of Aliphatic C–C Bonds in the Interstellar Medium</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Ultraviolet (UV) processing in the interstellar medium (ISM) induces the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. Aliphatics, including alkanes, are present in different interstellar environments, being prevalently formed in evolved stars; thus, the dehydrogenation by UV photoprocessing of alkanes plays an important role in the chemistry of the ISM, leading to the formation of unsaturated hydrocarbons and eventually to aromatics, the latter ubiquitously detected in the ISM. Here, through combined experimental results and ab initio calculations, we show that UV absorption (mainly at the Lyα emission line of hydrogen at 121.6 nm) promotes an alkane to an excited Rydberg state from where it evolves toward fragmentation, inducing the formation of olefinic C=C bonds, which are necessary precursors of aromatic hydrocarbons. We show that the photochemistry of aliphatics in the ISM does not primarily produce direct hydrogen elimination but preferential C–C photocleavage. Our results provide an efficient synthetic route for the formation of unsaturated aliphatics, including propene and dienes, and suggest that aromatics could be formed in dark clouds by a bottom-up mechanism involving molecular fragments produced by UV photoprocessing of aliphatics.

X-ray emission is an important tracer of stellar magnetic activity. We carried out a systematic correlation analysis for the X-ray luminosity , bolometric luminosity , and X-ray activity level /Lbol) versus the binary parameters including orbital period P, Rossby number RO, effective temperature Teff, metallicity [Fe/H], the surface gravity , stellar mass M, and radius R, by assembling a large sample of semi-detached (EB-type) binaries with X-ray emission (EBXs). The fact that both and change in accordance with indicates that X-ray emission originates from the convection zone, while is proportional to the convection zone area. We found that EBXs with main-sequence components exhibit an upward and then a downward trend in both the – and M– relations, which is different from the monotonically decreasing trend shown by EBXs containing sub-giant and giant components. The magnetic activity level is negatively correlated with and stellar mass. Based on the magnetic dynamo model, the variations in the size and thickness of the surface convection zones can explain the observed relations. EBXs with main-sequence components have a similar RO– relationship to that of the binaries in the clusters as Praesepe and Hyade. We compared the X-ray radiation properties of EBXs with those of the X-ray-emitting contact binaries and found that EBXs have broader value ranges for and /Lbol).

太阳丝状物动态研究对于理解它们的形成、演变和喷发具有重要意义，尤其对太空天气预警和预测至关重要。中国Hα太阳探测器（CHASE）上的Hα成像光谱仪（HIS）提供了对太阳全圆盘的Hα光谱观测数据，为系统地探索和分析丝状物的等离子体动态提供了机会。本文利用U-Net模型识别太阳丝状物，并实施通道和空间可靠跟踪算法进行自动化丝状物跟踪。此外，我们使用云模型反演丝状物的径向速度，并采用图论算法提取丝状物脊线，这有助于深化我们对丝状物动态的理解。有利的测试表现证实了我们方法的有效性，并将在后续的CHASE/HIS观测数据中进行丝状物特征和动态的统计分析。<br /><br />总结: 本文针对自动处理和分析太阳丝状物动态的问题，使用了U-Net模型识别丝状物、通道和空间可靠跟踪算法进行自动化跟踪、云模型反演速度以及图论算法提取丝状物脊线。通过有利的测试表现证实了方法的有效性，为进一步统计分析CHASE/HIS观测数据中的丝状物特征和动态提供了重要基础。 <div>
Studies on the dynamics of solar filaments have significant implications for understanding their formation, evolution, and eruption, which are of great importance for space weather warning and forecasting. The Hα Imaging Spectrograph (HIS) on board the recently launched Chinese Hα Solar Explorer (CHASE) can provide full-disk solar Hα spectroscopic observations, which bring us an opportunity to systematically explore and analyze the plasma dynamics of filaments. The dramatically increased observation data require automated processing and analysis, which are impossible if dealt with manually. In this paper, we utilize the U-Net model to identify filaments and implement the Channel and Spatial Reliability Tracking algorithm for automated filament tracking. In addition, we use the cloud model to invert the line-of-sight velocity of filaments and employ the graph theory algorithm to extract the filament spine, which can advance our understanding of the dynamics of filaments. The favorable test performance confirms the validity of our method, which will be implemented in the following statistical analyses of filament features and dynamics of CHASE/HIS observations.

总结: <br />
本研究分析了2009年3月23日05:50至06:30期间地球磁尾区域的等离子体流动涡度。通过对三颗近地卫星观测到的涡度不均匀分布情况进行分析，发现太阳风中的等离子体逐渐混入近地磁尾区。发现近地卫星观测到的流动涡度和磁偶极子的形成比中磁尾区的卫星观测早大约10分钟。进一步分析发现，涡度与磁场沿着的电流和能量传输之间存在关系，并且导致了电离层伪分裂极光。这表明流动涡度主要通过将质量和能量从太阳风传输到近磁尾区，然后向中磁尾区传播，并通过耗散其主要热能将其遇到的等离子体加热。这些结果揭示了在地磁活动较弱的情况下，在大空间尺度上等离子流涡度的质量混合、能量传输和耗散过程。 <div>
Plasma flow vorticity is ubiquitous in space and plays a key role in material mixing and energy transfer. The five THEMIS satellites orbiting in different regions of the terrestrial magnetotail provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the temporal–spatial evolution characteristics of a plasma flow vortex on large spatial scales. We present an analysis of the flow vorticity that occurred between 05:50 and 06:30 UT on 2009 March 23 during a quiet time of the terrestrial magnetotail. The uneven distributions of the density and temperature of the vortex observed by the three near-Earth satellites (THA, THD, and THE) indicate that the plasma in the solar wind gradually mixed into the near-Earth magnetotail through a series of nonequilibrium processes. Both the flow vortices and dipolarization observed by the three near-Earth satellites were about 10 minutes earlier than those observed by the two satellites (THB and THC) in the mid-magnetotail. Further analysis of the relationship between vorticity, field-aligned current, and energy transport reveals that the flow vortex interacted with the surrounding plasma during its tailward propagation. The field-aligned current related to the vorticity could only generate a pseudo-breakup of the aurora in the ionosphere. Thus, we speculate that this flow vortex mainly transports mass and energy from the solar wind to the near-magnetotail, propagates tailward to the mid-magnetotail, and heats the encountered plasma by dissipating its bulk flow and dominant thermal energy. These results shed light on the mass mixing, energy transport, and dissipation of the plasma flow vortex during quiet levels of geomagnetic activity on large spatial scales.

<div> 星际物质，ALMA，密度结构，SM1N，N6
<br />
这篇文章研究了位于Ophiuchus分子云中的密集星形成核SM1N和N6的密度和温度结构。他们利用辐射传输建模和模拟观测，分析了0.8、2和3毫米的多波段连续辐射。研究表明，SM1N最适合于具有高中心密度（n ∼ 10^8 cm−3）和内部过渡半径约为80-300天文单位的折断幂律或Plummer样式密度剖面。其自由落体时间仅为几×10^3年，排除了存在嵌入的第一静态核（FHSC）或原恒星的可能性。NH2D在SM1N内部可能受到了排除。非热速度分散从NH2D到N2H+和H2D+逐渐增加，可能追踪了在更高密度下的增加的（但仍处于亚音速）向心速度。在N6核区，他们确认了在0.8毫米连续辐射中发现的微弱嵌入式点源N6-mm。NH2D和N2D+避开了N6-mm，在100 au范围内，而H2D+在N6附近没有明显的检测。这些示踪剂的分布与年轻、温暖物体的加热一致。因此，N6-mm仍然是迄今为止发现的最佳FHSC候选体之一，尽管其观测（亚）毫米光度低于对FHSC的预测。 
<br /><br />总结: 本文通过ALMA对Ophiuchus分子云中的星形成核进行了研究。对SM1N进行了密度和温度结构的分析，结果表明它是一个动力学上不稳定的但仍然没有形成恒星的核。NH2D在高密度下可能受到排除。非热速度分散逐渐增加可能追踪了向心速度。对N6核区进行了确认，并发现N6-mm仍然是最佳的FHSC候选体之一。 <div>
We present new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) continuum and NH2D, N2D+, and H2D+ line emission at matched, ∼100 au resolution toward the dense star-forming cores SM1N and N6 within the Ophiuchus molecular cloud. We determine the density and temperature structure of SM1N based on radiative transfer modeling and simulated observations of the multiwavelength continuum emission at 0.8, 2, and 3 mm. We show that SM1N is best fit by either a broken power-law or Plummer-like density profile with high central densities (n ∼ 108 cm−3), and an inner transition radius of only ∼80–300 au. The free-fall time of the inner region is only a few ×103 yr. The continuum modeling rules out the presence of an embedded first hydrostatic core (FHSC) or protostar. SM1N is therefore a dynamically unstable but still starless core. We find that NH2D is likely depleted at high densities within SM1N. The nonthermal velocity dispersions increase from NH2D to N2H+ and H2D+, possibly tracing increasing (but still subsonic) infall speeds at higher densities as predicted by some models of starless core contraction. Toward N6, we confirm the previous ALMA detection of a faint, embedded point source (N6-mm) in 0.8 mm continuum emission. NH2D and N2D+ avoid N6-mm within ∼100 au, while H2D+ is not strongly detected toward N6. The distribution of these tracers is consistent with heating by a young, warm object. N6-mm thus remains one of the best candidate FHSCs detected so far, although its observed (sub)millimeter luminosity remains below predictions for FHSCs.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章使用了XMM-Newton反射光栅光谱仪对Cygnus X-1和GX 339-4方向的X射线双星漫射星际介质中的Fe L壳层消光进行了高分辨率光谱研究。研究发现铁氧化物可能是携带铁的尘埃颗粒的候选物质，但需要更精确的能量标度来验证。该研究提出了对铁氧化物进行新的绝对光吸收测量的需求。 <div>
We present a high-resolution spectral study of Fe L-shell extinction by the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) in the direction of the X-ray binaries Cygnus X-1 and GX 339–4, using the XMM-Newton reflection grating spectrometer. The majority of interstellar Fe is suspected to condense into dust grains in the diffuse ISM, but the compounds formed from this process are unknown. Here, we use the laboratory cross sections from Kortright & Kim (2000) and Lee et al. (2005) to model the absorption and scattering profiles of metallic Fe, and the crystalline compounds fayalite (Fe2SiO4), ferrous sulfate (FeSO4), hematite (α-Fe2O3), and lepidocrocite (γ-FeOOH), which have oxidation states ranging from Fe0 to Fe3+. We find that the observed Fe L-shell features are systematically offset in energy from the laboratory measurements. An examination of over two dozen published measurements of Fe L-shell absorption finds a 1–2 eV scatter in energy positions of the L-shell features. Motivated by this, we fit for the best energy-scale shift simultaneously with the fine structure of the Fe L-shell extinction cross sections. Hematite and lepidocrocite provide the best fits (≈ + 1.1 eV shift), followed by fayalite (≈ + 1.8 eV shift). However, fayalite is disfavored, based on the implied abundances and knowledge of ISM silicates gained by infrared astronomical observations and meteoritic studies. We conclude that iron oxides in the Fe3+ oxidation state are good candidates for Fe-bearing dust. To verify this, new absolute photoabsorption measurements are needed on an energy scale accurate to better than 0.2 eV.

Thermal microwave emissions detected from stellar atmospheres contain information on stellar activity. However, even for the Sun, the relationship between multifrequency microwave data and other activity indices remains unclear. We investigated the relationships among the thermal microwave fluxes with 1, 2, 3.75, and 9.4 GHz, their circular polarizations, and several activity indices recorded during recent solar cycles and observed that these relationships can be categorized into two groups. In the first group, the relationship between the microwave fluxes and solar indices, which are strongly related to the active regions, can be well-fitted by using a linear function. In the second group, the fitting function is dependent on frequency. Specifically, the microwave fluxes at 1 and 2 GHz can be well-fitted to the total unsigned magnetic and extreme ultraviolet fluxes by employing a power-law function. The trend changes around 3.75 GHz, and the trend for the 9.4 GHz fluxes can be fitted by using a linear function. For the first time, we present the relationship between circular polarization and solar indices. Moreover, we extrapolated these relationships of the solar microwave fluxes to higher values and compared them with the solar-type stars. We found that ϵ Eri, whose microwave emission originates from thermal plasma, follows the extrapolated relationship. However, to date, only one star’s emission at 1–10 GHz has been confirmed as thermal emission. More solar-type stars should be observed with future radio interferometers to confirm that relationships based on solar data can be applied to stellar microwave data.

We present an analysis of the ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) and star formation rate density of distant galaxies (7.5 < z < 13.5) in the “blank” fields of the Prime Extragalactic Areas for Reionization and Lensing Science (PEARLS) survey combined with Early Release Science data from the CEERS, GLASS, and NGDEEP surveys/fields and the first data release of JADES. We use strict quality cuts on EAZY photometric redshifts to obtain a reliable selection and characterization of high-redshift (z > 6.5) galaxies from a consistently processed set of deep, near-infrared imaging. Within an area of 180 arcmin2, we identify 1046 candidate galaxies at redshifts z > 6.5 and we use this sample to study the UV LF in four redshift bins between 7.5 < z < 13.5. The measured number density of galaxies at z = 8 and z = 9 matches those of past observations undertaken by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Our z = 10.5 measurements lie between early James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) results and past HST results, indicating cosmic variance may be the cause of previous high density measurements. However, the number densities of UV-luminous galaxies at z = 12.5 are high compared to predictions from simulations. When examining the star formation rate density of galaxies at this period, our observations are still largely consistent with a constant star formation efficiency, are slightly lower than previous early estimations using JWST, and support galaxy driven reionization at z ≤ 8.

Some physical processes that occur during a star's main-sequence evolution also affect its post-main-sequence evolution. It is well known that stars with masses above approximately 1.1 M⊙ have well-mixed convective cores on the main sequence; however, the structure of the star in the neighborhood of the convective core regions is currently underconstrained. We use asteroseismology to study the properties of the stellar core, in particular convective boundary mixing through convective overshoot, in such intermediate-mass stars. These core regions are poorly constrained by the acoustic (p) mode oscillations observed for cool main-sequence stars. Consequently, we seek fossil signatures of main-sequence core properties during the subgiant and early first-ascent red giant phases of evolution. During these stages of stellar evolution, modes of mixed character that sample the deep interior can be observed. These modes sample the parts of the stars that are affected by the main-sequence structure of these regions. We model the global and near-core properties of 62 subgiant and early first-ascent red giant branch stars observed by the Kepler, K2, and TESS space missions. We find that the effective overshoot parameter, αov,eff, increases from M = 1.0 M⊙ to M = 1.2 M⊙ before flattening out, although we note that the relationship between αov,eff and mass will depend on the incorporated modeling choices of internal physics and nuclear reaction network. We also situate these results within existing studies of main-sequence convective core boundaries.

Pulsar timing arrays have found evidence for a low-frequency gravitational-wave background (GWB). Assuming that the GWB is produced by supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), the next gravitational-wave (GW) signals astronomers anticipate are continuous waves (CWs) from single SMBHBs and their associated GWB anisotropy. The prospects for detecting CWs and anisotropy are highly dependent on the astrophysics of SMBHB populations. Thus, information from single sources can break degeneracies in astrophysical models and place much more stringent constraints than the GWB alone. We simulate and evolve SMBHB populations, model their GWs, and calculate their anisotropy and detectability. We investigate how varying components of our semianalytic model, including the galaxy stellar mass function, the SMBH–host galaxy relation (MBH–Mbulge), and the binary evolution prescription, impact the expected detections. The CW occurrence rate is greatest for few total binaries, high SMBHB masses, large scatter in MBH–Mbulge, and long hardening times. The occurrence rate depends most on the binary evolution parameters, implying that CWs offer a novel avenue to probe binary evolution. The most detectable CW sources are in the lowest frequency bin for a 16.03 yr PTA, have masses from ∼109 to 1010 M⊙, and are ∼1 Gpc away. The level of anisotropy increases with frequency, with the angular power spectrum over multipole modes ℓ varying in low-frequency Cℓ>0/C0 from ∼5 × 10−3 to ∼2 × 10−1, depending on the model; typical values are near current upper limits. Observing this anisotropy would support SMBHB models for the GWB over cosmological models, which tend to be isotropic.

<div> 关键词: 超新星爆炸, 辐射相, 星际介质, 三维模拟, 水动力学

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了超新星爆炸在辐射相中能量和动量的沉积，发现辐射相可以分为四个阶段：由压力驱动的推雪相，动量守恒的推雪相，冷物质从壳体背面涌入中心真空的内爆相以及最终形成中心致密过密的云相。内爆和云形成的时间尺度分别为几百千年到几百万年和几到约10百万年。这些经过高度化学丰富的云在形成后几百万年内即可变得庞大并具有自引力，为超新星诱发的星体和行星形成提供了新途径。 <div>
The deposition of energy and momentum by supernova explosions has been subject to numerous studies in the past few decades. However, while there has been some work that focused on the transition from the adiabatic to the radiative stage of a supernova remnant (SNR), the late radiative stage and merging with the interstellar medium (ISM) have received little attention. Here, we use three-dimensional, hydrodynamic simulations, focusing on the evolution of SNRs during the radiative phase, considering a wide range of physical explosion parameters ( and ). We find that the radiative phase can be subdivided in four stages: A pressure-driven snowplow phase, during which the hot overpressurized bubble gas is evacuated and pushed into the cold shell; a momentum-conserving snowplow phase that is accompanied by a broadening of the shell; an implosion phase where cold material from the back of the shell is flooding the central vacuum; and a final cloud phase, during which the imploding gas is settling as a central, compact overdensity. The launching timescale for the implosion ranges from a few 100 kyr to a few Myr, while the cloud formation timescale ranges from a few to about 10 Myr. The highly chemically enriched clouds can become massive (Mcl ∼ 103–104M⊙) and self-gravitating within a few Myr after their formation, providing an attractive, novel pathway for supernova-induced star and planet formation in the ISM.

该研究使用Fermi大面积望远镜的观测数据报告了对射电星系NGC 6251的延伸γ射线发射的检测。最大似然分析结果显示，在8.1σ的置信水平下，射电形态模板比点状源描述更好地适配了观测数据，而叶片的贡献占总γ射线流量的50%以上。此外，γ射线能谱显示了核区和叶片区形状上的显著差异，核区呈现出曲线对数抛物线形状，而叶片呈现出幂律形式。长期γ射线光变曲线显示，核区和西北叶片区均未出现显著的通量变化。核区和西北叶片区的宽频谱能量分布可以用单区域轻子模型解释。核区的γ射线是由于同步辐射-自康普顿过程，而西北叶片区的γ射线被解释为宇宙背景辐射的逆康普顿发射。

1. 使用Fermi大面积望远镜数据检测到NGC 6251的延伸γ射线发射
2. 射电形态模板适配观测数据优于点状源描述
3. γ射线能谱显示核区和叶片区形状上的显著差异

We report the detection of extended γ-ray emission from lobes in the radio galaxy NGC 6251 using observation data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. The maximum likelihood analysis results show that a radio morphology template provides a better fit than a pointlike source description for the observational data at a confidence level of 8.1σ, and the contribution of lobes constitutes more than 50% of the total γ-ray flux. Furthermore, the γ-ray energy spectra show a significant disparity in shape between the core and lobe regions, with a curved log-parabola shape observed in the core region and a power-law form observed in the lobes. Neither the core region nor the northwest (NW) lobe displays significant flux variations in the long-term γ-ray light curves. The broadband spectral energy distributions of the core region and the NW lobe can be explained with a single-zone leptonic model. The γ-rays of the core region are due to the synchrotron-self-Compton process, while the γ-rays from the NW lobe are interpreted as inverse Compton emission of the cosmic microwave background.

<br /><br />总结: 本研究利用Nobeyama 45米射电望远镜对流向年轻恒星物体Per-emb-2的流体中的碳链物质（HC3N、HC5N、CCH和CCS）进行了观测，发现了直径约0.04 pc的高密度、低温度的北部储集区，该区域与流体相连，并且在化学特性上较为年轻。研究还估算出了流体可获得的总质量，并推测了其寿命。结果表明，流体的质量通过储集区的输送会持续到Class I阶段的结束，可能对原恒星系统产生化学组成的影响。 <div>
Streamers bring gas from outer regions to protostellar systems and could change the chemical composition around protostars and protoplanetary disks. We have carried out mapping observations of carbon-chain species (HC3N, HC5N, CCH, and CCS) in the 3 mm and 7 mm bands toward the streamer flowing to the Class 0 young stellar object (YSO) Per-emb-2 with the Nobeyama 45 m radio telescope. A region with a diameter of ∼0.04 pc is located to the north at a distance of ∼20,500 au from the YSO. The streamer connects to this northern region, which is its origin. The reservoir has high density and low temperature ( cm−3, Tkin = 10 K), which are similar to those of early-stage starless cores. By comparison of the observed abundance ratios of CCS/HC3N to the chemical simulations, the reservoir and streamer are found to be chemically young. The total mass available for the streamer is derived to be 24–34 M⊙. It has been estimated that, if all of the gas in the reservoir were to accrete onto the Per-emb-2 protostellar system, the lifetime of the streamer would be (1.1–3.2) × 105 yr, suggesting that the mass accretion via the streamer would continue until the end of the Class I stage.

<title>Assessment of SDSS-derived Galaxy Morphologies Using HST Imaging</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) was foundational to the study of galaxy evolution, having revealed the bimodality of galaxies and the relationship between their structure and star-forming activity. However, ground-based optical surveys like SDSS are limited in resolution and depth, which may lead to biases or poor quality in the derived morphological properties, potentially impacting our understanding of how and why galaxies cease their star formation (quench). We use archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of ∼2000 SDSS objects to assess the reliability of SDSS-derived morphologies, taking advantage of both SDSS statistical samples and HST’s superior resolution and sensitivity. Single Sérsic fitting and bulge-disk decomposition is performed on HST images for direct comparison with SDSS results. Of the three catalogs of SDSS-derived morphologies considered, none is significantly more accurate or precise than the others. For disk-dominated galaxies (n < 2.5), global Sérsic indices (n) from Meert et al. (hereafter, M15) are preferred. For bulge-dominated galaxies (n > 2.5), Simard et al. (hereafter, S11) and M15 overestimate n by ∼20%, and derived global n from Blanton et al. are preferred. We provide an empirical relation to correct S11 global Sérsic indices. Global Reff from S11 overestimates Reff for the largest galaxies by 0.1 dex. Despite these moderate biases, SDSS-derived single-component parameters are generally significantly more robust than SDSS-derived two-component parameters. The bulge Sérsic index (nbulge) cannot be reliably constrained from SDSS imaging at all, whereas the bulge-to-total (B/T) ratio can be inferred from SDSS (provided that nbulge = 4 is enforced) but has a large random error of ∼0.2.

<title>Formation of Polar Crown Filament Magnetic Fields by Supergranular Helicity Injection</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3352</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To understand the magnetic fields of the polar crown filaments (PCFs) at high latitudes near polar regions of the Sun, we perform magnetofrictional numerical simulations on the long-term magnetic evolution of bipolar fields with roughly east–west polarity inversion lines (PILs) in a 3D spherical wedge domain near polar regions. The Coriolis-effect-induced vortical motions at the boundaries of several supergranular cells inject magnetic helicity from the photospheric boundary into the solar atmosphere. Supergranular-scale helicity injection, transfer, and condensation produce strongly sheared magnetic fields. Magnetic reconnections at footpoints of the sheared fields produce magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) with helicity signs consistent with the observed hemispheric helicity rule. The cross-sectional area of MFRs exhibits an uneven distribution, resembling a “foot-node-foot” periodic configuration. Experiments with different tilt directions of PILs indicate that the PCFs preferably form along PILs with the western end close to the polar region. The bending of PILs caused by supergranular flows, forming S-shape (Z-shape) PIL segments, promotes the formation of dextral (sinistral) MFRs. The realistic magnetic models we obtained can serve as starting points for the study of the plasma formation and eruption of PCFs.

<title>White Dwarf Merger Remnants: The DAQ Subclass</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Four years after the discovery of a unique DAQ white dwarf with a hydrogen-dominated and carbon-rich atmosphere, we report the discovery of four new DAQ white dwarfs, including two that were not recognized properly in the literature. We find all five DAQs in a relatively narrow mass and temperature range of M = 1.14–1.19 M⊙ and Teff = 13,000–17,000 K. In addition, at least two show photometric variations due to rapid rotation with ≈10 minute periods. All five are also kinematically old, but appear photometrically young, with estimated cooling ages of about 1 Gyr based on standard cooling tracks, and their masses are roughly twice the mass of the most common white dwarfs in the solar neighborhood. These characteristics are smoking gun signatures of white dwarf merger remnants. Comparing the DAQ sample with warm DQ white dwarfs, we demonstrate that there is a range of hydrogen abundances among the warm DQ population and that the distinction between DAQ and warm DQ white dwarfs is superficial. We discuss the potential evolutionary channels for the emergence of the DAQ subclass, suggesting that DAQ white dwarfs are trapped on the crystallization sequence and may remain there for a significant fraction of the Hubble time.

<title>Shell-type Tidal Features Are More Frequently Detected in Slowly Rotating Early-type Galaxies than Stream- and Tail-type Features</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To enhance our understanding of the impact of galaxy mergers on the kinematics of early-type galaxies (ETGs), we examine differences in specific stellar angular momentum within the half-light radius ( ) among ETGs with different types of tidal features and those without such features. This is accomplished by categorizing tidal features, which serve as direct evidence of recent mergers, into shells, streams, and tails, through deep images from the DESI Legacy Survey, and by using MaNGA data for the analysis of the kinematics of 1244 ETGs at z < 0.055. We find that ETGs with tidal features typically have reduced values that are lower by 0.12 dex than ETGs without tidal features. ETGs with shells contribute most to the reduction in . Consequently, nearly half of ETGs with shells are classified as slow rotators, a fraction that is more than twice as high as that of ETGs with tails or streams, and over three times higher than that of ETGs without tidal features. These trends generally remain valid even when ETGs are divided into several mass bins. Our findings support the idea that radial mergers, which are more effective at reducing than circular mergers, are more closely associated with the formation of shells rather than streams or tails. The detection of shells in slightly more massive ETGs compared to streams and tails may be attributed to the fact that massive satellite galaxies are more likely to be accreted through radial orbits, due to the nature of dynamical friction.

<title>Constraining Protoplanetary Disk Winds from Forbidden Line Profiles with Simulation-based Inference</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Protoplanetary disks (PPDs) are sites of vigorous hydrodynamic processes, such as accretion and outflows, and ultimately establish the conditions for the formation of planets. The properties of disk outflows are often inferred through the analysis of forbidden emission lines. These lines contain multiple overlapping components, tracing different emission regions with different processes that excite them: a high-velocity component (tracing a jet), a broad low-velocity component (LVC; tracing inner disk wind), and a narrow LVC (tracing the outer disk wind). They are also heavily contaminated by background spectral features. All of these challenges call into question the traditional approach of fitting Gaussian components to the line profiles and cloud the physical interpretation of those components. We introduce a novel statistical technique to analyze emission lines in PPDs. Simulation-based inference is a computationally efficient machine-learning technique that produces posterior distributions of the parameters (e.g., magnetic field, radiation sources, and geometry) of a representative wind model when given a spectrum without any prior assumption about line shapes (e.g., symmetry). In this pathfinder study, we demonstrate that this technique indeed accurately recovers the parameters from simulated spectra without noise and background. Future work will provide an analysis of the observed spectra.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We introduce a novel halo/galaxy matching technique between two cosmological simulations with different resolutions, which utilizes the positions and masses of halos along their subhalo merger tree. With this tool, we conduct a study of resolution biases through the galaxy-by-galaxy inspection of a pair of simulations that have the same simulation configuration but different mass resolutions, utilizing a suite of IllustrisTNG simulations to assess the impact on galaxy properties. We find that, with the subgrid physics model calibrated for TNG100-1, subhalos in TNG100-1 (high resolution) have ≲0.5 dex higher stellar masses than their counterparts in the TNG100-2 (low resolution). It is also discovered that the subhalos with Mgas ∼ 108.5M⊙ in TNG100-1 have ∼0.5 dex higher gas mass than those in TNG100-2. The mass profiles of the subhalos reveal that the dark matter masses of subhalos in TNG100-2 converge well with those from TNG100-1, except within 4 kpc of the resolution limit. The differences in stellar mass and hot gas mass are most pronounced in the central region. We exploit machine learning to build a correction mapping for the physical quantities of subhalos from low- to high-resolution simulations (TNG300-1 and TNG100-1), which enables us to find an efficient way to compile a high-resolution galaxy catalog even from a low-resolution simulation. Our tools can easily be applied to other large cosmological simulations, testing and mitigating the resolution biases of their numerical codes and subgrid physics models.

这项研究通过完全动力学的粒子在电磁场中的模拟，研究了在介质内等离子体环境中镜不稳定性的非线性阶段以及随后的哨声和离子回旋波的激发。当镜模式达到非线性振幅时，哨声和离子回旋波同时出现，具有次优的振幅，在磁场强度低的区域沿B(t)近似平行传播。研究表明，激发的根源是被困在具有损失锥形分布的镜模式中的电子和离子的压力各向异性。我们还观察到，离子回旋波在非线性阶段中起着调节离子压力各向异性的重要作用。研究认为，即使在高β条件下，哨声和离子回旋波在镜不稳定性的后期阶段也是一个伴随特征，因此在ICM等天体环境中有望存在。我们还讨论了我们的研究结果对ICM中无碰撞加热和湍流耗散的意义。 <div>
Electron cyclotron waves (whistlers) are commonly observed in plasmas near Earth and the solar wind. In the presence of nonlinear mirror modes, bursts of whistlers, usually called lion roars, have been observed within low magnetic field regions associated with these modes. In the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters, the excitation of the mirror instability is expected, but it is not yet clear whether electron and ion cyclotron (IC) waves can also be present under conditions where gas pressure dominates over magnetic pressure (high β). In this work, we perform fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of a plasma subject to a continuous amplification of the mean magnetic field B(t) to study the nonlinear stages of the mirror instability and the ensuing excitation of whistler and IC waves under ICM conditions. Once mirror modes reach nonlinear amplitudes, both whistler and IC waves start to emerge simultaneously, with subdominant amplitudes, propagating in low-B regions, quasi-parallel to B(t). We show that the underlying source of excitation is the pressure anisotropy of electrons and ions trapped in mirror modes with loss-cone-type distributions. We also observe that IC waves play an essential role in regulating the ion pressure anisotropy at nonlinear stages. We argue that whistler and IC waves are a concomitant feature at late stages of the mirror instability even at high β, and therefore, expected to be present in astrophysical environments like the ICM. We discuss the implications of our results for collisionless heating and dissipation of turbulence in the ICM.

Kinematically persistent planes (KPPs) of satellites are fixed sets of satellites co-orbiting around their host galaxy, whose orbital poles are conserved and clustered across long cosmic time intervals. They play the role of “skeletons,” ensuring the long-term durability of positional planes. We explore the physical processes behind their formation in terms of the dynamics of the local cosmic web (CW), characterized via the so-called Lagrangian volumes (LVs) built up around two zoom-in, cosmological hydro-simulations of Milky Way–mass disk galaxy + satellites systems, where three KPPs have been identified. By analyzing the LV deformations in terms of the reduced tensor of inertia (TOI), we find an outstanding alignment between the LV principal directions and the KPP satellites’ orbital poles. The most compressive local mass flows (along the eigenvector) are strong at early times, feeding the so-called -structure, while the smallest TOI axis rapidly decreases. The -structure collapse marks the end of this regime and is the timescale for the establishment of satellite orbital pole clustering when the Universe is ≲4 Gyr old. KPP protosatellites aligned with are those whose orbital poles are either aligned from early times or have been successfully bent at -structure collapse. KPP satellites associated with tend to have early trajectories already parallel to . We show that KPPs can arise as a result of the ΛCDM-predicted large-scale dynamics acting on particular sets of protosatellites, the same dynamics that shape the local CW environment.

Employing an indicator of a [O iv] 25.89 or [Ne v] 14.32 μm line to 12 μm AGN luminosity ratio, we find 17 buried AGN candidates that are [O iv]-weak (L[O IV]/L12,AGN ≤ −3.0) or [Ne v]-weak (L[Ne V]/L12,AGN ≤ −3.4) among 30 AGNs in local U/LIRGs. For the [O iv]-weak AGNs, we estimate their covering fractions of Compton-thick (CT; NH ≥ 1024 cm−2) material with an X-ray clumpy torus model to be on average. This value is consistent with the fraction of CT AGNs ( ) among the [O iv]-weak AGNs in U/LIRGs and much larger than that in Swift/Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) AGNs (23% ± 6%). The fraction of [O iv]-weak AGNs increases from (early) to (late mergers). Similar results are obtained with the [Ne v] line. The [O iv]- or [Ne v]-weak AGNs in late mergers show larger NH and Eddington ratios (λEdd) than those of the Swift/BAT AGNs, and the largest NH is ≳1025 cm−2 at , close to the effective Eddington limit for CT material. These suggest that (1) the circumnuclear material in buried AGNs is regulated by the radiation force from high-λEdd AGNs on the CT obscurers, and (2) their dense material with large (∼0.5 ± 0.1) in U/LIRGs is a likely cause of a unique structure of buried AGNs, whose amount of material may be maintained through merger-induced supply from their host galaxies.

<div> AGN, dwarf galaxies, outflows, blueshifted absorption, feedback
总结:
该研究探讨了矮星系中的活动星系核（AGN）对流的发现，并使用紫外线吸收特征跟踪了三个矮星系中的出流。在两个对象中确认了出流，第三个对象中也可能探测到了出流。其中一个对象的出流被归因于照射电离，表明在矮星系尺度上有影响。与类似星形成速率的源中的星爆驱动出流相比，该出流速度更快，动能输出更高，可能提供负反馈。此外，在两个对象中检测到He iiλ1640发射线，表明可能有高度电离的AGN风。这些发现为矮星系中的AGN反馈提供了证据。 <div>
While stellar processes are believed to be the main source of feedback in dwarf galaxies, the accumulating discoveries of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in dwarf galaxies over recent years arouse the interest to also consider AGN feedback in them. Fast, AGN-driven outflows, a major mechanism of AGN feedback, have indeed been discovered in dwarf galaxies and may be powerful enough to provide feedback to their dwarf hosts. In this paper, we search for outflows traced by the blueshifted ultraviolet absorption features in three dwarf galaxies with AGN from the sample examined in our previous ground-based study. We confirm outflows traced by blueshifted absorption features in two objects and tentatively detect an outflow in the third object. In one object where the outflow is clearly detected in multiple species, photoionization modeling suggests that this outflow is located ∼0.5 kpc from the AGN, implying a galactic-scale impact. This outflow is much faster and possesses a higher kinetic energy outflow rate than starburst-driven outflows in sources with similar star formation rates, and is likely energetic enough to provide negative feedback to its host galaxy as predicted by simulations. Much broader (∼4000 km s−1) absorption features are also discovered in this object, which may have the same origin as that of broad absorption lines in quasars. Additionally, strong He iiλ1640 emission is detected in both objects where the transition falls in the wavelength coverage and is consistent with an AGN origin. In one of these two objects, a blueshifted He iiλ1640 emission line is clearly detected, likely tracing a highly ionized AGN wind.

<div> 太阳、开放磁通量、太阳黑子、日冕孔、太阳活动区
总结:
本研究通过对2014年9月至10月期间太阳活动的演变进行综合分析，发现在这一时期观测到了显著的开放磁通量增加现象。我们首先发现了开放磁通量增加与太阳磁场的强关联，其皮尔逊相关系数达到了0.94。此外，我们还发现开放磁通量与太阳日冕孔的关联较好，尽管日冕孔仅包含了太阳总开放磁通量的14%至32%。然而，我们注意到开放磁通量的演变与日冕孔面积的演变并无关联。开放磁通量的暂时增加与太阳南极残留磁场的消失有关，这是由于几个月前大量活跃区的磁通向南极流动导致的。此外，我们的分析还暗示了开放磁通量增加与太阳第24个太阳活动周期中最大的活跃区的同时出现可能存在关联。通过这项研究，我们对2014年9月至10月期间观测到的开放磁通量强烈增加现象提供了深入的洞察。 <div>
Coronal holes are recognized as the primary sources of heliospheric open magnetic flux (OMF). However, a noticeable gap exists between in situ measured OMF and that derived from remote-sensing observations of the Sun. In this study, we investigate the OMF evolution and its connection to solar structures throughout 2014, with special emphasis on the period from September to October, where a sudden and significant OMF increase was reported. By deriving the OMF evolution at 1 au, modeling it at the source surface, and analyzing solar photospheric data, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the observed phenomenon. First, we establish a strong correlation between the OMF increase and the solar magnetic field derived from a potential-field source-surface model (ccPearson = 0.94). Moreover, we find a good correlation between the OMF and the open flux derived from solar coronal holes (ccPearson = 0.88), although the coronal holes only contain 14%–32% of the Sun’s total open flux. However, we note that while the OMF evolution correlates with coronal hole open flux, there is no correlation with the coronal hole area evolution (ccPearson = 0.0). The temporal increase in OMF correlates with the vanishing remnant magnetic field at the southern pole, caused by poleward flux circulations from the decay of numerous active regions months earlier. Additionally, our analysis suggests a potential link between the OMF enhancement and the concurrent emergence of the largest active region in solar cycle 24. In conclusion, our study provides insights into the strong increase in OMF observed during 2014 September–October.

<div> HOCS+, G+0.693-0.027, molecular cloud, column density, cosmic-ray ionization rates

在对G+0.693-0.027分子云进行超深的分子线谱观测中，首次在空间中探测到O-质子化的羰基硫化物（HOCS+）。通过对我们观测到的所有Ka=0跃迁的数据分析，得出了HOCS+的柱密度，并推导出相对于H2的分数丰度。与之相反的S-质子化异构体HSCO+未被探测到，并且我们得出其相对于H2的丰度上限。我们还对OCS和HOCS+的比值进行了研究，并发现了高值的宇宙射线电离率对于再现观测到的HOCS+丰度是必需的。此外，我们比较了不同星际环境中的O/S比率，并发现G+0.693-0.027是O/S比率最低的源。最后，我们观察到HOCO+/HOCS+的比率与其他O/S分子对的比率相一致，表明在这个云中S没有因大尺度冲击而明显流失，这与其他源不同，那些源中S的含量仍被困留在冰冷的尘埃颗粒上。


<br /><br />总结: 
1. 首次在G+0.693-0.027分子云中探测到O-质子化的羰基硫化物（HOCS+）。
2. 比较了HOCS+和HSCO+的丰度，并观察到高值的宇宙射线电离率对于再现观测到的HOCS+丰度是必需的。
3. 比较了不同星际环境中的O/S比率，发现G+0.693-0.027是O/S比率最低的源。
4. 观察到HOCO+/HOCS+的比率与其他O/S分子对的比率相一致。
5. 在G+0.693-0.027分子云中S没有因大尺度冲击而明显流失。 <div>
We present the first detection in space of O-protonated carbonyl sulfide (HOCS+), in the midst of an ultradeep molecular line survey toward the G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud. From the observation of all Ka = 0 transitions ranging from Jlo = 2 to Jlo = 13 of HOCS+ covered by our survey, we derive a column density of N = (9 ± 2) × 1012 cm−2, translating into a fractional abundance relative to H2 of ∼7 × 10−11. Conversely, the S-protonated HSCO+ isomer remains undetected, and we derive an upper limit to its abundance with respect to H2 of ≤3 × 10−11, a factor of ≥2.3 less abundant than HOCS+. We obtain an HOCS+/OCS ratio of ∼2.5 × 10−3, in good agreement with the prediction of astrochemical models. These models show that one of the main chemical routes to the interstellar formation of HOCS+ is likely the protonation of OCS, which appears to be more efficient at the oxygen end. Also, we find that high values of cosmic-ray ionization rates (10−15–10−14 s−1) are needed to reproduce the observed abundance of HOCS+. In addition, we compare the O/S ratio across different interstellar environments. G+0.693-0.027 appears as the source with the lowest O/S ratio. We find an HOCO+/HOCS+ ratio of ∼31, in accordance with other O/S molecular pairs detected toward this region and also close to the O/S solar value (∼37). This fact indicates that S is not significantly depleted within this cloud due to the action of large-scale shocks, unlike in other sources where S-bearing species remain trapped on icy dust grains.

<title>Detecting Gravitational Wave Bursts from Stellar-mass Binaries in the mHz Band</title>

<div> 关键词: gravitational wave sources, compact object binaries, burst-like signature, LISA detections, Milky Way<br />
总结: 本研究考察了引力波源在mHz频段产生爆发的可能性，并发现在本地宇宙中，mHz爆发源的数量可能会很大。研究估计，银河系中可能有3-45对爆发式双黑洞，并且在LISA任务期间可能会检测到约102-104次爆发。此外，研究发现爆发源的数量强烈依赖于它们的形成历史。如果某些地区在最近几百万年内形成了紧凑天体双星，爆发源的比例会显著提高。因此，mHz引力波爆发的检测不仅有助于区分不同的形成途径，还能帮助我们了解银河系不同地区的恒星形成历史。<br /><br /> <div>
The dynamical formation channels of gravitational wave (GW) sources typically involve a stage when the compact object binary source interacts with the environment, which may excite its eccentricity, yielding efficient GW emission. For the wide eccentric compact object binaries, the GW emission happens mostly near the pericenter passage, creating a unique, burst-like signature in the waveform. This work examines the possibility of stellar-mass bursting sources in the mHz band for future LISA detections. Because of their long lifetime (∼107 yr) and promising detectability, the number of mHz bursting sources can be large in the local Universe. For example, based on our estimates, there will be ∼3–45 bursting binary black holes in the Milky Way, with ∼102–104 bursts detected during the LISA mission. Moreover, we find that the number of bursting sources strongly depends on their formation history. If certain regions undergo active formation of compact object binaries in the recent few million years, there will be a significantly higher bursting source fraction. Thus, the detection of mHz GW bursts not only serves as a clue for distinguishing different formation channels, but also helps us understand the star formation history in different regions of the Milky Way.

<div> dark matter, galaxy clusters, spatial distribution, dynamical evolution, BCG+ICL

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了利用加权重叠系数（WOC）比较暗物质、成员星系、气体和星团内光（ICL）等组件之间的空间分布，以研究星系团的动力学演化。研究发现，在更放松的星系团中，气体和BCG+ICL与暗物质的分布非常相似，尤其是在主要合并期间。此外，BCG+ICL对星系团动力学状态的变化具有敏感性，并且可以通过缩放BCG+ICL的径向分布来近似恢复暗物质分布。研究还发现，在未放松的星系团中，包括最大的卫星星系与BCG+ICL分布可以增强暗物质追踪能力。因此，研究得出BCG+ICL分布是暗物质分布的有效示踪器，而空间分布的相似性可作为星系团动力学状态的有用探针。 <div>
One intriguing approach for studying the dynamical evolution of galaxy clusters is to compare the spatial distributions among various components such as dark matter, member galaxies, gas, and intracluster light (ICL). Utilizing the recently introduced weighted overlap coefficient (WOC), we analyze the spatial distributions of components within 174 galaxy clusters (Mtot > 5 × 1013M⊙, z = 0.625) at varying dynamical states in the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Horizon Run 5. We observe that the distributions of gas and the combination of ICL with the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) closely resembles the dark matter distribution, particularly in more relaxed clusters, characterized by the half-mass epoch. The similarity in spatial distribution between dark matter and BCG+ICL mimics the changes in the dynamical state of clusters during a major merger. Notably, at redshifts >1, BCG+ICL traced dark matter more accurately than the gas. Additionally, we examined the one-dimensional radial profiles of each component, which show that the BCG+ICL is a sensitive component revealing the dynamical state of clusters. We propose a new method that can approximately recover the dark matter profile by scaling the BCG+ICL radial profile. Furthermore, we find a recipe for tracing dark matter in unrelaxed clusters by including the most massive satellite galaxies together with the BCG+ICL distribution. Combining the BCG+ICL and the gas distribution enhances the dark matter tracing ability. Our results imply that the BCG+ICL distribution is an effective tracer for the dark matter distribution, and the similarity of the spatial distribution may be a useful probe of the dynamical state of a cluster.

<div> 加速过程，磁层高能电子，HILDCAA事件，太阳风，Van Allen Probe卫星

总结:
加速过程中，高能电子受HILDCAA事件影响，在L值为4.0-6.0的区域获得加速，这一过程发生在HILDCAA事件开始后2.9-3.4天，主要由磁层电磁合唱波与次暴注入的约100keV电子之间的波粒相互作用引起。随着HILDCAA和合唱波的持续时间越长，加速到更高能量的高能电子也越多，这种加速过程是一种自举机制。 <div>
Magnetospheric relativistic electrons are accelerated during substorms and strong convection events that occur during high-intensity long-duration continuous auroral electrojet activity (HILDCAA) events, associated with solar wind high-speed streams (coming from coronal holes). From an analysis of ∼2–20 MeV electrons at L ∼ 2–7 measured by the Van Allen Probe satellite, it is shown that ∼3.4–4.1 days long HILDCAA events are characterized by ∼7.2 MeV electron acceleration in the L ∼ 4.0–6.0 region, which occurs ∼2.9–3.4 days after the onset of HILDCAA. The dominant acceleration process is due to wave–particle interactions between magnetospheric electromagnetic chorus waves and substorm-injected ∼100 keV electrons. The longer the HILDCAA and chorus last, the higher the maximum energy of the accelerated relativistic electrons. The acceleration to higher and higher energies is due to a bootstrap mechanism.

文章报告了在PSR J0344−0901中探测到的两种现象。第一种现象表现为脉冲发射向较晚的纵向相位移动，然后逐渐返回到原来的位置，持续约216个脉冲周期，平均偏移量约为0.°7。在脉冲轮廓的尖峰处检测到偏振位置角（PPA）的变化，以及脉冲轮廓宽度的增加。第二种现象是亚脉冲的明显移动，导致在轮廓窗口内出现不同的亚脉冲轨迹模式。首次识别出四种发射模式，并确定其中三种的模式周期。未检测到脉冲消失。使用旋转向量模型对PPA的变化进行建模得到该脉冲星的倾斜角为75.°12 ± 3.°80，冲击参数为-3.°17 ± 5.°32。我们推测亚脉冲的移动可能与脉冲发射的移动有关。 <br /><br />总结: 本文报道了在PSR J0344−0901中观测到的两种现象，即脉冲发射的移动和亚脉冲的移动。同时鉴定了四种发射模式，并对其进行了分析。通过对偏振位置角的建模，得到了该脉冲星的倾斜角和冲击参数。对亚脉冲移动与脉冲发射移动的关联进行了推测。 <div>
We report two phenomena detected in PSR J0344−0901 from two observations conducted at frequencies centered at 1.25 GHz using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope. The first phenomenon manifests as the pulse emission shifting to later longitudinal phases and then gradually returning to its original location. The event lasts for about 216 pulse periods, with an average shift of about 0.°7 measured at the peak of the integrated profile. Changes in the polarization position angle (PPA) are detected around the trailing edge of the profile, together with an increase in the profile width. The second phenomenon is characterized by the apparent movement of subpulses, which results in different subpulse track patterns across the profile window. For the first time in this pulsar, we identify four emission modes, each with unique subpulse movement, and determine the pattern periods for three of them. Pulse nulling was not detected. Modeling of the changes in the PPA using the rotating vector model gives an inclination angle of 75.°12 ± 3.°80 and an impact parameter of −3.°17 ± 5.°32 for this pulsar. We speculate that the subpulse movement may be related to the shifting of the pulse emission.

<title>The Cosmic Ultraviolet Baryon Survey (CUBS). VIII. Group Environment of the Most Luminous Quasars at z ≈ 1</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the group-scale environment of 15 luminous quasars (luminosity L3000 > 1046 erg s−1) from the Cosmic Ultraviolet Baryon Survey (CUBS) at redshift z ≈ 1. Using the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer integral field spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope, we conduct a deep galaxy redshift survey in the CUBS quasar fields to identify group members and measure the physical properties of individual galaxies and galaxy groups. We find that the CUBS quasars reside in diverse environments. The majority (11 out of 15) of the CUBS quasars reside in overdense environments with typical halo masses exceeding 1013M⊙, while the remaining quasars reside in moderate-size galaxy groups. No correlation is observed between overdensity and redshift, black hole (BH) mass, or luminosity. Radio-loud quasars (5 out of 15 CUBS quasars) are more likely to be in overdense environments than their radio-quiet counterparts in the sample, consistent with the mean trends from previous statistical observations and clustering analyses. Nonetheless, we also observe radio-loud quasars in moderate groups and radio-quiet quasars in overdense environments, indicating a large scatter in the connection between radio properties and environment. We find that the most UV luminous quasars might be outliers in the stellar mass-to-halo mass relations or may represent departures from the standard single-epoch BH relations.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The intergalactic medium (IGM) contains >50% of the baryonic mass of the Universe, yet the mechanisms responsible for keeping the IGM ionized have not been fully explained. Hence, we investigate ion abundances from the largest blind QSO absorption catalog for clouds that show C iv, N v, and O vi simultaneously. The wavelength range of present UV spectrographs, however, makes it possible to probe C iv and O vi only over a small range of redshift (z ≈ 0.12–0.15). As a result, we only have five IGM absorbing clouds, yet these provide a powerful and representative tool to probe the IGM ionization state. We found one cloud to be in collisional ionization equilibrium while three of the five showed signs of being produced by nonequilibrium processes, specifically conductive interfaces and turbulent mixing layers. None of the models we explore here were able to reproduce the ionization state of the remaining system. Energetic processes, such as galactic feedback from star formation and active galactic nucleus winds, would be excellent candidates that can cause such widespread ionization.

<title>Low-mass Population III Star Formation due to the HD Cooling Induced by Weak Lyman–Werner Radiation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Lyman–Werner (LW) radiation photodissociating molecular hydrogen (H2) influences the thermal and dynamical evolution of the Population III (Pop III) star-forming gas cloud. The effect of powerful LW radiation has been well investigated in the context of supermassive black hole formation in the early Universe. However, the average intensity in the early Universe is several orders of magnitude lower. For a comprehensive study, we investigate the effects of LW radiation at 18 different intensities, ranging from JLW/J21 = 0 (no radiation) to 30 (H-cooling cloud), on the primordial star-forming gas cloud obtained from a three-dimensional cosmological simulation. The overall trend with increasing radiation intensity is a gradual increase in the gas cloud temperature, consistent with previous works. Due to the HD cooling, however, the dependence of gas cloud temperature on JLW deviates from the aforementioned increasing trend for a specific range of intensities (JLW/J21 = 0.025–0.09). In HD-cooling clouds, the temperature remained below 200 K during 105 yr after the first formation of the high-density region, maintaining a low accretion rate. Finally, the HD-cooling clouds have only a low-mass dense core (above 108 cm−3) with about 1–16 M⊙, inside of which a low-mass Pop III star with ≤0.8 M⊙ (a so-called “surviving star”) could form. The upper limit of star formation efficiency significantly decreases from 10−3 to 10−5 as HD cooling becomes effective. This tendency indicates that, whereas the total gas mass in the host halo increases with the LW radiation intensity, the total Pop III stellar mass does not increase similarly.

NICER has observed a few millisecond pulsars where the geometry of the X-ray-emitting hotspots on the neutron star have been analyzed in order to constrain the mass and radius from X-ray light-curve modeling. One example, PSR J0030 + 0451, has been shown to possibly have significant multipolar magnetic fields at the stellar surface. Using force-free simulations of the magnetosphere structure, it has been shown that the radio, X-ray, and γ-ray light curves can be modeled simultaneously with an appropriate field configuration. An even more stringent test is to compare predictions of the force-free magnetosphere model with observations of radio polarization. This paper attempts to reproduce the radio polarization of PSR J0030 + 0451 using a force-free magnetospheric solution. As a result of our modeling, we can reproduce certain features of the polarization well.

<title>Observation of Kinetic Alfvén Waves inside an Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection Magnetic Cloud at 1 au</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent advancements have significantly enhanced our grasp of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) in the heliosphere. These observations have uncovered complex kinematics and structural deformations in ICMEs, hinting at the possible generation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and kinetic-scale waves. While MHD-scale waves in magnetic clouds have been explored, understanding the dynamics of kinetic-scale mode waves remains challenging. This article demonstrates the first in situ observation of kinetic Alfvén waves (KAWs) within an ICME’s magnetic cloud, notably near the heliospheric current sheet–ICME interaction region, close to the reconnection exhaust. Analysis indicates a distinctive negative bump in the estimated normalized magnetic helicity (σm = −0.38) around the gyrofrequency spread, indicating a right-handed polarization of the wave. Furthermore, examination across flow angle (θVB) within the frequency domain reveals a specific zone (90°–135°) showcasing negative helicity fluctuations, confirming the presence of KAWs. Moreover, we noted a significant rise in temperature anisotropy in the vicinity, indicating the role of KAWs in plasma heating. Identifying KAW challenges established notions about ordered magnetic clouds and raises questions about energy transfer processes within these structures. This finding opens the door to a deeper understanding of energy transfer mechanisms within traditionally nondissipative regions and invites further exploration of low-beta plasma heating and the interactions between waves and particles in magnetic clouds.

Primordial black holes (PBHs) could explain some fraction of dark matter and shed light on many areas of early-Universe physics. Despite over half a century of research interest, a PBH population has so far eluded detection. The most competitive constraints on the fraction of dark matter comprised of PBHs (fDM) in the (10−9–10)M⊙ mass ranges come from photometric microlensing and bound fDM ≲ 10−2–10−1. With the advent of the Roman Space Telescope with its submilliarcsecond astrometric capabilities and its planned Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS), detecting astrometric microlensing signatures will become routine. Compared with photometric microlensing, astrometric microlensing signals are sensitive to different lens masses–distance configurations and contain different information, making it a complimentary lensing probe. At submilliarcsecond astrometric precision, astrometric microlensing signals are typically detectable at larger lens–source separations than photometric signals, suggesting a microlensing detection channel of pure astrometric events. We use a Galactic simulation to predict the number of detectable microlensing events during the GBTDS via this pure astrometric microlensing channel. Assuming an absolute astrometric precision floor for bright stars of 0.1 mas for the GBTDS, we find that the number of detectable events peaks at ≈103fDM for a population of 1M⊙ PBHs and tapers to ≈10fDM and ≈100fDM at 10−4M⊙ and 103M⊙, respectively. Accounting for the distinguishability of PBHs from stellar lenses, we conclude the GBTDS will be sensitive to a PBH population at fDM down to ≈10−1–10−3 for (10−1–102)M⊙ likely yielding novel PBH constraints.

<title>The Slipping Magnetic Reconnection and Damped Quasiperiodic Pulsations in a Circular Ribbon Flare</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3353</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The study of circular ribbon (CR) flares is important to understand the three-dimensional magnetic reconnection in the solar atmosphere. We investigate the slipping brightenings and damped quasiperiodic pulsations in a CR flare by multiwavelength observations. During the flaring process, two extreme ultraviolet brightenings (SP1 and SP2) slip synchronously along the ribbon in a counterclockwise direction. The ribbon and fans between them show synchronous enhancement with the microwave and hard X-ray (HXR) CR source. In the magnetohydrostatic extrapolation results and observations, the dome and outer spine display an evident counterclockwise twisting feature. We propose the slipping reconnection occurs between the fan and outer spine in the null point, which covers the region from SP1 to SP2. The fan of SP1 shows the strongest twist and produces the most efficient reconnection. The ribbon after SP1 becomes weak due to the destruction of the fan configuration. The fan of SP2 is in the front of the slipping motion, which initiates new reconnection and brightens the local ribbon. The twisting of the dome continuously promotes new reconnection in the null point, which brightens the ribbon in sequence to display a counterclockwise slipping feature. Thus, the twist of the dome may trigger and dominate the slipping reconnection, and the rotation of the central positive pole could be one possible cause of the twist. After the peak, the microwave and HXR emission shows damped oscillations at a period of 15 s. The collapse of the fan–spine structure may lead to the standing kink oscillations of the fan to modulate the reconnection and particle acceleration process.

<title>Solar Chromospheric Heating by Magnetohydrodynamic Waves: Dependence on the Inclination of the Magnetic Field</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad343f</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A proposed mechanism for solar chromospheric heating is magnetohydrodynamic waves propagating upward along magnetic field lines and dissipating their energy in the chromosphere. In particular, compressible magnetoacoustic waves may contribute to the heating. Theoretically, the components below the cutoff frequency cannot propagate into the chromosphere; however, the cutoff frequency depends on the inclination of the magnetic field lines. In this study, using high-temporal cadence spectral data of IRIS and Hinode Solar Optical Telescope spectropolarimeter in plages, we investigated the dependence of the low-frequency waves on magnetic field properties and quantitatively estimated the amount of energy dissipation in the chromosphere. The following results were obtained: (a) The amount of energy dissipated by the low-frequency component (3–6 mHz) increases with the inclination of the field below 40°, whereas it decreases as a function of the inclination of the field above 40°. (b) The amount of the energy is enhanced toward 104 W m−2, which is the energy required for heating in the chromospheric plage regions when the magnetic field is higher than 600 G and inclined more than 40°. (c) In the photosphere, the low-frequency component has much more power in the magnetic field inclined more and weaker than 400 G. The results suggest that the observed low-frequency components can bring the energy along the magnetic field lines and that only a specific range of the inclination angles of the field and the strength of the field may allow the low-frequency component to bring a sufficient amount of the energy into the chromosphere.

<title>The Carbon Isotopic Ratio and Planet Formation</title>

We present the first detection of 13CCH in a protoplanetary disk (TW Hya). Using observations of C2H, we measure CCH/13CCH = 65 ± 20 gas with a CO isotopic ratio of 12CO/13CO = 21 ± 5. The TW Hya disk exhibits a gas phase C/O that exceeds unity, and C2H is the tracer of this excess carbon. We confirm that the TW Hya gaseous disk exhibits two separate carbon isotopic reservoirs, as noted previously. We explore two theoretical solutions for the development of this dichotomy. One model represents TW Hya today with a protoplanetary disk exposed to a cosmic-ray ionization rate that is below interstellar as consistent with current estimates. We find that this model does not have sufficient ionization in cold (T < 40 K) layers to activate carbon isotopic fractionation. The second model investigates a younger TW Hya protostellar disk exposed to an interstellar cosmic-ray ionization rate. We find that the younger model has sources of ionization deeper in a colder disk that generates two independent isotopic reservoirs. One reservoir is 12C-enriched carried by methane/hydrocarbon ices, and the other is 13C-enriched carried by gaseous CO. The former potentially provides a source of methane/hydrocarbon ices to power the chemistry that generates the anomalously strong C2H emission in this (and other) disk systems in later stages. The latter provides a source of gaseous 13C-rich material to generate isotopic enrichments in forming giant planets, as recently detected in the super-Jupiter TYC 8998-760-1 b by Zhang et al.

We detected a giant X-ray flare from the RS CVn–type binary star UX Ari using the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image on 2020 August 17 and started a series of Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer observations 89 minutes later. For a week, the entire duration of the flare was covered with 32 snapshot observations including the rising phase. The X-ray luminosity reached 2 × 1033 erg s−1, and the entire energy release was ∼1038 erg in the 0.5–8.0 keV band. X-ray spectra characterized by continuum emission with lines of Fe xxv Heα and Fe xxvi Lyα were obtained. We found that the temperature peaks before the flux does, which suggests that the period of plasma formation in the magnetic flare loop was captured. Using the continuum information (temperature, flux, and their delay time), we estimated the flare loop size to be ∼3 × 1011 cm and the peak electron density to be ∼4 × 1010 cm−3. Furthermore, using the line ratio of Fe xxv and Fe xxvi, we investigated any potential indications of deviation from collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE). The X-ray spectra were consistent with CIE plasma throughout the flare, but the possibility of an ionizing plasma away from CIE was not rejected in the flux rising phase.

<title>Constraining the PG 1553+113 Binary Hypothesis: Interpreting Hints of a New, 22 yr Period</title>

<div> PG 1553+113, blazar, quasiperiodic oscillation, 2.2 yr, 22 yr
<br /><br />
PG 1553+113是一个著名的类星体，显示出∼2.2年的准周期振荡(QPO)迹象，这一周期在射电、光学、X射线和γ射线波段均有观测数据支持。研究对其历史光学光变曲线进行了一个世纪的观测，发现了约21.8 ± 4.7年的振荡。尽管这∼22年周期本身的统计显著性只有1.6σ，考虑了观测多处效应后的联合显著性却达到了约3.6σ。22年振荡的次一个峰值预计出现在2025年7月左右。研究还发现，PG 1553+113的两个QPO可以在一个合理的超大质量黑洞二元模型中得到解释，该二元系统的质量比≳0.2，偏心率≲0.1，并从一个特征高度比约0.03的盘吸积。这个假设的二元系统会辐射nHz级别的引力波，但其振幅约为现有脉冲星定时阵列所能检测到的10-100倍。 <div>
PG 1553+113 is a well-known blazar exhibiting evidence of a ∼2.2 yr quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) in the radio, optical, X-ray, and γ-ray bands. Since QPO mechanisms often predict multiple QPOs, we search for a second QPO in its historical optical light curve covering a century of observations. Despite challenging data quality issues, we find hints of a 21.8 ± 4.7 yr oscillation. On its own, this ∼22 yr period has a modest statistical significance of 1.6σ when accounting for the look-elsewhere effect. However, the joint significance of both the 2.2 and 22 yr periods arising from colored noise alone is ∼3.6σ. The next peak of the 22 yr oscillation is predicted to occur around July 2025. We find that such a ∼10:1 relation between two periods can arise in the gas dynamics of a plausible supermassive black hole binary model of PG 1553+113. While the 22 yr QPO is preliminary, an interpretation of PG 1553+113's two QPOs in this binary model suggests that the binary engine has a mass ratio ≳0.2, an eccentricity ≲0.1, and accretes from a disk with characteristic aspect ratio ∼0.03. The putative binary radiates nHz gravitational waves, but the amplitude is ∼10–100 times too low for detection by foreseeable pulsar timing arrays.

<div> 高红移Lyα森林，离子透过现象，平均自由程ABC推断
总结:
高红移Lyα森林的观测数据显示出强烈的变化，不能仅仅归因于密度场的波动。文章提出了两种模型：一种是在红移6以下进行的晚期复电离过程的假设；另一种是与离子化光子的平均自由程和强离子化背景辐射波动有关的模型。通过ABC推断技术对XQR-30在z = 5.0–6.1的有效光学深度分布进行联合约束，推断出观测数据与平均自由程具有波动的模型相吻合，而且平均自由程的平均值与独立测量结果一致，在z ∼ 5–6时有明显的演变，伴随着光电离速率的快速演化。 <div>
The variations in Lyα forest opacity observed at z > 5.3 between lines of sight to different background quasars are too strong to be caused by fluctuations in the density field alone. The leading hypothesis for the cause of this excess variance is a late, ongoing reionization process at redshifts below six. Another model proposes strong ionizing background fluctuations coupled to a short, spatially varying mean free path of ionizing photons, without explicitly invoking incomplete reionization. With recent observations suggesting a short mean free path at z ∼ 6, and a dramatic improvement in z > 5 Lyα forest data quality, we revisit this latter possibility. Here, we apply the likelihood-free inference technique of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to jointly constrain the hydrogen photoionization rate ΓHI and the mean free path of ionizing photons λmfp from the effective optical depth distributions at z = 5.0–6.1 from XQR-30. We find that the observations are well-described by fluctuating mean free path models with average mean free paths that are consistent with the steep trend implied by independent measurements at z ∼ 5–6, with a concomitant rapid evolution of the photoionization rate.

<br />总结: 本研究通过进行八个数量级的电阻率参数研究，探讨了振荡再连接机制的演变以及与空间奇点相关的周期性。通过在不同电阻率水平下对抗性的非线性MHD模拟的解决，采用小波分析、傅立叶变换和ANOVA三种方法研究电阻率与结果周期之间的影响。结果发现背景电阻率水平与振荡再连接机制的周期之间存在独立性。相反，电阻率对当前密度的最大幅值和其衰减速率的性质以及空间奇点处欧姆加热的大小都有显著影响。 <div>
The oscillatory reconnection mechanism is investigated for a parameter study of eight orders of magnitude of resistivity, with a particular interest in the evolution of the oscillating current density at the null point and its associated periodicity. The resistive, nonlinear MHD simulations are solved in 2.5D for different levels of resistivity. Three methods (wavelet analysis, Fourier transform, and ANOVA) are used to investigate the effect of resistivity versus resultant period. It is found that there is an independence between the level of background resistivity and the period of the oscillatory reconnection mechanism. Conversely, it is found that resistivity has a significant effect on the maximum amplitude of the current density and the nature of its decay rate, as well as the magnitude of ohmic heating at the null.

<div> Cepheids, Gaia Data Release 3, kinematics, Galactic warp, precession rate
<br /><br />
Classical Cepheids (CCs) are used to study the kinematics of the Milky Way using data from Gaia Data Release 3. The 3D velocities of 2057 CCs relative to the Galactic center are determined, revealing differences in the VR and Vϕ velocities of the northern and southern warps. This may be related to warp precession or asymmetry in warp structure. The vertical velocities of CCs are found to be more suitable for constraining the warp precession rate. Based on spatial structure parameters, a warp precession rate of ω = 4.9 ± 1.6 km s−1 kpc−1 at 13 kpc is determined, supporting a low precession rate in the warp model. More kinematic information on CCs will help to better constrain the structure and evolution of the Milky Way in the future.

经典可变星、盖亚数据发布3、运动学、银河扭曲、进动速率。研究使用盖亚数据发布3中的经典可变星数据来了解银河系的运动学，通过对2057颗经典可变星的3D速度进行分析发现，南北扭曲的径向速度和方位速度存在差异，可能与扭曲的进动或结构不对称有关。同时发现，经典可变星的垂直速度更适合约束扭曲的进动速率。基于空间结构参数，确定了银河系13千秒差距处的扭曲进动速率为ω = 4.9 ± 1.6 km s−1 kpc−1，支持了扭曲模型中的低进动速率。未来更多关于经典可变星的运动学信息将有助于更好地约束银河系的结构和演化。 <div>
Classical Cepheids (CCs) are excellent tracers for understanding the structure of the Milky Way disk. The latest Gaia Data Release 3 provides a large number of line-of-sight velocity information for Galactic CCs, offering an opportunity for studying the kinematics of the Milky Way. We determine the 3D velocities of 2057 CCs relative to the Galactic center. From the projections of the 3D velocities onto the X–Y plane of the Galactic disk, we find that the VR and Vϕ velocities of the northern and southern warps (directions with highest amplitude) are different. This phenomenon may be related to warp precession or asymmetry in warp structure. By investigating the kinematic warp model, we find that the vertical velocities of CCs are more suitable for constraining the warp precession rate than the line-of-node angle. Our results suggest that CCs at 12–14 kpc are the best sample for determining the Galactic warp precession rate. Based on the spatial structure parameters of Cepheid warp from Chen et al., we determine a warp precession rate of ω = 4.9 ± 1.6 km s−1 kpc−1 at 13 kpc, which supports a low precession rate in the warp model. In the future, more kinematic information on CCs will help to constrain the structure and evolution of the Milky Way better.

Using Gaia DR3 data, we revisit 56 high Galactic latitude (∣b∣ ≥ 30°) open cluster (OC) candidates with poor shapes of color–magnitude diagrams (CMDs), including unclear and paired main sequences (MSs). We aim to confirm their physical reality and explore whether the special MS morphology is intrinsic to genuine OCs. Initially, we redetermine cluster memberships by integrating five outlier detection algorithms into pyUPMASK. However, this work fails to reproduce the 56 clusters. Instead, we find an alternative set of 56 clusters, six of which are non-duplicates. To ascertain whether the six clusters are real OCs, we build synthetic CMDs to derive reliable cluster properties, including fundamental parameters, binary fraction, and mass of the cluster. Subsequently, we investigate the structural parameters and the age–mass and mass–radius relations of the six candidate OCs. Finally, we utilize a multidimensional approach, incorporating cluster properties, spatial structure, kinematic attributes, and CMD verification, to assess their physical reality as genuine OCs further. Our results suggest that the six candidates should be physical OCs, exhibiting well-defined CMD characteristics. Moreover, we discover two of the six OCs as potential binary clusters.

总结:<br /><br />SGR J1935+2154是迄今为止最多产的磁星之一，其爆发活跃，且发出了第一个与X射线爆发相关联的银河快速射电爆发。研究采用了新颖的时间分辨光谱分析技术，成功探测了磁星爆发的真实光谱演化。研究结果对其他磁星的平均爆发特性进行了比较分析，具有重要的科学意义。 <div>
SGR J1935+2154 has truly been the most prolific magnetar over the last decade: it has been entering into burst active episodes once every 1–2 yr since its discovery in 2014, it emitted the first Galactic fast radio burst associated with an X-ray burst in 2020, and it has emitted hundreds of energetic short bursts. Here, we present the time-resolved spectral analysis of 51 bright bursts from SGR J1935+2154. Unlike conventional time-resolved X-ray spectroscopic studies in the literature, we follow a two-step approach to probe true spectral evolution. For each burst, we first extract spectral information from overlapping time segments, fit them with three continuum models, and employ a machine-learning-based clustering algorithm to identify time segments that provide the largest spectral variations during each burst. We then extract spectra from those nonoverlapping (clustered) time segments and fit them again with the three models: the cutoff power-law model, the sum of two blackbody functions, and the model considering the emission of a modified blackbody undergoing resonant cyclotron scattering, which is applied systematically at this scale for the first time. Our novel technique allowed us to establish the genuine spectral evolution of magnetar bursts. We discuss the implications of our results and compare their collective behavior with the average burst properties of other magnetars.

总结:<br />
MMS任务通过测量电磁场，构建了一个湍流磁重连区域的试验粒子模拟，以研究观测到的离子加速现象。研究发现三种能量化的离子类型：离子喷流、Speiser样式的能量化离子以及由湍流场加速至较高能量的离子。大多数被湍流场能量化的离子会多次穿过磁场的零点平面。这些发现表明湍流在加速粒子中起到重要作用，并且最高加速能量受湍流区域的大小限制。由于湍流在宇宙等离子体中普遍存在且在尺度上没有限制，MMS的观测结果暗示湍流可能在粒子加速中起到重要作用。 <div>
Using electric and magnetic fields measured by the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission, we construct a test-particle simulation of a turbulent magnetic reconnection region to investigate observed ion acceleration. We identify three types of energized ions: (1) ion jets, (2) Speiser-like energized ions—both of which carry significant energy but do not produce a strong energetic (>80 keV) tail in the ion distribution—and (3) a separate but sizable population of ions that are accelerated to significantly higher energies (>80 keV) by the turbulent fields. The majority of ions that undergo energization by the turbulent fields cross the magnetic null plane multiple times. By preferentially energizing these particles, the turbulence creates a separate population of ions that mostly exits in the dawn direction of the magnetotail and forms a high-energy power-law tail in the ion flux-energy distribution. We also find that the highest acceleration energies are limited by the size of the turbulent region (with respect to ion gyroradii). Since turbulence is widespread in astrophysical plasmas and has no a priori limit on scale size, the MMS observations suggest turbulence may have a significant role in particle acceleration.

We report multifrequency and multiepoch very long baseline interferometry studies of the subparsec jet in the Sombrero galaxy (M104, NGC 4594). Using Very Long Baseline Array data at 12, 22, 44, and 88 GHz, we study the kinematics of the jet and the properties of the compact core. The subparsec jet is clearly detected at 12 and 22 GHz, and the inner jet base is resolved down to ∼70 Schwarzschild radii (Rs) at 44 GHz. The proper motions of the jet are measured with apparent subrelativistic speeds of 0.20 ± 0.08c and 0.05 ± 0.02c for the approaching and the receding jet, respectively. Based on the apparent speed and jet-to-counterjet brightness ratio, we estimate the jet viewing angle to be larger than ∼37°, and the intrinsic speed to be between ∼0.10c and 0.40c. Their joint probability distribution suggests the most probable values of the viewing angle and intrinsic speed to be and 0.19 ± 0.04c, respectively. We also find that the measured brightness temperatures of the core at 12, 22, and 44 GHz are close to the equipartition brightness temperature, indicating that the energy density of the radiating particles is comparable to the energy density of the magnetic field in the subparsec jet region. Interestingly, the measured core size at 88 GHz (∼25 ± 5 Rs) deviates from the expected frequency dependence seen at lower frequencies. This may indicate a different origin for the millimeter emission, which can be explained by an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model. This model further predicts that at 230 and 340 GHz, the ADAF may dominate the radio emission over the jet.

<title>The ΛCDM-NG Cosmological Model: A Possible Resolution of the Hubble Tension</title>

<div> ΛCDM, general relativity, Hubble tension, alternative cosmological models, gravitational potential<br />
总结: 这篇文章提出了一种基于常规广义相对论的宇宙学模型，可以解决哈勃张力的问题。重新分析ΛCDM模型的基础，表明广义相对论本身并没有明确规定质量密度的哪一部分作为弗里德曼方程的源项，以及哪一部分作为浓缩物体的引力势源。这为常规广义相对论内的另类宇宙模型打开了途径，并证明ΛCDM模型并非是通常引力源下爱因斯坦方程的唯一解。文章强调了ΛCDM模型中引力势源的来源是质量密度偏差，而不是像牛顿理论中一样的浓缩质量总密度。ΛCDM-NG模型利用了引力势源的自由度，将物质在两个源项之间移动，将引力势的源复原为牛顿形式。在ΛCDM-NG模型中不存在哈勃张力，如果浓缩物体的引力势在某个范围内，而这个范围对于实际宇宙来说并不是不合理的。ΛCDM-NG模型中的减速参数与ΛCDM模型不同，这提示了两个模型之间的区别的一个测试方法。 <div>
We offer a cosmological model based on conventional general relativity (no speculative physics) that may resolve the Hubble tension. A reanalysis of the foundation of the Lambda-CDM model shows that general relativity alone does not specify what fraction of the mass density acts as the source term in Friedmann’s equation and what fraction acts as the source of the gravitational potential of condensed objects. This observation opens the way to alternative cosmological models within conventional general relativity, and it proves that the ΛCDM model is not the unique solution of Einstein’s equations for the usual cosmological sources of gravitation. We emphasize that the source of the gravitation potential in the ΛCDM model is the deviation δρm of the mass density away from its average value, and not the total density of condensed masses as in Newtonian theory. Though not often stated, this is a modification of Newtonian gravitation within the ΛCDM model. The ΛCDM-NG model uses the freedom to move matter between source terms to restore the source of gravitational potential to its Newtonian form. There is no Hubble tension in the ΛCDM-NG model if the gravitational potential of condensed objects (stars, galaxies, and dark matter clouds) falls in a certain range, a range that does not seem unreasonable for the actual Universe. The deceleration parameter in the ΛCDM-NG model differs from that in the ΛCDM model, suggesting a test to distinguish between the two models.

<title>Efficiency of Nonthermal Pulsed Emission from Eight MeV Pulsars</title>

<div> 关键词: MeV pulsars, X-ray emission, efficiency, pair multiplicity, viewing angle

总结: 
MeV pulsars的X射线发射具有较高的辐射效率和硬谱，与Fermi-LAT脉冲星相比。估计其辐射效率在keV-MeV能带上在0.01-0.1之间，需要的对数增倍数为10^4-10^7。这表明MeV脉冲星的X射线/软伽马射线发射可能由GeV光子产生的次级对产生。其差异可能与观测角度或者磁轴倾斜角度有关。 <div>
We report on the properties of pulsed X-ray emission from eight MeV pulsars using XMM-Newton, NICER, NuSTAR, and HXMT data. For five of the eight MeV pulsars, the X-ray spectra can be fit by a broken power-law model with a break energy of ∼5–10 keV. The photon indices below and above the break energy are ∼1 and ∼1.5, respectively. In comparison with the X-ray emission of the Fermi-LAT pulsars, the MeV pulsars have a harder spectrum and a higher radiation efficiency in the 0.3–10 keV energy bands. When isotropic emission is assumed, the emission efficiency in the keV–MeV bands is estimated to be ηMeV ∼ 0.01–0.1, and this is similar to the efficiency of the GeV emission of the Fermi-LAT pulsars with a similar spin-down power. To explain the observed efficiency of the MeV pulsars, we estimate the required pair multiplicity as 104–7, which depends on the emission process (curvature radiation or synchrotron radiation) and on the location in the magnetosphere. The high multiplicity indicates that the secondary pairs that are created by a pair-creation process of the GeV photons produce the X-ray/soft gamma-ray emission of the MeV pulsars. We speculate that the difference between MeV pulsars and Fermi-LAT pulsars can be attributed to the difference in viewing angle measured from the spin axis if the emission originates from a region inside the light cylinder (canonical gap model) or to the difference in the inclination angle of the magnetic axis if the emission is produced in the equatorial current sheet outside the light cylinder.

We present a method to quantify the convergence rate of the fast estimators of the covariance matrices in the large-scale structure analysis. Our method is based on the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence, which describes the relative entropy of two probability distributions. As a case study, we analyze the delete-d jackknife estimator for the covariance matrix of the galaxy correlation function. We introduce the information factor or the normalized KL divergence with the help of a set of baseline covariance matrices to diagnose the information contained in the jackknife covariance matrix. Using a set of quick particle mesh mock catalogs designed for the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey DR11 CMASS galaxy survey, we find that the jackknife resampling method succeeds in recovering the covariance matrix with 10 times fewer simulation mocks than that of the baseline method at small scales (s ≤ 40 h−1 Mpc). However, the ability to reduce the number of mock catalogs is degraded at larger scales due to the increasing bias on the jackknife covariance matrix. Note that the analysis in this paper can be applied to any fast estimator of the covariance matrix for galaxy clustering measurements.

<div> SMDS, RST, JWST, dark matter, redshift<br />总结:<br />在早期宇宙形成的超大质量暗物质星体(SMDS)通过Roman Space Telescope (RST)能够被识别，可以使用拉曼散射望远镜辨别SMDS和早期星系，而James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)的光谱技术能够辨别SMDS的吸收线，结合两者的使用可以更好地研究SMDS，并推测这种新型星体可能由暗物质提供能量，或许可以解开观测到的z>6明亮类星体的超大质量黑洞的起源之谜。 <div>
Supermassive dark stars (SMDS) are luminous stellar objects formed in the early Universe at redshift z ∼ 10–20, made primarily of hydrogen and helium, yet powered by dark matter. We examine the capabilities of the Roman Space Telescope (RST), and find it able to identify ∼106M⊙ SMDSs at redshifts up to z ≃ 14. With a gravitational lensing factor of μ ∼ 100, RST could identify SMDS as small as ∼104M⊙ at z ∼ 12 with ∼106 s exposure. Differentiating SMDSs from early galaxies containing zero metallicity stars at similar redshifts requires spectral, photometric, and morphological comparisons. With only RST, the differentiation of SMDS, particularly those formed via adiabatic contraction with M ≳ 105M⊙ and lensed by μ ≳ 100, is possible due to their distinct photometric signatures from the first galaxies. Those formed via dark matter capture can be differentiated only by image morphology: i.e., point object (SMDSs) versus extended object (sufficiently magnified galaxies). By additionally employing James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) spectroscopy, we can identify the He iiλ1640 absorption line, a smoking gun for SMDS detection. Although RST does not cover the required wavelength band (for zemi ≳ 10), JWST does; hence, the two can be used in tandem to identify SMDS. The detection of SMDS would confirm a new type of star powered by dark matter and may shed light on the origins of the supermassive black holes powering bright quasars observed at z ≳ 6.

<div> 红巨星，光谱，数据驱动模型，扩散星际带，恒星参数
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章主要使用了大量的红巨星光谱数据，创建了恒星参数的二阶多项式模型，以研究恒星光谱中非恒星信息，如扩散星际带。研究发现，许多光谱残留特征可以归因于来自地球大气和星际介质的扩散星际带的残留。在去除大部分地球大气残留后，确定了84个吸收特征，其中25个是扩散星际带，并且可以为银河星际介质科学和正在进行的Sloan Digital Sky Survey V的银河调查项目提供重要帮助。 <div>
Data-driven models of stellar spectra are useful tools to study nonstellar information, such as the diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) caused by intervening interstellar material. Using ∼55,000 spectra of ∼17,000 red clump stars from the APOGEE DR16 data set, we create second-order polynomial models of the continuum-normalized flux as a function of stellar parameters (Teff, , [Fe/H], [α/Fe], and age). The model and data show good agreement within uncertainties across the APOGEE wavelength range, although many regions reveal residuals that are not in the stellar rest-frame. We show that many of these residual features—having average extrema at the level of ∼3% in stellar flux on average—can be attributed to incompletely removed spectral lines from the Earth’s atmosphere and DIBs from the interstellar medium (ISM). After removing most of the remaining contamination from Earth’s sky, we identify 84 absorption features not seen in unreddened sightlights that have <50% probability of being noise artifacts—with 25 of these features having <5% probability of being noise artifacts—including all 10 previously known DIBs in the APOGEE wavelength range. Because many of these features occur in the wavelength windows that APOGEE uses to measure chemical abundances, note that characterization and removal of this nonstellar contamination establish an important step in reaching the precision required for chemical tagging experiments. Proper characterization of these features will benefit Galactic ISM science and the currently ongoing Milky Way Mapper program of Sloan Digital Sky Survey V, which relies on the APOGEE spectrograph.

This study probes the chemical abundances of the neutron-capture elements cerium and neodymium in the inner Milky Way from an analysis of a sample of ∼2000 stars in the Galactic bulge bar spatially contained within ∣XGal∣ < 5 kpc, ∣YGal∣ < 3.5 kpc, and ∣ZGal∣ < 1 kpc, and spanning metallicities between −2.0 ≲ [Fe/H] ≲ +0.5. We classify the sample stars into low- or high-[Mg/Fe] populations and find that, in general, values of [Ce/Fe] and [Nd/Fe] increase as the metallicity decreases for the low- and high-[Mg/Fe] populations. Ce abundances show a more complex variation across the metallicity range of our bulge-bar sample when compared to Nd, with the r-process dominating the production of neutron-capture elements in the high-[Mg/Fe] population ([Ce/Nd] < 0.0). We find a spatial chemical dependence of Ce and Nd abundances for our sample of bulge-bar stars, with low- and high-[Mg/Fe] populations displaying a distinct abundance distribution. In the region close to the center of the MW, the low-[Mg/Fe] population is dominated by stars with low [Ce/Fe], [Ce/Mg], [Nd/Mg], [Nd/Fe], and [Ce/Nd] ratios. The low [Ce/Nd] ratio indicates a significant contribution in this central region from r-process yields for the low-[Mg/Fe] population. The chemical pattern of the most metal-poor stars in our sample suggests an early chemical enrichment of the bulge dominated by yields from core-collapse supernovae and r-process astrophysical sites, such as magnetorotational supernovae.

总结：<br /><br />本文提出了一个统一的几何模型，用于区分重复器和非重复器的快速射电爆发。在这个模型中，考虑了中子星磁层内的准切向传播效应。观测到的偏振特性是验证这一统一几何模型的重要线索，因为偏振对准切向传播效应敏感。此外，我们的模型有效解释了频带宽度，持续时间，峰值亮度，能量，亮度温度，时间-频率向下漂移和重复率等其他区分特性，为支持快速射电爆发的磁层起源提供了令人信服的证据。 <div>
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration extragalactic radio transients. They fall into the categories of repeaters and apparent nonrepeaters. However, such a classification causes a lack of motivation to investigate the physical picture. Here, we propose a unified geometric model to distinguish between repeaters and apparent nonrepeaters, in which the quasi-tangential (QT) propagation effect within the magnetosphere of a neutron star is considered. In this model, apparent nonrepeaters arise from sources whose emitting region has a smaller impact angle with respect to the magnetic axis, while repeaters come from sources whose emitting region has a larger impact angle. The observational discriminant polarization properties between repeaters and apparent nonrepeaters are an important clue for verifying this unified geometric model since the polarization is sensitive to the QT propagation effect. Moreover, our model effectively explains all of the other discriminant properties, including bandwidth, duration, peak luminosity, energy, brightness temperature, time–frequency downward drifting, and repetition rate, providing compelling evidence for the magnetospheric origin of FRBs.

The physics potential of detecting 8B solar neutrinos will be exploited at the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), in a model-independent manner by using three distinct channels of the charged current (CC), neutral current (NC), and elastic scattering (ES) interactions. Due to the largest-ever mass of 13C nuclei in the liquid scintillator detectors and the expected low background level, 8B solar neutrinos are observable in the CC and NC interactions on 13C for the first time. By virtue of optimized event selections and muon veto strategies, backgrounds from the accidental coincidence, muon-induced isotopes, and external backgrounds can be greatly suppressed. Excellent signal-to-background ratios can be achieved in the CC, NC, and ES channels to guarantee the observation of the 8B solar neutrinos. From the sensitivity studies performed in this work, we show that JUNO, with 10 yr of data, can reach the 1σ precision levels of 5%, 8%, and 20% for the 8B neutrino flux, , and , respectively. Probing the details of both solar physics and neutrino physics would be unique and helpful. In addition, when combined with the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory measurement, the world's best precision of 3% is expected for the measurement of the 8B neutrino flux.

We analyze a sample of 244 ram-pressure-stripped candidate galaxy members within the virial radius of 62 nearby clusters to determine their velocity anisotropy profile β(r). We use previously determined mass profiles for the 62 clusters to build an ensemble cluster by stacking the 62 cluster samples in projected phase space. We solve the Jeans equation for dynamical equilibrium by two methods, MAMPOSSt and the Jeans inversion technique, and determine β(r) both in parametric form and nonparametrically. The two methods consistently indicate that the orbits of the ram-pressure-stripped candidates are increasingly radial with distance from the cluster center, from almost isotropic (β ≃ 0) at the center, to very radial at the virial radius (β ≃ 0.7). The orbits of cluster galaxies undergoing ram pressure stripping are similar to those of spiral cluster galaxies but more radially elongated at large radii.

We explore the cosmological implications of the local limit of nonlocal gravity, which is a classical generalization of Einstein’s theory of gravitation within the framework of teleparallelism. An appropriate solution of this theory is the modified Cartesian flat cosmological model. The main purpose of this paper is to study linear perturbations about the orthonormal tetrad frame field adapted to the standard comoving observers in this model. The observational viability of the perturbed model is examined using all available data regarding the cosmic microwave background. The implications of the linearly perturbed modified Cartesian flat model are examined and it is shown that the model is capable of alleviating the H0 tension.

The calculation of internal atmospheric (longwave) fluxes is a key component of any model of exoplanet atmospheres that requires radiative-transfer (RT) calculations. For atmospheres containing a strong scattering component such as cloud particles, most 1D multiple-scattering RT methods typically involve numerically expensive matrix inversions. This computational bottleneck is exacerbated when multitudes of RT calculations are required, such as in general circulation models (GCMs) and retrieval methods. In an effort to increase the speed of RT calculations without sacrificing too much accuracy, we investigate the applicability of approximate longwave scattering methods developed for the Earth science community to hot Jupiter atmospheres. We test the absorption approximation and variational iteration method (VIM) applied to typical cloudy hot Jupiter scenarios, using 64-stream DISORT calculations as reference solutions. We find the four-stream VIM variant is a highly promising method to explore for use in hot Jupiter GCM and retrieval modeling, and it shows excellent speed characteristics, with typical errors ∼1% for outgoing fluxes and within ∼50%, but with larger errors in the test case of a deep cloud layer, for vertical heating rates. Other methods explored in this study were found to typically produce similar error characteristics in vertical heating rates.

Using the Stream Interaction Regions list from the Tianwen-1/Mars Orbiter Magnetometer (MOMAG) data between 2021 November and 2021 December and from Wind observations, we present an accurate prediction for the arrival time and in situ parameters of corotating interaction regions (CIRs) when the Earth and Mars have large longitudinal separations. Since CIRs were detected earlier at Earth than at Mars during the period examined, we employ Earth-based CIR detections for predicting CIR observations at Mars. The arrival time is calculated by the Parker spiral model under the assumption of steady corotation of the Sun and coronal holes, while the in situ parameters are derived from Wind data through radial dependent scaling laws. The CIR prediction results are compared to the actual observations obtained from the MOMAG and Mars Ion and Neutral Particle Analyzer instruments onboard Tianwen-1, as well as the Magnetometer and Solar Wind Ion Analyzer instruments onboard MAVEN. The predicted arrival time is close to the observed values with relative errors less than 10%, and the expected in situ data show a good consistency with the Martian measurements. The comparison results indicate that the prediction method has good performance and will be helpful for comparative analysis with Tianwen-1 observations at Mars in the future.

<div> 高红移星系，尘埃温度，模拟，观测，挑战
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了利用JWST和ALMA等设备在高红移宇宙黎明时期研究星系尘埃温度的挑战。作者使用simba模型和powderday辐射传输结合，准确预测了高红移星系尘埃的演化，但模型中的一些方面仍然是自由参数，限制了模型的预测能力。同时，他们强调了通过观测数据对星系尘埃温度进行反推的方法存在不确定性，常用的模型和假设往往无法捕捉高红移尘埃星系的复杂性。作者警告说，由于分辨率和后处理技术的限制，以及观测数据的稀缺性和简化的模型参数化，从模拟和观测中推断出的结论都面临着独特和微妙的不确定性，这些不确定性可能会限制当前高红移尘埃测量的有效性。 <div>
In the current era of high-z galaxy discovery with JWST and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, our ability to study the stellar populations and interstellar medium conditions in a diverse range of galaxies at Cosmic Dawn has rapidly improved. At the same time, the need to understand the current limitations in modeling galaxy formation processes and physical properties in order to interpret these observations is critical. Here, we study the challenges in modeling galaxy dust temperatures, both in the context of forward modeling galaxy spectral properties from a hydrodynamical simulation and via backwards modeling galaxy physical properties from mock observations of far-infrared dust emission. Using the simba model for galaxy formation combined with powderday radiative transfer, we can accurately predict the evolution of dust at high redshift, though several aspects of the model are essentially free parameters (dust composition, subresolution dust in star-forming regions) that dull the predictive power of the model dust temperature distributions. We also highlight the uncertainties in the backwards modeling methods, where we find the commonly used models and assumptions to fit far-infrared spectral energy distributions and infer dust temperatures (e.g., single temperature, optically thin modified blackbody) largely fail to capture the complexity of high-z dusty galaxies. We caution that conclusions inferred from both simulations—limited by resolution and post-processing techniques—and observations—limited by sparse data and simplistic model parameterizations—are susceptible to unique and nuanced uncertainties that can limit the usefulness of current high-z dust measurements.

<title>Bell Instability–mediated Diffusive Shock Acceleration at Supernova Blast Wave Shock Propagating in the Interstellar Medium</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Supernova blast wave shock is a very important site of cosmic-ray acceleration. However, the detailed physical process of acceleration, in particular, nonlinear interplay between cosmic-ray streaming and magnetic field amplification, has not been studied under a realistic environment. In this paper, using a unique and novel numerical method, we study cosmic-ray acceleration at supernova blast wave shock propagating in the interstellar medium with well-resolved magnetic field amplification by nonresonant hybrid instability (or Bell instability). We find that the magnetic field is mildly amplified under typical interstellar medium conditions that leads to maximum cosmic-ray energy ≃30 TeV for supernova remnants with age ≃1000 yr consistent with gamma-ray observations. The strength of the amplified magnetic field does not reach the so-called saturation level because the cosmic-ray electric current toward the shock upstream has a finite spatial extent, by which Bell instability cannot experience many e-folding times.

<title>XMM–NuSTAR Observation and Multiwavelength Spectral Energy Distribution Modeling of Blazar 4FGL J1520.8–0348</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can power relativistic jets, which are called blazars when pointed close to our line of sight. Depending on the presence or absence of emission lines in their optical spectra, blazars are categorized into flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) or BL Lacertae (BL Lac) objects. According to the “blazar sequence,” as synchrotron peak frequency ( ) shifts to higher energies, the synchrotron peak luminosity decreases. This means that BL Lac objects as luminous as FSRQs, and with synchrotron peak frequencies Hz, should not exist. Detected as a high-synchrotron peak (HSP; Hz) BL Lac object, 4FGL J1520.8-0348 shows high γ-ray luminosity (Lγ > 1046 erg s−1), being at a high redshift of z = 1.46. Since it is an outlier in the “blazar sequence,” the process of its jet acceleration and power may be different from bona fide BL Lac objects. In this work, we constrain its spectral energy distribution (SED) by modeling the multiwavelength data from infrared to γ-ray regime. Simultaneous X-ray data were obtained from X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission and Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array to constrain the synchrotron emission and underlying electron distribution. On undertaking the SED modeling of the source, including the effect of extragalactic background light, we conclude that the source is more likely to be a “blue FSRQ” or “masquerading BL Lac” where the BL Lac object is actually an FSRQ in disguise.

<title>Compton Scattering of Electrons in the Intergalactic Medium</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3237</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This paper investigates the distribution and implications of cosmic-ray electrons within the intergalactic medium (IGM). Utilizing a synthesis model of the extragalactic background, we evolve the spectrum of Compton-included cosmic rays. The energy density distribution of cosmic-ray electrons peaks at redshift z ≈ 2, and peaks in the ∼MeV range. The fractional contribution of cosmic-ray pressure to the general IGM pressure progressively increases toward lower redshift. At mean density, the ratio of cosmic-ray electron to thermal pressure in the IGM is 0.3% at z = 2, rising to 1.0% at z = 1, and 1.8% at z = 0.1 (considering only the cosmic rays produced locally by Compton scattering). We compute the linear Landau damping rate of plasma oscillations in the IGM caused by the ∼MeV cosmic-ray electrons, and find it to be of order ∼10−6 s−1 for wavenumbers 1.2 ≲ ck/ωp ≲ 5 at z = 2 and mean density (where ωp is the plasma frequency). This strongly affects the fate of TeV e+e− pair beams produced by blazars, which are potentially unstable to oblique instabilities involving plasma oscillations with wavenumber (θ being the angle between the beam and wavevector). Linear Landau damping is at least thousands of times faster than either pair beam instability growth or collisional effects; it thus turns off the pair beam instability except for modes with very small θ (ck/ωp → 1, where linear Landau damping is kinematically suppressed). This leaves open the question of whether the pair beam instability is turned off entirely, or can still proceed via the small-θ modes.

<title>Observability of Substructures in the Planet-forming Disk in the (Sub)centimeter Wavelength with SKA and ngVLA</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Current imaging observations of protoplanetary disks using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) primarily focus on the submillimeter wavelength, leaving a gap in effective observational approaches for centimeter-sized dust, which is crucial to the issue of planet formation. The forthcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and ngVLA may rectify this deficiency. In this paper, we employ multifluid hydrodynamic numerical simulations and radiative transfer calculations to investigate the potential of SKA1-Mid, ngVLA, and SKA2 for imaging protoplanetary disks at subcentimeter/centimeter wavelengths. We create mock images with ALMA/SKA/ngVLA at multiwavelengths based on the hydrodynamical simulation output and test different sensitivity and spatial resolutions. We discover that both SKA and ngVLA will serve as excellent supplements to the existing observational range of ALMA, and their high resolution enables them to image substructures in the disk’s inner region (∼5 au from the stellar). Our results indicate that SKA and ngVLA can be utilized for more extended monitoring programs in the centimeter wave band. While in the subcentimeter range, ngVLA possesses the capability to produce high-fidelity images within shorter observation times (∼1 hr on source time) than previous research, holding potential for future survey observations. We also discuss for the first time the potential of SKA2 for observing protoplanetary disks at a 0.7 cm wavelength.

<title>Persistent Upflows and Downflows at Active Region Boundaries Observed by SUTRI and AIA</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Upflows and downflows at active region (AR) boundaries have been frequently observed with spectroscopic observations at extreme ultraviolet passbands. In this paper, we report the coexistence of upflows and downflows at the AR boundaries with imaging observations from the Solar Upper Transition Region Imager (SUTRI) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). With their observations from 2022 September 21 to 2022 September 30, we find 17 persistent opposite flows occurring along the AR coronal loops. The upflows are prominent in the AIA 193 Å images with a velocity of 50–200 km s−1, while the downflows are best seen in the SUTRI 465 Å and AIA 131 Å images with a slower velocity of tens of kilometers per second (characteristic temperatures (log T(K)) for 193, 465, and 131 Å are 6.2, 5.7, and 5.6, respectively). We also analyze the center-to-limb variation of the velocities for both upflows and downflows. The simultaneous observations of downflows and upflows can be explained by the chromosphere–corona mass-cycling process, in which the localized chromospheric plasma is impulsively heated to coronal temperature forming a upflow and then these upflows experience radiative cooling producing a downflow with the previously heated plasma returning to the lower atmosphere. In particular, the persistent downflows seen by SUTRI provide strong evidence of the cooling process in the mass cycle. For upflows associated with open loops, part of the plasma is able to escape outward and into the heliosphere as solar wind.

Sub/millimeter galaxies are a key population for the study of galaxy evolution because the majority of star formation at high redshifts occurred in galaxies deeply embedded in dust. To search for this population, we have performed an extensive survey with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), called the ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey (ALCS). This survey covers 133 arcmin2 area and securely detects 180 sources at z ∼ 0.5–6 with a flux limit of ∼0.2 mJy at 1.2 mm. Here, we report the results of multiwavelength spectral energy distribution analysis of the whole ALCS sample, utilizing the observed-frame UV to millimeter photometry. We find that the majority of the ALCS sources lie on the star-forming main sequence, with a smaller fraction showing intense starburst activities. The ALCS sample contains high infrared-excess sources ( ), including two extremely dust-obscured galaxies (IRX > 5). We also confirm that the ALCS sample probes a broader range in lower dust mass than conventional submillimeter galaxy samples in the same redshift range. We identify six heavily obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates that are not detected in the archival Chandra data in addition to the three X-ray AGNs reported by Uematsu et al. (2023). The inferred AGN luminosity density shows a possible excess at z = 2–3 compared with that determined from X-ray surveys below 10 keV.

Solar radio U-bursts are generated by electron beams traveling along closed magnetic loops in the solar corona. Low-frequency (<100 MHz) U-bursts serve as powerful diagnostic tools for studying large-sized coronal loops that extend into the middle corona. However, the positive frequency drift component (descending leg) of U-bursts has received less attention in previous studies, as the descending radio flux is weak. In this study, we utilized LOFAR interferometric solar imaging data from a U-burst that has a significant descending leg component, observed between 10 and 90 MHz on 2020 June 5th. By analyzing the radio source centroid positions, we determined the beam velocities and physical parameters of a large coronal magnetic loop that reached just about 1.3 R⊙ in altitude. At this altitude, we found the plasma temperature to be around 1.1 MK, the plasma pressure around 0.20 mdyn, cm−2, and the minimum magnetic field strength around 0.07 G. The similarity in physical properties determined from the image suggests a symmetric loop. The average electron beam velocity on the ascending leg was found to be 0.21c, while it was 0.14c on the descending leg. This apparent deceleration is attributed to a decrease in the range of electron energies that resonate with Langmuir waves, likely due to the positive background plasma density gradient along the downward loop leg.

这篇文章是关于红超巨星（RSGs）的下质量限的研究。通过对6602个星体进行分析，使用了五种不同的方法来区分不同的恒星族群。其中机器学习和χ2方法提供了最佳和相对一致的预测。研究得出RSG族群的下限能够达到红巨星分支的Ks带顶部，表明其亮度低至约103.5倍太阳亮度，对应于约100个太阳半径的恒星半径。根据质量-亮度关系，考虑到失去质量的微弱RSGs，RSG族群的最小初始质量约为6.1±0.4太阳质量。这是第一次光谱证据表明RSG族群的下质量限约为6太阳质量。然而，这些微弱RSGs的命运仍然难以捉摸，并可能对恒星演化和超新星模型产生重大影响。
<br /><br />总结: RSGs的下质量限研究，使用了多种分析方法，确定了RSG族群的下限，并得出了其最小初始质量，为6.1±0.4太阳质量。这为恒星演化和超新星模型提供了重要线索。 <div>
The precise definition of the lower mass limit of red supergiant stars (RSGs) is an open question in astrophysics and does not attract much attention. Here, we assemble a spectroscopic evolved cool star sample with 6602 targets, including RSGs, asymptotic giant branch stars, and red giant branch stars, in the Large Magellanic Cloud based on Gaia DR3 and Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV/APOGEE-2. The reference spectrum of each stellar population is built according to the quantile range of relative intensity (1% ∼ 99%). Five different methods, e.g., χ2, cosine similarity, machine learning (ML), equivalent width, and line ratio, are used in order to separate different stellar populations. ML and χ2 provide the best and relatively consistent prediction of a certain population. The derived lower limit of the RSG population is able to reach the Ks-band tip of the red giant branch (Ks ≈12.0 mag), indicating a luminosity as low as about 103.5L⊙, which corresponds to a stellar radius of only about 100 R⊙. Given the mass–luminosity relation of with f ≈ 15.5 ± 3 and taking into account the mass loss of faint RSGs up to now, the minimal initial mass of the RSG population would be about 6.1 ± 0.4 M⊙, which is much lower than the traditional threshold of 8 M⊙ for the massive stars. This is the first spectroscopic evidence, indicating that the lower mass limit of the RSG population is around 6 M⊙. However, the destinies of such faint RSGs are still elusive and may have a large impact on stellar evolutionary and supernova models.

总结: 该研究对大质量星系中介质的局部密度层化区域进行了高分辨率的流体动力学模拟。研究发现SNe Ia在介质中产生了主要是压缩性的湍流，触发了介质的多相凝结，形成了多种气体。当净冷却率低于净加热率时，SNe Ia产生的热风席卷了局部大部分物质。需要全局模拟来评估这些气体的最终命运。 <div>
Massive elliptical galaxies harbor large amounts of hot gas (T ≳ 106 K) in their interstellar medium (ISM) but are typically quiescent in star formation. The jets of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) inject energy into the ISM, which offsets its radiative losses and keeps it hot. SNe Ia deposit their energy locally within the galaxy compared to the larger few ×10 kiloparsec-scale AGN jets. In this study, we perform high-resolution (5123) hydrodynamic simulations of a local (1 kpc3) density-stratified patch of the ISM of massive galaxies. We include radiative cooling and shell-averaged volume heating, as well as randomly exploding SN Ia. We study the effect of different fractions of supernova (SN) heating (with respect to the net cooling rate), different initial ISM density/entropy (which controls the growth time tti of the thermal instability), and different degrees of stratification (which affect the freefall time tff). We find that SNe Ia drive predominantly compressive turbulence in the ISM with a velocity dispersion of σv up to 40 km s−1 and logarithmic density dispersion of σs ∼ 0.2–0.4. These fluctuations trigger multiphase condensation in regions of the ISM, where , in agreement with theoretical expectations that large density fluctuations efficiently trigger multiphase gas formation. Since the SN Ia rate is not self-adjusting, when the net cooling drops below the net heating rate, SNe Ia drive a hot wind which sweeps out most of the mass in our local model. Global simulations are required to assess the ultimate fate of this gas.

Quasars are bright and unobscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) thought to be powered by the accretion of matter around supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. The temporal variability of a quasar’s brightness contains valuable information about its physical properties. The UV/optical variability is thought to be a stochastic process, often represented as a damped random walk described by a stochastic differential equation (SDE). Upcoming wide-field telescopes such as the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) are expected to observe tens of millions of AGN in multiple filters over a ten year period, so there is a need for efficient and automated modeling techniques that can handle the large volume of data. Latent SDEs are machine learning models well suited for modeling quasar variability, as they can explicitly capture the underlying stochastic dynamics. In this work, we adapt latent SDEs to jointly reconstruct multivariate quasar light curves and infer their physical properties such as the black hole mass, inclination angle, and temperature slope. Our model is trained on realistic simulations of LSST ten year quasar light curves, and we demonstrate its ability to reconstruct quasar light curves even in the presence of long seasonal gaps and irregular sampling across different bands, outperforming a multioutput Gaussian process regression baseline. Our method has the potential to provide a deeper understanding of the physical properties of quasars and is applicable to a wide range of other multivariate time series with missing data and irregular sampling.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章利用JWST NIRSpec的新光谱数据研究了NGC 7469这个近距离的活跃星系，重点关注了活跃星系核（AGN）在周核区气体的激发和动力学作用。研究发现AGN的光电离作用占据着星系中心300 pc范围内的主要地位，同时还发现了少许区域的冲击激发迹象，可能与紧凑的射电喷流有关。此外，气体的速度场和速度离散度图显示了复杂的气体运动学特征，旋转是主要的特征，但还发现了与气体流入方向一致的非圆形运动。研究还发现了气体的流入速率远超AGN的吸积速率，并且紧凑的射电喷流有足够的能量来推动高度电离的流出气体。因此，NGC 7469内的气体流入和流出处于自我调节的供给-反馈过程中，射电喷流的贡献有助于推动流出气体。 <div>
We present new JWST NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data for the luminous infrared galaxy NGC 7469, a nearby (70.6 Mpc) active galaxy with a Seyfert 1.5 nucleus that drives a highly ionized gas outflow and a prominent nuclear star-forming ring. Using the superb sensitivity and high spatial resolution of the JWST instrument NIRSpec IFS, we investigate the role of the Seyfert nucleus in the excitation and dynamics of the circumnuclear gas. Our analysis focuses on the [Fe ii], H2, and hydrogen recombination lines that trace the radiation/shocked-excited molecular and ionized interstellar medium around the active galactic nucleus (AGN). We investigate gas excitation through H2/Brγ and [Fe ii]/Paβ emission line ratios and find that photoionization by the AGN dominates within the central 300 pc of the galaxy except in a small region that shows signatures of shock-heated gas; these shock-heated regions are likely associated with a compact radio jet. In addition, the velocity field and velocity dispersion maps reveal complex gas kinematics. Rotation is the dominant feature, but we also identify noncircular motions consistent with gas inflows as traced by the velocity residuals and the spiral pattern in the Paα velocity dispersion map. The inflow is 2 orders of magnitude higher than the AGN accretion rate. The compact nuclear radio jet has enough power to drive the highly ionized outflow. This scenario suggests that the inflow and outflow are in a self-regulating feeding–feedback process, with a contribution from the radio jet helping to drive the outflow.

总结: 本研究通过对小麦哲伦云中X射线暂现星SXP 18.3的观测，首次成功地演示了使用卡尔曼滤波器分析来唯一测量磁偶极矩μ。传统方法无法唯一推断μ，但通过卡尔曼滤波器分析可以避免辐射效率η0的问题。此外，研究还得出了时间分辨率的隐含状态变量估计，如质量吸积率和磁盘-磁层边界处的最大应力。这一成功的演示证实了卡尔曼滤波器分析可用于将来研究小麦哲伦云和其他地方的吸积驱动脉冲星群体的磁矩和盘-磁层物理学。 <div>
The magnetic dipole moment μ of an accretion-powered pulsar in magnetocentrifugal equilibrium cannot be inferred uniquely from time-averaged pulse period and aperiodic X-ray flux data, because the radiative efficiency η0 of the accretion is unknown, as are the mass, radius, and distance of the star. The degeneracy associated with the radiative efficiency is circumvented if fluctuations of the pulse period and aperiodic X-ray flux are tracked with a Kalman filter, whereupon μ can be measured uniquely up to the uncertainties in the mass, radius, and distance. Here, the Kalman filter analysis is demonstrated successfully in practice for the first time on Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations of the X-ray transient SXP 18.3 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), which is monitored regularly. The analysis yields and , compared to as inferred traditionally from time-averaged data assuming η0 = 1. The analysis also yields time-resolved estimates of two hidden state variables, the mass accretion rate and the Maxwell stress at the disk–magnetosphere boundary. The success of the demonstration confirms that the Kalman filter analysis can be applied in the future to study the magnetic moments and disk–magnetosphere physics of accretion-powered pulsar populations in the SMC and elsewhere.

总结: 
本文介绍了使用图神经网络模型来准确预测星系的关键属性，包括恒星质量、 g − r 颜色、星形成速率、气体质量、恒星金属丰度和气体金属丰度，仅基于从暗物质模拟中提取的星系群的性质。在IllustrisTNG项目的TNG300模拟的测试中，我们的模型能够准确地恢复星系的巴氏质量，覆盖广泛的红移范围（z=0-5），对于所有恒星质量大于10^9M⊙的星系及其祖先，相较于现有技术有显著提高。此外，我们还展示了我们的方法在理解IllustrisTNG星系形成模型的影响方面取得了实质性进展。<br /><br /> <div>
Galaxies play a key role in our endeavor to understand how structure formation proceeds in the Universe. For any precision study of cosmology or galaxy formation, there is a strong demand for huge sets of realistic mock galaxy catalogs, spanning cosmologically significant volumes. For such a daunting task, methods that can produce a direct mapping between dark matter halos from dark matter-only simulations and galaxies are strongly preferred, as producing mocks from full-fledged hydrodynamical simulations or semi-analytical models is too expensive. Here, we present a graph-neural-network-based model that is able to accurately predict key properties of galaxies such as stellar mass, g − r color, star formation rate, gas mass, stellar metallicity, and gas metallicity, purely from dark matter properties extracted from halos along the full assembly history of the galaxies. Tests based on the TNG300 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project show that our model can recover the baryonic properties of galaxies to high accuracy, over a wide redshift range (z = 0–5), for all galaxies with stellar masses more massive than 109M⊙ and their progenitors, with strong improvements over the state-of-the-art methods. We further show that our method makes substantial strides toward providing an understanding of the implications of the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model.

Recent Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations have revealed an increasing number of compact protostellar disks with radii of less than a few tens of astronomical units and that young Class 0/I objects have an intrinsic size diversity. To deepen our understanding of the origin of such tiny disks, we have performed highest-resolution configuration observations with ALMA at a beam size of ∼0.″03 (4 au) on the very low-luminosity Class 0 protostar embedded in the Taurus dense core MC 27/L1521F. The 1.3 mm continuum measurement successfully resolved a tiny, faint (∼1 mJy) disk with a major axis length of ∼10 au, one of the smallest examples in the ALMA protostellar studies. In addition, we detected spike-like components in the northeastern direction at the disk edge. Gravitational instability or other fragmentation mechanisms cannot explain the structures, given the central stellar mass of ∼0.2 M⊙ and the disk mass of ≳10−4M⊙. Instead, we propose that these small spike structures were formed by a recent dynamic magnetic flux transport event due to interchange instability that would be favorable to occur if the parental core has a strong magnetic field. The presence of complex arc-like structures on a larger (∼2000 au) scale in the same direction as the spike structures suggests that the event was not single. Such episodic, dynamical events may play an important role in maintaining the compact nature of the protostellar disk in the complex gas envelope during the main accretion phase.

总结: 本文研究了银河系中多尺度的热气体温度结构。通过分析XMM-Newton存档中的O vii、O viii和Fe-L带发射特征，定义了两个温度示踪器O87和FeO，并发现单一温度碰撞电离模型无法解释这两个比值。研究还展现了银河系中三个大尺度的热气体特征：银河中心的eROSITA气泡、盘状结构和晕轮。通过自相关函数和交叉相关函数的分析，发现热气体存在着与星形成区域或超新星遗迹相关的X射线气泡，同时还展现了热气体与紫外线检测到的温暖气体之间的有趣反相关关系。 <div>
This paper presents the multiscale temperature structures in the Milky Way (MW) hot gas, as part of the XMM-Newton Line Emission Analysis Program, surveying the O vii, O viii, and Fe-L band emission features in the XMM-Newton archive. In particular, we define two temperature tracers, IOVIII/IOVII (O87) and IFeL/(IOVII + IOVIII) (FeO). These two ratios cannot be explained simultaneously using single-temperature collisional ionization models, which indicates the need for multitemperature structures in hot gas. In addition, we show three large-scale features in the hot gas: the eROSITA bubbles around the Galactic center (GC), the disk, and the halo. In the eROSITA bubbles, the observed line ratios can be explained by a log-normal temperature distribution with a median of and a scatter of σT ≈ 0.2 dex. Beyond the bubbles, the line ratio dependence on the Galactic latitude suggests higher temperatures around the midplane of the MW disk. The scale height of the temperature variation is estimated to be ≈2 kpc assuming an average distance of 5 kpc for the hot gas. The halo component is characterized by the dependence on the distance to the GC, showing a temperature decline from to 5.8. Furthermore, we extract the autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions to investigate the small-scale structures. O87 and FeO ratios show a consistent autocorrelation scale of ≈5° (i.e., ≈400 pc at 5 kpc), which is consistent with the expected physical sizes of X-ray bubbles associated with star-forming regions or supernova remnants. Finally, we examine the cross-correlation between the hot and UV-detected warm gas and show an intriguing anticorrelation.

<title>COSMOS-Web: Intrinsically Luminous z ≳ 10 Galaxy Candidates Test Early Stellar Mass Assembly</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the discovery of 15 exceptionally luminous 10 ≲ z ≲ 14 candidate galaxies discovered in the first 0.28 deg2 of JWST/NIRCam imaging from the COSMOS-Web survey. These sources span rest-frame UV magnitudes of −20.5 > MUV > −22, and thus constitute the most intrinsically luminous z ≳ 10 candidates identified by JWST to date. Selected via NIRCam imaging, deep ground-based observations corroborate their detection and help significantly constrain their photometric redshifts. We analyze their spectral energy distributions using multiple open-source codes and evaluate the probability of low-redshift solutions; we conclude that 12/15 (80%) are likely genuine z ≳ 10 sources and 3/15 (20%) likely low-redshift contaminants. Three of our z ∼ 12 candidates push the limits of early stellar mass assembly: they have estimated stellar masses ∼ 5 × 109M⊙, implying an effective stellar baryon fraction of ϵ⋆ ∼ 0.2−0.5, where ϵ⋆ ≡ M⋆/(fbMhalo). The assembly of such stellar reservoirs is made possible due to rapid, burst-driven star formation on timescales < 100 Myr where the star formation rate may far outpace the growth of the underlying dark matter halos. This is supported by the similar volume densities inferred for M⋆ ∼ 1010M⊙ galaxies relative to M⋆ ∼ 109M⊙—both about 10−6 Mpc−3—implying they live in halos of comparable mass. At such high redshifts, the duty cycle for starbursts would be of order unity, which could cause the observed change in the shape of the UV luminosity function from a double power law to a Schechter function at z ≈ 8. Spectroscopic redshift confirmation and ensuing constraints of their masses will be critical to understand how, and if, such early massive galaxies push the limits of galaxy formation in the Lambda cold dark matter paradigm.

总结: 该研究调查了原始大气中X射线和紫外光诱导光蒸发的扩散极限。研究发现，由于受到粒子碰撞较少的顶层大气控制，质量损失导致的成分分馏比目前认为的更为显著。顶层大气中的这种分馏导致形成向下延伸的成分梯度。质量流出最终达到稳定状态，其中氢损失受到扩散限制。我们推导了扩散限制质量流失速率和交叉质量的新的解析表达式。 <div>
Photoevaporation is thought to play an important role in early planetary evolution. In this study, we investigate the diffusion limit of X-ray- and ultraviolet-induced photoevaporation in primordial atmospheres. We find that compositional fractionation resulting from mass loss is more significant than currently recognized, because it is controlled by the conditions at the top of the atmosphere, where particle collisions are less frequent. Such fractionation at the top of the atmosphere develops a compositional gradient that extends downward. The mass outflow eventually reaches a steady state in which the hydrogen loss is diffusion-limited. We derive new analytic expressions for the diffusion-limited mass-loss rate and the crossover mass.

<br /><br />
这篇文章讨论了绕爆发变星AM Herculis（AM Her）和AR Ursae Majoris（AR UMa）的照度测量，以及高速光度测量。AM Her显示出多种高能态，经常在它们之间进行转换。低能态AR UMa的TESS光度测量没有显示出吸积的证据，而麦克唐纳2.1米望远镜捕捉到AR UMa处于高吸积态。AR UMa的低能态时罗切波溢出被关闭，而AM Her的低能态通常仍然发生吸积。我们推导出AM Her和AR UMa的倾斜角分别为50°和70°。为了对AM Her的高能态光变曲线进行建模，我们采用了自组织图光变分类方案，以建立常见的吸积结构。然后，轨道辐射特性可用于在白矮星表面上生产发射区域地图。AM Her的吸积几何结构最符合多极场结构。AR UMa的高能态具有随机吸积耀斑，我们将其归因于通过内拉格朗日点L1的磁碰撞质量转移。为了考虑这种可能性，我们检查了两颗恒星的磁性，并认为L1附近的局部磁场可以引发短暂的吸积事件，并影响AM Her和AR UMa之间的高低能态转换。特别是，AR UMa的默认状态是低能态，而AM Her和大多数其他的活跃的爆发变星的默认状态是高能态。
<br /><br />总结: TESS卫星对AM Her和AR UMa进行了照度测量，并发现它们在高、低能态之间频繁转换。AR UMa的低能态下没有吸积迹象，但在高能态下由麦克唐纳2.1米望远镜观测到了强吸积。AM Her和AR UMa的倾斜角分别为50°和70°。AM Her的吸积几何结构最符合多极场结构，而AR UMa的高能态表现出随机吸积耀斑，磁碰撞质量转移可能导致这种现象。 <div>
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry of the polars AM Herculis (AM Her) and AR Ursae Majoris (AR UMa) is presented, along with high-speed photometry. AM Her shows a variety of high states with frequent transitions between them. TESS photometry of AR UMa in the low state reveals no evidence of accretion, while the McDonald 2.1 m telescope caught AR UMa in its high accretion state. Roche-lobe overflow is shut off during low states of AR UMa, while accretion often still takes place during low states of AM Her. We derive inclinations of 50° and 70° for AM Her and AR UMa respectively. To model the high-state light curves of AM Her, we employ a self-organized map light-curve classification scheme to establish common accretion configurations. The cyclotron radiation properties then allow the production of emission region maps on the surface of the white dwarf. The accretion geometry of AM Her is most consistent with a multipolar field structure. The high-state photometry of AR UMa has stochastic accretion flaring, which we attribute to magnetically buffeted mass transfer through the inner Lagrangian point L1. To consider this possibility, we examine the magnetism of both stars and argue that the local magnetic field near L1 can initiate short-lived accretion events and affect transitions between high and low accretion states in both AM Her and AR UMa. In particular, AR UMa has the low state as its default, while AM Her and most other active polars are in the high state by default.

<div> BCDs,星团群落,星系,持续恒定的星形成,星系演化
总结:<br /><br />这项研究使用哈勃太空望远镜的高分辨率图像对ESO185-IG13、ESO338-IG04和Haro11三个蓝色紧凑矮星系(BCD)的星团群落进行了研究，首次探索了100百万年之前的星团群落。BCDs据信会在长期的寂静期之后经历强烈的星形成爆发，但关于这些爆发的时间、频率、持续时间和强度以及它们的星形成历史知之甚少。研究发现，被研究的三个星系中的星团群落分布色彩各异，因此具有独特的星团群落和星形成历史。通过假设星团质量函数的归一化与宿主星系的星形成率之间的关联，研究人员建立了基于星团的星形成历史，发现只有Haro11目前正经历着一次爆发，而ESO185在10到40百万年前曾经历了增强的星形成，ESO338在过去几十亿年中的星形成历史相对持续稳定。这些发现表明，并非所有BCDs都在目前经历星形成爆发，并且一些星系在过去几十亿年中一直以相当稳定的速率形成星团和星系（变化幅度大约为2-3倍）。这一情景类似于矮星系和矮星爆星系的星形成历史，它们的星形成率比BCDs低10-1000倍。 <div>
We present a new study of the cluster populations in the blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCD) ESO185-IG13, ESO338-IG04, and Haro11, based on new and archival high-resolution images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, and the first to probe the populations older than ≈100 Myr. BCDs are believed to experience intense bursts of star formation (including at the present day) after long periods of quiescence, but little is known about the timing, frequency, duration, and strength of these bursts or about their star formation histories in general. We find that the cluster population in each of the three galaxies studied here has its own unique distribution of colors and hence a unique cluster and star formation history. From an assumed correlation between the normalization of the cluster mass function and the star formation rate of the host galaxy, we construct cluster-based star formation histories over the past ≈few × Gyr and find that only Haro11 is currently experiencing a burst (≈factor of 10 increase in the rate of star formation for the last ≈20 Myr), whereas ESO185 experienced enhanced star formation (by a factor ≈4) between 10 and 40 Myr ago, and ESO338 has had a fairly constant SFH over the past few Gyr. These findings indicate that not all BCDs are experiencing a burst of star formation at the present day, and that some have been forming stars and clusters at a fairly steady rate (within a factor of ≈2–3) over the past few Gyr. This scenario is similar to the histories of dwarf irregular and dwarf starburst galaxies, which have star formation rates that are 10–1000 times lower than those in BCDs.

The nearby type II supernova, SN 2023ixf in M101 exhibits signatures of early time interaction with circumstellar material in the first week postexplosion. This material may be the consequence of prior mass loss suffered by the progenitor, which possibly manifested in the form of a detectable presupernova outburst. We present an analysis of long-baseline preexplosion photometric data in the g, w, r, i, z, and y filters from Pan-STARRS as part of the Young Supernova Experiment, spanning ∼5000 days. We find no significant detections in the Pan-STARRS preexplosion light curves. We train a multilayer perceptron neural network to classify presupernova outbursts. We find no evidence of eruptive presupernova activity to a limiting absolute magnitude of −7 mag. The limiting magnitudes from the full set of gwrizy (average absolute magnitude ≈ −8 mag) data are consistent with previous preexplosion studies. We use deep photometry from the literature to constrain the progenitor of SN 2023ixf, finding that these data are consistent with a dusty red supergiant progenitor with luminosity ≈ 5.12 and temperature ≈ 3950 K, corresponding to a mass of 14–20 M⊙.

We study solar wind turbulence anisotropy in the inertial and energy-containing ranges in the inbound and outbound directions during encounters 1–9 by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) for distances between ∼21 and 65 R⊙. Using the Adhikari et al. approach, we derive theoretical equations to calculate the ratio between the 2D and slab fluctuating magnetic energy, fluctuating kinetic energy, and the outward/inward Elsässer energy in the inertial range. For this, in the energy-containing range, we assume a wavenumber k−1 power law. In the inertial range, for the magnetic field fluctuations and the outward/inward Elsässer energy, we consider that (i) both 2D and slab fluctuations follow a power law of k−5/3, and (ii) the 2D and slab fluctuations follow the power laws with k−5/3 and k−3/2, respectively. For the velocity fluctuations, we assume that both the 2D and slab components follow a k−3/2 power law. We compare the theoretical results of the variance anisotropy in the inertial range with the derived observational values measured by PSP, and find that the energy density of 2D fluctuations is larger than that of the slab fluctuations. The theoretical variance anisotropy in the inertial range relating to the k−5/3 and k−3/2 power laws between 2D and slab turbulence exhibits a smaller value in comparison to assuming the same power law k−5/3 between 2D and slab turbulence. Finally, the observed turbulence energy measured by PSP in the energy-containing range is found to be similar to the theoretical result of a nearly incompressible/slab turbulence description.

总结：<br />
本文提出了一种基于块矩阵乘法规则的光谱展宽函数（BF）的扩展形式，称为二进制BF（BBF）。该方法可以使用两个光谱模板为二进制星系统的各个组成部分产生分解的BF，并用于推导单个组分的精确旋转剖面和径向速度。通过对模拟光谱和实际观测光谱进行测试，证明了该方法在光谱双星系统上是可行的，即使两个恒星组分的光谱线严重重叠。我们还通过模拟实施了使用BBF进行“勾画”（成像）食双星行星的能力。此外，我们还讨论了实施问题，例如BBF随偏差模板的变化，BBF的利弊以及不适用该方法的情况。 <div>
We propose an extended formalism for the spectral broadening function (BF) based on the multiplication rule of block matrices. The formalism, which we named the binary BF (BBF), can produce decomposed BFs for individual components of a binary star system by using two spectral templates. The decomposed BFs can be used to derive precise rotational profiles and radial velocities for individual components. We test the BBF on simulated spectra and actual observational spectra to show that the method is feasible on spectroscopic binaries, even when the spectral lines of two stellar components are heavily blended. To demonstrate the capability of the method, we conduct a simulation of “sketching” (imaging) a transiting circumbinary exoplanet using the BBF. We also discuss issues of implementation such as the variation of BBF with biased templates, the pros and cons of BBF, and cases when the method is not applicable.

If a Galactic core-collapse supernova explosion occurs in the future, it will be critical to rapidly alert the community to the direction of the supernova by utilizing neutrino signals in order to enable the initiation of follow-up optical observations. In addition, there is anticipation that observation of the diffuse supernova neutrino background will yield discoveries in the near future, given that experimental upper limits are approaching theoretical predictions. We have developed a new supernova event simulator for water Cherenkov neutrino detectors, such as the highly sensitive Super-Kamiokande. This simulator calculates the neutrino interaction in water for two simulation purposes, individual core-collapse supernova bursts and diffuse supernova neutrino background. Based on this simulator, we can evaluate the precision in determining the location of supernovae and estimate the expected number of events related to the diffuse supernova neutrino background in Super-Kamiokande. In this paper, we describe the basic structure of the simulator and its demonstration.

<div> Type Ia SN, supernova siblings, near-infrared, light curves, calibration
<br /><br />总结:
本研究首次使用仅近红外数据对超新星同胞进行分析。通过对已发表的近红外光度数据进行校准，并使用SALT3-NIR和SNooPy模型拟合光度曲线，发现同胞之间绝对视星等差异中位数为0.248和0.186等级。通过模拟实验估计了这些差异的不确定性，并发现统计上，在近红外波段不存在内在散射的可能性。与仅使用光学数据相比，同一组超新星同胞之间的绝对视星等差异中位数为0.177等级。目前尚不清楚这些结果是由于统计数据不足还是近红外数据质量不佳，这些问题都将在南希·格雷斯·罗曼空间望远镜的使用中得到改善。 <div>
The study of supernova (SN) siblings, supernovae with the same host galaxy, is an important avenue for understanding and measuring the properties of Type Ia SN Ia light curves (LCs). Thus far, sibling analyses have mainly focused on optical LC data. Considering that LCs in the near-infrared (NIR) are expected to be better standard candles than those in the optical, we carry out the first analysis compiling SN siblings with only NIR data. We perform an extensive literature search of all SN siblings and find six sets of siblings with published NIR photometry. We calibrate each set of siblings ensuring they are on homogeneous photometric systems, fit the LCs with the SALT3-NIR and SNooPy models, and find median absolute differences in μ values between siblings of 0.248 and 0.186 mag, respectively. To evaluate the significance of these differences beyond measurement noise, we run simulations that mimic these LCs and provide an estimate for uncertainty on these median absolute differences of ∼0.052 mag, and we find that, statistically, our analysis rules out the nonexistence of intrinsic scatter in the NIR at the 99% level. When comparing the same sets of SN siblings, we observe a median absolute difference in μ values between siblings of 0.177 mag when using optical data alone as compared to 0.186 mag when using NIR data alone. It is unclear if these results may be due to limited statistics or poor quality NIR data, all of which will be improved with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

总结:<br />
本文介绍了使用机器学习模型预测球状星团（GCs）中的中等质量黑洞（IMBHs）的方法及其局限性。作者使用 anchors 方法和 Certifiably Optimal RulE ListS (CORELS) 在解释性和可解释性方面进行了研究，以解决模型的不透明性问题。他们还通过测量模拟数据的真实性来评估模型的偏见，以减轻模型在外推时产生偏见预测的风险。最后，他们将这些分类器应用于真实GC数据，得到了预测的分类、预测置信度、异常值检测等信息。文章提出了对于GC中IMBH的预测方法，并对模型的解释性和泛化能力进行了深入探讨。 <div>
Definitive evidence that globular clusters (GCs) host intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) is elusive. Machine-learning (ML) models trained on GC simulations can in principle predict IMBH host candidates based on observable features. This approach has two limitations: first, an accurate ML model is expected to be a black box due to complexity; second, despite our efforts to simulate GCs realistically, the simulation physics or initial conditions may fail to reflect reality fully. Therefore our training data may be biased, leading to a failure in generalization to observational data. Both the first issue—explainability/interpretability—and the second—out of distribution generalization and fairness—are active areas of research in ML. Here we employ techniques from these fields to address them: we use the anchors method to explain an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifier; we also independently train a natively interpretable model using Certifiably Optimal RulE ListS (CORELS). The resulting model has a clear physical meaning, but loses some performance with respect to XGBoost. We evaluate potential candidates in real data based not only on classifier predictions but also on their similarity to the training data, measured by the likelihood of a kernel density estimation model. This measures the realism of our simulated data and mitigates the risk that our models may produce biased predictions by working in extrapolation. We apply our classifiers to real GCs, obtaining a predicted classification, a measure of the confidence of the prediction, an out-of-distribution flag, a local rule explaining the prediction of XGBoost, and a global rule from CORELS.

<div> 关键词: 磁场演化, 太阳系外行星, 潮汐相互作用, 卫星保留, 辐射功率

总结:
本文研究了气态巨行星与其母恒星和它的系外卫星之间的磁性和潮汐相互作用，重点关注它们的保留情况。首先，讨论了行星地核生成的标度定律，然后根据维里定理构建了行星磁场的演化规律，并发现初始熵对高质量行星的磁场演化非常重要。在估计了星-行星和行星-卫星磁相互作用引起的磁力矩后，发现它可以补偿潮汐力，并绕过动力潮汐响应无效的频谷。对于卫星的保留，考虑了两种情况。在存在环绕行星的盘的情况下，通过比较盘的内外半径，发现磁场过强或与母恒星距离过近的行星很难容纳卫星。在后续的无盘演化中，通过比较行星的减速和卫星迁移的时间尺度，发现几天周期的热木星不太可能保留大型卫星，尽管它们可以被来自被潮汐瓦解的卫星碎片形成的环围绕。与此相反，围绕温暖或寒冷木星形成的卫星可以被保留。最后，我们估算了由星-行星和行星-卫星磁相互作用导致的射电功率和流量密度，并给出了通过FAST探测的上限距离。 <div>
We study the magnetic and tidal interactions of a gas-giant exoplanet with its host star and with its exomoons, and focus on their retention. We briefly revisit the scaling law for planetary dynamo in terms of its mass, radius, and luminosity. Based on the virial theorem, we construct an evolution law for planetary magnetic field and find that its initial entropy is important for the field evolution of a high-mass planet. We estimate the magnetic torques on orbit arising from the star–planet and planet–moon magnetic interactions, and find that it can compensate tidal torques and bypass frequency valleys where dynamical-tide response is ineffective. For exomoon’s retention, we consider two situations. In the presence of a circumplanetary disk (CPD), by comparison between CPD’s inner and outer radii, we find that planets with too strong magnetic fields or too small distance from its host star tend not to host exomoons. During the subsequent CPD-free evolution, we find, by comparison between a planet’s spin-down and a moon’s migration timescales, that hot Jupiters with periods of several days are unlikely to retain large exomoons, albeit they could be surrounded by rings from the debris of tidally disrupted moons. In contrast, moons, if formed around warm or cold Jupiters, can be preserved. Finally, we estimate the radio power and flux density due to the star–planet and planet–moon magnetic interactions and give the upper limit of detection distance by FAST.

该研究对磁星SGR J1935+2154在2022年10月10日爆发后的X射线持续和爆发辐射特性进行了观测。结果显示，持续辐射谱符合吸收黑体加幂律模型，在能量约25 keV时表现良好。在两个观测时段中，黑体温度（kTBB约为0.4 keV）和辐射半径（RBB约为1.9 km）没有显着变化，但幂律参数有轻微变化。此外，观测到X射线脉冲，并得出自旋周期导数为s s−1。这一数值较2014年首次爆发后测得的数值高3.8倍。同时，进行了射电观测未发现任何射电暴或周期性辐射。<br /><br />总结：该研究描述了SGR J1935+2154磁星持续和爆发X射线辐射的特性，观测结果显示持续辐射谱符合黑体加幂律模型，且没有显着变化。此外，还观测到X射线脉冲，并发现自旋周期导数有显著变化。射电观测未发现射电暴或周期性辐射。 <div>
Recently, the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 has garnered attention due to its emission of an extremely luminous radio burst, reminiscent of fast radio bursts (FRBs). SGR J1935+2154 is one of the most active magnetars, displaying flaring events nearly every year, including outbursts as well as short and intermediate bursts. Here, we present our results on the properties of the persistent and bursting X-ray emission from SGR J1935+2154 during the initial weeks following its outburst on 2022 October 10. The source was observed with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR (quasi-)simultaneously during two epochs, separated by ∼5 days. The persistent emission spectrum is well described by an absorbed blackbody plus power-law model up to an energy of ∼25 keV. No significant changes were observed in the blackbody temperature (kTBB ∼ 0.4 keV) and emitting radius (RBB ∼ 1.9 km) between the two epochs. However, we observed a slight variation in the power-law parameters. Moreover, we detected X-ray pulsations in all the data sets and derived a spin-period derivative of s s−1. This is 3.8 times larger than the value measured after the first recorded outburst in 2014. Additionally, we performed quasi-simultaneous radio observations using three 25–32 m class radio telescopes for a total of 92.5 hr to search for FRB-like radio bursts and pulsed emission. However, our analysis did not reveal any radio bursts or periodic emission.

We report multiepoch astrometric very long baseline interferometry observations of the chromospherically active binary HR 1099 (V711 Tau, HD 22468) at six epochs over 63 days using the Very Long Baseline Array at 22.2 GHz. We determined hourly radio positions at each epoch with a positional uncertainty significantly smaller than the component separation. The aggregate radio positions at all epochs define an ellipse in the comoving reference frame with an inclination and longitude of ascending node Ω = 212° ± 22°. The ellipse center is offset from the Third Gaia Celestial Reference Frame position by Δα = , Δδ = mas. All radio centroids are well displaced from the binary center of mass at all epochs, ruling out emission from the interbinary region. We examined the motion of the radio centroids within each epoch by comparing hourly positions over several hours. The measured speeds were not statistically significant for five of the six epochs, with 2σ upper limits in the range 200–1000 km s−1. However, for one flaring epoch, there was a 3σ detection v⊥ = 228 ± 85 km s−1. This speed is comparable to the mean speed of observed coronal mass ejections on the Sun.

总结:<br /><br />本文报告了对SN 2022jox的高频光学和紫外线观测结果。该超新星展现出早期光谱中的高电离闪烁特征，并在爆炸后的几天内消失。SN 2022jox在爆发后约0.75天被Distance Less Than 40 Mpc survey发现，并随后获得了光谱和紫外光度的跟进数据。超新星达到了峰值亮度MV∼−17.3 mag，估计的56Ni质量为0.04 M⊙，这是正常II型超新星的典型数值。对早期光变曲线的建模和光谱中的闪烁特征表明了与周围物质的相互作用，这些物质是由一个具有质量损失率的前体星产生的。SN 2022jox的质量损失率远高于已知II型超新星前体——红超巨星的平静质量损失率，但与类似的核心坍缩超新星的推断值相当，这表明爆炸前几个月或几年内前体星发生了喷发事件或超级风。此外，在大约200天的光谱中还有一些迟发的CSM相互作用的迹象。 <div>
We present high-cadence optical and ultraviolet (UV) observations of the Type II supernova (SN), SN 2022jox which exhibits early spectroscopic high-ionization flash features of H i, He ii, C iv, and N iv that disappear within the first few days after explosion. SN 2022jox was discovered by the Distance Less Than 40 Mpc survey ∼0.75 day after explosion with follow-up spectra and UV photometry obtained within minutes of discovery. The SN reached a peak brightness of MV ∼ −17.3 mag, and has an estimated 56Ni mass of 0.04 M⊙, typical values for normal Type II SNe. The modeling of the early light curve and the strong flash signatures present in the optical spectra indicate interaction with circumstellar material (CSM) created from a progenitor with a mass-loss rate of . There may also be some indication of late-time CSM interaction in the form of an emission line blueward of Hα seen in spectra around 200 days. The mass-loss rate of SN 2022jox is much higher than the values typically associated with quiescent mass loss from red supergiants, the known progenitors of Type II SNe, but is comparable to inferred values from similar core-collapse SNe with flash features, suggesting an eruptive event or a superwind in the progenitor in the months or years before explosion.

总结:<br />
这篇文章研究了弱线类星体的特性，针对活动星系核的光谱能量分布进行了云模拟计算，发现C iv的等效宽度会受到软X射线过剩组分的影响，而具有较大黑洞质量和软X射线较弱的类星体会表现出较弱的紫外线发射线。 <div>
Weak-line quasars (WLQs) are a notable group of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that show unusually weak UV lines even though their optical-UV continuum shapes are similar to those of typical quasars. The physical mechanism for WLQs is an unsolved puzzle in the AGN unified model. We explore the properties of UV emission lines by performing extensive photoionization calculations based on Cloudy simulations with different spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of AGNs. The AGN continua are built from several observational empirical correlations, where the blackbody emission from the cold disk, the power-law emission from the hot corona, and a soft X-ray excess component are considered. We find that the equivalent width (EW) of C iv from our models is systematically lower than observational values if the component of soft X-ray excess is neglected. The EW will increase several times and is roughly consistent with the observations after considering the soft X-ray excess component as constrained from normal type I AGNs. We find that the UV lines are weak for QSOs with quite large black hole mass (e.g., MBH > 109M⊙) and weak soft X-ray emission due to the deficit of ionizing photons. As an example, we present the strength of C iv based on the multiband SEDs for three nearby weak-line AGNs, where the weaker soft X-ray emission normally predicts the weaker lines.

Multiwavelength photometry of brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects provides insight into their atmospheres and cloud layers. We present near-simultaneous J- and Ks-band multiwavelength observations of the highly variable T2.5 planetary-mass object, SIMP J013656.5+093347. We reanalyze observations acquired over a single night in 2015 using a recently developed data reduction pipeline. For the first time, we detect a phase shift between J- and Ks-band light curves, which we measure to be . Previously, phase shifts between near-infrared and mid-infrared observations of this object were detected and attributed to probing different depths of the atmosphere, and thus different cloud layers. Using the Sonora Bobcat models, we expand on this idea to show that at least two different patchy cloud layers must be present to explain the measured phase shift. Our results are generally consistent with recent atmospheric retrievals of this object and other similar L/T transition objects.

<br /><br />总结: 
Ganymede的微型磁层与Jovian等离子体流相互作用产生Alfvénic power，其变化周期与Ganymede极光足迹发出功率周期一致。Alfvénic power的大小与Ganymede所处位置的Jovian等离子体片区的By分量大小相关。 <div>
Alfvénic power is generated through the interaction between the mini-magnetosphere of Ganymede and the corotating flow of the Jovian plasma, contributing to the formation of the Ganymede auroral footprint at Jupiter’s ionosphere. Using a three-dimensional, high-resolution global magnetohydrodynamic model of the Ganymede magnetosphere, we investigate the temporal variations of the Alfvénic power generated in the mini-magnetosphere of the moon under steady-state upstream conditions. Results show that (1) the Alfvénic power caused by the intermittent magnetic reconnections and the Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities is quasiperiodic, varying over time with the periods about 71–333 s, which are consistent with the 100 s timescale periodicities of the Ganymede footprint's emitted power; and (2) the magnitude of the Alfvénic power is smaller when Ganymede is inside the Jovian plasma sheet where the By component is smaller, and larger when the moon is outside the plasma sheet where the By component is larger.

Recent observational and simulation studies have revealed that ambipolar diffusion is an important phenomenon in the outer regions of a protoplanetary disk (PPD). However, numerous simulation studies have found that ambipolar diffusion suppresses the turbulence caused by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in these regions of a PPD. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of ambipolar diffusion on the Rossby wave instability (RWI) at large radii of a PPD. To accomplish this, we examine the occurrence of the RWI in a PPD threaded by the magnetic field in the presence of ambipolar diffusion. Additionally, we scale the ambipolar diffusivity with respect to both the toroidal magnetic field and an important parameter known as the Elsässer number. We obtain the growth rate of unstable RWI modes in the outer regions of a PPD using linear perturbation analysis. In our nonaxisymmetric perturbation analysis, we find that the amplitude of the toroidal field oscillates in various modes for small values of the Elsässer numbers. For small Elsässer numbers, the growth rate of unstable modes associated with the RWI decreases. In other words, ambipolar diffusion suppresses the perturbation caused by the RWI. This effect is similar to the effect of ambipolar diffusion on the MRI. In contrast to the MRI, where there is a range around 1 for the Elsässer numbers, the existence of ambipolar diffusion supports the occurrence of RWI. Finally, we compare our findings with those of simulation studies to emphasize the importance of RWI in the outer regions of a PPD.

<title>Prospects of Identifying Hierarchical Triple Mergers for the Third-generation Ground-based Detectors</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A hierarchical triple merger (HTM) constitutes a type of event in which two successive black hole (BH) mergers occur sequentially within the observational window of gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, which has an important role in testing general relativity and studying BH population. In this work, we conduct an analysis to determine the feasibility of identifying HTMs from a large GW event catalog using third-generation ground-based GW detectors. By comparing the Bhattacharyya coefficient that measures the overlap between the posterior distributions of the remnant and progenitor BH parameters, we find that the overlap between the event pair can serve as a preliminary filter, which balances between computational demand and the probability of false alarms. Following this initial, time-efficient, yet less accurate screening, a subset of potential HTM candidates will be retained. These candidates will subsequently be subjected to a more precise, albeit time-intensive, method of joint parameter estimation for verification. Ultimately, this process will enable us to robustly identify HTMs.

The thorium and six second-peak r-process element (56 ≤ Z ≤ 72) abundances are determined for the α-poor star LAMOST J1124+4535 based on a high-resolution spectrum obtained with the High Dispersion Spectrograph on the Subaru Telescope. The age of J1124+4535 is 11.3 ± 4.4 Gyr using thorium and other r-process element abundances. J1124+4535 is confirmed to be a Galactic halo metal-poor ([Fe/H] = −1.27 ± 0.1) star with extreme r-process element overabundance ([Eu/Fe] = 1.13 ± 0.08) and α element deficiency ([Mg/Fe] = −0.31 ± 0.09) by the LAMOST-Subaru project. Along with the subsolar α-to-iron ratios (e.g., [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe]), the relatively low abundances of Na, Cr, Ni, and Zn in J1124+4535 show a significant departure from the general trends of the Galactic halo but are in good agreement with those of dwarf galaxies. The chemical abundances and kinematics of J1124+4535 suggest it was formed in the late stage of star formation in a dwarf galaxy that has been disrupted by the Milky Way. The star formation of its progenitor dwarf galaxy lasted more than 2 Gyr and has been affected by a rare r-process event before the occurrence of accretion event.

<title>The Orbit of NGC 5907 ULX-1</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report on the orbit of the binary system powering the most extreme ultraluminous X-ray pulsar known to date: NGC 5907 ULX-1 (hereafter ULX1). ULX1 has been the target of a substantial multi-instrument campaign, mainly in the X-ray band, but no clear counterparts are known in other bands. Although ULX1 is highly variable and pulsations can be transient (regardless of the source flux), the timing data collected so far allow us to investigate the orbit of this system. We find an orbital period and a projected semi-axis . The most likely ephemeris is Porb = 5.6585(6) days, A1 = 3.1(4) lt-s, and the epoch of ascending nodes passage is Tasc = 57751.37(5) MJD. However, there are six similar solutions acceptable within 3σ. We find further indications that ULX1 is a high-mass X-ray binary. This implies that we are observing its orbit face on, with an inclination <5°.

<title>Morphological Evolution of Disk Galaxies and Their Concentration, Asymmetry, and Clumpiness (CAS) Properties in Simulations across Toomre’s Q Parameter</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the morphological and structural evolution of disk galaxies in simulations for a wide range of Toomre’s Q parameters. In addition to the inspection of conventional bar modes, we compute the concentration, asymmetry, and clumpiness (CAS) parameters to enlarge the understanding of the galaxy evolution. These parameters are widely employed to analyze the light distribution of the observed galaxies, but the adaptation to numerical simulations is not much considered. While the bar formation takes place in a considerable range of Q around 1, barred galaxies originating from Q > 1 and Q < 1 disks yield CAS values that differ significantly. Disks starting with Q < 1 develop clumps due to local gravitational instabilities along with the bar, and these clumps play a central role in enhancing the CAS values. This process is absent in the Q > 1 counterparts in which the evolution is dominated by linearly unstable two-armed modes that lead to lower CAS values. Likewise, unbarred galaxies that are obtainable from disks with Q far below and far above 1 exhibit greatly different CAS magnitudes. It turns out that the CAS parameters can serve as indicators of the initial kinematical state and the evolution history of a disk of any morphology. In addition, we find an alternative mechanism of the formation of the lopsided barred galaxy when Q ≲ 1. Bars that evolve in the midst of the clumps can spontaneously become lopsided at the end.

<div> Parker Solar Probe, observations, reconnection exhausts, current sheets, plasma

总结:<br />
Parker Solar Probe在接触4-11期间分析了极径小于0.26天文单位的观测数据，发现在当前表面（current sheets, CSs）中存在重新连接排气。这些重新连接排气在各种径向距离上几乎都有相同的概率出现，但在典型的慢速风区具有Tp < 0.80 MK的平静等离子体中更为常见。高Tp > 0.80 MK的快速风区中很少支持重新连接排气现象。观测还显示了在几个CSs中存在的局部温度梯度，其中局部闭合磁场线上的高Tp等离子体和局部开放磁场线上的低Tp等离子体为一种交换型重新连接。CS的几何形状分析直接支持了X线平分磁场旋转θ角的性质，无论磁场和等离子体是否对称，以最大化重新连接速率和可用磁能量。CS正常宽度dcs的分布表明，通过分层分叉CS的嵌套层次多尺度重新连接过程可能是观察到的中位数dcs ∼ 1000 km之上的幂律分布的导致原因，而在此中位数以下的离子动能耗散尺度则存在指数型dcs分布。磁场剪切θ角在极径小于0.26天文单位和1天文单位时基本相同，中位数在太阳附近是θ ∼ 55°，而在1天文单位附近是θ ∼ 65°。相比之下，切向流剪切分布在太阳附近和远离太阳的地方是不同的。在太阳附近存在双峰切向流剪切角分布，有较强的切向流剪切角大小。这种分布会随着径向距离的增加而改变，变成了相对平坦的较弱的流切向流剪切角的分布。 <div>
Parker Solar Probe observations are analyzed for the presence of reconnection exhausts across current sheets (CSs) within R < 0.26 au during encounters 4–11. Exhausts are observed with nearly equal probability at all radial distances with a preference for quiescent Tp < 0.80 MK plasmas typical of a slow-wind regime. High Tp > 0.80 MK plasmas of a fast wind characterized by significant transverse fluctuations rarely support exhausts irrespective of the CS width. Exhaust observations demonstrate the presence of local temperature gradients across several CSs with a higher-Tp plasma on locally closed fields and a lower-Tp plasma on locally open field lines for an interchange-type reconnection. A CS geometry analysis directly supports the property that X-lines bisect the magnetic field rotation θ-angle, whether the fields and plasmas are asymmetric or not, to maximize reconnection rates and available magnetic energy. The CS normal width dcs distributions suggest that a multiscale reconnection process through nested layers of bifurcated CSs may be responsible for observed power-law distributions beyond the median dcs ∼ 1000 km with an exponential dcs distribution present for ion kinetic dissipation scales below this median. Magnetic field shear θ-angles are essentially identical at R < 0.26 and 1 au with medians at θ ∼ 55° near the Sun and θ ∼ 65° at 1 au. In contrast, the tangential flow shear distributions are different near and far from the Sun. A bimodal flow shear angle distribution is present near the Sun with strong shear flow magnitudes. This distribution is modified with radial distance toward a relatively flat distribution of weaker flow shear magnitudes.

<br /><br />
总结:
最近的IXPE观测支持了激波模型对X射线发射的解释，但报告了与激波模型先前理论预期相比较低的极化程度。通过重新考虑激波产生的磁场在不同方向上的分布，可以描述射流中X射线和无线电发射的极化特性，并发现在低频发射中磁场的贡献显著。同时，理赫特迈尔—梅施科夫不稳定性产生的磁场对低频发射的极化特性可能有显著影响。 <div>
Recent Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observations of blazars tend to support the shock model for the X-ray emission, but report a low degree of polarization (Π ∼ 10%) in X-rays compared with the previous theoretical expectations in the shock model. In order to reconcile the theoretical expectations with observations, we revisit the polarization of the shock emission by considering different types of directions in the distribution of the shock-generated magnetic fields (sgMFs). Here, with along the shock normal direction is used to describe the direction in the distribution of sgMFs in the shock comoving frame. It is found that the polarization in the X-ray and radio emission for a general jet in blazars can be described as and , respectively. Correspondingly, one can have ζsg ∼ 1−1.5 according to IXPE observations. Besides the sgMFs, the magnetic fields generated by the Richtmyer–Meshkov instability (RMI) (rmMFs) are supposed to be present in the jets. The direction of the rmMFs is mainly distributed along the shock normal in the simulations and thus is adopted to describe the direction of the distribution in rmMFs. We find that rmMFs are likely to significantly affect the polarization properties at low-frequency emission, especially when the sgMFs decay rapidly. Based on contemporaneous radio and X-ray observations, we find that the emission of electrons in rmMFs makes a significant contribution to the low-frequency emission and the ordered background magnetic fields can be neglected.

<div> 关键词: NGC 4138, PAH emission, AGN, Spitzer,星系

总结:
NGC 4138是一个低光度活动星系核(AGN)宿主，研究了其内部的PAH辐射发射。研究发现，星系内的PAH带比值随半径变化显著。使用新的PAH光谱模型，研究了AGN对PAH颗粒大小分布的影响。独立模拟了NGC 4138内部辐射场的变化，并用模型预测了PAH发射光谱的相关变化。结果表明，星火环中的星光混合度对PAH带比值的趋势有显著影响，辐射模型预测了这些趋势的形状。AGN的小颗粒截断和PAH电离分数的变化可能解释了较短波段的行为，但无法解释较长波段的情况。另外，研究发现在离中心约270pc的地方，PAH带比值略有增加，这表明AGN可能直接影响该区域的PAH发射。<br /><br /> <div>
We present a focused study of radially resolved varying PAH emission in the low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN)-host NGC 4138 using deep Spitzer/infrared spectrograph spectral maps. Using new model PAH spectra, we investigate whether these variations could be associated with changes to the PAH grain size distribution due to photodestruction by the AGN. Separately, we model the effects of the varying radiation field within NGC 4138, and we use this model to predict the corresponding changes in the PAH emission spectrum. We find that PAH band ratios are strongly variable with radius in this galaxy with short-to-long wavelength band ratios peaking in the starburst ring. The changing mix of starlight appears to have a considerable effect on the trends in these band ratios, and our radiation model predicts the shapes of these trends. However, the amplitude of observed variation is ∼2.5 × larger than predicted for some ratios. A cutoff of small grains in the PAH size distribution, as has been suggested for AGN, together with changes in PAH ionization fraction could explain the behavior of the shorter bands, but this model fails to reproduce longer band behaviors. Additionally, we find that short-to-long wavelength PAH band ratios increase slightly within ∼270 pc of the center, suggesting that the AGN may directly influence PAH emission there.

总结: 
研究以美国超长基线阵列（VLBA）观测的夸萨尔1604+159为对象，对其视差尺度下的总强度、谱指数、线偏振和旋转测度分布进行了分析。在2002年以5.0、8.4和15.4 GHz和2020年以4.6、5.1、6.0、7.8、12.2、15.2和43.9 GHz进行了观测。研究发现了核心-喷流结构，喷流延伸至距核心约25mas的范围。通过线偏振分布，将源结构划分为中央区和喷流区，发现喷流区的线偏振随时间变化。核心偏移指数kr表明核心在2002年接近均衡状态，而2020年已偏离。在核心检测到了横向RM梯度，为螺旋磁场的证据。通过15 GHz观测，发现RM随频率呈幂律增加，表明介质中的快速电子密度下降。总体而言，该研究对夸萨尔1604+159的磁场结构和偏振变化进行了全面的研究。 <div>
We have analyzed the total intensity, spectral index, linear polarization, and rotation measure (RM) distributions at the parsec scale for the quasar 1604+159. The source was observed at 5.0, 8.4, and 15.4 GHz in 2002 and 4.6, 5.1, 6.0, 7.8, 12.2, 15.2, and 43.9 GHz in 2020 with the American Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). Combining the polarization results of Monitoring of Jets in Active Galactic Nuclei with VLBA Experiments at 15 GHz from 2009 to 2013, we studied the evolution of magnetic field at the parsec scale for the source. We detected a core-jet structure. The jet extends to the distance of ∼25 mas from the core at a direction of ∼66° north by east. The shape of the jet derived from 15 GHz data varies slightly with time and could be described by a straight line. Based on the linear polarization distribution in 2002, we divided the source structure into the central region and the jet region. In the jet region, we find the polarized emission varies with time. The flatter spectral index values and electric vector position angle direction indicate the possible existence of shocks, contributing to the variation of polarization in the jet with time. In the central region, the derived core shift index kr values indicate that the core in 2002 is close to the equipartition case, while it deviated from the case in 2020. The measured magnetic field strength in 2020 is 2 orders of magnitude lower than that in 2002. We detected transverse RM gradients, evidence of a helical magnetic field, in the core. The polarized emission orients in general toward the jet direction in the core. At 15 GHz, in the place close to the jet base, the polarization direction changes significantly with time from perpendicular to parallel to the jet direction. The evolution of RM and magnetic field structure are potential reasons for the observed polarization change. The core ∣RM∣ in 2020 increases with frequency following a power law with index a = 2.7 ± 0.5, suggesting a fast electron density falloff in the medium with distance from the jet base.

We present optical observations and analysis of the bright type Iax supernova SN 2020udy hosted by NGC 0812. The evolution of the light curve of SN 2020udy is similar to that of other bright type Iax SNe. Analytical modeling of the quasi-bolometric light curves of SN 2020udy suggests that 0.08 ± 0.01 M⊙ of 56Ni would have been synthesized during the explosion. The spectral features of SN 2020udy are similar to those of the bright members of type Iax class, showing a weak Si ii line. The late-time spectral sequence is mostly dominated by iron group elements with broad emission lines. Abundance tomography modeling of the spectral time series of SN 2020udy using TARDIS indicates stratification in the outer ejecta; however, to confirm this, spectral modeling at a very early phase is required. After maximum light, uniform mixing of chemical elements is sufficient to explain the spectral evolution. Unlike in the case of normal type Ia SNe, the photospheric approximation remains robust until +100 days, requiring an additional continuum source. Overall, the observational features of SN 2020udy are consistent with the deflagration of a carbon–oxygen white dwarf.

Discovered more than 50 years ago, gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission remains the most puzzling aspect of GRB physics. Its complex and irregular nature should reveal how newborn GRB engines release their energy. In this respect, the possibility that GRB engines could operate as self-organized critical (SOC) systems has been put forward. Here, we present the energy, luminosity, waiting time, and duration distributions of individual pulses of GRBs with known redshift detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor. This is the first study of this kind in which selection effects are accounted for. The compatibility of our results with the framework of SOC theory is discussed. We found evidence for an intrinsic break in the power-law models that describe the energy and the luminosity distributions.

总结: 
本研究利用磁层多尺度太空飞船获取的高分辨率数据，直接证明了湍流在促进磁重联过程中起着重要作用。我们发现湍流的强度对能量转换具有显著影响，较强的湍流会产生更一致的具有较小空间尺度的结构，这些结构对磁重联过程中的能量转换至关重要。然而，我们发现湍流对粒子加热影响不大，但会影响这两个事件中离子的整体动能。这些发现显著推进了我们对天体物理等离子体中湍流和重联关系的理解。 <br /><br /> <div>
Magnetic reconnection and turbulence are two of the most significant mechanisms for energy dissipation in collisionless plasma. The role of turbulence in magnetic reconnection poses an outstanding problem in astrophysics and plasma physics. It is still unclear whether turbulence can modify the reconnection process by enhancing the reconnection rate or energy conversion rate. In this study, utilizing unprecedented high-resolution data obtained from the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft, we provide direct evidence that turbulence plays a vital role in promoting energy conversion during reconnection. We reached this conclusion by comparing magnetotail reconnection events with similar inflow Alfvén speed and plasma β but varying amplitudes of turbulence. The disparity in energy conversion was attributed to the strength of turbulence. Stronger turbulence generates more coherent structures with smaller spatial scales, which are pivotal contributors to energy conversion during reconnection. However, we find that turbulence has negligible impact on particle heating, but it does affect the ion bulk kinetic energy in these two events. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the relationship between turbulence and reconnection in astrophysical plasmas.

总结:<br />
本研究使用高分辨率近红外（NIR）光谱对HD 200775进行了分析，发现了八条禁线，其中包括[S ii]、[N i]和[Fe ii]等元素的禁线。研究表明这些禁线可以作为盘风迹象的有力指标，尤其是[N i]线可以用于推导盘风气体的基本物理参数。研究结论具有重要意义，但是对这些禁线的研究仅限于一颗天体，因此需要进一步的研究来验证其性质。 <div>
In this study, we performed high-resolution near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy (R = 28,000; λ = 0.90–1.35 μm) with a high signal-to-noise ratio on HD 200775, a very young (∼0.1 Myr old) and massive intermediate-mass star (a binary star with a mass of about 10 M⊙ each) with a protoplanetary disk. The obtained spectra show eight forbidden lines of three elements: two of [S ii] (10289 and 10323 Å), two of [N i] (10400 and 10410 Å), and four of [Fe ii] (12570, 12946, 12981, and 13209 Å). This is the first time that the [N i] lines are detected in a young stellar object with a doublet deblended. Gaussian fitting of the spectra indicates that all line profiles have low-velocity components and exhibit blueshifted features, suggesting that all lines originate from the disk winds (magnetohydrodynamic disk wind and/or photoevaporative wind). Based on the fit, the [N i] and [Fe ii] lines are categorized into narrow components, while the [S ii] lines are at the boundary between broad and narrow components. These forbidden lines are suggested to be very promising disk wind tracers among the existing ones because they are in the NIR-wavelength range, which can be observed from early stages with high sensitivities. Among these lines, [N i] lines would be a rather powerful probe for deriving the basic physical parameters of disk wind gases. However, the study of these lines herein is limited to one object; thus, further studies are needed to examine their properties.

这项研究更新了包括1092个6.7 GHz甲醇激射源的目录。此外，利用上海天马射电望远镜观测了214个星形成区域的NH3 (1, 1), NH3 (2, 2), 和 NH3 (3, 3)跃迁，以检验与银河尺度上甲醇激射源相关的分子云的激发温度和柱密度等物理环境的差异。统计结果表明，Perseus臂中的6.7 GHz甲醇激射源数量明显低于其他三个主要螺旋臂。此外，Perseus臂的气体柱密度也是NH3观测到的主要螺旋臂中最低的。这两点发现表明，与其他三个主要螺旋臂相比，Perseus臂的高质量恒星形成速率最低。我们还观测到一个趋势，即6.7 GHz甲醇激射源的亮度和氨气柱密度均随着银心距的增加而下降。这一发现表明，银河系内部的物质密度通常比外部高，进一步暗示在螺旋臂的前端更容易形成高质量恒星。此外，我们发现螺旋臂区域中氨气的柱密度高于螺旋臂间区域，支持前者更可能是高质量恒星的诞生地。<br /><br />总结: 该研究更新了6.7 GHz甲醇激射源目录，并观测了NH3跃迁，发现Perseus臂中的6.7 GHz甲醇激射源数量较低，气体柱密度也最低，提示该区域的高质量恒星形成速率低。研究还表明在银心距增加时，银河系内部的物质密度更高，高质量恒星更容易形成，并且螺旋臂区域中氨气的柱密度更高，更可能是高质量恒星的诞生地。 <div>
An updated catalog consisting of 1092 6.7 GHz methanol maser sources is reported in this work. Additionally, the NH3 (1, 1), NH3 (2, 2), and NH3 (3, 3) transitions were observed toward 214 star-forming regions using the Shanghai Tianma radio telescope in order to examine the differences in physical environments, such as the excitation temperature and column density of molecular clouds associated with methanol masers on the Galactic scale. Statistical results reveal that the number of 6.7 GHz methanol masers in the Perseus arm is significantly lower than that in the other three main spiral arms. In addition, the Perseus arm also has the lowest gas column density among the main spiral arms traced by the NH3 observations. Both findings suggest that the Perseus arm has the lowest rate of high-mass star formation compared to the other three main spiral arms. We also observed a trend in which both the luminosity of the 6.7 GHz methanol masers and the ammonia gas column density decreased with the galactocentric distance. This finding indicates that the density of material in the inner Milky Way is generally higher than that in the outer Milky Way. This further suggests that high-mass stars are more easily formed at the head of the spiral arms. Furthermore, we found that the column density of ammonia gas is higher in the regions on the arms than in the inter-arm regions, supporting that the former is more likely to be the birthplace of high-mass stars.

<div> 无线安静，GRS 1734-292，费米探测，ALMA观测，非热活动。
Seyfert星系，毫米过剩，时间变异，辐射谱。
高能粒子加速，活动星系核。 

<br /><br />总结:
GRS 1734-292是一个无线安静的星系，既没有剧烈的星暴活动，也没有喷流活动。然而，费米探测到了这个星系在GeV波段的活动。通过ALMA的观测，证实了在星系中心约100光年范围内存在毫米过剩，并且这种过剩还具有时间变化。根据观测结果，研究人员认为这种活动可能源自于核心区域小于100个Schwarzschild半径的紧凑源上的辐射活动。未来更高分辨率的毫米波观测将有助于进一步揭示这一现象的真相，为我们提供了解活动星系核中高能粒子加速位置的重要线索。 <div>
GRS 1734-292 is a radio-quiet galaxy, exhibiting neither intense starburst nor jet activities. However, Fermi-LAT detected this object in the GeV band. The origin of nonthermal activity in this Seyfert galaxy is an intriguing question. We report Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of GRS 1734-292 at frequencies of 97.5, 145, and 225 GHz. These observations confirmed the millimeter excess within the central ⪅100 pc region and its time variability based on two separate observations conducted 4 days apart. The timescale of variability aligns with the light-crossing time for a compact source smaller than <100 Schwarzschild radius. If we take into account the power-law synchrotron emission originating from the corona (i.e., the hot plasma located above the accretion disk), the millimeter spectrum indicates the coronal magnetic field of ≈10 G and the size of ≈10 Schwarzschild radius. An alternative explanation for this millimeter emission could be synchrotron and free–free emission from disk winds (i.e., fast wide-opening angle outflows from the disk) with the size of ≈10 pc, although it may be difficult to explain the fast variability. Future millimeter observations with higher resolution (<0.″01) will enable the differentiation between these two scenarios. Such observations will provide insights into the acceleration sites of high-energy particles at the core of active galactic nuclei.

<div> 高质量X射线双星，矮星系，光度函数，金属丰度，星形成率

这项研究利用钱德拉光学望远镜的数据档案，选择了一组临近矮星系，建立了在低质量星系中的高质量X射线双星（HMXB）的光度函数，并分析了其与金属丰度的关联。研究扩大了之前调查所涉及的特定星形成率（sSFR）和气相金属丰度的范围。结果表明，在矮星系中，HMXB的光度函数呈现出较为平缓的幂律斜率，且在较高光度下存在显著的随机抽样特征。这可能解释了我们观察到的矮星系整体HMXB光度与金属丰度的LX/SFR之间的明显分散。研究结论对于理解目前和未来X射线调查领域中识别出的低质量星系中的活动星系核内容具有重要意义，并对双星群合成模型以及早期宇宙的X射线驱动宇宙加热具有影响。 <br /><br />总结: 钱德拉光学望远镜的数据档案被用来研究矮星系中的高质量X射线双星，发现其光度函数与金属丰度存在关联。研究结果表明在矮星系中，HMXB的光度函数呈现出较为平缓的幂律斜率，且在较高光度下存在显著的随机抽样特征。这对于理解目前和未来X射线调查领域中识别出的低质量星系中的活动星系核内容具有重要意义，并对双星群合成模型以及早期宇宙的X射线驱动宇宙加热具有影响。 <div>
Drawing from the Chandra archive and using a carefully selected set of nearby dwarf galaxies, we present a calibrated high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) luminosity function in the low-mass galaxy regime and search for an already hinted at dependence on metallicity. Our study introduces a new sample of local dwarf galaxies (D < 12.5 Mpc and M* < 5 × 109M⊙), expanding the specific star formation rates (sSFR) and gas-phase metallicities probed in previous investigations. Our analysis of the observed X-ray luminosity function indicates a shallower power-law slope for the dwarf galaxy HMXB population. In our study, we focus on dwarf galaxies that are more representative in terms of sSFR compared to prior work. In this regime, the HMXB luminosity function exhibits significant stochastic sampling at high luminosities. This likely accounts for the pronounced scatter observed in the galaxy-integrated HMXB population’s LX/SFR versus metallicity for our galaxy sample. Our calibration is necessary to understand the active galactic nuclei content of low-mass galaxies identified in current and future X-ray survey fields and has implications for binary population synthesis models, as well as X-ray-driven cosmic heating in the early Universe.

<div> 关键词: 反射光谱, 黑洞, 辐射模型, 模拟观测, 参数拟合

反射光谱的计算模型考虑了返回辐射的影响，能够对Kerr时空中的薄吸积盘进行准确计算。通过使用真实入射辐射的光谱，该模型在吸积盘上每个点都能计算出反射光谱。使用lamppost冠状结构进行模拟观测，我们发现在黑洞自转参数极高、冠状高度和盘的电离参数低时，带有返回辐射的relxill模型无法很好地拟合模拟数据，某些参数可能被显著高估或低估。随着黑洞自转参数值的降低和冠状高度的增加，我们能够得到更好的拟合，并恢复出正确的输入参数数值。

<br /><br />总结: 本研究提出了一个新的模型来计算Kerr时空中薄吸积盘的反射光谱，考虑了返回辐射的影响。模拟观测表明，在一些特定参数范围内，现有模型无法很好地拟合数据，但可以在更低的自转参数和更高的冠状高度下得到更好的拟合结果和正确的参数恢复。 <div>
We present a new model to calculate reflection spectra of thin accretion disks in Kerr spacetimes. Our model includes the effect of returning radiation, which is the radiation that is emitted by the disk and returns to the disk because of the strong light bending near a black hole. The major improvement with respect to the existing models is that it calculates the reflection spectrum at every point on the disk by using the actual spectrum of the incident radiation. Assuming a lamppost coronal geometry, we simulate simultaneous observations of NICER and NuSTAR of bright Galactic black holes and we fit the simulated data with the latest version of relxill (modified to read the table of reflionx, which is the nonrelativistic reflection model used in our calculations). We find that relxill with returning radiation cannot fit well the simulated data when the black hole spin parameter is very high and the coronal height and disk’s ionization parameter are low, and some parameters can be significantly overestimated or underestimated. We can find better fits and recover the correct input parameters as the value of the black hole spin parameter decreases and the value of the coronal height increases.

<title>The GMRT High-resolution Southern Sky Survey for Pulsars and Transients. VII. Timing of the Spider Millisecond Pulsar PSR J1242–4712, a Bridge between Redback and Black Widow Pulsars</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a timing solution for the 5.31 ms spider millisecond pulsar (MSP) J1242−4712, discovered with the GMRT. PSR J1242−4712 orbits a companion of minimum mass 0.08 M⊙ with an orbital period of 7.7 hr and occupies a relatively unexplored region in the orbital period versus companion mass space. We did not detect gamma-ray pulsations for this MSP, and also could not identify the optical counterpart for PSR J1242–4712 in available optical/near-infrared data. The profile of J1242−4712 evolves with frequency, showing a clear single component at lower frequencies and a three-component profile at 650 MHz. PSR J1242−4712 eclipses for a very short duration near superior conjunction (orbital phase ∼ 0.23−0.25) below 360 MHz. Moreover, significant dispersion measure delays and errors in the pulse times of arrivals are observed near inferior conjunction (orbital phase ∼ 0.7), along with an observed eclipse in one epoch at 650 MHz. Observed eclipses and significant orbital period variability suggest that PSR J1242−4712 is possibly not a helium star−white dwarf binary, but has a semi- or nondegenerate companion, indicating that this is a “spider” MSP lying in a region between typical black widows and redbacks. This system may represent a distinct category of spider MSPs, displaying characteristics that bridge the gap between known black widow and redback MSPs.

<title>Identifying Plasma Fractionation Processes in the Chromosphere Using IRIS</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The composition of the solar corona differs from that of the photosphere, with the plasma thought to fractionate in the solar chromosphere according to the first ionization potential (FIP) of the different elements. This produces a FIP bias, wherein elements with a low FIP are preferentially enhanced in the corona compared to their photospheric abundance, but direct observations of this process remain elusive. Here, we use a series of spectroscopic observations of active region AR 12759 as it transited the solar disk over a period of 6 days from 2020 April 2–7 taken using the Hinode Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer and Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) instruments to look for signatures of plasma fractionation in the solar chromosphere. Using the Si x/S x and Ca xiv/Ar xiv diagnostics, we find distinct differences between the FIP bias of the leading and following polarities of the active region. The widths of the IRIS Si iv lines exhibited clear differences between the leading and following polarity regions, indicating increased unresolved wave activity in the following polarity region compared to the leading polarity region, with the chromospheric velocities derived using the Mg ii lines exhibiting comparable, albeit much weaker, behavior. These results are consistent with plasma fractionation via resonant/nonresonant waves at different locations in the solar chromosphere following the ponderomotive force model, and indicate that IRIS could be used to further study this fundamental physical process.

<title>Visit Nearby Halo Substructures Using LAMOST DR9 MRS Data</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3240</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Based on the LAMOST DR9 Medium Resolution Spectra (MRS) catalog, combined with astrometries from Gaia DR3, we conducted an investigation into the substructures in the stellar halo to obtain their chemical and kinematic information. We employed the HDBSCAN algorithm in the (Lz, E, Lxy) space for clustering and utilized Mahalanobis distance to merge the clustering results. Ultimately, within the LAMOST DR9 MRS catalog, we identified members of Gaia–Sausage–Enceladus (GSE), Helmi streams, and the high-α disk and in situ halo. Additionally, there are three clusters that cannot be correlated with known substructures. Based on their angular momentum (Lz) characteristics, we have tentatively named two of them High-Lz-Cluster-1 (HLC-1) and High-Lz-Cluster-2 (HLC-2), both exhibiting high angular momentum (Lz) features. The third cluster, owing to its extremely low Lz, is termed the Low-Lz-Cluster. Then detailed analysis about those substructures are executed including member stars’ identification and kinematic and chemical distribution. The resulting GSE member stars exhibit a well-defined metallicity distribution function with its peak at [Fe/H] ∼ −1.2, consistent with previous findings, and we found there appear to be some differences in the distribution on the Vtotal–rgal plane between GSE and its included Splash component. Regarding Helmi streams, in the [Mg/Fe]–[Fe/H] plane we detected potential traces of the α-knee phenomenon at [Fe/H] ∼ −1.53. Finally, we tentatively provide the possible origin for the HLC-1 and HLC-2.

<title>Parallel Diffusion Coefficient of Energetic Charged Particles in the Inner Heliosphere from the Turbulent Magnetic Fields Measured by Parker Solar Probe</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Diffusion coefficients of energetic charged particles in turbulent magnetic fields are a fundamental aspect of diffusive transport theory but remain incompletely understood. In this work, we use quasi-linear theory to evaluate the spatial variation of the parallel diffusion coefficient κ∥ from the measured magnetic turbulence power spectra in the inner heliosphere. We consider the magnetic field and plasma velocity measurements from Parker Solar Probe made during Orbits 5–13. The parallel diffusion coefficient is calculated as a function of radial distance from 0.062 to 0.8 au, and the particle energy from 100 keV to 1 GeV. We find that κ∥ increases exponentially with both heliocentric distance and energy of particles. The fluctuations in κ∥ are related to the episodes of large-scale magnetic structures in the solar wind. By fitting the results, we also provide an empirical formula of κ∥ = (5.16 ± 1.22) × 1018r1.17±0.08E0.71±0.02 (cm2 s−1) in the inner heliosphere, which can be used as a reference in studying the transport and acceleration of solar energetic particles as well as the modulation of cosmic rays.

<title>Suppression of Star Formation in Galaxy Pairs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the suppression of star formation in galaxy pairs based on the isolated galaxy pair sample derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey survey. By comparing the star formation rate between late-type galaxies (LTGs) in galaxy pairs and those in the isolated environment, we detect a signal of the suppression of star formation in galaxy pairs at dp < 100 kpc and 200 kpc < dp < 350 kpc. The occurrence of the suppression of star formation in these LTGs requires their companion galaxies to have an early-type morphology (ns > 2.5). The suppression of star formation in wide galaxy pairs at 200 kpc < dp < 350 kpc mainly occurs in massive LTGs, while in close galaxy pairs at dp < 100 kpc, it only appears in LTGs with a massive companion ( ), nearly independent of their own stellar mass. Based on these findings, we infer that the suppression of star formation in wide galaxy pairs is actually a result of galaxy conformity, while in close galaxy pairs, it stems from the influence of hot circumgalactic medium surrounding companion galaxies.

<title>Resonant Absorption of Magnetohydrodynamic Body Modes under Photospheric Conditions</title>

Observations reveal that surface and body modes exist in solar pores under photospheric conditions. While the effects of resonant absorption on photospheric surface modes are well established, its effect on body modes is not known yet. In this paper, we investigate resonant absorption for the body modes under photospheric conditions. We numerically solve the dispersion relation induced by thin boundary approximation and obtain the wave dispersion curves and damping rates of three arbitrarily chosen body modes for sausage and kink waves, respectively. The results show that resonant absorption for the body modes is weaker than for the slow surface modes in both cusp and Alfvén continua. The damping behavior of body modes is similar to slow surface modes while the higher body mode has stronger resonant absorption.

<title>Study of Magnetic Field and Turbulence in the TeV Halo around the Monogem Pulsar</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Magnetic fields are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium, including extended objects such as supernova remnants and diffuse halos around pulsars. Its turbulent characteristics govern the diffusion of cosmic rays and the multiwavelength emission from pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). However, the geometry and turbulence nature of the magnetic fields in the ambient region of PWN is still unknown. Recent gamma-ray observations from HAWC and synchrotron observations suggest a highly suppressed diffusion coefficient compared to the mean interstellar value. In this study, we present the first direct observational evidence of the orientation of the mean magnetic field and turbulent characteristics by employing a recently developed statistical parameter “Yturb” in the extended halo around the Monogem pulsar. Our study points to two possible scenarios: nearly aligned toward the line of sight (LOS) with compressible modes dominance or high inclination angle toward the LOS and characterized by Alfvénic turbulence. The first scenario appears consistent with other observational signatures. Furthermore, we report that the magnetic field has an observed correlation length of approximately 3 ± 0.6 pc in the Monogem halo. Our study highlights the pivotal role of magnetic field and turbulence in unraveling the physical processes in TeV halos and cosmic-ray transport.

研究使用Mn-Cr方法测定了龙宫粒子的水改造年龄，得出了形成Ca-Al富集体(CAI)后4.13 + 0.62/−0.55百万年的年龄。这个年龄相当于4563.17 + 0.60/−0.67百万年前。龙宫样本的55Mn/52Cr，ε54Cr和初始ε53Cr值高于任何碳质球粒陨石样本，暗示其母本体是由原始盘的外部区域最少热加工的前体物质形成。尽管龙宫等含水小行星与太阳的距离不同，它们在有限的时间内（在CAI之后的3.8±1.8百万年）经历了水改造。这些年龄与碳质无球粒陨石NWA 6704/6693的结晶年龄误差相同。龙宫和NWA 6704/6693的ε54Cr和初始ε53Cr值相同，但它们显示出不同的Δ'17O值。这表明形成龙宫和NWA 6703/6693母体的前体物质是在原始太阳星盘中的相邻位置形成，并经历了类似程度的热加工，但龙宫的母本体由较高的冰/尘埃比率在原始星盘的外部区域形成。 <div>
The analysis of samples returned from the C-type asteroid Ryugu has drastically advanced our knowledge of the evolution of early solar system materials. However, no consensus has been obtained on the chronological data, which is important for understanding the evolution of the asteroid Ryugu. Here, the aqueous alteration age of Ryugu particles was determined by the Mn–Cr method using bulk samples, yielding an age of 4.13 + 0.62/−0.55 Myr after the formation of Ca–Al-rich inclusions (CAI). The age corresponds to 4563.17 + 0.60/−0.67 Myr ago. The higher 55Mn/52Cr, ε54Cr, and initial ε53Cr values of the Ryugu samples relative to any carbonaceous chondrite samples implies that its progenitor body formed from the least thermally processed precursors in the outermost region of the protoplanetary disk. Despite accreting at different distances from the Sun, the hydrous asteroids (Ryugu and the parent bodies of CI, CM, CR, and ungrouped C2 meteorites) underwent aqueous alteration during a period of limited duration (3.8 ± 1.8 Myr after CAI). These ages are identical to the crystallization age of the carbonaceous achondirtes NWA 6704/6693 within the error. The ε54Cr and initial ε53Cr values of Ryugu and NWA 6704/6693 are also identical, while they show distinct Δ'17O values. This suggests that the precursors that formed the progenitor bodies of Ryugu and NWA 6703/6693 were formed in close proximity and experienced a similar degree of thermal processing in the protosolar nebula. However, the progenitor body of Ryugu was formed by a higher ice/dust ratio, than NWA6703/6693, in the outer region of the protoplanetary disk.

Parker Solar Probe在2022年2月27日和28日观察到了一个小的分散事件，表明在低日冕和35个太阳半径以上之间，无散射传播是主要的传输机制。该事件发生在PSP遇到过多次的特定通量管沿特定轨道条件下。PSP轨道的这一部分相对于旋转的太阳表面具有几乎静止的角运动，使得PSP的运动在旋转参考系中基本呈径向运动。这一事件的时间离散通常出现在脉冲太阳能粒子事件中，并且速度包括核心太阳风离子的速度。特别是在事件开始时，3He含量远大于通常在∼100keV到数MeV的能量范围内观察到的氦的太阳能粒子丰度。事件后期，铁增加。组成特征表明这是一个加速机制的例子，用于在SEP事件中产生所需的种子能粒子，以解释这些事件中各种物种的富集高于太阳丰度。对PSP任务中类似轨道条件的初步搜索尚未发现其他类似事件，尽管所需的有利条件（孤立的脉冲加速和与最小磁场波动的良好有序磁场连接）很少实现，鉴于满足这些观测条件的PSP轨迹的小部分。 <br /><br />总结: Parker Solar Probe在2022年2月观察到了一个小的分散事件，揭示了无散射传播作为主要传输机制。通过特定轨道条件，该事件提供了关于脉冲太阳能粒子事件的时间离散以及关于氦和铁等成分的重要信息。这对于理解SEP事件中的加速机制具有重要意义，而在PSP任务中类似的轨道条件较少发现。 <div>
Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations of a small dispersive event on 2022 February 27 and 28 indicate scatter-free propagation as the dominant transport mechanism between the low corona and greater than 35 solar radii. The event occurred during unique orbital conditions that prevailed along specific flux tubes that PSP encountered repeatedly between 25 and 35 Rs during outbound orbit 11. This segment of the PSP orbit exhibits almost stationary angular motion relative to the rotating solar surface, such that in the rotating frame, PSP’s motion is essentially radial. The time dispersion often observed in impulsive solar energetic particle (SEP) events continues in this case down to velocities including the core solar-wind ion velocities. Especially at the onset of this event, the 3He content is much larger than the usual SEP abundances seen in the energy range from ∼100 keV to several MeV for helium. Later in the event, iron is enhanced. The compositional signatures suggest this to be an example of an acceleration mechanism for generating the seed energetic particles required by shock (or compression) acceleration models in SEP events to account for the enrichment of various species above solar abundances in such events. A preliminary search of similar orbital conditions over the PSP mission has not revealed additional such events, although favorable conditions (isolated impulsive acceleration and well-ordered magnetic field connection with minimal magnetic field fluctuation) that would be required are infrequently realized, given the small fraction of the PSP trajectory that meets these observation conditions.

There exist very few mid-infrared (IR) observations of supernovae (SNe) in general. Therefore, SN 1987A, the closest visible SN in 400 yr, gives us the opportunity to explore the mid-IR properties of SNe, the dust in their ejecta, and the surrounding medium and to witness the birth of an SN remnant (SNR). The James Webb Space Telescope, with its high spatial resolution and extreme sensitivity, gives a new view on these issues. We report on the first imaging observations obtained with the Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI). We build temperature maps and discuss the morphology of the nascent SNR. Our results show that the temperatures in the equatorial ring (ER) are quite nonuniform. This could be due to dust destruction in some parts of the ring, as had been assumed in some previous works. We show that the IR emission extends beyond the ER, illustrating the fact that the shock wave has now passed through this ring to affect the circumstellar medium on a larger scale. Finally, while submillimeter Atacama Large Millimeter Array observations have hinted at the location of the compact remnant of SN 1987A, we note that our MIRI data have found no such evidence.

这篇文章讨论了2013年新发现的经典新星V339 Del的特点，该新星的V光度曲线出现1.5等星的明显下降，因为形成了一个尘埃壳，与此同时还存在着软X射线的辐射。作者提出了一个多波段光度曲线模型，成功地复现了y和V光度曲线以及伽马射线和X射线光度曲线。在模型中，光度曲线下降后出现了强烈的激波，尘埃壳的形成抑制了[O iii]的辐射，导致V光度曲线下降，之后又逐渐恢复。白矮星的质量被确定为1.25 ± 0.05 M☉，V波段的距离模数为(m − M)V = 12.2 ± 0.2；考虑到消光作用，距离为d = 2.1 ± 0.2 kpc，E(B − V) = 0.18。 <div>
The classical nova V339 Del 2013 is characterized by a 1.5 mag dip of the V light curve owing to a dust shell formation, with which soft X-ray emissions coexist. We present a Strömgren y-band light curve, which represents continuum emission, not influenced by strong [O iii] emission lines. The y light curve monotonically decreases in marked contrast to the V light curve that shows a 1.5 mag dip. We propose a multiwavelength light-curve model that reproduces the y and V light curves as well as the gamma-ray and X-ray light curves. In our model, a strong shock arises far outside the photosphere after optical maximum, because later ejected matter collides with earlier ejected gas. Our shocked shell model explains optical emission lines, Hα, hard X-ray, and gamma-ray fluxes. A dust shell forms behind the shock that suppresses [O iii]. This low flux of [O iii] shapes a 1.5 mag drop in the V light curve. Then, the V flux recovers with an increasing contribution from [O iii] lines, while the y flux does not. However, the optical depth of the dust shell is too small to absorb the photospheric (X-ray) emission of the white dwarf. This is the reason that a dust shell and soft X-ray radiation coexist. We determined the white dwarf mass to be MWD = 1.25 ± 0.05 M☉ and the distance modulus in the V band to be (m − M)V = 12.2 ± 0.2; the distance is d = 2.1 ± 0.2 kpc for the reddening of E(B − V) = 0.18.

<br /><br />
这篇文章研究了太阳内部的惯性波模式，发现在高方位阶数下，这些模式似乎与薄壳Rossby-Haurwitz模型有所偏离。研究采用了谱特征值求解器计算了差异旋转条件下的太阳惯性模式的谱。特别是关注赤道Rossby模式，发现计算得到的模式频率与观测的太阳模式频率非常接近，但n=0的模式明显向后偏转。这表明太阳的测量结果可能与n较高的模式相对应。此外，数值得到的特征函数似乎位于对流区内部，与太阳观测有显著差异，使推断变得更加复杂。 
<br /><br />总结: 挖掘了太阳内部的惯性波模式特性，发现了高方位阶数下模式的偏离及差异旋转影响，对赤道Rossby模式进行了重点研究，发现了模式频率的相似之处以及n=0模式的偏转，也指出了数值计算得到的特征函数的深层位置与太阳观测存在的差异。 <div>
Inertial wave modes in the Sun are of interest owing to their potential to reveal new insight into the solar interior. These predominantly retrograde-propagating modes in the solar subsurface appear to deviate from the thin-shell Rossby–Haurwitz model at high azimuthal orders. We present new measurements of sectoral inertial modes at m > 15 where the modes appear to become progressively less retrograde compared to the canonical Rossby–Haurwitz dispersion relation in a corotating frame. We use a spectral eigenvalue solver to compute the spectrum of solar inertial modes in the presence of differential rotation. Focussing specifically on equatorial Rossby modes, we find that the numerically obtained mode frequencies lie along distinct ridges, one of which lies strikingly close to the observed mode frequencies in the Sun. We also find that the n = 0 ridge is deflected strongly in the retrograde direction. This suggests that the solar measurements may not correspond to the fundamental n = 0 Rossby–Haurwitz solutions as was initially suspected, but to those for a higher n. The numerically obtained eigenfunctions also appear to sit deep within the convection zone—unlike those for the n = 0 modes—which differs substantially from solar measurements and complicates inference.

We present the results of models of impulsively heated coronal loops using the 1D hydrodynamic Adaptively Refined Godunov Solver code. The impulsive heating events (which we refer to as nanoflares) are modeled by discrete pulses of energy along the loop. We explore the occurrence of cold condensations due to the effective equivalent of thermal nonequilibrium in loops with steady heating, and examine its dependence on nanoflare timing and intensity and also nanoflare location along the loop, including randomized distributions of nanoflares. We find that randomizing the distribution of nanoflares, both in time/intensity and location, diminishes the likelihood of condensation occurring as compared to distributions with regularly occurring nanoflares with the same average properties. The usual criteria that condensation is favored for heating near loop footpoints and with high cadences are more strict for randomized (as opposed to regular) nanoflare distributions, and for randomized distributions the condensations stay in the loop for a shorter amount of time. That said, condensation can sometimes occur in cases where the average values of parameters (frequency or location) are beyond the critical limits above which condensation does not occur for corresponding steady, non-randomized values of those parameters. These properties of condensation occurring due to randomized heating can be used in the future to investigate the diagnostics of coronal heating mechanisms.

<div> FRBs, Macquart relation, dispersion measure, Hubble constant, fluctuation parameter
<br />
FRB的色散测量与宿主星系的红移之间存在相关性，这种相关性敏感于星系间介质中的重子分布，而这些重子可能通过反馈过程从星系暗物质晕中喷射出来。研究利用78个FRB的数据对波动参数F进行了新的测量，其中21个FRB已被定位于宿主星系。分析同时拟合哈勃常数H0和FRB宿主星系导致的DM分布。研究发现，波动参数与这些参数存在退化关系，尤其是H0。使用100个定位FRB的合成样本，对波动参数的约束提高了约2倍。将F的测量结果与宇宙学模拟（IllustrisTNG）中的预测进行比较，发现在红移0.4 < z和z < 2.0时存在一致性。然而，在z < 0.4时，模拟结果低估了F，这被归因于低红移时快速变化的宇宙间余量分布。 
<br /><br />总结: FRB的色散测量与宿主星系红移之间的Macquart关系受到星系间介质中的重子分布的影响，这项研究采用了78个FRB并发现了影响参数F的新测量结果，同时发现该参数与哈勃常数H0存在退化关系。通过与宇宙模拟进行比较，得出了F的预测结果与观测结果的一致性，并指出了低红移时宇宙间余量分布的快速变化。 <div>
The Macquart relation describes the correlation between the dispersion measure (DM) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) and the redshift z of their host galaxies. The scatter of the Macquart relation is sensitive to the distribution of baryons in the intergalactic medium including those ejected from galactic halos through feedback processes. The variance of the distribution in DMs from the cosmic web (DMcosmic) is parameterized by a fluctuation parameter F. In this work, we present a new measurement of F using 78 FRBs of which 21 have been localized to host galaxies. Our analysis simultaneously fits for the Hubble constant H0 and the DM distribution due to the FRB host galaxy. We find that the fluctuation parameter is degenerate with these parameters, most notably H0, and use a uniform prior on H0 to measure at the 3σ confidence interval and a new constraint on the Hubble constant . Using a synthetic sample of 100 localized FRBs, the constraint on the fluctuation parameter is improved by a factor of ∼2. Comparing our F measurement to simulated predictions from cosmological simulation (IllustrisTNG), we find agreement between redshifts 0.4 < z and z < 2.0. However, at z < 0.4, the simulations underpredict F, which we attribute to the rapidly changing extragalactic DM excess distribution at low redshift.

这篇文章通过广义相对论磁流体动力学模拟研究发现，黑洞的旋转能量会优先沿着穿过视界的磁场线提取，同时还展示了在不同视角观测下，喷流呈现出明显的边缘亮度结构。研究还发现，喷流在高度聚类时横向宽度会从圆锥形逐渐变为抛物线形，并在M87喷流中展示了聚类在距离黑洞100个Schwarzschild半径内发生的情况。 <div>
Using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, it has been suggested that the rotational energy of a rapidly rotating black hole (BH) is preferentially extracted along the magnetic field lines threading the event horizon in the middle and lower latitudes. Applying this angle-dependent Poynting flux to the jet downstream, we demonstrate that the jets exhibit limb-brightened structures at various viewing angles, as observed from Mrk 501, M87, and Cyg A between 5° and 75°, and that the limb brightening is enhanced when the jet is collimated strongly. It is also found that the jet width perpendicular to the propagation direction shrinks at the projected distance of the altitude where the jet collimates from a conical shape (near the BH) to a parabolic one (in the jet). Comparing with Very Long Baseline Interferometry observations, we show that this collimation takes place within the deprojected altitude of 100 Schwarzschild radii from the BH in the case of the M87 jet.

总结:
水分子在硅酸盐表面上的捕获现象对各种天体物理环境具有重要意义，实验结果表明，这种捕获现象取决于表面的性质和组成。硅酸盐表面的亲水性使得水分子可以被有效捕获，而捕获的性质是物理吸附而非化学吸附。此外，研究还表明，在高达470K的温度下仍然可以捕获水分子，这说明在行星形成盘中可能存在着湿润的硅酸盐颗粒。对于已捕获的水的热稳定性和紫外线稳定性的研究结果表明，在漫射的星际介质中检测到了被捕获的水分子，说明水分子有高效的持续形成。最后，研究还探讨了这些结果对一些基础科学问题的意义，比如氧的消耗问题、地球上水的起源以及岩石行星的形成。 <div>
The existence of strongly bound water molecules on silicate surfaces, above the desorption temperature of water ice, was first predicted by computational studies and has recently been demonstrated by laboratory experiments. Such trapped water may be present in various astrophysical environments and there is now evidence for its presence in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) and in extraterrestrial particles. We present here new results of a laboratory study of the phenomenon of trapping (strong bonding) of water molecules by silicates. We show that the efficiency of the trapping is strongly dependent on the properties and composition of the surface. Our results point out that the presence of trapped water should be due to the hydrophilic properties of the silicate surface and that the nature of the trapping is physical (physisorption rather than chemisorption). We demonstrate that water can be trapped on silicates up to temperatures of about 470 K, which speaks for the presence of wet silicate grains in the terrestrial planet formation zone in planet-forming disks. Studying the thermal and UV stability of trapped water, we conclude that the detection of trapped water in the diffuse ISM speaks for its efficient continuous formation. We discuss our results as relevant to fundamental scientific questions, such as the oxygen depletion problem, the origin of water on Earth, and the formation of rocky planets.

<div> Gaia Data Release 2, M dwarf gap, convective transition mass, Hα emission, Ca ii H and K activity

总结:
Gaia Data Release 2中发现了M矮星间隙现象，也称为Jao Gap，它表现为主序线上在与对流转变质量（约0.35 M⊙）附近的一小段明度范围内，星体密度减少了17%。之前的研究表明，太阳附近的恒星在Jao Gap的G亮度附近存在Hα发射的缺乏现象。作者推测，这一现象可能是由于Jao Gap特征形成和恒星辐射性转变区的破坏所导致的恒星磁拓扑的复杂变化。本研究还观察到Ca ii H和K活动与Hα在Jao Gap附近表现出类似的异常行为，活动的恒星间变化增加。研究提出了一个恒星磁场演化的玩具模型，表明这种增加可能是由于Jao Gap形成所驱动的周期混合事件引起的磁场随机破坏。 <div>
The Gaia M dwarf gap, also known as the Jao Gap, is a novel feature discovered in the Gaia Data Release 2 G versus BP-RP color–magnitude diagram. This gap represents a 17% decrease in stellar density in a thin magnitude band around the convective transition mass (∼0.35 M⊙) on the main sequence. Previous work has demonstrated a paucity of Hα emission coincident with the G magnitude of the Jao Gap in the solar neighborhood. The exact mechanism that results in this paucity is as of yet unknown; however, the authors of the originating paper suggest that it may be the result of complex variations to a star’s magnetic topology driven by the Jao Gap’s characteristic formation and breakdown of stars’ radiative transition zones. We present a follow-up investigating another widely used magnetic activity metric, Calcium ii H and K emission. Ca ii H and K activity appears to share a similar anomalous behavior as Hα does near the Jao Gap magnitude. We observe an increase in star-to-star variation of magnetic activity near the Jao Gap. We present a toy model of a star’s magnetic field evolution, which demonstrates that this increase may be due to stochastic disruptions to the magnetic field originating from the periodic-mixing events characteristic of the convective kissing instabilities that drive the formation of the Jao Gap.

Due to its powerful capability and high efficiency in big data analysis, machine learning has been applied in various fields. We construct a neural network platform to constrain the behaviors of the equation of state of nuclear matter with respect to the properties of nuclear matter at saturation density and the properties of neutron stars. It is found that the neural network is able to give reasonable predictions of parameter space and provide new hints into the constraints of hadron interactions. As a specific example, we take the relativistic mean field approximation in a widely accepted Walecka-type model to illustrate the feasibility and efficiency of the platform. The results show that the neural network can indeed estimate the parameters of the model at a certain precision such that both the properties of nuclear matter around saturation density and global properties of neutron stars can be saturated. The optimization of the present modularly designed neural network and extension to other effective models is straightforward.

总结: 
这篇文章报道了对X3Σ−基态的氘化分子离子SD+进行了实验室测量，并确定了其旋转、离心畸变、自旋-自旋相互作用和超精细结构常数。通过这些参数，提供了SD+的准确亚毫米波静止频率，以便在天文学上进行探测。研究人员利用Atacama大型毫米/亚毫米阵列(ALMA)对PKS 1830-211夸萨的SD+吸收线进行了调查，确定了分子吸收线的上限总柱密度为3 × 1012 cm−2。 <div>
Seven rotational and fine-structure transitions of the deuterated molecular ion SD+ in the X3Σ− ground electronic state have been measured in the 271–863 GHz region in the laboratory. This ion has been produced by direct-current glow discharge using a mixture of D2S and argon in a free space cell in a temperature range of −140°C to −160°C. The rotational, centrifugal distortion, spin–spin interaction, and hyperfine constants have been determined; the standard deviation of the residuals in the fitting is 109 kHz. The set of obtained spectroscopic parameters provides a list of accurate submillimeter rest frequencies of SD+ for astronomical detection. We have investigated lines of SD+ toward the quasar PKS 1830-211 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array archive, as the z = 0.89 molecular absorber exists in front of this quasar. A data set covering the 297 GHz region includes the NJ = 23–12 transition at 561 GHz due to redshift, providing an upper limit of the column density Ntot = 3 × 1012 cm−2 for SD+.

总结: <br />
这项研究利用2015年5月至2018年6月的Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS)任务的高分辨率测量数据，统计性地研究了磁层边界层中小尺度场向电流（SFACs）的性质。共成功识别了2235个SFACs，它们的持续时间主要在0.2到0.3秒之间，宽度大多小于1个离子惯性长度，主要分布在5到25个电子惯性长度之间。SFACs的主要载体是电子，超过70%的SFACs表现出净能量耗散，其中大部分能量耗散发生在平行方向。SFACs在空间上分布广泛，且在靠近磁层的边界层中发生率更高。此外，不到一半的SFACs出现在众所周知的结构中，约54%的SFACs出现在“其他”未知结构中。这些结果提高了我们对磁层边界层中电流系统和SFACs在太阳风和磁层耦合中的作用的理解。 <div>
Based on high-resolution measurements from the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission from 2015 May to 2018 June, we statistically investigate the properties of small-scale field-aligned currents (SFACs) in the magnetopause boundary layer. A total of 2235 SFACs are successfully identified. The durations of SFACs mainly fall between 0.2 and 0.3 s. Over 90% of SFACs have a width of less than 1 ion inertia length and are primarily distributed from 5 to 25 electron inertia lengths, implying that the SFACs belong to the kinetic-scale current layer. The main carriers of SFACs are electrons, and over 70% of SFACs exhibit net energy dissipation (i.e., J · E′ > 0) with the majority of energy dissipation taking place in the parallel direction. SFACs are widely distributed spatially, and the occurrence rate of SFACs is higher in the boundary layer closer to the magnetosphere. Additionally, less than half of the total SFACs are identified in well-known structures, including the magnetic reconnection region, flux transfer event, Kelvin–Helmholtz vortex, and exhaust region, and 54% of the SFACs are in the “others” unknown structures. These results improve our comprehension of the current system at the magnetopause and the roles of SFACs in the coupling between the solar wind and magnetosphere.

本文详细计算了宇宙γ射线与太阳光子相互作用，产生电子-正电子对的吸收光学深度。该效应在距离太阳较近的γ射线源处最为显著，吸收光学深度可高达τγγ ∼ 10−2。文章还考虑了亚光速Lorentz不变性（LIV）对吸收截面阈值的影响，首次展示亚光速LIV可导致τγγ与非LIV情况相比增加或减少。研究表明，至少在原理上，可通过HAWC或LHAASO在≳20 TeV的能量范围内观测太阳附近γ射线源，探测LIV效应，尽管由于效应规模微小，测量将极为困难。 <div>
We compute in detail the absorption optical depth for astrophysical γ-ray photons interacting with solar photons to produce electron–positron pairs. This effect is greatest for γ-ray sources at small angular distances from the Sun, reaching optical depths as high as τγγ ∼ 10−2. We also calculate this effect including modifications to the absorption cross-section threshold from subluminal Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). We show for the first time that subluminal LIV can lead to increases or decreases in τγγ compared to the non-LIV case. We show that, at least in principle, LIV can be probed with this effect with observations of γ-ray sources near the Sun at ≳20 TeV by HAWC or LHAASO, although a measurement will be extremely difficult due to the small size of the effect.

总结:<br />
研究报告了最近十年发现的第一个轴向射流式潮汐破坏事件（TDE）AT2022cmc，也是迄今为止已知的第四个轴向射流式TDE候选者。研究团队对AT2022cmc进行了NuSTAR硬X射线（3-30 keV）观测，并使用NICER、Swift和XMM-Newton获得了软X射线（0.3-6 keV）观测。他们的分析表明，这个宽带X射线光谱可以很好地用fν ∝ ν−0.5（fν ∝ ν−1）来描述，其中ν−0.5（ν−1）在观测者框架中的Ebk ∼ 10 keV的休息能量以下（以上）。他们的模型实现了广义洛伦兹因子的约束，表明射流的核心洛伦兹因子大约为10-100。他们的解释对其他来源如γ射线暴的相对论射流的性质有广泛的影响。这种性质不同于Pasham等人提出的模型，后者认为无线电和X射线来自于物质为主导的射流中的同一发射区。 <div>
AT2022cmc was recently reported as the first on-axis jetted tidal disruption event (TDE) discovered in the last decade, and the fourth on-axis jetted TDE candidate known so far. In this work, we present NuSTAR hard X-ray (3–30 keV) observations of AT2022cmc, as well as soft X-ray (0.3–6 keV) observations obtained by NICER, Swift, and XMM-Newton. Our analysis reveals that the broadband X-ray spectra can be well described by a broken power law with fν ∝ ν−0.5 (fν ∝ ν−1) below (above) the rest-frame break energy of Ebk ∼ 10 keV at the observer frame tobs = 7.8 and 17.6 days since discovery. At tobs = 36.2 days, the X-ray spectrum is consistent with either a single power law or a broken power law. By modeling the spectral energy distribution from radio to hard X-ray across the three NuSTAR observing epochs, we find that the submillimeter/radio emission originates from external shocks at large distances ≳1017 cm from the black hole, the UV/optical light comes from a thermal envelope with radius ∼1015 cm, and the X-ray emission is consistent with synchrotron radiation powered by energy dissipation at intermediate radii within the (likely magnetically dominated) jet. We constrain the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet to be of the order 10–100. Our interpretation differs from the model proposed by Pasham et al. where both the radio and X-rays come from the same emitting zone in a matter-dominated jet. Our model for the jet X-ray emission has broad implications on the nature of relativistic jets in other sources such as gamma-ray bursts.

Mirror stars are a generic prediction of dissipative dark matter (DM) models, including minimal atomic DM and twin baryons in the mirror twin Higgs model. Mirror stars can capture regular matter from the interstellar medium through extremely suppressed kinetic mixing interactions between the regular and the dark photon. This accumulated “nugget” will draw heat from the mirror star core and emit highly characteristic X-ray and optical signals. In this work, we devise a general parameterization of mirror star nugget properties that is independent of the unknown details of mirror star stellar physics, and use the Cloudy spectral synthesis code to obtain realistic and comprehensive predictions for the thermal emissions from optically thin mirror star nuggets. We find that mirror star nuggets populate an extremely well-defined and narrow region of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram that only partially overlaps with the white dwarf population. Our detailed spectral predictions, which we make publicly available, allow us to demonstrate that optically thin nuggets can be clearly distinguished from white dwarf stars by their continuum spectrum shape, and from planetary nebulae and other optically thin standard sources by their highly exotic emission-line ratios. Our work will enable realistic mirror star telescope searches, which may reveal the detailed nature of DM.

<div> 关键词: 太阳X射线光谱仪、高分辨率、铁离子、太阳耀斑、光谱数据分析

总结: 
太阳X射线光谱仪在Hinotori任务期间观测得到了高分辨率的光谱数据，用于研究太阳耀斑中高度电离铁离子的发射线。研究对数据进行了单温度拟合，并与理论预测进行了比较。结果表明，在特定波长范围内，通过使用从j/w强度比估算的单电子温度进行的合成光谱拟合效果良好。此外，还推导出观测线比的经验关系，并根据观察到的线比估计了Fe+25/Fe+24的离子分数。最后指出，Fe xxv线比的系统过量可能暗示了原子参数或原子建模的问题。 <div>
High-resolution spectra observed by the Solar X-ray spectrometer on board the Hinotori mission are revisited. Flat crystals slightly offset to the satellite spin axis produce automatic spectral scans for emission lines emerging from highly charged iron ions in solar flares every half-spin time period. All the downlinked data of the mission are converted to FITS format and major flare spectral data are revived as IDL save files in ISAS/DARTS. Based on these data sets, single-temperature fits are performed for the emission line complex of highly charged iron ions in the wavelength range of 1.75–1.95 Å and compared with theoretical predictions. Synthetic spectra with single electron temperatures estimated from j/w line-intensity ratios fit fairly well for Fe xxiv and Fe xxiii lines in the wavelength range of 1.85–1.88 Å, while intensity ratios of Fe xxv lines (x, y, z) and the inner-shell excitation line of Fe xxiv (q) to the Fe xxv resonance line (w) have systematic excesses. Empirical relations for the observed line ratios are derived. Ion fractions of Fe+25/Fe+24 estimated by intensity ratios of Lyα/w in the temperature range of log Te=7.25–7.45 are consistent with values in ionization equilibrium, and the remaining excesses of the Fe xxv line ratios may suggest problems with the atomic parameters or atomic modeling.

总结: <br /><br />这篇文章报告了使用Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope的Cryogenic Near-Infrared Spectropolarimeter进行的Si x 1430 nm太阳冠线的委托观测。这是首次对该光谱线进行空间分辨观测，具有作为冠状磁场诊断的潜力。观测目标是2022年3月4日位于太阳东北边缘的复杂活动区。文章对数据进行了初步分析，提取了谱线特性，比较了与Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)仪器的极端紫外观测。同时展示了一种从Si x观测中估算电子密度的方法，以及对该区域的有效温度和非热线宽进行了推导。这项研究为更常规地观测这一有潜力的诊断线提供了校准方法的信息。 <div>
We report commissioning observations of the Si x 1430 nm solar coronal line observed coronagraphically with the Cryogenic Near-Infrared Spectropolarimeter at the National Science Foundation’s Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope. These are the first known spatially resolved observations of this spectral line, which has strong potential as a coronal magnetic field diagnostic. The observations target a complex active region located on the solar northeast limb on 2022 March 4. We present a first analysis of these data that extracts the spectral line properties through a careful treatment of the variable atmospheric transmission that is known to impact this spectral window. Rastered images are created and compared with extreme-UV observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument. A method for estimating the electron density from the Si x observations is then demonstrated that makes use of the forbidden line density-sensitive emissivity and an emission-measure analysis of the SDO/AIA bandpass observations. In addition, we derive an effective temperature and nonthermal line width across the region. This study informs the calibration approaches required for more routine observations of this promising diagnostic line.

基于Solar Cycle 24期间2704次太阳喷发的空间和时间分布，本研究进一步确认了两种不同的日冕喷发分布：一种位于极地区域，另一种位于较低纬度地区。此外，对一系列日冕喷发的分析显示全球太阳磁场存在螺旋振荡。研究北半球和南半球分别显示反相位相关性，可以解释为日冕喷发的全球香肠振荡模式。还研究了太阳活动周期的变化对日冕喷发的幂律指数的影响，但并未发现最大值后指数有显著变化的有力证据。此外，基于大量的太阳喷发数据库，还确认了太阳动力学台阵上的304 Å通道的退化。最后，对太阳日冕喷发数据库中是否存在活跃的经度进行了调查，但没有明显的证据表明存在高概率的活跃经度，因此这个问题仍有待进一步探讨。<br /><br />总结: <br />Solar Cycle 24期间，太阳喷发的空间和时间分布显示出两种不同的模式，同时也观察到了全球太阳磁场的螺旋振荡。此外，研究表明太阳活动周期变化对太阳喷发幂律指数的影响不明显，还指出了太阳动力学台阵上的仪器通道的退化现象。最后，尚未发现明显的活跃经度迹象，仍需进一步研究。 <div>
The focus of this study is on the spatial and temporal distributions of 2704 solar jets throughout Solar Cycle 24, from beginning to end. This work is a follow-up paper by Liu et al. With this extended data set, we have further confirmed the two distinct distributions of coronal jets: one located in polar regions and another at lower latitudes. Further analysis of the series of coronal jets revealed kink oscillations of the global solar magnetic field. Additionally, studying the northern and southern hemispheres separately showed an antiphase correlation that can be interpreted as a global sausage oscillatory pattern of the loci of the coronal jets. We also investigated how the variability of the solar cycle may impact the power law index of coronal jets by dividing the data set into the rising and declining phases of Solar Cycle 24. However, there is no compelling evidence to suggest that the power law index changes after the maximum. It is worth noting that based on this vast database of solar jets, the degradation of the 304 Å channel of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly instrument on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory can also be identified and confirmed. Finally, we searched for compelling signatures of the presence of active longitude in the coronal jet database. There was no obvious evidence with a high probability of an active longitude; therefore, this question remains yet to be addressed further.

总结: <br /><br />文章探讨了光子的质量对宇宙物理和天文学的重要性，研究了光子在等离子体介质中传播的色散关系，借助高精度时间测量数据对光子质量的上限进行了约束，利用无线宽带观测数据和快速射电暴的脉冲来限制光子质量的上限。研究结果表明，光子质量的严格上限为9.52 × 10^-46 kg（5.34 × 10^-10 eV c^-2）。未来需要继续研究光子质量，并利用脉冲星定时数据和无线宽带接收机，或者宽带光谱的快速射电暴来进一步观测。 <div>
Exploring the concept of a massive photon has been an important area in astronomy and physics. If photons have mass, their propagation in nonvacuum space would be affected by both the nonzero mass mγ and the presence of a plasma medium. This would lead to a delay time proportional to , which deviates from the classical dispersion relation (proportional to ν−2). For the first time, we have derived the dispersion relation of a photon with a nonzero mass propagating in plasma. To reduce the impact of variations in the dispersion measure (DM), we employed the high-precision timing data to constrain the upper bound of the photon mass. Specifically, the DM/time of arrival (TOA) uncertainties derived from ultrawide bandwidth (UWB) observations conducted by the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) are used. The dedispersed pulses from fast radio bursts (FRBs) with minimal scattering effects are also used to constrain the upper bound of photon mass. The stringent limit on the photon mass is determined by uncertainties of the TOA of pulsars, with an optimum value of 9.52 × 10−46 kg (5.34 × 10−10 eV c−2). In the future, it is essential to investigate the photon mass, as pulsar timing data are collected by PPTA and UWB receivers, or FRBs with wideband spectra are detected by UWB receivers.

<div> 电子加热, 离子电子冲击, 电动势跳跃, 离子动能, 磁波
总结:
在这篇文章中，研究了在低βp（βp = 0.25）冲击波情况下，通过1D和2D粒子在单元模拟中测量了热电子的能量激发。研究发现，电子加热由双极、B-平行电位跳跃Δϕ∥描述，它与电子温度跳跃大致成线性关系。在模拟中得出的电位跳跃为 -0.2，与之前的测量和模拟结果一致。不考虑离对角线电子压强张量项可能会导致在低βp冲击波中对Δϕ∥的系统低估。此外，研究还关注了两种θBn = 65°的冲击波情况，分别是具有沿B方向的30di鸣波前体的情况和具有倾斜于B的短5di鸣波前体的情况。在鸣波前体中，Δϕ∥随着冲击波朝向呈现出沿多个鸣波波长的逐渐上升，并且在磁场波谷内还具有局部尖峰。对于θBn = 65°的情况的1D模拟显示，Δϕ∥对电子等离子体与回旋频率比值ωpe/Ωce的依赖性较弱，当mi/me增加到真实的质子-电子值1836时，Δϕ∥减少了一倍。 <div>
We measure the thermal electron energization in 1D and 2D particle-in-cell simulations of quasi-perpendicular, low-beta (βp = 0.25) collisionless ion–electron shocks with mass ratio mi/me = 200, fast Mach number –4, and upstream magnetic field angle θBn = 55°–85° from the shock normal . It is known that shock electron heating is described by an ambipolar, B-parallel electric potential jump, Δϕ∥, that scales roughly linearly with the electron temperature jump. Our simulations have –0.2 in units of the pre-shock ions’ bulk kinetic energy, in agreement with prior measurements and simulations. Different ways to measure ϕ∥, including the use of de Hoffmann–Teller frame fields, agree to tens-of-percent accuracy. Neglecting off-diagonal electron pressure tensor terms can lead to a systematic underestimate of ϕ∥ in our low-βp shocks. We further focus on two θBn = 65° shocks: a ( ) case with a long, 30di precursor of whistler waves along , and a ( ) case with a shorter, 5di precursor of whistlers oblique to both and B; di is the ion skin depth. Within the precursors, ϕ∥ has a secular rise toward the shock along multiple whistler wavelengths and also has localized spikes within magnetic troughs. In a 1D simulation of the , θBn = 65° case, ϕ∥ shows a weak dependence on the electron plasma-to-cyclotron frequency ratio ωpe/Ωce, and ϕ∥ decreases by a factor of 2 as mi/me is raised to the true proton–electron value of 1836.

<div> UMa3/U1、暗物质、N-body simulations、LCDM halo、多次观测

UMa3/U1是迄今为止已知的银河系卫星中最微弱的，其质量较小，半光半径为3 ±1 pc。有可能是已发现的最暗淡的星系，或者是围绕银河系轨道上已知最微弱的自引力星团。其视向速度离散性暗示存在暗物质，尽管目前的测量由于未知的潜在双星贡献而不确定。N-body模拟表明，如果是自引力的话，该系统在银河系潮汐场中不可能存活比单次轨道（约0.4 Gyr）更久，这强烈暗示了该系统受到大量暗物质的稳定。如果UMa3/U1在一个约10^9M⊙的线性冷暗物质（LCDM）暗物质晕中形成，则其速度离散度有望预测为大约1 km s^-1。这与目前的估计大致一致，不考虑双星，则将σlos放在1-4 km s^-1的范围内。由于其密集的拱，这样的暗物质晕应该能够在银河系潮汐场中存活下来，使UMa3/U1到目前为止相对完好无损。这意味着UMa3/U1可能是银河系最微弱和最密集的矮星系卫星，对于替代暗物质模型以及LCDM宇宙学中光亮星系形成的最低暗物质晕质量阈值都有重要影响。我们的研究呼吁进行多次高分辨率光谱跟进观测以确认这一非凡系统的暗物质含量。<br /><br />总结:UMa3/U1是银河系中最微弱的卫星系统之一，其中可能存在大量暗物质，对于宇宙学和星系形成模型有重要影响。我们需要进行多次观测以确认其暗物质成分。 <div>
The recently discovered stellar system Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 (UMa3/U1) is the faintest known Milky Way satellite to date. With a stellar mass of and a half-light radius of 3 ± 1 pc, it is either the darkest galaxy ever discovered or the faintest self-gravitating star cluster known to orbit the Galaxy. Its line-of-sight velocity dispersion suggests the presence of dark matter, although current measurements are inconclusive because of the unknown contribution to the dispersion of potential binary stars. We use N-body simulations to show that, if self-gravitating, the system could not survive in the Milky Way tidal field for much longer than a single orbit (roughly 0.4 Gyr), which strongly suggests that the system is stabilized by the presence of large amounts of dark matter. If UMa3/U1 formed at the center of a ∼109M⊙ cuspy LCDM halo, its velocity dispersion would be predicted to be of order ∼1 km s−1. This is roughly consistent with the current estimate, which, neglecting binaries, places σlos in the range 1–4 km s−1. Because of its dense cusp, such a halo should be able to survive the Milky Way tidal field, keeping UMa3/U1 relatively unscathed until the present time. This implies that UMa3/U1 is plausibly the faintest and densest dwarf galaxy satellite of the Milky Way, with important implications for alternative dark matter models and for the minimum halo mass threshold for luminous galaxy formation in the LCDM cosmology. Our results call for multi-epoch high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up to confirm the dark matter content of this extraordinary system.

<br />总结:
本研究使用哈勃空间望远镜对孤立、抑制的矮星系Tucana中374颗红巨星分支恒星的金属丰度进行测量。研究发现了Tucana的全局金属丰度分布功能，以及其金属丰度梯度。Tucana的红巨星分支呈现出两个不同的金属丰度分布，与银河系卫星相比，Tucana在固定恒星质量下更为富含金属。此外，约有2%的Tucana恒星的铁丰度低于-3%，而20%的恒星的铁丰度高于-1%。这项研究为社区提供了进行光谱后续观测的目录。 <div>
We measure the metallicities of 374 red giant branch (RGB) stars in the isolated, quenched dwarf galaxy Tucana using Hubble Space Telescope narrowband (F395N) calcium H and K imaging. Our sample is a factor of ∼7 larger than what is available from previous studies. Our main findings are as follows. (i) A global metallicity distribution function (MDF) with and . (ii) A metallicity gradient of −0.54 ± 0.07 dex (−2.1 ± 0.3 dex kpc−1) over the extent of our imaging (∼2.5 Re), which is steeper than literature measurements. Our finding is consistent with predicted gradients from the publicly available FIRE-2 simulations, in which bursty star formation creates stellar population gradients and dark matter cores. (iii) Tucana’s bifurcated RGB has distinct metallicities: a blue RGB with and and a red RGB with and . (iv) At fixed stellar mass, Tucana is more metal-rich than Milky Way satellites by ∼0.4 dex, but its blue RGB is chemically comparable to the satellites. Tucana’s MDF appears consistent with star-forming isolated dwarfs, though MDFs of the latter are not as well populated. (v) About 2% of Tucana’s stars have [Fe/H] < −3% and 20% have [Fe/H] > −1. We provide a catalog for community spectroscopic follow-up.

<br />
这篇文章介绍了一种新的前向建模工具——Broad Emission Line MApping Code，该工具可以模拟宽发射线区域对任何给定输入光变曲线的速度分辨的回响响应。通过模拟以母线驱动的大气流的球状BLR和具有开普勒旋转的盘状BLR的一组模型对单个光谱脉冲的速度响应，我们计算了响应加权的时间延迟（反射“滞后”），这被认为是BLR的光度加权半径的代理。我们发现，当云层以各向同性发射并且是辐射为主时（部分电离）时，响应加权的延迟才等价于光度加权的半径。否则，光度加权的半径可能会被高估多达两倍。 
<br /><br />总结: <div>
The variable continuum emission of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) produces corresponding responses in the broad emission lines, which are modulated by light travel delays, and contain information on the physical properties, structure, and kinematics of the emitting gas region. The reverberation mapping technique, a time series analysis of the driving light curve and response, can recover some of this information, including the size and velocity field of the broad-line region (BLR). Here we introduce a new forward-modeling tool, the Broad Emission Line MApping Code, which simulates the velocity-resolved reverberation response of the BLR to any given input light curve by setting up a 3D ensemble of gas clouds for various specified geometries, velocity fields, and cloud properties. In this work, we present numerical approximations to the transfer function by simulating the velocity-resolved responses to a single continuum pulse for sets of models representing a spherical BLR with a radiatively driven outflow and a disklike BLR with Keplerian rotation. We explore how the structure, velocity field, and other BLR properties affect the transfer function. We calculate the response-weighted time delay (reverberation “lag”), which is considered to be a proxy for the luminosity-weighted radius of the BLR. We investigate the effects of anisotropic cloud emission and matter-bounded (completely ionized) clouds and find the response-weighted delay is only equivalent to the luminosity-weighted radius when clouds emit isotropically and are radiation-bounded (partially ionized). Otherwise, the luminosity-weighted radius can be overestimated by up to a factor of 2.

总结:<br />
本研究通过对未来的鲁宾天文台遗产空间与时间调查（LSST）的模拟光变曲线进行分析，预测了二进制超大质量黑洞在这项调查中的可检测性。研究发现，虽然固有变异性可能导致对两个黑洞的干扰，但对于大部分的潜在二进制光变曲线，二进制信号的周期和相位可以被辨别出来。然而，由于赛弗尔星系核的固有变异性，二进制幅度被高估且难以恢复。此外，最亮的赛弗尔星系核模拟光变曲线的假阳性率高达60％。因此，使用光度周期性进行纯电磁探测的二进制样本中将存在大量的假阳性。本研究为了解鲁宾所发现的二进制候选者的真实和假阳性率提供了一种重要且经济的方法。 <div>
Periodic signatures in time-domain observations of quasars have been used to search for binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs). These searches, across existing time-domain surveys, have produced several hundred candidates. The general stochastic variability of quasars, however, can masquerade as a false-positive periodic signal, especially when monitoring cadence and duration are limited. In this work, we predict the detectability of binary SMBHs in the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We apply computationally inexpensive sinusoidal curve fits to millions of simulated LSST Deep Drilling Field light curves of both single, isolated quasars and binary quasars. The period and phase of simulated binary signals can generally be disentangled from quasar variability. Binary amplitude is overestimated and poorly recovered for two-thirds of potential binaries due to quasar accretion variability. Quasars with strong intrinsic variability can obscure a binary signal too much for recovery. We also find that the most luminous quasars mimic current binary candidate light curves and their properties: The false-positive rates are 60% for these quasars. The reliable recovery of binary period and phase for a wide range of input binary LSST light curves is promising for multi-messenger characterization of binary SMBHs. However, pure electromagnetic detections of binaries using photometric periodicity with amplitude greater than 0.1 mag will result in samples that are overwhelmed by false positives. This paper represents an important and computationally inexpensive way forward for understanding the true and false-positive rates for binary candidates identified by Rubin.

总结: 
1. 介绍了Perseus星系团作为X射线天空中最亮的星系团的特点及其对研究星系团内部介质的重要性。
2. 提到了以前由于NuSTAR点扩散函数的延伸翼和AGN的活跃性使得对Perseus星系团中心附近的弥散辐射的研究几乎不可能进行。
3. 介绍了新开发的nucrossarf开源软件包，允许对点源和弥散源的贡献进行建模，以便考虑AGN的散射光。
4. 对使用NuSTAR对Perseus星系团进行的弥散硬X射线（3-25keV）辐射分析的结果进行了概述，发现了超出20keV的约10%的辐射过量。
5. 讨论了这种过量的潜在起源和影响，并提出了对nucrossarf系统不确定性的表征，这对未来的工作可能有用。 <div>
As the brightest galaxy cluster in the X-ray sky, Perseus is an excellent target for studying the intracluster medium (ICM), but until recently, its active galactic nucleus (AGN) made studies of the diffuse emission near its center nearly impossible to accomplish with NuSTAR, due to the extended wings of NuSTAR's point-spread function. The development of a new open-source software package—nucrossarf—now allows the contribution from point and diffuse sources to be modeled so that scattered light from the AGN can be accounted for. Using this technique, we present an analysis of diffuse hard X-ray (3–25 keV) emission from the ICM using three archival NuSTAR observations of the Perseus cluster. We find a ∼10% excess of emission beyond 20 keV not describable by purely thermal models. By performing similar analyses of AGNs in archival observations, we have characterized the systematic uncertainty of the modeled AGN contribution to be 3.4%. However, in order to explain the excess, the total scattered AGN emission would have to be 39% stronger than we have measured. We test physical explanations for the excess, such as diffuse inverse-Compton emission potentially originating from the radio mini-halo, but we determine that none of the models are compelling. An upper limit on the inverse-Compton flux (≤1.5 × 10−11 erg s−1 cm−2) and a corresponding lower limit on the global magnetic field strength (≥0.35 μG) are derived. We discuss the potential origin and implications of the excess and present our characterization of the nucrossarf systematic uncertainty, which should be useful for future work.

星际分子的SMA映射显示，NGC 3132的南环主要、明亮的分子丰富环是正在膨胀的环，而不是边缘明亮的壳，这表明NGC 3132是一个基本上面向极点的双极星云。SMA数据还显示星云内存在一个几乎与主要分子环正交的第二个膨胀分子环。作者认为，这种两环结构是星云的椭球分子气体包的遗迹，是原恒星渐近巨星分支演化结束后被一个或多个伴星相互作用形成的不对齐快速集束流所破坏的结果。 <br /><br />总结: 星际分子的SMA映射显示NGC 3132的主要分子环是正在膨胀的环而非壳，表明NGC 3132是一个双极星云。此外，通过SMA数据还发现了一个几乎与主要分子环正交的第二个膨胀分子环，作者认为这是由于快速集束流与原恒星和伴星之间相互作用导致的椭球分子气体包的遗迹。 <div>
We present Submillimeter Array (SMA) mapping of 12CO J = 2 → 1, 13CO J = 2 → 1, and CN N = 2 → 1 emission from the ring-like planetary nebula NGC 3132, one of the subjects of JWST Early Release Observation near-infrared imaging. The ∼5″ resolution SMA data demonstrate that the Southern Ring’s main, bright, molecule-rich ring is indeed an expanding ring, as opposed to a limb-brightened shell, in terms of its intrinsic (physical) structure. This suggests that NGC 3132 is a bipolar nebula viewed more or less pole-on (inclination ∼15°–30°). The SMA data furthermore reveal that the nebula harbors a second expanding molecular ring that is aligned almost orthogonally to the main, bright molecular ring. We propose that this two-ring structure is the remnant of an ellipsoidal molecular envelope of ejecta that terminated the progenitor star’s asymptotic giant branch evolution and was subsequently disrupted by a series of misaligned fast, collimated outflows or jets resulting from interactions between the progenitor and one or more companions.

<div> CMB dipole, kinematic origin, large-scale structure, NVSS catalog, ΛCDM cosmological model
<br /><br />总结:本研究重新评估了来自NVSS目录的偶极估计与CMB测量之间的明显不一致。研究发现，在确定预期的偶极信号时，考虑NVSS源的shot noise和聚类以及运动贡献至关重要。我们使用了聚类红移方法和交叉匹配技术来优化聚类项的估计。然后，在标准的ΛCDM宇宙学模型中，包括所有（即运动、shot noise和聚类）偶极分量，推导出了NVSS偶极的概率分布。我们的模型与以往大部分文献中的NVSS偶极测量基本一致，精度达到或优于2σ。我们得出结论，NVSS偶极与CMB偶极的运动起源在ΛCDM模型内是一致的。 <div>
The dipole moment in the angular distribution of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is thought to originate from the doppler effect and our motion relative to the CMB frame. Observations of large-scale structure (LSS) should show a related “kinematic dipole” and help test the kinematic origin of the CMB dipole. Intriguingly, many previous LSS dipole studies suggest discrepancies with the expectations from the CMB. Here, we reassess the apparent inconsistency between the CMB measurements and dipole estimates from the NVSS catalog of radio sources. We find that it is important to account for the shot noise and clustering of the NVSS sources, as well as kinematic contributions, in determining the expected dipole signal. We use the clustering redshift method and a cross-matching technique to refine estimates of the clustering term. We then derive a probability distribution for the expected NVSS dipole in a standard ΛCDM cosmological model including all (i.e., kinematic, shot noise, and clustering) dipole components. Our model agrees with most of the previous NVSS dipole measurements in the literature at better than ≲2σ. We conclude that the NVSS dipole is consistent with a kinematic origin for the CMB dipole within ΛCDM.

<div> H i 21 cm, CO line intensity maps, density field, reionization, cosmological initial density distribution
<br /><br />总结:
本文提出了一种通过观测高红移时期的H i 21 cm和CO线强度图来重建宇宙初始密度分布的方法。H i 21 cm和CO线强度图提供了关于密度场的互补信息，H i 21 cm场是中性区域的物质分布的代理，而CO线强度图对高密度的星形成区域敏感，这些区域是再电离源。通过共轭梯度法和代价函数最小化的方式，通过分析得到代价函数的梯度的解析表达式来实现密度场的重建。研究结果显示，通过半数值模拟再电离的输入图来重新模拟的强度图在再电离的所有阶段具有小于7%的均方根误差。这种重建方法在CO图上应用了一个乐观的水平的射线噪声或者每幅图应用了小于标准偏差的10%的白噪声时，仍然表现出了约10%的均方根误差的鲁棒性。这个概念验证的工作证明了重建方法的稳健性，从而提供了一种从高红移观测中重建宇宙初始密度分布的有效技术。 <div>
The initial density distribution provides a basis for understanding the complete evolution of cosmological density fluctuations. While reconstruction in our local Universe exploits the observations of galaxy surveys with large volumes, observations of high-redshift galaxies are performed with a small field of view and therefore can hardly be used for reconstruction. Here, we propose reconstructing the initial density field using the H i 21 cm and CO line intensity maps from the epoch of reionization. Observations of these two intensity maps provide complementary information on the density field—the H i 21 cm field is a proxy of matter distributions in the neutral regions, while the CO line intensity maps are sensitive to the high-density, star-forming regions that host the sources for reionization. Technically, we employ the conjugate gradient method and develop the machinery for minimizing the cost function for the intensity mapping observations. Analytical expressions for the gradient of cost function are derived explicitly. We show that the resimulated intensity maps match the input maps of mock observations using semi-numerical simulations of reionization with an rms error ≲7% at all stages of reionization. This reconstruction is also robust with an rms error of ∼10% when an optimistic level of shot noise is applied to the CO map or white noise at the level of ≲10% of the standard deviation is applied to each map. Our proof-of-concept work demonstrates the robustness of the reconstruction method, thereby providing an effective technique for reconstructing the cosmological initial density distribution from high-redshift observations.

<title>Sensitivity of the Helioglow to Variation of the Total Ionization Rate and Solar Lyα Emission</title>

<div> 关键词: 太阳风, 观测, 光谱, IMAP 任务, 氢原子离子

总结:
太阳风观测受限于黄道平面附近，IMAP任务计划的GLOWS仪器旨在通过观测星际中性氢的反散射辉光，间接获取太阳风的纬度结构。研究发现，太阳光照的变化会立即反映在辉光上，但其调整时间比变化上升时间更长。相反，星际氢的电离率变化会与辉光亮度呈反相关，并且存在数月的延迟。此外，辉光对于太阳极地区的电离率变化不敏感，因此需要使用适当的参数函数来近似电离率剖面，以检测极地区的电离率和太阳风变化。 <div>
Direct observations of solar wind are mostly limited to the vicinity of the ecliptic plane. Retrieving the latitudinal structure of solar wind indirectly based on observations of the backscatter glow of interstellar neutral hydrogen is complex and requires support from theoretical models. The GLOWS instrument, to operate on the planned IMAP mission, will scan the helioglow along circumsolar rings with an angular distance of ∼75°. Its objective is to retrieve the latitudinal structure of the ionization rate of interstellar hydrogen and with this the structure of the solar wind. In preparation for the future analysis, we studied the sensitivity of the light curves to temporal and latitudinal variation of the ionization rate of interstellar hydrogen and the solar Lyα illumination. Based on carefully planned numerical experiments, we analyze the time delay and relaxation time of the system for variations of the ionization rate and solar illumination in heliolatitude and with time. We found that variations in the solar illumination are reflected in the helioglow without delay, but relaxation takes longer than the variation rise time. By contrast, variations in the ionization rate are anticorrelated with the helioglow brightness with a delay of several months. We also found that the helioglow is not sensitive to variations in the ionization rate at the solar poles, so retrieving the ionization rate and solar wind at the poles requires approximation of the ionization rate profiles with appropriate parametric functions.

<title>Spatial Variations of Dust Opacity and Grain Growth in Dark Clouds: L1689, L1709, and L1712</title>

The far-infrared (FIR) opacity of dust in dark clouds within the Ophiuchus molecular cloud is investigated through multiwavelength infrared observations from UKIDSS, Spitzer, and Herschel. Employing the infrared color excess technique with both near-infrared and mid-infrared photometric data, a high-resolution extinction map in the K band (AK) is constructed for three dark clouds: L1689, L1709, and L1712. The derived extinction map has a resolution of and reaches a depth of AK ∼ 3 mag. The FIR optical depths τ250 at a reference wavelength of 250 μm are obtained by fitting the Herschel PACS and SPIRE continuum data at 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 μm using a modified blackbody model. The average dust opacity per unit gas mass at 250 μm, rκ250, is determined through a pixel-by-pixel correlation of τ250 with AK, yielding a value of approximately 0.09 cm2 g−1, which is about 2–3 times higher than the typical value in the diffuse interstellar medium. Additionally, an independent analysis across 16 subregions within the Ophiuchus cloud indicates spatial variations in dust opacity, with values ranging from 0.07 to 0.12 cm2 g−1. Although the observed trend of increasing dust opacity with higher extinction implies grain growth, our findings indicate that rapid grain growth has clearly not yet occurred in the dark clouds studied in this work.
