<div> 盘状星系、寿命分布、Weibull分布、星际盘消退、行星形成模型
<br><br>这篇文章讨论了原行星盘的寿命分布，指出了不同星际盘的存在时间差异，提出了Weibull分布用于描述寿命分布的可能性，重点讨论了低质量恒星（谱型M3.7至M6，Ms≈0.1–0.24 M⊙）的盘寿命。结果表明，在初始盘分数为0.65时，Weibull分布（k = 2.34，λ = 11.22）和高斯分布（σ = 9.52，μ = 9.52）能较好地拟合观测数据。最终挑战是量化盘的寿命多样性与行星多样性之间的联系。 <br> <div>
While most protoplanetary disks lose their gas within less than 10 Myr, individual disk lifetimes vary from <1 Myr to ≫20 Myr, with some disks existing for 40 Myr. Mean disk half-lifetimes hide this diversity; only a so-far nonexisting disk lifetime distribution could capture this fact. The benefit of a disk lifetime distribution would be twofold. First, it would provide a stringent test on disk evolution theories. Second, it could function as an input for planet formation models. Here, we derive such a disk lifetime distribution. We heuristically test different standard distribution forms for their ability to account for the observed disk fractions at certain ages. We here concentrate on the distribution for low-mass stars (spectral types M3.7–M6, Ms ≈ 0.1–0.24 M⊙) because disk lifetimes depend on stellar mass. A Weibull-type distribution (k = 1.78, λ = 9.15) describes the observational data if all stars have a disk at a cluster age tc = 0. However, a better match exists for lower initial disk fractions. For f(t=0) = 0.65, a Weibull distribution (k = 2.34, λ = 11.22) and a Gaussian distribution (σ = 9.52, μ = 9.52) fit the data similarly well. All distributions have in common that they are wide, and most disks are dissipated at ages >5 Myr. The next challenge is to quantitatively link the diversity of disk lifetimes to the diversity in planets.

<div> 关键词: CMEs, CAT-PUMA, 机器学习算法, 地球影响, 太空天气

总结:<br><br>研究团队开发了一个名为CAT-PUMA的工具，利用机器学习算法，通过监督学习对CME的到达时间和地球影响进行预测。他们使用了回归模型和分类模型来进行CME到达时间的预测和地球影响的分类。这种应用提供了关于太空天气事件地球影响的定量指示。研究发现，机器学习模型在回归和分类任务中表现良好，但实际潜力和应用并不总是直观的。为了解决这一挑战，他们使用了模型解释技术，特别是Shap值，以获得对这些模型影响的定量洞见。 <div>
Space weather phenomena have long captured the attention of the scientific community, and along with recent technological developments, the awareness that such phenomena can interfere with human activities on Earth has grown considerably. Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are among the main drivers of space weather. Therefore, developing tools to provide information on their arrival at Earth's nearby space has become increasingly important. Liu et al. developed a tool, called CME Arrival Time Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms (CAT-PUMA), to obtain fast and accurate predictions of CME transit time. This present work aims at the expansion of the CAT-PUMA concept, employing supervised learning to obtain vital information about the arrival of CMEs at Earth. In this study, we report the results of our work following the implementation of supervised regression and classification models in the CAT-PUMA framework. We conducted a comparison of various machine learning models in the context of predicting the transit time of CMEs and classifying CMEs as either Earth impacting or non-impacting. In this way, we are able to provide information on the possibility of a CME reaching Earth relying on CME features and solar wind parameters measured at take-off. This application thus provides quantitative indications about the geoeffectiveness of these space weather events. While machine-learning models can demonstrate fairly strong performance in regression and classification tasks, it is not always straightforward to extrapolate their practical potential and real-world applicability. To address this challenge, we employed model interpretation techniques, specifically Shap values, to gain quantitative insights into the limitations that affect these models.

<title>The Magnetic Field in the Colliding Filaments G202.3+2.5</title>

总结:
本研究使用James Clerk Maxwell望远镜对星云G202.3+2.5进行了热尘埃极化观测，发现平均磁场方向与纤维垂直，并在四个子区域显示不同的行为。利用IRAM观测获得的动力学信息，估计了平面磁场强度，并在四个区域中进行了相关重要性研究。此外，研究了DCF和ADF方法在投影效应上的影响。根据模拟案例发现，当使用DCF或ADF方法时，3D磁场强度可能低估了约3倍，可能进一步低估/高估相关参数。 <br /><br /> <div>
We observe the magnetic field morphology toward a nearby star-forming filamentary cloud, G202.3+2.5, using James Clerk Maxwell Telescope/POL-2 850 μm thermal dust polarization observations with an angular resolution of 14.″4 (∼0.053 pc). The average magnetic field orientation is found to be perpendicular to the filaments, while showing different behaviors in the four subregions, suggesting various effects from the filaments’ collision in these subregions. With the kinematics obtained by the observation by IRAM, we estimate the plane-of-sky magnetic field strength by two methods, the classical Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi (DCF) method and the angular dispersion function (ADF) method, giving Bpos,dcf and Bpos,adf of ∼90 and ∼53 μG. We study the relative importance between the gravity (G), magnetic field (B), and turbulence (T) in the four subregions, and find G > T > B, G ≥ T > B, G ∼ T > B, and T > G > B in the north tail, west trunk, south root, and east wing, respectively. In addition, we investigate the projection effects on the DCF and ADF methods, based on a similar simulation case, and find the 3D magnetic field strength may be underestimated by a factor of ∼3 if applying the widely used statistical Bpos-to-B3D factor when using the DCF or ADF methods, which may further underestimate/overestimate the related parameters.

<div> 关键词: EROs, 红外相机, 光谱能量分布, 高红移, 星系演化

总结: 一项最新研究发现了一群极端红色天体(EROs)，它们是由詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜发现的，在红外摄像机的颜色上具有双峰光谱能量分布(SEDs)，并且具有高红移。研究发现这些EROs可能是包含尘埃的星系或者被遮蔽的活动星系核(AGN)，但无法确定它们的确切特征。此外，研究指出如果这些EROs被确认为高红移的类星体，将导致先前关于高红移的数量密度增加达60倍。因此，未来需要在中红外波段进行进一步的研究以确定这些EROs的真实性质和将其置于恰当的星系演化背景中。<br /><br /> <div>
We study a new population of extremely red objects (EROs) recently discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) based on their NIRCam colors F277W − F444W > 1.5 mag. We find 37 EROs in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) field with F444W < 28 mag and photometric redshifts between 5 < z < 7, with median . Surprisingly, despite their red long-wavelength colors, these EROs have blue short-wavelength colors (F150W − F200W ∼ 0 mag) indicative of bimodal spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with a red, steep slope in the rest-frame optical, and a blue, flat slope in the rest-frame UV. Moreover, all these EROs are unresolved, point-like sources in all NIRCam bands. We analyze the SEDs of eight of them with MIRI and NIRSpec observations using stellar population models and active galactic nucleus (AGN) templates. We find that dusty galaxies or obscured AGNs provide similarly good SED fits but different stellar properties: massive and dusty, ∼ 10 and AV ≳ 3 mag, or low mass and obscured, ∼ 7.5 and AV ∼ 0 mag, hosting an obscured quasi-stellar object (QSO). SED modeling does not favor either scenario, but their unresolved sizes are more suggestive of AGNs. If any EROs are confirmed to have ≳ 10.5, it would increase the pre-JWST number density at z > 7 by up to a factor ∼60. Similarly, if they are QSOs with luminosities in the Lbol > 1045–46 erg s−1 range, their number would exceed that of bright blue QSOs by more than three orders of magnitude. Additional photometry at mid-infrared wavelengths will reveal the true nature of the red continuum emission in these EROs and will place this puzzling population in the right context of galaxy evolution.

<div> WR 137, JWST, NIRISS, AMI, dust formation
总结:
WR 137是一个大质量双星系统，研究了其通过JWST的NIRISS的AMI观测新形成的尘埃。通过三种独立的软件工具对观测数据进行了分析和校准，并使用三种独立的软件工具进行了图像重建。观测结果显示WR 137中心有一个明亮的核心和一个向西北方向延伸的约300毫角秒的线性丝状结构。通过对碰撞风尘埃凝结的分析，研究表明WR 137的尘埃形成在轨道平面内，由O9伴星增强的赤道质量流失引起。 <div>
We present infrared aperture-masking interferometry (AMI) observations of newly formed dust from the colliding winds of the massive binary Wolf–Rayet system WR 137 with JWST using the Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS). NIRISS AMI observations of WR 137 and a point-spread function calibrator star, HD 228337, were taken using the F380M and F480M filters in 2022 July and August as part of the Director’s Discretionary Early Release Science program #1349. Interferometric observables (squared visibilities and closure phases) from the WR 137 “interferogram” were extracted and calibrated using three independent software tools: ImPlaneIA, AMICAL, and SAMpip. The analysis of the calibrated observables yielded consistent values except for slightly discrepant closure phases measured by ImPlaneIA. Based on all three sets of calibrated observables, images were reconstructed using three independent software tools: BSMEM, IRBis, and SQUEEZE. All reconstructed image combinations generated consistent images in both F380M and F480M filters. The reconstructed images of WR 137 reveal a bright central core with a ∼300 mas linear filament extending to the northwest. A geometric colliding-wind model with dust production constrained to the orbital plane of the binary system and enhanced as the system approaches periapsis provided a general agreement with the interferometric observables and reconstructed images. Based on a colliding-wind dust condensation analysis, we suggest that dust formation within the orbital plane of WR 137 is induced by enhanced equatorial mass loss from the rapidly rotating O9 companion star, whose axis of rotation is aligned with that of the orbit.

<div> 关键词: Hα emission, integral field spectroscopy, supernova, SN ejecta, SNR<br />
总结: 
Hα发射，代表着年轻的超新星残骸（SNR），通过积分视场光谱学研究，19个区域符合要求，其中四个位置与先前发现的超新星相匹配，推测这些物体是由超新星喷发物与周围密集物质相互作用而形成的年轻SNR。这些SNR候选的恒星年龄普遍比核心坍缩（CC）超新星的位置年龄低约0.5 dex，表明它们的原型星可能寿命更短、质量更大。这项工作的方法为用积分视场光谱学研究附近的超新星打开了新的研究窗口。 <div>
We present results from a systematic search for broad (≥ 400 km s−1) Hα emission in integral field spectroscopy data cubes of ∼1200 nearby galaxies obtained with PMAS and MUSE. We found 19 unique regions that pass our quality cuts, four of which match the locations of previously discovered supernovae (SNe): one Type IIP and three Type IIn, including the well-known SN 2005ip. We suggest that these objects are young Supernova remnants (SNRs), with bright and broad Hα emission powered by the interaction between the SN ejecta and dense circumstellar material. The stellar ages measured at the locations of these SNR candidates are systematically lower by about 0.5 dex than those measured at the locations of core-collapse (CC) SNe, implying that their progenitors might be shorter lived and therefore more massive than a typical CCSN progenitor. The methods laid out in this work open a new window into the study of nearby SNe with integral field spectroscopy.

时间尺度为60天的强烈余辉映射活动显示，著名的紫外发射线对连续发射的波动有显著变化。在14个月的观测过程中，UV发射线的响应表现出不同的时间延迟，需要包括每条发射线的缓慢变化背景才能进行一维回声映射模型拟合。这些变化在C iv光线曲线中更为明显，这是Mrk 817中受固有吸收影响最小且不太与相邻发射线混合的光谱线。我们确定了五个具有明显发射线响应的时间窗口，并测量了它们对应的时间延迟，范围为2至13天。这些时间窗口可能与同一时间段内发生的UV和X射线遮挡的变化有关。最短的时间延迟出现在遮挡减弱的时期，而最长的延迟出现在遮挡增加的时期。我们认为遮挡出流屏蔽了广泛的UV线，免受电离的连续发射。由此产生的离子连续发射的光谱能量分布的变化，被远离核心的云所观察，这是造成线响应变化的原因。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究利用哈勃空间望远镜对Seyfert 1星系Mrk 817进行了密集的余辉映射活动，发现UV发射线对连续辐射的响应有显著变化，随着时间的推移呈现出不同的时间延迟。研究指出，这些时间延迟与UV和X射线遮挡的变化有关，最短的时间延迟出现在遮挡减弱的时期，而最长的延迟出现在遮挡增加的时期。此外，研究还提出了遮挡出流屏蔽了广泛的UV线的假设，并解释了因此导致的线响应变化。 <div>
An intensive reverberation mapping campaign of the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 817 using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope revealed significant variations in the response of broad UV emission lines to fluctuations in the continuum emission. The response of the prominent UV emission lines changes over an ∼60 day duration, resulting in distinctly different time lags in the various segments of the light curve over the 14 month observing campaign. One-dimensional echo-mapping models fit these variations if a slowly varying background is included for each emission line. These variations are more evident in the C iv light curve, which is the line least affected by intrinsic absorption in Mrk 817 and least blended with neighboring emission lines. We identify five temporal windows with a distinct emission-line response, and measure their corresponding time delays, which range from 2 to 13 days. These temporal windows are plausibly linked to changes in the UV and X-ray obscuration occurring during these same intervals. The shortest time lags occur during periods with diminishing obscuration, whereas the longest lags occur during periods with rising obscuration. We propose that the obscuring outflow shields the broad UV lines from the ionizing continuum. The resulting change in the spectral energy distribution of the ionizing continuum, as seen by clouds at a range of distances from the nucleus, is responsible for the changes in the line response.

<title>Silicate Extinction Profile Based on the Stellar Spectrum by Spitzer/IRS</title>

<div> Spitzer/IRS spectra, interstellar features, amorphous silicate dust, extinction profile, peak wavelength<br />
<br />总结:<br />本文利用"对比法"确定了硅酸盐消光谱线，发现9.7μm特征峰值波长约为9.2-9.8μm，而18μm特征峰值波长约为18-22μm。9.7μm特征峰值波长似乎随着恒星光谱类型的变化而变短，而全宽却与光谱类型似乎无关，这可能与星周硅酸盐发射有关。9.7μm硅酸盐吸收光学深度Δτ9.7随J-KS颜色过剩增加而增加。此外，9.7μm特征的峰值波长和全宽的相关系数为0.4，表明存在正相关关系。研究方法与用大气模型的光谱能量分布替换参考星进行了比较，结果显示没有显著差异。 <div>
The 9.7 and 18 μm interstellar spectral features, arising from the Si–O stretching and O–Si–O bending modes of amorphous silicate dust, are the strongest extinction features in the infrared. Here we use the “pair method” to determine the silicate extinction profile by comparing the Spitzer/IRS spectra of 49 target stars with obvious extinction with those of unreddened stars of the same spectral type. The 9.7 μm extinction profile is determined from all the 49 stars and the 18 μm profile is determined from six stars. It is found that the profile has a peak wavelength at ∼9.2–9.8 and ∼18–22 μm, respectively. The peak wavelength of the 9.7 μm feature seems to become shorter for stars of late spectral types; meanwhile the FWHM seems irrelevant to the spectral type, which may be related to circumstellar silicate emission. The silicate optical depth at 9.7 μm, Δτ9.7, mostly increases with the color excess in J − KS ( ). The mean ratio of the visual extinction to the 9.7 μm silicate absorption optical depth is AV/Δτ9.7 ≈ 17.8, in close agreement with that of the solar-neighborhood diffuse interstellar medium. When , this proportionality changes. The correlation coefficient between the peak wavelength and the FWHM of the 9.7 μm feature is 0.4, which indicates a positive correlation considering the uncertainties of the parameters. The method is compared with replacing the reference star by an atmospheric model spectral energy distribution and no significant difference is observed.

<div> SEP事件, 太阳能粒子, 磁场, EUV波, 飞行器

太阳能粒子加速的主要驱动因素被认为是由日冕质量抛射引起的冲击波。极紫外波被认为是太阳表面上冲击波的传播足迹。SEP研究中的一个关键问题是SEP释放的时间与EUV波与观测者磁性连接的时间之间的关系。利用帕克太阳探测器（PSP）和太阳轨道飞行器（SolO）对太阳附近的测量，我们调查了发生在2021年9月28日的一个SEP事件，SolO、PSP、STEREO-A和近地飞行器在不同位置观测到该事件。在此期间，SolO、PSP和STEREO-A相对于SEP源区有相似的标称磁场足点，但处于不同的太阳系距离。我们发现，在这四个地点估计的SEP释放时间相对于EUV波截获连接到每个飞行器的标称磁场足点的时间延迟约30-60分钟。结合无线电、白光和EUV的多波长观测和几何冲击模型，我们分析了此事件中的冲击特性，并讨论了SEP的加速和延迟释放过程，以及使用EUV波确定SEP加速和释放时间的准确性和局限性。 <br /><br />总结: SEP事件的驱动因素主要是由冠状质量抛射引起的冲击波，而极紫外波被认为是在太阳表面的冲击痕迹。文章对一个SEP事件的观测进行了研究和分析，发现SEP释放时间与EUV波截获连接到观测器的标称磁场足点的时间之间存在一定程度的延迟。通过多波长观测和几何冲击模型的分析，讨论了SEP的加速和延迟释放过程，以及使用EUV波确定SEP加速和释放时间的准确性和局限性。 <div>
The main driver of the acceleration of solar energetic particles (SEPs) is believed to be shocks driven by coronal mass ejections. Extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) waves are thought to be the propagating footprint of the shock on the solar surface. One of the key questions in SEP research is the timing of the SEP release with respect to the time when the EUV wave magnetically connects with an observer. Taking advantage of close-to-the-Sun measurements by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO), we investigate an SEP event that occurred on 2021 September 28 and was observed at different locations by SolO, PSP, STEREO-A, and near-Earth spacecraft. During this time, SolO, PSP, and STEREO-A shared similar nominal magnetic footpoints relative to the SEP source region but were at different heliocentric distances. We find that the SEP release times estimated at these four locations were delayed compared to the times when the EUV wave intercepted the footpoints of the nominal magnetic fields connecting to each spacecraft by around 30–60 minutes. Combining observations in multiple wavelengths of radio, white light, and EUV with a geometrical shock model, we analyze the associated shock properties and discuss the acceleration and delayed release processes of SEPs in this event as well as the accuracy and limitations of using EUV waves to determine the SEP acceleration and release times.

<title>Highly Coherent Quasiperiodic Oscillations in the “Heartbeat” Black Hole X-Ray Binary IGR J17091–3624</title>

<div> 黑洞X射线双星，IGR J17091–3624，2022年爆发时观测到异常一致的准周期振荡（QPO），表现为软态的典型BHXB特征，同时伴随着类似心跳的变化。QPO频率5-8赫兹，Q因子大于50，是BHXB中最高相干的低频QPO之一。这一发现提示具有“心跳”变化的BHXB可能具有独特的高相干和强大的QPO。总结：IGR J17091–3624是黑洞X射线双星，2022年观测到异常一致的准周期振荡（QPO），表现为软态的典型BHXB特征。该QPO频率5-8赫兹，Q因子大于50，是BHXB中最高相干的低频QPO之一。提示“心跳”变化的BHXB可能具有独特的高相干和强大的QPO。 <div>
IGR J17091–3624 is a black hole X-ray binary (BHXB), often referred to as the “twin” of GRS 1915+105 because it is the only other known BHXB that can show exotic “heartbeat”-like variability that is highly structured and repeated. Here, we report on observations of IGR J17091–3624 from its 2022 outburst, where we detect an unusually coherent quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) when the broadband variability is low (total fractional rms ≲6%) and the spectrum is dominated by the accretion disk. Such spectral and variability behavior is characteristic of the soft state of typical BHXBs (i.e., those that do not show heartbeats), but we also find that this QPO is strongest when there is some exotic heartbeat-like variability (so-called Class V variability). This QPO is detected at frequencies between 5 and 8 Hz and has Q factors (defined as the QPO frequency divided by the width) ≳50, making it one of the most highly coherent low-frequency QPOs ever seen in a BHXB. The extremely high Q factor makes this QPO distinct from typical low-frequency QPOs that are conventionally classified into type-A/B/C QPOs. Instead, we find evidence that archival observations of GRS 1915+105 also showed a similarly high-coherence QPO in the same frequency range, suggesting that this unusually coherent and strong QPO may be unique to BHXBs that can exhibit “heartbeat”-like variability.

We report observations of the ground state transitions of 12CO, 13CO, C18O, HCN, and HCO+ at 88–115 GHz in the inner region of the nearby galaxy IC 342. These data were obtained with the 16 pixel spectroscopic focal plane array Argus on the 100 m Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) at 6″–9″ resolution. In the nuclear bar region, the intensity distributions of 12CO(1–0) and 13CO(1–0) emission trace moderate densities, and differ from the dense gas distributions sampled in C18O(1–0), HCN(1–0), and HCO+(1–0). We observe a constant HCN(1–0)-to-HCO+(1–0) ratio of 1.2 ± 0.1 across the whole ∼1 kpc bar. This indicates that the HCN(1–0) and HCO+(1–0) lines have intermediate optical depth, and that the corresponding of the gas producing the emission is of order 104.5−6 cm−3. We show that HCO+(1–0) is thermalized and HCN(1–0) is close to thermalization. The very tight correlation between the HCN(1–0) and HCO+(1–0) intensities across the 1 kpc bar suggests that this ratio is more sensitive to the relative abundance of the two species than to the gas density. We confirm an angular offset (∼10″) between the spatial distribution of molecular gas and the star formation sites. Finally, we find a breakdown of the LIR– correlation at high spatial resolution due to the effect of incomplete sampling of star-forming regions by HCN emission in IC 342. The scatter of the LIR– relation decreases as the spatial scale increases from 10″ to 30″ (170–510 pc), and is comparable to the scatter of the global relation at a scale of 340 pc.

总结:
PSP和BepiColombo在0.34-0.37 au的距离收到了太阳耀粒子事件的影响，Curiosity火星车在约100°的位置观测到了有史以来最大的地面增强事件，Solar Orbiter和STEREO-A等航天器在0.7-1.0 au的中等距离处观测到了流交互区域，BepiColombo和PSP的数据显示了合理的一致性，最后介绍了关于这一耀粒子事件的各种持续努力。 <div>
On 2022 February 15–16, multiple spacecraft measured one of the most intense solar energetic particle (SEP) events observed so far in Solar Cycle 25. This study provides an overview of interesting observations made by multiple spacecraft during this event. Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and BepiColombo were close to each other at 0.34–0.37 au (a radial separation of ∼0.03 au) as they were impacted by the flank of the associated coronal mass ejection (CME). At about 100° in the retrograde direction and 1.5 au away from the Sun, the radiation detector on board the Curiosity surface rover observed the largest ground-level enhancement on Mars since surface measurements began. At intermediate distances (0.7–1.0 au), the presence of stream interaction regions (SIRs) during the SEP arrival time provides additional complexities regarding the analysis of the distinct contributions of CME-driven versus SIR-driven events in observations by spacecraft such as Solar Orbiter and STEREO-A, and by near-Earth spacecraft like ACE, SOHO, and WIND. The proximity of PSP and BepiColombo also enables us to directly compare their measurements and perform cross-calibration for the energetic particle instruments on board the two spacecraft. Our analysis indicates that energetic proton measurements from BepiColombo and PSP are in reasonable agreement with each other to within a factor of ∼1.35. Finally, this study introduces the various ongoing efforts that will collectively improve our understanding of this impactful, widespread SEP event.

ALMA观测了绿谷中的三个星系和两个星系的密度气体示踪物，研究发现，密度气体丰度对星系内的特定星形成率影响不大，星系内特定星形成率主要受SFEmol和SFEdense影响，而不是受密度气体的影响。与其他研究相比，绿谷样本显示出更低的全局SFEmol和更低的SFEdense，但在密度气体丰度方面与星形成和星暴星系相似。因此，绿谷星系中正常的分子气体含量受到抑制，主要是由于降低的SFEdense而不是密度气体的缺乏。<br /><br />总结：ALMA观测了绿谷中的三个星系和两个星系的密度气体示踪物，研究发现，密度气体丰度对星系内的特定星形成率影响不大，星系内特定星形成率主要受SFEmol和SFEdense影响，而不是受密度气体的影响。与其他研究相比，绿谷样本显示出更低的全局SFEmol和更低的SFEdense，但在密度气体丰度方面与星形成和星暴星系相似。因此，绿谷星系中正常的分子气体含量受到抑制，主要是由于降低的SFEdense而不是密度气体的缺乏。 <div>
We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of two dense gas tracers, HCN (1−0) and HCO+ (1-0) for three galaxies in the green valley and two galaxies on the star-forming main sequence with comparable molecular gas fractions as traced by the CO (1−0) emissions, selected from the ALMaQUEST survey. We investigate whether the deficit of molecular gas star formation efficiency (SFEmol) that leads to the low specific star formation rate (sSFR) in these green valley galaxies is due to a lack of dense gas (characterized by the dense gas fraction fdense) or the low star formation efficiency of dense gas (SFEdense). We find that SFEmol as traced by the CO emissions, when considering both star-forming and retired spaxels together, is tightly correlated with SFEdense and depends only weakly on fdense. The sSFR on kiloparsec scales is primarily driven by SFEmol and SFEdense, followed by the dependence on fmol, and is least correlated with fdense or the dense-gas-to-stellar mass ratio (Rdense). When compared with other works in the literature, we find that our green valley sample shows lower global SFEmol and lower SFEdense while exhibiting similar dense gas fractions when compared to star-forming and starburst galaxies. We conclude that the star formation of the three green valley galaxies with a normal abundance of molecular gas is suppressed, mainly due to the reduced SFEdense rather than the lack of dense gas.

<title>Long-term Evolution in Ionization of Ejecta Illuminated by Eta Carinae</title>

<div> 关键词: Eta Carinae, spectrum, evolution, circumstellar ejecta, ionization
总结: 
Eta Carinae (η Car)自1900年以来，其光度和光谱发生了变化，可能是由于中心双星系统的演化或周围射流物质的变化。在1940年代出现的亮度跳跃与窄禁闭发射线的出现可能是由于周围射流物质的清除和电离。之后的40年间，亮度变化缓慢。1990年代早期，被解释为中心双星向Weigelt clumps的光线通道中消散的限制线发射增加导致的。而到了2000年，中心恒星核心亮度增加迅速，但Homunculus没有明显变化。到2018年，从（η Car）到我们的LOS中的单电离金属发生了数百次窄线吸收的现象消失，这可能是由于金属的电离增加造成的。这三次事件的解释是Homunculus附近的周围射流物质的耗散。在过去的四十年中，Homunculus和主要的星风保持稳定，这表明我们方向上的周围射流物质已经被清除。 <div>
Changes in the flux and spectrum of Eta Carinae (η Car) since 1900 have been attributed to the evolution of the central binary by some. Others suggest evolution in the occulting ejecta. The brightness jump in the 1940s, which coincided with the appearance of narrow forbidden emission lines, may have been caused by the clearing and ionization of intervening circumstellar ejecta. The brightening changed at a slower pace up through 40 yr later. Here we continue earlier studies focused on the long-term, showing that the forbidden line emission increased in the early 1990s with no noticeable increase in the brightness of the Homunculus. We interpret that the increase in narrow-line emission is due to decreased extinction in the line of sight (LOS) from the central binary to the Weigelt clumps. In 2000, the central stellar core increased in brightness at a faster rate without associated changes in the Homunculus. By 2018, hundreds of narrow-line absorptions from singly ionized metals in our LOS from (η Car) disappeared, thought to be caused by increased ionization of metals. These three events (1990, 2000, and 2018) are explained by the dissipation of circumstellar material within the Homunculus close to the binary. Combining these changes with the steadiness of the Homunculus and the primary winds over the past four decades indicates that circumstellar ejecta in our direction have been cleared.

本文通过三维磁流体动力学模拟揭示了磁场对通过丝状物质碎裂形成的分子云核角动量演化的影响。研究发现，在弱和强磁场情况下，质量为1太阳质量的情况下，角动量分别减少了30%和50%。通过分析在流体元素上施加的扭矩，确定了在强磁场情况下，磁张力是质量尺度≲3太阳质量时角动量转移的主要过程。我们还发现，核的角动量的各向异性转移由于强磁场的存在只会改变核的角动量约2倍。研究还表明，旋转轴和磁场之间的角度分布在第一个核形成之前甚至没有明显的对齐。我们的结果还表明，核的角动量的多样性来源于初始湍流速度场的相位差异。这种多样性可能有助于最近观测到的原行星盘的尺寸和其他性质的多样性。 
<br /><br />总结: <br />磁场对分子云核角动量的影响进行了研究，发现在强磁场条件下，角动量减小约50%。同时分析了磁力对角动量转移的影响，指出磁张力是影响角动量转移的主要过程。研究结果还发现旋转轴和磁场之间的角度分布并不强烈对齐，并且核的角动量多样性来源于初始湍流速度场的相位差异。 <div>
The angular momentum of molecular cloud cores plays a key role in the star formation process. However, the evolution of the angular momentum of molecular cloud cores formed in magnetized molecular filaments is still unclear. In this paper, we perform 3D magnetohydrodynamics simulations to reveal the effect of the magnetic field on the evolution of the angular momentum of molecular cloud cores formed through filament fragmentation. As a result, we find that the angular momentum decreases by 30% and 50% at the mass scale of 1 M⊙ in the case of weak and strong magnetic field, respectively. By analyzing the torques exerted on fluid elements, we identify the magnetic tension as the dominant process for angular momentum transfer for mass scales ≲3 M⊙ for the strong magnetic field case. This critical mass scale can be understood semianalytically as the timescale of magnetic braking. We show that the anisotropy of the angular momentum transfer due to the presence of a strong magnetic field changes the resultant angular momentum of the core only by a factor of 2. We also find that the distribution of the angle between the rotation axis and the magnetic field does not show strong alignment even just before the first core formation. Our results also indicate that the variety of the angular momentum of the cores is inherited from the difference in the phase of the initial turbulent velocity field. The variety could contribute to the diversity in size and other properties of protoplanetary disks recently reported by observations.

<div> 太阳，CME， Solar Orbiter，BepiColombo， Parker Solar Probe
总结: 2022年2月15日，科学家观测到了一次令人印象深刻的太阳色球丝发射事件，该事件与一个快速的日冕物质抛射（CME）有关，其速度约为2200km/s。此CME指向BepiColombo和Parker Solar Probe，这两个探测器在CME驱动的冲击波到达时的纬度相差2°，经度相差4°，径向距离相差0.03天文单位。两个探测器测得的主要CME相关结构显示一些明显差异，增加了对整体CME结构的理解的挑战。需要通过距离较近的探测器星座来研究太阳瞬变现象。 <div>
On 2022 February 15, an impressive filament eruption was observed off the solar eastern limb from three remote-sensing viewpoints, namely, Earth, STEREO-A, and Solar Orbiter. In addition to representing the most-distant observed filament at extreme ultraviolet wavelengths—captured by Solar Orbiter's field of view extending to above 6 R⊙—this event was also associated with the release of a fast (∼2200 km s−1) coronal mass ejection (CME) that was directed toward BepiColombo and Parker Solar Probe. These two probes were separated by 2° in latitude, 4° in longitude, and 0.03 au in radial distance around the time of the CME-driven shock arrival in situ. The relative proximity of the two probes to each other and the Sun (∼0.35 au) allows us to study the mesoscale structure of CMEs at Mercury's orbit for the first time. We analyze similarities and differences in the main CME-related structures measured at the two locations, namely, the interplanetary shock, the sheath region, and the magnetic ejecta. We find that, despite the separation between the two spacecraft being well within the typical uncertainties associated with determination of CME geometric parameters from remote-sensing observations, the two sets of in situ measurements display some profound differences that make understanding the overall 3D CME structure particularly challenging. Finally, we discuss our findings within the context of space weather at Mercury's distance and in terms of the need to investigate solar transients via spacecraft constellations with small separations, which has been gaining significant attention during recent years.

More than 36 yr have passed since the discovery of the infrared excess from circumstellar dust orbiting the white dwarf G29-38, which at 17.5 pc it is the nearest and brightest of its class. The precise morphology of the orbiting dust remains only marginally constrained by existing data, subject to model-dependent inferences, and thus fundamental questions of its dynamical origin and evolution persist. This study presents a means to constrain the geometric distribution of the emitting dust using stellar pulsations measured at optical wavelengths as a variable illumination source of the dust, which reradiates primarily in the infrared. By combining optical photometry from the Whole Earth Telescope with 0.7–2.5 μm spectroscopy obtained with SpeX at NASA’s Infrared Telescope Facility, we detect luminosity variations at all observed wavelengths, with variations at most wavelengths corresponding to the behavior of the pulsating stellar photosphere, but toward the longest wavelengths the light curves probe the corresponding time variability of the circumstellar dust. In addition to developing methodology, we find the pulsation amplitudes decrease with increasing wavelength for principal pulsation modes, yet increase beyond ≈2 μm for nonlinear combination frequencies. We interpret these results as combination modes derived from the principal modes of identical ℓ values and discuss the implications for the morphology of the warm dust. We also draw attention to some discrepancies between our findings and theoretical expectations for the results of the nonlinearity imposed by the surface convection zone on mode–mode interactions and on the behavior of the first harmonic of the highest-amplitude pulsation mode.

The radiation mechanism (thermal photosphere or magnetic synchrotron) and the progenitor of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are under hot debate. Recently discovered, the prompt long-duration (∼10 s, normally from the collapse of massive stars) property of GRB 211211A strongly conflicts with its association with a kilonova (normally from the merger of two compact objects, NS–NS, NS–BH, or NS–WD, duration ≲2 s). In this paper, we find that the probability photosphere model with a structured jet can satisfactorily explain this peculiar long duration, through the duration stretching effect (∼3 times) on the intrinsic longer (∼3 s) duration of an NS–BH merger, the observed empirical 2SBPL spectrum (with soft low-energy index α of ∼−1), and its evolution. In addition, much evidence of the NS–BH merger origin is found, especially the good fit of the afterglow-subtracted optical−near-IR light curves by the significant thermal cocoon emission and the sole thermal “red” kilonova component. Finally, a convincing new explanation for the X-ray afterglow plateau is revealed.

AMS-02 on board the International Space Station provides precise measurements of cosmic rays (CR) near Earth, while Voyager measures CRs in the local interstellar medium, beyond the effects of solar modulation. Based on these data, we test and revise various CR propagation scenarios under standard assumptions: pure diffusion, diffusion with convection, diffusion with reacceleration, and diffusion with reacceleration and convection. We report on the scenarios’ performance against CR measurements, aiming to limit the number of model parameters as much as possible. For each scenario, we find parameters that are able to reproduce Voyager and AMS-02 data for the entire energy band for all the CR species tested. Above several GV, we observe a similar injection spectral index for He and C, with He harder than H. Some scenarios previously disfavored are now reconsidered. For example, contrary to usual assumptions, we find that the pure diffusion scenario does not need an upturn in the diffusion coefficient at low energy, while it needs the same number of low-energy breaks in the injection spectrum as diffusive-reacceleration scenarios. We show that scenarios differ in modeled spectra of one order of magnitude for positrons at ∼1 GeV and of a factor of 2 for antiprotons at several GV. The force-field approximation describes well the AMS-02 and Voyager spectra analyzed, except antiprotons. We confirm the ∼10 GeV excess in the antiproton spectrum for all scenarios. Also, for all scenarios, the resulting modulation should be stronger for positrons than for nuclei, with reacceleration models requiring much larger modulation.

<br />双中子星融合现在被认为是大量产生重元素的过程，但是否是唯一或主要的快速中子俘获核生成过程的地点尚不清楚。双中子星的发生率、延迟时间和银河环境将影响它们对太阳系和银河中元素丰度的总贡献。另外，双中子星融合的预期元素产量可能取决于融合参数本身，例如它们的恒星质量和半径，这在许多银河化学演化模型中尚未考虑。通过观察 Milky Way 中的双中子星系统样本的特征，我们预测了双中子星群体在融合时产生的预期核合成产物，并将其核合成特征与太阳系元素的重元素丰度模式进行了比较。我们发现，根据当前的模型，目前的双中子星群体更有利于产生较轻的 r-过程元素，而相对于太阳系来说产生了较轻的元素。这种不一致可能意味着存在额外的重元素产生地点或者一个与目前观察到的双中子星群体相差很大的群体。 <br /><br />总结:双中子星融合是重元素产生的重要过程，但它们对于重元素丰度的贡献可能被低估。当前的模型显示，双中子星更有可能产生轻型 r-过程元素，而相对于太阳系来说产生了较少的重元素。这可能意味着存在其他产生重元素的地点或者目前观察到的双中子星群体有所不同。 <div>
While it is now known that the mergers of double neutron star binary systems (NSMs) are copious producers of heavy elements, there remains much speculation about whether they are the sole or even principal site of rapid neutron-capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis, one of the primary ways in which heavy elements are produced. The occurrence rates, delay times, and galactic environments of NSMs hold sway over estimating their total contribution to the elemental abundances in the solar system and the Galaxy. Furthermore, the expected elemental yields of NSMs may depend on the merger parameters themselves—such as their stellar masses and radii—which are not currently considered in many galactic chemical evolution models. Using the characteristics of the observed sample of double neutron star (DNS) systems in the Milky Way as a guide, we predict the expected nucleosynthetic yields that a population of DNSs would produce upon merger, and we compare that nucleosynthetic signature to the heavy-element abundance pattern of solar system elements. We find that with our current models, the present DNS population favors the production of lighter r-process elements, while underproducing the heaviest elements relative to the solar system. This inconsistency could imply an additional site for the heaviest elements or a population of DNSs much different from that observed today.

总结: 
DESI早期数据释放，使用SV3数据对z=0.1到0.3的HOD进行建模，其中包括CiC测量。使用galtab软件包对HOD模型进行快速精确的CiC预测，加速并提高了HOD参数的约束。通过HOD拟合，对特征暗物质质量和组装偏差进行了约束，并提供了各个阈值样本的特征暗物质质量、组装偏差等参数的数据。未来DESI数据预计会进一步缩小这些约束范围，因为数据范围将是SV3的100倍。 <div>
We explore the galaxy-halo connection information that is available in low-redshift samples from the early data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We model the halo occupation distribution (HOD) from z = 0.1 to 0.3 using Survey Validation 3 (SV3; a.k.a., the One-Percent Survey) data of the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey. In addition to more commonly used metrics, we incorporate counts-in-cylinders (CiC) measurements, which drastically tighten HOD constraints. Our analysis is aided by the Python package, galtab, which enables the rapid, precise prediction of CiC for any HOD model available in halotools. This methodology allows our Markov chains to converge with much fewer trial points, and enables even more drastic speedups due to its GPU portability. Our HOD fits constrain characteristic halo masses tightly and provide statistical evidence for assembly bias, especially at lower luminosity thresholds: the HOD of central galaxies in z ∼ 0.15 samples with limiting absolute magnitude Mr < −20.0 and Mr < −20.5 samples is positively correlated with halo concentration with a significance of 99.9% and 99.5%, respectively. Our models also favor positive central assembly bias for the brighter Mr < −21.0 sample at z ∼ 0.25 (94.8% significance), but there is no significant evidence for assembly bias with the same luminosity threshold at z ∼ 0.15. We provide our constraints for each threshold sample’s characteristic halo masses, assembly bias, and other HOD parameters. These constraints are expected to be significantly tightened with future DESI data, which will span an area 100 times larger than that of SV3.

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been proposed as one of the promising sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), but observational evidence is still lacking. The nearby brightest of all time GRB 221009A, a once in 1000 yr event, is able to accelerate protons to ∼103 EeV, and then generate extremly energetic neutrons via the photomeson production interaction. Protons arriving at the Milky Way are dominated by neutron-decay-induced protons. The intergalactic magnetic fields would not yield a sizable delay of the ≥10 EeV cosmic rays if its strength is ≲10−13 G, while Galactic magnetic fields would cause a significant time delay. We predict that a UHECR burst from GRB 221009A would be detectable by the Pierre Auger Observatory and the TA×4, within ∼10 yr. The detection of such a UHECR outburst will provide the direct evidence for UHECR acceleration in GRBs.

<div> 关键词: 超新星、恒星演化、密集星周介质、双星、CSM
总结:
超新星观测表明部分大质量恒星在核心崩塌时存在密集的星周介质。本研究使用MESA进行大质量恒星的双星演化模拟，并通过PLUTO进行流体动力学模拟，探讨了双星演化对星周介质形成的影响。研究发现，在双星系统中，质量传递率可能在Roche波效应开始时增加，与爆炸前CSM的结构有关。此外，不同轨道周期的双星系统会形成不同密度结构的CSM，包括壳状和悬崖状结构。这些特征结构的长度尺度约为10^17厘米，若CSM速度较慢（约10 km/s），长期超新星观测可能揭示这些结构。研究结果强调了双星相互作用在再现CSM结构多样性方面的重要性。 <div>
Recent observations of supernovae (SNe) have indicated that a fraction of massive stars possess dense circumstellar medium (CSM) at the moment of their core collapses. They suggest the presence of additional activities of the SN progenitor driving the enhancement of the mass-loss rate, and some physical processes attributing to a single star’s activities have been considered. In this study, we carry out binary evolutionary simulations of massive stars by MESA and investigate effects on the subsequent CSM formation through hydrodynamical simulations by PLUTO. We show that the mass transfer rate in a binary can increase at the beginning of the Roche lobe overflow, and this enhancement would be associated with the structure of the CSM before the explosion. We also illustrate that, depending on the orbital period of the binary, the density structure of the CSM can have a diverse distribution, including shell-like and cliff-like structures. These characteristic structures appear within the length scale of ∼1017 cm and could be traced by long-term observations of SNe, if the slow velocity of the CSM is assumed (∼10 km s−1). Our results highlight the importance of binary interaction in the aspect of reproducing the diversity of the CSM configuration.

<div> 线偏振，Orion Molecular Cloud 3，ALMA观测，尘埃盘，CO流

线偏振ALMA观测显示了Orion Molecular Cloud 3区域内七个恒星形成源的尘埃盘状结构和CO流的特征。尘埃盘的直径从16到97天文单位不等，其中一些源的极化强度占据了整个Stokes I峰值的10%至20%。其中一些源的极化方向与尘埃盘的短轴对齐，而一些源的极化强度出现了向盘的近侧移动，支持了极化辐射源于自相散射的观点。文章还对极化辐射的来源进行了讨论，包括自相散射和磁场对尘埃排列的影响。 <div>
We present the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of linearly polarized 1.1 mm continuum emission at ∼0.″14 (55 au) resolution and CO (J = 2−1) emission at ∼1.″5 (590 au) resolution toward one prestellar (MMS 4), four Class 0 (MMS 1, MMS 3, MMS 5, and MMS 6), one Class I (MMS 7), and one flat-spectrum (MMS 2) sources in the Orion Molecular Cloud 3 region. The dust disk-like structures and clear CO outflows are detected toward all sources except for MMS 4. The diameters of these disk-like structures, ranging from 16 to 97 au, are estimated based on the deconvolved full width half maximum (FWHM) values obtained from the multi-Gaussian fitting. Polarized emissions are detected toward MMS 2, MMS 5, MMS 6, and MMS 7, while no polarized emission is detected toward MMS 1, MMS 3, and MMS 4. MMS 2, MMS 5, and MMS 7 show organized polarization vectors aligned with the minor axes of the disk-like structures, with mean polarization fractions ranging from 0.6% to 1.2%. The strongest millimeter source, MMS 6, exhibits complex polarization orientations and a remarkably high polarization fraction of ∼10% around the Stokes I peak, and 15%–20% on the arm-like structure, as reported by Takahashi et al. (2019). The origins of the polarized emission, such as self-scattering and dust alignment due to the magnetic field or radiative torque, are discussed for individual sources. Some disk-like sources exhibit a polarized intensity peak shift toward the nearside of the disk, which supports that the polarized emission originates from self-scattering.

总结:<br />
Henize 2–10 是一个矮星爆发星系，其中含有一个大约10^6太阳质量的黑洞，它正在驱动电离流，并在星系中心的约100光年范围内触发星形成。研究使用ALMA进行了射电和分子谱线观测，发现黑洞的谱能量分布在1.4至340 GHz范围内由同步辐射主导。分析了分子气体数据，并确定了黑洞周围的分子气体结构，其物理尺度约为130光年×30光年，分子气体质量约为10^6太阳质量。值得注意的是，黑洞的位置与分子气体的峰值强度有显著偏移，这可能解释了为什么黑洞的Eddington比例非常低。对CO J = 3–2和J = 1–0的空间分辨率线比的分析表明，黑洞附近的CO气体受到了极高的激发，特别是在黑洞喷流和触发星形成区域的交界处。这暗示着冷的分子气体受到了黑洞的双极喷流的冲击，支持了积极的黑洞反馈的观点。 <div>
Henize 2–10 is a dwarf starburst galaxy hosting a ∼106M⊙ black hole (BH) that is driving an ionized outflow and triggering star formation within the central ∼100 pc of the galaxy. Here, we present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array continuum observations from 99 to 340 GHz, as well as spectral line observations of the molecules CO (1–0, 3–2), HCN (1–0, 3–2), and HCO+ (1–0, 3–2), with a focus on the BH and its vicinity. Incorporating centimeter-wave radio measurements from the literature, we show that the spectral energy distribution of the BH is dominated by synchrotron emission from 1.4 to 340 GHz, with a spectral index of α ≈ − 0.5. We analyze the spectral line data and identify an elongated molecular gas structure around the BH with a velocity distinct from the surrounding regions. The physical extent of this molecular gas structure is ≈130 pc × 30 pc and the molecular gas mass is ∼106M⊙. Despite an abundance of molecular gas in this general region, the position of the BH is significantly offset from the peak intensity, which may explain why the BH is radiating at a very low Eddington ratio. Our analysis of the spatially resolved line ratio between CO J = 3–2 and J = 1–0 implies that the CO gas in the vicinity of the BH is highly excited, particularly at the interface between the BH outflow and the regions of triggered star formation. This suggests that the cold molecular gas is being shocked by the bipolar outflow from the BH, supporting the case for positive BH feedback.

Rotational periods derived from autocorrelation function (ACF) techniques on stars photometrically similar to the Sun in Kepler data have proven difficult to reliably determine. We investigate various instrumental and astrophysical factors affecting the accuracy of these measurements, including the effects of observational windows and noise, stellar activity and inclination, spectral passbands, and the separate normalization of contiguous segments. We validate that the flux variations due to faculae are very periodic, but starspots are the dominant source of bolometric and visible differential variability in Sun-like stars on rotational timescales. We quantify how much stronger the relative contribution of faculae would have to be to render Sun-like light curves periodic enough to reliably measure with autocorrelation methods. We also quantify how long starspot lifetimes need to be to render pure spot light curves periodic enough. In general, longer observational windows yield more accurate ACF measurements, even when faculae are not present. Due to the enhancement of the relative contribution of faculae, observing stars with intermediate inclinations, during activity minima, and/or through bluer passbands has the effect of strengthening the periodicity of the light curve. We search for other manifestations of faculae in broadband photometry of Sun-like stars and conclude that without absolute flux measurements or restriction to shorter-wavelength passbands, differential light curves are uninformative about faculae.

Galactic compact binaries with orbital periods shorter than a few hours emit detectable gravitational waves (GWs) at low frequencies. Their GW signals can be detected with the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Crucially, they may be useful in the early months of the mission operation in helping to validate LISA's performance in comparison to prelaunch expectations. We present an updated list of 55 candidate LISA-detectable binaries with measured properties, for which we derive distances based on Gaia Data Release 3 astrometry. Based on the known properties from electromagnetic observations, we predict the LISA detectability after 1, 3, 6, and 48 months using Bayesian analysis methods. We distinguish between verification and detectable binaries as being detectable after 3 and 48 months, respectively. We find 18 verification binaries and 22 detectable sources, which triples the number of known LISA binaries over the last few years. These include detached double white dwarfs, AM CVn binaries, one ultracompact X-ray binary, and two hot subdwarf binaries. We find that across this sample the GW amplitude is expected to be measured to ≈10% on average, while the inclination is expected to be determined with ≈15° precision. For detectable binaries, these average errors increase to ≈50% and ≈40°, respectively.

<div> radio supernovae, inhomogeneities, deduced source properties, volume filling factor, synchrotron emission

总结:<br /><br />本文讨论了空间未解析源中不均匀性的存在，这使得很难确定源的性质。文章展示了如何利用不符合均匀模型的观察特征来推断射电超新星中不均匀性的性质。此外，放射冷却的观察结果可能会受到不均匀性的严重影响。文章指出，观测到的冷却频率的值对推断源的性质非常敏感；即使是下限通常也有助于限制其特征。文章认为SN 2003L中的主要同步辐射发射区具有较小的体积填充因子，可能低至几个百分点。相反，SN 2002ap中的非均匀性偏差显著较小。总体上，类型Ib/c射电超新星的观测性质表明个体源的体积填充因子随时间保持相当恒定，但在射电频率上达到峰值的源具有较低的填充因子。SN 2003L和SN 2002ap中主同步辐射组分的条件与相对论电子和磁场之间的能量均衡一致。 <div>
The presence of inhomogeneities in a spatially unresolved source is often hard to establish. This limits the accuracy with which the source properties can be determined. It is shown how observed features not expected for a homogeneous model can be used to infer the properties of the inhomogeneities in radio supernovae. Furthermore, the observed consequences of radiative cooling can be seriously affected by inhomogeneities. It is shown that the deduced source properties are very sensitive to the observed value of the cooling frequency; even a lower limit is often useful to constrain its characteristics. It is argued that the main synchrotron emission region in SN 2003L has a small volume filling factor, possibly as low as a few percent. On the contrary, deviations from homogeneity are substantially smaller in SN 2002ap. The observed properties of Type Ib/c radio supernovae in general indicate the volume filling factor to remain rather constant with time for individual sources, but those peaking later at radio frequencies have lower filling factors. The conditions in the main synchrotron component in both SN 2003L and SN 2002ap are consistent with equipartition of energy between relativistic electrons and magnetic fields.

GWSkyNet-Multi是一个用于对LIGO和Virgo观测所检测到的候选引力波事件进行分类的机器学习模型。该模型利用低延迟的公开警报中发布的有限信息，生成预测分数，指示事件是否是两个黑洞的合并、涉及中子星的合并，或者是非天体故障。然而，人们对于模型如何利用有限的信息进行预测并不了解。通过对模型和其输入进行系统性干扰，我们发现模型学习用于区分源的基本特征和相关性。我们发现，二维天空图的定位区域和计算的一致性与不一致性贝叶斯因子被用作强有力的预测器，用于区分真实事件和故障。而估计的源距离进一步用于区分二进制黑洞合并和涉及中子星的合并。我们利用这些发现来展示GWSkyNet-Multi在LVK的第三次观测运行中错误分类的事件具有不同的天空区域、一致性因子和距离值，这些影响了预测并解释了这些误分类。这些结果有助于识别模型的局限性，并为进一步优化提供了潜在的途径。 <br /><br />总结: GWSkyNet-Multi是一个用于分类引力波事件的深度学习模型，借助有限信息进行预测，发现了特定的天空区域、一致性因子和距离值对于区分不同类型的事件具有重要作用，同时揭示了模型的局限性并提出了进一步优化的可能路径。 <div>
GWSkyNet-Multi is a machine learning model developed for the classification of candidate gravitational-wave events detected by the LIGO and Virgo observatories. The model uses limited information released in the low-latency Open Public Alerts to produce prediction scores indicating whether an event is a merger of two black holes (BHs), a merger involving a neutron star (NS), or a non-astrophysical glitch. This facilitates time-sensitive decisions about whether to perform electromagnetic follow-up of candidate events during LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observing runs. However, it is not well understood how the model is leveraging the limited information available to make its predictions. As a deep learning neural network, the inner workings of the model can be difficult to interpret, impacting our trust in its validity and robustness. We tackle this issue by systematically perturbing the model and its inputs to explain what underlying features and correlations it has learned for distinguishing the sources. We show that the localization area of the 2D sky maps and the computed coherence versus incoherence Bayes factors are used as strong predictors for distinguishing between real events and glitches. The estimated distance to the source is further used to discriminate between binary BH mergers and mergers involving NSs. We leverage these findings to show that events misclassified by GWSkyNet-Multi in LVK’s third observing run have distinct sky areas, coherence factors, and distance values that influence the predictions and explain these misclassifications. The results help identify the model’s limitations and inform potential avenues for further optimization.

We study the stellar population properties of 182 spectroscopically confirmed (MUSE/VLT) Lyα emitters (LAEs) and 450 photometrically selected Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at z = 2.8–6.7 in the Hubble Extreme Deep Field. Leveraging the combined power of Hubble Space Telescope and JWST NIRCam and MIRI observations, we analyze their rest-frame UV-through-near-IR spectral energy distributions, with MIRI playing a crucial role in robustly assessing the LAEs’ stellar masses and ages. Our LAEs are low-mass objects with little or no dust extinction (E(B − V) ≃ 0.1) and a blue UV continuum slope (β ≃ −2.2). While 75% of our LAEs are young (<100 Myr), the remaining 25% have significantly older stellar populations (≥100 Myr). These old LAEs are statistically more massive, less extinct, and have lower specific star formation rate than young LAEs. Besides, they populate the plane of M⋆ versus star formation rate along the main sequence of star-forming galaxies, while young LAEs populate the starburst region. The comparison between the LAEs’ properties and those of a stellar-mass-matched sample of LBGs shows no statistical difference between these objects, except for the LBGs’ redder UV continuum slope and marginally larger E(B − V) values. Interestingly, 48% of the LBGs have ages <10 Myr and are classified as starbursts, but lack detectable Lyα emission. This is likely due to H i resonant scattering and/or dust-selective extinction. Overall, we find that JWST observations are crucial in determining the properties of LAEs and shedding light on their comparison with LBGs.

Directly observing exoplanets with coronagraphs is impeded by the presence of speckles from aberrations in the optical path, which can be mitigated in hardware with wave front control, as well as in post-processing. This work explores using an instrument model in post-processing to separate astrophysical signals from residual aberrations in coronagraphic data. The effect of wave front error (WFE) on the coronagraphic intensity consists of a linear contribution and a quadratic contribution. When either of the terms is much larger than the other, the instrument response can be approximated by a transfer matrix mapping WFE to detector plane intensity. From this transfer matrix, a useful projection onto instrumental modes that removes the dominant error modes can be derived. We apply this approach to synthetically generated Roman Space Telescope hybrid Lyot coronagraph data to extract “robust observables,” which can be used instead of raw data for applications such as detection testing. The projection improves planet flux ratio detection limits by about 28% in the linear regime and by over a factor of 2 in the quadratic regime, illustrating that robust observables can increase sensitivity to astrophysical signals and improve the scientific yield from coronagraphic data. While this approach does not require additional information such as observations of reference stars or modulations of a deformable mirror, it can and should be combined with these other techniques, acting as a model-informed prior in an overall post-processing strategy.

The stellar stream connected to the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy is the most massive tidal stream that has been mapped in the Galaxy, and is the dominant contributor to the outer stellar halo of the Milky Way (MW). We present metallicity maps of the Sgr stream, using 34,240 red giant branch stars with inferred metallicities from Gaia BP/RP spectra. This sample is larger than previous samples of Sgr stream members with chemical abundances by an order of magnitude. We measure metallicity gradients with respect to Sgr stream coordinates (Λ, B), and highlight the gradient in metallicity with respect to stream latitude coordinate B, which has not been observed before. Including the core, we find ∇[M/H] = −2.48 ± 0.08 × 10−2 dex deg−1 above the stream track (B > B0, where B0 = 1.5° is the latitude of the Sgr remnant) and ∇[M/H] = −2.02 ± 0.08 × 10−2 dex deg−1 below the stream track (B < B0). By painting metallicity gradients onto a tailored N-body simulation of the Sgr stream, we find that the observed metallicities in the stream are consistent with an initial radial metallicity gradient in the Sgr dwarf galaxy of ∼−0.1 to −0.2 dex kpc−1, well within the range of observed metallicity gradients in Local Group dwarf galaxies. Our results provide novel observational constraints for the internal structure of the dwarf galaxy progenitor of the Sgr stream. Leveraging new large data sets in conjunction with tailored simulations, we can connect the present-day properties of disrupted dwarfs in the MW to their initial conditions.

总结: 本研究利用James Webb太空望远镜的MRS仪器对大麦哲伦星云（LMC）N79区域的11个年轻恒星对象（YSOs）进行了光谱观测。在N79区域的三个巨大分子云中，我们发现了具有特殊特征的YSOs，包括完整或几乎完整的4.9–27.9μm波段的发射和吸收线，其中年轻最小的YSO Y3显示出明显的冰吸收特征，并且其中心离子化YSO Y4具有大量的发射线。此外，我们还首次在中红外观测到了在星团中形成的高质量原恒星，而这些星团位于LMC这样的外星系环境中。根据H i (7-6)线的光度，我们得出四个YSOs的质量吸积率在1.22 × 10−4–1.89 × 10−2M⊙ yr−1之间。这项研究有助于我们更深入地了解外星系中的星际物质的形成和演化过程。<br /><br /> <div>
In this work, we present spectra of 11 young stellar objects (YSOs) taken with the Mid-Infrared Instrument / Medium Resolution Spectroscopy (MRS) instrument on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The YSOs are located in the N79 region of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), an active star-forming region with hundreds of Spitzer- and Herschel-identified YSOs and host to super star cluster (SSC) candidate H72.97-69.39. The three giant molecular clouds in N79 (East, West, and South) have varying star formation rates and stellar populations. MRS follow-up observations of four Spitzer-identified YSOs in N79 East, West, and South have revealed that what seemed to be a single, massive YSO is actually a cluster of YSOs. We discuss the emission and absorption lines of six YSOs that have complete or almost-complete spectral coverage from 4.9–27.9 μm. YSO Y3, located in N79 East, is the youngest source in this study and likely to be less than 10,000 yr old, as inferred from the prominent CH4, NH3, CH3OH, CH3OCHO, and CO2 ice absorption features. The most luminous source is the central ionizing YSO of SSC H72.97-69.39, Y4, which has dozens of fine-structure and H2 emission lines. Unlike the other YSOs in this work, Y4 has no polyaromatic hydrocarbon emission lines, due to the intense ionizing radiation destroying these large carbon-chain molecules. The mass accretion rates based on the H i (7-6) line luminosities of YSOs Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y9 range between 1.22 × 10−4–1.89 × 10−2M⊙ yr−1. For the first time in the mid-infrared, we are able to resolve individual high-mass protostars forming in small clusters in an extragalactic environment like the LMC.

<div> AGNs, Lockman Hole field, spectroscopic sample, [Ne v]λ3426 emission line, MIR SEDs  
总结: 该研究使用24μm选取的光谱样本，在Lockman Hole区域发现了4035个光谱。研究旨在识别活动星系核（AGNs）并确定在这个中红外选择样本中的占比。通过用[Ne v]λ3426发射线进行光谱识别，发现样本中有887个（约22%）AGNs。通过堆叠分析发现在MIR楔形选取的AGN候选者中，堆叠光谱仍然显示出明显的[Ne v]λ3426发射信号。而在楔形之外的非AGN候选者中则没有清晰的[Ne v]λ3426信号。研究开发了一种方法，利用静止系L12/L1.6对L4.5/L1.6图表，将AGN和星形成对MIR SEDs的贡献分离出来。他们发现AGN在12μm处的纯净光度与星形成率呈正相关，表明AGNs和宿主星系可能存在共同的气体供应，说明了观测到的相关性来自于不同红移范围内的种群特性的变化。 <div>
We present a 24 μm-selected spectroscopic sample z > 0.13 (median 〈z〉 = 0.41) in the Lockman Hole field, consisting of 4035 spectra. Our aim is to identify active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and determine their fraction in this mid-infrared-selected sample. In this work, we use the [Ne v]λ3426 emission line to spectroscopically identify AGNs. Combined with broad-line Type I AGNs selected in our previous study, our sample consists of 887 (∼22%) spectroscopically confirmed AGNs. We perform a stacking analysis on the remaining spectra and find that in various mid-infrared (MIR) wedge-selected AGN candidates, the stacked spectra still show significant [Ne v]λ3426 emission. In contrast, no clear [Ne v]λ3426 signal is detected in non-AGN candidates falling outside the wedges. Assuming a range of AGN MIR spectral energy distribution (SED) slope of −0.3 <α < 0.7, and an average star-forming relation derived from 65 star-forming templates, we develop a robust method to separate the AGN and star-forming contributions to the MIR SEDs using the rest-frame L12/L1.6 versus L4.5/L1.6 diagram. We separate the objects into bins of L12 and find that the AGN fraction increases with increasing L12. We also find that the stacked [Ne v]λ3426 strength scales with L12. The pure AGN luminosity at 12 μm exhibits a positive correlation with the star formation rates, indicating possible coevolution and common gas supply between the AGNs and their host galaxies. Varying population properties across the redshift range explored contribute to the observed correlation.

MOHEGs是Faranoff–Riley I/II类型的射电星系，富含分子氢，但星形成活动较低。通过H i 21 cm吸收线，对红移<0.2的中性氢气相关的射电MOHEGs进行研究，发现70%的星系中存在中性氢，距离相邻星系8-120 kpc。这些星系相比相似红移的合并星系，H i气体稀缺。发现N(H i)、NH与星系属性之间关联不强，表明原子气体对星形成可能不重要。总氢气面密度与星形成面密度的关系偏离标准的Kennicutt-Schmidt定律。研究强调了H i研究的重要性，并为解释这些星系的特性提供了见解。未来，使用下一代射电望远镜进行的H i 21 cm吸收线调查，比如Square Kilometre Array和先导仪器，可能会为这些关联提供更好的约束。
<br />总结: 本研究基于H i 21 cm吸收线对射电MOHEGs进行了中性氢气相关性的研究，发现了一些重要发现，包括70%的星系存在中性氢，这些星系中的H i气体稀缺，N(H i)、NH与星系属性之间关联不强，以及总氢气面密度与星形成面密度的关系与Kennicutt-Schmidt定律不符。这些发现强调了H i研究的重要性，并具有重要的见解。未来，使用下一代射电望远镜进行的H i 21 cm吸收线调查可能会为这些关联提供更好的约束。 <div>
Empirical studies of cold gas content are essential for comprehending the star formation activities and evolution in galaxies. However, it is not straightforward to understand these processes because they depend on various physical properties of the interstellar medium. Massive Faranoff–Riley I/II type radio galaxies rich in molecular hydrogen with lower star formation activities are known as radio molecular hydrogen emission galaxies (MOHEGs). We present a study of neutral hydrogen-gas-associated radio MOHEGs at redshifts <0.2 probed via the H i 21 cm absorption line. Neutral hydrogen is detected in 70% of these galaxies, which are located at a distance of 8–120 kpc from the neighboring galaxies. These galaxies show a scarcity of H i gas as compared to merging galaxies at similar redshifts. We found no strong correlation between N(H i), NH, and the galaxy properties, regardless of whether the H i is assumed to be cold or warm, indicating that the atomic gas probably plays no important role in star formation. The relation between the total hydrogen gas surface density and the star formation surface density deviates from the standard Kennicutt–Schmidt law. Our study highlights the importance of H i studies and offers insights into the role of atomic and molecular hydrogen gas in explaining the properties of these galaxies. In the upcoming H i 21 cm absorption surveys with next-generation radio telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array and pathfinder instruments, it may be possible to provide better constraints for these correlations.

<div> 关键词: CMB polarization, Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS), 40 GHz channel, synchrotron radiation, Atacama Desert

总结:<br /><br />
本文介绍了利用40 GHz通道的CLASS观测的CMB极化角尺度（ℓ < 30）特征的测量方法，并探讨了对再电离的光学深度的限制以及搜索通观宇宙膨胀的标志的重要性。通过对Atacama沙漠的优越条件和前端极化调制技术的稳定性，研究表明该通道的灵敏度高于卫星测量的类似频率。通过对漫射辐射的EE和BB谱的测量，对银河遮蔽的漫射辐射的漫射谱能量密度进行了空间方面的扩展。此外，还对ℓ < 125范围内的圆极化背景进行了上限测量，并给出了令人兴奋的可能性。这些结果为从地面恢复最大尺度的CMB极化建立了一种新标准，并展示了当包括更高灵敏度和更高频率的CLASS通道进行分析时的潜在机会。 <div>
Measurement of the largest angular scale (ℓ < 30) features of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization is a powerful way to constrain the optical depth to reionization and search for the signature of inflation through the detection of primordial B-modes. We present an analysis of maps covering 73.6% of the sky made from the 40 GHz channel of the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) from 2016 August to 2022 May. Taking advantage of the measurement stability enabled by front-end polarization modulation and excellent conditions from the Atacama Desert, we show this channel achieves higher sensitivity than the analogous frequencies from satellite measurements in the range 10 < ℓ < 100. Simulations show the CLASS linear (circular) polarization maps have a white noise level of . We measure the Galaxy-masked EE and BB spectra of diffuse synchrotron radiation and compare to space-based measurements at similar frequencies. In combination with external data, we expand measurements of the spatial variations of the synchrotron spectral energy density (SED) to include new sky regions and measure the diffuse SED in the harmonic domain. We place a new upper limit on a background of circular polarization in the range 5 < ℓ < 125 with the first bin showing Dℓ < 0.023 at 95% confidence. These results establish a new standard for recovery of the largest-scale CMB polarization from the ground and signal exciting possibilities when the higher sensitivity and higher-frequency CLASS channels are included in the analysis.

<title>Powerful Radio-loud Quasars Are Triggered by Galaxy Mergers in the Cosmic Bright Ages</title>

<div> AGN, radio-loud quasars, major galaxy mergers, black hole mass, Hubble Space Telescope
总结:
本研究测试了宇宙正午时期（1≲z≲2）强劲射电喷流AGN活动在大型星系合并中触发的假设。通过比较Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/IR观测到的z>1 3CR射电喧闹宽线类星体与三个配对的射电安静类星体对照样本，发现几乎所有的射电喧闹AGN都存在大型合并活动，而射电安静AGN中合并比例要低得多。这些结果表明大型星系合并是发射强大射电喷流的关键因素。另外，发现黑洞质量与宿主星系亮度之间存在紧密关联，与当地椭圆星系观察到的情况不一致。最后，指出很多射电喧闹类星体为蓝色，这一结果可能挑战了以星系合并为初始触发，红色类星体反馈后最终进入平静状态的"吹出"宇宙演化模型。 <div>
While supermassive black holes are ubiquitous features of galactic nuclei, only a small minority are observed during episodes of luminous accretion. The physical mechanism(s) driving the onset of fueling and ignition in these active galactic nuclei (AGN) are still largely unknown for many galaxies and AGN-selection criteria. Attention has focused on AGN triggering by means of major galaxy mergers gravitationally funneling gas toward the galactic center, with evidence both for and against this scenario. However, several recent studies have found that radio-loud AGN overwhelmingly reside in ongoing or recent major galaxy mergers. In this study, we test the hypothesis that major galaxy mergers are important triggers for radio-loud AGN activity in powerful quasars during cosmic noon (1 ≲ z ≲ 2). To this end, we compare Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/IR observations of the z > 1 3CR radio-loud broad-lined quasars to three matched radio-quiet quasar control samples. We find strong evidence for major-merger activity in nearly all radio-loud AGN, in contrast to the much lower merger fraction in the radio-quiet AGN. These results suggest major galaxy mergers are key ingredients in launching powerful radio jets. Given many of our radio-loud quasars are blue, our results present a possible challenge to the “blowout” paradigm of galaxy evolution models in which blue quasars are the quiescent end result following a period of red quasar feedback initiated by a galaxy merger. Finally, we find a tight correlation between black hole mass and host galaxy luminosity for these different high-redshift AGN samples that is inconsistent with those observed for local elliptical galaxies.

<br /><br />总结:
2020年3月起，C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS)彗星的核心开始解体。作者使用长缝光谱和Xinglong 2.16米望远镜获取了该彗星的气体和尘埃特性的多色频带图像。观测显示C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS)在光学波段出现了CN、C2、C3和NH2等强发射带，这些是典型的彗星光谱特征。使用Haser模型导出的CN、C2和C3的产量表明C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS)在A'Hearn分类下是一个“典型”的Oort云彗星，尽管其尘埃量较少。其尘埃散射反射率略呈红色，这可以通过多孔尘埃模型来解释。 <div>
C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS) is an Oort cloud comet with an orbital period of ∼5895 yr. Starting in 2020 March, its nucleus underwent disintegration. In order to investigate the gas and dust properties of C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS) during its disintegration, we obtained long-slit spectra at 3600–8700 Å and BVRI multiband images with the Xinglong 2.16 m Telescope in 2020 April. Our observations revealed that C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS) exhibited strong emission bands of CN, C2, C3, and NH2, which are superimposed on a dust-scattering continuum, typical of cometary spectra in the optical. The production rates of CN, C2, and C3 derived using the Haser model and the corresponding C2/CN and C3/CN ratios suggest that C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS) is a “typical” Oort cloud comet under the A’Hearn classification, although it appears less dusty, as revealed by the Afρ quantities. Its dust-scattering reflectivity is slightly red, with a gradient of ∼5% per 103Å. We model the reflectivity gradient in terms of porous dust and find that the red color is accounted for by porous dust.

<div> TESS, afterglows, GRBs, observational study, cadence
总结:<br /><br />该研究利用TESS对伽马射线暴的余辉进行了观测，在TESS的数据中检测到11个候选信号，其中3个被分类为高可能性的伽马射线暴余辉，5个被分类为暂定，其余被认为不太可能。研究使用afterglowpy软件对每个候选光变曲线进行了建模，得出爆发与余辉出现之间平均时间延迟为740±690秒的结果。该研究表明，TESS因其高观测频率和广阔的视场，在定位伽马射线暴方面具有巨大潜力，能够观测到之前光学望远镜无法达到的时间尺度上的余辉。 <div>
Gamma-ray bursts produce afterglows that can be observed across the electromagnetic spectrum and can provide insight into the nature of their progenitors. While most telescopes that observe afterglows are designed to rapidly react to trigger information, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) continuously monitors sections of the sky at cadences between 30 minutes and 200 s. This provides TESS with the capability of serendipitously observing the optical afterglow of GRBs. We conduct the first extensive search for afterglows of known GRBs in archival TESS data reduced with the TESSreduce package, and detect 11 candidate signals that are temporally coincident with reported burst times. We classify three of these as high-likelihood GRB afterglows previously unknown to have been detected by TESS, one of which has no other afterglow detection reported on the Gamma-ray Coordinates Network. We classify five candidates as tentative and the remainder as unlikely. Using the afterglowpy package, we model each of the candidate light curves with a Gaussian and a top-hat model to estimate burst parameters; we find that a mean time delay of 740 ± 690 s between the explosion and afterglow onset is required to perform these fits. The high cadence and large field of view make TESS a powerful instrument for localising GRBs, with the potential to observe afterglows in cases when no other backup photometry is possible, and at timescales previously unreachable by optical telescopes.

<div> 星系，微波辐射，MALATANG，亮度，恒星形成<br />总结:<br />本研究利用韩国VLBI网络进行了单天线观测，以探寻附近星系中的异常微波辐射。研究选择了来自James Clerk Maxwell望远镜的遗产调查项目“Mapping the dense molecular gas in the strongest star-forming galaxies”（MALATANG）中的目标星系。通过与其他数据的结合，研究了5个星系的无线电-红外谱能分布（SED），并在其中的NGC 2903星系中明显探测到了AME信号。而NGC 2146和M82星系中的AME信号则较弱。NGC 1068和Arp 299星系中未观测到明显的AME信号，研究给出了AME的上限。最拟合的SED显示出AME成分在频率更高且峰值流量更强的局部峰值，这暗示AME的起源可能是分子云或光解离区这样的密集环境，而非常见的暖中性/电离介质。此外，AME被发现更喜欢具有更高特定恒星形成速率的目标星系，而不是AGN宿主。因此，这可能暗示AGN对微尘来说是过于恶劣的环境。 <div>
We present the results of the single-dish observations using the Korean VLBI Network to search for anomalous microwave emission (AME) in nearby galaxies. The targets were selected from ‘Mapping the dense molecular gas in the strongest star-forming galaxies' (MALATANG), a legacy survey project of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. The MALATANG galaxies are good representatives of local galaxies with enhanced nuclear activity associated with star formation and/or active galactic nuclei (AGNs), providing IR-bright galaxy samples; thus, they are good candidates for AME hosts. Combining with ancillary data, we investigated the radio–IR spectral energy distribution (SED), while searching for AME signals in five galaxies. The AME in NGC 2903 was well detected at a significant confidence level, whereas that in NGC 2146 and M82 was marginal. NGC 1068 and Arp 299 indicated no significant hints, and we provide upper limits for the AME. The best-fit SED exhibited local peaks of the AME components at higher frequencies and with stronger peak fluxes than those in previous studies. This suggested that AME originates from denser environments such as molecular clouds or photodissociation regions rather than warm neutral/ionized medium as commonly suggested by previous studies. Further, our AME-detected targets were observed to exhibit higher specific star formation rates than the other extragalactic AME hosts. Furthermore, AME favored starburst galaxies among our sample rather than AGN hosts. Consequently, this might imply that AGNs are excessively harsh environments for tiny dust to survive.

扩展壳体的负速度可以归因于老超新星的气体，但膨胀壳体的推移对应物在哪里？通过λ-21厘米银河中性氢EBHIS调查的数据显示，接近的和远离的氢气壳体形成了复杂K的一部分。高蓝移速度来自于氢气进入低密度的星际空间环境。数据还显示远离的边缘的特征，表明了壳体的远离排放。如果做出壳体均匀且球对称的简化假设，那么爆炸约在3 × 105年前发生。动量p ∼ 7 × 104M⊙ km s−1，与近期模型估计的超新星演化相吻合。第三次盖亚数据发布识别的几个双星系统可能是复杂K中异常速度H i气体的超新星爆炸来源。通过几个带有中子星候选者的双星系统确定了讨论中H i特征的距离。 <br /><br />总结:这篇文章探讨了高速云的一个悬而未决的谜团，通过对观测数据的分析，发现了远离和接近壳体的特征，揭示了超新星爆炸可能是导致复杂K中异常速度氢气的原因，并通过多种观测数据和模型估计得出了有关爆炸发生的时间和动量的信息。 <div>
We address one of the lingering mysteries of high-velocity clouds: If the anomalous negative velocities are the result of the approaching gas from old supernovae, then where are the receding counterparts of the expanding shells? Data from the λ-21 cm Galactic neutral hydrogen EBHIS survey (Winkel et al.) show multiple signatures of the expanding shells. The near-side (approaching) H i shells form part of Complex K. The high blueshifted velocities result from the H i moving into the low-density environment of inter-arm space. The H i data also show a distinctive, bow-shaped feature, the signature of the far-side (receding) emission of an expanding shell. The low redshifted velocity results from the gas expanding into volumes of space with a higher density. If we make the simplifying assumptions that the expansion of the shells is uniform and spherically symmetric, then the explosions took place about ⪅3 × 105 yr ago. The momentum, p ∼ 7 × 104M⊙ km s−1, agrees with recent model estimates for supernova evolution. Supernova explosions attributed to the unseen companion in several binary systems identified by the Third Gaia Data Release may be responsible for anomalous-velocity H i gas in Complex K. Four binary star systems with neutron-star candidates are located at the edge of the Sagittarius spiral arm and used to determine the distance to the H i features discussed here.

Using data from ALFALFA, xGASS, H i-MaNGA, and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we identify a sample of 47 “red but H i-rich” (RR) galaxies with near-UV (NUV) − r > 5 and unusually high H i-to-stellar mass ratios. We compare the optical properties and local environments between the RR galaxies and a control sample of “red and H i-normal” (RN) galaxies that are matched in stellar mass and color. The two samples are similar in the optical properties typical of massive red (quenched) galaxies in the local Universe. The RR sample tends to be associated with slightly lower-density environments and has lower clustering amplitudes and smaller neighbor counts at scales from several hundred kiloparsecs to a few megaparsecs. The results are consistent with the RR galaxies being preferentially located at the center of low-mass halos, with a median halo mass ∼1012h−1M⊙ compared to ∼1012.5h−1M⊙ for the RN sample. This result is confirmed by the SDSS group catalog, which reveals a central fraction of 89% for the RR sample, compared to ∼60% for the RN sample. If assumed to follow the H i size–mass relation of normal galaxies, the RR galaxies have an average H i-to-optical radius ratio of RHI/R90 ∼ 4, four times the average ratio for the RN sample. We compare our RR sample with similar samples in previous studies, and quantify the population of RR galaxies using the SDSS complete sample. We conclude that the RR galaxies form a unique but rare population, accounting for only a small fraction of the massive quiescent galaxy population. We discuss the formation scenarios of the RR galaxies.

2022年9月5日，太阳探测器帕克太阳探测器首次直接在日冕中进行了快速日冕物质抛射（CME）和冲击的原地测量。通过对帕克太阳探测器在近日点附近的原地测量，可以推测出两个冲击，第二个冲击已经衰减，与日冕图像中观察到的两次喷发一致。尽管发生了侧面穿越，测量结果表明了年轻喷射物的独特特征：等离子体的温度远高于环境介质，这表明了一个热的太阳源，并且大的等离子体β值表明了一个高度非力自由状态以及热压梯度对CME加速和膨胀的重要性。对全球日冕磁场的重建显示了日球际电流片（HCS）的长时间变化，观察到的磁场极性反转与更弯曲的HCS配置相符。在HCS穿越的内部观察到了重新连接迹象，深入到声速临界点。由于重新连接发生在次阿尔文速度风中，重新连接后的磁通量可以朝向太阳闭合，有助于平衡太阳圈中的磁通量。在HCS穿越后，次阿尔文速度风的性质作为低马赫数边界层（LMBL）导致在意外大的距离上进行了近亚声速等离子体的原位测量。 <div>
We report on the first direct in situ measurements of a fast coronal mass ejection (CME) and shock in the corona, which occurred on 2022 September 5. In situ measurements from the Parker Solar Probe spacecraft near perihelion suggest two shocks, with the second one decayed, which is consistent with more than one eruption in coronagraph images. Despite a flank crossing, the measurements indicate unique features of the young ejecta: a plasma much hotter than the ambient medium, suggestive of a hot solar source, and a large plasma β implying a highly non-force-free state and the importance of thermal pressure gradient for CME acceleration and expansion. Reconstruction of the global coronal magnetic fields shows a long-duration change in the heliospheric current sheet (HCS), and the observed field polarity reversals agree with a more warped HCS configuration. Reconnection signatures are observed inside an HCS crossing as deep as the sonic critical point. As the reconnection occurs in the sub-Alfvénic wind, the reconnected flux sunward of the reconnection site can close back to the Sun, which helps balance magnetic flux in the heliosphere. The nature of the sub-Alfvénic wind after the HCS crossing as a low Mach-number boundary layer (LMBL) leads to in situ measurements of the near subsonic plasma at a surprisingly large distance. Specifically, an LMBL may provide favorable conditions for the crossings of the sonic critical point in addition to the Alfvén surface.

We estimate the mass of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using the kinematics of 30 LMC globular clusters (GCs). We combine proper motions measured with the Hubble Space Telescope, Gaia, or a combination of the two, from a recent study by Bennet et al. with literature line-of-sight velocities (LOSVs) to give three components of motion. With these, we derive a 3D velocity dispersion anisotropy , consistent with the GCs forming a flattened system with significant azimuthal motion. We then apply a tracer mass estimator and measure an enclosed mass M⊙. This is broadly consistent with results from previous studies of the LOSVs of GCs and other luminous tracers. Assuming a cosmologically constrained Navarro–Frenk–White distribution for the dark matter, this implies a virial mass M⊙. Despite being an extrapolation by almost an order of magnitude in radius, this result is consistent with published estimates from other methods that are directly sensitive to the LMC’s total mass. Our results support the conclusion that the LMC is approximately % of the Milky Way’s mass, making it a significant contributor to the Local Group potential.

<br /><br />总结:
这篇文章研究了M101中最近发生的Type Ia超新星SN 2011fe并通过发现和分类211个周期在240-400天之间的Miras，在Hubble Space Telescope (HST)的观测基础上得出了M101的第一个Mira基础距离。通过采用绝对标定的Mira周期-光度关系，得出了M101的距离，并发现了SN Ia的峰值亮度。作者还通过超新星Ia的哈勃图得出了Hubble常数H0 = 72.37 ± 2.97 km s−1 Mpc−1，这是Mirasa的4.1%测量值。最后得出的结论是，与最近的Cepheid距离梯度测量结果相比，本地宇宙的H0值高于早期宇宙的值，并且在95%的置信水平上证实了这一点。 <div>
The giant spiral galaxy M101 is host to the nearest recent Type Ia supernova (SN 2011fe) and thus has been extensively monitored in the near-infrared to study the late-time light curve of the SN. Leveraging this existing baseline of observations, we derive the first Mira-based distance to M101 by discovering and classifying a sample of 211 Miras with periods ranging from 240–400 days in the SN field. Combined with new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3/IR channel observations, our data set totals 11 epochs of F110W (HST YJ) and 13 epochs of F160W (HST H) data spanning ∼2900 days. We adopt absolute calibrations of the Mira period–luminosity relation based on geometric distances to the Large Magellanic Cloud and the water megamaser host galaxy NGC 4258, and find μM101 = 29.10 ± 0.06 mag. This distance is in 1σ agreement with most other recent Cepheid and tip of the red giant branch distance measurements to M101. Including the previous Mira SN Ia host, NGC 1559, and SN 2005df, we determine the fiducial SN Ia peak luminosity, mag. With the Hubble diagram of supernovae Ia, we derive H0 = 72.37 ± 2.97 km s−1 Mpc−1, a 4.1% measurement of H0 using Miras. We find excellent agreement with recent Cepheid distance ladder measurements of H0 and confirm previous indications that the local universe value of H0 is higher than the early universe value at ∼95% confidence. Currently, the Mira-based H0 measurement is still dominated by the statistical uncertainty in the SN Ia peak magnitude.

<div> 关键词: Parker Solar Probe, 太阳风, 阿尔芬速度, 速度相关性, 磁场波动

总结:
Parker Solar Probe自2021年4月以来的数据显示了太阳冠层的原位观测，揭示了太阳风形成和加速的过程。研究利用PSP的数据探究了α-质子速度差和它们在临界阿尔芬面（CAS）附近的特征。首先展示了α-质子差速度与PSP遭遇距离处的太阳风速度的正相关性。然后探讨了差速流在CAS附近的特征以及它们如何受到阿尔芬波动的影响。研究发现，在CAS以下，差速度通常小于CAS以上的差速度，并且局部阿尔芬速度很好地限制了差速。而当出现较大幅度的阿尔芬波动和差速减小时，即出现了差速与局部磁场矢量对齐度的偏差。此外，PSP观测到α质子速度从MA < 1到MA ≃ 2增加，然后开始减小，这表明α粒子可能在CAS以上仍然保持优先加速状态。我们的结果还揭示，在亚阿尔芬太阳风中，质子和α粒子的速度波动与磁场波动之间存在强烈的相关性，对于α粒子来说相关性较弱。相比之下，在超阿尔芬太阳风中，质子的相关性保持高水平，但对于α粒子而言则减弱。 <div>
Data obtained from Parker Solar Probe (PSP) since 2021 April have shown the first in situ observation of the solar corona, where the solar wind is formed and accelerated. Here, we investigate the alpha-proton differential flow and its characteristics across the critical Alfvén surface (CAS) using data from PSP during encounters 8–10 and 12–13. We first show the positive correlation between the alpha-proton differential velocity and the bulk solar wind speed at PSP encounter distances. Then we explore how the characteristics of the differential flow vary across the CAS and how they are affected by Alfvénic fluctuations including switchbacks. We find that the differential velocity below the CAS is generally smaller than that above the CAS, and the local Alfvén speed well limits the differential speed both above and below the CAS. The deviations from the alignment between the differential velocity and the local magnetic field vector are accompanied by large-amplitude Alfvénic fluctuations and decreases in the differential speed. Moreover, we observe that Vαp increases from MA < 1 to MA ≃ 2 and then starts to decrease, which suggests that alphas may remain preferentially accelerated well above the CAS. Our results also reveal that in the sub-Alfvénic solar wind both protons and alphas show a strong correlation between their velocity fluctuations and magnetic field fluctuations, with a weaker correlation for alphas. By contrast, in the super-Alfvénic regime the correlation remains high for protons, but is reduced for alphas.

<div> 辐射流体力学、原行星盘、H2泵浦、尘埃-气体质量比、质量损失率
总结:
辐射流体力学模拟原行星盘的结构和演化，显示H2泵浦和X射线加热在尘埃-气体质量比较低时对盘的质量损失有更强烈的贡献。盘的质量损失率随着尘埃减少而减小，但仍然维持在10^-10-11M⊙yr^-1左右。在这些缺乏尘埃的盘中，H2泵浦增强了内盘区域的光蒸发并塑造了盘的质量损失曲线。因此，我们认为晚期盘的演化受到紫外H2泵浦效应的影响。我们模拟得出的质量损失率可用于研究长期盘演化。 <div>
We perform radiation hydrodynamics simulations to study the structure and evolution of a photoevaporating protoplanetary disk. Ultraviolet and X-ray radiation from the host star heats the disk surface, where H2 pumping also operates efficiently. We run a set of simulations in which we varied the number of dust grains or the dust-to-gas mass ratio, which determines the relative importance between photoelectric heating and H2 pumping. We show that H2 pumping and X-ray heating contribute more strongly to the mass loss of the disk when the dust-to-gas mass ratio is . The disk mass-loss rate decreases with a lower dust amount, but remains around 10−10−11M⊙yr−1. In these dust-deficient disks, H2 pumping enhances photoevaporation from the inner disk region and shapes the disk mass-loss profile. We thus argue that the late-stage disk evolution is affected by the ultraviolet H2 pumping effect. The mass-loss rates derived from our simulations can be used in the study of long-term disk evolution.

<title>On the Formation of Double Neutron Stars in the Milky Way: Influence of Key Parameters</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The detection of gravitational wave events has stimulated theoretical modeling of the formation and evolution of double compact objects (DCOs). However, even for the most studied isolated binary evolution channel, there exist large uncertainties in the input parameters and treatments of the binary evolution process. So far, double neutron stars (DNSs) are the only DCOs for which direct observations are available through traditional electromagnetic astronomy. In this work, we adopt a population synthesis method to investigate the formation and evolution of Galactic DNSs. We construct 324 models for the formation of Galactic DNSs, taking into account various possible combinations of critical input parameters and processes such as mass transfer efficiency, supernova type, common envelope efficiency, neutron star kick velocity, and pulsar selection effect. We employ Bayesian analysis to evaluate the adopted models by comparing with observations. We also compare the expected DNS merger rate in the galaxy with that inferred from the known Galactic population of pulsar-neutron star systems. Based on these analyses we derive the favorable range of the aforementioned key parameters.

<title>Solar Spicules, Filigrees, and Solar Wind Switchbacks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Spicules, the smallest observable jetlike dynamic features ubiquitous in the chromosphere, are supposedly an important potential source for small-scale solar wind transients, with supporting evidence yet needed. We studied the high-resolution Hα images (0.″10) and magnetograms (0.″29) from the Big Bear Solar Observatory to find that spicules are an ideal candidate for the solar wind magnetic switchbacks detected by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). It is not that spicules are a miniature of coronal jets, but that they have unique properties not found in other solar candidates in explaining solar origin of switchbacks. (1) The spicules under this study originate from filigrees, all in a single magnetic polarity. Since filigrees are known as footpoints of open fields, the spicule guiding field lines can form a unipolar funnel, which is needed to create an SB patch, a group of field lines that switch from one common base polarity to the other polarity. (2) The spicules come in a cluster lined up along a supergranulation boundary, and the simulated waiting times from their spatial intervals exhibit a number distribution continuously decreasing from a few seconds to ∼30 minutes, similar to that of switchbacks. (3) From a time–distance map for spicules, we estimate their occurrence rate as 0.55 spicules Mm−2 s−1, which is sufficiently high for detection by PSP. In addition, the dissimilarity of spicules with coronal jets, including the absence of base brightening and low correlation with EUV emission, is briefly discussed.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
1RXS J083842.1−282723 is a nearly synchronous magnetic cataclysmic variable with a simple X-ray light curve. While its orbital period was fairly well established at Porb = 98.4 minutes from optical spectroscopy, indirect estimates of Pspin/Porb ranged from 0.90 to 0.96 because the short X-ray light curves could not determine the beat period to a factor of 2. We analyze a recent 50 days TESS observation, and ground-based optical time-series photometry spanning 9 yr, that together measure precise beat, orbit, and spin periods and enable the X-ray and optical modulations to be phase aligned. Although the X-ray light curves do not distinguish between a beat period of 16.11 or 32.22 hr, all of the optical evidence favors the longer value, with complete pole switching of accretion every half beat cycle. This would require Pspin/Porb = 0.952. Long-term optical monitoring also shows a decline in accretion rate, and a change in the beat-folded light curve. It would be useful to obtain a new X-ray/optical observation of at least 32 hr duration to examine any associated change in accretion structure, and to confirm the spin and beat periods.

<title>Investigation of Nulling and Subpulse-drifting Properties of PSR J1649+2533 with FAST</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the nulling and subpulse-drifting properties of PSR J1649+2533 with observations of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST). The FAST observations reveal that the nulling fraction of this pulsar is about 20.9% ± 0.8% at 1250 MHz. The statistical study of the durations of the nulling and burst states shows that the burst states can persist for extended pulse periods, exceeding 100 periods in some cases, while the shortest lasts only a few pulse periods. The null states have a much shorter duration, with a maximum duration of less than 30 pulse periods. A comparative study between the pulse profiles of the first active pulse (FAP) and the last active pulse (LAP) shows that the pulse profiles of LAPs are stronger and wider than those of FAPs. An analysis of the two-dimensional fluctuation spectrum for the single-pulse stack indicates that the pulsar exhibits clear amplitude modulation and subpulse drifting. The periods are a P3 = 2.5 ± 0.1 spin period and P2 = 17.°0 ± 0.°5 at 1250 MHz, respectively. In addition, the multiband investigation shows that P2 seems to increase with the increase of the observing frequency, i.e., P2 ∝ ν0.8±0.1. This seems to be caused by the increasing pulse-profile width with the frequency. The high-sensitivity FAST observations will enable a detailed understanding of the emission of this pulsar and provide important clues for theoretical studies of the radiation mechanism.

<div> 850 μm, polarization, circumstellar envelope, AGB star, grain alignment
<br /><br />
总结: 本研究对碳星IRC+10216的星周环境进行了850μm极化观测。研究发现850 μm极化的几何结构与Zeeman观测和CSE中的小尺度结构一致，可能由磁偶极子几何所致。此外，研究还提出了一个新的颗粒对齐机制，认为带电颗粒在磁场中运动时会绕着感应的电场进动，从而与磁场对齐。这一机制能够解释碳尘在光学、远红外和亚毫米波段的极化现象，只需考虑颗粒的电荷状态不同即可。 <div>
We present SCUBA-2/POL-2 850 μm polarimetric observations of the circumstellar envelope (CSE) of the carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star IRC+10216. Both far-IR (FIR) and optical polarization data indicate grains aligned with their long axis in the radial direction relative to the central star. The 850 μm polarization does not show this simple structure. The 850 μm data are indicative, albeit not conclusive, of a magnetic dipole geometry. Assuming such a simple dipole geometry, the resulting 850 μm polarization geometry is consistent with both Zeeman observations and small-scale structure in the CSE. While there is significant spectral-line polarization contained within the SCUBA-2 850 μm passband for the source, it is unlikely that our broadband polarization results are dominated by line polarization. To explain the required grain alignment, grain mineralogy effects, due to either fossil silicate grains from the earlier oxygen-rich AGB phase of the star or due to the incorporation of ferromagnetic inclusions in the largest grains, may play a role. We argue that the most likely explanation is due to a new alignment mechanism wherein a charged grain, moving relative to the magnetic field, precesses around the induced electric field and therefore aligns with the magnetic field. This mechanism is particularly attractive as the optical, FIR, and submillimeter-wave polarization of the carbon dust can then be explained in a consistent way, differing simply due to the charge state of the grains.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章报告了对天体潮裂事件（TDE）AT2020ksf/Gaia20cjk的X射线光谱的发现。在UV/光学峰值后约230天，X射线明亮度急剧增加。研究发现，在初始阶段没有显著的吸收特征，但在几天内出现，并在峰值后770天仍然被探测到。作者发现，简单的热连续模型结合幂律或中性吸收体并不能很好地描述这些特征。添加部分覆盖、低速离子化吸收体可以改善早期拟合，但在后期会失效。高速（速度约42,000 km/s）的离子化吸收体（UFO）可以很好地拟合所有数据。研究还讨论了X射线延迟的几种解释场景，以及更大尺度风反馈的潜力。这一发现的偶然性可能表明TDE中UFO的高发生率，缓解了与理论预期的某些张力。 <div>
Supermassive black holes can experience super-Eddington peak mass fallback rates following the tidal disruption of a star. The theoretical expectation is that part of the infalling material is expelled by means of an accretion disk wind, whose observational signature includes blueshifted absorption lines of highly ionized species in X-ray spectra. To date, however, only one such ultrafast outflow (UFO) has been reported in the tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN–14li. Here we report on the discovery of a transient absorption-like signature in X-ray spectra of the TDE AT2020ksf/Gaia20cjk (at a redshift of z = 0.092), following an X-ray brightening ∼230 days after UV/optical peak. We find that while no statistically significant absorption features are present initially, they appear on a timescale of several days and remain detected up to 770 days after peak. Simple thermal continuum models, combined with a power-law or neutral absorber, do not describe these features well. Adding a partial-covering, low-velocity ionized absorber improves the fit at early times but fails at late times. A high-velocity (vw ∼ 42,000 km s−1), ionized absorber (UFO) provides a good fit to all data. The few-day timescale of variability is consistent with expectations for a clumpy wind. We discuss several scenarios that could explain the X-ray delay, as well as the potential for larger-scale wind feedback. The serendipitous nature of the discovery could suggest a high incidence of UFOs in TDEs, alleviating some of the tension with theoretical expectations.

The era of the James Webb Space Telescope ushers stellar population models into uncharted territories, particularly at the high-redshift frontier. In a companion paper, we apply the Prospector Bayesian framework to jointly infer galaxy redshifts and stellar population properties from broadband photometry as part of the UNCOVER survey. Here we present a comprehensive error budget in spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling. Using a sample selected to have photometric redshifts higher than 9, we quantify the systematic shifts stemming from various model choices in inferred stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and age. These choices encompass different timescales for changes in the star formation history (SFH), nonuniversal stellar initial mass functions (IMF), and the inclusion of variable nebular abundances, gas density, and ionizing photon budget. We find that the IMF exerts the strongest influence on the inferred properties: the systematic uncertainties can be as much as 1 dex, 2–5 times larger than the formal reported uncertainties in mass and SFR, and importantly, exceed the scatter seen when using different SED fitting codes. Although the assumptions on the lower end of the IMF induce degeneracy, our findings suggest that a common practice in the literature of assessing uncertainties in SED-fitting processes by comparing multiple codes is substantively underestimating the true systematic uncertainty. Highly stochastic SFHs change the inferred SFH by much larger than the formal uncertainties, and introduce ∼0.8 dex systematics in SFR averaged over a short timescale and ∼0.3 dex systematics in average age. Finally, employing a flexible nebular emission model causes ∼0.2 dex systematic increase in mass and SFR, comparable to the formal uncertainty. This paper constitutes an initial step toward a complete uncertainty estimate in SED modeling.

混合对棕矮星和巨行星大气中的化学反应产生影响，而大气模型通常使用Kzz扩散参数来参数化这种混合。研究表明，金属丰度和C/O比值也会影响大气化学。本研究提出了Sonora Elf Owl自洁云的大气网格模型，覆盖了几个数量级的Kzz变化以及次太阳到超太阳金属丰度和C/O比值。观察发现，在金属贫乏的物体中，Kzz对大气的影响在较高有效温度下较大，而在富金属的大气中，Kzz的影响则出现在较低有效温度下。研究还发现，在3-5μm波长窗口存在Kzz和金属丰度的光谱重叠。通过自洁模型，我们发现这些物体中存在很低效的垂直混合，推测的Kzz值在约101-104 cm2 s-1之间。观测揭示了这种缓慢的垂直混合是由于探测到了这些大气中深层脱离的辐射区的混合。 <br /><br />总结: 混合对大气化学有影响，金属丰度和C/O比值也会影响大气化学；Sonora Elf Owl网格模型包含了Kzz变化、金属丰度和C/O比值，研究发现在不同条件下Kzz对大气产生不同影响；研究发现在特定波长范围存在Kzz和金属丰度的光谱重叠；对九个早至晚T型物体进行观测，并发现了垂直混合效率较低的迹象；观测揭示了这种缓慢的垂直混合是由于探测到了这些大气中深层脱离的辐射区的混合。 <div>
Disequilibrium chemistry due to vertical mixing in the atmospheres of many brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets is well established. Atmosphere models for these objects typically parameterize mixing with the highly uncertain Kzz diffusion parameter. The role of mixing in altering the abundances of C-N-O-bearing molecules has mostly been explored for atmospheres with a solar composition. However, atmospheric metallicity and the C/O ratio also impact atmospheric chemistry. Therefore, we present the Sonora Elf Owl grid of self-consistent cloud-free 1D radiative-convective equilibrium model atmospheres for JWST observations, which includes a variation in Kzz across several orders of magnitude and also encompasses subsolar to supersolar metallicities and C/O ratios. We find that the impact of Kzz on the T(P) profile and spectra is a strong function of both Teff and metallicity. For metal-poor objects, Kzz has large impacts on the atmosphere at significantly higher Teff than in metal-rich atmospheres, where the impact of Kzz is seen to occur at lower Teff. We identify significant spectral degeneracies between varying Kzz and metallicity in multiple wavelength windows, in particular, at 3–5 μm. We use the Sonora Elf Owl atmospheric grid to fit the observed spectra of a sample of nine early to late T-type objects from Teff = 550–1150 K. We find evidence for very inefficient vertical mixing in these objects, with inferred Kzz values lying in the range between ∼101 and 104 cm2 s−1. Using self-consistent models, we find that this slow vertical mixing is due to the observations, which probe mixing in the deep detached radiative zone in these atmospheres.

ALMA观测了Orion B分子云中与HH270mms1相关的原恒星流。通过12CO (J = 3−2)的发射，发现分子流的速度结构包括低速度、中速度、高速度和包围低速度分子的夹带气体的速度。高速和中速流具有良好的聚束结构，而节点链嵌入在高速流或射流中。通过观测发现，低速和中速分子流中存在垂直于流轴线的速度梯度。确认了外层和盘的旋转，并发现它们的速度梯度与分子流相同。此外，根据观测到的分子流特性，估计了低速和中速流的发射半径，得出了射流从内盘区域驱动的结论。文章内容符合最近的理论研究的预期特征。<br /><br />总结: 分子流呈现出低速度、中速度和高速度结构，嵌入着射流和旋转特性。观测结果符合最新的理论研究。 <div>
We present molecular line observations of the protostellar outflow associated with HH270mms1 in the Orion B molecular cloud with ALMA. The 12CO (J = 3−2) emissions show that the outflow velocity structure consists of four distinct components of low (≲10 km s−1), intermediate (∼10–25 km s−1) and high (≳40 km s−1) velocities in addition to the entrained gas velocity (∼25–40 km s−1). The high- and intermediate-velocity flows have well-collimated structures surrounded by the low-velocity flow. The chain of knots is embedded in the high-velocity flow or jet, which is the evidence of episodic mass ejections induced by time-variable mass accretion. We could detect the velocity gradients perpendicular to the outflow axis in both the low- and intermediate-velocity flows. We confirmed the rotation of the envelope and disk in the 13CO and C17O emission and found that their velocity gradients are the same as those of the outflow. Thus, we concluded that the velocity gradients in the low- and intermediate-velocity flows are due to the outflow rotation. Using observational outflow properties, we estimated the outflow launching radii to be 67.1–77.1 au for the low-velocity flow and 13.3–20.8 au for the intermediate-velocity flow. Although we could not detect the rotation in the jets due to the limited spatial resolution, we estimated the jet launching radii to be (2.36–3.14) × 10−2 au using the observed velocity of each knot. Thus, the jet is driven from the inner disk region. We could identify the launching radii of distinct velocity components within a single outflow with all the prototypical characteristics expected from recent theoretical works.

总结:
这篇文章介绍了一种利用卷积神经网络(CNN)对类星体的多波段光谱能量分布(SEDs)进行建模的新方法。他们在一种包括同步辐射和逆Compton发射的轻子模型上训练了CNN。这种方法显著减少了计算时间，实现了对多波段数据集的实时拟合。他们还展示了如何使用训练好的CNN和MultiNest来拟合Mrk 421和1ES 1959+650的宽带SEDs，并成功获得了它们的参数后验分布。这种新的SED拟合框架将进一步扩展，以加入基于外部Compton和强子场景的更复杂模型，并通过Markarian多波段数据中心的网页界面公开提供这些模型，以促进类星体观测的多信使数据的自洽建模。<br /><br /> <div>
Modeling the multiwavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of blazars provides key insights into the underlying physical processes responsible for the emission. While SED modeling with self-consistent models is computationally demanding, it is essential for a comprehensive understanding of these astrophysical objects. We introduce a novel, efficient method for modeling the SEDs of blazars by the mean of a convolutional neural network (CNN). In this paper, we trained the CNN on a leptonic model that incorporates synchrotron and inverse Compton emissions, as well as self-consistent electron cooling and pair creation–annihilation processes. The CNN is capable of reproducing the radiative signatures of blazars with high accuracy. This approach significantly reduces the computational time, thereby enabling real-time fitting to multiwavelength data sets. As a demonstration, we used the trained CNN with MultiNest to fit the broadband SEDs of Mrk 421 and 1ES 1959+650, successfully obtaining their parameter posterior distributions. This novel framework for fitting the SEDs of blazars will be further extended to incorporate more sophisticated models based on external Compton and hadronic scenarios, allowing for multimessenger constraints in the analysis. The models will be made publicly available via a web interface at the Markarian Multiwavelength Data Center to facilitate self-consistent modeling of multimessenger data from blazar observations.

<div> 关键词: 太阳能粒子事件, 元素丰度增强, 电子分布, 离子化相互作用, 温度估计

总结:
太阳能粒子（SEP）事件的重要方面是它们的来源群体。文章探讨了来自假定的日冕重连事件的冲击SEP事件的元素丰度增强，以及在加速过程中电子分布的影响，以及离子化相互作用对电荷状态的影响。研究发现，电子速度分布是否偏离麦克斯韦分布并不显著影响加速区温度的估计。这表明SEP在较短时间内加速并离开加速区，与离子化时间尺度相比。 <br /><br /> <div>
An important aspect of solar energetic particle (SEP) events is their source populations. Elemental abundance enhancements of impulsive SEP events, originating in presumed coronal reconnection episodes, can be fitted to steep power laws of A/Q, where A and Q are the atomic mass and ionic charge. Since thermal electron energies are enhanced and nonthermal electron distributions arise in the reconnection process, we might expect that ionic charge states Q would be increased through ionization interactions with those electron populations during the acceleration process. The temperature estimated from the SEPs corresponds to the charge state during the acceleration process, while the actual charge state measured in situ may be modified as the SEPs pass through the corona. We examine whether the temperature estimation from the A/Q would differ with various κ values in a κ function representing high-energy tail deviating from a Maxwellian velocity distribution. We find that the differences in the A/Q between a Maxwellian and an extreme κ distribution are about 10%–30%. We fit power-law enhancement of element abundances as a function of their A/Q with various κ values. Then, we find that the derived source region temperature is not significantly affected by whether or not the electron velocity distribution deviates from a Maxwellian, i.e., thermal, distribution. Assuming that electrons are heated in the acceleration region, the agreement of the SEP charge state during acceleration with typical active region temperatures suggests that SEPs are accelerated and leave the acceleration region in a shorter time than the ionization timescale.

Estimating the magnetic field strength in the solar corona is crucial for understanding different physical processes happening over diverse spatiotemporal scales. However, the high temperatures and low density of the solar corona make this task challenging. The coronal magnetic field is too weak to produce a measurable splitting of the spectral lines using the Zeeman effect, and high temperature causes spectral lines to become weak and broad, making it difficult to detect the small Zeeman splitting. Coronal magneto-seismology, which combines the theoretical and observed properties of magnetohydrodynamic waves, can be used to infer the magnetic field strength of oscillating structures in the solar corona, which are otherwise difficult to estimate. In this work, we use the Doppler velocity and density data obtained from the Coronal Multichannel Polarimeter on 2016 October 14 to obtain the global map of the coronal magnetic field using Bayesian inference. Two priors are used for plasma density, viz Gaussian and uniform distributions. Bayesian inference provides us with the probability distribution for the magnetic field strength at each location from 1.05 to 1.35 R⊙. A comparison between the magnetic field obtained using simple inversion and Bayesian inference is also drawn. We find that the values obtained using simple inversion do not always match the maximum posterior estimates obtained using Bayesian inference. We find that the inferred values follow a power-law function for the radial variation of the coronal magnetic field, with the power-law indices for simple and Bayesian inversion being similar.

<title>Self-consistent Conditions for 26Al Injection into a Protosolar Disk from a Nearby Supernova</title>

<div> 关键词: 早期太阳系，26Al，超新星，原行星盘，太阳系起源<br />
总结: 早期太阳系含有一种短寿命放射性核素26Al，据信它的衰变能控制了小行星的热演化，可能也影响了行星的水含量。一种可能的假设是“盘注入情形”，即在原行星盘形成后，附近(<1 pc)的超新星将放射性物质直接注入盘中。然而，研究发现需要超新星产生的26Al量很大，且注入后会改变盘的温度，这与太阳系的实际情况不符。因此，推测早期太阳系中的新鲜26Al可能以其他方式合成/注入。 <div>
The early solar system contained a short-lived radionuclide, 26Al (its half-life time t1/2 = 0.7 Myr). The decay energy of 26Al is thought to have controlled the thermal evolution of planetesimals and, possibly, the water contents of planets. Many hypotheses have been proposed for the origin of 26Al in the solar system. One of the possible hypotheses is the “disk injection scenario”: when the protoplanetary disk of the solar system had already formed, a nearby (<1 pc) supernova injected radioactive material directly into the disk. Such a 26Al injection hypothesis has been tested so far with limited setups for disk structure and supernova distance, which have treated disk disruption and 26Al injection separately. Here, we revisit this problem, to investigate whether there are self-consistent conditions under which the surviving disk radius can receive enough 26Al to account for the abundance in the early solar system. We also consider a range of disk masses and structures, 26Al yields from supernova, and a large dust mass fraction ηd. We find that 26Al yields of supernova are required as , which are challenging to achieve with the known possible 26Al ejection and dust mass fraction ranges. Furthermore, we find that even if the above conditions are met, the supernova flow changes the disk temperature, which may not be consistent with the solar system record. Our results place a strong constraint on the disk injection scenario. Rather, we suggest that the fresh 26Al of the early solar system must have been synthesized/injected in other ways.

We summarize the entire known sample of these types of companion systems, termed “compositional benchmarks,” that are present in the literature or recently published as key systems of study in order to best understand brown dwarf chemistry and condensate formation. Via mass balance and stoichiometric calculations, we predict a median brown dwarf atmospheric oxygen sink of by utilizing published stellar abundances in the local solar neighborhood. Additionally, we predict a silicate condensation sequence such that atmospheres with bulk Mg/Si ≲0.9 will form enstatite (MgSiO3) and quartz (SiO2) clouds, and atmospheres with bulk Mg/Si ≳0.9 will form enstatite and forsterite (Mg2SiO4) clouds. The implications of these results on C/O ratio trends in substellar-mass objects and the utility of these predictions in future modeling work are discussed.

<title>AT2022cmc: A Tidal Disruption Event with a Two-component Jet in a Bondi-profile Circumnuclear Medium</title>

A supermassive black hole can launch a relativistic jet when it violently disrupts a star that passes too close. Such jetted tidal disruption events (TDEs) are rare and unique tools to investigate quiescent supermassive black holes, jet physics, and circumnuclear environments at high redshift. The newly discovered TDE AT2022cmc (z ∼ 1.193), providing rich multiband (X-ray, UV, optical, submillimeter, and radio) data, has been interpreted as the fourth on-axis jetted TDE. In this work, we constrain the circumnuclear medium (CNM) density profile with both a closure relation test and detailed forward shock model fit with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to the multiband (optical, submillimeter, and radio) data of AT2022cmc. We find that the CNM density profile of AT2022cmc is n ∝ R−k with k ∼ 1.68, implying a Bondi accretion in history. Furthermore, our model fit result suggests a two-component jet in AT2022cmc, indicating similar jet physics to well-studied jetted TDE Sw J1644+57.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We observed the nearby radio pulsar B0950+08, which has a 100% duty cycle, using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope. We obtained the polarization profile for its entire rotation, which enabled us to investigate its magnetospheric radiation geometry and the sparking pattern of the polar cap. After we excluded part of the profile in which the linear polarization factor is low (≲30%) and potentially contaminated by jumps in position angle, the rest of the swing in polarization position angle fits a classical rotating vector model (RVM) well. The best-fit RVM indicates that the inclination angle, α, and the impact angle, β, of this pulsar, are 100.°5 and −33.°2, respectively, suggesting that the radio emission comes from two poles. We find that, in such RVM geometry, either the annular vacuum gap model or the core vacuum gap model would require that the radio emissions come from a high-altitude magnetosphere with heights from ∼0.25 RLC to ∼0.56 RLC, with RLC being the light cylinder radius. Both the main and interpulses’ sparking points are located away from the magnetic pole, which could relate to the physical conditions on the pulsar surface.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Space plasmas are turbulent and maintain different types of critical points or flow nulls. Electron vortex, as one type of flow null structure, is crucial in the energy cascade in turbulent plasmas. However, due to the limited time resolution of the spacecraft observations, one can never analyze the three-dimensional properties of the electron vortex. In the present study, with the advancement of the FOTE-V method and the unprecedented high-resolution measurements from four Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft, we successfully identify the electron vortex and then reconstruct its three-dimensional topology of the surrounding electron flow field. The results of the reconstruction show that the configuration of the electron vortex is elliptical. Comparison between the observation and reconstruction scales of the vortex indicates the reliable reconstruction of the flow velocity. Our study sheds light on the understanding of the topology and property of the electron vortex and its relationship with kinetic-scale magnetic holes.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using 20 long-term 3D core-collapse supernova simulations, we find that lower compactness progenitors that explode quasi-spherically due to the short delay to explosion experience smaller neutron star recoil kicks in the ∼100−200 km s−1 range, while higher compactness progenitors that explode later and more aspherically leave neutron stars with kicks in the ∼300−1000 km s−1 range. In addition, we find that these two classes are correlated with the gravitational mass of the neutron star. This correlation suggests that the survival of binary neutron star systems may in part be due to their lower kick speeds. We also find a correlation between the kick and both the mass dipole of the ejecta and the explosion energy. Furthermore, one channel of black hole birth leaves masses of ∼10 M⊙, is not accompanied by a neutrino-driven explosion, and experiences small kicks. A second channel is through a vigorous explosion that leaves behind a black hole with a mass of ∼3.0 M⊙ kicked to high speeds. We find that the induced spins of nascent neutron stars range from seconds to ∼10 ms, but do not yet see a significant spin/kick correlation for pulsars. We suggest that if an initial spin biases the explosion direction, a spin/kick correlation would be a common byproduct of the neutrino mechanism of core-collapse supernovae. Finally, the induced spin in explosive black hole formation is likely large and in the collapsar range. This new 3D model suite provides a greatly expanded perspective and appears to explain some observed pulsar properties by default.

We present a quantum treatment of atom–electron collisions in magnetic fields, demonstrating the significant importance of including the effect of exchange that arises from two interacting electrons. We find strange behaviors that are not encountered in collisions without a magnetic field. In high magnetic fields, exchange can lead to orders of magnitude enhancements of collision cross sections. Additionally, the elastic collision cross sections that involve the ground state become comparable to those involving excited states, and states with large orbits have the largest contribution to the collisions. We anticipate significant changes to spectral line broadening in neutron star surfaces and atmospheres.

总结: 
本文使用Bayesian方法对NANOGrav 12.5年数据进行了引力波记忆的搜索，未发现任何具有说服力的信号。通过更灵活的红噪声模型，与GW记忆信号相关的支持度减少至1.3。根据天空位置和事件时刻，我们计算了GW记忆事件的应变上限，发现中位数应变上限约为3.3×10^-14。部分天空位置的应变上限存在差异，PSR J0613−0200周围存在一些额外噪声可能与GW记忆混淆。最后，应变上限随着时间的推移而改善，这归因于脉冲星定时阵列的持续增长。 <div>
We present the results of a Bayesian search for gravitational wave (GW) memory in the NANOGrav 12.5 yr data set. We find no convincing evidence for any gravitational wave memory signals in this data set. We find a Bayes factor of 2.8 in favor of a model that includes a memory signal and common spatially uncorrelated red noise (CURN) compared to a model including only a CURN. However, further investigation shows that a disproportionate amount of support for the memory signal comes from three dubious pulsars. Using a more flexible red-noise model in these pulsars reduces the Bayes factor to 1.3. Having found no compelling evidence, we go on to place upper limits on the strain amplitude of GW memory events as a function of sky location and event epoch. These upper limits are computed using a signal model that assumes the existence of a common, spatially uncorrelated red noise in addition to a GW memory signal. The median strain upper limit as a function of sky position is approximately 3.3 × 10−14. We also find that there are some differences in the upper limits as a function of sky position centered around PSR J0613−0200. This suggests that this pulsar has some excess noise that can be confounded with GW memory. Finally, the upper limits as a function of burst epoch continue to improve at later epochs. This improvement is attributable to the continued growth of the pulsar timing array.

We present results from the search for astrometric accelerations of stars in ω Centauri using 13 yr of regularly scheduled Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/UVIS calibration observations in the cluster core. The high-precision astrometry of ∼160,000 sources was searched for significant deviations from linear proper motion. This led to the discovery of four cluster members and one foreground field star with compelling acceleration patterns. We interpreted them as the result of the gravitational pull by an invisible companion and determined preliminary Keplerian orbit parameters, including the companion’s mass. For the cluster members, our analysis suggests periods ranging from 8.8 to 19+ yr and dark companions in the mass range of ∼0.7 to ∼1.4M☉. At least one companion could exceed the upper mass boundary of white dwarfs and can be classified as a neutron star candidate.

<div> 关键词: 灰尘消光曲线, 近红外, 银河系, 星表测光, 壁画

总结: 这篇论文研究了银河系的灰尘消光曲线在近红外的特征，通过对SDSS和2MASS的星表数据进行分析，发现在低至中等灰尘密度范围内，消光曲线的斜率βNIR没有系统性变化，平均值为1.85。此外，发现βNIR与RV之间没有内在的相关性。这些结果对于typical sightlines是适用的，不包括靠近银心的尘埃密集区域或RV大于4的罕见视线。最后，发现RH = 0.345，这对Cepheid的校准和H0的测定有一定的影响。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
The Milky Way dust extinction curve in the near-infrared (NIR) follows a power-law form, but the value of the slope, βNIR, is debated. Systematic variations in the slope of the Milky Way UV extinction curve are known to be correlated with variations in the optical slope (through RV), but whether such a dependence extends to the NIR is unclear. Finally, because of low dust column densities, the NIR extinction law is poorly understood at high Galactic latitudes where most extragalactic work takes place. In this paper, we construct extinction curves from 56,649 stars with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Two Micron All Sky Survey photometry, based on stellar parameters from SDSS spectra. We use dust maps to identify dust-free stars, from which we calibrate the relation between stellar parameters and intrinsic colors. Furthermore, to probe the low-dust regime at high latitudes, we use aggregate curves based on many stars. We find no systematic variation of βNIR across low-to-moderate dust columns (0.02 < E(B − V) ≲ 1), and report average βNIR = 1.85 ± 0.01, in agreement with the law in the 2019 Fitzpatrick et al. study, but steeper than the Cardelli et al. and 1999 Fitzpatrick laws. Star-to-star scatter in βNIR is relatively small (σ(βNIR) = 0.13). We also find no intrinsic correlation between βNIR and RV (there is an apparent correlation that is the result of the correlated uncertainties in the two values). These results hold for typical sightlines; we do not probe very dusty regions near the Galactic Center, nor rare sightlines with RV > 4. Finally, we find RH = 0.345 ± 0.007 and comment on its bearing on Cepheid calibrations and the determination of H0.

Resolving the environments of massive stars is crucial for understanding their formation mechanisms and their impact on galaxy evolution. An important open question is whether massive stars found in diffuse regions outside spiral arms formed in situ or migrated there after forming in denser environments. To address this question, we use multiresolution measurements of extinction in the Andromeda galaxy (M31) to probe the interstellar medium surrounding massive stars across galactic environments. We construct a catalog of 42,107 main-sequence massive star candidates (M ≥ 8 M⊙) using resolved stellar photometry from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) program, plus stellar and dust model fits from the Bayesian Extinction and Stellar Tool (BEAST). We quantify galactic environments by computing surrounding stellar densities of massive stars using kernel density estimation. We then compare high-resolution line-of-sight extinction estimates from the BEAST with 25 pc resolution dust maps from PHAT, measuring the total column density distribution of extinction. Our key finding is that, although the average total column density of dust increases with the density of massive stars, the average line-of-sight extinction toward massive stars remains constant across all environments. This suggests that massive stars have a uniform amount of dust in their immediate environment, regardless of their location in the galaxy. One possible explanation for these findings is that small molecular clouds are still capable of forming massive stars, even if they are not resolvable at 25 pc. These results indicate that massive stars are forming in the sparse regions of M31, as opposed to migrating there.

在这项研究中，我们考虑了辐射冷却纤维状分子云在引力坍缩过程中的等离子扩散效应。我们考虑了磁场的两种不同配置，即轴向和环向，在等离子扩散的情况下，对于辐射冷却的纤维状分子云会导致两种不同的问题。在两种磁场配置下，纤维状分子云都会被等离子扩散辐射冷却和加热。我们使用自相似方法来求解每种情况下得到的方程。我们发现绝热指数和等离子扩散率在冷却纤维坍缩过程中起着非常重要的作用。结果表明，等离子加热显著增加了冷却纤维中间区域的温度。此外，我们发现等离子扩散在坍缩过程中具有非常重要的影响，以至于在冷却纤维中间区域，其加热效应比其动力学效应更为突出。得到的结果还提到了一些区域，那里的星体形成速率相对观测报告来说更多或更少。 <br /><br />总结: ambipolar diffusion对纤维状分子云的引力坍缩过程起着重要作用，其加热效应显著增加了纤维中间区域的温度。在一些区域，等离子扩散的影响使得星体形成速率有所不同。 <div>
In this study, we consider the effects of ambipolar diffusion during the gravitational collapse of a radiative cooling filamentary molecular cloud. Two separate configurations of magnetic field, i.e., axial and toroidal, are considered in the presence of the ambipolar diffusion for a radiative cooling filament. These configurations lead to two different formulations of the problem. The filament is radiatively cooled and heated by ambipolar diffusion in both cases of magnetic field configurations. The self-similar method is used to solve the obtained equations in each case. We found that the adiabatic exponent and ambipolar diffusivity play very important roles during the gravitational collapse of a cooling filament. The results show that the ambipolar heating significantly increases the temperature in the middle regions of a cooling filament. Furthermore, we found that the ambipolar diffusion has very important effects during the collapse, so that its heating effect is dominant over its dynamical effect in the middle regions of a cooling filament. The obtained results also address some regions where the rate of star formation is more or less compared to the observational reports.

总结:
DESI亮星系调查中的概率星族质量函数(pSMF)利用一次性调查观测的数据推导出星系的质量函数，使用了概率价值增值BGS (PROVABGS) 贝叶斯光谱能量分布建模框架，推导出了亮星系和暗星系样本的pSMF以及星系的红移演化。研究显示pSMF与文献中的质量函数测量结果相当一致，展示出DESI Bright Galaxy Survey在研究低红移时尺度关系的统计能力。 <div>
We present the probabilistic stellar mass function (pSMF) of galaxies in the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS), observed during the One-percent Survey. The One-percent Survey was one of DESI’s survey validation programs conducted from 2021 April to May, before the start of the main survey. It used the same target selection and similar observing strategy as the main survey and successfully observed the spectra and redshifts of 143,017 galaxies in the r < 19.5 magnitude-limited BGS Bright sample and 95,499 galaxies in the fainter surface-brightness- and color-selected BGS Faint sample over z < 0.6. We derive pSMFs from posteriors of stellar mass, M*, inferred from DESI photometry and spectroscopy using the Hahn et al. PRObabilistic Value-Added BGS (PROVABGS) Bayesian spectral energy distribution modeling framework. We use a hierarchical population inference framework that statistically and rigorously propagates the M* uncertainties. Furthermore, we include correction weights that account for the selection effects and incompleteness of the BGS observations. We present the redshift evolution of the pSMF in BGS, as well as the pSMFs of star-forming and quiescent galaxies classified using average specific star formation rates from PROVABGS. Overall, the pSMFs show good agreement with previous stellar mass function measurements in the literature. Our pSMFs showcase the potential and statistical power of BGS, which in its main survey will observe >100 × more galaxies. Moreover, we present the statistical framework for subsequent population statistics measurements using BGS, which will characterize the global galaxy population and scaling relations at low redshifts with unprecedented precision.

总结:
NGC 3603是银河系中最明亮的GH ii区域，通过中红外成像调查发现其辐射区域。利用多波段观测数据，发现了14个可能是MYSOs的紧凑源。同时，也检测到了3个大质量原行星盘候选体以及演化蓝色超巨星Sher 25的盘和喷流的尘埃辐射。通过多波段数据推导了NGC 3603内部星形成凝块的辐射-质量比和维里参数，估计了它们的相对年龄，并发现与之前研究过的GH ii区域相比，NGC 3603是一个年龄较大的GH ii区域，呈空腔型。相比于类似的连续裂解光子速率的分布型GH ii区域，NGC 3603的MYSOs和分子凝块数量较为适度。 <div>
We present our sixth set of results from our mid-infrared imaging survey of Milky Way Giant H ii regions with our detailed analysis of NGC 3603, the most luminous giant H ii (GH ii) region in the Galaxy. We used imaging data from the FORCAST instrument on the Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) at 20 and 37 μm, which mapped the central ∼8.′5 × 8.′5 infrared-emitting area of NGC 3603 at a spatial resolution of ≲3″. Utilizing these SOFIA data in conjunction with multiwavelength observations from the near-infrared to radio, including Spitzer-IRAC and Herschel-PACS archival data, we investigate the physical nature of individual infrared sources and subcomponents within NGC 3603. For individual compact sources, we used the multiwavelength photometry data to construct spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and fit them with massive young stellar object (MYSO) SED models, and find 14 sources that are likely to be MYSOs. We also detect dust emission from the 3 massive proplyd candidates, as well as from the disk and outflow of the evolved blue supergiant, Sher 25. Utilizing multiwavelength data, we derived luminosity-to-mass ratio and virial parameters for the star-forming clumps within NGC 3603, estimating their relative ages and finding that NGC 3603 is an older GH ii region overall, compared to our previously studied GH ii regions. We discuss how NGC 3603, which we categorize as a cavity-type GH ii region, exhibits a more modest number of MYSOs and molecular clumps when compared to the distributed-type GH ii regions that share similar Lyman continuum photon rates.

在这篇文章中，研究者使用了不同iable贝叶斯模型和Hamilton Monte Carlo方法来推断James Webb Space Telescope Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science观测中高红移星系的三维形态。他们发现高质量和低红移的星系呈现更加椭圆的形态，而高质量和高红移的星系呈现更加三轴对称的形态，暗示了星系的发展趋势。他们还同时推断了三维尺寸和质量之间的关系，以及其与三维几何形态的相关性。最后，他们讨论了选择效应、后续观测前景和理论意义。<br /> <div>
The 3D geometries of high-redshift galaxies remain poorly understood. We build a differentiable Bayesian model and use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to efficiently and robustly infer the 3D shapes of star-forming galaxies in James Webb Space Telescope Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science observations with at z = 0.5–8.0. We reproduce previous results from the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey in a fraction of the computing time and constrain the mean ellipticity, triaxiality, size, and covariances with samples as small as ∼50 galaxies. We find high 3D ellipticities for all mass–redshift bins, suggesting oblate (disky) or prolate (elongated) geometries. We break that degeneracy by constraining the mean triaxiality to be ∼1 for dwarfs at z > 1 (favoring the prolate scenario), with significantly lower triaxialities for higher masses and lower redshifts indicating the emergence of disks. The prolate population traces out a “banana” in the projected diagram with an excess of low-b/a, large- galaxies. The dwarf prolate fraction rises from ∼25% at z = 0.5–1.0 to ∼50%–80% at z = 3–8. Our results imply a second kind of disk settling from oval (triaxial) to more circular (axisymmetric) shapes with time. We simultaneously constrain the 3D size–mass relation and its dependence on 3D geometry. High-probability prolate and oblate candidates show remarkably similar Sérsic indices (n ∼ 1), nonparametric morphological properties, and specific star formation rates. Both tend to be visually classified as disks or irregular, but edge-on oblate candidates show more dust attenuation. We discuss selection effects, follow-up prospects, and theoretical implications.

AGN燃料来源的研究得到了促进，研究者通过Sloan数字化巡天IV（SDSS-IV）的MaNGA积分场谱学调查，建立了一个包含387个AGN的目录。通过结合MaNGA AGN目录和基于合并星系的一系列水动力学模拟识别的新SDSS星系合并目录，研究了星系合并和AGN核活动之间的联系。发现在约1011M⊙的恒星质量星系中，与非合并星系相比，合并星系中AGN的超额较强。进一步的研究发现，合并星系和AGN光度或吸积率之间没有相关性。总结：虽然总体上星系合并似乎会比非合并星系触发或增强AGN活动，但它们似乎并不会引起更高水平的吸积或更高的光度。我们为科学界提供MaNGA AGN目录和MaNGA星系合并目录。 <div>
To facilitate new studies of galaxy-merger-driven fueling of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we present a catalog of 387 AGNs that we have identified in the final population of over 10,000 z < 0.15 galaxies observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-IV (SDSS-IV) integral field spectroscopy survey Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA). We selected the AGNs via mid-infrared Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer colors, Swift/Burst Alert Telescope ultra-hard X-ray detections, NRAO Very Large Array Sky Survey and Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters radio observations, and broad emission lines in SDSS spectra. By combining the MaNGA AGN catalog with a new SDSS catalog of galaxy mergers that were identified based on a suite of hydrodynamical simulations of merging galaxies, we study the link between galaxy mergers and nuclear activity for AGNs above a limiting bolometric luminosity of 1044.4 erg s−1. We find an excess of AGNs in mergers, relative to nonmergers, for galaxies with stellar mass ∼1011M⊙, where the AGN excess is somewhat stronger in major mergers than in minor mergers. Further, when we combine minor and major mergers and sort by merger stage, we find that the highest AGN excess occurs in post-coalescence mergers in the highest-mass galaxies. However, we find no evidence of a correlation between galaxy mergers and AGN luminosity or accretion rate. In summary, while galaxy mergers overall do appear to trigger or enhance AGN activity more than nonmergers, they do not seem to induce higher levels of accretion or higher luminosities. We provide the MaNGA AGN Catalog and the MaNGA Galaxy Merger Catalog for the community here.

Gravitational wave (GW) standard siren observations provide a rather useful tool to explore the evolution of the Universe. In this work, we wish to investigate whether dark sirens with neutron star (NS) deformation from third-generation GW detectors could help probe the interaction between dark energy and dark matter. We simulate the GW dark sirens of four detection strategies based on 3 yr observation and consider four phenomenological interacting dark energy (IDE) models to perform cosmological analysis. We find that GW dark sirens could provide tight constraints on Ωm and H0 in the four IDE models but do not perform well in constraining the dimensionless coupling parameter β in models of the interaction proportional to the energy density of cold dark matter. Nevertheless, the parameter degeneracy orientations of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and GW are almost orthogonal, and thus, the combination of them could effectively break cosmological parameter degeneracies, with the constraint errors of β being 0.00068–0.018. In addition, we choose three typical equations of state (EoSs) of an NS, i.e., SLy, MPA1, and MS1, to investigate the effect of an NS’s EoS on cosmological analysis. The stiffer EoS could give tighter constraints than the softer EoS. Nonetheless, the combination of CMB and GW dark sirens (using different EoSs of an NS) shows basically the same constraint results of cosmological parameters. We conclude that the dark sirens from 3G GW detectors would play a crucial role in helping probe the interaction between dark energy and dark matter, and the CMB+GW results are basically not affected by the EoS of an NS.

We present a study of a sample of 45 spectroscopically confirmed, UV luminous galaxies at z ∼ 6. They were selected as bright Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) using deep multiband optical images in more than 2 deg2 of the sky, and subsequently identified via their strong Lyα emission. The majority of these LBGs span an absolute UV magnitude range from −22.0 to −20.5 mag with Lyα equivalent width (EW) between ∼10 and ∼200 Å, representing the most luminous galaxies at z ∼ 6 in terms of both UV continuum emission and Lyα line emission. We model the spectral energy distributions of 10 LBGs that have deep infrared observations from Hubble Space Telescope, JWST, and/or Spitzer, and find that they have a wide range of stellar masses and ages. They also have high star formation rates ranging from a few tens to a few hundreds of solar mass per year. Five of the LBGs have JWST or HST images, and four of them show compact morphology in these images, including one that is roughly consistent with a point source, suggesting that UV luminous galaxies at this redshift are generally compact. The fraction of our photometrically selected LBGs with strong Lyα emission (EW > 25 Å) is about 0.2, which is consistent with previous results and supports a moderate evolution of the intergalactic medium opacity at the end of cosmic reionization. Using deep X-ray images, we do not find evidence of strong active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity in these galaxies, but our constraint is loose, and we are not able to rule out the possibility of any weak AGN activity.

<title>Simple Model for Temporal Variations of Hα Spectrum by an Eruptive Filament from a Superflare on a Solar-type Star</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Flares are intense explosions on the solar and stellar surfaces, and solar flares are sometimes accompanied by filament or prominence eruptions. Recently, a large filament eruption associated with a superflare on a solar-type star EK Dra was discovered for the first time. The absorption of the Hα spectrum initially exhibited a blueshift with the velocity of 510 km s−1, and decelerated in time probably due to gravity. Stellar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) were thought to occur, although the filament eruption did not exceed the escape velocity under the surface gravity. To investigate how such a filament eruption can occur and whether CMEs are associated with the filament eruption or not, we perform a one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation of the flow along an expanding magnetic loop emulating a filament eruption under adiabatic and unsteady conditions. The loop configuration and expanding velocity normal to the loop are specified in the configuration parameters, and we calculate the line-of-sight velocity of the filament eruption using the velocities along and normal to the loop. We find that (i) the temporal variations of the Hα spectrum for EK Dra can be explained by a falling filament eruption in the loop with longer time and larger spatial scales than that of the Sun, and (ii) the stellar CMEs are also thought to be associated with the filament eruption from the superflare on EK Dra, because the rarefied loop unobserved in the Hα spectrum needs to expand faster than the escape velocity, whereas the observed filament eruption does not exceed the escape velocity.

<title>A Massive Quiescent Galaxy in a Group Environment at z = 4.53</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report on the spectroscopic confirmation of a massive quiescent galaxy at zspec = 4.53 in the COSMOS field. The object was first identified as a galaxy with suppressed star formation at zphot ∼ 4.65 from the COSMOS2020 catalog. The follow-up spectroscopy with Keck/MOSFIRE in the K band reveals faint [O ii] emission and the Balmer break, indicative of evolved stellar populations. We fit the spectral energy distribution using photometry and a spectrum to infer physical properties. The obtained stellar mass is high (M* ∼ 1010.8M⊙) and the current star formation rate is more than 1 dex below that of main-sequence galaxies at z = 4.5. Its star formation history suggests that this galaxy experienced rapid quenching from z ∼ 5. The galaxy is among the youngest quiescent galaxies confirmed so far at zspec > 3 with zform ∼ 5.2 (200 Myr ago), which is the epoch when 50% of the total stellar mass was formed. A unique aspect of the galaxy is that it is in an extremely dense region; there are four massive star-forming galaxies at 4.4 < zphot < 4.7 located within 150 physical kpc from the galaxy. Interestingly, three of them have virial radii that strongly overlap with that of the central quiescent galaxy (∼70 kpc), suggesting that the overdensity region is likely the highest-redshift candidate of a dense group with a spectroscopically confirmed quiescent galaxy at the center. The group provides us with a unique opportunity to gain insights into the role of the group environment in quenching at z ∼ 5, which corresponds to the formation epoch of massive elliptical galaxies in the local Universe.

<title>The Remarkable Predictive Power of Infrared Data of Blazars</title>

Blazars are the brightest and most abundant persistent sources in the extragalactic γ-ray sky. Due to their significance, they are often observed across various energy bands, where the data of which can be used to explore potential correlations between emission at different energies, yielding valuable insights into the emission processes of their powerful jets. In this study we utilized IR data at 3.4 and 4.6 μm from the Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer Reactivation Mission, spanning 8 yr of observations, X-ray data from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory collected throughout the satellite’s lifetime, and 12 years of γ-ray measurements from the Fermi Large Area Telescope’s all-sky survey. Our analysis reveals that the IR spectral slope reliably predicts the peak frequency and maximum intensity of the synchrotron component of blazar spectral energy distributions, provided it is uncontaminated by radiation unrelated to the jet. A notable correlation between the IR and γ-ray fluxes was observed, with the BL Lacertae subclass of blazars displaying a strong correlation coefficient of r = 0.80. IR band variability is more pronounced in flat spectrum radio quasars than in BL Lacertae objects, with mean fractional variability values of 0.65 and 0.35, respectively. We also observed that the synchrotron peak intensity of intermediate-high-energy-peaked objects can forecast their detectability at very high γ-ray energies. We used this predicting power to identify objects in current catalogs that could meet the detection threshold of the Cerenkov Telescope Array extragalactic survey, which should encompass approximately 180 blazars.

<title>Very High-energy (>50 GeV) Gamma-Ray Flux Variability of Bright Fermi Blazars</title>

Understanding the high-energy emission processes and variability patterns are two of the most challenging research problems associated with relativistic jets. In particular, the long-term (months to years) flux variability at very high energies (VHE >50 GeV) has remained an unexplored domain so far. This is possibly due to the decreased sensitivity of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) above a few GeV, hence low photon statistics, and observing constraints associated with the ground-based Cherenkov telescopes. This paper reports the results obtained from the 0.05−2 TeV Fermi-LAT data analysis of a sample of 29 blazars with the primary objective to explore their months-to-year-long very high-energy (VHE) flux variability behavior. This systematic search has led to, for the first time, the detection of significant flux variations in five blazars at the >99% confidence level, whereas eight of them exhibit variability, albeit at a lower confidence level (∼95%–99%). A comparison of the 0.05–2 TeV flux variations with that observed at 0.1–50 GeV band has revealed similar variability behavior for most of the sources. However, complex variability patterns that are not reflected contemporaneously in both energy bands were also detected, thereby providing tantalizing clues about the underlying radiative mechanisms. These results open up a new dimension to unravel the VHE emission processes operating in relativistic jets, hence sowing the seeds for their future observations with the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array.

<title>Radial Distribution of Electron Quasi-thermal Noise in the Outer Heliosphere</title>

Voyager 1 and 2 are only the two spacecraft that have arrived and passed through the heliospheric boundaries. Based on the plasma data from the Voyager 2 spacecraft, the electron quasi-thermal noise (QTN) is investigated by using of the electron population model consisting of a core with Maxwellian distribution and a halo with kappa distribution. The power spectra of the electron QTN is calculated at different heliocentric distances from 1 to 110 au. The parametric dependence of the QTN power spectra and the effective Debye length on the model parameters, such as the density ratio and temperature ratio of the halo to the core, kappa index and the antenna length, are discussed further. The results show that the electron QTN spectrum consists of a plateau in the low frequency band f < fpt, a prominent peak at the plasma frequency fpt, and a rapid decreasing part in the high frequency band f > fpt. The QTN plateau level basically falls down outwards until the termination shock crossing at about 84 au, after which the plateau rebounds a little near the heliopause. Although the model parameters can be very variable, the QTN plateau level does not present more than the double change in a fairly wide range of the model parameters. The presented results can be useful for future deep-space explorations in the heliosphere and can provide valuable references for the design of onboard detectors.

<title>Cosmic Reionization on Computers: Statistics, Physical Properties, and Environments of Lyman Limit Systems at z ∼ 6</title>

Lyman limit systems (LLSs) are dense hydrogen clouds with high enough H i column densities to absorb Lyman continuum photons emitted from distant quasars. Their high column densities imply an origin in dense environments; however, the statistics and distribution of LLSs at high redshifts still remain uncertain. In this paper, we use self-consistent radiative transfer cosmological simulations from the Cosmic Reionization on Computers (CROC) project to study the physical properties of LLSs at the tail end of cosmic reionization at z ∼ 6. We generate 3000 synthetic quasar sight lines to obtain a large number of LLS samples in the simulations. In addition, with the high physical fidelity and resolution of CROC, we are able to quantify the association between these LLS samples and nearby galaxies. Our results show that the fraction of LLSs spatially associated with nearby galaxies increases with H i column density. Moreover, we find that LLSs that are not near any galaxy typically reside in filamentary structures connecting neighboring galaxies in the intergalactic medium (IGM). This quantification of the distribution and association of LLSs to large-scale structure informs our understanding of the IGM–galaxy connection during the “Epoch of Reionization,” and provides a theoretical basis for interpreting future observations.

<title>COOL-LAMPS. VI. Lens Model and New Constraints on the Properties of COOL J1241+2219, a Bright z = 5 Lyman Break Galaxy and its z = 1 Cluster Lens</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a strong lensing analysis of COOL J1241+2219, the brightest known gravitationally lensed galaxy at z ≥ 5, based on new multiband Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging data. The lensed galaxy has a redshift of z = 5.043, placing it shortly after the end of the “Epoch of Reionization,” and an AB magnitude zAB = 20.47 mag (Khullar et al.). As such, it serves as a touchstone for future research of that epoch. The high spatial resolution of HST reveals internal structure in the giant arc, from which we identify 15 constraints and construct a robust lens model. We use the lens model to extract the cluster mass and lensing magnification. We find that the mass enclosed within the Einstein radius of the z = 1.001 cluster lens is , significantly lower than other known strong lensing clusters at its redshift. The average magnification of the giant arc is 〈μarc〉 = , a factor of greater than previously estimated from ground-based data; the flux-weighted average magnification is 〈μarc〉 = . We update the current measurements of the stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) of the source for the revised magnification to 9.7 ± 0.3 and SFR = M⊙ yr−1, respectively. The powerful lensing magnification acting upon COOL J1241+2219 resolves the source and enables future studies of the properties of its star formation on a clump-by-clump basis. The lensing analysis presented here will support upcoming multiwavelength characterization with HST and JWST data of the stellar mass assembly and physical properties of this high-redshift lensed galaxy.

<title>On the Possibility of an Upper Limit on Magnetically Induced Radius Inflation in Low-mass Stars</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad234e</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The radii of low-mass stars are observed to be inflated above standard model predictions, especially in magnetically active stars. Typically, the empirical relative radius inflations ΔR/R are ≤10% but in (rare) cases may be ≥20%. Our magneto-convective stellar models have already replicated many empirical ΔR/R values. Here, we ask: is there any theoretical upper limit on the amount of such inflation? We use our magneto-convective model to compute ΔR/R using empirically plausible values of the surface field strength parameter δ. Inside each model, the maximum internal field is set to a particular value: Bceil = 10, or 100 kG, or 1 MG. When Bceil = 10 kG, peak inflation with ΔR/R ≈ 90% occurs in stars with masses of 0.7 M⊙. With Bceil = 100 kG, peak inflation with ΔR/R ≈ 140% occurs in stars with M ≈ 0.5 M⊙. But with Bceil = 1 MG, we find no peak in ΔR/R as a function of δ; instead, the larger δ is, the larger ΔR/R becomes, reaching 300%–350% in the case of the largest δ considered. Thus, magneto-convective modeling can accommodate ΔR/R values which are considerably larger than any reported empirical inflations. We find that a maximum occurs in ΔR/R as a function of δ only in model stars where the field reaches its maximum strength Bceil inside the convective envelope. Moreover, our models of completely convective stars undergo smaller amounts of relative radius inflation than models with radiative cores, a result consistent with some previous reports.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present NICER observations of the accreting X-ray pulsar 1A 0535+262 during its faint state (≲6 × 1036 erg s−1), observed in several type I and type II outbursts. We discovered a transition of temporal and spectral properties around the luminosity Lt = 3.3 × 1035 erg s−1, below which spectra are relatively soft and the pulse profiles have only a narrow peak. The spectra are harder and a secondary hump gradually appears in the pulse profiles when L ≳ Lt. We discuss possible physical mechanisms for this transition, including different Comptonization seed photons, the disappearance of gas shocks on the neutron star surface, and the combination of plasma and vacuum polarization effects.

<br /><br />
研究热木星的大气动力学时，了解全球环流和化学之间的相互作用非常重要。本文介绍了二维光化学运输模型VULCAN 2D，该模型通过允许非均匀纬向风改进了伪二维方法。我们对VULCAN 2D进行了广泛的验证，并应用到HD 189733 b和HD 209458 b，揭示了混合机制的转变。针对先前推断的富碳大气，我们发现超太阳C/O比的HD 209458 b在早晨边缘呈现出明显的C2H4吸收，而在晚上边缘则没有，这归因于来自夜侧的水平运输。最后，我们用合成光谱展示了水平运输在透射观测中的影响及其对晨晚边缘不对称性的影响，强调在解释外行星大气时考虑全球运输的必要性。 
<br /><br />总结: 这篇文章介绍了VULCAN 2D模型，并讨论了热木星的大气动力学以及其对化学的影响。研究发现水平运输在下层主导，而在高空垂直混合更为重要。针对HD 209458 b的观测发现，考虑全球运输对解释大气现象非常重要。 <div>
The atmospheric dynamics of tidally locked hot Jupiters is characterized by strong equatorial winds. Understanding the interaction between global circulation and chemistry is crucial in atmospheric studies and interpreting observations. Two-dimensional (2D) photochemical transport models shed light on how the atmospheric composition depends on circulation. In this paper, we introduce the 2D photochemical (horizontal and vertical) transport model, VULCAN 2D, which improves on the pseudo-2D approaches by allowing for nonuniform zonal winds. We extensively validate our VULCAN 2D with analytical solutions and benchmark comparisons. Applications to HD 189733 b and HD 209458 b reveal a transition in mixing regimes: horizontal transport predominates below ∼0.1 mbar, while vertical mixing is more important at higher altitudes above 0.1 mbar. Motivated by the previously inferred carbon-rich atmosphere, we find that HD 209458 b with supersolar carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) exhibits pronounced C2H4 absorption on the morning limb but not on the evening limb, due to horizontal transport from the nightside. We discuss when a pseudo-2D approach is a valid assumption and its inherent limitations. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of horizontal transport in transmission observations and its impact on the morning−evening limb asymmetry with synthetic spectra, highlighting the need to consider global transport when interpreting exoplanet atmospheres.

<div> 关键词: 太阳耀斑，光谱线，大气层，辐射传递，速度场

总结: 太阳耀斑期间，光谱线的形成受到上层区域的影响，表现出复合的出射强度曲线。通过辐射-流体动力学和辐射传递计算模拟了太阳/恒星大气对电子束加热的响应，合成了铁离子的光谱线并研究了通过多普勒频移得到的视线速度场信息。研究发现，光谱线变化主要由色球层的变化引起，该区域的上升气流能够在线心产生蓝移或伪红移，取决于与光球层相比的相对贡献。在极端太阳和恒星耀斑情景中，爆炸性的色球凝结物也可以主导轮廓形状的暂时性红移，需要考虑三元分量才能完全表征。因此，深层形成的光谱线需要多组分的理解和处理，光谱线的不同区域对大气速度流动的探测都是有用的。 <div>
During solar flares, spectral lines formed in the photosphere have been shown to exhibit changes to their profiles despite the challenges of energy transfer to these depths. Recent work has shown that deep-forming spectral lines are subject to significant contributions from regions above the photosphere throughout the flaring period, resulting in a composite emergent intensity profile from multiple layers of the atmosphere. We employ radiative–hydrodynamic and radiative transfer calculations to simulate the response of the solar/stellar atmosphere to electron beam heating and synthesize spectral lines of Fe i to investigate the line-of-sight velocity fields information available from Doppler shifts of the emergent intensity profile. By utilizing the contribution function to deconstruct the line profile shape into its constituent sources, we show that variations in the line profiles are primarily caused by changes in the chromosphere. Up-flows in this region were found to create blueshifts or false redshifts in the line core dependent on the relative contribution of the chromosphere compared to the photosphere. In extreme solar and stellar flare scenarios featuring explosive chromospheric condensations, redshifted transient components can dominate the temporal evolution of the profile shape, requiring a tertiary component consideration to fully characterize. We conclude that deep-forming lines require a multicomponent understanding and treatment, with different regions of the spectral line being useful for probing individual regions of the atmosphere’s velocity flows.

总结:
本文研究了太阳星云中尘埃颗粒的长期存活条件，发现在弱湍流、平坦径向压力梯度和高金属含量的条件下（α∼10−6, η≲10−3, Z∼0.1），直径为1毫米的尘埃颗粒可以在太阳星云中存活并保持其大小超过106年。这与最近的观测结果相符。最后，文章提出行星体形成可能是由盘片演化引起的，例如由于盘片风的内向扩散导致。 <div>
The lifetime of millimeter-sized dust grains, such as chondrules, in the nominal solar nebula model is limited to ∼105 yr, due to an inward drift driven by gas drag. However, isotopic and petrological studies of primitive meteorites indicate a discrepancy of ≳106 yr between the formation time of chondrules and that of chondritic parent bodies. Therefore, chondrules should survive for ≳106 yr in the solar nebula against the inward drift without subsequent growth (i.e., planetesimal formation). Here, we investigate the conditions of the solar nebula that are suitable for the long lifetime of chondrule-sized dust particles. We take the turbulent strength, the radial pressure gradient force, and the disk metallicity of the solar nebula as free parameters. For 1 mm radius chondrules to survive and keep their size for ≳106 yr, the suitable condition is a weak turbulence (α ∼ 10−6), a flat radial profile (η ≲ 10−3), and a high metallicity (Z ∼ 0.1). This condition is qualitatively consistent with the characteristics of protoplanetary disks suggested by recent observations. We eventually propose that planetesimal formation may be induced by disk evolution, e.g., the inside-out dispersal of the gas component due to the disk wind.

Iron Kα (Fe Kα) emission is observed ubiquitously in active galactic nuclei (AGN), and it is a powerful probe of their circumnuclear environment. Examinations of the emission line play a pivotal role in understanding the disk geometry surrounding black holes. It has been suggested that the torus and the broad-line region (BLR) are the origins of emission. However, there is no universal location for the emitting region relative to the BLR. Here, we present an analysis of the narrow component of the Fe Kα line in the Seyfert AGN MCG-5-23-16, one of the brightest AGN in X-rays and in Fe Kα emission, to localize the emitting region. Spectra derived from Chandra/HETGS observations show asymmetry in the narrow Fe Kα line, which has only been confirmed before in the AGN NGC 4151. Models including relativistic Doppler broadening and gravitational redshifts are preferred over simple Gaussians and measure radii consistent with R ≃ 200–650 rg. These results are consistent with those of NGC 4151 and indicate that the narrow Fe Kα line in MCG-5-23-16 is primarily excited in the innermost part of the optical BLR, or X-ray BLR. Characterizing the properties of the narrow Fe Kα line is essential for studying the disk geometries of the AGN population and mapping their innermost regions.

合并星系UGC 5205是一个在低红移处很罕见的沉寂型低质量星系。虽然具有丰富的冷气体和紫外线发射，表明在过去的几亿年内有显著的星形成活动，但是最近∼10百万年内却没有探测到Hα发射-星的形成。新的Karl G.Jansky超大阵观测显示，UGC 5205星系中主体的H i非常扰动，大部分H i存在于几千秒差距长的尾部，而PGC 027864的H i受有序旋转的影响。研究对UGC 5205的恒星群进行建模表明，一致的UV和Hα发射表明，星系约100-300百万年前经历了一个协调的淬火事件。UGC 5205和PGC 027864的不对称结果表明，主要的合并事件既可以淬火也可以触发矮星的形成。然而，由于气体仍然与系统结合，我们建议这样的合并仅暂时淬火星形成。我们估计UGC 5205的总淬火时间约为∼560百万年，与研究已建立的矮星体淬火部分的上限约为几个百分比一致。<br /><br />总结:合并星系UGC 5205具有丰富的冷气体和紫外线发射，但最近的Hα发射显示其星形成被淬火。通过H i观测发现，UGC 5205缺乏H i，而PGC 027864具有有序旋转的H i。研究模拟表明UGC 5205的淬火事件约为100-300百万年前发生，暗示主要合并事件会暂时淬火星形成。 <div>
It is exceedingly rare to find quiescent low-mass galaxies in the field at low redshift. UGC 5205 is an example of such a quenched field dwarf (M⋆ ∼ 3 × 108 M⊙). Despite a wealth of cold gas (MHI ∼ 3.5 × 108 M⊙) and UV emission that indicates significant star formation in the past few hundred megayears, there is no detection of Hα emission—star formation in the last ∼10 Myr—across the face of the galaxy. Meanwhile, the near equal-mass companion of UGC 5205, PGC 027864, is starbursting (which has an Hα equivalent width > 1000 Å). In this work, we present new Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array 21 cm line observations of UGC 5205, showing that the lack of star formation is caused by an absence of H i in the main body of the galaxy. The H i of UGC 5205 is highly disturbed; the bulk of the H i resides in several-kiloparsec–long tails, while the H i of PGC 027864 is dominated by ordered rotation. We model the stellar populations of UGC 5205 to show that, as indicated by the UV and Hα emission, the galaxy underwent a coordinated quenching event ∼100–300 Myr ago. The asymmetry of outcomes for UGC 5205 and PGC 027864 demonstrate that major mergers can both quench and trigger star formation in dwarfs. However, because the gas remains bound to the system, we suggest that such mergers only temporarily quench star formation. We estimate a total quenched time of ∼560 Myr for UGC 5205, consistent with established upper limits on the quenched fraction of a few percent for dwarfs in the field.

Using an idealized climate model incorporating seasonal forcing, we investigate the impact of rotation rate on the abundance of clouds on an Earth-like aquaplanet, and the resulting impacts upon albedo and seasonality. We show that the cloud distribution varies significantly with season, depending strongly on the rotation rate, and is well explained by the large-scale circulation and atmospheric state. Planetary albedo displays nonmonotonic behavior with rotation rate, peaking at around 1/2ΩE. Clouds reduce the surface temperature and total precipitation relative to simulations without clouds at all rotation rates, and reduce the dependence of total precipitation on rotation rate, causing nonmonotonic behavior and a local maximum around 1/8ΩE; these effects are related to the impacts of clouds on the net atmospheric and surface radiative energy budgets. Clouds also affect the seasonality. The influence of clouds on the extent of the winter Hadley cell and the intertropical convergence zone is relatively minor at slow rotation rates (<1/8ΩE), but becomes more pronounced at intermediate rotation rates, where clouds decrease their maximum latitudes. The timing of seasonal transitions varies with rotation rate, and the addition of clouds reduces the seasonal phase lag.

<title>Influence of Ionization on the Polytropic Index of the Solar Atmosphere within Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium Approximation</title>

<div> 关键词: polytropic index, solar corona, LTE, ionization-recombination, plasma cocktail
总结:
本文通过理论模拟解决了观测到的太阳日冕多普勒/绝热指数γ下降的现象。研究发现，在含有重元素的太阳等离子体混合物中，离子化-复合反应的化学过程在局部热力学平衡(LTE)状态下导致了1.1<γ≤5/3。通过数值求解Saha方程并利用新推导的方程计算多普勒指数，得出了该结果。此外，观测到的缓慢磁流体波在日冕环中的传播速度与LTE离子化仅占观测到的γ下降的一小部分，这意味着太阳活跃区的等离子体并未处于预期的LTE状态。然而，当前的理论方法证实了温度升高时更高的多普勒指数的依赖性。综上所述，为了解释太阳日冕活跃区内多普勒指数的下降，有必要进行动力学非LTE离子化计算。 <div>
An initial theoretical attempt to explain the observed decrease of the polytropic/adiabatic index γ in the solar corona has been accomplished. The chemical reactions of the ionization–recombination processes in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) of a solar plasma cocktail containing heavy elements are found to cause 1.1 < γ ≤ 5/3 in the quiet solar atmosphere. It is also shown that the quiet solar atmosphere is in LTE, justifying this theoretical study. This result is obtained by numerically solving the Saha equation and subsequently using a newly derived equation for calculation of the polytropic index from thermodynamic partial derivatives of the enthalpy and pressure with respect to density and temperature. In addition, a comparison measured from spectroscopic observations of propagating slow magnetohydrodynamic waves in coronal loops shows that LTE ionization accounts for a very small part of the observed decrease of γ, meaning that the solar plasma in the active region is not in LTE as expected. However, the observed dependency of higher polytropic index at higher temperatures is confirmed by the current theoretical approach. It is concluded that in order to account for the polytropic index decrease in the active regions of the solar corona, it is necessary for kinetic non-LTE ionization calculations to be performed.

<div> M dwarfs, tidal dissipation, planetary orbits, resonance locking, orbital migration
<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了低质量M型矮星的潮汐耗散对短周期太阳系外行星系统轨道结构的影响。通过非摄动谱方法计算了完全对流M型矮星的正常模式振荡，并计算了每种模式的耗散潮汐响应。研究发现非绝热耦合是耗散计算的重要组成部分。根据耗散结果，对潮汐在宿主恒星中的影响进行了计算。研究发现共面行星轨道因共振锁定而发生轨道迁移，影响周期小于1.5天的地球质量行星和周期小于2.5天的木星质量行星的轨道。由于共振驱动的轨道衰减和外移，预测在周期约1天内缺乏小行星，同时周期约3天内更大行星数量也很稀少。 <div>
The orbital architectures of short-period exoplanet systems are shaped by tidal dissipation in their host stars. For low-mass M dwarfs whose dynamical tidal response comprises a dense spectrum of inertial modes at low frequencies, resolving the frequency dependence of tidal dissipation is crucial to capturing the effect of tides on planetary orbits throughout the evolutionary stages of the host star. We use nonperturbative spectral methods to calculate the normal mode oscillations of a fully convective M dwarf modeled using realistic stellar profiles from MESA. We compute the dissipative tidal response composed of contributions from each mode, as well as nonadiabatic coupling between the modes, which we find to be an essential component of the dissipative calculations. Using our results for dissipation, we then compute the evolution of circular, coplanar planetary orbits under the influence of tides in the host star. We find that orbital migration driven by resonance locking affects the orbits of Earth-mass planets at orbital periods Porb ≲ 1.5 days and of Jupiter-mass planets at Porb ≲ 2.5 days. Due to resonantly driven orbital decay and outward migration, we predict a dearth of small planets closer than Porb ∼ 1 day and similarly sparse numbers of more massive planets out to Porb ∼ 3 days.

总结:
本文开发了一个分析模型，用于描述初代星在原始气云中心形成的质量，作为宿主暗物质晕质量、红移和旋转程度的函数。模型基于对三个过程关键时间尺度的估计：气云坍缩、原恒星核吸积和原恒星核辐射反馈。最终的恒星质量取决于直到辐射反馈停止吸积的总吸积质量。这种分析估计出于全数值模拟的结果，导出了代数表达式，执行速度极快。尽管简单，该模型复制了观察到的最新宇宙学放大模拟中的恒星质量尺度和其参数依赖关系。这项工作阐明了支撑这种数值处理的基本物理原理，并为高效调整数值预测以符合最终观测到的初代星提供了途径。 <div>
We develop an analytic model for the mass of the first stars forming in the centers of primordial gas clouds as a function of host halo mass, redshift, and degree of rotation. The model is based on the estimation of key timescales determining the following three processes: the collapse of the gas cloud, the accretion onto the protostellar core, and the radiative feedback of the protostellar core. The final stellar mass is determined by the total mass accreted until the radiative feedback halts the accretion. The analytic estimation, motivated by the result of the full numerical simulations, leads to algebraic expressions allowing an extremely fast execution. Despite its simplicity, the model reproduces the stellar mass scale and its parameter dependencies observed in state-of-the-art cosmological zoom-in simulations. This work clarifies the basic physical principles undergirding such numerical treatments and provides a path to efficiently calibrating numerical predictions against eventual observations of the first stars.

<div> 观测、JWST/NIRCam slitless grism spectroscopy、Mg II absorption、星系、再电离

在这项研究中，研究人员利用深度的JWST/NIRCam slitless grism spectroscopy观测了29个星系周围冷弥散气体的新现象，这些星系的红移在2.3到6.3之间。它们的质量跨度很大，并且具有SFR/M⊙ yr−1 < 2.3的星形成率。研究发现，在距离类星体J0100+2802的视线附近300 kpc处有七个Mg II吸收系统。Mg II径向吸收剖面随半径急剧下降，大部分吸收延伸至宿主星系的2-3倍R200。其中六个Mg II吸收系统与质量为9的星系相关。Mg II吸收的动力学偏移与宿主星系的系统红移不同，其中位动速度约为135 km/s，标准偏差约为85 km/s。未绑定到宿主星系的Mg II吸收系统数量较高，表明在再电离末期，星系的晕层处于显著失衡状态，并且在丰富星系间介质方面非常高效。最强的两个Mg II吸收系统分别在z∼4.22和4.5处检测到，前者与一个合并的星系系统相关，后者与三个动力学接近的星系相关。这些星系都位于局部星系密集区，表明在z>4时存在两个“原星系团”中的冷Mg II吸收。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究利用JWST/NIRCam slitless grism spectroscopy观测了29个星系周围的冷弥散气体，发现其中七个Mg II吸收系统。这些吸收系统显示出高动力学偏移和大径向分离，表明大部分Mg II气体与其宿主星系不是通过引力约束在一起的。此外，两个最强的Mg II吸收系统出现在星系合并和星系密集区，暗示着在z>4时存在原星系团。 <div>
We report new observations of the cool diffuse gas around 29, 2.3 < z < 6.3 galaxies using deep JWST/NIRCam slitless grism spectroscopy around the sight line to the quasar J0100+2802. The galaxies span a stellar mass range of , and star formation rates (SFRs) of SFR/M⊙ yr−1 < 2.3. We find galaxies for seven Mg ii absorption systems within 300 kpc of the quasar sight line. The Mg ii radial absorption profile falls off sharply with radius, with most of the absorption extending out to 2–3 R200 of the host galaxies. Six out of seven Mg ii absorption systems are detected around galaxies with 9. The Mg ii absorption kinematics are shifted from the systemic redshifts of host galaxies with a median absolute velocity ≈ 135 km s−1 and standard deviation ≈ 85 km s−1. The high kinematic offset and large radial separation (R > 1.3 R200), suggest that five out of the seven Mg ii absorption systems are not gravitationally bound to their host galaxy. In contrast, most of the cool circumgalactic medium at z < 1 is gravitationally bound. The high incidence of unbound Mg ii gas in this work suggests that toward the end of reionization, galaxy halos are in a state of remarkable disequilibrium, and are highly efficient in enriching the intergalactic medium. The two strongest Mg ii absorption systems are detected at z ∼ 4.22 and 4.5, the former associated with a merging galaxy system and the latter associated with three kinematically close galaxies. Both of these galaxies reside in local galaxy overdensities, indicating the presence of cool Mg ii absorption in two “protogroups” at z > 4.

总结:<br />
这篇文章研究了Taurus分子云中最近检测到的1-和2-氰基萘和氰基苯的真空紫外光动力学。通过合并同步辐射和双成像电子/离子的巧合实验装置，实验得到了所有三种分子的高分辨率阈电子光谱，从中汇报了绝对精度很高的绝热电离能，特别是对于2-氰基萘，这是在这个精度水平上没有数据的。理论计算用于比较离子的基态的阈电子光谱。此外，通过外价格林函数计算，已经将扩展的阈电子光谱中观察到的不同特征分配给不同的分子轨道。该研究还阐明了光电子的动能分布，以描述它们对星际介质中的光电加热效应的贡献。最后，通过估计总离子产额，我们估算了几种星际辐射场的光速率。最后，我们讨论了两种氰基萘的光解离，借助Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus建模报告了解离通道的活化能。观察到CN取代对VUV解离光电离弛豫通道没有引起任何明显变化。 <div>
We investigate the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photodynamics of gas phase 1- and 2-cyanonaphthalene and cyanobenzene, recently detected in the Taurus molecular cloud, by combining synchrotron radiation and a double imaging electron/ion coincidence setup. The high-resolution threshold photoelectron spectra (TPES) of all three molecules are obtained experimentally from which the adiabatic ionization energies are reported with very high accuracy, particularly for 2-cyanonaphthalene, for which no data exist at this level of precision. Theoretical calculations are performed to compare with the TPES for the ground electronic state of the cations. Furthermore, the different features observed in the extended TPES have been assigned to the different molecular orbitals with the help of the outer valence Green's function calculations. The present experiments also shed light on the kinetic energy distribution of the photoelectrons as a function of the incident photon energy, to describe their contribution to the photoelectric heating effect in the interstellar medium. In this context, we show how kinetic energy distributions can be obtained from our data for any given photon energy, such as the omnipresent Lyα line, or any given interstellar radiation field (ISRF). In addition, from the total ion yields, we estimate the photorates for a few ISRFs. Finally, we discuss the photodissociation of the two cyanonaphthalenes, quoting the activation energies of the dissociation channels with the help of Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus modeling. It is observed that CN substitution does not cause any appreciable change to the VUV dissociative photoionization relaxation channel.

<br /><br />总结:
本文报道了对J0354−1340的新的VLBA和GMRT观测结果。这是唯一已知具有100 kpc双边射电喷流的无射电安静或射电中间的窄线塞弗特1星系。VLBA观测发现了源区域向东南方向的解析尺度单边射流，并且在Karl G. Jansky大型阵列和GMRT的观测中发现了以南北方向延伸的千秒差观。通过与3.0 GHz的存档VLA Sky Survey观测和5.5 GHz的VLA C配置观测相结合，呈现了解析尺度和千秒尺度上的核心谱。在∼5 GHz以上，解析尺度辐射主导了千秒尺度辐射，并且由于同步辐射自吸收而呈现出谱线倒转。这表明了一个尺度约为∼0.04 pc的紧凑同步辐射源，与射流基底或日冕相关。在3″尺度上未解决的千秒尺度射流可能在∼5 GHz以下主导了辐射。未来的射电观测可以探索解析尺度和100 kpc尺度之间的射流结构，其方向不匹配的起源以及解析尺度射流的适当运动。尚待探讨射电安静或射电中间活跃星系中这类大尺度射流的普遍性。 <div>
We present new 1.5–8.5 GHz Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations and 0.32–1.26 GHz Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) observations of J0354−1340, which is the only known radio-quiet (RQ) or radio-intermediate (RI) narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy with a 100 kpc, two-sided radio jet. A parsec-scale, one-sided jet in the southeastern direction from the core emission is found in the VLBA observations, while the kiloparsec-scale jet observed with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and GMRT is in the south–north direction. Core spectra on parsec and kiloparsec scales are presented in combination with archival VLA Sky Survey observations at 3.0 GHz and VLA C-configuration observations at 5.5 GHz. The parsec-scale emission dominates the kiloparsec-scale emission above ∼5 GHz, and the spectrum is inverted due to synchrotron self-absorption. This indicates a compact synchrotron source with a size of ∼0.04 pc, which is associated with either the jet base or the corona. A subkiloparsec-scale jet, which is unresolved on scales of ∼3″, probably dominates the emission below ∼5 GHz. Future radio observations can explore the jet structure between the parsec and 100 kpc scales, the origin of their direction mismatch, and the parsec-scale jet proper motion. It remains to be explored how common such large-scale jets are in RQ or RI active galactic nuclei.

<div> 红移空间观测，平行平面逼近，条件矩（cmd），一阶导数的条件矩，红移空间畸变参数β，高斯线性Kaiser极限，非高斯性，Fisher预测<br /><br />总结: 本文介绍了一种新的平滑物质密度场的条件矩测度方法，可以有效地约束红移空间畸变参数β = f/b，尤其在高斯线性Kaiser极限条件下。通过使用条件矩（cmd）和条件重心（cr）联合，可以显著提高对宇宙学参数Ωm、σ8和ns的约束能力。文章还讨论了非高斯性对红移空间的影响，以及对模拟数据的一阶非高斯性贡献的影响。 通过合成各向异性高斯场的实现，验证了理论与数值结果的一致性。 <div>
Focusing on the redshift space observations with plane-parallel approximation and relying on the rotational dependency of the general definition of excursion sets, we introduce the so-called conditional moments of the first derivative (cmd) measures for the smoothed matter density field in three dimensions. We derive the perturbative expansion of cmd for the real space and redshift space where peculiar velocity disturbs the galaxies’ observed locations. Our criteria can successfully recognize the contribution of linear Kaiser and Finger-of-God effects. Our results demonstrate that the cmd measure has significant sensitivity for pristine constraining the redshift space distortion parameter β = f/b and interestingly, the associated normalized quantity in the Gaussian linear Kaiser limit has only β dependency. Implementation of the synthetic anisotropic Gaussian field approves the consistency between the theoretical and numerical results. Including the first-order contribution of non-Gaussianity perturbatively in the cmd criterion implies that the N-body simulations for the Quijote suite in the redshift space have been mildly skewed with a higher value for the threshold greater than zero. The non-Gaussianity for the perpendicular direction to the line of sight in the redshift space for smoothing scales R ≳ 20 Mpc h−1 is almost the same as in the real space. In contrast, the non-Gaussianity along the line-of-sight direction in the redshift space is magnified. The Fisher forecasts indicate a significant enhancement in constraining the cosmological parameters Ωm, σ8, and ns when using cmd + cr jointly.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了两次伴有紫外线后期相的X级太阳耀斑对电离层电流和赤道电动机的影响。研究发现，耀斑的冲击相能显著增强电离层电流，在2012年10月23日的X1.8级耀斑事件中，太阳风压力也影响了电流模式。而在2014年4月25日的X1.3级耀斑事件中，虽然太阳风压力较弱并稳定，但电流依然显著增强。同时，研究还发现，即使太阳风动态压力发生微弱变化，只有大约2nPa的变化也可能对全球电离层电流系统产生明显影响。 <div>
It is known that solar flares can affect the current system of the middle- and low-latitude ionosphere. Most earlier studies have focused on such effects during their impulsive phases. Recent studies have reported flares with a significant extreme ultraviolet (EUV) late phase, the effects of which on ionospheric currents have not yet been investigated. Here, we examine the solar quiet (Sq) currents and equatorial electrojets during two X-class flares with EUV late phases using data from more than 200 ground magnetometers. Our results indicate that the ionospheric currents could be significantly enhanced during the impulsive phase, while the effects of the EUV late phase may increase the global ionospheric currents, but are often weak and thus could be obscured by a change in solar wind conditions. In the X1.8 flare event on 2012 October 23, besides the solar flare effects, the currents were modulated by solar wind pressure. In the X1.3 flare event on 2014 April 25, the solar wind pressure was weak and stable, and the Sq currents were enhanced compared to nonflare conditions. We also found that even weak changes in the solar wind dynamic pressure, with magnitudes as low as ∼2 nPa, which are often ignored, may have an appreciable impact on the global ionospheric current system.

In this study, we treat Earth as an exoplanet and investigate our home planet by means of a potential future mid-infrared space mission called the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE). We combine thermal spectra from an empirical data set of disk-integrated Earth observations with a noise model for LIFE to create mock observations. We apply a state-of-the-art atmospheric retrieval framework to characterize the planet, assess the potential for detecting the known bioindicators, and investigate the impact of viewing geometry and seasonality on the characterization. Our key findings reveal that we are observing a temperate habitable planet with significant abundances of CO2, H2O, O3, and CH4. Seasonal variations in the surface and equilibrium temperature, as well as in the Bond albedo, are detectable. Furthermore, the viewing geometry and the spatially and temporally unresolved nature of our observations only have a minor impact on the characterization. Additionally, Earth’s variable abundance profiles and patchy cloud coverage can bias retrieval results for the atmospheric structure and trace-gas abundances. Lastly, the limited extent of Earth’s seasonal variations in biosignature abundances makes the direct detection of its biosphere through atmospheric seasonality unlikely. Our results suggest that LIFE could correctly identify Earth as a planet where life could thrive, with detectable levels of bioindicators, a temperate climate, and surface conditions allowing liquid surface water. Even if atmospheric seasonality is not easily observed, our study demonstrates that next generation space missions can assess whether nearby temperate terrestrial exoplanets are habitable or even inhabited.

通过对8000多个Sloan数字天文巡天DR7活动星系核（AGNs）的Hβ和Hα宽发射线的红移以及线宽进行测量，假设由中心超大质量黑洞产生的引力红移，并基于引力红移和发射线红移，我们测量了在确定超级质量黑洞质量中的维里系数。通常被认为维里系数与广线区域（BLR）中气体云对吸积辐射压力无关，仅仅与BLR的偏移效应有关。测量得到的维里系数跨度极大。在我们的样本中，绝大多数AGNs（>96％）的维里系数大于文献中通常使用的f = 1。f-修正使高吸积AGNs的百分比减少了大约100倍。f与无量纲吸积率和艾登顿比率呈正相关。Hβ和Hα的红移主要是由引力原因造成的，通过BLR的无量纲半径与红移的负相关确认了这一点。我们的研究结果表明，辐射压力力对所测维里系数的贡献是显著的，并且包含了BLR的偏移效应。需要对高吸积AGNs进行f-修正，特别是高红移类星体。f-修正将使它们的质量增加1-2个数量级，这将使在高红移处形成和增长超大质量黑洞的解释变得更加具有挑战性。<br /><br />总结: Sloan Digital Sky Survey, active galactic nuclei, virial factor, gravitational redshift, supermassive black hole <div>
Under the hypothesis of gravitational redshift induced by the central supermassive black hole and based on line widths and shifts of redward-shifted Hβ and Hα broad emission lines for more than 8000 Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7 active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we measure the virial factor in determining supermassive black hole masses. The virial factor had been believed to be independent of accretion radiation pressure on gas clouds in broad-line regions (BLRs) and only dependent on the inclination effects of BLRs. The virial factor measured spans a very large range. For the vast majority of AGNs (>96%) in our samples, the virial factor is larger than the f = 1 usually used in the literature. The f-correction makes the percent of high-accreting AGNs decrease by about 100 times. There are positive correlations of f with the dimensionless accretion rate and Eddington ratio. The redward shifts of Hβ and Hα are mainly of gravitational origin, confirmed by a negative correlation between the redward shift and the dimensionless radius of the BLR. Our results show that radiation pressure force is a significant contributor to the measured virial factor, containing the inclination effects of the BLR. The usually used values of f should be corrected for high-accreting AGNs, especially high-redshift quasars. The f-correction increases their masses by 1–2 orders of magnitude, which will make it more challenging to explain the formation and growth of supermassive black holes at high redshifts.

总结:
研究了一系列轴对称旋转磁风解决方案，旨在探讨具有强磁场、快速自转和强烈质量丢失特征的大质量白矮星（WD）合并遗迹的观测性质，这与WD J005311的推断性质相吻合。我们研究了磁层结构及对合并遗迹施加的自旋减速力矩与表面磁通Φ*、自旋角频率Ω*和质量丢失率的关系。我们确认，这种旋转磁性风序列的风特性与球形帕克风的显著偏离，其中vesc是恒星表面的逃逸速度。对于这样一个旋转磁性风序列，我们发现（i）磁重连沿赤道平面触发的准周期性质量喷发以及（ii）自旋减速力矩的比例关系。我们应用我们的结果来讨论大质量WD合并遗迹的自旋减速演化和风吹向对称性，后者可以通过使用Chandra连续观测WD J005311来探索。 <div>
We numerically construct a series of axisymmetric rotating magnetic wind solutions, aiming at exploring the observation properties of massive white dwarf (WD) merger remnants with a strong magnetic field, a fast spin, and an intense mass loss, as inferred for WD J005311. We investigate the magnetospheric structure and the resultant spin-down torque exerted to the merger remnant with respect to the surface magnetic flux Φ*, spin angular frequency Ω* and the mass-loss rate . We confirm that the wind properties for significantly deviate from those of the spherical Parker wind, where vesc is the escape velocity at stellar surface. For such a rotating magnetic wind sequence, we find (i) a quasiperiodic mass eruption triggered by magnetic reconnection along with the equatorial plane and (ii) a scaling relation for the spin-down torque . We apply our results to discuss the spin-down evolution and wind anisotropy of massive WD merger remnants, the latter of which could be probed by a successive observation of WD J005311 using Chandra.

<div> Faraday rotation, magnetic field, plasma, remote sensing, Appleton-Hartree equation
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了一种用于远程估计等离子体磁场的方法，通过修改测量技术，实现了对垂直于传播路径的磁场向量的远程检测。利用Appleton-Hartree方程验证了新的计算相位变化的方法，并对垂直传播模式的整合路径效应进行了计算。文章还展示了如何消除磁场对电子总含量测量的影响，并通过双频波的方法隔离了磁场项。最后，结合法拉第旋转，减少了磁场向量方向的重复性。 <div>
The one consistent technique for remotely estimating the magnetic field in plasma has been Faraday rotation. It is only sensitive to the portion of the vector parallel to the propagation path. We show how to remotely detect the portion of the vector that is perpendicular using a modified measurement. Isolating this electromagnetic propagation wave mode to measure the magnetic field enables us to (i) study more about the magnetic field vector in plasma, (ii) reduce error in total electron content measurements, and (iii) discover new magnetic field information from archived data sets. The Appleton–Hartree equation is used to verify a new approach to calculating the phase change to an electromagnetic wave propagating through a plasma at frequencies larger than the gyrofrequency, the cyclotron frequency, and the upper hybrid frequency. Focusing on the perpendicular propagation modes, the simplified equation for the integrated path effect from a perpendicular magnetic field is calculated. The direction of the perpendicular component is unknown, because the magnetic field is squared. Isolating the magnetic term in the equation with dual frequency waves is shown. We also show how to eliminate the magnetic field contribution to total electron content measurements with a similar approach. In combination with Faraday rotation, the degeneracy of the magnetic field vector direction is reduced to a cone configuration.

CHIME 和 eBOSS 的数据交叉核对发现了21厘米的辐射信号，这是迄今为止观测到的最高红移的21厘米辐射。CHIME在88天内收集了400-500 MHz频带（1.8 < z < 2.5）的数据，并将其制成天空图并进行了高通滤波。通过将eBOSS背景类星体位置的CHIME数据与Lyα森林流量透过谱结合起来，估算了21厘米-Lyα交叉相关函数，并通过拟合模拟产生的模板函数，得到了9σ的检测显著性。尽管前景残留物的超额方差约为预期热噪声水平的6-10倍，但信号的一致累积使得即使存在这些干扰，也足以实现检测。这些结果为未来的21厘米强度映射分析在z > 1.8时提供了基础。 <br /><br />总结: CHIME和eBOSS的数据交叉核对发现了21厘米的辐射信号，这是迄今为止观测到的最高红移的21厘米辐射。检测结果通过对21厘米-Lyα交叉相关函数进行拟合模拟函数，达到了9σ的检测显著性。即使前景残留物的超额方差约为预期热噪声水平的6-10倍，信号的一致累积使得即使存在这些干扰，也足以实现检测。这为未来的21厘米强度映射分析提供了基础。 <div>
We report the detection of 21 cm emission at an average redshift in the cross-correlation of data from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) with measurements of the Lyα forest from eBOSS. Data collected by CHIME over 88 days in the 400–500 MHz frequency band (1.8 < z < 2.5) are formed into maps of the sky and high-pass delay filtered to suppress the foreground power, corresponding to removing cosmological scales with k∥ ≲ 0.13 Mpc−1 at the average redshift. Line-of-sight spectra to the eBOSS background quasar locations are extracted from the CHIME maps and combined with the Lyα forest flux transmission spectra to estimate the 21 cm–Lyα cross-correlation function. Fitting a simulation-derived template function to this measurement results in a 9σ detection significance. The coherent accumulation of the signal through cross-correlation is sufficient to enable a detection despite excess variance from foreground residuals ∼6–10 times brighter than the expected thermal noise level in the correlation function. These results are the highest-redshift measurement of 21 cm emission to date, and they set the stage for future 21 cm intensity mapping analyses at z > 1.8.

<br /><br />
总结: M31的巨大气体冲击可以用旋转的恒星条来自然解释。研究使用气体动力学模型独立测量了M31的条纹速度。模拟中的重力势是根据星体光度和动力学约束的一组定制模型。研究发现，为了匹配观测到的冲击特征，需要较低的条纹速度。包括星际物理学如恒星形成和恒星反馈对冲击幅度影响不大，并且不会显著改变冲击位置。如果内部气体盘允许跟随H i和电离气体观测类似地变化倾斜度，则具有38 km s−1 kpc−1的条纹速度的气体模型可以匹配冲击特征和中央气体特征，这与星体动力学模型一致。 <div>
The large-scale gaseous shocks in the bulge of M31 can be naturally explained by a rotating stellar bar. We use gas dynamical models to provide an independent measurement of the bar pattern speed in M31. The gravitational potentials of our simulations are from a set of made-to-measure models constrained by stellar photometry and kinematics. If the inclination of the gas disk is fixed at i = 77°, we find that a low pattern speed of 16–20 km s−1 kpc−1 is needed to match the observed position and amplitude of the shock features, as shock positions are too close to the bar major axis in high Ωb models. The pattern speed can increase to 20–30 km s−1 kpc−1 if the inner gas disk has a slightly smaller inclination angle compared with the outer one. Including subgrid physics such as star formation and stellar feedback has minor effects on the shock amplitude, and does not change the shock position significantly. If the inner gas disk is allowed to follow a varying inclination similar to the H i and ionized gas observations, the gas models with a pattern speed of 38 km s−1 kpc−1, which is consistent with stellar-dynamical models, can match both the shock features and the central gas features.

<div> 巨型恒星系合并、BOSS1244、红移2.24、哈勃空间望远镜、星系形成

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章报道了BOSS1244的两个巨型恒星系BOSS1244-QG1和BOSS1244-QG2，它们位于红移2.244和2.242处，且间隔约70kpc。这显示它们可能在合并形成质量类似于本地宇宙最质量的BCG。研究还发现在BOSS1244范围内，星系的星形成活跃度随密度增加而减少，这表明BCG和它们的前体的星形成可能受到环境相关过程的影响。这拓宽了我们对附近宇宙中成熟星系团和BCG共同演化的认识。 <div>
We report the detection of a pair of massive quiescent galaxies likely in the process of merging at the center of the spectroscopically confirmed, extremely massive protocluster BOSS1244 at z = 2.24 ± 0.02. These galaxies, BOSS1244-QG1 and BOSS1244-QG2, were detected with Hubble Space Telescope grism slitless spectroscopic observations. These two quiescent galaxies are among the brightest member galaxies, with z = 2.223–2.255 in BOSS1244, and reside at redshifts z = 2.244 and z = 2.242, with a half-light radius of 6.76 ± 0.50 kpc and 2.72 ± 0.16 kpc, respectively. BOSS1244-QG1 and BOSS1244-QG2 are separated by a projected distance of about 70 physical kpc, implying that the two galaxies likely merge to form a massive brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) with size and mass similar to the most massive BCGs in the local Universe. We thus infer that BCG formation through dry major mergers may happen earlier than the full assembly of a cluster core, which broadens our previous understanding of the coevolution of mature galaxy clusters and BCGs in the nearby Universe. Moreover, we find a strong density–star formation relation over a scale of ∼18 comoving Mpc in BOSS1244, i.e., star formation activity decreases as density increases, implying that the quenching of star formation in BCGs and their progenitors is likely governed by environment-related processes before the virialization of the cluster core.

总结: 
这篇文章主要研究了在磁化湍流分子云核中的非对称原恒星流的形成和早期演化。他们发现在低质量原恒星系统中，即使只有一个，也会形成单极流。单极流是在磁场较弱的云核中形成的，而比例参数μ为8和16。同时他们还发现了原恒星火箭效应，类似于火箭的发射和推进。单极流将原恒星系统从中心密集区域抛射到云核的外部区域，并且由于其抛射产生的动压抑制了额外新的流的驱动。相反，弯曲的双极流是在比例参数μ为4的磁化云核中形成的。父云核的磁场与湍动能的比例可能在形成非对称原恒星流中发挥关键作用。 <div>
Observed protostellar outflows exhibit a variety of asymmetrical features, including remarkable unipolar outflows and bending outflows. Revealing the formation and early evolution of such asymmetrical protostellar outflows, especially the unipolar outflows, is essential for a better understanding of the star and planet formation because they can dramatically change the mass accretion and angular momentum transport to the protostars and protoplanetary disks. Here we perform three-dimensional nonideal magnetohydrodynamics simulations to investigate the formation and early evolution of the asymmetrical protostellar outflows in magnetized turbulent isolated molecular cloud cores. We find, for the first time to our knowledge, that the unipolar outflow forms even in the single low-mass protostellar system. The results show that the unipolar outflow is driven in the weakly magnetized cloud cores with the dimensionless mass-to-flux ratios of μ = 8 and 16. Furthermore, we find the protostellar rocket effect of the unipolar outflow, which is similar to the launch and propulsion of a rocket. The unipolar outflow ejects the protostellar system from the central dense region to the outer region of the parent cloud core, and the ram pressure caused by its ejection suppresses the driving of additional new outflows. In contrast, the bending bipolar outflow is driven in the moderately magnetized cloud core with μ = 4. The ratio of the magnetic to turbulent energies of a parent cloud core may play a key role in the formation of asymmetrical protostellar outflows.

<br />总结: 本研究分析了通过Gravitationally Lensed Dusty Star-forming Galaxies (DSFGs) 对分子气体外流的观测数据，发现通过空间集成光谱的统计分析结果仅有一个源展现了OH吸收比[C ii]辐射更蓝移的特征，但通过通道图的信号分析发现了所有五个源中都存在OH吸收的不同动力学成分表现，这些成分可能追踪着旋转盘中的气体。研究指出了未来观测中需要改进大气吸收线的修正和更准确地测量源的连续谱的方法。 <div>
Galactic-scale outflows of molecular gas from star-forming galaxies constitute the most direct evidence for the regulation of star formation. In the early Universe (z > 4), such outflows have recently been inferred from gravitationally lensed dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) based on ubiquitous detections of OH absorption extending to more blueshifted velocities than [C ii] or CO emission in spatially integrated spectra. Because these lines are redshifted to submillimeter wavelengths, such measurements require careful corrections for atmospheric absorption lines, and a proper accounting of sometimes large variations in measurement uncertainties over these lines. Taking these factors into consideration, we reanalyze OH and [C ii] data taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array for five sources where such data are available, of which four were categorised as exhibiting outflows. Based on their spatially integrated spectra alone, we find statistically significant (≥3σ) OH absorption more blueshifted than [C ii] emission in only one source. By contrast, searching channel maps for signals diluted below the detection threshold in spatially integrated spectra, we find evidence for a separate kinematic component in OH absorption in all five sources in the form of (i) more blueshifted OH absorption than [C ii] emission and/or (ii) a component in OH absorption exhibiting a different spatio-kinematic pattern than in [C ii] emission, the latter presumably tracing gas in a rotating disk. Providing a more complete and accurate assessment of molecular outflows in gravitationally lensed DSFGs, we suggest methods to assess the precision of corrections for atmospheric absorption better and to measure the source continuum in future observations more accurately.

We report timing and spectral studies of the high-mass X-ray binary 4U 1700-37 using Insight-HXMT observations carried out in 2020 during its out-of-eclipse state. We found significant variations in flux on a timescale of kilo-seconds, while the hardness (count rate ratio between 10–30 keV and 2–10 keV) remains relatively stable. No evident pulsations were found over a frequency range of 10−3–2000 Hz. During the spectral analysis, for the first time, we took the configuration of different Insight-HXMT detectors’ orientations into account, which allows us to obtain reliable results even if stable contamination exists in the field of view. We found that the spectrum could be well described by some phenomenological models that are commonly used in accreting pulsars (e.g., a power law with a high energy cutoff) in the energy range of 2–100 keV. We found hints of cyclotron absorption features around ∼16 keV or/and ∼50 keV.

Measuring the mass–radius relation of individual white dwarfs is an empirically challenging task that has been performed for only a few dozen stars. We measure the white dwarf mass–radius relation using the gravitational redshifts and radii of 135 white dwarfs in wide binaries with main-sequence companions. We obtain the radial velocities of these systems using the main-sequence companion, and subtract these Doppler redshifts from the white dwarfs’ apparent motions, isolating their gravitational redshifts. We use Gaia data to calculate the surface temperatures and radii of these white dwarfs, thereby deriving an empirical gravitational redshift–radius relation. This work demonstrates the utility of low-resolution Galactic surveys to measure the white dwarf equation of state. Our results are consistent with theoretical models, and represent the largest sample of individual white dwarf gravitational redshift measurements to date.

Observations of linear polarization in the 2–8 keV energy range with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) explore the magnetic field geometry and dynamics of the regions generating nonthermal radiation in relativistic jets of blazars. These jets, particularly in blazars whose spectral energy distribution peaks at X-ray energies, emit X-rays via synchrotron radiation from high-energy particles within the jet. IXPE observations of the X-ray-selected BL Lac–type blazar 1ES 1959+650 on 2022 May 3–4 showed a significant linear polarization degree of Πx = 8.0% ± 2.3% at an electric-vector position angle ψx = 123° ± 8°. However, on 2022 June 9–12, only an upper limit of Πx ≤ 5.1% could be derived (at the 99% confidence level). The degree of optical polarization at that time, ΠO ∼ 5%, is comparable to the X-ray measurement. We investigate possible scenarios for these findings, including temporal and geometrical depolarization effects. Unlike some other X-ray-selected BL Lac objects, there is no significant chromatic dependence of the measured polarization in 1ES 1959+650, and its low X-ray polarization may be attributed to turbulence in the jet flow with dynamical timescales shorter than 1 day.

The nature of energy generation, transport, and effective dissipation responsible for maintaining a hot solar upper atmosphere is still elusive. The Poynting flux is a vital parameter for describing the direction and magnitude of the energy flow, which is mainly used in solar physics for estimating the upward energy generated by photospheric plasma motion. This study presents a pioneering 3D mapping of the magnetic energy transport within a numerically simulated solar atmosphere. By calculating the Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent of the energy velocity, defined as the ratio of the Poynting flux to the magnetic energy density, we precisely identify the sources and destinations of the magnetic energy flow throughout the solar atmosphere. This energy mapping reveals the presence of transport barriers in the lower atmosphere, restricting the amount of magnetic energy from the photosphere reaching the chromosphere and corona. Interacting kinematic and magnetic vortices create energy channels, breaking through these barriers and allowing three times more energy input from photospheric motions to reach the upper atmosphere than before the vortices formed. The vortex system also substantially alters the energy mapping, acting as a source and deposition of energy, leading to localized energy concentration. Furthermore, our results show that the energy is transported following a vortical motion: the Poynting flux vortex. In regions where these vortices coexist, they favor conditions for energy dissipation through ohmic and viscous heating, since they naturally create large gradients in the magnetic and velocity fields over small spatial scales. Hence, the vortex system promotes local plasma heating, leading to temperatures around a million Kelvins.

The investigation of mechanisms responsible for the heating of cold solar wind electrons around the Earth’s bow shock is an important problem in heliospheric plasma physics because such heating is vitally required to run the shock drift acceleration at the bow shock. The prospective mechanism for electron heating is magnetic pumping, which considers electron adiabatic (compressional) heating by ultralow-frequency waves and simultaneous scattering by high-frequency fluctuations. Existing models of magnetic pumping have operated with external sources of such fluctuations. In this study, we generalize these models by introducing the self-consistent electron scattering by whistler-mode waves generated due to the anisotropic electron heating process. We consider an electron population captured within a magnetic trap created by ultralow-frequency waves. Periodical adiabatic heating and cooling of this population drives the generation of whistler-mode waves scattering electrons in the pitch-angle space. The combination of adiabatic heating and whistler-driven scattering provides electron acceleration and the formation of a suprathermal electron population that can further participate in the shock drift acceleration.

总结: 
本文研究了宇宙中的星系结构和环境对星系停止形成新恒星的影响。在低密度环境中，发现了一个特征的表面密度Σ1 kpc，超过这个密度会触发星系停止形成新恒星，而这一现象几乎不受质量的影响。在高密度环境中，对红移高于1的星系和低密度环境中的星系几乎没有区别，但在红移小于1时，低质量星系的停止形成新恒星现象与质量的关联性增强，这是由于更强烈的环境影响。另外，发现停止形成新恒星的现象在红移较低时显示出强烈的演化，可能是由于在高红移时星系的暗物质含量和气体含量更高，因此需要更强的黑洞能量来停止新恒星的形成。同时，在较低红移时，角动量的抑制效果也更加显著，这与来自活动星系核的物质反馈效应相辅相成。 <div>
In a previous work, we investigated the structural and environmental dependence on quenching in the nearby universe. In this work, we extend our investigations to higher redshifts by combining galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and The FourStar Galaxy Evolution surveys. In low density, we find a characteristic Σ1 kpc above which the quenching is initiated as indicated by their population-averaged color. shows only a weak mass dependency at all redshifts, which suggests that the internal quenching process is more related to the physics that acts in the central region of galaxies. In high density, for galaxies at z > 1 is almost indistinguishable from their low-density counterparts. At z < 1, for low-mass galaxies becomes progressively strongly mass dependent, which is due to the increasingly stronger environmental effects at lower redshifts. in low density shows strong redshift evolution with ∼1 dex decrement from z = 2.5–0. It is likely that at a given stellar mass, the host halo is on average more massive and gas-rich at higher redshifts; hence, a higher level of integrated energy from a more massive black hole (BH) is required to quench. As the halo evolves from the cold to hot accretion phase at lower redshifts, the gas is shock-heated and becomes more vulnerable to the feedback processes from active galactic nucleus as predicted by theory. Meanwhile, angular momentum quenching also becomes more effective at low redshifts, which complements a lower level of integrated energy from the BH to quench.

<title>The 2022 Outburst of IGR J17091–3624: Connecting the Exotic GRS 1915+105 to Standard Black Hole X-Ray Binaries</title>

<div> 黑洞X射线双星，脉动变化，IGR J17091–3624，NICER/NuSTAR，铁发射线

IGR J17091–3624在NICER/NuSTAR时代首次爆发，数据显示其从硬态到中间态再转变为软态，出现了两种不同类别的心跳变化，同时伴随着光谱特征的变化。在软态时，只有伴随着心跳变化才能检测到高度电离的铁吸收线。这一发现表明IGR J17091–3624可以被视为GRS 1915+105和“正常” BHXBs之间的桥梁，因为它在传统和奇特的BHXB行为之间变换。文章讨论了吸收物质和奇特变化的物理性质。 <br /><br />总结: 黑洞X射线双星IGR J17091–3624显示出了在软态时伴随着奇特变化的高度电离的铁吸收线，这表明它可能是GRS 1915+105和“正常” BHXBs之间的过渡形态。 <div>
While the standard X-ray variability of black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs) is stochastic and noisy, there are two known BHXBs that exhibit exotic “heartbeat”-like variability in their lightcurves: GRS 1915+105 and IGR J17091–3624. In 2022, IGR J17091–3624 went into outburst for the first time in the NICER/NuSTAR era. These exquisite data allow us to simultaneously track the exotic variability and the corresponding spectral features with unprecedented detail. We find that as in typical BHXBs, the outburst began in the hard state, then continued in the intermediate state, but then transitioned to an exotic soft state, where we identify two types of heartbeat-like variability (Class V and a new Class X). The flux energy spectra show a broad iron emission line due to relativistic reflection when there is no exotic variability, and absorption features from highly ionized iron when the source exhibits exotic variability. Whether absorption lines from highly ionized iron are detected in IGR J17091–3624 is not determined by the spectral state alone, but rather is determined by the presence of exotic variability; in a soft spectral state, absorption lines are only detected along with exotic variability. Our finding indicates that IGR J17091–3624 can be seen as a bridge between the most peculiar BHXB GRS 1915+105 and “normal” BHXBs, because it alternates between the conventional and exotic behaviors of BHXBs. We discuss the physical nature of the absorbing material and exotic variability in light of this new legacy data set.

RS CVn型星，日冕质量抛射（CMEs），II Pegasi，耀斑，分光观测。该研究报告了使用高分辨率光谱观测捕获了II Pegasi（II Peg）上可能存在CME或色球凝结的情况。观测期间检测到两次耀斑，耀斑的能量下限分别为1033 erg和1034 erg。通过平均光谱相减，Hα残留光谱在耀斑期间表现出红移不对称性，而在第二次耀斑期间观察到了远红移的额外发射组分，其大速度显示了可能是一个日珥喷发事件。CME的质量估计为0.83–1.48 × 1020 g，动能为0.76–1.15 × 1035 erg，不足够与从太阳事件外推的动能相媲美。最后，在没有耀斑发生时，通过合成光谱相减得到了残留的Hα轮廓，其中有一个蓝移宽成分与Hα活跃特征相关。 <div>
Stellar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) have recently attracted much attention for their impacts on stellar evolution and surrounding exoplanets. RS CVn-type stars could produce large flares, and therefore may have frequent CMEs. Here we report the capture of a possible CME or chromospheric condensation on the RS CVn-type star II Pegasi (II Peg) using high-resolution spectroscopic observation. Two flares were detected during the observation, and the low limits of the flare energies are of the order of 1033 erg and 1034 erg, respectively. Using mean spectrum subtraction, the Hα residual shows red asymmetry during the flares, and the redshifted broad emission components are probably caused by chromospheric condensation or coronal rain. Moreover, a far redshifted extra emission component with a high bulk velocity of 429 km s−1 was observed during the second flare and is probably due to a prominence eruption. The velocity greatly exceeds the star’s escape velocity, which means that this eruption can develop into a CME. The CME mass is estimated to be 0.83–1.48 × 1020 g, which is slightly larger than the value expected from solar flare-CME extrapolation. The kinetic energy of CME, derived to be 0.76–1.15 × 1035 erg, is less than the kinetic energy extrapolated from solar events. Additionally, we could not completely rule out the possibility of chromospheric condensation resulting in the far redshifted extra emission. Finally, there is a blueshifted broad component in the subtracted Hα profile derived using synthesized spectral subtraction when no flare happened, and its behavior is associated with the Hα activity features.

We present emission maps ( scale, corresponding to 0.18 pc) of the DCN (J = 2 − 1) and DCO+ (J = 2 − 1) lines in the 2 mm band toward the Orion KL region obtained with the 2 mm receiver system named B4R installed on the Large Millimeter Telescope. The DCN emission shows a peak at the Orion KL hot core position, whereas no DCO+ emission has been detected there. The DCO+ emission shows enhancement at the west side of the hot core, which is well shielded from the UV radiation from OB massive stars in the Trapezium cluster. We have derived the abundance ratio of DCN/DCO+ at three representative positions where both species have been detected. The gas components with VLSR ≈ 7.5–8.7 km s−1 are associated with low abundance ratios of ∼4–6, whereas much higher abundance ratios (∼22–30) are derived for the gas components with VLSR ≈ 9.2–11.6 km s−1. We have compared the observed abundance ratio to our chemical models and found that the observed differences in the DCN/DCO+ abundance ratios are explained by different densities.

<title>Deep Chandra Observations of A2495: A Possible Sloshing-regulated Feedback Cycle in a Triple-offset Galaxy Cluster</title>

<div> 关键词: A2495, Chandra observations, ICM, BCG, AGN feedback

总结: 
A2495是一个研究对象，通过深入的Chandra观测发现了ICM、BCG和Hα发光气体之间的偏移。新的数据确认了X射线发射峰值距离BCG约6.2 kpc，距离Hα发射峰值约3.9 kpc。研究发现了ICM中两代X射线空腔，由中央射电星系活动引起。AGN的能量足以抵消ICM冷却的辐射损失，表明A2495仍然具有有效的反馈循环。偏移很可能是由ICM的搅动引起的，这得到了螺旋结构和在距离中心东部约58 kpc处可能存在的冷锋的支持。最后，研究发现两代X射线空腔之间的喷发间隔与动态搅动的时间尺度相当，因此推测搅动可能会调节A2495中AGN反馈的时间尺度。 <div>
We present the analysis of new, deep Chandra observations (130 ks) of the galaxy cluster A2495. This object is known for the presence of a triple offset between the peaks of the intracluster medium (ICM), the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), and the warm gas glowing in Hα line. The new Chandra data confirm that the X-ray emission peak is located at a distance of ∼6.2 kpc from the BCG, and at ∼3.9 kpc from the Hα emission peak. Moreover, we identify two generations of X-ray cavities in the ICM, likely inflated by the central radio galaxy activity. Through a detailed morphological and spectral analysis, we determine that the power of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) outbursts (Pcav = 4.7 ± 1.3 × 1043 erg s−1) is enough to counterbalance the radiative losses from ICM cooling (Lcool = 5.7 ± 0.1 × 1043 erg s−1). This indicates that, despite a fragmented cooling core, A2495 still harbors an effective feedback cycle. We argue that the offsets are most likely caused by sloshing of the ICM, supported by the presence of spiral structures and a probable cold front in the gas at ∼58 kpc east of the center. Ultimately, we find that the outburst interval between the two generations of X-ray cavities is of the order of the dynamical sloshing timescale, as already hinted from the previous Chandra snapshot. We thus speculate that sloshing may be able to regulate the timescales of AGN feedback in A2495, by periodically fueling the central AGN.

在SDSS J1531+3414星系团中，两个中心星系正在进行重大的合并，周围环绕着一条由19个年轻恒星超星团组成的链状结构。新的Chandra X射线成像揭示了迅速冷却的热（T∼106K）星团内气体，其中两个“翼”形成了一个凹凸不平的密度不连续，靠近冷核心的边缘。 LOFAR 144 MHz观测揭示了与“翼”引人注目地对齐的扩散射电发射，这表明“翼”实际上是一个巨大的X射线超空洞的开口。北部的超空洞处，GMOS探测到包围恒星超星团的温暖（T∼104K）电离气体，但与南部中心星系相比，呈现出高达+800 km s−1的红移。阿塔卡马大型毫米/亚毫米阵列探测到一个类似红移的∼1010M⊙的冷（T∼102K）分子气体储库，但它与年轻恒星相偏移约1-3千秒差距。我们提出，多相气体源自被X射线超空洞卷入的低熵气体，将年轻恒星和分子气体之间的偏移归因于星系团内湍流运动，并建议潮汐相互作用刺激了“串珠状”星形成形态。<br /><br />总结: 在SDSS J1531+3414星系团中发现了两个中心星系的重大合并以及周围的年轻星团链结构，Chandra X射线成像揭示了迅速冷却的热星团内气体和超空洞，LOFAR观测揭示了与超空洞对齐的扩散射电发射，GMOS和阿塔卡马大型毫米/亚毫米阵列观测也揭示了一系列相关现象，这些发现为研究合并、AGN反馈和星形成的相互作用提供了重要实验室。 <div>
With two central galaxies engaged in a major merger and a remarkable chain of 19 young stellar superclusters wound around them in projection, the galaxy cluster SDSS J1531+3414 (z = 0.335) offers an excellent laboratory to study the interplay between mergers, active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, and star formation. New Chandra X-ray imaging reveals rapidly cooling hot (T ∼ 106 K) intracluster gas, with two “wings” forming a concave density discontinuity near the edge of the cool core. LOFAR 144 MHz observations uncover diffuse radio emission strikingly aligned with the “wings,” suggesting that the “wings” are actually the opening to a giant X-ray supercavity. The steep radio emission is likely an ancient relic of one of the most energetic AGN outbursts observed, with 4pV > 1061 erg. To the north of the supercavity, GMOS detects warm (T ∼ 104 K) ionized gas that enshrouds the stellar superclusters but is redshifted up to +800 km s−1 with respect to the southern central galaxy. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array detects a similarly redshifted ∼1010M⊙ reservoir of cold (T ∼ 102 K) molecular gas, but it is offset from the young stars by ∼1–3 kpc. We propose that the multiphase gas originated from low-entropy gas entrained by the X-ray supercavity, attribute the offset between the young stars and the molecular gas to turbulent intracluster gas motions, and suggest that tidal interactions stimulated the “beads-on-a-string” star formation morphology.

Multi-messenger astrophysics has produced a wealth of data with much more to come in the future. This enormous data set will reveal new insights into the physics of core-collapse supernovae, neutron star mergers, and many other objects where it is actually possible, if not probable, that new physics is in operation. To tease out different possibilities, we will need to analyze signals from photons, neutrinos, gravitational waves, and chemical elements. This task is made all the more difficult when it is necessary to evolve the neutrino component of the radiation field and associated quantum-mechanical property of flavor in order to model the astrophysical system of interest—a numerical challenge that has not been addressed to this day. In this work, we take a step in this direction by adopting the technique of angular-integrated moments with a truncated tower of dynamical equations and a closure, convolving the flavor-transformation with spatial transport to evolve the neutrino radiation quantum field. We show that moments capture the dynamical features of fast flavor instabilities in a variety of systems, although our technique is by no means a universal blueprint for solving fast flavor transformation. To evaluate the effectiveness of our moment results, we compare to a more precise particle-in-cell method. Based on our results, we propose areas for improvement and application to complementary techniques in the future.

<div> 高红移星系，JWST观测，光度选择，尺寸-星团质量关系，星系结构演化。<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用JWST的观测数据，在高红移星系中鉴定了341个星系，并在文献中找到109个星系的光谱红移测量。研究发现，这些高红移星系的UV大小-恒星质量关系与z∼3的星系相似，但整体尺寸要小约0.7 dex。此外，发现这些星系的平均大小演化速率比已有文献中的推测值更缓慢。一部分星系呈现出较小的尺寸，但具有极高的星团形成表面密度，这与当地星系样本中的特征不同。此外，观测表明这些星系中没有超大质量黑洞的持续吸积。最后发现，这些高红移星系的UV和光学尺寸相当。这些结果表明早期星系可能是从内向外构建结构，尚未表现出低红移时期明显的颜色梯度。 <div>
We present a comprehensive search and analysis of high-redshift galaxies in a suite of nine public JWST extragalactic fields taken in Cycle 1, covering a total effective search area of . Through conservative (8σ) photometric selection, we identify 341 galaxies at 5 < z < 14, with 109 having spectroscopic redshift measurements from the literature, including recent JWST NIRSpec observations. Our regression analysis reveals that the rest-frame UV size–stellar mass relation follows , similar to that of star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 3, but scaled down in size by ∼0.7 dex. We find a much slower rate for the average size evolution over the redshift range, Reff ∝ (1 + z)−0.4±0.2, than that derived in the literature. A fraction (∼13%) of our sample galaxies are marginally resolved even in the NIRCam imaging (≲100 pc), located at ≳1.5σ below the derived size–mass slope. These compact sources exhibit a high star formation surface density ΣSFR > 10 M⊙ yr−1 kpc−2, a range in which only <0.01% of the local star-forming galaxy sample is found. For those with available NIRSpec data, no evidence of ongoing supermassive black hole accretion is observed. A potential explanation for the observed high [O iii]-to-Hβ ratios could be high shock velocities, likely originating within intense star-forming regions characterized by high ΣSFR. Lastly, we find that the rest-frame UV and optical sizes of our sample are comparable. Our results are consistent with these early galaxies building up their structures inside out and being yet to exhibit the strong color gradient seen at lower redshift.

EVQs是极端变异类星系核，研究了它们的光谱特性，发现了“亮时更蓝”的趋势，表明EVQs的光谱变化与普通类星体和活动星系核相一致。此外，在EVQs的Mg ii和C iv谱线中检测到了明显的内在Baldwin效应（即在各个活跃星系核中，在较高的连续光流下，线等效宽度较小）。然而，在宽Hβ线上并未发现系统的内在Baldwin效应，可能是由于较长波长处强烈的宿主污染。此外，通过比较EVQs的iBeff斜率与文献中的变样类星体，发现变样类星体很可能是EVQs的一个偏倚子群，而不是一个截然不同的星系核种群。最后，发现Hβ、Mg ii和C iv的宽线呼吸没有显著的变化，表明类星体的宽线呼吸可能会在较长时间尺度（约3000天）内消失。<br /><br />总结:EVQs的光谱显示出“亮时更蓝”的趋势，同时在Mg ii和C iv谱线中检测到了内在的Baldwin效应。变样类星体很可能是EVQs的一个偏斜子群。此外，在较长时间尺度内，类星体的宽线呼吸可能会消失。 <div>
We previously built a sample of 14,012 extremely variable quasars (EVQs) based on Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Pan-STARRS1 photometric observations. In this work we present the spectral fitting to their SDSS spectra and study the spectral variation in 1259 EVQs with multiepoch SDSS spectra (after prudently excluding spectra with potentially unreliable spectroscopic photometry). We find a clear “bluer-when-brighter” trend in EVQs, consistent with previous findings of normal quasars and active galactic nuclei. We detect significant intrinsic Baldwin effect (iBeff, i.e., smaller line equivalent width at higher continuum flux in individual active galactic nuclei) in the broad Mg ii and C iv lines of EVQs. Meanwhile, no systematical iBeff is found for the broad Hβ line, which could be attributed to strong host contamination at longer wavelengths. Remarkably, by comparing the iBeff slope of EVQs with archived changing-look quasars, we show that the changing-look quasars identified in the literature are most likely a biased (due to its definition) subpopulation of EVQs, rather than a distinct population of quasars. We also found no significant broad line breathing of Hβ, Mg ii, or C iv, suggesting the broad line breathing in quasars may disappear at longer timescales (∼3000 days).

We present Chandra ACIS-S imaging spectroscopy results of the extended (1.″5–8″, 300–1600 pc) hard X-ray emission of NGC 5728, the host galaxy of a Compton-thick active galactic nucleus. We find spectrally and spatially resolved features in the Fe Kα complex (5.0–7.5 keV) redward and blueward of the neutral Fe line at 6.4 keV in the extended narrow-line region bicone. A simple phenomenological fit of a power law plus Gaussians gives a significance of 5.4σ and 3.7σ for the red and blue wings, respectively. Fits to a suite of physically consistent models confirm a significance of ≥3σ for the red wing. The significance of the blue wing may be diminished by the presence of rest-frame highly ionized Fe xxv and Fe xxvi lines (1.4σ–3.7σ range). A detailed investigation of the Chandra ACIS-S point-spread function and comparison with the observed morphology demonstrates that these red and blue wings are radially extended (∼5″, ∼1 kpc) along the optical bicone axis. If the wing emission is due solely to redshifted and blueshifted high-velocity neutral Fe Kα, then the implied line-of-sight velocities are +/− ∼0.1c, and their fluxes are consistent with being equal. A symmetric high-velocity outflow is then a viable explanation. This outflow has deprojected velocities ∼100 times larger than the outflows detected in optical spectroscopic studies, potentially dominating the kinetic feedback power.

We consider small-scale jetlike events that might make the solar wind, as has been suggested in recent studies. We show that the events referred to as “coronal jets” and as “jetlets” both fall on a power-law distribution that also includes large-scale eruptions and spicule-sized features; all of the jetlike events could contribute to the solar wind. Based on imaging and magnetic field data, it is plausible that many or most of these events might form by the same mechanism: Magnetic flux cancelation produces small-scale flux ropes, often containing a cool-material minifilament. This minifilament/flux rope erupts and reconnects with adjacent open coronal field, along which “plasma jets” flow and contribute to the solar wind. The erupting flux ropes can contain twist that is transferred to the open field, and these become Alfvénic pulses that form magnetic switchbacks, providing an intrinsic connection between switchbacks and the production of the solar wind.

<div> 关键词: 出流, 吸收线类型, 宿主星系, 恒星形成率, 演化阶段 <br />
总结: 该研究利用Sloan Digital Sky Survey类星体目录，使用[O II]和[Ne V]发射线的流量比作为指标，比较了显示不同出流吸收线类型的类星体的宿主星系内的恒星形成率。研究发现，LoMini-BAL类星体的恒星形成率与LoNAL类星体相当，略低于LoBAL类星体，但明显高于HiBAL类星体。此外，HiMini-BAL类星体的恒星形成率与HiNAL或非吸收线（Non-abs）类星体相似，但明显高于HiBAL类星体。研究结果表明，不同的吸收线类型可能反映了类星体的演化阶段，提出了一个综合的演化顺序：LoBAL逐渐演变成LoMini-BAL/LoNAL，然后进化成HiBAL，最终形成HiMini-BAL/HiNAL/Non-abs。与此同时，在类星体的宿主星系中，恒星形成率在LoNAL阶段朝向结束时明显下降，在HiMini-BAL阶段之前再次恢复。 <div>
It is commonly accepted that outflows from the central regions of quasars play a substantial role in regulating the global properties of the host galaxy. These outflows are typically detected through blueshifted absorption lines. However, the question remains whether outflows observed with different absorption line types indeed reflect the same environmental or evolutionary stage of the host galaxy. In this study, we use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasar catalog and employ the flux ratio of [O II] and [Ne V] emission lines as indicators to compare star formation rates (SFRs) within host galaxies of quasars exhibiting various outflow absorption line types: low-ionization broad absorption line (LoBAL), low-ionization Mini-BAL (LoMini-BAL), low-ionization narrow absorption line (LoNAL), high-ionization broad absorption line (HiBAL), high-ionization Mini-BAL (HiMini-BAL), and high-ionization narrow absorption line (HiNAL). Our findings indicate that the SFR of LoMini-BAL quasars is comparable to that of LoNAL quasars, somewhat less than that of LoBAL quasars, but markedly greater than that of HiBAL quasars. Furthermore, the SFR of HiMini-BAL quasars mirrors that of HiNAL or Non-abs (no associated absorption lines) quasars, but is significantly higher than that of HiBAL quasars. If we consider that differing absorption line types are indicative of the quasar evolution stage, our results propose an inclusive evolution sequence: LoBALs evolve into LoMini-BALs/LoNALs, then progress to HiBALs, and ultimately morph into HiMini-BALs/HiNALs/Non-abs. Concomitantly, the SFR within the host galaxies of quasars appears to decline noticeably nearing the LoNAL phase’s end and rejuvenates before the HiMini-BAL phase.

Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discovered unexpectedly abundant luminous galaxies at high redshift, posing possibly a severe challenge to popular galaxy formation models. We study early structure formation in a cosmological model with a blue, tilted power spectrum (BTPS) given by with ms > 1 at small length scales. We run a set of cosmological N-body simulations and derive the abundance of dark matter halos and galaxies under simplified assumptions on star formation efficiency. The enhanced small-scale power allows rapid nonlinear structure formation at z > 7, and galaxies with stellar mass exceeding 1010M⊙ can be formed by z = 9. Because of frequent mergers, the structure of galaxies and galaxy groups appears clumpy. The BTPS model reproduces the observed stellar mass density at z = 7–9, and thus eases the claimed tension between galaxy formation theory and recent JWST observations. The large-scale structure of the present-day Universe is largely unaffected by the modification of the small-scale power spectrum. We conduct a systematic study by varying the slope of the small-scale power spectrum to derive constraints on the BTPS model from a set of observations of high-redshift galaxies.

<div> CMB lensing, ACT DR6, power spectrum, constraints, structure growth
总结:
本文介绍了关于宇宙微波背景(CMB)透镜效应的新测量结果，使用了Atacama宇宙学望远镜（ACT）数据发布6（DR6）的CMB数据集。利用新的方法得出了CMB透镜功率谱的振幅，提供了对宇宙结构增长幅度的约束。该研究结果与Planck或ACT DR4 + WMAP CMB功率谱测量的ΛCDM模型约束完全一致，表明了在红移z∼0.5–5范围内并无宇宙结构振幅抑制的证据。通过分析大量的空测、一致性检验以及系统误差评估，确保了结果的可靠性和稳健性。同时，该测量结果还提供了关于大尺度结构增长的独立信息，不依赖于Planck或星系调查数据。 <div>
We present new measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing over 9400 deg2 of the sky. These lensing measurements are derived from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6) CMB data set, which consists of five seasons of ACT CMB temperature and polarization observations. We determine the amplitude of the CMB lensing power spectrum at 2.3% precision (43σ significance) using a novel pipeline that minimizes sensitivity to foregrounds and to noise properties. To ensure that our results are robust, we analyze an extensive set of null tests, consistency tests, and systematic error estimates and employ a blinded analysis framework. Our CMB lensing power spectrum measurement provides constraints on the amplitude of cosmic structure that do not depend on Planck or galaxy survey data, thus giving independent information about large-scale structure growth and potential tensions in structure measurements. The baseline spectrum is well fit by a lensing amplitude of Alens = 1.013 ± 0.023 relative to the Planck 2018 CMB power spectra best-fit ΛCDM model and Alens = 1.005 ± 0.023 relative to the ACT DR4 + WMAP best-fit model. From our lensing power spectrum measurement, we derive constraints on the parameter combination of from ACT DR6 CMB lensing alone and when combining ACT DR6 and Planck NPIPE CMB lensing power spectra. These results are in excellent agreement with ΛCDM model constraints from Planck or ACT DR4 + WMAP CMB power spectrum measurements. Our lensing measurements from redshifts z ∼ 0.5–5 are thus fully consistent with ΛCDM structure growth predictions based on CMB anisotropies probing primarily z ∼ 1100. We find no evidence for a suppression of the amplitude of cosmic structure at low redshifts.

<div> CMB, gravitational lensing, cosmological constraints, ΛCDM, neutrino<br />
总结:<br />
本研究利用通过ACT进行的CMB测量重建了一个重力透镜质量图，涵盖了9400平方度。结合声学振荡和宇宙核合成的测量结果，得出了聚集幅度σ8 = 0.819 ± 0.015和哈勃常数H0 = (68.3 ± 1.1) km s−1 Mpc−1。这些测量结果与Planck CMB镜头的联合约束一致。研究还对KiDS、DES和HSC的星系调查结果进行了重新评估，发现S8值均低于ACT+Planck镜头的水平。此外，研究还限制了中微子质量∑mν < 0.13 eV（95%置信水平）。总的来说，研究结果独立证实了宇宙是平坦的，符合广义相对论，并且与ΛCDM模型相当一致，为未来地基CMB调查中的中微子物理铺平了一条充满希望的道路。 <div>
We present cosmological constraints from a gravitational lensing mass map covering 9400 deg2 reconstructed from measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) made by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) from 2017 to 2021. In combination with measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations and big bang nucleosynthesis, we obtain the clustering amplitude σ8 = 0.819 ± 0.015 at 1.8% precision, , and the Hubble constant H0 = (68.3 ± 1.1) km s−1 Mpc−1 at 1.6% precision. A joint constraint with Planck CMB lensing yields σ8 = 0.812 ± 0.013, , and H0 = (68.1 ± 1.0) km s−1 Mpc−1. These measurements agree with ΛCDM extrapolations from the CMB anisotropies measured by Planck. We revisit constraints from the KiDS, DES, and HSC galaxy surveys with a uniform set of assumptions and find that S8 from all three are lower than that from ACT+Planck lensing by levels ranging from 1.7σ to 2.1σ. This motivates further measurements and comparison, not just between the CMB anisotropies and galaxy lensing but also between CMB lensing probing z ∼ 0.5–5 on mostly linear scales and galaxy lensing at z ∼ 0.5 on smaller scales. We combine with CMB anisotropies to constrain extensions of ΛCDM, limiting neutrino masses to ∑mν < 0.13 eV (95% c.l.), for example. We describe the mass map and related data products that will enable a wide array of cross-correlation science. Our results provide independent confirmation that the universe is spatially flat, conforms with general relativity, and is described remarkably well by the ΛCDM model, while paving a promising path for neutrino physics with lensing from upcoming ground-based CMB surveys.

We report superluminal jet motion with an apparent speed of βapp = 1.65 ± 0.57 in the radio-quiet (RQ) low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) galaxy KISSR 872. This result comes from two-epoch phase-referenced very long baseline interferometry observations at 5 GHz. The detection of bulk relativistic motion in the jet of this extremely radio-faint active galactic nucleus (AGN), with a total 1.4 GHz flux density of 5 mJy in the 5.″4 resolution Very Large Array FIRST survey image and 1.5 mJy in the ∼5 mas resolution Very Long Baseline Array image, is the first of its kind in an RQ LINER galaxy. The presence of relativistic jets in lower accretion rate objects like KISSR 872, with an Eddington ratio of 0.04, reveals that even RQ AGN can harbor relativistic jets and provides evidence of their universality over a wide range of accretion powers.

<div> Spitzer, Messier 58, H2, AGN, jet<br />
<br />总结:<br />这篇文章讨论了在质量巨大的螺旋星系Messier 58的中心发现了高亮度、温暖的H2盘，并且还有一个具有辐射强活动的活动星系核。研究显示星系内部受到了辐射喷流包覆的冲击，尤其在内部2.6千秒差距的范围内。通过各种成像和光谱显示，大部分分子气体在原地受到了冲击，形成了盘状的灰尘分子气体通道朝向星系核心。碳氧化合物和电离气体的动力学表现十分混乱，速度分散达到300km/s。这种动能和湍流的耗散很可能是由辐射喷流驱动的外流注入星际介质所导致的，并且可能是观测到的分子和电离气体的排放的动力来源。尽管存在辐射喷流活动，内部盘中多环芳烃（PAH）的含量和组成看起来是正常的。PAH的比值表明这些物质是受到了来自星神的间星辐射场的激发，而不是星的形成活动的贡献。喷流冲击的H2现象可能显著减少恒星形成，并帮助调节星系内部盘和超大质量黑洞的质量，在这个通常来说是正常的螺旋星系中发现了类似强烈的H2排放。 <div>
Spitzer spectral maps reveal a disk of highly luminous, warm (>150 K) H2 in the center of the massive spiral galaxy Messier 58, which hosts a radio-loud active galactic nucleus (AGN). The inner 2.6 kpc of the galaxy appears to be overrun by shocks from the radio jet cocoon. Gemini NIRI imaging of the H2 1–0 S(1) emission line, Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array CO 2–1, and Hubble Space Telescope multiband imagery indicate that much of the molecular gas is shocked in situ, corresponding to lanes of dusty molecular gas that spiral toward the galactic nucleus. The CO 2–1 and ionized gas kinematics are highly disturbed, with velocity dispersion up to 300 km s−1. Dissipation of the associated kinetic energy and turbulence, likely injected into the interstellar medium by radio-jet-driven outflows, may power the observed molecular and ionized gas emission from the inner disk. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) fraction and composition in the inner disk appear to be normal, in spite of the jet and AGN activity. The PAH ratios are consistent with excitation by the interstellar radiation field from old stars in the bulge, with no contribution from star formation. The phenomenon of jet-shocked H2 may substantially reduce star formation and help to regulate the stellar mass of the inner disk and supermassive black hole in this otherwise normal spiral galaxy. Similarly strong H2 emission is found at the centers of several nearby spiral and lenticular galaxies with massive bulges and radio-loud AGNs.

通过使用詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜的近红外摄像机宽场无缝光谱仪(NIRCam WFSS)和近红外光谱仪(NIRSpec)，在宇宙演化早期释放调查中测量了155个红移大于2的星系的静止框下光学发射线比。盲目的NIRCam光栅观察包括一组未在NIRSpec掩模上观察到的具有明亮发射线的星系样本。我们通过与较低红移的SDSS、CLEAR和MOSDEF样本进行比较，研究了Hα、[O III]/Hβ和[Ne III]/[O II]发射线随红移的变化。我们发现[O III]/Hβ与红移存在显著(>3σ)的相关性，而[Ne III]/[O II]与红移有边缘(2σ)的相关性。我们将[O III]/Hβ和[Ne III]/[O II]与恒星质量和Hβ SFR进行比较。我们发现这两种发射线比与Hβ SFR呈相关，并与红移0<9的恒星质量呈反相关。与MAPPINGS V模型的比较表明，这些趋势与低金属丰度和高电离在低质量和高SFR的星系一致。我们还与IllustrisTNG预测进行了比较，并发现它们有效地描述了我们样本中观察到的最高[O III]/Hβ比值，而不需要引入具有显著冲击电离组分的MAPPINGS模型。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究利用詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜的不同设备，测量了高红移星系的光学发射线比，并发现这些比值与红移、恒星质量和Hβ SFR有关。与模型的比较表明，这些趋势与低金属丰度和高电离在低质量和高SFR的星系一致，并为我们对星系的演化提供了重要线索。 <div>
We use James Webb Space Telescope Near-Infrared Camera Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (NIRCam WFSS) and the Near-Infrared spectrograph (NIRSpec) in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release survey to measure rest-frame optical emission-line ratios of 155 galaxies at z > 2. The blind NIRCam grism observations include a sample of galaxies with bright emission lines that were not observed on the NIRSpec masks. We study the changes of the Hα, [O III]/Hβ, and [Ne III]/[O II] emission lines in terms of redshift by comparing to lower-redshift SDSS, CLEAR, and MOSDEF samples. We find a significant (>3σ) correlation between [O III]/Hβ with redshift, while [Ne III]/[O II] has a marginal (2σ) correlation with redshift. We compare [O III]/Hβ and [Ne III]/[O II] to stellar mass and Hβ SFR. We find that both emission-line ratios have a correlation with Hβ SFR and an anticorrelation with stellar mass across the redshifts 0 < z < 9. Comparison with MAPPINGS V models indicates that these trends are consistent with lower metallicity and higher ionization in low-mass and high-SFR galaxies. We additionally compare to IllustrisTNG predictions and find that they effectively describe the highest [O III]/Hβ ratios observed in our sample, without the need to invoke MAPPINGS models with significant shock ionization components.

总结:<br />
本研究调查了太阳高次声学模式频率和表面磁活动随着多个太阳周期的时空演变，以改进我们对太阳内部和大气之间联系的理解。研究着重于高次p模式，因其能够表征太阳表面下的剪切层条件，并分析了从全球振荡网络组织获取的22年振荡频率。考虑了10.7厘米射电通量测量、太阳黑子数和局部磁活动指数作为太阳活动的代理，发现模式频率与每个活动指数之间存在强烈的相关性。进一步研究了振荡频率和磁活动代理所关联的南半球和北半球的不对称性，并发现在第23个循环的下降阶段，这两者在南半球占主导地位，而在第24个循环中，这些量在南北半球之间波动。随着太阳循环的推进，分析了不同纬度的频率变化，发现在第24个循环的最大活跃期，中纬度处的变化在南半球占主导地位，但随着循环向最低阶段推进，这些数值开始重合。第25个循环初期的模式频率被发现在南半球占主导地位，遵循磁活动的模式。分析提供了额外证据，表明振荡频率的变化是由强磁场和弱磁场共同导致的。 <div>
We investigate the spatiotemporal evolution of high-degree acoustic-mode frequencies of the Sun and surface magnetic activity over the course of multiple solar cycles, to improve our understanding of the connection between the solar interior and atmosphere. We focus on high-degree p-modes due to their ability to characterize conditions in the shear layer just below the solar surface, and analyze 22 yr of oscillation frequencies obtained from the Global Oscillation Network Group. Considering 10.7 cm radio flux measurements, the sunspot number, and the local magnetic activity index as solar-activity proxies, we find strong correlation between the mode frequencies and each activity index. We further investigate the hemispheric asymmetry associated with oscillation frequencies and magnetic activity proxies, and find that both were dominant in the southern hemisphere during the descending phase of cycle 23, while in cycle 24 these quantities fluctuated between northern and southern hemispheres. Analyzing the frequencies at different latitudes with the progression of solar cycles, we observe that the variations at midlatitudes were dominant in the southern hemisphere during the maximum-activity period of cycle 24, but the values overlap as the cycle advances toward the minimum phase. The mode frequencies at the beginning of cycle 25 are found to be dominant in the southern hemisphere following the pattern of magnetic activity. The analysis provides added evidence that the variability in oscillation frequencies is caused by both strong and weak magnetic fields.

<div> CMEs, angular width, STEREO-A, in situ measurements, magnetic cloud-like signatures
<br /><br />总结:本文利用STEREO-A的观测数据，进行了两部分研究，以限制日冕物质抛射的角宽度。研究表明，在太阳与STEREO-A或地球之间传播的21次CME中，只有4次影响了两艘航天器，且没有一次提供了清晰的磁云状特征。综合两种方法，得出1天文单位处ME的典型角宽度约为20°–30°，比常规假设的2–3倍小，符合椭球形ME的2:1椭圆截面。文章讨论了这一发现对未来多航天器任务设计和CME的连贯性的影响。 <div>
Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large-scale eruptions with a typical radial size at 1 au of 0.21 au but their angular width in interplanetary space is still mostly unknown, especially for the magnetic ejecta (ME) part of the CME. We take advantage of STEREO-A angular separation of 20°–60° from the Sun–Earth line from 2020 October to 2022 August, and perform a two-part study to constrain the angular width of MEs in the ecliptic plane: (a) we study all CMEs that are observed remotely to propagate between the Sun–STEREO-A and the Sun–Earth lines and determine how many impact one or both spacecraft in situ, and (b) we investigate all in situ measurements at STEREO-A or at L1 of CMEs during the same time period to quantify how many are measured by the two spacecraft. A key finding is that out of 21 CMEs propagating within 30° of either spacecraft only four impacted both spacecraft and none provided clean magnetic cloud-like signatures at both spacecraft. Combining the two approaches, we conclude that the typical angular width of an ME at 1 au is ∼20°–30°, or 2–3 times less than often assumed and consistent with a 2:1 elliptical cross section of an ellipsoidal ME. We discuss the consequences of this finding for future multi-spacecraft mission designs and for the coherence of CMEs.

Accurate atomic data and plasma models are essential for interpreting the upcoming high-quality spectra from missions like XRISM and Athena. Estimating physical quantities, like temperature, abundance, turbulence, and the resonance scattering factor, is highly dependent on the underlying atomic data. We use the AtomDB tool variableapec to estimate the impact of atomic data uncertainties in Einstein A coefficients, collisional rate coefficients, and the ionization and recombination rates of H-, He-, and Li-like iron in modeling the spectrum of Perseus observed by Hitomi. The best-fit temperatures, abundances, resonance scattering factors, and turbulence parameters including atomic data uncertainties vary by approximately 17%, 35%, 30%, and 3%, respectively, from the best-fit temperatures, abundances, RS factors, and turbulence parameters estimated without atomic data uncertainties. These indicate that approximately 32%, 35%, and 25% of the best-fit temperatures, abundances, and resonance scattering factors when including uncertainties lie outside the 3σ error regions of their corresponding best-fit values computed with zero atomic data errors. Expanding the energy range to 1.8–20.0 keV shows less variability, with 26% of the abundances and 22% of the resonance scattering factors lying outside the 3σ errors of the best-fit values. We also studied correlations between physical parameters and atomic rate uncertainties to identify key atomic quantities requiring precise lab measurements. We report negative correlations between the best-fit temperatures and the z (1s2s 3S1 → 1s2) collisional rate coefficients, abundances and y (1s2p 3P1 → 1s2) collisional rate coefficients, and abundances and z collisional rate coefficients, and a positive correlation between the resonance scattering factors and the w (1s2p 1P1 → 1s2) collisional rate coefficients.

研究使用NOVA 1D流体动力学计算代码追踪氧-氖白矮星上热核逃逸的演化过程。他们先吸积太阳物质，然后切换到混合组成物。研究结果显示，氧-氖白矮星的经典新星爆发可能对铝26和锂7的产生有重要影响。此外，模拟预测了伽马射线辐射，并讨论了相关的天文现象。在所有模拟中，白矮星喷射的物质少于吸积的物质，因此预测白矮星由于经典新星爆发而增加质量。这表明氧-氖白矮星可能是促发引力坍缩事件的重要通道。<br /><br />总结: <div>
We report on studies of classical nova (CN) explosions where we follow the evolution of thermonuclear runaways (TNRs) on oxygen–neon (ONe) white dwarfs (WDs). Using NOVA, a 1D hydrodynamic computer code, we accrete solar matter until the TNR is ongoing and then switch to a mixed composition. This approach is guided by the results of multidimensional studies of TNRs in WDs, which find that sufficient mixing with WD core material occurs after the TNR is well underway, and levels of enrichment of the CNONeMg elements are reached that agree with observations of CN ejecta abundances. Because the amount of accreted material is inversely proportional to the oxygen abundance, by first accreting solar matter, the amount of accreted material is larger than in those simulations with an initially enriched composition. We vary the mass of the WD (from 0.6 M⊙ to 1.35 M⊙) and the composition of the mixed materials. Our results show large enrichments of 7Be in the ejected gases, implying that ONe CNe and CO CNe may be responsible for a significant fraction (∼100 M⊙) of the Galactic 7Li (∼1000 M⊙). The production of 22Na and 26Al in CN explosions and the γ-ray emission predicted by our simulations are discussed. The WDs in all our simulations eject less material than they accrete and we predict that the WD is growing in mass as a consequence of the CN outburst. ONe CNe, therefore, may be an important channel for accretion-induced collapse events.

总结:
本研究报告了2021年11月3日至5日太阳风暴期间，Solar Orbiter (SolO)和Wind两个太阳探测器对磁云进行了同时的原位观测。研究发现SolO和Wind测得的磁云内磁场和速度存在显著差异，表明即使是2.2°的角度差异也会对观测结果产生影响。另外，利用SolO测得的震波参数进行预测时，出现了2小时30分钟的预测误差。这些结果提示当前的太阳风暴模型分辨率可能存在问题，影响了预测能力。 <div>
Simultaneous in situ measurements of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), including both plasma and magnetic field, by two spacecraft in radial alignment have been extremely rare. Here, we report on one such CME measured by Solar Orbiter (SolO) and Wind on 2021 November 3–5, while the spacecraft were radially separated by a heliocentric distance of 0.13 au and angularly by only 2.2°. We focus on the magnetic cloud (MC) part of the CME. We find notable changes in the R and N magnetic field components and in the speed profiles inside the MC between SolO and Wind. We observe a greater speed at the spacecraft farther away from the Sun without any clear compression signatures. Since the spacecraft are close to each other and computing fast magnetosonic wave speed inside the MC, we rule out temporal evolution as the reason for the observed differences, suggesting that spatial variations over 2.2° of the MC structure are at the heart of the observed discrepancies. Moreover, using shock properties at SolO, we forecast an arrival time 2 hr 30 minutes too late for a shock that is just 5 hr 31 minutes away from Wind. Predicting the north–south component of the magnetic field at Wind from SolO measurements leads to a relative error of 55%. These results show that even angular separations as low as 2.2° (or 0.03 au in arc length) between spacecraft can have a large impact on the observed CME properties, which raises the issue of the resolutions of current CME models, potentially affecting our forecasting capabilities.

<title>Solar Tachocline Confinement by the Nonaxisymmetric Modes of a Dynamo Magnetic Field</title>

<div> 关键词: 3D numerical simulation, tachocline confinement, dynamo-generated magnetic field, solution regimes, solar tachocline confinement<br />
总结: <br />
该研究通过3D数值模拟首次实现了太阳内部的tachocline confinement，并发现了不同磁场强度下的三种解决方案。在弱场阈值中，大尺度磁场大部分是轴对称的，但无法创造一个confined tachocline。在强场阈值中，大尺度磁场大部分是非轴对称的，并创造了一个confined tachocline。在中等场阈值中，大尺度磁场在一定时间内类似于强场阈值，但间歇性地变弱，允许了强的差动旋转。无论在哪种阈值中，RZ中的极化场强度都可以很好地由皮肤深度参数解释。这些模拟结果提出了一个新的太阳tachocline confinement的图像，即通过与RZ旋转的非轴对称、非常长寿命(有效永久)的场结构来起主导作用，而不是与22年周期相关的定期反转的轴对称场。 <div>
We recently presented the first 3D numerical simulation of the solar interior for which tachocline confinement was achieved by a dynamo-generated magnetic field. In this follow-up study, we analyze the degree of confinement as the magnetic field strength changes (controlled by varying the magnetic Prandtl number) in a coupled radiative zone (RZ) and convection zone (CZ) system. We broadly find three solution regimes, corresponding to weak, medium, and strong dynamo magnetic field strengths. In the weak-field regime, the large-scale magnetic field is mostly axisymmetric with regular, periodic polarity reversals (reminiscent of the observed solar cycle) but fails to create a confined tachocline. In the strong-field regime, the large-scale field is mostly nonaxisymmetric with irregular, quasi-periodic polarity reversals and creates a confined tachocline. In the medium-field regime, the large-scale field resembles a strong-field dynamo for extended intervals but intermittently weakens to allow temporary epochs of strong differential rotation. In all regimes, the amplitude of poloidal field strength in the RZ is very well explained by skin-depth arguments, wherein the oscillating field that gives rise to the skin depth (in the medium- and strong-field cases) is a nonaxisymmetric field structure at the base of the CZ that rotates with respect to the RZ. These simulations suggest a new picture of solar tachocline confinement by the dynamo, in which nonaxisymmetric, very long-lived (effectively permanent) field structures rotating with respect to the RZ play the primary role, instead of the regularly reversing axisymmetric field associated with the 22 yr cycle.

<title>Deep Chandra Observation of the Remarkable Ionization Cones of NGC 5252</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Seyfert galaxy NGC 5252 harbors enormously extended ionization cones that have been previously detected in the optical and X-ray band, offering a unique opportunity to investigate the interaction between the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) and the surrounding gas in the AGN host galaxy. We present deep Chandra imaging spectroscopy of NGC 5252 with a total exposure time of 230 ks. The morphology in the soft X-rays shows resolved extended structure from the nucleus to a large radial distance, and for the first time we detect the outermost X-ray arc at ∼20 kpc. The X-ray cone mostly follows the direction of the optical ionization cones in the southeast and northwest directions, about 20° misaligned with the major axis of the galactic disk of NGC 5252. Fitting the spectra extracted from radial sectors with photoionization models supports that extended emission is mainly photoionized by the central AGN. We also examine the variation of the photoionization parameter along the radial extension and infer a decreasing ionizing continuum of the central engine by a factor of ∼50 over the past 64,000 yr. These findings are consistent with previous suggestions that NGC 5252 resembles a quasar relic with an M ∼ 109M⊙ supermassive black hole that went through a minor merger event and switched to a low accretion rate state.

<title>Absorption of Millimeter-band CO and CN in the Early Universe: Molecular Clouds in the Radio Galaxy B2 0902+34 at Redshift 3.4</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad198d</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, we have detected absorption lines due to carbon monoxide, CO(J = 0 → 1), and the cyano radical, CN(N = 0 → 1), associated with radio galaxy B2 0902+34 at redshift z = 3.4. The detection of millimeter-band absorption observed 1.5 Gyr after the Big Bang facilitates studying molecular clouds down to gas masses inaccessible to emission-line observations. The CO absorption in B2 0902+34 has a peak optical depth of τ ≥ 8.6% and consists of two components, one of which has the same redshift as previously detected 21 cm absorption of neutral hydrogen (H i) gas. Each CO component traces an integrated H2 column density of ≳ 3 × 1020 cm−2. CN absorption is detected for both CO components, as well as for a blueshifted component not detected in CO, with CO/CN line ratios ranging from ≲0.4 to 2.4. We discuss the scenario that the absorption components originate from collections of small and dense molecular clouds that are embedded in a region with more diffuse gas and high turbulence, possibly within the influence of the central active galactic nucleus or a starburst region. The degree of reddening in B2 0902+34, with rest-frame color B − K ∼ 4.2, is lower than the very red colors (B − K > 6) found among other known redshifted CO absorption systems at z < 1. Nevertheless, when including the many nondetections from the literature, a potential correlation between the absorption-line strength and B − K color is evident, giving weight to the argument that the red colors of CO absorbers are due to a high dust content.

<title>Heliospheric Diffusion of Stochastic Parker Spirals in Radially Evolving Solar Wind Turbulence</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad19dd</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a stochastic field line mapping model where the interplanetary magnetic field lines are described by a density distribution function satisfying a Fokker–Planck equation that is solved numerically. Due to the spiral geometry of the nominal Parker field and to the evolving nature of solar wind turbulence, the heliospheric diffusion of the magnetic field lines is both heterogeneous and anisotropic, including a radial component. The longitudinal distributions of the magnetic field lines are shown to be close to circular Gaussian distributions, although they develop a noticeable skewness. The magnetic field lines emanating from the Sun are found to differ, on average, from the spirals predicted by Parker. Although the spirals remain close to Archimedean, they are here underwound, on average. Our model predicts a spiral angle that is smaller by ∼5° than the Parker spiral angle at Earth’s orbit for the same solar wind speed of Vsw = 400 km s−1. It also predicts an angular position on the solar disk of the best magnetically connected footpoint to an observer at 1 au that is shifted westward by ∼10° with respect to the Parker’s field model. This significantly changes the angle of the most probable magnetic connection between possible sources on the Sun and observers in the inner heliosphere. The results have direct implications for the heliospheric transport of “scatter-free” electrons accelerated in the aftermath of solar eruptions.

<title>Ultra–short-period WD Binaries Are Not Undergoing Strong Tidal Heating</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1dd6</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1dd6</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Double white dwarf (WD) binaries are increasingly being discovered at short orbital periods where strong tidal effects and significant tidal heating signatures may occur. We assume that the tidal potential of the companion excites outgoing gravity waves within the WD primary, the dissipation of which leads to an increase in the WD’s surface temperature. We compute the excitation and dissipation of the waves in cooling WD models in evolving MESA binary simulations. Tidal heating is self-consistently computed and added to the models at every time step. As a binary inspirals to orbital periods less than ∼20 minutes, the WD’s behavior changes from cooling to heating, with temperature enhancements that can exceed 10,000 K compared with nontidally heated models. We compare a grid of tidally heated WD models to observed short-period systems with hot WD primaries. While tidal heating affects their Teff, it is likely not the dominant luminosity. Instead, these WDs are probably intrinsically young and hot, implying that the binaries formed at short orbital periods. The binaries are consistent with undergoing common envelope evolution with a somewhat low efficiency αCE. We delineate the parameter space where the traveling wave assumption is most valid, noting that it breaks down for WDs that cool sufficiently, where standing waves may instead be formed.

<title>The Energy-dependent Gamma-Ray Light Curves and Spectra of the Vela Pulsar in the Dissipative Magnetospheres</title>

We study the pulsar energy-dependent γ-ray light curves and spectra from curvature radiation in the dissipative magnetospheres. The dissipative magnetospheres with the combined force-free (FFE) and Aristotelian are computed by a pseudo-spectral method with a high-resolution simulation in the rotating coordinate system, which produces a near-FFE field structure with the dissipative region only near the equatorial current sheet outside the light cylinder. We use the test-particle trajectory method to compute the energy-dependent γ-ray light curves and phase-average and phase-resolved spectra by including both the accelerating electric field and radiation reaction. The predicted energy-dependent γ-ray light curves and spectra are then compared with those of the Vela pulsar observed by Fermi. Our results can generally reproduce the observed trends of the energy-dependent γ-ray light curves and spectra for the Vela pulsar.

<title>Polarization Leakage and the IXPE Point-spread Function</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
By measuring photoelectron tracks, the gas pixel detectors of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer satellite provide estimates of the photon detection location and its electric vector position angle (EVPA). However, imperfections in reconstructing event positions blur the image, and EVPA-position correlations result in artificial polarized halos around bright sources. We introduce a new model describing this “polarization leakage” and use it to recover the on-orbit telescope point-spread functions, useful for faint-source detection and image reconstruction. These point-spread functions are more accurate than previous approximations or ground-calibrated products (Δχ2 ≈ 3 × 104 and 4 × 104 respectively for a bright 106-count source). We also define an algorithm for polarization leakage correction substantially more accurate than existing prescriptions (Δχ2 ≈ 1 × 103). These corrections depend on the reconstruction method, and we supply prescriptions for the mission-standard “Moments” methods as well as for “Neural Net” event reconstruction. Finally, we present a method to isolate leakage contributions to polarization observations of extended sources and show that an accurate PSF allows the extraction of sub-PSF-scale polarization patterns.

<title>Simulating Compressive Stream Interaction Regions during Parker Solar Probe’s First Perihelion Using Stream-aligned Magnetohydrodynamics</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We used the stream-aligned magnetohydrodynamics (SA-MHD) model to simulate Carrington rotation 2210, which contains Parker Solar Probe’s (PSP) first perihelion at 36.5 R⊙ on 2018 November 6, to provide context to the in situ PSP observations by FIELDS and SWEAP. The SA-MHD model aligns the magnetic field with the velocity vector at each point, thereby allowing for clear connectivity between the spacecraft and the source regions on the Sun, without unphysical magnetic field structures. During this Carrington rotation, two stream interaction regions (SIRs) form, due to the deep solar minimum. We include the energy partitioning of the parallel and perpendicular ions and the isotropic electrons to investigate the temperature anisotropy through the compression regions to better understand the wave energy amplification and proton thermal energy partitioning in a global context. Overall, we found good agreement in all in situ plasma parameters between the SA-MHD results and the observations at PSP, STEREO-A, and Earth, including at PSP’s perihelion and through the compression region of the SIRs. In the typical solar wind, the parallel proton temperature is preferentially heated, except in the SIR, where there is an enhancement in the perpendicular proton temperature. This is further showcased in the ion cyclotron relaxation time, which shows a distinct decrease through the SIR compression regions. This work demonstrates the success of the Alfvén wave turbulence theory for predicting interplanetary magnetic turbulence levels, while self-consistently reproducing solar wind speeds, densities, and overall temperatures, including at small heliocentric distances and through SIR compression regions.

Numerous structures conducive to magnetic reconnection are frequently observed in the turbulent regions at quasi-parallel shocks. In this work, we use a particle-in-cell simulation to study 3D magnetic reconnection in shock turbulence. We identify and characterize magnetic null points, and focus on reconnection along the separator between them. We identify a reconnection region with strong parallel current, a finite parallel potential, and counterrotating electron flows. Electrons are shown to be accelerated by the parallel electric field before being scattered at the null.

Galaxy morphologies provide valuable insights into their formation processes, tracing the spatial distribution of ongoing star formation and encoding signatures of dynamical interactions. While such information has been extensively investigated at low redshift, it is crucial to develop a robust system for characterizing galaxy morphologies at earlier cosmic epochs. Relying solely on nomenclature established for low-redshift galaxies risks introducing biases that hinder our understanding of this new regime. In this paper, we employ variational autoencoders to perform feature extraction on galaxies at z > 2 using JWST/NIRCam data. Our sample comprises 6869 galaxies at z > 2, including 255 galaxies at z > 5, which have been detected in both the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey Hubble Space Telescope fields and the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey done with JWST, ensuring reliable measurements of redshift, mass, and star formation rates. To address potential biases, we eliminate galaxy orientation and background sources prior to encoding the galaxy features, thereby constructing a physically meaningful feature space. We identify 11 distinct morphological classes that exhibit clear separation in various structural parameters, such as the concentration, asymmetry, and smoothness (CAS) metric and M20, Sérsic indices, specific star formation rates, and axis ratios. We observe a decline in the presence of spheroidal-type galaxies with increasing redshift, indicating the dominance of disk-like galaxies in the early Universe. We demonstrate that conventional visual classification systems are inadequate for high-redshift morphology classification and advocate the need for a more detailed and refined classification scheme. Leveraging machine-extracted features, we propose a solution to this challenge and illustrate how our extracted clusters align with measured parameters, offering greater physical relevance compared to traditional methods.

We combine deep imaging data from the CEERS early release JWST survey and Hubble Space Telescope imaging from CANDELS to examine the size–mass relation of star-forming galaxies and the morphology–quenching relation at stellar masses M⋆ ≥ 109.5M⊙ over the redshift range 0.5 < z < 5.5. In this study with a sample of 2450 galaxies, we separate star-forming and quiescent galaxies based on their star formation activity and confirm that star-forming and quiescent galaxies have different morphologies out to z = 5.5, extending the results of earlier studies out to higher redshifts. We find that star-forming and quiescent galaxies have typical Sérsic indices of n ∼ 1.3 and n ∼ 4.3, respectively. Focusing on star-forming galaxies, we find that the slope of the size–mass relation is nearly constant with redshift, as was found previously, but shows a modest increase at z ∼ 4.2. The intercept in the size–mass relation declines out to z = 5.5 at rates that are similar to what earlier studies found. The intrinsic scatter in the size–mass relation is relatively constant out to z = 5.5.

该研究利用哈勃空间望远镜对六个红移为z ∼ 4–5的强引力透镜引发的Lyα发射体（LAEs）进行了研究。通过高分辨率的Lyα成像以及镜片放大技术，探测到了红移处无法直接获取的亚星系尺度。研究结果表明，这些LAEs具有较小的恒星质量（∼108–109M⊙）、年龄较年轻（t50 < 40 Myr）、几乎无尘埃（AV ∼ 0.1–0.6，统计学上等于零）的特征。此外，发现LAEs的Lyα形态存在两种模式：颗粒状和扩展状，呈现出与年龄的可能相关性。研究还发现Lyα和恒星连续体之间的偏移很小（<0.″1），并且与低红移LAEs的研究结果一致，表明这些星系并未相互作用或并合。

We present six strongly gravitationally lensed Lyα emitters (LAEs) at z ∼ 4–5 with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) narrowband imaging isolating Lyα. Through complex radiative transfer Lyα encodes information about the spatial distribution and kinematics of the neutral hydrogen upon which it scatters. We investigate the galaxy properties and Lyα morphologies of our sample. Many previous studies of high-redshift LAEs have been limited in Lyα spatial resolution. In this work we take advantage of high-resolution Lyα imaging boosted by lensing magnification, allowing us to probe subgalactic scales that are otherwise inaccessible at these redshifts. We use broadband imaging from HST (rest-frame UV) and Spitzer (rest-frame optical) in spectral energy distribution fitting, providing estimates of the stellar masses (∼108–109M⊙), stellar population ages (t50 < 40 Myr), and amounts of dust (AV ∼ 0.1–0.6, statistically consistent with zero). We employ nonparametric star formation histories to probe the young stellar populations which create the Lyα. We also examine the offsets between the Lyα and stellar continuum, finding small upper limits of offsets (<0.″1) consistent with studies of low-redshift LAEs, indicating our galaxies are not interacting or merging. Finally, we find a bimodality in our sample’s Lyα morphologies: clumpy and extended. We find a suggestive trend: our LAEs with clumpy Lyα are generally younger than the LAEs with extended Lyα, suggesting a possible correlation with age.

We present the kinematic analysis of 246 stars within from the center of Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), the closest massive star cluster with active star formation across the full mass range, which provides valuable insights in the formation and evolution of star cluster on an individual-star basis. High-precision radial velocities and surface temperatures are retrieved from spectra acquired by the NIRSPEC instrument used with adaptive optics (NIRSPAO) on the Keck II 10 m telescope. A 3D kinematic map is then constructed by combining with the proper motions previously measured by the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys/WFPC2/WFC3IR and Keck II NIRC2. The measured root-mean-squared velocity dispersion is 2.26 ± 0.08 km s−1, significantly higher than the virial equilibrium’s requirement of 1.73 km s−1, suggesting that the ONC core is supervirial, consistent with previous findings. Energy equipartition is not detected in the cluster. Most notably, the velocity of each star relative to its neighbors is found to be negatively correlated with stellar mass. Low-mass stars moving faster than their surrounding stars in a supervirial cluster suggests that the initial masses of forming stars may be related to their initial kinematic states. Additionally, a clockwise rotation preference is detected. A weak sign of inverse mass segregation is also identified among stars excluding the Trapezium stars, although it could be a sample bias. Finally, this study reports the discovery of four new candidate spectroscopic binary systems.

总结: 
本研究利用中国“天庭计划”的旗舰仪器——道孚太阳射电望远镜阵列的无线频谱观测数据，针对2022年4月17日的一次太阳射电暴进行了研究。通过对频谱漂移速度的分析，确定了相关冲击波的初速度。基于此，考虑到冲击波在活塞驱动阶段的稳定速度，再通过行星间空间传播作为爆轰波的方式来估计了相关冲击波到达STEREO-A观测卫星轨道的传播和到达时间。预测显示，冲击波在2022年4月19日14:31:57 UT到达STEREO-A。而STEREO-A卫星在同一天13:52:12 UT检测到了行星间冲击波。预测和实际到达时间的偏差仅为0.66小时。本研究旨在建立一个通用的预测方法，该方法可以利用地面太阳射电光谱仪或类似DSRT的望远镜观测数据，预测未来更多的事件。<br /><br /> <div>
Since fast head-on coronal mass ejections and their associated shocks represent potential hazards to the space environment of the Earth and even other planets, forecasting the arrival time of the corresponding interplanetary shock is a priority in space weather research and prediction. Based on the radio spectrum observations of the 16-element array of the Daocheng Solar Radio Telescope (DSRT), the flagship instrument of the Meridian Project of China, during its construction, this study determines the initial shock speed of a type II solar radio burst on 2022 April 17 from its drifting speed in the spectrum. Assuming that the shock travels at a steady speed during the piston-driven phase (determined from the X-ray flux of the associated flare) and then propagates through interplanetary space as a blast wave, we estimate the propagation and arrival time of the corresponding shock at the orbit of the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory-A (STEREO-A). The prediction shows that the shock will reach STEREO-A at 14:31:57 UT on 2022 April 19. The STEREO-A satellite detected an interplanetary shock at 13:52:12 UT on the same day. The discrepancy between the predicted and observed arrival time of the shock is only 0.66 hr. The purpose of this paper is to establish a general method for predicting the shock’s propagation and arrival time from this example, which will be utilized to predict more events in the future based on the observations of ground-based solar radio spectrometers or telescopes like DSRT.

总结:
本研究探讨了受霍尔效应影响的尘埃和磁化盘的稳定性以及对行星形成的影响。通过线性分析和非线性模拟，我们发现了一种新的背景漂移霍尔不稳定性（BDHI），它可能有助于在受霍尔效应影响的盘区形成行星。我们还发现在低尘埃气比和弱磁场下，BDHI可能占据主导地位，超过了经典的流动不稳定性（SI）和标准MHD不稳定性。我们还识别了经典SI的磁化版本，但这些通常是次要的。这突显了磁场和尘埃气动力学在原行星盘中的复杂相互作用，强调了在行星形成的更广泛叙事中考虑霍尔效应等非理想MHD的必要性。 <div>
Recent studies have shown that the large-scale gas dynamics of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) are controlled by nonideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), but how this influences dust dynamics is not fully understood. To this end, we investigate the stability of dusty, magnetized disks subject to the Hall effect, which applies to planet-forming regions of PPDs. We find a novel background drift Hall instability (BDHI) that may facilitate planetesimal formation in Hall-effected disk regions. Through a combination of linear analysis and nonlinear simulations, we demonstrate the viability and characteristics of BDHI. We find it can potentially dominate over the classical streaming instability (SI) and standard MHD instabilities at low dust-to-gas ratios and weak magnetic fields. We also identify magnetized versions of the classic SI, but these are usually subdominant. We highlight the complex interplay between magnetic fields and dust-gas dynamics in PPDs, underscoring the need to consider nonideal MHD like the Hall effect in the broader narrative of planet formation.

该文章介绍了层次贝叶斯推断如何同时考虑天文目录中的测量不确定性和选择效应。层次结构编码了关于生成观测数据的物理过程相互依赖的信念。文章指出文献中提出的几种近似方法实际上导致了与任何物理检测过程都不兼容的推断。这通常会导致偏见，并且与这样一个假设相关联：在真实源参数给定的情况下，可检测性与观测数据无关。文章还指出了这种错误如何影响了通过引力波观测到的双星并合事件目录进行的天体物理推断，包括错误估计并合率的红移演化以及错误地推断广义相对论是正确的引力理论。总的来说，不能直接拟合“检测分布”，然后在后处理中“排除”选择效应。同样，当比较理论预测和观测时，最好模拟检测到的数据（包括测量噪声和选择效应），而不是比较事件参数检测分布的估计（只包括选择效应）。尽管由于模型错误假设引起的偏差可能小于中等目录大小（O(100)事件）的统计不确定性，但它们仍将构成精密测量天体群体的重大障碍。<br /><br />总结: 本文讨论了层次贝叶斯推断在考虑天文目录中不确定性和选择效应方面的重要性，并强调了模型错误假设引起的偏差对于天体群体的影响。文章重点指出了在观测数据的理论预测和观测数据比较时应该考虑模拟检测到的数据以及不应该直接拟合“检测分布”来避免偏差的产生。 <div>
Hierarchical Bayesian inference can simultaneously account for both measurement uncertainty and selection effects within astronomical catalogs. In particular, the imposed hierarchy encodes beliefs about the interdependence of the physical processes that generate the observed data. We show that several proposed approximations within the literature actually correspond to inferences that are incompatible with any physical detection process. This generically leads to biases and is associated with the assumption that detectability is independent of the observed data given the true source parameters. We show several examples of how this error can affect astrophysical inferences based on catalogs of coalescing binaries observed through gravitational waves, including misestimating the redshift evolution of the merger rate as well as incorrectly inferring that general relativity is the correct theory of gravity when it is not. In general, one cannot directly fit for the “detected distribution” and “divide out” the selection effects in post-processing. Similarly, when comparing theoretical predictions to observations, it is better to simulate detected data (including both measurement noise and selection effects) rather than comparing estimates of the detected distributions of event parameters (which include only selection effects). While the biases introduced by model misspecification from incorrect assumptions may be smaller than statistical uncertainty for moderate catalog sizes (O(100) events), they will nevertheless pose a significant barrier to precision measurements of astrophysical populations.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究通过对SOHO卫星观测得到的HCME目录的分析，发现HCME的来源位置受太阳活动带的限制，并不存在磁活动“冲向极地”的现象。HCME的来源位置呈现一般的半球不对称性，并且与太阳黑子活动的不对称性存在显著差异。第24太阳周期的半球分布与第23太阳周期不同，可能是由于在第23太阳周期极性反转后，太阳风动压显著减小导致的。这些结果有助于更全面地理解高能磁结构的半球不对称性，并为理解HCME的地球效应提供了新的视角。 <div>
The hemispheric asymmetry of solar activity is one of the essential physical consequences of the interior dynamo process. However, the hemispheric distribution of halo coronal mass ejection (HCME) source locations has not been investigated in detail. Based on the HCME catalog identified from the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph Experiment on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, we perform a hemispheric distribution analysis of the HCME source locations from 1996 April to 2022 June. The main results are as follows. (1) The HCME source locations are confined to the active region belt, and there is no “rush to the poles” phenomenon that is unique to large-scale magnetic activity. (2) The HCME source locations exhibit a general hemispheric asymmetry, and autoregressive moving-average model results show that the asymmetry of HCME source locations is significantly different from that of sunspot activity. (3) The hemispheric distribution of cycle 24 is different from that of cycle 23, potentially as a result of the heliospheric dynamic pressure having noticeably decreased after the polarity reversal of cycle 23. Our results contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the hemispheric asymmetry of energetic magnetic structures and give a new perspective on understanding the geoeffectiveness of HCMEs.

总结: 本研究旨在探讨不同磁场外推模型对分析太阳活跃区形态参数在三维空间中的重要性，并提出多种预测参数用于改进太阳爆发的预测。研究发现，使用多种磁场外推模型对太阳活跃区进行建模可以获得相似的形态参数演变趋势，并在预爆发条件方面取得了一定的成效。同时，研究结果表明，在下层太阳大气中应用多种前体参数可以提高对太阳爆发的预测能力，而在3D太阳活跃区的快速可靠洞察方面，PF和LFFF方法是可接受的选择，而NF2方法更为合适。 <div>
The three-dimensional (3D) coronal magnetic field has not yet been directly observed. However, for a better understanding and prediction of magnetically driven solar eruptions, 3D models of solar active regions are required. This work aims to provide insight into the significance of different extrapolation models for analyzing the preeruptive conditions of active regions with morphological parameters in 3D. Here, we employed potential field (PF), linear force-free field (LFFF), and nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) models and a neural network-based method integrating observational data and NLFFF physics (NF2). The 3D coronal magnetic field structure of a “flaring” (AR11166) and “flare-quiet” (AR12645) active region, in terms of their flare productivity, is constructed via the four extrapolation methods. To analyze the evolution of the field, six prediction parameters were employed throughout, from the photosphere up to the base of the lower corona. First, we find that the evolution of the adopted morphological parameters exhibits similarity across the investigated time period when considering the four types of extrapolations. Second, all the parameters exhibited preeruptive conditions not only at the photosphere but also at higher altitudes in the case of active region (AR) 11166, while three out of the six proxies also exhibited preeruptive conditions in the case of AR12645. We conclude that: (i) the combined application of several different precursor parameters is important in the lower solar atmosphere to improve eruption predictions, and (ii) to gain a quick yet reliable insight into the preflare evolution of active regions in 3D, the PF and LFFF are acceptable; however, the NF2 method is likely the more suitable option.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章报告了对壳状超新星遗迹G32.4+0.1的深入Chandra观测结果。研究发现了部分壳状形态，其轮廓相当圆形，半径约11光年。经过分析，证实了X射线来自非热源，即同步辐射。所需的冲击波速度表明遗迹的年龄大约在5000-9000年之间。此外，未发现X射线与射电脉冲星PSR J1850−0026之间的明显对应关系。然而，其位置与X射线辐射区域相接，可能是脉冲星风星云（PWN）。最后，对于非热辐射的起源仍存在问题，因为脉冲星与壳状超新星遗迹的关联性值得怀疑。 <div>
We present a deep Chandra observation of the shell supernova remnant (SNR) G32.4+0.1, whose featureless X-ray spectrum has led to its classification as an X-ray synchrotron-dominated SNR. We find a partial shell morphology whose outline is quite circular, with a radius of about 11 pc at an assumed distance of 11 kpc. Thermal and power-law spectral models for three relatively bright regions provided equally good fits, but the absence of spectral lines required ionization timescales from thermal fits that are inconsistent with the mean densities derived from emission measures. We thus confirm the nonthermal, i.e., synchrotron, origin of X-rays from G32.4+0.1. Shock velocities needed to accelerate electrons to the required TeV energies are ≳1000 km s−1, giving a remnant age ≲ 5000–9000 yr. There is no obvious X-ray counterpart to the radio pulsar PSR J1850−0026, but its position adjoins a region of X-ray emission whose spectrum is somewhat harder than that of other regions of the shell, and which may be a pulsar-wind nebula (PWN), though its spectrum is steeper than almost all known X-ray PWNe. The distance of the pulsar from the center of symmetry of the shell disfavors a birth in a supernova event at that location only a few thousand years before; either the pulsar (and putative PWN) are not associated with the shell SNR, requiring a coincidence of both position and (roughly) absorbing column density, or the SNR is much older, making the origin of nonthermal emission problematic.

Based on the Heliospheric Imager-1 images of the STEREO twin spacecraft, we established the CORrelation-Aided Reconstruction (CORAR) technique to locate and reconstruct the 3D structures of solar wind transients in interplanetary space. Here, we extend the CORAR method to images of COR2 on board STEREO to study the evolution of small-scale transients in the outer corona from 2010 January to May. We confirm that the transients can be located and reconstructed well by comparing the results with those of a self-similar expanding model. The speed distribution of the reconstructed transients generally shows the typical characteristics of the slow solar wind. We further study the sources of the transients on the Sun, and find that most reconstructed transients are located near the top of streamer belts or the heliospheric current sheet and can be tracked back to the boundaries of the closed-field and open-field regions along the field lines extrapolated by corona models. The formation mechanisms of these transients in the slow solar wind are also discussed.

We report JWST/NIRSpec spectra of three distant T-type brown dwarfs identified in the Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) survey of the Abell 2744 lensing field. One source was previously reported as a candidate T dwarf on the basis of NIRCam photometry, while two sources were initially identified as candidate active galactic nuclei. Low-resolution 1–5 μm spectra confirm the presence of molecular features consistent with T dwarf atmospheres, and comparison to spectral standards infers classifications of sdT1, T6, and T8–T9. The warmest source, UNCOVER-BD-1, shows evidence of subsolar metallicity, and atmosphere model fits indicate Teff = 1300 K and [M/H] ∼ −1.0, making this one of the few spectroscopically confirmed T subdwarfs known. The coldest source, UNCOVER-BD-3, is near the T/Y dwarf boundary with Teff = 550 K, and our analysis indicates the presence of PH3 in the 3–5 μm region, favored over CO2 and a possible indicator of subsolar metallicity. We estimate distances of 0.9–4.5 kpc from the Galactic midplane, making these the most distant brown dwarfs with spectroscopic confirmation. Population simulations indicate high probabilities of membership in the Galactic thick disk for two of these brown dwarfs, and potential halo membership for UNCOVER-BD-1. Our simulations indicate that there are approximately 5 T dwarfs and 1–2 L dwarfs in the Abell 2744 field down to F444W = 30 AB mag, roughly one-third of which are thick disk members. These results highlight the utility of deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy for identifying and characterizing the oldest metal-poor brown dwarfs in the Milky Way.

Multiwavelength observations are now the norm for studying blazars’ various states of activity, classifying them, and determining the possible underlying physical processes driving their emission. Broadband emission models became unavoidable tools for testing emission scenarios and setting the values of physical quantities such as the magnetic field strength, Doppler factor, or shape of the particle distribution of the emission zone(s). We announce here the first public release of a new tool, Bjet_MCMC, that can automatically fit the broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of blazars. The complete code is available on GitHub and allows for testing leptonic synchrotron self-Compton models with or without external inverse-Compton processes from the thermal environment of supermassive black holes (accretion disk and broad-line region). The code is designed to be user-friendly and computationally efficient. It contains a core written in C++ and a fully parallelized SED fitting method. The original multi-SSC zone model of Bjet is also available on GitHub but is not included in the Markov Chain Monte Carlo fitting process at the moment. We present the features, performance, and results of Bjet_MCMC, as well as user advice.

这项研究使用三维流体力学模拟研究了一个正在发展为红超巨星的16M⊙恒星与一个4M⊙主序伴星的合并过程。合并导致了大约0.6M⊙的物质被不对称和有些双极的喷射。研究还展示了合并后的恒星表面旋转速度与Betelgeuse相似，并且在H-R图中演化的化学成分也相似。这个开创性的研究旨在模拟恒星合并跨越关键时间尺度，包括动力学、热力学和核融合演化阶段。<br /><br />总结: 这项研究使用三维流体力学模拟研究了一个16M⊙的恒星与4M⊙的伴星的合并过程，发现合并释放了大量物质，并且合并后的恒星表面旋转速度与化学成分与已知的Betelgeuse相似。这项开创性的研究旨在全面模拟恒星合并的各个阶段。 <div>
We investigate the merger between a 16M⊙ star, on its way to becoming a red supergiant (RSG), and a 4M⊙ main-sequence companion. Our study employs three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations using the state-of-the-art adaptive mesh refinement code Octo-Tiger. The initially corotating binary undergoes interaction and mass transfer, resulting in the accumulation of mass around the companion and its subsequent loss through the second Lagrangian point (L2). The companion eventually plunges into the envelope of the primary, leading to its spin-up and subsequent merger with the helium core. We examine the internal structural properties of the post-merger star, as well as the merger environment and the outflow driven by the merger. Our findings reveal the ejection of approximately ∼0.6 M⊙ of material in an asymmetric and somewhat bipolar outflow. We import the post-merger stellar structure into the MESA stellar evolution code to model its long-term nuclear evolution. In certain cases, the post-merger star exhibits persistent rapid equatorial surface rotation as it evolves in the H–R diagram toward the observed location of Betelgeuse. These cases demonstrate surface rotation velocities of a similar magnitude to those observed in Betelgeuse, along with a chemical composition resembling that of Betelgeuse. In other cases, efficient rotationally induced mixing leads to slower surface rotation. This pioneering study aims to model stellar mergers across critical timescales, encompassing dynamical, thermal, and nuclear evolutionary stages.

总结: 
Green Bank North Celestial Cap survey是最大、最敏感的脉冲星和瞬变射电天体的调查之一，已完成观测，重点转向对其发现进行长期监测。研究团队开发了一个处理大型归档观测数据集的管道，并将其与近期使用Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment望远镜进行的高频率观测相连接。他们处理了128颗脉冲星的数据，并测量了自旋、位置和轨道参数，连接了长达2000天的观测间隔。此外，他们还测量了五颗脉冲星的时间残差中的瞬变以及19颗源的proper motion。他们还更新了19颗脉冲星的轨道参数，包括九颗以前未发表的二元系统。对于其中两个二元系统，他们提供了更精确的后开普勒参数测量，从而更准确地估计了两个系统的总质量。对于PSR J0509+3801，他们大大改善了爱因斯坦延迟的测量结果，得到了脉冲星和伴星的质量分别为1.399(6) M⊙和1.412(6) M⊙的更精确测量。对于这个系统，他们还获得了由于引力波辐射而导致的轨道衰减的测量结果，与这些质量的广义相对论预测的速率一致。 <br /><br />总结: 这项研究使用大数据处理技术处理了脉冲星的观测数据，更新了它们的参数并发现了新的二元系统。对于PSR J0509+3801这个系统，获得了更准确的质量测量和引力波辐射速率的测量结果。 <div>
The Green Bank North Celestial Cap survey is one of the largest and most sensitive searches for pulsars and transient radio objects. Observations for the survey have finished; priorities have shifted toward long-term monitoring of its discoveries. In this study, we have developed a pipeline to handle large data sets of archival observations and connect them to recent, high-cadence observations taken using the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment telescope. This pipeline handles data for 128 pulsars and has produced measurements of spin, positional, and orbital parameters that connect data over observation gaps as large as 2000 days. We have also measured glitches in the timing residuals for five of the pulsars included and proper motion for 19 sources (13 new). We include updates to orbital parameters for 19 pulsars, including nine previously unpublished binaries. For two of these binaries, we provide updated measurements of post-Keplerian binary parameters, which result in much more precise estimates of the total masses of both systems. For PSR J0509+3801, the much improved measurement of the Einstein delay yields much improved mass measurements for the pulsar and its companion, 1.399(6) M⊙ and 1.412(6) M⊙, respectively. For this system, we have also obtained a measurement of the orbital decay due to the emission of gravitational waves, , which is in agreement with the rate predicted by general relativity for these masses.

We present high-spectral-resolution M-band spectra from iSHELL on NASA’s Infrared Telescope Facility along the line of sight to the debris disk host star HD 32297. We also present a Gemini Planet Imager H-band polarimetric image of the HD 131488 debris disk. We search for fundamental CO absorption lines in the iSHELL spectra of HD 32297, but do not detect any. We place an upper limit on the CO column density of ∼6 × 1015 cm−2. By combining the column density upper limit, the CO mass measured with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and the geometrical properties of the disk, we estimate the scale height of the CO to be ≲2 au across the radial extent of the disk (∼80–120 au). We use the same method to estimate the CO scale height of three other edge-on, CO-rich debris disks that all have CO observed in absorption with the Hubble Space Telescope as well as in emission with ALMA: β Pictoris, HD 110058, and HD 131488. We compare our estimated CO scale heights of these four systems to the millimeter dust scale heights and find that, under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, there is a potential correlation between the CO and millimeter dust scale heights. There are multiple factors that affect the gas vertical structure such as turbulence, photodissociation with weak vertical mixing, as well as where the gas originates. One possible explanation for the potential correlation could be that the gas and dust are of a similar secondary origin in these four systems.

总结：

Under the assumption of a simple and time-invariant gravitational potential, many Galactic dynamics techniques infer the milky Way’s mass and dark matter distributions from stellar kinematic observations. These methods typically rely on parameterized potential models of the Galaxy and must take into account nontrivial survey selection effects, because they make use of the density of stars in phase space. Large-scale spectroscopic surveys now supply information beyond kinematics in the form of precise stellar label measurements (especially element abundances). These element abundances are known to correlate with orbital actions or other dynamical invariants. Here, we use the Orbital Torus Imaging framework that uses abundance gradients in phase space to map orbits. In many cases these gradients can be measured without detailed knowledge of the selection function. We use stellar surface abundances from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment survey combined with kinematic data from the Gaia mission. Our method reveals the vertical (z-direction) orbital structure in the Galaxy and enables empirical measurements of the vertical acceleration field and orbital frequencies in the disk. From these measurements, we infer the total surface mass density, Σ, and midplane volume density, ρ0, as a function of Galactocentric radius and height. Around the Sun, we find and using the most constraining abundance ratio, [Mg/Fe]. This corresponds to a dark matter contribution in surface density of Σ⊙,DM(z = 1.1 kpc) = 24 ± 4 M⊙ pc−2, and in total volume mass density of ρ⊙,DM(z = 0) = 0.011 ± 0.002 M⊙ pc−3. Moreover, using these mass density values we estimate the scale length of the low-α disk to be hR = 2.24 ± 0.06 kpc.

总结: 
Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)的观测结果使我们能够精确研究超大质量黑洞的吸积过程。文章利用基于动力学物理学的简单模型研究了螺旋度屏障对EHT可见的电磁观测量的影响。研究发现，螺旋度屏障在磁场更加有序的区域以及在MAD流域中可能会对辐射形态和电子温度产生显著影响。此外，忽略螺旋度屏障可能导致低估吸积率和射流功率。研究结果强调了螺旋度屏障在塑造黑洞可观测量和推断吸积系统参数方面的重要性。 <div>
Horizon-scale observations from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) have enabled precision study of supermassive black hole accretion. Contemporary accretion modeling often treats the inflowing plasma as a single, thermal fluid, but microphysical kinetic effects can lead to significant deviations from this idealized picture. We investigate how the helicity barrier influences EHT-accessible electromagnetic observables by employing a simple model for electron heating based on kinetic physics and the cascade of energy and helicity in unbalanced turbulence. Although the helicity barrier plays only a minor role in regions with high plasma β, like in standard and normal evolution (SANE) disks, it may substantially impact regions with more ordered magnetic fields, such as the jet and its surrounding wind in SANE flows as well as throughout the entire domain in magnetically arrested disk (MAD) flows. In SANE flows, emission shifts from the funnel wall toward the lower-magnetization disk region; in MAD flows the emission morphology remains largely unchanged. Including the helicity barrier leads to characteristically lower electron temperatures, and neglecting it can lead to underestimated accretion rates and inferred jet powers. The corresponding higher plasma densities result in increased depolarization and Faraday depths thereby decreasing the amplitude of the β2 coefficient while leaving its angle unchanged. Both the increased jet power and lower may help alleviate outstanding tensions between modeling and EHT observations. We also find that the estimated ring diameter may be underestimated when the helicity barrier is neglected. Our results underscore the significance of the helicity barrier in shaping black hole observables and inferred accretion system parameters.

<title>A Physically Motivated Framework to Compare Pair Fractions of Isolated Low- and High-mass Galaxies across Cosmic Time</title>

Low-mass galaxy pair fractions are understudied, and it is unclear whether low-mass pair fractions evolve in the same way as more massive systems over cosmic time. In the era of JWST, Roman, and Rubin, selecting galaxy pairs in a self-consistent way will be critical to connect observed pair fractions to cosmological merger rates across all mass scales and redshifts. Utilizing the Illustris TNG100 simulation, we create a sample of physically associated low-mass (108 < M* < 5 × 109M⊙) and high-mass (5 × 109 < M* < 1011M⊙) pairs between z = 0 and 4.2. The low-mass pair fraction increases from z = 0 to 2.5, while the high-mass pair fraction peaks at z = 0 and is constant or slightly decreasing at z > 1. At z = 0 the low-mass major (1:4 mass ratio) pair fraction is 4× lower than high-mass pairs, consistent with findings for cosmological merger rates. We show that separation limits that vary with the mass and redshift of the system, such as scaling by the virial radius of the host halo (rsep < 1Rvir), are critical for recovering pair fraction differences between low-mass and high-mass systems. Alternatively, static physical separation limits applied equivalently to all galaxy pairs do not recover the differences between low- and high-mass pair fractions, even up to separations of 300 kpc. Finally, we place isolated mass analogs of Local Group galaxy pairs, i.e., Milky Way (MW)–M31, MW–LMC, LMC–SMC, in a cosmological context, showing that isolated analogs of LMC–SMC-mass pairs and low-separation (<50 kpc) MW–LMC-mass pairs are 2–3× more common at z ≳ 2–3.

这篇文章报告了对阿贝尔1240的深度查德拉观测，该天体是一个红移为0.195的二元并合星系团，其中包括两个最亮的星系团星系，它们可能在0.3亿年前相互经过。研究集中在星团核心的西北和东南方向两个明显的广大射电残留物。研究利用了高分辨率的查德拉成像技术，确定了在星团中心西北1兆帕斯卡和东南1.2兆帕斯卡的两个明显的面亮度边缘，与两者的外缘完全一致。我们的温度测量表明这些边缘是冲击波边缘。从气体密度跳跃中求得的马赫数为SE冲击波为3.5，NW冲击波为3.8。我们估计的马赫数与从射电观测中获得的显著小，这突显了重新加速场景占主导地位，而不是直接加速来自热池的电子。此外，我们比较了两种模型对两个冲击波内外的观测温度剖面。两个冲击波都支持库仑碰撞模型，但由于预冲击温度不确定性，我们无法排除纯碰撞模型。 <br /><br />总结: 这篇文章描述了对星团Abell 1240的深度查德拉观测，发现了两个广大射电残留物，并确定了两个冲击波边缘。通过温度测量和马赫数计算，研究结果表明重新加速场景占据主导地位。此外，通过比较两种模型对观测温度剖面的预测，发现射电观测所得的马赫数明显高于碰撞模型预测的值。 <div>
We present a 368 ks deep Chandra observation of Abell 1240, a binary merging galaxy cluster at a redshift of 0.195 with two brightest cluster galaxies that may have passed each other 0.3 Gyr ago. Building upon previous investigations involving Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, Very Large Array, and LOFAR data, our study focuses on two prominent extended radio relics at the northwest (NW) and southeast (SE) of the cluster core. By leveraging the high-resolution Chandra imaging, we have identified two distinct surface-brightness edges at ∼1 Mpc and 1.2 Mpc NW and SE of the cluster center, respectively, coinciding with the outer edges of both relics. Our temperature measurements suggest the edges to be shock front edges. The Mach numbers, derived from the gas density jumps, yield = for the SE shock and = for the NW shock. Our estimated Mach numbers are remarkably smaller compared to those derived from radio observations ( = 2.3 and = 2.4), highlighting the prevalence of a reacceleration scenario over direct acceleration of electrons from the thermal pool. Furthermore, we compare the observed temperature profiles across both shocks with those of predictions from collisional versus collisionless models. Both shocks favor the Coulomb collisional model, but we could not rule out a purely collisionless model due to pre-shock temperature uncertainties.

The radial evolution of particles accelerated at corotating interaction regions (CIRs) is not fully understood, particularly the distance range over which this particle acceleration occurs and how the energy spectra are modulated by transport through the inner heliosphere. Here, we present observations of energetic proton enhancements associated with a CIR observed by Parker Solar Probe on 2021 April 25 during the inbound leg of its orbit near ∼46 Rs (∼0.21 au). The CIR is identified at additional spacecraft (Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, STEREO-A; Solar Orbiter, SolO; and Advanced Composition Explorer, ACE) using a corotation time delay estimation, and energetic proton spectra from each spacecraft are compared. We find that (1) energetic protons are observed near 46 Rs streaming sunward ahead of the CIR; (2) the CIR persists for at least one solar rotation and the corresponding energetic proton enhancements are observed at STEREO-A, SolO, and ACE; and (3) the proton energy spectrum is steeper near the Sun and hardens near 1 au. This observation presents the closest in situ energetic particle observation of a CIR to the Sun ever recorded. Results presented here suggest that particles can be accelerated by CIR structures within 1 au and these particles can penetrate very deep into the inner heliosphere.

While various methods have been proposed to disentangle the progenitor system for Type Ia supernovae, their origin is still unclear. A circumstellar environment is key to distinguishing between the double-degenerate and single-degenerate (SD) scenarios since a dense wind cavity is expected only in the case of the SD system. We perform spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy of Tycho’s supernova remnant (SNR) with XMM-Newton and reveal the three-dimensional velocity structure of the expanding shock-heated ejecta measured from Doppler-broadened lines of intermediate-mass elements. Obtained velocity profiles are fairly consistent with those expected from a uniformly expanding ejecta model near the center, whereas we discover a rapid deceleration (∼4000 to ∼1000 km s−1) near the edge of the remnant in almost every direction. The result strongly supports the presence of a dense wall entirely surrounding the remnant, which is confirmed also by our hydrodynamical simulation. We thus conclude that Tycho’s SNR is likely of SD origin. Our new method will be useful for understanding progenitor systems of Type Ia SNRs in the era of high-angular/energy-resolution X-ray astronomy with microcalorimeters.

Recent numerical studies suggest that magnetic fields play an important role in primordial star formation in the early Universe. However, the detailed evolution of the magnetic field in the collapse phase still has uncertainties because of the complicated physics associated with turbulence in a collapsing magnetized system. Here, we perform a suite of numerical MHD simulations that follow the collapse of magnetized, turbulent primordial gas clouds to investigate the evolution of the magnetic field associated with the turbulence, assuming a polytropic equation of state with exponent γeff and with various numerical resolutions. In addition, we generalize the analytic theory of magnetic field growth/saturation so that it can deal with various exponents γeff and turbulence energy spectra. We find that the numerical results are well reproduced by the theory for various γeff through the collapse phase during the formation of the first stars. The magnetic field is eventually amplified by a factor of 1012–1015 due to kinematic and nonlinear turbulent dynamo effects and reaches 3%–100% of the equipartition level, depending on γeff. We also find that the transition between the kinematic and nonlinear stages can be analytically estimated. These results indicate that the strong magnetic field accompanied by supersonic turbulence is a general property and suggest that it can play a crucial role in the formation of the first stars.

通过研究我们发现，围绕恒星运转快速的系外行星会在其大气层内产生大量的焦耳热，进而影响其大气层的逃逸速率。因此，在研究外行星大气层的长期演变过程时，需要考虑这一过程。总结: 外行星大气层在快速轨道运动中受到的焦耳热影响应予以重视。 <div>
Exoplanets with short orbit periods reside very close to their host stars. They transition very rapidly between different sectors of the circumstellar space environment along their orbit, leading to large variations of the magnetic field in the vicinity of the planet on short timescales. This rapid change of the magnetic flux through the conducting and resistive layer of the planetary upper atmosphere may drive currents that dissipate in the form of Joule heating (JH). Here, we estimate the amount of JH dissipation in the upper atmosphere of Trappist-1e, and two hypothetical planets orbiting the Sun in close-in orbits. We find that the rapid orbital motion could drive a significant amount of atmospheric heating and could significantly affect the planetary atmosphere escape rate. Thus, the process should be accounted for when studying the long-term evolution of exoplanetary atmospheres.

这篇文章探讨了宇宙时期内，星系和其超大质量黑洞是如何共同演化的。研究使用XMM-SERVS的数据，发现较小质量的AGN宿主星系具有增强的星形成率，而较大质量的AGN宿主星系则位于或低于星系的主序线上。另外，文章提出了一个经验模型，描述了AGN相对于主序线的位置是如何随着M⋆和LX的变化而演化的。这些发现对于了解星系和超大质量黑洞的演化关系具有重要意义。

A fundamental question in galaxy and black hole evolution remains how galaxies and their supermassive black holes have evolved together over cosmic time. Specifically, it is still unclear how the position of X-ray active galactic nucleus (AGN) host galaxies with respect to the star-forming main sequence (MS) may change with the X-ray luminosity (LX) of the AGN or the stellar mass (M⋆) of the host galaxy. We use data from the XMM-Spitzer Extragalactic Representative Volume Survey (XMM-SERVS) to probe this issue. XMM-SERVS is covered by the largest medium-depth X-ray survey (with superb supporting multiwavelength data) and thus contains the largest sample to date for study. To ensure consistency, we locally derive the MS from a large reference galaxy sample. In our analysis, we demonstrate that the turnover of the galaxy MS does not allow reliable conclusions to be drawn for high-mass AGNs, and we establish a robust safe regime where the results do not depend upon the choice of MS definition. Under this framework, our results indicate that less massive AGN host galaxies ( ) generally possess enhanced star formation rates compared to their normal-galaxy counterparts while the more massive AGN host galaxies ( ) lie on or below the star-forming MS. Further, we propose an empirical model for how the placement of an AGN with respect to the MS (SFRnorm) evolves as a function of both M⋆ and LX.

总结: 
本文探讨了利用Roman Space Telescope在M31和其他附近星系中观测到星流中的岛的可能性。通过模拟Palomar 5类星流中岛的形成，并使用M31的背景星和前景的银河星场进行观测模拟，评估了Roman望远镜在1000秒至1小时的曝光时间内，以10Mpc范围内探测到岛状结构的能力。结果显示，质量大于5×10^6M⊙的次哈洛球形星团生成的约1.5kpc的岛可以在外部星系中被探测到。这项研究对于暗物质模型的约束具有重要意义，未来大样本的星流岛现象观测将开启统计分析和暗物质模型研究的新时代。 <br /><br /> <div>
Stellar streams form through the tidal disruption of satellite galaxies or globular clusters orbiting a host galaxy. Globular cluster streams are exciting since they are thin (dynamically cold) and therefore sensitive to perturbations from low-mass subhalos. Since the subhalo mass function differs depending on the dark matter composition, these gaps can provide unique constraints on dark matter models. However, current samples are limited to the Milky Way. With its large field of view, deep imaging sensitivity, and high angular resolution, the upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) presents a unique opportunity to increase the number of observed streams and gaps significantly. This paper presents a first exploration of the prospects for detecting gaps in streams in M31 and other nearby galaxies with resolved stars. We simulate the formation of gaps in a Palomar 5–like stream and generate mock observations of these gaps with background stars in M31 and foreground Milky Way stellar fields. We assess Roman's ability to detect gaps out to 10 Mpc through visual inspection and with the gap-finding tool FindTheGap. We conclude that gaps of ≈1.5 kpc in streams that are created from subhalos of masses ≥5 × 106M⊙ are detectable within a 2–3 Mpc volume in exposure times of 1000 s to 1 hr. This volume contains ≈150 galaxies, including ≈eight galaxies with luminosities >109L⊙. Large samples of stream gaps in external galaxies will open up a new era of statistical analyses of gap characteristics in stellar streams and help constrain dark matter models.

<div> 黑洞、星团、质量分离、模拟、星体破坏
总结：<br /><br />这项研究关注了质量分离对星团内恶性破坏事件的影响。根据蒙特卡洛模拟，发现质量分离会导致重物质体聚集在中心黑洞附近，而轻物质体则过度集中在外围区域。研究还考虑了在黑洞附近星团内被破坏并注入的恒星对该过程的影响。模拟结果表明，这种质量分离对星体的破坏速率产生了自洽的影响，对于星团整体的演化具有重要意义。 <div>
The centers of galaxies host a supermassive black hole (SMBH) surrounded by a dense stellar cluster. The cluster is expected to develop mass segregation, in which gravitational scatterings among the stars cause heavier objects to sink closer to the central black hole, while lighter objects will tend to be overconcentrated in the outer regions. This work focuses on the implications of mass segregation on the different channels for violent destruction of stars in the cluster: tidal disruptions, gravitational-wave-driven inspirals and high-velocity destructive collisions between stars. All such events occur close to the central black hole, where the heavier objects congregate. The analysis is based on a simplified Monte Carlo simulation, which evolves a two-mass population in a cluster surrounding a Milky Way–like SMBH. The simulation is based on the single-mass scheme used by Sari & Fragione and Balberg & Yassur, which has been extended to allow for the dynamical friction effects typical of unequal-mass populations. The effects of mass segregation on the rates of the different destruction channels are analyzed self-consistently in the overall evolution of the cluster. Also considered are stars which are injected into the cluster after being disrupted from a binary system by the SMBH. Such stars are captured in the inner regions of the cluster, and so their orbital evolution, as well as their destruction rate, are therefore influenced by heavy objects that might be abundant in the vicinity of the SMBH.

<title>On the Evolutionary History of a Simulated Disk Galaxy as Seen by Phylogenetic Trees</title>

<div> Galaxies, Phylogenetic methods, Chemical abundances, Evolutionary history, Simulation<br />
总结:<br />
这篇文章讨论了如何将系统发育方法应用于模拟的盘状星系，以研究其演化历史。研究发现，至少需要100颗恒星颗粒才能可靠地描绘所选恒星族群的演化历史，并且化学丰度的典型不确定性小于0.08 dex时，整体演化历史能够可靠地保留。研究结果显示，系统树的形状受到年龄-金属丰度关系以及星系恒星形成历史的影响。低星形成率的区域产生的树比高星形成率的区域短。我们的分析表明，系统发育方法可以揭示星系演化的过程。 <div>
Phylogenetic methods have long been used in biology and more recently have been extended to other fields—for example, linguistics and technology—to study evolutionary histories. Galaxies also have an evolutionary history and fall within this broad phylogenetic framework. Under the hypothesis that chemical abundances can be used as a proxy for the interstellar medium’s DNA, phylogenetic methods allow us to reconstruct hierarchical similarities and differences among stars—essentially, a tree of evolutionary relationships and thus history. In this work, we apply phylogenetic methods to a simulated disk galaxy obtained with a chemodynamical code to test the approach. We found that at least 100 stellar particles are required to reliably portray the evolutionary history of a selected stellar population in this simulation, and that the overall evolutionary history is reliably preserved when the typical uncertainties in the chemical abundances are smaller than 0.08 dex. The results show that the shapes of the trees are strongly affected by the age–metallicity relation, as well as the star formation history of the galaxy. We found that regions with low star formation rates produce shorter trees than regions with high star formation rates. Our analysis demonstrates that phylogenetic methods can shed light on the process of galaxy evolution.

<title>Soft X-Ray Energy Spectra in the Wide-field Galactic Disk Area Revealed with HaloSat</title>

<div> HaloSat, Galactic disk, soft X-ray energy emission, unresolved high-temperature plasma, UHTPGD
<br /><br />总结:
本研究分析了HaloSat对银河盘中五个地方的观测数据，这些地方距离银心较远（135° < l < 254°），旨在理解银河盘中软X射线能量辐射的性质。通过这些观测，发现了可能存在未解的高温等离子体（UHTPGD），其温度在0.8-1.0 keV，发射度为(8-11) × 10−4 cm−6 pc。我们还观测到在没有明亮源的区域中存在UHTPGD辐射。通过堆积光谱的研究，发现星等点源可能是UHTPGD的组成部分。这项研究表明，UHTPGD可能在整个银河盘中都存在，并且可能部分起源于星等点源。 <div>
We analyzed data from HaloSat observations for five fields in the Galactic disk located far away from the Galactic center (135° < l < 254°) to understand the nature of soft X-ray energy emission in the Galactic disk. The fields have 14° diameter and were selected to contain no significant high-flux X-ray sources. All five HaloSat soft X-ray energy spectra (0.4–7 keV with energy resolution of < 100 eV below 1 keV) show a possibility of the presence of unresolved high-temperature plasma in the Galactic disk (UHTPGD) with a temperature of 0.8–1.0 keV and an emission measure of (8–11) × 10−4 cm−6 pc in addition to the soft X-ray diffuse background components mainly studied at higher Galactic latitudes (solar wind charge exchange emission, Local Hot Bubble, Milky Way halo emission, and the cosmic X-ray background). This suggests that the UHTPGD is present across the whole Galactic disk. We also observed UHTPGD emission in a region with no bright sources in an XMM-Newton field contained within one of the HaloSat fields. The temperature and emission measure are consistent with those measured with HaloSat. Moreover, the stacked spectra of the X-ray pointlike sources and near-infrared-identified point sources such as stars in the XMM-Newton field also show a spectral feature similar to the UHTPGD emission. This suggests that the UHTPGD may partly originate from pointlike sources such as stars.

<div> quasars, black hole mass function, Eddington-ratio distribution function, z = 4, broad-line AGNs
<br />
这篇文章研究了在 z=4 时红移的宽线活动星系核（AGNs）的黑洞质量函数（BHMF）和Eddington比分布函数（ERDF），并基于来自Subaru超级望远镜战略计划S16A-Wide2数据集的52个i < 23.2的类星体和来自Sloan数字Sky Survey数据第7版类星体目录中相同红移范围内的1462个i < 20.2类星体进行了研究。利用CIV 1549 Å线的宽度和1350 Å处的连续光度估算了类星体的维里黑洞（BH）质量。通过对低质量或低Eddington比范围中由流量限制选择引起的不完整性进行校正，得到了真实的宽线AGN BHMF和ERDF。与文献中 z∼2时的宽线AGN BHMF相比，我们发现大质量SMBH的数量密度在较高的红移处达到峰值，这与逐渐演化的情况一致。此外，得到的ERDF显示出负相关性，表明更大质量的SMBH倾向于以较低的Eddington比率吸积在z=4时。通过得出的真实的宽线AGN BHMF，我们还评估了 z=4 时在整个SMBH群体中宽线AGN的活动比例。得出的活跃比例可能表明与BH质量的正相关性。最后，我们通过解决连续方程来考察了 z=4 到 6 之间的宽线AGN BHMF的时间演化。结果表明 z=4–6 时的宽线AGN BHMF仅在归一化方面发生演化，但其形状没有显著变化。<br /><br />总结: 本文研究了 z=4 时的宽线活动星系核（AGNs）的黑洞质量函数（BHMF）和Eddington比分布函数（ERDF）。作者通过样本研究发现大质量SMBH的数量密度在较高的红移处达到峰值，且得到的ERDF显示出负相关性。此外，作者还评估了 z=4 时在整个SMBH群体中宽线AGN的活动比例，并考察了 z=4 到 6 之间的宽线AGN BHMF的时间演化，发现了一些有趣的结果。 <div>
We investigate the black hole mass function (BHMF) and Eddington-ratio distribution function (ERDF) of broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at z = 4, based on a sample of 52 quasars with i < 23.2 at 3.50 ≤ z ≤ 4.25 from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program S16A-Wide2 data set, and 1462 quasars with i < 20.2 in the same redshift range from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 7 quasar catalog. Virial black hole (BH) masses of quasars are estimated using the width of the CIV 1549 Å line and the continuum luminosity at 1350 Å. To obtain the intrinsic broad-line AGN BHMF and ERDF, we correct for the incompleteness in the low-mass and/or low-Eddington-ratio ranges caused by the flux-limited selection. The resulting BHMF is constrained down to . In comparison with broad-line AGN BHMFs at z ∼ 2 in the literature, we find that the number density of massive SMBHs peaks at higher redshifts, consistent with the downsizing evolutionary scenario. Additionally, the resulting ERDF shows a negative dependence on BH mass, suggesting more massive SMBHs tend to accrete at lower-Eddington ratios at z = 4. With the derived intrinsic broad-line AGN BHMF, we also evaluate the active fraction of broad-line AGNs among the entire SMBH population at z = 4. The resulting active fraction may suggest a positive dependence on BH mass. Finally, we examine the time evolution of broad-line AGN BHMF between z = 4 and 6 through solving the continuity equation. The results suggest that the broad-line AGN BHMFs at z = 4–6 only show evolution in their normalization, but with no significant changes in their shape.

Observations have shown a clear association of filament/prominence eruptions with the emergence of magnetic flux in or near filament channels. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations have been employed to systematically study the conditions under which such eruptions occur. These simulations to date have modeled filament channels as 2D flux ropes or 3D uniformly sheared arcades. Here we present MHD simulations of flux emergence into a more realistic configuration consisting of a bipolar active region containing a line-tied 3D flux rope. We use the coronal flux-rope model of Titov et al. as the initial condition and drive our simulations by imposing boundary conditions extracted from a flux emergence simulation by Leake et al. We identify three mechanisms that determine the evolution of the system: (i) reconnection displacing footpoints of field lines overlying the coronal flux rope, (ii) changes of the ambient field due to the intrusion of new flux at the boundary, and (iii) interaction of the (axial) electric currents in the preexisting and newly emerging flux systems. The relative contributions and effects of these mechanisms depend on the properties of the preexisting and emerging flux systems. Here we focus on the location and orientation of the emerging flux relative to the coronal flux rope. Varying these parameters, we investigate under which conditions an eruption of the latter is triggered.

<br />
本文通过理论研究发现了一种新的铝氮化物形成途径，并计算了相关的振动光谱常数。该发现有潜力辅助天体物理学家在星际介质中检测到新的无机物种，这可能标志着更大的尘埃颗粒的成核过程。通过对AlH3和氨转化为Al2N2H4的反应途径和振动光谱分析，为可能在实验室或观测中的研究提供了参考。AlNH6的ν8弯曲频率为755.7 cm−1（13.23 μm），具有515 km mol−1的振动跃迁强度，比二氧化碳的对称C−O伸展更强，并且具有5.40 D的偶极矩，大约是水的3倍。 <div>
A dust nucleating agent may be present in interstellar or circumstellar media that has gone seemingly undetected and unstudied for decades. Some analyses of the Murchison CM2 meteorite suggest that at least some of the aluminum present within condensed as aluminum nitrides instead of the long-studied, but heretofore undetected suite of aluminum oxides. The present theoretical study utilizes explicitly correlated coupled cluster theory and density functional theory to provide a formation pathway from alane (AlH3) and ammonia to the cyclic structure Al2N2H4, which has the proper Al/N ratio expected of bulk aluminum nitrides. Novel rovibrational spectroscopic constants are computed for alane and the first two formed structures, AlNH6 and AlNH4, along the reaction pathway for use as reference in possible laboratory or observational studies. The ν8 bending frequency for AlNH6 at 755.7 cm−1 (13.23 μm) presents a vibrational transition intensity of 515 km mol−1, more intense than the antisymmetric C−O stretch of carbon dioxide, and contains a dipole moment of 5.40 D, which is ∼3× larger than that of water. Thus, the present reaction pathway and rovibrational spectroscopic analysis may potentially assist in the astrophysical detection of novel, inorganic species which may be indicative of larger dust grain nucleation.

总结: 
Parker Solar Probe（PSP）和Solar Orbiter（SolO）任务打开了一个新的观测窗口，对内部太阳圈层进行直接测量。研究表明，行星际震荡的局部特征以及它们的环境在它们穿越太阳圈层时可能非常不同。PSP观察表明，磁场交替将在通过震荡时被压缩，而离子回旋波的特征在震荡下游消失。相比之下，SolO的观察揭示了一个非常结构化的震荡过渡，随着太阳风结构穿越震荡，出现了高达约2MeV的震荡加速质子的特征。此外，SolO还报告了由于上游震荡导致的能量较低（约100 eV）的电子散射。 <div>
The Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO) missions opened a new observational window in the inner heliosphere, which is finally accessible to direct measurements. On 2022 September 5, a coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven interplanetary (IP) shock was observed as close as 0.07 au by PSP. The CME then reached SolO, which was radially well-aligned at 0.7 au, thus providing us with the opportunity to study the shock properties at different heliocentric distances. We characterize the shock, investigate its typical parameters, and compare its small-scale features at both locations. Using the PSP observations, we investigate how magnetic switchbacks and ion cyclotron waves are processed upon shock crossing. We find that switchbacks preserve their V–B correlation while compressed upon the shock passage, and that the signature of ion cyclotron waves disappears downstream of the shock. By contrast, the SolO observations reveal a very structured shock transition, with a population of shock-accelerated protons of up to about 2 MeV, showing irregularities in the shock downstream, which we correlate with solar wind structures propagating across the shock. At SolO, we also report the presence of low-energy (∼100 eV) electrons scattering due to upstream shocklets. This study elucidates how the local features of IP shocks and their environments can be very different as they propagate through the heliosphere.

Active galactic nucleus (AGN) driven outflows can have a significant impact on the evolution of the host galaxy. In this work, we compare the properties of galaxies that host AGNs with and without outflows. Our sample consists of 103 AGNs identified by mid-IR color–color selection and confirmed with optical spectroscopy at a redshift range of 0.3 ≲ z ≲ 0.9. We fit the [O iii] λ5007 line using spectra from the zCOSMOS survey to identify and study the occurrence of outflows. We find that ionized outflows are present in ∼25% of our sample, with the largest incidence at the highest [O iii] and X-ray luminosity bins. The fastest outflows are found in the more extended and massive galaxies. We do not observe a difference in the star formation rate of AGNs with outflows compared to AGNs without outflows. From visual inspection and nonparametric morphological studies, we obtain that outflows are preferentially observed in galaxies with disk-type and elliptical morphologies.

We present JWST MIRI 5.6, 10, and 21 μm observations of the candidate failed supernova N6946-BH1 along with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFPC/IR 1.1 and 1.6 μm data and ongoing optical monitoring data with the Large Binocular Telescope. There is a very red, dusty source at the location of the candidate, which has only ∼10%–15% of the luminosity of the progenitor star. The source is very faint in the HST near-IR observations (∼103L⊙) and is not optically variable to a limit of ∼103L⊙ at the R band. The dust is likely silicate and probably has to be dominated by very large grains, as predicted for dust formed in a failed supernova. The required visual optical depths are modest, so it should begin to significantly brighten in the near-IR over the next few years.

The corona is a structure possessed by stars, including the Sun. The abnormal heating of the solar corona and chromosphere is one of the greatest mysteries in modern astronomy. While state-of-the-art observations have identified some candidates of magnetic activity events that could be responsible for this abnormal heating, and theoretical studies have proposed various heating modes, a complete physical picture of how they are heated as a whole remains elusive. In this study, the characteristics of the heated corona and chromosphere are investigated, and for the first time, the question of how they are abnormally heated is explicitly answered by analyzing the long-term observations of the global chromosphere in the Ca ii K line and the global corona in the coronal green line. The findings reveal that both the quiet chromosphere and corona are in antiphase with the solar cycle, whereas the active chromosphere and corona are in phase with it. Different parts of the solar corona and chromosphere exhibit significantly different variation characteristics and are found to be heated by different magnetic categories and probably in different modes. This study posits that unraveling the heating mystery is best approached through the lens of magnetic categories, rather than magnetic activity events.

Stellar-mass black holes (sBHs) embedded in gaseous disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be important sources of detectable gravitational radiation for LIGO/Virgo when they form binaries and coalesce due to orbital decay. In this paper, we study the effect of dynamical friction (DF) on the formation of BH binaries in AGN disks using N-body simulations. We employ two simplified models of DF, with the force on the BH depending on Δv, the velocity of the sBH relative to the background Keplerian gas. We integrate the motion of two sBHs initially on circular orbits around the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) and evaluate the probability of binary formation under various conditions. We find that both models of DF (with different dependence of the frictional coefficient on ∣Δv∣) can foster the formation of binaries when the effective friction timescale τ satisfies ΩKτ ≲ 20–30 (where ΩK is the Keplerian frequency around the SMBH): prograde binaries are formed when the DF is stronger (smaller τ), while retrograde binaries dominate when the DF is weaker (larger τ). We determine the distribution of both prograde and retrograde binaries as a function of initial orbital separation and the DF strength. Using our models of DF, we show that for a given sBH number density in the AGN disk, the formation rate of sBH binaries increases with decreasing τ and can reach a moderate value with a sufficiently strong DF.

<title>A Unified Model for Multiepoch Neutrino Events and Broadband Spectral Energy Distribution of TXS 0506+056</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The blazar TXS 0506+056 has been proposed as a high-energy neutrino emitter. However, it has been shown that the standard one-zone model cannot produce sufficiently high neutrino flux due to constraints from the X-ray data, implying more complex properties of the radiation zones in the blazar than that described by the standard one-zone model. In this work, we investigate multiepoch high-energy muon-neutrino events associated with the blazar TXS 0506+056 that occurred in 2014–2015, 2017–2018, 2021–2022, and 2022–2023, respectively. We applied the so-called “stochastic dissipation model” to account for the neutrino-blazar associations detected in the four epochs simultaneously. This model describes a scenario in which the emission of the blazar arises from the superimposition of two components: a persistent component related to the quasi-stable state of the blazar and a transient component responsible for the sudden enhancement of the blazar’s flux, either in electromagnetic radiation or in neutrino emission. The latter component could form at a random distance along the jet by a strong energy dissipation event. Under such an assumption, the multiepoch broadband spectral energy distribution can be well explained, and the expected number of high-energy neutrino events is statistically realistic. The expected number of neutrino events in half year is around 8.2, 0.07, 0.73, and 0.41, corresponding to the epoch in 2014–2015, 2017–2018, 2021–2022, and 2022–2023, respectively. Hence, our model self-consistently explains the episodic neutrino emission from TXS 0506+056.

<title>First High-resolution Spectroscopy of X-Ray Absorption Lines in the Obscured State of NGC 5548</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Multiwavelength spectroscopy of NGC 5548 revealed remarkable changes due to the presence of an obscuring wind from the accretion disk. This broadened our understanding of obscuration and outflows in active galactic nuclei. Swift monitoring of NGC 5548 shows that over the last 10 yr, the obscuration has gradually declined. This provides a valuable opportunity for analyses that have not been feasible before because of too much obscuration. The lowered obscuration, together with the high-energy spectral coverage of Chandra HETG, facilitates the first study of X-ray absorption lines in the obscured state. The comparison of the lines (Mg xi, Mg xii, Si xiii, and Si xiv) between the new and historical spectra reveals interesting changes, most notably the He-like absorption being significantly diminished in 2022. Our study finds that the changes are caused by an increase in both the ionization parameter and the column density of the warm-absorber outflow in the obscured state. This is contrary to the shielding scenario that is evident in the appearance of the UV lines, where the inner obscuring wind shields outflows that are farther out, thus lowering their ionization. The X-ray absorption lines in the HETG spectra appear to be unaffected by the obscuration. The results suggest that the shielding is complex because various components of the ionized outflow are affected differently. We explore various possibilities for the variability behavior of the X-ray absorption lines and find that the orbital motion of a clumpy ionized outflow traversing our line of sight is the most likely explanation.

<title>Constraining Annihilating Dark Matter Using the Multifrequency Radio Flux Profiles of the M33 Galaxy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Radio data can give stringent constraints for annihilating dark matter. In general, radio observations can detect very accurate radio flux density with high resolution and different frequencies for nearby galaxies. We are able to obtain the radio flux density as a function of distance from the galactic center and frequencies S(r, ν). In this article, we demonstrate a comprehensive radio analysis of the M33 galaxy, combining the radio flux density profile S(r) and the frequency spectrum S(ν) to get the constraints of dark matter annihilation parameters. By analyzing the archival radio data obtained from the Effelsberg telescope, we show that the dark matter annihilation contributing to the radio flux density might be insignificant in the disk region of the M33 galaxy. Moreover, by including the baryonic radio contribution, we constrain the 2σ conservative upper limits of the annihilation cross section, which can be complementary to the existing constraints based on neutrino, cosmic-ray, and gamma-ray observations. Our results indicate that analyzing the galactic multifrequency radio flux profiles can give useful and authentic constraints on dark matter for the leptophilic annihilation channels.

Poisson-FOCuS算法可以在计算成本的限制下优化地检测伽马射线暴，适用于即将推出的HERMES-Pathfinder卫星。该算法能够在实时并以较低的计算成本检测计数时间序列中的所有时间间隔，所有时间尺度和偏移，通过对历史数据进行验证，证明了该实施方案在自动背景评估方面具有更高的检测能力。其分析速度比历史Fermi-GBM的benchmark模拟器快两倍，实现了更高性能。总结:<br /><br />作者使用Poisson-FOCuS算法在小型卫星上实时检测伽马射线暴。他们通过验证和模拟数据表明，该算法在计算成本和检测能力方面都具有优势。 <div>
We describe how a novel online change-point detection algorithm, called Poisson-FOCuS, can be used to optimally detect gamma-ray bursts within the computational constraints imposed by miniaturized satellites such as the upcoming HERMES-Pathfinder constellation. Poisson-FOCuS enables testing for gamma-ray burst onset at all intervals in a count time series, across all timescales and offsets, in real time and at a fraction of the computational cost of conventional strategies. We validate an implementation with automatic background assessment through exponential smoothing, using archival data from Fermi-GBM. Through simulations of lightcurves modeled after real short and long gamma-ray bursts, we demonstrate that the same implementation has higher detection power than algorithms designed to emulate the logic of Fermi-GBM and Compton-BATSE, reaching the performance of a brute-force benchmark with oracle information on the true background rate, when not hindered by automatic background assessment. Finally, using simulated data with different lengths and means, we show that Poisson-FOCuS can analyze data twice as fast as a similarly implemented benchmark emulator for the historic Fermi-GBM on-board trigger algorithms.

总结:
频域分析可以帮助解决活动星系核的中心引擎尺寸问题。NGC 5548的时间延迟与经典的Shakura-Sunyaev盘模型的X射线再处理不一致，但CHAR模型能够很好地解释NGC 5548的时间延迟。此外，我们对Mrk 817进行了CHAR模型预测，并得到了有效于不同黑洞质量和Eddington比率范围内的时间延迟。我们还证明了CHAR模型的滞后 - 亮度关系与观测一致。未来的观测将有助于验证我们的结果，并为解决活动星系核的中心引擎提供新的见解。 <div>
Continuum reverberation mapping with high-cadence, long-term UV/optical monitoring of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) enables us to resolve the AGN central engine sizes on different timescales. The frequency-resolved time lags of NGC 5548 (the target for the AGN STORM I campaign) are inconsistent with the X-ray reprocessing of the classical Shakura–Sunyaev disk model. Here we show that the frequency-resolved time lags in NGC 5548 can be well produced by the Corona-Heated Accretion-disk Reprocessing (CHAR) model. Moreover, we make CHAR model predictions of the frequency-resolved time lags for Mrk 817, the source of the AGN STORM II campaign. We also obtain frequency-resolved time lags as a function of the BH mass and Eddington ratio, which is valid for BH masses from 106.5 to 109M⊙ and Eddington ratios from 0.01 to 1. Moreover, we demonstrate that with the time spans of current continuum reverberation-mapping campaigns, the lag–luminosity relation of the CHAR model can be , which is consistent with observations. Future observations can test our results and shed new light on resolving the AGN central engine.

脉冲星发出的宽带射电波在穿过星际介质时会受到扭曲和延迟。研究者使用CLEAN去卷积技术来恢复脉冲展宽的时间尺度，从而揭示脉冲的真实形状。通过模拟数据进行参数化，开发了一套测试来确定散射时间尺度及其不确定性。该算法在高度散射的毫秒脉冲星J1903+0327上进行了测试，显示散射时间尺度随时间变化，与脉冲星的折射时间尺度估计一致。这项研究还将改进的算法与循环光谱法进行了比较，验证了其有效性。 <div>
Broadband radio waves emitted from pulsars are distorted and delayed as they propagate toward the Earth due to interactions with the free electrons that compose the interstellar medium (ISM), with lower radio frequencies being more impacted than higher frequencies. Multipath propagation in the ISM results in both later times of arrival for the lower frequencies and causes the observed pulse to arrive with a broadened tail described via the pulse broadening function. We employ the CLEAN deconvolution technique to recover the pulse broadening timescale and by proxy the intrinsic pulse shape. This work expands upon previous descriptions of CLEAN deconvolution used in pulse broadening analyses by parameterizing the efficacy on simulated data and developing a suite of tests to establish which of a set of figures of merit leads to an automatic and consistent determination of the scattering timescale and its uncertainty. We compare our algorithm to the cyclic spectroscopy method of estimating the scattering timescale, specifically to the simulations performed in Dolch et al. (2021). We test our improved algorithm on the highly scattered millisecond pulsar J1903+0327, showing the scattering timescale to change over years, consistent with estimates of the refractive timescale of the pulsar.

本文详细分析了JWST NIRCam在八个滤波器下的点扩散函数（PSF），发现PSF的空间变化随波长增加而减少。且研究比较了构建模型PSF的三种常用方法，并得出PSFEx表现最佳的结论。通过模拟宽线活动星系核（AGN）的图像，评估了PSF不匹配对宿主星系属性恢复的影响。结果发现，使用不匹配的PSF模型通常会高估宿主星系的通量，同时影响宿主测量的系统误差通常大于形式拟合误差。此外，图像分解也可能导致AGN和宿主星系之间的人工偏移，这种现象在高表面亮度的宿主星系中更为常见。文章最后通过一个在CEERS领域的z = 1.646的宽线类星体示例展示了他们的PSF构建和图像分解方法。 <br /><br />总结: 本文研究了JWST NIRCam的PSF特性，评估了PSF不匹配对宿主星系属性恢复的影响，并提出了PSF构建和图像分解的方法。 <div>
We present a detailed analysis of the point-spread function (PSF) of JWST NIRCam imaging in eight filters: F070W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F444W, and F480M, using publicly available data. Spatial variations in the PSF FWHM generally decrease with wavelength: the maximum and rms fractional variations are ∼20% and 5% in F070W, reduced to ∼3% and 0.6% in F444W. We compare three commonly used methods (SWarp, photutils, and PSFEx) to construct model PSFs and conclude that PSFEx delivers the best performance. Using simulated images of broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we evaluate the impact of PSF mismatches on the recoverability of host galaxy properties. Host fluxes are generally overestimated when adopting mismatched PSF models, with larger overestimation for more AGN-dominated systems. Broader PSFs tend to produce less concentrated hosts, while narrower PSFs tend to produce more concentrated and compact hosts. Systematic uncertainties in host measurements from PSF and model mismatches are generally larger than the formal fitting uncertainties for high signal-to-noise ratio data. Image decomposition can also lead to an artificial offset between the AGN and host centroids, which is common (e.g., >1σ [3σ] detection in ∼80% [∼20%–30%] of systems), and scales with the mean host surface brightness (SB). Near the SB limit, this artificial offset can reach as large as ∼80%, 26%, and 7% of Re in systems with Re = 0.″12, 0.″48, and 1.″92, respectively. We demonstrate our PSF construction and image decomposition methods with an example broad-line quasar at z = 1.646 in the CEERS field.

总结:
这篇文章讨论了恒星自转周期、年龄的精确测量，以及磁制动的强度和与标准自转减速的偏离程度。通过利用恒星振动学，可以测量出比太阳更老的恒星的自转周期，从而可以对更大范围的老场星进行模型测试。研究发现，通过神经网络和层次化模型拟合方法的结合，可以限制磁制动减弱的开始时间。研究还表明，磁制动减弱在恒星演化到太阳阶段之前就开始了，对于类太阳恒星的主序阶段约有一半的寿命存在挑战。此外，还发现了临界罗斯比数的阈值为Rocrit/Ro⊙ = 0.91 ± 0.03。不同物理假设下的模型网格对于推断制动定律的属性有影响。这些发现对于恒星年龄的测定和自转周期的推断具有重要意义。<br /><br /> <div>
Despite a growing sample of precisely measured stellar rotation periods and ages, the strength of magnetic braking and the degree of departure from standard (Skumanich-like) spin-down have remained persistent questions, particularly for stars more evolved than the Sun. Rotation periods can be measured for stars older than the Sun by leveraging asteroseismology, enabling models to be tested against a larger sample of old field stars. Because asteroseismic measurements of rotation do not depend on starspot modulation, they avoid potential biases introduced by the need for a stellar dynamo to drive starspot production. Using a neural network trained on a grid of stellar evolution models and a hierarchical model-fitting approach, we constrain the onset of weakened magnetic braking (WMB). We find that a sample of stars with asteroseismically measured rotation periods and ages is consistent with models that depart from standard spin-down prior to reaching the evolutionary stage of the Sun. We test our approach using neural networks trained on model grids produced by separate stellar evolution codes with differing physical assumptions and find that the choices of grid physics can influence the inferred properties of the braking law. We identify the normalized critical Rossby number Rocrit/Ro⊙ = 0.91 ± 0.03 as the threshold for the departure from standard rotational evolution. This suggests that WMB poses challenges to gyrochronology for roughly half of the main-sequence lifetime of Sun-like stars.

总结: 本研究针对NGC 2264的星形成区进行了850μm的连续波偏振观测，并发现了非均匀结构的磁场。NGC 2264C地区受到重力的全局支配，而在2264D地区，磁、引力和动能之间的平衡。根据本地解析的磁场结构、重力矢量场和提取的纤维网络，推断出纤维网络主要由两组近似垂直的纤维组成。此外，重力显示出一个主导的汇聚方向，大致垂直于一个纤维方向，暗示着沿着这个方向的物质吸积。我们鉴别出两种类型的纤维，即I型纤维垂直于磁场，而II型纤维平行于磁场。我们解释这两种纤维的产生是由于受到纤维自身引力驱动的径向坍缩和受到区域全局引力驱动的纵向坍缩之间的竞争。 <div>
We report 850 μm continuum polarization observations toward the filamentary high-mass star-forming region NGC 2264, taken as part of the B-fields In STar forming Regions Observations large program on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. These data reveal a well-structured nonuniform magnetic field in the NGC 2264C and 2264D regions with a prevailing orientation around 30° from north to east. Field strength estimates and a virial analysis of the major clumps indicate that NGC 2264C is globally dominated by gravity, while in 2264D, magnetic, gravitational, and kinetic energies are roughly balanced. We present an analysis scheme that utilizes the locally resolved magnetic field structures, together with the locally measured gravitational vector field and the extracted filamentary network. From this, we infer statistical trends showing that this network consists of two main groups of filaments oriented approximately perpendicular to one another. Additionally, gravity shows one dominating converging direction that is roughly perpendicular to one of the filament orientations, which is suggestive of mass accretion along this direction. Beyond these statistical trends, we identify two types of filaments. The type I filament is perpendicular to the magnetic field with local gravity transitioning from parallel to perpendicular to the magnetic field from the outside to the filament ridge. The type II filament is parallel to the magnetic field and local gravity. We interpret these two types of filaments as originating from the competition between radial collapsing, driven by filament self-gravity, and longitudinal collapsing, driven by the region's global gravity.

The study of magnetically arrested disks (MAD) has attracted strong interest in recent years because these disk configurations were found to generate strong jets, as observed in many accreting systems. Here, we present the results of 14 general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of advection-dominated accretion flow in the MAD state across black hole (BH) spins, carried out with cuHARM. Our main findings are as follows. (i) The jets transport a significant amount of angular momentum to infinity in the form of Maxwell stresses. For positive, high spin, the rate of angular momentum transport is about five times higher than for negative spin. This contribution is nearly absent for a nonrotating BH. (ii) The mass accretion rate and the MAD parameter, both calculated at the horizon, are not correlated. However, their time derivatives are anticorrelated for every spin. (iii) For zero spin, the contribution of the toroidal component of the magnetic field to the magnetic pressure is negligible, while for a fast-spinning BH, it is on the same order as the contribution of the radial magnetic component. For high positive spin, the toroidal component even dominates. (iv) For negative spins, the jets are narrower than their positive-spin counterparts, while their fluctuations are stronger. The weak jet from the nonrotating BH is the widest with the weakest fluctuations. Our results highlight the complex nonlinear connection between the black hole spin and the resulting disk and jet properties in the MAD regime.

总结:
利用Very Large Array进行了针对IRAS 19035+0641 A的1.3 cm连续波和22.2 GHz H2O激射观测。发现了一个在尺度≲500 au的延长的双极性1.3 cm连续波结构，与上升的带内谱指数一起，强烈暗示指向IRAS 19035+0641 A的射流是电离的。此外，还确定了8个水激射点，它们与射流轴线很好地对齐。最亮的H2O激射线Stokes V谱显示可能的泽曼分裂，并且可以用拟合到Stokes I谱形的两个高斯成分的导数很好地表示。测得的Blos分别为123 (±27)和156 (±8) mG，相应的预激震磁场约为7 mG。后续的观测证实了泽曼分裂，并且发现了所有水激射点的强烈变化，其中最亮的激射完全消失。在1年的时间尺度内观察到的变化可能是一个吸积事件的结果。这些发现加强了对IRAS 19035+0641 A作为处于早期吸积/流出演化阶段的高质量原恒星的解释。 <div>
We present Very Large Array 1.3 cm continuum and 22.2 GHz H2O maser observations of the high-mass protostellar object IRAS 19035+0641 A. Our observations unveil an elongated bipolar 1.3 cm continuum structure at scales ≲500 au, which, together with a rising in-band spectral index, strongly suggests that the radio emission toward IRAS 19035+0641 A arises from an ionized jet. In addition, eight individual water maser spots well aligned with the jet axis were identified. The Stokes V spectrum of the brightest H2O maser line (∼100 Jy) shows a possible Zeeman splitting and is well represented by the derivatives of two Gaussian components fitted to the Stokes I profile. The measured Blos are 123 (±27) and 156 (±8) mG, translating to a preshock magnetic field of ≈7 mG. Subsequent observations to confirm the Zeeman splitting showed intense variability in all the water maser spots, with the brightest maser completely disappearing. The observed variability in a 1 yr timescale could be the result of an accretion event. These findings strengthen our interpretation of IRAS 19035+0641 A as a high-mass protostar in an early accretion/outflow evolutionary phase.

<div> photodissociated gas, Trifid Nebula, kinematics, PDRs, H ii region
<br /><br />总结:
本文分析了年轻的三叉戟星云的运动学特征，基于远红外[C ii] 158μm和[O i] 63μm的速度分辨观测。PDR的分布呈现出质量为516 M⊙的红移和蓝移PDR壳层，动能约为1047 erg。观测到的PDR壳层的动量低于理论计算预测的，这提示M20星云由于周围气体被传播的电离前沿所吹散而发生了显著的质量丢失。总体来说，文章揭示了H ii区的热能以及HD 169442A的恒星风流明度对M20星云的动力学演化造成的影响。 <div>
Photodissociated gas bears the signature of the dynamical evolution of the ambient interstellar medium impacted by the mechanical and radiative feedback from an expanding H ii region. Here we present an analysis of the kinematics of the young Trifid Nebula, based on velocity-resolved observations of the far-infrared fine structure lines of [C ii] at 158 μm and [O i] at 63 μm. The distribution of the photodissociated regions (PDRs) surrounding the nebula is consistent with a shell-like structure created by the H ii region expanding at a velocity of 5 km s−1. Comparison of ratios of [C ii] and [O i]63 μm intensities for identical velocity components with PDR models indicate a density of 104 cm−3. The redshifted and blueshifted PDR shells with a combined mass of 516 M⊙ have a kinetic energy of ∼1047 erg. This is consistent with the thermal energy of the H ii region as well as with the energy deposited by the stellar wind luminosity from HD 169442A, an O7 V star, over the 0.5 Myr lifetime of the star. The observed momentum of the PDR shell is lower than what theoretical calculations predict for the radial momentum due to the shell being swept up by an expanding H ii region, which suggests that significant mass loss has occurred in M20 due to the dispersal of the surrounding gas by the advancing ionization front.

<div> N v, X-ray emission lines, electron-impact collisions, astrophysical emission models, many-body perturbation theory method
总结:
本研究对N v X射线发射线进行了实验测量，发现其强度约为共振线的五分之一。此外，还提供了融合线的波长数据，并进行了原子结构计算的测试，结果与理论计算方法的计算结果相吻合。这些实验和理论数据为精确的静止波长提供了基准，可帮助确定活跃星系核和其他天体物质吸收特征的速度。 <div>
We present laboratory measurements of n = 3 → n = 1 N v X-ray emission lines situated near 26 Å. The lines are excited by electron-impact collisions and are shown to reach a combined intensity of about a fifth of the combined strong N v 1s2s2p2P1/2,3/2 → 1s22s2S1/2 resonance lines, commonly labeled q and r, at 29.4 Å. In addition, we present new experimental data for the wavelength of the blended q and r lines at 29.4 Å, as well as for that of the blended inner-shell-excited N v lines u and v at 30.0 Å. All of these collisional N v lines need to be included in astrophysical emission models in order to properly account for flux from N v in the soft X-ray region. The measured wavelengths provide benchmarks for testing atomic structure calculations and excellent agreement is found with our calculations using the many-body perturbation theory method. We provide a complete listing of the N v energy levels with valence electrons in the n = 2, 3, and 4 shells calculated with this approach. The experimental and theoretical data, thus, provide accurate rest-frame wavelengths needed for velocity determinations based on high-resolution absorption features in spectra of warm absorbers in active galactic nuclei and other astrophysical objects.

<div> 关键词: dark galaxies, IllustrisTNG, 暗物质晕, 星等

总结: 本研究利用IllustrisTNG宇宙水动力学模拟研究了暗物质星系的形成和演化。首先识别了具有恒星质量-总质量比M*/Mtot小于10−4的暗物质星系，与具有M*/Mtot ≥ 10−4的发光星系不同。然后选择了具有大约10^9h-1M⊙暗物质暗物质晕质量的星系，比较它们的物理特性与发光星系。发现，在当今宇宙（z = 0）中，暗物质星系主要位于无星形气体的空洞区域。此外，暗物质星系倾向于具有比较大的尺寸和更高的自旋参数。在早期宇宙中，暗物质星系和发光星系在自旋和局部环境估计的分布上存在较小差异，随着演化，这两个样本之间的差异变得更加显著。研究结果表明，与发光星系不同，暗物质星系倾向于最初形成在密度较小的区域，并且由于宇宙复电离的加热以及与其他含有恒星的系统的相互作用和并合较少而无法形成恒星。这项基于数值模拟的研究能够为验证观测中的暗物质星系候选者和约束星系形成模型提供重要线索。 <div>
We study the formation and evolution of dark galaxies using the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. We first identify dark galaxies with stellar-to-total mass ratios, M*/Mtot, smaller than 10−4, which differ from luminous galaxies with M*/Mtot ≥ 10−4. We then select the galaxies with a dark matter halo mass of ∼109h−1M⊙ for mass completeness and compare their physical properties with those of luminous galaxies. We find that, at the present epoch (z = 0), dark galaxies are predominantly located in void regions without star-forming gas. We also find that dark galaxies tend to have larger sizes and higher spin parameters than luminous galaxies. In the early universe, dark and luminous galaxies show small differences in the distributions of spin and local environment estimates, and the difference between the two samples becomes more significant as they evolve. Our results suggest that, unlike luminous galaxies, dark galaxies tend to be initially formed in less dense regions and could not form stars because of heating from cosmic reionization and few interactions and mergers with other systems containing stars. This study based on numerical simulations can provide important hints for validating dark galaxy candidates in observations and for constraining galaxy formation models.

总结:<br /><br />研究比较了在A2744星系团中使用ALMA 1.2毫米数据和SCUBA-2 450和850 μm成像的效果。结果显示，将SCUBA-2数据与JWST红外观测相结合可以更有效地发现微弱尘埃星系的存在。通过比对观测结果，研究确认约95%的微弱尘埃星系，并且借助红外先验条件还可以进一步深入ALMA图像观测。同时，发现46/69的ALMA源在850 μm波段有信号，24/69在450 μm波段也有信号，总检测率接近75%。另外，发现SCUBA-2检测到的比例在z=3后略有下降，推测这可能与ALMA选择以及波段之间的信号比有关。这项研究强调了结合SCUBA-2数据和JWST颜色观测可以更好地绘制微弱尘埃星系的能力。 <div>
We make a comparison of deep SCUBA-2 450 and 850 μm imaging on the massive lensing cluster field A2744 with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.2 mm data. Our primary goal is to assess how effective the wider-field SCUBA-2 sample, in combination with red JWST priors, is for finding faint dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) compared to the much more expensive mosaicked ALMA observations. We cross-match our previously reported direct (>5σ) SCUBA-2 sample and red JWST NIRCam prior-selected (>3σ) SCUBA-2 sample to direct ALMA sources from the DUALZ survey. We find that roughly 95% are confirmed by ALMA. The red priors also allow us to probe deeper in the ALMA image. Next, by measuring the 450 and 850 μm properties of the full ALMA sample, we show that 46/69 of the ALMA sources are detected at 850 μm and 24/69 are detected at 450 μm in the SCUBA-2 images, with a total detection fraction of nearly 75%. All of the robust (>5σ) ALMA sources that are not detected in at least one SCUBA-2 band lie at 1.2 mm fluxes ≲0.6 mJy and are undetected primarily due to the higher SCUBA-2 flux limits. We also find that the SCUBA-2 detection fraction drops slightly beyond z = 3, which we attribute to the increasing 1.2 mm to 850 μm and 1.2 mm to 450 μm flux ratios combined with the ALMA selection. The results emphasize the power of combining SCUBA-2 data with JWST colors to map the faint DSFG population.

<div> 关键词: Mars, MAVEN, solar wind, deceleration, pickup ions
总结:<br /><br />这项研究使用Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN)获取的粒子和磁场测量数据，研究了火星弓形震波上游的太阳风减速情况。研究发现，平均太阳风减速约为初始太阳风速度的0.7%，远小于先前研究得出的数值。进一步的计算表明，这种观察到的减速与捕获离子质量装载场景是一致的。这一发现对太阳风与火星上层大气的相互作用有重要意义。 <div>
The solar wind deceleration upstream of the Martian bow shock is examined using particle and magnetic field measurements obtained by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN). Mars lacks a strong intrinsic magnetic field so its upper atmosphere extends beyond the Martian bow shock and interacts directly with the solar wind. Neutral atoms in the Martian upper atmosphere can be ionized through several physical processes and then start to move with the solar wind flow to form pickup ions. In return, the solar wind is expected to slow down due to the momentum transfer to the pickup ions. The present study surveys the MAVEN solar wind measurements between 2015 and 2019 to evaluate the solar wind deceleration upstream of the Martian bow shock. Different from previous studies of solar wind deceleration, our analysis carefully excludes the solar wind deceleration in the shock foot region. The average solar wind deceleration obtained is about 0.7% of the initial solar wind speed, much smaller than the values given by previous studies. Further calculation using several reasonable Martian upper atmosphere density profiles demonstrates that the deceleration observed is consistent with the pickup ion mass-loading scenario.

<title>The Missing Symbiotic Stars: A Joint Analysis with Gaia, GALEX, and XMM-Newton Data</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The existence of a population of low-accretion-rate symbiotic stars (SySts), consisting of a giant star and a compact companion (usually a white dwarf), has been proposed recently. However, their population has not been fully understood. In this work, we present an investigation on SySts candidates consisting of asymptotic giant branch stars (AGBs) by cross-correlating the Gaia DR3, the Galaxy Evolution Explorer All-Sky Imaging Survey, and the 4XMM DR13 catalogs. We first build a sample of AGBs within 500 pc based on their locations in the Gaia color–absolute magnitude diagram. We then explore the UV and X-ray properties of the sampled AGBs and compare them to known SySts and candidates. We find 10 SySts candidates based on the far-ultraviolet excess. The typical UV luminosity of the candidates is 1031 erg s−1, which corresponds to a typical accretion rate of 10−12–10−11M⊙ yr−1, which is more than 1 order of magnitude lower than known SySts. Based on these findings, the total number of SySts within 500 pc is estimated to be 18. The number of AGBs with X-ray flux above 10−14 erg s−1 cm−2 within 500 pc is estimated to be 37. Our finding implies that a large number of low-accretion-rate SySts are yet to be detected, which provides a base for a complete understanding of their population.

<title>Analysis of the 3.2–3.3 μm Interstellar Absorption Feature on Three Milky Way Sightlines</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report new analyses of spectra of the 3.2–3.3 μm absorption feature observed in the diffuse interstellar medium toward three Milky Way sources: 2MASS J17470898 − 2829561 (2M1747) and the Quintuplet Cluster, both located in the Galactic center, and Cygnus OB2-12. The 3.2–3.3 μm interval coincides with the CH-stretching region for compact polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We focus on the 2M1747 spectrum. Its published optical depth spectrum contains residual telluric transmission features, which arise from the 0.06 difference in mean airmasses between the observations of the source and its telluric standard star. We corrected the published spectrum by adding the airmass residual optical depth spectrum. The corrected spectrum is well fit by a superposition of four Gaussians. The absorption spectra of the other two sources were also fit by four Gaussians, with similar central wavelengths, widths, and relative peak opacities. We associate the three longer wavelength Gaussians covering the 3.23–3.31 μm interval with compact PAHs in positive, neutral, and negative charge states. We identify the shortest-wavelength Gaussian, near 3.21 μm, with irregularly shaped PAHs. Constraints imposed by spectral smoothness on the corrected 2M1747 spectrum, augmented by a PAH cluster formation model for post-asymptotic giant branch stars, suggests that >99% of the PAHs in the diffuse interstellar medium reside in small clusters. This study supports the PAH hypothesis, and it suggests that a family of primarily compact PAHs with a C66H20 (circumvalene) parent is consistent with the observed mid-infrared and ultraviolet interstellar absorption spectrum.

总结:
本研究训练了一组基于1D辐射传输代码TARDIS的深度神经网络，用于模拟超新星爆炸后10至40天内的Ia型超新星（SNe Ia）的光学光谱。这些神经网络被应用于推导一组124个观测良好的SNe Ia样本中的速度范围在光球以上的56Ni质量。一部分SNe具有多时相观测数据，可以用56Ni的衰变来定量测试AIAI。采用观测光谱数据进行的AIAI推导的56Ni质量与56Ni的放射性衰变速率相吻合。AIAI揭示了与Ni ii 4067Å线相关的3890Å附近的光谱特征，而从AIAI中推导的56Ni质量与SNe Ia的光变曲线形状相关联，光度曲线较宽的SNe Ia在光球以上的外壳中显示出更大的56Ni质量。AIAI使得SNe的光谱数据可以在基于明确定义的物理假设的理论框架下进行定量分析。 <div>
Following our previous study of Artificial Intelligence Assisted Inversion (AIAI) of supernova analyses, we train a set of deep neural networks based on the 1D radiative transfer code TARDIS to simulate the optical spectra of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) between 10 and 40 days after the explosion. The neural networks are applied to derive the mass of 56Ni in velocity ranges above the photosphere for a sample of 124 well-observed SNe Ia in the TARDIS model context. A subset of the SNe have multi-epoch observations for which the decay of the radioactive 56Ni can be used to test the AIAI quantitatively. The 56Ni mass derived from AIAI using the observed spectra as inputs for this subset agrees with the radioactive decay rate of 56Ni. AIAI reveals that a spectral signature near 3890 Å is related to the Ni ii 4067Å line, and the 56Ni mass deduced from AIAI is found to be correlated with the light-curve shapes of SNe Ia, with SNe Ia with broader light curves showing larger 56Ni mass in the envelope above the photosphere. AIAI enables spectral data of SNe to be quantitatively analyzed under theoretical frameworks based on well-defined physical assumptions.

<br />这篇文章报告了在GOODS-S场中使用JWST/NIRCam成像和FRESCO进行的广角狭缝光谱仪成像发现了一个在z = 5.4处的极端星系过密度。通过使用λ = 0.4–5.0 μm的哈勃空间望远镜+JWST光度测定确定了过密度潜在成员。随后通过JWST狭缝光谱仪在λ = 3.9–5.0 μm范围内对Hα进行了目标线搜索，确认了5.2 < z < 5.5处81个星系，其中42个在场内，39个在密度约为随机体积的10倍的区域内。从光度测定中推断这些星系的恒星群，并构建了星系的主序，发现原星团成员相对于场内星系拥有更大的质量和更早的星形成。根据经验恒星质量到暗物质晕的关系，估计了这一大尺度结构的总暗物质质量，但由于不完整性，这可能是一个低估。我们的发现展示了JWST在非常早期的宇宙时期约束暗物质晕组装和星系形成的能力。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究使用JWST探测到了z = 5.4处的星系过密度，通过光度测定和狭缝光谱仪确认了81个星系，并研究了它们的恒星群，发现了这一大尺度结构的重要特征，展示了JWST在非常早期宇宙时期的强大能力。 <div>
We report the discovery of an extreme galaxy overdensity at z = 5.4 in the GOODS-S field using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRCam imaging from JADES and JEMS alongside JWST/NIRCam wide-field slitless spectroscopy from FRESCO. We identified potential members of the overdensity using Hubble Space Telescope+JWST photometry spanning λ = 0.4–5.0 μm. These data provide accurate and well-constrained photometric redshifts down to m ≈ 29–30 mag. We subsequently confirmed N = 81 galaxies at 5.2 < z < 5.5 using JWST slitless spectroscopy over λ = 3.9–5.0 μm through a targeted line search for Hα around the best-fit photometric redshift. We verified that N = 42 of these galaxies reside in the field, while N = 39 galaxies reside in a density around ∼10 times that of a random volume. Stellar populations for these galaxies were inferred from the photometry and used to construct the star-forming main sequence, where protocluster members appeared more massive and exhibited earlier star formation (and thus older stellar populations) when compared to their field galaxy counterparts. We estimate the total halo mass of this large-scale structure to be using an empirical stellar mass to halo mass relation, which is likely an underestimate as a result of incompleteness. Our discovery demonstrates the power of JWST at constraining dark matter halo assembly and galaxy formation at very early cosmic times.

这篇文章报道了使用TESS光度测量发现了九颗新的超新星变星，它们具有负超黄短周期信号。其中三颗星在矮新星爆发期间仍具有负超黄信号，并且该信号的振幅会随着爆发的变化而变化。另外六颗星的研究较少，这是首次确定它们的轨道周期、负超黄信号和超轨道信号周期。研究还发现其中两颗星的负超黄周期和振幅会随着超轨道信号周期的变化而变化。文章指出，负超黄振幅随着爆发的变化可以成为研究负超黄来源和改进盘不稳定模型的重要依据。同时，文章也认为单一倾斜盘角度的变化不能完全解释超轨道信号的观测结果，需要考虑其他因素。 <div>
Negative superhumps (NSHs) are signals a few percent shorter than the orbital period of a binary star and are considered to originate from the reverse precession of the tilted disk. Based on TESS photometry, we find nine new cataclysmic variable stars with NSHs. Three (ASAS J1420, TZ Per, and V392 Hya) of these stars similar to AH Her still have NSHs during dwarf nova outbursts, and the NSH amplitude varies with the outburst. The variation in the radius of the accretion disk partially explains this phenomenon. However, it does not explain the rebound of the NSH amplitude after the peak of the outburst and the fact that the NSH amplitude of the quiescence is sometimes not the largest, and it is necessary to include the disk instability model (DIM) and add other ingredients. Therefore, we suggest that the variation of NSH amplitude with outburst can be an important basis for studying the origin of NSHs and improving the DIM. The six (ASASSN-V J1137, ASASSN-V J0611, 2MASS J0715, LAMOST J0925, ASASSN-17qj, and ZTF 18acakuxo) remaining stars have been poorly studied, and for the first time we determine their orbital periods, NSHs, and superorbital signal (SOR) periods. The NSH periods and amplitudes of ASASSN-V J1137 and ASASSN-17qj vary with the SOR, and based on the comparison of the observations with the theory, we suggest that a single change in tilted disk angle does not explain the observations of the SOR and that other ingredients need to be considered as well.

<br /><br />总结: Changing-look AGNs是一类特殊的活动星系核，其物理特性介于FSRQs和BL Lacs之间。通过高斯混合模型分析，研究发现CLBs可能是由于吸积过程改变而产生的过渡类型，对理解CLBs的物理特性具有重要意义。 <div>
Changing-look active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are a special class of AGNs that change their spectral type from type 1 to type 2 or vice versa. In recent years, a number of changing-look blazars (CLBs) were also reported, which transition between flat-spectrum radio quasars and BL Lacs. The physical properties of CLBs are still unclear. Using the mclust R package for Gaussian mixture modeling, we performed a clustering analysis for a sample of 105 CLBs selected from the literature. Three kinds of analysis found that CLBs lie in between the parameter distributions of FSRQs and BL Lacs: (i) univariate analysis; (ii) bivariate analysis; and (iii) multivariate analysis, carried out with a dimension reduction approach of the physical properties of the three types of blazars. Our results suggest that CLBs belong to a transition type between FSRQs and BL Lacs, which may be regulated by the change of accretion process and may be similar to other changing-look AGNs.

超大质量黑洞能够通过旋转超辐射放大入射的玻色子波，诱导超轻量玻色子围绕它们形成束缚态。这种现象有潜力限制新玻色子的参数空间。轴子和轴子样粒子（ALP）是候选的超标准模型粒子，它们可以在超大质量黑洞（SMBH）周围形成这样的尘埃云，并通过轴子-光子耦合对偏振信号产生类似法拉第旋转的影响。之前的努力利用事件视界望远镜（EHT）M87 2017年观测的偏振图像来限制无量纲轴子-光子耦合到以前未曾探索的区域。然而，借助新的校准不敏感量、闭合迹和共轭闭合迹积，可以约束轴子云的存在，同时避免系统误差的主要来源，例如站点增益和极化泄漏。我们利用M87*的偏振图的简单几何模型，通过模拟和实际数据集拟合模型参数，并在M87中达到了可比较的排除轴子云的精度水平。我们的方法的未来应用包括事件视界望远镜和下一代事件视界望远镜对M87*和Sgr A*的观测，预计将在更广泛的轴子和ALP质量范围内产生更强的约束。由于它不需要成像，闭合迹分析可以应用于成像边缘的目标活动星系核，大大扩展了可以从中得到轴子限制的超大质量黑洞的数量。 <br /><br />总结:黑洞可以通过超旋转辐射放大入射的玻色子波，诱导围绕它们形成束缚态。轴子和轴子样粒子可以形成尘埃云并影响偏振信号。利用闭合迹分析可以约束轴子云的存在，避免系统误差。未来的观测预计会产生更强的约束，扩展了限制轴子的超大质量黑洞的范围。 <div>
Black holes can amplify incoming bosonic waves via rotational superradiance, inducing bound states of ultralight bosons around them. This phenomenon has the potential to confine the parameter spaces of new bosons. Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) are candidate beyond-standard-model particles that can form such clouds around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and impact the polarization signal in a similar fashion to Faraday rotation via axion–photon coupling. Prior efforts have used polarized images from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) M87 2017 observations to limit the dimensionless axion–photon coupling to previously unexplored regions. However, with the novel calibration-insensitive quantities, closure traces, and conjugate closure trace products, it is possible to constrain the existence of axion clouds while avoiding the dominant sources of systematic uncertainties, e.g., station gains and polarization leakages. We utilize a simple geometric model for the polarization map of M87* to fit the model parameters with both simulated and real data sets and reach a comparable level of constraint in the accuracy with which an axion cloud may be excluded in M87. Future applications of our approach include subsequent M87* and Sgr A* observations by EHT and the next-generation EHT that are expected to produce stronger constraints across a wider range of axion and ALP masses. Because it does not require imaging, closure trace analyses may be applied to target active galactic nuclei for which imaging is marginal, extending the number of SMBHs from which axion limits may be obtained significantly.

本研究通过比较年轻、大质量恒星的动力学与银河澳大利亚广域阵列路径探测器调查的中性原子氢高分辨率观测来建立了小麦哲伦云的新模型。研究发现小麦哲伦云由两种结构组成，具有不同的恒星和气体化学成分。模型成功地再现了观测结果，并显示小麦哲伦云的星际介质被排列成两个叠加的、具有相似气体质量的、沿视线分隔约5千秒差距的星际系统。 <div>
The structure and dynamics of the star-forming disk of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) have long confounded us. The SMC is widely used as a prototype for galactic physics at low metallicity, and yet we fundamentally lack an understanding of the structure of its interstellar medium (ISM). In this work, we present a new model for the SMC by comparing the kinematics of young, massive stars with the structure of the ISM traced by high-resolution observations of neutral atomic hydrogen (H i) from the Galactic Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder survey. Specifically, we identify thousands of young, massive stars with precise radial velocity constraints from the Gaia and APOGEE surveys and match these stars to the ISM structures in which they likely formed. By comparing the average dust extinction toward these stars, we find evidence that the SMC is composed of two structures with distinct stellar and gaseous chemical compositions. We construct a simple model that successfully reproduces the observations and shows that the ISM of the SMC is arranged into two superimposed, star-forming systems with similar gas mass separated by ∼5 kpc along the line of sight.

总结:
本研究使用NOEMA对两个红移约为6的类星体进行了观测，发现它们的CO谱线能量分布（SLED）分别显示出最高和最低的激发水平。对P215−16进行的辐射传输建模表明，由活动星系核加热的分子气体可能是高CO激发的合理来源。而对J1429+5447的CO SLED分析显示，来自单个光解区的成分可以解释这个射电明亮类星体中的CO激发。这项工作突显了CO SLED在揭示红移最高的年轻类星体-星爆系统中的星际介质属性方面的实用性。CO SLED的多样性揭示了这些早期演化阶段的气体条件和激发机制的复杂性。 <div>
We present observations using the Northern Extended Millimetre Array (NOEMA) of CO and H2O emission lines and the underlying dust continuum in two quasars at z ∼ 6, i.e., P215−16 at z = 5.78 and J1429+5447 at z = 6.18. Notably, among all published CO spectral line energy distributions (SLEDs) of quasars at z ∼ 6, the two systems reveal the highest and the lowest CO levels of excitation, respectively. Our radiative transfer modeling of the CO SLED of P215−16 suggests that the molecular gas heated by active galactic nuclei could be a plausible origin for the high CO excitation. For J1429+5447, we obtain the first well-sampled CO SLED (from transitions from 2−1 to 10−9) of a radio-loud quasar at z ≳ 6. Analysis of the CO SLED suggests that a component from a single photodissociation region could explain the CO excitation in the radio-loud quasar J1429+5447. This work highlights the utility of the CO SLED in uncovering the properties of the interstellar medium in these young quasar–starburst systems at the highest redshift. The diversity of the CO SLEDs reveals the complexities in gas conditions and excitation mechanisms at their early evolutionary stage.

该研究利用现代空间任务探测到的太阳式振荡，对成千上万颗恒星的质量和年龄进行测量，并应用于银河考古学研究。研究表明，尺度关系并非只与有效温度和表面重力成正比，而是受金属丰度影响。通过进行三维近表面对流模拟，研究发现振荡频率与金属丰度呈负相关，与之前使用一维模型得出的正相关结果矛盾。此外，研究对振动速度进行理论估计，结果表明在太阳的有效温度和表面重力下，并不呈现出与金属丰度的相关性。这一研究提出了一个令人兴奋的前景，即通过真实的三维流体动力学恒星模型来测试天体测震尺度关系。 <br /> <div>
Solar-like oscillations have been detected in thousands of stars thanks to modern space missions. These oscillations have been used to measure stellar masses and ages, which have been widely applied in Galactic archeology. One of the pillars of such applications is the scaling relation: the frequency of maximum power , assumed to be proportional to the acoustic cutoff frequency, νac, scales with effective temperature and surface gravity. However, the theoretical basis of the scaling relation is uncertain, and there is an ongoing debate about whether it can be applied to metal-poor stars. We investigate the metallicity dependence of the scaling relation by carrying out 3D near-surface convection simulations for solar-type stars with [Fe/H] between −3 and 0.5 dex. First, we found a negative correlation between νac and metallicity from the 3D models. This is in tension with the positive correlation identified by studies using 1D models. Second, we estimated theoretical values using velocity amplitudes determined from first principles, by quantifying the mode excitation and damping rates with methods validated in our previous works. We found that does not show correlation with metallicity at solar effective temperature and surface gravity. This study opens an exciting prospect of testing the asteroseismic scaling relations against realistic 3D hydrodynamical stellar models.

<div> 关键词: SN-associated GRB, multiwavelength properties, afterglow, central engine, top-hat jet model

总结:
本研究深入探讨了附近超新星（SN）相关的低亮度伽马射线暴（GRB）171205A的多波段特性，以综合限制其物理起源。我们发现脉冲宽度与能量呈幂律关系，这与其他SN/GRBs的指数一致，但大于长GRBs的指数。分析预警伽马射线和X射线平台的总体光变曲线后，推断早期X射线和伽马射线应反映了中心发动机的活动，而晚期X射线可能受外部冲击与周围物质的相互作用的影响。此外，我们发现GRB 171205A的宿主无线电流量和偏移与其他附近低亮度GRB的情况相似。采用九个带有测定偏移的SN/GRB建立了峰值光度（Lγ,p）与谱滞后（τ）之间的关系，得到Lγ,p ∝ τ−1.91±0.33。发现12个SN/GRB和10个长寿命超新星相关的GRB的峰值光度和投影物理偏移之间有适度的相关性，暗示它们具有不同的祖先。通过顶帽形射流模型拟合的多波段余辉表明，GRB 171205A的射流半展开角和视角分别约为34.°4和41.°8，暗示正面以外的发射受到外周囊层的主导，而不是射流核心。 <div>
Multiwavelength properties of the nearby supernova (SN)-associated low-luminosity GRB 171205A are investigated in depth to constrain its physical origin synthetically. The pulse width is found to be correlated with energy with a power-law index of −0.24 ± 0.07, which is consistent with the indices of other SN-associated gamma-ray bursts (SN/GRBs) but larger than those of long GRBs. By analyzing the overall light curve of its prompt gamma rays and X-ray plateaus simultaneously, we infer that the early X-rays together with the gamma-rays should reflect the activities of the central engine, while the late X-rays may be dominated by the interaction of external shocks with circumburst material. In addition, we find that the host radio flux and offset of GRB 171205A are similar to those of other nearby low-luminosity GRBs. We adopt nine SN/GRBs with measured offset to build a relation between peak luminosity (Lγ,p) and spectral lag (τ) as Lγ,p ∝ τ−1.91±0.33. The peak luminosity and the projected physical offset of 12 SN/GRBs and 10 kilonova-associated GRBs are found to be moderately correlated, suggesting their different progenitors. The multiwavelength afterglow fitted with a top-hat jet model indicates that the jet half-opening angle and the viewing angle of GRB 171205A are ∼34.°4 and 41.°8, respectively, which implies that the off-axis emissions are dominated by the peripheral cocoon rather than the jet core.

Black hole (BH) X-ray binaries (XRBs) are ideal targets to study the connection between accretion inflow and jet outflow. Here we present quasi-simultaneous, multiwavelength observations of the Galactic BH system MAXI J1820+070, throughout its 2018–2019 outburst. Our data set includes coverage from the radio through X-ray bands from 17 different instruments/telescopes, and encompasses 19 epochs over a 7 month period, resulting in one of the most well-sampled multiwavelength data sets of a BH XRB outburst to date. With our data, we compile and model the broadband spectra of this source using a phenomenological model that includes emission from the jet, a companion star, and an accretion flow. This modeling allows us to track the evolution of the spectral break in the jet spectrum, a key observable that samples the jet launching region. We find that the spectral break location changes over at least ≈3 orders of magnitude in electromagnetic frequency over this period. Using these spectral break measurements, we link the full cycle of jet behavior, including the rising, quenching, and reignition, to the changing accretion flow properties as the source evolves through its different accretion states. Our analysis shows consistent jet behavior with other sources in similar phases of their outbursts, reinforcing the idea that jet quenching and recovery may be a global feature of BH XRB systems in outburst. Our results also provide valuable evidence supporting a close connection between the geometry of the inner accretion flow and the base of the jet.

<title>Jet Structure and Burst Environment of GRB 221009A</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We conducted a comprehensive investigation of the brightest-of-all-time GRB 221009A, using new insights from very high-energy (VHE) observations from LHAASO and a complete multiwavelength afterglow data set. Through data fitting, we imposed constraints on the jet structure, radiation mechanisms, and burst environment of GRB 221009A. Our findings reveal a structured jet morphology characterized by a core+wing configuration. A smooth transition of energy within the jet takes place between the core and wing, but with a discontinuity in the bulk Lorentz factor. The jet structure differs from both the case of the short GRB 170817A and the results of numerical simulations for long-duration bursts. The VHE emission can be explained by the forward shock synchrotron self-Compton radiation of the core component, but requiring a distinctive transition of the burst environment from uniform to wind-like, suggesting the presence of complex pre-burst mass ejection processes. The low-energy multiwavelength afterglow is mainly governed by the synchrotron radiation from the forward and reverse shocks of the wing component. Our analysis indicates a magnetization factor of 5 for the wing component. Additionally, by comparing the forward shock parameters of the core and wing components, we find a potential correlation between the electron acceleration efficiency and both the Lorentz factor of the shock and the magnetic field equipartition factor. We discuss the significance of our findings, potential interpretations, and remaining issues.

<div> SN 2022oqm, Type Ic supernova, early-time spectral observations, CSM, shock cooling

总结:<br />
SN 2022oqm是一次Ic型超新星，早期光谱观测显示出高离子化的碳和氧吸收特征，指示着存在扩展的C/O物质。光谱和光曲线的演变表明，这次超新星最初的行为可以通过与光学薄的CSM的相互作用以及激冷来解释。在t = 60天时，SN 2022oqm的光谱显示出强烈的Ca ii和[Ca ii]发射，没有检测到[O i]，标志着这个事件是富含Ca的。因此，观测结果支持了三种潜在的解释：一个质量庞大的致密前体、一个带有延伸包层的质量剥离前体，或者一个含有白矮星的双星系统。 <div>
We present the discovery and analysis of SN 2022oqm, a Type Ic supernova (SN) detected <1 day after the explosion. The SN rises to a blue and short-lived (2 days) initial peak. Early-time spectral observations of SN 2022oqm show a hot (40,000 K) continuum with high ionization C and O absorption features at velocities of 4000 km s−1, while its photospheric radius expands at 20,000 km s−1, indicating a pre-existing distribution of expanding C/O material. After ∼2.5 days, both the spectrum and light curves evolve into those of a typical SN Ic, with line velocities of ∼10,000 km s−1, in agreement with the evolution of the photospheric radius. The optical light curves reach a second peak at t ≈ 15 days. By t = 60 days, the spectrum of SN 2022oqm becomes nearly nebular, displaying strong Ca ii and [Ca ii] emission with no detectable [O i], marking this event as Ca-rich. The early behavior can be explained by 10−3M⊙ of optically thin circumstellar material (CSM) surrounding either (1) a massive compact progenitor such as a Wolf–Rayet star, (2) a massive stripped progenitor with an extended envelope, or (3) a binary system with a white dwarf. We propose that the early-time light curve is powered by both the interaction of the ejecta with the optically thin CSM and shock cooling (in the massive star scenario). The observations can be explained by CSM that is optically thick to X-ray photons, is optically thick in the lines as seen in the spectra, and is optically thin to visible-light continuum photons that come either from downscattered X-rays or from the shock-heated ejecta. Calculations show that this scenario is self-consistent.

这篇文章研究了SPRC047周围的星体群，使用星体的光谱能量分布来分析星体群的性质，尝试通过分段来获取最佳拟合结果。作者使用了多种星体形成历史先验来进行拟合，并指出由于波长覆盖不足和光信噪比低，无法解决年龄-金属丰度-尘埃的退化问题。作者还讨论了未来深度的可见-近红外观测结合绝对光通量校准的重要性，以及中等紫外线和中红外波段的观测将如何提高宽带SED拟合结果的准确性，从而改进类似未解析成星体的邻近星系周围的低表面亮度目标的研究。 <div>
We have investigated the properties (e.g., age, metallicity) of the stellar populations of a ringlike tidal stellar stream (or streams) around the edge-on galaxy SPRC047 (z = 0.031) using spectral energy distribution (SED) fits to integrated broadband aperture flux densities. We used visual images in six different bands and Spitzer/IRAC 3.6 μm data. We have attempted to derive best-fit stellar population parameters (metallicity, age) in three noncontiguous segments of the stream. Due to the very low surface brightness of the stream, we have performed a deconvolution with a Richardson–Lucy–type algorithm of the low spatial resolution 3.6 μm IRAC image, thereby reducing the effect of the point-spread function aliased emission from the bright edge-on central galaxy at the locations of our three stream segments. Our SED fits that used several different star formation (SF) history priors, from an exponentially decaying SF burst to continuous SF, indicate that the age–metallicity–dust degeneracy is not resolved, most likely because of inadequate wavelength coverage and low signal-to-noise ratios of the low surface brightness features. We also discuss how future deep visual–near-infrared observations, combined with absolute flux calibration uncertainties at or below the 1% level, complemented by equally well absolute flux-calibrated observations in ultraviolet and mid-infrared bands, would improve the accuracy of broadband SED fitting results for low surface brightness targets, such as stellar streams around nearby galaxies that are not resolved into stars.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了四重透镜的夸萨尔星系的选择效应和对哈勃常数的影响。文章指出四重透镜只有在其位于透镜星系的钻石焦散线内时才发生。这会导致观测到的四重透镜夸萨尔星系的选择效应，高估了真实的焦散区域。并且文章提到了Malmquist的修正可以补偿参数优化中未能将先验因素纳入计算的失败。另外，推断的时间延迟与透镜星系的推断焦散区域成正比。模型时间延迟的偏差长，导致哈勃常数被高估。由于选择效应和模型放大率错误的组合产生了“推断放大率偏差”。这些效应可以被内置为先验，但在实践中可能具有挑战性。 <div>
Quasars are quadruply lensed only when they lie within the diamond caustic of a lensing galaxy. This precondition produces a Malmquist-like selection effect in observed populations of quadruply lensed quasars, overestimating the true caustic area. The bias toward high values of the inferred logarithmic area, , is proportional to the square of the error in that area, . In effect, Malmquist’s correction compensates posthoc for a failure to incorporate a prior into parameter optimization. Inferred time delays are proportional to the square root of the inferred caustic area of the lensing galaxy. Model time delays are biased long, leading to overestimates of the Hubble constant. Crude estimates of for a sample of 13 quadruple systems give a median value of 0.16. We identify a second effect, an “inferred magnification bias,” resulting from the combination of selection by apparent magnitude and errors in model magnification. It is strongly anticorrelated with caustic area bias, and almost always leads to underestimates of the Hubble constant. Malmquist’s scheme can be adapted to priors on multiple parameters, but for quad lenses, the negative covariances between caustic area and absolute magnitude are poorly known. Inferred magnification bias may even cancel out caustic area bias, depending upon (among other things) the slope of the number–magnitude relation for the sample. Proper correction for these combined effects can, in principle, be built into Bayesian modeling schemes as priors, eliminating the need for a Malmquist-style approximation, but is likely to be challenging in practice.

Ice chemistry in the dense, cold interstellar medium (ISM) is probably responsible for the formation of interstellar complex organic molecules (COMs). Recent laboratory experiments performed at T ∼ 4 K have shown that irradiation of CO:N2 ice samples analog to the CO-rich interstellar ice layer can contribute to the formation of COMs when H2 molecules are present. We have tested this organic chemistry under a broader range of conditions relevant to the interior of dense clouds by irradiating CO:15N2:H2 ice samples with 2 keV electrons in the 4–15 K temperature range. The H2 ice abundance depended on both, the ice formation temperature and the thermal evolution of the samples. Formation of H-bearing organics such as formaldehyde (H2CO), ketene (C2H2O), and isocyanic acid (H15NCO) was observed upon irradiation of ice samples formed at temperatures up to 10 K, and also in ices formed at 6 K and subsequently warmed up and irradiated at temperatures up to 15 K. These results suggest that a fraction of the H2 molecules in dense cloud interiors might be entrapped in the CO-rich layer of interstellar ice mantles, and that energetic processing of this layer could entail an additional contribution to the formation of COMs in the coldest regions of the ISM.

Atmospheric escape is crucial to understanding the evolution of planets in and out of the solar system and to interpreting atmospheric observations. While hydrodynamic escape simulations have been actively developed incorporating detailed processes such as UV heating, chemical reactions, and radiative cooling, the radiative cooling by molecules has been treated as emission from selected lines or rotational/vibrational bands to reduce its numerical cost. However, ad hoc selections of radiative lines would risk estimating inaccurate cooling rates because important lines or wavelengths for atmospheric cooling depend on emitting conditions such as temperature and optical thickness. In this study, we apply the correlated-k distribution (CKD) method to cooling rate calculations for H2-dominant transonic atmospheres containing H2O or CO as radiative species, to investigate its numerical performance and the importance of considering all lines of the molecules. Our simulations demonstrate that the sum of weak lines, which provides only 1% of the line emission energy in total at optically thin conditions, can become the primary source of radiative cooling in optically thick regions, especially for H2O-containing atmospheres. Also, in our hydrodynamic simulations, the CKD method with a wavelength resolution of 1000 is found to be effective, allowing the calculation of escape rate and temperature profiles with acceptable numerical cost. Our results show the importance of treating all radiative lines and the usefulness of the CKD method in hydrodynamic escape simulations. It is particularly practical for heavy-element-enriched atmospheres considered in small exoplanets, including super-Earths, without any prior selections for effective lines.

<div> 关键词: coronal heating problem, coronal rain, Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS), plasma composition, Doppler velocity measurements

总结:
在研究太阳日冕加热问题时，我们通常只能观测到活跃区环的冷却阶段。然而，通过Hinode/EUV成像光谱仪(EIS)的罕见观测，我们得以观察到了X2.1型耀斑后日冕雨的形成过程。通过对等离子体成分的测量，我们发现了日冕雨形成的迹象。此外，通过多种测量手段，我们还观察到了日冕雨的形成和演化过程。这些观测为我们提供了关于日冕雨加热速率、来源和集体行为的新见解。在观测中还发现了日冕雨的一些特性，如在0.7MK时的窄温度分布。这些观测为解决日冕加热问题提供了重要线索。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
A significant impediment to solving the coronal heating problem is that we currently only observe active region loops in their cooling phase. Previous studies showed that the evolution of cooling loop densities and apex temperatures is insensitive to the magnitude, duration, and location of energy deposition. Still, potential clues to how energy is released are encoded in the properties of the cooling phase. The appearance of coronal rain, one of the most spectacular phenomena of the cooling phase, occurs when plasma has cooled below 1 MK, which sets constraints on the heating frequency, for example. Most observations of coronal rain have been made by imaging instruments. Here we report rare Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) observations of a loop arcade where coronal rain forms following an X2.1 limb flare. A bifurcation in plasma composition measurements between photospheric at 1.5 MK and coronal at 3.5 MK suggests that we are observing postflare-driven coronal rain. Increases in nonthermal velocities and densities with decreasing temperature (2.7–0.6 MK) suggest that we are observing the formation and subsequent evolution of the condensations. Doppler velocity measurements imply that a 10% correction of apparent flows in imaging data is reasonable. Emission measure analysis at 0.7 MK shows narrow temperature distributions, indicating coherent behavior reminiscent of that observed in coronal loops. The limitations on spatio-temporal resolution of EIS suggest that we are observing the largest features or rain showers. These observations provide insights into the heating rate, source, turbulence, and collective behavior of coronal rain from observations of the loop cooling phase.

<div> AGN, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Portsmouth group, forbidden line ratio, photoionization modeling
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章从Sloan Digital Sky Survey天体目录中选择了1437个活动星系核，并比较了各种禁止线的流量。研究了两种不依赖于Hα的禁止线比诊断图，并利用光电离建模来验证了诊断图的有效性。通过引入光度截断来减少星形成星系对AGN的干扰。最终，他们使用新的诊断图成功地将AGN分类到z≤1.06，并增加了822个新的AGN样本。 <div>
We select a sample of 1437 active galactic nuclei (AGN) from the catalog of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxy properties from the Portsmouth group by detection of the high-ionization [Ne v] 3426 Å emission line. We compare the fluxes of [Ne III] 3869 Å, [O III] 5007 Å, [O II] 3726, 3728 Å, and [O i] 6300 Å to that of [Ne v]. All four lines show a strong linear correlation with [Ne v], although lines from ions with lower ionization potentials have a lower correlation coefficient. We investigate the use of two forbidden line ratio diagnostic diagrams that do not rely on Hα in order to classify high-redshift galaxies. These use the [Ne III]/[O II] line ratio plotted against [O III]/[O i] and [O III]/[O II], respectively. We use photoionization modeling to characterize the behavior of the narrow-line region in AGN and star-forming regions and test the validity of our diagnostic diagrams. We also use a luminosity cutoff of log L[O III] [erg s−1] = 42, which lowers the contamination of the AGN region by star-forming galaxies down to 10% but does not remove green pea and purple grape galaxies from the AGN region. We also investigate the OHNO diagram, which uses [Ne III]/[O II] plotted against [O III]/Hβ. Using our new diagnostic diagrams, we are able to reliably classify AGN up to a redshift of z ≤ 1.06 and add more than 822 new AGN to the [Ne v]-selected AGN sample.

We compare, with data from quasars, Hubble parameter measurements, and Pantheon+ type Ia supernova, three different relations between X-ray luminosity (LX) and ultraviolet luminosity (LUV) of quasars. These three relations consist of the standard and two redshift-evolutionary LX–LUV relations, which are constructed, respectively, by considering a redshift-dependent correction to the luminosities of quasars and using the statistical tool copula. By employing the PAge approximation for a cosmological model–independent description of the cosmic background evolution and dividing the quasar data into the low-redshift and high-redshift parts, we find that the constraints on the PAge parameters from the low-redshift and high-redshift data, which are obtained with the redshift-evolutionary relations, are consistent with each other, while they are not when the standard relation is considered. If the data are used to constrain the coefficients of the relations and the PAge parameters simultaneously, then the observations support the redshift-evolutionary relations at more than 3σ. The Akaike and Bayes information criteria indicate that there is strong evidence against the standard relation and mild evidence against the redshift-evolutionary relation constructed by considering a redshift-dependent correction to the luminosities of quasars. This suggests that the redshift-evolutionary LX–LUV relation of quasars constructed from copula is favored by the observations.

<title>Absorption Troughs of Lyα Emitters in HETDEX</title>

该文介绍了HETDEX项目，旨在探测和测量超过100万个Lyα发射星系的红移，从而得出宇宙学测量数据，并研究Lyα光谱和辐射传输的基本特性。通过HETDEX数据发布3中的50万个LAEs，研究人员对不同子集进行堆叠，得出了z∼2–3时代典型的Lyα谱线，并了解了它们的物理特性。他们发现Lyα发射周围清晰的吸收翼，红蓝两侧均延伸∼2000 km/s。同时，通过COS和MUSE调查，他们观察到不同红移范围内的吸收谱线，并发现槽在高密度区域更加明显，说明吸收深度取决于LAE附近的局部密度。简单的Lyα辐射传输模拟也产生了类似的槽，这是由LAE周围的H i气体吸收背景光造成的。 
<br /><br />总结: 该研究通过HETDEX项目找到了z∼2–3时代典型的Lyα谱线，发现了吸收翼的特性，并观察到了吸收谱线与密度的关联。通过简单模拟，也验证了H i气体对光的吸收会产生类似的效应。 <div>
The Hobby–Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) is designed to detect and measure the redshifts of more than 1 million Lyα emitting galaxies (LAEs) 1.88 < z < 3.52. In addition to its cosmological measurements, these data enable studies of Lyα spectral profiles and the underlying radiative transfer. Using the roughly half a million LAEs in the HETDEX Data Release 3, we stack various subsets to obtain the typical Lyα profile for the z ∼ 2–3 epoch and to understand their physical properties. We find clear absorption wings around Lyα emission, which extend ∼2000 km s−1 both redward and blueward of the central line. Using far-UV spectra of nearby (0.002 < z < 0.182) LAEs in the COS Legacy Archive Spectroscopic Survey treasury and optical/near-IR spectra of 2.8 < z < 6.7 LAEs in the Multi Unit Spectroscopic-Wide survey, we observe absorption profiles in both redshift regimes. Dividing the sample by volume density shows that the troughs increase in higher-density regions. This trend suggests that the depth of the absorption is dependent on the local density of objects near the LAE, a geometry that is similar to damped Lyα systems. Simple simulations of Lyα radiative transfer can produce similar troughs due to absorption of light from background sources by H i gas surrounding the LAEs.

<div> 黑洞自旋参数；X射线双星；LMC X-1；尼科尔斯观测望远镜；恒星质量黑洞

总结:
本研究利用NICER和NuSTAR的最新同时观测数据，通过改进的科研方法对黑洞的自旋参数进行测量。首先使用标准相对论盘模型和光学薄的康普顿散射模型得到与以往相似的自旋参数数值。然后考虑了标准模型的修正，使用颜色校正得到了不同的自旋参数范围。进一步考虑了盘面层的能量耗散，假设标准盘被一个温暖且光学厚的康普顿散射层覆盖。最终得到了一个最小的χ2值对应的自旋参数范围。接着，我们对银河系X-1进行了相似的研究，结果表明，使用连续谱方法测量自旋参数极其敏感于对盘结构的假设。 <div>
The black hole spin parameter, a*, was measured to be close to its maximum value of 1 in many accreting X-ray binaries. In particular, a* ≳ 0.9 was found in a number of studies of LMC X-1. These measurements were claimed to take into account both statistical and systematic uncertainties. We perform new measurements using a recent simultaneous observation by NICER and NuSTAR, providing a data set of high quality. We use the disk continuum method together with improved models for coronal Comptonization. With the standard relativistic disk model and optically thin Comptonization, we obtain values of a* similar to those obtained before. We then consider modifications to the standard model. Using a color correction of 2, we find a* ≈ 0.64–0.84. We then consider disks with dissipation in surface layers. To account for that, we assume the standard disk is covered by a warm and optically thick Comptonizing layer. Our model with the lowest χ2 then yields . In order to test the presence of such effects in other sources, we also study an X-ray observation of Cyg X-1 by Suzaku in the soft state. We confirm the previous findings of a* > 0.99 using the standard model, but then we find a weakly constrained when including an optically thick Comptonizing layer. We conclude that determinations of the spin using the continuum method can be highly sensitive to the assumptions about the disk structure.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The galaxy cluster A746 (z = 0.214), featuring a double radio relic system, two isolated radio relics, a possible radio halo, disturbed V-shaped X-ray emission, and intricate galaxy distributions, is a unique and complex merging system. We present a weak-lensing analysis of A746 based on wide-field imaging data from Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam observations. The mass distribution is characterized by a main peak, which coincides with the center of the X-ray emission. At this main peak, we detect two extensions toward the north and west tracing the cluster galaxy and X-ray distributions. Despite the ongoing merger, our estimate of the A746 global mass M500 = 4.4 ± 1.0 × 1014M⊙ is consistent with the previous results from Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and X-ray observations. We conclude that reconciling the distributions of mass, galaxies, and intracluster medium with the double radio relic system and other radio features remains challenging.

<title>Including Neutrino-driven Convection in the Force Explosion Condition to Predict Explodability of Multidimensional Core-collapse Supernovae (FEC+)</title>

Most massive stars end their lives with core collapse. However, it is not clear which explode as a core-collapse supernova (CCSN), leaving behind a neutron star, and which collapse to a black hole, aborting the explosion. One path to predict explodability without expensive multidimensional simulations is to develop analytic explosion conditions. These analytic conditions also provide a deeper understanding of the explosion mechanism and they provide some insight into why some simulations explode and some do not. The analytic force explosion condition (FEC) reproduces the explosion conditions of spherically symmetric CCSN simulations. In this follow-up manuscript, we include the dominant multidimensional effect that aids explosion—neutrino-driven convection—in the FEC. This generalized critical condition (FEC+) is suitable for multidimensional simulations and has potential to accurately predict explosion conditions of two- and three-dimensional CCSN simulations. We show that adding neutrino-driven convection reduces the critical condition by ∼30%, which is consistent with previous multidimensional simulations.

在当前JWST时代，UV光谱对于增进我们对复离子时代（z > 6）中第一批星系的星际介质（ISM）和恒星特性的理解起着至关重要的作用。本文利用HST COS Legacy Archive Spectroscopic SurveY（CLASSY）中的远紫外线（UV）光谱数据，比较了光学图谱和UV图谱之间的关系，分析了在不同UV诊断图中的UV线比的位置，并考虑了最新的光电离和激波模型，以及已测得的ISM和恒星特性。研究发现，C iii] λλ1907,9 He iiλ1640和O iii] λ1666的组合可以在次太阳金属丰度条件下有效区分星际介质的形成源。此外，文中还讨论了检测UV发射线所需的ISM条件，强调了它们仅在低气相金属丰度（12 + log(O/H) ≲ 8.3）和高电离参数（log(U) ≳ −2.5）的环境中可见。总的来说，CLASSY和UV工具将在解释JWST目前正在揭示的最早星系的光谱方面发挥关键作用。<br /><br />总结: 本文利用CLASSY收集的大量UV光谱数据，比较了UV和光学图谱之间的关系，分析了UV线比的位置，并讨论了检测UV发射线所需的ISM条件。研究发现特定的UV线比组合可以区分不同形成源，而UV发射线仅在特定环境下可见。这将对解释JWST发现的早期星系的光谱起到关键作用。 <div>
In the current JWST era, rest-frame UV spectra play a crucial role in enhancing our understanding of the interstellar medium (ISM) and stellar properties of the first galaxies in the epoch of reionization (z > 6). Here, we compare well-known and reliable optical diagrams sensitive to the main ionization source (i.e., star formation, SF; active galactic nuclei, AGN; and shocks) to UV counterparts proposed in the literature—the so-called “UV–BPT diagrams”—using the HST COS Legacy Archive Spectroscopic SurveY (CLASSY), which is the largest high-quality, high-resolution, and broad-wavelength range atlas of far-UV spectra for 45 local star-forming galaxies. In particular, we explore where CLASSY UV line ratios are located in the different UV diagnostic plots, taking into account state-of-the-art photoionization and shock models, and, for the first time, the measured ISM and stellar properties (e.g., gas-phase metallicity, ionization parameter, carbon abundance, and stellar age). We find that the combination of C iii] λλ1907,9 He iiλ1640 and O iii] λ1666 can be a powerful tool to separate between SF, shocks, and AGN at subsolar metallicities. We also confirm that alternative diagrams without O iii] λ1666 still allow us to define an SF-locus, with some caveats. Diagrams including C ivλλ1548,51 should be taken with caution given the complexity of this doublet profile. Finally, we present a discussion detailing the ISM conditions required to detect UV emission lines, visible only in low gas-phase metallicity (12 + log(O/H) ≲ 8.3) and high ionization parameter (log(U) ≳ −2.5) environments. Overall, CLASSY and our UV toolkit will be crucial in interpreting the spectra of the earliest galaxies that JWST is currently revealing.

这篇文章总结了针对COSMOS-Web宝库项目的JWST NIRCam成像数据进行了详细和全面的数据降维和点扩散函数（PSF）模型构建。研究发现NIRCam PSF在四个滤波器（F115W，F150W，F277W和F444W）中存在显著的短时间尺度的时间变化和随机空间变化。通过将NIRCam与哈勃太空望远镜成像数据结合起来，进行多波段活动星系核（AGN）+宿主图像分解，研究了0.35 ≲ z ≲ 3.5的143个X射线选择的宽线AGN的特性。研究利用NIRCam出色的分辨率、波长覆盖和灵敏度，成功在142个对象中分解出中心AGN点源后检测到宿主恒星发射。约2/3的AGN位于星成形星系中，表明没有即时的负面AGN反馈。X射线选择的宽线AGN宿主遵循与非活跃星系类似的恒星质量-尺寸关系，尽管其星系大小略小。研究发现，尽管主要并合在样本中很少（约7%–22%），但来自恒星棒、螺旋臂和小并合等更微妙的非轴对称特征是普遍存在的，突出了非周期过程和小并合在触发AGN活动中的重要性。对于具有来自单一时期光谱的黑洞质量测量的30个AGN子样本（1 < z < 2.5），它们遵循与当地非活跃早期星系相似的黑洞质量-恒星质量关系，但更倾向于驻留在附近AGN的上限。需要注意的是，不同红移下的AGN种群的固有差异可能会显着影响它们在黑洞质量-恒星质量平面上的位置。

We present detailed and comprehensive data reduction and point-spread-function (PSF) model construction for all public JWST NIRCam imaging data from the COSMOS-Web treasury program (up to 2023 June, totaling 0.28 deg2). We show that the NIRCam PSF has significant short-timescale temporal variations and random spatial variations in all four filters (F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W). Combining NIRCam with archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging, we perform multiwavelength active galactic nucleus (AGN)+host image decomposition to study the properties of 143 X-ray-selected (Lbol = 1043.6–47.2 erg s−1) broad-line AGNs at 0.35 ≲ z ≲ 3.5. Leveraging the superb resolution, wavelength coverage, and sensitivity of NIRCam, we successfully detect host stellar emission after decomposing the central AGN point source in 142 objects. ∼2/3 AGNs are in star-forming galaxies based on the UVJ diagram, suggesting that there is no instantaneous negative AGN feedback. X-ray-selected broad-line AGN hosts follow a similar stellar mass–size relation as inactive galaxies, albeit with slightly smaller galaxy sizes. We find that although major mergers are rare (∼7%–22%) among the sample, more subtle nonaxisymmetric features from stellar bars, spiral arms, and minor mergers are ubiquitous, highlighting the importance of secular processes and minor mergers in triggering AGN activity. For a subsample of 30 AGNs at 1 < z < 2.5 with black hole mass measurements from single epoch spectra, they follow a similar black hole mass-stellar mass relation as local inactive early-type galaxies but reside preferentially near the upper envelope of nearby AGNs. We caution that selection biases and the intrinsic differences of AGN populations at different redshifts may significantly affect their location on the black hole mass-stellar mass plane.

AU Microscopii (AU Mic) is an active 24 ± 3 Myr pre-main-sequence M dwarf in the stellar neighborhood (d = 9.7 pc) with a rotation period of 4.86 days. The two transiting planets orbiting AU Mic, AU Mic b and c, are warm sub-Neptunes on 8.5 and 18.9 day periods and are targets of interest for atmospheric observations of young planets. Here we study AU Mic’s unocculted starspots using ground-based photometry and spectra in order to complement current and future transmission spectroscopy of its planets. We gathered multicolor Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) 0.4 m SBIG photometry to study the star's rotational modulations and LCO Network of Robotic Echelle Spectrographs high-resolution spectra to measure the different spectral components within the integrated spectrum of the star, parameterized by three spectral components and their coverage fractions. We find AU Mic’s surface has at least two spectral components: a Tamb = K ambient photosphere and cool spots that have a temperature of Tspot = K, covering a globally averaged area of 39% ± 4% which increases and decreases by 5.1% ± 0.3% from the average throughout a rotation. We also detect a third flux component with a filling factor less than 0.5% and a largely uncertain temperature between 8500 and 10,000 K that we attribute to flare flux not entirely omitted when time averaging the spectra. We include measurements of spot characteristics using a two-temperature model, which we find agree strongly with the three-temperature results. Our expanded use of various techniques to study starspots will help us better understand this system and may have applications for interpreting the transmission spectra for exoplanets transiting stars of a wide range of activity levels.

<div> 高光谱分辨率观测, NGC 1275, 均匀速度分散, 离子化气体, 高速度分散<br /><br />总结:本文报告了对Perseus星系团中心星系NGC 1275周围丝状星云的新高光谱分辨率观测。观测结果显示存在一个核心区域内的明亮扁平盘状结构，在X射线腔内形成了更湍动的多相气体，而在核心区域扩散了更稳定的大尺度多相气体。 <div>
We present new high-spectral-resolution observations (R = λ/Δλ = 7000) of the filamentary nebula surrounding NGC 1275, the central galaxy of the Perseus cluster. These observations have been obtained with SITELLE, an imaging Fourier transform spectrometer installed on the Canada–France–Hawai Telescope with a field of view of , encapsulating the entire filamentary structure of ionized gas despite its large size of 80 kpc × 50 kpc. Here, we present renewed fluxes, velocities, and velocity dispersion maps that show in great detail the kinematics of the optical nebula at [S ii] λ6716, [S ii] λ6731, [N ii] λ6584, Hα (6563 Å), and [N ii] λ6548. These maps reveal the existence of a bright flattened disk-shaped structure in the core extending to r ∼10 kpc and dominated by a chaotic velocity field. This structure is located in the wake of X-ray cavities and characterized by a high mean velocity dispersion of 134 km s−1. The disk-shaped structure is surrounded by an extended array of filaments spread out to r ∼ 50 kpc that are 10 times fainter in flux, remarkably quiescent, and have a uniform mean velocity dispersion of 44 km s−1. This stability is puzzling given that the cluster core exhibits several energetic phenomena. Based on these results, we argue that there are two mechanisms that form multiphase gas in clusters of galaxies: a first triggered in the wake of X-ray cavities leading to more turbulent multiphase gas and a second, distinct mechanism, that is gentle and leads to large-scale multiphase gas spreading throughout the core.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章讨论了银河团合并对粒子加速和加热机制的影响，提到了双射电遗迹系统ZWCL 1856.8，利用NuSTAR和Chandra观测到了其X射线和射电遗迹。分析结果显示了弱激波前缘和逆康普顿辐射的迹象，但由于暴露时间的限制，结果存在较大的不确定性。作者呼吁进行更深入的NuSTAR和Chandra观测，以研究射电和X射线辐射特征之间的联系，并限制该系统中热与非热辐射贡献的比例。同时，提出了使用NuSTAR和Chandra任务相互补充的特性来研究双残留系统的X射线特性的方法和途径。 <div>
Observations of galaxy cluster mergers provide insights on the particle acceleration and heating mechanisms taking place within the intracluster medium. Mergers form shocks that propagate through the plasma, which result in shock/cold fronts in the X-ray, and radio halos and/or relics in the radio regime. The connection between these tracers and the mechanisms driving non-thermal processes, such as inverse Compton, are not well understood. ZWCL 1856.8 is one of the few known double radio relic systems that originate from nearly head-on collisions observed close to the plane of the sky. For the first time, we study NuSTAR and Chandra observations of this system, which contains both relics within their field of view. The spectro-imaging analyses results of the system suggest weak shock fronts with numbers within 2σ of the radio-derived values, and provide evidence of inverse Compton emission at both relic sites. Our findings have great uncertainties due to the shallow exposure times available. Deeper NuSTAR and Chandra data are crucial for studying the connection of the radio and X-ray emission features and for constraining the thermal versus non-thermal emission contributions in this system. We also present methods and approaches on how to investigate X-ray properties of double relic systems by taking full advantage of the complementary properties of NuSTAR and Chandra missions.

总结:<br /><br />文章研究了星系周围介质中的湍流运动对星系演化的重要作用，利用[O ii]和[O iii]发射得到的二维速度图，测量了四个类星体星云的速度结构函数(VSF)。结果显示，这些星云中的气体呈次音速湍流，表明冷气体与热环境介质有动力学耦合。通过对八个星云进行研究，发现最大的星云位于星系团环境中，显示出明显的潮汐相互作用迹象，表明环境效应在促进星系气态晕及形成中起着重要作用。研究还估算了QSO星云中的湍流加热率，发现其值与星团介质和星际星云中的结果相符，但比使用吸收线技术在小尺度下测量的结果高出约103倍。作者讨论了通过将基于发射的VSF测量推进到小于约10千秒差距的前景。<br /> <div>
Turbulent motions in the circumgalactic medium play a critical role in regulating the evolution of galaxies, yet their detailed characterization remains elusive. Using two-dimensional velocity maps constructed from spatially extended [O ii] and [O iii] emission, Chen et al. measured the velocity structure functions (VSFs) of four quasar nebulae at z ≈ 0.5–1.1. One of these exhibits a spectacular Kolmogorov relation. Here, we carry out an ensemble study using an expanded sample incorporating four new nebulae from three additional quasi-stellar object (QSO) fields. The VSFs measured for all eight nebulae are best explained by subsonic turbulence revealed by the line-emitting gas, which in turn strongly suggests that the cool gas (T ∼ 104 K) is dynamically coupled to the hot ambient medium. Previous work demonstrates that the largest nebulae in our sample reside in group environments with clear signs of tidal interactions, suggesting that environmental effects are vital in seeding and enhancing the turbulence within the gaseous halos, ultimately promoting the formation of the extended nebulae. No discernible differences are observed in the VSF properties between radio-loud and radio-quiet QSO fields. We estimate the turbulent heating rate per unit volume, Qturb, in the QSO nebulae to be ∼10−26–10−22 erg cm−3 s−1 for the cool phase and ∼10−28–10−25 erg cm−3 s−1 for the hot phase. This range aligns with measurements in the intracluster medium and star-forming molecular clouds but is ∼103 times higher than the Qturb observed inside cool gas clumps on scales ≲1 kpc using absorption-line techniques. We discuss the prospect of bridging the gap between emission and absorption studies by pushing the emission-based VSF measurements to below ≈10 kpc.

这项研究利用了IXPE的长时间曝光来测量大麦哲伦星云中类似蟹星云的PSR B0540-69及其脉泽风星云的X射线偏振。对于图像平均数据未检测到有统计显著的偏振，给出了2-8keV能量范围下99%置信度的偏振上限为5.3%。然而，相相分析发现在4-6keV能量范围内，脉泽风星云和脉泽均存在偏振。对于脉泽风星云，偏振度为(24.5 ± 5.3)%，偏振角为(78.1 ± 6.2)°，在4.6σ的显著水平上检测到，在光学波段观测到的偏振角一致。对于单个脉冲窗口，在3.8σ的显著水平上测量到偏振度为(50.0 ± 13.1)%，偏振角为(6.2 ± 7.4)°。同时脉冲星/脉泽风星云分析发现，在脉冲的边缘有两个中超过3σ显著度的偏振度，为(68 ± 20)%和(62 ± 20)%；在2-3σ显著度上的相邻区间有较低的偏振度，暗示了额外的偏振结构。 
<br /><br />总结:PSR B0540-69和其脉泽风星云在X射线偏振测量中表现出复杂的特征，图像平均数据未检测到统计显著的偏振，但相相分析发现了偏振的存在，表明了该天体的X射线偏振具有丰富的结构和特性。 <div>
We report on X-ray polarization measurements of the extragalactic Crab-like PSR B0540-69 and its Pulsar Wind Nebula (PWN) in the Large Magellanic Cloud, using a ∼850 ks Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) exposure. The PWN is unresolved by IXPE. No statistically significant polarization is detected for the image-averaged data, giving a 99% confidence polarization upper limit (MDP99) of 5.3% in the 2–8 keV energy range. However, a phase-resolved analysis detects polarization for both the nebula and pulsar in the 4–6 keV energy range. For the PWN defined as the off-pulse phases, the polarization degree (PD) of (24.5 ± 5.3)% and polarization angle (PA) of (78.1 ± 6.2)° is detected at 4.6σ significance level, consistent with the PA observed in the optical band. In a single on-pulse window, a hint of polarization is measured at 3.8σ with PD of (50.0 ± 13.1)% and PA of (6.2 ± 7.4)°. A “simultaneous” PSR/PWN analysis finds two bins at the edges of the pulse exceeding 3σ PD significance, with PD of (68 ± 20)% and (62 ± 20)%; intervening bins at 2–3σ significance have lower PD, hinting at additional polarization structure.

通过Keck Cosmic Web Imager对14个位于z ≈ 2的damped Lyα吸收体周围的领域进行了Lyα积分场谱学研究。9个DLAs具有较高的金属丰度([M/H] > − 0.3)，其中4个在影响参数≲30 kpc处有CO发射星系。研究结果显示，这些高金属度DLA相关的H i选择星系可能存在较低的Lyα逃逸分数，证明了使用Lyα、CO、Hα和[C ii] 158μm发射来鉴定z ≈ 2 DLAs相关星系的必要性。除了与QSO B0551-366有关的场景外，在其余八个高金属度DLA领域中没有检测到显著的Lyα发射。综上所述，研究结果表明对于鉴定z ≈ 2 DLAs相关星系，需要综合多种方法。例如Lyα、CO、Hα和[C ii] 158μm发射。 <br /><br />总结: <br />DLAs对应的高金属度星系可能具有较低的Lyα逃逸分数。需要使用多种方法来识别z ≈ 2 DLAs相关的星系。 <div>
We present Keck Cosmic Web Imager Lyα integral field spectroscopy of the fields surrounding 14 damped Lyα absorbers (DLAs) at z ≈ 2. Of these 14 DLAs, nine have high metallicities ([M/H] > − 0.3), and four of those nine feature a CO-emitting galaxy at an impact parameter ≲30 kpc. Our search reaches median Lyα line flux sensitivities of ∼2 × 10−17 erg s−1 cm−2 over apertures of ∼6 kpc and out to impact parameters of ∼50 kpc. We recover the Lyα flux of three known Lyα-emitting H i-selected galaxies in our sample. In addition, we find two Lyα emitters at impact parameters of ≈50–70 kpc from the high-metallicity DLA at z ≈ 1.96 toward QSO B0551-366. This field also contains a massive CO-emitting galaxy at an impact parameter of ≈15 kpc. Apart from the field with QSO B0551-366, we do not detect significant Lyα emission in any of the remaining eight high-metallicity DLA fields. Considering the depth of our observations and our ability to recover previously known Lyα emitters, we conclude that H i-selected galaxies associated with high-metallicity DLAs at z ≈ 2 are dusty and therefore might feature low Lyα escape fractions. Our results indicate that complementary approaches—using Lyα, CO, Hα, and [C ii] 158 μm emission—are necessary to identify the wide range of galaxy types associated with z ≈ 2 DLAs.

<br /><br />
这篇文章主要介绍了Be星通过快速旋转和非径向脉动来建立分离盘的机制，以及这些盘中特征性的谱线发射的形成。文章指出，很多Be星有快速旋转的特性是由于与另一颗恒星的质量和角动量转移所导致的。通过对37颗Be星进行了光学/近红外干涉观测，并成功构建了六颗Be星与其伴星的三维轨道。此外，文章还指出了一些Be星并未发现低质量的伴星，同时也讨论了一些X射线原型星的可能伴星类型。 <div>
Rapid rotation and nonradial pulsations enable Be stars to build decretion disks, where the characteristic line emission forms. A major but unconstrained fraction of Be stars owe their rapid rotation to mass and angular momentum transfer in a binary. The faint, stripped companions can be helium-burning subdwarf OB-type stars (sdOBs), white dwarfs (WDs), or neutron stars. We present optical/near-infrared Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) interferometry of 37 Be stars selected for spectroscopic indications of low-mass companions. From multiepoch H- and/or K-band interferometry plus radial velocities and parallaxes collected elsewhere, we constructed 3D orbits and derived flux ratios and absolute dynamical masses of both components for six objects, quadrupling the number of anchor points for evolutionary models. In addition, a new wider companion was identified for the known Be + sdO binary 59 Cyg, while auxiliary Very Large Telescope Interferometer/GRAVITY spectrointerferometry confirmed circumstellar matter around the sdO companion to HR 2142. On the other hand, we failed to detect any companion to the six Be stars with γ Cas–like X-ray emission, with sdOB and main-sequence companions of the expected spectroscopic mass being ruled out for the X-ray-prototypical stars γ Cas and π Aqr, leaving elusive WDs as the most likely companions, as well as a likely explanation of the X-rays. No low-mass main-sequence close companions were identified for the other stars.

Transient low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are discovered largely by X-ray and gamma-ray all-sky monitors. The X-ray outburst is also accompanied by an optical brightening, which empirically can precede the detection of X-rays. Newly sensitive optical synoptic surveys may offer a complementary pathway for discovery and potential for insight into the initial onset and propagation of the thermal instability that leads to the ionization of the accretion disk. We use the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) alert stream to perform a comprehensive search at optical wavelengths for previously undiscovered outbursting LMXBs. Our pipeline first crossmatches the positions of the alerts to cataloged X-ray sources, and then analyzes the 30 day lightcurve of matched alerts by thresholding on differences with an 8 day exponentially weighted moving average. In addition to a 19 month long live search, we ran our pipeline over 4 yr of ZTF archival data, recovering four known LMXBs. We also independently detected an outburst of MAXI J1957+032 in the live search and found the first outburst of Swift J1943.4+0228, an unclassified X-ray transient, in 10 yr. Using Monte Carlo simulations of the Galactic LMXB population, we estimate that 29% of outbursting LMXBs are detectable by ZTF and that 4.4% of LMXBs would be present in the crossmatched X-ray catalogs, giving an estimated Galactic population of . We estimate that our current pipeline can detect 1.3% of all outbursting LMXBs, including those previously unknown, but that Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time will be able to detect 43% of outbursting LMXBs.

<div> 核心坍缩超新星 (CCSN) 模拟，三维，产生，核合成，多维效应

核心坍缩超新星 (CCSN) 模拟由 Fornax 进行，研究了 18 个三维模拟的喷射条件和理论核合成结果。大部分模拟在弹跳后至少进行了 3 秒的模拟，这使我们能够在长期内跟踪它们的行为。我们发现多维效应为喷射条件引入了许多复杂性。我们观察到随机的电子分数演化，复杂的峰值温度分布和历史，以及在核合成温度范围内所花费的时间的长尾分布。这些都导致了CCSN核合成产量的实质性变化，并且与一维结果有所不同。我们讨论了轻α-核、放射性同位素、重元素以及一些特别感兴趣的同位素的产生。通过比较CCSN之前和CCSN之后的贡献，我们发现在硅到锗之间大约产生的元素的相当一部分通常是在CCSNe中产生的。我们发现，与56Ni相比，44Ti表现出了较长的产生时间尺度，这可能解释了其在超新星遗迹如 Cas A 和 SN1987A中不同的分布和比先前预测的更高的丰度。我们还讨论了喷射元素的形态。这项研究凸显了三维CCSN模拟中喷射条件和核合成结果的高度多样性，并强调了需要进行额外的长期（约10秒）三维模拟以适当解决这些复杂性。<br /><br />总结: 本研究通过核心坍缩超新星模拟发现了多维效应引入的复杂性，包括随机的电子分数演化、复杂的峰值温度分布和历史，以及多维效应对核合成结果的实质性影响。研究还强调了进行更多长期的三维模拟以解决这些复杂性的必要性。 <div>
We study in detail the ejecta conditions and theoretical nucleosynthetic results for 18 three-dimensional core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations done by Fornax. Most of the simulations are carried out to at least 3 s after bounce, which allows us to follow their longer-term behaviors. We find that multidimensional effects introduce many complexities into the ejecta conditions. We see a stochastic electron fraction evolution, complex peak temperature distributions and histories, and long-tail distributions of the time spent within nucleosynthetic temperature ranges. These all lead to substantial variation in CCSN nucleosynthetic yields and differences from 1D results. We discuss the production of lighter α-nuclei, radioactive isotopes, heavier elements, and a few isotopes of special interest. Comparing pre-CCSN and CCSN contributions, we find that a significant fraction of elements between roughly Si and Ge are generally produced in CCSNe. We find that 44Ti exhibits an extended production timescale as compared to 56Ni, which may explain its different distribution and higher than previously predicted abundances in supernova remnants such as Cas A and SN1987A. We also discuss the morphology of the ejected elements. This study highlights the high-level diversity of ejecta conditions and nucleosynthetic results in 3D CCSN simulations and emphasizes the need for additional long-term (∼10 s) 3D simulations to properly address such complexities.

<div> 关键词: gas disk, binary system, eccentricity, instability, gravitational waves
总结: 
本研究发现围绕轨道二元系统的气体盘（所谓的微盘）可能会出现共振不稳定性，导致微盘变得极端偏心。通过数值模拟发现，微盘之间的定期碰撞在一定程度上导致并注入了偏心率。当使用等温状态方程时，微盘的偏心率会受到抑制。然而，即使在这种情况下，不稳定性仍然存在。此外，当引力软化程度较大时，微盘的偏心率也会受到抑制。研究指出，这种抑制可能是广泛采用的数值近似的一种人为因素。未来需要进行三维研究以评估偏心微盘是否可以在真实的天体物理环境中发生。如果是这样，这可能对区分活跃星系核中准周期振荡的双星和单黑洞情景的电磁标记具有重要意义。此外，可能有助于利用脉冲星定时阵列有针对性地搜索低频引力波来源于超大质量黑洞双星的情况。 <div>
We show that gas disks around the components of an orbiting binary system (so-called minidisks) may be susceptible to a resonant instability that causes the minidisks to become significantly eccentric. Eccentricity is injected by, and also induces, regular impacts between the minidisks at roughly the orbital period of the binary. Such eccentric minidisks are seen in vertically integrated, two-dimensional simulations of a circular, equal-mass binary accreting from a circumbinary gas disk with a Γ-law equation of state. Minidisk eccentricity is suppressed by the use of an isothermal equation of state. However, the instability still operates and can be revealed in a minimal disk-binary simulation by removing the circumbinary disk and feeding the minidisks from the component positions. Minidisk eccentricity is also suppressed when the gravitational softening length is large (≳4% of the binary semimajor axis), suggesting that its absence could be an artifact of widely adopted numerical approximations; a follow-up study in three dimensions with well-resolved, geometrically thin minidisks (aspect ratios ≲0.02) may be needed to assess whether eccentric minidisks can occur in real astrophysical environments. If they can, the electromagnetic signature may be important for discriminating between binary and single black hole scenarios for quasiperiodic oscillations in active galactic nuclei; in turn, this might aid in targeted searches with pulsar timing arrays for individual supermassive black hole binary sources of low-frequency gravitational waves.

这篇文章总结了首尔国立大学AGN监测项目（SAMP）开展的长期混响映射研究的主要结果。他们在2015年至2021年期间对32个明亮的活动星系核（AGN）进行了高质量数据的收集，并获得了Hβ发射和连续谱变化之间的时间延迟测量。研究还发现，从文献测量结果中得出的Hβ宽线区大小-亮度关系的斜率比先前报道的要平缓。此外，他们的测量时间滞后大多数短于预期，这意味着基于先前校准的单时黑洞质量估计器可能存在较大的系统误差。 <div>
We present the main results from a long-term reverberation mapping campaign carried out for the Seoul National University AGN Monitoring Project (SAMP). High-quality data were obtained during 2015–2021 for 32 luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs; i.e., continuum luminosity in the range of 1044–46 erg s−1) at a regular cadence, of 20–30 days for spectroscopy and 3–5 days for photometry. We obtain time lag measurements between the variability in the Hβ emission and the continuum for 32 AGNs; 25 of those have the best lag measurements based on our quality assessment, examining correlation strength and the posterior lag distribution. Our study significantly increases the current sample of reverberation-mapped AGNs, particularly at the moderate-to-high-luminosity end. Combining our results with literature measurements, we derive an Hβ broadline region size–luminosity relation with a shallower slope than reported in the literature. For a given luminosity, most of our measured lags are shorter than the expectations, implying that single-epoch black hole mass estimators based on previous calibrations could suffer large systematic uncertainties.

Molecular abundances in protoplanetary disks are highly sensitive to the local physical conditions, including gas temperature, gas density, radiation field, and dust properties. Often multiple factors are intertwined, impacting the abundances of both simple and complex species. We present a new approach to understanding these chemical and physical interdependencies using machine learning. Specifically, we explore the case of CO modeled under the conditions of a generic disk and build an explanatory regression model to study the dependence of CO spatial density on the gas density, gas temperature, cosmic-ray ionization rate, X-ray ionization rate, and UV flux. Our findings indicate that combinations of parameters play a surprisingly powerful role in regulating CO abundance compared to any singular physical parameter. Moreover, in general we find the conditions in the disk are destructive toward CO. CO depletion is further enhanced in an increased cosmic-ray environment and in disks with higher initial C/O ratios. These dependencies uncovered by our new approach are consistent with previous studies, which are more modeling intensive and computationally expensive. Our work thus shows that machine learning can be a powerful tool not only for creating efficient predictive models, but also for enabling a deeper understanding of complex chemical processes.

总结:
本研究提供了地球磁尾磁场中对小振幅压缩性磁流体动力学湍流级联有重要影响的碰撞阻尼(CD)调制的首次观测证据。研究使用了四个Cluster航天器，并基于改进的压缩性磁流体动力学分解算法，将湍流分解为三个本征模式：不可压阿尔文模式和可压缩的慢速和快速（磁音速）模式。观察结果表明，碰撞阻尼增强了可压缩磁流体动力学模式的各向异性，因为碰撞阻尼对波的传播角度有很强的依赖性。快速模式受到更显著的碰撞阻尼调制，具有一个微弱的、与尺度无关的各向异性。随着波数增加，快速模式的各向异性增强。因此，快速模式在可压缩模式的总能量中的比例随着垂直波数（相对于背景磁场）或波传播角度的增加而减少。我们的发现揭示了碰撞阻尼对湍流级联的形成方式以及其在空间环境中各向异性的影响。 <div>
Plasma turbulence is a ubiquitous dynamical process that transfers energy across many spatial and temporal scales and affects energetic particle transport. Recent advances in the understanding of compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence demonstrate the important role of damping in shaping energy distributions on small scales, yet its observational evidence is still lacking. This study provides the first observational evidence of substantial collisionless damping (CD) modulation on the small-amplitude compressible MHD turbulence cascade in Earth’s magnetosheath using four Cluster spacecraft. Based on an improved compressible MHD decomposition algorithm, turbulence is decomposed into three eigenmodes: incompressible Alfvén modes and compressible slow and fast (magnetosonic) modes. Our observations demonstrate that CD enhances the anisotropy of compressible MHD modes because CD has a strong dependence on wave propagation angle. The wavenumber distributions of slow modes are mainly stretched perpendicular to the background magnetic field (B0) and weakly modulated by CD. In contrast, fast modes are subjected to a more significant CD modulation. Fast modes exhibit a weak, scale-independent anisotropy above the CD truncation scale. Below the CD truncation scale, the anisotropy of fast modes enhances as wavenumbers increase. As a result, fast-mode fractions in the total energy of compressible modes decrease with the increase of perpendicular wavenumber (to B0) or wave propagation angle. Our findings reveal how the turbulence cascade is shaped by CD and its consequences for anisotropies in the space environment.

We present a 12CO(J = 2−1) survey of 60 local galaxies using data from the Atacama Compact Array as part of the Extragalactic Database for Galaxy Evolution: the ACA EDGE survey. These galaxies all have integral field spectroscopy from the CALIFA survey. Compared to other local galaxy surveys, ACA EDGE is designed to mitigate selection effects based on CO brightness and morphological type. Of the 60 galaxies in ACA EDGE, 36 are on the star formation main sequence, 13 are on the red sequence, and 11 lie in the “green valley” transition between these sequences. We test how star formation quenching processes affect the star formation rate (SFR) per unit molecular gas mass, SFEmol = SFR/Mmol, and related quantities in galaxies with stellar masses 10 ≤ log[M⋆/M⊙] ≤ 11.5 covering the full range of morphological types. We observe a systematic decrease of the molecular-to-stellar mass fraction ( ) with a decreasing level of star formation activity, with green valley galaxies also having lower SFEmol than galaxies on the main sequence. On average, we find that the spatially resolved SFEmol within the bulge region of green valley galaxies is lower than in the bulges of main-sequence galaxies if we adopt a constant CO-to-H2 conversion factor, αCO. While efficiencies in main-sequence galaxies remain almost constant with galactocentric radius, in green valley galaxies, we note a systematic increase of SFEmol, , and specific SFR with increasing radius. As shown in previous studies, our results suggest that although gas depletion (or removal) seems to be the most important driver of the star formation quenching in galaxies transiting through the green valley, a reduction in star formation efficiency is also required during this stage.

总结: 
本研究旨在探索高能辐射对矿物云颗粒聚集和带电状态的影响。实验结果表明，在高湿度环境下，gamma辐射显著增加颗粒的负电荷状态，同时抑制颗粒的聚集形成。而在低湿度环境下，gamma辐射对颗粒的带电状态也有显著影响，但对聚集形成的抑制效果不及在高湿度环境下。因此，高能辐射可能有利于形成大量的小颗粒而非少量的大颗粒。这些发现对于理解行星大气中的云颗粒具有重要意义，特别是考虑到宿主恒星的辐射环境不同，这些研究有助于更好地理解外行星大气的特性。<br /><br /> <div>
It is known from Earth that ionizing high-energy radiation can lead to ion-induced nucleation of cloud condensation nuclei in the atmosphere. Since the amount of high-energy radiation can vary greatly based on the radiative environment of a host star, understanding the effect of high-energy radiation on cloud particles is critical to understand exoplanet atmospheres. This study aims to explore how high-energy radiation affects the aggregation and charging of mineral cloud particles. We present experiments conducted in an atmosphere chamber on mineral SiO2 particles with diameters of 50 nm. The particles were exposed to gamma radiation in either low-humidity (RH ≈ 20%) or high-humidity (RH > 50%) environments. The aggregation and charging state of the particles were studied with a scanning mobility particle sizer. We find that the single SiO2 particles (N1) cluster to form larger aggregates (N2–N4), and that this aggregation is inhibited by gamma radiation. We find that gamma radiation shifts the charging of the particles to become more negative by increasing the charging state of negatively charged particles. Through an independent t-test, we find that this increase is statistically significant within a 5% significance level for all aggregates in the high-humidity environment and all except the N1 particles in the low-humidity environment. For the positively charged particles, the changes in charging state are not within the 5% significance level. We suggest that the overall effect of gamma radiation could favor the formation of a high number of small particles over a lower number of larger particles.

总结:
太阳耀斑会在光球层的磁场上留下印记，研究旨在通过垂直Lorentz力的变化来区分爆发性和局限性太阳耀斑。研究选取了26个爆发性和11个局限性主要太阳耀斑（强度超过GOES M5级）并分析了这些耀斑区域的磁场。结果显示，在耀斑极性反转线周围区域，水平磁场迅速增加，伴随着相同区域中下行Lorentz力的显著变化。所有局限性事件表现出的Lorentz力变化总量都小于1.8×1022dyn，这一阈值在有效区分爆发性和局限性太阳耀斑中起重要作用。此外，分析结果表明，总Lorentz力的变化还取决于太阳冠层中的重连接高度。这些结果对于理解与耀斑相关的向上脉冲传输以及相关的日冕物质抛射具有重要意义。 <div>
Solar flares are known to leave imprints on the magnetic field in the photosphere, often manifested as an abrupt and permanent change in the downward-directed Lorentz force in localized areas inside the active region. Our study aims to differentiate eruptive and confined solar flares based on the variations in vertical Lorentz force. We select 26 eruptive and 11 confined major solar flares (stronger than the GOES M5 class) observed during 2011–2017. We analyze these flaring regions using SHARP vector magnetograms obtained from NASA’s Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager. We also compare data corresponding to two synthetic flares from a δ-sunspot simulation reported by Chatterjee et al. We estimate the change in the horizontal magnetic field and the total Lorentz force integrated over an area around the polarity inversion line (PIL) that encompasses the location of the flare. Our results indicate a rapid increase in the horizontal magnetic field along the flaring PIL, accompanied by a significant change in the downward-directed Lorentz force in the same vicinity. Notably, we find that all the confined events under study exhibit a total change in Lorentz force of <1.8 × 1022 dyn. This threshold plays an important role in effectively distinguishing eruptive and confined flares. Further, our analysis suggests that the change in total Lorentz force also depends on the reconnection height in the solar corona at the associated flare onset. The results provide significant implications for understanding the flare-related upward impulse transmission for the associated coronal mass ejection.

The analysis of gamma-ray burst (GRB) spectra often relies on empirical models lacking a distinct physical explanation. Previous attempts to couple physical models with observed data focus on individual burst studies, fitting models to segmented spectra with independent physical parameters. However, these approaches typically neglect to explain the time evolution of observed spectra. In this study, we propose a novel approach by incorporating the synchrotron radiation model to provide a self-consistent explanation for a selection of single-pulse GRBs. Our study comprehensively tests the synchrotron model under a unified physical condition, such as a single injection event of electrons. By tracing the evolution of cooling electrons in a decaying magnetic field, our model predicts time-dependent observed spectra that align well with the data. Using a single set of physical parameters, our model successfully fits all time-resolved spectra within each burst. Our model suggests that the rising phase of the GRB light curve results from the increasing number of radiating electrons, while the declining phase is attributed to the curvature effect, electron cooling, and the decaying magnetic field. Our model provides a straightforward interpretation of the peak energy’s evolution, linked to the decline of the magnetic field and electron cooling due to the expansion of the GRB emission region. Our findings strongly support the notion that spectral and temporal evolution in GRB pulses originates from the expansion of the GRB emission region, with an initial radius of approximately 1015 cm, and synchrotron radiation as the underlying emission mechanism.

Recent results from spectroscopic and astrometric surveys of nearby stars suggest that the stellar disk of our Milky Way (MW) was formed quite early, within the first few billion years of its evolution. Chemokinematic signatures of disk formation in cosmological zoom-in simulations appear to be in tension with these data, implying that MW-like disk formation is delayed in simulations. We investigate the formation of galactic disks using a representative sample of MW-like galaxies from the cosmological volume simulation TNG50. We find that on average MW-mass disks indeed form later than the local data suggest. However, their formation time and metallicity exhibit a substantial scatter, such that ∼10% of MW-mass galaxies form disks early, similar to the MW. Thus, although the MW is unusual, it is consistent with the overall population of MW-mass disk galaxies. The direct MW analogs assemble most of their mass early, ≳10 Gyr ago, and are not affected by destructive mergers after that. In addition, these galaxies form their disks during the early enrichment stage when the interstellar medium metallicity increases rapidly, with only ∼25% of early-forming disks being as metal-poor as the MW was at the onset of disk formation, [Fe/H] ≈ −1.0. In contrast, most MW-mass galaxies either form disks from already enriched material or experience late destructive mergers that reset the signatures of galactic disk formation to later times and higher metallicities. Finally, we also show that earlier disk formation leads to more dominant rotationally supported stellar disks at redshift zero.

As stars evolve to higher luminosities during first ascension of the giant branch, previously frozen terrestrial worlds may thaw and host liquid water on their surfaces. Eventually these outer worlds again become uninhabitable due to receiving too much incident light and their water inventory evaporating. Solar-mass stars experience a sudden decrease in luminosity entering the horizontal branch, which could result in a secondary habitable phase for their outer worlds. The outer worlds’ time with habitable surface climates is key in evaluating the possibility of extraterrestrial life arising. The times inside the habitable zone (TIHZ) are calculated for outer worlds orbiting between 5 and 45 au around a Sun-like star. By comparing the TIHZ to time estimates for life to arise on Earth, we evaluate whether such outer worlds are promising candidates in the search for extraterrestrial life. We use two different solar evolution models (PARSEC and Dartmouth) and both optimistic and conservative habitable zone (HZ) definitions. Multiple habitable phases are found for each outer world. Outer worlds with orbits as large as Saturn are found to have a secondary habitable phase which exceeds the first in duration. Generally, the time inside the HZ is found to decrease almost monotonically with orbiting distance. Water loss is calculated after the first habitable phase to determine whether a secondary habitable phase is possible. For all orbiting distances the water loss is insufficient to deplete a water inventory equivalent to that of many moons in the outer solar system.

In this paper, we present updated estimates of the velocity of the neutron star (NS) in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A using over two decades of Chandra observations. We use two methods: (1) recording the NS positions from dozens of Chandra observations, including the astrometric uncertainty estimates on the data points, but not correcting the astrometry of the observations; and (2) correcting the astrometry of the 13 Chandra observations that have a sufficient number of point sources with identified Gaia counterparts. For method #1, we observe a heliocentric velocity of 275 ± 121 km s−1, with an angle of 177° ± 22° east of north. For method #2, we observe a heliocentric velocity of 436 ± 89 km s−1 at an angle of 158° ± 12°. Correcting for galactic rotation and the Sun’s peculiar motion decreases these estimates to 256 km s−1 at 167° and 433 km s−1 at 151°, respectively. Both of our estimates match with the explosion-center-estimated velocity of ∼350 km s−1 and the previous 10 yr baseline proper-motion measurement of 570 ± 260 km s−1, but our use of additional data over a longer baseline has led to a smaller uncertainty by a factor of 2–3. Our estimates rule out velocities ≳600 km s−1 and better match with simulations of Cassiopeia A that include NS kick mechanisms.

研究分析了围绕银河系中心超大质量黑洞的S星团的轨道分布。发现了围绕近地点距离rp与轨道离心率e⋆之间的紧密依存关系，这不能简单地通过半长轴和离心率的随机分布来解释。没有发现在大e⋆和大rp区域或小e⋆和小rp区域有任何恒星。虽然样本仍很小，但G云显示了非常相似的分布。确定了确定S星的轨道参数的可能性。具有大e⋆和大rp的恒星的可能性非常小。S星可能存在于该区域。但是，要确定它们的轨道参数，需要在更长的时间段内进行观测。另一方面，如果存在小rp和小e⋆的恒星，则它们的轨道参数应该已经被确定。因此，这一区域的无星表明不存在具有这些轨道特征的S星，为它们的形成提供了约束。我们将这一由rp和e⋆定义的区域称为回避区。最后，结果表明，如果考虑到在回避区内没有恒星存在以及目前无法确定具有大rp和大e⋆的恒星的轨道参数这一事实，观测到的离心率和近地点距离的频率与对rp和e⋆的随机抽样是一致的。 <div>
The orbital distribution of the S-star cluster surrounding the supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way is analyzed. A tight dependence of the pericenter distance rp on orbital eccentricity e⋆ is found, , which cannot be explained simply by a random distribution of semimajor axis and eccentricities. No stars are found in the region with high e⋆ and large or in the region with low e⋆ and small . Although the sample is still small, the G-clouds show a very similar distribution. The likelihood to determine the orbital parameters of S-stars is determined. P is very small for stars with large e⋆ and large . S-stars might exist in this region. To determine their orbital parameters, one however needs observations over a longer time period. On the other hand, if stars would exist in the region of low and small e⋆, their orbital parameters should by now have been determined. That this region is unpopulated therefore indicates that no S-stars exist with these orbital characteristics, providing constraints for their formation. We call this region, defined by , the zone of avoidance. Finally, it is shown that the observed frequency of eccentricities and pericenter distances is consistent with a random sampling of and e⋆ if one takes into account the fact that no stars exist in the zone of avoidance and that orbital parameters cannot yet be determined for stars with large rp and large e⋆.

Spin period distribution provides important clues to understand the formation of millisecond pulsars (MSPs). To uncover the intrinsic period distribution, we analyze three samples of radio MSPs in the Galactic field and globular clusters. The selection bias due to pulse broadening has been corrected but turns out to be negligible. We find that all the samples can be well described by a Weibull distribution of spin frequencies. Considering MSPs in the Galactic field or globular clusters and in isolation or binary systems, we find no significant difference in the spin distribution among these subpopulations. Based on the current known population of MSPs, we find that submillisecond pulsars are unlikely to be discovered by the Square Kilometre Array, although up to ∼10 discoveries of pulsars that spin faster than the current record holder of P = 1.4 ms are expected.

We simulate a black hole accretion disk system with full-transport general relativistic neutrino radiation magnetohydrodynamics for 1.2 s. This system is likely to form after the merger of two compact objects and is thought to be a robust site of r-process nucleosynthesis. We consider the case of a black hole accretion disk arising from the merger of two neutron stars. Our simulation time coincides with the nucleosynthesis timescale of the r-process (∼1 s). Because these simulations are time-consuming, it is common practice to run for a “short” duration of approximately 0.1–0.3 s. We analyze the nucleosynthetic outflow from this system and compare the results of stopping at 0.12 and 1.2 s. We find that the addition of mass ejected in the longer simulation as well as more favorable thermodynamic conditions from emergent viscous ejecta greatly impacts the nucleosynthetic outcome. We quantify the error in nucleosynthetic outcomes between short and long cuts.

We present results from our 1000+ days monitoring campaign of AT 2019avd, a nuclear transient with tidal-disruption-event-like properties, with NICER, Swift, and Chandra. Our primary finding is that approximately 225 days following the peak of the X-ray emission, there is a rapid drop in luminosity exceeding 2 orders of magnitude. This X-ray dropoff is accompanied by X-ray spectral hardening, followed by a plateau phase of 740 days. During this phase, the spectral index decreases from 6.2 ± 1.1 to 2.3 ± 0.4, while the disk temperature remains constant. Additionally, we detect pronounced X-ray variability, with an average fractional rms amplitude of 47%, manifesting over timescales of a few dozen minutes. We propose that this phenomenon may be attributed to intervening clumpy outflows. The overall properties of AT 2019avd suggest that the accretion disk evolves from a super-Eddington to a sub-Eddington luminosity state, possibly associated with a compact jet. This evolution follows a pattern in the hardness–intensity diagram similar to that observed in stellar-mass BHs, supporting the mass invariance of accretion–ejection processes around BHs.

<title>Relativistic Effects on Circumbinary Disk Evolution: Breaking the Polar Alignment around Eccentric Black Hole Binary Systems</title>

We study the effects of general relativity (GR) on the evolution and alignment of circumbinary disks around binaries on all scales. We implement relativistic apsidal precession of the binary into the hydrodynamics code phantom. We find that the effects of GR can suppress the stable polar alignment of a circumbinary disk, depending on how the relativistic binary apsidal precession timescale compares to the disk nodal precession timescale. Studies of circumbinary disk evolution typically ignore the effects of GR, which is an appropriate simplification for low-mass or widely separated binary systems. In this case, polar alignment occurs, provided that the disks initial misalignment is sufficiently large. However, systems with a very short relativistic precession timescale cannot polar align and instead move toward coplanar alignment. In the intermediate regime where the timescales are similar, the outcome depends upon the properties of the disk. Polar alignment is more likely in the wavelike disk regime (where the disk viscosity parameter is less than the aspect ratio, α < H/r), since the disk is in good radial communication. In the viscous disk regime, disk breaking is more likely. Multiple rings can destructively interact with one another, resulting in short disk lifetimes and the disk moving toward coplanar alignment. Around main-sequence star or stellar mass black hole binaries, polar alignment may be suppressed far from the binary, but in general, the inner parts of the disk can align to polar. Polar alignment may be completely suppressed for disks around supermassive black holes for close binary separations.

<title>Magnetic Relaxation Seen in a Rapidly Evolving Light Bridge in a Sunspot</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report a magnetic relaxation process inside a sunspot associated with the evolution of a transient light bridge (LB). From high-resolution imaging and spectro-polarimetric data taken by the 1.6 m Goode Solar Telescope installed at Big Bear Solar Observatory, we observe the evolutionary process of a rapidly evolving LB. The LB is formed as a result of the strong intrusion of filamentary structures with relatively horizontal fields into the vertical umbral field region. A strong current density is detected along a localized region where the magnetic field topology changes rapidly in the sunspot, especially in the boundary region between the LB and the umbra, and bright jets are observed intermittently and repeatedly in the chromosphere along this region through magnetic reconnection. In the second half of our observation, the horizontal component of the magnetic field diminishes within the LB, and the typical convection structure within the sunspot, which manifests itself as umbral dots, is restored. Our findings provide a comprehensive perspective not only on the evolution of an LB itself but also on its impacts in the neighboring regions, including the chromospheric activity and the change of magnetic energy of a sunspot.

<title>The HST Nondetection of SN Ia 2011fe 11.5 yr after Explosion Further Restricts Single-degenerate Progenitor Systems</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the nearby Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2011fe obtained 11.5 yr after explosion. No emission is detected at the SN location to a 1σ (3σ) limit of F555W > 30.2 (29.0) mag, or equivalently MV > 1.2 (−0.1) mag, neglecting the distance uncertainty to M101. We constrain the presence of donor stars impacted by the SN ejecta with the strictest limits thus far on compact (i.e., ) companions. H-rich zero-age main-sequence companions with masses ≥2 M⊙ are excluded, a significant improvement upon the preexplosion imaging limit of ≈5 M⊙. Main-sequence He stars with masses ≥1.0 M⊙ and subgiant He stars with masses ≤0.8 M⊙ are also disfavored by our late-time imaging. Synthesizing our limits on postimpact donors with previous constraints from preexplosion imaging, early-time radio and X-ray observations, and nebular-phase spectroscopy, essentially all formation channels for SN 2011fe invoking a nondegenerate donor star at the time of explosion are unlikely.

<title>Revised Constraints on the Fast Radio Burst Population from the First CHIME/FRB Catalog</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this paper, we investigate the fast radio burst (FRB) population using the first CHIME/FRB catalog. We first reconstruct the extragalactic dispersion measure–redshift relation (DME–z relation) from well-localized FRBs, then use it to infer the redshift and isotropic energy of the first CHIME/FRB catalog. The intrinsic energy distribution is modeled by the power law with an exponential cutoff, and the selection effect of the CHIME telescope is modeled by a two-parametric function of specific fluence. For the intrinsic redshift distribution, the star formation history (SFH) model and five other SFH-related models are considered. We construct the joint likelihood of fluence, energy, and redshift, and all the free parameters are constrained simultaneously using the Bayesian inference method. The Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is used to choose the model that best matches the observational data. For comparison, we fit our models with two data samples, i.e., the Full sample and the Gold sample. The power-law index and cutoff energy are tightly constrained to be 1.8 ≲ α ≲ 1.9 and , which are almost independent of the redshift distribution model and the data sample we choose. The parameters involving the selection effect strongly depend on the data sample but are insensitive to the redshift distribution model. According to BIC, the pure SFH model is strongly disfavored by both the Full sample and Gold sample. For the other five SFH-related redshift distribution models, most of them can match the data well if the parameters are properly chosen. Therefore, with the present data, it is still premature to draw a conclusion on the FRB population.

总结：<br /><br />本文针对二进制黑洞群体进行了分析，首次明确拟合了次要质量分布。研究发现，数据表明存在一个约为30 M⊙的峰值，但仅存在于次要质量分布中，这对我们理解这些二进制系统的形成具有重要意义。另一方面，数据也支持这一峰值存在于两个组分的质量分布中，这是大多数以前研究未考虑的可能性。不论哪种情况，这一峰值的观测值都低于以前对主要质量分布的分析结果，这与脉冲对撞法超新星堆积的预期存在进一步的张力。 <div>
When modeling the population of merging binary black holes, analyses have generally focused on characterizing the distribution of primary (i.e., more massive) black holes in the binary, while using simplistic prescriptions for the distribution of secondary masses. However, the secondary mass distribution and its relationship to the primary mass distribution provide a fundamental observational constraint on the formation history of coalescing binary black holes. If both black holes experience similar stellar evolutionary processes prior to collapse, as might be expected in dynamical formation channels, the primary and secondary mass distributions would show similar features. If they follow distinct evolutionary pathways (for example, due to binary interactions that break symmetry between the initially more massive and less massive stars), their mass distributions may differ. We present the first analysis of the binary black hole population that explicitly fits for the secondary mass distribution. We find that the data is consistent with a ∼30 M⊙ peak existing only in the distribution of secondary rather than primary masses. This would have major implications for our understanding of the formation of these binaries. Alternatively, the data is consistent with the peak existing in both component mass distributions, a possibility not included in most previous studies. In either case, the peak is observed at , which is shifted lower than the value obtained in previous analyses of the marginal primary mass distribution, placing this feature in further tension with expectations from a pulsational pair-instability supernova pileup.

Variable accretion has been well studied in the evolved stages of low-mass star formation. However, the accretion history in the initial phases of star formation is still a seldom studied topic. The outflows and jets emerging from protostellar objects could shed some light on their accretion history. We consider the recently studied case of W43-MM1, a protocluster containing 46 outflows driven by 27 protostellar cores. The outflow kinematics of the individual cores and associated knots in W43-MM1 indicate episodic protostellar ejection. We take the observed parameters of an individual core system (core #8) and perform 3D hydrodynamic simulations of such a system, including episodic changes in the velocity of the outflow. The simulations consist of a collimated jet emerging from a core, taking into account one- and two-velocity modes in the variation of the ejection velocity of the jet. In addition, we investigated the effect of including the precession of the jet in the one- and two-velocity-mode models. From the simulations, we constructed position–velocity diagrams and compared them with the observations. We find that including a second mode in the ejection velocity, as well as the precession, are required to explain the positions of the outflow knots and other position–velocity features observed in core #8 in W43-MM1.

We present cosmological analysis of 12 nearby (z < 0.06) Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP) observed with the ROTSE-IIIb telescope. To achieve precise photometry, we present a new image-differencing technique that is implemented for the first time on the ROTSE SN photometry pipeline. With this method, we find up to a 20% increase in the detection efficiency and significant reduction in residual rms scatter of the SN lightcurves when compared to the previous pipeline performance. We use the published optical spectra and broadband photometry of well-studied SNe IIP to establish temporal models for ejecta velocity and photospheric temperature evolution for our SNe IIP population. This study yields measurements that are competitive with other methods even when the data are limited to a single epoch during the photospheric phase of SNe IIP. Using the fully reduced ROTSE photometry and optical spectra, we apply these models to the respective photometric epochs for each SN in the ROTSE IIP sample. This facilitates the use of the Expanding Photosphere Method (EPM) to obtain distance estimates to their respective host galaxies. We then perform cosmological parameter fitting using these EPM distances, from which we measure the Hubble constant to be , which is consistent with the standard ΛCDM model values derived using other independent techniques.

<title>Collapsars as Sites of r-process Nucleosynthesis: Systematic Photometric Near-infrared Follow-up of Type Ic-BL Supernovae</title>

<div> 关键词: GW170817, r-process elements, neutron star mergers, collapsars, supernovae Ic-BL
总结: <br /><br />这篇文章讨论了GW170817发现后的开放性问题，即中子星合并是否是产生r过程元素的唯一天体物理场所。他们对Ic-BL超新星进行了光度学研究，以确定这些爆炸中是否合成了多少量的r过程物质。通过使用半解析模型进行光度曲线拟合，他们得出的结果表明，在样本中没有发现任何强有力的r过程丰度迹象。未来的高频红外光度研究和星云光谱分析可能会对更小量的r过程排出物或显示所有collapsars是否完全缺乏r过程核生成提供敏感性。 <div>
One of the open questions following the discovery of GW170817 is whether neutron star (NS) mergers are the only astrophysical sites capable of producing r-process elements. Simulations have shown that 0.01–0.1 M⊙ of r-process material could be generated in the outflows originating from the accretion disk surrounding the rapidly rotating black hole that forms as a remnant to both NS mergers and collapsing massive stars associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts (collapsars). The hallmark signature of r-process nucleosynthesis in the binary NS merger GW170817 was its long-lasting near-infrared (NIR) emission, thus motivating a systematic photometric study of the light curves of broad-lined stripped-envelope (Ic-BL) supernovae (SNe) associated with collapsars. We present the first systematic study of 25 SNe Ic-BL—including 18 observed with the Zwicky Transient Facility and 7 from the literature—in the optical/NIR bands to determine what quantity of r-process material, if any, is synthesized in these explosions. Using semi-analytic models designed to account for r-process production in SNe Ic-BL, we perform light curve fitting to derive constraints on the r-process mass for these SNe. We also perform independent light curve fits to models without the r-process. We find that the r-process-free models are a better fit to the light curves of the objects in our sample. Thus, we find no compelling evidence of r-process enrichment in any of our objects. Further high-cadence infrared photometric studies and nebular spectroscopic analysis would be sensitive to smaller quantities of r-process ejecta mass or indicate whether all collapsars are completely devoid of r-process nucleosynthesis.

NGC 1087通过詹姆斯·韦伯空间望远镜近红外摄像机观测到微弱的非轴对称结构，且在星体速度图、Hα和CO J = 2 → 1速度场中观察到椭圆形畸变。这种结构仅在近红外的F200W和F300M波段滤波器下才能被发现。这种非轴对称结构类似于星体棒，但与传统的星体棒有显著差异。大部分近红外辐射集中在6″∼500 pc范围内，最大延伸达1.2 kpc。大尺度非圆形运动的空间延伸与星体棒重合，确认了NGC 1087的势能中存在非轴对称扰动。椭圆形畸变在CO中得到增强，这是由于其动力学上的冷性质。研究发现，所有相位（包括恒星、电离和分子）的动力学都可以同时由含有双轴对称扰动的模型描述，然而，沿着星体棒主轴的气体流入模型也很可能存在。此外，与分子质量流入率相关的可以解释星体棒中观察到的星形成率。这一结果进一步加强了星体棒是气体传输和触发星形成的机制的观点。这项工作利用迄今为止最先进的数据丰富了我们对星系非轴对称性的理解。<br /><br />总结: NGC 1087通过詹姆斯·韦伯空间望远镜观测到了非轴对称结构，形似星体棒，但有明显差异。非轴对称运动的空间延伸与星体棒重合，验证了NGC 1087的势能中存在非轴对称扰动。同时，CO中椭圆形畸变增强，而气体流入模型能很好地解释观测到的星形成率。这一研究加强了星体棒是气体传输和触发星形成的重要机制的观点。 <div>
We report a faint nonaxisymmetric structure in NGC 1087 through the use of James Webb Space Telescope Near Infrared Camera, with an associated kinematic counterpart observed as an oval distortion in the stellar velocity map, Hα, and CO J = 2 → 1 velocity fields. This structure is not evident in the MUSE optical continuum images but only revealed in the near-IR with the F200W and F300M band filters at 2 μm and 3 μm, respectively. Due to its elongation, this structure resembles a stellar bar although with remarkable differences with respect to conventional stellar bars. Most of the near-IR emission is concentrated within 6″∼500 pc with a maximum extension up to 1.2 kpc. The spatial extension of the large-scale noncircular motions is coincident with the bar, which undoubtedly confirms the presence of a nonaxisymmetric perturbation in the potential of NGC 1087. The oval distortion is enhanced in CO due to its dynamically cold nature rather than in Hα. We found that the kinematics in all phases, including stellar, ionized, and molecular, can be described simultaneously by a model containing a bisymmetric perturbation; however, we find that an inflow model of gas along the bar major axis is also likely. Furthermore, the molecular mass inflow rate associated can explain the observed star-formation rate in the bar. This reinforces the idea that bars are mechanisms for transporting gas and triggering star formation. This work contributes to our understanding of nonaxisymmetry in galaxies using the most sophisticated data so far.

总结:<br /><br />本文研究了Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi (DCF)方法在星云磁场评估中的应用。通过对一个理想云图应用五个DCF方程，确定了局部DCF估计的分布。发现统计校正因子βml表明BDCF是Bml的有偏估计，其值在0.7到0.9之间。此外，统计校正因子与MHD模拟得到的校正因子部分符合。作者估计了统计校正的相对重要性，并提出结构函数和原始DCF方程最为准确，需要的物理校正最少。而大角度和平行-δB方程的物理校正因子较大。这些结果有助于在模型限制下选择适用的DCF方程。 <div>
The Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi (DCF) method is widely used to evaluate magnetic fields in star-forming regions. Yet it remains unclear how well DCF equations estimate the mean plane-of-the-sky field strength in a map region. To address this question, five DCF equations are applied to an idealized cloud map. Its polarization angles have a normal distribution with dispersion σθ, and its density and velocity dispersion have negligible variation. Each DCF equation specifies a global field strength BDCF and a distribution of local DCF estimates. The “most-likely” DCF field strength Bml is the distribution mode, for which a correction factor βml ≡ Bml/BDCF is calculated analytically. For each equation, βml < 1, indicating that BDCF is a biased estimator of Bml. The values of βml are βml ≈ 0.7 when due to turbulent excitation of Alfvénic MHD waves, and βml ≈ 0.9 when due to non-Alfvénic MHD waves. These statistical correction factors βml have partial agreement with correction factors obtained from MHD simulations. The relative importance of the statistical correction is estimated by assuming that each simulation correction has both a statistical and a physical component. Then the standard, structure function, and original DCF equations appear most accurate because they require the least physical correction. Their relative physical correction factors are 0.1, 0.3, and 0.4 on a scale from 0 to 1. In contrast, the large-angle and parallel-δB equations have physical correction factors 0.6 and 0.7. These results may be useful in selecting DCF equations, within model limitations.

<br /><br />总结:
研究讨论了Type Ia超新星（SN Ia）在行星状星云（PN）内爆炸的可能性，通过对共同包层（CE）引发的恒星并合导致的SN Ia爆发进行了水动力学和非平衡电离模拟。研究比较了模拟的SNR的动力学和X射线光谱与银河系和麦哲伦云中已知Type Ia SNR的观测特征。研究发现CE事件和SN爆发之间的延迟对模拟结果产生了影响，CE事件后立即发生的SN爆发很难与观测一致，而延迟约10,000年的模型更接近观测结果，并可以解释一些Type Ia SNR的整体性质。 <div>
The nature of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) explosions remains an open issue, with several contending progenitor scenarios actively being considered. One such scenario involves an SN Ia explosion inside a planetary nebula (PN) in the aftermath of a stellar merger triggered by a common envelope (CE) episode. We examine this scenario using hydrodynamic and nonequilibrium ionization simulations of the interaction between the SN ejecta and the PN cocoon into the supernova remnant (SNR) phase, focusing on the impact of the delay between the CE episode and the SN explosion. We compare the bulk dynamics and X-ray spectra of our simulated SNRs to the observed properties of known Type Ia SNRs in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds. We conclude that models where the SN explosion happens in the immediate aftermath of the CE episode (with a delay ≲1000 yr) are hard to reconcile with the observations, because the interaction with the dense PN cocoon results in ionization timescales much higher than those found in any known Type Ia SNR. Models with a longer delay between the CE episode and the SN explosion (∼10,000 yr) are closer to the observations, and may be able to explain the bulk properties of some Type Ia SNRs.

We find an overall increase in the resulting star formation rate density (SFRD) compared to calibrations based on previous simulations (e.g., the PopIII SFRD is over an order of magnitude higher at z = 35−15). We evaluate the effect of the halo-to-halo scatter in this critical mass and find that it increases the PopIII stellar mass density by a factor ∼1.5 at z ≥ 15. Additionally, we assess the impact of various semianalytic/analytic prescriptions for halo assembly and star formation previously adopted in the literature. For example, we find that models assuming smooth halo growth computed via abundance matching predict SFRDs similar to the merger tree model for our fiducial model parameters, but that they may underestimate the PopIII SFRD in cases of strong LW feedback. Finally, we simulate subvolumes of the Universe with our model both to quantify the reduction in total star formation in numerical simulations due to a lack of density fluctuations on spatial scales larger than the simulation box, and to determine spatial fluctuations in SFRD due to the diversity in halo abundances and merger histories. <div>

For example, we find that models assuming smooth halo growth computed via abundance matching predict SFRDs similar to the merger tree model for our fiducial model parameters, but that they may underestimate the PopIII SFRD in cases of strong LW feedback. Finally, we simulate subvolumes of the Universe with our model both to quantify the reduction in total star formation in numerical simulations due to a lack of density fluctuations on spatial scales larger than the simulation box, and to determine spatial fluctuations in SFRD due to the diversity in halo abundances and merger histories.

该研究利用通用状态方程评估了中子星性质的拟全局关系的有效性，并确定了旋转和非旋转星之间的最大质量比。还揭示了新的表观扁率关系。这对新的双中子星合并事件的发现有影响，并有助于改进对旋转星表面X射线辐射的建模。 <div>
A considerable effort has been dedicated recently to the construction of generic equations of state (EOSs) for matter in neutron stars. The advantage of these approaches is that they can provide model-independent information on the interior structure and global properties of neutron stars. Making use of more than 106 generic EOSs, we assess the validity of quasi-universal relations of neutron-star properties for a broad range of rotation rates, from slow rotation up to the mass-shedding limit. In this way, we are able to determine with unprecedented accuracy the quasi-universal maximum-mass ratio between rotating and nonrotating stars and reveal the existence of a new relation for the surface oblateness, i.e., the ratio between the polar and equatorial proper radii. We discuss the impact that our findings have on the imminent detection of new binary neutron-star mergers and how they can be used to set new and more stringent limits on the maximum mass of nonrotating neutron stars, as well as to improve the modeling of the X-ray emission from the surface of rotating stars.

拟合光谱能量分布，星族形成速率，较高红移，尘埃衰减，恒星金属丰度。这项研究探讨了在缺乏红外数据的情况下，如何利用UV-光学-近红外光度学对z≳1的星形成速率进行强大的估计。他们发现，采用灵活的尘埃衰减定律和布鲁沃尔&查洛特模型的恒星族形成模型，固定太阳金属丰度以及最小化近1亿年内星族形成历史的变化，可以最大程度地提高红外和尘埃光度之间的一致性。最终，他们提供了一个使用最稳健模型得出的CANDELS星系参数目录，进一步完善了对z≳1星系的研究。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
Robust estimation of star formation rates (SFRs) at higher redshifts (z ≳ 1) using UV–optical–near-infrared (NIR) photometry is contingent on the ability of spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to constrain the dust attenuation, stellar metallicity, and star formation history (SFH) simultaneously. IR-derived dust luminosities can help break the degeneracy between these parameters, but IR data are often not available. Here, we explore strategies for SED fitting at z ≳ 1 in the absence of IR data using a sample of log M* > 10.2 star-forming galaxies from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) for which 24 μm data are available. We adopt the total IR luminosity (LTIR) obtained from 24 μm as the “ground truth,” which allows us to assess how well it can be recovered (as Ldust) from UV–optical–NIR SED fitting. We test a variety of dust attenuation models, stellar population synthesis models, metallicity assumptions, and SFHs separately to identify which assumptions maximize the agreement (correlation and linearity) between LTIR and Ldust. We find that a flexible dust attenuation law performs best. For stellar populations, we find that Bruzual & Charlot models are favored over those of Eldridge et al. Fixing the stellar metallicity at solar value is preferred to other fixed values or leaving it as a free parameter. For SFHs, we find that minimizing the variability in the recent (<100 Myr) SFH improves the agreement with LTIR. Finally, we provide a catalog of galaxy parameters (including M* and SFR) for CANDELS galaxies with and 0.7 < z < 1.3, obtained using the models we found to be the most robust.

<br /><br />
这篇文章研究了TNG300模拟中的虚空和虚空星系的特性。通过使用明亮星系目录和球形虚空发现算法，他们在红移z=0时识别了5078个虚空。这些虚空覆盖了模拟体积的83%，并且具有中位数半径为4.4 h−1 Mpc。作者基于星系是否存在于虚空内（“虚空星系”；75220个物体）或虚空外（“非虚空星系”；527454个物体），确定了两种星系群。在虚空内，质量不直接追踪光。虚空内的平均径向欠密度轮廓由虚空星系的位置定义，其系统性低于由暗物质定义的平均径向欠密度轮廓（即虚空更缺乏星系而非质量）。此外，与非虚空星系相比，虚空星系的平均年龄更小，质量更小，色彩更蓝，铁元素含量更低，半径更小。总体而言，虚空星系的特有恒星形成速率比非虚空星系高约20％，对于中心超大质量黑洞质量为MBH ≳ 3 × 106h−1 M⊙的星系，活跃虚空星系的比例比活跃的非虚空星系高约25％。

We investigate the properties of voids and void galaxies in the TNG300 simulation. Using a luminous galaxy catalog and a spherical void-finding algorithm, we identify 5078 voids at redshift z = 0. The voids cover 83% of the simulation volume and have a median radius of 4.4 h−1 Mpc. We identify two populations of field galaxies based on whether the galaxies reside within a void (“void galaxies”; 75,220 objects) or outside a void (“nonvoid galaxies”; 527,454 objects). Within the voids, mass does not directly trace light. Instead, the mean radial underdensity profile as defined by the locations of void galaxies is systematically lower than the mean radial underdensity profile as defined by the dark matter (i.e., the voids are more “devoid” of galaxies than they are of mass). Within the voids, the integrated underdensity profiles of the dark matter and the galaxies are independent of the local background density (i.e., voids-in-voids versus voids-in-clouds). Beyond the void radii, however, the integrated underdensity profiles of both the dark matter and the galaxies exhibit strong dependencies on the local background density. Compared to nonvoid galaxies, void galaxies are on average younger, less massive, bluer in color, less metal enriched, and have smaller radii. In addition, the specific star formation rates of void galaxies are ∼20% higher than nonvoid galaxies and, in the case of galaxies with central supermassive black holes with MBH ≳ 3 × 106h−1 M⊙, the fraction of active void galaxies is ∼25% higher than active nonvoid galaxies.

Using archival data from the 42-foot telescope at the Jodrell Bank Observatory, we produce daily stacks of aligned giant pulses for the Crab pulsar, to study changes to the daily profiles between 2012 April and 2016 December. From these, we identify echoes, where intervening material away from the line of sight causes pulsed emission to be redirected toward the observer, with delay corresponding to the increased distance of travel, resulting in additional profile components. These observations show that such echoes may be far more common than implied by the previous rate of detections. All the observed echoes are consistent with approaching zero delay at their closest approach to the normal giant pulse emission. This indicates that the structures responsible for producing these events must be highly anisotropic, with typical lengths greater than ∼4 au, typical widths on the sky of ∼0.1 au, and typical depths of ∼5 au, given the previously observed electron densities of the nebular filaments, on the order of 1000 cm−3. This suggests that these inhomogeneities are likely to be offshoot substructure from the larger nebular filaments of the Crab nebula.

总结: 
超新星质量的确定对于了解它们的形成、演化和内部结构至关重要。目前只有少数几十颗超新星的质量被测量过，大部分是属于双星系统。然而，有大量孤立的超新星的质量尚不清楚。利用超新星的微引力透镜现象提供了了解这些紪实体的独特机会。通过使用澳大利亚天文台的脉冲星目录和Gaia DR3，我们搜索和预测了这些最近和未来的事件。我们发现了60个可能由超新星引起的星空测量微引力透镜事件，并利用蒙特卡洛采样对它们的观测值进行了概率分布。我们还发现了四个可能的“定时微引力透镜”事件，即由前景物体引起的脉冲星微引力透镜现象，可能会通过定时测量被检测到。然而，我们对这些事件的预测受到可用星空测量和定时测量的不确定性的限制。 <div>
Determining the mass of neutron stars is crucial for understanding their formation, evolution, and interior structure. Currently, only a few dozen neutron stars have had their masses measured, and most of them belong to binary systems. However, there are a huge number of isolated neutron stars with unknown masses. Microlensing events with neutron stars provide unique opportunities for knowing these compact objects. Astrometric microlensing with a background source lensed by a neutron star might be used to determine the neutron star's mass by measuring the deviation of the motion of the centroid of the images from its unlensed one. We search and predict these recent and future events based on the Australia Telescope National Facility Pulsar Catalog and Gaia DR3. We find 60 candidate astrometric microlensing events caused by neutron stars and the probability distributions of their observables by the Monte Carlo sampling. We also find four candidate “timing microlensing” events with a pulsar lensed by a foreground object that might be detected by timing measurements. While some of these events may be verified by future astrometric missions or pulsar-timing observations, we note that our prediction of these events is significantly restricted by the uncertainties of the available astrometric and timing measurements after assessing and comparing our results with previous works.

<title>Life in a Random Universe: Sciama's Argument Reconsidered</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Random sampling in high dimensions has successfully been applied to phenomena as diverse as nuclear resonances, neural networks, and black hole evaporation. Here we revisit an elegant argument by the British physicist Dennis Sciama, who demonstrated that were our Universe random, it would almost certainly have a negligible chance for life. Under plausible assumptions, we show that a random universe can masquerade as “intelligently designed,” with the fundamental constants instead appearing to be fined tuned to achieve the highest probability for life to occur. For our Universe, this mechanism may only require there to be around a dozen currently unknown fundamental constants. We speculate on broader applications for the mechanism we uncover.

<title>Formation of PSR J1012+5307 with an Extremely Low-mass White Dwarf: Testing Magnetic Braking Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
PSR J1012+5307 is a millisecond pulsar with an extremely low-mass white dwarf (WD) companion in an orbit of 14.5 hr. Magnetic braking (MB) plays an important role in influencing the orbital evolution of binary systems with a low-mass (≲1–2 M⊙) donor star. At present, there exist several different MB descriptions. In this paper, we investigate the formation of PSR J1012+5307 as a probe to test plausible MB models. Employing a detailed stellar evolution model with the MESA code, we find that the convection- and rotation-boosted MB and “Intermediate” MB models can reproduce the WD mass, WD radius, WD surface gravity, neutron star mass, and orbital period observed in PSR J1012+5307. However, our simulated WD has a higher effective temperature than the observations. Three other MB mechanisms, including the standard MB model, are too weak to account for the observed orbital period in the Hubble time. A long cooling timescale caused by H-shell flashes of the WD may alleviate the discrepancy between the simulated effective temperature and the observed value.

<title>rms–Flux Slope in MAXI J1820+070: A Measure of Disk–Corona Coupling</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The linear rms–flux relation has been well established in different spectral states of all accreting systems. In this work, we study the evolution of the frequency-dependent rms–flux relation of MAXI J1820+070 during the initial decaying phase of its 2018 outburst with Insight-HXMT over a broad energy range of 1–150 keV. As the flux decreases, we first observe a linear rms–flux relation at frequencies from 2 mHz to 10 Hz, while such a relation breaks at varying times for different energies, leading to a substantial reduction in the slope. Moreover, we find that the low-frequency variability exhibits the highest sensitivity to the break, which occurs prior to the hard-to-hard state transition time determined through time-averaged spectroscopy, and the time deviation increases with energy. The overall evolution of the rms–flux slope and intercept suggests the presence of a two-component Comptonization system. One component is radially extended, explaining the strong disk–corona coupling before the break, while the other component extends vertically, contributing to a reduction of disk–corona coupling after the break. A further vertical expansion of the latter component is required to accommodate the dynamic evolution observed in the rms–flux slope. In conclusion, we suggest that the rms–flux slope in the 1–150 keV band can be employed as an indicator of disk–corona coupling, and the hard-to-hard state transition in MAXI J1820+070 could be partially driven by changes in the coronal geometry.

The Sun is one of the most luminous γ-ray sources in the sky and continues to challenge our understanding of its high-energy emission mechanisms. This study provides an in-depth investigation of the solar disk γ-ray emission, using data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope spanning 2008 August to 2022 January. We focus on γ-ray events with energies exceeding 5 GeV, originating from 0.°5 angular aperture centered on the Sun, and implement stringent time cuts to minimize potential sample contaminants. We use a helioprojection method to resolve the γ-ray events relative to the solar rotation axes and combine statistical tests to investigate the distribution of events over the solar disk. We found that integrating observations over large time windows may overlook relevant asymmetrical features, which we reveal in this work through a refined time-dependent morphological analysis. We describe significant anisotropic trends and confirm compelling evidence of energy-dependent asymmetry in the solar disk γ-ray emission. Intriguingly, the asymmetric signature coincides with the Sun’s polar field flip during the cycle 24 solar maximum, around 2014 June. Our findings suggest that the Sun’s magnetic configuration plays a significant role in shaping the resulting γ-ray signature, highlighting a potential link between the observed anisotropies, solar cycle, and the solar magnetic fields. These insights pose substantial challenges to established emission models, prompting fresh perspectives on high-energy solar astrophysics.

Using integral field spectroscopy (IFS) from MaNGA, we study the resolved microstructures in a shocked region in the Criss-cross Nebula (CCN), with an unprecedentedly high resolution of ≲1000 au. We measure surface brightness maps for 34 emission lines, which can be broadly divided into three categories: (1) the [O iii] λ5007-like group including seven high-ionization lines and two [O ii] auroral lines that uniformly present a remarkable lane structure, (2) the Hα λ6563-like group, including 23 low-ionization or recombination lines that present a clump-like structure, and (3) [O ii] λ3726 and [O ii] λ3729 showing high densities at both the [O iii] λ5007 lane and the Hα clump. We use these measurements to constrain resolved shock models implemented in MAPPINGS V. We find our data can be reasonably well fitted by a model that includes a plane-parallel shock with a velocity of 133 ± 5 km s −1, plus an isotropic two-dimensional Gaussian component, which is likely another clump of gas ionized by photons from the shocked region, and a constant background. We compare the electron density and temperature profiles as predicted by our model with those calculated using observed emission-line ratios. We find different line ratios to provide inconsistent temperature maps, and the discrepancies can be attributed to observational effects caused by limited spatial resolution and projection of the shock geometry, as well as contamination of the additional Gaussian component. Implications on shock properties and perspectives on future IFS-based studies of the CCN are discussed.

We present gas-phase elemental abundance ratios of thirteen local extremely metal-poor galaxies (EMPGs), including our new Keck/LRIS spectroscopy determinations together with 33 James Webb Space Telescope z ∼ 4–10 star-forming galaxies in the literature, and compare chemical evolution models. We develop chemical evolution models with the yields of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), Type Ia SNe, hypernovae (HNe), and pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), and compare the EMPGs and high-z galaxies in conjunction with dust depletion contributions. We find that high Fe/O values of EMPGs can (cannot) be explained by PISN metal enrichments (CCSN/HN enrichments even with the mixing-and-fallback mechanism enhancing iron abundance), while the observed Ar/O and S/O values are much smaller than the predictions of the PISN models. The abundance ratios of EMPGs can be explained by the combination of Type Ia SNe and CCSNe/HNe whose inner layers of argon and sulfur mostly fallback, which are comparable to the Sculptor stellar chemical abundance distribution, suggesting that early chemical enrichment has taken place in the EMPGs. Comparing our chemical evolution models with the star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 4–10, we find that the Ar/O and S/O ratios of the high-z galaxies are comparable to those of the CCSN/HN models, while the majority of high-z galaxies do not have constraints good enough to rule out contributions from PISNe. The high N/O ratio recently reported in GN-z11 cannot be explained even by rotating PISNe, but could be reproduced by the winds of rotating Wolf–Rayet stars that end up as a direct collapse.

The first Population III (Pop III) stars formed out of primordial, metal-free gas, in minihalos at z > 20, and kickstarted the cosmic processes of reionization and enrichment. While these stars are likely more massive than their enriched counterparts, the current unknowns of their astrophysics include when the first Pop III stars ignited, how massive they were, and when and how the era of the first stars ended. Investigating these questions requires an exploration of a multidimensional parameter space, including the slope of the Pop III stellar initial mass function (IMF) and the strength of the nonionizing UV background. In this work, we present a novel model which treats both the slope and maximum mass of Pop III stars as truly free parameters while including the physics of the fragmentation of primordial gas. Our results also hint at a nonuniversal Pop III IMF which is dependent on the efficiency of primordial gas fragmentation. Our relatively simple model reproduces the results from hydrodynamic simulations, but with a computational efficiency which allows us to investigate the observable differences between a wide range of potential Pop III IMFs. In addition, the evolution of the number density of Pop III stars may provide insight into the evolution of the H2 dissociating background. While the slope of the Pop III IMF does not significantly affect the predicted number density of the first stars, more top-heavy IMFs produce Pop III star clusters which are 2–3 magnitudes brighter than their more bottom-heavy counterparts. While the Pop III star clusters are too dim for direct detection by JWST, we find they are within the reach of gravitational lensing.

研究团队利用ALMA对Sagittarius B2的Deep South区域进行了观测，发现了九个新的热分子核。它们的温度结构复杂多样，峰值温度在252至662K之间，质量和半径也有着一定的范围。研究发现，这些热分子核与银河盘中的热核结构相似，但密度梯度较浅。此外，它们的CH3OH丰度随温度增加而增加，且和Sgr B2(N)有相似的性质，提示该区域可能是Sgr B2(N)和Sgr B2(M)的年轻、质量可比的对应物。研究还发现高温下CH3OH丰度的变化与化学模型的预测基本一致，但在更高温度下（T≳250K），观察到常数峰值丰度，这可能表明目前的模型尚未考虑到甲醇存留的机制。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究利用ALMA发现了Sagittarius B2的Deep South区域九个新的热分子核，这些核的性质与银河盘中的热核相似，同时也揭示了甲醇丰度与温度之间的关系，为热核的化学演化提供了新的观测证据。 <div>
We report the discovery of nine new hot molecular cores in the Deep South (DS) region of Sagittarius B2 using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 6 observations. We measure the rotational temperature of CH3OH and derive the physical conditions present within these cores and the hot core Sgr B2(S). The cores show heterogeneous temperature structure, with peak temperatures between 252 and 662 K. We find that the cores span a range of masses (203–4842 M⊙) and radii (3587–9436 au). CH3OH abundances consistently increase with temperature across the sample. Our measurements show the DS hot cores are structurally similar to Galactic disk hot cores, with radii and temperature gradients that are comparable to sources in the disk. They also show shallower density gradients than disk hot cores, which may arise from the Central Molecular Zone’s higher density threshold for star formation. The hot cores have properties which are consistent with those of Sgr B2(N), with three associated with Class II CH3OH masers and one associated with an ultra-compact H iiregion. Our sample nearly doubles the high-mass star-forming gas mass near Sgr B2(S) and suggests the region may be a younger, comparably massive counterpart to Sgr B2(N) and (M). The relationship between peak CH3OH abundance and rotational temperature traced by our sample and a selection of comparable hot cores is qualitatively consistent with predictions from chemical modeling. However, we observe constant peak abundances at higher temperatures (T ≳ 250 K), which may indicate mechanisms for methanol survival that are not yet accounted for in models.

总结:<br />该研究利用TESS的光度测光数据，通过机器学习方法识别系统性问题，并成功恢复了cool dwarfs恒星旋转周期。研究结果发现了旋转周期分布中的一些特殊结构，并通过光谱学和恒星进化模型估算了恒星质量和年龄。同时，研究还发现了旋转与恒星表面斑块填充分数之间的关联，为内部剪切机制产生这两种现象提供了支持。这些发现为恒星天体物理学和恒星演化研究提供了重要的信息。 <div>
The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission delivers time-series photometry for millions of stars across the sky, offering a probe into stellar astrophysics, including rotation, on a population scale. However, light-curve systematics related to the satellite’s 13.7 day orbit have prevented stellar rotation searches for periods longer than 13 days, putting the majority of stars beyond reach. Machine-learning methods have the ability to identify systematics and recover robust signals, enabling us to recover rotation periods up to 35 days for GK dwarfs and 80 days for M dwarfs. We present a catalog of 7245 rotation periods for cool dwarfs in the Southern Continuous Viewing Zone, estimated using convolutional neural networks. We find evidence for structure in the period distribution consistent with prior Kepler and K2 results, including a gap in 10–20 day cool-star periods thought to arise from a change in stellar spin-down or activity. Using a combination of spectroscopic and gyrochronologic constraints, we fit stellar evolution models to estimate masses and ages for stars with rotation periods. We find strong correlations between the detectability of rotation in TESS and the effective temperature, age, and metallicity of the stars. Finally, we investigate the relationships between rotation and newly obtained spot filling fractions estimated from Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment spectra. Field starspot filling fractions are elevated in the same temperature and period regime where open clusters’ magnetic braking stalls, lending support to an internal shear mechanism that can produce both phenomena.

<div> 关键词: 射电星系，FR-I，相对论流体动力学模拟，宇宙射线，能谱分布

总结:
本研究通过相对论流体动力学模拟重新现实了FR-I射流的流动动力学。研究发现，射流动力学的关键因素是射流脊柱流的平均洛伦兹因子〈Γ〉spine。此外，本研究还通过蒙特卡洛模拟跟踪了宇宙射线在模拟射流中的输运和能量化过程。宇宙射线主要通过扩散性激波加速（E ≲ 1 EeV）和剪切加速（E ≳ 1 EeV）获取能量，其能谱呈现双重幂律，在临界能量Ebreak处有指数截断。Ebreak受Hillas约束条件或通过快速空间扩散逃逸受到限制。本研究的模型能谱可用于研究射电星系对观测到的超高能宇宙射线的贡献。 <div>
Nearby radio galaxies (RGs) of Fanaroff–Riley Class I (FR-I) are considered possible sites for the production of observed ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). Among those, some exhibit blazar-like inner jets, while others display plume-like structures. We reproduce the flow dynamics of FR-I jets using relativistic hydrodynamic simulations. Subsequently, we track the transport and energization of cosmic ray (CR) particles within the simulated jet flows using Monte Carlo simulations. The key determinant of flow dynamics is the mean Lorentz factor of the jet-spine flow, 〈Γ〉spine. When 〈Γ〉spine ≳ 6, the jet spine remains almost unimpeded, but for 〈Γ〉spine ≲ 3, substantial jet deceleration occurs. CRs gain energy mainly through diffusive shock acceleration for E ≲ 1 EeV and shear acceleration for E ≳ 1 EeV. The time-asymptotic energy spectrum of CRs escaping from the jet can be modeled by a double power law, transitioning from ∼E−0.6 to ∼E−2.6 around a break energy, Ebreak, with an exponential cutoff at . Ebreak is limited either by the Hillas confinement condition or by particle escape from the cocoon via fast spatial diffusion. The spectral slopes primarily arise from multiple episodes of shock and relativistic shear acceleration, and the confinement–escape processes within the cocoon. The exponential cutoff is determined by nongradual shear acceleration that boosts the energy of high-energy CRs by a factor of . We suggest that the model spectrum derived in this work could be employed to investigate the contribution of RGs to the observed population of UHECRs.

<br />
这项研究探讨了太阳UV辐射的各向异性对日晕的影响。研究发现，UV辐射各向异性会导致日晕的极向/黄道比率发生变化，尤其在太阳极小期间的变化更为显著。此外，UV辐射各向异性还会增加来自下风方向的日晕强度。通过对SWAN卫星的观测数据进行对比分析，研究者得出了从1996年到2022年两个太阳活动周期期间太阳UV辐射各向异性的日变化情况。研究结果表明，在太阳极小期，太阳风的结构化程度较高，而UV辐射各向异性相对较小；而在太阳极大期，太阳风的各向同性增加，但UV辐射各向异性显著增强。 <div>
We present a study of the influence of solar UV anisotropy on the heliospheric backscatter helioglow generated by resonant scattering of solar Lyα photons on interstellar hydrogen atoms around the Sun. Simulations based on the WawHelioGlow model suggest that the response of the helioglow pole-to-ecliptic ratio to the anisotropy is linear, but 15% of the anisotropy (polar darkening) generates 30%–40% change in the ratio in the solar minimum and 15%–20% in the solar maximum. We attribute this difference to an interplay between the solar UV anisotropy and the latitudinal structure of the solar wind in solar minima. The solar UV anisotropy also increases the helioglow intensity from the downwind direction by 5%–10%, due to the influence of the anisotropy on the ionization losses and trajectories of atoms passing by the Sun in polar regions. Consequently, midlatitude regions (in the heliographic and ecliptic coordinates) are least affected by the UV anisotropy. By comparison of the simulation results with observations of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/SWAN satellite instrument, we derive the day-by-day time evolution of the solar Lyα anisotropy for the north and south poles over two solar cycles from 1996 to 2022. The inferred anisotropy is ∼5%–10% in solar minima and ∼15%–25% in solar maxima, the northern anisotropy being stronger than the southern one. Our study suggests that in solar minima a highly structured solar wind is associated with relatively small solar UV anisotropy, while in solar maxima the solar wind is more isotropic but a substantial solar UV anisotropy appears.

总结:
本文研究了潮汐激发的振荡现象，针对之前的作品中的HBSs进行了重新分析，并提出了检验其傅立叶谱中的谐波和非谐波振荡的分析流程。从21个HBSs中发现了12个具有显著的TEOs，并且发现轨道离心率与TEOs的谐波数之间存在正相关关系，而轨道周期与谐波数之间也存在正相关关系。此外，在赫罗图中发现了热星（表面有效温度T ≳ 6500 K）中TEOs更为显著的分布特征。这些结果为未来研究椭圆轨道中潮汐作用的HBSs提供了宝贵的目标。 <div>
Heartbeat stars (HBSs) with tidally excited oscillations (TEOs) are ideal laboratories for studying the effect of equilibrium and dynamical tides. However, studies of TEOs in Kepler HBSs are rare due to the need for better modeling of the equilibrium tide in light curves. We revisit the HBSs in our previous work and study the TEOs in these HBSs based on the derived orbital parameters that could express the equilibrium tide. We also compile a set of analytic procedures to examine the harmonic and anharmonic TEOs in their Fourier spectra. The TEOs of 21 HBSs have been newly analyzed and presented. Twelve of these HBSs show prominent TEOs (signal-to-noise ratio of the harmonics S/N ≥ 10). The relation between the orbital eccentricities and the harmonic number of the TEOs shows a positive correlation. The relation between the orbital periods and the harmonic number also shows a positive correlation. Furthermore, the distribution of HBSs with TEOs in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram shows that TEOs are more visible in hot stars with surface effective temperatures T ≳ 6500 K. These samples may also be valuable targets for future studies of the effect of tidal action in eccentric orbits.

<br /><br />总结:
最近的研究表明，各向异性对于解析宇宙射线的起源和传播具有重要价值。研究者建立了统一的场景来描述能谱和大尺度各向异性的观测，并注意到它们与能量的同步演变。本研究调查了局部正则磁场（LRMF）及其对各向异性扩散的影响。当垂直扩散系数远小于平行扩散系数时，偶极各向异性指向LRMF，并且可以复制100 TeV以下的观测相。此外，我们发现100 TeV以上的偶极相强烈依赖于局部扩散的演化。但目前该能量的测量仍然很少。我们建议可以进行更精确的100 TeV能量的测量，以揭示局部扩散和局部湍流。 <div>
Recent studies have shown that the anisotropy is of great value to decipher cosmic rays’ origin and propagation. We have built a unified scenario to describe the observations of the energy spectra and the large-scale anisotropy and called attention to their synchronous evolution with energy. In this work, the impact of the local regular magnetic field (LRMF) and corresponding anisotropic diffusion on large-scale anisotropy have been investigated. When the perpendicular diffusion coefficient is much smaller than the parallel one, the dipole anisotropy points to the LRMF and the observational phase below 100 TeV could be reproduced. Moreover, we find that the dipole phase above 100 TeV strongly depends on the evolution of local diffusion. But the current measurements at that energy are still scarce. We suggest that more precise measurements at that energy could be carried out to unveil the local diffusion and further the local turbulence.

总结:
通过数值模拟实验，成功模拟了磁流束的平衡位置随着背景磁场变化的准静态演化，以及由此引发的喷发过程。在喷发过程中，我们发现了从磁流束径向外传播的磁弹性波，并且追踪了它们的起源，揭示了它们是由磁流束内部扰动引起的。作为一个不完美的波导，磁流束允许内部扰动通过其表面逐渐泄漏到外部，引发了观测到的磁弹性波。此外，我们基于模拟数据合成了磁弹性波的图像，并发现与观测一致。这表明扰动从磁流束泄漏到外部可能是产生磁弹性波的合理机制。 <div>
We propose a mechanism for the excitation of large-scale quasiperiodic fast-propagating magnetoacoustic (QFP) waves observed on both sides of the coronal mass ejection. Through a series of numerical experiments, we successfully simulated the quasi-static evolution of the equilibrium locations of the magnetic flux rope in response to the change of the background magnetic field, as well as the consequent loss of the equilibrium that eventually gives rise to the eruption. During the eruption, we identified QFP waves propagating radially outward of the flux rope, and tracing their origin reveals that they result from the disturbance within the flux rope. Acting as an imperfect waveguide, the flux rope allows the internal disturbance to escape to the outside successively via its surface, invoking the observed QFP waves. Furthermore, we synthesized the images of QFP waves on the basis of the data given by our simulations and found consistency with observations. This indicates that the leakage of the disturbance outside the flux rope could be a reasonable mechanism for QFP waves.

We present a robust methodology for identifying photometric binaries in star clusters. Using Gaia DR3, Pan-STARRS, and Two Micron All Sky Survey data, we self-consistently define the cluster parameters and binary demographics for the open clusters (OCs) NGC 2168 (M35), NGC 7789, NGC 6819, NGC 2682 (M67), NGC 188, and NGC 6791. These clusters span in age from ∼200 Myr (NGC 2168) to more than ∼8 Gyr (NGC 6791) and have all been extensively studied in the literature. We use the Bayesian Analysis of Stellar Evolution software suite to derive the age, distance, reddening, metallicity, binary fraction, and binary mass-ratio posterior distributions for each cluster. We perform a careful analysis of our completeness and also compare our results to previous spectroscopic surveys. For our sample of main-sequence stars with masses between 0.6 and 1 M⊙, we find that these OCs have similar binary fractions that are also broadly consistent with the field multiplicity fraction. Within the clusters, the binary fraction increases dramatically toward the cluster centers, likely a result of mass segregation. Furthermore nearly all clusters show evidence of mass segregation within the single and binary populations. The OC binary fraction increases significantly with cluster age in our sample, possibly due to a combination of mass-segregation and cluster-dissolution processes. We also find a hint of an anticorrelation between binary fraction and cluster central density as well as total cluster mass, possibly due to an increasing frequency of higher-energy close stellar encounters that inhibit long-period binary survival and/or formation.

We demonstrate how to constrain the degree of absolute alignment of the total angular momenta of LIGO–Virgo binary black holes, looking for a special direction in space that would break isotropy. We also allow for inhomogeneities in the distribution of black holes over the sky. Making use of dipolar models for the spatial distribution and orientation of the sources, we analyze 57 signals with false-alarm rates ≤1 yr−1 from the third LIGO–Virgo observing run. Accounting for selection biases, we find the population of LIGO–Virgo black holes to be consistent with both homogeneity and isotropy. We additionally find the data to constrain some directions of alignment more than others, discuss the interpretation of this measurement, and produce posteriors for the directions of total angular momentum of all binaries in our set. While our current constraints are weak, the fact that such a small number of detections can already yield a measurement suggests that this will be a powerful tool in the future; we explore this prospect with a number of simulated catalogs of varying size. All code and data are made publicly available at https://github.com/maxisi/gwisotropy/.

We present the first detailed analysis of the ultra-steep spectrum radio halo in the merging galaxy cluster A521, based on upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio telescope observations. The combination of radio observations (300–850 MHz) and archival X-ray data provides a new window into the complex physics occurring in this system. When compared to all previous analyses, our sensitive radio images detected the centrally located radio halo emission to a greater extent of ∼1.3 Mpc. A faint extension of the southeastern radio relic has been discovered. We detected another relic, recently discovered by MeerKAT, and coincident with a possible shock front in the X-rays, at the northwest position of the center. We find that the integrated spectrum of the radio halo is well-fitted with a spectral index of −1.86 ± 0.12. A spatially resolved spectral index map revealed the spectral index fluctuations, as well as an outward radial steepening of the average spectral index. The radio and X-ray surface brightness is well correlated for the entire and different subparts of the halo, with sublinear correlation slopes (0.50–0.65). We also found a mild anticorrelation between the spectral index and X-ray surface brightness. Newly detected extensions of the SE relic and the counter relic are consistent with the merger in the plane of the sky.

总结: 本研究利用SPARK软件工具对GW170817双中子星合并事件的光谱进行分析，推测出了夜空中新合成的铀过程元素的丰度模式。在1.4天、2.4天和3.4天的光谱中，我们发现了不同的组分，其中在3.4天的光谱中出现了富含镧系元素的新成分。这表明在铀过程合成中存在多组分的情况，这对于理解宇宙中铀过程元素丰度的贡献具有重要意义。总体而言，这项研究对于理解kilonovae的形成和演化过程以及宇宙中铀过程元素的起源具有重要的启示。 <br /><br /> <div>
In kilonovae, freshly synthesized r-process elements imprint features on optical spectra, as observed in AT2017gfo, the counterpart to the GW170817 binary neutron star merger. However, measuring the r-process compositions of the merger ejecta is computationally challenging. Vieira et al. introduced Spectroscopic r-process Abundance Retrieval for Kilonovae (SPARK), a software tool to infer elemental abundance patterns of the ejecta and associate spectral features with particular species. Previously, we applied SPARK to the 1.4-day spectrum of AT2017gfo and inferred its abundance pattern for the first time, characterized by electron fraction Ye = 0.31, a substantial abundance of strontium, and a dearth of lanthanides and heavier elements. This ejecta is consistent with wind from a remnant hypermassive neutron star and/or accretion disk. We now extend our inference to spectra at 2.4 and 3.4 days and test the need for multicomponent ejecta, where we stratify the ejecta in composition. The ejecta at 1.4 and 2.4 days is described by the same single blue component. At 3.4 days, a new redder component with lower Ye = 0.16 and a significant abundance of lanthanides emerges. This new redder component is consistent with dynamical ejecta and/or neutron-rich ejecta from a magnetized accretion disk. As expected from photometric modeling, this component emerges as the ejecta expands, the photosphere recedes, and the earlier bluer component dims. At 3.4 days, we find an ensemble of lanthanides, with the presence of cerium most concrete. This presence of lanthanides has important implications for the contribution of kilonovae to the r-process abundances observed in the Universe.

The gas-phase reactions of methanimine (CH2NH) with small radicals, such as CN, CP, CCH, and OH, have been extensively studied theoretically in the literature, and the presence of a common, general reaction mechanism has been postulated. Since methanimine is considered the main precursor of complex imines in the interstellar medium (ISM), the present study extends the investigation of its reaction with other small radicals that have already been detected in the ISM. These are SiN, SH, NO, NS, HCO, HCS, and C3N. The corresponding products are easily formulated on the basis of the aforementioned general mechanism, and to understand whether they can be formed in the ISM, a preliminary thermochemical study has been carried out. The only exothermic addition reaction is that occurring between CH2NH and the C3N radical. This reaction has been further investigated in order to accurately characterize its reactive potential energy surface, which has then been employed in ab initio transition state theory calculations to derive global rate coefficients. The products of the CH2NH + C3N reaction are new potential interstellar species, namely, the Z and E isomers of HNCHCCCN and CH2NCCCN. For the first time, their structural characterization has been reported. In addition, this work investigates the possibility of H-abstraction processes for each radical species considered, and re-examines the CH2NH + CP reaction to derive the corresponding rate constants, that were still missing in the literature.

Magnetic fields of molecular clouds in the central molecular zone (CMZ) have been relatively under-observed at sub-parsec resolution. Here, we report JCMT/POL2 observations of polarized dust emission in the CMZ, which reveal magnetic field structures in dense gas at ∼0.5 pc resolution. The 11 molecular clouds in our sample include two in the western part of the CMZ (Sgr C and a farside cloud candidate), four around the Galactic longitude 0 (the 50 km s−1 cloud, CO 0.02−0.02, the Stone, and the Sticks andStraw among the Three Little Pigs), and five along the Dust Ridge (G0.253+0.016, clouds b, c, d, and e/f), for each of which we estimate the magnetic field strength using the angular dispersion function method. The morphologies of magnetic fields in the clouds suggest potential imprints of feedback from expanding H ii regions and young massive star clusters. A moderate correlation between the total viral parameter versus the star formation rate (SFR) and the dense gas fraction of the clouds is found. A weak correlation between the mass-to-flux ratio and the SFR, and a weak anticorrelation between the magnetic field and the dense gas fraction are also found. Comparisons between magnetic fields and other dynamic components in clouds suggest a more dominant role of self-gravity and turbulence in determining the dynamical states of the clouds and affecting star formation at the studied scales.

<div> 长期变异，短期变异，中红外数据，年轻恒星物体，驱动机制
<br />总结:
这篇文章分析了年轻恒星物体（YSOs）的亮度变异现象，探讨了长期和短期的变异情况，使用NEOWISE和YSOVAR两个中红外数据集进行观测。结果发现，短期变异检测率较高，而长期变异振幅通常是短期变异的3倍。此外，对1-2天的极短时间尺度也进行了变异评估。通过综合分析不同时间尺度上YSOs的变异情况，有助于更深入地理解其变异的潜在机制。 <div>
Variability in the brightness of young stellar objects (YSOs) is a common phenomenon that can be caused by changes in various factors, including accretion, extinction, disk morphology, interactions between the disk and the stellar photosphere, and the rotation of hot or cold magnetic spots on the stellar photosphere. Analyzing the variability on different timescales provides insight into the mechanisms driving the changes in the brightness of YSOs. We investigate the variability of YSOs on both long and short timescales using two mid-IR data sets: the Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE) 7.5 yr W2 (4.6 μm) data and the YSOVAR 40 day Spitzer/IRAC2 (4.5 μm) data, respectively. We classify the variability types in each timescale following Park et al. We find a higher detection rate of variable sources in the short term (77.6%) compared to the long term (43.0%) due to the higher sensitivity of the Spitzer observations. In addition, the higher cadence of the YSOVAR data results in the weeks-long short-term variability being mostly secular, while the years-long long-term variability explored with the coarsely sampled NEOWISE data is mostly stochastic. By crossmatching the two catalogs, we statistically analyze the variability types exhibited by YSOs across both timescales. The long-term variability amplitude is mostly three times (up to 10 times) greater than the short-term variability. Furthermore, we evaluate variability on very short (1–2 days) timescales and recover a trend of the increasing amplitude of variability as the timescales increase. By comprehensively analyzing the variability of YSOs over various timescales, we contribute to a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving their variability.

<title>Scale and Time Dependence of Alfvénicity in the Solar Wind as Observed by the Parker Solar Probe</title>

<div> 关键词: Alfvénicity, Parker Solar Probe, 太阳风, 磁场, 速度波动
总结:
Alfvénicity是太阳风中常见的一种特性，通过Parker Solar Probe的数据可以更接近太阳研究这一特性。通过时间滞后的磁场和速度增量的二阶函数来研究Alfvénicity。发现Alfvénicity与时间滞后具有尺度相关的特性，并且随着距离太阳更近而增加。大部分时间太阳风具有高Alfvénicity，但在接近赤道面或其他磁场结构变化明显的地方观察到较低的Alfvénicity。这些结果表明，太阳表面附近产生的Alfvénic波动向外传播，在年轻的太阳风中形成高度Alfvénic的状态，而与大尺度结构和梯度的相互作用导致较弱的Alfvénicity，这是常见于更大的太阳离心距离上的现象。 <div>
Alfvénicity is a well-known property, common in the solar wind, characterized by a high correlation between magnetic and velocity fluctuations. Data from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) enable the study of this property closer to the Sun than ever before, as well as in the sub-Alfvénic solar wind. We consider scale-dependent measures of Alfvénicity based on second-order functions of the magnetic and velocity increments as a function of time lag, including the normalized cross helicity σc and residual energy σr. Scale-dependent Alfvénicity is strongest for lags near the correlation scale and increases when moving closer to the Sun. We find that σr typically remains close to the maximally negative value compatible with σc. We did not observe significant changes in measures of Alfvénicity between sub-Alfvénic and super-Alfvénic wind. During most times, the solar wind was highly Alfvénic; however, lower Alfvénicity was observed when PSP approached the heliospheric current sheet or other magnetic structures with sudden changes in the radial magnetic field, non-unidirectional strahl electron pitch angle distributions, and strong electron density contrasts. These results are consistent with a picture in which Alfvénic fluctuations generated near the photosphere transport outward, forming highly Alfvénic states in the young solar wind, and subsequent interactions with large-scale structures and gradients lead to weaker Alfvénicity, as commonly observed at larger heliocentric distances.

总结: 
ODIN是一个使用DECam进行观测的天文调查项目，旨在通过窄带滤光片获取深度图像，以探测特定红移的Lyα辐射星系。主要科学目标包括测量LAE、LABs和原星团的聚集强度和暗物质晕的关联，以及它们与宇宙网中的丝状结构的关系。此外，ODIN还将进行其他的辅助科学研究，包括对较低红移的发射线星系样本的类似研究和对附近的星形成星系进行调查。此外，ODIN还将在宇宙中午期间探测红移演化。通过这些研究，我们将能够更好地了解宇宙中午时期的星系形成和演化过程。 <br /><br /> <div>
We describe the survey design and science goals for One-hundred-deg2 DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN), a NOIRLab survey using the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) to obtain deep (AB ∼ 25.7) narrowband images over an unprecedented area of sky. The three custom-built narrowband filters, N419, N501, and N673, have central wavelengths of 419, 501, and 673 nm and respective FWHM of 7.5, 7.6, and 10.0 nm, corresponding to Lyα at z = 2.4, 3.1, and 4.5 and cosmic times of 2.8, 2.1, and 1.4 Gyr, respectively. When combined with even deeper, public broadband data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam, DECam, and in the future, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, the ODIN narrowband images will enable the selection of over 100,000 Lyα-emitting (LAE) galaxies at these epochs. ODIN-selected LAEs will identify protoclusters as galaxy overdensities, and the deep narrowband images enable detection of highly extended Lyα blobs (LABs). Primary science goals include measuring the clustering strength and dark matter halo connection of LAEs, LABs, and protoclusters, and their respective relationship to filaments in the cosmic web. The three epochs allow for the redshift evolution of these properties to be determined during the period known as Cosmic Noon, where star formation was at its peak. The narrowband filter wavelengths are designed to enable interloper rejection and further scientific studies by revealing [O ii] and [O iii] at z = 0.34, Lyα and He ii 1640 at z = 3.1, and Lyman continuum plus Lyα at z = 4.5. Ancillary science includes similar studies of the lower-redshift emission-line galaxy samples and investigations of nearby star-forming galaxies resolved into numerous [O iii] and [S ii] emitting regions.

<div> 快速射电暴（FRB）、观测结果、等待时间分布、磁层传播效应、吸收概率

总结：<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了快速射电暴领域进入精细表征时代，观测结果丰富。发现重复性FRB的等待时间分布呈现出左峰低于右峰的双峰特征，认为这种不对称形状是由磁层中的传播效应引起的。文章详细解释了快速射电暴穿过磁化等离子体时诱发的效应，包括电荷粒子的圆周运动形成电流环，进而引起与背景磁场相反方向的感应磁场，从而影响后续快速射电暴的散射吸收概率，以及对爆发光度的影响。 <div>
The field of fast radio bursts (FRBs) has entered the age of fine characterization as observational results from different radio telescopes become more and more abundant. The large FRB sample is suitable for a statistical study. There is an interesting finding that the waiting-time distributions of very active repeating FRBs show a universal double-peaked feature, with left peaks lower than right ones. Assuming these two peaks are independent and initially comparable, we show that the observed asymmetric shape can be ascribed to the propagational effect in the magnetosphere. An FRB passing through the magnetized plasma will induce the circular motion of charged particles to form a current loop. This further leads to an induced magnetic field in the opposite direction with respect to the background field. As the effective field strength changes, the scattering absorption probability of the following FRB will be influenced. The absorption can be important under certain physical conditions and bursts with smaller time lags are easier to be absorbed. Also, there will be an imprint on the flux distribution as the scattering optical depth depends on burst luminosity as well.

X-ray binary systems consist of a companion star and a compact object in close orbit. Thanks to their copious X-ray emission, these objects have been studied in detail using X-ray spectroscopy and timing. The inclination of these systems is a major uncertainty in the determination of the mass of the compact object using optical spectroscopic methods. In this paper, we present a new method to constrain the inclination of X-ray binaries, which is based on the modeling of the polarization of X-rays photons produced by a compact source and scattered off the companion star. We describe our method and explore the potential of this technique in the specific case of the low-mass X-ray binary GS 1826−238 observed by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer observatory.

Both observational evidence and theoretical considerations from magnetohydrodynamic simulations of jets suggest that the relativistic jets of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are radially stratified, with a fast inner spine surrounded by a slower-moving outer sheath. The resulting relativistic shear layers are a prime candidate for the site of relativistic particle acceleration in the jets of AGNs and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In this article, we present outcomes of particle-in-cell simulations of magnetic-field generation and particle acceleration in the relativistic shear boundary layers (SBLs) of jets in AGNs and GRBs. We investigate the effects of inverse Compton cooling on relativistic particles that are accelerated in the SBLs of relativistic jets, including the self-consistent calculation of the radiation spectrum produced by inverse Compton scattering of relativistic electrons in an isotropic external soft photon field. We find that the Compton cooling can be substantial, depending on the characteristic energy (blackbody temperature and energy density) of the external radiation field. The produced Compton emission is highly anisotropic and more strongly beamed along the jet direction than the characteristic 1/Γ pattern expected from intrinsically isotropic emission in the comoving frame of an emission region moving along the jet with a bulk Lorentz factor Γ. We suggest that this may resolve the long-standing problem of the Doppler factor crisis.

JWST发布了第一张科学图像，显示了遥远背景中SMACS J0723.3-7327星系团的许多星系。一些人声称红移高达z ≃ 20，挑战了标准的宇宙结构形成模型。研究人员基于5个经光谱确认的系统以及12个预测成像对应物的系统，建立了SMACS J0723.3-7327的透镜模型。他们利用这一模型成功地复现了所有这些成像对应物的位置、形态和相对亮度，并且根据几何测量得出了12个候选多次成像星系的红移范围。研究人员还根据这一透镜模型创建了透镜发现者地图，用于预测具有特定红移的星系被预测为多次成像。通过将这一地图应用到声称在10 ≲ z ≲ 20的三个星系上，研究人员发现没有在预计位置上发现被放大到足以被检测到的成像对应物，这表明这些星系可能位于z ≲ 1.7–3.2。因此，迫切需要为星系团的领域创建可靠的透镜发现者地图，以测试和约束从JWST发现的候选高红移星系的光度推断的红移。 <div>
The first science image released by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveals numerous galaxies in the distant background of the galaxy cluster SMACS J0723.3-7327. Some have claimed redshifts of up to z ≃ 20, challenging standard cosmological models for structure formation. Here, we present a lens model for SMACS J0723.3-7327 anchored on five spectroscopically confirmed systems at 1.38 ≤ z ≤ 2.21 that are multiply lensed, along with 12 other systems with proposed image counterparts sharing common colors, spectral energy distributions, and morphological features, but having unknown redshifts. Constrained only by their image positions, and where available, redshifts, our lens model correctly reproduces the positions and correctly predicts the morphologies and relative brightnesses of all these image counterparts, as well as providing geometrically determined redshifts spanning 1.4 ≲ z ≲ 6.7 for the 12 candidate multiply lensed galaxies lacking spectroscopic measurements. From this lens model, we create a lens finder map that defines regions over which galaxies beyond a certain redshift are predicted to be multiply lensed. Applying this map to three galaxies claimed to be at 10 ≲ z ≲ 20, we find no image counterparts at locations (with an uncertainty of ∼0.″5) where they ought to be sufficiently magnified to be detectable—suggesting instead that these galaxies lie at z ≲ 1.7–3.2. In lieu of spectroscopy, the creation of reliable lens finder maps for cluster fields is urgently needed to test and constrain redshifts inferred from photometry for a rapidly increasing number of candidate high-z galaxies found with JWST.

We analyze the circumgalactic medium (CGM) for eight commonly-used cosmological codes in the AGORA collaboration. The codes are calibrated to use identical initial conditions, cosmology, heating and cooling, and star formation thresholds, but each evolves with its own unique code architecture and stellar feedback implementation. Here, we analyze the results of these simulations in terms of the structure, composition, and phase dynamics of the CGM. We show properties such as metal distribution, ionization levels, and kinematics are effective tracers of the effects of the different code feedback and implementation methods, and as such they can be highly divergent between simulations. This is merely a fiducial set of models, against which we will in the future compare multiple feedback recipes for each code. Nevertheless, we find that the large parameter space these simulations establish can help disentangle the different variables that affect observable quantities in the CGM, e.g., showing that abundances for ions with higher ionization energy are more strongly determined by the simulation’s metallicity, while abundances for ions with lower ionization energy are more strongly determined by the gas density and temperature.

利用ALMA波段6的观测发现了与HH 30相关的原恒星系统的分子线发射情况。其中13CO分子线显示出了吸积盘，而12CO分子线的发射则追溯到分子流。我们估计了中心物体的动力质量为0.45 ± 0.14 M⊙，分子流的质量为(1.83 ± 0.19) × 10−4M⊙。分子流具有内部腔体以及多个外流壳结构。我们辨别出了三个不同的具有恒定膨胀速度 (∼4–6 km s−1) 和可能有旋转签名（≤0.5 km s−1）的壳层。我们发现这些壳层可以通过磁离心盘风来解释，具有发射半径 Rlaunch ≲ 4 au 和较小的磁力臂 λ ∼ 1.6–1.9。多壳结构可能是由于来自与三个不同时期相关的吸积盘的物质的周期性喷射而产生的，这三个时期的动力学年龄分别为 497 ± 15 yr，310 ± 9 yr 和 262 ± 11 yr。最外层的壳层是在中间壳层之前 187 ± 17 yr 喷射的，而中间壳层是在最内层壳层之前 48 ± 14 yr 喷射的。我们对流和吸积流量的线性和角动量率的估算与预期值一致，表明HH 30的流是由宽角盘风产生的。<br /><br />总结: 本研究利用ALMA波段6对HH30的原恒星系统进行了观测，发现13CO分子线显示出吸积盘，而12CO分子线显示出分子流。对中心物体的质量和分子流的质量进行了估算，发现分子流具有内部腔体以及多个外流壳结构。分别辨识出了三个壳层，并解释这些壳层可能是由于周期性的来自吸积盘的物质喷射而产生。最后，对流和吸积流量的线性和角动量率的估算与预期值一致，表明HH 30的流是由宽角盘风产生的。 <div>
We present archival Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array band 6 observations of the 13CO (J = 2–1) and 12CO (J = 2–1) molecular line emission of the protostellar system associated with HH 30. The 13CO molecular line shows the accretion disk while the molecular outflow is traced by the emission of the 12CO molecular line. We estimated a dynamical mass for the central object of 0.45 ± 0.14 M⊙, and a mass for the molecular outflow of (1.83 ± 0.19) × 10−4M⊙. The molecular outflow presents an internal cavity as well as multiple outflowing shell structures. We distinguish three different shells with constant expansion (∼4–6 km s−1) and possible rotation signatures (≤0.5 km s−1). We find that the shells can be explained by magnetocentrifugal disk winds with launching radii Rlaunch ≲ 4 au and a small magnetic lever arm λ ∼ 1.6–1.9. The multiple shell structure may be the result of episodic ejections of the material from the accretion disk associated with three different epochs with dynamical ages of 497 ± 15 yr, 310 ± 9 yr, and 262 ± 11 yr for the first, second, and third shells, respectively. The outermost shell was ejected 187 ± 17 yr before the middle shell, while the middle shell was launched 48 ± 14 yr before the innermost shell. Our estimations of the linear and angular momentum rates of the outflow as well as the accretion luminosity are consistent with the values expected if the outflow of HH 30 is produced by a wide-angle disk wind.

Stellar counterrotation in disk galaxies directly relates to the complex phenomenon of the disk mass assembly believed to be driven by external processes, such as accretion and mergers. The study of such systems makes it possible to reveal the source of external accretion and establish the details of this process. In this paper, we investigate the galaxy PGC 66551 (MaNGA ID 1-179561), which hosts two large-scale counterrotating (CR) stellar disks identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey MaNGA data and then confirmed using deep follow-up spectroscopy with the 10 m Southern African Large Telescope. We measured the properties of ionized gas and stellar populations of both CR disks in PGC 66551. We found that the CR disk is compact, contains young stars with subsolar metallicity, and has a stellar mass of 5 × 109M⊙, which amounts to ≈20% of the galaxy’s total. Surprisingly, the main 8 Gyr old disk has a significantly lower metallicity of −0.8 dex than other CR galaxies. We developed a simple analytic model of the history of the metal enrichment, which we applied to PGC 66551 and constrained the parameters of the galactic outflow wind, and estimated the metallicity of the infalling gas that formed the CR disk to be −0.9... −0.5 dex. Our interpretation prefers a merger with a gas-rich satellite over cold accretion from a cosmic filament as a source of gas, which then formed the CR disk in PGC 66551.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究对263个在COSMOS领域发现的射电选择的NIR-dark（RS-NIRdark）星系进行了全光谱的研究。这些星系被选择为射电亮星系（S3 GHz > 12.65 μJy），但在NIR-selected COSMOS2020目录中没有对应物体（Ks ≳ 25.5 mag）。通过构建新的光度测量目录和使用两种不同的代码进行光谱能量分布拟合程序，估计了这些星系的光红移和物理特性。结果表明，这些星系的消光中值很高（Av ∼ 4），星团形成速率也很高（SFR ∼ 500 M⊙ yr−1），符合可能是DSFG的特性。另外，星系的光红移中值很大（z ∼ 3），并且存在一定比例的高红移候选者（z > 4.5），这表明这些星系对宇宙SFRD和高红移星系的演化路径具有重要贡献。 <div>
In the last decades, an increasing scientific interest has been growing in the elusive population of dark (i.e., lacking an optical/near-IR, hereafter NIR, counterpart) dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). Although extremely promising for their likely contribution to the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) and for their possible role in the evolution of the first massive and passive galaxies around z ∼ 3, the difficulty in selecting statistically significant samples of dark DSFGs is limiting their scientific potentialities. This work presents the first panchromatic study of a sample of 263 radio-selected NIR-dark (RS-NIRdark) galaxies discovered in the COSMOS field following the procedure by Talia et al. These sources are selected as radio-bright galaxies (S3 GHz > 12.65 μJy) with no counterpart in the NIR-selected COSMOS2020 catalog (Ks ≳ 25.5 mag). For these sources, we build a new photometric catalog including accurate photometry from the optical to the radio obtained with a new deblending pipeline (Photometry Extractor for Blended Objects, or PhoEBO). We employ this catalog to estimate the photo-zs and the physical properties of the galaxies through an spectral energy distribution-fitting procedure performed with two different codes (Magphys and Cigale). Finally, we estimate the active galactic nucleus contamination in our sample by performing a series of complementary tests. The high values of the median extinction (Av ∼ 4) and star formation rate (SFR ∼ 500 M⊙ yr−1) confirm the likely DSFG nature of the RS-NIRdark galaxies. The median photo-z (z ∼ 3) and the presence of a significant tail of high-z candidates (z > 4.5) suggest that these sources are important contributors to the cosmic SFRD and the evolutionary path of galaxies at high redshifts.

<br /><br />总结:
太阳周期23和24的数据驱动3D平均场动力模型研究了环形磁通量预算。该模型模拟了全球太阳动力机制，包括太阳表面出现和演化的双极磁区（BMRs）的影响。通过应用斯托克斯定理到动力感应方程，我们展示了在对流层深处的轴对称环形磁场生成率的半球幅值只能部分地从差分旋转和轴对称径向磁场的表面参数估计。沿赤道的径向积分的贡献主要是由对流层底部的转动径向剪切引起的，并且与表面纬向差分旋转的影响几乎同样大小且几乎同相。此外，环形场生成率估计强烈依赖于表面极地附近的径向磁场纬向剖面。在我们的动力模型中，这种剖面明显偏离了观察到的太阳周期22、23和24极小值期间的极地磁场分布。这种差异的原因需要进一步的观测和理论研究。通过比较2D轴对称和3D非轴对称动力模型，我们发现由于BMRs的表面影响，3D模型中环形场生成率增加，导致轴对称磁场的幅值增加。 <div>
We study the toroidal magnetic flux budget of the axisymmetric part of a data-driven 3D mean-field dynamo model of Solar Cycles 23 and 24. The model simulates the global solar dynamo that includes the effects of the formation and evolution of bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs) emerging on the solar surface. By applying Stokes’s theorem to the dynamo induction equation, we show that the hemispheric magnitude of the net axisymmetric toroidal magnetic field generation rate in the bulk of the convection zone can only partially be estimated from the surface parameters of the differential rotation and the axisymmetric radial magnetic field. The contribution of the radial integral along the equator, which is mostly due to the rotational radial shear at the bottom of the convection zone, has the same magnitude and is nearly in phase with the effect of the surface latitudinal differential rotation. Also, the toroidal field generation rate estimate strongly depends on the latitudinal profile of the surface radial magnetic field near the poles. This profile in our dynamo models significantly deviates from the polar magnetic field distribution observed during the minima of Solar Cycles 22, 23, and 24. The cause of this discrepancy requires further observational and theoretical studies. Comparing the 2D axisymmetric and the 3D nonaxisymmetric dynamo models, we find an increase in the toroidal field generation rate in the 3D model due to the surface effects of BMRs, resulting in an increase in the axisymmetric poloidal magnetic field magnitude.

<br /><br />总结:
这篇文章报道了对16个星系的[O III] λ4364电子发射线的探测结果，这些星系的红移在z=2.1-8.7。文章将这些结果与文献中的9个z=4-9星系的检测结果以及21个z=1.4-3.7星系的地面光谱检测结果进行了合并，并为这些星系得到了电子温度(Te)和直接方法氧丰度的数值。这篇文章构建了第一个基于电子温度的高红移金属丰度校准，可适用于z=2-9的星系样本，提高了宇宙中午时期和再电离纪元金属丰度测定的准确性。这些新的高红移校准改进了我们对早期宇宙中反馈和重子循环的理解。JWST/NIRSpec的深度光谱项目有望提高当前样本覆盖的金属丰度范围的低端和高端的数据统计水平，并提高[N II] λ6585的检测率，从而使未来对基于氮的指标的评估成为可能。 <div>
We report detections of the [O iii]λ4364 auroral emission line for 16 galaxies at z = 2.1–8.7, measured from JWST/NIRSpec observations obtained as part of the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey program. We combine this CEERS sample with 9 objects from the literature at z = 4−9 with auroral-line detections from JWST/NIRSpec and 21 galaxies at z = 1.4−3.7 with auroral-line detections from ground-based spectroscopy. We derive electron temperature (Te) and direct-method oxygen abundances for the combined sample of 46 star-forming galaxies at z = 1.4−8.7. We use these measurements to construct the first high-redshift empirical Te-based metallicity calibrations for the strong-line ratios [O iii]/Hβ, [O ii]/Hβ, R23 = ([O iii]+[O ii])/Hβ, [O iii]/[O ii], and [Ne iii]/[O ii]. These new calibrations are valid over 12+log(O/H) = 7.4−8.3 and can be applied to samples of star-forming galaxies at z = 2−9, leading to an improvement in the accuracy of metallicity determinations at Cosmic Noon and in the Epoch of Reionization. The high-redshift strong-line relations are offset from calibrations based on typical z ∼ 0 galaxies or H ii regions, reflecting the known evolution of ionization conditions between z ∼ 0 and z ∼ 2. Deep spectroscopic programs with JWST/NIRSpec promise to improve statistics at the low and high ends of the metallicity range covered by the current sample, as well as to improve the detection rate of [N ii]λ6585 and thus allow the future assessment of N-based indicators. These new high-redshift calibrations will enable accurate characterizations of metallicity scaling relations at high redshift, improving our understanding of feedback and baryon cycling in the early Universe.

总结:
本文对Fermi-4LAC明亮的平谱射电类星体（FSRQs）进行为期14年的长期多波段研究，通过Fermi大面积望远镜、斯威夫特X射线望远镜和紫外/光学望远镜获取的伽马射线、X射线和紫外/光学数据的详细变化和光谱分析，揭示了不同活动状态下的变化。通过提出一种新的方法来约束模型参数，有效地重现了样本的多波段同时/准同时谱能分布（SEDs），并估计了样本的射流辐射区参数值。还利用同步辐射自身康普顿和外部康普顿过程，采用对数抛物线谱形来近似样本源的观测谱，考虑到引起的物理参数。模型结果表明：（1）通过有效地再现明亮FSRQs不同活跃状态的SEDs，合理地约束了辐射区内的参数；（2）与其他活跃状态相比，喷流的辐射区在高状态下呈现较小的半径，而在低状态下磁场强度增加；（3）对于处于高活跃状态的明亮FSRQs，多普勒因子增强，通常呈现出能量均分的趋势。 <div>
In this paper, we present a long-term multiwavelength investigation focusing on 12 distinct samples of Fermi-4LAC bright flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). Detailed variability and spectral analyses of γ-ray, X-ray, and ultraviolet/optical data obtained by the Fermi Large Area Telescope, the Swift X-ray Telescope, and the Swift Ultraviolet and Optical Telescope were performed over a period of about 14 yr, spanning from 2008 October to 2022 October. These analyses provide insights into characterizing the variations within different activity states. To efficiently reproduce the multiwavelength simultaneous/quasi-simultaneous spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the samples, we propose a novel approach for constraining the model parameters. By analyzing the parameters of the energy spectral curvature (β), the peak frequency (νpk), the peak luminosity (Lpk), the Compton dominance parameter (AC), and the variability timescale (tvar) in different activity states, we can estimate the values of the jet radiation region parameters for the samples. Subsequently, we utilize the synchrotron-self-Compton and external Compton processes, employing a logarithmic-parabolic spectral shape to approximate the observed spectra of the sample sources, while considering the induced regime for the physical parameters. The model results show that: (1) by effectively reproducing SEDs in various active states of bright FSRQs, the parameters within the emission region were reasonably constrained; (2) compared to other active states, the emission region of the jet exhibits a reduced radius during the high state, while the magnetic field strength increases during the low state; and (3) for bright FSRQs in a high-activity state, there is an enhancement of the Doppler factor, often exhibiting a tendency toward energy equipartition.

<br />总结:<br />本文指出来自脉冲星和黑洞的相对论性风的等离子体注入效应的主导重要性。在光线圆之外，沿着螺旋磁场滑动的磁场占优势的流动几乎呈径向移动，具有很大的洛伦兹因子，γ0≫1，在间隙内成对产生时，这些因子被印记到流动中。只有在更大的距离r≥γ0(c/Ω)时，MHD加速度Γ∝r才会接管。因此，Blandford-Znajek(BZ)驱动的流动产生了脊柱明亮的图像。M87中最清晰的喷流显示出边缘明亮的特征，以及较弱的脊柱明亮特征。只有脊柱明亮的成分可以由BZ驱动/起源于黑洞的磁层。 <div>
We point out the dominant importance of plasma injection effects of relativistic winds from pulsars and black holes. We demonstrate that outside the light cylinder, the magnetically dominated outflows sliding along the helical magnetic field move nearly radially with very large Lorentz factors, γ0 ≫ 1, imprinted into the flow during pair production within the gaps. Only at larger distances, r ≥ γ0(c/Ω), does MHD acceleration Γ ∝ r take over. As a result, Blandford–Znajek (BZ)-driven outflows produce spine-brightened images. The best-resolved case of the jet in M87 shows both edge-brightened features, as well as weaker spine-brightened features. Only the spine-brightened component can be BZ driven/originate from the black hole's magnetosphere.

<div> 高频紫外到近红外观测，Type Ia 超新星，SN 2023bee，光谱，理论模型，早期过量流量

总结:
观测了超新星SN 2023bee，发现在爆炸后的最初几天有过量流量，特别是在高频观测中。该超新星的过量流量在紫外波段较红，并且较不明亮。光谱显示了较弱的吸收线，但目前的理论模型无法完全解释观测到的现象。可能是由于潜在的不对称发射造成的，这种过量流量的物理原因可能在正常的Type Ia 超新星中普遍存在。 <div>
We present high-cadence ultraviolet through near-infrared observations of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2023bee at D = 32 ± 3 Mpc, finding excess flux in the first days after explosion, particularly in our 10 minutes cadence TESS light curve and Swift UV data. Compared to a few other normal SNe Ia with early excess flux, the excess flux in SN 2023bee is redder in the UV and less luminous. We present optical spectra of SN 2023bee, including two spectra during the period where the flux excess is dominant. At this time, the spectra are similar to those of other SNe Ia but with weaker Si ii, C ii, and Ca ii absorption lines, perhaps because the excess flux creates a stronger continuum. We compare the data to several theoretical models on the origin of early excess flux in SNe Ia. Interaction with either the companion star or close-in circumstellar material is expected to produce a faster evolution than observed. Radioactive material in the outer layers of the ejecta, either from double detonation explosion or from a 56Ni clump near the surface, cannot fully reproduce the evolution either, likely due to the sensitivity of early UV observable to the treatment of the outer part of ejecta in simulation. We conclude that no current model can adequately explain the full set of observations. We find that a relatively large fraction of nearby, bright SNe Ia with high-cadence observations have some amount of excess flux within a few days of explosion. Considering potential asymmetric emission, the physical cause of this excess flux may be ubiquitous in normal SNe Ia.

Many theories of dark matter beyond the weakly interacting massive particles paradigm feature an enhanced matter power spectrum on subparsec scales, leading to the formation of dense dark matter minihalos. Future local observations are promising to search for and constrain such substructures. The survival probability of these dense minihalos in the Milky Way environment is crucial for interpreting local observations. In this work, we investigate two environmental effects: stellar disruption and (smooth) tidal disruption. These two mechanisms are studied using semianalytic models and idealized N-body simulations. For stellar disruption, we perform a series of N-body simulations of isolated minihalo–star encounters to test and calibrate analytic models of stellar encounters before applying the model to the realistic Milky Way disk environment. For tidal disruption, we perform N-body simulations to confirm the effectiveness of the analytic treatment. Finally, we propose a framework to combine the hierarchical assembly and infall of minihalos to the Milky Way with the late-time disruption mechanisms. We make predictions for the mass functions of minihalos in the Milky Way. The mass survival fraction (at Mmh ≥ 10−12M⊙) of dense dark matter minihalos, e.g., for axion miniclusters and minihalos from early matter domination, is ∼60% with the relatively low-mass, compact population surviving. The survival fraction is insensitive to the detailed model parameters. We discuss various implications of the framework and future direct detection prospects.

本研究在电弧加热设备中对L5普通球粒陨石和IAB-MG铁陨石进行了模拟实验，重现了三种飞行条件。实验结果表明，剪切应力是影响陨石烧蚀的主要因素。研究还分析了陨石的熔融外壳，获得了样本的微观结构，并通过能谱分析确定了石质陨石的元素分布，解释了石质和铁质陨石在烧蚀和再结晶过程中的差异。通过光谱分析确定了原子种类，分析了烧蚀产物。通过热蚀速率和有效热蚀热量的测量，发现了石质陨石的质量损失取决于主体的碎裂，而铁质陨石取决于熔融层的剪切损失。研究结果为理解陨石烧蚀提供了重要信息。 <div>
To observe meteorite ablation, simulation experiments were conducted on the L5 ordinary chondrite and IAB-MG iron meteorites in an arc-heated facility and three flight conditions were reproduced. To mimic the high heating rates and the significant shear stress that meteorites experience during Earth entry, the samples were machined into 9° spherical cones with a 20 mm nose radius. High-quality video, the surface temperature, a time-resolved spectrum, and infrared video were recorded. The atom species were determined via spectroscopy to analyze the ablation products. Due to the electrode erosion and dissociation of air, the atomic lines of copper, nitrogen, and oxygen were detected in all the tests. Although the copper atom is a pollutant to the flow field, the five copper lines were used to determine the flow-field temperature. The ablation rates and effective heat of ablation of both the samples were measured under different conditions. The results indicate that shear stress is the dominant factor influencing meteorite ablation. Furthermore, the diversity between stony and iron meteorites suggests that the mass loss of stony meteorites depends on the fragmentation of the main body and that of iron meteorites depends on the shearing loss of the molten layer. Then, the fusion crusts were analyzed, the microstructures of the samples were obtained, the crust thicknesses were measured, and the elemental distribution of the stony meteorites was determined via energy dispersion spectroscopy. The study results explain the differences in the ablation and recrystallization process between stony and iron meteorites.

总结: 本文采用了潮汐重建方法对红移空间中模拟星系进行了研究。研究发现，红移空间扭曲导致了各向异性的重建结果。虽然由于小尺度速度离散度较大，径向模式的重建结果更加嘈杂，但横向模式仍能以高保真度进行重建，并且与原始大尺度密度模式有很好的相关性。大尺度上重建场的偏差呈现简单的角度相关性，可以用类似于线性红移空间扭曲的形式描述。噪声功率谱在大尺度上几乎是各向同性的，且与尺度无关。这使得重建的潮汐场成为宇宙方差抵消和多探测器分析的理想示踪器，并对未来的21厘米强度映射调查产生深远的影响。<br /><br /> <div>
Gravitational coupling between large- and small-scale density perturbations leads to anisotropic distortions to local small-scale matter fluctuations. Such local anisotropic distortions can be used to reconstruct large-scale matter distribution, known as tidal reconstruction. In this paper, we apply the tidal reconstruction methods to simulated galaxies in redshift space. We find that redshift-space distortions (RSDs) lead to anisotropic reconstruction results. While the reconstructed radial modes are more noisy mainly due to the small-scale velocity dispersion, the transverse modes are still reconstructed with high fidelity, and well correlated with the original large-scale density modes. The bias of the reconstructed field at large scales shows a simple angular dependence, which can be described by a form similar to that of the linear RSD. The noise power spectrum is nearly isotropic and scale independent on large scales. This makes the reconstructed tide fields an ideal tracer for cosmic variance cancellation and multi-tracer analysis and has profound implications for future 21 cm intensity mapping surveys.

RCB stars are L ≈ 104L⊙ solar-mass objects that can exhibit large periods of extinction from dust ejection episodes. Many exhibit semi-regular pulsations in the range of 30–50 days with semi-amplitudes of 0.05–0.3 mag. Space-based photometry has discovered that solar-like oscillations are ubiquitous in hydrogen-dominated stars that have substantial outer convective envelopes, so we explore the hypothesis that the pulsations in RCB stars and the closely related dustless hydrogen-deficient carbon (dLHdC) stars, which have large convective outer envelopes of nearly pure helium, have a similar origin. Through stellar modeling and pulsation calculations, we find that the observed periods and amplitudes of these pulsations follows the well-measured phenomenology of their H-rich brethren. In particular, we show that the observed modes are likely of angular orders l = 0, 1, and 2 and predominantly of an acoustic nature (i.e., p-modes with low radial order). The modes with largest amplitude are near the acoustic cutoff frequency appropriately rescaled to the helium-dominated envelope, and the observed amplitudes are consistent with that seen in high-luminosity (L > 103L⊙) H-rich giants. We also find that for Teff ≳ 5400 K, an hydrogen-deficient carbon stellar model exhibits a radiative layer between two outer convective zones, creating a g-mode cavity that supports much longer period (≈100 days) oscillations. Our initial work was focused primarily on the adiabatic modes, but we expect that subsequent space-based observations of these targets (e.g., with TESS or Plato) are likely to lead to a larger set of detected frequencies that would allow for a deeper study of the interiors of these rare stars.

The zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) is a critical phase for stellar angular momentum evolution, as stars transition from contraction-dominated spin-up to magnetic wind-dominated spin-down. We present the first robust observational constraints on rotation for FGK stars at ≈40 Myr. We have analyzed TESS light curves for 1410 members of five young open clusters with ages between 25 and 55 Myr: IC 2391, IC 2602, NGC 2451A, NGC 2547, and Collinder 135. In total, we measure 868 rotation periods, including 96 new, high-quality periods for stars around 1 M⊙. This is an increase of ten times the existing literature sample at the ZAMS. We then use the τ2 method to compare our data to models for stellar angular momentum evolution. Although the ages derived from these rotation models do not match isochronal ages, we show that these observations can clearly discriminate between different models for stellar wind torques. Finally, τ2 fits indicate that magnetic braking and/or internal angular momentum transport significantly impact rotational evolution even on the pre-main sequence.

<title>Low- and High-velocity O vi in Milky Way-like Galaxies: The Role of Stellar Feedback</title>

<div> 关键词: 银河系, 恒星反馈, O vi, 空间望远镜, 模拟

总结: 恒星反馈对银河系中O vi吸收线的影响进行了研究。研究发现，具有适度恒星形成活动的模型可以合理地复制空间望远镜观测到的低速O vi的尺度高度、高速O vi的柱密度-线宽关系和累积O vi柱密度。相比之下，更强烈的恒星形成活动模型偏离观测。这表明超新星反馈在加热和加速星际介质中的O vi方面起着主导作用，与当前观念一致。没有超新星反馈的模型与观测结果不符，证明了超新星反馈在O vi产生中的重要性。光电离对O vi产生几乎可以忽略不计，这是因为缺乏产生O vi所需的高能光子。 <div>
Milky Way-type galaxies are surrounded by a warm-hot gaseous halo containing a considerable amount of baryons and metals. The kinematics and spatial distribution of highly ionized ion species such as O vi can be significantly affected by supernova (SN) explosions and early (pre-SN) stellar feedback (e.g., stellar winds, radiation pressure). Here we investigate effects of stellar feedback on O vi absorptions in Milky Way−like galaxies by analyzing the suites of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations under the framework of SMUGGLE, a physically motivated subgrid interstellar medium and stellar feedback model for the moving-mesh code Arepo. We find that the fiducial run with the full suite of stellar feedback and moderate star formation activities can reasonably reproduce Galactic O vi absorptions observed by space telescopes such as the Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer, including the scale height of low-velocity (∣vLSR∣ < 100 km s−1) O vi, the column density–line width relation for high-velocity (100 km s−1 ≤ ∣vLSR∣ < 400 km s−1) O vi, and the cumulative O vi column densities. In contrast, model variations with more intense star formation activities deviate from observations further. Additionally, we find that the run considering only SN feedback is in broad agreement with the observations, whereas in runs without SN feedback this agreement is absent, which indicates a dominant role of SN feedback in heating and accelerating interstellar O vi. This is consistent with the current picture that interstellar O vi is predominantly produced by collisional ionization where mechanical feedback can play a central role. In contrast, photoionization is negligible for O vi production owing to the lack of high-energy (≳114 eV) photons required.

<div> 高质量恒星形成，银河系，中心分子区，尘埃连续谱，星形成迹象<br />
总结:<br />
本文研究了银河系中心分子区潜在高质量恒星形成地点的星形成特性。使用CMZoom 1.3毫米尘埃连续谱目录识别具有典型半径约0.1帕秒的密集结构，并测量它们与高质量恒星形成迹象的关联性。通过整合来自Midcourse Space Experiment、Spitzer、Herschel和SOFIA的8、21、24、25和70微米的紧凑辐射、编目的年轻恒星物体以及水和甲醇激射器来表征每个源。发现中心分子区的潜在星形成率约为0.08 M⊙ yr−1，在未来的几十万年内。计算了中心分子区潜在星形成率的上限和下限分别约为0.45和0.05 M⊙ yr−1，大致相当于其他估计的中心分子区最近星形成率的几倍。尽管存在较大的不确定性，结果表明中心分子区的潜在星形成率可能比以前的估计要高。发现星形成迹象的普遍性与源体密度并不相关，而是≳75%的高质量恒星形成发生在柱密度比（NSMA/NHerschel）约为1.5的区域以上。最后，突出了环绕进化红外源的寒冷尘埃的atoll源的检测，可能代表了正在破坏其包层的H ii区域。 <div>
In this work, we constrain the star-forming properties of all possible sites of incipient high-mass star formation in the Milky Way’s Galactic Center. We identify dense structures using the CMZoom 1.3 mm dust continuum catalog of objects with typical radii of ∼0.1 pc, and measure their association with tracers of high-mass star formation. We incorporate compact emission at 8, 21, 24, 25, and 70 μm from the Midcourse Space Experiment, Spitzer, Herschel, and SOFIA, cataloged young stellar objects, and water and methanol masers to characterize each source. We find an incipient star formation rate (SFR) for the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of ∼0.08 M⊙ yr−1 over the next few 105 yr. We calculate upper and lower limits on the CMZ’s incipient SFR of ∼0.45 and ∼0.05 M⊙ yr−1,respectively, spanning roughly equal to and several times greater than other estimates of CMZ’s recent SFR. Despite substantial uncertainties, our results suggest the incipient SFR in the CMZ may be higher than previously estimated. We find that the prevalence of star formation tracers does not correlate with source volume density, but instead ≳75% of high-mass star formation is found in regions above a column density ratio (NSMA/NHerschel) of ∼1.5. Finally, we highlight the detection of atoll sources, a reoccurring morphology of cold dust encircling evolved infrared sources, possibly representing H ii regions in the process of destroying their envelopes.

总结: 本研究使用阿塔卡马大型毫米/亚毫米阵列望远镜对11个大型原型星团进行连续体和硫甲醛（H2CS）线345 GHz的观测，检测到145个连续核心和72个H2CS线转换，确定了H2CS的旋转温度和柱密度，并发现H2CS的丰度与柱密度正相关。这表明H2CS在不同物理环境下的星形成核心中广泛分布，并且随着温度上升而增加丰度。总之，研究结果对于理解大型原型星团中气体的温度和密度结构以及化学性质具有重要意义。<br /><br /> <div>
Investigating the temperature and density structures of gas in massive protoclusters is crucial for understanding the chemical properties therein. In this study, we present observations of the continuum and thioformaldehyde (H2CS) lines at 345 GHz of 11 massive protoclusters using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array telescope. High spatial resolution and sensitivity observations have detected 145 continuum cores from the 11 sources. H2CS line transitions are observed in 72 out of 145 cores, including line-rich cores, warm cores, and cold cores. The H2 column densities of the 72 cores are estimated from the continuum emission, which are larger than the density threshold value for star formation, suggesting that H2CS can be widely distributed in star-forming cores with different physical environments. The rotation temperature and column density of H2CS are derived using the XCLASS software. The results show that the H2CS abundances increase as temperature rises and higher gas temperatures are usually associated with higher H2CS column densities. The abundances of H2CS are positively correlated with its column density, suggesting that the H2CS abundances are enhanced from cold cores, warm cores, and line-rich cores in star-forming regions.

<div> Praesepe, Hyades, rotation–activity relation, M dwarfs, Hα emission

总结: 
本研究旨在通过对约700百万年的Praesepe和Hyades开放星团成员的观测来表征不同活动迹象在这个年龄的旋转-活动关系。通过获得新的光谱数据、X射线探测结果和旋转周期，我们得出了以下结论：在约700百万年时，几乎所有M型矮星都表现出Hα发射，联星与单星的整体颜色-Hα等价宽度分布相同；在Ro-LHα/Lbol平面上，非饱和单星遵循一个幂律，Ro > 0.3时指数为-5.9 ± 0.8；在Ro-LX/Lbol平面上，我们观察到有关Ro ≲ 0.01的单星存在超饱和迹象，并且遵循一个幂律，支持了这些恒星的日冕被离心剥离的假设；在LHα/Lbol和LX/Lbol之间几乎存在1:1的关系，这表明日冕和色球都经历了类似的磁加热过程。 <div>
Low-mass (≲1.2 M⊙) main-sequence stars lose angular momentum over time, leading to a decrease in their magnetic activity. The details of this rotation–activity relation remain poorly understood, however. Using observations of members of the ≈700 Myr old Praesepe and Hyades open clusters, we aim to characterize the rotation–activity relation for different tracers of activity at this age. To complement published data, we obtained new optical spectra for 250 Praesepe stars, new X-ray detections for 10, and new rotation periods for 28. These numbers for Hyads are 131, 23, and 137, respectively. The latter increases the number of Hyads with periods by 50%. We used these data to measure the fractional Hα and X-ray luminosities, LHα/Lbol and LX/Lbol, and to calculate Rossby numbers Ro. We found that at ≈700 Myr almost all M dwarfs exhibit Hα emission, with binaries having the same overall color–Hα equivalent width distribution as single stars. In the Ro–LHα/Lbol plane, unsaturated single stars follow a power law with index β = −5.9 ± 0.8 for Ro > 0.3. In the Ro–LX/Lbol plane, we see evidence for supersaturation for single stars with Ro ≲ 0.01, following a power law with index , supporting the hypothesis that the coronae of these stars are being centrifugally stripped. We found that the critical Ro value at which activity saturates is smaller for LX/Lbol than for LHα/Lbol. Finally, we observed an almost 1:1 relation between LHα/Lbol and LX/Lbol, suggesting that both the corona and the chromosphere experience similar magnetic heating.

<div> 关键词：宇宙学观测、原初曲率扰动、原始黑洞、快速射电暴、透镜效应<br />
总结:<br />本文首先推导了一个简单的公式来应用原始黑洞的约束条件以及单色质量分布到扩展质量分布。然后，利用最新的快速射电暴观测结果，结合透镜效应，对小尺度上两种原初曲率扰动模型进行了约束。研究结果显示，在目前可用的观测结果中，透镜效应下的快速射电暴没有检测到任何信号，在尺度范围为105-106 Mpc^-1的区域，原初曲率扰动的振幅应小于8 × 10^-2。这对应着与LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA以及未来Einstein Telescope或Cosmic Explorer探测到的双黑洞质量范围相关的一个有趣的质量范围。 <div>
Cosmological observations, e.g., cosmic microwave background, have precisely measured the spectrum of primordial curvature perturbation on larger scales, but smaller scales are still poorly constrained. Since primordial black holes (PBHs) could form in the very early Universe through the gravitational collapse of primordial density perturbations, constraints on the PBH could encode much information on primordial fluctuations. In this work, we first derive a simple formula for the lensing effect to apply PBH constraints with the monochromatic mass distribution to an extended mass distribution. Then, we investigate the latest fast radio burst observations with this relationship to constrain two kinds of primordial curvature perturbation models on small scales. This suggests that, from the null search result of lensed fast radio bursts in currently available observations, the amplitude of primordial curvature perturbation should be less than 8 × 10−2 at the scale region of 105–106 Mpc−1. This corresponds to an interesting mass range relating to binary black holes detected by LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA and future Einstein Telescope or Cosmic Explorer.

M dwarfs are common host stars to exoplanets but often lack atmospheric abundance measurements. Late-M dwarfs are also good analogs to the youngest substellar companions, which share similar Teff ∼ 2300–2800 K. We present atmospheric analyses for the M7.5 companion HIP 55507 B and its K6V primary star with Keck/KPIC high-resolution (R ∼ 35,000) K-band spectroscopy. First, by including KPIC relative radial velocities between the primary and secondary in the orbit fit, we improve the dynamical mass precision by 60% and find , putting HIP 55507 B above the stellar–substellar boundary. We also find that HIP 55507 B orbits its K6V primary star with au and e = 0.40 ± 0.04. From atmospheric retrievals of HIP 55507 B, we measure [C/H] = 0.24 ± 0.13, [O/H] = 0.15 ± 0.13, and C/O = 0.67 ± 0.04. Moreover, we strongly detect 13CO (7.8σ significance) and tentatively detect (3.7σ significance) in the companion’s atmosphere and measure and after accounting for systematic errors. From a simplified retrieval analysis of HIP 55507 A, we measure and for the primary star. These results demonstrate that HIP 55507 A and B have consistent 12C/13C and 16O/18O to the <1σ level, as expected for a chemically homogeneous binary system. Given the similar flux ratios and separations between HIP 55507 AB and systems with young substellar companions, our results open the door to systematically measuring 13CO and abundances in the atmospheres of substellar or even planetary-mass companions with similar spectral types.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
SY Cha is a T Tauri star surrounded by a protoplanetary disk with a large cavity seen in the millimeter continuum but has the spectral energy distribution of a full disk. Here we report the first results from JWST/Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) observations taken as part of the MIRI mid-INfrared Disk Survey (MINDS) GTO Program. The much improved resolution and sensitivity of MIRI-MRS compared to Spitzer enables a robust analysis of the previously detected H2O, CO, HCN, and CO2 emission as well as a marginal detection of C2H2. We also report the first robust detection of mid-infrared OH and rovibrational CO emission in this source. The derived molecular column densities reveal the inner disk of SY Cha to be rich in both oxygen- and carbon-bearing molecules. This is in contrast to PDS 70, another protoplanetary disk with a large cavity observed with JWST, which displays much weaker line emission. In the SY Cha disk, the continuum, and potentially the line, flux varies substantially between the new JWST observations and archival Spitzer observations, indicative of a highly dynamic inner disk.

<title>A New Cosmic-Ray Rejection Routine for HST WFC3/UVIS via Label-free Training of deepCR</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
deepCR is a deep-learning-based cosmic-ray (CR) rejection framework originally presented by Zhang & Bloom. The original approach requires a dedicated training set that consists of multiple frames of the same fields, enabling automatic CR labeling through comparison with their median coadds. Here, we present a novel training approach that circumvents the need for a dedicated training set, but instead utilizes dark frames and the science images requiring CR removal themselves. During training, CRs present in dark frames are added to the science images, which the network is then trained to identify. In turn, the trained deepCR model can then be applied to identify CRs originally present in the science images. Using this approach, we present a new deepCR model trained on a diverse set of Hubble Space Telescope images taken from resolved galaxies in the Local Group, which is universally applicable across all WFC3/UVIS filters. We introduce a robust approach to determining the threshold for generating binary cosmic-ray masks from predictions from deepCR probability maps. When applied to the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Southern Treasury survey, our new deepCR model added ∼7% of good-quality stars that exhibit distinct features in their color–magnitude diagrams.

<title>Can Fallback Accretion on the Magnetar Model Power the X-Ray Flares Simultaneously Observed with Gamma Rays of Gamma-Ray Bursts?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The prompt emission, X-ray plateau, and X-ray flares of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are thought to be from internal dissipation, and the magnetar as the central engine with propeller fallback accretion is proposed to interpret the observed phenomena of GRBs. In this paper, by systematically searching for X-ray emission observed by Swift/X-ray Telescope, we find that seven robust GRBs include both X-ray flares and plateau emissions with measured redshift. More interestingly, the X-ray flares/bumps for those seven GRBs are simultaneously observed in the gamma-ray band. By adopting the propeller fallback accretion model to fit the observed data, it is found that the free parameters of two GRBs (140512A and 180329B) can be constrained very well, while in the other five cases, more or less, they are not all sufficiently constrained. On the other hand, this requires the conversion efficiency of the propeller to be two or three times higher than that of the spindown dipole radiation of the magnetar. If this is the case, it is contradictory to the expectation from the propeller model: namely, a dirtier ejecta should be less efficient in producing gamma-ray emissions. Our results hint that at least the magnetar central engine with propeller fallback accretion model cannot interpret very well both the GRB X-ray flares simultaneously observed in the gamma-ray band and the X-ray flares of GRBs with a high Lorentz factor.

<title>A Population of Short-duration Gamma-Ray Bursts with Dwarf Host Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a population of 11 of the faintest (>25.5 AB mag) short gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxies. We model their sparse available observations using the stellar population inference code Prospector-β and develop a novel implementation to incorporate the galaxy mass–radius relation. Assuming these hosts are randomly drawn from the galaxy population and conditioning this draw on their observed flux and size in a few photometric bands, we determine that these hosts have dwarf galaxy stellar masses of . This is striking as only 14% of short GRB hosts with previous inferred stellar masses had M* ≲ 109M⊙. We further show these short GRBs have smaller physical and host-normalized offsets than the rest of the population, suggesting that the majority of their neutron star (NS) merger progenitors were retained within their hosts. The presumably shallow potentials of these hosts translate to small escape velocities of ∼5.5–80 km s−1, indicative of either low postsupernova systemic velocities or short inspiral times. While short GRBs with identified dwarf host galaxies now comprise ≈14% of the total Swift-detected population, a number are likely missing in the current population, as larger systemic velocities (observed from the Galactic NS population) would result in highly offset short GRBs and less secure host associations. However, the revelation of a population of short GRBs retained in low-mass host galaxies offers a natural explanation for the observed r-process enrichment via NS mergers in Local Group dwarf galaxies, and has implications for gravitational-wave follow-up strategies.

<title>Detection of CO(1−0) Emission at the Tips of the Tidal Tail in the Antennae Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The tip of the tidal tail, resulting from an encounter between galaxies, features gas concentrations and some star-forming regions, such as tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs). This region provides a unique laboratory for examining the star formation process in a dynamical environment distinct from that of disk galaxies. Using the Nobeyama 45 m telescope, we conducted 12CO(1−0) position-switching observations at the tips of the southern tidal tail in the Antennae galaxies. We detected CO emission not only from the two star-forming TDG candidates but also in regions with no significant star formation. Adopting a Galactic CO-to-H2 conversion factor without helium correction, the H2 gas surface density is ∼5–12 M⊙ pc−2. In most regions, the molecular-to-atomic gas ratio is around unity (0.6–1.9), but we find a region with a high ratio with a 3σ lower limit of >7.2. The star formation efficiency (SFE) of molecular gas is notably low (<0.15 Gyr−1), indicating less active star formation than in both nearby disk galaxies (∼0.5–1.0 Gyr−1) and other TDGs previously observed. Including previous observations, the molecular gas SFEs vary widely among TDGs/tidal tails, from 10−2 to 10 Gyr−1, demonstrating significant variations in star formation activity. Potential factors contributing to the low SFE in the Antennae tail tips include extensive tides and/or the young age of the tail.

More than 100 tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been detected at multiple bands, which can be viewed as extreme laboratories to investigate the accretion physics and gravity in the immediate vicinity of massive black holes. Future transient surveys are expected to detect several tens of thousands of TDEs, among which a small fraction may be strongly gravitationally lensed by intervening galaxies. In this paper, we statistically estimate the detection rate of lensed TDEs, with dependence on the limiting magnitude of the transient all-sky surveys searching for them. We find that the requisite limiting magnitude for an all-sky transient survey to observe at least 1 yr−1 is ≳21.3, 21.2, and 21.5 mag in the u, g, and z bands, respectively. If the limiting magnitude of the all-sky survey can reach ∼25–26 mag in the u, g, and z bands, the detection rate can be up to about several tens to hundreds per year. The discovery and identification of the first image of the lensed TDE can be taken as an early warning of the second and other subsequent images, which may enable detailed monitoring of the pre-peak photometry and spectroscopy evolution of the TDE. The additional early-stage information may help to constrain the dynamical and radiation processes involved in the TDEs.

<div> 高红移，分子流，猎户座座标，太阳质量，天体物理学
总结:
研究了高红移星系中分子流对星形成的影响，发现猎户座座标J2054-0005的OH 119μm线显示了P-Cygni型谱线，表明存在出流现象，并且该分子流速度极快，可能导致星形成迅速停止。研究还发现，在4 < z < 6.4的星形成星系和类星体中，质量流出率与红外总光度呈正相关。另外，由于出流速度极高，高达50%的分子气体可能会逸出到星系外的星际介质中。 <div>
Molecular outflows are expected to play a key role in galaxy evolution at high redshift. To study the impact of outflows on star formation at the epoch of reionization, we performed sensitive Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of OH 119 μm toward J2054-0005, a luminous quasar at z = 6.04. The OH line is detected and exhibits a P-Cygni profile that can be fitted with a broad blueshifted absorption component, providing unambiguous evidence of an outflow, and an emission component at near-systemic velocity. The mean and terminal outflow velocities are estimated to be vout ≈ 670 and 1500 km s−1, respectively, making the molecular outflow in this quasar one of the fastest at the epoch of reionization. The OH line is marginally spatially resolved for the first time in a quasar at z > 6, revealing that the outflow extends over the central 2 kpc region. The mass outflow rate is comparable to the star formation rate ( ), indicating rapid (∼107 yr) quenching of star formation. The mass outflow rate in a sample of star-forming galaxies and quasars at 4 < z < 6.4 exhibits a positive correlation with the total infrared luminosity, although the scatter is large. Owing to the high outflow velocity, a large fraction (up to ∼50%) of the outflowing molecular gas may be able to escape from the host galaxy into the intergalactic medium.

改进的WF算法通过调整交叉功率谱密度和加权平均（WA）算法估计的PSD，成功地抑制了噪声水平，重构了公共信号。对观测数据的分析结果表明，该方法成功地检测到了国际原子时间（TAI）和本地原子时间TA（NTSC）的波动。稳定性分析表明，EPT有潜力在7年以上的时间尺度上揭示TAI的不稳定性。这一改进的WF方法还可被用于通过多个原子时间标准检测和监测脉冲星时间残差中的噪声，进而改善EPT。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究提出了一种改进的Wiener滤波方法，成功应用于脉冲星时间尺度的构建，通过模拟数据和观测数据表明了其有效性，能够检测和监测原子时间的波动和不稳定性。 <div>
An improved Wiener filtration (WF) method for constructing the ensemble pulsar timescale (EPT) is proposed to solve the existing problems in the WF algorithm. The improvements consist of three parts: (i) adjusting the cross-power spectral density (PSD) and PSD estimated by the weighted average (WA) algorithm by the concept of the energy upper limit; (ii) combining the cross-PSD and WA PSD to form a different signal modulus for the filtration of residuals of different noise levels; and (iii) setting a weight for each residual by a more general algorithm based on the concept of effective power. We use this improved WF method to construct the EPT by both simulated data and observational data from the second data release of the International Pulsar Timing Array. The results from the simulated data indicate this improved WF can successfully suppress the noise level and reform the common signal. For observational data, this method also successfully detects the fluctuations of International Atomic Time (TAI) and local atomic time TA(NTSC). A stability analysis shows that an EPT will have the potential to reveal the instability of TAI on a scale longer than 7 yr. This improved WF method can also be used to detect and monitor the noise in pulsar timing residuals inversely, by using multiple atomic time standards, which can in turn improve the EPT.

<div> 关键词: Aql X-1, X-ray outburst, 磁偶极矩, 准周期爆发, 磁场强度

总结:
Aql X-1的X射线暴发光变曲线可以被中子星的吸积盘不稳定模型自然地再现，无需引入部分吸积或推进效应。通过考虑盘面纵横比h/r对X射线辐射通量计算的影响，可以自然产生光变曲线中的转折点和随后的急剧衰减。研究结果还表明，该模型可以解释Aql X-1的长期演化，与观测到的暴发周期和典型光变曲线相符。此外，估算表明，该源在休眠状态也从盘上吸积物质，并且磁偶极矩μ≲4×10^26 G cm^3（表面磁场强度B≲4×10^8 G）。 <div>
We show that the typical X-ray outburst light curve of Aql X-1 can be reproduced by accretion onto a neutron star in the frame of the disk instability model without invoking partial accretion or the propeller effect. The knee and the subsequent sharp decay in the X-ray light curve can be generated naturally by taking into account the weak dependence of the disk aspect ratio, h/r, on the disk mass-flow rate, , in the X-ray irradiation flux calculation. This dependence of h/r only slightly modifies the irradiation temperature profile along the hot disk in comparison to that obtained with a constant h/r. Nevertheless, this small difference has a significant cumulative effect on the hot disk radius, leading to a much faster decrease in the size of the hot disk and thereby to a sharper decay in the X-ray outburst light curve. The same model also produces the long-term evolution of Aql X-1, consistent with its observed outburst recurrence time and typical light curve. Our results imply that the source accretes matter from the disk in the quiescent state as well. We also estimate that the dipole moment of the source μ ≲ 4 × 1026 G cm3 (B ≲ 4 × 108 G at the surface).

Summary: 
该研究分析了来自James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)图像的3300个星系样本，涵盖红移z ≃ 3.5至z ≃ 8.5之间的对象，包括质量低至≃108M⊙的星系。研究利用JWST数据的深度和波长覆盖范围，首次得出了这些高红移、低质量星系的可靠星系质量。通过辅助CANDELS数据，计算了星系星系质量函数，结果显示了随红移增加，低质量端斜率(α)变陡，z ≃ 4时α = −1.61 ± 0.05，z ≃ 7时α = −1.98 ± 0.14。还观察到了从z ≃ 7到z ≃ 4的归一化ϕ*的演化。研究还引入了一种用于估计Eddington偏差的新方法，考虑了其可能依赖于星系质量和红移，并允许误差分布的偏度。最后计算了宇宙星系质量密度，结果显示与先前研究相比，其随红移演化较为平缓。 <br /><br />总结: 星系质量样本通过JWST数据首次得出高红移低质量星系的可靠质量。研究表明，随红移增加，星系质量函数的低质量端斜率变陡，且从z ≃ 7到z ≃ 4归一化ϕ*有演化。研究还引入了一种新方法用于估计Eddington偏差，并计算了宇宙星系质量密度，结果显示其随红移演化较为平缓。 <div>
We analyze a sample of 3300 galaxies between redshifts z ≃ 3.5 and z ≃ 8.5 selected from James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) images in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field and UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey field, including objects with stellar masses as low as ≃108M⊙ up to z ≃ 8. The depth and wavelength coverage of the JWST data allows us, for the first time, to derive robust stellar masses for such high-z, low stellar mass galaxies on an individual basis. We compute the galaxy stellar mass function, after complementing our sample with ancillary data from CANDELS to constrain the GMSF at high stellar masses ( ). Our results show a steepening of the low stellar mass end slope (α) with redshift, with α = −1.61 ± 0.05 at z ≃ 4 and α = −1.98 ± 0.14 at z ≃ 7. We also observe an evolution of the normalization ϕ* from z ≃ 7 to z ≃ 4, with . Our study incorporates a novel method for the estimation of the Eddington bias, which takes into account its possible dependence both on stellar mass and redshift, while allowing for skewness in the error distribution. We finally compute the resulting cosmic stellar mass density and find a flatter evolution with redshift than previous studies.

<div> 关键词：长时伽马射线暴，光球辐射，数值模拟，偏振分析，能谱特征。<br />
总结:<br />这篇文章研究了长时伽马射线暴中光球辐射的属性，使用了三种数值模型进行模拟，并发现了光谱峰值能量和亮度之间的相关性，以及它们与相对论速度因子的关系。然而，发现合成光谱形状比观测到的要窄，需要额外的物理过程来复现光谱特征。此外，偏振分析表明射流核心的辐射偏振度较低，但随着视角的改变而增加，而且存在大的时间变化和能量依赖性。这些发现有助于我们更好地理解长时伽马射线暴的物理机制。 <div>
We explore the properties of photospheric emission in the context of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) using three numerical models that combine relativistic hydrodynamical simulations and Monte Carlo radiation transfer calculations in three dimensions. Our simulations confirm that photospheric emission gives rise to correlations between the spectral peak energy and luminosity that agree with the observed Yonetoku, Amati, and Golenetskii correlations. It is also shown that the spectral peak energy and luminosity correlate with the bulk Lorentz factor, as indicated in the literature. On the other hand, synthetic spectral shapes tend to be narrower than those of the observations. This result indicates that an additional physical process that can provide nonthermal broadening is needed to reproduce the spectral features. Furthermore, the polarization analysis finds that, while the degree of polarization is low for the emission from the jet core (Π < 4%), it tends to increase with viewing angle outside of the core and can be as high as Π ∼ 20%–40% in an extreme case. This suggests that the typical GRBs show systematically low polarization compared to softer, dimmer counterparts (X-ray-rich GRBs and X-ray flashes). Interestingly, our simulations indicate that photospheric emission exhibits large temporal variation in the polarization position angle (Δψ ∼ 90°), which may be compatible with those inferred in observations. A notable energy dependence of the polarization property is another characteristic feature found in the current study. Particularly, the difference in the position angle among different energy bands can be as large as ∼90°.

<br />
这篇论文研究了太阳圈边界附近星际磁场线的几何形态，其中磁场线在太阳风圆层（HP）处分开，在北半球形成一片大型磁陷阱区域。磁陷阱影响着银河宇宙射线（GCRs）的传播，并预测出了环形高能离子环绕在磁陷阱内部的情况。此外，还研究了几种极端的磁场线配置，可以描述其他恒星的星际气囊。采用解析模型研究了极端星际介质磁场的情况，避免了数值磁流体力学（MHD）模型的不合理耗散，结果表明GCRs首次通过HP时倾向于穿过磁陷阱和上风方向之间的新月形区域。该论文还包括了有关太阳圈的MHD模拟结果，提供了磁陷阱中心在黄道坐标系中的坐标。 <div>
This paper examines the geometry of interstellar magnetic field lines close to the boundary of the heliosphere in the direction of the unperturbed local interstellar magnetic field, where the field lines are spread apart by the heliopause (HP). Such field parting establishes a region of weaker magnetic field of about 300 au in size in the northern hemisphere that acts as a giant magnetic trap affecting the propagation of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). The choice of an analytic model of the magnetic field in the very local interstellar medium allows us to qualitatively study the resulting magnetic field draping pattern while avoiding unphysical dissipation across the HP-impeding numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models. We investigate GCR transport in the region exterior to the heliosphere, including the magnetic trap, subject to guiding center drifts, pitch angle scattering, and perpendicular diffusion. The transport coefficients were derived from Voyager 1 observations of magnetic turbulence in the VLISM. Our results predict a ring current of energetic ions drifting around the interior of the magnetic trap. It is also demonstrated that GCRs cross the HP for the first time preferentially through a crescent-shaped region between the magnetic trap and the upwind direction. The paper includes results of MHD modeling of the heliosphere that provide the coordinates of the center of the magnetic trap in ecliptic coordinates. In addition to the heliosphere, we examine several extreme field draping configurations that could describe the astrospheres of other stars.

<div> CSO, 两个类别, CSO 2 的三个亚类, 演化和能量需求, AGN研究<br />
CSO研究结果表明，CSO包括两个无关的类别：边暗、低亮度的CSO 1和边明、高亮度的CSO 2。CSO 2还分为三个亚类：CSO 2.0具有窄喷流和/或窄叶状体的突出热点；CSO 2.2没有突出热点，具有宽喷流和/或叶状体；CSO 2.1表现出混合特性。大多数CSO2不会演化成更大的喷流活跃星系核（AGN），而是在其整个寿命中作为尺寸≲500 pc和年龄≲5000年的CSO。产生CSO 2所需的最小能量范围从∼10−4M⊙c2到∼7M⊙c2。研究显示，大多数CSO 2的暂时性质和它们的诞生率可以通过恒星的潮汐破坏事件中的点火来解释。我们还考虑了利用超大质量黑洞的自旋能量以及利用吸积盘的能量的可能性。我们的结果表明，CSO构成了一个庞大的AGN家族，我们迄今只研究过最明亮的成员。更全面的CSO研究，具有更高的灵敏度、分辨率和动态范围，将彻底改变我们对AGN和供给它们能量的中心引擎的理解。 <br /><br />总结:本研究确认CSO包括两个类别，CSO 2还分为三个亚类，并探讨了其演化和能量需求。对AGN的研究将有望得到颠覆性的提升。 <div>
We use a sample of 54 compact symmetric objects (CSOs) to confirm that there are two unrelated CSO classes: an edge-dimmed, low-luminosity class (CSO 1), and an edge-brightened, high-luminosity class (CSO 2). Using blind tests, we show that CSO 2s consist of three subclasses: CSO 2.0, having prominent hot spots at the leading edges of narrow jets and/or narrow lobes; CSO 2.2, without prominent hot spots and with broad jets and/or lobes; and CSO 2.1, which exhibit mixed properties. Most CSO 2s do not evolve into larger jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN), but spend their whole life cycle as CSOs of size ≲500 pc and age ≲5000 yr. The minimum energies needed to produce the radio luminosity and structure in CSO 2s range from ∼10−4M⊙c2 to ∼7 M⊙c2. We show that the transient nature of most CSO 2s, and their birth rate, can be explained through ignition in the tidal disruption events of stars. We also consider possibilities of tapping the spin energy of the supermassive black hole, and tapping the energy of the accretion disk. Our results demonstrate that CSOs constitute a large family of AGN in which we have thus far studied only the brightest. More comprehensive CSO studies, with higher sensitivity, resolution, and dynamic range, will revolutionize our understanding of AGN and the central engines that power them.

<div> CSOs, jetted AGN, overall size, misclassified, astrophysical studies<br />
总结:<br />
这篇文章介绍了紧凑对称天体（CSOs）的定义和分类标准，指出了原分类标准的局限性，并提出了新的CSO识别标准。通过识别79个符合新标准的CSOs，建立了一个可用于天体物理研究的CSO样本。并且指出了CSOs在特定AGN样本中的比例在6.8%到8.5%之间。 <div>
Compact symmetric objects (CSOs) are jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) with overall projected size <1 kpc. The classification was introduced to distinguish these objects from the majority of compact jetted AGN in centimeter-wavelength very long baseline interferometry observations, where the observed emission is relativistically boosted toward the observer. The original classification criteria for CSOs were (i) evidence of emission on both sides of the center of activity and (ii) overall size <1 kpc. However, some relativistically boosted objects with jet axes close to the line of sight appear symmetric and have been misclassified as CSOs, thereby undermining the CSO classification. This is because two essential CSO properties, pointed out in the original papers, have been neglected: (iii) low variability and (iv) low apparent speeds along the jets. As a first step toward creating a comprehensive catalog of “bona fide” CSOs, we identify 79 bona fide CSOs, including 15 objects claimed as confirmed CSOs here for the first time, that match the CSO selection criteria. This sample of bona fide CSOs can be used for astrophysical studies of CSOs without contamination by misclassified CSOs. We show that the fraction of CSOs in complete flux density limited AGN samples with S5GHz > 700 mJy is between (6.8 ± 1.6)% and (8.5 ± 1.8)%.

Compact symmetric objects (CSOs) are compact (<1 kpc), jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN), whose jet axes are not aligned close to the line of sight, and whose observed emission is not predominantly relativistically boosted toward us. Two classes of CSOs have previously been identified: approximately one-fifth are edge dimmed and the rest are edge brightened. We designate these as CSO 1s and 2s, respectively. This paper focuses almost exclusively on CSO 2s. Using complete samples of CSO 2s we present three independent lines of evidence, based on their relative numbers, redshift distributions, and size distributions, which show conclusively that the vast majority (>99%) of CSO 2s do not evolve into larger-scale radio sources. These CSO 2s belong to a distinct population of jetted AGN, which should be characterized as “short-lived,” as opposed to “young,” compared to the classes of larger jetted AGN. We show that there is a sharp upper cutoff in the CSO 2 size distribution at ≈500 pc. The distinct differences between most CSO 2s and other jetted AGN provides a crucial new time domain window on the formation and evolution of relativistic jets in AGN and the supermassive black holes that drive them.

总结:<br /><br />本文通过 Gemini 行星成像仪对近红外区域的碎片盘进行了观测，并分析了各个碟片的形态，找出了表明受到干扰的不对称现象。研究发现样本中有19个碟片在表面亮度、颜色、几何形状等方面呈现不对称现象，表明在散射光中，受到干扰是普遍的。研究对系统中的行星和碟片间的关系进行了讨论，并发现了恒星温度、年龄、碟片特性和观察到的干扰之间的相关性。此外，还发现了垂直宽高比与恒星温度、碟片径向延伸以及尘埃颗粒大小分布幂律参数 q 之间的显著趋势，以及碟片颜色与恒星有效温度之间的趋势。这些结果对不同光谱类型恒星周围碎片盘系统的演化具有重要的意义。 <div>
The Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) has excelled in imaging debris disks in the near-infrared. The GPI Exoplanet Survey imaged 24 debris disks in polarized H-band light, while other programs observed half of these disks in polarized J and/or K1 bands. Using these data, we present a uniform analysis of the morphology of each disk to find asymmetries suggestive of perturbations, particularly those due to planet–disk interactions. The multiwavelength surface brightness, disk color, and geometry permit the identification of any asymmetries such as warps or disk offsets from the central star. We find that 19 of the disks in this sample exhibit asymmetries in surface brightness, disk color, disk geometry, or a combination of the three, suggesting that for this sample, perturbations, as seen in scattered light, are common. The relationship between these perturbations and potential planets in the system is discussed. We also explore correlations among stellar temperatures, ages, disk properties, and observed perturbations. We find significant trends between the vertical aspect ratio and the stellar temperature, disk radial extent, and the dust grain size distribution power law, q. We also confirm a trend between the disk color and stellar effective temperature, where the disk becomes increasingly red/neutral with increasing temperature. Such results have important implications for the evolution of debris disk systems around stars of various spectral types.

这篇文章通过对X射线探测到的活动星系核（AGNs）的多波段谱能分布（SED）进行系统性分析，涵盖了60个类型1和137个类型2的AGNs，覆盖了2-10keV的光度范围。研究利用了最新的CIGALE代码，包括了含有尘埃极性组分的分析。文章提到了通过Li等人基于Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam图像的光谱分解得到可靠的类型1 AGNs的宿主和AGN参数。研究发现，X射线探测到的类型1 AGNs样本的黑洞质量（MBH）和恒星质量（Mstellar）的平均比率接近于Li等人报告的SDSS类星体的本地关系。文章还详述了UV到X射线斜率（αOX）或X射线到绝对光度的校正因子（κ2-10）随AGN光度或艾丁顿比的增加而增加的趋势。最后，文章还发现了类型1和类型2 AGNs在相同光度范围内具有类似的宿主恒星质量分布，而类型2的AGNs倾向于显示比类型1的AGNs更小的AGN光度。这支持了明亮度相关（或艾丁顿比相关）的统一方案。 <br /><br />总结: 这篇文章通过对X射线探测到的AGNs进行谱分析，展示了它们的光度、宿主星系和黑洞质量之间的关系，并强调了AGN的明亮度相关性。 <div>
We perform a systematic, multiwavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis of X-ray detected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at z = 0.2–0.8 with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) counterparts in the Stripe 82 region, consisting of 60 type 1 and 137 type 2 AGNs covering a 2–10 keV luminosity range of . The latest CIGALE code, where dusty polar components are included, is employed. To obtain reliable host and AGN parameters in type 1 AGNs, we utilize the image-decomposed optical SEDs of host galaxies by Li et al. based on the Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam images. The mean ratio of black hole masses (MBH) and stellar masses (Mstellar) of our X-ray detected type 1 AGN sample, , is close to the local relation between BH and stellar masses as reported by Li et al. for SDSS quasars. This ratio is slightly lower than that found for more luminous ( ) type 1 AGNs at z ∼ 1.5. This can be explained by the AGN luminosity dependence of , which little evolves with redshift. We confirm the trend that the UV-to-X-ray slope (αOX) or X-ray-to-bolometric correction factor (κ2–10) increases with AGN luminosity or Eddington ratio. We find that type 1 and type 2 AGNs with the same luminosity ranges share similar host stellar mass distributions, whereas type 2s tend to show smaller AGN luminosities than type 1s. This supports the luminosity-dependent (or Eddington-ratio-dependent) unified scheme.

<div> 关键词: X-ray, reverberation-mapped quasars, cosmological constraints, luminosity distance, extinction<br />
<br />
这项研究探讨了X射线侦测的回波映射类星体样本，并应用于比较活跃星系核中两个已建立的关系——X射线/紫外光度（LX–LUV）关系和宽线区半径–光度（R–L）关系所推断的宇宙学约束。研究发现，相同类星体的LX–LUV和R–L的光度距离存在差异的分布通常是不对称的，而且倾向于呈现正偏移。通过解释这种现象可能是由于紫外/X射线类星体发射受尘埃消光的结果。研究还指出，消光始终会对LX–LUV和R–L基于的光度距离之间的差异产生影响，同时得出了X射线/紫外光度色指数与光度距离差异之间的线性关系。对于当前的58个源样本来说，平均的X射线/紫外光度色指数落在mag的范围内。这种消光对LX–LUV关系的影响更为显著，因为紫外和X射线辐射的消光都在起作用。经过标准的硬X射线和远紫外线消光的筛选后，虽然严重消光的源被移除了，但整体上仍然存在正偏移。消光对光度距离的影响在LX–LUV关系中更为显著，因为紫外和X射线辐射的消光都会对其产生影响。 <br /><br />总结: 这项研究比较了X射线/紫外光度关系和宽线区半径–光度关系所推断的宇宙学约束，发现消光对光度距离产生了影响，平均X射线/紫外光度色指数落在mag的范围内，这对大多数类星体都是典型的，可能归因于宿主星系的周核和星际介质。 <div>
In Khadka et al., a sample of X-ray-detected reverberation-mapped quasars was presented and applied for the comparison of cosmological constraints inferred using two well-established relations in active galactic nuclei—the X-ray/UV luminosity (LX–LUV) relation and the broad-line region radius–luminosity (R–L) relation. LX–LUV and R–L luminosity distances to the same quasars exhibit a distribution of their differences that is generally asymmetric and positively shifted for the six cosmological models we consider. We demonstrate that this behavior can be interpreted qualitatively as arising as a result of the dust extinction of UV/X-ray quasar emission. We show that the extinction always contributes to the nonzero difference between LX–LUV-based and R–L-based luminosity distances and we derive a linear relationship between the X-ray/UV color index EX−UV and the luminosity-distance difference, which also depends on the value of the LX–LUV relation slope. Taking into account the median and the peak values of the luminosity-distance difference distributions, the average X-ray/UV color index falls in the range of mag for the current sample of 58 sources. This amount of extinction is typical for the majority of quasars and can be attributed to the circumnuclear and interstellar media of host galaxies. After applying the standard hard X-ray and far-UV extinction cuts, heavily extincted sources are removed but overall the shift toward positive values persists. The effect of extinction on luminosity distances is more pronounced for the LX–LUV relation since the extinction of UV and X-ray emissions both contribute.

We present high-cadence photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2023axu, a classical Type II supernova with an absolute V-band peak magnitude of –17.2 ± 0.1 mag. SN 2023axu was discovered by the Distance Less Than 40 Mpc (DLT40) survey within 1 day of the last nondetection in the nearby galaxy NGC 2283 at 13.7 Mpc. We modeled the early light curve using a recently updated shock cooling model that includes the effects of line blanketing and found the explosion epoch to be MJD 59971.48 ± 0.03 and the probable progenitor to be a red supergiant. The shock cooling model underpredicts the overall UV data, which point to a possible interaction with circumstellar material. This interpretation is further supported by spectral behavior. We see a ledge feature around 4600 Å in the very early spectra (+1.1 and +1.5 days after the explosion), which can be a sign of circumstellar interaction. The signs of circumstellar material are further bolstered by the presence of absorption features blueward of Hα and Hβ at day >40, which is also generally attributed to circumstellar interaction. Our analysis shows the need for high-cadence early photometric and spectroscopic data to decipher the mass-loss history of the progenitor.

总结: <br /><br />这篇文章强调了宇宙中普遍存在的二元星对于测量距离的重要性，尤其是接触双星具有的周期-光度关系可以作为距离标尺。文章提出了基于当前调查的距离测量的周期-光度-金属丰度-颜色关系模型，精度可以达到6%至8%。此外，文章还强调了基于合成光度的距离测量方法。综合来看，文章指出采用红外波段测量的PLZC或PLC关系数据可以更准确地估算距离。 <div>
Binary stars ubiquitous throughout the Universe are important. Contact binaries (CBs) possessing period–luminosity (PL) relations could be adopted as distance tracers. The PL relations of CBs are influenced by metallicity abundance and color index, which are connected to both the radius and luminosity of stars. Here we propose fine relations of the period–luminosity–metallicity–color (PLZC) from the ultraviolet to infrared bands based on current surveys. The accuracy of the distance estimation is 6% and 8%, respectively, depending on the PLZC relations of the CBs in the infrared and optical bands of the collected data. PLZC models are still more accurate than PLC models in determining intrinsic luminosity, notwithstanding their limited improvement. Meanwhile, these relations based on synthetic photometry are also calibrated. On the basis of the synthetic photometry, a 6% accuracy of distance is estimated. The measured or synthetic data of PLZC or PLC relations in infrared bands comes first in the list of suggestions for distance estimations and is followed by the measured data of optical bands.

<title>X-Ray Constraints on the Hot Gaseous Corona of Edge-on Late-type Galaxies in Virgo</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad138a</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad138a</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a systematic study of the putative hot gas corona around late-type galaxies (LTGs) residing in the Virgo cluster, based on archival Chandra observations. Our sample consists of 21 nearly edge-on galaxies representing a range of star formation rate (SFR) of 0.2–3 M⊙ yr−1 and a range of stellar mass (M*) of (0.2–10) × 1010M⊙, the majority of which have not been explored with high-sensitivity X-ray observations so far. Significant extraplanar diffuse X-ray (0.5–2 keV) emission is detected in only three LTGs, which are also the three galaxies with the highest SFR. A stacking analysis is performed for the remaining galaxies without individual detection, dividing the whole sample into two subsets based on SFR, stellar mass, or specific SFR. Only the high-SFR bin yields a significant detection, which has a value of LX ∼ 3 × 1038 erg s−1 per galaxy. The stacked extraplanar X-ray signals of the Virgo LTGs are consistent with the empirical LX–SFR and LX–M* relations found among highly inclined disk galaxies in the field, but appear to be systematically lower than those of a comparison sample of simulated star-forming galaxies in clusters identified from the Illustris-TNG100 simulation. The apparent paucity of hot gas coronae in the sampled Virgo LTGs might be understood as the net outcome of the long-lasting effect of ram pressure stripping exerted by the hot intracluster medium and in-disk star-forming activity acting on shorter timescales. A better understanding of the roles of environmental effects in regulating the hot gas content of cluster galaxies invites sensitive X-ray observations for a large sample of galaxies.

<title>MEGASIM: Distribution and Detection of Earth Trojan Asteroids</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1396</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using N-body simulation results from the MEGASIM data set, we present spatial distributions of Earth Trojan Asteroids and assess the detectability of the population in current and next-generation ground-based astronomical surveys. Our high-fidelity Earth Trojan Asteroid (ETA) distribution maps show never-before-seen high-resolution spatial features that evolve over timescales up to 1 Gyr. The simulation was synchronized to start times and timelines of two observational astronomy surveys: (1) the Vera C. Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and (2) the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). We calculate upper limits for the number of ETAs potentially observable with both the ZTF and LSST surveys. Due to the Yarkovsky Effect, we find no stable ETAs on billion-year timescales likely to be detected by any ETA survey, as no C-type or S-type ETAs (with H < 22 and H < 24, respectively) are likely to be stable on billion-year timescales, and ETAs large enough to remain stable on billion-year timescales are very rare relative to the rest of the ETA population. We find that a twilight ETA survey will not drastically increase the likelihood of individual ETA detection, but it would provide orders of magnitude more observations of select ETA populations. The null detection to date from ZTF restricts the potential ETA population to hundreds of objects larger than 100 m (at H ≈ 22), while a null detection by LSST will further restrict the ETA population to tens of objects larger than 100 m.

<title>UOCS. XIII. Study of the Far-ultraviolet Bright Stars in the Open Cluster NGC 2420 Using AstroSat</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the study of four far-ultraviolet (FUV) bright stars in the field of the open cluster NGC 2420 using the Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope mounted on AstroSat. The three stars 525, 527, and 560 are members, while star 646 is a nonmember of the cluster. To characterize and determine the parameters of these stars, multiwavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are analyzed using UV, optical, and IR data sets. For all four FUV bright stars, a two-component SED model fits well. Our findings indicate that two stars, 525 and 560, are binary blue straggler star (BSS) systems. These BSS systems may have formed in a tertiary system due to mass transfer from an evolved outer tertiary companion. Star 527 is a binary system of a BSS and an extremely low-mass (ELM) white dwarf, while star 646 is a binary system of a horizontal branch star and an ELM white dwarf. The effective temperatures, radii, luminosities, and masses of the two ELMs are (10250, 11500) K (0.42, 0.12) R⊙, (1.61, 0.23) L⊙, and (0.186, 0.170) M⊙, respectively. The star 527 could be a post-mass-transfer system and may have originated through the Case A/B mass-transfer process in a low-density environment. The cooling age of the ELMs is < 1 Myr, indicating that they have only recently formed.

<title>Galaxy Clusters from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. II. Environmental Effects on the Size–Mass Relation</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad15fd</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To investigate the environmental effects on the growth of galaxies, we study the size–mass relation across a broad range of environments with a vast sample of approximately 32 million galaxies at z < 0.5 from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. This sample is divided into three subsamples representing galaxies within three different environments: brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), other cluster galaxies, and field galaxies. The BCGs in our large sample are dominated by quiescent galaxies (QGs), while only a minority (∼13%) of BCGs are star-forming galaxies (SFGs). To demonstrate the influence of the environment on size growth, we attempt to observe the difference in size–mass relation for these three subsamples. In general, the slope differences between QGs and SFGs within various environments are significant and tend to be greater at higher redshifts. For the mass-complete subsamples at z < 0.5, BCGs are found to have the highest slope of size–mass relation, and no difference in size–mass relation is found between cluster members and field galaxies. To assess whether the observed slope differences stem from the variations in environment or mass distribution, we construct the mass-matched subsamples for QGs and SFGs. As a result, both QGs and SFGs show negligible differences in the slope of the size–mass relation among the galaxies within three distinct environments, indicating that stellar mass is the most fundamental factor driving the size evolution at z < 0.5, though the mass growth mode for QGs and SFGs may have been affected by galaxy environment.

<title>Determining the Origin of Very-high-energy Gamma Rays from Galactic Sources by Future Neutrino Observations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recently, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) identified 12 gamma-ray sources emitting gamma rays with energies above 100 TeV, making them potential PeV cosmic-ray accelerators (PeVatrons). Neutrino observations are crucial in determining whether the gamma-ray radiation process is of hadronic or leptonic origin. In this paper, we study three detected sources, LHAASO J1908+0621, LHAASO J2018+3651, and LHAASO J2032+4102, which are also the most promising Galactic high-energy neutrino candidate sources with the lowest pretrial p-value based on the stacking searches testing for excess neutrino emission by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. We study the lepto-hadronic scenario for the observed multiband spectra of these LHAASO sources considering the possible counterpart source of the LHAASO sources. The very-high-energy gamma rays are entirely attributed to the hadronic contribution; therefore, the most optimistic neutrino flux can be derived. Then, we evaluate the statistical significance (p-value) as a function of the observation time of IceCube and the next-generation IceCube-Gen2 neutrino observatory, respectively. Our results tend to disfavor that all gamma rays above 100 GeV from LHAASO J1908+0621 are of purely hadronic origin based on current IceCube observations, but the purely hadronic origin of gamma rays above 100 TeV is still possible. By IceCube-Gen2, the origin of gamma rays above 100 TeV from LHAASO J1908+0621 can be further determined at a 5σ significance level within a running time of ∼3 yr. For LHAASO J2018+3651 and LHAASO J2032+4102, the required running time of IceCube-Gen2 is ∼10 yr (3σ) and ∼10 yr (5σ), respectively. Future observations by the next-generation neutrino telescope will be crucial to understanding the particle acceleration and radiation processes inside the sources.

AT 2020mot is a typical UV/optical tidal disruption event (TDE) with no radio or X-ray signatures in a quiescent host. We find an i-band excess and rebrightening along the decline of the light curve which could be due to two consecutive dust echoes from the TDE. We model our observations following van Velzen et al. and find that the near-infrared light curve can be explained by concentric rings of thin dust within ∼0.1 pc of a ∼6 × 106 M⊙ supermassive black hole (SMBH), among the smallest scales at which dust has been inferred near SMBHs. We find dust covering factors of order fc ≤ 2%, much lower than found for dusty tori of active galactic nuclei. These results highlight the potential of TDEs for uncovering the environments around black holes when including near-infrared observations in high-cadence transient studies.

Magnetic helicity, H, measures magnetic linkages in a volume. The early theoretical development of helicity focused on magnetically closed systems in bounded by . For magnetically closed systems, , no magnetic flux threads the boundary, . Berger & Field and Finn & Antonsen extended the definition of helicity to relative helicity, , for magnetically open systems where magnetic flux may thread the boundary. Berger expressed this relative helicity as two gauge-invariant terms that describe the self-helicity of the magnetic field that closes inside and the mutual helicity between the magnetic field that threads the boundary and the magnetic field that closes inside . The total magnetic field that permeates entangles magnetic fields that are produced by current sources J in with magnetic fields that are produced by current sources J∗ in . Building on this fact, we extend Berger's expressions for relative magnetic helicity to eight gauge-invariant quantities that simultaneously characterize both of these self and mutual helicities and attribute their origins to currents J in and/or J∗ in , thereby disentangling the domain of origin for these entangled linkages. We arrange these eight terms into novel expressions for internal and external helicity (self) and internal-external helicity (mutual) based on their domain of origin. The implications of these linkages for interpreting magnetic energy are discussed and new boundary observables are proposed for tracking the evolution of the field that threads the boundary.

We present λ13 cm polarization observations of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 6946 with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) to examine the nearside halo magnetic fields. Despite λ13 cm exhibiting similar two-dimensional morphology as observed at longer (λ18–22 cm) or shorter (λ3 and λ6 cm) wavelengths, more complete frequency coverage will be required to explain the gap in polarization in the southwest quadrant of the galaxy. We fit models of the turbulent and coherent line-of-sight magnetic fields to the fractional degree of linearly polarized emission at λ3, λ6, λ13, λ18, and λ22 cm from observations taken with the WSRT, Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, and Effelsberg telescopes. The results favor a multilayer turbulent magneto-ionized medium consistent with current observations of edge-on galaxies. We constrain the physical properties of the synchrotron-emitting thin and thick disks (scale heights of 300 pc and 1.4 kpc, respectively) along with the thermal thick disk and halo (scale heights of 1 and 5 kpc, respectively). Our preferred model indicates a clumpy and highly turbulent medium within 1 kpc of the midplane, and a diffuse extraplanar layer with a substantially lower degree of Faraday depolarization. In the halo, we estimate a regular magnetic field strength of 0.4–2.2 μG and that turbulence and a total magnetic field strength of ∼6 μG result in a Faraday dispersion of σRM = 4–48 rad m−2. This work is an example of how the advanced capabilities of modern radio telescopes are opening a new frontier for the study of cosmic magnetism.

<div> LIGO/Virgo, compact object mergers, secular eccentricity oscillations, Lidov-Kozai mechanism, relativistic phase space diffusion
总结: LIGO/Virgo探测到的紧凑对象合并给双星演化和合并理论提出了挑战。一种有前途的产生合并的方法是通过由外部扰动器驱动的视向离心率振荡，可能是第三伴星或恒星团潮汐场。然而，简单的理论模型不考虑外部轨道时间尺度上的扰动扭矩的波动，可能加速合并。在通过任意球对称星团势能扰动的测试粒子四极限制中重新考虑了这些短时间尺度波动的影响，特别是包括1pN广义相对论的内部轨道近日点章动。我们发现了一个新效应，相对论相空间扩散（RPSD），它可以在外部轨道时间尺度上将双星跳到一个全新的动力学轨迹上，违反了DA积分守恒的近似。这种效应即使在分级三星系统中也会发生，但直到现在才被揭示出来。 <div>
The LIGO/Virgo detections of compact object mergers have posed a challenge for theories of binary evolution and coalescence. One promising avenue for producing mergers dynamically is through secular eccentricity oscillations driven by an external perturber, be it a tertiary companion (as in the Lidov–Kozai, LK, mechanism) or the tidal field of the stellar cluster in which the binary orbits. The simplest theoretical models of these oscillations use a “doubly averaged” (DA) approximation, averaging both over the binary’s internal Keplerian orbit and its “outer” barycentric orbit relative to the perturber. However, DA theories do not account for fluctuations of the perturbing torque on the outer orbital timescale, which are known to increase a binary’s eccentricity beyond the maximum DA value, potentially accelerating mergers. Here we reconsider the impact of these short-timescale fluctuations in the test-particle quadrupolar limit for binaries perturbed by arbitrary spherical cluster potentials (including LK as a special case), in particular including 1pN general relativistic (GR) apsidal precession of the internal orbit. Focusing on the behavior of the binary orbital elements around peak eccentricity, we discover a new effect, relativistic phase space diffusion (RPSD), in which a binary can jump to a completely new dynamical trajectory on an outer orbital timescale, violating the approximate conservation of DA integrals of motion. RPSD arises from an interplay between secular behavior at extremely high eccentricity, short-timescale fluctuations, and rapid GR precession, and can change the subsequent secular evolution dramatically. This effect occurs even in hierarchical triples, but has not been uncovered until now.

We report results of an in-depth numerical investigation of three-dimensional projection effects that could influence the observed loop-like structures in an optically thin solar corona. Several archetypal emitting geometries are tested, including collections of luminous structures with circular cross sections of fixed and random size, and light-emitting structures with highly anisotropic cross sections, as well as two-dimensional stochastic current density structures generated by fully developed magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. A comprehensive set of statistical signatures is used to compare the line-of-sight (LOS) integrated emission signals predicted by the constructed numerical models with the loop profiles observed by the extreme ultraviolet telescope on board the flight 2.1 of the High-Resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C). The results suggest that typical cross-sectional emission envelopes of the Hi-C loops are unlikely to have high eccentricity, and that the observed loops cannot be attributed to randomly oriented quasi-two-dimensional emitting structures, some of which would produce anomalously strong optical signatures due to an accidental LOS alignment, as expected in the ''coronal veil“ scenario proposed recently by Malanushenko et al. The possibility of apparent loop-like projections of very small (close to the resolution limit) or very large (comparable with the size of an active region) light-emitting sheets remains open, but the intermediate range of scales commonly associated with observed loop systems is most likely filled with true quasi-one-dimensional (roughly axisymmetric) structures embedded into the three-dimensional coronal volume.

总结:
研究发现在离银河系附近形成的矮星系倾向于在其暗物质的质量下拥有更高的恒星质量，比较孤立的矮星系在高密度环境中也倾向于生长更快，更早地形成恒星。观测预测表明这些趋势表现在更孤立的矮星系中具有更低的停止形成恒星速率，更高的氢原子分数和更蓝的颜色。整体而言，这项研究将有助于我们更好地了解局部星系群中形成的矮星系在不同环境中的演化过程。 <div>
We are entering an era in which we will be able to detect and characterize hundreds of dwarf galaxies within the Local Volume. It is already known that a strong dichotomy exists in the gas content and star formation properties of field dwarf galaxies versus satellite dwarfs of larger galaxies. In this work, we study the more subtle differences that may be detectable in galaxies as a function of distance from a massive galaxy, such as the Milky Way. We compare smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations of dwarf galaxies formed in a Local Volume-like environment (several megaparsecs away from a massive galaxy) to those formed nearer to Milky Way–mass halos. We find that the impact of environment on dwarf galaxies extends even beyond the immediate region surrounding Milky Way–mass halos. Even before being accreted as satellites, dwarf galaxies near a Milky Way–mass halo tend to have higher stellar masses for their halo mass than more isolated galaxies. Dwarf galaxies in high-density environments also tend to grow faster and form their stars earlier. We show observational predictions that demonstrate how these trends manifest in lower quenching rates, higher H i fractions, and bluer colors for more isolated dwarf galaxies.

本文使用Lyα吸收轮廓来探测星际气体泡和太阳圈层对氢墙和太阳尾的吸收。通过比较具有长“彗星状”尾巴和短“新月饼状”尾巴的蝶形模型的模拟和观测Lyα吸收轮廓，可以探索太阳圈层内和附近的中性氢。两个模型对于鼻部目标（比如半人马α星和36蛇夫座）的Lyα轮廓几乎相同。然而，向尾部目标（HD 35296）观察到了Lyα轮廓的差异。虽然新月饼模型减少了太阳尾长度，但仍然观察到了明显的顺风太阳风吸收，只比彗星模型浅了5%，速度偏移了4 km/s。这意味着不需要扩展的尾巴模型来复现太阳圈层的Lyα吸收观察。更精细的观测光栅可以解决这一速度偏移。此外，当使用较高的星际介质（ISM）中性和等离子体密度以及较低的磁场（∣BLISM∣ = 3.2 μG, αBV ≈ 40°）时，发现与观测到的Lyα轮廓更好的一致性。没有一个模型能同时在所有方向上达成一致。此外，我们发现在对星际介质条件最不确定的情况下（np,LISM, nH,LISM, TLISM, BLISM），BLISM对氢墙结构和Lyα轮廓的影响最显著。<br /><br />总结: 本文利用Lyα吸收轮廓研究了太阳圈层的结构，并发现新月饼和彗星状的尾部模型对于大部分方向上的Lyα轮廓具有相似的效果，但在某些方向上存在差异。研究表明，不需要扩展的尾部模型来复现太阳圈层的观测结果，并且较高的星际介质密度和较低的磁场可以更好地模拟观测所得的Lyα轮廓。此外，本研究强调了磁场对氢墙结构和Lyα轮廓的重要影响。 <div>
Lyα absorption profiles have been used to detect astrospheres and heliospheric absorption from the hydrogen wall and heliotail. Using magnetohydrodynamic models of the heliosphere, we can compare simulated to observed Lyα profiles to probe the neutral hydrogen within and near the heliosphere. There is an ongoing controversy whether the heliosphere has a long “comet-like” tail or a short “croissant-like” tail. Here we present the first Lyα absorption investigation using a croissant-like heliosphere. With identical boundary conditions we compare the BU model, which presents a croissant-like tail, and the Moscow model, which presents a comet-like tail. The BU and Moscow models present nearly identical Lyα profiles toward nose targets (α Cen and 36 Oph). Differences in Lyα profiles are shown toward the tail target (HD 35296). Despite the shortened heliotail of the croissant model, significant downwind heliosheath absorption is seen, just 5% shallower and shifted by 4 km s−1. This implies that an extended tail model is not required to reproduce the heliosheath Lyα absorption observations. Finer observation gratings may be able to resolve this shift. Additionally, when using higher interstellar medium (ISM) neutral and plasma densities and lower magnetic field (∣BLISM∣ = 3.2 μG, αBV ≈ 40°) than in the Moscow model, we find better agreement with observed Lyα profiles. None of the models presented show agreement in all directions simultaneously. Furthermore, we show that for the ISM conditions with the least certainty (np,LISM, nH,LISM, TLISM, BLISM), BLISM has the most significant effect on the structure of the hydrogen wall and Lyα profiles.

<br />总结:<br />本研究对银河系的两个超微弱矮星系Eri IV和Cen I进行了光谱分析。通过使用IMACS/Magellan光谱仪，确定了Eri IV和Cen I的成员星数量，并测量了它们的速度、金属丰度和其他属性。研究发现Eri IV是目前已知的金属含量最低的星系之一，并且具有略微右偏的金属丰度分布。Cen I的金属丰度较低，且金属丰度分布较宽。研究还探讨了这两个星系的固有运动、轨道和宇宙物理J因子，结果表明Eri IV在间接探测暗物质方面具有很好的潜力。研究还指出没有发现Cen I或Eri IV受潮汐剥离的明显证据。综合来说，本研究的测量确认了Eri IV和Cen I是以暗物质为主导的星系，并且具有与其他已知超微弱矮星系相一致的属性。Eri IV的低金属丰度、右偏金属丰度分布和高J因子使其成为进一步研究的特别有趣的候选星系。 <div>
We present a spectroscopic analysis of Eridanus IV (Eri IV) and Centaurus I (Cen I), two ultrafaint dwarf galaxies of the Milky Way. Using IMACS/Magellan spectroscopy, we identify 28 member stars of Eri IV and 34 member stars of Cen I. For Eri IV, we measure a systemic velocity of , and velocity dispersion . Additionally, we measure the metallicities of 16 member stars of Eri IV. We find a metallicity of , and resolve a dispersion of σ[Fe/H]=0.20 ± 0.09. The mean metallicity is marginally lower than all other known ultrafaint dwarf galaxies, making it one of the most metal-poor galaxies discovered thus far. Eri IV also has a somewhat unusual right-skewed metallicity distribution. For Cen I, we find a velocity vsys = 44.9 ± 0.8 km s−1, and velocity dispersion . We measure the metallicities of 27 member stars of Cen I, and find a mean metallicity [Fe/H] = −2.57 ± 0.08, and metallicity dispersion . We calculate the systemic proper motion, orbit, and the astrophysical J-factor for each system, the latter of which indicates that Eri IV is a good target for indirect dark matter detection. We also find no strong evidence for tidal stripping of Cen I or Eri IV. Overall, our measurements confirm that Eri IV and Cen I are dark-matter-dominated galaxies with properties largely consistent with other known ultrafaint dwarf galaxies. The low metallicity, right-skewed metallicity distribution, and high J-factor make Eri IV an especially interesting candidate for further follow-up.

Binary and dual active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are an important observational tool for studying the formation and dynamical evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes. An entirely new method for identifying possible AGN pairs makes use of the exquisite positional accuracy of Gaia to detect astrometrically variable quasars, in tandem with the high spatial resolution of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). We present a new pilot study of radio observations of 18 quasars (0.8 ≤ z ≤ 2.9), selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR16Q and matched with the Gaia DR3. All 18 targets are identified by their excess astrometric noise in Gaia. We targeted these 18 quasars with the VLA at 2–4 GHz (S band) and 8–12 GHz (X band), providing resolutions of 0.″65 and 0.″2, respectively, in order to constrain the origin of this variability. We combine these data with ancillary radio survey data and perform radio spectral modeling. The new observations are used to constrain the driver of the excess astrometric noise. We find that ∼44% of the target sample is likely to be either candidate dual AGN or gravitationally lensed quasars. Ultimately, we use this new strategy to help identify and understand this sample of astrometrically variable quasars, demonstrating the potential of this method for systematically identifying kiloparsec-scale dual quasars.

In this study we present a novel Monte Carlo code, referred to as GNC, which enables the investigation of dynamical relaxation in clusters comprising multiple mass components in the vicinity of supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. Our method is based on two-dimensional Fokker–Planck equations in the energy and angular momentum space, and allows the evolution of multiple mass components, including stars and compact objects. The code demonstrates remarkable flexibility in incorporating additional complex dynamics. By employing a weighting method, we effectively enhance the statistical accuracy of rare particle results. In this initial publication, we present the fundamental version of our method, focusing on two-body relaxations and loss cone effects. Through comparisons with previous studies, we establish consistent outcomes in terms of relaxation processes, energy and angular momentum distributions, density profiles, and loss cone consumption rates. We consistently observe the development of tangential anisotropy within the cluster, while the outer regions tend to retain near-isotropic characteristics. GNC holds great promise for exploring a wide range of intriguing phenomena within galactic nuclei, including relativistic stellar dynamics, providing detailed and insightful outcomes.

总结:
本文报告了2012年7月5日21:42的耀斑事件SOL2012-07-05T21:42，观察到在一个太阳黑子的日珥-斑晕边界出现了约3分钟周期的增强振荡现象，这一振荡在色球和日冕通道中均有观察到。在耀斑前后观察到频率的变化，耀斑前存在大约200秒的可变边日辐射，而耀斑后在相同位置观察到了180秒的加强振荡。不同通道观察到的相位差异表明了从高温到低温通道的振荡。在理论上，频率变化与磁场倾角和色球温度的变化密切相关。通过对该区域性质的分析发现，频率变化是由于磁场倾角轻微减小相对于局部垂直所导致的。此外，我们推测增强的3分钟振荡与额外的加热有关，可能是由于耀斑的极紫外晚期阶段的向下流造成的。 <div>
Three-minute oscillations are a common phenomenon in the solar chromosphere above a sunspot. Oscillations can be affected by the energy release process related to solar flares. In this paper, we report on an enhanced oscillation in flare event SOL2012-07-05T21:42 with a period of around 3 minutes that occurred at the location of a flare ribbon at a sunspot umbral–penumbral boundary and was observed in both chromospheric and coronal passbands. An analysis of this oscillation was carried out using simultaneous ground-based observations from the Goode Solar Telescope at the Big Bear Solar Observatory and space-based observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory. A frequency shift was observed before and after the flare, with the running penumbral wave that was present with a period of about 200 s before the flare coexisting with a strengthened oscillation with a period of 180 s at the same locations after the flare. We also found a phase difference between different passbands, with the oscillation occurring from high-temperature to low-temperature passbands. Theoretically, the change in frequency was strongly dependent on the variation of the inclination of the magnetic field and the chromospheric temperature. Following an analysis of the properties of the region, we found the frequency change was caused by a slight decrease of the magnetic inclination angle with respect to the local vertical. In addition, we suggest that the enhanced 3 minute oscillation was related to the additional heating, maybe due to the downflow, during the EUV late phase of the flare.

We present the first results from Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations as a part of the Fundamental Reference Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) Monitoring Experiment, a program to understand the relationship between AGN accretion physics and wavelength-dependent position as a function of time. With this VLA survey, we investigate the radio properties from a volume-complete sample of 25 hard X-ray-selected AGNs using the VLA in its wideband mode. We observed the targets in the A-array configuration at 4–12 GHz with all polarization products. In this work, we introduce our calibration and imaging methods for this survey, and we present our results and analysis for the radio-quiet AGN NGC 4388. We calibrated and imaged these data using the multiterm, multifrequency synthesis imaging algorithm to determine its spatial, spectral, and polarization structure across a continuous 4–12 GHz band. In the AGN, we measure a broken power law spectrum with α = − 0.06 below a break frequency of 7.3 GHz and α = − 0.34 above. We detect polarization at subarcsecond resolution across both the AGN and a secondary radio knot. We compare our results to ancillary data and find that the VLA radio continuum is likely due to AGN winds interacting with the local interstellar medium that gets resolved away at subparsec spatial scales as probed by the Very Long Baseline Array. A well-known ionization cone to the southwest of the AGN appears likely to be projected material onto the underside of the disk of the host galaxy.

<title>Ring Gap Structure around Class I Protostar WL 17</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
WL 17 is a Class I object and was considered to have a ring–hole structure. We analyzed the structure around WL 17 to investigate the detailed properties of this object. We used Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array archival data, which have a higher angular resolution than previous observations. We investigated the WL 17 system with the 1.3 mm dust continuum and 12CO and C18O (J = 2–1) line emissions. The dust continuum emission showed a clear ring structure with inner and outer edges of ∼11 and ∼21 au, respectively. In addition, we detected an inner disk of <5 au radius enclosing the central star within the ring, the first observation of this structure. Thus, WL 17 has a ring–gap structure, not a ring–hole structure. We did not detect any marked emission in either the gap or inner disk, indicating that there is no sign of a planet, circumplanetary disk, or binary companion. We identified the source of both blueshifted and redshifted outflows based on the 12CO emission, which is clearly associated with the disk around WL 17. The outflow mass ejection rate is ∼3.6 × 10−7M⊙ yr−1 and the dynamical timescale is as short as ∼104 yr. The C18O emission showed that an inhomogeneous infalling envelope, which can induce episodic mass accretion, is distributed in the region within ∼1000 au from the central protostar. With these new findings, we can constrain the scenarios of planet formation and dust growth in the accretion phase of star formation.

<title>A Comparative Study between M30 and M92: M92 is a Merger Remnant with a Large Helium Enhancement</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We perform a comparative study of the ex situ second-parameter pair globular clusters (GCs) M30 and M92, having similar metallicities but different horizontal branch morphologies. We obtain similar mean primordial carbon abundances for both clusters. However, M92 shows a large dispersion in carbon due to a more extended C–N anticorrelation, while M30 exhibits a higher primordial nitrogen abundance, suggesting that they have different chemical enrichment histories. Our new results confirm our previous result that M92 is a metal-complex GC showing a bimodal metallicity distribution. We also find that the metal-rich group of stars in M92 shows a helium enhancement as large as ΔY ∼ 0.05 from the red giant branch bump V magnitudes, which can also be supported by (i) a lack of bright red giant branch stars, (ii) synthetic evolutionary horizontal branch population models and (iii) the more extended spatial distribution due to different degree of the diffusion process from their lower masses. We reinterpret the [Eu/Fe] measurements by others, finding that the two metallicity groups of stars in M92 have significantly different [Eu/Fe] abundances with small scatters. This strongly suggests that they formed independently out of well-mixed interstellar media in different environments. We suggest that M92 is a more complex system than a normal GC, most likely a merger remnant of two GCs or an even more complex system. In the Appendix, we address the problems with the recently developed color–temperature relations and the usage of broadband photometry in the populational taggings.

We report the physical properties of the 18 brightest (S870 μm = 12.4–19.2 mJy) and not strongly lensed 870 μm–selected dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs), also known as submillimeter galaxies (SMGs), in the COSMOS field. This sample is part of an ALMA band 3 spectroscopic survey (AS2COSPEC), and spectroscopic redshifts are measured in 17 of them at z = 2–5. We perform spectral energy distribution analyses and deduce a median total infrared luminosity of LIR = (1.3 ± 0.1) × 1013L⊙, infrared-based star formation rate (SFR) of SFRIR = 1390 ± 150 M⊙ yr−1, stellar mass of M* = (1.4 ± 0.6) × 1011M⊙, dust mass of Mdust = (3.7 ± 0.5) × 109M⊙, and molecular gas mass of Mgas = (αCO/0.8)(1.2 ± 0.1) × 1011M⊙, suggesting that they are one of the most massive, ISM-enriched, and actively star-forming systems at z = 2–5. In addition, compared to less massive and less active galaxies at similar epochs, SMGs have comparable gas fractions; however, they have a much shorter depletion time, possibly caused by more active dynamical interactions. We determine a median dust emissivity index of β = 2.1 ± 0.1 for our sample, and by combining our results with those from other DSFG samples, we find no correlation of β with redshift or infrared luminosity, indicating similar dust grain compositions across cosmic time for infrared luminous galaxies. We also find that AS2COSPEC SMGs have one of the highest dust-to-stellar mass ratios, with a median of 0.02 ± 0.01, significantly higher than model predictions, possibly due to too-strong active galactic nucleus feedback implemented in the model. Finally, our complete and uniform survey enables us to put constraints on the most massive end of the dust and molecular gas mass functions.

<title>Disentangling Multiple Emitting Components in Molecular Observations with Nonnegative Matrix Factorization</title>

Molecular emission from the galactic and extragalactic interstellar medium (ISM) is often used to determine the physical conditions of the dense gas. However, even from spatially resolved regions, the observed molecules do not necessarily arise from a single component. Disentangling multiple gas components is often a degenerate problem in radiative transfer studies. In this paper, we investigate the use of the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) approach as a means to recover gas components from a set of blended line intensity maps of molecular transitions that may trace different physical conditions. We run a series of experiments on synthetic data sets designed to replicate conditions in two very different environments: galactic pre-stellar cores and the ISM in high-redshift galaxies. We find that the NMF algorithm often recovers the multiple components resembling those used in the data-generating process, provided that the different components have similar column densities. When NMF fails to recover all the individual components it does however group together the most similarly emitting ones. We further found that initialization and regularisation are key factors in the efficiency of the NMF algorithm.

The High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) started observing the extremely powerful long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB 221009A starting 53 hr after the triggering event. The H.E.S.S. collaboration carried out observations on 2022 October 11, 12, and 17 under poor atmospheric conditions, without detecting significant very-high-energy photons from the source and computed the upper limits of the fluxes for the different nights. We study these flux upper limits by using the photohadronic model and show that the interaction of high-energy protons with synchrotron seed photons in the forward-shock region of the GRB jet exhibits behavior compatible with the upper limits computed by the H.E.S.S. collaboration.

<title>Using the Two-point Correlation Function to Understand the Assembly Histories of Milky Way–like Galaxies</title>

The two-point correlation function (2PCF) is a powerful statistical tool to measure galaxy clustering. Although 2PCF has also been used to study the clustering of stars on subparsec to kiloparsec scales, its physical implication is not clear. In this study, we use the Illustris-TNG50 simulation to study the connection between the 2PCF of accreted halo stars and the assembly histories of Milky Way-mass galaxies. We find, in general, that the 2PCF signal increases with the increase in galactocentric radii, r, and with the decrease in the pair separations. Galaxies that assemble late on average have stronger 2PCF signals. With z1/4, z1/2, and z3/4 defined as the redshifts when galaxies accreted one-fourth, half, and three-fourths of their ex situ stellar mass today, we find they all show the strongest correlations with the 2PCF signals at r < ∼ 0.2R200. z3/4 shows the strongest correlations than those of z1/4 or z1/2. However, the correlations have large scatters. The 2PCFs in the velocity space show weaker correlations with the galaxy formation times within ∼0.35R200 than real-space 2PCFs, and the scatter is considerably large. Both the real- and velocity-space 2PCFs correlate with the assembly histories of the host dark matter halos as well. Within 0.3R200, the real-space 2PCF shows stronger correlations with the galaxy formation histories than with the halo formation histories. We conclude that it is difficult to use 2PCF alone to precisely predict the formation times or assembly histories of galaxies.

<div> 关键词: 黑洞旋转, 磁化极盘, 伽马射线暴, 赤道维度, 質量增加率
总结:<br /><br />这篇论文研究了新形成的黑洞在质量增加和角动量抽取的影响下，旋转的演化过程。通过磁化极盘模型的应用，发现黑洞如果吸积初始质量的20%，维度旋转将不可避免地达到小值a ≲ 0.2。在这种旋转下，研究人员发现该模型能够复制典型伽马射线暴喷流的能量和功率。推测出延迟的磁化极盘启动可以产生高功率的喷流，但最终旋转仍然会保持在较低水平。这些结果与通过引力波探测得出的二元黑洞合并产生的黑洞旋转低的结论一致。在另一篇论文中，观测伽马射线暴的结果被用来限制了新生黑洞的旋转为a ≃ 0.2。 <div>
The spin of a newly formed black hole (BH) at the center of a massive star evolves from its natal value due to two competing processes: accretion of gas angular momentum that increases the spin and extraction of BH angular momentum by outflows that decreases the spin. Ultimately, the final, equilibrium spin is set by a balance between both processes. In order for the BH to launch relativistic jets and power a γ-ray burst (GRB), the BH magnetic field needs to be dynamically important. Thus, we consider the case of a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) driving the spin evolution of the BH. By applying the semianalytic MAD BH spin evolution model of Lowell et al. to collapsars, we show that if the BH accretes ∼20% of its initial mass, its dimensionless spin inevitably reaches small values, a ≲ 0.2. For such spins, and for mass accretion rates inferred from collapsar simulations, we show that our semianalytic model reproduces the energetics of typical GRB jets, Ljet ∼ 1050 erg s−1. We show that our semianalytic model reproduces the nearly constant power of typical GRB jets. If the MAD onset is delayed, this allows powerful jets at the high end of the GRB luminosity distribution, Ljet ∼ 1052 erg s−1, but the final spin remains low, a ≲ 0.3. These results are consistent with the low spins inferred from gravitational wave detections of binary BH mergers. In a companion paper by Gottlieb et al., we use GRB observations to constrain the natal BH spin to be a ≃ 0.2.

The abundance of bright galaxies at z > 8 can provide key constraints on models of galaxy formation and evolution, as the predicted abundance varies greatly when different physical prescriptions for gas cooling and star formation are implemented. We present the results of a search for bright z ∼ 9–10 galaxies selected from pure parallel Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging programs. We include 132 fields observed as part of the Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies survey, the Hubble Infrared Pure Parallel Imaging Extragalactic Survey, and the WFC3 Infrared Spectroscopic Parallel survey. These observations cover a total of 620 arcmin2, about 70% of which is also covered with Spitzer Space Telescope infrared imaging. We identify 13 candidate galaxies in the range 8.3 < z < 11 with 24.5 < mH < 26.5 (−22.9 < MUV < −21.2), 11 of which constitute new discoveries. This sample capitalizes on the uncorrelated nature of pure parallel observations to overcome cosmic variance and leverages a full multiwavelength selection process to minimize contamination without sacrificing completeness. We perform detailed completeness and contamination analyses, and present measurements of the bright end of the UV luminosity function using a pseudobinning technique. We find a number density consistent with results from Finkelstein et al. and other searches in HST parallel fields. These bright candidates likely reside in overdensities, potentially representing some of the earliest sites of cosmic reionization. These new candidates are excellent targets for follow up with JWST, and four of them will be observed with the NIRSpec prism in Cycle 1.

<div> AGNs, ionized outflows, energy transfer, radiation force, SED
<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了活动星系核（AGN）的电离射流，发现能量和动量从AGN辐射传递到等离子体。辐射非常能量强劲，在距离等离子体较远的帕塞克尺度上能够导致流出。但在更靠近黑洞的地方，重力主导热能，气体处于所谓的“冷”状态，只有磁场或辐射力才能导致流出。研究表明，温度小于4×105K时，线辐射变得低效。同时，热驱动也开始与线驱动相当。此外，通过流体模拟，还说明了流出特性在从线驱动到热驱动的转变中的变化，以及它们对流出参数和SED的依赖。 <div>
Observations of ionized outflows from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide evidence of energy and momentum transfer from the AGN radiation to the plasma. The AGN radiation is very energetic. Therefore, at distances of parsec scale, where gravity is relatively weak, energy transfer alone can lead to outflow. Much closer to the black hole, gravity dominates thermal energy and the gas is in the so-called “cold” regime. Only magnetic or radiation forces can lead to outflow. However, it is unclear when the radiation force is efficient in overcoming gravity because of its dependence on the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the radiation and opacity. In this work, we survey the parameter space of radiation forces due to spectral lines resulting from blackbody SEDs with temperatures ranging from ∼104 to 106 K. The objective was to identify the radiation temperature above which line driving becomes inefficient. We find that the temperature ≲4 × 105 K marks such a transition. We also self-consistently calculate heating and cooling balance to estimate gas temperature and identify the transition where thermal driving becomes comparable to line driving. We summarize hydrodynamical simulations of radial outflows to illustrate how wind properties change during the transition from line to thermal driving and their dependence on outflow parameters and SED.

<div> 关键词: M101, 窄带成像, 恒星年龄, 螺旋结构, 星际物质

总结: 研究使用深度窄带成像技术观测了近邻螺旋星系M101，得出了其全面星际物质的恒星年龄信息。研究表明，M101存在辐射状恒星年龄梯度，同时在相对不受干扰的主盘区域发现了恒星年龄随螺旋臂距离的增加而逐渐变老的现象，这与动力学理论中大尺度冲击场景相符合。更出人意料的是，在外盘区域也发现了类似的模式，这超出了主要螺旋模式的共转半径范围。研究人员提出M101可能存在着动态或瞬变的螺旋模式，这些模式通过模式耦合形成了连贯的螺旋结构。这一情景将内向星系形成的辐射年龄梯度与动态螺旋臂理论中预测的跨臂年龄梯度结合起来，对整个星系的发展过程起到了一定的解释作用。<br /><br /> <div>
Using deep, narrowband imaging of the nearby spiral galaxy M101, we present stellar age information across the full extent of the disk of M101. Our narrowband filters measure age-sensitive absorption features such as the Balmer lines and the slope of the continuum between the Balmer break and 4000 Å break. We interpret these features in the context of inside-out galaxy formation theories and dynamical models of spiral structure. We confirm the galaxy’s radial age gradient, with the mean stellar age decreasing with radius. In the relatively undisturbed main disk, we find that stellar ages get progressively older with distance across a spiral arm, consistent with the large-scale shock scenario in a quasi-steady spiral wave pattern. Unexpectedly, we find the same pattern across spiral arms in the outer disk as well, beyond the corotation radius of the main spiral pattern. We suggest that M101 has a dynamic, or transient, spiral pattern with multiple pattern speeds joined together via mode coupling to form coherent spiral structure. This scenario connects the radial age gradient inherent to inside-out galaxy formation with the across-arm age gradients predicted by dynamic spiral arm theories across the full radial extent of the galaxy.

Shear instabilities can be the source of significant amounts of turbulent mixing in stellar radiative zones. Past attempts at modeling their effects (either theoretically or using numerical simulations) have focused on idealized geometries, where the shear is either purely vertical or purely horizontal. In stars, however, the shear can have arbitrary directions with respect to gravity. In this work, we use direct numerical simulations to investigate the nonlinear saturation of shear instabilities in a stably stratified fluid, where the shear is sinusoidal in the horizontal direction and either constant or sinusoidal in the vertical direction. We find that in the parameter regime studied here (nondiffusive, fully turbulent flow), the mean vertical shear does not play any role in controlling the dynamics of the resulting turbulence, unless its Richardson number is smaller than 1 (approximately). As most stellar radiative regions have a Richardson number much greater than 1, our result implies that the vertical shear can essentially be ignored in the computation of the vertical mixing coefficient associated with shear instabilities for the purpose of stellar evolution calculations, even when it is much larger than the horizontal shear (as in the solar tachocline, for instance).

<div> Seyfert 1 galaxy, Mrk 817, accretion disk temperature fluctuations, intrinsic variability, detrending AGN lightcurves <br />
<br />总结:
这篇文章研究了赛弗特1星系Mrk 817的紫外/光学光变曲线，产生了时间和半径分辨的黑洞吸积盘温度波动的地图。研究发现，温度波动主要受缓慢移动的径向结构控制，这与盘面变化仅由回响驱动的观念相冲突，而更可能是由盘面本身的变异引起的。作者测试了对输入光变曲线进行平滑和减法处理对结果温度地图的影响，发现多数温度波动存在较长时间尺度（数百天）。文章还探讨了如何通过去趋势化AGN光变曲线来区分由缓慢移动的温度波动和回响引起的流量变化。研究还模拟了盘面连续发射的可能受到宽线区（BLR）连续发射的污染，结果显示只有大约20%的U波段和u波段可变流量可以归因于BLR的污染。最后，研究者讨论了这些地图不仅描述了数据，还可以对AGN变异的其他方面进行预测。 <div>
We fit the UV/optical lightcurves of the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 817 to produce maps of the accretion disk temperature fluctuations δT resolved in time and radius. The δT maps are dominated by coherent radial structures that move slowly (v ≪ c) inward and outward, which conflicts with the idea that disk variability is driven only by reverberation. Instead, these slow-moving temperature fluctuations are likely due to variability intrinsic to the disk. We test how modifying the input lightcurves by smoothing and subtracting them changes the resulting δT maps and find that most of the temperature fluctuations exist over relatively long timescales (hundreds of days). We show how detrending active galactic nucleus (AGN) lightcurves can be used to separate the flux variations driven by the slow-moving temperature fluctuations from those driven by reverberation. We also simulate contamination of the continuum emission from the disk by continuum emission from the broad-line region (BLR), which is expected to have spectral features localized in wavelength, such as the Balmer break contaminating the U band. We find that a disk with a smooth temperature profile cannot produce a signal localized in wavelength and that any BLR contamination should appear as residuals in our model lightcurves. Given the observed residuals, we estimate that only ∼20% of the variable flux in the U and u lightcurves can be due to BLR contamination. Finally, we discus how these maps not only describe the data but can make predictions about other aspects of AGN variability.

<br />总结:<br />本研究利用 MaNGA 的最终数据发布版进行了对本地宇宙中后爆发星系（PSB）的大小-质量关系（SMR）和近期恒星形成历史（SFH）的研究。研究包括489个PSB星系，其中94个中心PSB区域的cPSB星系，85个环状PSB区域的rPSB星系，以及310个不规则PSB区域的iPSB星系。与类似星形成率、红移和质量的对照星系相比，所有类型的PSB样本都显示出类似的SMR，除了中心PSB星系cPSB具有中等质量处较小的尺寸。在星形成序列（iPSB-SF）中的iPSB星系显示出Dn（4000）、EW（HδA）和EW（Hα）无/弱梯度，与该类型星系的全局星形成状态一致；而寂静的iPSB（iPSB-Q）样本显示出Dn（4000）负梯度和EW（HδA）正梯度，表明内部区域具有年龄更老的恒星群。而cPSB和rPSB样本则显示出Dn（4000）正梯度和EW（HδA）负梯度，表明内部区域具有年轻的恒星群。这些结果表明，四种类型的PSB星系可以在演化路径上大致分为两类：（1）iPSB-SF和iPSB-Q，其SMR和SFH与对照星系相似，倾向于内部向外熄灭过程；（2）rPSB和cPSB，这两种类型可能是同一事件的不同阶段，并且可能是由于融合等瓦解事件所驱动的外向内熄灭过程，随着熄灭的进行，结构更加紧凑。 <div>
We study the size–mass relation (SMR) and recent star formation history (SFH) of post-starburst (PSB) galaxies in the local Universe using spatially resolved spectroscopy from the final data release of MaNGA. Our sample includes 489 PSB galaxies: 94 cPSB galaxies with central PSB regions, 85 rPSB galaxies with ringlike PSB regions, and 310 iPSB galaxies with irregular PSB regions. When compared to control galaxies of similar star formation rate, redshift, and mass, a similar SMR is found for all types of PSB samples except the cPSB galaxies, which have smaller sizes at intermediate masses ( ). The iPSB galaxies in the star-forming sequence (iPSB-SF) show no/weak gradients in Dn(4000), EW(HδA), and EW(Hα), consistent with the global star-forming status of this type of galaxy, while the quiescent iPSB (iPSB-Q) sample shows negative gradients in Dn(4000) and positive gradients in EW(HδA), indicating older stellar populations in the inner regions. Both the cPSB and rPSB samples show positive gradients in Dn(4000) and negative gradients in EW(HδA), indicating younger stellar populations in the inner regions. These results imply that the four types of PSB galaxies can be broadly divided into two distinct categories in terms of evolutionary pathway: (1) iPSB-SF and iPSB-Q, which have SMRs and SFHs similar to control galaxies, preferring an inside-out quenching process, and (2) rPSB and cPSB, which appear to be different stages of the same event and likely to follow the outside-in quenching process driven by disruption events such as mergers that result in a more compact structure as quenching proceeds.

总结:
太阳大规模耀斑和物质抛射的理解需要对整个系统的演变进行详细的研究，包括包围源区的磁环境以及事件发生前的先兆活动的搜索。通过结合来自太阳动力学观测卫星（SDO）和STEREO-B太空船的立体观测，我们能够观察到2011年10月1日NOAA活跃区（AR）11305发生的一个丝状物质抛射、M1.2级爆发性耀斑和日冕物质抛射（CME）前几个小时的情况。我们发现在被抛射的丝状物质的东南方有两次明显的先兆性日冕变暗。在爆发期间，CME以相当大的速度向变暗区域迅速蔓延。我们利用SDO/Helioseismic和磁场观测仪（HMI）数据重建了系统的磁环境，并发现在变暗区域附近存在一个零点。活跃区11305与附近的AR 11302和11306以及其他衰减活跃区的联系十分复杂。先兆性的变暗伴随着环向上升的回环和朝零点方向的东南运动，以及朝远离的方向的东北和西南运动。这些运动和变暗与零点处持续的磁重连一致，因此在上升和东南移动时清除了AR 11305上方的拉紧磁场。最终，丝状物质以爆炸方式向零点抛射。我们得出结论，太阳耀斑的断裂模型对此事件提供了令人信服的解释。此外，我们推测先兆性的变暗可能比目前认识的要频繁得多。 <div>
Understanding large-scale solar eruptions requires detailed investigation of the entire system’s evolution, including the magnetic environment enveloping the source region and searches for precursor activity prior to event onset. We combine stereoscopic observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and STEREO-B spacecraft for several hours before a filament ejection, M1.2-class eruptive flare, and coronal mass ejection (CME) originating in NOAA active region (AR) 11305 on 2011 October 1. Two episodes of significant preeruption coronal dimming that occurred well to the southeast of the ejected filament are identified. The CME subsequently took off with a substantial component of velocity toward the dimming, which became very pronounced during eruption. We used SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) data to reconstruct the magnetic environment of the system and found that it contains a null point near the dimming region. AR 11305 had quite complex connections to nearby ARs 11302 and 11306, as well as to other regions of decayed AR flux. The intensifying and spatially expanding precursor dimming was accompanied by southeastward rising motions of loops toward the null point and northeastward and southwestward motions of loops retracting away. These motions and the dimming are consistent with persistent magnetic reconnection occurring at the null point as it moved upward and southeastward, thereby removing a strapping magnetic field high above AR 11305. Eventually, the filament was ejected explosively toward the null point. We conclude that the breakout model for solar eruptions provides a compelling account of this event. Furthermore, we conjecture that preeruption dimmings may be much more frequent than currently recognized.

<div> 年轻星团，银河系宇宙射线加速器，CR传输模型，宇宙射线谱，星团加速⇥<br />
年轻、巨大的星团可能是能够加速银河系宇宙射线（CRs）至107–109 GeV（在“膝部”和“踝部”之间）范围内的候选者。通过考虑CR在星团周围的扩散、传播过程中的相互作用损失以及老式超新星遗迹对粒子的再加速效应，我们展示了一种银河系CR传输模型。我们提出了一种可能的模型，即利用观测到的银河系平面上年轻星团的分布，来解释CR中不同核的产生过程。我们的模型要求CR的源谱具有指数截断为5×107Z GeV（50Z PeV）的特性，并且来自于这些星团，同时还需要约占风动力学能量的5%来加速。最后，我们讨论了在考虑星团作为银河系“第二成分”CR的自然加速器时，实现这些要求的可能性和相关的不确定性。<br /><br />总结:年轻、巨大的星团可能是加速银河系宇宙射线的候选者，通过考虑CR的传输、再加速效应和观测到的星团分布来阐述了这一可能性。该模型需要CR的源谱具有特定的特征，并且需要一定比例的能量来加速。最后讨论了这一模型的可能性和不确定性。 <div>
We show that massive, young star clusters may be possible candidates that can accelerate Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) in the range of 107–109 GeV (between the “knee” and “ankle”). Various plausible scenarios, such as acceleration at the wind termination shock and supernova shocks inside these young star clusters, have been proposed, since it is difficult to accelerate particles up to the 107–109 GeV range in the standard paradigm of CR acceleration in supernova remnants. We consider a model for the production of different nuclei in CRs from massive stellar winds using the observed distribution of young star clusters in the Galactic plane. We present a detailed calculation of CR transport in the Galaxy, taking into account the effect of diffusion, interaction losses during propagation, and particle reacceleration by old supernova remnants to determine the all-particle CR spectrum. Using the maximum energy estimate from the Hillas criterion, we argue that a young, massive star cluster can accelerate protons up to a few tens of PeV. Upon comparison with the observed data, our model requires a CR source spectrum with an exponential cutoff of 5 × 107Z GeV (50 Z PeV) from these clusters, together with a CR injection fraction of ∼5% of the wind kinetic energy. We discuss the possibility of achieving these requirements in star clusters, as well as the associated uncertainties, in the context of considering star clusters as the natural accelerator of the “second component” of Galactic CRs.

<div> 长周期，无线电发射，中子星，白矮星，磁场
总结:<br /><br />最近发现了两个无线电发射源，周期分别为18分钟和21分钟。它们的明亮无线电发射类似于无线电磁体，但其长周期和在其他波长上的检测缺乏挑战了中子星的解释。相反，长旋转周期在白矮星中很常见，但尽管有预测，从孤立的磁性白矮星中未曾明确观测到偶极无线电发射。研究人员对这些长周期对象进行了调查，作为孤立中子星或白矮星的偶极无线电发射源，并发现两种情况都对我们对通过对偶极磁层中的对产生无线电发射的理解构成重大挑战。他们进行了基于两种图像中的偶极自旋衰减的群体合成模拟，假设不同的初始周期分布、质量、半径、束流分数和磁场预测，以评估超长脉冲星数量对其影响。在中子星场景中，根据任何物理上合理的（甚至是极端的）周期演化假设，我们不指望有大量超长周期脉冲星存在。另一方面，在白矮星情景中，我们可以轻松容纳大量长周期无线电发射源。然而，无法轻松解释这两种场景中产生如此明亮的相干无线电发射的机制。 <div>
The nature of two recently discovered radio emitters with unusually long periods of 18 minutes (GLEAM-X J1627–52) and 21 minutes (GPM J1839–10) is highly debated. Their bright radio emission resembles that of radio magnetars, but their long periodicities and lack of detection at other wavelengths challenge the neutron star (NS) interpretation. In contrast, long rotational periods are common in white dwarfs (WDs) but, although predicted, dipolar radio emission from isolated magnetic WDs has never been unambiguously observed. In this work, we investigate these long-period objects as potential isolated NS or WD dipolar radio emitters and find that both scenarios pose significant challenges to our understanding of radio emission via pair production in dipolar magnetospheres. We also perform population-synthesis simulations based on dipolar spin-down in both pictures, assuming different initial-period distributions, masses, radii, beaming fractions, and magnetic field prescriptions, to assess their impact on the ultra-long pulsar population. In the NS scenario, we do not expect a large number of ultra-long-period pulsars under any physically motivated (or even extreme) assumptions for the period evolution. On the other hand, in the WD scenario, we can easily accommodate a large population of long-period radio emitters. However, no mechanism can easily explain the production of such bright coherent radio emission in either scenarios.

<title>Energy-dependent Analyses of the Gamma-Ray Emission from HESS J1857+026 with Fermi-LAT</title>

We report the discovery of the energy-dependent morphology of the GeV gamma-ray emission from HESS J1857+026 with more than 13 yr of Fermi Large Area Telescope data. The GeV gamma-ray emission from this region is composed of two extended components. The hard component with an index of 1.74 ± 0.07 in the energy range of 0.5–500 GeV is spatially coincident with HESS J1857+026, and its 68% containment radius varies from ∼0.°44 below 40 GeV to ∼0.°30 above 140 GeV. The hard GeV gamma-ray spectrum and the energy-dependent morphology of HESS J1857+026 make it favor a pulsar wind nebula origin, which is associated with the energetic pulsar PSR J1856+0245. The soft component with an index of 2.70 ± 0.16 and another extended gamma-ray source detected in this region, 4FGL J1857.9+0313e, with an index of 2.55 ± 0.07, are spatially coincident with two molecular clumps in the northeast and southwest of HESS J1857+026, which favors the hadronic process, and the protons could be accelerated by the hypothetical supernova remnant associated with PSR J1856+0245.

<title>A New Population of Mid-infrared-selected Tidal Disruption Events: Implications for Tidal Disruption Event Rates and Host Galaxy Properties</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Most tidal disruption events (TDEs) are currently found in time-domain optical and soft X-ray surveys, both of which are prone to significant obscuration. The infrared (IR), however, is a powerful probe of dust-enshrouded environments; hence, we recently performed a systematic search of NEOWISE mid-IR data for nearby, obscured TDEs within roughly 200 Mpc. We identified 18 TDE candidates in galactic nuclei, using difference imaging to uncover nuclear variability among significant host galaxy emission. These candidates were selected based on the following IR light-curve properties: (1) LW2 ≳ 1042 erg s−1 at peak; (2) fast rise, followed by a slow, monotonic decline; (3) no significant prior variability; and (4) no evidence for active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity in Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) colors. The majority of these sources showed no variable optical counterpart, suggesting that optical surveys indeed miss numerous obscured TDEs. Using narrow-line ionization levels and variability arguments, we identified six sources as possible underlying AGN, yielding a total of 12 TDEs in our gold sample. This gold sample yields a lower limit on the IR-selected TDE rate of (2.0 ± 0.3) × 10−5 galaxy−1 yr−1 ((1.3 ± 0.2) × 10−7 Mpc−3 yr−1), which is comparable to optical and X-ray TDE rates. The IR-selected TDE host galaxies do not show a green valley overdensity nor as a preference for quiescent, Balmer strong galaxies, which are both overrepresented in optical and X-ray TDE samples. This IR-selected sample represents a new population of dusty TDEs that have historically been missed by optical and X-ray surveys and helps alleviate tensions between observed and theoretical TDE rates and the so-called missing energy problem.

这篇文章介绍了一种新的方法，通过分析H i 21厘米线发射的亮度温度谱和其傅立叶变换来空间映射冷中性介质的质量分数下限。这一方法不需要吸收线数据，可以单独利用21厘米发射线数据提取H i 气体的综合性质，并分别映射每个相位。研究使用玩具模型阐明了在傅立叶变换中所看到的干涉图案的起源。通过对热双稳湍流的数值模拟进行测试，证明了该方法得出的冷气体质量分数下限与模拟的“真实”冷气体质量分数呈强线性相关。在NH I≳3–5×1020 cm−2时，与吸收调查的比较显示了类似的行为, 这一方法还揭示了DRAO深空领域的冷丝状结构以及HI4PI调查的全天图。这一新方法具有能够单独提取冷气体质量分数下限并适用于大量发射线数据的特点，计算时间和内存占用较低，并为新一代射电干涉仪提供了新的途径。

We develop a new method for spatially mapping a lower limit on the mass fraction of the cold neutral medium by analyzing the amplitude structure of , the Fourier transform of Tb(v), the spectrum of the brightness temperature of the H i 21 cm line emission with respect to the radial velocity v. This advances a broader effort exploiting 21 cm emission line data alone (without absorption line data, τ) to extract integrated properties of the multiphase structure of the H i gas and to map each phase separately. Using toy models, we illustrate the origin of interference patterns seen in . Building on this, a lower limit on the cold gas mass fraction is obtained from the amplitude of at high kv. Tested on a numerical simulation of thermally bi-stable turbulence, the lower limit from this method has a strong linear correlation with the “true” cold gas mass fraction from the simulation for a relatively low cold gas mass fraction. At a higher mass fraction, our lower limit is lower than the “true” value, because of a combination of interference and opacity effects. Comparison with absorption surveys shows a similar behavior, with a departure from linear correlation at NH I ≳ 3–5 × 1020 cm−2. Application to the DRAO Deep Field from DHIGLS reveals a complex network of cold filaments in the Spider, an important structural property of the thermal condensation of the H i gas. Application to the HI4PI survey in the velocity range −90 < v < 90 km s−1 produces a full sky map of a lower limit on the mass fraction of the cold neutral medium at 16.′2 resolution. Our new method has the ability to extract a lower limit on the cold gas mass fraction for massive amounts of emission line data alone with low computing time and memory, pointing the way to new approaches suitable for the new generation of radio interferometers.

<div> GNIRS, atmosphere model, C/O ratio, T dwarf, near-infrared spectra
<br /><br />总结:
本文扩展了ATMO 2020大气模型网格，以包括非太阳金属丰度和T矮星区的C/O比率。通过改变碳或氧元素丰度，发现这些元素的非太阳丰度可以基于H和K波段的形状来区分。通过比较这些新模型与三个基准晚期T矮星（GJ 570D、HD 3651B和Ross 458C）的Gemini近红外光谱仪（GNIRS）近红外（0.8–2.4 μm）中分辨率（R ≈ 1700）的光谱，发现在近红外光谱中存在模型-数据差异。排除了模型对分辨率的分子吸收表的假设的不足。最后，发现Ross 458C的GNIRS、SpeX和其他近红外光谱之间存在偏差，表明存在潜在的光谱变化。 <div>
Measurements of the C/O ratio in brown dwarfs are lacking, in part due to past models adopting solar C/O only. We have expanded the ATMO 2020 atmosphere model grid to include nonsolar metallicities and C/O ratios in the T dwarf regime. We change the C/O ratio by altering either the carbon or oxygen elemental abundances, and we find that nonsolar abundances of these elements can be distinguished based on the shapes of the H and K bands. We compare these new models with medium-resolution (R ≈ 1700), near-infrared (0.8–2.4 μm) Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph (GNIRS) spectra of three benchmark late-T dwarfs, GJ 570D, HD 3651B, and Ross 458C. We find solar C/O ratios and best-fitting parameters (Teff, , Z) broadly consistent with other analyses in the literature based on low-resolution (R ∼ 100) data. The model-data discrepancies in the near-infrared spectra are consistent across all three objects. These discrepancies are alleviated when fitting the Y, J, H, and K bands individually, but the resulting best-fit parameters are inconsistent and disagree with the results from the full spectrum. By examining the model atmosphere properties we find this is due to the interplay of gravity and metallicity on H2–H2 collisionally induced absorption. We therefore conclude that there are no significant issues with the molecular opacity tables used in the models at this spectral resolution. Instead, deficiencies are more likely to lie in the model assumptions regarding the thermal structures. Finally, we find a discrepancy between the GNIRS, SpeX, and other near-infrared spectra in the literature of Ross 458C, indicating potential spectroscopic variability.

总结:<br />这项研究利用宇宙N体模拟中的星系红移调查数据，构建了星系聚集统计的高斯过程模拟器，以约束宇宙学和星系偏置参数。除了标准统计学之外，还模拟了包括有关局部环境信息的统计学，这扩展了Aemulus III对红移空间畸变的模型。该研究发现，超越标准统计学的额外统计学可以显著提高对感兴趣的宇宙学参数的约束能力。此外，研究还发现小尺度（约6 h^-1 Mpc以下）包含与大尺度同样多的信息，密度敏感的统计学对约束占有分布参数和灵活的环境相关组装偏差模型也做出了贡献。这一分析证明了在小尺度模拟超越标准聚类统计学的潜力，以约束结构的增长作为对宇宙加速膨胀的检验。 <div>
There is untapped cosmological information in galaxy redshift surveys in the nonlinear regime. In this work, we use the Aemulus suite of cosmological N-body simulations to construct Gaussian process emulators of galaxy clustering statistics at small scales (0.1–50 h−1 Mpc) in order to constrain cosmological and galaxy bias parameters. In addition to standard statistics—the projected correlation function wp(rp), the redshift-space monopole of the correlation function ξ0(s), and the quadrupole ξ2(s)—we emulate statistics that include information about the local environment, namely the underdensity probability function PU(s) and the density-marked correlation function M(s). This extends the model of Aemulus III for redshift-space distortions by including new statistics sensitive to galaxy assembly bias. In recovery tests, we find that the beyond-standard statistics significantly increase the constraining power on cosmological parameters of interest: including PU(s) and M(s) improves the precision of our constraints on Ωm by 27%, σ8 by 19%, and the growth of structure parameter, fσ8, by 12% compared to standard statistics. We additionally find that scales below ∼6 h−1 Mpc contain as much information as larger scales. The density-sensitive statistics also contribute to constraining halo occupation distribution parameters and a flexible environment-dependent assembly bias model, which is important for extracting the small-scale cosmological information as well as understanding the galaxy–halo connection. This analysis demonstrates the potential of emulating beyond-standard clustering statistics at small scales to constrain the growth of structure as a test of cosmic acceleration.

The disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) is widely regarded as a prominent formation channel of binary black hole (BBH) mergers that can be detected through gravitational waves (GWs). Besides, the presence of dense environmental gas offers the potential for an embedded BBH merger to produce electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. In this paper, we investigate EM emission powered by the kicked remnant of a BBH merger occurring within the AGN disk. The remnant BH will launch a jet via the accretion of a magnetized medium as it traverses the disk. The resulting jet will decelerate and dissipate energy into a lateral cocoon as it propagates. We explore three radiation mechanisms of the jet–cocoon system—jet breakout emission, disk cocoon cooling emission, and jet cocoon cooling emission—and find that the jet cocoon cooling emission is likely to be detected in its own frequency bands. We predict a soft X-ray transient, lasting for O(103) s, to serve as an EM counterpart, of which the time delay O(10) days after the GW trigger contributes to follow-up observations. Consequently, BBH mergers in the AGN disk represent a novel multimessenger source. In the future, enhanced precision in measuring and localizing GWs, coupled with diligent searches for such associated EM signals, will effectively validate or restrict the origin of BBH mergers in the AGN disk.

<div> 关键词: GDXE, X射线源, 光谱拟合, 超新星遗迹, Sgr A*<br />
总结: 
本文研究了银河系扩散X射线辐射的光谱特性以及可能的起源。研究发现，GDXE的X射线光谱主要由紧凑X射线源和扩散X射线源组成。在对GCXE、GRXE和GBXE的光谱拟合中发现了额外的数据超量，经过分析发现这些超量可能来自碰撞电离平衡等离子体。通过添加碰撞电离平衡超新星遗迹的假设，改善了GRXE和GBXE的光谱拟合情况。然而，GCXE的光谱仍然不可接受，进一步的分析显示额外的数据超量可能来自辐合等离子体超新星遗迹。最后，研究提出了一种将所有紧凑X射线源和扩散X射线源结合起来的光谱拟合方法，可以定量和全面地预测GDXE光谱的起源。这为我们深入理解银河系X射线辐射的起源提供了新的解释。 <div>
Galactic diffuse X-ray emission (GDXE) can be spatially segmented into Galactic center X-ray emission (GCXE), Galactic ridge X-ray emission (GRXE), and Galactic bulge X-ray emission (GBXE). The X-ray spectra of GDXE are expressed by the assembly of compact X-ray sources, which are either white dwarfs (WDs) or X-ray active stars consisting of binaries with late-type stars. WDs have either a strong magnetic field or a weak magnetic field. WDs and X-ray active stars are collectively called compact X-ray stars. However, spectral fittings by the assembly of all compact X-ray stars for GCXE, GRXE, and GBXE are rejected, leaving significant excess near the energies of the Kα, Heα, and Lyα lines. These excesses are found in the collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE) plasma. Thus, the spectra of GRXE and GBXE are improved by adding CIE supernova remnants (SNRs). However, the GCXE spectrum is still unacceptable, with significant data excess due to radiative recombination emission (recombining plasma (RP)). The GCXE fit is then significantly improved by adding aged RP-SNRs. Aged RP-SNRs are made by a past big flare of Sgr A* emitting either hard X-rays or low-energy cosmic rays. The big flares may excite Fe and Ni atoms in cold diffuse gas (cold matter (CM)) and emit fluorescent X-ray lines. The CIE-SNRs, RP-SNRs, and CM are called diffuse X-ray sources. This paper presents the spectral fits by the assembly of all the compact and diffuse X-ray sources together with high-quality spectra and a combined fit among all the GDXE of GCXE, GRXE, and GBXE. This provides the first scenario to quantitatively and comprehensively predict the origin of the GDXE spectra.

总结:
本文研究了高银纬处的星际尘埃对天文背景减除、产生弥散散射光以及软化类星体的紫外光谱的影响。作者使用氢柱密度（H i和H2）和远红外（FIR）估计的尘埃红化来评估星际“气尘比”NH/E(B − V)，发现在银河平面这一比值为6.0 ± 0.2（以1021 cm−2 mag−1为单位）。研究发现在低红化视线中，最近的Planck对E(B − V)的估计比Schlafly & Finkbeiner高12%，同时NH I在不同的射电望远镜测量时存在显著变化。在对51个测量了H i和H2的类星体进行研究后，发现使用Planck E(B − V)数据得到的平均比值为10.3 ± 0.4（所有速度的气体）和9.2 ± 0.3（仅低速气体）。高银纬处的H2分数普遍很小（平均为2%–3%），但在39个∣b∣ ≥ 40°的视线中有9个具有1%–17%的fH2。由于FIR推断的E(B − V)对模拟尘埃温度Td和发射指数β很敏感，在低E(B − V)时，气尘比具有大的、不对称的误差。研究发现在具有高速云的视线中，气尘比升高，而高速气体贡献了NH但几乎没有红化。在Complex C中，当排除高速气体时，比值下降了40%。作者预期在银河平面上方的低金属气体中将会观察到尘埃含量的减少，这是因为在冲击中颗粒被破坏，沉降到盘面，以及在热晕气体中的热喷发。 <div>
Interstellar dust at high Galactic latitudes can influence astronomical foreground subtraction, produce diffuse scattered light, and soften the UV spectra of quasars. In a sample of 94 sight lines toward quasars at high latitude and low extinction, we evaluate the interstellar “gas-to-dust ratio” NH/E(B − V), using hydrogen column densities (H i and H2) and far-IR (FIR) estimates of dust reddening. In the Galactic plane, this ratio is 6.0 ± 0.2 (in units of 1021 cm−2 mag−1). On average, recent Planck estimates of E(B − V) in low-reddening sight lines are 12% higher than those from Schlafly & Finkbeiner, and NH I exhibits significant variations when measured at different radio telescopes. In a sample of 51 quasars with measurements of both H i and H2 and 0.01 ≤ E(B − V) ≲ 0.1, we find mean ratios 10.3 ± 0.4 (gas at all velocities) and 9.2 ± 0.3 (low-velocity only) using Planck E(B − V) data. High-latitude H2 fractions are generally small (2%–3% on average), although nine of 39 sight lines at ∣b∣ ≥ 40° have fH2 of 1%–17%. Because FIR-inferred E(B − V) is sensitive to modeled dust temperature Td and emissivity index β, gas-to-dust ratios have large, asymmetric errors at low E(B − V). The ratios are elevated in sight lines with high-velocity clouds, which contribute NH but little reddening. In Complex C, the ratio decreases by 40% when high-velocity gas is excluded. Decreases in dust content are expected in low-metallicity gas above the Galactic plane, resulting from grain destruction in shocks, settling to the disk, and thermal sputtering in hot halo gas.

About a dozen exoplanetary systems have been discovered with three or more planets participating in a sequence of mean-motion resonances. The unique and complex architectures of these so-called “resonant chains” motivate efforts to characterize their planets holistically. In this work, we perform a comprehensive exploration of the spin-axis dynamics of planets in resonant chains. Planetary spin states are closely linked with atmospheric dynamics and habitability and are thus especially relevant to resonant chains like TRAPPIST-1, which hosts several temperate planets. Considering a set of observed resonant chains, we calculate the equilibrium states of the planetary axial tilts (“obliquities”). We show that high-obliquity states exist for ∼60% of planets in our sample, and many of these states can be stable in the presence of tidal dissipation. Using case studies of two observed systems (Kepler-223 and TOI-1136), we demonstrate how these high-obliquity states could have been attained during the initial epoch of disk-driven orbital migration that established the resonant orbital architectures. We show that the TRAPPIST-1 planets most likely have zero obliquities, with the possible exception of planet d. Overall, our results highlight that both the orbital and spin states of resonant chains are valuable relics of the early stages of planet formation and evolution.

Common envelope evolution (CEE) is vital for forming short-orbital-period compact binaries. It covers many objects, such as double compact merging binaries, Type Ia supernovae progenitors, binary pulsars, and X-ray binaries. Knowledge of the common envelope (CE) ejection efficiency still needs to be improved, though progress has been made recently. Short-orbital-period hot subdwarf B star (sdB) plus white dwarf (WD) binaries are the most straightforward samples with which to constrain CEE physics. We apply the known orbital period–WD mass relation to constrain the sdB progenitors of seven sdB+WD binaries with a known inclination angle. The average CE efficiency parameter is 0.32. This is consistent with previous studies. However, the CE efficiency need not be constant, but a function of the initial mass ratio, based on well-constrained sdB progenitor mass and evolutionary stage. Our results can be used as physical inputs for binary population synthesis simulations of related objects. A similar method can also be applied to study other short-orbital-period WD binaries.

二元中子星融合可能产生快速移动的准等向材料喷发，导致热辐射和产生重元素的喷晕发射。与环境的相互作用会产生外部冲击，可能在并合后几十年持续产生持久的无线电信号。与超新星喷发相比，喷晕喷发的质量相对较小，速度更高，其扩展最终可能导致喷发密度变得很低，介质颗粒可以自由穿过喷发。这可能导致一种不完全的扫描对星际介质。使用玩具模型，研究发现这种不完全的扫描可以显著减少晚期无线电辐射功率，无论二元中子星融合是否导致黑洞或中子星的形成。因此，我们的发现意味着先前报告的某些短暴射线爆发的无线电上限可能并不一定对这些短暴射线爆发中存在长寿命磁星遗留下严格的限制。<br /><br />总结: 本研究揭示了二元中子星融合产生的喷发对周围环境的影响，以及其对无线电辐射的潜在影响。研究发现，喷发可能导致一种不完全的扫描对星际介质，从而减少无线电辐射功率。这一发现意味着先前对短暴射线爆发的无线电上限并不一定能够限制其中是否存在长寿命磁星遗留。 <div>
The coalescence of binary neutron stars can yield the expulsion of a fast-moving, quasi-isotropic material, which may induce thermal radiation and give rise to kilonova emission. Moreover, the interaction between the ejected material and the surrounding environment generates an external shock, which can result in a long-lasting radio signal that persists for several decades following the merger. In contrast to supernova ejecta, the kilonova ejecta exhibits a relatively lesser mass and higher velocity, and its expansion may ultimately result in the ejecta density becoming so low that the medium particles can freely pass through the ejecta. It would thereby lead to a kind of incomplete sweeping on the interstellar medium. Employing a toy model, our investigation reveals that such incomplete sweeping may considerably diminish the late-time radio radiation power, irrespective of whether the binary neutron star merger results in the formation of a black hole or a neutron star. Our findings thus imply that the previously reported radio upper limits for certain short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) may not necessarily place stringent constraints on the presence of a long-lived magnetar remnant in these short GRBs.

总结:<br /><br />本文研究了暗物质子暗的影响以及与更为研究的星和黑洞引力透镜现象相比较。研究发现，星团密度梯度和子暗物质子的分布对图像特性起着重要作用，导致在集群的正负奇偶性两侧出现不对称的图像特性。此外，子暗物质子的镜像特征可以在距离巨大集群的临界曲线1″的范围内找到，此外，子暗物质子还会在集群的正奇偶性一侧造成大于0.1等星等的像素级流量变化，并且这些像素往往聚集在（否则看不见的）子暗物质子周围。 <div>
Dark matter subhalos with extended profiles and density cores, and globular star clusters of mass 106–108M⊙ that live near the critical curves in galaxy cluster lenses can potentially be detected through their lensing magnification of stars in background galaxies. In this work, we study the effect such subhalos have on lensed images, and compare to the case of more well-studied microlensing by stars and black holes near critical curves. We find that the cluster density gradient and the extended mass distribution of subhalos are important in determining image properties. Both lead to an asymmetry between the image properties on the positive- and negative-parity sides of the cluster that is more pronounced than in the case of microlensing. For example, on the negative-parity side, subhalos with cores larger than about 50 pc do not generate any images with magnification above ∼100 outside of the immediate vicinity of the cluster critical curve. We discuss these factors using analytical and numerical analysis, and exploit them to identify observable signatures of subhalos: Subhalos create pixel-to-pixel flux variations of ≳0.1 mag on the positive-parity side of clusters. These pixels tend to cluster around (otherwise invisible) subhalos. Unlike in the case of microlensing, signatures of subhalo lensing can be found up to 1″ away from the critical curves of massive clusters.

总结:
太阳活跃区13283在2023年4月21日发生了一次日冕物质抛射，引发了强烈的地磁风暴。研究显示，演化的磁场积聚了螺旋度，同时，辐合和抵消的磁场通量导致了螺旋度注入的改变，导致磁通绳的不稳定性和进一步的喷发。研究进一步表明，日冕物质抛射的形态显示磁通绳顶部出现了高达56°的顺时针旋转。这次日冕物质抛射的分析表明，日冕物质在喷发过程中的旋转是导致强烈地磁风暴的关键因素。通过多仪器、多波长观测和磁场观测，我们能够更好地理解太阳活动对地球的影响。 <br /><br /> <div>
Using multi-instrument and multiwavelength observations, we studied a coronal mass ejection (CME) that led to an intense geomagnetic storm on 2023 April 23. The eruption occurred on April 21 in solar active region (AR) 13283 near the disk center. The AR was in its decay stage, with fragmented polarities and a preexisting long filament channel a few days before the eruption. The study of the magnetic field evolution suggests that the flux rope (filament) was built up by monotonous helicity accumulation over several days, and furthermore, converging and canceling fluxes led to a change in helicity injection, resulting in an unstable nature of the magnetic flux rope (MFR) and its further eruption. Importantly, the CME morphology revealed that the MFR apex underwent a rotation of up to 56° in clockwise direction owing to its positive helicity. The CME decelerates in the field of view (FOV) of the Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph and has a plane-of-sky velocity of 1226 km s−1 at 20 R⊙. In the FOV of the Heliospheric Imager, the lateral expansion of the CME is tracked better than the earthward motion. This implies that the arrival time is difficult to assess. The in situ arrival of the interplanetary CME shock was at 07:30 UT on April 23, and a geomagnetic storm commenced at 08:30 UT. The flux rope fitting to the in situ magnetic field observations reveals that the magnetic cloud flux rope orientation is consistent with its near-Sun orientation, which has a strong negative Bz-component. The analysis of this study indicates that the near-Sun rotation of the filament during its eruption to the CME is the key to the negative Bz-component and consequently the intense geomagnetic storm.

The theoretical oscillation frequencies of even the best asteroseismic models of solar-like oscillators show significant differences from observed oscillation frequencies. Structure inversions seek to use these frequency differences to infer the underlying differences in stellar structure. While used extensively to study the Sun, structure inversion results for other stars have so far been limited. Applying sound speed inversions to more stars allows us to probe stellar theory over a larger range of conditions, as well as look for overall patterns that may hint at deficits in our current understanding. To that end, we present structure inversion results for 12 main-sequence solar-type stars with masses between 1 and 1.15 M⊙. Our inversions are able to infer differences in the isothermal sound speed in the innermost 30% by radius of our target stars. In half of our target stars, the structure of our best-fit model fully agrees with the observations. In the remainder, the inversions reveal significant differences between the sound speed profile of the star and that of the model. We find five stars where the sound speed in the core of our stellar models is too low and one star showing the opposite behavior. For the two stars in which our inversions reveal the most significant differences, we examine whether changing the microphysics of our models improves them and find that changes to nuclear reaction rates or core opacities can reduce, but do not fully resolve, the differences.

<title>Fluid Mixing during Phase Separation in Crystallizing White Dwarfs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Accurate models of cooling white dwarfs must treat the energy released as their cores crystallize. This phase transition slows the cooling by releasing latent heat and also gravitational energy, which results from phase separation: liquid C is released from the solid C/O core, driving an outward carbon flux. The Gaia color–magnitude diagram provides striking confirmation of this theory by revealing a mass-dependent overdensity of white dwarfs, indicating slowed cooling at the expected location. However, the observed overdensity is enhanced relative to the models. Additionally, it is associated with increased magnetism, suggesting a link between crystallization and magnetic field generation. Recent works aimed at explaining an enhanced cooling delay and magnetic field generation employ a uniform mixing prescription that assumes large-scale turbulent motions; we show here that these calculations are not self-consistent. We also show that thermohaline mixing is most likely efficient enough to provide the required chemical redistribution during C/O phase separation, and that the resulting velocities and mixing lengths are much smaller than previous estimates. These reduced fluid motions cannot generate measurable magnetic fields, suggesting any link with crystallization needs to invoke a separate mechanism. Finally, this mixing alters the chemical profiles, which in turn affects the frequencies of the pulsation modes.

<title>The Long-term Spin-down Trend of Ultraluminous X-Ray Pulsar M82 X-2</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The discovery in 2014 of the pulsation from the ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) M82 X-2 has changed our view of ULXs. Because of the relatively short baseline over which pulsations have been detected so far, M82 X-2's spin state had been assumed to be in an equilibrium state. Using Chandra and XMM-Newton archive data, we are able to investigate the pulsation of M82 X-2 back to 2005 and 2001. The newly determined spin frequencies clearly show a long-term spin-down trend. If this trend is caused by magnetic threading, we infer a dipolar magnetic field of ∼1.2 × 1013 G and that a mild beaming factor (∼4) is needed to match the braking torque with the mass accretion torque. On the other hand, there are NuSTAR observations showing instantaneous spin-down behaviors, which might favor a variable prograde/retrograde flow scenario for M82 X-2.

We present a method to estimate the detection expectations of host galaxies of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) in the grizJHKL bands. It is found that given the same limiting magnitude in each band, the z band produces the largest number of overall LGRB hosts and low-mass hosts (M* ≤ 108M⊙) at mag. For the detection of high-redshift LGRB hosts (redshift ≥5), it is recommended to prioritize the L band, due to its good performance at both low and high limiting magnitudes. We specifically estimate the expectation of LGRB host detection with mag, which the James Webb Space Telescope can partially attain. We find that there may exist 116, 259, 277, 439, 266, 294, 274, and 316 LGRB hosts, including 0.54, 31, 28, 143, 12, 20, 14, and 35 low-mass ones in the grizJHKL bands and 13, 14, 15, 14, and 15 high-redshift ones in the zJHKL bands, for 15 yr Swift LGRBs with S ≥ 10−6 erg cm−2. The results show that the study of LGRB hosts under next-generation observational conditions holds significant potential, especially for low-mass host studies. However, it appears that the deeper sensitivities of galaxy telescopes may not significantly enhance statistical studies of high-redshift hosts. Strategies aimed at increasing the number of distant LGRB hosts may require the expansion of high-redshift LGRB detections.

We present a JWST mid-infrared (MIR) spectrum of the underluminous Type Ia Supernova (SN Ia) 2022xkq, obtained with the medium-resolution spectrometer on the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) ∼130 days post-explosion. We identify the first MIR lines beyond 14 μm in SN Ia observations. We find features unique to underluminous SNe Ia, including the following: isolated emission of stable Ni, strong blends of [Ti ii], and large ratios of singly ionized to doubly ionized species in both [Ar] and [Co]. Comparisons to normal-luminosity SNe Ia spectra at similar phases show a tentative trend between the width of the [Co iii] 11.888 μm feature and the SN light-curve shape. Using non-LTE-multi-dimensional radiation hydro simulations and the observed electron capture elements, we constrain the mass of the exploding WD. The best-fitting model shows that SN 2022xkq is consistent with an off-center delayed-detonation explosion of a near-Chandrasekhar mass WD ( ≈1.37 M⊙) of high central density (ρc ≥ 2.0 × 109 g cm−3) seen equator-on, which produced M(56Ni) =0.324 M⊙ and M(58Ni) ≥0.06 M⊙. The observed line widths are consistent with the overall abundance distribution; and the narrow stable Ni lines indicate little to no mixing in the central regions, favoring central ignition of subsonic carbon burning followed by an off-center deflagration-to-detonation transition beginning at a single point. Additional observations may further constrain the physics revealing the presence of additional species including Cr and Mn. Our work demonstrates the power of using the full coverage of MIRI in combination with detailed modeling to elucidate the physics of SNe Ia at a level not previously possible.

The discovery of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in low-mass (M* ≤ 5 × 109 M⊙) galaxies has pushed forward the idea that AGN feedback may play a role in quenching star formation in the low-mass regime. In order to test whether AGNs can be a dominant quenching mechanism, we must first disentangle the effects of internal and external processes caused by a galaxy’s environment. We have used the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory survey to produce resolved Baldwin, Phillips, & Terlevich diagrams, and we find 41 AGNs (∼1.3%) in low-mass galaxies. We have studied the group richness (the number of group members) of our AGN and non-AGN samples as a proxy for determining the possible effect of the environment on the gas reservoir in these galaxies. We find that low-mass galaxies hosting AGNs are more likely to be found in isolation or in low-mass groups than galaxies in the non-AGN samples. This preference is even more clear when we split our samples into star-forming and quiescent subsamples. This suggests that environment is not the main cause of quenching in these galaxies, though we cannot rule out the possibility of past mergers.

总结:<br />
本研究利用卡西尼雷达记录的数据研究了泰坦卫星北极的两个区域，在整个任务结束时，发现尽管夏季到来，但Ligeia Mare的效应温度几乎下降了1K，而固体区域的温度则缓慢上升至2017年增加了1.4±0.3 K。这些观察可以通过春分后泰坦表面和海洋的蒸发冷却来解释。利用海洋环流模型，研究表明海面的冷却应该会引发海洋内部的对流，最终冷却整个被卡西尼辐射计感知的液柱，因此使得即使在蒸发期过去很久之后，深处的温度也会下降。总的来说，这项工作突显了甲烷水文在控制泰坦北极地区表面和水下温度中的关键作用。 <div>
From 2004 to 2017, the Cassini RADAR recorded the 2.2 cm thermal emission from Titan’s surface in its passive (radiometry) mode of operation. We use this data set to investigate the seasonal evolution of the effective temperature sensed by the microwave radiometer in two regions in the northern pole of the satellite: the sea Ligeia Mare, and its nearby solid terrains. We find that despite the arrival of summer at the end of the mission, the effective temperature of Ligeia Mare decreased by almost 1 K, while that of the solid region slowly increased until 2017 by 1.4 ± 0.3 K. These observations, as well as the lag in summer warming observed by Cassini’s Composite Infrared Spectrometer, can be explained by evaporative cooling in both the solid and liquid surfaces after the vernal equinox. It therefore supports the idea that the northern polar terrains are wet. Using an ocean circulation model, we show that the cooling of the sea surface should initiate convection in the sea’s interior, ultimately cooling the whole liquid column sensed by the Cassini radiometer and thus decreasing the temperature at depths even long after the evaporation period has ceased. Overall, this work highlights the key role of methane hydrology in controlling the surface and submarine temperatures in the boreal polar regions of Titan.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了位于银河平面之外的恒星，通过观测SiO masers，揭示了这些恒星的形成历史。共观测了102颗恒星，发现了8颗新的SiO masers。通过测量maser速度，初步估算了宿主AGB星的径向速度。发现其中三颗星的径向速度明显偏离了银河圆形运动的预期值。更新后的距离和3D速度表明，其中一颗位于银河暗盘，一颗可能位于银河薄盘，其余六颗可能属于银河厚盘。 <div>
Studying stars that are located off the Galactic plane is important for understanding the formation history of the Milky Way. We searched for SiO masers toward off-plane O-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars from the catalog presented by Mauron et al. in order to shed light on the origins of these objects. A total of 102 stars were observed in the SiO J = 1−0, v = 1 and 2 transitions with the Effelsberg 100 m and Tianma 65 m telescopes. SiO masers were discovered in eight stars, all first detections. The measured maser velocities allow for initial estimates of the host AGB stars’ radial velocities. We find that the radial velocities of three stars (namely G068.881−24.615, G070.384−24.886, and G084.453−21.863) significantly deviate from the values expected from Galactic circular motion. The updated distances and 3D motions indicate that G068.881−24.615 is likely located in the Galactic halo, while G160.648−08.846 is probably located in the Galactic thin disk, and the other six stars are probably part of the Galactic thick disk.

总结:
中小M型矮星的光谱观测表明，其中7个耀斑显示了清晰的Hα线蓝翼不对称性，耀斑持续时间从20分钟到2.5小时不等，并且也在Hβ线上显示了蓝翼不对称性。某些耀斑还在软X射线光谱中观察到，估算出了耀斑磁场和耀斑环的长度。蓝移组分的视向速度范围从-73到-122 km/s。假设蓝移是由突出体喷发引起的，那么上升等离子体的质量估计在10^15到10^19克之间，大致符合太阳日冕物质喷发（CME）的耀斑能量和喷发质量关系。这些发现暗示了M型矮星上可能存在与太阳喷发相似的加速机制，可能会发展成CME。 <br /><br /> <div>
We conducted the time-resolved simultaneous optical spectroscopic and photometric observations of mid-M-dwarf flare stars YZ CMi, EV Lac, and AD Leo. Spectroscopic observations were obtained using Apache Point Observatory 3.5 m and Small and Moderate Aperture Research Telescope System 1.5 m telescopes during 31 nights. Among the 41 detected flares, seven flares showed clear blue wing asymmetries in the Hα line, with various correspondences in flare properties. The duration of the blue wing asymmetries range from 20 minutes to 2.5 hr, including a flare showing the shift from blue to red wing asymmetry. Blue wing asymmetries can be observed during both white-light and candidate non-white-light flares. All of the seven flares showed blue wing asymmetries also in the Hβ line, but there are large varieties on which other chromospheric lines showed blue wing asymmetries. One among the 7 flares was also observed with soft X-ray spectroscopy, which enabled us to estimate the flare magnetic field and length of the flare loop. The line-of-sight velocities of the blueshifted components range from –73 to –122 km s−1. Assuming that the blueshifts were caused by prominence eruptions, the mass of upward-moving plasma was estimated to be 1015–1019 g, which are roughly on the relation between flare energy and erupting mass expected from solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Although further investigations are necessary for understanding the observed various properties, these possible prominence eruptions on M-dwarfs could evolve into CMEs, assuming the similar acceleration mechanism with solar eruptions.

在研究前主序恒星演化过程中，测量YSO（年轻恒星对象）的性质是关键工具。通过比较观测辐射与现有YSO光谱能量分布（SEDs）计算的模板格点，常用来测量YSO的性质。然而，目前我们还没有完整的星际形成理论。本文呈现了无假设演化理论的新版Robitaille YSO SEDs模型集合，可用于更广泛的理论评估。我们还计算了包层质量、加权平均尘埃温度、盘稳定性和星周AV，并将SEDs与新的滤波器进行卷积。我们发现了模型中平均温度与微米波长亮度之间的相关性，并讨论了对前主序和原恒星核的质量测量的影响。此外，我们比较了不同观测类别和演化阶段YSO在红外颜色空间中的位置，并使用我们的模型量化了由于观测效应可能引起的类别和阶段混淆程度。我们向公众发布了更新的模型。 <br /><br />总结: 研究了测量YSO性质的方法，提出了新版无假设演化理论的YSO SEDs模型集合，计算了多个性质并与新的滤波器进行卷积。发现了模型中的关联性，并比较了不同YSO在红外色彩空间的位置。 <div>
Measured properties of young stellar objects (YSOs) are key tools for research into pre-main-sequence stellar evolution. YSO properties are commonly measured by comparing observed radiation to existing grids of template YSO spectral energy distributions (SEDs) calculated by radiative transfer. These grids are often sampled and constructed using simple models of mass assembly/accretion over time. However, because we do not yet have a complete theory of star formation, the choice of model sets the tracked parameters and range of allowed values. By construction, then, the assumed model limits the measurements that can be made using the grid. Radiative transfer models not constrained by specific accretion histories would enable assessment of a wider range of theories. We present an updated version of the Robitaille set (2017) of YSO SEDs, a collection of models with no assumed evolutionary theory. We outline our newly calculated properties: envelope mass, weighted-average dust temperature, disk stability, and circumstellar AV. We also convolve the SEDs with new filters, including JWST, and provide users the ability to perform additional convolutions. We find a correlation between the average temperature and millimeter-wavelength brightness of optically thin dust in our models and discuss its ramifications for mass measurements of pre- and protostellar cores. We also compare the positions of YSOs of different observational classes and evolutionary stages in IR color space and use our models to quantify the extent to which class and stage may be confused due to observational effects. Our updated models are released to the public.

这篇文章报告了使用SPHYNX和FLASH两种模拟代码对旋转20M⊙原恒星的三维恒星核心坍缩超新星模拟的研究。研究发现在跳跃后的第一个100毫秒内，出现两个重要的引力波信号，频率分别约为300赫兹和1.3千赫。这两个特征与来自原恒星变形的m = 1调制有关，该调制由低T/∣W∣不稳定引起。根据观察结果，300赫兹特征在初始角速度为1.0至4.0弧度每秒的模型中存在，而1.3千赫特征仅出现在1.5至3.5弧度每秒的更窄范围内。研究还观察到一个较弱但显著的更高阶模式的引力波特征，其初始峰频约为800赫兹，并逐渐增加至900-1000赫兹。因此，除了引力反弹信号外，检测300赫兹、1.3千赫以及更高阶模式，甚至相关的中微子的不对称发射，可以提供额外的诊断信息来估计坍缩核的初始角速度。<br /><br />总结: <br />核心坍缩超新星模拟产生了约300赫兹和1.3千赫的重要引力波特征，这与m = 1变形和低T/∣W∣不稳定有关。此外，还观察到了更高阶模式的引力波特征。这些结果为估计坍缩核的初始角速度提供了额外的诊断信息。 <div>
We present self-consistent three-dimensional core-collapse supernova simulations of a rotating 20M⊙ progenitor model with various initial angular velocities from 0.0 to 4.0 rad s−1 using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code SPHYNX and the grid-based hydrodynamics code FLASH. We identify two strong gravitational-wave features with peak frequencies of ∼300 Hz and ∼1.3 kHz in the first 100 ms postbounce. We demonstrate that these two features are associated with the m = 1 deformation from the proto-neutron star (PNS) modulation induced by the low-T/∣W∣ instability, regardless of the simulation code. The 300 Hz feature is present in models with an initial angular velocity between 1.0 and 4.0 rad s−1, while the 1.3 kHz feature is only present in a narrower range, from 1.5 to 3.5 rad s−1. We show that the 1.3 kHz signal originates from the high-density inner core of the PNS, and the m = 1 deformation triggers a strong asymmetric distribution of electron antineutrinos. In addition to the 300 Hz and 1.3 kHz features, we also observe one weaker but noticeable gravitational-wave feature from higher-order modes in the range between 1.5 and 3.5 rad s−1. Its initial peak frequency is around 800 Hz, and it gradually increases to 900–1000 Hz. Therefore, in addition to the gravitational bounce signal, the detection of the 300 Hz, 1.3 kHz, the higher-order mode, and even the related asymmetric emission of neutrinos could provide additional diagnostics for estimating the initial angular velocity of a collapsing core.

<title>Precision MARS Mass Reconstruction of A2744: Synergizing the Largest Strong-lensing and Densest Weak-lensing Data Sets from JWST</title>

总结:
A2744是一个由JWST提供数据支持的高分辨率自由形式质量模型。该模型结合了弱引力透镜和强引力透镜数据集，创造了迄今为止单个星团最严格的强引力透镜约束，同时也是迄今为止密度最高的弱引力透镜约束。质量重建显示出一个等腰三角形结构，完美地跟踪了最亮的星团星系。通过MARS算法，我们的质量模型显示出更低的多重像散射参数，远远低于以前的研究。我们还公开了质量和放大地图。 <div>
We present a new high-resolution free-form mass model of A2744 that combines both weak-lensing (WL) and strong-lensing (SL) data sets from JWST. The SL data set comprises 286 multiple images, presenting the most extensive SL constraint to date for a single cluster. The WL data set, employing photo-z selection, yields a source density of , marking the densest WL constraint ever. The combined mass reconstruction enables the highest-resolution mass map of A2744 within the ∼1.8 Mpc × 1.8 Mpc reconstruction region to date, revealing an isosceles triangular structure with two legs of ∼1 Mpc and a base of ∼0.6 Mpc. Although our algorithm, which is called MAximum-entropy ReconStruction (MARS), is entirely blind to the cluster galaxy distribution, the resulting mass reconstruction traces the brightest cluster galaxies remarkably well. The five strongest mass peaks coincide with the five most luminous cluster galaxies within ≲2″. We do not detect any unusual mass peaks that are not traced by the cluster galaxies, unlike the findings in previous studies. Our mass model shows the smallest scatter of SL multiple images in both source (∼0.″05) and image (∼0.″1) planes, which is lower than in previous studies by a factor of ∼4. Although MARS represents the mass field with an extremely large number of free parameters (∼300,000), it converges to a solution within a few hours because we use a deep-learning technique. We make our mass and magnification maps publicly available.

这篇文章分析了102个Ia型超新星（SNe Ia），这是迄今为止最大的样本，主要基于来自ZTF和ATLAS的归档数据。研究将SNe Ia分为内部集群样本和外部集群样本，并与类似红移的 quiescent 和 star-forming 宿主星系的场样本进行比较。研究发现，内部集群的SNe Ia有更高比例的快速演化天体（SALT3 x1 <−1），这意味着内部集群环境中存在一种本质上不同的SNe Ia种群。研究还表明，集群样本显示了明显的双峰x1分布，快速演化的天体在内部集群中占主导地位，而在星形成星系中占较小比例。此外，研究发现了宇宙膨胀的残差中SN Ia标准化参数的微小差异。研究建议星体群的年龄驱使了所观察的分布，年龄最大的星体群几乎完全产生了快速演化的SNe Ia。
<br /><br />总结: 我们分析了102个近邻（z<0.1）x射线选择的星系团中的SNe Ia。内部星系团样本中的SNe Ia具有更高比例的快速演化天体，并且集群样本显示出明显的双峰x1分布。此外，我们观察到了在SNe Ia标准化参数和宇宙膨胀的残差中的微小差异。我们的研究表明，星体群的年龄可能驱使了所观察到的分布。 <div>
We present an analysis of 102 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in nearby (z < 0.1), x-ray-selected galaxy clusters. This is the largest such sample to date and is based on archival data primarily from ZTF and ATLAS. We divide our SNe Ia into an inner cluster sample projected within r500 of the cluster center and an outer cluster sample projected between r500 and 2 r500. We compare these to field samples of SNe Ia at similar redshifts in both quiescent and star-forming host galaxies. Based on SALT3 fits to the light curves, we find that the inner cluster SNe Ia have a higher fraction of fast-evolving objects (SALT3 x1 < −1) than the outer cluster or field quiescent samples. This implies an intrinsically different population of SNe Ia occurs in inner cluster environments, beyond known correlations based on host galaxy alone. Our cluster samples show a strongly bimodal x1 distribution with a fast-evolving component that dominates the inner cluster objects (≳75%) but is just a small fraction of SNe Ia in field star-forming galaxies (≲10%). We do not see strong evidence for variations in the color (SALT3 c) distributions among the samples and find only minor differences in SN Ia standardization parameters and Hubble residuals. We suggest that the age of the stellar population drives the observed distributions, with the oldest populations nearly exclusively producing fast-evolving SNe Ia.

总结: <br />
最近，在银河系中心的分子云中探测到了顺式-反式碳酸，表明更稳定但目前尚未观测到的顺式-顺式构型在红外特征上有较强的特点。虽然能量较高的顺式-反式碳酸已经在毫米和厘米波长被探测到，由于其较大的偶极矩，但顺式-顺式碳酸的振动结构更适合在微米波长观测到。两种构型的红外强度都较大，并且其中一些特征落在不被多环芳烃主导的区域。水特征可能会阻碍在2.75μm的氢化物拉伸附近的观测，但在5.5-6.0μm范围内的其他振动基频甚至倍频可能通过JWST数据被识别。这项研究利用高水平和准确基准的量子化学非谐程序计算了与实验相比异常精确的旋转光谱数据。这种性能意味着在该研究中计算的红外吸收甚至级联发射光谱特征应该是准确的，并将为各种天文环境中对碳酸酸构型的观测提供所需的参考。 <div>
With the recent radioastronomical detection of cis-trans-carbonic acid (H2CO3) in a molecular cloud toward the Galactic center, the more stable but currently unobserved cis-cis conformer is shown here to have strong IR features. While the higher-energy cis-trans-carbonic acid was detected at millimeter and centimeter wavelengths, owing to its larger dipole moment, the vibrational structure of cis-cis-carbonic acid is more amenable to its observation at micron wavelengths. Even so, both conformers have relatively large IR intensities, and some of these fall in regions not dominated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Water features may inhibit observation near the 2.75 μm hydride stretches, but other vibrational fundamentals and even overtones in the 5.5–6.0 μm range may be discernible with JWST data. This work has employed high-level, accurately benchmarked quantum chemical anharmonic procedures to compute exceptionally accurate rotational spectroscopic data compared to experiment. Such performance implies that the IR absorption and even cascade emission spectral features computed in this work should be accurate and will provide the needed reference for observation of either carbonic acid conformer in various astronomical environments.

We report the finding of a new, local diffusion instability in a protoplanetary disk which can operate in a dust fluid, subject to mass diffusion, shear viscosity, and dust–gas drag, provided the diffusivity, viscosity, or both, decrease sufficiently rapidly with increasing dust surface mass density. We devise a vertically averaged, axisymmetric hydrodynamic model to describe a dense, midplane dust layer in a protoplanetary disk. The gas is modeled as a passive component, imposing an effective, diffusion-dependent pressure, mass diffusivity, and viscosity onto the otherwise collisionless dust fluid, via turbulence excited by the gas alone, or dust and gas in combination. In particular, we argue that such conditions are met when the dust–gas mixture generates small-scale turbulence through the streaming instability, as supported by recent measurements of dust mass diffusion slopes in simulations. We hypothesize that the newly discovered instability may be the origin of filamentary features, almost ubiquitously found in simulations of the streaming instability. In addition, our model allows for growing oscillatory modes, which operate in a similar fashion as the axisymmetric viscous overstability in dense planetary rings. However, it remains speculative if the required conditions for such modes can be met in protoplanetary disks.

<title>What is the Reynolds Number of the Solar Wind?</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad118e</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad118e</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Reynolds number, Re, is an important quantity for describing a turbulent flow. It tells us about the bandwidth over which energy can cascade from large scales to smaller ones, prior to the onset of dissipation. However, calculating it for nearly collisionless plasmas like the solar wind is challenging. Previous studies have used formulations of an “effective” Reynolds number, expressing Re as a function of the correlation scale and either the Taylor scale or a proxy for the dissipation scale. We find that the Taylor scale definition of the Reynolds number has a sizable prefactor of approximately 27, which has not been employed in previous works. Drawing from 18 years of data from the Wind spacecraft at 1 au, we calculate the magnetic Taylor scale directly and use both the ion inertial length and the magnetic spectrum break scale as approximations for the dissipation scale, yielding three distinct Re estimates for each 12 hr interval. Average values of Re range between 116,000 and 3,406,000 within the general distribution of past work. We also find considerable disagreement between the methods, with linear associations of between 0.38 and 0.72. Although the Taylor scale method is arguably more physically motivated, due to its dependence on the energy cascade rate, more theoretical work is needed in order to identify the most appropriate way of calculating effective Reynolds numbers for kinetic plasmas. As a summary of our observational analysis, we make available a data product of 28 years of 1 au solar wind and magnetospheric plasma measurements from Wind.

<title>Gas Morphology of Milky Way–like Galaxies in the TNG50 Simulation: Signals of Twisting and Stretching</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present an in-depth analysis of gas morphologies for a sample of 25 Milky Way–like galaxies from the IllustrisTNG TNG50 simulation. We constrain the morphology of cold, warm, hot gas, and gas particles as a whole using a local shell iterative method and explore its observational implications by computing the hard-to-soft X-ray ratio, which ranges between 10−3 and 10−2 in the inner ∼50 kpc of the distribution and 10−5–10−4 at the outer portion of the hot gas distribution. We group galaxies into three main categories: simple, stretched, and twisted. These categories are based on the radial reorientation of the principal axes of the reduced inertia tensor. We find that a vast majority (77%) of the galaxies in our sample exhibit twisting patterns in their radial profiles. Additionally, we present detailed comparisons between (i) the gaseous distributions belonging to individual temperature regimes, (ii) the cold gas distributions and stellar distributions, and (iii) the gaseous distributions and dark matter (DM) halos. We find a strong correlation between the morphological properties of the cold gas and stellar distributions. Furthermore, we find a correlation between gaseous distributions with a DM halo that increases with gas temperature, implying that we may use the warm–hot gaseous morphology as a tracer to probe the DM morphology. Finally, we show gaseous distributions exhibit significantly more prolate morphologies than the stellar distributions and DM halos, which we hypothesize is due to stellar and active galactic nucleus feedback.

<title>Can Emission Measure Distributions Derived from Extreme-ultraviolet Images Accurately Constrain High-temperature Plasma?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Measuring the relative amount of high-temperature, low emission measure (EM) plasma is considered to be a smoking-gun observation to constrain the frequency of plasma heating in coronal structures. Often, narrowband, extreme-ultraviolet images, such as those obtained by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), are used to determine the EM distribution, though the sensitivity to high-temperature plasma is limited. Conversely, the soft X-ray wavelength range offers multiple high-temperature diagnostics, including emission lines of N vii, O vii, O viii, Fe xvii, Ne ix, and Mg xi, which can provide tight constraints to the high-temperature plasma in the log T = 6.1–6.7 (∼1–5+ MK) range. The Marshall Grazing Incidence X-ray Spectrometer (MaGIXS), a slitless spectrograph launched on a NASA sounding rocket on 2021 July 30, resolved an X-ray-bright point in multiple emission lines in the soft X-ray wavelength range. Using coordinated observations of the same X-ray-bright point from SDO/AIA, we compare and contrast the EM distributions from the EUV image data, the X-ray spectra, and the combined EUV and X-ray data set. In this paper, we demonstrate that EM distributions from SDO/AIA data alone can overestimate the amount of high-temperature (log T > 6.4) plasma in the solar corona by a factor of 3–15. Furthermore, we present our effort to cross-calibrate Hinode/X-ray Telescope (XRT) response functions by comparing the observed XRT fluxes with the predicted ones from combined MaGIXS-1 + AIA EM analysis.

One of the primary outstanding questions in extragalactic astronomy is the formation and early evolution of the supermassive black holes that are seen in nearly every massive galaxy. Low-metallicity dwarf galaxies may offer the most representative local analogs to pristine early galaxies, making them a vital tool in probing black hole seed models through the study of the intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) possibly hosted therein; though these dwarf galaxies, and the IMBHs they may host, are typically not as well-studied in this context as their higher-metallicity and higher-mass counterparts. In this paper, we explore the X-ray properties of a sample of 37 low-metallicity dwarf galaxies using archival XMM observations, and we compare the properties of this population against a representative sample of higher-metallicity counterparts. We report the detection of 10 sources with 0.3–10 keV luminosity in excess of 1040 erg s−1 within the low-metallicity sample, which we highlight for followup as potential IMBH candidates. Finally, we discuss the differing multiwavelength scaling relations (e.g., LX–LW2, LX–star formation rate) between the two galaxy populations, as well as the sample’s LX as a function of metallicity.

这项研究使用了更新和显著增加的Cepheid和TRGB距离样本，覆盖了大范围的金属丰度，并搜索了Cepheid脉动变星振幅与H ii区域金属丰度之间的相关性。研究表明，Cepheid和TRGB距离刻度的零点非常吻合，并且在较近距离选择样本中几乎为零。然而，在较远的样本中，两个距离刻度之间存在更大的偏移。研究还发现，使用除去红化的W(V,VI)周期-光度关系时，Cepheid距离刻度没有显著的金属丰度依赖性。 <div>
Using an updated and significantly augmented sample of Cepheid and tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distances to 28 nearby spiral and irregular galaxies, covering a wide range of metallicities, we have searched for evidence of a correlation of the zero-point of the Cepheid period–luminosity relation with H ii region (gas-phase) metallicities. Our analysis, for the 21 galaxies closer than 12.5 Mpc, results in the following conclusions: (1) The zero-points of the Cepheid and TRGB distance scales are in remarkably good agreement, with the mean offset in the zero-points of the most nearby distance-selected sample being close to zero, Δμo(Cepheid—TRGB) = −0.026 ± 0.015 mag (for an I-band TRGB zero-point of MI = −4.05 mag); however, for the more distant sample, there is a larger offset between the two distance scales, amounting to −0.073 ± 0.057 mag 〈Δμo〉 (Cepheids—TRGB) = −0.026 ± 0.015 mag, for an I-band TRGB zero-point of MI = −4.05 mag. (2) The individual differences, about that mean, have a measured scatter of ±0.068 mag. (3) We find no statistically significant evidence for a metallicity dependence in the Cepheid distance scale using the reddening-free W(V, VI) period–luminosity relation: Δμo(Cepheid − TRGB) = − 0.022( ± 0.015) × ([O/H] − 8.50) − 0.003(±0.007).

总结: 本研究利用贝叶斯框架处理引力微透镜数据，推断黑洞的类型和贡献，尤其对于平均质量为30M⊙的原始黑洞群体有较好效果。该方法能够在不确定的情况下对群体特征进行推测，成为了当前光度微透镜调查中提取原始黑洞丰度约为25%的领先方法。但在模拟中发现，难以推断恒星起源黑洞的质量下限，这对了解黑洞质量间隔的重要观测结果产生了挑战。这项工作为从当前光度微透镜调查中提取尖端原始黑洞丰度约束奠定了基础。 <br /><br /> <div>
From the formation mechanisms of stars and compact objects to nuclear physics, modern astronomy frequently leverages surveys to understand populations of objects to answer fundamental questions. The population of dark and isolated compact objects in the Galaxy contains critical information related to many of these topics, but is only practically accessible via gravitational microlensing. However, photometric microlensing observables are degenerate for different types of lenses, and one can seldom classify an event as involving either a compact object or stellar lens on its own. To address this difficulty, we apply a Bayesian framework that treats lens type probabilistically and jointly with a lens population model. This method allows lens population characteristics to be inferred despite intrinsic uncertainty in the lens class of any single event. We investigate this method’s effectiveness on a simulated ground-based photometric survey in the context of characterizing a hypothetical population of primordial black holes (PBHs) with an average mass of 30M⊙. On simulated data, our method outperforms current black hole (BH) lens identification pipelines and characterizes different subpopulations of lenses while jointly constraining the PBH contribution to dark matter to ≈25%. Key to robust inference, our method can marginalize over population model uncertainty. We find the lower mass cutoff for stellar origin BHs, a key observable in understanding the BH mass gap, particularly difficult to infer in our simulations. This work lays the foundation for cutting-edge PBH abundance constraints to be extracted from current photometric microlensing surveys.

通过对CHIME/FRB重复观测源和三个光度星系调查的样本进行角度交叉相关性分析，结果显示当FRB的外星系色散度测量值大于395 pc cm^−3时，与红移z>0.275的WISE × SCOS星系呈现出显著的相关性。这种相关性源自于FRB 20200320A与相同暗物质暗物质红移z≈0.32的星系团之间的统计联系。研究结果强烈提示将星系团和星系群目录纳入直接主机关联管线中，以有效利用双点信息来约束FRB的性质，比如它们的红移和DM分布。此外，还发现重复FRB样本与DESI-LRG星系在红移0.3 ≤ z < 0.45范围内呈现出99.4%的置信度下的负相关性，这表明与表观非重复源相比，重复源可能更容易受到自由电子的传播效应的影响。 <br /><br />总结: <br />文章研究了CHIME/FRB重复观测源与星系的相关性，发现当FRB的外星系色散度测量值大于395 pc cm^−3时，与红移z>0.275的WISE × SCOS星系呈现出显著的相关性。此外，还发现重复FRB样本与DESI-LRG星系在红移0.3 ≤ z < 0.45范围内呈现出负相关性。对研究FRB性质和星系关联提供了重要的启示。 <div>
We present results from angular cross correlations between select samples of CHIME/FRB repeaters and galaxies in three photometric galaxy surveys, which have shown correlations with the first CHIME/FRB catalog containing repeating and nonrepeating sources: Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) × SCOS, DESI-BGS, and DESI-LRG. We find a statistically significant correlation (p-value &lt;0.001, after accounting for look-elsewhere factors) between a sample of repeaters with an extragalactic dispersion measure (DM) &gt; 395 pc cm−3 and WISE × SCOS galaxies with redshift z &gt; 0.275. We demonstrate that the correlation arises surprisingly because of a statistical association between FRB 20200320A (extragalactic DM ≈ 550 pc cm−3) and a galaxy group in the same dark matter halo at redshift z ≈ 0.32. We estimate that the host halo, along with an intervening halo at redshift z ≈ 0.12, accounts for at least ∼30% of the extragalactic DM. Our results strongly motivate incorporating galaxy group and cluster catalogs into direct host association pipelines for FRBs with \lesssim 1^{\prime} localization precision, effectively utilizing the two-point information to constrain FRB properties such as their redshift and DM distributions. In addition, we find marginal evidence for a negative correlation at 99.4% confidence limit between a sample of repeating FRBs with baseband data (median extragalactic DM = 354 pc cm−3) and DESI-LRG galaxies with redshift 0.3 ≤ z &lt; 0.45, suggesting that the repeaters might be more prone than apparent nonrepeaters to propagation effects in FRB–galaxy correlations due to intervening free electrons over angular scales ∼0.°5.

<div> GRB, kilonova, threat, off-axis observers, multi-messenger observations
<br /><br />总结: 本研究基于GW170817/GRB 170817A多信使事件的观测和理论预测，探讨了双中子星合并产生的高能辐射对近处观测者的潜在威胁。研究发现，基准KNe参数下，余辉的X射线辐射可能对约1pc范围内的观测者构成致命威胁，而辐射观测者的伽马射线辐射可能对约4pc范围内的观测者构成威胁，而最大的威胁来自余辉爆炸产生的宇宙射线，可以对约11pc范围内的观测者构成致命威胁。KNe的威胁距离与超新星类似，但发生频率远低。然而，本研究依赖于有限的KNe数据，多信使观测将澄清这类事件可能带来的威胁。 <div>
Binary neutron star mergers produce high-energy emissions from several physically different sources, including a gamma-ray burst (GRB) and its afterglow, a kilonova (KN), and, at late times, a remnant many parsecs in size. Ionizing radiation from these sources can be dangerous for life on Earth-like planets when located too close. Work to date has explored the substantial danger posed by the GRB to on-axis observers; here we focus instead on the potential threats posed to nearby off-axis observers. Our analysis is based largely on observations of the GW170817/GRB 170817A multi-messenger event, as well as theoretical predictions. For baseline KN parameters, we find that the X-ray emission from the afterglow may be lethal out to ∼1 pc and the off-axis gamma-ray emission may threaten a range out to ∼4 pc, whereas the greatest threat comes years after the explosion, from the cosmic rays accelerated by the KN blast, which can be lethal out to distances up to ∼11 pc. The distances quoted here are typical, but the values have significant uncertainties and depend on the viewing angle, ejected mass, and explosion energy in ways we quantify. Assessing the overall threat to Earth-like planets, KNe have a similar kill distance to supernovae, but are far less common. However, our results rely on the scant available KN data, and multi-messenger observations will clarify the danger posed by such events.

<div> BL Lac S5 0716+714, Yunnan Observatory, optical data, quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO), helical motion

总结:<br /><br />
从2017年11月10日到2018年5月15日，利用云南天文台的60厘米望远镜收集了BL Lac S5 0716+714的光学数据，包括g、r和i波段的21396个准同步多波段观测点。通过朗伯-斯卡格尔周期图法和加权小波Z变换法，首次发现了一个周期为44±6天的QPO信号，最终显著性为3.98σ。进一步分析表明，44天QPO信号可能是由喷流中速度为β的斑点的螺旋运动引起的，喷流中发射区域的视角经历周期性变化。此外，利用假设检验方法分析了流量分布，并确定双对数正态分布更适合；因此，在这个源中可能存在两个辐射迷你区域，因此这个44天的QPO信号可能叠加在更长期的突发之上。 <div>
By means of astronomical observation data from the 60 cm Telescope at Yunnan Observatory, optical data in the g, r, and i bands were collected for BL Lac S5 0716+714, spanning from 2017 November 10 to 2018 May 15. The original data set contains 21,396 quasi-simultaneous multiband points, with 7132 data points for each band. The Lomb–Scargle periodogram method and the weighted wavelet Z-transform method were used to search for a quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) signal in the data. For the first time, we report a QPO signal at 44 ± 6 days with a final significance of 3.98σ. Further analysis of the spectrum index reveals that the 44 day QPO signal is most likely explained by a helical motion of a blob with velocity β in the jet, where the viewing angle of the emission region in the jet undergoes periodic variations. In addition, we employed the hypothesis testing method (the null hypothesis) to analyze the flux distribution and determined that a double log-normal distribution provides a better fit; thus, there may be two radiative mini-regions within a jet in this source, so this 44 day QPO signal may be superimposed on a longer-term outburst.

<div> H ii region, multiwavelength, YSO, extinction, star formation
总结:
Sh2-87 H ii region的研究使用了光学到射电波段的多波段数据集。通过Herschel柱密度图和近红外光度数据生成的消光图，揭示了云的丝状结构和非均匀分布。在该区域鉴定出13个I类和202个II类年轻恒星对象（YSOs），以及22个Hα发射源。进一步分析表明，该星团主要由典型年龄约3百万年、质量在0.1-6.0太阳质量范围内的低质量YSOs组成。发现进化型YSOs主要分布在丝状结构和云的外部，而近期的星形成活动主要集中在中心区域的离子化气体和星形成团块中。Sh2-87区域的整体星形成情景与全局分级坍缩模型相似，年轻的大质量恒星形成活动预期在中心核心区域，同时在丝状结构和云的外部分布着进化型低质量YSOs。 <div>
We present a detailed study of the Sh2-87 H ii region using a multiwavelength data set in optical to radio bands. A Herschel column density map revealed that the host cloud is filamentary in nature, and together they formed a central dense hub. The extinction map generated using near-infrared photometric data also signifies the nonuniform distribution of the cloud and reveals its filamentary nature. We estimated a sizable variable extinction over the region up to AV = 34.4 mag, with an average value of AV = 3.4 mag. Using the various infrared color–color criteria, we identified 13 Class I and 202 Class II young stellar objects (YSOs) and 22 Hα-emitting sources toward this region. Further analysis showed that the cluster is mainly composed of low-mass YSOs with a typical age of ∼3 Myr having masses in the range of 0.1–6.0 M⊙. The identified evolved YSOs (i.e., Class II YSOs) are primarily distributed along the filaments and in the outer parts of the cloud, while the recent star formation, inferred by the presence of Class I YSOs, ionized gas, and star-forming clumps, is observed in the hub region. The overall star formation scenario in the Sh2-87 region resembles the global hierarchical collapse model of star formation, where younger massive star formation activity is expected at the central hub along with the distribution of evolved low-mass YSOs in the filaments and the outer parts of the cloud.

<br />
研究团队在澳大利亚平方公里阵列探路者变量和慢变源调查中发现了一个年轻的、高度分散的脉冲星。通过对Parkes射电望远镜进行跟踪观测，他们确定了PSR J1032−5804，测得其周期为78.7毫秒，离散度测量为819 ± 4 pc cm−3，旋转度测量为−2000 ± 1 rad m−2，特征年龄为34.6千年。该脉冲星在3 GHz的脉冲散射时间尺度约为22毫秒，暗示其在1 GHz的时间尺度约为3845毫秒，这使得其成为已知的第三个最分散的脉冲星，解释了其在先前的脉冲星调查中未被检测到的原因。研究团队通过分析脉冲星的频谱能量分布以及多波段图像中的周围延伸辐射，发现了可能存在的脉冲星风星云和超新星遗迹。这些结果突显了从射电连续图像中识别极端分散脉冲星的可能性。持续进行的大规模射电连续巡天将为我们提供一个前所未有的机会，发现更多极端脉冲星（例如高度分散、高度间歇和高度加速），从而增进我们对脉冲星和星际介质特性的理解。
<br /><br />总结: 高度分散脉冲星的发现； Parkes射电望远镜的跟踪观测结果； 脉冲星的特征参数和脉冲散射时间尺度的测算； 脉冲星风星云和超新星遗迹的可能发现； 未来射电连续巡天将促进对极端脉冲星的发现。 <div>
We report the discovery of a young, highly scattered pulsar in a search for highly circularly polarized radio sources as part of the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder Variables and Slow Transients survey. In follow-up observations with the Parkes radio telescope, Murriyang, we identified PSR J1032−5804 and measured a period of 78.7 ms, a dispersion measure of 819 ± 4 pc cm−3, a rotation measure of −2000 ± 1  rad m−2, and a characteristic age of 34.6 kyr. We found a pulse scattering timescale at 3 GHz of ∼22 ms, implying a timescale at 1 GHz of ∼3845 ms, which is the third most scattered pulsar known and explains its nondetection in previous pulsar surveys. We discuss the identification of a possible pulsar wind nebula and supernova remnant in the pulsar’s local environment by analyzing the pulsar spectral energy distribution and the surrounding extended emission from multiwavelength images. Our result highlights the possibility of identifying extremely scattered pulsars from radio continuum images. Ongoing and future large-scale radio continuum surveys will offer us an unprecedented opportunity to find more extreme pulsars (e.g., highly scattered, highly intermittent, and highly accelerated), which will enhance our understanding of the characteristics of pulsars and the interstellar medium.

总结:<br /><br />
这篇文章报告了在G165星系团中发现的一个红移为1.78的Type Ia超新星。通过引力透镜效应，该超新星在三个不同的位置上出现。研究团队利用这个多重成像的超新星测定了哈勃常数。通过对星系团的成像，确定了21个成像倍增性，并用近红外光谱仪确认了其中五个。研究团队构建了一个新的透镜模型，估计星系团600kpc范围内的总质量为(2.6 ± 0.3) × 10^14太阳质量。此外，他们发现了一个与超新星宿主星系重叠的星系密度过剩。近红外光谱还确认了六个成员星系，其中四个环绕着超新星宿主星系。最后，研究团队还发现了另一个以一个强烈透镜效应为中心的星系群，估计其总恒星形成率为每年100个太阳质量。这暗示了对该星系团进行定期监测可能会发现更多的超新星。 <div>
A Type Ia supernova (SN) at z = 1.78 was discovered in James Webb Space Telescope Near Infrared Camera imaging of the galaxy cluster PLCK G165.7+67.0 (G165; z = 0.35). The SN is situated 1.5–2 kpc from the host-galaxy nucleus and appears in three different locations as a result of gravitational lensing by G165. These data can yield a value for Hubble’s constant using time delays from this multiply imaged SN Ia that we call “SN H0pe.” Over the cluster, we identified 21 image multiplicities, confirmed five of them using the Near-Infrared Spectrograph, and constructed a new lens model that gives a total mass within 600 kpc of (2.6 ± 0.3) × 1014M⊙. The photometry uncovered a galaxy overdensity coincident with the SN host galaxy. NIRSpec confirmed six member galaxies, four of which surround the SN host galaxy with relative velocity ≲900 km s−1 and projected physical extent ≲33 kpc. This compact galaxy group is dominated by the SN host galaxy, which has a stellar mass of (5.0 ± 0.1) × 1011M⊙. The group members have specific star formation rates of 2–260 Gyr−1 derived from the Hα-line fluxes corrected for stellar absorption, dust extinction, and slit losses. Another group centered on a strongly lensed dusty star-forming galaxy is at z = 2.24. The total (unobscured and obscured) SFR of this second galaxy group is estimated to be (≳ 100 M⊙ yr−1), which translates to a supernova rate of ∼1 SNe yr−1, suggesting that regular monitoring of this cluster may yield additional SNe.

SLSNe的研究利用哈勃空间望远镜进行了UV成像，发现SLSNe的偏移距离大部分符合指数分布，但偏移较大的情况较为突出。SLSNe偏移距离显著大于长软伽马射线暴(LGRBs)，甚至大于Ib/c型和II型超新星。此外，约37%的SLSNe发生在宿主星系最暗淡的区域，这与LGRBs和Ib/c型以及II型超新星形成鲜明对比。研究还发现，SLSNe的位置与红移、爆发和磁星发动机参数没有显著关系，这表明它们的前体星可能遵循不同的演化路径。研究者推测，SLSNe可能源于被破碎的双星系统抛射出的高速大质量恒星。 <br /><br />总结: SLSNe的研究表明它们的位置分布与其他超新星和伽马射线暴存在显著差异，推测其前体星可能来自被破碎的双星系统抛射出的高速大质量恒星。 <div>
We present an extensive Hubble Space Telescope rest-frame UV imaging study of the locations of Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) within their host galaxies. The sample includes 65 SLSNe with detected host galaxies in the redshift range z ≈ 0.05–2. Using precise astrometric matching with SN images, we determine the distributions of the physical and host-normalized offsets relative to the host centers, as well as the fractional flux distribution relative to the underlying UV light distributions. We find that the host-normalized offsets of SLSNe roughly track an exponential disk profile, but exhibit an overabundance of sources with large offsets of 1.5–4 times their hosts' half-light radii. The SLSNe normalized offsets are systematically larger than those of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), and even Type Ib/c and Type II SNe. Furthermore, we find from a Monte Carlo procedure that about {37}_{-8}^{+6} \% of SLSNe occur in the dimmest regions of their host galaxies, with a median fractional flux value of 0.16, in stark contrast to LGRBs and Type Ib/c and Type II SNe. We do not detect any significant trends in the locations of SLSNe as a function of redshift, or as a function of explosion and magnetar engine parameters inferred from modeling of their optical light curves. The significant difference in SLSN locations compared to LGRBs (and normal core-collapse SNe) suggests that at least some of their progenitors follow a different evolutionary path. We speculate that SLSNe arise from massive runaway stars from disrupted binary systems, with velocities of ∼102 km s−1.

总结:
θ Mus是一个引人注目的光谱双星系统，由碳型Wolf–Rayet恒星和OV伴星组成，在约19天的轨道上运转。它还包括一个O-超巨星，如果与双星系统有引力约束，将具有数十年的轨道周期。θ Mus的X射线亮度高，是一个非热无线电源，与大质量碰撞风双星常见的现象相符。新的Chandra X射线观测发现，θ Mus的X射线辐射包括一个冷却的几乎稳定的、受吸收影响较小的等离子体成分，其延伸范围远离双星系统。还存在由Fe xxv辐射示踪的较热等离子体。在≈2-5 keV范围内观察到的通量在≤5年的时间尺度内显着下降。这种通量下降可以归因于对较热等离子体的吸收增加，后者可能位于短周期双星系统的受限风相互作用区域内。θ Mus的X射线辐射与WC+O双星γ2 Vel的类似，包括碳复合谱线，但是这两个系统都显示出挑战CW模型的异常线中心性质。 <div>
θ Mus is a remarkable spectroscopic binary (SB) consisting of a carbon-type Wolf–Rayet star and OV companion (WC6+O6–7V) in a ≈19 days orbit. In addition an O-supergiant is visually detected at a small offset of 46 mas and if gravitationally bound to the SB system would have an orbital period of many decades. θ Mus is X-ray bright and a nonthermal radio source as commonly observed in massive colliding wind (CW) binaries. We present new Chandra X-ray observations of θ Mus, which complement previous XMM-Newton observations. The X-ray emission consists of a cool, nearly steady, weakly absorbed plasma component with broad redshifted emission lines located in an extended region far from the SB system. Hotter plasma is also present traced by Fe xxv emission. The observed flux in the ≈2–5 keV range dropped significantly on a timescale of ≤5 yr. The flux decrease can be attributed to an increase in absorption toward the hotter plasma which is likely located in the confined wind interaction region of the short-period SB system. The X-ray emission of θ Mus is remarkably similar to the WC+O binary γ2 Vel including carbon recombination spectral lines but both systems show unusual line centroid properties that challenge CW models.

总结: <br />
本文利用暗能量光谱仪(DES)的早期数据，从中获得了223个红移z<1的极低金属贫的星系(XMPGs)的大样本。利用直接Te方法测定氧丰度，发现其中95个星系为确认的XMPGs，其余128个为候选XMPGs。这些XMPGs占DES观测星系总数的0.01%。大部分XMPGs具有约1/34太阳金属丰度、约1.5 × 10^7太阳质量的恒星质量和0.22太阳质量每年的星形成率。这些XMPGs主要分布在相对低密度的环境中，许多星系的恒星质量-金属丰度关系(MZRs)低于普通星系。通过与理论模拟的比较，发现XMPGs是高红移星形成星系的良好类比体。由于DESI调查的持续进行，这些XMPG种群的性质将得到更完整的大样本的进一步调查。 <div>
Extremely metal-poor galaxies (XMPGs) at relatively low redshift are excellent laboratories for studying galaxy formation and evolution in the early universe. Much effort has been spent on identifying them from large-scale spectroscopic surveys or spectroscopic follow-up observations. Previous work has identified a few hundred XMPGs. In this work, we obtain a large sample of 223 XMPGs at z &lt; 1 from the early data of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). The oxygen abundance is determined using the direct Te method based on the detection of the [O iii]λ4363 line. The sample includes 95 confirmed XMPGs based on the oxygen abundance uncertainty; the remaining 128 galaxies are regarded as XMPG candidates. These XMPGs are only 0.01% of the total DESI observed galaxies. Their coordinates and other properties are provided in the paper. The most XMPGs have an oxygen abundance of ∼1/34 Z⊙, a stellar mass of about 1.5 × 107M⊙, and a star formation rate of 0.22 M⊙ yr−1. The two most XMPGs present distinct morphologies suggesting different formation mechanisms. The local environmental investigation shows that XMPGs preferentially reside in relatively low-density regions. Many of them fall below the stellar mass–metallicity relations (MZRs) of normal star-forming galaxies. From a comparison of the MZR with theoretical simulations, it appears that XMPGs are good analogs to high-redshift star-forming galaxies. The nature of these XMPG populations will be further investigated in detail with larger and more complete samples from the ongoing DESI survey.

<title>Panic at the ISCO: Time-varying Double-peaked Broad Lines from Evolving Accretion Disks Are Common among Optically Variable AGNs</title>

总结：<br />
本研究识别出250个双峰发射源（DPEs），并提供了这些DPEs的宽Hα发射线区域的光谱建模以及适配的黑洞吸积盘属性目录。随后对12个DPEs进行了跟踪光谱观测，并发现约50%的DPEs在长达10-20年的时间尺度上显示出红峰和蓝峰相对强度的显著变化。光谱建模得出的黑洞吸积盘参数分析表明，DPEs并不处于特殊的吸积状态，而是在合适的条件下观察到的普通广谱线AGNs。研究还包括了可能的超大质量黑洞双星候选者SDSSJ1430+2303，并讨论了其与ZTF调查中的发射盘AGN种群的光度和光谱变化一致性。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
About 3%–10% of Type I active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have double-peaked broad Balmer lines in their optical spectra originating from the motion of gas in their accretion disk. Double-peaked profiles arise not only in AGNs, but occasionally appear during optical flares from tidal disruption events and changing-state AGNs. In this paper, we identify 250 double-peaked emitters (DPEs) among a parent sample of optically variable broad-line AGNs in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey, corresponding to a DPE fraction of 19%. We model spectra of the broad Hα emission-line regions and provide a catalog of the fitted accretion disk properties for the 250 DPEs. Analysis of power spectra derived from the 5 yr ZTF light curves finds that DPE light curves have similar amplitudes and power-law indices to other broad-line AGNs. Follow-up spectroscopy of 12 DPEs reveals that ∼50% display significant changes in the relative strengths of their red and blue peaks over long 10–20 yr timescales, indicating that broad-line profile changes arising from spiral arm or hotspot rotation are common among optically variable DPEs. Analysis of the accretion disk parameters derived from spectroscopic modeling provides evidence that DPEs are not in a special accretion state, but are simply normal broad-line AGNs viewed under the right conditions for the accretion disk to be easily visible. We include inspiraling supermassive black hole binary candidate SDSSJ1430+2303 in our analysis, and discuss how its photometric and spectroscopic variability is consistent with the disk-emitting AGN population in the ZTF survey.

<div> Chandra X-ray Observatory, M33, X-ray variability, high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), monitoring survey
<br /><br />总结: 本研究利用Chandra X射线天文台对邻近的螺旋星系M33进行了为期五个纪元的监测调查，主要探究了时间间隔在两周至四个月之间的X射线变化。研究表征了55个核外明亮点源的X射线变化，其中许多被认为是高质量X射线双星（HMXBs）。在先前的M33 X射线目录中检测到了八个新的候选暂现源，并讨论了它们可能的性质。最终目录中包括了文献中确定的26个已知的HMXB候选者。通过包括这些源的档案X射线观测，我们将X射线光变曲线的基线延长了到21年。我们将源的检测和非检测时期与一系列模拟源的工作循环进行比较，推断出大多数检测到的源的工作循环>30%。我们发现只有四个源的检测模式与具有<30%工作循环一致。这种高工作循环的源比例对于HMXB群体来说是意外的，因此更频繁的X射线监测可能会揭示出更多的低工作循环HMXBs。 <div>
We present a new five-epoch Chandra X-ray Observatory monitoring survey of the nearby spiral galaxy M33 which probes X-ray variability with time sampling between two weeks and four months. We characterize the X-ray variability of 55 bright point sources outside of the nucleus, many of which are expected to be high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs). We detect eight new candidate transients not detected in previous X-ray catalogs of M33 and discuss their possible nature. The final catalog includes 26 known HMXB candidates identified in the literature. We extend the baseline of the X-ray light curves up to 21 yr by including archival X-ray observations of these sources. We compare the detection and nondetection epochs of the sources to suites of simulated source duty cycles and infer that most of our detected sources have duty cycles &gt;30%. We find only four sources whose detection patterns are consistent with having duty cycles below 30%. This large fraction of sources with high duty cycles is unexpected for a population of HMXBs; thus more frequent X-ray monitoring will likely reveal many more low duty cycle HMXBs in M33.

<div> 关键词: 太阳, 宇宙射线, 伽马射线, 磁场, 太阳大气

总结:
太阳是明亮的伽马射线源，由于宇宙射线与太阳气体的有声子作用而产生。文章介绍了一个简化的太阳磁场模型，用于捕捉与伽马射线产生相关的主要要素。此模型改进了先前的模型，能够合理地产生在1-200 GeV范围内由Fermi大面积望远镜观测到的硬谱和由高海拔水切可夫观测站（HAWC）在约103 GeV附近观测到的明显较软的谱线。文章指出，低能（≤10 GeV）的伽马射线主要产生在网络元素中，而高能（≳几十GeV）的伽马射线主要产生在网状结构之间的片状结构中。特别地，HAWC观测到的谱线变软是由于有限大小的网状结构对捕获和反射∼104 GeV宇宙射线的效果有限。该研究对理解太阳大气中的宇宙射线传输至关重要，并将为我们提供有关光球小尺度磁场的见解。 <br /><br /> <div>
The Sun is a bright gamma-ray source due to hadronic cosmic-ray interactions with solar gas. While it is known that incoming cosmic rays must generally first be reflected by solar magnetic fields to produce outgoing gamma rays, theoretical models have yet to reproduce the observed spectra. We introduce a simplified model of the solar magnetic fields that captures the main elements relevant to gamma-ray production. These are a flux tube, representing the network elements, and a flux sheet, representing the intergranular sheets. Both the tube and sheet have a horizontal size of order 100 km and serve as sites where cosmic rays are reflected and gamma rays are produced. While our simplified double-structure model does not capture all the complexities of the solar-surface magnetic fields, such as Alfvén turbulence from wave interactions or magnetic fluctuations from convection motions, it improves on previous models by reasonably producing both the hard spectrum seen by Fermi Large Area Telescope at 1–200 GeV and the considerably softer spectrum seen by the High Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC) at near 103 GeV. We show that lower-energy (≲10 GeV) gamma rays are primarily produced in the network elements and higher-energy (≳few × 10 GeV) gamma rays in the intergranular sheets. Notably, the spectrum softening observed by HAWC results from the limited effectiveness of capturing and reflecting ∼104 GeV cosmic rays by the finite-sized intergranular sheets. Our study is important for understanding cosmic-ray transport in the solar atmosphere and will lead to insights into small-scale magnetic fields at the photosphere.

总结:<br />
GW170817观测到了第一个二进制中子星合并的光学对应体，并且开启了多信使天体物理的新时代。结合引力波数据和光学对应体的信息揭示了关于合并系统性质的丰富信息。目前仅有一次GW事件观测到了kilonova，限制了我们对其起源和传播的精确理解。本文使用了条件变分自动编码器(CVAE)对两种不同时间长度的kilonova模型进行训练，可以快速准确地生成kilonova光变曲线。实施这一技术可以提供快速和可靠的结果，为多信使天体物理研究提供了新的工具。 <div>
The discovery of the optical counterpart, along with the gravitational waves (GWs) from GW170817, of the first binary neutron star merger has opened up a new era for multimessenger astrophysics. Combining the GW data with the optical counterpart, also known as AT 2017gfo and classified as a kilonova, has revealed the nature of compact binary merging systems by extracting enriched information about the total binary mass, the mass ratio, the system geometry, and the equation of state. Even though the detection of kilonovae has brought about a revolution in the domain of multimessenger astronomy, there has been only one kilonova from a GW-detected binary neutron star merger event confirmed so far, and this limits the exact understanding of the origin and propagation of the kilonova. Here, we use a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) trained on light-curve data from two kilonova models having different temporal lengths, and consequently, generate kilonova light curves rapidly based on physical parameters of our choice with good accuracy. Once the CVAE is trained, the timescale for light-curve generation is of the order of a few milliseconds, which is a speedup of the generation of light curves by 1000 times as compared to the simulation. The mean squared error between the generated and original light curves is typically 0.015 with a maximum of 0.08 for each set of considered physical parameters, while having a maximum of ≈0.6 error across the whole parameter space. Hence, implementing this technique provides fast and reliably accurate results.

TRAPPIST-1e行星的大气离子化，中性和离子化学以及大气生物标志的影响是本研究的关键点。通过模拟六种不同情境，发现类似卡林顿事件会大幅增加大气离子化并引起离子化学和光谱传输特征的显著变化。氮 dioxide含量大幅增加，水带深度减小，甲烷带减少，臭氧减少。这显示了必须考虑高能粒子效应，才能正确识别臭氧和甲烷等生物标志信号。另外，发现硝酸在湿润和枯落大气中的特征是不同的。总结：TRAPPIST-1e大气在强烈的恒星能量粒子事件下会出现显著变化，需要考虑高能粒子的影响才能准确识别生物标志信号。 <div>
Ongoing observing projects like the James Webb Space Telescope and future missions offer the chance to characterize Earth-like exoplanetary atmospheres. Thereby, M dwarfs are preferred targets for transit observations, for example, due to their favorable planet–star contrast ratio. However, the radiation and particle environment of these cool stars could be far more extreme than what we know from the Sun. Thus, knowing the stellar radiation and particle environment and its possible influence on detectable biosignatures—in particular, signs of life like ozone and methane—is crucial to understanding upcoming transit spectra. In this study, with the help of our unique model suite INCREASE, we investigate the impact of a strong stellar energetic particle event on the atmospheric ionization, neutral and ion chemistry, and atmospheric biosignatures of TRAPPIST-1e. Therefore, transit spectra for six scenarios are simulated. We find that a Carrington-like event drastically increases atmospheric ionization and induces substantial changes in ion chemistry and spectral transmission features: all scenarios show high event-induced amounts of nitrogen dioxide (i.e., at 6.2 μm), a reduction of the atmospheric transit depth in all water bands (i.e., at 5.5–7.0 μm), a decrease of the methane bands (i.e., at 3.0–3.5 μm), and depletion of ozone (i.e., at ∼9.6 μm). Therefore, it is essential to include high-energy particle effects to correctly assign biosignature signals from, e.g., ozone and methane. We further show that the nitric acid feature at 11.0–12.0 μm, discussed as a proxy for stellar particle contamination, is absent in wet-dead atmospheres.

利用JWST-CEERS数据，对宇宙早期（0.5–3亿年）质量巨大星系（M* > 10^9.5M⊙）中星形成的抑制进行了分析。通过使用先进的统计方法，对多维和相互关联的参数空间进行准确限制，确定了星系停止形成恒星的内在依赖性。在两种最先进的宇宙学模拟（IllustrisTNG和EAGLE）中，确定了关键的可验证预测，预测星系的停止形成恒星应该由早期宇宙中的超大质量黑洞质量所调控。在光度观测中，星系的重力潜能（ϕ*）被发现是超大质量黑洞质量的最佳替代品。在JWST-CEERS中，星系的停星潜能在所有时期（z = 0–8）都是质量巨大星系停止形成恒星的最具预测性的参数。这些结果强烈暗示了一个稳定的停星机制在宇宙历史上一直在起作用，与星系的中心重力潜能密切相关。在宇宙模型中，这种联系通过超大质量黑洞在深潜势井中形成和增长，随后通过混合的主动星系核反馈对星系进行停星解释。

3. 两种宇宙学模拟都预测了停星应该由超大质量黑洞质量调控。

We present an analysis of the quenching of star formation in massive galaxies (M* &gt; 109.5M⊙) within the first 0.5–3 Gyr of the Universe’s history utilizing JWST-CEERS data. We utilize a combination of advanced statistical methods to accurately constrain the intrinsic dependence of quenching in a multidimensional and intercorrelated parameter space. Specifically, we apply random forest classification, area statistics, and a partial correlation analysis to the JWST-CEERS data. First, we identify the key testable predictions from two state-of-the-art cosmological simulations (IllustrisTNG and EAGLE). Both simulations predict that quenching should be regulated by supermassive black hole mass in the early Universe. Furthermore, both simulations identify the stellar potential (ϕ*) as the optimal proxy for black hole mass in photometric data. In photometric observations, where we have no direct constraints on black hole masses, we find that the stellar potential is the most predictive parameter of massive galaxy quenching at all epochs from z = 0–8, exactly as predicted by simulations for this sample. The stellar potential outperforms stellar mass, galaxy size, galaxy density, and Sérsic index as a predictor of quiescence at all epochs probed in JWST-CEERS. Collectively, these results strongly imply a stable quenching mechanism operating throughout cosmic history, which is closely connected to the central gravitational potential in galaxies. This connection is explained in cosmological models via massive black holes forming and growing in deep potential wells, and subsequently quenching galaxies through a mix of ejective and preventative active galactic nucleus feedback.

Fukui et al. quantified the hadronic and leptonic gamma-rays in the young TeV gamma-ray shell-type supernova remnant (SNR) RX J1713.7-3946 (RX J1713), and demonstrated that gamma rays are a combination of hadronic and leptonic gamma-ray components with a ratio of ∼6: 4 in gamma-ray counts Ng. This discovery, which adopted a new methodology of multi-linear gamma-ray decomposition, was the first quantification of the two gamma-ray components. In the present work, we applied the same methodology to another TeV gamma-ray shell-type SNR RX J0852.0-4622 (RXJ0852) in 3D space characterized by (the interstellar proton column density Np)-(the nonthermal X-ray count Nx)-[Ng], and quantified the hadronic and leptonic gamma-ray components as having a ratio of ∼5:5 in Ng. The present work adopted the fitting of two/three flat planes in 3D space instead of a single flat plane, which allowed suppression of the fitting errors. This quantification indicates that hadronic and leptonic gamma-rays are of the same order of magnitude in these two core-collapse SNRs, verifying the significant hadronic gamma-ray components. We argue that the target interstellar protons, in particular their spatial distribution, are essential in any attempts to identify the type of particles responsible for gamma-ray emission. The present results confirm that cosmic-ray (CR) energy ≲100 TeV is compatible with a scheme in which SNRs are the dominant source of these Galactic CRs.

Nonlinear gravitational evolution induces strong nonlinearities in the observed cosmological density fields, leading to positive off-diagonal correlations in the power spectrum covariance. This has caused the information saturation in the power spectrum, e.g., the neutrino mass constraints from the nonlinear power spectra are lower than their linear counterparts by a factor of ∼2 at z = 0. In this paper, we explore how nonlinear reconstruction methods improve the cosmological information from nonlinear cosmic fields. By applying nonlinear reconstruction to cold dark matter fields from the Quijote simulations, we find that nonlinear reconstruction can improve the constraints on cosmological parameters significantly, nearly reaching the linear theory limit. For neutrino mass, the result is only 12% lower than the linear power spectrum, i.e., the theoretical best result. This makes nonlinear reconstruction an efficient and useful method to extract neutrino information from current and upcoming galaxy surveys.

The ability to determine galaxy properties such as masses, ages, and star formation rates robustly is critically limited by the ability to measure dust attenuation accurately. Dust reddening is often characterized by comparing observations to models of either nebular recombination lines or the UV continuum. Here, we use a new technique to measure dust reddening by exploiting the He iiλ1640 and λ4686 emission lines originating from the stellar winds of Wolf–Rayet stars. The intrinsic line ratio is determined by atomic physics, enabling an estimate of the stellar reddening similar to how the Balmer lines probe gas-emission reddening. The He ii line ratio is measured from UV and optical spectroscopy using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope for eight nearby galaxies hosting young massive star clusters. We compare our results to dust reddening values estimated from UV spectral slopes and from Balmer line ratios and find tentative evidence for systematic differences. The reddening derived from the He ii lines tends to be higher, whereas that from the UV continuum tends to be lower. A larger sample size is needed to confirm this trend. If confirmed, this may indicate an age sequence probing different stages of dust clearing. Broad He ii lines have also been detected in galaxies more distant than in our sample, providing the opportunity to estimate the dust reddening of the youngest stellar populations out to distances of ∼100 Mpc.

总结:
核心坍缩超新星的爆炸能量可能有所不同，当爆炸能量较低时，初始冲击波速度可能会减速至与母体速度接近。这会导致重力对爆炸流体动力学的影响，并可能导致冲击波在母体星内大半径处停滞。研究人员通过发展一种微扰方法来模拟这种弱爆炸的特殊属性，并得出结论，如果爆炸能量低于临界值，冲击波将在母体内停滞。该模型在与流体力学模拟结果的对比中表现出良好的一致性，准确预测了冲击波位置、速度以及停滞位置。这些结果对于黑洞形成和新发现的快速X射线暴（FXTs）具有重要影响。特别是，研究人员推测“幻影冲击波突破”——即星体外层冲破停滞冲击波——可以产生X射线爆发，但不会有随后的光学/紫外线迹象，类似于FXTs。该模型还预测了X射线爆发的上升时间td和平均光子能量kT之间存在反相关关系，大致为T∝{t}_{{\rm{d}}}^{-5/8}。 <div>
Observations and theory suggest that core-collapse supernovae can span a range of explosion energies, and when sub-energetic the shockwave initiating the explosion can decelerate to speeds comparable to the escape speed of the progenitor. In these cases, gravity will complicate the explosion hydrodynamics and conceivably cause the shock to stall at large radii within the progenitor star. To understand these unique properties of weak explosions, we develop a perturbative approach for modeling the propagation of an initially strong shock into a time-steady, infalling medium in the gravitational field of a compact object. This method writes the shock position and the post-shock velocity, density, and pressure as series solutions in the (time-dependent) ratio of the freefall speed to the shock speed, and predicts that the shock stalls within the progenitor if the explosion energy is below a critical value. We show that our model agrees very well with hydrodynamic simulations, and accurately predicts (for example) the time-dependent shock position and velocity and the radius at which the shock stalls. Our results have implications for black hole formation and the newly detected class of fast X-ray transients (FXTs). In particular, we propose that a “phantom shock breakout”—where the outer edge of the star falls through a stalled shock—can yield a burst of X-rays without a subsequent optical/UV signature, similar to FXTs. This model predicts the rise time of the X-ray burst, td, and the mean photon energy, kT, are anticorrelated, approximately as T\propto {t}_{{\rm{d}}}^{-5/8}.

We examine the evolution of ion-beam Weibel instability at strong collisionless shocks in weakly magnetized media. We find that a finite background magnetic field substantially affects both the linear and nonlinear phases of the instability, depending on whether the background electrons behave magnetized or not. Particle-in-cell simulations for magnetized electrons identify a dynamo-like mechanism of magnetic field amplification, which eventually leads to spontaneous magnetic reconnection. We conclude that this scenario is applicable to typical young supernova remnant shocks.

<div> 磁场波动，极化特征，离子尺度波动，线性稳定性分析，帕克太阳探测器<br />总结:
本文研究了帕克太阳探测器第四次相遇中的一次离子尺度波事件，其中包括左手偏振突然过渡为强烈的右手偏振，伴随着阿尔法粒子和质子速度分布函数中的明显核心束结构。线性稳定性分析表明，左手偏振波主要由质子核心种群中的质子回旋不稳定性驱动，并且右手偏振波主要由次要阿尔法束种群中的火管样不稳定性驱动。左手偏振到右手偏振的突然转变是由质子核心温度各向异性降低引起的。作者发现线性理论预测的不稳定波模式的频率和极化与磁场谱中观测到的非常吻合。这项工作深入了解了哪些确切的不稳定可能在内太阳系的波－粒子相互作用中起作用并调节能量转移，同时也强调了次要阿尔法种群可能作为一个很少考虑的自由能源的来源，可用于产生波动活动。 <div>
Ion-scale wave events or wave storms in the solar wind are characterized by enhancements in magnetic field fluctuations as well as coherent magnetic field polarization signatures at or around the local ion cyclotron frequencies. In this paper, we study in detail one such wave event from Parker Solar Probe's (PSP) fourth encounter, consisting of an initial period of left-handed (LH) polarization abruptly transitioning to a strong period of right-handed (RH) polarization, accompanied by a clear core beam structure in both the alpha and proton velocity distribution functions. A linear stability analysis shows that the LH-polarized waves are anti-sunward propagating Alfvén/ion cyclotron waves primarily driven by a proton cyclotron instability in the proton core population, and the RH polarized waves are anti-sunward propagating fast magnetosonic/whistler waves driven by a firehose-like instability in the secondary alpha beam population. The abrupt transition from LH to RH is caused by a drop in the proton core temperature anisotropy. We find very good agreement between the frequencies and polarizations of the unstable wave modes as predicted by linear theory and those observed in the magnetic field spectra. Given the ubiquity of ion-scale wave signatures observed by PSP, this work gives insight into which exact instabilities may be active and mediating energy transfer in wave–particle interactions in the inner heliosphere, as well as highlighting the role a secondary alpha population may play as a rarely considered source of free energy available for producing wave activity.

Cen A是离银河系最近的活跃星系核，是研究黑洞附近动力过程的理想目标。本文介绍了2022年进行的14次Chandra HETGS光谱观测，并将它们相互比较，并与2001年的两个Chandra HETGS光谱进行对比。通过这些观测，对几个月和21年时间尺度上发生的光谱变化进行了调查。所有的Chandra光谱都可以很好地用吸收功率谱拟合，包括一个强烈而窄的Fe Kα线，低能处的泄漏功率谱特征，以及Si和S Kα线。在观测过程中，连续谱的通量变化了2.74 ± 0.05倍，而Fe线仅变化了18.8% ± 8.8%。光子指数在21年内增加，氢柱密度在几个月内也发生了显著变化。Fe Kα线的能量比Cen A的红移预期要低，相对于Cen A有326+84-94 km/s的过剩速度。我们对此偏移进行了扭曲的吸积盘、整体运动和流出等可能的解释。光谱中还有来自Fe xxv和Fe xxvi的离子化吸收线，描述了一个可变的流入。<br /><br />总结: Cen A是最近的活跃星系核，对其进行了Chandra HETGS光谱观测，发现了多个光谱变化的现象，包括连续谱通量和Fe线的变化，光子指数的增加，氢柱密度的变化，以及Fe Kα线的能量偏移。研究也描述了可能的形成原因，如扭曲的吸积盘、整体运动和流出。 <div>
Cen A hosts the closest active galactic nucleus to the Milky Way, which makes it an ideal target for investigating the dynamical processes in the vicinity of accreting supermassive black holes. In this paper, we present 14 Chandra HETGS spectra of the nucleus of Cen A that were observed throughout 2022. We compared them with each other, and contrasted them against the two previous Chandra HETGS spectra from 2001. This enabled an investigation into the spectral changes occurring on timescales of months and 21 years. All Chandra spectra could be well fitted by an absorbed power law with a strong and narrow Fe Kα line, a leaked power-law feature at low energies, and Si and S Kα lines that could not be associated with the central engine. The flux of the continuum varied by a factor of 2.74 ± 0.05 over the course of the observations, whereas the Fe line only varied by 18.8% ± 8.8%. The photon index increased over 21 years, and the hydrogen column density varied significantly within a few months as well. The Fe Kα line was found at a lower energy than expected from the Cen A redshift, amounting to an excess velocity of {326}_{-94}^{+84}\,\mathrm{km}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1} relative to Cen A. We investigated warped accretion disks, bulk motion, and outflows as possible explanations of this shift. The spectra also featured ionized absorption lines from Fe xxv and Fe xxvi, describing a variable inflow.

总结:
球状星团中的恒星显示出化学组成的差异，这一特征无法被目前的任何机制完全解释。研究者通过发展了一种星体建模方法，利用多色差光度法为47 Tucanae球状星团的恒星准确获取了化学丰度。他们发现了化学元素丰度的分布规律，而这不支持恒星相互作用作为化学差异的起源。但需要更准确的吸积理论来得出更确切的结论。未来，随着詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜对47 Tucanae球状星团的观测，将扩展我们的分析质量基线到次恒星级别。因此，研究者还展示了47 Tucanae棕矮星成员的预测色-星等图和质量-星等关系。<br /><br /> <div>
Despite their shared origin, members of globular clusters display star-to-star variations in composition. The observed pattern of element abundances is unique to these stellar environments and cannot be fully explained by any proposed mechanism. It remains unclear whether stars form with chemical heterogeneity or inherit it from interactions with other members. These scenarios may be differentiated by the dependence of chemical spread on stellar mass; however, obtaining a sufficiently large mass baseline requires abundance measurements on the lower main sequence, which is too faint for spectroscopy even in the nearest globular clusters. We developed a stellar modeling method to obtain precise chemical abundances for stars near the end of the main sequence from multiband photometry, and we applied it to the globular cluster 47 Tucanae. The computational efficiency is attained by matching chemical elements to the model components that are most sensitive to their abundance. We determined [O/Fe] for ∼5000 members below the main-sequence knee at the level of accuracy, comparable to the spectroscopic measurements of evolved members in the literature. The inferred distribution disfavors stellar interactions as the origin of chemical spread; however, an accurate theory of accretion is required to draw a more definitive conclusion. We anticipate that future observations of 47 Tucanae with the James Webb Space Telescope will extend the mass baseline of our analysis into the substellar regime. Therefore, we present predicted color–magnitude diagrams and mass–magnitude relations for the brown dwarf members of 47 Tucanae.

总结:<br />
本文介绍了在深空探测领域中，对小行星特别是作为潜在威胁的二元小行星物理特性进行估算的挑战。提出了一个新颖的二元小行星模型，结合了轨道和自转运动，通过两个Cellinoid形状的投影和掩星效应来生成模拟亮度。通过Levenberg-Marquardt算法对物理特性进行反演，并通过数值实验和对真实二元小行星的应用进行了验证。研究结果表明，该模型提供了可靠且准确的二元小行星物理特性估算，同时还具有在支持双小行星重定向测试(DART)项目中的潜在应用。 <div>
The field of space science places significant emphasis on deep space exploration, with a particular focus on asteroids as a potential hazard to humanity. Inverting their physical characteristics from photometric observations is essential for uncovering their origins and evolution. This article attempts to present a solution to the challenging task of estimating the physical properties of binary asteroids, which are common in near-Earth asteroids larger than 200 meters. A novel model for binary asteroids is proposed, which integrates orbital and rotational motions to simulate brightness variations based on two Cellinoid shapes. The model combines the projection and occultation effects of the shapes to generate the simulated brightness. The inversion of determining physical properties is optimized based on the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm through a simulation process involving several parameter corrections. Finally, the performance of the proposed model is demonstrated through numerical experiments and applications to two real binary asteroids, namely, asteroid (317) Roxane and asteroid (624) Hektor. The derived results are nearly identical to those from other publications, which confirms that the proposed model provides reliable and accurate estimations of the physical properties of binary asteroids. Additionally, this method has a potential application in supporting the development of effective strategies for the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) project, the first planetary defense experiment in space undertaken by humans.

We present results from long-term monitoring of frequency-dependent eclipses of the radio emission from PSR J1544+4937, which is a black widow spider millisecond pulsar (MSP) in a compact binary system. The majority of such systems often exhibit relatively long-duration radio eclipses caused by ablated material from their companion stars. With the wide spectral bandwidth of the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, we present the first systematic study of temporal variation of eclipse cutoff frequency. With decade-long monitoring of 39 eclipses for PSR J1544+4937, we notice significant changes in the observed cutoff frequency ranging from 343 ± 7 to ≥740 MHz. We also monitored changes in eclipse cutoff frequency on timescales of tens of days and observed a maximum change of ≥315 MHz between observations that were separated by 22 days. In addition, we observed a change of ∼47 MHz in eclipse cutoff frequency between adjacent orbits, i.e., on timescales of ∼2.9 hr. We infer that such changes in the eclipse cutoff frequency depict an eclipse environment for the PSR J1544+4937 system that is dynamically evolving, where, along with the change in electron density, the magnetic field could also be varying. We also report a significant correlation between the eclipse cutoff frequency and the mass-loss rate of the companion. This study provides the first direct evidence of mass-loss rate affecting the frequency-dependent eclipsing in a spider MSP.

<div> 关键词: Leike et al., 3D dust map, molecular clouds, mass-size relation, volume density

本研究利用Leike等人的3D尘埃地图，结合其约1 pc空间分辨率，生成了太阳附近分子云的均匀目录。通过精确的距离测量，我们消除了质量、大小和密度方面的许多不确定性，对65个云的性质进行了真实的3D空间测量。目录中的云总共包含1.1×105太阳质量，跨越116-440 pc的距离范围，并包括文献中已广泛研究的十几个云。除了在3D体积密度空间推导云的性质外，我们还通过将3D云投影到2D“天空”视图上，创建了2D尘埃消光图。我们分别测量了2D云和3D云的性质。我们比较了遵循Larson定律的云的质量和大小之间的比例关系。我们发现我们的2D投影质量-大小关系M∝r2.1符合Larson的第三关系，但我们的3D推导性质导致了约一个数量级更大的比例关系：M∝r2.9。验证了理论和数值模拟的预测，我们的结果表明，质量-大小关系对于定义云的面密度或体积密度敏感，因为质量在2D中按照面积缩放（M∝r2），在3D中按照体积缩放（M∝r3）。我们的结果表明，分子云的表面密度和体积密度在2D和3D中大致保持恒定，这与在云的质量预算中占主导地位的低密度、较大体积充填气体对云的预期情况相符。 <br /><br />总结: 本研究利用Leike等人的3D尘埃地图，对太阳附近的分子云进行了全面的研究，得出了关于云的质量-大小关系的新发现，对分子云的性质提供了更精确的认识。 <div>
We dendrogram the Leike et al. 3D dust map, leveraging its ∼1 pc spatial resolution to produce a uniform catalog of molecular clouds in the solar neighborhood. Using accurate distances, we measure the properties of 65 clouds in true 3D space, eliminating much of the uncertainty in mass, size, and density. Clouds in the catalog contain a total of 1.1 × 105M☉, span distances of 116−440 pc, and include a dozen well-studied clouds in the literature. In addition to deriving cloud properties in 3D volume density space, we create 2D dust extinction maps from the 3D data by projecting the 3D clouds onto a 2D “Sky” view. We measure the properties of the 2D clouds separately from the 3D clouds. We compare the scaling relation between the masses and sizes of clouds following Larson. We find that our 2D projected mass–size relation, M ∝ r2.1, agrees with Larson's Third Relation, but our 3D derived properties lead to a scaling relation of about one order larger: M ∝ r2.9. Validating predictions from theory and numerical simulations, our results indicate that the mass–size relation is sensitive to whether column or volume density is used to define clouds, since mass scales with area in 2D (M ∝ r2) and with volume in 3D (M ∝ r3). Our results imply a roughly constant column and volume density in 2D and 3D, respectively, for molecular clouds, as would be expected for clouds where the lower density, larger volume-filling gas dominates the cloud mass budget.

<div> z ∼ 6, star formation rate function, spectral energy distribution, rest-frame UV, Schechter function
<br /><br />总结: 该研究在z ∼ 6时提出了一个星体形成率函数（SFRF），该函数基于对CANDELS GOODS-South和North领域中星系的光谱能量分布拟合推导出的恒星形成率（SFR）。研究结果显示，在z ∼ 6时的SFRF相较于仅根据红移UV观测修正尘埃衰减的光度函数（LF）估计结果有过剩，并且可与远红外LF估计相媲美。研究使用Schechter函数参数化SFRF，并在固定斜率和特征数密度的情况下得到了最佳拟合参数。而在z ∼ 6时的最佳适应SFR*与z ∼ 2时的相当，这是宇宙中星体形成活动达到顶峰的时期。此外，通过类似方法使用红移UV到光学数据进行的SFRF估计还发现，在z ∼ 2到∼6时期，SFR*大致保持不变，而在z ∼ 6以上可能有所减少。SFR*对SFRF的高SFR端敏感，这种SFR*的演变表明，在再电离时期，SFRF的高SFR端迅速增长，并达到了在z ∼ 2时观测到的水平。 <div>
We present a star formation rate function (SFRF) at z ∼ 6 based on star formation rates (SFRs) derived by spectral energy distribution fitting on data from rest-frame UV to optical wavelengths of galaxies in the CANDELS GOODS-South and North fields. The resulting SFRF shows an excess compared to the previous estimations by using rest-frame UV luminosity functions (LFs) corrected for the dust attenuation and is comparable to that estimated from a far-infrared LF. This suggests that the number density of dust-obscured intensively star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 6 has been underestimated in the previous approach based only on rest-frame UV observations. We parameterize the SFRF using the Schechter function and obtain the best-fit parameter of the characteristic SFR (SFR*) when the faint-end slope and characteristic number density are fixed. The best-fit SFR* at z ∼ 6 is comparable to that at z ∼ 2, when the cosmic star formation activity reaches its peak. Together with SFRF estimations with a similar approach using rest-frame UV to optical data, the SFR* is roughly constant from z ∼ 2 to ∼6 and may decrease above z ∼ 6. Since the SFR* is sensitive to the high-SFR end of the SFRF, this evolution of SFR* suggests that the high-SFR end of the SFRF grows rapidly during the epoch of reionization and reaches a similar level observed at z ∼ 2.

A statistical model is used to determine how stochastic fluctuations in the intensities of orthogonal polarization modes contribute to the modulation and depolarization of pulsar radio emission. General expressions for the distributions of the Stokes parameters, linear polarization, polarization position angle, and fractional polarization are derived when the mode intensities follow the same or different probability distributions. The transition between modes is examined. When the mode intensities follow the same distribution, the fractional linear polarization and modulation index are symmetric about the transition. The symmetry is disrupted when the mode intensities follow different distributions. The fractional linear polarization is minimum and the mode frequency of occurrence changes rapidly at transitions where the mode intensity distributions are the same and the modulation index is small. A lower limit on the fractional linear polarization that can be attained via the simultaneous occurrence of the modes as a function of modulation index is quantified.

Close encounters between stellar-mass black holes (BHs) and stars occur frequently in dense star clusters and in the disks of active galactic nuclei. Recent studies have shown that in highly eccentric close encounters, the star can be tidally disrupted by the BH in a microtidal disruption event (microTDE), resulting in rapid mass accretion and possibly bright electromagnetic signatures. Here we consider a scenario in which the star might approach the stellar-mass BH in a gradual, nearly circular inspiral, under the influence of dynamical friction in a circum-binary gas disk or three-body interactions in a star cluster. We perform hydrodynamics simulations of this scenario using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code PHANTOM. We find that under certain circumstances (for initial eccentricity e0 ≳ 0.4 and penetration factor β = 1, or e0 &lt; 0.4 and β ≲ 0.67), the mass of the star is slowly stripped away by the BH. We call this gradual tidal disruption a “tidal-peeling event.” Additionally, we discover that some low-eccentricity microTDEs (e0 &lt; 0.4 and β = 1) are a new form of fast luminous transients similar to parabolic microTDEs. Depending on the initial distance and eccentricity of the encounter, these low-eccentricity microTDEs might exhibit significant accretion rates and orbital evolution distinct from those of a typical (eccentric) microTDE.

这项研究分析了太阳活动区产生日冕质量抛射（CME）的能力与光球直接电流与返程电流的比值∣DC/RC∣的关系。研究发现，具有∣DC/RC∣> 1.63和PIL剪切角> 45°（平均值分别为3.2°和68°）的喷发性耀斑源区往往具有更高的CME产生潜力，而对于困禁性耀斑源区，这两个量的平均值要小一些（分别为2.2°和68°），但存在重叠区域。此外，研究还发现一些特定的困禁性耀斑源区具有∣DC/RC∣接近于1的情况，PIL剪切角很低，且没有明显的EDC签名，因此不太可能产生CME。研究结论指出，∣DC/RC∣和PIL剪切角在评估CME产生潜力方面具有几乎相同的效果，比文献中提出的其他代理变量更有效。此外，研究还讨论了对∣DC/RC∣计算和结果解释进行细致考量的特定案例，并提出可以通过纳入日冕测量指标如衰减指数来改进光球CME产生潜力的代理变量。 <br /><br />总结: 这项研究分析了光球直接电流与返程电流比值（∣DC/RC∣）以及PIL剪切角与太阳活动区产生日冕质量抛射（CME）的关系，揭示了它们在评估CME产生潜力方面的重要性，以及如何进一步改进这些代理变量的方法。 <div>
It has been suggested that the ratio of photospheric direct to return current, ∣DC/RC∣, may be a better proxy for assessing the ability of solar active regions to produce a coronal mass ejection (CME) than others such as the amount of shear along the polarity inversion line (PIL). To test this conjecture, we measure both quantities prior to eruptive and confined flares of varying magnitude. We find that eruptive-flare source regions have ∣DC/RC∣ &gt; 1.63 and PIL shear above 45° (average values of 3.°2 and 68°, respectively), tending to be larger for stronger events, while both quantities are on average smaller for confined-flare source regions (2.°2 and 68°, respectively), albeit with substantial overlap. Many source regions, especially those of eruptive X-class flares, exhibit elongated direct currents (EDCs) bracketing the eruptive PIL segment, which typically coincide with areas of continuous PIL shear above 45°. However, a small subset of confined-flare source regions have ∣DC/RC∣ close to unity, very low PIL shear (&lt;38°), and no clear EDC signatures, rendering such regions less likely to produce a CME. A simple quantitative analysis reveals that ∣DC/RC∣ and PIL shear are almost equally good proxies for assessing CME-productivity, comparable to other proxies suggested in the literature. We also show that an inadequate selection of the current-integration area typically yields a substantial underestimation of ∣DC/RC∣, discuss specific cases that require careful consideration for ∣DC/RC∣ calculation and interpretation of the results, and suggest improving photospheric CME-productivity proxies by incorporating coronal measures such as the decay index.

Intrigued by recent high-energy study results for nearby galaxies with γ-ray emission and in particular NGC 1068 that has been detected as a neutrino-emitting source by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, we conduct a detailed analysis of the γ-ray data of the galaxies NGC 1068 and NGC 253, obtained with the Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi γ-ray Space Telescope. By checking their possible spectral features and then constructing light curves in the corresponding energy ranges, we identify spectral-change activity from NGC 1068 in the ≥2 GeV energy range and long-term, statistically significant changes for NGC 253 in the ≥5 GeV energy range. In the former, the emission appears harder in two half-year periods than in the otherwise “quiescent” state. In the latter, an ∼two-fold decrease in the detection significance after MJD = 57023 is clearly revealed by the test-statistic maps we obtain. Considering the previous studies carried out and the various models proposed for the γ-ray emissions of the two sources, we discuss the implications of our findings. We suspect that a jet (or outflow) in NGC 1068 might contribute to the γ-ray emission. The nature of the long-term statistically significant changes for NGC 253 is not clear, but since the part of the GeV emission may be connected to the very-high-energy (VHE) emission from the center of the galaxy, it could be further probed with VHE observations.

<div> 关键词: 金属丰富，旋转双重不稳定超新星，质量范围，56Ni质量，质量损失历史

这篇论文重新探讨了与小麦哲伦星云、大麦哲伦星云（LMC）、和0.1太阳金属丰度一致的金属丰富旋转双重不稳定超新星（PISNe）模型。通过计算多个模型，我们打算澄清PISNe的质量范围和喷射出的56Ni质量，以及母体的质量损失历史。我们发现选择Wolf-Rayet（WR）质量损失率是很重要的，我们采用了最近提出的Sander & Vink的速率，它覆盖了PISNe前体的质量范围。我们发现慢速旋转降低了PISN范围，因为旋转混合导致了核心质量的增加。另一方面，当我们假设观测到的OB星的典型旋转速度时，质量损失增加变得更加显著，最终恒星的质量低于非旋转模型。因此，对于这些快速旋转模型，亮度超新星（SN）的典型质量范围，其56Ni质量高于10M⊙，分别为LMC和0.1Z⊙金属丰度，超过400和350M⊙。有趣的是，与以往的研究不同，我们发现大多数情况下是富氧的母体。这种富氧的母体可能与最近确定的PISN候选SN2018ibb一致。He-丰富的母体仅在相对暗淡和金属贫（Z ≲ 0.1Z⊙）的PISNe中出现。我们还讨论了金属丰富PISNe的黑洞质量间隙，并展示了间隙的上限低于III类群体的情况。

<br /><br />总结: 本研究重新探讨了金属丰富旋转双重不稳定超新星（PISNe）模型，以及与小麦哲伦星云、大麦哲伦星云（LMC）、和0.1太阳金属丰度一致的质量范围和地方。特别地，与之前研究不同的是发现了富氧的母体，这一发现与最近确定的PISN候选SN2018ibb相符。同时还讨论了金属丰富PISNe的黑洞质量间隙。 <div>
In this paper, we revisit metal-enriched rotating pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) models for metallicities consistent with the Small Magellanic Cloud, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and 0.1Z⊙. By calculating multiple models, we intend to clarify mass ranges and the ejected 56Ni masses from the PISNe, and mass-loss histories for progenitors. We find that the choice of the Wolf–Rayet (WR) mass-loss rates is important, and we adopt the recently proposed rate of Sander &amp; Vink, which covers the mass ranges for PISNe progenitors. We show that slow rotation lowers the PISN range because the core mass increases by rotational mixing. On the other hand, when we assume a typical rotation speed for observed OB stars, the mass-loss increase becomes more significant, and the final stellar masses are lower than in nonrotating models. As a result, the typical mass range for bright supernovae (SNe), with a 56Ni mass higher than 10M⊙ for these fast-rotating models is more than 400 and 350M⊙ for LMC and 0.1Z⊙ metallicities, respectively. It is interesting that unlike in previous works, we find oxygen-rich progenitors for most cases. This O-rich progenitor may be consistent with the recently identified PISN candidate SN2018ibb. He-rich progenitors are seen only for relatively dim and metal-poor (Z ≲ 0.1Z⊙) PISNe. We also discuss the black hole mass gap for metal-enriched PISNe, and we show that the upper bound for the gap is lower than in the Population III case.

总结: 
这篇文章使用零β假设进行数据约束模拟，研究了2012年5月5日太阳活动区11474中一个丝状物的强烈旋转和失败喷发的机制。他们发现两个磁流体扭曲构造在系统中，并且提出了一个可能的逆向旋转的猜测。模拟结果与观测特征吻合，包括约130°的丝状物大角度旋转、受限的喷发和耀斑丝状物振子。他们还发现了与观测中的丝状物和热通道对应的两个磁流体扭曲构造，它们在模拟中都经历了受限的喷发。他们指出MFR1的旋转与轴向的剪切场分量有关，并且MFR1的扭结和螺旋度的时间演化是可能逆转旋转的线索。相互作用也对大角度旋转和喷发失败起到了作用。 <div>
We perform a data-constrained simulation with the zero-β assumption to study the mechanisms of strong rotation and failed eruption of a filament in active region 11474 on 2012 May 5 observed by Solar Dynamics Observatory and Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory. The initial magnetic field is provided by nonlinear force-free field extrapolation, which is reconstructed by the regularized Biot–Savart laws and magnetofrictional method. Our simulation reproduces most observational features very well, e.g., the filament large-angle rotation of about 130°, the confined eruption, and the flare ribbons, allowing us to analyze the underlying physical processes behind observations. We discover two flux ropes in the sigmoid system, an upper flux rope (MFR1) and a lower flux rope (MFR2), which correspond to the filament and hot channel in observations, respectively. Both flux ropes undergo confined eruptions. MFR2 grows by tether-cutting reconnection during the eruption. The rotation of MFR1 is related to the shear-field component along the axis. The toroidal field tension force and the nonaxisymmetry forces confine the eruption of MFR1. We also suggest that the mutual interaction between MFR1 and MFR2 contributes to the large-angle rotation and the eruption failure. In addition, we calculate the temporal evolution of the twist and writhe of MFR1, which is a hint of probable reversal rotation.

<title>On the Role of Alfvénic Fluctuations as Mediators of Coherence within Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections: Investigation of Multi-spacecraft Measurements at 1 au</title>

<div> 关键词: ICMEs, Alfvénic fluctuations, coherence, magnetic field correlation, solar wind<br />
总结:<br />
本研究探讨了Alfvénic fluctuations（AFs）在行星际日冕物质抛射（ICMEs）的一致性中的作用。研究发现，大约65%的ICME鞘和90%的磁场喷发物（MEs）展现出延伸的AFs。交叉螺旋度表明太阳风和行星际来源的AFs可能在1天文单位处的ICME中共存。AFs主要集中在激波的下游和MEs的背部。磁场在ICME鞘内的相关性较差，而在MEs的前后，大多数磁场分量的相关性也减弱。AFs也与较低的磁场相关性相关联。这表明ICME的一致性可能不是通过Alfvén波来介导，这意味着一致性尺度可能比先前预测的更小，或者磁场相关性并不是一致性的衡量标准。 <div>
Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) are defined as “coherent” if they are capable of responding to external perturbations in a collective manner. This implies that information must be able to propagate across ICME structures, and if this is not the case, single-point in situ measurements cannot be considered as indicative of global ICME properties. Here, we investigate the role of Alfvénic fluctuations (AFs) as mediators of ICME coherence. We consider multipoint magnetic field and plasma measurements of 10 ICMEs observed by the ACE and Wind spacecraft at 1 au at longitudinal separations of 0.5°–0.7°. For each event, we analyze the Alfvénicity in terms of the residual energy and cross helicity of fluctuations, and the coherence in terms of the magnetic correlation between Wind and ACE. We find that ∼65% and 90% of ICME sheaths and magnetic ejecta (MEs), respectively, present extended AFs covering at least 20% of the structure. Cross helicity suggests AFs of solar and interplanetary origin may coexist in the ICME population at 1 au. AFs are mainly concentrated downstream of shocks and in the back of MEs. The magnetic field is poorly correlated within sheaths, while the correlation decreases from the front to the back of the MEs for most magnetic field components. AFs are also associated with lower magnetic field correlations. This suggests either that ICME coherence is not mediated by Alfvén waves, implying that the coherence scale may be smaller than previously predicted, or that the magnetic field correlation is not a measure of coherence.

Ultralight scalar fields and their noninteracting class, i.e., the so-called fuzzy dark matter (FDM), are dark matter candidates introduced to solve the small-scale problems of the standard cold dark matter. In this paper, we investigate whether the physics of FDM, particularly the quantum pressure that leads to the suppression of structure formation on small scales, could leave significant imprints on the large-scale statistics of matter fluctuations. For this purpose, we utilize the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structures (EFT of LSS), wherein small-scale physics is integrated and represented on large scales by only a set of free parameters. These parameters can be determined by fitting them into the cosmological simulations. By fitting the EFT predictions to the simulation data, we determine the value of the speed of sound as a quantitative measure of how UV physics affects large-scale perturbation. We use the Gadget-2 code to study the evolution of 5123 particles in a box with a side length 250 h−1 Mpc. We exploit the suppressed FDM initial power for the FDM universe and perform N-body simulation sufficient to produce accurate—enough for our purpose—results on large scales. In particular, we perform three FDM simulations with different masses and compare their sound speed with the standard cold dark matter (CDM) simulation. We found no difference between the FDM and CDM sound speeds beyond the confidence intervals. However, a consistently increasing trend can be seen in the sound speed for lower masses. This result suggests further investigations using higher-resolution simulations.

这篇论文通过利用LAMOST-Gaia红巨星样本恒星，综合研究了银河盘不同种群的动力学性质。作者发现在不同的空间和种群区间，存在大规模的整体运动，如径向速度的波动、方位速度的南北差异、以及垂直速度的弯曲信号。这些整体运动的振幅和空间相关性显示出不同年龄和丰度的种群存在显著的不同。此外，速度离散的全局空间行为清晰显示了螺旋臂的信号，以及在40亿年内的盘干扰事件的信号，外部区域的盘弯曲现象主要出现在年轻或α-贫的恒星种群中。通过对不同盘区域的年龄/α-丰度-速度离散关系的详细测量，发现年轻/α-贫的种群可能是由巨大分子云和螺旋臂的动态加热而产生，而老年/α-增强种群则需要其他加热机制的显著贡献，如合并和吸积，或者是在富气体系统的混合合并和/或湍动星际介质中产生。 
<br /><br />总结: <div>
We present a comprehensive study of the kinematic properties of the different Galactic disk populations, as defined by the chemical abundance ratios and stellar ages, across a large disk volume (4.5 ≤ R ≤ 15.0 kpc and ∣Z∣ ≤ 3.0 kpc), by using the LAMOST-Gaia red clump sample stars. We determine the median velocities for various spatial and population bins, finding large-scale bulk motions; for example, the wave-like behavior in radial velocity, the north–south discrepancy in azimuthal velocity and the warp signal in vertical velocity, and the amplitudes and spatial dependences of these bulk motions show significant variations for different mono-age and mono-abundance populations. The global spatial behaviors of the velocity dispersions clearly show a signal of spiral arms and a signal of the disk perturbation event within 4 Gyr, as well as disk flaring in the outer region (i.e., R ≥ 12 kpc), mostly for young or alpha-poor stellar populations. Our detailed measurements of age/[α/Fe]-velocity dispersion relations for different disk volumes indicate that young/α-poor populations are likely to originate from dynamic heating by both giant molecular clouds and spiral arms, while old/α-enhanced populations require an obvious contribution from other heating mechanisms, such as merger and accretion, or are born in the chaotic mergers of gas-rich systems and/or turbulent interstellar medium.

总结:<br /><br />本文研究了磁通绳的数值模拟，通过结合时间依赖磁摩擦方法和热力学磁流体动力学模型，成功地再现了观测到的磁通绳的形成和受限喷发，并揭示了观测背后的物理细节。对于活跃区的长期演化过程，模拟结果表明，由于碰撞剪切引起的磁通绳的形成起着至关重要的作用，导致磁自由能和螺旋度显著增加。在喷发阶段，磁通绳在喷发过程中的变形会导致向下张力的增加，从而抑制其进一步上升。这一发现可能揭示了为什么一些环状不稳定的磁通绳在大角度旋转后会导致失败的喷发。此外，我们发现扭曲的磁通在受限喷发期间会积累，这可能导致随后的喷发耀斑的产生。 <div>
Magnetic flux ropes are a bundle of twisted magnetic field lines produced by internal electric currents, which are responsible for solar eruptions and are the major drivers of geomagnetic storms. As such, it is crucial to develop a numerical model that can capture the entire evolution of a flux rope, from its birth to death, in order to predict whether adverse space weather events might occur or not. In this paper, we develop a data-driven modeling that combines a time-dependent magnetofrictional approach with a thermodynamic magnetohydrodynamic model. Our numerical modeling successfully reproduces the formation and confined eruption of an observed flux rope, and unveils the physical details behind the observations. Regarding the long-term evolution of the active region, our simulation results indicate that the flux cancellation due to collisional shearing plays a critical role in the formation of the flux rope, corresponding to a substantial increase in magnetic free energy and helicity. Regarding the eruption stage, the deformation of the flux rope during its eruption can cause an increase in the downward tension force, which suppresses it from further rising. This finding may shed light on why some torus-unstable flux ropes lead to failed eruptions after large-angle rotations. Moreover, we find that twisted fluxes can accumulate during confined eruptions, which would breed the subsequent eruptive flares.

We use time-domain simulations of Jupiter observations to test and develop a beam reconstruction pipeline for the Simons Observatory Small Aperture Telescopes. The method relies on a mapmaker that estimates and subtracts correlated atmospheric noise and a beam fitting code designed to compensate for the bias caused by the mapmaker. We test our reconstruction performance for four different frequency bands against various algorithmic parameters, atmospheric conditions, and input beams. We additionally show the reconstruction quality as a function of the number of available observations and investigate how different calibration strategies affect the beam uncertainty. For all of the cases considered, we find good agreement between the fitted results and the input beam model within an ∼1.5% error for a multipole range ℓ = 30–700 and an ∼0.5% error for a multipole range ℓ = 50–200. We conclude by using a harmonic-domain component separation algorithm to verify that the beam reconstruction errors and biases observed in our analysis do not significantly bias the Simons Observatory r-measurement

Some quasi-thermal (QT)-dominated gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) could be well described by a multicolor blackbody (mBB) function or a combined model of a BB plus a nonthermal (NT) component. In this analysis, two QT radiation-dominated bursts with known emission properties (GRB 210610B, likely from a hybrid jet, and GRB 210121A, with a spectrum consistent with nondissipative photospheric emission from a pure hot fireball) are used to make a comparison between these two models. To diagnose the magnetization properties of the central engine, the “top-down” approach proposed by Gao and Zhang is adopted. It is found that diagnoses based on these two models provide similar conclusions qualitatively; however, the model with mBB (or mBB+NT) may give more reasonable physical explanations. This implies that impacts from the GRB jet structure and geometrical broadening on the observed spectrum should be considered. However, conservatively, these methods may be not sensitive enough to distinguish between a pure hot fireball and a mildly magnetized hybrid jet. Some other information is necessary to provide more evidence when determining the jet properties for similar GRBs. Based on these considerations, we suggest that the photospheric emission of GRB 221022B is from a hot jet, where dissipation is caused by an internal shock mechanism due to the increasing Lorentz factor with time, which makes its prompt emission display typical evolution from thermal to NT.

总结:<br /><br />本研究报告了Parker Solar Probe（PSP）在第二次接触阶段通过低密度磁通道时检测到的一种弱太阳射电爆发（SRB）。这些弱SRB具有较低的起始频率（约20 MHz）和窄的频率范围（从几十MHz到几百kHz）。它们的动态谱显示出一个明显的演化特征，即中间相对漂移速率从0.01 s-1以上迅速下降至0.01 s-1以下。基于太阳冕等离子体的常见经验模型分析表明，这些弱SRB源自于约1.1-6.1个太阳半径的太阳风加速区，其等离子体的β值较低，其源的运动速度typical是∼vA（Alfvén速度），明显低于有效激发SRB所需的快电子的运动速度。我们提出，孤立的动力阿尔文波可能负责产生这些小尺度的弱SRB，称为孤立波辐射。 <div>
The Parker Solar Probe (PSP) provides us with an unprecedentedly close approach to the observation of the Sun and hence the possibility of directly understanding the elementary process that occurs on the kinetic scale of particles' collective interaction in solar coronal plasmas. We report a type of weak solar radio burst (SRB) that was detected by PSP when it passed a low-density magnetic channel during its second encounter phase. These weak SRBs have a low starting frequency of ∼20 MHz and a narrow frequency range from a few tens of MHz to a few hundred kHz. Their dynamic spectra display a strongly evolving feature of the intermediate relative drift rate decreasing rapidly from above 0.01 s−1 to below 0.01 s−1. Analyses based on common empirical models of solar coronal plasmas indicate that these weak SRBs originate from a heliocentric distance of ∼1.1–6.1 RS (the solar radius), a typical solar wind acceleration region with a low-β plasma, and that their sources have a typical motion velocity of ∼vA (Alfvén velocity) obviously lower than that of the fast electrons required to effectively excite SRBs. We propose that solitary kinetic Alfvén waves with kinetic scales could be responsible for the generation of these small-scale weak SRBs, called solitary wave radiation.

总结: 通过对16个cool core星系团和星系团组成的样本进行研究，发现30%–38%的星系团/组中存在着超过45°的错位现象。研究排除了投影效应和环境扰动对错位的主要影响，发现了更倾向于较大错位（约90°）而非较小错位（45° ≤ ΔΨ ≤ 70°）的趋势，并且发现了喷流方向改变可能发生在1到几十兆年的时间尺度内。研究得出结论，错位更有可能与喷流轴的实际重新定位有关，讨论了几种可能导致这些显著变化的引擎机制。 <br /><br />总结: <div>
Recent observations of galaxy clusters and groups with misalignments between their central active galactic nucleus jets and X-ray cavities, or with multiple misaligned cavities, have raised concerns about the jet–bubble connection in cooling cores, and the processes responsible for jet realignment. To investigate the frequency and causes of such misalignments, we construct a sample of 16 cool core galaxy clusters and groups. Using Very Long Baseline Array radio data, we measure the parsec-scale position angle of the jets, and compare it with the position angle of the X-ray cavities detected in Chandra data. Using the overall sample and selected subsets, we consistently find that there is a 30%–38% chance to find a misalignment larger than ΔΨ = 45° when observing a cluster/group with a detected jet and at least one cavity. We determine that projection may account for an apparently large ΔΨ only in a fraction of objects (∼35%), and given that gas dynamical disturbances (such as sloshing) are found in both aligned and misaligned systems, we exclude environmental perturbation as the main driver of cavity–jet misalignment. Moreover, we find that large misalignments (up to ∼90°) are favored over smaller ones (45° ≤ ΔΨ ≤ 70°), and that the change in jet direction can occur on timescales between one and a few tens of Myr. We conclude that misalignments are more likely related to actual reorientation of the jet axis, and we discuss several engine-based mechanisms that may cause these dramatic changes.

这篇文章报告了对A3444和MS1455.0+2232两个星系团进行的射电和X射线研究。在A3444中发现射电迷你晕集中在冷核心内，但在中心以西380千秒差距处检测到一个更微弱的延伸。使用查德拉，检测到四个X射线冷前缘，其中第四个位于距中心400千秒差距的地方，与射电延伸部分相吻合，这表明星系中介质在较大的范围内发生了搅动。对MS 1455.0+2232也发现类似的情况，射电迷你晕与冷前缘相关。A3444的射电光谱呈幂律分布，指数为1.0 ± 0.1，随着距中心的增加而陡峭，这与星系中介质的搅动导致相对论粒子再加速的预期相吻合。<br /><br />总结: 本文介绍了两个星系团的射线和X射线研究发现，射电迷你晕在冷核心内，但在特定范围外延伸，这与X射线冷前缘相关。这表明星系中介质的搅动可能与射电迷你晕的形成相关。 <div>
We present radio and X-ray studies of A3444 and MS1455.0+2232, two galaxy clusters with radio minihalos in their cool cores. A3444 is imaged using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at 333, 607, and 1300 MHz and the Very Large Array at 1435 MHz. Most of the minihalo is contained within r &lt; 120 kpc, but a fainter extension, stretching out to 380 kpc southwest of the center, is detected at 607 MHz. Using Chandra, we detect four X-ray sloshing cold fronts: three in the cool core at r = 60, 120, and 230 kpc, and a fourth one at r = 400 kpc—in the region of the southwestern radio extension—suggesting that the intracluster medium (ICM) is sloshing on a cluster-wide scale. The radio emission is contained within the envelope defined by these fronts. We also analyzed archival 383 MHz GMRT and Chandra observations of MS 1455.0+2232, which exhibits a known minihalo with its bright part delineated by cold fronts inside the cool core, but with a faint extension beyond the core. Similarly to A3444, we find a cold front at r ∼ 425 kpc, containing the radio emission. Thus the entire diffuse radio emission seen in these clusters appears to be related to large-scale sloshing of the ICM. The radio spectrum of the A3444 minihalo is a power law with a steep index α = 1.0 ± 0.1. The spectrum steepens with increasing distance from the center, as expected if the minihalo originates from reacceleration of relativistic particles by the sloshing-induced turbulence in the ICM.

JWST观测了SN Ia宿主星系NGC 7250、NGC 4536和NGC 3972，首次使用JWST研究了JAGB方法。研究表明，JAGB星在外部盘中的测光效果最佳，新方法可以系统地选择外部盘。JAGB星在色-星等空间与其他恒星群明显分离，观测到的离散度与2MASS数据中在LMC中观测到的JAGB星的分散度相似。JWST观测的JAGB星清晰地展示了它们作为高精度外星距离指示器和SN Ia超新星校准器的实力。 
<br /><br />总结: <br /> JAGB方法是一个标准光源，利用红外波段1.2μm测量的颜色选择的碳星AGB星的恒定光度。通过JWST观测的NGC 7250、NGC 4536和NGC 3972，首次使用JWST研究了JAGB方法。新方法通过系统选择外部盘，发现JAGB星在色-星等空间与其他恒星群明显分离，且观测到的离散度与LMC中观测到的JAGB星的分散度相似。JWST观测的JAGB星清晰地展示了它们作为高精度外星距离指示器和SN Ia超新星校准器的实力。 <div>
The J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) method is a standard candle that leverages the constant luminosities of color-selected, carbon-rich AGB stars, measured in the near-infrared at 1.2 μm. The Chicago-Carnegie Hubble Program has obtained JWST imaging of the SN Ia host galaxies NGC 7250, NGC 4536, and NGC 3972. With these observations, the JAGB method can be studied for the first time using JWST. Lee et al. demonstrated the JAGB magnitude is optimally measured in the outer disks of galaxies, because in the inner regions the JAGB magnitude can vary significantly due to a confluence of reddening, blending, and crowding effects. However, determining where the “outer disk” lies can be subjective. Therefore, we introduce a novel method for systematically selecting the outer disk. In a given galaxy, the JAGB magnitude is first separately measured in concentric regions, and the “outer disk” is then defined as the first radial bin where the JAGB magnitude stabilizes to a few hundredths of a magnitude. After successfully employing this method in our JWST galaxy sample, we find the JAGB stars are well segregated from other stellar populations in color–magnitude space, and have observed dispersions about their individual F115W modes of σN7250 = 0.32 mag, σN4536 = 0.34 mag, and σN3972 = 0.35 mag. These measured dispersions are similar to the scatter measured for the JAGB stars in the LMC using 2MASS data (σ = 0.33 mag). In conclusion, the JAGB stars as observed with JWST clearly demonstrate their considerable power both as high-precision extragalactic distance indicators and as SN Ia supernova calibrators.

<title>Formation of Massive Black Holes with M = (103–108) M
               ⊙ at Pre-quasar Epochs through Hoyle–Lyttleton–Bondi Accretion of Self-interacting Dark Matter onto a Moving Seed</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The presence of supermassive black holes with M ∼ 109M⊙ hosted by the luminous quasars at cosmological redshift z ≥ 6 is still an open problem in astrophysical cosmology. Here we study the formation of massive black holes at high redshift (z ≫ 7) through Hoyle–Lyttleton–Bondi accretion of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) onto a 20 M⊙ seed black hole moving with a velocity ∼100 km s−1 inside the short, mean-free path region of an SIDM halo. We consider observational constraints on a specific SIDM cross section, σ/mdm = (0.1–5) cm2 g−1. Formation timescale of massive black holes with M = (103–108) M⊙ is calculated for the universal Navarro–Frenk–White (NFW) profile, singular isothermal sphere (SIS), other power-law profiles with a cusp index 2.19 ≤ γ ≤ 2.5 of accreted dark matter, and modified-core isothermal profiles. The ambient sound speed is taken as Cs = (10–100) km s−1. It is found that an NFW profile with halo concentration C = 4.75–32.58 estimated at z = 20 and 30 for halo masses M200 = (1012–1014) M⊙ favors formation of massive black holes with M = (103–108) M⊙ at high redshift, well before quasar epoch. In this profile, these black holes grow within timescales (0.1–69) Myr at z = 16–20. For the SIS profile, the black hole formation timescales are short compared to NFW. For power-law profiles, massive black holes with M = (106–108) M⊙ grow within a few tens to 100 Myr (z = 5–30). For modified-core isothermal profiles, the timescale of massive black hole formation is in the range (0.79–464.08) Myr (z = 8–30).

在这项研究中，研究人员通过测量95个类星体样本的g和i光度带之间的滞后时间，研究了吸积盘尺寸与类星体性质之间的关系。他们发现样本中存在一些比Shakura和Sunyaev模型预测的延迟时间更长或更短的情况，这需要解释。研究还探讨了不同波长对漫射广谱线区（BLR）污染的影响，并发现了与红移范围密切相关的一些特性。此外，研究人员还发现了一些与先前研究相矛盾的结果，如在他们的样本中并未检测到连续谱和BLR滞后之间的显著相关性。最后，他们得出结论认为，漫射BLR对滞后的影响不太可能是由于鲍德温效应，而更可能是由于低亮度活动星系核中连续谱滞后时间的反相关性。 <br /><br />总结: 在这项研究中，研究人员研究了吸积盘尺寸与类星体性质之间的关系，并发现了一些令人意外的结果。他们还探讨了不同波长的影响以及与漫射BLR的关联性，并得出结论认为，连续谱滞后时间的反相关性可能不是由于鲍德温效应。另外，他们还提出了一些模型来解释这些现象。 <div>
This work studies the relationship between accretion-disk size and quasar properties, using a sample of 95 quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping Project with measured lags between the g and i photometric bands. Our sample includes disk lags that are both longer and shorter than predicted by the Shakura and Sunyaev model, requiring explanations that satisfy both cases. Although our quasars each have one lag measurement, we explore the wavelength-dependent effects of diffuse broad-line region (BLR) contamination through our sample’s broad redshift range, 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 1.2. We do not find significant evidence of variable diffuse Fe ii and Balmer nebular emission in the rms spectra, nor from Anderson–Darling tests of quasars in redshift ranges with and without diffuse nebular emission falling in the observed-frame filters. Contrary to previous work, we do not detect a significant correlation between the measured continuum and BLR lags in our luminous quasar sample, similarly suggesting that our continuum lags are not dominated by diffuse nebular emission. Similar to other studies, we find that quasars with larger-than-expected continuum lags have lower 3000 Å luminosities, and we additionally find longer continuum lags with lower X-ray luminosities and black hole masses. Our lack of evidence for diffuse BLR contribution to the lags indicates that the anticorrelation between continuum lag and luminosity is not likely to be due to the Baldwin effect. Instead, these anticorrelations favor models in which the continuum lag increases in lower-luminosity active galactic nuclei, including scenarios featuring magnetic coupling between the accretion disk and X-ray corona, and/or ripples or rims in the disk.

总结:<br /><br /> 这项研究针对质量为100到200太阳质量的旋转原始恒星进行了新的演化模型计算。他们考虑了恒星自转、脉动驱动的质量损失和辐射风等因素，并和初始金属丰度Z = 0和Z = 0.0002进行了比较。他们发现部分模型会在引力波不稳定阶段产生成功的伽马射线爆发（GRB），而另一部分模型则会直接坍缩成黑洞，产生喷射驱动的超新星事件。这些研究成果有望帮助我们更好地理解恒星演化和宇宙中的GRB和黑洞形成，对于探索宇宙中的恒星形成和演化具有重要意义。 <div>
We calculate new evolutionary models of rotating primordial very massive stars, with initial mass from 100 M⊙ to 200 M⊙, for two values of the initial metallicity Z = 0 and Z = 0.0002. For the first time in this mass range, we consider stellar rotation and pulsation-driven mass loss, along with radiative winds. The models evolve from the zero-age main sequence until the onset of pair-instability. We discuss the main properties of the models during their evolution and then focus on the final fate and the possible progenitors of jet-driven events. All tracks that undergo pulsational-pair instability produce successful gamma-ray bursts (GRB) in the collapsar framework, while those that collapse directly to black holes (BH) produce jet-driven supernova events. In these latter cases, the expected black hole mass changes due to the jet propagation inside the progenitor, resulting in different models that should produce BH within the pair-instability black hole mass gap. Successful GRBs predicted here from zero metallicity, and very metal-poor progenitors, may be bright enough to be detected even up to redshift ∼20 using current telescopes such as the Swift-BAT X-ray detector and the JWST.

<title>Dynamical Stellar Mass-to-light Ratio Gradients: Evidence for Very Centrally Concentrated IMF Variations in ETGs?</title>

<div> 关键词：初始质量函数，早期星系，Schwarzschild 模型，星际物质，动力学证据<br />
总结:<br />
这篇文章讨论了对大质量早期星系（ETGs）初始质量函数（IMF）的不同探测方法所得到的结果存在矛盾。研究构建了Schwarzschild模型，使用MUSE和SINFONI观测，发现了动力学证据表明ETGs的质量光比率ϒ向中心增加。研究发现恒定ϒ模型可能会高估星系的质量。在大多数情况下，总动力学质量最小值出现在大约1千光年处，并且对IMF的监管提供最强的限制。在主体区域，发现了类似于银河系的IMF，而在中心区域，发现了具有增加质量归一化的区域，但比之前的研究所暗示的要温和一些，仍然指向了类似于Salpeter IMF的情况。 <div>
Evidence from different probes of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) of massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) has repeatedly converged on IMFs more bottom heavy than in the Milky Way (MW). This consensus has come under scrutiny due to often contradictory results from different methods on the level of individual galaxies. In particular, a number of strong lensing probes are ostensibly incompatible with a non-MW IMF. Radial gradients of the IMF—related to gradients of the stellar mass-to-light ratio ϒ—can potentially resolve this issue. We construct Schwarzschild models allowing for ϒ-gradients in seven massive ETGs with MUSE and SINFONI observations. We find dynamical evidence that ϒ increases toward the center for all ETGs. The gradients are confined to subkiloparsec scales. Our results suggest that constant-ϒ models may overestimate the stellar mass of galaxies by up to a factor of 1.5. For all except one galaxy, we find a radius where the total dynamical mass has a minimum. This minimum places the strongest constraints on the IMF outside the center and appears at roughly 1 kpc. We consider the IMF at this radius characteristic for the main body of each ETG. In terms of the IMF mass-normalization α relative to a Kroupa IMF, we find on average an MW-like IMF 〈αmain〉 = 1.03 ± 0.19. In the centers, we find concentrated regions with increased mass normalizations that are less extreme than previous studies suggested, but still point to a Salpeter-like IMF, 〈αcen〉 = 1.54 ± 0.15.

总结: 本研究使用Dark Energy Survey (DES)的数据进行了对太阳系至0.3至2Mpc外淡淡星系的系统广域搜索。搜索并未发现新的外围星系，但发现了一候选矮星系，距离为2.2Mpc，可能是地方星系NGC 55的卫星。该矮星系具有极低的表面亮度和巨大的扩散，表明可能受到其宿主的潮汐相互作用的影响。通过合成星系，研究得出了对于距离在0.3至2.0Mpc处的矮星系的检测效率，并且估计了发现的候选矮星系的绝对视星等和半光半径。 <div>
We report results from a systematic wide-area search for faint dwarf galaxies at heliocentric distances from 0.3 to 2 Mpc using the full 6 yr of data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). Unlike previous searches over the DES data, this search specifically targeted a field population of faint galaxies located beyond the Milky Way virial radius. We derive our detection efficiency for faint, resolved dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume with a set of synthetic galaxies and expect our search to be complete to MV ∼ (−7, −10) mag for galaxies at D = (0.3, 2.0) Mpc. We find no new field dwarfs in the DES footprint, but we report the discovery of one high-significance candidate dwarf galaxy at a distance of {2.2}_{-0.12}^{+0.05}\,\mathrm{Mpc}, a potential satellite of the Local Volume galaxy NGC 55, separated by 47′ (physical separation as small as 30 kpc). We estimate this dwarf galaxy to have an absolute V-band magnitude of -{8.0}_{-0.3}^{+0.5}\,\mathrm{mag} and an azimuthally averaged physical half-light radius of {2.2}_{-0.4}^{+0.5}\,\mathrm{kpc}, making this one of the lowest surface brightness galaxies ever found with \mu =32.3\,\mathrm{mag}\,{\mathrm{arcsec}}^{-2}. This is the largest, most diffuse galaxy known at this luminosity, suggesting possible tidal interactions with its host.

总结: <br />
本研究观察到了与电子涡旋相关的亚离子尺度磁隆（MHu)与DF的关联，通过加强磁场的三个分量。MHu中存在径向电场，显示双极变化，主要归因于电子对流项。在MHu前部，存在明显的能量转换（J·E∼−0.3 nW m−3），伴随着电磁能量的流入和流出。DF的其他区域存在相反的能量转换。此外，MHu中还观察到了宽带平行的静电波。这些发现为我们提供了对DF的动力尺度过程的洞察。<br /><br /> <div>
As the plasma boundary between two distinct plasma populations, dipolarization fronts (DFs) host abundant kinetic-scale substructures that change their normal directions and thus cause their deformation. However, studies on such deformation caused by an electron vortex have been lacking. Here, we present novel observations of a subion-scale magnetic hump (MHu) associated with an oblique electron vortex at a DF through strengthening three components of the magnetic field. A radial electric field in the MHu, showing bipolar variation, is also associated with the electron vortex as it is mainly ascribed to the electron convection term. There is apparent energy conversion (\overrightarrow{J}\cdot \overrightarrow{E}∼−0.3 nw m−3) from the particles to the electromagnetic field in the MHu’s leading part, which is accompanied by inflow and outflow of electromagnetic energy (nonzero {\rm{\nabla }}\cdot \overrightarrow{S}). The other regions of the DF host opposite energy conversion (\overrightarrow{J}\cdot \overrightarrow{E} &gt; 0). Broadband parallel electrostatic waves are also observed in the MHu. Our study provides insights into the kinetic-scale processes at DFs.

本文对太阳型恒星的软X射线耀斑进行了统计研究。使用了Chandra Source Catalog Release 2.0和Gaia Data Release 3等数据源，开发了一套方法来识别和分类恒星软X射线耀斑并估算其特性。主要结果包括：耀斑能量范围在10^33到10^37之间，大多数为超级耀斑，并且发现耀斑持续时间与能量呈正相关关系；恒星耀斑能量的频率分布与其他波段和其他类型的恒星相似，表明软X射线波段辐射机制可能是全波段辐射能量的恒定分数。 <div>
The statistical characteristics of stellar flares at optical bands have received extensive study, but they remain to be studied at soft X-ray bands, in particular for solar-type stars. Here, we present a statistical study of soft X-ray flares on solar-type stars, which can help in understanding the multiwavelength behaviors of stellar flares. We mainly use Chandra Source Catalog Release 2.0, which includes a number of flaring stars with denoted variability, and Gaia Data Release 3, which includes the necessary information for classifying stars. We also develop a set of methods for identifying and classifying stellar soft X-ray flares and estimating their properties. A detailed statistical investigation of 129 flare samples on 103 nearby solar-type stars as selected yields the following main results. (1) The flare energy emitted at the soft X-ray band in our sample ranges from ∼1033 to ∼1037 erg, and the majority of them are superflares, with the most energetic one having energy of {6.0}_{-4.7}^{+3.2}\times {10}^{37}\ \mathrm{erg}. (2) The flare duration is related to its energy as formulated by {T}_{\mathrm{duration},\mathrm{SXR}}\propto {E}_{\mathrm{flare},\mathrm{SXR}}^{\ 0.201\pm 0.024}, which is different from those derived at optical and near-IR bands, indicating distinct radiation mechanisms at different bands. (3) The frequency distribution of stellar flares as a function of energy is formulated as {{dN}}_{\mathrm{flare}}/{{dE}}_{\mathrm{flare},\mathrm{SXR}}\propto {E}_{\mathrm{flare},\mathrm{SXR}}^{\ -1.77}, which is similar to the results found at other bands and on other types of stars, indicating that the energy emitted at the soft X-ray band could be a constant fraction of the full-band bolometric energy.

研究利用13CO谱学数据从GRS、FUGIN和SEDIGSM调查中与银河系涡旋臂相关的六个巨型丝状结构中的磁场结构，采用速度梯度技术（VGT）。与尘埃极化发射不同，VGT允许我们使用速度信息来区分前景和背景，并可可靠地确定磁场的方向。大多数情况下，我们发现磁场与丝状结构保持一致，并与盘面平行。所得的结果暗示银河剪切可能塑造了这些丝状结构。磁场在我们分析的分辨率下可以保持正常方向，这表明即使在湍流通过时间短于剪切时间的情况下，湍流运动也不能有效地破坏磁场的规则定向。在一些丝状结构中发现的间断可能是由包括丝状结构重组、引力坍缩和恒星反馈在内的过程所引起的。

We study the magnetic field structures in six giant filaments associated with the spiral arms of the Milky Way by applying the velocity gradient technique (VGT) to the 13CO spectroscopic data from the GRS, FUGIN, and SEDIGSM surveys. Unlike dust-polarized emission, the VGT allows us to separate the foreground and background using the velocity information, from which the orientation of the magnetic field can be reliably determined. We find that in most cases the magnetic fields stay aligned with the filament bodies, which are parallel to the disk midplane. Among these, G29, G47, and G51 exhibit smooth magnetic fields, and G24, G339, and G349 exhibit discontinuities. The fact that most filaments have magnetic fields that stay aligned with the Galactic disk midplane suggests that Galactic shear may be responsible for shaping the filaments. The fact that the magnetic field can stay regular at the resolution of our analysis (≲10 pc), where the turbulence crossing time is short compared to the shear time, suggests that turbulent motion cannot effectively disrupt the regular orientation of the magnetic field. The discontinuities found in some filaments can be caused by processes including filament reassembly, gravitational collapse, and stellar feedback.

<title>ALMA Survey of Orion Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (ALMASOP): Discovery of an Extremely Dense and Compact Object Embedded in the Prestellar Core G208.68-19.92-N2</title>

<div> Prestellar core, Filamentary structure, Nucleus, Density, CO depletion

总结:
在Orion分子云3（OMC-3）区域内研究了G208-N2前恒星核的内部结构。通过Atacama大型毫米/亚毫米阵列，发现尘埃连续辐射呈丝状结构，长度约5000天文单位，平均H2体积密度约为6×107cm−3。在丝状结构的顶端发现一个半径约150-200天文单位，质量约为0.1太阳质量的核心。核心的中心密度约为2×109cm−3，径向密度剖面为r−1.87±0.11。该核心的密度缩放约为奇异等温球体（SIS）的3.7倍，这以及非常低的维里参数0.39表明重力在核心内部处于主导地位。然而，没有CO流的迹象局限在这个核心区域内。丝状结构由N2D+ 3-2发射追踪，但不是由C18O 2-1发射追踪，这意味着由于高密度和低温度而导致显著的CO耗尽。指向核心的N2D+也显示出衰减的特征。这可能意味着父分子N2的耗竭，或者存在着能够使CO在非常小的区域升华的内嵌非常低辐射的中心源。G208-N2中的核心被认为是处于首次静水压核（FHSC）形成边缘的前恒星核，或者是FHSC的候选者。 <div>
The internal structure of the prestellar core G208.68-19.02-N2 (G208-N2) in the Orion Molecular Cloud 3 (OMC-3) region has been studied with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The dust continuum emission revealed a filamentary structure with a length of ∼5000 au and an average H2 volume density of ∼6 × 107 cm−3. At the tip of this filamentary structure, there is a compact object, which we call a nucleus, with a radius of ∼150–200 au and a mass of ∼0.1 M⊙. The nucleus has a central density of ∼2 × 109 cm−3 with a radial density profile of r−1.87±0.11. The density scaling of the nucleus is ∼3.7 times higher than that of the singular isothermal sphere (SIS). This as well as the very low virial parameter of 0.39 suggests that the gravity is dominant over the pressure everywhere in the nucleus. However, there is no sign of CO outflow localized to this nucleus. The filamentary structure is traced by the N2D+ 3–2 emission, but not by the C18O 2–1 emission, implying the significant CO depletion due to high density and cold temperature. Toward the nucleus, the N2D+ also shows the signature of depletion. This could imply either the depletion of the parent molecule, N2, or the presence of the embedded very-low luminosity central source that could sublimate the CO in the very small area. The nucleus in G208-N2 is considered to be a prestellar core on the verge of first hydrostatic core (FHSC) formation or a candidate for the FHSC.

<div> 关键词: RP chondrules, 实验再现, DFe, mesostasis glass, 铁金属包裹体<br />
总结:<br />
这篇文章利用气流悬浮系统在还原大气中进行了RP球粒的再现实验，发现自然RP球粒中的铁分配系数DFe要高于实验再现的结果，表明在高温下球粒形成后，玻璃基质中的铁被移除。实验中发现玻璃基质中形成了许多小的铁金属包裹体，证实了自然RP球粒中DFe增加的过程。因此，RP球粒的DFe可以用来限制球粒形成过程中的冷却速率和氧化还原状态。 <div>
Reproduction experiments of radial pyroxene (RP) chondrules were carried out using an Ar–H2 or Ar gas-jet levitation system in a reducing atmosphere in order to simulate chondrule formation in the protoplanetary disk. The experiments reproduced RP-chondrule textures, consisting of sets of thin pyroxene crystals and mesostasis glass between crystals. However, iron partition coefficients between pyroxene and glassy mesostasis (DFe =Fe mol%pyroxene/Fe mol%mesostasis) in natural RP chondrules were much higher than that in the experimentally reproduced RP chondrules. The high DFe in natural RP chondrules suggests that iron was removed from the mesostasis melt at high temperatures after the growth of pyroxene crystals. We found that many small iron-metal inclusions had formed in the mesostasis glass, indicating that FeO in the high-temperature melt of mesostasis was reduced to metallic iron, and iron in the mesostasis diffused into the newly formed metal inclusions. The formation of the iron-metal inclusions in the mesostasis was reproduced by our experiments in a reducing atmosphere, confirming that DFe in natural RP chondrules increased after the growth of RP crystals. Therefore, the DFe of RP chondrules can be an indicator to constrain cooling rates and redox states during chondrule formation.

<br /><br />
总结: 该研究使用Cloudy模拟了氧、氖等物种的禁区线排放，以追踪原行星盘的风。他们采用了参数化的磁热风模型，这些模型在一定程度上与光蒸发和磁离心风的特征相似，且受到了近期理论研究的青睐。他们发现，可行的风参数可以产生线的宽窄低速成分，而传统的风模型往往难以做到这一点。此外，线的亮度、蓝移、宽度以及这些随着吸积光度和盘倾角的趋势与观测结果一致。 <div>
Emission in forbidden lines of oxygen, neon, and other species are commonly used to trace winds from protoplanetary disks. Using Cloudy, we calculate such emission for parametrized wind models of the magnetothermal type, following Bai et al. These models share characteristics with both photoevaporative and magnetocentrifugal winds, which can be regarded as end members, and are favored by recent theoretical research. Both broad and narrow low-velocity components of the lines can be produced with plausible wind parameters, something that traditional wind models have difficulty with. Line luminosities, blueshifts, and widths, as well as trends of these with accretion luminosity and disk inclination, are in general accordance with observations.

通过对90个年轻移动星团、昴星团和母牛座中的晚期M型和L型矮星进行低分辨率近红外光谱和BT-Settl模型大气的统一前向建模分析，研究了这些矮星的有效温度、表面重力、半径和质量。得到的观测参数与基于演化模型计算得到的参数存在系统性偏差，特别是在M-L谱型边界附近的物体。研究发现模型光谱有过度预测J-和H-带的峰值流量，表明模型大气中包含的尘埃含量不足以匹配观测。通过在BT-Settl模型光谱中引入类似于星际介质的红化定律，发现模型和观测谱的拟合得到了很大改善，而M-L转变处的红化系数最大。这项工作对BT-Settl模型大气进行了系统的研究，是迄今为止最大的Late-M和L型棕矮星的光谱分析。 
<br /><br />总结: Late-M和L型矮星通过低分辨率近红外光谱和BT-Settl模型大气的前向建模进行了详细分析。观测参数与基于演化模型计算得到的参数存在系统性偏差，尤其是在M-L谱型边界处。对模型光谱引入红化定律可以极大改善模型和观测谱的拟合，表明模型大气中的尘埃含量不足以匹配观测。这项工作是对BT-Settl模型大气最大的系统研究，也是迄今为止最大的Late-M和L型棕矮星的光谱分析。 <div>
We present a uniform forward-modeling analysis of 90 late-M and L dwarfs in nearby young (∼10–200 Myr) moving groups, the Pleiades, and the Hyades using low-resolution (R ≈ 150) near-infrared (0.9–2.4 μm) spectra and the BT-Settl model atmospheres. We derive the objects’ effective temperatures, surface gravities, radii, and masses by comparing our spectra to the models using a Bayesian framework with nested sampling and calculate the same parameters using evolutionary models. Assuming the evolutionary-based parameters are more robust, our spectroscopically inferred parameters from BT-Settl exhibit two types of systematic behavior for objects near the M-L spectral type boundary. Several objects are clustered around Teff ≈ 1800 K and \mathrm{log}g\approx 5.5 dex, implying impossibly large masses (150–1400 MJup), while others are clustered around Teff ≳ 3000 K and \mathrm{log}g\lesssim 3.0 dex, implying unphysically low masses and unreasonably young ages. We find the fitted BT-Settl model spectra tend to overpredict the peak J- and H-band flux for objects located near the M-L boundary, suggesting the dust content included in the model atmospheres is insufficient to match the observations. By adding an interstellar medium–like reddening law to the BT-Settl model spectra, we find the fits between models and observed spectra are greatly improved, with the largest reddening coefficients occurring at the M-L transition. This work delivers a systematic examination of the BT-Settl model atmospheres and constitutes the largest spectral analysis of benchmark late-M- and L-type brown dwarfs to date.

总结:<br />
研究了位于z = 4.3的高红移星系团SPT2349−56，通过射电观测探测到了其中的射电活动星系核（AGN）。AGN的射电亮度远高于预期，表明其可能受到形成最亮星系团星系的驱动。与其他样本和高红移强射电星系相比较结果。研究发现，射电活动AGN可能给星系团内介质提供了强大的反馈作用。 <div>
We have observed the z = 4.3 protocluster SPT2349−56 with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) with the aim of detecting radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) among the ∼30 submillimeter (submm) galaxies (SMGs) identified in the structure. We detect the central complex of submm sources at 2.2 GHz with a luminosity of L2.2  = (4.42 ± 0.56)  ×  1025 W Hz−1. MeerKAT and the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder also detect the source at 816 MHz and 888 MHz, respectively, constraining the radio spectral index to α = −1.45 ± 0.16, implying L1.4,rest  = (2.2 ± 0.2) × 1026 W Hz−1. The radio observations do not have sufficient spatial resolution to uniquely identify one of the three Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) galaxies as the AGN, however the ALMA source properties themselves suggest a likely host. This radio luminosity is ∼100× higher than expected from star formation, assuming the usual far-infrared–radio correlation, indicating an AGN driven by a forming brightest cluster galaxy. None of the SMGs in SPT2349−56 show signs of AGNs in any other diagnostics available to us, highlighting the radio continuum as a powerful probe of obscured AGNs. We compare these results to field samples of radio sources and SMGs, along with the 22 gravitationally lensed SPT-SMGs also observed in the ATCA program, as well as powerful radio galaxies at high redshifts. The (3.3 ± 0.7) ×  1038 W of power from the radio-loud AGN sustained over 100 Myr is comparable to the binding energy of the gas mass of the central halo, and similar to the instantaneous energy injection from supernova feedback from the SMGs in the core region. The SPT2349−56 radio-loud AGNs may be providing strong feedback on a nascent intracluster medium.

<title>KilonovAE: Exploring Kilonova Spectral Features with Autoencoders</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Kilonovae are likely a key site of heavy r-process element production in the Universe, and their optical/infrared spectra contain insights into both the properties of the ejecta and the conditions of the r-process. However, the event GW170817/AT2017gfo is the only kilonova so far with well-observed spectra. To understand the diversity of absorption features that might be observed in future kilonovae spectra, we use the TARDIS Monte Carlo radiative transfer code to simulate a suite of optical spectra spanning a wide range of kilonova ejecta properties and r-process abundance patterns. To identify the most common and prominent absorption lines, we perform dimensionality reduction using an autoencoder, and we find spectra clusters in the latent space representation using a Bayesian Gaussian Mixture model. Our synthetic kilonovae spectra commonly display strong absorption by strontium 38Sr ii, yttrium 38Y ii, and zirconium 40Zr i–ii, with strong lanthanide contributions at low electron fractions (Ye ≲ 0.25). When a new kilonova is observed, our machine-learning framework will provide context on the dominant absorption lines and key ejecta properties, helping to determine where this event falls within the larger “zoo” of kilonovae spectra.

<title>A Census of Star Formation Histories of Massive Galaxies at 0.6 < z <  1 from Spectrophotometric Modeling Using Bagpipes and Prospector</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present individual star formation histories (SFHs) of ∼3000 massive galaxies (log(M*/M⊙) &gt; 10.5) from the Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census spectroscopic survey at a lookback time of ∼7 billion yr and quantify the population trends leveraging 20 hr deep-integrated spectra of these ∼1800 star-forming and ∼1200 quiescent galaxies at 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.0. Essentially all galaxies at this epoch contain stars of age &lt;3 Gyr, in contrast with older massive galaxies today, facilitating better recovery of previous generations of star formation at cosmic noon and earlier. We conduct spectrophotometric analysis using parametric and nonparametric Bayesian stellar population synthesis modeling tools—Bagpipes and Prospector—to constrain the median SFHs of this mass complete sample and characterize population trends. A consistent picture arises for the late-time stellar mass growth when quantified as t50 and t90, corresponding to the age of the Universe when galaxies formed 50% and 90% of their total stellar mass, although the two methods disagree at the earliest formation times (e.g., t10). Our results reveal trends in both stellar mass and stellar velocity dispersion as in the local Universe—low-mass galaxies with shallower potential wells grow their stellar masses later in cosmic history compared to high-mass galaxies. Unlike local quiescent galaxies, the median duration of late-time star formation (τSF,late = t90–t50) does not consistently depend on the stellar mass. This census sets a benchmark for future deep spectrophotometric studies of the more distant Universe.

<title>Magnetic Fields of the Starless Core L 1512</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present JCMT POL-2 850 μm dust polarization observations and Mimir H-band stellar polarization observations toward the starless core L 1512. We detect the highly ordered core-scale magnetic field traced by the POL-2 data, of which the field orientation is consistent with the parsec-scale magnetic fields traced by Planck data, suggesting the large-scale fields thread from the low-density region to the dense core region in this cloud. The surrounding magnetic field traced by the Mimir data shows a wider variation in the field orientation, suggesting there could be a transition of magnetic field morphology at the envelope-scale. L 1512 was suggested to be presumably older than 1.4 Myr in a previous study via time-dependent chemical analysis, hinting that the magnetic field could be strong enough to slow the collapse of L 1512. In this study, we use the Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi method to derive a plane-of-sky magnetic field strength (Bpos) of 18 ± 7 μG and an observed mass-to-flux ratio (λobs) of 3.5 ± 2.4, suggesting that L 1512 is magnetically supercritical. However, the absence of significant infall motion and the presence of an oscillating envelope are inconsistent with the magnetically supercritical condition. Using a virial analysis, we suggest the presence of a hitherto hidden line-of-sight magnetic field strength of ∼27 μG with a mass-to-flux ratio (λtot) of ∼1.6, in which case both magnetic and kinetic pressures are important in supporting the L 1512 core. On the other hand, L 1512 may have just reached supercriticality and will collapse at any time.

<title>Testing the Polarization of Gravitational-wave Background with the LISA-TianQin Network</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
While general relativity predicts only two tensor modes for gravitational-wave (GW) polarization, general metric theories of gravity allow for up to four additional modes, including two vector and two scalar modes. Observing the polarization modes of GWs could provide a direct test of the modified gravity. The stochastic GW background (SGWB), which can be detected by space-based laser-interferometric detectors at design sensitivity, will provide an opportunity to directly measure alternative polarization. In this paper, we investigate the performance of the LISA-TianQin network for detecting alternative polarizations of stochastic backgrounds, and propose a method to separate different polarization modes. First, we generalize the small antenna approximation to compute the overlap reduction functions for the SGWB with arbitrary polarization, which is suitable for any time-delay interferometry combination. Then we analyze the detection capability of LISA-TianQin for the SGWB with different polarizations. Based on the orbital characteristics of LISA-TianQin, we propose a method to distinguish different polarization modes from their mixed data. Finally, simulation tests are performed to verify the effectiveness of the method. The results of the simulations demonstrate that LISA-TianQin, when employing our proposed method, has the ability to differentiate between various polarization modes, with a specific emphasis on the ability to distinguish between the breathing and longitudinal modes.

<title>Atmospheric Escape From Three Terrestrial Planets in the L 98-59 System</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A critically important process affecting the climate evolution and potential habitability of an exoplanet is atmospheric escape, in which high-energy radiation from a star drives the escape of hydrogen atoms and other light elements from a planet’s atmosphere. L 98-59 is a benchmark system for studying such atmospheric processes, with three transiting terrestrial-sized planets receiving Venus-like instellations (4–25 S⊕) from their M3 host star. We use the VPLanet model to simulate the evolution of the L 98-59 system and the atmospheric escape of its inner three small planets, given different assumed initial water quantities. We find that, regardless of their initial water content, all three planets accumulate significant quantities of oxygen due to efficient water photolysis and hydrogen loss. All three planets also receive enough strong X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet flux to drive rapid water loss, which considerably affects their developing climates and atmospheres. Even in scenarios of low initial water content, our results suggest that the JWST will be sensitive to observations of retained oxygen on the L 98-59 planets in its future scheduled observations, with planets b and c being the most likely targets to possess an extended atmosphere. Our results constrain the atmospheric evolution of these small rocky planets, and they provide context for current and future observations of the L 98-59 system to generalize our understanding of multiterrestrial planet systems.

We have carried out a detailed study of individual pulse emission from the pulsar J2022+5154 (B2021+51), observed at 2250 MHz using the Jiamusi 66 m radio telescope. We have investigated the modulations in single-pulse behavior using fluctuation spectral analysis, which shows the presence of two prominent periodicities, around 5 and 40 rotation periods, respectively. The shorter periodicity is associated with the phenomenon of subpulse drifting. In the absence of aliasing, the emission pattern is demonstrated to consist of eight subbeams, which rotate around the magnetic axis in about 45 periods. In addition to subpulse drifting, the pulsar also shows the presence of periodic amplitude modulation with a longer periodicity in the single-pulse sequence. The pulsar joins a select group that shows the presence of periodic phase-modulated drifting as well as amplitude-modulated drifting. This provides further evidence for the two phenomena being distinct from each other with different physical origins.

<title>The Age Distribution of Stellar Orbit Space Clumps</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The orbit distribution of young stars in the Galactic disk is highly structured, from well-defined clusters to streams of stars that may be widely dispersed across the sky, but are compact in orbital action-angle space. The age distribution of such groups can constrain the timescales over which conatal groups of stars disperse into the “field.” Gaia data have proven powerful in identifying such groups in action-angle space, but the resulting member samples are often too small and have too narrow a color–magnitude diagram (CMD) coverage to allow robust age determinations. Here, we develop and illustrate a new approach that can estimate robust stellar population ages for such groups of stars. This first entails projecting the predetermined action-angle distribution into the 5D space of positions, parallaxes, and proper motions, where much larger samples of likely members can be identified over a much wider range of the CMD. It then entails isochrone fitting that accounts for: (a) widely varying distances and reddenings; (b) outliers and binaries; (c) sparsely populated main-sequence turnoffs, by incorporating the age information of the low-mass main sequence; and (d) the possible presence of an intrinsic age spread in the stellar population. When we apply this approach to 92 nearby stellar groups identified in 6D orbit space, we find that they are predominantly young (≲1 Gyr), mono-age populations. Many groups are established (known) localized clusters with possible tidal tails, while others tend to be widely dispersed and manifestly unbound. This new age-dating tool offers a stringent approach to understanding on which orbits stars form in the solar neighborhood and how quickly they disperse into the field.

<title>Recurrently Propagating Intensity Disturbances along Polar Plumes Observed in White Light and Extreme Ultraviolet</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study properties of intensity disturbances along polar coronal rays that are associated with plumes below. For this, we draw azimuth–time images of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission of 171 Å band observed by the SDO/AIA and white light (WL) observed by the SOHO/LASCO C2 in 2020 July. From the azimuth–time image, we define two tracks in which the EUV intensities were recurrently enhanced during two weeks. The two EUV tracks are rooted at 78.°8 and 81.°4 latitudes, but their projected azimuth angles are changed with time as the Sun rotates. Coherent WL tracks at different altitudes are determined by scaling the azimuth angles of the EUV tracks, accounting for the effect of inclination of coronal rays. From this, we construct time–distance images of WL intensities along WL tracks, whose projected azimuth angle changes along time and altitude, but the intensities are correlated with the EUV intensities measured below. The time–distance images of WL show repeated and inclined intensity features. The propagation speeds in the altitude range 2.3–6 solar radii are calculated to be 159 ± 8 km s−1 and 300 ± 24 km s−1. The EUV and WL intensities are found to be coherent at 1–2 day periods. It is also found that dynamic burst events along the EUV track are responsible for the enhanced emission. We conclude that the variation of the WL intensity along the polar coronal rays is related with the evolution of the EUV intensity below.

Extreme scattering events (ESEs) are observed as dramatic (&gt;50%) drops in flux density that occur over an extended period of weeks to months. Discrete plasma lensing structures are theorized to scatter the radio waves produced by distant sources such as pulsars, causing the signature decrease in flux density and characteristic caustic spikes in ESE light curves. While plasma lens models in the extant literature have reproduced key features of ESE light curves, they have all faced the problem of being highly overdense and overpressured relative to the surrounding interstellar medium by orders of magnitude. We model ESEs by numerically ray tracing through analytic, volumetric plasma lens models by solving the eikonal equation. Delaunay triangulation connecting the rays approximates the wave front, generating a mapping from the observer plane to the source plane to account for multiple imaging. This eikonal method of ray tracing is tested against known analytic solutions and is then applied to a three-dimensional Gaussian-distributed electron volume density lens and a filament model inspired by Grafton et al. We find convergence of our numerical results with established analytic solutions, validating our numerical method, and reproduce ESE-like light curves. Our numerical ray-tracing method lends itself well to exploring the lensing effects of volumetric turbulence as well as sheet-like lenses, which is currently in progress.

<title>Modeling Solar Oscillation Power Spectra. III. Spatiotemporal Spectra of Solar Granulation Velocity Field as Seen in HMI Velocity Measurements</title>

We suggest a physically motivated model of the uncorrelated background, which can be used to improve the accuracy of helioseismic frequency measurements when the background contributes significantly to the formation of spectral lines of acoustic resonances. The basic assumption of our model is that the correlation length of the convective motions is small compared with the horizontal wavelength R⊙/ℓ of the observations, where ℓ is the degree of the spherical harmonic Yℓm(θ, φ). When applied to solar power spectra at frequencies below acoustic resonances, the model reveals a distinct sensitivity to solar rotation: advection of the convective velocity pattern brings spatial correlations in the apparent stochastic velocity field (temporal correlations in the corotating frame induce spatial correlations in the inertial frame). The induced spatiotemporal correlations manifest themselves as an antisymmetric component in the dependence of the convective noise power on azimuthal order m, which allows us to address the solar differential rotation. With 360 days of data obtained by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we measure three components of the rotation rate as a function of latitude using only ℓ = 300. This result indicates that the model suggests a new way of measuring solar subsurface rotation. This approach can complement traditional measurements based on correlation tracking.

<title>Black Hole Ultracompact X-Ray Binaries as Galactic Low-frequency Gravitational Wave Sources: The He Star Channel</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Black hole (BH) ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs) are potential Galactic low-frequency gravitational wave (GW) sources. As an alternative channel, BH UCXBs can evolve from BH+He star binaries. In this work, we perform a detailed stellar evolution model for the formation and evolution of BH UCXBs evolving from the He star channel to diagnose their detectability as low-frequency GW sources. Our calculations found that some nascent BH+He star binaries after the common-envelope (CE) phase could evolve into UCXB-LISA sources with a maximum GW frequency of ∼5 mHz, which can be detected in a distance of 10 kpc (or 100 kpc). Once BH+He star systems become UCXBs through mass transfer, they would emit X-ray luminosities of ∼1038 erg s−1, making them ideal multimessenger objects. If the initial He-star masses are ≥0.7 M⊙, those systems are likely to experience two Roche lobe overflows, and the X-ray luminosity can reach a maximum of 3.5 × 1039 erg s−1 in the second mass-transfer stage. The initial He-star masses and initial orbital periods of progenitors of Galactic BH UCXB-LISA sources are in the range of 0.32–2.9 M⊙ and 0.02–0.19 days, respectively. Nearly all BH+He star binaries in the above parameter space can evolve into GW sources whose chirp masses can be accurately measured. Employing a population synthesis simulation, we predict the birthrate and detection number of Galactic BH UCXB-LISA sources evolving from the He star channel are R = 2.2 × 10−6 yr−1 and 33 for an optimistic CE parameter, respectively.

We present results from the Very Long Baseline Array multifrequency (1.6, 4.4, 8.6, and 22 GHz), high-sensitivity (∼25 μJy beam−1), subparsec-scale (&lt;1 pc) observations and spectral energy distributions for a sample of 12 local active galactic nuclei (AGNs), a subset from our previous volume-complete sample with hard-X-ray (14–195 keV) luminosities above 1042 erg s−1, out to a distance of 40 Mpc. All 12 of the sources presented here were detected in the C (4.4 GHz) and X (8.6 GHz) bands, 75% in the L band (1.6 GHz), and 50% in the K band (22 GHz). Most sources showed compact, resolved/slightly resolved, central subparsec-scale radio morphology, except for a few with extended outflow-like features. A couple of sources have an additional component that may indicate the presence of a dual-core, single or double-sided jet or a more intricate feature, such as radio emission resulting from interaction with the nearby interstellar medium. The spectral slopes are mostly gigahertz-peaked or curved, with a few showing steep, flat, or inverted spectra. We found that at the subparsec scale, the gigahertz-peaked spectra belong to the low-accreting, radio-loud AGNs, with a tendency to produce strong outflows, possibly small-scale jets, and/or have a coronal origin. In contrast, flat/inverted spectra suggest compact radio emission from the central regions of highly accreting AGNs, possibly associated with radio-quiet AGNs producing winds/shocks or nuclear star formation in the vicinity of black holes.

<title>The CO Outflow Components Ejected by a Recent Accretion Event in B335</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Protostellar outflows often present a knotty appearance, providing evidence of sporadic accretion in stellar mass growth. To understand the direct relation between mass accretion and ejection, we analyze the contemporaneous accretion activity and associated ejection components in B335. B335 has brightened in the mid-IR by 2.5 mag since 2010, indicating increased luminosity, presumably due to an increased mass accretion rate onto the protostar. Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of 12CO emission in the outflow reveal high-velocity emission, estimated to have been ejected 4.6–2 yr before the ALMA observations and consistent with the jump in mid-IR brightness. The consistency in timing suggests that the detected high-velocity ejection components are directly linked to the most recent accretion activity. We calculated the kinetic energy, momentum, and force for the ejection component associated with the most recent accretion activity and found that, at least, about 1.0% of the accreted mass has been ejected. More accurate information on the jet inclination and the temperature of the ejected gas components will better constrain the ejected mass induced by the recently enhanced accretion event.

<title>Infrared Emission of Specific Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Molecules: Cyanonaphthalenes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The unidentified infrared emission features at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3, and 12.7 μm are ubiquitously seen in a wide variety of astrophysical regions and commonly attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules. However, the unambiguous identification of any individual, specific PAH molecules has proven elusive until very recently, when two isomers of cyanonapthalene, which consists of two fused benzene rings and substitutes a nitrile (–CN) group for a hydrogen atom, were discovered in the Taurus Molecular Cloud, based on their rotational transitions at radio frequencies. To facilitate the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to search for cyanonapthalenes in astrophysical regions, we model the vibrational excitation of cyanonapthalenes and calculate their infrared emission spectra in a number of representative astrophysical regions. The model emission spectra and intensities will allow JWST to quantitatively determine or place an upper limit on the abundances of cyanonapthalenes.

<title>Polarized X-Rays Detected from the Anomalous X-Ray Pulsar 1E 2259+586</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) and soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) are believed to be associated with magnetars, which have extremely strong magnetic fields. Recently, with the operation of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), the polarization information of two AXPs and one SGR have been investigated. In this work, we report the observational results of the fourth magnetar, 1E 2259+586, with IXPE, and perform a joint analysis with observations from Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer. We find that the emission from 1E 2259+586 is linearly polarized, with a polarization degree (5.3% ± 1.3%) and a polarization angle −77° ± 7° in the 2–8 keV energy range. Additionally, both the polarization degree and polarization angle exhibit variability with the pulse phase, and there is a hint of anticorrelation between the polarization degree and the flux, which is similar to AXP 1RXS J170849.0-400910. The phase-dependent polarization angle displays a sinusoidal profile and can be well fitted with the rotating vector model, indicating that the magnetic dipole field dominated the magnetic structure of the pulsar, and the variation in the polarization angle was modulated by the pulsar’s rotation.

<div> 年轻恒星对象，尘埃输运，磁流体力学模拟，尘埃颗粒，质量流失率
总结:
年轻的0/I型恒星对象中的低尘埃不透明度谱指数（β < 1）被解释为这些环境中存在（次）毫米尘埃颗粒的迹象。密度条件和坍缩包围气壳的寿命已被证明不利于固体颗粒的生长达到毫米尺寸。作为一种替代方案，磁流体力学模拟表明原恒星喷流和流出可能会将颗粒从星周盘中抬升并扩散到包围气壳中。我们重新解释了CALYPSO样本中的0/I型源的可用数据，并展示了内部包围中测得的β1–3毫米值与其喷流和流出的质量流失率之间存在着一种负相关关系的初步证据，支持了这两者之间的联系。我们讨论了从盘到内部包围中进行尘埃输运可能对行星形成的几个方面产生的影响。最后，我们呼吁更准确地测量这些相关量，并将这项工作扩展到更大的样本中，以进一步测试这种输运情景。 <div>
Low dust opacity spectral indices (β &lt; 1) measured in the inner envelopes of class 0/I young stellar objects (age ∼104–5 yr) have been interpreted as the presence of (sub-)millimeter dust grains in these environments. The density conditions and the lifetimes of collapsing envelopes have proven unfavorable for the growth of solids up to millimeter sizes. As an alternative, magnetohydrodynamical simulations suggest that protostellar jets and outflows might lift grains from circumstellar disks and diffuse them in the envelope. We reframe available data for the CALYPSO sample of Class 0/I sources and show tentative evidence for an anticorrelation between the value of β1–3 mm measured in the inner envelope and the mass-loss rate of their jets and outflows, supporting a connection between the two. We discuss the implications that dust transport from the disk to the inner envelope might have for several aspects of planet formation. Finally, we urge for more accurate measurements of both correlated quantities and the extension of this work to larger samples, necessary to further test the transport scenario.

We present a search for host galaxy associations for the third set of repeating fast radio burst (FRB) sources discovered by the CHIME/FRB Collaboration. Using the ∼1′ CHIME/FRB baseband localizations and probabilistic methods, we identify potential host galaxies of two FRBs, 20200223B and 20190110C at redshifts of 0.06024(2) and 0.12244(6), respectively. We also discuss the properties of a third marginal candidate host galaxy association for FRB 20191106C with a host redshift of 0.10775(1). The three putative host galaxies are all relatively massive, fall on the standard mass–metallicity relationship for nearby galaxies, and show evidence of ongoing star formation. They also all show signatures of being in a transitional regime, falling in the green valley, which is between the bulk of star-forming and quiescent galaxies. The plausible host galaxies identified by our analysis are consistent with the overall population of repeating and nonrepeating FRB hosts while increasing the fraction of massive and bright galaxies. Coupled with these previous host associations, we identify a possible excess of FRB repeaters whose host galaxies have Mu − Mr colors redder than the bulk of star-forming galaxies. Additional precise localizations are required to confirm this trend.

We present an effective strategy for extensive analysis of eclipsing time variations (ETVs) using modern and sophisticated optimization methods that comprise a set of tools to investigate period variability mechanisms in eclipsing binary stars such as the light-time effect, the Applegate mechanism, and mass transfer. We implement these methods for the first time assuming that the above mechanisms can act simultaneously in the puzzling W UMa–type binary star TZ Bootis by using archival and new TESS data spanning 75 yr and reexamining the up-to-date ETVs. Preliminary analysis of the TESS data revealed for the first time the presence of a second binary in agreement with previous spectroscopic data and astrometric results from Gaia DR3. We consider the most credible scenario for the ETV: two stellar circumbinary companions of minimum masses M3 = 0.5 M☉ and M4 = 0.14 M☉ in highly eccentric orbits e3 = 0.70 and e4 = 0.82 with periods P3 = 38 yr and P4 = 20 yr along with a 24 yr magnetic activity of the secondary component and a long-term period increase (dP/dt = 1.2 × 10−8 days yr−1), interpreted as a conservative mass transfer from the secondary to the primary component at a rate of dM1/dt = 3.7 × 10−9 days yr−1. Further spectroscopic observations, analytical modeling of the second pair, and ETV analysis of both pairs are needed to investigate the quadruple nature of the system.

总结: 
本研究通过深入数据分析，提出了一种名为分形维度-逆离散小波变换（FDIDWT）的新方法，用于在大容量的天文数据中识别主动星系核（AGN）候选者和巴莱克星座对象（BL Lac）或平谱射电类星体（FSRQ）候选者。通过将原始数据转换为低维度并突出特征的转换数据集，结合使用改进的轻量级MatchboxConv1D模型，成功实现了对4FGL_DR3不确定源中AGN和BL Lac/FSRQ候选者的识别任务，并具有很高的准确性。此外，该方法还具有发现相对较弱变化和相对较暗的源的优势。 <div>
In the forthcoming era of big astronomical data, it is a burden to find target sources from ground-based and space-based telescopes. Although machine-learning methods have been extensively utilized to address this issue, the incorporation of in-depth data analysis can significantly enhance the efficiency of identifying target sources when dealing with massive volumes of astronomical data. In this work, we focused on the task of finding active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates and identifying BL Lacertae objects (BL Lac) or flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) candidates from the 4FGL_DR3 uncertain sources. We studied the correlations among the attributes of the 4FGL_DR3 catalog and proposed a novel method, named fractal dimension–inverse discrete wavelet transform (FDIDWT), to transform the original data. The transformed data set is characterized as low-dimensional and feature-highlighted, with the estimation of correlation features by fractal dimension theory and the multi-resolution analysis by inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT). Combining the FDIDWT method with an improved lightweight MatchboxConv1D model, we accomplished two missions: (1) to distinguish the AGNs from others (non-AGNs) in the 4FGL_DR3 uncertain sources with an accuracy of 96.65% ± 1.32%, namely Mission A; and (2) to classify blazar candidates of uncertain type into BL Lacs or FSRQs with an accuracy of 92.03% ± 2.2%, namely Mission B. There are 1354 AGN candidates in Mission A, and 482 BL Lacs candidates and 128 FSRQ candidates were found in Mission B. The results show a high consistency of greater than 98% with the results in previous works. In addition, our method has the advantage of finding less variable and relatively faint sources than ordinary methods.

Globular clusters (GCs)是特别高效形成毫秒脉冲星的地方。在这些脉冲星中，大约一半缺乏伴星，这个比例比银河系场中的要高得多。在一些最密集的GCs中，特别是那些经历了核心崩溃的GCs中，这个比例进一步增加，这表明动态相互作用过程起着关键作用。我们首次创建了能够重现类似银河系GCs中单脉冲星与双脉冲星的比例的N体模型。我们特别关注NGC 6752，这是一个典型的核心崩溃星团，观测到许多毫秒脉冲星。先前的研究表明，在最密集的星团中，中子星双星破碎率增加可能解释了这些系统中单个脉冲星的过多。在这里，我们证明双星破碎是无效的，相反，我们提出两个额外的动态过程起主导作用：（1）中子星对主序星团的潮汐破碎和（2）重型白矮星双星合并残余物的引力坍缩。通过这些过程形成的中子星也可能与最近在外星系GC中观测到的快速射电暴发有关。<br /><br />总结:GCs是形成毫秒脉冲星的高效地方，但一半以上缺乏伴星。N体模型能重现银河系GCs中的现象。NGC 6752是一个典型的核心崩溃星团，关于双脉冲星的过多有新的解释。双星破碎无效，而潮汐破碎和白矮星合并引起的中子星形成可能引起快速射电暴发。 <div>
Globular clusters (GCs) are particularly efficient at forming millisecond pulsars. Among these pulsars, about half lack a companion star, a significantly higher fraction than in the Galactic field. This fraction increases further in some of the densest GCs, especially those that have undergone core collapse, suggesting that dynamical interaction processes play a key role. For the first time, we create N-body models that reproduce the ratio of single-to-binary pulsars in Milky Way–like GCs. We focus especially on NGC 6752, a typical core-collapsed cluster with many observed millisecond pulsars. Previous studies suggested that an increased rate of neutron star binary disruption in the densest clusters could explain the overabundance of single pulsars in these systems. Here, we demonstrate that binary disruption is ineffective and instead we propose that two additional dynamical processes play dominant roles: (1) tidal disruption of main-sequence stars by neutron stars and (2) gravitational collapse of heavy white dwarf binary merger remnants. Neutron stars formed through these processes may also be associated with fast radio bursts similar to those observed recently in an extragalactic GC.

Galactic gamma-ray diffuse emission (GDE) is emitted by cosmic rays (CRs), ultra-relativistic protons, and electrons, interacting with gas and electromagnetic radiation fields in the interstellar medium. Here we present the analysis of teraelectronvolt diffuse emission from a region of the Galactic plane over the range in longitude of l ∈ [43°, 73°], using data collected with the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) detector. Spectral, longitudinal, and latitudinal distributions of the teraelectronvolt diffuse emission are shown. The radiation spectrum is compatible with the spectrum of the emission arising from a CR population with an index similar to that of the observed CRs. When comparing with the DRAGONbase model, the HAWC GDE flux is higher by about a factor of 2. Unresolved sources such as pulsar wind nebulae and teraelectronvolt halos could explain the excess emission. Finally, deviations of the Galactic CR flux from the locally measured CR flux may additionally explain the difference between the predicted and measured diffuse fluxes.

Aligned interstellar grains produce polarized extinction (observed at wavelengths from the far-ultraviolet to the mid-infrared) and polarized thermal emission (observed at far-infrared and submm wavelengths). The grains must be quite nonspherical, but the actual shapes are unknown. The relative efficacy for aligned grains to produce polarization at optical versus infrared wavelengths depends on particle shape. The discrete dipole approximation is used to calculate polarization cross sections for 20 different convex shapes, for wavelengths from 0.1 to 100 μm, and grain sizes aeff from 0.05 to 0.3 μm. Spheroids, cylinders, square prisms, and triaxial ellipsoids are considered. Minimum aspect ratios required by the observed starlight polarization are determined. Some shapes can also be ruled out because they provide too little or too much polarization at far-infrared and submm wavelengths. The ratio of 10 μm polarization to integrated optical polarization is almost independent of grain shape, varying by only ±8% among the viable convex shapes; thus, at least for convex grains, uncertainties in grain shape cannot account for the discrepancy between predicted and observed 10 μm polarization toward Cyg OB2-12.

这项研究利用Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam在八个独立的领域观测了近似2.2的Lyα发射线光度函数，通过观测方法来测量宇宙方差。研究报告了Lyα光度函数的最佳拟合Schechter函数参数。通过对样本进行采样并剔除可能引起宇宙方差测量偏差的区域，计算了σg。研究还调查了σg与调查体积V之间的关系，并拟合了简单的幂律关系。最后，研究比较了实测结果与模拟预测，发现LAEs的宇宙方差可能大于普通星系的宇宙方差。
<br /><br />总结: <br />Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam观测了近似2.2的Lyα发射线光度函数；研究报告了Lyα光度函数的最佳拟合Schechter函数参数；通过对样本进行采样并剔除可能引起宇宙方差测量偏差的区域，计算了σg；研究调查了σg与调查体积V之间的关系，并拟合了简单的幂律关系；最后，实测结果与模拟预测比较，发现LAEs的宇宙方差可能大于普通星系的宇宙方差。 <div>
Cosmic variance introduces significant uncertainties into galaxy number density properties when surveying the high-redshift Universe with a small volume. Such uncertainties produce the field-to-field variance σg of galaxy numbers in observational astronomy, which significantly affects the luminosity function (LF) measurement of Lyα emitters (LAEs). For most previous Lyα LF studies, σg is often adopted from predictions by cosmological simulations, but barely confirmed by observations. Measuring cosmic variance requires a huge sample over a large volume, exceeding the capabilities of most astronomical instruments. In this study, we demonstrate an observational approach for measuring the cosmic variance contribution for z ≈ 2.2 Lyα LFs. The LAE candidates are observed using the narrow band and broad band of the Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam in eight independent fields, making the total survey area ≃11.62 deg2 and a comoving volume of ≃8.71 × 106 Mpc3. We report a best-fit Schechter function with parameters α = −1.75 (fixed), {L}_{\mathrm{Ly}\alpha }^{* }={5.95}_{-0.96}^{+1.22}\times {10}^{42} erg s−1, and {\phi }_{\mathrm{Ly}\alpha }^{* }={5.26}_{-1.27}^{+1.65} × 10−4 Mpc−3 for the overall Lyα LFs. After clipping out the regions that may bias the cosmic variance measurements, we calculate σg by sampling LAEs within multiple pointings on the field image. We investigate the relation between σg and survey volume V, and fit a simple power-law {\sigma }_{g}=k\times {\left(\tfrac{V}{{10}^{5}\,{\mathrm{Mpc}}^{3}}\right)}^{\beta }. We find best-fit values of -{1.399}_{-0.156}^{+0.160} for β and {1.249}_{-0.193}^{+0.213} for k. We compare our measurements with predictions from simulations and find that the cosmic variance of LAEs is likely larger than that of general star-forming galaxies.

总结:<br /><br />本研究使用升级版巨型米波射电望远镜（uGMRT）对六颗明亮的脉冲星进行观测，测量了其散射弧特性，包括频率和时间的演变。观测覆盖频率范围从300到750 MHz，能够对频率、曲率、带宽和时间尺度等参数进行更准确的测量和比较。研究发现散射弧的不对称性与曲率存在强相关性，并发现了可能支持某一散射屏幕在一周左右时间内主导信号传播的证据。此外，观测还发现一些脉冲星的散射弧存在明显的曲率不对称性，表明其视线上存在折射现象。对于一些脉冲星还发现了先前研究中出现的多重散射弧和平坦的小弧特征。升级后的GMRT射电望远镜在未来的脉冲星散射研究中展现了良好的潜力。 <div>
We use the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) to measure scintillation arc properties in six bright canonical pulsars with simultaneous dual-frequency coverage. These observations, at frequencies from 300 to 750 MHz, allowed for detailed analysis of arc evolution across frequency and epoch. We perform more robust determinations of frequency dependence for arc curvature, scintillation bandwidth, and scintillation timescale, and comparison between arc curvature and pseudo-curvature than allowed by single-frequency-band-per-epoch measurements, which we find to agree with theory and previous literature. We find a strong correlation between arc asymmetry and arc curvature, which we have replicated using simulations, and attribute to a bias in the Hough transform approach to scintillation arc analysis. Possible evidence for an approximately week-long timescale over which a given scattering screen dominates signal propagation was found by tracking visible scintillation arcs in each epoch in PSR J1136+1551. The inclusion of a 155-minute observation allowed us to resolve the scale of scintillation variations on short timescales, which we find to be directly tied to the amount of interstellar medium sampled over the observation. Some of our pulsars showed either consistent or emerging asymmetries in arc curvature, indicating instances of refraction across their lines of sight. Significant features in various pulsars, such as multiple scintillation arcs in PSR J1136+1551 and flat arclets in PSR J1509+5531, that have been found in previous works, were also detected. The simultaneous multiple-band observing capability of the upgraded GMRT shows excellent promise for future pulsar scintillation work.

总结:<br />
该研究调查了等离子体对慢震荡不稳定性的影响。通过二维磁流体力学模拟，研究结果显示，慢震荡不稳定性最不稳定的尺度约为等离子体扩散长度的5倍。这对于了解星形成过程中慢震荡的影响具有重要意义。 <div>
The Herschel Gould Belt Survey showed that stars form in dense filaments in nearby molecular clouds. Recent studies suggest that massive filaments are bound by the slow shocks caused by accretion flows onto the filaments. The slow shocks are known to be unstable to corrugation deformation of the shock front. Corrugation instability could convert the accretion flow's ram pressure into turbulent pressure that influences the width of the filament, which, according to theory, determines the self-gravitational fragmentation scale and core mass. In spite of its importance, the effect of slow-shock instability on star-forming filaments has not been investigated. In addition, the linear dispersion relation obtained from ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) analysis shows that the most unstable wavelength of shock corrugation is infinitesimally small. In the scale of dense filaments, the effect of ambipolar diffusion can suppress the instability at small scales. This study investigates the influence of ambipolar diffusion on the instability of the slow shock. We perform two-dimensional MHD simulations to examine the linear growth of the slow-shock instability, considering the effect of ambipolar diffusion. The results demonstrate that the most unstable scale of slow-shock instability is approximately 5 times the length scale of ambipolar diffusion ℓAD calculated using post-shock variables, where ℓAD corresponds to the scale where the magnetic Reynolds number for ambipolar diffusivity is unity.

<div> 关键词: 太阳辐射、MeerKAT射电望远镜、频谱图像、太阳观测、大角度尺度

总结:
太阳辐射提供了估算太阳冠层不同物理参数的独特诊断手段，但在射电波段成像太阳冠层的高动态范围结构十分具有挑战性。MeerKAT射电望远镜在880-1670 MHz频段提供了高保真频谱图像，在与模拟图像的比较中表现出极好的形态相似性。观测结果显示，在约900 MHz以下，MeerKAT可以恢复整个太阳盘的大角度尺度的辐射通量。然而，在更高的频率下，缺失的通量可高达50%，但可以进行估算和修正。MeerKAT的太阳观测有望带来许多新的研究，开启大量未被探索的领域，并为未来的Square Kilometre Array-Mid望远镜的太阳科学研究铺平道路。 <div>
Solar radio emissions provide several unique diagnostics to estimate different physical parameters of the solar corona, which are otherwise simply inaccessible. However, imaging the highly dynamic solar coronal emissions spanning a large range of angular scales at radio wavelengths is extremely challenging. At gigahertz frequencies, MeerKAT radio telescope is possibly globally the best-suited instrument at present for providing high-fidelity spectroscopic snapshot solar images. Here, we present the first published spectroscopic images of the Sun made using the observations with MeerKAT in the 880–1670 MHz band. This work demonstrates the high fidelity of spectroscopic snapshot MeerKAT solar images through a comparison with simulated radio images at MeerKAT frequencies. The observed images show extremely good morphological similarities with the simulated images. Our analysis shows that below ∼900 MHz MeerKAT images can recover essentially the entire flux density from the large angular-scale solar disk. Not surprisingly, at higher frequencies, the missing flux density can be as large as ∼50%. However, it can potentially be estimated and corrected for. We believe once solar observation with MeerKAT is commissioned, it will enable a host of novel studies, open the door to a large unexplored phase space with significant discovery potential, and also pave the way for solar science with the upcoming Square Kilometre Array-Mid telescope, of which MeerKAT is a precursor.

<div> 边缘-on原行星盘，James Webb Space Telescope（JWST），IRAS40302+2247，反射星云，内倾区域

总结：<br /><br /> 这篇文章介绍了对IRAS40302+2247嵌入式年轻恒星周围边缘-on原行星盘的James Webb Space Telescope（JWST）成像结果。研究发现，源结构显示两个由暗区隔开的反射星云。源范围由∼4.4微米和较短波长处的扩展丝状包层主导，在7.7微米和更长波长时过渡到来自盘本身的更紧凑的散射光束。暗区厚度随波长变化不显著，这表明盘的上层存在中等大小（∼10微米）的颗粒。研究发现，IRAS40302最亮的星云在12.8和21微米之间切换。文章还探讨了内部倾斜区域对边缘-on盘的一般外观的影响，并发现包括内倾斜区域的盘的辐射传递模型可以再现最亮星云的倒转。此外，模型预测了特定方向的强烈侧向不对称性。观察到的许多边缘-on原行星盘显示出这种侧向不对称性，这表明大部分原行星盘可能存在内倾区域。星际斑点也可能引起侧向不对称性，但这种不对称性的预期变化周期明显较短。变化性研究可以帮助我们测试这些不对称性起源的主要情景。 <div>
We present James Webb Space Telescope imaging from 2 to 21 μm of the edge-on protoplanetary disk around the embedded young star IRAS04302+2247. The structure of the source shows two reflection nebulae separated by a dark lane. The source extent is dominated by the extended filamentary envelope at ∼4.4 μm and shorter wavelengths, transitioning at 7.7 μm and longer wavelengths to more compact lobes of scattered light from the disk itself. The dark lane thickness does not vary significantly with wavelength, which we interpret as an indication for intermediate-sized (∼10 μm) grains in the upper layers of the disk. Intriguingly, we find that the brightest nebula of IRAS40302 switches side between 12.8 and 21 μm. We explore the effect of a tilted inner region on the general appearance of edge-on disks. We find that radiative transfer models of a disk including a tilted inner region can reproduce an inversion in the brightest nebula. In addition, for specific orientations, the model predicts strong lateral asymmetries, which can occur for more than half possible viewing azimuths. A large number of edge-on protoplanetary disks observed in scattered light show such lateral asymmetries (15/20), which suggests that a large fraction of protoplanetary disks might host a tilted inner region. Stellar spots may also induce lateral asymmetries, which are expected to vary over a significantly shorter timescale. Variability studies of edge-on disks would allow us to test the dominant scenario for the origin of these asymmetries.

<div> 高速云，Hubble Space Telescope，金属含量，银河系，麦哲伦星系<br />
总结:<br />
这篇文章研究了小型高速云的金属含量，发现这些云的氧金属含量均≤0.17 Z⊙，因此不可能源自银河系的盘。其中有两个云的金属含量与麦哲伦星流相似，表明它们是麦哲伦星系的碎片。另外三个云的金属含量较低，可能是气态小暗物质晕或受到拉伸相互作用的矮星系的气体剥离。这些结果表明，小型高速云不一定都存在于银河系内部晕或麦哲伦星系，而可能追踪更远的结构。 <div>
High-velocity clouds (HVCs) are multiphase gas structures whose velocities (∣vLSR∣ ≥ 100 km s−1) are too high to be explained by Galactic disk rotation. While large HVCs are well characterized, compact and small HVCs (with H i angular sizes of a few degrees) are poorly understood. Possible origins for such small clouds include Milky Way (MW) halo gas or fragments of the Magellanic System, but neither their origin nor their connection to the MW halo has been confirmed. We use new Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph UV spectra and Green Bank Telescope H i spectra to measure the metallicities of five small HVCs in the southern Galactic sky projected near the Magellanic System. We build a set of distance-dependent Cloudy photoionization models for each cloud and calculate their ionization-corrected metallicities. All five small HVCs have oxygen metallicities ≤0.17 Z⊙, indicating they do not originate in the disk of the MW. Two of the five have metallicities of 0.16–0.17 Z⊙, similar to the Magellanic Stream, suggesting these clouds are fragments of the Magellanic System. The remaining three clouds have much lower metallicities of 0.02–0.04 Z⊙. While the origin of these low-metallicity clouds is unclear, they could be gaseous minihalos or gas stripped from dwarf galaxies by ram pressure or tidal interactions. These results suggest that small HVCs do not all reside in the inner MW halo or the Magellanic System, but instead can trace more distant structures.

总结:
通过UNIONS调查发现了银河系中亮度最低的卫星Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1，其被估计具有+2.2 mag的绝对V带星等，相当于总星体质量约16M⊙。经过Keck II/DEIMOS随访光谱学确认了其存在，并识别出了11个径向速度成员，其中8个有Gaia的完整天文测量数据，并根据它们的 proper motions 确定了它们的共同运动。根据这11个径向速度成员，我们得出了一个固有速度离散度约为3.7 km s−1，但一些注意事项目前阻碍了这个值被解释为潜在重力势。 Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 的存在可能被二元星体膨胀了这个测量值，因此认为它是一个进行多次观测的高优先级候选目标，以了解这个非常微弱卫星的真实性质。 <div>
We present the discovery of Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1, the least luminous known satellite of the Milky Way, which is estimated to have an absolute V-band magnitude of +{2.2}_{-0.3}^{+0.4} mag, equivalent to a total stellar mass of {16}_{-5}^{+6}M⊙. Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 was uncovered in the deep, wide-field Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS) and is consistent with an old (τ &gt; 11 Gyr), metal-poor ([Fe/H] ∼ −2.2) stellar population at a heliocentric distance of ∼10 kpc. Despite its being compact (rh = 3 ± 1 pc) and composed of few stars, we confirm the reality of Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 with Keck II/DEIMOS follow-up spectroscopy and identify 11 radial velocity members, eight of which have full astrometric data from Gaia and are co-moving based on their proper motions. Based on these 11 radial velocity members, we derive an intrinsic velocity dispersion of {3.7}_{-1.0}^{+1.4} km s−1 but some caveats preclude this value from being interpreted as a direct indicator of the underlying gravitational potential at this time. Primarily, the exclusion of the largest velocity outlier from the member list drops the velocity dispersion to {1.9}_{-1.1}^{+1.4} km s−1, and the subsequent removal of an additional outlier star produces an unresolved velocity dispersion. While the presence of binary stars may be inflating the measurement, the possibility of a significant velocity dispersion makes Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 a high-priority candidate for multi-epoch spectroscopic follow-ups to deduce the true nature of this incredibly faint satellite.

We present a comprehensive study of type III radio bursts and their association with solar flares of magnitude M1.0 and larger, as observed by four widely separated spacecraft (Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, STEREO-A, and Wind). Our main focus is the introduction and validation of two methods for localizing radio bursts using the available multispacecraft data. The first method utilizes intensity fitting with a circular Gaussian distribution, while the second method is based on the time arrival of radio bursts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods through the analysis of a single type III burst event and compare their results with the traditional radio triangulation technique. Furthermore, we conduct a statistical study of 17 type III bursts associated with M- and X-class solar flares in years 2020–2022. Our findings suggest a possible correlation between solar flare intensities and longitudes, with east limb flares tending to be weaker than west limb flares. We also observe a systematic drift of radio burst longitudes toward the east, potentially explained by a poleward component of the local density gradient. Our results suggest a strong correlation between solar flare intensities and radio burst properties, enhancing our understanding of the relationship between solar flares and type III radio bursts.

<br />总结:
GRAPES-3 是一个位于中纬度（2200米）和赤道附近（纬度11.°4N）的空气阵列，与北半球和南半球的实验重叠，用于观测宇宙射线。该研究分析了2013年1月1日至2016年12月31日期间GRAPES-3实验收集的37亿个宇宙射线事件样本，其中能量中值约为16TeV，用于研究小尺度（<60°）角尺度各向异性。研究发现了两个结构A和B，它们与预期的宇宙射线各向同性分布存在显著偏差。这些结果与Milagro、ARGO-YBJ和HAWC的观测结果一致。这些观测结果有望更好地理解宇宙射线的来源、传播以及银河系中的磁结构。 <div>
GRAPES-3 is a mid-altitude (2200 m) and near-equatorial (11.°4N) air shower array, overlapping in its field of view for cosmic-ray observations with experiments that are located in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. We analyze a sample of 3.7 × 109 cosmic-ray events collected by the GRAPES-3 experiment between 2013 January 1 and 2016 December 31 with a median energy of ∼16 TeV for study of small-scale (&lt;60°) angular-scale anisotropies. We observed two structures, labeled A and B, that deviate from the expected isotropic distribution of cosmic rays in a statistically significant manner. Structure A spans 50°–80° in R.A. and from −15° to 30° in decl. The relative excess observed in structure A is at the level of (6.5 ± 1.3) × 10−4 with a statistical significance of 6.8 standard deviations. Structure B is observed in the R.A. range 110°–140° and at decl. from −10° to 30°. The relative excess observed in this region is at the level of (4.9 ± 1.4) × 10−4 with a statistical significance of 4.7 standard deviations. These structures are consistent with those reported by Milagro, ARGO-YBJ, and HAWC. These observations could provide a better understanding of the sources of cosmic rays, their propagation, and the magnetic structures in our Galaxy.

<br />
通过NICER观测，第一次推断出PSR J0030+0451的质量和半径，并对描述密集物质的状态方程进行了限制。使用升级后的分析框架重新分析了NICER数据，并结合XMM-Newton数据进行了联合分析，发现了后验面的多模结构。包括XMM-Newton数据的约束排除了先前发现的主要解决方案，而是支持了新的和更复杂的模型。这些模型显示出推断出的质量和半径取决于所假定的模型，并指向了温度梯度的存在和需要考虑这一点。得出的推断质量和半径分别为∼[1.4 M⊙, 11.5 km]和∼[1.7 M⊙, 14.5 km]。这些发现是对先前研究的拓展，并且对于理解PSR J0030+0451的物理性质非常重要。
<br /><br />总结: PSR J0030+0451的质量和半径在1.4-1.7M⊙和11.5-14.5km之间，新的分析方法揭示了质量和半径的多模结构，需要考虑温度梯度的存在。 <div>
In 2019 the NICER collaboration published the first mass and radius inferred for PSR J0030+0451, thanks to NICER observations, and consequent constraints on the equation of state characterizing dense matter. Two independent analyses found a mass of ∼1.3–1.4 M⊙ and a radius of ∼13  km. They also both found that the hot spots were all located on the same hemisphere, opposite to the observer, and that at least one of them had a significantly elongated shape. Here we reanalyze, in greater detail, the same NICER data set, incorporating the effects of an updated NICER response matrix and using an upgraded analysis framework. We expand the adopted models and also jointly analyze XMM-Newton data, which enables us to better constrain the fraction of observed counts coming from PSR J0030+0451. Adopting the same models used in previous publications, we find consistent results, although with more stringent inference requirements. We also find a multimodal structure in the posterior surface. This becomes crucial when XMM-Newton data is accounted for. Including the corresponding constraints disfavors the main solutions found previously, in favor of the new and more complex models. These have inferred masses and radii of ∼[1.4 M⊙, 11.5 km] and ∼[1.7 M⊙, 14.5 km], depending on the assumed model. They display configurations that do not require the two hot spots generating the observed X-rays to be on the same hemisphere, nor to show very elongated features, and point instead to the presence of temperature gradients and the need to account for them.

在这篇文章中，研究了行星对原行星盘中密度波的影响，以及行星如何打开环形气体间隙。研究发现，间隙的深度受到了密度波带来的角动量演化的影响。文章使用Athena++模拟了盘行星相互作用的过程，并将冷却过程视为热力学松弛过程。研究建立了间隙深度和宽度与行星质量、Shakura-Sunyaev粘度、盘高度和热松弛时间尺度的定量关系。研究还发现，当热松弛时间尺度与局部动力学时间尺度相同时，间隙打开最弱。不同的热松弛时间尺度会导致间隙深度显著变化。研究还推导了AS 209、HD 163296、MWC 480和HL Tau中间隙打开行星的可能质量，考虑到局部热松弛时间尺度的不确定性。

Planets can excite density waves and open annular gas gaps in protoplanetary disks. The depth of gaps is influenced by the evolving angular momentum carried by density waves. While the impact of radiative cooling on the evolution of density waves has been studied, a quantitative correlation to connect gap depth with the cooling timescale is lacking. To address this knowledge gap, we employ the grid-based code Athena++ to simulate disk-planet interactions, treating cooling as a thermal relaxation process. We establish quantitative dependencies of steady-state gap depth (Equation 36) and width (Equation 41) on planetary mass, Shakura–Sunyaev viscosity, disk scale height, and thermal relaxation timescale (β). We confirm previous results that gap opening is the weakest when the thermal relaxation timescale is comparable to the local dynamical timescale. Significant variations in gap depth, up to an order of magnitude, are found with different β. In terms of width, a gap is at its narrowest around β = 1, approximately 10%–20% narrower compared to the isothermal case. When β ∼ 100, it can be ∼20% wider, and higher viscosity enhances this effect. We derive possible masses of the gas gap-opening planets in AS 209, HD 163296, MWC 480, and HL Tau, accounting for the uncertainties in the local thermal relaxation timescale.

总结: <br />
这篇文章讨论了如何从外行星的宿主恒星中提取信息以研究外行星的星球水平趋势。通过提取加州Kepler调查Gaia调查光谱中的铬层活动测量值，研究人员得出了恒星活动和基本恒星性质之间的联系。他们发现了一些恒星自转周期的差异，并支持了恒星磁制动减弱的理论。此外，他们还发现了铬层活动与金属丰度之间的关系，并且能够识别可能处于莫德林极小状态的恒星。这些结果对未来的理论研究提供了重要信息，可以探讨恒星活动、恒星自转和磁力发电机之间的关系。<br /> <div>
Surveys of exoplanet host stars are valuable tools for assessing population level trends in exoplanets, and their outputs can include stellar ages, activity, and rotation periods. We extracted chromospheric activity measurements from the California-Kepler Survey Gaia survey spectra in order to probe connections between stellar activity and fundamental stellar properties. Building on the California Kepler Survey's legacy of 1189 planet host star stellar properties including temperature, surface gravity metallicity, and isochronal age, we add measurements of the Ca ii H and K lines as a proxy for chromospheric activity for 879 planet hosting stars. We used these chromospheric activity measurements to derive stellar rotation periods. We find a discrepancy between photometrically derived and activity-derived rotation periods for stars on the Rossby Ridge. These results support the theory of weakened magnetic braking. We find no evidence for metallicity-dependent activity relations, within the metallicity range of −0.2 to +0.3 dex. With our single epoch spectra we identify stars that are potentially in Maunder minimum–like state using a combination of log({R}_{\mathrm{HK}}^{{\prime} }) and position below the main sequence. We do not yet have the multiyear time series needed to verify stars in Maunder minimum–like states. These results can help inform future theoretical studies that explore the relationship between stellar activity, stellar rotation, and magnetic dynamos.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has been continuously taking data to search for { \mathcal O }(0.5\mbox{--}10) s long neutrino bursts since 2007. Even if a Galactic core-collapse supernova is optically obscured or collapses to a black hole instead of exploding, it will be detectable via the { \mathcal O }(10) MeV neutrino burst emitted during the collapse. We discuss a search for such events covering the time between 2008 April 17 and 2019 December 31. Considering the average data taking and analysis uptime of 91.7% after all selection cuts, this is equivalent to 10.735 yr of continuous data taking. In order to test the most conservative neutrino production scenario, the selection cuts were optimized for a model based on an 8.8 solar mass progenitor collapsing to an O–Ne–Mg core. Conservative assumptions on the effects of neutrino oscillations in the exploding star were made. The final selection cut was set to ensure that the probability to detect such a supernova within the Milky Way exceeds 99%. No such neutrino burst was found in the data after performing a blind analysis. Hence, a 90% C.L. upper limit on the rate of core-collapse supernovae out to distances of ≈25 kpc was determined to be 0.23 yr−1. For the more distant Magellanic Clouds, only high neutrino luminosity supernovae will be detectable by IceCube, unless external information on the burst time is available. We determined a model-independent limit by parameterizing the dependence on the neutrino luminosity and the energy spectrum.

总结:
本文使用Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam对约3300个Lyα辐射体(LAEs)进行堆叠观测，鉴定了一个z=2.2-2.3的Lyα晕(LAH)。通过分光观测和数据处理，确定样本的污染率较低(8%)。利用中值堆叠方法，发现LAH在2σ显著水平下延伸至约100kpc，在表面亮度水平约为10-20 erg s-1 cm-2 arcsec-2时可能延伸至约200kpc。比较不同的红移、领域和选择方法，发现本文的LAH在约25-100kpc半径范围内更亮。进一步分析表明，更高的Lyα发射光度、较小的等效宽度和更亮的UV星等会导致更广泛的LAH。结果表明，质量更大的LAEs通常拥有更广泛的LAHs。 <div>
In this paper, we present a Lyα halo (LAH) identified by stacking ∼3300 Lyα emitters (LAEs) at z = 2.2–2.3. We carry out imaging observations and data reduction with Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam. Our total survey area is ∼12 deg2 and the imaging depths are 25.5–27.0 mag. Using the imaging data, we select 1240 and 2101 LAE candidates at z = 2.2 and 2.3, respectively. We carry out spectroscopic observations of our LAE candidates and data reduction with Magellan/IMACS to estimate the contamination rate of our LAE candidates. We find that the contamination rate of our sample is low (8%). We stack our LAE candidates with a median stacking method to identify the LAH at z = 2. We show that our LAH is detected until ∼100 kpc at the 2σ significance level and likely extended to ∼200 kpc at a surface brightness level of ∼10−20 erg s−1 cm−2 arcsec−2. Compared to those of previous studies, our LAH is brighter at radii of ∼25–100 kpc, which is not likely caused by the contamination in our sample but by the different redshifts, fields, and selection methods instead. To investigate how central galaxies affect surrounding LAHs, we divide our LAEs into subsamples based on the Lyα luminosity (LLyα), rest-frame Lyα equivalent width (EW0), and UV magnitude (Muv). We stack the subsamples and find that higher LLyα, smaller EW0, and brighter Muv cause more extended halos. Our results suggest that more massive LAEs generally have more extended LAHs.

HDF850.1 is the brightest submillimeter galaxy (SMG) in the Hubble Deep Field. It is known as a heavily dust-obscured star-forming galaxy embedded in an overdense environment at z = 5.18. With nine-band NIRCam images at 0.8–5.0 μm obtained through the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey, we detect and resolve the rest-frame UV–optical counterpart of HDF850.1, which splits into two components because of heavy dust obscuration in the center. The southern component leaks UV and Hα photons, bringing the galaxy ∼100  times above the empirical relation between infrared excess and UV continuum slope (IRX–βUV). The northern component is higher in dust attenuation and thus fainter in UV and Hα surface brightness. We construct a spatially resolved dust-attenuation map from the NIRCam images, well matched with the dust continuum emission obtained through millimeter interferometry. The whole system hosts a stellar mass of 1010.8±0.1M⊙ and star formation rate (SFR) of 102.8±0.2M⊙ yr−1, placing the galaxy at the massive end of the star-forming main sequence at this epoch. We further confirm that HDF850.1 resides in a complex overdense environment at z = 5.17–5.30, which hosts another luminous SMG at z = 5.30 (GN10). The filamentary structures of the overdensity are characterized by 109 Hα-emitting galaxies confirmed through NIRCam slitless spectroscopy at 3.9–5 μm, of which only eight were known before the JWST observations. Given the existence of a similar galaxy overdensity in the GOODS-S field, our results suggest that 50% ± 20% of the cosmic star formation at z = 5.1–5.5 occur in protocluster environments.

The discovery and timing follow up of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are necessary not just for their usefulness in pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) but also for investigating their own intriguing properties. In this work, we provide the findings of the decade-long timing of four MSPs discovered by the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT), including their timing precision, model parameters, and newly detected proper motions. We compare the timing results for these MSPs before and after the GMRT upgrade in 2017 and characterize the improvement in timing precision due to the bandwidth upgrade. We discuss the suitability of these four GMRT MSPs as well as the usefulness of the decade-long timing data for PTA experiments. These data may aid in the global effort to improve the signal-to-noise ratios of recently detected signature of gravitational waves in cross-correlation statistics of residuals of MSPs.

<div> 星系、恒星质量、光谱能量分布、星形成史、宇宙早期<br />
总结:<br />
本研究表明，在大爆炸后的头十亿年内形成的星系的恒星质量推断存在根本的不确定性，这是由于星系综合光谱中来自早期星形成的信息丢失。尽管早期星形成对高红移系统的总恒星质量贡献很大，但在探测时期的持续星形成会盖过早期爆发的残留光，导致恒星质量的准确测定受到影响。因此，在恒星质量上可以预期存在数量级的不确定性。通过在宇宙背景下进行宇宙学模拟，我们证明了这一潜在问题。具体来说，我们进行了两种具有显著不同恒星反馈模型的宇宙学模拟，这些模型涵盖了星形成史爆发程度的显著范围。我们通过三维尘埃辐射传输计算模拟了这些模型星系在z=7时的模拟光谱，然后使用prospector光谱拟合软件对这些光谱进行了反向拟合。我们发现了z>7星系推导的恒星质量的不确定性，这促使我们发展新的技术和/或先验知识来模拟早期宇宙中的星形成史。 <div>
We demonstrate that the inference of galaxy stellar masses via spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting techniques for galaxies formed in the first billion years after the Big Bang carries fundamental uncertainties owing to the loss of star formation history (SFH) information from the very first episodes of star formation in the integrated spectra of galaxies. While this early star formation can contribute substantially to the total stellar mass of high-redshift systems, ongoing star formation at the time of detection outshines the residual light from earlier bursts, hampering the determination of accurate stellar masses. As a result, order-of-magnitude uncertainties in stellar masses can be expected. We demonstrate this potential problem via direct numerical simulation of galaxy formation in a cosmological context. In detail, we carry out two cosmological simulations with significantly different stellar feedback models, which span a significant range in SFH burstiness. We compute the mock SEDs for these model galaxies at z = 7 via calculations of 3D dust radiative transfer, and then backward fit these SEDs with prospector SED fitting software. The uncertainties in derived stellar masses that we find for z &gt; 7 galaxies motivate the development of new techniques and/or priors for SFH to model star formation in the early Universe.

总结:<br />
研究发现了星系一致性现象，即具有特定物理特性的星系与相邻星系具有相关性，暗示可能存在因果关系。采用原始亚哈洛匹配方法，提出了简明的一致性模型，改善了ELG和暗物质晕的连接关系。模型表明，在中心星系是ELG的暗物质晕中，卫星ELG的数量将提高约5倍。通过该模型，可以准确描述ELG在整个红移范围内的聚类现象。预期该方法可用于生成适用于DESI的高质量ELG光锥模拟。 <div>
Galactic conformity is the phenomenon whereby a galaxy of a certain physical property is correlated with its neighbors of the same property, implying a possible causal relationship. The observed auto correlations of emission-line galaxies (ELGs) from the highly complete DESI One-Percent Survey exhibit a strong clustering signal on small scales, providing clear evidence for the conformity effect of ELGs. Building upon the original subhalo abundance-matching (SHAM) method developed by Gao et al., we propose a concise conformity model to improve the ELG–halo connection. In this model, the number of satellite ELGs is boosted by a factor of ∼5 in the halos whose central galaxies are ELGs. We show that the mean ELG satellite number in such central halos is still smaller than 1 and that the model does not significantly increase the overall satellite fraction. With this model, we can well recover the ELG auto correlations to the smallest scales explored with the current data (i.e., rp &gt; 0.03 Mpc h−1 in real space and at s &gt; 0.3 Mpc h−1 in redshift space), while the cross correlations between luminous red galaxies and ELGs are nearly unchanged. Although our SHAM model has only eight parameters, we further verify that it can accurately describe the ELG clustering in the entire redshift range from z = 0.8 to 1.6. We therefore expect that this method can be used to generate high-quality ELG lightcone mocks for DESI.

In the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) perspective, the planet’s bow shock would disappear when the fast-mode Mach number (MF) of the solar wind is less than one. Compared to Earth, Mercury is subject to a lower MF solar wind due to its proximity to the Sun, resulting in a higher possibility of the disappearance of its bow shock. To examine the variability of Mercury’s bow shock in response to the solar wind properties, analyses of the observations by the Helios spacecraft at 0.30–0.50 au during 1975–1983, covering solar cycle 21, together with the theoretical solutions and MHD simulations are conducted in this study. Our observational analyses show that more solar wind data with extremely low fast-mode Mach numbers (say, MF ≤ 1.5) are observed during the rising and maximum phases and are characterized by a significantly low proton number density. It is also found that approximately 35% of the extremely low fast-mode Mach number solar wind events (MF ≤ 1.5) occur within the main body of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs), while about 58% of them are unrelated to ICMEs. Three of these events are selected to demonstrate that the occurrences of the solar wind with MF ≤ 1.5 may not be necessarily affected by ICMEs. Our theoretical and numerical results indicate that when Mercury encounters the solar wind with MF ≤ 1.5, its bow shock would move farther away, become flattened, and even disappear. Furthermore, our calculations suggest that Mercury’s bow shock would become a slow-mode shock with a concave-upward structure under such extreme solar wind conditions.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Inhomogeneous cloud formation and wavelength-dependent phenomena are expected to shape hot Jupiter atmospheres. We present a general circulation model with multiwavelength “picket fence” radiative transfer and radiatively active, temperature-dependent clouds, and compare the results to those of a double gray routine. The double gray method inherently fails to model polychromatic effects in hot Jupiter atmospheres, while picket fence captures these non-gray aspects and performs well compared to fully wavelength-dependent methods. We compare both methods with radiatively active clouds and cloud-free models, assessing the limitations of the double gray method. Although there are broad similarities, the picket fence models have larger dayside–nightside temperature differences, nonisothermal upper atmospheres, and multiwavelength effects in the presence of radiatively active clouds. We model the well-known hot Jupiters HD 189733 b and HD 209458 b. For the hotter HD 209458 b, the picket fence method prevents clouds from thermostating dayside temperatures, resulting in hotter upper atmospheres and the dissipation of dayside clouds. Differences in the temperature structures are then associated with nuanced differences in the circulation patterns and clouds. Models of the cooler HD 189733 b have global cloud coverage, regardless of the radiative transfer scheme, whereas there are larger differences in the models of HD 209458 b, particularly in the extent of the partial cloud coverage on its dayside. This results in minor changes to the thermal and reflected light phase curves of HD 189733 b, but more significant differences for the picket fence and double gray versions of HD 209458 b.

<title>Unobscured Central Broad-line Regions in Type-1.9 AGN SDSS J1241+2602</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Strong evidence is reported to support unobscured broad-line regions (BLRs) in Type-1.9 active galactic nucleus (AGN) SDSS J1241+2602 with reliable broad Hα but no broad Hβ. Commonly, the disappearance of broad Hβ can be explained by the AGN unified model, in which heavily obscured BLRs are expected in Type-1.9 AGNs. Here, based on properties of two kinds of BH masses, the virial BH mass and the BH mass obtained through the MBH–σ relation, an independent method is proposed to test whether there are unobscured central BLRs in a Type-1.9 AGN. By the reliable measurement of stellar velocity dispersion of about 110 ± 12 km s −1 through the host galaxy absorption features in SDSS J1241+2602, the BH mass obtained through the MBH–σ relation is consistent with the virial BH mass (3.43 ± 1.25) × 107 M⊙ determined through properties of the observed broad Hα without considering the effects of obscurations in SDSS J1241+2602. Meanwhile, if considering heavily obscured BLRs in SDSS J1241+2602, the reddening-corrected virial BH mass is tens of times larger than the value expected from MBH–σ, leading SDSS J1241+2602 to be an outlier in the MBH–σ space with a confidence level higher than 5σ. Therefore, unobscured BLRs are preferred in the Type-1.9 AGN SDSS J1241+2602. The results indicate that it is necessary to check whether unobscured central BLRs are common in Type-1.9 AGNs when testing the unified model of AGNs through properties of Type-1.9 AGNs.

<title>A Machine Learning Approach to Understanding the Physical Properties of Magnetic Flux Ropes in the Solar Wind at 1 au</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Interplanetary magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) are commonly observed structures in the solar wind, categorized as magnetic clouds (MCs) and small-scale MFRs (SMFRs) depending on whether they are associated with coronal mass ejections. We apply machine learning to systematically compare SMFRs, MCs, and ambient solar wind plasma properties. We construct a data set of 3-minute averaged sequential data points of the solar wind’s instantaneous bulk fluid plasma properties using about 20 years of measurements from Wind. We label samples by the presence and type of MFRs containing them using a catalog based on Grad–Shafranov (GS) automated detection for SMFRs and NASA's catalog for MCs (with samples in neither labeled non-MFRs). We apply the random forest machine learning algorithm to find which categories can be more easily distinguished and by what features. MCs were distinguished from non-MFRs with an area under the receiver-operator curve (AUC) of 94% and SMFRs with an AUC of 89%, and had distinctive plasma properties. In contrast, while SMFRs were distinguished from non-MFRs with an AUC of 86%, this appears to rely solely on the 〈B〉 &gt; 5 nT threshold applied by the GS catalog. The results indicate that SMFRs have virtually the same plasma properties as the ambient solar wind, unlike the distinct plasma regimes of MCs. We interpret our findings as additional evidence that most SMFRs at 1 au are generated within the solar wind. We also suggest that they should be considered a salient feature of the solar wind’s magnetic structure rather than transient events.

<title>The Diffusion and Scattering of Accelerating Particles in Compressible MHD Turbulence</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We numerically study the diffusion and scattering of cosmic rays (CRs) together with their acceleration processes in the framework of the modern understanding of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. Based on the properties of compressible MHD turbulence obtained from observations and numerical experiments, we investigate the interaction of CRs with plasma modes. We find that (1) the gyroradius of particles exponentially increases with the acceleration timescale; (2) the momentum diffusion presents the power-law relationship with the gyroradius in the strong turbulence regime, and shows a plateau in the weak turbulence regime implying a stochastic acceleration process; (3) the spatial diffusion is dominated by the parallel diffusion in the sub-Alfvénic regime, while it is dominated by the perpendicular diffusion in the super-Alfvénic one; (4) as for the interaction of CRs with plasma modes, the particle acceleration is dominated by the fast mode in the high β case, while in the low β case, it is dominated by the fast and slow modes; and (5) in the presence of acceleration, magnetosonic modes still play a critical role in the diffusion and scattering processes of CRs, which is in good agreement with earlier theoretical predictions.

<title>Using Potential Field Extrapolations to Explore the Origin of Type II Spicules</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We used 29 high-resolution line-of-sight magnetograms acquired with the Goode Solar Telescope (GST) in a quiet-Sun area to extrapolate a series of potential field configurations and study their time variations. The study showed that there are regions that consistently exhibit changes in loop connectivity, whereas other vast areas do not show such changes. Analysis of the topological features of the potential fields indicates that the photospheric footprint of the separatrix between open- and closed-loop systems closely matches the roots of rapid blue- and redshifted excursions, which are disk counterparts of type II spicules. There is a tendency for the footpoints of the observed Hα features to be cospatial with the footpoints of the loops that most frequently change their connectivity, while the area occupied by the open fields that did not show any significant and persistent connectivity changes is void of prominent jet and spicular activity. We also detected and tracked magnetic elements using the Southwest Automatic Magnetic Identification Suite and GST magnetograms, which allowed us to construct artificial magnetograms and calculate the corresponding potential field configurations. Analysis of the artificial data showed tendencies similar to those found for the observed data. The present study suggests that a significant amount of chromospheric activity observed in the far wings of the Hα spectral line may be generated by reconnecting closed-loop systems and canopy fields consisting of “open” field lines.

<title>Simulating Hydrogen-poor Interaction-powered Supernovae with CHIPS</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the updated open-source code Complete History of Interaction-Powered Supernovae (CHIPS) that can be applied to modeling supernovae (SNe) arising from an interaction with the massive circumstellar medium (CSM) as well as the formation process of the CSM. Our update mainly concerns extensions to hydrogen-poor SNe from stripped progenitors, targeting the modeling of interaction-powered SNe Ibc, such as Type Ibn and Icn SNe. We successfully reproduce the basic properties of the light curves of these types of SNe that occur after the partial eruption of the outermost layer with a mass of 0.01–0.1 M⊙ at ≲1 year before explosion. We also find that the luminosity of the observed precursors can be naturally explained by the outburst that creates the dense CSM, given that the energy of the outburst is efficiently dissipated by collision with an external material, possibly generated by a previous mass eruption. We discuss possible scenarios causing eruptive mass loss based on our results.

<title>Apparent Effect of Dust Extinction on the Observed Outflow Velocity of Ionized Gas in Galaxy Mergers</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad0dfc</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad0dfc</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this study, we examine photoionization outflows during the late stages of galaxy mergers, with a specific focus on the relation between the observed velocity of outflowing gas and the apparent effects of dust extinction. We used the N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics code ASURA for galaxy merger simulations. These simulations concentrated on identical galaxy mergers featuring supermassive black holes of 108M⊙ and gas fractions of 30% and 10%. From the simulation data, we derived velocity and velocity dispersion diagrams for the active galactic nuclei (AGN)-driven ionized outflowing gas. Our findings show that high-velocity outflows with velocity dispersions of 500 km s−1 or greater can be observed in the late stages of galactic mergers. Particularly, in buried AGNs, both the luminosity-weighted outflow velocity and velocity dispersion increase owing to the apparent effects of dust extinction. Owing to these effects, velocity–velocity dispersion diagrams display a noticeable blue-shifted tilt in models with higher gas fractions. Crucially, this tilt is not influenced by the AGN luminosity but emerges from the observational impacts of dust extinction. Our results imply that the observed high-velocity [O iii] λ5007 outflow exceeding 1000 km s−1 in buried AGNs may be linked to the dust extinction that occurs during the late stages of gas-rich galaxy mergers.

<title>The Extended [C ii] under Construction? Observation of the Brightest High-z Lensed Star-forming Galaxy at z = 6.2</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present results of [C ii] 158 μm emission line observations, and report the spectroscopic redshift confirmation of a strongly lensed (μ ∼ 20) star-forming galaxy, MACS0308-zD1 at z = 6.2078 ± 0.0002. The [C ii] emission line is detected with a signal-to-noise ratio &gt;6 within the rest-frame UV-bright clump of the lensed galaxy (zD1.1) and exhibits multiple velocity components; the narrow [C ii] has a velocity full width half maximum (FWHM) of 110 ± 20 km s−1, while broader [C ii] is seen with an FWHM of 230 ± 50 km s−1. The broader [C ii] component is blueshifted (−80 ± 20 km s−1) with respect to the narrow [C ii] component, and has a morphology that extends beyond the UV-bright clump. We find that, while the narrow [C ii] emission is most likely associated with zD1.1, the broader component is possibly associated with a physically distinct gas component from zD1.1 (e.g., outflowing or inflowing gas). Based on the nondetection of λ158μm dust continuum, we find that MACS0308-zD1's star formation activity occurs in a dust-free environment indicated by a strong upper limit of infrared luminosity ≲9 × 108L⊙. Targeting this strongly lensed faint galaxy for follow-up Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and JWST observations will be crucial to characterize the details of typical galaxy growth in the early Universe.

<title>Probing Disk Ice Content and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Emission through Multiband MagAO+Clio Images of HD 141569</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present resolved images of the inner disk component around HD 141569A using the Magellan adaptive optics system with the Clio2 1–5 μm camera, offering a glimpse of a complex system thought to be in a short evolutionary phase between protoplanetary and debris disk stages. We use a reference star along with the Karhunen–Loéve image projection (KLIP) algorithm for point-spread function subtraction to detect the disk inward to about 0.″24 (∼25 au assuming a distance of 111 pc) at high signal-to-noise ratios at L^{\prime} (3.8 μm), Ls (3.3 μm), and narrowband Ice (3.1 μm). We identify an arc or spiral arm structure at the southeast extremity, consistent with previous studies. We implement forward modeling with a simple disk model within the framework of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler to better constrain the geometrical attributes and photometry using our KLIP-reduced disk images. We then leverage these modeling results to facilitate a comparison of the measured brightness in each passband to find a reduction in scattered light from the disk in the Ice filter, implying significant absorption due to water ice in the dust. Additionally, our best-fit disk models exhibit peak brightness in the southwestern, back-scattering region of the disk, which we suggest to be possible evidence of 3.3 μm polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission. However, we point out the need for additional observations with bluer filters and more complex modeling to confirm these hypotheses.

<title>Chemodynamical Nature of the Anticenter Stream and Monoceros Ring</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In the epoch of deep photometric surveys, a large number of substructures—e.g., overdensities and streams—have been identified. With the help of astrometry and spectroscopy, the community has revealed a complex picture of our Milky Way (MW) after investigating their origins. The off-plane substructures the Anticenter Stream (ACS) and Monoceros Ring (MNC), once considered as dissolving dwarf galaxies, were later found to share similar kinematics and metallicity with the Galactic outer thin disk. In this work, we aim to chemically tag ACS and MNC with high-accuracy abundances from the APOGEE survey. By extrapolating chemical abundance trends in the outer thin-disk region (10 &lt; RGC &lt; 18 kpc, 0 &lt; ∣ZGC∣ &lt; 3 kpc), we found that ACS and MNC stars show consistent chemical abundances as the extrapolating values for 12 elements, including C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Cr, Mn, Co, and Ni. The similar chemical patterns indicate that ACS and MNC have a similar star formation history as the MW outer thin disk, while we also excluded their dwarf galaxy association, as they are distinctive in multiple chemical spaces. The ages of ACS and MNC stars are consistent with the time of the first Sagittarius dSph passage, indicating their possible connection.

<title>Direct Formation of Massive Black Holes via Dynamical Collapse in Metal-enriched Merging Galaxies at z ∼ 10: Fully Cosmological Simulations</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad11cf</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the results of the first fully cosmological hydrodynamical simulations studying the merger-driven model for massive black hole (BH) seed formation via direct collapse. Using the zoom-in technique as well as particle splitting, we achieve a final spatial resolution of 2 pc. We show that the major merger of two massive galaxies at redshift z ∼ 8 results in the formation of a nuclear supermassive disk (SMD) of only 4 pc in radius, owing to a prodigious gas inflow sustained at 100–1000 M⊙ yr−1. The core of the merger remnant is metal-rich, well above solar abundance, and the SMD reaches a gaseous mass of 3 × 108M⊙ in less than a million years after the merger, despite a concurrent prominent nuclear starburst. Dynamical heating as gas falls into the deepest part of the potential well, and heating and stirring by supernova blastwaves, generate a turbulent multiphase interstellar medium, with a gas velocity dispersion exceeding 100 km s−1. As a result, only moderate fragmentation occurs in the inner 10–20 pc, despite the temperature falling below 1000 K. The SMD is Jeans-unstable as well as bar-unstable and will collapse further adiabatically, becoming warm and ionized. We show that the SMD, following inevitable contraction, will become general-relativistic-unstable and directly form a supermassive BH of mass in the range 106–108M⊙, essentially skipping the stage of BH seed formation. These results confirm that mergers between the most massive galaxies at z ∼ 8–10 can naturally explain the rapid emergence of bright high-redshift quasars.

<title>A Morphokinematic Study of the Enigmatic Emission Nebula NGC 6164/5 Surrounding the Magnetic O-type Star HD 148937</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
HD 148937 is a peculiar massive star (Of?p) with a strong magnetic field (1 kG). The hourglass-shaped emission nebula NGC 6164/5 surrounds this star. This nebula is presumed to originate from episodic mass-loss events of the central O-type star, but the detailed formation mechanism is not yet well understood. Grasping its three-dimensional structure is essential to uncovering the origin of this nebula. Here we report the high-resolution multiobject spectroscopic observations of NGC 6164/5 using the GIRAFFE on the 8.2 m Very Large Telescope. Integrated intensity maps constructed from several spectral lines delineate well the overall shape of this nebula, such as the two bright lobes and the inner gas region. The position–velocity diagrams show that the two bright lobes are found to be redshifted and blueshifted, respectively, while the inner region has multiple layers. We consider a geometric model composed of a bilateral outflow harboring nitrogen-enriched knots and expanding inner shells. Its spectral features are then simulated by using a Monte Carlo radiative transfer technique for different sets of velocities. Some position–velocity diagrams from simulations are very similar to the observed ones. According to the model that best reproduces the observational data, the two bright lobes and the nitrogen-enriched knots are moving away from HD 148937 at about 120 km s−1. Their minimum kinematic age is estimated to be about 7500 yr. We discuss possible formation mechanisms of this nebula in the context of binary interaction.

<title>Observations of Electron Secondary Reconnection in Magnetic Reconnection Front</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Magnetic reconnection, a fundamental plasma process transforming magnetic field energy into particle energy, is ubiquitous in space and responsible for many explosive phenomena, such as solar flares and gamma-ray bursts. Recent numerical theories have predicted that reconnection fronts far from the primary reconnection region can host secondary reconnection in three-dimensional scenarios, different from the conventional two-dimensional diagram where only one X-line stands to sustain reconnection. In this study, we provide direct observational evidence for ongoing secondary reconnection in the reconnection front via the unprecedentedly high-cadence data from NASA’s MMS mission. The secondary reconnection is identified by the presence of an X-line, a super-Alfvénic electron jet, and nonideal energy dissipation. Different from the primary ion–electron reconnection, the secondary reconnection is electron-only, with its X-line quasi-perpendicular to the primary X-line. Hence reconnection, when evolving from local to global scales, becomes essentially three-dimensional with different patterns developed. These results provide crucial insights into understanding cross-scale energy transport driven by reconnection in space plasmas.

<title>Assessing the Observability of Deep Meridional Flow Cells in the Solar Interior</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Meridional circulation regulates the Sun’s interior dynamics and magnetism. While it is well accepted that meridional flows are poleward at the Sun’s surface, helioseismic observations have yet to provide a definitive answer for the depth at which those flows return to the equator, or the number of circulation cells in depth. Here, we explore the observability of multiple circulation cells stacked in radius. Specifically, we examine the seismic signature of several meridional flow profiles by convolving time–distance averaging kernels with mean flows obtained from a suite of 3D hydrodynamic simulations. At mid and high latitudes, we find that weak flow structures in the deep convection zone can be obscured by signals from the much stronger surface flows. This contamination of 1–2 m s−1 is caused by extended side lobes in the averaging kernels, which produce a spurious equatorward signal with flow speeds that are 1 order of magnitude stronger than the original flow speeds in the simulations. At low latitudes, the flows in the deep layers of the simulations are stronger (&gt;2 m s−1) and multiple cells across the convection zone can produce a sufficiently strong signal to survive the convolution process. Now that meridional flows can be measured over two decades of data, the uncertainties arising from convective noise have fallen to a level where they are comparable in magnitude to the systematic biases caused by nonlocal features in the averaging kernels. Hence, these systematic errors are beginning to influence current helioseismic deductions and need broader consideration.

<title>Constraints on Solar Wind Density and Velocity Based on Coronal Tomography and Parker Solar Probe Measurements</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1506</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1506</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Previous work has established an empirical relationship between densities gained from coronal rotational tomography near the ecliptic plane with solar wind outflow speeds at heliocentric distance r0 = 8R⊙. This work aims to include solar wind acceleration, and thus velocity profiles out to 1 au. Inner boundary velocities are given as a function of normalized tomographic densities, ρN, as {V}_{0}=\left(75\ast {e}^{-\left[5.2* {\rho }_{N}\right]}+108\right), and typically range from 100 to 180  km s−1. The subsequent acceleration is defined as V(r)={V}_{0}\left(1+{\alpha }_{\mathrm{IP}}\left[1-{e}^{\left(-\left[r-{r}_{0}\right]/{r}_{{\rm{H}}}\right)}\right]\right), with αIP ranging between 1.75 and 2.7, and rH between 50 and 35 R⊙ dependent on V0. These acceleration profiles approximate the distribution of in situ measurements by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and other measurements at 1 au. Between 2018 November and 2021 September these constraints are applied using the HUXt model and give good agreement with in situ observations at PSP, with a ∼6% improvement compared with using a simpler constant acceleration model previously considered. Given the known tomographical densities at 8 R⊙, we extrapolate density to 1 au using the model velocities and assuming mass flux conservation. Extrapolated densities agree well with OMNI measurements. Thus coronagraph-based estimates of densities define the ambient solar wind outflow speed, acceleration, and density from 8 R⊙ to at least 1 au. This sets a constraint on more advanced models, and a framework for forecasting that provides a valid alternative to the use of velocities derived from magnetic field extrapolations.

<div> Galactic globular cluster, Australia Telescope Compact Array, radio continuum survey, radio source, X-ray source
<br />总结: 本研究对47 Tucanae星团进行了超深度射电连续波观测，获得了迄今为止最深的星团射电图像。研究发现了一个与星团中心位置重合的微弱无线电源ATCA J002405.702-720452.361，并且可能与微弱X射线源有关。通过无线电、X射线、光学和紫外数据分析，排除了背景活跃星系核、色球活跃双星或白矮星双星等解释，认为该源可能是未发现的毫秒脉冲星或微弱的黑洞吸积体。如果X射线源与无线电源相关联，则黑洞活动基本平面表明黑洞质量约为54-6000太阳质量，表明这可能是中等质量黑洞或重型恒星质量黑洞。 <div>
We present the results of an ultradeep radio continuum survey, containing ∼480 hr of observations, of the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tucanae with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. This comprehensive coverage of the cluster allows us to reach rms noise levels of 1.19 μJy beam−1 at 5.5 GHz, 940 nJy beam−1 at 9 GHz, and 790 nJy beam−1 in a stacked 7.25 GHz image. This is the deepest radio image of a globular cluster and the deepest image ever made with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. We identify ATCA J002405.702-720452.361, a faint (6.3 ± 1.2 μJy at 5.5 GHz, 5.4 ± 0.9 μJy at 9 GHz), flat-spectrum (α = −0.31 ± 0.54) radio source that is positionally coincident with the cluster center and potentially associated with a faint X-ray source. No convincing optical counterpart was identified. We use radio, X-ray, optical, and UV data to show that explanations involving a background active galactic nucleus, a chromospherically active binary, or a binary involving a white dwarf are unlikely. The most plausible explanations are that the source is an undiscovered millisecond pulsar or a weakly accreting black hole. If the X-ray source is associated with the radio source, the fundamental plane of black-hole activity suggests a black hole mass of ∼54–6000 M⊙, indicating an intermediate-mass black hole or a heavy stellar-mass black hole.

We report the discovery of three Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite Objects of Interest (TOI) with signatures of pulsation, observed in more than one sector. Our main goal is to explore how large is the variety of classical pulsators such as δ Sct, γ Dor, RR Lyrae and Cepheid among TOI pulsators. The analysis reveals two stars with signatures of δ Sct and one of γ Dor, out of a sample of 3901 TOIs with available light curves (LCs). To date, there is a very scarce number of known pulsating stars hosting planets. The present finding also emerges as an exciting laboratory for studying different astrophysical phenomena, including the effects of star–planet interaction on pulsation and timing detection of planetary companions. We have also identified 16 TOI stars with periodicities and LCs morphology compatible with different classical pulsating classes, but for most of them, the dominant frequency signals originate from contaminating sources.

We present the Cardinal mock galaxy catalogs, a new version of the Buzzard simulation that has been updated to support ongoing and future cosmological surveys, including the Dark Energy Survey (DES), DESI, and LSST. These catalogs are based on a one-quarter sky simulation populated with galaxies out to a redshift of z = 2.35 to a depth of mr = 27. Compared to the Buzzard mocks, the Cardinal mocks include an updated subhalo abundance matching model that considers orphan galaxies and includes mass-dependent scatter between galaxy luminosity and halo properties. This model can simultaneously fit galaxy clustering and group–galaxy cross-correlations measured in three different luminosity threshold samples. The Cardinal mocks also feature a new color assignment model that can simultaneously fit color-dependent galaxy clustering in three different luminosity bins. We have developed an algorithm that uses photometric data to further improve the color assignment model and have also developed a novel method to improve small-scale lensing below the ray-tracing resolution. These improvements enable the Cardinal mocks to accurately reproduce the abundance of galaxy clusters and the properties of lens galaxies in the DES data. As such, these simulations will be a valuable tool for future cosmological analyses based on large sky surveys.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章使用IRAM 30 m 望远镜对Sagittarius B2区域进行了观测，检测到了与生命起源密切相关的肽类分子。研究利用旋转图解法得出了HCONH2的激发温度和柱密度的空间分布，并推导出了CH3CONH2的柱密度。结果表明，在Sgr B2的分子包层中，激发温度的范围为6到46K。通过计算得出CH3CONH2/HCONH2和HCONH2/HNCO的丰度比，发现CH3CONH2在Sgr B2的西北部区域相对于HCONH2有所增加。此外，还检测到了H13CONH2，得出了12C/13C的比值为28.7。研究还使用了一个时变化的化学模型来解释HCONH2和CH3CONH2的丰度，最佳拟合结果表明尘埃温度为53-56K。需要在模型中包括更多的化学反应以解释观测到的丰度。 <div>
Peptide-like molecules, which have a close connection with the origin of life, have been detected in the Universe. Mapping observations of HCONH2 and CH3CONH2, two of the simplest peptide-like molecules, are performed toward the Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2) complex with the IRAM 30 m telescope. Seven transitions of HCONH2 and five transitions of CH3CONH2 are used in the analysis. The spatial distributions of the excitation temperature and column density of HCONH2 in the molecular envelope of Sgr B2 are obtained by rotation diagrams. Assuming the same excitation temperature of HCONH2, the column densities of CH3CONH2 are also calculated. The results show that the excitation temperature ranges from 6 to 46 K in the molecular envelope of Sgr B2. The abundance ratios between HCONH2 and CH3CONH2 are calculated to explore the relationship between them, as are those between HCONH2 and HNCO. The abundance ratio of CH3CONH2/HCONH2 varies from 10% to 20%, while that of HCONH2/HNCO ranges from 1.5% to 10%. CH3CONH2 is enhanced with respect to HCONH2 in the northwest region of Sgr B2. One transition of H13CONH2 is detected toward 12 positions of Sgr B2, from which a 12C/13C ratio of 28.7 is obtained. A time-dependent chemical model with a short-duration X-ray burst is used to explain the observed abundances of HCONH2 and CH3CONH2, with the best-fitting result at Tdust = 53–56 K. More chemical reactions are required to be included in the model since the modeled abundance is lower than the observed one at the observed Tdust.

<br />
Hess J1809-193是一个极高能γ射线源，被LHAASO和HAWC观测站在100 TeV能量以上探测到。它由超新星残骸、脉冲星和附近的分子云等天文现象组成，是探索γ射线产生机制的有趣候选对象。文章考虑了过去爆炸释放的高能宇宙射线注入，这些遗迹可能是HESS J1809-193范围内的SNR G011.0-00.0。他们解释了HESS J1809-193区域的多波段数据，包括宇宙射线电子的同步辐射、逆康普顿效应以及与当地分子云中的冷质子相互作用产生的次级γ射线。观测数据是基于时间演化的宇宙射线谱产生的次级光子进行建模，假设爆炸的年龄为4500年。

Hess J1809-193是一个极高能γ射线源，由LHAASO和HAWC观测到。文章讨论了宇宙射线注入、γ射线产生机制和观测数据建模。 <div>
The very-high-energy γ-ray source HESS J1809-193 has been detected by the LHAASO and HAWC observatory beyond 100 TeV energy. It is an interesting candidate for exploring the underlying mechanisms of γ-ray production due to the presence of supernova remnants, pulsars, and molecular clouds close to it. We have considered the injection of the energetic cosmic rays from a past explosion, whose reminiscent may be SNR G011.0-00.0, which is located within the extended γ-ray source HESS J1809-193. We explain the multiwavelength data from the region of HESS J1809-193 with synchrotron, inverse Compton, and bremsstrahlung emission of cosmic-ray electrons and secondary γ-ray production in interactions of cosmic-ray protons with the cold protons in the local molecular clouds within a time-dependent framework including the diffusion loss of cosmic rays. The observational data have been modeled with the secondary photons produced by the time-evolved cosmic-ray spectrum assuming the age of the explosion is 4500 yr.

总结:<br />
这篇论文旨在回答Alfvén波湍流加热在太阳大气模型中的物理过程如何展开在一个活动区的个体等离子体环中。通过对波耗散和反射、温度分布、加热比例定律和沿着环的能量平衡进行全面的统计调查，提供了对太阳下层大气能量分配的深入见解。研究表明，我们的3D全球模型与Alfvén波湍流加热的基于物理现象的公式得出的加热速率从环的脚点到顶部呈指数下降，这是过去文献中经验性假设的结果。还进行了对活动区的详细差分发射度（DEM）分析，并且与Hinode/极紫外成像光谱仪观测得到的DEM曲线相比，模拟结果良好。这是第一项使用高数值分辨率检验我们AWSoM模型的详细活动区能量学特性的工作，并进一步展示了低频Alfvén波湍流加热在产生活动区内实际等离子体性质和能量学方面的能力。 <div>
The coronal heating problem has been a major challenge in solar physics, and a tremendous amount of effort has been made over the past several decades to solve it. In this paper, we aim at answering how the physical processes behind the Alfvén wave turbulent heating adopted in the Alfvén Wave Solar atmosphere Model (AWSoM) unfold in individual plasma loops in an active region (AR). We perform comprehensive investigations in a statistical manner on the wave dissipation and reflection, temperature distribution, heating scaling laws, and energy balance along the loops, providing in-depth insights into the energy allocation in the lower solar atmosphere. We demonstrate that our 3D global model with a physics-based phenomenological formulation for the Alfvén wave turbulent heating yields a heating rate exponentially decreasing from loop footpoints to top, which had been empirically assumed in the past literature. A detailed differential emission measure (DEM) analysis of the AR is also performed, and the simulation compares favorably with DEM curves obtained from Hinode/Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer observations. This is the first work to examine the detailed AR energetics of our AWSoM model with high numerical resolution and further demonstrates the capabilities of low-frequency Alfvén wave turbulent heating in producing realistic plasma properties and energetics in an AR.

总结: 本文介绍了MIST项目，其旨在通过仿真观测研究土壤和MIST波束直达性对探测宇宙黎明时期的全球21厘米信号的影响。结果表明，单层土壤模型可以比较容易地恢复信号，而双层模型则更具挑战性，其中对底层土壤电导率较高的模型需要进行波束色散校正。这些结果将有助于选择有利于探测宇宙黎明信号的观测点。 <div>
The Mapper of the IGM Spin Temperature (MIST) is a new ground-based, single-antenna, radio experiment attempting to detect the global 21 cm signal from the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn. A significant challenge in this measurement is the frequency dependence, or chromaticity, of the antenna beam directivity. MIST observes with the antenna above the soil and without a metal ground plane, and the beam directivity is sensitive to the electrical characteristics of the soil. In this paper, we use simulated observations with MIST to study how the detection of the global 21 cm signal from Cosmic Dawn is affected by the soil and the MIST beam directivity. We simulate observations using electromagnetic models of the directivity computed for single- and two-layer models of the soil. We test the recovery of the Cosmic Dawn signal with and without beam chromaticity correction applied to the simulated data. We find that our single-layer soil models enable a straightforward recovery of the signal even without chromaticity correction. Two-layer models increase the beam chromaticity and make the recovery more challenging. However, for the model in which the bottom soil layer has a lower electrical conductivity than the top layer, the signal can be recovered even without chromaticity correction. For the other two-layer models, chromaticity correction is necessary for the recovery of the signal, and the accuracy requirements for the soil parameters vary between models. These results will be used as a guideline to select observation sites that are favorable for the detection of the Cosmic Dawn signal.

In this paper we explore the idea of using multi-spacecraft observations of Jovian electrons to measure the 3D distribution of these particles in the inner heliosphere. We present simulations of Jovian electron intensities along selected spacecraft trajectories for 2021 and compare these, admittedly qualitatively, to these measurements. Using the data–model comparison we emphasize how such a study can be used to constrain the transport parameters in the inner heliosphere, and how this can lead to additional insight into energetic particle transport. Model results are also shown along the expected trajectories of selected spacecraft, including the off-ecliptic phase of the Solar Orbiter mission from 2025 onward. Lastly, we revisit the use of historical data and discuss upcoming missions that may contribute to Jovian electron measurements.

总结: <br />
本研究利用Kodaikanal Solar Observatory（KoSO）的Ca ii K光谱图（1907-2007）进行分析，揭示了太阳色球的不同旋转速率以及与太阳黑子旋转速率的比较。研究发现，色球光辉区域的赤道旋转速率比光球快1.59%，纬度梯度也较小。此外，对罗马、梅东和蒙特威尔逊天文台的数据进行分析，结果支持了KoSO数据的发现。最后，研究未发现过去一个世纪色球的不同旋转存在显著的南北不对称或系统性变化。 <div>
Chromospheric differential rotation is a key component in comprehending the atmospheric coupling between the chromosphere and the photosphere at different phases of the solar cycle. In this study, we therefore utilize the newly calibrated multidecadal Ca ii K spectroheliograms (1907–2007) from the Kodaikanal Solar Observatory (KoSO) to investigate the differential rotation of the solar chromosphere using the technique of image cross-correlation. Our analysis yields the chromospheric differential rotation rate Ω(θ) = (14.61 ± 0.04–2.18 ± 0.37 {\sin }^{2}\theta -1.10\pm 0.61{\sin }^{4}\theta )^\circ day−1. These results suggest the chromospheric plages exhibit an equatorial rotation rate 1.59% faster than the photosphere when compared with the differential rotation rate measured using sunspots and also a smaller latitudinal gradient compared to the same. To compare our results to those from other observatories, we have applied our method on a small sample of Ca ii K data from Rome, Meudon, and Mount Wilson observatories, which support our findings from KoSO data. Additionally, we have not found any significant north–south asymmetry or any systematic variation in chromospheric differential rotation over the last century.

<div> 星系、环境影响、星体形成率、星体形成主序、质量抑制<br />
<br />
在这项研究中，我们使用完整质量的样本对低于4的红移z的约170k个星系进行了环境对星体形成活动的影响的系统研究。在z < 1时，我们发现所有星系的平均星体形成率（SFR）随着环境密度的增加而减少。然而，当我们只考虑星体形成星系时，平均SFR在z < 1时与环境无关。在z > 2时，我们观察到所有星系的SFR与环境密度之间存在明显的正相关关系。另一方面，星系的恒星质量在所有红移下除了z < 1的星体形成星系外都明显随环境增加。在z < 2时，隐化星系的比例随着环境密度的增加而增加，并且在z∼1附近确认了形态密度关系的存在。我们还发现在z > 1时，环境抑制可忽略，而质量抑制是所有红移下巨大星系的主要抑制机制。基于这些结果，我们认为恒星质量调节的物理过程可能是星系星体形成活动的主要驱动力。在低红移（z < 1）时，由于其较高质量，巨大星系主要被抑制，导致正常的SFR-密度关系。在高红移（z > 2）时，大多数星系都是紧密遵循星体形成主序的星体形成星系，它们在不同环境中的恒星质量差异自然导致SFR-密度关系的逆转。<br /><br />总结: 该研究使用了COSMOS2020目录中的大样本数据，发现了星系星体形成活动与环境密度的关系在不同红移下的变化规律。在低红移时，星体形成率与环境密度呈负相关，主要受到质量抑制的影响；而在高红移时，星体形成率与环境密度呈正相关，主要受到质量抑制和环境影响的共同作用。这一研究为我们了解星系形成演化过程提供了重要的参考。 <div>
We present a systematic study of the environmental impact on star formation activities of galaxies using a mass-complete sample of ∼170k galaxies at z &lt; 4 from the latest COSMOS2020 catalog. At z &lt; 1, we find that the mean star formation rate (SFR) of all galaxies decreases with increasing density of the environment. However, when we only consider star-forming galaxies, the mean SFR becomes independent of the environment at z &lt; 1. At z &gt; 2, we observe a clear positive correlation between the SFR and the density of the environment for all the galaxies. On the other hand, the stellar mass of the galaxies increases significantly with the environment at all redshifts except for star-forming galaxies at z &lt; 1. The fraction of quiescent galaxies increases with increasing density of the environment at z &lt; 2, and the morphology–density relation is confirmed to be present up to z ∼ 1. We also find that environmental quenching is negligible at z &gt; 1, whereas mass quenching is the dominant quenching mechanism for massive galaxies at all redshifts. Based on these results, we argue that stellar mass-regulated physical processes might be the major driving force for star formation activities of galaxies. At low redshift (z &lt; 1) massive galaxies are quenched primarily due to their high mass, resulting in a normal SFR–density relation. At high redshift (z &gt; 2) most of the galaxies are star-forming ones tightly following the star-forming main sequence, and the difference in their stellar mass in different environments naturally leads to a reversal of the SFR–density relation.

Here we report an optical quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) with a period of ∼134 days detected in g- and r-band light curves of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy TXS 1206+549 at a redshift of 1.34 with data from observations at the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). After considering the trial factor, the significance levels in the two bands are 3.1σ and 2.6σ, respectively. The QPO signal presents about 10 cycles ranging from 2018 March to 2021 December, thus lasting ∼4 yr. A nearly sinusoidal profile also appears in the folded light curves by using a phase-resolved analysis. Interestingly, in the simultaneous light curve with the timescale of ZTF observations, a potential periodic signal with a similar period is detected in the o-band light curve from Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System data; additionally, a weak peak is also detected at a similar period in the γ-ray light curve obtained from Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope data. Some potential origins of periodicities in active galactic nuclei are discussed for the QPO reported here.

星系形成和演化涉及各种在不同时间尺度上运行的有效随机过程。扩展的调节器模型提供了一个分析框架，用于解释由这些过程造成的星系整体恒星形成的变化（或“爆发性”）。它通过使用功率谱密度（PSD）形式主义，将Fourier空间中的变化性与影响巨大分子云的创造和破坏的随机气体流入、平衡和动力学过程的有效时间尺度联系起来。我们利用功率谱密度和自相关函数之间的连接，将这个模型重新表述为自相关函数，然后使用物理上有动机的高斯过程在对数恒星形成率（SFR）空间中对星系恒星形成史（SFHs）的变化性进行建模。然后，我们利用恒星群合成模型，探讨模型随机性的变化如何影响类似银河系和现今矮星的星系群在高红移下的光谱特征。我们发现，即使在固定的散射情况下，对随机性模型的干扰（改变时间尺度与总体变化性）也会在理想化和更真实的星系群中留下独特的光谱特征。基于Hubble空间望远镜、詹姆斯·韦伯空间望远镜和南希·格雷斯·罗曼空间望远镜的现有和未来调查，光谱特征的分布，包括基于Hα和紫外线的SFR指标、Hδ和Ca H和K吸收线强度、Dn(4000)和宽带颜色，提供了可验证的预测。高斯过程SFH框架为下一代光谱能量分布建模工具提供了一种快速、灵活的物理协方差模型的实现。可在https://github.com/kartheikiyer/GP-SFH找到用于重现我们结果的代码。<br /><br />总结: 该研究探讨了星系形成和演化中的随机过程，并提出了扩展的调节器模型来解释星系恒星形成的变化。这项研究使用物理上有动机的高斯过程在对数恒星形成率空间中对星系恒星形成史的变化性进行建模，并发现即使在固定的散射情况下，对随机性模型的干扰也会在星系群中留下独特的光谱特征。研究结果提供了对未来观测的可验证预测，并为下一代光谱能量分布建模工具提供了一种快速、灵活的实现。 <div>
Galaxy formation and evolution involve a variety of effectively stochastic processes that operate over different timescales. The extended regulator model provides an analytic framework for the resulting variability (or “burstiness”) in galaxy-wide star formation due to these processes. It does this by relating the variability in Fourier space to the effective timescales of stochastic gas inflow, equilibrium, and dynamical processes influencing giant molecular clouds' creation and destruction using the power spectral density (PSD) formalism. We use the connection between the PSD and autocovariance function for general stochastic processes to reformulate this model as an autocovariance function, which we use to model variability in galaxy star formation histories (SFHs) using physically motivated Gaussian processes in log star formation rate (SFR) space. Using stellar population synthesis models, we then explore how changes in model stochasticity can affect spectral signatures across galaxy populations with properties similar to the Milky Way and present-day dwarfs, as well as at higher redshifts. We find that, even at fixed scatter, perturbations to the stochasticity model (changing timescales vs. overall variability) leave unique spectral signatures across both idealized and more realistic galaxy populations. Distributions of spectral features including Hα and UV-based SFR indicators, Hδ and Ca H and K absorption-line strengths, Dn(4000), and broadband colors provide testable predictions for galaxy populations from present and upcoming surveys with the Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. The Gaussian process SFH framework provides a fast, flexible implementation of physical covariance models for the next generation of spectral energy distribution modeling tools.

总结:<br /><br />这篇论文介绍了Shack-Hartmann波前传感器(SH-WFS)在扩展目标上的理论分析，特别关注了归一化交叉相关(NCC)算法的实施。通过利用NCC算法的计算公式直接表达相关函数矩阵中最大值的坐标，以获得准确的误差描述。此外，通过误差传递函数确定了质心位置的方差，量化了测量误差。与Michau等人之前的发现相比，我们的结果显示出系数差异，具体结果比其工作高出1.5倍。广泛的太阳颗粒模拟和实验结果验证了理论误差公式。这些误差公式可以有效地估计SH-WFS的准确度，为光学系统设计提供了理论基础。 <div>
Correlating the Shack–Hartmann wave front sensor (SH-WFS) with extended targets is widely used in solar adaptive optics systems. This paper aims to introduce a theoretical analysis that evaluates the accuracy of the SH-WFS on extended sources, with a specific focus on the implementation of the Normalized Cross-correlation (NCC) algorithm. To obtain an accurate error description, we utilized the calculation formula of the NCC algorithm to directly express the coordinates of the maximum value in the correlation function matrix. Furthermore, we determined the variance of the centroid position through the error transfer function, which quantifies the measurement error. In comparison with the previous findings of Michau et al., our result exhibits a coefficient disparity, specifically obtaining results 1.5 times higher than their work. The extensive solar granulation simulation and experimental results validate the theoretical error formulas. These error formulas can effectively estimate the accuracy of the SH-WFS, providing a theoretical foundation for the design of optical systems.

本研究利用自监督机器学习探索了高红移（z ≥ 3）的星系形态多样性，在TNG50模拟中校准的数据驱动星系形态表示方案显示出对噪声的鲁棒性，并与模拟星系的物理性质（包括其3D结构）良好相关。对JWST/NIRCam CEERS数据发布的3 ≤ z ≤ 6质量完备样本的F200W和F356W星系图像应用该方法，发现模拟和观测星系在对比学习的表示空间中并不完全相同。同时发现被分类为盘状星系的一半星系与TNG50模拟中具有低恒星特定角动量和非椭球结构的星系位于表示空间的类似区域。尽管数据驱动研究无法确定这些星系的真实性质，但暗示高红移时期的盘状星系比传统监督分类可能被高估。深入的成像和光谱跟进以及与其他模拟的比较将有助于明确确定这些星系的真实性质，并建立更可靠的限制高红移时期盘状星系的出现。

Visual inspections of the first optical rest-frame images from JWST have indicated a surprisingly high fraction of disk galaxies at high redshifts. Here, we alternatively apply self-supervised machine learning to explore the morphological diversity at z ≥ 3. Our proposed data-driven representation scheme of galaxy morphologies, calibrated on mock images from the TNG50 simulation, is shown to be robust to noise and to correlate well with the physical properties of the simulated galaxies, including their 3D structure. We apply the method simultaneously to F200W and F356W galaxy images of a mass-complete sample (M*/M⊙ &gt; 109) at 3 ≤ z ≤ 6 from the first JWST/NIRCam CEERS data release. We find that the simulated and observed galaxies do not exactly populate the same manifold in the representation space from contrastive learning. We also find that half the galaxies classified as disks—either convolutional neural network-based or visually—populate a similar region of the representation space as TNG50 galaxies with low stellar specific angular momentum and nonoblate structure. Although our data-driven study does not allow us to firmly conclude on the true nature of these galaxies, it suggests that the disk fraction at z ≥ 3 remains uncertain and possibly overestimated by traditional supervised classifications. Deeper imaging and spectroscopic follow-ups as well as comparisons with other simulations will help to unambiguously determine the true nature of these galaxies, and establish more robust constraints on the emergence of disks at very high redshift.

在哈勃边缘场进行的最新紫外线亮度函数（UVLF）分析通过对前景透镜星团后面的数据加以研究，帮助确立了z∼5-9 UVLF的微弱端估计，比在场内还要暗5等星。这些测量结果提供了有关低亮度星系在宇宙再电离中的作用的宝贵信息，有助于校准JWST观测的预期。我们将半经验模型拟合到来自哈勃的透镜和先前UVLF数据，并对再电离期间的平均恒星形成效率（SFE）进行约束，透镜UVLF测量探测到的暗物质尺度达到M∼2×10^9M⊙。隐含的SFE随暗物质质量的趋势与先前在M≳10^10M⊙的推断外推一致，尽管联合数据更倾向于较浅的SFE。然而，这种偏好部分受透镜测量的系统不确定性影响。在z∼6附近，我们发现SFE在∼10^11和10^12M⊙之间达到约20％的峰值。我们的最佳拟合模型与Planck2020确定的电子散射光学厚度值一致，并且与大多数当前的再电离历史测量结果一致，前提是离子化光子的逃逸分数fesc∼10％-20％。联合UVLF在z∼8附近占再电离光子预算的近80％。最后，我们表明，对于Z≳11的最新JWST UVLF估计需要与哈勃数据所暗示的红移演化有着显著偏离。 <br /><br />总结: UVLF分析帮助确立了z∼5-9 UVLF的微弱端估计，对于再电离和JWST观测有重要影响。测量结果约束了恒星形成效率及其与暗物质质量的关系，并表明在z∼6附近SFE达到峰值。最佳拟合模型与Planck2020确定的电子散射光学厚度值一致，并且联合UVLF占了再电离光子预算的近80％。最新JWST UVLF估计与哈勃数据有着显著偏离。 <div>
A recent ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF) analysis in the Hubble Frontier Fields, behind foreground lensing clusters, has helped solidify estimates of the faint-end of the z ∼ 5–9 UVLF at up to 5 mag fainter than in the field. These measurements provide valuable information regarding the role of low-luminosity galaxies in reionizing the universe and can help in calibrating expectations for JWST observations. We fit a semiempirical model to the lensed and previous UVLF data from Hubble. This fit constrains the average star formation efficiency (SFE) during reionization, with the lensed UVLF measurements probing halo mass scales as small as M ∼ 2 × 109M⊙. The implied trend of SFE with halo mass is broadly consistent with an extrapolation from previous inferences at M ≳ 1010M⊙, although the joint data prefer a shallower SFE. This preference, however, is partly subject to systematic uncertainties in the lensed measurements. Near z ∼ 6, we find that the SFE peaks at ∼20% between ∼1011 and 1012M⊙. Our best-fit model is consistent with the Planck 2020 determinations of the electron scattering optical depth, and most current reionization history measurements, provided the escape fraction of ionizing photons is fesc ∼ 10%–20%. The joint UVLF accounts for nearly 80% of the ionizing photon budget at z ∼ 8. Finally, we show that recent JWST UVLF estimates at z ≳ 11 require strong departures from the redshift evolution suggested by the Hubble data.

We  present the demography of the dynamics and gas mass fraction of 33 extremely metal-poor galaxies (EMPGs) with metallicities of 0.015–0.195 Z⊙ and low stellar masses of 104–108M⊙ in the local universe. We conduct deep optical integral field spectroscopy (IFS) for the low-mass EMPGs with the medium-high resolution (R = 7500) grism of the 8 m Subaru FOCAS IFU instrument by the EMPRESS 3D survey, and investigate the Hα emission of the EMPGs. Exploiting the resolution high enough for the low-mass galaxies, we derive gas dynamics with the Hα lines by the fitting of three-dimensional disk models. We obtain an average maximum rotation velocity (vrot) of 15 ± 3 km s−1 and an average intrinsic velocity dispersion (σ0) of 27 ± 10 km s−1 for 15 spatially resolved EMPGs out of 33 EMPGs, and find that all 15 EMPGs have vrot/σ0 &lt; 1 suggesting dispersion-dominated systems. There is a clear decreasing trend of vrot/σ0 with the decreasing stellar mass and metallicity. We derive the gas mass fraction (fgas) for all 33 EMPGs, and find no clear dependence on stellar mass and metallicity. These vrot/σ0 and fgas trends should be compared with young high-z galaxies observed by the forthcoming JWST IFS programs to understand the physical origins of the EMPGs in the local universe.

总结:<br /><br />本研究利用上海天马射电望远镜在8600 MHz观测到了9颗毫秒脉冲星(MSPs)，并成功获取了它们的综合脉冲轮廓。通过对2250 MHz观测数据进行更新，本研究扩大了已发表综合轮廓的MSPs数量，包括了之前没有相关结果的七颗MSPs。通过对新的流量密度和脉冲宽度测量结果与先前的低频结果进行比较，研究了MSPs在更广泛的频率范围内的综合轮廓演变和光谱特性。最后，本研究发现其中四颗MSPs的光谱不符合单一幂律，而是用断裂幂律来拟合。此外，研究发现PSR J1713+0747星的综合轮廓出现了显著变化，且频率增加时这种变化更为突出。相比星际介质的影响，作者更倾向于将这一事件解释为磁层发生的变化。同时，研究发现其综合轮廓在事件发生后可能直到多个日期才恢复到先前的状态。 <div>
We report detection results of nine millisecond pulsars (MSPs) at 8600 MHz using simultaneous 2250 and 8600 MHz observations conducted with the Shanghai Tian Ma Radio Telescope. Mainly benefiting from updated ephemerids with 2250 MHz observations, integrated profiles of all nine MSPs at 8600 MHz are successfully obtained by coherently adding multi-epoch (3–83 epochs) observation data spanning from 19–1210 days, which significantly increases the number of MSPs with published profiles (from 4 to 11) above 8000 MHz, as seven of our target MPSs had no related results previously. Combining our new flux density and pulse width measurements with previous low-frequency results, we study their integrated profile evolution and spectral behaviors in a wider frequency range. We find their component separations and pulse widths remain almost constant, which is consistent with previous findings. While dramatic evolution of integrated profiles exists at low frequencies, we observe a potential end of the related evolution around 5 GHz in eight MSPs. The spectra of four MSPs are found to deviate from a single power law, and we fit them with a broken power law. The change in the profile of PSR J1713+0747, which started around MJD 59320−59321, seems to be more prominent as the observation frequency increases. Compared with the effects of the interstellar medium, we prefer to explain this event as some changes in the magnetosphere. We also find its integrated profile possibly had not recovered to the pre-event state until MJD 59842–59857.

Some supernovae (SNe) are powered by the collision of the SN ejecta with dense circumstellar matter (CSM). Their emission spectra show characteristic line shapes of combined broad emission and narrow P Cygni lines, which should closely relate to the CSM structure and the mass-loss mechanism that creates the dense CSM. We quantitatively investigate the relationship between the line shape and the CSM structure by Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations, considering two representative cases of dense CSM formed by steady and eruptive mass loss. Comparing the Hα emission between the two cases, we find that a narrow P Cygni line appears in the eruptive case but does not appear in the steady case due to the difference in the velocity gradient in the dense CSM. We also reproduce the blueshifted photon excess observed in some Type IIn SNe, which is formed by photon transport across the shock wave, and find the relationship between the velocity of the shocked matter and the amount of blueshift of the photon excess. We conclude that the presence or absence of narrow P Cygni lines can distinguish the mass-loss mechanism and suggest high-resolution spectroscopic observations with λ/Δλ ≳ 104 after the light-curve peak for applying this diagnostic method.

<div> 孤立卫星星系，TNG50-1 模拟，lopsided形态，径向对齐，长轴比率

在这项工作中，我们对TNG50-1模拟生成的1780个孤立卫星星系进行了lopsided形态的统计分析，考虑了来自暗物质晕中心的潮汐场效应。孤立卫星星系指的是在其维里半径内质量超过1%的星系，且周围没有邻近子结构。我们研究了卫星星系的主轴与其暗物质晕中心径向方向之间的径向对齐（RA），分别在0-2、2-5和5-10 Rh（Rh为星体的半质量半径）的径向范围内进行研究。根据我们的结果，在内部和中间区域，径向对齐几乎无法检测到，但在外部区域明显存在。我们还计算了主轴的远端与近端半轴比率a-/a+，它衡量了面向暗物质晕中心（远端）和背向暗物质晕中心（近端）的半轴比率。在所有卫星星系的径向区间内，远端较长半轴的卫星数量几乎等于近端较长半轴的卫星数量。因此，暗物质晕中心的潮汐场在形成lopsided卫星星系中起到了较小的作用。我们进一步研究了长半长轴径向对齐（LRA），即卫星星系的长半长轴与其暗物质晕中心径向方向的对齐情况。在ΛCDM牛顿动力学框架内，我们的样本中没有发现明确的LRA证据。最后，我们简要讨论了TNG50-1模拟中星系不对称的可能起源。

Galaxies are observed to be lopsided, meaning that they are more massive and more extended along one side than the opposite side. In this work, we provide a statistical analysis of the lopsided morphology of 1780 isolated satellite galaxies generated by the TNG50-1 simulation, incorporating the effect of tidal fields from halo centers. The isolated satellites are galaxies without nearby substructures whose mass is over 1% of the satellites within their virial radii. We study the radial alignment (RA) between the major axes of satellites and the radial direction of their halo centers in radial ranges of 0–2, 2–5, and 5–10 Rh, with Rh being the stellar half-mass radius. According to our results, the RA is virtually undetectable in inner and intermediate regions, yet it is significantly evident in outer regions. We also calculate the far-to-near-side semiaxial ratios of the major axes, denoted by a−/a+, which measure the semiaxial ratios of the major axes in the hemispheres between those facing away from (far side) and facing toward (nearside) halo centers. In all the radial bins of the satellites, the numbers of satellites with longer semiaxes on the far side are found to be almost equal to those with longer semiaxes on the near side. Therefore, the tidal fields from halo centers play a minor role in the generation of lopsided satellites. The long semimajor-axes radial alignment (LRA), i.e., an alignment between the long semimajor axes of satellite galaxies and the radial directions to their halo centers, is further studied. No clear evidence of LRA is found in our sample within the framework of ΛCDM Newtonian dynamics. Finally, we briefly discuss the possible origins of the asymmetry of galaxies in TNG50-1.

The physical origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is still unclear. However, young magnetars associated with short-duration gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) have been thought to be possible central engines for some FRBs. In this paper, we perform a systematic search for SGRBs that are associated with FRBs in a sample including 623 FRBs (601 one-off bursts and 22 repeaters) and 168 SGRBs with precise localizations. We find that FRB 190309A is spatially associated with GRB 060502B, with a chance probability of 0.05 when temporal and redshift information is taken into account. Considering the high chance probability (the statistical significance is &lt;3σ), we examine other observational properties such as the host galaxy, the dispersion measure, and the energy budget of the central engine to check the possibility of their association. Although the available observational information is insufficient to determine whether they are physically associated, it does not rule out such a possibility. As the only pair of FRB and GRB that are spatially associated, it remains an interesting case worthy of further attention.

<br /><br />总结: 本研究通过观测FRB 20201124A和其宿主星系，发现宿主星系中存在大量星体形成，比光学观测推测的星体形成高出2.5-6倍，显示星体形成受尘埃影响。同时，射电观测显示FRB位置延伸有射电发射。研究提出FRB可能源自星体形成区内的磁星，或者从宿主星系中央栏向外迁移而来。此外，对于FRB位置上的持续射电发射放射，对其亮度进行了限制，这一限制与磁星星云和超星云模型基本一致。 <div>
We present high-resolution 1.5–6 GHz Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical and infrared observations of the extremely active repeating fast radio burst (FRB) FRB 20201124A and its barred spiral host galaxy. We constrain the location and morphology of star formation in the host and search for a persistent radio source (PRS) coincident with FRB 20201124A. We resolve the morphology of the radio emission across all frequency bands and measure a star formation rate (SFR) ≈ 8.9 M⊙ yr−1, approximately ≈2.5–6 times larger than optically inferred SFRs, demonstrating dust-obscured star formation throughout the host. Compared to a sample of all known FRB hosts with radio emission, the host of FRB 20201124A has the most significantly obscured star formation. While HST observations show the FRB to be offset from the bar or spiral arms, the radio emission extends to the FRB location. We propose that the FRB progenitor could have formed in situ (e.g., a magnetar born from a massive star explosion). It is still plausible, although less likely, that the progenitor of FRB 20201124A migrated from the central bar of the host. We further place a limit on the luminosity of a putative PRS at the FRB position of L6.0GHz ≲ 1.8 ×1027 erg s−1 Hz−1, among the deepest PRS luminosity limits to date. However, this limit is still broadly consistent with both magnetar nebulae and hypernebulae models assuming a constant energy injection rate of the magnetar and an age of ≳105 yr in each model, respectively.

<title>Star Formation Efficiency in Nearby Galaxies Revealed with a New CO-to-H2 Conversion Factor Prescription</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad10ae</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Determining how the galactic environment, especially the high gas densities and complex dynamics in bar-fed galaxy centers, alters the star formation efficiency (SFE) of molecular gas is critical to understanding galaxy evolution. However, these same physical or dynamical effects also alter the emissivity properties of CO, leading to variations in the CO-to-H2 conversion factor (αCO) that impact the assessment of the gas column densities and thus of the SFE. To address such issues, we investigate the dependence of αCO on the local CO velocity dispersion at 150 pc scales using a new set of dust-based αCO measurements and propose a new αCO prescription that accounts for CO emissivity variations across galaxies. Based on this prescription, we estimate the SFE in a sample of 65 galaxies from the PHANGS–Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array survey. We find increasing SFE toward high-surface-density regions like galaxy centers, while using a constant or metallicity-based αCO results in a more homogeneous SFE throughout the centers and disks. Our prescription further reveals a mean molecular gas depletion time of 700 Myr in the centers of barred galaxies, which is overall three to four times shorter than in nonbarred galaxy centers or the disks. Across the galaxy disks, the depletion time is consistently around 2–3 Gyr, regardless of the choice of αCO prescription. All together, our results suggest that the high level of star formation activity in barred centers is not simply due to an increased amount of molecular gas, but also to an enhanced SFE compared to nonbarred centers or disk regions.

<title>Comparing Plasma Anisotropy Associated with Solar Wind Discontinuities and Alfvénic Fluctuations</title>

Solar wind magnetic field fluctuations exhibit a complex multiscale nature, often encompassing ion-scale discontinuities and MHD-scale Alfvénic fluctuations. Both of these types of structures are thought to play a critical role in plasma heating and turbulence dissipation. Here we comparatively analyze the plasma pressure anisotropies within discontinuities and adjacent Alfvénic fluctuations, leveraging unique solar wind observations from orbit conjunctions between the ARTEMIS and WIND missions, along the same flow streamline, though about 150 Earth radii apart. Based on 11 cases of such observations, we compare direct measurements of plasma anisotropy from particle instruments with its estimates from anisotropic MHD theory using the ratios of correlated ion velocity and Alfvén speed variations Δvi/ΔvA. We find that (1) sporadically observed discontinuities associated with bifurcated reconnection current sheets harbor significant parallel electron anisotropies of &gt;0.2; (2) direct electron measurements in all events reveal a median anisotropy of ∼0.07 for Alfvénic fluctuations and ∼0.17 for discontinuities; (3) anisotropic MHD predicts even more disparate total anisotropies within Alfvénic fluctuations and discontinuities, with a median value of ∼0.15 for the former and ∼0.57 for the latter; (4) the differences between theory-predicted and directly measured anisotropies imply that the ion contribution to anisotropy is significant and likely dominant within both types of structures, an assertion which we partly verify using simultaneous ion measurements from WIND. Our observations confirm that such discontinuities play a uniquely important role in producing solar wind plasma heating and anisotropy.

HM Sge是一个尘埃丰富的共生Mira系统，研究表明，这个系统在1975年的新星状爆发之后经历了迅速的演化，表现出一些有趣的特征。首次利用新的EXES高光谱分辨率红外光谱技术探测到了共生系统中的rovibrational水发射。该特征显示出一定的速度但没有明显的高速流出现。中红外光度测量和光谱学显示，氧丰富的巨星支系尘埃和尘埃产量在过去39年中几乎没有变化。在光学/紫外线范围内，检测到了三个主要的[N II]星云特征，其中两个特征显示出一定的运动，相对于之前观测到的平均流出速度为38和78 km/s；一些之前检测到的[N II]特征已不再可见。新的紫外线光谱表明，该星云环境在1975年的爆发后继续稳定放松。然而，数据表明热组分的温度从1989年的200,000K增加到目前大于250,000K。我们的新和存档观测表明，系统在爆发后经历的演化是迅速的，几年后几乎没有重大变化。

We have targeted the dusty symbiotic Mira system HM Sge with four instruments from the IR to the UV. We have used these observations along with archival observations to study how the system has been evolving after its 1975 nova-like outburst. We have detected rovibrational water emission in a symbiotic system for the first time using new EXES high-spectral-resolution infrared spectroscopy. The features, detected in emission, have velocities consistent with the systemic velocity but do not show any clear evidence of high-velocity outflows. Mid-infrared photometry and grism spectroscopy show that the oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch dust and dust output have shown little to no change over the past 39 years. In the optical/UV, we detect three main [N ii] nebular features that were detected 22 years ago. Two of these features show a small amount of movement, corresponding to average outflows speeds of 38 and 78 km s−1 since they were previously observed; some previously detected [N ii] features are no longer visible. New UV spectroscopy has shown that the nebular environment continues to steadily relax after the system’s 1975 outburst. The data suggest, however, that the temperature of the hot component has increased from 200,000 K in 1989 to greater than 250,000 K now. Our new and archival observations suggest that the evolution of the system after its outburst is swift with little to no major changes after a period of a couple of years.

<div> HST-dark galaxies, infrared imaging, JWST, radiative transfer, high-redshift<br />
<br />
HST-dark galaxies是指在深度光学-近红外成像中不可见，但在较长波长下被探测到的星系，最近的观测研究表明它们可能构成了一个数量可观的缺失星系群体，并且在z≳4时可能主导宇宙的星系形成率密度。这篇文章进行了首次基于模拟的研究，利用Feedback in Realistic Environments项目中高分辨率星系的模拟，通过辐射传递进行了多波段成像。研究发现，HST-dark galaxies通常位于高红移（z=4-7），有较高的尘埃衰减水平（AV=2-4），并展现出紧凑的近期星系形成。此外，研究还指出了方向性的重要性，对于大部分模拟的星系快照来说，存在一定视线并不符合选择标准。这一结果对于那些不能解析星尘几何结构的观测和模型（例如半解析模型或粗略解析的流体动力学模拟）之间的比较具有重要意义。最重要的是，研究证明HST-dark sources并不是意外或奇特的星系群体，而是在某些视线下观察到的高红移、高度尘埃衰减的星系的子集。 <br /><br />总结: HST-dark galaxies是在光学-近红外成像中不可见但在较长波长下被探测到的星系群体，主要研究了这些星系的模拟和特征，并发现了它们的环境位置、尘埃衰减和星系形成特征，同时也指出了观测和模型比较中方向性的重要性。 <div>
Galaxies that are invisible in deep optical–near-infrared imaging but detected at longer wavelengths have been the focus of several recent observational studies, with speculation that they could constitute a substantial missing population and even dominate the cosmic star formation rate density at z ≳ 4. The depths now achievable with JWST at the longest wavelengths probed by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), coupled with the transformative resolution at longer wavelengths, are already enabling detailed, spatially resolved characterization of sources that were invisible to HST, often known as “HST-dark” galaxies. However, until now, there has been little theoretical work to compare against. We present the first simulation-based study of this population, using highly resolved galaxies from the Feedback in Realistic Environments project, with multiwavelength images along several lines of sight forward-modeled using radiative transfer. We naturally recover a population of modeled sources that meet commonly used selection criteria (HAB &gt; 27 mag and HAB − F444W &gt; 2.3). These simulated HST-dark galaxies lie at high redshifts (z = 4–7), have high levels of dust attenuation (AV = 2–4), and display compact recent star formation (R1/2,4.4 μm ≲ 1 kpc). Orientation is very important: for all but one of the 17 simulated galaxy snapshots with HST-dark sight lines, there exist other sight lines that do not meet the criteria. This result has important implications for comparisons between observations and models that do not resolve the detailed star-dust geometry, such as semianalytic models or coarsely resolved hydrodynamical simulations. Critically, we demonstrate that HST-dark sources are not an unexpected or exotic population, but a subset of high-redshift, highly dust-attenuated sources viewed along certain lines of sight.

总结:
本研究利用ROSAT 1RXS和2RXS数据集以及Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 17等伴随多波段调查数据，拓展了以往对空白区域X射线源候选XINSs的搜索，最终找到了两个已知的XINSs，同时识别出46个新的候选区域。文章描述了选择方法并提供了新候选XINSs样本的详细信息。还讨论了通过获得更精确的X射线源位置、优质X射线光谱或更深入的光学成像来验证或推翻这些X射线源是否为孤立中子星的未来可能。 <div>
The current sample of 12 radio-quiet isolated neutron stars that emit strongly in X-rays (XINSs) is both small and heterogeneous, limiting its usefulness for understanding the physics of neutron star atmospheres and cooling rates and for constraining the equation of state of neutron degenerate matter. Utilizing the ROSAT 1RXS and 2RXS data sets, in conjunction with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 17 and other companion multiwavelength surveys, we have extended previous searches for blank-field X-ray source candidate XINSs, ultimately recovering two known XINSs while identifying 46 new, unstudied candidate fields devoid of likely multiwavelength counterparts. In this publication, we describe our selection approach and provide detailed information regarding our sample of new candidate XINSs. Future opportunities to verify or to refute these X-ray sources as isolated neutron stars by obtaining more accurate X-ray source positions, quality X-ray spectra, or deeper optical imaging are also discussed.

Compositional convection is atmospheric mixing driven by density variations caused by compositional gradients. Previous studies have suggested that compositional gradients of atmospheric trace species within planetary atmospheres can impact convection and the final atmospheric temperature profile. In this work, we employ 3D convection-resolving simulations using Cloud Model 1 (CM1) to gain a fundamental understanding of how compositional variation influences convection and the final atmospheric state of exoplanet atmospheres. We perform 3D initial value problem simulations of noncondensing compositional convection for Earth-air, H2, and CO2 atmospheres. Conventionally, atmospheric convection is assumed to mix the atmosphere to a final, marginally stable state defined by a unique temperature profile. However, when there is compositional variation within an atmosphere, a continuous family of stable end states is possible, differing in the final state composition profile. Our CM1 simulations are used to determine which of the family of possible compositional end states is selected. Leveraging the results from our CM1 simulations, we develop a dry convective adjustment scheme for use in general circulation models (GCMs). This scheme relies on an energy analysis to determine the final adjusted atmospheric state. Our convection scheme produces results that agree with our CM1 simulations and can easily be implemented in GCMs to improve modeling of compositional convection in exoplanet atmospheres.

Low-frequency gravitational-wave experiments such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna and pulsar timing arrays are expected to detect individual massive black hole (MBH) binaries and mergers. However, secure methods of identifying the exact host galaxy of each MBH merger among the large number of galaxies in the gravitational-wave localization region are currently lacking. We investigate the distinct morphological signatures of MBH merger host galaxies, using the Romulus25 cosmological simulation. We produce mock telescope images of 201 simulated galaxies in Romulus25 hosting recent MBH mergers through stellar population synthesis and dust radiative transfer. Based on comparisons to mass- and redshift-matched control samples, we show that combining multiple morphological statistics via a linear discriminant analysis enables identification of the host galaxies of MBH mergers, with accuracies that increase with chirp mass and mass ratio. For mergers with high chirp masses (≳108.2M⊙) and high mass ratios (≳0.5), the accuracy of this approach reaches ≳80%, and does not decline for at least ∼1 Gyr after numerical merger. We argue that these trends arise because the most distinctive morphological characteristics of MBH merger and binary host galaxies are prominent classical bulges, rather than relatively short-lived morphological disturbances from their preceding galaxy mergers. Since these bulges are formed though major mergers of massive galaxies, they lead to (and become permanent signposts for) MBH binaries and mergers that have high chirp masses and mass ratios. Our results suggest that galaxy morphology can aid in identifying the host galaxies of future MBH binaries and mergers.

We present a semi-analytic model for the growth, drift, desorption, and fragmentation of millimeter- to meter-sized particles in protoplanetary disks. Fragmentation occurs where particle collision velocities exceed critical fragmentation velocities. Using this criterion, we produce fragmentation regions in disk orbital radius–particle size phase space for particles with a range of material properties, structures, and compositions (including SiO2, Mg2SiO4, H2O, CO2, and CO). For reasonable disk conditions, compact aggregate H2O, CO2, and CO ice particles do not reach destructive relative velocities and are thus not likely to undergo collisional fragmentation. Uncoated silicate particles are more susceptible to collisional destruction and are expected to fragment in the inner disk, consistent with previous work. We then calculate the growth, drift, and sublimation of small particles, initially located in the outer disk. We find that ice-coated particles can avoid fragmentation as they grow and drift inward under a substantial range of disk conditions, as long as the particles are aggregates composed of 0.1 μm-sized monomers. Such particles may undergo runaway growth in disk regions abundant in H2O or CO2 ice, depending on the assumed disk temperature structure. These results indicate that icy collisional growth to planetesimally relevant sizes may happen efficiently throughout a disk’s lifetime, and is particularly robust at early times when the disk’s dust-to-gas ratio is comparable to that of the interstellar medium.

<div> 关键词: Type Ia supernova remnants, Tycho’s SNR, Chandra data, hydrodynamic simulations, mass-loss rate
总结:
超新星遗迹Tycho的SNR被认为是一个典型的对象，具有光谱、形态和环境特性的重要性。最近的Chandra数据重新分析显示，其前向激波自2007年以来经历了显著的减速，这表明最近的激波与密集介质的相互作用，导致分子云内部的空腔环境。本研究利用最新的多时期 proper motion 测量，进行了水动力学模拟，以表征Tycho的空腔壁环境。模拟中探索了环境的一系列参数，以与每个方位区域的观测数据相匹配。结果显示，ρ(r)∝r−2的风洞模型与最新数据相符，而常数密度的均匀介质模型则不佳。此外，最佳拟合模型支持具有方位角变化的各向异性风，整体结果表明质量损失速率异常高，不符合传统的单重变星爆炸方案。 <div>
Among Type Ia supernova remnants (SNRs), Tycho’s SNR has been considered as a typical object from the viewpoints of its spectroscopic, morphological, and environmental properties. A recent reanalysis of Chandra data showed that its forward shock is experiencing a substantial deceleration since around 2007, which suggests recent shock interactions with a dense medium as a consequence of a cavity-wall environment inside a molecular cloud. Such a nonuniform environment can be linked back to the nature and activities of its progenitor. In this study, we perform hydrodynamic simulations to characterize Tycho’s cavity-wall environment using the latest multiepoch proper motion measurements of the forward shock. A range of parameters for the environment is explored in the hydrodynamic models to fit with the observational data for each azimuthal region. Our results show that a wind-like cavity with ρ(r) ∝ r−2 reconciles with the latest data better than a uniform medium with a constant density. In addition, our best-fit model favors an anisotropic wind with an azimuthally varying wind parameter. The overall result indicates a mass-loss rate which is unusually high for the conventional single-degenerate explosion scenario.

We performed synthetic observations of the Ulrich, Cassen, and Moosman (UCM) model to understand the relation between the physical structures of the infalling envelope around a protostar and their observational features in molecular lines, adopting L1527 as an example. We also compared the physical structure and synthetic position–velocity (P–V) diagrams of the UCM model and a simple ballistic (SB) model. There are multiple ways to compare synthetic data with observational data. We first calculated the correlation coefficient. The UCM model and the SB model show similarly good correlation with the observational data. While the correlation reflects the overall similarity between the cube datasets, we can alternatively compare specific local features, such as the centrifugal barrier in the SB model or the centrifugal radius in the UCM model. We evaluated systematic uncertainties in these methods. In the case of L1527, the stellar mass values estimated using these methods are all lower than the value derived from previous Keplerian analysis of the disk. This may indicate that the gas infall motion in the envelope is retarded by, e.g., magnetic fields. We also showed analytically that, in the UCM model, the spin-up feature of the P–V diagram is due to the infall velocity rather than the rotation. The line-of-sight velocity V is thus ∝x−0.5, where x is the offset. If the infall is retarded, rotational velocity should dominate so that V is proportional to x−1, as is often observed in the protostellar envelope.

Current endeavours in exoplanet characterization rely on atmospheric retrieval to quantify crucial physical properties of remote exoplanets from observations. However, the scalability and efficiency of said technique are under strain with increasing spectroscopic resolution and forward model complexity. The situation has become more acute with the recent launch of the James Webb Space Telescope and other upcoming missions. Recent advances in machine learning provide optimization-based variational inference as an alternative approach to perform approximate Bayesian posterior inference. In this investigation we developed a normalizing-flow-based neural network, combined with our newly developed differentiable forward model, Diff-τ, to perform Bayesian inference in the context of atmospheric retrievals. Using examples from real and simulated spectroscopic data, we demonstrate the advantages of our proposed framework: (1) training our neural network does not require a large precomputed training set and can be trained with only a single observation; (2) it produces high-fidelity posterior distributions in excellent agreement with sampling-based retrievals; (3) it requires up to 75% fewer forward model calls to converge to the same result; and (4) this approach allows formal Bayesian model selection. We discuss the computational efficiencies of Diff-τ in relation to TauREx3's nominal forward model and provide a “lessons learned” account of developing radiative transfer models in differentiable languages. Our proposed framework contributes toward the latest development of neural network–powered atmospheric retrieval. Its flexibility and significant reduction in forward model calls required for convergence holds the potential to be an important addition to the retrieval tool box for large and complex data sets along with sampling-based approaches.

作者们使用了一种新的 Rolling Hough Transform (RHT) 算法来实现对球面上的纤维结构进行高效的量化。研究发现，对于模拟磁场结构最具信息量的 H i 结构是最细的解析纤维。他们还发现，一些星际形态可以产生奇异性违反的信号，即非零的 TB 和 EB。最后，他们证明了来自星际尘埃纤维的B模式主要受到纤维之间拓扑结构和相对极化强度的影响，而E模式主要受到单个纤维的形状的影响。 <div>
Filamentary structures in neutral hydrogen (H i) emission are well aligned with the interstellar magnetic field, so H i emission morphology can be used to construct templates that strongly correlate with measurements of polarized thermal dust emission. We explore how the quantification of filament morphology affects this correlation. We introduce a new implementation of the Rolling Hough Transform (RHT) using spherical harmonic convolutions, which enables efficient quantification of filamentary structure on the sphere. We use this Spherical RHT algorithm along with a Hessian-based method to construct H i-based polarization templates. We discuss improvements to each algorithm relative to similar implementations in the literature and compare their outputs. By exploring the parameter space of filament morphologies with the Spherical RHT, we find that the most informative H i structures for modeling the magnetic field structure are the thinnest resolved filaments. For this reason, we find a ∼10% enhancement in the B-mode correlation with polarized dust emission with higher-resolution H i observations. We demonstrate that certain interstellar morphologies can produce parity-violating signatures, i.e., nonzero TB and EB, even under the assumption that filaments are locally aligned with the magnetic field. Finally, we demonstrate that B modes from interstellar dust filaments are mostly affected by the topology of the filaments with respect to one another and their relative polarized intensities, whereas E modes are mostly sensitive to the shapes of individual filaments.

While the most exciting explanation of the observed dust asymmetries in protoplanetary disks is the presence of protoplanets, other mechanisms can also form the dust features. This paper presents dual-wavelength Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of a large asymmetric dusty ring around the M-type star CIDA 9A. We detect a dust asymmetry in both 1.3 and 3.1 mm data. To characterize the asymmetric structure, a parametric model is used to fit the observed visibilities. We report a tentative azimuthal shift of the dust emission peaks between the observations at the two wavelengths. This shift is consistent with a dust trap caused by a vortex, which may be formed by an embedded protoplanet or other hydrodynamical instabilities, such as a dead zone. Deep high-spatial-resolution observations of dust and molecular gas are needed to constrain the mechanisms that formed the observed millimeter cavity and dust asymmetry in the protoplanetary disk around CIDA 9A.

The connection between galaxies and dark matter halos is often quantified using the stellar mass–halo mass (SMHM) relation. Optical and near-infrared imaging surveys have led to a broadly consistent picture of the evolving SMHM relation based on measurements of galaxy abundances and angular correlation functions. Spectroscopic surveys at z ≳ 2 can also constrain the SMHM relation via the galaxy autocorrelation function and through the cross-correlation between galaxies and Lyα absorption measured in transverse sight lines; however, such studies are very few and have produced some unexpected or inconclusive results. We use ∼3000 spectra of z ∼ 2.5 galaxies from the Lyα Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS) to measure the galaxy–galaxy and galaxy–Lyα correlation functions in four bins of stellar mass spanning 109.2 ≲ M*/M⊙ ≲ 1010.5. Parallel analyses of the MultiDark N-body and ASTRID hydrodynamic cosmological simulations allow us to model the correlation functions, estimate covariance matrices, and infer halo masses. We find that results of the two methods are mutually consistent and broadly accord with standard SMHM relations. This consistency demonstrates that we are able to measure and model Lyα transmission fluctuations δF in LATIS accurately. We also show that the galaxy–Lyα cross-correlation, a free by-product of optical spectroscopic galaxy surveys at these redshifts, can constrain halo masses with similar precision to galaxy–galaxy clustering.

In the latest data release from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (the 4th Fermi LAT 14 yr Catalog, or 4FGL), more than 50% of the Galactic sources are yet to be identified. We observed 13 unidentified Fermi LAT sources with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory to explore their nature. We report the results of the classification of X-ray sources in the fields of these γ-ray sources and discuss the implications for their nature. We use multiwavelength (MW) data for a machine-learning classification, accompanied by a more detailed spectral/variability analysis for brighter sources. Eight 4FGL sources have γ-ray pulsars within their position error ellipses. We consider three of these pulsars (PSR J1906+0722, PSR J1105–6037, and PSR J1358–6025) to be detected in X-rays, while PSR J1203–6242 shows a hint of X-ray emission. Within the positional uncertainties of three of the 4FGL sources, we detect X-ray sources that may be yet unknown pulsars, depending on the MW association. In addition to point sources, we discovered two extended sources, one of which is likely to be a bow-shock pulsar-wind nebula associated with PSR J1358–6025. Finally, we classify other X-ray sources detected in these observations and report the most interesting classifications.

<title>The Scaling of Vortical Electron Acceleration in Thin-current Magnetic Reconnection and Its Implications in Solar Flares</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad09e6</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To investigate how magnetic reconnection (MR) accelerates electrons to a power-law energy spectrum in solar flares, we explore the scaling of a kinetic model proposed by Che &amp; Zank (CZ) and compare it to observations. Focusing on thin current sheet MR particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we analyze the impact of domain size on the evolution of the electron Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (EKHI). We find that the duration of the growth stage of the EKHI ({t}_{G}\sim {{\rm{\Omega }}}_{e}^{-1}) is short and remains nearly unchanged because the electron gyrofrequency Ωe is independent of domain size. The quasi-steady stage of the EKHI (tMR) dominates the electron acceleration process and scales linearly with the size of the simulations as L/vA0, where vA0 is the Alfvén speed. We use the analytical results obtained by CZ to calculate the continuous temporal evolution of the electron energy spectra from PIC simulations and linearly scale them to solar flare observational scales. For the first time, an electron acceleration model predicts the sharp two-stage transition observed in typical soft–hard–harder electron energy spectra, implying that the electron acceleration model must be efficient with an acceleration timescale that is a small fraction of the duration of solar flares. Our results suggest that we can use PIC MR simulations to investigate the observational electron energy spectral evolution of solar flares if the ratio tMR/tG is sufficiently small, i.e., ≲10%.

<title>Evidence of Third Dredge-up in Post-AGB Stars in Galactic Globular Clusters</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad0a89</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To better understand the mixing and mass loss experienced by low-mass stars as they ascend the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), I have gathered from the literature the abundances of CNO and s-process elements in post-AGB stars in Galactic globular clusters. These species are mixed to the surface during third dredge-up (3DU) events, so their abundance should increase as the star ascends the AGB. Of the 17 stars in this sample, CNO abundances are available for 11. Of these, four are enhanced in CNO relative to the red giant branch stars from which they descended, which I take as evidence of 3DU on the AGB. The enhancement is mainly in the form of carbon. Of the six stars for which only heavy-element abundances are available, one shows s-process enhancements that previous authors have interpreted as evidence of 3DU. Combining these 17 stars with other recent samples reveals that most globular-cluster post-AGB stars have luminosities \mathrm{log}(L/{L}_{\odot })\sim 3.25. They are the progeny of blue horizontal-branch (HB) stars in clusters with intermediate metallicity ([Fe/H] ∼ −1.5). A second group consists of sub-luminous stars associated with high-metallicity clusters ([Fe/H] ∼ −1.0) with red HBs. They may be burning helium, rather than hydrogen. A third group of hot, super-luminous stars is evolving quickly across the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. Some of them may be merger remnants.

<title>Multiwavelength Campaign Observations of a Young Solar-type Star, EK Draconis. I. Discovery of Prominence Eruptions Associated with Superflares</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Young solar-type stars frequently produce superflares, serving as a unique window into the young Sun-Earth environments. Large solar flares are closely linked to coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with filament/prominence eruptions, but observational evidence for stellar superflares remains scarce. Here, we present a 12-day, multiwavelength campaign observation of young solar-type star EK Draconis (G1.5V, 50–120 Myr age) utilizing the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, the Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR, and the Seimei telescope. The star has previously exhibited blueshifted Hα absorptions as evidence for a filament eruption associated with a superflare. Our simultaneous optical and X-ray observations identified three superflares of 1.5 × 1033–1.2 × 1034 erg. We report the first discovery of two prominence eruptions on a solar-type star, observed as blueshifted Hα emissions at speeds of 690 and 430 km s−1 and masses of 1.1 × 1019 and 3.2 × 1017 g, respectively. The faster, massive event shows a candidate of post-flare X-ray dimming with the amplitude of up to ∼10%. Several observational aspects consistently point to the occurrence of a fast CME associated with this event. The comparative analysis of the estimated length scales of flare loops, prominences, possible dimming region, and starspots provides the overall picture of the eruptive phenomena. Furthermore, the energy partition of the observed superflares in the optical and X-ray bands is consistent with flares from the Sun, M-dwarfs, and close binaries, yielding the unified empirical relations. These discoveries provide profound implications of the impact of these eruptive events on early Venus, Earth, and Mars and young exoplanets.

<title>Potential Melting of Extrasolar Planets by Tidal Dissipation</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad0b82</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad0b82</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Tidal heating on Io due to its finite eccentricity was predicted to drive surface volcanic activity, which was subsequently confirmed by the Voyager spacecraft. Although the volcanic activity in Io is more complex, in theory volcanism can be driven by runaway melting in which the tidal heating increases as the mantle thickness decreases. We show that this runaway melting mechanism is generic for a composite planetary body with liquid core and solid mantle, provided that (i) the mantle rigidity, μ, is comparable to the central pressure, i.e., μ/(ρgRP) ≳ 0.1 for a body with density ρ, surface gravitational acceleration g, and radius RP; (ii) the surface is not molten; (iii) tides deposit sufficient energy; and (iv) the planet has nonzero eccentricity. We calculate the approximate liquid core radius as a function of μ/(ρgRP), and find that more than 90% of the core will melt due to this runaway for μ/(ρgRP) ≳ 1. From all currently confirmed exoplanets, we find that the terrestrial planets in the L 98-59 system are the most promising candidates for sustaining active volcanism. However, uncertainties regarding the quality factors and the details of tidal heating and cooling mechanisms prohibit definitive claims of volcanism on any of these planets. We generate synthetic transmission spectra of these planets assuming Venus-like atmospheric compositions with an additional 5%, 50%, and 98% SO2 component, which is a tracer of volcanic activity. We find a ≳3σ preference for a model with SO2 with 5–10 transits with JWST for L 98-59bcd.

<title>A Numerical Study of the Effects of a Corotating Interaction Region on Cosmic-Ray Transport. II. Features of Cosmic-Ray Composition and Rigidity</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad0cb6</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad0cb6</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We continue the numerical modeling of a corotating interaction region (CIR) and the effects it has on solar-rotational recurrent variations of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). A magnetohydrodynamic model is adapted to simulate the background solar wind plasma with a CIR structure in the inner heliosphere, which is incorporated into a comprehensive Parker-type transport model. The focus is on the simulation of the effects of a CIR on GCR protons and the two helium isotopes as a function of heliolongitude. This is to establish whether the difference in composition affects how they are modulated by the CIR in terms of their distribution in longitude. It is demonstrated that particle diffusion and drift influence the effects of the CIR with increasing rigidity from 100 MV up to 15 GV. It is found that protons and helium isotopes are modulated differently with longitude by the CIR and that particle drift influences the modulation effects in longitude. These differences dissipate with increasing rigidity. The final results are focused on the simulated amplitude of these GCR flux variations as a function of rigidity. The amplitude displays a power-law behavior above ∼1 GV with an index similar to the power index of the rigidity dependence of the assumed diffusion coefficients. The simulations further show that below this rigidity, the amplitude at first flattens off, displaying a plateau-like profile, but it then increases systematically with decreasing rigidity below ∼0.3 GV. Again, a power-law behavior is displayed, but it is completely different from that above 1 GV.

<title>How Many Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Are Detectable through Tracking Relative Motions by (Sub)millimeter Very Long Baseline Interferometry?</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad0da1</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad0da1</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The (sub)millimeter wavelengths (86–690 GHz) very long baseline interferometry will provide ∼5–40 μas angular resolution, ∼10 mJy baseline sensitivity, and ∼1 μas yr−1 proper-motion precision, which can directly detect supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) systems by imaging the two visible sources and tracking their relative motions. Such a way exhibits an advantage compared to indirect detect methods of observing periodic signals in motion and light curves, which are difficult to confirm from competing models. Moreover, tracking relative motion at (sub)millimeter wavelengths is more reliable, as there is a negligible offset between the emission region and the black hole center. In this way, it is unnecessary to correct the black hole location by a prior of jet morphology as it would be required at longer wavelengths. We extend the formalism developed in D’Orazio &amp; Loeb (2018) to link the observations with the orbital evolution of SMBHBs from the ≲10 kpc dynamical friction stages to the ≲0.01 pc gravitational radiation stages, and estimate the detectable numbers of SMBHBs. By assuming 5% of active galactic nuclei holding SMBHBs, we find that the number of detectable SMBHBs with redshift z ≤ 0.5 and mass M ≤ 1011M⊙ is about 20. Such a detection relies heavily on proper-motion precision and sensitivity. Furthermore, we propose that the simultaneous multifrequency technique plays a key role in meeting the observational requirements.

<title>JWST Confirms the Nature of CID-42</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad0e0d</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The galaxy CID-42 (CXOC J100043.1+020637.2) at z = 0.359 has been proposed to contain a promising candidate for a gravitational-wave recoiling supermassive black hole (SMBH), a slingshot SMBH from a triple-SMBH interaction, or a kiloparsec-scale dual active galactic nucleus (AGN). These claims were primarily based on a pair of bright cores separated by ∼0.″5 resolved in optical Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging. Existing HST, Chandra, and ground-based imaging and spectroscopy are unable to confirm either scenario. With improved spatial resolution, depth, and IR wavelength coverage, NIRCam multiband imaging from the COSMOS-Web JWST treasury program well resolved the two cores in CID-42, revealing a significant stellar bulge for both cores (with stellar masses of ∼1010M⊙ for both). JWST imaging further revealed that only the SE core contains an unobscured AGN point source, based on both image decomposition and spectral energy distribution fitting. There is no evidence for AGN activity in the NW core based on the current data. These new observations unambiguously rule out the gravitational-wave-recoiling and slingshot-SMBH scenarios and establish CID-42 as a low-redshift merging pair of galaxies, with likely only one active AGN in the system. These results demonstrate the unparalleled capabilities of JWST (even with imaging alone) in studying the galactic-scale environment of merging galaxies and SMBHs.

<title>Volume Density Structure of the Central Molecular Zone NGC 253 through ALCHEMI Excitation Analysis</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad0e64</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a spatially resolved excitation analysis for the central molecular zone (CMZ) of the starburst galaxy NGC 253 using the data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Comprehensive High-resolution Extragalactic Molecular Inventory, whereby we explore parameters distinguishing NGC 253 from the quiescent Milky Way’s Galactic center (GC). Non-LTE analyses employing a hierarchical Bayesian framework are applied to Band 3–7 transitions from nine molecular species to delineate the position–position–velocity distributions of column density ({N}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}), volume density ({n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}), and temperature (Tkin) at 27 pc resolution. Two distinct components are detected: a low-density component with ({n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}},{T}_{\mathrm{kin}})\sim ({10}^{3.3}\ {\mathrm{cm}}^{-3},85\ {\rm{K}}) and a high-density component with ({n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}},{T}_{\mathrm{kin}})\,\sim ({10}^{4.4}\ {\mathrm{cm}}^{-3},110\ {\rm{K}}), separated at {n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}\sim {10}^{3.8}\ {\mathrm{cm}}^{-3}. NGC 253 has ∼10 times the high-density gas mass and ∼3 times the dense-gas mass fraction of the GC. These properties are consistent with their HCN/CO ratio but cannot alone explain the factor of ∼30 difference in their star formation efficiencies (SFEs), contradicting the dense-gas mass to star formation rate scaling law. The {n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}} histogram toward NGC 253 exhibits a shallow declining slope up to {n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}\sim {10}^{6}\ {\mathrm{cm}}^{-3}, while that of the GC steeply drops in {n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}\gtrsim {10}^{4.5}\ {\mathrm{cm}}^{-3} and vanishes at 105 cm−3. Their dense-gas mass fraction ratio becomes consistent with their SFEs when the threshold {n}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}} for the dense gas is taken at ∼104.2−4.6 cm−3. The rich abundance of gas above this density range in the NGC 253 CMZ, or its scarcity in the GC, is likely to be the critical difference characterizing the contrasting star formation in the centers of the two galaxies.

<title>Constraints on Coasting Cosmological Models from Gravitational-wave Standard Sirens</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1035</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the first test of coasting cosmological models with gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens observed in the first three observing runs of the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA detector network. We apply the statistical galaxy catalog method adapted to coasting cosmologies and infer constraints on the H0 Hubble constant for the three fixed values of the curvature parameter k=\left\{-1,0,+1\right\} in {H}_{0}^{2}{c}^{-2} units. The maximum posteriors and 68.3% highest density intervals we obtained from a combined analysis of 46 dark siren detections and a single bright siren detection are {H}_{0}=\left\{{68.1}_{-5.6}^{+8.5},{67.5}_{-5.2}^{+8.3},{67.1}_{-5.8}^{+6.6}\right\}\,\mathrm{km}\ {{\rm{s}}}^{-1}\ {\mathrm{Mpc}}^{-1}, respectively. All our constraints on H0 are consistent within 1σ with the H0 measured with the differential age method, which provides a constraint on H0 in coasting cosmologies independently from k. Our results constrain all cosmological models with a(t) ∝ t linear expansion in the luminosity distance and redshift range of the 47 LIGO–Virgo detections, i.e., dL ≲ 5Gpc and z ≲ 0.8, which practically include all (both strictly linear and quasi-linear) models in the coasting model family. As we have found, the coasting models and the Lambda cold dark matter (or ΛCDM) model fit equally well to the applied set of GW detections.

<title>The JWST Resolved Stellar Populations Early Release Science Program. IV. The Star Formation History of the Local Group Galaxy WLM</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1105</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad1105</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the first star formation history (SFH) and age–metallicity relation (AMR) derived from resolved stellar populations imaged with the JWST NIRCam instrument. The target is the Local Group star-forming galaxy WLM at 970 kpc. The depth of the color–magnitude diagram (CMD) reaches below the oldest main sequence turnoff with a signal-to-noise ratio = 10 at MF090W = + 4.6 mag. This is the deepest CMD for any galaxy that is not a satellite of the Milky Way. We use Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical imaging that overlaps with the NIRCam observations to directly evaluate the SFHs derived based on data from the two great observatories. The JWST and HST-based SFHs are in excellent agreement. We use the metallicity distribution function measured from stellar spectra to confirm the trends in the AMRs based on the JWST data. Together, these results confirm the efficacy of recovering an SFH and AMR with the NIRCam F090W−F150W filter combination, and validate the sensitivity and accuracy of stellar evolution libraries in the near-infrared relative to the optical for SFH recovery work. From the JWST data, WLM shows an early onset to star formation, followed by an extended pause post-reionization before star formation reignites, which is qualitatively similar to what has been observed in the isolated galaxies Leo A and Aquarius. Quantitatively, 15% of the stellar mass formed in the first Gyr, while only 10% formed over the next ∼5 Gyr. The stellar mass then rapidly doubled in ∼2.5 Gyr, followed by constant star formation over the last ∼5 Gyr.

<title>Efficiency of Turbulent Reacceleration by Solenoidal Turbulence and Its Application to the Origin of Radio Megahalos in Cluster Outskirts</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad11ce</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent radio observations with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) discovered diffuse emission extending beyond the scale of classical radio halos. The presence of such megahalos indicates that the amplification of the magnetic field and acceleration of relativistic particles are working in the cluster outskirts, presumably due to the combination of shocks and turbulence that dissipate energy in these regions. Cosmological magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of galaxy clusters suggest that solenoidal turbulence has a significant energy budget in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. In this paper, we explore the possibility that this turbulence contributes to the emission observed in megahalos through second-order Fermi acceleration of relativistic particles and magnetic field amplification by the dynamo. We focus on the case of A2255 and find that this scenario can explain the basic properties of the diffuse emission component that is observed under assumptions that are used in previous literature. More specifically, we conduct a numerical follow-up, solving the Fokker–Planck equation by using a snapshot of an MHD simulation and deducing the synchrotron brightness integrated along the lines of sight. We find that a volume-filling emission, ranging between 30% and almost 100% of the projected area, depending on our assumptions on the particle diffusion and transport, can be detected at LOFAR sensitivities. Assuming a magnetic field B ∼ 0.2  μG, as derived from a dynamo model applied to the emitting region, we find that the observed brightness can be matched when ∼1% of the solenoidal turbulent energy flux is channeled into particle acceleration.

总结:<br /><br />这项研究首次对银河螺旋臂中的磁场结构进行了层析成像，利用光学恒星偏振测量探测了射手座螺旋臂，结合Gaia任务提供的恒星距离数据，成功分离并分析了沿视线方向上五个不同云团的磁场贡献。观测到的云团包括一个前景云（d < 200 pc）和四个射手座臂上的云团。这些云团的柱密度范围从0.5到2.8×1021 cm−2不等，与每个云团相关的磁场显示出在小于10 pc的区域内平滑的空间分布，并显示出不同的取向。测量的位置角从银河北向东测量，依次是135°、46°、58°、150°和40°，这些位置角与银河平面平行方向有明显偏差。 <div>
The Galactic global magnetic field is thought to play a vital role in shaping Galactic structures such as spiral arms and giant molecular clouds. However, our knowledge of magnetic field structures in the Galactic plane at different distances is limited, as measurements used to map the magnetic field are the integrated effect along the line of sight. In this study, we present the first ever tomographic imaging of magnetic field structures in a Galactic spiral arm. Using optical stellar polarimetry over a 17^{\prime} \times 10^{\prime} field of view, we probe the Sagittarius spiral arm. Combining these data with stellar distances from the Gaia mission, we can isolate the contributions of five individual clouds along the line of sight by analyzing the polarimetry data as a function of distance. The observed clouds include a foreground cloud (d &lt; 200 pc) and four clouds in the Sagittarius arm at 1.23, 1.47, 1.63, and 2.23 kpc. The column densities of these clouds range from 0.5 to 2.8 × 1021 cm−2. The magnetic fields associated with each cloud show smooth spatial distributions within their observed regions on scales smaller than 10 pc and display distinct orientations. The position angles projected on the plane of the sky, measured from the Galactic north to the east, for the clouds in increasing order of distance are 135°, 46°, 58°, 150°, and 40°, with uncertainties of a few degrees. Notably, these position angles deviate significantly from the direction parallel to the Galactic plane.

<div> gravitationally lensed DSFGs, high-resolution, star formation, extreme starbursts, PASSAGES collaboration<br />总结:
PASSAGES合作团队最近定义了30个通过引力透镜效应被观测到的尘埃星系形成星系(DSFGs)。这些罕见的亚毫米波选取的对象使得我们能够以高分辨率观测宇宙中午时最极端的星系中的星形成地点。利用lenstool分析了这些DSFGs中的15个物体，其跨越了z = 1.1–3.3的范围，使用了0.″6分辨率1.1mm阿塔卡马大毫米/亚毫米阵列(Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array)和0.″4 5cm望远镜(Jansky Very Large Array)连续成像的补充信息，以及与1.6μm哈勃和用Gemini-S进行的光学成像。物体放大倍数范围从μ = 2到28(平均μ = 7)，对应的红外光度范围为LIR = 0.2–5.9 × 10^13L⊙ (平均1.4 × 10^13L⊙)以及推断的星形成速率为170–6300 M⊙ yr−1 (平均1500 M⊙ yr−1)。这些结果表明PASSAGES物体包含了一些已知最极端的星爆，甚至与未经透镜的物体的亮度相媲美，还受到引力透镜效应的放大。远红外连续区域的固有大小较大(Re = 1.7–4.3 kpc; 平均3.0 kpc)，但与z > 1 DSFGs的LIR–Re比例关系一致，这表明了普遍的星形成空间分布。而研究也发现这些物体可能不是最大化的星爆，至少在全局的、整合的星系尺度上，它们的辐射压力限制安全地低于艾丁顿限制。 <div>
The PASSAGES (Planck All-Sky Survey to Analyze Gravitationally-lensed Extreme Starbursts) collaboration has recently defined a sample of 30 gravitationally lensed dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). These rare, submillimeter-selected objects enable high-resolution views of the most extreme sites of star formation in galaxies at cosmic noon. Here, we present the first major compilation of strong lensing analyses using lenstool for PASSAGES, including 15 objects spanning z = 1.1–3.3, using complementary information from 0.″6-resolution 1.1 mm Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and 0.″4 5 cm Jansky Very Large Array continuum imaging, in tandem with 1.6 μm Hubble and optical imaging with Gemini-S. Magnifications range from μ = 2 to 28 (median μ = 7), yielding intrinsic infrared luminosities of LIR = 0.2–5.9 × 1013L⊙ (median 1.4 × 1013L⊙) and inferred star formation rates of 170–6300 M⊙ yr−1 (median 1500 M⊙ yr−1). These results suggest that the PASSAGES objects comprise some of the most extreme known starbursts, rivaling the luminosities of even the brightest unlensed objects, further amplified by lensing. The intrinsic sizes of far-infrared continuum regions are large (Re = 1.7–4.3 kpc; median 3.0 kpc) but consistent with LIR–Re scaling relations for z &gt; 1 DSFGs, suggesting a widespread spatial distribution of star formation. With modestly high angular resolution, we explore if these objects might be maximal starbursts. Instead of approaching Eddington-limited surface densities, above which radiation pressure will disrupt further star formation, they are safely sub-Eddington—at least on global, galaxy-integrated scales.

<div> 磁通量绳索，帕克太阳探测器，磁场模型，等离子体β值，再连接<br />
总结:<br />
本研究报告了帕克太阳探测器（PSP）在三次接触时在窄的Carrington经度范围内观察到的小尺度磁通量绳索（SMFRs）的情况。研究发现在1.°4经度范围内连续观察到了一系列的SMFRs，这些SMFRs在径向距离上持续了约8.4个太阳半径单位（R☉）。这些SMFRs明显区别于周围环境，其等离子体β值显著降低，磁场和等离子体流动波动显著减少。此外，在Encounters 1和5中也发现了类似的SMFRs。研究推测这些SMFRs可能是在太阳附近的极窄角区域内通过连续再连接而重复生成的。 <div>
In this study, we report on small-scale magnetic flux ropes (SMFRs) observed as a compact series in a narrow Carrington longitudinal range during three Parker Solar Probe (PSP) encounters. First, during ∼1.5 days of PSP's inbound part of Encounter 4, we identified a series of 11 SMFRs within 1.°4 in longitude over the radial distance of ∼8.4 R☉ (from ∼44 to 35 R☉). The identified SMFRs lasted from ∼0.5 to 1.8 hr, and adjacent events were separated mostly by a few hours and up to ∼6.5 hr at the longest, but some events were very closely spaced with intervals of a few ∼tens of minutes or less apart. Most of the identified SMFRs are successfully fitted to the force-free model. The SMFRs are clearly distinguished from the surroundings by a notable reduction in plasma β, which itself was comparably low (less than unity) in the background plasma. Furthermore, the magnetic field and plasma flow within the SMFRs fluctuated significantly less than the more turbulent surroundings. The fluctuations in the surrounding medium exhibited occasional Br polarity reversal (possibly switchbacks) and were Alfvénic to a large extent with far weaker compressional components. The majority of these key features with some differences have also been found in the series of SMFRs and their surroundings identified within 1.°3 or less in longitude during Encounters 1 and 5. We speculate that these SMFRs were repetitively generated by successive reconnection within a very narrow angular zone located close to the Sun but not necessarily at the same radial position.

这篇文章使用500和700 au分辨率的观测数据，对Sagittarius B2（Sgr B2）北部（N）和主要（M）的原恒星核进行了观测。他们发现这些原恒星核中有约三分之一会分裂成平均两个物体。观测显示大多数源都部分受到光学厚的影响，它们与0/I级原恒星对象最一致，比太阳附近观测到的物体更温暖。此外，根据源计数推算了星体质量和星体形成速率。Sgr B2 N的星体质量为2800 M⊙，星体形成速率为0.0038 M⊙ yr−1；Sgr B2 M的星体质量为6900 M⊙，星体形成速率为0.0093 M⊙ yr−1。
<br /><br />总结: Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array的高分辨率观测显示Sgr B2北部和主要的原恒星核会发生分裂，大多数源都部分受到光学厚的影响，符合0/I级原恒星对象的特征，而且更温暖。根据源计数推算了星体质量和星体形成速率，Sgr B2的星体质量为2800 M⊙，Sgr B2 M的星体质量为6900 M⊙。 <div>
We present 500 and 700 au resolution 1 and 3 mm Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations, respectively, of protostellar cores in protoclusters Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2) North (N) and Main (M), parts of the most actively star-forming cloud in our Galaxy. Previous lower-resolution (5000 au) 3 mm observations of this region detected ∼150 sources inferred to be young stellar objects (YSOs) with M &gt; 8 M⊙. With a 10-fold increase in resolution, we detect 371 sources at 3 mm and 218 sources in the smaller field of view at 1 mm. The sources seen at low resolution are observed to fragment into an average of two objects. About one-third of the observed sources fragment. Most of the sources we report are marginally resolved and are at least partially optically thick. We determine that the observed sources are most consistent with Stage 0/I YSOs, i.e., rotationally supported disks with an active protostar and an envelope, that are warmer than those observed in the solar neighborhood. We report source-counting-based inferred stellar mass and the star formation rate of the cloud: 2800 M⊙ and 0.0038 M⊙ yr−1 for Sgr B2 N and 6900 M⊙ and 0.0093 M⊙ yr−1 for Sgr B2 M, respectively.

总结:<br /><br />本文研究了使用f(R)引力理论框架计算原始黑洞合并率的问题，并发现与广义相对论相比，原始黑洞的合并率会有所增加。此外，通过调节场强fR0可以引起原始黑洞合并率的变化，这可能是修改引力的潜在观测特征。文章还探讨了来自f(R)引力模型的原始黑洞丰度的上限，并将结果与引力波和观测数据进行了比较。研究结果表明，在某些未被基准数据排除的区域，这些上限的参数空间可能是可靠的。 <div>
Primordial black holes (PBHs) are known as one of the potential candidates for dark matter. They are expected to have formed due to the direct gravitational collapse of density fluctuations in the early Universe. In this regard, examining the merger rate of PBHs within modified theories of gravity can offer a deeper insight into their abundance. In this work, we delve into the calculation of the merger rate of PBHs within the theoretical framework of f(R) gravity. Our analysis reveals an enhancement in the merger rate of PBHs compared to that obtained from general relativity. Additionally, modulating the field strength fR0 induces shifts in the PBH merger rate, presenting a potential observational signature of modified gravity. We also explore the upper bounds on the abundance of PBHs obtained from f(R) gravity models by comparing the results with gravitational-wave and observational data. The results indicate that in certain regions not excluded by benchmarking data, the parameter space for these upper bounds may be considered reliable.

总结:
本文研究了在多个尺度上对星系磁场动力学的建模，发现单独建模小尺度磁流体动力学（SSD）或大尺度磁流体动力学（LSD）都无法完全描述银河磁场的动态和拓扑结构。研究表明，SSD对LSD的存在并不敏感，并且在大尺度剪切流存在时更强。此外，我们还发现，通过在OB联合中集中超新星爆发可以增加SSD和LSD的生长速率。最后，我们的研究表明，对于LSD的建模在银河系中的温暖气体中心平面生长，并且通过增加分辨率，我们逐渐接近物理解。 <br /><br /> <div>
Magnetic fields are now widely recognized as critical at many scales to galactic dynamics and structure, including multiphase pressure balance, dust processing, and star formation. Using imposed magnetic fields cannot reliably model the interstellar medium's (ISM) dynamical structure nor phase interactions. Dynamos must be modeled. ISM models exist of turbulent magnetic fields using small-scale dynamo (SSD). Others model the large-scale dynamo (LSD) organizing magnetic fields at the scale of the disk or spiral arms. Separately, neither can fully describe the galactic magnetic field dynamics nor topology. We model the LSD and SSD together at a sufficient resolution to use the low explicit Lagrangian resistivity required. The galactic SSD saturates within 20 Myr. We show that the SSD is quite insensitive to the presence of an LSD and is even stronger in the presence of a large-scale shear flow. The LSD grows more slowly in the presence of SSD, saturating after 5 Gyr versus 1–2 Gyr in studies where the SSD is weak or absent. The LSD primarily grows in warm gas in the galactic midplane. Saturation of the LSD occurs due to α-quenching near the midplane as the growing mean-field produces a magnetic α that opposes the kinetic α. The magnetic energy in our models of the LSD shows a slightly sublinear response to increasing resolution, indicating that we are converging toward the physical solution at 1 pc resolution. Clustering supernovae in OB associations increases the growth rates for both the SSD and the LSD, compared to a horizontally uniform supernova distribution.

<br />总结: <br />这篇文章讨论了活动星系核的变化特性，并提出了一个新的优化解决方案，通过仔细审查假设的先验知识、采用的最佳拟合值、集合平均方法和拟合方法的复杂组合，确定了获取无偏差变化特性的最佳监测基线。这一结果对广域巡天望远镜进行的时间域调查具有积极作用，可以改善对AGN变化特性的约束。 <div>
The variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is ubiquitous, but has not yet been understood. Measuring the optical variation properties of AGNs, such as the variation timescale and amplitude, and then correlating them with their fundamental physical parameters has long served as a critical way of exploring the origin of AGN variability and the associated physics of the accretion process in AGNs. Obtaining accurate variation properties of AGNs is thus essential. It has been found that the damped random walk process can describe the AGN optical variation well, but there is a controversy over how long a minimal monitoring baseline is required to obtain unbiased variation properties. In this work, we settle the controversy by exhaustively scrutinizing the complex combination of assumed priors, adopted best-fit values, ensemble averaging methods, and fitting methods. The new proposal is then an optimized solution where unbiased variation properties of an AGN sample possessing the same variation timescale can be obtained with a minimal baseline of about 10 times their variation timescale. Finally, the new optimized solution is used to demonstrate the positive role of the time-domain surveys to be conducted by the Wide Field Survey Telescope in improving constraints on AGN variation properties.

总结:
本文研究了类地无生命行星大气中CO2、CO和CH4的相对丰度对行星气候和生物地球化学的基本控制。研究结果表明，大气中CO2水平的升高会触发CO气体的光化学失稳，导致CO逃逸。同时，更高的火山岩浆喷发通量也会引发CO逃逸。我们的系统研究揭示了类似地球的无生命行星的缺氧大气可以根据CH4/CO2与CO/CO2的相对比值被归类。研究结果表明，这种缺口结构是围绕类太阳恒星（F型、G型和K型）运转的类地无生命行星大气的普遍特征。 <div>
Carbon is an essential element for life on Earth, and the relative abundances of major carbon species (CO2, CO, and CH4) in the atmosphere exert fundamental controls on planetary climate and biogeochemistry. Here we employed a theoretical model of atmospheric chemistry to investigate diversity in the atmospheric abundances of CO2, CO, and CH4 on Earth-like lifeless planets orbiting Sun-like (F-, G-, and K-type) stars. We focused on the conditions for the formation of a CO-rich atmosphere, which would be favorable for the origin of life. Results demonstrated that elevated atmospheric CO2 levels trigger photochemical instability of the CO budget in the atmosphere (i.e., CO runaway) owing to enhanced CO2 photolysis relative to H2O photolysis. Higher volcanic outgassing fluxes of reduced C (CO and CH4) also tend to initiate CO runaway. Our systematic examinations revealed that anoxic atmospheres of Earth-like lifeless planets could be classified in the phase space of CH4/CO2 versus CO/CO2, where a distinct gap in atmospheric carbon chemistry is expected to be observed. Our findings indicate that the gap structure is a general feature of Earth-like lifeless planets with reducing atmospheres orbiting Sun-like (F-, G-, and K-type) stars.

The transport of energetic charged particles through magnetized plasmas is ubiquitous in interplanetary space and astrophysics, and the important physical quantities are the parallel and perpendicular diffusion coefficients of energetic charged particles. In this paper, the influence of solar wind on particle transport is investigated. Using the focusing equation, we obtain parallel and perpendicular diffusion coefficients, accounting for the solar wind effect. For different conditions, the relative importance of the solar wind effect to diffusion is investigated. It is shown that, when energetic charged particles are close to the Sun, for parallel diffusion, the solar wind effect needs to be taken into account. These results are important for studying energetic charged particle transport processes in the vicinity of the Sun.

The electromagnetic emission from the nonrelativistic ejecta launched in neutron star mergers (either dynamically or through a disk wind) has the potential to probe both the total mass and composition of this ejecta. These observations are crucial in understanding the role of these mergers in the production of r-process elements in the Universe. However, many properties of the ejecta can alter the light curves and we must both identify which properties play a role in shaping this emission and understand the effects these properties have on the emission before we can use observations to place strong constraints on the amount of r-process elements produced in the merger. This paper focuses on understanding the effect of the velocity distribution (amount of mass moving at different velocities) for lanthanide-rich ejecta on the light curves and spectra. The simulations use distributions guided by recent calculations of disk outflows and compare the velocity-distribution effects to those of ejecta mass, velocity, and composition. Our comparisons show that uncertainties in the velocity distribution can lead to a factor of 2–4 uncertainties in the inferred ejecta mass based on peak infrared luminosities. We also show that early-time UV or optical observations may be able to constrain the velocity distribution, reducing the uncertainty in the ejecta mass.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了加拿大氢强度映射实验(CHIME)干涉仪近年来发现的大量快速无线电暴( FRB) ，包括一大部分表现出重复行为的FRB。文章使用蒙特卡洛模拟对重复FRB进行了模拟，并通过不同的宇宙分布构建了FRB样本模型。研究还推断了CHIME/FRB观测的完整性，并预测了未来设施对FRB重复爆发的发现。根据模拟结果，作者预测当前的CHIME/FRB观测会有大约170个重复爆发来源，同时也展示了未来设施在大约3年时间内发现的重复爆发数量可能会达到饱和。 <div>
In recent years, the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) interferometer has revealed a large number of fast radio bursts (FRBs), including a sizable population that demonstrates repeating behavior. This transit facility, employing a real-time FRB search pipeline, continually scans the sky with declinations between −10° and 90° for events with fluences ⪆0.4 Jy ms. We simulate a population of repeating FRBs by performing Monte Carlo simulations of underlying source populations processed through a mock CHIME/FRB observing pipeline. Assuming intrinsic repeater rates follow a Poisson distribution, we test assumptions about the burst populations of the repeater sample, and construct models of the FRB sample assuming various cosmological distributions. We infer the completeness of CHIME/FRB observations as a function of observing cadence and redshifts out to 0.5. We find that, if all simulated bursts have a fixed Poisson probability of repetition over their integrated time of observation, repeating burst detections across comoving volume should continue to grow near linearly on the order of decades. We predict that around 170 of the current CHIME/FRB one-off sources will ultimately repeat. We also make projections for FRB repeaters by future facilities and demonstrate that the number of repeaters they find could saturate on a ∼3 yr timescale.

这篇文章研究了2012年3月10日观察到的一次复合太阳耀斑的磁场配置。研究者构建了一系列磁场模型，利用磁力线插入方法，实现了双层磁流结构的三维日冕磁场模型。他们发现，在初始磁力摩擦松弛过程中，共享相同路径但高度不同的双层磁流很快出现部分合并。但是，路径之间少于30%的重叠可以构建稳定的双层结构。通过对已验证的非线性力自由场双层配置中磁通量的变化，成功复现了双层结构的三种喷发情况。这表明磁力摩擦模拟可以捕捉到喷发开始时的大尺度磁场结构。 <div>
We present a magnetic configuration of a compound solar eruption observed on 2012 March 10, from NOAA AR 11429 near the disk center, which displayed a soft X-ray sigmoid before the eruption. We constructed a series of magnetic field models, including double-decker flux rope configurations, using the flux rope insertion method. This produces three-dimensional coronal magnetic field models constrained by the photospheric magnetogram and observed EUV coronal structures. We used different combinations of flux rope paths. We found that two flux ropes sharing the same path at different heights quickly experience a partial merging in the initial iteration of the magnetofrictional relaxation process. Different paths with less than 30% overlap allowed us to construct stable double-decker structures. The high spatial and temporal resolution of the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly facilitated the selection of a best-fit model that matches the observations best. Moreover, by varying fluxes in this validated nonlinear force-free field double-decker configuration, we successfully reproduce all three scenarios of eruptions of double-decker configurations: (i) eruption due to the instability of higher flux rope; (ii) eruption due to rising lower flux rope and merging with higher flux rope; and (iii) eruption due to the instability of both flux ropes. This demonstrates that magnetofrictional simulation can capture the large-scale magnetic structure of eruptions for a realistic field configuration at eruption onset.

<div> 关键词: R Aqr, 光谱演化, 空间演化, X射线, 联星系统
总结:
R Aqr是一个由红巨星和白矮星组成的联星系统，经过Chandra的观测发现其X射线辐射经历了显著变化。软X射线的发射量在感知到的射流辐射后有所上升，随后回落至之前的平静状态。硬X射线的辐射量在2017至2021年间保持不变，但在2022年后迅速下降。这可能是由于介质反射特性的改变、在近心点通道期间喷发物质的遮挡或白矮星周围吸积盘内部区域的部分/完全破坏。此外，还检测到了扩展辐射，可能与事先喷发的射流中的热斑有关，并且可以观察到其远离系统的中心区域。<br /><br /> <div>
We report on the X-ray spectral and spatial evolution of the symbiotic star R Aqr. Through a multiepoch observational campaign performed with Chandra between 2017 and 2022, we study the X-ray emission of this binary system, composed of an evolved red giant star and a white dwarf (WD). This analysis is particularly timely as the WD approached the periastron in late 2018/early 2019; thus, mass transfer, jet emission, and outburst phenomena are to be expected. Through detailed spectral analysis, we detect a significant rise in the soft X-ray (0.5–2 keV) emission of R Aqr, likely linked to jet emission, followed by a decay toward the previous quiescent state. The hard X-ray emission (5–8 keV) is not immediately affected by the periastron passage; the hard component, after maintaining the same flux level between 2017 and 2021, rapidly decays after 2022. Possible explanations for this are a change in the reflection properties of the medium surrounding the binary, obscuration of the central region by material ejected during the periastron passage, or even the partial/complete destruction of the inner regions of the accretion disk surrounding the WD. In addition to this activity in the central region, extended emission is also detected, likely linked to a hot spot in a pre-outburst-emitted jet, which can be observed moving away from the system’s central region.

这篇文章提出了一种新的方法来测量银河系的垂直势能。他们利用相空间蜗牛与z/Vz轴的交点，通过线性插值方法直接得出垂直势能的约束。他们的方法是独立于模型的，因为对蜗牛形状或垂直势能没有假设。研究表明，在银河系中，相空间蜗牛按照指导中心半径进行分组更为显著，但跟踪的垂直势能比相同银心半径分组的要浅。他们还应用了经验方法来校正这种差异。通过Gaia DR3数据，他们测量了几个Rg分组内的蜗牛交点，并应用插值法在几个垂直高度上推断势能值。研究结果显示，蜗牛交点处的势能以及接下来的质量建模与文献中的银河系势能模型是一致的。另外，他们的方法还可以在未来的研究中应用于更大的径向范围，提供对银河系势能的独立和更强的约束。<br /><br />总结: 本文提出了一种通过相空间蜗牛来测量银河系垂直势能的新方法，该方法独立于模型，能够有效约束银河系的势能，为我们更好地理解银河系的动力学提供了新途径。 <div>
The vertical phase-space spiral (snail) is a direct sign of disequilibrium of the Milky Way’s disk. Nevertheless, the wrapping of the phase snail contains information on the vertical potential. We propose a novel method to measure the vertical potential utilizing the intersections between the snail and z/Vz axes, for which we know the maximum vertical heights (Zmax) or velocities ({V}_{z,\max }). Using a refined linear interpolation method, we directly obtain ({Z}_{\max },\tfrac{1}{2}{V}_{z,\max }^{2}) for these snail intersections to constrain the vertical potential profile empirically. Our method is model-independent, since no assumptions about the snail shape or the vertical potential have been made. Although the snail binned by the guiding center radius (Rg) is more prominent, it traces a vertical potential shallower than that of the snail binned by the same galactocentric radius (R). We apply an empirical method to correct this difference. We measure the snail intersections in several Rg bins within 7.5 &lt; Rg &lt; 11.0 kpc for Gaia DR3 and apply the interpolation method to deduce the potential values at several vertical heights. The potential at the snail intersections, as well as the following mass modeling, is consistent with the popular Milky Way potentials in the literature. For the Rg-binned phase snail in the solar neighborhood, the mass modeling indicates a local dark matter density of ρdm = 0.0150 ± 0.0031 M⊙ pc−3, consistent with previous works. Our method could be applied to larger radial ranges in future works to provide independent and stronger constraints on the Milky Way’s potential.

<div> 关键词: 新方法, 星系原型团, 结构形成理论, 质量标准, 模拟校准
<br />
总结: 
本研究提出了一种新的方法，旨在利用结构形成理论直接应用于观测中，以找到星系原型团。该研究采用了传统的定义，即星系原型团是一个在其时代具有 virial 质量 Mvir < Mcl，且在演化至 z = 0 时将超过该限制的星系团。研究利用了在 z = 0 时预测的完全坍缩的临界过密度来找到将在 z = 0 坍缩的区域的半径和总质量。研究利用了宇宙学流体模拟 Horizon Run 5 (HR5) 来校准此方法，并展示了其性能。研究发现，根据球状坍缩模型确定的星系原型团区域内的质量与在 z = 0 发现的星系团内的最终质量之间存在着紧密的相关性。同时，研究也证实了红移空间畸变对星系原型团识别方案的性能影响不大。 <div>
We propose a new method for finding galaxy protoclusters that is motivated by structure formation theory and also directly applicable to observations. We adopt the conventional definition that a protocluster is a galaxy group whose virial mass Mvir &lt; Mcl at its epoch, where Mcl = 1014M⊙, but would exceed that limit when it evolves to z = 0. We use the critical overdensity for complete collapse at z = 0 predicted by the spherical top-hat collapse model to find the radius and total mass of the regions that would collapse at z = 0. If the mass of a region centered at a massive galaxy exceeds Mcl, the galaxy is at the center of a protocluster. We define the outer boundary of a protocluster as the zero-velocity surface at the turnaround radius so that the member galaxies are those sharing the same protocluster environment and showing some conformity in physical properties. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Horizon Run 5 (HR5) to calibrate this prescription and demonstrate its performance. We find that the protocluster identification method suggested in this study is quite successful. Its application to the high-redshift HR5 galaxies shows a tight correlation between the mass within the protocluster regions identified according to the spherical collapse model and the final mass to be found within the clusters at z = 0, meaning that the regions can be regarded as the bona fide protoclusters with high reliability. We also confirm that the redshift-space distortion does not significantly affect the performance of the protocluster identification scheme.

总结:<br />
本文介绍了用于解决散射和吸收媒介中辐射传递方程的快速、可靠且准确的近似方法。作者扩展了球谐方法的推导，用于研究热发射光谱学。通过比较不同模型产生的光谱，证明了SH4方法相对于Toon89方法在准确度上有显著提高。他们还探讨了计算时间和模型准确度之间的权衡，发现SH4方法在准确性方面有显著改进，而数值开销基本没有牺牲。 <div>
Approximate methods for radiative transfer equations that are fast, reliable, and accurate are essential for the understanding of atmospheres of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. The simplest and most popular choice is the “two-stream method,” which is often used to produce simple yet effective models for radiative transfer in scattering and absorbing media. Toon et al. (hereafter, Toon89) outlined a two-stream method for computing reflected light and thermal spectra that was later implemented in the open-source radiative transfer model PICASO. In Part I of this series, we developed an analytical spherical harmonics method for solving the radiative transfer equation for reflected solar radiation that was implemented in PICASO to increase the accuracy of the code by offering a higher-order approximation. This work is an extension of this spherical harmonics derivation, to study thermal emission spectroscopy. We highlight the model differences in the approach for thermal emission and benchmark the four-term method (SH4) against Toon89 and a high-stream discrete-ordinates method, CDISORT. By comparing the spectra produced by each model, we demonstrate that the SH4 method provides a significant increase in accuracy, compared to Toon89, which can be attributed to the increased order of approximation and to the choice of phase function. We also explore the trade-off between computational time and model accuracy. We find that our four-term method is twice as slow as our two-term method, but is up to five times more accurate, when compared with CDISORT. Therefore, SH4 provides excellent improvement in model accuracy with minimal sacrifice in numerical expense.

<div> 关键词: Voyager 1, Voyager 2, magnetic field, heliopause, interstellar medium  
总结:<br />本文重新审视了太空探测器Voyager 1和2在太阳圈层附近和极其局部的星际介质中的数据，旨在更好地理解在通过边界时观察到的磁场旋转的缺乏。然后提出可能的假设，即Voyagers穿越了一个与太阳风层表面沿边界重连接的厚厚的边界层。Voyager 1可能尚未完全穿越这一边界层，而Voyager 2可能已经穿越了这一边界层进入了从未与太阳连接的磁场和等离子体区域，即非常局部的星际介质。<br /> <div>
Voyager 1 and 2 data from the vicinity of the heliopause and very local interstellar medium are reexamined to better understand the confounding lack of rotation in the magnetic field (B-field) across the heliopause observed by both Voyagers, despite their very large spatial separations (&gt;100 au). Using three estimates for the orientation of the B-field in the pristine interstellar medium and four models of the heliosphere, we calculate draped interstellar B-field orientations along the model heliopauses and compare those estimates to the Voyager observations. At both Voyagers, expected draped B-fields are inconsistent with the observed B-field orientations after the boundary crossings. Furthermore, we show how the longer-term trends of the observed B-fields at both Voyagers after the crossings actually rotated away from both the expected draped B-field and the pristine interstellar B-field directions. We develop evidence, including an illustrative and analogous set of observations from Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft along Earth’s magnetopause, in support of a hypothesis that both Voyagers transited a thick boundary layer of reconnected magnetic flux along the heliopause surface. We estimate that Voyager 1 has not yet fully transited this boundary layer, the radial thickness of which at the Voyager 1 crossing location may be &gt;18 au and likely much thicker. Meanwhile, at Voyager 2's crossing location, the boundary layer is likely much thinner, and for Voyager 2, we present evidence that Voyager 2 might already have transited the boundary layer and entered a region of fields and plasma that were never connected to the Sun—the very local interstellar medium.

总结: 
本文利用Daniel K. Inouye太阳望远镜的公开数据，追踪了来自太阳光球到日冕的磁连接。研究了色球磁场与明亮的色球、过渡区和日冕等离子体之间的关系。通过Visible Spectro-Polarimeter仪器获取了磁场测量数据，对未来光环区的等离子体加热状况进行了研究，并发现了一些不同寻常的现象。研究发现，未来光环区中只有一小部分充满了加热等离子体，并没有发现色球磁场特性与加热等离子体之间的相关性。这表明，加热过程受到我们观测不到的控制。总体而言，这些数据表明“日冕是一个自我调节的强迫系统”，而加热取决于日冕的状态，而不仅仅是边界条件。与可识别的双极磁场相关的加热模型在这些具有单极色球磁场的区域中被证伪。 <br /><br /> <div>
We use the first publicly available data from the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope to track magnetic connections from the solar photosphere into the corona. We scrutinize relationships between chromospheric magnetism and bright chromospheric, transition region, and coronal plasmas. In 2022 June, the Visible Spectro-Polarimeter (ViSP) instrument targeted unipolar network within a decaying active region. ViSP acquired rastered scans with longitudinal Zeeman sensitivities of 0.25 Mx cm−2 (Fe i, 630.2 nm) and 0.5 Mx cm−2 (Ca ii, 854.2 nm). ViSP was operated in a “low” resolution mode (0.″214 slit width, spectral resolution { \mathcal R }\approx {\rm{70,000}}) to produce polarization maps over a common area of 105″ × 50″. Data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph are combined to ask: Why is only a fraction of emerging flux filled with heated plasma? What is the elemental nature of the plasmas? No correlations were found between heated plasma and the properties of chromospheric magnetic fields derived from the weak field approximation, on scales below supergranules. Processes hidden from our observations control plasma heating. While improved magnetic measurements are needed, these data indicate that “the corona is a self-regulating forced system.” Heating depends on the state of the corona, not simply on boundary conditions. Heating models based upon identifiable bipolar fields, including cool loops, tectonics, and observable magnetic reconnection, are refuted for these regions with unipolar chromospheric magnetic fields.

<div> 关键词: 快速射电暴 (FRB), 频率相关强度, Kalman检测器, 光谱形状信息, 提高灵敏度

总结:
本文介绍了使用Kalman检测器来改善快速射电暴（FRB）信号检测的灵敏度。Kalman检测器结合了光谱形状信息，基于最优匹配滤波器，并考虑一定的相关带宽，能够提供可比较且独立的FRB探测信息。通过对先前检测到的FRB进行分析，发现Kalman分数的灵敏度提高了20%左右，甚至最高可提高200%。此外，作者还将Kalman检测器应用于FRB 20201124A的数据，并成功检测到之前被忽略的两次重复爆发。最后，作者建议在实时调查中采用从初始流量集成的低显著性软触发的实际实现方法。Kalman检测器有可能显著提高FRB的探测能力，并为了解这些神秘的天体现象的光谱特性提供新的见解。 <div>
Detecting fast radio bursts (FRBs) with frequency-dependent intensity remains a challenge, as existing search algorithms do not account for the spectral shape, potentially leading to nondetections. We propose a novel detection statistic, which we call the Kalman detector, that improves the sensitivity of FRB signal detection by incorporating spectral shape information. The detection statistic is based on an optimal matched filter, marginalizing over all possible intensity functions, weighted by a random walk probability distribution, considering some decorrelation bandwidth. Our analysis of previously detected FRBs demonstrates that the Kalman score provides a comparable yet independent source of information for bursts with significant spectral structure, and the sensitivity improvement is of the order 0%–200% with a median improvement of 20%. We also applied the Kalman detector to existing data from FRB 20201124A and detected two new repeat bursts that were previously missed. Furthermore, we suggest a practical implementation for real-time surveys by employing a low significance soft-trigger from initial flux integration-based detection algorithms. The Kalman detector has the potential to significantly enhance FRB detection capabilities and enable new insights into the spectral properties of these enigmatic astrophysical phenomena.

在这篇研究中，我们对孤立的大质量原恒星G28.20-0.05进行了天体化学诊断研究。我们分析了来自Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array的1.3毫米观测数据，分辨率为0.″2（约1000天文单位）。我们检测到了丰富的物种排放，包括含氧（例如H2CO、CH3OH、CH3OCH3）、含硫（SO2、H2S）和含氮（例如HNCO、NH2CHO、C2H3CN、C2H5CN）的分子。我们讨论了它们的空间分布、物理条件、不同物种之间的相关性以及可能的化学起源。在靠近原恒星的中心区域，我们确定了三个热分子核（HMCs）。HMC1是一个类似环状结构的毫米连续体的一部分，投影到原恒星最近，温度最高约为300K，并且显示出最丰富的谱线。HMC2位于环的另一侧，温度约为250K，并且具有中等的化学复杂性。HMC3则更远一些，投影到大约3000天文单位处，温度较低（约70K），谱线最不丰富。这三个HMC的质量面密度（约10 g cm-2）、数密度（nH约109 cm-3）和质量均为几个太阳质量。核心和3000天文单位范围内的气体总质量约为25太阳质量，与中心原恒星的质量相当。根据激发能量的峰值线强度的空间分布，我们推断HMCs受到原恒星的外部加热。我们估算了检测到的物种的柱密度和丰度，并讨论了对热核天体化学的影响。

We study the astrochemical diagnostics of the isolated massive protostar G28.20-0.05. We analyze data from Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array 1.3 mm observations with a resolution of 0.″2 (∼1000 au). We detect emission from a wealth of species, including oxygen-bearing (e.g., H2CO, CH3OH, CH3OCH3), sulfur-bearing (SO2, H2S), and nitrogen-bearing (e.g., HNCO, NH2CHO, C2H3CN, C2H5CN) molecules. We discuss their spatial distributions, physical conditions, correlation between different species, and possible chemical origins. In the central region near the protostar, we identify three hot molecular cores (HMCs). HMC1 is part of a millimeter continuum ring-like structure, is closest in projection to the protostar, has the highest temperature of ∼300 K, and shows the most line-rich spectra. HMC2 is on the other side of the ring, has a temperature of ∼250 K, and is of intermediate chemical complexity. HMC3 is further away, ∼3000 au in projection, cooler (∼70 K), and is the least line-rich. The three HMCs have similar mass surface densities (∼10 g cm−2), number densities (nH ∼ 109 cm−3), and masses of a few solar masses. The total gas mass in the cores and in the region out to 3000 au is ∼25 M⊙, which is comparable to that of the central protostar. Based on spatial distributions of peak line intensities as a function of excitation energy, we infer that the HMCs are externally heated by the protostar. We estimate column densities and abundances of the detected species and discuss the implications for hot core astrochemistry.

Quasar-driven galactic outflows are a major driver of the evolution of massive galaxies. We report observations of a powerful galactic-scale outflow in a z = 3 extremely red and intrinsically luminous (Lbol ≃ 5 × 1047erg s−1) quasar SDSSJ1652 + 1728 with the Near-infrared Spectrograph on board JWST. We analyze the kinematics of rest-frame optical emission lines and identify the quasar-driven outflow extending out to ∼10 kpc from the quasar with a velocity offset of (vr = ± 500 km s−1) and high velocity dispersion (FWHM = 700–2400 km s−1). Due to JWST’s unprecedented surface brightness sensitivity in the near-infrared, we unambiguously show that the powerful high velocity outflow in an extremely red quasar encompasses a large swath of the host galaxy’s interstellar medium. Using the kinematics and dynamics of optical emission lines, we estimate the mass outflow rate—in the warm ionized phase alone—to be at least 2300 ± 1400 M⊙ yr−1. We measure a momentum flux ratio between the outflow and the quasar accretion disk of ∼1 on a kpc scale, indicating that the outflow was likely driven in a relatively high (&gt;1023cm−2) column density environment through radiation pressure on dust grains. We find a coupling efficiency between the bolometric luminosity of the quasar and the outflow of 0.1%, matching the theoretical prediction of the minimum coupling efficiency necessary for negative quasar feedback. The outflow has sufficient energetics to drive the observed turbulence seen in shocked regions of the quasar host galaxy, which are likely directly responsible for prolonging the time that it takes for gas to cool efficiently.

总结:
RS Ophiuchi是一颗周期性新星，2021年8月8日经历了最新的喷发，同时产生了可检测到的GeV和TeV辐射。通过对其X射线频谱进行广泛监测，使用了Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer Mission（NICER）来模拟X射线光谱，并探测了整个2021年喷发期间的冲击条件。在前5天内，温度显示出了峰值约为24keV的非平衡等离子体。吸收率的变化显示出喷发期间冲击区域的几何演变，最初是与一些密集的赤道壳相互作用，后来与极区的较少密集的物质相互作用。这些发现表明喷发物质与初始时一些密集的赤道壳相互作用，并且在喷发后期与极区的较少密集的物质发生相互作用。 <div>
The recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi (RS Oph) underwent its most recent eruption on 2021 August 8 and became the first nova to produce both detectable GeV and TeV emission. We used extensive X-ray monitoring with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer Mission (NICER) to model the X-ray spectrum and probe the shock conditions throughout the 2021 eruption. The rapidly evolving NICER spectra consisted of both line and continuum emission that could not be accounted for using a single-temperature collisional equilibrium plasma model with an absorber that fully covered the source. We successfully modeled the NICER spectrum as a nonequilibrium ionization collisional plasma with partial covering absorption. The temperature of the nonequilibrium plasma shows a peak on day 5 with a kT of approximately 24 keV. The increase in temperature during the first five days could have been due to increasing contribution to the X-ray emission from material behind fast polar shocks or a decrease is the amount of energy being drained from the shocks into particle acceleration during that period. The absorption showed a change from fully covering the source to having a covering fraction of roughly 0.4, suggesting a geometrical evolution of the shock region within the complex global distribution of the circumstellar material. These findings show evidence of the ejecta interacting with some dense equatorial shell initially, and with less dense material in the bipolar regions at later times during the eruption.

Clusters of galaxies possess the capability to accelerate cosmic rays (CRs) to very high energy up to ∼1018 eV due to their large size and magnetic field strength, which favor CR confinement for cosmological times. During their confinement, they can produce neutrinos and γ-rays out of interactions with the background gas and photon fields. In recent work, Hussain et al. have conducted three-dimensional cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the turbulent intracluster medium combined with multidimensional Monte Carlo simulations of CR propagation for redshifts ranging from z ∼ 5 to z = 0 to study the multimessenger emission from these sources. They found that when CRs with a spectral index in the range 1.5–2.5 and cutoff energy {E}_{\max }={10}^{16}\mbox{--}{10}^{17} eV are injected into the system, they make significant contributions to the diffuse background emission of both neutrinos and γ-rays. In this work, we have revisited this model and undertaken further constraints on the parametric space. This was achieved by incorporating the recently established upper limits on neutrino emission from galaxy clusters, as obtained by the IceCube experiment. We find that for CRs injected with spectral indices in the range 2.0–2.5, cutoff energy {E}_{\max }={10}^{16}\mbox{--}{10}^{17} eV, and power corresponding to (0.1–1)% of the cluster luminosity, our neutrino flux aligns with the upper limits estimated by IceCube. Additionally, the resulting contribution from clusters to the diffuse γ-ray background remains significant with values of the order of ∼10−5 MeV cm−2 s−1 sr−1 at energies above 500 GeV.

Studying the escaping atmospheres of highly irradiated exoplanets is critical for understanding the physical mechanisms that shape the demographics of close-in planets. A number of planetary outflows have been observed as excess H/He absorption during/after transit. Such an outflow has been observed for WASP-69b by multiple groups that disagree on the geometry and velocity structure of the outflow. Here, we report the detection of this planet’s outflow using Keck/NIRSPEC for the first time. We observed the outflow 1.28 hr after egress until the target set, demonstrating the outflow extends at least 5.8 × 105 km or 7.5 Rp This detection is significantly longer than previous observations, which report an outflow extending ∼2.2 planet radii just 1 yr prior. The outflow is blueshifted by −23 km s−1 in the planetary rest frame. We estimate a current mass-loss rate of 1 M⊕ Gyr−1. Our observations are most consistent with an outflow that is strongly sculpted by ram pressure from the stellar wind. However, potential variability in the outflow could be due to time-varying interactions with the stellar wind or differences in instrumental precision.

总结: <br /><br />这篇文章讨论了在未来的LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA观测运行O4中最佳地识别所有通过引力波发射探测到的kilonovae的问题。他们提出了DECam在O4期间的优化观测策略，并基于引力波事件和宽先验kilonova模拟进行了研究。他们优化了策略以确认kilonova，同时最大程度地减少望远镜时间。通过优化策略，他们发现DECam对于银河系引力波探测极限（190Mpc）处的电磁对应物的发现概率约为80％，相比之前的策略提高了约30％。对于更遥远的事件（约330Mpc），发现概率达到约60％，增加了约2倍。对于更亮的kilonova模型，他们发现在330Mpc的范围内可以达到约90％的发现概率，而且还可以减少大约20％的望远镜观测时间。 <div>
We address the problem of optimally identifying all kilonovae detected via gravitational-wave emission in the upcoming LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing run, O4, which is expected to be sensitive to a factor of ∼7 more binary neutron star (BNS) alerts than previously. Electromagnetic follow-up of all but the brightest of these new events will require &gt;1 m telescopes, for which limited time is available. We present an optimized observing strategy for the DECam during O4. We base our study on simulations of gravitational-wave events expected for O4 and wide-prior kilonova simulations. We derive the detectabilities of events for realistic observing conditions. We optimize our strategy for confirming a kilonova while minimizing telescope time. For a wide range of kilonova parameters, corresponding to a fainter kilonova compared to GW170817/AT 2017gfo, we find that, with this optimal strategy, the discovery probability for electromagnetic counterparts with the DECam is ∼80% at the nominal BNS gravitational-wave detection limit for O4 (190 Mpc), which corresponds to an ∼30% improvement compared to the strategy adopted during the previous observing run. For more distant events (∼330 Mpc), we reach an ∼60% probability of detection, a factor of ∼2 increase. For a brighter kilonova model dominated by the blue component that reproduces the observations of GW170817/AT 2017gfo, we find that we can reach ∼90% probability of detection out to 330 Mpc, representing an increase of ∼20%, while also reducing the total telescope time required to follow up events by ∼20%.

Time-dependent photoionization modeling of warm absorber (WA) outflows in active galactic nuclei can play an important role in understanding the interaction between WAs and the central black hole. The WA may be out of the equilibrium state because of the variable nature of the central continuum. In this paper, with the help of time dependent photoionization modeling, we study how the WA gas properties change with time and how it reacts to changing radiation fields. Incorporating a flaring incident light curve, we investigate the behavior of WAs using a photoionization code that simultaneously and consistently solves the time-dependent equations of level population, heating and cooling, and radiative transfer. We simulate the physical processes in the gas clouds, such as ionization, recombination, heating, cooling, and the transfer of ionizing radiation through the cloud and present high-resolution time-resolved absorption spectra. We demonstrate that time-dependent radiative transfer is important and the calculations that omit this effect quantitatively and systematically underestimate the absorption. Time-dependent photoionization models provide crucial insights into the characteristics of WAs and can be used to constrain their density and spatial distribution.

We report spectroscopic observations of vB 120 (HD 30712), a 5.7 yr astrometric–spectroscopic binary system in the Hyades cluster. We combine our radial velocities with others from the literature, and with existing speckle interferometry measurements, to derive an improved 3D orbit for the system. We infer component masses of M1 = 1.065 ± 0.018 M☉ and M2 = 1.008 ± 0.016 M☉, and an orbital parallax of 21.86 ± 0.15 mas, which we show to be more accurate than the parallax from Gaia DR3. This is the ninth binary or multiple system in the Hyades with dynamical mass determinations, and one of the examples with the highest precision. An analysis of its spectral energy distribution yields the absolute radii of the stars, R1 = 0.968 ± 0.012 R☉ and R2 = 0.878 ± 0.013 R☉, and effective temperatures of 5656 ± 56 K and 5489 ± 60 K for the primary and secondary, respectively. A comparison of these properties with the predictions of current stellar evolution models for the known age and metallicity of the cluster shows only minor differences.

<div> Gaia Data Release 3, binary stars, Newtonian dynamics, kinematic acceleration ratio, gravitational anomaly<br />
总结:<br />
本研究基于Gaia Data Release 3的数据，发现了一些关于双星系统的引力异常现象。在对天体测量和径向速度进行了严格要求的情况下，研究发现了纯粹的双星系统，符合牛顿力学，但在较大距离下却显示出与牛顿预期有明显偏差的运动。这一发现在数据分析中得到了验证，并得出了相应的运动加速度比率，证实了在低加速度下存在引力异常现象。 <div>
It is found that Gaia Data Release 3 binary stars selected with stringent requirements on astrometric measurements and radial velocities naturally satisfy Newtonian dynamics without hidden close companions when the projected separation s ≲ 2 kau, showing that pure binaries can be selected. It is then found that pure binaries selected with the same criteria show a systematic deviation from the Newtonian expectation when s ≳ 2 kau. When both proper motions and parallaxes are required to have precision better than 0.005 and radial velocities better than 0.2, I obtain 2463 statistically pure binaries within a “clean” G-band absolute magnitude range. From this sample, I obtain an observed-to-Newtonian predicted kinematic acceleration ratio of {\gamma }_{g}={g}_{\mathrm{obs}}/{g}_{\mathrm{pred}}={1.49}_{-0.19}^{+0.21} for acceleration ≲10−10 m s−2, in excellent agreement with 1.49 ± 0.07 for a much larger general sample with the amount of hidden close companions self-calibrated. I also investigate the radial profile of stacked sky-projected relative velocities without a deprojection to the 3D space. The observed profile matches the Newtonian predicted profile for s ≲ 2 kau without any free parameters, but shows a clear deviation at a larger separation with a significance of ≈5.0σ. The projected velocity boost factor for s ≳ 5 kau is measured to be {\gamma }_{{v}_{p}}=1.20\pm 0.06 (stat) ±0.05 (sys) matching \sqrt{{\gamma }_{g}}. Finally, for a small sample of 40 binaries with exceptionally precise radial velocities (fractional errors &lt;0.005), the directly measured relative velocities in the 3D space also show a boost at larger separations. These results robustly confirm the recently reported gravitational anomaly at low acceleration for a general sample.

<title>Influence of Jets on [O iii] Extensions in Green Pea/Bean Galaxies</title>

<div> 关键词: Green Peas, Green Beans, [O iii] emission, jets, EELRs

研究调查了具有强烈[O iii]λ5007发射的星系（即绿豆和绿豌豆）受喷流影响的情况。研究样本包括12个附近源（z∼0.04–0.1，其中六个有喷流，六个没有喷流），具有高的[O iii]发光度（L∼1040 erg s−1），这些样本来自于斯隆数字化天空调查和二十厘米射电天空调查观测的射电选择星系样本。我们在每个星系上进行了大双望远镜-多对象双光谱仪的长条谱学观测，沿着两个位置角度进行观测：一个与喷流方向对齐，另一个垂直于喷流方向。通过沿着这些切口追踪[O iii]发射，我们旨在评估狭线区域的延伸并检查喷流的影响。令人惊讶的是，我们的分析显示[O iii]发射的延伸没有首选方向，这表明喷流对延伸的发射线区域（EELRs）影响有限。这也暗示了可能会漏掉与喷流对齐的圆锥形EELRs的检测，这归因于我们的切口方向。此外，我们比较了跟踪星形区域的[O ii]发射与[O iii]的延伸。我们观察到了显著的差异，[O ii]沿着星系平面展示了更大的延伸，这表明[O ii]发射与恒星过程的关联更加强烈。

<br /><br />总结:
1. 研究对象为具有高 [O iii] 发射的星系，分为有喷流和无喷流两组。
2. 使用长条谱学观测评估了狭线区域的延伸，并检查了喷流的影响。
3. 结果显示喷流对延伸的发射线区域影响有限，没有首选方向。
4. 比较了 [O ii] 和 [O iii] 发射的延伸，发现 [O ii] 更与恒星过程关联。
5. 研究结果暗示可能漏掉与喷流对齐的圆锥形 EELRs 的检测。 <div>
We present a study investigating the influence of jets on galaxies exhibiting strong [O iii]λ5007 emission, known as Green Peas and Green Beans. Our sample comprised 12 nearby sources (z ∼ 0.04–0.1, six with jets and six without jets) with high [O iii] luminosity (L ∼ 1040 erg s−1), selected from a radio-selected galaxy sample observed with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters survey. We perform Large Binocular Telescope–Multi-Object Double Spectrograph long-slit spectroscopy at two position angles for each galaxy: one aligned with the jet direction and another perpendicular to it. By tracing the [O iii] emission along these slits, we aimed to assess the extension of the narrow line region and examine the impact of jets. Surprisingly, our analysis revealed no preferred direction for the extension of the [O iii] emission, indicating that jets have a limited influence on the extended emission line regions (EELRs). This also suggests the possibility of missed detection of conical-shaped EELRs aligned with the jets, attributable to our slit orientations. Furthermore, we compared the extension of [O ii] emission, which traces star-forming regions, with that of [O iii]. We observed a significant difference, with [O ii] exhibiting a considerably greater extension along the galactic plane. This suggests a stronger association of [O ii] emission with stellar processes.

<div> 关键词: spicules, transverse waves, coronal heating, p-modes, magneto-convection simulation

总结: <br /><br />此研究对太阳大气层中的横波进行了观测和模拟研究，发现高频率的横波振荡与长时间尺度的颗粒运动有着明显的区别，并提出了它们是通过纵波的模式转换而产生的。研究通过二维磁流体对流模拟，并在底部边界引入了类似p模式的激励源，发现了纵波向横波的能量转移效应，使得横波振荡的振幅和能量通量都得到了显著增加。这些发现为解释日冕的加热过程提供了重要线索。 <div>
Lateral motions of spicules serve as vital indicators of transverse waves in the solar atmosphere, and their study is crucial for understanding the wave-heating process of the corona. Recent observations have focused on high-frequency transverse waves (periods &lt; 100 s), which have the potential to transport sufficient energy for coronal heating. These high-frequency spicule oscillations are distinct from granular motions, which have much longer timescales of 5–10 minutes. Instead, it is proposed that they are generated through the mode conversion from high-frequency longitudinal waves that arise from a shock-steepening process. Therefore, these oscillations may not solely be produced by the horizontal buffeting motions of granulation but also by the leakage of p-mode oscillations. To investigate the contribution of p-modes, our study employs a two-dimensional magneto-convection simulation spanning from the upper convection zone to the corona. During the course of the simulation, we introduce a p-mode-like driver at the bottom boundary. We reveal a notable increase in the mean velocity amplitude of the transverse oscillations in spicules, ranging from 10%–30%, and attribute this to the energy transfer from longitudinal to transverse waves. This effect results in an enhancement of the estimated energy flux by 30%–80%.

<br />
卡西尼轨道飞行器紫外成像光谱仪（UVIS）从1999年到2017年获得了行星间的氢 Lyα 观测数据，其中2004年到2017年的观测数据是在土星轨道上获得的。飞船在土星轨道阶段从太阳圈层中的主要下风和侧风移动到上风位置。研究人员使用现有的热氢密度模型和最近用于研究太阳和日球观测器太阳风各向异性实验数据以及2003年到2004年间选定的卡西尼UVIS观测数据的太阳光照模型进行了所有观测数据分析。他们发现数据和模型之间存在一般的一致性，但有证据表明UVIS Lyα的灵敏度在2002年6月经历一次明显的下降，以及整体上近似线性下降。此前由普赛尔等人进行的工作使用UVIS实验室灵敏度校准拟合了2003年至2004年的UVIS Lyα数据，得出外太阳圈（但在外太阳圈边界进行了过滤）中的氢密度为0.085cm-3的估计值。然而，包括此处发现的灵敏度下降导致修订后的氢密度估计值为nH = 0.14 ± 0.03 cm−3。这一密度估计值与最近根据对新视野号飞船拾取氢离子观测的模型得出的终止冲击附近的中性氢密度估计值为0.127 ± 0.015 cm−3一致。 <br /><br />总结: 卡西尼轨道飞行器通过紫外成像光谱仪对行星间的氢进行观测，发现了UVIS Lyα灵敏度的下降，重新估计了外太阳圈的氢密度，与最近的模型观测结果一致。 <div>
The Cassini Orbiter Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) obtained interplanetary hydrogen Lyα observations from 1999 to 2017, with mid-2004 to 2017 observations obtained from Saturn orbit. During its Saturn orbital phase, the spacecraft moved from mostly downwind and sidewind in the heliosphere to upwind. We analyze the full set of observations with our existing hot hydrogen density model with a solar illumination model most recently used to study Solar and Heliospheric Observatory Solar Wind Anisotropy Experiment data and selected Cassini UVIS observations from 2003 to 2004. We find general agreement between data and model, but with evidence for a decline in UVIS Lyα sensitivity, with a significant decline in 2002 June during a starburn event and an overall roughly linear decline in sensitivity. While earlier work by Pryor et al. fit the UVIS Lyα data from 2003 to 2004 with a hydrogen density in the outer heliosphere (but after filtration at outer heliospheric boundaries) of 0.085  cm−3 using the UVIS laboratory sensitivity calibration, including the sensitivity decline found here leads to a revised hydrogen density estimate of nH = 0.14 ± 0.03 cm−3. This density estimate is consistent with a recent neutral hydrogen density estimate near the termination shock of 0.127 ± 0.015  cm−3 based on models of observations of pick-up hydrogen ions from the New Horizons spacecraft.

<div> PNS, neutrino emission, mass accretion, event rates, neutrino oscillation model
<br /><br />总结:
本研究通过对PNS质量回落至中子星的恒星上的物质吸积，利用完整的玻尔兹曼中微子输运进行中微子辐射-流体动力学模拟，调查了由物质吸积导致的延迟中微子辐射。我们追踪了PNS的吸积流动的时间演化，直到系统达到准稳态。吸积流动中通常形成一个驻波震荡，而震荡半径因物质吸积率和PNS质量而异。在PNS附近（∼10 公里）出现温度急剧增加，表征了中微子的辐射。随着物质吸积率和PNS质量的增加，中微子的发光度和平均能量也会增加。发射的中微子的平均能量在10 ≲ ϵ ≲ 20 MeV范围内，高于PNS冷却模型估计的值（≲10 MeV）。假设恒星型核心崩溃距离为10千秒差距，我们量化了Super-Kamiokande（超级神农）和深地下中微子实验（DUNE）的中微子事件率。估计的检测率远高于背景噪声，并且其能量依赖特征与PNS冷却模型的预期有质的不同。另一个显著特征是中微子辐射对味道的依赖性强，表现出中微子振荡模型的相关性。我们在考虑绝热米克耶夫-斯米尔诺夫-沃尔芬斯坦模型的情况下对其进行估算，结果显示在Super-K和DUNE中，正常和反转质量序列分别提供了大量的中微子探测。因此，Super-K和DUNE同时观测回落中微子将对中微子质量排列提供强有力的约束。 <div>
We investigate the late-time neutrino emission powered by fallback mass accretion onto a protoneutron star (PNS), using neutrino radiation-hydrodynamic simulations with full Boltzmann neutrino transport. We follow the time evolution of the accretion flow onto the PNS until the system reaches a quasi-steady state. A standing shock wave is commonly formed in the accretion flow, whereas the shock radius varies depending on the mass accretion rate and the PNS mass. A sharp increase in temperature emerges in the vicinity of the PNS (∼10 km), which characterizes neutrino emission. Both the neutrino luminosity and the average energy become higher with increasing mass accretion rate and PNS mass. The mean energy of the emitted neutrinos is in the range of 10 ≲ ϵ ≲ 20 MeV, which is higher than that estimated from PNS cooling models (≲10 MeV). Assuming a distance to core-collapse supernova of 10 kpc, we quantify neutrino event rates for Super-Kamiokande (Super-K) and Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). The estimated detection rates are well above the background, and their energy-dependent features are qualitatively different from those expected from PNS cooling models. Another notable feature is that the neutrino emission is strongly flavor dependent, exhibiting that the neutrino event rate hinges on the neutrino oscillation model. We estimate them in the case with the adiabatic Mikheev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein model, and show that the normal and inverted mass hierarchy offer a large number of neutrino detections in Super-K and DUNE, respectively. Hence the simultaneous observation with Super-K and DUNE of fallback neutrinos will provide a strong constraint on the neutrino mass hierarchy.

Spiral-shaped wave patterns (SWPs) observed in sunspot umbrae represent the superposition of axisymmetric patterns and nonaxisymmetric patterns of umbral oscillations. These patterns give us physical information about the source of oscillations below the surface. Here we present the statistics of their observational properties determined from the 304 Å line-intensity data obtained with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory. From the 2013 to 2018 data set, we examined each of the 496 sunspots near the disk center for 2 hr. As a result, we identified 241 SWPs from 140 sunspots, which corresponds to the detection rate of 0.24 per hour in each sunspot. Most of the SWPs had one spiral arm, 48 SWPs had two arms, and only one had three. The oscillation period was estimated at 151 ± 27 s and the lifetime, at 770 ± 250 s, being comparable to those of conventional umbral oscillations. The rotation period of the SWPs was estimated at 190 ± 69 s for the one-armed SWPs and 299 ± 115 s for the two-armed SWPs. We found that the properties of the SWPs have no dependence on hemisphere, latitude, and sunspot size. From the apparent radial speeds of the SWPs and a simple model of wave propagation, we infer that the SWPs may be generated between 2 and 11 Mm below the photosphere with a mean value of about 6 Mm.

总结: <br />本文研究了来自太阳活动区和日冕孔区的等离子体射流的特征。研究发现，活动区中的射流源通常被吸收的色球物质所遮挡，而日冕孔区的射流则明显起源于喷发的小丝状物。文章通过观测和磁数据分析得出这一结论，并指出在活动区中，喷发的小丝状物可能会在射流显示出来之前失去小丝状物的特征。研究强调了日冕孔区和活动区射流特征的差异，为太阳活动的物理过程提供了重要参考。 <br /> <div>
Solar quiet- and coronal-hole region coronal jets frequently clearly originate from erupting minifilaments, but active-region jets often lack an obvious erupting-minifilament source. We observe a coronal-jet-productive active region (AR), AR 12824, over 2021 May 22 0–8 UT, primarily using Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Array (AIA) EUV images and SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager magnetograms. Jets were concentrated in two locations in the AR: on the south side and on the northwest side of the AR’s lone large sunspot. The south-location jets are oriented so that we have a clear view of the jets’ origin low in the atmosphere: their source is clearly minifilaments erupting from locations showing magnetic flux changes/cancelations. After erupting a projected distance ≲5″ away from their origin site, the minifilaments erupt outward onto far-reaching field as part of the jet’s spire, quickly losing their minifilament character. In contrast, the northwest-location jets show no clear erupting minifilament, but the source site of those jets are obscured along our line of sight by absorbing chromospheric material. EUV and magnetic data indicate that the likely source sites were ≳15″ from where the we first see the jet spire; thus, an erupting minifilament would likely lose its minifilament character before we first see the spire. We conclude that such AR jets could work like non-AR jets, but the erupting-minifilament jet source is often hidden by obscuring material. Another factor is that magnetic eruptions making some AR jets carry only a harder-to-detect comparatively thin (∼1″–2″) minifilament “strand.”

<br /><br />总结: GECKO项目旨在快速识别引力波事件的电磁波对应体——巨新星(KN)，并成功使用该策略在O3期间对GW190425进行了观测并发现了十个瞬变现象，但没有找到巨新星。GECKO观测展示了在定位区域约为数百平方度的情况下，可能能够发现距离<200 Mpc的GW170817-like KN。 <div>
One of the keys to the success of multimessenger astronomy is the rapid identification of the electromagnetic wave counterpart, kilonova (KN), of the gravitational-wave (GW) event. Despite its importance, it is hard to find a KN associated with a GW event, due to a poorly constrained GW localization map and numerous signals that could be confused as a KN. Here, we present the Gravitational-wave Electromagnetic wave Counterpart Korean Observatory (GECKO) project, the GECKO observation of GW190425, and prospects of GECKO in the fourth observing run (O4) of the GW detectors. We outline our follow-up observation strategies during O3. In particular, we describe our galaxy-targeted observation criteria that prioritize based on galaxy properties. Armed with this strategy, we performed an optical and/or near-infrared follow-up observation of GW190425, the first binary neutron star merger event during the O3 run. Despite a vast localization area of 7460 deg2, we observed 621 host galaxy candidates, corresponding to 29.5% of the scores we assigned, with most of them observed within the first 3 days of the GW event. Ten transients were discovered during this search, including a new transient with a host galaxy. No plausible KN was found, but we were still able to constrain the properties of potential KNe using upper limits. The GECKO observation demonstrates that GECKO can possibly uncover a GW170817-like KN at a distance &lt;200 Mpc if the localization area is of the order of hundreds of square degrees, providing a bright prospect for the identification of GW electromagnetic wave counterparts during the O4 run.

本研究报告了在早期宇宙时期（5.6 <7.0）对131个低亮度类星体的黑洞质量和厄ddington比率进行估计的分布情况。该研究基于Subaru Telescope安装的Hyper Suprime-Cam的调查数据，构建了一个低亮度类星体样本，其M1450∼-21等IL 。这些类星体的发现光谱仅限于约1200-1400埃的固有波长范围，不包含可用作黑洞质量估计器的发射线。为了解决这个问题，我们利用斯隆数字化巡天中的低z对应光谱，这些光谱在重叠波长范围内与高z光谱匹配。然后，我们将对应的C iv发射线宽度与SHELLQs数据的连续光度结合起来估算黑洞质量。结果显示，黑洞质量分布范围约为107-10M⊙，大多数类星体的黑洞质量约为108M⊙，具有次Eddington流。本研究不仅为我们提供了有关再电离时期正常类星体的新见解，还为准确估算没有近红外光谱高z类星体的黑洞质量提供了新的有效方法。<br /><br />总结: 本研究基于SHELLQs项目的数据，针对低亮度类星体进行了黑洞质量和厄ddington比率的估计。利用光谱匹配和连续光度估算相结合的方法，得出了黑洞质量分布范围和大多数类星体的特征。研究结果不仅为我们提供了有关再电离时期正常类星体的新见解，还提出了一个新的有效方法来估算高z类星体的黑洞质量。 <div>
We report the distribution of black hole (BH) masses and Eddingont ratios estimated for a sample of 131 low luminosity quasars in the early cosmic epoch (5.6 &lt; z &lt; 7.0). Our work is based on the Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) project, which has constructed a low luminosity quasar sample down to M1450 ∼ − 21 mag, exploiting the survey data of Hyper Suprime-Cam installed on Subaru Telescope. The discovery spectra of these quasars are limited to the rest-frame wavelengths of ∼1200–1400 Å, which contain no emission lines that can be used as BH mass estimators. In order to overcome this problem, we made use of low-z counterpart spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which are spectrally matched to the high-z spectra in overlapping wavelengths. We then combined the C iv emission line widths of the counterparts with the continuum luminosity from the SHELLQs data to estimate BH masses. The resulting BH mass distribution has a range of ∼107–10M⊙, with most of the quasars having BH masses ∼108M⊙ with sub-Eddington accretion. The present study provides not only a new insight into normal quasars in the reionization epoch, but also a new promising way to estimate BH masses of high-z quasars without near-infrared spectroscopy.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用二维全粒子动力学电磁粒子模拟，针对在典型日冕条件下弱磁化等离子体中的高次谐波发射过程进行了研究。研究发现，较大的束流速度有利于产生更高次谐波的辐射，并且随着谐波序数的增加，辐射强度递减。此外，H3辐射主要通过H2辐射与朗道波的合并生成，而H4辐射主要来源于H3辐射与正向/反向传播的朗道波的合并。这些发现有助于揭示高次谐波辐射的产生机制。 <div>
Electromagnetic radiation at higher harmonics of the plasma frequency (ω ∼ nωpe, n &gt; 2) has been occasionally observed in type II and type III solar radio bursts, yet the underlying mechanism remains undetermined. Here we present two-dimensional fully kinetic electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations with high spectral resolution to investigate the beam-driven plasma emission process in weakly magnetized plasmas of typical coronal conditions. We focused on the generation mechanisms of high-harmonic emission. We found that a larger beam velocity (ud) favors the generation of the higher-harmonic emission. The emissions grow later for higher harmonics and decrease in intensity by ∼2 orders of magnitude for each jump of the harmonic number. The second and third harmonic (H2 and H3) emissions get closer in intensity with larger ud. We also show that (1) the H3 emission is mainly generated via the coalescence of the H2 emission with the Langmuir waves, i.e., H2 + L → H3, wherein the coalescence with the forward-propagating beam-Langmuir wave leads to the forward-propagating H3, and coalescence with the backward-propagating Langmuir wave leads to the backward-propagating H3; and (2) the H4 emission mainly arises from the coalescence of the H3 emission with the forward- (backward-)propagating Langmuir wave, in terms of H3 + L → H4.

We report on integral field unit (IFU) measurements of the host of the radio source 4C+37.11. This massive elliptical contains the only resolved double compact nucleus at parsec-scale separation, likely a bound supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB). i-band photometry and GMOS-N IFU spectroscopy show that the galaxy has a large rb = 1.″5 core and that the stellar velocity dispersion increases inside of a radius of influence rSOI ≈ 1.″3. Jeans Anisotropic Modeling analysis of the core infers a total SMBHB mass of {2.8}_{-0.8}^{+0.8}\times {10}^{10}{M}_{\odot }, making this one of the most massive black hole systems known. Our data indicate that there has been significant scouring of the central kiloparsec of the host galaxy.

<div> 关键词: 电子密度, 窄发射线区域, 活动星系核, 统一模型, SDSS Data Release 12

总结: 
该研究在SDSS Data Release 12中针对活动星系核（AGN）的Type-1和Type-2进行了电子密度（ne）的比较。研究发现Type-1 AGN的NLRs中的ne要高于Type-2 AGN，并提出了AGN活动时间长、导致更多电子注入NLRs的可能解释，以及Type-2 AGN中更强烈的星形成贡献导致ne较低的可能解释。这些结果对广泛认可的AGN统一模型提出了有趣的挑战。<br /><br /> <div>
In the manuscript, we check properties of electron densities ne traced by flux ratio Rsii of [S ii]λ6716 Å to [S ii]λ6731 Å in narrow emission line regions (NLRs) between Type-1 active galactic nucleus (AGN) and Type-2 AGN in SDSS Data Release 12 (DR12). Under the framework of unified model considering kiloparsec-scale structures, similar ne in NLRs should be expected between Type-1 AGN and Type-2 AGN. Based on reliable measurements of the [S ii] doublet with measured parameters at least 5 times larger than corresponding uncertainties, there are 6039 Type-1 AGN and 8725 Type-2 AGN (excluding the Type-2 LINERs and the composite galaxies) collected from SDSS DR12. Then, lower Rsii (higher ne) in NLRs can be well confirmed in Type-1 AGN than in Type-2 AGN, with the confidence level higher than 5σ, even after considering the necessary effects including effects of electron temperatures traced by [O iii]λ4364,4959,5007 Å on estimating ne in NLRs. Two probable methods are proposed to explain the higher ne in NLRs in Type-1 AGN. First, the higher ne in NLRs of Type-1 AGN could indicate longer time durations of AGN activities in Type-1 AGN than in Type-2 AGN, if AGN activities triggering galactic-scale outflows leading to more electrons injecting into NLRs were accepted to explain the higher ne in NLRs of Type-2 AGN than H ii galaxies. Second, the lower ne in NLRs of Type-2 AGN could be explained by stronger star-forming contributions in Type-2 AGN, considering lower ne in H ii regions. The results provide interesting challenges to the commonly and widely accepted unified model of AGN.

The chromatic contamination that arises from photospheric heterogeneities, e.g., spots and faculae on the host star presents a significant noise source for exoplanet transmission spectra. If this contamination is not corrected for, it can introduce substantial bias in our analysis of the planetary atmosphere. We utilize two stellar models of differing complexity, StARPA (Stellar Activity Removal for Planetary Atmospheres) and ASteRA (Active Stellar Retrieval Algorithm), to explore the biases introduced by stellar contamination in retrieval under differing degrees of stellar activity. We use the retrieval framework TauREx3 and a grid of 27 synthetic, spot-contaminated transmission spectra to investigate potential biases and to determine how complex our stellar models must be in order to accurately extract the planetary parameters from transmission spectra. The input observation is generated using the more complex model (StARPA), in which the spot latitude is an additional, fixable parameter. This observation is then fed into a combined stellar-planetary retrieval, which contains a simplified stellar model (ASteRA). Our results confirm that the inclusion of stellar activity parameters in retrieval minimizes bias under all activity regimes considered. ASteRA performs very well under low-to-moderate activity conditions, retrieving the planetary parameters with a high degree of accuracy. For the most active cases, characterized by larger, higher-temperature contrast spots, some minor residual bias remains due to ASteRA neglecting the interplay between the spot and the limb-darkening effect. As a result of this, we find larger errors in retrieved planetary parameters for central spots (0°) and those found close to the limb (60°) than those at intermediate latitudes (30°).

事件视界望远镜合作团队首次发布了对M87*和Sgr A*超大质量黑洞的单位视界图像，并提供了其周围物理条件的初步信息。他们使用三维广义相对论磁流体力学模拟与观测进行比较，初步约束了这些黑洞时空的特性。然而，由于观测辐射在改变等离子体和时空特性时产生的退化，准确区分吸积流的性质和时空特性仍具有挑战性。下一代事件视界望远镜观测预计将通过探索盘-喷流动力学的复杂相互作用来消除一些这些退化。GRMHD模拟和广义相对论辐射传输的计算结果显示，喷流的径向和方位动态与黑洞自旋密切相关。基于ngEHT对M87*的分辨率和图像重建能力，我们能够评估这种相关性的检测性和相关的不确定性。总的来说，我们的结果有助于评估未来事件视界望远镜观测来约束黑洞自旋的前景。 <br /><br />总结: 超大质量黑洞M87*和Sgr A*的首张单位视界图像的发布和通过GRMHD模拟研究黑洞自旋的相关性，有望为未来事件视界望远镜观测提供了约束黑洞自旋的前景。 <div>
The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration has recently published the first horizon-scale images of the supermassive black holes M87* and Sgr A* and provided some first information on the physical conditions in their vicinity. The comparison between the observations and the three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations has enabled the EHT to set initial constraints on the properties of these black hole spacetimes. However, accurately distinguishing the properties of the accretion flow from those of the spacetime, most notably, the black hole mass and spin, remains challenging because of the degeneracies the emitted radiation suffers when varying the properties of the plasma and those of the spacetime. The next-generation EHT (ngEHT) observations are expected to remove some of these degeneracies by exploring the complex interplay between the disk–jet dynamics, which represents one of the most promising tools for extracting information on the black hole spin. By using GRMHD simulations of magnetically arrested disks and general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) calculations of the emitted radiation, we have studied the properties of the jet and the accretion disk dynamics on spatial scales that are comparable with the horizon. In this way, we are able to highlight that the radial and azimuthal dynamics of the jet are well correlated with the black hole spin. Based on the resolution and image reconstruction capabilities of the ngEHT observations of M87*, we can assess the detectability and associated uncertainty of this correlation. Overall, our results serve to assess the prospects for constraining the black hole spin with future EHT observations.

总结:
本研究分析了64个benchmark late-M和L矮星的金属丰度和J-K颜色之间的关系，发现它们显示出正相关性。对比实验结果和Drift-Phoenix模型预测的关系，发现金属丰度越高的天体在光度上表现更红。作者推测这是因为更高的金属丰度导致了这些大气层中更多的凝结物形成，使得这些超冷矮星在光度上显得更红。 <div>
We examine the relationship between metallicity and J − K color for 64 benchmark late-M and L dwarfs, all of which are wide companions to higher-mass stars, and six of which are new discoveries. We assess the correlation between the Δ(J − K) color anomaly (the difference in an object’s J − K color from the median color for field objects of the same spectral type) and the metallicity of the host star to investigate how metallicity affects ultracool photospheres. Using Spearman’s rank correlation test and Student’s t-test, the late-M dwarf (L dwarf) sample’s Δ(J − K) and metallicity show a positive correlation at the 95% (90%) confidence level. A linear fit to color anomaly as a function of metallicity finds a slope of 0.17 ± 0.07 for the late-M dwarfs and a slope of {0.20}_{-0.08}^{+0.07} for the L dwarfs. We also computed the Δ(J − K) versus metallicity relationship predicted by multi-metallicity model spectra generated using Drift-Phoenix. The modeled late-M dwarfs show a slope of 0.202 ± 0.03, which is close to our observational results, but the modeled L dwarfs show a slope of 0.493 ± 0.02, steeper than our observational results. Both our empirical results and the models indicate that more metal-rich objects should appear redder photometrically. We speculate that higher metallicity drives more condensate formation in these atmospheres, thus making these ultracool dwarfs appear redder.

本研究利用JWST观测到的347个红移在4 < z < 9.5的星系，采用二维参数模型进行分析，测量星系的整体结构参数并量化其在真实光学波段的全局特性。研究着重于得出包括宇宙表面亮度衰减和分辨率影响在内的可靠不确定性。根据全局Sérsic指数(n < 1.5)和观测轴比(q < 0.6)的指导，我们将星系的旋盘现象的发生率保守地下限定为约45%。在4 < z < 9.5的红移范围内，星系的真实光学波段亮度和有效半径之间存在关系，分别在4 < z < 5和5 ≤ z < 9.5的区间内，具有相似的斜率，但较高红移区间的截距略低一些(Re = 0.69 ± 0.05 kpc)，而低红移区间的为(Re = 0.91 ± 0.04 kpc)。在目前样本规模的限制下，我们发现在这些早期时期，n或Re并没有显著的红移演化。 <div>
We analyze 347 galaxies at redshift 4 &lt; z &lt; 9.5 using JWST observations from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) program by simultaneously fitting a two-dimensional parametric model to the seven-filter Near Infrared Camera images to measure the overall structural parameters and quantify the global properties of the galaxies in the rest-frame optical band. Particular attention is devoted to deriving robust uncertainties that include, among other factors, the influence of cosmological surface brightness dimming and resolution effects. Using the global Sérsic index (n &lt; 1.5) and observed axial ratio (q &lt; 0.6) as a guide, we place a conservative lower limit of ∼45% on the incidence of galactic disks. Galaxies follow a relation between the rest-frame optical luminosity and effective radius in the redshift range 4 &lt; z &lt; 9.5, as well as separately over the intervals 4 &lt; z &lt; 5 and 5 ≤ z &lt; 9.5, with a very similar slope but a marginally lower zero-point in the higher-redshift bin (Re = 0.69 ± 0.05 kpc) compared to the lower-redshift bin (Re = 0.91 ± 0.04 kpc). Within the limitations of the current sample size, we find no significant redshift evolution of n or Re at these early epochs.

<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用强引力透镜效应的时间延迟距离来锚定宇宙距离，结合类星体作为辅助探测器，使用模型无关的方法确定哈勃常数H0。通过模拟数据集和高斯过程回归，我们展示了利用高红移的类星体可以扩展SNe Ia的红移范围，提高强透镜时间延迟距离测量的精确度。在时间延迟距离不确定性为距离数值的5%时，我们将H0的估计精度从2.1%提高到1.3%。 <div>
Absolute distances from strong lensing can anchor Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) at cosmological distances giving a model-independent inference of the Hubble constant (H0). Future observations could provide strong lensing time-delay distances with source redshifts up to z  ≃  4, which are much higher than the maximum redshift of SNe Ia observed so far. In order to make full use of time-delay distances measured at higher redshifts, we use quasars as a complementary cosmic probe to measure cosmological distances at redshifts beyond those of SNe Ia and provide a model-independent method to determine H0. In this work, we demonstrate a model-independent, joint constraint of SNe Ia, quasars, and time-delay distances from strong lensed quasars. We first generate mock data sets of SNe Ia, quasar, and time-delay distances based on a fiducial cosmological model. Then, we calibrate the quasar parameters model independently using Gaussian process (GP) regression with mock SNe Ia data. Finally, we determine the value of H0 model-independently using GP regression from mock quasars and time-delay distances from strong lensing systems. As a comparison, we also show the H0 results obtained from mock SNe Ia in combination with time-delay lensing systems whose redshifts overlap with SNe Ia. Our results show that quasars at higher redshifts show great potential to extend the redshift coverage of SNe Ia and thus enable the full use of strong lens time-delay distance measurements from ongoing cosmic surveys and improve the accuracy of the estimation of H0 from 2.1% to 1.3% when the uncertainties of the time-delay distances are 5% of the distance values.

Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the solar corona are often started from a potential field initial condition, which may be far from the true state of the coronal magnetic field. To test the sensitivity of the simulations to the initial condition, an electric-field-driven MHD code was initiated from three different initial conditions: the commonly used potential field, a nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation, which is believed to be a better representation of the true coronal magnetic field, and a purely vertical field. After relaxation, the magnetic field in the MHD simulations was compared. It was found that there is a tendency for all of the initial conditions to converge to a similar connectivity, particularly in areas of strong fields that are not close to the boundary, suggesting that the final state of the simulation is not particularly sensitive to the initial condition. The relaxed solution more closely resembles the NLFFF initial condition than the other initial conditions, but still exhibits substantial differences from it.

总结: 本研究通过对STEREO任务观测到的152个太阳风耀斑进行了研究，发现其波矢偏离太阳-航天器线的绝对值比密度模型预测的分别大了3.72和2.10倍。通过蒙特卡洛模拟，探讨了密度不均匀对射电发射位置的影响，结果显示相对密度波动为0.40可以解释观测到的角度偏移。同时，多通量管太阳风模型证实了太阳风中存在这种数量级的相对密度波动。研究提出了一种波矢修正方法，以增强对太阳风中电子束的三角定位能力，证明了在使用这种修正后的射电三角定位可以可靠地跟踪太阳风中的电子束。 <div>
Interplanetary Type III bursts, generated by relativistic electron beams at solar flare reconnection sites, are explored through an investigation of 152 instances observed by the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory mission. This study reveals that the absolute values of the wavevector deviations from the Sun–spacecraft line are statistically 3.72 and 2.10 larger than predicted by the density model, assuming fundamental and harmonic emission, respectively. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we examine the impact of scattering by density inhomogeneities on the apparent locations of radio emissions in the interplanetary medium. The findings indicate that relative density fluctuations of 0.40 can account for the observed angular shift, a conclusion supported by the multiple flux-tube solar wind model, which confirms the presence of such magnitude of relative perpendicular density fluctuations in the solar wind. We propose a wavevector correction that incorporates this effect to enhance the triangulation of interplanetary Type III bursts, demonstrating that radio triangulation, with this correction, can reliably track electron beams in the interplanetary medium.

该研究关注最近光子探测器在测量暗物质方面的进展。研究人员提出使用具有角秒级视野和/或角分辨率的探测器来探测小矮星系（dSphs）中暗物质衰变产生的光子流。通过使用差分D因子来估计35个dSphs的信号流量，并发现相比传统估计，结果信号通量可以有超过1-10倍的增强。研究指出，8.2米斯巴鲁望远镜上安装的红外摄像机和光谱仪（IRCS）可以成为质量在eV范围内的暗物质探测器，特别是想桨粒子（ALPs）。观测德拉科或大熊星II dSphs与IRCS约1晚，将能够在质量范围1 eV≲ma≲2 eV内放置最严格的ALP暗物质限制。

Recent advances in photon detectors have provided exceptional sensitivities to dark matter with high angular resolution. Motivated by this, we present a detailed study of photon flux from dark matter decay in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) by focusing on the detectors with arcsecond-level field of view and/or angular resolution. We propose to use differential D-factors since such detectors are sensitive to their dark matter distributions. We carefully estimate the differential D-factors of 35 dSphs. By using the differential D-factors, it turns out that the resulting signal flux can have a more than { \mathcal O }(1–10) enhancement compared to conventional estimations. Based on this analysis, we find that the Infrared Camera and Spectrograph (IRCS) installed on the 8.2 m Subaru Telescope can be an excellent dark matter detector for the mass in the eV range, particularly axion-like particles (ALPs). Observing the Draco or Ursa Major II dSphs with the IRCS for { \mathcal O }(1) night will enable us to place the most stringent bound for the ALP dark matter in the mass range of 1 eV ≲ ma ≲ 2 eV.

<div> 磁流体力学，环形磁场，极向场生成，初始场强，模拟演化 <br /><br /> 这是一项关于磁流体力学的模拟研究，探讨了不同初始磁场强度对大尺度极向场生成的影响。研究发现，不同磁场强度的模拟在演化早期即开始出现差异，并在研究期间保持明显差异，表明初始磁条件在模拟中留下持久的痕迹。两种模拟均无法进入磁控制的盘状态。模拟发现，从初始环形磁场中产生了极向场，初始磁场强度对模拟盘演化起着至关重要的作用。另外，作者指出，弱磁场和盘内网格细化边界的组合可能会引入计算人为失真，表现为弱场模拟中产生m=1模态的过密现象。 <div>
We present the results from a pair of high-resolution, long-timescale (∼105GM/c3), global, three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical accretion disk simulations with differing initial magnetic plasma β in order to study the effects of the initial toroidal field strength on the production of a large-scale poloidal field. We initialize our disks in approximate equilibrium with purely toroidal magnetic fields of strength β0 = 5 and 200. We also perform a limited resolution study. We find that simulations of differing field strengths diverge early in their evolution and remain distinct over the time studied, indicating that the initial magnetic conditions leave a persistent imprint in our simulations. Neither simulation enters the magnetically arrested disk regime. Both simulations are able to produce poloidal fields from initially toroidal fields, with the β0 = 5 simulation evolving clear signs of a large-scale poloidal field. We make a cautionary note that computational artifacts in the form of large-scale vortices may be introduced in the combination of initially weak field and disk-internal mesh refinement boundaries, as evidenced by the production of an m = 1 mode overdensity in the weak field simulation. Our results demonstrate that the initial toroidal field strength plays a vital role in the simulated disk evolution for the models studied.

总结:<br /><br />
这项研究使用ACT和WISE的观测数据进行了交叉相关分析，发现了在WISE×ACT TT交叉功率谱中30σ显著性的空间各向同性信号，被解释为ACT频率下的宇宙红外背景与WISE中的多环芳烃（PAH）发射的相关性。在银河系内，观测到星际尘埃光谱在范围103 < ℓ < 104内通常可以用幂律描述，但在一些地区表现出幂律指数的可变性和非幂律行为。研究还发现在35个不同的∼100平方度天空区域中，WISE总强度和ACT E模极化之间存在正相关关系，表明银河密度结构与局部磁场的对齐性在这些区域保持到亚秒尺度。TE谱在所有107个区域中的分布偏向于正值，而TB谱没有这种偏向。这项工作是迄今为止对银河尘埃TE光谱的高ℓ测量，表明与高分辨率中红外观测尘埃辐射的交叉相关是约束毫米波长度下尘埃发射空间统计的有效工具。 <div>
We present a cross-correlation analysis between 1^{\prime} resolution total intensity and polarization observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) at 150 and 220 GHz and 15″ mid-infrared photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) over 107 12.°5 × 12.°5 patches of sky. We detect a spatially isotropic signal in the WISE×ACT TT cross-power spectrum at 30σ significance that we interpret as the correlation between the cosmic infrared background at ACT frequencies and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission from galaxies in WISE, i.e., the cosmic PAH background. Within the Milky Way, the Galactic dust TT spectra are generally well described by power laws in ℓ over the range 103  &lt;  ℓ  &lt;  104, but there is evidence both for variability in the power-law index and for non-power-law behavior in some regions. We measure a positive correlation between WISE total intensity and ACT E-mode polarization at 1000  &lt;  ℓ  ≲  6000 at &gt;3σ in each of 35 distinct ∼100 deg2 regions of the sky, suggesting that alignment between Galactic density structures and the local magnetic field persists to subparsec physical scales in these regions. The distribution of TE amplitudes in this ℓ range across all 107 regions is biased to positive values, while there is no evidence for such a bias in the TB spectra. This work constitutes the highest-ℓ measurements of the Galactic dust TE spectrum to date and indicates that cross-correlation with high-resolution mid-infrared measurements of dust emission is a promising tool for constraining the spatial statistics of dust emission at millimeter wavelengths.

总结: <br /><br />这项研究观察了NOAA活跃区13023中两个相邻的太阳黑子、它们之间的间隙以及大量从间隙和太阳黑子外沿传播出的磁特征。研究发现，磁场倾斜角度不同的磁特征(MMFs)可以分为垂直型和水平型，其磁通量生成速率平均比太阳黑子的磁通量丢失速率高出5.6倍。特别是垂直型磁特征的磁通量大约是两个太阳黑子总丢失磁通量的1.4倍。这些观察结果表明，具有垂直磁场的磁特征与太阳黑子的解体密切相关，并且间隙中的磁特征的磁通量约为总磁通量的三分之一，大部分的垂直型磁特征可能直接源自太阳黑子的本质。 <div>
The relationship between the decay of sunspots and moving magnetic features (MMFs) plays an important role in understanding the evolution of active regions. We present observations of two adjacent sunspots, the gap between them, and a lot of MMFs propagating from the gap and the sunspots' outer edges in NOAA Active Region 13023. The MMFs are divided into two types based on their magnetic field inclination angle: vertical (0° &lt; γ &lt; 45°) and horizontal (45° ≤ γ &lt; 90°) MMFs (V-MMFs and H-MMFs, respectively). The main results are as follows: (1) the mean magnetic flux decay rates of the two sunspots are −1.7 × 1020 and −1.4 × 1020 Mx day−1; (2) the magnetic flux generation rate of all MMFs is calculated to be −1.9 × 1021 Mx day−1, which is on average 5.6 times higher than the total magnetic flux loss rate of the sunspots; (3) the magnetic flux of V-MMFs (including a pore separated from the sunspots) is 1.4 times larger than the total lost magnetic flux of the two sunspots, and in a later stage when the pore has passed through the reference ellipse, the magnetic flux generation rate of the V-MMFs is almost the same as the magnetic flux loss rate of the sunspots; and (4) within the gap, the magnetic flux of V-MMFs is one-third of the total magnetic flux. Few V-MMFs stream out from the sunspots at the nongap region. All observations suggest that MMFs with vertical magnetic fields are closely related to the disintegration of the sunspot, and most of the MMFs from the gap may originate directly from the sunspot umbra.

该研究通过高分辨率模拟，重点研究了一个质量约为1011M⊙的孤立星系的星风驱动情况。研究采用了可解析的恒星反馈模型，并考虑了光电加热和光电离辐射以及超新星等多种因素。研究发现，星系的平均星形成率约为0.05 M⊙ yr−1，质量和能量的平均装载因子分别约为1.0和0.01。星风的大部分质量是由温暖相(温度小于5 × 105 K)输运的，而能量在温暖相和热相(温度大于5 × 105 K)中输运的量相近。此外，星风的平均开合角约为30°，并且质量和能量的装载因子随着星形成表面速率密度的变化呈现出不同的趋势。该研究结果与前期的星风驱动模拟结果吻合良好。 <br /><br />总结: 孤立星系的高分辨率模拟研究发现，星风由温暖和热相输送大量质量和能量，开合角约为30°，而质量和能量的装载因子随星形成速率密度变化呈现出不同的趋势。 <div>
We present the first results from a high-resolution simulation with a focus on galactic wind driving for an isolated galaxy with a halo mass of ∼1011M⊙ (similar to the Large Magellanic Cloud) and a total gas mass of ∼6 × 108M⊙, resulting in ∼108 gas cells at ∼4 M⊙ mass resolution. We adopt a resolved stellar feedback model with nonequilibrium cooling and heating, including photoelectric heating and photoionizing radiation, as well as supernovae, coupled to the second-order meshless finite-mass method for hydrodynamics. These features make this the largest resolved interstellar medium (ISM) galaxy model run to date. We find mean star formation rates around 0.05 M⊙ yr−1 and evaluate typical time-averaged loading factors for mass (ηM ∼ 1.0, in good agreement with recent observations) and energy (ηE ∼ 0.01). The bulk of the mass of the wind is transported by the warm (T &lt; 5 × 105 K) phase, while there is a similar amount of energy transported in the warm and the hot phases (T &gt; 5 × 105 K). We find an average opening angle of 30° for the wind, decreasing with higher altitude above the midplane. The wind mass loading is decreasing (flat) for the warm (hot) phase as a function of the star formation surface rate density ΣSFR, while the energy loading shows inverted trends with ΣSFR, decreasing for the warm wind and increasing for the hot wind, although with very shallow slopes. These scalings are in good agreement with previous simulations of resolved wind driving in the multiphase ISM.

<div> 关键词: Asteroseismology, δ Scuti stars, mass, metallicity, age

总结: 
通过使用最小二乘法，从光度、光谱和星震观测中推断了60颗δ Scuti星的模型相关质量、金属丰度和年龄。发现大多数这些星的质量约为1.6太阳质量，金属丰度低于Z = 0.010。观察到了这些星年龄的双峰分布，大多数样本年龄小于30百万年，而其余的被推断为年龄较大，即数亿年。这项工作强调了大频率间隔（Δν）在δ Scuti星研究中的重要性。设计了三种机器学习模型，有望以更低的计算成本和更快的速度推断这些参数。这些模型还揭示了约束偶极模式可以显著改善年龄估计的重要性，径向模式简洁地包含了关于光度和温度的信息。使用机器学习模型，还对在估计质量、金属丰度和年龄时的星体可观测量的重要性进行了定性洞察。有效温度Teff大大影响了所有结构参数的推断，而星震偏移参数ϵ在年龄推断中起着重要作用。 <div>
Asteroseismology is a powerful tool to probe stellar structure. Spaceborne instruments like CoRoT, Kepler, and TESS have observed the oscillations of numerous stars, among which δ Scutis are particularly interesting, owing to their fast rotation and complex pulsation mechanisms. In this work, we inferred model-dependent masses, metallicities, and ages of 60 δ Scuti stars from photometric, spectroscopic, and asteroseismic observations using least-squares minimization. These statistics have the potential to explain why only a tiny fraction of δ Scuti stars pulsate in a very clean manner. We find most of these stars with masses around 1.6 M⊙ and metallicities below Z = 0.010. We observed a bimodality in age for these stars, with more than half the sample younger than 30 Myr, while the remaining ones were inferred to be older, i.e., hundreds of Myrs. This work emphasizes the importance of the large-frequency separation (Δν) in studies of δ Scutis. We also designed three machine-learning (ML) models that hold the potential for inferring these parameters at lower computational cost and much more rapidly. These models further revealed that constraining dipole modes can help in significantly improving age estimation and that radial modes succinctly encode information regarding luminosity and temperature. Using the ML models, we also gained qualitative insight into the importance of stellar observables in estimating mass, metallicity, and age. The effective temperature Teff strongly affects the inference of all structure parameters, and the asteroseismic offset parameter ϵ plays an essential role in the inference of age.

总结:<br /><br />这项研究利用火星大气和挥发性物质演化任务的观测结果，研究了离子沉降的季节变化。研究发现，从火星季节Ls 0°–180°到Ls 180°–360°的过渡过程中存在一个减少的模式，表现为沉积离子流量的减少。此外，我们还发现地壳磁场对沉积离子流量的季节变化有重要影响，尤其在地壳磁场呈现强烈水平取向的地区，出现了相反的季节趋势。驱动这种离子沉降季节变化的物理机制可能是质量加载效应，可能减缓太阳风并影响磁排列。未来需要进行更详细的研究。 <div>
We investigate the seasonal variations of ion precipitation, utilizing observations from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission spanning from 2014 January 4 to 2023 February 14. Our analysis reveals that a diminishing pattern characterizes the transition from Mars season Ls 0°–180° to Mars season Ls 180°–360°, manifesting as a reduction in precipitating ion fluxes. Additionally, we discern a significant influence of the crustal magnetic field on the seasonal variations in precipitating ion fluxes. Intriguingly, within regions where the crustal magnetic field exhibits a strong quasi-horizontal orientation, opposite seasonal trends become evident. The underlying physical mechanism driving these seasonal variations in ion precipitation is probably attributed to the mass loading effect that may decelerate the solar wind and influence the magnetic pileup. A detailed investigation is further demanded in the future.

<br /><br />总结: 该研究利用Hinode/X射线望远镜观测到的日冕图像，研究了FOV受限情况下排除的辐照率的比例，并发现在太阳活动最低期间和太阳活动周期上升阶段，排除的比例最高。 <div>
Soft X-ray images of the Sun obtained with multiple broadband filters provide a simple and useful method to calculate averaged coronal temperature and emission measure, from which we can further calculate solar X-ray irradiance in physical units, e.g., watts per square meter. However, X-ray telescopes are often designed for pursuing high spatial resolution, and thus the field of view (FOV) of full-Sun images is often limited over the limb, extending to only ∼1.3 R⊙. This indicates that the irradiance obtained from the limited FOV may underestimate the true full-Sun irradiance by failing to count the contribution from outside the FOV. This work uses Hinode/X-Ray Telescope (XRT) coronal images observed up to 1.7 R⊙ to investigate the fraction of irradiance excluded from the FOVs limited in size. The analysis indicates that the irradiance obtained within 1.1 R⊙, which is used for XRT irradiance study, excludes ∼3.5%/∼7% of irradiance relative to the value within 1.2/1.7 R⊙, respectively, for the active corona observed in 2022 July. In contrast, the excluded fraction increases to ∼7%/∼13%, respectively, for the minimum corona observed in 2009 August. To further investigate the dependence of exclusion fraction on the Sun’s activity level, we process mission long Yohkoh/Soft X-ray Telescope full-Sun images to compare the irradiance within 1.1 and 0.9 R⊙ with that obtained from the maximum FOV of 1.2 R⊙. We confirm that the exclusion fraction is the largest in the period around solar minimum. We also find that the average value of exclusion fraction is slightly but measurably larger in the rising phase than the declining phase of the solar cycle.

<div> CH3O, CH2OH radicals, complex organic molecules, interstellar dust, water ice surface
总结:
CH3O和CH2OH自由基是星际尘埃中复杂有机分子(COMs)的重要前体，它们可以产生多种类型的COMs。为了更好地理解不同类型COMs的化学演变，确定CH3O和CH2OH的丰度比至关重要。最近的研究表明，在冰尘表面，CH3OH和OH的反应在形成CH3O和CH2OH自由基中起着重要作用。然而，目前还没有提出这些自由基丰度的定量细节。本文实验确定了在10K下CH3OH + OH反应在水冰表面的分支比(CH3O/CH2OH)为4.3 ± 0.6。此外，反应中产生的CH3O自由基即使在10K的低温下也会参与随后的扩散反应。这一事实对于在冷分子云中COMs形成模型提供了关键信息。 <div>
The CH3O and CH2OH radicals can be important precursors of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar dust. The COMs presumably originating from these radicals were abundantly found in various astronomical objects. Because each radical leads to different types of COMs, determining the abundance ratio of CH3O to CH2OH is crucial for a better understanding of the chemical evolution into various COMs. Recent work suggested that the reaction between CH3OH and OH on ice dust plays an important role in forming CH3O and CH2OH radicals. However, quantitative details on the abundance of these radicals have not been presented to date. Herein, we experimentally determined the branching ratio (CH3O/CH2OH) resulting from the CH3OH + OH reaction on the water ice surface at 10 K to be 4.3 ± 0.6. Furthermore, the CH3O product in the reaction would participate in subsequent diffusive reactions even at a temperature as low as 10 K. This fact should provide critical information for COMs formation models in cold molecular clouds.

Observations, however, show that the presence of outer CJs (&gt;1 au and ≳0.3MJup) correlates with the presence of inner super-Earths (at &lt;1 au). This observation may simply be a result of an enhanced initial reservoir of solids in the nebula required to form a CJ or a yet-to-be-determined mechanism assisted by the presence of the CJ. In this work, we focus on the latter alternative and study the orbital transport of planetesimals interior to a slightly eccentric (∼0.05) CJ subject to the gravity and drag from a viscously evolving gaseous disk. We find that a secular resonance sweeping inward through the disk gradually transports rings of planetesimals when their drag-assisted orbital decay is faster than the speed of the resonance scanning. This snowplow-like process leads to large concentration (boosted by a factor of ∼10–100) of size-segregated planetesimal rings with aligned apsidal lines, making their expected collisions less destructive, due to their reduced velocity dispersion. This process is efficient for a wide range of α-disk models (and thus disk lifetimes) and Jovian masses, peaking for values ∼1–5MJup, which are typical of observed CJs in radial velocity surveys. Overall, our work highlights the major role that the disk's gravity may have on the orbital redistribution of planetesimals, depicting a novel avenue by which CJs may enhance the formation of inner planetary systems, including super-Earths and perhaps even warm and hot Jupiters.

<div> SN Ia, Nebular-phase observations, SN 2022pul, 03fg-like subclass, White dwarf merger<br />
总结:<br />
这篇文章介绍了关于异常型Ia超新星SN 2022pul的星际物质(CSM)相互作用和光谱特征的观测。在光学和中红外波段，SN 2022pul的光变曲线early rise表现出两个不同的部分，与CSM相互作用相关。在光学方面，SN 2022pul类似于SN 2012dn，而在星云相中，SN 2022pul展现出了03fg-like subclass的多样性。最后，使用JWST的数据，得到了首个03fg-like超新星的光学到中红外星云光谱。研究结果表明，SN 2022pul是由一个白矮星在C/O-rich CSM中发生融合而产生。 <div>
Nebular-phase observations of peculiar Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) provide important constraints on progenitor scenarios and explosion dynamics for both these rare SNe and the more common, cosmologically useful SNe Ia. We present observations from an extensive ground- and space-based follow-up campaign to characterize SN 2022pul, a super-Chandrasekhar mass SN Ia (alternatively “03fg-like” SN), from before peak brightness to well into the nebular phase across optical to mid-infrared (MIR) wavelengths. The early rise of the light curve is atypical, exhibiting two distinct components, consistent with SN Ia ejecta interacting with dense carbon–oxygen (C/O)-rich circumstellar material (CSM). In the optical, SN 2022pul is most similar to SN 2012dn, having a low estimated peak luminosity (MB = −18.9 mag) and high photospheric velocity relative to other 03fg-like SNe. In the nebular phase, SN 2022pul adds to the increasing diversity of the 03fg-like subclass. From 168 to 336 days after peak B-band brightness, SN 2022pul exhibits asymmetric and narrow emission from [O i] λλ6300, 6364 (FWHM ≈ 2000 km s−1), strong, broad emission from [Ca ii] λλ7291, 7323 (FWHM ≈ 7300 km s−1), and a rapid Fe iii to Fe ii ionization change. Finally, we present the first ever optical-to-MIR nebular spectrum of an 03fg-like SN Ia using data from JWST. In the MIR, strong lines of neon and argon, weak emission from stable nickel, and strong thermal dust emission (with T ≈ 500 K), combined with prominent [O i] in the optical, suggest that SN 2022pul was produced by a white dwarf merger within C/O-rich CSM.

总结:<br />
这篇论文提出了一个框架，用于对星体年龄进行概率预测，并使用SHapley Additive exPlanations来量化恒星演化和银河化学演化对这些预测的贡献。他们将这种可解释的预测框架应用于既包含各种演化阶段的模拟银河样本，又包含APOGEE模拟样本的红巨星。他们发现在前一种情况下，恒星演化是年龄估计的主要驱动因素，而在后一种情况下，由于演化信息受限，模型通过化学演化模型来估算年龄。他们还指出，由于使用了非内在的银河化学信息，估算出的趋势，如年龄-金属丰度关系，可能会偏离真实情况。 <div>
Stellar ages are key for determining the formation history of the Milky Way, but are difficult to measure precisely. Furthermore, methods that use chemical abundances to infer ages may entangle the intrinsic evolution of stars with the chemodynamical evolution of the Galaxy. In this paper, we present a framework for making probabilistic predictions of stellar ages, and then quantify the contribution of both stellar evolution and Galactic chemical evolution to those predictions using SHapley Additive exPlanations. We apply this interpretable prediction framework to both a simulated Milky Way sample containing stars in a variety of evolutionary stages and an APOGEE-mocked sample of red clump stars. We find that in the former case, stellar evolution is the dominant driver for age estimates, while in the latter case, the more restricted evolutionary information causes the model to proxy ages through the chemical evolution model. We show that as a result of the use of nonintrinsic Galactic chemical information, trends estimated with the predicted ages, such as the age–metallicity relation, can deviate from the truth.

<div> SDO, HMI, solar flares, proton beam heating, sunquakes
<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了太阳耀斑的一种可能机制，即通过非热的幂律分布的质子束加热大气层，产生的质子束加热模型可以解释HMI仪器的连续可观测性的增强，并在一定程度上解释了引起太阳地震的过程。研究发现能量较高的质子束（大于500keV）在HMI仪器的连续可观测性中表现更为显著，而能量较低的质子束（小于100keV）在引起太阳地震的过程中表现更为强烈，这为太阳耀斑的热加热机制提供了新的理论解释。 <div>
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) observations reveal a class of solar flares with substantial energy and momentum impacts in the photosphere, concurrent with white-light emission and helioseismic responses, known as sunquakes. Previous radiative hydrodynamic modeling has demonstrated the challenges of explaining sunquakes in the framework of the standard flare model of “electron beam” heating. One of the possibilities to explain the sunquakes and other signatures of the photospheric impact is to consider additional heating mechanisms involved in solar flares, for example via flare-accelerated protons. In this work, we analyze a set of single-loop Fokker–Planck and radiative hydrodynamics RADYN+FP simulations where the atmosphere is heated by nonthermal power-law-distributed proton beams which can penetrate deeper than the electron beams into the low atmospheric layers. Using the output of the RADYN models, we calculate synthetic Fe i 6173 Å line Stokes profiles and from those the line-of-sight observables of the SDO/HMI instrument, as well as the 3D helioseismic response, and compare them with the corresponding observational characteristics. These initial results show that the models with proton beam heating can produce the enhancement of the HMI continuum observable and explain qualitatively the generation of sunquakes. The continuum observable enhancement is evident in all models but is more prominent in ones with Ec ≥ 500 keV. In contrast, the models with Ec ≤ 100 keV provide a stronger sunquake-like helioseismic impact according to the 3D acoustic modeling, suggesting that low-energy (deka- and hecto-keV) protons have an important role in the generation of sunquakes.

总结: 中国空间站POLAR-2实验的LPD有效载荷是低能X射线偏振检测器，用于观测2-10keV能量范围内的伽马射线暴快速辐射的偏振情况。该设备具有90°的广角视场，在预设计中采用了基于气体像素探测器的X射线光电偏振计组成的阵列。通过GEANT4 C++软件包进行了详细模拟，发现LPD的主要背景成分包括宇宙X射线背景和明亮的X射线源。在施加带电粒子背景排除算法后，LPD的平均背景计数率约为0.55 counts cm–2 s–1，并随着探测器的轨道和指向方向而变化。此外，还进行了关于不同视场和探测器指向的宇宙X射线背景和X射线明亮源的综合模拟和比较分析。 <div>
The Low-Energy X-ray Polarization Detector (LPD) is one of the payloads in the POLAR-2 experiment, designed as an external payload for the China Space Station deployment in early 2026. LPD is specifically designed to observe the polarization of gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission in the energy range of 2–10 keV, with a wide field of view (FoV) of 90° in preliminary design. This observation is achieved using an array of X-ray photoelectric polarimeters based on gas pixel detectors. Due to the wide FoV configuration, the in-orbit background count rate in the soft X-ray range is high, while GRBs themselves also exhibit high flux in this energy band. In order to assess the contribution of various background components to the total count rate, we conducted detailed simulations using the GEANT4 C++ package. Our simulations encompassed the main interactions within the instrument materials and provided insights into various background components within the wide-FoV scheme. The simulation results reveal that among the background components, the primary contributors are the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) and bright X-ray sources. The total background count rate of LPD, after applying the charged particle background rejection algorithm, is approximately 0.55 counts cm–2 s–1 on average, and it varies with the detector’s orbit and pointing direction. Furthermore, we performed comprehensive simulations and comparative analyses of the CXB and X-ray bright sources under different FoVs and detector pointings. These analyses provide valuable insights into the background characteristics for soft X-ray polarimeter with wide FoV.

<title>Post-merger Gravitational-wave Signal from Neutron-star Binaries: A New Look at an Old Problem</title>

<div> gravitational-wave signal, neutron stars, equation of state, Weyl scalar, quasi-universal relation
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了双中子星合并所产生的引力波信号的频谱特性，以及这些特性所包含的关于系统和物质方程状态的信息。通过使用Weyl标量ψ4的特性，他们提出了一个新的瞬时频率{f}_{0}^{{\psi }_{4}}，并建立了与该频率相关的“准通用”关系。他们还推导了合并频率{f}_{\mathrm{mer}}^{h}的新“准通用”关系，并发现在足够长的时间尺度内，ℓ = 2, m = 1引力波模式的幅度可能与传统的ℓ = 2, m = 2模式相当，这些发现对引力波研究具有重要意义。 <div>
The spectral properties of the post-merger gravitational-wave signal from a binary of neutron stars encodes a variety of information about the features of the system and of the equation of state describing matter around and above nuclear saturation density. Characterizing the properties of such a signal is an “old” problem, which first emerged when a number of frequencies were shown to be related to the properties of the binary through “quasi-universal” relations. Here we take a new look at this old problem by computing the properties of the signal in terms of the Weyl scalar ψ4. In this way, and using a database of more than 100 simulations, we provide the first evidence for a new instantaneous frequency, {f}_{0}^{{\psi }_{4}}, associated with the instant of quasi-time-symmetry in the dynamics, and which also follows a quasi-universal relation. We also derive a new quasi-universal relation for the merger frequency {f}_{\mathrm{mer}}^{h}, which provides a description of the data that is 4 times more accurate than previous expressions while requiring fewer fitting coefficients. Finally, consistent with the findings of numerous studies before ours, and using an enlarged ensemble of binary systems, we point out that the ℓ = 2, m = 1 gravitational-wave mode could become comparable with the traditional ℓ = 2, m = 2 mode on sufficiently long timescales, with strain amplitudes in a ratio ∣h21∣/∣h22∣ ∼ 0.1–1 under generic orientations of the binary, which could be measured by present detectors for signals with a large signal-to-noise ratio or by third-generation detectors for generic signals should no collapse occur.

<title>A Comparative Study of Two Contrasting Cosmic-Ray Events Caused by Solar Eruptions from NOAA AR 12673 in 2017 September</title>

<div> solar eruptions, AR 12673, Forbush decrease, ground-level enhancement, CMEs <br />
总结: 本研究通过现代仪器持续追踪太阳到地球的太阳耀斑活动和地基宇宙射线探测器，揭示了两次太阳耀斑事件对地球的所有活动链。首次太阳耀斑产生了CME抛射和CME驱动冲击波与地球相交，导致了宇宙射线减少事件。而第二次太阳耀斑的冲击波速度比第一次快得多，尽管第一次事件更好地与地球磁连接，并且耀斑相似，但第二次事件导致了宇宙射线增强事件。结果表明，宇宙射线增强事件的产生可以主要由足够快的CME驱动冲击波主导。 <div>
Two major solar eruptions on AR 12673 produced a Forbush decrease (FD) event (reduction of cosmic rays) on 2017 September 8 and ground-level enhancement (GLE; enhancement of cosmic rays) on 2017 September 10. The occurrence of two contrasting cosmic-ray events within 2 days that are associated with two similar X-class solar flares (X9.3 and X8.2) and share the same active region on the Sun provides us a rare opportunity to understand the dominant factors in determining the properties of transient cosmic-ray events. Using a suite of modern-day instruments continuously tracking solar eruptions from the Sun to the Earth with ground-based cosmic-ray detectors, we reveal the complete cause–effect chain of activities for these two events. We conclude that the different consequences on the ground arise from two effects of the eruptions near the Sun: (1) the geometric effect of CMEs and (2) the intensity effect of CME-driven shocks. The first eruption, which originated at the heliographic longitude of W34° on 2017 September 6, had its CME ejecta and CME-driven shock intercept the Earth, leading to the FD event. The second eruption, which occurred on September 10 at W88°, only had its far flank reach the Earth. The peak shock speed of 3344 km s−1 of the second eruption, much faster than the 2175 km s−1 of the first eruption, is the dominant factor producing the GLE event, even though the first eruption is better connected magnetically to the Earth and has a similar flare. The results indicate that the production of GLE particles can be dominated by fast-enough CME-driven shocks.

<br /><br />总结: 本研究使用TYPHOON长狭缝吸收线光谱技术对NGC 1365的恒星爆发带螺旋星系进行了分析。通过人口综合技术，确定了年龄和金属丰度的空间分布，以及年轻和老年恒星群体的星形成率、泛红、消光和消光与泛红比RV。研究发现恒星盘呈现明显的内外成长特征，年轻恒星群体的亮度分数呈向外增加的趋势，平均年龄减少，质量增长历史在最外层盘完成。年轻恒星群体的金属丰度在较大的星系中心距上呈下降梯度，而老年群体的金属含量则保持稳定。在星系中心区域，年轻群体的金属丰度急剧下降，低于老年群体的水平，这归因于金属贫穷气体的涌入，以及由活跃星系核和超新星反馈引起的星形成中断，并在数十亿年后以早期恒星的恒星风排出的气体再次开始。我们还提供了对后者的支持的简单模型计算。 <div>
We analyze TYPHOON long-slit-absorption line spectra of the starburst barred spiral galaxy NGC 1365 obtained with the Progressive Integral Step Method covering an area of 15 kpc2. Applying a population synthesis technique, we determine the spatial distribution of ages and metallicities of the young and old stellar populations together with star formation rates, reddening, extinction, and the ratio RV of extinction to reddening. We detect a clear indication of inside-out growth of the stellar disk beyond 3 kpc characterized by an outward increasing luminosity fraction of the young stellar population, a decreasing average age, and a history of mass growth, which was finished 2 Gyr later in the outermost disk. The metallicity of the young stellar population is clearly super solar but decreases toward larger galactocentric radii with a gradient of −0.02 dex kpc−1. On the other hand, the metal content of the old population does not show a gradient and stays constant at a level roughly 0.4 dex lower than that of the young population. In the center of NGC 1365, we find a confined region where the metallicity of the young population drops dramatically and becomes lower than that of the old population. We attribute this to the infall of metal-poor gas, and additionally, to interrupted chemical evolution where star formation is stopped by active galactic nuclei and supernova feedback and then after several gigayears resumes with gas ejected by stellar winds from earlier generations of stars. We provide a simple model calculation as support for the latter.

<div> 关键词: 黑洞自旋, 磁化阻滞盘, 磁流体动力学模拟, 星系演化, 引力波 <br />
总结: <br />
本研究关注辐射效率低且几何厚的磁化阻滞盘（MAD），发现MAD可以迅速将黑洞的自旋降低到极低水平。与标准薄亮盘相比，MAD使黑洞的自旋迅速降至0 < aeq ≲ 0.1。这意味着受MAD供应的高超艾登顿速率下快速吸积的黑洞往往会将大部分旋转能量损失到磁化相对论流出。研究还构建了一个半解析的黑洞自旋演化模型，考虑了盘和电磁喷流对黑洞产生的扭矩，并发现aeq的低值既是因为喷流减慢了黑洞自旋，也是因为盘失去了大部分角动量到流出。研究结果对活跃星系和其他系统的黑洞自旋演化以及引力波的演化有重要影响。 <div>
Black hole (BH) spin can play an important role in galaxy evolution by controlling the amount of energy and momentum ejected from near the BH into the surroundings. We focus on radiatively inefficient and geometrically thick magnetically arrested disks (MADs) that can launch strong BH-powered jets. With an appropriately chosen adiabatic index, these systems can describe either the low-luminosity or highly super-Eddington BH accretion regimes. Using a suite of 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we find that for any initial spin, an MAD rapidly spins down the BH to the equilibrium spin of 0 &lt; aeq ≲ 0.1, very low compared to aeq = 1 for the standard thin luminous (Novikov–Thorne) disks. This implies that rapidly accreting (super-Eddington) BHs fed by MADs tend to lose most of their rotational energy to magnetized relativistic outflows. In an MAD, a BH only needs to accrete 20% of its own mass to spin down from a = 1–0.2. We construct a semi-analytic model of BH spin evolution in MADs by taking into account the torques on the BH due to both the hydrodynamic disk and electromagnetic jet components, and find that the low value of aeq is due to both the jets slowing down the BH rotation and the disk losing a large fraction of its angular momentum to outflows. Our results have crucial implications for how BH spins evolve in active galaxies and other systems such as collapsars, where the BH spin-down timescale can be short enough to significantly affect the evolution of gamma-ray emitting BH-powered jets.

Here we explore the impact of all major factors, such as the nonhomogeneous gas distribution, galactic rotation, and gravity, on the observational appearance of superbubbles in nearly face-on spiral galaxies. The results of our 3D numerical simulations are compared to the observed gas column density distribution in the largest southeast superbubble in the late-type spiral galaxy NGC 628. We make use of the star formation history inside the bubble derived from the resolved stellar population seen in Hubble Space Telescope images to obtain its energy and demonstrate that the results of numerical simulations are in good agreement with the observed gas surface density distribution. We also show that the observed gas column density distribution constrains the gaseous disk scale height and the midplane gas density if the energy input rate can be obtained from observations. This implies that observations of large holes in the interstellar gas distribution and their stellar populations have the potential power to solve the midplane gas density–gaseous disk scale height degeneracy problem in nearly face-on galaxies. The possible role of superbubbles in driving the secondary star formation in galaxies is also briefly discussed.

We present the discovery and timing results of four pulsars discovered in a pilot survey at intermediate Galactic latitudes with the Five-hundred Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST). Among these pulsars, two belong to the category of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) with spin periods of less than 20 ms. The other two fall under the classification of “mildly recycled” pulsars, with massive white dwarfs as companions. Remarkably, this small survey, covering an area of 4.7 deg2, led to the discovery of four recycled pulsars. Such success underscores the immense potential of future surveys at intermediate Galactic latitudes. In order to assess the potential yield of MSPs, we conducted population simulations and found that both FAST and Parkes new phased array feed surveys, focusing on intermediate Galactic latitudes, have the capacity to uncover several hundred new MSPs.

总结:<br /><br /> 这篇文章报告了使用Chandra、XMM-Newton、NICER、Swift和NuSTAR测量的PSR J1849−0001脉冲星及其风星云（PWN）的X射线发射特性。我们发现脉冲星的X射线光谱呈现显着的曲率，在约60 keV处达到峰值。通过比较脉冲平均和脉冲内的光谱，我们发现脉冲星的脉冲外发射显示出与脉冲内发射非常相似的光谱形状。利用NuSTAR的脉冲外数据，我们成功测量了PWN的>10 keV光谱和辐射亮度的径向分布，并将这些X射线测量结果与已发表的TeV结果相结合。最后，采用多区域发射场景对广泛的数据进行建模，结果表明PWN内的磁场相对较低（≈7 μG），并且在该PWN内的电子被加速到能量≳400 TeV。负责TeV发射的电子可能会传播到距离脉冲星约30 pc的地方，在大约10 kyr内形成X射线PWN之外的TeV发射云。 <div>
We report on the X-ray emission properties of the pulsar PSR J1849−0001 and its wind nebula (PWN), as measured by Chandra, XMM-Newton, NICER, Swift, and NuSTAR. In the X-ray data, we detected the 38 ms pulsations of the pulsar up to ∼60 keV with high significance. Additionally, we found that the pulsar's on-pulse spectral energy distribution displays significant curvature, peaking at ≈60 keV. Comparing the phase-averaged and on-pulse spectra of the pulsar, we found that the pulsar's off-pulse emission exhibits a spectral shape that is very similar to its on-pulse emission. This characterization of the off-pulse emission enabled us to measure the &gt;10 keV spectrum of the faint and extended PWN using NuSTAR's off-pulse data. We measured both the X-ray spectrum and the radial profiles of the PWN’s brightness and photon index, and we combined these X-ray measurements with published TeV results. We then employed a multizone emission scenario to model the broadband data. The results of the modeling suggest that the magnetic field within the PWN is relatively low (≈7 μG) and that electrons are accelerated to energies ≳400 TeV within this PWN. The electrons responsible for the TeV emission outside the X-ray PWN may propagate to ∼30 pc from the pulsar in ∼10 kyr.

<title>Spectral Hardness and Evolution of Swift Gamma-Ray Bursts and X-Ray Afterglows</title>

<div> 关键词: gamma-ray bursts, spectral hardness, peak energy, X-ray afterglows, magnetar origin
总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了 gamma-ray bursts 的谱硬度特征，使用了峰能量和硬度比两种参数进行分类和分析。研究发现，X 射线的硬度比值普遍低于γ射线。此外，作者还确认了几乎所有观测到的γ射线暴的光谱均可用破裂幂律函数描述，并验证了具有内部X射线高原的暴的磁星起源。另外，作者还指出类型IV暴的光谱受物质喷流几何形状的影响，与其他类型的暴有显著差异。对中性氢吸收对硬度比估计的影响可以忽略不计，尽管它可能会略微降低γ/X射线的亮度。 <div>
Spectral hardness of gamma-ray bursts can be characterized by either hardness ratio or peak energy, and the inconsistency of these parameters can reflect spectral diversity and complexity. We have chosen 310 Swift bursts with well-measured X-ray afterglows to analyze the distributions of their peak energies and hardness ratios before and after absorption of neutral hydrogen. We categorize them into four types according to X-ray temporal patterns and calculate the hardness ratios of both γ-rays and X-rays. It is found that the hardness ratios of X-rays are systematically smaller than those of γ-rays. We also find that both γ-ray hardness ratios and peak energies of bursts of types I, II, and III are identically distributed and are significantly lower than the corresponding measurements of type IV bursts in statistics, which hints that the evolving spectra of type IV bursts are most probably affected by the geometry of outflows. This proves that the influence of neutral hydrogen absorption on the estimation of hardness ratio is negligible even though it can reduce the brightness of γ/X-rays somewhat. Furthermore, we verify that almost all the observed spectra of gamma-ray bursts can be described by a broken power-law function and confirm a magnetar origin for the bursts with internal X-ray plateaus.

通过APEX对G34进行观测，发现了大尺度的、与细丝对齐的速度梯度，驱动了气体向G34中部岭的密集块体内的细丝状气体流入。这些流入是由重力控制的。同时，通过其他线的观测，还确认了MM2、MM4和MM5三个岭的气体内存在块体尺度的气体流入。这些岭的气体流入速率可能取决于大尺度细丝状气体的流入，因为这两个尺度上的流入速率是可比的。总结:
<br />
HMSF是一个多尺度的动态过程，由大尺度的细丝状气体流入驱动，而细丝内部的气体流入现象也得到了确认。整个过程可能受到重力和来自多种来源的湍流的影响。 <div>
There is growing evidence that high-mass star formation (HMSF) is a multiscale, dynamical process in molecular clouds, where filaments transport gas material between larger and smaller scales. We analyze here multiscale gas dynamics in an HMSF filamentary cloud, G034.43+00.24 (G34), using APEX observations of the C18O (2−1), HCO+/H13CO+ (3−2), and HCN/H13CN (3−2) lines. We find large-scale, filament-aligned velocity gradients from C18O emission, which drive filamentary gas inflows onto dense clumps in the middle ridge of G34. The nature of these inflows is gravity driven. We also find clump-scale gas infall in the middle ridge of the MM2, MM4, and MM5 clumps from other lines. Their gas infall rates could depend on large-scale filamentary gas inflows since the infall/inflow rates on these two scales are comparable. We confirm that the multiscale, dynamical HMSF scenario is at work in G34. It could be driven by gravity up to the filament scale, beyond which turbulence originating from several sources, including gravity, could be in effect in G34.

<div> 黑洞，中子星，超Eddington质量转移，高能中微子，超新鲜<br />
总结:
这篇文章讨论了由进化后主序星到黑洞或中子星伴星的超Eddington质量转移所引起的超星云膨胀，以及产生高能中微子的可能机制。研究指出，一些快速无线电暴（FRB）可能由这种短暂的喷射式超Eddington质量转移引擎驱动。根据模型计算，这些超新鲜可能产生的中微子排放量可以解释IceCube观测到的高能中微子弥散背景流的约25％，并且其时间平均中微子谱也与观测到的中微子谱相吻合。此外，这些超新鲜产生的中微子排放可能可延伸至>100 PeV，可以被未来的超高能中微子观测站所探测到。另外，超新鲜内的光学厚度会阻碍GeV–PeV能区的伽马射线逃逸，使得这些中微子源辐射的伽马射线相对较弱，与Fermi对各向同性伽马射线背景的观测结果相符。 <div>
Hypernebulae are inflated by accretion-powered winds accompanying hyper-Eddington mass transfer from an evolved post-main-sequence star onto a black hole or neutron star companion. The ions accelerated at the termination shock—where the collimated fast disk winds and/or jet collide with the slower, wide-angled wind-fed shell—can generate high-energy neutrinos via hadronic proton–proton reactions, and photohadronic (pγ) interactions with the disk thermal and Comptonized nonthermal background photons. It has been suggested that some fast radio bursts (FRBs) may be powered by such short-lived jetted hyper-accreting engines. Although neutrino emission associated with the millisecond duration bursts themselves is challenging to detect, the persistent radio counterparts of some FRB sources—if associated with hypernebulae—could contribute to the high-energy neutrino diffuse background flux. If the hypernebula birth rate follows that of stellar-merger transients and common envelope events, we find that their volume-integrated neutrino emission—depending on the population-averaged mass-transfer rates—could explain up to ∼25% of the high-energy diffuse neutrino flux observed by the IceCube Observatory and the Baikal Gigaton Volume Detector Telescope. The time-averaged neutrino spectrum from hypernebula—depending on the population parameters—can also reproduce the observed diffuse neutrino spectrum. The neutrino emission could in some cases furthermore extend to &gt;100 PeV, detectable by future ultra-high-energy neutrino observatories. The large optical depth through the nebula to Breit–Wheeler (γγ) interaction attenuates the escape of GeV–PeV gamma rays coproduced with the neutrinos, rendering these gamma-ray-faint neutrino sources, consistent with the Fermi observations of the isotropic gamma-ray background.

<div> 关键词: G106.3+2.7, 脉冲星风星云, gamma射线, 磁场, 多波段研究<br />
总结: <br />
G106.3+2.7被认为是一个复合超新星遗迹，具有类似回旋镖形状的脉冲星风星云和无线电波段的两个不同区域（“头”和“尾”）。最近在尾部发现了超高能量的γ射线发射，这表明G106.3+2.7是PeVatron候选星. 通过使用存档的无线电和Chandra数据，以及2020年的新NuSTAR X射线观测结果，我们对脉冲星J2229+6114周围100″范围内的Boomerang PWN进行了全面的多波段研究。 NuSTAR观测结果显示了脉冲星PSR J2229+6114的51.67毫秒自转周期和PWN辐射的能量谱，该辐射呈幂律模型，Γ值为1.52±0.06，直到20keV。与Kothes等人以前的无线电研究不同，根据（1）过去20年来X射线流量的稳定性，（2）脉冲星风星云的能量依赖性X射线尺寸和（3）多波段光谱能谱数据，我们更倾向于较低的PWN磁场（B∼3μG）和较大的距离（d∼8kpc）。我们的光谱能谱模型表明，脉冲星风星云目前正在被超新星逆冲击压缩，大约在1000年前被压缩。在这种情况下，头部区域应该是由早期被脉冲星注入的GeV-TeV电子形成，这些电子正在向低密度环境传播。 <div>
G106.3+2.7, commonly considered to be a composite supernova remnant (SNR), is characterized by a boomerang-shaped pulsar wind nebula (PWN) and two distinct (“head” and “tail”) regions in the radio band. A discovery of very-high-energy gamma-ray emission (Eγ &gt; 100 GeV) followed by the recent detection of ultrahigh-energy gamma-ray emission (Eγ &gt; 100 TeV) from the tail region suggests that G106.3+2.7 is a PeVatron candidate. We present a comprehensive multiwavelength study of the Boomerang PWN (100″ around PSR J2229+6114) using archival radio and Chandra data obtained two decades ago, a new NuSTAR X-ray observation from 2020, and upper limits on gamma-ray fluxes obtained by Fermi-LAT and VERITAS observatories. The NuSTAR observation allowed us to detect a 51.67 ms spin period from the pulsar PSR J2229+6114 and the PWN emission characterized by a power-law model with Γ = 1.52 ± 0.06 up to 20 keV. Contrary to the previous radio study by Kothes et al., we prefer a much lower PWN B-field (B ∼ 3 μG) and larger distance (d ∼ 8 kpc) based on (1) the nonvarying X-ray flux over the last two decades, (2) the energy-dependent X-ray size of the PWN resulting from synchrotron burn-off, and (3) the multiwavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) data. Our SED model suggests that the PWN is currently re-expanding after being compressed by the SNR reverse shock ∼1000 yr ago. In this case, the head region should be formed by GeV–TeV electrons injected earlier by the pulsar propagating into the low-density environment.

We present the stellar mass–stellar metallicity relation for 3491 star-forming galaxies at 2 ≲ z ≲ 3 using rest-frame far-ultraviolet spectra from the Lyα Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS). We fit stellar population synthesis models from the Binary Population And Spectral Synthesis code (v2.2.1) to medium-resolution (R ∼ 1000) and high signal-to-noise (&gt;30 per 100 km s−1 over the wavelength range 1221–1800 Å) composite spectra of galaxies in bins of stellar mass to determine their stellar metallicity, primarily tracing Fe/H. We find a strong correlation between stellar mass and stellar metallicity, with stellar metallicity monotonically increasing with stellar mass at low masses and flattening at high masses (M* ≳ 1010.3M⊙). Additionally, we compare our stellar metallicity measurements with the gas-phase oxygen abundance of galaxies at similar redshift and estimate the average [α/Fe] ∼ 0.6. Such high α-enhancement indicates that high-redshift galaxies have not yet undergone significant iron enrichment through Type Ia supernovae. Moreover, we utilize an analytic chemical evolution model to constrain the mass loading parameter of galactic winds as a function of stellar mass. We find that as the stellar mass increases, the mass loading parameter decreases. The parameter then flattens or reaches a turning point at around M* ∼ 1010.5M⊙. Our findings may signal the onset of black-hole-driven outflows at z ∼ 2.5 for galaxies with M* ≳ 1010.5 M⊙.

<div> Hubble Space Telescope, ground-based surveys, progenitor detection, Legacy Survey of Space and Time, supernova

总结:<br />
本文探讨了使用地面广域调查数据来增加核心坍缩超新星（SN）前体星探测率的可能性。研究发现，通过结合前SN和晚期图像来搜索前体星的消失可以提高检测率。通过对ZTF数据进行搜索验证了这一概念。然后，通过模拟近距离SN的种群估算了Vera C. Rubin望远镜的LSST的前体探测率。研究还指出，亮宿主星系的背景会降低LSST灵敏度，预计在10年的调查中将检测到大约50个红超巨前体星和数个黄色和蓝色超巨前体星。此外，预计还将检测数百个前SN暴发。 <div>
The direct detection of core-collapse supernova (SN) progenitor stars is a powerful way of probing the last stages of stellar evolution. However, detections in archival Hubble Space Telescope images are limited to about one detection per year. Here, we explore whether we can increase the detection rate by using data from ground-based wide-field surveys. Due to crowding and atmospheric blurring, progenitor stars can typically not be identified in preexplosion images alone. Instead, we combine many pre-SN and late-time images to search for the disappearance of the progenitor star. As a proof of concept, we implement our search of ZTF data. For a few hundred images, we achieve limiting magnitudes of ∼23 mag in the g and r bands. However, no progenitor stars or long-lived outbursts are detected for 29 SNe within z ≤ 0.01, and the ZTF limits are typically several magnitudes less constraining than detected progenitors in the literature. Next, we estimate progenitor detection rates for the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) with the Vera C. Rubin telescope by simulating a population of nearby SNe. The background from bright host galaxies reduces the nominal LSST sensitivity by, on average, 0.4 mag. Over the 10 yr survey, we expect the detection of ∼50 red supergiant progenitors and several yellow and blue supergiants. The progenitors of Type Ib and Ic SNe will be detectable if they are brighter than −4.7 or −4.0 mag in the LSST i band, respectively. In addition, we expect the detection of hundreds of pre-SN outbursts depending on their brightness and duration.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章研究了DECaLS剪切目录中的不同参数与斯隆数字化天文巡天中心星系的哈洛质量（Mh）之间的关系。结果表明，这些参数与Mh存在强烈的正相关关系，其中包括星际质量（M*）、星等离散度（σ*）、丰度匹配哈洛质量（MAM）和卫星速度离散度（σs）。Mh-M*和Mh-σ*的关系与星系团的丰度密切相关，而Mh-MAM和Mh-σs的关系则独立于此。研究还表明，σs是其中最佳的代理参数。此外，通过组合M*、σ*和MAM构建新的代理参数，可以最小化对丰度密度和星际发射率的依赖。最后，研究还探讨了Mh-超大质量黑洞（SMBH）质量的关系，并发现了SMBH快速线性生长阶段的迹象。同时发现Mh、M*和σ*之间的关联随着M*的变化而变化，表明不同的过程推动了星系和SMBH在不同阶段的生长。 <div>
Based on the DECaLS shear catalog, we study the scaling relations between halo mass (Mh) and various proxies for Sloan Digital Sky Survey central galaxies, including stellar mass (M*), stellar velocity dispersion (σ*), abundance-matching halo mass (MAM), and satellite velocity dispersion (σs), and their dependencies on galaxy and group properties. In general, these proxies all have strong positive correlations with Mh, consistent with previous studies. We find that the Mh–M* and Mh–σ* relations depend strongly on group richness (Nsat), while the Mh–MAM and Mh–σs relations are independent of it. Moreover, the dependence on the star formation rate (SFR) is rather weak in the Mh–σ* and Mh–σs relations, but very prominent in the other two. σs is thus the best proxy among them, and its scaling relation is in good agreement with hydrodynamical simulations. However, estimating σs accurately for individual groups/clusters is challenging because of interlopers and the requirement for sufficient satellites. We construct new proxies by combining M*, σ*, and MAM, and find that the proxy with 30% contribution from MAM and 70% from σ* can minimize the dependence on Nsat and the SFR. We obtain the Mh–supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass relation via the SMBH scaling relation and find indications for rapid and linear growth phases for the SMBH. We also find that correlations among Mh, M*, and σ* change with M*, indicating that different processes drive the growth of galaxies and SMBHs at different stages.

<div> 关键词: 核心坍缩超新星，双峰射电光度曲线，环绕恒星介质，同步辐射，快速冷却

总结:
核心坍缩超新星（CCSNe）的一些案例显示在爆炸几年内的双峰射电光度曲线。研究人员提出了一种新的机制来解释这种现象，即在同步辐射光谱能量分布的进化模型中引入快速和慢速冷却阶段，从而在观测频率下系统变得对同步辐射自吸收。当快速冷却转变为慢速冷却阶段时，射电光度曲线就会呈现双峰特征。研究人员还提出SN 2007bg作为这种双峰射电超新星的特例，并建议该模型可能成为评估超新星中电子加速特性的潜在手段。  <br /><br /> <div>
It is recognized that some core-collapse supernovae (SNe) show a double-peaked radio light curve within a few years since the explosion. A shell of circumstellar medium (CSM) detached from the SN progenitor has been considered to play a viable role in characterizing such a rebrightening of radio emission. Here, we propose another mechanism that can give rise to the double-peaked radio light curve in core-collapse SNe. The key ingredient in the present work is to expand the model for the evolution of the synchrotron spectral energy distribution (SED) to a generic form, including fast and slow cooling regimes, as guided by the widely accepted modeling scheme of gamma-ray burst afterglows. We show that even without introducing an additional CSM shell, the radio light curve would show a double-peaked morphology when the system becomes optically thin to synchrotron self-absorption at the observational frequency during the fast cooling regime. We can observe this double-peaked feature if the transition from the fast cooling to slow cooling regime occurs during the typical observational timescale of SNe. This situation is realized when the minimum Lorentz factor of injected electrons is initially large enough for the nonthermal electrons’ SED to be discrete from the thermal distribution. We propose SN 2007bg as a special case of double-peaked radio SNe that can be possibly explained by the presented scenario. Our model can serve as a potential diagnostic for electron acceleration properties in SNe.

<br /><br />总结:
TDEs在后星爆星系中过度表示，通过重新审视TDE率并考虑AGN盘的演变，发现TDE率在AGN转为非活跃阶段时会显著增强约2个数量级，这提供了对于TDE在后星爆星系中过度表示的解释。 <div>
Tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide a valuable probe for studying the dynamics of stars in the nuclear environments of galaxies. Recent observations show that TDEs are strongly overrepresented in post-starburst or “green valley” galaxies, although the underlying physical mechanism remains unclear. Considering the possible interaction between stars and active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks, the TDE rates can be greatly changed compared to those in quiescent galactic nuclei. In this work, we revisit TDE rates by incorporating an evolving AGN disk within the framework of “loss cone” theory. We numerically evolve the Fokker–Planck equations by considering star–disk interactions, in situ star formation in the unstable region of the outer AGN disk, and evolution of the accretion process of supermassive black holes. We find that the TDE rates are enhanced by about 2 orders of magnitude shortly after the AGN transitions into an inactive stage. During this phase, the accumulated stars rapidly scatter into the loss cone due to the disappearance of the inner standard thin disk. Our results provide an explanation for the overrepresentation of TDEs in post-starburst galaxies.

Recent observations of Her X-1 with NuSTAR (as well as with INTEGRAL, Swift, and Astrosat) have provided evidence that the nearly 20 yr-long decay of the cyclotron line energy since ∼1994 has ended and that a stable value has replaced the decay. Using the observations of the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) performed between 2017 July and 2020 February, we analyze the spectra of Her X-1 in its main-on state, focusing on tracing the evolution of cyclotron line energy. While our analysis of eight main-on observations with Insight-HXMT (two in coordination with NuSTAR) shows significant differences with the results of NuSTAR, two earlier findings are confirmed: the positive correlation between the cyclotron line energy and the X-ray flux (source luminosity) and the constancy of the flux-normalized cyclotron line energy during 2017–2020—albeit with significant uncertainty about the absolute value.

The full disk, full of gas and dust, determines the upper limit of planet masses, and its lifetime is critical for planet formation, especially for giant planets.

Combined with Gaia EDR3, Two Micron All Sky Survey, and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer data, 1077 disk-bearing TTS candidates were found in LAMOST DR8, and stellar parameters were obtained. Among them, 783 are newly classified by spectra as classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs; 169) or weak-lined T Tauri stars (WTTSs). Based on EW and FWHM of Hα, 157 TTSs in accretion were identified, with ∼82% also having full disks. For TTSs with M &lt; 0.35M☉, about 80% seem to already lose their full disks at ∼0.1 Myr, which may explain their lower mass, while the remaining 20% with full disks evolve at similar rates of non-full disks within 5 Myr, allowing enough time and material to form giant planets. The fraction of accreting TTSs to disk-bearing TTSs is stable at ∼10% and can last ∼5–10 Myr, suggesting that full disks and accretion evolve with similar rates as non-full disks. For TTSs with M &gt; 0.35 M☉, almost all full disks can survive more than 0.1 Myr, most for 1 Myr and some even for 20 Myr. For TTSs with M &gt; 0.35 M☉, almost all full disks can survive more than 0.1 Myr, most for 1 Myr, and some even for 20 Myr, which implies planets are more likely to be formed in their disks than those of M &lt; 0.35 M☉, and thus M dwarfs with M &gt; 0.35 M☉ can have more planets. The fraction of full-disk TTSs to disk-bearing TTSs decreases with age following the relation f ∝ t−0.35, and similar relations existed in the fraction of accreting TTSs and the fraction of full-disk CTTSs, suggesting faster full disks and accretion evolution than non-full disks. For full-disk stars, the ratio of accretion of lower-mass stars is systematically lower than that of higher-mass stars, confirming the dependence of accretion on stellar mass, which may be reflective of an observational bias in the detection of accretion levels, with the lower-mass stars crossing below the detection threshold earlier than higher-mass stars.

Supermassive primordial stars with masses exceeding ∼105M⊙ that form in atomically cooled halos are the leading candidates for the origin of high-redshift quasars at z &gt; 6. Recent numerical simulations, however, find that multiple accretion disks can form within a halo, each of which can potentially host a supermassive star. We investigate the formation and evolution of secondary supermassive stars in atomically cooled halos, including strong variations in their accretion histories driven by gravitational interactions between their disks and those surrounding the primary supermassive stars in each halo. We find that all secondary disks produce long-lived supermassive stars under sustained rapid accretion. We also find, however, that the majority of secondary supermassive stars do undergo at least one protracted quiescent accretion phase, during which time they thermally relax and may become powerful sources of ionizing feedback. In many halos, the two satellite disks collide, suggesting that the two stars can come into close proximity. This may induce additional mass exchange between them, leading to a great diversity of possible outcomes. These range from coevolution as main-sequence stars to main sequence—black hole pairs and black hole—black hole mergers. We discuss the likely outcome for these binary interactions based on the evolutionary state of both supermassive stars at the end of our simulations, as well as prospects for their future detection by current and next-generation facilities.

Measuring the coverage of dark spots on cool stars is important to understanding how stellar magnetic activity scales with the rotation rate and convection zone depth. In this respect, it is crucial to infer surface magnetic patterns on G and K stars, to reveal solar-like stellar dynamos in action. Molecular bands serve as invaluable indicators of cool spots on the surfaces of stars, as they play a crucial role in enabling accurate assessments of the extent of spot coverage across the stellar surface. Therefore, more reliable surface images can be obtained considering the inversion of atomic lines with molecular bands. In this context, we simultaneously carry out Doppler imaging (DI) using atomic lines as well as titanium oxide band profiles of PW And (K2 V) and also investigate chromospheric activity indicators for the first time in the literature, using high-resolution spectra. The surface spot distribution obtained from the inversion process represents both atomic line and TiO-band profiles quite accurately. The chromospheric emission is also correlated with photospheric spot coverage, except during a possible flare event during the observations. We detect frequent flare activity, using TESS photometry. We also introduce a new open-source, Python-based DI code SpotDIPy that allows performing surface reconstructions of single stars using the maximum entropy method. We test the code by comparing surface reconstruction simulations with the extensively used DoTS code. We show that the surface brightness distribution maps reconstructed via both codes using the same simulated data are consistent with each other.

总结:
该研究探讨了高斯过程（GPs）作为一种机器学习算法在重建哈勃参数H(z)方面的前景，考虑了即将到来的引力波观测任务eLISA和Einstein Telescope。研究假设了各种宇宙学背景模型，并利用实际生成的目录，非参数地利用GPs重建了Hubble参数。研究重点讨论了早期和晚期先验对H(z)重建的影响，进而对哈勃常数（H0）的影响。分析表明，GPs在特定任务的观测窗口内对宇宙膨胀历史的重建是相当稳健的。该研究进一步证实，eLISA和ET都能够提供对H(z)和H0的约束，这些约束与当前数据集的推断相竞争。特别地，研究发现，eLISA大约持续10年，观测到大约80个明亮的引力波事件时，将能够像大约持续3年的ET运行观测大约1000个明亮的引力波事件一样准确地约束H0。预计，在更长的eLISA任务持续时间（例如大约15年，有大约120个事件）内，精确度会有进一步提高。最后，针对每个模型，讨论了这些未来的引力波观测任务在解决哈勃张力中可能发挥的作用。 <br /><br /> <div>
We study the prospects of Gaussian processes (GPs), a machine-learning (ML) algorithm, as a tool to reconstruct the Hubble parameter H(z) with two upcoming gravitational-wave (GW) missions, namely, the evolved Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (eLISA) and the Einstein Telescope (ET). Assuming various background cosmological models, the Hubble parameter has been reconstructed in a nonparametric manner with the help of a GP using realistically generated catalogs for each mission. The effects of early-time and late-time priors on the reconstruction of H(z), and hence on the Hubble constant (H0), have also been focused on separately. Our analysis reveals that a GP is quite robust in reconstructing the expansion history of the Universe within the observational window of the specific missions under consideration. We further confirm that both eLISA and ET would be able to provide constraints on H(z) and H0, which would be competitive to those inferred from current data sets. In particular, we observe that an eLISA run of a ∼10 yr duration with ∼80 detected bright siren events would be able to constrain H0 as precisely as a ∼3 yr ET run assuming ∼1000 bright siren event detections. Further improvement in precision is expected for longer eLISA mission durations such as a ∼15 yr time frame having ∼120 events. Lastly, we discuss the possible role of these future GW missions in addressing the Hubble tension, for each model, on a case-by-case basis.

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章主要介绍了M矮星的活动随时间的演化，特别关注了它们的磁活动以及X-UV辐射，这对于研究外层大气和宿主外行星的适居性至关重要。研究发现M矮星的活动会随着时间而有所下降，这可能成为确定M矮星年龄的重要因素。文章还讨论了M矮星活动与外行星大气流失机制的关联以及不同的磁活动机制。 <div>
The vast majority of stars in the nearby stellar neighborhood are M dwarfs. Their low masses and luminosities result in slow rates of nuclear evolution and minimal changes to the stars’ observable properties, even along astronomical timescales. However, they possess relatively powerful magnetic dynamos and resulting X-ray to UV (X–UV) activity, compared to their bolometric luminosities. This magnetic activity does undergo an observable decline over time, potentially making it a key age determinant for M dwarfs. Observing this activity is important for studying the outer atmospheres of these stars, but also for comparing the behaviors of different spectral type subsets of M dwarfs; e.g., those with partially versus fully convective interiors. Beyond stellar astrophysics, understanding the X–UV activity of M dwarfs over time is a key component when studying the atmospheres and habitability of any hosted exoplanets. Earth-sized exoplanets, in particular, are more commonly found orbiting M dwarfs than any other stellar type, and thermal escape (driven by the M dwarf X–UV activity) is believed to be the dominant atmospheric loss mechanism for these planets. Utilizing recently calibrated M dwarf age–rotation relationships, also constructed as part of the Living with a Red Dwarf program, we have analyzed the evolution of M dwarf activity over time, in terms of coronal (X-ray), chromospheric (Lyα, and Ca ii), and overall X–UV (5–1700 Å) emissions. The activity–age relationships presented here will be useful for studying exoplanet habitability and atmospheric loss, and also for studying the different dynamo and outer atmospheric heating mechanisms at work in M dwarfs.

光学光度曲线的早期阶段受到汤姆逊散射和超新星喷射物中的化学混合的影响。研究发现，考虑汤姆逊散射会导致光度峰值明显降低，并且初期光学光度曲线出现了持续几天的平台特征。此外，化学混合对模拟结果和观测数据之间的差异也起到了重要作用，表明简单的方法可能会引入很大的不确定性。总结:光学光度曲线受汤姆逊散射和化学混合的影响；汤姆逊散射降低了光度峰值；模拟结果出现了持续几天的平台特征；化学混合对模拟结果和观测数据之间的差异起到了重要作用。 <div>
Previous numerical simulations of double-peaked Type IIb supernova (SN IIb) light curves have demonstrated that the radius and mass of the hydrogen-rich envelope of the progenitor star can significantly influence the brightness and timescale of the early-time light curve around the first peak. In this study, we investigate how Thomson scattering and chemical mixing in the SN ejecta affect the optical light curves during the early stages of the SNe IIb using radiation hydrodynamics simulations. By comparing the results from two different numerical codes (i.e., STELLA and SNEC), we find that the optical brightness of the first peak can be reduced by more than a factor of 3 as a result of the effect of Thomson scattering that causes the thermalization depth to be located below the Rosseland mean photosphere, compared to the corresponding case where this effect is ignored. We also observe a short-lived plateau-like feature lasting for a few days in the early-time optical light curves of our models, in contrast to typical observed SNe IIb that show a quasi-linear decrease in optical magnitudes after the first peak. A significant degree of chemical mixing between the hydrogen-rich envelope and the helium core in SN ejecta is required to reconcile this discrepancy between the model prediction and observation. Meanwhile, to properly reproduce the first peak, a significant mixing of 56Ni into the hydrogen-rich outermost layers should be restricted. Our findings indicate that inferring the SN IIb progenitor structure from a simplified approach that ignores these two factors may introduce substantial uncertainty.

内部重力波在低频极限下自然是伪不可压缩的。在这种极限下, 一些anelastic近似形式无法正确再现内部重力波的行为。伪不可压缩近似假设压力的波动在连续方程中很小，而在非绝热层，这两种近似方法是相同的，但在稳定层中，它们之间的差异很大，只有伪不可压缩近似仍然有效。 <br /><br />总结: 内部重力波在低频极限下是伪不可压缩的，伪不可压缩近似假设压力的波动很小，适用于稳定层。与非绝热层的区别。 <div>
Starting from the fully compressible fluid equations in a plane-parallel atmosphere, we demonstrate that linear internal gravity waves are naturally pseudo-incompressible in the limit that the wave frequency ω is much less than that of surface gravity waves, i.e., \omega \ll \sqrt{{{gk}}_{h}}, where g is the gravitational acceleration and kh is the horizontal wavenumber. We accomplish this by performing a formal expansion of the wave functions and the local dispersion relation in terms of a dimensionless frequency \varepsilon =\omega /\sqrt{{{gk}}_{h}}. Further, we show that, in this same low-frequency limit, several forms of the anelastic approximation, including the Lantz–Braginsky–Roberts formulation, poorly reproduce the correct behavior of internal gravity waves. The pseudo-incompressible approximation is achieved by assuming that Eulerian fluctuations of the pressure are small in the continuity equation—whereas, in the anelastic approximation, Eulerian density fluctuations are ignored. In an adiabatic stratification, such as occurs in a convection zone, the two approximations become identical. However, in a stable stratification, the differences between the two approximations are stark and only the pseudo-incompressible approximation remains valid.

总结：<br /><br />这篇论文利用JWST/NIRSpec采集的光谱数据独立确认了16个红移为z=8.61-11.40的星系，并且发现了一个z=4.91的明亮干扰物。结合文献中的其他9个星系，共确认了25个星系，使用这些数据得出了紫外光度函数的确定性和下限，显示出对z∼12有轻微的红移演化。同时也得出了宇宙星系形成率密度的下限，证实了z∼12存在高星系形成率密度，支持了之前的光度研究结果。此外，作者还提出了一些观测策略，以有效地排除未来JWST项目中的低红移干扰因素。 <div>
We present pure spectroscopic constraints on the UV luminosity functions and cosmic star formation rate (SFR) densities from 25 galaxies at zspec = 8.61–13.20. By reducing the JWST/NIRSpec spectra taken in multiple programs of Early Release Observation, Early Release Science, General Observer, and Director’s Discretionary Time observations with our analysis technique, we independently confirm 16 galaxies at zspec = 8.61–11.40, including new redshift determinations, and a bright interloper at zspec = 4.91 that was claimed as a photometric candidate at z ∼ 16. In conjunction with nine galaxies at redshifts up to zspec = 13.20 in the literature, we make a sample of 25 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies in total and carefully derive the best estimates and lower limits of the UV luminosity functions. These UV luminosity function constraints are consistent with the previous photometric estimates within the uncertainties and indicate mild redshift evolution toward z ∼ 12, showing tensions with some theoretical models of rapid evolution. With these spectroscopic constraints, we obtain firm lower limits of the cosmic SFR densities and spectroscopically confirm a high SFR density at z ∼ 12 beyond the constant star formation efficiency models, which supports earlier claims from the photometric studies. While there are no spectroscopically confirmed galaxies with very large stellar masses violating the ΛCDM model due to the removal of the bright interloper, we confirm star-forming galaxies at zspec = 11–13 with stellar masses much higher than model predictions. Our results indicate possibilities of high star formation efficiency (&gt;5%), a hidden active galactic nucleus, a top-heavy initial mass function (possibly with Population III), and large scatter/variance. Having these successful and unsuccessful spectroscopy results, we suggest observational strategies for efficiently removing low-redshift interlopers for future JWST programs.

<br /><br />总结:
本文研究了通过引力波发射检测到的二进制黑洞系统，提出了一种基于核密度估计的自洽迭代方法来估计完整的二进制质量分布。研究发现，主要质量具有与以前调查一致的局部极大值，而次要质量分布具有部分独立的结构，并且与幂律和常数函数的q不一致。与大多数先前的调查不同，我们发现次要质量对几乎相等质量的二进制的偏好较小；相反，次要质量在略低于主要质量的地方具有自己的“光谱线”，并且我们观察到在∼10 M⊙峰值附近的主要和次要质量之间的反相关。 <div>
Binary black hole (BBH) systems detected via gravitational-wave emission are a recently opened astrophysical frontier with many unknowns and uncertainties. Accurate reconstruction of the binary distribution with as few assumptions as possible is desirable for inference of formation channels and environments. Most population analyses have, though, assumed a power law in binary mass ratio q, and/or assumed a universal q distribution regardless of primary mass. Methods based on kernel density estimation allow us to dispense with such assumptions and directly estimate the joint binary mass distribution. We deploy a self-consistent iterative method to estimate this full BBH mass distribution, finding local maxima in primary mass consistent with previous investigations and a secondary mass distribution with a partly independent structure, inconsistent both with a power law and with a constant function of q. We find a weaker preference for near-equal-mass binaries than in most previous investigations; instead, the secondary mass has its own “spectral lines” at slightly lower values than the primary, and we observe an anticorrelation between primary and secondary masses around the ∼10 M⊙ peak.
