The Sun is depleted in refractory elements compared to nearby solar twins, which may be linked to the formation of giant or terrestrial planets. Here we present high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectroscopic data for 17 solar-like stars hosting planets, obtained with Magellan II/MIKE, to investigate whether this depletion is related to planet formation. We derive stellar parameters, including stellar atmosphere, age, radius, mass, and chemical abundances for 22 elements from carbon to europium through line-by-line differential analysis. Our uncertainties range from 0.01 dex for Fe and Si to 0.08 dex for Sr, Y, and Eu. By comparing the solar abundances to those of the 17 stars, we investigate the differential abundance ([X/Fe]solar–[X/Fe]star) versus condensation temperature (Tc) trend. In particular, we apply Galactic chemical evolution corrections to five solar twins within the full sample. Our results conform to previous studies that the Sun is relatively depleted in refractory compared to volatile elements. For both five solar twins and the rest of the solar-like stars, we find that all stars hosting known gas giant planets exhibit negative Tc trend slopes, suggesting that the Sun is relatively depleted in refractory elements compared to similar giant planet-hosting stars. Additionally, we find no correlation between Tc trend slopes and the total mass of detected terrestrial planets in each system, suggesting that terrestrial planet formation may not be the cause of refractory element depletion in the Sun.

<title>Effects of Subhalos on Interpreting Highly Magnified Sources Near Lensing Caustics</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada76a</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Large magnification factors near gravitational lensing caustics of galaxy-cluster lenses allow the study of individual stars or compact stellar associations at cosmological distances. We study how the presence of sub-galactic subhalos, an inevitable consequence of cold dark matter, can alter the property of caustics and hence change the interpretation of highly magnified sources that lie atop them. First, we consider a galaxy-cluster halo populated with subhalos sampled from a realistic subhalo mass function calibrated to N-body simulations. Then, we compare a semianalytical approximation and an adaptive ray-shooting method that we employ to quantify the property of the caustics. As a case study, we investigate Earendel, a z = 6.2 candidate of magnified single- or multiple-star system with a lone lensed image atop the critical curve in the Sunrise Arc. We find that the source size constraint (≲0.3 pc) previously derived from macrolens models should be relaxed by a factor of a few to 10 when subhalos are accounted for, therefore allowing the possibility of a compact star cluster. The subhalos could introduce an astrometric perturbation that is ≲0 5, which does not contradict observation. These conclusions are largely robust to changes in the subhalo population. Subhalos therefore should be seriously accounted for when interpreting the astrophysical nature of similar highly magnified sources uncovered in recent high-z observations.

<title>Revisiting the Fundamental Planes of Black Hole Activity for Strong Jet Sources</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Whether the X-ray emissions of strong jet sources originate from disk+coronas or jets is still controversial. In this work, we constructed a strong jet sample containing 50 flat-spectrum radio quasars, 51 low-synchrotron-peaked BL Lac objects, and 18 intermediate-synchrotron-peaked BL Lac objects to explore the origin of X-ray emissions. Generally, blazars are the typical radio-loud active galactic nucleus with a powerful jet toward the observer, causing their broadband emissions to be boosted. By considering the Doppler boosting effect, we obtain the intrinsic radio–X-ray correlation and the fundamental plane (FP) of black hole activity for the strong jet sources: the intrinsic radio–X-ray correlation is , which favor the jet-dominated mode; the intrinsic FP is , which can be interpreted by the hybrid mode of jet+standard disk. Our results suggest that the X-ray emissions of strong jet sources are dominated by the jets, but there may also be a small contribution from the disk. In addition, the radio–X-ray correlation and FP of strong jet sources do not have a significant dependence on the Eddington-ratio.

<title>Starburst Galaxies in Their Last Billion Years: An Hδ Absorption Line Selected Sample</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada3bf</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada3bf</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this paper, we focus on the study of starburst galaxies in their final billion years. Our galaxy selection is based solely on the presence of the Hδ absorption line, which permits the later evolution of starburst galaxies to be traced, coinciding with the emergence of A-type stars in these galaxies. We propose a novel method that utilizes star formation rate and UVJ colors to classify galaxies in the sample, and use the spectral features to mark their stages of evolution. Our in-depth analysis of the Mg ii line indicates the substantial increase in the number of F- and G-type stars when a galaxy evolves from star-forming to quiescent phase. Furthermore, we identify active galactic nuclei in this sample to explore their roles in the later stage of the star formation history of galaxies.

<title>Equatorial Enhancement in the Dustiest OH/IR Stars in the Galactic Bulge</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada6ad</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have detected the 10 μm silicate feature and the 11.3 μm crystalline forsterite feature in absorption in 21 oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch stars in the Galactic bulge. The depths of the 10 μm feature indicate highly obscured circumstellar environments. The additional crystalline features may suggest either an extended envelope or dust formation in a high-density environment. We have also modeled the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the sample using radiative transfer models, and compared the results to wind speeds measured using 1612 MHz circumstellar OH masers, as well as previous estimates of circumstellar properties. The 16 sources with measured pulsation periods appear on sequence D of the mid-IR period–luminosity relation, associated with the long secondary period. We suspect that all of these sources are in fact fundamental-mode pulsators. At least two sources appear on the fundamental-mode sequence when accounting for the dust content. For the remainder, these sources are also likely fundamental-mode pulsators with extended envelopes. Taken as a whole, the high optical depths, crystalline features, discrepancies between observed and modeled wind speeds, pulsation periods longer than other fundamental-mode pulsators, and SED and pulsation properties similar to those with known equatorially enhanced circumstellar envelopes (e.g., OH 26.5+0.6 and OH 30.1–0.7) lead us to believe that these sources are likely to be equatorially enhanced.

<title>Modeling the Impact of Moderate External UV Irradiation on Disk Chemistry</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada939</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada939</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The chemistry within a protoplanetary disk is greatly affected by external radiation from the local stellar environment. Previous work has focused on extreme radiation fields, representative of the center of something like the Orion Nebula Cluster. However, even in such environments, many disks exist at the edges of a cluster where the lower stellar density leads to radiation fields weaker by orders of magnitude compared to the center. We present new chemical models of a T Tauri disk in the presence of a moderately increased interstellar radiation field (ISRF). Such an environment has a background UV strength 10–100 times higher than the galactic average ISRF. Moderate radiation fields are among the most prevalent disk-harboring environments and have interesting implications for the chemistry of the outer disk radii. We find that the external UV radiation creates an outer ionization front that impacts the cold disk chemistry to varying degrees, depending on outer disk structure. Certain molecules like C+, N2H+, C, and CS are more strongly impacted by the ISRF in their abundance, column density, and observable emission. Other abundant species like HCO+ and CO are less affected by the external UV flux in the outer disk under such moderate UV conditions. Further, we demonstrate that the chemistry occurring in the inner tens of au is relatively unchanged, which suggests that even in moderately externally irradiated disks the inner disk chemistry may be more similar to isolated disks like those in, e.g., the Taurus and Lupus star-forming regions.

<title>Constraints on Cosmic-Ray Acceleration in Bright Gamma-Ray Bursts with Observations of Fermi</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada941</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are widely suggested as potential sources of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays. The kinetic energy of the jets dissipates, leading to the production of an enormous amount of gamma-ray photons and possibly also the acceleration of protons. The accelerated protons will interact with the radiation of the GRB via the photomeson and Bethe–Heitler processes, which can initiate electromagnetic cascades. This process can give rise to broadband radiation up to the GeV–TeV gamma-ray regime. The expected gamma-ray flux from cascades depends on the properties of the GRB jet, such as the dissipation radius Rdiss, the bulk Lorentz factor Γ, and the baryon loading factor ηp. Therefore, observations of Fermi-LAT can impose constraints on these important parameters. In this study, we select 12 GRBs of high keV–MeV fluence and constrain the baryon loading factor, under different combinations of the bulk Lorentz factor and the dissipation radius based on Fermi-LAT's measurements. Our findings indicate a strong constraint of ηp < 10 for most selected GRBs over a large parameter space except for large dissipation radii (≳1015 cm) and high bulk Lorentz factors (≳600). The constraint is comparable to, and in some GRBs even stronger than, that from high-energy neutrinos for stacked GRBs. Our results suggest that for a typical bulk Lorentz factor of several hundred, the dissipation radii of GRBs need to be large to avoid overshooting the GeV gamma-ray flux during the prompt emission phase of GRBs, which can be used to constrain GRBs.

<title>A Study of Cosmological Models Based on the Long Gamma-Ray Burst Duration Histogram</title>

The duration of more than one thousand gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) was measured by using the Swift satellite. Besides the redshift distribution of GRBs, the burst duration is another significant property of GRBs that can be analyzed. In this paper, we first find the detection rate of Swift/Burst Alert Telescope for a cosmological model with the ωCDM model. Then, by performing a Monte Carlo simulation, we find the "long" GRB duration histogram to compare the cosmological model with the ωCDM model and the ΛCDM model. The χ2 minimization method is employed to determine the optimal value of α in the dark energy equation of state, P = cω(z)ρ, with ω(z) = −1 + α z. We show that for the ωCDM model, all values of α within α = [0, 0.16] range are considered acceptable within two standard deviations.

<title>Insights into Galaxy Evolution from Interpretable Sparse Feature Networks</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adadec</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Galaxy appearances reveal the physics of how they formed and evolved. Machine learning (ML) models can now exploit galaxies’ information-rich morphologies to predict physical properties directly from image cutouts. Learning the relationship between pixel-level features and galaxy properties is essential for building a physical understanding of galaxy evolution, but we are still unable to explicate the details of how deep neural networks represent image features. To address this lack of interpretability, we present a novel neural network architecture called a Sparse Feature Network (SFNet). SFNets produce interpretable features that can be linearly combined in order to estimate galaxy properties like optical emission line ratios or gas-phase metallicity. We find that SFNets do not sacrifice accuracy in order to gain interpretability, and that they perform comparably well to cutting-edge models on astronomical ML tasks. Our novel approach is valuable for finding physical patterns in large data sets and helping astronomers interpret ML results.

<title>The Impact of Particle Drifts on the Flux of High-energy Solar Protons and He Ions Arriving at Earth from Compact Solar Sources</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adadf8</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adadf8</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a numerical model to investigate the role of the ion mass-charge ratio (m/q) in determining the flux of MeV–GeV solar energetic particles (SEPs), released impulsively from a compact source near the Sun at 1 au. The equations of motion are numerically integrated for 0.1–1 GeV n−1 H+, 3He2+, and 4He2+ test ions as they move in the Parker spiral interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) carried by the solar wind. Pitch-angle scattering is included by using an ad hoc scattering operator, resulting in a parallel mean free path corresponding to “weak” scattering (λ = 1 au). Our modeled field also includes a flat heliospheric current sheet (HCS) at the ecliptic plane. We consider both A– and A+ IMF polarities and determine the time-flux profile at 1 au, at multiple observation locations, for each ion species and energy. We find that the proximity of the observer to the HCS, magnetic connectivity, and the drifts that depend on kinetic energy, m/q, and IMF polarity strongly impact the resulting flux–time profile. We find significant differences between the onset time, decay time, peak flux, and initial flux of the three ion species at 1 au. This contrast in the decay phase of the three species is evident in the four edges of the magnetically well-connected areas at 1 au. For magnetically poorly connected observers to the source, the onset of the proton flux with respect to that of 3He2+, and 4He2+ can be delayed for several hours depending on the observer’s relative heliographic latitude and the SEPs' energy.

<title>Flat U-Net: An Efficient Ultralightweight Model for Solar Filament Segmentation in Full-disk Hα Images</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adadff</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Solar filaments are one of the most prominent features observed on the Sun, and their evolutions are closely related to various solar activities, such as flares and coronal mass ejections. Real-time automated identification of solar filaments is the most effective approach to managing large volumes of data. Existing models of filament identification are characterized by large parameter sizes and high computational costs, which limit their future applications in highly integrated and intelligent ground-based and space-borne observation devices. Consequently, the design of more lightweight models will facilitate the advancement of intelligent observation equipment. In this study, we introduce Flat U-Net, a novel and highly efficient ultralightweight model that incorporates simplified channel attention (SCA) and channel self-attention (CSA) convolutional blocks for the segmentation of solar filaments in full-disk Hα images. Feature information from each network layer is fully extracted to reconstruct interchannel feature representations. Each block effectively optimizes the channel features from the previous layer, significantly reducing parameters. The network architecture presents an elegant flattening, improving its efficiency, and simplifying the overall design. Experimental validation demonstrates that a model composed of pure SCAs achieves a precision of approximately 0.93, with dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and recall rates of 0.76 and 0.64, respectively, significantly outperforming the classical U-Net. Introducing a certain number of CSA blocks improves the DSC and recall rates to 0.82 and 0.74, respectively, which demonstrates a pronounced advantage, particularly concerning model weight size and detection effectiveness. The data set, models, and code are available as open-source resources.

<title>Flux-rope-mediated Turbulent Magnetic Reconnection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a new model of magnetic reconnection in the presence of turbulence. The new model differs from the Lazarian–Vishniac turbulent reconnection theory by emphasizing the role of locally coherent magnetic structures, whose existence is shown to be permitted by the properties of magnetic field line separation in turbulent plasma. Local coherence allows storage of magnetic helicity inside the reconnection layer in the form of locally coherent twisted flux ropes. We then introduce the “Alfvén horizon” to explain why the global reconnection rate can be governed by locally coherent magnetic field structure instead of by field line wandering, formally extending to 3D the principle that reconnection can be made fast by fragmentation of the global current layer. Coherence is shown to dominate over field line dispersion if the anisotropy of the turbulence at the perpendicular scale matching the thickness of a marginally stable current layer exceeds the aspect ratio of the current layer. Finally, we conjecture that turbulence generated within the reconnection layer may produce a critically balanced state that maintains the system in the flux-rope-mediated regime. The new model successfully accounts for the major features of 3D numerical simulations of self-generated turbulent reconnection, including reconnection rates of 0.01 in resistive MHD and 0.1 with collisionless physics.

<title>Exploring the Key Features of Repeating Fast Radio Bursts with Machine Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic high-energy events with unknown origins, which are observationally divided into two categories, i.e., repeaters and nonrepeaters. However, there are potentially a number of nonrepeaters that may be misclassified, as repeating bursts are missed due to the limited sensitivity and observation periods, thus misleading the investigation of their physical properties. In this work, we propose a repeater identification method based on the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding algorithm and apply the classification to the first Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) catalog. We find that the spectral morphology parameters, specifically spectral running (r), represent the key features for identifying repeaters from the nonrepeaters. Also, the results suggest that repeaters are more biased toward narrowband emission, whereas nonrepeaters are inclined toward broadband emission. We provide a list of 163 repeater candidates, five of which are confirmed with an updated repeater catalog from CHIME/FRB. Our findings improve our understanding of the various properties underlying repeaters and nonrepeaters, as well as guidelines for future FRB detection and categorization.

<title>Spin Evolution and Mass Distribution of Galactic Binary Neutron Stars</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90e2</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90e2</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Binary neutron stars (BNSs) detected in the Milky Way have total masses distributing narrowly around ∼2.6–2.7M⊙, while the BNS merger GW190425 detected via a gravitational wave has a significantly larger mass (∼3.4M⊙). This difference is not well understood, yet. In this paper, we investigate the BNS spin evolution via an improved binary star evolution model and its effects on the BNS observability, with the implementation of various relevant astrophysical processes. We find that the first-born neutron star component in low-mass BNSs can be spun up to millisecond pulsars by the accretion of Roche-lobe overflow from its companion and its radio lifetime can be comparable to the Hubble time. However, most high-mass BNSs have substantially shorter radio lifetimes than low-mass BNSs, and thus a smaller probability of being detected via radio emission. Adopting the star formation and metal enrichment history of the Milky Way given by observations, we obtain the survived Galactic BNSs with pulsar components from our population synthesis model and find that their distributions on the diagrams of the spin period versus the spin period time derivative ( ) and the orbital period versus the eccentricity (Porb–e) can well match those of the observed Galactic BNSs. The total mass distribution of the observed Galactic BNSs can also be matched by the model. A significant fraction (∼19%–22%) of merging BNSs at redshift z ∼ 0 have masses ≳3M⊙, which seems compatible with the GW observations. Future radio observations may detect many more Galactic BNSs, which will put strong constraints on the spin evolution of BNSs during their formation processes.

<title>Chemically Self-consistent Modeling of the Globular Cluster NGC 2808 and its Effects on the Inferred Helium Abundance of Multiple Stellar Populations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The helium abundances in the multiple populations that are now known to comprise all closely studied Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) are often inferred by fitting isochrones generated from stellar evolutionary models to GC photometry. It is therefore important to build stellar models that are chemically self-consistent in terms of their structure, atmosphere, and opacity. In this work we present the first chemically self-consistent stellar models of the Milky Way GC NGC 2808 using MARCS model atmospheres, OPLIB high-temperature radiative opacities, and AESOPUS low-temperature radiative opacities. These stellar models were fit to the NGC 2808 photometry using Fidanka, a new software tool that was developed to optimally fit cluster photometry to isochrones and for population synthesis. Fidanka can determine, in a relatively unbiased way, the ideal number of distinct populations that exist within a data set and then fit isochrones to each population. We achieve this outcome through a combination of Bayesian Gaussian mixture modeling and a novel number density estimation algorithm. Using Fidanka and F275W – F814W photometry from the Hubble UV Globular Cluster Survey, we find that the helium abundance of the second generation of stars in NGC 2808 is higher than the first generation by 15% ± 3%. This is in agreement with previous studies of NGC 2808. This work, along with previous work by A. Dotter et al. focused on NGC 6752, demonstrates that chemically self-consistent models of GCs do not significantly alter inferred helium abundances and are therefore unlikely to be worth the significant additional time investment.

<title>Estimating the Mass Escaping Rates of Radius-valley-spanning Planets in the TOI-431 System via X-Ray and Ultraviolet Evaporation</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada607</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada607</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The TOI-431 system has three close-in exoplanets, which gives an ideal lab to study gas escape. In this study, we measure the X-ray and ultraviolet luminosity for TOI-431 with XMM-Newton’s European Photon Imaging Camera-pn and Optical/UV Monitor Telescope data, then calculate the fluxes for the planets in the system. We find TOI-431 b’s is 75 times TOI-431 d’s . Adopting the energy limit method and hydrodynamic code ATES with a set of He/H ratios, we obtain mass-loss rates of g s−1 for TOI-431 b and and 109.84∼9.94 g s−1 for TOI-431 d. We predict 2.93% ∼ 7.91% H i Lyα and 0.19% ∼ 10.65% He i triplet absorption depths for TOI-431 d; thus, its gas escaping is detectable in principle. For both TOI-431 b and d, we select similar planets from the New Generation Planetary Population Synthesis data. They show that, considering the mass-loss rates, TOI-431 b should be a naked solid planet, and TOI-431 d will likely maintain its gas envelope until the host star dies. According to the formation and evolution tracks, we find that TOI-431 b’s potential birthplace (0.1–2 au) should be further in than TOI-431 d’s (2–12 au). Our results are consistent with the interpretation of the radius valley being caused by atmospheric escape. The intrinsic reason may be their birthplace, which will determine how close they can migrate to the host star, then lose mass and result in the Fulton gap.

<title>Toward Early-type Eclipsing Binaries as Extragalactic Milestones. IV. Physical Properties of Three Detached O/B-type Systems in the LMC</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9dda</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9dda</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a complete set of physical parameters for three early-type eclipsing binary systems in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC): OGLE LMC-ECL-17660, OGLE LMC-ECL-18794, and HV 2274, together with the orbital solutions. The first and third systems comprise B-type stars, while the second has O-type components and exhibits a total eclipse. We performed a complex analysis that included modeling light and radial velocity curves, O − C analysis, and additional non-LTE spectroscopic analysis for the O-type system. We found that OGLE LMC-ECL-17660 is at least a triple, and tentatively, a quadruple. A significant nonlinear period decrease was determined for HV 2274. Its origin is unclear, possibly due to a faint, low-mass companion on a wide orbit. The analyzed components have masses ranging from 11.7 M⊙ to 22.1 M⊙, radii from 7.0 R⊙ to 14.2 R⊙, and temperatures between 22,500 and 36,000 K. For HV 2274, the precision of our masses and radii is about six times higher than in previous studies. The position of the components of all six systems analyzed in this series on the mass–luminosity and mass–radius diagrams indicates they are evolutionarily advanced on the main sequence. Our sample contributes significantly to the knowledge of physical parameters of early-type stars in the mass range of 11 M⊙–23 M⊙. A new mass–luminosity relation for O- and B-type stars in the LMC is provided. Additionally, we used the measured apsidal motion of the systems to compare the observational and theoretical internal structure constant.

<title>Prediction of Star Formation Rates Using an Artificial Neural Network</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada366</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this study we develop an artificial neural network to estimate the infrared (IR) luminosity and star formation rates (SFR) of galaxies. Our network is trained using “true” IR luminosity values derived from modeling the IR spectral energy distributions of FIR-detected galaxies. We explore five different sets of input features, each incorporating optical, mid-infrared, near-infrared, ultraviolet, and emission line data, along with spectroscopic redshifts and uncertainties. All feature sets yield similar IR luminosity predictions, but including all photometric data leads to slightly improved performance. This suggests that comprehensive photometric information enhances the accuracy of our predictions. Our network is applied to a sample of SDSS galaxies defined as unseen data, and the results are compared with three published catalogs of SFRs. Overall, our network demonstrates excellent performance for star-forming galaxies, while we observe discrepancies in composite and AGN samples. These inconsistencies may stem from uncertainties inherent in the compared catalogs or potential limitations in the performance of our network.

<title>Solar Variability in the Mg ii h and k Lines</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Solar irradiance and its variations in the ultraviolet (UV) control the photochemistry in Earth's atmosphere and influence Earth's climate. The variability in the Mg ii h and k core-to-wing ratio, also known as the Mg ii index, is highly correlated with the solar UV irradiance variability. Because of this, the Mg ii index is routinely used as a proxy for solar UV irradiance variability, which can help to get insights into the influence of solar UV irradiance variability on Earth's climate. Measurements of the Mg ii index, however, have only been carried out since 1978 and do not cover climate-relevant timescales longer than a few decades. Here we present a model to calculate the Mg ii index and its variability based on the well-established Spectral And Total Irradiance REconstruction (SATIRE) model. We demonstrate that our model calculations yield an excellent agreement with the observed Mg ii index variations, both on the solar activity cycle and on the solar rotation timescales. Using this model, we synthesize the Mg ii index time series on climate-relevant timescales of decades and longer. Here we present the time series of the Mg ii index spanning nearly three centuries.

<title>MUSEQuBES: Connecting H i Absorption with Lyα Emitters at z ≈ 3.3</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada7e9</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada7e9</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a comprehensive analysis of H i absorption around 96 Lyα emitters (LAEs) at z ≈ 3.3 (median Lyα luminosity ≈1042 erg s−1). These LAEs were identified within eight MUSE fields, each on the sky and centered on a bright background quasar, as part of the MUSEQuBES survey. Using Voigt profile fitting for all H i absorbers detected within ±500 km s−1 of these LAEs, we compiled a catalog of 800 H i absorption components. Our analysis shows that H i absorption is enhanced near the LAEs compared to the intergalactic medium. However, no trend is found between the column densities of H i absorbers and their impact parameters from the LAEs (spanning ≈54–260 pkpc). Additionally, all galaxies associated with Lyman-limit systems have impact parameters >50 pkpc from the quasar sightlines, suggesting that true absorber hosts may be too faint to detect. The LAEs show an overall H i covering fraction (fc(H i)) of ≈88% for a threshold (H i) = 15. Notably, at the same threshold, the LAEs in pairs/groups exhibit a 100% H i covering fraction out to ≈250 pkpc. In contrast, isolated LAEs consistently show a lower fc(H i) of ≈80%. This environmental influence on fc(H i) is also evident up to ≈300 km s−1 in differential bins of line-of-sight velocity. We find an anticorrelation between fc(H i) and the equivalent width of rest-frame Lyα emission (EW0). Based on the Lyα shell model, this could imply that gas-rich galaxies tend to reside in gas-rich environments or that the LAEs with higher EW0 are more efficient at ionizing their surrounding medium.

<title>Comprehensive Parameter Determination of Exoplanets through Asteroseismic Host Star Constraints</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study develops a robust framework for exoplanet characterization by leveraging asteroseismic constraints on host stars. Using precise photometric data from missions such as Kepler and TESS, we derive stellar parameters, including mass, radius, and age, with high accuracy through asteroseismic analysis. These stellar parameters are incorporated as priors in a Bayesian framework to refine planetary properties such as the mass, radius, and orbital parameters. By applying Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, we extract posterior distributions of planetary parameters, achieving significant improvements in precision and reliability. This approach is particularly effective for systems with evolved host stars, where precise stellar properties are essential for resolving uncertainties in planetary characterization. The results demonstrate the importance of asteroseismology in bridging stellar astrophysics and exoplanet science, enabling detailed studies of planetary system architectures and their dependence on host star properties. Our methodology underscores the synergy between stellar and planetary studies, paving the way for future research on exoplanet populations. This work provides a foundation for utilizing data from upcoming missions like PLATO, ensuring continued advancements in the precision and scope of exoplanet characterization.

<title>LensWatch. II. Improved Photometry and Time-delay Constraints on the Strongly Lensed Type Ia Supernova 2022qmx (“SN Zwicky”) with Hubble Space Telescope Template Observations</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada776</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Strongly lensed supernovae (SNe) are a rare class of transient that can offer tight cosmological constraints that are complementary to methods from other astronomical events. We present a follow-up study of one recently discovered strongly lensed SN, the quadruply imaged type Ia SN 2022qmx (aka “SN Zwicky”), at z = 0.3544. We measure updated, template-subtracted photometry for SN Zwicky and derive improved time delays and magnifications. This is possible because SNe are transient, fading away after reaching their peak brightness. Specifically, we measure point-spread-function photometry for all four images of SN Zwicky in three Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/UVIS passbands (F475W, F625W, and F814W) and one WFC3/IR passband (F160W), with template images taken ∼11 months after the epoch in which the SN images appear. We find consistency to within 2σ between lens-model-predicted time delays (≲1 day) and measured time delays with HST colors (≲2 days), including the uncertainty from chromatic microlensing that may arise from stars in the lensing galaxy. The standardizable nature of SNe Ia allows us to estimate absolute magnifications for the four images, with images A and C being elevated in magnification compared to lens model predictions by about 6σ and 3σ, respectively, confirming previous work. We show that millilensing or differential dust extinction is unable to explain these discrepancies, and we find evidence for the existence of microlensing in images A, C, and potentially D that may contribute to the anomalous magnification.

<title>Hubble Space Telescope Observations within the Sphere of Influence of the Powerful Supermassive Black Hole in PKS 0745-191</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada7ed</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph observations from the Hubble Space Telescope of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of PKS 0745-191, a brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) undergoing powerful radio-mode active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback (Pcav ~ 5 × 1045 erg s−1). These high-resolution data offer the first spatially resolved map of gas dynamics within an SMBH's sphere of influence under such powerful feedback. Our results reveal the presence of highly chaotic, nondrotational ionized gas flows on subkiloparsec scales, in contrast to the more coherent flows observed on larger scales. While radio-mode feedback effectively thermalizes hot gas in galaxy clusters on kiloparsec scales, within the core, the hot gas flow may decouple, leading to a reduction in angular momentum and supplying ionized gas through cooling, which could enhance accretion onto the SMBH. This process could, in turn, lead to a self-regulating feedback loop. Compared to other BCGs with weaker radio-mode feedback, where rotation is more stable, intense feedback may lead to more chaotic flows, indicating a stronger coupling between jet activity and gas dynamics. Additionally, we observe a sharp increase in velocity dispersion near the nucleus, consistent with a very massive MBH ~ 1.5 × 1010M⊙ SMBH. The density profile of the ionized gas is also notably flat, paralleling the profiles observed in X-ray gas around galaxies where the Bondi radius is resolved. These results provide valuable insights into the complex mechanisms driving galaxy evolution, highlighting the intricate relationship between SMBH fueling and AGN feedback within the host galaxy.

<title>Nonthermal Signatures of Radiative Supernova Remnants. II. The Impact of Cosmic Rays and Magnetic Fields</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada93d</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada93d</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Near the ends of their lives, supernova remnants (SNRs) enter a “radiative phase,” when efficient cooling of the postshock gas slows expansion. Understanding SNR evolution at this stage is crucial for estimating feedback in galaxies, as SNRs are expected to release energy and momentum into the interstellar medium near the ends of their lives. A standard prediction of SNR evolutionary models is that the onset of the radiative stage precipitates the formation of a dense shell behind the forward shock. In Paper I, we showed that such shell formation yields detectable nonthermal radiation from radio to γ-rays, most notably emission brightening by nearly 2 orders of magnitude. However, there remains no observational evidence for such brightening, suggesting that this standard prediction needs to be investigated. In this paper, we perform magnetohydrodynamic simulations of SNR evolution through the radiative stage, including cosmic rays (CRs) and magnetic fields to assess their dynamical roles. We find that both sources of nonthermal pressure impede shell formation, reducing shell densities by a factor of a few to more than an order of magnitude. We also use a self-consistent model of particle acceleration to estimate the nonthermal emission from these modified SNRs and demonstrate that, for reasonable CR acceleration efficiencies and magnetic field strengths, the nonthermal signatures of shell formation can all but disappear. We therefore conclude that the absence of observational signatures of shell formation represents strong evidence that nonthermal pressures from CRs and magnetic fields play a critical dynamical role in late-stage SNR evolution.

<title>Magnetized Protoplanetary Disks around Young Stars in the Presence of Realistic Cooling</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this paper, we study the effects of magnetic fields and ohmic resistivity on the structure of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) in the presence of realistic radiative cooling. We use the self-similar method to solve the magnetohydrodynamic equations in spherical coordinates (r, θ, ϕ). Our solutions indicate that a strong magnetic field reduces the outflow region while increasing the mass accretion rate, which in turn leads to a thicker disk. Our model applied to the FU Orionis PPD indicates that in the inner regions of the disk (r = 10 au), is the order of and the mass outflow rate is , which is consistent with the observed range of accretion rates. Additionally, we calculated the cooling timescale in our model to assess one possible fragmentation condition necessary for planet formation. Our results indicate that, although the gravitational instability condition exists in the midplane of the disk, the cooling timescale is not short enough (τcool ≈ 1000Ω−1), and one possible mechanism for planet formation is not met.

<title>The Secondary Component of the Extremely Low Mass Ratio Massive Binary HD 165246 Revealed by GHOST</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In the pursuit of understanding the multiplicity of massive stars, the OWN Survey has undertaken spectroscopic monitoring of hundreds of targets over the past 20 yr. This effort has led to the discovery of new single-lined spectroscopic binaries. Characterizing the unseen companions of these systems is crucial to deriving precise stellar parameters, including the mass of each component, and constraining formation models for massive binary systems. In this paper, we aim to physically and evolutionarily characterize the stellar components of the massive binary HD 165246. We analyzed spectra obtained by the OWN Survey and used Kepler's second mission (K2) photometry, from which we determined the physical parameters of the system. Thanks to the high-resolution capabilities of the new echelle spectrograph Gemini/GHOST, we could directly detect spectral features of the secondary component for the first time. A very low mass ratio for the system is confirmed (q ~ 0.16), making this binary one of the few extremely low mass ratio systems known. The primary star has a mass of Ma = 22 ± 1 M⊙ and a radius of Ra = 7.0 ± 0.1 R⊙, while the secondary star has a mass of Mb = 3.4 ± 0.1 M⊙ and a radius of Rb = 2.22 ± 0.02 R⊙. Stellar evolution models indicate that the system has undergone approximately two million years of evolution since its formation. Moreover, the secondary star is identified as a pre-main-sequence object, progressing toward the zero-age main sequence. This paper illustrates the power of high-resolution spectrographs such as GHOST in finding much lower mass, previously unseen stellar components of binary star systems.

<title>Improved SED-fitting Assumptions Result in Inside-out Quenching at z ~ 0.5 and Quenching at All Radii Simultaneously at z ~ 1</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada8a2</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada8a2</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Many studies conclude that galaxies quench from the inside-out by examining profiles of specific star formation rate (sSFR). These are usually measured by fitting spectral energy distributions (SEDs) assuming a fixed dust law and uniform priors on all parameters. Here, we examine the effects of more physically motivated priors: a flexible dust law, an exponential prior on the dust attenuation AV, and Gaussian priors that favor extended star formation histories. This results in model colors that better trace observations. We then perform radial SED fits to multiband flux profiles measured from Hubble Space Telescope images for 1440 galaxies at 0.4 < z < 1.5 of stellar masses 1010–1011.5M⊙ using both the traditional and the more physically motivated assumptions. The latter results in star formation rate and AV profiles that agree with measurements from spectroscopy and AV profiles that behave correctly as a function of inclination. Since green valley galaxies at z ∼ 1.3 are expected to evolve into quiescent galaxies at z ∼ 0.9, we compare their sSFR profiles using the more physically motivated assumptions. Their slopes are similar at all masses (0.06–0.08 dex kpc−1), and the normalizations for the quiescent galaxies are lower. Therefore, the sSFR profiles decline with time as quenching occurs at all radii simultaneously. We compare profiles of green valley galaxies at z ∼ 0.9 and quiescent galaxies at z ∼ 0.5. The former are shallower at all masses by ~0.1 dex kpc−1. The sSFR profiles steepen with time as galaxies quench from the inside-out. In summary, galaxies at z ∼ 1 quench at all radii simultaneously while galaxies at z ∼ 0.7 quench from the inside-out.

We present Vela.jl, an efficient, modular, easy-to-use Bayesian pulsar timing and noise analysis package written in Julia. Vela.jl provides an independent, efficient, and parallelized implementation of the full nonlinear pulsar timing and noise model along with a Python binding named pyvela.

<title>Search for Neutrino Signals Correlated with LHAASO Diffuse Galactic Emission</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adabe8</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The diffuse Galactic γ-ray emission originates from the interactions between cosmic rays and the interstellar medium or radiation fields within our Galaxy, where the production of neutrinos is also anticipated. Recently, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) reported measurements of diffuse γ-rays from the Galactic plane with energies ranging from sub-TeV to 1 PeV. Using 7 yr of publicly available IceCube track data with the full detector, we conduct a template search using the γ-ray flux map observed by LHAASO-KM2A as the neutrino emission template and perform a scan search of the Galactic plane. In the template search, a mild excess of neutrinos is observed in the Galactic plane with a pretrial (posttrial) significance of 1.9σ (1.1σ). The measured muon neutrino intensity at 25 TeV is , consistent with the expected neutrino flux assuming that all the diffuse Galactic γ-rays originate from hadronic interactions. In the Galactic plane scan search, the most significant location is found at l = 63 57 and b = 0 93 with a pretrial (posttrial) significance of 4.6σ (1.8σ).

<title>Toward High-order Solar Corona Simulations: A High-order Hyperbolized Poisson Approach for Magnetic Field Initialization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Proper initialization of the solar corona magnetic field is important for easing the iterative process of realistic and efficient global magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations. This study introduces a high-order flux reconstruction (FR) framework for solving the Poisson equation, a necessary step for computing a potential-field source-surface (PFSS) to initialize the magnetic field for global solar corona simulations with MHD. By hyperbolizing the elliptic Poisson equation into a set of hyperbolic equations, we develop an efficient and robust high-order PFSS solver. Our contributions include developing a Q2 (i.e., quadratic) geometrical representation using prismatic elements for the computational domain, which enables high-order mesh generation. Such a hyperbolized Poisson solver effectively relaxes magnetic fields extrapolated from solar magnetograms, producing scalar potential fields that align well with theoretical expectations. Extensive verification was conducted on the high-order FR solver for polynomial orders up to P3, achieving fourth-order spatial accuracy. The hyperbolized solver demonstrates comparable accuracy to reference solutions (both analytical and numerical) while offering efficient performance, particularly on coarser meshes, making it competitive with state-of-the-art low-order finite volume solvers, which are mostly used for solar MHD simulations. The described developments are a milestone for enabling high-order global solar corona simulations on 3D unstructured grids.

<title>ASKAP Observations of the Radio Shell in the Composite Supernova Remnant G310.6-1.6</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the observations of the radio shell of the supernova remnant (SNR) G310.6–1.6 at 943 MHz from the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) and the Polarization Sky Survey of the Universe’s Magnetism (POSSUM) surveys by using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). We detect polarized emission from the central pulsar wind nebula (PWN) with rotation measures varying from –696 rad m−2 to –601 rad m−2. We measure the integrated flux density of the shell to be 36.4 ± 2.2 mJy at 943 MHz and derive a spectral index of αpwn = −0.4 ± 0.1 for the PWN and αshell = −0.7 ± 0.3 for the SNR shell. From the combined radio and X-ray observations, the object can be identified as a supernova explosion of about 2500 yr ago with an energy of about 1.3 × 1050 erg, suggesting an ejected mass of about 10 M⊙. The circular radio shell outside the circular hard X-ray shell is unique among Galactic SNRs. We discuss several possible scenarios, including blast wave, reverse shock, and pulsar-fed emission, but find that none of them can fully explain the observed characteristics of the shell. This poses a challenge for understanding the evolution of SNRs. The results of this paper demonstrate the potential of the ASKAP EMU and POSSUM surveys to discover more objects of small angular size and low surface brightness.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report an analysis of Insight-HXMT observations of the newly discovered accreting millisecond pulsar SRGA J144459.2–604207. During the outburst, detected in 2024 February by SRG/ART-XC, the broadband persistent spectrum was well fitted by an absorbed Comptonization model. We detected 60 type I X-ray bursts in the Insight-HXMT medium energy (ME) data, and 37 were also detected with the low-energy (LE) telescope. By superimposing the Insight-HXMT/LE/ME/HE light curves of 37 bursts with similar profiles and intensities, we measured a deficit of X-rays in the 40–70 keV energy band. By analyzing the time-resolved X-ray burst spectra, we determine the mean ratio of persistent to burst flux ofα = 71 ± 7. We estimate the average hydrogen mass fraction in the fuel at ignition, as , and constrain the burst fuel composition as X0 ≲ 0.4. We found that 14 out of 60 X-ray bursts exhibited photospheric expansion, and thus we estimated the distance to the source as 10.03 ± 0.71 kpc. Combined with IXPE observations, the burst recurrence time increased from 1.55 to 8 hr as the local mass accretion rate decreased, which can be described as .

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
1LHAASO J0249+6022 is an extended very-high-energy γ-ray source discovered by the Large High-Altitude Air Shower Observatory. Based on nearly 16.1 yr of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope, we report the probable γ-ray emission from 1LHAASO J0249+6022 in the 0.03–1 TeV energy range. The results show that its γ-ray spectrum can be well fitted by a single power law with an index of 1.54 ± 0.17, and integral photon flux is (4.28 ± 1.03) × 10−11 photons cm−2 s−1. We also considered theoretically whether the nonthermal emission could originate from a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) scenario. Assuming that the particles injected into the nebula have a power-law distribution, the resulting spectrum from the inverse Compton scattering is consistent with the detected GeV and TeV γ-ray fluxes. Our study shows that the PWN scenario is reasonable for 1LHAASO J0249+6022.

<title>The Detection Rate of Associated Mg ii Absorption Lines in Quasars Depends on Their Radio Emission</title>

In active galactic nuclei, jet-driven feedback plays a significant role in influencing the properties of gas within their host galaxy and the circumgalactic medium. By combining observations from the Very Large Array Sky Survey, the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm, the LOFAR Two Meter Sky Survey, and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we assembled a sample of 3141 radio-loud quasars, among which 418 exhibit Mg ii-associated absorption lines in their SDSS spectra. We classify these quasars into evolutionary stages based on their radio spectral shapes. Our analysis reveals that evolved quasars exhibit a significantly higher incidence of Mg ii-associated absorption lines compared to younger sources, particularly among quasars with “nonpeaked” radio spectra, which show an incidence of Mg ii-associated absorbers approximately 1.7 times greater than that of gigahertz-peaked spectrum sources. This observation can be explained effectively by jet-driven feedback. As quasars age, their jets expand and expel substantial amounts of gas from smaller scales to larger scales, ultimately reaching the circumgalactic medium. The gas expelled from the inner regions and distributed over larger scales results in a greater coverage fraction of absorbing gas. Consequently, evolved quasars exhibit a higher incidence of Mg ii absorption lines.

Plasmoids (or magnetic islands) are believed to play an important role in the onset of fast magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration during solar flares and eruptions. Direct imaging of flare current sheets and the formation/ejection of multiple plasmoids in extreme-ultraviolet images, along with simultaneous X-ray and radio observations, offers significant insights into the mechanisms driving particle acceleration in solar flares. Here, we present direct imaging of the formation and ejection of multiple plasmoids in flare plasma/current sheets and the associated quasiperiodic pulsations (QPPs) observed at X-ray and radio wavelengths, using observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly, RHESSI, and the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor. These plasmoids propagate bidirectionally upward and downward along the flare current sheet beneath the erupting flux rope during two successive flares associated with confined/failed eruptions. The flux rope exhibits evidence of helical kink instability, with the formation and ejection of multiple plasmoids in the flare current sheet, as predicted in an MHD simulation of a kink-unstable flux rope. RHESSI X-ray images show double coronal sources (“looptop” and higher coronal sources) located at both ends of the flare current/plasma sheet. Moreover, we detect an additional transient faint X-ray source (6–12 keV) located between the double coronal sources, which is cospatial with multiple plasmoids in the flare current sheet. X-ray (soft and hard) and radio (decimetric) observations unveil QPPs (periods ≈ 10 s and 100 s) associated with the ejection and coalescence of plasmoids. These observations suggest that energetic electrons are accelerated during the ejection and coalescence of multiple plasmoids in the flare current sheet.

<title>Magnetorotational Instability in Collisional Weakly Ionized Plasma with Distinct Species Velocities</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In a differential rotating system, we use the incompressible multifluid model to investigate the dynamics of a weakly ionized plasma placed in a vertical background magnetic field with radial shearing. The equilibrium current is taken into account. The differences in velocities between charged species and neutrals are supposed to be related to the collisions. The analytical expression of the general local dispersion relation is derived and the effect of the shearing magnetic field is demonstrated in three different limiting cases. Momentum transfer to neutrals is neglected in the first case, and the instability criteria are provided with the involvement of magnetic field shearing. In the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) case, the previous results are reproduced when setting the equilibrium current density to zero, and the magnetic field structure is depicted to restrain/reinforce the instability in the Keplerian system with decaying/increasing shearing. In the last case, the finite collisions with weak ionization and ion Hall effects generate another unstable vertical mode compared with the MHD case and also alleviate the unstable waves propagated between the horizontal and vertical directions.

<title>WALLABY Pilot Survey: Star Formation Enhancement and Suppression in Gas-rich Galaxy Pairs</title>

Galaxy interactions can significantly affect the star formation in galaxies, but it remains a challenge to achieve a consensus on the star formation rate (SFR) enhancement in galaxy pairs. Here, we investigate the SFR enhancement of gas-rich galaxy pairs detected by the Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY. We construct a sample of 278 paired galaxies spanning a stellar mass (M*) range from 107.6 to 1011.2M⊙. We obtain individual masses of atomic hydrogen (H i) for these paired galaxies using a novel deblending algorithm for H i data cubes. Quantifying the interaction stages and strengths with parameters motivated by first-principles analysis, we find that, at fixed stellar and H i mass, the alteration in the SFR of galaxy pairs starts when their dark matter halos are encountered. For galaxies with a stellar mass lower than 109M⊙, their SFRs show tentative suppression of 1.4σ after the halo encounter, and then become enhanced when their H i disks overlap, regardless of mass ratios. In contrast, the SFRs of galaxies with M* > 109M⊙ increase monotonically toward smaller projected distances and radial velocity offsets. When a close companion is present, a pronounced SFR enhancement is found for the most H i-poor high-mass galaxies in our sample. Collecting the observational evidence, we provide a coherent picture of the evolution of galaxy pairs and discuss how the tidal effects and hydrodynamic processes shape the SFR enhancement. Our results provide a coherent picture of gas-rich galaxy interactions and impose constraints on the underlying physical processes.

<title>Blowin’ in the Nonisothermal Wind: Core-powered Mass Loss with Hydrodynamic Radiative Transfer</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada777</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The mass loss rates of planets undergoing core-powered escape are usually modeled using an isothermal Parker-type wind at the equilibrium temperature, Teq. However, the upper atmospheres of sub-Neptunes may not be isothermal if there are significant differences between the opacity to incident visible and outgoing infrared radiation. We model bolometrically driven escape using AIOLOS, a hydrodynamic radiative-transfer code that incorporates double-gray opacities, to investigate the process’s dependence on the visible-to-infrared opacity ratio, γ. For a value of γ ≈ 1, we find that the resulting mass loss rates are well approximated by a Parker-type wind with an isothermal temperature T = Teq/21/4. However, we show that over a range of physically plausible values of γ, the mass loss rates can vary by orders of magnitude, ranging from 10−5× the isothermal rate for low γ to 105× the isothermal rate for high γ. The differences in mass loss rates are largest for small planet radii, while for large planet radii, mass loss rates become nearly independent of γ and approach the isothermal approximation. We incorporate these opacity-dependent mass loss rates into a self-consistent planetary mass and energy evolution model and show that lower/higher γ values lead to more/less hydrogen being retained after core-powered mass loss. In some cases, the choice of opacities determines whether or not a planet can retain a significant primordial hydrogen atmosphere. The dependence of escape rate on the opacity ratio may allow atmospheric escape observations to directly constrain a planet's opacities and therefore its atmospheric composition.

<title>Spin-down of Solar-mass Protostars in Magnetospheric Accretion Paradigm</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Stellar spin is one of the fundamental quantities that characterize a star itself and its planetary system. Nevertheless, stellar spin-down mechanisms in protostellar and pre-main-sequence stellar phases have been a long-standing problem in star formation theory. To realize the spin-down, previous axisymmetric models based on the conventional magnetospheric paradigm have had to assume massive stellar winds or produce highly time-variable magnetospheric ejections. However, this picture has been challenged by both numerical simulations and observations. With a particular focus on the propeller regime for solar-mass stars, we propose a new picture of stellar spin-down based on our recent 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulation and stellar evolution calculation. We show that failed magnetospheric winds, unique to 3D models, significantly reduce the spin-up accretion torque, which make it easier for the star to spin-down. Additionally, the amplitude of time variability associated with magnetospheric ejections is reduced by 3D effects. Our simulation demonstrates that the star spins down by generating a conical disk wind, driven by a rotating stellar magnetosphere. Our theoretical estimates, inspired by the numerical model, suggest that the conical disk wind is likely to play a crucial role in extracting stellar angular momentum during the protostellar phase. As magnetospheric accretion is expected to occur in other accreting objects such as protogiant planets, this study will also contribute to the understanding of the angular momentum of such objects.

<title>The Unique Helium Nova V445 Puppis Ejected ≫0.001 M ⊙ in the Year 2000 and Will Not Become a Type Ia Supernova</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
V445 Puppis (Nova Puppis 2000) is the only known example of a helium nova, where a layer of helium-rich gas accretes onto the surface of a white dwarf (WD) in a cataclysmic variable, with runaway helium burning making for the nova event. Speculatively, a helium nova can provide one path to produce a Type Ia supernova (SNIa), within the larger framework of single-degenerate models. Relatively little has been known about V445 Pup, with this work reporting the discovery of the orbital period near 1.87 days. The companion star is 2.65 ± 0.35 R⊙ in radius as an evolved giant star stripped of its outer hydrogen envelope. The orbital period immediately before the 2000 eruption was = 1.871843 ± 0.000014 days, with a steady period change of (−0.17 ± 0.06) × 10−8 from 1896 to 1995. The period immediately after the nova eruption was Ppost = 1.873593 ± 0.000034 days, with a of (−4.7 ± 0.5) × 10−8. The fractional orbital period change (ΔP/P) is +935 ± 27 ppm. This restricts the mass of the gases ejected in the nova eruption to be ≫0.001 M⊙, and much greater than the mass accreted to trigger the nova. So the WD is losing mass over each eruption cycle, and will not become a SNIa. Further, for V445 Pup and helium novae in general, I collect observations from 136 normal SNIa for which any giant or subgiant companion star would have been detected, yet zero companions are found. This is an independent proof that V445 Pup and helium novae are not SNIa progenitors.

The Charting Cluster Construction with VUDS and ORELSE (C3VO) survey is an ongoing imaging and spectroscopic campaign aiming to map out the growth of structure up to z ∼ 5 and was born from the combination of the Visible Multi-Object Spectrograph Ultra Deep Survey and the Observations of Redshift Evolution in Large-Scale Environments (ORELSE) survey. As we previously accomplished with the ORELSE survey, we apply our technique known as Voronoi tessellation Monte Carlo (VMC) mapping to search for serendipitous galaxy overdensities at 2 < z < 5 in the three C3VO fields. We also apply the same technique to mock observations of simulated galaxies with properties derived from the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly semianalytic model in order to judge the effectiveness of our search algorithm as a function of redshift, total mass, and fraction of spectroscopic redshifts. We find completeness and purity values of the order of 30%–50% for and 2 < z < 4, with a strong dependence on mass and redshift, with values as high as ∼80% and ∼70%, respectively, in the best-case scenario for . In the C3VO fields, we were able to recover many of the previously known structures in the literature as well as find hundreds of new overdensity candidates, once again demonstrating the powerful capabilities of VMC mapping when applied to wide-field optical and infrared galaxy evolution surveys at ever higher redshifts.

<title>Interstellar Pickup Ion Observations to 60 au</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Prior to the Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) observations from New Horizons, the only significant interstellar pickup ion (PUI) observations were taken inside 5.4 au from the Ulysses and 1 au missions. Here, we analyze SWAP data to provide the first comprehensive radial profile of interstellar PUIs in the outer heliosphere from ∼22 to 60 au. This study is the first to combine the low time resolution (one day) data inside 49.5 au with the high time resolution (half hour) data outside of that. We show that these two data sets can be reliably analyzed together in what is now a nearly continuous set of PUI observations. We derive radial gradients for all of the PUI parameters, as well as ratios to their solar wind counterparts from these combined data and extrapolate them out to a nominal termination shock distance at ∼90 au. We find that the fraction of PUIs to all ions in the solar wind continues to grow, reaching ∼18% by 60 au and extrapolated to be ∼30% at 90 au. The PUI internal pressure is ∼11% of the solar wind dynamic pressure at 60 au and expected to be ∼21% by 90 au. Such large values further highlight the importance of PUIs as the dominant driver of the physics of the outer heliosphere, as well as at the termination shock.

<title>Multiwavelength Variability Analysis of the Blazar PKS 0727-11: An ~ 168 day Quasiperiodic Oscillation in the γ-Ray</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We performed variability analysis of the multiwavelength light curves (LCs) for the flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS 0727-11. Using the generalized Lomb–Scargle periodogram, we identified a possible quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) of ~168.6 days (persisted for six cycles, with a significance of 3.8σ) in the γ-ray LC during the flare period (MJD 54687–55738). It is the first time that periodic variations have been detected in this source, and further supported by other methods: weighted wavelet z-transform, phase dispersion minimization, REDFIT, autoregressive integrated moving average model, and structure function analysis. Cross-correlation analysis shows that there is a strong correlation between multiband light variations, indicating that γ-ray and radio flares may originate from the same disturbance, and the distance between the emission regions of γ-ray and radio flares is calculated based on the time lag. We demonstrate that QPO arising from the non-ballistic helical jet motion driven by the orbital motion in a supermassive binary black hole is a plausible physical explanation. In this scenario, the estimated mass of the primary black hole is M ∼ 3.66 × 108–5.79 × 109 M⊙.

We study the dynamics of nuclear star clusters, the dense stellar environments surrounding massive black holes in the centers of galaxies. We consider angular momentum diffusion due to two-body scatterings among stellar objects and energy advection due to gravitational-wave emission upon interaction with the central massive black hole. Such dynamics are described by a 2D Fokker–Planck (FP) equation in energy–angular momentum space. Focusing on the transition between the diffusion-dominated region and the advection-dominated one, we utilize self-similarity to obtain a full solution for the steady-state FP equation. This solution provides the density and flux of the stellar objects in nuclear star clusters. This improves the rate estimates for extreme-mass ratio inspirals, and has interesting implications for a new class of galactic center transients called quasiperiodic eruptions.

<title>The Impact of Bar-induced Noncircular Motions on the Measurement of Galactic Rotation Curves</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adabe0</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adabe0</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the impact of bar-induced noncircular motions on the derivation of galactic rotation curves (RCs) using hydrodynamic simulations and observational data from the PHANGS-ALMA survey. We confirm that noncircular motions induced by a bar can significantly bias RCs derived from the conventional tilted-ring method, consistent with previous findings. The shape of the derived RC depends on the difference in position angle (Δϕ) between the major axes of the bar and the disk in the face-on plane. For , noncircular motions produce a bar-induced “dip” feature (rise–drop–rise pattern) in the derived RC, which shows higher velocities near the nuclear ring and lower velocities in the bar region compared to the true RC (RCtrue). We demonstrate convincingly that such dip features are very common in the PHANGS-ALMA sample of barred galaxies. Hydrodynamical simulations reveal that the “dip” feature is caused by the perpendicular orientation of the gas flows in the nuclear ring and the bar; at low streamlines in the nuclear ring tend to enhance Vlos, while those in the bar tend to suppress Vlos. We use a simple “misaligned ellipses” model to qualitatively explain the general trend of RCs from the tilted-ring method (RCtilted) and the discrepancy between RCtilted and RCtrue. Furthermore, we propose a straightforward method to implement a first-order correction to the RC derived from the tilted-ring method. Our study is the first to systematically discuss the bar-induced “dip” feature in the RCs of barred galaxies by combining both simulations and observations.

<title>What Drives the H i Content of Central Galaxies—A Comparison between Hydrodynamic Simulations and Observations Using Random Forest</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adace2</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the driving mechanisms for the H i gas content in star-forming central galaxies at low redshift, by examining the H i-to-stellar mass ratio (MH i/M*) in both the state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations, IllustrisTNG (TNG) and EAGLE, and the xGASS sample. We quantify the correlations of MH i/M* with a variety of galaxy properties using the Random Forest regression technique, and we make comparisons between the two simulations, as well as between the simulations and xGASS. Gas-phase metallicity is found to be most important in both simulations, but is ranked mildly for xGASS, suggesting that metals and gas driven by feedback effects in real galaxies is not as tightly coupled as in the simulations. Beyond that, the accretion rate of supermassive black holes is the most important feature in TNG, while specific star formation rate is the top ranked in EAGLE. This result can be understood from the fact that the H i gas is regulated mainly by thermal-mode AGN feedback in TNG and by stellar feedback in EAGLE. Although neither simulation can fully reproduce the feature importance obtained for real galaxies in the xGASS, EAGLE performs better than TNG in the sense that the observationally top-ranked property, u − r, is also highly ranked in EAGLE. This result implies that stellar feedback plays a more dominant role than AGN feedback in driving the H i gas content of low-redshift galaxies.

<title>Continuous Gravitational Waves from Thermal Mountains on Accreting Neutron Stars: Effect of the Nuclear Pasta Phase</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
As density increases, the shape of nuclei transitions to nonspherical “nuclear pasta” structures. The physical properties of the nuclear pasta, such as thermal conductivity and elasticity, have implications for detecting continuous gravitational waves from a rapidly rotating neutron star. In this work, we investigate the effect of the nuclear pasta on the quadruple moment, and find out that, compared with previous work, the quadrupole moment contributing to continuous gravitational-wave radiation can be up to 2 orders of magnitude larger. We also discuss the relationship between the quadruple moment and the maximum shear strain. Considering the properties of nuclear pasta, we study the detectability of known accreting neutron stars and compare predicted results to the detectable amplitude limits. These sources are well above the sensitivity curves for Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope detectors. Our work advances the understanding of the properties of nuclear pasta and a possible mechanism for continuous gravitational waves.

<title>A Multiwavelength Light-curve Analysis of the Classical Nova KT Eri: Optical Contribution from a Large Irradiated Accretion Disk</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
KT Eri is a classical nova that went into outburst in 2009. Recent photometric analysis in quiescence indicates a relatively longer orbital period of 2.6 days, so that KT Eri could host a very bright accretion disk during the outburst like in the recurrent nova U Sco, the orbital period of which is 1.23 days. We reproduced the optical V light curve as well as the supersoft X-ray light curve of KT Eri in outburst, assuming a large irradiated disk during a nova wind phase of the outburst while a normal size disk after the nova winds stop. This result is consistent with the temporal variation of wide-band V brightness that varies almost with the intermediate-band Strömgren y brightness, because the V flux is dominated by continuum radiation, the origin of which is a photospheric emission from the very bright disk. We determined the white dwarf mass to be MWD = 1.3 ± 0.02 M⊙, the hydrogen-burning turnoff epoch to be ∼240 days after the outburst, the distance modulus in the V band to be (m − M)V = 13.4 ± 0.2, and the distance to KT Eri to be d = 4.2 ± 0.4 kpc for the reddening of E(B − V) = 0.08. The peak absolute V brightness is about and the corresponding recurrence time is ∼3000 yr from its ignition mass together with the mean mass-accretion rate of yr−1 in quiescence. Thus, we suggest that KT Eri is not a recurrent nova.

<title>Maximum-likelihood Regression with Systematic Errors for Astronomy and the Physical Sciences. I. Methodology and Goodness-of-fit Statistic of Poisson Data</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b1e</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This paper presents a new statistical method that enables the use of systematic errors in the maximum-likelihood regression of integer-count Poisson data to a parametric model. The method is primarily aimed at the characterization of the goodness-of-fit statistic in the presence of the over-dispersion that is induced by sources of systematic error, and is based on a quasi-maximum-likelihood method that retains the Poisson distribution of the data. We show that the Poisson deviance, which is the usual goodness-of-fit statistic and that is commonly referred to in astronomy as the Cash statistics, can be easily generalized in the presence of systematic errors, under rather general conditions. The method and the associated statistics are first developed theoretically, and then they are tested with the aid of numerical simulations and further illustrated with real-life data from astronomical observations. The statistical methods presented in this paper are intended as a simple general-purpose framework to include additional sources of uncertainty for the analysis of integer-count data in a variety of practical data analysis situations.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel model of systematic errors for the regression of Poisson data is applied to hypothesis testing of nested model components with the introduction of a generalization of the ΔC statistic that applies in the presence of systematic errors. This paper shows that the null-hypothesis parent distribution of this ΔCsys statistic can be obtained either through a simple numerical procedure, or in a closed form by making certain simplifying assumptions. It is found that the effects of systematic errors on the test statistic can be significant, and therefore the inclusion of sources of systematic errors is crucial for the assessment of the significance of the nested model component in practical applications. The methods proposed in this paper provide a simple and accurate means of including systematic errors for hypothesis testing of nested model components in a variety of applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the numerical stability of thermonuclear detonations in 1D accelerated reactive shocks and 2D binary collisions of equal-mass magnetized and unmagnetized white dwarf stars. To achieve high resolution at initiation sites, we devised geometric gridding and mesh velocity strategies specially adapted to the unique requirements of head-on collisional geometries, scenarios in which one expects maximum production of iron-group products. We study the effects of grid resolution and the limiting of temperature, energy generation, and reactants for different stellar masses, separations, magnetic fields, initial compositions, detonation mechanisms, and limiter parameters across a range of cell sizes from 1 to 100 km. Our results set bounds on the parameter space of limiter amplitudes for which both temperature- and energy-limiting procedures yield consistent and monotonically convergent solutions. Within these bounds, we find that grid resolutions of 5 km or better are necessary for uncertainties in total released energy and iron-group products to drop below 10%. Intermediate-mass products (e.g., calcium) exhibit similar convergence trends but with somewhat greater uncertainty. These conclusions apply equally to pure C/O white dwarfs, multispecies compositions (including helium shells), magnetized and unmagnetized cores, and either single or multiple detonation scenarios.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The removal of angular momentum from protostellar systems drives accretion onto the central star and may drive the dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Winds and jets can contribute to removing angular momentum from the disk, though the dominant process remains unclear. To date, observational studies of resolved disk winds have mostly targeted highly inclined disks. We report the detection of extended H2 and [Ne ii] emission toward the young stellar object SY Cha with the JWST Mid-InfraRed Instrument Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI-MRS). This is one of the first polychromatic detections of extended H2 toward a moderately inclined, i = 51 1, Class II source. We measure the semiopening angle of the H2 emission and build a rotation diagram to determine the H2 excitation temperature and abundance. We find a wide semiopening angle, high temperature, and low column density for the H2 emission, all of which are characteristic of a disk wind. We derive a molecular wind mass loss rate of 3 ± 2 × 10−9M⊙ yr−1, which is high compared to the previously derived stellar accretion rate of 6.6 × 10−10M⊙ yr−1. This suggests either that the stellar accretion and the disk wind are driven by different mechanisms or that accretion onto the star is highly variable. These observations demonstrate MIRI-MRS's utility in expanding studies of resolved disk winds beyond edge-on sources.

<title>Kinetic and Photochemical Disequilibrium in the Potentially Carbon-rich Atmosphere of the Warm Jupiter WASP-69 b</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
High-resolution transmission spectroscopy of the warm gas giant WASP-69 b has revealed the presence of H2O, CO, CH4, NH3, and C2H2 in its atmosphere. This study investigates the impact of vertical diffusion and photochemistry on its atmospheric composition, with a focus on the detected species plus HCN and CO2, to constrain the atmospheric C/O ratio. We utilize nonequilibrium gas-phase simulations to conduct a parameter study for vertical diffusion strength, local gas temperature, and C/O ratio. Our results indicate that a carbon-rich atmosphere enhances CH4 and C2H2 concentrations, while NH3 undergoes chemical conversion into HCN in carbon-rich, high-temperature environments. Consequently, HCN is abundantly produced in such atmospheres, though its strong spectral features remain undetected in WASP-69 b. Photochemical production of HCN and C2H2 is highly sensitive to vertical diffusion strength, with weaker diffusion resulting in higher concentrations. Cross-correlation of synthetic spectra with observed data shows that models with C/O = 2 best match observations, but models with C/O = 0.55 and 0.9 lead to statistically equivalent fits, leaving the C/O ratio unconstrained. We highlight the importance of accurately modeling NH3 quenching at pressures greater than 100 bars. Models for WASP-69 b capped at 100 bars bias cross-correlation fits toward carbon-rich values. We suggest that if the atmosphere of WASP-69 b is indeed carbon-rich with a solar metallicity, future observations should reveal the presence of HCN.

<title>Thermal Spectra of Warped and Broken Accretion Disks</title>

Black holes may accrete gas with angular momentum vectors misaligned with the black hole spin axis. The resulting accretion disks are subject to Lense–Thirring precession, and hence torque. Analytical calculations and simulations show that Lense–Thirring precession will warp, and, for large misalignments, fracture the disk. In GRMHD simulations, the warping or breaking occurs at ≲10 rs, where rs is the Schwarzschild radius. Considering that accretion disk spectra in the soft state of stellar-mass black holes are generally well modeled as multicolor blackbodies, the question arises as to how consistent warped and broken disks are with observations. Here, we analytically calculate thermal spectra of warped and broken disks with a warp or break radius at 10 rs for various disk inclinations. Due to self-irradiation and the projected area of the inclined disk regions, the spectra of inclined disks significantly deviate from multicolor blackbodies and do not follow the multicolor blackbody relation νLν ∝ νγ = ν4/3 at low frequencies ν. The power-law indices at low frequencies of the inclined disks vary with viewing angle; when viewed face-on, they vary between γ ≈ 0.91 and 1.26 for the warped disks and γ ≈ 1.37–1.54 for the broken disks depending on the inclination angle. The differences decrease when moving the location of the disk warp and break to larger radii; for inclined disks to emit as multicolor blackbodies, they must warp or break at radii ≥50 rs. Our results imply that accretion disks around black holes in the soft state warp or break at larger radii than suggested in GRHMD simulations.

<title>JWST, ALMA, and Keck Spectroscopic Constraints on the UV Luminosity Functions at z ∼ 7–14: Clumpiness and Compactness of the Brightest Galaxies in the Early Universe</title>

We present the number densities and physical properties of the bright galaxies spectroscopically confirmed at z ∼ 7–14. Our sample is composed of 60 galaxies at zspec ∼ 7–14, including recently confirmed galaxies at zspec = 12.34–14.18 with JWST, as well as new confirmations at zspec = 6.583–7.643 with −24 < MUV < −21 mag using ALMA and Keck. Our JWST/NIRSpec observations have also revealed that very bright galaxy candidates at z ∼ 10–13 identified from ground-based telescope images before JWST are passive galaxies at z ∼ 3–4, emphasizing the necessity of strict screening and spectroscopy in the selection of the brightest galaxies at z > 10. The UV luminosity functions derived from these spectroscopic results are consistent with a double power-law function, showing tensions with theoretical models at the bright end. To understand the origin of the overabundance of bright galaxies, we investigate their morphologies using JWST/NIRCam high-resolution images obtained in various surveys, including PRIMER and COSMOS-Web. We find that ∼70% of the bright galaxies at z ∼ 7 exhibit clumpy morphologies with multiple subcomponents, suggesting merger-induced starburst activity, which is consistent with SED fitting results showing bursty star formation histories. At z ≳ 10, bright galaxies are classified into two types of galaxies: extended ones with weak high-ionization emission lines, and compact ones with strong high-ionization lines including N iv]λ1486, indicating that at least two different processes (e.g., merger-induced starburst and compact star formation/AGN) are shaping the physical properties of the brightest galaxies at z ≳ 10 and are responsible for their overabundance.

Interplanetary (IP) shocks are one of the crucial dynamic phenomena in the heliosphere. They can accelerate particles to high energies, generate plasma waves, and trigger geomagnetic storms in Earth’s magnetosphere, significantly impacting technological infrastructure. In this study, two IP shock events are selected to study the temporal variations of the shock parameters using magnetometer and ion plasma measurements from STEREO-A and B, the Wind, Cluster fleet, and the Advanced Composition Explorer spacecraft. The shock normal vectors are determined using minimum variance analysis and magnetic coplanarity methods. During the 2007 May 7 event, the shock parameters and the shock normal direction remain consistent across each spacecraft crossing of the shock. The shock surface appears to be tilted by almost the same degree as the Parker spiral, and the driver could be a corotating interaction region (CIR). During the 2007 April 23 event, the shock parameters do not change significantly except for the shock angle θBn; however, the shape of the IP shock appears to be twisted in the direction perpendicular to the Sun–Earth line as well. The driver of this rippled shock is a stream interaction region/CIR as well.

<title>Understanding the Broad-line Region of Active Galactic Nuclei with Photoionization. I. The Moderate-accretion Regime</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada386</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Over three decades of reverberation mapping (RM) studies on local broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have measured reliable black hole (BH) masses for >100 AGNs. These RM measurements reveal a significant correlation between the Balmer broad-line region (BLR) size and AGN optical luminosity (the R–L relation). Recent RM studies for AGN samples with more diverse BH parameters (e.g., mass and Eddington ratio) reveal a substantial intrinsic dispersion around the average R–L relation, suggesting that variations in the broadband spectrum, driven by accretion parameters and other factors such as the cloud distribution and inclination, significantly influence the measured R–L relation. Here we perform a detailed photoionization investigation of expected broad-line properties as functions of accretion parameters using AGN continuum models from qsosed. We compare theoretical predictions with observations of a sample of 67 z ≲ 0.5 reverberation-mapped AGNs with rest-frame optical and UV spectra in the moderate-accretion regime (Eddington ratio λEdd ≡ L/LEdd < 0.5). The UV/optical line strengths and their dependences on accretion parameters are reasonably well reproduced by the locally optimally emitting cloud photoionization models. We provide quantitative recipes using optical/UV line flux ratios to infer the unobservable ionizing continuum. Additionally, photoionization models with universal values of ionization parameter ( ) and hydrogen density ( ) can qualitatively reproduce the observed global R–L relation for the current RM AGN sample. However, such models fail to reproduce the observed decrease in BLR size with increasing L/LEdd at fixed optical luminosity, implying that gas density or BLR structure may systematically change with accretion rate.

<title>CH3OH Thermal Lines Traces 6.7 GHz CH3OH Maser Variation of High-mass Protostar G353.273+0.641</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study reports an analysis of the 6.7 GHz CH3OH maser in the high-mass protostar G353.273+0.641 (G353), utilizing data from the Tianma Radio Telescope. G353 is a possibly periodic variation in the flux density of the maser with a period of ∼330 days. Our analysis of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array archival data identified 44 CH3OH transitions within the gas envelope surrounding the protostar. The CH3OH envelope exhibited non–local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) conditions during the increase phase of the flux density of the maser, then transitioning to LTE (T ∼ 380 K) during the decay phase of the maser. This phenomenon is likely attributed to the recurrent heating of the protostellar envelope through heat waves, which are generated by the periodic luminosity oscillations of the central high-mass protostar. The propagation velocity of the heat wave is gauged to be ∼0.02c. These results emphasize the significance of integrating the variations in 6.7 GHz CH3OH masers with their surrounding circumstellar environments to advance our comprehension of high-mass star formation mechanisms.

<title>ALMA FACTS. II. Large Scale Variations in the 12CO(J = 2 – 1) to 12CO(J = 1 – 0) Line Ratio in Nearby Galaxies</title>

We present 12CO(J = 1 – 0) mapping observations over ∼1/2 of the optical disk of 12 nearby galaxies from the Fundamental CO 1–0 Transition Survey of nearby galaxies (FACTS), using the ALMA Total Power array. Variations in the 12CO(J = 2 − 1)/12CO(J = 1 − 0) line ratio r21 are investigated. The luminosity-weighted r21 of the 11 sample galaxies ranges from 0.52 to 0.69 with an average of 0.61. We use position–velocity diagrams along the major axis and tilted ring models to separate the normal rotating galactic disk from kinematic outliers that deviate from pure circular rotation. We find that r21 is systematically higher in outliers compared to the disk. We compare r21 between SA, SAB, and SB galaxies, and find no significant difference in the average r21 depending on the presence of galactic bars. We find, however, that the radial gradient in r21 is bimodal, where a group containing all SA galaxies prefer constant or very shallow r21 gradients out to 40% of the optical radius, while another group containing all SB galaxies have a steep r21 gradient, decreasing by ∼20% before 40% of the optical radius, which also corresponds to the radius of the stellar bar. After this radius, these galaxies become consistent with a constant or shallow trend in r21. The large scale trend in r21 can have implications for how we interpret observations made solely in the 12CO(J = 2 − 1) line.

EUV brightenings are small-scale magnetic reconnection events that consistently appear before and after solar flares. However, it is not well understood how EUV precursors might foreshadow flares and what the physical connection is between the EUV signatures and flares. We studied flare-active and inactive periods in three separate studies using the Detection and EUV Flare Tracking (DEFT) tool. In Study 1, EUV signatures were identified in 200 no-flare days, in Study 2 EUV signatures before 360 flares were analyzed, and in Study 3 close to 36,000 EUV signatures were detected, and their pre- and postflare distribution and trends were studied. Our key questions were as follows: do EUV signatures occur consistently before flares, do EUV signatures occur without flares, are there flares without EUV precursors, and is it possible to forecast different magnitude flares based on preceding EUV signature trends? Study 1 showed that in no-flare periods EUV signatures were only detected 4% of the time. Study 2 showed that EUV precursors were present 92% of the time within 6 hr before ≥C-class flares. Study 3 showed that over 90% of the signatures were associated with flares (≥B class), and over 50% of all signatures were associated with ≥M-class flares. A superposed epoch analysis showed precursor frequency peaks at ∼70 and 100 minutes before M- and X-class flares, respectively, while B- and C-class flares had no notable precursor frequency peaks. These results demonstrate the close connection between EUV signatures and flares and the significant potential EUV signatures have in improving space weather forecasting.

<title>Baryon Pasting the Uchuu Light-cone Simulation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the Baryon Pasted (BP) X-ray and thermal Sunyaev–Zel’dovich (tSZ) maps derived from the half-sky Uchuu light-cone simulation. These BP-Uchuu maps are constructed using more than 75 million dark matter halos with masses M500c ≥ 1013 M⊙ within the redshift range 0 ≤ z ≤ 2. A distinctive feature of our BP-Uchuu light-cone maps is their capability to assess the influence of both extrinsic and intrinsic scatter caused by triaxial gaseous halos and internal gas characteristics, respectively, at the map level. We show that triaxial gas drives substantial scatter in X-ray luminosities of clusters and groups, accounting for nearly half of the total scatter in core-excised measurements. Additionally, scatter in the thermal pressure and gas density profiles of halos enhances the X-ray and SZ power spectra, leading to biases in cosmological parameter estimates. These findings are statistically robust due to the extensive sky coverage and large halo sample in the BP-Uchuu maps. The BP-Uchuu maps are publicly available online via Globus (https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=cf8dadb7-b6e9-4e2c-abc1-0813877efc13).

<title>Uncovering the Hidden Physical Structures and Protostellar Activities in the Low-metallicity S284-RE Region: Results from ALMA and JWST</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present an observational study of the S284-RE region, a low-metallicity area associated with the extended S284 H ii region. A thermally supercritical filament (mass ∼2402 M⊙ and length ∼8.5 pc) is investigated using the Herschel column density map. The Spitzer ratio 4.5 μm/3.6 μm map traces the H2 outflows in this filament, where previously reported young stellar objects (YSOs) are spatially distributed. Analysis of the YSO distribution has revealed three active star-forming clusters (YCl1, YCl2, and YCl3) within the filament. YCl3 seems to be the most evolved and YCl2 the youngest, while YCl1 displays signs of nonthermal fragmentation. The JWST (F470N+F444W)/F356W ratio map reveals at least seven bipolar H2 outflows, with four (olc1–olc4) in YCl1 and three (ol1–ol3) in YCl2. The driving sources of these outflows are identified based on outflow geometry, Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) continuum peaks, and YSO positions. Two ALMA continuum sources—#2 and #3—from the M–Reff plot are recognized as potential massive star formation candidates. ALMA continuum source #2 hosts at least three outflow-driving sources, whereas ALMA continuum source #3 contains two. The bipolar outflow olc1, driven by an embedded object within continuum source #2, is likely a massive protostar, as indicated by the Br-α and PAH emissions depicted in the JWST (F405N+F444W)/F356W ratio map. The presence of H2 knots in the outflows olc1 and ol1 suggests episodic accretion. Overall, the study investigates a massive protostar candidate, driving the ∼2.7 pc H2 outflow olc1 and undergoing episodic accretion.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a detailed analysis of an extragalactic slow classical nova in M31 exhibiting multiple peaks in its light curve. Spectroscopic and photometric observations were used to investigate the underlying physical processes. Shock-induced heating events resulting in the expansion and contraction of the photosphere are likely responsible for the observed multiple peaks. Deviation of the observed spectrum at the peak from the models also suggests the presence of shocks. The successive peaks occurring at increasing intervals could be due to the series of internal shocks generated near or within the photosphere. Spectral modeling suggests a low-mass white dwarf (WD) accreting slowly from a companion star. The ejecta mass, estimated from spectral analysis, is ~10−4 M⊙, which is typical for a slow nova. We estimate the binary, by comparing the archival Hubble Space Telescope data and eruption properties with stellar and nova models, to comprise a 0.65 M⊙ primary WD and a K iii cool evolved secondary star.

Blazars are a subclass of active galactic nuclei with relativistic jets pointing toward the observer. They are notable for their flux variability at all observed wavelengths and timescales. Together with simultaneous measurements at lower energies, the very-high-energy (VHE) emission observed during blazar flares may be used to probe the population of accelerated particles. However, optimally triggering observations of blazar high states can be challenging. Notable examples include identifying a flaring episode in real time and predicting VHE flaring activity based on lower-energy observables. For this purpose, we have developed a novel deep learning analysis framework, based on data-driven anomaly detection techniques. It is capable of detecting various types of anomalies in real-world, multiwavelength light curves, ranging from clear high states to subtle correlations across bands. Based on unsupervised anomaly detection and clustering methods, we differentiate source variability from noisy background activity, without the need for a labeled training data set of flaring states. The framework incorporates measurement uncertainties and is robust given data quality challenges, such as varying cadences and observational gaps. We evaluate our approach using both historical data and simulations of blazar light curves in two energy bands, corresponding to sources observable with the Fermi Large Area Telescope and the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory. In a statistical analysis, we show that our framework can reliably detect known historical flares.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using the semianalytic model Serotina, we investigate the cosmic spin evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) incorporating recent results from general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of spin-down from relativistic jets. We compare several variations of our model with compiled black hole (BH) spin measurements derived from X-ray reflection spectroscopy, correcting for a bias arising from the spin-dependent radiative efficiency of accretion flows. We show that the observed spin distribution is in agreement with a model that includes jet-driven spin-down, a key mechanism that acts to modulate spins across cosmic time at both high and very low specific accretion rates. The data also clearly prefer models with coherent accretion over models in which accretion disks rapidly switch from prograde to retrograde. We further predict spin distributions accessible via spatially resolved event horizons by the next-generation Event Horizon Telescope and Black Hole Explorer, as well as gravitational waves by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), each of which offers unique and distinct windows into the population of spinning BHs. Jet-driven spin-down is most strongly imprinted on the abundance of very highly spinning objects in our model. In addition, we show that the spin distribution sampled by LISA events may contain a signature of the natal spin distribution of heavy seeds, but not of light seeds, offering additional discrimination between these seeding pathways. Spin distributions from these future observed samples can be used to constrain the detailed physical properties of the accretion flow on horizon scales around SMBHs.

<title>Hooks, Lines, and Sinkers: How Active Galactic Nucleus Feedback and Cosmic-Ray Transport Shape the Far-infrared–Radio Correlation of Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The far-infrared–radio correlation (FRC) is one of the most promising empirical constraints on the role of cosmic rays (CRs) and magnetic fields in galaxy formation and evolution. While many theories have been proposed in order to explain the emergence and maintenance of the FRC across a gamut of galaxy properties and redshift, the nonlinear physics at play remain unexplored in full complexity and within a cosmological context. We present the first reproduction of the z ∼ 0 FRC using detailed synthetic observations of state-of-the-art cosmological zoom-in simulations from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE-3) suite with explicitly evolved CR proton and electron (CRe) spectra, for three models for CR transport and multichannel active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. In doing so, we generally verify the predictions of “calorimeter” theories at high FIR luminosities (L60 μm ≳ 109.5L⊙) and at low FIR luminosities (L60 μm ≲ 109.5L⊙), the so-called “conspiracy” of increasing UV radiation escape in tandem with increasing CRe escape, and find that the global FRC is insensitive to orders-of-magnitude locally variable CR transport coefficients. Importantly, the indirect effect of AGN feedback on emergent observables highlights novel interpretations of outliers in the FRC. In particular, we find that in many cases “radio-excess” objects can be better understood as “IR-dim” objects with longer-lived radio contributions at low z from Type Ia supernovae and intermittent black hole accretion in quenching galaxies, though this is sensitive to the interplay of CR transport and AGN feedback physics. This creates characteristic evolutionary tracks leading to the z = 0 FRC, which shape the subsequent late-time behavior of each model.

<title>The Disk Wind Contribution to the Gamma-Ray Emission from the Nearby Seyfert Galaxy GRS 1734−292</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Radio-quiet Seyfert galaxies have been detected in GeV gamma rays by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), but the origin of much of this emission is unclear. We consider the nearby example GRS 1734−292, which exhibits weak starburst and jet activities that are insufficient to explain the observed gamma-ray flux. With the first detailed multiwavelength study of this source, we demonstrate that an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk wind can account for its gamma-ray emission. Using a lepto-hadronic emission model based on a shocked ambient medium and a shocked wind region created by an AGN accretion disk wind, we identify two viable scenarios that are consistent with the Fermi-LAT data and multiwavelength observations: a hadronic pp-dominated scenario and a leptonic external-Compton-dominated scenario. Both of these show that future observations with the Cherenkov Telescope Array and the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory could detect TeV emission from a disk wind in GRS 1734−292. Such a detection would substantially improve our understanding of cosmic-ray acceleration efficiency in AGN disk wind systems and would establish radio-quiet Seyfert galaxies as cosmic-ray accelerators capable of reaching ultrahigh energies.

<title>Analytical and Numerical Methods for Circumbinary Disk Dynamics. II. Inclined Disks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To gain insight into the dynamical influence of a supermassive black hole binary on a circumbinary accretion disk, we investigate the binary and viscous torque densities throughout such a disk, with emphasis on the final density distribution, particularly the size and stability of the central gap between the binary and the inner edge of the disk. We limit ourselves to the simplified case of a massless viscous thin accretion disk under the influence of the gravitational potential from a binary system whose orbital plane is inclined relative to the disk. We employ two-dimensional Newtonian hydrodynamics simulations to examine the influence of two model parameters: the mass ratio of the binary and the inclination angle between the binary and the disk. We investigate their impact on the density and torque distribution. In our analytical approach, we consider the stability of epicycles induced by the perturbative effect of the asymmetric inclined binary gravitational potential on Keplerian circular orbits. Through our simulations, we observe that certain configurations never attain a quasi-steady state, where the density profile averaged over many orbits stabilizes. This instability occurs when the inclination is close to 45°. Furthermore, we identify configurations where there is never a persistent balance between the dynamical and viscous torque densities, as well as cases where the location of this balance oscillates or exhibits other time-dependent behavior over viscous timescales. These findings have implications for understanding both the expected gravitational-wave signal and electromagnetic counterparts from supermassive black hole binaries.

<title>Predicting Solar Energetic Particle Events with Time Series Shapelets</title>

Solar energetic particle (SEP) events pose significant risks to both space and ground-level infrastructure, as well as to human health in space. Understanding and predicting these events are critical for mitigating their potential impacts. In this paper, we address the challenge of predicting SEP events using proton flux data. We leverage some of the most recent advances in time series data mining, such as shapelets and the matrix profile, to propose a simple and easily understandable prediction approach. Our objective is to mitigate the interpretability challenges inherent to most machine learning models and to show that other methods exist that can not only yield accurate forecasts but also facilitate exploration and insight generation within the data domain. For this purpose, we construct a multivariate time series data set consisting of proton flux data recorded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's geosynchronous orbit Earth-observing satellite. Then, we use our proposed approach to mine shapelets and make predictions using a random forest classifier. We demonstrate that our approach rivals state-of-the-art SEP prediction, offering superior interpretability and the ability to predict SEP events before their parent eruptive flares.

<title>Spectral Variations across Latitudes on Asteroid (3200) Phaethon</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
3200 Phaethon is a near-Earth asteroid known to be actively emitting dust and gas when near its perihelion, and it is the target of the Japanese DESTINY+ mission. Several visible–near-IR spectra were obtained of Phaethon during 2003–2017, which have been collected together and analyzed with respect to its shape model. Using a thermal model, we examine the diurnal temperature variations across Phaethon’s surface (ΔT ∼ 600 K). We find different solar radiation heating between the north and south regions, with very high surface temperatures in the south region (max peak ∼ 1050 K), while a lower temperature is found in the north region (a mean value of 760 K). Our analysis of the photometrically corrected slope suggests a latitudinal trend in surface composition. We propose that the northern region of Phaethon may be linked to unusual chondrites and naturally heated Y-82162 samples (63–125 μm and/or chips), while the southern region shows similarities to Ivuna CI chondrites heated to 700°C (0–125 μm). The equatorial region appears to include a mixture of materials from both hemispheres.

<title>Tracing the Winds: A Uniform Interpretation of Helium Escape in Exoplanets from Archival Spectroscopic Observations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Over the past decade, observations of evaporating exoplanets have become increasingly common, driven by the discovery of the near-infrared helium-triplet line as a powerful probe of atmospheric escape. This process significantly influences the evolution of exoplanets, particularly those smaller than Jupiter. Both theoretical and observational studies have aimed to determine how efficiently exoplanets convert their host star's X-ray and ultraviolet (XUV) radiation into atmospheric mass loss. In this study, we employ the open-source atmospheric escape model p-winds to systematically analyze all publicly available helium triplet spectroscopic detections related to exoplanetary atmospheric escape. Our findings indicate that the retrieved outflows strongly depend on the ratio of XUV flux to planetary density (FXUV/ρp), supporting the theoretical framework of energy-limited mass loss. We constrain population-level photoevaporative efficiencies to 0.34 ± 0.13 and 0.75 ± 0.21 for hydrogen-helium fractions of 0.90 and 0.99, respectively. These results offer new insights into exoplanetary atmospheric evolution and will aid future studies on exoplanet population demographics.

<title>PSR J1947−1120: A New Huntsman Millisecond Pulsar Binary</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the discovery of PSR J1947–1120, a new huntsman millisecond pulsar with a red giant companion star in a 10.3 day orbit. This pulsar was found via optical, X-ray, and radio follow-up of the previously unassociated γ-ray source 4FGL J1947.6–1121. PSR J1947–1120 is the second confirmed pulsar in the huntsman class and establishes this as a bona fide subclass of millisecond pulsars. We use MESA models to show that huntsman pulsars can be naturally explained as neutron star binaries whose secondaries are currently in the “red bump” region of the red giant branch, temporarily underfilling their Roche lobes and hence halting mass transfer. Huntsman pulsars offer a new view of the formation of typical millisecond pulsars, allowing novel constraints on the efficiency of mass transfer and recycling at an intermediate stage in the process.

<title>No Galaxy-scale [C ii] Fast Outflow in the z = 6.72 Red Quasar HSC J1205–0000</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
HSC 120505.09-000027.9 (J1205–0000) is one of the highest redshift (z = 6.72) dust-reddened quasars (red quasars) known to date. We present an improved analysis of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array data of the [C ii] 158 μm line and the underlying rest-frame far-infrared (FIR) continuum emission, previously reported in T. Izumi et al. (2021b), toward J1205–0000. Red quasars are thought to be a transitional phase from an obscured starburst to a luminous blue quasar, in some cases associated with massive outflows driven by the active galactic nucleus (AGN). J1205–0000 has a high FIR luminosity, LFIR = 2.5 × 1012 L⊙ and a total IR luminosity of LTIR = 3.5 × 1012 L⊙, corresponding to a star formation rate of ∼528 M⊙ yr−1. With the [C ii]-based dynamical mass of ∼1 × 1011 M⊙, we conclude that J1205–0000 is hosted by a starburst galaxy. In contradiction to T. Izumi et al., our improved analysis shows no hint of a broad component in the [C ii] line spectrum. Thus there is no evidence for a host galaxy-scale fast [C ii] outflow, despite the fact that J1205–0000 has fast nuclear ionized outflows seen in the rest-frame UV. We explore several scenarios for this discrepancy (e.g., the early phase of AGN feedback, reliability of the [C ii] line as a tracer of outflows), and we claim that it is still too early to conclude that there is no significant negative AGN feedback on star formation in this red quasar.

<title>Star Formation in the Lopsided Galaxy Arp 291</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adab73</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have investigated the star formation process taking place in the lopsided galaxy Arp 291, based on narrowband images in the Hα, [N ii]λ6583, and [O iii]λ5007 emission lines, obtained using the modern tunable photometer MaNGaL at the Caucasus Mountain Observatory. We have diagnosed 30 star-forming (SF) regions by means of the Baldwin–Phillips–Terlevich method. The oxygen abundance of the ionized gas in the SF regions varies in the range from 8.17 ± 0.04 to 8.47 ± 0.16 dex, which is typical for spiral and irregular galaxies, and shows an anticorrelation with the surface density of current star formation rates. Star formation in the lopsided galaxy Arp 291 occurs in separate clumps comparable in size to those observed in spiral and lenticular galaxies, at a rate typical for these types of galaxies. The clumps of current star formation are located irregularly in the distorted spiral arms of Arp 291. Possible causes of lopsidedness of the galaxy are discussed.

<title>Observing Supernova Neutrino Light Curves with Super-Kamiokande. V. Distance Estimation with Neutrinos</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Neutrinos are pivotal signals in multimessenger observations of supernovae (SNe). Recent advancements in the analysis method of supernova (SN) neutrinos, especially in quantitative analysis, have significantly broadened scientific possibilities. This study demonstrates the feasibility of estimating distances to SNe using neutrinos. This estimation utilizes the direct relationship between the radius of a neutron star (NS) and the distance to the supernova, which is analogous to main-sequence fitting. The radius of an NS is determined with an approximate uncertainty of 10% through observations such as X-rays and gravitational waves. By integrating this information, the distance to the supernova can be estimated with an uncertainty of within 15% at a 95% confidence level. It has been established that neutrinos can pinpoint the direction of supernovae, and when combined with distance estimates, three-dimensional localization becomes achievable. This capability is vital for follow-up observations using multimessenger approaches. Moreover, more precise distance determinations to SNe through follow-up observations, such as optical observations, allow for accurate measurements of neutron-star radii. This data, via the neutron-star mass–radius relationship, could provide various insights into nuclear physics.

<title>Solar Modulation of AMS-02 Daily Proton and Helium Fluxes with Modified Force-field Approximation Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
As galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) propagate through the turbulent plasma environment within the heliosphere, they undergo a process of diffusion, drift, and energy loss, leading to a notable reduction in their flux. This is the solar modulation impact. Recently, the cosmic-ray experiment AMS-02 published daily fluxes of proton and helium for the period from 2011 May 20 to 2019 October 29 in the rigidity interval from about 1 to 100 GV, exhibiting fine time structures that correlate with solar wind properties on a daily basis. In this work, we employ three different modified force field approximation models to fit the data. By fitting to the daily proton and helium fluxes, we get the time series of solar modulation potential. We find good agreement of data and model predictions for both proton and helium with the same parameters in two modified force field approximation models. The results in this study verify that the modified force-field approximation model is a valid parameterization of the GCR spectrum also at daily timescales.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Named for orbital kinship with Pluto, the Plutinos are a prominent group of Kuiper Belt objects whose orbital periods are in libration about a 3/2 ratio with Neptune’s. We investigate the long-term orbital dynamics of known Plutinos, with attention to the additional libration (or lack thereof) of their argument of perihelion, g, a well-known characteristic of Pluto’s orbit. We show that the g librators among the Plutinos cluster around an arc in the eccentricity–inclination parameter plane. This previously unreported dynamical structure is owed to a family of periodic orbits of the third kind in the restricted problem of three bodies, identified by Poincaré at the end of the 19th century. Approximately 16% of the currently known Plutinos exhibit g librations, a far greater fraction than the ratios of the associated libration frequencies. These results may offer new constraints for theoretical models of the dynamical history of the Plutinos and of the orbital migration history of the giant planets.

<title>Intrinsic Pulse Widths of FRB 20121102A and Calculation of Broadening from Propagation and Instrumental Effects</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The pulse widths of fast radio bursts are always broadened due to the scattering of the plasma medium through which the electromagnetic wave passes. The recorded pulse width will be further affected by the radio telescopes since the sampling time and the bandwidth cannot be infinitely small. In this study, we focus on the pulse widths of at least 3287 bursts detected from FRB 20121102A as of 2023 October. Various effects such as the scattering broadening, the redshift-induced broadening, and the instrumental broadening are examined. At a redshift of 0.193, the pulse width is broadened by a factor of approximately 0.16 due to cosmological time dilation. It is found that the instrumental broadening only contributes a fraction of 10−3–10−1 to the observed pulse width. The scattering broadening is even smaller, which constitutes a tiny fraction of 10−5–10−2 in the observed pulse width. After correcting for these broadenings, the intrinsic pulse width is derived for each burst. The maximum and minimum pulse widths at different frequencies are highlighted. The intrinsic widths of most bursts are in a narrow range of 1–10 ms, which leads to a quasi-linear correlation between the fluence and the peak flux. Additionally, the mean value and the dispersion range of intrinsic pulse width are found to scale with the central frequency as ν−1.2±0.2 and ν−1.7±0.6, respectively.

<title>Testing the Flux Rope Paradigm for Coronal Mass Ejections Using a Three-spacecraft Encounter Event</title>

We present a 3D morphological and field reconstruction of a coronal mass ejection (CME) from 2023 November 28, which hits three spacecraft near 1 au: Wind at Earth’s L1 Lagrange point, STEREO-A with a longitudinal separation of 6 5 west of Earth, and Solar Orbiter (SolO) at 10 7 east of Earth. The reconstruction assumes a magnetic flux rope (MFR) structure for the CME. With this event, we test whether field tracings observed by a spacecraft passing near the central axis of a CME MFR (STEREO-A) can be used to successfully predict the field behavior seen by a spacecraft 17∘ away (SolO), which has a more grazing encounter with the CME. We find that the MFR model does have significant success in simultaneously reproducing the field signs and rotations seen at STEREO-A, Wind, and SolO. This provides support for the MFR paradigm for CME structure. However, the SolO measurements, which are farthest from the central axis of the MFR, show less defined MFR signatures, presumably due to a greater degree of erosion and degradation of the MFR structure far from its central axis.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
For the first time, we reveal the distribution of plasma density, electron temperature, thermal pressure, and total pressure around a reconnection X-line, by using the spiral CT scan technique, which is a novel technique analogous to that in the hospital. This X-line was detected by the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft and has been widely believed to host a non-guide-field reconnection in previous studies. With the help of such an advanced technique, we find that (1) the plasma density is low on the magnetosphere side but high on the magnetosheath side; (2) the electron temperature is high on the magnetosphere side but low on the magnetosheath side; (3) the thermal pressure is high near the current sheet but low away from the current sheet; (4) the total pressure in the inflow region is higher than near the current sheet. Among these findings, the first three agree with classical theories, hence validating our novel scan technique; the last one implicates that antiparallel magnetic field lines were being pushed together and the reconnection process was ongoing.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A coronal mass ejection (CME) and post-CME blob phenomena in the solar atmosphere, associated with shear flow and convergent flow perturbations in the photosphere, are investigated using a resistive two-fluid (electron–ion) code. It is found that there are notable deviations between the two-fluid and previous magnetohydrodynamic simulations. In this two-fluid approach, the decoupling motions of ions and electrons leads to the emergence of an additional electric field. With expansion of a magnetic arcade associated with the footpoint shear flows, a thin current sheet is formed and a series of magnetic reconnections occurs in the lower region of the central magnetic arcade. The initial reconnection gives rise to a rising magnetic island, displaying typical CME characteristics. Subsequent reconnections produce smaller, more rapidly ascending blobs. These smaller blobs ultimately merge with the primary CME core, thereby accelerating its ascent.

<title>Shaping Outflows and Jets by Ambient Pressure: A Unified Framework</title>

Astrophysical outflows are ubiquitous across cosmic scales, from stellar to galactic systems. While diverse launching mechanisms have been proposed, we demonstrate that these outflows share a fundamental commonality: their morphology follows the physics of pressure-confined supersonic flows. By extending classical de Laval nozzle theory to account for ambient pressure gradients, we present a unified framework that successfully describes outflows from young stellar objects to active galactic nuclei. This simplified approach, compared to full magnetohydrodynamic treatments, captures the essential physics governing outflow shapes across different scales. Our model reveals a remarkable consistency of pressure profiles, characterized by a power-law exponent near “–2” across 6 orders of magnitude in spatial scale, independent of the internal characteristics of the outflow or the nature of the central engine. This discovery suggests a universal mechanism for outflow collimation and acceleration, bridging the gap between theoretical models and observational features across a wide range of astronomical scales.

<title>Study of Long-term Spectral Evolution and X-Ray and γ-Ray Correlation of Blazars Seen by HAWC</title>

The HAWC Observatory collected 6 yr of extensive data, providing an ideal platform for long-term monitoring of blazars in the very high energy (VHE) band, without bias toward specific flux states. HAWC continuously monitors blazar activity at TeV energies, focusing on sources with a redshift of z ≤ 0.3, based on the Third Fermi-LAT Catalog of High-Energy sources. We specifically focused our analysis on Mrk 421 and Mrk 501, as they are the brightest blazars observed by the HAWC Observatory. With a data set of 2143 days, this work significantly extends the monitoring previously published, which was based on 511 days of observation. By utilizing HAWC data for the VHE γ-ray emission in the 300 GeV–100 TeV energy range, in conjunction with Swift-XRT data for the 0.3–10 keV X-ray emission, we aim to explore potential correlations between these two bands. For Mrk 501, we found evidence of a long-term correlation. Additionally, we identified a period in the light curve where the flux was very low for more than 2 yr. On the other hand, our analysis of Mrk 421 measured a strong linear correlation for quasi-simultaneous observations collected by HAWC and Swift-XRT. This result is consistent with a linear dependence and a multiple-zone synchrotron self-Compton model to explain the X-ray and γ-ray emission. Finally, as suggested by previous findings, we confirm a harder-when-brighter behavior in the spectral evolution of the flux properties for Mrk 421. These findings contribute to the understanding of blazar emissions and their underlying mechanisms.

We extend the spherical tensorial formalism for polarization to the treatment of electric and magnetic multipole transitions of any order. We rely on the spherical-wave expansion to derive the tensor form of the operator describing the interaction of the atomic system with a polarized radiation field, which naturally leads to the introduction of spherical tensors describing the polarization properties of the interacting field. As a direct application, the formalism is used to model the radiation anisotropy affecting the scattering of radiation in an electric quadrupole transition and the associated Hanle effect in the presence of a magnetic field.

<title>Tackling the Problem of Distributional Shifts: Correcting Misspecified, High-dimensional Data-driven Priors for Inverse Problems</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b92</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Bayesian inference for inverse problems hinges critically on the choice of priors. In the absence of specific prior information, population-level distributions can serve as effective priors for parameters of interest. With the advent of machine learning, the use of data-driven population-level distributions (encoded, e.g., in a trained deep neural network) as priors is emerging as an appealing alternative to simple parametric priors in a variety of inverse problems. However, in many astrophysical applications it is often difficult or even impossible to acquire independent and identically distributed samples from the underlying data-generating process of interest to train these models. In these cases, corrupted data or a surrogate, e.g., a simulator, is often used to produce training samples, meaning that there is a risk of obtaining misspecified priors. This, in turn, can bias the inferred posteriors in ways that are difficult to quantify, which limits the potential applicability of these models in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose addressing this issue by iteratively updating the population-level distributions by retraining the model with posterior samples from different sets of observations, and we showcase the potential of this method on the problem of background image reconstruction in strong gravitational lensing when score-based models are used as data-driven priors. We show that, starting from a misspecified prior distribution, the updated distribution becomes progressively closer to the underlying population-level distribution, and the resulting posterior samples exhibit reduced bias after several updates.

<title>Investigating the Efficacy of Topologically Derived Time Series for Flare Forecasting. I. Data Set Preparation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The accurate forecasting of solar flares is considered a key goal within the solar physics and space weather communities. There is significant potential for flare prediction to be improved by incorporating topological fluxes of magnetogram data sets, without the need to invoke three-dimensional magnetic field extrapolations. Topological quantities such as magnetic helicity and magnetic winding have shown significant potential toward this aim, and provide spatiotemporal information about the complexity of active region magnetic fields. This study develops time series that are derived from the spatial fluxes of helicity and winding that show significant potential for solar flare prediction. It is demonstrated that time-series signals, which correlate with flare onset times, also exhibit clear spatial correlations with eruptive activity, establishing a potential causal relationship. A significant database of helicity and winding fluxes and associated time series across 144 active regions is generated using Space-Weather HMI Active Region Patches data processed with the Active Region Topology (or ARTop) code that forms the basis of the time-series and spatial investigations conducted here. We find that a number of time series in this data set often exhibit extremal signals that occur 1–8 hr before a flare. This publicly available living data set will allow users to incorporate these data into their own flare prediction algorithms.

<title>Tracking Star-forming Cores as Mass Reservoirs in Clustered and Isolated Regions Using Numerical Passive Tracer Particles</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Understanding the physical properties of star-forming cores as mass reservoirs for protostars and the impact of turbulence is crucial in star formation studies. We implemented passive tracer particles in clump-scale numerical simulations with turbulence strengths of . Unlike core identification methods used in observational studies, we identified 260 star-forming cores using a new method based on tracer particles falling onto protostars. Our findings reveal that star-forming cores do not necessarily coincide with high-density regions when nearby stars are present, as gas selectively accretes onto protostars, leading to clumpy, fragmented structures. We calculated convex hull cores from star-forming cores and defined their filling factors. Regardless of turbulence strength, convex hull cores with lower filling factors tend to contain more protostars and have larger masses and sizes, indicating that cores in clustered regions are more massive and larger than those in isolated regions. Thus, the filling factor serves as a key indicator for distinguishing between isolated and clustered star-forming regions and may provide insights into the star formation processes within clustered regions. We also found that most convex hull cores are gravitationally bound. However, in the model, there are more low-mass, unbound convex hull cores compared to the model. In the model, 16% of the convex hull cores are unbound, which may be explained by the inertial-inflow model. These findings highlight the influence of turbulence strength on the mass and gravitational stability of cores.

<title>Fluctuations Driven by Multicomponent Pickup Ion Distributions in the Outer Heliosheath</title>

The stability of a realistic multicomponent pickup ion (PUI) velocity distribution derived from a global model of neutral atoms in the heliosphere, which treats hydrogen and helium atoms self-consistently and includes equations for electrons and helium ions, is investigated using linear instability analysis and hybrid simulations. Linear instability analysis shows that the excited oblique mirror waves and the parallel/quasi-parallel Alfvén-cyclotron (AC) waves have lower growth rates than those obtained previously by A. Mousavi et al. for the PUI velocity distributions given by J. Heerikhuisen et al. The PUI scattering by each of the two modes alone is studied. In contrast to the previous investigations, our current simulations using the updated realistic distributions indicate that mirror waves alone do not effectively scatter PUIs in pitch angle. Instead, they primarily contribute to reducing the thermal spread anisotropy of the PUIs originating from the neutral solar wind. The unstable AC waves exhibit lower growth rates but higher saturation levels than the mirror waves. Two-dimensional (2D) simulation results show that when all unstable waves are present, the predominant contributor to the fluctuating magnetic field energy is the AC mode. The AC waves quickly scatter the PUIs with pitch angles away from 90∘ toward isotropy, while the PUIs near 90∘ pitch angle maintain a degree of anisotropy within our simulation timeframe. Moreover, several 1D and 2D hybrid simulations with different numbers of particles per cell are performed to examine the impact of numerical noise on PUI scattering. Finally, the implications of these results for the Interstellar Boundary Explorer energetic neutral atom ribbon are discussed.

<title>Laboratory Measurement of CH3 17OH Transitions in the Frequency Range from 216 to 264 GHz for Astronomical Application</title>

Methanol is one of the most abundant complex organic molecules in interstellar environments. Molecular lines of its rare isotopologues 12CH317OH and 12CH318OH therefore play a crucial role in examining the column density of 12CH316OH, which serves as a reference for organic molecular chemistry in interstellar clouds. In this study, we have recorded the spectroscopic emission spectrum of 12CH317OH in the frequency range between 216 and 264 GHz by making use of an emission-type millimeter and submillimeter spectrometer. We have specifically paid attention to the Q-branch transitions, which are the strongest line series in this frequency region. Among the stable oxygen isotopes, 16O, 17O, and 18O of methanol, only 12CH317OH obviously shows line profiles having double and/or triple peaks in low-J transitions, due to the nuclear quadrupole interaction. The newly obtained 12CH317OH data will play an important role in facilitating a deeper understanding of the organic chemistry related to star and planet formation. The 12CH317OH line data allow us to trace and constrain the isotopic ratio 17O/18O in methanol, which is efficient to investigate the galactic-scale evolution of elements. In addition, we also assigned some transitions of 13CH317OH in the recorded spectrum.

<title>Formation of Stripped Stars from Stellar Collisions in Galactic Nuclei</title>

Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are an important way to probe the properties of stellar populations surrounding supermassive black holes. The observed spectra of several TDEs, such as ASASSN-14li, show high nitrogen-to-carbon (N/C) abundance ratios, leading to questions about their progenitors. Disrupting an intermediate- or high-mass star that has undergone CNO processing, increasing the nitrogen in its core, could lead to an enhanced nitrogen TDE. Galactic nuclei present a conducive environment for high-velocity stellar collisions that can lead to high mass loss, stripping the carbon- and hydrogen-rich envelopes of the stars and leaving behind the enhanced nitrogen cores. TDEs of these stripped stars may therefore exhibit even more extreme nitrogen enhancement. Using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code StarSmasher, we provide a parameter space study of high-velocity stellar collisions involving intermediate-mass stars, analyzing the composition of the collision products. We conclude that high-velocity stellar collisions can form products that have abundance ratios similar to those observed in the motivating TDEs. Furthermore, we show that stars which have not experienced high CNO processing can yield low-mass collision products that retain even higher N/C abundance ratios. We analytically estimate the mass fallback for a typical TDE of several collision products to demonstrate consistency between our models and TDE observations. Lastly, we discuss how the extended collision products, with high central to average density ratios, can be related to repeated partial TDEs like ASASSN-14ko and G objects in the Galactic center.

<title>Synthetic Modeling of Polarized Dust Emission in Intermediate-mass YSOs. I. Constraining the Role of Iron Inclusions and Inelastic Relaxation on Grain Alignment with ALMA Polarization</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada3cf</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Iron inclusions embedded inside dust grains play a crucial role in both internal alignment (IA) via Barnett relaxation and external alignment via the MAgnetically Enhanced RAdiative Torque (MRAT) mechanism. Moreover, inelastic relaxation is predicted to dominate over Barnett relaxation in driving the IA of micron-sized grains and very large grains (VLGs) above 10 μm. Yet, a detailed modeling of polarized thermal dust emission from Class 0/I young stellar objects (YSOs) taking into account these effects and their observational constraints is still lacking. In this paper, we update the POLARIS code and use it to perform synthetic dust polarization modeling for MHD simulations of an intermediate-mass YSOs. Results will be post-processed with CASA to confront Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) polarimetric observations. We found that to reproduce the high polarization degree of p ∼ 5%–30% observed in protostellar envelopes by ALMA, micron-sized grains and VLGs must contain iron inclusions with Ncl ∼ 5–103 iron atoms per cluster, assuming 30% of iron abundance locked inside dust grains under the cluster form. Inside the inner ∼500 au region, inelastic relaxation must participate in driving the grain IA, and grains must contain larger iron inclusions of Ncl ∼ 102–104 and grow beyond ≥10 μm to reproduce ∼3%–10% of dust polarization observed by ALMA. But given such a combination, the IA and MRAT efficiency acting on VLGs still decreases toward the center, inducing the decrease of p(%) with increasing gas density, reaching p ∼ 1% inside the disk.

<title>Minor-merger-induced Star Formation Rejuvenation in an Elliptical Radio-loud Quasar Host, 3C 59</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada033</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada033</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report a rare case where an elliptical radio-loud quasar host, 3C 59, rejuvenates star formation activity through minor mergers with its nearby satellite galaxies. The inferred star formation history of 3C 59 has shown significant star formation rejuvenation within the past 500 Myr, before which it remained rather quiescent for most of the cosmic time. The three nearest satellite galaxies of 3C 59 exhibit significant morphological disturbances, and two of them present strong tidal tails pointing toward 3C 59. In addition, all the satellite galaxies within a projected distance of 200 kpc show low star formation activities. They also have systematically lower effective radius (Re) than local late-type galaxies, while 3C 59 has significantly larger Re than both early- and late-type galaxies. All these features suggest that ongoing minor mergers between 3C 59 and its nearby satellites could be causing gas to flow into 3C 59, which induces the star formation rejuvenation and possibly also triggers the quasar activity. The enormous power from the large-scale radio jet of 3C 59 may in turn help keep the halo hot, prevent gas cooling, and further reduce star formation in its satellite galaxies. These results provide important insights into the mass and size growth of central galaxies and star formation quenching of satellite galaxies in galaxy groups.

<title>Solar Modulation of Low-energy Cosmic-Ray Nitrogen and Its Comparison with Oxygen</title>

The heliospheric environment is very complex and filled with diverse high-energy particles from various origins, and among these particles, cosmic rays (CRs), including anomalous and Galactic components (ACRs and GCRs), are unique as they originate from beyond the solar system. Due to their stable and long-lasting presence in the heliosphere, the study of CRs is crucial for protecting humanity and other lifeforms against the hazards of high-energy radiation. In this work, we aim to study the prolonged changes in CR nitrogen, a fundamental element that constitutes amino acids, using the measurements from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft. The comparison of solar modulation on CR nitrogen and oxygen is also made using the yearly averaged ACE observations. The ACR nitrogen has a more even spectrum than ACR oxygen while the spectrum of GCR nitrogen is more abrupt than GCR oxygen. Further model results indicate that GCR nitrogen and oxygen undergo comparable modulation processes within the heliosphere and the slight difference between the observed power-law indices of nitrogen and oxygen spectrum is due to the distinct local interstellar spectrum of the two species. Besides, an analysis is made to explain the observed more flattened ACR spectrum of nitrogen than oxygen caused by the slightly different charge-to-mass ratio Z/A.

<title>Cluster Candidates with Massive Quiescent Galaxies at z ∼ 2</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Galaxy clusters are crucial to understanding the role of the environment in galaxy evolution. However, due to their rarity, only a limited number of clusters have been identified at z ≳ 2. In this paper, we report a discovery of seven cluster candidates with massive quiescent galaxies at z ∼ 2 in the 3.5 deg2 area of the XMM Large Scale Structure field, roughly doubling the known cluster sample at this frontier redshift if confirmed. We construct a photometric redshift catalog based on deep (i ∼ 26, Ks ∼ 24) multiwavelength photometry from the u* band to the K band gathered from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program and other collaborative/public surveys. We adopt a Gaussian kernel density estimate with two different spatial scales (10″ and 60″) to draw a density map of massive ( ) and quiescent ( ) galaxies at z ∼ 2. Then, we identify seven prominent overdensities. These candidates show clear red sequences in color–magnitude diagrams (z − H versus H). Moreover, one of them shows an extended X-ray emission with LX = (1.46 ± 0.35) × 1044 erg s−1, suggesting its virialized nature. There is no clear evidence of enhancement nor suppression of the star formation rate of the main-sequence galaxies in the clusters. We find that cluster galaxies have a higher fraction of transition population with (12%) than the field (2%), which implies the ongoing star formation quenching. The quiescent fraction in the cluster candidates also exceeds that in the field. We confirm that the excess of a quiescent fraction is larger for higher-mass galaxies. This is the first statistical evidence for the mass-dependent environmental quenching at work in clusters even at z ∼ 2.

<title>Assessing the Impact of Binary Systems on Microlensing Using SPISEA and PopSyCLE Population Simulations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Gravitational microlensing provides a unique opportunity to probe the mass distribution of stars, black holes, and other objects in the Milky Way. Population simulations are necessary to interpret results from microlensing surveys. The contribution from binary objects is often neglected or minimized in analysis of observations and simulations despite the high percentage of binary systems and microlensing's ability to probe binaries. To simulate the population effects, we added multiple systems to Stellar Population Interface for Stellar Evolution and Atmospheres (SPISEA), which simulates stellar clusters. We then inject these multiples into Population Synthesis for Compact-object Lensing Events (PopSyCLE), which simulates Milky Way microlensing surveys. When making OGLE observational selection criteria, we find that 55% of observed microlensing events involve a binary system. Specifically, 14.5% of events have a multiple lens and a single source, 31.7% have a single lens and a multiple source, and 8.8% have a multiple lens and a multiple source. The majority of these events have photometric light curves that appear single and are fit well by a single-lens, single-source model. This suggests that binary source and binary lens−binary source models should be included more frequently in event analysis. The mean Einstein crossing time shifts from 19.1 days for single events only to 21.3 days for single and multiple events, after cutting binary events with multiple peaks. The Einstein crossing time distribution of single and single-peaked multiple events is better aligned with observed distributions from OGLE than singles alone, indicating that multiple systems are a significant missing piece between simulations and reality.

<title>Dust Dynamics in Radially Convective Regions of Protoplanetary Disks</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adabe6</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Hydrodynamic instabilities likely operate in protoplanetary disks. One candidate, convective overstability (COS), can be triggered in regions with a negative radial entropy gradient. The ensuing turbulence and flow structures are expected to affect dust dynamics directly. We revisit the interaction between dust and the COS with high-resolution spectral simulations in the unstratified, axisymmetric Boussinesq shearing box framework. We find zonal flows, or pressure bumps, formed by the COS trap dust, as expected, but dust densities increase at most by a factor of O(10) over its background value due to the zonal flows’ unsteady nature. Furthermore, dust feedback can impede the formation of zonal flows, even at small dust-to-gas ratios ϵ ∼ O(0.1). We interpret this phenomenon as a competition between the negative gas angular momentum flux associated with zonal flow formation and the positive dust angular momentum flux associated with its drift toward pressure maxima. Dust concentration significantly weakens when a large-scale radial pressure gradient induces a background dust drift. Ultimately, we find that dust concentration by COS-induced zonal flows is limited to ϵ ≲ 1. Whether this can be improved under more realistic geometries must be addressed with stratified and full 3D simulations at equivalent resolutions.

<title>Constraints on the Variation of the Fine-structure Constant at 3 < z < 10 with JWST Emission-line Galaxies</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adad5b</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present constraints on the spacetime variation of the fine-structure constant α at redshifts 2.5 ≤ z < 9.5 using JWST emission-line galaxies (ELGs). The galaxy sample consists of 621 high-quality spectra with strong and narrow [O iii] λλ4959,5007 doublet emission lines from 578 galaxies, including 232 spectra at z > 5. The [O iii] doublet lines are arguably the best emission lines to probe the variation in α. We divide our sample into six subsamples based on redshift and calculate the relative variation Δα/α for the individual subsamples. The calculated Δα/α values are consistent with zero within 1σ at all redshifts, suggesting no time variation in α above a level of (1–2) × 10−4 (1σ) in the past 13.2 billion yr. When the whole sample is combined, the constraint is improved to be Δα/α = (0.2 ± 0.7) × 10−4. We further test the spatial variation in α using four subsamples of galaxies in four different directions on the sky. The measured Δα/α values are consistent with zero at a 1σ level of ∼2 × 10−4. While the constraints in this work are not as stringent as those from lower-redshift quasar absorption lines in previous studies, this work uses an independent tracer and provides the first constraints on Δα/α at the highest redshifts. With the growing number of ELGs from JWST, we expect to achieve stronger constraints in the future.

Slitless (or wide-field) imaging spectroscopy provides simultaneous imaging and spectral information from a wide field of view, allowing for rapid spectroscopic data collection from extended sources. Depending on the size of the extended source, combined with the spatial resolution and spectral dispersion of the instrument, there may be locations in the focal plane where spectral lines from different spatial locations overlap on the detector. An unfolding method is successfully developed and demonstrated on the recent rocket flight of the Marshall Grazing Incidence X-ray Spectrometer, which observed several strong emission lines in the 8–30 Å wavelength range from two X-ray bright points and a portion of an active region. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of the parameters that control and optimize the inversion method for unfolding slitless spectrograph data.

<title>The Timing and Spectral Properties of the 2022 Outburst of SGR J1935+2154 Observed with NICER</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The magnetar SGR J1935+2154 entered a new active episode on 2022 October 10, with X-ray bursts and enhanced persistent emission. At the tail of a high burst rate interval, lasting several hours, radio bursts were detected, revealing the connection between the X-ray activities and radio emissions. We analyzed observations of SGR J1935+2154 for nearly 3 months, using data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer. We report the timing and spectral results following the onset of this outburst. In general, the X-ray flux of the persistent emission decays exponentially. While a flare is evident on the light curve, a fast radio burst (FRB) was detected immediately following the peak of this flare. We found a phase jump in the pulse profile, with a deviation of a 0.16 ± 0.03 phase, which is related to the glitch. The spectra are well fit with the combination of a blackbody and a power-law (PL) model. The decay of the outburst is dominated by the drop in the nonthermal component, which also leads to an increase in thermal proportion. The photon index of the PL is inversely correlated with both the unabsorbed flux and the burst rate. We find that unlike the large variety of the persistent emission around FRB 221014, the X-ray properties are very stable when FRBs 221021 and 221201 happened. These results manifest the connection between the glitch, phase jump, X-ray burst, and radio burst, crucial for studying the mutation in twisted magnetic fields and constraining the trigger mechanism of radio bursts.

<title>Modeling the Saddle-like GeV–TeV Spectrum of HESS J1809–193: Gamma Rays Arising from Reverse-shocked Pulsar Wind Nebula?</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada93e</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada93e</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The evolution of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) could be expected to leave imprints in gamma rays. We suggest that the intriguing GeV–TeV spectral energy distribution (SED) of HESS J1809–193 and Fermi-LAT source J1810.3–1925e is very likely to be the gamma-ray signature of PWN J1809–193 in light of the scenario that the PWN was struck by the reverse shock of the parent supernova remnant. Based on the evolutionary theory of PWNe, we consider that, when the PWN was disrupted during a collision by the reverse shock, some VHE electrons escaped impulsively. The remaining electrons stayed in the relic PWN, which was displaced from the pulsar. The VHE part of the remaining electrons was depleted by the strong magnetic field that was enhanced by the reverse shock compression in the reverberation stage, leaving the other part of them generating GeV emission. The particles injected from the pulsar after the disruption enter the relic PWN through the newly formed tunnel called the cocoon. The gamma-ray emission from the escaped electrons can account for the TeV spectrum of component A of HESS J1809–193 or the TeV halo, while the electrons remaining after disruption can account for the GeV spectrum of J1810.3–1925e. Thus, the combination of contributions from these two populations of electrons naturally reproduces the saddle-like SED of HESS 1809–193 and J1810.3–1925e from 5 GeV to 30 TeV, together with the spectral hardening around 100 GeV. We also show that the post-disruption injection of electrons can explain the spectrum of the relatively faint gamma-ray emission of component B of HESS J1809–193.

<title>First Detection of Radio Emission from the Intermediate-mass Black Hole in POX 52: Deep Multiband Observations with ATCA and VLA</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the first multiband centimeter detection of POX 52, a nearby dwarf galaxy believed to harbor a robust intermediate-mass black hole. We conducted the deep observations using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), spanning frequencies from 4.5 to 10 GHz, as well as the sensitive observations from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) operating in its most extended A configuration at S band (2–4 GHz) and C band (4–8 GHz). In the ATCA observations, the source shows a compact morphology, with only one direction marginally resolved. The higher resolution of the VLA allowed us to slightly resolve the source, fitting it well with a two-dimensional Gaussian model. The detected radio emission confirms the presence of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, indicating either a low-power jet or AGN-driven winds/outflows. Our dual-epoch observations with ATCA and VLA, together with previous nondetection flux density upper limits, reveal radio emission variability spanning two decades. In addition, we find that POX 52 aligns well with the low-mass extension of the fundamental plane for high-accretion, radio-quiet massive AGNs.

<title>Delay of Near-relativistic Electrons with Respect to Type III Radio Bursts throughout the Inner Heliosphere</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Energetic electrons accelerated by solar eruptive events are frequently observed to have inferred injection times that appear significantly delayed with respect to electromagnetic emission including type III radio bursts. This is noteworthy because type III radio emission is produced by streaming suprathermal electrons, and thus this observed delay implies either a delayed injection/release of higher-energy electrons, compared with the suprathermal population, and/or a delay of the electrons observed in situ in transit through the interplanetary medium. A number of studies have investigated these delays with spacecraft located at 1 au. In this study, we examine energetic electron onsets and type III radio bursts observed by the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (IS⊙IS) and the FIELDS Radio Frequency Spectrometer instrument on Parker Solar Probe at a variety of heliocentric distances. With these observations, we can uniquely decouple the effects of acceleration and transport and shed light on the source of these delays. We present a survey of electron events observed by IS⊙IS within the first ∼6 yr of the mission, including their delays with respect to type III emission between ∼0.1 and 0.8 au. These results suggest that energetic electron delays with respect to type III radio bursts are not purely produced by a delayed injection/release as has been suggested, implying that transport processes play a role.

<title>Constraints on Relativistic Jets from the Fast X-Ray Transient 210423 Using Prompt Radio Follow-up Observations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Fast X-ray transients (FXTs) are a new observational class of phenomena with no clear physical origin. This is at least partially a consequence of limited multiwavelength follow-up of this class of transients in real time. Here we present deep optical (g- and i-band) photometry with Keck, and prompt radio observations with the Very Large Array of FXT 210423 obtained at δt ≈ 14–36 days since the X-ray trigger. We use these multiband observations, combined with publicly available data sets, to constrain the presence and physical properties of on-axis and off-axis relativistic jets such as those that can be launched by neutron star mergers and tidal disruption events, which are among the proposed theoretical scenarios of FXTs. Considering a wide range of possible redshifts z ≤ 3.5, circumstellar medium density n = 10−6–10−1 cm−3, and isotropic-equivalent jet kinetic energy Ek,iso = 1048–1055 erg, we find that we can rule out wide jets with opening angle θj = 15° viewed within 10° off-axis. For more collimated jets (θj = 3°) we can only rule out on-axis (θobs = 0°) orientations. This study highlights the constraining power of prompt multiwavelength observations of FXTs discovered in real time by current (e.g., Einstein Probe) and future facilities.

“Changing-look active galactic nuclei” (CL AGN) show dramatic, rapid changes in optical/UV continuum and broad-line emission. The majority of CL AGN have been found dimming as “turn-off” CL AGN because most selection methods start from samples of spectroscopically confirmed quasars. We present here a sample of 82 spectroscopically confirmed “turn-on” CL AGN, 70 of which are newly identified. The turn-on CL AGN are selected from spectroscopically classified galaxies with subsequent significant and dramatic variability in both the optical and mid-infrared bands, indicating a mechanism of changing accretion rate of the supermassive black holes (BHs) rather than variable obscuration. Based on their bright state Eddington ratios, turn-on CL AGN are associated with lower accretion rates compared to turn-off CL AGN or typical Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasars with similar redshift and magnitude distributions, even though turn-on CL AGN have lower BH masses. Most turn-on CL AGN reside in host galaxies that follow local relations between the central BH mass and host galaxy properties, such as stellar mass and velocity dispersion. However, their host galaxies have higher mass than normal inactive galaxies, with star formation rates more similar to hosts of Type 2 AGN than to the overall galaxy population.

<title>Metallicity and α-abundance for 48 Million Stars in Low-extinction Regions in the Milky Way</title>

We estimate ([M/H], [α/M]) for 48 million giants and dwarfs in low-dust extinction regions from the Gaia DR3 XP spectra by using tree-based machine learning models trained on APOGEE DR17 and a metal-poor star sample from Li et al. The root mean square error of our estimation is 0.0890 dex for [M/H] and 0.0436 dex for [α/M], when we evaluate our models on the test data that are not used in training the models. Because the training data is dominated by giants, our estimation is most reliable for giants. The high-[α/M] stars and low-[α/M] stars selected by our ([M/H], [α/M]) show different kinematical properties for giants and low-temperature dwarfs. We further investigate how our machine learning models extract information on ([M/H], [α/M]). Intriguingly, we find that our models seem to extract information on [α/M] from Na D lines (589 nm) and Mg i line (516 nm). This result is understandable given the observed correlation between Na and Mg abundances in the literature. The catalog of ([M/H], [α/M]) as well as their associated uncertainties is publicly available.

<title>Statistics of the Interplanetary Magnetic Field from 0.1 to 30 au. I. Distribution Character</title>

This study investigates the directional and intensity distributions of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) across a heliocentric distance range of approximately 0.1–30 au. Measurements from multiple spacecraft reveal that these distributions align closely with the Parker spiral configuration in general. Nevertheless, the deviation from the model is significant and regular. To analyze these deviations, we organized the IMF observations based on the orientation and intensity predicted by the Parker model. The average angular deviation from the Parker spiral increases between 0.1 and 1 au, stabilizing from 1 to 30 au. The magnetic field components perpendicular to the Parker spiral are more likely to lay in the latitudinal and longitudinal directions during the solar maximum and minimum, respectively. The normalized intensity distribution follows a log-normal distribution, with its broadening positively correlated with increasing heliocentric distance. These characteristics cannot be fully attributed to Alfvénic fluctuations or the nonradial component near the potential field source surface. Instead, interactions of flux tubes in the outer heliosphere play a significant role in shaping the IMF. Our results provide a comprehensive assessment of the frequency with which planets encounter non-Parker upstream conditions.

<title>Assessing the Dark Matter Content of Two Quasar Host Galaxies at z ∼ 6 through Gas Kinematics</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada145</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada145</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We conduct a study of the gas kinematics of two quasar host galaxies at z ≳ 6 traced by the [C ii] emission line using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. By combining deep observations at both low and high resolution, we recover the diffuse emission, resolve its structure, and measure the rotation curves from the inner region of the galaxy to its outskirts using DysmalPy and 3DBarolo. Assuming that both galaxies exhibit disk rotation driven by the gravitational potential of the galaxy, we find that the best-fit disk models have a Vrot/σ ≈ 2 and inferred circular velocities out to ∼6–8 kpc scales, well beyond the likely stellar distribution. We then determine the mass profiles of each component (stars, gas, dark matter) with priors on the baryon and dark matter properties. We find relatively large dark matter fractions within their effective radii (fDM(R < Re) = and , respectively), which are significantly larger than those extrapolated from lower redshift studies and remain robust under different input parameters verified by Monte Carlo simulations. The large fDM(R < Re) corresponds to halo masses of ∼1012.5−1012.8M⊙, thus representative of the most massive halos at these redshifts. Notably, while the masses of these supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are approximately 1 dex higher than the low-redshift relationship with stellar mass, the closer alignment of SMBH and halo masses with a local relationship may indicate that the early formation of these SMBHs is linked to their dark matter halos, providing insights into the coevolution of galaxies and black holes in the early Universe.

<title>Magnetic Fields in Massive Star-forming Regions (MagMaR): The Magnetic Field at the Onset of High-mass Star Formation</title>

A complete understanding of the initial conditions of high-mass star formation and what processes determine multiplicity requires the study of the magnetic field in young massive cores. Using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 250 GHz polarization observations (0 3 = 1000 au) and ALMA 220 GHz high-angular-resolution observations (0 05 = 160 au), we have performed a full energy analysis including the magnetic field at core scales and have assessed what influences the multiplicity inside a massive core previously believed to be in the prestellar phase. With a mass of 31 M⊙, the G11.92 MM2 core has a young CS molecular outflow with a dynamical timescale of a few thousand years. At high resolution, the MM2 core fragments into a binary system, with a projected separation of 505 au and a binary mass ratio of 1.14. Using the Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi method with an angle dispersion function analysis, we estimate in this core a magnetic field strength of 6.2 mG and a mass-to-magnetic-flux ratio of 18. The MM2 core is strongly subvirialized, with a virial parameter of 0.064, including the magnetic field. The high mass-to-magnetic-flux ratio and low virial parameter indicate that this massive core is very likely undergoing runaway collapse, which is in direct contradiction with the core accretion model. The MM2 core is embedded in a filament that has a velocity gradient consistent with infall. In line with clump-fed scenarios, the core can grow in mass at a rate of 1.9–5.6 × 10−4M⊙ yr−1. In spite of the magnetic field having only a minor contribution to the total energy budget at core scales (a few thousands of astronomical units), it likely plays a more important role at smaller scales (a few hundreds of astronomical units) by setting the binary properties. Considering energy ratios and a fragmentation criterion at the core scale, the binary system could have been formed by core fragmentation. The binary system properties (projected separation and mass ratio), however, are also consistent with radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations with super-Alfvenic or supersonic (or sonic) turbulence that form binaries by disk fragmentation.

<title>Insights into the Properties of Type Ibn/Icn Supernovae and Their Progenitor Channels through X-Ray Emission</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9de6</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Type Ibn/Icn supernovae (SNe Ibn/Icn), which are characterized by narrow helium or carbon lines that originated in hydrogen-poor dense circumstellar medium (CSM), provide new insights into the final evolution of massive stars. While SNe Ibn/Icn are expected to emit strong X-rays through the strong supernova (SN)-CSM interaction, the X-ray emission modeling effort has been limited so far. In the present study, we provide broad-band X-ray light curve (LC) predictions for SNe Ibn/Icn. We find that the soft X-ray LC provides information about the CSM compositions, while the hard X-ray LC is a robust measure of the CSM density, the explosion energy, and the ejecta mass. In addition, considering the evolution of the ionization state in the unshocked CSM, a bright soft X-ray is expected in the first few days since the explosion, which encourages rapid X-ray follow-up observations as a tool to study the nature of SNe Ibn/Icn. Applying our model to the soft X-ray LCs of SNe Ibn 2006jc and 2022ablq, we derive that the CSM potentially contains a larger fraction of carbon and oxygen for SN 2006jc than 2022ablq, highlighting the power of the soft X-ray modeling to address the nature of the CSM. We also discuss detectability and observational strategy, with which the currently operating telescopes such as NuSTAR and Swift can offer an irreplaceable opportunity to explore the nature of these enigmatic rapid transients and their still-unclarified progenitor channel(s).

<title>Striking a Chord with Spectral Sirens: Multiple Features in the Compact Binary Population Correlate with H 0</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9de7</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9de7</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Spectral siren measurements of the Hubble constant (H0) rely on correlations between observed detector-frame masses and luminosity distances. Features in the source-frame mass distribution can induce these correlations. It is crucial, then, to understand (i) which features in the source-frame mass distribution are robust against model (re)parameterization, (ii) which features carry the most information about H0, and (iii) whether distinct features independently correlate with cosmological parameters. We study these questions using real gravitational-wave observations from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaborations' third observing run. Although constraints on H0 are weak, we find that current data reveals several prominent features in the mass distribution, including peaks in the binary black hole source-frame mass distribution near ∼9M⊙ and ∼32M⊙ and a roll-off at masses above ∼46M⊙. For the first time using real data, we show that all of these features carry cosmological information and that the peak near ∼32M⊙ consistently correlates with H0 most strongly. Introducing model-independent summary statistics, we show that these statistics independently correlate with H0, exactly what is required to limit systematics within future spectral siren measurements from the (expected) astrophysical evolution of the mass distribution.

<title>Chasing the Beginning of Reionization in the JWST Era</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent JWST observations at z > 6 may imply galactic ionizing photon production above prior expectations. Under observationally motivated assumptions about escape fractions, these suggest a z ~ 8–9 end to reionization, in tension with the z < 6 end required by the Lyα forest. In this work, we use radiative transfer simulations to understand what different observations tell us about when reionization ended and when it started. We consider a model that ends too early (zend ≈ 8) alongside two more realistic scenarios with zend ≈ 5: one starting late (z ~ 9) and another early (z ~ 13). We find that the latter requires up to an order-of-magnitude evolution in galaxy ionizing properties at 6 < z < 12, perhaps in tension with measurements of ξion by JWST, which indicate little evolution. We study how these models compare to recent measurements of the Lyα forest opacity, mean free path, intergalactic medium thermal history, visibility of z > 8 Lyα emitters, and the patchy kSZ signal from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We find that neither of the late-ending scenarios is strongly disfavored by any single data set. However, a majority of observables, spanning several distinct types of observations, prefer a late start. Not all probes agree with this conclusion, hinting at a possible lack of concordance arising from deficiencies in observations and/or theoretical modeling. Observations by multiple experiments (including JWST, Roman, and CMB-S4) in the coming years will establish a concordance picture of reionization's beginning or uncover such deficiencies.

<title>Late-time Optical and X-Ray Emission Evolution of the Oxygen-rich SN 1996cr</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada15b</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
When the ejecta of a supernova (SN) interact with the progenitor star's circumstellar environment, a strong shock is driven back into the ejecta, causing the material to become bright optically and in X-rays. Most notably, as the shock traverses the H-rich envelope, it begins to interact with metal-rich material. Thus, continued monitoring of bright and nearby SNe provides valuable clues about both the progenitor structure and its pre-SN evolution. Here we present late-time, multiepoch optical and Chandra X-ray spectra of the core-collapse SN, SN 1996cr. Magellan IMACS optical spectra taken in 2017 July and 2021 August show a very different spectrum from that seen in 2006 with broad, double-peaked optical emission lines of oxygen, argon, and sulfur with expansion velocities of ±4500 km s−1. Redshifted emission components are considerably fainter compared to the blueshifted components, presumably due to internal extinction from dust in the SN ejecta. Broad ±2400 km s−1 Hα is also seen, which we infer is shocked progenitor pre-SN, mass-loss, H-rich material. Chandra data indicate a slow but steady decline in the overall X-ray luminosity, suggesting that the forward shock has broken through any circumstellar shell or torus, which is inferred from prior deep Chandra ACIS-S/HETG observations. The X-ray properties are consistent with what is expected from a shock breaking out into a lower-density environment. Though originally identified as a Type IIn SN, based upon late-time optical emission-line spectra, we argue that the SN 1996cr progenitor was partially or highly stripped, suggesting a Type IIb/Ib SN.

<title>Fermi Unassociated Sources in the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Over 2000 γ-ray sources identified by the Large Area Telescope on NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope are considered unassociated, meaning that they have no known counterparts in any other frequency regime. We have carried out an image-based search for steep spectrum radio sources, with in-band spectral index < −1.4, within the error regions of Fermi unassociated sources using 1–1.4 GHz radio data from the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS) data release. The first MALS data release with a median rms noise of 22–25 μJy and 735,649 sources is a significant advance over past image-based searches with improvements in sensitivity, resolution, and bandwidth. Steep spectrum candidates were identified using a combination of in-band spectral indices from MALS and existing radio surveys. We developed an optical and infrared source classification scheme in order to distinguish between Galactic pulsars and radio galaxies. In total, we identify nine pulsar candidates toward six Fermi sources that are worthy of follow-up for pulsation searches. We also report 41 steep spectrum radio galaxy candidates that may be of interest in searches for high-redshift radio galaxies. We show that MALS, due to its excellent continuum sensitivity, can detect 80% of the known pulsar population. This exhibits the promise of identifying exotic pulsar candidates with future image-based surveys with the Square Kilometre Array and its precursors.

<title>Associations between Scattering Screens and Interstellar Medium Filaments</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Pulsar scintillation can be used to measure small-scale structure in the Galaxy, but little is known about the specific interstellar medium (ISM) features that cause scintillation. We searched for ISM counterparts to all scintillation screens for which absolute distances and scattering orientations have been measured—a sample of 12 pulsars and 22 screens. For one pulsar, PSR J0737–3039A, we reanalyze its scintillation screen and find evidence for a highly anisotropic screen. Comparisons with tracers of ionized media did not find any new associations. Instead, for seven of the pulsars analyzed, aligned H i filaments are seen for at least one of their screens, for a total of 12 out of 22 screens. This result seems unlikely to be due to chance: Comparing with random trials, we estimate a likelihood of finding 12 or more screens with aligned emission by chance of only 0.004%. Estimating the significance of the amount of aligned emission (in standard deviations over the mean), the probability of finding as much observed aligned emission by chance is larger, at 1.7%, but still indicative of a real correlation. Since H i filaments are preferentially associated with cold neutral gas, and thus unlikely to cause scintillation, this may indicate that both the filaments and the screens are aligned preferentially by the same mechanisms, such as magnetic fields or shocks.

<title>Neutrino-dominated Relativistic Viscous Accretion Flows around Rotating Black Holes with Shocks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the relativistic, viscous, advective neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs) around rotating stellar-mass black holes, incorporating neutrino cooling. By adopting an effective potential to describe the spacetime geometry around the rotating black holes, we self-consistently solve the governing NDAF equations to obtain global transonic accretion solutions. Our findings indicate that, depending on the model parameters, namely, energy (ε), angular momentum (λ), accretion rate ( ), viscosity (α), and black hole spin (ak), NDAFs may harbor standing shocks where the Rankine–Hugoniot shock conditions are satisfied. Utilizing these shock-induced NDAF solutions, we compute the neutrino luminosity (Lν) and neutrino annihilation luminosity ( ) across a wide range of model parameters. We further calculate maximum neutrino luminosity ( ) and neutrino annihilation luminosity ( ), resulting in erg s−1 (1048−51 erg s−1) and erg s−1 (1042−49 erg s−1) for ak = 0.99 (0.0). These findings suggest that shocked NDAF solutions are potentially promising to explain the energy output of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We employ our NDAF model formalism to elucidate for five GRBs with known redshifts and estimate their accretion rate ( ) based on the spin (ak) of the central source of the GRBs studied here.

<title>Deciphering Gas Dynamics and Star Formation in a z = 1.1 Main-sequence Spiral Galaxy with ALMA and JWST</title>

We present a joint analysis of high-resolution CO(2–1) and Paschen-α (Paα) emission lines to trace gas dynamics and spatially resolved star formation in ASPECS-LP.3 mm.06, a z = 1.1 main-sequence galaxy. Utilizing data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and JWST NIRCam wide field slitless spectroscopy, we explore both ionized gas and molecular gas within this galaxy. With a substantial molecular gas fraction (fmol = 0.44 ± 0.02), ASPECS-LP.3 mm.06 remains on the star-forming main sequence and adheres to the Kennicutt–Schmidt relation, indicating typical gas-to-star conversion efficiency. Our analysis reveals extended structures across multiple wavelengths, suggesting regulated star formation within a stable disk. The spatially resolved star formation efficiency and kinematic analysis indicate that ASPECS-LP.3mm.06 features a smooth mass assembly process across the bulge and disk. Additionally, the galaxy exhibits modest dust extinction (AV = 0.8), potentially linked to self-regulation during bulge formation. These findings position ASPECS-LP.3mm.06 as a prototypical galaxy, offering valuable insights into the mechanisms governing normal disk galaxy growth at z ∼ 1.

<title>GD-1 Stellar Stream and Cocoon in the DESI Early Data Release</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada690</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present ∼115 new spectroscopically identified members of the GD-1 tidal stream observed with the 5000-fiber Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We confirm the existence of a “cocoon,” which is a broad (FWHM ∼ 2 932 ∼ 460 pc) and kinematically hot (velocity dispersion, σ ∼ 5–8 km s−1) component that surrounds a narrower (FWHM ∼ 0 353 ∼ 55 pc) and colder [(σ = 3.09 ± 0.76 km s−1)] thin stream component (based on a median per star velocity precision of 2.7 km s−1). The cocoon extends over at least a 30∘ segment of the stream observed by DESI. The thin and cocoon components have similar mean values of [Fe/H]: −2.54 ± 0.04 dex and −2.47 ± 0.06 dex, suggestive of a common origin. The data are consistent with the following scenarios for the origin of the cocoon. The progenitor of the GD-1 stream was an accreted globular cluster (GC) and: (a) the cocoon was produced by pre-accretion tidal stripping of the GC while it was still inside its parent dwarf galaxy; (b) the cocoon comprises debris from the parent dwarf galaxy; (c) an initially thin GC tidal stream was heated by impacts from dark subhalos in the Milky Way; (d) an initially thin GC stream was heated by a massive Sagittarius dwarf galaxy; or a combination of some of these. Future DESI spectroscopy and detailed modeling may enable us to distinguish between these possible origins.

<title>Differentiating the Acceleration Mechanisms in the Slow and Alfvénic Slow Solar Wind</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In the corona, plasma is accelerated to hundreds of kilometers per second and heated to temperatures hundreds of times hotter than the Sun's surface before it escapes to form the solar wind. Decades of space-based experiments have shown that the energization process does not stop after it escapes. Instead, the solar wind continues to accelerate, and it cools far more slowly than a freely expanding adiabatic gas. Recent work suggests that fast solar wind requires additional momentum beyond what can be provided by the observed thermal pressure gradients alone, whereas it is sufficient for the slowest wind. The additional acceleration for fast wind can be provided through an Alfvén wave pressure gradient. Beyond this fast/slow categorization, however, a subset of slow solar wind exhibits high Alfvénicity that suggests that Alfvén waves could play a larger role in its acceleration compared to conventional slow wind outflows. Through a well-timed conjunction between Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe (PSP), we trace the energetics of slow wind to compare with a neighboring Alfvénic slow solar wind stream. An analysis that integrates remote and heliospheric properties and modeling of the two distinct solar wind streams finds that Alfvénic slow solar wind behaves like fast wind, where a wave pressure gradient is required to reconcile its full acceleration, while non-Alfvénic slow wind can be driven by its nonadiabatic electron and proton thermal pressure gradients. Derived coronal conditions of the source region indicate good model compatibility, but extended coronal observations are required to effectively trace solar wind energetics below PSP's orbit.

<title>Determination of the Analytical Solutions of the Radio Emission Geometry and Polar Cap Structure of Pulsars Having Perturbed Dipole</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We model an analytical solution to generate the shape of the polar cap structure and discuss the geometrical distortion due to the presence of both longitudinal plasma current flow across the polar cap regime, i.e., polar cap current perturbation, and pulsar rotation, i.e., rotational perturbation. An analytical solution to the parameter space associated with the radio emission geometrical coordinate is produced by using the first- and second-order power series expansion method for the rotationally perturbed dipole case. In general, polar caps show a quasi-elliptical shape, but in the presence of higher-order plasma current our results show that they can be converted into an elliptical structure with a monotonically reduced dimension. Our results show that the rotational effect also leads to a contraction of the dimensions of the polar cap for a given range of the obliquity parameters. We have found that the last open field line constant, as a fraction of the light cylinder radius, decreases in the presence of nonzero plasma current discharge. We also demonstrate that under certain conditions introducing a higher-order plasma current (e.g., with a scale factor ζp = J/JGJ close to 1 in the closed field line region) can lead to a structure resembling a cosmic-combed magnetosphere.

Understanding the nonlinear properties in accreting systems, particularly for black holes, from observation is illuminating as they are expected to be general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic flows that are nonlinear. Two commonly used features associated with nonlinear systems are chaos, which is deterministic, and randomness, which is stochastic. The differentiation between chaotic and stochastic systems is often considered to quantify the nonlinear properties of an astrophysical system. Particular emphasis is given to the fact that data are often noise contaminated and finite. We examine the dual nature of the black hole X-ray binary IGR J17091–3624, whose behavior has been closely studied in parallel to GRS 1915+105. Certain similarities in the temporal classes of these two objects have been explored in the literature. However, this has not been the case with their nonlinear dynamics: GRS 1915+105 shows signs of both determinism and stochasticity, while IGR J17091–3624 was found to be predominantly stochastic. Here, we confront the inherent challenge of noise contamination faced by previous studies, particularly Poisson noise, which adversely impacts the reliability of nonlinear results. We employ several denoising techniques to mitigate noise effects, and employ methods like principal component analysis, singular value decomposition, and correlation integrals to isolate the deterministic signatures. We find signs of determinism in IGR J17091–3624, thus supporting the hypothesis of it being similar to GRS 1915+105, even as a dynamical system. Our findings not only shed light on the complex nature of IGR J17091–3624 but also pave the way for future research employing noise-reduction techniques to analyze nonlinearity in observed dynamical systems.

<title>Tidal Reconstruction of Neutron Star Mergers from Their Late Inspiral</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the measurement correlation between the effective spin and the effective tidal deformability in gravitational-wave signals from binary neutron star mergers. To efficiently measure the effective tidal deformability parameter, we exploit the fact that the tidal effects in a binary system are prominent when the components are closer, during the late inspiral. Thus, we indicate a computationally efficient strategy of extracting the tidal information compressed within the seconds before the merger. We report our observations for GW170817 and explore the suitability of our approach for the upcoming observation scenarios of the current and future ground-based observatories. Fast and accurate measurements of the tidal deformability parameters can be used to inform astronomers when prioritizing the electromagnetic follow-up efforts for such sources.

<title>Spatial and Temporal Distribution of Nanoflare Heating during Active Region Evolution</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada3d6</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada3d6</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Nanoflares are believed to be key contributors to heating solar nonflaring active regions, though their individual detection remains challenging. This study uses a data-driven field-aligned hydrodynamic model to examine nanoflare properties throughout the lifecycle of active region (AR) 12758. We simulate coronal loop emissions, where each loop is heated by random nanoflares depending on the loop parameters derived from photospheric magnetograms observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager. Simulated X-ray flux and temperature can reproduce the temporal variations observed by the Chandrayaan-2/Solar X-ray Monitor. Our findings show that high-frequency nanoflares contribute to cool emissions across the AR, while low- and intermediate-frequency primarily contribute to hot emissions. During the emerging phase, energy deposition is dominated by low-frequency events. Post-emergence, energy is deposited by both low- and intermediate-frequency nanoflares, while as the AR ages, the contribution from intermediate- and high-frequency nanoflares increases. The spatial distribution of heating frequencies across the AR reveals a clear pattern: the core of the active region spends most of its time in a low-frequency heating state, the periphery is dominated by high-frequency heating, and the region between the core and periphery experiences intermediate-frequency heating.

The UltraViolet Imaging of the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey Fields (UVCANDELS) survey is a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Cycle-26 Treasury Program, allocated in total 164 orbits of primary Wide-Field Camera 3 Ultraviolet and VISible light F275W imaging with coordinated parallel Advanced Camera for Surveys F435W imaging, on four of the five premier extragalactic survey fields: GOODS-N, GOODS-S, EGS, and COSMOS. We introduce this survey by presenting a comprehensive analysis of the absolute escape fraction ( ) of Lyman continuum radiation through stacking the UV images of a population of star-forming galaxies with secure redshifts at 2.4 ≤ z ≤ 3.0. Our stacking benefits from the catalogs of high-quality spectroscopic redshifts compiled from archival ground-based data and HST slitless spectroscopy, carefully vetted by dedicated visual inspection efforts. We develop a robust stacking method to apply to 10 samples of in total 56 galaxies, and perform detailed Monte Carlo simulations of the intergalactic medium (IGM) attenuation, to take into account the sample variance of the mean IGM transmission when measuring . The full stack at z ≈ 2.44 from 28 galaxies places a stringent 1σ upper limit of , whereas the full stack at z ≈ 2.72 of an equal number of galaxies gives an upper limit of at 1σ confidence level.

<title>Unraveling the Kinematic and Morphological Evolution of the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada55f</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada55f</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We model the kinematics of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) by analyzing the proper motions (PMs) from Gaia DR3 of nine different stellar populations, including young main-sequence (MS) stars (<2 Gyr), red giant branch stars, red clump stars, red giants with line-of-sight velocities, and three groups of star clusters. This analysis is carried out using a robust Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, to derive up to seven kinematic parameters. We trace the evolution from a nonrotating flattened elliptical system, as mapped by the old population, to a rotating highly stretched disk structure, as denoted by the young MS stars and clusters (<400 Myr). We estimate that the inclination i (∼58°–82°) decreases and the position angle Θ (∼180°–240°) increases with age. We estimate an asymptotic velocity of ∼49–89 km s−1 with a scale radius of ∼6–9 kpc for the young MS populations, with velocity dispersion of ∼11 km s−1, suggesting a rotation-supported disk structure. Our models estimate a line-of-sight extension of ∼30 kpc, in agreement with observations. We identify four regions of the SMC showing anomalies in the residual PM: the East Anomaly, the Southeast Anomaly (SEA), the South Anomaly, and the West Anomaly. The SEA appears like an infalling feature and is identified for the first time. The tidal imprints observed in the residual PM of the SMC suggest that its evolution is considerably shaped by the recent interaction with the Large Magellanic Cloud.

<title>The Effects of Active Galactic Nuclei Feedback on the Lyα Forest Flux Power Spectrum</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada5f7</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada5f7</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the effects of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback on the Lyα forest 1D flux power spectrum (P1D). Using the Simba cosmological-hydrodynamic simulations, we examine the impact that adding different AGN feedback modes has on the predicted P1D. We find that, for Simba, the impact of AGN feedback is most dramatic at lower redshifts (z < 1) and that AGN jet feedback plays the most significant role in altering the P1D. The effects of AGN feedback can be seen across a large range of wavenumbers (1.5 × 10−3 < k < 10−1 s km−1) changing the ionization state of hydrogen in the IGM through heating. AGN feedback can also alter the thermal evolution of the IGM and thermally broaden individual Lyα absorbers. For the Simba model, these effects become observable at z ≲ 1.0. At higher redshifts (z > 2.0), AGN feedback has a 2% effect on the P1D for k < 5 × 10−2 s km−1 and an 8% effect for k > 5 × 10−2 s km−1. We show that the small-scale effect is reduced when normalizing the simulation to the observed mean flux. On large scales, the effect of AGN feedback appears via a change in the IGM temperature and is thus unlikely to bias cosmological parameters. The strong AGN jets in the Simba simulation can reproduce the z > 2 Lyα forest. We stress that analyses comparing different AGN feedback models to future higher precision data will be necessary to determine the full extent of this effect.

<title>MAGICS. II. Seed Black Holes Stripped of Their Surrounding Stars Do Not Sink</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada283</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Massive black hole (MBH) seed mergers are expected to be among the loudest sources of gravitational waves detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, providing a unique window into the birth and early growth of MBHs. We present the MAGICS-II simulation suite, which consists of six galaxy mergers that result in MBH seed mergers identified in the cosmological simulation ASTRID. With the enhanced resolution (mass resolution: 500 M⊙; softening length: 5 pc), improved subgrid models for the MBH dynamics and accretion, and the accurate regularized gravity integrator included in KETJU, we trace MBH seed dynamics down to 0.1 pc. After evolving all the systems for ≈1.2 Gyr in three stages (MAGICS-2000, MAGICS-500, and MAGICS-K), we find in four of the six systems that the MBHs stall at separations Δr ≳ 200 pc. Only in two systems, the MBHs manage to sink further, and only in one of them a bound binary forms. In the sinking systems, the MBH retains a population of bound stars. The final separation between the MBH is related to the surrounding unstripped stellar (and/or dark matter) mass: if more than 90% of the surrounding stellar system is stripped away, the MBHs stall. Besides the unstripped stars from the original host galaxy, we find that newly formed stars bound to the MBH significantly contribute to its sinking. Resolving the stellar system around MBH seeds, and its induced tidal interactions and dynamical friction is key for accurately capturing MBH dynamics. For this, high-resolution simulations are required. In a companion paper (MAGICS-III), we resimulate the central regions of these systems with an increased resolution to model directly the effects of actual star clusters around MBHs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Very Large Array (VLA) observations of 18 cm OH absorption lines were used to determine the strength of the line-of-sight magnetic field in the Galactic center region. This study is an extension of the VLA OH Zeeman observations of Killeen et al. with fourfold the on-source integration time and twice the sensitivity to the Zeeman effect. The new data fail to confirm the 7σ Zeeman detections of 2 mG fields reported in the earlier work. Also, we cannot reproduce these reported detections from our own analysis of archival data of the earlier work. We find no certain detections of the OH Zeeman effect in the Galactic center region. Our results suggest magnetic fields of no more than about a milligauss in the sampled regions.

It is commonly accepted that active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have a strong impact upon the evolution of their host galaxies, but the processes by which they do so are not fully understood. We aim to further the understanding of AGN feeding and feedback by examining an active galaxy using spatially resolved spectroscopy. We analyze integral field spectroscopy of the active galaxy NGC 5806, obtained using the Very Large Telescope Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer. We map the dynamics of gas and stars, as well as gas optical emission line fluxes throughout the central 8 × 8 kpc2 of the galaxy. We use emission line ratios to map gas metallicity and identify regions of gas excitation dominated by AGN/shocks or star formation. We also determine the average stellar population age and metallicity, and model the rotation and dynamics of the galaxy. We find that NGC 5806 has a star-forming circumnuclear ring, with a projected radius of ~400 pc. The dynamics of this galaxy are driven by a large-scale bar, which transports gas from the spiral arm to the central ring and potentially fuels the AGN. We also observe AGN-dominated gas excitation up to 3.3 kpc away from the center of the galaxy, showing the extended AGN effect on the gas in the central regions of the galaxy.

<title>TransformerPayne: Enhancing Spectral Emulation Accuracy and Data Efficiency by Capturing Long-range Correlations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b99</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Stellar spectra emulators often rely on large grids and tend to reach a plateau in emulation accuracy, leading to significant systematic errors when inferring stellar properties. Our study explores the use of Transformer models to capture long-range information in spectra, comparing their performance to the Payne emulator (a fully connected multilayer perceptron), an expanded version of The Payne, and a convolutional-based emulator. We tested these models on synthetic spectral grids, evaluating their performance by analyzing emulation residuals and assessing the quality of spectral parameter inference. The newly introduced TransformerPayne emulator outperformed all other tested models, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately 0.15% when trained on the full grid. The most significant improvements were observed in grids containing between 1000 and 10,000 spectra, with TransformerPayne showing 2–5 times better performance than the scaled-up version of The Payne. Additionally, TransformerPayne demonstrated superior fine-tuning capabilities, allowing for pretraining on one spectral model grid before transferring to another. This fine-tuning approach enabled up to a 10-fold reduction in training grid size compared to models trained from scratch. Analysis of TransformerPayne's attention maps revealed that they encode interpretable features common across many spectral lines of chosen elements. While scaling up The Payne to a larger network reduced its MAE from 1.2% to 0.3% when trained on the full data set, TransformerPayne consistently achieved the lowest MAE across all tests. The inductive biases of the TransformerPayne emulator enhance accuracy, data efficiency, and interpretability for spectral emulation compared to existing methods.

<title>Progenitor Diversity in the Accreted Stellar Halos of Milky Way–like Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Ongoing large stellar spectroscopic surveys of the Milky Way seek to reconstruct the major events in the assembly history of the Galaxy. Chemical and kinematic observations can be used to separate the contributions of different progenitor galaxies to the present-day stellar halo. Here, we compute the number of progenitors that contribute to the accreted stellar halos of simulated Milky Way–like galaxies as a function of radius (the radial diversity) in three suites of models: Bullock & Johnston, Aquarius, and Auriga. We show that there are significant differences between the predictions of these three models, beyond the halo-to-halo scatter expected in ΛCDM. Predictions of diversity from numerical simulations are sensitive to model-dependent assumptions regarding the efficiency of star formation in dwarf galaxies. We compare, at face value, to current constraints on the radial diversity of the Milky Way's accreted halo. These constraints imply that the halo of our Galaxy is dominated by ∼2 progenitors in the range 8–45 kpc, in contrast to averages of 7 progenitors in the Bullock & Johnston models, 3.5 in Aquarius, and 4.2 in Auriga over the same region. We additionally find that the models with radial diversity most similar to that of the Milky Way are predominantly those with ongoing merger events. The Milky Way therefore appears unusual in having an accreted stellar halo dominated by a small number of progenitors accreted at very early times.

<title>AEOS: Transport of Metals from Minihalos following Population III Stellar Feedback</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada3c1</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada3c1</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate how stellar feedback from the first stars (Population III) distributes metals through the interstellar and intergalactic medium using the star-by-star cosmological hydrodynamics simulation, Aeos. We find that energy injected from the supernovae (SNe) of the first stars is enough to expel a majority of gas and injected metals beyond the virial radius of halos with mass Mdm ≲ 107M⊙, regardless of the number of SNe. This prevents self-enrichment and results in a nonmonotonic increase in metallicity at early times. Most minihalos (Mdm ≳ 105M⊙) do not retain significant fractions of the yields produced within their virial radii until they have grown to halo masses of Mdm ≳ 107M⊙. The loss of metals to regions well beyond the virial radius delays the onset of enriched star formation and extends the period that Population III star formation can persist. We also explore the contributions of different nucleosynthetic channels to 10 individual elements. On the timescale of the simulation (lowest redshift z = 14.3), enrichment is dominated by core-collapse supernovae for all elements, but with a significant contribution from asymptotic giant branch winds to the s-process elements, which are normally thought to only be important at late times. In this work, we establish important mechanisms for early chemical enrichment, which allows us to apply Aeos in later epochs to trace the evolution of enrichment during the complete transition from Population III to Population II stars.

<title>Quantifying Baryonic Feedback on the Warm–Hot Circumgalactic Medium in CAMELS Simulations</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada442</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The baryonic physics shaping galaxy formation and evolution are complex, spanning a vast range of scales and making them challenging to model. Cosmological simulations rely on subgrid models that produce significantly different predictions. Understanding how models of stellar and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback affect baryon behavior across different halo masses and redshifts is essential. Using the SIMBA and IllustrisTNG suites from the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS) project, we explore the effect of parameters governing the subgrid implementation of stellar and AGN feedback. We find that while IllustrisTNG shows higher cumulative feedback energy across all halos, SIMBA demonstrates a greater spread of baryons, quantified by the closure radius and circumgalactic medium (CGM) gas fraction. This suggests that feedback in SIMBA couples more effectively to baryons and drives them more efficiently within the host halo. There is evidence that the different feedback modes are highly interrelated in these subgrid models. The parameters controlling the stellar feedback efficiency significantly impact AGN feedback, as seen in the suppression of black hole mass growth and delayed activation of AGN feedback to higher-mass halos with increasing stellar feedback efficiency in both simulations. Additionally, the AGN feedback efficiency parameters affect the CGM gas fraction at low halo masses in SIMBA, hinting at complex, nonlinear interactions between the AGN and supernova feedback modes. Overall, we demonstrate that stellar and AGN feedback are intimately interwoven, especially at low redshift, due to subgrid implementation, resulting in halo property effects that might initially seem counterintuitive.

<title>ALMA Observations of Solar Spicules in a Polar Coronal Hole</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada445</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report observations of solar spicules at millimeter wavelengths (mm-λ) using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). These are supplemented by observations in optical, ultraviolet (UV), and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths. The observations were made on 2018 December 25 of the northern polar coronal hole. ALMA obtained time-resolved imaging observations at wavelengths of 3 mm (100 GHz; 2 s cadence) and 1.25 mm (239 GHz; ≈2 minutes cadence) with an angular resolution of 2 2 × 1 3 and 1 5 × 0 7, respectively. Spicules observed at mm-λ are easily seen low in the chromosphere whereas spicules in UV bands are seen to extend higher. The spicules observed at mm-λ are seen in absorption against coronal EUV emission, allowing us to estimate the column depth of neutral hydrogen. Spicular emission at mm-λ, due to thermal free–free radiation, allows us to estimate the electron number density as a function of height. We find that spicule densities, inferred from the mm-λ data are uniquely insensitive to assumptions regarding the temperature of plasma in spicules. We suggest that the upward mass flux carried by spicules is unlikely to play a significant role in the mass budget of the solar corona and solar wind, and the transport of hot material into the corona by spicules may not play a significant role in coronal heating. However, the possibility that electric currents, fast kink and torsional waves, or other wave modes carried by spicules may play a role in transporting energy into the solar corona cannot be excluded.

<title>Black Hole Supernovae, Their Equation of State Dependence, and Ejecta Composition</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent literature on core-collapse supernovae suggests that a black hole (BH) can form within ∼1 s of shock revival, while still culminating in a successful supernova. We refer to these as BH supernovae, as they are distinct from other BH formation channels in both timescale and impact on the explosion. We simulate these events self-consistently from core collapse until 20–50 days after collapse using three axisymmetric models of a 60 M⊙ zero-age main-sequence progenitor star and investigate how the composition of the ejecta is impacted by the BH formation. We employ Skyrme-type equations of state (EOSs) and vary the uncertain nucleonic effective mass, which affects the pressure inside the proto–neutron star through the thermal part of the EOS. This results in different BH formation times and explosion energies at BH formation, yielding final explosion energies between 0.06 and 0.72 × 1051 erg with 21.8–23.3 M⊙ of ejecta, of which 0–0.018 M⊙ is 56Ni. Compared to expectations from 1D simulations, we find more nuanced EOS dependences of the explosion dynamics, the mass of the BH remnant, and the elemental composition of the ejecta. We investigate why the explosions survive despite the massive overburden and link the shape of the diagnostic energy curve and character of the ejecta evolution to the progenitor structure.

<title>Exploring Magnetic Fields in Molecular Clouds through Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Accurately measuring magnetic field strength in the interstellar medium, including giant molecular clouds, remains a significant challenge. We present a machine learning approach using denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) to estimate magnetic field strength from synthetic observables such as column density, orientation angles of the dust continuum polarization vector, and line-of-sight (LOS) nonthermal velocity dispersion. We trained three versions of the DDPM model: the 1-channel DDPM (using only column density), the 2-channel DDPM (incorporating both column density and polarization angles), and the 3-channel DDPM (which combines column density, polarization angles, and LOS nonthermal velocity dispersion). The code and trained model are available on GitHub at https://github.com/xuduo117/DDPM_Bmag. We assessed the models on both synthetic test samples and new simulation data that were outside the training set's distribution. The 3-channel DDPM consistently outperformed both the other DDPM variants and the power-law fitting approach based on column density alone, demonstrating its robustness in handling previously unseen data. Additionally, we compared the performance of the Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi (DCF) methods, both classical and modified, to the DDPM predictions. The classical DCF method overestimated the magnetic field strength by approximately an order of magnitude. Although the modified DCF method showed improvement over the classical version, it still fell short of the precision achieved by the 3-channel DDPM.

<title>Long-term Evolution of Sco X-1: Implications for the Current Spin Frequency and Ellipticity of the Neutron Star</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Sco X-1 is the brightest observed extrasolar X-ray source, which is a neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) and is thought to have a strong potential for continuous gravitational waves (CW) detection due to its high accretion rate and relative proximity. Here, we compute the long-term evolution of its parameters, particularly the NS spin frequency (ν) and the surface magnetic field (B), to probe its nature and its potential for CW detection. We find that Sco X-1 is an unusually young (∼7 × 106 yr) LMXB and constrain the current NS mass to ∼1.4–1.6 M⊙. Our computations reveal a rapid B decay, with the maximum current value of ∼1.8 × 108 G, which can be useful to constrain the decay models. Note that the maximum current ν value is ∼550 Hz, implying that, unlike what is generally believed, a CW emission is not required to explain the current source properties. However, ν will exceed an observed cutoff frequency of ∼730 Hz, and perhaps even the NS breakup frequency, in the future without a CW emission. The minimum NS mass quadrupole moment (Q) to avoid this is ∼(2–3) × 1037 g cm2, corresponding to a CW strain of ∼10−26. Our estimation of current ν values can improve the CW search sensitivity.

Holmberg 15A (H15A), the brightest cluster galaxy of A85, has an exceptionally low central surface brightness even among local massive elliptical galaxies with distinct stellar cores, making it exceedingly challenging to obtain high-quality spectroscopy to detect a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at its center. Aided by the superb sensitivity and efficiency of KCWI at the Keck II Telescope, we have obtained spatially resolved stellar kinematics over a ∼100″ × 100″ contiguous field of H15A for this purpose. The velocity field exhibits a low-amplitude (∼20 km s−1) rotation along a kinematic axis that is prominently misaligned from the photometric major axis, a strong indicator that H15A is triaxially shaped with unequal lengths for the three principal axes. Using 2500 observed kinematic constraints, we perform extensive calculations of stellar orbits with the triaxial Schwarzschild code, TriOS, and search over ∼40,000 galaxy models to simultaneously determine the mass and intrinsic 3D shape parameters of H15A. We determine a ratio of p = 0.89 for the middle-to-long principal axes and q = 0.65 for the short-to-long principal axes. Our best estimate of the SMBH mass, , makes H15A—along with NGC 4889—the galaxy hosting the most massive SMBHs known in the local Universe. Both SMBHs lie significantly above the mean MBH–σ scaling relation. Repeating the orbit modeling with the axisymmetrized version of TriOS produces worse fits to the KCWI kinematics and increases MBH to (2.55 ± 0.20) × 1010M⊙, which is still significantly below the MBH = (4.0 ± 0.8) × 1010M⊙ reported in a prior axisymmetric study of H15A.

<title>Multi-observatory Study of Young Stellar Energetic Flares (MORYSEF): No Evidence for Abnormally Strong Stellar Magnetic Fields after Powerful X-Ray Flares</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada55c</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We explore the empirical power-law relationship between X-ray luminosity (LX) and total surface magnetic flux (Φ), established across solar magnetic elements, time- and disk-averaged emission from the Sun, older active stars, and pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars. Previous models of large PMS X-ray flares, lacking direct magnetic field measurements, showed discrepancies from this baseline law, which MHD simulations attribute to unusually strong magnetic fields during flares. To test this, we used nearly simultaneous Chandra X-ray and HET-HPF near-infrared observations of four young Orion stars, measuring surface magnetic fields during or just after powerful PMS X-ray flares. We also modeled these PMS X-ray flares, incorporating their measured magnetic field strengths. Our findings reveal magnetic field strengths at the stellar surface typical of nonflaring PMS stars, ruling out the need for abnormally strong fields during flares. Both PMS and solar flares deviate from the LX–Φ law, with PMS flares exhibiting a more pronounced deviation, primarily due to their much larger active regions on the surface and larger flaring loop volumes above the surface compared to their solar counterparts. These deviations likely stem from the fact that powerful flares are driven by magnetic reconnection, while baseline X-ray emission may involve less efficient mechanisms like Alfvén wave heating. Our results also indicate a preference for dipolar magnetic loops in PMS flares, consistent with Zeeman–Doppler imaging of fully convective stars. This requirement for giant dipolar loops aligns with MHD predictions of strong dipoles supported by polar magnetic surface active regions in fast-rotating, fully convective stars.

<title>Sporadic Dips from Extended Debris Transiting the Metal-rich White Dwarf SBSS 1232+563</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the discovery of deep but sporadic transits in the flux of SBSS 1232+563, a metal-rich white dwarf polluted by disrupted exoplanetary debris. Nearly 25 yr of photometry from multiple sky surveys reveal evidence of occasional dimming of the white dwarf, most notably evident in an 8 month long event in 2023 that caused a >40% drop in flux from the star. In-transit follow-up shows additional short-timescale (minutes- to hours-long) dimming events. Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite photometry suggests a coherent 14.842 hr signal that could represent the dominant orbital period of debris. Six low-resolution spectra collected at various transit depths over two decades show no evidence of significant changes in the observed elemental abundances. SBSS 1232+563 demonstrates that debris transits around white dwarfs can be sporadic, with many years of inactivity before large-amplitude dimming events.

<title>Relativistic Binary Precession: Impact on Eccentric Massive Binary Black Hole Accretion and Hydrodynamics</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada612</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent hydrodynamical simulations have shown that circumbinary gas disks drive the orbits of massive binary black holes (BHs) to become eccentric, even when general relativistic (GR) corrections to the orbit are significant. Here, we study the GR apsidal precession of eccentric equal-mass massive binary BHs in circumbinary disks via two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. We perform a suite of simulations comparing precessing and nonprecessing binaries across a range of eccentricities, semimajor axes, and precession rates. We find that the GR precession of the binary's semimajor axis can introduce a dominant modulation in the binary's accretion rate and the corresponding high-energy electromagnetic light curves. We discuss the conditions under which this occurs and its detailed characteristics and mechanism. Finally, we discuss the potential to observe these precession signatures in electromagnetic- and gravitational-wave observations, as well as the precession signal's unique importance as a potential tool to constrain the mass, eccentricity, and semimajor axis of binary merger events.

<title>Influence of Effective Nucleon Mass on Equation of State for Supernova Simulations and Neutron Stars</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada6b3</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada6b3</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the influence of the effective nucleon mass on the equation of state (EOS), which is constructed for simulations of core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers, within the relativistic mean-field (RMF) framework. The study introduces a new RMF parameter set, TM1m, which is a modification of the TM1e model with an adjusted effective mass, maintaining the saturation properties of nuclear matter. The TM1m model, with a larger effective mass ratio (M*/M ~ 0.8) compared to the TM1e model (M*/M ~ 0.63), is employed to construct a new EOS table, EOS5. This EOS table is designed to offer insights into the influence of the effective nucleon mass on the EOS within a relativistic framework, particularly above the saturation density. The results of EOS5 are compared with those obtained from other models, including both relativistic and nonrelativistic approaches. The properties of cold neutron stars, calculated using the TM1m model, are compatible with the existence of a 2 M⊙ pulsar and the latest constraints on the tidal deformability and radii of a canonical 1.4 M⊙ neutron star, derived from astrophysical observations.

<title>Observations of Microlensed Images with Dual-field Interferometry: On-sky Demonstration and Prospects</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b14</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Interferometric observations of gravitational microlensing events offer an opportunity for precise, efficient, and direct mass and distance measurements of lensing objects, especially those of isolated neutron stars and black holes. However, such observations have previously been possible for only a handful of extremely bright events. The recent development of a dual-field interferometer, GRAVITY Wide, has made it possible to reach out to significantly fainter objects and increase the pool of microlensing events amenable to interferometric observations by 2 orders of magnitude. Here, we present the first successful observation of a microlensing event with GRAVITY Wide and the resolution of microlensed images in the event OGLE-2023-BLG-0061/KMT-2023-BLG-0496. We measure the angular Einstein radius of the lens with subpercent precision, θE = 1.280 ± 0.009 mas. Combined with the microlensing parallax detected from the event light curve, the mass and distance to the lens are found to be 0.472 ± 0.012 M⊙ and 1.81 ± 0.05 kpc, respectively. We present the procedure for the selection of targets for interferometric observations and discuss possible systematic effects affecting GRAVITY Wide data. This detection demonstrates the capabilities of the new instrument, and it opens up completely new possibilities for the follow-up of microlensing events and future routine discoveries of isolated neutron stars and black holes.

<title>Do Unusually Cold Starburst Galaxies Exist? A Case Study</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada4ac</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada4ac</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report observations of CO(J = 9 → 8) and OH+(N = 1 → 0) toward the four millimeter-selected lensed starburst galaxies SPT 2354−58, 0150−59, 0314−44, and 0452−50, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Atacama Compact Array, as part of a larger study of OH+ in the early Universe. In this work, we use these observations for the main purpose of spectroscopic redshift measurements. For all sources except SPT 0452−50, we confirm the previously reported most likely redshifts, and we find typical CO and OH+ properties for massive starbursts. For SPT 0452−50, we rule out the previously reported value of z = 2.0105, measuring a firm redshift of z = 5.0160 based on [O i], [C ii], H2O, and CO emission instead when adding in ancillary ALMA data. Previously, SPT 0452−50 was considered an outlier in relations between dust temperature, far-infrared luminosity, and redshift, which may have hinted at an unusually cold starburst with a dust temperature of only Tdust = (21 ± 2) K. Instead, our new measurements suggest it to be among highly luminous massive dusty starbursts at z > 5, with rather typical properties within that population. We find a revised dust temperature of Tdust = (76.2 ± 2.5) K, and an updated lensing-corrected far-infrared luminosity (42.5–122.5 μm) of (2.35 ) × 1013L⊙, i.e., about an order of magnitude higher than previously reported. We thus do not find evidence for the existence of unusually cold starburst galaxies in the early Universe that were missed by previous selection techniques.

<title>ALMA Observations of Massive Clouds in the Central Molecular Zone: External-pressure-confined Dense Cores and Salpeter-like Core Mass Functions</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9f28</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9f28</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 6 (1.3 mm) observations of dense cores in three massive molecular clouds within the central molecular zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way, including the Dust Ridge cloud e, Sgr C, and the 20 km s−1 cloud, at a spatial resolution of 2000 au. Among the 834 cores identified from the 1.3 mm continuum, we constrain temperatures and linewidths of 253 cores using local thermodynamic equilibrium methods to fit the H2CO and/or CH3CN spectra. We determine their masses using the 1.3 mm dust continuum and derived temperatures, and then evaluate their virial parameters using the H2CO and/or CH3CN linewidths and construct the core mass functions (CMFs). We find that the contribution of external pressure is crucial for the virial equilibrium of the dense cores in the three clouds, which contrasts with the environment in the Galactic disk where dense cores are already bound, even without the contribution of external pressure. With our new temperature estimates we also find that the CMFs show a Salpeter-like slope in the high-mass (≳3–6 M⊙) end, a change from previous works. Combined with the possible top-heavy initial mass functions (IMFs) in the CMZ, our result suggests that gas accretion and further fragmentation may play important roles in transforming the CMF to the IMF.

<title>Signatures of Core-envelope Rotational Misalignment in the Mixed-mode Asteroseismology of Kepler-56</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada4a3</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada4a3</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Existing asteroseismic rotational measurements assume that stars rotate around a single axis. However, tidal torques from misaligned companions, or their possible engulfment, may bring the rotational axis of a star's envelope out of alignment with its core, breaking azimuthal symmetry. I derive perturbative expressions for asteroseismic signatures of such hitherto unexamined rotational configurations, under the “shellular approximation” of constant rotation rates on radially stratified mass shells. In the aligned case, the distribution of power between multiplet components is determined by the inclination of the rotational axis; radial differential misalignment causes this to vary from multiplet to multiplet. I examine in particular detail the phenomenology of gravitoacoustic mixed modes as seen in evolved sub- and red giants, where near-resonance avoided crossings may break geometrical degeneracies. Upon applying the revised asteroseismic observational methodology that results from this theoretical discussion to revisit Kepler-56—a red giant with a misaligned planetary system—I find that its core and envelope rotate around different rotational axes. While the rotational axis of its core is indeed misaligned from the orbit normal of its transiting planets (consistently with earlier studies), its envelope's rotational axis is close to lying in the sky plane, and may well be aligned with them. More detailed asteroseismic modeling, and spectroscopic follow-up, will be required to fully elucidate the full spin–orbit geometry of the Kepler-56 system, and potentially discriminate between hypotheses for how it formed.

<title>Dust Scattering Albedo at Millimeter Wavelengths in the TW Hya Disk</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9f31</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9f31</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Planetary bodies are formed by coagulation of solid dust grains in protoplanetary disks. Therefore, it is crucial to constrain the physical and chemical properties of the dust grains. In this study, we measure the dust albedo at millimeter wavelength, which depends on dust properties at the disk midplane. Since the albedo and dust temperature are generally degenerate in observed thermal dust emission, it is challenging to determine them simultaneously. We propose to break this degeneracy by using multiple optically thin molecular lines as a dust–albedo-independent thermometer. In practice, we employ pressure-broadened CO line wings that provide an exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratio as an optically thin line. We model the CO J = 2–1 and 3–2 spectra observed by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at the inner region (r < 6 au) of the TW Hya disk and successfully derive the midplane temperature. Combining multiband continuum observations, we constrain the albedo spectrum at 0.9–3 mm for the first time without assuming a dust opacity model. The albedo at these wavelengths is high, ~0.5–0.8, and broadly consistent with the L. Ricci et al., DIANA, and DSHARP dust models. Even without assuming dust composition, we estimate the maximum grain size to be ~340 μm, the power-law index of the grain size distribution to be >−4.1, and the porosity to be <0.96. The derived dust size may suggest efficient fragmentation with a threshold velocity of ~0.08 m s−1. We also note that the absolute flux uncertainty of ~10% (1σ) is measured and used in the analysis, which is approximately twice the usually assumed value.

<title>Little Red Dots: Rapidly Growing Black Holes Reddened by Extended Dusty Flows</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada5fb</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada5fb</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have revolutionized extragalactic research, particularly with the discovery of little red dots (LRDs), which have been discovered as a population of dust-reddened broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Their unique V-shaped spectral feature, characterized by a red optical continuum and a UV excess in the rest frame, challenges us to discern the relative contributions of the galaxy and AGN. We study a spectral energy distribution (SED) model for LRDs from rest-frame UV to infrared bands. We hypothesize that the incident radiation from an AGN, characterized by a typical SED, is embedded in an extended dusty medium with an extinction law similar to those seen in dense regions such as Orion Nebula or certain AGN environments. The UV−optical spectrum is described by dust-attenuated AGN emission, featuring a red optical continuum at λ > 4000 Å and a flat UV spectral shape established through a gray extinction curve at λ < 3000 Å, due to the absence of small-size grains. There is no need for additional stellar emission or AGN scattered light. In the infrared, the SED is shaped by an extended dust and gas distribution (γ < 1; ρ ∝ r−γ) with characteristic gas densities of ≃10–103 cm−3, which allows relatively cool dust temperatures to dominate the radiation. As a result, these dust structures shift the emission energy peak from near-infrared to mid-infrared bands in the rest frame; for sources at z ~ 4–7, the corresponding wavelengths shift from the JWST/MIRI to Herschel range. This model, unlike the typical AGN hot torus models, can produce an infrared SED flattening that is consistent with LRD observations through JWST MIRI. Such a density structure can arise from the coexistence of inflows and outflows during the early assembly of galactic nuclei. This might be the reason why LRDs emerge preferentially in the high-redshift Universe younger than 1 billion years.

<title>Detectability of Emission from Exoplanet Outflows Calculated by pyTPCI, a New 1D Radiation-hydrodynamic Code</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Photoevaporation in exoplanet atmospheres is thought to contribute to the shaping of the small planet radius valley. Escaping atmospheres have been detected in transmission across a variety of exoplanet types, from hot Jupiters to mini-Neptunes. However, no work has yet considered whether outflows might also be detectable in emission. We introduce pyTPCI, a new, open-source self-consistent 1D radiative-hydrodynamics code that is an improved version of The PLUTO-CLOUDY Interface. We use pyTPCI to model seven exoplanets (HD 189733b, HD 209458b, WASP-69b, WASP-107b, TOI-1430b, TOI-560b, and HAT-P-32b) at varying metallicities and compute their emission spectra to investigate their detectability across a variety of spectral lines. We calculate the eclipse depths and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of these lines for a 10 m class telescope with a high-resolution spectrograph, taking into account appropriate line broadening mechanisms. We show that the most detectable spectral lines tend to be the 589 nm Na i doublet and the 1083 nm metastable helium triplet. Hα and Mg i 457 nm are moderately strong for some planets at some metallicities, but they are almost always optically thin, so some of their emission may not be from the outflow. The planet with the highest-flux, highest-eclipse-depth, and highest-SNR lines is HD 189733b, with a Na i eclipse depth of 410 ppm and SNR of 2.4 per eclipse, and a He* eclipse depth of 170 ppm and SNR of 1.3. These signals would be marginally detectable with Keck if 3–10 eclipses were observed, assuming (over optimistically) photon limited observations.

<title>Strong-lensing Analysis of SPT-CL J2325−4111 and SPT-CL J0049−2440, Two Powerful Cosmic Telescopes (R E > 40″) from the SPT Clusters Sample</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9aa5</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the results from a study of two massive (M500c > 6.0 × 1014 M⊙) strong-lensing clusters selected from the South Pole Telescope cluster survey for their large Einstein radius (RE > 40″), SPT-CL J2325−4111 and SPT-CL J0049−2440. Ground-based and shallow Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging indicated extensive strong-lensing evidence in these fields, with giant arcs spanning 18″ and 31″, respectively, motivating further space-based imaging follow-up. Here, we present multiband HST imaging and ground-based Magellan spectroscopy of the fields, from which we compile detailed strong-lensing models. The lens models of SPT-CL J2325−4111 and SPT-CL J0049−2440 were optimized using nine and eight secure multiply imaged systems with a final image-plane rms of 0 63 and 0 73, respectively. From the lensing analysis, we measure a projected mass density within 500 kpc of M(<500 kpc) = (7.30 ± 0.07) × 1014M⊙ and M⊙ for these two clusters, and subhalo mass ratios of 0.12 ± 0.01 and , respectively. Both clusters produce a large area with high magnification (μ ≥ 3) for a source at z = 9, arcmin2 and arcmin2, respectively, placing them in the top tier of strong-lensing clusters. We conclude that these clusters are spectacular sightlines for further observations that will reduce the systematic uncertainties due to cosmic variance. This paper provides the community with two additional well-calibrated cosmic telescopes, as strong as the Frontier Fields and suitable for studies of the highly magnified background Universe.

<title>A Search for Radio Millisecond Pulsar Companions around Extremely Low-mass White Dwarfs with Ellipsoidal Variability</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Extremely low-mass (ELM) white dwarfs (WDs) are helium-core WDs with masses less than 0.3 M⊙. Short-period ELM WD binaries that exhibit ellipsoidal variations may harbor heavier companions, either massive WDs or millisecond pulsars (MSPs). In this study, we selected ∼12,000 ELM WDs or their candidates, and searched for ellipsoidal-like lightcurves with orbital periods shorter than 1 day, by using the public data from Zwicky Transient Facility. Finally, 23 such systems were found, with 17 being newly discovered. We selected nine high-priority targets likely to evolve from the Roche lobe overflow channel and estimated their companion masses from the extracted ellipsoidal variation amplitude. Among them, four targets have companion masses exceeding 1 M⊙. We performed a search for radio pulsations from six of these targets by using Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope. However, no convincing radio pulse signals were found, resulting in upper limits for the radio flux at around 8 μJy. Given the nondetection of radio pulsations from a total of 11 similar systems, the fraction of ellipsoidal ELM WDs around MSPs is estimated to be below 15 %. We anticipate that multiwavelength studies of more ellipsoidal-like ELM WDs will further constrain the fraction.

<title>Analysis of the Internal Radial Gradient of Chemical Abundances in Spiral Galaxies from CALIFA</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The study of chemical evolution is of paramount importance for understanding the evolution of galaxies. Models and observations propose an inside-out mechanism in the formation of spiral galaxy disks, implying a negative radial gradient of elemental abundances when represented on a logarithmic scale. However, in some instances, the observed chemical abundance gradients deviate from a single negative straight line, revealing inner drops or outer flattenings, particularly in more massive galaxies. This study analyzes oxygen abundance gradients in spiral galaxies based on observations from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area survey. Our focus is specifically on examining oxygen abundance gradient profiles, as obtained with data from H ii regions, with a special emphasis on the inner radial gradient. We employ an automated fitting procedure to establish correlations between the physical properties of galaxies and bulges and the presence of these inner drops, seeking potential explanations for these variations in gradient. We find that the different criteria used in the literature to distinguish H ii regions from other ionization sources in the galaxies, such as active galactic nuclei, significantly impact the results, potentially altering abundance gradient profiles and uncovering galaxies with distinct inner drops. Additionally, we analyze the abundance radial gradients to investigate the impact of diffuse ionized gas (DIG) decontamination on oxygen abundances over these inner drops. We observe that DIG, concentrated mainly in the central regions of galaxies, can modify oxygen abundance gradient profiles if left unaddressed.

<title>JWST Imaging of Edge-on Protoplanetary Disks. IV. Mid-infrared Dust Scattering in the HH 30 Disk</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9c6f</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9c6f</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present near- and mid-infrared (IR) broadband imaging observations of the edge-on protoplanetary disk around HH 30 with the James Webb Space Telescope/Near Infrared Camera and the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). We combine these observations with archival optical/near-IR scattered light images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope and a millimeter-wavelength dust continuum image obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) with the highest spatial resolution ever obtained for this target. Our multiwavelength images clearly reveal the vertical and radial segregation of micron-sized and submillimeter-sized grains in the disk. In the near- and mid-IR, the images capture not only bireflection nebulae separated by a dark lane but also diverse dynamical processes occurring in the HH 30 disk, such as spiral- and tail-like structures, a conical outflow, and a collimated jet. In contrast, the ALMA image reveals a flat dust disk in the disk midplane. By performing radiative transfer simulations, we show that grains of about 3 μm in radius or larger are fully vertically mixed to explain the observed mid-IR scattered light flux and its morphology, whereas millimeter-sized grains are settled into a layer with a scale height of ≳1 au at 100 au from the central star. We also find a tension in the disk inclination angle inferred from optical/near-IR and millimeter observations, with the latter being closer to exactly edge-on. Finally, we report the first detection of the proper motion of an emission knot associated with the mid-IR collimated jet detected by combining two epochs of our MIRI 12.8 μm observations.

<title>Revisiting Near-infrared Features of Kilonovae: The Importance of Gadolinium</title>

The observation of the kilonova AT2017gfo and investigations of its light curves and spectra confirmed that neutron star mergers are sites of r-process nucleosynthesis. However, the identification of elements responsible for the spectral features is still challenging, particularly at the near-infrared wavelengths. In this study, we systematically searched for all possible near-infrared transitions of heavy elements using experimentally calibrated energy levels. Our analysis reveals that most candidate elements with strong absorption lines are lanthanides (Z = 57–71) and actinides (Z = 89–103). This is due to their complex structures leading to many low-lying energy levels, which results in strong transitions in the near-infrared range. N. Domoto et al. (2022) have shown that La iii and Ce iii can explain the absorption features at λ ∼ 12000–15000 Å. While our results confirm that these two elements show strong infrared features, we additionally identify Gd iii as the next most promising species. Due to its unique atomic structure involving the half-filled 4f and the outer 5d orbitals, Gd iii has one of the lowest-lying energy levels, between which relatively strong transitions occur. We also find absorption lines caused by Gd iii in the near-infrared spectrum of a chemically peculiar star HR 465, which supports their emergence in kilonova spectra. By performing radiative transfer simulations, we confirm that Gd iii lines affect the feature at ∼12000 Å previously attributed to La iii. Future space-based time-series observations of kilonova spectra will allow the identification of Gd iii lines.

<title>The Magnetic Origin of the Mystery of Rare Hα Moreton Waves</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada387</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Over the past three decades, a lot of coronal fast-mode waves have been detected by space missions, but their counterparts in the chromosphere, called Moreton waves, have rarely been captured. How this happens remains a mystery. Here, to shed light on this problem, we investigate the photospheric vector magnetograms of the Moreton-wave events associated with M- and X-class solar flares during 2010–2023. The Hα data are taken with the Global Oscillation Network Group and the Chinese Hα Solar Explorer. Our statistical results show that more than 80% of the events occur at the edges of active regions and propagate nonradially, due to asymmetric magnetic fields above the flares. According to the reconstructed magnetic field and atmospheric model, Moreton waves propagate in the direction along which the horizontal fast-mode wave speed drops the fastest. This result supports the inclined magnetic configuration of the eruption being crucial for generating Moreton waves, even for X-class flares. It may explain the low occurrence rate of Moreton waves and why some X-class flares accompanied with coronal mass ejections do not generate Moreton waves.

<title>Asymmetries and Circumstellar Interaction in the Type II SN 2024bch</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a comprehensive multi-epoch photometric and spectroscopic study of SN 2024bch, a nearby (19.9 Mpc) Type II supernova (SN) with prominent early high-ionization emission lines. Optical spectra from 2.8 days after the estimated explosion reveal narrow lines of H i, He ii, C iv, and N iv that disappear by day 6. High-cadence photometry from the ground and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite show that the SN brightened quickly and reached a peak MV ~ −17.8 mag within a week of explosion, and late-time photometry suggests a 56Ni mass of 0.050 M⊙. High-resolution spectra from days 7.9 and 43 trace the unshocked circumstellar medium (CSM) and indicate a wind velocity of 30–40 km s−1, a value consistent with a red supergiant (RSG) progenitor. Comparisons between models and the early spectra suggest a pre-SN mass-loss rate of , which is too high to be explained by quiescent mass loss from RSGs, but is consistent with some recent measurements of similar SNe. Persistent blueshifted H i and [O i] emission lines seen in the optical and near-IR spectra could be produced by asymmetries in the SN ejecta, while the multicomponent Hα may indicate continued interaction with an asymmetric CSM well into the nebular phase. SN 2024bch provides another clue to the complex environments and mass-loss histories around massive stars.

<title>First Results from the JWST Early Release Science Program Q3D: The Fast Outflow in a Red Quasar at z = 0.44</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Quasar feedback may play a key role in the evolution of massive galaxies. The dust-reddened quasar F2M110648.35+480712 at z = 0.4352 is one of the few cases at its redshift that exhibits powerful quasar feedback through bipolar outflows. Our new observation with the integral field unit mode of the Near-infrared Spectrograph on board JWST opens a new window to examine this spectacular outflow through the Paα emission line with ~3× better spatial resolution than previous work. The morphology and kinematics of the Paα nebula confirm the existence of a bipolar outflow extending on a scale of ∼17 × 14 kpc and with a velocity reaching ∼1100 km s−1. The higher spatial resolution of our new observation leads to more reliable measurements of outflow kinematics. Considering only the spatially resolved outflow and assuming an electron density of 100 cm−2, the mass, momentum, and kinetic energy outflow rates are ∼50–210 M⊙ yr−1, ∼(0.3–1.7) × 1036 dynes (∼14%–78% of the quasar photon momentum flux), and ∼(0.16–1.27) × 1044 erg s−1 (∼0.02%–0.20% of the quasar bolometric luminosity), respectively. The local instantaneous outflow rates generally decrease radially. We infer that the quasar is powerful enough to drive the outflow, while stellar processes cannot be overlooked as a contributing energy source. The mass outflow rate is ∼0.4–1.5 times the star formation rate, and the ratio of kinetic energy outflow rate to the quasar bolometric luminosity is comparable to the minimum value required for negative quasar feedback in simulations. This outflow may help regulate the star formation activity within the system to some extent.

<title>3D Nonequilibrium Ionization and Spectroscopic Modeling of Coronal Mass Ejections. I. Comparison with Hinode/EIS Observations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
High-resolution EUV spectroscopy provides an informative diagnostic tool for the early evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) since it can directly measure many physical properties of CME plasma close to the Sun that cannot be determined from white-light coronagraphs or narrowband imagers. The Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) captured a series of high-resolution EUV spectra of the 2008 April 9 event, also known as the “Cartwheel CME,” during its initial acceleration period. CMEs are inherently dynamic events, driving the plasma from ionization equilibrium, which makes the nonequilibrium ionization (NEI) effects important when analyzing spectral observations. In this work, we performed simulations of the Cartwheel CME using the Alfvén Wave Solar atmosphere Model (AWSoM) to provide insight into the plasma structure and dynamics during the early evolution of this CME. For the first time, we combined self-consistent nonequilibrium charge state calculations in the EUV spectral line synthesis for a CME simulation to account for the plasma departures from ionization equilibrium everywhere in the CME. In this first paper of the series, we compare the simulation results to the EIS observations of this event to assess the quality of the AWSoM predictions. We find that the CME is out of equilibrium, indicating that NEI effects should be considered in the EUV spectral synthesis. Overall, the model reproduces the thermodynamic evolution of the CME in the low solar corona well, as compared to the EIS observations.

<title>Hybrid Simulations of Interstellar Pickup Ions at the Solar Wind Termination Shock Revisited</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada89c</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada89c</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We revisit previous hybrid simulations of the heating and acceleration of interstellar pickup ions (PUIs) at the solar wind termination shock. In previous simulations, a relatively cold initial distribution of PUIs was assumed; and while the resulting shock-heated distribution was consistent with Voyager 2 LECP measurements at about 30 keV, the intensity of the distribution downstream of the shock in the ~1–10 keV energy range was lower than predictions based on analysis of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) from the Interstellar Boundary Explorer-Hi and Cassini's Ion and Neutral Camera. Here we perform new simulations with more realistic initial PUI distributions. We assume the distribution is a partially filled spherical shell in velocity space with a radius that varies from 320 to 640 km s−1. We then use the distributions downstream of the shock from these new simulations to estimate the ENA flux spectrum and compare with observations. We find that the predicted ENA spectrum from the new simulations much better matches the observations over a broad range of energies. We conclude that the hybrid simulations provide reasonable predictions for the distribution of charged particles in the energy range from ~0.5 to 50 keV.

<title>AEOS: Star-by-star Cosmological Simulations of Early Chemical Enrichment and Galaxy Formation</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada4a1</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada4a1</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Aeos project introduces a series of high-resolution cosmological simulations that model star-by-star chemical enrichment and galaxy formation in the early Universe, achieving 1 pc resolution. These simulations capture the complexities of galaxy evolution within the first ~300 Myr by modeling individual stars and their feedback processes. By incorporating chemical yields from individual stars, Aeos generates galaxies with diverse stellar chemical abundances, linking them to hierarchical galaxy formation and early nucleosynthetic events. These simulations underscore the importance of chemical abundance patterns in ancient stars as vital probes of early nucleosynthesis, star formation histories, and galaxy formation. We examine the metallicity floors of various elements resulting from Population III enrichment, providing best-fit values for eight different metals (e.g., [O/H] = −4.0) to guide simulations without Population III models. Additionally, we identify galaxies that begin star formation with Population II after external enrichment and investigate the frequency of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars at varying metallicities. The Aeos simulations offer detailed insights into the relationship between star formation, feedback, and chemical enrichment. Future work will extend these simulations to later epochs to interpret the diverse stellar populations of the Milky Way and its satellites.

<title>The Dynamical History of HIP-41378 f—Oblique Exorings Masquerading as a Puffy Planet</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada4b2</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The super-puff HIP-41378 f represents a fascinating puzzle due to its anomalously low density on a far-out orbit in contrast with other known super-puffs. In this work, we explore the hypothesis that HIP-41378 f is not in fact a low-density planet, but rather hosts an opaque ring system. We analyze the dynamical history of the system and show that convergent migration is necessary to explain the system's long-term stability. We then show that this same migration process plausibly captures HIP-41378 f into spin–orbit resonance and excites the planetary obliquity to high values. This tilts the surrounding ring and is a plausible explanation for the large transit depth. In the end, we also briefly comment on the likelihood of other super-puff planets being in high-obliquity states. We show that the existence of a tilted extensive ring around a high obliquity planet can serve as an explanation for puffy planets, particularly in multiplanetary systems at far distances from their host stars.

<title>Systematic Search for Long-term Trends in Fermi-LAT Jetted Active Galactic Nuclei</title>

Jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) exhibit variability across a wide range of timescales. Traditionally, this variability can often be modeled well as a stochastic process. However, in certain cases, jetted AGN variability displays regular patterns, enabling us to conduct investigations aimed at understanding its origins. Additionally, a novel type of variability has emerged in jetted AGN light curves, specifically, the observation of a long-term trend characterized by a linear increase of the flux with time in blazars such as PG 1553+113, which is among the objects most likely to display periodic behavior. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic search for long-term trends, spanning ≈10 yr, utilizing 12 yr of Fermi-LAT observations. The study is focused on detecting the presence of linear or quadratic long-term trends in a sample of 3308 jetted AGN. Our analysis has identified 40 jetted AGN that exhibit long-term trends, each with distinct properties, which we also characterize in this study. These long-term trends may originate from the dynamics of a supermassive black hole binary system, or they could be the result of intrinsic phenomena within the jet itself. Our findings can help in addressing questions pertaining to the astrophysical origins of variability and periodicity within jetted AGN.

<title>Autoencoder Reconstruction of Cosmological Microlensing Magnification Maps</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada5ff</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Enhanced modeling of microlensing variations in light curves of strongly lensed quasars improves measurements of cosmological time delays, the Hubble Constant, and quasar structure. Traditional methods for modeling extragalactic microlensing rely on computationally expensive magnification map generation. With large data sets expected from wide-field surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time, including thousands of lensed quasars and hundreds of multiply imaged supernovae, faster approaches become essential. We introduce a deep-learning model that is trained on pre-computed magnification maps covering the parameter space on a grid of κ, γ, and s. Our autoencoder creates a low-dimensional latent space representation of these maps, enabling efficient map generation. Quantifying the performance of magnification map generation from a low dimensional space is an essential step in the roadmap to develop neural network-based models that can replace traditional feed-forward simulation at much lower computational costs. We develop metrics to study various aspects of the autoencoder generated maps and show that the reconstruction is reliable. Even though we observe a mild loss of resolution in the generated maps, we find this effect to be smaller than the smoothing effect of convolving the original map with a source of a plausible size for its accretion disk in the red end of the optical spectrum and larger wavelengths and particularly one suitable for studying the broad-line region of quasars. Used to generate large samples of on-demand magnification maps, our model can enable fast modeling of microlensing variability in lensed quasars and supernovae.

<title>The Sunburst Arc with JWST. III. An Abundance of Direct Chemical Abundances</title>

We measure the gas-phase abundances of the elements He, N, O, Ne, S, Ar, and Fe in an individual H ii region known to be leaking Lyman-continuum photons in the Sunburst Arc, a highly magnified galaxy at redshift z = 2.37. We detect the temperature-sensitive auroral lines [S ii] λλ4070, 4076, [O iii] λ4363, [S iii] λ6314, [O ii] λλ7320, 7330, and [Ne iii] λ3343 in a stacked spectrum of five multiple images of the Lyman-continuum emitter (LCE), from which we directly measure the electron temperature in the low-, intermediate-, and high-ionization zones. We also detect the density-sensitive doublets of [O ii] λλ3727, 3730, [S ii] λλ6718, 6733, and [Ar iv] λλ4713, 4741, which constrain the density in both the low- and high-ionization gas. With these temperature and density measurements, we measure gas-phase abundances with similar rigor as studies of local galaxies and H ii regions. We measure a gas-phase metallicity for the LCE of , and find an enhanced nitrogen abundance . This nitrogen abundance is consistent with enrichment from a population of Wolf–Rayet stars, additional signatures of which are reported in a companion paper. Abundances of sulfur, argon, neon, and iron are consistent with local low-metallicity H ii regions and low-redshift galaxies. This study represents the most complete chemical abundance analysis of an individual H ii region at Cosmic Noon to date, which enables direct comparisons between local H ii regions and those in the distant Universe.

<title>The Quest for a Stable Disk</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The majority of disk galaxies manifest spirals and/or bars that are believed to result from dynamical instabilities. However, some galaxies have featureless disks, which are therefore inferred to be dynamically stable. Yet despite many years of effort, theorists have been unable to construct realistic models of galaxy disks that possess no instabilities and therefore could remain featureless. This conclusion has been reached through simulations for the most part, some of which have been confirmed by linear stability analyses. A. Toomre (1981) claimed that the Mestel disk, embedded in an equal-mass halo, is a notable counterexample, but his prediction of stability could not be reproduced in simulations, due to complicated nonlinear effects that caused secular growth of Poisson noise–driven disturbances until strong features emerged. Here, we revisit this issue and show that simply eliminating the most nearly circular orbits from Toomre's disk model can inhibit troublesome secular growth. We also present both 2D and 3D simulations of particle disks that remain featureless for over 50 orbit periods. We report that spiral evolution naturally depletes circular orbits and that the radial velocity distribution in the featureless disks of S0 galaxies should have negative kurtosis.

Gaia has revealed a clear signal of disequilibrium in the solar neighborhood in the form of a spiral (or snail) feature in the vertical phase-space distribution. We investigate the possibility that this structure emerges from ongoing perturbations by dark Galactic subhalos. We develop a probabilistic model for generating subhalo orbits based on a semianalytic model of structure formation, and combine this framework with an approximate prescription for calculating the response of the disk to external perturbations. We also develop a phenomenological treatment for the diffusion of phase-space spirals caused by gravitational scattering between stars and giant molecular clouds, a process that erases the kinematic signatures of old (t ≳ 0.6 Gyr) events. Perturbations caused by dark subhalos are, on average, orders of magnitude weaker than those caused by luminous satellite galaxies, but the ubiquity of dark halos predicted by cold dark matter makes them a more probable source of strong perturbation to the dynamics of the solar neighborhood. Dark subhalos alone do not cause enough disturbance to explain the Gaia snail, but they excite fluctuations of ∼0.1–0.5 km s−1 in the mean vertical velocity of stars near the Galactic midplane that should persist to the present day. Subhalos also produce correlations between vertical frequency and orbital angle that could be mistaken as originating from a single past disturbance. Our results motivate investigation of the Milky Way's dark satellites by characterizing their kinematic signatures in phase-space spirals across the Galaxy.

<title>Tracking Outflow Using Line Locking (TOLL). II. Large Line-locking Web Identified in Quasar J151352+085555</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Quasar outflows often consist of two clouds with velocity separations matching the doublet spacings of common UV resonance transitions, a phenomenon known as line locking, which is commonly observed in quasar spectra. Multiple clouds can be locked together through multi-ion doublets, forming a “line-locking web.” In the second paper of the TOLL project, we present the discovery of one of the largest “line-locking webs” known to date from the Very Large Telescope UVES spectra of QSO J151352+085555. We identify 12 associated narrow absorption line systems through the C iv, N v, Si iv, O vi, and multiple Lyman lines (Lyα to Lyϵ) and find 10 out of the 12 absorbers are line-locked together by comparing velocity separations between different absorption systems. By conducting photoionization modeling with CLOUDY, we measure the total hydrogen column densities, metallicities, and ionization parameters of these absorbers, which suggests that the absorbers likely have subsolar metallicities. A preliminary statistical analysis demonstrates that the shadowed clouds tend to have similar ionization states compared to the shadowing ones. Identification of one of the largest line-locking webs implies that radiative acceleration plays an important role in sorting out cloud velocities in quasar outflows and highlights the need for more sophisticated theoretical models to explain its formation and evolution.

<title>Stellar X-Ray Variability and Planetary Evolution in the DS Tucanae System</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada948</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present an analysis of four Chandra observations of the 45 Myr old DS Tuc binary system. We observed X-ray variability of both stars on timescales from hours to months, including two strong X-ray flares from star A. The implied flaring rates are in agreement with past observations made with XMM-Newton, though these rates remain imprecise due to the relatively short total observation time. We find a clear, monotonic decline in the quiescent level of the star by a factor of 1.8 across 8 months, suggesting stellar variability that might be due to an activity cycle. If proven through future observations, DS Tuc A would be the youngest star for which a coronal activity cycle has been confirmed. The variation in our flux measurements across the four visits is also consistent with the scatter in empirical stellar X-ray relationships with Rossby number. In simulations of the possible evolution of the currently super-Neptune-sized planet DS Tuc A b, we find a range of scenarios for the planet once it reaches a typical field age of 5 Gyr, from Neptune size down to a completely stripped super-Earth. Improved constraints on the planet's mass in the future would significantly narrow these possibilities. We advocate for further Chandra observations to better constrain the variability of this important system.

<title>Retracing the Cold Plasma Dispersion Law in Pulsar B0329+54: New Insights into Frequency-dependent Dispersion Measures</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Multiple studies have investigated potential frequency-dependent dispersion measures (DMs) in PSR B0329+54, with sensitivities at levels of 10−3 pc cm−3 or higher, using frequencies below 1 GHz. Utilizing the extensive bandwidth of the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, we conducted simultaneous observations of this pulsar across a frequency range of 300–1460 MHz. Our observations reveal a distinct point in the pulse profile of PSR B0329+54 that appears to align remarkably well with the cold-plasma dispersion law, resulting in a unique measured DM across the entire frequency range. In contrast, using times of arrival from widely adopted pulsar timing techniques (e.g., FFTFIT) leads to frequency-dependent DMs. We investigated the potential causes of these frequency-dependent DMs in this pulsar and their relationship with the underlying magnetic field geometry corresponding to the radio emission. Our study reveals that all frequencies in the range 300–1460 MHz originate from a region no larger than 204 km, and the dipolar magnetic-field geometry model indicates that the emission region is centered at ~800 km from the star. This is the tightest constraint on the size of the emission region reported so far for PSR B0329+54 at the given frequencies, and it is at least 5 times more stringent than the existing emission height constraints based on the dipolar geometry model.

<title>FEASTS: Radial Distribution of H i Surface Densities Down to 0.01 M ⊙ pc−2 of 35 Nearby Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the H i surface density (ΣH i) radial distributions based on total-power H i images obtained by FAST in the FEASTS program, for 35 galaxies with inclinations lower than 72°. We derive the H i radius R001, which is the radius for the 0.01 M⊙ pc−2 (~1018.1 cm−2) isodensity level, 100 times deeper than the 1 M⊙ pc−2 level previously commonly used to measure R1. The profile shapes show a large diversity at a given radius in units of kpc, group virial radius, and R1, but they align more tightly with the radius normalized by R001. The universal H i profile has a scatter of ~0.2 dex and a scale length of ~0.11R001 in the outer region. We derive a new R001–MH i relation, which has a scatter of 0.03 dex and a similar slope of ~0.5 to the previously known R1–MH i relation. Excluding strongly tidal-interacting galaxies, the ratio R001/R1 (anti)correlates strongly and significantly with the H i-to-stellar mass ratio and specific star formation rate, but not with the stellar mass, MH i, dark matter mass, or star formation rate. The strongly tidal-interacting galaxies tend to show deviations from these trends and have the most flattened profiles. These results imply that, in the absence of major tidal interactions, physical processes must cooperate so that ΣH i distributes in a self-similar way in the outer region down to the 0.01 M⊙ pc−2 level. Moreover, they may drive gas flows in such a way that H i-richer galaxies have H i disks that not only extend further but also transport H i inward more efficiently from R001 to R1.

This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of the Interstellar Boundary Explorer energetic neutral atom (ENA) ribbon, focusing on its spatial and temporal variations over 14 yr. Methodological advancements, including a refined map modeling procedure and a new ribbon separation technique with appropriate error propagation, enable a detailed investigation of the ribbon’s features. Utilizing statistically robust metrics, this study reveals details of the ribbon across energy and time. Key findings include energy- and time-dependent variations in flux, angular radius, ribbon profile width, and higher moments. By applying these metrics, we reveal new complexity to the evolution of the ribbon over time, highlighting the nuanced relationship between it and the solar wind. Furthermore, the study examines for the first time the ribbon as it passes through the starboard/heliotail region (LonEC 120°–180°), revealing properties distinct from other portions of the ribbon. The analysis uncovers an anticorrelation between ribbon width and flux, which provides quantitative support for a multisource ribbon created by a combination of solar wind neutrals that generate a spatiall narrow ribbon component and heliosheath neutrals giving rise to a broad component. Finally, differences in the temporal evolution of the ENA flux at different energies provide additional support that the location of the ribbon source region is beyond the heliopause.

<title>A UV to X-Ray View of Soft Excess in Type 1 Active Galactic Nuclei. I. Sample Selection and Spectral Profile</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A core sample of 59 unobscured type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with simultaneous XMM-Newton X-ray and UV observations is compiled from the archives to probe the nature of soft X-ray excess (SE). In the first paper of this series, our focus centers on scrutinizing the spectral profile of the soft excess. Of the sources, ≈71% (42/59) exhibit power-law-like (po-like) soft excess, while ≈29% (17/59) exhibit blackbody-like (bb-like) soft excess. We show that a cutoff power law could uniformly characterize both types of soft excesses, with a median Ecut of 1.40 keV for po-like and 0.14 keV for bb-like. For the first time, we report a robust and quantitative correlation between the SE profile and SE strength (the ratio of SE luminosity to that of the primary power-law continuum in 0.5–2.0 keV), indicating that stronger soft excess is more likely to be po-like, or effectively has a higher Ecut. This correlation cannot be explained by ionized disk reflection alone, which produces mostly bb-like soft excess (Ecut ~ 0.1 keV) as revealed by relxilllp simulation. Remarkably, we show with simulations that a toy hybrid scenario, where both ionized disk reflection (relxilllp, with all reflection parameters fixed at default values except for ionization of the disk) and warm corona (compTT, with temperature fixed at 1 keV) contribute to the observed soft excess, can successfully reproduce the observed correlation. This highlights the ubiquitous hybrid nature of the SE in AGNs, and underscores the importance of considering both components while fitting the spectra of soft excess.

<title>Residual Energy and Broken Symmetry in Reduced Magnetohydrodynamics</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Alfvénic interactions that transfer energy from large to small spatial scales lie at the heart of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. An important feature of the turbulence is the generation of negative residual energy—excess energy in magnetic fluctuations compared to velocity fluctuations. By contrast, an MHD Alfvén wave has equal amounts of energy in fluctuations of each type. Alfvénic quasi-modes that do not satisfy the Alfvén wave dispersion relation and exist only in the presence of a nonlinear term can contain either positive or negative residual energy, but until now, an intuitive physical explanation for why negative residual energy is preferred has remained elusive. This paper shows that the equations of reduced MHD are symmetric in that they have no intrinsic preference for one sign of the residual energy over the other. An initial state that is not an exact solution to the equations can break this symmetry in a way that leads to net-negative residual energy generation. Such a state leads to a solution with three distinct parts: nonresonant Alfvénic quasi-modes, normal modes produced to satisfy initial conditions, and resonant normal modes that grow in time. The latter two parts strongly depend on initial conditions; the resulting symmetry breaking leads to net-negative residual energy both in Alfvénic quasi-modes and ω = k∥VA = 0 modes. These modes have net-positive residual energy in the equivalent boundary value problem, suggesting that the initial value setup is a better match for solar wind turbulence.

<title>Revisiting the Flaring Activity in Early 2015 of BL Lacertae Object S5 0716+714</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this work, we analyzed multiwavelength data of the BL Lac object S5 0716+714 to investigate its emission mechanisms during a flaring state observed in early 2015. We examined the temporal behavior and broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) during the flare. The size of the γ-ray emission region was estimated based on the variability timescale. To explore the multiwavelength properties of S5 0716+714, we employed three one-zone models: the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model, the SSC plus external Compton (EC) model, and the SSC plus pp interactions model, to reproduce the SEDs. Our findings indicate that, while the SSC model can describe the SEDs, it requires an extreme Doppler factor. In contrast, the SSC plus EC model successfully fits the SEDs under the assumption of weak external photon fields but requires a high Doppler factor. Additionally, the SSC plus pp interactions model also reproduces the SEDs, with γ-ray emission originating from π0 decay. However, this model leads to a jet power that exceeds the Eddington luminosity, which remains plausible due to the flaring state or the presence of a highly collimated jet.

<title>Bulge Oscillation Driven by Outflows of Active Galactic Nuclei. I. Fast Outflow Case</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
There is growing evidence for star formation inside outflows of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The formed stars are injected into bulges and give rise to perturbation of bulges. In this paper, we investigate the issues of nonrotating, spherically symmetric bulges under the perturbation of fast, massive outflows with stars formed inside. We show that the potential perturbation of outflows, together with injection and dynamical friction of these stars, could drive bulge oscillations. Still, we find that nonzero radial velocity of bulges will be driven by the episodic outflows of AGNs, and after the AGN has quenched, the radial velocity will tend to zero within a timescale ~τAGN, which is the AGN's lifetime. For some typical values of bulges and AGNs, we find that the expansion and contraction velocities are a few × 10 km s−1 for 1010M⊙ bulges and mass outflowing rate 500 M⊙ yr−1, which would give observational signatures.

<title>Improving the Determination of Supernova Cosmological Redshifts by Using Galaxy Groups</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
At the low-redshift end (z < 0.05) of the Hubble diagram with Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), the contribution to Hubble residual scatter from peculiar velocities (PVs) is of similar size to that due to the limitations of the standardization of the SN Ia light curves. A way to improve the redshift measurement of the SN host galaxy is to utilize the average redshift of the galaxy group, effectively averaging over small-scale/intracluster PVs. One limiting factor is the fraction of SN host galaxies in galaxy groups, previously found to be 30% using (relatively incomplete) magnitude-limited galaxy catalogs. Here, we do the first analysis of N-body simulations to predict this fraction, finding ∼73% should have associated groups and group averaging should improve redshift precision by ∼135 km s−1 (∼0.04 mag at z = 0.025). Furthermore, using spectroscopic data from the Anglo-Australian Telescope, we present results from the first pilot program to evaluate whether or not 23 previously unassociated SN Ia hosts belong in groups. We find that 91% of these candidates can be associated with groups, consistent with predictions from simulations given the sample size. Combining with previously assigned SN host galaxies in Pantheon+, we demonstrate improvement in Hubble residual scatter equivalent to 145 km s−1, also consistent with simulations. For new and upcoming low-z samples from, for example, the Zwicky Transient Facility and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, a separate follow-up program identifying galaxy groups of SN hosts is a highly cost-effective way to enhance their constraining power.

<title>Vertical Shear Instability in Thermally Stratified Protoplanetary Disks. I. A Linear Stability Analysis</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9f41</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Vertical shear instability (VSI), driven by a vertical gradient of rotational angular velocity, is a promising source of turbulence in protoplanetary disks. We examine the semiglobal stability of thermally stratified disks and find that the VSI consists of surface and body modes: surface modes are confined to regions of strong shear, while body modes extend perturbations across the disk, consistent with the previous findings. In thermally stratified disks, surface modes bifurcate into two branches. The branch associated with the strongest shear at mid-height exhibits a higher growth rate compared to the branch near the surfaces. Surface modes generally grow rapidly and require a high radial wavenumber kR, whereas body mode growth rates increase as kR decreases. Thermal stratification enhances the growth rates of both surface and body modes and boosts VSI-driven radial kinetic energy relative to vertical energy. Our results suggest that simulations will initially favor surface modes with large kR, followed by an increase in body modes with smaller kR, with faster progression in more thermal stratified disks.

<title>Vertical Shear Instability in Thermally Stratified Protoplanetary Disks. II. Hydrodynamic Simulations and Observability</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We conduct 3D hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the nonlinear outcomes and observability of vertical shear instability (VSI) in protoplanetary disks. Our models include both vertically isothermal and thermally stratified disks, with the latter representing realistic conditions featuring a hotter atmosphere above the midplane. We find that the VSI grows more rapidly and becomes stronger in thermally stratified disks due to enhanced shear, resulting in higher levels of turbulence. At saturation, the turbulence stress reaches αRϕ ≳ 10−3, more than 1 order of magnitude stronger than the isothermal case. The saturated turbulence is more pronounced near the disk surfaces than at the midplane. On synthetic velocity residual maps, obtained by subtracting the Keplerian rotational velocity, perturbations driven by the VSI manifest as axisymmetric rings in isothermal disks and as ring segments in thermally stratified disks. The latter are visible at disk inclinations as high as 45° in thermally stratified disks. The amplitudes of these residual velocities range from ∼50 to ∼100 m s−1 at a 20° inclination, with larger values corresponding to greater thermal stratification. The magnitude of the observed velocity residual increases with the optical depth of the tracer used, as optically thick lines probe the regions near the disk surfaces.

<title>Pushing the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array to the Limit: 140 pc Resolution Observations of a z = 6.6 Quasar–Galaxy Merger Resolve Strikingly Different Morphologies of Dust Continuum and [C ii] 158 μm Emission</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present (140 pc) resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of [C ii] 158 μm and dust continuum emission of the z = 6.6 quasar J0305–3150, resolved over ~300–400 independent resolution elements. The dust continuum emission is compact with ~80% recovered within (1.6 kpc), whereas the [C ii] emission profile is composed of a central Gaussian ( , i.e., <2.2 kpc) and an extended component (detected up to ~10 kpc at >3σ). We infer a direct contribution of the quasar to the observed 260 GHz continuum Sν,QSO/Sν,QSO + Host ≲ 1%. We report the detection of far-infrared (FIR)-detected star-forming clumps with r < 200 pc and properties similar to that of rest-frame UV–optical clumps reported in the literature. The 200 pc resolved [C ii]/FIR ratio follows the global relation with the FIR surface brightness established in low- and high-redshift galaxies, even at the quasar location. We find that dust continuum is emitted in regions of consistent with the size of photodissociation regions (PDRs), whereas 50% of the [C ii] originates from larger physical scales (θ ≳ 2″). The large-scale [C ii] emission presents a velocity gradient aligned with a nearby companion with perturbed kinematics, and misaligned with the kinematics of the small-scale emission. The absence of significant [C ii] emission by structures with physical scale ≲ 1 kpc implies that [C ii] emission is not produced in dense PDRs located at the boundary of giant molecular clouds. We argue instead that [C ii] is produced in low-density PDRs in the interstellar medium and diffuse H i gas tidally stripped during the ongoing merger.

<title>The Eruptive Duality of a Filament on 2023 April 21</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Here we study a filament eruption on 2023 April 21. The filament was composed of two segments, named S1 and S2. Initially, the brightening and bidirectionally plasmoid flows appeared inside S1, and then the west part of S1 (WS1) experienced rapid rising and eruption, accompanied by coronal dimming, flare ribbons, and a secondary flare ribbon. However, the east part of S1 (ES1) rose slowly and was confined. The material within ES1 drained back to its eastern footpoint, resulting in the footpoint brightening. In the later phase, the south footpoint of the stable extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) loops overlying ES1 was brightened also, which may result from the disturbance of drainage. During S1 eruption and activation, S2 remained stable. Nonlinear force-free field extrapolation shows that the footpoints of the magnetic field lines overlying WS1 are rooted on the flare ribbons, while the field lines overlying ES1, which share a negative field with other lines, correspond to the stable EUV loops. Based on potential field extrapolation, we calculate the decay index of the background fields overlying the filament. It indicates that the critical height of the torus instability of the fields overlying WS1 is lower than that overlying ES1. To interpret this filament eruption, we first put forward the eruptive duality, characterized by the eruption of the partial filament structure and the confinement of the other structure, and this duality is determined by the properties of the overlying fields.

<title>Contribution of Unresolved Sources to Diffuse Gamma-Ray Emission from the Galactic Plane</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The diffuse gamma-ray emission from the Milky Way serves as a crucial probe for understanding the propagation and interactions of cosmic rays within our Galaxy. The Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission between 10 TeV and 1 PeV has been recently measured by the square kilometer array (KM2A) of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). The flux is higher than predicted for cosmic rays interacting with the interstellar medium. In this work, we utilize a nonparametric method to derive the source count distribution using the published first LHAASO source catalog. Based on this distribution, we calculate the contribution of unresolved sources to the diffuse emission measured by KM2A. When comparing our results to the measured diffuse gamma-ray emission, we demonstrate that for the outer Galactic region, the contributions from unresolved sources and those predicted by models are roughly consistent with the observations within the uncertainties. However, for the inner Galactic region, additional components are required to account for the observed data.

<title>Coordinated Velocity Shift of Multiple C iv and Si iv Broad Absorption Lines in Quasar SDSS J113048.45+225206.6</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present an analysis of the coordinated velocity shifts observed in multiple C iv and Si iv broad absorption lines (BALs) in the quasar SDSS J113048.45+225206.6. The quasar exhibits an extensive BAL system spanning a velocity range of approximately 13,000 km s−1, which can be further delineated into five absorption systems (A1 to A5). Our analysis revealed coordinated velocity shifts in the C iv BALs of systems A1 and A2 and in the Si iv BALs of systems A2 and A3. These shifts were accompanied by coordinated variations in equivalent widths, which can be attributed to changes in the ionization state of the clouds in response to fluctuations in the ionizing continuum. By comparing the absorption line systems, we deduced that the velocity-shifted systems (A1 to A3) are located closer to the central engine, possess higher velocities, and are in a higher ionization state compared to the nonshifted systems (A4 to A5). These characteristics suggest that the outflow producing the velocity-shifted systems is situated in a more extreme environment and is more severely impacted by background radiation energy than the nonshifted systems. Furthermore, the synchronization of these velocity shifts across multiple components suggests a common underlying mechanism. Consequently, we infer that the coordinated velocity-shift signatures may indicate actual deceleration of the outflow clouds, driven by radiation pressure from the background light source.

<title>Rare Occasions: Tidal Disruption Events Rarely Power the AGNs Observed in Dwarf Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Tidal disruption events (TDEs) could be an important growth channel for massive black holes in dwarf galaxies. Theoretical work suggests that the observed active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dwarf galaxies are predominantly TDE-powered. To assess this claim, we perform variability analyses on the dwarf-hosted AGNs detected in the 7 Ms Chandra Deep Field-South survey, with observations spanning ≈16 yr. Based on the spectral energy distribution modeling with x-cigale, we select AGNs hosted by dwarf galaxies (stellar mass below 1010M⊙). We focus on X-ray sources with full-band detections, leading to a sample of 78 AGNs (0.122 ≤ z ≤ 3.515). We fit the X-ray light curves with a canonical TDE model of t−5/3 and a constant model. If the former outperforms the latter in fitting quality for a source, we consider the source as a potential TDE. We identify five potential TDEs, constituting a small fraction of our sample. Using true- and false-positive rates obtained from fitting models to simulated light curves, we perform Bayesian analysis to obtain the posterior of the TDE fraction for our sample. The posterior peaks close to zero (2.56%), and we obtain a 2σ upper limit of 9.80%. Therefore, our result indicates that the observed AGNs in dwarf galaxies are not predominantly powered by TDEs.

We present a stringent measurement of the dust-obscured star formation rate density (SFRD) at z = 4–6 from the ASPIRE JWST Cycle-1 medium and ALMA Cycle-9 large program. We obtained JWST/NIRCam grism spectroscopy and ALMA 1.2 mm continuum map along 25 independent quasar sightlines, covering a total survey area of ∼35 arcmin2 where we search for dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at z = 0–7. We identify eight DSFGs in seven fields at z = 4–6 through the detection of Hα or [O iii] λ5008 lines, including fainter lines such as Hβ, [O iii] λ4960, [N ii] λ6585, and [S ii] λλ6718,6733 for six sources. With this spectroscopically complete DSFG sample at z = 4–6 and negligible impact from cosmic variance (shot noise), we measure the infrared luminosity function (IRLF) down to LIR ∼ 2 × 1011L⊙. We find flattening of IRLF at z = 4–6 towards the faint end (power-law slope ). We determine the dust-obscured cosmic SFRD at this epoch to be . This is significantly higher than previous determinations using ALMA data in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, which is void of DSFGs at z = 4–6 because of strong cosmic variance (shot noise). We conclude that the majority (66% ± 7%) of cosmic star formation at z ∼ 5 is still obscured by dust. We also discuss the uncertainty of SFRD propagated from far-IR spectral energy distribution and IRLF at the bright end, which will need to be resolved with future ALMA and JWST observations.

<title>UNCOVER: The Rest-ultraviolet to Near-infrared Multiwavelength Structures and Dust Distributions of Submillimeter-detected Galaxies in A2744</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
With the wavelength coverage, sensitivity, and high spatial resolution of JWST, it is now possible to peer through the dust attenuation to probe the rest-frame near-infrared (NIR) and stellar structures of extremely dusty galaxies at cosmic noon (z ∼ 1−3). In this paper we leverage the combined Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and JWST/Hubble Space Telescope coverage in A2744 to study the multiwavelength (0.5−4.4 μm) structures of 11 submillimeter detected galaxies at z ∼ 0.9−3.5 that are fainter than bright “classical” submillimeter galaxies, seven of which are detected in deep X-ray data. While these objects reveal a diversity of structures and sizes, all are smaller and more concentrated toward longer wavelengths. Of the X-ray-detected objects, only two show evidence for appreciable active galactic nucleus (AGN) flux contributions (at ≳2 μm). Excluding the two AGN-dominated objects, the smaller long-wavelength sizes indicate that their rest-frame NIR light profiles, inferred to trace their stellar mass profiles, are more compact than their optical profiles. The submillimeter detections and visible dust lanes suggest that centrally concentrated dust is a key driver of the observed color gradients. Further, we find that more concentrated galaxies tend to have lower size ratios (rest-frame NIR to optical); this suggests that the galaxies with the most compact light distributions also have the most concentrated dust. The 1.2 mm flux densities and size ratios of these nine objects suggest that both total dust quantity and geometry impact these galaxies’ multiwavelength structures. Upcoming higher-resolution 1.2 mm ALMA imaging will facilitate joint spatially resolved analysis and will directly test the dust distributions within this representative submillimeter population.

<title>Simulating High-redshift Galaxies: Enhancing UV Luminosity with Star Formation Efficiency and a Top-heavy IMF</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada27d</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada27d</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent findings from photometric and spectroscopic JWST surveys have identified examples of high-redshift galaxies at z ≳ 10. These high-z galaxies appear to form much earlier and exhibit greater UV luminosity than predicted by theoretical work. In this study, our goal is to reproduce the brightness of these sources by simulating high-redshift galaxies with virial masses Mvir = 109–1010M⊙ at z > 10. To achieve this, we conduct cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations, modifying baryonic subgrid physics, and post-process our simulation results to confirm the observability of our simulated galaxies. Specifically, we enhanced star formation activity in high-redshift galaxies by either increasing the star formation efficiency up to 100% or adopting a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF). Our simulation results indicate that both increasing star formation efficiency and adopting a top-heavy IMF play crucial roles in boosting the UV luminosity of high-redshift galaxies, potentially exceeding the limiting magnitude of JWST surveys in earlier epochs. In particular, the episodic starburst resulting from enhanced star formation efficiency may explain the high-redshift galaxies observed by JWST, as it evacuates dust from star-forming regions, making the galaxies more observable. We demonstrate this correlation between star formation activity and dust mass evolution within the simulated galaxies. Also, adopting a top-heavy IMF could enhance observability due to an overabundance of massive stars, although it may also facilitate rapid metal enrichment. Using our simulation results, we derive several observables such as effective radius, UV slope, and emission-line rates, which could serve as valuable theoretical estimates for comparison with existing spectroscopic results and forthcoming data from the JWST NIRSpec and MIRI instruments.

<title>Similarities and Differences between ICME-driven Shocks Observed by VEX (∼0.72 au) and WIND (∼1.0 au)</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The features of interplanetary shocks driven by interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) observed by WIND (∼1.0 au) and Venus Express (VEX; ∼0.72 au) during the same period are statistically analyzed by comparing their similarities and differences. It is found that the proportion of ICME-driven shocks in all shocks decreases slightly from ∼0.72 to ∼1 au. The yearly occurrence of ICME-driven shocks at both ∼0.72 and ∼1 au roughly follows the sunspot cycle, while the magnetic field ratio does not show such a correspondence. In each year, the annual medians of the shock angle for ICME-driven shocks at ∼1 au are consistently larger than those at ∼0.72 au, and the annual medians of the magnetic field ratio for events at ∼1 au are slightly smaller than those at ∼0.72 au. Planar magnetic structures (PMSs) downstream of ICME-driven shocks are also analyzed. Approximately 28.57% of the detected PMS events from VEX observations and 28.84% from WIND observations cover the entire 2 hr intervals downstream of the shocks, which are referred to as full PMS events. Through comparative analysis for VEX and WIND observations, it is found that strong and quasi-perpendicular ICME-driven shocks are the most preferable conditions for full PMS formation.

<title>Jupiter Evolutionary Models Incorporating Stably Stratified Regions</title>

We address the issue of which broad set of initial conditions for the planet Jupiter best matches the current presence of a “fuzzy core” of heavy elements, while at the same time comporting with measured parameters such as its effective temperature, atmospheric helium abundance, radius, and atmospheric metallicity. Our focus is on the class of fuzzy cores that can survive convective mixing to the present day and on the unique challenges of an inhomogeneous Jupiter with stably stratified regions now demanded by the Juno gravity data. Hence, using the new code APPLE, we attempt to put a nonadiabatic Jupiter into an evolutionary context. This requires not only a mass density model, the major relevant byproduct of the Juno data, but a thermal model that is subject to interior heat transport, a realistic atmospheric flux boundary, a helium rain algorithm, and the latest equation of state. The result is a good fit to most major thermal, compositional, and structural constraints that still preserve a fuzzy core and that should inform future more detailed models of the current Jupiter in the context of its evolution from birth.

<title>Resonant Damping and Instability of Propagating Magnetohydrodynamic Body Modes in a Flux Tube with Shear Flow under Photospheric Conditions</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada7f7</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The influence of shear flow on resonant absorption is theoretically investigated for propagating magnetohydrodynamic body modes in cusp (slow) and Alfvén continua in a cylindrical flux tube under photospheric conditions. An analytical dispersion relation for resonant absorption in the presence of flow shear is developed by assuming a thin boundary layer. The numerical solutions reveal that the presence of flow shear has a rather negative impact on the resonant absorption of the body mode compared to the surface modes. As the flow shear increases, it first slightly increases the strength of resonant absorption for the forward body modes and then decreases it below the strength of no flow shear case for both resonances. It is also found that as the flow shear increases, the range of the axial wavenumber and wave frequency for the cusp resonance decreases when the wave frequency is close to the upper boundary of the cusp continuum. For the backward body modes, the strength of the resonance absorption decreases with the increment of the flow shear. When the flow shear is sufficiently large, the waves propagate in the forward direction, and their amplitude grows with a small increment.

<title>Propagating Bright Knots in the Chromospheric Fibrils</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada7fa</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The solar chromosphere is a crucial layer for resolving the problem of atmospheric heating. There are many bright features, which are considered as the thermal signals for heating the atmosphere, and these features are suggested to have resulted from either magnetic reconnection or wave dissipation. It has been reported that a large number of propagating bright knots are detected in the chromosphere and corona. In this paper, we employ the high-resolution chromospheric Hα data from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope to study the propagating bright knots. As the propagating bright knots move along the chromospheric fibrils, we select isolated and clear fibrils and track the knots along these fibrils. While the number of knots in a fibril region is equal to or greater than 5, the fibril and the knots are recorded. Based on the data on 2019 September 4, we detected 98 knots, and these knots move along 13 fibrils. On 2019 November 2, 87 knots, which move along 12 fibrils, were recorded. These propagating bright knots have an average area of around 0.8 Mm2, with propagating distances from 190 to 2450 km, propagating velocities from 5 to 51 km s−1, and an average lifetime of 71 s. To examine the relationship between the knots and the photospheric magnetic fields, we measure the field underneath these knots. The average magnetic flux densities are less than 10 Gauss, comparable with the noise level. We suggest that these knots are not produced by magnetic reconnection, but rather by wave dissipation.

<title>Observations of the Ultraviolet-bright Star III-60 in the Globular Cluster NGC 6723</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have analyzed archival far-ultraviolet spectra of the UV-bright star III-60 in the globular cluster NGC 6723 obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer and the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph. We find that the star's photospheric parameters (effective temperature Teff = 44,800 ± 1200 K, surface gravity , and helium abundance ) are consistent with the values derived from its optical spectrum, suggesting that optically derived values are generally accurate for evolved stars with Teff ≲ 50,000 K. Relative to the cluster's red giant branch stars, III-60 is enhanced in nitrogen and depleted in carbon and oxygen. The star exhibits strong P Cygni profiles in both components of the N vλ1240 doublet, but the resonance lines of other species show no evidence of a stellar wind. The star's effective temperature and luminosity place it on the evolutionary tracks of stars evolving from the blue horizontal branch, but its high mass (∼1.2 M⊙) indicates that it is the product of a stellar merger. Its helium, carbon, and nitrogen abundances suggest that it is following an evolutionary path similar to that of the low-carbon, intermediate helium-rich hot subdwarfs.

<title>A 22 yr Cycle of the Network Topology of Solar Active Regions</title>

In this paper, solar cycles 21–24 were compared using complex network analysis. A network was constructed for these four solar cycles to facilitate the comparison. In these networks, the nodes represent the active regions of the Sun that emit flares, and the connections correspond to the sequence of solar flares over time. This resulted in a directed network with self-connections allowed. The model proposed by Abe and Suzuki for earthquake networks was followed. The incoming degree for each node was calculated, and the degree distribution was analyzed. It was found that for each solar cycle, the degree distribution follows a power law, indicating that solar flares tend to appear in correlated active zones rather than being evenly distributed. Additionally, a variation in the characteristic exponent γ for each cycle was observed, with higher values in even cycles compared to odd cycles. A more detailed analysis was performed by constructing 11 yr networks and shifting them in 1 yr intervals. This revealed that the characteristic exponent shows a period of approximately 22 yr coincident with the Hale cycle, suggesting that the complex networks provide information about the solar magnetic activity.

<title>Rotating Neutron Stars with Relativistic Ab Initio Calculations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The equation of state (EOS) of extremely dense matter is crucial for understanding the properties of rotating neutron stars. Starting from the widely used realistic Bonn potentials rooted in a relativistic framework, we derive EOSs by performing state-of-the-art relativistic Brueckner–Hartree–Fock calculations in the full Dirac space. The self-consistent and simultaneous consideration of both positive- and negative-energy states (NESs) of the Dirac equation allows us to avoid the uncertainties present in calculations where NESs are treated using approximations. To manifest the impact of rotational dynamics, several structural properties of neutron stars across a wide range of rotation frequencies and up to the Keplerian limit are obtained, including the gravitational and baryonic masses, the polar and equatorial radii, and the moments of inertia. Our theoretical predictions align well with the latest astrophysical constraints from observations of massive neutron stars and joint mass–radius measurements. The maximum mass for rotating configurations can reach up to 2.93 M⊙ for Bonn A potential, while the radius of a 1.4 M⊙ neutron star in the nonrotating case can be extended to around 17 km through constant baryonic mass sequences. Relations with good universalities between the Keplerian frequency and static mass as well as radius are obtained, from which the radius of the black widow PSR J0952-0607 is predicted to be less than 19.58 km. Furthermore, to understand how rotation deforms the equilibrium shape of a neutron star, the eccentricity is also calculated. The approximate universality between the eccentricity at the Keplerian frequency and the gravitational mass is found.

<title>Mach Number Scaling of Foreshock Magnetic Fluctuations at Quasi-parallel Bow Shocks and Their Role in Magnetospheric Driving Throughout the Solar System</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada440</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada440</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Upstream of quasi-parallel bow shocks, reflected ions generate ion–ion instabilities. The resulting magnetic fluctuations can advect through the shock and interact with planetary magnetospheres. The amplitude of magnetic fluctuations depends on the strength of the shock, quantified by the Alfvén Mach number (MA), which is the ratio of solar wind velocity to the local Alfvén velocity. With increasing heliocentric distance, the solar wind MA generally increases, such that Mercury typically experiences a lower MA ∼ 5 compared to Earth (MA ∼ 8), and Mars a slightly higher MA ∼ 9. Farther out in the solar system, Saturn has even higher MA (∼10). However, the solar wind flow is highly irregular, and on top of solar cycle variations these values for average MA at each planet do not capture extreme events. Statistical analysis of OMNIWeb observations from 2015 to 2023 shows that sustained (30 minutes or more) high MA (30–100) occurs at Earth about once a month. Using a selection of events in the ion foreshock regions of Mercury, Earth, Mars, and Saturn, a linear scaling is calculated for the maximum magnetic fluctuation amplitude as a function of MA. The resulting slope is ∼0.2. Based on the dominant fluctuation frequency for the largest-amplitude events at each planet, it is found that Mars exists in a special regime where the wave period of the magnetic fluctuations can be similar to or longer than the magnetospheric convection timescale, making Mars more susceptible to space weather effects associated with foreshock fluctuations.

<title>The Influence of General Relativity on the Spins of Celestial Bodies in Inclined Orbits</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Through the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect, several hot Jupiters have been found to exhibit spin–orbit misalignment and even retrograde orbits. The high obliquity observed in these planets can be attributed to two primary formation mechanisms, as summarized in the existing literature. First, the host star's spin becomes misaligned with the planetary disk during the late stages of star formation, primarily due to chaotic accretion and magnetic interactions between the star and the planetary disk. Second, the orbital inclination of an individual planet can be excited by dynamical processes such as planet–planet scattering, the Lidov–Kozai cycle, and secular chaos within the framework of Newtonian mechanics. This study introduces a third mechanism, where, within the framework of general relativity, the post-Newtonian spin–orbit coupling term induces precession of the host star's spin around the orbital angular momentum. The orbital inclination, relative to a reference plane, can expand the range of deviation in the spatial orientation of the bodies’ spins from the plane's normal. The varying amplitude and period of spin precession for both the star and the planet are derived theoretically, and the results, which can be applied without restriction, agree well with numerical simulations.

<title>The JADES Transient Survey: Discovery and Classification of Supernovae in the JADES Deep Field</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) is a multicycle JWST program that has taken among the deepest near- and mid-infrared images to date (down to ∼30 AB mag) over ∼25 arcmin2 in the GOODS-S field in two sets of observations with 1 yr of separation. This presented the first opportunity to systematically search for transients, mostly supernovae (SNe), out to z > 2. We found 79 SNe: 38 at z < 2, 23 at 2 < z < 3, 8 at 3 < z < 4, 7 at 4 < z < 5, and 3 with undetermined redshifts, where the redshifts are predominantly based on spectroscopic or highly reliable JADES photometric redshifts of the host galaxies. At this depth, the detection rate is ∼1–2 arcmin–2 yr–1, demonstrating the power of JWST as an SN discovery machine. We also conducted multiband follow-up NIRCam observations of a subset of the SNe to better constrain their light curves and classify their types. Here, we present the survey, sample, search parameters, spectral energy distributions, light curves, and classifications. Even at z ≥ 2, the NIRCam data quality is high enough to allow SN classification via multiepoch light-curve fitting with confidence. The multiepoch SN sample includes a Type Ia SN at zspec = 2.90, a Type IIP SN at zspec = 3.61, and a Type Ic-BL SN at zspec = 2.83. We also found that two z ∼ 16 galaxy candidates from the first imaging epoch were actually transients that faded in the second epoch, illustrating the possibility that moderate/high-redshift SNe could mimic high-redshift dropout galaxies.

<title>The Arp 240 Galaxy Merger: A Detailed Look at the Molecular Kennicutt–Schmidt Star Formation Law on Subkiloparsec Scales</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9bab</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9bab</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The molecular Kennicutt–Schmidt Law has been key for understanding star formation (SF) in galaxies across all redshifts. However, recent subkiloparsec observations of nearby galaxies reveal deviations from the nearly unity slope (N) obtained with disk-averaged measurements. We study SF and molecular gas (MG) distribution in the early-stage luminous infrared galaxy merger Arp 240 (NGC 5257-8). Using Very Large Array radio continuum (RC) and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array CO(2–1) observations at 500 pc scale, with a uniform grid analysis, we estimate SF rates and MG surface densities (ΣSFR and , respectively). In Arp 240, N is sublinear at 0.52 ± 0.17. For NGC 5257 and NGC 5258, N is 0.52 ± 0.16 and 0.75 ± 0.15, respectively. We identify two SF regimes: high surface brightness (HSB) regions in RC with N ~ 1, and low surface brightness (LSB) regions with shallow N (ranging 0.15 ± 0.09–0.48 ± 0.04). Median CO(2–1) linewidth and MG turbulent pressure (Pturb) are 25 km s−1 and 9 × 105 K cm−3. No significant correlation was found between ΣSFR and CO(2–1) linewidth. However, ΣSFR correlates with Pturb, particularly in HSB regions (ρ > 0.60). In contrast, SF efficiency moderately anticorrelates with Pturb in LSB regions but shows no correlation in HSB regions. Additionally, we identify regions where peaks in SF and MG are decoupled, yielding a shallow N (≤0.28 ± 0.18). Overall, the range of N reflects distinct physical properties and distribution of both the SF and MG, which can be masked by disk-averaged measurements.

<title>Obliquity Dependence of Ocean Productivity and Atmospheric CO2 on Earth-like Worlds</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada277</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada277</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Obliquity can shape the habitability of a planet by changing the seasonal availability of incident solar radiation. Changes in incident radiation can lead to changes in the availability of light, temperature, ocean circulation, stratification, and corresponding nutrient availability, all of which are important in determining ocean net primary productivity (NPP). Moreover, a fraction of the carbon assimilated by phytoplankton is sequestered in the deep ocean. Therefore, changes in productivity can alter the distribution of CO2 between the ocean and atmosphere. In this study, we investigate the effects of obliquity on ocean NPP and the atmospheric CO2 concentration using ROCKE-3D fully coupled to the NASA GISS Ocean Biogeochemistry Model. We find sea surface temperature primarily controls the NPP response, with both properties reaching a maximum at an obliquity of 45°. We find that the response of the seasonal amplitude of NPP to obliquity is controlled primarily by photosynthetically available radiation and secondarily by changes in nutrient availability. We also find that atmospheric CO2 increases in response to obliquity, with a minimum at 15° and a maximum at 60°. The obliquity-driven CO2 changes are controlled primarily by temperature-driven solubility changes, with circulation and biology either enhancing solubility-driven changes at low obliquities or acting against and partially offsetting solubility-driven changes at higher obliquities. The magnitude of obliquity-driven changes is likely too small to be detectable, though future studies are needed to determine whether changing obliquity simultaneously with other orbital parameters can lead to larger, potentially detectable changes in NPP and CO2.

<title>The Arizona Molecular ISM Survey with the SMT: Variations in the CO(2–1)/CO(1–0) Line Ratio across the Galaxy Population</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The J = 1 → 0 spectral line of carbon monoxide (CO(1–0)) is the canonical tracer of molecular gas. However, CO(2–1) is frequently used in its place, following the assumption that the higher-energy line can be used to infer the CO(1–0) luminosity and molecular gas mass. The use of CO(2–1) depends on a knowledge of the ratio between CO(2–1) and CO(1–0) luminosities, r21. Here, we present galaxy-integrated r21 measurements for 122 galaxies spanning stellar masses from 109 to 1011.5M⊙ and star formation rates (SFRs) from 0.08 to 35 M⊙ yr−1. We find strong trends between r21 and SFR, SFR surface density, star formation efficiency, and distance from the star formation main sequence (SFMS). We show that the assumption of a constant r21 can introduce biases into the molecular gas trends in galaxy population studies and demonstrate how this affects the recovery of important galaxy scaling relations, including the Kennicutt–Schmidt law and the relation between SFMS offset and star formation efficiency. We provide a prescription that accounts for variations in r21 as a function of SFR and can be used to convert between CO(2–1) and CO(1–0) when only one line is available. Our prescription matches variations in r21 for both AMISS and literature samples and can be used to derive more accurate gas masses from CO(2–1) observations.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Irradiated brown dwarfs offer a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between stellar and planetary atmospheres. We present high-quality Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3/G141 phase-resolved spectra of the white dwarf–brown dwarf binary GD 1400, covering more than one full rotation of the brown dwarf. Accounting for brightness variations caused by ZZ Ceti pulsations, we revealed weak (∼1%) phase-curve amplitude modulations originating from the brown dwarf. Subband light-curve exploration in various bands showed no significant wavelength dependence on amplitude or phase shift. Extracted day- and nightside spectra indicated chemically similar hemispheres, with slightly higher dayside temperatures, suggesting efficient heat redistribution or the dominance of radiative escape over atmospheric circulation. A simple radiative and energy redistribution model reproduced the observed temperatures well. Cloud-inclusive models fit the day and night spectra better than cloudless models, indicating global cloud coverage. We also begin qualitatively exploring atmospheric trends across six irradiated brown dwarfs, from the now complete “Dancing with the Dwarfs” white dwarf–brown dwarf sample. The trend we find in the dayside/nightside temperature and irradiation levels is consistent with efficient heat redistribution for irradiation levels less than ∼109 erg s−1 cm−2 and decreasing efficiency above that level.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
JWST has enabled detecting and spatially resolving the heavily dust-attenuated stellar populations of submillimeter galaxies, revealing detail that was previously inaccessible. In this work, we construct a sample of 289 submillimeter galaxies with joint Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and JWST constraints in the COSMOS field. Sources are originally selected using the SCUBA-2 instrument and have archival ALMA observations from various programs. Their JWST NIRCam imaging is from COSMOS-Web and PRIMER. We extract multiwavelength photometry in a manner that leverages the unprecedented near-infrared (NIR) spatial resolution of JWST, and we fit the data with spectral energy distribution models to derive photometric redshifts, stellar masses, star formation rates, and optical attenuation. The sample has an average , , , and . There are 81 (30%) galaxies that have no previous optical/NIR detections, including 75% of the z > 4 subsample (n = 28). The faintest observed NIR sources have the highest redshifts and largest AV = 4 ± 1. In a preliminary morphology analysis we find that ∼10% of the members of our sample exhibit spiral arms and 5% host stellar bars, with one candidate bar found at z > 3. Finally, we find that the clustering of JWST sources within 10″ of a submillimeter galaxy is a factor of 2 greater than what is expected based on either random clustering or the distribution of sources around any red galaxy irrespective of a submillimeter detection.

<title>Carbon and Iron Deficiencies in Quiescent Galaxies at z = 1–3 from JWST-SUSPENSE: Implications for the Formation Histories of Massive Galaxies</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad96b6</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the stellar metallicities and multielement abundances (C, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Fe) of 15 massive (log M/M⊙ = 10.2–11.2) quiescent galaxies at z = 1–3, derived from ultradeep JWST-SUSPENSE spectra. Compared to quiescent galaxies at z ∼ 0, these galaxies exhibit a deficiency of 0.26 ± 0.04 dex in [C/H], 0.16 ± 0.03 dex in [Fe/H], and 0.07 ± 0.04 dex in [Mg/H], implying rapid formation and quenching before significant enrichment from asymptotic giant branch stars and Type Ia supernovae. Additionally, we find that galaxies forming at higher redshift consistently show higher [Mg/Fe] and lower [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], regardless of their observed redshift. The evolution in [Fe/H] and [C/H] is therefore primarily driven by lower-redshift samples naturally including galaxies with longer star formation timescales. In contrast, the lower [Mg/H] likely reflects earlier-forming galaxies expelling larger gas reservoirs during their quenching phase. Consequently, the mass–metallicity relation, primarily reflecting [Mg/H], is somewhat lower at z = 1–3 compared to the lower-redshift relation. Finally, we compare our results to standard stellar population modeling approaches employing solar abundance patterns and nonparametric star formation histories (using Prospector). Our simple stellar population (SSP)-equivalent ages agree with the mass-weighted ages from Prospector, while the metallicities disagree significantly. Nonetheless, the metallicities better reflect [Fe/H] than total [Z/H]. We also find that the star formation timescales inferred from elemental abundances are significantly shorter than those from Prospector, and we discuss the resulting implications for the early formation of massive galaxies.

Quasars are powered by supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion disks, yet standard thin disk models are inconsistent with many observations. Recently, P. F. Hopkins et al. simulated the formation of a quasar disk feeding an SMBH of mass M = 1.3 × 107M⊙ in a galaxy. The disk had surprisingly strong toroidal magnetic fields that supported it vertically from gravity and powered rapid accretion. What feedback can such a system produce? To answer this, we must follow the gas to the event horizon. For this, we interpolated the quasar into the general-relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics code H-AMR and performed 3D simulations with BH spins a = 0 and a = 0.9375. This remapping generates magnetic monopoles, which we erase using a novel divergence cleaning approach. Despite the toroidal magnetic field's dominance at large radii, vertical magnetic flux builds up near the event horizon, leading to a magnetic state transition within the inner 200 gravitational radii of the disk. This powers strong winds and, for spinning BHs, relativistic jets that can spin down the BH within 5−10 Myr. Sometimes, vertical magnetic fields of opposite polarity reach the BH, causing a polarity inversion event that briefly destroys the jets and, possibly, the X-ray corona. These strong fields power accretion at rates 5× the Eddington limit, which can double the BH mass in 5–10 Myr. When a = 0.9375 (a = 0), the energy in mechanical outflows and radiation equals about 60% (10%) and 100% (3%) of the accreted rest mass energy, respectively. Much of the light escapes in cool, ≳1300 au photospheres, consistent with quasar microlensing and spectral energy distributions.

<title>Spectroscopic Confirmation of a Massive Protocluster with Two Substructures at z ≃ 3.1</title>

We present the results of a Keck and Northern Extended Millimeter Array spectroscopic survey of 507 galaxies, where we confirm the presence of two massive overdensities at z = 3.090−3.110 and z = 3.133−3.155 in the neighborhood of the GOODS-N, each with over a dozen spectroscopically confirmed members. We find that both of these have galaxy overdensities of near-infrared-detected galaxies of δgal,obs = 6−9 within corrected volumes of (6−7) × 103 cMpc3. We estimate the properties of the z = 0 descendants of these overdensities using a spherical collapse model and find that both should virialize by z ≃ 0.5−0.8, with total masses of Mtot ≃ (6−7) × 1014M⊙. The same spherical collapse calculations, as well as a clustering-of-clusters statistical analysis, suggest a >80% likelihood that the two overdensities will collapse into a single cluster with Mtot = (1.0−1.5) × 1015M⊙ by z ~ 0.1−0.4. The z = 3.14 substructure contains a core of four bright dusty star-forming galaxies with ΣSFR = 2700 ± 700M⊙ yr−1 in a volume of only 280 cMpc3.

<title>Tearing-mediated Alfvénic Turbulence in a Relativistic Plasma</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada28a</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada28a</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In astrophysical relativistic plasmas, Alfvénic turbulence exists across a wide range of scales. Similar to a nonrelativistic case, this turbulence can be influenced by the tearing instability. We argue that in an ultrarelativistic pair plasma the tearing effects become significant at the critical scale given by , where L⊥ represents the outer scale of the turbulence and drel the relativistic electron inertial scale. Here n = 1 corresponds to the Harris magnetic configurations, while n = 2 applies to localized (non-Harris) magnetic profiles of turbulence-generated current sheets. Below the critical scale, the energy spectrum of magnetic fluctuations steepens to W(k)dk ∝ k−(7n+2)/3ndk. However, this happens only when , where is the magnetization parameter based on the magnetic fluctuations. If the opposite inequality holds, the Alfvénic cascade is instead affected by charge starvation at scales below , and the energy spectrum becomes steeper than W(k)dk ∝ k−3dk. When drel is replaced by its nonrelativistic equivalent, our results agree with the nonrelativistic analysis of N. F. Loureiro & S. Boldyrev (2018). In the Harris case n = 1, they agree with the recent relativistic studies by I. Demidov & Y. Lyubarsky.

<title>Fast-rotating A- and F-type Stars with Hα Emissions in NGC 3532: Candidate UV-dim Stars?</title>

Extended main-sequence stars that are dim in the ultraviolet passbands of the Hubble Space Telescope (UV-dim stars) are found in several young and intermediate-age star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs). The obscuring of the dust in the disks of stars expelled as a result of fast rotation has been suggested to be responsible for the appearance of UV-dim stars and to play an important role in the formation of extended main sequences. In this paper, we report a population of A- and F-type stars that show Hα emission features in their spectra in the young (~340 Myr old) neighboring Galactic star cluster NGC 3532. By fitting the observed absorption profiles, we found that most Hα emitters are fast-rotating stars, indicating that they form decretion disks by fast rotation like Be stars. As A- and F-type stars dominate the extended main-sequence turnoff regions of intermediate-age clusters, their appearance provides observational evidence to support the dust extinction scenario for these clusters, and they might be the counterparts of UV-dim stars that are detected in remote MC star clusters such as NGC 1783.

<title>A Semi-analytical Model for Stellar Evolution in AGN Disks</title>

Disks of gas accreting onto supermassive black holes may host numerous stellar-mass objects, formed within the disk or captured from a nuclear star cluster. We present a simplified model of stellar evolution in these dense environments, which exhibits exceptional agreement with full stellar evolution calculations at a minuscule fraction of the cost. Although the model presented here is limited to stars burning hydrogen in their cores, it is sufficient to determine the evolutionary fate of disk-embedded stars: whether they proceed to later stages of nuclear burning and leave behind a compact remnant, reach a quasi-steady state where mass loss and accretion balance one another, or whether accretion proceeds faster than stellar structure can adjust, causing a runaway. We highlight how various disk parameters and phenomena such as gap opening affect stellar evolution outcomes. We also highlight how our model can accommodate time-varying conditions, such as those experienced by a star on an eccentric orbit, and can couple to N-body integrations. This model will enable more detailed studies of stellar populations and their interaction with accretion disks than have previously been possible.

<title>Vortex-induced Rings and Gaps within Protoplanetary Disks</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9f2c</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9f2c</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Observations of protoplanetary disks have revealed the presence of both crescent-shaped and ring-like structures in dust continuum emission. These crescents are thought to arise from dust-trapping vortices generated by the Rossby wave instability, which induces density waves akin to those caused by planets. These vortices have the potential to create gaps and rings within the disk, resulting from the dissipation of their density waves. We carry out 2D hydrodynamic simulations in the shearing box to investigate vortex–disk interaction. We find that long-lived vortices can produce dust rings and gaps in inviscid discs detectable by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, and a more elongated vortex produces rings at larger separations. Vortex-induced density waves carry over 2 orders of magnitude higher angular momentum flux compared to planet-induced ones that shock at the same location, making the former much more effective at producing dust gaps and rings far away.

<title>Detection of Enhanced Germanium in a New Cool Extreme Helium Star A980: Insights and Implications</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada1c2</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada1c2</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A fine abundance analysis of a recently discovered hydrogen-deficient carbon (HdC) star, A980, is presented. Based on the observed high-resolution optical spectrum, we ascertain that A980 is a cool extreme helium (EHe) star and not an HdC star. Singly ionized germanium Ge ii lines are identified in A980’s optical spectrum. These are the first-ever detections of germanium lines in an EHe star's observed spectrum and provide the first measurements of germanium abundance in an EHe star. The overabundance of germanium in A980’s atmosphere provides us with evidence for the synthesis of germanium in EHe stars. Among the known cool EHe stars, A980 exhibits a maximum enhancement of the s-process elements based on a significant number of transitions. The measured elemental abundances reveal signs of H-burning, He-burning, and specifically the nucleosyntheses of the key elements Ge, Sr, Y, Zr, and Ba. The nucleosyntheses of these key elements are discussed in light of asymptotic giant branch evolution and the expectation from the accretion of an He white dwarf by a C–O white dwarf or by a neutron star.

<title>Reverberation Evidence for Stream Collision and Delayed Disk Formation in Tidal Disruption Events</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada274</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada274</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
When a star passes through the tidal disruption radius of a massive black hole (BH), it can be torn apart by the tidal force of the BH, known as the tidal disruption event (TDE). Since the observed UV/optical luminosity significantly exceeds the predictions of the compact disk model in classical TDE theory, two competing models, stream collision and envelope reprocessing, have been proposed to address this discrepancy. To distinguish between these models, we investigated the continuum reverberation behaviors for ~30 TDEs with high-quality multiband light curves. We found that over half of them exhibit a positive lag by a few days in UV/optical bands, indicating that their inferred sizes are significantly larger than the envelope sizes in reprocessing. Moreover, X-ray emissions are not only significantly delayed relative to the primary UV/optical peak but also lag behind the rebrightening bump by up to several tens of days, completely different from the X-ray illumination reprocessing. Additionally, the anticorrelated UV−optical continuum in ASASSN-15lh further disfavors the reprocessing scenario. In contrast, the model of stream collisions, combined with delayed accretion disk formation, can provide a unified explanation for the diverse TDE observations, e.g., the optical/X-ray population and the frequently observed rebrightening bump. This model describes a unification scheme wherein the UV/optical emission originates from stream collisions during the early stage of TDE evolution and gradually transitions to being dominated by a accretion disk with detectable X-ray emission in the late stage. After transitioning to a quiescent state, recurrent flares may be observed in some cases, possibly related to repeating partial TDEs.

<title>Secular Perturbations from Exterior Giants Strongly Influence Gap Complexity in Peas-in-a-pod Exoplanetary Systems</title>

It has been demonstrated that systems of tightly packed inner planets with giant exterior companions tend to have less regular orbital spacings than those without such companions. We investigate whether this observed increase in the gap complexity of the inner systems can be explained solely as the result of secular dynamics caused by the disturbing potential of the exterior companions. Amplification of mutual orbital inclinations in the inner system due to such secular dynamics may lead to the inner system attaining nonmutually transiting geometries, thereby creating artificial observed gaps that result in a higher calculated gap complexity. Using second-order secular theory, we compute time-averaged observed gap complexities along a favorable line of sight for a set of hypothetical systems, both with and without an outer giant. We find that these secular interactions can significantly contribute to the observed gap complexity dichotomy in tightly packed multiple-planet systems.

<title>Unraveling the Dusty Environment around RT Vir</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Infrared (IR) studies of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are critical to our understanding of the formation of cosmic dust. In this investigation, we explore the mid- to far-IR emission of the oxygen-rich AGB star RT Virginis. This optically thin dusty environment has unusual spectral features when compared to other stars in its class. To explore this enigmatic object we use the one-dimensional radiative transfer modeling code DUSTY. Modeled spectra are compared with observations from the Infrared Space Observatory, InfraRed Astronomical Satellite, the Herschel Space Observatory, and a host of other sources to determine the properties of RT Vir's circumstellar material. Our models suggest a set of two distant and cool dust shells at low optical depths (τV,inner = 0.16, τV,outer = 0.06), with inner dust temperatures T1 = 330 K, T3 = 94 K. Overall, these dust shells exhibit a chemical composition consistent with dust typically found around O-rich AGB stars. However, the distribution of materials differs significantly. The inner shell consists of a mixture of silicates, Al2O3, FeO, and Fe, while the outer shell primarily contains crystalline Al2O3 polymorphs. This chemical change is indicative of two distinct epochs of dust formation around RT Vir. These changes in dust composition are driven by either changes in the pressure–temperature conditions around the star or by a decrease in the C/O ratio due to hot-bottom burning.

<title>A Dichotomy in the 1–24 GHz Parsec-scale Radio Spectra of Radio-quiet Quasars</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada142</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada142</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the parsec-scale radio spectra of a representative sample of 13 Palomar–Green radio-quiet quasars, based on our new Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations at 8.4 and 23.6 GHz and our earlier VLBA studies at 1.5 and 5.0 GHz. The radio core emission generally exhibits a flat spectrum at 1.5–5.0 GHz, which indicates a compact optically thick synchrotron source on a scale smaller than the broad-line region (BLR) radius RBLR ∼ 0.01–0.1 pc. The 8.4–23.6 GHz spectral slope remains flat in four objects indicating the inner radius of the radio source Rin < 0.1RBLR, and becomes steep in four other objects indicating Rin ∼ 0.5 RBLR. The flat 8.4–23.6 GHz slope sources may be associated with a continuous ejection starting at the accretion disk corona. The steep 8.4–23.6 GHz slope sources may be produced by an interaction of an active-galactic-nucleus-driven wind with the BLR gas or a low-power jet extending to the BLR scale. Seven of these eight objects, which have a flat or steep 8.4–23.6 GHz slope, reside at the Eddington ratios L/LEdd < 0.3, and four of the remaining five objects, where the 8.4–23.6 GHz fluxes are too faint to significantly constrain the slope, reside at L/LEdd > 0.3. The 8.4–23.6 GHz radio emission in the high-L/LEdd objects may be weak due to more extended emission from a radiation-pressure-driven wind. Future submillimeter observations can further constrain the inward radial extent of the radio emission down to the coronal scale.

<title>HCG 57: Evidence for Shock-heated Intergalactic Gas from X-Rays and Optical Emission Line Spectroscopy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observations of the compact group HCG 57, and optical integral field spectroscopy of the interacting galaxy pair HCG 57A/D. These two spiral galaxies recently suffered an off-axis collision with HCG 57D passing through the disk of A. We find evidence of a gas bridge linking the galaxies, containing ∼108M⊙ of hot, ∼1 keV thermal plasma and warm ionized gas radiating in Hα, Hβ, [O iii] and [N ii] lines. The optical emission lines in the central regions of HCG 57D show excitation properties consistent with H ii-regions, while the outer rim of HCG 57D parts of the bridge and the outer regions of HCG 57A show evidence of shocked gas consistent with shock velocities of 200–300 km s−1. In contrast, the X-ray emitting gas requires a collision velocity of 650–750 km s−1 to explain the observed temperatures. These different shock velocities can be reconciled by considering the contributions of rotation to collision velocity in different parts of the disks, and the clumpy nature of the preshock medium in the galaxies, which likely lead to different shock velocities in different components of the turbulent postshocked gas. We examine the diffuse X-ray emission in the group members and their associated point sources, identifying X-ray active galactic nuclei in HCG 57A, B, and D. We also confirm the previously reported ∼1 keV intra-group medium and find it to be relaxed with a low central entropy (18.0 ± 1.7 keV cm2 within 20 kpc) but a long cooling time (5.9 ± 0.8 Gyr).

<title>Exploring the Evolution of a Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy with SPH Simulations. II. AGN Feedback</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback from an intermediate-mass black hole at the center of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy, by performing isolated galaxy simulations using a modified version of the GADGET-3 code. We consider Leo II (PGC 34176) in the Local Group as our simulation reference model. Beginning with black hole seeds ranging from 103−106M⊙, our simulations focus on comparing stellar/SN-only feedback with AGN+stellar/SN feedback over 13.7 Gyr of galactic evolution. Our results indicate that a low-mass AGN in a dwarf galaxy influences the star formation history under specific physical conditions. While AGN feedback is generally negative on star formation, instances of positive feedback were also identified. Despite measurable effects on the evolution of the dwarf host galaxy, black hole seeds exhibited only marginal growth. We tested several physical scenarios as modified models in our simulations, primarily concerning the dynamics of the central black holes, which may wander within dwarf galaxies rather than being centrally located. However, none of these adjustments significantly impacted the growth of the black hole seeds. This suggests that intermediate-mass black holes may struggle to achieve higher masses in isolated environments, with mergers and interactions likely playing crucial roles in their growth. Nevertheless, AGN feedback exhibited nonnegligible effects in our simulated dwarf spheroidal galaxies, despite the assumed dominant role of stellar feedback in the low-mass regime.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Dynamical interactions in dense star clusters could significantly influence the properties of black holes, leaving imprints on their gravitational-wave signatures. While previous studies have mostly focused on repeated black hole mergers for spin and mass growth, this work examines the impact of physical collisions and close encounters between black holes and (noncompact) stars. Using Monte Carlo N-body models of dense star clusters, we find that a large fraction of black holes retained upon formation undergo collisions with stars. Within our explored cluster models, the proportion of binary black hole mergers affected by stellar collisions ranges from 10%–60%. If all stellar-mass black holes are initially nonspinning, we find that up to 40% of merging binary black holes may have components with dimensionless spin parameter χ ≳ 0.2 because of prior stellar collisions, while typically about 10% have spins near χ = 0.7 from prior black hole mergers. We demonstrate that young star clusters are especially important environments, as they can produce collisions of black holes with very massive stars, allowing for significant spin-up of the black holes through accretion. Our predictions for black hole spin distributions from these stellar collisions highlight their sensitivity to accretion efficiency, underscoring the need for detailed hydrodynamic calculations to better understand the accretion physics following these interactions.

<title>The Coronal Power Spectrum from MHD Mode Conversion above Sunspots</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Sunspots are intense regions of magnetic flux that are rooted deep below the photosphere. It is well established that sunspots host magnetohydrodynamic waves, with numerous observations showing a connection to the internal acoustic (or p-)modes of the Sun. The p-modes are fast waves below the equipartition layer and are thought to undergo a double mode conversion as they propagate upward into the atmosphere of sunspots, which can generate Alfvénic modes in the upper atmosphere. We employ 2.5D magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations to investigate the adiabatic wave propagation and examine the resulting power spectra of coronal Alfvénic waves. A broadband wave source is used, which has a 1D power spectrum mimicking aspects of the observed p-mode power spectrum. We examine magnetoacoustic wave propagation and mode conversion from the photosphere to the corona. Frequency filtering of the upwardly propagating acoustic waves is a natural consequence of a gravitationally stratified atmosphere and plays a key role in shaping the power spectra of mode-converted waves. We demonstrate that the slow and fast magnetoacoustic waves and Alfvén waves above the equipartition layer have similarly shaped power spectra, which are modified versions of the driver spectrum. Notably, the results reveal that the coronal wave power spectra have a peak at a higher frequency than that of the underlying p-mode driver. This matches observations of coronal Alfvénic waves and further supports the role of the mode conversion process as a mechanism for Alfvénic wave generation in the Sun's atmosphere.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent high-angular-resolution observations indicate the need for core growth to form high-mass stars. To understand the gas dynamics at the core scale in the very early evolutionary stages before being severely affected by feedback, we have conducted Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations toward a 70 μm dark massive clump, G337.541-00.082 as part of the Global and Local infall in the ASHES sample (GLASHES) program. Using dense gas tracers such as N2H+ (J = 1–0) and HNC (J = 3–2), we find signs of infall from the position–velocity diagram and more directly from the blue asymmetry profile in addition to the clump-scale velocity gradient. We estimate infall velocities from intermediate and low-mass cores to be 0.28–1.45 km s−1, and infall rates to be on the order of 10−4–10−3M⊙ yr−1, both are higher than those measured in low-mass star-forming regions by more than a factor of 5 and an order of magnitude, respectively. We find a strong correlation between the infall velocity with the nonthermal velocity dispersion, suggesting that infall may contribute significantly to the observed line width. Consistent with clump-fed scenarios, we show that the mass infall rate is larger for larger core masses and shorter distances to the clump center. Such high infall rates in cores embedded in IRDCs can be considered as strong signs of core growth, allowing high-mass star formation from intermediate-mass cores that would not initially form high-mass stars at their current mass.

Understanding which processes control atmospheric escape and the loss of water from planetary environments is crucial. The ESA’s Venus Express spacecraft has observed a significant depletion in Venus’s upper atmosphere, driven by the solar wind. In such scenarios, the electromagnetic force can accelerate planetary ions to energies that allow them to escape from the planet. However, it is extremely challenging to directly measure electromagnetic forces on planetary ions. Here we present a 3D multifluid Hall–magnetohydrodynamics simulation model to investigate electromagnetic force terms and the effects of each term on solar wind plasma and planetary ions. We find that the total electromagnetic force reaches its peak near the bow shock and the magnetic pileup boundary, with obvious asymmetric characteristics, which slows down the solar wind plasma and compresses the heavy ions toward Venus. In addition, the morphology of the convection electric field force shows obvious north–south asymmetry, which leads to the formation of asymmetric structures and plasma flows in the Venusian magnetotail. The electromagnetic force patterns obtained by simulation are consistent with the results and speculation from observations, suggesting that the multifluid model developed here has substantial capacity in further analysis regarding planetary ion escape.

The flat spectrum radio quasar PKS 1510−089 is one of the most active blazars across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, displaying periods of flaring activity. This study explores its spectral variability over a decade. By employing the nonthermal dominance parameter, we analyze the Hβ and λ5100 continuum light curves, as well as the FWHM of the Hβ emission line, to identify whether the primary source of the continuum emission is the accretion disk or the jet during activity periods. Our results show an anticorrelation between the FWHM and the luminosity of the Hβ emission line across all data sets. This indicates that variations in Hβ luminosity consistently reflect the canonical broad-line region (BLR), irrespective of whether the primary ionizing source is the accretion disk or the jet. The anticorrelation persisted when comparing the FWHM of Hβ against the luminosity at λ5100 in the disk dominance regime. These findings, along with the observation that flaring events in the λ5100 continuum, attributed to the jet, coincide with flares in the Hβ emission line, suggest that the base of the jet is located within the BLR. Based on the 219 spectra within the disk dominance regime, we estimated a mean black hole mass of MBH = 2.85 ± 0.37 × 108M⊙.

<title>Quasi-parallel Antisunward-propagating Whistler Waves Associated with the Electron Deficit in the Near-Sun Solar Wind: Particle-in-cell Simulation</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada3d7</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In situ observations of the solar wind have shown that the electron velocity distribution function (VDF) consists of a quasi-Maxwellian core, comprising most of the electron population, and two sparser components: the halo, which are suprathermal and quasi-isotropic electrons, and an escaping beam population, the strahl. Recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SO) observations have added one more ingredient to the known nonthermal features, the deficit—a depletion in the sunward region of the VDF, already predicted by exospheric models but never so extensively observed. By employing particle-in-cell simulations, we study electron VDFs that reproduce those typically observed in the inner heliosphere and investigate whether the electron deficit may contribute to the onset of kinetic instabilities. Previous studies and in situ observations show that strahl electrons drive oblique whistler waves unstable, which in turn scatters them. As a result, suprathermal electrons can occupy regions of phase space where they fulfill resonance conditions with the parallel-propagating whistler wave. The suprathermal electrons lose kinetic energy, resulting in the generation of unstable waves. The sunward side of the VDF, initially depleted of electrons, is gradually filled, as this wave−particle interaction process, triggered by the depletion itself, takes place. Our findings are compared and validated against current PSP and SO observations: among others, our study provides a mechanism explaining the presence in the heliosphere of regularly observed parallel antisunward whistler waves, suggests why these waves are frequently observed concomitant with distributions presenting an electron deficit, and describes a noncollisional heat flux regulating process.

<title>Precise Measurement of the Cosmic-Ray Spectrum and 〈ln A〉 by LHAASO: Connecting the Galactic to the Extragalactic Components</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recently, the LHAASO Collaboration has provided precise measurements of the cosmic rays (CRs) all-particle energy spectrum and mean logarithmic mass from 0.3 to 30 PeV. Combining the CR measurements by AMS-02 and DAMPE in space and those by LHAASO and Auger on the ground, we construct a model to recover all these measurements from tens of GeV to tens of EeV. We find that the LHAASO measurement is crucial in the model construction by connecting the Galactic component to the extragalactic component. The precise measurements of CR spectra for individual species by AMS-02 and DAMPE together with the newest LHAASO results clearly indicate three Galactic CR components, that is, a soft low-energy background, a hard high-energy component, and a local source contribution. However, the LHAASO data show that above ∼1016 eV, a nonnegligible extra component, possibly of extragalactic origin, must be included. Combining the Auger results and the LHAASO results, we figure out the extragalactic CRs that need at least two components at lower and higher energies. Thanks to the measurements by LHAASO, the constraints on the model parameters are quite stringent. The spectrum features and mass measurements in all energy ranges are all well reproduced in the model.

<title>Analytical Verification of the Normal Vector Determination Methods for Planar Magnetic Structures</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Minimum variance analysis of magnetic fields (MVAB) is conventionally implemented to determine the normal vector of a planar magnetic structure (PMS) for which the average of the normal magnetic field component vanishes (i.e., = 0). A more suitable normal vector determination method for single-spacecraft measurements, based on the minimum variance concept, is recommended for PMS studies, namely the MVAB method associated with the constraint = 0 (MVABC). An analytical PMS model is employed to verify the performance of the MVAB and MVABC methods for three different types of PMSs, under the circumstances that the values are highly fluctuated but the remains zero. The results show that MVABC outperforms MVAB in estimating the PMS normal vector. By analyzing a large number of test data sets randomly selected from the original data set, the conclusion remains unchanged. The normal of a PMS discontinuity, which is associated with significant fluctuations, is accurately predicted by MVABC and the cross-product method, as compared to MVAB. Moreover, the normal of the discontinuity aligns with the PMS normal, as expected. Two PMS events observed by the Advanced Composition Explorer spacecraft in the sheath of an interplanetary coronal mass ejection are presented. From the MVAB perspective, these two events are not classified as PMSs. The estimated normals of the in situ PMS discontinuities from the cross-product method form angles between 10° and 20° with the predicted PMS normals from MVABC. Discussions are given regarding the failure of the MVAB method in PMS identification.

<title>Merger Response of Halo Anisotropy Properties</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Anisotropy properties—halo spin, shape, position offset, velocity offset, and orientation—are an important family of dark matter halo properties that indicate the level of directional variation of the internal structures of halos. These properties reflect the dynamical state of halos, which in turn depends on the mass assembly history. In this work, we study the evolution of anisotropy properties in response to merger activity using the IllustrisTNG simulations. We find that the response trajectories of the anisotropy properties significantly deviate from secular evolution. These trajectories have the same qualitative features and timescales across a wide range of merger and host properties. We propose explanations for the behavior of these properties and connect their evolution to the relevant stages of merger dynamics. We measure the relevant dynamical timescales. We also explore the dependence of the strength of the response on time of merger, merger ratio, and mass of the main halo. These results provide insight into the physics of halo mergers and their effects on the statistical behavior of halo properties. This study paves the way toward a physical understanding of scaling relations, particularly to how systematics in their scatter are connected to the mass assembly histories of halos.

<title>PUI Heating in the Supersonic Solar Wind</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada891</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada891</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The outer heliosphere is profoundly influenced by nonthermal energetic pickup ions (PUIs), which dominate the internal pressure of the solar wind beyond ~10 au, surpassing both solar wind and magnetic pressures. PUIs are formed mostly through charge exchange between interstellar neutral atoms and solar wind ions. This study examines the apparent heating of PUIs in the distant supersonic solar wind before reaching the heliospheric termination shock. New Horizons’ SWAP observations reveal an unexpected PUI temperature change between 2015 and 2020, with a notable bump in PUI temperature. Concurrent observations from the ACE and Wind spacecraft at 1 au indicate a ~50% increase in solar wind dynamic pressure at the end of 2014. Our simulation suggests that the bump observed in the PUI temperature by New Horizons is largely associated with the enhanced solar wind dynamic pressure observed at 1 au. Additional PUI temperature enhancements imply the involvement of other heating mechanisms. Analysis of New Horizons data reveals a correlation between shocks and PUI heating during the declining phase of the solar cycle. Using a PUI-mediated plasma model, we explore shock structures and PUI heating, finding that shocks preferentially heat PUIs over the thermal solar wind in the outer heliosphere. We also show that the broad shock thickness observed by New Horizons is due to the large diffusion coefficient associated with PUIs. Shocks and compression regions in the distant supersonic solar wind lead to elevated PUI temperatures and thus they can increase the production of energetic neutral atoms with large energy.

<title>Enhancing Mars Gravity Field Solutions with China’s Tianwen-1 Tracking Data</title>

The Tianwen-1 (TW1) mission, which successfully entered Mars's orbit in 2021, provides a valuable data set for enhancing the understanding of Mars’s gravity field. The highly elliptical near-polar orbit of the TW1 orbiter offers unique sensitivity to long-wavelength gravity signals, complementing the contributions of low-altitude missions like the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). In this study, we used 4 months of TW1 radio tracking data in combination with MRO data to develop a new Mars gravity field model up to degree and order 50. We evaluated the improvement of gravity field determination through power spectrum analysis, gravity anomaly maps, and trajectory precision assessment. The result shows significant improvements in accuracy up to degree and order 30, with an average enhancement of 38% in the zonal harmonic coefficients. There are obvious differences between the two gravity field models in gravity anomaly maps. The range of gravity anomaly errors improves after incorporating TW1 data, with the maximum error decreasing from 53.4 to 46.4 mGal and the average error improving from 8.4 to 7.3 mGal. Additionally, orbit determination experiments confirm that the fused gravity field model enhances trajectory modeling for both MRO and TW1. These findings highlight the scientific value of TW1 tracking data in advancing Mars’s gravity field modeling and provide critical insights for future deep-space missions.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Understanding the nonlinear dynamics of coupled scalar fields often necessitates simulations on a 3D mesh. These simulations can be computationally expensive if a large scale separation is involved. A common solution is adaptive mesh refinement, which, however, greatly increases a simulation's complexity. In this work, we present sledgehamr, an AMReX-based code package to make the simulation of coupled scalar fields on an adaptive mesh more accessible. Compatible with both GPU and CPU clusters, sledgehamr offers a flexible and customizable framework. While the code had been primarily developed to evolve axion string networks, this framework enables various other applications, such as the study of gravitational waves sourced by the dynamics of scalar fields.

<title>Not Just Winds: Why Models Find That Binary Black Hole Formation Is Metallicity-dependent, while Binary Neutron Star Formation Is Not</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada14a</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada14a</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Both detailed and rapid population studies alike predict that binary black hole (BHBH) formation is orders of magnitude more efficient at low metallicity than high metallicity, while binary neutron star (NSNS) formation remains mostly flat with metallicity, and black hole–neutron star mergers show intermediate behavior. This finding is a key input to employ double compact objects as tracers of low-metallicity star formation, as spectral sirens, and for merger rate calculations. Yet the literature offers various (sometimes contradicting) explanations for these trends. We investigate the dominant cause for the metallicity dependence of double compact object formation. We find that the BHBH formation efficiency at low metallicity is set by initial condition distributions, and conventional simulations suggest that about one in eight interacting binary systems with sufficient mass to form black holes will lead to a merging BHBH. We further find that the significance of metallicities in double compact object formation is a question of formation channel. The stable mass transfer and chemically homogeneous evolution channels mainly diminish at high metallicities due to changes in stellar radii, while the common envelope channel is primarily impacted by the combined effects of stellar winds and mass-scaled natal kicks. Outdated giant wind prescriptions exacerbate the latter effect, suggesting that BHBH formation may be much less metallicity-dependent than previously assumed. NSNS formation efficiency remains metallicity-independent, as they form exclusively through the common envelope channel, with natal kicks that are assumed to be uncorrelated with mass. Forthcoming gravitational-wave observations will provide valuable constraints on these findings.

<title>Constraining Solar Wind Transport Model Parameters Using Bayesian Analysis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We apply nested-sampling Bayesian analysis to a model for the transport of magnetohydrodynamic-scale solar wind fluctuations. The dual objectives are to obtain improved constraints on parameters present in the turbulence transport model (TTM) and to support quantitative comparisons of the quality of distinct versions of the transport model. The TTMs analyzed are essentially the 1D steady-state ones presented in Breech et al. that describe the radial evolution of the energy, correlation length, and normalized cross helicity of the fluctuations, together with the proton temperature, in prescribed background solar wind fields. Modeled effects present in the TTM include nonlinear turbulence interactions, shear driving, and energy injection associated with pickup-ions. Each of these modeled effects involves adjustable parameters that we seek to constrain using Bayesian analysis. We find that, given the TTMs and observational data sets analyzed, the most appropriate TTM to recommend corresponds to 2D fluctuations and has von Kármán–Howarth parameters of α ≈ 0.16 and β ≈ 0.10, along with reasonably standard values for the other adjustable parameters. The analysis also indicates that it is advantageous to include pickup ion effects in the lengthscale evolution equation by assuming Z2β/αλ is locally conserved. Such Bayesian analysis is readily extended to more sophisticated solar wind models, space weather models, and might lead to improved predictions of, for example, solar flare and coronal mass ejection interactions with the Earth.

<title>Planet–Planet Scattering and Von Zeipel–Lidov–Kozai Migration—The Dynamical History of HAT-P-11</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The two planets of the HAT-P-11 system represent fascinating dynamical puzzles due to their significant eccentricities and orbital misalignments. In particular, HAT-P-11 b is in a close-in orbit in which tides should have circularized well within the age of the system. Here we propose a two-step dynamical process that can reproduce all intriguing aspects of the system. We first invoke planet–planet scattering to generate significant eccentricities and mutual inclinations between the planets. We then propose that this misalignment initiated von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycles and high-eccentricity migration that ultimately brought HAT-P-11 b to its present-day orbit. We find that this scenario is fully consistent only when significant tidally driven radius inflation is accounted for during the tidal migration. We present a suite of N-body simulations exploring each phase of evolution and show that this scenario is consistent with all observational posteriors and the reported age of the system.

<title>3D Convective Urca Process in a Simmering White Dwarf</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A proposed setting for thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae is a white dwarf that has gained mass from a companion to the point of carbon ignition in the core. In the early stages of carbon burning, called the simmering phase, energy released by the reactions in the core drive the formation and growth of a core convection zone. One aspect of this phase is the convective Urca process, a linking of weak nuclear reactions to convection, which may alter the composition and structure of the white dwarf. The convective Urca process is not well understood and requires 3D fluid simulations to properly model the turbulent convection, an inherently 3D process. Because the neutron excess of the fluid both sets and is set by the extent of the convection zone, the realistic steady state can only be determined in simulations with real 3D mixing processes. Additionally, the convection is relatively slow (Mach number less than 0.005) and thus a low Mach number method is needed to model the flow over many convective turnovers. Using the MAESTROeX low Mach number hydrodynamic software, we present the first full-star 3D simulations of the A = 23 convective Urca process, spanning hundreds of convective turnover times. Our findings on the extent of mixing across the Urca shell, the characteristic velocities of the flow, the energy-loss rates due to neutrino emission, and the structure of the convective boundary can be used to inform 1D stellar models that track the longer-timescale evolution.

<title>Extreme Scale Height Variations and Nozzle Shocks in Warped Disks</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9a85</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Accretion disks around both stellar-mass and supermassive black holes (BHs) are likely often warped. Whenever a disk is warped, its scale height varies with azimuth. Sufficiently strong warps cause extreme compressions of the scale height, which fluid parcels “bounce” off of twice per orbit to high latitudes. We study the dynamics of strong warps using (i) the nearly analytic “ring theory” of Fairbairn & Ogilvie, which we generalize to the Kerr metric, and (ii) three-dimensional general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of tori (“rings”) around BHs, using the H-AMR code. We initialize a ring with a warp and study its evolution on tens of orbital periods. The simulations agree excellently with the ring theory until the warp amplitude, ψ, reaches a critical value ψc. When ψ > ψc, the rings enter the bouncing regime. We analytically derive (and numerically validate) that in the non-Keplerian regime, where rg = GM/c2 is the gravitational radius, and M is the mass of the central object. Whenever the scale height bounces, the vertical velocity becomes supersonic, leading to “nozzle shocks” as gas collides at the scale height minima. Nozzle shocks damp the warp within ≈10–20 orbits, which is not captured by the ring theory. Nozzle shock dissipation leads to inflow timescales 1–2 orders of magnitude shorter than unwarped α disks, which may result in rapid variability, such as in changing-look active galactic nuclei or in the soft state of X-ray binaries. We propose that steady disks with strong warps may self-regulate to have amplitudes near ψc.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Our knowledge of relations between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies at z ≳ 1 is still limited, even though being actively sought out to z ∼ 6. Here, we use the high resolution and sensitivity of JWST to measure the host galaxy properties for 107 X-ray-selected type-I active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at 0.68 < z < 2.5 with rest-frame optical/near-infrared imaging from COSMOS-Web and PRIMER. Black hole masses ( ) are available from previous spectroscopic campaigns. We extract the host galaxy components from four NIRCam broadband images and the Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys F814W image by applying a 2D image decomposition technique. We detect the host galaxy for ∼90% of the sample after subtracting the unresolved AGN emission. With host photometry free of AGN emission, we determine the stellar mass of the host galaxies to be through spectral energy distribution fitting and measure the evolution of the mass relation between SMBHs and their host galaxies. Considering selection biases and measurement uncertainties, we find that the MBH/M*ratio evolves as thus remains essentially constant or exhibits mild evolution up to z ∼ 2.5. We also see an amount of scatter ( ), similar to the local relation and consistent with low-z studies, and a noncausal cosmic assembly history where mergers contribute to the statistical averaging toward the local relation is still feasible. We highlight improvements to come with larger samples from JWST and, particularly, Euclid, which will exceed the statistical power of current wide and deep surveys.

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission identified a potential 0.88R⊕ planet with a period of 7.577 days, orbiting the nearby M1V star GJ 341 (TOI 741.01). This system has already been observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to search for presence of an atmosphere on this planet. Here, we present an in-depth analysis of the GJ 341 system using all available public data. We provide improved parameters for the host star, an updated value of the planet radius, and support the planetary nature of the object (now GJ 341 b). We use 57 HARPS radial velocities to model the magnetic cycle and activity of the host star, and constrain the mass of GJ 341 b to upper limits of 4.0 M⊕ (3σ) and 2.9 M⊕ (1σ). We also rule out the presence of additional companions with M sin i > 15.1 M⊕, and P < 1750 days, and the presence of contaminating background objects during the TESS and JWST observations. These results provide key information to aid the interpretation of the recent JWST atmospheric observations and other future observations of this planet.

<title>Identifying Galactic Substructures in 5D Space Using All-sky RR Lyrae Stars in Gaia DR3</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Motivated by the vast gap between photometric and spectroscopic data volumes, there is great potential in using 5D kinematic information to identify and study substructures of the Milky Way. We identify substructures in the Galactic halo using 46,575 RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) from Gaia Data Release 3, with photometric metallicities and distances newly estimated by X.-Y. Li et al. Assuming a Gaussian prior distribution of radial velocity, we calculate the orbital distribution characterized by the integrals of motion for each RRL, based on its 3D positions, proper motions, and corresponding errors, and then apply the friends-of-friends algorithm to identify groups moving along similar orbits. We have identified several known substructures, including the Sagittarius stream, the Hercules-Aquila Cloud (HAC), the Virgo Overdensity (VOD), Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES), the Orphan-Chenab stream, Cetus-Palca, the Helmi streams, Sequoia, Wukong, and the Large Magellanic Cloud leading arm, as well as 18 unknown groups. Our findings indicate that the HAC and VOD have kinematic and chemical properties remarkably similar to GES, with most HAC and VOD members exhibiting eccentricity as high as GES, suggesting that they may share a common origin with GES. The ability to identify low-mass and spatially dispersed substructures further demonstrates the potential of our method, which breaks the limit of spectroscopic surveys and is competent for probing substructures throughout the whole Galaxy. Finally, we also identify 18 unknown groups with good spatial clustering and proper-motion consistency, suggesting the possibility of further excavation of Milky Way substructures in the future with only 5D data.

<title>Causal Discovery in Astrophysics: Unraveling Supermassive Black Hole and Galaxy Coevolution</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Correlation does not imply causation, but patterns of statistical association between variables can be exploited to infer a causal structure (even with purely observational data) with the burgeoning field of causal discovery. As a purely observational science, astrophysics has much to gain by exploiting these new methods. The supermassive black hole (SMBH)–galaxy interaction has long been constrained by observed scaling relations, which is low-scatter correlations between variables such as SMBH mass and the central velocity dispersion of stars in a host galaxy's bulge. This study, using advanced causal discovery techniques and an up-to-date data set, reveals a causal link between galaxy properties and dynamically measured SMBH masses. We apply a score-based Bayesian framework to compute the exact conditional probabilities of every causal structure that could possibly describe our galaxy sample. With the exact posterior distribution, we determine the most likely causal structures and notice a probable causal reversal when separating galaxies by morphology. In elliptical galaxies, bulge properties (built from major mergers) tend to influence SMBH growth, while, in spiral galaxies, SMBHs are seen to affect host galaxy properties, potentially through feedback in gas-rich environments. For spiral galaxies, SMBHs progressively quench star formation, whereas, in elliptical galaxies, quenching is complete, and the causal connection has reversed. Our findings support theoretical models of hierarchical assembly of galaxies and active galactic nuclei feedback regulating galaxy evolution. Our study suggests the potentiality for further exploration of causal links in astrophysical and cosmological scaling relations, as well as any other observational science.

Using nearly simultaneous radio, near-infrared, optical, and ultraviolet (UV) data collected since 2009, we constructed 106 spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the blazar OJ 287. These SEDs are well fitted by a log-parabolic model. By classifying the data into “flare” and “quiescent” segments, we find that the median flux at the peak frequency of the SEDs during the flare segments is 0.37 ± 0.22 dex higher compared to the quiescent segments, while no significant differences are observed in the median values of the curvature parameter b or the peak frequency . A significant bluer-when-brighter trend is confirmed through the relation between the V magnitude and B − V color index, with this trend being stronger in the flare segments. Additionally, a significant anticorrelation is detected between and b, with a slope of 5.79 in the relation between 1/b and , closer to the prediction from a statistical acceleration model than a stochastic acceleration interpretation, though a notable discrepancy persists. This discrepancy indicates that additional factors—such as deviations from idealized conditions or radiative contributions, such as the thermal emission from the accretion disk in the optical–UV range during quiescent states—may play a role in producing the observed steeper slope. Within the framework of the statistical acceleration mechanism, the lack of correlation between the change in the peak intensity and the change in the peak frequency suggests that the change in the electron energy distribution is unlikely to be responsible for the time-dependent SED changes. Instead, changes in Doppler boosting or magnetic fields may have a greater influence.

<title>A New Approach to Identifying Red Supergiant Stars in Metal-poor Galaxies: A Case Study of NGC 6822</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A complete sample of red supergiant (RSG) stars is important for studying their properties. Identifying RSGs in extragalactic fields first requires removing the Galactic foreground dwarfs. The color–color diagram (CCD) method, specifically using r − z/z − H and J − H/H − K, has proven successful in several studies. However, in metal-poor galaxies, faint RSGs will mix into the dwarf branch in the CCD and would be removed, leading to an incomplete RSG sample. This work attempts to improve the CCD method in combination with the Gaia astrometric measurement to remove foreground contamination in order to construct a complete RSG sample in metal-poor galaxies. The empirical regions of RSGs in both CCDs are defined and modified by fitting the locations of RSGs in galaxies with a range of metallicity. The metal-poor galaxy NGC 6822 is taken as a case study for its low metallicity ([Fe/H] ≈ −1.0) and moderate distance (about 500 kpc). In the complete sample, we identify 1184 RSG, 1559 oxygen-rich AGB (O-AGBs), 1075 carbon-rich AGB (C-AGBs), and 140 extreme AGB (x-AGBs) candidates, with a contamination rate of approximately 20.5%, 9.7%, 6.8%, and 5.0%, respectively. We also present a pure sample, containing only the sources away from the dwarf branch, which includes 843 RSG, 1519 O-AGB, 1059 C-AGB, and 140 x-AGB candidates, with a contamination rate of approximately 6.5%, 8.8%, 6.1%, and 5.0%, respectively. About 600 and 450 RSG candidates are newly identified in the complete and pure samples, respectively, compared to the previous RSG sample in NGC 6822.

<title>Dynamics and Energetics of Resistive, Thermally Conductive, and Radiative Plasma in Coronal Current Sheets due to Asymmetric External Perturbation</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada1d6</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada1d6</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the asymmetric interaction of wave-like velocity perturbation with a coronal current sheet (CS) in the presence of resistivity, thermal conduction (TC), and radiative cooling (RC). We analyze the dynamics and energetics of the CS in four cases, namely, (i) no energy loss, (ii) TC only, (iii) RC only, and (iv) TC+RC. Before fragmentation, thinning and elongation of the CS are found to be identical in all four cases and therefore independent of the presence or absence of energy loss effects. Onset times, corresponding Lundquist numbers, and aspect ratios suggest that TC advances the onset of fragmentation while RC has the opposite effect in comparison to the absence of energy losses. Reconnection takes place at a higher rate in the presence of TC and TC+RC in the tearing unstable CS. Speeds of plasmoids are also found to be higher under the effect of TC and TC+RC. In the presence of TC and TC+RC, average density becomes higher within the tearing unstable CS than in the other two cases. As expected, the estimated average temperature is increasing with the highest and lowest rates in the absence of energy losses and in the presence of both TC and RC, respectively. After the onset of fragmentation, the rate of decrement of average magnetic energy density and increment of average kinetic energy density becomes higher in the presence of TC and TC+RC than in the other two cases. Thus, we conclude that the presence of energy-loss mechanisms critically influences the dynamics, energetics, and plasmoid formation within a reconnecting coronal CS.

<title>Nonthermal Velocities in a Solar Active Region Observed by SERTS</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada24d</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada24d</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present measurements of coronal nonthermal Doppler velocities in NOAA Active Region 7870 observed by the Solar EUV Research Telescope and Spectrograph during its 1995 sounding rocket flight (SERTS-95). The instrument included a multilayer-coated toroidal diffraction grating that enhanced its sensitivity in second order at wavelengths between about 171 and 225 Å. Analyses of spectra from this flight were previously published but did not address the issue of nonthermal velocities; we do so here for spectra averaged over the 123 8 segment of the slit for which the brightest portion of the region observed by SERTS was recorded. All emission lines are fit with Gaussian profiles. With post-flight laboratory spectra of He ii and Ne II-IIINe we derive a first-order instrumental width (full width at half-maximum intensity) of Finst,1 = 50.6 ± 3.1 mÅ and a second-order instrumental width of Finst,2 = 25.3 ±1.5 mÅ. For emission lines of Fe x−Fe xv, formed at 6.05 ≤ log T(K) ≤ 6.35, we find nonthermal velocities between 26.1 and 35.0 km s−1, independent of temperature; this range corresponds to Vnonth = 30.6 ± 4.5 km s−1. For the two unblended Fe xii lines at 192.394 and 193.509 Å closest to the maximum sensitivity of SERTS-95, we have Vnonth = 33.7 ± 1.3 km s−1. When solar observations are used to derive or confirm instrumental widths for spectrometers in orbit, those observations should compensate for nonthermal velocities such as the ones reported here in order to extract instrumental widths that are free of nonthermal broadening.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
From >1000 orbits of HST imaging, we present deep homogeneous resolved star color–magnitude diagrams that reach the oldest main-sequence turnoff and uniformly measured star formation histories (SFHs) of 36 dwarf galaxies (−6 ≥ MV ≥ −17) associated with the M31 halo, and for 10 additional fields in M31, M33, and the Giant Stellar Stream. From our SFHs, we find: (i) The median stellar age and quenching epoch of M31 satellites correlate with galaxy luminosity and galactocentric distance. Satellite luminosity and present-day distance from M31 predict the satellite quenching epoch to within 1.8 Gyr at all epochs. This tight relationship highlights the fundamental connection between satellite halo mass, environmental history, and star formation duration. (ii) There is no difference between the median SFH of galaxies on and off the great plane of Andromeda satellites. (iii) ~50% of our M31 satellites show prominent ancient star formation (>12 Gyr ago) followed by delayed quenching (8–10 Gyr ago), which is not commonly observed among the MW satellites. (iv) A comparison with TNG50 and FIRE-2 simulated satellite dwarfs around M31-like hosts shows that some of these trends (dependence of SFH on satellite luminosity) are reproduced in the simulations while others (dependence of SFH on galactocentric distance, presence of the delayed-quenching population) are weaker or absent. We provide all photometric catalogs and SFHs as High-Level Science Products on MAST.

<title>Ion Charge States from a Global Time-dependent Wave-turbulence-driven Model of the Solar Wind: Comparison with in Situ Measurements</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada253</link>

Solar wind charge-state measurements contain a wealth of knowledge related to the properties of the solar corona from where they originated. However, their interpretation has remained challenging because it convolves coronal temperature, density, and velocity along the particles’ trajectory through the corona before they “freeze in” and are convected outward through the solar wind. In this study, we calculate ion charge states by coupling a nonequilibrium ionization model with a global magnetohydrodynamic model of the corona and inner heliosphere. We present results for two periods characteristic of solar minimum and maximum and compare them with observations from the ACE spacecraft. We find that the model reproduces the essential features of the observations, rectifying an earlier inconsistency that was apparent in 1D calculations, and allows us to unambiguously trace the evolution of charge states from the base of the corona into the solar wind.

<title>Constraining Solar Emission Radius at 42 MHz During the 2024 Total Solar Eclipse Using a Student-commissioned Radio Telescope</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada26e</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada26e</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Low-frequency solar radio emission is sourced in the solar corona, with sub-100 MHz radio emission largely originating from the ∼105 K plasma around 2 optical radii. However, the region of emission has yet to be constrained at 35–45 MHz due to both instrumentation limitations and the rarity of astronomical events, such as total solar eclipses, which allow for direct observational approaches. In this work, we present the results from a student-led project to commission a low-frequency radio telescope array situated in the path of totality of the 2024 total solar eclipse in an effort to probe the middle corona. The Deployable Low-Band Ionosphere and Transient Experiment (DLITE) is a low-frequency radio array comprised of four dipole antennas, optimized to observe at 35–45 MHz, and capable of resolving the brightest radio sources in the sky. We constructed a DLITE station in Observatory Park, a dark-sky park in Montville, Ohio. Results of observations during the total solar eclipse demonstrate that DLITE stations can be quickly deployed for observations and provide constraints on the radius of solar emission at our center observing frequency of 42 MHz. In this work, we outline the construction of DLITE Ohio and the solar observation results from the total solar eclipse that transversed North America in 2024 April.

<title>A New Interpretation for the Hot Corona in Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada35e</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada35e</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work attempts to provide a new interpretation for the hot corona in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). A thin parabolic magnetic reconnection layer, anchored at the innermost disk and extending along the boundary of the magnetic tower for a few tens of gravitational radii, serves as a hard-X-ray source above the disk. Within this reconnection layer, the tearing instability leads to the formation of a chain of plasmoids, which contain relativistic electrons that generate X-ray radiation through inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of soft photons emitted by the accretion disk. Based on previous theoretical works and numerical simulations, we develop a heuristic framework to parameterize the geometry and magnetization of the reconnection layer, as well as to compute both the power of the IC-scattering radiation and the height of the reconnection layer. Our model allows for a quantitative investigation of the relation between the height of the corona and the X-ray radiation luminosity, which can be directly compared against the observed relation from X-ray reverberation mapping of individual AGNs. The theoretical results are in good agreement with the observations of IRAS 13224-3809, indicating the validation of our model.

<title>Ellipticities of Galaxy Cluster Halos from Halo–Shear–Shear Correlations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the first detection of the halo ellipticities of galaxy clusters by applying the halo–shear–shear correlations (HSSCs), without the necessity of using major axis determination. We use the Fourier_Quad shear catalog based on the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey and the group catalog from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Surveys for the measurement of group/cluster lensing and HSSC. Our analysis includes off-centering effects. We obtain the average projected ellipticity of dark matter halos with mass within a 1.3 virial radius to be . We divide the sample into two groups based on mass and redshift, and we find that halos with higher mass tend to exhibit increased ellipticity. We also reveal that high-richness halos have larger ellipticities, confirming the physical picture from numerical simulation that high-richness halos have a dynamical youth and more active mass accretion phase.

<title>Bulk Motions in the Black Hole Jet Sheath as a Candidate for the Comptonizing Corona</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada385</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada385</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using two-dimensional general relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the properties of the sheath separating the black hole jet from the surrounding medium. We find that the electromagnetic power flowing through the jet sheath is comparable to the overall accretion power of the black hole. The sheath is an important site of energy dissipation as revealed by the copious appearance of reconnection layers and plasmoid chains. About 20% of the sheath power is dissipated between 2 and 10 gravitational radii. The plasma in the dissipative sheath moves along a nearly paraboloidal surface with transrelativistic bulk motions dominated by the radial component, whose dimensionless 4-velocity is ∼1.2 ± 0.5. In the frame moving with the mean (radially dependent) velocity, the distribution of stochastic bulk motions resembles a Maxwellian with an “effective bulk temperature” of ∼100 keV. Scaling the global simulation to Cygnus X-1 parameters gives a rough estimate of the Thomson optical depth across the jet sheath, ∼0.01–0.1, and it may increase in future magnetohydrodynamic simulations with self-consistent radiative losses. These properties suggest that the dissipative jet sheath may be a viable “coronal” region, capable of upscattering seed soft photons into a hard, nonthermal tail, as seen during the hard states of X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei.

<title>Inner-heliospheric Signatures of Steadily Declining Solar Magnetic Fields and Their Possible Implications</title>

We examined solar photospheric magnetic fields for the solar cycles 21–25, covering the period 1975–2024. The unsigned photospheric magnetic fields at low latitudes (0°–45°), known as solar toroidal fields, showed a solar cycle variation with the total field strength being stronger during the maximum of cycle 25 than the maximum of cycle 24. However, the unsigned field strength of photospheric magnetic fields at high latitudes (45°–78°), known as solar polar fields, has shown a significant steady decline since around the mid-1990s. The unsigned field strength of solar polar fields, after an increase during 2015–2020, has declined again until 2024, continuing the declining trend for a long 30 yr. Also, we examined the solar wind microturbulence levels in the inner heliosphere (0.2–0.8 au), using interplanetary scintillation observations at 327 MHz, covering the period 1983–2022, that steadily declined since the mid-1990s and continued until 2022, synchronously with the solar polar fields. We found that the floor level in both solar toroidal fields and solar wind magnetic fields was reduced during the minimum of cycle 23 and recovered back during the minimum of cycle 24. In addition, a hemispherically asymmetric solar polar reversal was evident in the signed (axial) solar polar fields during cycles 21–25, with the reversal in cycle 25 for the northern hemisphere already completed but the same for the southern hemisphere yet to be completed. We discuss the implications of the long declining trend and other anomalies in solar cycle activity.

<title>Angular Power Spectrum of TeV–PeV Cosmic-Ray Anisotropies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Simulations of the cosmic-ray (CR) anisotropy down to TeV energies are presented, using turbulence parameters consistent with those inferred from observations of the interstellar medium. We compute the angular power spectra Cℓ of the CR anisotropy obtained from the simulations. We demonstrate that the amplitude of the large-scale gradient in the CR density profile affects only the overall normalization of the Cℓ values, without affecting the shape of the angular power spectrum. We show that the power spectrum depends on CR energy and that it is sensitive to the location of the observer at small ℓ. It is found to flatten at large ℓ and can be modeled by a broken power law, exhibiting a break at ℓ ≈ 4. Our computed power spectrum at ~10 TeV fits well HAWC and IceCube measurements. Moreover, we calculate all coefficients of the spherical harmonics and compute the component of the angular power spectrum projected onto the direction of the local magnetic field line. We find that deviations from gyrotropy become increasingly important at higher CR energies and larger values of ℓ.

Due to the inhomogeneity of electron number density, radio waves emitted by pulsars undergo scattering as they pass through the interstellar medium (ISM). However, a connection between large-scale pulsar scattering data and the structure of the Galactic ISM has yet to be established. In this paper, we explore the capability of pulsar scattering time data in discovering structures in the ISM. Using a large data set of scattering time measurements for 473 pulsars, we fit the pulsar reduced scattering intensity as a function of Galactic latitude and distance, constructing a smooth model of the Galactic pulsar scattering distribution. By comparing this smooth distribution with observational data, we identify two ISM structures responsible for pulsar scattering, one is associated with the Vela supernova remnant region within the Gum Nebula, while the other is a newly discovered structure—a distant superbubble, G38, located at a distance of 2.3 kpc with a size of ~50 pc. Analysis of the correlation coefficient of the pulsar scattering distribution shows that the correlation is dominated by structures smaller than 0.15 kpc—the closest separation approachable by the current data set. As measurements of the pulsar scattering time continue to increase in the future, they can potentially become an independent tool for exploring structures in the ISM.

<title>Ubiquitous Small-scale Extreme-ultraviolet Upflow-like Events above Network Regions Observed by the Solar Orbiter/Extreme Ultraviolet Imager</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Universal small-scale solar activity in the quiet region is suggested to be a potential source of solar wind and the upper solar atmosphere. Here, with the high-resolution 174 Å imaging observations from the Solar Orbiter/Extreme Ultraviolet Imager, we investigate 59 EUV upflow-like events observed in the quiet Sun. Their average apparent (plane-of-sky) velocity, lifetime, and propagation distance are measured as 62 km s−1, 68.6 s, and 3.94 Mm, respectively. These upflow-like events exhibit dynamic characteristics but lack base brightening, featuring a hot front and subsequent cold plasma ejection. A total of 39% of the EUV upflow-like events exhibit recurrent characteristics. Unprecedented high-resolution 174 Å observations reveal that some EUV upflow-like events exhibit blob-like fine structures and multistrand evolutionary features, and some upflow-like events can cause localized haze-like plasma heating ahead of their spire region during the ejection process. A subset of the EUV upflow-like events covered by the Solar Dynamics Observatory reveals that they appear at the chromospheric networks. Through emission measure analysis, we found that these upflow-like events eject hot plasma of transient region or coronal temperature (an average of ~105.5 K). We suggest that EUV upflow-like events may be EUV counterparts of chromospheric spicules and/or transition region network jets and play a role in heating the localized corona above the network regions.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Polarization spectra were predicted within the photosphere model. To seek more clues to distinguish between the models, both the time-resolved and time-integrated polarization spectra from optical band to MeV gamma-rays of the magnetic reconnection model are studied here. There are two newly found differences between the two models. First, the time-integrated polarization degree of the magnetic reconnection model would in general increase with frequency for on-axis observations, while it is not monotonous for the photosphere model. Second, the variations of both the time-integrated and the time-resolved polarization angles (PAs) with frequency of the magnetic reconnection model are not random, while the time-integrated PA varies randomly with frequency for the photosphere model. Therefore, future energy-resolved polarization analysis could distinguish between the two models. In addition, the PA rotation spectra are studied for the first time. The rotation value of PA within the burst duration will decrease with the increase of the observational energy band. Most significant PA rotation would happen for slightly off-axis observations in each energy band. The PA would rotate even for on-axis observations in the optical band. Compared with the aligned magnetic field case, the PA rotation is quite rare in the gamma-ray band for the case with a toroidal field in the radiation region.

<title>Impacts and Statistical Mitigation of Missing Data on the 21 cm Power Spectrum: A Case Study with the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The precise characterization and mitigation of systematic effects is one of the biggest roadblocks impeding the detection of the fluctuations of cosmological 21 cm signals. Missing data in radio cosmological experiments, often due to radio frequency interference (RFI), pose a particular challenge to power spectrum analysis as this could lead to the ringing of bright foreground modes in the Fourier space, heavily contaminating the cosmological signals. Here we show that the problem of missing data becomes even more arduous in the presence of systematic effects. Using a realistic numerical simulation, we demonstrate that partially flagged data combined with systematic effects can introduce significant foreground ringing. We show that such an effect can be mitigated through inpainting the missing data. We present a rigorous statistical framework that incorporates the process of inpainting missing data into a quadratic estimator of the 21 cm power spectrum. Under this framework, the uncertainties associated with our inpainting method and its impact on power spectrum statistics can be understood. These results are applied to the latest Phase II observations taken by the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array, forming a crucial component in power spectrum analyses as we move toward detecting 21 cm signals in the ever more noisy RFI environment.

<title>Streaming Torque with Turbulent Diffusion</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Fast type I migration of (proto)planets poses a challenging problem for the core accretion formation scenario. We found that the dust-induced “Streaming Torque” (ST) may slow down or even reverse the planet migration in Q. Hou & C. Yu. But in realistic protoplanetary disks, dust diffusion induced by gas turbulence may have important influences on ST. We perform linear analysis to investigate the effects of dust diffusion on ST. The dependence of ST on dust diffusion may provide better constraints on the turbulence strength and the stopping time τ. We derive the dispersion relation for all the wave modes in the two-fluid system. The dust diffusion will smooth the short-wavelength structure of the the quasi-drift mode and split it into two predominant D-drift modes with opposite directions. The outgoing D-drift mode will contribute to a negative torque on planets, particularly when τ ∼ 0.1, which slightly shifts the zero-torque turning point. We explore how ST depends on the regimes of aerodynamic drag, dust mass fraction, and disk scale height. We compare the radial wavenumbers of D-drift modes under different formulations of dust diffusion and find qualitative agreement. In all cases, τ at the zero-torque turning point, which determines the direction of planetary migration, consistently remains on the order of ∼0.1, corresponding to large pebble-sized dust grains. This suggests that rapid dust coagulation can inhibit the inward migration of planets, implying that weak gas turbulence may enhance the survival of protoplanets.

<title>Constraints on Primordial Black Holes from N eff: Scalar-induced Gravitational Waves as an Extra Radiation Component</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In 2023 June, multiple pulsar timing array collaborations provided evidence for the existence of a stochastic gravitational-wave background. Scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs), as one of the most likely sources of stochastic gravitational waves, have received widespread attention. When primordial curvature perturbations on small scales are sufficiently large, primordial black holes (PBHs) inevitably form, concurrently producing SIGWs with significant observable effects. These SIGWs can serve as an additional radiation component, influencing the relativistic degrees of freedom Neff. Taking into account primordial non-Gaussianity, we study the energy density spectrum of SIGWs up to the third order and use the current observational data of Neff to constrain small-scale primordial curvature perturbations and the abundance of PBHs.

<title>Jetted Seyfert Galaxies at z = 0: Simulating Feedback Effects on Galactic Morphology and Beyond</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9f29</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We use high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations to model feedback from Seyfert-type supermassive black hole (SMBH) jets onto galaxies with identical dark matter (DM) halos of log M/M⊙ ∼ 11.8. The low-mass, ∼106M⊙, seed SMBHs have been introduced when the parent DM halos have reached log M/M⊙ ∼ 11. In a controlled experiment, we vary only the efficiency of the SMBH accretion and focus on galaxies and their immediate environment properties. Our results show that the active galactic nucleus jet feedback has a substantial effect on the basic properties of Seyfert-type galaxies, such as morphology, gas fraction and distribution, star formation rate and distribution, B/D ratio, DM halo baryon fraction, and properties of the circumgalactic medium and beyond. These have been compared to a galaxy with supernovae only feedback. We focus on the energy deposition by the jet in the interstellar medium (ISM) and intergalactic gas medium, and follow the expansion of the multiple jet cocoons to ∼2 Mpc. We find that the jet–ISM interaction gradually pushes the star formation to larger radii with increasing accretion efficiency, which results in increased mass of the outer stellar disk, which is best fit as a double-exponential disk. Furthermore, we compare our galaxies and their properties with the observed nearby Seyfert galaxies, including the scaling relations, and find a close agreement, although statistical analysis of observed Seyferts is currently missing. In a forthcoming paper, we focus on the evolution of these objects at z ≲ 10 and study the effect of the SMBH seeding redshift.

<title>Elevated Rates of Tidal Disruption Events in Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b86</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b86</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Advances in time domain astronomy have produced a growing population of flares from galactic nuclei, including both tidal disruption events (TDEs) and flares in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Because TDEs are uncommon and AGN variability is abundant, large-amplitude AGN flares are usually not categorized as TDEs. While TDEs are normally channelled by the collisional process of two-body scatterings over a relaxation timescale, the quadrupole moment of a gas disk alters the stellar orbits, allowing them to collisionlessly approach the central massive black hole (MBH). This leads to an effectively enlarged loss cone, the loss wedge. Earlier studies found a moderate enhancement, up to a factor ~2–3, of TDE rates for a static axisymmetric perturbation. Here, we study the loss wedge problem for an evolving AGN disk, which can capture large number of stars into the growing loss wedge over much shorter times. The rates of collisionless TDEs produced by these time-evolving disks are much higher than the collisional rates in a static loss wedge. We calculate the response of a stellar population to the axisymmetric potential of an adiabatically growing AGN disk and find that the highest rates of collisionless TDEs are achieved for the largest (i) MBH masses M• and (ii) disk masses Md. For M• ~ 107M⊙ and Md ~ 0.1M•, the rate enhancement can be up to a factor . The orbits of collisionless TDEs sometimes have a preferred orientation in apses, carrying implications for observational signatures of resulting flares.

<title>High-energy Neutrino Source Cross-correlations with Nearest-neighbor Distributions</title>

The astrophysical origins of the majority of the IceCube neutrinos remain unknown. Effectively characterizing the spatial distribution of the neutrino samples and associating the events with astrophysical source catalogs can be challenging given the large atmospheric neutrino background and underlying non-Gaussian spatial features in the neutrino and source samples. In this paper, we investigate a framework for identifying and statistically evaluating the cross-correlations between IceCube data and an astrophysical source catalog based on the k-nearest-neighbor cumulative distribution functions (kNN-CDFs). We propose a maximum likelihood estimation procedure for inferring the true proportions of astrophysical neutrinos in the point-source data. We conduct a statistical power analysis of an associated likelihood ratio test with estimations of its sensitivity and discovery potential with synthetic neutrino data samples and a WISE–2MASS galaxy sample. We apply the method to IceCube’s public ten-year point-source data and find no statistically significant evidence for spatial cross-correlations with the selected galaxy sample. We discuss possible extensions to the current method and explore the method’s potential to identify the cross-correlation signals in data sets with different sample sizes.

<title>CEERS: Increasing Scatter along the Star-forming Main Sequence Indicates Early Galaxies Form in Bursts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the star formation rate–stellar mass (SFR–M*) relation for galaxies in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science survey at 4.5 ≤ z ≤ 12. We model the JWST and Hubble Space Telescope rest-UV and rest-optical photometry of galaxies with flexible star formation histories (SFHs) using BAGPIPES. We consider SFRs averaged from the SFHs over 10 Myr (SFR10) and 100 Myr (SFR100), where the photometry probes SFRs on these timescales, effectively tracing nebular emission lines in the rest-optical (on ~10 Myr timescales) and the UV/optical continuum (on ~100 Myr timescales). We measure the slope, normalization and intrinsic scatter of the SFR–M* relation, taking into account the uncertainty and the covariance of galaxy SFRs and M*. From z ~ 5 to 9 there is larger scatter in the SFR10–M* relation, with dex, compared to the SFR100–M* relation, with dex. This scatter increases with redshift and increasing stellar mass, at least out to z ~ 7. These results can be explained if galaxies at higher redshift experience an increase in star formation variability and form primarily in short, active periods, followed by a lull in star formation (i.e., “napping” phases). We see a significant trend in the ratio RSFR = SFR10/SFR100 in which, on average, RSFR decreases with increasing stellar mass and increasing redshift. This yields a star formation “duty cycle” of ~40% for galaxies with at z ~ 5, declining to ~20% at z ~ 9. Galaxies also experience longer lulls in star formation at higher redshift and at higher stellar mass, such that galaxies transition from periods of higher SFR variability at z ≳ 6 to smoother SFR evolution at z ≲ 4.5.

<title>Uniform Modeling of Observed Kilonovae: Implications for Diversity and the Progenitors of Merger-driven Long Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9c77</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present uniform modeling of eight kilonovae, five following short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs; including GRB 170817A) and three following long GRBs. We model their broadband afterglows to determine the relative contributions of afterglow and kilonova emission. We fit the kilonovae using a three-component model in MOSFiT, and report population median ejecta masses for the total, blue (κB = 0.5 cm2 g−1), purple (κP = 3 cm2 g−1), and red (κR = 10 cm2 g−1) components. The kilonova of GW170817 is near the sample median in most derived properties. We investigate trends between the ejecta masses and the isotropic-equivalent and beaming-corrected γ-ray energies (Eγ,iso, Eγ), as well as rest-frame durations (T90,rest). We find long GRB kilonovae have higher median red ejecta masses (Mej,R ≳ 0.05 M⊙) compared to on-axis short GRB kilonovae (Mej,R ≲ 0.02 M⊙). We also observe a weak scaling between the total and red ejecta masses with Eγ,iso and Eγ, though a larger sample is needed to establish a significant correlation. These findings imply a connection between merger-driven long GRBs and larger tidal dynamical ejecta masses, which may indicate that their progenitors are asymmetric compact object binaries. We produce representative kilonova light curves, and find that the planned depths and cadences of the Rubin and Roman Observatory surveys will be sufficient for order-of-magnitude constraints on Mej,B (and, for Roman, Mej,P and Mej,R) of future kilonovae at z ≲ 0.1.

<title>The Observed Phase Space of Mass-loss History from Massive Stars Based on Radio Observations of a Large Supernova Sample</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9e93</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9e93</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this work, we study the circumstellar material (CSM) around massive stars, and the mass-loss rates depositing this CSM, using a large sample of radio observations of 325 core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe; only ~22% of them being detected). This sample comprises both archival data and our new observations of 99 CCSNe conducted with the AMI-LA radio array in a systematic approach devised to constrain the mass loss at different stages of stellar evolution. In the supernova (SN)–CSM interaction model, observing the peak of the radio emission of an SN provides the CSM density at a given radius (and therefore the mass-loss rate that deposited this CSM). On the other hand, limits on the radio emission, and/or on the peak of the radio emission provide a region in the CSM phase space that can be ruled out. Our analysis shows a discrepancy between the values of mass-loss rates derived from radio-detected and radio-nondetected SNe. Furthermore, we rule out mass-loss rates in the range of 2 × 10−6–10−4M⊙ yr−1 for different epochs during the last 1000 yr before the explosion (assuming wind velocity of 10 km s−1) for the progenitors of ~80% of the Type II supernovae (SNe II) in our sample. In addition, we rule out the ranges of mass-loss rates suggested for red supergiants for ~50% of the progenitors of SNe II in our sample. We emphasize here that these results take a step forward in constraining mass loss in winds from a statistical point of view.

<title>Study of Satellite Plane Structure Characteristics Based on TNG50 Simulations: A Comparative Analysis from Plane to Nonplane Structures</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In recent years, multiple plane structures of satellite galaxies have been identified in the nearby Universe, although their formation mechanisms remain unclear. In this work, we employ the TNG50-1 numerical simulation to classify satellite systems into plane and nonplane structures, based on their geometric and dynamical properties. We focus on comparing the characteristics of these plane and nonplane structures. The plane structures in TNG50-1 exhibit a mean height of 5.24 kpc, with most of them found in galaxy groups with intermediate halo virial masses within the narrow range of 1011.5–1012.5M⊙. Statistical analyses reveal that plane structures of satellite galaxies constitute approximately 11.30% in TNG50-1, with this proportion increasing to 27.11% in TNG100-1, aligning closely with previous observations. Additionally, central galaxies in clusters and groups hosting corotating plane structures are intermediate massive and slightly metal-poorer than those in nonplane structures. Significant differences are found between in-plane and out-of-plane satellite galaxies, suggesting that in-plane satellites exhibit slightly longer formation times and more active interstellar matter cycles. The satellites within these plane structures in TNG50-1 exhibit similar radial distributions with observations but are fainter and more massive than those in observational plane structures due to the over- or underestimation of galaxy properties in simulations. Our analysis also shows that the satellite plane structures might be affected by some low- or high-mass galaxies temporarily entering the plane structures due to the gravitational potential of the clusters and groups after the plane structures had formed.

<title>Study on the Shallow Decay Segment of Gamma-Ray Burst X-Ray Afterglow</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada0b9</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada0b9</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The X-ray afterglow of a certain fraction of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) comprises a phase of shallow decay. However, the origin of the shallow decay segment is still a mystery. In this paper, we select 103 GRBs that exhibit a shallow decay segment, based on Swift/XRT data prior to 2023 June. We apply the fallback accretion energy external dissipation model to the shallow decay segment in our sample, and find the model can interpret the shallow decay segment within a reasonable range of parameter space. The fallback rate of the progenitor envelope materials onto the accretion disk can reach a peak of 10−7–0.1 M⊙ s−1 within a time frame of 10–105 s, which is consistent with the typical density profile and spin profile of the progenitor of a GRB. During the fallback process of progenitor envelope materials, progenitor stars of most GRBs have the highest fallback rate at a radius ~1010 cm, which is consistent with the typical radius of a Wolf–Rayet star. The production of shallow decay segments of most GRBs in our sample requires injecting Blandford–Znajek (BZ) energy equal to 10–100 times the kinetic energy of the initial GRB blast wave into the blast wave. However, the shallow decay segment of a few GRBs requires the injected energy to be comparable to the kinetic energy of the blast wave, which means that even if less energy is injected into a GRB blast wave, it is still possible to produce a shallow decay segment. In addition, the peak time of the fallback rate of the progenitor envelope materials is close to the time when BZ energy is injected into the blast wave, which means that the fallback accretion is more active in the initial phase. In summary, our research results provide further support to an external origin for the shallow decay segment in GRBs.

<title>COOL-LAMPS. VII. Quantifying Strong-lens Scaling Relations with 177 Cluster-scale Strong Gravitational Lenses in DECaLS</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We estimate the Einstein-radius-enclosed total mass for 177 cluster-scale strong gravitational lenses identified by the ChicagO Optically selected Lenses Located At the Margins of Public Surveys (COOL-LAMPS) collaboration with lens redshifts ranging from 0.2 ⪅ z ⪅ 1.0 using the brightest-cluster-galaxy (BCG) redshift and an observable proxy for the Einstein radius. We constrain the Einstein-radius-enclosed luminosity and stellar mass by fitting parametric spectral energy distributions to aperture photometry from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) in the g-, r-, and z-band Dark Energy Camera filters. We find that the BCG redshift, enclosed total mass, and enclosed luminosity are strongly correlated and well described by a planar relationship in 3D space. We find that the enclosed total mass and stellar mass are correlated with a logarithmic slope of , and the enclosed total mass and stellar-to-total mass fraction are correlated with a logarithmic slope of . In tandem with the small radii within which these slopes are constrained, this may suggest invariance in baryon conversion efficiency and feedback strength as a function of cluster-centric radii in galaxy clusters. Additionally, the correlations described here should have utility in ranking strong-lensing candidates in upcoming imaging surveys—such as Rubin/Legacy Survey of Space and Time—in which an algorithmic treatment of strong lenses will be needed due to the sheer volume of data these surveys will produce.

<title>Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs). XXI. Candidate Red Quasars at z ≥ 6 from Near-infrared Photometry</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present an analysis of near-infrared photometry of 59 quasars at 5.83 < z < 7.07, obtained with the Gemini North Telescope and the Gran Telescopio CANARIAS. The sample consists of low-luminosity quasars discovered in the Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) project. With the near-infrared magnitudes combined with the optical photometric and spectroscopic data from the previous Hyper Suprime-Cam and SHELLQs observations, we searched for red (dust-reddened) quasars, characterized by the color excess of E(B − V) > 0.1. We identified five red quasar candidates. The low fraction (8%) of red quasars in our sample suggests that the low luminosity of the SHELLQs quasars is mostly due to the nature of the quasars, not due to extinction by dust. The candidates tend to be found on the low-luminosity side (measured with the rest-ultraviolet absolute magnitude at 1450 Å of M1450 > −24 mag) of the sample. This luminosity trend may support the idea that red quasars represent an evolutionary stage preceding unobscured quasars, often invoked in the merger-driven galaxy evolution scenario.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The solar corona is highly structured by bunches of magnetic field lines forming either loops, or twisted flux ropes representing prominences/filaments, or very dynamic structures such as jets. The aim of this paper is to understand the interaction between filament channels and jets. We use high-resolution Hα spectra obtained by the ground-based telescope Télescope Héliographique pour l'Etude du Magnétisme et des Instabilités Solaires on the Canary Islands and data from Helioseismic Magnetic Imager and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. In this paper we present a multiwavelength study of the interaction of filaments and jets. They both consist of cool plasma embedded in magnetic structures. A jet is particularly well studied in all the AIA channels with a flow reaching 100–180 km s−1. Its origin is linked to cancelling flux at the edge of the active region. Large Doppler shifts in Hα are derived in a typical area for a short time (order of minute). They correspond to flows around 140 km s−1. In conclusion we conjecture that these flows correspond to some interchange of magnetic field lines between the filament channel and the jets leading to cool plasmoid ejections or reconnection jets perpendicularly to the jet trajectory.

<title>Discrepancies between JWST Observations and Simulations of Quenched Massive Galaxies at z > 3: A Comparative Study with IllustrisTNG and ASTRID</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent JWST observations have uncovered an unexpectedly large population of massive quiescent galaxies at z > 3. Using the cosmological simulations IllustrisTNG and ASTRID, we identify analogous galaxies and investigate their abundance, formation, quenching mechanisms, and post-quenching evolution for stellar masses . We apply three different quenching definitions and find that both simulations significantly underestimate the comoving number density of quenched massive galaxies at z ≳ 3 compared to JWST observations by up to ∼2 dex. In both simulations, the high-z quenched massive galaxies often host overmassive central black holes above the local MBH–M⋆ relation, implying that AGN feedback is key in quenching galaxies in the early Universe. The typical quenching timescales for these galaxies are ∼200–600 Myr. IllustrisTNG primarily employs AGN kinetic feedback, while ASTRID relies on AGN thermal feedback at z > 2.3, which is less effective and has a longer quenching timescale. Although these simulations differ in many aspects, making a direct comparison challenging, our findings suggest the need for improved physical models of AGN feedback in galaxy formation simulations. At lower stellar masses, the quenched galaxies have denser local environments than the star-forming galaxies, suggesting that environmental quenching helps quench less-massive galaxies. We also study the post-quenching evolution of the high-z massive quiescent galaxies and find that many experience subsequent reactivation of star formation, evolving into primary progenitors of z = 0 brightest cluster galaxies.

<title>Multiple Episodes of Remote Brightenings Driven by a Coronal Extreme-ultraviolet Jet on the Sun</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Remote brightening (RB) is compact brightening at footpoints of magnetic loops, which are remotely connecting to and confining an eruption in the solar atmosphere. Here, we report on observations of an RB resulting from an EUV jet with a speed of about 90 km s−1. The loops connecting the RB and the jet have an apparent length of about 59 Mm. Intriguingly, the RB exhibits at least two episodes of brightenings, as characterized by two peaks in its lightcurve. The energies that sustain the first and second peaks of the RB are 6.3 × 1026 erg and 8.4 × 1026 erg, respectively, and comprise a significant proportion of the total energy. The first peak of the RB brightenings coincides with the jet's peak with a time delay of 12 s, while the second peak lags behind by 108 s. Besides the flows of the ejecta, we have identified two additional flows originating from the eruption site. One is relatively cool with a temperature of –6.1 and a speed of about 275 ± 15 km s−1. The other is hot with a temperature of –7.3 and a much greater speed of about 750 ± 70 km s−1. We attribute the second peak of RB directly to this hot flow, which our numerical experiments suggest is the result of a slow shock wave. Considering the minimal time delay between the first peak of RB and the eruption, we infer that this first episode is due to heating by nonthermal electrons. Our research demonstrates that the dynamics in an RB can offer vital insights into the nature of the corresponding eruption and help understand how energy is distributed throughout the solar atmosphere.

<title>Electron Acceleration by Multiple Fast Fermi Reflections at Earth’s Bow Shock</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada5f0</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The generation of energetic particles in the Universe is an important topic in astrophysical and space physics. Although the diffusive shock acceleration has been acknowledged to play an essential role in particle acceleration, the injection problem has not been well resolved yet. Using measurements from the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft, we report unexpected spiky enhancements of energetic electron flux in the upstream region of the Earth’s bow shock. Such enhancements are then demonstrated to result from the accelerated electron population by shock reflection. Meanwhile, the magnetic field exhibits no variations except an increase in radius of curvature. Based on the results above, we uncover the underlying acceleration scenario. When the interplanetary magnetic field with a proper curvature approaches the bow shock, the two ends of a magnetic field line may touch the shock front earlier than its middle part. Magnetic mirror points form at the two field-line-shock intersections. The solar wind electrons are therefore trapped and bounce between two mirror points. Eventually, these electrons undergo fast Fermi reflection several times and gain substantial energies. The spacecraft observation of accelerated electrons is reproduced with a numerical method based on the reflection model. Such an acceleration process may be a potential solution to the injection problem.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Observations of the Milky Way and external galaxies support the idea that large-scale magnetic fields are concentrated in galactic disks, with halo magnetic fields at least an order of magnitude weaker. However, very little is known about the transition between the two. We present the discovery of linearly polarized radio emission at the interface between interacting shells of gas within a well-known grouping of high-velocity clouds (HVCs), the anticenter shell. Faraday rotation of diffuse emission and of background extragalactic compact sources demonstrates an enhancement of the field at the interface. This is the clearest observed example of an HVC altering the large-scale magnetic field at the disk–halo interface and is the first image of magnetic field effects in an HVC. These results demonstrate the possibility of future three-dimensional reconstruction of the Galactic magnetic field and showcase the versatility of the Synthesis Telescope at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory as one of the few existing telescopes that can exploit this new method of probing Galactic magnetism.

<title>The 100 pc White Dwarf Sample in the SDSS Footprint. II. A New Look at the Spectral Evolution of White Dwarfs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We increase the spectroscopic completeness of the 100 pc white dwarf sample in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey footprint with 840 additional spectra. Our spectroscopy is 86% complete for white dwarfs hotter than Teff = 5000 K, where Hα remains visible and provides reliable constraints on the atmospheric composition. We identify 2108 DA white dwarfs with pure hydrogen atmospheres, and show that ultramassive DA white dwarfs with M ≥ 1.1 M⊙ are an order of magnitude less common below 10,000 K. This is consistent with a fraction of them getting stuck on the crystallization sequence due to 22Ne distillation. In addition, there are no ultramassive DA white dwarfs with M ≥ 1.1M⊙ and Teff ≤ 6000 K in our sample, likely because Debye cooling makes them rapidly fade away. We detect a significant trend in the fraction of He atmosphere white dwarfs as a function of temperature; the fraction increases from 9% at 20,000 K to 32% at 6000 K. This provides direct evidence of convective mixing in cool DA white dwarfs. Finally, we detect a relatively tight sequence of low-mass DQ white dwarfs in color–magnitude diagrams for the first time. We discuss the implications of this tight DQ sequence, and conclude with a discussion of the future prospects from the upcoming Ultraviolet Transient Astronomy Satellite mission and the large-scale multi-fiber spectroscopic surveys.

Chemical characterization of the Galactic center is essential for understanding its formation and structural evolution. Trends of alpha (α) elements, such as magnesium, silicon, and calcium, serve as powerful diagnostic tools, offering insights into star formation rates and gas-infall history. However, high extinction has previously hindered such studies. In this study, we present a detailed chemical abundance analysis of M giants in the Milky Way's nuclear star cluster (NSC), focusing on α-element trends with metallicity. High-resolution, near-infrared spectra were obtained using the Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrograph on the Gemini South telescope for nine M giants. Careful selection of spectral lines, based on a solar-neighborhood control sample of 50 M giants, was implemented to minimize systematic uncertainties. Our findings show enhanced α-element abundances in the predominantly metal-rich NSC stars, consistent with trends in the inner bulge. The NSC stars follow the high-[α/Fe] envelope seen in the solar vicinity's metal-rich population, indicating a high star formation rate. The α-element trends decrease with increasing metallicity, also at the highest metallicities. Our results suggest the NSC population likely shares a similar evolutionary history with the inner bulge, challenging the idea of a recent dominant star formation burst. This connection between the NSC and the inner-disk sequence suggests that the chemical properties of extragalactic NSCs of Milky Way–type galaxies could serve as a proxy for understanding the host galaxies’ evolutionary processes.

<title>Hydrogen Column Density Variability in a Sample of Local Compton-thin AGN II</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9c64</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the multiepoch analysis of 13 variable, nearby (z ≲ 0.1), and Compton-thin (1022 < NH < 1.5 × 1024 cm−2) active galactic nuclei (AGN) selected from the 105-month BAT catalog. Analyzing all available archival soft and hard X-ray observations, we investigate the line-of-sight hydrogen column density (NH,los) variability on timescales ranging from a few days to approximately 20 yr. Each source is analyzed by simultaneously modeling the data with three physical torus models, providing tight constraints on torus properties, including the covering factor, the cloud dispersion, and the torus average hydrogen column density (NH,av). Our final sample includes 27 variable, Compton-thin AGN after implementing another 14 AGN analyzed in our previous work. We find that all sources require either flux or NH,los variability. Based on the degree of variability, we classify 37% of them as “NH,los Variable,” 44% as “Nonvariable in NH,los,” and 19% as “Undetermined.” Noticeably, there is no discernible difference between geometrical and intrinsic properties among the three variability classes, suggesting no intrinsic differences between the NH,los-variable and nonvariable sources within the considered sample. We measure the median variation in NH,los between any observation pair of the same source to be 25% with respect to the lowest NH,los measure in the pair. Furthermore, 48% of the analyzed sources require the inclusion of a Compton-thick reflector in the spectral fitting. Among these, 30% exhibit recorded 22 GHz water megamaser emission, suggesting a potential shared nature between the two structures.

<title>A Pride of Satellites in the Constellation Leo? Discovery of the Leo VI Milky Way Satellite Ultra-faint Dwarf Galaxy with DELVE Early Data Release 3</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the discovery and spectroscopic confirmation of an ultra-faint Milky Way satellite in the constellation of Leo. This system was discovered as a spatial overdensity of resolved stars observed with Dark Energy Camera (DECam) data from an early version of the third data release of the DECam Local Volume Exploration (or DELVE) survey. The low luminosity ( ; ), large size ( pc), and large heliocentric distance ( kpc) are all consistent with the population of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs). Using Keck/DEIMOS observations of the system, we were able to spectroscopically confirm nine member stars, while measuring a tentative mass-to-light ratio of and a nonzero metallicity dispersion of , further confirming Leo VI’s identity as a UFD. While the system has a highly elliptical shape, , we do not find any conclusive evidence that it is tidally disrupting. Moreover, despite the apparent on-sky proximity of Leo VI to members of the proposed Crater-Leo infall group, its smaller heliocentric distance and inconsistent position in energy–angular momentum space make it unlikely that Leo VI is part of the proposed infall group.

<title>Segue 2 Recently Collided with the Cetus-Palca Stream: New Opportunities to Constrain Dark Matter in an Ultra-faint Dwarf</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Stellar streams in the Milky Way are promising detectors of low-mass dark matter (DM) subhalos predicted by ΛCDM. Passing subhalos induce perturbations in streams that indicate the presence of the subhalos. Understanding how known DM-dominated satellites impact streams is a crucial step toward using stream perturbations to constrain the properties of dark perturbers. Here, we cross-match a Gaia Early Data Release 3 and SEGUE member catalog of the Cetus-Palca stream (CPS) with H3 for additional radial velocity measurements and fit the orbit of the CPS using this six-dimensional (6D) data. We demonstrate for the first time that the ultra-faint dwarf Segue 2 had a recent (77 ± 5 Myr ago) close flyby (within the stream's 2σ width) with the CPS. This interaction enables constraints on Segue 2’s mass and density profile at larger radii ( kpc) than are probed by its stars ( pc). While Segue 2 is not expected to strongly affect the portion of the stream covered by our 6D data, we predict that if Segue 2’s mass within ∼ 6 kpc is 5 × 109M⊙, the CPS's velocity dispersion will be ∼ 40 km s−1 larger at ϕ1 > 20° than at ϕ1 < 0°. If no such heating is detected, Segue 2’s mass cannot exceed 109M⊙ within ∼ 6 kpc. The proper motion distribution of the CPS near the impact site is mildly sensitive to the shape of Segue 2’s density profile. This study presents a critical test for frameworks designed to constrain properties of dark subhalos from stream perturbations.

<title>Morphology of 137 Fast Radio Bursts Down to Microsecond Timescales from the First CHIME/FRB Baseband Catalog</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b11</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b11</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a spectro-temporal analysis of 137 fast radio bursts (FRBs) from the first CHIME/FRB baseband catalog, including 125 one-off bursts and 12 repeat bursts, down to microsecond resolution using the least-squares optimization fitting routine fitburst. We measure subburst components within burst envelopes as narrow as ~23 μs (FWHM), with 20% of the sample displaying substructures narrower than 100 μs, offering constraints on emission mechanisms. Scattering timescales in the sample range from 30 μs to 13 ms at 600 MHz. Our measured values are compared with those in the first CHIME/FRB intensity catalog, revealing that nearly one-third of our sample exhibits additional burst components at higher time resolutions. We observe no correlations between scattering time and dispersion measure, rotation measure, or linear polarization fraction, with the latter suggesting that depolarization due to multipath propagation is negligible in our sample. Bursts with narrower envelopes (≤1 ms) in our sample exhibit higher flux densities, indicating the potential presence of submillisecond FRBs that are being missed by our real-time system below a brightness threshold. Most multicomponent bursts in our sample exhibit subburst separations of ≤1 ms, with no bursts showing separations < 41 μs, even at a time resolution of 2.56 μs, but both scattering and low signal-to-noise ratio can hinder the detection of additional components. Lastly, given the morphological diversity of our sample, we suggest that one-off and repeating FRBs can come from different classes but have overlapping property distributions.

<title>Fuzzy Galaxies or Cirrus? Decomposition of Galactic Cirrus in Deep Wide-field Images</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b25</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Diffuse Galactic cirrus, or diffuse Galactic light (DGL), can be a prominent component in the background of deep wide-field imaging surveys. The DGL provides unique insights into the physical and radiative properties of dust grains in our Milky Way, and it also serves as a contaminant on deep images, obscuring the detection of background sources such as low surface brightness galaxies. However, it is challenging to disentangle the DGL from other components of the night sky. In this paper, we present a technique for the photometric characterization of Galactic cirrus based on (1) extraction of its filamentary or patchy morphology and (2) incorporation of color constraints obtained from Planck thermal dust models. Our decomposition method is illustrated using a ~10 deg2 imaging data set obtained by the Dragonfly Telephoto Array, and its performance is explored using various metrics that characterize the flatness of the sky background. As a concrete application of the technique, we show how removal of cirrus allows low surface brightness galaxies to be identified on cirrus-rich images. We also show how modeling the cirrus in this way allows optical DGL intensities to be determined with high radiometric precision.

<title>Deep Swift/UVOT Observations of GOODS-N and the Evolution of the Ultraviolet Luminosity Function at 0.2 < z < 1.2</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present Swift Ultraviolet Optical Telescope (UVOT) observations of the deep field GOODS-N in four near-UV filters. A catalog of detected galaxies is reported, which will be used to explore galaxy evolution using UV emission. Swift/UVOT observations probe galaxies at z ≲ 1.5 and combine a wide field of view with moderate spatial resolution; these data complement the wide-field observations of Galaxy Evolution Explorer and the deep, high-angular-resolution observations by Hubble Space Telescope. Using our catalog of detected galaxies, we calculate the UV galaxy number counts as a function of apparent magnitude and compute the UV luminosity function (LF) and its evolution with redshift. From the LF fits in various redshift bins, we calculate the star formation rate density as a function of redshift and find evolution consistent with past works. We explore how different assumptions such as dust attenuation corrections can dramatically change how quickly the corrected star formation rate density changes with redshift. At these low redshifts, we find no trend between UV attenuation and redshift or absolute magnitude with significant scatter in the UV spectral slope β. This data set will complement the extensive observations of GOODS-N already in the literature.

<title>ALMA/SCUBA-2 COSMOS Survey: Properties of X-Ray- and SED-selected Active Galactic Nuclei in Bright Submillimeter Galaxies</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9f3b</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9f3b</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the properties of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the brightest submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) in the COSMOS field. We utilize the bright sample of the ALMA/SCUBA-2 COSMOS Survey (AS2COSMOS), which consists of 260 SMGs with S870 μm = 0.7–19.2 mJy at z = 0–6. We perform optical to millimeter spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling for the whole sample. We identify 24 AGN-host galaxies from the SEDs. Supplemented by 23 X-ray-detected AGNs (X-ray AGNs), we construct an overall sample of 40 AGN-host galaxies. The X-ray luminosity upper bounds indicate that the X-ray-undetected SED-identified AGNs are likely to be nearly Compton thick or have unusually suppressed X-ray emission. From visual classification, we identify % of the SMGs without AGNs as major merger candidates. This fraction is almost consistent with the general galaxy population at z ∼ 2, suggesting that major mergers are not necessarily required for the enhanced star formation in SMGs. We also identify % of the AGN hosts as major merger candidates, which is about twice as high as that in the SMGs without AGNs. This suggests that major mergers play a key role in triggering AGN activity in bright SMGs.

<title>A Second Candidate Magnetic Helium Core White Dwarf and 3 Other Variable White Dwarfs in the Globular Cluster NGC 6397</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada144</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada144</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using archival Hubble Space Telescope observations, we report the discovery of four variable low-mass white dwarfs (WDs; 0.18 M⊙ ≤ M ≤ 0.5 M⊙) in the globular cluster NGC 6397. One source exhibits a periodic optical modulation of 5.21 ± 0.02 hr, which we interpret as potentially due to the rotation of a magnetic helium core WD (He WD). This makes this candidate the second magnetic He WD in NGC 6397, and one of the few He WDs with a measured rotation period. The other three candidates show aperiodic variability, with a change in magnitude ranging from ∼0.11 to 0.6. These discoveries highlight the importance of high-cadence photometric surveys in dense stellar environments. Follow-up spectroscopic observations are needed to confirm the nature of the variability of these systems.

<title>Bar Instability and Formation Timescale across Toomre’s Q Parameter and Central Mass Concentration: Slow Bar Formation or True Stability</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada35f</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada35f</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the bar formation process using N-body simulations across the Toomre’s parameter Q and central mass concentration (CMC), focusing principally on the formation timescale. Of importance is that, as suggested by cosmological simulations, disk galaxies have a limited time of ~8 Gyr in the Universe’s timeline to evolve secularly, starting when they became physically and kinematically steady to prompt the bar instability. By incorporating this time limit, bar-unstable disks are further subdivided into those that establish a bar before and after that time, namely, the normal and the slowly bar-forming disks. Simulations demonstrate that evolutions of bar strengths and configurations of the slowly bar-forming and the bar-stable cases are nearly indistinguishable prior to 8 Gyr, albeit dynamically distinct, while differences can be noticed afterward. Differentiating them before 8 Gyr is possible by identifying the proto-bar, a signature of bar development visible in kinematical maps such as the Fourier spectrogram and the angular velocity field, which emerges in the former group 1–2 Gyr before the fully developed bar, whereas it is absent in the latter group until 8 Gyr and such bar-stable disk remains unbarred until at least 10 Gyr. In addition, we find complicated interplays between Q and CMC in regulating the bar formation. First, disk stabilization requires both high Q and CMC. Either high Q or high CMC only results in slow bar formation. Second, some hot disks can form a bar more rapidly than the colder ones in a specific range of Q and CMC.

<title>Dynamic Evolution of Magnetic Flux Ropes in Active Region 11429. II. Magnetic Characteristic of the Footpoints During the Preeruption and Eruption Phases</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada383</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada383</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Magnetic flux rope (MFRs) are the most probable core structure of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Their footpoints on the photosphere are the only feature for which their magnetic properties can be accurately measured, and to some extent, determine the property of the whole MFR. So far, the magnetic properties of footpoints are still a mystery. Y. Zhang et al. presented the dynamic evolution of four MFRs involved in a major eruption. For this special event, the footpoints of the MFRs could be identified by extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) brightening and MFR morphology during the preeruption phase, and by conjunction, EUV dimming during the eruption phase. This is a new effort to identify the footpoints of MFRs during the preeruption phase. This identification discloses that all footpoints originate out of the umbra and penumbra of the sunspots. The footpoint areas and magnetic flux during the preeruption phase are about 107 km2 and around the order of 1019–1020 Mx, respectively. During the eruption phase, the footpoint area and the magnetic flux are about 108 km2 and around the order of 1020 Mx, respectively. The temporal evolution of the magnetic features around the footpoints disclose that all footpoint pairs belong to nonconjugated opposite polarities. This observational evidence will help us to understand the magnetic nature of MFRs and their associated CMEs.

<title>The Hidden Magnetic Structures of a Solar Intermediate Filament Revealed by the Injected Flare Material</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9d13</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Solar filaments are spectacular objects in the solar atmosphere, consisting of accumulations of cool, dense, and partially ionized plasma suspended in the hot solar corona against gravity. The magnetic structures that support the filament material remain elusive, partly due to the lack of high-resolution magnetic field measurements in the chromosphere and corona. In this study, we reconstruct the magnetic structures of a solar intermediate filament using EUV observations and two different methods, to follow the injection of hot material from a B-class solar flare. Our analysis reveals the fine-scale magnetic structures of the filament, including a compact set of mutually wrapped magnetic fields encasing the cool filament material, two groups of helical magnetic structures intertwining with the main filament, and a series of arched magnetic loops positioned along the filament. Additionally, we find that the northern footpoints of the helical structures are rooted in the same location, while their southern footpoints are rooted in different areas. The results obtained in this study offer new insights into the formation and eruption mechanisms of solar filaments.

<title>A Study of the Star Clusters’ Population in the Giant Molecular Cloud G174+2.5</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad957d</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad957d</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the structure, interstellar absorption, color–magnitude diagrams (CMDs), kinematics, and dynamical state of embedded star clusters in the star-forming region associated with the giant molecular cloud G174+2.5. Our investigation is based on photometric data from the UKIDSS Galactic Plane Survey catalog and astrometric data from the Gaia DR3 catalogs. First, we recover all the known embedded clusters and candidate clusters in the region using surface density maps. Then, for the detected clusters, we determine their general parameters: the center positions, radii, number of stars, and reddening. To evaluate the reddening, we use both the NICEST algorithm and the Q-method. Both methods produce consistent extinction maps in the regions of the four studied clusters. However, the Q-method yields a much smaller color scatter in the CMD. For four clusters in particular (S235 North-West, S235 A-B-C, S235 Central, and S235 East1+East2), we were able to compute individual membership probabilities, the cluster distances, the cluster masses, and their average proper motions. By building on these results, we have studied the clusters’ kinematics and dynamics. Moreover, we estimate the mass of the gas component and the star formation efficiency in the regions of these four clusters. Finally, we provide an estimate of the total energy of the stellar and gas components in the area of these four clusters to determine whether the clusters are bound (here, we consider a “cluster” as the system “stars + gas”). The gravitational bound strongly depends on the region for which we estimate the gas mass. If we consider the mass of the entire cloud, all these four clusters turn out to be bound.

<title>Extreme Heating of Minor Ions in Imbalanced Solar-wind Turbulence</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad95fc</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad95fc</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Minor ions in the solar corona are heated to extreme temperatures, far in excess of those of the electrons and protons that comprise the bulk of the plasma. These highly nonthermal distributions make minor ions sensitive probes of the collisionless processes that heat the corona and power the solar wind. The recent discovery of the “helicity barrier” offers a mechanism in which imbalanced Alfvénic turbulence in low-β plasmas preferentially heats protons over electrons, generating high-frequency, proton-cyclotron-resonant fluctuations. We use the hybrid-kinetic particle-in-cell code Pegasus++ to drive imbalanced Alfvénic turbulence in a 3D low-β plasma with additional passive ion species, He2+ and O5+. A helicity barrier naturally develops, followed by clear phase-space signatures of oblique proton-cyclotron-wave heating and Landau-resonant heating from the imbalanced Alfvénic fluctuations. The former results in characteristically arced ion velocity distribution functions, whose non-bi-Maxwellian features are shown by linear ALPS calculations to be critical to the heating process. Additional features include a steep transition-range electromagnetic spectrum, proton-cyclotron waves propagating in the direction of the imbalance, significantly enhanced proton-to-electron heating ratios, ion temperatures that are considerably more perpendicular with respect to magnetic field, and extreme heating of heavier species in a manner consistent with mass scalings inferred from spacecraft measurements. None of these features are realized in an otherwise equivalent simulation of balanced turbulence. If seen simultaneously in the fast solar wind, these signatures of the helicity barrier would testify to the necessity of incorporating turbulence imbalance in a complete theory for the evolution of the solar wind.

<title>Discovery and Spectroscopic Confirmation of Aquarius III: A Low-mass Milky Way Satellite Galaxy</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8eba</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8eba</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the discovery of Aquarius III, an ultra-faint Milky Way satellite galaxy identified in the second data release of the DECam Local Volume Exploration survey. Based on deeper follow-up imaging with DECam, we find that Aquarius III is a low-luminosity ( ), extended ( pc) stellar system located in the outer halo (D⊙ = 85 ± 4 kpc). From medium-resolution Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy, we identify 11 member stars and measure a mean heliocentric radial velocity of for the system and place an upper limit of σv < 3.5 km s−1 (σv < 1.6 km s−1) on its velocity dispersion at the 95% (68%) credible level. Based on calcium-triplet metallicities of the six brightest red giant members, we find that Aquarius III is very metal-poor ([Fe/H]= − 2.61 ± 0.21) with a statistically significant metallicity spread ( dex). We interpret this metallicity spread as strong evidence that the system is a dwarf galaxy as opposed to a star cluster. Combining our velocity measurement with Gaia proper motions, we find that Aquarius III is currently situated near its orbital pericenter in the outer halo (rperi = 78 ± 7 kpc) and that it is plausibly on first infall onto the Milky Way. This orbital history likely precludes significant tidal disruption from the Galactic disk, notably unlike other satellites with comparably low velocity dispersion limits in the literature. Thus, if further velocity measurements confirm that its velocity dispersion is truly below σv ≲ 2 km s−1, Aquarius III may serve as a useful laboratory for probing galaxy formation physics in low-mass halos.

<title>Maximum Energy of Particles in Plasmas</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9916</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9916</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Particles are accelerated to very high, nonthermal energies in space, solar, and astrophysical plasma environments. In cosmic-ray physics, the Hillas limit is often used as a rough estimate (or the necessary condition) of the maximum energy of particles. This limit is based on the concepts of one-shot direct acceleration by a system-wide motional electric field, as well as stochastic and diffusive acceleration in strongly turbulent environments. However, it remains unclear how well this limit explains the actual observed maximum energies of particles. Here, we show, based on a systematic review, that the observed maximum energy of particles—those in space, solar, astrophysical, and laboratory environments—often reach the energy predicted by the Hillas limit. We also found several exceptions, such as electrons in solar flares and jet-terminal lobes of radio galaxies, as well as protons in planetary radiation belts, where deviations from this limit occur. We discuss possible causes of such deviations, and we argue in particular that there is a good chance of detecting ultra-high-energy (∼100 GeV) solar flare electrons that have not yet been detected. We anticipate that this study will facilitate further interdisciplinary discussions on the maximum energy of particles and the underlying mechanisms of particle acceleration in diverse plasma environments.

<title>The Puzzling Long GRB 191019A: Evidence for Kilonova Light</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b7b</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b7b</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
GRB 191019A was a long gamma-ray burst (GRB) lasting ~65 s and, as such, originally thought to be linked to a core-collapse supernova. However, even though follow-up observations identified the optical counterpart close to the bright nucleus of a nearby ancient galaxy (z = 0.248), no associated supernova was found. This led to the suggestion that the burst was caused by the merger of two compact stellar objects, likely in a dense circumnuclear environment. By using a recently developed diagnostic tool based on prompt emission temporal properties, we noticed that GRB 191019A falls among those long GRBs which are associated with compact mergers and with evidence of kilonova light. We thus reanalyzed unpublished GROND multicolor ( ) data obtained between 0.4 and 15 days posttrigger. Image subtraction confirmed the optical counterpart in all four optical bands, with GROND tracking its fading until 1.5 days postburst. Incorporating publicly available Swift-XRT data, a joint fit of an afterglow plus a kilonova model revealed a better match than an afterglow-only scenario. The resulting kilonova properties resemble those of AT2017gfo associated with the binary neutron star merger GW170817, with a total ejected mass of ~0.06 M⊙. Contrary to previous findings inferring a high-density circumburst environment (n0 ~ 107−8 cm−3), our analysis finds standard conditions (n0 ~ 1 cm−3), suggesting the long duration of GRB 191019A was intrinsic rather than due to jet interaction with a dense external medium.

<title>Potential Interior Structures and Habitability of Super-Earth Exoplanets LHS 1140 b, K2-18 b, TOI-1452 b, and TOI-1468 c</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We analyze four super-Earth exoplanets, LHS 1140 b, K2-18 b, TOI-1452 b, and TOI-1468 c, which orbit M dwarf stars in the habitable zone. Their relative proximity, within 40 pc, makes them prime candidates for follow-up observations and atmospheric and habitability studies. This paper aims to assess their internal structure and habitability, considering their tidal heating, atmospheric heating, and global transport. We model the interior structure of the planets by applying Bayesian inference to an exoplanet's interior model. A model with constant quality factor is used to calculate the range of tidal heating, and a one-dimensional analytical model of tidally locked planets is used to assess their surface temperature distribution and habitability. Assuming no or only thin atmospheres, K2-18 b and TOI-1468 c are likely to be water worlds. However, TOI-1452 b and LHS 1140 b may have rocky surfaces. We find that tidal heating is not enough to raise the global mean surface temperature, but greenhouse heating can effectively do so. If the considered planets have retained thick atmospheres, K2-18 b, TOI-1468 c, and TOI-1452 b may, for significant atmospheric heating and heat transport factors, be too hot to sustain liquid water on their surfaces. However, the lower instellation of LHS 1140 b and the nonzero probability of it having a rocky surface give more space for habitable conditions on the planet.

<title>Linear Bending Wave Propagation in Laminar and Turbulent Disks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Bending waves are perhaps the most fundamental and analytically tractable phenomena in warped disk dynamics. In this work, we conduct 3D grid-based, numerical experiments of bending waves in laminar, viscous hydrodynamic and turbulent, weakly magnetized disks, capturing their behavior in unprecedented detail. We clearly elucidate the theory from first principles, wherein the general Fourier–Hermite formalism can be simplified to a reduced framework which extends previous results toward locally isothermal disks. We obtain remarkable agreement with our laminar simulations wherein the tilt evolution is well described by the reduced theory, while higher-order vertical modes should be retained for capturing the detailed disk twisting and internal velocity profiles. We then relax this laminar assumption and instead launch bending waves atop a magnetorotationally turbulent disk. Although the turbulence can be quantified with an effective α parameter, the bending waves behave distinctly from a classical viscous evolution and are readily disrupted when the turbulent velocity is comparable to the induced warping flows. This may have implications for the inclination damping rates induced by planet–disk interactions, the capture rate of black holes in active galactic nucleus disks or the warped shapes assumed by disks in misaligned systems.

<title>Redshifting the Study of Cold Brown Dwarfs and Exoplanets: The Mid-infrared Wavelength Region as an Indicator of Surface Gravity and Mass</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
JWST is opening many avenues for exploration. For cold brown dwarfs and exoplanets, JWST has opened the door to the mid-infrared wavelength region, where such objects emit significant energy. For the first time, astronomers have access to mid-infrared spectroscopy for objects colder than 600 K. The first spectra appear to validate the model suite known as ATMO 2020++: atmospheres that include disequilibrium chemistry and have a nonadiabatic pressure–temperature relationship. Preliminary fits to JWST spectroscopy of Y dwarfs show that the slope of the energy distribution from λ ≈ 4.5 μm to λ ≈ 10 μm is very sensitive to gravity. We explore this phenomenon using PH3-free ATMO 2020++ models and updated Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer W2−W3 colors. We find that an absolute 4.5 μm flux measurement constrains temperature, and the ratio of the 4.5 μm flux to the 10–15 μm flux is sensitive to gravity and less sensitive to metallicity. We identify 10 T dwarfs with red W2−W3 colors that are likely to be very-low-gravity, young, few-Jupiter-mass objects; one of these is the previously known COCONUTS-2b. The unusual Y dwarf WISEPA J182831.08+265037.8 is blue in W2−W3, and we find that the 4–18 μm JWST spectrum is well reproduced if the system is a pair of high-gravity 400 K dwarfs. Recently published JWST colors and luminosity-based effective temperatures for late-T and -Y dwarfs further corroborate the ATMO 2020++ models, demonstrating the potential for significant improvement in our understanding of cold, very-low-mass bodies in the solar neighborhood.

<title>A Parameter Study of the Electromagnetic Signatures of an Analytical Mini-disk Model for Supermassive Black Hole Binary Systems</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are thought to be located at the centers of most galactic nuclei. When galaxies merge, they form SMBH binary (SMBHB) systems, and these central SMBHs will also merge at later times, producing gravitational waves. Because galaxy mergers are likely gas-rich environments, SMBHBs are also potential sources of electromagnetic (EM) radiation. The EM signatures depend on gas dynamics, orbital dynamics, and radiation processes. The gas dynamics are governed by general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in a time-dependent spacetime. Numerically solving the MHD equations for a time-dependent binary spacetime is computationally expensive. Therefore, it is challenging to conduct a full exploration of the parameter space of these systems and the resulting EM signatures. We have developed an analytical accretion-disk model for the mini-disks of an SMBHB system and produced images and light curves using a general-relativistic ray-tracing code and a superimposed harmonic binary BH metric. This analytical model greatly reduces the time and computational resources needed to explore these systems, while incorporating some key information from simulations. We present a parameter-space exploration of the SMBHB system, in which we study the dependence of the EM signatures on the spins of the BHs, the mass ratio, the accretion rate, the viewing angle, and the initial binary separation. Additionally, we study how the commonly used fast-light approximation affects the EM signatures and evaluate its validity in general-relativistic MHD simulations.

<title>Numerical Simulation of Electron Magnetohydrodynamics with Landau-quantized Electrons in Magnetar Crusts</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9dea</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9dea</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In magnetar crusts, magnetic fields are sufficiently strong to confine electrons into a small to moderate number of quantized Landau levels. This can have a dramatic effect on the crust's thermodynamic properties, generating field-dependent de Haas–van Alphen oscillations. We previously argued that the large-amplitude oscillations of the magnetic susceptibility could enhance the ohmic dissipation of the magnetic field by continuously generating small-scale, rapidly dissipating field features. This could be important to magnetar field evolution and contribute to their observed higher temperatures. To study this, we performed quasi-3D numerical simulations of electron MHD in a representative volume of neutron star crust matter, for the first time including the magnetization and magnetic susceptibility resulting from Landau quantization. We find that the potential enhancement in the ohmic dissipation rate due to this effect can be a factor ∼3 for temperatures of the order of 108 K, and ∼4.5 for temperatures of the order of 5 × 107 K, depending on the magnetic field configuration. The nonlinear Hall term is crucial to this amplification: without it, the magnetic field decay is only enhanced by a factor ≲2 even at 5 × 107 K. These effects generate a high wavenumber plateau in the magnetic energy spectrum associated with the small-scale de Haas–van Alphen oscillations. Our results suggest that this mechanism could help explain the magnetar heating problem, though due to the effect's temperature-dependence, full magneto-thermal evolution simulations in a realistic stellar model are needed to judge whether it is viable explanation.

<title>Evolution of Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence in the Expanding Solar Wind: Residual Energy and Intermittency</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We conduct 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of decaying turbulence in the context of the solar wind. To account for the spherical expansion of the solar wind, we implement the expanding box model. The initial turbulence comprises uncorrelated counterpropagating Alfvén waves and exhibits an isotropic power spectrum. Our findings reveal the consistent generation of negative residual energy whenever nonlinear interactions are present, independent of the normalized cross helicity σc and compressibility. The spherical expansion facilitates this process. The resulting residual energy is primarily distributed in the perpendicular direction, with S2(b) − S2(u) ∝ l⊥ or equivalently . Here S2(b) and S2(u) are second-order structure functions of magnetic field and velocity respectively. In most runs, S2(b) develops a scaling relation ( ). In contrast, S2(u) is consistently shallower than S2(b), which aligns with in situ observations of the solar wind. We observe that the higher-order statistics of the turbulence, which act as a proxy for intermittency, depend on the initial σc and are strongly affected by the expansion effect. Generally, the intermittency is more pronounced when the expansion effect is present. Finally, we find that in our simulations, although the negative residual energy and intermittency grow simultaneously as the turbulence evolves, the causal relation between them seems to be weak, possibly because they are generated on different scales.

<title>Phase-transition-induced Collapse of Proto-compact Stars and Its Implication for Supernova Explosions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A hadron–quark phase transition (PT) may trigger supernova explosions during stellar core collapse. However, both success and failure have occurred in previous attempts to explode dying stars via this mechanism. We systematically explore the outcomes of the PT-induced collapse of mock proto-compact stars (PCSs) with a constant entropy and lepton fraction, with spherically symmetric general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations and a controlled series of hybrid equations of state. Our results reveal the qualitative dependence of successful and failed explosions on the PT and quark matter characteristics. A small portion (∼0.04%−1%) of the released binding energy ΔEB transforms into the diagnostic explosion energy Eexp,diag, which saturates at ∼6 × 1051 erg near the black hole formation. Note that our Eexp,diag represents an upper limit of the final explosion energies in realistic supernova simulations. We draw the phase diagrams indicative of the possible fates of supernova explosions driven by hadron−quark PTs, where the control parameters are the onset density, the energy gap of the PT, and the quark matter speed of sound. Our findings can guide further self-consistent investigations on PT-driven core-collapse supernovae and help identify hadron−quark PT-induced PCS collapse from future observations.

<title>Cosmic Reionization on Computers: The Evolution of the Ionizing Background and Mean Free Path</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada1d3</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada1d3</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Observations of the end stages of reionization indicate that at z ≈ 5–6, the ionizing background is not uniform and the mean free path (MFP) changes drastically. As the MFP is closely related to the distribution of Lyman-limit systems (LLSs) and damped Lyα absorbers, it is important to understand them. In this study, we utilize the Cosmic Reionization on Computers (CROC) simulations, which have both sufficient spatial resolution to resolve galaxy formation and LLSs alongside a fully coupled radiative transfer, to simulate the reionization processes. We analyze two CROC boxes with distinct reionization histories and find that the distributions of the ionizing background in both simulations display significant skewness. Further, the ionizing background in the late-reionization box still displays significant fluctuations (∼40%) at z ≈ 5. We also measure the MFP along sightlines that center on potential quasar hosting halos. The evolution of the MFP measured from these sightlines exhibits a break that coincides with the disappearance of all the neutral islands in the reionization history of each box. In the absence of LLSs, the MFP will be biased high by ≈20% at z ≈ 5. We also compare the MFPs measured in random sightlines. We find that at z ≈ 5, the MFPs measured in sightlines that start from massive halos are systematically smaller by ≈10% compared with the MFPs measured in random sightlines. We attribute this difference to the concentration of dense structures within 1 pMpc of massive halos. Our findings highlight the importance of high-fidelity models in the interpretation of observational measurements.

Collision-induced spectra are essential for radiative transfer modeling of Titan's atmosphere. We present experimental spectra of nitrogen–methane mixtures with an accompanying fit of N2-CH4 collision-induced absorption in the 30–400 cm−1 region at about 130 K. We found a peak absorption of 2.30 × 10−5 cm−1 amagat−2 at 75 cm−1 and a secondary peak of 1.35 × 10−5 cm−1 amagat−2 at 206.5 cm−1, which agrees with previous studies. Our work does not support the suggestion that N2-CH4 CIA in the far-infrared should be increased by about 50%, as suggested by spectroscopic modeling of Titan using data from A. Borysow & C. Tang.

<title>Optical Quasiperiodic Oscillations with 550 Day Periodicity in the Reverberation-mapped Broad Line Quasar PG 1411+442</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada284</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this paper, optical quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) with 550 day periodicity related to a candidate subparsec binary black hole (BBH) system are reported in the reverberation-mapped broad line quasar PG 1411+442 but with a different line profile of broad Hα from that of broad Hβ in its rms spectrum. First, considering the sine function to describe the 18.8 yr long light curves from the Catalina Sky Survey, All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, and Zwicky Transient Facility, 550 day periodicity can be confirmed with a confidence level higher than 5σ. Second, the stable 550 day optical QPOs can be reconfirmed with confidence levels higher than 5σ by the generalized Lomb–Scargle periodogram, the sine-like phase-folded light curves, and the weighted wavelet z-transform technique determined power maps. Third, based on simulated light curves by the continuous autoregressive process, a confidence level higher than 3.5σ can be confirmed for the optical QPOs not related to intrinsic active galactic nucleus (AGN) variability. Moreover, considering the spatial separation of central two black hole (BH) accreting systems with smaller than expected sizes of broad emission line regions, a central total BH mass higher than 106 M⊙ could lead to few effects of supposed BBH systems on estimated virial BH masses. Meanwhile, disk precession is not preferred due to the similar estimated sizes of the optical and near-ultraviolet emission regions, and jet precession can be ruled out due to PG 1411+442 being a radio-quiet quasar. The results strongly indicate it would be practicable, by applying very different line profiles of broad Balmer emission lines, to detect candidate BBH systems in normal broad line AGN in the near future.

<title>Modeling the Magnetic Connection from Earth to Solar Corona during the May 11 Geomagnetic Superstorm</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In early 2024 May, the solar active region AR 13664 released a series of X-class solar flares and multiple coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that resulted in the strongest geomagnetic storm of the last 20 yr. This study aims at improving our understanding of the magnetic connectivity between Earth and the solar corona by reconstructing the magnetic footpoint of the Earth on the solar surface during this geomagnetic superstorm. A Monte Carlo simulation was applied to model the random walk of interplanetary magnetic field lines due to low-frequency turbulence in the solar wind. This model uses local diffusion coefficients dependent on magnetic fluctuations and the correlation length of solar wind turbulence. The simulation revealed an enhanced diffusion of magnetic field lines due to the passage of CMEs, leading to a broader area of solar surface magnetically connected to Earth, particularly near AR 13664. This proximity facilitated the rapid propagation of solar energetic protons, increasing fluxes observed at L1. The findings have significant implications for predicting space weather effects on Earth and other solar system bodies, contributing to the development of more accurate models for future space exploration missions. Since the Parker spiral reconstruction is consistent with the Magnetic Connectivity Tool, validating the model's reliability, it shows promise for reconstructing magnetic connections for potential real-time purposes.

<title>SIRI-2 Detection of the Gamma-Ray Burst 221009A</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
SIRI-2 is a collection of strontium iodide gamma-ray detectors sensitive at approximately 400 keV to 10 MeV, launched on the Department of Defense's STPSat-6 to geosynchronous orbit. SIRI-2 detected the gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A and, unlike most GRB detectors, was not saturated and did not require any pulse pileup corrections. The energetics of this burst as measured by SIRI-2 are consistent with those found by other instruments, and the Band function fits to the spectra are consistent with those from the unsaturated Insight and GECAM instruments and similar to corrected spectra from the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor, but softer than those found by Konus-Wind when that instrument was saturated. The total fluence measured with SIRI-2 was measured to be 0.140 ± 0.002 erg cm−2, lower than other instruments, likely due to the increasing background of SIRI-2 forcing the calculation to use a smaller time interval. An extrapolation of the distributions of fluences from GRBs to the fluence of 221009A measured with SIRI-2 indicates bursts brighter than this one should occur about once every 4000 yr.

<title>Physics-driven Explosions of Stripped High-mass Stars: Synthetic Light Curves and Spectra of Stripped-envelope Supernovae with Broad Light Curves</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada26d</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) represent a significant fraction of core-collapse supernovae, arising from massive stars that have shed their hydrogen and, in some cases, helium envelopes. The origins and explosion mechanisms of SESNe remain a topic of active investigation. In this work, we employ radiative-transfer simulations to model the light curves and spectra of a set of explosions of single, solar-metallicity, massive Wolf–Rayet stars with ejecta masses ranging from 4 to 11 M⊙, which were computed from a turbulence-aided and neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. We analyze these synthetic observables to explore the impact of varying ejecta mass and helium content on observable features. We find that the light curve shape of these progenitors with high ejecta masses is consistent with observed SESNe with broad light curves but not the peak luminosities. The commonly used analytic formula based on rising bolometric light curves overestimates the ejecta mass of these high-initial-mass progenitor explosions by a factor of up to 2.6. In contrast, the calibrated method by Haynie et al., which relies on late-time decay tails, reduces uncertainties to an average of 20% within the calibrated ejecta mass range. Spectroscopically, the He i 1.083 μm line remains prominent even in models with as little as 0.02 M⊙ of helium. However, the strength of the optical He i lines is not directly proportional to the helium mass but instead depends on a complex interplay of factors such as the 56Ni distribution, composition, and radiation field. Thus, producing realistic helium features requires detailed radiative transfer simulations for each new hydrodynamic model.

<title>The PANORAMIC Survey: Pure Parallel Wide Area Legacy Imaging with JWST/NIRCam</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the PANORAMIC survey, a pure parallel extragalactic imaging program with JWST/NIRCam observed during Cycle 1. The survey obtained ∼530 square arcmin of NIRCam imaging from 1–5 μm, totaling ∼192 hr of science integration time. This represents the largest on-sky time investment of any Cycle 1 GO extragalactic NIRCam imaging program by nearly a factor of 2. The survey includes ∼432 square arcmin of novel sky area not yet observed with JWST using at least six NIRCam broadband filters, increasing the existing area covered by similar Cycle 1 data by ∼60%. Additionally, 70 square arcmin was also covered by a seventh filter (F410M). A fraction of PANORAMIC data (∼200 square arcmin) was obtained in or around extragalactic deep fields, enhancing their legacy value. Pure parallel observing naturally creates a “wedding cake” survey with both wide and ultra-deep tiers, with 5σ point-source depths at F444W ranging from 27.8–29.4 (ABmag), and with minimized cosmic variance. The ≳6-filter strategy yields remarkably good photometric redshift performance, achieving similar median scatter and outlier fraction as CANDELS (σNMAD ∼ 0.07; η ∼ 0.2), enabling a wealth of science across redshift without need for follow-up or ancillary data. We overview the proposed survey, the data obtained as part of this program, and document the science-ready data products in the data release. PANORAMIC has delivered wide-area and deep imaging with excellent photometric performance, demonstrating that pure parallel observations with JWST are a highly efficient observing mode that is key to acquiring a complete picture of galaxy evolution from rare bright galaxies to fainter, more abundant sources across redshifts.

<title>What Does the LMC Look Like? It Depends on [M/H] and Age</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b17</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b17</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We offer a new way to look at the LMC through stellar mono-abundance and mono-age mono-abundance maps. These maps are based on ≳500,000 member stars with estimates of [M/H] (σ[M/H] ~ 0.17) and age ), derived from Gaia Data Release 3 XP spectra and photometry, which are tied to and validated against APOGEE. This results in the first area-complete, metallicity- and age-differentiated stellar maps of any disk galaxy. Azimuthally averaged, these maps reveal a surprisingly simple picture of the Milky Way's largest satellite galaxy. For any [M/H] below −0.1 dex, the LMC's radial profile is well described by a simple exponential, but with a scale length that steadily shrinks toward higher metallicities, from nearly 2.3 kpc at [M/H] = −1.8 to only 0.75 kpc at [M/H] = −0.25, as fit by forward modeling the spatial distribution of mono-[M/H] populations. The prominence of the bar decreases dramatically with [M/H], making it barely discernible at [M/H] ≲ −1.5. Yet, even for metal-rich populations, the bar has little impact on the azimuthally averaged profile of the mono-abundance components. Including ages, we find that the scale length is a greater function of age than of metallicity, with younger populations far more centrally concentrated. Only at old ages does the scale length change, specifically decrease, with increasing metallicity. These findings provide quantitative support for a scenario in which the LMC built its stellar structure effectively outside-in.

<title>On the Formation of Planets in the Milky Way’s Thick Disk</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9aa1</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Exoplanet demographic surveys have revealed that close-in (≲1 au) small planets orbiting stars in the Milky Way’s thick disk are ∼50% less abundant than those orbiting stars in the Galactic thin disk. One key difference between the two stellar populations is the time at which they emerged: thick-disk stars are the likely product of cosmic noon (redshift z ∼ 2), an era characterized by high star formation rate, massive and dense molecular clouds, and strong supersonic turbulence. Solving for the background radiation field in these early star-forming regions, we demonstrate that protoplanetary disks at cosmic noon experienced radiation fields up to ∼7 orders of magnitude more intense than in solar neighborhood conditions. Coupling the radiation field to a one-dimensional protoplanetary disk evolution model, we find that external UV photoevaporation destroys protoplanetary disks in just ∼0.2–0.5 Myr, limiting the timescale over which planets can assemble. Disk temperatures exceed the sublimation temperatures of common volatile species for ≳Myr timescales, predicting more spatial homogeneity in gas chemical composition. Our calculations imply that the deficit in planet occurrence around thick-disk stars should be even more pronounced for giant planets, particularly those at wide orbital separations, predicting a higher rocky-to-giant planet ratio in the Galactic thick disk versus thin disk.

The cores of pulsars are expected to become superconducting soon after birth. The transition to type-II superconductivity is associated with the bunching of magnetic field lines into discrete superconducting flux tubes which possess enormous tension. The coupling of the crust to the flux tubes implies the existence of huge tangential magnetic fields at the crust–core interface. We show that the transition to superconductivity triggers a highly nonlinear response in the Hall drift of the crustal magnetic field, an effect which was neglected in previous numerical modeling. We argue that at the time of the phase transition giant Hall waves are launched from the crust–core interface toward the surface. Our models show that if the crust contains a multipolar magnetic field ∼1013 G, the amplitude of the Hall waves is ∼1015 G. The elastic deformation of the lattice is included in our models, which allows us to track the time-dependent shear stresses everywhere in the crust. The simulations indicate that the Hall waves may be strong enough to break the crust, and could cause star quakes which trigger rotation glitches and changes in the radio pulse profile. The Hall waves also couple to slow magnetospheric changes, which cause anomalous braking indices. The emission of the giant Hall waves from the crust–core interface facilitates fast flux expulsion from the superconducting core, provided that the flux tubes in the core are themselves sufficiently mobile. For all of the flux tube mobility prescriptions implemented in this work, the core approaches the Meissner state with B = 0 at late times.

<title>Unveiling Low-frequency Eclipses in Spider Millisecond Pulsars Using Wideband GMRT Observations</title>

Eclipses of radio emission have been reported for ∼58 spider millisecond pulsars (MSPs), of which only around 19% have been extensively studied. Such studies at low frequencies are crucial for probing the properties of the eclipse medium. This study investigates eclipses in 10 MSPs in compact orbit using wide-bandwidth observations with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. We report the first evidence of eclipsing for PSR J2234+0944 and J2214+3000 in one epoch, while no evidence of eclipsing was observed in the subsequent two epochs, indicating temporal evolution of the eclipse cutoff frequency in these systems. Constraints on the eclipse cutoff frequency were obtained for PSR J1555–2908, J1810+1744, and J2051–0827. Moreover, for the first time, we detected an eclipse at a nonstandard orbital phase (∼0.5) for PSR J1810+1744, with a duration longer than the eclipse observed at superior conjunction. No eclipses were detected for PSR J0751+1807, J1738+0333, and J1807–2459A at 300–500 MHz and 550–750 MHz. We calculated the mass-loss rate of the companion for PSR J1555–2908 and PSR J1810+1744 and found that these rates are insufficient to ablate the companion stars. We cataloged the , mass function, Roche lobe filling factor, and inclination angle for compact MSP binaries with low-mass companions and found that higher spin-down flux does not guarantee eclipses. Our analysis, supported by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic, confirms that eclipsing black widow binaries generally exhibit a higher mass function compared to noneclipsing black widow binaries, consistent with previous studies.

<title>Peculiar Dust Emission within the Orion Molecular Cloud</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad93c7</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
It is widely assumed that dust opacities in molecular clouds follow a power-law profile with an index, β. Recent studies of the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC) 2/3 complex, however, show a flattening in the spectral energy distribution (SED) at λ > 2 mm, implying nonconstant indices on scales ≳0.08 pc. The origin of this flattening is not yet known, but it may be due to the intrinsic properties of the dust grains or contamination from other sources of emission. We investigate the SED slopes in OMC 2/3 further using observations of six protostellar cores with Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) from 2.9–3.6 mm and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Atacama Compact Array in Band 4 (1.9–2.1 mm) and Band 5 (1.6–1.8 mm) on core and envelope scales of ∼0.02–0.08 pc. We confirm flattened opacity indices between 2.9 mm and 3.6 mm for the six cores with β ≈ −0.16 to 1.45, which are notably lower than the β-values of >1.3 measured for these sources on 0.08 pc scales from single-dish data. Four sources have consistent SED slopes between the ALMA data and the NOEMA data. We propose that these sources may have a significant fraction of emission coming from large dust grains in embedded disks, which biases the emission more at longer wavelengths. Two sources, however, had inconsistent slopes between the ALMA and NOEMA data, indicating different origins of emission. These results highlight how care is needed when combining multiscale observations or extrapolating single-band observations to other wavelengths.

<title>Detecting Stellar Flares in Photometric Data Using Hidden Markov Models</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad95f6</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad95f6</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a hidden Markov model (HMM) for discovering stellar flares in light-curve data of stars. HMMs provide a framework to model time series data that are nonstationary; they allow for systems to be in different states at different times and consider the probabilities that describe the switching dynamics between states. In the context of the discovery of stellar flares, we exploit the HMM framework by allowing the light curve of a star to be in one of three states at any given time step: quiet, firing, or decaying. This three-state HMM formulation is designed to enable straightforward identification of stellar flares, their duration, and associated uncertainty. This is crucial for estimating the flare's energy, and is useful for studies of stellar flare energy distributions. We combine our HMM with a celerite model that accounts for quasiperiodic stellar oscillations. Through an injection recovery experiment, we demonstrate and evaluate the ability of our method to detect and characterize flares in stellar time series. We also show that the proposed HMM flags fainter and lower energy flares more easily than traditional sigma-clipping methods. Lastly, we visually demonstrate that simultaneously conducting detrending and flare detection can mitigate biased estimations arising in multistage modeling approaches. Thus, this method paves a new way to calculate stellar flare energy. We conclude with an example application to one star observed by TESS, showing how the HMM compares with sigma clipping when using real data.

<title>What Can DKIST/DL-NIRSP Tell Us about Quiet-Sun Magnetism?</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad98e7</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Quiet-Sun regions cover most of the Sun's surface; their magnetic fields contribute significantly to solar chromospheric and coronal heating. However, characterizing the magnetic fields of the quiet Sun is challenging due to their weak polarization signal. The 4 m Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) is expected to improve our understanding of quiet-Sun magnetism. In this paper, we assess the diagnostic capability of the Diffraction Limited Near Infrared Spectropolarimeter (DL-NIRSP) instrument on DKIST for the energy transport processes in the quiet-Sun photosphere. To this end, we synthesize high-resolution, high-cadence Stokes profiles of the Fe i 630 nm lines using a realistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation, degrade them to emulate the DKIST/DL-NIRSP observations, and subsequently infer the vector magnetic and velocity fields. For the assessment, we first verify that a widely used flow tracking algorithm, the Differential Affine Velocity Estimator for Vector Magnetograms, works well for estimating the large-scale (>200 km) photospheric velocity fields with these high-resolution data. We then examine how the accuracy of the inferred velocity depends on the temporal resolution. Finally, we investigate the reliability of the Poynting flux estimate and its dependence on the model assumptions. The results suggest that the unsigned Poynting flux, estimated with existing schemes, can account for about 71.4% and 52.6% of the reference ground truth at and . However, the net Poynting flux tends to be significantly underestimated. The error mainly arises from the underestimated contribution of the horizontal motion. We discuss the implications for DKIST observations.

<title>An Investigation into the Selection and Colors of Little Red Dots and Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9920</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9920</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recently, a large number of compact sources at z > 4 with blue UV slopes and extremely red rest-frame optical slopes have been found in James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) extragalactic surveys. As a subsample of these sources, commonly called “little red dots” (LRDs), have been spectroscopically observed to host a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN), they have been the focus of multiple recent studies in an attempt to understand the origin of their UV and optical emission. Here, we assemble a sample of 123 LRDs from the literature along with spectroscopic and photometric JWST-identified samples of AGNs to compare their colors and spectral slopes. We find that while obscured AGNs at z < 6 have highly dissimilar colors to LRDs, unobscured AGNs at z < 6 span a wide range of colors, with only a subsample showing colors similar to LRDs. At z > 6, the majority of the unobscured AGNs that have been found in these samples are LRDs, but this may be related to the fact that these sources are at large bolometric luminosities. Because LRDs occupy a unique position in galaxy color space, they are more straightforward to target, and the large number of broad-line AGNs that do not have LRD colors and slopes are therefore underrepresented in many spectroscopic surveys because they are more difficult to preselect. Current LRD selection techniques return a large and disparate population, including many sources having 2–5 μm colors impacted by emission-line flux boosting in individual filters.

<title>Potential Technosignature from Anomalously Low Deuterium/Hydrogen in Planetary Water Depleted by Nuclear Fusion Technology</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Deuterium–deuterium (DD) fusion is viewed as an ideal energy source for humanity in the far future, given a vast seawater supply of D. Here, we consider long-lived, extraterrestrial, technological societies that develop DD fusion. If such a society persisted over geologic timescales, oceanic deuterium would diminish. For an ocean mass and initial deuterium/hydrogen (D/H) ratio that were Earth-like, fusion power use of only ∼10 times that projected for humankind next century would deplete the D/H ratio in ∼(a few) ×108 yr to values below that of the local interstellar medium (ISM). Ocean masses of a few percent of Earth’s would reach an anomalously low D/H in ∼106–107 yr. The timescale shortens with greater energy consumption, smaller oceans, or lower initial D/H. Here, we suggest that anomalous D/H in planetary water below local ISM values of ∼16 × 10−6 (set by Big Bang nucleosynthesis plus deuterium loss onto dust or small admixtures of deuterium-poor stellar material) may be a technosignature. Unlike SETI using radio signals, anomalous D/H would persist for eons, even if civilizations perished or relocated. We discuss the wavelengths of strong absorption features for detecting D/H anomalies in atmospheric water vapor. These are vibrational O–D stretching at 3.7 μm in transmission spectroscopy of Earth-like worlds, ∼1.5 μm (in the wings of the 1.4 μm water band) in the shorter near-infrared for direct imaging by the Habitable Worlds Observatory, and ∼7.5-8 μm (in the wings of the broad 6.3 μm bending vibration of water) for concepts like the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The cosmic X-ray background (CXB) is dominated by the obscured and unobscured coronal light of active galactic nuclei (AGN). At energies below 10 keV, the CXB can be well explained by models taking into account the known AGN and the observed distribution of their obscuring, line-of-sight column densities, NH,l.o.s. However, at energies around the Compton reflection hump (~30 keV), the models fall short of the data. This suggests the existence of a population of as yet undetected Compton-thick (CT) AGN (NH,l.o.s > 1.5 × 1024 cm−2) whose X-ray spectra are dominated by the light that has been reprocessed by the obscuring material. In this work, we continue the effort to find and catalog all local (z < 0.05) CT AGN. To this end, we obtained soft X-ray data with Chandra for six local BAT detected sources lacking ROSAT (0.1–2.4 keV) counterparts, indicating potential obscuration. We fit their spectra with Bayesian and least squares methods using two different models, borus02 and UXCLUMPY. We compare the results of the different models and methods and find that the NH,l.o.s is consistently measured in each case. Three of the sources were also observed with XMM-Newton, allowing the opportunity to search for variability in soft X-ray flux or NH,l.o.s. From this sample, we find one strong CT candidate (NGC 5759) and one weaker CT candidate (CGCG 1822.3+2053). Furthermore, we find tentative evidence of NH,l.o.s variability in 2MASX J17253053–4510279, which has NH,l.o.s < 1022 cm−2.

<title>Testing the Breakdown of the Asteroseismic Scaling Relations in Luminous Red Giants</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b18</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Nearly all cool, evolved stars are solar-like oscillators, and fundamental stellar properties can be inferred from these oscillations with asteroseismology. Scaling relations are commonly used to relate global asteroseismic properties—the frequency of maximum power and the large-frequency separation Δν—to stellar properties. Mass, radius, and age can then be inferred with the addition of stellar spectroscopy. There is excellent agreement between seismic radii and fundamental data on the lower red giant branch and red clump. However, the scaling relations appear to breakdown in luminous red-giant stars. We attempt to constrain the contributions of the asteroseismic parameters to the observed breakdown. We test the and Δν scaling relations separately, by using stars of known mass and radius in star clusters and the Milky Way's high-α sequence. We find evidence that the Δν scaling relation contributes to the observed breakdown in luminous giants more than the relation. We test different methods of mapping the observed Δν to the mean density via a correction factor, FΔν, and find a ≈ 1%–3% difference in the radii in the luminous giant regime, depending on the technique used to measure FΔν. The differences between the radii inferred by these two techniques are too small on the luminous giant branch to account for the inflated seismic radii observed in evolved giant stars. Finally, we find that the FΔν correction is insensitive to the adopted mixing length, chosen by calibrating the models to observations of Teff .

<title>Can Active Galactic Nuclei Activity Be Enhanced by Ram Pressure Stripping?—X-Ray Perspective</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b7f</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b7f</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Ram pressure stripping (RPS) is an important process that plays a significant role in shaping the evolution of cluster galaxies and their surrounding environment. Despite its recognized significance, the potential connection between RPS and active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity in cluster galaxies remains poorly understood. Recent claims, based on optical emission-line diagnostics, have suggested such a connection. Here, we investigate this relationship from an X-ray perspective, using a sample of galaxies undergoing RPS in four nearby galaxy clusters: A1656, A1367, A426, and A3627. This study is the first to test such a connection from an X-ray standpoint. Our analysis reveals no signs of enhanced X-ray AGN activity in our sample, with most RPS galaxies (~90%) showing X-ray luminosities below 1041 erg s−1 in their central point sources. Moreover, there is no noticeable difference in X-ray AGN activity among RPS galaxies compared to a control sample of non-RPS galaxies, as demonstrated by the similar X-ray luminosities observed in their central point sources. While the most luminous X-ray AGN in our sample is found in ESO 137-002, a galaxy undergoing RPS in A3627, there is no evidence for a widespread enhancement of X-ray AGN activity due to RPS. Given the limited sample size of our study, this could also indicate that either the X-ray AGN enhancement from RPS is at most weak or the timescale for the X-ray AGN enhancement is short. This emphasizes the need for further investigations with larger X-ray samples to better understand the impact of RPS on AGN activity in cluster galaxies.

<title>Tides on Lava Worlds: Application to Close-in Exoplanets and the Early Earth–Moon System</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Understanding the physics of planetary magma oceans has been the subject of growing efforts, in light of the increasing abundance of solar system samples and extrasolar surveys. A rocky planet harboring such an ocean is likely to interact tidally with its host star, planetary companions, or satellites. To date, however, models of the tidal response and heat generation of magma oceans have been restricted to the framework of weakly viscous solids, ignoring the dynamical fluid behavior of the ocean beyond a critical melt fraction. Here we provide a handy analytical model that accommodates this phase transition, allowing for a physical estimation of the tidal response of lava worlds. We apply the model in two settings: the tidal history of the early Earth–Moon system in the aftermath of the giant impact, and the tidal interplay between short-period exoplanets and their host stars. For the former, we show that the fluid behavior of the Earth's molten surface drives efficient early lunar recession to ~25 Earth radii within 104–105 yr, in contrast with earlier predictions. For close-in exoplanets, we report on how their molten surfaces significantly change their spin–orbit dynamics, allowing them to evade spin–orbit resonances and accelerating their track toward tidal synchronization from a gigayear to megayear timescale. Moreover, we reevaluate the energy budgets of detected close-in exoplanets, highlighting how the surface thermodynamics of these planets are likely controlled by enhanced, fluid-driven tidal heating, rather than vigorous insolation, and how this regime change substantially alters predictions for their surface temperatures.

<title>Finding Lensed Radio Sources with the Very Large Array Sky Survey</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Radio observations of strongly lensed objects are valuable as cosmological probes. Lensed radio sources have proven difficult to identify, in large part due to the limited depth and angular resolution of the previous generation of radio sky surveys, and, as such, only a few dozen lensed radio sources are known. In this work, we present the results of a pilot study, using the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) in combination with optical data to more efficiently identify lensed radio sources. We obtain high-resolution (0 2) VLA follow-up observations for 11 targets that we identify using three different techniques: (i) a search for compact radio sources offset from galaxies with high lensing potential, (ii) VLASS detections of known lensed galaxies, and (iii) VLASS detections of known lensed quasars. Five of our targets show radio emission from the lensed images, including 100% of the lensed optical quasar systems. This work demonstrates the efficacy of combining deep- and high-resolution wide-area radio and optical survey data to efficiently find lensed radio sources, and we discuss the potential impact of such an approach using next-generation surveys with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, Euclid, and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

<title>Reverberation Mapping of Two Variable Active Galactic Nuclei: Probing the Distinct Characteristics of the Inner and Outer Broad-line Regions</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9c71</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Current reverberation mapping (RM) studies primarily focus on single emission lines, particularly the Hβ line, which may not fully reveal the geometry and kinematic properties of the broad-line region (BLR). To overcome this limitation, we have conducted multiline RM observations on two highly variable active galactic nuclei (AGNs), KUG 1141+371 and UGC 3374, using the Lijiang 2.4 m telescope. Our goal was to investigate the detailed structures of different regions within the BLR. We measured the time lags of multiple broad emission lines (Hα, Hβ, Hγ, He i, and He ii) and found clear evidence of radial ionization stratification in the BLRs of both AGNs. Velocity-resolved RM analysis revealed distinct geometry and kinematics between the inner and outer regions of the BLRs. Assuming that the velocity-resolved lags reflect the kinematics of the BLR, our observations indicate that: (1) in KUG 1141+371, the inner BLR exhibits outflow signatures, while the outer region is consistent with virialized motion; and (2) in UGC 3374, the inner region displays virial motion, while the outer region shows inflow. Furthermore, we detected “breathing” behavior in the outer BLR regions of both AGNs, while the inner BLR regions show “anti-breathing,” which may be linked to intrinsic BLR properties. We discuss these findings in the context of various BLR formation models, highlighting the importance of long-term, multiline RM campaigns in understanding of BLR structure and evolution. Additionally, our results suggest that the observed stratification in BLR geometry and kinematics may contribute to the scatter in black hole mass estimates and the rapid changes in velocity-resolved RM signatures reported in recent studies.

<title>Figuring Out Gas and Galaxies In Enzo (FOGGIE). VIII. Complex and Stochastic Metallicity Gradients at z > 2</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Gas-phase metallicity gradients are a crucial element in understanding the chemical evolution of galaxies. We use the FOGGIE simulations to study the metallicity gradients (∇Z) of six Milky Way–like galaxies throughout their evolution. FOGGIE galaxies generally exhibit steep negative gradients for most of their history, with only a few short-lived instances reaching positive slopes that appear to arise mainly from interactions with other galaxies. FOGGIE concurs with other simulation results but disagrees with the robust observational finding that flat and positive gradients are common at z > 1. By tracking the metallicity gradient at a rapid cadence of simulation outputs (∼5–10 Myr), we find that theoretical gradients are highly stochastic: the FOGGIE galaxies spend ∼30%–50% of their time far away from a smoothed trajectory inferred from analytic models or other, less high-cadence simulations. This rapid variation makes instantaneous gradients from observations more difficult to interpret in terms of physical processes. Because of these geometric and stochastic complications, we explore nonparametric methods of quantifying the evolving metallicity distribution at z > 1. We investigate how efficiently nonparametric measures of the 2D metallicity distribution respond to metal production and mixing. Our results suggest that new methods of quantifying and interpreting gas-phase metallicity will be needed to relate trends in upcoming high-z James Webb Space Telescope observations with the underlying physics of gas accretion, expulsion, and recycling in early galaxies.

<title>Simulations of Eccentricity Growth in Compact Binary Accretion Disks with Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9ddb</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9ddb</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the results of four magnetohydrodynamic simulations and one alpha-disk simulation of accretion disks in a compact binary system, neglecting vertical stratification and assuming a locally isothermal equation of state. We demonstrate that in the presence of a net vertical field, disks that extend out to the 3:1 mean-motion resonance grow eccentricity in full MHD in much the same way as in hydrodynamical disks. Hence, turbulence due to the magnetorotational instability (MRI) does not impede the tidally driven growth of eccentricity in any meaningful way. However, we find two important differences with alpha-disk theory. First, in MHD, eccentricity builds up in the inner disk with a series of episodes of radial disk-breaking into two misaligned eccentric disks, separated by a region of circular orbits. Standing eccentric waves are often present in the inner eccentric disk. Second, the successful spreading of an accretion disk with MRI turbulence out to the resonant radius is nontrivial—and much harder than spreading an alpha disk. This is due to the tendency to develop overdense rings in which tidal torques overwhelm MRI transport and truncate the disk too early. We believe that the inability to spread the disk sufficiently was the reason why our previous attempt to excite eccentricity via the 3:1 mean-motion resonance with MHD failed. Exactly how MHD disks successfully spread outward in compact binary systems is an important problem that has not yet been understood.

<title>Physical Pathways for JWST-observed Supermassive Black Holes in the Early Universe</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9f3a</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed active galactic nuclei (AGN) powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with estimated masses of 107–108M⊙ at redshifts z ∼ 7–9. Some reside in overmassive systems with higher AGN to stellar mass ratios than locally. Understanding how massive black holes could form so early in cosmic history and affect their environment to establish the observed relations today are some of the major open questions in astrophysics and cosmology. One model to create these massive objects is through direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) that provide massive seeds (∼105–106M⊙), able to reach high masses in the limited time available. We use the cosmological simulation code GIZMO to study the formation and growth of DCBH seeds in the early Universe. To grow the DCBHs, we implement a gas swallowing model set to match the Eddington accretion rate as long as the nearby gaseous environment, affected by stellar and accretion disk feedback, provides sufficient fuel. We find that to create massive AGN in overmassive systems at high redshifts, massive seeds accreting more efficiently than the fiducial Bondi–Hoyle model are needed. We assess whether the conditions for such enhanced accretion rates are realistic by considering limits on plausible transport mechanisms. We also examine various DCBH growth histories and find that mass growth is more sustained in overdense cosmological environments, where high gas densities are achieved locally. We discuss the exciting prospect to directly probe the assembly history of the first SMBHs with upcoming, ultradeep JWST surveys.

<title>Radial-dependent Responsivity of Broad-line Regions in Active Galactic Nuclei: Observational Consequences for Reverberation Mapping and Black Hole Mass Measurements</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The reverberation mapping (RM) technique has seen wide applications in probing geometry and kinematics of broad-line regions (BLRs) and measuring masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in active galactic nuclei. However, key quantities in RM analysis such as emissivity, responsivity, transfer functions, and mean and rms spectra are fragmentally defined in the literature and largely lack a unified formulation. Here we establish a rigorous framework for BLR RM and include a locally dependent responsivity according to photoionization calculations. The mean and rms spectra are analytically expressed with emissivity- and responsivity-weighted transfer functions, respectively. We demonstrate that the rms spectrum is proportional to the responsivity-weighted transfer function only when the continuum variation timescale is much longer than the typical extension in time delay of the BLR; otherwise, biases arise in the obtained rms line widths. The long-standing phenomenon pertaining to the different shapes between the mean and rms spectra can be explained by a radial-increasing responsivity of BLRs. The debate on the choice of emission-line widths for SMBH mass measurements is explored, and the virial factors are suggested to also depend on the luminosity states, in addition to the geometry and kinematics of BLRs.

<title>Exploring Variation of Double-peak Broad-line Profile in Strongly Variable AGNs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The geometry and kinematics of the broad-line region (BLR) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are still unclear, which is crucial for studying the physics and evolution of supermassive black holes and AGNs. The broad-line profile provides valuable information on BLR geometry and kinematics. In this work, we explore the evolution of line profiles in variable AGNs based on the BLR model of Czerny and Hryniewicz, where the BLR is driven by the radiation pressure acting on dust at the surface layers of the accretion disk. The line profiles in the low-Eddington-ratio regime show a double-peak profile, which will become a single peak at high Eddington ratios. The high metallicity of Z ≳ 5 Z⊙ is required to reproduce the observational anticorrelation between the peak separation of broad lines and the Eddington ratio for a sample of AGNs. For the broad lines in variable AGNs, it will take several years to several decades to change their line profile if the disk luminosity suffers strong variation in a much shorter timescale. More monitoring of the broad line and continuum in strongly variable AGNs can shed special light on BLR physics.

<title>High-resolution BOES Spectroscopy of Raman-scattered He ii λ6545 in Young Planetary Nebulae</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Young planetary nebulae (PNe) are characterized by their hot central stars and the presence of abundant neutral and molecular components, which result from significant mass loss during the asymptotic giant branch phase of stellar evolution. Far-UV He iiλ1025 line photons produced near the central star can undergo Raman scattering by hydrogen atoms, creating a broad emission feature centered at ~6545 Å. We conducted high-resolution spectroscopy of 12 young PNe from 2019 April to 2020 March using the Bohyunsan Observatory Echelle Spectrograph. Building on the study by Choi and Lee, who identified Raman-scattered He ii at 6545 Å in NGC 6881 and NGC 6886, we report new detections of this feature in NGC 6741 and NGC 6884. Profile fitting reveals that the velocity of the H i component relative to the He ii emission region ranges from 26 to 33 km s−1 in these PNe. Using photoionization modeling, we estimate the line flux of He iiλ1025 and derive Raman conversion efficiencies of 0.39, 0.21, 0.24, and 0.07 for NGC 6881, NGC 6741, NGC 6886, and NGC 6884, respectively. These results, combined with radiative transfer modeling, suggest the presence of H i components with masses around 10−2M⊙, moving outward from the central He ii emission region at speeds characteristic of the slow stellar wind from a mass-losing giant star.

<title>The Microlensing Event Rate and Optical Depth from MOA-II 9 Yr Survey Toward the Galactic Bulge</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present measurements of the microlensing optical depth and event rate toward the Galactic bulge using the data set from the 2006 to 2014 MOA-II survey, which covers 22 bulge fields spanning ∼42 deg2 between −5° < l < 10° and −7° < b < −1°. In the central region with ∣l∣ < 5°, we estimate an optical depth of and an event rate of Γ = [16.08 ± 0.28] × 10−6 using a sample consisting of 3525 microlensing events, with Einstein radius crossing times of tE < 760 days and a source star magnitude of Is < 21.4 mag. We confirm our results are consistent with the latest measurements from the OGLE-IV 8 yr data set. We find our result is inconsistent with a prediction based on Galactic models, especially in the central region with ∣b∣ < 3°. These results can be used to improve the Galactic bulge model, and more central regions can be further elucidated by upcoming microlensing experiments, such as the PRime-focus Infrared Microlensing Experiment and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

<title>Deep Searches for Radio Pulsations and Bursts from Four Magnetar and a Magnetar-like Pulsar with FAST</title>

We report on radio observations of four magnetars SGR 0501+4516, Swift 1834.9–0846, 1E 1841–045, SGR 1900+14, and a magnetar-like pulsar PSR J1846–0258 with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope at 1250 MHz. Notably, PSR J1846–0258 was observed 1 month after its 2020 X-ray outburst. The data from these observations were searched for periodic emissions and single pulses. No radio emission was detected for any of our targets. After accounting for the effect of red noise, the nondetections yield stringent upper limits on the radio flux density, with S1250 ≤ 16.9 μJy for the four magnetars and the magnetar-like pulsar, along with constraints on single-pulse flux densities. Our deep radio observations suggest that these magnetars and the magnetar-like pulsar are indeed radio-quiet sources or unfavorably beamed. The resulting flux upper limits, along with previous findings, are discussed, highlighting the significance of further radio observations of radio-quiet magnetars and the high-B magnetar-like pulsar.

<title>The First Exploration of the Correlations Between WISE 12 μm and CO Emission in Early-type Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the analysis of a comprehensive sample of 352 early-type galaxies using public data, to investigate the correlations between CO luminosities and mid-infrared luminosities observed by Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. We find strong correlations between both CO (1–0) and CO (2–1) luminosities and 12 μm luminosity, boasting a correlation coefficient greater than 0.9 and an intrinsic scatter smaller than 0.1 dex. The consistent slopes observed for the relationships of CO (1–0) and CO (2–1) suggest that the line ratio R21 lacks correlation with mid-infrared emission in early-type galaxies, which is significantly different from star-forming galaxies. Moreover, the slopes of LCO(1−0)–L12 μm and LCO(2−1)–L12 μm relations in early-type galaxies are steeper than those observed in star-forming galaxies. Given the absence of correlation with color, morphology, or specific star formation rate (sSFR), the correlation between deviations and the molecular gas mass surface density could be eliminated by correcting the possible 12 μm emission from old stars or adopting a systematically different αCO. The latter, on average, is equivalent to adding a constant CO brightness density, specifically and for CO (1–0) and (2–1), respectively. These explorations will serve as useful tools for estimating the molecular gas content in gas-poor galaxies and understanding associated quenching processes.

<title>Molecular Distributions and Abundances in the Binary-shaped Outflow of V Hya</title>

Binaries are known to play a key role in the mass loss and dynamical environments of evolved stars. Stellar and substellar companion interactions produce complex wind morphologies including rotating/expanding disks, bipolar outflows, and spiral wind patterns; however, the connection between these many structures and the gas-phase chemistry they harbor is not well constrained. To expand the sample of chemical inventories in interacting systems, we present a detailed spectroscopic case study of the binary C-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star V Hya. Using spatially resolved Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations at Bands 3, 6, and 7, we characterize the rotational emission lines and distributions of molecules in its surrounding disk undergoing dynamical expansion (DUDE). We detect emission from over 15 molecules and isotopologues toward this source, and present resolved maps for the brightest tracers of carbonaceous chemistry (e.g., CCH, C4H, HC5N, HNC, and ). Employing LTE and non-LTE models of emission from the DUDE, we estimate the abundance distributions for optically thin species, and compare them with prototypical carbon-rich AGB envelopes. We find that the average abundances of detected species are within a factor of ∼5 from sources with similar mass-loss rates; however, the distribution of daughter species in V Hya is much more compact, with carbon chain species (CCH, C4H, and HC3N) appearing with abundances >10−7 even in the innermost sampled regions (200 au) of the disk.

The European Space Agency's Rosetta mission is the only space mission that has performed long-term monitoring of a comet at close distances. For over two years, Rosetta rendezvoused with comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, which revealed diverse evolutionary processes of the cometary nucleus. One of the most striking events is the migration of a ∼30 m boulder in the southern hemisphere region of Khonsu. Previous works found the boulder's ∼140 m displacement occurred during the three months from 2015 August to October, and several triggering mechanisms were proposed, including outburst at the boulder site, seismic vibrations from nearby activities, or surface erosion of the slope beneath the boulder. In this work, we further analyze this impressive event by analyzing imaging data from Rosetta's OSIRIS camera. We constrained the boulder's migration time to within 14 hr and derived a detailed timeline of the boulder migration event and local dust activities. High-resolution thermophysical modeling shows significant dichotomy in the thermal history of the boulder's southern and northern sides, which could have triggered or facilitated its migration via its own volatile activity.

<title>The Prevalence of Star-forming Clumps as a Function of Environmental Overdensity in Local Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
At the peak of cosmic star formation (1 ≲ z ≲ 2), the majority of star-forming galaxies hosted compact, star-forming clumps, which were responsible for a large fraction of cosmic star formation. By comparison, ≲5% of local star-forming galaxies host comparable clumps. In this work, we investigate the link between the environmental conditions surrounding local (z < 0.04) galaxies and the prevalence of clumps in these galaxies. To obtain our clump sample, we use a Faster R-CNN object detection network trained on the catalog of clump labels provided by the Galaxy Zoo: Clump Scout project, then apply this network to detect clumps in approximately 240,000 Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies (originally selected for Galaxy Zoo 2). The resulting sample of 41,445 u-band bright clumps in 34,246 galaxies is the largest sample of clumps yet assembled. We then select a volume-limited sample of 9964 galaxies and estimate the density of their local environment using the distance to their projected fifth nearest neighbor. We find a robust correlation between environment and the clumpy fraction (fclumpy) for star-forming galaxies (specific star formation rate, sSFR > 10−2 Gyr−1) but find little to no relationship when controlling for galaxies’ sSFR or color. Further, fclumpy increases significantly with sSFR in local galaxies, particularly above sSFR > 10−1 Gyr−1. We posit that a galaxy’s gas fraction primarily controls the formation and lifetime of its clumps, and that environmental interactions play a smaller role.

<title>The Red Supergiant Progenitor Luminosity Problem</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8f3f</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Analysis of pre-explosion imaging has confirmed red supergiants (RSGs) as the progenitors to Type II-P supernovae (SNe). However, extracting an RSG's luminosity requires assumptions regarding the star’s temperature or spectral type and the corresponding bolometric correction, circumstellar extinction, and possible variability. The robustness of these assumptions is difficult to test since we cannot go back in time and obtain additional pre-explosion imaging. Here, we perform a simple test using the RSGs in M31, which have been well observed from optical to mid-IR. We ask the following: By treating each star as if we only had single-band photometry and making assumptions typically used in SN progenitor studies, what bolometric luminosity would we infer for each star? How close is this to the bolometric luminosity for that same star inferred from the full optical-to-IR spectral energy distribution (SED)? We find common assumptions adopted in progenitor studies systematically underestimate the bolometric luminosity by a factor of 2, typically leading to inferred progenitor masses that are systematically too low. Additionally, we find a much larger spread in luminosity derived from single-filter photometry compared to SED-derived luminosities, indicating uncertainties in progenitor luminosities are also underestimated. When these corrections and larger uncertainties are included in the analysis, even the most luminous known RSGs are not ruled out at the 3σ level, indicating there is currently no statistically significant evidence that the most luminous RSGs are missing from the observed sample of II-P progenitors. The proposed correction also alleviates the problem of having progenitors with masses below the expected lower-mass bound for core collapse.

The Compton Spectrometer and Imager balloon payload (COSI-Balloon) is a wide field-of-view Compton gamma-ray telescope that operates in the 0.2–5 MeV bandpass. COSI-Balloon had a successful 46 day flight in 2016 during which the instrument observed the Crab Nebula, Cygnus X-1, and Centaurus A. Using the data collected by the COSI-Balloon instrument during this flight, we present the source flux extraction of signals from the variable balloon background environment and produce images of these background-dominated sources by performing Richardson–Lucy deconvolutions. We also present the spectra measured by the COSI-Balloon instrument, compare and combine them with measurements from other instruments, and fit the data. The Crab Nebula was observed by COSI-Balloon, and we obtain a measured flux in the energy band 325–480 keV of (4.5 ± 1.6) × 103 ph cm−2 s−1. The model that best fits the COSI-Balloon data combined with measurements from NuSTAR and Swift-BAT is a broken power law with a measured photon index Γ = 2.20 ± 0.02 above the 43 keV break. Cygnus X-1 was also observed during this flight, and we obtain a measured flux of (1.4 ± 0.2) × 103 ph cm−2 s−1 in the same energy band and a best-fit result (including data from NuSTAR, Swift-BAT, and INTEGRAL/IBIS) was a cutoff power law with a high-energy cutoff energy of 138.3 ± 1.0 keV and a photon index of Γ = 1.358 ± 0.002. Finally, we present the measured spectrum of Centaurus A and our best model fit to a power law with a photon index of Γ = 1.73 ± 0.01.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In an effort to search for faint sources of emission over arbitrary timescales, we present a novel method for analyzing forced photometry light curves in difference imaging from optical surveys. Our method “ATLAS Clean,” or ATClean, utilizes the reported fluxes, uncertainties, and fits to the point-spread function (PSF) from difference images to quantify the statistical significance of individual measurements. We apply this method to control light curves across the image to determine whether any source of flux is present in the data for a range of specific timescales. From ATLAS o-band imaging at the site of the Type II supernova (SN) 2023ixf in M101 from 2015–2023, we show that this method accurately reproduces the 3σ flux limits produced from other, more computationally expensive methods. We derive limits for emission on timescales of 5 days and 80–300 days at the site of SN 2023ixf, which are 19.8 and 21.3 mag, respectively. The latter limits rule out variability for unextinguished red supergiants with initial masses >22 M⊙, comparable to the most luminous predictions for the SN 2023ixf progenitor system. We also compare our limits to short-timescale outbursts, similar to those expected for Type IIn SN progenitor stars or the Type II SN 2020tlf, and rule out outburst ejecta masses of >0.021 M⊙, much lower than the inferred mass of circumstellar matter around SN 2023ixf in the literature. In the future, these methods can be applied to any forced photometry on difference imaging from other surveys, such as Rubin optical imaging.

<title>Failure of a Solar Filament Eruption Caused by Magnetic Reconnection with Overlying Coronal Loops</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The failure of a filament eruption caused by magnetic reconnection between the erupting filament and the overlying magnetic field has been previously proposed in numerical simulations. It is, however, rarely observed. In this study, we report a reconnection between an erupting filament and its overlying coronal loops that results in the failure of the filament eruption. On 2023 September 24, a filament was located in active region 13445. It slowly rose, quickly erupted, rapidly decelerated, then finally stopped, with an untwisting motion. As a failed eruption, the event is associated with an M4.4 flare but no coronal mass ejection. During the eruption, the filament became bright, and the overlying loops appeared first in the high-temperature channels. They have average temperatures of ∼12.8 and ∼9.6 MK, respectively, indicating that both of them were heated. Two sets of new loops, separately connecting the filament endpoints and the overlying loop footpoints, then formed. Subsequently, the heated overlying loops were seen sequentially in the low-temperature channels, showing the cooling process, which is also supported by the light curves. Plasmoids formed and propagated bidirectionally along the filament and the overlying loops, indicating the presence of plasmoid instability. These results suggest that reconnection occurs between the erupting filament and the overlying loops. The erupting filament eventually disappeared, with the appearance of more newly formed loops. We propose that the reconnection between the erupting filament and the overlying loops ruins the filament completely, hence resulting in the failed eruption.

<title>Modeling High Mass X-Ray Binaries to Double Neutron Stars through Common Envelope Evolution</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present detailed evolutionary simulations of wide binary systems with high-mass (8–20 M⊙) donor stars and a 1.4 M⊙ neutron star. Mass transfer in such binaries is dynamically unstable, and common envelope (CE) evolution is followed. We use a recently developed prescription to deal with CE evolution and consider various CE ejection efficiencies varying in the range of 0.1–3.0. We focus on the evolutionary consequences of the binaries that survived CE evolution. We demonstrate that it is possible for the binaries to enter a CE decoupling phase (CEDP) when the donor stars are partially stripped, leaving a hydrogen envelope of ≲1.0–4.0 M⊙ after CE evolution. This phase is expected to last ∼104–105 yr, during which mass transfer occurs stably via Roche lobe overflow with super-Eddington rates. Identification of some X-ray binaries in a CEDP is important for the understanding of the physics of CE evolution itself, the origin of ultraluminous X-ray sources, and the recycling process of accreting pulsars. Also, we discuss the formation of double neutron stars and the occurrence of ultrastripped supernovae according to the results from our simulations. On the whole, the properties of post-CE binaries are sensitive to the options of CE ejection efficiencies.

<title>3D Localization of FRB 20190425A for Its Potential Host Galaxy and Implications</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are high-energy, short-duration phenomena in radio astronomy. Identifying their host galaxies can provide insights into their mysterious origins. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to identifying potential host galaxies in three-dimensional space. We use FRB 20190425A and GW190425 as examples to illustrate our method. Recently, due to spatial and temporal proximity, the potential association of GW190425 with FRB 20190425A has drawn attention, leading to the identification of a likely host galaxy, UGC 10667, albeit without confirmed kilonova emissions. We search for the host galaxy of FRB 20190425A with a full CHIME localization map. Regardless of the validity of the association between GW190425 and FRB 20190425A, we identify an additional potential host galaxy (SDSS J171046.84+212732.9) from the updated GLADE galaxy catalog, supplementing the importance of exploring the new volume. We employed various methodologies to determine the most probable host galaxy of GW190424 and FRB 20190425A, including a comparison of galaxy properties and constraints on their reported observation limits using various kilonova models. Our analysis suggests that current observations do not definitively identify the true host galaxy. Additionally, the kilonova models characterized by a gradual approach to their peak are contradicted by the observational upper limits of both galaxies. Although the absence of optical emission detection raises doubts, it does not definitively disprove the connection between the gravitational wave (GW) and FRB.

<title>Tidally Distorted Stars Are Triaxial Pulsators</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Stars in close binaries are tidally distorted, and this has a strong effect on their pulsation modes. We compute the mode frequencies and geometries of tidally distorted stars using perturbation theory, accounting for the effects of the Coriolis force and the coupling between different azimuthal orders m of a multiplet induced by the tidal distortion. For tidally coupled dipole pressure modes, the tidal coupling dominates over the Coriolis force and the resulting pulsations are “triaxial,” with each of the three modes in a multiplet “tidally tilted,” to be aligned with one of the three principal axes of the star. The observed amplitudes and phases of the dipole modes aligned orthogonal to the spin axis are modulated throughout the orbit, producing doublets in the power spectrum that are spaced by exactly twice the orbital frequency. Quadrupole modes have similar but slightly more complex behavior. This amplitude modulation allows for mode identification, which can potentially enable detailed asteroseismic analyses of tidally tilted pulsators. Pressure modes should exhibit this behavior in stellar binaries close enough to be tidally synchronized, while gravity modes should remain aligned with the star's spin axis. We discuss applications to various types of pulsating stars and the relationship between the tidal tilting of pulsations and the “single-sided” pulsations sometimes observed in very tidally distorted stars.

The bulk abundances of exoplanetesimals can be measured when they are accreted by white dwarfs. Recently, lithium from the accretion of exoplanetesimals was detected in relatively high levels in multiple white dwarfs. There are presently three proposed hypotheses to explain the detection of excess lithium in white dwarf photospheres: Big Bang and Galactic nucleosynthesis, continental crust, and an exomoon formed from spalled ring material. We present new observations of three previously known lithium-polluted white dwarfs (WD J1824+1213, WD J2317+1830, and LHS 2534), and one with metal pollution without lithium (SDSS J1636+1619). We also present atmospheric model fits to these white dwarfs. We then evaluate the abundances of these white dwarfs and two additional lithium-polluted white dwarfs that were previously fit using the same atmospheric models (WD J1644-0449 and SDSS J1330+6435) in the context of the three extant hypotheses for explaining lithium excesses in polluted white dwarfs. We find Big Bang and Galactic nucleosynthesis to be the most plausible explanation of the abundances in WD J1644-0449, WD J1824+1213, and WD J2317+1830. SDSS J1330+6435 will require stricter abundances to determine its planetesimal’s origins, and LHS 2534, as presently modeled, defies all three hypotheses. We find the accretion of an exomoon formed from spalled ring material to be highly unlikely to be the explanation of the lithium excess in any of these cases.

<title>Water Ice in the Edge-on Orion Silhouette Disk 114–426 from JWST NIRCam Images</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We examine images of the protoplanetary disk 114–426 with JWST/NIRCam in 12 bands. This large disk is oriented edge on with a dark midplane flanked by lobes of scattered light. The outer edges of the midplane are seen in silhouette against the Orion Nebula, providing a unique opportunity to study planet-forming material in absorption. We discover a dip in the scattered light of the disk at 3 μm—compelling evidence for the presence of water ice. The 3 μm dip is also seen in the silhouette of the disk, where we quantify the ice abundance with models of pure absorption and avoid the complications of disk scattering effects. We find grain ice-to-refractory mass ratios of up to ~0.2, maximum grain sizes of 0.25–5 μm, and a total dust plus ice mass of 0.46 M⊕ in the silhouette region. We also discover excess absorption in the NIRCam bands that include the Paα line, suggesting there may be excited atomic hydrogen in the disk. Examining the morphology of the scattered light lobes reveals that they are laterally offset from each other and exhibit a brightness asymmetry that flips with wavelength—both evidence for a tilted inner disk in this system.

<title>Interaction of an Outflow with Surrounding Gaseous Clouds as the Origin of Late-time Radio Flares in Tidal Disruption Events</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b98</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Close encounter between a star and a supermassive black hole (SMBH) results in the tidal disruption of the star, known as a tidal disruption event (TDE). Recently, a few TDEs, e.g., ASASSN-15oi and AT2018hyz, have shown late-time (hundreds of days after their UV/optical peaks) radio flares with radio luminosities of 1038∼39 erg s−1. The super-Eddington fallback or accretion in a TDE may generate a mass outflow. Here, we investigate a scenario that the late-time radio flares come from the interaction of the outflow with the circumnuclear gaseous clouds, in addition to the slow-evolving emission component due to the outflow–diffuse medium interaction. We calculate the associated radio temporal and spectral signatures and find that they reproduce well the observations. The outflows have the inferred velocity of 0.2c ∼ 0.6c, the total mass of 10−3 ∼ 10−1M⊙ and the ejection duration of a month to a year. The distances of the clouds to the SMBH are 0.1 ∼ 1 pc. This scenario has advantages in explaining the long delay, sharpness of the rise, and the multiplicity of the late radio flares. Future observations may build up a much larger sample of late-time radio flares and enable their use as a probe of the TDE physics and the host circumnuclear environment.

<title>Discoveries and Properties of EL CVn–type Binaries in the TESS Survey</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b9c</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
EL CVn–type systems represent a rare evolutionary stage in binary star evolution, providing ideal laboratories for investigating stable mass-transfer processes and the formation of extremely low-mass white dwarfs (ELM WDs). The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has delivered an extensive collection of high-precision time-domain photometric data, which is invaluable for studying EL CVn binaries. In this study, we identified 29 EL CVn systems from the TESS eclipsing binary catalogs (sectors 1–65), 11 of which are newly discovered. These systems consist of smaller, hotter prehelium WDs and A/F main-sequence stars. The orbital periods of these binaries range from 0.64 to 2.5 days. Utilizing TESS light curves, Gaia distances, and multiband photometric data (e.g., Galaxy Evolution Explorer, Two Micron All Sky Survey, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, SkyMapper), we modeled the light curves and spectral energy distributions to derive system parameters, including effective temperatures, masses, and radii. These systems were then compared with the WD mass–period relation and the evolutionary tracks of ELM WDs. The comparison reveals that these binaries are consistent with the expected mass–period relation for WDs and align well with the evolutionary tracks on the Teff − diagram for ELM WDs. This result suggests that these EL CVn systems likely formed through stable mass-transfer processes. We provide a catalog of complete parameters for 29 EL CVn systems identified from the TESS survey. This catalog will serve as an essential resource for studying binary mass transfer, WD formation, and pulsation phenomena in EL CVn–type systems.

<title>Shock and SEP Modeling Study for the 2022 September 5 SEP Event</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada0be</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
On 2022 September 5, during Parker Solar Probe's (PSP) 13th encounter, a fast shock wave and a related solar energetic particle (SEP) event were observed as the spacecraft approached the perihelion of its orbit. Observations from the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (IS⊙IS) instrument suite show that SEPs arrived at the spacecraft with a significant delay from the onset of the parent solar eruption and that the first arriving SEPs exhibited an inverse velocity dispersion (IVD) for energetic protons above ~1 MeV. Utilizing data from multiple spacecraft, we investigate the eruption dynamics and shock wave propagation. Our analysis includes 3D shock modeling and SEP transport simulations to examine the origins of this SEP event and explore the causes of the delayed SEP onset and the observed IVD. The data-driven SEP simulation reproduces the SEP event onset observed at PSP, its evolving energy spectrum, and the IVD. This IVD is attributed to a relatively slow, ongoing particle acceleration process occurring at the flank of the expanding shock wave intercepted by PSP. This has significant implications for the role of shocks in the release of SEPs at widespread events and for methods used to infer the SEP release times. Furthermore, the match between the simulation and observations worsens when cross-field diffusion is considered, indicating that SEP diffusion had a minor effect on this event. These findings underscore the complexity of SEP events and emphasize the need for advanced modeling approaches to better understand the role of shock waves and other physical processes in SEP acceleration and release.

<title>The Fate of Oceans on First-generation Planets Orbiting White Dwarfs</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada149</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada149</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Several groups have recently suggested that small planets orbiting very closely around white dwarf stars could be promising locations for life to arise, even after stellar death. There are still many uncertainties, however, regarding the existence and habitability of these worlds. Here we consider the retention of water during post-main-sequence evolution of a Sun-like star and during the subsequent migration of planets to the white dwarf's habitable zone. This inward migration is driven by dynamical mechanisms such as planet–planet interactions in packed systems, which can excite planets to high eccentricities, setting the initial conditions for tidal migration into short-period orbits. In order for water to persist on the surfaces of planets orbiting white dwarfs, the water must first survive the asymptotic giant branch phase of stellar evolution, then avoid being lost as a result of photoevaporation due to X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet radiation from the newly formed white dwarf, and finally survive the tidal migration of the planet inward to the habitable zone. We find that while this journey will likely desiccate large swaths of post-main-sequence planetary systems, planets with substantial reservoirs of water may retain some surface water, especially if their migration occurs at later white dwarf cooling ages. Therefore, although stellar evolution may pose a challenge for the retention of water on exoplanet surfaces, it is possible for planets to retain surface oceans even as their host stars die and their orbits evolve.

<title>Are Stars Really Ingesting Their Planets? Examining an Alternative Explanation</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada1d5</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada1d5</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Numerous stars exhibit surprisingly large variations in their refractory element abundances, often interpreted as signatures of planetary ingestion events. In this study, we propose that differences in the dust-to-gas ratio near stars during their formation can produce similar observational signals. We investigate this hypothesis using a suite of radiation-dust-magnetohydrodynamic STAR FORmation in Gaseous Environments (or STARFORGE) simulations of star formation. Our results show that the distribution of refractory abundance variations (Δ[X/H]) has extended tails, with about 10%–30% of all stars displaying variations around ∼0.1 dex. These variations are comparable to the accretion of 2–5 M⊕ of planetary material into the convective zones of Sun-like stars. The width of the distributions increases with the incorporation of more detailed dust physics, such as radiation pressure and back-reaction forces, as well as with larger dust grain sizes and finer resolutions. Furthermore, our simulations reveal no correlation between Δ[X/H] and stellar separations, suggesting that dust-to-gas fluctuations likely occur on scales smaller than those of wide binaries. These findings highlight the importance of considering dust dynamics as a potential source of the observed chemical enrichment in stars.

<title>DA 362: A Gamma-Ray-emitting Compact Symmetric Object</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada1d7</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The γ-ray detection from an astrophysical object indicates the presence of an extreme environment where high-energy radiation is produced. With the continuous monitoring of the γ-ray sky by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) leading to deeper sensitivity, high-energy γ-ray emission has now been detected from a diverse class of jetted active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here, we present the results of a multiwavelength study of the radio source DA 362, which was reported to be a blazar candidate of uncertain type. However, it was recently identified as a bona fide compact symmetric object (CSO) based on its subkiloparsec, bipolar radio morphology, and lack of radio variability. This makes DA 362 only the fourth γ-ray-emitting object of this enigmatic class of radio-loud AGNs. Using five very-long-baseline interferometry observations covering 1996–2018, we found the jet separation velocity to be subluminal (vapp ~ 0.2c), thus supporting its CSO nature. Its Fermi-LAT observations revealed a γ-ray flaring activity, a phenomenon never detected from the other three γ-ray-detected CSOs. This object is bright in the near-infrared band but extremely faint in the optical-UV filters, hinting at possible obscuration. Swift X-Ray Telescope observation of DA 362 reveals an extremely hard X-ray spectrum, though a strong claim cannot be made due to large uncertainties. We conclude that deeper observations are needed to probe the broadband properties of this enigmatic object and to understand the origin of high-energy γ-ray emission.

<title>Autogenous Electron Acceleration by Ion Flow Vortex in Space Plasmas</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada269</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Plasma flow vortexes are ubiquitous in space and astrophysical settings and play a vital role in energy and mass transport, contributing to formation of stars and planets, launching and dissipation of astrophysical jets, and coupling between planetary magnetospheres and ionospheres. Here we present in situ observations showing that energetic electrons with energies up to 250 keV can be directly generated inside an ion flow vortex with finite spatial scale. The electron acceleration is achieved by establishment of Fermi acceleration trap and parallel electrostatic potential within the flow vortex, leading to dramatic enhancement of energetic electron flux by at least 1 order of magnitude. The accelerated electrons can drive mass and energy transport along local magnetic field lines and serve as a free energy source for broadband electrostatic emissions. Our observations, suggesting that the ion flow vortex can serve as novel electron accelerators, can be fundamentally important for understanding energetic phenomena in the cosmos, such as nonthermal emissions near astrophysical jets and killer electrons in geospace.

<title>Photometric Selection of Type 1 Quasars in the XMM-LSS Field with Machine Learning and the Disk–Corona Connection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present photometric selection of type 1 quasars in the ≈5.3 deg2 XMM-Large Scale Structure survey field with machine learning. We constructed our training and blind-test samples using spectroscopically identified Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasars, galaxies, and stars. We utilized the XGBoost machine learning method to select a total of 1591 quasars. We assessed the classification performance based on the blind-test sample, and the outcome was favorable, demonstrating high reliability (≈99.9%) and good completeness (≈87.5%). We used XGBoost to estimate photometric redshifts of our selected quasars. The estimated photometric redshifts span a range from 0.41 to 3.75. The outlier fraction of these photometric redshift estimates is ≈17%, and the normalized median absolute deviation (σNMAD) is ≈0.07. To study the quasar disk–corona connection, we constructed a subsample of 1016 quasars with Hyper Suprime-Cam i < 22.5 after excluding radio-loud and potentially X-ray-absorbed quasars. The relation between the optical-to-X-ray power-law slope parameter (αOX) and the 2500 Å monochromatic luminosity (L2500Å) for this subsample is with a dispersion of 0.159. We found this correlation in good agreement with the correlations in previous studies. We explored several factors, which may bias the αOX–L2500Å relation, and found that their effects are not significant. We discussed possible evolution of the αOX–L2500Å relation with respect to L2500Å or redshift.

<title>Interplay of Large-scale Drift and Turbulence in the Heliospheric Propagation of Solar Energetic Particles</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The gradient and curvature of the Parker spiral interplanetary magnetic field give rise to curvature and gradient guiding-center drifts on cosmic rays (CRs). The plasma turbulence present in interplanetary space is thought to suppress the drifts; however, the extent to which they are reduced is not clear. We investigate the reduction of the drifts using a new analytic model of heliospheric turbulence where the dominant 2D component has both a wavevector and magnetic field vector normal to the Parker spiral, thus fulfilling the main criterion of 2D turbulence. We use full-orbit test-particle simulations of energetic protons in the modeled interplanetary turbulence, and analyze the mean drift velocity of the particles in heliolatitude. We release energetic proton populations of 10, 100, and 1000 MeV close to the Sun and introduce a new method to assess their drift. We compare the drift in the turbulent heliosphere to drift in a configuration without turbulence, and to theoretical estimates of drift reduction. We find that drifts are reduced by a factor 0.2–0.9 of that expected for the heliospheric configuration without turbulence. This corresponds to a much less efficient suppression than what is predicted by theoretical estimates, particularly at low proton energies. We conclude that guiding-center drifts are a significant factor for the evolution of CR intensities in the heliosphere, including the propagation of solar energetic particles in the inner heliosphere.

<title>Collisionless Tearing Instability in Relativistic Nonthermal Pair Plasma and Its Application to MHD Turbulence</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Collisionless tearing instability with a power-law distribution function in a relativistic pair plasma with a guide field is studied. When the current sheet is supported by plasma pressure, the tearing mode is suppressed as the particle spectrum hardens. In the force-free limit, the instability growth rate becomes independent of the particle spectrum. We apply these results to relativistic MHD turbulence, where magnetic energy greatly exceeds plasma rest energy, and derive an expression for the transverse size of turbulent eddies unstable to tearing mode. We also establish the critical plasma magnetization parameter above which charge starvation prevents the tearing instability. These results might be useful for developing more accurate models of particle acceleration in relativistic astrophysical sources.

<title>The Age–Velocity Dispersion Relations of the Galactic Disk as Revealed by the LAMOST-Gaia Red Clump Stars</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9d41</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9d41</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using nearly 230,000 red clump stars selected from LAMOST and Gaia, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the stellar age–velocity dispersion relations (AVRs) for various disk populations, within 5.0 ≤ R ≤ 15.0 kpc and ∣Z∣ ≤ 3.0 kpc. The AVRs of the whole red clump sample stars are accurately described as σv = σv,0 (τ + 0.1) , with βR, βϕ, and βZ displaying a global exponential decreasing trend with R, which may point to the difference in spatial distributions of various disk heating mechanisms. The measurements of β–R for various disks suggest that the thin disk exhibits a radial dependence, with a global exponential decreasing trend in βR–R and βZ–R, while βϕ remains a nearly constant value (around 0.20 ∼ 0.25) within 8.5 ≤ R ≤ 11.5 kpc. The thick disk displays a global increasing trend in βR–R, βϕ–R, and βZ–R. These results indicate that the thin disk stars are likely heated by long-term heating from giant molecular clouds and spiral arms, while thick disk stars are likely heated by some violent heating process from merger and accretion, and/or formed by the inside-out and upside-down star formation scenarios, and/or born in the chaotic mergers of gas-rich systems and/or turbulent interstellar medium. Our results also suggest that the disk perturbation by a recent minor merger from Sagittarius may have occurred within 3.0 Gyr.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A major challenge in gravitational-wave (GW) multimessenger astrophysics is the imprecise localization of GW compact binary mergers. We investigate the use of a method to include galaxy catalog information in performing parameter estimation of these events. We test its effectiveness with the GW events GW170817, GW190425, and GW190814, as well as with simulated binary neutron star mergers. For GW170817, we recover the true host galaxy as the most probable galaxy after a straightforward mass reweighting, with significantly decreased localization area and volume. On the simulated sample, however, we do not find improvement compared to performing a simple galaxy catalog crossmatch with a regular GW localization. Future investigations into sampling methods may yield improvements that increase the viability of this method.

<title>An Exceptionally Powerful, Radiatively Driven Ultrafast Outflow in the Rapidly Accreting AGN RE J1034+396</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9f3e</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9f3e</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the analysis of ∼1 Ms of XMM-Newton observations of the rapidly accreting active galactic nucleus RE J1034+396. The 0.3–9 keV EPIC-pn spectra are well described by a model consisting of steep continuum emission from the corona accompanied by relativistically blurred reflection from a highly ionized accretion disk. The source is known to exhibit strong excess soft X-ray emission, which we show is well represented by thermal disk photons Comptonized by a warm plasma spanning the inner accretion flow. Additionally, the EPIC-pn data provide compelling evidence (ΔC ∼ 60 for four additional parameters) for the presence of an ultrafast outflow (UFO) with a line-of-sight velocity , and an emission signature consistent with reflection of the corona from modestly ionized, outflowing gas. The simultaneous 0.5–2.5 keV RGS spectra show clear absorption lines. Modelling of these data confirms the presence of the UFO and constrains its equivalent hydrogen column density, log NH/(atom cm−2) = . The RGS data also reveal at least two warm absorber components with a modest outflow velocity ( km s−1). The measured properties and time evolution of the UFO in RE J1034+396 suggest that it is formed from collisionally ionized plasma, launched from the disk surface and accelerated by radiation pressure. The high terminal velocity and substantial absorbing column density imply that the outflow carries sufficient momentum and energy to transform its environment, being capable of driving out essentially all dust and gas it interacts with along the line of sight, even if the AGN were initially surrounded by a Compton-thick absorber.

<title>Empirical Color Correction to MIST and PARSEC Isochrones on Gaia BR − RP and G − RP with Benchmark Open Clusters</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent literature reports a color deviation between observed Gaia color–magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and theoretical model isochrone predictions, particularly in the very low-mass regime. To assess its impact on cluster age determination via isochrone fitting, we quantified the color deviations for three benchmark clusters, Hyades, Pleiades, and Praesepe, both for the Gaia color (BP − RP) and (G − RP). In general, the (G − RP) color deviations are smaller than the (BP − RP) ones. Empirical color-correction functions based on these benchmarks are derived for the currently available MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks and PAdova and TRieste Stellar Evolution Code (PARSEC) 1.2S isochrone models. Applying the correction functions to 31 additional open clusters and 3 moving groups results in a significantly improved alignment between the isochrones and observed CMDs. With our empirical corrections, isochrones provide age estimates consistent with literature values obtained through the spectral lithium depletion boundary method, validating the effectiveness of our approach. The corresponding metallicities with PARSEC 1.2S also show a good agreement with the spectroscopic results. The empirical color-correction function we present in this work offers a tool for a consistent age determination within the full mass range of stellar clusters using the isochrone fitting method.

<title>Persistence and Burn-in in Solar Coronal Magnetic Field Simulations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Simulations of solar phenomena play a vital role in space-weather prediction. A critical computational question for automating research workflows in the context of data-driven solar coronal magnetic field simulations is quantifying a simulation's burn-in time, after which a solar quantity has evolved away from an arbitrary initial condition to a physically more realistic state. A challenge to quantifying simulation burn-in is that the underlying solar processes and data, like many physical phenomena, are non-Markovian and exhibit long memory or persistence and, therefore, their analysis evades standard statistical approaches. In this work, we provide evidence of long memory in the nonperiodic variations of solar quantities (including over timescales significantly shorter than previously identified) and demonstrate that magnetofrictional simulations capture the memory structure present in magnetogram data. We also provide an algorithm for the quantitative assessment of simulation burn-in time that can be applied to nonstationary time series with long memory. Our approach is based on time-delayed mutual information, an information-theoretic quantity, and includes a small-sample bias correction.

Identifying Galactic PeVatrons (PeV particle accelerators) from ultrahigh-energy (UHE, >100 TeV) γ-ray sources plays a crucial role in revealing the origin of Galactic cosmic rays. The UHE source 1LHAASO J1857+0203u is suggested to be associated with HESS J1858+020, which may be attributed to the possible PeVatron candidate supernova remnant (SNR) G35.6−0.4 or H ii region G35.6−0.5. We perform detailed analysis on the very-high-energy and UHE γ-ray emissions toward this region with data from the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). 1LHAASO J1857+0203u is detected with a significance of 11.6σ above 100 TeV, indicating the presence of a PeVatron. It has an extent of ∼0 18 with a power-law (PL) spectral index of ∼2.5 at 1–25 TeV and pointlike emission with a PL spectral index of ∼3.2 above 25 TeV. Using archival CO and H i data, we identify some molecular and atomic clouds that may be associated with the TeV γ-ray emissions. Our modeling indicates that the TeV γ-ray emissions are unlikely to arise from clouds illuminated by the protons that escaped from SNR G35.6−0.4. In the scenario in which H ii region G35.6−0.5 could accelerate particles to the UHE band, the observed GeV–TeV γ-ray emission could be well explained by a hadronic model with a PL spectral index of ∼2.0 and cutoff energy of ∼450 TeV. However, an origin in an evolved pulsar wind nebula cannot be ruled out.

<title>Dissecting the Interstellar Media of a Wolf–Rayet Galaxy at z = 2.76</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report JWST/NIRSpec observations of a star-forming galaxy at z = 2.76, MACS J1149-WR1. We securely detect two temperature-sensitive auroral lines, [S iii] 6312 (7.4σ) and [O ii] 7320+7331 doublets (10σ), and tentatively [n ii] 5755 (2.3σ) for the first time in an individual galaxy at z > 1. We perform a detailed analysis of its interstellar media (ISM), and derive electron temperatures, various heavy element abundances (O/H, N/O, S/O, and Ar/O) in the hot ionized region, and the neutral fraction in the warm ionized region. MACS J1149-WR1 shows a broad feature at the wavelength of He ii 4686, which consists of a broad (∼1000 km s−1), blueshifted (∼−110 km s−1) line component. Taken together with its mildly elevated N/O abundance, we conclude that MACS J1149-WR1 is experiencing a young starburst (≲10 Myr), likely hosting a large number of Wolf–Rayet (W-R) stars. None of its spectral features support the presence of active galactic nuclei, including (i) the absence of broad components and velocity shifts in hydrogen recombination lines, (ii) low [Fe ii]1.257 μm/Paβ ratio, and (iii) the absence of high-ionization lines. Our analysis using He i lines reveals a higher electron temperature and a higher attenuation value, indicating that He i may probe a smaller spatial scale than H i, presumably the region dominated by the aforementioned W-R stars. The star formation rates derived from various He i lines broadly agree with those from hydrogen recombination lines. We thus advocate that He i can be an excellent, independent probe of multiphase ISM in the era of JWST.

<title>On Disk Formation around Isolated Black Holes via Stream Accretion</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate accretion onto an isolated black hole from uniform winds. If the winds are directed toward the black hole, then the accretion process can be well described by the classical Bondi–Hoyle–Lyttleton or BHL accretion. If the wind is not directed toward the black hole and flows past it, then a smaller fraction of the flow can be attracted by the black hole, and this type of accretion cannot be described by the classical BHL, and we coin the second kind as the lateral BHL. We show that the classical BHL cannot form an accretion disk, while lateral BHL can form transient accretion disks. To describe the thermodynamics of the flow, we have used a variable adiabatic index equation of state which depends on the temperature of the flow as well as the composition of the gas. We show that the electron-proton gas forms an accretion disk, which disappears and forms a shock cone, only to form the disk again at a later time, while for flows with fewer protons, the accretion disk, once lost, does not reappear again. Only when the flow is pair-dominated does it form a persistent accretion disk. We also show that a shock cone is less luminous than the accretion disk.

<title>A Subclass of Gamma-Ray Burst Originating from Compact Binary Merger</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad98ec</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad98ec</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Type I gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to originate from compact binary mergers usually with a duration of main emission less than 2 s. However, recent observations of GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A indicate that some merger-origin GRBs could last much longer. Since they show strikingly similar properties (indicating a common mechanism), which are different from the classic “long”-short burst (e.g., GRB 060614), we find they form an interesting subclass of type I GRBs, and we suggest to name them as type IL GRB. We find that the prompt emission of type IL GRB is composed of three episodes: (1) a precursor followed by a short quiescent (or weak emission) period, (2) a long-duration main emission, and (3) an extended emission. With this burst pattern, a good candidate, GRB 170228A, was found in the Fermi/Gamma-ray Burst Monitor archive data. Temporal and spectral analyses indeed show that GRB 170228A falls in the same group with GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A in many diagnostic figures. Thus, this burst pattern could be a good reference for rapidly identifying type IL GRBs and very helpful for conducting low-latency follow-up observation. We estimated the occurrence rate and discussed the physical origins and implications for the three emission episodes of type IL GRBs. Our analysis suggests the premerger precursor model, especially the magnetar super flare model, is more favored for type IL GRBs. More observations in multiwavelength and multimessenger are required to deepen our understanding of this subclass of GRB.

<title>High-time-cadence Spectroscopy and Photometry of Stellar Flares on M dwarf YZ Canis Minoris with the Seimei Telescope and TESS. I. Discovery of Rapid and Short-duration Prominence Eruptions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
M dwarfs show frequent flares and associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs) may significantly impact close-in habitable planets. M dwarf flares sometimes show blue/red asymmetries in the Hα line profile, suggesting prominence eruptions as an early stage of CMEs. However, their high-time-cadence observations are limited. We conducted spectroscopic monitoring observations of the active M dwarf YZ Canis Minoris with an ∼1 minute time cadence using the Seimei telescope, simultaneously with the optical photometric observations by Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. We detected 27 Hα flares with Hα energies ranging from 1.7 × 1029 to 3.8 × 1032 erg and durations from 8 to 319 minutes. Among them, we identified three blue asymmetry and five red asymmetry events based on criteria using the Bayesian information criterion. The maximum velocity of the blueshifted and redshifted components ranges from 200 to 450 km s−1 and 190 to 400 km s−1, respectively. The duration and time evolution show variety, and in particular, we discovered rapid, short-duration blue/red asymmetry events with the duration of 6–8 minutes. Among the eight blue/red asymmetry events, two blue and one red asymmetry events are interpreted as prominence eruptions because of their fast velocity and time evolution. Based on this interpretation, the lower limit of occurrence frequency of prominence eruptions can be estimated to be ∼1.1 events per day. Our discovery of short-duration events suggests that previous studies with low time cadence may have missed these events, potentially leading to an underestimation of the occurrence frequency of prominence eruptions/CMEs.

<title>A Peculiar Feature of the First Ionization Potential Effect Before a Solar Flare Impulsive Phase Observed by MSS-1B, CHASE, and SDO</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The impulsive phase of solar flares is often accompanied by the depletion of the elements with low first ionization potential (FIP), whose abundance decreases from the coronal level to the photospheric level, and then recovers back to the coronal level during the decay phase. Recently, we analyzed the soft X-ray spectroscopic data of the 2024 February 16 flare event observed by the Macao Science Satellite-1B/Soft X-ray Detection Units. Surprisingly, however, it is revealed that the depletion of the low-FIP elements occurred well before the flare impulsive phase. The timing of this change provides important clues about the location of magnetic reconnection, shedding light on the mass and energy transfer between different layers of the solar atmosphere. By examining the multiwavelength data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and CHASE missions, we found that there was no filament 0.4 hr before the flare eruption. However, an erupting filament was detected in association with the flare event. Based on these features, we propose for the first time that the flare/filament eruption for this event was initiated by magnetic reconnection in the solar chromosphere, rather than in the corona as stated in the standard flare model.

<title>Shocked POststarburst Galaxy Survey. IV. Outflows in Shocked Poststarburst Galaxies Are Not Responsible for Quenching</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Shocked POstarburst Galaxies (SPOGs) exhibit both emission lines suggestive of shock-heated gas and poststarburst-like stellar absorption, resulting in a unique subset for galaxy evolution studies. We have observed 77 galaxies that fulfilled the SPOG criteria selection using the DeVeny Spectrograph on the Lowell Discovery Telescope. Our long-slit minor axis spectra detect Hα and [O III] in some SPOGs out to 6 kpc above the galactic plane. We find extraplanar ionized gas in 31 targets of our sample overall. Using their internal and external kinematics, we argue that 22 galaxies host outflows with ionized gas masses ranging from 102M⊙ to 105M⊙. The rest are likely extended diffuse ionized gas. A positive correlation exists between active galactic nuclei (AGN) luminosity and the extraplanar gas extent, velocity dispersion, and mass—suggesting that the AGN may indeed drive the outflows detected in AGN hosts. The low masses of the extraplanar gas suggest that these outflows are not depleting each galaxy’s gas reserves. The outflows, therefore, are not likely a significant quenching mechanism in these SPOGs.

<title>Geometrical Distances of Extragalactic Binaries through Spectroastrometry</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The growing “Hubble tension” has prompted the need for precise measurements of cosmological distances. This paper demonstrates a purely geometric approach for determining the distances to extragalactic binaries through a joint analysis of spectroastrometry (SA), radial velocity (RV), and light-curve (LC) observations. A parameterized model for the binary system is outlined, and simulated SA, RV, and LC data are computed to infer the probability distribution of model parameters based on the mock data. The impacts of data quality and binary parameters on the distance uncertainties are comprehensively analyzed, showcasing the method’s potential for high-precision distance measurements. For a typical eclipsing binary in the Large Magellanic Cloud, the distance uncertainty is approximately 6% under reasonable observational conditions. Within a specific range of data quality and input parameters, the distance measurement precision of individual binary star systems is generally better than 10%. As a geometric method based on the simplest dynamics, it is independent of empirical calibration, and the systematics caused by model selections can be tested using nearby binaries with known distances. By measuring multiple binary star systems or monitoring one binary system repeatedly, geometric distance measurements of nearby galaxies can be achieved, providing valuable insights into the Hubble tension and advancing our understanding of the Universe’s structure and evolution.

<title>An Effect Study of Structural Jets on the Long Gamma-Ray Burst Formation Rate at Low Redshift</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are considered the most violent explosions in the Universe. Numerous studies have analyzed the formation rate of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), which originate from the core collapse of massive stars, in comparison with the star formation rate (SFR). It is found that the LGRB formation rate at redshift z < 1 is significantly distinct from the SFR and is higher. Moreover, due to the threshold of detectors, the structured jets of GRBs also affect detection numbers at different redshifts, which all influence the calculation of the formation rate. Thus we investigate the LGRB formation rate at low redshift and further explore the possible correlation between the LGRB formation rate under the influence of structural jets and the SFR. We use Lynden-Bell's c− method to study the luminosity function and rate of Swift LGRBs without any assumptions. After correcting for the redshift evolution, the luminosity function can be expressed as for dim LGRBs and for bright LGRBs, and the formation rate at z < 1 shows an increase. Then we use Monte Carlo simulations to create pseudo-GRBs with structured jets and calculate the formation rates assuming that the actual LGRB formation rate at low redshift is proportional to the SRF. The results demonstrate that structural jets increase the number of detections at low redshift in response to observational effects. Compared with the observed formation rate, the structured jet model with Gauss-cocoon is found to be relatively more efficient, and the parameters η of this model are limited and analyzed to [0.5, 5].

<title>Foreshock Ultralow Frequency Waves at Mars: Consequence on the Particle Acceleration Mechanisms at the Martian Bow Shock</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN Magnetometer observations, we report the first statistical study of ultralow frequency (ULF) waves at the Martian foreshock. The analyzed foreshock ULF wave events are observed in the 0.008–0.086 Hz frequency range, with nearly circular and elliptical left-handed polarization in the spacecraft reference frame. These waves are propagated quasi-parallel to the ambient magnetic field, with a moderate wave amplitude. All these properties are consistent with fast magnetosonic waves, most likely generated through the ion–ion right-hand resonant instability. In addition, our results suggest that the associated resonant backstreaming protons’ velocities parallel to the mean magnetic field in the solar wind reference frame are 1.33 ± 0.40 times the solar wind velocity. The similarity between our results and previous reports at other foreshocks may indicate the presence of a common acceleration process acting in planetary bow shocks and that is responsible for this particular backstreaming population.

<title>A Magnetohydrodynamics Simulation of Coronal Mass Ejections in the Upper Corona at 2.5R ⊙ ≤ r ≤ 19R ⊙</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The methodology of a new magnetohydrodynamics simulation model of the propagation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the near-Sun solar wind region at 2.5R⊙ ≥ r ≥ 19R⊙ is presented. The simulation model first determines the steady state of the transonic/Alfvénic solar wind with the characteristic-based inner boundary treatment for the middle of the corona at r = 2.5R⊙ (K. Hayashi et al. 2023). To determine the numerical perturbation on the 2.5 R⊙inner boundary surface, a kinetic self-similar model with a torus-shaped magnetic-field rope and a spherically symmetric plasma structure translating and expanding at the constant speed (named TICK model) is developed. A solar-wind MHD model (C.-C. Wu et al. 2020b) traces the temporal evolution of the injected CME through the inner boundary surface. We conducted test simulations with various choices of plasma density and temperature. The test simulation results show that the injected CME, particularly its internal magnetic structure, can be substantially altered through the interactions with the preexisting slow and dense ambient solar wind at the early phase of the propagation in the near-Sun region. The propagation speed of the discontinuity front is found to be dependent on the plasma parameters of the CME perturbation. Therefore, for better simulating the propagation of the CME, it is important for the CME models to include the nonlinear MHD interactions in the subsonic/Alfvénic regions.

<title>The Multiple Extended Tidal Tails of NGC 288</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada2ea</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using photometry and proper motions from Pan-STARRS, DECaLS, and Gaia Data Release 3, we detect a ∼35°–70° long trailing stellar debris stream associated with the globular cluster NGC 288. The trajectory of the trailing tail is not well matched by a model stream evolved in a static Galactic potential, but is reasonably well matched by a stream modeled in a potential that incorporates a massive, infalling Large Magellanic Cloud. We also detect a broad, at least ∼40° long leading tail that appears to be composed of at least two narrower, spatially offset, and kinematically distinct streams. Stream modeling predicts a similar broad composite of streams and suggests that these narrower components could each be made up of one or more generations of tidal tails, each formed during different orbits over the past few gigayears. On the other hand, NGC 288 is believed to have been brought into the Galactic halo during the Gaia–Enceladus–Sausage accretion event, and the tangential velocity dispersions of our stream candidates are indeed mostly consistent with having been stripped in a parent galaxy that had a large, cored dark matter halo. Tables of the most highly ranked stream star candidates are provided for ongoing and future spectroscopic surveys.

<title>Fitting Methods for Probability Distribution Functions in Turbulent Star-forming Clouds</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad99d5</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We use a suite of 3D simulations of star-forming molecular clouds, with and without stellar feedback and magnetic fields, to investigate the effectiveness of different fitting methods for volume and column density probability distribution functions (PDFs). The first method fits a piecewise lognormal and power-law (PL) function to recover PDF parameters such as the PL slope and transition density. The second method fits a polynomial spline function and examines the first and second derivatives of the spline to determine the PL slope and the functional transition density. The first PL (set by the transition between lognormal and PL function) can also be visualized in the derivatives directly. In general, the two methods produce fits that agree reasonably well for volume density but vary for column density, likely due to the increased statistical noise in the column density PDFs as compared to the volume density PDFs. We test a well-known conversion for estimating volume density PL slopes from column density slopes and find that the spline method produces a better match (χ2 of 3.34 versus χ2 of 5.92), albeit with a significant scatter. Ultimately, we recommend the use of both fitting methods on column density data to mitigate the effects of noise.

<title>Detecting the Black Hole Candidate Population in M51’s Young Massive Star Clusters: Constraints on Accreting Intermediate-mass Black Holes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Intermediate-mass black holes (102 < MBH < 105M⊙) are an open question in our understanding of black hole evolution and growth. They have long been linked to dense star cluster environments, thanks to cluster dynamics, but there are a limited number of secure detections. We leverage existing X-ray observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and optical catalogs from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) as well as new radio observations from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array to search for any evidence of accreting black holes in young massive star clusters in the nearby galaxy M51. We find that of 44 bright (LX > 1038 erg s−1) X-ray point sources in M51, 24 had probable matches to objects including possible associated star clusters in the HST Legacy Extragalactic UV Survey catalog, seven of which were classified as contaminants (background galaxies or foreground stars). We explore the optical properties of the remaining 17 sources, including cluster age and mass estimates, and search for radio counterparts in the 8–12 GHz band. The lack of radio counterparts to X-ray sources we know to be associated with young massive star clusters in M51 suggests that we do not significantly detect hard-state intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) ~104 M⊙ or above. However, more sensitive radio facilities, like the Square Kilometre Array and next-generation Very Large Array, may be able to provide evidence for IMBHs with masses down to ~103 M⊙.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Super-Earths are highly irradiated, small planets with bulk densities approximately consistent with Earth. We construct combined interior atmosphere models of super-Earths that trace the partitioning of water throughout a planet, including an iron-rich core, silicate-rich mantle, and steam atmosphere. We compare these models with exoplanet observations to infer a 1σ upper limit on the total water mass fraction of ≲3% at the population level. We consider end-member scenarios that may change this value, including the efficiency of mantle outgassing, escape of high mean molecular weight atmospheres, and increased iron core mass fractions. Although our constraints are agnostic as to the origin of water, we show that our upper limits are consistent with its production via chemical reactions of primordial hydrogen-dominated atmospheres with magma oceans. This mechanism has also been hypothesised to explain Earth's water content, possibly pointing to a unified channel for the origins of water on small terrestrial planets.

<title>A Sensitivity Analysis of the Modeling of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Emission in Galaxies</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9918</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have conducted a sensitivity analysis on the mid-infrared spectral decomposition of galaxies and the modeling of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission spectrum with the NASA Ames PAH Infrared Spectroscopic Database (PAHdb) to assess the variance on the average galaxy PAH population properties under a grid of different modeling parameters. We find that the short-low and short-low+long-low Spitzer-IRS decomposition with PAHFIT provides consistent modeling and recovery of the 5–15 μm PAH emission spectrum. For PAHdb modeling, application of a redshift to the calculated spectra to account for anharmonic effects introduces a 15%–20% variance on the derived parameters, while its absence improves the fits by ∼13%. The 4.00-α release of PAHdb achieves the complete modeling of the 6–15 μm PAH spectrum, including the full 6.2 μm band, improving the average fitting uncertainty by a factor of 2. The optimal PAHdb modeling configuration requires selection of pure PAHs without applying a redshift to the bands. Although quantitatively the PAHdb-derived parameters change under different modeling configurations or database versions, their variation follows a linear scaling, with previously reported trends remaining qualitatively valid. PAHdb modeling of JWST observations, and JWST observations smoothed and resampled to the Spitzer-IRS resolution and dispersion have consistent PAHdb derived parameters. Decomposition with different codes, such as PAHFIT and CAFE, produce PAH emission spectra with noticeable variation in the 11–15 μm region, driving a ∼7% difference in the neutral PAH fraction under PAHdb modeling. A new library of galaxy PAH emission templates is delivered to be utilized in galaxy spectral energy distribution modeling.

<title>Dependence of Metal Enrichment of Nuclear Star Clusters on Galaxy Stellar Mass</title>

Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are commonly found in the centers of galaxies, but their dominant formation mechanisms remain elusive. We perform a consistent analysis of stellar populations of 97 nearby NSCs, based on spectroscopic data from the Very Large Telescope. The sample covers a galaxy stellar mass range of 107–1011 M⊙ and is more than 3 times larger than any previous study. We identify three galaxy stellar mass regimes with distinct NSC properties. In the low-mass regime of ≲ 8.5 (Mhost is in units of M⊙), nearly all NSCs have metallicities lower than their circum-NSC host but similar to those of typical red globular clusters (GCs), supporting the GC inspiral–merger scenario of NSC formation. In the high-mass regime of ≳ 9.5, nearly all NSCs have higher metallicities than their circum-NSC host and red GCs, suggesting significant contributions from in situ star formation. In the intermediate-mass regime, a comparable fraction of NSCs have higher or lower metallicities than their circum-NSC host and red GCs, with no clear dependence on NSC mass, suggesting intermittent in situ star formation. The majority of NSCs with higher metallicities than their host exhibit a negative age–metallicity correlation, providing clear evidence of long-term chemical enrichment. The average metallicity difference between NSC and host peaks broadly around and declines toward both higher and lower galaxy masses. We find that the efficiency of dynamical-friction-driven inspiral of GCs observed in present-day galaxies can explain the NSC mass at but falls short of observed ones at higher galaxy mass, reinforcing our conclusions based on stellar population analysis.

Recently, a new type of magnetic reconnection, electron-only reconnection—where there is no obvious ion flow and heating—has been observed in various plasma environments. Previous kinetic simulations have shown that electron-only reconnection is a precursor of standard reconnection. In this paper, by performing a 2.5-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation, we investigate the evolution of electron-only magnetic reconnection to standard magnetic reconnection in a current sheet, whose initial width is of the electron inertial length. In the electron-only reconnection stage, electron outflow produces the electron-scale pileup, and ions are slightly accelerated in the outflow direction by the Hall electric field force. As the reconnection electric field expands and is piled up to the ion scale, ions start to be further accelerated inside the ion diffusion region and reflected by the to the outflow direction. With pileup as the bond, ions gradually transit from being accelerated by the Hall electric field to being coupled in reconnection by the Lorentz force.

<title>Exploring the Circumstellar Environment of Tycho’s Supernova Remnant. II. Impact on the Broadband Nonthermal Emission</title>

While the environment around Tycho's supernova remnant has long been believed to be close to homogeneous, the latest analysis of Chandra data has identified a substantial deceleration of the forward shock, which poses a major challenge to this picture. R. Kobashi et al. showed that the existence of dense molecular cloud (MC) surrounding a rarefied wind-like circumstellar matter (CSM) can explain this observational finding in terms of the shock-expansion dynamics, supporting the so-called single-degenerate scenario for the progenitor system. We here extend this work to study the nonthermal emission processes and investigate whether such an environment is consistent with the observed multiwavelength spectrum. While the simulated broadband spectrum based on the wind–MC environment is largely consistent with observations, we find that such an environment predicts a harder gamma-ray spectrum than observed due to the relatively low CSM density in the cavity interior of the MC. This difference can be at least partially attributed to the present 1D setup of the model, which does not account for the clumpy and multidimensional structure of the CSM. Our model provides predictions for the long-term evolution of the broadband spectrum, which can be used to further probe Tycho's surrounding environment in the future, a key to resolving the long-standing issue of Type Ia supernova progenitor channels.

<title>Einasto Profile as the Halo Model Solution Coupled to the Depletion Radius</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9de8</link>

We constrain the halo profiles outside the halo boundaries by solving for the matching profiles required by the halo model. In the halo model framework, the matter distribution in the Universe can be decomposed into the spatial distribution of halos convolved with their internal structures. This leads to a set of linear equations in Fourier space that uniquely determines the matching halo profiles for any given halo catalog. In this work, we construct three halo catalogs with different boundary definitions and solve for the matching profiles in each case using measurements of halo–matter and halo–halo power spectra. Our results show that for a given halo field, there is always a set of matching profiles to accurately reconstruct the input statistics of the matter field, even though it might be complex to model the profiles analytically. Comparing the solutions from different halo catalogs, we find that their mass distributions inside the inner depletion radii are nearly identical, while they deviate from each other on larger scales, with a larger boundary resulting in a more extended profile. For the depletion-radius-based catalog, the numerical solution agrees well with the Einasto profile. Coupling the Einasto profile with the depletion catalog, the resulting halo model can simultaneously predict the halo–matter power spectra to 10% and the matter–matter power spectrum to 5%, improving over conventional models in both interpretability and versatility. The conditions and limitations of using the Navarro–Frenk–White profile in the halo model are also discussed.

<title>The Solar and Geomagnetic Storms in 2024 May: A Flash Data Report</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9335</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In 2024 May, the scientific community observed intense solar eruptions that resulted in a great geomagnetic storm and auroral extensions, highlighting the need to document and quantify these events. This study mainly focuses on their quantification. The source active region (AR; NOAA Active Region 13664) evolved from 113 to 2761 millionths of the solar hemisphere between May 4 and 14. NOAA AR 13664’s magnetic free energy surpassed 1033 erg on May 7, triggering 12 X-class flares on May 8–15. Multiple interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) were produced from this AR, accelerating solar energetic particles toward Earth. According to satellite and interplanetary scintillation data, at least four ICMEs erupted from AR 13664, eventually overcoming and combining each other. The shock arrival at 17:05 UT on May 10 significantly compressed the magnetosphere down to ≈5.04 RE and triggered a deep Forbush Decrease. GOES satellite data and ground-based neutron monitors confirmed a ground-level enhancement from 2 UT to 10 UT on 2024 May 11. The ICMEs induced exceptional geomagnetic storms, peaking at a provisional Dst index of −412 nT at 2 UT on May 11, marking the sixth-largest storm since 1957. The AE and AL indices showed great auroral extensions that located the AE/AL stations into the polar cap. We gathered auroral records at that time and reconstructed the equatorward boundary of the visual auroral oval to 29.°8 invariant latitude. We compared naked-eye and camera auroral visibility, providing critical caveats on their difference. We also confirmed global disturbances of the storm-enhanced density of the ionosphere.

<title>Early Enrichment Population Theory at High Redshift</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9826</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9826</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An early enrichment population (EEP) has been theorized to produce the observed intracluster medium (ICM) metallicity of galaxy clusters. This population likely existed at high redshifts (z ∼ 10), relics of which we posit exist today as dwarf galaxies. Previous work has argued that the initial mass function (IMF) of the EEP must be flatter than those found at lower redshifts, but with considerable uncertainties. In this work, we present a more quantitative model for the EEP and demonstrate how observational constraints can be applied to the IMF using supernova Type Ia (SN Ia) rates, delay time distributions (DTDs), and the luminosity functions (LFs) of galaxy clusters. We determine best-fit values for the slope and mass break of the IMF by comparing IMFs from literature with observed DTDs and the low-luminosity component (M(R) > −12) of the Coma LF. We derive two best-fit IMFs, flatter than standard IMFs: (1) αlo = −0.13 ± 0.24 for 0.07 < M/M⊙ < 1.75 and αhi = 0.53 ± 0.01 for 1.75 < M/M⊙ < 150; and (2) αlo = 1.06 ± 0.11 for 0.07 < M/M⊙ < 6 and αhi = 0.53 ± 0.01 for 6 < M/M⊙ < 150. We compare these with sl-5 from M. Loewenstein (2013), with α = 0.5 for 0.07 < M/M⊙ < 8 and α = 0.3 for 8 < M/M⊙ < 150. This EEP model, along with stars formed at later times, can produce the observed ICM metallicity, is consistent with observations, and predicts a significant rise in the SN Ia rate at increasing redshift.

<title>The Effect of Donor Star Rejuvenation on Common Envelope Evolution</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9d3c</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In close binary star systems, common envelope evolution (CEE) may occur after a previous phase of mass transfer. Some isolated formation channels for double neutron star binaries suggest that the donor of CEE was the accretor of a previous phase of stable mass transfer. Accretion should substantially alter the structure of the donor, particularly by steepening the density gradient at the core-envelope interface and rejuvenating the star. We study the CEE of a donor that was the accretor of a previous phase of stable mass transfer and has a rejuvenated structure. We perform 3D hydrodynamics simulations of the CEE of an 18 M⊙ supergiant with a 1.4 M⊙ companion using rejuvenated and non-rejuvenated 1D stellar models for the donor. We compare the two simulations to characterize the effect of the rejuvenation on the outcome of the common envelope phase and the shape of the ejecta. We find that accounting for a previous phase of mass transfer reduces the duration of the inspiral phase by a factor of two, likely due to the different structures in the outer layers of the donor. In the rejuvenated case, the simulations show more equatorially concentrated and asymmetric ejecta, though both cases display evidence for the formation of a pressure-supported thick circumbinary disk. During the dynamical inspiral phase, the impact of rejuvenation on the unbinding of the envelope is unclear; we find that rejuvenation decreases the amount of unbound mass by 20%–40% depending on the energy criterion used.

<title>Magnetic Flux Emergence and Solar Eruptions in Partially Ionized Plasmas</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada0af</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have performed 3D MHD simulations to study the effect of partial ionization in the process of magnetic flux emergence in the Sun. In fact, we continue previous work, and we now focus (1) on the emergence of the magnetic fields above the solar photosphere and (2) on the eruptive activity that follows the emergence into the corona. We find that in the simulations with partial ionization (PI), the structure of the emerging field consists of arch-like field lines with very little twist since the axis of the initial rising field remains below the photosphere. The plasma inside the emerging volume is less dense, and it is moving faster compared to the fully ionized (FI) simulation. In both cases, new flux ropes (FR) are formed due to reconnection between emerging field lines, and they eventually erupt in an ejective manner toward the outer solar atmosphere. We are witnessing three major eruptions in both simulations. At least for the first eruption, the formation of the eruptive FR occurs in the low atmosphere in the FI case and at coronal heights in the PI case. Also, in the first PI eruption, part of the eruptive FR carries neutrals in the high atmosphere for a short period of time. Overall, the eruptions are relatively faster in the PI case, while a considerable amount of axial flux is found above the photosphere during the eruptions in both simulations.

<title>Time-dependent Acceleration and Escape of Charged Particles at Traveling Shocks in the Near-Sun Environment</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Current multi-spacecraft in situ measurements allow for the investigation of the time evolution of energetic particles at interplanetary shocks (IPs) at small (≲0.1 au) heliocentric distances. The energy spectrum of accelerated particles at IPs was shown by a previous 1D transport model that includes both self-excited plus preexisting turbulence and a term representing the escape of particles from the system to gradually steepen as a result of a finite acceleration-to-escape timescales ratio; such a model was found in excellent agreement with the entire sample of the ground-level enhancement spectra of solar cycle 23. We solve the time-dependent case of such a model in the case of diffusion dominated by preexisting turbulence. The average timescale for particle acceleration at various heliocentric distances, from 1 au down to the inner heliosphere (<0.1 au), is shorter than in the no-escape case, as higher energy particles have a shorter time to accelerate before completely leaving the system into the upstream medium. A simple scaling with time of the time-dependent spectrum is provided. We compare the “nose” structure at a few ∼100s keV protons first measured in situ by Parker Solar Probe in crossing the very fast 2022 September 5 shock at 0.07 au; we find that the nose is reasonably well explained by a lack of the highest energy particles not yet produced by the young shock by both our model and the no-escape version.

<title>Spectrum and Location of Ongoing Extreme Particle Acceleration in Cassiopeia A</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Young supernova remnants (SNRs) are believed to be the origin of energetic cosmic rays (CRs) below the “knee” of their spectrum at ∼3 PeV (1015 eV). Nevertheless, the precise location, duration, and operation of CR acceleration in young SNRs are open questions. Here, we report on multiepoch X-ray observations of Cassiopeia A (Cas A), a 350 yr old SNR, in the 15–50 keV band that probes the most energetic CR electrons. The observed X-ray flux decrease (15% ± 1% over 10 yr), contrary to the expected >90% decrease based on previous radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray observations, provides unambiguous evidence for CR electron acceleration operating in Cas A. A temporal model for the radio and X-ray data accounting for electron cooling and continuous injection finds that the freshly injected electron spectrum is significantly harder (exponential cutoff power-law index q = 2.15), and its cutoff energy is much higher (Ecut = 36 TeV), than the relic electron spectrum (q = 2.44 ± 0.03, Ecut = 4 ± 1 TeV). Both electron spectra are naturally explained by the recently developed modified nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration (mNLDSA) mechanism. The CR protons producing the observed gamma rays are likely accelerated at the same location by the same mechanism as the injected electrons. The Cas A observations and spectral modeling represent the first time radio, X-ray, gamma-ray, and CR spectra have been self-consistently tied to a specific acceleration mechanism—mNLDSA—in a young SNR.

<title>Unveiling the Dark Side of Ultraviolet/Optical Bright Galaxies: Optically Thick Dust Absorption</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Over the past decades, a population of galaxies invisible in optical/near-infrared (NIR), but bright at longer wavelengths, have been identified through color selections. These so-called optically faint/dark galaxies are considered to be massive quiescent galaxies or highly dust-attenuated galaxies. Having the entire galaxy obscured by dust, however, is likely an extreme case of the much more common occurrence of optically thin and thick absorption coexisting in the same system. With the power of JWST imaging, we are able to spatially resolve massive galaxies at z ∼ 3, accurately model their spectral energy distributions, and identify candidate optically thick substructures. We target galaxies with 10.3 and 2.5 < z < 3.5, and get 486 galaxies in Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey and Public Release Imaging for Extragalactic Research fields. Based on excess NIR luminosity, we identify 162 galaxies (∼33% of the parent sample) as candidate hosts of optically thick substructures. We then carry out spatially resolved spectral energy distribution modeling to explore the physical properties of those dark substructures and estimate the amount of optically thick obscuration. We find that optically thick dust is ubiquitous in normal massive galaxies with a wide variety of star formation rate (SFR) and morphology. 10%–20% of the stellar mass/SFR are unaccounted for in our selected galaxies, and the fraction is insensitive to stellar mass or SFR. The dark substructures are generally dustier than the rest of the galaxies and are irregularly distributed, arguing against an obscured active galactic nucleus as the source of the NIR excess. A correlation between the obscured luminosity and the presence of a recent starburst in the past ≲100 Myr is also observed.

<title>Search for and Analysis of Eclipsing Binaries in the LAMOST Medium-resolution Survey Field. I. R.A.: 23h01m51s, Decl.: +34°36′45″</title>

Eclipsing binaries (EBs) play an important astrophysical role in studying stellar properties and evolution. By analyzing photometric data in the the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) Medium-Resolution Survey field, R.A.: 23h01m51 00, decl.: +34 , 48 EBs are detected and two are newly discovered. This specific field has been observed 52 times by the LAMOST Medium-Resolution Survey DR 9, which facilitates a comprehensive analysis of the EBs. For EBs with LAMOST medium-resolution spectra, radial velocity curves were obtained, and their precise orbital parameters were determined by simultaneously analyzing photometric light curves and radial velocity curves. For the other EBs with only photometric light curves, we used the q-search or the temperature ratio method to determine their initial mass ratios and then determined the orbital parameters. It is found that 15 EBs belong to detached systems, one to semi-detached systems, and 32 to contact systems. Based on the O − C analysis for 26 EBs with sufficient eclipsing times, we found a long-term decrease in the orbital period of 11 EBs and a continuous increase of five EBs, which are due to the material transfer between the two components. The O − C curve of 1 EB shows a distinct periodic variation, which is caused by the light travel time effect, and the third body is likely to be a black hole. By applying the spectral subtraction method to 13 EBs with LAMOST medium-resolution spectra, 10 systems exhibit distinct Hα emission lines, in which one system exhibits double-peaked lines near phases 0.25 and 0.75, implying strong chromospheric activity. In the massluminosities and mass–radius distributions, most of the more massive components are less evolved than the less massive ones.

<title>JWST Discovery of a Very Fast Biconical Outflow of Warm Molecular Gas in the Nearby Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxy F08572+3915 NW</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium-Resolution Spectrometer observations of the nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) F08572+3915 NW. These integral field spectroscopic (IFS) data reveal a kpc-scale warm-molecular rotating disk and biconical outflow traced by the H2ν = 0–0 S(1), S(2), S(3), and S(5) rotational transitions. The outflow maintains a relatively constant median (maximum) projected velocity of 1100 km s−1 (3000 km s−1) out to ∼1.4 kpc from the nucleus. The outflowing H2 material is slightly warmer (640–700 K) than the rotating disk material (460–520 K), perhaps due to shock heating in the highly turbulent outflowing material. This outflow shares the same kinematics and orientation as the sub-kiloparsec scale warm H2 outflow traced by the rovibrational H2 lines in Keck AO near-infrared IFS data. However, this warm H2 outflow is significantly faster than the sub-kiloparsec-scale cold molecular outflow derived from multi-transition far-infrared OH observations with Herschel and the greater than or equivalent to kiloparsec-scale cold molecular outflow mapped by millimeter-wave interferometric CO 1–0 observations with IRAM-PdBI and NOEMA. The new JWST data bolster the scenario where the buried quasar in this ULIRG is excavating the dust screen, accelerating perhaps as much as 60% of the dusty warm molecular material to velocities beyond the escape velocity, and thus influencing the evolution of the host galaxy.

<title>Alignment Parameters: Quantifying Dense Core Alignment in Star-forming Regions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent high-resolution observations at millimeter (mm) and submillimeter wavelengths reveal a diverse spatial distribution for subparsec-scale dense cores within star-forming regions, ranging from clustered to aligned arrangements. To address the increasing volume of observational and simulation data, we introduce “alignment parameters” as a quantitative and reproducible method to automatically assess core alignment. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of these parameters by applying them to artificial test clumps and comparing the results with labels from visual inspection. A threshold value is then proposed to differentiate between “clustered” and “aligned” categories. Subsequently, we apply these parameters to dense cores identified from a sample of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array 1.3 mm dust continuum images in high-mass star-forming regions. Analysis exploring correlations between alignment parameters and clump properties rules out the presence of a moderate or strong correlation, indicating that clump properties do not appear to strongly influence the outcome of fragmentation. One possible explanation for this is that the fragmentation process is chaotic, meaning that small variations in initial conditions can lead to significant differences in fragmentation outcomes, thus obscuring any direct link between clump properties and core alignment/distribution.

<title>From Halos to Galaxies. X. Decoding Galaxy SEDs with Physical Priors and Accurate Star Formation History Reconstruction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The spectral energy distribution (SED) of galaxies is essential for deriving fundamental properties like stellar mass and star formation history (SFH). However, conventional methods, including both parametric and nonparametric approaches, often fail to accurately recover the observed cosmic star formation rate (SFR) density due to oversimplified or unrealistic assumptions about SFH and their inability to account for the complex SFH variations across different galaxy populations. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach that improves galaxy broadband SED analysis by incorporating physical priors derived from hydrodynamical simulations. Tests using IllustrisTNG simulations demonstrate that our method can reliably determine galaxy physical properties from broadband photometry, including stellar mass within 0.05 dex, current SFR within 0.3 dex, and fractional stellar formation time within 0.2 dex, with a negligible fraction of catastrophic failures. When applied to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) main photometric galaxy sample with spectroscopic redshift, our estimates of stellar mass and SFR are consistent with the widely used MPA-JHU and GSWLC catalogs. Notably, using the derived SFHs of individual SDSS galaxies, we estimate the cosmic SFR density and stellar mass density with remarkable consistency to direct observations up to z ~ 6. This demonstrates a significant advancement in deriving SFHs from SEDs that closely align with observational data. Consequently, our method can reliably recover observed spectral indices such as Dn(4000) and HδA by synthesizing the full spectra of galaxies using the estimated SFHs and metal enrichment histories, relying solely on broadband photometry as input. Furthermore, this method is extremely computationally efficient compared to conventional approaches.

<title>Examining Turbulence in Galactic Molecular Clouds. I. A Statistical Analysis of Velocity Structures</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a systematic analysis of the velocity structure functions (VSFs) of 167 molecular clouds with angular sizes greater than ~176 arcmin2 in three sectors of the Galactic midplane. We calculated the first-to-third-order VSFs and found that 60% of the VSFs exhibit power-law distributions. The relative power-law exponents are consistent with predictions from intermittent turbulence models. Column density weighting reduces the proportion of power-law VSFs and steepens the VSF slopes, implying a reduction of turbulent energy in high-density regions. All clouds show small-scale intermittency, with slightly stronger intermittency in those molecular clouds showing “none” power-law VSFs. Negative VSF exponents that may indicate gravitational collapse are not observed in our sample. The scaling exponents of the observed VSFs do not correlate with the virial parameters of the molecular clouds. These two observations suggest that gravity-dominated scales in molecular clouds still need further investigation. Consistent VSF scaling exponents for the molecular clouds with significant power-law VSFs suggest large-scale external driving of turbulence in these molecular clouds. However, the driving mechanisms are likely not universal, as the power-law scaling coefficients in our results show relatively large scatter. The fact that nearly 40% of the VSFs deviate to some extent from power-law distributions suggests that the influence of local environments on the internal turbulence of molecular clouds may not be negligible.

Ultraviolet absorption line spectroscopy is a sensitive diagnostic for the properties of interstellar and circumgalactic gas. Down-the-barrel observations, where the absorption is measured against the galaxy itself, are commonly used to study feedback from galactic outflows and to make predictions about the leakage of H i ionizing photons into the intergalactic medium. Nonetheless, the interpretation of these observations is challenging, and observational compromises are often made in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, spectral resolution, or the use of stacking analyses. In this paper, we present a novel quantitative assessment of UV absorption line measurement techniques by using mock observations of a hydrodynamical simulation. We use a simulated galaxy to create 22,500 spectra in the commonly used Si ii lines while also modeling the signal-to-noise ratio and spectral resolution of recent rest-frame UV galaxy surveys at both high and low redshifts. We show that the residual flux of absorption features is easily overestimated for single line measurements and for stacked spectra. Additionally, we explore the robustness of the partial covering model for estimating column densities from spectra and find underpredictions on an average of 1.25 dex. We show that the underprediction is likely caused by high-column-density sight lines that are optically thick to dust making them invisible in UV spectra.

Identifying the source regions of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is crucial for understanding their origins and improving space weather forecasting. We present an automated algorithm for matching CMEs detected by the Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph with their source active regions, specifically Space Weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARPs), between 2010 May and 2019 January. Our method uses posteruptive signatures, including flares and coronal dimmings, to associate CMEs with potential source regions. Out of 4190 CMEs, we successfully match 1132, achieving a recall rate of ~57% for frontside events. We find that the algorithm performs better for complex SHARP regions containing multiple NOAA regions and for faster CMEs, consistent with expectations that more energetic events produce stronger eruption signatures. We find that CME–flare association rates increase with flare intensity, aligning with previous studies. While our approach has limitations, such as focusing exclusively on SHARP regions and relying on a limited set of posteruptive signatures, it significantly reduces the time required for CME source identification while providing transparent, reproducible results. We encourage the solar physics community to build upon this work, developing improved automated tools for CME source identification. The resulting catalog of CME–source region associations is made publicly available, offering a valuable resource for statistical studies and machine learning applications in solar physics and space weather forecasting.

<title>Observational Study of Recurrent Jets: Evolution of Magnetic Flux, Current, and Helicity</title>

We observed three recurrent blowout jets in an active region with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Using Helioseismic Magnetic Imager data we found that the magnetic flux of an emerging negative pole increases steadily before declining just as the jets erupt. Certain physical quantities, such as the total unsigned vertical current, align with the periodicity of the jets. The differential affine velocity of vector magnetograms reveals strong shear around the negative pole. The Doppler velocity map, calculated from the Hα spectra observed by the Chinese Hα Solar Explorer, shows upflows with large initial velocity before they can be observed by AIA. The magnetic field derived from the nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) model suggests a topology akin to a fan–spine structure, consistent with AIA images. We calculated the evolution of the volumetric helicity ratio using the NLFFF model and found its phase aligns with the jet flux in AIA 171 Å. These results suggest that recurrent jets may be triggered by the accumulation and release of energy and helicity, driven by emergence, shearing, and cancellation of photospheric magnetic field.

<title>Comparison of Bar Formation Mechanisms. I. Does a Tidally Induced Bar Rotate Slower than an Internally Induced Bar?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Galactic bars can form via the internal bar instability or external tidal perturbations by other galaxies. We systematically compare the properties of the bars formed through the two mechanisms with a series of controlled N-body simulations that form bars through internal or external mechanisms. We create three disk galaxy models with different dynamical “hotness” and evolve them in isolation and under flyby interactions. In the cold- and warm-disk models, where bars can form spontaneously in isolation, tidally induced bars are promoted to a more “advanced” evolutionary stage. However, these bars have similar pattern speeds to those formed spontaneously within the same disk. Bars formed from both mechanisms have similar distributions in pattern-speed–bar-strength (Ωp − A2) space and exhibit comparable ratios of corotation radius to bar length ( ). Dynamical analyses suggest that the inner stellar disk loses the same amount of angular momentum, irrespective of the presence or intensity of the perturbation, which possibly explains the resemblance between tidally and spontaneously formed bars. In the hot-disk model, which avoids the internal bar instability in isolation, a bar forms only under perturbations and rotates more slowly than those in the cold and warm disks. Thus, if “tidally induced bars” refer exclusively to those in galaxies that are otherwise stable against bar instability, they indeed rotate slower than internally induced ones. However, the pattern speed difference is due to the difference in the internal properties of the bar host galaxies, not the different formation mechanisms.

<title>Investigating the Lower Limit of Metallicity for the Galactic Thin Disk</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We explore the metal-poor regime of the Galactic disk on the distribution of stars in the [α/M]–Vϕ plane, to identify the most metal-poor thin disk (MPTnD) stars belonging to the low-α sequence. Chemical abundances and velocities of sample stars are either taken or derived from APOGEE DR17 and Gaia DR3 catalogs. We find the existence of a well-separated extension of the kinematically thin disk stars in the metallicity range of −1.2 < [M/H] < −0.8 dex. Based on two-by-two distributions of [Mg/Mn], [Al/Fe] and [C+N/Fe], we further confirmed 56 high-possibility metal-poor thin disk (HP-MPTnD) giant stars and suggested the lower metallicity limit of the thin disk below −0.95 dex. A comparative analysis of the HP-MPTnD sample with other Galactic components revealed its chemo-dynamical similarities with canonical thin disk stars. These low-α metal-poor stars are predominantly located in the outer disk region and formed in the early stage of the formation of thin disk. Their existence provides compelling support for the two-infall model of the Milky Way's disk formation. Moreover, these stars impose observational constraints on the timing and metallicity of the second gas infall event.

<title>Nuclear and Star Formation Activities in Nearby Galaxies: Roles of Gas Supply and Active Galactic Nucleus Feedback</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We analyze a sample of ~113,000 galaxies (z < 0.3) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, divided into star-forming, composite, Seyfert, and LINER types, to explore the relationships between UV-to-optical colors (u – r), star formation rates (SFRs), specific SFRs (sSFRs), stellar velocity dispersions (σ*), mass accretion rates onto the black hole ( ), and Eddington ratios. Star-forming galaxies predominantly feature young, blue stars along the main-sequence (MS) line, while composite, Seyfert, and LINER galaxies deviate from this line, displaying progressively older stellar populations and lower SFRs. The and Eddington ratios are highest in Seyfert galaxies, moderate in composite galaxies, and lowest in LINERs, with higher ratios associated with bluer colors, indicating a younger stellar population and stronger active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity. These trends suggest a strong correlation between sSFRs and Eddington ratios, highlighting a close connection between AGN and star formation activities. These results may imply an evolutionary sequence where galaxies transition from blue star-forming galaxies to red LINERs, passing through the composite and Seyfert phases, driven primarily by gas supply, with AGN feedback playing a secondary role. While both the radio luminosities (L1.4 GHz) and Eddington ratios correlate with SFRs, their trends differ on the SFR−stellar-mass (M*) plane, with the radio luminosities increasing with stellar mass along the MS line and no direct connection between the radio luminosities and Eddington ratios. These findings may provide new insights into the interplay between star formation, AGN activity, and radio emission in galaxies, shedding light on their evolutionary pathways.

<title>Characterizing Multiband Optical Emission and Variability of 1ES 1215+303 on Diverse Timescales</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study presents analyses of the optical variability of the 1ES 1215+303 on diverse timescales using multiband observations, including observations in the optical BVRI bands carried out with the 0.6 and 1.0 m telescopes located at the Tübitak National Observatory (TUG) from 2022 to 2024 and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) gri data from 2018 to 2023. Investigation of variability on intraday timescales revealed amplitudes of 4.0% and 5.6% on two nights, with a calculated duty cycle of 63%. We determined a minimum timescale of ~92 minutes from these observations, leading us to limit the radius for the optical emission region and the mass of the black hole. The blazar exhibits moderate short- and long-term variability, with variability amplitudes reaching up to 120% and decreasing as the wavelength shortens. Correlation analysis revealed a strong correlation between the optical multiband emissions without any time lag. Analysis of 109 nightly spectral energy distributions yielded spectral indices ranging from 0.772 to 1.413. The consistent trend of both spectral indices and color with respect to brightness suggests a mild bluer when brighter trend persists throughout the observation period, in contrast to the intraday timescale. Utilizing the weighted wavelet z-transform and Lomb–Scargle methods, we analyzed recurrent optical emission patterns on the combined R-band light curves from TUG, ZTF, and Tuorla observations, revealing a quasiperiodic signal at around 1000 days and a secondary signal at approximately 300 days. These signals were found to be insignificant after accounting for the stochastic process and the trial factor.

<title>Local 2D Simulations of the Ignition of a Helium Shell Detonation on a White Dwarf by an Impacting Stream</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada034</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ada034</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The double detonation model is one of the prevalent explosion mechanisms of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) wherein an outer helium shell detonation triggers a core detonation in the white dwarf (WD). The dynamically driven double degenerate double detonation (D6) is the double detonation of the more massive WD in a binary WD system where the localized impact of the mass transfer stream from the companion sets off the initial helium shell detonation. To have high numerical resolution and control over the stream parameters, we have implemented a study of the local interaction of the stream with the WD surface in 2D. In cases with lower base density of the shell, the stream's impact can cause surface detonation soon after first impact. With higher base densities, after the stream hits the surface, hot material flows around the star and interacts with the incoming stream to produce a denser and narrower impact. Our results therefore show that (1) a directly impacting stream for both a relatively high resolution and for a range of stream parameters can produce a surface detonation, (2) thinner helium shells ignite more promptly via impact, doing so sooner, and (3) there are lower limits on ignition in both shell density and incoming stream speed with lower limits on density being well below those shown by other work to be required for normal appearing SN Ia. This supports stream ignition and therefore the D6 scenario, as a viable mechanism for normal SNe Ia.

<title>Advancing CO2 ++ Modeling in the Martian Dayside Ionosphere: Insights from Natural Lifetime Analysis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The molecular dication CO2++ has, as previously reported, been detected in the Martian ionosphere by the Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer on the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission. Photochemical models have also been developed to reproduce the CO2++ density in the Martian dayside ionosphere but underestimate significantly the observations. In this study, we examine the influence of the CO2++ natural lifetime against spontaneous dissociation on its modeled density. We show that extending the assumed CO2++ lifetime significantly reduces the discrepancy between the photochemical model predictions and MAVEN observations. Specifically, when treating CO2++ as stable against natural dissociation, instead of invoking a lifetime of 4 s as done in previous studies, the data-to-model ratio comes close to unity throughout the altitude range 160–220 km. We argue that stability of CO2++ against natural dissociation does not necessarily conflict with results from a frequently cited experimental investigation. Our study provides new insights for advancing photochemical modeling of the Martian ionosphere and underscores the need for further laboratory measurements targeting fundamental properties of doubly charged ions.

<title>Cosmic Chronometers, Pantheon+ Supernovae, and Quasars Favor Coasting Cosmologies over the Flat ΛCDM Model</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We test and compare coasting cosmological models with curvature parameters in units and the flat ΛCDM model by fitting them to cosmic chronometers (CCs), the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe), and standardized quasars (QSOs). We used the emcee code for fitting CC data, a custom Markov Chain Monte Carlo implementation for SNe and QSOs, and Anderson–Darling tests for normality on normalized residuals for model comparison. Best-fit parameters are presented, constrained by data within redshift ranges z ≤ 2 for CCs, z ≤ 2.3 for SNe, and z ≤ 7.54 for QSOs. Coasting models, particularly the flat coasting model, are generally favored over the flat ΛCDM model. The overfitting of the flat ΛCDM model to Pantheon+ SNe and the large intrinsic scatter in QSO data suggest a need to refine error estimates in these data sets. We also highlight the seemingly fine-tuned nature of either the CC data or Ωm,0 in the flat ΛCDM model to an H1 = H0 coincidence when fitting H(z) = H1z + H0, a natural feature of coasting models.

<title>PHAST. The Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Southern Treasury. I. Ultraviolet and Optical Photometry of over 90 Million Stars in M31</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Southern Treasury (PHAST) is a large 195-orbit Hubble Space Telescope program imaging ∼0.45 deg2 of the southern half of M31's star-forming disk at optical and near-ultraviolet (NUV) wavelengths. The PHAST survey area extends the northern coverage of the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) down to the southern half of M31, covering out to a radius of ∼13 kpc along the southern major axis and in total ∼two-thirds of M31's star-forming disk. This new legacy imaging yields stellar photometry of over 90 million resolved stars using the Advanced Camera for Surveys in the optical (F475W and F814W), and the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) in the NUV (F275W and F336W). The photometry is derived using all overlapping exposures across all bands, and achieves a 50% completeness-limited depth of F475W ∼ 27.7 in the lowest surface density regions of the outer disk and F475W ∼ 26.0 in the most crowded, high surface brightness regions near M31's bulge. We provide extensive analysis of the data quality, including artificial star tests to quantify completeness, photometric uncertainties, and flux biases, all of which vary due to the background source density and the number of overlapping exposures. We also present seamless population maps of the entire M31 disk, which show relatively well-mixed distributions for stellar populations older than 1–2 Gyr, and highly structured distributions for younger populations. The combined PHAST + PHAT photometry catalog of ∼0.2 billion stars is the largest ever produced for equidistant sources and is available for public download by the community.

<title>Recovering Pulsar Periodicity from Time-of-arrival Data by Finding the Shortest Vector in a Lattice</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The strict periodicity of pulsars is one of the primary ways through which their nature and environment can be studied, and it has also enabled precision tests of general relativity and studies of nanohertz gravitational waves using pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). Identifying such a periodicity from a discrete set of arrival times is a difficult algorithmic problem, In particular when the pulsar is in a binary system. This challenge is especially acute in γ-ray pulsar astronomy, as there are hundreds of unassociated Fermi-LAT sources that may be produced by γ-ray emission from unknown pulsars. Recovering their timing solutions will help reveal their properties and may allow them to be added to PTAs. The same issue arises when attempting to recover a strict periodicity for repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs). Such a detection would be a major breakthrough, providing us with the FRB source’s age, magnetic field, and binary orbit. The problem of recovering a timing solution from sparse time-of-arrival data is currently unsolvable for pulsars in unknown binary systems, and incredibly hard even for isolated pulsars. In this paper, we frame the timing recovery problem as the problem of finding a short vector in a lattice and obtain the solution using off-the-shelf lattice reduction and sieving techniques. As a proof of concept, we solve PSR J0318+0253, a millisecond γ-ray pulsar discovered by FAST in a γ-ray-directed search, in a few CPU minutes. We discuss the assumptions of the standard lattice techniques and quantify their performance and limitations.

<title>Suzaku Observations of the Cold Front in A3667: A Nonequilibrium Ionization State of the Intracluster Medium</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a systematic study of the thermodynamic properties of the intracluster medium (ICM), including the plasma conditions in the ICM, in the merging galaxy cluster A3667 using Suzaku. We analyze the X-ray spectra of the ICM between the northwestern and the southeastern radio relics across a prominent cold front in A3667 to search for the ICM in a nonequilibrium ionization (NEI) state. We find that the ICM inside the cold front exhibits an NEI state with an ionization parameter of (2.2 ± 0.4) × 1011 s cm−3 at the 90% confidence level, which is lower than that expected from a collisional ionization equilibrium state of the ICM (i.e., net > 1012 s cm−3). The timescale calculated from the ionization parameter of the ICM inside the cold front is , which is much shorter than the thermal equilibration timescale. A weak transonic sloshing motion might explain the possibility that the ICM inside the cold front of A3667 is in the NEI state. In addition, the NEI state of the ICM in A3667 seems to be associated with the elongated radio halo bridging the region between the northwestern radio relic and the prominent cold front in A3667 across the cluster center.

<title>The Effect of Stellar Evolution on Dispersal of Protoplanetary Disks: Disk Fraction in Star-forming Regions</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9746</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the effect of stellar evolution on the dispersal of protoplanetary disks by performing one-dimensional simulations of long-term disk evolution. Our simulations include viscous disk accretion, magnetohydrodynamic winds, and photoevaporation as important disk dispersal processes. We consider a wide range of stellar mass of 0.1–7 M⊙ and incorporate the luminosity evolution of the central star. For solar-mass stars, stellar evolution delays the disk dispersal time as the far-ultraviolet (FUV) luminosity decreases toward the main sequence. In the case of intermediate-mass stars, the FUV luminosity increases significantly over a few million years, driving strong photoevaporation and enhancing disk mass loss during the later stages of disk evolution. This highlights the limitations of assuming a constant FUV luminosity throughout a simulation. Photoevaporation primarily impacts the outer regions of the disk and is the dominant disk dispersal process in the late evolutionary stage. Based on the results of a large set of simulations, we study the evolution of a population of star–disk systems and derive the disk fraction as a function of time. We demonstrate that the inclusion of stellar luminosity evolution can alter the disk fraction by several tens of percent, bringing the simulations into closer agreement with recent observations. We argue that it is important to include the stellar luminosity evolution in simulations of the long-term dispersal of protoplanetary disks.

<title>Increased Surface Temperatures of Habitable White Dwarf Worlds Relative to Main-sequence Exoplanets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Discoveries of giant planet candidates orbiting white dwarf (WD) stars and the demonstrated capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope bring the possibility of detecting rocky planets in the habitable zones (HZs) of WDs into pertinent focus. We present simulations of an aqua planet with an Earth-like atmospheric composition and incident stellar insolation orbiting in the HZ of two different types of stars—a 5000 K WD and main-sequence K-dwarf star Kepler-62 (K62) with a similar effective temperature—and identify the mechanisms responsible for the two differing planetary climates. The synchronously rotating WD planet's global mean surface temperature is 25 K higher than that of the synchronously rotating planet orbiting K62, due to its much faster (10 hr) rotation and orbital period. This ultrafast rotation generates strong zonal winds and meridional flux of zonal momentum, stretching out and homogenizing the scale of atmospheric circulation, and preventing an equivalent buildup of thick, liquid water clouds on the dayside of the planet compared to the synchronous planet orbiting K62, while also transporting heat equatorward from higher latitudes. White dwarfs may therefore present amenable environments for life on planets formed within or migrated to their HZs, generating warmer surface environments than those of planets with main-sequence hosts to compensate for an ever shrinking incident stellar flux.

<title>Some Stars Fade Quietly: Varied Supernova Explosion Outcomes and Their Effects on the Multiphase Interstellar Medium</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad98ea</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present results from galaxy evolution simulations with a multiphase interstellar medium (ISM), a mass resolution of 4 M⊙, and a spatial resolution of 0.5 pc. These simulations include a resolved stellar stellar feedback model. Our fiducial run WLM-fid adopts 1051 erg for the supernova (SN) energy. Among the remaining seven simulations, there are two runs where we vary this number by fixing the energy at 1050 erg and 1052 erg (WLM-1e50 and WLM-1e52). Additionally, we carry out one run with variable SN-energy (WLM-variable) and run two simulations where only 10% or 60% of stars explode as SNe with 1051 erg, while the remaining stars do not explode (WLM-60prob and WLM-10prob). We find that the variation in the SN energy, has only minor effects: the star formation rate changes by roughly a factor of 2 compared to WLM-fid, and the strength of the galactic outflows in mass and energy is reduced by 30%, with typical values of ηm ∼ 0.1 and ηe ∼ 0.05 (at a height of 3 kpc after the hot wind is fully decoupled from the galactic ISM). In contrast, the increase and decrease in the canonical SN-energy have a clear impact on the phase structure, with loading factors that are at least 10 times lower/higher and a clear change in the phase structure (the energy loading is normalized self-consistently to the initial mass function averaged explosion energy). We conclude that these modulations are driven not by the minor change in SN-energy but rather by the likelihood of whether or not an event occurs when variable SN energies are applied.

<title>Star-forming Nuclear Clusters in Dwarf Galaxies Mimicking Active Galactic Nucleus Signatures in the Mid-infrared</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Effectively finding and identifying active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dwarf galaxies is an important step in studying black hole formation and evolution. In this work, we examine four mid-infrared (IR)-selected AGN candidates in dwarf galaxies with stellar masses between M⋆ ~ 108 and 109 M⊙ and find that the galaxies are host to nuclear star clusters (NSCs) that are notably rare in how young and massive they are. We perform photometric measurements on the central star clusters in our target galaxies using Hubble Space Telescope optical and near-IR imaging and compare their observed properties to models of stellar population evolution. We find that these galaxies are host to very massive (~107 M⊙), extremely young (≲8 Myr), and dusty (0.6 ≲ Av ≲ 1.8) NSCs. Our results indicate that these galactic nuclei have ongoing star formation, are still at least partially obscured by clouds of gas and dust, and are most likely producing the extremely red AGN-like mid-IR colors. Moreover, prior work has shown that these galaxies do not exhibit X-ray or optical AGN signatures. Therefore, we recommend caution when using mid-IR color–color diagnostics for AGN selection in dwarf galaxies, since, as directly exemplified in this sample, they can be contaminated by massive star clusters with ongoing star formation.

<title>Tempered Superdiffusive Shock Acceleration at a Perpendicular Shock</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad98f2</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A theory for steady-state tempered superdiffusive shock acceleration of energetic particles at a plane perpendicular shock is presented that involves solving analytically a tempered fractional Parker transport equation for perpendicular transport in quasi-2D turbulence. The main predictions of the theory are as follows: (i) Tempered perpendicular superdiffusion (tempered Lévy flights) upstream reduces the effectiveness of classical perpendicular superdiffusion (standard Lévy flights) through a transition toward normal perpendicular diffusion when the particle transport distance upstream surpasses a critical spatial scale. Consequently, the accelerated particle distribution upstream decays spatially as a stretched exponential close to the shock that becomes a power law farther upstream under some conditions (superdiffusion), followed by an exponential rollover (transition to normal diffusion); (ii) Downstream, the accelerated particle distribution for tempered superdiffusion converges to a uniform distribution closer to the shock because of a stronger decay close to the shock compared to classical superdiffusion, and a shift of the peak in the distribution at the shock to just downstream of the shock occurs under some conditions; (iii) The accelerated power-law momentum spectrum at the shock is modulated upstream by the incoming solar wind flow to be a hardened power law instead of featuring an exponential rollover at lower particle momenta as for classical diffusive shock acceleration; and (iv) Tempered superdiffusive shock acceleration tends to be more efficient compared to standard superdiffusive shock acceleration.

In ΛCDM cosmology, galaxies form and evolve in their host dark matter (DM) halos. Halo mass is crucial for understanding the halo–galaxy connection. The abundance-matching (AM) technique has been widely used to derive the halo masses of galaxy groups. However, the quenching of the central galaxy can decouple the coevolution of its stellar mass and DM halo mass. Different halo assembly histories can also result in significantly different final stellar masses of the central galaxies. These processes can introduce substantial uncertainties into the halo masses derived from the AM method, particularly leading to a systematic bias between groups with star-forming centrals (blue groups) and passive centrals (red groups). To improve this, we have developed a new machine learning (ML) algorithm that accounts for these effects and is trained on simulations. Our results show that the ML method eliminates the systematic bias in the derived halo masses for blue and red groups and is, on average, ~one-third more accurate than the AM method. With careful calibrations of observable quantities from simulations and observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we apply our ML model to the SDSS groups to derive their halo masses down to 1011.5M⊙ or even lower. The derived SDSS group halo mass function agrees well with the theoretical predictions, and the derived stellar-to-halo mass relations for both the red and blue groups match well with those obtained from direct weak-lensing measurements. These new halo mass estimates enable more accurate investigation of the galaxy–halo connection and the role of halos in galaxy evolution.

<title>The Importance of Gas Starvation in Driving Satellite Quenching in Galaxy Groups at z ~ 0.8</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9aa4</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present results from a Keck/DEIMOS survey to study satellite quenching in group environments at z ~ 0.8 within the Extended Groth Strip (EGS). We target 11 groups in the EGS with extended X-ray emission. We obtain high-quality spectroscopic redshifts for group member candidates, extending to depths over 1 order of magnitude fainter than existing DEEP2/DEEP3 spectroscopy. This depth enables the first spectroscopic measurement of the satellite quiescent fraction down to stellar masses of ~109.5M⊙ at this redshift. By combining an infall-based environmental quenching model, constrained by the observed quiescent fractions, with infall histories of simulated groups from the IllustrisTNG100-1-Dark simulation, we estimate environmental quenching timescales (τquench) for the observed group population. At high stellar masses (M⋆ = 1010.5M⊙) we find that Gyr, which is consistent with previous estimates at this epoch. At lower stellar masses (M⋆ = 109.5M⊙), we find that Gyr, which is shorter than prior estimates from photometry-based investigations. These timescales are consistent with satellite quenching via starvation, provided the hot gas envelope of infalling satellites is not stripped away. We find that the evolution in the quenching timescale between 0 <1 aligns with the evolution in the dynamical time of the host halo and the total cold gas depletion time. This suggests that the doubling of the quenching timescale in groups since z ~ 1 could be related to the dynamical evolution of groups or a decrease in quenching efficiency via starvation with decreasing redshift.

<title>Repeating Partial Tidal Encounters of Sun-like Stars Leading to Their Complete Disruption</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Stars grazing supermassive black holes on bound orbits may produce periodic flares over many passages, known as repeating partial tidal disruption events (TDEs). Here, we present 3D hydrodynamic simulations of Sun-like stars over multiple tidal encounters. The star is significantly restructured and becomes less concentrated as a result of mass loss and tidal heating. The vulnerability to mass loss depends sensitively on the stellar density structure, and the strong correlation between the fractional mass loss ΔM/M* and the ratio of the central and average density , which was initially derived in disruption simulations of main-sequence stars, also applies for stars strongly reshaped by tides. Over multiple orbits, the star loses progressively more mass in each encounter and is doomed to a complete disruption. Throughout its lifetime, the star may produce numerous weak flares (depending on the initial impact parameter), followed by a couple of luminous flares whose brightness increases exponentially. Flux-limited surveys are heavily biased toward the brightest flares, which may appear similar to the flare produced by the same star undergoing a full disruption on its first tidal encounter. This places new challenges on constraining the intrinsic TDE rates, which need to take repeating TDEs into account. Other types of stars with different initial density structures (e.g., evolved stars with massive cores) follow distinct evolution tracks, which might explain the diversity of the long-term luminosity evolution seen in recently uncovered repeaters.

<title>Low-energy Injection and Nonthermal Particle Acceleration in Relativistic Magnetic Turbulence</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b12</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Relativistic magnetic turbulence has been proposed as a process for producing nonthermal particles in high-energy astrophysics. The particle energization may be contributed by both magnetic reconnection and turbulent fluctuations, but their interplay is poorly understood. It has been suggested that during magnetic reconnection the parallel electric field dominates the particle acceleration up to the lower bound of the power-law particle spectrum, but recent studies show that electric fields perpendicular to the magnetic field can play an important, if not dominant role. In this study, we carry out two-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of magnetically dominated decaying turbulence in a relativistic pair plasma. For a fixed magnetization parameter σ0 = 20, we find that the injection energy εinj converges with increasing domain size to εinj ≃ 10 mec2. In contrast, the power-law index, the cut-off energy, and the power-law extent increase steadily with domain size. We trace a large number of particles and evaluate the contributions of the work done by the parallel (W∥) and perpendicular (W⊥) electric fields during both the injection phase and the postinjection phase. We find that during the injection phase, the W⊥ contribution increases with domain size, suggesting that it may eventually dominate injection for a sufficiently large domain. In contrast, on average, both components contribute equally during the postinjection phase, insensitive to the domain size. For high energy (ε ≫ εinj) particles, W⊥ dominates the subsequent energization. These findings may improve our understanding of nonthermal particles and their emissions in astrophysical plasmas.

<title>Simultaneous Multiband Photometry of the Early Optical Afterglow of GRB 240825A with Mephisto</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous transients in the Universe. The interaction of the relativistic jet with the circumburst medium produces an afterglow and generates multiwavelength emission. In this work, we present simultaneous multiband photometry of GRB 240825A with the Multi-channel Photometric Survey Telescope (Mephisto) and analyze its temporal and spectral properties. The measurement began 128 s after the GRB trigger and continued until the fourth day, when the afterglow essentially diminished and the measured brightness was close to that of the host galaxy. Based on the multiband light curves in the uvgriz bands, we find that the optical flux density satisfies Fν,obs ∝ t−1.34ν−2.48 with a spectral index of 2.48, much larger than those of most other GRBs. To reconcile the measured much softer spectral energy distribution (SED) with that predicted by the standard afterglow model, an extra host-galaxy extinction of EB−V ∼ (0.37–0.57) mag is required. We interpreted this excess as arising from a dense circumburst medium. We further find that the SED of the optical afterglow hardened as the afterglow decayed and the color excess EB−V decreased ∼0.26 mag from 100 to 3000 s after the GRB trigger. Finally, we analyze the properties of the host galaxy of GRB 240825A based on data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Pan-STARRS survey, and the HSC-SSP survey. For a host redshift of z = 0.659, the stellar mass and star formation rate of the host galaxy are estimated to be and , respectively, pointing to a gas-rich, star-forming, medium-size galaxy.

<title>Dynamics of Small, Constant-size Particles in a Protoplanetary Disk with an Embedded Protoplanet</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Hydrodynamical simulations of protoplanetary disk dynamics are useful tools for understanding the formation of planetary systems, including our own. Approximations are necessary to make these simulations computationally tractable. A common assumption when simulating dust fluids is that of a constant Stokes number, a dimensionless number that characterizes the interaction between a particle and the surrounding gas. Constant Stokes number is not a good approximation in regions of the disk where the gas density changes significantly, such as near a planet-induced gap. In this paper, we relax the assumption of a constant Stokes number in the popular FARGO3D code using semianalytic equations for the drag force on dust particles, which enables an assumption of constant particle size instead. We explore the effect this change has on disk morphology and particle fluxes across the gap for both outward- and inward-drifting particles. The assumption of constant particle size, rather than constant Stokes number, is shown to make a significant difference in some cases, emphasizing the importance of the more accurate treatment.

<title>An Indication of Gas Inflow in Clumpy Star-forming Galaxies near z ∼ 1: Lower Gas-phase Metallicities in Clumpy Galaxies Compared to Nonclumpy Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Despite the ubiquity of clumpy star-forming galaxies at high-redshift, the origin of clumps are still largely unconstrained due to the limited observations that can validate the mechanisms for clump formation. We postulate that if clumps form due to the accretion of metal-poor gas that leads to violent disk instability, clumpy galaxies should have lower gas-phase metallicities compared to nonclumpy galaxies. In this work, we obtain the near-infrared spectrum for 42 clumpy and nonclumpy star-forming galaxies of similar masses, star formation rates, and colors at z ≈ 0.7 using the Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph (GNIRS) and infer their gas-phase metallicity from the [N ii]λ6584 and Hα line ratio. We find that clumpy galaxies have lower metallicities compared to nonclumpy galaxies, with an offset in the weighted average metallicity of 0.07 ± 0.02 dex. We also find an offset of 0.06 ± 0.02 dex between clumpy and nonclumpy galaxies in a comparable sample of 23 star-forming galaxies at z ≈ 1.5 using existing data from the FMOS-COSMOS survey. Similarly, lower [N ii]λ6584/Hα ratios are typically found in galaxies that have more of their UVrest luminosity originating from clumps, suggesting that clumpier galaxies are more metal-poor. We also derive the intrinsic velocity dispersion and line-of-sight rotational velocity for galaxies from the GNIRS sample. The majority of galaxies have σ0/vc ≈ 0.2, with no significant difference between clumpy and nonclumpy galaxies. Our result indicates that clump formation may be related to the inflow of metal-poor gas; however, the process that forms them does not necessarily require significant, long-term kinematic instability in the disk.

<title>Deconstructing the Properties of Solar Super Active Region 13664 in the Context of the Historic Geomagnetic Storm of 2024 May 10–11</title>

Active regions (ARs) are sites of strong magnetic fields on the solar surface whose size can be several times that of Earth. They spawn dynamic activity, sometimes resulting in severe space weather. Some ARs characterized by extraordinary magnetic properties and exhibiting extreme activity are termed as super active regions (SARs). Recently, solar AR 13664 produced 23 X-class flares and unleashed multiple coronal mass ejections, which triggered a severe geomagnetic storm during 2024 May 10–11—the strongest storm on record since 2003. Here, we put AR 13664 in historical context over the cumulative period of 1874 May–2024 June. We find that AR 13664 stands at the 99.95th percentile in the distribution of area over 1874 May–2024 June and at the 99.10th percentile in terms of flux content among all ARs over the period 1996 April–2024 June. Our analysis indicates that five of its magnetic properties rank at the 100.00th percentile among all ARs observed during 2010 May–2024 June by the Solar Dynamic Observatory. A total of 16 magnetic properties of AR 13664 are ranked higher than the 99.00th percentile when compared to other ARs recorded in Space-weather Helioseismic Magnetic Imager Active Region Patch data series, which includes all well-established flare relevant parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AR 13664 reached its most dynamic flare productive state following a rapid rate of rise of its flare-relevant parameters and that the X-class flares were more frequent near their peak values. Our analyses establish AR 13644 to be an SAR and provide a paradigm for investigating their flare-relevant physical characteristics.

<title>Red Stellar Populations and Dust Extinction toward W3</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We explore red stellar populations toward the W3 giant molecular cloud through the use of optical-to-infrared (IR) photometry and Gaia DR 3 data, simultaneously characterizing stellar content and properties of dust in the molecular medium. We use a Rayleigh–Jeans color excess method modified to de-redden stellar observations of both red giants (RGs) and OB stars, and construct an IR Hertzsprung–Russell diagram validated against the Besançon Galactic model. Taking advantage of the near-universal IR interstellar extinction law and precise Gaia measurements, we develop a method for obtaining the spectral classification, foreground extinction, and distance moduli of stars, validated by spectroscopically confirmed OB stars. We constrain the observed parallax and proper motion of OB stars in W3, demonstrating the importance of considering systematic effects in the parallax bias, and assign parallax- and proper-motion-based cloud membership to our stellar samples. While it has been assumed that all spectroscopic OB stars are inside the W3 cloud, we find evidence of seven background B stars and three potential runaway OB stars. The methods developed here, which are based on known stellar populations, enable us to identify 82 new OB candidates that are confidently within the cloud. We quantify several dust-to-dust empirical correlations, in particular the IR color excess E(H − [4.5]) and the optical depth τ1 of submillimeter dust emission at 1 THz using RGs behind W3, measuring a best fit of .

<title>Disk-locking Regulates Stellar Rotation in Young Clusters: Insights from NGC 2264</title>

Many young clusters possess extended main sequences, a phenomenon commonly ascribed to stellar rotation. However, the mechanism behind their very wide stellar rotation distributions remains unclear. A proposed explanation is that magnetic star–disk interaction can regulate stellar rotation, i.e., protostars with longer disk lifetimes will eventually evolve into slow rotators, and vice versa. To examine this hypothesis, we took the star-forming region NGC 2264, as a test bed. We have studied its high-mass pre-main-sequence and zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) stars. We find that, on average, diskless pre-main-sequence stars rotate faster than their disk-bearing counterparts. The stellar rotation distribution of the ZAMS stars is similar to evolved young clusters. We conclude that disk-locking may play a crucial role in the rotational velocity distribution of intermediate-mass early-type stars. We suggest that the observed wide stellar rotation distributions in many young clusters can occur in their early stages.

The spectral analysis of molecule-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars is challenging. Although other calcium and fluorine bearing molecules are observed in the microwave and in the visible spectrum of AGB stars, CaF has never been detected, despite favorable chemical equilibrium predictions. Yet, measuring the CaF abundance could give more insight into the fluorine budget of AGB stars and allow better simulation of stellar spectra. In this work, we present an analysis of the visible spectrum of CaF obtained with a Fourier transform spectrometer. CaF A2Π−X2Σ+ and B2Σ+−X2Σ+ band systems were excited with a hollow cathode discharge. Using previous fluorescence spectroscopy measurements, highly accurate ground state constants, and reasonable extrapolation schemes, the strongest features of CaF in the visible spectrum can be accurately modeled for both band systems. Spectroscopic constants are determined for A2 Π with v ≤ 16 and for B2Σ+ with v ≤ 20. Ab initio transition dipole moment curves of both transitions were calculated and scaled, and we provide a line list with Einstein A coefficients and oscillator strengths. This line list can be used to simulate spectra of CaF at temperatures and pressures relevant to astrophysical environments.

<title>The Theory of Resonant Cosmic Ray–driven Instabilities—Growth and Saturation of Single Modes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Cosmic-ray (CR) feedback is critical for galaxy formation as CRs drive galactic winds, regularize star formation in galaxies, and escape from active galactic nuclei to heat the cooling cores of galaxy clusters. The feedback strength of CRs depends on their coupling to the background plasma and, as such, on the effective CR transport speed. Traditionally, this has been hypothesized to depend on the balance between the wave growth of CR-driven instabilities and their damping. Here, we study the physics of CR-driven instabilities from first principles, starting from a gyrotropic distribution of CR ions that stream along a background magnetic field. We develop a theory of the underlying processes that organize the particles’ orbits and in particular their gyrophases, which provides an intuitive physical picture of (i) wave growth as the CR gyrophases start to bunch up lopsidedly toward the local wave magnetic field, (ii) instability saturation as a result of CRs overtaking the wave and damping its amplitude without isotropizing CRs in the wave frame, and (iii) CR backreaction onto the unstable plasma waves as the CR gyrophases follow a pendulum motion around the wave magnetic field. Using our new fluid-particle-in-cell code fluid-SHARP, we validate our theory on the evolution and excitation of individual unstable modes, such as forward- and backward-propagating Alfvén and whistler waves. We show that these kinetic simulations support our theoretical considerations, thus potentially foreshadowing a revision of the theory of CR transport in galaxies and galaxy clusters.

The pseudo two-color diagram, known as chromosome map (ChM), is a valuable tool for identifying globular clusters (GCs), which consist of single or multiple stellar populations (MPs). Recent surveys of Galactic GCs using ChMs have provided stringent observational constraints on the formation of GCs and their stellar populations. However, these surveys have primarily focused on GCs at moderate distances from the Galactic center and composed of MPs. In this paper, we present the first detailed study of the stellar composition of four GCs in the outer halo of the Milky Way: Arp 2, Ruprecht 106, Terzan 7, and Terzan 8. Our analysis is based on high-precision photometry obtained from images collected with the Hubble Space Telescope in the F275W, F336W, F438W, F606W, and F814W bands. We find that Ruprecht 106 and Terzan 7 are composed solely of a single stellar population, whereas Arp 2 and Terzan 8 host both first- and second-population stars. In these clusters, the second population comprises about half and one-third of the total number of GC stars, respectively. The results from this paper and the literature suggest that the threshold in the initial GC mass, if present, should be smaller than approximately 105M⊙. The first-population stars of Arp 2 and Terzan 8, along with the stars of the simple-population GCs Ruprecht 106 and Terzan 7, exhibit intrinsic F275W – F814W color spreads, likely indicative of [Fe/H] variations of approximately 0.05–0.30 dex. This suggests that star-to-star metallicity variations are a common feature of star clusters, regardless of the presence of MPs.

<title>Photospheric Swirls in a Quiet-Sun Region</title>

Swirl-shaped flow structures have been observed throughout the solar atmosphere, in both emission and absorption, at different altitudes and locations, and are believed to be associated with magnetic structures. However, the distribution patterns of such swirls, especially their spatial positions, remain unclear. Using the Automated Swirl Detection Algorithm, we identified swirls from the high-resolution photospheric observations, centered on Fe i 630.25 nm, of a quiet region near the Sun's central meridian by the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. Via a detailed study of the locations of the detected small-scale swirls with an average radius of ~300 km, we found that most of them are located in lanes between mesogranules (which have an average diameter of ~5.4 Mm) instead of the commonly believed intergranular lanes. The squared rotation, expansion/contraction and vector speeds, and proxy kinetic energy are all found to follow Gaussian distributions. Their rotation speed, expansion/contraction speed, and circulation are positively correlated with their radius. All these results suggest that photospheric swirls at different scales and locations across the observational 56 5 × 57 5 field of view could share the same triggering mechanism at preferred spatial and energy scales. A comparison with our previous work suggests that the number of photospheric swirls is positively correlated with the number of local magnetic concentrations, stressing again the close relation between swirls and local magnetic concentrations: the number of swirls should positively correlate with the number and strength of local magnetic concentrations.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Considering radio-interferometric observations, we present a fast and efficient estimator to compute the binned angular bispectrum (ABS) from gridded visibility data. The estimator makes use of Fast Fourier Transform techniques to compute the ABS covering all possible triangle shapes and sizes. Here, we present the formalism of the estimator and validate it using simulated visibility data for the Murchison Widefield Array observations at ν = 154.25 MHz. We find that our estimator is able to faithfully recover the ABS of the simulated sky signal with ≈10%–15% accuracy for a wide variety of triangle shapes and sizes across the range of angular multipoles 46 ≤ ℓ ≤ 1320. In future work, we plan to apply this to actual data and also generalize it to estimate the three-dimensional redshifted 21 cm bispectrum.

<title>Predictions of Dust Continuum Emission from a Potential Circumplanetary Disk: A Case Study of the Planet Candidate AB Aurigae b</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Gas-accreting planets embedded in protoplanetary disks are expected to show dust thermal emission from their circumplanetary disks (CPDs). However, a recently reported gas-accreting planet candidate, AB Aurigae b, has not been detected in (sub)millimeter continuum observations. We calculate the evolution of dust in the potential CPD of AB Aurigae b and predict its thermal emission at 1.3 mm wavelength as a case study, where the obtained features may also be applied to other gas-accreting planets. We find that the expected flux density from the CPD is lower than the 3σ level of the previous continuum observation by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array with broad ranges of parameters, consistent with a nondetection. However, the expected planet mass and gas accretion rate are higher if the reduction of the observed near-infrared continuum and Hα line emission due to the extinction by small grains is considered, resulting in higher flux density of the dust emission from the CPD at (sub)millimeter wavelengths. We find that the corrected predictions of the dust emission are stronger than the 3σ level of the previous observation with the typical dust-to-gas mass ratio of the inflow to the CPD. This result suggests that the dust supply to the vicinity of AB Aurigae b is small if the planet candidate is not the scattered light of the star but is a planet and has a CPD. Future continuum observations at shorter wavelengths are required to obtain more robust clues to the question of whether the candidate is a planet or not.

Recent multiwavelength observations have highlighted magnetars as significant sources of cosmic rays, particularly through their gamma-ray emissions. This study examines three magnetar regions—CXOU J171405.7–31031, Swift J1834−0846, and SGR 1806−20—known for emitting detectable electromagnetic signals. We assess the detectability of these regions using the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) by conducting an ON/OFF spectral analysis and compare the expected results with existing observations. Our findings indicate that CTAO will detect gamma-ray emissions from these three magnetar regions with significantly reduced emission flux errors compared to current instruments. In particular, the study shows that the CXOUJ1714−3810 and SwiftJ1834−0846 magnetar regions can be observed by the full southern and northern CTAO arrays in just 5 hr of observation, with mean significances above 10σ and 30σ, respectively. This paper discusses the regions analyzed, presents key results, and concludes with insights drawn from the study.

<title>Type IV-like Solar Radio Burst Consisting of a Series of Short-time Bursts Observed by PSP</title>

Solar and interplanetary radio bursts can reflect the existence and motion of energetic electrons and are therefore a kind of vital phenomenon in solar activities. The present study reported a solar radio storm observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) in its eighth orbital encounter phase, and it lasted about 20 hr in a frequency range of 0.5–15 MHz, called the type IV-like burst. It consists of a series of numerous short-time (ST) bursts with the central frequency drifting slowly from ~5 to ~1 MHz, and each individual ST burst appears at a much faster frequency drifting rate and has a typical frequency range of a few MHz and a short duration of about 1–4 minutes. Based on the empirical models of the solar atmosphere adopted commonly, combining the in situ measurement by PSP, we analyzed and compared some possible mechanisms for the generation of these small-scale ST bursts and proposed that they were generated probably by a group of solitary kinetic Alfvén waves (SKAWs) in a magnetic loop accompanying coronal mass ejection and slowly moving outward, in which the frequency drifting of individual ST burst is caused by the SKAW's propagation and the central frequency drifting may be attributed to the motion of the magnetic loop.

<title>Epsilon Canis Majoris: The Brightest Extreme-ultraviolet Source with Surprisingly Low Interstellar Absorption</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b8b</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The B2 star Epsilon Canis Majoris (ϵ CMa), at parallax distance d = 124 ± 2 pc, dominates the H i photoionization of the Local Interstellar Cloud. At its closer parallax distance compared to previous estimates, ϵ CMa has a 0.9 mag fainter absolute magnitude MV = −3.97 ± 0.04. We combine measurements of distance with the integrated flux f = (41.5 ± 3.3) × 10−6 erg cm−2 s−1 and angular diameter θd = 0.80 ± 0.05 mas to produce a consistent set of stellar parameters: radius R = 10.7 ± 0.7 R⊙, mass M = 13.1 ± 2.3 M⊙, gravity , effective temperature Teff ≈ 21,000 K, and luminosity L ≈ 20,000 L⊙. These parameters place ϵ CMa outside the β Cephei instability strip, consistent with its observed lack of pulsations. The observed extreme-ultraviolet spectrum yields a hydrogen photoionization rate ΓHI ≈ 10−15 s−1 (at Earth). The total flux decrement factor at the Lyman limit (ΔLL = 5000 ± 500) is a combination of attenuation in the stellar atmosphere (Δstar = 110 ± 10) and interstellar medium (ΔISM = 45 ± 5) with optical depth τLL = 3.8 ± 0.1. After correcting for interstellar H i column density NHI = (6 ± 1) × 1017cm−2, we find a stellar LyC photon flux ΦLyC ≈ 3000 cm−2 s−1 and ionizing luminosity QLyC = 1045.7±0.3 photons s−1. The photoionization rate ΓH ≈ (1–2) × 10−14 s−1 at the cloud surface produces an ionization fraction (30%–40%) for total hydrogen density nH = 0.2 cm−3. With its 27.3 ± 0.4 km s−1 heliocentric radial velocity and small proper motion, ϵ CMa passed within 9.3 ± 0.5 pc of the Sun 4.4 Myr ago, with a 180 times higher photoionization rate.

<title>Transients by Black Hole Formation from Red Supergiants: Impact of Dense Circumstellar Matter</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Failed supernovae (SNe), which are likely the main channel for forming stellar-mass black holes, are predicted to accompany mass ejections much weaker than typical core-collapse SNe. We conduct a grid of one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamical simulations to explore the emission of failed SNe from red supergiant progenitors, leveraging recent understanding of the weak explosion and the dense circumstellar matter (CSM) surrounding these stars. We find from these simulations and semianalytical modeling that diffusion in the CSM prolongs the early emission powered by shock breakout/cooling. The early emission has peak luminosities of ~107–108 L⊙ in optical and UV and durations of days to weeks. The presence of dense CSM aids in the detection of the early bright peak from these events via near-future wide-field surveys such as Rubin Observatory, ULTRASAT, and UVEX.

<title>Implication of Galaxy-scale Negative Feedback by One of the Most Powerful Multiphase Outflows in a Hyperluminous Infrared Galaxy at Intermediate Redshift</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad93ab</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Powerful galactic outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are commonly considered as one of the main mechanisms to regulate star formation in massive galaxies. Ultra- and hyperluminous IR galaxies (U/HyLIRGs) are thought to represent a transition phase of galaxies from a rapidly growing period to a quiescent status as gas is swept out by outflows, providing a laboratory in which to investigate outflows and their feedback effects on hosts. In this paper we report recent Gemini and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of a HyLIRG, J1126, at z = 0.46842, which has been identified with a puzzling coexistence of a fast ionized outflow (>2000 km s−1) and an intense starburst (star formation rate of 800 M⊙ yr−1). The Gemini observation shows the fast ionized outflow is extended to several kiloparsecs with a mass-loss rate of 180 M⊙ yr−1. A massive molecular outflow with a high mass-loss rate (2500 M⊙ yr−1) is revealed by ALMA. The multiphase outflows show large factors of momentum boost and loading of kinetic power, indicating a driving by the thermal pressure of a nuclear hot wind and/or the radiation pressure of a highly obscured AGN. In addition to ejection of kinetic energy, it is also found that the powerful outflow can induce an ionizing shock in the galaxy disk and enhance the excitation and dissociation of molecular gas. The powerful outflow probably results in an instantaneous negative feedback and shows potential to regulate host growth in the long term.

<title>Nebular and Nonthermal Radio Emissions for Young Stellar Populations with PARSEC v1.2s</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9901</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this paper, we compute, by means of the recently and thoroughly updated PARSE v1.2 s database of stellar nonrotating evolutionary tracks, the integrated stellar spectra, the ionizing photon budget, and the supernovae rates of young simple stellar populations (SSPs), for five metallicities between 0.0001 and 0.02 and four choices of stellar initial mass function (IMF) upper mass limits between 40 M⊙ and 350 M⊙. Using the photo-ionization code CLOUDY, we compute, at this same range of metallicities and limits, the intensities of some selected recombination and collisionally excited lines as a function of the age of the SSP. We account for the electron temperature dependence on IMF upper mass limit and metallicity while computing the thermal radio emission component, and also accounted for recent advances in core-collapse supernova explosion models while computing the nonthermal radio emission component. We self-consistently add the emission lines, nebular continuum, and nonthermal radio emission to the original SSP integrated photospheric spectra. Finally, from the resulting new suite of SSPs, we provide a consistent set of analytical relations between star formation rate (SFR) and ultraviolet, optical, and thermal radio luminosities that can be used to convert attenuation-corrected and dust-unaffected luminosities to SFR estimates. In a forthcoming paper, we will use our new SSP libraries as input to the state-of-the-art radiative transfer model GRAphites and SILicates to test the overall performance of these SSPs in reproducing the observed spectral energy distribution of young star-forming galaxies.

<title>Ionized Gas Outflows in the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) Survey: Signatures of AGN Feedback in Low-mass Galaxies</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9a57</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9a57</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a sample of 398 galaxies with ionized gas outflow signatures in their spectra from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly Survey Data Release 4, including 45 low-mass galaxies with stellar masses M* < 1010M⊙. We assemble our sample by systematically searching for the presence of a second velocity component in the [O iii]λλ4959, 5007 doublet emission line in 39,612 galaxies with redshifts z < 0.3. The host galaxies are classified using the Baldwin–Phillips–Terlevich diagram, with ~89% identified as active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and composites and 11% as star-forming (SF) galaxies. The outflows are typically faster in AGNs with a median velocity of 936 km s−1 compared to 655 km s−1 in the SF objects. Of particular interest are the 45 galaxies in the low-mass range, of which a third are classified as AGNs/composites. The outflows from the low-mass AGNs are also faster and more blueshifted compared to those in the low-mass SF galaxies. This indicates that black hole outflows can affect host galaxies in the low-mass range and that AGN feedback in galaxies with M* < 1010M⊙ should be considered in galaxy evolution models.

<title>PS1-11aop: Probing the Mass-loss History of a Luminous Interacting Supernova Prior to Its Final Eruption with Multiwavelength Observations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9336</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9336</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Luminous interacting supernovae (SNe) are a class of stellar explosions whose progenitors underwent vigorous mass loss in the years prior to core collapse. While the mechanism by which this material is ejected is still debated, obtaining the full density profile of the circumstellar medium (CSM) could reveal more about this process. Here, we present an extensive multiwavelength study of PS1-11aop, a luminous and slowly declining Type IIn SNe discovered by the Pan-STARRS Medium Deep Survey. PS1-11aop had a peak r-band magnitude of −20.5 mag, a total radiated energy >8 × 1050 erg, and it exploded near the center of a star-forming galaxy with super-solar metallicity. We obtained multiple detections at the location of PS1-11aop in the radio and X-ray bands between 4 and 10 yr post-explosion, and if due to the supernova (SN), it is one of the most luminous radio SNe identified to date. Taken together, the multiwavelength properties of PS1-11aop are consistent with a CSM density profile with multiple zones. The early optical emission is consistent with the SN blastwave interacting with a dense and confined CSM shell, which contains multiple solar masses of material that was likely ejected in the final <10–100 yr prior to the explosion, (∼0.05−1.0 M⊙ yr−1 at radii of ≲1016 cm). The radio observations, on the other hand, are consistent with a sparser environment (≲2 × 10−3M⊙ yr−1 at radii of ∼0.5–1 × 1017 cm)—thus probing the history of the progenitor star prior to its final mass-loss episode.

<title>SN H0pe: The First Measurement of H 0 from a Multiply Imaged Type Ia Supernova, Discovered by JWST</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The first James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near InfraRed Camera imaging in the field of the galaxy cluster PLCK G165.7+67.0 (z = 0.35) uncovered a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) at z = 1.78, called “SN H0pe.” Three different images of this one SN were detected as a result of strong gravitational lensing, each one traversing a different path in spacetime, thereby inducing a relative delay in the arrival of each image. Follow-up JWST observations of all three SN images enabled photometric and rare spectroscopic measurements of the two relative time delays. Following strict blinding protocols which oversaw a live unblinding and regulated postunblinding changes, these two measured time delays were compared to the predictions of seven independently constructed cluster lens models to measure a value for the Hubble constant, H0 = 71.8 + 9.2 − 8.1 km s−1 Mpc−1. The range of admissible H0 values predicted across the lens models limits further precision, reflecting the well-known degeneracies between lens model constraints and time delays. It has long been theorized that a way forward is to leverage a standard candle, but this has not been realized until now. For the first time, the lens models are evaluated by their agreement with the SN absolute magnifications, breaking degeneracies and producing our best estimate, H0 = km s−1 Mpc−1. This is the first precise measurement of H0 from a multiply imaged SN Ia and only the second from any multiply imaged SN.

<title>The S4G-WISE View of Global Star Formation in the Nearby Universe</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this work, we present source-tailored Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mid-infrared photometry (at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 23 μm) of 2812 galaxies in the extended Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies sample, and characterize the mid-infrared colors and dust properties of this legacy nearby galaxy data set. Informed by the relative emission between W3 (12 μm) and W4 (23 μm), we rederive star formation rate (SFR) scaling relations calibrated to LTIR, which results in improved agreement between the two tracers. By inverse–variance weighting the W3 and W4-derived SFRs, we generate a combined mid-infrared SFR that is a broadly robust measure of star formation activity in dusty, star-forming galaxies in the nearby Universe. In addition, we investigate the use of a W3-derived dust density metric, Σ12 μm (L⊙/kpc2), to estimate the SFR deficit of low mass, low dust galaxies. This is achieved by combining WISE with existing Galaxy Evolution Explorer ultraviolet (UV) photometry, which we further use to explore the relationship between dust and UV emission as a function of morphology. Finally, we use our derived SFR prescriptions to examine the location of galaxies in the log SFR–log Mstellar plane, as a function of morphological type, which underscores the complexity of dust-derived properties seen in galaxies of progressively earlier type.

<title>ALMA Survey of Orion Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (ALMASOP): Nested Morphological and Kinematic Structures of Outflows Revealed in SiO and CO Emission</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Survey of Orion Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (ALMASOP) reveals complex nested morphological and kinematic features of molecular outflows through the CO (J = 2−1) and SiO (J = 5−4) emission. We characterize the jet and outflow kinematics of the ALMASOP sample in four representative sources (HOPS 10, 315, 358, and G203.21-11.20W2) through channel maps and position–velocity diagrams (PVDs) parallel and transverse to the outflow axes. The combined CO and SiO emission exhibits the coexistence of the conventional extremely high-velocity jets and shell-like low-velocity cavity walls and new features. More complex, nested bubble-like and filamentary structures in the images and channel maps, triangle-shaped regions near the base of the parallel PVDs, and regions composed of rhombus/oval shapes in the transverse PVDs are also evident. Such features find natural explanations within the bubble structure of the unified model of jet, wind, and ambient medium. The reverse shock cavity is revealed on the PVD base regions, and other features naturally arise within the dynamic postshock region of magnetic interaction. The finer nested shells observed within the compressed wind region reveal previously unnoticed shocked emission between the jet and the conventional large cavity walls. These pseudopulse-produced filamentary features connect to the jetlike knotty blobs, creating an impression of episodicity in mass ejection. SiO emission is enhanced downstream of the reverse shock boundary, with jetlike excitation conditions. Combined, these observed features reveal the extended structures induced by the magnetic interplay between a jet-bearing magnetized wide-angle wind and its ambient magnetized surrounding medium.

<title>Blowing Out the Candle: How to Quench Galaxies at High Redshift—An Ensemble of Rapid Starbursts, AGN Feedback, and Environment</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9472</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent observations with JWST and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array have revealed extremely massive quiescent galaxies at redshifts of z = 3 and higher, indicating both rapid onset and quenching of star formation. Using the cosmological simulation suite Magneticum Pathfinder, we reproduce the observed number densities and stellar masses, with 36 quenched galaxies of stellar mass larger than 3 × 1010M⊙ at z = 3.42. We find that these galaxies are quenched through a rapid burst of star formation and subsequent active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback caused by a particularly isotropic collapse of surrounding gas, occurring on timescales of around 200 Myr or shorter. The resulting quenched galaxies host stellar components that are kinematically fast rotating and alpha-enhanced, while exhibiting a steeper metallicity and flatter age gradient compared to galaxies of similar stellar mass. The gas of the galaxies has been metal enriched and ejected. We find that quenched galaxies do not inhabit the densest nodes, but rather sit in local underdensities. We analyze observable metrics to predict future quenching at high redshifts, finding that on shorter timescales <500 Myr, the ratio Mbh/M* is the best predictor, followed by the burstiness of the preceding star formation, t50–t90 (time to go from 50% to 90% stellar mass). On longer timescales, >1 Gyr, the environment becomes the strongest predictor, followed by t50–t90, indicating that at high redshifts the consumption of old gas and lack of new gas are more relevant for long-term prevention of star formation than the presence of a massive AGN. We predict that relics of such high-z quenched galaxies should best be characterized by a strong alpha enhancement.

<title>The Optical Extinction Law Depends on Magnetic Field Orientation: The RV –ψ Relation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
For aspherical interstellar dust grains aligned with their short axes preferentially parallel to the local magnetic field, the amount of extinction per grain is larger when the magnetic field is along the line of sight and smaller when in the plane of the sky. To the extent that optical extinction arises from both aligned and unaligned grain populations with different extinction properties, changes in the magnetic field orientation induce changes in its wavelength dependence, parameterized by RV ≡ AV/E(B − V). We demonstrate that the measured total and polarized extinction curves of the diffuse Galactic interstellar medium imply RV varies from 3.21 when the magnetic field is along the line of sight (ψ = 0) to RV = 3.05 when in the plane of the sky (ψ = 90°). This effect could therefore account for much of the large-scale RV variation observed across the sky (σ(RV) ≃ 0.2), particularly at high Galactic latitudes.

<title>Constraining the Gamma-Ray Burst Jet Opening Angle Based on the Very Steep Decay Phase</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Thanks to the rapid follow-up observations by the Swift X-Ray Telescope (XRT), a good part of gamma-ray bursts' (GRBs) high-latitude emission have been observed in the X-ray band. Some even show a dropdown decay after this period, which strongly indicates the edge of the jet is corresponding to the breaking time. This study constrains the jet opening angles of GRBs by analyzing the very steep decay phase in the early X-ray afterglow. Using data from Swift/XRT, we identified GRBs with significant breaks in their light curves and applied a broken power-law model to describe the decay phases. Assuming a spherical and isotropic emitting surface, we set constraints on the radiation radius (Rγ) to estimate jet opening angles (θjet) from the breaking time. Our results indicate that jet opening angles can be constrained, although they are sensitive to the assumed radiation radius. This approach provides yet another method for estimating GRB jet opening angles.

<title>Quadrupole Moment of a Magnetically Confined Mountain on an Accreting Neutron Star in General Relativity</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
General relativistic corrections are calculated for the quadrupole moment of a magnetically confined mountain on an accreting neutron star. The hydromagnetic structure of the mountain satisfies the general relativistic Grad–Shafranov equation supplemented by the flux-freezing condition of ideal magnetohydrodynamics, as in previous calculations of the magnetic dipole moment. It is found that the ellipticity, and hence the gravitational wave strain, are up to 12% greater than in the analogous Newtonian system. The direct contribution of the magnetic field to the nonaxisymmetric component of the stress-energy tensor is shown to be negligible in accreting systems such as low-mass X-ray binaries.

<title>Closing the Stellar Labels Gap: Stellar Label independent Evidence for [α/M] Information in Gaia BP/RP Spectra</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Data-driven models for stellar spectra that depend on stellar labels suffer from label systematics which decrease model performance: the stellar labels gap. To close the stellar labels gap, we present a stellar label independent model for Gaia BP/RP spectra. We develop a novel implementation of a variational auto-encoder, which learns to generate an XP spectrum and accompanying scatter without relying on stellar labels. We demonstrate that our model achieves competitive XP spectra reconstructions in comparison to stellar label dependent models. We find that our model learns stellar properties directly from the data itself. We then apply our model to XP/APOGEE giant stars to study the [α/M] information in Gaia XP. We provide strong evidence that the XP spectra contain meaningful [α/M] information by demonstrating that our model learns the α-bimodality, without relying on stellar label correlations for stars with Teff < 5000 K, while also being sensitive to the anomalous abundances of Gaia-Enceladus stars. We have publicly released our trained model, codebase and data. Importantly, our stellar label independent model can be implemented for any and all XP spectra because our model's performance scales with training object density, not training label density.

<title>Testing the Cosmic Distance Duality Relation Using Strong Gravitational Lensing Time Delays and Type Ia Supernovae</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a comprehensive test of the cosmic distance duality relation (DDR) using a combination of strong gravitational lensing (SGL) time delay measurements and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) data. We investigate three different parameterizations of potential DDR violations. To bridge the gap between SGL and SNe Ia data sets, we implement an artificial neural network approach to reconstruct the distance modulus of SNe Ia. Our analysis uniquely considers both scenarios where the absolute magnitude of SNe Ia (MB) is treated as a free parameter and where it is fixed to a Cepheid-calibrated value. Using a sample of six SGL systems and the Pantheon+ SNe Ia data set, we find no statistically significant evidence for DDR violations across all parameterizations. The consistency of our findings across different parameterizations not only reinforces confidence in the standard DDR but also demonstrates the robustness of our analytical approach.

<title>Gravitational-wave Dark Siren Cosmology Systematics from Galaxy Weighting</title>

The detection of GW170817 and the measurement of its redshift from the associated electromagnetic counterpart provided the first gravitational-wave (GW) determination of the Hubble constant (H0), demonstrating the potential power of standard siren cosmology. In contrast to this “bright siren” approach, the “dark siren” approach can be utilized for GW sources in the absence of an electromagnetic counterpart: One considers all galaxies contained within the localization volume as potential hosts. When statistically averaging over the potential host galaxies, weighting them by physically motivated properties (e.g., tracing star formation or stellar mass) could improve convergence. Using mock galaxy catalogs, we explore the impact of these weightings on the measurement of H0. We find that incorrect weighting schemes can lead to significant biases due to two effects: the assumption of an incorrect galaxy redshift distribution, and preferentially weighting incorrect host galaxies during the inference. The magnitudes of these biases are influenced by the number of galaxies along each line of sight, the measurement uncertainty in the GW luminosity distance, and correlations in the parameter space of galaxies. We show that the bias may be overcome from improved localization constraints in future GW detectors, a strategic choice of priors or weighting prescription, and by restricting the analysis to a subset of high-signal-to-noise ratio events. We propose the use of hierarchical inference as a diagnostic of incorrectly weighted prescriptions. Such approaches can simultaneously infer the correct weighting scheme and the values of the cosmological parameters, thereby mitigating the bias in dark siren cosmology due to incorrect host-galaxy weighting.

<title>A Cosmic Ray Acceleration Mechanism Based on Background Flow Velocity Inhomogeneities Yielding Power-law Spectra</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In astrophysics, one significant challenge lies in understanding the acceleration of cosmic rays, which leads to the occurrence of a power law. In this article, momentum transport generated by the combined effects of pitch-angle diffusion and background flow velocity inhomogeneities is proposed to obtain a cosmic rays acceleration mechanism, starting from the well-known focused transport equation describing particle diffusion and acceleration. The inhomogeneities of background flow velocity are ubiquitous in the astrophysical environment. The equation for the isotropic part of the distribution function of charged energetic particles is derived, and its solution is obtained, demonstrating the form of momentum power laws of cosmic rays. In addition, if it is assumed that cosmic rays penetrate compressive MHD waves or turbulence, for quasi-steady states, the spectral index δ of the momentum power law spectrum of cosmic rays is found to be in the range [−5, −3], which includes the observed power law indices of galactic cosmic rays. The results obtained in this article demonstrate that the mechanism proposed in this article, along with shock acceleration, may also contribute to the acceleration of galactic cosmic rays. Furthermore, when momentum convection effect and higher-order momentum derivative terms are considered, the indices of power laws should be smaller than −5. This may explain the power laws of solar energetic particle events.

<title>The Effect of Galaxy Interactions on Starbursts in Milky Way-mass Galaxies in FIRE Simulations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Simulations and observations suggest that galaxy interactions may enhance the star formation rate (SFR) in merging galaxies. One proposed mechanism is the torque exerted on the gas and stars in the larger galaxy by the smaller galaxy. We analyze the interaction torques and star formation activity on six galaxies from the FIRE-2 simulation suite with masses comparable to the Milky Way galaxy at redshift z = 0. We trace the halos from z = 3.6 to z = 0, calculating the torque exerted by the nearby galaxies on the gas in the central galaxy. We calculate the correlation between the torque and the SFR across the simulations for various mass ratios. For near-equal-stellar-mass-ratio interactions in the galaxy sample, occurring between z = 1.2−3.6, there is a positive and statistically significant correlation between the torque from nearby galaxies on the gas of the central galaxies and the SFR. For all other samples, no statistically significant correlation is found between the torque and the SFR. Our analysis shows that some, but not all, major interactions cause starbursts in the simulated Milky Way-mass galaxies, and that most starbursts are not caused by galaxy interactions. The transition from “bursty” at high redshift (z ≳ 1) to “steady” star formation state at later times is independent of the interaction history of the galaxies, and most of the interactions do not leave significant imprints on the overall trend of the star formation history of the galaxies.

<title>On the Existence of Long-period Decayless Oscillations in Short Active Region Loops</title>

Decayless kink oscillations, characterized by their lack of decay in amplitude, have been detected in coronal loops of varying scales in active regions, the quiet Sun, and coronal holes. Short-period (<50 s) decayless oscillations have been detected in short loops (< 50 Mm) within active regions. Nevertheless, long-period decayless oscillations in these loops remain relatively unexplored and crucial for understanding the wave modes and excitation mechanisms of decayless oscillations. We present the statistical analysis of decayless oscillations from two active regions observed by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager onboard Solar Orbiter. The average loop length and period of the detected oscillations are 19 Mm and 151 s, respectively. We find 82 long-period and 23 short-period oscillations in these loops. We do not obtain a significant correlation between loop length and period. We discuss the possibility of different wave modes in short loops, although standing waves cannot be excluded from possible wave modes. Furthermore, a different branch exists for active region short loops in the loop length versus period relation, similar to decayless waves in short loops in the quiet Sun and coronal holes. The magnetic fields derived from MHD seismology, based on standing kink modes, show lower values for multiple oscillations compared to previous estimates for long loops in active regions. Additionally, the comparison of period distributions in short loops across different coronal regions indicates that different excitation mechanisms may trigger short-period kink oscillations in active regions compared to the quiet Sun and coronal holes.

<title>A uGMRT and MeerKAT Study of Radio Relics in the Low-mass Merging Cluster PSZ2 G200.95−28.16</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Diffuse radio sources known as radio relics are direct tracers of shocks in the outskirts of merging galaxy clusters. PSZ2 G200.95–28.16, a low-mass merging cluster (M500 = (2.7 ± 0.2) × 1014M⊙), features a prominent radio relic, first identified by R. Kale et al. We name this relic as the Seahorse. The MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey has confirmed two additional radio relics, R2 and R3, in this cluster. We present new observations of this cluster with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at 400 and 650 MHz, paired with Chandra X-ray data. The largest linear sizes for the three relics are 1.53 Mpc, 1.12 kpc, and 340 kpc. All three radio relics are polarized at 1283 MHz. Assuming the diffusive shock acceleration model, the spectral indices of the relics imply shock Mach Numbers of 3.1 ± 0.8 and 2.8 ± 0.9 for the Seahorse and R2, respectively. The Chandra X-ray surface brightness map shows two prominent subclusters, but the relics are not perpendicular to the likely merger axis, as typically observed; no shocks are detected at the locations of the relics. We discuss possible merger scenarios in light of the low mass of the cluster and the radio and X-ray properties of the relics. The relic R2 follows the correlation known in the radio relic power and cluster-mass plane, but the Seahorse and R3 relics are outliers. We have also discovered a radio ring in our 650 MHz uGMRT image that could be an Odd Radio Circle candidate.

<title>Probing Cosmic Isotropy with the FAST All Sky H i Survey</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9922</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This paper leverages the first released catalog from the FAST All Sky H i Survey (FASHI) to examine the hypothesis of cosmic isotropy in the local Universe. Given the design of the overall FAST survey, the inhomogeneous detection sensitivity of FASHI is likely to introduce significant biases in the statistical properties of the catalog. To mitigate the potential influence of spurious clustering effects due to these sensitivity variations, we focus on extragalactic H i sources within the sensitivity range of [0.65, 1.0]. This refined subsample is divided into 10 distinct sky regions, for which we compute the two-point angular correlation functions (2PACF) over angular scales of 0 5 < θ < 10°. We apply the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to fit these 2PACFs with a power-law model and assess the statistical significance of the best-fit parameters for the 10 FASHI sky regions by comparing them against results from mock catalogs generated under the assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy. Our findings indicate that the local Universe, as traced by the H i sources in the FASHI survey, aligns with the cosmic isotropy hypothesis within a 2σ confidence level. We do not detect any statistically significant deviations from cosmic isotropy in the FASHI survey data.

<title>PKS 2332–017 and PMN J1916–1519: Candidate Blazar Counterparts to Two High-energy Neutrino Events</title>

We report our counterpart identification study for two high-energy neutrino events IC-130127A and IC-131204A listed in the IceCube Event Catalog of Alert Tracks. These two events belong to Gold alerts, which have a significant probability of being of astrophysical origin. Within the events’ 90% positional uncertainty regions, we, respectively, find PKS 2332–017 and PMN J1916–1519. The first source is a flat-spectrum radio quasar at redshift z = 1.18, and the second is a blazar of an uncertain type with photometric z = 0.968. As they correspondingly had a γ-ray flare temporally coincident with the arrival times of IC-130127A and IC-131204A, we identify them as the respective neutrino emitters. Detailed analysis of the γ-ray data for the two blazars, obtained with the Large Area Telescope onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, is conducted. The two flares, respectively, from PKS 2332–017 and PMN J1916–1519 lasted ~4 yr and ~4 months and showed possible emission hardening by containing high-energy ~2–10 GeV photons in the emissions. Accompanying the flare of PKS 2332–017, optical and mid-infrared brightening variations were also observed. We discuss the properties of the two sources and compare the properties with those of the previously reported (candidate) neutrino-emitting blazars.

<title>Determining the Nature of IC 10 X-2: A Comprehensive Study of the Optical/IR Emission from an Extragalactic BeHMXB</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad82df</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a comprehensive analysis of the optical and infrared (IR) properties of high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) IC 10 X-2, classified as a supergiant HMXB and superfast X-ray transient by previous work. Our analysis of regular (daily and weekly) observations by both the Zwicky Transient Facility and Las Cumbres Observatory over a 5 yr period indicates both periodic flares and variations in the apparent magnitude and color with a period of ∼26.5 days—likely the orbital period of this binary system. The periodic flaring suggests the stellar companion is a Be star, with flares resulting from increased accretion onto the neutron star (NS) when it enters the stellar decretion disk. The periodic variations in the optical/IR brightness and color likely result from orbital variations in the hydrogen column density along the line of sight or a transient accretion disk around the NS. Lastly, the numerous short-duration episodes where IC 10 X-2 is significantly “redder” or “bluer” than normal likely result from clumps within this system—which can accrete onto the NS (causing IC 10 X-2 to appear bluer) or pass through the line of sight (causing IC 10 X-2 to appear redder). These results substantially increase our understanding of the evolution of this source, which is a significant source of ionizing photons in its host galaxy IC 10, a low-mass, metal-poor starburst galaxy similar in many respects to those thought to be common in the early Universe.

<title>The Deuterium Fractionation of NH3 in Massive Star-forming Regions</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8444</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Deuteration is sensitive to environmental conditions in star-forming regions. To investigate NH2D chemistry, we compared the spatial distribution of ortho-NH2D , NH3(1,1), and NH3(2,2) in 12 late-stage massive star-forming regions. By averaging several pixels along the spatial slices of ortho-NH2D , we obtained the deuterium fractionation of NH3. In seven targets, the deuterium fractionation of NH3 shows a decreasing trend with increasing rotational temperature. This trend is less clear in the remaining five sources, likely due to limited spatial resolution. However, when considering all 12 sources together, the anticorrelation between NH3 deuterium fractionation and rotational temperature becomes less significant, suggesting that other physical parameters may influence the fractionation. Additionally, we found that the region of highest deuterium fractionation of NH3 is offset from the NH3 peak in each source, likely because the temperature is higher near the NH3 peaks and NH2D may be depleted from the gas phase as the molecular cloud core evolves, as well as the increased release of CO from grains into the gas phase.

<title>The NANOGrav 15 Yr Data Set: Removing Pulsars One by One from the Pulsar Timing Array</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Evidence has emerged for a stochastic signal correlated among 67 pulsars within the 15 yr pulsar-timing data set compiled by the NANOGrav collaboration. Similar signals have been found in data from the European, Indian, Parkes, and Chinese pulsar timing arrays. This signal has been interpreted as indicative of the presence of a nanohertz stochastic gravitational-wave background (GWB). To explore the internal consistency of this result, we investigate how the recovered signal strength changes as we remove the pulsars one by one from the data set. We calculate the signal strength using the (noise-marginalized) optimal statistic, a frequentist metric designed to measure the correlated excess power in the residuals of the arrival times of the radio pulses. We identify several features emerging from this analysis that were initially unexpected. The significance of these features, however, can only be assessed by comparing the real data to synthetic data sets. After conducting identical analyses on simulated data sets, we do not find anything inconsistent with the presence of a stochastic GWB in the NANOGrav 15 yr data. The methodologies developed here can offer additional tools for application to future, more sensitive data sets. While this analysis provides an internal consistency check of the NANOGrav results, it does not eliminate the necessity for additional investigations that could identify potential systematics or uncover unmodeled physical phenomena in the data.

<title>The Long-term Evolution of the Solar Transition Region</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Long-term evolution characteristics of the solar transition region have been unclear. In this study, daily images of the solar full disk derived from the observations by the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly at 304 Å wavelength from 2011 January 1 to 2022 December 31 are used to investigate the long-term evolution of the solar transition region. It is found that long-term variation in the transition region of the full disk is in phase with the solar activity cycle, and thus the polar brightening should occur in the maximum epoch of the solar cycle. Long-term variation of the background transition region is found to be likely in antiphase with the solar activity cycle at middle and low latitudes. The entire transition region, especially the active transition region is inferred to be mainly heated by the active-region magnetic fields and the ephemeral-region magnetic fields, while the quieter transition region is believed to be mainly heated by network magnetic fields. Long-term evolution characteristics of various types of the magnetic fields at the solar surface are highly consistent with these findings, and thus provide an explanation for them.

<title>Comparison of the Origin of Short Gamma-Ray Bursts with or without Extended Emission</title>

The merger of compact binary stars produces short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs), involving channels such as neutron star–neutron star (BNS) and neutron star–black hole (NS–BH). The association between sGRB 170817A and gravitational wave GW170817 provides reliable evidence for the BNS channel. Some speculations suggest that sGRBs with extended emission (EE) may represent another distinct population. The offset is the distance between the GRB sky localization and the host galaxy center. We compared the offset distributions of these two types of samples (46 sGRBs with EE and 9 without EE samples) and found that they follow the same distribution. Utilizing nonparametric methods, we examined the luminosity function and formation rate of sGRBs without any assumptions. The luminosity function can be described as for ( and for ) for sGRBs without EE and for ( and for ) for sGRBs with EE. The formation rate is characterized as ρ(z) ∝ (1 + z)−3.04±0.10 for z < 1 and as ρ(z) ∝ (1 + z)−0.29±0.38 for 1 < z < 3 for sGRBs without EE, while for sGRBs with EE, it is ρ(z) ∝ (1 + z)−3.85±0.15 for z < 1 and ρ(z) ∝ (1 + z)−0.40±1.11 for 1 < z < 3. Our findings suggest no significant difference in the progenitors of sGRBs with and without EE when considered in terms of spatial offsets, formation rates, and luminosity function.

<title>Detectability of Self-lensing Flares of White Dwarfs with Compact Companions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Binaries containing compact objects, viewed nearly edge on, can produce periodic brightening events under certain conditions on the masses, radii, and binary separation. Such flares are caused by one object gravitationally lensing another, in what is known as self-lensing flares. We present a simulation tool that efficiently reproduces the main features of self-lensing flares and facilitates a detection sensitivity analysis for various sky surveys. We estimate the detection prospects for a handful of representative surveys when searching for systems of either two white dwarfs or a white dwarf with other compact objects, i.e., neutron stars and black holes. We find only a marginal ability to detect such systems in existing surveys. However, we estimate many such systems could be detectable by surveys in the near future, including the Vera Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We provide a quantitative analysis of the detectability of double-compact object self-lensing flares across the landscape of system parameters, and a qualitative discussion of survey and follow-up approaches to distinguish such flares from confounding events, such as stellar flares, satellite glints, and cosmic rays. We estimate 0.3, 3 and 247 double white dwarf systems could be detected by Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, Zwicky Transient Facility, and LSST, respectively. A similar number of systems with a neutron star or black hole companion could be detected, but we caution that the number densities of such binaries is model dependent and so are our detection estimates. Such binaries can be used to constrain models of the end states of binary evolution.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We implement a standard thin disk model with the outer disk radius (Rout) as a free parameter, integrating it into a standard X-ray fitting package to enable self-consistent and simultaneous fitting of X-ray spectra and Ultraviolet (UV), Optical, and Near-infrared (NIR) photometry. We apply the model to the late-time data (Δt ≈ 350–1300 days) of the tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN–14li. We show that at these late times, the multiwavelength emission of the source can be fully described by a bare compact accretion disk. We obtain a black hole mass (MBH) of , consistent with host-galaxy scaling relations, and an Rout of 45 ± 13 Rg, consistent with the circularization radius, with possible expansion at the latest epoch. We discuss how simplistic models, such as a single-temperature blackbody fitted to either X-ray spectra or UV/optical photometry, lead to erroneous interpretations of the scale/energetics of TDE emission. We also apply the model to the soft/high state of the intermediate-mass black hole candidate HLX–1. The model fits the full spectral energy distribution (from X-rays to NIR) without needing an additional stellar population component. We investigate how relativistic effects improve our results by implementing a version of the model with full ray tracing calculations in the Kerr metric. For HLX–1, we find and Rout ≈ few × 103Rg, in agreement with previous findings. The relativistic model can constrain the inclination (i) of HLX–1 to be 10° ≤ i ≤70°.

<title>Characterizing Stellar and Gas Properties in NGC 628: Spatial Distributions, Radial Gradients, and Resolved Scaling Relations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Building on our previous research involving multiwavelength data from UV to IR, we employ spectroscopic observations of ionized gas, as well as neutral hydrogen gas obtained from the Five-hundred Meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), to explore the intrinsic processes of star formation and chemical enrichment within NGC 628. Our analysis focuses on several key properties, including gas-phase extinction, star formation rate (SFR) surface density, oxygen abundance, and H i mass surface density. The azimuthal distributions of these parameters in relation to the morphological and kinematic features revealed by FAST H i reveal that NGC 628 is an isolated galaxy that has not undergone recent interactions. We observe a mild radial extinction gradient accompanied by a notable dispersion. The SFR surface density also shows a gentle radial gradient, characteristic of typical spiral galaxies. Additionally, we find a negative radial metallicity gradient of −0.44 dex , supporting the “inside-out” scenario of galaxy formation. We investigate the resolved mass–metallicity relation (MZR) and the resolved star formation main sequence (SFMS) alongside their dependences on the physical properties of both ionized and neutral hydrogen gas. Our findings indicate no secondary dependence of the resolved MZR on SFR surface density or H i mass surface density. Furthermore, we observe that gas-phase extinction and the equivalent width of Hα both increase with SFR surface density in the resolved SFMS.

We present JWST NIRCam imaging targeting 13 z ~ 3 infrared-luminous (LIR ∼ 5 × 1012L⊙) galaxies from the ALESS survey with uniquely deep, high-resolution (0 08–0 16) Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array 870 μm imaging. The 2.0–4.4 μm (observed frame) NIRCam imaging reveals the rest-frame near-infrared stellar emission in these submillimeter-selected galaxies at the same (sub)kiloparsec resolution as the 870 μm dust continuum. The newly revealed stellar morphologies show striking similarities with the dust continuum morphologies at 870 μm, with the centers and position angles agreeing for most sources, clearly illustrating that the spatial offsets reported previously between the 870 μm and Hubble Space Telescope morphologies were due to strong differential dust obscuration. The F444W sizes are 78% ± 21% larger than those measured at 870 μm, in contrast to recent results from hydrodynamical simulations that predict larger 870 μm sizes. We report evidence for significant dust obscuration in F444W for the highest-redshift sources, emphasizing the importance of longer-wavelength MIRI imaging. The majority of the sources show evidence that they are undergoing mergers/interactions, including tidal tails/plumes—some of which are also detected at 870 μm. We find a clear correlation between NIRCam colors and 870 μm surface brightness on ∼1 kpc scales, indicating that the galaxies are primarily red due to dust—not stellar age—and we show that the dust structure on ∼kpc scales is broadly similar to that in nearby galaxies. Finally, we find no strong stellar bars in the rest-frame near-infrared, suggesting the extended bar-like features seen at 870 μm are highly obscured and/or gas-dominated structures that are likely early precursors to significant bulge growth.

<title>A New Approach to Constraining Properties of Active Galactic Nucleus Host Galaxies by Combining Image and Spectral Energy Distribution Decomposition: Testing upon the M BH–M ⋆ Relation</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9aa3</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The outshining light from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) poses significant challenges in studying the properties of AGN host galaxies. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that combines image decomposition and spectral energy distribution (SED) decomposition to constrain the properties of AGN host galaxies. Image decomposition allows us to disentangle optical flux into AGN and stellar components, thereby providing additional constraints on the SED models to derive a more refined stellar mass. To test the viability of this approach, we obtained a sample of 24 X-ray-selected type I AGNs with redshifts ranging from 0.73 to 2.47. We estimated the stellar masses for our sample and found that our results are generally consistent with earlier estimates based on different methods. Through examining the posterior distribution of stellar masses, we find that our method could derive better-constrained results compared to previous SED decomposition methods. With the derived stellar masses, we further studied the MBH–M⋆ relation of our sample, finding a higher intrinsic scatter in the correlation for our entire sample compared to the local quiescent correlation, which could be caused by a few “black hole monsters” in our sample. We propose that, based on our method, future works could extend to larger samples of high-redshift AGN host galaxies, thereby enhancing our understanding of their properties.

<title>SN 2014C: A Metamorphic Supernova Exploded in the Intricate and Hydrogen-rich Surroundings</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of supernova (SN) SN 2014C, primarily emphasizing the initial month after the explosion at approximately daily intervals. During this time, it was classified as a Type Ib SN exhibiting a notably higher peak luminosity (Lpeak ≈ 4.3 × 1042 erg s−1), a faster rise to brightness (trise ≈ 11.6 days), and a more gradual dimming ( mag) compared to typical Type Ib SNe. Analysis of the velocity evolution over the first ~20 days after the explosion supports the view that the absorption near 6200 Å is due to high-velocity Hα in the outer layers of the ejecta, indicating the presence of a small amount of hydrogen in the envelope of the progenitor before the explosion. Assuming that the peak luminosity is entirely attributed to radioactive decay, we estimate that 0.14 M⊙ of 56Ni was synthesized in the explosion. However, this amount of nickel could no longer maintain observed brightness approximately 10 days after peak luminosity, suggesting additional energy sources beyond radioactive decay. This supplementary energy likely originates from interaction with the circumstellar medium (CSM). Consequently, the timing of the SN−CSM interaction in SN 2014C may occur much earlier than the emergence of Type IIn−like features during the nebular phase.

<title>Constraining Anisotropic Diffusion between Geminga and Earth with the Cosmic-Ray Electron and Positron Spectrum</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The gamma-ray halo around Geminga indicates significant suppression of cosmic-ray diffusion. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is the projection effect of slow diffusion perpendicular to the mean magnetic field (characterized by the diffusion coefficient D⊥) within an anisotropic diffusion framework. In this scenario, the diffusion coefficient parallel to the mean field (D∥) can still be large, enabling electrons and positrons (e±) produced by Geminga to efficiently travel to Earth along the magnetic field lines, possibly resulting in a detectable e± flux. In this work, we first determine the basic parameters of the anisotropic model using the morphology and spectral measurements of the Geminga halo and then predict the flux of e± produced by Geminga at the location of Earth. We find that the e− + e+ spectrum of DAMPE can give crucial constraint on the anisotropic diffusion model: to ensure that the predicted spectrum does not exceed the measurements, the Alfvén Mach number of the turbulent magnetic field (MA) should not be less than 0.75, corresponding to D∥/D⊥ ≲ 3 given that . This implies that a significant suppression of D∥ relative to the average value in the Galaxy may still be necessary. Furthermore, we find that under the anisotropic diffusion model, Geminga can produce a very sharp feature around 1 TeV in the e− + e+ spectrum, which could naturally explain the peculiar 1.4 TeV excess tentatively observed by DAMPE.

<title>H i Intensity Mapping Cross-correlation with Thermal Sunyaev–Zel’dovich Fluctuations: Forecasted Cosmological Parameter Estimation for FAST and Planck</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The 21 cm emission from neutral hydrogen surveys holds great potential as a valuable method for exploring the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe. In this paper, we forecast for the cross-correlation between the thermal Sunyaev–Zel’dovich (SZ) fluctuations as probed by the Planck satellite and fluctuations in the H i brightness temperature as probed by the ground-based Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope to trace the connection between galaxy clusters and the H i LSS. Assuming that the measurement is limited by instrumental noise rather than by foreground, we estimate the potential detectability of the cross-correlation signal and the improvement in the measurement of the H i cosmic density, the hydrostatic mass bias parameter, and the universal pressure profile parameters. We obtain a constraint on the cosmic neutral hydrogen density parameter significantly to σ(ΩH I) = 1.0 × 10−6. We also find that the average halo masses contributing to the H i − y cross-power spectrum in the one-halo regime is ∼1.5 × 1014M⊙. Our results also show that the H i–SZ cross-correlation has great potential to probe the distribution of neutral hydrogen (H i) within halos at low redshift.

<title>Dwarf Galaxies with Radio-excess Active Galactic Nuclei in the Very Large Array Sky Survey</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a systematic search for radio active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dwarf galaxies using recent observations taken by the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS). To select these objects, we first establish a criterion to identify radio-excess AGNs using the infrared-radio correlation parameter, q, that describes the tight relation between radio and IR emission in star-forming galaxies. We find a 2σ threshold of q < 1.94 to select radio-excess AGNs, which is derived from a sample of ∼7000 galaxies across the full mass range in the NASA-Sloan Atlas that have radio and IR detections from VLASS and the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer, respectively. We create catalogs of radio-excess AGNs and star-forming galaxies and make these available to the community. Applying our criterion to dwarf galaxies with stellar masses M⋆ ≲ 3 × 109 M⊙ and redshifts z ≤ 0.15, and carefully removing interlopers, we find 10 radio-excess AGNs with radio-optical positional offsets between ∼0″ and 2.′3 (0–2.7 kpc). Based on statistical arguments and emission line diagnostics, we expect the majority of these radio-excess AGNs to be associated with the dwarf host galaxies rather than background AGNs. Five of the objects have evidence for hosting AGNs at other wavelengths, and five objects are identified as AGNs in dwarf galaxies for the first time. We also identify eight variable radio sources in dwarf galaxies by comparing the VLASS epoch 1 and epoch 2 observations to Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters detections presented in A. E. Reines et al. (2020).

<title>Dependence of SYMH Change Rate on Dynamic Pressure during the Main Phases of Storms: A Comparative Analysis of the 2024 May and 2003 November Superstorms</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We denote the variation in the SYMH index during the main phase of a geomagnetic storm as ΔSYMH and the duration of the storm's main phase as Δt. The ratio ΔSYMH/Δt represents the averaged rate of change of the ring current throughout the main phase of the storm. We analyzed the ΔSYMH/Δt ratios during the main phases of the 2024 May superstorm (referred to as storm1) and the 2003 November superstorm (referred to as storm2), followed by a comparison of the solar wind parameters that significantly influenced the main phases of these two events. We discovered that the ΔSYMH/Δt ratio for storm1 exceeded that of storm2. Additionally, the time integral of the solar wind electric field during the main phase of storm1 was less than that of storm2, which suggests that ΔSYMH/Δt is not solely determined by the solar wind electric field. Our findings also indicated that the average dynamic pressure during the main phase of storm1 was larger than that of storm2, highlighting the significance of dynamic pressure as a key parameter in influencing the variation of the ring current during the main phase of a geomagnetic storm.

<title>Radio Follow-up Observations of SN 2023ixf by Japanese and Korean Very Long Baseline Interferometers</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9a62</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report on radio follow-up observations of the nearby Type II supernova SN 2023ixf, spanning from 1.7 to 269.9 days after the explosion, conducted using three very long baseline interferometers (VLBIs), which are the Japanese VLBI Network, the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry, and the Korean VLBI Network. In three observation epochs (152.3, 206.1, and 269.9 days), we detected emission at the 6.9 and 8.4 GHz bands, with a flux density of ~5 mJy. The flux density reached a peak at around 206.1 days, which is longer than the timescale to reach the peak observed in typical Type II supernovae. Based on an analytical model of radio emission, our late-time detections were inferred to be due to decreasing optical depth. In this case, the mass-loss rate of the progenitor is estimated to have increased from ~10−6–10−5M⊙ yr−1 to ~10−4M⊙ yr−1 between 28 and 6 yr before the explosion. Our radio constraints are also consistent with the mass-loss rate needed to produce a confined circumstellar medium proposed by previous studies, which suggest that the mass-loss rate increased from ~10−4M⊙ yr−1 to ≳10−2M⊙ yr−1 in the last few years before the explosion.

<title>Spherical Accretion in the Schwarzschild Spacetime in the Newtonian Analogous Construct</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad901f</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad901f</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The velocity-dependent Newtonian analogous potentials (NAPs) corresponding to general relativistic (GR) spacetimes accurately capture most of the relativistic features, including all classical tests of GR, effectively representing spacetime geometries in Newtonian terms. The NAP formulated by Tejeda & Rosswog (TR13) for Schwarzschild spacetime has been applied to the standard thin accretion disk around a black hole (BH) as well as in the context of streamlines of noninteracting particles accreting onto a Schwarzschild BH, showing good agreement with the exact relativistic solutions. As a further application, here we explore the extent to which TR13 NAP could describe a transonic hydrodynamical spherical accretion flow in Schwarzschild spacetime within the framework of standard Newtonian hydrodynamics. Instead of obtaining a typical single “saddle-type” sonic transition, a “saddle–spiral pair” is produced, with the inner sonic point being an (unphysical) “spiral type” and the outer being a usual “saddle type.” The Bondi accretion rate at outer sonic radii, however, remains consistent with that of the GR case. The primary reason for the deviation of our findings from the classical Bondi solution is likely due to the inconsistency between the Euler-type equation in the presence of velocity-dependent TR13 NAP within the standard Newtonian hydrodynamics framework, and the corresponding GR Euler equation, regardless of the fluid’s energy. Our study suggests that a (modified) hydrodynamical formalism is needed to effectively implement such potentials in transonic accretion studies that align with the spirit of TR13 like NAP, while remaining consistent with the GR hydrodynamics. This could then essentially circumvent GR hydrodynamics or GR magnetohydrodynamics equations

<title>Chemical Fingerprints of M Dwarfs: High-resolution Spectroscopy on 31 M Dwarfs with SPIRou</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We extend the methodology introduced by F. Jahandar et al. to determine the effective temperature and chemical abundances of 31 slowly rotating solar neighborhood M dwarfs (M1–M5) using high-resolution spectra from CFHT/SPIRou. This group includes 10 M dwarfs in binary systems with FGK primaries of known metallicity from optical measurements. By testing our Teff method on various synthetic models, we find a consistent inherent synthetic uncertainty of ∼10 K at a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 100. Additionally, we find that our results align with interferometric measurements, showing a consistent residual of −29 ± 31 K. Taking the inherent uncertainties into account, we infer the Teff values of our targets and find an excellent agreement with previous optical and near-infrared studies. Our high-resolution chemical analysis examines hundreds of absorption lines using χ2 minimization using PHOENIX-ACES stellar atmosphere models. We present elemental abundances for up to 10 different elements, including refractory elements such as Si, Mg, and Fe, which are important for modeling the interior structure of exoplanets. In binary systems, we find an average [Fe/H] of −0.15 ± 0.08 for M dwarfs, marginally lower than the reported metallicity of −0.06 ± 0.18 for the FGK primaries from A. W. Mann et al. We also observe slightly subsolar chemistry for various elements in our nonbinary M dwarfs, most notably for O, C, and K abundances. In particular, we find an average metallicity of −0.11 ± 0.16, lower but still consistent with the typical solar metallicity of FGK stars (e.g., [Fe/H] = 0.04 ± 0.20 from J. M. Brewer et al. 2016). This study highlights significant discrepancies in various major M dwarf surveys likely related to differences in the methodologies employed.

Gravitational waves (GWs) from merging compact objects encode direct information about the luminosity distance to the binary. When paired with a redshift measurement, this enables standard-siren cosmology: a Hubble diagram can be constructed to directly probe the Universe’s expansion. This can be done in the absence of electromagnetic measurements, as features in the mass distribution of GW sources provide self-calibrating redshift measurements without the need for a definite or probabilistic host galaxy association. This “spectral siren” technique has thus far only been applied with simple parametric representations of the mass distribution, and theoretical predictions for features in the mass distribution are commonly presumed to be fundamental to the measurement. However, the use of an inaccurate representation leads to biases in the cosmological inference, an acute problem given the current uncertainties in true source population. Furthermore, it is commonly presumed that the form of the mass distribution must be known a priori to obtain unbiased measurements of cosmological parameters in this fashion. Here, we demonstrate that spectral sirens can accurately infer cosmological parameters without such prior assumptions. We apply a flexible, nonparametric model for the mass distribution of compact binaries to a simulated catalog of 1000 GW signals, consistent with expectations for the next LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA observing run. We find that, despite our model’s flexibility, both the source mass model and cosmological parameters are correctly reconstructed. We predict a 11.2%✎ measurement of H0, keeping all other cosmological parameters fixed, and a 6.4%✎ measurement of H(z = 0.9)✎ when fitting for multiple cosmological parameters (1σ uncertainties). This astrophysically agnostic spectral siren technique will be essential to arrive at precise and unbiased cosmological constraints from GW source populations.

<title>The Rapid Formation of the Metal-poor Milky Way</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Our understanding of the assembly timeline of the Milky Way has been transforming along with the dramatic increase in astrometric and spectroscopic data available over the past several years. Many substructures in chemo-dynamical space have been discovered and identified as the remnants of various galactic mergers. To investigate the timeline of these mergers, we select main-sequence turnoff and subgiant stars (MSTOs) from the H3 survey, finding members in seven metal-poor components of the halo: Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus (GSE), the Helmi Streams, Thamnos, Sequoia, Wukong/LMS-1, Arjuna, and I’itoi. We also select out a metal-poor in situ population to facilitate comparison to the evolution of the Milky Way itself at these early epochs. We fit individual isochrone ages to the MSTOs in each of these substructures and use the resulting age distributions to infer simple star formation histories (SFHs). For GSE, we resolve an extended SFH that truncates ≈10 Gyr ago, as well as a clear age–metallicity relation. From this age distribution and measured SFH we infer that GSE merged with the Milky Way at a time 9.5–10.2 Gyr ago, in agreement with previous estimates. We infer that the other mergers occurred at various times ranging from 9 to 13 Gyr ago, and that the metal-poor in situ Galaxy built up within only a few billion years. These results reinforce the emerging picture that both the disk and halo of the Milky Way experienced a rapid assembly.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The identification of strong gravitational lenses is essential to facilitate many studies in astronomy. The search for strong gravitational lenses has become more challenging because of their scientific value and their rarity. In this paper, we construct a data set for strong gravitational lensing searches that consist of known lenses and lens candidates from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Imaging Surveys (the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys) and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and non-lenses from the Legacy Surveys Data Release 9 (DR9). We apply the YOLOX algorithm as the basic framework and improve it by selecting the optimal optimizer, activation function, attention mechanism, and loss function. The improved YOLOX-LS algorithm achieves 97.87%, 97.51%, 0.97, 96.8%, and 53.1% in the evaluation metrics of precision, recall, F1 score, mean average precision (mAP)@0.5, and mAP@0.5:0.95, respectively. Compared with the YOLOX model, it improves by 0.63%, 0.26%, and 0.6% in the three metrics of precision, recall, and mAP@0.5, respectively. This paper presents the results of the trained YOLOX-LS algorithm applied to 4.75 million cutout images. These images are centered on the central source with magz ≤ 20 in the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey footprint from DESI DR9. Finally, we find 1697 lenses, including 303 known lenses or candidates, and 1394 new candidates, among which there are 102 high-quality candidates. This further verifies that the YOLOX-LS algorithm proposed in this paper can be effectively applied to the search for strong gravitational lenses. All visual results are displayed online at https://github.com/Young-mmm/YOLOX-LS.

<title>Derivation and Application of a Scaling between Hinode/SP and SDO/HMI Vector Magnetic Fields to Improve Magnetic Field Extrapolations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Full-disk measurements of the solar magnetic field by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) are often used for magnetic field extrapolations, but its limited spatial and spectral resolution can lead to significant errors. We compare HMI data with observations of NOAA 12104 by the Hinode Spectropolarimeter (SP) to derive a scaling curve for the magnetic field strength, B. The SP data in the Fe i lines at 630 nm were inverted with the SIR code. We find that the Milne–Eddington inversion of HMI underestimates B and the line-of-sight flux, Φ, in all granulation surroundings by an average factor of 4.5 in plage and 9.2 in the quiet Sun in comparison to the SP. The deviation is inversely proportional to the magnetic fill factor, f, in the SP results. We derived a correction curve to match the HMI B with the effective flux Bf in the SP data that scaled HMI B up by 1.3 on average. A comparison of non-force-free field extrapolations over a larger field of view without and with the correction revealed minor changes in connectivity and a proportional scaling of electric currents and Lorentz force (∝B ∼ 1.3) and free energy (∝B2 ∼ 2). Magnetic field extrapolations of HMI vector data with large areas of plage and quiet Sun will underestimate the photospheric magnetic field strength by a factor of 5–10 and the coronal magnetic flux by at least a factor of 2. An HMI inversion including a fill factor would mitigate the problem.

<title>Hot Spot Offset Variability from Magnetohydrodynamical Thermoresistive Instability in Hot Jupiters</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Hot Jupiter (HJ) atmospheres are possibly subject to a thermoresistive instability (TRI). Such an instability may develop as the ohmic heating increases the electrical conductivity in a positive feedback loop, which ultimately leads to a runaway of the atmospheric temperature. We extend our previous axisymmetric one-dimensional radial model, by representing the temperature and magnetic diffusivity as a first-order Fourier expansion in longitude. This allows us to predict the hot spot offset during the rapid unfolding of the TRI and following Alfvénic oscillations. The instability is periodically triggered and damped within ≈10–40 days, depending on the magnetic field strength, with months of slow buildup between recurring bursts. We show a few representative simulations undergoing TRI, in which the peak flux offset varies between approximately ±60∘ on a timescale of a few days with potentially observable brightness variations. Therefore, this TRI could be an observable feature of HJs, given the right timing of observation and transit and the right planetary parameters.

<title>Strongly Magnetized Accretion with Low Angular Momentum Produces a Weak Jet</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9926</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the spherical accretion of magnetized plasma with low angular momentum onto a supermassive black hole, utilizing global general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Black hole-driven feedback in the form of magnetic eruptions and jets triggers magnetized turbulence in the surrounding medium. We find that when the Bondi radius exceeds a certain value relative to the black hole’s gravitational radius, this turbulence restricts the subsequent inflow of magnetic flux, strongly suppressing the strength of the jet. Consequently, magnetically arrested disks and powerful jets are not a generic outcome of the accretion of magnetized plasma, even if there is an abundance of magnetic flux available in the system. However, if there is significant angular momentum in the inflowing gas, the eruption-driven turbulence is suppressed (sheared out), allowing for the presence of a powerful jet. Both the initially rotating and nonrotating flows go through periods of low and high gas angular momentum, showing that the angular momentum content of the inflowing gas is not just a feature of the ambient medium, but is strongly modified by the eruption and jet-driven black hole feedback. In the lower-angular-momentum states, our results predict that there should be dynamically strong magnetic fields on horizon scales, but no powerful jet; this state may be consistent with Sgr A* in the Galactic center.

<title>Latitude Quenching Nonlinearity in the Solar Dynamo</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad99d0</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We compare two candidate nonlinearities for regulating the solar cycle within the Babcock–Leighton paradigm: tilt quenching (whereby the tilt of active regions is reduced in stronger cycles) and latitude quenching (whereby flux emerges at higher latitudes in stronger solar cycles). Digitized historical observations are used to build a database of individual magnetic plage regions from 1923 to 1985. The regions are selected by thresholding in Ca ii K synoptic maps, with polarities constrained using Mount Wilson Observatory sunspot measurements. The resulting data show weak evidence for tilt quenching, but much stronger evidence for latitude quenching. Further, we use proxy observations of the polar field from faculae to construct a best-fit surface flux transport model driven by our database of emerging regions. A better fit is obtained when the sunspot measurements are used, compared to a reference model where all polarities are filled using Hale's Law. The optimization suggests clearly that the “dynamo effectivity range” of the Sun during this period should be less than 10°; this is also consistent with latitude quenching being dominant over tilt quenching.

<title>Can Alfvénic Fluctuations Affect the Correlation and Complexity of Magnetic Field of Magnetic Ejecta? A Case Study Based on Multi-spacecraft Measurements at 1 au</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9a55</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate whether Alfvénic fluctuations (AFs) can affect the structure of magnetic ejecta (ME) within interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). We study an ICME observed on 2001 December 29 at 1 au by the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) and Wind, at a total angular separation of ~0 8 (~ 0.014 au). We focus on the correlation and complexity of its magnetic structure measured between two spacecraft in association with large-amplitude AFs. The Alfvénicity of the ME is investigated in terms of the residual energy and cross helicity of fluctuations. We find that as for the event of interest, large-amplitude AFs occur in the rear region of the ME at both Wind and ACE with a duration of about 6 hr. We compare the correlation of the magnetic field strength and vector components measured between Wind and ACE, and investigate complexity in terms of the magnetic hodograms. The region showing AFs is found to be associated with a decreased correlation of the magnetic field components and an increased complexity of the ME magnetic configuration detected at ACE and Wind, which may be due to the fact that the two spacecraft crossing the same ME along different trajectories likely sampled AFs in different oscillation phases. Combining multipoint in situ measurements and remote-sensing observations of the ICME source region, we further discuss different potential sources of the AFs.

The 21 cm forest is a sensitive probe for the early heating process and small-scale structures during the epoch of reionization (EOR), to be realized with the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Its detection relies on the availability of radio-bright background sources, among which the radio-loud quasars are very promising, but their abundance during the EOR is still poorly constrained due to limited observations. In this work, we use a physics-driven model to forecast future radio-loud quasar observations. We fit the parameters of the model using observational data of high-redshift quasars. Assuming Eddington accretion, the model yields an average lifetime of tq ~ 105.5 yr for quasars at z ~ 6, consistent with recent results obtained from quasar proximity zone observation. We show that if the radio-loud fraction of quasars evolves with redshift, it will significantly reduce the abundance of observable radio-loud quasars in the SKA era, making 21 cm forest studies challenging. With a constant radio-loud fraction, our model suggests that a 1 yr sky survey conducted with SKA-LOW has the capability to detect approximately 20 radio-loud quasars at z ~ 9, with sufficient sensitivity to resolve individual 21 cm forest lines.

<title>Extreme Solar Particle Ejection Event in the Last Few Million Years from Asteroid Itokawa Sample</title>

Unusual explosive activity occasionally occurs from the Sun, releasing large amounts of solar energetic particles. Extreme solar particle ejection events in the past 11,000 yr have been detected by sharp increases of cosmogenic isotopes in annual tree rings and ice cores. However, quantitative estimation of the event magnitudes is not straightforward, as the cosmogenic isotopes are indirect records of solar particles. Similar solar particle ejection events may also accumulate records in surface materials of airless bodies such as the Moon and asteroids. Samples from the asteroid 25143 Itokawa have been irradiated by solar winds for tens to hundreds of years at some points in the last few million years. Here, we report implantation profiles of solar particle He from an Itokawa regolith grain that trace an extreme solar particle ejection event. The implantation profiles indicate that the fluences of suprathermal solar particles were 250–1300 times larger than that expected from the current normal solar activity. Since the degrees of excesses are inversely related to the solar wind irradiation periods, the high-energy particle fluence would have been derived from a single event. The event was approximately 40 times larger than the 2003 Halloween solar storms, which is one of the largest solar particle ejection events observed since the space-based measurement of solar activity began. The event magnitude is similar to the largest events inferred from the cosmogenic isotope records in terrestrial samples. Our result provides direct evidence of an extreme solar particle ejection event in the last few million years.

<title>Detection of a Magnetic Discontinuity in the Upper Solar Chromosphere Associated with a Coronal Loop Brightening Observed by CLASP2.1</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the first detection of a magnetic discontinuity in the upper solar chromosphere associated with a coronal loop brightening. Our findings are based on novel observations obtained by the Chromospheric LAyer SpectroPolarimeter (CLASP2.1) suborbital space experiment. During its short 6 minute flight, CLASP2.1 successfully obtained spectropolarimetric data across the Mg ii h and k lines, which allowed us to map the longitudinal magnetic field at multiple heights in the chromosphere of a solar active region. During our observation, we found a coronal loop brightening that was intermittently and recurrently heated. The temperature of the brightening plasma is above 2.5 MK, which is higher than the ambient temperature, and no corresponding brightening is detected in the images of the photosphere and lower chromosphere. The notable finding of our study is that the coronal loop brightening of interest is observed across a region where the magnetic field polarity changes abruptly in the upper chromosphere. Our results provide observational evidence that the heating mechanism of the coronal loop brightening is consistent with magnetic reconnection in the upper solar chromosphere.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The plausibility of an unseen planet in the outer solar system, and the expected orbit and mass of such a planet, have long been a topic of inquiry and debate. We calculate the long-term orbital stability of distant trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), which allows us to expand the sample of objects that would carry dynamical information about a hypothetical unseen planet in the solar system. Using this expanded sample, we find statistically significant clustering at the ∼3σ level for TNOs with semimajor axes > 170 au in the longitude of perihelion (ϖ), but not in inclination (i), argument of perihelion (ω), or longitude of node (Ω). Since a natural explanation for clustering in ϖ is an unseen planet, we run 300 N-body simulations with the giant planets, a disk of test particles representing Kuiper Belt objects, and an additional planet with varied initial conditions for its mass, semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination. Based on the distribution of test particles after 1–2 Gyr, we compute relative likelihoods given the actual distribution of ϖ as a function of semimajor axis for distant TNOs on stable orbits using a significantly larger sample than previous work. We find the best-fit unseen planet parameters to have mass mp = 4.4 ± 1.1 M⊕, semimajor axis ap = 290 ± 30 au, eccentricity ep = 0.29 ± 0.13, and inclination ip = 6 8 ± 5 0. Only 0.06% of the M. E. Brown & K. Batygin Planet Nine reference population produce probabilities within 1σ of the maximum within our quadrivariate model, indicating that our work identifies a distinct preferred region of parameter space for an unseen planet in the solar system.

<title>A Catalog of Stellar and Dust Properties for 500,000 Stars in the Southwest Bar of the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8eb7</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a catalog of individual stellar and dust extinction properties along close to 500,000 sight lines in the southwest bar of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The catalog is based on multiband Hubble Space Telescope photometric data spanning near-ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths from the Small Magellanic Cloud Investigation of Dust and Gas Evolution survey (SMIDGE) covering a 100 × 200 pc area. We use the probabilistic technique of the Bayesian Extinction And Stellar Tool (BEAST) to model the spectral energy distributions of individual stars in SMIDGE and include the effects of observational uncertainties in the data. We compare BEAST-derived dust extinction properties with tracers of the interstellar medium, such as the emission from the 12CO (2–1) transition (I(CO)), the dust mass surface density (Σdust) from far-IR emission, the H i column density (N(H i)) from the 21 cm transition, and the mass fraction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; qPAH, derived from IR emission). We find that the dust extinction (A(V)) in the SMIDGE field is strongly correlated with Σdust and I(CO), and less so with N(H i) and qPAH, and suggest potential explanations. Our extinction measurements are also sensitive to the presence of the 2175 Å bump in the extinction curve toward UV bright stars. While most do not show evidence for the bump, we identify ∼200 lines of sight that are 2175 Å bump candidates. Furthermore, we find distinct structures in the dust extinction–distance distributions that provide insights into the 3D geometry of the SMC.

<title>Modeling Energetic Proton Transport from a Stream Interaction Region to Compound Streams</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad96ae</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad96ae</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Energetic proton events associated with a stream interaction region (SIR) were observed by two Solar-Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) and WIND spacecraft from 2007 September 19 to September 25. Different from the measurements of STEREO-A and WIND, the observational data of STEREO-B show additional particle intensity increases when the spacecraft is immersed into the compound stream region with poor compression signatures after the passage of the SIR. In order to investigate this particular event, we simulated proton transport with a solar wind pattern obtained from the two-dimensional analytical model driven by plasma and magnetic field data of the spacecraft. We find that the additional energetic proton event is not an autonomous event created by the compound streams and is closely associated with the accelerated particles in the preceding SIR structure. We highlight the variation in particle distribution as a function of radial distance within the SIR. The magnetic field configuration in the compound stream region observed by STEREO-B provides a more direct connection to the source particle region, which presents a view to explain the differences between the energetic proton observations of the three spacecraft.

<title>Observed Steep and Shallow Spectra, Narrow and Broadband Spectra, Multifrequency Simultaneous Spectra, and Statistical Fringe Spectra in Fast Radio Bursts: Various Faces of Intrinsic Quasi-periodic Spectra?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Through analysis, modelings, and simulations, we show that if the spectra of fast radio bursts (FRBs) are intrinsically quasi-periodic, and likely produced by coherent curvature radiation from quasi-periodic structured bunches, then the observed steep and shallow spectra, narrow and broadband spectra, multifrequency simultaneous spectra, as well as possible statistical fringe spectra in FRBs, could all be various manifestations of them. If so, the period properties of the structured bunches, as inferred from the observed multifrequency simultaneous spectra and potential statistical fringe spectra, may provide valuable insights into the mechanisms behind the formation of such structured bunches.

<title>PHANGS-ML: The Universal Relation between PAH Band and Optical Line Ratios across Nearby Star-forming Galaxies</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad972a</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad972a</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The structure and chemistry of the dusty interstellar medium (ISM) are shaped by complex processes that depend on the local radiation field, gas composition, and dust grain properties. Of particular importance are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which emit strong vibrational bands in the mid-infrared, and play a key role in the ISM energy balance. We recently identified global correlations between PAH band and optical line ratios across three nearby galaxies, suggesting a connection between PAH heating and gas ionization throughout the ISM. In this work, we perform a census of the PAH heating–gas ionization connection using ∼700,000 independent pixels that probe scales of 40–150 pc in 19 nearby star-forming galaxies from the PHANGS survey. We find a universal relation between PAH(11.3 μm/7.7 μm) and ([S ii]/Hα) with a slope of ∼0.2 and a scatter of ∼0.025 dex. The only exception is a group of anomalous pixels that show unusually high (11.3 μm/7.7 μm) PAH ratios in regions with old stellar populations and high starlight-to-dust emission ratios. Their mid-infrared spectra resemble those of elliptical galaxies. Active galactic nucleus hosts show modestly steeper slopes, with a ∼10% increase in PAH(11.3 μm/7.7 μm) in the diffuse gas on kiloparsec scales. This universal relation implies an emerging simplicity in the complex ISM, with a sequence that is driven by a single varying property: the spectral shape of the interstellar radiation field. This suggests that other properties, such as gas-phase abundances, gas ionization parameter, and grain charge distribution, are relatively uniform in all but specific cases.

<title>Emission Characteristics of Energetic Electrons with Crescent-shaped Velocity Distributions</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9905</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9905</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Solar flares release magnetic energy through reconnection, accelerating electrons into nonthermal velocity distributions, including crescent-shaped electron populations. These energetic electron distributions are crucial in driving instabilities that can lead to distinct electromagnetic emissions. This study investigates the emission properties of crescent-shaped electron velocity distribution functions under different frequency ratios (ωpe/Ωce), critical for understanding plasma conditions in various astrophysical environments, by comparing the emissions and intensities of waves among different cases. Here, we study and analyze three distinct frequency ratio conditions (2.2, 10, and 1, designated as cases A, B, and C, respectively). We find that the beam-Langmuir and upper-hybrid modes can be efficiently excited, leading to further plasma emissions in different cases. Our study reveals that the fundamental (O/F) emission can reach a maximum value of ∼10−4Ek0, while the harmonics (H) can extend to ∼1.5 × 10−5Ek0, depending on the frequency ratio of the environment. The intensity of the fundamental mode exceeds previous findings for pure-ring, pure-beam, and ring–beam distributions, highlighting the impact of crescent-shaped electron velocity distributions on wave excitation and emission processes. This effect is notably influenced by different frequency ratios, offering new insights into the way that nonthermal electron distributions affect the plasma emission process.

<title>In Search of Extraterrestrial Artificial Intelligence Through Dyson Sphere–like Structures around Primordial Black Holes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Are we alone? It is a compelling question that human beings have confronted for centuries. The search for extraterrestrial life is a broad range of quests for finding simple forms of life up to intelligent beings in the Universe. The plausible assumption is that there is a chance that intelligent life will be followed by advanced civilization equipped or even dominated by artificial intelligence (AI). In this work, we categorize advanced civilizations (on an equal footing, an AI-dominated civilization) on the Kardashev scale. We propose a new scale known as the space exploration distance to measure civilization advancement. We propose a relation between this length and the Kardashev scale. Then, we suggest the idea that advanced civilizations will use primordial black holes (PBHs) as sources of harvesting energy. We calculate the energy harvested by calculating the space exploration distance. Finally, we propose an observational method to detect the possibility of extraterrestrial AI using Dyson sphere–like structures around PBHs in the Milky Way and other galaxies.

<title>Ejective Feedback as a Quenching Mechanism in the First 1.5 Billion Years of the Universe: Detection of Neutral Gas Outflow in a z = 4 Recently Quenched Galaxy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The confirmation of massive quiescent galaxies emerging within the first billion years of the Universe poses intriguing questions about the mechanisms of galaxy formation. There must be highly efficient processes at work to shut down star formation in galaxies at cosmic dawn. I present the detection of neutral outflowing gas in a massive recently quenched galaxy at z = 4, showing ejective back as a quenching mechanism. Based on James Webb Space Telescope spectrum, the star formation rate (SFR) of this has been declining with a rapid e-folding timescale of ∼50 Myr. The current specific SFR is 5 × 10−11 yr−1, roughly 40 times lower than that of the star-forming main sequence at comparable redshifts. Emission-line ratios of [Ne iii]/[O ii] and [O iii]/Hβ are similar to active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at comparable redshifts. A series of Fe ii and Mg ii absorption lines appear blueshifted by ∼250 km s−1 relative to the stellar continuum, suggesting an outflow of neutral gas. The estimated mass outflow rate is approximately 7 times greater than the SFR derived from the stellar continuum, implying that the suppression of star formation is likely due to gas being depleted by the outflow. If the emission lines are AGN-driven, the AGN can also provide sufficient energy to launch the outflow observed. This galaxy represents the most distant example of its kind known to date. This study offers a compelling explanation for the existence of massive quiescent galaxies in the first billion years of the Universe.

<title>Automated Detection of Galactic Rings from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Images</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Morphological features in galaxies—like spiral arms, bars, rings, and tidal tails, etc.—carry information about their structure, origin, and evolution. It is therefore important to catalog and study such features and to correlate them with other basic galaxy properties, the environments in which the galaxies are located, and their interactions with other galaxies. The volume of present and future data on galaxies is so large that traditional methods, which involve expert astronomers identifying morphological features through visual inspection, are no longer sufficient. It is therefore necessary to use AI-based techniques like machine learning and deep learning to find morphological structures quickly and efficiently. We report in this study the application of deep learning for finding ring-like structures in galaxy images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR18. We use a catalog by R. J. Buta of ringed galaxies from SDSS to train the network, reaching good accuracy and recall, and generate a catalog of 29,420 galaxies, of which 4855 have ring-like structures with prediction confidence exceeding 90%. Using a catalog of barred galaxy images identified by S. Abraham et. al. with deep-learning techniques, we identify a set of 2087 galaxies with bars as well as rings. The catalog should be very useful in understanding the origin of these important morphological structures. As an example of the usefulness of the catalog, we explore the environments and star formation characteristics of the ring galaxies in our sample.

<title>Unveiling the Cosmic Chemistry: Revisiting the Mass–Metallicity Relation with JWST/NIRSpec at 4 < z < 10</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present star formation rates (SFRs), the mass–metallicity relation (MZR), and the SFR-dependent MZR across redshifts 4–10 using 81 star-forming galaxies observed by the JWST NIRSpec employing both low-resolution PRISM and medium-resolution gratings, including galaxies from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) GOODS-N and GOODS-S fields, the JWST-PRIMAL Legacy Survey, and additional galaxies from the literature in the A2744, SMACS-0723, RXJ2129, BDF, COSMOS, and MACS1149 fields. These galaxies span a 3 dex stellar mass range of 107 < M*/M⊙ < 1010, with an average SFR of 7.2 ± 1.2M⊙ yr−1 and an average metallicity of . Our findings align with previous observations up to z = 8 for the MZR and indicate no deviation from the local Universe fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) up to this redshift. Beyond z = 8, we observe a significant deviation (∼0.27 dex) in FMR, consistent with recent JWST findings. We also integrate Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (135 galaxies) and JADES (47 galaxies) samples with our data to study the metallicity evolution with redshift in a combined sample of 263 galaxies, revealing a decreasing metallicity trend with a slope of 0.067 ± 0.013, consistent with IllustrisTNG and EAGLE but contradicting the FIRE simulations. We introduce an empirical mass–metallicity–redshift relation: × , which accurately reproduces the observed trends in metallicity with both redshift and stellar mass. This trend underscores the “Grand Challenge” in understanding the factors driving high-redshift galactic metallicity trends, such as inflow, outflow, and active galactic nucleus/stellar feedback—and emphasizes the need for further investigations with larger samples and enhanced simulations.

<title>Shock Breakouts from Compact Circumstellar Medium Surrounding Core-collapse Supernova Progenitors May Contribute Significantly to the Observed ≳10 TeV Neutrino Background</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9a6b</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Growing observational evidence suggests that enhanced mass loss from the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) is common during ~1 yr preceding the explosion, creating an optically thick circumstellar medium (CSM) shell at ~1014.5 cm radii. We show that if such mass loss is indeed common, then the breakout of the SN shock through the dense CSM shell produces a neutrino flux that may account for a significant fraction of the observed ≳10 TeV neutrino background. The neutrinos are created within a few days from the explosion, during and shortly after the shock breakout, which produces also large UV (and later X-ray) luminosity. The compact size and large UV luminosity imply a pair production optical depth of ~104 for > 100 GeV photons, naturally accounting for the lack of a high-energy gamma-ray background accompanying the neutrino background. SNe producing >1 neutrino event in a 1 km2 detector are expected at a rate of ≲0.1 yr−1. A quantitative theory describing the evolution of the electromagnetic spectrum during a breakout, as the radiation-mediated shock is transformed into a collisionless one, is required to enable (i) using data from upcoming surveys that will systematically detect large numbers of young, <1 day old SNe to determine the preexplosion mass-loss history of the SN progenitor population, and (ii) a quantitative determination of the neutrino luminosity and spectrum.

<title>EDGE-INFERNO: Simulating Every Observable Star in Faint Dwarf Galaxies and Their Consequences for Resolved-star Photometric Surveys</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Interpretation of data from faint dwarf galaxies is made challenging by observations limited to only the brightest stars. We present a major improvement to tackle this challenge by undertaking zoomed cosmological simulations that resolve the evolution of all individual stars more massive than 0.5 M⊙, thereby explicitly tracking all observable stars for the Hubble time. For the first time, we predict observable color–magnitude diagrams and the spatial distribution of ≈100,000 stars within four faint (M⋆ ≈ 105M⊙) dwarf galaxies directly from their cosmological initial conditions. In all cases, simulations predict complex light profiles with multiple components, implying that typical observational measures of structural parameters can make the total V-band magnitudes appear up to 0.5 mag dimmer compared to estimates from simulations. Furthermore, when only small (⪅100) numbers of stars are observable, shot noise from realizations of the color–magnitude diagram introduces uncertainties comparable to the population scatter in, e.g., the total magnitude, half-light radius, and mean iron abundance measurements. Estimating these uncertainties with fully self-consistent mass growth, star formation, and chemical enrichment histories paves the way for more robust interpretation of dwarf galaxy data.

<title>Identifying the Coronal Holes in Open Magnetic Field Regions Using Deep Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Open magnetic field (OMF) regions are the foot points of the field lines extending to infinity. While they are often considered to coincide with coronal holes (CHs), many studies have reported non-negligible inconsistency between the two. The objective of this study is to develop a deep learning model to predict the OMF regions that coincide with CHs, and to examine the importance of different physical quantities on the prediction. The CHs and OMF regions are both identified from the coronal data computed by a magnetohydrodynamic model developed by Predictive Science. Eight physical quantities, colatitude, magnetic flux expansion factor, magnetic field strength, thermal pressure, electron temperature, electron number density, mass density, and local coronal heating rate, at the OMF footpoints are used as the input to the deep learning model. The results of the test set indicate that the model improves the consistency between CHs and OMF regions from 0.33 to 0.81, and that all eight quantities are similarly important when they are all included in the model although the prediction accuracy would be most affected by excluding the colatitude and/or magnetic field strength. Comparison between the histograms of CH and non-CH open field regions indicates that each quantity alone can be used to distinguish the two within the ranges of values where one histogram is much higher than the other.

<title>Mass Transfer in Eccentric Black Hole–Neutron Star Mergers</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b87</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Black hole–neutron star binaries are of interest in many ways: they are intrinsically transient, radiate gravitational waves detectable by LIGO, and may produce γ-ray bursts. Although it has long been assumed that their late-stage orbital evolution is driven entirely by gravitational wave emission, we show here that in certain circumstances, mass transfer from the neutron star onto the black hole can both alter the binary's orbital evolution and significantly reduce the neutron star's mass: when the fraction of its mass transferred per orbit is ≳10−2, the neutron star's mass diminishes by order unity, leading to mergers in which the neutron star mass is exceptionally small. The mass transfer creates a gas disk around the black hole before merger that can be comparable in mass to the debris remaining after merger, i.e., ~0.1 M⊙. These processes are most important when the initial neutron star–black hole mass ratio q is in the range ≈0.2–0.8, the orbital semimajor axis is 40 ≲ a0/rg ≲ 300 (rg ≡ GMBH/c2), and the eccentricity is large at e0 ≳ 0.8. Systems of this sort may be generated through the dynamical evolution of a triple system, as well as by other means.

Component-separation algorithms operating in both the spatial and harmonic domains are applied to probe their consistency and to quantify modeling errors associated with their assumptions. Analyses of diffuse Galactic dust emission spanning the full Spider region demonstrate (i) a spectral energy distribution that is broadly consistent with a modified-blackbody (MBB) model with a spectral index of βd = 1.45 ± 0.05 (1.47 ± 0.06) for E (B)-mode polarization, slightly lower than that reported by Planck for the full sky; (ii) an angular power spectrum broadly consistent with a power law; and (iii) no significant detection of line-of-sight polarization decorrelation. Tests of several modeling uncertainties find only a modest impact (∼10% in σr) on Spider’s sensitivity to the cosmological tensor-to-scalar ratio. The size of the Spider region further allows for a statistically meaningful analysis of the variation in foreground properties within it. Assuming a fixed dust temperature Td = 19.6 K, an analysis of two independent subregions of that field results in inferred values of βd = 1.52 ± 0.06 and βd = 1.09 ± 0.09, which are inconsistent at the 3.9σ level. Furthermore, a joint analysis of Spider and Planck 217 and 353 GHz data within one subregion is inconsistent with a simple MBB at more than 3σ, assuming a common morphology of polarized dust emission over the full range of frequencies. This evidence of variation may inform the component-separation approaches of future cosmic microwave background polarization experiments.

<title>Understanding the Radio Emission from the β Cep Star V2187 Cyg</title>

We analyze the radio emission from the β Cep star V2187 Cyg using archive data from the Jansky Very Large Array. The observations were made in ten epochs at 1.39 and 4.96 GHz in the highest angular resolution A configuration. We determine a spectral index of of α = 0.6 ± 0.2 (Sν ∝ να), consistent with an ionized wind or a partially optically thick synchrotron or gyrosynchrotron source. The emission is spatially unresolved at both frequencies. The 4.96 GHz data show a radio pulse with a duration of about one month that can be modeled in terms of an internal shock in the stellar wind produced by a sudden increase in the mass-loss rate and the terminal velocity. The quiescent radio emission of V2187 Cyg at 4.96 GHz (with a flux density of ≃150 μJy) cannot be explained in terms of an internally (by V2187 Cyg) or externally (by a nearby O star) photoionized wind. We conclude that, despite the spectral index suggestive of free–free emission from an ionized wind, the radio emission of V2187 Cyg most likely has a magnetic origin, a possibility that can be tested with a sensitive search for circular polarization in the radio, as expected from gyrosynchrotron radiation and also by trying to measure the stellar magnetic field, which is expected to be in the range of several kilogauss.

<title>Observational Evidence for a Correlation between the Magnetic Field of Jets and Star Formation Rate in Host Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Accretion supermassive black holes in the center of active galaxies usually produce “jet”-collimated bipolar outflows of relativistic particles. Magnetic fields near the black hole event horizon may play a crucial role in the formation of jets/outflows. Both theory and observation indicate that jets/outflows driven by centrally active supermassive black holes have a feedback effect on the overall properties of the host galaxies. Therefore, the magnetic field is a key ingredient for the formation and evolution of galaxies. Here, we report a clear correlation between the magnetic field of jets and star formation rate for a large sample of 96 galaxies hosting supermassive black holes, which suggests that the star formation of active galactic nuclei host galaxies may be powered by the jets.

<title>CO Observations of the Type Ia Supernova Remnant 3C 397 by the Nobeyama 45 m Radio Telescope: Possible Evidence for the Single-degenerated Explosion</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a new CO observation toward the Type Ia supernova remnant 3C 397 using the Nobeyama 45 m radio telescope at an unprecedented angular resolution of ∼18″. We newly found that the CO cloud at VLSR = 55.7–62.2 km s−1 (60 km s−1 cloud) shows a good spatial correspondence with the radio continuum shell. We also found an expanding gas motion of the 60 km s−1 cloud with an expansion velocity of ∼3 km s−1, which is thought to be formed by the pre- and/or postsupernova feedback. By considering the positions of Galactic spiral arms and the X-ray/H i absorption studies, we concluded that 3C 397 is physically associated with the 60 km s−1 cloud rather than the previously known CO cloud at VLSR ∼ 30 km s−1. Given that the previously measured preshock density is ∼2–5 cm−3, the expanding motion of the 60 km s−1 cloud was likely formed by the presupernova feedback known as optically thick wind. The scenario is consistent with the fact that 3C 397 exploded inside a wind-blown bubble as a single degenerate system.

<title>Detecting Solar Flare Precursors Using DEFT</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Detection and EUV Flare Tracking (DEFT) tool automatically identifies flare precursors in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations in a fast and consistent manner, with minimal computational overhead. DEFT currently uses GOES/SUVI 304 Å observations to detect, group, and flag sudden impulses that could be precursors to flares. In this study, we analyzed precursor signatures before 351 flares (150 C, 150 M, and 51 X class flares) that occurred from 2017 to date. Across these magnitudes, precursors were detected for 93% of the flares when using a 6 hr window before the flare start times. Using superposed epoch analysis, we found that elevated precursor activity tends to occur across all magnitude flares in the last 2 hr before the flares. The frequency of precursors gradually increases before M class flares but decreases for C class flares. We also found that in the last 20 minutes there is a significantly higher precursor frequency, pixel count, and power associated with M class flares than C class flares. We suggest that the observed EUV precursors are the observable signatures of small-scale magnetic reconnection events, and the consistently increasing frequency of precursor activity could indicate that the region is becoming increasingly unstable and reaching a critical stage that could result in flare initiation. Continuing research on EUV precursors is essential to better understand preflare processes that build and reduce magnetic instability prior to main-stage flares. The consistent and reliable detection and differentiation of EUV precursors could also complement and significantly improve current flare forecasting efforts.

<title>Polarization of Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglows in the Context of Non-axisymmetric Structured Jets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
As the most energetic explosion in the Universe, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are usually believed to be generated by relativistic jets. Some mechanisms (e.g., internal nonuniform magnetic dissipation processes or the precession of the central engine) may generate asymmetric jet structures, which are characterized by multiple fluctuations in the light curve of the afterglow. Since the jet’s structure introduces asymmetry in radiation around the line of sight (LOS), it is naturally expected that polarization will be observable. In this work, we reveal the polarization characteristics of GRB afterglows with a non-axisymmetric structured jet. Our results show that the afterglow signal generally exhibits polarization, with the degree and evolution influenced by the specific jet structure, observing frequency, and the LOS. The polarization degree is notably higher when the LOS is outside the jet. This degree fluctuates over time as different regions of radiation alternate in their dominance, which is accompanied by the rotation of the polarization angle and further reflects the intricate nature of the jet. Regarding its evolution over frequency, the polarization degree displays significant fluctuations at spectral breaks, with the polarization angle possibly undergoing abrupt changes. These features may provide strong evidence for the future identification of potential GRBs with asymmetric jet structures.

<title>Distinguishability of a Naked Singularity from a Black Hole in Dynamics and Radiative Signatures</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Can a naked singularity (NkS) be distinguished from a black hole (BH)? We have investigated it with cutting-edge general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, followed by general relativistic radiation transfer calculation for magnetized accretion flow around NkS and BHs. Based on our simulations, the accreting matter close enough to the singularity repels due to effective potential. This prevents matter from reaching an NkS and forms a quasi-spherical symmetric density distribution around it, unlike the accretion flows around a BH. We observe 1 order of magnitude higher mass flux through the jet and much stronger wind from an NkS than a BH. We found that the jet launching mechanism in an NkS differs significantly from that in a BH. In the horizon-scale images, an NkS shows a photon arc instead of a photon ring that is shown around a BH. In summary, the flow dynamics and radiative properties around an NkS are distinctly different from a BH. These properties would be useful to either confirm or rule out such exotic compact objects through future observations.

<title>Morphology and Mach Number Distribution of Merger Shock Surfaces in Merging Galaxy Clusters</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In a binary merger of two subclusters with comparable masses, a pair of merger shocks are typically generated, often manifesting as double radio relics. Using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, we identify major merger events with mass ratio and impact parameter b/rvir,1 ≲ 1, where rvir,1 is the virial radius of the heavier subcluster. We analyze merger shock surfaces approximately 1 Gyr after the pericenter passage, focusing on their morphology and the distribution of the Mach number, Ms, of their constituent shock zones. The shock surfaces exhibit an elongated shape with a minor-to-major axis ratio of ∼0.6–0.9 and cover the area of ∼5%−20% of the enclosed sphere. The area ratio of the two shock surfaces roughly scales as , typically positioning the larger shock ahead of the lighter subcluster. The axis connecting the two subclusters generally does not pass through the centers of the shock surfaces, due to the nonzero impact parameter and ambient turbulent flows. The distribution of Ms of shock zones on each surface can be approximated by a log-normal function, peaking at Ms,peak ≈ 2−4.5 and extending up to ∼10. The surface-area-weighted and X-ray- emissivity-weighted average Mach numbers are comparable, with and . In contrast, the cosmic-ray energy flux-weighted average Mach numbers are higher with . This discrepancy aligns with the differences between Mach numbers derived from X-ray and radio observations of radio relic shocks. On the other hand, we find that mostly for simulated merger shocks, although shocks with MX-ray ≲ 2 are often reported in observations.

<title>B2 1308+326: A Changing-look Blazar or Not?</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b7c</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9b7c</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In our previous study, we identified a shift in the synchrotron peak frequency of the blazar B2 1308+326 from 1012.9 to 1014.8 Hz during a flare, suggesting it could be a changing-look blazar (CLB). In this work, we investigate the changing-look behaviour of B2 1308+326 by analysing a newly acquired optical spectrum and comparing it with an archival spectrum. We find that between the two epochs, the continuum flux increased by a factor of ~4.4, while the Mg ii emission line flux decreased by a factor of 1.4 ± 0.2. Additionally, the equivalent width of the Mg ii line reduced from ~20 to ~3 Å, indicating an apparent shift from a flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) class to a BL Lacertae (BL Lac) class. Despite this apparent change, the ratio of accretion disk luminosity to Eddington luminosity remains >10−2 during both epochs, indicating efficient accretion persists in B2 1308+326. The measured black hole mass remains consistent with an average M⊙. Our findings suggest that B2 1308+326 is not a genuine CLB but rather an intrinsic FSRQ that emerges as a BL Lac during high-flux states due to enhanced nonthermal emission.

<title>The NuSTAR Local AGN N H Distribution Survey (NuLANDS). I. Toward a Truly Representative Column Density Distribution in the Local Universe</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Hard X-ray-selected samples of active galactic nuclei (AGN) provide one of the cleanest views of supermassive black hole accretion but are biased against objects obscured by Compton-thick gas column densities of NH > 1024 cm−2. To tackle this issue, we present the NuSTAR Local AGN NH Distribution Survey (NuLANDS)—a legacy sample of 122 nearby (z < 0.044) AGN primarily selected to have warm infrared colors from IRAS between 25 and 60 μm. We show that optically classified Type 1 and 2 AGN in NuLANDS are indistinguishable in terms of optical [O iii] line flux and mid-to-far-infrared AGN continuum bolometric indicators, as expected from an isotropically selected AGN sample, while Type 2 AGN are deficient in terms of their observed hard X-ray flux. By testing many X-ray spectroscopic models, we show the measured line-of-sight column density varies on average by ∼1.4 orders of magnitude depending on the obscurer geometry. To circumvent such issues, we propagate the uncertainties per source into the parent column density distribution, finding a directly measured Compton-thick fraction of 35% ± 9%. By construction, our sample will miss sources affected by severe narrow-line reddening, and thus segregates sources dominated by small-scale nuclear obscuration from large-scale host-galaxy obscuration. This bias implies an even higher intrinsic obscured AGN fraction may be possible, although tests for additional biases arising from our infrared selection find no strong effects on the measured column density distribution. NuLANDS thus holds potential as an optimized sample for future follow-up with current and next-generation instruments aiming to study the local AGN population in an isotropic manner.

<title>Extending the ALMA Census of Circumstellar Disks in the Upper Scorpius OB Association</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 7 continuum (340 GHz) and carbon monoxide (CO) J = 3–2 observations for an extended sample of disks in the Upper Scorpius OB Association (Upper Sco, age ∼10 Myr). The targets were selected from previous studies that identified new members of Upper Sco using photometry and astrometry from the Gaia mission, and the presence of a disk has been inferred from mid-infrared excess emission. The new ALMA observations are combined with previous ALMA data to define a sample of 202 Upper Sco members with disks that have spectral types between G0 and M5.5. Among these sources, 120 (59%) have been detected in the continuum with a signal-to-noise ratio ≥3, and 83 (41%) have been detected in CO J = 3–2. Both the continuum and CO J = 3–2 fluxes show a strong correlation with the spectral type of the central star and the type of disk inferred from the shape of the infrared spectral energy distribution, where disks around earlier-type stars and full disks are more luminous than disks around later-type stars and evolved and debris disks. The median dust continuum luminosity is lower for disks in Upper Sco than in younger regions, as found in previous studies, where the differences are more pronounced in later spectral types (M4–M5) than in earlier spectral types.

<title>Multiple Rebrightenings in the Optical Afterglow of GRB 210731A: Evidence for an Asymmetric Jet</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The broadband afterglow of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is usually believed to originate from the synchrotron radiation of electrons accelerated by the external shock of relativistic jets. Therefore, the jet structure should have a significant impact on the GRB afterglow features. The latest observations indicate that the GRB jets may possess intricate structures, such as Gaussian structure, power-law structure, or jet-cocoon structure. Most recently, an abnormal afterglow of GRB 210731A has raised extensive attention, whose optical afterglow exhibits multiple rebrightening phenomena within 4 hr, posing a serious challenge to the standard afterglow model. Here we intend to interpret the characteristics of GRB 210731A afterglows within the framework of nonaxisymmetric structured jets, where multiple distinct peaks in the afterglow light curve are caused by the uneven distribution of energy and velocity within the jet in the azimuth angle direction. Through Markov Chain Monte Carlo fitting, we show that a three-component asymmetric structured jet can well explain the multiband afterglow data. The energy difference among the three components is about 2.3 orders of magnitude, with higher-energy components exhibiting faster speeds. The radiation contribution of each component has sequentially dominated the light curve of the afterglow, resulting in multiple peaks, with the highest peak occurring at the latest time. We suggest that in the future, polarization observations should be conducted on afterglows with multiple brightening signatures, which will help to effectively distinguish the structured jet model from other alternative models, such as energy injection, and ultimately help to determine the true configuration of jets.

<title>Combining Direct Black Hole Mass Measurements and Spatially Resolved Stellar Kinematics to Calibrate the M BH–σ ⋆ Relation of Active Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The origin of the tight scaling relation between the mass of supermassive black holes (SMBHs; MBH) and their host-galaxy properties remains unclear. Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) probe phases of ongoing SMBH growth and offer the only opportunity to measure MBH beyond the local Universe. However, determining an AGN's host galaxy's stellar velocity dispersion, σ⋆, and its galaxy dynamical mass, Mdyn, is complicated by AGN contamination, aperture effects, and different host-galaxy morphologies. We select a sample of AGNs for which MBH has been independently determined to high accuracy by state-of-the-art techniques: dynamical modeling of the reverberation signal and spatially resolving the broad-line region with the Very Large Telescope Interferometer/GRAVITY. Using integral-field spectroscopic observations, we spatially map the host-galaxy stellar kinematics across the galaxy and bulge effective radii. We find that the dynamically hot component of galaxy disks correlates with MBH; however, the correlations are tightest for aperture-integrated σ⋆ measured across the bulge. Accounting for the different MBH distributions, we demonstrate—for the first time—that AGNs follow the same MBH–σ⋆ and MBH–Mbulge,dyn relations as quiescent galaxies. We confirm that the classical approach of determining the virial factor as a sample average, yielding , is consistent with the average f from individual measurements. The similarity between the underlying scaling relations of AGNs and quiescent galaxies implies that the current AGN phase is too short to have altered black hole masses on a population level. These results strengthen the local calibration of f for measuring single-epoch MBH in the distant Universe.

<title>A Search for Asymmetric Kinematic Components in Circumstellar Envelopes Using OH Main Line Masers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Circumstellar OH maser lines are useful for studying the dynamics of the circumstellar envelope (CSE) around evolved stars. This study aims to identify CSEs around cold stars, which exhibit deviations from the spherical expansion, by comparing the velocity ranges of the OH main lines (1665/1667 MHz) with those of the satellite line (1612 MHz), using a database of circumstellar OH maser sources. We performed this comparison for 377 circumstellar OH maser sources. In addition, using infrared two-color diagrams, we examined the evolutionary stages and infrared properties of objects showing velocity excess (velocity excess means the detection of the main lines outside the velocity range of the satellite line). A periodicity analysis of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) light curves was also carried out. As a result of the velocity range comparison, eight circumstellar OH maser sources were found to exhibit velocity excess. The infrared colors of these objects match those of postasymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Periodic variations were observed in the WISE light curves of five of these eight objects. The results suggest that examining the velocity excess of the main lines relative to the satellite line is scientifically significant because mainline masers probe the CSE dynamics over a broader range of evolutionary stages compared to the 22.235 GHz H2O maser line. Additionally, during the post-AGB phase, the emission regions of the mainline and 22.235 GHz H2O masers may overlap in a CSE, whereas they originate from different regions during the AGB phase.

<title>Virgo Filaments. IV. Using WISE to Measure the Modification of Star-forming Disks in the Extended Regions Around the Virgo Cluster</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent theoretical work and targeted observational studies suggest that filaments are sites of galaxy preprocessing. The aim of the WISESize project is to directly probe galaxies over the full range of environments to quantify and characterize extrinsic galaxy quenching in the local universe. In this paper, we use GALFIT to measure the IR 12 μm (R12) and 3.4 μm (R3.4) effective radii of 603 late-type galaxies in and surrounding the Virgo cluster. We find that Virgo cluster galaxies show smaller star-forming disks relative to their field counterparts at the 2.5σ level, while filament galaxies show smaller star-forming disks to almost 1.5σ. Our data, therefore, show that cluster galaxies experience significant effects on their star-forming disks prior to their final quenching period. There is also tentative support for the hypothesis that galaxies are preprocessed in filamentary regions surrounding clusters. On the other hand, galaxies belonging to rich groups and poor groups do not differ significantly from those in the field. We additionally find hints of a positive correlation between stellar mass and size ratio for both rich group and filament galaxies, though the uncertainties on these data are consistent with no correlation. We compare our size measurements with the predictions from two variants of a state-of-the-art semi-analytic model (SAM), one which includes starvation and the other incorporating both starvation and ram pressure stripping (RPS). Our data appear to disfavor the SAM, which includes RPS for the rich group, filament, and cluster samples, which contributes to improved constraints for general models of galaxy quenching.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this study, we perform detailed spectroscopic modeling to analyze the interaction of circumstellar material (CSM) with ejecta in both hydrogen-rich and hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), by systematically varying properties such as the CSM density, composition, and geometry to explore their effects on spectral lines and light-curve evolution. Using advanced radiative transfer simulations with the new, open-source SuperLite code to generate synthetic spectra, we identify key spectroscopic indicators of CSM characteristics. Our findings demonstrate that spectral lines of hydrogen and helium exhibit significant variations due to differences in CSM mass and composition. In hydrogen-rich Type II SLSNe, we observe pronounced hydrogen emission lines that correlate strongly with a dense, extended CSM, suggesting massive, eruptive mass-loss histories. Conversely, in hydrogen-poor SLSNe, we recover mostly featureless spectra at early times, with weak hydrogen lines appearing only in the very early phases of the explosion, highlighting the quick ionization of traces of hydrogen present in the CSM. We analyze the properties of the resulting emission lines, particularly Hα and Hβ, for our models using sophisticated statistical methods. This analysis reveals how variations in the SN progenitor and CSM properties can lead to distinct spectroscopic evolutions over time. These temporal changes provide crucial insights into the underlying physics driving the explosion and the subsequent interaction with the CSM. By linking these spectroscopic observations to the initial properties of the progenitor and its surrounding material, our study offers a useful tool for probing the pre-explosion histories of these explosive events.

We present the large-scale distribution and kinematics of cold molecular gas across the compact galaxy group Stephan’s Quintet, based on CO(2–1) observations performed with the Atacama Compact Array (ACA) and CO(1–0) data from the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA). We find coherent structures of molecular gas associated with the galaxies and intragroup medium, which follow the distribution of warm H2 previously seen with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). CO is associated with a ridge of shocked gas that crosses the galaxy group, and with a spiral arm of the intruding galaxy NGC 7318b, which interacts with the intragroup medium along the ridge. Although the ridge contains widespread shocks, turbulent gas, and warm H2, the CO lines are narrower than elsewhere in Stephan’s Quintet (FWHM ∼ 25–65 km s−1), indicative of settled cold gas. At a distinctly different velocity, CO is found in the active galaxy NGC 7319 and northern star-forming region SQ-A. A bridge of turbulent molecular gas connects NGC 7319 with the ridge, covering a gap of ∼700 km s−1 between these structures. The gas excitation ranges from / ∼ 0.3 in the bridge and SQ-A, to ∼0.5 along the ridge, to near unity in the center of NGC 7319. We also detect either a molecular outflow or turbulent molecular gas associated with the radio source in NGC 7319. These ACA data are part of a program with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and JWST to study the physics of molecular gas from the largest to the smallest scales across the intragroup medium of Stephan’s Quintet.

<title>Finding the Fuse: Prospects for the Detection and Characterization of Hydrogen-rich Core-collapse Supernova Precursor Emission with the LSST</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Enhanced emission in the months to years preceding explosion has been detected for several core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Though the physical mechanisms driving the emission remain hotly debated, the light curves of detected events show long-lived (≥50 days), plateau-like behavior, suggesting hydrogen recombination may significantly contribute to the total energy budget. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will provide a decade-long photometric baseline to search for this emission, both in binned pre-explosion observations after an SN is detected and in single-visit observations prior to the SN explosion. In anticipation of these searches, we simulate a range of eruptive precursor models to core-collapse SNe and forecast the discovery rates of these phenomena in LSST data. We find a detection rate of ∼40–130 yr−1 for SN IIP/IIL precursors and ∼110 yr−1 for SN IIn precursors in single-epoch photometry. Considering the first three years of observations with the effects of rolling and observing triplets included, this number grows to a total of 150–400 in binned photometry, with the highest number recovered when binning in 100 day bins for 2020tlf-like precursors and in 20 day bins for other recombination-driven models from the literature. We quantify the impact of using templates contaminated by residual light (from either long-lived or separate precursor emission) on these detection rates, and explore strategies for estimating baseline flux to mitigate these issues. Spectroscopic follow-up of the eruptions preceding core-collapse SNe and detected with LSST will offer important clues to the underlying drivers of terminal-stage mass loss in massive stars.

<title>Electrostatic Transport Characteristics of Olivine Particles under Electron Irradiation in Vacuum</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Electrostatic dust transport on airless planetary bodies, such as the Moon, plays a crucial role in shaping their surface environment and influencing the evolution of surface materials. To investigate the effects of electron irradiation on the transport characteristics of micron-sized dust particles under simulated lunar conditions, we measured the diameters and velocities of moving olivine particles using a laser Doppler system. Experiments were conducted under electron irradiation with energies up to 500 eV and currents ranging from 1 to 500 μA. The results demonstrate a strong dependence of electrostatic dust migration on the incident electrons’ energy and current, with more pronounced effects observed at higher energies. This offers insights into the mechanisms behind localized dust migration during magnetic tail crossings and in the lunar terminal/polar plasma wakes, where electrostatic charging likely plays a key role. However, further observations are necessary to verify these phenomena fully. Olivine particles exhibited significantly higher transport rates than anorthite particles under the same conditions, confirming the distinct transport characteristics of various dust components. Furthermore, based on the patched charge model, we examined the driving force and initial vertical velocity distribution to better understand the mechanisms behind dust lofting. These findings provide valuable insights into dust transport mechanisms on airless planetary surfaces, with implications for future space exploration missions and environmental modeling.

<title>Thorium in Kilonova Spectra: Exploring the Heaviest Detectable Element</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad96b3</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Kilonova spectra provide us with direct information about rapid neutron-capture nucleosynthesis (r-process) in neutron star (NS) mergers. In this paper, we study the signatures of elements beyond the third r-process peak expected to be produced in neutron-rich ejecta in the photospheric spectra of kilonova. We select Ra ii, Ac iii, and Th iii as our candidates because they have a small number of valence electrons and low-lying energy levels, which tend to result in strong absorption features. We systematically calculate the strength of bound–bound transitions of these candidates by constructing a line list based on the available atomic database. We find that Th iii is the most promising species, showing strong transitions at near-infrared wavelengths. By performing radiative transfer simulations, we find that Th iii produces broad absorption features at ∼18000 Å in the spectra when the mass ratio of actinides to lanthanides is larger than the solar r-process ratio and the mass fraction of lanthanides is ≲6 × 10−4. Our models demonstrate that the Th feature may be detectable if the bulk of the ejecta in the line-forming region is dominated by relatively light r-process elements with the mixture of a small fraction of very neutron-rich material. Such conditions may be realized in the mergers of unequal-mass NSs or black hole–NS binaries. To detect the Th absorption features, observations from space (such as with the JWST) or high-altitude sites are important as the wavelength region of the Th features overlaps with that affected by strong telluric absorption.

<title>RAMSES-yOMP: Performance Optimizations for the Astrophysical Hydrodynamic Simulation Code RAMSES</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Developing an efficient code for large, multiscale astrophysical simulations is crucial in preparing for the upcoming era of exascale computing. RAMSES is an astrophysical simulation code that employs parallel processing based on the message-passing interface (MPI). However, it has limitations in computational and memory efficiency when using a large number of CPU cores. The problem stems from inefficiencies in workload distribution and memory allocation that inevitably occur when a volume is simply decomposed into domains equal to the number of working processors. We present RAMSES-yOMP, which is a modified version of RAMSES designed to improve parallel scalability. Major updates include the incorporation of open multiprocessing into the MPI parallelization to take advantage of both the shared and distributed memory models. Utilizing this hybrid parallelism in high-resolution benchmark simulations with full prescriptions for baryonic physics, we achieved an increase in performance by a factor of 2 in the total run-time, while using 75% less memory and 30% less storage than the original code, when using the same number of processors. These improvements allow us to perform larger or higher-resolution simulations than what was feasible previously.

<title>Marginal Role of the Electrostatic Instability in the GeV-scale Cascade Flux from 1ES 0229+200</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Relativistic pair beams produced in the intergalactic medium by TeV gamma rays from blazars are expected to generate a detectable GeV-scale electromagnetic cascade, yet this cascade is absent in the observed spectra of hard-spectrum TeV emitting blazars. This suppression is often attributed to weak intergalactic magnetic fields (IGMF) deflecting electron-positron pairs out of the line of sight. Alternatively, it has been proposed that beam-plasma instabilities could drain the energy of the beam before they produce the secondary cascades. Recent studies suggest that the modification of beam distribution due to these instabilities is primarily driven by particle scattering, rather than energy loss. In this paper, we quantitatively assess, for the blazar 1ES 0229+200, the arrival time of secondary gamma rays at Earth from the beam scattering by the electrostatic instability. We first computed the production rates of electron-positron pairs at various distances using the Monte Carlo simulation CRPropa. We then simulated the feedback of the plasma instability on the beam, incorporating production rates and inverse Compton cooling, to determine the steady-state distribution function. Our findings reveal that the time delay of the GeV secondary cascade arrival due to instability broadening is on the order of a few months. This delay is insufficient to account for the missing cascade emission in blazar spectra, suggesting that plasma instabilities do not significantly affect IGMF constraints.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This paper gives an overview of Targeting Extremely Magnified Panchromatic Lensed Arcs and Their Extended Star formation (TEMPLATES), a JWST Early Release Science program that targeted four extremely bright, gravitationally lensed galaxies, two extremely dusty and two with low attenuation, as templates for galaxy evolution studies with JWST. TEMPLATES obtains a common set of spectral diagnostics for these 1.3 ≤ z ≤ 4.2 galaxies, in particular Hα, Paschen α, and the rest-frame optical and near-infrared continua. In addition, two of the four targets have JWST coverage of [O iii] 5007 Å and Hβ; the other two targets have JWST coverage of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon 3.3 μm and complementary Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array data covering the [C ii] 158 μm emission line. The science goals of TEMPLATES are to demonstrate attenuation-robust diagnostics of star formation, map the distribution of star formation, compare the young and old stellar populations, and measure the physical conditions of star formation and their spatial variation across the galaxies. In addition, TEMPLATES has the technical goal to establish best practices for the integral field units within the NIRSpec and MIRI instruments, both in terms of observing strategy and in terms of data reduction. The paper describes TEMPLATES’s observing program, scientific and technical goals, data reduction methods, and deliverables, including high-level data products and data reduction cookbooks.

<title>C3PO. III. On the Lithium Signatures following Planet Engulfment by Stars</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8dc3</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8dc3</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Planet engulfment has been identified as one of the mechanisms for enhancing lithium abundance in stars. However, comprehensive investigations into lithium signatures following such events remain limited. Stars born together, sharing a common origin and stellar characteristics, provide a unique opportunity to study these signatures and compare lithium abundances. We demonstrate that the distinctive signature of planet engulfment in lithium abundance is only discernible among highly similar stellar twins. We present lithium abundance measurements for 125 comoving pairs of stars, representing the largest sample to date with a single, homogeneous assessment of high-precision lithium abundance. While lithium abundance enhancements in pairs showing planet engulfment signatures are within 0.35 dex, we find that even at fixed stellar parameters (temperature and age), the intrinsic scatter in lithium abundance is typically 0.35 dex for G/F dwarfs and can be as large as 0.6 dex for older and cooler stars due to internal stellar evolution processes. Since the planet engulfment signature from lithium can be masked by stellar intrinsic scatter, our findings raise questions about relying solely on lithium as an indicator for planet engulfment or attributing lithium-richness in stars primarily to planet engulfment events.

Spider pulsars represent a unique subclass of radio millisecond pulsars in binaries, and are further categorized into black widows and redbacks according to the mass of the low-mass companion. These pulsars, observable across multiple wavelengths, exhibit periodic variability in optical. The discovery and study of additional spider-type pulsars are crucial for a fuller understanding the evolution of binary stars in close orbits and the recycling theory of millisecond pulsars. In this work, we systematically searched for spider pulsar binary systems using time-domain variability data from the Zwicky Transient Facility and unassociated gamma-ray sources from the Fermi 4FGL-DR3 catalog. We developed a time-domain data processing pipeline that employs the Lomb–Scargle periodogram algorithm. As a result, we identified a total of 194 ellipsoidal variables and irradiation-type binary stars. Further refinement using the Gaia Hertzsprung–Russell diagram resulted in a selection of 24 spider pulsar candidates. Incorporating the 4FGL 95% confidence error ellipse reduced the sample to 19 candidates. An additional filter using the Gaia color-reduced proper motion diagram yielded nine “gold sample” candidates. These newly identified spider pulsar candidates will guide future observational campaigns in radio, X-ray, and optical spectroscopy, aiding in the comprehensive validation of their nature.

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad944e</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigated the temporal and spectral features of γ Cassiopeiae’s X-ray emission within the context of the white dwarf (WD) accretion hypothesis. We find that the variabilities present in the X-ray data show two different signals, one primarily due to absorption and the other due to flickering like in nonmagnetic cataclysmic variables. We then use this two-component insight to investigate previously unreported simultaneous XMM and NuSTAR data. The results of model fitting find WD properties consistent with optical studies alongside a significant secondary, thermal source. We propose a secondary shock between the Be decretion disk and WD accretion disk as the source. Finally, we analyzed a unique, low-count-rate event of the XMM light curve as potential evidence for the WD encountering Be decretion disk structures.

<title>Constraining the Binarity of Massive Black Holes in the Galactic Center and Some Nearby Galaxies via Pulsar Timing Array Observations of Gravitational Waves</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Massive black holes (MBHs) exist in the Galactic center (GC) and other nearby galactic nuclei. As a natural outcome of galaxy mergers, some MBHs may have a black hole (BH) companion. In this paper, assuming that the MBHs in the GC and some nearby galaxies are in binaries with orbital periods ranging from months to years (gravitational-wave frequency ∼1–100 nHz), we investigate the detectability of gravitational waves from these binary MBHs (BBHs) and constraints on the parameter space for the existence of BBHs in the GC, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), M31, M32, and M87 that may be obtained by current/future pulsar timing array (PTA) observations. We find that a BBH in the GC, if any, can be revealed by the Square Kilometre Array PTA (SKA-PTA) if it has mass ratio q ≳ 10−4–10−3 and semimajor axis a ∼ 20–103 au. The existence of a BH companion of the MBH can be revealed by SKA-PTA with ∼20 yr observations in M31 if q ≳ 10−4 and a ∼ 102–104 au or in M87 if q ≳ 10−5 and a ∼ 103–2 × 104 au, but not in the LMC and M32 if q ≪ 1. If a number of millisecond stable pulsars with distances ≲0.1–1 pc away from the central MBH in the GC, the LMC, M32, or M31 can be detected in future and applied to PTAs, a BH companion with mass even down to ∼100 M⊙, close to stellar masses, can be revealed by such PTAs. Future PTAs are expected to provide an independent way to reveal BBHs and low-mass MBH companions in the GC and nearby galaxies, improving our understandings of the formation and evolution of MBHs and galaxies.

<title>Warped Accretion Disks and Quasars with Episodic Periodicity of Long-term Variations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
It has been found from long-term monitoring campaigns that some quasars are undergoing quasiperiodic variations (most of them with damped amplitudes) in optical bands, but how to explain the origin of such light-curve variations still remains an open question. In this paper, we use the warped accretion disks model to explain the quasiperiodical variations. This model employs a free-bending wave traveling in an accretion disk, which causes the orientation of the central part of the disk to oscillate from the line of sight, resulting in a quasiperiodical variation. We numerically solve the governing equation of warp propagation and calculate the simulated R-band light curves, finding that the periodical light curves generated by this model have damped amplitudes. To compare with observations, we select SDSSJ134820.42+194831.5 as a preliminary example from a sample of periodic quasar candidates by combining CRTS with other public survey data and fitting its light curve with different observational angles. Our result gives a reduced χ2 ≃ 2.4, implying that the model might give insights into the future application of the warped disk model.

High-z radio galaxies (HzRGs) are considered important objects for understanding the formation and evolution of massive galaxies in the early Universe. However, until to date, detailed studies of the stellar population of HzRGs, such as the star formation history, have been scarce. Therefore, this study conducted a new survey to establish a less-biased sample of HzRGs and consequently investigate their properties. We utilized a sample of g-dropout Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) obtained from an optical wide and deep imaging survey made by Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam. Based on the cross matching of this LBG sample with the Very Large Array Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm radio survey data, we constructed a photometric sample of HzRGs at z ∼ 4 for a ∼560 deg2 survey field. Consequently, we identified 146 HzRG candidates. To analyze the characteristics of these candidates, we focus on objects exhibiting the near-infrared photometry of VIKING or UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey and the mid-infrared photometry of unWISE (28 objects). The results indicate that seven objects exhibit spectral energy distributions (SEDs) consistent with galaxies at z ∼ 4. The HzRG candidates have very large stellar masses with ∼4.2 × 1011M⊙ on average. This stellar mass is similar to that of previously discovered ultra-steep-spectrum HzRGs at z ∼ 4, though our sample is affected by a sample selection bias that selects only HzRGs with M⋆ > 1011M⊙. Further, the SEDs of those HzRG candidates suggest a past fast quenching with a rough timescale of ∼0.1 Gyr, as evidenced from the rest-frame UVJ diagram.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We combine the power of blind integral field spectroscopy from the Hobby–Eberly Telescope (HET) Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) with sources detected by the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) to construct the HETDEX-LOFAR Spectroscopic Redshift Catalog. Starting from the first data release of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey, including a value-added catalog with photometric redshifts, we extracted 28,705 HETDEX spectra. Using an automatic classifying algorithm, we assigned each object a star, galaxy, or quasar label along with a velocity/redshift, with supplemental classifications coming from the continuum and emission-line catalogs of the internal, fourth data release from HETDEX (HDR4). We measured 9087 new redshifts; in combination with the value-added catalog, our final spectroscopic redshift sample is 9710 sources. This new catalog contains the highest substantial fraction of LOFAR galaxies with spectroscopic redshift information; it improves archival spectroscopic redshifts and facilitates research to determine the [O ii] emission properties of radio galaxies from 0.0 < z < 0.5, and the Lyα emission characteristics of both radio galaxies and quasars from 1.9 < z < 3.5. Additionally, by combining the unique properties of LOFAR and HETDEX, we are able to measure star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses. Using the Visible Integral-field Replicable Unit Spectrograph, we measure the emission lines of [O iii], [Ne iii], and [O ii] and evaluate line-ratio diagnostics to determine whether the emission from these galaxies is dominated by active galactic nuclei or star formation and fit a new SFR–L150MHz relationship.

<title>Multiwavelength Properties of Infrared-faint Radio Sources Based on Analysis of Their Spectral Energy Distribution</title>

Infrared-faint radio sources (IFRSs) are believed to be a rare class of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) characterized by their high radio-to-infrared flux density ratios of up to several thousand. Previous studies have shown that a fraction of IFRSs are likely to be hosted in dust-obscured galaxies. In this paper, our aim is to probe the dust properties, star formation rate (SFR), and AGN activity of IFRSs by modeling the UV-to-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) of 20 IFRSs with spectroscopic redshifts ranging from 1.2 to 3.7. We compare the Bayesian evidence of a three-component model (stellar, AGN, and cold dust) with that of a two-component model (stellar and cold dust) for six IFRSs in our sample with far-infrared photometry and find that the three-component model has significantly higher Bayesian evidence, suggesting that IFRSs are most likely to be AGNs. The median SED of our IFRS sample shows similarities to an AGN–starburst composite in the IR regime. The derived IR luminosities of IFRSs indicate that they are low-luminosity counterparts of high-redshift radio galaxies. We disentangle the contributions of AGN-heated and star formation-heated dust to the IR luminosity of IFRSs and find that our sample is likely AGN-dominated. However, despite the evidence for significant impact of an AGN on the host galaxy, the AGN luminosity of our sample does not show correlation with the SFR of the sources.

<title>No Evidence for a Significant Evolution of M •–M. Relation in Massive Galaxies up to z ∼ 4</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Over the past two decades, tight correlations between black hole masses (M•) and their host galaxy properties have been firmly established for massive galaxies (with stellar mass ) at low-z (z < 1), indicating coevolution of supermassive black holes and galaxies. However, the situation at high-z, especially beyond cosmic noon (z ≳ 2.5), is controversial. With a combination of JWST Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam)/wide field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) from FRESCO, CONGRESS and deep multiband NIRCam/image data from JADES in the GOODS fields, we study the black-hole-to-galaxy mass relation at z ∼ 1–4. After identifying 18 broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at 1 < z < 4 (with 8 at z > 2.5) from the WFSS data, we measure their black hole masses based on broad near-infrared lines (Paα, Paβ, and He iλ10833 Å), and constrain their stellar masses from AGN-galaxy image decomposition or spectral energy distribution decomposition. Taking account of the observational biases, the intrinsic scatter of the M•−M* relation, and the errors in mass measurements, we find no significant difference in the M•/M* ratio for 2.5 < z < 4 compared to that at lower redshifts (1 < z < 2.5), suggesting no evolution of the M•−M* relation at up to z ∼ 4.

<title>Transiting Jupiters around M Dwarfs Have Similar Masses to FGK Warm Jupiters</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This paper presents a comparative analysis of the bulk properties (mass and radius) of transiting giant planets (≳8R⊕) orbiting FGKM stars. Our findings suggest that the average mass of M-dwarf Jupiters is lower than that of their solar-type counterparts, primarily due to the scarcity of super-Jupiters (≳2 MJ) around M dwarfs. However, when super-Jupiters are excluded from the analysis, we observe a striking similarity in the average masses of M-dwarf and FGK warm-Jupiters. We propose that these trends can be explained by a minimum disk dust mass threshold required for Jovian formation through core accretion, which is likely to be satisfied more often around higher-mass stars. This simplistic explanation suggests that the disk mass has more of an influence on giant planet formation than other factors, such as the host star mass, formation location, metallicity, radiation environment, etc., and also accounts for the lower occurrence of giant planets around M-dwarf stars. Additionally, we explore the possibility of an abrupt transition in the ratio of super-Jupiters to Jupiters around F-type stars at the Kraft break, which could be a product of vsini-related detection biases, but requires additional data from an unbiased sample with published nondetections to confirm. Overall, our results provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of giant exoplanets across a diverse range of stellar environments.

<title>Conditions for Solar Prominence Formation Triggered by Single Localized Heating</title>

We performed numerical simulations to study mechanisms of solar prominence formation triggered by a single heating event. In the widely accepted “chromospheric-evaporation condensation” model, localized heating at footpoints of a coronal loop drives plasma evaporation and eventually triggers condensation. The occurrence of condensation is strongly influenced by the characteristics of the heating. Various theoretical studies have been conducted along one-dimensional field lines with quasi-steady localized heating. The quasi-steady heating is regarded as the collection of multiple heating events among multiple strands constituting a coronal loop. However, it is reasonable to consider a single heating event along a single field line as an elemental unit. We investigated the condensation phenomenon triggered by a single heating event using 1.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations. By varying the magnitude of the localized heating rate, we explored the conditions necessary for condensation. We found that, when a heating rate approximately ~104 times greater than that of steady heating was applied, condensation occurred. Condensation was observed when the thermal conduction efficiency in the loop became lower than the cooling efficiency, with the cooling rate significantly exceeding the heating rate. Using the loop length L and the Field length λF, the condition for condensation is expressed as λF ≲ L/2 under conditions where cooling exceeds heating. We extended the analytically derived condition for thermal nonequilibrium to a formulation based on heating amount.

<title>The Globular Cluster System of the Virgo Cluster Ultradiffuse Galaxy VCC 615</title>

We use Hubble Space Telescope imaging to study the globular cluster system of the Virgo Cluster ultradiffuse galaxy (UDG) VCC 615. We select globular cluster candidates through a combination of size and color, while simultaneously rejecting contamination from background galaxies that would be unresolved in ground-based imaging. Our sample of globular cluster candidates is essentially complete down to a limiting magnitude of F814W = 24.0, ≈90% down the globular cluster luminosity function (GCLF). We estimate a total globular cluster population for VCC 615 of , resulting in a specific frequency of , quite high compared to normal galaxies of similar luminosity, but consistent with the large specific frequencies found in some other UDGs. The abundant cluster population suggests the galaxy is enshrouded by a massive dark halo, consistent with previous dynamical mass estimates using globular cluster kinematics. While the peak of the GCLF appears slightly brighter than expected (by ≈0.3–0.5 mag), this difference is comparable to the 0.3 mag uncertainty in the measurement, and we see no sign of an extremely luminous population of clusters similar to those detected in the UDGs NGC1054-DF2 and -DF4. However, we do find a relatively high fraction ( %) of large clusters with half-light radii Rh > 9 pc. The galaxy's offset nucleus appears photometrically distinct from the globular clusters, and is more akin to ultracompact dwarfs (UCDs) in Virgo. Over time, VCC615’s already diffuse stellar body may be further stripped by cluster tides, leaving the nucleus intact to form a new Virgo UCD.

<title>UNCOVER: Candidate Red Active Galactic Nuclei at 3 < z < 7 with JWST and ALMA</title>

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revolutionizing our knowledge of z > 5 galaxies and their actively accreting black holes. Using the JWST Cycle 1 Treasury program Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam Observations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) in the lensing field A2744, we report the identification of a sample of little red dots at 3 < zphot < 7 that likely contain highly reddened accreting supermassive black holes. Using a NIRCam-only selection to F444W < 27.7 mag, we find 26 sources over the ∼45 arcmin2 field that are blue in F115W − F200W ∼ 0 (or βUV ∼ –2.0 for fλ ∝ λβ), red in F200W − F444W = 1−4 (βopt ∼ +2.0), and are dominated by a point-source-like central component. Of the 20 sources with deep Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.2 mm coverage, none are detected individually or in a stack. For the majority of the sample, spectral energy distribution fits to the JWST+ALMA observations prefer models with hot dust rather than obscured star formation to reproduce the red NIRCam colors and ALMA 1.2 mm nondetections. While compact dusty star formation cannot be ruled out, the combination of extremely small sizes (〈re〉 ≈ 50 pc after correction for magnification), red rest-frame optical slopes, and hot dust can be explained by reddened broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our targets have faint M1450 ≈ −14 to −18 mag but inferred bolometric luminosities of Lbol = 1043–1046 erg s−1, reflecting their obscured nature. If the candidates are confirmed as AGNs with upcoming UNCOVER spectroscopy, then we have found an abundant population of reddened luminous AGNs that are at least ten times more numerous than UV-luminous AGNs at the same intrinsic bolometric luminosity.

<title>Stellar Metallicities from DECam u-band Photometry: A Study of Milky Way Ultra-faint Dwarf Galaxies</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9820</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9820</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We conducted an in-depth analysis of candidate member stars located in the peripheries of three ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxy satellites of the Milky Way (MW): Boötes I (Boo1), Boötes II (Boo2), and Segue I (Seg1). Studying these peripheral stars has previously been difficult due to contamination from the MW foreground. We used u-band photometry from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) to derive metallicities to efficiently select UFD candidate member stars. This approach was validated on Boo1, where we identified both previously known and new candidate member stars beyond five half-light radii. We then applied a similar procedure to Boo2 and Seg1. Our findings hinted at evidence for tidal features in Boo1 and Seg1, with Boo1 having an elongation consistent with its proper motion and Seg1 showing some distant candidate stars, a few of which are along its elongation and proper motion. We find two Boo2 stars at large distances consistent with being candidate member stars. Using a foreground contamination rate derived from the Besançon Galaxy model, we ascribed purity estimates to each candidate member star. We recommend further spectroscopic studies on the newly identified high-purity members. Our technique offers promise for future endeavors to detect candidate member stars at large radii in other systems, leveraging metallicity-sensitive filters with the Legacy Survey of Space and Time and the new, narrowband Ca HK filter on DECam.

<title>Star−Disk Collisions: Implications for Quasi-periodic Eruptions and Other Transients near Supermassive Black Holes</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8911</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8911</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We use Athena++ to study the hydrodynamics of repeated star−accretion disk collisions close to supermassive black holes, and we discuss their implications for the origin of quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) and other repeating nuclear transients. We quantify the impact of the collisions on the stellar structure, the amount of stripped stellar debris, and the orbital properties of the debris. We provide simple fitting functions for the stellar mass loss per collision; the mass loss is much larger after repeated collisions, due to the dilute stellar atmosphere shock-heated in earlier collisions. The lifetime of the QPE-emitting phase set by stellar mass loss in star−disk collision models for QPEs is thus at most ∼1000 yr; it is shortest for eRO-QPE2, of order a few decades. The mass of the stripped stellar debris per collision and its orbital properties imply that currently observed QPEs are not powered by direct star−disk collisions but rather by collisions between the stellar debris liberated in previous collisions and the accretion disk (“circularization shocks”). We discuss how the hydrodynamics of this interaction can explain the diverse timing properties of QPEs, including the regular timing of GSN 069 and eRO-QPE2 and the large flare-to-flare timing variations observed in eRO-QPE1. QPEs with recurrence times of many days, if observed, may have more regular timing.

<title>The FENIKS Survey: Spectroscopic Confirmation of Massive Quiescent Galaxies at z ∼ 3–5</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b30</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b30</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The measured ages of massive, quiescent galaxies at z ∼ 3–4 imply that massive galaxies quench as early as z ∼ 6. While the number of spectroscopic confirmations of quiescent galaxies at z < 3 has increased over the years, there are only a handful at z > 3.5. We report spectroscopic redshifts of one secure (z = 3.757) and two tentative (z = 3.336 and z = 4.673) massive ( ) quiescent galaxies with 11 hr of Keck/MOSFIRE K-band observations. Our candidates were selected from the FLAMINGOS-2 Extragalactic Near-Infrared K-band Split (FENIKS) survey, which uses deep Gemini/Flamingos-2 KbKr imaging optimized for increased sensitivity to the characteristic red colors of galaxies at z > 3 with a strong Balmer/4000 Å break. The rest-frame UVJ and (ugi)s colors of three out of four quiescent candidates are consistent with 1–2 Gyr old stellar populations. This places these galaxies as the oldest objects at these redshifts, and challenges the notion that quiescent galaxies at z > 3 are all recently quenched, post-starburst galaxies. Our spectroscopy shows that the other quiescent-galaxy candidate is a broad-line active galactic nucleus (z = 3.594) with strong, redshifted Hβ + [O III] emission with a velocity offset > 1000 km s−1, indicative of a powerful outflow. The star formation history of our highest redshift candidate suggests that its progenitor was already in place by z ∼ 7–11, reaching ∼1011 M⊙ by z ≃ 8. These observations reveal the limit of what is possible with deep near-infrared photometry and targeted spectroscopy from the ground and demonstrate that secure spectroscopic confirmation of quiescent galaxies at z > 4 is feasible only with JWST.

<title>EPOCHS. IV. SED Modeling Assumptions and Their Impact on the Stellar Mass Function at 6.5 ≤ z ≤ 13.5 Using PEARLS and Public JWST Observations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8c29</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8c29</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We utilize deep JWST Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) observations for the first direct constraints on the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function (GSMF) at z > 10. Our EPOCHS v1 sample includes 1120 galaxy candidates at 6.5 < z < 13.5 taken from a consistent reduction and analysis of publicly available deep JWST NIRCam data covering the Prime Extragalactic Areas for Reionization Science, CEERS, GLASS, JADES GOOD-S, NGDEEP, and SMACS0723 surveys, totaling 187 arcmin2. We investigate the impact of spectral energy distribution fitting methods, assumed star formation histories (SFHs), dust laws, and priors on galaxy masses and the resultant GSMF. While our fiducial GSMF agrees with the literature at z < 13.5, we find that the assumed SFH model has a large impact on the GSMF and stellar mass density (SMD), finding a 0.75 dex increase in the SMD at z = 10.5 between a flexible nonparametric and standard parametric SFH. Overall, we find a flatter SMD evolution at z ≥ 9 than some studies predict, suggesting a rapid buildup of stellar mass in the early Universe. We find no incompatibility between our results and those of standard cosmological models, as suggested previously, although the most massive galaxies may require a high star formation efficiency. We find that the “little red dot” galaxies dominate the z = 7 GSMF at high masses, necessitating a better understanding of the relative contributions of active galactic nucleus and stellar emission. We show that assuming a theoretically motivated top-heavy initial mass function (IMF) reduces stellar mass by 0.5 dex without affecting fit quality, but our results remain consistent with existing cosmological models with a standard IMF.

<title>Sub-Alfvénic Turbulence: Magnetic-to-kinetic Energy Ratio, Modification of Weak Cascade, and Implications for Magnetic Field Strength Measurements</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8d49</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8d49</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the properties of sub-Alfvénic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, i.e., turbulence with Alfvén mach number MA = VL/VA < 1, where VL is the velocity at the injection scale and VA is the Alfvén velocity. We demonstrate that MHD turbulence can have different properties, depending on whether it is driven by velocity or magnetic fluctuations. If the turbulence is driven by isotropic bulk forces acting upon the fluid, i.e., is velocity driven, in an incompressible conducting fluid we predict that the kinetic energy is times larger than the energy of magnetic fluctuations. This effect arises from the long parallel wavelength tail of the forcing, which excites modes with k∥/k⊥ < MA. We also predict that as the MHD turbulent cascade reaches the strong regime, the energy of slow modes exceeds the energy of Alfvén modes by a factor . These effects are absent if the turbulence is driven through magnetic fluctuations at the injection scale. We confirm our predictions with numerical simulations. Since the assumption of magnetic and kinetic energy equipartition is at the core of the Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi (DCF) approach to measuring magnetic field strength in sub-Alfvénic turbulence, we conclude that the DCF technique is not universally applicable. In particular, we suggest that the dynamical excitation of long azimuthal wavelength modes in the galactic disk may compromise the use of the DCF technique. We discuss alternative expressions that can be used to obtain magnetic field strength from observations and consider ways of distinguishing the cases of velocity and magnetically driven turbulence using observational data.

<title>Open Cluster Dynamics under the Influence of Outflow–Ambient Interactions</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad91a9</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Stars with outflows impinging on ambient gas experience accelerations due to the gravitational feedback from the interaction morphology between the outflow and the ambient gas. Such “negative dynamical friction” (NDF), in contrast to the conventional “dynamical friction” (DF), is studied for its impact on the dynamics of open clusters (OCs) immersed in a uniform ambient gas. We modify the N-body integration code REBOUND with both NDF and DF implemented according to the outflow conditions of each star in a consistently constructed OC. The evolution of stars is also involved in determining the gas–star interactions throughout their stellar lives. Compared to DF-only and gas-free models with identical initial conditions, the NDF-affected cluster is puffier and evaporates faster, as indicated by various diagnostics, including lower velocity dispersions and larger half-mass and half-light radii. Neutron stars with fast winds are expelled from the cluster due to their intensive NDF effect, even without the “kicks” by asymmetric supernovae. Exploration of parameter space confirms that the NDF effect is generally enhanced with higher ambient gas densities, in qualitative agreement with the expression of acceleration. Outflow–ambient interactions should be considered for the proper interpretation of the stellar dynamics evolution in clusters.

<title>A Systematic Search for Candidate Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Using Periodic Mid-infrared Light Curves of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9245</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Periodic variability in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is a promising method for studying subparsec supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), which are a challenging detection target. While extensive searches have been made in the optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray bands, systematic infrared (IR) studies remain limited. Using data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), which provides unique decade-long mid-IR light curves with a six-month cadence, we have conducted the first systematic search for SMBHB candidates based on IR periodicity. Analyzing a parent sample of 48,932 objects selected from about half a million AGNs, we have identified 28 candidate periodic AGNs with periods ranging from 1268 to 2437 days (in the observer frame), by fitting their WISE light curves with sinusoidal functions. However, our mock simulation of the parent sample indicates that stochastic variability can actually produce a similar number of periodic sources, underscoring the difficulty in robustly identifying real periodic signals with WISE light curves, given their current sampling. Notably, we find no overlap between our sample and optical periodic sources, which can be explained by a distinct preference for certain periods due to selection bias. By combining archived data from different surveys, we have identified a candidate exhibiting periodic behavior in both the optical and IR bands, a phenomenon that warrants further validation through observational tests. Our results highlight the potential of IR time-domain surveys, including future missions such as the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, for identifying periodic AGNs, but complementary tests are still needed to determine their physical origins, such as SMBHBs.

<title>The Mega-MUSCLES Treasury Survey: X-Ray to Infrared Spectral Energy Distributions of a Representative Sample of M Dwarfs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present 5–1 × 107 Å spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for 12 M dwarf stars covering spectral types M0–M8. Our SEDs are provided for community use as a sequel to the Measurements of the Ultraviolet Spectral Characteristics of Low-mass Exoplanetary Systems (MUSCLES) survey. The 12 stars include eight known exoplanet hosts and four stars chosen to fill out key parameter space in spectral type and rotation period. The SEDs are constructed from Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet spectroscopy and XMM Newton, Chandra, and/or Swift X-ray observations, and completed with various model data, including Lyα reconstructions, PHOENIX optical models, APEC coronal models, and differential emission measure models in the currently-unobservable extreme ultraviolet. We provide a complete overview of the Mega-MUSCLES program, including a description of the observations, models, and SED construction. The SEDs are available as MAST high-level science products and we describe the various data products here. We also present ensemble measurements from our sample that are of particular relevance to exoplanet science, including the high-energy fluxes in the habitable zone and the far-ultraviolet to near-ultraviolet ratio. Combined with MUSCLES, Mega-MUSCLES provides SEDs covering a wide range of M dwarf spectral types and ages such that suitable proxies for any M dwarf planet host of interest may be found in our sample. However, we find that ultraviolet and X-ray fluxes can vary even between stars with similar parameters, such that observations of each exoplanet host star will remain the gold standard for interpreting exoplanet atmosphere observations.

<title>Young Stellar Object Jets Magnetocentrifugally Driven by Reconnecting Atmospheric Avalanche Accretion Streams above Inner Circumstellar Disks</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad927b</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Fast, collimated jets are ubiquitous features of young stellar objects. They are generally thought to be powered by disk accretion, but the details are debated. Through 2D (axisymmetric) MHD simulations, we find that a fast (>100 km s−1) collimated bipolar jet is continuously driven along the north and south poles of a circumstellar disk that is initially magnetized by a large-scale open poloidal field and contains a thermally ionized inner magnetically active zone surrounded by a dead zone. The fast jet is primarily driven magnetocentrifugally by the release of the gravitational binding energy of the so-called “avalanche accretion streams” near the boundary of an evacuated poloidal field dominated polar region and a thick disk atmosphere raised by a toroidal magnetic field. Specifically, the fast outflow is driven along the upper (open) branch of the highly pinched poloidal field lines threading the (strongly magnetically braked) accretion streams, where the density is relatively low so that the lightly loaded material can be accelerated magnetocentrifugally along the open field line to a high speed. The highly pinched poloidal magnetic fields threading the avalanche accretion streams tend to reconnect, enabling mass to accrete to the center without dragging along the poloidal magnetic flux with it. The reconnection provides a potential heating source for producing chondrules and calcium- and aluminum-rich inclusions.

<title>Mapping the Dense Molecular Gas toward 13 Supernova Remnants</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Supernova remnants (SNRs) can exert strong influence on molecular clouds (MCs) through interaction by shock wave and cosmic rays. In this paper, we present our mapping observation of HCO+ and 1–0 lines toward 13 SNRs interacting with MCs, together with archival data of CO isotopes. Strong HCO+ emission is found in the fields of view of SNRs W30, G9.7−0.0, Kes 69, 3C 391, 3C 396, W51C, HC 40, and CTB109 in the local-standard-of-rest velocity intervals in which they are suggested to show evidence of SNR–MC interaction. We find an incomplete 12CO shell surrounding G9.7−0.0 with an expanding motion. This shell may be driven by the stellar wind of the SNR progenitor. We also find an arc of 12CO gas spatially coincident with the northwestern radio shell of Kes 69. As for the HCO+ line emission, SNRs 3C 391 and W51C exhibit significant line profile broadening indicative of shock perturbation, and CTB109 exhibits a possible blueshifted line wing brought by shock interaction. We do not find significant variation of the line ratio between broad-line and narrow-line regions, among different SNRs, and between MCs associated with SNRs and typical Galactic MCs. Therefore, we caution on using the line ratio as a diagnostic of SNR feedback and cosmic-ray (CR) ionization. We also estimate the N(HCO+)/N(CO) abundance ratio in 11 regions toward the observed SNRs, but they show little difference from the typical values in quiescent MCs, possibly because N(HCO+)/N(CO) is not an effective tracer of CR ionization.

<title>Radiatively Active Clouds and Magnetic Effects Explored in a Grid of Hot Jupiter GCMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Cloud formation and magnetic effects are both expected to significantly impact the structures and observable properties of hot Jupiter atmospheres. For some hot Jupiters, thermal ionization and condensation can coexist in a single atmosphere, and both processes are important. We present a grid of general circulation models across a wide range of irradiation temperatures with and without incorporating the effects of magnetism and cloud formation to investigate how these processes work in tandem. We find that clouds are present in the atmosphere at all modeled irradiation temperatures, while magnetic effects are negligible for planets with irradiation temperatures cooler than 2000 K. At and above this threshold, clouds and magnetic fields shape atmospheres together, with mutual feedback. Models that include magnetism, through their influence on the temperature structure, produce more longitudinally symmetric dayside cloud coverage and more equatorially concentrated clouds on the nightside and morning terminator. To indicate how these processes would affect observables, we generate bolometric thermal and reflected phase curves from these models. The combination of clouds and magnetic effects increases thermal phase-curve amplitudes and decreases peak offsets more than either process does individually.

<title>Rising Near-ultraviolet Spectra in Stellar Megaflares</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9395</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Flares from M dwarf stars can attain energies up to 104 times larger than solar flares but are generally thought to result from similar processes of magnetic energy release and particle acceleration. Larger heating rates in the low atmosphere are needed to reproduce the shape and strength of the observed continua in stellar flares, which are often simplified to a blackbody model from the optical to the far-ultraviolet (FUV). The near-ultraviolet (NUV) has been woefully undersampled in spectral observations despite this being where the blackbody radiation should peak. We present Hubble Space Telescope NUV spectra in the impulsive phase of a flare with ETESS ≈ 7.5 × 1033 erg and a flare with ETESS ≈ 1035 erg and the largest NUV flare luminosity observed to date from an M star. The composite NUV spectra are not well represented by a single blackbody that is commonly assumed in the literature. Rather, continuum flux rises toward shorter wavelengths into the FUV, and we calculate that an optical T = 104 K blackbody underestimates the short-wavelength NUV flux by a factor of ≈6. We show that rising NUV continuum spectra can be reproduced by collisionally heating the lower atmosphere with beams of E ≳ 10 MeV protons or E ≳ 500 keV electrons and flux densities of 1013 erg cm−2 s−1. These are much larger than the canonical values describing accelerated particles in solar flares.

<title>Pulse-profile Modeling and Spin–Orbit Alignment in a Suzaku Sample of Accreting X-Ray Binary Pulsars</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report pulse-profile modeling of a sample of 23 X-ray binary pulsars observed with the Suzaku X-ray satellite. These pulsars have spin periods ranging from 0.7 to 9400 s, and their X-ray emission is powered by the accretion from their stellar companions. We fitted each individual pulse profile with the Polestar geometric model, which accounts for X-ray emission from two hot spots modeled as a simple combination of fan+pencil beam components, including an approximation for gravitational light bending. In 14 of 21 cases, our measurements of the inclinations of the pulsar spin axes broadly agree with the corresponding inclinations of the orbital planes of the binary systems determined by various other means, a striking outcome with a mere 6 × 10−7 probability of occurring by chance. The implications of our study are as follows: (a) apparently, accretion torques have had time to erase spin–orbit misalignment caused by supernova kicks in two-thirds of the systems; (b) many X-ray binary pulsars have dominant dipolar surface magnetic fields, in contrast to the recently reported exotic configurations in millisecond pulsars; and (c) if the binary inclinations can be determined by pulse-profile modeling, even for a subset of the ∼200 known X-ray binary pulsars, most of which orbital inclinations are as yet poorly constrained, it raises the prospect of tightening dramatically ongoing neutron-star mass determinations. This is because masses in binary systems overwhelmingly come from an orbital-mechanics formulation (Kepler’s third law), in which the dominant source of uncertainty is the inclination of the orbital plane.

<title>LMC Calls, Milky Way Halo Answers: Disentangling the Effects of the MW–LMC Interaction on Stellar Stream Populations</title>

The infall of the LMC into the Milky Way (MW) has dynamical implications throughout the MW’s dark matter halo. We study the impact of this merger on the statistical properties of populations of simulated stellar streams. Specifically, we investigate the radial and on-sky angular dependence of stream perturbations caused by the direct effect of stream–LMC interactions and/or the response of the MW dark matter halo. We use a time-evolving MW–LMC simulation described by basis function expansions to simulate streams. We quantify the degree of perturbation using a set of stream property statistics including the misalignment of proper motions with the stream track. In the outer halo, direct stream–LMC interactions produce a statistically significant effect, boosting the fraction of misaligned proper motions by ∼25% relative to the model with no LMC. Moreover, there is on-sky angular dependence of stream perturbations: the highest fractions of perturbed streams coincide with the same on-sky quadrant as the present-day LMC location. In the inner halo, the MW halo dipole response primarily drives stream perturbations, but it remains uncertain whether this is a detectable signature distinct from the LMC’s influence. For the fiducial MW–LMC model, we find agreement between the predicted fraction of streams with significantly misaligned proper motions, , and Dark Energy Survey data. Finally, we predict this fraction for the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) footprint. Using LSST data will improve our constraints on dark matter models and LMC properties, as it is sensitive to both.

<title>Modeling the Center-to-limb Systematic in Normal-mode Coupling Measurements</title>

Solar meridional circulation (MC), which manifests as poleward flow near the surface, is a relatively weak flow. While MC has been measured through various local helioseismic techniques, there is a lack of consensus about the nature of the depth profile and location of return flow, owing to its small amplitude and poor signal-to-noise ratio in observations. The measurements are strongly hampered by systematic effects whose amplitudes are comparable to the signal induced by the flow, and modeling them is therefore crucial. The removal of the center-to-limb (C2L) systematic, which is the largest known feature hampering the inference of meridional flow, has been heuristically performed in helioseismic analyses, but its effect on global modes is not fully understood or modeled. Here, we propose both a way to model the C2L systematic and a method for estimation of meridional flow using global helioseismic cross-spectral analysis. We demonstrate that the systematic cannot be ignored while modeling the mode-coupling cross-spectral measurement, and thus is critical for the inference of MC. We also show that inclusion of a model for the C2L systematic improves shallow MC estimates from cross-spectral analysis.

<title>Multiwavelength Constraints on the Local Black Hole Occupation Fraction</title>

The fraction of dwarf galaxies hosting central, intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) at low redshifts is an important observational probe of black hole seeding at high redshift. Detections of nuclear accretion signatures in dwarf galaxies provides strong evidence for the presence of these IMBHs. We develop a Bayesian model to infer the black hole occupation fraction assuming a broken power-law Eddington ratio distribution function. Our approach accounts for nondetections, incompleteness, and contamination from star-forming-related emission. We apply this model to galaxies with X-ray data from the Chandra Source Catalog at distances <50 Mpc, radio data from the Very Large Array Sky Survey at <50 Mpc, and optical variability data from the Palomar Transient Factory at z < 0.055. We find a black hole occupation fraction of at least 90% at stellar masses of M⋆ = 108M⊙ and at least 39% at M⋆ = 107M⊙ (95% confidence intervals). We show the resulting black hole mass function. These constraints on the IMBH population have implications for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna mission and for cosmological models of black hole seeding and growth. We also constrain the extremely low-luminosity end (Lbol ≲ 1040 erg s−1) of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) luminosity functions at z = 0. Our AGN luminosity functions are broadly consistent with an extrapolation of the shallow slope of the AGN luminosity functions from previous work.

<title>Microlensing Events in Five Years of Photometry from the Zwicky Transient Facility</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad94e7</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad94e7</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Microlensing has a unique advantage for detecting dark objects in the Milky Way, such as free-floating planets, neutron stars, and stellar-mass black holes. Most microlensing surveys focus on the Galactic bulge, where higher stellar density leads to a higher event rate. However, microlensing events in the Galactic plane have closer lenses and longer timescales, which leads to a greater chance of measuring microlens parallax, providing an additional constraint on the mass of the lens. This work searches for microlensing events in Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Data Release 17 from 2018 to 2023 in the Galactic plane region. We find 124 high-confidence microlensing events and 54 possible events, all available online (see footnote 11). Thus, with 2 yr of additional ZTF data in DR17, we have more than doubled the number of microlensing events (60) found in the previous 3 yr DR5 search. In the event selection, we use the efficient EventFinder algorithm to detect microlensing signals, which could be used for large data sets such as future ZTF data releases or data from the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time. Using detection efficiencies of ZTF fields obtained from catalog-level simulations, we calculate the mean Einstein timescale to be 〈tE〉 = 51.7 ± 3.3 days, smaller than previous results of the Galactic plane but within 1.5σ. We also calculate optical depths and event rates, although some caution is needed due to the use of visual inspection when creating our final sample. Spectroscopy of three possible candidates confirms their microlensing nature.

<title>A Spectro-temporal View of Normal Branch Oscillations in Cygnus X-2 as Seen by NICER and NuSTAR</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9588</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the spectro-temporal study of the neutron star low mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-2 using NICER and NuSTAR data while the source was in the normal branch (NB). We detect a normal branch oscillation (NBO) feature at ∼5.41 Hz that appears in the middle portion of the NB branch. We note that the NBO appeared only in the 0.5–3 keV energy range, with maximum strength in the 1–2 keV energy band, but was absent in the 3–10 keV energy band of NuSTAR and NICER data. The energy spectrum of the source exhibits an emission feature at ∼1 keV, previously identified as the Fe L transition in the outer region of the accretion disk. Upon considering both the Fe L and NBO features, we suggest that the originating location of the Fe L line and the NBOs may coincide and perhaps be due to the same underlying mechanism. Therefore, lags seen in the frequency-/energy-dependent lag spectra of Cygnus X-2 could be considered to be arising from a region of photoionized material far from the central source. We study the frequency and energy-dependent lag spectra of the source, which exhibited a few millisecond hard lag at the NBO frequency (12–15 ms) and a switch from hard to soft lags at 1 keV. The rms spectrum peaks at 1 keV, and the covariance spectrum clearly resembles a thermal spectrum. We discuss the spectro-temporal behavior of the NBO and attempt to constrain its location of origin.

<title>The Relation between AGN and Host-galaxy Properties in the JWST Era. I. Seyferts at Cosmic Noon are Obscured and Disturbed</title>

The morphology of a galaxy reflects the mix of physical processes occurring within and around it, offering indirect clues to its formation and evolution. We apply both visual classification and computer vision to test the suspected connection between galaxy mergers and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, as evidenced by a close/merging galaxy pair, or tidal features surrounding an apparently singular system. We use JADES JWST/NIRCam imagery of a complete, multiwavelength AGN sample recently expanded with JWST/Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) photometry. This 0.9–25 μm data set enables constraints on the host-galaxy morphologies of a broad range of AGN beyond z ∼ 1, including heavily obscured examples missing from previous studies. Our primary AGN sample consists of 243 lightly to highly obscured X-ray-selected AGN and 138 presumed Compton-thick, mid-infrared-bright/X-ray-faint AGN revealed by MIRI. Utilizing the shape asymmetry morphology indicator, AS, as the metric for disturbance, we find that 88% of the Seyferts sampled are strongly spatially disturbed (AS > 0.2). The experimental design we employ reveals a ≳3σ obscuration–merger (NH–AS) correlation at 0.6 < z < 2.4, and also recovers a physical distinction between the X-ray- and mid-IR-detected AGN suggestive of their link to a common evolutionary scenario. Placing the observed pattern of disturbances in the context of the other average host-galaxy properties, we conclude that mergers are common among obscured AGN. This finding presents tension with the leading model on AGN fueling that requires Seyfert AGN with subquasar luminosities (Lbol < 1045 erg s−1) to evolve only through nonmerger mechanisms.

<title>Magnetic Field Geometry and Anisotropic Scattering Effects on Solar Radio Burst Observations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The fine structures of solar radio bursts reveal complex dynamics in the corona, yet the observed characteristics of these subsecond bursts are additionally complicated by radio wave scattering in the turbulent solar corona. We examine the impact of anisotropic turbulence in radio wave propagation simulations with nonradial magnetic field structures in shaping the morphology, time characteristics, and source positions of fine structures. The apparent sources are found to move along the direction of the magnetic field lines and not along the density gradient, whereas the major axis of the scattered source is perpendicular to the local magnetic field (the scattering anisotropy axis). Using a dipolar magnetic field structure of an active region, we reproduce observed radio fine-structure source motion parallel to the solar limb associated with a coronal loop and provide a natural explanation for puzzling observations of solar radio burst position motions with the Low Frequency Array. Furthermore, the anisotropy aligned with a dipolar magnetic field causes the apparent-source images to bifurcate into two distinct components, with characteristic sizes smaller than in unmagnetized media. The temporal broadening induced by scattering reduces the observed frequency drift rate of fine structures, depending on the contribution of scattering to the time profile. The findings underscore the role of magnetic field geometry and anisotropic scattering for the interpretation of solar radio bursts and highlight that anisotropic scattering produces more than a single source.

<title>Frozen-field Modeling of Coronal Condensations with MPI-AMRVAC. II. Optimization and Application in 3D Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The frozen-field hydrodynamic (ffHD) model is a simplification of the full magnetohydrodynamical equations under the assumption of a rigid magnetic field, which significantly reduces computational complexity and enhances efficiency. In this work, we combine the ffHD prescription with hyperbolic thermal conduction (TC) and the Transition Region Adaptive Conduction (TRAC) method to achieve further optimization. A series of 2D tests are done to evaluate the performance of the hyperbolic TC and the TRAC method. The results indicate that hyperbolic TC, while showing limiter-affected numerical dissipation, delivers outcomes comparable to classic parabolic TC. The TRAC method effectively compensates for the underestimation of enthalpy flux in low-resolution simulations, as evaluated on tests that demonstrate prominence formation. We present an application of the ffHD model that forms a 3D prominence embedded in a magnetic flux rope, which develops into a stable slab-like filament. The simulation reveals a prominence with an elongated spine and a width consistent with observations, highlighting the potential of the ffHD model in capturing the dynamics of solar prominences. Forward modeling of the simulation data produces synthetic images at various wavelengths, providing insights into the appearance of prominences and filaments in different observational contexts. The ffHD model, with its computational efficiency and the demonstrated capability to simulate complex solar phenomena, offers a valuable tool for solar physicists, and is implemented in the open-source MPI-AMRVAC framework.

<title>Detecting Dark Objects with Plasma Microlensing by Their Gravitational Wakes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A moving mass makes a gravitational wake in the partially ionized interstellar medium, which acts as a lens for radio-frequency light. Consequently, plasma microlensing could complement gravitational microlensing in the search for invisible massive objects, such as stellar remnants or compact dark matter. This work explores the spatial structure of the plasma lens associated with a gravitational wake. Far away from the moving mass, the characteristic lensing signal is the steady demagnification or magnification of a radio source as the wake passes in front of it at the speed of sound. Sources can be plasma-lensed at a much greater angular distance than they could be gravitationally lensed to the same degree by the same object. However, only the wakes of objects greatly exceeding stellar mass are expected to dominate over the random turbulence in the interstellar medium.

<title>NGC 628 in SIGNALS: Explaining the Abundance-ionization Correlation in H ii Regions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The variations of oxygen abundance and ionization parameter in H ii regions are usually thought to be the dominant factors that produced variations seen in observed emission-line spectra. However, if and how these two quantities are physically related is hotly debated in the literature. Using emission line data of NGC 628 observed with SITELLE as part of the Star formation, Ionized Gas, and Nebular Abundances Legacy Survey (SIGNALS), we use a suite of photoionization models to constrain the abundance and ionization parameters for over 1500 H ii regions throughout its disk. We measure an anticorrelation between these two properties, consistent with expectations, although with considerable scatter. Secondary trends with dust extinction and star formation rate surface density potentially explain the large scatter observed. We raise concerns throughout regarding various modeling assumptions and their impact on the observed correlations presented in the literature.

<title>Hierarchical Searches for Subsolar-mass Binaries and the Third-generation Gravitational Wave Detector Era</title>

Detecting gravitational waves (GWs) from coalescing compact binaries has become routine with ground-based detectors like Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. However, beyond standard sources such as binary black holes and neutron stars and neutron star black holes, no exotic sources revealing new physics have been discovered. Detecting ultracompact objects, such as subsolar mass (SSM), offers a promising opportunity to explore diverse astrophysical populations. However, searching for these objects using standard matched-filtering techniques is computationally intensive due to the dense parameter space involved. This increasing computational demand not only challenges current search methodologies but also poses a significant obstacle for third-generation (3G) ground-based GW detectors. In the 3G detectors, signals are expected to be observed for tens of minutes and detection rates to reach one per minute. This requires efficient search strategies to manage the computational load of long-duration signal search. In this paper, we demonstrate how hierarchical search strategies can address the computational challenges associated with detecting long-duration signals in current detectors and the 3G era. Using SSM searches as an example, we show that optimizing data sampling rates and adjusting the number of templates in matched filtering at each stage of low-frequency searches can improve the signal-to-noise ratio by 6% and detection volume by 10%–20%. This sensitivity improvement is achieved with a 2.5-fold reduction in computational time compared to standard PyCBC searches. We also discuss how this approach could be adapted and refined for searches involving eccentric and precessing binaries with future detectors.

<title>Magnetic Flux Transport in Advection-dominated Accretion Flow toward the Formation of a Magnetically Arrested Disk</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Magnetically arrested disks (MADs) have attracted much attention in recent years. The formation of MADs is usually attributed to the accumulation of a sufficient amount of dynamically significant poloidal magnetic flux. In this work, the magnetic flux transport within an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) and the formation of an MAD are investigated. The structure and dynamics of an inner MAD connected with an outer ADAF are derived by solving a set of differential equations with suitable boundary conditions. We find that an inner MAD is eventually formed at a region about several 10 RS outside the horizon. Due to the presence of a strong large-scale magnetic field, the radial velocity of the accretion flow is significantly decreased. The angular velocity of the MAD region is highly sub-Keplerian with Ω ∼ (0.4–0.5)ΩK, and the corresponding ratio of gas to magnetic pressure is about β ≲ 1. Also, we find that an MAD is unlikely to be formed through the inward flux advection process when the external magnetic field strength is weak enough with βout ≳ 100 around Rout ∼ 1000 Rs. Based on a rough estimate, we find that the jet power of a black hole, with mass MBH and spin a*, surrounded by an ADAF with an inner MAD region is about 2 orders of magnitude larger than that of a black hole surrounded by a normal ADAF. This may account for the powerful jets observed in some Fanaroff–Riley type I galaxies with a very low Eddington ratio.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present radial profiles of luminosity-weighted age (ageL) and ΔΣSFR for various populations of high- and low-mass central and satellite galaxies in the TNG100 cosmological simulation. Using these profiles, we investigate the impact of intrinsic and environmental factors on the radial distribution of star formation. For both central galaxies and satellites, we investigate the effects of black hole mass, cumulative active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback energy, morphology, halo mass, and local galaxy overdensity on the profiles. In addition, we investigate the dependence of radial profiles of the satellite galaxies as a function of the redshifts at which they joined their hosts, as well as the net change in star-forming gas mass since the satellites joined their host. We find that high-mass (M* > 1010.5M⊙) central and satellite galaxies show evidence of inside-out quenching driven by AGN feedback. Effects from environmental processes only become apparent in averaged profiles at extreme halo masses and local overdensities. We find that the dominant quenching process for low-mass galaxies (M* < 1010M⊙) is environmental, generally occurring at low halo mass and high local galaxy overdensity for low-mass central galaxies and at high host halo masses for low-mass satellite galaxies. Overall, we find that environmental processes generally drive quenching from the outside-in.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Coronal mass ejections (CME) are regarded as the main drivers of geomagnetic storms (GSs). In the prediction of geoeffectiveness, various CME features have been introduced without adequately considering the geoeffectiveness of CMEs and strong correlations among the features. In this study, a feature dimension reduction method combining distance correlation (DC) and principal component analysis (PCA) was employed for the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) model to predict the geoeffectiveness of halo CME by using the multiple CME features. First, based on CME features and the Disturbance Storm Time index, there are 169 CME-related GS (CME-GS) pairs that were defined as positive samples during the entire phases of solar cycles 23 and 24. Next, DC was used to screen the eight original CME features. It was found that the three CME features, such as acceleration, kinetic energy, and measurement position angle, were weakly correlated with CME-GS pairs according to the performance of KNN prediction models and then were discarded. In order to further reduce the dimension of the input features for the KNN prediction model, PCA was subsequently applied. And the above remaining five principal components were reduced to one. Finally, the DC-PCA-KNN prediction model, achieving a mean true positive rate of 0.6519 and an accuracy of 0.6494, performed well in the prediction of halo CME geoeffectiveness and was superior to the DC or PCA model alone.

<title>Constraining the Galactic Structure Using Time Domain Gravitational Wave Signal from Double White Dwarfs Detected by Space Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The gravitational wave (GW) signals from a large number of double white dwarfs (DWDs) in the Galaxy are expected to be detected by space GW detectors, e.g., the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), Taiji, and Tianqin in the millihertz band. In this paper, we present an alternative method by directly using the time-domain GW signal detected by space GW detectors to constrain the anisotropic structure of the Galaxy. The information of anisotropic distribution of DWDs is naturally encoded in the time-domain GW signal because of the variation of the detectors’ directions and consequently the pattern functions due to their annual motion around the Sun. The direct use of the time-domain GW signal enables simple calculations, such as utilizing an analytical method to assess the noise arising from the superposition of random phases of DWDs and using appropriate weights to improve the constraints. We investigate the possible constraints on the scale of the Galactic thin disk and bulge that may be obtained from LISA and Taiji by using this method with mock signals obtained from population synthesis models. We further show the different constraining capabilities of the low-frequency signal (foreground) and the high-frequency signal (resolvable sources) via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, and find that the scale height and length of the Galactic thin disk and the scale radius of the bulge can be constrained to a fractional accuracy of ∼30%, 30%, 40% (or 20%, 10%, 40%) by using the low-frequency (or high-frequency) signal detected by LISA or Taiji.

<title>New Insight of Time-transformed Symplectic Integrator. I. Hybrid Methods for Hierarchical Triples</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Accurate N-body simulations of multiple systems such as binaries and triples are essential for understanding the formation and evolution of interacting binaries and binary mergers, including gravitational wave sources, blue stragglers, and X-ray binaries. The logarithmic time-transformed explicit symplectic integrator (LogH), also known as algorithmic regularization, is a state-of-the-art method for this purpose. However, we show that this method is accurate for isolated Kepler orbits because of its ability to trace Keplerian trajectories, but much less accurate for hierarchical triple systems. The method can lead to an unphysical secular evolution of inner eccentricity in Kozal–Lidov triples, despite a small energy error. We demonstrate that hybrid methods, which apply LogH to the inner binary and alternative methods to the outer bodies, are significantly more effective, though not symplectic. Additionally, we introduce a more efficient hybrid method, BlogH, which eliminates the need for time synchronization and is time symmetric. The method is implemented in the few-body code SDAR. We explore suitable criteria for switching between the LogH and BlogH methods for general triple systems. These hybrid methods have the potential to enhance the integration performance of hierarchical triples.

A giant radio halo (RH) is a diffuse synchrotron emission observed on the scale of megaparsecs, typically found in the central region of merging galaxy clusters. Its large size and steep spectrum suggest that it originates from the reenergization of an aged population of cosmic-ray electrons (CREs), while the secondary leptons produced in the pp hadronic collision of cosmic-ray protons (CRPs) may contribute to the emission. In this study, we investigate the reacceleration model including both primary and secondary CREs, assuming that the primary cosmic rays (CRs) originate from internal galaxies. In our new method, we follow the cosmological evolution of each cluster and calculate the energy spectra and 1D spatial distributions of CRs. The primary CRE model with a ∼3 Gyr duration of reacceleration successfully reproduces the statistical properties of the RHs observed in the recent LOFAR survey, as well as the spectrum and profile of the Coma cluster. The gamma-ray and neutrino emissions produced by reaccelerated CRPs are consistent with the upper limits. However, if the CRP injection rate is high and the secondary CREs become significant, the model with the required ∼3 Gyr reacceleration overproduces the number of RHs. The limit on the CRP injection rate, Lp ≲ 1041 erg s−1, is significantly lower than that expected from the early starburst activity or jets from active galactic nuclei. This discrepancy requires a revision of either the model of CR supply from galaxies or the turbulent reacceleration model.

<title>Analysis of Gamma-Ray Burst Closure Relationship in Multiple Wavelengths</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are intense pulses of high-energy emission associated with the death of massive stars or compact objects’ coalescence. Their multiwavelength observations help verify the reliability of the standard fireball model. We analyze 14 GRBs observed contemporaneously in gamma rays by the Fermi Large Area Telescope, in X-rays by the Swift Telescope, and in the optical bands by Swift and many ground-based telescopes. We study the correlation between the spectral and temporal indices using closure relations according to the synchrotron forward-shock model in a stratified medium (n ∝ r−k) with k ranging from 0 to 2.5. We find that the model without energy injection is preferred over the one with energy injection in all the investigated wavelengths. In gamma rays, we only explored the ν > max{νc, νm} (slow cooling, SC/fast cooling, FC) cooling condition (where νc and νm are the cooling and characteristic frequencies, namely the frequencies at the spectral break). In the X-ray and optical bands, we explored all the cooling conditions, including νm < ν < νc (SC), νc < ν < νm (FC), and SC/FC, and found a clear preference for SC for X-rays and SC/FC for optical. Within these cooling conditions, X-rays exhibit the highest rate of occurrence for the density profile with k = 0, while the optical band has the highest occurrence for k = 2.5 when considering no energy injection. Although we can pinpoint a definite environment for some GRBs, we find degeneracies in other GRBs.

<title>Milky Way Dark Matter Distribution or MOND Test from Vertical Stellar Kinematics with Gaia DR3</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad94f5</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad94f5</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Vertical stellar kinematics+density can be used to trace the dark matter distribution (or the equivalent phantom mass in a Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) scenario) through the Jeans equations. In this paper, we want to improve this type of analysis by making use of the recent data of the 6D information from the Gaia DR3 survey in the anticenter and the Galactic poles to obtain the dynamical mass distribution near plane regions, including extended kinematics over a wide region of 8 kpc < R < 22 kpc, ∣z∣ < 3 kpc. Our conclusions are as follows: (i) the model of the spherical dark matter halos and the MOND model are compatible with the data; (ii) the model of the disky matter (with density proportional to the gas density) is excluded; (iii) the total lack of dark matter (there is only visible matter) within Newtonian gravity is compatible with the data; for instance, at solar Galactocentric radius, we obtained Σ = 39 ± 18 M⊙ pc−2 for z = 1.05 kpc, compatible with the expected value for visible matter alone of 44 M⊙ pc−2, thus allowing zero dark matter. Similarly, for R > R⊙, z = 1.05 kpc, Σ = 28.7 ± 9.6, 23.0 ± 5.7, 16.9 ± 5.8, and 11.4 ± 6.6 M⊙ pc−2, respectively, for R = 10, 13, 16, and 19 kpc, compatible with visible matter alone. Larger error bars in comparison with previous works are not due to worse data or a more awkward technique but to a stricter modeling of the stellar distribution.

<title>Bar Formation and Destruction in the FIRE-2 Simulations</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b45</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The physical mechanisms responsible for bar formation and destruction in galaxies remain a subject of debate. While we have gained valuable insight into how bars form and evolve from isolated idealized simulations, in the cosmological domain, galactic bars evolve in complex environments, with mergers and gas accretion events occurring in the presence of the turbulent interstellar medium with multiple star formation episodes, in addition to coupling with their host galaxies’ dark matter halos. We investigate the bar formation in 13 Milky Way–mass galaxies from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) cosmological zoom-in simulations. 8 of the 13 simulated galaxies form bars at some point during their history: three from tidal interactions and five from internal evolution of the disk. The bars in FIRE-2 are generally shorter than the corotation radius (mean bar radius ∼1.53 kpc), have a wide range of pattern speeds (36–97 km s−1 kpc−1), and live for a wide range of dynamical times (2–160 bar rotations). We find that the bar formation in FIRE-2 galaxies is influenced by satellite interactions and the stellar-to-dark-matter mass ratio in the inner galaxy, but neither is a sufficient condition for bar formation. Bar formation is more likely to occur, with the bars formed being stronger and longer-lived, if the disks are kinematically cold; galaxies with high central gas fractions and/or vigorous star formation, on the other hand, tend to form weaker bars. In the case of the FIRE-2 galaxies, these properties combine to produce ellipsoidal bars with strengths A2/A0 ∼ 0.1–0.2.

To address the discrepancy where disk sizes exceed those predicted by standard models, we explore two extensions to disk size estimates within the UV/optical wavelength range: disk winds and color correction. We provide detailed, self-consistent derivations and analytical formulas, including those based on a power-law temperature approximation, offering efficient tools for analyzing observational data. Applying our model to four type I active galactic nuclei with intensive reverberation mapping observations, we find a shallower temperature slope (T ∝ R−0.66, compared to R−3/4 traditionally) and a color-correction factor (fcol ≈ 1.6), consistent with previous studies. We observe a positive correlation between accretion rate and color correction with black hole mass. However, the small sample size limits our conclusions. The strong degeneracy between the temperature slope and accretion rate suggests that incorporating flux spectra or spectral energy distributions could improve fitting accuracy. Our simulation approach rapidly generates quasar light curves while accommodating various observational scenarios for reverberation mapping, making it well-suited for training machine learning algorithms.

<title>Analysis of Solar Eruptions Deflecting in the Low Corona: Influence of the Magnetic Environment</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) can exhibit nonradial evolution. The background magnetic field is considered the main driver for the trajectory deviation relative to the source region. The influence of the magnetic environment has been largely attributed to the gradient of the magnetic pressure. In this work, we propose a new approach for investigating the role of topology on CME deflection and for quantifying and comparing the action between the magnetic field gradient (“gradient” path) and the topology (“topological” path). We investigate eight events simultaneously observed by the Solar Orbiter, STEREO-A, and the Solar Dynamics Observatory; and, with a new tracking technique, we reconstruct the 3D evolution of the eruptions. Then, we compare their propagation with the predictions from the two magnetic drivers. We find that the “topological” path describes the CME actual trajectory much better than the more traditional “gradient path.” Our results strongly indicate that the ambient topology may be the dominant driver for deflections in the low corona, and that this presents a promising method for estimating the direction of propagation of CMEs early in their evolution.

<title>Self-interacting Dark Matter, Core Collapse, and the Galaxy–Galaxy Strong-lensing Discrepancy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters has emerged as a powerful tool to probe the standard cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm of structure formation in the Universe. Despite the remarkable explanatory power of CDM on large scales, tensions with observations on small scales have been reported. Recent studies find that the observational cross section for galaxy–galaxy strong lensing (GGSL) in clusters exceeds the CDM prediction by more than an order of magnitude and persists even after rigorous examination of various possible systematics. We investigate the impact of modifying the internal structure of cluster dark matter subhalos on GGSL and report that altering the inner density profile, given by rγ, to steeper slopes with γ > 2.5 can alleviate the GGSL discrepancy. This is steeper than slopes obtained with the inclusion of the contribution of baryons to the inner regions of these subhalos. Deviating from the γ ~ 1.0 cusps that CDM predicts, these steeper slopes could arise in models of self-interacting dark matter undergoing core collapse. Our results motivate additional study of subhalo core collapse in dense cluster environments.

<title>Diffusion-HMC: Parameter Inference with Diffusion-model-driven Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</title>

Diffusion generative models have excelled at diverse image generation and reconstruction tasks across fields. A less explored avenue is their application to discriminative tasks involving regression or classification problems. The cornerstone of modern cosmology is the ability to generate predictions for observed astrophysical fields from theory and constrain physical models from observations using these predictions. This work uses a single diffusion generative model to address these interlinked objectives—as a surrogate model or emulator for cold dark matter density fields conditional on input cosmological parameters, and as a parameter inference model that solves the inverse problem of constraining the cosmological parameters of an input field. The model is able to emulate fields with summary statistics consistent with those of the simulated target distribution. We then leverage the approximate likelihood of the diffusion generative model to derive tight constraints on cosmology by using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method to sample the posterior on cosmological parameters for a given test image. Finally, we demonstrate that this parameter inference approach is more robust to small perturbations of noise to the field than baseline parameter inference networks.

<title>On the Nature of the Dark Cavity of Solar Coronal Mass Ejections</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad98e9</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad98e9</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Earlier studies have shown that less than one-third of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) possess the archetypical three-part (bright core, dark cavity, and bright front) structure in the outer corona (e.g., 2–6 R⊙). In the traditional opinion, the core, cavity, and front correspond to the erupted filament, magnetic flux rope (MFR), and plasma pileup along the MFR border, respectively. Recent studies have demonstrated that nearly 100% of normal CMEs have a three-part structure in the inner corona (<2 R⊙), agreeing with the prediction of a new explanation of the nature of the three-part structure. In the new opinion, the core and front correspond to the MFR plasma and plasma pileup along the coronal loops, respectively. The cavity is either a part of the MFR, or a low-density zone between the front and the MFR. In this paper, we revisit a textbook case of an eruption that occurred on 2017 September 10. In the inner corona, the CME exhibited a clear three-part appearance in the extreme-ultraviolet images and had a smooth-curved front, while, in the outer corona, the CME loses the three-part feature as the core expands and the cavity disappears. Meanwhile, a bulge appears at the CME front as the core moves faster than the front and protrudes from its bottom. It is difficult to understand the disappearance of the cavity and the appearance of the bulge if assuming the cavity as being a part of the MFR. Therefore, we suggest that the dark cavity represents a low-density zone between the front and MFR in the early eruption stage.

<title>The Intrinsic Flattening of Galaxy Disks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Highly inclined (edge-on) disk galaxies offer the unique perspective to constrain their intrinsic flattening, c/a, where c and a are, respectively, the vertical and long radial axes of the disk measured at suitable stellar densities. The ratio c/a is a necessary quantity in the assessment of galaxy inclinations, three-dimensional structural reconstructions, and total masses, as well as a constraint to galaxy formation models. The 3.6 μm maps of 133 edge-on spiral galaxies from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S4G) and its early-type galaxy extension are used to revisit the assessment of c/a free from dust extinction and away from the influence of a stellar bulge. We present a simple definition of c/a and explore trends with other galactic physical parameters: total stellar mass, concentration index, total H i mass, mass of the central mass concentration, circular velocity, model-dependent scales, and Hubble type. Other than a dependence on early/late Hubble types and a related trend with light concentration, no other parameters were found to correlate with the intrinsic flattening of spiral galaxies. The latter is mostly constant with 〈c/a〉 = 0.124 ± 0.001 (stat) ± 0.033 (intrinsic/systematic) and greater for earlier types.

<title>Grain Size in the Class I Protostellar System TMC-1A Constrained with ALMA and Very Large Array Observations</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad938e</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The disk mass and substructure in young stellar objects suggest that planet formation may start at the protostellar stage, through the growth of dust grains. To accurately estimate the grain size at the protostellar stage, we have observed the Class I protostar TMC-1A using the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at the Q (7 mm) and Ka (9 mm) bands at a resolution of ∼0.″2 and analyzed archival data of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at Bands 6 (1.3 mm) and 7 (0.9 mm) that cover the same spatial scale. The VLA images show a compact structure with a size of ∼25 au and a spectral index of ∼2.5. The ALMA images show compact and extended structures with a spectral index of ∼2 at the central ∼40 au region and another index of ∼3.3 in the outer region. Our spectral energy distribution analysis using the observed fluxes at the four bands suggests one branch with a small grain size of ∼0.12 mm and another with a grown grain size of ∼4 mm. We also model polarized dust continuum emission adopting the two grain sizes and compare them with an observational result of TMC-1A, suggesting that the small grain size is preferable to the grown grain size. The small grain size implies gravitational instability in the TMC-1A disk, which is consistent with a spiral-like component recently identified.

<title>Toward Understanding the Evolutionary Role of Star-forming Lenticular Galaxies: New H i Detections and Comparison with Quiescent S0s and Red Spirals</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
As one type of blue early-type galaxy, the evolutionary history and fate of star-forming lenticular galaxies (S0s) remain elusive. We selected 134 star-forming S0s from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV MaNGA survey and found that they have steep and warped size–mass relations, similar to quiescent S0s and red spirals, indicating that they may have similar gas dissipation scenarios. These galaxies have a higher central stellar mass surface density than normal blue spirals. The radial profiles of Dn4000 and [Mgb/Fe] show that red spirals and quiescent S0s have similar old central populations and high [Mgb/Fe] values, suggesting rapid bulge formation, though red spirals exhibit a steeper gradient possibly due to residual star formation (SF) in outer regions. In contrast, star-forming S0s exhibit profiles between quiescent S0s/red spirals and normal blue spirals, with relatively flat Dn4000 and [Mgb/Fe] gradients. More long-term SF history causes normal blue spirals to have very flat Dn4000 and [Mgb/Fe] profiles, and the majority of them (79% ± 5%) have a Sérsic index of <2. We also found that the halo mass of star-forming S0s resembles that of quiescent S0s/red spirals, with 82% ± 5% exceeding the critical mass (Mhalo = 1012M⊙h−1). To supplement previous H i detection of star-forming S0s covered by H iMaNGA, we obtained new observations for H i emission from 41 star-forming S0s in our sample using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope. We found that the H i mass distribution of star-forming S0s matches that of normal blue spirals, although both star-forming S0s and red spirals are relatively gas-poor, resulting in varying atomic gas depletion times due to different SF levels. Based on these observational results, we discuss the possible evolutionary scenarios of star-forming S0s.

<title>Threshold Mass of the General-relativistic Instability for Supermassive Star Cores</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The dependence of the final fate of supermassive star (SMS) cores on their mass and angular momentum is studied with simple modeling. SMS cores in the hydrogen-burning phase encounter the general-relativistic instability during stellar evolution if the mass is larger than ∼3 × 104M⊙. Spherical SMS cores in the helium-burning phase encounter the general-relativistic instability prior to the onset of the electron–positron pair instability if the mass is larger than ∼1 × 104M⊙. For rapidly rotating SMS cores, these values for the threshold mass are enhanced by up to a factor of ∼5, and thus, for SMSs with mass smaller than ∼104M⊙, the collapse is triggered by the pair instability, irrespective of the rotation. After the onset of the general-relativistic instability, SMS cores in the hydrogen-burning phase with reasonable metallicity are likely to collapse to a black hole irrespective of the degree of rotation, whereas SMS cores in the helium-burning phase could explode via nuclear burning with no black hole formation, as previous works demonstrate.

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad93a5</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The heliosphere is influenced by the interaction of neutral hydrogen atoms from the interstellar medium with protons in the heliosheath (HS). The confinement by the solar magnetic field of the HS plasma forms distinct north and south heliospheric jets. Previous global MHD simulations of the heliosphere reveal that instabilities can develop in the heliospheric jets and make them become unstable, giving rise to large-scale turbulence. In this study, we show that there is a low-speed region of solar wind in the HS that provides a precondition for instabilities to develop. The low-speed region is formed due to charge exchange and magnetic tension. This region allows sufficient time for the instabilities to develop and induces a shear flow inside the HS leading to the development of a Kelvin–Helmholtz (K-H) instability. The estimated growth timescale of the K-H instability based on the simulation results is around 5–7 yr. Understanding the development of the instabilities in the HS is crucial for comprehending the dynamic processes within the HS and the structure of the heliosphere.

<title>Long Plateau Doth So: How Internal Heating Sources Affect Hydrogen-rich Supernova Light Curves</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Some hydrogen-rich core-collapse supernovae (SNeIIP) exhibit evidence of a sustained energy source powering their light curves, resulting in a brighter and/or longer-lasting hydrogen recombination plateau phase. We present a semi-analytic SNIIP light-curve model that accounts for the effects of an arbitrary internal heating source, considering as special cases 56Ni/56Co decay, a central engine (magnetar or accreting compact object), and shock interaction with a dense circumstellar disk. While a sustained internal power source can boost the plateau luminosity commensurate with the magnitude of the power, the duration of the recombination plateau can typically be increased by at most a factor of ∼2–3 compared to the zero-heating case. For a given ejecta mass and initial kinetic energy, the longest plateau duration is achieved for a constant heating rate at the highest magnitude that does not appreciably accelerate the ejecta. This finding has implications for the minimum ejecta mass required to explain particularly long-lasting SNe, such as iPTF14hls, and for confidently identifying rare explosions of the most massive hydrogen-rich (e.g., Population III) stars. We present a number of analytic estimates that elucidate the key features of the detailed model.

<title>Precise Measurements of the LMC Bar’s Geometry with Gaia DR3 and a Novel Solution to Crowding-induced Incompleteness in Star Counting</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present new measurements of the 2D geometry of the LMC’s stellar bar with precise astrometric observations of red clump stars in Gaia DR3. We develop a novel solution to tackle crowding-induced incompleteness in Gaia data sets with the Gaia BP-RP color excess. Utilizing the color excess information, we derive a 2D completeness map of the LMC’s disk. We find that incompleteness biases the bar measurements and induces large uncertainties. With the completeness-corrected 2D red clump map, we precisely measure the LMC bar’s properties using Fourier decomposition. The bar radius (semimajor axis) is kpc, and its position angle is 121.°26 ± 0.°21. The bar’s strength as quantified by the Fourier bi-symmetric amplitude is Sbar = 0.27, indicating that the LMC has a significant bar perturbation. We find the bar has an axis ratio of 0.54 ± 0.03, and is offset with respect to the center of the outer disk isophote at R ≈ 5 kpc by 0.76 ± 0.01 kpc. These LMC bar properties agree with a hydrodynamic model where the SMC has undergone a recent direct collision with the LMC. We compare the LMC’s bar properties with other barred galaxies in the local Universe, and discover that the LMC is similar to other barred galaxies in terms of bar-galaxy scaling relations. We discuss how our completeness correction framework can be applied to other systems in the Local Group.

<title>Diversity in Hydrogen-rich Envelope Mass of Type II Supernovae. II. SN 2023ixf as Explosion of Partially Stripped Intermediate Massive Star</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8d5a</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8d5a</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
SN 2023ixf is one of the most well-observed core-collapse supernovae in recent decades, yet there is inconsistency in the inferred zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) mass MZAMS of its progenitor. Direct observations of the pre-supernova (SN) red supergiant (RSG) estimate MZAMS spanning widely from 11 to 18 M⊙. Additional constraints, including the host environment and the pulsation of its progenitor RSG, suggest a massive progenitor with MZAMS > 17 M⊙. However, the analysis of the SN properties, from light-curve modeling to late-phase spectroscopy, favors a relatively low-mass scenario (MZAMS < 15 M⊙). In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of SN 2023ixf, from the RSG progenitor, plateau phase light curve to late-phase spectroscopy. Using MESA+STELLA to simulate the RSG progenitor and their explosions, we find that a range of the RSG models having MZAMS that vary from 12 to 17.5 M⊙ can reproduce its multiband light curves if the hydrogen-rich envelope mass and the explosion energy are allowed to vary. Using late-phase spectroscopy as an independent measurement, the oxygen line [O i] indicates an intermediate-massive progenitor (MZAMS ∼ 16.0 M⊙). By incorporating the velocity structure derived from the light-curve modeling into an axisymmetric model, we generated [O i] line profiles that are consistent with the [O i] line observed in late-phase spectroscopy of SN 2023ixf. Bringing these analyses together, we conclude that SN 2023ixf is the aspherical explosion of an intermediate-massive star (MZAMS = 15–16 M⊙), with the hydrogen envelope being stripped to 4–5 M⊙ prior to its explosion.

The sample includes 1534 δ Sct stars, 367 γ Dor stars, 1703 δ Sct ∣γ Dor stars, 270 γ Dor ∣δ Sct stars, along with 105 “dsct candidates” and 32 “gdor candidates”. After correcting for projection effects, we derived the equatorial rotational velocity distribution for δ Sct and γ Dor stars and compared it with that of normal stars. The rotational velocity distributions of δ Sct and γ Dor stars are extremely similar, with the only difference potentially due to the rotational variable stars that have not been completely removed. In contrast, the rotational velocity distribution of normal stars is more dispersed compared to pulsating stars. Additionally, the peak rotational velocity of the pulsating stars is about 10 km s−1 higher than that of normal stars. Unlike the normal stars, which show a monotonic increase in peak velocity with mass between 1.8 and 2.5 M⊙, the rotational velocity distribution of δ Sct stars does not exhibit a strong mass dependence. We also found that normal stars accelerate during the late main-sequence evolutionary phase, while δ Sct stars decelerate. Furthermore, there may still be unclassified stars with diverse rotational properties in the normal star sample compared to the δ Sct stars, which is likely to be an important contributor to the broader dispersion observed in its rotational velocity distribution. The photometric amplitude in δ Sct stars is modulated with rotational velocity, with high-amplitude stars typically rotating slowly and low-amplitude stars showing a broad distribution of rotational velocities.

<title>Engine-fed Kilonovae (Mergernovae). II. Radiation</title>

The radioactive power generated by materials within the ejecta of a binary-neutron-star (BNS) merger powers an optical transient known as a kilonova. When the central remnant of a BNS merger is a long-lived magnetar, it continuously produces a highly magnetized wind, altering both the dynamics and temperature of the ejecta, leading to the expected emergence of an engine-fed kilonova. In the first paper of this series, we conducted a detailed study of the dynamics of wind-ejecta interaction and the efficiency of energy injection through shocks. In this work, we combine this dynamical evolution with both shock-heating and additional X-ray irradiation to model photon diffusion within a constant-opacity ejecta. By calculating the radiation, we obtain the light curve and spectral energy distribution (SED). Our findings reveal that, with energy injection, a blue bump typically appears in the early stages (≲1 day). Furthermore, if the magnetar has not spun down by that time, a brightening in the later stages occurs. Despite this, in a large parameter space, the expected luminosity of the engine-fed kilonova is not significantly higher than the typical r-process kilonova due to limited heating efficiency. The SED of engine-fed kilonovae peaks in the relatively blue band in the early stages and evolves toward the red, but at a slower rate compared to the typical r-process kilonova.

<title>Radial Velocity and Astrometric Evidence for a Close Companion to Betelgeuse</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad93c8</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We examine a century of radial velocity, visual magnitude, and astrometric observations of the nearest red supergiant, Betelgeuse, in order to reexamine the century-old assertion that Betelgeuse might be a spectroscopic binary. These data reveal Betelgeuse varying stochastically over years and decades due to its boiling, convective envelope, periodically with a 5.78 yr long secondary period (LSP), and quasiperiodically from pulsations with periods of several hundred days. We show that the LSP is consistent between astrometric and radial velocity data sets, and argue that it indicates a low-mass companion to Betelgeuse, less than a solar mass, orbiting in a 2110 day period at a separation of just over twice Betelgeuse’s radius. The companion star would be nearly 20 times less massive and a million times fainter than Betelgeuse, with similar effective temperature, effectively hiding it in plain sight near one of the best-studied stars in the night sky. The astrometric data favor an edge-on binary with orbital plane aligned with Betelgeuse’s measured spin axis. Tidal spin–orbit interaction drains angular momentum from the orbit and spins up Betelgeuse, explaining the spin–orbit alignment and Betelgeuse’s anomalously rapid spin. In the future, the orbit will decay until the companion is swallowed by Betelgeuse in the next 10,000 yr.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The study of pulsar glitch phenomena serves as a valuable probe into the dynamic properties of matter under extreme high-density conditions, offering insights into the physics within neutron stars. Providing theoretical explanations for the diverse manifestations observed in different pulsars has proven to be a formidable challenge. By analyzing the distribution of glitch sizes and waiting times, along with the evolution of cumulative glitch sizes over time, we have uncovered a long-term clustering phenomenon for pulsar glitches. This perspective allows us to approach the distinct glitch representations in various pulsars from a unified standpoint, connecting the same periodicity of observational data to the randomness. Without relying on specific physical models, we utilized the coefficient of variation to numerically determine optimal clustering numbers and clustering periods for sample pulsars. Our analysis involving 27 pulsars has revealed a clear linear relationship between the glitch cluster period and characteristic age. Of interest, the cumulative distribution of functions of cluster sizes and interval times have the same patterns, which can be synchronously fitted by Gaussian processes. These results may indicate novel understandings of glitches and the resulting processes.

<title>A Novel Approach to Understanding the Link between Supermassive Black Holes and Host Galaxies</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad93d4</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The strongest and most universal scaling relation between a supermassive black hole (BH) and its host galaxy is known as the M•–σ relation, where M• is the mass of the central BH, and σ is the stellar velocity dispersion of the host galaxy. This relation has been studied for decades and is crucial for estimating BH masses of distant galaxies. However, recent studies suggest the potential absence of central BHs in some galaxies, and a significant portion of current data only provides upper limits for the mass. Here, we introduce a novel approach using a Bayesian hurdle model to analyze the M•–σ relation across 244 galaxies. This model integrates upper mass limits and the likelihood of hosting a central BH, combining logistic regression for BH hosting probability with a linear regression of mass on σ. From the logistic regression, we find that galaxies with a velocity dispersion of 11, 34, and 126 km s−1 have a 50%, 90%, and 99% probability of hosting a central BH, respectively. Furthermore, from the linear regression portion of the model, we find that M• ∝ σ5.8, which is significantly steeper than the slope reported in earlier studies. Our model also predicts a population of undermassive BHs (M• = 10–105M⊙) in galaxies with σ ≲ 127 km s−1 and overmassive BHs (M• ≥ 1.8 × 107) above this threshold. This reveals an unexpected abundance of galaxies with intermediate-mass and ultramassive BHs, accessible to next-generation telescopes like the Extremely Large Telescope.

<title>Decoding the Future of Exoplanets: Asteroseismic Confirmation of Subgiant and Red Giant Hosts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Asteroseismology has emerged as a powerful tool to unravel the intricate relationships between evolved stars and their planetary systems. In this study, we leverage this technique to investigate the evolutionary stages of five exoplanet host stars, each exhibiting solar-like oscillations. Building on our previous work that identified two host stars as red clump and red giant branch (RGB) stars, this study focuses on a new and broader sample. By precisely measuring asteroseismic parameters such as the period spacing of dipole gravity modes (ΔΠ1), we provide definitive confirmation of these stars’ evolutionary states as subgiants or RGB stars. These results are not only crucial for understanding the internal structures of evolved stars but also for predicting the eventual fate of their planetary companions, which may face engulfment as their host stars expand. This research highlights the profound role of asteroseismology in advancing our knowledge of planetary system evolution and opens new pathways for exploring how stellar evolution impacts planetary survival. Our findings set the stage for future studies on the dynamic fates of exoplanets, providing key insights into the intricate processes of stellar and planetary evolution.

<title>Diversity in Hydrogen-rich Envelope Mass of Type II Supernovae. I. Plateau Phase Light-curve Modeling</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b19</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b19</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a systematic study of Type II supernovae (SNe II) originating from progenitors with effective temperatures (Teff) and luminosities closely resembling red supergiants (RSGs) observed in pre-supernova (SN) images and in the Galaxy. Using Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics, we compute a large grid of massive stars with Teff ranging from 3200 to 3800 K at their RSG phases, with hydrogen envelopes artificially stripped to varying extents (3–10 M⊙). The light curves of SNe IIP resulting from the explosions of these Galactic-RSG–like progenitors are modeled using STELLA. Our survey of the light curves reveals that partial stripping of the hydrogen envelope creates diversity in the magnitude and duration of SNe IIP light curves, without affecting the position of the RSG progenitor on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. For these Galactic-RSG-like progenitor models, we establish an indicator based on the light-curve properties to estimate the hydrogen envelope mass. Additionally, we discuss the effects of material mixing and 56Ni heating. Applying our model grid to a large sample of approximately 100 observed SNe IIP reveals a considerably broader range of hydrogen-rich envelope masses than predicted by standard stellar wind models. This finding suggests that if SNe IIP are explosions of Galactic-like RSGs to explain the diversity in the observed light curves, a significant fraction of them must have experienced substantial mass loss beyond the standard mass-loss prescription prior to their explosions. This finding highlights the uncertainties involved in massive star evolution and the pre-SN mass-loss mechanism.

<title>Once a Triple, Not Always a Triple: The Evolution of Hierarchical Triples That Yield Merged Inner Binaries</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad944a</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad944a</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
More than half of all main-sequence (MS) stars have one or more companions, and many of those with initial masses <8 M⊙ are born in hierarchical triples. These systems feature two stars in a close orbit (the inner binary) while a tertiary star orbits them on a wider orbit (the outer binary). In hierarchical triples, three-body dynamics combined with stellar evolution drives interactions and, in many cases, merges the inner binary entirely to create a renovated “post-merger binary” (PMB). By leveraging dynamical simulations and tracking binary interactions, we explore the outcomes of merged triples and investigate whether PMBs preserve signatures of their three-body history. Our findings indicate that in 26%–54% of wide double white dwarf (DWD) binaries (s ≳ 100 au), the more massive white dwarf (WD) is a merger product, implying that these DWD binaries were previously triples. Overall, we estimate that 44% ± 14% of observed wide DWDs originated in triple star systems and thereby have rich dynamical histories. We also examine MS+MS and MS+red giant mergers manifesting as blue straggler stars (BSSs). These PMBs have orbital configurations and ages similar to most observed BSS binaries. While the triple+merger formation channel can explain the observed chemical abundances, moderate eccentricities, and companion masses in BSS binaries, it likely only accounts for ∼20%–25% of BSSs. Meanwhile, we predict that the majority of observed single BSSs formed as collisions in triples and harbor long-period (>10 yr) companions. Furthermore, both BSS binaries and DWDs exhibit signatures of WD birth kicks.

<title>Separating Super-puffs versus Hot Jupiters among Young Puffy Planets</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad946c</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Discoveries of close-in young puffy (Rp ≳ 6 R⊕) planets raise the question of whether they are bona fide hot Jupiters or puffed-up Neptunes, potentially placing constraints on the formation location and timescale of hot Jupiters. Obtaining mass measurements for these planets is challenging due to stellar activity and noisy spectra. Therefore, we aim to provide independent theoretical constraints on the masses of these young planets based on their radii, incident fluxes, and ages, benchmarking to the planets of age <1 Gyr detected by Kepler, K2, and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. Through a combination of interior structure models, considerations of photoevaporative mass loss, and empirical mass–metallicity trends, we present the range of possible masses for 22 planets with an age of ∼10–900 Myr and radii of ∼6–16 R⊕. We generally find that our mass estimates are in agreement with the measured masses and upper limits where applicable. There exist some outliers including super-puffs Kepler-51 b, c and V1298 Tau d, b, e, for which we outline their likely formation conditions. Our analyses demonstrate that most of the youngest planets (≲100 Myr) tend to be puffed-up, Neptune-mass planets, while the true hot Jupiters are typically found around stars aged at least a few hundred Myr, suggesting the dominant origin of hot Jupiters to be late-stage high-eccentricity migration.

<title>Spectral Energy Distribution Modeling of BL Lacertae during a Large Submillimeter Outburst and Low X-Ray Polarization State</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In 2023 October–November, the blazar BL Lacertae underwent a very large-amplitude submillimeter outburst. The usual single-zone leptonic model with the lower-energy peak of the spectral energy distribution (SED) fit by the synchrotron emission from one distribution of relativistic electrons in the jet and inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of lower-energy photons from the synchrotron radiation in the jet itself (synchrotron self-Compton or SSC) or those from the broad-line region and torus by the same distribution of electrons cannot satisfactorily fit the broadband SED with simultaneous data at submillimeter, optical, X-ray, and GeV energies. Furthermore, simultaneous observations with IXPE indicate the X-ray polarization is undetected. We consider two different synchrotron components, one for the high flux in the submillimeter wavelengths and another for the data at the optical band, which are supposedly due to two separate distributions of electrons. In that case, the optical emission is dominated by the synchrotron radiation from one electron distribution, while the X-rays are mostly due to SSC process by another, which may result in low polarization fraction due to the IC scattering. We show that such a model can fit the broadband SED satisfactorily as well as explain the low polarization fraction at the X-rays.

<title>Chemical Links between a Young M-type T Tauri Star and Its Substellar Companion: Spectral Analysis and C/O Measurement of DH Tau A</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The chemical abundance measurements of host stars and their substellar companions provide a powerful tool to trace the formation mechanism of the planetary systems. We present a detailed high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of a young M-type star, DH Tau A, which is located in the Taurus molecular cloud belonging to the Taurus-Auriga star-forming region. This star is host to a low-mass companion, DH Tau b, and both the star and the companion are still in their accreting phase. We apply our technique to measure the abundances of carbon and oxygen using carbon- and oxygen-bearing molecules, such as CO and OH, respectively. We determine a near-solar carbon-to-oxygen abundance ratio of C/O = 0.555 ± 0.063 for the host star DH Tau A. We compare this stellar abundance ratio with that of the companion from our previous study ( ), which also has a near-solar value. This confirms the chemical homogeneity in the DH Tau system, which suggests a formation scenario for the companion consistent with a direct and relatively fast gravitational collapse rather than a slow core accretion process.

<title>Central versus Global Quenching Traced by the APEX-CALIFA Survey</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The quest for the mechanisms that halt star formation in galaxies is essential to understand their evolution. Here, we use the APEX-CALIFA survey, which includes 560 galaxies (0.005 < z < 0.08), so far the largest sample of galaxies in the nearby universe with both Integral Field Spectroscopic, Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) and single-aperture millimeter observations, as well as the extended CALIFA sample (823 targets). Using these observations we derive (i) the deficit or excess of star formation for a given stellar mass with respect to the star formation main sequence (ΔSFMS), (ii) the gas fraction, and (iii) the star formation efficiency (SFE) for two apertures (central and global apertures using the APEX-CALIFA and CALIFA samples, respectively). We confirm the so-called “inside-out” quenching, that is, for quiescent galaxies the central values of ΔSFMS are usually smaller than those values derived from global measurements. However, for a given ΔSFMS we find that for retired galaxies the central gas fraction is larger in comparison to global measurements. Furthermore, the central SFE is significantly smaller in comparison to global counterparts. In general, in comparison to the global measurements, the deficit of star formation at the center of retired galaxies is primarily caused by the inefficiency to form new stars rather than the lack of molecular gas. We suggest that even though at the center of retired galaxies the gas fraction is larger, morphological structures could prevent that the molecular gas is transformed into new stars. Even more so in the outskirts of some retired galaxies with small gas fractions, star formation activity is still occurring.

<title>JWST Captures a Sudden Stellar Outburst and Inner Disk Wall Destruction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We analyze JWST/MIRI observations of T Cha, a highly variable (ΔV ∼ 3–5 mag) accreting Sun-like star surrounded by a disk with a large (∼15 au) dust gap. We find that the JWST mid-IR spectrum is significantly different from the Spitzer spectrum obtained 17 yr before—the emission at short wavelengths (5–10 μm) has decreased by ∼2/3 while that at longer wavelengths (15–25 μm) has increased by up to a factor of ∼3. The JWST spectrum is contemporaneous with a fairly constant higher optical emission captured by the All Sky Automated Survey. After analyzing and modeling both spectral energy distributions, we propose that JWST caught the star during an outburst that partly destroyed and significantly reduced the height of the asymmetric inner disk wall responsible for the high optical variability and lower 15–25 μm emission during the Spitzer period. The dust mass lost during this outburst is estimated to be comparable (∼1/5) to the upper limit of the total micron-sized dust mass in the inner disk of T Cha now. Monitoring this system during possible future outbursts and more observations of its quiescent state will reveal if the inner disk can be replenished or will continue to be depleted and vanish.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Empirically, the total number (or total mass) of globular clusters (GCs) bound in a single galactic system correlates with the virial mass of the system. The form of this relation and its intrinsic scatter are potentially valuable constraints on theories of GC formation and galaxy evolution. In this work, we use the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey (DESI-LS) to make a large-scale, homogeneous estimate of GC abundance around 707 galaxies at distances ≲30 Mpc with luminosities . The combination of depth and sky coverage in DESI-LS allow us to extend the techniques used by previous ground-based photometric GC surveys to a larger and potentially more representative sample of galaxies. We find average GC counts and radial profiles that are broadly consistent with the literature on individual galaxies, including good agreement with the distribution of GCs in the Milky Way, demonstrating the viability of DESI-LS images for this purpose. We find a relation between GC counts and virial mass in agreement with previous estimates based on heterogenous data sets, except at the lowest masses we probe, where we find a larger scatter in the number of cluster candidates and a slightly higher average count.

<title>Starspots as an Explanation for the Mysterious IYJ Continuum Excess Emission in Classical T Tauri Stars</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad93c6</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An accurate estimation of the continuum excess emission from accretion spots and inner circumstellar disk regions is crucial for a proper derivation of fundamental stellar parameters in accreting systems. However, the presence of starspots can make disentangling the complicated multicomponent emission in these systems challenging. Subtraction of a single-temperature spectral template is insufficient to account for the composite stellar emission, as we demonstrated in a recent campaign involving weak-lined T Tauri stars. Here, we model the moderate-resolution near-infrared spectra of classical T Tauri stars, presenting new spectral models that incorporate spotted stars plus emission from accretion hot spots and a warm inner disk, allowing us to simultaneously reconstruct the entire 0.8–2.4 μm spectrum of our 16 targets. Using these models, we re-derive the continuum excess emission. Our results indicate that accounting for starspots resolves the need to include a previously proposed intermediate-temperature component in the IYJ excess and highlights the importance of a proper treatment of starspots in studies of accreting low-mass stars.

<title>The NANOGrav 15 yr Data Set: Looking for Signs of Discreteness in the Gravitational-wave Background</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The cosmic merger history of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) is expected to produce a low-frequency gravitational wave background (GWB). Here we investigate how signs of the discrete nature of this GWB can manifest in pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) through excursions from, and breaks in, the expected power law of the GWB strain spectrum. To do this, we create a semianalytic SMBHB population model, fit to North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav’s) 15 yr GWB amplitude, and with 1000 realizations, we study the populations’ characteristic strain and residual spectra. Comparing our models to the NANOGrav 15 yr spectrum, we find two interesting excursions from the power law. The first, at 2 nHz, is below our GWB realizations with a p-value significance p = 0.05–0.06 (≈1.8σ–1.9σ). The second, at 16 nHz, is above our GWB realizations with p = 0.04–0.15 (≈1.4σ–2.1σ). We explore the properties of a loud SMBHB that could cause such an excursion. Our simulations also show that the expected number of SMBHBs decreases by 3 orders of magnitude, from ∼106 to ∼103, between 2 and 20 nHz. This causes a break in the strain spectrum as the stochasticity of the background breaks down at , consistent with predictions pre-dating GWB measurements. The diminished GWB signal from SMBHBs at frequencies above the 26 nHz break opens a window for PTAs to detect continuous GWs from individual SMBHBs or GWs from the early Universe.

<title>Self-excited Pulsations and the Instability Strip of Long-period Variables: The Transition from Small-amplitude Red Giants to Semi-regular Variables</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9475</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We use one-dimensional hydrodynamic calculations combined with synthetic stellar population models of the Magellanic Clouds to study the onset of self-excited pulsation in luminous red giants. By comparing the results with Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment observations in the period–luminosity (PL) diagram, we are able to link the transition from small-amplitude red giants to semi-regular variables with a shift from stochastic driving to self-excited pulsations. This is consistent with previous studies relating this transition with an increase in mass-loss rate, dust formation, and the appearance of long secondary periods. The luminosity and effective temperature at the onset of pulsation are found to depend on metallicity, hydrogen content, and the adopted mixing length parameter. This confirms the role of partial hydrogen ionization in driving the pulsation, supporting the idea of a heat mechanism similar to that of classical pulsators. We examine the impact of turbulent viscosity, and find clear evidence that it must be adjusted according to the stellar chemical and physical parameters to fully match observations. In order to improve the predictive power of pulsation models, the turbulent viscosity and the temperature scale of pulsating red giants must be jointly calibrated. This is critical for model-based studies of the PL relations of evolved stars and to exploit their potential as distance and age indicators, in particular given the sensitivity of the onset of pulsation to the envelope composition. The grid of models is made publicly available with a companion interpolation routine.

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most energetic explosions in the Universe, and their afterglow emission provides an opportunity to probe the physics of relativistic shock waves in an extreme environment. Several key pieces for completing the picture of GRB afterglow physics are still missing, including jet properties, the emission mechanism, and particle acceleration. Here, we present a study of the afterglow emission of GRB 221009A, the most energetic GRB ever observed. Using optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray data up to approximately 2 days after the trigger, we trace the evolution of the multiwavelength spectrum and the physical parameters behind the emission process. The broadband spectrum is consistent with the synchrotron emission emitted by relativistic electrons with its index of p = 2.29 ± 0.02. We identify a break energy at keV and an exponential cutoff at GeV in the observed multiwavelength spectrum. The break energy increases in time from keV at 0.65 days to keV at 1.68 days, favoring a stellar-wind-like profile of the circumburst medium with k = 2.4 ± 0.1 as in ρ(r) ∝ r−k. The high-energy attenuation at around 0.4 to 4 GeV is attributed to the maximum of the particle acceleration in the relativistic shock wave. This study confirms that the synchrotron process can explain the multiwavelength afterglow emission and its evolution.

<title>SOFIA/HAWC+ Far-infrared Polarimetric Large-area CMZ Exploration Survey. IV. Relative Magnetic Field Orientation throughout the CMZ</title>

The nature of the magnetic field structure throughout the Galactic Center (GC) has long been of interest. The recent Far-InfraREd Polarimetric Large-Area Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) Exploration (FIREPLACE) Survey reveals preliminary connections between the seemingly distinct vertical and horizontal magnetic field distributions previously observed in the GC. We use the statistical techniques of the Histogram of Relative Orientation and the Projected Rayleigh Statistic to assess whether the CMZ magnetic field preferentially aligns with the structure of the CMZ molecular clouds or the morphology of the nonthermal emission of the GC nonthermal filament (NTF) population. We find that there is a range of magnetic field orientations throughout the population of CMZ molecular clouds, ranging from parallel to perpendicular orientation. We posit these orientations depend on the prevalence of gravitational shear in the GC, in contrast with what is observed in Galactic Disk star-forming regions. We also compare the magnetic field orientation from dust polarimetry with individual prominent NTFs, finding a preferred perpendicular relative orientation. This perpendicular orientation indicates that the vertical field component found in the FIREPLACE observations is not spatially confined to the NTFs, providing evidence for a more pervasive vertical field in the GC. From dynamical arguments, we estimate an upper limit on the magnetic field strength for this vertical field, finding B ≤ 4 mG. A field close to this upper limit would indicate that the NTFs are not local enhancements of a weaker background field and that the locations of the NTFs depend on proximity to sites of cosmic-ray production.

<title>The Impact of the Angle-average Approximation in the Partial Frequency Redistribution Modeling of the Mg ii h–k Doublet Stokes Profiles</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In recent years, the Mg ii h and k lines have become increasingly important for the diagnostics of magnetic fields in the solar chromosphere, motivated both by the advances in the modeling capabilities of their polarization and by the unprecedented spectropolarimetric observations provided by the CLASP missions. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the angular and frequency coupling in coherent scattering processes in the radiative transfer modeling of the Mg ii doublet polarization profiles. In particular, we aim to assess how the widely used angle-average approximation affects the predicted polarization. By solving the radiative transfer problem in 1D semiempirical atmospheric models, we find that this approximation is suitable in the absence of magnetic fields, but there can be measurable differences in magnetized models, mainly in the linear polarization profiles close to the core of the Mg ii k line. We then test the suitability of the approximation in more realistic scenarios, solving the radiative transfer problem pixel-by-pixel in a 3D atmospheric model resulting from a magnetohydrodynamic simulation and mimicking the degradation of the CLASP2 instrument, as well as in several 1D atmospheric models resulting from the Stokes inversion of the CLASP2 data. We find that the impact of the angle-average approximation is greatly diminished at the resolution of the CLASP2 observations. We also find that to suitably include angle-dependent effects in 1D radiative transfer modeling, it is sufficient to initialize the problem with the angle-average solution and then perform a few (angle-dependent) iterations, dramatically reducing the computational cost.

<title>Stability of f(Q, B) Gravity via Dynamical System Approach: A Comprehensive Bayesian Statistical Analysis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this work, we explore the cosmological stability of f(Q, B) gravity using a dynamical system approach, where Q denotes the nonmetricity scalar and B represents the boundary term. We determine the model parameters of f(Q, B) through Bayesian statistical analysis, employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. This analysis incorporates numerical solutions and observational data from cosmic chronometers, the extended Pantheon+ data set, and baryonic acoustic oscillation measurements. Our findings reveal a stable critical point within the dynamical system of the model, corresponding to the de Sitter phase, which is consistent with current observations of the Universe dominated by dark energy and undergoing late-time accelerated expansion. Additionally, we utilize center manifold theory to examine the stability of this critical point, providing deeper insights into the behavior of the model. The cosmological implications of f(Q, B) gravity indicate a smooth transition in the deceleration parameters from deceleration to the acceleration phase, underscoring the potential of the model to describe the evolution of the Universe. Our results suggests that the f(Q, B) model presents a viable alternative to the standard ΛCDM model, effectively capturing the observed acceleration of the Universe and offering a robust framework for explaining the dynamics of cosmic expansion.

<title>Depolarization by Jet Precession in Early Optical Afterglows of Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>

Polarization observations provide a unique way to probe the nature of jet magnetic fields in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Recently, some GRBs have been detected to be polarized in their early optical afterglows. However, the measured polarization degrees (PDs) of these GRBs are much lower than those predicted by theoretical models. In this work, we investigate the depolarization induced by jet precession in combination with the measured PDs of the GRB early optical afterglows in the reverse shock (RS) dominated phase (∼102–103 s). We calculate the PDs of RS emissions with and without jet precession in both magnetic field configurations, i.e., aligned and toroidal magnetic fields, and meanwhile explore the effects of different parameters on the PDs. We find that the PDs are slightly affected by the configurations of the ordered magnetic fields and are positively related to the precession period. Moreover, the PDs are sensitive to the observed angle, and the measured low PDs favor a small one. Thus, as one of the plausible origins of the structured jets, jet precession could be considered as an alternative mechanism for the low PDs observed in GRB early optical afterglows.

<title>MAGAZ3NE: Evidence for Galactic Conformity in z ≳ 3 Protoclusters*</title>

We examine the quiescent fractions of massive galaxies in six z ≳ 3 spectroscopically confirmed protoclusters in the COSMOS field, one of which is newly confirmed and presented here. We report the spectroscopic confirmation of MAGAZ3NE J100143+023021 at by the Massive Ancient Galaxies At z > 3 NEar-infrared (MAGAZ3NE) survey. MAGAZ3NE J100143+023021 contains a total of 79 protocluster members (28 spectroscopic and 51 photometric). Three spectroscopically confirmed members are star-forming ultramassive galaxies (UMGs; > 11), the most massive of which has . Combining Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy and the COSMOS2020 photometric catalog, we use a weighted Gaussian kernel density estimator to map the protocluster and measure its total mass in the dense “core” region. For each of the six COSMOS protoclusters, we compare the quiescent fraction to the status of the central UMG as star-forming or quiescent. We observe that galaxies in these protoclusters appear to obey galactic conformity: Elevated quiescent fractions are found in protoclusters with UVJ-quiescent UMGs and low quiescent fractions are found in protoclusters containing UVJ star-frming UMGs. This correlation of star formation/quiescence in UMGs and the massive galaxies nearby in these protoclusters is the first evidence for the existence of galactic conformity at z > 3. Despite disagreements over mechanisms behind conformity at low redshifts, its presence at these early cosmic times would provide strong constraints on the physics proposed to drive galactic conformity.

<title>Testing the Universality of Self-organized Criticality in Galactic, Extragalactic, and Black Hole Systems</title>

In this study, we test whether the power law slopes (αF) for fluxes (F), and (αE) for energies (E) are universal in their size distributions, and , in astrophysical observations of galactic, extragalactic, and black hole systems. This is a test of fundamental importance for self-organized criticality (SOC) systems. The test decides whether (i) power laws are a natural consequence of the scale-freeness and inherent universality of SOC systems, or (ii) if they depend on more complex physical scaling laws. The former criterion allows quantitative predictions of the power-law-like size distributions, while the latter criterion requires individual physical modeling for each SOC variable and data set. Our statistical test, carried out with 61 published data sets, is consistent with the former option, which implies that observed power laws can simply be derived from the scale-freeness and do not require specific physical models to understand their statistical distributions. The observations show a mean and standard deviation of αF = 1.78 ± 0.29 for SOC fluxes and αE = 1.66 ± 0.22 for SOC fluences, and thus are consistent with the prediction of the fractal-diffusive SOC model, with αF = 1.80 and αE = 1.67.

<title>The Redshift-space Momentum Power Spectrum. III. Measuring the Growth Rate from the SDSSv Survey Using the Auto- and Cross-power Spectrum of the Galaxy Density and Momentum Fields</title>

The large-scale structure of the Universe and its evolution over time contains an abundance of cosmological information. One way to unlock this is by measuring the density and momentum power spectrum from the positions and peculiar velocities of galaxies and fitting the cosmological parameters from these power spectra. In this paper, we will explore the cross-power spectrum between the density and momentum fields of galaxies. We derive the estimator of the density–momentum cross-power spectrum multipoles. The growth rate of the large-scale structure, fσ8, is measured from fitting the combined density monopole, momentum monopole, and cross-dipole power spectrum. The estimators and models of the power spectrum as well as our fitting method have been tested using mock catalogs; we find that they perform well in recovering the fiducial values of the cosmological parameters of the simulations, and we also find that the errors of the parameters can be largely reduced by including the cross-power spectrum in the fit. We measure the autodensity, automomentum, and cross-power spectrum using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 14 peculiar velocity catalog. The fit result of the growth rate fσ8 is at effective redshift zeff = 0.073, and our measurement is consistent with the prediction of the Lambda cold dark matter cosmological model, assuming general relativity.

<title>Multiwavelength Study of Five Distant Transient Gamma-Ray AGNs with z > 1</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The multiwavelength emissions, especially gamma-rays, of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are essential for studying the physical properties of jets emanating from supermassive black holes at galaxy centers. However, for high-redshift AGNs, it is challenging to identify their gamma-ray emissions due to limited angular resolution of gamma-ray instruments. In this work, using the infrared light curves of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and spectral measurements through Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR16 quasar observations, we assemble 64 mid-infrared flares with redshift z > 1 as the sample. Based on the Fermi-Large Area Telescope survey data, we search for gamma-ray emission from the 64 WISE sources. New quasi-simultaneous gamma-ray emissions are detected for five sample sources when their infrared emissions are at a flare state, and the infrared positions fall into the error bars of their best-fit gamma-ray positions, as well. We collect the optical data and historical data to perform a spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis. To investigate the multiband characteristics of these five gamma-ray AGNs at flare and quiescent states, a one-zone leptonic model is applied to reproduce their averaged SEDs.

<title>Combined Fit of Spectrum and Composition for FR0 Radio-galaxy-emitted Ultra–high energy Cosmic Rays with Resulting Secondary Photons and Neutrinos</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study comprehensively investigates the gamma-ray dim population of Fanaroff–Riley Type 0 (FR0) radio galaxies as potentially significant sources of ultra–high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs, E > 1018 eV) detected on Earth. While individual FR0 luminosities are relatively low compared to the more powerful Fanaroff–Riley Type 1 and Type 2 galaxies, FR0s are substantially more prevalent in the local universe, outnumbering the more energetic galaxies by a factor of ∼5 within a redshift of z ≤ 0.05. Employing CRPropa3 simulations, we estimate the mass composition and energy spectra of UHECRs originating from FR0 galaxies for energies above 1018.6 eV. This estimation fits data from the Pierre Auger Observatory (Auger) using three extensive air shower models; both constant and energy-dependent observed elemental fractions are considered. The simulation integrates an approximately isotropic distribution of FR0 galaxies, extrapolated from observed characteristics, with UHECR propagation in the intergalactic medium, incorporating various plausible configurations of extragalactic magnetic fields, both random and structured. We then compare the resulting emission spectral indices, rigidity cutoffs, and elemental fractions with recent Auger results. In total, 25 combined energy-spectrum and mass-composition fits are considered. Beyond the cosmic-ray fluxes emitted by FR0 galaxies, this study predicts the secondary photon and neutrino fluxes from UHECR interactions with intergalactic cosmic photon backgrounds. The multimessenger approach, encompassing observational data and theoretical models, helps elucidate the contribution of low-luminosity FR0 radio galaxies to the total cosmic-ray energy density.

Gravitational waves (GWs) from primordial black holes (PBHs) inspiraling within neutron stars (NSs)—should they exist—are detectable by ground-based detectors and offer a unique insight into the internal structure of NSs. To provide accurate templates for GW searches, we solve Einstein’s equations within NSs and calculate the orbital motion of the captured PBH by considering dynamical friction, accretion, and gravitational radiation. Equipped with precise GW waveforms for PBHs inspiraling inside NSs, we find that the Einstein Telescope can differentiate between various equations of state for NSs. As PBHs inspiral deeper into NSs, the GW frequency rises near the surface, then decreases to a constant value deeper within NSs. The distinctive characteristics of GW frequency serve as the smoking gun for GW signals emitted by PBHs inspiraling inside NSs and can be used to probe the nuclear matter in the crust and core of NSs.

We present 22 GHz imaging of regions of massive star formation within the Local Wolf–Rayet Galaxy Sample, a NSF Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array survey of 30 local galaxies showing spectral features of Wolf–Rayet (WR) stars. These spectral features are present in galaxies with young super star clusters (SSCs), and are an indicator of large concentrations of massive stars. We present a catalog of 92 individually identified regions of likely free–free emission associated with potential young SSCs located in these WR galaxies. The free–free fluxes from these maps allow extinction-free estimates of the Lyman continuum rates, masses, and luminosities of the emission regions. Thirty-nine of these regions meet the minimum Lyman continuum rate to contain at least once SSC, and 29 of these regions could contain individual SSCs massive enough to test specific theories on star formation and feedback inhibition in SSCs, requiring follow-up observations at higher spatial resolution. The resulting catalog provides sources for future molecular line and IR studies into the properties of SSC formation.

<title>Investigating the Star Formation Characteristics of Radio Active Galactic Nuclei</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The coevolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies represents a fundamental question in astrophysics. One approach to investigating this question involves comparing the star formation rates (SFRs) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with those of typical star-forming galaxies. At relatively low redshifts (z ≲ 1), radio AGNs manifest diminished SFRs, indicating suppressed star formation, but their behavior at higher redshifts is unclear. To examine this, we leveraged galaxy and radio-AGN data from the well-characterized W-CDF-S, ELAIS-S1, and XMM-LSS fields. We established two mass-complete reference star-forming galaxy samples and two radio-AGN samples, consisting of 1763 and 6766 radio AGNs, the former being higher in purity and the latter more complete. We subsequently computed star-forming fractions (fSF; the fraction of star-forming galaxies to all galaxies) for galaxies and radio-AGN host galaxies and conducted a robust comparison between them up to z ≈ 3. We found that the tendency for radio AGNs to reside in massive galaxies primarily accounts for their low fSF, which also shows a strong negative dependence upon M⋆ and a strong positive evolution with z. To investigate further the star formation characteristics of those star-forming radio AGNs, we constructed the star-forming main sequence (MS) and investigated the behavior of the position of AGNs relative to the MS at z ≈ 0–3. Our results reveal that radio AGNs display lower SFRs than star-forming galaxies in the low-z and high-M⋆ regime and, conversely, exhibit comparable or higher SFRs than MS star-forming galaxies at higher redshifts or lower M⋆.

<title>Can the Central Compact Object in HESS J1731–347 Be Indeed the Lightest Neutron Star Observed?</title>

The exceptionally low mass of for the central compact object (CCO) XMMU J173203.3–344518 (XMMU J1732) in the supernova remnant (SNR) HESS J1731–347 challenges standard neutron star (NS) formation models. The nearby post–asymptotic giant branch star IRAS 17287–3443 (≈0.6M⊙), also within the SNR, enriches the scenario. To address this puzzle, we advance the possibility that the gravitational collapse of a rotating presupernova (SN) iron core (≈1.2M⊙) could result in a low-mass NS. We show that angular momentum conservation during the collapse of an iron core rotating at ≈45% of the Keplerian limit results in a mass loss of ≈0.3M⊙, producing a stable newborn NS of ≈0.9M⊙. Considering the possible spin-down, this indicates that the NS is now slowly rotating, thus fulfilling the observed mass–radius relation. Additionally, the NS's surface temperature (≈2 × 106 K) aligns with canonical thermal evolution for its ≈4.5 kyr age. We propose the pre-SN star, likely an ultrastripped core of ≈4.2M⊙, formed a tidally locked binary with IRAS 17287–3443, with a 1.43 day orbital period. The SN led to a ≈3M⊙ mass loss, imparting a kick velocity ≲670 km s−1, which disrupted the binary. This scenario explains the observed 0.3 pc offset between XMMU J1732 and IRAS 17287–3443 and supports the possibility of CCOs forming in binaries, with rotation playing a key role in core collapse, and the CCO XMMU J1732 being the lightest NS ever observed.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
NGC 1052-DF2 and -DF4 are two ultradiffuse galaxies that have been reported as deficient in dark matter and associated with the same galaxy group. Recent findings suggest that DF2 and DF4 are part of a large linear substructure of dwarf galaxies that could have been formed from a high-velocity head-on encounter of two gas-rich galaxies, known as a “bullet dwarf” collision. Based on new observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, combined with existing imaging from the u band to mid-infrared, we test the bullet dwarf scenario by studying the morphologies and stellar populations of the trail dwarfs. We find no significant morphological differences between the trail dwarfs and other dwarfs in the group, while for both populations, their photometric major axes unexpectedly align parallel with the trail. We find that the trail dwarfs have significantly older ages and higher metallicities than the comparison sample, supporting the distinctiveness of the trail. These observations provide key constraints for any formation model, and we argue that they are currently best explained by the bullet dwarf collision scenario, with additional strong tests anticipated with future observations.

<title>More Likely Than You Think: Inclination-driving Secular Resonances Are Common in Known Exoplanet Systems</title>

Multiplanet systems face significant challenges to detection. For example, farther-orbiting planets have a reduced signal-to-noise ratio in radial velocity detection methods, and small mutual inclinations between planets can prevent them from all transiting. One mechanism for exciting mutual inclination between planets is secular resonance, where the nodal precession frequencies of the planets align so as to greatly increase the efficiency of the angular momentum transport between planets. These resonances can significantly misalign planets from one another, hindering detection, and typically can only occur when there are three or more planets in the system. Naively, systems can only be in resonance for particular combinations of planet semimajor axes and masses; however, effects that alter the nodal precession frequencies of the planets, such as the decay of stellar oblateness, can significantly expand the region of parameter space where resonances occur. In this work, we explore known three-planet systems, determine whether they are in (or were in) secular resonance due to evolving stellar oblateness, and demonstrate the implications of resonance on their detectability and stability. We show that about 20% of a sample of three-planet transiting systems seem to undergo these resonances early in their lives.

Gigahertz peaked spectrum (GPS) and compact steep spectrum (CSS) sources are compact radio galaxies (RGs), with jets extending up to 20 kpc and ages <103 yr. They are considered to evolve to Fanaroff–Riley RGs, but the real scenario to explain the compact sources remains unsolved. The young compact jets make GPS/CSS ideal for studying feedback in the nuclear region of active galactic nuclei because the jets are just starting to leave this region. Numerical simulations and jet power estimates suggest that compact sources can drive outflows on scales several times larger than the radio source itself, but the lack of suitable data limits comparisons between theory and observation. We carried out an optical spectroscopic study of 82 CSS/GPS with Sloan Digital Sky Survey-DR12 data to investigate the influence of compact jets in the gas. We found outflowing gas components in the [O iii] λ5007 emission lines in half of our sample. The kinetic energy of the outflowing gas in compact sources is comparable to that observed in extended RGs, indicating that the compact jets can drive powerful outflows similar to those in FR RGs. The observed anticorrelation between the kinetic power of the outflow and the radio luminosity suggests an interaction between the young jet and the interstellar medium (ISM). This finding provides significant observational support for previous simulations of jet–ISM interactions and supports the evolutionary scenario for RGs. However, the lack of sources with high kinetic efficiency indicates that some compact galaxies may be frustrated sources.

Stellar clusters are critical constituents within galaxies: They are the result of highest-density star formation, and through their spatially and temporally correlated feedback, they regulate their host galaxy evolution. We present a novel numerical method to model star clusters as individual units of star formation using sink particles. In our method, star clusters grow via gas accretion and via merging with less massive clusters. We describe the implementation in the radiation hydrodynamics code GIZMO and run a large grid of marginally bound, turbulent clouds of 107M⊙ to explore the effect of modeling ingredients on the evolution of the clouds and the star clusters. We find both gas accretion and mergers to be critical processes to form star clusters of masses up to ∼105–106M⊙, while ionizing radiation is the main feedback mechanism regulating the growth of star clusters. The majority of our star clusters assemble their mass in 0.3–2.6 Myr, and the most massive ones take ∼10 Myr. By removing high-density gas by accretion, our sink-based cluster formation prescription allows the newly formed star clusters to inject their stellar feedback in less dense environments. This makes feedback more efficient at ionizing and disrupting the cloud than if we were to use a standard star formation approach, indicating that our numerical method is the missing critical step to model the interplay between star clusters and their host galaxies.

<title>Disk Kinematics at High Redshift: DysmalPy’s Extension to 3D Modeling and Comparison with Different Approaches</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Spatially resolved emission-line kinematics are invaluable for investigating fundamental galaxy properties and have become increasingly accessible for galaxies at z ≳0.5 through sensitive near-infrared imaging spectroscopy and millimeter interferometry. Kinematic modeling is at the core of the analysis and interpretation of such data sets, which at high z present challenges due to the lower signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and resolution compared to the data of local galaxies. We present and test the 3D fitting functionality of DysmalPy, examining how well it recovers the intrinsic disk rotation velocity and velocity dispersion, using a large suite of axisymmetric models, covering a range of galaxy properties and observational parameters typical of z ∼ 1−3 star-forming galaxies. We also compare DysmalPy’s recovery performance to that of two other commonly used codes, GalPak3D and 3DBarolo, which we use in turn to create additional sets of models to benchmark DysmalPy. Over the ranges of S/N, resolution, mass, and velocity dispersion explored, the rotation velocity is accurately recovered by all tools. The velocity dispersion is recovered well at high S/N, but the impact of methodology differences is more apparent. In particular, template differences for parametric tools and S/N sensitivity for the nonparametric tool can lead to differences of up to a factor of 2. Our tests highlight and the importance of deep, high-resolution data and the need for careful consideration of (i) the choice of priors (parametric approaches); and (ii) the masking (all approaches); and (iii), more generally, the evaluating of the suitability of each approach to the specific data at hand. This paper accompanies the public release of DysmalPy.

<title>A Framework to Calibrate a Semianalytic Model of the First Stars and Galaxies to the Renaissance Simulations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad919e</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad919e</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a method that calibrates a semianalytic model to the Renaissance Simulations, a suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations with high-redshift galaxy formation. This approach combines the strengths of semianalytic techniques and hydrodynamical simulations, enabling the extension to larger volumes and lower redshifts that are inaccessible to simulations due to computational expense. Using a sample of Renaissance star formation histories from an average density region of the Universe, we construct a four-parameter prescription for metal-enriched star formation characterized by an initial bursty stage followed by a steady stage where stars are formed at constant efficiencies. Our model also includes a treatment of Pop III star formation where a minimum halo mass and log-normal distribution of stellar mass are adopted to match the numerical simulations. Star formation is generally well reproduced for halos with masses ≲109M⊙. Between 11 < z < 25 our model produces metal-enriched star formation rate densities (SFRDs) that typically agree with Renaissance within a factor of ∼2 for the average density region. Additionally, the total metal-enriched stellar mass only differs from Renaissance by about 10% at z ∼ 11. For regions that are either more overdense or rarefied and not included in the calibration, we produce metal-enriched SFRDs that agree with Renaissance within a factor of ∼2 at high-z but eventually differ by higher factors for later times. This is likely due to environmental dependencies not included in the model. Our star formation prescriptions can easily be adopted in other analytic or semianalytic works to match our calibration to Renaissance.

<title>Evolution of the Accretion Disk and Corona during the Outburst of the Neutron Star Transient MAXI J1807+132</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Low-mass X-ray binaries with a neutron star as the primary object show a complex array of phenomenology during outbursts. The observed variability in X-ray emission primarily arises from changes in the innermost regions of the accretion disk, neutron star surface, and corona. In this work, we present the results of a comprehensive X-ray spectral and timing analysis of the neutron star transient MAXI J1807+132 during its 2023 outburst using data from the NICER observatory. The outburst is marked by a very rapid rise in the count rate by about a factor of 20 in a day. The source undergoes full state transitions and displays the hysteresis effect in the hardness and rms intensity diagrams. Spectral analysis with a three-component model is consistent with disk truncation during the hard states and reaching the last stable orbit during the intermediate and soft states. We discuss the different values of the last stable radius in the context of the possible distance of the source and magnetic field strength. The characteristic frequencies throughout the hard and intermediate states are found to be strongly correlated with the inner radius of the disk. Together with the spectral and fast variability properties, we attempt to trace the evolution of the size of the corona along the outburst. Following the main outburst, the source undergoes a high-amplitude reflare, wherein it shows a complex behavior with relatively high variability (10%), but low hardness.

<title>A Systematic Survey of Moon-forming Giant Impacts. II. Rotating Bodies</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9248</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9248</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In the leading theory of lunar formation, known as the giant impact hypothesis, a collision between two planet-sized objects resulted in a young Earth surrounded by a circumplanetary debris disk from which the Moon later accreted. The range of giant impacts that could conceivably explain the Earth–Moon system is limited by the set of known physical and geochemical constraints. However, while several distinct Moon-forming impact scenarios have been proposed—from small, high-velocity impactors to low-velocity mergers between equal-mass objects—none of these scenarios have been successful at explaining the full set of known constraints, especially without invoking one or more controversial post-impact processes. Allowing for pre-impact rotation of the colliding bodies has been suggested as an avenue that may produce more promising collision outcomes. However, to date, only limited studies of pre-impact rotation have been conducted. Therefore, in this second paper of the series, we focus on pairwise impacts between rotating bodies. Using nonrotating collisions as a baseline, we systematically study the effects of rotation on collision outcomes. We consider nine distinct rotation configurations and a range of rotation rates up to the rotational stability limit. Notably, we identify a population of collisions that can produce low post-impact angular momentum (AM) budgets and massive, iron-poor protolunar disks. Furthermore, even when pre-impact rotation is included, we demonstrate that the canonical Moon-forming impact can only generate sufficiently massive protolunar disks in the presence of excessive post-impact AM budgets; this casts doubt on the canonical impact scenario.

<title>Detection of a Highly Ionized Outflow in the Quasiperiodically Erupting Source GSN 069</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9249</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9249</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Quasiperiodic eruptions (QPEs) are high-amplitude, soft X-ray bursts recurring every few hours, associated with supermassive black holes. Many interpretations for QPEs were proposed since their recent discovery in 2019, including extreme mass ratio inspirals and accretion disk instabilities. But, as of today, their nature still remains debated. We perform the first high-resolution X-ray spectral study of a QPE source using the Reflection Grating Spectrometers' gratings on board XMM-Newton, leveraging nearly 2 Ms of exposure on GSN 069, the first discovered source of this class. We resolve several absorption and emission lines including a strong line pair near the N vii rest-frame energy, resembling the P-Cygni profile. We apply photoionization spectral models and identify the absorption lines as an outflow blueshifted by 1700−2900 km s−1, with a column density of about 1022 cm−2 and an ionization parameter /erg cm s−1) of 3.9−4.6. The emission lines are instead redshifted by up to 2900 km s−1, and likely originate from the same outflow that imprints the absorption features, and covers the full 4π sky from the point of view of GSN 069. The column density and ionization are comparable to the outflows detected in some tidal disruption events, but this outflow is significantly faster and has a strong emission component. The outflow is more highly ionized when the system is in the phase during which QPEs are present, and from the limits, we derive on its location, we conclude that the outflow is connected to the recent complex, transient activity of GSN 069, which began around 2010.

<title>Laboratory Studies on Absolute n-resolved Charge-exchange Cross Sections and Modeling X-Ray Emissions for Ne8+ Colliding with H2 and He</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Charge exchange is a predominant process in inelastic collisions in astronomical plasmas, influencing the charge state balance and leading to X-ray emissions when solar wind ions interact with neutral gas in astrophysical environments. Accurate analysis of these dynamic properties to diagnose the solar wind composition and velocities, as well as the spatial distribution of the heliospheric neutral gas, can be hindered by the limited availability of relevant electron capture studies in the corresponding energy range. The absolute total and -resolved state-selective cross sections of single electron capture have been measured in the collisional energy range from 2.8 to 40 keV u−1, covering velocities corresponding to fast solar wind and coronal mass ejections. In comparison with existing atomic data, we observe good agreement with other results at overlapping energies. Based on the absolute -state electron capture cross sections, the absolute cross sections of photon emissions following charge exchange between Ne8+ and H2, as well as He gas, were determined for the potential applications in high-resolution X-ray spectra studies of solar wind charge exchange. This work serves as a benchmark for validating the theoretical calculations of charge exchange cross sections and astronomical plasma models, providing valuable insights into the investigation of soft X-ray emissions in solar wind plasma environments.

<title>CHANG-ES. XXXV. Cosmic Ray Transport and Magnetic Field Structure of NGC 3556 at 3 GHz</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Radio halos of edge-on galaxies are crucial for investigating cosmic ray propagation and magnetic field structures in galactic environments. We present VLA C-configuration S-band (2–4 GHz) observations of the spiral galaxy NGC 3556, a target from the Continuum Halos in Nearby Galaxies—an EVLA Survey. We estimate the thermal contribution to the radio emission from a combination of the Hα and mid-IR data, and employ rotation measure synthesis to reveal the magnetic field structures. In our data, NGC 3556 exhibits a box-like radio halo extending nearly 7 kpc from the galactic plane. The scale height of the total S-band intensity in the halo is 1.68 ± 0.29 kpc, while that of the nonthermal intensity is 1.93 ± 0.28 kpc. Fitting the data to a 1D cosmic-ray transport model, we find advection to describe the cosmic-ray propagation within the halo better than diffusion, with advection speeds of 245 ± 15 km s−1 and 205 ± 25 km s−1 above and below the disk, respectively. The magnetic field is detected patchily across the galaxy, displaying a toroidal configuration in the rotation measure map. The mean equipartition magnetic field strength is approximately 8.3 μG in the disk and 4.5 μG in the halo. In addition, a bubble-like structure extends nearly 3 kpc into the southern halo, aligned with the polarized intensity and Hα image, suggestive of superwinds generated by recent star formation feedback in the nuclear region.

<title>Irradiated Atmospheres. I. Heating by Vertical-mixing-induced Energy Transport</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Observations have revealed unique temperature profiles in hot Jupiter atmospheres. We propose that the energy transport by vertical mixing could lead to such thermal features. In our new scenario, strong absorbers, TiO, and VO are not necessary. Vertical mixing could be naturally excited by atmospheric circulation or internal gravity wave breaking. We perform radiative transfer calculations by taking into account the vertical-mixing-driven energy transport. The radiative equilibrium is replaced by the radiative-mixing equilibrium. We investigate how the mixing strength, Kzz, affects the atmospheric temperature–pressure profile. Strong mixing can heat the lower atmosphere and cool the upper atmosphere. This effect has important effects on the atmosphere's thermal features that would form without mixing. In certain circumstances, it can induce temperature inversions in scenarios where the temperature monotonically increases with increasing pressure under conditions of lower thermal band opacity. Temperature inversions show up as Kzz increases with altitude due to shear interaction with the convection layer. The atmospheric thermal structure of HD 209458b can be well fitted with Kzz ∝ (P/1 bar)−1/2 cm2 s−1. Our findings suggest vertical mixing promotes temperature inversions and lowers Kzz estimates compared to prior studies. Incorporating chemical species into vertical mixing will significantly affect the thermal profile due to their temperature sensitivity.

<title>The Impact of Void-finding Algorithms on Galaxy Classification</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9585</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We explore how the definition of a void influences the conclusions drawn about the impact of the void environment on galactic properties using two void-finding algorithms in the Void Analysis Software Toolkit: Voronoi Voids (V2), a Python implementation of ZOnes Bordering On Voidness (ZOBOV); and VoidFinder, an algorithm that grows and merges spherical void regions. Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, we find that galaxies found in VoidFinder voids tend to be bluer and fainter and to have higher (specific) star formation rates than galaxies in denser regions. Conversely, galaxies found in V2 voids show less significant differences when compared to galaxies in denser regions, less consistent with the large-scale environmental effects on galaxy properties expected from both simulations and previous observations. These results align with previous simulation results that show V2-identified voids “leak” into the dense walls between voids because their boundaries extend up to the density maxima in the walls. As a result, when using ZOBOV-based void-finders, galaxies likely to be part of wall regions are instead classified as void galaxies, a misclassification that can be critical to our understanding of galaxy evolution.

<title>A High-resolution Simulation of Protoplanetary Disk Turbulence Driven by the Vertical Shear Instability</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90a5</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A high-resolution fourth-order Padé scheme is used to simulate locally isothermal 3D disk turbulence driven by the vertical shear instability (VSI) using 268.4 M points. In the early nonlinear period of axisymmetric VSI, angular momentum transport by vertical jets creates correlated N-shaped radial profiles of perturbation vertical and azimuthal velocity. This implies dominance of positive perturbation vertical vorticity layers and a recently discovered angular momentum staircase with respect to radius (r). These features are present in 3D in a weaker form. The 3D flow consists of vertically and azimuthally coherent turbulent shear layers containing small vortices with all three vorticity components active. Previously observed large persistent vortices in the interior of the domain driven by the Rossby wave instability are absent. We speculate that this is due to a weaker angular momentum staircase in 3D in the present simulations compared to a previous simulation. The turbulent viscosity parameter α(r) increases linearly with r. At intermediate resolution, the value of α(r) at midradius is close to that of a previous simulation. The specific kinetic energy spectrum with respect to radial wavenumber has a power-law region with exponent −1.84, close to the value −2 expected for shear layers. The spectrum with respect to azimuthal wavenumber has a −5/3 region and lacks a −5 region reported in an earlier study. Finally, it is found that axisymmetric VSI has artifacts at late times, including a very strong angular momentum staircase, which in 3D is present weakly in the disk’s upper layers.

<title>Evolutionary Dynamics of Counterhelical Magnetic Flux Ropes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Upon interaction, a pair of magnetic flux ropes can merge to form a new pair, each consisting of opposite helicity along their axis. Magnetic helicity along such new structures may annihilate and release the energy of the azimuthal magnetic field. In this study, we model the deformation dynamics of such structures within the solar wind at 1 au. The perturbation front of deformation propagates along the rope axis at approximately the Alfvén speed. However, the process of annihilating 90% of the azimuthal components is much slower and is affected by the screw pitch of the magnetic field. Such a deformation process causes the plasma in the transition region between the two opposite chiralities to spin about the rope axis. The resulting plasma heating is discussed accordingly. Our results provide insights for estimating the lifetimes of such flux ropes, facilitating observational efforts to identify them. This process may also apply to the behavior of magnetic flux ropes in other space and astronomical plasma environments.

<title>Expanding the Ultracompacts: Gravitational-wave-driven Mass Transfer in the Shortest-period Binaries with Accretion Disks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the discovery of three ultracompact binary white dwarf systems hosting accretion disks, with orbital periods of 7.95, 8.68, and 13.15 minutes. This significantly augments the population of mass-transferring binaries at the shortest periods, and provides the first evidence that accretors in ultracompacts can be dense enough to host accretion disks even below 10 minutes (where previously only direct-impact accretors were known). In the two shortest-period systems, we measured changes in the orbital periods driven by the combined effect of gravitational-wave emission and mass transfer. We find is negative in one case, and positive in the other. This is only the second system measured with a positive , and it is the most compact binary known that has survived a period minimum. Using these systems as examples, we show how the measurement of is a powerful tool in constraining the physical properties of binaries, e.g., the mass and mass–radius relation of the donor stars. We find that the chirp masses of ultracompact binaries at these periods seem to cluster around , perhaps suggesting a common origin for these systems or a selection bias in electromagnetic discoveries. Our new systems are among the highest-amplitude known gravitational-wave sources in the millihertz regime, providing an exquisite opportunity for multimessenger study with future space-based observatories such as LISA and TianQin. We discuss how such systems provide fascinating laboratories to study the unique regime where the accretion process is mediated by gravitational waves.

<title>Switchback Patches Evolve into Microstreams via Magnetic Relaxation</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad94da</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Switchbacks, defined as Alfvénic reversals in magnetic field polarity, can dissipate their magnetic energy with heliocentric distance. To further investigate this, two distinct solar wind parcels tracing back to a similar solar source region were examined during a radial alignment between Parker Solar Probe (@25.8RS) and Solar Orbiter (@152RS). The one caveat was that the two probes were located on opposite sides of the heliospheric current sheet during the alignment. The two parcels contained a multitude of switchbacks—the parcel closer to the Sun was characterized as a switchback patch (SBP), where background proton velocity (vp) is comparable to the pristine solar wind (vsw), while the parcel farther from the Sun showed characteristics attributable to a microstream (MS; vp > vsw). It was found that (1) MS contains, on average, 30% fewer switchbacks than SBP, and (2) dynamic and thermal pressures decreased by up to 20% across switchback boundaries in SBP and relatively unchanged in MS. Magnetic relaxation can explain the lower number of switchbacks in MS compared to SBP. Switchback relaxation inside SBP can, in turn, accelerate plasma inside SBP over time and heliocentric distance, thus resulting in vp > vsw in MS. Therefore, it is hypothesized that magnetic relaxation of switchbacks may cause SBPs to evolve into MSs over time and heliocentric distance.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent multiwavelength observations of gamma-ray burst afterglows observed in the TeV energy range challenge the simplest synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) interpretation of this emission and are consistent with a single power-law component spanning over 8 orders of magnitude in energy. To interpret this generic behavior in the single-zone approximation without adding further free parameters, we perform an exhaustive parameter space study using the public, time-dependent, multimessenger transport software AM3. This description accounts for the radiation from nonthermal protons and the leptohadronic cascade induced by pp and pγ interactions. We summarise the main scenarios that we have found (SSC, Extended-syn, Proton-syn, pp-cascade, and pγ-cascade) and discuss their advantages and limitations. We find that possible high-density environments, as may be typical for surrounding molecular cloud material, offer an alternative explanation for producing flat hard (source) spectra up to and beyond energies of 10 TeV.

<title>Are Long Gamma-Ray Bursts Progenitors to Merging Binary Black Holes?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The distribution of delay times between the formation of binary black hole (BBH) progenitors and their gravitational-wave (GW) merger provides important clues about their unknown formation histories. When inferring the delay time distribution, it is typically assumed that BBH progenitor formation traces the star formation rate (SFR). In this work, we consider the rate of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) instead of the SFR. LGRBs are thought to correspond to the formation of (possibly spinning) black holes, and may therefore be related to the BBH progenitor population. By comparing the redshift evolution of the LGRB rate as inferred by G. Ghirlanda & R. Salvaterra and the BBH merger rate inferred by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observations, we find that the delay time distribution between LGRBs and BBH mergers is well described by a power law with minimum delay time 10 Myr and slope (90% credibility). This matches theoretical expectations for the BBH delay time distribution, which in turn lends support to the hypothesis that LGRBs trace BBH progenitor formation. However, comparing the absolute rates of these two populations, we find that at most of LGRBs may evolve into merging BBHs. We also consider the possibility that LGRBs only produce BBH systems with large aligned spins (with effective inspiral spin χeff > 0.2). In this case, we find and the delay time distribution favors the steepest power-law slopes we consider (α = −2). We argue that asynchronous observations of LGRBs and GWs provide a powerful multimessenger probe of black hole life cycles across cosmic history.

<title>Icarus Revisited: An Ancient, Metal-poor Accreted Stellar Stream in the Disk of the Milky Way</title>

The search for accreted satellites in the Galactic disk is a challenging task, to which Gaia plays a crucial role in synergy with ground-based spectroscopic surveys. In 2021, P. Re Fiorentin et al. discovered five substructures with disk kinematics including Icarus. To gain more insight into the origin of Icarus as a remnant of a dwarf galaxy rather than a signature of secular processes of disk formation, we complement astrometric Gaia DR3 data with spectroscopy from APOGEE DR17 and GALAH DR3, and explore the chemodynamical distributions within 3 kpc of the Sun. We select 622 stars in the accreted/unevolved regions of [Mg/Mn]–[Al/Fe] and [Mg/Fe]–[Fe/H], where we identify 81 and 376 stars with −2 < [Fe/H] < −0.7 belonging to Icarus and Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), respectively. The revised properties of Icarus are: 〈V + VLSR〉 ≃ 171 km s−1, σV ≃ 37 km s−1, 〈e〉 ≃ 0.36, 〈[Fe/H]〉 ≃ −1.35, 〈[Mg/Fe]〉 ≃ +0.27, 〈[Al/Fe]〉 ≃ −0.13, and 〈[Mn/Fe]〉 ≃ −0.39. From the color–magnitude diagram of its members, Icarus appears older than 12 Gyr. Such age and dynamical properties are reminiscent of the metal-weak thick disk. However, detailed chemical analysis in the diagnostic spaces [Ni/Fe]–[(C+N)/O], [Y/Eu]–[Fe/H], [Eu/Mg]–[Fe/H], [Ba/Y]–[Fe/H], and [Ba/Mg]–[Mg/H] evidences that Icarus and GSE occupy the accreted region, well separated from the bulk of in situ disk stars. Updated comparisons with N-body simulations confirm that Icarus’s stars are consistent with the debris of a dwarf galaxy with a stellar mass of ∼109M☉ accreted onto a primordial disk on an initial prograde low-inclination orbit.

<title>Gleeok’s Fire-breathing: Triple Flares of AT 2021aeuk within Five Years from the Active Galaxy SDSS J161259.83+421940.3</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a noteworthy transient AT 2021aeuk exhibiting three distinct optical flares between 2018 and 2023. It is hosted in a radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy, with an optical image showing a minor tidal morphology and a red mid-infrared color (W1 − W2 = 1.1). Flares II and III exhibit rapid rises, and long-term decays (≳1000 days) with recurring after-peak bumps. The g − r color after subtracting the reference magnitude exhibited a rapid drop and recovery during Flare II, followed by a minor after-peak evolution in blue colors. We applied a canonical tidal disruption event (TDE) fitting on the light curves, which gives a decay index p of for Flare II and for Flare III. The blackbody fitting shows lower temperatures (∼103.8 K) with minor after-peak evolution. The blackbody radius (≳1016 cm) and luminosity (∼1045 erg s−1) are larger than the typical TDE sample’s. The time lag (in rest frame) between the ZTF g and r bands ( days) significantly exceeds the prediction from the standard accretion disk. Pre-burst spectra reveal prominent Bowen fluorescence lines, indicating a vigorous or potentially long-lasting process that enriches the local metallicity. Additionally, we derived black hole masses of and using Hβ and Hα emission lines. The variation and recurring features of AT 2021aeuk are not likely induced by the radio-beaming effect or Type II superluminous supernova; however, we cannot rule out the possibility of TDE or enhanced active galactic nuclei accretion process. The unusually high occurrence of three flares within 5 yr may also induced by the complex local environment.

<title>Imaging of the Vega Debris System Using JWST/MIRI</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8cde</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8cde</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present images of the Vega planetary debris disk obtained at 15.5, 23, and 25.5 μm with the Mid-Infrared Instrument on JWST. The debris system is remarkably symmetric, smooth, and centered accurately on the star. There is a broad Kuiper-belt-analog ring at ∼80–170 au that coincides with the planetesimal belt detected with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at 1.34 mm. The interior of the broad belt is filled with warm debris that shines most efficiently at mid-infrared, along with a shallow flux dip/gap at 60 au from the star. These qualitative characteristics argue against any Saturn-mass planets orbiting the star outside of about 10 au, assuming the unseen planet would be embedded in the very broad planetesimal disk from a few to hundreds of astronomical units. We find that the distribution of dust detected interior to the broad outer belt is consistent with grains being dragged inward by the Poynting–Robertson effect. Under the drag-dominated disk assumption, tighter constraints can be derived for planets in specific locations; for example, any planet shepherding the inner edge of the outer belt is likely to be less than six Earth masses. The disk surface brightness profile along with the available infrared photometry suggest a disk inner edge near ∼3−5 au, disconnected from the sub-astronomical-unit region that gives rise to the hot near-infrared excess. The gap between the hot, sub-astronomical-unit zone and the inner edge of the warm debris might be shepherded by a modest-mass, Neptune-size planet.

<title>Interpolation Techniques for Reconstructing Galactic Faraday Rotation</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8ddf</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8ddf</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The line-of-sight structure of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) can be studied using Faraday rotation measure (RM) grids. We analyze how the choice of interpolation kernel can affect the accuracy and reliability of reconstructed RM maps. We test the following kernels: inverse distance weighting (IDW), natural neighbor interpolation (NNI), inverse multiquadric interpolation (IM), thin-plate spline interpolation (TPS), and a Bayesian rotation measure sky (BRMS); all techniques were tested on two simulated Galactic foreground RMs (one assuming the GMF has patchy structures and the other assuming it has filamentary structures) using magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Both foregrounds were sampled to form RM grids with densities of ∼40 sources deg−2 and area ∼144 deg2. The techniques were tested on data sets with different noise levels and Gaussian random extragalactic RM contributions. The data set that most closely emulates expected data from current surveys, such as the POlarization Sky Survey of the Universe’s Magnetism (POSSUM), had extragalactic contributions and a noise standard deviation of ∼1.5 rad m−2. For this data set, the accuracy of the techniques for the patchy structures is ranked from best to worst as BRMS, NNI, TPS, IDW, and IM; in the filamentary simulated foreground, the ordering is BRMS, NNI, TPS, and IDW. IDW is the most computationally expensive technique, while TPS and IM are the least expensive. BRMS and NNI have the same, intermediate computational cost. This analysis lays the groundwork for Galactic RM studies with large radio polarization sky surveys, such as POSSUM.

<title>Deep Chandra Observations of NGC 5728. III. Probing the High-resolution X-Ray Morphology and Multiphase Interstellar Medium Interactions in the Circumnuclear Region</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a detailed imaging analysis of 260 ks of subarcsecond resolution Chandra (ACIS-S) observations of the nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 5728. Our study focuses on the bright and diffuse soft X-ray emission within the galaxy's inner ∼1 kpc. By comparing the X-ray emission across different energy bands, we identify localized variations in the absorbing column and emission processes. We observe more X-ray absorption in the direction perpendicular to the bicone, which is co-located with an inner warped CO disk in the galaxy. The innermost region, which shows the strongest excess of hard X-ray emission, is spatially coincident with the CO (2–1) emission from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and dusty spirals we find in a Hubble Space Telescope V − H color map. We detect soft extended emission associated with the circumnuclear star-forming ring at ∼1 kpc, suggestive of hot gas with kT = 0.44 keV. We derive measurements for the hot gas mass, M = 7.9 × 105M⊙, pressure, p = 2.0 × 10−10 dyne cm−2, and cooling times, τc = 193.2 Myr. In the vicinity of the star-forming ring, we detect two X-ray point sources, with soft X-ray spectra, and 0.3–7 keV luminosities L ∼ 8 × 1038 erg s−1. These properties suggest X-ray binaries.

<title>Cloud Crushing and Dissipation of Uniformly Driven Adiabatic Turbulence in Circumgalactic Media</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is responsive to kinetic disruptions generated by nearby astrophysical events. In this work, we study the saturation and dissipation of turbulent hydrodynamics within the CGM through an extensive array of 252 numerical simulations with proper cooling mechanisms and a large parameter space spanning average gas density, metallicity, and turbulence driving strength. A dichotomy emerges in the dynamics dissipation behaviors upon turbulence driving turnoff. Hot and subsonic disturbances are characterized by weak compression and slow dissipation, while warm and supersonic turbulences are marked by significant compression shocks and subsequent rapid cooling. In the supersonic cases, the kinetic energy decay is divided into a rate-limiting phase of shock dissipation and a comparatively swift phase of thermal dissipation, predominantly occurring within the overdense regions. Dense clouds are crushed on relatively brief timescales of ∼30–100 Myr, depending on turbulence driving strength but independent from average gas density. This independence is in spite of the complex interplay between the kinetics and thermodynamics of dissipation. The brevity of such timescales relative to typical dynamical timescales within the CGM suggests turbulent clouds must be cotemporal with turbulence driving sources such as cool accretion flows or feedback from the interstellar medium. Quantitative results from this work contribute a novel data set of dissipation timescales that incorporates thermodynamics and radiative cooling in an area of study typically focused on kinematics, which may serve as a valuable asset for forthcoming simulations that aim to explore gas dynamics on galactic and cosmological scales.

<title>Separating Repeating Fast Radio Bursts Using the Minimum Spanning Tree as an Unsupervised Methodology</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) represent one of the most intriguing phenomena in modern astrophysics. However, their classification into repeaters and nonrepeaters is challenging. Here, we present the application of the graph theory minimum spanning tree (MST) methodology as an unsupervised classifier of repeater and nonrepeater FRBs. By constructing MSTs based on various combinations of variables, we identify those that lead to MSTs that exhibit a localized high density of repeaters at each side of the node with the largest betweenness centrality. Comparing the separation power of this methodology against known machine learning methods, and with the random expectation results, we assess the efficiency of the MST-based approach to unravel the physical implications behind the graph pattern. We finally propose a list of potential repeater candidates derived from the analysis using the MST.

<title>New Radio Observations of the Supernova Remnant CTA 1</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90bb</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present new radio images of the supernova remnant (SNR) CTA 1 at 1420 and 408 MHz, and in the 21 cm line of H i observed with the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory Synthesis Telescope and at 1420 MHz observed with the Effelsberg 100 m telescope. We confirm previously described continuum features and elaborate further on filamentary features identified using the high-resolution (1′) maps from these new observations. We investigate the abrupt change in sign of rotation measure (RM) across the SNR, using the linear polarization observations in the four bands around 1420 MHz. Following X. H. Sun et al.’s (2011) investigation, we both confirm that the distribution of signs of the RMs for extragalactic sources in the area appears to match that of the shell, as well as combine the data from the four bands to estimate the relative depolarization and the intrinsic rotation measure of the SNR. We do not conclusively reject X. H. Sun et al.’s (2011) claim of a Faraday screen in the foreground causing the distribution of RMs that we observe; however, we do suggest an alternative explanation of a swept-up stellar wind from the progenitor star with a toroidal magnetic field. Finally, we expand on the analysis of the H i observations by applying the Rolling Hough Transform to isolate filamentary structure and better identify H i emission with the SNR. Further constraining the H i velocity channels associated with CTA 1, we use more recent Galactic rotation curves to calculate an updated kinematic distance of 1.09 ± 0.2 kpc.

<title>Rotational Velocities and Radii Estimates of Low-mass Pre-main-sequence Stars in NGC 2264</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Investigating the angular momentum evolution of pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars provides important insight into the interactions between Sun-like stars and their protoplanetary disks, and the timescales that govern disk dissipation and planet formation. We present projected rotational velocities (v sin i values) of 254 T Tauri stars (TTSs) in the ∼3 Myr old open cluster NGC 2264, measured using high-dispersion spectra from the WIYN 3.5 m telescope’s Hydra instrument. We combine these with literature values of temperature, rotation period, luminosity, disk classification, and binarity. We find some evidence that weak-lined TTSs may rotate faster than their classical TTS counterparts and that stars in binary systems may rotate faster than single stars. We also combine our v sin i measurements with rotation period to estimate the projected stellar radii of our sample stars, and then use a maximum likelihood modeling technique to compare our radii estimates to predicted values from stellar evolution models. We find that starspot-free models tend to underestimate the radii of the PMS stars at the age of the cluster, while models that incorporate starspots are more successful. We also observe a mass dependence in the degree of radius inflation, which may be a result of differences in the birth-line location on the HR diagram. Our study of NGC 2264 serves as a pilot study for analysis methods to be applied to four other clusters ranging in age from 1−14 Myr, which is the timescale over which protoplanetary disks dissipate and planetary systems begin to form.

<title>Metal-strong Inflows at the Outer-galactic-scale of a Quasar</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present an analysis of the absorption-line system in the Very Large Telescope/Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph spectrum at a redshift of za = 3.1448 associated with the quasar SDSS J122040.23+092326.96, whose systematic redshift is ze = 3.1380 ± 0.0007, measured from the Hβ+[O iii] emission lines in our newly acquired NIR P200/TripleSpec data. This absorbing system, detected in numerous absorption lines, including the N v, N iii, C iv, C iii, Si iv, Si iii, and H i Lyman series, can be resolved into seven kinematic components with redshifted velocities ranging from 200 to 900 km s−1. The high-ionization N v doublet detected and the rather narrow Lyman series measured (b ≈ 14 km s−1) suggest that the absorption gas is photoionized, possibly by the quasar. A low density is inferred by the fact that N iiiλ989.80 is significantly detected while N iii*λ991.57 ( ) is undetectably weak. A firm lower limit of a solar value to the abundance of the gas can be set based on the measurements of Si iv and H i column densities, as first proposed by F. Hamann. Detailed photoionization simulations indicate that T1, and possibly the absorber as a whole, has metallicities of Z ∼ 1.5 − 6.0 Z☉, and is located at ∼15 kpc from the quasar nucleus. The metal-strong absorption inflows at the outskirt of the quasar host galaxy most likely originated in situ and were driven by stellar processes, such as stellar winds and/or supernova explosions. Such a relatively rare system may hold important clues to understanding the baryonic cycling of galaxies, and more cases could be picked out using relatively strong Si iv and weak Lyman absorption lines.

<title>Binary Stars Approaching Supermassive Black Holes: Tidal Breakup, Double Stellar Disruptions, and Stellar Collision</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad93a6</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In galactic centers, stars and binaries can be injected into low-angular-momentum orbits, resulting in close encounters with the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). Previous works have shown that under different conditions, such close encounters can lead to the breakup of the binary, disruptions of both stars, and collision between the stars. We use three-body scattering experiments to characterize these different outcomes for a range of system parameters, such as βb, the ratio of the binary tidal radius to the pericenter distance rp to the SMBH, and the compactness of the binary. We focus on stellar collisions, which occur for a range of βbs, with a few to tens of percent probabilities (depending on the compactness of the binary). In gentle encounters (βb ≲ 1), stellar collisions occur after the pericenter passage, and the merger remnants are typically ejected from the SMBH at a small velocity. In deep encounters (βb ≳ 1), collisions occur near the pericenter, with the impact velocity a few times the escape velocity of the star, and the merger remnants are typically bound to the SMBH. We suggest that stellar collisions induced by binary–SMBH encounters may produce exotic stars in galactic centers, trigger accretion flares onto the SMBH due to the mass loss, and result in bound merger remnants causing repeated partial tidal disruption events.

<title>Solar Wind–Magnetosphere Coupling by the Kelvin–Helmholtz Instability at Mercury</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad944b</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (KHI) has been considered important in the energy transfer and momentum coupling between the solar wind and planetary magnetospheres. To explore this issue, we employ a two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation to study the nonlinear evolution of the KHI at Mercury’s magnetopause using the parameters derived from a global hybrid simulation of MESSENGER’s first flyby of Mercury. Due to the absence of comprehensive plasma observations of Mercury’s magnetosphere, two scenarios are considered: one with a heavily loaded magnetosphere and the other with a weakly loaded magnetosphere, to demonstrate the development of the KHI under distinct levels of magnetospheric plasma density. Our results indicate that the KHI with a heavily loaded magnetosphere leads to a significantly more turbulent magnetopause and grows into the nonlinear fast-mode plane waves expanding away from the magnetopause. The momentum and energy flux quantified from our simulations reveal that the KHI with a heavily loaded magnetosphere can efficiently transport momentum and energy away from the magnetopause in the presence of the fast-mode plane waves. In the cases with a heavily loaded magnetosphere, observed in the inner magnetosphere, the momentum flux can reach 10−3 nPa, i.e., about 0.5% of the initial solar-wind dynamic pressure; the energy flux can be and the energy density is about 1.5%–3.0% of the initial solar-wind energy. In the cases with a very thin magnetosphere, observed away from the magnetopause, the momentum flux is negligible and the energy flux is smaller without the presence of the fast-mode plane waves in the magnetosphere.

<title>Signatures of Massive Black Hole Merger Host Galaxies from Cosmological Simulations. II. Unique Stellar Kinematics in Integral Field Unit Spectroscopy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Secure methods for identifying the host galaxies of individual massive black hole (MBH) binaries and mergers detected by gravitational-wave experiments such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna and pulsar timing arrays are currently lacking, but will be critical to a variety of science goals. Recently, in Bardati et al., we used the Romulus25 cosmological simulation to show that MBH merger host galaxies have unique morphologies in imaging, due to their stronger bulges. Here, we use the same sample of simulated MBH merger host galaxies to investigate their stellar kinematics, as probed by optical integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy. We perform stellar population synthesis and dust radiative transfer to generate synthetic 3D optical spectral data cubes of each simulated galaxy, and produce mock stellar kinematic maps. Based on a linear discriminant analysis of a combination of kinematic parameters derived from these maps, we show that this approach can identify MBH binary and merger host galaxies with accuracies that increase with chirp mass and mass ratio. For mergers with high chirp masses (≳108.2M⊙) and high mass ratios (≳0.5), the accuracies reach ≳85%, and their host galaxies are uniquely characterized by slower rotation and stronger stellar kinematic misalignments. These kinematic properties are commonly associated with massive early-type galaxies that have experienced major mergers, and naturally act as signposts for MBH binaries and mergers with high chirp masses and mass ratios. These results suggest that IFU spectroscopy should also play a role in telescope follow-up of future MBH binaries and mergers detected in gravitational waves.

<title>COSMOS2020: Disentangling the Role of Mass and Environment in Star Formation Activity of Galaxies at 0.4 < z < 4</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The role of internal and environmental factors in the star formation activity of galaxies is still a matter of debate, in particular at higher redshifts. Leveraging the most recent release of the COSMOS catalog, COSMOS2020, as well as density measurements from our previous study, we disentangle the impact of environment and stellar mass on the star formation rate (SFR) and specific SFR (sSFR) of a sample of ∼210,000 galaxies within a redshift range of 0.4 < z < 4, and present our findings in three cosmic epochs: (1) out to z ∼ 1, the average SFR and sSFR decline in extremely dense environments and at the high-mass end of the distribution, which is mostly due to the presence of the massive quiescent population; (2) at 1 < z < 2, the environmental dependence diminishes, while mass is still the dominant factor in star formation activity; and (3) beyond z ∼ 2, our sample is dominated by star-forming galaxies and we observe a reversal of the trends seen in the local Universe—the average SFR increases with increasing environmental density. Our analysis shows that both environmental and mass quenching efficiencies increase with stellar mass at all redshifts, with mass being the dominant quenching factor in massive galaxies compared to environmental effects. At 2 < z < 4, negative values of environmental quenching efficiency suggest that the fraction of star-forming galaxies in dense environments exceeds that in less-dense regions, likely due to the greater availability of cold gas, higher merger rates, and tidal effects that trigger star formation activity.

<title>The Decline and Fall of ROME. V. A Preliminary Search for Star-disrupted Planet Interactions and Coronal Activity at 5 GHz among White Dwarfs within 25 pc</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The recent discovery of planetesimals orbiting white dwarfs has renewed interest in the final chapters of the evolution of planetary systems. Although observational and theoretical studies have examined the dynamical evolution of these systems, studies of their magnetic star–planet interactions, as powered by unipolar induction, have thus far only been assessed theoretically. This fifth paper of the Radio Observations of Magnetized Exoplanets series presents the results of a targeted minisurvey of nine white dwarfs within 25 pc without known stellar mass companions in search of radio emissions generated by magnetic interactions between white dwarfs and their planetary remnants. This ∼5 GHz Arecibo radio telescope survey achieved mJy-level sensitivity over <1 s integration times. Although no exoplanet-induced stellar radio flares were detected, this is the first survey to search for magnetic star–planet interactions between white dwarfs and planetary companions, cores, or disrupted planetesimals. It is also the most extensive and sensitive radio survey for intrinsic coronal emissions from apparently isolated white dwarfs. The study of radio emissions from white dwarf systems may present a new means to detect and measure DC and DQ magnetic fields, search for white dwarf coronae, characterize the density and spatial distribution of white dwarf magnetospheric plasma, characterize the dynamical and electrical properties of planetary cores, and offer new constraints on the modeling of double-degenerate merger events.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Electron cyclotron maser (ECM) emission is an important coherent emission mechanism for the direct amplification of electromagnetic waves by nonthermal electrons in a magnetized plasma. This paper will report on our recent study on ECM emission by fast electron beams with moderately relativistic energy. The results show that, similar to the spontaneous emission by the magnetic cyclotron motion of energetic electrons in a magnetic field, the coherent emission also exhibits the characteristic of a gradual transition from harmonic emission to continuous emission as the energy of the energetic electrons increases from subrelativistic to relativistic. The effects of the characteristic beam electrons energy (Ec) and the plasma-to-cyclotron frequency ratio (ωpe/ωce) on the growth rate, the peak-value frequency, and the spectral width are discussed further. These results are helpful for us to understand phenomena associated with astrophysical radio bursts.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Several filament eruptions with pronounced writhing of the axis of the structure are analyzed. Initially, smooth arches of eruptive filaments are transformed into large-scale helical structures with at least one complete turn due to the development of kink instability. However, the initiation of the eruptions seems to be caused not by the kink instability but by catastrophic loss of equilibrium or torus instability. Calculations of the decay index of the coronal potential magnetic field indicate that the studied filaments began to rise rapidly at heights where the decay index was close to unity, the threshold for the catastrophic loss of equilibrium of straight flux ropes. Although it is often assumed that the kink instability precedes the subsequent torus instability leading to a full eruption, these examples testify to the possibility of the reverse order of the eruption development.

<title>A Search Using GEO600 for Gravitational Waves Coincident with Fast Radio Bursts from SGR 1935+2154</title>

The magnetar SGR 1935+2154 is the only known Galactic source of fast radio bursts (FRBs). FRBs from SGR 1935+2154 were first detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME)/FRB and the Survey for Transient Astronomical Radio Emission 2 in 2020 April, after the conclusion of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA Collaborations’ O3 observing run. Here, we analyze four periods of gravitational wave (GW) data from the GEO600 detector coincident with four periods of FRB activity detected by CHIME/FRB, as well as X-ray glitches and X-ray bursts detected by NICER and NuSTAR close to the time of one of the FRBs. We do not detect any significant GW emission from any of the events. Instead, using a short-duration GW search (for bursts ≤1 s) we derive 50% (90%) upper limits of 1048 (1049) erg for GWs at 300 Hz and 1049 (1050) erg at 2 kHz, and constrain the GW-to-radio energy ratio to ≤1014−1016. We also derive upper limits from a long-duration search for bursts with durations between 1 and 10 s. These represent the strictest upper limits on concurrent GW emission from FRBs.

<title>SN2023fyq: A Type Ibn Supernova with Long-standing Precursor Activity Due to Binary Interaction</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8de6</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8de6</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2023fyq, a Type Ibn supernova (SN) in the nearby galaxy NGC 4388 (D ≃ 18 Mpc). In addition, we trace the 3 yr long precursor emission at the position of SN 2023fyq using data from DLT40, ATLAS, Zwicky Transient Facility, ASAS-SN, Swift, and amateur astronomer Koichi Itagaki. The double-peaked postexplosion light curve reaches a luminosity of ∼1043 erg s−1. The strong intermediate-width He lines observed in the nebular spectrum imply the interaction is still active at late phases. We found that the precursor activity in SN 2023fyq is best explained by the mass transfer in a binary system involving a low-mass He star and a compact companion. An equatorial disk is likely formed in this process (∼0.6M⊙), and the interaction of SN ejecta with this disk powers the second peak of the SN. The early SN light curve reveals the presence of dense extended material (∼0.3M⊙) at ∼3000R⊙ ejected weeks before the SN explosion, likely due to final-stage core silicon burning or runaway mass transfer resulting from binary orbital shrinking, leading to rapid-rising precursor emission within ∼30 days prior to explosion. The final explosion could be triggered either by the core collapse of the He star or by the merger of the He star with a compact object. SN 2023fyq, along with SN 2018gjx and SN 2015G, forms a unique class of Type Ibn SNe, which originate in binary systems and are likely to exhibit detectable long-lasting pre-explosion outbursts with magnitudes ranging from −10 to −13.

<title>The Redshift of GRB 190829A/SN 2019oyw: A Case Study of GRB-SN Evolution</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8dd8</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8dd8</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The nearby long gamma-ray burst (GRB) 190829A was observed using the Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3/infrared grisms about four weeks to 500 days after the burst. We find the spectral features of its associated supernova, SN 2019oyw, are redshifted by several thousand km s−1 compared to the redshift of the large spiral galaxy on which it is superposed. This velocity offset is seen in several features but most clearly in Ca ii near-infrared triplet λλ8498, 8542, 8662 (CaIR3). We also analyze Very Large Telescope/FOcal Reducer and low dispersion Spectrograph and X-shooter spectra of the supernova (SN) and find strong evolution with time of its P-Cygni features of CaIR3 from the blue to the red. However, comparison with a large sample of Type Ic-BL and Ic SNe shows no other object with the CaIR3 line as red as that of SN 2019oyw were it at the z = 0.0785 redshift of the disk galaxy. This implies that SN 2019oyw is either a highly unusual SN or is moving rapidly with respect to its apparent host. Indeed, using CaIR3 we find the redshift of SN 2019oyw is 0.0944 ≤ z ≤ 0.1156. The GRB-SN is superposed on a particularly dusty region of the massive spiral galaxy; therefore, while we see no sign of a small host galaxy behind the spiral, it could be obscured. Our work provides a surprising result on the origins of GRB 190829A, as well as insights into the time evolution of GRB-SNe spectra and a method for directly determining the redshift of a GRB-SN using the evolution of strong spectral features such as CaIR3.

<title>Detection of the Temperature Dependence of the White Dwarf Mass–Radius Relation with Gravitational Redshifts</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8ddc</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Models predict that the well-studied mass–radius relation of white dwarf stars depends on the temperature of the star, with hotter white dwarfs having larger masses at a given radius than cooler stars. In this paper, we use a catalog of 26,041 DA white dwarfs observed in Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Releases 1–19. We measure the radial velocity, effective temperature, surface gravity, and radius for each object. By binning this catalog in radius or surface gravity, we average out the random motion component of the radial velocities for nearby white dwarfs to isolate the gravitational redshifts for these objects and use them to directly measure the mass–radius relation. For gravitational redshifts measured from binning in either radius or surface gravity, we find strong evidence for a temperature-dependent mass–radius relation, with warmer white dwarfs consistently having greater gravitational redshifts than cool objects at a fixed radius or surface gravity. For warm white dwarfs, we find that their mean radius is larger and mean surface gravity is smaller than those of cool white dwarfs at 5.2σ and 6.0σ significance, respectively. Selecting white dwarfs with similar radii or surface gravities, the significance of the difference in mean gravitational redshifts between the warm and cool samples is >6.1σ and >3.6σ for measurements binned in radius and surface gravity, respectively, in the direction predicted by theory. This is an improvement over previous implicit detections, and our technique can be expanded to precisely test the white dwarf mass–radius relation with future surveys.

<title>Mapping the Inner 0.1 pc of a Supermassive Black Hole Environment with the Tidal Disruption Event and Extreme Coronal-line Emitter AT 2022upj</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Extreme coronal-line emitters (ECLEs) are objects showing transient high-ionization lines in the centers of galaxies. They have been attributed to echoes of high-energy flares of ionizing radiation, such as those produced by tidal disruption events (TDEs), but have only recently been observed within hundreds of days after an optical transient was detected. AT 2022upj is a nuclear UV–optical flare at z = 0.054, with spectra showing [Fe x] λ6375 and [Fe xiv] λ5303 during the optical peak, the earliest presence of extreme coronal lines during an ongoing transient. AT 2022upj is also the second ever ECLE (and the first with a concurrent flare) to show broad He iiλ4686 emission, a key signature of optical/UV TDEs. We also detect X-ray emission during the optical transient phase, which may be related to the source of ionizing photons for the extreme coronal lines. Finally, we analyze the spectroscopic evolution of each emission line and find that [Fe x] and [Fe xiv] weaken within 400 days of the optical peak, while [Fe vii] λ5720, [Fe vii] λ6087, and [O iii] λλ4959,5007 emerge over the same period. The velocities of the iron lines indicate circumnuclear gas within 0.1 pc of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH), while a dust echo inferred from NEOWISE data indicates that circumnuclear dust lies a minimum of 0.4 pc away, providing evidence of stratified material around an SMBH. AT 2022upj is thus the first confirmed ECLE–TDE with clear signatures of both classes and with spectroscopic evolution on a ∼year-long timescale. This event helps unveil the impacts of highly energetic flares such as TDEs on the complex environments around SMBHs.

<title>Enhanced Peak and Extended Cooling of the Extreme-ultraviolet Late Phase in a Confined Solar Flare</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8ba3</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8ba3</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present observations and analysis of an X1.8 noneruptive solar flare on 2012 October 23, which is characterized by an extremely large late-phase peak seen in the warm coronal extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) emissions (∼3 MK), with the peak intensity over 1.4 times that of the main flare peak. The flare is driven by a failed eruption of a magnetic flux rope, whose strong squeeze force acting on the overlying magnetic structures gives rise to an intense early heating of the late-phase loops. Based on differential emission measure analysis, it is found that the late-phase loops experience a “longer-than-expected” cooling, without the presence of any obvious additional heating, while their volume emission measure maintains a plateau for a long time before turning into an evident decay. Without the need for an additional heating, we propose that the special thermodynamic evolution of the late-phase loops revealed in this flare might arise from loop cross-sectional expansions with height, which are evidenced by both direct measurements from EUV images and by magnetic field extrapolation. By blocking the losses of both heat flux and mass from the corona, such an upward cross-sectional expansion not only elongates the loop-cooling time, but also more effectively sustains the loop density, therefore leading to a later-than-expected occurrence of the warm coronal late phase in combination with a sufficiently high late-phase peak. We further verify such a scenario by analytically solving the cooling process of a late-phase loop characterized by a variable cross section.

<title>A Precursor to Solar Prominence Eruptions: Detection and Analysis of EUV Prominence Oscillations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The eruption of prominences can have a significant influence on the solar–terrestrial environment. However, accurately predicting these eruptions remains a challenge. We apply automated detection methods for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) prominences observed by the twin spacecraft from the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) mission and the Solar Dynamics Observatory near Earth. We study an event, during 2011 March, when each STEREO spacecraft is in quadrature with respect to the Earth. For two time ranges, we obtain longitudinal height profiles as a function of time. We also track the corresponding EUV filaments across the solar disk, which reveal the emergence of ultra-long-period oscillations in the EUV filament channels. Our analysis shows a correlation between the prominence’s increasing height and the oscillation periods, suggesting a potential link to the subsequent eruption observed by the STEREO spacecraft off-limb. These findings offer new insights into prominence dynamics and may pave the way for improved eruption prediction.

<title>The Milky Way’s Rowdy Neighbors: The Effects of the Large Magellanic Cloud and Sagittarius Dwarf on the Milky Way Disk</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Milky Way (MW) is a barred spiral galaxy shaped by tidal interactions with its satellites. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr) are the dominant influences at the present day. This paper presents a suite of four 109 particle N-body simulations, illustrating the response of the stellar disk of the MW to the close approach of the LMC and the merger of Sgr into the MW. The suite is intended to provide a resource for others to study the complex interactions between the MW and its satellites independently and together, in comparison to an isolated disk control simulation. The high temporal and mass resolution allows for a quantitative Fourier decomposition of the stellar kinematics, disentangling the individual influence of each satellite on the MW. In our preliminary analysis, we find that the influences from the LMC and Sgr on the disk of the MW appear distinct, additive, and separable within our tailored simulations. Notably, the corrugations induced by Sgr reproduce the large radial velocity wave seen in the data. Overall, our findings emphasise the need to include both satellites when modeling the present-day state of the MW structure and kinematics.

<title>Molecular Gas Mass Measurements of an Active, Starburst Galaxy at z ≈ 2.6 Using ALMA Observations of the [C i], CO, and Dust Emission</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of a starburst galaxy at cosmic noon hosting a radio-loud active galactic nucleus: PKS 0529-549 at z = 2.57. To investigate the conditions of its cold interstellar medium, we use ALMA observations that spatially resolve the [C i] fine-structure lines, [C i] (2–1) and [C i] (1–0), CO rotational lines, CO (7–6) and CO (4–3), and the rest-frame continuum emission at 461 and 809 GHz. The four emission lines display different morphologies, suggesting spatial variation in the gas excitation conditions. The radio jets have just broken out of the molecular gas but not through the more extended ionized gas halo. The [C i] (2–1) emission is more extended (≈8 kpc × 5 kpc) than detected in previous shallower ALMA observations. The [C i] luminosity ratio implies an excitation temperature of 44 ± 16 K, similar to the dust temperature. Using the [C i] lines, CO (4–3), and 227 GHz dust continuum, we infer the mass of molecular gas Mmol using three independent approaches and typical assumptions in the literature. All approaches point to a massive molecular gas reservoir of about 1011M☉, but the exact values differ by up to a factor of 4. Deep observations are critical in correctly characterizing the distribution of cold gas in high-redshift galaxies, and highlight the need to improve systematic uncertainties in inferring accurate molecular gas masses.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Combining Chandra, Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, EVLA, and Hubble Space Telescope archival data and newly acquired data from the Apache Point Observatory/Dual Imaging Spectrograph, we detect a double-lobed 17 kpc X-ray emission with plumes oriented approximately perpendicular and parallel to the galactic plane of the massive lenticular galaxy NGC 5084 at 0.3–2.0 keV. We detect a highly inclined ( ), molecular circumnuclear disk ( pc) in the core of the galaxy rotating (V km s−1) in a direction perpendicular to that of the galactic disk, implying a total mass of for NGC 5084's supermassive black hole. Archival EVLA radio observations at 6 and 20 cm reveal two symmetric radio lobes aligned with the galactic plane, extending to a distance of from the core, oriented with the polar axis of the circumnuclear disk. The spectral energy distribution lacks strong emission lines in the optical range. Three formation scenarios are considered to explain these multiwavelength archival observations: (1) active galactic nuclei (AGN) reorientation caused by accretion of surrounding material, (2) AGN-driven hot gas outflow directed along the galactic minor axis, or (3) a starburst/supernovae driven outflow at the core of the galaxy. This discovery is enabled by new imaging analysis tools including the Selective Amplification of Ultra Noisy Astronomical Signal, demonstrating the abundance of information still to be exploited in the vast and growing astronomical archives.

<title>UNCOVER: A NIRSpec Census of Lensed Galaxies at z = 8.50–13.08 Probing a High-AGN Fraction and Ionized Bubbles in the Shadow</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present JWST NIRSpec prism spectroscopy of lensed galaxies at z ≳ 9 found behind the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744 in the UNCOVER Cycle 1 Treasury Program. We confirm the redshift via emission lines and/or the Lyα break for 10 galaxies at z = 8.50–13.08 down to MV = −17.3. We achieve a 100% confirmation rate for z > 9 candidates reported in H. Atek et al. Using six sources with multiple line detections, we find that offsets in redshift estimates between the lines and the Lyα break alone can be ±0.2, raising caution in designing future follow-up spectroscopy for the break-only sources with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. With spec-z-confirmed sources in UNCOVER and the literature, we derive lower limits on the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function (LF) at z ≃ 9–12 and find that these lower limits agree with recent photometric measurements. We identify at least two unambiguous and several possible active galactic nucleus (AGN) systems based on X-ray, broad Hβ, high ionization lines, and excess in the UV LF. This requires the AGN LFs at z ≃ 9–10 to be comparable or even higher than the X-ray AGN LF estimated at z ∼ 6 and suggests a plausible cause of the high abundance of z > 9 galaxies claimed in the recent photometric measurements is AGNs. One UV-luminous source is confirmed at the same redshift as a broad-line AGN at z = 8.50 with a physical separation of 380 kpc in the source plane. These two sources show emission blueward of Lyα, indicating a giant ionized bubble enclosing them with a radius of 7.69 ± 0.18 pMpc. Our results imply that AGNs have a nonnegligible contribution to cosmic reionization.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The imaging of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) and the supermassive black hole at the center of Messier 87 (M87*) by the Event Horizon Telescope constrains the location and nature of emission from these objects. Coupled with flux limits from the near-infrared through the ultraviolet, the attendant size constraints provide strong evidence for the absence of an accretion-powered photosphere, and therefore for the existence of an event horizon about an astrophysical black hole. Here, we demonstrate that a broad class of naked singularities exhibit inner turning points for time-like geodesics, and therefore may generically be excluded, regardless of the nature and unknown physical impact of the singularity itself, subject to the single weak assumption that its nongravitational impact is localized to its immediate vicinity. While we restrict our attention to static, spherically symmetric spacetimes, we are nevertheless able to exclude or constrain a large number of commonly invoked naked singularity spacetimes in this way.

<title>On the Possible Mechanisms of the SEP Event and Electron Enhancement over the SEP Decay Phase on 2023 August 5</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90b1</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We carry out this study on the solar energetic particle (SEP) event that occurred on 2023 August 5 over the ascending phase of the current solar cycle 25. It is found that the SEP event might have been initiated by the M1.6 flare, while the SEP peak was caused by the coronal shock manifested in DH-type II radio burst over the propagation phase of a halo coronal mass ejection (CME; ∼1000 km s−1), thus creating a mixed SEP event. There were two enhancements of the electron fluxes lying over the SEP rise and decay phase. It is surprising that, despite a stronger flare (X1.6) and a faster halo CME (∼1647 km s−1), there was no SEP enhancement during the second enhancement of the electron fluxes. In order to investigate this, we make an additional effort to analyze the X1.6 flare based on the availability of the temporal, spectral, and spatial evolution of the electromagnetic radiation components. It is observed that the CME shock was aligned with the flare eruption direction and was close to the western limb (W77°), and thus the radially moving CME shock missed the Earth. In another development, it is observed that the electron impulsive phase lies over the type III radio bursts, indicating that the electrons might have escaped directly during the eruption. The radio flux and radio dynamic spectra of a higher frequency lie over the rise phase of the soft X-ray derivative, indicating that a large number of electrons travelled through magnetic fields.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Brown dwarfs with measured dynamical masses and spectra from direct imaging are benchmarks that anchor substellar atmosphere cooling and evolution models. We present Subaru SCExAO/CHARIS infrared spectroscopy of HIP 93398 B, a brown dwarf companion recently discovered by Y. Li et al. (2023), as part of an informed survey using the Hipparcos–Gaia Catalog of Accelerations. This object was previously classified as a T6 dwarf based on its luminosity, with its independently derived age and dynamical mass in tension with existing models of brown dwarf evolution. Spectral typing via empirical standard spectra, temperatures derived by fitting substellar atmosphere models, and J − H, J − K and colors all suggest that this object has a substantially higher temperature and luminosity, consistent with classification as a late-L dwarf near the L/T transition (T = K) with moderate to thick clouds possibly present in its atmosphere. When compared with the latest generation of evolution models that account for clouds with our revised luminosity and temperature for the object, the tension between the model-independent mass/age and model predictions is resolved.

<title>The Effects of Turbulent Electrical Resistivity on the Response of the Solar Atmosphere to Flare Energy Input. I. Results of Radiative Hydrodynamic Simulations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A number of works have considered the role of turbulence in energy release and transport in solar flares, and in particular, on the transport of energy by thermal conduction. Here, we point out that for physical consistency, the effects of turbulence on the electrical conductivity, and hence on the ohmic heating by the return current that neutralizes the current in injected electron beams, must also be considered. Using radiative hydrodynamic simulations, in conjunction with thermal and electrical conductivities modified from their collisional values by turbulent processes, we model the heating rate along a flare loop. We derive the resulting temperature, pressure, velocity, and density profiles, and use them to calculate quantities such as the differential emission measure (DEM) and the emitted X-ray spectrum. For high levels of turbulence, the combination of high electrical resistivity and low thermal conductivity acts to create and sustain a region of very large temperature near the loop apex, creating a large overpressure that acts to suppress the upward evaporation of chromospheric material. Further, the associated large temperature gradients result in a reduction of the DEM at temperatures from 105 K to 107 K. The hard X-ray spectrum at high energies is reduced due to a lower electron flux reaching the chromosphere, but at low energies, it is enhanced due to thermal emission from the very hot coronal plasma. We assess the extent to which these results can be used to constrain the nature and role of turbulent motions in the flare volume.

We report the discovery of a close binary J0606+2132 (Gaia DR3 3423365496448406272) with Pobs = 2.77 days containing a possible massive white dwarf (WD) or a neutron star (NS) using LAMOST spectroscopic data. By a joint fitting of the radial velocity from LAMOST and the light curve from TESS, we derived a circular Keplerian orbit with an inclination of i = 81.°31 , which is consistent with that derived from . Together with the mass of the visible star, we derived the mass of the invisible object to be . Spectral disentangling with the LAMOST medium-resolution spectra shows no absorption feature from an additional component, suggesting the presence of a compact object. No X-ray or radio pulsed signal is detected from ROSAT and FAST archive observations. J0606+2132 could evolve into either a Type Ia supernova or an NS through accretion-induced collapse if it is a WD or into an intermediate-mass X-ray binary if it is an NS.

We analyze accretion-rate time series for equal-mass binaries in coplanar gaseous disks spanning a continuous range of orbital eccentricities up to 0.8 for both prograde and retrograde systems. The dominant variability timescales match those of previous investigations; the binary orbital period is dominant for prograde binaries with e ≳ 0.1, with a 5 × longer “lump” period taking over for e ≲ 0.1. This lump period fades and drops from 5 × to 4.5 × the binary period as e approaches 0.1, where it vanishes. For retrograde orbits, the binary orbital period dominates at e ≲ 0.55 and is accompanied by a 2 × longer timescale periodicity at higher eccentricities. The shape of the accretion-rate time series varies with binary eccentricity. For prograde systems, the orientation of an eccentric disk causes periodic trading of accretion between the binary components in a ratio that we report as a function of binary eccentricity. We present a publicly available tool, binlite, that can rapidly (≲0.01 s) generate templates for the accretion-rate time series onto either binary component for choice of binary eccentricity below 0.8. As an example use case, we build lightcurve models where the accretion rate through the circumbinary disk and onto each binary component sets contributions to the emitted specific flux. We combine these rest-frame, accretion-variability lightcurves with observer-dependent Doppler boosting and binary self-lensing. This allows a flexible approach to generating lightcurves over a wide range of binary and observer parameter space. We envision binlite as the access point to a living database that will be updated with state-of-the-art hydrodynamical calculations as they advance.

<title>A Series of (Net) Spin-down Glitches in PSR J1522–5735: Insights from the Vortex Creep and Vortex Bending Models</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad938d</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Through a detailed timing analysis of Fermi-LAT data, the rotational behavior of the γ-ray pulsar PSR J1522−5735 was tracked from 2008 August (MJD 54692) to 2024 January (MJD 60320). During this 15.4 yr period, two overrecovery glitches and four antiglitches were identified, marking a rare occurrence in rotation-powered pulsars (RPPs). The magnitudes of these (net) spin-down glitches were determined to be ∣Δνg/ν∣ ∼ 10−8, well above the estimated detectability limit. For the two overrecovery glitches, the respective recovery fractions Q are 2.1(7) and 1.4(2). Further analysis showed no substantial variations in either the flux or pulse profile shape in any of these events, suggesting that small (net) spin-down glitches, unlike large events observed in magnetars and magnetar-like RPPs, may occur without leaving an impact on the magnetosphere. Within the framework of the vortex creep and vortex bending models, antiglitches and overrecoveries indicate the recoupling of vortex lines that moved inward as a result of a crustquake; meanwhile, the apparent fluctuations in the spin-down rate after the glitches occur as a result of the coupling of the oscillations of bent vortex lines to the magnetosphere.

<title>Hilbert Transform Reveals Unusual Modulation in Delta Scuti Star KIC 10407873</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report a δ Scuti star, KIC 10407873, exhibiting significant amplitude modulation. Fourier analysis of Kepler long-cadence data (i.e., Q0-Q17, spanning 1471 days) reveals two distinct features: harmonic series of frequencies in the low-frequency region and the frequencies of the split triplet lines in the high-frequency region. Using the Hilbert transform method, we separated the amplitude modulation signals, obtaining precise parameters for the two modulation frequencies. For the harmonic series of frequencies in the low-frequency region, we isolated them through a prewhitening process. Based on the residual segmented spectrum and the phase-folding diagram, we propose that these harmonic series of frequencies may be caused by temperature inhomogeneity on the stellar surface and stellar rotation. The subsequent phase evolution diagrams we generated, combined with LAMOST’s data, further support this hypothesis. Consequently, this suggests that the cause of amplitude modulation in the high-frequency region is unrelated to stellar rotation. Finally, we discussed the information potentially carried by the isolated modulation signals, as well as the similarities between the star’s dual-amplitude modulation and the periodically modulated Tseraskaya–Blazhko effect.

<title>Turbulent Transport Characteristics of the Particles within Pulsar Wind Nebulae 3C58 and G54.1+0.3</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Turbulent transport characteristics of the particles within two Crab-like pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe), 3C58 and G54.1+0.3, are investigated in the framework of a time-dependent turbulent diffusion model. The model takes the gyroresonant interactions between the particles and turbulent waves into account, which enables us to self-consistently determine the energy and spatial coefficients of particles within the nebula via the distributions of turbulent waves. Our application of the model to the multiband emission from 3C58 and G54.1+0.3 reveals the following. (1) The energy and spatial diffusion coefficients seem to follow quasi-linear distributions in the Kolmogorov-type turbulence, but consistent with nonlinear distributions at low energies in the Kraichnan-type turbulence due to the effects of the turbulent scattering. (2) The stochastic acceleration and spatial diffusion processes may play a role in modifying the electron spectrum in the Kolmogorov-type turbulence, whereas in the Kraichnan-type turbulence the energy exchange between the turbulent waves and particles is more efficient, resulting in more significant effects of the stochastic acceleration and spatial diffusion processes on the electron spectrum at the low energies of Ee ≲ 1 TeV. (3) At the high energies of Ee ≳ 1 TeV, the diffusion transport appears to be less effective for the evolution of the particles within 3C58 and G54.1+0.3 because the synchrotron radiative cooling process dominates over the particle transport. These two Crab-like PWNe are expected to be electron PeVatrons in the Galaxy, with a common slow diffusion escape occurring in both 3C58 and G54.1+0.3.

<title>First Resolution of Microlensed Images of a Binary-lens Event</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We resolve the multiple images of the binary-lens microlensing event ASASSN-22av using the GRAVITY instrument of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). The light curves show weak binary-lens perturbations, complicating the analysis, but the joint modeling with the VLTI data breaks several degeneracies, arriving at a strongly favored solution. Thanks to precise measurements of the angular Einstein radius θE = 0.724 ± 0.002 mas and microlens parallax, we determine that the lens system consists of two M dwarfs with masses of M1 = 0.258 ± 0.008 M⊙ and M2 = 0.130 ± 0.007 M⊙, a projected separation of r⊥ = 6.83 ± 0.31 au, and a distance of DL = 2.29 ± 0.08 kpc. The successful VLTI observations of ASASSN-22av open up a new path for studying intermediate-separation (i.e., a few astronomical units) stellar-mass binaries, including those containing dark compact objects such as neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes.

<title>DESI Emission-line Galaxies: Unveiling the Diversity of [O ii] Profiles and Its Links to Star Formation and Morphology</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8f33</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the [O ii] profiles of emission-line galaxies (ELGs) from the Early Data Release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). To this end, we decompose and classify the shape of [O ii] profiles with the first two eigenspectra derived from principal component analysis. Our results show that DESI ELGs have diverse line profiles, which can be categorized into three main types: (1) narrow lines with a median width of ∼50 km s−1, (2) broad lines with a median width of ∼80 km s−1, and (3) two redshift systems with a median velocity separation of ∼150 km s−1, i.e., double-peak galaxies. To investigate the connections between the line profiles and galaxy properties, we utilize the information from the COSMOS data set and compare the properties of ELGs, including star formation rate (SFR) and galaxy morphology, with the average properties of reference star-forming galaxies with similar stellar mass, sizes, and redshifts. Our findings show that, on average, DESI ELGs have a higher SFR and more asymmetrical/disturbed morphology than the reference galaxies. Moreover, we uncover a relationship between the line profiles, the excess SFR, and the excess asymmetry parameter, showing that DESI ELGs with broader [O ii] line profiles have more disturbed morphology and higher SFR than the reference star-forming galaxies. Finally, we discuss possible physical mechanisms giving rise to the observed relationship and the implications of our findings on the galaxy clustering measurements, including the halo occupation distribution modeling of DESI ELGs and the observed excess velocity dispersion of the satellite ELGs.

<title>A Spectroscopic and Interferometric Study of W Serpentis Stars. I. Circumbinary Outflow in the Interacting Binary W Serpentis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
W Serpentis is an eclipsing binary system and the prototype of the Serpentid class of variable stars. These are interacting binaries experiencing intense mass transfer and mass loss. However, the identities and properties of both stars in W Ser remain a mystery. Here, we present an observational analysis of high-quality, visible-band spectroscopy made with the Apache Point Observatory 3.5 m telescope and Astrophysical Research Consortium Echelle Spectrograph spectrograph plus the first near-IR, long-baseline interferometric observations obtained with the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy Array. We present examples of the appearance and radial velocities of the main spectral components: prominent emission lines, strong shell absorption lines, and weak absorption lines. We show that some of the weak absorption features are associated with the cool mass donor, and we present the first radial velocity curve for the donor star. The donor’s absorption lines are rotationally broadened, and we derive a ratio of donor to gainer mass of 0.36 ± 0.09 based on the assumptions that the donor fills its Roche lobe and that it rotates synchronously with the orbit. We use a fit of the All-Sky Automated Survey light curve to determine the orbital inclination and mass estimates of 2.0M⊙ and 5.7M⊙ for the donor and gainer, respectively. The partially resolved interferometric measurements of orbital motion are consistent with our derived orbital properties and the distance from Gaia EDR3. Spectroscopic evidence indicates that the gainer is enshrouded in an opaque disk that channels the mass transfer stream into an outflow through the L3 region and into a circumbinary disk.

<title>Generation of Fast Magnetoacoustic Waves in the Corona by Impulsive Bursty Reconnection</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9022</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Fast-mode magnetohydrodynamic waves in the solar corona are often known to be produced by solar flares and eruptive prominences. Here, we simulate the effect of the interaction of an external perturbation on a magnetic null in the solar corona, which results in the formation of a current sheet (CS). Once the CS undergoes a sufficient extension in its length and squeezing of its width, it may become unstable to the formation of multiple impulsive plasmoids. Eventually, the plasmoids merge with one another to form larger plasmoids and/or are expelled from the sheet. The formation, motion, and coalescence of plasmoids with each other and with magnetic Y-points at the outer periphery of the extended CS are found to generate wavelike perturbations. An analysis of the resultant quasiperiodic variations of pressure, density, velocity, and magnetic field at certain locations in the model corona indicates that these waves are predominantly fast-mode magnetoacoustic waves. For typical coronal parameters, the resultant propagating waves carry an energy flux of 105 erg cm−2 s−1 to a large distance of at least 60 Mm away from the CS. In general, we suggest that both waves and reconnection play a role in heating the solar atmosphere and driving the solar wind and may interact with one another in a manner that we refer to as a “symbiosis of waves and reconnection.”

<title>Connecting Lyα and Ionizing Photon Escape in the Sunburst Arc</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9247</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9247</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate the Lyα and Lyman continuum (LyC) properties of the Sunburst Arc, a z = 2.37 gravitationally lensed galaxy with a multiply imaged, compact region leaking LyC and a triple-peaked Lyα profile indicating direct Lyα escape. Non-LyC-leaking regions show a redshifted Lyα peak, a redshifted and central Lyα peak, or a triple-peaked Lyα profile. We measure the properties of the Lyα profile from different regions of the galaxy using R ∼ 5000 Magellan/Magellan Echellette spectra. We compare the Lyα spectral properties to LyC and narrowband Lyα maps from Hubble Space Telescope imaging to explore the subgalactic Lyα−LyC connection. We find strong correlations (Pearson correlation coefficient r > 0.6) between the LyC escape fraction ( ) and Lyα (1) peak separation vsep, (2) ratio of the minimum flux density between the redshifted and blueshifted Lyα peaks to continuum flux density , and (3) equivalent width. We favor a complex H i geometry to explain the Lyα profiles from non-LyC-leaking regions and suggest two H i geometries that could diffuse and/or rescatter the central Lyα peak from the LyC-leaking region into our sight line across transverse distances of several hundred parsecs. Our results emphasize the complexity of Lyα radiative transfer and its sensitivity to the anisotropies of H i gas on subgalactic scales. Large differences in the physical scales on which we observe spatially variable direct-escape Lyα, blueshifted Lyα, and escaping LyC photons in the Sunburst Arc underscore the importance of resolving the physical scales that govern Lyα and LyC escape.

<title>NIHAO-RiNG: A Comparison of Simulated Disk Galaxies from GASOLINE and GIZMO</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad924e</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad924e</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We utilize the publicly available code GIZMO to re-simulate 12 galaxies selected from the Numerical Investigation of a Hundred Astronomical Object (NIHAO) simulation suite, which were run with the GASOLINE code, then compare their properties. We find that while both codes with the same initial conditions and large-scale environments can successfully produce similar galactic disks in Milky Way-mass systems, yet significant differences are still seen in many aspects, particularly the circumgalactic medium (CGM) environment they reside in. Specifically, the thermal feedback recipe used in GASOLINE results in ubiquitous, long-term, large-scale outflows, primarily driven by high-density hot interstellar medium from the galaxy center, preventing the intergalactic medium from falling efficiently. Recycled gas and inflows in the CGM appear at 104∼5 K, playing a crucial role in the formation of cold disks in the NIHAO simulations. In contrast, disk galaxies simulated by GIZMO do not exhibit prominent outflows at low redshifts, but instead display quasi-virialized hot gas halos that arise from the interaction between inflows and feedback-driven outflows. Therefore, the origins of mass and angular momentum of the cold disk in the two simulations are quite different, even though the final morphologies of the corresponding galaxies are both disky. The differences in the distribution of CGM gas are mainly due to different feedback models implemented in the two codes. Future observations of CGM could provide valuable insight into the physics governing the baryon cycle in galaxies.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are transient radio events with millisecond-scale durations and debated origins. Collisions between planetesimals and neutron stars (NSs) have been proposed as a mechanism to produce FRBs; the planetesimal strength, size, and density determine the time duration and energy of the resulting event. One source of planetesimals is the population of interstellar objects (ISOs), free-floating objects expected to be extremely abundant in galaxies across the Universe as products of planetary formation. We explore using the ISO population as a reservoir of planetesimals for FRB production, finding that the expected ISO–NS collision rate is comparable with the observed FRB event rate. Using a model linking the properties of planetesimals and the FRBs they produce, we further show that observed FRB durations are consistent with the sizes of known ISOs, and the FRB energy distribution is consistent with the observed size distributions of solar system planetesimal populations. Finally, we argue that the rate of ISO–NS collisions must increase with cosmic time, matching the observed evolution of the FRB rate. Thus, ISO–NS collisions are a feasible mechanism for producing FRBs.

<title>Evidence for Mass-dependent Evolution of Transitional Dwarf Galaxies in the Virgo Cluster</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad973f</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The presence of transitional dwarf galaxies in cluster environments supports the hypothesis that infalling star-forming galaxies are transformed into quiescent early-type dwarf galaxies (ETdGs) through environmental effects. We present a study on the evolution of transitional dwarf galaxies, specifically dwarf lenticulars (dS0s) and early-type dwarfs with blue cores (ETdG(bc)s), driven by environmental processes in the Virgo cluster utilizing the Extended Virgo Cluster Catalog. We investigated the morphological fraction and stellar mass of transitional dwarf galaxies in relation to the clustercentric distance, compared to dwarf elliptical galaxies (dEs) and dwarf irregular galaxies (dIrrs). We found that dS0s beyond 0.7Rvir exhibit a similar trend in the morphology-clustercentric distance relation to dEs, demonstrating a decreasing fraction with clustercentric distance, whereas ETdG(bc)s display an opposite trend to dS0s but a similar trend to dIrrs. The spatial distributions of transitional dwarf galaxies and dEs correlate with the mass, in which fractions of bright, massive galaxies increase toward the central region of the Virgo cluster. In the mass-clustercentric distance plane, dS0s exhibit a skewed distribution that favors more massive galaxies than dEs at a given clustercentric distance. In the projected phase-space diagram, dS0s are scarce in the stripped region, whereas ETdG(bc)s are absent in both the stripped and virialized regions. In addition, the dS0s in the virialized region are predominantly brighter and more massive than the dEs, indicating that the transformation of dS0s into dEs depends on the stellar mass. We propose that the majority of observed dS0s constitute a population that has settled into the Virgo cluster, whereas ETdG(bc)s represent a recently accreted population. We discuss the impact of ram pressure stripping effects on mass-dependent morphological evolution, as well as the time delay between star formation quenching and morphological transformation in dwarf galaxies.

<title>Blue Luminescence from N-doped Graphene</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Blue luminescence (BL) has been observed in various astrophysical environments, such as the inner region of the Red Rectangle Nebula. It has been previously linked to small polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In this study, we explore the potential of N- and O-doped graphene material as carriers of BL. Using vacuum ultraviolet irradiation, pristine single-layer graphene films were exposed to solid N2 and O2 at low temperatures, resulting in the formation of N- or O-doped graphene. The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the synthesized N-doped graphene exhibits an asymmetrical peak at 378 nm, which is nearly identical to the BL observed in the Red Rectangle. In contrast, the synthesized O-doped graphene shows a symmetrical PL band at 414 nm. Further Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses reveal that nitrogen atoms substitute carbon atoms in the graphene lattice, introducing structural defects and sp2 regions responsible for the observed luminescence. The simplicity of the bonding structures in the N-doped graphene, dominated by pyrrolic-N and pyridinic-N groups, further supports its potential as a model system for studying BL.

<title>C+ 133.5 nm Emission Mechanisms on Mars Revealed by the MAVEN Observations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8e35</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8e35</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
C+ emission is generated by electron impact, dissociative ionization, photoionization, and resonant scattering with carbon-related atoms, molecules, and ions in the Martian ionosphere and thermosphere. The contribution of each mechanism to the emission, however, has not been elucidated due to the difficulty of observation and the fact that a part of the emission cross section is unclear. The current paper isolates the C+ emission mechanism using remote-sensing and in situ observations on board Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN. Both electron impact and dissociative ionization/photoionization contribute to C+ emission below 150 km altitude when the CO density is high, but only dissociative ionization/photoionization contributes to the emission for the low CO density case, while only dissociative ionization/photoionization dominates the emission at altitudes between 150 and 165 km for both CO density cases. It is difficult to estimate the total flux of suprathermal electrons in the ionosphere from remote-sensing observations of C+ emission because the contribution of electron impact to C+ emission is small. In contrast, C-atom remote-sensing observations might provide a better understanding of the total flux of suprathermal electrons in the ionosphere than C+ emission, and global ultraviolet observations could be utilized as a tool for monitoring the ionosphere. The total flux of suprathermal electrons estimated from C-atom emission may be utilized to isolate the contribution of each C+ emission process to the brightness more accurately. This suggests that the C+ and C-atom emissions might be tracers of spatiotemporal variations in the Martian ionosphere and thermosphere.

<title>Investigating the Intracluster Medium Viscosity Using the Tails of GASP Jellyfish Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The microphysics of the intracluster medium (ICM) in galaxy clusters is still poorly understood. Observational evidence suggests that the effective viscosity is suppressed by plasma instabilities that reduce the mean free path of particles. Measuring the effective viscosity of the ICM is crucial to understanding the processes that govern its physics on small scales. The trails of ionized interstellar medium left behind by the so-called jellyfish galaxies can trace the turbulent motions of the surrounding ICM and constrain its local viscosity. We present the results of a systematic analysis of the velocity structure function (VSF) of the Hα line for ten galaxies from the GASP sample. The VSFs show a sublinear power-law scaling below 10 kpc that may result from turbulent cascading and extends to 1 kpc, which is below the supposed ICM dissipation scales of tens of kpc expected in a fluid described by Coulomb collisions. Our result constrains the local ICM viscosity to be 0.3%–25% of the expected Spitzer value. Our findings demonstrate that either the ICM particles have a smaller mean free path than expected in a regime defined by Coulomb collisions or that we are probing effects due to collisionless physics in the ICM turbulence.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In magnetic reconnection, the ion bulk outflow speed and ion heating have been shown to be set by the available reconnecting magnetic energy, i.e., the energy stored in the reconnecting magnetic field (Br). However, recent simulations, observations, and theoretical works have shown that the released magnetic energy is inhibited by upstream ion plasma beta βi—the relative ion thermal pressure normalized to magnetic pressure based on the reconnecting field—for antiparallel magnetic field configurations. Using kinetic theory and hybrid particle-in-cell simulations, we investigate the effects of βi on guide field reconnection. While previous works have suggested that guide field reconnection is uninfluenced by βi, we demonstrate that the reconnection process is modified and the outflow is reduced for sufficiently large . We develop a theoretical framework that shows that this reduction is consistent with an enhanced exhaust pressure gradient, which reduces the outflow speed as . These results apply to systems in which guide field reconnection is embedded in hot plasmas, such as reconnection at the boundary of eddies in fully developed turbulence like the solar wind or the magnetosheath as well as downstream of shocks such as the heliosheath or the mergers of galaxy clusters.

<title>AstroSat View of the Neutron Star Low-mass X-Ray Binary GX 5-1</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the spectral and timing study of the bright neutron star low-mass X-ray binary GX 5-1 using AstroSat/Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter (LAXPC) and Soft X-ray Telescope observations conducted in 2018. During the observation, the source traces out the complete horizontal branch (HB) and normal branch (NB) of the Z-track in the hardness–intensity diagram (HID). Understanding the spectral and temporal evolution of the source along the Z-track can probe the accretion process in the vicinity of a neutron star. Spectral analysis was performed in the 0.7–20 keV energy range for different segments in the HID using a multitemperature disk blackbody with an average temperature, kTin ∼ 0.47, and a thermal Comptonization model. It is found that the optical depth of the corona drops from ∼7.07 in HB to ∼2.61 in NB. The timing analysis using the LAXPC instrument indicates the presence of quasiperiodic oscillations in HB and NB of the Z-track. The observed QPO frequencies are similar to the characteristic frequencies of horizontal branch oscillations (HBOs) and normal branch oscillations (NBOs). The HBO frequency increases from ∼12 to 40 Hz toward the hard apex. NBOs are observed at ∼5 Hz. The timing studies conducted in soft and hard bands indicate the association of HBO and NBO origin with the nonthermal component. Further research could explore the implications of this relationship for understanding the dynamics of accretion onto neutron stars.

Previous Hubble Space Telescope observations of the star-forming cluster NGC 346 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) revealed a large population of pre-main-sequence (PMS) candidates, characterized by Hα excess emission in their photometry. However, without access to spectroscopy, the nature of these objects remained unclear. Using the NIRSpec instrument on board JWST, we studied a sample of these stars, with masses in the range of ∼0.9−1.8 M⊙, effective temperatures (Teff) in the range of 4500−8000 K, and PMS ages between ∼0.1 and 30 Myr. Here, we present the first spectra of solar-mass PMS stars in the metal-poor SMC (Z = 1/8 Z⊙) and discuss the physical properties of 10 representative sources with good signal-to-noise ratio. The observations indicate that even the oldest of these PMS candidates are still accreting gas with typical rates of ∼10−8M⊙ yr−1 for stars older than ∼10 Myr, confirming their PMS nature. The spectra also reveal near-infrared excess and molecular hydrogen excitation lines consistent with the presence of disks around these stars. These findings suggest that in a low-metallicity environment, circumstellar disks can live longer than previously thought.

<title>New Evidence for a Flux-independent Spectral Index of Sgr A* in the Near-infrared</title>

In this work, we measure the spectral index of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) between the H (1.6 μm) and (2.2 μm) broadband filters in the near-infrared (NIR), sampling over a factor ∼40 in brightness, the largest range probed to date by a factor ∼3. Sgr A*-NIR is highly variable, and studying the spectral index α (with Fν ∝ να) is essential to determine the underlying emission mechanism. For example, variations in α with flux may arise from shifts in the synchrotron cutoff frequency, changes in the distribution of electrons, or multiple concurrent emission mechanisms. We investigate potential variations of with flux by analyzing seven epochs (2005–2022) of Keck Observatory imaging observations from the Galactic Center Orbits Initiative. We remove the flux contribution of known sources confused with SgrA*-NIR, which can significantly impact color at faint flux levels. We interpolate between the interleaved H and observations using multi-output Gaussian processes. We introduce a flexible empirical model to quantify α variations and probe different scenarios. The observations are best fit by an that is constant from ∼1 mJy to ∼40 mJy (dereddened 2 μm flux). We find no evidence for a flux dependence of Sgr A*'s intrinsic spectral index. In particular, we rule out a model explaining NIR variability purely by shifts in the synchrotron cutoff frequency. We also constrain the presence of redder, quiescent emission from the black hole, concluding that the dereddened 2 μm flux contribution must be ≤0.3 mJy at 95% confidence level.

<title>Convective Mixing in Gas Giant Planets with Primordial Composition Gradients</title>

Linking atmospheric measurements to the bulk planetary composition and ultimately the planetary origin is a key objective in planetary science. In this work, we identify the cases in which the atmospheric composition represents the bulk composition. We simulate the evolution of giant planets considering a wide range of planetary masses (0.3–2 MJ), initial entropies ( ), and primordial heavy-element profiles. We find that convective mixing is most efficient at early times (ages ≲107 yr) and that primordial composition gradients can be eroded. In several cases, however, the atmospheric composition can differ widely from the planetary bulk composition, with the exact outcome depending on the details. We show that the efficiency of convection is primarily controlled by the underlying entropy profile: For low primordial entropies of , convective mixing can be inhibited and composition gradients can persist over billions of years. The scaling of mixing efficiency with mass is governed by the primordial entropy. For the same primordial entropy, low-mass planets mix more efficiently than high-mass planets. If the primordial internal entropy would increase with mass, however, this trend could reverse. We also present a new analytical model that predicts convective mixing under the existence of composition (and entropy) gradients. Our results emphasize the complexity in the interpretation of atmospheric abundance measurements and show the great need to better understand the planetary formation process as it plays a key role in determining the planetary evolution and final structure.

<title>Large-scale Magnetic Field Model of GRB Afterglow Polarization: Effects of Field Anisotropy, Off-axis Viewing Angle, and Ordered Field</title>

The afterglows of gamma-ray bursts are nonthermal electron synchrotron emissions from relativistic shocks. The origin of strong magnetic field in the emission region remains elusive, and two field amplification mechanisms via the plasma kinetic and magnetohydrodynamic instabilities have been discussed. The polarimetric observations are a powerful probe to distinguish these two mechanisms. So far, most theoretical works have focused on the former mechanism and constructed afterglow polarization models with microscopic-scale turbulence whose coherence length is much smaller than the thickness of the blast wave. In this work, focusing on the latter mechanism, we utilize our semianalytic model of the synchrotron polarization with large-scale turbulence whose coherence length is comparable to the thickness of the blast wave to investigate the effect of magnetic field anisotropy and the observer viewing angle. We find that the polarization in our large-scale turbulence model can exhibit both behaviors characteristic of the microscopic-scale turbulence model and those not seen in the microscopic-scale model. Then we find that the large-scale model could explain all the polarimetric observational data to date that seem to be forward shock emission. We also examine the effect of ordered-field components and find that polarization degree and polarization angle constant in time are realized only when the energy density ratio of the ordered and fluctuated components is ≳50. In this case, however, the polarization degree is much higher than the observed values.

<title>Fast and Flexible Inference Framework for Continuum Reverberation Mapping Using Simulation-based Inference with Deep Learning</title>

Continuum reverberation mapping (CRM) of active galactic nuclei (AGN) monitors multiwavelength variability signatures to constrain accretion disk structure and supermassive black hole (SMBH) properties. The upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time will survey tens of millions of AGN over the next decade, with thousands of AGN monitored with almost daily cadence in the deep drilling fields. However, existing CRM methodologies often require long computation time and are not designed to handle such large amounts of data. In this paper, we present a fast and flexible inference framework for CRM using simulation-based inference (SBI) with deep learning to estimate SMBH properties from AGN light curves. We use a long short-term memory summary network to reduce the high dimensionality of the light curve data and then use a neural density estimator to estimate the posterior of SMBH parameters. Using simulated light curves, we find SBI can produce more accurate SMBH parameter estimation with 103–105 times speed up in inference efficiency compared to traditional methods. The SBI framework is particularly suitable for wide-field CRM surveys as the light curves will have identical observing patterns, which can be incorporated into the SBI simulation. We explore the performance of our SBI model on light curves with irregular-sampled, realistic observing cadence and alternative variability characteristics to demonstrate the flexibility and limitation of the SBI framework.

<title>PyMerger: Detecting Binary Black Hole Mergers from the Einstein Telescope Using Deep Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present PyMerger, a Python tool for detecting binary black hole (BBH) mergers from the Einstein Telescope (ET), based on a deep residual neural network (ResNet) model. ResNet was trained on data combined from all three proposed subdetectors of ET (TSDCD) to detect BBH mergers. Five different lower-frequency cutoffs (Flow)—5 Hz, 10 Hz, 15 Hz, 20 Hz, and 30 Hz—with the match-filter signal-to-noise ratio (MSNR) ranges 4–5, 5–6, 6–7, 7–8, and >8 were employed in the data simulation. Compared to previous work that utilized data from a single subdetector, the detection accuracy from TSDCD has shown substantial improvements, increasing from 60%, 60.5%, 84.5%, 94.5%, and 98.5% to 78.5%, 84%, 99.5%, 100%, and 100% for sources with MSNRs of 4–5, 5–6, 6–7, 7–8, and >8, respectively. The ResNet model is evaluated on the first ET mock data challenge (ET-MDC1) data set, where the model demonstrates strong performance in detecting BBH mergers, identifying 5566 out of 6578 BBH events, with optimal SNRs starting from 1.2 and a minimum and maximum DL of 0.5 Gpc and 148.95 Gpc, respectively. Despite being trained only on BBH mergers without overlapping sources, the model achieves high BBH detection rates. Notably, even though the model was not trained on binary neutron star (BNS) and black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers, it successfully detected 11,477 BNS and 323BHNS mergers in ET-MDC1, with optimal SNRs starting from 0.2 and 1, respectively, indicating its potential for broader applicability.

Active galactic nucleus (AGN) bubbles in cool-core galaxy clusters are believed to facilitate the transport of cosmic-ray electrons (CRe) throughout the cluster. Recent radio observations reveal the complex morphologies of cluster diffuse emission, potentially linked to interactions between AGN bursts and the cluster environment. We perform 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations of binary cluster mergers and inject a bidirectional jet at the center of the main cluster. Kinetic, thermal, magnetic, and cosmic ray (CR) energy are included in the jet and we use the two-fluid formalism to model the CR component. We explore a wide range of cluster merger and jet parameters. We discuss the formation of various wide-angle-tail and X-shaped sources in the early evolution of the jet and merger. During the last phase of the evolution, we find that the CR material efficiently permeates the central region of the cluster reaching radii of ∼1–2 Mpc within ∼5–6 Gyr, depending on the merger mass ratio. We find that solenoidal turbulence dominates during the binary merger and we explore the possibility for the CR jet material to be reaccelerated by super-Alfvènic turbulence and contribute to cluster scale radio emission. We find high volume fractions, ≳70%, at which the turbulent acceleration time is shorter than the electron cooling time. Finally, we study the merger shock interaction with the CRe material and show that it is unlikely that this material significantly contributes to the radio relic emission associated with the shocks. We suggest that multiple jet outbursts and/or off-center radio galaxies would increase the likelihood of detecting these merger shocks in the radio due to shock reacceleration.

<title>Kicking Time Back in Black Hole Mergers: Ancestral Masses, Spins, Birth Recoils, and Hierarchical-formation Viability of GW190521</title>

A pair-instability supernova (PISN) prevents black hole (BH) formation from stellar collapse within the approximate mass range M ∈ [65, 130] M⊙. However, such BHs may form hierarchically through merging ancestral BHs, whose properties determine those of the “child” one: mass, spin, and recoil velocity. Crucially, the child will leave its host environment if its birth recoil exceeds the corresponding escape velocity, preventing further mergers. We exploit relations between the final recoil and spin of quasi-circular BH mergers to obtain posterior probability distributions for the hypothetical ancestral masses, spins, and birth recoils of the component BHs of GW190521. To this, we present a Bayesian framework applicable to existing estimates for the components of BH merger observations. We consider both the quasi-circular (generically spinning) analysis performed by the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA collaboration and the eccentric (aligned-spin) one performed by Romero-Shaw et al. We evaluate the probability p2g that the GW190521 components inferred by these analyses formed from the merger of stellar-origin BHs and were retained by their environment. For the primary component, which populates the PISN gap, such scenario is strongly suppressed if GW190521 happened in a globular cluster with p2g ∼ 10−3 unless it was quasi circular and its ancestors had aligned spins, uncharacteristic of hierarchical formation channels, or small spins, which yields p2g ≃ 10−2. If GW190521 was eccentric, we obtain p2g ≃ 0.1 for any host other than an active galactic nucleus, and zero for a globular cluster. If GW190521 was quasi circular, a nuclear star cluster origin is possible with p2g ∈ (∼0.4, ∼0.8).

<title>The Hubble Constant Anchor Galaxy NGC 4258: Metallicity and Distance from Blue Supergiants</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A quantitative spectroscopic study of blue supergiant stars in the Hubble constant anchor galaxy NGC 4258 is presented. The non-LTE analysis of Keck I telescope LRIS spectra yields a central logarithmic metallicity (in units of the solar value) of [Z] = −0.05 ± 0.05 and a very shallow gradient of −(0.09 ± 0.11) r/r25 with respect to galactocentric distance in units of the isophotal radius. Good agreement with the mass–metallicity relationship of star-forming galaxies based on stellar absorption line studies is found. A comparison with H ii region oxygen abundances obtained from the analysis of strong emission lines shows reasonable agreement when the M. Pettini & B. E. J. Pagel calibration is used, while the D. Zaritsky et al. calibration yields values that are 0.2–0.3 dex larger. These results allow us to put the metallicity calibration of the Cepheid period–luminosity relation in this anchor galaxy on a purely stellar basis. Interstellar reddening and extinction are determined using Hubble Space Telescope and JWST photometry. Based on extinction-corrected magnitudes, combined with the stellar effective temperatures and gravities we determine, we use the flux-weighted gravity–luminosity relationship to estimate an independent spectroscopic distance. We obtain a distance modulus m − M = 29.38 ± 0.12 mag, in agreement with the geometrical distance derived from the analysis of the water maser orbits in the galaxy’s central circumnuclear disk.

<title>Spectro-temporal Evolution of 4U 1702-429 Using AstroSat-NICER</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the broadband spectral and timing properties of the atoll source 4U 1702-429 using two observations of AstroSat with the second one having simultaneous NICER data. For both observations, the spectra can be represented by a Comptonizing medium with a blackbody seed photon source that can be identified with the surface of the neutron star. A disk emission along with a distant reflection is also required for both spectra. For the first observation, the coronal temperature (∼7 keV) is smaller than the second (∼13 keV), and the disk is truncated at a larger radius, ∼150 km, compared to the second, ∼25 km, for an assumed distance of 7 kpc. A kHz quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) at ∼800 Hz is detected in the first and is absent in the second observation. Modeling the energy-dependent rms and time lag of the kHz QPO reveals a corona size of ≤30 km. A similar model can explain the energy dependence of the broadband noise at ∼10 Hz for the second observation. The results suggest that kHz QPOs are associated with a compact corona surrounding the neutron star and may occur when the disk is truncated at large distances. We emphasize the need for more wide-band observations of the source to confirm these results.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present simultaneous X-ray and spectral ultraviolet observations of strikingly coherent oscillations in emission from a coronal looptop and fan structure, during the impulsive phase of a long-duration M-class solar flare. The ≈50 s oscillations are observed near in-phase by Solar Orbiter/STIX, GOES, and IRIS Fe xxi intensity, Doppler, and nonthermal velocity. For over 5 minutes of their approximate 35 minute duration, the oscillations are so periodic (2σ above the power-law background) that they are better described as “periodic pulsations” than the more widely documented “quasiperiodic pulsations” often observed during solar flares. By combining time-series analysis of the multi-instrument data sets with comparison to magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we attribute the oscillations to the magnetic tuning fork in the flare looptop–fan region, and betatron acceleration within the lower-altitude flare loops. These interpretations are possible due to the introduced Sliding Raster Method (SliRM) for analysis of slit spectrometer (e.g., IRIS) raster data, to increase the temporal cadence of the observations at the expense of spatial information.

<title>Multizone Modeling of Black Hole Accretion and Feedback in 3D GRMHD: Bridging Vast Spatial and Temporal Scales</title>

Simulating accretion and feedback from the horizon scale of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) out to galactic scales is challenging because of the vast range of scales involved. Elaborating on H. Cho et al., we describe and test a “multizone” technique, which is designed to tackle this difficult problem in three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. While short-timescale variability should be interpreted with caution, the method is demonstrated to be well-suited for finding dynamical steady states over a wide dynamic range. We simulate accretion on a nonspinning SMBH (a* = 0) using initial conditions and the external galactic potential from a large-scale galaxy simulation and achieve a steady state over eight decades in radius. As found in H. Cho et al., the density scales with radius as ρ ∝ r−1 inside the Bondi radius RB, which is located at RB = 2 × 105rg (≈60 pc for M87), where rg is the gravitational radius of the SMBH; the plasma-β is ∼ unity, indicating an extended magnetically arrested state; the mass accretion rate is ≈1% of the analytical Bondi accretion rate and there is continuous energy feedback out to ≈100RB (or beyond > kpc) at a rate . Surprisingly, no ordered rotation in the external medium survives as the magnetized gas flows to smaller radii, and the final steady solution is very similar to when the exterior has no rotation. Using the multizone method, we simulate GRMHD accretion over a wide range of Bondi radii, RB ∼ 102−107rg, and find that .

<title>Exact Nonlinear Decomposition of Ideal-MHD Waves Using Eigenenergies. II. Fully Analytical Equations and Pseudoadvective Eigenenergies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Physical insight into plasma evolution in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit can be revealed by decomposing the evolution according to the characteristic modes of the system. In this paper we explore aspects of the eigenenergy decomposition method (EEDM) introduced in an earlier study (ApJ, 967:80). The EEDM provides an exact decomposition of nonlinear MHD disturbances into their component eigenenergies associated with the slow, Alfvén, and fast eigenmodes, together with two zero-frequency eigenmodes. Here we refine the EEDM by presenting globally analytical expressions for the eigenenergies. We also explore the nature of the zero-frequency “pseudoadvective (PA) modes” in detail. We show that in evolutions with pure advection of magnetic and thermal energy (without propagating waves), a part of the energy is carried by the PA modes. Exact expressions for the error terms associated with these modes—commonly encountered in numerical simulations—are also introduced. The new EEDM equations provide a robust tool for the exact and unique decomposition of nonlinear disturbances governed by homogeneous quasi-linear partial differential equations, even in the presence of local or global degeneracies.

<title>Effects of Background Solar Wind and Drag Force on the Propagation of Coronal-mass-ejection-driven Shocks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The propagation of interplanetary shocks, particularly those driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs), is still an outstanding question in heliophysics and space weather forecasting. Here, we address the effects of the ambient solar wind on the propagation of two similar CME-driven shocks from the Sun to Earth. The two shock events (CME03, 2010 April 3; CME12, 2012 July 12) have the following properties. Both events (1) were driven by a halo CME (i.e., the source location is near the Sun–Earth line); (2) had a CME source in the southern hemisphere; (3) had a similar transit time (∼2 days) to Earth; (4) occurred in a nonquiet solar period; and (5) led to a severe geomagnetic storm. The initial (near the Sun) propagation speed, as measured by coronagraph images, was slower (by ∼300 km s−1) for CME03 than CME12, but it took about the same amount of traveling time for both events to reach Earth. According to the in situ solar wind observations from the Wind spacecraft, the CME03-driven shock was associated with a faster solar wind upstream of the shock than the CME12-driven shock. This is also demonstrated in our global MHD simulations. Analysis of our simulation result indicates that the drag force indirectly plays an important role in the shock propagation. The present study suggests that in addition to the initial CME propagation speed near the Sun, the shock speed (in the inertial frame) and the ambient solar wind conditions—in particular, the solar wind speed—are key to timing the arrival of CME-driven shock events.

<title>Gone with the Molecular Wind: Photoevaporation in the Compact Dust Disk around CX Tau</title>

We present Keck NIRSPEC+AO high-resolution (R ∼ 25,000), mid-infrared (M-band: 4.6–5.2 μm) spectra of the protoplanetary disk CX Tau. CX Tau provides an ideal laboratory to study inner disk chemistry in a disk where the signs of radial drift of pebbles are present in the form of a compact mm dust disk and extended gas disk. Our data covers many 12CO v = 1–0 ro-vibrational transitions, in addition to 13CO and 12CO v = 2–1. We find no evidence for CO emission in the inner disk of CX Tau at the level of 8 × 1016 cm−2, but do detect narrow, blueshifted absorption at ∼−6 km s−1. A rotation diagram analysis shows that the gas temperature ranges from about 10 to 350 K, with column densities ∼9 × 1015 and 3 × 1017 cm−2, respectively. In addition to our Keck-NIRSPEC spectra, we create line maps from archival JWST-MIRI IFU data using custom JDISCS reduction techniques. These maps show spatially extended (∼500 au) H2 and [ Ne ii]. The blueshifted CO absorption and extended H2 and [Ne ii] are evidence of a photoevaporative disk wind. We estimate a wind mass-loss rate from the H2 S(1) line of ∼10−9 M⊙ yr−1, which is approximately equal to the stellar accretion rate and suggests that CX Tau is in the early stages of disk dispersal.

<title>Do Neutron Star Ultraluminous X-Ray Sources Masquerade as Intermediate-mass Black Holes in Radio and X-Ray?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) were once largely believed to be powered by super-Eddington accretion onto stellar-mass black holes, although in some rare cases, ULXs also serve as potential candidates for (sub-Eddington) intermediate-mass black holes. However, a total of eight ULXs have now been confirmed to be powered by neutron stars, thanks to observed pulsations, and may act as contaminants for the radio/X-ray selection of intermediate-mass black holes. Here, we present the first comprehensive radio study of seven known neutron star ULXs using new and archival data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array and the Australia Telescope Compact Array, combined with the literature. Across this sample, there is only one confident radio detection, from the Galactic neutron star ULX Swift J0243.6+6124. The other six objects in our sample are extragalactic, and only one has coincident radio emission, which we conclude is most likely contamination from a background H ii region. We conclude that with current facilities, neutron star ULXs do not produce significant enough radio emission to cause them to be misidentified as radio-/X-ray-selected intermediate-mass black hole candidates. Thus, if background star formation has been properly considered, the current study indicates that a ULX with a compact radio counterpart is not likely to be a neutron star.

<title>Dust-obscured Galaxies in the XMM-SERVS Fields: Selection, Multiwavelength Characterization, and Physical Nature</title>

Dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) are enshrouded by dust and many are believed to host accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs), which makes them unique objects for probing the coevolution of galaxies and SMBHs. We select and characterize DOGs in the 13 deg2 XMM-Spitzer Extragalactic Representative Volume Survey (XMM-SERVS), leveraging the superb multiwavelength data—from X-rays to radio. We select 3738 DOGs at z ≈ 1.6–2.1 in XMM-SERVS, while maintaining good data quality without introducing significant bias. This represents the largest DOG sample with thorough multiwavelength source characterization. Spectral energy distribution modeling shows DOGs are a heterogeneous population consisting of both normal galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our DOGs are massive ( ), 174 are detected in X-rays, and they are generally radio-quiet systems. X-ray detected DOGs are luminous and are moderately to heavily obscured in X-rays. Stacking analyses for the X-ray undetected DOGs show highly significant average detections. Critically, we compare DOGs with matched galaxy populations. DOGs have similar AGN fractions compared with typical galaxy populations. X-ray detected DOGs have higher M⋆ and higher X-ray obscuration, but they are not more star-forming than typical X-ray AGNs. Our results potentially challenge the relevance of the merger-driven galaxy-SMBH coevolution framework for X-ray detected DOGs.

<title>Considerations for Photochemical Modeling of Possible Hycean Worlds</title>

JWST is revolutionising the study of temperate sub-Neptunes, starting with the first detection of carbon-bearing molecules in the habitable-zone sub-Neptune K2-18 b. The retrieved abundances of CH4 and CO2 and nondetection of NH3 and CO in K2-18 b are consistent with prior predictions of photochemical models for a Hycean world with a habitable ocean. However, recent photochemical modeling raised the prospect that the observed abundances may be explained by a mini-Neptune scenario instead. In this study, we explore these scenarios using independent photochemical modeling with K2-18 b as a case study. We find the previous results to be sensitive to a range of model assumptions, such as the photochemical cross sections, incident stellar spectrum, surface pressure, UV albedo, and metallicity, significantly affecting the resulting abundances. We explore a wide model space to investigate scenarios that are compatible with the retrieved molecular abundances for K2-18 b. Our analysis shows that the previously favored mini-Neptune scenario is not compatible with most of the retrieved abundances, while the Hycean scenarios, both inhabited and uninhabited, provide better agreement. An uninhabited Hycean scenario explains most of the abundance constraints, except CH4, which is generally underabundant but dependent on the model assumptions. The inhabited Hycean scenario is compatible with all the abundances if the observed CH4 is assumed to be predominantly biogenic. Our results underscore the importance of systematic photochemical modeling and accurate interpretation of chemical abundance constraints for candidate Hycean worlds.

<title>A High-resolution Far-infrared Survey to Probe Black Hole–Galaxy Co-evolution</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8e36</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8e36</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Far-infrared (FIR) surveys are critical to probing the co-evolution of black holes and galaxies, since of the order of half the light from accreting black holes and active star formation is emitted in the rest-frame IR over 0.5 ≲ z ≲ 10. For deep fields with areas of 1 deg2 or less, like the legacy surveys GOODS, COSMOS, and CANDELS, source crowding means that subarcsecond resolution is essential. In this paper, we show with a simulation of the FIR sky that observations made with a small telescope (2 m) at low angular resolution preferentially detect the brightest galaxies, and we demonstrate the scientific value of a space mission that would offer subarcsecond resolution. We envisage a facility that would provide high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy over the wavelength range 25–400 μm, and we present predictions for an extragalactic survey covering 0.5 deg2. Such a survey is expected to detect tens of thousands of star-forming galaxies and thousands of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), in multiple FIR lines (e.g., [C ii], [O i], and [C i]) and continuum. At the longest wavelengths (200–400 μm), it would probe beyond the Epoch of Reionization, up to z ∼ 7–8. A combination of spectral resolution, line sensitivity, and broad spectral coverage would allow us to learn about the physical conditions (temperature, density, and metallicity) characterizing the interstellar medium of galaxies over the past ∼12 billion years and to investigate galaxy–AGN co-evolution.

<title>Signature of Triaxially Precessing Magnetars in Gamma-Ray Burst X-Ray Afterglows</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9005</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9005</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The X-ray afterglows of some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) exhibit plateaus, which can be explained by the internal dissipation of a newborn millisecond magnetar wind. In the early phase of these newborn magnetars, the magnetic inclination angle undergoes periodic changes due to precession, leading to periodic modulation of the injection luminosity due to magnetic dipole radiation. This may result in quasiperiodic oscillations on the plateaus. In this paper, we identify four GRBs with regular flux variations on their X-ray afterglow plateaus from Swift/X-Ray Telescope data before 2023 November, three of which exhibit periodicity. Based on the likelihood of supporting a precessing magnetar as the central engine, we classify them into three categories: Gold (GRB 060202 and GRB 180620A), Silver (GRB 050730), and Bronze (GRB 210610A). We invoke a model of magnetic dipole radiation emitted by a triaxially freely precessing magnetar whose spindown is dominated by electromagnetic radiation, to fit the light curves. Our model successfully reproduces the light curves of these four GRBs, including the regular flux variations on the plateaus and their periodicity (if present). Our work provides further evidence for early precession in newborn millisecond magnetars in GRBs.

<title>The Pulsar Science Collaboratory: Multiepoch Scintillation Studies of Pulsars</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9008</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report on findings from scintillation analyses using high-cadence observations of eight canonical pulsars with observing baselines ranging from 1–3 yr. We obtain scintillation bandwidth and timescale measurements for all pulsars in our survey and scintillation arc curvature measurements for four, and we detect multiple arcs for two. We find evidence of a previously undocumented scattering screen along the line of sight (LOS) to PSR J1645−0317, as well as evidence that a scattering screen along the LOS to PSR J2313+4253 may reside somewhere within the Milky Way’s Orion–Cygnus arm. We report evidence of a significant change in the scintillation pattern in PSR J2022+5154 from the previous two decades of literature, wherein both the scintillation bandwidth and timescale decreased by an order of magnitude relative to earlier observations at the same frequencies, potentially as a result of a different screen dominating the observed scattering. By augmenting the results of previous studies, we find general agreement with estimations of scattering delays from pulsar observations and predictions by the NE2001 electron density model but not for the newest data we have collected, providing some evidence of changes in the ISM along various LOSs over the timespans considered. In a similar manner, we find additional evidence of a correlation between a pulsar’s dispersion measure and the overall variability of its scattering delays over time. The plethora of interesting science obtained through these observations demonstrates the capabilities of the Green Bank Observatory’s 20 m telescope to contribute to pulsar-based studies of the interstellar medium.

<title>Modeling the Multiwavelength Detection of Protoclusters. I. An Excess of Submillimeter Galaxies in Protocluster Cores</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90ae</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90ae</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Studies of galaxy protoclusters yield insights into galaxy cluster formation complementary to those obtained via “archaeological” studies of present-day galaxy clusters. Submillimeter-selected galaxies (SMGs) are one class of sources used to find high-redshift protoclusters. However, due to the rarity of protoclusters (and thus the large simulation volume required) and the complexity of modeling dust emission from galaxies, the relationship between SMGs and protoclusters has not been adequately addressed in the theoretical literature. In this work, we apply the L-GALAXIES semianalytic model (SAM) to the MillenniumN-body simulation. We assign submillimeter flux densities to the model galaxies using a scaling relation from previous work, in which dust radiative transfer was performed on high-resolution galaxy zoom simulations. We find that the fraction of model galaxies that are submillimeter-bright is higher in protocluster cores than in both protocluster “outskirts” and the field; the fractions for the latter two are similar. This excess is not driven by an enhanced starburst frequency. Instead, the primary reason is that overdense environments have a relative overdensity of high-mass halos and thus “oversample” the high-mass end of the star formation main sequence relative to less-dense environments. The fraction of SMGs that are optically bright is dependent on stellar mass and redshift but independent of the environment. The fraction of galaxies for which the majority of star formation is dust-obscured is higher in protocluster cores, primarily due to the dust-obscured fraction being correlated with stellar mass. Our results can be used to guide and interpret multiwavelength studies of galaxy populations in protoclusters.

<title>Massive Star Cluster Formation with Binaries. I. Evolution of Binary Populations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90b3</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90b3</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the evolution of populations of binary stars within massive cluster-forming regions. We simulate the formation of young massive star clusters within giant molecular clouds with masses ranging from 2 × 104 to 3.2 × 105 M⊙. We use Torch, which couples stellar dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, star and binary formation, stellar evolution, and stellar feedback through the Amuse framework. We find that the binary fraction decreases during cluster formation at all molecular cloud masses. The binaries’ orbital properties also change, with stronger and quicker changes in denser, more massive clouds. Most of the changes we see can be attributed to the disruption of binaries wider than 100 au, although the close binary fraction also decreases in the densest cluster-forming region. The binary fraction for O stars remains above 90%, but exchanges and dynamical hardening are ubiquitous, indicating that O stars undergo frequent few-body interactions early during the cluster formation process. Changes to the populations of binaries are a by-product of hierarchical cluster assembly: most changes to the binary population take place when the star formation rate is high, and there are frequent mergers between subclusters in the cluster-forming region. A universal primordial binary distribution based on observed inner companions in the Galactic field is consistent with the binary populations of young clusters with resolved stellar populations, and the scatter between clusters of similar masses could be explained by differences in their formation history.

<title>The Application of Manifold Learning to a Selection of Different Galaxy Populations and Scaling Relation Analysis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The growing volume of data produced by large astronomical surveys necessitates the development of efficient analysis techniques capable of effectively managing high-dimensional data sets. This study addresses this need by demonstrating some applications of manifold learning and dimensionality reduction techniques, specifically the self-organizing map (SOM), on the optical+near-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) space of galaxies, with a focus on sample comparison, selection biases, and predictive power using a small subset. To this end, we utilize a large photometric sample from the five Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey fields and a subset with spectroscopic measurements from the KECK MOSDEF survey in two redshift bins at z ∼ 1.5 and z ∼ 2.2. We trained the SOM with the photometric data and mapped the spectroscopic data onto it as our study case. We found that MOSDEF targets do not cover all SED shapes existing in the SOM. Our findings reveal that active galactic nuclei within the MOSDEF sample are mapped onto the more massive regions of the SOM, confirming previous studies and known selection biases toward higher-mass, less dusty galaxies. Furthermore, SOMs were utilized to map measured spectroscopic features, examining the relationship between metallicity variations and galaxy mass. Our analysis confirmed that more massive galaxies exhibit lower [O iii]/Hβ and [O iii]/[O ii] ratios and higher Hα/Hβ ratios, consistent with the known mass–metallicity relation. These findings highlight the effectiveness of SOMs in analyzing and visualizing complex, multidimensional data sets, emphasizing their potential in data-driven astronomical studies.

<title>Making the Invisible Visible: Magnetic Fields in Accretion Flows Revealed by X-Ray Polarization</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9277</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9277</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Large-scale, strong magnetic fields are often evoked in black hole accretion flows, for jet launching in the low/hard state and to circumvent the thermal instability in the high/soft state. Here, we show how these ideas are strongly challenged by X-ray polarization measurements from the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). Quite general arguments show that equipartition large-scale fields in the accretion flow should be of order 106–8 G. These produce substantial Faraday rotation and/or depolarization. Since IXPE observes polarization in both spectral states, this sets upper limits to coherent large-scale (vertical, radial, or azimuthal) magnetic fields in the photosphere of B ≲ 5 × 106 G. While we stress that Faraday rotation should be calculated for each individual simulation (density, field geometry, and emissivity), it seems most likely that there are no equipartition-strength large-scale ordered fields inside the photosphere of the X-ray-emitting gas. Strong poloidal fields can still power a Blandford–Znajek jet in the low/hard state if they thread the black hole horizon rather than the X-ray-emitting flow, but this could also be challenged by (lack of) depolarization from vacuum birefringence. Instead, an alternative solution is that the low/hard state jet is dominated by pairs, so can be accelerated by lower fields. Strong toroidal fields could still stabilize the disk in the high/soft state if they are buried beneath the photosphere, though this seems unlikely due to magnetic buoyancy. Fundamentally, polarization data from IXPE mean that magnetic fields in black hole accretion flows are no longer invisible and unconstrained.

<title>Rethinking Thorne–Żytkow Object Formation: The Fate of X-Ray Binary LMC X-4 and Implications for Ultra-long Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a start-to-end simulation aimed at studying the long-term fate of high-mass X-ray binaries and whether a Thorne–Żytkow object (TŻO) might ultimately be assembled. We analyze results from a 3D hydrodynamical simulation that models the eventual fate of LMC X-4, a compact high-mass X-ray binary system, after the primary fills its Roche lobe and engulfs the neutron star companion. We discuss the outcome of this engulfment within the standard paradigm of TŻO formation. The post-merger angular momentum content of the stellar core is a key ingredient, as even a small amount of rotation can break spherical symmetry and produce a centrifugally supported accretion disk. Our findings suggest the inspiraling neutron star, upon merging with the core, can accrete efficiently via a disk at high rates (≈10−2M⊙ s−1), subsequently collapsing into a black hole and triggering a bright transient with a luminosity and duration typical of an ultra-long gamma-ray burst. We propose that the canonical framework for TŻO formation via common envelope needs to be revised, as the significant post-merger accretion feedback will unavoidably unbind the vast majority of the surrounding envelope.

<title>Radio Active Galactic Nuclei Activity in Low Redshift Galaxies Is Not Directly Related to Star Formation Rates</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8ac7</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8ac7</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We examine the demographics of radio-emitting active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the local Universe as a function of host galaxy properties, most notably both stellar mass (M⋆) and star formation rate (SFR). Radio AGN activity is theoretically implicated in helping reduce the SFR of galaxies, and therefore it is natural to investigate the relationship between these two galaxy properties. We use the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) optical IFU catalog in conjunction with the NVSS and Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty radio catalogs. MaNGA's high precision determinations of SFR allow us to impose a clean cut to reliably identify radio AGN from star formers. Using this sample of AGN, the well-measured stellar velocity dispersions from MaNGA, and the black hole M–σ relationship, we examine the Eddington ratio distribution (ERD) and its dependence on M⋆ and SFR. We find that the ERD depends strongly on M⋆, with more massive galaxies having larger Eddington ratios (λ). Interpreting our model fit to the data leads to a completeness-corrected estimate of FAGN(λ > 0.001), the fraction of galaxies with radio AGN with λ > 0.001. At , we estimate FAGN = 0.02. The AGN fraction increases rapidly with M⋆, and at , we estimate FAGN ∼ 0.24. We do not find any dependence on SFR, specific star formation rate, or velocity dispersion when controlling for stellar mass. We conclude that galaxy SFRs appear to be unrelated to the presence or absence of a radio AGN, which may be useful in constraining theoretical models of AGN feedback.

<title>An Empirical Framework Characterizing the Metallicity and Star-formation History Dependence of X-Ray Binary Population Formation and Emission in Galaxies</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8de7</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8de7</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a new empirical framework modeling the metallicity and star formation history (SFH) dependence of X-ray luminous (L ≳ 1036 erg s−1) point-source population X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) in normal galaxies. We expect that the X-ray point-source populations are dominated by X-ray binaries (XRBs), with contributions from supernova remnants near the low luminosity end of our observations. Our framework is calibrated using the collective statistical power of 3731 X-ray detected point sources within 88 Chandra-observed galaxies at D ≲ 40 Mpc that span broad ranges of metallicity (Z ≈ 0.03–2 Z⊙), SFH, and morphology (dwarf irregulars, late types, and early types). Our best-fitting models indicate that the XLF normalization per unit stellar mass declines by ≈2–3 dex from 10 Myr to 10 Gyr, with a slower age decline for low-metallicity populations. The shape of the XLF for luminous X-ray sources (L ≳ 1038 erg s−1) significantly steepens with increasing age and metallicity, while the lower-luminosity XLF appears to flatten with increasing age. Integration of our models provides predictions for X-ray scaling relations that agree very well with past results presented in the literature, including, e.g., the LX–SFR–Z relation for high-mass XRBs in young stellar populations as well as the LX/M⋆ ratio observed in early-type galaxies that harbor old populations of low-mass XRBs. The model framework and data sets presented in this paper further provide unique benchmarks that can be used for calibrating binary population synthesis models.

<title>A Dust Attenuation Model Inspired by the NIHAO-SKIRT-Catalog</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We use simulated attenuation curves from the NIHAO-SKIRT-Catalog to test the flexibility of commonly used dust attenuation models in the face of the variations expected from realistic star–dust geometries. Motivated by lack of flexibility in these existing models, we propose a novel dust attenuation model with three free parameters that can accurately recover the simulated attenuation curves as well as the best-fitting curves from the commonly used models. This new model is fully analytic and treats all starlight equally, in contrast to two-component dust attenuation models. We use the parameterization to investigate the relationship between the overall attenuation law shape and the strength of the 2175 Å bump. Our results indicate variation in star–dust geometry leads these features to correlate tightly, with grayer attenuation curves having weaker bumps.

<title>“SNe Ia Twins for Life”: Toward a Precise Determination of H 0</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad736d</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad736d</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Here we present an approach to the measurement of extragalactic distances using twin SNe Ia, taken from the early down to the nebular phase. The approach is purely empirical, although we can give a theoretical background on why the method is reliable. By studying those twins in galaxies where peculiar velocities are relatively unimportant, we can tackle the H0 tension problem. Here we apply the method to the determination of the distances to NGC 7250 and NGC 2525, who hosted, respectively, SN 2013dy and SN 2018gv, twins of two different SNe Ia prototypes: SN 2013aa/SN 2017cbv and SN 2011fe. From the study of the SN 2013aa and SN 2017cbv twin pair, by comparing it with SN 2011fe and applying the difference between the SN 2013aa/2017cbv and the SN 2011fe class, we also find a good estimate of the distance to NGC 5643. We have just started to measure distances with the method for the samples in W.L Freedman et al. and A. G. Riess et al. There are differences in measured distances to the same galaxy using Cepheids or TRGBs. In this context of discrepancy, the “twins for life” method is very competitive because it can provide distance estimates with a modulus error of σμ = 0.04 mag. Our findings called for a revision of the distances measured with Cepheids in A. G. Riess et al. (2022). NGC 7250 and NGC 2525 needed better measurements with Cepheids. We have noticed that the Cepheids-based distance obtained with the JWST in A. G. Riess et al. (2024a) for NGC 5643 is in good agreement with what we find, unlike their previous estimate in A. G. Riess et al. (2022). The Hubble tension can arise from the way in which the local SNe Ia sample is linked to the SNe Ia Hubble flow sample. A good calibration of SNe Ia in the local sample is needed and we have started to gather it. We also expect to apply the “twin” SNe Ia comparison from the local sample to that in galaxies with z >0.02–0.03 well into the Hubble flow to obtain a reliable value for H0. Those distant SNe Ia can be observed with the ELT or the JWST.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Differential Chromatic Refraction (DCR) is caused by the wavelength dependence of our atmosphere’s refractive index, which shifts the apparent positions of stars and galaxies and distorts their shapes depending on their spectral energy distributions. While this effect is typically mitigated and corrected for in imaging observations, we investigate how DCR can instead be used to our advantage to infer the redshifts of supernovae from multiband, time-series imaging data. We simulate Type Ia supernovae in the proposed Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time Deep Drilling Field, and evaluate astrometric redshifts. We find that the redshift accuracy improves dramatically with the statistical quality of the astrometric measurements as well as with the accuracy of the astrometric solution. For a conservative choice of a 5 mas systematic uncertainty floor, we find that our redshift estimation is accurate at z < 0.6. We then combine our astrometric redshifts with both host-galaxy photometric redshifts and supernovae photometric (light-curve) redshifts and show that this considerably improves the overall redshift estimates. These astrometric redshifts will be valuable, especially since Rubin will discover a vast number of supernovae for which we will not be able to obtain spectroscopic redshifts.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and Atacama Compact Array observations of atomic carbon ([C i](1–0)) and dust continuum in 10 enormous Lyα nebulae hosting ultraluminous Type-I QSOs at z = 2.2–2.5, as part of the Survey of Protocluster ELANe Revealing CO/C i in the Lyα Detected CGM. We detect [C i](1–0) and dust in all 10 QSOs and five companion galaxies. We find that the QSOs and companions have higher gas densities and more intense radiation fields than Luminous Infrared galaxies and high-z main sequence galaxies, with the highest values found in the QSOs. By comparing molecular gas masses derived from [C i](1–0), CO(4−3), and dust continuum, we find that the QSOs and companions display a similar low CO conversion factor of αCO ∼ 0.8 M☉ . After tapering our data to low resolution, the [C i](1–0) flux increases for nine QSOs, hinting at the possibility of [C i](1–0) in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) on a scale of 16−40 kpc. However, the [C i](1–0) sensitivity is too low to confirm this for individual targets, except for a tentative (2.7σ) CGM detection in Q0050+0051 with = (1.0–2.8) × 1010M☉. The 3σ mass limits of molecular CGM for the remaining QSO fields are (0.2–1.4) × 1010M☉. This translates into a baryon fraction of <0.4%–3% in the molecular CGM relative to the total baryonic halo mass. Our sample also includes a radio-detected active galactic nuclei, Q1416+2649, which shows [C i](1–0) and CO(4−3) luminosities an order of magnitude fainter for its far-infrared luminosity than other QSOs in our sample, possibly due to a lower molecular gas mass.

<title>GRB 211024B: An Ultra-long GRB Powered by Magnetar</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Ultra-long gamma-ray bursts are characterized by exceptionally long-duration central engine activities, with characteristic timescales exceeding 1000 s. We present ground-based optical afterglow observations of the ultra-long gamma-ray burst GRB 211024B, detected by Swift. Its X-ray light curve exhibits a characteristic “internal plateau” with a shallow decay phase lasting approximately ∼15 ks, followed by a steep decline (αdrop ∼ −7.5). Moreover, the early optical emission predicted by the late r-band optical afterglow is significantly higher than the observed value, indicating an external shock with energy injection. To explain these observations, we propose a magnetar central engine model. The magnetar collapses into a black hole due to spin-down or hyperaccretion, leading to the observed steep break in the X-ray light curve. The afterglow model fitting reveals that the afterglow injection luminosity varies with different assumptions of the circumburst medium density, implying different potential energy sources. For the interstellar medium case with a fixed injection end time, the energy may originate from the magnetar’s dipole radiation. However, in other scenarios, relativistic jets produced by the magnetar/black hole system could be the primary energy source.

<title>The Radio Spectra of High-luminosity Compact Symmetric Objects: Implications for Studies of Compact Jetted Active Galactic Nuclei</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This paper addresses, for the first time, a key aspect of the phenomenology of compact symmetric objects (CSOs): the characteristics of their radio spectra. We present a radio-spectrum description of a complete sample of high-luminosity CSOs (CSO-2s), which shows that they exhibit the complete range of spectral types, including flat-spectrum sources (α ≥ −0.5), steep-spectrum sources (α < −0.5), and peaked-spectrum sources. We show that there is no clear correlation between spectral type and size, but there is a correlation between the high-frequency spectral index and both object type and size. We also show that, to avoid biasing the data and to understand the various classes of active galactic nuclei (AGN) involved, the complete range of spectral types should be included in studying the general phenomenology of compact jetted AGN, and that complete samples must be used, selected over a wide range of frequencies. We discuss examples that demonstrate these points. We find that the high-frequency spectral indices of CSO-2s span −1.3 < αhi < −0.3 and hence that radio spectral signatures cannot be used to discriminate definitively between CSO-2s, binary galactic nuclei, and millilensed objects, unless they have αhi > −0.3.

<title>Realistic Outcomes of Moon–Moon Collisions in Lunar Formation Theory</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The multiple impact hypothesis proposes that the Moon formed through a series of smaller collisions, rather than a single giant impact. This study advances our understanding of this hypothesis, as well as moon collisions in other contexts, by exploring the implications of these smaller impacts, employing a novel methodological approach that combines self-consistent initial conditions, hybrid hydrodynamic/N-body simulations, and the incorporation of material strength. Our findings challenge the conventional assumption of perfect mergers in previous models, revealing a spectrum of collision outcomes including partial accretion and mass loss. These outcomes are sensitive to collision parameters and the Earth’s tidal influence, underscoring the complex dynamics of lunar accretion. Importantly, we demonstrate that incorporating material strength is important for accurately simulating moonlet-sized impacts. This inclusion significantly affects fragmentation, tidal disruption, and the amount of material ejected or accreted onto the Earth, ultimately impacting the Moon’s growth trajectory. By accurately modeling diverse collision outcomes, our hybrid approach provides a powerful new framework for understanding the Moon’s formation. We show that most collisions (≈90%) do not significantly erode the largest moonlet, supporting the feasibility of lunar growth through accretion. Moreover, we revise previous estimates of satellite disruption, suggesting a higher survival rate and further bolstering the multiple-impact scenario.

<title>Investigating Differences in the Palomar-Green Blazar Population Using Polarization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present polarization images with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in A- and B-array configurations at 6 GHz of seven radio-loud (RL) quasars and eight BL Lac objects belonging to the Palomar-Green (PG) “blazar” sample. This completes our arcsecond-scale polarization study of an optically selected volume-limited blazar sample comprising 16 radio-loud quasars and 8 BL Lac objects. Using the VLA, we identify kiloparsec-scale polarization in the cores and jets/lobes of all the blazars, with fractional polarization varying from around 0.8% ± 0.3% to 37% ± 6%. The kiloparsec-scale jets in PG RL quasars are typically aligned along their parsec-scale jets and show apparent magnetic fields parallel to jet directions in their jets/cores and magnetic field compression in their hot spots. The quasars show evidence of interaction with their environment as well as restarted active galactic nucleus activity through morphology, polarization, and spectral indices. These quasi-periodic jet modulations and restarted activity may be indicative of an unstable accretion disk undergoing transition. We find that the polarization characteristics of the BL Lacs are consistent with their jets being reoriented multiple times, with no correlation between their core apparent magnetic field orientations and parsec-scale jet directions. We find that the low synchrotron peaked BL Lacs show polarization and radio morphology features typical of “strong” jet sources as defined by E. T. Meyer et al. for the “blazar envelope scenario,” which posits a division based on jet profiles and velocity gradients rather than total jet power.

<title>Constraining the Excitation of Molecular Gas in Two Quasar-starburst Systems at z ∼ 6</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array observations of CO(8–7), (9–8), and (10–9) lines, as well as the underlying continuum for two far-infrared luminous quasars: SDSS J2054-0005 at z = 6.0389 and SDSS J0129-0035 at z = 5.7788. Both quasars were previously detected in CO (2–1) and (6–5) transitions, making them candidates for studying the CO spectral line energy distribution (SLED) of quasars at z ∼ 6. Utilizing the radiative transfer code CLOUDY, we fit the CO SLED with two heating mechanisms, including the photodissociation region (PDR) and X-ray-dominated region (XDR) for both objects. The CO SLEDs can be fitted by either a dense PDR component with an extremely strong far-ultraviolet radiation field (gas density nH ∼ 106 cm−3 and field strength G0 ≳ 106) or a two-component model including a PDR and an XDR. However, the line ratios, including LTIR and previous [C ii]158 μm and [C i]369 μm measurements, argue against a very high PDR radiation field strength. Thus, the results prefer a PDR+XDR origin for the CO SLED. The excitation of the high-J CO lines in both objects is likely dominated by the central active galactic nucleus (AGN). We then check the CO (9–8)-to-(6–5) line luminosity ratio r96 for all z ∼ 6 quasars with available CO SLEDs (seven in total) and find that there are no clear correlations between r96 and both LFIR and the AGN UV luminosities. This further demonstrates the complexity of the CO excitation powered by both the AGN and nuclear star formation in these young quasar host galaxies.

<title>Photochemical Hazes in Exoplanetary Skies with Diamonds: Microphysical Modeling of Haze Composition Evolution via Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8e67</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8e67</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Observational efforts in the last decade suggest the prevalence of photochemical hazes in exoplanetary atmospheres. Recent JWST observations raise growing evidence that exoplanetary hazes tend to have reflective compositions, unlike the conventionally assumed haze analogs, such as tholin and soot. In this study, I propose a novel hypothesis: diamond formation through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) may be happening in exoplanetary atmospheres. Using an aerosol microphysical model combined with the theory of CVD diamond and soot formation established in the industry community, I study how the haze composition evolves in exoplanetary atmospheres for various planetary equilibrium temperatures, atmospheric metallicity, and C/O ratio. I find that CVD diamond growth dominates over soot growth in a wide range of planetary parameters. Diamond haze formation is most efficient at Teq ∼ 1000 K and low atmospheric metallicity ([M/H] ≤ 2.0), while soot could be the main haze component only if the atmosphere is hot (Teq ≳ 1200 K) and carbon rich (C/O > 1). I also compute transmission, emission, and reflected light spectra, thereby suggesting possible observational signatures of diamond hazes, including the 3.53 μm feature of hydrogenated diamonds, anomalously faint thermal emission due to thermal scattering, and a drastic increase in geometric albedo. This study suggests that warm exoplanetary atmospheres may be favorable sites for forming CVD diamonds, which would be testable by future observations by JWST and Ariel as well as haze synthesis experiments under hot hydrogen-rich conditions.

<title>Theoretical Diagnostics for Narrow-line Regions of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Gas metallicity, ionization parameter, and gas pressure can affect the observed ratios of specific strong emission lines within galaxies. While the theoretical strong lines diagnostics for gas metallicity, ionization parameters, and gas pressure in star-forming regions are well-established, theoretical diagnostics for active galactic nuclei (AGNs) narrow-line regions are still lacking. In P. Zhu et al., we presented a new AGN model that provides the best predictions for observations spanning the UV, optical, and infrared wavelengths. This paper presents a suite of theoretical diagnostics for the gas metallicity, ionization parameter, gas pressure, and the peak energy in AGN ionizing radiation field Epeak for AGN narrow-line regions spanning the UV and optical wavelengths. We investigate the model dependency on the ionization parameter, gas pressure, Epeak, and the nitrogen scaling relation and make recommendations on metallicity diagnostics that are most robust against these parameters. We test our new AGN metallicity diagnostics using optical galaxy spectra from Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR16. These tests show that the metallicities measured from different diagnostics in this paper are consistent within ∼0.3 dex. We compare consistent H ii and AGN diagnostics and demonstrate that H ii and AGN diagnostics should not be used interchangeably. With a wide wavelength coverage, we anticipate that these AGN diagnostics will enable new metallicity studies of galaxies dominated by AGN.

<title>The Alignment of High-resolution Solar Prominence Images Observed by the New Vacuum Solar Telescope</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
High spatial resolution observation of solar prominence is an important observation subject of the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST). While the current level of observation and image reconstruction technologies for solar prominences are advanced, a significant challenge remains in achieving high-precision alignment among high-resolution prominence images observed at different times and different off-bands. Existing alignment approaches either become ineffective or yield low accuracy, and always require manual intervention during the alignment. These limitations are largely due to the stronger edge gradient and lower structural contrast of the prominence images compared with the solar surface ones. In response to this challenge, our study aims to develop an effective and robust algorithm for high-precision alignment of the prominence images. We thoroughly consider the unique structural characteristics of prominence images and the specific application conditions of various alignment algorithms. Consequently, we propose a comprehensive alignment method that incorporates the optical flow field of the solar surface, the gradient of the solar edge, and the cross-correlation within the solar prominence region. This method is designed to accurately determine the movement displacements among the prominence images. Our results demonstrate that this alignment method excels in both accuracy and robustness, making it well-suited for handling the diverse postures of solar prominence images captured by the NVST.

<title>Visual Orbits of Wolf–Rayet Stars. II. The Orbit of the Nitrogen-rich Wolf–Rayet Binary WR 138 Measured with the CHARA Array</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Classical Wolf–Rayet (WR) stars are descendants of massive OB-type stars that have lost their hydrogen-rich envelopes and are in the final stages of stellar evolution, possibly exploding as Type Ib/c supernovae. It is understood that the mechanisms driving this mass loss are either strong stellar winds and or binary interactions, so intense studies of these binaries including their evolution can tell us about the importance of the two pathways in WR formation. WR 138 (HD 193077) has a period of just over 4 yr and was previously reported to be resolved through interferometry. We report on new interferometric data combined with spectroscopic radial velocities in order to provide a three-dimensional orbit of the system. The precision on our parameters tend to be about an order of magnitude better than previous spectroscopic techniques. These measurements provide masses of the stars, namely, MWR = 13.93 ± 1.49 M⊙ and MO = 26.28 ± 1.71 M⊙. The derived orbital parallax agrees with the parallax from Gaia, namely, with a distance of 2.13 kpc. We compare the system’s orbit to models from BPASS, showing that the system likely may have been formed with little interaction but could have formed through some binary interactions either following or at the start of a red supergiant phase but with the most likely scenario occurring as the red supergiant phase starts for a ∼40 M⊙ star.

<title>High-precision Galaxy Clustering Predictions from Small-volume Hydrodynamical Simulations via Control Variates</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Cosmological simulations of galaxy formation are an invaluable tool for understanding galaxy formation and its impact on cosmological parameter inference from large-scale structures. However, their high computational cost is a significant obstacle for running simulations that probe cosmological volumes comparable to those analyzed by contemporary large-scale structure experiments. In this work, we explore the possibility of obtaining high-precision galaxy clustering predictions from small-volume hydrodynamical simulations such as MillenniumTNG and FLAMINGO via control variates. In this approach, the hydrodynamical full-physics simulation is paired with a matched low-resolution gravity-only simulation. By learning the galaxy–halo connection from the hydrodynamical simulation and applying it to the gravity-only counterpart, one obtains a galaxy population that closely mimics the one in the more expensive simulation. One can then construct an estimator of galaxy clustering that combines the clustering amplitudes in the small-volume hydrodynamical and gravity-only simulations with clustering amplitudes in a large-volume gravity-only simulation. Depending on the galaxy sample, clustering statistic, and scale, this galaxy clustering estimator can have an effective volume of up to around 100 times the volume of the original hydrodynamical simulation in the nonlinear regime. With this approach, we can construct galaxy clustering predictions from existing simulations that are precise enough for mock analyses of next-generation large-scale structure surveys such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time.

<title>Emergence of the Galaxy Morphology–Star Formation Activity–Clustercentric Radius Relations in Galaxy Clusters</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9276</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate when and how the relations of galaxy morphology and star-forming activity with clustercentric radius become evident in galaxy clusters. We identify 162 galaxy clusters with total mass at z = 0.625 in the Horizon Run 5 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation and study how the properties of the galaxies with stellar mass M* > 5 × 109M⊙ near the cluster main progenitors have evolved in the past. Galaxies are classified into disk, spheroid, and irregular morphological types according to the asymmetry and Sérsic index of their stellar mass distribution. We also classify galaxies into active and passive ones depending on their specific star formation rate. We find that the morphology–clustercentric radius relation (MRR) emerges at z ≃ 1.8 as the fraction of spheroidal types exceeds 50% in the central region (d ≲ 0.1R200). Galaxies outside the central region remain disk-dominated. Numerous encounters between galaxies in the central region seem to be responsible for the morphology transformation from disks to spheroids. We also find that the star formation activity–clustercentric radius relation emerges at an epoch different from that of MRR. At z ≃ 0.8, passive galaxies start to dominate the intermediate radius region (0.1 ≲ d/R200 ≲ 0.3), and this “quenching region” grows inward and outward thereafter. The region dominated by early-type galaxies (spheroids and passive disks) first appears at the central region at z ≃ 1.8, expands rapidly to larger radii as the population of passive disks grows in the intermediate radii, and clusters are dominated by early types after z ≃ 0.8.

<title>Shear Particle Acceleration in Structured Gamma-Ray Burst Jets. I. Physical Origin of the Band Function and Application to GRBs 090926A, 131108A, and 160509A</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The radiation physics of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains an open question. Based on the simulation analysis and recent observations, it was proposed that GRB jets are composed of a narrow ultrarelativistic core surrounded by a wide subrelativistic cocoon. We show that emission from the synchrotron radiations and the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) process of shear-accelerated electrons in the mixed jet-cocoon (MJC) region and internal-shock-accelerated electrons in the jet core is potentially explained the spectral characteristics of the prompt gamma rays. Assuming an exponential-decay velocity profile, the shear flow in the MJC region can accelerate electrons up to for injected electrons with γe,inject = 3 × 102 if its magnetic field strength ( ) is 100 G and its inner-edge velocity ( ) is 0.9 c. The cooling of these electrons is dominated by the SSC process, and the emission flux peaks at the keV band. In addition, the energy flux of synchrotron radiations of internal-shock-accelerated electrons (γe = 104 ∼ 105) peaks at around the keV−MeV band, assuming a bulk Lorentz factor of 300, a magnetic field strength of ∼106 G for the jet core. Adding the flux from both the jet core and the MJC region, the total spectral energy distribution illustrates similar characteristics as the broadband observations of GRBs. The bimodal and Band cut spectra observed in GRBs 090926A, 131108A, and 160509A can be well fit with our model. The derived varies from 54 G to 450 G and c.

<title>Synchrotron Break Frequencies of Mildly to Highly Relativistic Outflows Observed Off-axis</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9684</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We consider the synchrotron spectrum produced by mildly to highly relativistic collisionless shocks. Simple analytic formulae are derived for the break frequencies (peak frequency, self-absorption frequency, synchrotron, and inverse Compton cooling frequencies) of the emission produced by postshock plasma elements propagating at an angle θe relative to the observer’s line of sight. These formulae reproduce well the results of earlier exact analytic calculations valid for ultrarelativistic shocks and also hold for γ < 10 and for “off-axis” propagation (deviating from the ultrarelativistic results by approximately 1 order of magnitude). Our results will improve parameter estimation accuracy from future observations of synchrotron emission produced by collisionless shocks driven by the relativistic ejected material from compact object mergers and jetted tidal disruption events. The improved accuracy for mildly relativistic velocities is essential since most events will be observed off-axis, with γ < 10 outflows dominating the synchrotron emission (due to relativistic beaming). For GW170817, our results imply that (i) the Lorentz factor of the plasma emitting the observed radiation is bounded by 2.6 < γ at t ∼ 10 days and by γ < 12 at t > 16 days, (ii) the interstellar medium (ISM) density, n, and the fraction of internal energy density held by magnetic fields, εB, are bounded by n · εB ≲ 3 × 10−7 cm−3. In future merger events in higher-density ISM, the peak and cooling frequencies may be identified in the radio and X-ray bands; consequently, γ, n · εB could be measured as opposed to the case of GW170817, where these frequencies are out of the observable range.

<title>The Peak Frequency and Luminosity of Synchrotron Emitting Shocks: From Nonrelativistic to Ultrarelativistic Explosions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Synchrotron emission is ubiquitous in explosive astrophysical events—it is a natural byproduct of shocks formed when matter expelled by the explosion collides with ambient material. This emission is well observed in various classes of transients, and is often interpreted within a canonical “equipartition” framework that allows physical properties of the shock to be inferred from the frequency and luminosity at which the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) peaks. This framework has been remarkably successful in explaining observations of radio supernovae. It has also been used for transrelativistic explosions, where the shock velocities approach the speed of light. However, the conventional framework does not incorporate relativistic effects. Neither does it account for thermal electrons, which have been shown to be important for high-velocity shocks. In this paper we describe a revised framework that accounts for these two effects, and is applicable to nonrelativistic, transrelativistic, and ultrarelativistic explosions. We show that accounting for these effects can dramatically change the inferred parameters of high-velocity shocks, and, in particular, that the shock velocity, ambient density, and total energy are overestimated by the conventional nonrelativistic framework. We delineate the phase-space where such modifications are important in terms of observationally measurable parameters. We also find a novel upper limit on the peak synchrotron luminosity of shock-powered transients, which is remarkably consistent with existing observations. Finally, we discuss a prediction of the model—that the SED will qualitatively change as a function of shock velocity—and show that this is broadly consistent with data for representative events (e.g., SN1998bw, AT2018cow, CSS161010, AT2020xnd).

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We develop a robust machine learning classifier model utilizing the eXtreme-Gradient Boosting (XGB) algorithm for improved classification of Galactic Wolf–Rayet (WR) stars based on IR colors and positional attributes. For our study, we choose an extensive data set of 6555 stellar objects (from 2MASS and AllWISE data releases) lying in the Milky Way (MW) with available photometric magnitudes of different types, including WR stars. Our XGB classifier model can accurately (with an 86% detection rate) identify a sufficient number of WR stars against a large sample of non-WR sources. The XGB model outperforms other ensemble classifier models, such as Random Forest. Also, using the XGB algorithm, we develop a WR subtype classifier model that can differentiate the WR subtypes from the non-WR sources with a high model accuracy (>60%). Further, we apply both XGB-based models to a selection of 6457 stellar objects with unknown object types, detecting 58 new WR star candidates and predicting subtypes for 10 of them. The identified WR sources are mainly located in the local spiral arm of the MW and mostly lie in the solar neighborhood.

We examine lengthy radio light curves of the flat spectrum radio galaxy 3C 454.3 for possible quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs). The data used in this work were collected at five radio frequencies, 4.8, 8.0, 14.5, 22.0, and 37.0 GHz between 1979 and 2013 as observed at the University of Michigan Radio Astronomical Observatory, Crimean Astrophysical Observatory, and Aalto University Metsähovi Radio Observatory. We employ generalized Lomb–Scargle periodogram and weighted wavelet transform analyses to search for periodicities in these light curves. We confirm a QPO period of ∼2000 days to be at least 4σ significant using both methods at all five radio frequencies between 1979 and 2007, after which a strong flare changed the character of the light curve. We also find a ∼600 day period, which is at least 4σ significant, but only in the 22.0 and 37.0 GHz light curves. We briefly discuss physical mechanisms capable of producing such variations.

<title>CSS 161010: A Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transient with Broad Blueshifted Hydrogen Lines</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared photometric and optical spectroscopic observations of the luminous fast blue optical transient (LFBOT) CSS 161010:045834–081803 (CSS 161010). The transient was found in a low-redshift (z = 0.033) dwarf galaxy. The light curves of CSS 161010 are characterized by an extremely fast evolution and blue colors. The V-band light curve shows that CSS 161010 reaches an absolute peak of mag in 3.8 days from the start of the outburst. After maximum, CSS 161010 follows a power-law decline ∝t−2.8±0.1 in all optical bands. These photometric properties are comparable to those of well-observed LFBOTs such as AT 2018cow, AT 2020mrf, and AT 2020xnd. However, unlike these objects, the spectra of CSS 161010 show a remarkable transformation from a blue and featureless continuum to spectra dominated by very broad, entirely blueshifted hydrogen emission lines with velocities of up to 10% of the speed of light. The persistent blueshifted emission and the lack of any emission at the rest wavelength of CSS 161010 are unique features not seen in any transient before CSS 161010. The combined observational properties of CSS 161010 and its M* ∼ 108M⊙ dwarf galaxy host favor the tidal disruption of a star by an intermediate-mass black hole as its origin.

<title>Varying Activity and the Burst Properties of FRB 20240114A Probed with GMRT Down to 300 MHz</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad84de</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) can exhibit a wide range of burst repetition rates, from none to hundreds of bursts per hour. Here we report the detection and characteristics of 60 bursts from the recently discovered FRB 20240114A, observed with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope in the frequency ranges 300–500 MHz and 550–750 MHz. The majority of the bursts show narrow emission bandwidth with Δν/ν ∼ 10%. All of the bursts we detect are faint (<10 Jy ms) and thus probe the lower end of the energy distribution. We determine the rate function for FRB 20240114A at 400 MHz and downward drift rates at 400 and 650 MHz, and we discuss our measurements in the context of the repeating FRB population. We observe sudden variations in the burst activity of FRB 20240114A over time. From our data and the publicly available information on other observations of FRB 20240114A so far, there is an indication that FRB 20240114A potentially exhibits chromaticity in its burst activity. While the burst properties of FRB 20240114A are similar to other repeating FRBs, the frequency-dependent activity, if established, could provide crucial clues to the origin of repeating FRBs. We also place the most stringent 5σ upper limits of 600 and 89 μJy on any persistent radio source (PRS) associated with FRB 20240114A at 400 and 650 MHz, respectively, and compare these with the luminosity of the known PRSs associated with FRB 121102A and FRB 190520B.

<title>Semisupervised Learning for Detecting Inverse Compton Emission in Galaxy Clusters</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8888</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8888</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Inverse Compton (IC) emission associated with the nonthermal component of the intracluster medium (ICM) has been a long-sought phenomenon in cluster physics. Traditional spectral fitting often suffers from the degeneracy between the two-temperature thermal (2T) spectrum and the one-temperature plus IC power-law (1T+IC) spectrum. We present a semisupervised deep-learning approach to search for IC emission in galaxy clusters. We employ a conditional autoencoder (CAE), which is based on an autoencoder with latent representations trained to constrain the thermal parameters of the ICM. The algorithm is trained and tested using synthetic NuSTAR X-ray spectra with instrumental and astrophysical backgrounds included. The training data set only contains 2T spectra, which is more common than 1T+IC spectra. Anomaly detection is performed on the validation and test data sets consisting of 2T spectra as the normal set and 1T+IC spectra as anomalies. With a threshold anomaly score, chosen based on cross validation, our algorithm is able to identify spectra that contain an IC component in the test data set, with a balanced accuracy (BAcc) of 0.64, which outperforms traditional spectral fitting (BAcc = 0.55) and ordinary autoencoders (BAcc = 0.55). Traditional spectral fitting is better at identifying IC cases among true IC spectra (a better recall), while IC predictions made by CAE have a higher chance of being true IC cases (a better precision), demonstrating that they mutually complement each other.

<title>Radial Profiles of Σ*, ΣSFR, Gas Metallicity, and Their Correlations across the Galactic Mass–Size Plane</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8a61</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8a61</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We analyzed the global and resolved properties of approximately 1240 nearby star-forming galaxies from the MaNGA survey, comparing compact and extended galaxies—those with smaller and larger radii (Re), respectively—at a fixed stellar mass (M*). Compact galaxies typically exhibit lower H i gas fractions, higher dust extinction, higher metallicity, greater mass concentration, and lower angular momentum on a global scale. Radial profiles of stellar mass surface density (Σ*) and star formation rate surface density (ΣSFR) as functions of the effective radius (R/Re) reveal that compact galaxies display steeper gradients and higher values, resulting in elevated specific star formation rates (sSFRs) in their inner regions compared to their outskirts. At a given Σ*, compact galaxies have higher sSFRs than extended galaxies, particularly in low-mass galaxies (log(M*/M⊙) ≤ 1010). Additionally, their metallicity profiles differ significantly: extended galaxies have steeper metallicity gradients, while compact galaxies exhibit flatter slopes and higher metallicity at a given R/Re. After accounting for the dependence of metallicity on M* and Σ*, no further correlation with SFR is observed. The combination of higher sSFR and potentially higher star formation efficiency in compact galaxies suggests that their central gas is being rapidly consumed, leading to older stellar populations, as indicated by Dn(4000) and EW(HδA), and resulting in faster central growth. Our results reveal that radial SFR profiles cannot be fully determined by M* and Σ* alone; other factors, such as galaxy size or angular momentum, must be considered to fully understand the observed trends.

<title>Exploring the Diversity of Faint Satellites in the M81 Group</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8c3a</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8c3a</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In the last decade, we have been able to probe further down the galaxy luminosity function than ever before and expand into the regime of ultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs), which are some of the best probes we have of small-scale cosmology and galaxy formation. Digital sky surveys have enabled the discovery and study of these incredibly low-mass, highly dark-matter-dominated systems around the Local Group, but it is critical that we expand the satellite census further out to understand if Milky Way and M31 satellites are representative of dwarf populations in the local Universe. Using data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), we present updated characterization of four satellite systems in the M81 group. These systems—D1005+68, D1006+69, DWJ0954+6821, and D1009+68—were previously discovered using ground-based Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam data as overdensities in M81's halo, and are now confirmed with HST/ACS by this work. These are all faint (MV ≥ −7.9) and consistent with old (∼13 Gyr), metal-poor ([M/H] < −1.5) populations. Each system possesses relatively unusual features—including one of the most concentrated satellite galaxies with a Sérsic index of n ∼ 5, one of the most elliptical galaxies outside the Local Group with an ϵ ∼ 0.6, and one of the most compact galaxies for its magnitude. Two of the satellites have very low surface brightness, lower than most known galaxies in this absolute magnitude range. This work previews the scientific promise of the upcoming Rubin Observatory and Roman Telescope for illuminating the diversity of UFDs in the Local Volume and beyond.

<title>Unveiling the Emission Mechanisms of Blazar PKS 1510-089. I. Multiwavelength Variability</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8ddd</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8ddd</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The flat spectrum radio quasar PKS 1510-089 is one of the most active blazars in γ-rays, exhibiting phases of very high activity. This study investigates its variability over a decade across a wide range of wavelengths, from radio to γ-rays. Utilizing the nonthermal dominance parameter, we analyze the Hβ, Hγ, and λ5100 Å continuum light curves to discern the primary source of continuum emission, either from the accretion disk or the jet, during different activity phases. Our findings underscore the dominance of jet emission in the continuum during flare-like events. We observed an approximately 80 day delay between the Hβ and continuum emissions, which we attribute to the spatial separation between the optical emission zone and the broad-line region. Near-zero delays between optical and near-infrared emissions suggest that the emitting regions within the jet are cospatial. Synchrotron self-Compton was identified as the primary mechanism for γ-ray emission during flares, supported by the minimal delay observed between optical/near-infrared emissions and γ-rays. Additionally, we found a delay of about 60 days between the leading optical/near-infrared emissions and X-rays, indicating that inverse Compton scattering within the jet predominantly drives X-ray emission. However, distinguishing between synchrotron self-Compton and external inverse Compton mechanism was not feasible. Shifts in the spectral index across the 15–230 GHz range corresponded with ejections from the radio core, suggesting changes in the physical conditions of the jet.

<title>An Evaluation of Different Numerical Methods to Calculate the Pitch-angle Diffusion Coefficient from Full-orbit Simulations: Disentangling a Rope of Sand</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b4a</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The pitch-angle diffusion coefficient (PADC) quantifies the effect of pitch-angle scattering on charged particles propagating through turbulent magnetic fields and is a key ingredient in understanding the diffusion of these particles along the background magnetic field. Despite its significance, only a limited number of studies have calculated the PADC from test-particle simulations in synthetic magnetic turbulence, employing various, often quite different, techniques for this purpose. In this study, we undertake a comparative analysis of nine different methods for calculating the PADC from full-orbit simulations. Our objective is to find the strengths and limitations of each method and to determine the most reliable approach. Although all nine methods should theoretically yield comparable results, certain methods may be ill-suited for numerical investigations, while others may not be applicable under conditions of strong turbulence. Through this investigation, we aim to provide recommendations for best practices when employing these methods in future numerical studies of pitch-angle scattering.

<title>JWST/MIRI Detection of a Carbon-rich Chemistry in the Disk of a Solar Nebula Analog</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b4f</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b4f</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
It has been proposed, and confirmed by multiple observations, that disks around low-mass stars display a molecule-rich emission and carbon-rich disk chemistry as compared to their hotter, more massive solar counterparts. In this work, we present JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey MIRI-MRS observations of the solar-mass star DoAr 33, a low-accretion rate T Tauri star showing an exceptional carbon-rich inner disk. We report detections of H2O, OH, and CO2, as well as the more complex hydrocarbons, C2H2 and C4H2. Through the use of thermochemical models, we explore different spatial distributions of carbon and oxygen across the inner disk and compare the column densities and temperatures obtained from LTE slab model retrievals. We find the best match to the observed column densities with models that have carbon enrichment, and the retrieved emitting temperature and area of C2H2 with models that have C/O = 2–4 inside the 500 K carbon-rich dust sublimation line. This suggests that the origin of the carbon-rich chemistry is likely due to the sublimation of carbon-rich grains near the soot line. This would be consistent with the presence of dust processing as indicated by the detection of crystalline silicates. We propose that this long-lived hydrocarbon-rich chemistry observed around a solar-mass star is a consequence of the unusually low M-star-like accretion rate of the central star, which lengthens the radial mixing timescale of the inner disk, allowing the chemistry powered by carbon grain destruction to linger.

<title>SCExAO/CHARIS Near-infrared Scattered-light Imaging and Integral Field Spectropolarimetry of the AB Aurigae Protoplanetary System</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8ba0</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8ba0</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We analyze near-infrared integral field spectropolarimetry of the AB Aurigae protoplanetary disk and protoplanet (AB Aur b), obtained with SCExAO/CHARIS in 22 wavelength channels covering the J, H, and K passbands (λ0 = 1.1–2.4 μm) over angular separations of ρ ≈ 0.″13 to 1.″1 (∼20–175 au). Our images resolve spiral structures in the disk in each CHARIS channel. At the longest wavelengths, the data may reveal an extension of the western spiral seen in previous polarimetric data at ρ < 0.″3 out to larger distances clockwise from the protoplanet AB Aur b, coincident with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array–detected CO gas spiral. While AB Aur b is detectable in complementary total intensity data, it is a nondetection in polarized light at λ > 1.3 μm. While the observed disk color is extremely red across JHK, the disk has a blue intrinsic scattering color consistent with small dust grains. The disk’s polarization spectrum is redder than AB Aur b’s total intensity spectrum. The polarization fraction peaks at ∼0.6 along the major disk axis. Radiative transfer modeling of the CHARIS data shows that small, porous dust grains with a porosity of p = 0.6–0.8 better reproduce the scattered-light appearance of the disk than more compact spheres (p = 0.3), especially the polarization fraction. This work demonstrates the utility of integral field spectropolarimetry to characterize structures in protoplanetary disks and elucidate the properties of the disks’ dust.

<title>Low-latitude Auroras: Insights from 2023 April 23 Solar Storm</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8dd3</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8dd3</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In 2023 April, a low-latitude aurora observed by the all-sky camera at Hanle, Ladakh, India (33°14’N geographic latitude), generated significant interest. This was the first such aurora recorded from the Indian region in the space era and occurred during a moderate solar storm. This study explores this low-latitude auroral sighting, which happened during the sheath-region passage of an interplanetary coronal mass ejection. We analyze in situ multispacecraft particle measurements and geomagnetic field observations from both ground-based and satellite-based magnetometers. The auroral observations at Hanle coincided with intense substorm activity. Our findings indicate that the aurora did not actually reach India; the equatorward boundary was beyond 50°N geographic latitude. Enhanced electron fluxes with energies below 100 eV were detected at 54°N geographic latitude at about 830 km altitude in the predawn sector (4–5 hr local time). In the midnight sector, the equatorward boundary is estimated to be around 52°N geographic latitude, based on Hanle observations and considering emission altitudes of 600–650 km due to low-energy electrons. Thus, the low-latitude red aurora observed from India resulted from the emissions at higher altitudes due to low-energy electron precipitation in the auroral oval and a slight equatorward expansion of the auroral oval. The low-energy electrons likely originated from the plasma sheet and were precipitated due to enhanced wave–particle interactions from strong magnetosphere compression during high solar wind pressure. This study is crucial in understanding low-latitude auroras in the modern space era.

<title>Large Dark Matter Content and Steep Metallicity Profile Predicted for Ultradiffuse Galaxies Formed in High-spin Halos</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8de8</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8de8</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study the stellar properties of a sample of simulated ultradiffuse galaxies (UDGs) with stellar mass M⋆ = 107.5–109M⊙, selected from the TNG50 simulation, where UDGs form mainly in high-spin dwarf-mass halos. We divide our sample into star-forming and quenched UDGs, finding good agreement with the stellar assembly history measured in observations. Star-forming UDGs and quenched UDGs with M⋆ ≥ 108M⊙ in our sample are particularly inefficient at forming stars, having 2–10 times less stellar mass than non-UDGs for the same virial mass halo. These results are consistent with recent mass inferences in UDG samples and suggest that the most inefficient UDGs arise from a late assembly of the dark matter mass followed by a stellar growth that is comparatively slower (for star-forming UDGs) or that was interrupted due to environmental removal of the gas (for quenched UDGs). Regardless of efficiency, UDGs are 60% poorer in [Fe/H] than the population of non-UDGs at a fixed stellar mass, with the most extreme objects having metal content consistent with the simulated mass–metallicity relation at z ∼ 2. Quenched UDGs stop their star formation in shorter timescales than non-UDGs of similar mass and are, as a consequence, alpha enhanced with respect to non-UDGs. We identify metallicity profiles in UDGs as a potential avenue to distinguish between different formation paths for these galaxies, where gentle formation as a result of high-spin halos would present well-defined declining metallicity radial profiles while powerful-outflows or tidal stripping formation models would lead to flatter or constant metallicity as a function of radius due to the inherent mixing of stellar orbits.

<title>Artificial Polytropic Behavior of Plasmas Determined from the Application of Chi-squared Minimization Analysis to Data with Significant Statistical Uncertainty</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8f35</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The effective polytropic index of plasmas is typically determined from the analysis of the plasma temperature (or pressure) and density, which are plasma bulk parameters determined from analyses of in situ plasma observations. Here, we show that the use of the typical chi-squared minimization method in plasma observation analyses results in artificial correlations between the plasma density and temperature, which will introduce errors in the determination of the plasma polytropic relationship. We quantify this potential error by analyzing simulated plasma observations. We specifically show that even in cases of nonvarying plasma, a significant statistical uncertainty in the observations leads to the determination of plasma parameters, which seemingly follow a nearly adiabatic model. Moreover, we consider isobaric plasma variations and discuss the error in the determined polytropic relationship as a function of the actual plasma variations and the statistical uncertainties of the determined parameters. We finally show that the use of an alternative analysis method improves the accuracy of the results.

<title>On the Origins, Remnant, and Multimessenger Prospects of the Compact Binary Merger GW230529</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study investigates the origins of GW230529, delving into its formation from massive stars within isolated binary systems. Utilizing population-synthesis models, we present compelling evidence that the neutron star component forms second. However, the event’s low signal-to-noise ratio introduces complexities in identifying the underlying physical mechanisms driving its formation. Augmenting our analysis with insights from numerical relativity, we estimate the final black hole mass and spin to be approximately 5.3 M⊙ and 0.53, respectively. Furthermore, we employ the obtained posterior samples to calculate the ejecta mass and kilonova light curves resulting from r-process nucleosynthesis. We find the ejecta mass to be within 0–0.06 M⊙, contingent on the neutron star equation of state. The peak brightness of the kilonova light curves indicates that targeted follow-up observations with a Rubin-like observatory may have detected this emission.

<title>Size Growth on Short Timescales of Star-forming Galaxies: Insights from Size Variation with Rest-frame Wavelength with JADES</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad919a</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad919a</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate size variation with rest-frame wavelength for star-forming galaxies based on the second James Webb Space Telescope Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey data release. Star-forming galaxies are typically smaller at longer wavelengths from the UV to the near-IR at z < 3.5, especially for more massive galaxies, indicating the inside-out assembly with in situ star formation if ignoring dust attenuation. The size variation with wavelength shows a strong dependence on stellar mass and shows little or no dependence on redshift, specific star formation rate, and galaxy environment. This suggests that the size growth of star-forming galaxies is a self-regulated process primarily governed by stellar mass. We model size as a function of both mass and redshift simultaneously, obtaining at a wavelength of 0.45 μm, and at 1.0 μm. Based on this size evolution and the star formation main sequence from the literature, we obtain the locus of typical size growth for individual galaxies of different masses on the mass–size plane. The moving trend of galaxies on the mass–size plane, which indicates the slopes of their locus, strongly correlates with the size ratio between 0.45 μm and 1.0 μm, supporting the idea that the size variation with wavelength provides important information on the size growth of galaxies on short timescales.

<title>Investigation of the Nonthermal X-Ray Emission from the Supernova Remnant CTB 37B Hosting the Magnetar CXOU J171405.7-381031</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad938c</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a detailed X-ray investigation of a region (S1) exhibiting nonthermal X-ray emission within the supernova remnant (SNR) CTB 37B hosting the magnetar CXOU J171405.7−381031. Previous analyses modeled this emission with a power law (PL), inferring various values for the photon index (Γ) and absorbing column density (NH). Based on these, S1 was suggested to be an SNR shell, a background pulsar wind nebula, or an interaction region between the SNR and a molecular cloud. Our analysis of a larger data set favors a steepening (broken or curved PL) spectrum over a straight PL, with the best-fit broken power-law (BPL) parameters of Γ = 1.23 ± 0.23 and 2.24 ± 0.16 below and above a break at 5.57 ± 0.52 keV, respectively. However, a simple PL or srcut model cannot be definitively ruled out. For the BPL model, the inferred NH = (4.08 ± 0.72) × 1022 cm−2 towards S1 is consistent with that of the SNR, suggesting a physical association. The BPL-inferred spectral break ΔΓ ≈ 1 and hard Γ can be naturally explained by a nonthermal bremsstrahlung (NTB) model. We present an evolutionary NTB model that reproduces the observed spectrum, which indicates the presence of subrelativistic electrons within S1. However, alternate explanations for S1, an unrelated PWN or the SNR shock with unusually efficient acceleration, cannot be ruled out. We discuss these explanations and their implications for gamma-ray emission from CTB 37B and describe future observations that could settle the origin of S1.

<title>Complex Kinematics of Nebular Gas in Active Galaxies Centered in Cooling X-Ray Atmospheres</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
[O ii] emission maps obtained with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager are presented for four galaxies centered in cooling X-ray cluster atmospheres. Nebular emission extending over tens of kiloparsecs is found in systems covering a broad range of atmospheric cooling rates, cluster masses, and dynamical states. A262's central galaxy hosts a kiloparsec-scale disk. The nebular gas in RX J0820.9+0752 is offset and redshifted with respect to the central galaxy by 10–20 kpc and 150 km s−1, respectively. The nebular gases in PKS 0745−191 and A1835 are being churned to higher velocity dispersion by X-ray bubbles and jets. The churned gas is enveloped by larger-scale, lower-velocity-dispersion (quiescent) nebular emission. The mean line-of-sight speeds of the churned gas, quiescent gas, and the central galaxy each differ by up to ∼150 km s−1; nebular speeds upward of 800 km s−1 are found. Gases with outwardly rising speeds upward of several hundred kilometers per second are consistent with being advected behind and being lifted by the rising bubbles. The peculiar motion between the galaxy, nebular gas, and perhaps the hot atmosphere from which it presumably condensed is affecting the bubble dynamics and may strongly affect thermally unstable cooling, the dispersal of jet energy, and the angular momentum of gas accreting onto the galaxies and their nuclear black holes.

<title>Cosmic-Ray North–South Anisotropy: Rigidity Spectrum and Solar Cycle Variations Observed by Ground-based Muon Detectors</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8577</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The north–south (NS) anisotropy of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) is dominated by a diamagnetic drift flow of GCRs in the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), allowing us to derive key parameters of cosmic-ray propagation, such as the density gradient and diffusion coefficient. We propose a new method to analyze the rigidity spectrum of GCR anisotropy and reveal a solar cycle variation of the NS anisotropy’s spectrum using ground-based muon detectors in Nagoya, Japan, and Hobart, Australia. The physics-based correction method for the atmospheric temperature effect on muons is used to combine the different-site detectors free from local atmospheric effects. NS channel pairs in the multidirectional muon detectors are formed to enhance sensitivity to the NS anisotropy, and in this process, general graph matching in graph theory is introduced to survey optimized pairs. Moreover, Bayesian estimation with the Gaussian process allows us to unfold the rigidity spectrum without supposing any analytical function for the spectral shape. Thanks to these novel approaches, it has been discovered that the rigidity spectrum of the NS anisotropy is dynamically varying with solar activity every year. It is attributed to a rigidity-dependent variation of the radial density gradient of GCRs based on the nature of the diamagnetic drift in the IMF. The diffusion coefficient and mean free path length of GCRs as functions of the rigidity are also derived from the diffusion–convection flow balance. This analysis expands the estimation limit of the mean free path length into the ≤200 GV rigidity region from the <10 GV region achieved by solar energetic particle observations.

<title>The AH Pictoris Syndrome: Continuous Trains of Stunted Outbursts in Novalike Variables</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8c39</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Novalike variables are a subgroup of cataclysmic variables (CVs) that—unlike dwarf novae—do not exhibit strong brightenings in their long-term light curves. Variations over timescales of weeks, months, or years are mostly restricted to irregular low-amplitude modulations. However, some of them occasionally suffer from so-called stunted outbursts, that is, small-scale brightenings of less than a magnitude lasting for a couple of days to weeks. There is no consensus about the physical mechanisms behind these outbursts. Here I discuss the common properties of a group of novalike variables (which I call AH Pictoris (AH Pic) stars after its most prominent member) that exhibit a continuous train of successive stunted outbursts over their entire observational history, or at least for several years. The outburst amplitudes are stable in a given system, always ranging between 0.5 and 1 mag in the visual band. The outburst intervals, at an overall range between 12 and 30 days, and the outburst profiles can gradually evolve, but no sudden changes are observed. On shorter timescales the orbital waveforms are not only surprisingly similar, but also evolve in the same way over the outburst cycle. All AH Pic stars have absolute visual magnitudes in the overlap region between the absolute magnitudes of all novalike variables and of quiescent dwarf novae above the CV period gap. So far, I identified seven novalike variables with the consistent photometric behavior that may be termed the AH Pic syndrome. Several more systems may be related objects. The relationship of the AH Pic stars to the anomalous Z Cam stars is discussed.

<title>Insight-HXMT View of the Black Hole Candidate Swift J1727.8–1613 during Its Outburst in 2023</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The transient Galactic black hole candidate Swift J1727.8-1613 went through an outburst for the very first time in 2023 August and lasted for almost 6 months. We study the timing and spectral properties of this source using publicly available archival Insight-HXMT data for the first 10 observation IDs that last from MJD 60181 to 60198 with a total of 92 exposures for each of the three energy bands. We have detected quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in a frequency range of 0.21 ± 0.01–1.86 ± 0.01 Hz by fitting the power density spectrum. Based on the model-fitted parameters and properties of the QPOs, we classify them as type C in nature. We also conclude that the origin of the QPOs could be the shock instabilities in the transonic advective accretion flows around black holes. The spectral analysis was performed using simultaneous data from the three onboard instruments LE, ME, and HE of Insight-HXMT in the broad energy band of 2−150 keV. To achieve the best fit, spectral fitting required a combination of models, e.g., interstellar absorption, power-law, multicolor disk–blackbody continuum, Gaussian emission/absorption, and reflection by neutral material. From the spectral properties, we found that the source was in an intermediate state at the start of the analysis period and was transitioning to the softer states. The inner edge of the accretion disk moved inward in progressive days following the spectral nature. We found that the source has a high inclination of 78°−86°. The hydrogen column density from the model fitting varied in the range of (0.12 ± 0.02−0.39 ± 0.08) × 1022 cm−2.

<title>[X/Fe] Marks the Spot: Mapping Chemical Azimuthal Variations in the Galactic Disk with APOGEE</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Chemical cartography of the Galactic disk provides insights into its structure and assembly history over cosmic time. In this work, we use chemical cartography to explore chemical gradients and azimuthal substructure in the Milky Way disk with giant stars from Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) DR17. We confirm the existence of a radial metallicity gradient in the disk of Δ[Fe/H]/ΔR ∼ –0.0678 ± 0.0004 dex kpc−1 and a vertical metallicity gradient of Δ[Fe/H]/ΔZ ∼ −0.164 ± 0.001. We find azimuthal variations (±0.1 dex) on top of the radial metallicity gradient that have been previously established with other surveys. The APOGEE giants show strong correlations with stellar age and the intensity of azimuthal variations in [Fe/H]; young populations and intermediate-aged populations both show significant deviations from the radial metallicity gradient, while older stellar populations show the largest deviations from the radial metallicity gradient. Beyond iron, we show that other elements (e.g., Mg, O) display azimuthal variations at the ±0.05 dex level across the Galactic disk. We illustrate that moving into the orbit-space could help constrain the mechanisms producing these azimuthal metallicity variations in the future. These results suggest that dynamical processes play an important role in the formation of azimuthal metallicity variations.

<title>Kinematic Analysis of z = 4.3 Galaxies in the SPT2349–56 Protocluster Core</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
SPT2349−56 is a protocluster discovered in the 2500 deg2 South Pole Telescope (SPT) survey. In this paper, we study the kinematics of the galaxies found in the core of SPT2349−56 using high-resolution (1.55 kpc spatial resolution at z = 4.303) redshifted [C ii] 158 μm data. Using the publicly available code 3DBAROLO, we analyze the seven far-infrared brightest galaxies within the protocluster core. Based on conventional definitions for the detection of rotating disks, we classify six sources to be rotating disks in an actively star-forming protocluster environment, with weighted mean Vrot/σdisp = 4.5 ± 1.3. The weighted mean rotation velocity (Vrot) and velocity dispersion (σdisp) for the sample are 357.1 ± 114.7 km s−1 and 43.5 ± 23.5 km s−1, respectively. We also assess the disk stability of the galaxies and find a mean Toomre parameter of QT = 0.9 ± 0.3. The galaxies show a mild positive correlation between disk stability and dynamical support. Using the position–velocity maps, we find that five sources further classify as disturbed disks, and one classifies as a strictly rotating disk. Our sample joins several observations at similar redshift with high V/σ values, with the exception that they are morphologically disturbed, kinematically rotating, and interacting galaxies in an extreme protocluster environment.

<title>Plasma Waves Can Gain Energy from Neutrals in Partially Ionized Plasmas</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Partially ionized plasmas are widely present in astrophysical and space plasmas, and ion-neutral collisions have an important impact on the plasma dynamics, such as electrostatic wave propagation. In this work, the excitation and propagation characteristics of electrostatic ion cyclotron (EIC) waves were experimentally studied in a partially ionized plasma. The EIC waves were launched via a grid antenna, and two types of EIC waves were observed to be excited and propagated. In partially ionized plasmas with weak ion–neutral collisions, it was found that the EIC wave propagation is dominated by ion motion, resembling the classical EIC wave. However, in plasmas with strong ion–neutral collisions, experiments revealed for the first time that EIC wave propagation can be dominated by neutral motion, which leads to an increase in the collisional EIC wave’s phase velocity. Additionally, the EIC wave dispersion relationships under collisions were determined to reveal the underlying processes responsible for the observations. This work verified that collisional EIC waves can gain energy from neutrals in partially ionized plasmas, which suggests that ion‒neutral collisions in the Earth and planetary ionosphere and solar atmosphere have a more complex impact on plasma wave propagation than previously thought.

<title>Cross-correlation of Luminous Red Galaxies with Machine Learning Selected Active Galactic Nuclei in HSC-SSP: Unobscured AGN Residing in More Massive Halos</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are the signposts of black hole growth, and likely play an important role in galaxy evolution. An outstanding question is whether AGN of different spectral types indicate different evolutionary stages in the coevolution of black holes and galaxies. We present the angular correlation function between an AGN sample selected from Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) optical photometry and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer mid-IR photometry and a luminous red galaxy (LRG) sample from HSC-SSP. We investigate AGN clustering strength as a function of luminosity and spectral features across three independent HSC fields totaling ∼600 deg2, for z ∈ 0.6 −1.2 and AGN with L6 μm > 3 × 1044 erg s−1. There are ∼28,500 AGN and ∼1.5 million LRGs in our primary analysis. We determine the average halo mass for the full AGN sample (Mh ≈ 1012.9 h−1M⊙), and note that it does not evolve significantly as a function of redshift (over this narrow range) or luminosity. We find that, on average, unobscured AGN (Mh ≈ 1013.3 h−1M⊙) occupy ∼4.5× more massive halos than obscured AGN (Mh ≈ 1012.6 h−1M⊙), at 5σ statistical significance using 1D uncertainties, and at 3σ using the full covariance matrix, suggesting a physical difference between unobscured and obscured AGN, beyond the line-of-sight viewing angle. Furthermore, we find evidence for a halo mass dependence on reddening level within the Type I AGN population, which could support the existence of a dust-obscured phase. However, we also find that quite small systematic shifts in the redshift distributions of the AGN sample could explain current and previously observed differences in Mh.

<title>Modeling Multiple X-Ray Reflection in Super-Eddington Winds</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
It has been recently discovered that a few super-Eddington sources undergoing black hole super-Eddington accretion exhibit X-ray reflection signatures. In such new systems, one expects the coronal X-ray emissions to be mainly reflected by optically thick super-Eddington winds instead of thin disks. In this paper, we conduct a series of general-relativistic ray-tracing and Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations to model the X-ray reflection signatures, especially the characteristic Fe Kα line, produced from super-Eddington accretion flows around nonspinning black holes. In particular, we allow the photons emitted by a lamppost corona to be reflected multiple times in a cone-like funnel surrounded by fast winds. We find that the Fe Kα line profile most sensitively depends on the wind kinematics, while its exact shape also depends on the funnel open angle and corona height. Furthermore, very interestingly, we find that the Fe Kα line can have a prominent double-peak profile in certain parameter spaces, even with a face-on orientation. Moreover, we compare the Fe Kα line profiles produced from super-Eddington and thin disks and show that such lines can provide important insights into the understanding of black hole systems undergoing super-Eddington accretion.

<title>A Case Study of Gas Impacted by Black-hole Jets with the JWST: Outflows, Bow Shocks, and High Excitation of the Gas in the Galaxy IC 5063</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present James Webb Space Telescope MIRI data of the inner ∼3 × 2 kpc2 of the galaxy IC 5063, in which the jets of a supermassive black hole interact with the gaseous disk they are crossing. Jet-driven outflows were known to be initiated along or near the jet path and to modify the stability of molecular clouds, possibly altering their star formation properties. The MIRI data, of unprecedented resolution and sensitivity in the infrared, now reveal that there are more than 10 discrete regions with outflows, nearly doubling the number of such known regions. Outflows exist near the radio lobes, at the nucleus, in a biconical structure perpendicular to the jet, and in a bubble moving against the disk. In some of them, velocities above escape velocity are observed. Stratification is also observed, with higher ionization or excitation gas attaining higher velocities. More outflows and bow shocks, found further away from the nucleus than the radio lobes, in regions without significant radio emission, reveal the existence of past or weak radio jets that interacted with the interstellar medium. The coincidence of the bow shocks with the optical extended emission line region (EELR) suggests that the jets also contributed to the gas ionization. Maps of the H2 gas excitation temperature, Tex, indicate that the molecular gas is most excited in regions with radio emission. There, Tex is >100 K higher than in the EELR interior. We argue that a combination of jet-related shocks and cosmic rays is likely responsible for this excess molecular gas excitation.

<title>Temporal and Spectral Analysis of the Unique and Second-brightest Gamma-Ray Burst GRB 230307A: Insights from GECAM and Fermi/GBM Observations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this study, we present the pulse profile of the unique and the second-brightest gamma-ray burst GRB 230307A, and analyze its temporal behavior using a joint GECAM–Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) time-resolved spectral analysis. The utilization of GECAM data is advantageous as it successfully captured significant data during the pileup period of the Fermi/GBM. We investigate the evolution of its flux, photon fluence, photon flux, peak energy, and the corresponding hardness–intensity and hardness–flux correlations. The findings within the first 27 s exhibit consistent patterns reported previously, providing valuable insights for comparing observations with predictions from the synchrotron radiation model invoking an expanding shell. Beyond the initial 27 s, we observe a notable transition in the emitted radiation, attributed to high-latitude emission, influenced by the geometric properties of the shells and the relativistic Doppler effects. By modeling the data within the framework of the large-radius internal shock model, we discuss the required parameters as well as the limitations of the model. We conclude that a more complicated synchrotron emission model is needed to fully describe the observational data of GRB 230307A.

<title>Deep Einstein@Home Search for Continuous Gravitational Waves from the Central Compact Objects in the Supernova Remnants Vela Jr. and G347.3-0.5 Using LIGO Public Data</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b9e</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We perform a search for continuous nearly monochromatic gravitational waves from the central compact objects associated with the supernova remnants Vela Jr. and G347.3. Over 1018 different waveforms are considered, covering signal frequencies between 20 and 1300 Hz (20 and 400 Hz) for G347.3-0.5 (Vela Jr.) and a very broad range of frequency derivatives. The data set used for this first search is from the second observing run of LIGO (O2). Thousands of volunteers donating compute cycles through the computing project Einstein@Home have made this endeavor possible. Following the Einstein@Home search, we perform multistage follow-ups of over 5 million waveforms. The threshold for selecting candidates from the Einstein@Home search is such that, after the multistage follow-up, we do not expect any surviving candidate due to noise. The very last stage uses a different data set, namely, the LIGO O3 data. We find no significant signal candidate for either targets. Based on this null result, for G347.3-0.5, we set the most constraining upper limits to date on the amplitude of gravitational-wave signals, corresponding to deformations below 10−6 in a large part of the search band. At the frequency of best strain sensitivity, near 161 Hz, we set 90% confidence upper limits on the gravitational-wave intrinsic amplitude of . Over most of the frequency range, our upper limits are a factor of 10 smaller than the indirect age-based upper limit. For Vela Jr., near 163 Hz, we set . Over most of the frequency range, our upper limits are a factor of 15 smaller than the indirect age-based upper limit. The Vela Jr. upper limits presented here are slightly less constraining than the most recent upper limits of R. Abbott et al., but they apply to a broader set of signals.

<title>SN 2021foa: The “Flip-flop” Type IIn/Ibn Supernova</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8cd3</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8cd3</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a comprehensive analysis of the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of SN 2021foa, unique among the class of transitional supernovae for repeatedly changing its spectroscopic appearance from hydrogen-to-helium-to-hydrogen dominated (IIn-to-Ibn-to-IIn) within 50 days past peak brightness. The spectra exhibit multiple narrow (≈300–600 km s−1) absorption lines of hydrogen, helium, calcium, and iron together with broad helium emission lines with a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of ∼6000 km s−1. For a steady, wind mass-loss regime, light-curve modeling results in an ejecta mass of ∼8 M⊙ and circumstellar material (CSM) mass below 1 M⊙, and an ejecta velocity consistent with the FWHM of the broad helium lines. We obtain a mass-loss rate of ≈2 M⊙ yr−1. This mass-loss rate is 3 orders of magnitude larger than derived for normal Type II supernovae. We estimate that the bulk of the CSM of SN 2021foa must have been expelled within half a year, about 12 yr ago. Our analysis suggests that SN 2021foa had a helium-rich ejecta that swept up a dense shell of hydrogen-rich CSM shortly after explosion. At about 60 days past peak brightness, the photosphere recedes through the dense ejecta-CSM region, occulting much of the redshifted emission of the hydrogen and helium lines, which results in an observed blueshift (∼−3000 km s−1). Strong mass-loss activity prior to explosion, such as those seen in SN 2009ip-like objects and SN 2021foa as precursor emission, are the likely origin of a complex, multiple-shell CSM close to the progenitor star.

<title>Weighing Single-lined Spectroscopic Binaries Using Tidal Effects on Radial Velocities: The Case of V723 Monocerotis</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8cdd</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8cdd</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In single-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB1s) where flux variations due to tidal deformation of the primary star (ellipsoidal variations, EVs) are detected, the binary mass can be determined by combining EVs with the primary's radial velocity (RV) variations from orbital motion and information about the primary’s radius. This method has been used for mass estimation in close binaries including X-ray systems, but it has been pointed out that contaminating light from sources other than the primary star could introduce systematic errors in the mass and inclination estimates. Here, we focus on the apparent RV variations caused by asymmetric distortion of the absorption lines of the tidally deformed primary star (tidal RV). Because this signal contains information equivalent to that from photometric EVs, it enables mass estimation of the binary system using only the primary star’s absorption lines from high-resolution spectroscopic data, providing a potentially more robust approach against contaminating light. We apply the method to the binary system V723 Monocerotis, where both photometric EV and tidal RV signals are detected and successfully determine the component masses using only the primary star’s RVs and projected rotational velocity, without relying on absolute flux measurements or stellar evolutionary models. The masses derived from the tidal RV model shows a reasonable agreement with those obtained from EVs after carefully modeling the flux contamination from the secondary. This result demonstrates that tidal RVs provide a useful alternative means for mass estimation in SB1s.

<title>Global Simulation of the Solar Wind: A Comparison with Parker Solar Probe Observations during 2018–2022</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8d54</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8d54</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models play an important role in the infrastructure of space weather forecasting. Validating such models commonly utilizes in situ solar wind measurements made near the Earth’s orbit. The purpose of this study is to test the performance of G3DMHD (a data driven, time-dependent, 3D MHD model of the solar wind) with Parker Solar Probe (PSP) measurements. Since its launch in 2018 August, PSP has traversed the inner heliosphere at different radial distances sunward of the Earth (the closest approach ∼13.3 R⊙), thus providing a good opportunity to study evolution of the solar wind and to validate heliospheric models of the solar wind. The G3DMHD model simulation is driven by a sequence of maps of the photospheric field extrapolated to the assumed source surface (2.5 R⊙) using the potential field model from 2018 to 2022, which covers the first 15 PSP orbits. The Pearson correlation coefficient (cc) and the mean absolute scaled error (MASE) are used as the metrics to evaluate the model performance. It is found that the model performs better for both magnetic intensity (cc = 0.75; MASE = 0.60) and the solar wind density (cc = 0.73; MASE = 0.50) than for the solar wind speed (cc = 0.15; MASE = 1.29) and temperature (cc = 0.28; MASE = 1.14). This is due primarily to lack of accurate boundary conditions. The well-known underestimate of the magnetic field in solar minimum years is also present. Assuming that the radial magnetic field becomes uniformly distributed with latitude at or below 18 R⊙ (the inner boundary of the computation domain), the agreement in the magnetic intensity significantly improves (cc = 0.83; MASE = 0.49).

<title>Supernova Shocks in Molecular Clouds: Shocks Driven into Dense Cores in IC 443 and 3C 391</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Supernova shocks into dense molecular cores in IC 443 (clumps B, C, and G) and 3C 391 were observed using the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy and complemented by archival data from the Herschel Space Observatory. The pure rotational transitions 0–0 S(1) and S(5) of H2, and the ground-state 110–101 transition of H2O, are all broadened, arising from molecules that survive the passage of the shock front. Theoretical models from the Paris–Durham shock code were analyzed to generate velocity profiles that approximately match the observations. The observations can be fit with two shock conditions, which approximate the range of densities in the preshock molecular cloud. The width and brightness of the S(5) lines require shocks into gas with a density of order 2000 cm−3, into which the IC 443 blast wave drives shocks with speed 60 km s−1. The brightness and narrower width of the S(1) lines requires different shocks, into gas with density of order 105 cm−3, with shock speeds of 10 km s−1. The H2O velocity distribution is also consistent with these shocks. The existence of shocks into dense gas shows that the bright shocked clumps in IC 443 were prestellar cores. It is unlikely that they will form stars soon after the passage of the shock front, given the input of kinetic and thermal energy from the shocks.

The near-horizon region of a black hole impacts linear (LP) and circular polarization (CP) through strong lensing of photons, adding large-scale symmetries and anti-symmetries to the polarized image. To probe the signature of lensing in polarimetry, we utilize a geometric model of concentric Gaussian rings of equal radius to investigate the transition in the Fourier plane at which the photon ring signal begins to dominate over the direct image. We find analytic, closed-form expressions for the transition radii in total intensity, LP, and CP, wherein the resultant formulae are composed of ratios of tunable image parameters, with the overall “scale” set primarily by the thickness of the direct image. Using these formulae, we compute the transition radii for time-averaged images of M87* simulations at 230 GHz, studying both magnetically arrested disk (MAD) and standard and normal evolution configurations for various spin and electron heating models. We compare geometric values to radii obtained directly from the simulations through a coherent averaging scheme. We find that nearly all MAD models have a photon ring-dominated CP signal on long baselines shorter than Earth's diameter at 230 GHz. Across favored models for the M87* accretion flow identified by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) polarimetric constraints, we quantify the sensitivity and antenna size requirements for the next-generation EHT and the Black Hole Explorer orbiter to detect these features. We find that the stringent requirements for CP favor explorations using long baselines on the ground, while LP remains promising on Earth-space baselines.

<title>Proton Acceleration in Low-β Magnetic Reconnection with Energetic Particle Feedback</title>

Magnetic reconnection regions in space and astrophysics are known as active particle acceleration sites. There is ample evidence showing that energetic particles can take a substantial amount of converted energy during magnetic reconnection. However, there has been a lack of studies understanding the backreaction of energetic particles at magnetohydrodynamical scales in magnetic reconnection. To address this, we have developed a new computational method to explore the feedback by nonthermal energetic particles. This approach considers the backreaction from these energetic particles by incorporating their pressure into magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. The pressure of the energetic particles is evaluated from their distribution evolved through Parker’s transport equation, solved using stochastic differential equations (SDEs), so we coin the name MHD-SDE. Applying this method to low-β magnetic reconnection simulations, we find that reconnection is capable of accelerating a large fraction of energetic particles that contain a substantial amount of energy. When the feedback from these particles is included, their pressure suppresses the compression structures generated by magnetic reconnection, thereby mediating particle energization. Consequently, the feedback from energetic particles results in a steeper power-law energy spectrum. These findings suggest that feedback from nonthermal energetic particles plays a crucial role in magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration.

<title>Formation of Sub-Chandrasekhar-mass Black Holes and Red Stragglers via Hawking Stars in Ultrafaint Dwarf Galaxies</title>

Primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid mass window from 10−16M⊙ to 10−10M⊙ are currently a popular dark matter candidate. If they exist, some stars would capture them upon formation, and they would slowly accrete the star over gigayears. Such Hawking stars—stars with a central PBH—provide a novel channel for the formation of both sub-Chandrasekhar-mass black holes and red straggler stars. Here we report on stellar evolution models that extend our previous work to Hawking stars with masses between 0.5 and 1.4 M⊙. We explore three accretion schemes, and find that a wide range of PBHs in the asteroid mass window can robustly accrete stars as small as 1 M⊙ within the age of the Universe. This mechanism of producing subsolar-mass black holes is highly dependent on the assumed accretion physics and stellar metallicity. Lower-metallicity stars are generally accreted more rapidly, suggesting that it may be more likely for sub-Chandrasekhar-mass Hawking stars formed in the early Universe, such as those in ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxies, to transmute their star into a sub-Chandrasekhar-mass black hole within a Hubble time. We present a stellar population synthesis of a Draco II–like UFD galaxy containing Hawking stars and show that the number of red stragglers they produce can qualitatively match the observed population for black hole seed masses around 10−11M⊙ and under the assumption that they accrete with high radiative efficiency.

Proxima Cen (GJ 551; dM5.5e) is one of only about a dozen fully convective stars known to have a stellar cycle, and the only one to have long-term X-ray monitoring. A previous analysis found that X-ray and mid-UV observations, particularly two epochs of data from Swift, were consistent with a well-sampled ∼7 yr optical cycle seen in All Sky Automated Survey project (ASAS) data, but not convincing by themselves. The present work incorporates several years of new ASAS-SN optical data and an additional 5 yr of Swift XRT and UVOT observations, with Swift observations now spanning 2009–2021 and optical coverage from late 2000. X-ray observations by XMM-Newton and Chandra are also included. Analysis of the combined data, which includes modeling and adjustments for stellar contamination in the optical and UV, now reveals clear cyclic behavior in all three wavebands with a period of 8.0 yr. We also show that UV and X-ray intensities are anticorrelated with optical brightness variations caused by the cycle and by rotational modulation, discuss possible indications of two coronal mass ejections, and provide updated results for the previous finding of a simple correlation between X-ray cycle amplitude and Rossby number over a wide range of stellar types and ages.

<title>Center-to-limb Variations in Solar Plage Using IRIS Observations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad901d</link>

The center-to-limb variations (CLV) of transition region line Gaussian fit parameters in solar plage are reported for the first time. The Si iv 1402.77 Å line observed by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph is used. The spectral intensity increases linearly from the disk center to the solar limb. Similarly, the nonthermal velocity also increases linearly from 23.6 (at the disk center) to 30.9 km s−1 (at the solar limb). On the other hand, the Doppler velocity decreases from 8.9 ± 1.0 at the disk center to 0.0 km s−1 at the limb. This CLV pattern in solar plages is consistent with the CLV pattern reported in the quiet Sun (QS). However, the average values of the parameters in the solar plage are significantly higher than in the QS. The intensity and nonthermal velocity increase linearly with the magnetic field at the disk center, while the Doppler velocity does not depend on the magnetic field. Due to the line-of-sight effect, the plasma column depth increases toward the solar limb, which leads to a linear increase in the spectral intensity. Further, the increasing plasma column depth toward the solar limb adds more and more unresolved motions, and as a result, the nonthermal velocity increases from the disk center to the solar limb. In the solar plages, the higher plasma density due to the strong magnetic field leads to higher intensity and nonthermal velocity compared to the QS and coronal hole.

<title>A Compact, Coherent Representation of Stellar Surface Variation in the Spectral Domain</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Time-varying inhomogeneities on stellar surfaces constitute one of the largest sources of radial velocity (RV) error for planet detection and characterization. We show that stellar variations, because they manifest on coherent, rotating surfaces, give rise to changes that are complex but usably compact and coherent in the spectral domain. Methods for disentangling stellar signals in RV measurements benefit from modeling the full domain of spectral pixels. We simulate spectra of spotted stars using starry and construct a simple spectrum projection space that is sensitive to the orientation and size of stellar surface features. Regressing measured RVs in this projection space reduces RV scatter by 60%–80% while preserving planet shifts. We note that stellar surface variability signals do not manifest in spectral changes that are purely orthogonal to a Doppler shift or exclusively asymmetric in line profiles; enforcing orthogonality or focusing exclusively on asymmetric features will not make use of all the information present in the spectra. We conclude with a discussion of existing and possible implementations on real data based on the presented compact, coherent framework for stellar signal mitigation.

Free–free Gaunt factors for X-ray absorption by hot plasma in the presence of a strong magnetic field are reported. Modified formulae are used for application to the nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium conditions found in accreting pulsar atmospheres. Given upcoming global X-ray polarimetric space missions, these can be used for the construction of an absorption matrix in discrete-ordinate polarized radiative transfer.

<title>Revisiting the Activity–Rotation Relation for Evolved Stars</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The magnetic dynamo mechanism of giant stars remains an open question, which can be explored by investigating their activity–rotation relations with multiple proxies. By using the data from the LAMOST and Galaxy Evolution Explorer surveys, we carried out a comprehensive study of activity–rotation relations of evolved stars based on Ca ii H and K lines, Hα lines, and near-ultraviolet (NUV) emissions. Our results show that evolved stars and dwarfs obey a similar power law in the unsaturated region of the activity–rotation relation, indicating a common dynamo mechanism in both giants and dwarfs. There is no clear difference in the activity levels between red giant branch stars and red clump stars, nor between single giants and those in binaries. Additionally, our results show that the NUV activity levels of giants are comparable to those of G- and K-type dwarfs and are higher than those of M dwarfs.

<title>A Study of Slow-mode Shocks in the Near-Earth Magnetotail with MMS Observations and Hybrid Simulations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The structure of the magnetic reconnection boundary, particularly the presence of slow-mode shocks in the near-Earth magnetotail was studied by using magnetospheric multiscale (MMS) observations and 2.5D hybrid simulations. A total of 51 crossings of MMS from 2017 to 2021 were analyzed. We found that the detection percentage of slow-mode shocks in the near-Earth magnetotail is 41%–55%. Previous studies have only reported one slow-mode shock event in the near-Earth magnetotail and a slow-mode shock detection percentage of 10% or lower in the mid-to-distant magnetotail. It was observed that if the high-energy beam region data is removed from the slow-mode shock downstream observations then the detection of slow-mode shocks reduces, implying that the kinetic effects play an important role in the detection of slow-mode shocks. For the crossings where the interface was not identified as a slow-mode shock, it was found that the turbulence in those crossings can change the mass flux values and disrupt the detection of slow-mode shock. However, the macroscopic slow-mode shock-like structure stably exists around the magnetic reconnection interface, as most of the conditions for slow-mode shocks were satisfied. This result suggests that slow-mode shocks are a general feature of magnetic reconnection geometry. We find that the lack of detection of slow-mode shocks in previous observations and simulations can be explained by taking into account the kinetic structure of slow-mode shocks and the presence of turbulence.

<title>First Comparison of FLARIX Simulations with MSDP Observation of the C1.6 Solar Flare in the Hα Line of Hydrogen</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The primary objective of this study is to develop a time-dependent model of the flaring atmosphere based on observational data. Here, we present, for the first time, a comparison between numerical simulations of the flaring emission, specifically focusing on the hydrogen Hα line, utilizing the FLARIX code and spectral observations of a compact C1.6 GOES-class flare observed on 2012 September 10, by the MSDP imaging spectrograph installed at the Białków Observatory. The Multichannel Subtractive Double Pass imaging spectrograph spectral data, collected with a temporal resolution as fine as 50 ms, enabled a comprehensive analysis of Hα line profiles and light curves measured within an area of the flare’s emission. An initial atmospheric model close to VAL-C, with a modified temperature in the upper chromosphere, was employed in simulations. To enhance temporal resolution, modulations of the nonthermal electron (NTE) beam’s parameters were introduced based on variations in observed hard X-ray (HXR) flux (using RHESSI data). The synthesized Hα line profiles were compared with the observed spectra. During the impulsive phase of the flare, the evolution of the observed and synthetic Hα line intensity agrees, but discrepancies were found in intensities at specific wavelengths of the Hα line profile. Fluctuations in the energy flux of NTEs exhibited a strong correlation with the Hα emission during the HXR pulse. After considering various effects (such as the filling factor FF = 0.20) that could influence observed emissions, relatively good agreement between theoretical and observed lines was achieved.

<title>JWST Validates HST Distance Measurements: Selection of Supernova Subsample Explains Differences in JWST Estimates of Local H 0</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We cross-check the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Cepheid/Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) distance ladder, which yields the most precise local H0, against early James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) subsamples (∼1/4 of the HST sample) from SH0ES and CCHP, calibrated only with NGC 4258. We find HST Cepheid distances agree well (∼1σ) with all combinations of methods, samples, and telescopes. The comparisons explicitly include the measurement uncertainty of each method in NGC 4258, an oft-neglected but dominant term. Mean differences are ∼0.03 mag, far smaller than the 0.18 mag “Hubble tension.” Combining all measures produces the strongest constraint yet on the linearity of HST Cepheid distances, 0.994 ±0.010, ruling out distance-dependent bias or offset as the source of the tension at ∼7σ. However, current JWST subsamples produce large sampling differences in H0 whose size and direction we can directly estimate from the full HST set. We show that ΔH0 ∼ 2.5 km s−1 Mpc−1 between the CCHP JWST program and the full HST sample is entirely consistent with differences in sample selection. We combine all JWST samples into a new distance-limited set of 16 SNe Ia at D ≤ 25 Mpc. Using JWST Cepheids, JAGB, and tip of the red giant branch, we find 73.4 ± 2.1, 72.2 ± 2.2, and 72.1 ± 2.2 km s−1 Mpc−1, respectively. Explicitly accounting for common supernovae, the three-method JWST result is H0 = 72.6 ± 2.0, similar to H0 = 72.8 expected from HST Cepheids in the same galaxies. The small JWST sample trivially lowers the Hubble tension significance due to small-sample statistics and is not yet competitive with the HST set (42 SNe Ia and 4 anchors), which yields 73.2 ± 0.9. Still, the joint JWST sample provides important cross-checks that the HST data pass.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The afterglow of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been extensively discussed in the context of shocks generated during an interaction of relativistic outflows with their ambient medium. This process leads to the formation of both a forward and a reverse shock. While the emission from the forward shock, observed off-axis, has been well-studied as a potential electromagnetic counterpart to a gravitational-wave-detected merger, the contribution of the reverse shock is commonly overlooked. In this paper, we investigate the contribution of the reverse shock to the GRB afterglows observed off-axis. In our analysis, we consider jets with different angular profiles, including two-component jets, power-law structured jets, Gaussian jets, and “mixed jets” featuring a Poynting-flux-dominated core surrounded by a baryonic wing. We apply our model to GRB 170817A/GW170817 and employ the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to obtain model parameters. Our findings suggest that the reverse shock emission can significantly contribute to the early afterglow. In addition, our calculations indicate that the light curves observable in future off-axis GRBs may exhibit either double peaks or a single peak with a prominent feature, depending on the jet structure, viewing angle, and microphysics shock parameters.

<title>X-Ray Spectroscopy of the Dwarf Nova Z Chamaeleontis in Quiescence and Outburst Using the XMM-Newton Observatory</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad85e5</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present X-ray spectroscopy of the SU UMa–type dwarf nova Z Chamaeleontis using the European Photon Imaging Camera and reflection grating spectrometer (RGS) instruments on board the XMM-Newton observatory. The quiescent system can be modeled by collisional equilibrium (CIE) or nonequilibrium plasma models, yielding a kT of 8.2–13.0 keV at a luminosity of (5.0–6.0) × 1030 erg s−1. The spectra yield better using partially covering absorbers of cold and/or photoionized nature. The ionized absorber has an equivalent NH = (3.4–5.9) × 1022 cm−2 and a log(ξ) = 3.5–3.7 with a (50–60)% covering fraction when the VNEI model (XSPEC) is used. The line diagnosis in quiescence shows no resonance lines, with only the forbidden lines of Ne, Mg, and Si detected. The H-like C, O, Ne, and Mg are detected. The strongest line is O viii, with (2.7–4.6) × 10−14 erg s−1 cm−2. The quiescent X-ray-emitting plasma is not collisional and not in ionization equilibrium, which is consistent with hot ADAF-like accretion flows. The line diagnosis in the outburst shows He-like O and Ne, with intercombination lines being the strongest, along with weaker resonance lines. This indicates the plasma is more collisional and denser, but not yet in CIE, revealing ionization timescales of (0.97–1.4) × 1011 s cm−3. The R ratios in the outburst yield electron densities of (7–90) × 1011 cm−3 and the G ratios yield electron temperatures of (2–3) × 106 K. The outburst luminosity is (1.4–2.5) × 1030 erg s−1. The flow is inhomogeneous in density. All detected lines are narrow, with widths limited by the resolution of RGS, yielding Keplerian rotational velocities <1000 km s−1. This is too low for boundary layers, consistent with the nature of ADAF-like hot flows.

<title>Filament Accretion and Fragmentation in the Perseus Molecular Cloud</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Observations suggest that filaments in molecular clouds can grow by mass accretion while forming cores via fragmentation. Here, we present one of the first large-sample studies of filament accretion using velocity gradient measurements of star-forming filaments on the ∼0.05 pc scale with NH3 observations of the Perseus Molecular Cloud, primarily obtained as a part of the Green Bank Ammonia Survey. In this study, we find significant correlations between the velocity gradient, velocity dispersion, mass per unit length, and number of cores per unit length of the Perseus filaments. Our results suggest a scenario in which filaments not only grow through mass accretion, but also form new cores continuously in the process, well into the thermally supercritical regime. Such behavior is contrary to that expected from isolated filament models but consistent with how filaments form within a more realistic cloud environment, suggesting that the cloud environment plays a crucial role in shaping core formation and evolution in filaments. Furthermore, even though velocity gradients within filaments are not oriented randomly, we find no correlation between velocity gradient orientation and the filament properties we analyzed. This result suggests that gravity is unlikely to be the dominant mechanism imposing order on the ∼0.05 pc scale for dense star-forming gas.

<title>The Star-forming Main Sequence in JADES and CEERS at z > 1.4: Investigating the Burstiness of Star Formation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have used public JWST/NIRSpec and JWST/NIRCam observations from the CEERS and JADES surveys in order to analyze the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) over the redshift range 1.4 ≤ z < 7. We calculate the star formation rates (SFRs) of the galaxy sample using three approaches: Balmer line luminosity, spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, and UV luminosity. We find a larger degree of scatter about the SFMS using the Balmer-based SFRs compared to the UV-based SFRs. Because these SFR indicators are sensitive to star formation on different timescales, the difference in scatter may be evidence of bursty star formation histories in the early Universe. We additionally compare the Hα-to-UV luminosity ratio (L(Hα)/νLν,1600) for individual galaxies in the sample and find that 29%–52% of the ratios across the sample are poorly described by predictions from a smooth star formation history. Measuring the burstiness of star formation in the early Universe has multiple significant implications, such as deriving accurate physical parameters from SED fitting, explaining the evolution of the UV luminosity function, and providing constraints for subgrid models of feedback in simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.

<title>Galaxy Spectroscopy without Spectra: Galaxy Properties from Photometric Images with Conditional Diffusion Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Modern spectroscopic surveys can only target a small fraction of the vast amount of photometrically cataloged sources in wide-field surveys. Here, we report the development of a generative artificial intelligence (AI) method capable of predicting optical galaxy spectra from photometric broadband images alone. This method draws from the latest advances in diffusion models in combination with contrastive networks. We pass multiband galaxy images into the architecture to obtain optical spectra. From these, robust values for galaxy properties can be derived with any methods in the spectroscopic toolbox, such as standard population synthesis techniques and Lick indices. When trained and tested on 64 × 64 pixel images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the global bimodality of star-forming and quiescent galaxies in photometric space is recovered, as well as a mass–metallicity relation of star-forming galaxies. The comparison between the observed and the artificially created spectra shows good agreement in overall metallicity, age, Dn4000, stellar velocity dispersion, and E(B − V) values. Photometric redshift estimates of our generative algorithm can compete with other current, specialized deep learning techniques. Moreover, this work is the first attempt in the literature to infer velocity dispersion from photometric images. Additionally, we can predict the presence of an active galactic nucleus up to an accuracy of 82%. With our method, scientifically interesting galaxy properties, normally requiring spectroscopic inputs, can be obtained in future data sets from large-scale photometric surveys alone. The spectra prediction via AI can further assist in creating realistic mock catalogs.

Infrared (IR) spectral features of interstellar and solar system ices have been attributed to solid organic and inorganic compounds for over 50 yr, but in many cases the laboratory IR data needed to fully quantify such work have never been published, forcing researchers to rely on assumptions about gas- or liquid-phase measurements to interpret data for ices. Here, we report the first mid-IR intensity measurements for isocyanic acid (HNCO) ices that are free of such assumptions, providing new results for use by both observational and laboratory astrochemists. We also report similar new IR data for both formaldehyde (H2CO) and formic acid (HCOOH), which have been discussed in the astrochemical literature for decades, but again without adequate laboratory data to help quantify observational results. Densities and refractive indices of HNCO, H2CO, and HCOOH as amorphous ices also are reported. Two applications of the new H2CO work are presented, the first vapor-pressure measurements of solid H2CO, along with an enthalpy of sublimation, at 100 to 109 K and a set of IR intensities of H2CO in H2O + H2CO ices. Band strengths, absorption coefficients, and optical constants are calculated for all three compounds. Extensive comparisons are made to older results, which are not recommended for future use.

<title>A Thorough Search for Short-timescale Periodicity in Four Active Repeating Fast Radio Bursts</title>

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright radio transients with millisecond durations, which typically occur at extragalactic distances. The association of FRB 20200428 with the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 strongly indicates that they could originate from neutron stars, which naturally leads to the expectation that periodicity connected with the spinning of magnetars should exist in the activities of repeating FRBs. However, previous studies have failed to find any signatures supporting such a conjecture. Here we perform a thorough search for short-timescale periodicity in the four most active repeating sources, i.e., FRBs 20121102A, 20200120E, 20201124A, and 20220912A. Three different methods are employed, including a phase folding algorithm, the H-test, and Lomb–Scargle periodograms. For the three most active repeaters from which more than 1000 bursts have been detected, i.e., FRBs 20121102A, 20201124A, and 20220912A, more in-depth period searches are conducted by considering various burst properties such as the pulse width, peak flux, fluence, and the brightness temperature. No clear periodicity is found in a period range of 0.001–1000 s in all efforts. Implications of such a null result on the theoretical models of FRBs are discussed.

<title>Intergalactic Medium Rotation Measure of Primordial Magnetic Fields</title>

The Faraday rotation effect, quantified by the rotation measure (RM), is a powerful probe of the large-scale magnetization of the Universe—tracing magnetic fields not only on galaxy and galaxy cluster scales but also in the intergalactic medium (IGM; referred to as RMIGM). The redshift dependence of the latter has extensively been explored with observations. It has also been shown that this relation can help to distinguish between different large-scale magnetization scenarios. We study the evolution of this RMIGM for different primordial magnetogenesis scenarios to search for the imprints of primordial magnetic fields (PMFs; magnetic fields originating in the early Universe) on the redshift-dependence of RMIGM. We use cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulations for evolving PMFs during large-scale structure formation, coupled with the light-cone analysis to produce a realistic statistical sample of mock RMIGM images. We study the predicted behavior for the cosmic evolution of RMIGM for different correlation lengths of PMFs, and provide fitting functions for their dependence on redshifts. We compare these mock RM trends with the recent analysis of the the LOw-Frequency ARray RM Grid and find that large-scale-correlated PMFs should have (comoving) strengths ≲0.75 nG, if they originated during inflation with the scale-invariant spectrum and (comoving) correlation length of ∼19 h−1 cMpc or ≲30 nG if they originated during phase-transition epochs with the comoving correlation length of ∼1 h−1 cMpc. Our findings agree with previous observations and confirm the results of semi-analytical studies, showing that upper limits on the PMF strength decrease as their coherence scales increase.

<title>Dynamic 3D Simulation of Surface Charging on Rotating Asteroids</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The surface-charging phenomenon of asteroids, mainly resulting from solar wind plasma and solar radiation, has been extensively studied. However, the influence of the asteroid’s rotation on surface charging is not yet fully understood. In this study, a neural network is established to replace numerical integration, improving the efficiency of dynamic 3D simulations. We simulate rotating asteroids and their surrounding plasma environments under various conditions, including the quiet solar wind and solar storms. Different minerals on the asteroid surface are also considered. Additionally, the effects of orbital motion and obliquity are studied for asteroids with rotation periods comparable to their orbital periods. The results show that under the typical solar wind, the maximum and minimum potentials of asteroids gradually decrease with increasing rotation periods, especially when the solar wind is obliquely incident. For asteroids with rotation periods longer than one week, this decreasing trend becomes extremely slow. During a solar storm, the solar wind plasma changes sharply, and the susceptibility of an asteroid’s surface potential to rotation is greatly pronounced. Surface minerals also play a role; plagioclase is the most sensitive mineral among those explored, while ilmenite appears indifferent to changes in rotation periods. Understanding the surface charging of asteroids under various rotation periods and angles is crucial for further research on solar wind plasma and asteroids’ surface dust motion, providing a reference for the safe landing and exploration of asteroids.

<title>Multiple Components of the Outflow in the Protostellar System HH 212: Outer Outflow Shell, Rotating Wind, Shocked Wind, and Jet</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8eb4</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8eb4</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 7 observations of the CO (J = 3−2) line emission of the protostellar system HH 212 at ∼24 au spatial resolution and compare them to those of the SiO (J = 8−7) and SO (J = 8−7) line emission reported in the literature. We find that the CO line traces four distinct regions: (1) an outer outflow shell, (2) a rotating wind region between the SiO and CO shells, (3) the shocked and wide-angle inner X-wind inside a SiO shell, and (4) the jet. The origin of the CO outer outflow shell could be associated with the entrained material of the envelope, or an extended disk wind. The rotating wind, which is shocked, is launched from a radius of 9–15 au, slightly exterior to that of the previously detected SO shell, which marks the boundary where the wide-angle X-wind is interacting with and shocking the disk wind. Additionally, the SO is found to be mixed with the CO emission within the thick and extended rotating wind region. The large-scale CO-shocked wind coexists with the SO emission near the upper portion of the inner shocked region converged on top of the inner SiO knots. The CO jet is traced by a chain of knots with roughly equal intervals, exhibiting quasiperiodicity, as reported in other jets in the literature.

<title>Mergers, Radio Jets, and Quenching Star Formation in Massive Galaxies: Quantifying Their Synchronized Cosmic Evolution and Assessing the Energetics</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8f3e</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The existence of a population of massive quiescent galaxies with little to no star formation poses a challenge to our understanding of galaxy evolution. The physical process that quenched the star formation in these galaxies is debated, but the most popular possibility is that feedback from supermassive black holes lifts or heats the gas that would otherwise be used to form stars. In this paper, we evaluate this idea in two ways. First, we compare the cumulative growth in the cosmic inventory of the total stellar mass in quiescent galaxies to the corresponding growth in the amount of kinetic energy carried by radio jets. We find that these two inventories are remarkably well-synchronized, with about 50% of the total amounts being created in the epoch from z ≈ 1 to 2. We also show that these agree extremely well with the corresponding growth in the cumulative number of major mergers that result in massive (>1011Mʘ) galaxies. We therefore argue that major mergers trigger the radio jets and also transform the galaxies from disks to spheroids. Second, we evaluate the total amount of kinetic energy delivered by jets and compare it to the baryonic binding energy of the galaxies. We find the jet kinetic energy is more than sufficient to quench star formation, and the quenching process should be more effective in more massive galaxies. We show that these results are quantitatively consistent with recent measurements of the Sunyaev–Zel’dovich effect seen in massive galaxies at z ≈ 1.

<title>Detailed Calculations of the Efficiency of Planetesimal Accretion in the Core-accretion Model. III. The Contribution of Planetesimals beyond Saturn</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Continuing our initiative on advancing the calculations of planetesimal accretion in the core-accretion model, we present here the results of our recent study of the contributions of planetesimals around and beyond the orbit of Saturn. In our first two papers, where our focus was on the effects of the Sun and Saturn, the initial distribution of planetesimals was limited to the regions around the accretion zone of a growing Jupiter. In this paper, we expanded that distribution to regions beyond the accretion zone of Saturn. We integrated the orbits of a large ensemble of planetesimals and studied the rate of their capture by the growing proto-Jupiter. In order to be consistent with our previous studies, we did not consider the effect of the nebular gas. Results demonstrated that the exterior planetesimals, especially those beyond 8 au, have only slight contributions to the growth and metallicity of the growing Jupiter. The final mass and composition of this planet is mainly due to the planetesimals inside and around its accretion zone. Our study shows that although the rate of capture varies slightly by the size and composition of planetesimals, in general, the final results are independent of the size and material of these bodies. Results also pointed to a new finding: the rate of accretion follows the same trend as that of the evolution of Jupiter’s envelope, with the largest accretion occurring during the envelope’s collapse. We present details of our analysis and discuss the implications of its results.

<title>Challenges for Fast Radio Bursts as Multimessenger Sources from Binary Neutron Star Mergers</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9023</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration transients from extragalactic sources, with their origins remaining a topic of active debate. Among the proposed progenitors, binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are compelling candidates for some nonrepeating FRBs. However, associating FRBs with BNS mergers cannot be based solely on low chance coincidence probability. This study delineates necessary criteria for associating FRBs with BNS mergers, focusing on the postmerger ejecta environment. To underscore the significance of these criteria, we scrutinise the proposed association between GW190425 and FRB 20190425A, considering the requirement for the FRB signal to traverse the dense merger ejecta without significant attenuation to remain detectable at 400 MHz. Our investigation reveals that if the FRB is linked to the gravitational-wave (GW) event, the GW data support a highly off-axis configuration, with a probability of the BNS merger viewing angle p(θv > 30°) being ≈99.99%. This strongly excludes an on-axis system, which is required for this FRB to be detectable. We also find faraway FRB emission models inadequate to explain the FRB 20190425A–GW190425 connection. Thus, we conclude that GW190425 is not related to FRB 20190425A. We discuss the implications for future multimessenger observations, suggesting that BNS merger remnants are unlikely to account for more than 1% of FRB sources. This finding implies that short gamma-ray bursts, which are expected to occur in only a fraction of all BNS mergers, cannot account for the overall characteristics of the FRB host population.

<title>Exploring Magnetic Fields in a Merging Galaxy: Comparing Polarization and Velocity Gradient in the Centaurus Galaxy</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad93a3</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this study, we apply the velocity gradient technique to the merging Centaurus galaxy. We compare gradient maps derived from the PHANGS-Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array survey using CO emission lines with magnetic field tracings from dust polarization data obtained via the HAWC+ instrument. Our analysis reveals a strong correspondence between the directions indicated by these two tracers across most of the galactic image. Specifically, we identify jet regions as areas of antialignment, consistent with previous reports that gradients tend to rotate 90° in outflow regions. Statistically, we find that the alignment of magnetic fields, as revealed by polarization, is most accurate in regions with the highest signal-to-noise ratios. Our findings underscore the utility of velocity gradients as a valuable complementary tool for probing magnetic fields and dynamical processes in merging galaxies. This proves the general utility of velocity gradients for mapping magnetic fields in astrophysical objects with complex dynamics.

<title>Dark Matter Halos of Luminous Active Galactic Nuclei from Galaxy–Galaxy Lensing with the HSC Subaru Strategic Program</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad86b5</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We assess the dark matter halo masses of luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs) over the redshift range 0.2–1.2 using galaxy–galaxy lensing based on imaging data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). We measure the weak lensing signal of a sample of 48,907 AGNs constructed using HSC and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer photometry. As expected, we find that the lensing mass profile of total AGN sample is consistent with that of massive galaxies ( 10.61). Surprisingly, the lensing signal remains unchanged when the AGN sample is split into four host galaxy stellar mass bins. Specifically, we find that the excess surface density of AGNs residing in galaxies with high stellar masses significantly differs from that of the control sample. We further fit a halo occupation distribution model to the data to infer the posterior distribution of parameters including the average halo mass. We find that the characteristic halo mass of the full AGN population lies near the knee ( ) of the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR). Illustrative of the results given above, the halo masses of AGNs residing in host galaxies with high stellar masses (i.e., above the knee of the SHMR) fall below the calibrated SHMR while the halo masses of the low stellar mass sample are more consistent with the established SHMR. These results indicate that massive halos with a higher clustering bias tend to suppress AGN activity, probably due to the lack of available gas.

<title>ODIN: Identifying Protoclusters and Cosmic Filaments Traced by Lyα-emitting Galaxies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To understand the formation and evolution of massive cosmic structures, studying them at high redshift, in the epoch when they formed the majority of their mass, is essential. The One-hundred-deg2 DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey is undertaking the widest-area narrowband program to date, to use Lyα-emitting galaxies (LAEs) to trace the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe on the scale of 10–100 cMpc at three cosmic epochs. In this work, we present results at z = 3.1 based on early ODIN data in the COSMOS field. We identify protoclusters and cosmic filaments using multiple methods and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. We then compare our observations against the IllustrisTNG suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The two are in excellent agreement, identifying a similar number and angular size of structures above a specified density threshold. We successfully recover the simulated protoclusters with log(Mz=0/M⊙) ≳ 14.4 in ∼60% of the cases. With these objects, we show that the descendant masses of our observed protoclusters can be estimated purely based on our 2D measurements, finding a median z = 0 mass of ∼1014.5M⊙. The lack of information on the radial extent of each protocluster introduces a ∼0.4 dex uncertainty in its descendant mass. Finally, we show that the recovery of the cosmic web in the vicinity of protoclusters is both efficient and accurate. The similarity of our observations and the simulations implies that our structure selection is likewise robust and efficient, demonstrating that LAEs are reliable tracers of the LSS.

<title>Constraining the Circumstellar Medium Structure and Progenitor Mass-loss History of Interacting Supernovae Through 3D Hydrodynamic Modeling: The Case of SN 2014C</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8ac8</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8ac8</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate SN 2014C using three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic modeling, focusing on its early interaction with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). Our objective is to uncover the pre-supernova (SN) CSM structure and constrain the progenitor star’s mass-loss history prior to core collapse. Our comprehensive model traces the evolution from the progenitor star through the SN event and into the SN remnant phase. We simulate the remnant’s expansion over approximately 15 yr, incorporating a CSM derived from the progenitor star’s outflows through dedicated hydrodynamic simulations. Analysis reveals that the remnant interacted with a dense toroidal nebula extending from 4.3 × 1016 to 1.5 × 1017 cm in the equatorial plane, with a thickness of approximately 1.2 × 1017 cm. The nebula’s density peaks at approximately 3 × 106 cm−3 at the inner boundary, gradually decreasing as ≈r−2 at greater distances. This nebula formed due to intense mass loss from the progenitor star between approximately 5000 and 1000 yr before collapse. During this period, the maximum mass-loss rate reached about 8 × 10−4M⊙ yr−1, ejecting ≈2.5 M⊙ of stellar material into the CSM. Our model accurately reproduces Chandra and NuSTAR spectra, including the iron (Fe) K line, throughout the remnant’s evolution. Notably, the Fe line is self-consistently reproduced, originating from shocked ejecta, with ≈0.05 M⊙ of pure-Fe ejecta shocked during the remnant–nebula interaction. These findings suggest that the 3D geometry and density distribution of the CSM, as well as the progenitor star’s mass-loss history, align with a scenario where the star was stripped through binary interaction, specifically common-envelope evolution.

<title>Exploring Lenticular Galaxy Formation in Field Environments Using NewHorizon: Evidence for Counterrotating Gas Accretion as a Formation Channel</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The formation pathways of lenticular galaxies (S0s) in field environments remain a matter of debate. We utilize the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, NewHorizon, to investigate the issue. We select two massive star formation quenched S0s as our main sample. By closely tracing their physical and morphological evolution, we identify two primary formation channels: mergers and counterrotating gas accretion. The former induces central gas inflow due to gravitational and hydrodynamic torques, triggering active central star formation, which quickly depletes the gas of the galaxy. Counterrotating gas accretion overall has a similar outcome but more exclusively through hydrodynamic collisions between the preexisting and newly accreted gas. Both channels lead to S0 morphology, with gas angular momentum cancellation being a crucial mechanism. These formation pathways quench star formation on a short timescale (<Gyr) compared to the timescales of environmental effects. We also discuss how counterrotating gas accretion may explain the origin of S0s with ongoing star formation and the frequently observed gas–star misaligned kinematics in S0s.

<title>Halfway to the Peak: The JWST MIRI 5.6 μm Number Counts and Source Population</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8c22</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8c22</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present an analysis of eight JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) 5.6 μm images with 5σ depths of ≈0.1 μJy. We detect 2854 sources within our combined area of 18.4 arcmin2. We compute the MIRI 5.6 μm number counts, including an analysis of the field-to-field variation. Compared to earlier published MIRI 5.6 μm counts, our counts have a more pronounced knee, at roughly 2 μJy. The location and amplitude of the counts at the knee are consistent with the Cowley et al. model predictions, although these models tend to overpredict the counts below the knee. In areas of overlap, 84% of the MIRI sources have a counterpart in the COSMOS2020 catalog. These MIRI sources have redshifts that are mostly in the z ∼ 0.5–2, with a tail out to z ∼ 5. They are predominantly moderate to low stellar masses (108–1010M⊙) main-sequence star-forming galaxies, suggesting that with ≈2 hr exposures, MIRI can reach well below M* at cosmic noon and reach higher mass systems out to z ∼ 5. Nearly 70% of the COSMOS2020 sources in areas of overlap now have a data point at 5.6 μm (rest-frame near-IR at cosmic noon), which allows for more accurate stellar population parameter estimates. Finally, we discovered 31 MIRI-bright sources not present in COSMOS2020. A crossmatch with IRAC channel 1 suggests that 10%–20% of these are likely lower mass (M* ≈ 109M⊙), z ∼ 1 dusty galaxies. The rest (80%–90%) are consistent with more massive but still very dusty galaxies at z > 3.

<title>Exploring Pulsar Timing Precision: A Comparative Study of Polarization Calibration Methods for NANOGrav Data from the Green Bank Telescope</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Pulsar timing array experiments have recently uncovered evidence for a nanohertz gravitational wave background by precisely timing an ensemble of millisecond pulsars. The next significant milestones for these experiments include characterizing the detected background with greater precision, identifying its source(s), and detecting continuous gravitational waves from individual supermassive black hole binaries. To achieve these objectives, generating accurate and precise times of arrival of pulses from pulsar observations is crucial. Incorrect polarization calibration of the observed pulsar profiles may introduce errors in the measured times of arrival. Further, previous studies have demonstrated that robust polarization calibration of pulsar profiles can reduce noise in the pulsar timing data and improve timing solutions. In this paper, we investigate and compare the impact of different polarization calibration methods on pulsar timing precision using three distinct calibration techniques: the Ideal Feed Assumption (IFA), Measurement Equation Modeling (MEM), and Measurement Equation Template Matching (METM). Three NANOGrav pulsars—PSRs J1643−1224, J1744−1134, and J1909−3744—observed with the 800 MHz and 1.5 GHz receivers at the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) are utilized for our analysis. Our findings reveal that all three calibration methods enhance timing precision compared to scenarios where no polarization calibration is performed. Additionally, among the three calibration methods, the IFA approach generally provides the best results for timing analysis of pulsars observed with the GBT receiver system. We attribute the comparatively poorer performance of the MEM and METM methods to potential instabilities in the reference noise diode coupled to the receiver and temporal variations in the profile of the reference pulsar, respectively.

<title>A Rapidly Accreting Active Galactic Nucleus Hidden in a Dust-obscured Galaxy at z ∼ 0.8</title>

Dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) containing central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that are rapidly accreting (i.e., having high Eddington ratios, λEdd) may represent a key phase closest to the peak of both the black hole and galaxy growth in the coevolution framework for SMBHs and galaxies. In this work, we present a 68 ks XMM-Newton observation of the high-λEdd DOG J1324+4501 at z ∼ 0.8, which was initially observed by Chandra. We analyze the XMM-Newton spectra jointly with archival Chandra spectra. In performing a detailed X-ray spectral analysis, we find that the source is intrinsically X-ray luminous with /erg and heavily obscured with . We further utilize UV-to-IR archival photometry to measure and fit the source’s spectral energy distribution to estimate its host-galaxy properties. We present a supplementary comparison sample of 21 X-ray luminous DOGs from the XMM-SERVS survey with sufficient (>200) 0.5–10 keV counts to perform a similarly detailed X-ray spectral analysis. Of the X-ray luminous DOGs in our sample, we find that J1324+4501 is the most remarkable, possessing one of the highest X-ray luminosities, column densities, and star formation rates. We demonstrate that J1324+4501 is in an extreme evolutionary stage where SMBH accretion and galaxy growth are at their peaks.

<title>A Census of Dwarf Galaxy Satellites around LMC-mass Galaxy NGC 2403*</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8dcd</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the first comprehensive census of the satellite population around a Large Magellanic Cloud stellar-mass galaxy, as part of the Magellanic Analog Dwarf Companions and Stellar Halos (MADCASH) survey. We have surveyed NGC 2403 (D = 3.0 Mpc) with the Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam imager out to a projected radius of 90 kpc (with partial coverage extending out to ∼110 kpc, or ∼80% of the virial radius of NGC 2403), resolving stars in the uppermost ∼2.5 mag of its red giant branch. By looking for stellar overdensities in the red giant branch spatial density map, we identify 149 satellite candidates, of which only the previously discovered MADCASH J074238+65201-dw is a bona fide dwarf, together with the more massive and disrupting satellite DDO 44. We carefully assess the completeness of our search via injection of artificial dwarf galaxies into the images, finding that we are reliably sensitive to candidates down to MV ∼ −7.5 mag (and somewhat sensitive to even fainter satellites). A comparison of the satellite luminosity function of NGC 2403 down to this magnitude limit to theoretical expectations shows overall good agreement. This is the first of a full sample of 11 Magellanic Cloud–mass host galaxies we will analyze, creating a statistical sample that will provide the first quantitative constraints on hierarchical models of galaxy formation around low-mass hosts.

<title>Insights into the Long-term Flaring Events of Blazar PKS 0805-07: A Multiwavelength Analysis Over the Period of 2009–2023</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8ddb</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8ddb</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We conducted a comprehensive temporal and spectral study of the FSRQ PKS 0805-07 by using broadband observations from the Fermi-LAT and Swift-XRT/UVOT instruments over the period of MJD 54684-60264. The 3 day binned γ-ray light curve during the active state revealed 11 distinct peak structures with the maximum integral flux (E > 100 MeV) reached (1.56 ± 0.16) × 10−6 photons cm−2 s−1 on MJD 59904.5. The shortest observed γ-ray variability was 2.80 ± 0.77 days. A correlation analysis between the γ-ray spectral index and flux indicated the typical trend of hardening when the source is brighter, commonly observed in blazars. We identified a lag of 121 (+27.21, −3.51) days in the spectral index relative to the flux, within the time interval MJD 59582 to 60112. The Anderson–Darling test and histogram fit rejected the normality of the γ-ray flux distribution and instead suggested a log-normal distribution. To gain insight into the underlying physical processes, we extracted broadband spectra from different time periods in the light curve. The spectral energy distribution during various flux states was well-reproduced using synchrotron, synchrotron-self-Compton, and external-Compton emissions from a broken power-law electron distribution. The seed photons required for the external Compton process are from the IR region. A comparison of the best-fit physical parameters indicated that the variations in different flux states were primarily associated with an increase in the bulk Lorentz factor and magnetic field from low to high flux states.

<title>Differential Rotation of Individual Sunspots and Pores</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90a0</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The analysis of the rotation rate of individual sunspots and pores was performed according to the data from the processing of observations by the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager in the period 2010–2024. Sunspots stood out in the images in the continuum. To accurately track the spots, we processed five images for each day. To determine the polarity of the magnetic field, we superimposed the contours of sunspots on observations of magnetic fields at the same time. This made it possible to track the movement of more than 210,000 individual sunspots and pores. It is found that the rotation rate is influenced by the rotation rate of the solar atmosphere and the systematic proper motions of the spots. Sunspots and pores of the leading polarity have a rate of meridional movement ≈2.4% faster than spots of the trailing polarity. We also found that regular sunspots, which have umbrae and penumbrae, rotate ≈1.5% faster than solar pores, in which penumbrae are absent. The dependence of the rotation rate on the area is found. For sunspots with an area of S > 10 μhm, the rotation rate is practically independent of the area. Small sunspots, with an area of S < 10 μhm, rotate ≈1.7% more slowly.

<title>Observations of the Crustal Mini-magnetopause Reconnection at Mars</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Magnetopause reconnection is a fundamental mechanism for mass and energy transfer in terrestrial planetary systems. Unlike Earth, Mars lacks a global magnetic field and instead has localized crustal magnetic fields, which can create structures morphologically similar to a scaled-down intrinsic magnetosphere, potentially forming mini-magnetospheres. In this study, we investigate reconnection in Martian mini-magnetospheres on the dayside, analyzing key characteristics of the reconnecting current sheet, and the associated ion escape rate, and comparing these features to reconnection events at the induced magnetopause documented in previous studies. Our observations reveal that, in the subsolar region, the thickness of the Martian mini-magnetopause is comparable to the upstream proton inertial length and the convective gyroradius of the magnetosheath solar wind. However, at higher solar zenith angles, this thickness increases to several times these characteristic lengths. Reconnection-driven ion escape rates at the induced magnetopause are at least 1 order of magnitude greater than those associated with mini-magnetopause reconnection. These findings provide new insights into reconnection processes at Martian boundary layers.

<title>Implementation of Aerosol Mie Scattering in POSEIDON with Application to the Hot Jupiter HD 189733 b’s Transmission, Emission, and Reflected Light Spectrum</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Aerosols are a ubiquitous feature of planetary atmospheres and leave clear spectral imprints in exoplanet spectra. Pre-JWST, exoplanet retrieval frameworks mostly adopted simple parametric approximations. With JWST, we now have access to mid-infrared wavelengths where aerosols have detectable composition-specific resonance features. Here, we implement new features into the open-source atmospheric retrieval code POSEIDON to account for the complex scattering, reflection, and absorption properties of Mie-scattering aerosols. We provide an open-source database of these Mie-scattering cross sections and optical properties. We also extend the radiative transfer and retrieval functionality in POSEIDON to include multiple scattering reflection and emission spectroscopy. We demonstrate these new retrieval capabilities on archival Hubble and Spitzer transmission and secondary-eclipse spectra of the hot Jupiter HD 189733 b. We find that a high-altitude, low-density, and thin slab composed of submicron particles is necessary to fit HD 189733 b’s transmission spectrum, with multiple aerosol species providing a good fit. We additionally retrieve a subsolar H2O abundance, a subsolar K abundance, and do not detect CO2. Our joint thermal and reflection retrievals of HD 189733 b’s secondary-eclipse spectrum, however, finds no evidence of dayside aerosols, a subsolar dayside H2O abundance, enhanced CO2, or slightly subsolar alkali abundances. We additionally explore how retrieval model choices such as cloud parameterization, aerosol species and properties, and thermal structure parameterization affect retrieved atmospheric properties. Upcoming JWST data for hot Jupiters such as HD 189733 b will be well suited to enable deeper exploration of aerosol properties, allowing the formulation of a self-consistent, multidimensional picture of cloud formation processes.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We use mid-infrared variability in galaxies to search for active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the local universe. We use a sample of 10,220 galaxies from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory survey, part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. For each galaxy, we examine its mid-infrared variability in the W2 [4.6 μm] band over 13 years using data from the Wide Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) All-Sky and Near Earth Objects WISE missions. We demonstrate that we can detect variability signatures as small as about 7% in the rms variation of W2 flux for the majority of cases. Using other AGN signatures of the variable galaxies, such as optical narrow lines, optical broad lines, and WISE W1 − W2 colors, we show that ∼75% of the variables show these additional AGN signatures, indicating that the bulk of these cases are likely to be AGN. We also identify seven galaxies that have light curves characteristic of tidal disruption events. We present here a publicly available catalog of the light-curve variability in W2 of these galaxies.

<title>Confirming the Tidal Tails of the Young Open Cluster Blanco 1 with TESS Rotation Periods</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Blanco 1 is an ≈130 Myr open cluster located 240 pc from the Sun, below the Galactic plane. Recent studies have reported the existence of diffuse tidal tails extending 50–60 pc from the cluster center based on the positions and velocities measured by Gaia. To independently assess the reality and extent of this structure, we used light curves generated from TESS full-frame images to search for photometric rotation periods of stars in and around Blanco 1. We detected rotation periods down to a stellar effective temperature of ≈3100 K in 347 of the 603 cluster member candidates for which we have light curves. For cluster members in the core and candidate members in the tidal tails, both within a temperature range of 4400–6200 K, 74% and 72% of the rotation periods, respectively, are consistent with the single-star gyrochronological sequence. In contrast, a comparison sample of field stars yielded gyrochrone-consistent rotation periods for only 8.5% of the stars. The tidal tail candidates’ overall conformance to the core members’ gyrochrone sequence implies that their contamination ratio is consistent with zero and <0.33 at the 2σ level. This result confirms the existence of Blanco 1 tidal tails and doubles the number of Blanco 1 members for which there are both spatio-kinematic and rotation-based cluster membership verification. Extending the strategy of using TESS light curves for gyrochronology to other nearby young open clusters and stellar associations may provide a viable strategy for mapping out their dissolution and broadening the search for young exoplanets.

<title>Universal Nonthermal Power-law Distribution Functions from the Self-consistent Evolution of Collisionless Electrostatic Plasmas</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad91a1</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad91a1</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Collisionless systems often exhibit nonthermal power-law tails in their distribution functions. Interestingly, collisionless plasmas in various physical scenarios (e.g., the ion population of the solar wind) feature a v−5 tail in their velocity (v) distribution, whose origin has been a long-standing puzzle. We show this power-law tail to be a natural outcome of the collisionless relaxation of driven electrostatic plasmas. Using a quasi-linear analysis of the perturbed Vlasov–Poisson equations, we show that the coarse-grained mean distribution function (DF), f0, follows a quasi-linear diffusion equation with a diffusion coefficient D(v) that depends on v through the plasma dielectric constant. If the plasma is isotropically forced on scales larger than the Debye length with a white-noise-like electric field, D(v) ∼ v4 for σ < v < ωP/k, with σ the thermal velocity, ωP the plasma frequency, and k the characteristic wavenumber of the perturbation; the corresponding quasi-steady-state f0 develops a v−(d + 2) tail in d dimensions (v−5 tail in 3D), while the energy (E) distribution develops an E−2 tail independent of dimensionality. Any redness of the noise only alters the scaling in the high v end. Nonresonant particles moving slower than the phase velocity of the plasma waves (ωP/k) experience a Debye-screened electric field, and significantly less (power-law suppressed) acceleration than the near-resonant particles. Thus, a Maxwellian DF develops a power-law tail, while its core (v < σ) eventually also heats up but over a much longer timescale. We definitively show that self-consistency (ignored in test-particle treatments) is crucial for the emergence of the universal v−5 tail.

<title>Kink Instability of Flux Ropes in Partially Ionized Plasmas</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In the solar atmosphere, flux ropes are subject to current-driven instabilities that are crucial in driving plasma eruptions, ejections, and heating. A typical ideal magnetohydrodynamics instability developing in flux ropes is the helical kink, which twists the flux rope axis. The growth of this instability can trigger magnetic reconnection, which can explain the formation of chromospheric jets and spicules, but its development has never been investigated in a partially ionized plasma (PIP). Here, we study the kink instability in PIP to understand how it develops in the solar chromosphere, where it is affected by charge-neutral interactions. Partial ionization speeds up the onset of the nonlinear phase of the instability, as the plasma β of the isolated plasma is smaller than the total plasma β of the bulk. The distribution of the released magnetic energy changes in fully ionized plasma and PIP, with a larger increase in internal energy associated with the PIP cases. The temperature in PIP increases faster also due to heating terms from the two-fluid dynamics. PIP effects trigger kink instability on shorter time scales, which is reflected in more explosive chromospheric flux rope dynamics. These results are crucial to understanding the dynamics of small-scale chromospheric structures—minifilament eruptions—that thus far have been largely neglected but could significantly contribute to chromospheric heating and jet formation.

<title>The Lyα Dependence on Nebular Properties from the HETDEX and MOSDEF Surveys</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Investigating the impact of galaxy properties on emergent Lyα emission is crucial for reionization studies, given the sensitivity of Lyα to neutral hydrogen. This study presents an analysis of the physical characteristics of 155 star-forming galaxies, 29 with Lyα detected, and 126 with Lyα not detected with Lyα EW < 20 Å, at z = 1.9–3.5, drawn from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field survey, that have overlapping observations from the Hobby–Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment survey. To unravel the interstellar medium (ISM) conditions in our sample, we developed a custom nebular line modeling algorithm based on the MAPPINGS V photoionization model grid and the emcee framework. Combining nebular-based ISM properties with photometry-based global properties, constrained via Bagpipes, we explore distinctions in the stellar and gas properties between Lyα-detected and Lyα-nondetected galaxies. Our analysis reveals statistically significant differences between the two samples in terms of stellar mass and dust attenuation (AV) at >2σ significance, as determined via a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Moreover, there are weaker (≲1σ significance) indications that the ionization parameter and metallicity differ between the two samples. Our results demonstrate that the escape fraction of Lyα ( ) is inversely correlated with stellar mass, star formation rate, and dust attenuation, while it is positively correlated with the ionization parameter, with significance levels exceeding 2σ. Our findings suggest that the interstellar environments of Lyα-detected galaxies, characterized by low mass, low dust, low gas-phase metallicity, and high ionization parameters, play a pivotal role in promoting the escape of Lyα radiation.

<title>MHD Modeling of a Geoeffective Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection with the Magnetic Topology Informed by In Situ Observations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Variations of the magnetic field within a solar coronal mass ejection (CME) in the heliosphere depend on the CME’s magnetic structure as it leaves the solar corona and its interplanetary evolution. To account for this evolution, we developed a new numerical model of the inner heliosphere that simulates the propagation of a CME through a realistic solar wind background and allows various CME magnetic topologies. To this end, we incorporate the Gibson–Low CME model within our global MHD model of the inner heliosphere, GAMERA-Helio. We apply the model to study the propagation of the geoeffective CME that erupted on 2010 April 3, aiming to reproduce the temporal variations of the magnetic field vector during the CME’s passage by Earth. Parameters of the Gibson–Low CME are informed by STEREO white-light observations near the Sun. The magnetic topology for this CME—the tethered flux rope—is informed by in situ magnetic field observations near Earth. We performed two simulations testing different CME propagation directions. For an in-ecliptic direction, the simulation shows a rotation of all three magnetic field components within the CME, as seen at Earth, similar to that observed. However, the magnitudes of the components, particularly at the back of the CME, are underestimated by the model. With a southward direction, suggested by coronal imaging observations, the Bx component lacks the observed change from negative to positive. In both cases, the model favors the east–west orientation of the flux rope, consistent with the orientation previously inferred from the images from STEREO/Heliospheric Imager.

<title>CLASSY. XI. Tracing Neutral Gas Properties Using UV Absorption Lines and 21 cm Observations*</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Rest-frame far-ultraviolet (FUV) observations from JWST are revolutionizing our understanding of the high-z galaxies that drove reionization and the mechanisms by which they accomplished it. To fully interpret these observations, we must be able to diagnose how properties of the interstellar medium (ISM; e.g., column density, covering fraction, and outflow velocity) directly relate to the absorption features produced. Using the high-signal-to-noise and high-resolution FUV spectra of 45 nearby star-forming galaxies from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph Legacy Spectroscopic Survey, we present the largest uniform, simultaneous characterization of neutral and low-ionization state (LIS) interstellar UV absorption lines (O i, Si ii, S ii, C ii, and Al ii) across a wide range of galaxy properties. We also present 21 cm H i observations for 35 galaxies, multiple of which are gas-poor or nondetected, possibly indicating the onset of a post-starburst phase. We find that our simultaneous one-component Voigt profile fits are capable of accurately modeling the LIS absorption for ∼75% of galaxies, mitigating challenges associated with saturation, infilling, and degeneracies. While the most massive galaxies require additional components, our one-component fits return average properties of the absorbing gas and follow the scaling relations described by a single gas cloud. We explore connections between LIS absorption and direct tracers of the neutral ISM (O i, Lyα, and H i 21 cm), finding that C ii most closely traces the neutral gas trends, while other ions exhibit weaker correlations. Given the challenges with directly observing H i at higher-z, we demonstrate that LIS absorption can be a powerful means to study the neutral ISM and present empirical relationships for predicting neutral gas properties.

<title>NNHMC: An Efficient Stokes Inversion Method Using a Neural Network (NN) Model Combined with the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) Algorithm</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Milne–Eddington (M-E) atmosphere model is commonly adopted in the inversion of the magnetic fields in the solar photosphere. By applying the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm or training a neural network (NN) model, the magnetic field vector can be quickly inferred from the Stokes profile but lacks reliable and statistically well-defined confidence intervals for parameters. To address this, we present an efficient Bayesian inference method called NNHMC, combining the NN model with the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm. The NN model is used to speedily synthesize batches of synthetic Stokes profiles, accelerating the inference process. The HMC algorithm significantly improves sampling efficiency in high-dimensional parameter spaces and can handle large-scale data sets in batches. The spectropolarimetric observation of an active region obtained by the Hinode/spectropolarimeter (SP) is used to demonstrate the capability of the NNHMC method. The strength, inclination, and azimuth of the magnetic field and the line-of-sight velocity inferred with the NNHMC method are very similar to those derived with the MERLIN code. Furthermore, this study provided posterior distributions and uncertainties for these parameters. A test on the same hardware and software platform shows a speed increase of up to 2.5 orders of magnitude with respect to the traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (without the NN, using the M-E atmosphere model), establishing the NNHMC method as a highly effective tool for Stokes inversion based on Bayesian inference.

<title>Electrostatic Solitary Waves in Electronegative Martian Plasma</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The solar wind interacts with planetary magnetospheres, generating plasma waves in both the upstream region and the magnetospheric environment. Mars, lacking an inherent magnetic field, has an induced magnetosphere formed through solar wind interaction with its ionosphere. These waves are crucial for momentum and energy exchange within the planetary plasma environment. This study focuses on the existence and dynamics of electrostatic solitary waves (ESWs) in Martian ionospheric plasma, characterized by various flowing ions. We employ a multifluid plasma model incorporating positive (streaming) ions, negative ions, and two distinct kappa-distributed electron populations to study ESW propagation in the Martian ionosphere from first principles. Linear analysis reveals four distinct modes, including a subsonic mode due to the negative-ion beam. Electrostatic waves may become unstable due to a beam instability excited at long wavelengths. Seeking stationary profile solutions, an energy balance equation is obtained in the moving reference frame, and the shape of the solitary wave can thus be predicted numerically. A meticulous analysis reveals that either positive- or negative-polarity ESWs (or both) may occur (simultaneously) in the Martian environment. In addition to conventional bipolar E-field waveforms, our theoretical model predicts the existence of wiggly bipolar pulses (supersolitary waves) and offset bipolar pulses (flat-top solitary waves) in Martian plasma. Comparison of our model’s predictions with real observational plasma parameters indicates that, like Martian magnetosheath plasma, ionospheric plasma may sustain ESWs measuring several tens of millivolts per meter.

<title>Magnetohydrodynamic Instabilities of Double Magnetic Bands in a Shallow-water Tachocline Model. II. Teleconnection Between High- and Low-latitude Bands and Across Equator</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b50</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The “extended solar cycle” indicates that there are two deeply seated toroidal magnetic field bands in each hemisphere. Both bands migrate equatorward as a sunspot cycle progresses. Here, we examine the consequences of global MHD instability of this migrating double-band system in tachocline on the latitudinal structure of unstable modes, which are essentially MHD Rossby waves. We find that latitude-location, latitude-separation, and the amplitude of the bands strongly influence the latitudinal structure and growth rates of the unstable modes of both symmetries about the equator. These properties can lead to “teleconnections” between low- and high-latitudes in each hemisphere and across the equator. High-latitude bands can destabilize low-latitude bands that would otherwise be stable. Stronger high-latitude bands lead to strong interactions between low and high latitude in each hemisphere, but inhibit cross-equatorial band-interaction. Strong cross-equatorial interactions of modes can synchronize cycle minima in north and south. Symmetric and antisymmetric modes of similar amplitudes can lead to substantial asymmetries between north and south. As a solar cycle progresses, excited MHD Rossby waves go through a sequence of changes in latitude structure and growth rate, while maintaining strong links in latitude. These changes and links are theoretical evidence of teleconnections between widely separated latitudes and longitudes in the Sun, which may explain many of the evolving surface magnetic patterns observed as a solar cycle progresses. The wider the separation between high- and low-latitude bands, the earlier the cross-equatorial teleconnection starts in a cycle, and hence the earlier the cycle starts declining.

<title>NEOWISE-R Caught the Luminous SN 2023ixf in Messier 101</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
During routine survey imaging, the reactivated Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE-R) serendipitously caught the Type II supernova SN 2023ixf in Messier 101 on the rise, starting day 3.6 through day 10.9, and again on the decline at late times from days 211 through 213 and days 370 through 372. We have considered these mid-IR data together with observations from the ultraviolet (UV) through the near-IR, when possible. At day 3.6 we approximated the optical emission with a hot, ∼26,630 K blackbody, with a notable UV excess inferred to result from strong supernova (SN) shock interaction with circumstellar matter (CSM). In the IR, however, a clear excess is also obvious, and we fit it with a cooler, ∼1620 K blackbody with a radius of ∼2.6 × 1015 cm, consistent with dust in the progenitor’s circumstellar shell likely heated by the UV emission from the CSM interaction. On day 10.8, the light detected was consistent with SN ejecta-dominated emission. At late times we also observed a clear NEOWISE-R excess, which could arise either from newly formed dust in the inner ejecta or in the contact discontinuity between the forward and reverse shocks, or from more distant pre-existing dust grains in the SN environment. Furthermore, the large 4.6 μm excess at late times can also be explained by the emergence of the carbon monoxide 1–0 vibrational band. SN 2023ixf is the best-observed SN II in the mid-IR during the first several days after the explosion and one of the most luminous such SNe ever seen.

<title>Magnetic Diagnostics of Prominence Eruptions through the Hanle Effect of the He i 1083 nm Line</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The magnetic field vector of the solar corona is not regularly and comprehensively being measured because of the complexity and degeneracy inherently present in the types of observations currently available. To address some of the current limitations of coronal polarimetry, we present computations that demonstrate the possibility of magnetometry using the unsaturated Hanle effect of the He i 1083 nm line. The main purpose of this investigation is to show how the linear polarization of this line can be used to routinely diagnose the orientation of the field in erupting prominences, thus providing an important constraint on the Bz determination at 1 AU. For this work, we adopted a simplified magnetic model of a flux rope, consisting of a toroidal helical structure embedded in a hydrostatically stratified corona. Our results demonstrate the possibility to discern different orientations of the magnetic field vector in such structures under rather general and practicable viewing conditions. In particular, observations from the Sun–Earth Lagrange points are found to provide excellent locations for the deployment of synoptic instruments aiming at the estimation of the magnetic field of Earth-directed coronal mass ejections. We complete our demonstration by showing how a small (∼5 cm) space-borne coronagraph can achieve sufficient signal-to-noise ratios to make the coronal magnetometry goal outlined above feasible.

<title>Asymmetries in the Simulated Ozone Distribution on TRAPPIST-1e due to Orography</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
TRAPPIST-1e is a tidally locked rocky exoplanet orbiting the habitable zone of an M dwarf star. Upcoming observations are expected to reveal new rocky exoplanets and their atmospheres around M dwarf stars. To interpret these future observations we need to model the atmospheres of such exoplanets. We configured Community Earth System Model version 2–Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 6, a chemistry climate model, for the orbit and stellar irradiance of TRAPPIST-1e assuming an initial Earth-like atmospheric composition. Our aim is to characterize the possible ozone (O3) distribution and explore how this is influenced by the atmospheric circulation shaped by orography, using the Helmholtz wind decomposition and meridional mass streamfunction. The model included Earth-like orography, and the substellar point was located over the Pacific Ocean. For such a scenario, our analysis reveals a north–south asymmetry in the simulated O3 distribution. The O3 concentration is highest at pressures >10 hPa (below ∼30 km) near the south pole. This asymmetry arises from the higher landmass fraction in the northern hemisphere, which causes drag in near-surface flows and leads to an asymmetric meridional overturning circulation. Catalytic species were roughly symmetrically distributed and were not found to be primary driver for the O3 asymmetry. The total O3 column density was higher for TRAPPIST-1e compared to Earth, with 8000 Dobson units (DUs) near the south pole and 2000 DU near the north pole. The results emphasize the sensitivity of O3 to model parameters, illustrating how incorporating Earth-like orography can affect atmospheric dynamics and O3 distribution. This link between surface features and atmospheric dynamics underlines the importance of how changing model parameters used to study exoplanet atmospheres can influence the interpretation of observations.

<title>Are There Black Hole Symbiotic X-Ray Binaries?</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90ab</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90ab</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
While there are over a dozen known neutron star (NS) symbiotic X-ray binaries (SyXBs) in the Galaxy, no SyXBs containing a black hole (BH) have been detected. We address this problem by incorporating binary population synthesis and the accretion properties of BHs fed by the wind from red giant companions. We investigate the impact of different supernova mechanisms, kick velocity distributions, and wind velocities on the formation of both NS and BH SyXBs. Our simulations show that the number of BH SyXBs is at most one-sixth of that of NS SyXBs in the Galaxy provided that the common envelope efficiency parameter α ∼ 0.3–5, and less than ∼10 BH SyXBs could be detectable in X-ray, considering their low radiation efficiencies. These findings indicate a scarcity of BH SyXBs in the Galaxy.

<title>Distribution and Anisotropy of the Energy Transfer Rate in the Solar Wind Turbulence</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90b2</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90b2</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The distribution of the energy transfer rate is critical for the interpretation of the intermittent energy cascade in the solar wind turbulence. However, the true observational distribution of the energy transfer rate in the solar wind and its anisotropy remain unknown. Here, we use a 7 day interval measured by Wind in the fast solar wind and investigate the distribution and anisotropy of the energy transfer rate based on the log-Poisson model. We find that the probability density distribution consists of two parts. The majority part locates at smaller values and is consistent with the log-normal distribution. The estimated mean value and standard deviation of the logarithmic energy transfer rate for the majority are both smaller in the direction parallel to the local mean magnetic field than in the perpendicular direction. The mean value displays a power-law shape with respect to the scale, with flatter index in the parallel direction and steeper index in the perpendicular direction. The minority part locates at larger values and expands as the scale decreases, indicating the growing intermittency toward smaller scales. The flatness for parallel logarithmic energy transfer rate is larger than that for perpendicular. And it rises as the scale decreases for all directions, demonstrating the relatively longer tail of the distribution with decreasing scale. Our results provide new insight to help interpret the intermittent energy cascade process in the solar wind turbulence.

<title>Revisiting the Chemical Composition of WD 1145+017: Impact of Circumstellar Disk Contamination on Photospheric Abundances</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90b7</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad90b7</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We performed a chemical analysis of the asteroid-bearing white dwarf WD 1145+017 using optical and ultraviolet spectroscopic data from 25 epochs between 2015 and 2023. We present an updated gas disk model with improved opacity calculations and temperature profiles to properly account for all circumstellar absorption features. Incorporating these changes into our models, we identified at least 11 elements in the disk, including a detection of circumstellar Na. We detected 16 elements in the photosphere, including new detections of P, Co, and Cu. At 16 elements, WD 1145+017 ties GD 362 as one of the most polluted white dwarfs in terms of the number of elements detected. We find that both the disk and photosphere compositions align, to first order, with CI Chondrite. Our study underscores the importance of accounting for circumstellar absorption, as neglecting them leads to significant abundance errors. Additionally, the analysis of the disk’s opacity highlighted an ultraviolet flux reduction due to a pseudo-continuum due to an optically thick component. This result may affect previous analyses of other polluted white dwarfs, suggesting a need for revisiting some studies.

<title>OCS2 Isomers in the Venusian Atmospheric Chemistry: Spectroscopic Characterization and Photochemistry</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9270</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9270</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The atmosphere of Venus exhibits absorption in the 300–500 nm wavelength range, which is driven by unknown chemical processes. In our study, we explore electronic transitions in molecules that may exist in the Venusian atmosphere, specifically focusing on the photoabsorption cross sections and the lowest singlet and triplet electronic states of the OCS2, SSCO, and OSCS isomers using highly accurate ab initio methods. Our analysis suggests that the SSCO isomer is a strong candidate for explaining the unknown UV absorption. Furthermore, these isomers may serve as significant astrochemical reservoirs in the atmosphere of Venus, where photodissociation could produce atomic sulfur in both its ground and excited states along with OCS and CS2, offering a plausible mechanism for the sulfur cycle dynamics and the formation of Sx species. This study provides valuable insights into the complex sulfur chemistry within the atmosphere of Venus.

<title>COBIPULSE: A Systematic Search for Compact Binary Millisecond Pulsars</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad89a3</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad89a3</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report here the results obtained from a systematic optical photometric survey aimed at finding new compact binary millisecond pulsars (also known as “spiders”): the COmpact BInary PULsar SEarch. We acquired multiband optical images over 1 yr around 33 unidentified Fermi Large Area Telescope sources, selected as pulsar candidates based on their curved GeV spectra and steady γ-ray emission. We present the discovery of four optical variables coinciding with the Fermi sources 3FGL J0737.2−3233, 3FGL J2117.6+3725 (two systems in this field), and 3FGL J2221.6+6507, which we propose as new candidate spider systems. Indeed, they all show optical flux modulation consistent with orbital periods of 0.3548(5), 0.25328(6), 0.441961(2), and 0.165(4) days, respectively, with amplitudes ≳0.3 mag and colors compatible with companion star temperatures of 5000–6000 K. These properties are consistent with the “redback” subclass of spider pulsars. If confirmed as a millisecond pulsar, 3FGL J0737.2−3233 will be the closest known spider to Earth ( , from Gaia-DR3 parallax). We searched and did not find any X-ray sources matching our four candidates, placing 3σ upper limits of ∼1031–1032 erg s−1 (0.3–10 keV) on their soft X-ray luminosities. We also present and discuss other multiwavelength information on our spider candidates, from infrared to X-rays.

<title>JWST/NIRCam Narrowband Survey of Paβ Emitters in the Spiderweb Protocluster at z = 2.16</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the initial result of our Paβ narrowband imaging on a protocluster with the JWST Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam). As NIRCam enables deep narrowband imaging of rest-frame near-infrared lines at z > 1, we target one of the most studied protoclusters, the Spiderweb protocluster at z = 2.16, in which previous studies have confirmed more than a hundred member galaxies. The NIRCam F405N narrowband filter covers in the Paβ line the protocluster redshift given by known protocluster members, allowing for the search for new member candidates. The weight-corrected color–magnitude diagram obtained 57 sources showing narrowband excesses, 41 of which satisfy further color selection criteria for limiting the sample to Paβ emitter candidates at z ∼ 2.16, and 24 of them do not have Hα emitter counterparts. The Paβ emitter candidates appear to follow the spatial distribution of known protocluster members; however, follow-up spectroscopic confirmation is required. Only 17 out of 58 known Hα-emitting cluster members are selected as Paβ emitters in the current data, albeit the rest fall out of the narrowband selection owing to their small Paβ equivalent widths. We derive the Paβ luminosity function in the Spiderweb protocluster, showing a normalization density of at a characteristic Paβ luminosity of . Furthermore, we examine the possibility of detecting faint line emitters visible only in the narrowband image but find no promising candidates.

<title>JWST/NIRCam Paβ Narrowband Imaging Reveals Ordinary Dust Extinction for Hα Emitters within the Spiderweb Protocluster at z = 2.16</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We combine JWST/NIRCam and Subaru/MOIRCS dual Paβ+Hα narrowband imaging to trace the dust attenuation and the star formation activities of a sample of 43 Hα emitters at the core of one of the most massive and best-studied clusters in formation at the cosmic noon: the Spiderweb protocluster at z = 2.16. We find that most Hα emitters display Paβ/Hα ratios compatible with Case B recombination conditions, which translates into nebular extinction values ranging at AV ≈ 0–3 mag, and dust corrected Paβ star formation rates consistent with coeval main sequence field galaxies at fixed stellar mass ( ) during this cosmic epoch. Furthermore, we investigate possible environmental impacts on dust extinction across the protocluster large-scale structure and find no correlation between the dustiness of its members and environmental proxies such as phase-space position, clustercentric radius, or local density. These results support the scenario for which dust production within the main galaxy population of this protocluster is driven by secular star formation activities fueled by smooth gas accretion across its large-scale structure. This downplays the role of gravitational interactions in boosting star formation and dust production within the Spiderweb protocluster, in contrast with observations in higher redshift and less evolved protocluster cores.

<title>Fate of the Remnant in Tidal Stripping Event: Repeating and Nonrepeating</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b24</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b24</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Tidal disruption events (TDE) occur when a star ventures too close to a massive black hole. In a partial TDE (pTDE), the star only grazes the tidal radius, causing the outer envelope of the star to be stripped away while the stellar core survives. Previous research has shown that a star, once tidally stripped in a parabolic orbit, can acquire enough orbital energy for its remnant to become a high-velocity star potentially capable of escaping the galaxy. Conversely, some studies have reported that the remnant may lose orbital energy and undergo re-disruption, leading to a recurring pTDE. This study aims to uncover the physical mechanisms and determine the conditions that lead to these divergent outcomes. We find that the orbital energy change only depends on the impact factor and the stellar structure, and barely depends on the mass of the black hole or the exact mass or orbital eccentricity of the star. For a γ = 5/3 (or γ = 4/3) polytropic star, after a pTDE its remnant gains orbital energy when the impact factor β ≳ 0.62 (or ≳1.1) or loses energy and vice versa. Additionally, we verify an analytical equation for orbital energy change that is applicable across various systems. Through hydrodynamic simulations, we also explore the structure of the stellar remnant post-tidal stripping. Our findings provide critical insights for interpreting observed pTDEs and advancing knowledge on the orbital evolution and event rate of these events.

<title>The Nature of a Recently Discovered Wolf–Rayet Binary: Archetype of Stripping?*</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8a59</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8a59</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
LMCe055-1 was recently discovered in a survey for Wolf–Rayets (WRs) in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and classified as a WN4/O4, a lower-excitation version of the WN3/O3 class discovered as part of the same survey. Its absolute magnitude precluded it from being a WN4+O4 binary. Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment photometry shows shallow primary and secondary eclipses with a 2.2 days period. The spectral characteristics and short period pointed to a possible origin due to binary stripping. Such stripped WR binaries should be common but have proven elusive to identify conclusively. In order to establish its nature, we obtained Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet and Magellan optical spectra, along with imaging. Our work shows that the WR emission and He ii absorption arise in one star, and the He i absorption in another. The He i contributor is the primary of the 2.2 days system and exhibits ∼300 km s−1 radial velocity variations on that timescale. However, the WR star shows 30–40 km s−1 radial velocity variations, with a likely 35 days period and a highly eccentric orbit. Possibly LMCe055-1 is a physical triple, but that would require the 2.2 days pair to have been captured by the WR star. A more likely explanation is that the WR star has an unseen companion in a 35 days orbit and that the 2.2 days pair is in a longer-period orbit about the two. Such examples of multiple systems are well known among massive stars, such as HD 5980. Regardless, we argue that it is highly unlikely that the WR component of the LMCe055-1 system resulted from stripping.

<title>Mining for Protoclusters at z ∼ 4 from Photometric Data Sets with Deep Learning</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8a67</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Protoclusters are high-z overdense regions that will evolve into clusters of galaxies by z = 0, making them ideal for studying galaxy evolution expected to be accelerated by environmental effects. However, it has been challenging to identify protoclusters beyond z = 3 only by photometry due to large redshift uncertainties hindering statistical study. To tackle the issue, we develop a new deep-learning-based protocluster detection model, PCFNet, which considers a protocluster as a point cloud. To detect protoclusters at z ∼ 4 using only optical broadband photometry, we train and evaluate PCFNet with mock g-dropout galaxies based on the N-body simulation with the semianalytic model. We use the sky distribution, i-band magnitude, (g − i) color, and the redshift probability density function surrounding a target galaxy on the sky. PCFNet detects 5 times more protocluster member candidates while maintaining high purity (recall = 7.5% ± 0.2%, precision = 44% ± 1%) than conventional methods. Moreover, PCFNet is able to detect more progenitors ( ) that are less massive than supermassive clusters like the Coma cluster. We apply PCFNet to the observational photometric data set of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Strategic Survey Program Deep/UltraDeep layer (∼17 deg2) and detect 121 protocluster candidates at z ∼ 4. We find that the rest-UV luminosities of our protocluster member candidates are brighter than those of field galaxies, which is consistent with previous studies. Additionally, the quenching of satellite galaxies depends on both the core galaxy’s halo mass at z ∼ 4 and accumulated mass until z = 0 in the simulation. PCFNet is very flexible and can find protoclusters at other redshifts or in future extensive surveys by Euclid, Legacy Survey of Space and Time, and Roman.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We use spectroscopic redshifts obtained with the WIYN 3.5 m telescope to study the local galactic environment around 18 Green Pea (GP) galaxies. Our sample of GPs were discovered in the Hα Dot Survey via their [O iii]λ5007 emission and span the redshift range 0.32 < z < 0.34. We present the environmental analyses near the location of the Hα Dot GPs. We utilize three different density estimators, chosen based on the geometry of the redshift survey data within the Hα Dot GP fields. We classify each Hα Dot GP into an environment category, from extremely isolated to highly clustered. We find that our entire sample of Hα Dot GPs reside in extremely isolated or low-density environments, with none located in the intermediate- to high-density regimes. We interpret this to indicate that major mergers and interactions do not drive the activity seen in these galaxies.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Classical Wolf–Rayet (W-R) stars are the descendants of massive OB stars that have lost their hydrogen envelopes and are burning helium in their cores prior to exploding as Type Ib/c supernovae. The mechanisms for losing their hydrogen envelopes are either through binary interactions or through strong stellar winds potentially coupled with episodic mass loss. Among the bright classical W-R stars, the binary system WR 137 (HD 192641; WC7d + O9e) is the subject of this paper. This binary is known to have a 13 yr period and produces dust near periastron. Here we report on interferometry with the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy Array collected over a decade of time and providing the first visual orbit for the system. We combine these astrometric measurements with archival radial velocities to measure masses of the stars of MWR = 9.5 ± 3.4 M⊙ and MO = 17.3 ± 1.9 M⊙ when we use the most recent Gaia distance. These results are then compared to predicted dust distribution using these orbital elements, which match the observed imaging from JWST as discussed recently by Lau et al. Furthermore, we compare the system to the Binary Population And Spectral Synthesis models, finding that the W-R star likely formed through stellar winds and not through binary interactions. However, the companion O star did likely accrete some material from the W-R star’s mass loss to provide the rotation seen today that drives its status as an Oe star.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the diffusive flow anisotropy vector components for ∼0.5–35 MeV anomalous cosmic-ray (ACR) protons observed during Voyager 2 roll maneuvers for the magnetometer instrument in the inner heliosheath. The diffusive flow results are derived from the differences between the observed anisotropy components presented in A. C. Cummings et al. (2021) and the Compton–Getting anisotropies based on measurements of the solar wind speeds from the Plasma Science instrument. We find that the tangential component of the derived diffusive anisotropy vector is in reasonable agreement, both in direction and magnitude, with a numerical model of the acceleration and transport of ACRs by diffusive shock acceleration along a nonspherical solar wind termination shock (TS). The results suggest that there exists a diffusive flow of these particles from the flank or tail of the heliosphere toward the nose, and support models in which higher-energy ACRs are accelerated in the flank or tail of the TS.

<title>Weak Lensing Analysis of A2390 Using Short Exposures</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad7c4f</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a weak lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster A2390 at z = 0.23 using second moment shape measurements made in 411 short 60 s exposures. The exposures are obtained in three broadband photometric filters (g, r, and i) using WIYN-ODI. Shape measurement in individual exposures is done using a moment-matching algorithm. Forced measurement is used when the moment-matching algorithm fails to converge at low signal-to-noise ratio. The measurements made in individual images are combined using inverse error weighting to obtain accurate shapes for the sources and hence recover shear. We use PhoSim simulations to validate the shear measurements recovered by our pipeline. We find the mass of A2390 is in agreement with previously published results. We also find the E-mode maps show filamentary structures consistent with baryonic structures and recover most clusters/groups of galaxies found using optical and X-ray data. Thus, we demonstrate the feasibility of using weak lensing to map large-scale structure of the Universe. We also find the central portion of the cluster has a bimodal mass distribution and the relative orientation of the peaks is similar to X-ray. We discuss earlier research on this galaxy cluster, and show that a late-stage merger accounts for all the observed data.

<title>Investigation of Individual Pulse Emission Behaviors from Pulsar J1741–0840</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have carried out a detailed study of individual pulse emission from the pulsar J1741−0840 (B1738−08) observed using the Parkes and Effelsberg radio telescopes at the L band. The pulsar exhibits four emission components, which are not well resolved by employing multicomponent Gaussian fitting. The radio emission originates at a height of approximately 1000 km, with the viewing geometry characterized by inclination and impact angles roughly estimated at 81° and 3°, respectively. Fluctuation spectral analysis of single pulse behavior reveals two prominent periodicities, around 32 and five rotation periods. The longer periodic modulation feature is linked to nulling behavior across the entire emission window, with an updated nulling fraction of 23% ± 2% derived from pulse energy distribution via Gaussian mixture modeling. In addition to quasiperiodic nulling, the pulsar also exhibits the presence of subpulse drifting in the trailing component, with the shorter periodic feature in the fluctuation spectra related to the phenomenon of subpulse drifting, and the longitudinal separation estimated to be about 5°. Both periodic modulations show significant temporal evolution with time-dependent fluctuation power. The implications of understanding the radio emission mechanisms are discussed.

<title>Fe/O Variations Relative to Source Longitude and Heliospheric Current Sheet in Large Solar Energetic Particle Events</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad843e</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad843e</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Fe/O enhancements exhibit significant variations in gradual solar energetic particle (SEP) events. Several causes have been suggested including transport effects in the interplanetary space and flare contribution. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the integrated Fe/O ratios of 27 gradual SEP events, locations of associated solar flares, and positions along the heliospheric current sheet (HCS) between 2010 and 2014. We employ synchronic potential field source surface (PFSS) extrapolations at 2.5R⊙, derived in near real-time using Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated far side and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) magnetograms, referred to as AIHMI-PFSS extrapolations. We examine low-energy (∼0.5 MeV/nucleon) Fe and O ion measurements obtained from Suprathermal Ion Telescope on Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatories and Ultra Low Energy Isotope Spectrometer on Advanced Composition Explorer. We found a moderate anticorrelation between the Fe/O ratios and the absolute longitudinal separation angles from the source regions to the spacecraft magnetic footpoints. Furthermore, we investigate the variations in Fe/O ratios with respect to the separation angle, grouped by the same and opposite polarity sectors of the SEP source regions. We found that the mean and median Fe/O values are higher in the same polarity group compared to the opposite polarity group, with the largest contrast at separation angles between 25° and 50°, where the values are approximately 3 times larger. The results imply that the enhanced Fe/O ratios in the examined gradual SEP events are likely associated with direct source regions, while the HCS affects particle transport.

<title>Origins of Very Low Helium Abundance Streams Detected in the Solar Wind Plasma</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad84d6</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The abundance of helium (AHe) in the solar wind exhibits variations typically in the range from 2% to 5% with respect to solar cycle activity and solar wind velocity. However, there are instances where the observed AHe is exceptionally low (<1%). These low-AHe occurrences are detected both near the Sun and at 1 au. The low-AHe events are generally observed near the heliospheric current sheet. We analyzed 28 low-AHe events observed by the Wind spacecraft and 4 by Parker Solar Probe to understand their origin. In this work, we make use of the ADAPT-WSA model to derive the sources of our events at the base of the solar corona. The modeling suggests that the low-AHe events originated from the boundaries of coronal holes, primarily from large quiescent helmet streamers. We argue that the cusp above the core of the streamer can produce such very low helium abundance events. The streamer core serves as an ideal location for gravitational settling to occur as demonstrated by previous models, leading to the release of this plasma through reconnection near the cusp, resulting in low-AHe events. Furthermore, observations from Ulysses provide direct evidence that these events originated from coronal streamers.

<title>Far-side Active Regions Based on Helioseismic and EUV Measurements: A New Data Set for Heliospheric Machine Learning Advancements</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Active Regions (ARs) are regions of strong magnetic flux in the solar atmosphere. Understanding the global evolution of ARs is critical for solar magnetism as well as for accurate space-weather forecasting. We present the first far-side AR data set based on EUV observation and helioseismic measurements. For the EUV observations, we use synchronic maps at 304 Å comprised of observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory/Extreme UltraViolet Imager, in heliocentric orbit with direct vantages into the Sun’s far hemisphere. We used the brightening of the solar transition region in EUV/304 Å maps as a proxy for the magnetic regions. For the far-side helioseismic measurements, we used seismic phase-shift maps of the Sun’s far hemisphere, computed from helioseismic Dopplergrams observed by NSO/Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG). In this study, we present the first global EUV AR data set of the whole Sun, providing several basic parameters, such as location, area, tilt angle, EUV brightness, and latitudinal/longitudinal extents of the identified ARs. We also present a similar data set for the far-side GONG ARs where the helioseismic phase shift parameters are included. Helioseismic far-side GONG ARs are examined, and their success at predicting strong ARs is assessed. We discuss the temporal and spatial evolution for the EUV AR signatures and far-side GONG AR signatures during the ascending and maximum phases of Solar Cycle 24 (2010 May–2016 May). We examine the correlation between the helioseismic signatures and the respective EUV source distributions in the Sun’s far hemisphere. We present the first far-side AR butterfly diagram based on helioseismic measurements.

<title>First Observation of the Complete Rotation Period of the Ultraslowly Rotating Magnetic O Star HD 54879</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad865a</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad865a</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
HD 54879 is the most recently discovered magnetic O-type star. Previous studies ruled out a rotation period shorter than 7 yr, implying that HD 54879 is the second most slowly rotating known magnetic O-type star. We report new high-resolution spectropolarimetric measurements of HD 54879, which confirm that a full stellar rotation cycle has been observed. We derive a stellar rotation period from the longitudinal magnetic field measurements of days (about 7.02 yr). The radial velocity of HD 54879 has been stable over the last decade of observations. We explore equivalent widths and longitudinal magnetic fields calculated from lines of different elements, and conclude the atmosphere of HD 54879 is likely chemically homogeneous, with no strong evidence for chemical stratification or lateral abundance nonuniformities. We present the first detailed magnetic map of the star, with an average surface-magnetic-field strength of 2954 G, and a strength for the dipole component of 3939 G. There is a significant amount of magnetic energy in the quadrupole components of the field (23%). Thus, we find HD 54879 has a strong magnetic field with a significantly complex topology.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
CIZA J2242.8+5301, or the Sausage cluster, is well-studied over a range of frequencies. Since its first discovery, a lot of interesting features and unique characteristics have been uncovered. In this work, we report some more new morphological features using the uGMRT band-3 and band-4 data. In the north relic, we observe variation in the spectral index profiles across the relic width from the east to west, which may indicate a decrease in the downstream cooling rate in that direction. We reconfirm the presence of an additional ∼930 kpc relic in the north. We classify the filamentary source in the downstream region to be a narrow-angle tail (NAT) radio galaxy. The bright arc in the east relic shows a substructure in the spectral index profile, which may indicate the presence of finer filaments. We further report the presence of a double-strand structure in the east relic similar to the “Toothbrush” relic. We categorize the bright “L”-shaped structure in the southern relic to be a NAT radio galaxy, as well as trace the actual ∼1.1 Mpc relic component. We reconfirm the existence of the faint southern extent, measuring the relic length to be ∼1.8 Mpc. Furthermore, we suggest the southern relic to be a union of individual component relics rather than a single giant filamentary relic. Lastly, based on the morphological symmetry between northern and southern relics, we suggest a schematic shock structure associated with the merger event in an attempt to explain their formation scenario.

<title>Connecting the X-Ray/UV Variability of Fairall 9 with NICER: A Possible Warm Corona</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8dc2</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Seyfert 1 active galactic nucleus Fairall 9 was targeted by NICER, Swift, and ground-based observatories for a ∼1000 day long reverberation mapping campaign. The following analysis of NICER spectra taken at a 2 day cadence provides new insights into the structure and heating mechanisms of the central black hole environment. Observations of Fairall 9 with NICER and Swift revealed a strong relationship between the flux of the UV continuum and the X-ray soft excess, indicating the presence of a “warm” Comptonized corona that likely lies in the upper layers of the innermost accretion flow, serving as a second reprocessor between the “hot” X-ray corona and the accretion disk. The X-ray emission from the hot corona lacks sufficient energy and variability to power slow changes in the UV light curve on timescales of 30 days or longer, suggesting an intrinsic disk-driven variability process in the UV and soft X-rays. Fast variability in the UV on timescales shorter than 30 days can be explained through X-ray reprocessing, and the observed weak X-ray/UV correlation suggests that the corona changes dynamically throughout the campaign.

<title>The Impact of Water Clouds on the Prospective Emission Spectrum of Teegarden’s Star b as Observed by LIFE</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8f30</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8f30</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Nontransiting terrestrial planets will be accessible by upcoming observatories of which LIFE is an example. Planet b orbiting Teegarden’s Star is one of the optimal targets for such missions. We use a one-dimensional atmospheric model with real gas radiation, a multispecies pseudo-adiabatic convection-condensation scheme, and a water cloud scheme to estimate the impact of the cloud coverage on the emission spectrum of the target, as well as to assess how sensitive LIFE could be to changes in outgoing flux caused by these clouds. Though the emergent flux decreases with a higher cloud coverage, it does not decrease by more than 1 order of magnitude as the coverage increases from 0% to 90%. This allows LIFE to retain a high sensitivity to the cloud cover fraction for wavelengths longer than 7 μm. In this spectral range, with at least 1 bar of N2, LIFE is able to distinguish cloud cover fractions as small as 10% given an integration time of 24 hr, and yields much better precision with a week-long integration. An integration time of 1 week also allows the resolution of local variations in spectral flux, which can lead to easier molecule identification. This ability remains if the planet is a CO2-dominated Venus analog. Partial pressures of N2 lower than 1 bar may create a degeneracy with the cloud cover fraction. LIFE shows promising potential for detecting and characterizing atmospheres even with a high cloud coverage, and retaining a fine sensitivity to relatively small differences in cloud cover fractions.

<title>Modeling Competing Line-broadening Mechanisms in Neutron Star Atmospheres: Interference between Motional Stark and Ion Broadening</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8f34</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8f34</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Neutron star surfaces have extremely high magnetic fields. In the atmosphere, the broadening of spectral lines will be substantial from the dense plasma as well as from the magnetic field. One broadening mechanism of note is due to the motional Stark effect (MSE)—an additional electric field that arises from the motion of the atom in the magnetic field. However, approximate formulae are often used to construct atmosphere models, and the MSE is assumed to be the dominant line-broadening mechanism even in ions. Detailed pressure-broadening models in these extreme magnetic fields are now currently being developed. In these more detailed models, it was suggested that the MSE may not be as large as previously predicted. If correct, this hypothesis implies that neutron star line widths might be dominated by pressure broadening rather than by motional Stark broadening. We find that, in the absence of plasma perturbations, for typical magnetic fields (B = 1012 G), mid-Z elements, such as oxygen, have motional Stark widths of order 1 eV for transitions between dipole-allowed transitions from the ground state, though higher temperatures and transitions to higher-energy states are expected to have more broadening. The MSE also breaks down selection rules, giving rise to forbidden transitions, which have much larger widths. When plasma perturbations are included, we find that the plasma perturbation and motional Stark processes are not independent and, as a result, the spectral lines become narrow in a nontrivial way and display harmonics of the ion cyclotron frequency.

<title>Evidence for a Sharp CO Snow Line Transition in a Protoplanetary Disk and Implications for Millimeter-wave Observations of CO Isotopologues</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8d55</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8d55</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Observations of CO isotopologue emission from protoplanetary disks at millimeter wavelengths are a powerful tool for probing the CO snow line, an important marker for disk chemistry, and also for estimating total disk gas mass, a key quantity for planet formation. We use simple models to demonstrate that the vertical thickness of an isothermal layer around the disk midplane has important effects on the CO column density radial profile, with a thick layer producing a sharp CO snow line transition. We simulate next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) images to show that this sharp change in the CO column density can be detected in the derivative of the radial profile of emission from optically thin CO isotopologue lines. We apply this method to archival ALMA observations of the disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 163296 in the C17O and C18O J = 1–0 and J = 2–1 lines to identify a sharp CO snow line transition near ∼80 au (0.″8 at 101 pc), and show the CO column density decreases by more than a factor of 20. This finding is consistent with previous inferences from the steep rise of N2H+ emission, which marks the location where CO depletes. We also demonstrate that the disk’s thermal structure introduces significant systematic uncertainty to estimates of total disk gas mass derived from these lines. The substantial improvement in sensitivity envisioned for the ngVLA over ALMA for observations of ground-state lines of CO isotopologues has the potential to extend this approach to a much larger population of disks.

<title>Revealing the Quiescent Galaxy Population in the Spiderweb Protocluster at z = 2.16 with Deep HST/WFC3 Slitless Spectroscopy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 G141 grism slitless spectroscopy observation of the core region of the Spiderweb protocluster at z = 2.16. We analyzed the spectra of all objects in a field of view and identified 40 protocluster members, recovering 19 previously identified Hα emitters in addition to revealing 21 new members. The spectra allowed us to identify 11 galaxies with quiescent spectra. In all, 3 galaxies with quiescent spectra are possibly still star forming according to spectral energy distribution fitting, indicating a possible leftover or dust-obscured star formation. We estimate a quiescent fraction of ∼50% for M⋆ > 1011M⊙. About half of the quiescent galaxies possibly host an active galactic nucleus (AGN), hinting at AGN’s key role in quenching galaxies in the protocluster environment. These quiescent galaxies have relatively more compact and concentrated light profiles than the star-forming members, but they are not yet as bulge dominated as local ellipticals. These results are consistent with previous studies that indicate the Spiderweb protocluster is in the maturing stage, with a red sequence that has begun forming.

<title>Exploring Field-evolution and Dynamical-capture Coalescing Binary Black Holes in GWTC-3</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad83b5</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad83b5</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigate formation channels for merging binary black holes (BBHs) in GWTC-3, with a dedicated semiparametric population model. The model first describes or excludes a high-spin (with magnitudes of ∼0.7) and high-mass (ranging in ∼20–80M⊙) subpopulation, which was identified by previous works and can be interpreted as hierarchical mergers. We find that the rest of BBH population can be categorized into two subpopulations with different mass and mass-ratio distributions, as indicated by a Bayes factor of . One subpopulation, characterized by nearly aligned spins and consistent with isolated field formation, likely dominates the 10-solar-mass peak in the primary-mass function. The other subpopulation, with isotropic spins and consistent with the dynamical channels, shows a stronger preference for symmetric pairing, and mainly contributes to the 35-solar-mass peak in the primary-mass function. Note that the Bayes factor is not high enough with the currently available data, so that the case of a single population is still acceptable. Additionally, we compare the mass distributions between merging BBHs and black holes (BHs) in high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs). We find that the primary mass of the aligned subpopulation is slightly lighter than those of the HMXB BHs, while the isotropic subpopulation is consistent with the HMXB BHs, if the power-law index of its mass function is shifted by 2, as indicated by the dynamical formation channels. However, the spin magnitudes of both subpopulations are significantly smaller than those of the HMXB BHs.

<title>Misaligned Gas Acquisition as a Formation Pathway of S0 Galaxies</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8c3d</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8c3d</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We analyze a sample of 753 S0 galaxies from the MPL-10 of Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory survey and investigate the gas–star kinematic misalignment and merger remnant fraction in galaxies with different morphological types. The misalignment fraction in S0s is the highest among all the morphological types for both young (global Dn4000 < 1.6, ∼15%) and old (global Dn4000 > 1.6, ∼10%) galaxies. We compare the properties of misaligned S0s with other types of galaxies, finding the following: (i) misaligned S0s and misaligned spirals have higher bulge luminosity, higher bulge-to-total light ratio, and larger Sérsic index compared to spirals; (ii) the misaligned S0s have lower bulge luminosity Mr and smaller bulge size than merger remnant S0s, while aligned S0s have the widest coverage for these parameter distributions, which are overlapped with both misaligned S0s and merger remnant S0s; (iii) misaligned S0s have lower stellar mass M* and more isolated environment than aligned S0s and merger remnant S0s; and (iv) the young misaligned S0s have positive Dn4000 radial gradient, while the aligned S0s and merger remnant S0s show negative Dn4000 radial gradient. Combining all these observational results, we suggest misaligned gas acquisition as another efficient formation pathway for S0 galaxies. The redistribution of gas angular momentum during gas–gas collision between accreted and preexisting gas leads to gas inflow and the growth of the bulge component, while the lack of cold gas at the outskirts leads to fading of spiral arms.

Small planets (≲1 M⊕) at intermediate orbital distances (∼1 au) represent an uncharted territory in exoplanetary science. The upcoming microlensing survey by the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will be sensitive to objects as light as Ganymede and unveil the small planet population at 1–10 au. Instrumental sensitivity to such planets is low, and the number of objects we will discover is strongly dependent on the underlying planet mass function. In this work, we provide a physically motivated planet mass function by combining the efficiency of planet formation by pebble accretion with the observed disk mass function. Because the disk mass function for M dwarfs (0.4–0.6 M⊙) is bottom heavy, the initial planet mass function is also expected to be bottom heavy, skewing toward Ganymede and Mars mass objects, more so for heavier initial planetary seeds. We follow the subsequent dynamical evolution of planetary systems over ∼100 Myr varying the initial eccentricity and orbital spacing. For initial planet separations of ≥3 local disk scale heights, we find that Ganymede and Mars mass planets do not grow significantly by mergers. However, Earth-like planets undergo vigorous merging and turn into super-Earths, potentially creating a gap in the planet mass function at ∼1 M⊕. Our results demonstrate that the slope of the mass function and the location of the potential gap in the mass function can probe the initial architecture of multiplanet systems. We close by discussing implications on the expected difference between bound and free-floating planet mass functions.

<title>On the Influence of the Solar Wind on the Propagation of Earth-impacting Coronal Mass Ejections</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8e63</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are subject to changes in their direction of propagation, tilt, and other properties as they interact with the variable solar wind. We investigated the heliospheric propagation of 15 Earth-impacting CMEs observed during 2010 April to 2018 August in the field of view (FOV) of the Heliospheric Imager (HI) on board the STEREO. About half of the 15 events followed self-similar expansion up to 40 R⊙. The remaining events showed deflection either in latitude, longitude, or a tilt change. Only 2 events showed significant rotation in the HI1 FOV. We also use toroidal and cylindrical flux rope fitting on the in situ observations of interplanetary magnetic field and solar wind parameters to estimate the tilt at L1 for these 2 events. Although the sample size is small, this study suggests that CME rotation is not very common in the heliosphere. We attributed the observed deflections and rotations of CMEs to a combination of factors, including their interaction with the ambient solar wind and the influence of the ambient magnetic field. These findings contribute to our understanding of the complex dynamics involved in CME propagation and highlight the need for comprehensive modeling and observational studies to improve space weather prediction. In particular, HI observations help us to connect observations near the Sun and near the Earth, improving our understanding of how CMEs move through the heliosphere.

<title>Accurately Estimating Redshifts from CSST Slitless Spectroscopic Survey Using Deep Learning</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8bbf</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) has the capability to conduct a slitless spectroscopic survey simultaneously with a photometric survey. The spectroscopic survey will measure slitless spectra, potentially providing more accurate estimations of galaxy properties, particularly redshifts, compared to using broadband photometry. CSST relies on these accurate redshifts to use baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) and other probes to constrain the cosmological parameters. However, due to the low resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of slitless spectra, measurement of redshifts is significantly challenging. In this study, we employ a Bayesian neural network (BNN) to assess the accuracy of redshift estimations from slitless spectra anticipated to be observed by CSST. The simulation of slitless spectra is based on real observational data from the early data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI-EDR) and the 16th data release of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS-DR16), combined with the 9th data release of the DESI Legacy Survey (DESI LS DR9). The BNN is constructed employing a transfer learning technique, by appending two Bayesian layers after a convolutional neural network, leveraging the features learned from the slitless spectra and corresponding redshifts. Our network can provide redshift estimates along with corresponding uncertainties, achieving an accuracy of σNMAD = 0.00063, outlier percentage η = 0.92%, and weighted mean uncertainty . These results successfully fulfill the requirement of σNMAD < 0.005 for BAO and other studies employing CSST slitless spectroscopic surveys.

Relativistic jets manifest some of the most intriguing activities in the nuclear regions of active galaxies. Identifying the most powerful relativistic jets permits us to probe the most luminous accretion systems and, in turn, the most massive black holes. This paper reports the identification of one such object, PMN J1310−5552 (z = 1.56), a blazar candidate of uncertain type detected with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) and Swift Burst Alert Telescope. The detection of broad emission lines in its optical spectra taken with the X-Shooter and Goodman spectrographs classifies it to be a flat-spectrum radio quasar. The analysis of the Goodman optical spectrum has revealed PMN J1310−5552 harbors a massive black hole (log scale MBH = 9.90 ± 0.07, in M⊙) and luminous accretion disk (log scale Ldisk = 46.86 ± 0.03, in erg s−1). The fitting of the observed big blue bump with the standard accretion disk model resulted in the log scale MBH (in M⊙) and Ldisk (in erg s−1), respectively. These parameters suggest PMN J1310−5552 hosts one of the most massive black holes and the most luminous accretion disks among the blazar population. The physical properties of this enigmatic blazar were studied by modeling the broadband spectral energy distribution considering the data from NuSTAR, Swift, Fermi-LAT, and archival observations. Overall, PMN J1310−5552 is a powerful “MeV” blazar with physical parameters similar to other members of this unique class of blazars. These results provide glimpses of monsters lurking among the unknown high-energy emitters and demonstrate the importance of ongoing wide-field sky surveys to discover them.

<title>The Second Case of a Major Merger Triggering a Starburst in a Green Pea Galaxy</title>

We have used the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to map H i 21 cm emission from the Green Pea galaxy GP J1148+2546 at z ≈ 0.0451, only the second measurement of the H i spatial distribution of a Green Pea. The VLA H i 21 cm image, the DECaLS optical image, and Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy show that GP J1148+2546 has two neighbors, the nearer of which is only ≈17.5 kpc away, and that the H i 21 cm emission extends in an inverted “C” shape around the Green Pea and its companions, with the highest H i column density between the two neighboring galaxies. The starburst in GP J1148+2546 is likely to have been triggered by the ongoing merger with its neighbors, although the velocity field and velocity dispersion images do not show clear merger signatures at the Green Pea location. The H i mass of the Green Pea and its immediate surroundings is (3.58 ± 0.37) × 109M⊙, a factor of ≈7.4 lower than the total H i mass of the system of three interacting galaxies, while the H i depletion timescale of GP J1148+2546 is ≈0.69 Gyr, much shorter than that of typical galaxies at z ≈ 0. We detect damped Lyα absorption and Lyα emission from the Green Pea in a Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph spectrum, obtaining a high H i column density, ≈2.0 × 1021 cm−2, and a low Lyα escape fraction, ≈0.8%, consistent with the relatively low value (≈5.4) of the ratio O32 ≡ [O iii]λ5007 + λ4959/[O ii]λ3727,3729.

Disk galaxies viewed as thin planar structures resulting from the conservation of angular momentum of an initially rotating pregalactic cloud allow merely a first-order model of galaxy formation, but the presence of vertically extended structures has allowed us to gather a deeper understanding of the richness in astrophysical processes (e.g., minor mergers, secular evolution) that ultimately results in the observed diversity in disk galaxies and their vertical extensions. We measure the stellar disk scale height of 46 edge-on spiral galaxies from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S4G) project. This paper aims to investigate the radial variation of the stellar disk vertical scale height and the existence of the so-called thick disk component in our sample. The measurements were made using one-, two-, and three-dimensional profile fitting techniques using simple models. We found that two-thirds of our sample show the presence of a thick disk, suggesting that these galaxies have been accreting gaseous material from their surroundings. We found an average thick-to-thin disk scale height ratio of 2.65, which is in good agreement with previous studies. Our findings also support the disk flaring model, which suggests that the vertical scale height increases with radius. We further found good correlations between the scale height hz and the scale length and between hz and the optical de Vaucouleurs radius R25.

<title>Observational Signatures of AGN Feedback in the Morphology and the Ionization States of Milky Way-like Galaxies</title>

We make an in-depth analysis of different active galactic nuclei (AGN) jet models’ signatures, inducing quiescence in galaxies with a halo mass of 1012M⊙. Three jet models, including cosmic-ray-dominant, hot thermal, and precessing kinetic jets, are studied at two energy flux levels each, compared to a jet-free, stellar feedback-only simulation. Each of our simulations is idealized isolated galaxy simulations with AGN jet powers that are constant in time and generated using GIZMO and with FIRE stellar feedback. We examine the distribution of Mg ii, O vi, and O viii ions, alongside gas temperature and density profiles. Low-energy ions, like Mg ii, concentrate in the interstellar medium (ISM), while higher energy ions, e.g., O viii, prevail at the AGN jet cocoon’s edge. High-energy flux jets display an isotropic ion distribution with lower overall density. High-energy thermal or cosmic-ray jets pressurize at smaller radii, significantly suppressing core density. The cosmic-ray jet provides extra pressure support, extending cool and warm gas distribution. A break in the ion-to-mass ratio slope in O vi and O viii is demonstrated in the ISM-to-circumgalactic medium (CGM) transition (between 10 and 30 kpc), growing smoothly toward the CGM at greater distances.

<title>Strong Chemical Tagging in FIRE: Intra- and Intercluster Chemical Homogeneity in Open Clusters in Milky Way–like Galaxy Simulations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8bac</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Open-star clusters are the essential building blocks of the Galactic disk; “strong chemical tagging”—the premise that all star clusters can be reconstructed given chemistry information alone—is a driving force behind many current and upcoming large Galactic spectroscopic surveys. In this work, we characterize the abundance patterns for nine elements (C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ca, and Fe) in open clusters (OCs) in three galaxies (m12i, m12f, and m12m) from the Latte suite of FIRE-2 simulations, to investigate the feasibility of strong chemical tagging in these simulations. We select young massive (≥104.6M⊙) OCs formed in the last ∼100 Myr and calculate the intra- and intercluster abundance scatter for these clusters. We compare these results with analogous calculations drawn from observations of OCs in the Milky Way. We find the intracluster scatter of the observations and simulations to be comparable. While the abundance scatter within each cluster is minimal (≲0.020 dex), the mean abundance patterns of different clusters are not unique. We also calculate the chemical difference in intra- and intercluster star pairs and find it, in general, to be so small that it is difficult to distinguish between stars drawn from the same OC or from different OCs. Despite tracing three distinct nucleosynthetic families (core-collapse supernovae, white dwarf supernovae, and stellar winds), we conclude that these elemental abundances do not provide enough discriminating information to use strong chemical tagging for reliable OC membership.

<title>Comparison of the Chemical Compositions between the Bright and Faint Red Clumps for the Metal-poor and Metal-rich Populations in the Milky Way Bulge</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We examined the double red clump (RC) observed in the Galactic bulge, interpreted as a difference in distance (“X-shaped bulge scenario”) or in chemical composition (“multiple population scenario”). To verify chemical differences between the RC groups, we performed low-resolution spectroscopy for RC and red giant branch (RGB) stars using Gemini-South/GMOS in three fields of the bulge and collected diverse data from the literature. We divided our sample stars not only into bright RC (bRC) and faint RC (fRC) groups, but also into bluer ([Fe/H] < −0.1) and redder ([Fe/H] > −0.1) groups following recent u-band photometric studies. For the metal-poor stars, no statistically significant difference in the CN index was detected between the bright and faint RC groups for all observed fields. However, we found, from crossmatching with high-resolution spectroscopic data, a sign of Na enhancement in the “metal-poor and bright” RC group compared to the “metal-poor and faint” group at (l, b) = (−1°, −8.°5). When the contributions of the RGB stars on the RC regimes are taken into account, the Na abundance difference between genuine RCs would correspond to Δ[Na/Fe] ≃ 0.23 dex, similar to a globular cluster (GC) with multiple populations. In contrast, the metal-rich stars do not show chemical differences between the bright and faint RC groups. This implies that the double RC observed in the metal-poor component of the bulge might be linked to the multiple populations originating from GC-like subsystems, whereas that of the metal-rich component would have been produced by the X-shaped structure. Our results support previous studies suggesting the composite nature of the Milky Way bulge.

<title>Detection Rate of Galaxy Cluster-lensed Stellar Binary Black Hole Mergers by the Third-generation Gravitational-wave Detectors</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b44</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b44</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Gravitational waves (GWs) from stellar binary black hole (sBBH) mergers can be strongly gravitational lensed by intervening galaxies/galaxy clusters. Only a few works have investigated cluster-lensed sBBH mergers by adopting oversimplified models, while galaxy-lensed ones have been intensively studied. In this paper, we estimate the detection rate of cluster-lensed sBBH mergers with third-generation GW detectors and its dependence on the lens models. We adopt detailed modeling of galaxy cluster lenses by using the mock clusters in the Synthetic Sky Catalog for Dark Energy Science with LSST (cosmoDC2) and/or approximations of the pseudo-Jaffe profile or an eccentric Navarro–Frenk–White dark matter halo plus a bright central galaxy with singular isothermal sphere profile. Considering that the formation of sBBH mergers is dominated by the evolution of the massive binary star (EMBS) channel, we find that the detection rate of cluster-lensed sBBHs is ∼5–84 yr−1, depending on the adopted lens model and uncertainty in the merger rate density, which is about yr−1 if adopting relatively more realistic galaxy clusters with central main and member galaxies in the cosmoDC2 catalog, close to the estimated detection rate of sBBH mergers lensed by galaxies. In addition, we also consider the case in which the production of sBBH mergers is dominated by the dynamical interactions in dense stellar systems. We find that the detection rate of cluster-lensed sBBHs from the dynamical channel is about 1.5 times larger than that from the EMBS channel, and the redshift distribution of the former peaks at a higher redshift (∼3) compared with that from the latter (∼2).

<title>Simulations of the Collision between a Debris Stream and an Outer Dusty Torus: A Possible Channel for Forming a Fast-rise and Long-delay Radio Outburst in Tidal Disruption Events</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8ba5</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8ba5</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A geometrically thick dusty torus structure is believed to exist in the nuclear regions of galaxies (especially in active galactic nuclei). The debris stream from a tidal disruption event (TDE) will possibly collide with the dusty torus and produce a transient flare. We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to model the dynamical evolution of the interaction between unbound debris and a dusty torus. During the continuous interaction, shocked material will be spilled out from the interaction region and form an outflow. We calculate the temporal evolution of synchrotron emission by assuming that the shock accelerates a fraction of electrons in the outflow into a nonthermal distribution. We find that radio emission from the debris–torus collision generates a steep-rise and slow-decline radio light curve due to the sharp edge and dense gas of the dusty torus, where the radio outburst is delayed relative to the main optical/X-ray outburst by several years or even several tens of years. We apply our model to a TDE that happened in a narrow-line Seyfert I galaxy (PS16dtm), where both the radio spectrum and the light curve can be roughly reproduced. Future high-sensitivity, wide-field-of-view radio surveys have the opportunity to detect more such radio flares.

<title>Dynamics Around Supermassive Black Holes: Extreme-mass-ratio Inspirals as Gravitational-wave Sources</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Supermassive black holes and their surrounding dense stellar environments nourish a variety of astrophysical phenomena. We focus on the distribution of stellar-mass black holes around the supermassive black hole and the consequent formation of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). We derive a steady-state distribution, considering the effects of two-body scattering and gravitational-wave emission, and calculate the EMRI formation rate, eccentricity distribution, and EMRI-to-plunge ratio. Our model predicts: (a) a stronger segregation than previously estimated at the outskirts of the sphere of influence (at ∼0.01–2 pc for a Milky Way–like galaxy); (b) an increased EMRI-to-plunge ratio, favoring EMRIs at galaxies where stellar-mass black holes are scarce; (c) a detection of about 2 × 103 resolvable EMRIs, with a signal-to-noise ratio above 20, along a 4 yr LISA mission time; and (d) a confusion noise, induced by a cosmological population of unresolved EMRIs, reducing the LISA sensitivity in the 1–5 mHz frequency range by up to a factor of ≈2, relative to the instrumental noise.

<title>Post-Keplerian Perturbations of the Hyperbolic Motion in the Field of a Rotating Massive Object: Analysis in Terms of Osculating and Nonosculating (Contact) Elements</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the general relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense–Thirring components of the gravitational field of a rotating massive body are analytically worked out to the first post-Newtonian level in terms of the osculating Keplerian orbital elements. To the Newtonian order, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as well. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation in space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the primary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied to ‘Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system along an unbound heliocentric orbit, and to the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous spacecraft during its flyby of the Earth. The calculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any alternative models of gravity as well.

<title>Search for High-excitation Emission Lines from a Quasar-scale Active Nucleus in Arp 220</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The late-stage galaxy merger and prototypical ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) Arp 220 is probed using the JWST Mid Infrared Instrument medium-resolution spectrometer to search for multiple diagnostic active galactic nuclei (AGN) emission lines in the low-interstellar-opacity spectral ranges of 5.3–7.9 μm and 12.9–16.0 μm. We detect none of the characteristic high-excitation AGN emission lines. The most diagnostic nondetections are of the [Ne vi] λ 7.652 μm and [Ne v] λ 14.32 μm lines, for which the combined upper limit is ∼10–20 times fainter than the equivalent limit from Spitzer data. We also use X-ray measurements of the reflected Fe Kα line to suggest a relatively low X-ray luminosity. These results suggest that the high obscuration observed along the line of sight to the nuclei of Arp 220 is isotropic and keeps any high-excitation emission from a putative AGN from escaping. An implication is that the observed mid-infrared output of the nuclei is essentially their bolometric luminosity, i.e., no significant additional energy escapes. We utilize this result to show that any embedded AGNs are accreting at no more than ∼5% of the Eddington rate, lower than many theoretical predictions for this stage of ULIRG evolution.

<title>Viscous Transonic Accretion Flows in Kerr Black Hole Geometry</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad84dd</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad84dd</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We study viscous transonic accretion flows in vertical equilibrium in Kerr geometry. We employ the pseudo-Kerr formalism that accurately describes transonic flows around Kerr black holes and is applicable for modeling observational data. We study the effects of viscosity on the nature of sonic points and the parameter space that allows an accretion flow to possess multiple sonic points. We concentrate on the accretion solutions that can have centrifugal pressure supported shock waves and find that the shocks are weaker and are located farther from the black hole as the viscosity is enhanced. Moreover, if the viscosity is greater than a critical value, shocks do not form and the accretion flow can pass only through the inner sonic point close to the black hole and remains subsonic and Keplerian throughout the accretion disk. Since the resonance oscillation frequencies of the shock waves provide a measure of the observed quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) frequencies, and since the location of shock waves depend on the spin of a black hole, it is clear that the QPO frequencies must depend on the spin of black hole as well. Our pseudo-Kerr approach makes it easier to compute spectra from an accretion flow with viscous dissipation and radiative cooling around a spinning black hole.

<title>Volatile Element Depletion of Carbonaceous Chondrites—Insights from Mass-dependent Zinc, Cadmium, and Tellurium Isotope Variations</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad87ed</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad87ed</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The origin of volatile depletion in the solar system remains a topic of intense debate. To further inform our understanding of the mechanisms involved, this study characterized the mass-dependent Zn, Cd, and Te isotope compositions and concentrations of a comprehensive suite of carbonaceous chondrites (CCs). In accord with previous studies, Zn and Te display covariations between light isotope enrichments and elemental depletions. Observed here for the first time, Cd shows a similar trend. These correlations are consistent with the interpretation that the primary volatile element budgets of CCs were established by mixing of a volatile-rich CI-like matrix and a volatile-depleted non-matrix endmember (NME) in the solar nebula. All three elements display minor isotopic variations in CI and CM chondrites, as a consequence of aqueous alteration at low temperatures. In contrast, Cd and Te isotope compositions and concentrations are highly variable in CV and CO (Cd) and CK chondrites (Te). This reflects mobilization of the elements during thermal metamorphism at distinct redox conditions. The data of this study show that the NME has Zn, Cd, and Te concentrations that are depleted to an identical level of 0.12 ± 0.03 × CI chondrites, and it is characterized by mass-dependent isotope compositions for all three elements that are fractionated to light isotope values relative to CIs by a similar extent. In conjunction with literature data, this suggests that the concentrations and isotope compositions of NME volatiles record the same depletion processes, and that the NME volatile inventory is likely hosted predominantly in chondrules.

<title>Signature of Vertical Mixing in Hydrogen-dominated Exoplanet Atmospheres</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Vertical mixing is a crucial disequilibrium process in exoplanet atmospheres, significantly impacting chemical abundance and observed spectra. While current state-of-the-art observations have detected its signatures, the effect of vertical mixing on atmospheric spectra varies widely based on planetary parameters. In this study, we explore the influence of disequilibrium chemistry across a parameter space that includes eddy diffusion, surface gravity, internal and equilibrium temperature, and metallicity. We also assess the effectiveness of retrieval models in constraining the eddy diffusion coefficient. By running numerous 1D chemical kinetics models, we investigate the impact of vertical mixing on the transmission spectrum. We also built a custom fast-forward disequilibrium model, which includes vertical mixing using the quenching approximation and calculates the model abundance orders of magnitude faster than the chemical kinetics model. We coupled this forward model with an open-source atmospheric retrieval code, used it on the JWST simulated output data of our chemical kinetics model, and retrieved eddy diffusion coefficient, internal temperature, and atmospheric metallicity. We find that there is a narrow region in the parameter space in which vertical mixing has a large effect on the atmospheric transmission spectrum. In this region of the parameter space, the retrieval model can put high constraints on the transport strength and provide optimal exoplanets to study vertical mixing. In addition, the NH3 abundance can be used to constrain the internal temperature for equilibrium temperature Tequi > 1400 K.

<title>MAGAZ3NE: Massive, Extremely Dusty Galaxies at z ∼ 2 Lead to Photometric Overestimation of Number Densities of the Most Massive Galaxies at 3 < z < 4*</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present rest-frame optical spectra from Keck/MOSFIRE and Keck/NIRES of 16 candidate ultramassive galaxies targeted as part of the Massive Ancient Galaxies at z > 3 Near-Infrared Survey (MAGAZ3NE). These candidates were selected to have photometric redshifts 3 ≲ zphot <4, photometric stellar masses > 11.7, and well-sampled photometric spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the UltraVISTA and VIDEO surveys. In contrast to previous spectroscopic observations of blue star-forming and poststarburst ultramassive galaxies, candidates in this sample have very red SEDs implying significant dust attenuation, old stellar ages, and/or active galactic nuclei (AGN). Of these galaxies, eight are revealed to be heavily dust-obscured 2.0 < z < 2.7 galaxies with strong emission lines, some showing broad features indicative of AGN, three are Type I AGN hosts at z > 3, one is a z ∼ 1.2 dusty galaxy, and four galaxies do not have a confirmed spectroscopic redshift. In fact, none of the sample has ∣zspec − zphot∣ < 0.5, suggesting difficulties for photometric redshift programs in fitting similarly red SEDs. The prevalence of these red interloper galaxies suggests that the number densities of high-mass galaxies are overestimated at z ≳ 3 in large photometric surveys, helping to resolve the “impossibly early galaxy problem” and leading to much better agreement with cosmological galaxy simulations. A more complete spectroscopic survey of ultramassive galaxies is required to pin down the uncertainties on their number densities in the early Universe.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We have developed a new method of multiwavelength data combination for the search of late-type radio dwarfs, and have put it into practice using GLEAM-X DR1 data. The initial sample is selected by cross-matching the Gaia/DR3 objects with the probability of being a star no less than 99%, and removing the extragalactic objects assigned by the SIMBAD database. The late-type dwarf stars are judged according to their location in the (BP − RP)0/MG color–magnitude diagram and in the (J − H)0/(K − W1)0 near-infrared color–color diagram. Furthermore, stellar activity is searched by ultraviolet excess in the GALEX/NUV band and the Rossby number in the TESS light curves. In total, 12 stars are found to be late-type dwarf stars associated with radio source, which consists of five stars with UV excess and seven stars with a Rossby number less than 0.13. Three of these 12 stars are previously studied to be associated with radio objects. All these 12 stars are considered to be reliable counterparts of radio sources.

<title>zoomies: A Tool to Infer Stellar Age from Vertical Action in Gaia Data</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Stellar age measurements are fundamental to understanding a wide range of astronomical processes, including Galactic dynamics, stellar evolution, and planetary system formation. However, extracting age information from main-sequence stars is complicated, with techniques often relying on age proxies in the absence of direct measurements. The Gaia data releases have enabled detailed studies of the dynamical properties of stars within the Milky Way, offering new opportunities to understand the relationship between stellar age and dynamics. In this study, we leverage high-precision astrometric data from Gaia DR3 to construct a stellar age prediction model based only on stellar dynamical properties, namely the vertical action. We calibrate two distinct, hierarchical stellar age–vertical action relations, first employing asteroseismic ages for red-giant-branch stars, then isochrone ages for main-sequence turn-off stars. We describe a framework called zoomies based on this calibration, by which we can infer ages for any star given its vertical action. This tool is open-source and intended for community use. We compare dynamical age estimates from zoomies with age measurements from open clusters and asteroseismology. We use zoomies to generate and compare dynamical age estimates for stars from the Kepler, K2, and TESS exoplanet transit surveys. While dynamical age relations are associated with large uncertainty, they are generally mass independent and depend on homogeneously measured astrometric data. These age predictions are uniquely useful for large-scale demographic investigations, especially in disentangling the relationship between planet occurrence, metallicity, and age for low-mass stars.

<title>Multiphase Gas Nature in the Sub-parsec Region of the Active Galactic Nuclei. III. Eddington Ratio Dependence on the Structures of Dusty and Dust-free Outflows</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b42</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b42</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigated the influence of the Eddington ratio on sub-parsec-scale outflows in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with supermassive black holes (SMBHs) masses of 107 M⊙ using two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations. When the range of the Eddington ratio is γEdd > 10−3, the radiation force exceeds the gas pressure, leading to stronger outflows and larger dust sublimation radius. Although the sub-parsec-scale outflows are a time-dependent phenomenon, our simulations demonstrated that the radial distributions can be well explained by the steady solutions of the spherically symmetric stellar winds. The dynamic structure of sub-parsec-scale outflows is influenced by the dust sublimation radius and the critical radii determined by the dynamical equilibrium condition. Although significantly affecting the outflow velocity, the Eddington ratio exerts minimal effects on temperature and number density distribution. Furthermore, our analytical solutions highlight the importance of the dust sublimation scale as a crucial determinant of terminal velocity and column density in dusty outflows. Through comparisons of our numerical model with the obscuring fraction observed in nearby AGNs, we reveal insights into the Eddington ratio dependence and the tendency toward the large obscuring fraction of the dusty and dust-free gases. The analytical solutions are expected to facilitate an understanding of the dynamical structure and radiation structures along the line of sight and their viewing angles from observations of ionized outflows.

<title>KIC 10855535: An Elegant δ Scuti Pulsator with Amplitude and Phase Modulation</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b4c</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We investigated the pulsating behavior of KIC 10855535 using Kepler 4 yr long-cadence data. Two independent frequencies were detected: a pulsation frequency F0 = 17.733260(5) day−1 and a low frequency f8 = 0.412643(8) day−1. We identify F0 as the fundamental frequency, at which an equidistant quintuplet is centered, suggesting that the star orbits in a binary system. The fitted orbital parameters align well with those reported in previous literature. Long-term phase modulation caused by binarity has been confirmed by considering the light curve from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. By removing the light-time effect, we measured a linear change in period of order , a value that could be indicative of stellar evolution. The star also exhibits a gradual and stable amplitude growth, thereby raising the possibility of structural changes during its evolution. We attributed f8 and its two harmonics to rotation and surface spots, with further analysis suggesting characteristics evolving over time. Based on this hypothesis, KIC 10855535 may rotate slowly for its type, with a speed of 37(2) km s−1. Overall, KIC 10855535 presents an exceptionally clean spectrum and a relatively slow rotation as a δ Sct pulsator, exhibiting a single pulsation mode that undergoes both amplitude and phase modulation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this paper, we present a statistical study of the [C ii] 158 μm line and the CO(1−0) emission for a sample of ∼200 local and high-z (32 sources with z > 1) galaxies with very different physical conditions. We explore the correlation between the luminosities of [C ii] and CO(1−0) lines and obtain a strong linear relationship, confirming that [C ii] is able to trace total molecular gas mass, with a small difference between (U)LIRGs and less-luminous galaxies. The tight and linear relation between [C ii] and CO(1−0) is likely determined by the average value of the observed visual extinction AV and the range of G0/n in galaxies. Further investigations into the dependence of L[C ii]/LCO(1−0) on different physical properties show that L[C ii]/LCO(1−0) (1) anticorrelates with ΣIR, and the correlation becomes steeper when ΣIR ≳ 1011L⊙ kpc−2; (2) correlates positively with the distance from the main sequence Δ(MS) when Δ(MS) ≲ 0; and (3) tends to show a systematically smaller value in systems where the [C ii] emission is dominated by ionized gas. Our results imply that caution needs to be taken when applying a constant [C ii]-to-Mmol conversion factor to estimate the molecular gas content in extreme cases, such as galaxies having low-level star formation activity or high star formation rate surface density.

<title>Detection of Diffuse Hot Gas around the Young, Potential Superstar Cluster H72.97–69.39</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the first Chandra X-ray observations of H72.97–69.39, a highly embedded, potential superstar cluster in its infancy located in the star-forming complex N79 of the Large Magellanic Cloud. We detect particularly hard, diffuse X-ray emission that is coincident with the young stellar objects identified with JWST, and the hot gas fills cavities in the dense gas mapped by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The X-ray spectra are best fit with either a thermal plasma or power-law model, and assuming the former, we show that the X-ray luminosity of LX = (1.0 ± 0.3) × 1034 erg s−1 is a factor of ∼20 below the expectation for a fully confined wind bubble. Our results suggest that stellar wind feedback produces diffuse hot gas in the earliest stages of massive star cluster formation and that wind energy can be lost quickly via either turbulent mixing followed by radiative cooling or by physical leakage.

<title>Absolute Dimensions of the Interferometric Binary HD 174881: A Test of Stellar Evolution Models for Evolved Stars</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8dcc</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report high-resolution spectroscopic monitoring and long-baseline interferometric observations with the Palomar Testbed Interferometer (PTI) of the 215 day binary system HD 174881 (K1 II-III), composed of two giant stars. The system is spatially resolved with the PTI, as well as in archival measurements with the CHARA Array. Our analysis of these observations, along with an analysis of the spectral energy distribution, have allowed us to infer accurate values for the absolute masses ( and ), radii (34.0 ± 1.3 and 22.7 ± 1.8 R☉), effective temperatures (4620 ± 100 and 4880 ± 150 K), and bolometric luminosities of both components, as well as other properties including the orbital parallax (distance). These provide valuable tests of stellar evolution models for evolved stars, which are still relatively uncommon compared to the situation for main-sequence stars. We find generally good agreement of all of these properties of HD 174881 with two sets of recent models (MIST and PARSEC) at compositions near solar, for ages of 255–273 Myr. We also find evidence of an infrared excess, based largely on the flux measurements from IRAS at 60 and 100 μm.

<title>Neutrino Detection Rates from Lepto-hadronic Model Simulations of Bright Blazar Flares</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8dce</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8dce</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
There is mounting evidence that blazars are the sources of part of the very-high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux detected by IceCube. In particular, there have been several spatial and temporal coincidences of individual IceCube neutrino events with flaring blazars, the most prominent of them being IceCube-170922A, coincident with a multiwavelength flare of TXS 0506+056. Motivated by this, we used the time-dependent lepto-hadronic code OneHaLe to model the spectral energy distributions and light curves of a sample of bright γ-ray flares of blazars detected by Fermi-Large Area Telescope, for which Kreter et al. provided calorimetric estimates of the expected neutrino detection rates. Flares were modeled with temporal changes of the proton injection spectra. Our analysis shows that the calorimetric approach overestimates the increase in neutrino production by a factor of typically ∼10 if the γ-ray emission is dominated by proton-synchrotron radiation.

<title>Astrophysical Properties of the Sirius Binary System Modeled with MESA</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8dd6</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky and, despite its proximity, this binary system still imposes intriguing questions about its current characteristics and past evolution. H. E. Bond et al. published decades of astronometric measurements of the Sirius system, determining the dynamical masses for Sirius A and B, and the orbital period. We have used these determinations, combined with photometric determinations for luminosity and spectroscopic determinations of effective temperature (Teff) and metallicity, to model the evolution of the Sirius system using Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics. We have constructed a model grid calculated especially for this system and were able to obtain, for Sirius B, a progenitor mass of 6.0 ± 0.6 M⊙, yielding a white dwarf mass of 1.015 ± 0.189 M⊙. Our best determination for the age of the system is 203.6 ± 45 Myr with a metallicity of 0.0124. We have compared our best-fit models with the ones computed using TYCHO, YREC, and PARSEC, establishing external uncertainties. Our results are consistent with the observations and support a noninteracting past.

<title>Strong Coupling of Hydrodynamics and Reactions in Nuclear Statistical Equilibrium for Modeling Convection in Massive Stars</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8a66</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8a66</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We build on the simplified spectral deferred corrections (SDC) coupling of hydrodynamics and reactions to handle the case of nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE) and electron/positron captures/decays in the cores of massive stars. Our approach blends a traditional reaction network on the grid with a tabulated NSE state from a very large, nuclei network. We demonstrate how to achieve second-order accuracy in the simplified-SDC framework when coupling NSE to hydrodynamics, with the ability to evolve the star on the hydrodynamics time step. We discuss the application of this method to convection in massive stars leading up to core collapse. We also show how to initialize the initial convective state from a 1D model in a self-consistent fashion. All of these developments are done in the publicly available Castro simulation code and the entire simulation methodology is fully GPU-accelerated.

<title>Investigating the Potential of LS 5039 as a Triple System Using Fermi-LAT Data</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad7bb6</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad7bb6</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
LS 5039 is one of a handful of γ-ray binary systems in the milky Way, comprising a pulsar and a massive O-type companion star with an orbital period of 3.9 days. Recently, we conducted a data analysis using approximately 16 yr of Fermi Large Area Telescope observations, spanning from 2008 August 4 to 2024 July 8. In our timing analysis, we discovered two new periodic signals with frequencies higher and lower than the known orbital period. The higher-frequency signal has a period of 3.63819 days with a 7.1σ confidence level, while the lower-frequency signal has a period of 4.21654 days with a 6.3σ confidence level. Additionally, in data from the High Energy Stereoscopic System of Cherenkov telescopes, two potential signals are found with periods similar to the two newly discovered ones. Considering that these two signals fall within the same frequency interval as the orbital period, we suggest the possibility of a third body orbiting the barycenter of the LS 5039 binary system, with the new periodic signals arising from specific frequency combinations of the two orbital periods.

<title>Radial Evolution of Non-Maxwellian Electron Populations Derived from Quasi-thermal Noise Spectroscopy: Parker Solar Probe Observations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Understanding the transport of energy within space plasmas, particularly in the solar wind, remains a complex challenge. Accurate measurement of electron temperatures and their nonthermal characteristics is crucial for comprehending energy transport properties in plasmas. Quasi-thermal-noise (QTN) spectroscopy has emerged as a dependable tool for precise electron parameters assessment as it is less susceptible to spacecraft effects than particle detectors. In this study, we apply a QTN spectroscopy fitting method to analyze data from the Parker Solar Probe FIELDS radio instrument obtained during Encounters 2 through 13, under unbiased antenna conditions. We use the kappa function to characterize the electron velocity distribution and employ a fitting technique to derive the changes in each parameter across heliocentric distances ranging from 12 Rs to 76 Rs. Specifically, we find that the electron density scales as ne ∝ r−2.09±0.04 and the Te ∝ r−0.65±0.02. The distribution of the kappa index has three distinct regions as a function of radial distance from the Sun. Furthermore, we conduct a statistical analysis of solar wind energy flux which we finds follows a power-law relationship wtotal ∝ r−1.92±0.04.

<title>Characterizing the Broadband Reflection Spectrum of MAXI J1803-298 during Its 2021 Outburst with NuSTAR and NICER</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad82e9</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad82e9</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
MAXI J1803-298 is a transient black hole candidate discovered in 2021 May during an outburst that lasted several months. Multiple X-ray observations reveal recurring “dipping” intervals in several of its light curves, particularly during the hard/intermediate states, with a typical recurrence period of ∼7 hr. We report analysis of four NuSTAR observations of the source, supplemented with NICER data where available, over the duration of the outburst evolution covering the hard, intermediate, and the soft states. Reflection spectroscopy reveals the black hole to be rapidly spinning (a* = 0.990 ± 0.001) with a near edge-on viewing angle (i = 70° ± 1°). Additionally, we show that the light-curve dips are caused by photoelectric absorption from a moderately ionized absorber whose origin is not fully understood, although it is likely linked to material from the companion star impacting the outer edges of the accretion disk. We further detect absorption lines in some of the spectra, potentially associated with Fe xxv and Fe xxvi, indicative of disk winds with moderate to extreme velocities. During the intermediate state and just before transitioning into the soft state, the source showed a sudden flux increase, which we found to be dominated by soft disk photons and consistent with the filling of the inner accretion disk, at the onset of state transition. In the soft state, we show that models of disk self-irradiation provide a better fit and a preferred explanation to the broadband reflection spectrum, consistent with previous studies of other accreting sources.

<title>Evolution of Cataclysmic Variables with Binary-driven Mass Loss during Nova Eruptions</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8880</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8880</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The discrepancies between observations and theoretical predictions of cataclysmic variables (CVs) suggest that there exists unknown angular-momentum-loss mechanism(s) besides magnetic braking and gravitational radiation. Mass loss due to nova eruptions belongs to the most likely candidates. While standard theory assumes that mass is lost in the form of radiation-driven, optically thick wind (fast wind), recent numerical simulations indicate that most of the mass loss is initiated and shaped by binary interaction. We explore the effect of this binary-driven mass loss (BDML) on the CV evolutions assuming a major fraction of the lost mass leaves the system from the outer Lagrangian point. Different from the traditional continuous wind picture, we consider the mass loss process to be instantaneous because the duration of nova eruptions is much shorter than the binary evolutionary timescale. Our detailed binary evolution calculations reveal the following results. (1) BDML seems able to provide extra angular momentum loss below the period gap. The mass transfer rates at a given orbital period occupy a large range, in agreement with the observed secular mass transfer rate distribution in CVs. (2) The enhanced mass transfer rates do not lead to a runaway mass transfer process and allow the white dwarfs to grow mass ≲0.1 M☉. (3) BDML can cause both positive and negative variations in the orbital period induced by nova eruptions, in line with observations, and can potentially explain the properties of some peculiar supersoft X-ray sources likely CAL 87, 1E 0035.4−7230, and RX J0537.7−7034.

<title>The JCMT BISTRO Survey: The Magnetic Fields of the IC 348 Star-forming Region</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad88ed</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad88ed</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present 850 μm polarization observations of the IC 348 star-forming region in the Perseus molecular cloud as part of the B-fields In STar-forming Region Observation survey. We study the magnetic properties of two cores (HH 211 MMS and IC 348 MMS) and a filamentary structure of IC 348. We find that the overall field tends to be more perpendicular than parallel to the filamentary structure of the region. The polarization fraction decreases with intensity, and we estimate the trend by power law and the mean of the Rice distribution fittings. The power indices for the cores are much smaller than 1, indicative of possible grain growth to micron size in the cores. We also measure the magnetic field strengths of the two cores and the filamentary area separately by applying the Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi method and its alternative version for compressed medium. The estimated mass-to-flux ratios are 0.45–2.20 and 0.63–2.76 for HH 211 MMS and IC 348 MMS, respectively, while the ratios for the filament are 0.33–1.50. This result may suggest that the transition from subcritical to supercritical conditions occurs at the core scale (∼0.05 pc) in the region. In addition, we study the energy balance of the cores and find that the relative strength of turbulence to the magnetic field tends to be stronger for IC 348 MMS than for HH 211 MMS. The result could potentially explain the different configurations inside the two cores: a single protostellar system in HH 211 MMS and multiple protostars in IC 348 MMS.

<title>BD+44°493: Chemo-dynamical Analysis and Constraints on Companion Planetary Masses from WIYN/NEID Spectroscopy*</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this work, we present high-resolution (R ∼ 100,000), high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ∼ 800) spectroscopic observations for the well-known, bright, extremely metal-poor, carbon-enhanced star BD+44°493. We determined chemical abundances and upper limits for 17 elements from WIYN/NEID data, complemented with 11 abundances redetermined from Subaru and Hubble data, using the new, more accurate, stellar atmospheric parameters calculated in this work. Our analysis suggests that BD+44°493 is a low-mass (0.83 M⊙), old (12.1–13.2 Gyr) second-generation star likely formed from a gas cloud enriched by a single metal-free 20.5 M⊙ Population III star in the early Universe. With a disk-like orbit, BD+44°493 does not appear to be associated with any major merger event in the early history of the Milky Way. From the precision radial-velocity NEID measurements (median absolute deviation = 16 m s−1), we were able to constrain companion planetary masses around BD+44°493 and rule out the presence of planets as small as MJ out to periods of 100 days. This study opens a new avenue of exploration for the intersection between stellar archaeology and exoplanet science using NEID.

<title>Multiwavelength Emission from Jets and Magnetically Arrested Disks in Nearby Radio Galaxies: Application to M87</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad88f4</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Radio galaxies are a subclass of active galactic nuclei that drive relativistic jets from their center and are observed in radio to very-high-energy gamma rays. The emission mechanisms and regions are still unknown. High-energy gamma rays can be explained by the emission from the magnetically arrested disks (MADs) around the central supermassive black hole (BH), for which the magnetic flux threading the BH is in a saturation level, although the emission from the MADs does not explain the optical and X-ray data. We construct a two-zone multiwavelength emission model in which optical and X-rays come from jets, while millimeter/submillimeter and gamma rays come from MADs. Our model takes into account the particle injection by the magnetic reconnection at the jet base close to the BH and particle entrainment from the ambient gas at the jet emission zone. We apply our model to M87 and find that our model can explain the simultaneous multiwavelength data, except for the radio data, which could be explained if we extend our one-zone emission model to a one-dimensional one. We also find that the strong plasma entrainment is necessary to explain the multiwavelength data. Our model will be tested by variability analysis among the multiwavelength data.

<title>Constraining the Location of the γ-Ray Emission Region in Radio-loud AGN 3C 380</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad891e</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad891e</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A detailed broadband spectral and temporal study of a radio-loud active galactic nucleus, 3C 380, is carried out using 14.5 yr of Fermi-LAT data, available Swift observations, and data from other observatories, including AstroSat (2020 August). The source exhibited a GeV outburst on 2020 September 5. Given the sparsity of Swift observations, no useful correlations could be established between γ-ray, X-ray, and UV/optical bands. The source is also a part of the Monitoring of Jets in Active Galactic Nuclei with VLBA Experiments survey and has been monitored at 15 GHz for over a decade. The correlation studies show that radio emission lags γ-rays by ∼150 days. We constrain the location of γ-ray emission by the core shift measurements from the literature and the observed time delays. Using this localization, we constructed and modeled the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of the source during its high γ-ray activity states and for the long-term averaged state. The SEDs during the high γ-ray activity states are modeled with two zones: one corresponding to the “steady” or the emission from the source averaged over more than a decade and another corresponding to the “flare” emission. We conclude that the high-energy emission originates within the parsec-scale jet, and moving shocks in the region drive the observed γ-flux variations.

<title>Observations of Preferential Heating and Acceleration of α-particles in the Young Solar Wind by Parker Solar Probe</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Remote sensing observations of the nascent solar wind in the solar corona imply that heavy ions are often faster and hotter than the plasma protons. In situ observations of the near-Earth solar wind with low collisional age show that hotter and faster states of heavy ions usually do not occur at the same time: heavy ions are either faster or hotter than the protons. This discrepancy highlights the need to understand the competing effects of heating, acceleration, Coulomb collisions, and instabilities on heavy ions in the inner heliosphere, from the solar corona to Earth. The Parker Solar Probe (PSP) is currently the closest spacecraft to the Sun and is anticipated to cross the outer boundary of the preferential heating and acceleration zone. Using in situ measurements from PSP, we find that larger drift speeds between α-particles and protons (Vαp) correspond to larger α-to-proton temperature ratios ( ) in the young solar wind close to the corona. This observation differs from in situ observations farther from the Sun (e.g., with Helios and Wind at 0.3–1 au). We believe that this difference is related to the speed of the solar wind, as well as the distance from the Sun. The anti-correlation between Vαp and in fast wind away from the Sun is potentially related to the energy transfer from the drift kinetic energy of α-particles to proton thermal energy due to drift instabilities. In the young slow wind, heavy ions exhibit signs of both preferential heating and preferential acceleration, but are not affected much by drift instabilities. We identify the outer boundary of the preferential heating and acceleration zone for heavy ions in the young slow wind to be at a distance of around 0.16 au, beyond which the effects of Coulomb collisions weaken the effects of preferential heating and acceleration.

<title>Transition Region Brightening in a Moss Region and Their Relation with Lower Atmospheric Dynamics</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Small-scale brightenings (SBs) are commonly observed in the transition region (TR) that separates the solar chromosphere from the corona. These brightenings, omnipresent in active region patches known as “moss” regions, could potentially contribute to the heating of active region plasma. In this study, we investigate the properties of SB events in a moss region and their associated chromospheric dynamics, which could provide insights into the underlying generation mechanisms of the SBs. We analyzed the data sets obtained by coordinated observations using the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph and the Goode Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory. We studied 131 SB events in our region of interest and found that 100 showed spatial and temporal matches with the dynamics observed in the chromospheric Hα images. Among these SBs, 98 of them were associated with spicules that are observed in Hα images. Furthermore, detailed analysis revealed that one intense SB event corresponded to an Ellerman bomb (EB), while another SB event consisted of several recurring brightenings caused by a stream of falling plasma. We observed that Hα far wings often showed flashes of strong brightening caused by the falling plasma, creating an Hα spectral profile similar to an EB. However, 31 of the 131 investigated SB events showed no noticeable spatial and temporal matches with any apparent features in Hα images. Our analysis indicated that the predominant TR SB events in moss regions are associated with chromospheric phenomena primarily caused by spicules. Most of these spicules display properties akin to dynamic fibrils.

<title>Neural Network Constraints on the Cosmic-Ray Ionization Rate and Other Physical Conditions in NGC 253 with ALCHEMI Measurements of HCN and HNC</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad85db</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad85db</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We use a neural network model and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of HCN and HNC to constrain the physical conditions, most notably the cosmic-ray ionization rate (CRIR, ζ), in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the starburst galaxy NGC 253. Using output from the chemical code UCLCHEM, we train a neural network model to emulate UCLCHEM and derive HCN and HNC molecular abundances from a given set of physical conditions. We combine the neural network with radiative transfer modeling to generate modeled integrated intensities, which we compare to measurements of HCN and HNC from the ALMA Large Program ALCHEMI. Using a Bayesian nested sampling framework, we constrain the CRIR, molecular gas volume and column densities, kinetic temperature, and beam-filling factor across NGC 253's CMZ. The neural network model successfully recovers UCLCHEM molecular abundances with ∼3% error and, when used with our Bayesian inference algorithm, increases the parameter-inference speed tenfold. We create images of these physical parameters across NGC 253's CMZ at 50 pc resolution and find that the CRIR, in addition to the other gas parameters, is spatially variable with ζ ∼ a few ×10−14 s−1 at r ≳ 100 pc from the nucleus, increasing to ζ > 10−13 s−1 at its center. These inferred CRIRs are consistent within 1 dex with theoretical predictions based on nonthermal emission. Additionally, the high CRIRs estimated in NGC 253's CMZ can be explained by the large number of cosmic-ray-producing sources as well as a potential suppression of cosmic-ray diffusion near their injection sites.

The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way is fed by gas inflows from the Galactic disk along almost radial trajectories aligned with the major axis of the Galactic bar. However, despite being fundamental to all processes in the nucleus of the Galaxy, these inflows have been studied significantly less than the CMZ itself. We present observations of various molecular lines between 215 and 230 GHz for 20 clouds with ∣ℓ∣ < 10°, which are candidates for clouds in the Galactic bar due to their warm temperatures and broad lines relative to typical Galactic disk clouds, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Atacama Compact Array. We measure gas temperatures, shocks, star formation rates, turbulent Mach numbers, and masses for these clouds. Although some clouds may be in the Galactic disk despite their atypical properties, nine clouds are likely associated with regions in the Galactic bar, and in these clouds, turbulent pressure is suppressing star formation. In clouds with no detected star formation, turbulence is the dominant heating mechanism, whereas photoelectric processes heat the star-forming clouds. We find that the ammonia (NH3) and formaldehyde (H2CO) temperatures probe different gas components, and in general, each transition appears to trace different molecular gas phases within the clouds. We also measure the CO-to-H2 X-factor in the bar to be an order of magnitude lower than the typical Galactic value. These observations provide evidence that molecular clouds achieve CMZ-like properties before reaching the CMZ.

<title>GOALS-JWST: The Warm Molecular Outflows of the Merging Starburst Galaxy NGC 3256</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) integral-field spectrograph observations of NGC 3256, a local infrared-luminous late-stage merging system with two nuclei roughly 1 kpc apart, both of which have evidence of cold molecular outflows. Using JWST/NIRSpec and Mid-Infrared Instrument data sets, we investigate this morphologically complex system on spatial scales of <100 pc, where we focus on the warm molecular H2 gas surrounding the nuclei. We detect collimated outflowing warm H2 gas originating from the southern nucleus, though we do not find significant outflowing H2 gas surrounding the northern nucleus. We measure maximum intrinsic outflow velocities of ∼1000 km s−1, which extend out to a distance of 0.7 kpc. Based on H2 S(7)/S(1) ratios, we find a larger fraction of warmer gas near the southern nucleus, which decreases with increasing distance from the nucleus, signifying the southern nucleus as a primary source of H2 heating. The gas mass of the warm H2 outflow component is estimated to be Mwarm,out = (1.4 ± 0.2) × 106M⊙, as much as 6% of the cold H2 mass estimated using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array CO data. The outflow timescale is about 7 × 105 yr, resulting in a mass outflow rate and kinetic power Pwarm,out ∼ 4 × 1041 erg s−1. Lastly, regions within our 3.″0 × 3.″0 NIRSpec data, where the outflowing gas reside show high [Fe ii]/Paβ and H2/Brγ line ratios, indicate enhanced mechanical heating caused by the outflows. The fluxes and ratios of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in these regions are not significantly different compared to those elsewhere in the disk, suggesting the outflows may not significantly alter the PAH ionization state or grain size.

<title>A Buddy for Betelgeuse: Binarity as the Origin of the Long Secondary Period in α Orionis</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad87f4</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad87f4</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We predict the existence of α Ori B, a low-mass companion orbiting Betelgeuse. This is motivated by the presence of a 2170 day long secondary period (LSP) in Betelgeuse’s lightcurve, a periodicity that is ≈5 times longer than the star’s 416 day fundamental radial pulsation mode. While binarity is currently the leading hypothesis for LSPs in general, the LSP and the radial velocity (RV) variations observed in Betelgeuse, taken together, necessitate a revision of the prevailing physical picture. Specifically, the lightcurve–RV phase difference requires a companion to be behind Betelgeuse at the LSP luminosity minimum, ≈180° out of phase with the system orientation associated with occultation. We demonstrate the consistency of this model with available observational constraints and identify tensions in all other proposed LSP hypotheses. Within this framework, we calculate a mass for α Ori B of and an orbital separation of 1850 ± 70 R⊙, or times the radius of Betelgeuse. We then describe the features of the companion as constrained by the fundamental parameters of Betelgeuse and its orbital system, and discuss what would be required to confirm the companion’s existence observationally.

<title>Sun-as-a-Star Spectral Line Variability in the 300–2390 nm Wavelength Range</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Combining the near-daily Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) measurements of solar spectra, we construct line indices (line-core to line-flanks ratios) for various transitions (mainly Fe i) in the 300–2390 nm spectral domain. The indices are supplemented by the wavelength-binned fluxes from OMI and Total and Spectral Solar Irradiance Sensor (TSIS-1). To study the short-term (solar-rotational) patterns, we normalize the indices and fluxes to the minimum-activity epoch, then de-trend them with 81 day running means. Comparisons of the de-trended TSIS-1 and OMI fluxes with the NASA-NOAA-LASP SSI (NNLSSI1) model show excellent agreement, to (0.5–2.2) × 10−4 in the normalized and de-trended data. The data are subjected to a multiregression analysis against quantities representing the facular brightening and the sunspot darkening. The de-trended line indices and average fluxes show different sensitivities to these two solar magnetic-activity manifestations, with the fluxes being far more susceptible to the sunspot component. The de-trended line indices experience a rapid drop of activity levels towards longer wavelengths, albeit with a large rebound in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) domain that is caused by the ubiquitous, temperature-sensitive CO transitions. The wavelength-dependent activity also falls, however much slower, in the de-trended average fluxes. Qualitatively similar behavior is captured by semiempirical models.

<title>Constraints on Common Envelope Ejection from Double Helium White Dwarfs</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad88ef</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad88ef</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Double helium white dwarfs (He WDs) are a type of gravitational wave source and are greatly important in studies of binary interaction, particularly in common envelope (CE) ejection physics. Most double He WDs with mass ratios of q ∼ 1 are formed through a particular channel. In this channel, one He WD is initially produced from a red giant (RG) with a degenerate core via stable Roche lobe overflow, and another He WD is formed from an RG with a degenerate core via CE ejection. They may have significant implications for binary evolution processes but have not received specific studies, especially for the CE phase. This paper adopts a semianalytic method and a detailed stellar evolution simulation to model the formation of double He WDs. We find that most double He WDs show mass ratios slightly greater than 1, and their orbital period–mass ratio relations are broadly consistent with observations. There is also a relation between the mass ratios and progenitor masses of the He WDs produced via CE ejection for double He WDs with determined WD masses. Based on this relation, the mass of the He WD progenitor can be inferred from the mass ratio. Then, the CE ejection efficiency can be constrained with the orbital period. In addition, we constrain the CE ejection efficiency for two double He WDs, J1005-2249 and WD0957-666. The results show that the CE ejection efficiencies increase with the WD progenitor masses.

<title>Identifying New High-confidence Polluted White Dwarf Candidates Using Gaia XP Spectra and Self-organizing Maps</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The identification of new white dwarfs (WDs) polluted with heavy elements is important since they provide a valuable tool for inferring the chemical properties of putative planetary systems accreting material on their surfaces. The Gaia space mission has provided us with an unprecedented amount of astrometric, photometric, and low-resolution (XP) spectroscopic data for millions of newly discovered stellar sources, among them thousands of WDs. In order to find WDs among these data and to identify which ones have metals in their atmospheres, we propose a methodology based on an unsupervised artificial intelligence technique called self-organizing maps. In our approach, a nonlinear high-dimensional data set is projected on a 2D grid map where similar elements fall into the same neuron. By applying this method, we obtained a clean sample of 66,337 WDs. We performed an automatic spectral classification analysis on them, obtaining 143 bona fide polluted WD candidates not previously classified in the literature. The majority of them are cool WDs and we identify in their XP spectra several metallic lines such as Ca, Mg, Na, Li, and K. The fact that we obtain similar precision metrics to those achieved with recent supervised techniques highlights the power of our unsupervised approach to mine the Gaia archives for hidden treasures to follow up spectroscopically with higher resolution.

<title>Mass Function of Stellar Black Holes as Revealed by the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA Observations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Ninety gravitational-wave events have been detected by the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA network and are released in the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog. Among these events, 83 cases are definitely binary black hole mergers, since the masses of all the objects involved significantly exceed the upper limit of neutron stars. The black holes in these merger events naturally form two interesting samples, a premerger sample that includes all the black holes before the mergers and a postmerger sample that consists of the black holes generated during the merging processes. The former represents black holes that once existed in the Universe, while the latter represents newly born black holes. Here we present a statistical analysis of these two samples. The nonparametric τ statistic method is adopted to correct for the observational selection effect. The Lynden-Bell C− method is further applied to derive the mass distribution and density function of black holes. It is found that the mass distribution can be expressed as a broken power-law function. More interestingly, the power-law index in the high-mass region is comparable for the two samples. The number density of black holes is found to depend on redshift as ρ(z) ∝ z−2.06—z−2.12 based on the two samples. The implications of these findings on the origin of black holes are discussed.

<title>Estimating the Masses of Supercluster-scale Filaments from Redshift Dispersions</title>

<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8ba8</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a strategy for estimating the mass per unit length along supercluster-scale filaments that are oriented across the sky, based on mock redshift surveys of 264 filaments from the Millennium simulation. In our fiducial scenario, we place each simulated filament at a distance of 300 Mpc, perpendicular to the line of sight, and calculate the redshift dispersion using galaxies with magnitudes r < 19.5. Some regions are dynamically complicated in ways that interfere with finding a simple relationship between dispersion σ and linear mass density μ. However, by examining individual overlapping segments along the filaments, we find a relationship that allows us to successfully predict from with a scatter of about ±0.20 dex, for ∼70% of the regions along filaments. This relationship is robust to changes in the distance to the filament if the physical segment length and the absolute magnitude for galaxy selection are held constant. The relationship between redshift dispersion and mass is similar to that obtained for a simple analytical model where filaments are dynamically relaxed, and we examine the possibility that the galaxies are indeed relaxed within the gravitational potential of the filament. We find that this is not the case; galaxy dynamics are strongly affected by infall to the filament and by orbits within groups and clusters.

<title>Efficient and Accurate Force Replay in Cosmological-baryonic Simulations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We construct time-evolving gravitational potential models for a Milky Way–mass galaxy from the FIRE-2 suite of cosmological-baryonic simulations using basis function expansions. These models capture the angular variation with spherical harmonics for the halo and azimuthal harmonics for the disk, and the radial or meridional plane variation with splines. We fit low-order expansions (four angular/harmonic terms) to the galaxy’s potential for each snapshot, spaced roughly 25 Myr apart, over the last 4 Gyr of its evolution, then extract the forces at discrete times and interpolate them between adjacent snapshots for forward orbit integration. Our method reconstructs the forces felt by simulation particles with high fidelity, with 95% of both stars and dark matter, outside of self-gravitating subhalos, exhibiting errors ≤4% in both the disk and the halo. Imposing symmetry on the model systematically increases these errors, particularly for disk particles, which show greater sensitivity to imposed symmetries. The majority of orbits recovered using the models exhibit positional errors ≤10% for 2–3 orbital periods, with higher errors for orbits that spend more time near the galactic center. Approximate integrals of motion are retrieved with high accuracy even with a larger potential sampling interval of 200 Myr. After 4 Gyr of integration, 43% and 70% of orbits have total energy and angular momentum errors within 10%, respectively. Consequently, there is higher reliability in orbital shape parameters such as pericenters and apocenters, with errors ∼10% even after multiple orbital periods. These techniques have diverse applications, including studying satellite disruption in cosmological contexts.

<title>Water Enrichment from Pebble Drift in Disks with Gap-forming Planets</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad891d</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad891d</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Volatiles like H2O are present as ice in solids in the cold outer regions of protoplanetary disks and as vapor in the warm inner regions within the water snow line. Icy pebbles drifting inwards from the outer disk sublimate after crossing the snow line, enriching the inner disk with solid mass and water vapor. Meanwhile, protoplanets forming within the disk open gaps in the disk gas, creating traps against the inward drift of pebbles and in turn reducing water enrichment in the inner disk. Recent disk observations from millimeter interferometry and infrared spectroscopy have supported this broad picture by finding a correlation between the outer radial distribution of pebbles and the properties of inner water vapor spectra. In this work, we aim at further informing previous and future observations by building on previous models to explore pebble drift in disks with multiple gaps. We systematically explore multiple gap locations and their depths (equivalent to the specific masses of planets forming within), and different particle sizes to study their impact on inner disk water enrichment. We find that the presence of close-in deep gaps carved by a Jupiter-mass planet is likely crucial for blocking icy pebble delivery into the inner disk, while planets with lower masses only provide leaky traps. We also find that disks with multiple gaps show lower vapor enrichment in the inner disk. Altogether, these model results support the idea that inner disk water delivery and planet formation are regulated by the mass and location of the most massive planets.

<title>Testable Predictions of Outside-in Age Gradients in Dwarf Galaxies of All Types</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We use a sample of 73 simulated satellite and central dwarf galaxies spanning a stellar mass range of 105.3–109.1M⊙ to investigate the origin of their stellar age gradients. We find that dwarf galaxies often form their stars “inside-out,” i.e., the stars form at successively larger radii over time. However, the oldest stars get reshuffled beyond the star-forming radius by fluctuations in the gravitational potential well caused by stellar feedback (the same mechanisms that cause dwarfs to form dark matter cores). The result is that many dwarfs appear to have an “outside-in” age gradient at z = 0, with younger stellar populations more centrally concentrated. However, for the reshuffled galaxies with the most extended star formation, young stars can form out to the large radii to which the old stars have been reshuffled, erasing the age gradient. We find that major mergers do not play a significant role in setting the age gradients of dwarfs. We find similar age gradient trends in satellites and field dwarfs, suggesting that environment plays only a minor role, if any. Finally, we find that the age gradient trends are imprinted on the galaxies at later times, suggesting that the stellar reshuffling dominates after the galaxies have formed 50% of their stellar mass. The later reshuffling is at odds with results from the fire-2 simulations. Hence, age gradients offer a test of current star formation and feedback models that can be probed via observations of resolved stellar populations.

<title>21cmlstm: A Fast Memory-based Emulator of the Global 21 cm Signal with Unprecedented Accuracy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Neural network (NN) emulators of the global 21 cm signal need an emulation error much less than the observational noise in order to be used to perform unbiased Bayesian parameter inference. To this end, we introduce 21cmLSTM—a long short-term memory (LSTM) NN emulator of the global 21 cm signal that leverages the intrinsic correlation between frequency channels to achieve exceptional accuracy compared to previous emulators, which are all feedforward, fully connected NNs. LSTM NNs are a type of recurrent NN designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. When trained and tested on the same simulated set of global 21 cm signals as the best previous emulators, 21cmLSTM has an average relative rms error of 0.22%—equivalently 0.39 mK—and comparably fast evaluation time. We perform seven-dimensional Bayesian parameter estimation analyses using 21cmLSTM to fit global 21 cm signal mock data with different adopted observational noise levels, σ21. The posterior 1σ rms error is ≈three times less than σ21 for each fit and consistently decreases for tighter noise levels, showing that 21cmLSTM can sufficiently exploit even very optimistic measurements of the global 21 cm signal. We have made the emulator, code, and data sets publicly available so that 21cmLSTM can be independently tested and used to retrain and constrain other 21 cm models.

<title>Evidence for a Close-in Tertiary Orbiting around the Algol-type System HZ Dra with Tidal Splitting and Spots Activities</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We report a cyclic variation of the O − C diagram with a semiamplitude of 0.0033 days and a period of 1.05 yr for the pulsating eclipsing binary HZ Dra. The cyclic variation can be explained by the light travel-time effect via the presence of a close-in third body orbiting around HZ Dra in an elliptical orbit with a maximum semimajor axis of 0.89 au. Based on the Wilson–Devinney code, the contribution of the third light to the total system is determined to be 29.0%, which is in agreement with the estimated value. Our light-curve modeling indicates an evolving hot and cool spot on the surface of the primary and secondary components, respectively. Their positions are roughly symmetrical to the inner Lagrangian point L1, which could be used to explain the variation in the O'Connell effect. Our frequency analysis detects one radial p-mode, seven nonradial p-modes, and one nonradial g-mode. In addition, a total of six multiplets are identified, spaced by the orbital frequency, which can be explained as a tidally split mode caused by the equilibrium tides of the close binary system with a circular orbit. These pulsating features suggest that the primary of HZ Dra is a δ Scuti star, pulsating in both p- and g-mode and influenced by tidal forces.

Triple stellar systems allow us to study stellar processes that cannot be attained in binary stars. The evolutionary phases in which the stellar members undergo mass exchanges can alter the hierarchical layout of these systems. Yet, the lack of a self-consistent treatment of common-envelope (CE) in triple-star systems hinders the comprehensive understanding of their long-term fate. This paper examines the conditions predicted around binaries embedded within CEs using local 3D hydrodynamical simulations. We explore varying the initial binary separation, the flow Mach number, and the background stellar density gradients as informed by a wide array of CE conditions, including those invoked to explain the formation of the triple system hosting PSR J0337+1715. We find that the stellar density gradient governs the gaseous drag force, which determines the final configuration of the embedded binary. We observe a comparable net drag force on the center of mass but an overall reduction in the accretion rate of the binary compared to the single-object case. We find that, for most CE conditions, and in contrast to the uniform background density case, the binary orbital separation increases with time, softening the binary and preventing it from subsequently merging. We conclude that binaries spiraling within CEs become more vulnerable to disruption by tidal interactions. This can have profound implications on the final outcomes of triple-star systems.

<div> 关键词: Gyrochronology, 白矮星+主序星双星系统, 自转周期, 完全对流边界, 结构变化

总结:
Gyrochronology是用于确定低质量恒星年龄的有价值的工具，该研究基于针对宽广的白矮星+主序星双星系统的185个样本，并通过对MS星的旋转周期进行预测来验证了这一技术。研究表明，在完全对流边界附近，主序星的自转周期会出现高达三倍的增加，这是由于构造变化和该边界处发生的3He不稳定性所导致的。此外，由于当前的温度误差，无法将测得的自转周期唯一地与单个旋转轨道相对应，因此推测Gyrochronology可能对于非常接近完全对流边界的M型矮星并不可行。<br /><br /> <div>
Gyrochronology, a valuable tool for determining ages of low-mass stars where other techniques fail, relies on accurate calibration. We present a sample of 185 wide (>100 au) white dwarf + main sequence (WD + MS) binaries. Total ages of WDs are computed using all-sky survey photometry, Gaia parallaxes, and WD atmosphere models. Using a magnetic braking law calibrated against open clusters, along with assumptions about initial conditions and angular momentum transport, we construct gyrochrones to predict the rotation periods of MS stars. Both data and models show that, at the fully convective boundary (FCB), MS stars with WD ages of up to 7.5 Gyr and within a <50 K effective temperature range experience up to a threefold increase in rotation period relative to stars slightly cooler than the FCB. We suggest that rapid braking at this boundary is driven by a sharp rise in the convective overturn timescale (τcz) caused by structural changes between partially and fully convective stars and the 3He instability occurring at this boundary. While the specific location in mass (or temperature) of this feature varies with model physics, we argue that its existence remains consistent. Stars along this feature exhibit rotation periods that can be mapped, within 1σ, to a range of gyrochrones spanning ≈6 Gyr. Due to current temperature errors (≃50 K), this implies that a measured rotation period cannot be uniquely associated to a single gyrochrone, implying that gyrochronology may not be feasible for M dwarfs very close to the FCB.

Recent high-cadence transient surveys have discovered rapid transients whose light-curve timescales are shorter than those of typical supernovae (SNe). In this paper, we present a systematic search for rapid transients at medium-high redshifts among 3381 SNe candidates obtained from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program transient survey. We developed a machine learning classifier to classify the SN candidates into four types (Type Ia, Ibc, II SNe and rapid transients) based on the features derived from the light curves. By applying this classifier to the 3381 SN candidates and by further applying the quality cut, we selected 14 rapid transient samples. They are located at a wide range of redshifts (0.34 ≤ z ≤ 1.85) and show a wide range of the peak absolute magnitude (−17 ≥ M ≥ −22). The event rate of the rapid transients is estimated to be ∼6 × 103 events yr−1 Gpc−3 at z ∼ 0.74, which corresponds to about 2% of the event rate of normal core-collapse SNe at a similar redshift. Based on the luminosity and color evolution, we selected two candidates of Type Ibn SNe at z ∼ 0.75. The event rate of Type Ibn SN candidates is more than 1% of Type Ib SN rate at the same redshift, suggesting that this fraction of massive stars at this redshift range eruptively ejects their He-rich envelope just before the explosions. Also, two objects at z = 1.37 and 1.85 show high luminosities comparable to superluminous SNe. Their event rate is about 10%–25% of superluminous SNe at z ∼ 2.

<div> 关键词: classical novae, observational constraints, optical peak, high-cadence observations, white dwarf<br />
<br />总结: 
本文报道了对快速新星V1674 Her的前所未有的观测，这些观测从其光学峰值以上10等开始，并包括高频率（2分钟）的观测，记录了在短短5小时内约8等的增长。我们识别出光变曲线中的两个明显断裂点，指出了从缓慢上升到迅速上升，然后再到更快、几乎线性上升的转变。观测深度使我们能够在白矮星以Eddington光度发射的黑体辐射的假设下紧密约束光球的大小。我们发现，在快速风爆发之前，白矮星不太可能已经溢出罗奇波，这对解释费米伽马射线的探测结果构成了挑战，因为这可能是快速风与伴星卸去的气体形成的慢环之间的相互作用。 Evryscope和计划中的Argus Array对新星进行高频率观测，可以记录新星光变曲线的多样性，并有助于解决热核聚变、双星相互作用和激震如何驱动它们最早的亮度。 <div>
Observational constraints on classical novae are heavily biased to phases near optical peak and later because of the simple fact that novae are not typically discovered until they become bright. The earliest phases of brightening, coming before discovery, are typically missed, but this is changing with the proliferation of wide-field optical monitoring systems including the Zwicky Transient Facility, All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, and Evryscope. Here, we report on unprecedented observations of the fast nova V1674 Her beginning >10 mag below its optical peak and including high-cadence (2 minutes) observations that chart a rise of ∼8 mag in just 5 hr. Two clear breaks are identified as the light curve transitions first from rising slowly to rising rapidly, followed by a transition to an even faster, nearly linear rate of increasing flux with time. The depths of the observations allow us to place tight constraints on the size of the photosphere under the assumption of blackbody emission from a white dwarf emitting at its Eddington luminosity. We find that the white dwarf was unlikely to have overflowed its Roche lobe prior to the launch of a fast wind, which poses a challenge for explaining the Fermi γ-ray detections as the interaction of a fast wind with a slow torus of gas stripped from the inflated white dwarf envelope by the companion. High-cadence observations of novae from Evryscope and the planned Argus Array can record the diversity of rising nova light curves and help resolve how the interplay between thermonuclear fusion, binary interaction, and shocks power their earliest light.

<div> 关键词: Omega Centauri, SGB stars, age estimates, age-metallicity relation, Hubble Space Telescope photometry<br />
总结: 通过对Omega Centauri中8100多颗次巨星分支星的年龄估计，研究其恒星形成历史。使用多波段的哈勃空间望远镜光度和MUSE金属丰度的大数据集，将每颗星的光度和金属丰度与具有ω Cen特定[C + N + O]–[Fe/H]关系的理论等时线进行拟合，得出大部分星的年龄在13至10亿年之间，平均恒星年龄为12.08亿年，年龄的中位数不确定性为0.68亿年。构建了迄今为止最完整的ω Cen的年龄–金属丰度关系，并发现恒星的平均年龄随金属丰度增加而降低，并在年龄–金属丰度平面上发现了两条不同的流，暗示不同的恒星形成途径。对整个星团的年龄固有分散为0.75亿年，年龄分散随金属丰度的增加而明显增加。通过改变等时线参数和约束系统偏差，验证了年龄估计的可靠性，发现C + N + O关系对约束年龄–金属丰度关系最为关键。此外，还提出了具有年龄信息的SGB染色体图。未来，可以将这些恒星年龄与化学丰度相结合，研究亚群体的年龄差异，并揭示这个庞大核星团的化学演化历史。 <div>
We present age estimates for over 8100 subgiant branch (SGB) stars in Omega Centauri (ω Cen) to study its star formation history. Our large data set, which combines multi-wavelength Hubble Space Telescope photometry with MUSE metallicities, provides an unprecedented opportunity to measure individual stellar ages. We do this by fitting each star’s photometry and metallicity with theoretical isochrones that are embedded with an empirical [C + N + O]–[Fe/H] relation specific to ω Cen. The bulk of the stars have ages between 13 and 10 Gyr, with the mean stellar age being 12.08 ± 0.01 Gyr and the median age uncertainty being 0.68 Gyr. From these ages we construct the most complete age–metallicity relation for ω Cen to date. We find that the mean age of stars decreases with increasing metallicity and find two distinct streams in the age–metallicity plane, hinting at different star formation pathways. We derive an intrinsic spread in the ages of 0.75 ± 0.01 Gyr for the whole cluster, with the age spread showing a clear increase with metallicity. We verify the robustness of our age estimations by varying isochrone parameters and constraining our systematics. We find the C + N + O relation to be the most critical consideration for constraining the age–metallicity relation. We also present an SGB chromosome map with age information. In the future these stellar ages could be combined with chemical abundances to study age differences in subpopulations and uncover the chemical evolution history of this massive nuclear star cluster.

<br /><br />太阳系中的短寿命放射性同位素在早期提供了行星体加热和干燥的能量。然而，太阳系相对于其他类似形成特征的行星系是否高度富集仍不清楚。目前观测中也很难确定个别原行星盘中的短寿命放射性同位素富集程度。研究利用N体模拟估算了星际区域中短寿命放射性同位素的富集情况，发现对于26Al富集，太阳系处于期望分布的上限，并且对于更依赖超新星的同位素60Fe，太阳系富集程度相对较高。这些结果表明26Al驱动的干燥过程在外行星的组成中的作用可能被低估了，而60Fe作为加热源的影响也被过度估计。 
<br />总结:太阳系相对于其他类似行星系是否高度富集仍不清楚。研究利用N体模拟估算了星际区域中短寿命放射性同位素的富集情况，发现对于26Al富集，太阳系处于期望分布的上限，并且对于更依赖超新星的同位素60Fe，太阳系富集程度相对较高。 这些结果表明短寿命同位素在外行星的组成中的作用可能被低估了，而60Fe作为加热源的影响也被过度估计。 <div>
Recent research provides compelling evidence that the decay of short-lived radioisotopes (SLRs), such as 26Al, provided the bulk of energy for heating and desiccation of volatile-rich planetesimals in the early solar system. However, it remains unclear whether the early solar system was highly enriched relative to other planetary systems with similar formation characteristics. While the solar system possesses an elevated level of SLR enrichment compared to the interstellar medium, determining SLR enrichment of individual protoplanetary disks observationally has not been performed and is markedly more difficult. We use N-body simulations to estimate enrichment of SLRs in star-forming regions through two likely important SLR sources: stellar winds from massive stars and supernovae (SNae). We vary the number of stars and the radii of the star-forming regions and implement two models of stellar-wind SLR propagation for the radioisotopes 26Al and 60Fe. We find that for 26Al enrichment the solar system is at the upper end of the expected distribution, while for the more SNae-dependent isotope 60Fe we find that the solar system is comparatively very highly enriched. Furthermore, combined with our previous research, these results suggest that the statistical role of 26Al-driven desiccation on exoplanet bulk composition may be underestimated in typical interpretations of the low-mass exoplanet census, and that 60Fe is even less influential as a source of heating than previously assumed.

总结：<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了利用色-星等图(CMDs)对星系的星族形成史进行精确测量的方法，探讨了在大数据时代利用机器学习网络的可行性。研究利用最新的理论恒星演化模型细化CMDs方法，引入卷积神经网络提高效率，并创新初始恒星质量估计方法。经过测试和验证，深度学习网络SFHNet能够准确测量星系的星族形成史，并提供了关于恒星密度分布、初始恒星质量和星族形成速率的详细洞察。深度学习网络的应用不仅提高了方法的效率和灵活性，还为对附近星系的全面和深入理解提供了帮助。 <div>
Reproducing color–magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of star-resolved galaxies is one of the most precise methods for measuring the star formation history (SFH) of nearby galaxies back to the earliest time. The upcoming big data era poses challenges to the traditional numerical technique in its capacity to deal with vast amounts of data, which motivates us to explore the feasibility of employing machine learning networks in this field. In this study, we refine the synthetic CMD method with a state-of-the-art theoretical stellar evolution model to simulate the properties of stellar populations, incorporate the convolutional neural network in the fitting process to enhance the efficiency, and innovate the initial stellar mass estimation to improve the flexibility. The fine-tuned deep learning network, named SFHNet, has been tested with synthetic data and further validated with photometric data collected from the Hubble Space Telescope. The derived SFHs are largely in accordance with those reported in the literature. Furthermore, the network provides detailed insights into the distribution of stellar density, initial stellar mass, and star formation rate over the age–metallicity map. The application of the deep learning network not only measures the SFH accurately but also enhances the synthetic CMD method’s efficiency and flexibility, thereby facilitating a more comprehensive and in-depth understanding of nearby galaxies.

<div> 超亮X射线脉冲星; 超Eddington吸积; 广义相对论辐射磁流体力学模拟; 磁化中子星; 磁场结构

总结:
超亮X射线脉冲星（ULXP）是由超Eddington吸积在磁化中子星上引起的，其详细的磁场结构和吸流-出流过程还不太清楚。作者使用广义相对论辐射磁流体力学（GR-RMHD）模拟了超Eddington吸积流在磁化中子星上的行为。他们发现在磁屏蔽半径以外形成一个吸积盘和光学厚的出流，而在磁屏蔽半径以内则出现了与磁场线对齐的吸流。磁屏蔽半径处，当偶极磁场比四极磁场突出时，形成了靠近磁极的吸积柱，而四极磁场强度超过偶极磁场则形成了类似于贴近赤道的吸积带。磁化中子星的自转是通过吸积气体的角动量转换为电磁场的角动量而实现的。即使在一个磁极附近形成了吸积柱，观测到的亮度在有吸积柱和没有吸积柱的一侧几乎相同，这是因为辐射能量通过散射向两侧传输。根据作者的模型，银河系的ULXP Swift J0243.6+6124具有2×10^13 G的四极磁场和不到4×10^12 G的偶极磁场。 <div>
Although ultraluminous X-ray pulsars (ULXPs) are believed to be powered by super-Eddington accretion onto a magnetized neutron star (NS), the detailed structures of the inflow–outflow and magnetic fields are still not well understood. We perform general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics (GR-RMHD) simulations of super-Eddington accretion flows onto a magnetized NS with dipole and/or quadrupole magnetic fields. Our results show that an accretion disk and optically thick outflows form outside the magnetospheric radius, while inflows aligned with magnetic field lines appear inside. When the dipole field is more prominent than the quadrupole field at the magnetospheric radius, accretion columns form near the magnetic poles, whereas a quadrupole magnetic field stronger than the dipole field results in the formation of a belt-like accretion flow near the equatorial plane. The NS spins up as the angular momentum of the accreting gas is converted into the angular momentum of the electromagnetic field, which then flows into the NS. Even if an accretion column forms near one of the magnetic poles, the observed luminosity is almost the same on both the side with the accretion column and the side without it, because the radiation energy is transported to both sides through scattering. Our model suggests that galactic ULXP Swift J0243.6+6124 has a quadrupole magnetic field of 2 × 1013 G and a dipole magnetic field of less than 4 × 1012 G.

<br />
这项研究针对低频引力波探测器的主要目标之一——恒星质量黑洞的极端质量比螺旋（EMRIs）进行了研究。研究发现，当黑洞在中心渐进的轨道受到引力波辐射的影响时，强烈的质量分离可能导致螺旋形成率大幅下降，甚至降低一个数量级。这项研究揭示了在星系核内形成EMRI所需的强碰撞的重要性。 
<br /><br />总结: 
EMRIs和BHs是低频引力波探测器的主要目标。强质量分离可能会导致EMRI形成率下降。研究发现强碰撞对EMRI的形成非常重要。 <div>
Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) are among the main targets for upcoming low-frequency gravitational wave (GW) detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. In the classical scenario, EMRIs are formed when BHs scatter off each other and are driven onto highly eccentric orbits that gradually inspiral due to GW emission. If the cluster is in a state of strong mass segregation, the BHs are expected to reside in a steep cusp around the central massive black hole (MBH), which would facilitate more efficient EMRI formation. However, strong mass segregation may also lead to an increased rate of ejections due to close encounters between the BHs. Here, we test the relevance of such ejections for EMRI formation by numerically solving a two-dimensional Fokker–Planck equation. Our formalism includes the effects of two-body relaxation, GW dissipation, and ejections. We find that the EMRI formation rate can be suppressed due to ejections by more than an order of magnitude for strongly segregated BH cusps with density index γ ≳ 2.25 around central MBHs of mass M• ≲ 106 M⊙. The EMRI formation rate levels off up to a maximum value of ≃200 Gyr−1 due to ejections, which is roughly an order of magnitude lower than the usual scenarios ignoring ejections for steep BH cusps around low-mass MBHs. Our analysis reveals the significance of strong scatterings for EMRI formation in galactic nuclei.

总结: 
本文研究了磁活跃的巨星HD 251108，发现其具有稳定的21.3天旋转周期以及持续的长期光变化，这可通过恒稳的恒星斑点来解释。研究还跟踪了一次超耀斑的衰减阶段，观测到了未曾有的日冕温度成分细节。超耀斑的峰值通量约为10^34 erg s−1 (0.5–4.0 keV)，在早期衰减阶段呈指数级下降，是迄今观测到的最强烈的一次。超耀斑的发射过程与较小耀斑样本中已建立的趋势一致，证明了超耀斑发射的物理过程在较大范围的能量内保持一致。研究估计了耀斑环的长度约为恒星半径的2-4倍，并未观测到耀斑期间的丰度变化。<br /><br /> <div>
Many giant stars are magnetically active, which causes rotational variability, chromospheric emission lines, and X-ray emission. Large outbursts in these emission features can set limits on the magnetic field strength and thus constrain the mechanism of the underlying dynamo. HD 251108 is a Li-rich active K-type giant. We find a rotational period of 21.3 days with color changes and additional long-term photometric variability. Both can be explained with very stable stellar spots. We followed the decay phase of a superflare for 28 days with NICER and from the ground. We track the flare decay in unprecedented detail in several coronal temperature components. With a peak flux around 1034 erg s−1 (0.5–4.0 keV) and an exponential decay time of 2.2 days in the early decay phase, this is one of the strongest flares ever observed, yet it follows trends established from samples of smaller flares, for example, for the relations between Hα and X-ray flux, indicating that the physical process that powers the flare emission is consistent over a large range of flare energies. We estimate a flare loop length about 2–4 times the stellar radius. No evidence is seen for abundance changes during the flare.

Electron degradation serves as a significant energy source in planetary upper atmospheres. In this study, a Monte Carlo model is constructed to investigate the degradation of electrons in a pure O2 atmosphere under the local approximation. Both elastic and inelastic collision processes between electrons and O2 molecules are considered in the model. The yield spectra, characterizing the occurrence of various inelastic collisions for a specified pair of incident and post-collision energies, are obtained from the model. When combined with the information of e-O2 collision cross sections, the yields of each inelastic process are then determined. Furthermore, we derive the mean energy per ion pair and the efficiencies of various inelastic processes, along with the yields of secondary (and higher-order) electrons. The calculations presented here are beneficial for understanding the ionization and heating budgets in planetary atmospheres containing a significant amount of O2 such as Earth and Jovian icy satellites (Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto).

总结:<br />
这篇论文对2023年3月7日的太阳火山口喷发进行了多波段和多视角观测，采用修订的锥体模型首次对火山口进行了约4小时的三维重建和跟踪。结果显示火山口的传播不是径向的，在活跃区NOAA 13243的大尺度日冕环路周围进行了偏转运动。火山口的真实速度估计约为829 km/s，比CME核心（火山口）的速度快1.2倍。研究得出提取的修订锥体模型可以重现爆发性火山口早期生命中的加速和偏转。 <div>
In this paper, we carry out multiwavelength and multiview observations of the prominence eruption, which generated a C2.3 class flare and a coronal mass ejection (CME) on 2023 March 7. For the first time, we apply the revised cone model to three-dimensional reconstruction and tracking of the eruptive prominence for ∼4 hr. The prominence propagates nonradially and makes a detour around the large-scale coronal loops in active region NOAA 13243. The northward deflection angle increases from ∼36° to ∼47° before returning to ∼36° and keeping up. There is no longitudinal deflection throughout the propagation. The angular width of the cone increases from ∼30° and reaches a plateau at ∼37°. The heliocentric distance of the prominence rises from ∼1.1 to ∼10.0 R☉, and the prominence experiences continuous acceleration (∼51 m s−2) over 2 hr, which is probably related to the magnetic reconnection during the C-class flare. The true speed of the CME front is estimated to be ∼829 km s−1, which is ∼1.2 times larger than that of the CME core (prominence). We conclude that both acceleration and deflection of eruptive prominences in their early lives could be reproduced with the revised cone model.

总结: <br />本文报告了对SNe Ibn型超新星SN 2022ablq的多波段观测结果，特别是X射线观测结果。研究发现该超新星在X射线波段比传统的SN Ibn型超新星更明亮，推测其质量流失率在爆炸前0.5-2年达到峰值，而稳态恒星风不太可能是主要的质量流失机制。此外，研究还搜索了爆发性事件的前体辐射，但未发现与其他SNe Ibn类似的显著信号。最后，数值模型表明15太阳质量的氦星在爆发性事件后约1.8年爆炸，与观测到的辐射光变曲线一致。因此，观测结果不支持Wolf–Rayet恒星通过恒星风失去富含He物质的假设，而更加支持包括与紧密双星伴侣发生Roche溢流或在核合成晚期阶段发生爆发性事件的低质量祖恒星模型。 <div>
Type Ibn supernovae (SNe Ibn) are rare stellar explosions powered primarily by interaction between the SN ejecta and H-poor, He-rich material lost by their progenitor stars. Multiwavelength observations, particularly in the X-rays, of SNe Ibn constrain their poorly understood progenitor channels and mass-loss mechanisms. Here we present Swift X-ray, ultraviolet, and ground-based optical observations of the Type Ibn SN 2022ablq, only the second SN Ibn with X-ray detections to date. While similar to the prototypical Type Ibn SN 2006jc in the optical, SN 2022ablq is roughly an order of magnitude more luminous in the X-rays, reaching unabsorbed luminosities LX ∼ 4 × 1040 erg s−1 between 0.2–10 keV. From these X-ray observations we infer time-varying mass-loss rates between 0.05 and 0.5 M⊙ yr−1 peaking 0.5–2 yr before explosion. This complex mass-loss history and circumstellar environment disfavor steady-state winds as the primary progenitor mass-loss mechanism. We also search for precursor emission from alternative mass-loss mechanisms, such as eruptive outbursts, in forced photometry during the 2 yr before explosion. We find no statistically significant detections brighter than M ≈ −14—too shallow to rule out precursor events similar to those observed for other SNe Ibn. Finally, numerical models of the explosion of an ∼15 M⊙ helium star that undergoes an eruptive outburst ≈1.8 yr before explosion are consistent with the observed bolometric light curve. We conclude that our observations disfavor a Wolf–Rayet star progenitor losing He-rich material via stellar winds and instead favor lower-mass progenitor models, including Roche-lobe overflow in helium stars with compact binary companions or stars that undergo eruptive outbursts during late-stage nucleosynthesis stages.

Pulsating stars are universally recognized as precise distance indicators and tracers of stellar populations. Their variability, combined with well-defined relationships between pulsation properties and intrinsic evolutionary parameters such as luminosity, mass, and age, makes them essential for understanding galactic evolution and retrieving star formation histories. Therefore, accurate modeling of pulsating stars is crucial for using them as standard candles and stellar population tracers. This is the first paper in the “Stellar Pulsation and Evolution: a Combined Theoretical Renewal and Updated Models” project, which aims to present an update of Stellingwerf’s hydrodynamical pulsation code, by adopting the latest radiative opacity tables commonly used in stellar evolution community. We assess the impact of this update on pulsation properties, such as periods, instability strip topology, and light-curve shapes, as well as on period–Wesenheit and period–luminosity relations for Classical Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars, comparing the results with those derived using older opacity data. Our results indicate that the opacity update introduces only minor changes: instability strip boundary locations shift by no more than 100 K in effective temperature, and pulsation periods vary within 1σ compared to previous evaluations. Light curves exhibit slight differences in shape and amplitude. Consequently, the theoretical calibration of the Cepheid- or RRL-based extragalactic distance scale remains largely unaffected by the opacity changes. However, achieving consistency in opacity tables between stellar evolution and pulsation codes is a significant step toward a homogeneous and self-consistent stellar evolution and pulsation framework.

<div> ALMA, protoplanetary disks, molecular line observations, cold molecular chemistry, CRI rate  
总结:
ALMA观测了三星T Tauri盘GG Tau A的冷分子化学，发现N2H+和DCO+的发射。通过模型比较和观测结果，发现冷分子化学对CRI率最敏感，但对星际紫外光通量和C/O比的影响较小。最佳模型需要一个较低的CRI率，但无法解释N2H+和DCO+的较低温度。 <div>
Resolved molecular line observations are essential for gaining insight into the physical and chemical structure of protoplanetary disks, particularly in cold, dense regions where planets form and acquire their chemical compositions. However, tracing these regions is challenging because most molecules freeze onto grain surfaces and are not observable in the gas phase. We investigated cold molecular chemistry in the triple stellar T Tauri disk GG Tau A, which harbours a massive gas and dust ring and an outer disk, using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 7 observations. We present high angular resolution maps of N2H+ and DCO+ emission, with upper limits reported for H2D+, 13CS, and SO2. The radial intensity profile of N2H+ shows most emission near the ring’s outer edge, while DCO+ exhibits a double peak, one near the ring’s inner edge and the other in the outer disk. With complementary observations of lower-lying transitions, we constrained the molecular surface densities and rotation temperatures. We compared the derived quantities with model predictions across different cosmic-ray ionization (CRI) rates, carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios, and stellar UV fluxes. Cold molecular chemistry, affecting the N2H+, DCO+, and H2D+ abundances, is most sensitive to the CRI rate, while the stellar UV fluxes and C/O ratios have minimal impact on these three ions. Our best model requires a low CRI rate of 10−18 s−1. However, it fails to match the low temperatures derived from N2H+ and DCO+, 12–16 K, which are much lower than the CO freezing temperature.

<br />
这篇论文使用Swift卫星的Burst Alert Telescope探测到的140个活动星系核（AGN）的Spitzer光谱数据进行分析。研究发现，高离子化的中红外辐射线（MIR）如[Ne v] 14.32, 24.32 μm 和 [O iv] 25.89 μm可以作为AGN活动的良好指标，并且不受遮挡影响。在AGN样本中，MIR冠状发射线的检测率很高（≳85%–90%），其亮度与14–150 keV光度呈强相关性，且与全天星等亮度也紧密相关。研究还发现MIR冠状发射线的强度与14–150 keV光度的关系与黑洞质量、AGN光度和Eddington比无关，且不受高X射线列密度影响，证实MIR冠状发射线可作为1042–1045 erg s−1范围内X射线光度的无偏跟踪器。<br /><br />总结: <br />AGN样本的Spitzer光谱数据显示，MIR冠状发射线可以作为AGN活动的可靠指标，且与X射线光度和全天星等亮度呈现出强相关性。此外，MIR冠状发射线的强度与X射线光度的关系不受其他因素的影响，因此可作为无偏跟踪器。 <div>
We analyze Spitzer spectra of 140 active galactic nuclei (AGN) detected in the hard X-rays (14–195 keV) by the Burst Alert Telescope on board Swift. This sample allows us to probe several orders of magnitude in black hole masses (106–109M⊙), Eddington ratios (10−3–1), X-ray luminosities (1042–1045 erg s−1), and X-ray column densities (1020–1024 cm−2). The AGN emission is expected to be the dominant source of ionizing photons with energies ≳50 eV, and therefore, high-ionization mid-infrared (MIR) emission lines such as [Ne v] 14.32, 24.32 μm and [O iv] 25.89 μm are predicted to be good proxies of AGN activity, and robust against obscuration effects. We find high detection rates (≳85%–90%) for the MIR coronal emission lines in our AGN sample. The luminosities of these lines are correlated with the 14–150 keV luminosity (with a typical scatter of σ ∼0.4–0.5 dex), strongly indicating that the MIR coronal line (CL) emission is driven by AGN activity. CLs are also tightly correlated to the bolometric luminosity (σ ∼0.2–0.3 dex), calculated from careful analysis of the spectral energy distribution. We find that the relationship between the CL strengths and L14–150 keV is independent of black hole mass, AGN luminosity, and Eddington ratio, and mostly not affected by high X-ray column densities. This confirms that the MIR CLs can be used as unbiased tracers of the AGN power for X-ray luminosities in the 1042–1045 erg s−1 range.

<div> Eri III, DELVE 1, spectroscopy, dwarf galaxies, chemical abundances
总结: 该研究对Eri III和DELVE 1进行了光谱学研究，确定了它们的成员星，并对其速度和金属丰度进行了限制。作者发现这两个天体的最亮恒星都具有极低的金属丰度，并且富含碳元素。由于它们的金属丰度远低于银河系球状星团的金属丰度，并且未曾在球状星团中发现这种类型的恒星，这可能表明Eri III和DELVE 1是矮星系。然而，它们的半光半径相较于已知的超微弱矮星系更为紧凑。研究者得出结论，Eri III和DELVE 1可能是迄今发现的最小的矮星系，或者它们代表了一类经历了与普通球状星团不同化学演化的新型恒星团。未来对更多恒星的碳和/或铁元素丰度以及两个系统的改善恒星运动学的测量结果将有助于进一步确定它们的性质。 <div>
We present spectroscopy of the ultra-faint Milky Way satellites Eridanus III (Eri III) and DELVE 1. We identify eight member stars in each satellite and place nonconstraining upper limits on their velocity and metallicity dispersions. The brightest star in each object is very metal poor, at [Fe/H] = −3.1 for Eri III and [Fe/H] = −2.8 for DELVE 1. Both of these stars exhibit large overabundances of carbon and very low abundances of the neutron-capture elements Ba and Sr, and we classify them as CEMP-no stars. Because their metallicities are well below those of the Milky Way globular cluster population, and because no CEMP-no stars have been identified in globular clusters, these chemical abundances could suggest that Eri III and DELVE 1 are dwarf galaxies. On the other hand, the two systems have half-light radii of 8 pc and 6 pc, respectively, which are more compact than any known ultra-faint dwarfs. We conclude that Eri III and DELVE 1 are either the smallest dwarf galaxies yet discovered, or they are representatives of a new class of star clusters that underwent chemical evolution distinct from that of ordinary globular clusters. In the latter scenario, such objects are likely the most primordial star clusters surviving today. These possibilities can be distinguished by future measurements of carbon and/or iron abundances for larger samples of stars or improved stellar kinematics for the two systems.

EK Draconis, a nearby young solar-type star (G1.5V, 50–120 Myr), is known as one of the best proxies for inferring the environmental conditions of the young Sun. The star frequently produces superflares, and Paper I presented the first evidence of an associated gigantic prominence eruption observed as a blueshifted Hα Balmer line emission. In this paper, we present the results of the dynamical modeling of the stellar eruption and examine its relationship to the surface starspots and large-scale magnetic fields observed concurrently with the event. By performing a 1D freefall dynamical model and a 1D hydrodynamic simulation of the flow along the expanding magnetic loop, we found that the prominence eruption likely occurred near the stellar limb (12 -16 degrees from the limb) and was ejected at an angle of -24 degrees relative to the line of sight, and the magnetic structures can expand into a coronal mass ejection. The observed prominence displayed a terminal velocity of ∼0 km s−1 prior to disappearance, complicating the interpretation of its dynamics in Paper I. The models in this paper suggest that prominence’s Hα intensity diminishes at around or before its expected maximum height, explaining the puzzling time evolution in observations. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite light curve modeling and (Zeeman) Doppler Imaging revealed large midlatitude spots with polarity inversion lines and one polar spot with dominant single polarity, all near the stellar limb during the eruption. This suggests that midlatitude spots could be the source of the gigantic prominence we reported in Paper I. These results provide valuable insights into the dynamic processes that likely influenced the environments of early Earth, Mars, Venus, and young exoplanets.

<title>Applying the Velocity Gradient Technique in NGC 1333: Comparison with Dust Polarization Observations</title>

总结: 本文使用了VGT技术研究星形成区域的磁场，并与不同波长的尘埃偏振观测结果进行比较。研究表明VGT在不同密度区域的适用性，通过分析分子线梯度推导出倾斜角和三维阿尔文马赫数。然而，研究结果显示出速度梯度推断的方向与尘埃推断的磁场方向并无密切关联。 <div>
Magnetic fields (B-fields) are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium (ISM), and they play an essential role in the formation of molecular clouds and subsequent star formation. However, B-fields in interstellar environments remain challenging to measure, and their properties typically need to be inferred from dust polarization observations over multiple physical scales. In this work, we seek to use a recently proposed approach called the velocity gradient technique (VGT) to study B-fields in star-forming regions and compare the results with dust polarization observations in different wavelengths. The VGT is based on the anisotropic properties of eddies in magnetized turbulence to derive B-field properties in the ISM. We investigate that this technique is synergistic with dust polarimetry when applied to a turbulent diffused medium for the purpose of measuring its magnetization. Specifically, we use the VGT on molecular line data toward the NGC 1333 star-forming region (12CO, 13CO, C18O, and N2H+), and we compare the derived B-field properties with those inferred from 214 and 850 μm dust polarization observations of the region using Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy/High-Resolution Airborne Wide-band Camera Plus and James Clerk Maxwell Telescope/POL-2, respectively. We estimate both the inclination angle and the 3D Alfvénic Mach number MA from the molecular line gradients. Crucially, testing this technique on gravitationally bound, dynamic, and turbulent regions, and comparing the results with those obtained from polarization observations at different wavelengths, such as the plane-of-sky field orientation, is an important test on the applicability of the VGT in various density regimes of the ISM. We in general do not find a close correlation between the velocity gradient inferred orientations and the dust inferred magnetic field orientations.

<title>A New Rarity Assessment of the “Disk of Satellites”: The Milky Way System Is the Exception Rather Than the Rule in the ΛCDM Cosmology</title>

<div> 关键词: Milky Way, satellite galaxies, disk-like distributions, lambda cold dark matter cosmology, c/a ratio<br />
总结:<br />
本研究对银河系周围卫星星系的分布模式进行了探讨，通过构建“卫星分布生成器”代码生成了105个类似系统，并发现银河系周围卫星星系的c/a概率分布函数十分宽泛，并提出了新的评估方法。重新评估了银河系周围卫星星系的稀有性，并发现其仍然是罕见的。最后指出银河系周围卫星的轨道极和距离要比模拟的宿主-卫星系统更符合一个平面友好的分布，挑战了目前的结构和星系形成模型。 <div>
The majority of satellite galaxies around the Milky Way (MW) show disk-like distributions (the disk of satellites; DoS), which is a small-scale problem of the lambda cold dark matter cosmology. The conventional definition of the MW-like DoS is a satellite system with a minor-to-major axis ratio (c/a) lower than the MW’s c/a value of 0.181. Here, we question the validity of the c/a-based DoS rarity assessment and propose an alternative approach. How satellites are placed around a galaxy is dictated mainly by two factors: the distributions of the satellites’ orbital poles and their distances from the host. Based on this premise, we construct the “satellite distribution generator” code and generate 105 spatially and kinematically analogous systems (SKASs) sharing these two factors. The SKAS can disclose the intrinsic, underlying c/a probability distribution function (PDF), from which a present-day c/a value is fortuitously determined. We find that the c/a PDF of the MW DoS defined by 11 classical satellites is quite broad (σc/a ∼ 0.105), implying that a simple present-day c/a value, combined with its highly time-variable nature, cannot fully represent the degree of flatness. Moreover, based on the intrinsic c/a PDF, we reevaluate the rarity of the MW DoS by comparing it with Illustris TNG50-1 host–satellite systems and find that even with the new measure, the MW DoS remains rare (0.00%–3.40%). We show that the reason behind the rareness is that both orbital poles and distances of the 11 MW satellites are far more plane-friendly than those of simulated host–satellite systems, challenging the current structure and galaxy formation model.

<title>Could the Recent Rebrightening of the GW170817A Afterglow Be Caused by a Counterjet?</title>

<br /><br />
总结: 
GRB 170817A是第一个通过引力波和电磁信号检测到的双中子星并合事件。研究重新评估了喷流参数，表明可能存在反喷流。但通过观测发现过剩流量与反喷流的关联性不足以证明这种假设。因此，需要结合多波段光变曲线和视觉运动来破解喷流的几何参数和微物理参数之间的不确定性。 <div>
GRB 170817A (also GW170817) became the first binary neutron star merger event detected via gravitational waves and electromagnetic signals. Over the next 4 yr, various multiband observations have led to reimaging of the various short gamma-ray burst and interstellar medium interaction models. While these models successfully explain the observed afterglow until ∼900 days, a rebrightening or excess flux was observed in the 1 keV X-ray band after ∼1000 days. In this study, we reevaluate the jet parameters using new observations (until ∼1234 days) with a boosted fireball jet model. We study the observable effects of the counterjet for GRB 170817A, using our new afterglow code, firefly. Our results show that it is indeed possible for the observed excess to coincide with the emissions from a counterjet (∼800 days). We also computed an empirical scaling law between the jet and counterjet peak emission timescales and the observer angle. The firefly code can also track the simulated object through the observer’s sky and numerically model the apparent motion. The calculated apparent motion (≈2.6c) does not match the observed apparent motion (5.2c−7.5c). Hence we conclude that the excess flux of GRB 170817A may not be associated with a counterjet; however, it is not enough to reject this hypothesis from the traditional counterjet visibility timescale, which predicts ≥5000 days. The apparent motion, combined with the multiband lightcurves, is needed to break the degeneracy between the geometrical parameters and the microphysical parameters of the afterglow.

We present a study of the abundance of calcium in the innermost disk of 70 T Tauri stars in the star-forming regions of Chamaeleon I, Lupus, and Orion OB1b. We use calcium as a proxy for the refractory material that reaches the inner disk. We used magnetospheric accretion models to analyze the Ca ii emission lines and estimate abundances in the accretion flows of the stars, which feed from the inner disks. We find Ca depletion in disks of all three star-forming regions, with 57% of the sample having [Ca/H] < –0.30 relative to the solar abundance. All disks with cavities and/or substructures show depletion, consistent with trapping of refractories in pressure bumps. Significant Ca depletion ([Ca/H] < –0.30) is also measured in 60% of full disks, although some of those disks may have hidden substructures or cavities. We find no correlation between Ca abundance and stellar or disk parameters except for the mass accretion rate onto the star. This could suggest that the inner and outer disks are decoupled, and that the mass accretion rate is related to a mass reservoir in the inner disk, while refractory depletion reflects phenomena in the outer disk related to the presence of structure and forming planets. Our results of refractory depletion and timescales for depletion are qualitatively consistent with expectations of dust growth and radial drift, including partitioning of elements, and constitute direct evidence that radial drift of solids locked in pebbles takes place in disks.

<div> 关键词: 硫化物，固体SO2，氢原子，冰幕，反应产物

总结:
实验和计算研究表明，固体SO2在低温下与氢原子反应，大约80%的固体SO2会在10-40 K时从基底蒸发，甚至在60 K时也会有大约50%蒸发。量子化学计算表明，氢原子更倾向于加到固体SO2的S原子上，形成HSO2自由基。进一步的反应会生成多种含硫物种，包括HS(O)OH，S(O)OH自由基，HO-S-OH，HS-OH和H2S。在H和SO2的共沉积实验中，确认了H2S，HS(O)OH和/或HO-S-OH的形成。然而，这些含硫物种的产量不足以解释初始SO2的完全消失，这表明一些产物会在形成后脱附到气相中。这项研究表明，冰幕中的一部分SO2可能保持未反应状态，避免氢化反应，而其余部分则转化为其他物种，其中一些可能会发生化学脱附。 <div>
Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a sulfur-containing molecule expected to exist as a solid in the interstellar medium. In this study, we have performed laboratory experiments and computational studies on the surface reactions of solid SO2 with hydrogen atoms on amorphous solid water (ASW) at low temperatures. After 40 minutes of exposure of SO2 deposited on ASW to H atoms, approximately 80% of the solid SO2 was lost from the substrate at 10–40 K, and approximately 50% even at 60 K, without any definite detection of reaction products. Quantum chemical calculations suggest that H atoms preferentially add to the S atom of solid SO2, forming the HSO2 radical. Further reactions of the HSO2 radical with H atoms result in the formation of several S-bearing species, including HS(O)OH, the S(O)OH radical, HO–S–OH, HS–OH, and H2S. In codeposition experiments involving H and SO2, we have confirmed the formation of H2S, HS(O)OH, and/or HO–S–OH. However, the yields of these S-bearing species are insufficient to account for the complete loss of the initial SO2 reactant. These findings suggest that some products are desorbed into the gas phase upon formation. This study indicates that a portion of the SO2 in ice mantles may remain unreacted, avoiding hydrogenation, while the remainder is converted into other species, some of which may be subject to chemical desorption.

本研究利用James Clerk Maxwell望远镜对红外暗云G16.96+0.27进行了850μm热尘极化观测，发现平均磁场方向与Planck 353 GHz数据的大尺度磁场方向大致垂直于细丝结构。通过Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi方法估计平面磁场强度约为96μG和60μG。对云团的维里参数和磁临界参数进行了计算，发现磁场和湍流均弱于重力，但磁场和湍流合力等于重力，表明G16.96+0.27处于准平衡状态。同时发现磁场与云团之间的对齐性在密集区域有逐渐从垂直向散列的趋势，可能是潜在碎片形成的迹象。 <div>
We present 850 μm thermal dust polarization observations with a resolution of 14.″4 (∼0.13 pc) toward an infrared dark cloud G16.96+0.27 using James Clerk Maxwell Telescope/POL-2. The average magnetic field orientation, which roughly agrees with the larger-scale magnetic field orientation traced by the Planck 353 GHz data, is approximately perpendicular to the filament structure. The estimated plane-of-sky magnetic field strength is ∼96 μG and ∼60 μG using two variants of the Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi methods. We calculate the virial and magnetic critical parameters to evaluate the relative importance of gravity, the magnetic field, and turbulence. The magnetic field and turbulence are both weaker than gravity, but magnetic fields and turbulence together are equal to gravity, suggesting that G16.96+0.27 is in a quasi-equilibrium state. The alignment between the magnetic field and cloud is found to have a trend moving away from perpendicularity in the dense regions, which may serve as a tracer of potential fragmentation in such quiescent filaments.

In this study, we investigate the impact of modified gravity (MG) on the merger rate of compact binaries within dark matter spikes surrounding supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Specifically, we calculate the binary merger rates involving primordial black holes (PBHs) and/or neutron stars (NSs) in Hu–Sawicki f(R) gravity and the normal branch of Dvali–Gabadadze–Porrati (nDGP) gravity, with three SMBH mass functions: Benson, Vika, and Shankar. The results show consistently higher merger rates predicted for PBH–PBH and PBH–NS binaries in these gravity models compared to general relativity (GR), in particular at lower SMBH masses and for steeper dark matter spike density profiles. The predicted merger rates are compared to the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA observations in constraining the parameters of the theory. In particular, we find steeper dark matter spike density profiles in the MG scenarios compared to GR. When compared to current observational constraints on PBH abundance, the mass ranges allowed by Hu–Sawicki f(R) models are found to be wider than those allowed by nDGP models, for given merger rates. The results are highly dependent on the choice of SMBH mass function, with the Vika and Shankar mass functions predicting lower abundances. The considerable sensitivity of the results to the assumed gravity scenario and SMBH mass function demonstrates the necessity of incorporating the corresponding theoretical uncertainties when making relatively robust predictions on compact binary merger rates and, as a result, on PBH properties.

<title>Dark Photon Dark Matter and Low-frequency Gravitational-wave Detection with Gaia-like Astrometry</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Astrometric surveys offer us a method for searching for elusive cosmic signatures, such as ultralight dark photon dark matter and gravitational waves (GWs), by observing the temporal change of stars’ apparent locations. The detection capabilities of such surveys rapidly decrease at low frequencies, because the signals become hardly distinguishable from the background motion of stars. In this work, we find that the background motion can be well described by a linear model over time, based on which we propose a linear background subtraction scheme. Compared to the conventional quadratic subtraction, the advantage of linear subtraction emerges within the frequency range below 6 × 10−9 Hz. Taking dark photons with purely gravitational interactions, dark photons with additional U(1)B or U(1)B−L gauge interactions, and low-frequency GWs as examples, we illustrate that the linear subtraction scheme can result in an enhancement of more than 1 order of magnitude in the exclusion limits of Gaia-like experiments in the low-frequency range.

<title>Probing the High-frequency Variability of NGC 5044: The Key to Active Galactic Nucleus Feedback</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The active galactic nucleus (AGN) feeding and feedback process in the centers of galaxy clusters and groups is still not well understood. NGC 5044 is the ideal system in which to study AGN feedback. It hosts the largest known reservoir of cold gas in any cool-core galaxy group, and features several past epochs of AGN feedback imprinted as cavities in the X-ray-bright intragroup medium, as well as parsec-scale jets. We present Submillimeter Array, Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array high-frequency observations of NGC 5044 to assess the time variability of the millimeter-wave band emission from the accretion disk, and quantify the spectral energy distribution (SED) from the radio to submillimeter band. The SED is well described by an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model and self-absorbed jet emission from an aging plasma with τ ∼ 1 kyr. We find a characteristic variability timescale of 150 days, which constrains the ADAF emission region to about 0.1 pc, and the magnetic field to ∼4.7 mG in the jets and 870 G in the accretion disk. Longer monitoring/sampling will allow to understand if the underlying process is truly periodic in nature.

<title>The IMF Clock Angle Effect on the Tail Cross Section of the Martian Magnetic Pileup Boundary and Bow Shock</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using a three-dimensional global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation model, we investigate the effects of different interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) clock angles on the tail configuration of the Martian magnetic pileup boundary (MPB) and bow shock (BS). The study reveals the following: (1) The cross sections of the tail MPB and BS are approximately elliptical. The MPB tail cross section generally elongates in the direction of the IMF clock angle, whereas the BS tail cross section is roughly elongated perpendicular to the IMF clock angle direction. (2) An IMF with a northward component can cause the tail cross section of the MPB to shift slightly to the south when the intense crustal magnetic fields are located on the dayside. (3) As the tail distance from Mars increases, the eccentricity of the cross section ellipses of both the MPB and BS tail increases, as well as the major and minor axes. Additionally, the major and minor axes of the tail MPB’s cross section ellipses begin to decrease at the far magnetotail, suggesting that the Martian MPB tail might be a closed structure on the nightside.

<title>Cosmological Prediction of the Void and Galaxy Clustering Measurements in the CSST Spectroscopic Survey</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The void power spectrum is related to the clustering of low-density regions in the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe and can be used as an effective cosmological probe to extract information on the LSS. We generate galaxy mock catalogs from a Jiutian simulation and identify voids using the watershed algorithm for studying the cosmological constraint strength of the China Space Station Telescope spectroscopic survey. The galaxy and void autopower spectra and void−galaxy cross-power spectra at z = 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 are derived from the mock catalogs. To fit the full power spectra, we propose to use the void average effective radius at a given redshift to simplify the theoretical model, and we adopt the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique to implement the constraints on the cosmological and void parameters. The systematic parameters, such as galaxy and void biases and noise terms in the power spectra, are also included in the fitting process. We find that our theoretical model can correctly extract the cosmological information from the galaxy and void power spectra, which demonstrates its feasibility and effectivity. The joint constraint accuracy of the cosmological parameters can be improved by ∼20% compared to that of the galaxy power spectrum only. The fitting results of the void density profile and systematic parameters are also well constrained and consistent with the expectation. This indicates that the void-clustering measurement can be an effective complement to the galaxy-clustering probe, especially for the next-generation galaxy surveys.

<title>Double-edged Sword: The Influence of Tidal Interaction on Stellar Activity in Binaries</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using the LAMOST DR7 low-resolution spectra, we carried out a systematic study of stellar chromospheric activity in both single and binary stars. We constructed a binary sample and a single-star sample, mainly using the binary belt and the main sequence in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, respectively. By comparing the S indices between single and binary stars within each color bin, we found for K-type stars, binaries exhibit enhanced activity compared to single stars, which could be attributed to the increase in spin rate caused by tidal synchronization or to the interactions of magnetic fields. Both single stars and binaries fall on a common sequence in the activity-period relation, indicating that the chromospheric activities of binaries are dominated by the more active components. More intriguingly, in some color ranges, a slight decline of the S index for smaller orbital periods was observed for binary stars. Although the possibility of sample selection effects cannot be excluded, this may mark the first example of supersaturation (i.e., caused by reduced active regions) being detected in chromospheric activity, or provide evidence of the suppressing effect on the magnetic dynamo and stellar activities by strong tidal interaction in very close binaries. Our study suggests that tidal interaction acts as a double-edged sword in relation to stellar activities.

Despite the significance of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in space weather, a comprehensive understanding of their interior morphology remains a scientific challenge, particularly with the advent of many state-of-the-art solar missions such as Parker Solar Probe (Parker) and Solar Orbiter (SO). In this study, we present an analysis of a complex CME as observed by the Wide-Field Imager for Solar PRobe (WISPR) heliospheric imager during Parker’s seventh solar encounter. The CME morphology does not fully conform with the general three-part density structure, exhibiting a front and core not significantly bright, with a highly structured overall configuration. In particular, its morphology reveals nonconcentric nested rings, which we argue are a signature of the embedded helical magnetic flux rope of the CME. For that, we analyze the morphological and kinematical properties of the nested density structures and demonstrate that they outline the projection of the three-dimensional structure of the flux rope as it crosses the lines of sight of the WISPR imager, thereby revealing the magnetic field geometry. Comparison of observations from various viewpoints suggests that the CME substructures can be discerned owing to the ideal viewing perspective, close proximity, and spatial resolution of the observing instrument.

<div> 关键词: 脉冲星、闪烁带宽、动态谱、电子密度模型、Arecibo望远镜

总结:<br /><br />这项工作使用了Arecibo望远镜的数据，尝试对脉冲星的动态谱进行分析，测量其闪烁带宽。研究发现，闪烁带宽的测量结果大多数情况下超过了NE2001和YMW16两个流行的银河模型的预测。此外，对闪烁带宽的高斯拟合结果与电子密度模型的预测更加一致。先前的文献数值测量结果存在较大差异，这可能与时间变化的星际介质参数有关。该研究拓展了AO327的范围，进一步探讨了这些趋势，突显了大型档案数据集在项目初始概念之外仍具有重要意义。 <div>
A pulsar’s scintillation bandwidth is inversely proportional to the scattering delay, making accurate measurements of scintillation bandwidth critical to characterize unmitigated delays in efforts to measure low-frequency gravitational waves with pulsar timing arrays. In this pilot work, we searched for a subset of known pulsars within ∼97% of the data taken with the Puerto Rico Ultimate Pulsar Processing Instrument for the AO327 survey with the Arecibo telescope, attempting to measure the scintillation bandwidths in the data set by fitting to the 2D autocorrelation function of their dynamic spectra. We successfully measured 38 bandwidths from 23 pulsars (six without prior literature values), finding that: almost all of the measurements are larger than the predictions from NE2001 and YMW16 (two popular galactic models); NE2001 is more consistent with our measurements than YMW16; Gaussian fits to the bandwidth are more consistent with both electron density models than Lorentzian ones; and for the 17 pulsars with prior literature values, the measurements between various sources often vary by a few factors. The success of Gaussian fits may be due to the use of Gaussian fits to train models in previous work. The variance of literature values over time could relate to the scaling factor used to compare measurements, but also seems consistent with time-varying interstellar medium parameters. This work can be extended to the rest of AO327 to further investigate these trends, highlighting the continuing importance of large archival data sets for projects beyond their initial conception.

总结:<br /><br />本研究探讨了太阳等离子体的热非平衡状态，发现在适当的局部和全局加热率组合下，即使在具有可观的质量和能量通量的跨声速太阳风中，等离子体也可能呈现热非平衡状态。这表明在太阳风的稳态条件下，等离子体能够承受的足点加热量存在限制，并可能有助于解释从太阳表面高度浓缩磁通量区域发出的太阳风流的变化。这一发现对于高密度太阳风的各种来源具有重要意义，包括形成在极区日冕空洞的混合磁极性区域上方的羽流以及从日冕空洞边界发出的慢速太阳风。 <div>
Thermal nonequilibrium (TNE) is a condition of the plasma in the solar corona in which the local rate of energy loss due to radiation increases to the point that it cannot be sustained by the various heating terms acting on the plasma, precluding the existence of a steady state. The limit cycles of precipitation and evaporation that result from TNE have been simulated in 1D models of coronal loops, as well as 2D and 3D models of the solar chromosphere and lower corona. However, a careful study of TNE in the solar wind has not been performed until now. Here, we demonstrate that for suitable combinations of local and global heating rates, it is possible for the plasma to exhibit a TNE condition, even in the context of a transonic solar wind with appreciable mass and energy fluxes. This implies limits on the amount of footpoint heating that can be withstood under steady-state conditions in the solar wind, and may help to explain the variability of solar wind streams that emanate from regions of highly concentrated magnetic flux on the solar surface. The implications of this finding pertain to various sources of high-density solar wind, including plumes that form above regions of mixed magnetic polarity in polar coronal holes and the slow solar wind that emanates from coronal hole boundaries.

Astrophysical emission lines arising from particle decays can offer unique insights into the nature of dark matter (DM). Using dedicated simulations with background and foreground modeling, we comprehensively demonstrate that the recently launched X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) space telescope with powerful X-ray spectroscopy capabilities is particularly well suited to probe decaying DM, such as sterile neutrinos and axion-like particles, in the mass range of a few to tens of keV. We analyze and map XRISM’s DM discovery potential parameter space by considering the Milky Way Galactic DM halo, including establishing an optimal line-of-sight search, as well as dwarf galaxies, where we identify Segue 1 as a remarkably promising target. We demonstrate that with only 100 ks exposure, the XRISM/Resolve instrument is capable of probing the underexplored DM parameter window around a few keV and testing DM couplings with a sensitivity that exceeds by two orders existing Segue 1 limits. Further, we demonstrate that XRISM/Xtend instrument sensitivity enables discovery of the nature of faint astrophysical X-ray sources, especially in Segue 1, which could shed light on star formation history. We discuss implications for decaying DM searches with improved detector energy resolution in future experiments.

<div> 红移、宇宙黎明、光子、中性氢原子、温度耦合
总结:
红移为宇宙黎明时期形成的第一个星体发射的光子在Lyα和Lyman限频率之间。这些光子对中性氢原子的自旋温度和星际介质的动力学温度进行耦合，并通过与氢原子交换能量影响动力学温度。研究发现，星系群介质中所含的光子大约有10%-20%为注入光子。在这种情况下，系统在大约1百万年内达到热平衡，最终温度在50-100K之间。而连续光子的准静态平衡则需要约1亿年的时间，在z≃20时期相当于宇宙的年龄。此外，文章还简要讨论了Lyα诱导加热对宇宙黎明时期的21厘米信号的影响。 <div>
The first star-forming objects that formed at high redshifts during the cosmic dawn (CD) also emitted photons between Lyα and Lyman-limit frequencies. These photons are instrumental in coupling the spin temperature of the neutral hydrogen (H i) atoms with the kinetic temperature of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Along with this coupling effect, these photons also impact the kinetic temperature by exchanging energy with the H i atoms. The injected Lyα photons in general cool the medium, while the continuum photons heat the medium. While studying this effect in the literature, a quasi-static profile around the Lyα frequency is assumed. In this paper, we solve the time-dependent coupled dynamics of the photon intensity profile along with the evolution of the thermal state of the IGM and H i spin temperature. It is expected that, during the CD era, the IGM has a mix of continuum photons with 10%–20% of injected photons. For this case, we show that the system reaches thermal equilibrium in around 1 Myr, with the final temperature in the range 50–100 K. This timescale is comparable to the source lifetime of Population III stars at high redshifts. One impact of switching off short-lived sources is that it can keep the system heated above the temperature of the quasi-static state. We also show that the quasi-static equilibrium for the continuum photons is only achieved on timescales of 100 Myr at z ≃ 20, comparable to the age of the Universe. We also briefly discuss how the Lyα induced heating can impact the 21 cm signal from CD.

总结:
太阳风暴是一种强大的太阳现象，可以导致严重的空间天气事件。预测CME到达地球的时间非常重要。文章评估了一种名为SPM3的预测模型，发现其对高太阳活动年份的预测效果更好。研究还发现CME的角宽度越大，相应的IP冲击波到达地球的概率就越高。总体来说，SPM3对CME事件的预测效果良好，对太阳活动的影响及CME的起源经度也能提供有价值的信息。 <div>
Coronal mass ejection (CME) is a powerful solar phenomenon that can lead to severe space weather events. Forecasting whether and when the corresponding interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) will reach the Earth is very important in space weather study and forecast. At present, many different kinds of models use the near-Sun CME observations as model inputs to predict its propagation with similar prediction accuracies for large sample events. Among a series of physics-based models, the best-performing version of the shock propagation model (SPM) for large sample events, i.e., SPM3, had achieved a good forecast effect for the 23rd Solar Cycle events (1997.02–2006.12). To further evaluate SPM3, we collected CME events from 2013 January to 2023 July from the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) CME scoreboard as a new data set. SPM3 achieved a total prediction success rate of 57% for these new events with a mean absolute error of 8.93 hr and a rms error of 10.86 hr for the shock's arrival time. Interestingly, SPM3 provided better predictions for the CME/shock events during high solar activity years than low solar activity years. We also analyzed the influence of input parameters on CME propagation and found that the larger the angular width of the CME event, the higher the probability of the corresponding IP shock's reaching the Earth. Source latitude had little effect on the arrival probability of the corresponding shock, while source longitude did. The CMEs originating from around W15° had the largest probability of hitting the Earth.

<div> N-body 模型, 金属丰度梯度, 银河演化, 条形不稳定性, 垂直加热机制
<br /><br />总结:
本研究通过构建单盘和三盘N-body模型，发现了银河系中金属丰度梯度的形成机制。外部贫金属颗粒通过条形不稳定性向内运动，并在杆状结构形成后经历更显著的垂直加热，使其最终位于更大的垂直高度。这一“两步加热”机制线性地将前体盘中的径向金属丰度梯度转化为垂直金属丰度梯度。通过与具有径向独立高斯金属丰度的三盘模型的比较发现，尽管存在某些局限，但“两步加热”机制在塑造银河系垂直金属丰度梯度中仍然很重要。如果杆状和屈曲不稳定性对形成箱状/花生形天鹅座臂起到贡献，那么“两步加热”机制在箱状/花生形天鹅座臂的演化中不可避免。 <div>
A vertical metallicity gradient (VMG) in the Milky Way bulge is well-established. Yet, its origin has not been fully understood under the Galactic secular evolution scenario. We construct single-disk and triple-disk N-body models with an initial radial metallicity gradient (RMG) for each disk. These models generate a VMG through a “two-step heating” mechanism: the outer, metal-poor particles move inward via the bar instability and subsequently undergo more significant vertical heating during the buckling instability, so they end up at greater vertical height. The “two-step heating” mechanism nearly linearly transforms the RMGs in precursor disks into VMGs. Comparing the models with a triple-disk model tagged with radially independent Gaussian metallicity, we find that, despite certain limitations, the “two-step heating” mechanism is still important in shaping the Galactic VMG. If the bar and buckling instabilities contributed to the formation of boxy/peanut-shaped bulges, then the “two-step heating” mechanism is inevitable in the secular evolution of a boxy/peanut-shaped bulge.

In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the IRS 17 filament within the intermediate-mass protocluster IRAS 08448-4343 (of ∼103L⊙), using ALMA data from the ATOMS 3 mm and QUARKS 1.3 mm surveys. The IRS 17 filament, which spans ∼54,000 au (0.26 pc) in length and ∼4000 au (0.02 pc) in width, exhibits a complex, multicomponent velocity field and harbors hierarchical substructures. These substructures include three bundles of seven velocity-coherent fibers and 29 dense (n ∼ 108 cm−3) condensations. The fibers have a median length of ∼4500 au and a median width of ∼1400 au. Among these fibers, four are identified as “fertile,” each hosting at least three dense condensations, which are regarded as the “seeds” of star formation. While the detected cores are randomly spaced within the IRS 17 filament based on the 3 mm dust continuum image, periodic spacing (∼1600 au) of condensations is observed in the fertile fibers according to the 1.3 mm dust map, consistent with the predictions of linear isothermal cylinder fragmentation models. These findings underscore the crucial role of fibers in star formation and suggest a hierarchical fragmentation process that extends from the filament to the fibers and, ultimately, to the smallest-scale condensations.

红移z≳10处的亮星系的丰度大大超过了ΛCDM模型在较低红移处测得的星形成效率的外推所预期的值。文章探讨了这种现象与当前宇宙学模型中假定的暗能量(Λ)的关系，提出了一种假定Λ为基态的量子场的暗能量模型，并考察了这种模型对高红移处星系UV光度函数的影响。研究发现，这种模型自然地影响了红移10≲z≲15处的星系UV光度，且ΩΛ = [−0.6, −0.3]的取值与独立宇宙学探测所需的值非常一致。此外，这种模型对红移15≲z≲16处亮星系丰度的急剧下降提出了明确的预测。 <div>
Recent observations by JWST yield a large abundance of luminous galaxies at z ≳ 10 compared to that expected in the ΛCDM scenario based on extrapolations of the star formation efficiency measured at lower redshifts. While several astrophysical processes can be responsible for such observations, here we explore to what extent such an effect can be rooted in the assumed dark energy (DE) sector of the current cosmological model. This is motivated by recent results from different cosmological probes combined with the last data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, which indicate a tension in the DE sector of the concordance ΛCDM model. We have considered the effect of assuming a DE characterized by a negative Λ as the ground state of a quintessence field on the galaxy luminosity function at high redshifts. We find that such models naturally affect the galaxy UV luminosities in the redshift range 10 ≲ z ≲ 15 needed to match the JWST observations, and with the value of ΩΛ = [−0.6, −0.3] remarkably consistent with that required by independent cosmological probes. A sharp prediction of such models is the steep decline of the abundance of bright galaxies in the redshift range 15 ≲ z ≲ 16.

该研究分析了PDS 456这一极端明亮的类星体的JWST MIRI/Medium Resolution Spectroscopy (MRS)数据，发现了延伸至15千秒差距的多相气体流出，包括温暖分子气体和离子化气体的发射。研究还显示，这一强大的类星体在广泛范围内驱动了辐射驱动风，并改变了宿主星系的离子化结构。尽管PDS 456的极端亮度使得即使在这一邻近对象中也很难研究其延伸发射，但通过使用 NIRSpec 和 MUSE IFS 数据立方体，成功地减轻了MIRI/MRS仪器效应。通过在源内和源外进行了核心尘埃发射的探测，研究团队的工作为了解宇宙中的类星体贡献了重要的信息。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究分析了PDS 456极端明亮的类星体的MIRI/MRS数据，发现了多相气体流出和辐射驱动风，以及对宿主星系离子化结构的影响。 <div>
Fast accreting, extremely luminous quasars contribute heavily to the feedback process within galaxies. While these systems are most common at cosmic noon (z ∼ 2), here we choose to study PDS 456, an extremely luminous (Lbol ∼ 1047 erg s−1) but nearby (z ∼ 0.185) quasar where the physics of feedback can be studied in greater detail. We present the results from our analysis of the JWST MIRI/Medium Resolution Spectroscopy (MRS) integral field spectroscopic (IFS) data of this object. The extreme brightness of PDS 456 makes it challenging to study the extended emission even in this nearby object. MIRI/MRS instrumental effects are mitigated by using complementary NIRSpec and MUSE IFS data cubes. We show clear evidence of a multiphase gas outflow extending up to 15 kpc from the central source. This includes emission from warm molecular (H2ν = 0–0 and 1–0) and ionized (e.g., Paα, [O iii], [Ne iii], and [Ne vi]) gas with typical blueshifted velocities down to −500 km s−1. We are also able to probe the nuclear dust emission in this source through silicate and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission features but are unable to spatially resolve it. Our results are consistent with this powerful quasar driving a radiatively driven wind over a broad range of distances and altering the ionization structure of the host galaxy.

中国地震电磁卫星上的高能粒子探测器（HEPD-01）采集了2018年8月至2022年6月的事件率数据，并检测到与GRB候选源相关的12个显著超额。这些数据经过建模、比对和分析，生成了0.3-50MeV光子的光子曲线和GRB观测时间、持续时间、积分计数和通量的观测目录。这些结果对比其他空间望远镜的发现，为GRB的研究提供了重要数据。 <div>
The High-Energy Particle Detector (HEPD-01) on board the China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite, located on a Sun-synchronous orbit at 500 km of altitude with an inclination of 97°, features a dedicated logic counting low-energy event rates, which proved sensitive to intense Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB). The present work reports a comprehensive analysis of signals induced by GRBs in the event-rate data collected between 2018 August and 2022 June. After accurately modeling the background rate as observed in different passages of the satellite over the same geographical area, we detected significant deviations to be compared with observations of GRB candidates from other observatories. The analysis revealed 12 statistically significant excesses, that have been associated with GRB 181222B, GRB 190114C, GRB 190129B, GRB 190305A, GRB 190928A, GRB 200412B, GRB 200422A, GRB 200826B, GRB 201009A, GRB 210702A, GRB 211211A, and GRB 220624A. We report light curves for 0.3–50 MeV photons, comparing them with findings from other space telescopes. The catalog of observations is published, complete of GRB observation time, duration, integrated counts, and fluence.

<div> 关键词: 行星大气，污染，行星形成，水和硅酸盐，化学组成

总结: 通过模拟行星大气的污染过程，研究了外行星的初始化学成分如何可能被改变。研究发现，通过不同尺寸和成分的行星碎片的蒸发，行星大气污染将受到热状态的饱和限制。水冰的污染可以导致大气中水质量分数变化2-4个数量级。这意味着后期污染可能会消除形成时的化学成分记忆，使原本在冰线外形成的外行星可能会转变为水世界。同时，还讨论了在水和难挥发的碳物质污染下的预期碳氧比例分布。 <div>
The atmospheric composition of exoplanets is often considered as a probe of the planet’s formation conditions. How exactly the initial chemical memory may be altered from the birth to the final state of the planet, however, remains unknown. Here, we develop a simple model of pollution of planetary atmosphere by the vaporization of infalling planetesimals of varying sizes and composition (SiO2 inside 1 au and H2O outside 1 au), following their trajectory and thermal evolution through the upper advective and radiative layers of a sub-Neptune-class planet during the late stage of disk evolution. We vary the rate of pollution by changing the solid content of the disk and by dialing the level of disk gas depletion, which in turn determines the rate of planetary migration. We find that pollution by silicate grains will always be limited by the saturation limit set by the thermal state of the atmosphere. By contrast, pollution by water ice can lead to ∼2–4 orders of magnitude variation in the atmospheric water mass fraction depending on the solid and gas content of the disk. Both cases suggest that post-formation pollution can erase the initial compositional memory of formation. Post-formation pollution can potentially transform sub-Neptunes with H/He-dominated envelopes that initially formed beyond the ice line to water worlds (i.e., with a water-enriched envelope) when the disk gas is depleted by ≳2 orders of magnitude, allowing gentle migration. We additionally discuss the expected C/O ratio profile under pollution by water and refractory carbon species.

利用开普勒观测到的恒星数据，结合之前的研究成果，对FGK类恒星的自转周期和锂含量进行分析，得出了这些参数可以作为恒星年龄的经验指标。研究结果表明，通过自转周期得出的恒星年龄与开放星团中的恒星年龄一致，并且与独立的锂年龄结果相符。在Kepler观测过的23813颗恒星中，有63颗行星的年龄小于10亿岁，而有109颗行星的年龄中值低于10亿岁，这一结果与之前的假设不符，表明Kepler观测到的年轻恒星数量比年龄为30亿岁的恒星少3至5倍。这种现象的出现是由于恒星运动速度增加和银河薄盘恒星形成速率下降的综合因素，对已知的过境外行星的年龄分布产生了影响。<br /><br />总结: 利用Kepler观测数据，研究了FGK类恒星的自转周期和锂含量对恒星年龄的影响。结果显示Kepler观测到的年轻恒星数量与传统假设不符，这可能是由于恒星运动速度增加和银河薄盘恒星形成速率下降所致。 <div>
Recent analyses of FGK stars in open clusters have helped clarify the precision with which a star’s rotation rate and lithium content can be used as empirical indicators for its age. Here we apply this knowledge to stars observed by Kepler. Rotation periods are drawn from previous work; lithium is measured from new and archival Keck/HIRES spectra. We report rotation-based ages for 23,813 stars (harboring 795 known planets) for which our method is applicable. We find that our rotational ages recover the ages of stars in open clusters spanning 0.04–2.5 Gyr; they also agree with ≳90% of the independent lithium ages. The resulting yield includes 63 planets younger than 1 Gyr at 2σ, and 109 with median ages below 1 Gyr. This is about half the number expected under the classic assumption of a uniform star formation history. The age distribution that we observe, rather than being uniform, shows that the youngest stars in the Kepler field are 3–5 times rarer than stars 3 Gyr old. This trend holds for both known planet hosts and for the parent stellar sample. We attribute this “demographic cliff” to a combination of kinematic heating and a declining star formation rate in the Galaxy’s thin disk, and highlight its impact on the age distribution of known transiting exoplanets.

<div> 关键词: 太阳耀斑, 电子加速, 太阳射电爆发, 电子输运, 空间天气事件
总结:
太阳耀斑引起的电子加速和观测到的III型太阳射电爆发不仅是理解内部太阳圈层电子输运的重要诊断工具，而且可能是潜在有害空间天气事件的早期指示。电子束在太阳冕层和太阳圈层沿磁场线传播产生朗缪波，并在速度空间中准线性地松弛达到一个平台。在短距离上观察到的电子束松弛与观测到的大束游程距离形成对比，通常被称为Sturrok的困境。该研究开发了一种新的电子输运模型，其准线性距离/时间在空间和时间上自洽地变化。该模型导出了电子束密度的非线性对流扩散方程，其非线性扩散项与束密度成反比。该解预测了快速传播电子束的缓慢超扩散（弹道）空间扩展。该模型还提供了朗缪波的谱能量密度演变，决定了太阳爆发等离子辐射的亮度温度。该模型解与使用动力学方程数值模拟的结果一致，并可以解释一些III型太阳射电爆发的特征。 <div>
Electrons accelerated by solar flares and observed as type III solar radio bursts are not only a crucial diagnostic tool for understanding electron transport in the inner heliosphere but also a possible early indication of potentially hazardous space weather events. The electron beams traveling in the solar corona and heliosphere along magnetic field lines generate Langmuir waves and quasilinearly relax toward a plateau in velocity space. The relaxation of the electron beam over the short distance in contrast to large beam-travel distances observed is often referred to as Sturrok’s dilemma. Here, we develop a new electron transport model with quasilinear distance/time self-consistently changing in space and time. This model results in a nonlinear advection-diffusion equation for the electron beam density with a nonlinear diffusion term that is inversely proportional to the beam density. The solution predicts slow super-diffusive (ballistic) spatial expansion of a fast-propagating electron beam. This model also provides the evolution of the spectral energy density of Langmuir waves, which determines brightness temperature of plasma radiation in solar bursts. The model solution is consistent with the results of numerical simulation using kinetic equations and can explain some characteristics of type III solar radio bursts.

Several hundreds of thousands of eclipsing binaries (EBs) are expected to be detected in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) full frame images (FFIs). This represents a significant increase in the number of EBs available for eclipse timing variation studies. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of performing precise eclipse timing of TESS EBs using the FFIs. To this end, we developed a fast, automated method and applied it to a sample of ∼100 EBs selected from the Villanova TESS EB catalog. Our timing analysis resulted in the detection of 10 new triple candidates with outer periods shorter than ∼1300 days. For five of them, we were able to constrain the outer orbit by analyzing independently the short-cadence (SC) and FFI data and to derive the minimum mass of the third body with a precision better than 4% for SC and 11% for FFI data. We then compared the results obtained from the two data sets and found that using the FFI data leads to (1) a degradation of both the accuracy and precision of the tertiary mass determination for the tightest EBs and (2) an overall underestimation of the third component’s mass. However, we stress that our main conclusions on the nature of the detected signals do not depend on which data set is used. This confirms the great potential of TESS FFIs, which will allow us to search for rare objects such as substellar circumbinary companions and compact triple stellar systems.

本文利用磷-氢-氧（PHO）光化学网络，模拟了氢为主要成分的热木星和暖海王星系外行星大气中的磷化氢光化学过程。结果显示，在类似HD 189733b热木星的大气中，对过境和发射光谱重要的压力范围内，HOPO、PO和P2通常是主要的磷携带者，而不是PH3。而对于类似GJ1214b的暖海王星大气，结果表明，在太阳金属丰度下，PH3在没有光化学作用的情况下占主导地位，但在其他化学环境中通常不会存在大量PH3。在10和100倍太阳金属丰度下，氧化磷小分子如HOPO和PO在热化学和光化学模拟中占主导地位。虽然改进了PHO网络的精度，但仍有大量反应速率数据是不确定或缺失的，这可能会对目前的研究结论产生重大影响。未来，改进对含磷化学反应动力学的理解将成为天文学家在近期内探测含磷物质（如磷化氢）的关键工作。 <br /><br />总结: 本文使用PHO光化学网络模拟了热木星和暖海王星系外行星大气中的磷化氢光化学过程，发现在不同的化学环境下，磷化氢和其他磷物质的丰度存在显著差异。然而，网络中仍有大量反应速率数据是不确定或缺失的，需要进行进一步的研究和完善。 <div>
Due to the detection of phosphine (PH3) in the solar system gas giants Jupiter and Saturn, PH3 has long been suggested to be detectable in exosolar substellar atmospheres too. However, to date, direct detection of phosphine has proven to be elusive in exoplanet atmosphere surveys. We construct an updated phosphorus-hydrogen-oxygen (PHO) photochemical network suitable for the simulation of gas giant hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. Using this network, we examine PHO photochemistry in hot Jupiter and warm Neptune exoplanet atmospheres at solar and enriched metallicities. Our results show for HD 189733b-like hot Jupiters that HOPO, PO, and P2 are typically the dominant P carriers at pressures important for transit and emission spectra, rather than PH3. For GJ1214b-like warm Neptune atmospheres our results suggest that at solar metallicity PH3 is dominant in the absence of photochemistry, but is generally not in high abundance for all other chemical environments. At 10 and 100 times solar, small oxygenated phosphorus molecules such as HOPO and PO dominate for both thermochemical and photochemical simulations. The network is able to reproduce well the observed PH3 abundances on Jupiter and Saturn. Despite progress in improving the accuracy of the PHO network, large portions of the reaction rate data remain with approximate, uncertain, or missing values, which could change the conclusions of the current study significantly. Improving understanding of the kinetics of phosphorus-bearing chemical reactions will be a key undertaking for astronomers aiming to detect phosphine and other phosphorus species in both rocky and gaseous exoplanetary atmospheres in the near future.

WTP 19aalnxx是一颗在KUG 0022-007星系外围发现的明亮的中红外瞬变体，表现出CSM相互作用迹象，并且在中红外波段的辐射强度超过光学波段。该瞬变体在2018年首次被发现，与2015年的光学对应源相比，其在4.6微米波段的峰值绝对明度约为-22Vega，并且在大约3年内达到了峰值。通过光谱能量分布建模，估计存在大约10^-2太阳质量的暖尘埃，可能是在冷密壳中形成的。深度光学光谱证实了强烈的CSM相互作用迹象。研究发现，还有16个核心坍缩超新星在NEOWISE数据中表现出延迟的红外明亮信号，这表明密集的CSM壳可能存在于小于10^17厘米的区域。同步红外调查为揭示晚期CSM相互作用提供了新的途径，也为探索大质量恒星的终末质量损失增加了见解。 <br /><br />总结: NEOWISE发现了一颗在星系外围的明亮中红外瞬变体WTP 19aalnxx，其在中红外波段的辐射强度超过光学波段。光学对应源在2015年时约为其5倍的光度。通过光谱能量分布建模，估计存在大约10^-2太阳质量的暖尘埃，可能是在冷密壳中形成的。16个核心坍缩超新星在NEOWISE数据中表现出延迟的红外明亮信号，这表明密集的CSM壳可能存在于小于10^17厘米的区域。 <div>
While core-collapse supernovae (SNe) often show early and consistent signs of circumstellar medium (CSM) interaction, some exhibit delayed signatures due to interaction with distant material around the progenitor star. Here we present the discovery in NEOWISE data of WTP 19aalnxx, a luminous mid-infrared (MIR) transient in the outskirts of the galaxy KUG 0022-007 at ≈190 Mpc. First detected in 2018, WTP 19aalnxx reaches a peak absolute (Vega) magnitude of ≈−22 at 4.6 μm in ≈3 yr, comparable to the most luminous interacting SNe. Archival data reveal a ≳5× fainter optical counterpart detected since 2015, while follow-up near-infrared observations in 2022 reveal an extremely red (Ks − W2 ≈ 3.7 mag) active transient. Deep optical spectroscopy confirm strong CSM interaction signatures via intermediate-width Balmer emission lines and coronal metal lines. Modeling the broadband spectral energy distribution, we estimate the presence of ≳10−2M⊙ of warm dust, likely formed in the cold dense shell. Together with the lack of nebular Fe emission, we suggest that WTP 19aalnxx is a missed, low (optical) luminosity SN in an emerging family of core-collapse SNe distinguished by their CSM-interaction-powered MIR emission that outshines the optical bands. Investigating the Zwicky Transient Facility sample of SNe with NEOWISE data, we find 16 core-collapse SNe (≳3% in a volume-limited sample) without early signs of CSM interaction that exhibit delayed IR brightening, suggestive of dense CSM shells at ≲1017 cm. We suggest that synoptic IR surveys offer a new route to revealing late-time CSM interaction and the prevalence of intense terminal mass loss in massive stars.

这篇论文探讨了恒星质量黑洞在X射线双星系统中的X射线光谱特征以及相关模型。其中提到了X射线谱的三个组成部分：来自薄冷吸积盘的热成分，来自热辐射区的康普顿化成分，以及由热辐射区照射冷吸积盘产生的反射成分。文中使用了灯柱状辐射区的模型，并对黑洞X射线双星系统的X射线光谱进行了改进计算。研究表明，反射光谱既有来自辐射区的直接辐射，也有来自热成分和反射成分的返回辐射。另外，通过计算来自X射线通量和局部电子密度的照射，自洽地计算了吸积盘的电离参数。最后，对模型的预测进行了讨论，并指出了当前的局限性以及改进的下一步计划。 <div>
In the disk–corona model, the X-ray spectrum of a stellar-mass black hole in an X-ray binary is characterized by three components: a thermal component from a thin and cold accretion disk, a Comptonized component from a hot corona, and a reflection component produced by illumination of the cold disk by the hot corona. In this paper, we assume a lamppost corona, and we improve previous calculations of the X-ray spectrum of black hole X-ray binaries. The reflection spectrum is produced by the direct radiation from the corona as well as by the returning radiation of the thermal and reflection components and is calculated considering the actual spectrum illuminating the disk. If we turn the corona off, the reflection spectrum is completely generated by the returning radiation of the thermal component, as it may happen for some sources in soft spectral states. After choosing the radial density profile of the accretion disk, the ionization parameter is calculated self-consistently at any radial coordinate of the disk from the illuminating X-ray flux and the local electron density. We show the predictions of our model in different regimes, and we discuss its current limitations as well as the next steps to improve it.

脉冲星Calvera的新准确视运动和相位连接的星历使用了Chandra和NICER观测数据。Calvera的视运动指向一个环形射电环的中心，这与以往低显著性的测量结果有很大不同。这为超新星遗迹与脉冲星的关联提供了更简单的解释，并且支持了超新星确实在不到10千年前诞生了Calvera，当时它的自转周期接近现在的值。脉冲星的切向速度取决于其不确定的距离，但可能主要受超新星的脱逃动力学影响，而其祖星可能是银河盘附近的一个O或B型星。 <br /><br />总结：这篇文章报道了脉冲星Calvera的新观测结果和新星历的推导，证实了其与一个超新星遗迹的关联，推测了其诞生不到10千年，并提出了其祖星可能是一个银河盘附近的超新星。 <div>
Calvera (1RXS J141256.0+792204) is a pulsar of characteristic age 285 kyr at a high Galactic latitude of b = +37°, detected only in soft thermal X-rays. We measure a new and precise proper motion for Calvera using Chandra High Resolution Camera observations obtained 10 yr apart. We also derive a new phase-connected ephemeris using 6 yr of NICER data, including the astrometric position and proper motion as fixed parameters in the timing solution. Calvera is located near the center of a faint, circular radio ring that was recently discovered by LOFAR and confirmed as a supernova remnant (SNR) by the detection of γ-ray emission with Fermi Large Area Telescope. The proper motion of 78.5 ± 2.9 mas yr−1 at position angle 241.°3 ± 2.°2 (in Galactic coordinates) points away from the center of the ring, a result which differs markedly from a previous low-significance measurement, and greatly simplifies the interpretation of the SNR/pulsar association. It argues that the supernova indeed birthed Calvera <10 kyr ago, with an initial spin period close to its present value of 59 ms. The tangential velocity of the pulsar depends on its uncertain distance, vt = (372 ± 14)d1 kpc km s−1, but is probably dominated by the supernova kick, while its progenitor could have been a runaway O or B star from the Galactic disk.

<title>Do Strong Bars Exhibit Strong Noncircular Motions?</title>

Galactic bars induce characteristic motions deviating from pure circular rotation, known as noncircular motions. As bars are nonaxisymmetric structures, stronger bars are expected to show stronger noncircular motions. However, this has not yet been confirmed by observations. We use a bisymmetric model to account for the stellar kinematics of 14 barred galaxies obtained with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer and characterize the degree of bar-driven noncircular motions. For the first time, we find tight relations between the bar strength (bar ellipticity and torque parameter) and the degree of stellar noncircular motions. We also find that the bar strength is strongly associated with the stellar radial velocity driven by bars. Our results imply that stronger bars exhibit stronger noncircular motions. Noncircular motions beyond the bar are found to be weak, comprising less than 10% of the strength of the circular motions. We find that galaxies with a boxy/peanut (B/P) bulge exhibit a higher degree of noncircular motions and higher stellar radial velocity compared to galaxies without a B/P bulge, by 30% ∼ 50%. However, this effect could be attributed to the presence of strong bars in galaxies with a B/P feature in our sample, which would naturally result in higher radial motions, rather than to the B/P bulges themselves inducing stronger radial motions. More observational studies, utilizing both stellar and gaseous kinematics on statistically complete samples, along with numerical studies are necessary to draw a comprehensive view of the impact that B/P bulges have on bar-driven noncircular motions.

<div> 关键词: Galactic cosmic rays, solar modulation, heliosphere, force-field approximation, AMS-02 data
总结:
本研究利用AMS-02月度数据，通过月度数据对质子和氦的通量以及它们的比值的变化进行分析，研究了2011年5月至2017年5月的太阳调制的演变。研究利用非参数化方法推导了质子和氦的局部星际光谱，并对高能和低能范围分别赋予不同的太阳调制电位，利用Sigmoid函数描述了它们之间的过渡。分析发现，质子和氦通量的突变出现在大约6 GV的刚度值处，而且在HMF反转期间这一突变更加明显。此外，研究还发现质子和氦的长期比率变化可以从模型中自然推导出来，考虑了不同的Z/A值和质子和氦的局部星际光谱。  <br /><br /> <div>
Galactic cosmic rays suffer from solar modulation when they propagate through the heliosphere. The transfer of the local interstellar spectrum (LIS) to the top-of-atmosphere spectra is influenced by solar wind convection, and diffusion on the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF), among other factors. In this work, we derive the LIS of proton (p) and helium (He) covering energies from a few MeV/n to TeV/n, using a nonparameterization method. The study utilizes monthly AMS-02 data on proton and helium fluxes and their ratio to examine the evolution of solar modulation from 2011 May to 2017 May. To improve the fitting, the force-field approximation is modified by assigning different solar modulation potentials for high (ϕh) and low (ϕl) energy ranges. A sigmoid function is employed to describe the transition between these energy ranges. The analysis reveals that the break in proton and helium fluxes occurs at the same rigidity value, with a mean of approximately 6 GV and this break is more pronounced during the HMF reversal period. The ϕl is close to the result of Advanced Composition Explorer while the ϕh is close to the result of neutron monitor data. Furthermore, the long-term behavior of the proton-to-helium ratio ratio is found to naturally arise from the model when considering different Z/A values and the LISs for proton and helium.

总结: 
NGC 99是一个活跃的星系，研究人员通过光谱学和观测数据，发现了该星系内部的金属丰度梯度。两个异常低金属丰度区域显示出与其他区域不同的特征，这被解释为气体吸积的间接证据。此外，研究还发现星系内部的星际介质与周银河介质中的Lyα云可能存在共转运动，可能是低金属丰度气体吸积的一种可能途径。最后，研究人员使用局部气相金属丰度、恒星质量面密度和恒星形成率面密度计算了解决的基本金属丰度关系，发现了与之前研究得出的结果相似的趋势。 <div>
As a part of the Deciphering the Interplay between the Interstellar medium, Stars, and the Circumgalactic medium (DIISC) survey, we investigate indirect evidence of gas inflow into the disk of the galaxy NGC 99. We combine optical spectra from the Binospec spectrograph on the MMT telescope with optical imaging data from the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope, radio H i 21 cm emission images from the NSF Karl G. Jansky’s Very Large Array, and UV spectroscopy from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. We measure emission lines (Hα, Hβ, [O iii]λ5007, [N ii]λ6583, and [S ii]λ6717, 31) in 26 H ii regions scattered about the galaxy and estimate a radial metallicity gradient of −0.017 dex kpc−1 using the N2 metallicity indicator. Two regions in the sample exhibit an anomalously low metallicity (ALM) of 12 + log(O/H) = 8.36 dex, which is ∼0.16 dex lower than other regions at that galactocentric radius. They also show a high difference between their H i and Hα line of sight velocities on the order of 35 km s−1. Chemical evolution modeling indicates gas accretion as the cause of the ALM regions. We find evidence for corotation between the interstellar medium of NGC 99 and Lyα clouds in its circumgalactic medium, which suggests a possible pathway for low metallicity gas accretion. We also calculate the resolved Fundamental Metallicity Relation (rFMR) on subkiloparsec scales using localized gas-phase metallicity, stellar mass surface density, and star formation rate surface density. The rFMR shows a similar trend as that found by previous localized and global FMR relations.

The National Science Foundation’s Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) will provide high-resolution, multiline spectropolarimetric observations that are poised to revolutionize our understanding of the Sun. Given the massive data volume, novel inference techniques are required to unlock its full potential. Here, we provide an overview of our “SPIn4D” project, which aims to develop deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for estimating the physical properties of the solar photosphere from DKIST spectropolarimetric observations. We describe the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling and the Stokes profile synthesis pipeline that produce the simulated output and input data, respectively. These data will be used to train a set of CNNs that can rapidly infer the four-dimensional MHD state vectors by exploiting the spatiotemporally coherent patterns in the Stokes profile time series. Specifically, our radiative MHD model simulates the small-scale dynamo actions that are prevalent in quiet-Sun and plage regions. Six cases with different mean magnetic fields have been explored; each case covers six solar-hours, totaling 109 TB in data volume. The simulation domain covers at least 25 × 25 × 8 Mm, with 16 × 16 × 12 km spatial resolution, extending from the upper convection zone up to the temperature minimum region. The outputs are stored at a 40 s cadence. We forward model the Stokes profile of two sets of Fe i lines at 630 and 1565 nm, which will be simultaneously observed by DKIST and can better constrain the parameter variations along the line of sight. The MHD model output and the synthetic Stokes profiles are publicly available, with 13.7 TB in the initial release.

<div> 脉冲星，伽马射线，周期振荡，双超大质量黑洞系统，多波段观测
<br /><br />总结:
本研究使用了15年的Fermi天文台观测数据，发现了PG 1553+113类星体的伽马射线流量存在2.1年周期振荡。观测数据显示了大于7个周期的伽马射线调制，具有4σ的显著性。光学和射电光变曲线与伽马射线调制表现出明显的相关性，可能有不同的时间滞后。研究指出，这种伽马射线的周期性可能来源于一个双超大质量黑洞系统，其中一个黑洞的质量比较大，产生周期性的星体吸积流，影响喷流的物质和能量。其他可能的天体物理情景包括不稳定性、盘和喷流的进动、自转或章动，以及处于极坐标轨道的大质量星体或中等质量黑洞的扰动。 <div>
A 2.1 yr periodic oscillation of the gamma-ray flux from the blazar PG 1553+113 has previously been tentatively identified in ∼7 yr of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. After 15 yr of Fermi sky-survey observations, doubling the total time range, we report >7 cycle gamma-ray modulation with an estimated significance of 4σ against stochastic red noise. Independent determinations of oscillation period and phase in the earlier and the new data are in close agreement (chance probability <0.01). Pulse timing over the full light curve is also consistent with a coherent periodicity. Multiwavelength new data from Swift X-Ray Telescope, Burst Alert Telescope, and UVOT, and from KAIT, Catalina Sky Survey, All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, and Owens Valley Radio Observatory ground-based observatories as well as archival Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer satellite-All Sky Monitor data, published optical data of Tuorla, and optical historical Harvard plates data are included in our work. Optical and radio light curves show clear correlations with the gamma-ray modulation, possibly with a nonconstant time lag for the radio flux. We interpret the gamma-ray periodicity as possibly arising from a pulsational accretion flow in a sub-parsec binary supermassive black hole system of elevated mass ratio, with orbital modulation of the supplied material and energy in the jet. Other astrophysical scenarios introduced include instabilities, disk and jet precession, rotation or nutation, and perturbations by massive stars or intermediate-mass black holes in polar orbit.

本文介绍了Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument (MIRI) Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES)，这是一项利用James Webb Space Telescope拍摄的八波段MIRI调查，并在GOODS-S/HUDF区域进行近红外光谱仪的后续研究的项目。SMILES利用MIRI的连续覆盖面积从5.6到25.5μm，极大地扩展了我们对被遮挡的宇宙的理解。文章还介绍了提供的初步数据，包括八个MIRI成像拼接图和一个5-25.5μm的光度目录。SMILES的研究结果将极大地拓展我们对被遮挡的宇宙的认识。 <div>
The James Webb Space Telescope is revolutionizing our view of the Universe through unprecedented sensitivity and resolution in the infrared, with some of the largest gains realized at its longest wavelengths. We present the Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument (MIRI) Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES), an eight-band MIRI survey with Near-Infrared Spectrograph spectroscopic follow-up in the GOODS-S/HUDF region. SMILES takes full advantage of MIRI’s continuous coverage from 5.6 to 25.5 μm over an ∼34 arcmin2 area to greatly expand our understanding of the obscured Universe up to cosmic noon and beyond. This work, together with a companion paper by G. Rieke et al., covers the SMILES science drivers and technical design, early results with SMILES, data reduction, photometric catalog creation, and the first data release. As part of the discussion on early results, we additionally present a high-level science demonstration on how MIRI’s wavelength coverage and resolution will advance our understanding of cosmic dust using the full range of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission features from 3.3 to 18 μm. Using custom background subtraction, we produce robust reductions of the MIRI imaging that maximize the depths reached with our modest exposure times (∼0.6−2.2 ks per filter). Included in our initial data release are (1) eight MIRI imaging mosaics reaching depths of 0.2−18 μJy (5σ) and (2) a 5−25.5 μm photometric catalog with over 3000 sources. Building upon the rich legacy of extensive photometric and spectroscopy coverage of GOODS-S/HUDF from the X-ray to the radio, SMILES greatly expands our investigative power in understanding the obscured Universe.

<div> 联系双星，光变曲线，频谱分析，长期变化，物理参数
<br />
这篇论文通过对八个全食接触双星进行光度和光谱研究。使用里昂大学发展的光谱分析软件分析了光谱数据，并使用PHOEBE和马尔科夫链蒙特卡洛采样对光度数据进行了分析。研究中使用了两种方法来计算MCMC的初始值：一种是我们提出的新方法，用于模拟不带斑点的光变曲线，而另一种是遗传算法，用于确定带斑点的物理参数。研究结果表明，这八个目标都是接触双星，质量比小于0.25。其中四个系统呈现了O'Connell效应，在主要组件上添加一个黑斑可以得到理想的拟合。与此同时，发现两个系统是浅接触双星，而其余六个是中等接触双星。另外，对这八颗食双星进行了O-C分析，发现其中七颗呈现出长期变化。其中四颗显示出轨道周期的长期减小趋势，而其他三颗显示出轨道周期的长期增加趋势，还有两个目标呈现周期性变化。周期的减小可能是由于质量从更大的组件转移到更小的组件，而增加可能是由于质量转移方向的相反。此外，还计算了这八个系统的绝对物理参数、轨道角动量、初始质量和年龄，并分析了它们的质量-光度和质量-半径分布。 
<br /><br />总结: 这项研究表明了八颗全食接触双星的特征，并发现了它们的长期变化规律，从而得出了它们的物理参数和质量-光度、质量-半径分布。 <div>
This paper selected eight totally eclipsing contact binaries for photometric and spectroscopic studies. Spectral data were analyzed by University of Lyon Spectroscopic analysis Software, and photometric data were analyzed using PHOEBE through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. We used two methods to calculate the initial values for running MCMC: one method is a new approach proposed by ourselves to model light curves without spots, while the other method is the genetic algorithm, which can determine physical parameters with spots. The results imply that these eight targets are all contact binary stars with a small mass ratio below 0.25. There are four systems exhibiting the O’Connell effect. By adding a dark spot on the primary component, the ideal fitting can be obtained. Meanwhile, it was found that two systems are shallow contact binaries, while the remaining six are moderate contact binaries. An O − C analysis of the eight eclipsing binary stars revealed that seven of them exhibit long-term changes. Four of them display a long-term decreasing trend in orbital period, while the other three show a long-term increasing trend, and two targets exhibit periodic variations. A decrease in period may be caused by the transfer of matter from the more massive component to the less massive component, while an increase in period may be caused by transfer in the opposite way. The absolute physical parameters, orbital angular momentum, initial masses, and ages of these eight systems were calculated. Additionally, their mass–luminosity and mass–radius distributions were analyzed.

Metals in the diffuse, ionized gas at the boundary between the Milky Way’s interstellar medium (ISM) and circumgalactic medium, known as the disk–halo interface (DHI), are valuable tracers of the feedback processes that drive the Galactic fountain. However, metallicity measurements in this region are challenging due to obscuration by the Milky Way ISM and uncertain ionization corrections that affect the total hydrogen column density. In this work, we constrain ionization corrections to neutral hydrogen column densities using precisely measured electron column densities from the dispersion measures of pulsars that lie in the same globular clusters as UV-bright targets with high-resolution absorption spectroscopy. We address the blending of absorption lines with the ISM by jointly fitting Voigt profiles to all absorption components. We present our metallicity estimates for the DHI of the Milky Way based on detailed photoionization modeling of the absorption from ionized metal lines and ionization-corrected total hydrogen columns. Generally, the gas clouds show a large scatter in metallicity, ranging between 0.04 and 3.2 Z⊙, implying that the DHI consists of a mixture of gaseous structures having multiple origins. We estimate the inflow and outflow timescales of the DHI ionized clouds to be 6–35 Myr. We report the detection of an infalling cloud with supersolar metallicity that suggests a Galactic fountain mechanism, whereas at least one low-metallicity outflowing cloud (Z < 0.1 Z⊙) poses a challenge for Galactic fountain and feedback models.

总结:
本文开发了基于Python的先进次海王星演化模型，同时考虑了幼年时期≤1 Myr的形成后沸腾和来自内部冷却的长寿命核动力损失(∼Gyr)。我们研究了初始H/He熵、核发光、能量对流、辐射大气结构以及过渡到X射线和紫外驱动的质量损失阶段在行星质量损失和热演化方面的作用。特别着重于H/He包层的再平衡过程，包括推动流体动力风的能源和能量传输时间尺度，我们发现沸腾和核动力逃逸主要由恒星总辐射驱动。我们进一步发现，沸腾和核动力逃逸与热演化脱节。我们发现，考虑初始H/He质量分数和初始熵的沸腾阶段后，后续的核动力逃逸对小行星的统计特征影响微乎其微，因为它最多只能去掉0.1%的H/He质量分数。我们直接将数值结果与先前关于个体演化轨迹和小行星族群的分析核动力质量损失建模的工作进行了比较。我们检查了先前研究中做出的一些假设，这些假设与我们的发现相比造成了显著差异。我们发现，虽然沸腾能够完全从一个高辐射(≥100 F⊕)、低质量核心(Mc ≤ 4 M⊕)的行星上剥离气态包层，但无法单独形成观测到的小行星族群中看到的明显半径差。 <div>
We develop a Python-based state-of-the-art sub-Neptune evolution model that incorporates both the post-formation boil-off at young ages ≤1 Myr and long-lived core-powered mass loss (∼Gyr) from interior cooling. We investigate the roles of initial H/He entropy, core luminosity, energy advection, radiative atmospheric structure, and the transition to an X-ray- and ultraviolet-driven mass-loss phase, with an eye on relevant timescales for planetary mass loss and thermal evolution. With particular attention to the re-equilibration process of the H/He envelope, including the energy sources that fuel the hydrodynamic wind, and energy transport timescales, we find that boil-off and core-powered escape are primarily driven by stellar bolometric radiation. We further find that both boil-off and core-powered escape are decoupled from the thermal evolution. We show that, with a boil-off phase that accounts for the initial H/He mass fraction and initial entropy, post-boil-off core-powered escape has an insignificant influence on the demographics of small planets, as it is only able to remove at most 0.1% of the H/He mass fraction. Our numerical results are directly compared to previous work on analytical core-powered mass-loss modeling for individual evolutionary trajectories and populations of small planets. We examine a number of assumptions made in previous studies that cause significant differences compared to our findings. We find that boil-off, though able to completely strip the gaseous envelope from a highly irradiated (F ≥ 100 F⊕) planet that has a low-mass core (Mc ≤ 4 M⊕), cannot by itself form a pronounced radius gap as is seen in the observed population.

The magnetic cloud within an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) is characterized by high magnetic field intensities. In this study, we investigate the interaction of a magnetic cloud carrying a density structure with the Earth’s bow shock during the ICME event on 2023 April 24. Elevated abundances of cold protons and heavier ions, namely, alpha particles and singly charged helium ions, associated with the prominence plasma are observed within this structure. The plasma downstream of the bow shock exhibits an irregular compression pattern, which could be due to the presence of heavy ions. Heavy ions carry a significant fraction of the upstream flow energy; however, due to their different mass-per-charge ratio and rigidity, they are less scattered by the electromagnetic and electrostatic waves at the shock. We find that downstream of the shock, while the ion thermal energy is only a small fraction of the background magnetic energy, nevertheless increased ion fluxes reduce the characteristic wave speeds in that region. As such, we observe a transition state of an unstable bow shock in which the plasma flow is super Alfvénic both upstream and downstream of the bow shock. Our findings help with the understanding of the intense space weather impacts of such events.

红外微弱的白矮星通常被认为是由于H2-He的碰撞诱导吸收引起的红外光谱缺失。这篇文章使用詹姆斯·韦伯空间望远镜对LHS 3250、WD J1922+0233和LHS 1126进行了近红外和中红外光谱观测。观测结果表明，LHS 3250在2.4微米处观测到了一个意外的小的流量峰，而不是预期的H2-He吸收。WD J1922+0233在2.4微米处观测到了预期强烈的吸收特征，但是在这个吸收带内部观测到了意想不到的窄的发射特征。LHS 1126在中红外没有观测到H2-He的吸收特征，并且在中红外呈现出λ^-2的功率律。这些发现表明IR微弱的白矮星可能比先前认为的温暖且更为庞大，这需要进一步的JWST观测来加以确认。此外，研究探讨了这两颗星体中意想不到的发射特征的可能解释，温度反转在此被认为是一个有希望的假设。这些发现可能影响它们的光度拟合，强调了进一步的JWST观测对这一现象的普遍性进行确认和改进大气模型的重要性。
<br /><br />总结:这篇文章观测了三颗红外微弱的白矮星的近红外和中红外光谱。观测结果显示，一颗白矮星出现了意外的小的流量峰，另一颗出现了窄的发射特征，还有一颗在中红外呈现出λ^-2的功率律。这些发现表明红外微弱的白矮星可能比先前认为的温暖且更为庞大。研究探讨了这两颗星体中意想不到的发射特征的可能解释，认为温度反转在此是一个有希望的假设。这些发现强调了进一步的观测对这一现象的普遍性进行确认和改进大气模型的重要性。 <div>
Infrared-faint white dwarfs are cool white dwarfs exhibiting significant infrared flux deficits, most often attributed to collision-induced absorption (CIA) from H2–He in mixed hydrogen–helium atmospheres. We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) near- and mid-infrared spectra of three such objects using Near-Infrared Spectrograph (0.6–5.3 μm) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (5–14 μm): LHS 3250, WD J1922+0233, and LHS 1126. Surprisingly, for LHS 3250, we detect no H2–He CIA absorption at 2.4 μm, instead observing an unexpected small flux bump at this wavelength. WD J1922+0233 exhibits the anticipated strong absorption feature centered at 2.4 μm, but with an unexpected narrow emission-like feature inside this absorption band. LHS 1126 shows no CIA features and follows a λ−2 power law in the mid-infrared. LHS 1126's lack of CIA features suggests a very low hydrogen abundance, with its infrared flux depletion likely caused by He–He–He CIA. For LHS 3250 and WD J1922+0233, the absence of a 1.2 μm CIA feature in both stars argues against ultracool temperatures, supporting recent suggestions that infrared-faint (IR-faint) white dwarfs are warmer and more massive than previously thought. This conclusion is further solidified by Keck near-infrared spectroscopy of seven additional objects. We explore possible explanations for the unexpected emission-like features in both stars, and temperature inversions above the photosphere emerge as a promising hypothesis. Such inversions may be common among the IR-faint population, and since they significantly affect the infrared spectral energy distribution, this would impact their photometric fits. Further JWST observations are needed to confirm the prevalence of this phenomenon and guide the development of improved atmospheric models.

该研究利用2014年至2018年的高分辨率光谱数据，对RS CVn型双星SZ Piscium (SZ Psc)的磁活跃K成分进行了九幅多普勒影像的展示。研究使用最小二乘去卷积（LSD）提取平均轮廓，重新构建表面图，并研究了K型次巨星的星斑、表面差分旋转以及三重星组件的吸收线。研究发现，K成分的星斑沿纬度和经度广泛分布，在相位0附近存在一个明显的极区非对称星斑，并且星斑在1个月的时间尺度内发生演变。通过交叉相关方法，确定了2017年11月至12月间相隔10天的星斑图，计算出K成分的表面差分旋转参数为Ωeq = 1.591 ± 0.002 rad day−1和ΔΩ = 0.035 ± 0.003 rad day−1。同时通过检测LSD轮廓中来自SZ Psc的三重星成分的吸收线，测量了双星系统和三重星成分的径向速度，得到了三重星成分的轨道周期为1530 ± 3天，质量为0.75 ± 0.06 M⊙。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究利用高分辨率光谱数据对SZ Piscium的磁活跃K成分进行了多普勒影像展示，揭示了其表面星斑分布和演变，以及表面差分旋转参数，并确定了三重星成分的轨道周期和质量。 <div>
We present a series of nine Doppler images of the magnetically active K component of the RS CVn-type binary SZ Piscium (SZ Psc), based on high-resolution spectroscopic data collected from 2014 to 2018. We apply least-squares deconvolution (LSD) to all spectra to extract the average profiles with high signal-to-noise ratios for Doppler imaging. The surface maps of the K subgiant show starspots widely distributed along its latitude and longitude. A prominent, nonaxisymmetric polar spot around phase 0 is revealed by all images with sufficient phase coverage, which may be a stable feature on the K component. The starspots evolve over a timescale of 1 month. We have determined the surface shear rate of the K component from starspot maps reconstructed 10 days apart in 2017 November–December through the cross-correlation method. The surface differential rotation parameters are Ωeq = 1.591 ± 0.002 rad day−1 and ΔΩ = 0.035 ± 0.003 rad day−1. The absorption lines contributed from the tertiary component of SZ Psc are detected in all LSD profiles, and we measure the radial velocity of the binary system and the tertiary component to derive an elliptical orbit with a period of 1530 ± 3 days and a mass of 0.75 ± 0.06 M⊙ for the tertiary component.

We present the results of deep radio observations of seven nearby large galaxies observed using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) 0.3–0.5 GHz receivers with an angular resolution of ∼10″. The achieved sensitivities of these observations range from ≈15 to 50 μJy beam−1, which is a factor of ≈3–4 lower than the previous observations at these frequencies. For two galaxies (NGC 3344 and NGC 3627) with moderate inclination angles, significant diffuse emissions are seen for the first time. The detected radio halos in the vertical direction are significantly larger in our 0.4 GHz maps compared to the observations at ∼1.5 GHz for four nearly edge-on galaxies—NGC 3623, NGC 4096, NGC 4594, and NGC 4631. For these four galaxies, significantly larger halos are also detected along the galaxy disk. For NGC 3623 and NGC 4594, we could detect elongated radio disks that were not seen before. We also present new uGMRT images of NGC 3344 and NGC 3623 at 1.3 GHz and a new VLA image of NGC 3627 at 1.5 GHz. We fitted an exponential function to the flux densities along different cross-cuts and found a significantly wider distribution at the 0.4 GHz uGMRT images compared to the high-frequency images at ∼1.5 GHz. Using maps at 0.144, 0.4, and ∼1.5 GHz, we made spectral index maps of the seven sample galaxies and found a steepening of the spectrum up to a value of ∼−1.5 in the halo regions of the galaxies.

Besides a dense coverage of their high latitudes by starspots, rapidly rotating cool stars also display low-latitude spots in Doppler images, although generally with lower coverage. In contrast, flux emergence models of fast-rotating stars predict strong poleward deflection of radially rising magnetic flux as the Coriolis effect dominates over buoyancy, leaving a spot-free band around the equator. To resolve this discrepancy, we consider a flux tube near the base of the convection zone in a solar-type star rotating 8 times faster than the Sun, assuming field intensification by weak-tube explosions. For the intensification to continue into the buoyancy-dominated regime, the upper convection zone must have a significantly steeper temperature gradient than in the Sun by a factor that is comparable with that found in 3D simulations of rotating convection. Within the hypothesis that stellar active regions stem from the base of the convection zone, flux emergence between the equator and 20° latitudes requires highly supercritical field strengths of up to 500 kG in rapidly rotating stars. These field strengths require explosions of 100 kG tubes within the convection zone, compatible with reasonable values of the superadiabatic temperature gradient associated with the more rapid rotation.

We study spectra produced by weakly accreting black hole (BH) systems using the semianalytic advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model and the general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation. We find significant differences between these two approaches related to a wider spread of the flow parameters as well as a much steeper radial distribution of the magnetic field in the latter. We apply these spectral models to the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of the nucleus of the M87 galaxy. The standard (in particular, 1D) formulation of the ADAF model does not allow us to explain it; previous claims that this model reproduces the observed SED suffer from an inaccurate treatment of the Compton process. The spectra based on GRMHD simulation are in a much better agreement with the observed data. In our GRMHD model, in which we assumed the BH spin a = 0.9, the bulk of radiation observed between the millimeter and the X-ray range is produced in the disk area within 4 gravitational radii from the BH. In this solution, the synchrotron component easily reproduces the spectral data between the millimeter and the UV range, and the Compton component does not violate the X-rays constraints, for yr−1 and a relatively strong magnetic field, with the plasma β ∼ 1 in the region where radiation is produced. However, the Compton component cannot explain the observed X-ray spectrum. Instead, the X-ray spectrum can be reproduced by a high-energy tail of the synchrotron spectrum if electrons have a hybrid energy distribution with a ∼5% nonthermal component.

<div> LOFAR, M31, supernova remnants, radio spectral indices, interstellar medium
<br /><br />总结:
本研究利用LOFAR在150 MHz频率下对M31中心进行了观测，并清晰地探测到了三个超新星遗迹。通过对这些遗迹的表征，包括与其他射电和X射线数据的比较，我们得出了它们的详细特征。另外，我们还对历史上的SN 1885A进行了上限估算，发现即使在低频率的150 MHz下也未探测到。分析模型表明，SN 1885A将至少在未来几个世纪内保持自由膨胀阶段。我们还对SN 1885A的星际介质密度进行了估算，结果显示介质密度不大于0.04 cm−3，并且超新星喷发密度的分布不会比∝r−9（平均值）更浅。此外，我们在X射线观测中发现了2.6σ的临时探测，分析结果表明非热辐射预计将主导SN 1885A的辐射。通过与G1.9+0.3的比较，我们发现G1.9+0.3的不对称性使得其比SN 1885A更有效地产生射电和X射线辐射。对于该地区的其他遗迹Braun 80、95和101，我们估计它们的年龄分别为5200、8100和13,100年，并且冲击速度分别为1150、880和660 km s−1。基于这些结果，我们推测M31中心0.5 kpc × 0.6 kpc区域的超新星速率至少为约3000年一次。最后，我们对遗迹的射电谱指数进行了估计，结果分别为−0.66 ± 0.05、−0.37 ± 0.03和−0.50 ± 0.03，与先前研究相当吻合。 <div>
We present the first LOFAR image of the center of M31 at a frequency of 150 MHz. We clearly detect three supernova remnants, which, along with archival VLA data at 3 GHz and other published radio and X-ray data, allows us to characterize them in detail. Our observations also allow us to obtain upper limits of the historical SN 1885A, which is undetected even at a low frequency of 150 MHz. From analytical modeling, we find that SN 1885A will stay in its free-expansion phase for at least another couple of centuries. We find an upper limit of nH ≲ 0.04 cm−3 for the interstellar medium of SN 1885A, and that the SN ejecta density is not shallower than ∝r−9 (on average). From the 2.6σ tentative detection in X-ray, our analysis shows that nonthermal emission is expected to dominate the SN 1885A emission. Comparing our results with those on G1.9+0.3, we find that it is likely that the asymmetries in G1.9+0.3 make it a more efficient radio and X-ray emitter than SN 1885A. For Braun 80, 95, and 101, the other remnants in this region, we estimate ages of 5200, 8100, and 13,100 yr, and shock speeds of 1150, 880, and 660 km s−1, respectively. Based on this, the supernova rate in the central 0.5 kpc × 0.6 kpc of M31 is at least one per ∼3000 yr. We estimate radio spectral indices of −0.66 ± 0.05, −0.37 ± 0.03, and −0.50 ± 0.03 for the remnants, respectively, which match fairly well with previous studies.

Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are sensitive to low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs), which induce correlated changes in millisecond pulsars’ timing residuals. PTA collaborations around the world have recently announced evidence of a nanohertz gravitational wave background (GWB), which may be produced by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). The GWB is often modeled as following a power-law power spectral density (PSD); however, a GWB produced by a cosmological population of SMBHBs is expected to have a more complex power spectrum due to the discrete nature of the sources. In this paper, we investigate using a t-process PSD to model the GWB, which allows us to fit for both the underlying power-law amplitude and spectral index as well as deviations from that power law, which may be produced by individual nearby binaries. We create simulated data sets based on the properties of the NANOGrav 15 yr data set, and we demonstrate that the t-process PSD can accurately recover the PSD when deviations from a power law are present. With longer timed data sets and more pulsars, we expect the sensitivity of our PTAs to improve, which will allow us to precisely measure the PSD of the GWB and study the sources producing it.

The measurement of continuum time lags in lensed quasars can effectively probe the accretion physics of quasars. This is because microlensing observations of lensed quasars can provide constraints on the half-light radii of quasar accretion disks. By combining the microlensing results with time lag measurements, one can, for the first time, estimate the propagation velocity of the physical process that drives interband time lags and cross correlations among disk emission (i.e., in UV/optical bands). In this study, we perform the disk reverberation mapping study for the well-studied lensed quasar, Q0957+561. The cross correlation between the Zwicky Transient Facility g and r bands was measured; the g variations lead the r ones by 6.4 ± 2.6 days in the rest frame. In combination with the half-light radius from the existing literature, we find that the propagation velocity of the variability mechanism should be times the speed of light. We discuss the possible outcomes of this result. Similar studies can be applied to other lensed quasars by utilizing the Legacy Survey of Space and Time observations.

Magnetic braking (MB) plays an important role in driving the evolution of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). The modified MB prescription, the convection and rotation boosted (CARB) model, is very successful in reproducing the detected mass-transfer rates of persistent neutron star (NS) LMXBs. In this work, we investigate whether the CARB MB prescription could account for the formation and evolution of some NS and black hole (BH) LMXBs with an observed orbital-period derivative. Using the MESA code, we perform a detailed binary evolution model for six NS and three BH LMXBs. Our simulations find that the CARB MB prescription can successfully reproduce the observed donor-star masses, orbital periods, and period derivatives of four NS LMXBs and one BH LMXB. Our calculated effective temperatures are in good agreement with the detected spectral types of two NS LMXBs and one BH LMXB. However, the standard MB model makes it difficult to produce the observed period derivatives of those LMXBs experiencing a rapid orbital shrinkage or expansion.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The electromagnetic field is a fundamental force in nature that regulates the formation of stars in the Universe. Despite decades of efforts, a reliable assessment of the importance of the magnetic fields in star formation relations remains missing. In star formation research, our acknowledgment of the importance of magnetic fields is best summarized by the R. M. Crutcher et al. B–ρ relation, whose interpretation remains controversial. The relation is either interpreted as proof of the importance of a magnetic field in gravitational collapse or as the result of self-similar collapse where the role of the magnetic field is secondary to gravity. Using simulations, we find a fundamental relation, –kB−ρ (the slope of the B–ρ relation): This fundamental B–ρ slope relation enables one to measure the Alfvénic Mach number, a direct indicator of the importance of the magnetic field, using the distribution of data in the B–ρ plane. It allows us to apply the following empirical B–ρ relation: which offers an excellent fit to the Crutcher et al. data, where we assume an relation ( ). The foundational relation provides an independent way to measure the importance of the magnetic field against the kinematic motion using multiple magnetic-field measurements. Our approach offers a new interpretation of the classical B–ρ relation, where a gradual decrease in the importance of B at higher densities is implied.

<title>Model-independent Calibration for Sound Horizon: Combining Observations of Supernovae and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation Measurements</title>

The sound horizon scale is a key theoretical prediction of the cosmological model that depends on the speed of sound in the baryon-photon fluid and the rate of expansion of the early Universe, before matter and radiation decoupled. Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) offer the direct measurement of this important scale imprinted in the distribution of galaxies. We propose a new model-independent method to calibrate the sound horizon (relative standard ruler) by using the latest observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and 2D BAO measurements. The final result is Mpc h−1 in the framework of the Pantheon SN Ia data set. This result changes to Mpc h−1 when the Pantheon+ data set is used. To highlight our analysis and results, we also use BAO DESI measurements and obtain the best-fitting value Mpc h−1. Note that even without an estimate of the dimensionless Hubble constant h, the combination of 2D BAO and SN Ia data sets already constrains the low-redshift standard ruler scale at the ∼1.26% level (at the ∼1.00% level in the framework of BAO DESI data set). More importantly, it is interesting to note that most of the obtained at high redshifts have systematically larger values: 9 out of 15 results are larger than the result obtained by combining all 2D BAOs. This finding may give us a better understanding of the discordance between the data sets, shed light on the Hubble tension, or reveal the need for new physics beyond the standard cosmological model.

We investigated two consecutive solar eruption events in the solar active region 12994 at the solar eastern limb on 2022 April 15. We found that the flare loops formed by the first eruption were involved in the second eruption. During the initial stage of the second flare, the middle part of these flare loops (E-loops) erupted outward along with the flux ropes below, while the parts of the flare loops (I-loops1 and I-loops2) on either side of the E-loops first rose and then contracted. Approximately 1 hr after the eruption, the heights of I-loops1 and I-loops2 decreased by 9 Mm and 45 Mm, respectively, compared to before the eruption. Their maximum descent velocities were 30 km s−1 and 130 km s−1, respectively. The differential emission measure results indicate that the plasma above I-loops1 and I-loops2 began to be heated about 23 minutes and 44 minutes after the start of the second flare, respectively. Within ∼20 minutes, the plasma temperature in these regions increased from ∼3 MK to ∼6 MK. We proposed an adiabatic heating mechanism where magnetic energy would be converted into thermal and kinetic energy when the prestretched loops contract. Our calculations show that the magnetic energy required to heat the two high-temperature regions are 1029–1030 erg, which correspond to a loss of field strength of 2–3 G.

<title>A Promising Approach for Determining Neutrino Mass Hierarchy by Using Supernova Neutrino Detections</title>

The determination of neutrino mass hierarchy is crucial for particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. In this work, we propose an easy-to-use method to determine the neutrino hierarchy based on core-collapse supernova (CCSN) neutrino detections. By analyzing the expected event rates of the neutrino burst at a terrestrial water Cherenkov detector, we found that the event rates predicted by the normal and inverted hierarchy models have marked differences in the neutrino energy range 10 ∼ 20 MeV and the postbounce time <0.5 s. Within this specific energy and time range, the analytical relationship between the cumulative event number and proto–neutron star (PNS) baryon mass is extracted. Based on the normal and inverted hierarchy models, two different PNS masses can be inferred from this relationship by using the time profile of neutrino events. Then, the neutrino hierarchy can be determined by comparing the PNS mass inferred from the neutrino detections and the electromagnetic or gravitational-wave channels. Furthermore, the nonadiabatic part of the Mikheyev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein flavor conversions may also be quantified with this method, which would be very helpful for the studies of the explosion mechanism and nucleosynthesis of CCSNe.

<title>Revealing the Elusive Companion of the Red Giant Binary 2MASS J05215658+4359220 from UV HST and Astrosat/UVIT Data</title>

Black hole (BH) demographics in different environments is critical in view of recent results on massive star binarity, and of the multimessenger detectability of compact object mergers. But the identification and characterization of noninteracting BHs are elusive, especially in the sparse field stellar population. A candidate noninteractive BH + red giant (RG) binary system, 2MASS J05215658+4359220, was identified by T. A. Thompson et al. We obtained Astrosat/UVIT far-ultraviolet (FUV) imaging and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UV−optical imaging and spectroscopy of the source to test possible scenarios for the optically elusive companion. HST/STIS spectra from ≈1600 to 10230 Å are best fit by the combination of two stellar sources, a RG with Teff = 4250 ± 150 K, log g = 2.0, RRG ∼ 27.8 R⊙ (assuming a single-temperature atmosphere), and a subgiant companion with Teff = 6000 K, Rcomp = 2.7 R⊙, or Teff = 5270 K, Rcomp = 4.2 R⊙ using models with one-tenth or one-third solar metallicity, respectively, log g = 3.0, extinction EB−V = 0.50 ± 0.2, adopting the Data Release 3 Gaia distance D = 2463 ± 120 pc. No FUV data existed prior to our programs. STIS spectra give an upper limit of 10−17 erg cm−2 s−1 Å−1 shortwards of 2300 Å; an upper limit of ≳25.7 ABmag was obtained in two UVIT FUV broad bands. The nondetection of FUV flux rules out a compact companion such as a hot white dwarf. The STIS spectrum shows strong Mg iiλ2800 Å emission, typical of chromospherically active RGs. The masses inferred by comparison with evolutionary tracks, ∼1M⊙ for the RG and between 1.1 and 1.6 M⊙ for the subgiant companion, suggest past mass transfer, although the RG currently does not fill its Roche lobe. WFC3 imaging in F218W, F275W, F336W, F475W, and F606W shows an unresolved source in all filters.

<div> Gaia DR3 data, rotation curve, mass distribution, NFW model, DMD model
<br /><br />总结:
最近的研究使用了银河系的旋转曲线来研究银河系的潜力和质量分布。通过假设银河系处于杰恩斯平衡状态，他们推导出了径向距离和垂直高度范围内的旋转曲线，并使用两种不同的质量模型来约束物质分布。他们发现，DMD模型比NFW模型更好地拟合了旋转曲线上的行为，并提到研究垂直高度不同位置的旋转曲线可以更好地约束暗物质分布的几何特性。 <div>
The circular velocity curve traced by stars provides a direct means of investigating the potential and mass distribution of the Milky Way. Recent measurements of the Galaxy’s rotation curve have revealed a significant decrease in velocity for Galactic radii larger than approximately 15 kpc. While these determinations have primarily focused on the Galactic plane, the Gaia DR3 data also offer information about off-plane velocity components. By assuming the Milky Way is in a state of Jeans equilibrium, we derived the generalized rotation curve for radial distances spanning from 8.5 kpc to 25 kpc and vertical heights ranging from −2 kpc to 2 kpc. These measurements were employed to constrain the matter distribution using two distinct mass models. The first is the canonical Navarro–Frenk–White (NFW) halo model, while the second, the dark matter disk (DMD) model, posits that dark matter is confined to the Galactic plane and follows the distribution of neutral hydrogen. The best-fitting NFW model yields a virial mass of Mvir = (6.5 ± 0.5) × 1011 M⊙, whereas the DMD model indicates a total mass of MDMD = (1.7 ± 0.2) × 1011 M⊙. Our findings indicate that the DMD model generally shows a better fit to both the on-plane and off-plane behaviors at large radial distances of the generalized rotation curves than the NFW model. We emphasize that studying the generalized rotation curves at different vertical heights has the potential to provide better constraints on the geometrical properties of the dark matter distribution.

这篇文章总结了对M83星系进行的12CO (1–0)观测数据的分析结果。研究采用Atacama大型毫米/亚毫米阵列进行观测，发现星系内约5724个分子云团，其中60%的CO亮度来自质量大于10^6M⊙的云团。质量大的云团集中在星系的臂、杆和中心区域，而较小的云团更多分布在星系的臂间区域。研究还发现，云团的亮度温度与Solomon等人于1987年确定的标度关系相符，但在数量上占主导地位的亮度温度低于2K的云团明显偏离这一关系。在考虑波束展宽效应后，大部分云团的动力学参数和表面质量密度可以用内在表面质量密度约为100M⊙pc-2和动力学参数约为1来解释，这与S87的观测结果相似。这些结果对于理解M83星系内的分子云团的物理特性具有重要意义。 <br /><br />总结: 该研究通过ALMA对M83星系的12CO观测数据进行分析，发现星系内分子云团的分布特性和物理参数，以及与标度关系的关联，这有助于深入理解星系内分子云团的性质。 <div>
We present a catalog of clouds identified from the 12CO (1–0) data of M83, which was observed using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array with a spatial resolution of ∼46 pc and a mass sensitivity of ∼104M⊙ (3σ). The almost full-disk coverage and high sensitivity of the data allowed us to sample 5724 molecular clouds with a median mass of ∼1.9 × 105M⊙, which is comparable to the most frequently sampled mass of giant molecular clouds by surveys in the Milky Way (MW). About 60% of the total CO luminosity in M83's disk arises from clouds more massive than 106M⊙. Such massive clouds comprise 16% of the total clouds in number and tend to concentrate toward the arm, bar, and center, while smaller clouds are more prevalent in interarm regions. Most >106M⊙ clouds have peak brightness temperatures Tpeak above 2 K with the current resolution. Comparing the observed cloud properties with the scaling relations determined by P. M. Solomon et al. (1987, hereafter S87), Tpeak > 2 K clouds follow the relations, but Tpeak < 2 K clouds, which are dominant in number, deviate significantly. Without considering the effect of beam dilution, the deviations would suggest modestly high virial parameters (median αvir ∼ 2.7) and low surface mass densities (median Σ ∼ 22 M⊙ pc−2) for the entire cloud samples, which are similar to values found for the MW clouds by T. S. Rice et al. (2016) and M.-A Miville-Deschênes et al. (2017). However, once beam dilution is taken into account, the observed αvir and Σ for a majority of the clouds (mostly Tpeak <2 K) can be potentially explained with intrinsic Σ of ∼100 M⊙ pc−2 and αvir of ∼1, which are similar to the clouds of S87.

在这篇文章中，研究人员通过分析卫星星系在宿主暗物质晕中的丰度，探讨了星—暗质质量关系的低质量端（MH < 1011M⊙）。他们指出最近对局部星系群环境中卫星星系的分析未能充分建模卫星星系恒星质量函数中的散射主要源，即固定宿主暗物质质量下的增光历史的方差。研究人员提出了一种新的推断框架，不仅恰当考虑了晕—晕方差，而且自然地确定了宿主暗物质质量混合的量，这通常是未知的。他们使用半解析SatGen模型构建了与卫星环绕类星系调查第三版数据一致的模拟卫星星系群体。他们证明即使在最理想的情况下，晕—晕方差使得对星—暗质量关系的散射施加任何有意义的限制几乎是不可能的。甚至由100个宿主组成的卫星星系调查最多只能在95%置信水平上对散射施加约0.5 dex的上限。这是因为晕组装历史的大方差主导了星—暗质量关系的散射。这个问题可以通过将调查样本大小增加一个数量级（大约1000个宿主星系）来解决，这在即将进行的光谱调查中应该是相当容易的。<br /><br />总结: 本文研究了卫星星系丰度与宿主暗物质晕的关系，并提出了一种新的推断框架来解决散射问题。研究人员发现即使在最理想的情况下，晕—晕方差也使得对星—暗质量关系的散射施加限制几乎不可能。他们指出，这个问题可以通过将调查样本大小增加一个数量级来解决。 <div>
The abundance of satellite galaxies is set by the hierarchical assembly of their host halo. We leverage this to investigate the low-mass end (MH < 1011M⊙) of the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR), which is key to constraining theories of galaxy formation and cosmology. We argue that recent analyses of satellite galaxies in the Local Group environment have not adequately modeled the dominant source of scatter in satellite stellar mass functions: the variance in accretion histories for a fixed host halo mass. We present a novel inference framework that not only properly accounts for this halo-to-halo variance but also naturally identifies the amount of host halo mass mixing, which is generally unknown. Specifically, we use the semianalytical SatGen model to construct mock satellite galaxy populations consistent with the third data release of the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs survey. We demonstrate that even under the most idealized circumstances, the halo-to-halo variance makes it virtually impossible to put any meaningful constraints on the scatter in the SHMR. Even a satellite galaxy survey made up 100 hosts can at best only place an upper limit of ∼0.5 dex on the scatter (at the 95% confidence level). This is because the large variance in halo assembly histories dominates over the scatter in the SHMR. This problem can be overcome by increasing the sample size of the survey by an order of magnitude (∼1000 host galaxies), something that should be fairly straightforward with forthcoming spectroscopic surveys.

这篇文章报道了对于高红移星系进行光谱分析的研究。研究中利用了482个确认的z=5.0−12.9的光谱观测数据，构建了代表高红移星系的光谱模板，并报告了它们的平均特性。研究发现在z=5−11的星系中，主要以蓝色紫外连续斜率为主，表明这些星系贫尘且年轻。在我们的样本中，还发现了57个Lyα发射星系，并与非发射星系进行比较。研究结果揭示了这两类星系之间的重要内在差异，对Lyα能见度有重要影响。这些光谱模板提供了一个新的观测基准，有助于解释高红移光源的全局特性，扩展到了宇宙的早期时期。 <div>
The exceptional spectra of the most luminous z > 10 sources observed so far have challenged our understanding of early galaxy evolution, requiring a new observational benchmark for meaningful interpretation. As such, we construct spectroscopic templates representative of high-redshift, star-forming populations, using 482 confirmed sources at z = 5.0−12.9 with JWST/NIRSpec prism observations, and report on their average properties. We find z = 5−11 galaxies are dominated by blue UV continuum slopes (β = −2.3 to −2.7) and reduced Balmer indices, characteristic of dust-poor and young systems, with a shift towards bluer slopes and younger ages with redshift. The evolution is mirrored by ubiquitous C iii] detections across all redshifts (rest-frame equivalent widths of 5−14 Å), which increase in strength towards early times. Rest-frame optical lines reveal elevated ratios (O32 = 7–31, R23 = 5–8, and Ne3O2 = 1−2) and subsolar metallicities (log(O/H) = 7.3−7.9), typical of ionization conditions and metallicities rarely observed in z ∼ 0 populations. Within our sample, we identify 57 Lyα emitters, which we stack and compare to a matched sample of nonemitters. The former are characterized by more extreme ionizing conditions with enhanced C iii], C iv, and He ii + [O iii] line emission, younger stellar populations from Balmer jumps, and a more pristine interstellar medium seen through bluer UV slopes and elevated rest-frame optical line ratios. The novel comparison illustrates important intrinsic differences between the two populations, with implications for Lyα visibility. The spectral templates derived here represent a new observational benchmark with which to interpret high-redshift sources, lifting our constraints on their global properties to unprecedented heights and extending out to the earliest of cosmic times.

<div> NEOs, nongravitational accelerations, linking apparitions, orbit identification algorithms, tracklets
<br /><br />总结:
最近在近地天体（NEOs）上发现了非引力加速，这引发了在近地环境中非均向质量损失的普遍性问题。研究表明，非引力加速度可能导致不同观测时刻的位置变化，并且影响了轨道识别算法的效果。然而，通过提出新的方法来寻找未链接的天体对，可以帮助识别和链接发生非引力加速的天体。当前的链接算法通常对非引力加速度具有一定的健壮性，但是可能会错过具有大非引力加速度的天体。预计从未来的调查任务中增加天体人口后，目前的算法将更加合适。 <div>
Nongravitational accelerations in the absence of observed activity have recently been identified on near-Earth objects (NEOs), opening the question of the prevalence of anisotropic mass loss in the near-Earth environment. Motivated by the necessity of nongravitational accelerations to identify 2010 VL65 and 2021 UA12 as a single object, we investigate the problem of linking separate apparitions in the presence of nongravitational perturbations. We find that nongravitational accelerations on the order of 1 × 10–9 au day−2 can lead to a change in plane-of-sky positions of ∼1 × 103 arcsec between apparitions. Moreover, we inject synthetic tracklets of hypothetical nongravitationally accelerating NEOs into the Minor Planet Center orbit identification algorithms. We find that at large nongravitational accelerations (∣Ai∣ ≥ 1 × 10−8 au day−2) these algorithms fail to link a significant fraction of these tracklets. We further show that if orbits can be determined for both apparitions, the tracklets will be linked regardless of nongravitational accelerations, although they may be linked to multiple objects. In order to aid in the identification and linkage of nongravitationally accelerating objects, we propose and test a new methodology to search for unlinked pairs. When applied to the current census of NEOs, we recover the previously identified case but identify no new linkages. We conclude that current linking algorithms are generally robust to nongravitational accelerations, but objects with large nongravitational accelerations may potentially be missed. While current algorithms are well-positioned for the anticipated increase in the census population from future survey missions, it may be possible to find objects with large nongravitational accelerations hidden in isolated tracklet pairs.

We present the second data release of the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2 (MaDCoWS2). We expand from the equatorial first data release to most of the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey area, covering a total area of 6498 deg2. The catalog consists of 133,036 signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) ≥ 5 galaxy cluster candidates at 0.1 ≤ z ≤ 2, including 6790 candidates at z > 1.5. We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify spurious detections and include CNN-based cluster probabilities in the final catalog. We also compare the MaDCoWS2 sample with literature catalogs in the same area. The larger sample provides robust results that are consistent with our first data release. At S/N ≥ 5, we rediscover 59%–91% of clusters in existing catalogs that lie in the unmasked area of MC2. The median positional offsets are under 250 kpc, and the standard deviation of the redshifts is 0.031(1 + z). We fit a redshift-dependent power law to the relation between MaDCoWS2 S/N and observables from existing catalogs. Over the redshift ranges where the surveys overlap with MaDCoWS2, the lowest scatter is found between S/N and observables from optical/infrared surveys. We also assess the performance of our method using a mock light cone measuring purity and completeness as a function of cluster mass. The purity is above 90%, and we estimate the 50% completeness threshold at a virial mass of log(M/M⊙) ≈ 14.3. The completeness estimate is uncertain due to the small number of massive halos in the light cone, but consistent with the recovery fraction found by comparing to other cluster catalogs.

A wide range of astrophysical sources exhibit extreme and rapidly varying electromagnetic emission indicative of efficient nonthermal particle acceleration. Understanding these sources often involves comparing data with a broad range of theoretical scenarios. To this end, it is beneficial to have tools that enable not only fast and efficient parametric investigation of the predictions of a specific scenario but also the flexibility to explore different theoretical ideas. In this paper, we introduce Tleco, a versatile and lightweight toolkit for developing numerical models of relativistic outflows, including their particle acceleration mechanisms and resultant electromagnetic signature. Built on the Rust programming language and wrapped into a Python library, Tleco offers efficient algorithms for evolving relativistic particle distributions and for solving the resulting emissions in a customizable fashion. Tleco uses a fully implicit discretization algorithm to solve the Fokker–Planck equation with user-defined diffusion, advection, cooling, injection, and escape and offers prescriptions for radiative emission and cooling. These include, but are not limited to, synchrotron, inverse-Compton, and self-synchrotron absorption. Tleco is designed to be user friendly and adaptable to model particle acceleration and the resulting electromagnetic spectrum and temporal variability in a wide variety of astrophysical scenarios, including, but not limited to, gamma-ray bursts, pulsar wind nebulae, and jets from active galactic nuclei. In this work, we outline the core algorithms and proceed to evaluate and demonstrate their effectiveness. The code is open source and available in the GitHub repository: https://github.com/zkdavis/Tleco.

<div> 关键词: exoplanet, carbon-rich atmosphere, puffy Venuses, magma oceans, TOI-561 b

总结:
本研究提出了一种名为“puffy Venuses”的理论类别的外行星模型，这些行星具有厚厚的碳主导大气，并处于与全球岩浆海洋相平衡的状态。研究模型考虑了大气和岩浆海洋之间的碳和氢分配，以及整个半灰色辐射对流大气中的碳-氢-氧平衡化学反应。研究发现，碳含量为1200 ppm（或普通球粒陨石的含量）可以使地球质量的行星在1500-2000 K的平衡温度下产生约0.16-0.3 R⊕的大气膨胀。研究指出TOI-561 b可能是一个特别有希望成为puffy Venus候选行星，其低密度可能归因于厚厚的碳富大气。此外，研究还提出了55 Cancri e可能具有puffy Venus解释，最近的JWST观测表明该行星可能具有CO/CO2大气。因此，puffy Venuses可能构成对低质量外行星内部结构的一种可检验的替代解释。 <div>
The recent advancements in exoplanet observations enable the potential detection of exo-Venuses, rocky planets with carbon-rich atmospheres. How extended these atmospheres can be, given high carbon abundances, has not been studied. To answer this, we present a model for a theoretical class of exoplanets—puffy Venuses—characterized by thick, carbon-dominated atmospheres in equilibrium with global magma oceans (MOs). Our model accounts for carbon and hydrogen partition between the atmosphere and the MO, as well as the C–H–O equilibrium chemistry throughout a semi-gray, radiative-convective atmosphere. We find that radius inflation by puffy Venus atmospheres is significant on small and irradiated planets: carbon content of 1200 ppm (or that of ordinary chondrites) can generate an atmosphere of ∼0.16–0.3 R⊕ for an Earth-mass planet with equilibrium temperatures of 1500–2000 K. We identify TOI-561 b as an especially promising puffy Venus candidate, whose underdensity could be attributed to a thick C-rich atmosphere. We also advocate for a puffy Venus interpretation of 55 Cancri e, where a recent JWST observation indicates the presence of a CO/CO2 atmosphere. Puffy Venuses may thus constitute a testable alternative interpretation for the interior structure of underdense low-mass exoplanets.

We investigate the kinematics and dynamics of the molecular and ionized gas in the host galaxies of three Palomar-Green quasars at low redshifts, benefiting from the archival millimeter-wave interferometric and optical integral field unit data. We study the kinematics of both cold molecular and hot ionized gas by analyzing the CO and Hα data cubes, and construct the mass distributions of our sample through gas dynamics, utilizing a priori knowledge regarding the galaxy light distribution. We find no systematic offset between the stellar mass derived from our dynamical method and that from the broadband photometry and mass-to-light ratio, suggesting the consistency of both methods. We then study the kinetic pressure and the weight of the interstellar medium (ISM) using our dynamical mass model. By studying the relationship between kinetic pressure and gravitational pressure of the quasar host galaxies, we find an equivalence in the hydrostatic equilibrium states of ISM in the quasar host galaxies, similar to the result of gas equilibrium in normal star-forming galaxies, suggesting minimal quasar feedback. Regarding noncircular motion as indicative of quasar-driven outflows, we observe an exceptionally low coupling efficiency between molecular gas outflow and active galactic nucleus bolometric luminosities. These results demonstrate the marginal influence of the central engine on the properties of cold molecular gas in quasar host galaxies.

We introduce Disk2Planet, a machine-learning-based tool to infer key parameters in disk–planet systems from observed protoplanetary disk structures. Disk2Planet takes as input the disk structures in the form of 2D density and velocity maps, and outputs disk and planet properties, that is, the Shakura–Sunyaev viscosity, the disk aspect ratio, the planet–star mass ratio, and the planet’s radius and azimuth. We integrate the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy, an evolutionary algorithm tailored for complex optimization problems, and the Protoplanetary Disk Operator Network, a neural network designed to predict solutions of disk–planet interactions. Our tool is fully automated and can retrieve parameters in one system in 3 minutes on an Nvidia A100 graphics processing unit. We empirically demonstrate that our tool achieves percent-level or higher accuracy, and is able to handle missing data and unknown levels of noise.

<div> 重复快速无线电爆发（FRBs），持久射电源（PRSs），CHIME/FRB重复器，多波段分析，星际中心引擎
<br /><br />总结:
这篇文章对37个CHIME/FRB重复器进行了系统性的射电源搜索，通过多波段分析，确认了两个潜在的持久射电源（20181030A-S1和20190417A-S1），但在绝大多数情况下并未找到相关的持久射电源。文章进一步提出了对与重复FRB相关的亮度低的持久射电源数量的限制。此外，该研究还对PRS候选者的来源进行了分析，并提出了未来观测的需求。 <div>
The identification of persistent radio sources (PRSs) coincident with two repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) supports FRB theories requiring a compact central engine. However, deep nondetections in other cases highlight the diversity of repeating FRBs and their local environments. Here, we perform a systematic search for radio sources towards 37 CHIME/FRB repeaters using their arcminute localizations and a combination of archival surveys and targeted observations. Through multiwavelength analysis of individual radio sources, we identify two (20181030A-S1 and 20190417A-S1) for which we disfavor an origin of either star formation or an active galactic nucleus in their host galaxies and thus consider them candidate PRSs. We do not find any associated PRSs for the majority of the repeating FRBs in our sample. For eight FRB fields with Very Large Array imaging, we provide deep limits on the presence of PRSs that are 2–4 orders of magnitude fainter than the PRS associated with FRB 20121102A. Using Very Large Array Sky Survey imaging of all 37 fields, we constrain the rate of luminous (≳1040 erg s−1) PRSs associated with repeating FRBs to be low. Within the context of FRB-PRS models, we find that 20181030A-S1 and 20190417A-S1 can be reasonably explained within the context of magnetar, hypernebulae, gamma-ray burst afterglow, or supernova ejecta models—although we note that both sources follow the radio luminosity versus rotation measure relationship predicted in the nebula model framework. Future observations will be required to both further characterize and confirm the association of these PRS candidates with the FRBs.

<title>Expanding the Inventory of Molecule-rich Planetary Nebulae: New Observations of M4-17, Hu 1-1, M1-59, and Na 2</title>

HNC, CCH, and CN are prevalent molecules in the four planetary nebulae, with fractional abundances of f ∼ 0.9–7.5 × 10−7. Elliptical PNe like Hu 1-1 have a diverse molecular composition, while the late PN stage Na 2 also contains CN, CCH, and HCO+ with comparable abundances to younger PNe, indicating the maintenance of molecular content. The study suggests that elliptical PNe can have a diverse molecular composition and demonstrates the presence of distinct molecular species in the late PN stage.<br /><br />总结:<br />本研究观察了M4-17、Hu 1-1、M1-59和Na 2四个行星状星云的分子情况，并发现了丰富的分子成分。其中CN、CCH和HCO+为主要分子，并且在各个行星状星云中的丰度相当。椭圆形行星状星云（如Hu 1-1）的分子组成多样，而晚期的Na 2也含有CN、CCH和HCO+，且与年轻的行星状星云相比丰度相似，表明分子成分在晚期行星状星云阶段得以保持。 <div>
Molecular observations of four planetary nebulae (PNe), M4-17, Hu 1-1, M1-59, and Na 2, were conducted at 1–3 mm using the Arizona Radio Observatory’s 12 m antenna and Submillimeter Telescope, and the Institut de Radioastronomie Millimétrique 30 m Telescope. Toward M4-17, HNC (J = 3 → 2), CCH (N = 2 → 1, N = 3 → 2), CN (N = 1 → 0, N = 2 → 1), H2CO (JKa,Kc = 21,2 → 11,1, JKa,Kc = 20,2 → 10,1, JKa,Kc = 21,1 → 11,0), CS (J = 3 → 2, J = 5 → 4), and H13CN (J = 2 → 1) were detected. An almost identical set of transitions was identified toward Hu 1-1. Moreover, c–C3H2 was detected in Hu 1-1 via three 2 mm lines: JKa,Kc = 31,2 → 22,1, JKa,Kc = 41,4 → 30,3, and JKa,Kc = 32, 2 → 21,1. HNC, CCH, CN, CS, and H13CN were found in M1-59, as well as H2S via its JKa,Kc = 11,0 → 10,1 line—the first detection of this key sulfur species in PNe. In addition, CCH and CN were identified in the 27,000 yr old Na 2. Among these four sources, CN and CCH were the most prevalent molecules (after CO and H2) with fractional abundances, relative to H2, of f ∼ 0.9–7.5 × 10−7 and 0.8–7.5 × 10−7, respectively. CS and HNC have abundances in the range f ∼ 0.5–5 × 10−8, the latter resulting in HCN/HNC ∼ 3 across all three PNe. The unusual species H2CO, c–C3H2, and H2S had f ∼ 3–4 × 10−7, 10−8, and 6 × 10−8. This study suggests that elliptical PNe such as Hu 1-1 can have a diverse molecular composition. The presence of CN, CCH, and HCO+ in Na 2, with comparable abundances to younger PNe, demonstrates that molecular content is maintained into the late PN stage.

总结:
本研究对前主序星的磁能量驱动的最强星际耀斑进行了观测和分析。研究团队利用Chandra望远镜观测到了Orion星云中大量的耀斑现象。此外，还进行了多波段观测，并分析了2003年至2016年的数据，得出了以下结论：1.报道了多个目标星的恒星休眠和耀斑X射线特性，有助于进行多波段分析。2.首次报告了中等能量耀斑与恒星质量/大小（存在/不存在盘）之间的相关性（或缺乏相关性）。3.大多数前主序星都表现出轻微的长期基线变化，这表明了固有的磁力学周期的缺失或者长期观测对前主序星X射线的影响。4.得出结论，X射线超级耀斑是前主序星中普遍现象，这表明所有原行星盘和新生行星都会受到高能辐射的影响。 <br /><br /> <div>
The most powerful stellar flares driven by magnetic energy occur during the early pre-main-sequence (PMS) phase. The Orion Nebula represents the nearest region populated by young stars, showing the greatest number of flares accessible to a single pointing of Chandra. This study is part of a multi-observatory project to explore stellar surface magnetic fields (with the Hobby–Eberly Telescope Habitable-zone Planet Finder, HET-HPF), particle ejections (with the Very Long Baseline Array, VLBA), and disk ionization (with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, ALMA) immediately following the detection of PMS superflares with Chandra. In 2023 December, we successfully conducted such a multi-telescope campaign. Additionally, by analyzing Chandra data from 2003, 2012, and 2016, we examine the multi-epoch behavior of PMS X-ray emission related to PMS magnetic cyclic activity and ubiquitous versus sample-confined megaflaring. Our findings are as follows. (1) We report detailed stellar quiescent and flare X-ray properties for numerous HET/ALMA/VLBA targets, facilitating ongoing multiwavelength analyses. (2) For numerous moderately energetic flares, we report correlations (or lack thereof) between flare energies and stellar mass/size (presence/absence of disks) for the first time. The former is attributed to the correlation between convection-driven dynamo and stellar volume, while the latter suggests the operation of solar-type flare mechanisms in PMS stars. (3) We find that most PMS stars exhibit minor long-term baseline variations, indicating the absence of intrinsic magnetic dynamo cycles or observational mitigation of cycles by saturated PMS X-rays. (4) We conclude that X-ray megaflares are ubiquitous phenomena in PMS stars, which suggests that all protoplanetary disks and nascent planets are subject to violent high-energy emission and particle irradiation events.

Small-scale brightenings are ubiquitous, dynamic, and energetic phenomena found in the chromosphere. An advanced filter-detection algorithm applied to high-resolution observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph enables the detection of these brightenings close to the noise level. This algorithm also tracks the movement of these brightenings and extracts their characteristics. This work outlines the results of an in-depth analysis of a quiet-Sun data set including a comparison of a brighter domain—associated with a supergranular boundary—to the quiescent internetwork domains. Several characteristics of brightenings from both domains are extracted and analysed, providing a range of sizes, durations, brightness values, travel distances, and speeds. The “active” quiet-Sun events tend to travel shorter distances and at slower speeds across the plane of the sky than their “true” quiet-Sun counterparts. These results are consistent with the magnetic field model of supergranular photospheric structures and the magnetic canopy model of the chromosphere above. Spectroscopic analyses reveal that bright points demonstrate blueshift (as well as some bidirectionality) and that they may rise from the chromosphere into the transition region. We believe that these bright points are magnetic in nature, are likely the result of magnetic reconnection, and follow current sheets between magnetic field gradients, rather than travel along magnetic field lines themselves.

<div> 关键词: 太阳风等离子体，电子群分布，电子准热噪声，电子密度和温度，库仑参数

总结:<br />
本文研究了太阳风等离子体中的电子群分布，发现可以用一个由麦克斯韦分布的核心和基于kappa分布的晕带的电子群模型来描述。通过计算不同日心径距离下的电子准热噪声的功率谱，揭示了这种噪声在频谱上的特点和有效的德拜长度随模型参数变化的依赖性。研究结果表明，电子准热噪声谱包括低频段（f < fpt）的平台、总等离子体频率 fpt处的峰值以及高频段（f > fpt）的急剧下降部分。随着日心径距离的增加，噪声的峰值和平台水平不断下降，峰值的形状也会因为kappa指数的变化而改变。尽管模型参数可以变化，但在实际情况下，这些参数的变化对于平台水平的影响不大，而当参数接近实际情况时，平台只显示出单调变化。这些结果对于未来内太阳风区域的深空探测以及探测器的设计具有重要的参考价值。 <div>
The electron population in the solar wind plasma can be described with three different components: a core, a halo, and a magnetic field aligned strahl. The electron quasi-thermal noise (QTN) is investigated by using an electron population model consisting of a core with a Maxwellian distribution and a halo with a kappa distribution, based on the empirical equations for electron density and temperature and the index for the kappa halo. The power spectra of the electron QTN are calculated at different heliocentric radial distances from 10 to 200 Rs. The dependence of the QTN spectrum and effective Debye length on model parameters, including the ratio of the halo to the core for the density and temperature, the kappa index, and the antenna length, is further discussed. The results show that the electron QTN spectrum consists of a plateau in the low-frequency band f < fpt, a peak at the total plasma frequency fpt, and a rapidly decreasing part in the high-frequency band f > fpt. The QTN peak and plateau level continuously decrease as the radial distance increases, with the peak’s shape changing due to the variation of the kappa index. Although the model parameters are variable, the QTN plateau level presents less than an order of change with these parameters changing greatly, and only a monotonic change of the plateau is shown when the parameters are close to the practical situation. The results can provide a reference for future deep-space exploration in the inner heliosphere, and also for the design of detectors.

总结: 
本文研究了银河球状星团中的两类主要恒星，即原始恒星和污染恒星。研究发现，原始恒星比例与星团的质量呈负相关，而与污染恒星的质量呈强负相关。同时发现，对于给定的原始恒星比例，大麦哲伦星云中的星团比小麦哲伦星云中的星团更大，这与银河的外部和内部的行星族星团的表现相反。研究者提出了星团形成条件可能导致这种差异。最后，研究者对单一恒星族星团NGC 419和Rup 106是否形成为多星族星团提出了质疑。 <br /><br /> <div>
Galactic globular clusters contain two main groups of stars, the pristine or 1P stars, and the polluted or 2P stars. The pristine-star fraction in clusters, F1P, is a decreasing function of the cluster present-day mass, mprst. Paper I has introduced a model mapping the region of the (mprst, F1P) space occupied by clusters, with the cluster mass threshold for 2P-star formation a key building block. We now expand this model to the pristine-star fraction in dependence of the pristine- and polluted-population masses. A. P. Milone et al. found that F1P anticorrelates more tightly with the polluted-population present-day mass, m2P,prst, than with the cluster total mass, mprst. By contrast, F1P anticorrelates poorly with the pristine-population current mass, m1P,prst. We show the loose anticorrelation between F1P and m1P,prst to result from a roughly constant pristine-population mass in clusters as they start their long-term evolution in the Galactic tidal field. As for the tight anticorrelation between m2P,prst and F1P, it stems from the initially shallow relation between m2P and F1P. Clusters of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC, respectively) appear to behave unexpectedly with respect to each other. For a given F1P, LMC clusters are more massive than SMC clusters despite their enduring a stronger tidal field. This is opposite to how the Galactic outer- and inner-halo clusters behave. The explanation may lie in cluster formation conditions. Finally, we wonder whether the single-population clusters NGC 419 and Rup 106 formed as multiple-population clusters.

Dark matter (DM) bars that shadow stellar bars have been previously shown to form in idealized simulations of isolated disk galaxies, but have yet to be studied in a fully cosmological context. In this work, we analyze a population of disk galaxies within the TNG50 simulation to determine the characteristics of their dark bars. We estimate bar strength and orientation using both the in-plane Fourier A2 density moments and the quadrupolar coefficients of the spherical harmonic basis function expansions of the density. We additionally present two novel methods for measuring the bar pattern speed Ωp and rotation axis orientation using these coefficients, and apply them to one sample galaxy located in a TNG50 subbox. Consistent with isolated simulations, DM bars are shorter than their stellar counterparts and are 75% weaker in A2. DM bars dominate the shape of the inner halo potential and are apparent in the time series of quadrupolar coefficients. In our selected subbox galaxy, the stellar and dark bars remain co-aligned throughout the last 8 Gyr and have identical Ωp. Pattern speed Ωp evolves considerably over the last 8 Gyr, consistent with torques on the bars due to dynamical friction and gas accretion, and is seen to increase following a merger at tlb = 1.5 Gyr. Rather than remaining static in time, the bar rotation axis displays both precession and nutation possibly caused by torques outside the plane of rotation. We find that the shape of the stellar and DM mass distributions are tightly correlated with Ωp.

太阳任务对太阳等离子体组成的测量至关重要。然而，在确定太阳大气中第一电离势效应的大小方面，密度和温度不敏感的光谱诊断比率很少。本文评估了Fe viii 185.213 Å/Ne viii 770.428 Å强度比率，发现它对温度和密度相当不敏感，因此原则上可用于分析轨道上的EUV光谱。实验结果表明，该诊断方法可以提供准确的结果，并且在对太阳冠层各个地方的变化幅度内小于10%-14%。作者还将该诊断应用于2023年3月的协同观测，并展示了SPICE和EIS的组合可以测量每个地方的Fe/Ne FIP偏差。结果显示，主导极性和衰减极性之间的FIP偏差上升与Solar Orbiter/Solar Wind Analyser对Fe/O的原位测量大致一致。多空间器的协同观测虽然复杂，但这一诊断方法也在Solar-C/Extreme UltraViolet高吞吐量光谱望远镜的波段计划内。 <br /><br />总结: 太阳任务对太阳等离子体组成的测量至关重要。本文评估了Fe viii/Ne viii 强度比率，在温度和密度不敏感范围内有其实用性。实验结果表明该诊断方法准确性高，在协同观测中也能得到好的效果。研究还表明Fe/Ne FIP偏差存在差别，并能与其他测量技术相互印证。 <div>
Plasma composition measurements are a vital tool for the success of current and future solar missions, but density- and temperature-insensitive spectroscopic diagnostic ratios are sparse, and their underlying accuracy in determining the magnitude of the first ionization potential (FIP) effect in the solar atmosphere remains an open question. Here we assess the Fe viii 185.213 Å/Ne viii 770.428 Å intensity ratio that can be observed as a multispacecraft combination between Solar Orbiter/SPICE and Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS). We find that it is fairly insensitive to temperature and density in the range of log (T/K) = 5.65–6.05 and is therefore useful, in principle, for analyzing on-orbit EUV spectra. We also perform an empirical experiment, using Hinode/EIS measurements of coronal fan loop temperature distributions weighted by randomly generated FIP bias values, to show that our diagnostic method can provide accurate results as it recovers the input FIP bias to within 10%–14%. This is encouraging since it is smaller than the magnitude of variations seen throughout the solar corona. We apply the diagnostic to coordinated observations from 2023 March and show that the combination of SPICE and EIS allows measurements of the Fe/Ne FIP bias in the regions where the footpoints of the magnetic field connected to Solar Orbiter are predicted to be located. The results show an increase in FIP bias between the main leading polarity and the trailing decayed polarity that broadly agrees with Fe/O in situ measurements from Solar Orbiter/Solar Wind Analyser. Multispacecraft coordinated observations are complex, but this diagnostic also falls within the planned wavebands for Solar-C/Extreme UltraViolet high-throughput Spectroscopic Telescope.

质量对β的影响在亚晕中最为显著，而在晕内恒星中最弱。此外，β在中心区域受M200影响而向各向同性转化，这要归因于宇宙学的影响。<br />
此外，随着c200的增加，晕内恒星和暗物质的β也变得更趋向于径向。暗物质粒子比亚晕更趋向于径向。这些差异可以解释为亚晕在更径向的轨道上更易被剥离，贡献更多的恒星和暗物质。<br />
最后，研究给出了在rs<3rs范围内晕内恒星和暗物质β差异的拟合公式。 <div>
We investigate the mass (M200) and concentration (c200) dependencies of the velocity anisotropy (β) profiles for different components in the dark matter halo—including halo stars, dark matter, and subhalos—using systems from the IllustrisTNG simulations. Beyond a critical radius, β becomes more radial with the increase of M200, reflecting more prominent radial accretion around massive halos. The critical radius is r ∼ rs, 0.3 rs, and rs for halo stars, dark matter, and subhalos, with rs being the scale radius of the host halos. This dependence on M200 is the strongest for subhalos and the weakest for halo stars. In central regions, the β of halo stars and dark matter particles get more isotropic with the increase of M200 in TNG300 due to baryons. By contrast, the β of dark matter from the dark-matter-only TNG300-Dark run shows much weaker dependence on M200 within rs. Dark matter in TNG300 is slightly more isotropic than in TNG300-Dark at 0.2 rs < r < 10 rs and . Halo stars and dark matter also become more radial with the increase in c200, at fixed M200. Halo stars are more radial than the β profile of dark matter by approximately a constant beyond rs. Dark matter particles are more radial than subhalos. The differences can be understood, as subhalos on more radial orbits are more easily stripped, contributing more stars and dark matter to the diffuse components. We provide the fitting formula for the differences between the β of halo stars and dark matter at rs < r < 3 rs as for and as βstar − βDM = 0.328 for .

<div> 关键词: Kinetic Alfvén waves, ion cyclotron waves, solar wind heating, hybrid simulations, ion beam mode <br />
总结: 本研究使用混合模拟提出了一种新的太阳风等离子体中KAWs和平行ICWs的生成场景。结果显示，通过离子束模式触发，KAWs和平行ICWs的生成与初始背景质子β值呈反相关关系，其增长速率显著高于离子束模式。此外，这些触发的波动的饱和能量可与离子束模式相媲美。这一触发过程解释了KAWs和平行ICWs的起源以及它们在束流等离子体环境中共存的可信原因。<br /><br /> <div>
Kinetic Alfvén waves (KAWs) and ion cyclotron waves (ICWs) are believed to play a significant role in the solar wind heating and acceleration and are pervasive in space and astrophysical plasmas. However, the generation mechanism for the coexistence of both wave modes remains unclear. The present work proposes a novel generation scenario of KAWs and parallel ICWs in a homogeneous solar wind plasma using hybrid simulations. Our numerical study reveals that the emissions of KAWs and parallel ICWs can be triggered by the ion beam (IB) mode in a homogeneous alpha or proton beam plasma with a beam velocity of ≥1.2vA for alpha particles or ≥1.6vA for proton beams, where vA represents the local Alfvén velocity. The growth rates of both KAWs and parallel ICWs are significantly higher than that of the IB mode. Moreover, the initial background proton beta exhibits an inverse correlation with the growth of KAWs. Ultimately, the saturation energy of these triggered emissions could rival that of the IB mode. Given the prevalent occurrence of IBs in the solar wind, this triggering process provides a credible explanation for the origin of KAWs and parallel ICWs and their coexistence within the beam plasma environments.

该研究使用了多个航天器的观测和数值模拟，以研究2021年12月4日的CME事件及其旋转情况。研究发现，CME在太阳日冕内部呈现近似直线运动，但在星际空间中出现逐渐改变轴向和旋转的情况。CME的不同部分受到不同速度太阳风的影响，导致磁结构产生非对称位移，进而在星际空间发生旋转。此外，在CME的右侧存在一个共转互作用区，也会导致CME的方向发生变化和偏离轨道。这些结果为解释CME在太阳圈层内的运动和结构提供了新的见解。

The magnetic orientation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is of great importance to understand their space weather effects. Although plenty of evidence suggests that CMEs can undergo significant rotation during the early phases of evolution in the solar corona, there are few reports that CMEs rotate in the interplanetary space. In this work, we use multispacecraft observations and a numerical simulation starting from the lower corona close to the solar surface to understand the CME event on 2021 December 4, with an emphatic investigation of its rotation. This event is observed as a partial halo CME from the back side of the Sun by coronagraphs and reaches the BepiColombo spacecraft and the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN/Tianwen-1 as a magnetic flux-rope-like structure. The simulation discloses that in the solar corona the CME is approximately a translational motion, while the interplanetary propagation process evidences a gradual change of axis orientation of the CME’s flux-rope-like structure. It is also found that the downside and the right flank of the CME moves with the fast solar wind, and the upside does in the slow-speed stream. The different parts of the CME with different speeds generate the nonidentical displacements of its magnetic structure, resulting in the rotation of the CME in the interplanetary space. Furthermore, at the right flank of the CME exists a corotating interaction region, which makes the orientation of the CME alter and also deviates from its route due to the CME. These results provide new insight into interpreting CMEs’ dynamics and structures during their traveling through the heliosphere.

<div> 开普勒-7b，PICASO，大气散射，反射光，云层

总结:
开普勒-7b是一个热木星，其大气模型通过PICASO模拟了三种云层的反射光相位曲线。模拟结果显示，含有三种云凝结物种类以及低沉降效率（0.03-0.1）的模型与开普勒观测数据最匹配。然而，模拟的反射光强度约为开普勒观测数据的三分之一。因此，需要更好地理解区域输送、云层辐射反馈和颗粒散射特性，才能解释模型和观测反射光通量之间的差异。 <div>
Examining reflected light from exoplanets aids in our understanding of the scattering properties of their atmospheres and will be a primary task of future flagship space- and ground-based telescopes. We introduce an enhanced capability of Planetary Intensity Code for Atmospheric Scattering Observations (PICASO), an open-source radiative transfer model used for exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres, to produce reflected light phase curves from three-dimensional atmospheric models. Since PICASO is coupled to the cloud code Virga, we produce phase curves for different cloud condensate species and varying sedimentation efficiencies (fsed) and apply this new functionality to Kepler-7b, a hot Jupiter with phase curve measurements dominated by reflected starlight. We model three different cloud scenarios for Kepler-7b: MgSiO3 clouds only, Mg2SiO4 clouds only, and Mg2SiO4, Al2O3, and TiO2 clouds. All our Virga models reproduce the cloudy region west of the substellar point expected from previous studies, as well as clouds at high latitudes and near the eastern limb, which are primarily composed of magnesium silicates. Al2O3 and TiO2 clouds dominate near the substellar point. We then compare our modeled reflected light phase curves to Kepler observations and find that models with all three cloud condensate species and low sedimentation efficiencies (0.03–0.1) match best, though our reflected light phase curves show intensities approximately one-third of those observed by Kepler. We conclude that a better understanding of zonal transport, cloud radiative feedback, and particle scattering properties is needed to further explain the differences between the modeled and observed reflected light fluxes.

总结:
该研究提出了一个自洽的模型，用于解释来自冲击加热等离子体的热X射线辐射，该模型考虑了温度和电离非平衡条件。他们通过同时求解温度和电离的弛豫过程来计算每个元素的温度和电离态的时间演变。通过与nei模型的比较，发现nei模型低估了离子化时间尺度约30％。研究人员将该模型应用于SNR N132D的Chandra数据，提供了冲击波速度约800 km s-1的约束，与先前的光学研究结果一致。<br /><br /> <div>
X-ray observations of shock-heated plasmas, such as those found in supernova remnants (SNRs), often exhibit features of temperature and ionization nonequilibrium. For accurate interpretation of these observations, proper calculations of the equilibration processes are essential. Here, we present a self-consistent model of thermal X-ray emission from shock-heated plasmas that accounts for both temperature and ionization nonequilibrium conditions. For a given pair of shock velocity and initial electron-to-ion temperature ratio, the temporal evolution of the temperature and ionization state of each element was calculated by simultaneously solving the relaxation processes of temperature and ionization. The resulting thermal X-ray spectrum was synthesized by combining our model with the AtomDB spectral code. Comparison between our model and the nei model, a constant-temperature nonequilibrium ionization model available in the XSPEC software package, reveals a 30% underestimation of the ionization timescale in the nei model. We implemented our model in XSPEC to directly constrain the shock wave’s properties, such as the shock velocity and collisionless electron heating efficiency, from the thermal X-ray emission from postshock plasmas. We applied this model to archival Chandra data of the SNR N132D, providing a constraint on the shock velocity of ∼800 km s−1, in agreement with previous optical studies.

<div> 关键词: Type II supernova, SN 2023ufx, metal-poor, dwarf galaxy, shock-cooling phase
总结:
该研究观测了在低金属量（Zhost ∼ 0.1 Z⊙）矮星系（Mg = −13.39 ± 0.16 mag，rproj ∼ 1 kpc）外围爆发的Type II超新星（SN II）SN 2023ufx。该超新星可能是目前观测到的金属含量最低的SN II。爆发光度高，达到Mg ≈ −18.5 mag，且演化迅速。光度曲线显示有一个持续20天（shock-cooling phase）和一个持续19天（plateau）的阶段。整个光学厚相持续时间仅约55天，表明红超巨前体在爆发前的H外壳已经减少。早期光谱未显示狭窄发射特征，限制了爆发前的质量损失率。光谱缺乏明显的金属吸收特征，表明前体金属丰度≲0.1 Z⊙。模拟结果显示金属贫穷的SN II可能具有与附近金属丰富的SN II不同的性质。这些观测奠定了对早期宇宙中金属贫穷SN II的建模基础。 <div>
We present extensive observations of the Type II supernova (SN II) SN 2023ufx, which is likely the most metal-poor SN II observed to date. It exploded in the outskirts of a low-metallicity (Zhost ∼ 0.1 Z⊙) dwarf (Mg = −13.39 ± 0.16 mag, rproj ∼ 1 kpc) galaxy. The explosion is luminous, peaking at Mg ≈ −18.5 mag, and shows rapid evolution. The r-band (pseudobolometric) light curve has a shock-cooling phase lasting 20 (17) days followed by a 19 (23) day plateau. The entire optically thick phase lasts only ≈55 days following explosion, indicating that the red supergiant progenitor had a thinned H envelope prior to explosion. The early spectra obtained during the shock-cooling phase show no evidence for narrow emission features and limit the preexplosion mass-loss rate to M⊙ yr−1. The photospheric-phase spectra are devoid of prominent metal absorption features, indicating a progenitor metallicity of ≲0.1 Z⊙. The seminebular (∼60–130 days) spectra reveal weak Fe ii, but other metal species typically observed at these phases (Ti ii, Sc ii, and Ba ii) are conspicuously absent. The late-phase optical and near-infrared spectra also reveal broad (≈104 km s−1) double-peaked Hα, Pβ, and Pγ emission profiles suggestive of a fast outflow launched during the explosion. Outflows are typically attributed to rapidly rotating progenitors, which also prefer metal-poor environments. This is only the second SN II with ≲0.1 Z⊙ and both exhibit peculiar evolution, suggesting a sizable fraction of metal-poor SNe II have distinct properties compared to nearby metal-enriched SNe II. These observations lay the groundwork for modeling the metal-poor SNe II expected in the early Universe.

<div> Hubble Tension, Hubble constant, TRGB, Cepheid variables, JWST <br />
总结:<br />
本研究旨在解决哈勃张力问题，通过比较不同标准烛光方法测定的星系距离，发现I 波段的TRGB测量与Cepheids测量无显著差异。通过使用JWST观测结果作为几何锚点，提供了对HST测量方法的重要系统交叉检查。然而，由于样本量较小，目前还无法与HST样本竞争。 <div>
The Hubble Tension, a >5σ discrepancy between direct and indirect measurements of the Hubble constant (H0), has persisted for a decade and motivated intense scrutiny of the paths used to infer H0. Comparing independently derived distances for a set of galaxies with different standard candles, such as the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) and Cepheid variables, can test for systematics in the middle rung of the distance ladder. The I band is the preferred filter for measuring the TRGB due to constancy with color, a result of low sensitivity to population differences in age and metallicity supported by stellar models. We use James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations with the maser host NGC 4258 as our geometric anchor to measure I-band (F090W versus F090W − F150W) TRGB distances to eight hosts of 10 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) within 28 Mpc: NGC 1448, NGC 1559, NGC 2525, NGC 3370, NGC 3447, NGC 5584, NGC 5643, and NGC 5861. We compare these with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Cepheid-based relative distance moduli for the same galaxies and anchor. We find no evidence of a difference between their weighted means, 0.01 ± 0.04 (stat) ± 0.04 (sys) mag. We produce 14 variants of the TRGB analysis, altering the smoothing level and color range used to measure the tips to explore their impact. For some hosts, this changes the identification of the strongest peak, but this causes little change to the sample mean difference, producing a full range of 0.00–0.02 mag, all consistent at 1σ with no difference. The result matches past comparisons of I-band TRGB and Cepheids when both use HST. SNe and anchor samples observed with JWST are too small to yield a measure of H0 that is competitive with the HST sample of 42 SNe Ia and 4 anchors; however, they already provide a vital systematic cross-check to HST measurements of the distance ladder.

<div> 关键词: NGC 4151, 变化型活动星系核, 宽线区域, 时间滞后, 光度变化
总结:
NGC 4151是一个变化型活动星系核，通过四年的速度分辨重映射测量，确认了一个符合光电离模型预测的分层宽线区域结构。研究发现了一个“反呼吸”现象，即随着光度增加，宽谱线的时间滞后减小，与预期相反。此现象可能是由于紫外-光学滞后或宽线区域气体非维里化运动的影响。同时，速度分辨重映射和电离映射分析揭示了宽线区域几何形状和动力学的快速和显著变化，这些变化在不到一年的时间内发生，无法用任何单一机制解释。另外，NGC 4151和其他变化型活动星系核的Hβ滞后与低吸积率星系核的半径-光度关系一致，表明变化型活动星系核现象更可能是由内在吸积率的变化而不是遮挡所驱动。这些发现为理解变化型活动星系核的复杂内部过程提供了新的见解，并强调了长期、多线重映射对理解宽线区域结构、几何形状和动力学的重要性。 <div>
We present the results of a four-year velocity-resolved reverberation mapping (RM) campaign of the changing-look active galactic nucleus (CL-AGN) NGC 4151 during its outburst phase. By measuring the time lags of the Hα, Hβ, Hγ, He i, and He ii emission lines, we confirm a stratified broad-line region (BLR) structure that aligns with predictions from photoionization models. Intriguingly, we observed an “anti-breathing” phenomenon, where the lags of broad emission lines decreased with increasing luminosity, contrary to the typical expectation. This anomaly may be attributed to the influence of the ultraviolet-optical lag or nonvirialized motions in the BLR gas. Velocity-resolved RM and ionization mapping analyses revealed rapid and significant changes in the BLR geometry and kinematics on timescales of less than a year, which cannot be interpreted by any single mechanism, such as an inhomogeneous BLR, variations in radiation pressure, or changes in the illuminated ionizing field. Additionally, the Hβ lags of NGC 4151 and other CL-AGNs agree with the radius–luminosity relationship established for AGNs with low accretion rates, implying that the CL phenomenon is more likely driven by intrinsic changes in the accretion rate rather than obscuration. These findings provide new insights into the complex internal processes of CL-AGNs and highlight the importance of long-term, multiline RM for understanding BLR structures, geometry, and kinematics.

这篇研究提出了一个新的铁（Fe）和α元素（Ca，Mg，Ti，Si）的原子光谱线列表，用于改进利用近红外（NIR）光谱进行恒星参数确定。通过对太阳和其类似恒星HD 76151的高分辨率和高质量的近红外光谱进行验证，得出了HD 76151的有效温度、表面重力和金属丰度的数值。通过与PARSEC等时线模型的比较，确定了HD 76151的质量、半径和年龄。此外，使用Gaia天文和光谱数据进行了HD 76151的运动和动力学轨道分析，结果表明该恒星是太阳圆内一个金属丰富区域的成员。这一分析结果与光谱分析反映的恒星略微富金属的性质是一致的。 <div>
Determining the physical nature of a star requires precise knowledge of its stellar atmospheric parameters, including effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity. This study presents a new atomic line list covering a broad spectral range (1–2.5 μm; YJHK bands) for iron (Fe) and α-elements (Ca, Mg, Ti, Si) to improve stellar parameter determination using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. We highlight the limitations of existing line lists, stemming primarily from inconsistencies in oscillator strengths for ionized iron lines within the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment DR17. The line list was validated using the high-resolution and high-quality disk-center NIR spectra of the Sun and its solar analog HD 76151. As a result of the spectroscopic analyses, the effective temperature of HD 76151 was calculated as 5790 ± 170 K, surface gravity as 4.35 ± 0.18 cgs, metal abundance as 0.24 ± 0.09 dex, and microturbulence velocity of km s−1 by combining the optical and NIR line lists. A comparison of the model atmospheric parameters calculated for HD 76151 with the PARSEC isochrones resulted in a stellar mass of , radius , and an age of Gyr. For the first time, kinematic and dynamical orbital analyses of HD 76151 using a combination of Gaia astrometric and spectroscopic data showed that the star was born in a metal-rich region within the solar circle and is a member of the thin disk population. Thus, the slightly metal-rich nature of the star, as reflected in its spectroscopic analysis, was confirmed by dynamical orbital analysis.

总结: 
本文研究了伽马射线暴（GRB）的中微子发射机制以及探测前景。通过选择四个特殊的GRB事件，采用两种不同类型的射流组成，作者发现只有GRB 211211A事件可以通过耗散光球模型得到良好的约束。但对于内部碰撞诱导的磁重连接和湍流（ICMART）模型，对GRB 230307A和GRB 080916C无法有效约束。此外，作者还调查了来自GRB的高能中微子的探测前景，并发现即使在IceCube-Gen2操作期间，也很难从ICMART模型中探测到与GRB相关的高能中微子。然而，对于类似GRB 211211A的事件，在IceCube-Gen2操作期间，如果这样的事件来源于光球耗散内的紧凑恒星合并，可能会探测到与引力波同时发生的至少一个中微子。 <br /><br /> <div>
The prompt emission mechanism of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is a long-standing open question, and GRBs have been considered as potential sources of high-energy neutrinos. Despite many years of search for the neutrino events associated with GRBs from IceCube, there were no results. However, the absence of search results for neutrinos provides a unique opportunity to constrain the parameter space of GRB jet models. In this paper, we chose four peculiar GRBs with two different types of jet composition to investigate neutrino emission. It is found that only GRB 211211A could be well constrained within the dissipative photosphere model. By adopting the specific parameters of the photosphere, one can obtain εp/εe < 8 for fp > 0.2 from GRB 211211A. For the Internal-collision-induced Magnetic Reconnection and Turbulence (ICMART) model, we can effectively constrain neither GRB 230307A nor GRB 080916C. Moreover, we also investigate the detection prospects of high-energy neutrinos from GRBs and find that it is difficult to detect at least one high-energy neutrino associated with GRBs from the ICMART model even during the IceCube-Gen2 operation. For the GRB 211211A-like events, it is possible to detect at least one neutrino coincident with the gravitational wave during the IceCube-Gen2 operation, if such an event originated from mergers of compact stars within the photosphere dissipation.

总结:<br /><br />这篇论文研究了质子-回旋仪不稳定性并使用速度矩理论来分析物理过程。研究表明，速度矩理论在较为接近稳定状态时略微夸大了温度各向异性的放松，但仍然是有效的。同时，通过粒子-在-单元和混合码模拟结果的验证，论文证明了速度矩理论作为PC不稳定性的高效理论工具的合理性。 <div>
The proton-cyclotron (PC) instability operates in various space plasma environments. In the literature, the so-called velocity moment-based quasi-linear theory is employed to investigate the physical process of PC instability that takes place after the onset of early linear exponential growth. In this method, the proton velocity distribution function (VDF) is assumed to maintain a bi-Maxwellian form for all time, which substantially simplifies the analysis, but its validity has not been rigorously examined by comparing against the actual solution of the kinetic equation. The present paper relaxes the assumption of the velocity moment-based quasi-linear theory by actually solving for the velocity space diffusion equation under the assumption of separable perpendicular and parallel VDFs, and upon comparison with the simplified velocity moment theory, it demonstrates that the simplified method is largely valid, despite the fact that the method slightly overemphasizes the relaxation of temperature anisotropy when the system is close to the marginally stable state. The overall validation is further confirmed with the results of particle-in-cell and hybrid-code simulations. The present paper thus provides a justification for making use of the velocity moment-based quasi-linear theory as an efficient first-cut theoretical tool for the PC instability.

Boomerang星云是由能量充沛的脉冲星PSR J2229+6114提供动力的明亮射电和X射线脉冲星风星云（PWN）。在考虑电子的对流和扩散传输的情况下，利用PWN的动力学演化模型对其X射线辐射进行建模，发现星云内的磁场比较弱，这意味着通过注入的电子/正电子对的逆康普顿（IC）辐射可能对Boomerang星云的UHEγ射线产生显著贡献。我们还讨论了先前研究的结果，并讨论了PWN可能的强子UHE辐射。 在我们的模型中，脉冲星大部分的自转耗散功率可能转化为热粒子或相对论质子。 <div>
The Boomerang Nebula is a bright radio and X-ray pulsar wind nebula (PWN) powered by an energetic pulsar, PSR J2229+6114. It is spatially coincident with one of the brightest ultrahigh-energy (UHE; ≥100 TeV) gamma-ray sources, LHAASO J2226+6057. While X-ray observations have provided radial profiles for both the intensity and photon index of the nebula, previous theoretical studies have not reached an agreement on their physical interpretation, which also leads to different anticipation of the UHE emission from the nebula. In this work, we model its X-ray emission with a dynamical evolution model of PWN, considering both convective and diffusive transport of electrons. On the premise of fitting the X-ray intensity and photon index profiles, we find that the magnetic field within the Boomerang Nebula is weak (∼10 μG in the core region and diminishing to 1 μG at the periphery), which therefore implies a significant contribution to the UHE gamma-ray emission by the inverse Compton (IC) radiation of injected electron/positron pairs. Depending on the particle transport mechanism, the UHE gamma-ray flux contributed by the Boomerang Nebula via the IC radiation may constitute about 10%–50% of the flux of LHAASO J2226+6057 at 100 TeV and up to 30% at 500 TeV. Finally, we compare our results with previous studies and discuss potential hadronic UHE emission from the PWN. In our modeling, most of the spindown luminosity of the pulsar may be transformed into thermal particles or relativistic protons.

总结:<br /><br />
这篇文章研究了银河系周围的卫星星系的六维相空间信息，并使用该信息计算了这些卫星星系在银河系和大麦哲伦云的共同引力作用下的轨道历史。研究发现，在考虑了大麦哲伦云的引力以及其相关卫星星系的群体入射后，银河系的径向分布随时间变得更加集中。文章还指出，与近期对类似银河系的系统的调查相比，银河系的径向分布在目前和1至2亿年前都更加集中。此外，研究还发现，与银河系质量的模拟宿主相比，银河系的径向分布也更加集中。最后，文章推测，模拟银河系质量的类似系统在有大麦哲伦云伴星的情况下，其径向分布很可能会与研究结果相似，表明一个巨大卫星星系及其卫星的加入会导致更加集中的径向分布。 <div>
The Milky Way (MW) is surrounded by dozens of satellite galaxies, with six-dimensional (6D) phase-space information measured for over 80% of this population. The spatial distribution of these satellites is an essential probe of galaxy formation and for mapping the MW’s underlying dark matter distribution. Using measured 6D phase-space information of known MW satellites, we calculate orbital histories in a joint MW+LMC potential, including the gravitational influence of the LMC on all satellites and on the MW’s center of mass, and dynamical friction owing to both galaxies, to investigate the evolution of the MW’s cumulative radial profile. We conclude that radial profiles become more concentrated over time when we consider the LMC’s gravitational influence and the group infall of LMC-associated satellites. The MW’s radial distribution is consistently more concentrated at the present day and 1 and 2 Gyr ago compared to recent surveys of nearby MW-like systems. Compared to MW-mass hosts in cosmological, zoom-in simulations, we find the MW’s radial profile is also more concentrated than those of simulated counterparts; however, some overlap exists between simulation results and our analysis of the MW’s satellite distribution 2 Gyr ago, pre-LMC infall. Finally, we posit that radial profiles of simulated MW-mass analogs also hosting an LMC companion are likely to evolve similarly to our results, such that the accretion of a massive satellite along with its satellites will lead to a more concentrated radial profile as the massive satellite advances toward its host galaxy.

<br /><br />本研究利用Swift卫星2004年至2019年的高红移样本，假设z ≥ 2的长伽玛射线暴（GRBs）都是坍缩星GRBs，利用断裂幂律形式构建了光度函数，并考虑了无演化、光度演化和密度演化三种情景。研究结果如下：（1）无演化模型可以被排除；（2）拟合结果表明，要充分解释观测结果，需要在红移上要么有显著的光度（演化指数）要么密度（）演化。这排除了长GRB的红移演化是由非坍缩星GRB的污染引起；（3）光度演化模型预测，z < 2且P ≥ 1 ph cm−2 s−1的坍缩星GRB数量为138.6，占观测到的这类GRB数量的82.5%；密度演化模型预测，这一数量为80.2，占观测数量的47.7%。无论采用何种模型，都有相当一部分长GRB并非坍缩星GRB。
<br /><br />总结: 本研究利用Swift卫星观测得出，长伽玛射线暴（GRBs）在高红移下的演化具有显著特征，需要考虑光度或密度演化模型。根据光度演化模型预测，某种类型的长GRBs在z < 2且P ≥ 1 ph cm−2 s−1的数量占观测总数的82.5%，而密度演化模型预测为47.7%。同时也发现，无论采用何种模型，都有相当一部分长GRBs不是坍缩星GRB。 <div>
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are powerful probes of the high-redshift Universe. However, the proportion of collapsar GRBs among long GRBs and their event rate relative to the star formation rate (SFR) remain contentious issues. We assume that long GRBs with z ≥ 2 are all collapsar GRBs and construct the luminosity function using a high-redshift sample from the Swift satellite spanning 2004 to 2019. We model the luminosity function with a broken power-law form and consider three scenarios: no evolution, luminosity evolution, and density evolution. Our results are as follows: (1) The no-evolution model can be ruled out. (2) The fitting results indicate that to adequately explain the observations, a significant redshift evolution in either luminosity (evolution index ) or density ( ) is required. This excludes the possibility that the evolution of long GRBs with redshift is due to contamination from noncollapsar GRBs. (3) The luminosity evolution model predicts that the number of collapsar GRBs with z < 2 and P ≥ 1 ph cm−2 s−1 is 138.6, accounting for 82.5% of the observed long GRBs with z < 2 and P ≥ 1 ph cm−2 s−1. The density evolution model predicts that the number of collapsar GRBs with z < 2 and P ≥ 1 ph cm−2 s−1 is 80.2, accounting for 47.7% of the observation. Regardless of the model, a substantial portion of the long GRBs are not collapsar GRBs.

<title>The SPT-Chandra BCG Spectroscopic Survey. I. Evolution of the Entropy Threshold for ICM Cooling and AGN Feedback in Galaxy Clusters over the Last 10 Gyr</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present a multiwavelength study of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in a sample of the 95 most massive galaxy clusters selected from the South Pole Telescope Sunyaev–Zeldovich (SZ) survey. Our sample spans a redshift range of 0.3 < z < 1.7, and is complete with optical spectroscopy from various ground-based observatories, as well as ground and space-based imaging from optical, X-ray, and radio wave bands. At z ∼ 0, previous studies have shown a strong correlation between the presence of a low-entropy cool core and the presence of both star formation and radio-loud active galactic nuclei in the central BCG. We show for the first time that the central entropy threshold for triggering star formation, which is universally seen in nearby systems, persists out to z ∼ 1, with only marginal (∼1σ) evidence for evolution in the threshold entropy value itself. In contrast, we do not find a similar high-z analog for an entropy threshold for feedback, but instead measure a strong evolution in the fraction of radio-loud BCGs in high-entropy cores, decreasing with increasing redshift. This could imply that the cooling-feedback loop was not as tight in the past, or that some other fuel source like mergers are fueling the radio sources more often with increasing redshift, making the radio luminosity an increasingly unreliable proxy for radio jet power. We also find that our SZ-based sample is missing a small (∼4%) population of the most luminous radio sources (νLν > 1042 erg s−1), likely due to radio contamination suppressing the SZ signal with which these clusters are detected.

<title>Probing the Morphology of Polarized Emission Induced by Fluctuation Dynamo Using Minkowski Functionals</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The morphology and the characteristic scale of polarized structures provide crucial insights into the mechanisms that drive turbulence and maintain magnetic fields in magneto-ionic plasma. We aim to establish the efficacy of Minkowski functionals as quantitative statistical probes of filamentary morphology of polarized synchrotron emission resulting from fluctuation dynamo action. Using synthetic observations generated from magnetohydrodynamic simulations of fluctuation dynamos with varying driving scales (ℓf) of turbulence in isothermal, incompressible, and subsonic media, we study the relation between different morphological measures and their connection to fractional polarization (pf). We find that Faraday depolarization at low frequencies gives rise to small-scale polarized structures that have higher filamentarity as compared to the intrinsic structures that are comparable to ℓf. Above ∼3 GHz, the number of connected polarized structures per unit area (NCC,peak) is related to the mean pf (〈pf〉) of the emitting region as , provided the scale of the detectable emitting region is larger than ℓf. This implies that NCC,peak represents the number of turbulent cells projected on the plane of the sky and can be directly used to infer ℓf via the relation . An estimate of ℓf thus directly allows for pinning down the turbulence-driving mechanism in astrophysical systems. While the simulated conditions are mostly prevalent in the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters, the qualitative morphological features are also applicable in the context of interstellar medium in galaxies.

Semianalytic models (SAMs) systematically predict higher-stellar mass scatter at a given halo mass than hydrodynamical simulations and most empirical models. Our goal is to investigate the physical origin of this scatter by exploring modifications to the physics in the SAM Dark Sage. We design two black hole formation models that approximate results from the IllustrisTNG 300-1 hydrodynamical simulation. In the first model, we assign a fixed black hole mass of 106M⊙ to every halo that reaches 1010.5M⊙. In the second model, we disregard any black hole growth as implemented in the standard Dark Sage model. Instead, we force all black hole masses to follow the median z = 0 black hole mass–halo mass relation in IllustrisTNG 300-1 with an imposed fixed scatter. We find that each model on its own does not significantly reduce the scatter in stellar mass. To explore the effects of active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback in addition to black hole seeding, we replace the native Dark Sage AGN feedback model with a simple model where we turn off cooling for galaxies with black hole masses above 108M⊙. With the additional modification in AGN feedback, we find that the supermassive black hole seeding and fixed conditional distribution models create a significant reduction in the scatter in stellar mass at halo masses between 1011–14M⊙. These results suggest that AGN feedback in SAMs acts in a qualitatively different way than feedback implemented in cosmological simulations. Either or both may require substantial modification to match the empirically inferred scatter in the stellar mass–halo mass relation.

The cosmic expansion rate can be directly measured with gravitational-wave (GW) data of the compact binary mergers by jointly constraining the mass function of the population and the cosmological model via the so-called spectral sirens. Such a method relies on the features in the mass functions, which may originate from some individual subpopulations and hence become blurred/indistinct due to the superposition of different subpopulations. In this work, we propose a novel approach to constrain the cosmic expansion rate with subpopulations of GW events, named multispectral sirens. The advantage of the multispectral sirens compared to the traditional spectral sirens is demonstrated by the simulation with the mock data. The application of this approach to the GWTC-3 data yields (median and symmetric 68.3% credible interval), which is about 19% tighter than the result inferred with the traditional spectral sirens utilizing a powerlaw+peak mass function. The incorporation of the bright standard siren GW170817 with a uniform prior in [10, 200] (log-uniform prior in [20,140]) Mpc−1 km s−1 gives (68.3% confidence level), corresponding to an improvement of ∼26% (23%) with respect to the measurement from sole GW170817.

β Pic运动星团成员η Tel A以及其棕矮星二进制伴星η Tel B的JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument（MIRI）Medium Resolution Spectrograph（MRS）观测结果显示，在PSF减法后，我们恢复了围绕η Tel A的碎片盘的空间分辨率流量，以及伴星的位置。我们呈现了碎片盘的新的5-26 μm光谱数据，其中我们发现了一个20 μm的硅酸盐特征，以及η Tel B的首个11-21 μm光谱，表明其为裸露的光球。我们得出了伴星的新的相对天体测量数据，将测量的基线延伸至25年，并发现它目前位于一个偏心的长周期轨道的远日点附近。伴星的轨道与碎片盘非常接近，它应该显著地扰动其中的行星体，结果会在中红外光谱中产生可检测的近日点发光，并且与伴星接近共面。然而，与预期相反，我们发现在MIRI MRS数据中，碎片盘似乎是轴对称的，并且可能与伴星不对齐。我们推测这可能是由于存在一个尚未发现的∼0.7-30 MJ行星，其轨道位于盘的内部，半长轴约为∼3-19 au。 <br /><br />总结: 
- 通过MIRI MRS观测发现了碎片盘的空间分辨率流量和伴星的光谱特征
- 得出了伴星的新的相对天体测量数据，展现其长周期轨道
- 预测伴星会扰动盘中的行星体，但实际观测表明盘是轴对称的，可能不与伴星对齐

We report JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) observations of the β Pic moving-group member, η Tel A, along with its brown dwarf binary companion, η Tel B. Following point-spread-function subtraction, we recover the spatially resolved flux from the debris disk around η Tel A, along with the position of the companion exterior to the disk. We present a new 5–26 μm epoch of spectroscopy for the disk, in which we discover a 20 μm silicate feature, and the first ever 11–21 μm spectrum of η Tel B, which indicates a bare photosphere. We derive a new epoch of relative astrometry for the companion, extending the baseline of measurements to 25 yr, and find that it is currently located near the apocenter of an eccentric long-period orbit. The companion’s orbit is close enough to the disk that it should significantly perturb the planetesimals within it, resulting in a detectable mid-IR pericenter glow and near alignment with the companion. Contrary to expectations, however, we find that the disk appears to be axisymmetric and potentially misaligned with the companion in the MIRI MRS data. We posit that this may be due to the presence of an additional, as-yet-undetected ∼0.7–30 MJ planet orbiting interior to the disk, with a semimajor axis of ∼3–19 au.

总结:
Godzilla是位于镜像的Sunburst星系的年轻超星团，动力驱动一个星际气体星云。通过使用哈勃空间望远镜的光度测量和非常大望远镜（VLT）MUSE和VLT/X-Shooter的光谱分析，研究人员得出了该星团和星云的物理和化学特性。他们发现Godzilla非常年轻，质量巨大，具有恒星金属丰度和紧凑的远紫外成分。星际气体富含氮和氦，表明存在恒星风物质，而氧的含量相对于恒星金属丰度高，表明有核心坍缩超新星喷发的痕迹。这导致了星团内的高密度和高压力环境。综合各种分析，他们推断星团和星云中的气体成分与恒星形成和超新星喷发的元素产生模型相吻合。 <div>
We suggest that “Godzilla” of the lensed Sunburst galaxy (z = 2.37) is a young super star cluster powering a nebula of gravitationally trapped stellar ejecta. Employing Hubble Space Telescope photometry and spectroscopy from the Very Large Telescope (VLT) MUSE and VLT/X-Shooter, we infer the physical and chemical properties of the cluster and nebula, finding that Godzilla is young, 4–6 Myr; massive, 2 × 106M⊙ (1000/μ); of stellar metallicity, Z ≃ 0.25 Z⊙; and has a compact far-UV component of ≲1 pc (1000/μ), where μ is the flux magnification factor. The gas is significantly enriched with N and He, indicating stellar wind material, and has highly elevated O relative to the stellar metallicity, indicating entrainment of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) ejecta. The high density, ne ≃ 107−8 cm−3, implies a highly pressurized intracluster environment. We propose that the pressure results from CCSN-driven supersonic turbulence in warm, self-shielding gas, which has accumulated in the cluster center after runaway radiative cooling and is dense enough to resist removal by CCSNe. The nebula gas shows subsolar C/O, Ne/O, and Si/O, which may reflect the CCSN element yields for initial stellar masses >40 M⊙. A comparison to element yield synthesis models for young star clusters shows that the gas abundances are consistent with complete retention and mixture of stellar winds and CCSN ejecta until the inferred cluster age. The inferred O and He enhancement may have implications for the formation of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters, as stars formed from this gas would contradict the observed abundances of second-population stars.

Over 700 bright millisecond-duration radio transients, known as fast radio bursts (FRBs), have been identified to date. Nevertheless, the origin of FRBs remains unknown. Two repeating FRBs (FRB 20121102A and FRB 20190520B) have been verified to be associated with persistent radio sources (PRSs), making them the best candidates to study the nature of FRBs. Monitoring the variability in PRSs is essential for understanding their physical nature. We conducted 22 observations of the PRSs linked to FRB 20121102A and FRB 20190520B using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, to study their variability. We have observed significant flux variability for the PRSs of FRB 20121102A and FRB 20190520B, with a confidence level exceeding 99.99%, based on the observations covering the longest timescale recorded to date. The observed variability of the two PRSs exhibits no significant difference in amplitude across both short and long timescales. We found that the radio-derived star formation rates of the two FRB hosts are significantly higher than those measured by the optical Hα emissions, indicating that their host galaxies are highly obscured or most radio emissions are not from star formation processes. The observed timescale of PRS flux evolution constrained the magnetic field of FRB 20121102A with B∥ ≳ 1 mG and FRB 20190520B with B∥ ≳ 0.1 mG.

总结:
Hubble Space Telescope观测了SN 1987A附近的热点，在1994年至2022年期间，共进行了33次观测。通过对这些热点的研究发现，太空望远镜得出了关于SN 1987A周围环绕介质和喷射物相互作用的结论。他们使用椭圆模型拟合了赤道环，确定了它的倾斜角和主轴方向。他们还发现了26个独特的热点，随着时间的推移，在西侧出现了额外的热点。热点的光变曲线在7000到9000天之间达到最大值，这表明它们与减速有关。研究人员提出了热射线中包含了密集的亚结构，这些密集的亚结构嵌入在密度较低的气体中。初速度是相速度，在冲击波离开赤道环时产生断裂，而晚期速度反映了密集亚结构中辐射冲击波的传播。他们估计密集亚结构的体积充填因子和总质量。 <div>
The nearby SN 1987A offers a unique opportunity to investigate the complex shock interaction between the ejecta and circumstellar medium. We track the evolution of the optical hot spots within the equatorial ring (ER) by analyzing 33 Hubble Space Telescope imaging observations between 1994 and 2022. By fitting the ER with an elliptical model, we determine its inclination to be 42.°85 ± 0.°50 with its major axis oriented −6.°24 ± 0.°31 from the west. We identify 26 distinct hot spots across the ER, with additional ones emerging over time, particularly on the western side. The hot spots initially show high velocities ranging from 390 to 1660 km s−1, followed by a deceleration phase around day ∼ 8000. Subsequent velocities vary from 40 to 660 km s−1. The light curves of the hot spots reach maxima between 7000 and 9000 days, suggesting a connection with the deceleration. Many spots are spatially resolved and show elongation perpendicular to the direction of motion, indicative of a short cooling time. To explain these results, we propose that each hot spot comprises dense substructures embedded in less dense gas. The initial velocities are then phase velocities, where the break occurs when the blast wave leaves the ER, while the late velocities reflect the propagation of radiative shocks in the dense substructures. We estimate that the dense substructures have a volumetric filling factor of and a total mass of .

We present the first results of the holographic beam-mapping program for the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME). We describe the implementation of a holographic technique as adapted for CHIME, and introduce the processing pipeline which prepares the raw holographic timestreams for analysis of beam features. We use data from six bright sources across the full 400–800 MHz observing band of CHIME to provide measurements of the copolar and cross-polar beam response in both amplitude and phase for all 1024 dual-polarized feeds in the array. In addition, we present comparisons with independent probes of the CHIME beam, which indicate the presence of polarized beam leakage. Holographic measurements of the beam have already been applied in science with CHIME, e.g., in estimating the detection significance of far-sidelobe fast radio bursts, and in validating the beam models used for CHIME’s first detections of 21 cm emission (in cross-correlation with measurements of large-scale structure from galaxy surveys and the Lyα forest). Measurements presented in this paper, and future holographic results, will provide a unique data set to characterize the CHIME beam and improve the experiment’s prospects for a detection of the baryon acoustic oscillation signal.

<div> 模型、恒星形成、反馈、宇宙学模拟、黑洞反馈
总结:<br /><br />这篇论文讨论了星系性质与暗物质晕体质量的关系，以及反馈环路如何调节恒星形成的问题。在之前的一篇论文中提出了一个称为“最简风险调控模型”的简单超新星反馈模型，并解释了其含义和讨论了其影响。该模型是一个跟踪暗物质晕体周围的重子气体-中心星系大气的质量和能量的会计系统。代数方程的解揭示了低质量暗物质晕体中的恒星形成主要通过扩展晕体而自我调节，最终导致恒星质量对星系风负荷特性不敏感。最重要的是超新星能量与周围气体耦合的比例。然而，僅靠超新星反馈无法扩展高质量暗物质晕体的大气。根据最简风险调控模型，将发生大气收缩危机，这可能是引发强黑洞反馈的原因。该模型还预测，宇宙学模拟中出现的周围介质特性主要取决于其产生的流出的具体能量，我们根据该预测解释了几个数值模拟的定性特性。 <div>
The scaling of galaxy properties with halo mass suggests that feedback loops regulate star formation, but there is no consensus yet about how those feedback loops work. To help clarify discussions of galaxy-scale feedback, Paper I presented a very simple model for supernova feedback that it called the minimalist regulator model. This follow-up paper interprets that model and discusses its implications. The model itself is an accounting system that tracks all of the mass and energy associated with a halo’s circumgalactic baryons—the central galaxy’s atmosphere. Algebraic solutions for the equilibrium states of that model reveal that star formation in low-mass halos self-regulates primarily by expanding the atmospheres of those halos, ultimately resulting in stellar masses that are insensitive to the mass-loading properties of galactic winds. What matters most is the proportion of supernova energy that couples with circumgalactic gas. However, supernova feedback alone fails to expand galactic atmospheres in higher-mass halos. According to the minimalist regulator model, an atmospheric contraction crisis ensues, which may be what triggers strong black hole feedback. The model also predicts that circumgalactic medium properties emerging from cosmological simulations should depend largely on the specific energy of the outflows they produce, and we interpret the qualitative properties of several numerical simulations in light of that prediction.

这篇论文提出了一个新的框架，用于理解星系与其环绕星际介质（CGM）之间的关系。它专注于加热和冷却之间的不平衡如何导致CGM的扩展或收缩。通过跟踪与暗物质晕的重子相关的所有质量和能量，包括它们的引力势能，即使反馈推动了其中一些质子超出了晕的维里半径。我们展示了如何在这个框架内代数地推导出一个星系的平衡状态，并分析了平衡星形成速率如何取决于超新星反馈。我们考虑了改变质量卸载参数的后果，该参数与星系的气体排出速率（）和其星形成速率（）的关系，并得到了挑战常见假设的结果。特别地，我们发现低质量星系的平衡星形成速率通常不敏感于质量卸载，而当质量卸载确实重要时，增加它实际上会导致更多的星形成，因为需要更多的超新星能量来抵抗大气的收缩。<br /><br />总结: 这篇论文提出了一个新的框架，用于理解星系与其环绕星际介质（CGM）之间的关系，重点关注了加热和冷却之间的不平衡如何影响CGM的扩展或收缩。另外，还分析了平衡星形成速率如何取决于超新星反馈以及质量卸载参数的影响。研究发现，低质量星系的平衡星形成速率通常不受质量卸载的影响，且增加质量卸载实际上会导致更多的星形成，因为需要更多的超新星能量来抵抗大气的收缩。 <div>
This paper presents a new framework for understanding the relationship between a galaxy and its circumgalactic medium (CGM). It focuses on how imbalances between heating and cooling cause either expansion or contraction of the CGM. It does this by tracking all of the mass and energy associated with a halo’s baryons, including their gravitational potential energy, even if feedback has pushed some of those baryons beyond the halo’s virial radius. We show how a star-forming galaxy’s equilibrium state can be algebraically derived within the context of this framework, and we analyze how the equilibrium star formation rate depends on supernova feedback. We consider the consequences of varying the mass loading parameter relating a galaxy’s gas mass outflow rate ( ) to its star formation rate ( ) and obtain results that challenge common assumptions. In particular, we find that equilibrium star formation rates in low-mass galaxies are generally insensitive to mass loading, and when mass loading does matter, increasing it actually results in more star formation because more supernova energy is needed to resist atmospheric contraction.

<title>Proposed Importance of HOCO Chemistry: Inefficient Formation of CO2 from CO and OH Reactions on Ice Dust</title>

<div> 关键词: JWST ice observations, CO2 formation, HOCO radical, carboxylic acids, experimental demonstration<br />
总结: <br />
本研究关注JWST冰观测带来的CO2形成反应，重点研究了星际冰中最重要的分子CO2的形成反应。实验证明，CO + OH → CO2 + H的主要产物并非CO2，而是高反应性的自由基HOCO。HOCO自由基后续可能通过氢抽提反应逐步转化为CO2，但也与其他反应竞争，导致生成羧酸（R-COOH）。这些结果凸显了HOCO化学的重要性，鼓励进一步探索这种自由基的化学性质。 <div>
With the advent of JWST ice observations, dedicated studies on the formation reactions of detected molecules are becoming increasingly important. One of the most interesting molecules in interstellar ice is CO2. Despite its simplicity, the main formation reaction considered, CO + OH → CO2 + H through the energetic HOCO* intermediate on ice dust, is subject to uncertainty because it directly competes with the stabilization of HOCO as a final product, which is formed through energy dissipation of HOCO* to the water ice. When energy dissipation to the surface is effective during the reaction, HOCO can be a dominant product. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate that the major product of the reaction is indeed not CO2, but rather the highly reactive radical HOCO. The HOCO radical can later evolve into CO2 through H-abstraction reactions, but these reactions compete with additional reactions, leading to the formation of carboxylic acids (R-COOH). Our results highlight the importance of HOCO chemistry and encourage further exploration of the chemistry of this radical.

<div> Gaia Data Release 3, kinematic data, stellar halo, substructures, metallicity estimates
<br /><br />
总结:本研究利用Gaia DR3目录中的动力学数据以及由Gaia BP/RP光谱稳健推导的金属丰度，探索了银河恒星晕中已知和潜在的新次结构。通过在运动积分空间（即E，Lz和L⊥）中应用基于密度的噪声聚类算法，识别了五个先前已知的次结构：Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus（GSE），Helmi streams，I'itoi和Sequoia以及hot thick disk。此外，我们在这项工作中还发现了NGC 3201和NGC 5139，NGC 3201在相空间和金属丰度上与Arjuna有类似的分布，这可能意味着它们有相同的起源。这项研究发现了三个新的次结构：Prograde Substructure 1（PG1），Prograde Substructure 2（PG2）和Low Energy Group。PG1的Vϕ比典型的GSE成员星体高，被认为是GSE的低偏心率和富金属部分，或者是金属贫穷盘的一部分。PG2与Aleph共享运动学相似性，被认为是其相对较高偏心率的成分或Aleph和盘的混合体。Low Energy Group的金属贫穷成分的金属丰度分布函数均值为[M/H]∼−1.29（与Heracles [M/H]∼−1.26相比），可能与Heracles有关。 <div>
Using kinematic data from the Gaia Data Release 3 catalog, along with metallicity estimates robustly derived from Gaia BP/RP spectra, we have explored the Galactic stellar halo in search of both known and potentially new substructures. By applying the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise clustering algorithm in integrals-of-motion space (i.e., E, Lz, and L⊥ ), we identified five previously known substructures: Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), Helmi streams, I'itoi and Sequoia, and the hot thick disk. We additionally found NGC 3201 and NGC 5139 in this work, and NGC 3201 shares similar distributions in phase space and metallicities to Arjuna, which possibly implies that they have the same origin. Three newly discovered substructures are Prograde Substructure 1 (PG1), Prograde Substructure 2 (PG2), and the Low Energy Group. PG1, with a higher Vϕ than typical GSE member stars, is considered as either a low-eccentricity and metal-rich part of GSE or part of the metal-poor disk. PG2, sharing kinematic similarities with Aleph, is thought to be its relatively highly eccentric component or the mixture of Aleph and the disk. The Low Energy Group, whose metal-poor component of metallicity distribution function has a mean value [M/H] ∼ −1.29 (compared to that of Heracles [M/H] ∼ −1.26), may have associations with Heracles.

这篇文章描述了对JADES-GS-z11-0和JADES-GS-z13-0两个迄今为止JWST观测中最遥远的星系进行的Ultradeep James Webb Space Telescope（JWST）NIRSpec PRISM和光栅光谱的研究。通过这些超深入的观测（分别为75小时和56小时），为我们提供了一个独特的机会来探索这两个星系的红移、恒星特性、紫外线亮度和斜率。对于JADES-GS-z11-0，我们发现了多个发射线，包括[O ii]λλ3726、3729和[Ne iii]λ3869，我们有94%的把握确定了一个光谱红移。对于JADES-GS-z13-0，我们提出了排查线流量和线等价宽度的严格上限。在这个光谱红移下，JADES-GS-z11-0的Lyα断裂可以与一个受阻的Lyα吸收体完美契合。这些结果表明，中性氢分数和Lyman阻尼翼如何影响了类似源的光谱红移的恢复，从而提供了洞察在JWST观测到的远距离星系的光度红移过度预测的原因。此外，我们分析了更新的NIRCam光度测定，计算了这些可解明的源的形态特性，并在JADES-GS-z11-0的南面0.″3处发现了一个类似光度红移的次级源，暗示了早期宇宙中星系是如何通过相互作用而生长的。

We describe new ultradeep James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec PRISM and grating spectra for the galaxies JADES-GS-z11-0 ( ) and JADES-GS-z13-0 ( ), the most distant spectroscopically confirmed galaxy discovered in the first year of JWST observations. The extraordinary depth of these observations (75 hr and 56 hr, respectively) provides a unique opportunity to explore the redshifts, stellar properties, UV magnitudes, and slopes for these two sources. For JADES-GS-z11-0, we find evidence for multiple emission lines, including [O ii]λλ3726, 3729 and [Ne iii]λ3869, resulting in a spectroscopic redshift we determine with 94% confidence. We present stringent upper limits on the emission-line fluxes and line equivalent widths for JADES-GS-z13-0. At this spectroscopic redshift, the Lyα break in JADES-GS-z11-0 can be fit with a damped Lyα absorber with . These results demonstrate how neutral hydrogen fraction and Lyman-damping wings may impact the recovery of spectroscopic redshifts for sources like these, providing insight into the overprediction of the photometric redshifts seen for distant galaxies observed with JWST. In addition, we analyze updated NIRCam photometry to calculate the morphological properties of these resolved sources, and find a secondary source 0.″3 south of JADES-GS-z11-0 at a similar photometric redshift, hinting at how galaxies grow through interactions in the early Universe.

<title>WALLABY Pilot Survey: Gas-rich Galaxy Scaling Relations from Marginally Resolved Kinematic Models</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad84ba</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We present the first set of galaxy scaling relations derived from kinematic models of the Widefield Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY) pilot phase observations. Combining the results of the first and second pilot data releases, there are 236 available kinematic models. We develop a framework for robustly measuring H i disk structural properties from these kinematic models, applicable to the full WALLABY survey. Utilizing this framework, we obtained the H i size, a measure of the rotational velocity, and angular momentum for 148 galaxies. These comprise the largest sample of galaxy properties from an untargeted, uniformly observed, and modeled H i survey to date. We study the neutral atomic hydrogen (H i) size–mass, size–velocity, mass–velocity, and angular momentum–mass scaling relations. We calculate the slope, intercept, and scatter for these scaling relations and find that they are similar to those obtained from other H i surveys. We also obtain stellar masses for 92 of the 148 robustly measured galaxies using multiband photometry through Dark Energy Sky Instrument Legacy Imaging Survey Data Release 10 images. We use a subset of 61 of these galaxies that have consistent optical and kinematic inclinations to examine the stellar and baryonic Tully–Fisher relations as well as the gas fraction–disk stability and gas fraction–baryonic mass relations. These measurements and relations demonstrate the unprecedented resource that WALLABY will represent for resolved galaxy scaling relations in H i.

<title>Evolutionary States and Triplicity of Four Massive Semidetached Binaries with Long-term Decreasing Orbital Periods in the LMC</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The massive semidetached binary with a long-term decreasing orbital period may involve a rapid mass-transfer phase in Case A, and thus, they are good astrophysical laboratories for investigating the evolution of massive binary stars. In this work, by using the long-term observational light curves from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment project and other data in the low-metallicity Large Magellanic Cloud, four semidetached massive binaries with long-term decreases in the orbital periods are detected from 165 EB-type close binaries. It is found that the more massive component in S07798 is filling its Roche lobe, where the period decrease is caused by mass transfer from the primary to the secondary. However, the other three (S03065, S12631, S16873) are semidetached binaries with a lobe-filling secondary where the mass transfer between the components should cause the period to increase if the angular momentum is conservative. The long-term period decreases in these three systems may be caused by angular momentum loss. Additionally, the orbital periods of three systems (S03065, S07798, S16873) are detected to show cyclic variation with periods shorter than 11 yr, which can be plausibly explained by the presence of close-in third bodies in these massive binaries. Based on all of these results, it is suggested that the detected four semidetached binaries almost have multiplicity. The companion stars are crucial for the origin and evolution of these massive close binaries.

<title>Streaming Instabilities in Accreting Protoplanetary Disks: A Parameter Study</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad862d</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The streaming instability (SI) is currently the leading candidate for triggering planetesimal formation in protoplanetary disks. Recently, a novel variation, the “azimuthal-drift” streaming instability (AdSI), was discovered in disks exhibiting laminar gas accretion. Unlike the classical SI, the AdSI does not require pressure gradients and can concentrate dust even at low abundances. We extend previous simulations of the AdSI to explore the impact of dust abundance, accretion-flow strength, pressure gradients, and grain size. For a dimensionless accretion-flow strength αM = 0.1 and particle Stokes number St = 0.1, we find the AdSI produces dust filaments for initial dust-to-gas ratios as low as ϵ = 0.01. For ϵ ≳ 1, maximum dust-to-gas ratios of order 100 are attained, which can be expected to undergo gravitational collapse. Furthermore, even in systems dominated by the classical SI, an accretion flow drives filament formation, without which the disk remains in a state of small-scale turbulence. Our results suggest that an underlying accretion flow facilitates dust concentration and may thus promote planetesimal formation.

<title>Constraints on Remnant Planetary Systems as a Function of Main-sequence Mass with HST/COS</title>

As the descendants of stars with masses less than 8 M⊙ on the main sequence, white dwarfs provide a unique way to constrain planetary occurrence around intermediate-mass stars (spectral types BAF) that are otherwise difficult to measure with radial-velocity or transit surveys. We update the analysis of more than 250 ultraviolet spectra of hot (13,000 K < Teff < 30,000 K), young (less than 800 Myr) white dwarfs collected by the Hubble Space Telescope, which reveals that more than 40% of all white dwarfs show photospheric silicon and sometimes carbon, signposts for the presence of remnant planetary systems. However, the fraction of white dwarfs with metals significantly decreases for massive white dwarfs (MWD > 0.8 M⊙), descendants of stars with masses greater than 3.5 M⊙ on the main sequence, as just % exhibit metal pollution. In contrast, 44% ± 6% of a subset of white dwarfs (MWD < 0.7 M⊙) unbiased by the effects of radiative levitation are actively accreting planetary debris. While the population of massive white dwarfs is expected to be influenced by the outcome of binary evolution, we do not find merger remnants to broadly affect our sample. We connect our measured occurrence rates of metal pollution on massive white dwarfs to empirical constraints of planetary formation and survival around stars with masses greater than 3.5 M⊙ on the main sequence.

<title>Could the Interband Lag of Active Galactic Nucleus Vary Randomly?</title>
<link>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad86bc</link>
<guid>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad86bc</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The interband lags among the optical broad-band continua of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have been intensively explored over the past decade. However, the nature of the lags remains under debate. Here, utilizing two distinct scenarios for AGN variability, i.e., the thermal fluctuation of accretion disk and the reprocessing of both the accretion disk and clouds in the broad line region, we show that, owing to the random nature of AGN variability, the interband lags of an individual AGN would vary from one campaign with a finite baseline to another. Specifically, the thermal fluctuation scenario implies larger variations in the lags than the reprocessing scenario. Moreover, the former predicts a positive correlation between the lag and variation amplitude, while the latter does not result in such a correlation. For both scenarios, averaging the lags of an individual AGN measured with repeated and nonoverlapping campaigns would give rise to a stable lag, which is larger for a longer baseline and gets to saturation for a sufficiently long baseline. However, obtaining the stable lag for an individual AGN is very time-consuming. Alternatively, it can be equivalently inferred by averaging the lags of a sample of AGNs with similar physical properties, and thus can be properly compared with predictions of AGN models. In addition, several new observational tests suggested by our simulations are discussed, as well as the role of the deep high-cadence surveys of the Wide Field Survey Telescope in enriching our knowledge of the lags.
